00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.050
OK.

34630bbb-e690-484b-b12c-d789bee6a2ce-0
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.100
And I'm going to make this.

0da9effa-78cb-428c-8838-8c20ee7c1160-0
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.970
Bigger, OK.

cd52a46b-45ad-4b53-972c-b3936517a6e6-0
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.083
I have the circle again. Oh,
yes, I have to wait. There we

cd52a46b-45ad-4b53-972c-b3936517a6e6-1
00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:24.130
go. Hang on, it was coming up.

6202b9f9-53e7-408a-8aae-063df7c03a4e-0
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.679
Do it the way that I did it last
time because I think it was

6202b9f9-53e7-408a-8aae-063df7c03a4e-1
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.020
having difficulties.

d5468241-ff30-4f1a-b918-72450892de00-0
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.170
OK. Can you see it now?

d58f2b4d-8f23-4d68-8b71-42f2c638ef52-0
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.590
OK, perfect.

94f76dae-4d94-41b3-a1a6-c2a16035feb1-0
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.700
OK, so.

463ebd6b-0d6b-44e8-b185-80b149ded9e7-0
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.620
You could start describing the
short story when you're ready.

3518d944-4532-4a71-b85f-102860ba126e-0
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.219
#START_flowerman OK, so we start
our story. It looks like there

3518d944-4532-4a71-b85f-102860ba126e-1
00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.600
is a.

6422f4a6-e486-4343-8541-b31ec0652f76-0
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.793
Kind of like maybe like a
festival, but it's it's a black

6422f4a6-e486-4343-8541-b31ec0652f76-1
00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:03.920
and white.

42c5ff8e-54ac-40ed-9a45-13041c11b9fc-0
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.948
Page, the only color is the sky
and a person, a person walking

42c5ff8e-54ac-40ed-9a45-13041c11b9fc-1
00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:15.256
their dog on the page that looks
like an older woman walking a

42c5ff8e-54ac-40ed-9a45-13041c11b9fc-2
00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:20.564
dog and it's like a almost like
spooky or scary. And there's a

42c5ff8e-54ac-40ed-9a45-13041c11b9fc-3
00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:25.956
there's a Ferris wheel, there's
a gas station, there's a pop up

42c5ff8e-54ac-40ed-9a45-13041c11b9fc-4
00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:30.927
tent, there's a bar, a bait
shop, a truck. There's another

42c5ff8e-54ac-40ed-9a45-13041c11b9fc-5
00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:35.730
person but they're in black and
white and there's a car.

afc3bb62-79fb-4d2c-84d0-a356653f19e3-0
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.060
That's cut it down in a like a
ditch.

317e7c80-d979-48a2-85e7-b306d8c8c898-0
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.870
And it just it has like a foggy,
creepy feel to it.

c0956bfc-9e51-42bf-937b-9c7ce5d0da05-0
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.126
Looks like it's at night. It
looks like everything is closed

c0956bfc-9e51-42bf-937b-9c7ce5d0da05-1
00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:56.247
and the sky in the background is
purple. And like I said, that's

c0956bfc-9e51-42bf-937b-9c7ce5d0da05-2
00:01:56.247 --> 00:01:59.987
pretty much the only color on
the page. Everything else is

c0956bfc-9e51-42bf-937b-9c7ce5d0da05-3
00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:03.917
pretty much back black and white
other than the woman and her

c0956bfc-9e51-42bf-937b-9c7ce5d0da05-4
00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:06.579
dog, and we can move on to the
next page.

d7f0883f-386c-441f-b3e2-576b901456bb-0
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.659
And on the next page, it's still
night time. It's still got a

d7f0883f-386c-441f-b3e2-576b901456bb-1
00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.168
little bit of a creepy feel
we're moving on to. We've still

d7f0883f-386c-441f-b3e2-576b901456bb-2
00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:18.770
got the.

539680cc-ef97-4986-b4ee-6ec3a2f6a0b2-0
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.680
I think it's a woman. Umm,
whoever it is, it looks like an

539680cc-ef97-4986-b4ee-6ec3a2f6a0b2-1
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.227
older person. They're wearing a
hat, they have a scarf. They're

539680cc-ef97-4986-b4ee-6ec3a2f6a0b2-2
00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:27.890
the only thing in color still.

3810234b-b000-4816-a918-3ecdd5e68e89-0
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.730
There's.

6fc3227d-a135-4bcf-a64a-f8c5a731cd19-0
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.344
Uh, some big buildings like
houses and a cafe, all in black

6fc3227d-a135-4bcf-a64a-f8c5a731cd19-1
00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:42.494
and white. There's some people
out on their balconies. The sky

6fc3227d-a135-4bcf-a64a-f8c5a731cd19-2
00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:47.236
is still like a purplish color.
You could see some people

6fc3227d-a135-4bcf-a64a-f8c5a731cd19-3
00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:52.467
through their windows. You could
see like the the street lights

6fc3227d-a135-4bcf-a64a-f8c5a731cd19-4
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:53.039
are on.

f7be7a9c-b5a3-4ce5-a266-713bb9f6c30c-0
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.507
And it looks like there's a
child walking there in black and

f7be7a9c-b5a3-4ce5-a266-713bb9f6c30c-1
00:02:57.507 --> 00:03:01.336
white as well, and there's like
a motorcycle or some sort of a

f7be7a9c-b5a3-4ce5-a266-713bb9f6c30c-2
00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:02.370
bike on the road.

af6d7521-48b5-4cfa-a121-b88a9a857e1d-0
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.500
And.

0be39814-b6b2-446a-a3b7-6a1923c6f351-0
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.330
{Yeah, we can move on to the
next page.}

e2d44db6-6d3e-43ab-9059-10cd0f69bd37-0
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.431
All right, we still see the I
can't tell if it's a woman or a

e2d44db6-6d3e-43ab-9059-10cd0f69bd37-1
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:21.549
man, but we still see the older
person walking and they've got

e2d44db6-6d3e-43ab-9059-10cd0f69bd37-2
00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.490
like a greenish brown coat and a
a blue hat.

af602044-d3d9-42ea-bd22-84eb4c7bf3a7-0
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.402
Again, they're like the only
thing in color, except the sky,

af602044-d3d9-42ea-bd22-84eb4c7bf3a7-1
00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:32.871
which is still purple. Now
they're walking past some

af602044-d3d9-42ea-bd22-84eb4c7bf3a7-2
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:34.179
different buildings.

63b01b16-8663-4272-b252-f9229d28e359-0
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.469
You could see people in pretty
much all the windows. So we've

63b01b16-8663-4272-b252-f9229d28e359-1
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.864
got like some three story
building, some apartments, some

63b01b16-8663-4272-b252-f9229d28e359-2
00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:46.376
maybe bigger. I don't know if
it's houses or if they're all

63b01b16-8663-4272-b252-f9229d28e359-3
00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:48.250
yeah, but there's a house there.

66f3323a-39c4-44c2-813c-c9aa65f57f71-0
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.390
There's.

dcff55e6-cf79-481c-b1c0-1b59df631276-0
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.878
In the corner it looks like
there's maybe like a fountain or

dcff55e6-cf79-481c-b1c0-1b59df631276-1
00:03:55.878 --> 00:03:59.520
something with some people
sitting by it. There's some

dcff55e6-cf79-481c-b1c0-1b59df631276-2
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.427
people standing under an awning.
The street lights are on.

dcff55e6-cf79-481c-b1c0-1b59df631276-3
00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:04.950
There's a fire hydrant.

781b3672-be71-4a77-8c09-21d38c368bfe-0
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.838
Let's see what some of the
people in the windows are doing.

781b3672-be71-4a77-8c09-21d38c368bfe-1
00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.678
It looks like somebody's
painting. There's a couple in

781b3672-be71-4a77-8c09-21d38c368bfe-2
00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:13.660
one of the windows.

cf8d3b59-e41f-4a29-ae44-9403719719b6-0
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.210
There's somebody sitting.

9a704f69-3968-4e53-a3ee-04dd5a8d0b3f-0
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.995
Most people seem to be sitting.
There's a telescope on top of

9a704f69-3968-4e53-a3ee-04dd5a8d0b3f-1
00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:26.901
one of the buildings, there's
chimneys and they have smoke

9a704f69-3968-4e53-a3ee-04dd5a8d0b3f-2
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.160
coming out of them.

8161f3d0-7e2c-4d08-8b3c-03e03581ab8f-0
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.440
That there's this street is like
a pebbled Street.

b4762a2f-5189-40af-b123-94d0fddda2fd-0
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.570
Umm.

32140823-5005-4871-a63c-3922adf2a4d8-0
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.064
There's a woman outside of one
of the buildings and two men

32140823-5005-4871-a63c-3922adf2a4d8-1
00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:44.670
standing under an awning.

f0ea7187-62e2-49d6-b4f4-8f9005e90304-0
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.150
There's a cola sign.

78b2d15c-d458-4503-b70e-036da00e63ca-0
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.520
{Yeah, we can move on to the
next page.}

fa9e9bac-3f61-44ae-9442-3defbbfbf73b-0
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.367
OK. So things are starting to
come into a little bit more

fa9e9bac-3f61-44ae-9442-3defbbfbf73b-1
00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:03.162
color. Still for the most part,
it's all in black and white, but

fa9e9bac-3f61-44ae-9442-3defbbfbf73b-2
00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:06.260
now there are quite a few people
outside.

4d07e074-e2da-4825-8337-f73f0dd8e31c-0
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.143
Guessing it must have been the
person that we thought earlier

4d07e074-e2da-4825-8337-f73f0dd8e31c-1
00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:16.389
is still in color and now they
are standing on a ladder outside

4d07e074-e2da-4825-8337-f73f0dd8e31c-2
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.109
of the of a house and the house
is also.

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-0
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.242
In color, it has a purple roof.
It's it looks like it's daytime

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-1
00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:28.368
now. Now the sky is blue with
some pink clouds in it. The only

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-2
00:05:28.368 --> 00:05:32.495
thing that's in color is that
person and their house and their

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-3
00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:36.622
grass, even their lawn mower is
in color. They've got a purple

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-4
00:05:36.622 --> 00:05:40.945
roof, they've got blue shutters,
a greenish colored door, and now

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-5
00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:44.678
all these other people are
outside. So we're in the same

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-6
00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:48.674
scene as we were on the last
pages, except now it's daytime.

a18d20e4-3899-4ce0-ad84-2941d6c8bcf0-7
00:05:48.674 --> 00:05:50.050
Now there's way more.

c9616a46-aa16-48ee-8254-1b6efe395702-0
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.542
People outside, like I said,
that house is in color. Even

c9616a46-aa16-48ee-8254-1b6efe395702-1
00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.669
like a tree kind of right by
their yard is in color.

c9616a46-aa16-48ee-8254-1b6efe395702-2
00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.970
Everything else is in black and
white.

af56f5c1-81f5-403d-b241-dd7969dc48b5-0
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.638
Quite a few people outside,
there's somebody in a wheelchair

af56f5c1-81f5-403d-b241-dd7969dc48b5-1
00:06:04.638 --> 00:06:08.858
with a broken leg, there's a a
woman and a child, there's

af56f5c1-81f5-403d-b241-dd7969dc48b5-2
00:06:08.858 --> 00:06:10.750
somebody riding a scooter.

cec00fcb-3364-4bd1-b545-e4ae63ef6374-0
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.630
There are some children outside.

47bb41cf-1cbd-44fd-a385-d4d5466d54c4-0
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.942
And then we could still see
people inside the windows. So

47bb41cf-1cbd-44fd-a385-d4d5466d54c4-1
00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:23.452
even some of the same people
that we saw in the last page, we

47bb41cf-1cbd-44fd-a385-d4d5466d54c4-2
00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:25.150
could see outside the windows.

b9d6135f-cdc2-4684-9d4f-f8aa9a79abef-0
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.580
{Yeah. OK, move on to the next
page.}

819f3d49-a218-4941-8009-32ea68f5a21c-0
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.952
All right. We're starting to see
a little bit more color. We've

819f3d49-a218-4941-8009-32ea68f5a21c-1
00:06:38.952 --> 00:06:43.140
still got the same scene on this
page, still the same person.

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-0
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.760
Appears to be a man is in color
and the tree behind the house is

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-1
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.550
much brighter now. It's like a
orange and red. Even the House

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-2
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.107
is in a bit more color, like
it's a brighter purple on the

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-3
00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:02.587
roof and the grass is really
green. And then most of most

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-4
00:07:02.587 --> 00:07:07.531
everything else is in black and
white, except there is a little

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-5
00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:12.397
girl walking and she is now in
color. So she has red hair. She

b6609cb5-8d32-4c7c-a126-040c7653dad8-6
00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:14.020
has a a yellow shirt.

d551eb99-d2e1-491a-9765-6b38f3a276e4-0
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.957
And a blue skirt on she is the
only other thing that's in

d551eb99-d2e1-491a-9765-6b38f3a276e4-1
00:07:17.957 --> 00:07:22.203
color. There's still some people
outside. There's still some of

d551eb99-d2e1-491a-9765-6b38f3a276e4-2
00:07:22.203 --> 00:07:24.259
the same people in the windows.

7b26d6fa-4647-48b1-b51d-162265d9e478-0
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.480
There's like a A, maybe like a
ice cream cart person, and

7b26d6fa-4647-48b1-b51d-162265d9e478-1
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.457
there's a truck coming down the
street. There's some children on

7b26d6fa-4647-48b1-b51d-162265d9e478-2
00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:38.750
the street as well as some
adults as well.

a515f65a-dec2-4f6c-b1af-d525535f88ae-0
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.530
{Yeah, we can move on to the
next page.}

b962b7a5-33d8-4212-92d7-aa08f1dba649-0
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:53.524
OK, it's still the same scene
and now we are seeing even more

b962b7a5-33d8-4212-92d7-aa08f1dba649-1
00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:55.510
color still the house.

0f0ba3fd-ae68-48e3-974e-fa9e8d15595d-0
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.401
With the purple roof and the red
tree behind it is still in

0f0ba3fd-ae68-48e3-974e-fa9e8d15595d-1
00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:04.836
color. The man is in color, and
now there's some other people

0f0ba3fd-ae68-48e3-974e-fa9e8d15595d-2
00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:08.770
around him who are in color, so
he's standing next to.

fb5c6a49-66c7-4b14-b2ca-a9ab8bb45a36-0
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.520
Um, a different redhead child
with glasses with a.

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-0
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.981
Like a green, like a green
sweater and a blue skirt.

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-1
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:23.036
There's another child standing
there with a hat and a green

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-2
00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:27.158
shirt. There's a little girl
with a ponytail and blonde hair

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-3
00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:31.078
and and even some of the
buildings next door are starting

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-4
00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:35.065
to come into colors. So the
building next door now has red

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-5
00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:39.187
shutters. We could see some
people in the window and they're

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-6
00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:43.580
more in color now. So there's a
woman with like a green robe and

250414be-910d-4f9e-877b-451986ccba98-7
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.269
then there's somebody up.

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-0
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.655
On the top floor that's got a
beard. Downstairs there's a

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-1
00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:54.343
child outside, she's in color.
There's a fire hydrant. There's

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-2
00:08:54.343 --> 00:08:58.659
a man next to the the light
pole, he's in color. He has a

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-3
00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:03.346
like a pinkish color tie. And
then the building behind them is

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-4
00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:07.885
like half in color and half in
black and white. So there's a

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-5
00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:12.647
blue shutters, there's somebody
standing in the window. There's

0417d9d7-b876-4c9e-bd13-30c6e11edff7-6
00:09:12.647 --> 00:09:14.880
somebody like up in the attic.

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-0
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.774
That's in color. And they have
their shutters are open. And

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-1
00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:22.312
then the same thing with the the
house next door on the other

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-2
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.851
side, it's like half in color
and half in black and white. So

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-3
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:29.275
it's just starting to come into
color. You can see some red

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-4
00:09:29.275 --> 00:09:33.042
brick, and then some of the rest
of it is in black and white. And

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-5
00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:36.124
then the awning, 2 of the
awnings are now like purple

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-6
00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:39.720
striped, and then the other ones
are still in black and white.

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-7
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.201
And even the house a little bit
further down to like 2 doors

4ad36a10-c298-4160-a7e4-48880c61be78-8
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:45.770
down is in color. There's
somebody standing.

c9aa0877-e2c1-4169-af23-f30159ef803c-0
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.567
In the upper window with the
shutters open, there's a

c9aa0877-e2c1-4169-af23-f30159ef803c-1
00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:53.090
orangish red wall in the
background behind. Oh, I'm

c9aa0877-e2c1-4169-af23-f30159ef803c-2
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.190

59b7a85b-0c5e-4fd6-8c95-82f745326856-0
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.371
Multi Colored roof, the house
behind that is in color as well.

59b7a85b-0c5e-4fd6-8c95-82f745326856-1
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:03.160
There's.

0cb09dac-d4db-4f09-a647-980e71822827-0
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.466
An older lady who's in color.
There's movers out there in

0cb09dac-d4db-4f09-a647-980e71822827-1
00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:11.404

other people are in black and

0cb09dac-d4db-4f09-a647-980e71822827-2
00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:11.780
white.

debe88bf-696a-44ee-88a4-25fa4645a250-0
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.807
The street is still black and
white and there's so the houses

debe88bf-696a-44ee-88a4-25fa4645a250-1
00:10:16.807 --> 00:10:21.305

and white starting to turn into

debe88bf-696a-44ee-88a4-25fa4645a250-2
00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:24.819
color. The sky is purple and it
has white clouds.

8399c4db-306f-4d9a-a99f-dd332e10703c-0
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.740
{I can move on to the next
page.}

745b037e-4e38-4693-825b-e3a8f50a54ed-0
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.050
And it looks like a.

2898fbb7-a20c-4076-9824-df8b99e3a7cf-0
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.450
Just about in full color now.

c716d60f-156a-4719-95bd-008be3c7a9b0-0
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.732
So it's, it's the same scene,
just some different people out.

c716d60f-156a-4719-95bd-008be3c7a9b0-1
00:10:43.732 --> 00:10:48.617
There's a milk truck, there's a
red car, there's somebody,

c716d60f-156a-4719-95bd-008be3c7a9b0-2

they're selling paintings or
standing with paintings out on

c716d60f-156a-4719-95bd-008be3c7a9b0-3
00:10:53.584 --> 00:10:55.240
the street. There's.

c223026f-5b80-43ca-9b0f-2c6075668c70-0
00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.180
The more children out, there's
some more older people out.

289f2991-de3d-4969-bacf-855de4a8b7b9-0
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.374
There's somebody up on the roof
of the red brick house that's

289f2991-de3d-4969-bacf-855de4a8b7b9-1
00:11:08.374 --> 00:11:09.190
next door.

8ca684f8-15e2-4add-b7ff-78964b6ca671-0
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.624

like just starting to turn red

8ca684f8-15e2-4add-b7ff-78964b6ca671-1
00:11:14.624 --> 00:11:18.723
brick and now it's full color
and everything is pretty much in

8ca684f8-15e2-4add-b7ff-78964b6ca671-2
00:11:18.723 --> 00:11:22.628

bright. There's there's a child

00:11:22.628 --> 00:11:24.189
playing in the fountain.

cf405df1-4336-4f90-93ee-982c79d27292-0

cd9769c3-c407-44e7-a3d4-9a2a87595367-0
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.820
There's some people dancing in
the streets.

2e50d657-6a73-4d18-82ba-39f958194485-0
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.263
Uh, there's still the man with
the wheelchair and the broken

2e50d657-6a73-4d18-82ba-39f958194485-1
00:11:35.263 --> 00:11:39.517
leg. We still see the man who
was originally there living in

2e50d657-6a73-4d18-82ba-39f958194485-2
00:11:39.517 --> 00:11:43.492
the house. And the the little
girl with the red hair and

2e50d657-6a73-4d18-82ba-39f958194485-3
00:11:43.492 --> 00:11:47.398
glasses that is that was
standing next to him. Now he's

00:11:47.398 --> 00:11:49.560
got a grill out. He's grilling.

60293eae-48bc-48db-82e0-f2f79bc04614-0
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.270
Umm.

bbe2eefc-423b-46ae-8ad2-2e053d70f711-0
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.850
{Yeah, we can move on to the

b9066abd-8f80-4bc9-ba83-9fc1478c2044-0
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.319
OK. We're still seeing color.
It's just getting brighter now.

b9066abd-8f80-4bc9-ba83-9fc1478c2044-1
00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:09.322
There's somebody like with a
towel on top of standing on top

b9066abd-8f80-4bc9-ba83-9fc1478c2044-2
00:12:09.322 --> 00:12:11.620
of the roof, like just in a
towel.

af0633b4-721f-4cf3-a599-a99dc0b5dd6d-0
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.698
And there's an older couple
walking down the street, like

af0633b4-721f-4cf3-a599-a99dc0b5dd6d-1
00:12:17.698 --> 00:12:22.277
kind of snuggling together.
There's looks like probably a

af0633b4-721f-4cf3-a599-a99dc0b5dd6d-2

Some people that look like they
might be running.

12def841-2d0a-49a1-8c90-46180ff5c5e2-0
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.430
Um.

7d352600-cdaa-4a33-adb2-622e06d031d9-0
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.440
We don't see the original.

6832d072-b5c0-43be-a41e-19ebc852285b-0
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.690
older man, that was.

2b7e5be3-6a78-42aa-b808-84097217aad3-0
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.739
That, like, was the only thing
in color originally. I don't see

2b7e5be3-6a78-42aa-b808-84097217aad3-1
00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:47.311
him, but he's probably on here
somewhere. Up on the another

2b7e5be3-6a78-42aa-b808-84097217aad3-2
00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:51.002
roof. There is somebody with the
telescope now. So there's an

2b7e5be3-6a78-42aa-b808-84097217aad3-3
00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:53.800
older man and two children with
the telescope.

91c0b70d-4c76-486f-ae1c-8c2082def75c-0
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.040
There's another couple on one of
the other roofs.

b4903798-d501-43d1-b26f-d430a3d82a9b-0
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.010
There's.

b2a1725b-677d-4d55-b95a-5490e31b74b6-0
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.253
A woman like sitting at that,
there's like 2 fountains and

b2a1725b-677d-4d55-b95a-5490e31b74b6-1
00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:09.940
there's a woman in a a pretty
formal dress sitting at one of

b2a1725b-677d-4d55-b95a-5490e31b74b6-2
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.630
the fountains with a man.
There's.

cefc150e-71c5-4a14-b657-ae62f71ee8c6-0
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.700
Like a flower cart or something.
There's a dog by themselves.

e0e650f9-72e1-49bc-96f4-fc0904234173-0
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.910
Many people in the windows.

9a12eaf1-6e19-43eb-b134-128b665fce25-0
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.360
{You move on.}

95edec04-ecde-4e26-86dd-43aa6a8ec7c3-0
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.450
OK, now we're moving back to.

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-0
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.602
One of the original pages where
they were walking down the

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-1
00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:43.961
street and everything was in
black and white except the

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-2
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:48.709
person and now everything is in
color. So we see some people

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-3
00:13:48.709 --> 00:13:53.768
walking down the street, we see
a red roof, a blue roof, a green

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-4
00:13:53.768 --> 00:13:58.438
roof, a purple roof. We see
fountain. The street lights are

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-5
00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:03.109
on so it must be night time.
This is the the scene that had

62e6954b-e31f-4f9f-8a85-cc8d097ba974-6
00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.600
the cafe as well as some of the.

87ff8446-88c5-4363-b1ea-240123e7f887-0
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:11.100
Apartments and houses. The sky
is like a purple and blue color.

5b50ddac-2963-4e5e-9a4c-43f19e5d8725-0
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.620
And there's people on a balcony,
there's people in the windows.

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-0
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.033
{And we can move.} I think it's,
I think it's the same person

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-1
00:14:24.033 --> 00:14:28.094
that was in the original scene
with the blue Hat also. Ohh Yep.

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-2
00:14:28.094 --> 00:14:31.900
And now on the next page, there
they are again. They've got

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-3
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.088
their blue hat, their green coat
looks like an older man, and now

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-4
00:14:36.088 --> 00:14:39.958
he's in a new scene and again,
he's the only thing that's in

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-5
00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.828
color other than the sky. So the
sky is like a really pretty

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-6
00:14:43.828 --> 00:14:47.635
shade of purple and purplish
pink. And we've got some black

0c4c8f01-552a-4320-be23-1752e1e85cbd-7
00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:50.110
and white buildings again with
people.

a6c43047-6ba8-47c3-9bea-816ae171dcd6-0
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.400
In the windows.

c1b8b81c-53ac-4cce-b44a-8f2b75755a88-0
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.826
There's somebody sitting by a
fountain. There's like a duck

c1b8b81c-53ac-4cce-b44a-8f2b75755a88-1
00:14:56.826 --> 00:15:00.737
out there. I can't tell what's
in the man's hand. He has

c1b8b81c-53ac-4cce-b44a-8f2b75755a88-2
00:15:00.737 --> 00:15:04.511
something in his hand and
something next to him, but I

c1b8b81c-53ac-4cce-b44a-8f2b75755a88-3
00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:06.570
can't tell exactly what it is.

217ebadc-2b97-4935-b80a-95f9e995db30-0
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.631
And like a whistle or something
maybe? And there's people like

217ebadc-2b97-4935-b80a-95f9e995db30-1
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:19.041
looking out the windows at him.
The street lamps are on. It's a

217ebadc-2b97-4935-b80a-95f9e995db30-2
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:23.245
little bit foggy still, but it's
not like a creepy scene. It

217ebadc-2b97-4935-b80a-95f9e995db30-3
00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:26.140
looks like a like a nice
nighttime scene.

f08b061b-abf8-468f-86ed-a1aef9404e09-0
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:34.037
And there's a for sale sign in
front of one of the places that

f08b061b-abf8-468f-86ed-a1aef9404e09-1
00:15:34.037 --> 00:15:35.510
stone Stone Road.

ec14bc0e-70be-41b8-96d5-d21bc4960c0d-0
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.310
{And we can move on to the next
page.}

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-0
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.760
And now there's a little girl
who has a flower. Looks like

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-1
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.933
somebody maybe just gave her the
flower, maybe the older man.

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-2
00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:54.039
It's a purple flower. And she's
really excited. Her eyes are

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-3
00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:58.010
really big. She has a big smile
on her face. She has a red

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-4
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:02.318
dress. She has a yellow shirt,
yellow shoes, a yellow headband,

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-5
00:16:02.318 --> 00:16:06.490
kind of reddish brown hair. And
then there's a another man in

3ef510d3-4126-48f5-8ac1-ede06ec334e4-6
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.259
the window looking out at her,
and he has a red flower.

910f379b-d226-46f6-96f4-e91d561c0cad-0
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.085
And he has a red tie on and we
can kind of see the the original

910f379b-d226-46f6-96f4-e91d561c0cad-1
00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:17.772
older man and he's walking away.
We only see like part of him,

910f379b-d226-46f6-96f4-e91d561c0cad-2
00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:21.166
but he's still in color. The
little girl is in color, the

910f379b-d226-46f6-96f4-e91d561c0cad-3
00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:25.028
other man is partially in color,
and everything else is black and

910f379b-d226-46f6-96f4-e91d561c0cad-4
00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:28.422
white. And she's out on her
front porch. #END_flowerman I

910f379b-d226-46f6-96f4-e91d561c0cad-5
00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.120
can move on to the next page.

93f9be0d-bec2-432e-9418-f3e2f16acb02-0
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:32.860
And that's it.

db722d0b-676f-49ca-973a-0ec37bb33f7c-0
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.070
Yeah, let me see what we have
next.

691d49b9-5c45-4154-be53-8a1d57a7aecc-0
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.960
But we have another short story.

b3165c19-3fd7-419b-9404-aa1bcc0b9c5d-0
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.150
OK.

84cba1bd-3e82-4660-ba9e-e1c11d59bd47-0
00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.640
Yep, OK.

edaa80d1-4ec0-4dbd-bfc4-aa57cb775a89-0
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.920
So I'm going to put this in.

0653c06f-9e37-4d75-aa22-d492681a0dcb-0
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.730
And now I'm going to share my
screen.

2f390df5-ba9f-420f-9b92-f689625836e7-0
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.210
OK.

2e82c014-642b-45a0-b475-c9aa8cf2a91c-0
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.410
OK.

becaa92d-f31b-4337-8771-af9e36470fab-0
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.460
So you could start when you're
ready. Same thing as before.

4a873bfa-c86f-4849-bbde-b7eccccfa606-0
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:29.340
OK. All right. So we have some.

86af542a-3235-45ff-a94a-4abf0a8dcf1f-0
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.476
#START_journey I think it's
called sepia colored pages. It's

86af542a-3235-45ff-a94a-4abf0a8dcf1f-1
00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:38.387
like the brownish tone. So
everything on the page is pretty

86af542a-3235-45ff-a94a-4abf0a8dcf1f-2
00:17:38.387 --> 00:17:42.560
much this brownish tone except
for one thing. And it is red and

86af542a-3235-45ff-a94a-4abf0a8dcf1f-3
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.536
it appears to be a scooter. On
the page we see some children

86af542a-3235-45ff-a94a-4abf0a8dcf1f-4
00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:50.578
outside. There's three children
that are together: one's on a

86af542a-3235-45ff-a94a-4abf0a8dcf1f-5
00:17:50.578 --> 00:17:54.619
bike, one is on a skateboard and
the one on the bike is like.

3de5fcc1-ecf9-4ca7-a4a6-a878b1b02d30-0
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.632
Giving a high 5 to another child
that's standing next to him.

3de5fcc1-ecf9-4ca7-a4a6-a878b1b02d30-1
00:17:59.632 --> 00:18:03.680
There's another child with a
purple. Oh, there's purple, so

3de5fcc1-ecf9-4ca7-a4a6-a878b1b02d30-2
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.300
there's a purple marker.

58a88ab0-4bc9-45be-8d28-735bf6227cbf-0
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.827
It looks like a boy in a striped
shirt wearing shorts. He's got a

58a88ab0-4bc9-45be-8d28-735bf6227cbf-1
00:18:10.827 --> 00:18:14.722
purple marker. There's a street
light. The street light is is

58a88ab0-4bc9-45be-8d28-735bf6227cbf-2
00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:17.990
kind of reddish. You can kind of
see the red color.

d3c8cf7d-ac8d-470c-8e08-84faf9f9510a-0
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.349
There is somebody sitting
outside, maybe a girl with the

d3c8cf7d-ac8d-470c-8e08-84faf9f9510a-1
00:18:23.349 --> 00:18:27.945
red scooter. She's sitting on
like a a front stoop and then we

d3c8cf7d-ac8d-470c-8e08-84faf9f9510a-2
00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:29.770
can see inside the house.

d3cc0433-9090-4389-97cc-04521a212699-0
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.757
Inside the house we've got,
there's a woman wearing a skirt

d3cc0433-9090-4389-97cc-04521a212699-1
00:18:35.757 --> 00:18:40.258
in the kitchen. There's a man
upstairs in an office on a

d3cc0433-9090-4389-97cc-04521a212699-2
00:18:40.258 --> 00:18:42.470
computer, and behind him is.

0fb540b9-5b72-4ae6-bf76-db4c7df4f4ab-0
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.156
Are some bookshelves and there's
quite a few books. And then

0fb540b9-5b72-4ae6-bf76-db4c7df4f4ab-1
00:18:47.156 --> 00:18:51.330
there's another child inside and
another room sitting on a couch.

7e1e37b4-66ed-4b12-bdc0-793220a9c86e-0
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.081
Kind of looks like they're
looking at like a cell phone.

7e1e37b4-66ed-4b12-bdc0-793220a9c86e-1
00:18:56.081 --> 00:18:59.411
Not sure what time period this
is, but it looks like they're

7e1e37b4-66ed-4b12-bdc0-793220a9c86e-2
00:18:59.411 --> 00:19:00.940
looking at a cell phone and.

bc82ed03-9b31-4c3b-8e4b-c129be2cc690-0
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.800
Um.

479aea10-801f-461c-bc3c-b93b93f8acd6-0
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.248
Yeah, and everything is kind of
sepia colored. Other than that,

479aea10-801f-461c-bc3c-b93b93f8acd6-1
00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:13.568
the red scooter and the purple
marker are the only things that

479aea10-801f-461c-bc3c-b93b93f8acd6-2
00:19:13.568 --> 00:19:14.460
are in color.

b5e06fa6-caa8-4e83-b6fb-8e5bde0d3e9f-0
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.840
{We can move on to the next
page.}

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-0
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.980
OK, so we've moved inside. We've
got the mom in the kitchen,

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-1
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.970
she's cooking something. She's
stirring a pot. She is on the

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-2
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.025
telephone, telephones attached
to the wall. The girl has gone

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-3
00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:34.950
inside. She's in the kitchen
with her mom with mom's on the

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-4
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.875
telephone, so she's not really
paying attention to her. The

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-5
00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:42.603
scooter, the red scooter, is
inside with both of them as

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-6
00:19:42.603 --> 00:19:46.790
well. So everything else is kind
of just like a brownish color,

b4b4f131-9343-4620-83a3-af231978a131-7
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.359
except that red scooter.

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-0
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:52.109
Now the girl goes upstairs to
where her dad is. Her dad's

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-1
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:55.979
still on his computer. He's not
paying any attention to her.

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-2
00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:59.595
He's just looking at the
computer away from her. She now

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-3
00:19:59.595 --> 00:20:03.402
has a red kite and she's like
holding on to the back of his

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-4
00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:07.525
chair, like up on her tip toes,
trying to see what he's doing or

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-5
00:20:07.525 --> 00:20:11.459
what he's looking at. And then
she goes to where probably her

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-6
00:20:11.459 --> 00:20:15.138
sister is, which is on the
couch. Her sister's not paying

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-7
00:20:15.138 --> 00:20:18.945
any attention to her. She's
sitting on her phone or looking

3f156a87-7d53-4ba7-a566-8a2f216ab6c4-8
00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:19.769
at something.

39694753-f503-47be-a3c5-eb26d65235f1-0
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.155
And she sits on the couch and
the girl has like a red, I don't

39694753-f503-47be-a3c5-eb26d65235f1-1
00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:26.503
know, maybe a ball or something.
So in each of them she's got a

39694753-f503-47be-a3c5-eb26d65235f1-2
00:20:26.503 --> 00:20:29.694
red something. She has a red
scooter in the picture with her

39694753-f503-47be-a3c5-eb26d65235f1-3
00:20:29.694 --> 00:20:32.989
mom. She has a red kite in the
picture with her dad and then a

39694753-f503-47be-a3c5-eb26d65235f1-4
00:20:32.989 --> 00:20:36.337
red ball in the picture with her
sister. That's really the only

39694753-f503-47be-a3c5-eb26d65235f1-5
00:20:36.337 --> 00:20:37.750
thing that's in color here.

5fcdb9c9-983e-40eb-9245-4c641c10f4df-0
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.422
Then move on to the next page
and she just looks really sad.

5fcdb9c9-983e-40eb-9245-4c641c10f4df-1
00:20:42.422 --> 00:20:46.039
She's in her bedroom and she's
just kind of sitting there with

5fcdb9c9-983e-40eb-9245-4c641c10f4df-2
00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:49.598
her arms crossed. She has a cat
in her bedroom. Everything is

5fcdb9c9-983e-40eb-9245-4c641c10f4df-3
00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:53.158
sort of that brownish color and
it just looks like like she's

5fcdb9c9-983e-40eb-9245-4c641c10f4df-4
00:20:53.158 --> 00:20:55.339
just sad and lonely and that
picture.

aa31a56e-baba-4349-b137-bb6d3bd98125-0
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.810
{And we can move on.}

7e1f6550-64ff-4b77-a4d7-d994c06622b7-0
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.985
OK, so we are. We're still in
the bedroom, but now she sees

7e1f6550-64ff-4b77-a4d7-d994c06622b7-1
00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:06.840
there's a.

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-0
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.800
A red marker. The cat has gotten
up. So the cat's gotten up and

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-1
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.869
it's like right where the cat
was sitting. So we've got a red

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-2
00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:19.873
marker and we have some papers
on the floor and they're just

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-3
00:21:19.873 --> 00:21:24.204
kind of sprung strewn about. And
she's looking at the red marker.

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-4
00:21:24.204 --> 00:21:28.208
She's in her bedroom and we move
on to the next page and she

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-5
00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:32.343
picks up the red marker and she
starts drawing on the wall and

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-6
00:21:32.343 --> 00:21:36.674
she's drawing like a doorway. So
she's drawing like a red doorway

24d37b4b-dc3d-4feb-8bde-51d5e7f03c3c-7
00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:38.250
with the marker and she.

58165a30-261c-4405-b104-e93ed340301c-0
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.526
Opens the door, so it turns into
a real door. She opens the door

58165a30-261c-4405-b104-e93ed340301c-1
00:21:42.526 --> 00:21:46.194
and we see her running through
and we see this in color. So the

58165a30-261c-4405-b104-e93ed340301c-2
00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:49.519
door is red and where she's
running into is green. And we

58165a30-261c-4405-b104-e93ed340301c-3
00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:53.016
could still see like the little
papers that are on the floor

58165a30-261c-4405-b104-e93ed340301c-4
00:21:53.016 --> 00:21:56.799
that were behind her. So we know
that she's coming from the room,

58165a30-261c-4405-b104-e93ed340301c-5
00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.150
the bedroom. {move on to the
next page.}

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-0
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.430
As she's entered, like a magical
land, so she's coming with the

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-1
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.991
door. So the outside of the door
is on a tree. So it's like she

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-2
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:15.125
was inside the tree and now
she's coming out. She has the

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-3
00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:19.757
red marker in her hand and she's
in like a forest, but it's like

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-4
00:22:19.757 --> 00:22:24.104
a like a really pretty forest
with lanterns hanging from the

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-5
00:22:24.104 --> 00:22:28.166
trees and their string lights
hanging from the trees and

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-6
00:22:28.166 --> 00:22:31.872
everything is green,
everything's in color, the red

ceddd9fe-611b-4020-8f5c-56440ac64c18-7
00:22:31.872 --> 00:22:32.300
door's

1337fb6b-2592-41e5-9d69-ba74518c8174-0
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.293
in color, the lanterns are like
a bluish color. It looks like

1337fb6b-2592-41e5-9d69-ba74518c8174-1
00:22:37.293 --> 00:22:42.030
there's a little stream there
and she's just kind of looking

1337fb6b-2592-41e5-9d69-ba74518c8174-2
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.350
up at the lights.

93a1754b-50a6-4b67-af54-3e3825a562e5-0
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.370
I think just to see where she's
at.

d8ffb9f8-32f5-4431-8e93-4ea002417e93-0
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.470
{We can move on to the next
page.}

c2caa087-4ee6-44e5-a1c2-b11c63a15401-0
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.420
And so she walks over to a pier.

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-0
00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.013
And she's standing on the pier
looking in the water. She's

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-1
00:23:00.013 --> 00:23:04.054
looking down at the water. She's
still holding the red marker.

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-2
00:23:04.054 --> 00:23:07.902
And you can kind of see the
reflection of the red marker in

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-3
00:23:07.902 --> 00:23:11.750
the water. I could kind of see
the reflection of one of the

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-4
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.662
lanterns in the water as well.
So there's still the lanterns

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-5
00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:19.895
and the string lights above her.
And she walks to the edge of the

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-6
00:23:19.895 --> 00:23:23.679
pier and she starts drawing a
red boat and she's just like

7c702c8b-5eae-46e8-ae90-a46cc6cdf017-7
00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.950
drawing it, and it turns into a
real boat. So she.

4ebebb56-fb06-4200-a22e-ebaac22d276d-0
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:31.362
Leaves the pier, she goes into
the boat and we see her sitting

4ebebb56-fb06-4200-a22e-ebaac22d276d-1
00:23:31.362 --> 00:23:33.860
inside the boat on the last
picture.

9e53fc99-52c0-4610-96d2-ceab2e006cce-0
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.650
{You can move on to the next
page.}

a23776c5-397e-4020-bcec-ebbbb1b9cb25-0
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.948
And the red boat is leading her.
The stream is going up to a

a23776c5-397e-4020-bcec-ebbbb1b9cb25-1
00:23:44.948 --> 00:23:50.020
giant castle. So we see her in
the boat and we see.

146dd9e1-1b4e-48fe-9a7a-b45a6911c122-0
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.438
Like a a brick bridge and we see
more water around the castle. So

146dd9e1-1b4e-48fe-9a7a-b45a6911c122-1
00:23:56.438 --> 00:24:01.203
the castle is like surrounded by
water. It's almost like its own

146dd9e1-1b4e-48fe-9a7a-b45a6911c122-2
00:24:01.203 --> 00:24:03.550
little island. And there's like.

f151d73c-20e4-4890-b7d6-fdc200a9bf18-0
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.710
Golds.

77a89784-0d6f-4ba7-933e-330a3da64571-0
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:10.989
Domes and top of the castle
there's some, there's a bunch of

77a89784-0d6f-4ba7-933e-330a3da64571-1
00:24:10.989 --> 00:24:15.400
chimneys, some flags. On the top
of the chimneys there's.

e449fe47-22fa-4eb8-9826-14f5d5ee97b7-0
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.873
I can't tell if there's
somebody. I think there's like

e449fe47-22fa-4eb8-9826-14f5d5ee97b7-1
00:24:19.873 --> 00:24:22.860
two people standing kind of near
the front.

03cc2fa2-b396-4bac-9c46-dd4329cc49fc-0
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.511
It looks like there might be
another person up on top, so

03cc2fa2-b396-4bac-9c46-dd4329cc49fc-1
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:32.020
it's a very big castle. It's
giant.

74fbfc27-227c-4854-b3e7-d068f148f1f2-0
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.970
Lots of levels. Lots of.

7b920514-ddd3-4df5-a2c6-2329608644fa-0
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:44.070
Intricate details to it. There's
a couple bridges.

1cc308b2-bdb9-464e-b8b4-bd26a5b99836-0
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.098
There is like lots of levels and
lots of different looks like it.

1cc308b2-bdb9-464e-b8b4-bd26a5b99836-1
00:24:49.098 --> 00:24:53.097
I mean if you were inside of it,
it would be really big and

1cc308b2-bdb9-464e-b8b4-bd26a5b99836-2
00:24:53.097 --> 00:24:56.030
really hard to find your way
where you are.

47fcee72-fd09-404c-8ec1-0dfae57c5414-0
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.278
There's a boat on top of one of
the bridges and another boat

47fcee72-fd09-404c-8ec1-0dfae57c5414-1
00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:02.750
underneath the bridge.

fc65cb9b-3891-4f12-b36a-861977e987a4-0
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.580


293674ed-0cae-4429-ac51-6e279406131d-0
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.957
There's some water coming out,
like like waterfalls out of a

293674ed-0cae-4429-ac51-6e279406131d-1
00:25:09.957 --> 00:25:11.360
couple of the windows.

7e5b7d5c-b6b8-444a-bc30-8ad32f365605-0
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.990
There's a windmill in the
background.

cefd1b53-32a6-4f6d-9b2a-8a6c9f49f555-0
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.610
{And yeah, we can move on to the
next page.}

29278d6a-a40b-4879-9f7e-cd6d4da5d43e-0
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:36.120
Alright, so she arrives at the
castle. There's what appeared to

29278d6a-a40b-4879-9f7e-cd6d4da5d43e-1
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.870
be guards out front.

9176597e-5d43-4895-ad9d-1d626a940a44-0
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.725
They're waving at her like she's
welcome there, so there's

9176597e-5d43-4895-ad9d-1d626a940a44-1
00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:46.690
several guards dressed in yellow
out front.

da9145f6-5352-4455-b5b8-cb460553127c-0
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.140
There's some gondolas going
around the castle.

79b387fb-ab3a-4f29-9b2d-29c82c8b66ac-0
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.680
Um, so there's.

12aa598e-70a3-4100-98de-1aab69cd413e-0
00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.590
3 gondolas.

d8072d65-c4b9-4e9c-9c0e-766a6b3e8a5b-0
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.100
Umm.

9e29041c-0e4b-4e80-a81f-8e0950aa3998-0
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.620
Going around the castle there
is.

e7799192-eb7c-4cb5-9553-9a77cfd8eaed-0
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.160
Gold domes on top, there's.

4af955e0-c869-4906-aa84-8188ff81d49c-0
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.383
See the water like the waterfall
outside the castle. We see

4af955e0-c869-4906-aa84-8188ff81d49c-1
00:26:13.383 --> 00:26:17.986
there's a guard in one of the
towers and then there's 12345

4af955e0-c869-4906-aa84-8188ff81d49c-2
00:26:17.986 --> 00:26:22.972
guards standing like right where
she's coming in. She's still on

4af955e0-c869-4906-aa84-8188ff81d49c-3
00:26:22.972 --> 00:26:23.970
her red boat.

4bcc4daa-b101-49d2-93c7-6265a966a9e9-0
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.970
And.

dda8327b-88a5-4eb9-bd5a-d34a8f1c307a-0
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.880
{Yeah, we can move on to the
next page.}

7a0d980c-d040-4c0d-8339-eed9cf361413-0
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.574
OK, her boat is about to go to
is at the edge, like she's about

7a0d980c-d040-4c0d-8339-eed9cf361413-1
00:26:38.574 --> 00:26:42.937
to fall down the waterfall, and
there's still guards in the

7a0d980c-d040-4c0d-8339-eed9cf361413-2
00:26:42.937 --> 00:26:47.737
tower. There's still there's two
gondolas in this picture, and it

7a0d980c-d040-4c0d-8339-eed9cf361413-3
00:26:47.737 --> 00:26:51.010
looks like she's about to fall
off the edge.

c417c923-3aba-4ddc-8ac4-d290d567ce8e-0
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.437
And there's a waterfall there
and on the next page she's

c417c923-3aba-4ddc-8ac4-d290d567ce8e-1
00:26:58.437 --> 00:27:02.420
falling and she's drawing with
her red marker as she's falling.

c417c923-3aba-4ddc-8ac4-d290d567ce8e-2
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.404
So it's like a semi circle, like
maybe she's drawing a ball and

c417c923-3aba-4ddc-8ac4-d290d567ce8e-3
00:27:06.404 --> 00:27:10.200
then yeah, below her is the red
boat. So the red boat's just

c417c923-3aba-4ddc-8ac4-d290d567ce8e-4
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.010
falling down.

25c92a94-0920-4212-9095-4f090fc783a4-0
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.960
We can move on to the next page.

e4fd212e-df8d-4b05-8325-dcd7c32537a3-0
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.733
And now she's in a hot air
balloon. So it's a red hot air

e4fd212e-df8d-4b05-8325-dcd7c32537a3-1
00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:25.447
balloon. So she was drawing,
that's what she was drawing, the

e4fd212e-df8d-4b05-8325-dcd7c32537a3-2
00:27:25.447 --> 00:27:29.280
hot air balloon. There's still
two people at the tower. They're

e4fd212e-df8d-4b05-8325-dcd7c32537a3-3
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.580
like.

21e9eefc-aa91-4680-96c1-46e7f883e4ae-0
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.542
Waving their arms at her as she
flies away and she's waving back

21e9eefc-aa91-4680-96c1-46e7f883e4ae-1
00:27:35.542 --> 00:27:36.200
at them.

84d2778e-a4d5-4ebe-80c4-d5534e7f9bfc-0
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.330
There's like a.

5e52422d-20a8-4c11-807c-9fe1e27b25b5-0
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.820
A little.

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-0
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.292
I don't know what they're
called, but it's like a little

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-1
00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:50.019
spinny thing on top of the
tower. So it's like a spinny

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-2
00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:53.878
north-south, East-West type
thing with a boat design. And

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-3
00:27:53.878 --> 00:27:58.070
then on the next page she's up
in the so she was up in the sky

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-4
00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:01.930
like she's in, she's in the
clouds on that page. And then

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-5
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.989
the next page, I'm not sure
what's happening. We've got like

0086f35f-e331-4bb8-9eb8-d9441e9cfc5f-6
00:28:05.989 --> 00:28:07.520
a purple bird and then.

7466e596-b888-4048-b6cb-13f675c8272a-0
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.960
I don't know what that is.

334d49a2-2b43-4800-9c6b-0324d71693ab-0
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.982
It's like a, I mean kind of
almost looks like a train or a

334d49a2-2b43-4800-9c6b-0324d71693ab-1
00:28:19.982 --> 00:28:20.730
sort of a.

0630323e-19f0-4b3a-bb16-8d6de4b2f71e-0
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.710
I don't know. It's up in the sky
though, and it has a.

d6f43aa4-b5eb-4420-8da7-83f766171807-0
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:28.620
Umm.

cb145843-9ab4-4830-8523-2a9389f914e2-0
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.640
Has a wheel.

9b12dd06-7c90-46cf-8a84-91fe8a6bd734-0
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.160
The propeller.

cda9d8ac-c825-49cc-aabf-4eb764102555-0
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.160
Maybe some sort of a?

fb2a7aa2-4fa9-4353-8865-ac66b22cd10f-0
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.780
Plane but there's like, I don't
know, it's like it.

3f5265de-d7d6-4040-a757-07bdc0407f43-0
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.929
It kind of looks like a train. I
don't know exactly what it is

3f5265de-d7d6-4040-a757-07bdc0407f43-1
00:28:43.929 --> 00:28:47.113
because it's up in the sky and
then there's a couple other

3f5265de-d7d6-4040-a757-07bdc0407f43-2
00:28:47.113 --> 00:28:50.458
things next to it, but I don't
know what those are either. So

3f5265de-d7d6-4040-a757-07bdc0407f43-3
00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:54.020
we can move on to the next page.
Maybe we'll find out more there.

0cfb573c-a625-49d3-8b34-6cf1c7c69565-0
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.638
OK, so she's looking. So, so we
see her in the, the red hot air

0cfb573c-a625-49d3-8b34-6cf1c7c69565-1
00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:03.724
balloon and she's looking at
these people. OK, so now we've

0cfb573c-a625-49d3-8b34-6cf1c7c69565-2
00:29:03.724 --> 00:29:08.151
got the there's the purple bird
and it's got a really long tail,

0cfb573c-a625-49d3-8b34-6cf1c7c69565-3
00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:09.990
like a curly tail and then.

6daca5e7-9c33-4459-a29c-f538f3f83b37-0
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.820
I guess those are like, I don't
know, like flying.

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-0
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.444
Flying something that they're
sitting on. So there's people on

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-1
00:29:21.444 --> 00:29:25.641
these like flying objects and
one of the people has a big net

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-2
00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:29.634
and it's trying to catch the
purple bird. And it's like, I

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-3
00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:33.763
mean they're like off. They're
like almost at the very edge,

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-4
00:29:33.763 --> 00:29:37.892
almost off of the ship. I don't
know what I would call it. I

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-5
00:29:37.892 --> 00:29:42.292
would let's just call it a ship.
So they're like hanging off the

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-6
00:29:42.292 --> 00:29:46.489
edge of the ship trying to catch
the bird. There's still that

5b5e587d-c2b3-42ca-b235-2f7caa039064-7
00:29:46.489 --> 00:29:46.759
big.

6218ece0-301f-4353-9acf-88470ef511b5-0
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.386
Engine train, looking thing in
the sky behind it and they're up

6218ece0-301f-4353-9acf-88470ef511b5-1
00:29:52.386 --> 00:29:56.576
in the cloud. She's just kind of
looking at all of this, still

6218ece0-301f-4353-9acf-88470ef511b5-2
00:29:56.576 --> 00:30:00.700
holding her red marker {and we
can move on to the next page}.

988f9daa-f015-4c31-ac84-20cfecf78dab-0
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.180
Now she's next to all of this.

24ff6ec9-085e-475f-9171-4ceef5b565e6-0
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.780
Sort of big.

d6e67972-096d-480e-a79d-9616515a590a-0
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.600
Like engine-y train looking
thing.

fbe7e41a-c1be-4b11-8864-160fdb833734-0
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.410
Still up in the sky. There's
some people on it now.

6f2787c5-5949-486d-9b6c-ad47341162a9-0
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.081
It looks like they captured the
bird and they put it in a cage

6f2787c5-5949-486d-9b6c-ad47341162a9-1
00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:33.943
and now it's on that big like
train ish thing. So they like so

6f2787c5-5949-486d-9b6c-ad47341162a9-2
00:30:33.943 --> 00:30:35.660
from like these little tiny.

afcf62af-b060-4a16-964d-758565296635-0
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:42.322
Ships. They have brought it down
to like this big giant train

afcf62af-b060-4a16-964d-758565296635-1
00:30:42.322 --> 00:30:42.950
thingy.

a09ba57f-0595-4add-b177-f412cf0a6af0-0
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.250
{And we can move on to the next
page.}

e52f4e9b-b908-4bdd-b5f7-f1980a101edd-0
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:54.701
OK, now she's stepped off of her
hot air balloon. She is walking

e52f4e9b-b908-4bdd-b5f7-f1980a101edd-1
00:30:54.701 --> 00:31:00.060
on the train thingy, like on a
little bridge part of it,

e52f4e9b-b908-4bdd-b5f7-f1980a101edd-2
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.010
there's people up above there's
a bridge.

251046de-7d13-4153-a009-ba14ce8ca5b2-0
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.504
That's on the train. There's
three people walking and they

251046de-7d13-4153-a009-ba14ce8ca5b2-1
00:31:09.504 --> 00:31:11.390
have the bird in a cage.

c9094e3a-f78f-4c15-b055-2e14847ca86d-0
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.990
And they're bringing it into the
interior.

dd04facd-bb2e-4167-b9d2-8a99271e7b2c-0
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.480
She's still got her red marker
on the next page we've got.

295ab5a1-6af8-4f7e-a430-1676775262b4-0
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.540
Two people that are like guards.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.450
They're wearing like.

b5d83a7b-8b76-434e-bcf5-367321f33913-0
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.680
Armor.

db7f99c9-5798-4f9b-a3a6-25de34e4c545-0
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.630
Um and holding?

dd9a2ed5-d7c0-46ce-beb8-8ec90304f835-0
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.290
Big Spears, and they have the
bird and they have the bird

dd9a2ed5-d7c0-46ce-beb8-8ec90304f835-1
00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.508
inside a cage. They're like
guarding this bird. She's

dd9a2ed5-d7c0-46ce-beb8-8ec90304f835-2
00:31:40.508 --> 00:31:45.430
walking up a ladder, peeking in,
and she's got her red marker.

dce81911-4d22-4074-87bb-8b932201eedd-0
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.710
{Move on to the next.}

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-0
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.928
So they see her, she captures
the birge, takes the bird, they

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-1
00:31:54.928 --> 00:31:59.028
see her and they kind of got
like that ohh no type look. And

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-2
00:31:59.028 --> 00:32:02.927
they one of them is like
dropping his spear and the other

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-3
00:32:02.927 --> 00:32:07.095
ones kind of holding it out to
the side and they're not happy

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-4
00:32:07.095 --> 00:32:11.196
that she's taking the bird. Now
we see her letting the bird,

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-5
00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:14.961
releasing the bird, she's
letting the bird go. So she's

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-6
00:32:14.961 --> 00:32:18.994
like off at the edge of this
train thingy and she's letting

dcf2e694-ccb0-44dc-b75f-c4ba09361517-7
00:32:18.994 --> 00:32:20.809
the bird go. Umm, they are.

00558fac-064b-47ac-877a-fa02fff6614d-0
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.509
Chasing her, we can see the
whole interior of this thing and

00558fac-064b-47ac-877a-fa02fff6614d-1
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:28.019
there's there's quite a few
people inside and you can kind

00558fac-064b-47ac-877a-fa02fff6614d-2
00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:31.708
of see like all the mechanics of
how it's working and they're

00558fac-064b-47ac-877a-fa02fff6614d-3
00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:35.040
chasing her with their Spears.
There's somebody on top.

02a07476-97c4-43c7-bd51-7f45532358dd-0
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.200
Pointing at her.

c427a044-9763-4224-b703-8ce6993540ee-0
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:43.430
And the sky is really dark, the
clouds are really dark, and

c427a044-9763-4224-b703-8ce6993540ee-1
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.830
she's even put down her marker
to let the bird go.

d1a6ed84-9090-4296-9837-23b1a0f56546-0
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.410
{And let's move on to the next
page.}

dee387fa-36e1-44d8-b849-a131eb2be4b3-0
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.310
And they captured her, and her
red marker is falling.

c1aff693-bf77-4d3c-9cb5-e998803f1eb3-0
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:05.254
So there's two guards that have
her, and then the person that

c1aff693-bf77-4d3c-9cb5-e998803f1eb3-1
00:33:05.254 --> 00:33:09.293
was standing up above that was
pointing at her is now down

c1aff693-bf77-4d3c-9cb5-e998803f1eb3-2
00:33:09.293 --> 00:33:13.606
there with them as well and he
looks like he's maybe some sort

c1aff693-bf77-4d3c-9cb5-e998803f1eb3-3
00:33:13.606 --> 00:33:15.250
of royalty or something.

580943a3-9a98-4ff8-bf3e-882a8f61cb40-0
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.330
And then on the next page, she's
in the cage.

395ec98a-9ed3-4a03-9062-3d14bdba0d8c-0
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.950
She's in a cage that's similar
to what the.

6b55dcae-7f0c-4bd5-9d8f-39f5f432c583-0
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:32.003
Bird was in um and they're like
turning a wheel and she's like

6b55dcae-7f0c-4bd5-9d8f-39f5f432c583-1
00:33:32.003 --> 00:33:33.120
below the.

26e47db3-1e99-4444-8f7e-1edcc3d9c268-0
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.100
Train.

a89b2c92-b341-464c-8ceb-1ce4f9165683-0
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.640
And they're up above, turning a
wheel.

f4a7f0e6-5600-41cd-baad-32cdcb3512e5-0
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.810
{I can move on to the next
page.}

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-0
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:50.080
The bird has come back and it
has her marker in its beak and

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-1
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.845
she is like jumping for joy
inside of this cage. The cage

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-2
00:33:54.845 --> 00:33:59.527
doesn't really like. It's not
fully enclosed and there's

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-3
00:33:59.527 --> 00:34:04.784
definitely openings around this
cage. So she's really happy the

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-4
00:34:04.784 --> 00:34:10.123
bird has saved her now, like she
saved the bird. We're moving on

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-5
00:34:10.123 --> 00:34:15.462
to the next page and the bird is
on her shoulder. She's starting

bc06177a-f96e-4d67-aa7f-d47272795a62-6
00:34:15.462 --> 00:34:16.120
to draw.

e1404776-40dc-40e3-a64b-0b290ec14205-0
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.637
with the red marker. And then
the bird flies away. She's still

e1404776-40dc-40e3-a64b-0b290ec14205-1
00:34:19.637 --> 00:34:23.074
drawing. And now the bird comes
back and she's sitting next to

e1404776-40dc-40e3-a64b-0b290ec14205-2
00:34:23.074 --> 00:34:26.403
her and she's still drawing.
She's drawing some sort of like

e1404776-40dc-40e3-a64b-0b290ec14205-3
00:34:26.403 --> 00:34:28.040
a box, like a rectangle shape.

e1c5234c-5cd9-400e-a622-6e6d216230d2-0
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.090
{Move on to the next page.}

9f98920d-788a-4431-acb8-ef714163ce52-0
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.809
OK, so she was drawing like a
magic carpet. So now she's on a

9f98920d-788a-4431-acb8-ef714163ce52-1
00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:40.450
red magic flying carpet.

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-0
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.259
She's out of the cage. We can
still see the cage there. It's

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-1
00:34:45.259 --> 00:34:49.703
behind her. There's all kinds of
like pretty colors. I mean sort

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-2
00:34:49.703 --> 00:34:53.872
of like like Aladdin, you know,
kind of you would see in the

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-3
00:34:53.872 --> 00:34:58.316
movie. It's got like the oranges
and the purples and the red. So

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-4
00:34:58.316 --> 00:35:02.691
lots of pretty colors. You can
see she's like up in the sky and

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-5
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:07.066
lots of lots of clouds, purple
clouds surrounding her. We could

0634bd13-5bdd-4f1c-80a3-e906131ee3fa-6
00:35:07.066 --> 00:35:08.570
still see kind of the.

0200afaf-c8aa-4a22-983f-f7b370e865cb-0
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.690
Something below. A town or maybe
the train, I don't know.

0200afaf-c8aa-4a22-983f-f7b370e865cb-1
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.341
Something is there's like people
and stuff below her and the

0200afaf-c8aa-4a22-983f-f7b370e865cb-2
00:35:16.341 --> 00:35:19.872
purple bird is flying with her.
So there's the purple bird

0200afaf-c8aa-4a22-983f-f7b370e865cb-3
00:35:19.872 --> 00:35:23.702
flying ahead of her and then she
is right behind it with the on

0200afaf-c8aa-4a22-983f-f7b370e865cb-4
00:35:23.702 --> 00:35:24.600
the red carpet.

7c244a2a-e9c4-4d68-8594-38b34c44d87a-0
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.860
{Move on to the next.}

4505bc3e-1008-47be-b003-a19f0e78828c-0
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.685
And we see her just up in the
sky. It's really pretty. There's

4505bc3e-1008-47be-b003-a19f0e78828c-1
00:35:33.685 --> 00:35:35.410
lots of stars in the sky.

ee5ab5d7-9ba4-4620-8f2d-0303d20f8984-0
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:40.845
Again, the purple Bird is is in
front now. It's pretty far ahead

ee5ab5d7-9ba4-4620-8f2d-0303d20f8984-1
00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:44.665
of her and she's on the red
carpet flying in the sky and

ee5ab5d7-9ba4-4620-8f2d-0303d20f8984-2
00:35:44.665 --> 00:35:48.686
there's lots of stars in the
sky, beautiful colors. You can

ee5ab5d7-9ba4-4620-8f2d-0303d20f8984-3
00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:52.975
see kind of like some mountains
or something behind her as well

ee5ab5d7-9ba4-4620-8f2d-0303d20f8984-4
00:35:52.975 --> 00:35:55.120
as a building maybe that castle.

42b91696-7736-43a2-9d65-e00927df58a3-0
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.960
And like a kind of a crooked
palm tree.

7b27972b-da18-4f14-aff1-4dbe4c2d0c6f-0
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.750
{And move on to the next page.}

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-0
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.788
And she has landed with her red
carpet. She's down by this tree.

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-1
00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:13.881
There's a little tiny purple
door. She's still got her red

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-2
00:36:13.881 --> 00:36:18.321
marker. And the purple bird is
just standing next to the purple

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-3
00:36:18.321 --> 00:36:22.552
door. And she goes up to the
purple door. The bird is there,

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-4
00:36:22.552 --> 00:36:26.923
it's it's opening its wings, and
she's about to open the door.

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-5
00:36:26.923 --> 00:36:31.085
She opens the door and the bird
flies through, and then she

6284557e-356b-4b7f-afcd-7e6c59cbc25b-6
00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:32.750
crawls through the door.

2e676d10-9cb5-441c-8248-2a5d5088e5d3-0
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.210
{We can move on.}

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-0
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:42.385
And now, so she's crawling out
like it looks like a like a post

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-1
00:36:42.385 --> 00:36:47.119
post office mailbox. And there's
a boy and he has a purple

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-2
00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:52.093
marker. And he is like running
towards the bird with his arms

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-3
00:36:52.093 --> 00:36:57.389
wide open, like he wants to give
the bird a big hug. And he's got

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-4
00:36:57.389 --> 00:37:02.444
a purple marker. She's got a red
marker. And the bird flies to

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-5
00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:07.499
the boy. He's on his hands. The
boy, his other hand is lifting

19916c9c-5f9c-44ff-ba9d-423f54cad9da-6
00:37:07.499 --> 00:37:07.660
up

adea2b44-7676-4884-9d25-9cfe49f2d58f-0
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.129
The girl with the red marker and
then the girl with the red

adea2b44-7676-4884-9d25-9cfe49f2d58f-1
00:37:11.129 --> 00:37:14.405
marker is starting to draw a
circle, and the boy with the

adea2b44-7676-4884-9d25-9cfe49f2d58f-2
00:37:14.405 --> 00:37:18.021
purple marker has the bird and
he's drawing a purple circle. So

adea2b44-7676-4884-9d25-9cfe49f2d58f-3
00:37:18.021 --> 00:37:21.467
we've got a red circle and a
purple circle, and they're just

adea2b44-7676-4884-9d25-9cfe49f2d58f-4
00:37:21.467 --> 00:37:23.840
standing next to them and we can
move on.

975b53fe-19f3-47d9-9a6e-bfa9fb828189-0
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.026
And ohh they drew a little bike
and now they're they're riding

975b53fe-19f3-47d9-9a6e-bfa9fb828189-1
00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:35.327
off together. It's like a 2 seat

975b53fe-19f3-47d9-9a6e-bfa9fb828189-4
00:37:43.735 --> 00:37:47.319
markers and the bird is flying

f26a7f1e-1b3c-441d-b794-2313d7c6bd48-0
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.250
You can move on.

0e00c673-157a-4296-ab04-7c92e478fc14-0
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.350
That's it. That's cute.

58b16f11-2035-4281-8587-a838f5b42282-0
00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.190
Let me see.

63bfa3e9-5c66-4506-9f69-7c3c887352dd-0
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.200

a95071ea-9f37-4601-9e07-4502d8a66994-0
00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:06.980
OK, next we have a complex
scene.

1ef4471c-ae19-4599-8cbe-797a09af22d4-0
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:29.770
OK.

916d650e-2600-4eea-9a5e-b3c48d6bbda3-0
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.470
OK, can you see my screen?

c631a6c4-8213-41eb-b769-9ea61a769af9-0
00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:46.797
So this is just a complex scene,
so like last week, take 3 to 5

c631a6c4-8213-41eb-b769-9ea61a769af9-1
00:38:46.797 --> 00:38:49.160
minutes to describe what you
see.

53f35a2f-6f58-4bd4-ace7-0c7d0f781a56-0
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.240

f6f6503b-ecb1-42f4-a5a0-68d34e7127cf-1
00:39:00.578 --> 00:39:04.889
kinds of stuff in the sky. We've
got a plane, we've got like a

f6f6503b-ecb1-42f4-a5a0-68d34e7127cf-2
00:39:04.889 --> 00:39:06.190

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.138
Gosh, what are those planes
called that? I mean it's almost

57dfe896-a65a-4f22-8609-6d7173b14043-1
00:39:14.138 --> 00:39:18.510
like a kind of floats on the air
type plane we've got a like a.

cff57731-5d64-40b8-85bc-238b796bd350-0
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:25.710
Spaceship, also a rocket and
another plane.

9ed1b757-ffa6-49a5-869c-2d7e342bd87d-0
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.333
We've got a looks like a like a
hot air balloon down on the

9ed1b757-ffa6-49a5-869c-2d7e342bd87d-1
00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:34.310
ground. There's some planes on
the ground.

f2524425-59cc-4697-bb0d-403d9399dfb7-0
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.630
There's trucks on the ground, a
bus.

28d89651-6b15-4c2f-b81c-480b96df2e37-0
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.729
A fire truck and it's there's
people on the fire truck and

28d89651-6b15-4c2f-b81c-480b96df2e37-1
00:39:44.729 --> 00:39:45.170
there.

850aadb8-dc86-4339-9894-ccebf88d0fca-0
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.897
Um, they've got the hose and
they're squirting water at some

850aadb8-dc86-4339-9894-ccebf88d0fca-1
00:39:50.897 --> 00:39:55.694
other people. You have a plane
with people exiting the plane

850aadb8-dc86-4339-9894-ccebf88d0fca-2
00:39:55.694 --> 00:40:00.570
and and there's like a luggage
cart, couple luggage carts and

850aadb8-dc86-4339-9894-ccebf88d0fca-3
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.200
there's.

c3056dcf-0c8e-4a52-9a12-fc6591dbe5fa-0

Boxes and.

4785cc69-a197-474d-b237-410a572d9107-0
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:09.577
Cargo that must have just come
off the plane. There's people

4785cc69-a197-474d-b237-410a572d9107-1
00:40:09.577 --> 00:40:13.558
that seem to be working at the
plane and then people who just

4785cc69-a197-474d-b237-410a572d9107-2
00:40:13.558 --> 00:40:17.540
seem to be exiting like they
were just on the plane. There's.

7b341c48-a596-4ed1-bc15-86d1224802e0-0
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.615
It looks like that must be the
in. OK, so then on the bottom of

7b341c48-a596-4ed1-bc15-86d1224802e0-1
00:40:23.615 --> 00:40:27.577
the page is the inside of the
airport, so that's where they're

7b341c48-a596-4ed1-bc15-86d1224802e0-2
00:40:27.577 --> 00:40:31.288
walking to and some of the
people are inside. There's like

7b341c48-a596-4ed1-bc15-86d1224802e0-3
00:40:31.288 --> 00:40:35.125
a a luggage carousel inside.
There's people working behind a

7b341c48-a596-4ed1-bc15-86d1224802e0-4
00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:35.439
desk.

6add573d-fc2a-48de-adda-8dfbb4abeed3-0
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:43.262
There's there's a lot of people
inside kind of all doing their

6add573d-fc2a-48de-adda-8dfbb4abeed3-1
00:40:43.262 --> 00:40:48.592
own thing, and then there's an
upper deck to that. So some

6add573d-fc2a-48de-adda-8dfbb4abeed3-2
00:40:48.592 --> 00:40:54.104
people are standing outside. Up
on the upper deck, there's a

6add573d-fc2a-48de-adda-8dfbb4abeed3-3
00:40:54.104 --> 00:40:59.525
blue bus with a line of people
about to enter the blue bus.

6add573d-fc2a-48de-adda-8dfbb4abeed3-4
00:40:59.525 --> 00:41:00.790
There's a red.

Truck like a.

cadb5d9f-1ebd-4c49-be01-1550dde183b0-0
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:09.266
I don't know, maybe carrying
like gas or oil or something and

cadb5d9f-1ebd-4c49-be01-1550dde183b0-1
00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:10.350

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:16.122
A string or something behind it
attached to it, and then there's

83fb60ee-4616-4e33-865e-426f595df1f9-1
00:41:16.122 --> 00:41:16.240

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.520
A cart.

3526e2c2-3a9e-41e9-9f5d-c8add7d606e3-0
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.427
With luggage, like a person on a
person with a cart of luggage,

3526e2c2-3a9e-41e9-9f5d-c8add7d606e3-1
00:41:23.427 --> 00:41:27.466
but it's like attached to that
string. There's a green truck

3526e2c2-3a9e-41e9-9f5d-c8add7d606e3-2
00:41:27.466 --> 00:41:31.703
and some people that look like
they probably are working on the

3526e2c2-3a9e-41e9-9f5d-c8add7d606e3-3
00:41:31.703 --> 00:41:35.079

Several other planes.

25986273-045b-4aa3-9880-cf673c90aacd-0
00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.585
There's some people on the

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:49.029
fire truck probably maybe like
fell off the fire truck. There's

25986273-045b-4aa3-9880-cf673c90aacd-2
00:41:49.029 --> 00:41:52.640
a looks like an ace of spades on
one of the planes.

c5eef2dd-e35c-44bf-9368-ee53f5061583-0
00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:58.675
There's another plane and the
stairs have come off and so the

c5eef2dd-e35c-44bf-9368-ee53f5061583-1
00:41:58.675 --> 00:42:02.141
people are trying to exit and
they're just falling to the

c5eef2dd-e35c-44bf-9368-ee53f5061583-2
00:42:02.141 --> 00:42:04.890
ground as opposed to walking
down the stairs.

7cd6480d-a5a0-47ac-8390-62178e300f40-0
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.910

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.310
They're really small, but it
looks like maybe elephants.

5df5267b-f0fc-4133-a16a-b8b366f02bbf-0
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.600

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.175
There's scaffolding and stuff
behind it, and there's somebody

6d69b6f6-7fcb-461f-9a9f-d1f2cad53b8d-1
00:47:28.175 --> 00:47:32.130

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.502
And then over next to it, on the
other side, we've got like a

376dc937-1dbf-404c-93f1-f1f602662d99-1
00:47:46.502 --> 00:47:50.760
whole dinosaur area, so there's

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.087
Lava spewing out of it right
underneath them, and they're

6cb7496f-d29b-45d6-adc3-1e7bd8cdbb01-1

bunch of Cavemen over by the

6cb7496f-d29b-45d6-adc3-1e7bd8cdbb01-3
00:48:12.897 --> 00:48:16.360
dinosaurs. Some of them are
trying to climb up the volcano.

47f5ed2f-bfd1-424d-8853-661bea41accf-0
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.160
There's lights around it.

cf5ab59e-a43b-4854-887d-47969713d1bb-0
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:25.210

00:48:37.022 --> 00:48:38.270
there's people.

People and kind of like a line
and are not really in line, but

5f8b3013-f48a-429a-b043-9d267bd4f0c3-1
00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:49.310
they're just kind of all over in
line. And there's doors where

5f8b3013-f48a-429a-b043-9d267bd4f0c3-2
00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:53.243
they're going in, there's a
dinosaur going in the door and

5f8b3013-f48a-429a-b043-9d267bd4f0c3-3
00:48:53.243 --> 00:48:55.910
there's people dressed up like
mummies.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.925
And if you move over a little
further, there's another scene

bf0c091e-6514-47e0-8306-a2ae0d02806c-1
00:49:01.925 --> 00:49:02.830

Ghouls and goblins.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.466
It looks like ice cream in the
middle. I don't know exactly

3841d0ef-e858-4e00-8d22-b1c1646a2e80-1
00:49:21.466 --> 00:49:22.100
what that is.

bae8eeee-829a-4300-967b-3ecea5f4352a-0
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:29.035
And then if you go over a little
bit further, there's another

bae8eeee-829a-4300-967b-3ecea5f4352a-1
00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:30.240

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.732
Kind of looks like a diner. Um,
there's tables and there is a

5f2e94e6-a56b-4f66-9892-44cad184ffbf-1
00:49:36.732 --> 00:49:41.700

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.154
Maybe like several different
movies being filmed or something

17ecb057-6da6-48be-b9b9-40ad2e0c08ee-1
00:50:00.154 --> 00:50:01.750

00:51:58.740 --> 00:51:59.610
Picture.

61bede85-f2da-4b71-90c3-401c9e615a7f-0
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.296
That looks like a family
picture. It's three people. It

61bede85-f2da-4b71-90c3-401c9e615a7f-1
00:52:03.296 --> 00:52:05.330
looks like a man, woman and a
child.

4c3014f0-cb59-45e9-8de3-155088f76a54-0
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:10.133
And it's on a shelf and in the
next picture there's a hand

4c3014f0-cb59-45e9-8de3-155088f76a54-1
00:52:10.133 --> 00:52:14.579
that's taking the picture off
the shelf. The next picture they

4c3014f0-cb59-45e9-8de3-155088f76a54-2
00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:15.920
are wrapping it up.

bedd747e-9481-44eb-9cc6-5da222faee80-0
00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.651
Um, like they're going to send
it somewhere. So they're putting

bedd747e-9481-44eb-9cc6-5da222faee80-1
00:52:20.651 --> 00:52:24.643
it in some sort of like tissue
paper and then they're putting a

bedd747e-9481-44eb-9cc6-5da222faee80-2
00:52:24.643 --> 00:52:28.260
big bow around it and then
they're there with it with the

bedd747e-9481-44eb-9cc6-5da222faee80-3
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:28.509
bow.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:33.991
Can't really tell what's
happening in the next picture.

1e4c445d-167d-44b8-86cd-f3e1af8c6a81-1
00:52:33.991 --> 00:52:37.659
Maybe they put it in a box
because I don't see it anymore.

1e4c445d-167d-44b8-86cd-f3e1af8c6a81-2
00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:41.389
I don't see the tissue paper in
the bowl anymore, but their

1e4c445d-167d-44b8-86cd-f3e1af8c6a81-3
00:52:41.389 --> 00:52:43.999
hands are on something and then
they are.

d98b08b6-5bec-4350-8435-c867fcc41d44-0
00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:51.591
Looks like maybe they've got
like a belt around the box, so

d98b08b6-5bec-4350-8435-c867fcc41d44-1
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:55.310
they're like tightening it up
and making sure it's secure.

37751a1e-556a-4551-890d-79cc795fbf9b-0
00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.343
and just kind of messing with
the belts in the next couple

37751a1e-556a-4551-890d-79cc795fbf9b-1
00:53:01.343 --> 00:53:04.656
pictures. They just have like
their hand on the box and then

37751a1e-556a-4551-890d-79cc795fbf9b-2
00:53:04.656 --> 00:53:07.860
both hands on the box and we can
move on to the next page.

4a7c982a-5ed5-4680-acc4-f5c883ebf523-0
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:16.220
And now we see like an origami
bird.

348a3e20-bde5-4ef1-b665-1dec9cd319d9-0
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.646
And a clock and hat and
something hanging on the wall

348a3e20-bde5-4ef1-b665-1dec9cd319d9-1
00:53:20.646 --> 00:53:24.915
next. So they're both hanging on
the wall, the hat and something

348a3e20-bde5-4ef1-b665-1dec9cd319d9-2
00:53:24.915 --> 00:53:29.119
else like a towel or something
are hanging on the wall. Then we

348a3e20-bde5-4ef1-b665-1dec9cd319d9-3
00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:30.630
have a pot and a spoon.

7cdb197a-f8f2-41e9-aed7-6d80c9fa6cae-0
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:37.717
Drawing of a family, so it's
like a mom, dad and child and a

7cdb197a-f8f2-41e9-aed7-6d80c9fa6cae-1
00:53:37.717 --> 00:53:38.130
bird.

b06f7cc3-d0b5-4372-a95d-15365c1ba24a-0
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.160
And then there's a teapot.

885bdde4-e840-4484-a707-d3639738f5cc-0
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.590
There's a teacup.

3863b63c-c964-486e-95e7-81f2e64a47d6-0
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.340
With some papers next to it,
there's a.

8d52c4b7-012a-4ece-8c96-0a252f559995-0
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.450
Like a chest with.

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-0
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:56.616
Something inside of it, towels
maybe. It's hard to tell. And

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-1
00:53:56.616 --> 00:54:00.862
then there is that that family
again. So it's like the mom, dad

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-2
00:54:00.862 --> 00:54:04.776
and child in the picture. And
then on the next page we see

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-3
00:54:04.776 --> 00:54:08.623
everything together. So it's
like a scene of all of those

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-4
00:54:08.623 --> 00:54:12.471
items that I just named. So
there's the the man and woman

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-5
00:54:12.471 --> 00:54:16.517
that was just call them the mom
and the dad and they're in a

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-6
00:54:16.517 --> 00:54:20.763
kitchen. They've got the chest
on the table. There's the teapot

cc4866e5-8618-45bd-8675-05cf7e592344-7
00:54:20.763 --> 00:54:22.819
and the teacups along with the.

3e1cd069-e4c5-4de7-924e-2d902777094b-0
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:28.317
Papers on the table. The drawing
is in the background as well as

3e1cd069-e4c5-4de7-924e-2d902777094b-1
00:54:28.317 --> 00:54:33.398
the origami bird, the Hat, the
towel hanging on the wall, the

3e1cd069-e4c5-4de7-924e-2d902777094b-2
00:54:33.398 --> 00:54:33.890
clock.

88ec6c68-a569-4e28-ac00-baa2879a5b9c-0
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.984
The pot is in the background,
yeah. So everything that was

88ec6c68-a569-4e28-ac00-baa2879a5b9c-1
00:54:39.984 --> 00:54:43.100
just on that other page is now
altogether in this scene.

bced8ba8-6982-4a15-85fe-4c23c3deed39-0
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.460
{We can move on to the next
page.}

54256068-ba9d-4f85-89e8-938d35feeb6a-0
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:55.542
OK, and then we have a so bunch
of small pictures again. So

54256068-ba9d-4f85-89e8-938d35feeb6a-1
00:54:55.542 --> 00:55:00.696
we've got a child sleeping and
then they're like covered up and

54256068-ba9d-4f85-89e8-938d35feeb6a-2
00:55:00.696 --> 00:55:06.011
they're covers. They're starting
to wake up. And then on the next

54256068-ba9d-4f85-89e8-938d35feeb6a-3
00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:10.763
picture they're like sitting up
and rubbing their eyes and

54256068-ba9d-4f85-89e8-938d35feeb6a-4
00:55:10.763 --> 00:55:15.676
yawning and it looks like it's
probably a little girl. She's

54256068-ba9d-4f85-89e8-938d35feeb6a-5
00:55:15.676 --> 00:55:20.750
sitting at the table with her
bowl and spoon eating something.

967b358a-e5f5-4e7b-916f-2b131083e965-0
00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:24.550
And then she's still there in
the next picture and she's kind

967b358a-e5f5-4e7b-916f-2b131083e965-1
00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:27.310
of looking off to the side and
then we see a.

9d41e808-4eda-41cd-8ecc-9a2010deb3a9-0
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.310
Piece of luggage.

e6e45297-591b-480a-ba1b-19e4a2f045f6-0
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:35.123
A man is putting on a hat. The
woman is putting a scarf around

e6e45297-591b-480a-ba1b-19e4a2f045f6-1
00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:39.822
her head. The girl is putting a
coat and a hood on. She's

e6e45297-591b-480a-ba1b-19e4a2f045f6-2
00:55:39.822 --> 00:55:42.820
putting on boots. Now she's
sitting.

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-0
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:47.032
Uh, she's ohh, I'm sorry, she's
not sitting. She has the

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-1
00:55:47.032 --> 00:55:50.605
luggage, she's holding the
handle of the luggage and the

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-2
00:55:50.605 --> 00:55:54.492
man and the next picture. She's
kind of like reaching out his

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-3
00:55:54.492 --> 00:55:58.127
hand and then in the next
picture it's like a scene where

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-4
00:55:58.127 --> 00:56:01.888
they are outside, the three of
them. The man is holding the

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-5
00:56:01.888 --> 00:56:05.837
luggage and there's like a kind
of a creepy shadow on the wall

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-6
00:56:05.837 --> 00:56:09.661
behind them. So on the building
there's like a almost like a

6dd46303-f236-45e8-a210-172f247a456f-7
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:13.610
like a dragon tail or some sort
of shadow and it's like spiky.

07669ed4-6edb-4f1a-a78f-37e3d60aa9da-0
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.835
And it's on the wall. The wall
of the building that they're

07669ed4-6edb-4f1a-a78f-37e3d60aa9da-1
00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:17.510
walking past.

3b829c4d-ef67-4338-bb1f-f5cfbad27fa5-0
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.820
{move on to the next.}

71137c86-8f45-4c69-b670-f750e1d06be0-0
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.206
So we've got the little girl,
she's wearing a hat. She's

71137c86-8f45-4c69-b670-f750e1d06be0-1
00:56:27.206 --> 00:56:27.930
looking up.

a7489633-e2b1-4432-9112-c2c9e937c3b6-0
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.782
She's holding someone's hand and
she's looking down and she's

a7489633-e2b1-4432-9112-c2c9e937c3b6-1
00:56:32.782 --> 00:56:36.488
kinda looking off to the side.
And then the next picture,

a7489633-e2b1-4432-9112-c2c9e937c3b6-2
00:56:36.488 --> 00:56:40.450
there's a train coming, there's
a bunch of people waiting for

a7489633-e2b1-4432-9112-c2c9e937c3b6-3
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:41.090
the train.

c2e8b120-952c-4cd2-911b-baf5989b9983-0
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.960
And then she's.

6eb6da7f-e60b-4b6a-ae99-3c8e4919bf84-0
00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.444
There, it's probably her dad.
Somebody has their hand on her

6eb6da7f-e60b-4b6a-ae99-3c8e4919bf84-1
00:56:50.444 --> 00:56:54.624
shoulder. I'm guessing it's her
dad. And then the next picture,

6eb6da7f-e60b-4b6a-ae99-3c8e4919bf84-2
00:56:54.624 --> 00:56:58.543
her dad is taking off his hat
and there's the origami bird,

6eb6da7f-e60b-4b6a-ae99-3c8e4919bf84-3
00:56:58.543 --> 00:57:00.830
and he's holding the origami
bird.

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-0
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.369
And then he gives it to her.
She's holding it, and they're

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-1
00:57:05.369 --> 00:57:09.480
standing together and he's got
his arm around her, and now he's

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-2
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.398
giving her a hug. And now she's
holding the origami bird and

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-3
00:57:13.398 --> 00:57:17.315
looking off to the side. And
then the woman, let's just call

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-4
00:57:17.315 --> 00:57:21.169
her the mom, is crying and she
has a handkerchief and she's

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-5
00:57:21.169 --> 00:57:25.216
hugging the man. We'll just call
him the dad. They're hugging.

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-6
00:57:25.216 --> 00:57:28.812
And then he's whispering
something in her ear. And then

b5d3ce93-aac0-4309-a6d9-631a19ccdda4-7
00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.960
we see him with his luggage. It
looks like he's.

f5b26d16-78d6-4654-95f2-884cca4b10bd-0
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.228
Probably boarding the train and
all three of them are holding

f5b26d16-78d6-4654-95f2-884cca4b10bd-1
00:57:36.228 --> 00:57:40.619
hands and then you see like all
three hands, but they're let go.

f5b26d16-78d6-4654-95f2-884cca4b10bd-2
00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:44.875
And then we see the train with
the smoke coming out of it. The

f5b26d16-78d6-4654-95f2-884cca4b10bd-3
00:57:44.875 --> 00:57:49.063
train is pulling away and the
train has pulled away. {Move on

f5b26d16-78d6-4654-95f2-884cca4b10bd-4
00:57:49.063 --> 00:57:50.279
to the next page.}

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-0
00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.216
Now we see the photo of the
family, and then we see the

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-1
00:57:57.216 --> 00:58:01.760
photo is sitting on top of the
luggage and there's a bowl and a

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-2
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.807
spoon. And then in the next
picture you see it's the man

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-3
00:58:05.807 --> 00:58:10.352
with the he's eating something.
He's got the bowl and the spoon

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-4
00:58:10.352 --> 00:58:14.470
and he's looking at the family
photo. And then we see him

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-5
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:18.517
looking out like a, like a
little. Oh it's like a little

01291684-df2f-4879-ba51-9503bf37c1c3-6
00:58:18.517 --> 00:58:20.790
circular window, like in a ship.

c8d4f99f-0f80-4d85-ab68-c044e79e0391-0
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.064
So we can still see the scene,
but now we're seeing it like

c8d4f99f-0f80-4d85-ab68-c044e79e0391-1
00:58:25.064 --> 00:58:27.210
through the window and then
further away.

ba4fba7a-0538-49c0-bfe4-5754612c1dfb-0
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.870
Through the window and now we
see three little tiny windows.

ba4fba7a-0538-49c0-bfe4-5754612c1dfb-1
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:33.746
So we're just seeing the windows
of the ship, and then we see a

ba4fba7a-0538-49c0-bfe4-5754612c1dfb-2
00:58:33.746 --> 00:58:36.577
bunch of windows, and then we
see, we can see now that it is a

ba4fba7a-0538-49c0-bfe4-5754612c1dfb-3
00:58:36.577 --> 00:58:39.408
ship and there's a whole, we can
see a whole bunch of windows,

ba4fba7a-0538-49c0-bfe4-5754612c1dfb-4
00:58:39.408 --> 00:58:41.430
and now we just see the ship.
#END_arrival_1

cc0ee092-8624-4338-bbd8-986df0db22e7-0
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:45.530
We can move on and that's it.

c441b993-25c7-4e63-908f-b5eee9720212-0
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.019
OK, if you need a break, we
could take a 2 to 3 minute break

c441b993-25c7-4e63-908f-b5eee9720212-1
00:58:55.019 --> 00:58:58.220
right now. If not, whatever
works for you.

9ec8a073-dcc3-4cfa-b7a2-a2a349c79ef8-0
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:00.970
Yeah, we gotta take a couple
minute break, OK.

7057d751-8c51-4e7a-804b-a901b4b6e76d-0
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.460
All right. Thank you.

85776c8e-8193-4430-905c-2f2d7969f737-0
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.640
Next we have another short
story. I will.

2768f08e-ec39-4e1e-9b69-f6e18c209d38-0
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:17.150
Share my screen.

06e710eb-b202-42da-aabc-4584af6a68cc-0
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.370
OK.

fd367d80-9a7f-45fa-9124-c9abfadbac5d-0
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:24.870
OK.

1f9e4869-7255-4ab6-84eb-6479b8ecd301-0
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:31.865
#START_arrival_4 OK, so we start
out with a man. He is in the

1f9e4869-7255-4ab6-84eb-6479b8ecd301-1
00:59:31.865 --> 00:59:32.370
shower.

0ae23711-f238-4775-9ef0-43fc13236007-0
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.170
And then he's shaving.

8da24fa7-185e-438a-bfac-38bf5498a347-0
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:39.790
And he is putting on a vest.

0144b4d3-91e7-43d1-ba85-c9e8378506ac-0
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:45.131
So he's getting dressed in the
next scene In the next picture

0144b4d3-91e7-43d1-ba85-c9e8378506ac-1
00:59:45.131 --> 00:59:48.000
he is putting on his shoes and
then he has.

52e3255c-2d2e-4059-bccf-d35cef92962a-0
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:55.500
I think it's money in his hand
and he is putting on a hat.

9053d999-ce38-49bf-90db-58691b82e2df-0
00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:01.304
Uh, he's there's a map in the
next picture, and then he's

9053d999-ce38-49bf-90db-58691b82e2df-1
01:00:01.304 --> 01:00:06.728
holding the map, and now he is
outside and he's got some kind

9053d999-ce38-49bf-90db-58691b82e2df-2
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:10.140
of animal with him and he has
the map.

b01f2373-1bf1-434e-b606-b3b7d3176381-0
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:17.506
Next picture he's walking and
the animal is is following him

b01f2373-1bf1-434e-b606-b3b7d3176381-1
01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:19.080
and next picture.

ff7bceae-22d9-4260-9e90-8d6707c9af9a-0
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.309
Like a like a swirly Road.
There's a building, there's

ff7bceae-22d9-4260-9e90-8d6707c9af9a-1
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.950
clouds.

668d50dd-932e-4334-a683-18a9e7770740-0
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.500
Um.

3a58c5ac-78ff-48be-a695-cb2152bef0a3-0
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:32.410
Yeah, there's like a bunch of
buildings and then.

2729d140-8542-452c-95b2-d315887d1460-0
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:37.777
On the next page we see the map,
we see him looking at the map.

2729d140-8542-452c-95b2-d315887d1460-1
01:00:37.777 --> 01:00:42.284
I'm looking more intently at the
map, and there's the animal is

2729d140-8542-452c-95b2-d315887d1460-2
01:00:42.284 --> 01:00:46.509
there with him. And then on the
next picture he's standing.

812c1018-157c-468b-8a39-24d0f5fe1389-0
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:50.831
And I'm like, I don't know,
maybe it's like a platform or

812c1018-157c-468b-8a39-24d0f5fe1389-1
01:00:50.831 --> 01:00:53.010
something, just a bunch of
people around and there's like.

e58c3c91-91dc-466e-b545-762d6055bd2d-0
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.610
teepee looking things behind him
and.

73134c6e-fe20-457c-aed0-43b78237781c-0
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:04.999
Kind of looks like there's like
ships in the air behind him and

73134c6e-fe20-457c-aed0-43b78237781c-1
01:01:04.999 --> 01:01:06.030
like a bridge.

a73acbd8-6772-4afb-a9b0-80a2c877f0e4-0
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.676
And there's people in animals on
this platform. {We'll go to the

a73acbd8-6772-4afb-a9b0-80a2c877f0e4-1
01:01:12.676 --> 01:01:13.350
next page.}

4db0d9d5-0552-4818-91b1-09e933029a26-0
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:20.881
OK, so we see that animal is
standing with another animal. So

4db0d9d5-0552-4818-91b1-09e933029a26-1
01:01:20.881 --> 01:01:24.828
I don't know what it is. It's
got like a big long curly tail

4db0d9d5-0552-4818-91b1-09e933029a26-2
01:01:24.828 --> 01:01:28.775
and then whatever it's standing
with has like two big pointy

4db0d9d5-0552-4818-91b1-09e933029a26-3
01:01:28.775 --> 01:01:31.040
ears and then in the next
picture.

5c6042fe-e015-4470-be5c-9df2361d6118-0
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.920
He is.

6bbc6ce1-35fd-4631-9d99-846c4f55c981-0
01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.933
It's it's him and a woman, and
the two animals are behind them

6bbc6ce1-35fd-4631-9d99-846c4f55c981-1
01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:39.832
and they're they're not
together. But like he's looking,

6bbc6ce1-35fd-4631-9d99-846c4f55c981-2
01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:42.883
he's kind of he's got his map
out in front of him, but he's

6bbc6ce1-35fd-4631-9d99-846c4f55c981-3
01:01:42.883 --> 01:01:45.679
looking over at the woman and
she's looking at a book.

70a5ccd1-54db-4e9f-9fc3-e22a5fb3dcc7-0
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.418
And now in the next picture,
he's approached her, he's asking

70a5ccd1-54db-4e9f-9fc3-e22a5fb3dcc7-1
01:01:50.418 --> 01:01:54.372
her, it looks like he's asking
her a question, and now she's

70a5ccd1-54db-4e9f-9fc3-e22a5fb3dcc7-2
01:01:54.372 --> 01:01:58.131
pointing at something on the
map, and the next picture is

70a5ccd1-54db-4e9f-9fc3-e22a5fb3dcc7-3
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:02.020
just the map with them pointing
and then she's pointing at.

a305b78e-3d7d-4d6c-8061-c5932aeb0eb4-0
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:09.796
I guess it must be like a old
timey telephone and they're

a305b78e-3d7d-4d6c-8061-c5932aeb0eb4-1
01:02:09.796 --> 01:02:11.270
doing the dial.

b008bf00-ed21-4a76-b624-84b7eb58ad44-0
01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:17.066
Whatever you call it with the
like circle dial and then

b008bf00-ed21-4a76-b624-84b7eb58ad44-1
01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:20.100
there's a handle and they're
trying to.

90343087-b517-4628-880d-79a169dd4a6d-0
01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:26.260
Use the handle and then there's
a.

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-0
01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:33.436
I don't know what that is. It's
like, it's like a shoot or

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-1
01:02:33.436 --> 01:02:36.593
something. And something's
coming out of the shoot and

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-2
01:02:36.593 --> 01:02:40.209
they're holding their hand out
to get whatever it is. And then

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-3
01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:43.481
the woman is showing him
whatever it is and maybe like a

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-4
01:02:43.481 --> 01:02:47.040
boarding pass or something. It
looks like a ticket, like some

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-5
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.828
sort of a ticket. And then she's
handing him the, let's just call

f8b0b017-161e-41d4-9f34-60401b8c204a-6
01:02:50.828 --> 01:02:54.330
it the ticket, and then they're
talking in the next picture.

7455b0b1-7f0e-42c4-978a-accc717fdfd5-0
01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:59.687
She's holding up three fingers
and oh, it looks like she's got

7455b0b1-7f0e-42c4-978a-accc717fdfd5-1
01:02:59.687 --> 01:03:00.140
like a.

d4290f0f-b003-456d-875d-92f8abc9a67c-0
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.430
What are those clocks called?

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-0
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:11.100
I can't think of the name of it,
but it's like the the pocket

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-1
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.931
pocket watch. And then in the
next picture they're looking at

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-2
01:03:14.931 --> 01:03:18.886
these like flying ship things.
So there's like a whole bunch of

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-3
01:03:18.886 --> 01:03:22.223
people and they're kind of
looking up and pointing at

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-4
01:03:22.223 --> 01:03:25.992
these, like, flying ships in the
sky. And the flying ship is

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-5
01:03:25.992 --> 01:03:29.390
coming there. The flying ship
has arrived. They're all

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-6
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:33.036
standing outside of the flying
ship. It looks like they're

d9d37afb-f014-40cf-906a-afd71bfa9126-7
01:03:33.036 --> 01:03:36.620
probably about to board it. He's
got his animal with him.

52607f28-855d-4dc3-b65d-8f2d24a2d428-0
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:41.418
And then he's giving them a must
be a ticket and they're punching

52607f28-855d-4dc3-b65d-8f2d24a2d428-1
01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:45.859
the ticket. And the conductor
whoever took it is like telling

52607f28-855d-4dc3-b65d-8f2d24a2d428-2
01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:50.230
him where to go, like kind of
motioning off to go over here.

202bcf6e-d08c-4751-83f9-6748d3a8553a-0
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:52.570
{Back to the next page.}

72068968-310c-44d0-bfc9-230fc19062f6-0
01:03:56.010 --> 01:04:00.646
And he's sitting on a bench with
his animal, and now he's sitting

72068968-310c-44d0-bfc9-230fc19062f6-1
01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:01.770
next to a woman.

7ac0573a-e66d-4c0e-964d-6b995beeba97-0
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:03.350
Umm.

107e4bdd-5d02-4dc9-9fa0-0aa37ff07ff3-0
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:08.249
It must be the same woman, and
she's got that same animal with

107e4bdd-5d02-4dc9-9fa0-0aa37ff07ff3-1
01:04:08.249 --> 01:04:12.106
the pointy ears and there's
they're talking. She's got the

107e4bdd-5d02-4dc9-9fa0-0aa37ff07ff3-2
01:04:12.106 --> 01:04:15.768
little animal in her lap and
he's talking. He's pulling

107e4bdd-5d02-4dc9-9fa0-0aa37ff07ff3-3
01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:18.580
something out of his inner
jacket pockets.

9d804bb6-a9c1-4e71-91c1-ef3c2a4b831c-0
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.470
A piece of paper and she's.

d6039456-90d4-4fe1-9f59-8d5235e57d1d-0
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:31.325
Like holding her chest, um, and
looking at it, and then she's

d6039456-90d4-4fe1-9f59-8d5235e57d1d-1
01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:33.560
pulling something out of her
bag.

7d1ea429-13b4-416f-a733-5667de60ea3d-0
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.430
And it's a piece of paper and it
looks like it's a.

8304b72b-63f7-4feb-86b6-969441d8b34c-0
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:42.352
I know something from older
times, but it's like a picture

8304b72b-63f7-4feb-86b6-969441d8b34c-1
01:04:42.352 --> 01:04:44.880
of her on it, so I don't know if
it's like a.

819012ea-e8c2-4c82-b138-5bf32f55f42f-0
01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:50.155
Documentation showing who she is
and maybe that's what he had as

819012ea-e8c2-4c82-b138-5bf32f55f42f-1
01:04:50.155 --> 01:04:53.372
well because his has some sort
of a picture on it also, or

819012ea-e8c2-4c82-b138-5bf32f55f42f-2
01:04:53.372 --> 01:04:56.917
passport because there's stamps
on it. So maybe that's like what

819012ea-e8c2-4c82-b138-5bf32f55f42f-3
01:04:56.917 --> 01:05:00.244
passports used to look like, I
don't know. And then it looks

819012ea-e8c2-4c82-b138-5bf32f55f42f-4
01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.990
like the picture is like of her.

3d168b76-fb57-4bcb-8ace-04cdd2d2ac5f-0
01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:08.060
As a child. And then on the next
page, it's she's reading a book.

10343bc0-9ef2-4b23-b3a3-b7b204281fad-0
01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:10.750
And somebody is.

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-0
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.740
Coming up to her and they're
they, they want to take the book

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-1
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.137
away. She's horrified. And then
they're putting the book into a

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-2
01:05:20.137 --> 01:05:24.466
drawer and they're locking the
drawer, and now they're handing

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-3
01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:28.933
her a shovel, and she's walking
really sadly with the shovel. It

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-4
01:05:28.933 --> 01:05:32.712
doesn't look it's a good
situation and she's shoveling

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-5
01:05:32.712 --> 01:05:37.109
like coal or something into it.
Looks like maybe a furnace. And

8b31e357-01a8-441f-a6d2-a217ca6808f9-6
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:41.370
she's shoveling. Shoveling. It's
like spewing stuff back out.

54e63f8f-474d-4593-a771-461fc0a15cb2-0
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.944
To her, and now she's got like a
chimney sweep and she's up on a

54e63f8f-474d-4593-a771-461fc0a15cb2-1
01:05:45.944 --> 01:05:50.380
ladder and she's like cleaning
out the chimney of this furnace.

55735ba5-fd7e-48cb-af8f-07c87f04739c-0
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.090
{Watch the next page.}

fdcf5a48-3367-4bc1-adc8-424226f172fc-0
01:05:56.810 --> 01:06:02.230
I'm guessing she's like telling
the story of maybe what happened

fdcf5a48-3367-4bc1-adc8-424226f172fc-1
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:07.483
to her as a child and then she
is in a big room with all kinds

fdcf5a48-3367-4bc1-adc8-424226f172fc-2
01:06:07.483 --> 01:06:11.570
of chimneys and she appears to
be cleaning them.

d193c26d-4789-4b0f-b67f-cafa9b8ff4f2-0
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.343
Now she's sitting on the floor
and she looks like she's

d193c26d-4789-4b0f-b67f-cafa9b8ff4f2-1
01:06:17.343 --> 01:06:21.943
probably crying. She's upset.
Now she's back with the shovel

d193c26d-4789-4b0f-b67f-cafa9b8ff4f2-2
01:06:21.943 --> 01:06:25.790
and now she's trying to open a
door with a shovel.

4672abb4-7e49-4792-96a5-6e7d1e62bcfd-0
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:31.092
And then she's kind of like
peeking and looking behind her.

4672abb4-7e49-4792-96a5-6e7d1e62bcfd-1
01:06:31.092 --> 01:06:35.807
She's opening the drawer. She
found her book. She she grabbed

4672abb4-7e49-4792-96a5-6e7d1e62bcfd-2
01:06:35.807 --> 01:06:40.826
her book and it looks like she's
escaping and I don't know what's

4672abb4-7e49-4792-96a5-6e7d1e62bcfd-3
01:06:40.826 --> 01:06:45.845
in that middle picture. And then
she's like climbing out a window

4672abb4-7e49-4792-96a5-6e7d1e62bcfd-4
01:06:45.845 --> 01:06:50.484
and she's hiding and she's got
her book and she is. And then

4672abb4-7e49-4792-96a5-6e7d1e62bcfd-5
01:06:50.484 --> 01:06:53.830
the next picture is a picture of
the train.

38bb3e60-0615-49f2-8e26-b172ebfd76ff-0
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:56.960
{To move on.}

98e7004d-898d-4b52-a413-077e4608def2-0
01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.260
And OK, now we're back to the
the ship in the sky.

405a86be-273c-424e-95c5-3083b336f4b8-0
01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.690
And.

11db3d9e-d8e3-4649-acf0-084fc5f17422-0
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:10.729
She's pointing at that. So it's
the man and the woman again.

11db3d9e-d8e3-4649-acf0-084fc5f17422-1
01:07:10.729 --> 01:07:14.769
She's got the pointy eared
animal in her lap and she's

11db3d9e-d8e3-4649-acf0-084fc5f17422-2
01:07:14.769 --> 01:07:18.881
pointing at something and
someone is talking into a big

11db3d9e-d8e3-4649-acf0-084fc5f17422-3
01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:23.434
megaphone, like a conductor or
somebody, and now they're out.

11db3d9e-d8e3-4649-acf0-084fc5f17422-4
01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:26.960
Now the people are outside and
they're looking.

84e22ee8-56ae-415e-9c80-e18394af721e-0
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.960
They're looking up at.

9dd16046-f0f0-422a-9e63-b5172470365d-0
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:35.544
Probably it must be the ship.
And then he's looks like he's

9dd16046-f0f0-422a-9e63-b5172470365d-1
01:07:35.544 --> 01:07:39.424
saying goodbye, like he's
shaking her hand and he and his

9dd16046-f0f0-422a-9e63-b5172470365d-2
01:07:39.424 --> 01:07:43.371
animal are walking away. And
then he's got his hand on his

9dd16046-f0f0-422a-9e63-b5172470365d-3
01:07:43.371 --> 01:07:47.586
chin like he's thinking about
something and he's looking up to

9dd16046-f0f0-422a-9e63-b5172470365d-4
01:07:47.586 --> 01:07:49.460
the sky. And then now he is.

bf2bbd4d-d034-49cb-bae6-11f0ac59fe5e-0
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:51.700
Now he's like.

59484bed-89d4-4c55-a1bb-5e3259206d82-0
01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:58.546
Outside and he's looking at like
a statue that looks like his

59484bed-89d4-4c55-a1bb-5e3259206d82-1
01:07:58.546 --> 01:07:59.130
animal.

3e7cd309-e0d7-4348-93bf-b470f6f618f5-0
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:04.082
And there's some other people
there, and that's kind of like a

3e7cd309-e0d7-4348-93bf-b470f6f618f5-1
01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:07.203
weird looking city. But yeah,
he's just kind of looking at

3e7cd309-e0d7-4348-93bf-b470f6f618f5-2
01:08:07.203 --> 01:08:10.271
the, I'm guessing it must be a
statue of like a big giant

3e7cd309-e0d7-4348-93bf-b470f6f618f5-3
01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:13.340
thing, and it looks a lot like
the animal that he's with.

1f592263-606b-4025-8f73-b37d3c5d4360-0
01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:17.820
{I can move on to the next.}

f95402f4-55eb-4166-9f48-3690ca8b2918-0
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.112
And now he's walking with the
animal. Then he there's about a

f95402f4-55eb-4166-9f48-3690ca8b2918-1
01:08:24.112 --> 01:08:26.650
whole bunch of people now
there's like.

53bfe730-9706-46b2-84d7-ab7b34ba8900-0
01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:29.410
a bunch of tails.

ac468bf1-52f8-41e4-8338-ea58a65b8283-0
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:35.640
And two people talking to each
other and then we see.

29eda9cd-e0de-4be0-9936-a3a829a09f6b-0
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:40.812
Looks like a woman with a hat
and a scarf and gloves and

29eda9cd-e0de-4be0-9936-a3a829a09f6b-1
01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:41.240
she's.

b73e7f16-b1ae-403d-8547-210877ad2a4b-0
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.610
She's got her hand on something.

7bfc8b79-8976-4653-b810-46a11286c71e-0
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.680
And then there's.

970e074b-7d23-4c8c-9a27-6ed460012688-0
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:54.885
An older man and another person
with a hood and they're they've

970e074b-7d23-4c8c-9a27-6ed460012688-1
01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:56.940
got like an animal in a box.

466b699d-5abc-441d-8764-f494cf0bb812-0
01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:01.184
And then we see him with his
animal and just kind of in the

466b699d-5abc-441d-8764-f494cf0bb812-1
01:09:01.184 --> 01:09:04.849
middle of the street with a
bunch of people and that they're

466b699d-5abc-441d-8764-f494cf0bb812-2
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:08.514
looking at it. There's a book
just pointing at the book, and

466b699d-5abc-441d-8764-f494cf0bb812-3
01:09:08.514 --> 01:09:12.118
then he's kind of looking off to
the animal. So on the wall

466b699d-5abc-441d-8764-f494cf0bb812-4
01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:12.900
there's like.

bc9ce4b2-3783-4b9f-a7b6-ef45daade0d5-0
01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:18.221
Hieroglyphic type stuff. And the
animal is like pointing at

bc9ce4b2-3783-4b9f-a7b6-ef45daade0d5-1
01:09:18.221 --> 01:09:21.870
something, trying to show him
something and he.

859c4d78-f4ad-4ce0-8431-2c2d0cccde3a-0
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:27.652
It looks like it's a drawer, so
it's like a drawer on the wall.

859c4d78-f4ad-4ce0-8431-2c2d0cccde3a-1
01:09:27.652 --> 01:09:28.960
He opens the drawer.

26948128-c30e-44f3-acab-aa97564d5baf-0
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.334
there are some some things
inside with tails. And then he

26948128-c30e-44f3-acab-aa97564d5baf-1
01:09:34.334 --> 01:09:38.787
looks back at his book and then
goes back to the drawer. The

26948128-c30e-44f3-acab-aa97564d5baf-2
01:09:38.787 --> 01:09:43.240
drawer is open. There's like
three things with tails inside.

26948128-c30e-44f3-acab-aa97564d5baf-3
01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.058
And somebody's got their hand on
one of them. And now he's with a

26948128-c30e-44f3-acab-aa97564d5baf-4
01:09:48.058 --> 01:09:52.584
child. And the child has this,
the thing with the tail in his

26948128-c30e-44f3-acab-aa97564d5baf-5
01:09:52.584 --> 01:09:55.139
hand, and it kind of looks like
a.

dbb25ec0-3bfb-46ad-b169-833e318d0236-0
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.450
like a

54396097-8221-4b81-be75-d8767405456b-0
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:59.450
See animal like some sort of.

8bfdf4f9-6f88-4528-83d9-2d459e829888-0
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:04.652
Amphibian or something, but the
kid's hold it's not in water, so

8bfdf4f9-6f88-4528-83d9-2d459e829888-1
01:10:04.652 --> 01:10:08.869
I don't know exactly what it is.
And then the next picture is a

8bfdf4f9-6f88-4528-83d9-2d459e829888-2
01:10:08.869 --> 01:10:12.558
different man with that same
child and he's holding the

8bfdf4f9-6f88-4528-83d9-2d459e829888-3
01:10:12.558 --> 01:10:14.140
amphibian looking thing.

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-0
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:19.670
And now our original man that
we've been following throughout

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-1
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:23.487
the story, he's kind of like,
no, no, no, I don't want that.

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-2
01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:27.430
He's showing them the book. He's
showing them a picture in the

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-3
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:31.497
book. And I'm like, hey, I want
this. And then he's like talking

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-4
01:10:31.497 --> 01:10:35.565
about the book. He's like giving
him more details. And the other

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-5
01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:39.570
man is pointing at something on
the wall. He opens the wall, he

c8102bdd-587e-4a22-bab5-9fed8c70dfdc-6
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:41.009
finds something inside.

02bc6a4e-1a9b-4066-93fa-8dfdea5e09cb-0
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.160
Umm.

1e1acaa3-0a67-4f94-9d01-3cba589a3948-0
01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:50.399
I don't know what it is. It's
like it's like a shell or

1e1acaa3-0a67-4f94-9d01-3cba589a3948-1
01:10:50.399 --> 01:10:54.034
something. And then they're
talking. The little boy has a

1e1acaa3-0a67-4f94-9d01-3cba589a3948-2
01:10:54.034 --> 01:10:58.045
big basket. He's holding a big
basket, and then the two men are

1e1acaa3-0a67-4f94-9d01-3cba589a3948-3
01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.680
talking. The basket is there and
the little boy is there.

23c270db-5236-4683-9ecb-f756ab4ae9ef-0
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.030
{I can move on to the next.}

3fd8561e-73af-40c3-bc2a-a0a403a5c650-0
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.810
OK, so the 2nd man is holding.

83876ab2-1d54-40bf-82a9-f8b8995a2b57-0
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:14.960
Looks like a giant shrimp.

326e364a-6400-43c0-a967-0634e9d8b64d-0
01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:17.770
And then the little boy is
holding.

4e1bbb77-5aaf-4455-ac16-425df5daea70-0
01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.700
Something.

bbaa8caf-7b77-423a-9245-0844aebf94fa-0
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:27.470
It's got like bubbles coming out
of it, and then the man is.

011fd99f-d339-4265-a466-8d5a3430b007-0
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:32.028
he's got his hand to his lips.
I'm guessing he's eating

011fd99f-d339-4265-a466-8d5a3430b007-1
01:11:32.028 --> 01:11:35.491
something and then the little
boy is holding something else.

011fd99f-d339-4265-a466-8d5a3430b007-2
01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:36.400

fa6fdfc0-d69f-46db-8efb-da4ac2c08849-0
01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.180
It looks like a giant acorn, but
it's like huge. And then.

4654063d-345b-47f0-9979-fc6b954c0978-0
01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.470
Somebody's hands are around.

36fdb7c1-a423-4d32-bb81-4804daaae6ce-0
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.640
Something with like 4 tails.

6c9cc03a-e648-423a-8f74-f43fdc1f6a30-0
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.247
And then the man, this is his
second man, he's got like a big

6c9cc03a-e648-423a-8f74-f43fdc1f6a30-1
01:11:54.247 --> 01:11:58.135
snake in his hands. And then
that second man has some sort of

6c9cc03a-e648-423a-8f74-f43fdc1f6a30-2
01:11:58.135 --> 01:12:02.086
like fish looking thing in his
hands and he's given the thumbs

6c9cc03a-e648-423a-8f74-f43fdc1f6a30-3
01:12:02.086 --> 01:12:05.848
up. And then he's got something
else kind of small. I can't

6c9cc03a-e648-423a-8f74-f43fdc1f6a30-4
01:12:05.848 --> 01:12:09.799
really see exactly what it is in
his hands and he's holding it

6c9cc03a-e648-423a-8f74-f43fdc1f6a30-5
01:12:09.799 --> 01:12:10.050
out.

2f5bf107-5f79-4783-9641-9ca1de16da47-0
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:15.398
And then the little boy has that
amphibian looking thing and he's

2f5bf107-5f79-4783-9641-9ca1de16da47-1
01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:19.090
like putting it up to his mouth
like he's going to eat it.

3a5c661e-f85f-445c-9dec-8b9b27fd01bb-0
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.340
And then the original man is
back and he's holding something.

b81bf1ef-1bd3-4439-b80e-e5fbe984729a-0
01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:29.719
And the little boy is about to
feed the animals, the the man's

b81bf1ef-1bd3-4439-b80e-e5fbe984729a-1
01:12:29.719 --> 01:12:34.331
animal and then there's a basket
and so that's that basket that

b81bf1ef-1bd3-4439-b80e-e5fbe984729a-2
01:12:34.331 --> 01:12:37.070
the boy was holding in the last
page.

bd188369-0879-4b9d-873f-1bd8497b9f25-0
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:42.371
And there's just a bunch of
stuff in it. And then the little

bd188369-0879-4b9d-873f-1bd8497b9f25-1
01:12:42.371 --> 01:12:45.330
boy is talking to the second
man. He's like whispering

bd188369-0879-4b9d-873f-1bd8497b9f25-2
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.459
something in his ear.

886668e0-d76d-4a95-960b-9bb0b7446925-0
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:51.003
2nd Man has his arm around the
first man and now they each have

886668e0-d76d-4a95-960b-9bb0b7446925-1
01:12:51.003 --> 01:12:54.616
their own basket of stuff. The
little boy has a basket and he's

886668e0-d76d-4a95-960b-9bb0b7446925-2

they're just kind of standing

18e32656-72c6-4a4b-9c2e-605c930349ec-3

c2d60985-6187-4b83-b746-ebacf13a8377-0
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:12.200
{I can move on.}

3fadf8dc-55f6-4f41-881e-589da5374df0-0
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:20.160
OK, so the little boy has a
basket and he's got so the

3fadf8dc-55f6-4f41-881e-589da5374df0-1

The little boy has like a.

95324f60-8fbd-45e6-af27-542ef1746063-0
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:32.665
Like a cauldron looking thing
now, and there's a tail coming

95324f60-8fbd-45e6-af27-542ef1746063-1
01:13:32.665 --> 01:13:36.677

01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:40.754
looking at the tail, and now the
tail is getting bigger and the

95324f60-8fbd-45e6-af27-542ef1746063-3
01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:44.702
original man drops his basket
and the little boy just kind of

95324f60-8fbd-45e6-af27-542ef1746063-4
01:13:44.702 --> 01:13:46.549
puts his hand over his mouth.

39e54786-9d57-47d8-90a7-508de15e2d60-0
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:52.925
The two men are standing
together and now they're looking

39e54786-9d57-47d8-90a7-508de15e2d60-1
01:13:52.925 --> 01:13:55.040

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:59.360
It looks like the thing with the
tail came out and it's like a.

1bf76497-cf31-4065-9a4e-5a355148b273-0
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:04.273
Gosh, these don't look like
really animals. It's like an owl

1bf76497-cf31-4065-9a4e-5a355148b273-1
01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.820
looking thing and he's holding
it and.

0728871b-1e90-48bb-a82c-83043a5da87f-0
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:12.749
There's the owl looking thing
and then the man is standing

0728871b-1e90-48bb-a82c-83043a5da87f-1
01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:17.178

01:14:17.178 --> 01:14:21.470
now that so it's like an owl,
but it's not an owl because it's

0728871b-1e90-48bb-a82c-83043a5da87f-3
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:25.422
like standing on its feet. So
it's kind of like a cat owl

0728871b-1e90-48bb-a82c-83043a5da87f-4
01:14:25.422 --> 01:14:29.170
combo and it's standing with the
man's animal and now.

e62adaaa-f2f1-4ec2-9ad3-5fd42fe1e260-0
01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:33.960
They're kind of standing next to
each other, hanging out and

e62adaaa-f2f1-4ec2-9ad3-5fd42fe1e260-1
01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.300
then.

ff0330ba-f722-4b68-859a-2fd5949f75a9-0
01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.083
We just see some hands and then
we see the two men talking

ff0330ba-f722-4b68-859a-2fd5949f75a9-1
01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:43.389
together. We see our original
man and he's just kind of like

ff0330ba-f722-4b68-859a-2fd5949f75a9-2
01:14:43.389 --> 01:14:47.976
holding his hands up, like he's
asking a question. And then he's

ff0330ba-f722-4b68-859a-2fd5949f75a9-3
01:14:47.976 --> 01:14:52.422
writing something in a book and
we see him. We see him drawing

ff0330ba-f722-4b68-859a-2fd5949f75a9-4
01:14:52.422 --> 01:14:56.798

the other man what he drew. And
then the other man has his hands

ff0330ba-f722-4b68-859a-2fd5949f75a9-6
01:15:01.385 --> 01:15:01.880

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.715
He's looking up at the sky and
his hands are open and then he's

78e59ee8-9bfe-42d4-a0b8-7817bc93fc79-1
01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:15.450
just looking up and now we just
see his eyeball. #END_arrival_4

71688ed2-f54d-476c-b904-6b2bd1257cb9-0
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.650
We can move on.

dc59968d-afed-4cfa-b956-b287fe2b2485-0

dd2cd069-edea-4976-afb9-a89ac1d29829-0

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.770
#START_being_a_pirate We've got
a whole bunch of pirate ships.

3d503873-eceb-4540-88f1-7726be3673c9-0
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.908

And there's people all the way
up to the top by the flag, and

cc846192-7064-4097-b5b5-eff4a8809a0a-1

sails would be, but the sails
are not open. And let's see,

cc846192-7064-4097-b5b5-eff4a8809a0a-3
01:17:02.153 --> 01:17:07.352

the water.

188df4ab-0ce9-4707-9f13-16fd4c716ef7-0
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:13.170
There's another boat that has
three pirate flags.

9b205c9a-abac-42b3-a6fa-d42523413a4d-0
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:14.830
Umm.

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:29.944

565f2160-089c-4214-a7a9-edbc60d64ab8-1
01:21:15.732 --> 01:21:17.950

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.676
And he's holding something. So
he's all dressed in like orange,

25778fb1-bf84-4b18-ae30-7aef88633b38-1
01:21:23.676 --> 01:21:27.257

on it, all in different colors.

25778fb1-bf84-4b18-ae30-7aef88633b38-4
01:21:34.303 --> 01:21:37.884
And he looks like he's got an
orange marker, and he's showing

25778fb1-bf84-4b18-ae30-7aef88633b38-5
01:21:37.884 --> 01:21:41.349

look really scared. So the one

25778fb1-bf84-4b18-ae30-7aef88633b38-6
01:21:41.349 --> 01:21:44.757
the girl is down on the ground
and the boy looks like he's

25778fb1-bf84-4b18-ae30-7aef88633b38-7
01:21:44.757 --> 01:21:48.049
about to fall over. They both
have their markers and the

25778fb1-bf84-4b18-ae30-7aef88633b38-8
01:21:48.049 --> 01:21:49.839
purple bird is there with them.

f7cf460e-0e4d-4f98-9b73-d1d2f18a5f57-0
01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:54.065
And now the king is standing
with them. They don't look

f7cf460e-0e4d-4f98-9b73-d1d2f18a5f57-1
01:21:54.065 --> 01:21:58.193
scared anymore. They're all
standing together. The purple

f7cf460e-0e4d-4f98-9b73-d1d2f18a5f57-2
01:21:58.193 --> 01:22:02.605
birds on the boy's shoulder and
the little boy is holding the

f7cf460e-0e4d-4f98-9b73-d1d2f18a5f57-3
01:22:02.605 --> 01:22:07.160
piece of paper, kind of like a
scroll type thing, but the king.

73e6935c-c582-464b-9317-61a146f3cfbf-0
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.428
Had in the last picture and the
king is just pointing to

73e6935c-c582-464b-9317-61a146f3cfbf-1
01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:16.338
something on the page. The king
is still standing in the doorway

73e6935c-c582-464b-9317-61a146f3cfbf-2
01:22:16.338 --> 01:22:19.766
and the door is open and now
there are two guard looking

73e6935c-c582-464b-9317-61a146f3cfbf-3
01:22:19.766 --> 01:22:23.135

grabbed onto the king and are

73e6935c-c582-464b-9317-61a146f3cfbf-4
01:22:23.135 --> 01:22:26.864
like taking him back into the
place and he doesn't look happy

73e6935c-c582-464b-9317-61a146f3cfbf-5
01:22:26.864 --> 01:22:28.969

like.

548b6962-64c8-410e-bc68-6e62ee64b387-0
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:32.150
Probably not good.

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-0
01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:36.051
Doing good things. So he
dropped. He's dropping his

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-1
01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:39.991
orange marker. They're dragging
him back into the doorway. The

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-2
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:43.743
kids are still there. They look
kind of scared. The bird is

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-3
01:22:43.743 --> 01:22:47.558

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-5
01:22:51.498 --> 01:22:55.125
him to go. Like, you know,
they're going to go inside and

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-6
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:59.002
they're going to make sure he
stays inside the orange markers

f716d309-3884-4080-a265-c75d221a1294-7
01:22:59.002 --> 01:23:02.817

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.320
Looking at him and the bird is
on the the little boy's back.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:17.945
And so now the girl has the, the
red marker and the orange

af9f544c-d64a-473e-9c68-bc79c17f6e00-1
01:23:17.945 --> 01:23:22.110

01:23:26.628 --> 01:23:30.864
just kind of looking at the
purple marker. And now the girl

af9f544c-d64a-473e-9c68-bc79c17f6e00-4
01:23:30.864 --> 01:23:35.029

She's got the red key, he's got

01:24:11.931 --> 01:24:13.240
castle and it's like.

e710d4be-8577-46bf-8383-5861575876d5-0
01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.215
I mean it's really beautiful.
It's it seems like it's similar

e710d4be-8577-46bf-8383-5861575876d5-1
01:24:19.215 --> 01:24:23.470
to the last story with the, you
know, all the like gold domes

e710d4be-8577-46bf-8383-5861575876d5-2
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:27.519
and the the many rooftops and
many different buildings all

e710d4be-8577-46bf-8383-5861575876d5-3
01:24:27.519 --> 01:24:31.706
attached together. The kids are
hiding on a rock and there's

e710d4be-8577-46bf-8383-5861575876d5-4
01:24:31.706 --> 01:24:35.892
water surrounding the building
and there's a waterfall right

e710d4be-8577-46bf-8383-5861575876d5-5
01:24:35.892 --> 01:24:37.540
behind them that's like.

cced7892-f588-41b2-b38f-8978c6511bec-0
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.490
Pounding on the rock and then we
see the king is on a ship.

4a3d60e2-f2cb-48a9-b466-fdc0c8565f12-0
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:48.168
He doesn't look like he wants to
be on the ship. It looks like.

4a3d60e2-f2cb-48a9-b466-fdc0c8565f12-1
01:24:48.168 --> 01:24:52.148
He's like, they're like stealing
him. And there's several guards,

4a3d60e2-f2cb-48a9-b466-fdc0c8565f12-2
01:24:52.148 --> 01:24:55.946
there's 12345, at least five,
and then it looks like there's a

4a3d60e2-f2cb-48a9-b466-fdc0c8565f12-3
01:24:55.946 --> 01:24:59.744
whole bunch like sitting down on
the ship as well, but there's

4a3d60e2-f2cb-48a9-b466-fdc0c8565f12-4
01:24:59.744 --> 01:25:03.362
like 5 standing and they all
have like these big Spears and

4a3d60e2-f2cb-48a9-b466-fdc0c8565f12-5
01:25:03.362 --> 01:25:06.980
there's a bridge above them with
some people on the bridge.

70050b5c-9eaf-4131-91c7-40f565615cf0-0
01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:11.760
In the sky, there's some.

ef30acfe-a18a-4c88-baf2-92ade4b35004-0
01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:15.480
Air.

49bc9b6b-525a-4c01-8552-01bde0f6ae30-0
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.120
Ship air type things. Looks like
there's people on those.

f07975af-ef04-4fd1-b3b3-7d326bc91e99-0
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.110
There's a guard in the front of
the castle.

5fed65e7-1c9c-4736-a56c-d196bf2be345-0
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.710
{I can move on.}

e8ce3f31-c38a-4178-aa15-7fb52bf460d5-0
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.812
So the kids are still at their
rock with the waterfall right

e8ce3f31-c38a-4178-aa15-7fb52bf460d5-1
01:25:38.812 --> 01:25:43.197
there and the bird is there with
them and they are looking at the

e8ce3f31-c38a-4178-aa15-7fb52bf460d5-2
01:25:43.197 --> 01:25:46.917
piece of paper that the king
gave them and they're like

e8ce3f31-c38a-4178-aa15-7fb52bf460d5-3
01:25:46.917 --> 01:25:51.168
pointing at it. The ship is is
sailing away. There's a bunch of

e8ce3f31-c38a-4178-aa15-7fb52bf460d5-4
01:25:51.168 --> 01:25:54.756
people on top of the bridge.
They're on like boats or

e8ce3f31-c38a-4178-aa15-7fb52bf460d5-5
01:25:54.756 --> 01:25:55.620
gondolas and.

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-0
01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.504
There's pretty clouds in the
background of the sky, and the

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-1
01:26:01.504 --> 01:26:05.474
water looks pretty, but I don't
think it's a good situation. And

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-2
01:26:05.474 --> 01:26:08.894
then the next page, we're
looking at the thing that the

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-3
01:26:08.894 --> 01:26:12.620
king gave them. So that scroll
or that piece of paper and it

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-4
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:16.590
looks like it, maybe it's like a
map. So it is. It's got circles

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-5
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:20.316
on it. It's got yellow, green,
blue, purple, red and orange.

9b790139-39c1-4648-82d1-5a941d4418f5-6
01:26:20.316 --> 01:26:23.920
And then each of these circles
has a picture inside of it.

0c420ad6-af98-4015-b3dd-640d9243b6a1-0
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:30.008
And then around the circles
there's circles, or around the

0c420ad6-af98-4015-b3dd-640d9243b6a1-1
01:26:30.008 --> 01:26:32.970
circles that like make a
rainbow.

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-0
01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:37.265
It starts with the purple and
then it looks like it adds on

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-1
01:26:37.265 --> 01:26:41.132
with each one. So it seems like
maybe it's like a like a map to

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-2
01:26:41.132 --> 01:26:44.758
a treasure or something. So like
starts with the purple and

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-3
01:26:44.758 --> 01:26:48.565
there's a palm tree in it, and
then it moves on to the red and

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-4
01:26:48.565 --> 01:26:51.888
there's like trees with
lanterns, and then it moves on

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-5
01:26:51.888 --> 01:26:55.635
to the orange and there's the
castle, and then it moves on to

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-6
01:26:55.635 --> 01:26:59.563
the yellow and there's some sort
of a building and then it moves

d1623992-6ed5-4cf5-b971-859d545db270-7
01:26:59.563 --> 01:27:00.530
on to the green.

1ad10a25-b4aa-470d-a2f0-8eb17bbf926b-0
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.578
I don't know exactly what that
is inside, maybe another

1ad10a25-b4aa-470d-a2f0-8eb17bbf926b-1
01:27:05.578 --> 01:27:08.609
building, and then it moves on
to the blue. And the blue

1ad10a25-b4aa-470d-a2f0-8eb17bbf926b-2
01:27:08.609 --> 01:27:11.800
there's like a mountain. And
then by that time there's like

1ad10a25-b4aa-470d-a2f0-8eb17bbf926b-3
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.991
the full rainbow, so there's
like all the colors coming off

1ad10a25-b4aa-470d-a2f0-8eb17bbf926b-4
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:15.470
the blue.

1bcfee0f-912c-426c-b683-7e5e90f54cdc-0
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:18.910
{And then let's go to the next
page.}

f5f73f9c-a496-4369-adbb-1c6c6592cc07-0
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:23.660
OK, so the kids are still at
their rock. They're like hiding.

f5f73f9c-a496-4369-adbb-1c6c6592cc07-1
01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:26.516
They don't want anyone to see
them. The bird is there with

f5f73f9c-a496-4369-adbb-1c6c6592cc07-2
01:27:26.516 --> 01:27:29.565
them. They're still looking at
the picture. They're still kind

f5f73f9c-a496-4369-adbb-1c6c6592cc07-3
01:27:29.565 --> 01:27:32.469
of peeking around the rock to
see what they can see. Now it

f5f73f9c-a496-4369-adbb-1c6c6592cc07-4
01:27:32.469 --> 01:27:35.470
looks like all the people that
were up on that bridge are now

f5f73f9c-a496-4369-adbb-1c6c6592cc07-5
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:37.310
down with them on their gondolas
and.

0ab49d80-94bd-4530-923f-5f60db06c96f-0
01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.704
They're probably part of part of
the crew that captured the king,

0ab49d80-94bd-4530-923f-5f60db06c96f-1
01:27:41.704 --> 01:27:44.000
but these are people on their
own gondolas.

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-0
01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:49.504
Most of them are dressed in like
armor. One of them is dressed in

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-1
01:27:49.504 --> 01:27:52.641
some sort of gold. And I think
he's from the last story too,

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-2
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:55.830
because he's got like a like a
gold hat on, and he looks kind

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-3
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:58.967
of like one of the people that
was in the last story. And it

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-4
01:27:58.967 --> 01:28:02.362
also looks like they've got that
cage that they captured the bird

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-5
01:28:02.362 --> 01:28:05.242
in from the last story. So
somebody's holding that. And

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-6
01:28:05.242 --> 01:28:08.328
then on the next page we see the
kids and they've got their

ae467944-8120-447d-8135-5430cf22d382-7
01:28:08.328 --> 01:28:08.739
markers.

dc0ac61b-00d8-450a-83be-755c12871ffb-0
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:16.115
And they're holding up their
markers next to each other and

dc0ac61b-00d8-450a-83be-755c12871ffb-1
01:28:16.115 --> 01:28:20.260
then the girl is starting to
draw like a ball and.

b7c445c0-aefe-47f9-b2c0-181ace5bcdb5-0
01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.680
Oh, like flippers and.

c93fa92a-5f4a-4280-8fb2-cf910db0b30d-0
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.241
Like they're going to go
circling or scuba diving and the

c93fa92a-5f4a-4280-8fb2-cf910db0b30d-1
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:30.160
boy's drawn.

872bcf9e-378b-418c-925c-2d40c6ae83b5-0
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.570
I don't know. That's like a a

f7b7064d-5bd1-45e5-aeaf-b0150653b1be-0
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.420
It's like a.

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-0
01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:40.602
Octopus or something. It's like
he's drawing something. It's

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-1
01:28:40.602 --> 01:28:44.107
purple, it's got like 3 tails
and now they're diving under the

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-2
01:28:44.107 --> 01:28:47.555
water so they must be in like
scuba gear. Yep. And they're in

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-3
01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:50.837
scuba gear and they've got an
octopus with them so he drew

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-4
01:28:50.837 --> 01:28:54.285
like a giant octopus so they can
ride on it. The bird is with

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-5
01:28:54.285 --> 01:28:57.511
them too, they're under the
water. There's also some fish

7bb6982c-3153-4a6d-8611-df94c57f7e9d-6
01:28:57.511 --> 01:28:58.680
and and sharks there.

012d43dc-dbbd-4b50-b645-9cb470bbe9d8-0
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:02.750
And it's like purple under the
water.

d6d679ce-09dd-4e45-b39c-5597475e615d-0
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:09.550
And there's a building under the
water also.

11ae87b9-b5f7-42e7-8935-6424f11fb1aa-0
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.390
We can move on to the next page.

2b0ecea1-031a-4b7a-ad89-dc4c0e299ddd-0
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:19.206
And so they get to the building
and it's like a hidden treasure.

2b0ecea1-031a-4b7a-ad89-dc4c0e299ddd-1
01:29:19.206 --> 01:29:23.397
It looks like like they're
finding whatever this treasure

2b0ecea1-031a-4b7a-ad89-dc4c0e299ddd-2
01:29:23.397 --> 01:29:26.360
is and they're like taking it
from from.

18803a5c-c4f5-4581-8eb7-e1be29284d2e-0
01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:31.311
It's like a statue with
seahorses and there's something,

18803a5c-c4f5-4581-8eb7-e1be29284d2e-1
01:29:31.311 --> 01:29:34.505
there must be some sort of
treasure on the top of the

18803a5c-c4f5-4581-8eb7-e1be29284d2e-2
01:29:34.505 --> 01:29:34.920
statue.

92ff47de-1d3f-4fda-9f06-9eb4bba9e46d-0
01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:42.221
Bird is still with them, and the
next page they're hanging on to

92ff47de-1d3f-4fda-9f06-9eb4bba9e46d-1
01:29:42.221 --> 01:29:46.643
the octopus, and now all those
men in armor are following them

92ff47de-1d3f-4fda-9f06-9eb4bba9e46d-2
01:29:46.643 --> 01:29:50.854
with their Spears, so they're
all under the water too. They

92ff47de-1d3f-4fda-9f06-9eb4bba9e46d-3
01:29:50.854 --> 01:29:53.100
know that. Flippers on too, and.

8adb0145-dbfd-4483-8d14-149164d62624-0
01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.063
They are headed somewhere, so
they're following up. Let's move

8adb0145-dbfd-4483-8d14-149164d62624-1
01:29:58.063 --> 01:29:58.270
on.

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-0
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.256
The children are getting out of
the water and they're taking,

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-1
01:30:05.256 --> 01:30:08.986
the girl has taken off her
flipper. She's trying to grab

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-2
01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:13.239
the boy. Like come on, let's go
and the, Umm, the bird is flying

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-3
01:30:13.239 --> 01:30:17.427
up above. They're running into
like a bunch of palm trees, like

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-4
01:30:17.427 --> 01:30:21.222
a little island, and they're
drawing together. So I don't

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-5
01:30:21.222 --> 01:30:25.083
know exactly what it is, but the
boys drawing some kind of

3eee4b59-bf28-4681-b829-5d742ba11d8f-6
01:30:25.083 --> 01:30:29.140
circular and triangle thing and
the girls drawing like a box.

e74ead49-8e20-43bd-9d64-79e0086ed6d4-0
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.984
{Let's move on.} And then so
they've entered some sort of

e74ead49-8e20-43bd-9d64-79e0086ed6d4-1
01:30:34.984 --> 01:30:37.570
other magical land. Now they've
got a.

f4dfdfdd-0c24-4740-ac3a-be8ca3e31038-0
01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:42.620
Right now, aceros that they're
writing on and.

67ae7950-8b8f-4e3e-96c3-87866b6b292e-0
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.583
Like a little tent on top of it,
like a red tent and a purple

67ae7950-8b8f-4e3e-96c3-87866b6b292e-1
01:30:47.583 --> 01:30:48.340
rhinoceros.

d3c1e035-2c56-4bea-8620-6afc9bfc6441-0
01:30:52.210 --> 01:30:57.769
The land's first it's like kind
of like pyramids, and then

d3c1e035-2c56-4bea-8620-6afc9bfc6441-1
01:30:57.769 --> 01:31:01.350
there's water and there's like a
big.

b8dabb66-cdca-4387-b4d0-483684d95844-0
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.218
Pyramid-y thing in the
background, like on its own

b8dabb66-cdca-4387-b4d0-483684d95844-1
01:31:06.218 --> 01:31:06.710
island.

a0bb14cf-9dcc-419b-8ae4-13abf249a76a-0
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:09.780
I can move on.

82e2b138-8327-413a-a4b4-5417a25b6c69-0
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.532
And there's a big bridge and the
kids are running on the bridge.

82e2b138-8327-413a-a4b4-5417a25b6c69-1
01:31:15.532 --> 01:31:19.359
It's like a rope bridge. And and
the kids are running and the

82e2b138-8327-413a-a4b4-5417a25b6c69-2
01:31:19.359 --> 01:31:23.001
purple bird is with them and
that's that's leading them to

82e2b138-8327-413a-a4b4-5417a25b6c69-3
01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:23.310
that.

1ce13f04-385d-49a6-b699-2b1887424ebb-0
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.707
Pyramid thing that it's on its
own island and it has like a

1ce13f04-385d-49a6-b699-2b1887424ebb-1
01:31:27.707 --> 01:31:31.558
light on top. You can see like a
yellow glow on top of it and

1ce13f04-385d-49a6-b699-2b1887424ebb-2
01:31:31.558 --> 01:31:35.286
there's a whole bunch of birds
in the sky and there's water

1ce13f04-385d-49a6-b699-2b1887424ebb-3
01:31:35.286 --> 01:31:36.280
underneath them.

0d26e18f-f732-4695-94b7-3cd75a1b72ba-0
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:39.940
Bridge does not look very stable
at all.

04e3b9a3-30c2-4d56-8dfb-afa73430af74-0
01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:47.292
{And we can move on to the next
and} OK, so they've made it to

04e3b9a3-30c2-4d56-8dfb-afa73430af74-1
01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:51.150
the other side. They're standing
on top of the.

2016bceb-b00f-4c30-931c-d5b904c9f473-0
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.392
The pyramid thing, they're like
right at the top where the light

2016bceb-b00f-4c30-931c-d5b904c9f473-1
01:31:55.392 --> 01:31:58.893
is and the bird is with them.
And now all the men in armor are

2016bceb-b00f-4c30-931c-d5b904c9f473-2
01:31:58.893 --> 01:32:01.949
running across the bridge
towards them, pointing their

2016bceb-b00f-4c30-931c-d5b904c9f473-3
01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:05.395
Spears at them, and the kids are
drawing again. So the boy is

2016bceb-b00f-4c30-931c-d5b904c9f473-4
01:32:05.395 --> 01:32:06.840
drawing something. That's.

9aa9893d-82db-4f50-a767-afe3d0732176-0
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.987
No, it's some kind of like Oval
type things. And then the girls

9aa9893d-82db-4f50-a767-afe3d0732176-1
01:32:10.987 --> 01:32:13.832
drawing some sort of box looking
thing, they still got the

9aa9893d-82db-4f50-a767-afe3d0732176-2
01:32:13.832 --> 01:32:16.871
scroll, they still got the bird
and they've got whatever their

9aa9893d-82db-4f50-a767-afe3d0732176-3
01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:18.560
treasure is, they've got that
too.

b9855cae-18b5-4108-9490-e5420198820c-0
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:25.220
{Let's move on to the next} and
now they're on.

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-0
01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.133
So she drew a swing, and he
drew. It's like a giant

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-1
01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:32.695
dragonfly that's like flying
them away. So the the men in

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-2
01:32:32.695 --> 01:32:36.319
armor are right there, and
they're like so close that they

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-3
01:32:36.319 --> 01:32:39.943
can't get them. They're like
reaching out to get them. And

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-4
01:32:39.943 --> 01:32:43.935
the kids are on their swing and
they're floating away with their

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-5
01:32:43.935 --> 01:32:47.804
big giant dragonfly. There's a
whole bunch of mountains in the

87d8822b-a1de-46ca-8034-07a2d3caecaf-6
01:32:47.804 --> 01:32:48.479
background.

8ac0aa49-6012-453b-884e-b297767ff929-0
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:51.300
{We can move on.}

2cc51031-9829-40ca-ba29-4acea84c4d5b-0
01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:58.290
And the dragonfly thingy drops
them off at a Buddha statue and

2cc51031-9829-40ca-ba29-4acea84c4d5b-1
01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:02.729
now oops all the armored men are
following as well. They've got

2cc51031-9829-40ca-ba29-4acea84c4d5b-2
01:33:02.729 --> 01:33:06.614
they've all got some kind of
flying things that they're

2cc51031-9829-40ca-ba29-4acea84c4d5b-3
01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:10.984
following in. The kids are on
top of the Buddha statue and OK,

2cc51031-9829-40ca-ba29-4acea84c4d5b-4
01:33:10.984 --> 01:33:13.619
so it looks like they had to
collect.

90238d1a-ca62-4149-becb-f1e601b76d3f-0
01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.169
All these different colors, so
there's like a belt with a whole

90238d1a-ca62-4149-becb-f1e601b76d3f-1
01:33:17.169 --> 01:33:19.999
bunch of different colors that
was like the treasure thing that

90238d1a-ca62-4149-becb-f1e601b76d3f-2
01:33:19.999 --> 01:33:21.369
they were getting from the map.

856b2012-ae51-4ac5-9f73-4ef7ee4b5fe3-0
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:26.472
So now we see that they've
collected them all and they're

856b2012-ae51-4ac5-9f73-4ef7ee4b5fe3-1
01:33:26.472 --> 01:33:30.402
at, they must be at their final
destination. So they're holding

856b2012-ae51-4ac5-9f73-4ef7ee4b5fe3-2
01:33:30.402 --> 01:33:34.271
it up. The bird is with them.
They're like standing on top and

856b2012-ae51-4ac5-9f73-4ef7ee4b5fe3-3
01:33:34.271 --> 01:33:35.929
just kind of holding it up.

1ebcc9ba-27b3-4533-ad9b-cba0ed2eb000-0
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:38.020
{And move on.}

3663e08a-72a9-4ec6-bc51-4ccdbd6a39ff-0
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:40.920
And.

4aec0549-e190-4cbd-ab1f-d76a2165f061-0
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:46.226
The men in armor are right
there. They're trying to grab

4aec0549-e190-4cbd-ab1f-d76a2165f061-1
01:33:46.226 --> 01:33:48.100
the bird. They've got that cage.

99ace5d8-625f-462b-a8bc-251214a0ff09-0
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.470
Trying to.

b7dbbd28-2fe6-4860-9f33-5daea34f3f13-0
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:54.873
Trying to get anything that they
can, and then they're like

b7dbbd28-2fe6-4860-9f33-5daea34f3f13-1
01:33:54.873 --> 01:33:58.460
holding out their shield, their
swords at them.

ecc8b775-967b-41cf-bd5e-226e4d83408d-0
01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:02.420
The kids are just standing on
top. I don't know if they grab

ecc8b775-967b-41cf-bd5e-226e4d83408d-1
01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:05.495
the thing. I can't. I don't see
the treasure thing anymore. I'm

ecc8b775-967b-41cf-bd5e-226e4d83408d-2
01:34:05.495 --> 01:34:08.474
not sure if it's still there or
not. Oh, I think the bird has

ecc8b775-967b-41cf-bd5e-226e4d83408d-3
01:34:08.474 --> 01:34:10.300
it. Looks like the bird maybe
has it.

0328343a-3aa5-40c2-8852-1a53a20396c4-0
01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:14.167
That's why they're trying to
grab the bird. OK, and then we

0328343a-3aa5-40c2-8852-1a53a20396c4-1
01:34:14.167 --> 01:34:15.200
move on to the next page.

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-0
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.063
Oh, OK, so the bird is flying
away with it, and it is forming

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-1
01:34:20.063 --> 01:34:23.988
a giant rainbow there at the end
of the rainbow. And the rainbow

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-2
01:34:23.988 --> 01:34:27.913
looks like it must be so bright
that the men in armor like can't

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-3
01:34:27.913 --> 01:34:31.597
even stand it because their
planes are falling down from the

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-4
01:34:31.597 --> 01:34:35.340
sky and they're like hands are
over their eyes and they don't

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-5
01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:39.024
even want to look at it, and
they're like, I'll just falling

ea510c8d-2e71-4c5b-9444-de727bd672b9-6
01:34:39.024 --> 01:34:39.930
out of the sky.

ec6e7f37-3e82-4be0-abe2-84bfc31c0470-0
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:48.117
And there's a big giant rainbow,
and at the other end of the

ec6e7f37-3e82-4be0-abe2-84bfc31c0470-1
01:34:48.117 --> 01:34:52.821
rainbow there's the king. So the
bird found the king and he's

ec6e7f37-3e82-4be0-abe2-84bfc31c0470-2
01:34:52.821 --> 01:34:57.601
like holding up his arms like
yay. And then the all the men in

ec6e7f37-3e82-4be0-abe2-84bfc31c0470-3
01:34:57.601 --> 01:35:01.546
armor on the ship are like
falling off the ship and

ec6e7f37-3e82-4be0-abe2-84bfc31c0470-4
01:35:01.546 --> 01:35:04.960
covering their eyes because it's
too bright.

f96e867f-daa7-4318-a24c-063e114ae670-0
01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:12.548
And now there's like a big
rainbow over the castle. It's

f96e867f-daa7-4318-a24c-063e114ae670-1
01:35:12.548 --> 01:35:13.890
really beautiful.

9a831631-0a38-4974-9bd9-29bea542da61-0
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:20.383
And it looks like there's like
everybody's happy. There's a big

9a831631-0a38-4974-9bd9-29bea542da61-1
01:35:20.383 --> 01:35:24.330
dragonfly thing in the sky.
There's the octopus below,

9a831631-0a38-4974-9bd9-29bea542da61-2
01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:28.780
there's the rhinoceros and the
king, and the two children are

9a831631-0a38-4974-9bd9-29bea542da61-3
01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:32.800
on the rhinoceros and they're
like waving to everybody.

5b9dbf0d-6c1a-4628-905c-9532f7fd4f9a-0
01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:42.089
And the bird is there too. And
now we are back at the the

5b9dbf0d-6c1a-4628-905c-9532f7fd4f9a-1
01:35:42.089 --> 01:35:46.714
little waterfall and the rock
that the kids were hiding

5b9dbf0d-6c1a-4628-905c-9532f7fd4f9a-2
01:35:46.714 --> 01:35:52.082
behind, and the little boy's on
the rock. The King is is walking

5b9dbf0d-6c1a-4628-905c-9532f7fd4f9a-3
01:35:52.082 --> 01:35:57.450
down some stairs and the little
girl is still on the rhinoceros.

8c7904f0-c864-4f3f-997b-1709fa645dcf-0
01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.883
The dragonfly thingy's up in the
background, the octopuses there,

8c7904f0-c864-4f3f-997b-1709fa645dcf-1
01:36:02.883 --> 01:36:04.660
the rainbow still there, and.

faa3cb03-89f1-4fd0-b285-eaa85d9c8787-0
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:09.300
OK, so they've given the king
back his orange marker.

e2bf71b4-6d89-4326-9ef3-6cf27e9c6088-0
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:14.060
The kids are standing by like a
doorway and.

8279005c-124a-4918-84db-ca755c966081-0
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:18.459
The king is drawing with his
orange marker and he's drawing

8279005c-124a-4918-84db-ca755c966081-1
01:36:18.459 --> 01:36:22.149
crowns for the kids. So he's
putting crowns on the kids and

8279005c-124a-4918-84db-ca755c966081-2
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:25.962
they are waving goodbye. And
he's kind of like, his hands are

8279005c-124a-4918-84db-ca755c966081-3
01:36:25.962 --> 01:36:30.021
like together, like in a prayer,
like thank you position. And the

8279005c-124a-4918-84db-ca755c966081-4
01:36:30.021 --> 01:36:33.957
kids and the bird are like going
through the doorway and waving

8279005c-124a-4918-84db-ca755c966081-5
01:36:33.957 --> 01:36:36.110
goodbye to the king. And now
they.

657bba42-6c57-4d3d-a1f6-7d6533024b4e-0
01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:41.007
Now the rainbow is on the other
side, so the rainbow is like

657bba42-6c57-4d3d-a1f6-7d6533024b4e-1
01:36:41.007 --> 01:36:43.260
back where they originally
started.

b97d5b61-b010-4132-b05a-d686f366f316-0
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.563
And they're looking out at the
city and the rainbow. They've

b97d5b61-b010-4132-b05a-d686f366f316-1
01:36:46.563 --> 01:36:47.940
got their crown done. #END_quest

01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.210
Three stories left and one.

09986aec-3429-4267-882d-2343df220fb1-0

01:38:12.201 --> 01:38:12.950
short.

3d9efa5a-6179-4a16-bef3-fce10e112f98-0

And the other one is 4.

9ebafda2-19a8-4d7d-8d48-4b6a7ec27958-0
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:25.140
OK. So like we might be able to
finish everything.

a601f000-d3f6-47ff-a3b8-3df0cf002b73-0
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:27.790
Um, so.

c4f5ff91-31ea-43b7-a549-ba71b9cfed56-0
01:38:28.690 --> 01:38:33.912
Yeah, just like probably like 10
minutes for the story. We'll try

c4f5ff91-31ea-43b7-a549-ba71b9cfed56-1
01:38:33.912 --> 01:38:38.660
like I'll try to pace it. So.
OK, alright, sounds good. OK.

cfe2e4bc-0d55-4369-ae63-80d1a710ad2f-0
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:43.950
#START_wanderer OK, so we start
out with two people together.

cfe2e4bc-0d55-4369-ae63-80d1a710ad2f-1
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:47.718
One of them is dressed up like,
I don't know, maybe like a

cfe2e4bc-0d55-4369-ae63-80d1a710ad2f-2
01:38:47.718 --> 01:38:51.934
superhero or something. He's got
like a horn in front of his head

cfe2e4bc-0d55-4369-ae63-80d1a710ad2f-3
01:38:51.934 --> 01:38:53.340
and a horn in back or.

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-0
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:58.824
Maybe, yeah, that's what it
looks like. And then he's got

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-1
01:38:58.824 --> 01:39:03.340
like a Cape on, and then the
other person has like a striped

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-2
01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:07.856
shirt on and they've got like a
big giant piece of paper and

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-3
01:39:07.856 --> 01:39:12.225
they're folding it together into
like origami. And they're

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-4
01:39:12.225 --> 01:39:16.519
working together on it and
they're making it into a paper

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-5
01:39:16.519 --> 01:39:21.109
ship. And on the next page we
see a a real ship, like a giant

65c1f5b9-b249-4f51-840b-082c7bd4e5d4-6
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.480
ship.

cb81c156-9840-41a4-b6d7-8958b49a5c71-0
01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.533
And also, oh I'm sorry, and the
little origami ship is next to

cb81c156-9840-41a4-b6d7-8958b49a5c71-1
01:39:27.533 --> 01:39:27.710
it.

d9d9980a-594f-4751-b703-768d7abf68bd-0
01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:30.840
And then you can keep going.

b87a634a-7027-49aa-a383-37016517fb25-0
01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:37.496
And then we see some birds in
the sky, so there's like a bunch

b87a634a-7027-49aa-a383-37016517fb25-1
01:39:37.496 --> 01:39:42.169
of white birds. And then that
little origami ship is down

b87a634a-7027-49aa-a383-37016517fb25-2
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:47.407
below in the water, just kind of
sailing along and the birds are

b87a634a-7027-49aa-a383-37016517fb25-3
01:39:47.407 --> 01:39:52.241
still in the sky. The origami
ship is down and there's like

b87a634a-7027-49aa-a383-37016517fb25-4
01:39:52.241 --> 01:39:56.190
turtles and a bird like all over
by it and then.

e5367194-611a-4903-b1fc-26b3e60326a4-0
01:39:57.630 --> 01:40:00.579
Might be a whale. Oh, I'm sorry.
And then the next page we see

e5367194-611a-4903-b1fc-26b3e60326a4-1
01:40:00.579 --> 01:40:02.966
the origami ship again and
there's like a whale or

e5367194-611a-4903-b1fc-26b3e60326a4-2
01:40:02.966 --> 01:40:03.950
something next to it.

5d0c9e8b-7770-4f0c-9a8f-bdced54edd5f-0
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.130
And now the.

333f725b-2995-4744-a593-575cb5067ba4-0
01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:11.410
Is that a whale? I'm going to
say it's a whale.

cb04883d-57b4-4516-a721-dc6abc45afcc-0
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:18.316
The whale is wearing the little
origami ship like a hat and we

cb04883d-57b4-4516-a721-dc6abc45afcc-1
01:40:18.316 --> 01:40:18.660
see.

3dc07cff-7348-4f1c-8573-39d762b9ab8d-0
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:24.023
Fish, we see a bunch of fish, we
see a whole bunch of fish and

3dc07cff-7348-4f1c-8573-39d762b9ab8d-1
01:40:24.023 --> 01:40:27.110
then like plant life, that's
underneath the water.

0c21777e-1bae-43fc-b388-1c5688809fea-0
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:32.430
And yeah, and then.

d8a42d25-6079-42e9-90f7-04d80f574019-0
01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.970
The so now the origami ship is
back on the water. The whale is

d8a42d25-6079-42e9-90f7-04d80f574019-1
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:42.094
no longer there and we see a
whole bunch of the plant life.

d8a42d25-6079-42e9-90f7-04d80f574019-2
01:40:42.094 --> 01:40:43.950
We see a bunch of the fish.

1de3666d-ea44-45be-8f40-f99a87aaaa63-0
01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.398
Everything's just kind of
swimming along underneath the

1de3666d-ea44-45be-8f40-f99a87aaaa63-1
01:40:48.398 --> 01:40:48.700
water.

2bf95718-aa2a-410e-8d6e-e37e21750365-0
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:55.650
Yeah, there's a lot of fish and
keep going and.

673a9eb2-b8b0-4f68-88bb-1d7704d8e5aa-0
01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.480
Um, it's like little tadpoles.

0eaf58d2-2c49-46dc-99c2-86bf77fd7832-0
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:07.109
There's some fish like kissing
now the the origami ship has a

0eaf58d2-2c49-46dc-99c2-86bf77fd7832-1
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:11.230
fishing pole and it's caught a
fish under the water.

7832f0ad-40c5-4277-b639-b38689a32b6e-0
01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:14.240
Thank you. Move on.

f2358844-d85c-4086-b7f4-19c297bd708e-0

And.

025d318d-540b-4e0a-9319-f68ad888843f-0
01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:24.300
So there's OK, so there's the
origami ship, and then there's

025d318d-540b-4e0a-9319-f68ad888843f-1
01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:28.823
like fish that are like standing
up in the water. And one of them

025d318d-540b-4e0a-9319-f68ad888843f-2
01:41:28.823 --> 01:41:32.593
is, it's like a checkered
seahorse and it has a little

025d318d-540b-4e0a-9319-f68ad888843f-3
01:41:32.593 --> 01:41:36.773
origami. I mean, it looks just
like the origami ship, except

025d318d-540b-4e0a-9319-f68ad888843f-4
01:41:36.773 --> 01:41:41.159
he's wearing it like a hat and
it's tiny. And then on the next.

400a287e-2fd5-4c2b-abe0-9d4ded9afae8-0

Page we see he's like on the
origami ship, he's wearing it.

400a287e-2fd5-4c2b-abe0-9d4ded9afae8-1
01:41:46.216 --> 01:41:50.359
So this is the seahorse. He's
wearing his hat and there's like

400a287e-2fd5-4c2b-abe0-9d4ded9afae8-2
01:41:50.359 --> 01:41:52.070
a big snake thing that is.

13d08b20-4f16-45fa-b6b2-df2ced7ed665-0
01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:58.412
Right there as well. So like
trying to board the origami

13d08b20-4f16-45fa-b6b2-df2ced7ed665-1
01:41:58.412 --> 01:41:58.750
ship.

076ee46c-81e6-4563-970d-80f88afa48ac-0

In the tree, it looks like
there's like a bunch of cranes

7de0beb0-8468-4814-86c0-785590df2c0f-1
01:42:14.931 --> 01:42:15.150

3383cd2b-bf56-4203-9fe5-6ef252784ff9-0
01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:28.780
And the seahorse is still in the
origami ship.

28ceeba1-2919-4b2c-86ef-ce958dd954d3-0
01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.600
We can move on.

d32f1ba9-5809-42b2-a4f6-60eb8f02c7f9-0
01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:38.130
And now it's going past
everything. So it's going past

d32f1ba9-5809-42b2-a4f6-60eb8f02c7f9-1
01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:40.720
the cranes, it's going past all
the.

38d93d6e-fce1-421a-b605-338e1a4e2d3c-0
01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:45.060
Bushes. We can see the fish
below it.

97bedb15-a97b-416f-ab95-543f4c739738-0
01:42:46.770 --> 01:42:47.920
Keep going.

4dd5253a-419e-415d-84e6-58f24a28fe34-0
01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:53.030
Now it's darker.

93f20142-436d-491f-8d62-cd247b6b526d-0
01:42:54.150 --> 01:42:56.870
The seahorse is still on the
origami ship.

ea51d1d7-8303-4d56-9d4b-5b4de36da029-0
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.970
We're going past bird.

0daace09-9077-40ee-9aa9-c0bf76ca7b9e-0

Some looks like maybe people, I
don't know. There's just like

98d40128-9f63-4030-af5c-9719a6322dbd-1
01:43:07.396 --> 01:43:11.943
arms that you can see. You can't
see the people, but you can see

98d40128-9f63-4030-af5c-9719a6322dbd-2
01:43:11.943 --> 01:43:16.000
arms and hands and some birds
with like glowing eyes and.

5ddabe87-27a3-425e-844d-613dcfe5e23c-0
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:19.760
Some other animal that's got
like some glowing eyes.

fc33444a-fa09-4bbd-89f3-89bc315885b4-0
01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:23.850
Yeah, and move on.

04ad2a43-7481-4b7a-a2a4-2a3c6ea3ba4c-0
01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:25.920
And then.

2e1b21f2-75b1-4d46-8e21-851b374cbe61-0
01:43:26.630 --> 01:43:31.170
Now there's a whole bunch of
seahorse checkered seahorses.

353ea8ff-36a6-4b61-b07d-2e61e8ecad29-0
01:43:32.210 --> 01:43:33.000
Um.

98b89f47-b1e3-4e4c-8262-ca45f0794db0-0
01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.293
So it's kind of like this, the
seahorse has found its family

98b89f47-b1e3-4e4c-8262-ca45f0794db0-1
01:43:39.293 --> 01:43:43.166

came off and it came out of the

98b89f47-b1e3-4e4c-8262-ca45f0794db0-2
01:43:43.166 --> 01:43:45.770
origami ship and the ship is
sailing on.

2bc26455-cf7a-46aa-87cf-c4940e0247f1-0
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:49.040
Might keep going.

1e72d906-50cd-4360-9f6b-a7ed0ee7d505-0
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:56.237
OK, so now the origami ship is
still sailing and now we're at.

1e72d906-50cd-4360-9f6b-a7ed0ee7d505-1
01:43:56.237 --> 01:43:57.330

01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:05.248
Umm, with its part of its head
above the water, and there's a

ab281f6c-a642-45a4-824e-0fb86521189a-1
01:44:05.248 --> 01:44:07.720
bunch of birds on top of its
head.

89c52fe9-8379-42dc-85ab-4e075428b3e4-0
01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:12.581
Most of it is under the water,
though, and there's tiny little

89c52fe9-8379-42dc-85ab-4e075428b3e4-1
01:44:12.581 --> 01:44:14.590

13f0b7b9-5fac-4dd0-ac5b-b0f3bb23cce9-0
01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:20.011
I don't know what it has. It's
got like something coming out of

13f0b7b9-5fac-4dd0-ac5b-b0f3bb23cce9-1
01:44:20.011 --> 01:44:21.290
its spout, but it's like a.

704ba989-3b05-48f8-9b3c-02c01045d574-0
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.743
Like a fishing pole or
something. And it also has like

704ba989-3b05-48f8-9b3c-02c01045d574-1
01:44:26.743 --> 01:44:27.950
legs and stuff.

afcaa4ba-4047-405c-b3ce-d1750e663ca4-0
01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.570
And the the little origami ship
is is.

2032cae8-e7a3-441f-b5e6-fe275561aae4-0
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:35.400

01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:40.227
Yeah, so it like sprouted a
bunch of stuff. I don't know

8002d55d-bcbc-429d-805a-4cb89c4462f6-1
01:44:40.227 --> 01:44:43.371
what what happened to the whale
or if that's maybe something

8002d55d-bcbc-429d-805a-4cb89c4462f6-2
01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:46.618
different, but it's similar in
shape to the whale. It might be

8002d55d-bcbc-429d-805a-4cb89c4462f6-3
01:44:46.618 --> 01:44:48.680
something different and we can
move on.

f2502ba1-25d5-4868-8f69-1c44e5d868de-0
01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:51.710
And then.

01:45:26.684 --> 01:45:30.446
things about and the origami
ship is still there on the

fcc70d92-3508-4c41-a5ea-b38cda065760-2
01:45:30.446 --> 01:45:30.850
water.

e9868f07-9d5c-4a7d-9ea4-9f1c18400b78-0

floating past all these stars
and a moon and a dark sky.

got like weird looking hands. So
it's not like a person, but

f08cb7f9-4294-4c29-a816-13b690f7c4e4-2
01:47:11.117 --> 01:47:16.170
they're in a scuba type outfit

He's like being towed by it,
like by a rope. And now there's.

daa73bc4-001d-45cf-b396-11b3bd5dfca9-0
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:25.425

Origami boat is in the wave.
It's like riding up the wave.

6b0cb4ed-4fea-4354-a1fa-9bde8d6ad8c4-0
01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:33.620

01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:38.946
And there's the origami boat. It
made it out. And then on the

a3d31925-c6ae-4d57-9ca6-7af297843c1e-1

6cf9b217-f629-4d48-9b12-293825af7cb4-1
01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:47.935

01:52:47.935 --> 01:52:52.314
animal looking things. One looks

OK, so there's the origami boat
and they're like pouring water

74cf1c87-bbba-408c-975e-61a8f4816452-1
01:53:14.311 --> 01:53:18.778
into the boat. So we've got
those two animals and they're

74cf1c87-bbba-408c-975e-61a8f4816452-2
01:53:18.778 --> 01:53:23.476
like the one's like spewing
water into the boat. And then on

74cf1c87-bbba-408c-975e-61a8f4816452-3
01:53:23.476 --> 01:53:25.709

01:53:30.992 --> 01:53:35.432
that's the origami boat in the
water. Maybe it's kind of like

c3d3510d-28c0-4936-beb3-e05dd972e823-2
01:53:35.432 --> 01:53:37.080

c3b5eaa3-33af-4333-bffa-bf6a49d9f168-0
01:53:49.710 --> 01:53:55.236
And now we're underwater. So the
origami boat has gone underwater

c3b5eaa3-33af-4333-bffa-bf6a49d9f168-1
01:53:55.236 --> 01:53:56.660

jellyfish under the water with

665e87aa-a501-4e9c-8e40-e73dc470dfd7-1

Some kind of fish, amphibian,
animal thingy is like making a

a2e1aa66-7bed-43e5-a2a7-0d0c32855c4d-1
01:54:40.718 --> 01:54:44.824
home in it, and there's like
light shining down on it. It

a2e1aa66-7bed-43e5-a2a7-0d0c32855c4d-2
01:54:44.824 --> 01:54:49.072
looks like it must be like at
the bottom of the ocean maybe

a2e1aa66-7bed-43e5-a2a7-0d0c32855c4d-3
01:54:49.072 --> 01:54:49.710

bunch of things around it.

e3d1d127-498c-4a36-bda7-985678a4d336-0
01:55:16.210 --> 01:55:19.443
And they're kind of like V
shaped and light and then like,

e3d1d127-498c-4a36-bda7-985678a4d336-1
01:55:19.443 --> 01:55:21.690

page.

c1e553d6-ebd2-4345-b1f0-799f7d99a09b-0
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.364
And that ship submarine thing
brought it up to the top of the

c1e553d6-ebd2-4345-b1f0-799f7d99a09b-1
01:55:31.364 --> 01:55:36.248
water and it's pouring the water
out of the origami boat and

c1e553d6-ebd2-4345-b1f0-799f7d99a09b-2
01:55:36.248 --> 01:55:37.930
there's another ship.

616b3353-e714-46c8-955f-a71ccbaf4346-0
01:55:38.610 --> 01:55:43.068
Like half ship, half sea
creature there at the top of the

616b3353-e714-46c8-955f-a71ccbaf4346-1
01:55:43.068 --> 01:55:47.910
water as well. A bunch of birds
oop and now it's like floating

616b3353-e714-46c8-955f-a71ccbaf4346-2
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:51.370
past that ship thingy, that ship
fish thing.

a47f9e3a-d7f4-4b87-936c-74195e27696c-0
01:55:52.630 --> 01:55:54.160

Or sea otters, maybe seals or
sea otters and they're like

f8ca659f-fd91-40dd-b2b6-7c421c9a8371-1

Origami boat.

6b97bbf1-94b8-4fde-a929-ff08867e03dd-0
01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.220
You see some other underwater
life as well.

5d6859ea-4e6d-4ce3-8046-ae559e62faca-0
01:56:20.110 --> 01:56:21.590

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.485
Now it's floating on the water.
It's back on top of the water.

2bf27949-2c05-415b-8d47-9a979b3c565f-1

01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:44.153
And the next page, it's kind of
tipping a little bit. There's

3544bf06-4b72-4fde-88fd-da96375c81a9-1

01:56:57.170 --> 01:56:59.640
I don't know what that is, if

01b76c46-9d3e-4c42-94ce-3de6df8a439c-0
01:57:00.370 --> 01:57:03.170
There's like stuff with the
person and there's definitely

01b76c46-9d3e-4c42-94ce-3de6df8a439c-1
01:57:03.170 --> 01:57:04.330
fish down there as well.

628b7ac8-ca9a-4b2d-85e2-0c7bbff3c576-0
01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:07.360
And keep going.

5b9efc46-d13b-4ed4-9548-71c1aaedfdef-0

01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.876
And now we have like a
lighthouse type thing. It's,

a6fa6ed7-ca53-44c8-a18d-431228f32065-1
01:57:19.876 --> 01:57:24.579
it's going past it and there's a
bunch of like animal flesh

01:57:24.579 --> 01:57:29.283
people on it on that and birds.
And then the next page it's

a6fa6ed7-ca53-44c8-a18d-431228f32065-3
01:57:29.283 --> 01:57:34.300
floating past another lighthouse
and the lighthouse is like on.

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:39.007
A little tiny piece of land and
there's a person on the piece of

a9d4e16a-4dcf-405d-b529-d69aff43cce3-1
01:57:39.007 --> 01:57:41.760
land and there's some ships in
the background.

fb06ac74-9c4c-4dec-9377-24ec8ac5b137-0

01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.050
Big metal.

16505a76-f2f0-4e40-95b3-78b02f10082d-0
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:09.310
It's not a building, but it's

That's floating past that, and
that's floating past. Oh wait, I

5a04c9c1-508f-43ec-99e6-cd44f1c74483-1

01:58:43.170 --> 01:58:46.701
Maybe a ship it's like it landed
on a ship and then there's

c1b2c3a5-a0eb-415a-b524-5c705a5f2185-1
01:58:46.701 --> 01:58:48.290

e398e7c1-e0a0-485a-b0a0-38b2cfedff4d-0
02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:29.370
Couple. There's some birds,
there's buildings, there's

e398e7c1-e0a0-485a-b0a0-38b2cfedff4d-1
02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:31.290
bridges over the water.

0412957b-a501-4aa4-8571-cd4b60417fb6-0
02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:34.070
And keep going.

4709cf9f-9575-4327-8a9e-188ee618d9cf-0
02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:37.970
And.

524b22cd-d214-4d32-979f-3a60b73d20d3-0
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:44.120
Floating past a bunch of animals
again, there's that superhero

524b22cd-d214-4d32-979f-3a60b73d20d3-1
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.830
looking guy with the horn and
the jester's there. I think this

524b22cd-d214-4d32-979f-3a60b73d20d3-2
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:53.466
is all the people that were on
that one boat, because there's

524b22cd-d214-4d32-979f-3a60b73d20d3-3
02:01:53.466 --> 02:01:58.027
the jester and the horse and the
cat and like a spaceman and

524b22cd-d214-4d32-979f-3a60b73d20d3-4
02:01:58.027 --> 02:02:02.139
they're all there together and
just floating past and.

a8d88bb7-a3bf-40ff-9010-184f8690a2bc-0
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:06.330
Then it's moving on. It's going
through kind of like a tunnel.

f23211ab-22d3-43ea-8459-1dc63fe38d6c-0
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.950
And keep going.

b5d5f223-2990-44b5-b962-2a1d2fe3e44f-0
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:17.523
There it's well, it's through
the tunnel. We can see the moon,

b5d5f223-2990-44b5-b962-2a1d2fe3e44f-1
02:02:17.523 --> 02:02:21.316
we can see the stars, we see
Street lights. There's like some

b5d5f223-2990-44b5-b962-2a1d2fe3e44f-2
02:02:21.316 --> 02:02:24.925
fish or some kind of animals
watching it go by and they've

b5d5f223-2990-44b5-b962-2a1d2fe3e44f-3
02:02:24.925 --> 02:02:26.700
got like little lighted eyes.

3f5483e7-9004-43e7-aede-9295f9d531af-0
02:02:27.810 --> 02:02:28.980
And keep going.

7a644b5f-4ef8-494d-9f4c-062abafbd207-0
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:35.798
Um, and it is headed towards
what looks like a house, the

7a644b5f-4ef8-494d-9f4c-062abafbd207-1
02:02:35.798 --> 02:02:40.021
street light. There's like one
street light and a little house

7a644b5f-4ef8-494d-9f4c-062abafbd207-2
02:02:40.021 --> 02:02:44.378
and headed that way. And then we
just see it going, going, going

7a644b5f-4ef8-494d-9f4c-062abafbd207-3
02:02:44.378 --> 02:02:46.389
now they're OK. And then there

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-0
02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:51.257
It looks like there was like
somebody inside, so like a real

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-1
02:02:51.257 --> 02:02:54.834
faint shadow of a person. And
then by the third picture, we

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-2
02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:58.411
can kind of see him stepping
off. And then we see them walk

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-3
02:02:58.411 --> 02:03:01.810
off the origami boat and now
he's walking up the stairs.

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-4
02:03:01.810 --> 02:03:05.626
There's somebody at the top of
the stairs. And then we see just

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-5
02:03:05.626 --> 02:03:09.024
their feet together. So like,
they're standing together.

74584fca-1c34-4c5b-a0cd-d133c819f20f-6
02:03:09.024 --> 02:03:09.800

02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.100
And move on.

c6bd9094-ef73-459b-8a53-43a63ef9bda5-0
02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:15.400
OK.

0a366192-a5f7-4247-a7e3-ce672db85a53-0
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.960
OK, this is the next story.

2bb7fbde-0d10-4be4-ab39-33786fd871e9-0
02:03:33.450 --> 02:03:33.920
OK.

c2f548a1-1edc-4e9e-9635-f0fad5e7cf7c-0
02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:55.650
All right.

66bd4e49-82ca-45e7-ad4c-f9e56c5564bb-0
02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:00.774
#START_arrival_3 OK, so it
starts out we see a man holding

66bd4e49-82ca-45e7-ad4c-f9e56c5564bb-1
02:04:00.774 --> 02:04:05.287
a sign, a couple signs and then
like a maybe like a newspaper

66bd4e49-82ca-45e7-ad4c-f9e56c5564bb-2
02:04:05.287 --> 02:04:06.670
underneath his arm.

d1e81b9c-bcd4-43d6-a2ae-fdbcd39a1bbc-0
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:11.547
The next picture we see two
women with one of them is

d1e81b9c-bcd4-43d6-a2ae-fdbcd39a1bbc-1
02:04:11.547 --> 02:04:12.680
holding like a.

4d00903b-ba09-4e39-be34-6b2f0120af07-0
02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:19.235
Cat type animal and then on the
next picture we see a person

4d00903b-ba09-4e39-be34-6b2f0120af07-1
02:04:19.235 --> 02:04:20.360
with like a.

6f372f9e-e99c-4252-ba71-3c27006a1296-0
02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:24.420
Like a spiky animal and he's got
a cart.

7ee6b285-6ec1-438a-81db-38c4dd08fde5-0
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.180
That's like.

dea222f4-8c97-4690-8c20-27dd488d1f25-0
02:04:26.850 --> 02:04:31.150
Maybe it's like a tea cart,
there's like a teapot on it and.

48e983a8-596e-45de-9fe2-3f621e66d681-0
02:04:34.570 --> 02:04:38.057
I don't know, some other stuff
like a cash register or

48e983a8-596e-45de-9fe2-3f621e66d681-1
02:04:38.057 --> 02:04:39.960
something. And then there's a.

60dbc31b-f30f-4e3a-ae0a-2e973c340eb1-0
02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:44.297
There's two people standing
together. They're holding big

60dbc31b-f30f-4e3a-ae0a-2e973c340eb1-1
02:04:44.297 --> 02:04:46.580
things that look kind of like
eggs.

dbb49a77-b481-4db2-bf5f-94ce39a584d4-0
02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:52.114
And they're taking them out of a
big bin and then in the next

dbb49a77-b481-4db2-bf5f-94ce39a584d4-1
02:04:52.114 --> 02:04:53.290
picture there's.

e3011d53-1fe7-4e3f-a789-ac0cca8863fa-0
02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:55.510
A person.

45f2358e-a0ac-4258-bc55-beb331cf7bbf-0
02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:00.947
Uh, shaving. So there's a
there's a man being shaved and

45f2358e-a0ac-4258-bc55-beb331cf7bbf-1
02:05:00.947 --> 02:05:03.730
then, like a child standing next
to him.

34cc0014-8bae-422c-98d5-e27e34d96d8e-0
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:10.111
And then in the next picture
there's two men playing

34cc0014-8bae-422c-98d5-e27e34d96d8e-1
02:05:10.111 --> 02:05:11.280
instruments.

71029a76-640b-4d8a-a36c-4f4af8897a61-0
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:16.240
And then in the next picture,
there's a group of people.

462d4abd-e9f9-45ee-976b-f2c7f0d5275b-0
02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:21.323
One's holding an animal, one's
got a book, they're all kind of

462d4abd-e9f9-45ee-976b-f2c7f0d5275b-1
02:05:21.323 --> 02:05:25.327
sitting together. And then in
the last picture we've got a man

462d4abd-e9f9-45ee-976b-f2c7f0d5275b-2
02:05:25.327 --> 02:05:29.140
with a hat holding a piece of
luggage. He's wearing a suit.

7115c546-2747-46c9-824a-755d8965b301-0
02:05:31.730 --> 02:05:32.340
Move on.

13bcbf7a-6c5c-42a6-9ff7-05a4bdd8d157-0
02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:39.713
OK, so the man with the hat
looks like it could be the same

13bcbf7a-6c5c-42a6-9ff7-05a4bdd8d157-1
02:05:39.713 --> 02:05:43.612
man from the story from earlier.
He's holding like a a pocket

13bcbf7a-6c5c-42a6-9ff7-05a4bdd8d157-2
02:05:43.612 --> 02:05:47.448
watch and he's looking at the
time and then he's holding the

13bcbf7a-6c5c-42a6-9ff7-05a4bdd8d157-3
02:05:47.448 --> 02:05:50.970
pocket watch and kind of looking
away and then there's.

96701ffb-4ea7-4279-9d5f-e6688702f847-0
02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:52.960
Some kind of.

77402f50-8a5a-4eb6-97da-e47440fd0696-0
02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:57.160
I don't know what that is in the
next picture.

56b76397-386f-41e8-a23e-017921c9625c-0
02:05:59.030 --> 02:06:02.886
It's got some kinda just. It's
like a, I don't know, something

56b76397-386f-41e8-a23e-017921c9625c-1
02:06:02.886 --> 02:06:06.743
that's got a design on it. And
then the next picture there's a

56b76397-386f-41e8-a23e-017921c9625c-2
02:06:06.743 --> 02:06:10.416
man walking with a piece of
luggage. There's people walking

56b76397-386f-41e8-a23e-017921c9625c-3
02:06:10.416 --> 02:06:14.089
past him and he's walking,
walking. Now he's looking around

56b76397-386f-41e8-a23e-017921c9625c-4
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:15.130
and there's like.

e31272b1-bb01-4765-8bc7-32b5e115a0e9-0
02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:20.117
Lighted bubbles around him. And
now he sees one of the bubbles

e31272b1-bb01-4765-8bc7-32b5e115a0e9-1
02:06:20.117 --> 02:06:24.427
and he's got like his finger up
to it, like he's like looking at

e31272b1-bb01-4765-8bc7-32b5e115a0e9-2
02:06:24.427 --> 02:06:28.472
it. And now his hat flies off
and all the lights are kind of

e31272b1-bb01-4765-8bc7-32b5e115a0e9-3
02:06:28.472 --> 02:06:32.716
going in the other direction and
he's going to pick up his hat.

e31272b1-bb01-4765-8bc7-32b5e115a0e9-4
02:06:32.716 --> 02:06:35.170
He puts his hat back on and
there's.

e7117dad-036f-40b3-9a2c-7836547b5f7f-0
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:38.979
I don't know, it might be a map
or something. It's got a whole

e7117dad-036f-40b3-9a2c-7836547b5f7f-1
02:06:38.979 --> 02:06:39.870
bunch of arrows on it.

d5e735bb-1682-41a8-b4d2-a9816e388a94-0
02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:43.240
And he's looking at a book.

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-0
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.546
And then we see the book a
little bit closer. Somebody

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-1
02:06:47.546 --> 02:06:51.673
approaches him from behind. So
he's looking back at the person.

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-2
02:06:51.673 --> 02:06:55.799
He's got the book in his hand in
front of him, and he's looking

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-3
02:06:55.799 --> 02:06:59.733
back at the person behind him.
And now we see a man and he's

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-4
02:06:59.733 --> 02:07:03.472
like holding out his hand to
him, like maybe asking him a

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-5
02:07:03.472 --> 02:07:07.212
question. Now they're both
standing together and they are

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-6
02:07:07.212 --> 02:07:10.823
talking and they're still
talking. And now the original

80eba086-5eac-4e11-b155-455fffd8f28e-7
02:07:10.823 --> 02:07:14.369
man is writing something down in
his book to show him.

6691f5c5-5dc9-4b35-a465-de43a75dd631-0
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:18.068
And he's showing him and it
looks like it's a bed. It's like

6691f5c5-5dc9-4b35-a465-de43a75dd631-1
02:07:18.068 --> 02:07:21.746
a bed with a window. So maybe
he's looking for a room to stay

6691f5c5-5dc9-4b35-a465-de43a75dd631-2
02:07:21.746 --> 02:07:25.483
in. And then the man is, he's
holding up his finger like, yes,

6691f5c5-5dc9-4b35-a465-de43a75dd631-3
02:07:25.483 --> 02:07:29.279
I know. And then he's pointing
in a direction to show him where

6691f5c5-5dc9-4b35-a465-de43a75dd631-4
02:07:29.279 --> 02:07:33.016
to go. And now he's like leading
him and he's got an animal on

6691f5c5-5dc9-4b35-a465-de43a75dd631-5
02:07:33.016 --> 02:07:34.440
his back. #END_arrival_3

f6269a72-6ae7-422d-9b9c-a415feb51c4d-0
02:07:35.490 --> 02:07:36.370
Come on.

4d744c75-6b9f-48b6-ba65-f8f5abe8c4de-0
02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:52.360
OK, next is our last complex

02:12:20.050 --> 02:12:22.473
And then we move on there's a
bunch of little pictures. So we

998bd25a-7bf7-4a42-84cc-24960f468591-1

animal with a big long tail and

02a004be-3ba6-486c-9dfa-8e55beaefd7d-2

There there's two hands on the
basket. It looks like it's

food, and then they're chopping

60ffda67-92c3-42e0-9d6e-26e2ab5df58e-2
02:13:40.786 --> 02:13:42.830

02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:07.369
It's like they're sitting down
for dinner. So it's the two men,

e378f144-1f41-42e6-909f-aef36a76415e-1

laughing and then we've got a
man in the vest looks like

f95f6992-a1b9-499a-8f69-4fd387b54b35-3
02:14:26.693 --> 02:14:30.151
probably the man from the story
earlier. He's smiling and

f95f6992-a1b9-499a-8f69-4fd387b54b35-4
02:14:30.151 --> 02:14:33.846
laughing too, like they're all
having a really good time. The

f95f6992-a1b9-499a-8f69-4fd387b54b35-5
02:14:33.846 --> 02:14:37.423

02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:46.312
It's not a flute, but it's
that's probably the closest

b2574ed5-2ec5-4d6f-8159-444ffd3b5a25-1
02:14:46.312 --> 02:14:50.055
thing. It's a flute like
instrument, and then the little

b2574ed5-2ec5-4d6f-8159-444ffd3b5a25-2
02:14:50.055 --> 02:14:53.930

02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:57.804
the man in the vest has some
sort of paper. He's making it

b2574ed5-2ec5-4d6f-8159-444ffd3b5a25-4
02:14:57.804 --> 02:14:58.790

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:02.400
Looks like a fox. He gives it to
the little.

69bccdd5-e1a4-4a25-99e5-be5747299139-0
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:08.090
Boy. And then the man with the
glasses is putting away.

d1d5bf73-dd5c-4b33-b6da-53828fd7b7f3-0
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:12.626
some sort of a bowl, and the man
and the woman are standing with

d1d5bf73-dd5c-4b33-b6da-53828fd7b7f3-1
02:15:12.626 --> 02:15:16.020

02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:18.340
bowl. We just see the hands in
the bowl.

e41f61a6-61c5-4b17-aec2-8ef444f9aba2-0
02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:19.910
We can move on.

7f715c44-2d9c-4db0-b959-659f47f8d80d-0
02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:28.870
So we see the bowl just sitting
on like a shelf.

106be496-c745-44a4-8827-e5f8e2c56f23-0
02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:33.285
And then we're further away, and
then through a window. And then

106be496-c745-44a4-8827-e5f8e2c56f23-1
02:15:33.285 --> 02:15:33.650

02:15:47.916 --> 02:15:51.585
he's cutting some sort of food
and then he's feeding the

0a5762bf-f55a-45b2-8b73-a76812f181ac-4
02:15:51.585 --> 02:15:55.446

table like eating breakfast and

0a5762bf-f55a-45b2-8b73-a76812f181ac-5
02:15:55.446 --> 02:15:59.115

he's putting on, he's got a
