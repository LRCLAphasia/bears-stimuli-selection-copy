2dbcaab1-5844-4332-b41b-d3ce9d6fee68-0
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.022
OK, so this is like what we've
been doing in the last session.

2dbcaab1-5844-4332-b41b-d3ce9d6fee68-1
00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:09.804
So this is a complex theme. So
just describe what you see and

2dbcaab1-5844-4332-b41b-d3ce9d6fee68-2
00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:13.525
what you see happening and I'm
going to make it a little bit

2dbcaab1-5844-4332-b41b-d3ce9d6fee68-3
00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:14.440
bigger for you.

f1745905-4d5f-4940-ae92-29955aa39a8e-0
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.343
Thank you, no problem. And like
before you have approximately

f1745905-4d5f-4940-ae92-29955aa39a8e-1
00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:22.760
like 3/3 to 5 minutes drive so.

8f690c9d-c094-4700-bdcf-0edc7c96e0c4-0
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.270
OK.

82d4cd69-730f-480c-bcc1-2fc8aa340ecd-0
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.450
#START_wild_west So we're
looking at.

bbc621a6-7cc8-43eb-8f84-9d350b8eddba-0
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.670
Like an Old West Village.

3b2a7f2c-03e1-4691-8507-02eb5da37cc0-0
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.530
Or Old West town.

2588a450-b4cb-4d52-acd8-69492c7caf45-0
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.810
So there's a lot of buildings, a
lot of people. There's a jail.

81434b0d-cba1-4316-915a-aa8fd6967205-0
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.230
With the sheriff sign on it,
there's a two-story hotel.

13c2913b-427c-48a1-b19f-d7391e81d4f1-0
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.410
And next to it is a is a
two-story saloon.

f3ad8372-3f2b-4dfd-a8b6-00593ca70acf-0
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330
And then a general store.

91169344-72ed-4839-ba5b-b73761d3f0b5-0
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.060
You can also see a bank.

961956d2-b2e8-4aaa-82f6-9bb5d420bd6e-0
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.810
And a livery stable.

0ea67344-13db-4468-a52e-8202c771b93d-0
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.890
So some of the people that you
can see.

6bc2f6cf-2d09-4ef2-9e5e-27ae9e4fd0ca-0
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.460
By the jail.

dfccf789-0bbd-4f26-8856-0c750dab2683-0
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.530
You can see wanted posters on
the side of the building.

b7a81a4c-5b93-4030-833a-484e24602c87-0
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.294
And there's people hanging out
in front of the jail with cowboy

b7a81a4c-5b93-4030-833a-484e24602c87-1
00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:30.950
hats and cowboy boots.

e42a81fe-b650-463b-afcc-4e9cc551f746-0
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.900
There are people on top of the
jail building.

722be15c-6c40-4894-8dd6-02463637375e-0
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.720
With a chimney coming out of the
roof.

2555f6ab-db08-48fe-956e-855ff05b8cf0-0
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.994
And it looks like one of the
prisoners is trying to escape

2555f6ab-db08-48fe-956e-855ff05b8cf0-1
00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:50.318
through the chimney he has on a
yellow and black striped top,

2555f6ab-db08-48fe-956e-855ff05b8cf0-2
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:54.362
and he's probably stuck in the
chimney with just his arms

2555f6ab-db08-48fe-956e-855ff05b8cf0-3
00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:55.130
coming out.

3c8f6f72-7c18-4691-90b9-f822f26f1602-0
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.750
In the two-story hotel next
door, you can see.

ddff5532-a6d2-4bb5-be8d-ce72ccaaab84-0
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.550
On the second floor.

a476c18f-d2e6-428d-abfd-736cda80d0b5-0
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.919
It looks like maybe there's a
gunfight taking place between

a476c18f-d2e6-428d-abfd-736cda80d0b5-1
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.040
two people.

c4e28c40-5a18-4f7f-ac78-62986677f01b-0
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.559
One is kind of backing up, but
it looks like he just shot the

c4e28c40-5a18-4f7f-ac78-62986677f01b-1
00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:24.136
gun and white smoke is coming
out and he's fighting against

c4e28c40-5a18-4f7f-ac78-62986677f01b-2
00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:26.730
somebody in a yellow outfit
with.

fec5cc6c-e1fb-4367-aa4f-5814d2bbbf36-0
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.500
Brown cowboy boots and a blue
cowboy hat.

7cf17a4c-f293-4fcc-9135-e28686748439-0
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.106
You can see a chair is
overturned, so they must have

7cf17a4c-f293-4fcc-9135-e28686748439-1
00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:39.307
been fighting. All sorts of
things are are strewn on the

7cf17a4c-f293-4fcc-9135-e28686748439-2
00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:39.750
floor.

2eb5f6bb-d1cd-4769-b5ff-cfb007be0b7b-0
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.930
In the saloon next next to the
hotel and the general store.

7c1b636b-f97a-4ef7-b0e4-c7046667f06a-0
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.680
On the.

1c664588-f578-42a4-8695-1bec3b762b52-0
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.095
The the porch has a covering.
The porch of the saloon has a

1c664588-f578-42a4-8695-1bec3b762b52-1
00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:01.667
covering a roof over it, and you
can see two people standing on

1c664588-f578-42a4-8695-1bec3b762b52-2
00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.310
top of that roof outside the
saloon.

a88d5191-c9b9-4e42-8814-b03e8ec42ed2-0
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.910
And.

d0259ea1-5c6e-4703-ba9c-586f3aba49c3-0
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.824
It looks like they have ropes in
their hands or or bags. I'm not

d0259ea1-5c6e-4703-ba9c-586f3aba49c3-1
00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:15.280
sure if they stole something.

f6e71c09-0189-4448-b765-f4ff0fa16da2-0
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.910
Little bit hard to see that.

2f0e6520-ce6d-463b-bcc0-c8a6a7e92eaf-0
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.048
Um, there's also a second saloon
called the Pioneer Saloon, and

2f0e6520-ce6d-463b-bcc0-c8a6a7e92eaf-1
00:03:25.048 --> 00:03:27.380
it's a blue building with
yellow.

cdbc9b85-10e7-4f05-8683-9446b8cb9c2e-0
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.143
Lettering. And there's people
standing on the front porch of

cdbc9b85-10e7-4f05-8683-9446b8cb9c2e-1
00:03:33.143 --> 00:03:38.402
the second story, and they have
musical instruments, so you can

cdbc9b85-10e7-4f05-8683-9446b8cb9c2e-2
00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:42.430
see a lot of people have guitars
in their hands.

bd2a167f-c031-47a2-9a78-e9dabb016f02-0
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.675
Oh no, those aren't musical
instruments. Those are bags of

bd2a167f-c031-47a2-9a78-e9dabb016f02-1
00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:51.180
money and they're all robbers.
And they have.

d06e4885-e7b3-48b8-8620-ffc8706506fb-0
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.000
Masks covering their face.

c551fee5-1b34-4dcb-83b3-7f6bc30cae86-0
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.630
And they stole from the bank
next door, so they're running

c551fee5-1b34-4dcb-83b3-7f6bc30cae86-1
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.550
away very happy with all the
bags of of money.

ee32cbd2-99f2-4c15-ac55-14d52db97bd3-0
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.730
Let's see.

917bc83b-d4f6-42c7-9b93-decfbe921a3c-0
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.804
There's there's actually a third
saloon, lots of saloons in this

917bc83b-d4f6-42c7-9b93-decfbe921a3c-1
00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:21.252
town. It's called the one more
saloon, another blue building

917bc83b-d4f6-42c7-9b93-decfbe921a3c-2
00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:26.699
with yellow writing. And it's
also a two-story building. And

917bc83b-d4f6-42c7-9b93-decfbe921a3c-3
00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.057
on the second story there's a
deck coming out over the over

917bc83b-d4f6-42c7-9b93-decfbe921a3c-4
00:04:32.057 --> 00:04:37.505
the first story and they have a
wheeled cannon up on the 2nd

917bc83b-d4f6-42c7-9b93-decfbe921a3c-5
00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:39.469
floor of the building.

07fa1d11-4ae0-40a0-a605-7780d6cc3b3e-0
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.933
And it looks like a robber with
a red mask over his face has a

07fa1d11-4ae0-40a0-a605-7780d6cc3b3e-1
00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:48.060
gun to another person holding
him up.

22382cf0-4d08-4271-a04e-3547fb0988e6-0
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.138
In front of that saloon is a
railroad track, and there's a

22382cf0-4d08-4271-a04e-3547fb0988e6-1
00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:56.160
red engine.

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-0
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.568
With a #2 on the front and white
smoke coming out of it on the

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-1
00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:05.959
railroad tracks and right in
front of the train there is a

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-2
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.424
Stagecoach that is stuck on the
railroad tracks. It's a red

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-3
00:05:10.424 --> 00:05:15.038
Stagecoach with people inside
and suitcases on the top. And a

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-4
00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:19.429
lot of people are around the
Stagecoach trying to help get

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-5
00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:23.448
the Stagecoach Stagecoach off of
the railroad tracks.

2c9df156-d5cd-4cce-b14e-37b470f70936-6

efadc5ba-fb63-4516-99f0-f5257580cdf4-0
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.293
That is perfect. So hard to see
them. Yeah, like those aren't

efadc5ba-fb63-4516-99f0-f5257580cdf4-1
00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:35.590
guitars. That's funny.

3125f80f-1b29-4cd7-b388-3d5cde9f18ec-0
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.680
I know so much was going on in
that one.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.600
We have another complex scene.

e5473038-7f33-44ae-97d4-01becea7ae72-0
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.070
And it is.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.930
OK, I'm going to share my screen
again.

95cbd7d0-3452-4e96-a49b-710797a5953e-0
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.636
OK, so same thing as before,
just take 3 to 5 minutes to

95cbd7d0-3452-4e96-a49b-710797a5953e-1
00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:10.280
describe what you see happening
in this scene.

9d916185-44c5-4ae1-9532-4e65442d8a26-0
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.780

you're ready.

916b069b-f14e-4cca-a98d-e6a5f25de891-0

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.761
And there are a lot. There are a
lot of people visiting the zoo

dac45081-3b95-4409-9f80-661007137486-1
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:26.820

animals. You can see uh two

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.180
And a hippopotamus.

26fe00ba-6b89-4c52-b25b-2dc47ba84ab4-0
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.770

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.308
Polar bears and there's a
rhinoceros who has escaped and

331ac947-4737-464c-93db-523087db6001-1
00:06:43.308 --> 00:06:47.030
is running down the pathway
where all the people are.

5b54a7cc-02d8-4b07-8059-fc158055f8d6-0
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.429
The rhinoceros has a smile on
his face and thinks it's funny,

5b54a7cc-02d8-4b07-8059-fc158055f8d6-1
00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:55.087
but all the people around him
are very scared and scared looks

5b54a7cc-02d8-4b07-8059-fc158055f8d6-2
00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:57.990

running away from him.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.590
There's.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.831
Also a snake that is in front of
the rhinoceros. The snake must

09c4d830-564d-4f61-a8ca-ff2bdd2da137-1
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.770
have escaped and the snake is
green and yellow and has a

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.984
scared look on his face with his
eyes real big and his mouth

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.711
There's a food vendor selling
hot dogs, the carts Gray, and it

9f13a432-6d70-45b1-b350-02cf30fc845f-1

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.469
And the vendor has a dark
mustache and a yellow shirt with

318e8e0f-e10c-49f3-a3dc-fafe3e618698-1
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.620
a white apron. He's got a hot
dog in his hand, and he's about

318e8e0f-e10c-49f3-a3dc-fafe3e618698-2
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.972
to hand it to a customer who has
a white shirt and blue pants, a

318e8e0f-e10c-49f3-a3dc-fafe3e618698-3
00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:42.055

And he's handing the money to

318e8e0f-e10c-49f3-a3dc-fafe3e618698-4
00:07:42.055 --> 00:07:44.599
the vendor so he can get his hot
dog.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.426
Some of the people who are
walking around are uh a family

fda8af22-4818-4933-a53e-06399d484569-1
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:53.610
pushing a red stroller with a
baby in it.

7c14d2a7-b1fe-4e99-95bd-b5511a5e379d-0
00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:00.350
There's an animal catcher with a
net he's probably running to try

7c14d2a7-b1fe-4e99-95bd-b5511a5e379d-1
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.420
to catch the rhinoceros.

c36bdd1a-4423-4dc3-9cda-b8dfe45e00b6-0
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.100
With the net.

59de55a7-f35d-4332-9c98-db36822c6def-0
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.760
Um, there.

0430f51b-0a2d-42cf-b4ee-4ac7d4c52407-0
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.630
Are.

25163758-b760-4070-8c13-1447541d3bac-0
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.480
Trees around, so there's tall.

b2090a8b-6a20-41a1-8a54-4e0bdd6cdb75-0
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.468
Trees with a lot of green leaves
on it, with raccoons in the tree

b2090a8b-6a20-41a1-8a54-4e0bdd6cdb75-1
00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:23.680
looking down at all the people.

6a60e075-2ef8-42d2-9702-3f14174f4e2e-0
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.945
There's an ice cream stand and
the ice cream stand looks like

6a60e075-2ef8-42d2-9702-3f14174f4e2e-1
00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:29.830
an ice cream cone.

0bc99a43-d63e-44fa-b45a-6d3520634f24-0
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.886
So the bottom of it is brown
like the ice cream cone, and the

0bc99a43-d63e-44fa-b45a-6d3520634f24-1
00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:37.248
top is pink with ice cream with
an ice cream sign on it. And

0bc99a43-d63e-44fa-b45a-6d3520634f24-2
00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:40.499
then there's a window where
people can walk up and get ice

0bc99a43-d63e-44fa-b45a-6d3520634f24-3
00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:44.137
cream cones. So there's a little
boy in a green shirt reaching up

0bc99a43-d63e-44fa-b45a-6d3520634f24-4
00:08:44.137 --> 00:08:45.570
to get his ice cream cone.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.612
There's another area that has
the giraffes and antelope,

cca9c719-6ce3-44a5-a112-cb17d5b70c66-1
00:08:53.612 --> 00:08:54.430
anteaters.

4555bfe8-7e2a-4ba7-b9a2-1f0c9c9ac4c0-0
00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:01.296
And there's a boy who is looking
at the animals, leaning over the

4555bfe8-7e2a-4ba7-b9a2-1f0c9c9ac4c0-1
00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:02.330
the railing.

48bfc481-9880-4577-9289-dd18418173d1-0
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.870
And he's dumping his bag of
chips into the animal pen.

b5866529-7944-4d0a-a6e7-b654380bece1-0
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.910
Flying above the animal pen is a

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.606
A propeller airplane with Red
Wings and a Penguin is the

d1572197-1382-4371-af13-6057a9759cdf-1
00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:20.150
pilot.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:26.137
There's also a blue, yellow and
green bird flying next to the

81c4e80f-acf4-4a71-ab9e-5f34d6a58edf-1
00:09:26.137 --> 00:09:26.850
airplane.

2f6157cc-7e06-45b6-a9af-adf83cf60d51-0
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.610
There is a shop in the in the.

f5622ae2-dbdb-4d47-91a6-1bdc9273b934-0
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.480
In the back along the pathway.

19bba22f-06ca-4b61-a5da-e02395b7dcf5-0
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.044
That has people coming in and
out shopping. It's got a brown

19bba22f-06ca-4b61-a5da-e02395b7dcf5-1
00:09:43.044 --> 00:09:47.737
roof with yellow and blue siding
and a yellow sign up front that

19bba22f-06ca-4b61-a5da-e02395b7dcf5-2
00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:48.460
says shop.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.139
And then next to it is another
building of the same color, blue

66333656-ef25-46fb-aea5-b6ab158de9bb-1
00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:56.730
front, yellow sides and a sign
on the front that says Cafe.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.714
Way beyond the zoo, in the
background you can see a lot of

4b881a69-b832-40ea-b7ce-32f2ffa3c2ef-1
00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:18.310
green trees and in the far back.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.315
You can barely see a city, so
there's tall skyscrapers in the

305c9d15-b3af-4b20-a413-0f3ca93175b5-1
00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:24.300

4cc48bcc-d0e5-4806-bcbf-79c13c854284-0
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.922
Goodness, I don't know what else
to describe. And, well, that's

4cc48bcc-d0e5-4806-bcbf-79c13c854284-1
00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:46.370
that's perfect. OK, now let me
see what we got next.

1bd89b89-58b6-4c8f-8925-7f37cd16fab9-0
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.510
OK.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.110
OK, next we have a story.

4a158a00-02b4-4200-b155-2c666d58695a-0
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.580
Let me pull up the story.

f0da8b5f-b60b-4c88-bf92-e39ca1694540-0
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.740
OK, so this story.

988e6b10-bbc2-4dc3-a9d2-757ab1cc33fd-0
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.830
Is.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.240
OK, so this story is
approximately 44 slides long, so

4659f17f-3e46-406a-9366-23d0759c066f-1
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.793
you could take between like 10
to 15 minutes to describe it.

4659f17f-3e46-406a-9366-23d0759c066f-2
00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:27.644
And like before with the stories
you could just tell me when you

4659f17f-3e46-406a-9366-23d0759c066f-3
00:11:27.644 --> 00:11:32.197
would like me to move on with
the slides and I will share my

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.620
And I will put this into.

#START_wanderer OK, we start out
our story with a very large

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.261
White piece of paper with two
people in it. One person has a

35ea065b-0ed3-4381-943b-c5bf28269ba8-1
00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:24.385
striped shirt and dark pants and
everything's Gray and black.

00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:27.030
There's no color in the picture.

ec7a2866-a908-4114-ba88-8bfeb32ae850-0
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.194
The other person in the picture
is dressed in a costume with

ec7a2866-a908-4114-ba88-8bfeb32ae850-1
00:12:32.194 --> 00:12:34.290

like white stripes on it and on
his head His head is covered in

a30577e1-5788-434f-87d7-f31760d849b8-1
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:45.080
a black mask, and he has.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.850
Two horns coming out, one from
either side of his head.

9fb904cb-1b56-4ed4-a372-4f8d39a321e9-0
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.620
They are folding the piece of
paper.

4e32d1d3-54cd-4a99-95ba-b11cd2154d4b-0
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.550
And they have folded it into the
shape of a of a boat.

73fe66f8-66b6-4ca5-a735-1fd2ed24db19-0
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.518
The next scene is a very large
boat that looks kind of like a

73fe66f8-66b6-4ca5-a735-1fd2ed24db19-1
00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:07.560
pirate ship.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.329
But on the back of the pirate
ship it looks like a a house or

a4ded5b2-8c06-4e74-b7bc-6630cc143687-1
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:19.284
a castle on the very back and
underneath the boat that's

a4ded5b2-8c06-4e74-b7bc-6630cc143687-2
00:13:19.284 --> 00:13:24.152
floating in the water, you can
see a large round object

a4ded5b2-8c06-4e74-b7bc-6630cc143687-3
00:13:24.152 --> 00:13:29.194
attached to the boat that looks
like the old scuba diving

a4ded5b2-8c06-4e74-b7bc-6630cc143687-4
00:13:29.194 --> 00:13:29.890

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.612
And in front of it, floating on
the water, is the teeny tiny

76408afe-9588-4634-a1c9-9d6abe748980-1
00:13:43.612 --> 00:13:46.540
paper boat that was folded by
the two men.

birds with black tips on their
wings. And in the water below

There's also birds flying up
above the boat and there's a

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:40.636
Now coming up out of the water
much bigger than the White Paper

4c08fd9d-30b9-41d2-9ec0-a0eef65b0e73-1

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:57.140
into the coral reef, so there's
a lot of growth and vegetation.

And a lot of coral coral reef, a
lot growing up, some of it looks

1bb62f03-04aa-4859-8b16-66c0833af51e-1
00:16:22.343 --> 00:16:27.870
like fingers growing up, some of
it looks like just poofs of.

can still see the paper boat

021e270f-1852-4d14-8ccb-977ef80ac6f2-2
00:16:40.062 --> 00:16:40.620

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.728
Again, you can see the paper
boat floating on the water, and

ca6985ec-0d43-481a-876e-8f674889b616-1
00:16:51.728 --> 00:16:55.150

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:08.072
Have their head looks just like
a fish floating, but then they

2f85e92e-4d6d-40ff-ba5a-e557af7c7615-1

Growing out the bottom and those
two fish are kissing each other.

8c48278a-0b7b-4cfe-8710-93f653cea7a3-0
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.960

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.660

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.737
The paper boat is still floating
on the water and in front of it

72146db7-321b-4e85-8820-e0701bf9c7ba-1
00:17:47.737 --> 00:17:49.090

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.120

00:18:06.832 --> 00:18:10.940
looks like it's also a paper
boat that's folded.

9ed6eca7-55ed-4eb4-ab7f-b1e76d6dc790-0
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.040
Underneath the water you can see
the fish standing on some coral.

49fa265c-0baa-4289-92bc-6b26ffa72379-0
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.470

Paper boat which is still
floating on top of the water is

da2a20aa-d155-4e66-8533-3327b5469a15-1
00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:40.262
a long snake. Looks like a long
snake coming out from the deck

da2a20aa-d155-4e66-8533-3327b5469a15-2
00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:45.070

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.412
The snake is kind of wrapped
around in odd looking fish

3a57a121-ff05-4a10-a1cf-1cc16c324dbd-1
00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:54.580

8529bac7-4a4a-447e-8576-ddcb7fc1eaf3-0
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.540
That look like Stingrays, so
they're flat fish.

0b5ecaf9-75f3-4908-85c6-6603811a6e20-0
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.560

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.724
OK, we can still see the water
with the paper, small paper boat

2301b17c-0c6c-4811-9de8-ec4d76febc09-1

Horn. Or maybe it's a fishing
pole with a line hanging down

c828a9a7-4f6f-41e6-93a7-63b0ba9076b7-0
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.620
Birds flying in the sky, some,
couple birds and then one that

c828a9a7-4f6f-41e6-93a7-63b0ba9076b7-1
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.610
looks like a bat.

6d5828c4-1fb9-4d85-ab90-36c77398569f-0
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.914
And then it looks like there's
some that are flying around that

6d5828c4-1fb9-4d85-ab90-36c77398569f-1
00:29:28.914 --> 00:29:32.256
look like fish, so you can see
the back end of the fish and

6d5828c4-1fb9-4d85-ab90-36c77398569f-2
00:29:32.256 --> 00:29:33.370
their and their fin.

37c9314f-cde1-4239-8c01-b1c280d8ff56-0
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:34.960
or their tail.

04269139-5559-4fc4-b428-63e5b71e6187-0
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.690
OK.

12807510-5f05-473a-aae5-721a683247c7-0
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.487
Now it's dark out, so in the you
can still see the water, and

12807510-5f05-473a-aae5-721a683247c7-1
00:29:47.487 --> 00:29:52.244
floating on the water is our
white paper boat. And in the sky

12807510-5f05-473a-aae5-721a683247c7-2
00:29:52.244 --> 00:29:55.620
the sky is very dark with many,
many stars.

eb9331f9-bc62-473d-89b9-854faf50b443-0
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:03.345
Along with the moon. The moon
isn't a big ball though. It's

eb9331f9-bc62-473d-89b9-854faf50b443-1
00:30:03.345 --> 00:30:07.020
just a small, curved Crescent
moon.

8c9f11bb-d5c9-463d-8fec-2798ae5e59f6-0
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:16.225
Under the water you can see a
lot of fish right underneath the

8c9f11bb-d5c9-463d-8fec-2798ae5e59f6-1
00:30:16.225 --> 00:30:21.220
boat that's floating, and the
fish's eyes are glowing bright.

57891c27-fccd-45df-ad83-36e375eb5ebe-0
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.822
So when you see this picture, it
looks the same above and below.

57891c27-fccd-45df-ad83-36e375eb5ebe-1
00:30:26.822 --> 00:30:31.632
So above are the bright stars
and below are the bright eyes of

57891c27-fccd-45df-ad83-36e375eb5ebe-2
00:30:31.632 --> 00:30:32.320
the fish.

2ae32492-dd6f-4355-a7ef-a523347415a0-0
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.060
So the paper boat is still on
the water.

2e8872a3-e1d9-42b7-a632-1edef552b0d6-0
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.306
But surrounded. Completely
surrounded. Surrounding the boat

2e8872a3-e1d9-42b7-a632-1edef552b0d6-1
00:30:46.306 --> 00:30:51.069
now, fish have come up out of
the water, just their heads, and

2e8872a3-e1d9-42b7-a632-1edef552b0d6-2
00:30:51.069 --> 00:30:55.378
they're looking, all looking
towards the boat. They have

2e8872a3-e1d9-42b7-a632-1edef552b0d6-3
00:30:55.378 --> 00:30:59.310
their mouths open and their eyes
are glowing white.

9243f0eb-2964-4a9a-9b6c-253fb63d1d56-0
00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.003
The White Paper boat is still
floating on the water and the

9243f0eb-2964-4a9a-9b6c-253fb63d1d56-1
00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:16.070
and coming in and out of the
water are a few fish.

e39c16fc-c049-4c73-afdb-18c2857cca75-0
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.011
One fish has his head up out of
the water and he has the bright

e39c16fc-c049-4c73-afdb-18c2857cca75-1
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:21.840
glowing eyes.

3c4cc3bb-a9d6-405c-b0bb-1cfd836b7a8d-0
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.570
The sky is still very dark with.

b787dab7-b9b7-4d94-9749-31d417c610e2-0
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.180
With many stars.

51c46516-83d4-45ca-8489-9a038dc390e4-0
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:35.142
And it looks kind of like the
Northern Lights up in the sky

51c46516-83d4-45ca-8489-9a038dc390e4-1
00:31:35.142 --> 00:31:36.940
and it looks like.

da9f4542-ae6d-4851-adbd-8d722706593b-0
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:45.782
A ribbon wound around up in the
sky with light lighter colored

da9f4542-ae6d-4851-adbd-8d722706593b-1
00:31:45.782 --> 00:31:46.520
lights.

b94d12e8-b3eb-4ef6-957d-145d1fe91875-0
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.730
Bright lights and medium colored
lights.

2e26dca4-2958-4882-b122-895ffb0d647b-0
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.830
With stars shining through them.

d6e801ad-a8e5-4aee-b178-fdb0aebad55f-0
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.730
The paper boat is still on the
water.

082d380b-ffb9-4a07-a400-e57323e35f39-0
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.750
And you can still see the waves
in the water.

a815fc99-a9cb-415f-ab96-67e7dc4428ea-0
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.318
And there's no animals around.
The only thing you can see is

a815fc99-a9cb-415f-ab96-67e7dc4428ea-1
00:32:11.318 --> 00:32:11.910
the water,

488cbaba-6ec3-4dbe-b665-0945d11078ac-0
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.850
The White Paper boat, and a very
large iceberg.

03005210-0e89-491f-8f24-a887461c8dc5-0
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.230
Iceberg is white on the top.

96ddaf6c-2fde-449f-970d-e402ce697860-0
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.670
and front. and

522d6b42-a57d-4e4d-b9cd-9dbb341bcc5f-0
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.170
Kind of grayish on the side.

52050777-ee53-4b1e-95f9-861f26abbdb0-0
00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.148
The boats in the water and it's
surrounded by little bits of the

52050777-ee53-4b1e-95f9-861f26abbdb0-1
00:32:41.148 --> 00:32:43.350
iceberg that are in the water.

13f3e8b1-1072-430a-949a-1fdb4ac0ebe4-0
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.920
Called bergy bits.

b5537f2b-48a6-4a69-9031-7ce96b95a1b2-0
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.365
And the boat is coming up
towards the iceberg and there's

b5537f2b-48a6-4a69-9031-7ce96b95a1b2-1
00:32:51.365 --> 00:32:53.890
an opening, kind of like a cave.

b36ee01f-95a8-41b5-a895-48e1d8010a92-0
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.540
So the boat has floated in the
water inside the.

6bf41d1a-305c-4b5c-a681-7f02834ae8b1-0
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.830
Cave of the iceberg.

243eb145-3ca9-4b64-b327-5a714db2c305-0
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.880
So the boat is.

62cea306-557a-4aa8-aef2-6e66fd41bbfb-0
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.870
I think back outside of the
iceberg.

13dd1aff-1813-439a-adc3-1061ef45ce19-0
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.860
Right up to the edge of the
iceberg.

ee765057-9a3c-484e-8b96-974ca6b4afcc-0
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.630
And.

5ac36f28-a7b4-4580-9c72-84dd55a94f2e-0
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.980
Coming up out of the water.

14b5553f-0eba-4a7b-94c9-c6b58089962d-0
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:36.894
Is like a snake, but instead of
the head of the snake it looks

14b5553f-0eba-4a7b-94c9-c6b58089962d-1
00:33:36.894 --> 00:33:38.280
like a like a.

bd3e59d8-0207-4f29-ae45-deca26375bdd-0
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.720
Megaphone.

a7d1f2e6-5635-40a8-8858-6fdc30215953-0
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.070
Kind of, shining a very bright
light.

b9883aee-da47-49dd-b16b-5dc54cf07e3f-0
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.690
In the next picture.

ffd14e4e-6675-456e-89ec-c5c08484f3e1-0
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.350
Coming up out of the water is a.

f3685984-2707-4113-a3c5-65e1667b7a8c-0
00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:03.672
Monster that looks like it's in
a scuba diving outfit. So it has

f3685984-2707-4113-a3c5-65e1667b7a8c-1
00:34:03.672 --> 00:34:10.823
a helmet on it and coming up out
of the helmet is like a a hose

f3685984-2707-4113-a3c5-65e1667b7a8c-2
00:34:10.823 --> 00:34:12.500
or an air hose.

3fa7ffeb-6527-44de-93c9-e24224d54543-0
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.478
Coming out of where the mouth is
of the helmet are also hoses

3fa7ffeb-6527-44de-93c9-e24224d54543-1
00:34:18.478 --> 00:34:21.450
that go over his shoulder into
his.

0131eadf-6d1c-4970-abe2-d2d974e2c9f5-0
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:23.800
Scuba tank.

e29b78bc-a576-4d82-93d9-beb3ca5c55c1-0
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:33.102
The monster has arms but no
hands, and it looks like where

e29b78bc-a576-4d82-93d9-beb3ca5c55c1-1
00:34:33.102 --> 00:34:38.600
the hands are are fish, the tail
of fish.

770a27fd-07b8-44ee-8644-8f1d6e71ee99-0
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.790
Umm.

db46ad86-ba46-409f-b753-e3d4f232f2cf-0
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:48.396
The monster also has a belt
around him, probably with scuba

db46ad86-ba46-409f-b753-e3d4f232f2cf-1
00:34:48.396 --> 00:34:49.770
diving weights.

7d7cf58e-c3b6-4b10-81a3-46fab992ea57-0
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:03.239
The paper boat is still floating
on the water with the waves, but

7d7cf58e-c3b6-4b10-81a3-46fab992ea57-1
00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:06.810
it has come upon a very large
ocean liner.

4feff5c3-d2a2-48cd-8492-a95fd1994798-0
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.506
This ocean liner is much taller
than the small boat, and it has

4feff5c3-d2a2-48cd-8492-a95fd1994798-1
00:35:12.506 --> 00:35:16.670
smokestacks on top of it with a
lot of dark puffs of smoke

4feff5c3-d2a2-48cd-8492-a95fd1994798-2
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.870
coming out of it.

5705afb3-bfce-4b92-a54d-bfc553779490-0
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.690
The very front of the ocean
liner.

66575a7f-0e52-42cb-82a9-beafe1fdf1fb-0
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.467
Has an has anchors hanging off
either side of the very front,

66575a7f-0e52-42cb-82a9-beafe1fdf1fb-1
00:35:28.467 --> 00:35:31.940
but the anchors are not down in
the water.

23f5597e-c040-4270-af5e-7256ab5fbee0-0
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.170
It's now night time again and
the paper boat is floating in

23f5597e-c040-4270-af5e-7256ab5fbee0-1
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.890
the water.

2163b97a-0c74-4fcb-8253-2ab34d5499bd-0
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:54.130
And there are a lot of white
birds flying up in the sky.

c6087263-42a8-4cdd-a4b5-1b217a69a4f3-0
00:35:54.930 --> 00:36:00.301
As well as down on the water and
one of the white birds is is on

c6087263-42a8-4cdd-a4b5-1b217a69a4f3-1
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:04.350
the paper boat hanging off the
edge of the boat.

94a1119d-c845-4a61-90e7-9a683b231d75-0
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:11.860
In the sky, it looks like puffs
of smoke or cloud dark clouds.

0e1d2549-1021-46f8-9c07-91956c15f8d4-0
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.940
Umm.

c6ef5931-ed52-4d92-af75-1016344abdfd-0
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:19.730
Hmm.

00792033-d56d-4226-85a9-afb4a55d958d-0
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:28.223
Coming up out of the water looks
like kind of an oil rig with

00792033-d56d-4226-85a9-afb4a55d958d-1
00:36:28.223 --> 00:36:33.477
three columns coming up out of
the water with a platform that

00792033-d56d-4226-85a9-afb4a55d958d-2
00:36:33.477 --> 00:36:37.629
has kind of a a house or a
factory on top of it.

89f86e2c-19bc-4302-a558-4ccf01469d4d-0
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:44.260
Coming out of the side are some
cranes and one crane.

d126aa92-6a79-4f28-924f-bb2a6ed163bf-0
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.570
Has a large whale hanging off
the end of the crane.

c4dcd73e-091e-4caa-8011-caaa07d6a6cc-0
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:50.960
There's.

75ec79b2-e32b-4c33-87d9-f0a7dc3a0ee5-0
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.660
A lot of smokestacks on top that
are.

6b28f6a9-6153-4e28-986f-7659ca63830b-0
00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:01.055
Black and white striped and
large puffs of black smoke are

6b28f6a9-6153-4e28-986f-7659ca63830b-1
00:37:01.055 --> 00:37:06.080
coming out of the smokestacks.
Again, flying around in the air

6b28f6a9-6153-4e28-986f-7659ca63830b-2
00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.350
and landed on the water are
white birds.

924e5f09-5f54-406e-81a2-55b59cd76e3e-0
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.750
The White Paper boat is in the
water.

0274d313-496f-47a3-be9b-04af5bbdf391-0
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:31.200
And it's by a large dark column
that's coming up out of the

0274d313-496f-47a3-be9b-04af5bbdf391-1
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:31.850
water.

44f43ea6-d834-4b9d-b748-c61d119a9c92-0
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.714
Probably one of the columns that
was holding up what looked like

44f43ea6-d834-4b9d-b748-c61d119a9c92-1
00:37:36.714 --> 00:37:37.430
the oil rig.

310eb781-8bf5-4df3-acaf-28f067dd7f91-0
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:44.565
And in this column are are
windows, one on top of another

310eb781-8bf5-4df3-acaf-28f067dd7f91-1
00:37:44.565 --> 00:37:50.490
12345 stacked right on top of
each other. The windows are open

310eb781-8bf5-4df3-acaf-28f067dd7f91-2
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.500
and aimed out of each window is.

97bba620-a92e-4ac3-a30a-90ff63a91fe1-0
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.320
Some type of.

106bb3f4-cc4d-4b21-bbfd-220b33e536b3-0
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.240
Animal person.

8116f4c3-b48b-4959-ab61-a83fde29ce13-0
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.370
Shooting guns or lasers down
towards the White Paper boat.

aa223919-beb4-492f-9c7a-9d11353075bb-0
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.280
As well there is a.

2537d9d9-75bf-4334-83d4-af7f4ca27bc4-0
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.310


6eddfa27-1153-4ec8-a008-d928f33ed61f-0
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.350
{Good.}

b54922cc-5e64-42b7-acc2-ef1b2579daf2-0
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:21.195
A kind of boat with a propeller
on the back and the scuba

b54922cc-5e64-42b7-acc2-ef1b2579daf2-1
00:38:21.195 --> 00:38:21.860
diving.

a6334273-ff51-4559-bfcd-da98d0cd2c50-0
00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.580
Looks like a scuba diving person
is.

fdc4df89-0971-4e0b-8c41-61c5e2418cec-0
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.948
Is on it and the white lasers
are shooting down towards him

fdc4df89-0971-4e0b-8c41-61c5e2418cec-1
00:38:30.948 --> 00:38:31.300
also.

ec8965ab-be20-49fb-8e4d-7edbc3d38115-0
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:37.262
Right above him is a very large
claw like device that's hanging

ec8965ab-be20-49fb-8e4d-7edbc3d38115-1
00:38:37.262 --> 00:38:41.080
off of a chain and it's right
above his head.

57c44410-0017-41e7-836a-46d9d9908432-0
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.900
Right by the.

ca76dc9e-0d85-4a59-88e3-6dd88ed591b3-0
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:51.467
White paper boat on the deck of
the boat now is a life round

ca76dc9e-0d85-4a59-88e3-6dd88ed591b3-1
00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:56.419
life preserver and coming up out
of the water is what looks like

ca76dc9e-0d85-4a59-88e3-6dd88ed591b3-2
00:38:56.419 --> 00:39:01.295
a rocket or a rocket ship coming
up out of the water. The front

ca76dc9e-0d85-4a59-88e3-6dd88ed591b3-3
00:39:01.295 --> 00:39:04.190
of it is very cone shaped and
pointy.

2537b40f-1575-4d08-9c93-789036a60e23-0
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.680
And on standing on top of it is.

fc3238ed-e5b8-4c2c-81b4-a134319b3497-0
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.090
A person in a scuba diving
outfit.

5930fcc3-8e57-4a51-b451-74faf8f62ff4-0
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.650
And it looks like he's about to
jump onto the boat.

b019b23f-72df-4708-8383-df8c40d4dad3-0
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:28.092
The White Paper boat now is in
some very large waves and it's

b019b23f-72df-4708-8383-df8c40d4dad3-1
00:39:28.092 --> 00:39:33.734
down at the bottom of a wave and
behind him being towed with a

b019b23f-72df-4708-8383-df8c40d4dad3-2
00:39:33.734 --> 00:39:36.600
rope is the scuba diving person.

d742b8ce-f6d6-41b7-abdb-d045cc2bd7c5-0
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.810
Diver.

b48a3d3e-8fc4-4e0a-a7d9-e733d4cecc5d-0
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.370
In front of them, coming up out
of the water, is a boat full of.

1d6e23ea-3318-4ce3-bf4a-7ad45dbc3821-0
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.254
Animals and Martian looking
people. So there's an animal

1d6e23ea-3318-4ce3-bf4a-7ad45dbc3821-1
00:39:53.254 --> 00:39:57.600
that looks like a a horse. It's
dark with white.

3e43c9d0-b15e-40f8-b19e-9115e0b0ed0c-0
00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:03.120
A lot of white spots on it and
bright white glowing eyes.

0cde7f66-cfad-45e7-9475-c285f78aec26-0
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.066
There's another animal that
looks like a deer or an antelope

0cde7f66-cfad-45e7-9475-c285f78aec26-1
00:40:09.066 --> 00:40:09.490
with.

ebd7ccb7-89a0-4642-825d-3fecda314210-0
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:15.870
Antlers that are very, very tall
antlers coming out of its head.

76d7a6c2-b37a-47c3-93d5-2944edfd5831-0
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.670
The.

fa74ef44-3768-4232-aeb0-cdc986b4c195-0
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.494
Earlier we saw the dark, the
person in the dark costume with

fa74ef44-3768-4232-aeb0-cdc986b4c195-1
00:40:27.494 --> 00:40:29.830
The White Stripes on his chest.

03ddeba9-f70a-492a-83fa-d1fbc9b8fc31-0
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.250
And.

e097ab29-9292-4d7e-9536-738b9655378b-0
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:37.420
He's got white glowing eyes and
a dark mask over his head, but.

526a8f8e-7e8f-4db4-8aea-7fea43f22214-0
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.626
Now we can only see one horn
coming out of his head and he's

526a8f8e-7e8f-4db4-8aea-7fea43f22214-1
00:40:42.626 --> 00:40:44.080
got a dark Cape on him.

f8713a87-79d7-45f2-8e9d-43c3960c7ebe-0
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:53.468
Flying behind the boat, attached
to the boat by string is a very

f8713a87-79d7-45f2-8e9d-43c3960c7ebe-1
00:40:53.468 --> 00:40:56.570
large kite that has stars on it.

7ef52c92-e57a-444f-9022-ad2bd182ee77-0
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:10.393
You can see the White Paper boat
is still in the water, but now

7ef52c92-e57a-444f-9022-ad2bd182ee77-1
00:41:10.393 --> 00:41:14.343
he's stuck in a wave. So this
wave is very, very tall and it's

7ef52c92-e57a-444f-9022-ad2bd182ee77-2
00:41:14.343 --> 00:41:17.980
come up out of the water and
it's curving around like the

7ef52c92-e57a-444f-9022-ad2bd182ee77-3
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.360
wave is crashing down.

572deaea-0285-4127-bb9e-19ebe4b28551-0
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:26.010
And the boat is just on the
inside of the wave.

9e47c121-5957-4016-b793-d7f15a194340-0
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:33.152
There's still the boat with the
animals on it, and the man, or

9e47c121-5957-4016-b793-d7f15a194340-1
00:41:33.152 --> 00:41:38.916
the man in the dark costume with
the horns on his head, is on the

9e47c121-5957-4016-b793-d7f15a194340-2
00:41:38.916 --> 00:41:40.750
very top of the mast.

23e3ecef-33f5-4e2e-8f5a-6e46921c4294-0
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.856
The kite, or you know, it looks
like a kite acting like a sail,

23e3ecef-33f5-4e2e-8f5a-6e46921c4294-1
00:41:46.856 --> 00:41:52.028
is still attached to the boat by
string, but now the kite is

23e3ecef-33f5-4e2e-8f5a-6e46921c4294-2
00:41:52.028 --> 00:41:57.370
ripped in the middle and has a
very big hole. On the crossbars

23e3ecef-33f5-4e2e-8f5a-6e46921c4294-3
00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:02.118
of the kite are two people,
one's hanging on and one is

23e3ecef-33f5-4e2e-8f5a-6e46921c4294-4
00:42:02.118 --> 00:42:07.460
standing on the top. On one of
the lines leading from the boat

23e3ecef-33f5-4e2e-8f5a-6e46921c4294-5
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.530
to the kite is a black cat
walking on the line.

ae2e8855-603b-4525-8002-a20516801715-0
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.798
Now the waves have died down,
but there's still some waves on

ae2e8855-603b-4525-8002-a20516801715-1
00:42:23.798 --> 00:42:27.980
the water and you can see the
White Paper boat floating.

9a1bca62-9b5d-4ea1-98f1-0ca5d1d4d58b-0
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:29.940
And.

b5026756-81a9-45be-9212-5e05cc9795d9-0
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.152
It looks like a storm in the
background. There are a lot of

b5026756-81a9-45be-9212-5e05cc9795d9-1
00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:39.018
clouds and coming down from the
cloud hitting the water is a

b5026756-81a9-45be-9212-5e05cc9795d9-2
00:42:39.018 --> 00:42:40.539
large bolt of lightning.

04bdfe4e-2314-413e-a96e-a318d443062d-0
00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:48.145
Now flying above the water, it
looks like a paper airplane is

04bdfe4e-2314-413e-a96e-a318d443062d-1
00:42:48.145 --> 00:42:48.680
flying.

d985f247-20cc-4e88-a58f-91b410884fd6-0
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.640
With the dark sky and no stars.

6560e4c6-d9c5-44ff-bd07-203d1b33bdd3-0
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.255
In the water is the paper boat,
and coming up out of the water

6560e4c6-d9c5-44ff-bd07-203d1b33bdd3-1
00:43:03.255 --> 00:43:04.660
it looks like Donuts.

50083248-8125-4738-9349-7f9286f71dab-0
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.871
So round objects with a hole in
the middle, partly in the water,

50083248-8125-4738-9349-7f9286f71dab-1
00:43:10.871 --> 00:43:15.824
but mostly coming up out of the
water and floating through one

50083248-8125-4738-9349-7f9286f71dab-2
00:43:15.824 --> 00:43:18.970
of those donut holes is the
paper boat.

c35d6c4b-1448-45a3-b700-4af62387c6dd-0
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.600
Coming up out of all of those
doughnut hole looking objects.

57ac4225-c61e-4cb0-9961-51dbc9f0b507-0
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.110
Is.

157265f0-798a-4f55-812b-ef998e6e16b4-0
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.550
Kind of a snake.

6e9dcd2b-e27d-4720-b929-19043d45591c-0
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.950
The back of the snake looks just
like the top of those.

cc9e0618-ef19-4493-b215-ce7228bf85f6-0
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:41.520
Doughnuts, so those are probably
all snakes arched up out of the

cc9e0618-ef19-4493-b215-ce7228bf85f6-1
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:41.950
water.

15a46334-da6a-478c-b6f2-239e8e3d9f77-0
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.490
OK.

309b6143-7fbb-484e-be2e-9ddd7cde71ec-0
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:59.293
Now we've zoomed in underneath
those doughnut looking objects

309b6143-7fbb-484e-be2e-9ddd7cde71ec-1
00:43:59.293 --> 00:44:04.076
that are probably snake backs
coming up out of the water, and

309b6143-7fbb-484e-be2e-9ddd7cde71ec-2
00:44:04.076 --> 00:44:07.780
the paper boat is floating
through those those.

5c9e3baa-313e-4fd5-9fe8-7410914c4e78-0
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.340
Donut holes.

e8d32037-5ea7-4498-87a4-340659f079c7-0
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:16.992
Those arches and you can see the
head of some of the snakes with

e8d32037-5ea7-4498-87a4-340659f079c7-1
00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:19.460
the bright glowing eyes.

fe5f9cec-15e5-450d-9f78-8c936aaecefb-0
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:24.620
And the boat is headed towards 2
animals, one animal.

cc738686-45f5-4e43-b138-251aacc397bc-0
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.128
Is black and white with arms and
glowing eyes, and has a long

cc738686-45f5-4e43-b138-251aacc397bc-1
00:44:30.128 --> 00:44:33.070
horn growing out of the top of
its head.

10fcf5c2-232f-4ae4-baf2-17aeebf24537-0
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:45.000
The paper boat's now back out in
the open water with the small

10fcf5c2-232f-4ae4-baf2-17aeebf24537-1
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.440

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.152
Openings like water hose
openings, so coming out of

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:24.236
Streams of water that look like
waterfalls coming down onto the

68351526-0433-4987-990f-304838a7c4ae-1
00:45:24.236 --> 00:45:28.170
paper boat, and it's filling the
paper boat with with water.

611b518a-3426-4a8a-b909-8d8edc6f08b8-0
00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:34.250
There's also another animal next
to it coming up out of the water

611b518a-3426-4a8a-b909-8d8edc6f08b8-1
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:38.178
that looks kind of like an
elephant, and the elephant's

611b518a-3426-4a8a-b909-8d8edc6f08b8-2

It's.

96d20cc6-13ed-4eda-95eb-e75fa8ae2274-0
00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.854
They're kind of next to a a bit
of land that looks like sand

96d20cc6-13ed-4eda-95eb-e75fa8ae2274-1
00:45:54.854 --> 00:46:00.213

96d20cc6-13ed-4eda-95eb-e75fa8ae2274-2
00:46:00.213 --> 00:46:05.760
that have floated in from the
water. And standing on that.

96d20cc6-13ed-4eda-95eb-e75fa8ae2274-3
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:11.495
That land or that sand is kind
of a fish, a very tall skinny

96d20cc6-13ed-4eda-95eb-e75fa8ae2274-4
00:46:11.495 --> 00:46:15.820
fish that's dark with white,
white spots and.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:20.690
The fish has legs. Legs that
look like a person.

3402cd0c-a0d5-40c2-9962-f1ddfd815fdc-0
00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:24.730
But the feet look like lizard
feet.

9b47d1c1-b1c9-4c83-8bc1-a7730db22b6d-0
00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:32.511
Oh yeah, lizard feet and the
fish is wearing striped swimming

9b47d1c1-b1c9-4c83-8bc1-a7730db22b6d-1
00:46:32.511 --> 00:46:35.070

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.460
Now you can see under the water
and the paper boat has sunk.

acca4819-3c72-42d9-91af-c6f76e5f8c4b-0
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:55.404
And it's sinking down into the
water with air bubbles floating

acca4819-3c72-42d9-91af-c6f76e5f8c4b-1
00:46:55.404 --> 00:47:00.579
up from it. Towards the top of
the water. Underneath are a lot

acca4819-3c72-42d9-91af-c6f76e5f8c4b-2
00:47:00.579 --> 00:47:05.672
of jellyfish, so he's fallen
into the water and is surrounded

acca4819-3c72-42d9-91af-c6f76e5f8c4b-3
00:47:05.672 --> 00:47:06.739
by jellyfish.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:15.988
The paper boat continues to fall
down into the water, sink down

6ba6351b-faf1-45d3-bed3-669ef0e4d776-1
00:47:15.988 --> 00:47:20.526
into the water. It's very dark
in the water and it's surrounded

6ba6351b-faf1-45d3-bed3-669ef0e4d776-2
00:47:20.526 --> 00:47:24.993
now by a large school of fish.
The fish have the glowing white

6ba6351b-faf1-45d3-bed3-669ef0e4d776-3
00:47:24.993 --> 00:47:25.489
lights.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:39.517
The paper boat has landed on the
bottom of the ocean on the ocean

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.310
And some animals are crawling.

9b7f97b8-0cd3-4949-a17d-e646eca818bb-0
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.810
Some animals with many legs,
each of them have many legs.

138c9195-7e1f-4886-b611-c2bbfb9bf182-0
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:56.227
And they are crawling into the
paper boat. Shining down onto

138c9195-7e1f-4886-b611-c2bbfb9bf182-1
00:47:56.227 --> 00:48:00.811

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.629
right down onto the boat.

dc024461-2b6c-438f-89b9-e3d65ca33b80-0
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.136
Next to the boat you can see
what looks like a submarine has

dc024461-2b6c-438f-89b9-e3d65ca33b80-1
00:48:08.136 --> 00:48:08.490

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:41.124
The submarine is partly in the
water and out of the water, so

533fbf00-187c-449c-8b5b-a48d06c00bfd-1
00:48:41.124 --> 00:48:43.620
the submarine has managed to.

00:48:54.241 --> 00:48:57.834
submarine. The submarine has
come to the surface of the

09d391c5-7aa3-4e09-9a89-458f0127567f-0
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:33.340
Taking containers off the top of
the boat.

f7bde6da-da09-4150-bd71-98ec30eae679-0
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.750
Let's see, there's a.

1bb67395-b8bc-43a4-ab49-8aa7587c2c30-0
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:43.585
Kind of a fishing boat, and the
White Paper boat has come up

1bb67395-b8bc-43a4-ab49-8aa7587c2c30-1
00:59:43.585 --> 00:59:44.710
alongside of it.

747f6984-ad62-4124-ae54-94c046b95c80-0
00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:49.308
Looks like he's asking a
question. There's a man on the

747f6984-ad62-4124-ae54-94c046b95c80-1
00:59:49.308 --> 00:59:53.558
fishing boat in a striped shirt
and dark pants leaning over the

747f6984-ad62-4124-ae54-94c046b95c80-2
00:59:53.558 --> 00:59:54.090
railing.

7c240d66-8ca3-425d-93d7-eab520a9b97d-0
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.040
Talking to the White Paper boat.

819d8c08-9608-434c-85e1-e35f12dc7850-0
00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.940
Off the front of this fishing
boat is a crane with a.

3e404283-2526-4e19-b0d9-48e2f0eff760-0
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.814
Net hanging off of it, that's
been gathered up. The net was

3e404283-2526-4e19-b0d9-48e2f0eff760-1
01:00:10.814 --> 01:00:14.750
down in the water and it
gathered up and it caught a lot

3e404283-2526-4e19-b0d9-48e2f0eff760-2
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.963
of animals and it looks like
it's caught the animal with the

3e404283-2526-4e19-b0d9-48e2f0eff760-3
01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:22.210
long horn striped horn coming
out of its head.

ae040dfa-f24e-4551-9f53-5079e42bca2a-0
01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:35.734
The White Paper boats still down
on the water and the fishing,

ae040dfa-f24e-4551-9f53-5079e42bca2a-1
01:00:35.734 --> 01:00:38.440
some fishing, a fishing boat's
next to him.

be7e4962-5d17-448d-ad6d-844ea55aa843-0
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:41.270
There are.

4be5f860-c358-4cc6-a0ef-75606f2471b9-0
01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.410
Houses alongside the water.

a6addaa4-22e8-41bd-a8ab-59a4ff787c2d-0
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.970
With boats docked in with a boat
docked in front of them.

619217d5-cd77-4c24-8801-b6958fab2ddf-0
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:54.960
There are a lot of buildings
the.

0aae2c15-e5fc-48bd-8be0-a9cf9b2c9212-0
01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.598
The buildings are tall, short,
medium. Some of them have Dome

0aae2c15-e5fc-48bd-8be0-a9cf9b2c9212-1
01:01:01.598 --> 01:01:07.068

statue in the very back that
looks like a an elk standing

0aae2c15-e5fc-48bd-8be0-a9cf9b2c9212-3

Antlers off the top of his head.

8f810c02-11bb-4da1-9457-eaaaee1818cb-0
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:19.902
All the buildings have windows
in them. Some of the windows you

8f810c02-11bb-4da1-9457-eaaaee1818cb-1
01:01:19.902 --> 01:01:23.000
can see the lights are on and
some of them are off.

f3010e9e-58ac-45cb-80ad-fdd1f05dabb9-0
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:29.781

kind of arched buildings over

f3010e9e-58ac-45cb-80ad-fdd1f05dabb9-1

A series of two 3,4 of those.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:40.130
And in those archways.

059c7c8c-405a-4be5-8ec7-18133f2fae3c-0
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:45.604
There are windows and some of
the windows have lights on and

059c7c8c-405a-4be5-8ec7-18133f2fae3c-1
01:01:45.604 --> 01:01:48.760

You can see a lot of birds and
pigeons flying around and

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.950
The White Paper boat has floated
in under some of those arches.

85bc4500-ceb2-46a0-883a-1deef43916a7-0
01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.130
And is at the base of a set of
stairs.

9497e9df-09eb-448f-9b40-6b3dabd17354-0
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.380

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:22.920
Some animals and kind of people
looking objects. One of them is.

b4456bfc-7655-4673-a5d3-1b3cfaace5b0-0
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.840
Someone who looks like a scuba
diver.

ce7a13d4-96e8-4129-bd4f-d76e908aa340-0
01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:32.540
One of them looks like a court
jester with a costume on, with

ce7a13d4-96e8-4129-bd4f-d76e908aa340-1
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.660
bells hanging off of them
hanging off of the costume.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.830
There's.

eaf088b4-fe93-4761-863b-59ee319f7495-0
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.240
A horse.

0048ffe0-a061-4a66-b423-3949eed289b6-0
01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:50.050
Dark horse with white spots on
it and it's being ridden by the.

629a8359-3452-4292-88f2-daa4526357ea-0
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.390
By the.

ee2ddbe4-89f9-4877-9245-66eca9af24f0-0
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:58.795
Dark costume that we saw earlier
with The White Stripes on it and

ee2ddbe4-89f9-4877-9245-66eca9af24f0-1
01:02:58.795 --> 01:03:00.820
the white horns coming out of
the top.

545dfc34-5583-4e70-9fc6-cbb27e20ef36-0
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.860
Can also see the boat that.

098871a6-90b6-4465-b6f3-0ecc986f1f53-0
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:11.105
A boat that had a kite used as a
sail that's also at the bottom

098871a6-90b6-4465-b6f3-0ecc986f1f53-1
01:03:11.105 --> 01:03:12.120
of the steps.

b03d588e-4234-4cde-ac9f-dded8064b6bb-0
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:15.270
And.

b4f2a7c8-e9f9-4475-8f6f-146d7992e121-0
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.510
Now the paper White Paper boat
is floating on.

9b77d548-22e6-4901-9b03-dcd1683244b3-0
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.020
Through the water under all of
those archways.

fdf9e16f-d546-473f-ac4d-a920694424be-0
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:37.666
I think the paper boat has now
come out from under the

fdf9e16f-d546-473f-ac4d-a920694424be-1
01:03:37.666 --> 01:03:42.510
archways. It's nighttime and the
sky is dark with a lot of stars.

9951bee9-bb1d-405b-b36c-2137b7e656c9-0
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.220
And from under the archway you
can see four fish.

1b38ef27-c66d-4c70-97e8-de37c44c8684-0
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:52.297
Have come up out of the water.
They're the ones with the

1b38ef27-c66d-4c70-97e8-de37c44c8684-1
01:03:52.297 --> 01:03:56.671
glowing white eyes and they're
staring after the white boat.

1b38ef27-c66d-4c70-97e8-de37c44c8684-2
01:03:56.671 --> 01:04:00.830
The White Paper boat is also
being followed by a another.

f5a893cd-d4e0-4bba-8fec-3c5fb8d0148f-0
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.860
Umm.

7525ee2e-7354-4b4b-aaec-54f03cab0c30-0
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:08.878
Like wooden boat, I don't see
any people on it. And also being

7525ee2e-7354-4b4b-aaec-54f03cab0c30-1
01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:13.846
followed by an object that looks
kind of like a submarine or a

7525ee2e-7354-4b4b-aaec-54f03cab0c30-2
01:04:13.846 --> 01:04:17.710
blimp that's partly out of the
water with white.

3ada0a48-4591-40bc-82ae-94a77bc3b1a5-0
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:24.406
Light and dark shapes on it
alongside the on either side of

3ada0a48-4591-40bc-82ae-94a77bc3b1a5-1
01:04:24.406 --> 01:04:29.980
the water are tall walls, brick
walls that are built up.

7b196389-394c-44e9-8cbb-995691ed622b-0
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.980
And at the top of our houses.

01db5172-ac0e-4682-acf0-4e11d7965bf3-0
01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.510
And the wall is lined by street
lights.

19df2907-9fb3-4c80-98a9-7eeabaf654b6-0
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.285
The White Paper boat is still in
the water and it's approaching a

19df2907-9fb3-4c80-98a9-7eeabaf654b6-1
01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:53.130
brick wall, and up on top of the
brick wall is.

f693e1de-c5b1-4a36-b890-374788d945ab-0
01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.590
A White House.

4ff4fcf5-7398-45ae-a563-13e26d808af9-0
01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:02.123
With a street light in front of
it and it's surrounded by a lot

4ff4fcf5-7398-45ae-a563-13e26d808af9-1
01:05:02.123 --> 01:05:02.340
of.

ba0e9df4-151d-4011-9c93-bd565f6f9200-0
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.850
Bushes, trees.

d3e5a3fb-b7ef-4f5f-b552-9090fececb3e-0
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:07.400
The paper.

03945b75-4212-4d3d-8de7-3b3f85f22ec8-0
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:09.520
Boat.

f0f467fe-c623-4f78-9e8a-da3b1a2f56a8-0
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.390
Is floating alongside the brick
wall.

07f4bbef-b0ac-4e6f-a241-52b3083d018d-0
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:17.490
And.

ada18a08-d559-46cd-884c-be6d91649ff6-0
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:23.326
An object is very faint. You can
see an object on the boat in the

ada18a08-d559-46cd-884c-be6d91649ff6-1
01:05:23.326 --> 01:05:28.190
sail, and it's very faint and
then it gets darker and darker.

913addd0-eba5-4ff1-bfc0-8542848a563f-0
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:31.700
And it stands up out of the
boat.

a419e98c-25e0-4464-8ee0-71df56d85f56-0
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.160
And is walking up the steps and
it looks like a.

4ad3591d-9dda-48fa-b462-362e6a8b074c-0
01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:41.260
Dark person with drawings.

09bdc04d-f5f0-4a48-8a2f-3c5c3ff0bab1-0
01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:45.020
On it, and he's walking up the
steps.

f63b97b1-1761-4978-b638-dce36d805e7c-0
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.110
Towards another.

d6f986c8-6d0f-4999-b159-803f0f434365-0
01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:51.473
Set of legs. So now you can see
two legs that are dark and two

d6f986c8-6d0f-4999-b159-803f0f434365-1
01:05:51.473 --> 01:05:54.890
legs that are light at the top
of the brick wall. #END_wanderer

01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:58.810
My God.

1999a0cd-5d3f-4472-99f1-83330d458b87-0
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.895
OK, I have. I have figured out
that there's you're showing me

1999a0cd-5d3f-4472-99f1-83330d458b87-1
01:06:06.895 --> 01:06:08.270
things that are pretty.

1fa060b5-ba97-4103-afa1-6fca2194ac28-0
01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:12.410
Undescribable.

a621bd2f-6660-441d-8096-38d8cd007c48-0
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.490
So it's to try to get me to.

48348087-de88-44ef-a79c-1d4fae2fb17f-0
01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:22.118
Give words to it. It's it's
like, what am I looking at? I

48348087-de88-44ef-a79c-1d4fae2fb17f-1
01:06:22.118 --> 01:06:26.193
know some of them are a little
abstract. Oh my gosh, I know

48348087-de88-44ef-a79c-1d4fae2fb17f-2
01:06:26.193 --> 01:06:30.471
that one was a little long. That
was the first time I've ever,

48348087-de88-44ef-a79c-1d4fae2fb17f-3
01:06:30.471 --> 01:06:32.780
like, went through that one
ever.

67672666-048f-42cd-9c68-64574a36be3c-0
01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:38.350
Wow. It's like, how do I, how do
I describe it? But that's

67672666-048f-42cd-9c68-64574a36be3c-1
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.250
exactly what you're trying to
do, right? Is?

23c4600c-29bd-4549-94f9-61f78037600c-0
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.960
How would you describe it and.

b9d41b35-6489-413d-b1c4-df806e3b4484-0
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:48.630
To me it's undescribable, but to
someone with aphasia it might.

2b5cea2b-c99b-4884-a5ac-6f44d850da5b-0
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.410
I don't know.

ef125fdd-97ed-4be3-9653-1a67b8e04afc-0
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.839
Yeah, so if you want to take
like a 2-3 minute break, because

ef125fdd-97ed-4be3-9653-1a67b8e04afc-1
01:06:56.839 --> 01:07:01.315
I know that one was really long
and then we just have a few more

ef125fdd-97ed-4be3-9653-1a67b8e04afc-2
01:07:01.315 --> 01:07:01.660
left.

925b27b9-471a-48dc-976b-a373e62e491f-0
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.740
And I'll pull up the next one
while you.

3cd5c7ab-ca42-4d9a-b5ee-c9c57295f4bc-0
01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.367
Now I know how my husband feels
when he's trying to describe

3cd5c7ab-ca42-4d9a-b5ee-c9c57295f4bc-1
01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:19.050
something, because it really
tires out your brain.

c7457b60-5634-485e-b80d-3e485da75641-0
01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:26.921
Yeah, it's a lot of work. It is
a lot of work. I got done last

c7457b60-5634-485e-b80d-3e485da75641-1
01:07:26.921 --> 01:07:29.260
time and I was like I am wiped
out.

b02bb986-f2b2-49dd-893c-03768eb08109-0
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.799
And you know, and he's just
trying to describe common

b02bb986-f2b2-49dd-893c-03768eb08109-1
01:07:41.799 --> 01:07:42.510
objects.

04691d4f-8c35-442d-972c-c707b7d7f61d-0
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.270
Yeah, I know it's really hard.

c42867f9-cefa-4320-aa67-09815c3e21c7-0
01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.160
Yep.

87e29823-a118-41fc-be20-a644e4f2c519-0
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.102
And then just like let me let me
know when you're ready and then

87e29823-a118-41fc-be20-a644e4f2c519-1
01:07:55.102 --> 01:07:55.610
I'll just.

5d17a470-41d0-4d25-adee-9d8c913777a3-0
01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.240
Just want to make sure I shared
the right thing, yeah.

2f12e6c5-6543-42ad-b455-2a06c59bc8fd-0
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:20.921
And then there's so much in the
pictures you can't describe

2f12e6c5-6543-42ad-b455-2a06c59bc8fd-1
01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:21.540
everything.

084c13dd-e9f7-45f9-b1f3-67556d2fd9a4-0
01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:24.600
No, it's it's a lot, yeah.

900c595d-ef19-4a04-ac93-249225d84e96-0
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.290
OK, so I'll share my screen.

ff275bb0-b285-4335-9493-5afff0386f81-0
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.820
And then?

c3b1e724-e199-435b-a20c-e01f36be6b0f-0
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:41.473
So yeah, just take like 3 to 4
minutes to describe this one.

c3b1e724-e199-435b-a20c-e01f36be6b0f-1
01:08:41.473 --> 01:08:42.890
It's just a complex scene.

6cfadbd3-9467-415c-ab08-9a74c6461441-0
01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.040
#START_waldo_1 Yeah, looks like
Where's Waldo? Yep.

382b605e-4c5c-43cf-b77e-054377bdc39a-0
01:08:55.830 --> 01:09:00.620
OK, we can see a a scene of a
village. It's very colorful.

f3b7fcd3-eb4c-400d-8bf8-c34dd8339af7-0
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.140
In the middle of the village is
a triangle.

a89e929d-959b-4e35-b8e6-bd057c255d30-0
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.862
Kind of like the village square,
but it's a village triangle and

a89e929d-959b-4e35-b8e6-bd057c255d30-1
01:09:10.862 --> 01:09:13.580
there's a fountain in the middle
of the triangle.

7a5d3ab6-cd96-482d-b962-3db388242112-0
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.067
With water coming up out of the
fountain and on top of the

7a5d3ab6-cd96-482d-b962-3db388242112-1
01:09:18.067 --> 01:09:18.400
water.

6e1afaf7-505f-4d8a-9721-b5cdcbbb1297-0
01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.730
Is a person in a red swimming
suit.

75e26fea-a2ac-4c62-b5c0-d920bc0085f5-0
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:23.410
With.

b611ae45-c830-430c-8bc9-e5319185496d-0
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.280
Green with green flippers.

02a9f829-96b8-4ea5-9e08-50d3fa35310f-0
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.080
And looks like he has a snorkel
on.

6f2f9d3f-7517-4d98-a32e-5603875ffaca-0
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.705
There are a lot of people
standing around the fountain

6f2f9d3f-7517-4d98-a32e-5603875ffaca-1
01:09:37.705 --> 01:09:38.820
just walking around.

bd3b40d6-1560-4e2a-a7b3-748682101b96-0
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.420
Uh, let's see.

8fdfbc22-eb7e-4a77-9bb8-59c0ba06ccd5-0
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.010
Then on either side of the
triangle are roads.

b32bde87-aa39-4c92-8a0c-4b1c598153f9-0
01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:55.882
And in the road are cars,
there's a green car that looks

b32bde87-aa39-4c92-8a0c-4b1c598153f9-1
01:09:55.882 --> 01:10:01.090
like a VW bug, and there's a
blue car with a person with a

b32bde87-aa39-4c92-8a0c-4b1c598153f9-2
01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:05.240
yellow shirt hanging off the
passenger window.

988ca9fa-ee42-4fa1-ab8d-d0a3d75f50fc-0
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.665
There's a yellow truck that
looks like it's just been

988ca9fa-ee42-4fa1-ab8d-d0a3d75f50fc-1
01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:13.970
rear-ended by a red car.

273c3c22-74ea-47c9-a8ca-122d130da71a-0
01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:20.540
And I think both drivers have
gotten out and are.

0f60b0ab-9fe1-4b7d-872f-932e743ad624-0
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.830
Are arguing.

be908b12-86be-4f81-a9f5-a7d29c365742-0
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:31.077
Some of the buildings that are
around the triangle are a two

be908b12-86be-4f81-a9f5-a7d29c365742-1
01:10:31.077 --> 01:10:32.660
story pink building.

b74fd3b5-dc28-4c64-b27d-69a584160fb8-0
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.580
And has a lot of blue windows.

02367366-151e-46c9-b62f-781cabf2df11-0
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.310
On the front and the side, and
each window has a flower box

02367366-151e-46c9-b62f-781cabf2df11-1
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:45.870
with green plants growing
growing in front of it.

238a97c2-9893-4a15-958b-cc06803245cd-0
01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:51.150
The front door of the building
has a red and white canopy.

2d582b8e-8c2d-47d1-a81f-3debb9daaac9-0
01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:56.700
On the front and a red carpet.

54295c9c-799d-4d52-bd39-8b29e438c547-0
01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:00.600
Looks like maybe a hotel,
because there's a person

54295c9c-799d-4d52-bd39-8b29e438c547-1
01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.565
standing at the front door kind
of guiding people to the front

54295c9c-799d-4d52-bd39-8b29e438c547-2
01:11:04.565 --> 01:11:04.880
door.

7a38af51-d64a-4100-8d40-1e65d69d20ff-0
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:10.530
Roof of the two-story pink
building is dark.

307a9ee8-cedb-4c84-9bcd-c13729e20ff1-0
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:13.270
Pink. Kind of red.

ef32fb5d-789d-4626-b583-e5a9720df0cc-0
01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.050
With dormer windows coming out
of the front and the side and

ef32fb5d-789d-4626-b583-e5a9720df0cc-1
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:20.950
there are people who have come
out onto the.

97dbaa31-28b3-4c11-9d30-8366a6aaba79-0
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.990
Unto the roof.

8ad06c42-f169-45a8-9b12-2ea4a585f889-0
01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:31.977
The building next door is
another two-story building

8ad06c42-f169-45a8-9b12-2ea4a585f889-1
01:11:31.977 --> 01:11:35.570
that's blue with speckled blue
paint on it.

c9d39753-3f5d-4030-be18-4d8400392e9e-0
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:42.656
And it has a flat roof that is a
a roof deck, and on top of the

c9d39753-3f5d-4030-be18-4d8400392e9e-1
01:11:42.656 --> 01:11:44.540
roof deck there's a.

f580e651-e08e-490d-88dd-e11b59bf1005-0
01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.411
A lady sitting feeding the
birds, and then there are two

f580e651-e08e-490d-88dd-e11b59bf1005-1
01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:55.328
men in blue coveralls with
buckets on their heads, and they

f580e651-e08e-490d-88dd-e11b59bf1005-2
01:11:55.328 --> 01:11:59.835
each have a mop and they are
fighting like their sword

f580e651-e08e-490d-88dd-e11b59bf1005-3
01:11:59.835 --> 01:12:02.950
fighting, but they're using the
mops.

f5c6bd04-ee2a-49bd-958e-52a28be86abb-0
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.920
Across the street from the front
of the triangle.

7024600e-af06-4b29-ab19-706cbf880bfb-0
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:17.160
There's an open area where
people are gathered. There are.

87f664d7-9131-4117-967e-a8404269716a-0
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:25.890
A variety of stands set up and
each stand has striped colored.

9cb5761f-af78-4a5b-870a-359f85c7d595-0
01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.060
Canvas roofs.

28cc6daa-a785-46d7-9069-47c82f7eb137-0
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:34.358
Or coverings on them. So there's
a blue and white striped, red

28cc6daa-a785-46d7-9069-47c82f7eb137-1
01:12:34.358 --> 01:12:39.423
and white striped and green and
white striped. And they're

28cc6daa-a785-46d7-9069-47c82f7eb137-2
01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:45.090
stands that are probably selling
fruit, vegetables, maybe plants.

cc2f1226-0b13-4d56-a5ea-96d40e57847b-0
01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.734
And there's a lot of people
mingling around the stands. Some

cc2f1226-0b13-4d56-a5ea-96d40e57847b-1
01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:56.661
people have their dogs with them
on a leash. Another older

cc2f1226-0b13-4d56-a5ea-96d40e57847b-2
01:12:56.661 --> 01:13:02.090
couples walking. He's got a blue
suit with lighter colored pants

cc2f1226-0b13-4d56-a5ea-96d40e57847b-3
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:06.934
with a an older woman walking
with him, and they both are

cc2f1226-0b13-4d56-a5ea-96d40e57847b-4
01:13:06.934 --> 01:13:08.019
using a cane.

2cb48e34-b845-46d4-b6d0-3bd76ff65b64-0
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.610
There's someone playing a
violin.

ec912c05-e778-4d9b-8f2e-5194a5fe0bf1-0
01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:11.970
Umm.

d434c3a9-04ed-4eaa-aa84-ba2b2a73dbdb-0
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.490
Trying to make a little money.

8d929a7c-d6d7-4b61-a24f-377ee15dd79d-0
01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.750
And there.

996e9284-1212-4132-8e28-6465c22e8979-0
01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.480
Are.

04faf29c-aa8b-4309-ba7b-4b5de0c19752-0
01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:22.690
Let's see.

408b18ee-e521-4d6b-b5eb-d79723a714b6-0
01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:29.623
In this, in the street behind
them, there's a boy riding a

408b18ee-e521-4d6b-b5eb-d79723a714b6-1
01:13:29.623 --> 01:13:30.470
bicycle.

51f8fd3c-99d6-4063-8fef-1de9df945bde-0
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:36.955
And there's a manhole cover in
the street, and a person has

51f8fd3c-99d6-4063-8fef-1de9df945bde-1
01:13:36.955 --> 01:13:41.863
come up out of the manhole
holding the cover above his

51f8fd3c-99d6-4063-8fef-1de9df945bde-2
01:13:41.863 --> 01:13:42.310
head.

35e6d28a-ecda-4ed7-ad10-ccc45baa41b5-0
01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.900
There's someone studying.

d6a949f7-ffa4-4ad4-9774-d73536b52aa0-0

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.960
white striped swim trunks.

ddb18ccb-3a2d-41bc-ac62-63ec9ecea346-0
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:58.110
Some of them are standing on the
ocean floor.

09af0918-9c25-48c7-b9b4-34caeed0d71a-0
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:05.335
And others are swimming through
the water. There are some of the

09af0918-9c25-48c7-b9b4-34caeed0d71a-1
01:29:05.335 --> 01:29:08.934
mermaids who are swimming
through the water along with the

09af0918-9c25-48c7-b9b4-34caeed0d71a-2
01:29:08.934 --> 01:29:09.240
fish.

1821f62d-83a2-4a8b-9acf-d1173fcfd2bb-0
01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:14.030
And jellyfish.

836fcc93-ca8c-40a3-9f72-27a0ff42fed5-0
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.668
Lot of spearfishing. There's a
man who's spearfishing with a

836fcc93-ca8c-40a3-9f72-27a0ff42fed5-1
01:29:20.668 --> 01:29:24.770
long spear and he's accidentally
poked another swimmer.

c53d5491-d646-4aec-adc8-5b8daf3457ac-0
01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.160
There is a swimmer with red and
white striped trunks.

ad14859f-4a97-4499-b690-a79d9ef030b7-0
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.260
And.

a05c074e-34c9-41da-a5df-56d218d5c692-0
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.030
He has.

3d887c1a-c9b1-409c-b5f4-6f2d03db4cfc-0
01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.430
What looks like

0a7d10e8-be8a-4260-8737-da93378e7421-0
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:43.463
The fin of a shark, and he's got
that above the water, so it

0a7d10e8-be8a-4260-8737-da93378e7421-1
01:29:43.463 --> 01:29:46.897
looks like there's a shark in
the water and it's scaring the

0a7d10e8-be8a-4260-8737-da93378e7421-2
01:29:46.897 --> 01:29:48.980
people that are swimming around
him.

80ae1c29-8d0a-4627-9509-bf3a765361db-0
01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:55.580
Umm.

d803c5a8-cdda-4b09-aab0-16d1cb81fbcb-0
01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:58.430
Let's see.

06643c0c-7145-455e-a197-f5973fc3a142-0
01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:05.175
There are some real sharks
swimming around, and there's a

06643c0c-7145-455e-a197-f5973fc3a142-1
01:30:05.175 --> 01:30:09.600
green snake who's both in and
out of the water.

72013a16-fd10-4ae9-ad95-70b0ebdb3bca-0
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:15.136
And there are other fish, blue
fish who are blue and green fish

72013a16-fd10-4ae9-ad95-70b0ebdb3bca-1
01:30:15.136 --> 01:30:18.999
who are swimming in the shape of
arrows, 3 arrows right in a row.

72013a16-fd10-4ae9-ad95-70b0ebdb3bca-2
01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:20.170
#END_deep_sea_divers

184d3a47-b447-4c15-97bf-572a396c449b-0
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:27.098
OK, perfect. And now let's see
what now you could just go on

184d3a47-b447-4c15-97bf-572a396c449b-1
01:30:27.098 --> 01:30:28.550
and on. So, yeah.

d741d2c1-9a47-4ac5-9a75-726ba342a272-0
01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:33.210
You're good. OK. So next we have
our last short story.

fab65e67-51f6-4fa7-bae0-70820e483403-0
01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.040
Let me.

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:37.820
Pull it up.

9481dbff-ab65-46fe-98d0-d51539f43c3e-0
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:45.720
OK, so it is.

4dd59114-0d67-42ae-b311-71c0ba2a53ba-0
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.895
Four slides long and you have
approximately 10 to 15 minutes

4dd59114-0d67-42ae-b311-71c0ba2a53ba-1
01:30:50.895 --> 01:30:55.124
to go through them. Like before.
Just tell me when you want to

4dd59114-0d67-42ae-b311-71c0ba2a53ba-2
01:30:55.124 --> 01:30:56.400
move on and I will.

e819bc18-c14f-4e77-8033-2e4c469bb2a1-0
01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:07.220
#START_arrival_5 OK, the
pictures we can see are.

f010c00d-69c2-4e73-9902-8c83cfb701b0-0
01:31:08.290 --> 01:31:13.120
Are there's no colors, it's just
light and dark shades.

2c6cbeee-9b9c-4128-b4f6-612822a18232-0
01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:15.630
There's a.

bc648b74-ec6d-4c26-bc68-653f3cc5ecf3-0
01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:25.244
Let's see, there's a body of
water with a small row boat in

bc648b74-ec6d-4c26-bc68-653f3cc5ecf3-1
01:31:25.244 --> 01:31:29.533
the water with three or four
people in it, and the boats

bc648b74-ec6d-4c26-bc68-653f3cc5ecf3-2
01:31:29.533 --> 01:31:34.273
rowing up to a wooden ramp that
comes up out of the water. And

bc648b74-ec6d-4c26-bc68-653f3cc5ecf3-3
01:31:34.273 --> 01:31:37.960
on the ramp are a lot of row
boats being stored.

1ac76391-e746-427b-b6a4-fb6cbb8a2b8a-0
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:45.671
The ramp is alongside a lot of
different buildings, like three

1ac76391-e746-427b-b6a4-fb6cbb8a2b8a-1
01:31:45.671 --> 01:31:48.100
and four story buildings.

2d19942a-4eef-4212-8ef1-1175bb464795-0
01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:51.200
With.

62b7ffc3-7096-4bb8-9bb8-ac748c6befcf-0
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:56.730
Lots of windows in each of the
buildings.

4f955bb1-6888-479a-8ab1-7d2d96d64caa-0
01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:00.320
Up in the sky are dark birds.

4e31fb59-58eb-4249-a97c-d7e4029c18cf-0
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:02.380
Filling the sky.

c272d6f1-9fc7-4362-9759-6604749bb395-0
01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:08.690
Then we have a series of
individual pictures.

11f6e93c-a936-4983-b8ae-4eefd764df4e-0
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:16.320
So we see one where a person is
wrapping a rope around a cat.

211fa8bd-4b91-4a5b-a51c-c9849e99124c-0
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.210
Like statue.

4b226f27-a313-4ca0-ab9a-3ffc86d8fde6-0
01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:20.910
There are.

e8160f93-e17f-49c1-a0b4-99703e82286f-0
01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.893
Two people, two men chatting.
One has a dark suit and dark

e8160f93-e17f-49c1-a0b4-99703e82286f-1
01:32:25.893 --> 01:32:29.812
hat, and he's talking to another
man with a white shirt and

e8160f93-e17f-49c1-a0b4-99703e82286f-2
01:32:29.812 --> 01:32:33.732
suspenders. That man has is
wearing glasses and is carrying

e8160f93-e17f-49c1-a0b4-99703e82286f-3
01:32:33.732 --> 01:32:34.319
a basket.

3780f3ed-07e2-491f-831f-bc913bcb43da-0
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.590
And he's pointing off to the
distance.

0da4e8f5-b62a-4550-a5d0-48e7ad8b0f1d-0
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.120
Off to the side while he's
talking to the man.

de7c5408-4cc1-4a89-8ed9-22b4c45f16c4-0
01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:45.601
There's a young boy who's
walking with a basket. The boy

de7c5408-4cc1-4a89-8ed9-22b4c45f16c4-1
01:32:45.601 --> 01:32:47.210
has a white shirt and shorts.

9b08847d-5d59-4731-a9fc-3810d0887c13-0
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:52.371
Darker shorts and dark shoes.
He's being followed by two

9b08847d-5d59-4731-a9fc-3810d0887c13-1
01:32:52.371 --> 01:32:57.426
strange looking animals. One is
black and one is white and they

9b08847d-5d59-4731-a9fc-3810d0887c13-2
01:32:57.426 --> 01:32:58.689
both have tails.

3f15b3a9-e56f-48ce-9361-6138f81660a2-0
01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:05.844
The little boy with the basket.
The basket is full of fruit and

3f15b3a9-e56f-48ce-9361-6138f81660a2-1
01:33:05.844 --> 01:33:10.789
vegetables and he's handing it
to a woman. Woman with dark hair

3f15b3a9-e56f-48ce-9361-6138f81660a2-2
01:33:10.789 --> 01:33:12.179
and a white dress.

987ca7eb-02b5-4a9a-b7db-9595421d7bcb-0
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:17.338
Now the woman with the white
dress and dark hair is hugging

987ca7eb-02b5-4a9a-b7db-9595421d7bcb-1
01:33:17.338 --> 01:33:17.750
the man.

4ca600b5-0f3b-44ba-8519-97d1f53309cd-0
01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.713
With the white shirt and
suspenders and glasses. And that

4ca600b5-0f3b-44ba-8519-97d1f53309cd-1
01:33:22.713 --> 01:33:24.160
man also has a basket.

3af69026-ca6c-47ec-97a9-109668509bc5-0
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:30.499
The woman is talking to both men
now, and he's she's shaking the

3af69026-ca6c-47ec-97a9-109668509bc5-1
01:33:30.499 --> 01:33:31.050
hand of.

6d79f467-6363-423a-a40e-03ed9b12e45b-0
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:36.412
The man with the dark suit. The
man with the dark suit has taken

6d79f467-6363-423a-a40e-03ed9b12e45b-1
01:33:36.412 --> 01:33:39.020
off his hat to shake hands with
the woman.

206439c9-a97d-4434-ab2e-fec2c58653bf-0
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:42.640
And the woman is now inviting
him inside the house.

28dbeefc-6464-4a5b-8e68-ccfdde36cf50-0
01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:45.040
So now you can see.

7c9be084-e54b-494c-8f0d-9b38a655e392-0
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:54.122
Oh, the woman standing holding a
glass with some liquid in the

7c9be084-e54b-494c-8f0d-9b38a655e392-1
01:33:54.122 --> 01:33:57.140
glass, and there are three other
hands.

f6922961-eca1-4020-b3ad-7fc0375db1a0-0
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.400
Umm.

6db995a9-0f3a-4d0f-9ab2-70d2f065a3cd-0
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.220
They are cheering one another.

03627848-2290-41aa-966d-bd073030da93-0
01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:05.700
And you can just see the glasses
with liquid in them.

dded6f75-e37d-44db-87ed-76edef4f0dd3-0
01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.790
It's probably the two men, the
boy and the woman.

5e9050c7-4fea-47ec-914d-76c2701d5713-0
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:14.706
Now she's taking out objects
from the basket and chopping

5e9050c7-4fea-47ec-914d-76c2701d5713-1
01:34:14.706 --> 01:34:19.481
them up. Looks like something
round with spikes on the

5e9050c7-4fea-47ec-914d-76c2701d5713-2
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:22.260
outside. Some sort of vegetable.

06aef4aa-7595-439b-ada8-21f1f30acf36-0
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:26.160
She's.

29bb6d0d-d3ed-4d2e-bcf8-73874e07fd99-0
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:28.990
Grating.

7326923c-e1d0-48eb-812f-7d964f4e87be-0
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:30.620
One of the.

42cc2afd-7b5c-46a7-acb1-52aa3ae31ee8-0
01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:36.830
Vegetables from the basket,
grating it on a on a grater.

4c0bd128-0831-4309-8193-da31850a3fb5-0
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:40.330


f036a7d3-bfff-4890-8d52-d2b29e25f629-0
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:43.447
I don't know what that is. I
don't know about the last

f036a7d3-bfff-4890-8d52-d2b29e25f629-1
01:34:43.447 --> 01:34:43.790
picture.

2ed7856f-f566-40f7-8183-93a75d349d35-0
01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:52.710
Now you can see a series of
individual pictures, but then

2ed7856f-f566-40f7-8183-93a75d349d35-1
01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:54.050
also a larger picture.

f889811e-dfe3-49ad-95c2-d72e8944746c-0
01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.828
So the end of individual
pictures are just focusing on

f889811e-dfe3-49ad-95c2-d72e8944746c-1
01:34:58.828 --> 01:35:00.350
one person or one object.

84253ec9-4f60-42d2-ab0c-b97e19724658-0
01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:04.455
You can see the man with the
white shirt and the suspenders

84253ec9-4f60-42d2-ab0c-b97e19724658-1
01:35:04.455 --> 01:35:07.720
and glasses. He's got a wine
glass. He's sitting at a table

84253ec9-4f60-42d2-ab0c-b97e19724658-2
01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.700
and he's laughing.

dd7fe0ab-85fa-4d86-bbad-ce5394c47445-0
01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:13.135
The woman is also sitting at the
table with a wine glass and

dd7fe0ab-85fa-4d86-bbad-ce5394c47445-1
01:35:13.135 --> 01:35:14.020
she's laughing.

811c7ec1-af2e-4f34-a288-78cf25370499-0
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:16.830
And then the man with the dark
suit.

42ca723a-13dd-41ee-9870-86f14dd6fcea-0
01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:22.296
Is sitting at the table with a
plate and a fork with some food

42ca723a-13dd-41ee-9870-86f14dd6fcea-1
01:35:22.296 --> 01:35:23.280
on his plate.

086d7d97-2612-4f43-a1ab-e7c811e014a8-0
01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:29.737
He took off his suit jacket but
still has his dark vest on. And

086d7d97-2612-4f43-a1ab-e7c811e014a8-1
01:35:29.737 --> 01:35:30.660
he's eating.

7a5e7e02-dc33-440c-ae0f-7e06381508b1-0
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:36.221
Now the man with the glasses and
the white shirt and suspenders

7a5e7e02-dc33-440c-ae0f-7e06381508b1-1
01:35:36.221 --> 01:35:40.833
is playing an object that looks
a musical instrument that looks

7a5e7e02-dc33-440c-ae0f-7e06381508b1-2
01:35:40.833 --> 01:35:42.129
like an accordion.

5ffb4bfc-9a9e-4d8f-94b0-ca36b1ca430c-0
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:46.300
At the bottom, but has it has
horns coming up out of it.

50991c43-d953-4b81-8950-4a7842926f12-0
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.795
The woman is playing a flute
like instrument that she's

50991c43-d953-4b81-8950-4a7842926f12-1
01:35:51.795 --> 01:35:56.750
blowing into and that also has
kind of a horn shape coming up

50991c43-d953-4b81-8950-4a7842926f12-2
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:57.550
out of it.

19647b09-1b19-44e0-a624-05848e1f7f1d-0
01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.910
The young boy is playing a
banjo.

2d490a70-ce6c-4560-abe9-f16d99fcb304-0
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:07.045
And sitting next to him is an
animal that looks kind of like a

2d490a70-ce6c-4560-abe9-f16d99fcb304-1
01:36:07.045 --> 01:36:10.600
cat that's black and white with
pointy ears.

917bfbd0-0609-4340-91ce-df818b560b8f-0
01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:19.000
And you can see the man with the
dark vest suit vest.

e486266e-99b7-49ce-b5f0-4d509fa5b93e-0
01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.830
Has some paper in his hands that
he's folding.

d0dfa651-c27a-4f22-9f00-32cc1d43426e-0
01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:30.096
And I think he's folded it into
kind of an origami cat like

d0dfa651-c27a-4f22-9f00-32cc1d43426e-1
01:36:30.096 --> 01:36:34.557
animal and he's given it to the
boy, the boys holding that

d0dfa651-c27a-4f22-9f00-32cc1d43426e-2
01:36:34.557 --> 01:36:39.169
origami cat, and he's also the
boy is also wearing the man's

d0dfa651-c27a-4f22-9f00-32cc1d43426e-3
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.850
dark hat.

6859af4e-676e-4031-9fb9-a322483a0349-0
01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:45.038
The man with the white shirt and
glasses is taking a vase out of

6859af4e-676e-4031-9fb9-a322483a0349-1
01:36:45.038 --> 01:36:45.820
the cupboard.

1651ca77-b0cb-460e-a53f-bcbb22a62c5e-0
01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.490
He and the woman are holding the
vase.

3191871b-6ded-4f28-b060-afa8e3eea298-0
01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:59.125
In the larger picture you can
see them all sitting around the

3191871b-6ded-4f28-b060-afa8e3eea298-1
01:36:59.125 --> 01:36:59.510
table.

f68fae2c-c15d-4e77-a7b5-6cef9ceae6bd-0
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:04.240
The the boy's sitting in a
chair, leaning.

cbf71088-f2cf-43a9-8584-6cc2ca418d3f-0
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:08.490
Leaning over, feeding something
to the strange looking white.

595112f0-6a48-4e18-af37-ce97688984b3-0
01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.390
Animal that looks like a mouse
with a very long tail.

10678340-c4e0-45aa-9afd-f97bc70355ac-0
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:20.036
And the black and white kind of
cat is eating something the

10678340-c4e0-45aa-9afd-f97bc70355ac-1
01:37:20.036 --> 01:37:22.980
people are sitting at the table
eating.

053750e8-a187-42a3-a10f-86b3834e678f-0
01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:28.290
Eating, drinking and talking.

9fbb69a6-c657-4546-b611-f0682b4999b8-0
01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:37.124
Here's a series of pictures. In
the first picture we just see

9fbb69a6-c657-4546-b611-f0682b4999b8-1
01:37:37.124 --> 01:37:42.109
the vase and now we can see that
the vase or pot is sitting on a

9fbb69a6-c657-4546-b611-f0682b4999b8-2
01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:42.570
table.

8e06278f-3134-4d91-a1e4-1d5f54097bd2-0
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:48.750
I think this is the young.

637d0e7e-d79a-4060-bca5-db0d35893560-0
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:50.850
The young.

5d5cef09-ffa7-4e90-abeb-5f685901c90f-0
01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.000
Boy or.

80061224-ab12-4229-b2af-875920013048-0
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:59.189
Maybe that's the the man who
wears the dark suit is just

80061224-ab12-4229-b2af-875920013048-1
01:37:59.189 --> 01:38:01.660
waking up, rubbing his eyes and.

47b9b4cc-f6d7-4276-99b4-391b04570ca8-0
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:04.800
Up on the bed is the white.

3a85b3ab-b8a9-4f2f-8ca7-b0763f6e9f69-0
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:09.900
uh strange looking animal and
the man is petting him.

d9a07f6a-9bbe-4ad1-9b79-431999377bac-0
01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.080
He's getting dressed in his
white shirt.

84744aa0-9e06-4c5e-b5b6-2c9a95ea4786-0
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:15.840
And his dark suit.

9e4ceb23-d9f5-4723-b408-3c3a93e68890-0
01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:18.660
And he's.

581f65f2-e681-4d21-8479-fec3d99661f0-0
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.050
Cutting something to eat looks
like kind of like a.

e12fa548-5db4-44f9-9b4d-6ff8aa8755be-0
01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:28.960
Almost like a strawberry or
gourd. He's cutting it in half.

2dfbee5d-b533-4694-a24b-465ceb3d1b7a-0
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.313
He's sitting at the table and he
has some of it on the plate in

2dfbee5d-b533-4694-a24b-465ceb3d1b7a-1
01:38:33.313 --> 01:38:36.813
front of him on the table, but
he's also feeding the strange

2dfbee5d-b533-4694-a24b-465ceb3d1b7a-2
01:38:36.813 --> 01:38:38.880
little white animal some some
food.

8a9ee572-7126-4b0b-98aa-c37583f499c6-0
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:44.920
The man's putting on his suit
jacket and the animal is handing

8a9ee572-7126-4b0b-98aa-c37583f499c6-1
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.860
him his hat.

e9189fe7-7e00-41ae-92b4-78625490a65e-0
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:56.370
Now the man is outside the
building.

c5ae9298-5938-4aa7-9459-98898fdc8a13-0
01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:01.149
Walking outside with a lot of
other people who are walking.

c5ae9298-5938-4aa7-9459-98898fdc8a13-1
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:04.940
The man has this strange little
animal walking with him.

ba17a264-0546-4b42-bac3-691a8dbb3afd-0
01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.560
He can see a lot happening
around him. There's.

46ab626b-80ee-47ff-8852-a0ff567add5f-0
01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:14.560
A man with a sombrero.

bb69e68d-af8f-4384-b5c7-7b34eac66a59-0
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:19.490
Wearing a dark vest and white
shirt, and he has a large.

1157aa3f-f72d-4b06-b031-47a6a30e7667-0
01:39:20.650 --> 01:39:21.110
Umm.

a2e49133-30eb-4889-b51e-b36fdf2175cd-0
01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:27.480
Basket or tub with him and he's
got a ladle.

b89d7332-aa31-47d6-b8c6-3e70e2cfdff0-0
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:33.787
I think maybe a ladle or he's
pouring something out feeding

b89d7332-aa31-47d6-b8c6-3e70e2cfdff0-1
01:39:33.787 --> 01:39:35.550
some fish like animals.

412cc13f-e499-4a2f-b1ef-982970e5cd95-0
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:37.530
That are in front of him.

8cb66d0a-aaff-4bc0-a141-bfaf77ce8fbd-0
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:42.394
There's somebody who's drawing a
mural on the side of the

8cb66d0a-aaff-4bc0-a141-bfaf77ce8fbd-1
01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:42.980
building.

41279342-d1af-474f-8651-bac0e1e09941-0
01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:45.760
A man up on the ladder

6a7502a8-d100-44ab-b279-470db2642efc-0
01:39:46.630 --> 01:39:49.680
Drawing. there's a woman with a

b395bf40-091c-45fa-93d2-88f0e9d267f0-0
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:51.380
Cart.

05c97078-e440-43cc-a5b0-03d96fb8b060-0
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:56.990
I don't know if she's selling
something.

d56c1351-5f89-44e0-bf5e-25da088f66ea-0
01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:04.209
The man with the dark suit has
come to the door of of a house

d56c1351-5f89-44e0-bf5e-25da088f66ea-1
01:40:04.209 --> 01:40:05.370
or a business.

e9072737-d56a-46de-b362-2e858a1683a4-0
01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:11.222
And he's talking to another man
who has a white apron with

e9072737-d56a-46de-b362-2e858a1683a4-1
01:40:11.222 --> 01:40:12.140
pockets and.

11092340-55ab-498e-acf2-2ecc525978d0-0
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:18.610
Kitchen utensils in his pocket.
Men has kind of a pointy chef's

11092340-55ab-498e-acf2-2ecc525978d0-1
01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:18.900

b926a023-82bc-4043-ae51-da9ec6402e2a-0
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:21.500
Hat.

4728171b-1c2b-4a3f-a15c-00de4b19358e-0
01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:27.670
And he's holding a bowl and a
spoon. The man with a dark suit

4728171b-1c2b-4a3f-a15c-00de4b19358e-1
01:40:27.670 --> 01:40:32.796
is asking him a question with
his hand stretched out and the

4728171b-1c2b-4a3f-a15c-00de4b19358e-2
01:40:32.796 --> 01:40:38.175
the chef standing in the doorway
is holding up his hand like he

4728171b-1c2b-4a3f-a15c-00de4b19358e-3
01:40:38.175 --> 01:40:39.940
doesn't doesn't know.

9d16309e-0b4d-484c-b590-badb82de2f83-0
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:45.430
Now the man in the dark suit is
in another shop.

30b450e6-b113-4346-931e-f35df540691f-0
01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:51.697
Asking a woman a question. The
woman has short dark hair and a

30b450e6-b113-4346-931e-f35df540691f-1
01:40:51.697 --> 01:40:56.381
a dark clothing standing behind
a counter and she's got her

30b450e6-b113-4346-931e-f35df540691f-2
01:40:56.381 --> 01:41:01.299
hands up. Also like, I I don't
know what you're talking about.

30b450e6-b113-4346-931e-f35df540691f-3
01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:04.110
And behind her are shelves full
of.

9049dee0-e3bc-440c-a27a-79406c1df68f-0
01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:07.510
Vases and bottles.

adb022d5-7b9a-4884-86e1-5963cd2d32ba-0
01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:16.359
Now the man is asking. He's out
walking on the pier in front of

adb022d5-7b9a-4884-86e1-5963cd2d32ba-1
01:41:16.359 --> 01:41:19.150
a large boat. The boat has a.

9593ab3b-4d3e-4cd7-a326-adc4ca57dfd2-0
01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:23.150
Either boat or blimp has a
propeller on it.

17f6d7a0-becd-4f25-a2f2-a739d21fe197-0
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:26.310
And the man with the dark suit
is asking.

ab10dc65-63ac-45b4-bae4-86a9ec7fdef7-0
01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.110
Questions of another man.

11f1b15b-5fde-4749-8c19-2bad43f89218-0
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.945
And there's people working
around him, sweeping and

11f1b15b-5fde-4749-8c19-2bad43f89218-1
01:41:32.945 --> 01:41:35.900
carrying objects. The strange
looking animal is still

11f1b15b-5fde-4749-8c19-2bad43f89218-2
01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.800
following the man with the dark
suit. #END_arrival_5

9d60d57a-e219-4302-a5b7-9c4deee135b5-0
01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:46.170
OK. And?

6109bc5f-f1a5-4eb9-9e67-510759d208e1-0
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:53.858
