{OK, so this will be the last
item of our norming study, about

6 pages long. It's a story.
Please take between 10 and 15

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.230

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.742
bowl of some sort and we see a
flying creature coming and

cf352266-48a0-4a02-9438-e3db9132e5cf-1
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:30.650
sitting on the bowl

9986704f-5006-440d-b478-8e1d65b124de-0
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.484
or bird I guess you call it, and
she's bringing what looks like

9986704f-5006-440d-b478-8e1d65b124de-1
00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:39.230
pieces of straw almost like
she's building a nest there.

9c6dc212-7ef7-48ea-b130-ee06f92303c8-0
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.400
Background we see.

10d96b30-0b1d-4ae9-aae9-a39ab57fcdde-0
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.532
That looks like a man who is
dipping his pen into an ink oil

10d96b30-0b1d-4ae9-aae9-a39ab57fcdde-1
00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:51.877
while I'm getting ready to write
something, and he's got a lamp

10d96b30-0b1d-4ae9-aae9-a39ab57fcdde-2
00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:55.884
lit beside him and we see the
urn in front of him and he's

10d96b30-0b1d-4ae9-aae9-a39ab57fcdde-3
00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:57.310
writing with the ink.

1197ac37-0bfd-43ba-94f7-1abf449259ec-0
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.517
Also has looks like some money
in front of him and he is making

1197ac37-0bfd-43ba-94f7-1abf449259ec-1
00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:09.600
this piece of paper that he has
written on into a frame.

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-0
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.099
Opening his wallet, putting the
money into the wallet with looks

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-1
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.471
like although it looks now I'm
seeing oh, it's it's an envelope

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-2
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:24.569
and he is putting money and the
crane, I believe the folded

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-3
00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.941
crane into the envelope. He has
addressed it and he's putting a

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-4
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:32.834
stamp on it and he is now coming
down the steps with his

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-5
00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:36.864
imaginary creature and he's
taking this letter. Looks like

272634d7-327b-408a-be43-58cf1ddefa61-6
00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:40.690
he's going to mail this letter.
He is. He sees a woman.

cb07e3ac-4b58-40a4-bc92-2f167e8898be-0
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.454
On the sidewalk, she has a
creature with her in a basket,

cb07e3ac-4b58-40a4-bc92-2f167e8898be-1
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:52.601
too. Maybe he's asking her where
he can mail this. He walks over

cb07e3ac-4b58-40a4-bc92-2f167e8898be-2
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:56.100
to where the mailbox is and he
puts.

9b9d591f-001a-4ddb-91ac-8a944621759c-0
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.222
the letter into that mailbox,
meanwhile, he's looking up into

9b9d591f-001a-4ddb-91ac-8a944621759c-1
00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.220
the sky and he sees.

ec9e2eab-e303-4fcf-96b4-1f6b164cbe2e-0
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.810
Not sure what.

81506c36-6543-41cb-bfa4-2b5223dd4a4e-0
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.670
Is walking along with his
creature, and behind him is

81506c36-6543-41cb-bfa4-2b5223dd4a4e-1
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.884
sitting this mailbox which is
attached to a large white globe

81506c36-6543-41cb-bfa4-2b5223dd4a4e-2
00:02:19.884 --> 00:02:23.500
and they're all around him are
hills with.

b05bd1a5-5f09-44a6-ac81-e7c19faec5dd-0
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.480
what looks like trees, but they
look like giant leaves. Yeah,

b05bd1a5-5f09-44a6-ac81-e7c19faec5dd-1
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.820
yeah.

07710025-739f-4c9f-a052-78a771cb5abd-0
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.139
We're seeing one leaf and it
looks like the leaf is getting

07710025-739f-4c9f-a052-78a771cb5abd-1
00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.310
rained on and then it splits.

4c040bff-a2ac-418c-aa47-1692fa1d12bd-0
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.802
And inside of the split, it
looks like it's it looks like a

4c040bff-a2ac-418c-aa47-1692fa1d12bd-1
00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:50.821
seed, but the seed turns into a
flower and it increases in size

4c040bff-a2ac-418c-aa47-1692fa1d12bd-2
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:56.557
and turns into a different type
of colorful dark flower with

4c040bff-a2ac-418c-aa47-1692fa1d12bd-3
00:02:56.557 --> 00:03:02.294
various white dots in it. And
there are white birds that are

4c040bff-a2ac-418c-aa47-1692fa1d12bd-4
00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:07.561
flying by and the flower
continues to change and it has

4c040bff-a2ac-418c-aa47-1692fa1d12bd-5
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:09.630
what looks like white.

8fdfdd78-9fd5-4e3c-8907-00c2885ed9b6-0
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.287
Eggs around it and then it seems
to be disintegrating and each

8fdfdd78-9fd5-4e3c-8907-00c2885ed9b6-1
00:03:16.287 --> 00:03:16.810
page.

b9d9380a-091d-4e61-b449-fa0874efc3e0-0
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.650
has it disintegrating more.

ed7fc008-fc6e-42b5-8622-d358f8bfc529-0
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.450
{Oh, I think I.}

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-0
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.387
{Survive the greeting all the
way across both sides. I don't

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-1
00:03:28.387 --> 00:03:32.277
know.} But this, the flower has
been changing and changing all

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-2
00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:35.674
the way across this, these
pages. And there are little

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-3
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:39.441
creatures that have come into
the page that are they seem to

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-4
00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:43.022
be eating the seeds that have
come from the flower and it

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-5
00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:46.789
slowly disintegrates and we're
just seeing what is basically

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-6
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.618
the skeleton of the flower by
the time we come into this. And

3fe4a41c-acb9-480f-a9cb-00980cbb261f-7
00:03:50.618 --> 00:03:53.830
it also looks like we are we're
looking at seasons.

9cc82dc4-8176-44aa-bb1e-702766e59642-0
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.655
Looks like it's changing seasons
from spring to summer to fall to

9cc82dc4-8176-44aa-bb1e-702766e59642-1
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.100
winter and by by the end of
this.

39996332-7a62-4766-ad5d-4c62ad7dfac8-0
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.653
We're looking at a winter scape
with a just a skeleton of a

39996332-7a62-4766-ad5d-4c62ad7dfac8-1
00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:08.070
flower that's left.

d9981fb6-0750-4d65-93a2-a31516d6be39-0
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.488
The next scene is a city state,
and again it's a very imaginary

d9981fb6-0750-4d65-93a2-a31516d6be39-1
00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:17.170
looking.

dce5a884-a9fd-4683-a813-50396d0294de-0
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.648
City with a flying ship in the
background and it looks like it

dce5a884-a9fd-4683-a813-50396d0294de-1
00:04:23.648 --> 00:04:29.076
is possibly winter because there
is white on the ground and it

dce5a884-a9fd-4683-a813-50396d0294de-2
00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:34.073
looks like there are a lot of
little towers and different

dce5a884-a9fd-4683-a813-50396d0294de-3
00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:39.502
shapes and pointed structures
and a lot of little flying ships

dce5a884-a9fd-4683-a813-50396d0294de-4
00:04:39.502 --> 00:04:40.450
in the air.

ec93de2b-8075-456a-97d9-2815fe816e76-0
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.792
The next scene is we're seeing
that same urn that we started

ec93de2b-8075-456a-97d9-2815fe816e76-1
00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:49.180
with.

64ec3a20-b3af-4117-8f03-ad09408a96e9-0
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.337
And it looks like now if the
nest has come to fruition and

64ec3a20-b3af-4117-8f03-ad09408a96e9-1
00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:59.247
the mother bird is bringing some
food to the baby birds that are

64ec3a20-b3af-4117-8f03-ad09408a96e9-2
00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.230
in the earth.

3de348d0-54ea-469b-8a8d-3b45bdc27580-0
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.343
And in we see that urn outside
the window. Inside the window we

3de348d0-54ea-469b-8a8d-3b45bdc27580-1
00:05:06.343 --> 00:05:11.068
see a man looking at a picture
of possibly a family. He's

3de348d0-54ea-469b-8a8d-3b45bdc27580-2
00:05:11.068 --> 00:05:16.038
sitting on the bed with his
imaginary creature, and he has a

3de348d0-54ea-469b-8a8d-3b45bdc27580-3
00:05:16.038 --> 00:05:20.030
desk in the room. He has his
shoes on the floor.

c1aa79b0-c06c-497f-b6ad-11868ac28f8e-0
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.246
The bed is looking kind of
rumpled and it looks like he has

c1aa79b0-c06c-497f-b6ad-11868ac28f8e-1
00:05:25.246 --> 00:05:26.310
a nice little.

026b343a-73bc-4fe2-8a0e-099d59f00fb2-0
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.367
Room to stay in. He's looks like
he's washed his clothes and they

026b343a-73bc-4fe2-8a0e-099d59f00fb2-1
00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:36.717
are hanging on the line his
socks and his pants and he's got

026b343a-73bc-4fe2-8a0e-099d59f00fb2-2
00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:41.140
a nice lamp there on the desk
and we see the little creature.

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-0
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.203
Sitting on the bed and it's
waking. It was sleeping, but

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-1
00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:50.702
it's now waking up and it's
jumping off the bed and the man

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-2
00:05:50.702 --> 00:05:55.425
is wondering where the little
creature is going because we see

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-3
00:05:55.425 --> 00:06:00.224
a hole with a ladder coming out
of it and the creature has gone

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-4
00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:04.647
down into that hole. And the
man, we see him on the ladder

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-5
00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:09.520
going down after it and she, the
little creature is looking at a

80dc013c-225d-4891-bfde-c1f32d95dc2a-6
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.520
letter and the man picks up the
letter.

b8249dc9-321d-4ff4-812b-9fbf69c8251f-0
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.689
And opens it. And inside. Oops.
Inside there is the crane and he

b8249dc9-321d-4ff4-812b-9fbf69c8251f-1
00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.590
unwraps the letter and he's
looking outside.

ec959889-5fe4-43c8-9b76-598bd5ca143a-0
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.090
And in on this page we have.

192303a3-5b07-41ad-b963-dea068e8400b-0
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.919
A piece of paper that has been
folded up in origami to look

192303a3-5b07-41ad-b963-dea068e8400b-1
00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.725
like the imaginary creature we
have a cupboard with that looks

192303a3-5b07-41ad-b963-dea068e8400b-2
00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:50.440
like dishes in it. We have hat
and a towel hanging on a rack.

b1f56787-caf9-44f1-85b5-847facba712b-0
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.620
We have a bowl.

75a28e75-18d5-44bd-8a81-4fba516401db-0
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.491
With a utensil and some unusual
looking vegetables in the bowl

75a28e75-18d5-44bd-8a81-4fba516401db-1
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.760
and looks like an egg in the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.924
We have a picture of drawings
that looks like they were done

f32d9381-f172-4470-be04-671acd850c34-1
00:07:07.924 --> 00:07:13.508
by a young person, and then we
have some other kitchen items,

f32d9381-f172-4470-be04-671acd850c34-2
00:07:13.508 --> 00:07:15.130
possibly a teapot.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.538
And we have a cup of tea sitting
on a newspaper. We have a

00:07:20.538 --> 00:07:25.020

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.910
And we have a hand giving a.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.984
Boy to another hand. It looks
like a man to a woman, and

93742668-199a-4945-ad33-cb4853752d48-1
00:07:32.984 --> 00:07:35.310
there's a cup of tea in the

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.750
And we have a very happy scene
of a family with a father, a

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.279
mother and a little girl, and it
looks like they're sitting at a

 his hand, with three fingers
and.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.124
The imaginary creature is by the
side of the table on the shelf

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:03.462
above the table we see a picture
of the family, we see the

0e729f44-38ef-488a-acb0-016f37c4384a-2
00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:07.652
origami creation of the
imaginary creature, and we see a

hat hanging on the rack and the

00:08:14.618 --> 00:08:18.851

young girl has drawn on the

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.977
And we see someone putting on
her boots. Let's see, it's the

00:08:23.977 --> 00:08:27.688

her boots, and the imaginary

her hat. She's putting on her

the creature and they're going

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:39.199
down a set of steps and they're
looking at things that are

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:41.590

air.
