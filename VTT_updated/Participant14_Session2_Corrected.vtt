815a95ee-bbad-4913-9518-d8de5eb6dcce-0
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.015
OK so I'm about to show you the
complex scene. The complex scene

815a95ee-bbad-4913-9518-d8de5eb6dcce-1
00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:10.551
I would like you to describe
what you see and what is

815a95ee-bbad-4913-9518-d8de5eb6dcce-2
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:14.414
happening and with complex
scenes they take take between 3

815a95ee-bbad-4913-9518-d8de5eb6dcce-3
00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.949
to 5 minutes to describe what
you see. I would share.

838edca6-6e5b-4de9-9a43-cb60e2450a30-0
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.640
My screen and I will also make
this bigger.

0a5641ce-a9fb-4a88-a9eb-5245a9582d5f-0
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.280
OK, starting now.

daac404b-bf43-463e-b28c-52f6c7d75688-0
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.034
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
so it looks like overall this is

daac404b-bf43-463e-b28c-52f6c7d75688-1
00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:39.208
a scene with a lot of people in
a zoo. There's a caption at the

daac404b-bf43-463e-b28c-52f6c7d75688-2
00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:42.926
lower left that says escape from
the zoo with additional

daac404b-bf43-463e-b28c-52f6c7d75688-3
00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:43.970
information. So.

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-0
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.898
What's happening in this scene
is there's roughly about 200,

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-1
00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:54.579
possibly 250 or so people
ranging in age from very young

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-2
00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.423
to elderly, but mostly I would
say younger, bearing on the

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-3
00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:04.843
younger side, um doing all sorts
of activities at the zoo. In the

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-4
00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:10.180
foreground there's a rhinoceros
that had, I guess escaped one of

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-5
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.943
the enclosures and is running
through the pedestrian area

951a913e-6855-4d5a-8623-d5ecf5a9b1b2-6
00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:15.600
chasing.

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-0
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.327
Quite a number of people,
including chasing a snake, so

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-1
00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:23.572
they're running away terrified.
There's a couple of onlookers to

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-2
00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:27.491
the side that are watching
what's happening, and people are

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-3
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:31.540
trying to jump away from the
rhinoceros into a lion enclosure

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-4
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.720
and the lions are licking their
lips. I think happy that people

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-5
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.965
are actually jumping into their
enclosure. Sort of in the middle

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-6
00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.557
ground, there's a couple of
giraffes in addition to an

92306bb7-381f-413d-bb99-748f9f2aa236-7
00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:45.189
antelope and an aardvark.

9c722165-9dec-435e-95fb-8deb8c7bcee9-0
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.690
Reading a map and giving
directions.

7c26ae6c-23e2-45e3-8cf9-7546e00897f4-0
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.580
To a Penguin.

7a1140fc-7116-4c5e-a44a-53e2577fadcc-0
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.032
There's a couple of people who
are trying to feed the animals

7a1140fc-7116-4c5e-a44a-53e2577fadcc-1
00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:58.676
by dumping chips like potato
chips or something into the

7a1140fc-7116-4c5e-a44a-53e2577fadcc-2
00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:02.766
animal enclosure. Lots of people
taking photographs. There's an

7a1140fc-7116-4c5e-a44a-53e2577fadcc-3
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:06.410
enclosure with a hippopotamus
and a couple of flamingos.

12c1f427-8268-4c00-8399-5fd54e521d48-0
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.160
A couple of zebras and a duck
billed bird of some kind.

ced412d2-9e47-4cb9-afc4-f880c9e260f4-0
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.800
In addition to that sort of in
the middle ground, there's a.

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-0
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.732
There's a sort of an enclosure
that looks like it has an ice

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-1
00:02:24.732 --> 00:02:29.178
structure in it, but there's no
animals in there. The zookeepers

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-2
00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:33.282
are kind of nearby pointing,
their mouths are open. They're

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-3
00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:37.660
looking around. It looks as if
they're trying to figure out how

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-4
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.696
it was that this enclosure
became empty. There's a sort of

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-5
00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:46.005
a step ladder coming out of it.
And in the caption escape from

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-6
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.972
the zoo, it says, can you pick
out all 10 Penguins? So my

ba44ccc1-7431-4361-a99d-da8bfdd2d105-7
00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:50.520
thought.

c58209ed-64c4-4f4b-b7f2-0c68a2dddceb-0
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.152
Is that this was likely the
Penguin enclosure, and all of

c58209ed-64c4-4f4b-b7f2-0c68a2dddceb-1
00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:57.837
the Penguins are now gone and
you know they're all over the

c58209ed-64c4-4f4b-b7f2-0c68a2dddceb-2
00:02:57.837 --> 00:03:01.768
place. One of them was getting
directions from the aardvark, so

c58209ed-64c4-4f4b-b7f2-0c68a2dddceb-3
00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:04.410
you know he's looking to get out
of there.

3ea738d8-a419-48d3-a855-71903b1a6d81-0
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.479
In the background there's a
polar bear enclosure and an

3ea738d8-a419-48d3-a855-71903b1a6d81-1
00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:15.799
elephant that's sucking peanuts
out of a guy's bag. And to the

3ea738d8-a419-48d3-a855-71903b1a6d81-2
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.782
right you see a couple of
structures like a cafe building,

3ea738d8-a419-48d3-a855-71903b1a6d81-3
00:03:20.782 --> 00:03:24.160
a shop building and an ice cream
stand.

9c0a37a4-d485-4897-b5ef-7053d5db78df-0
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.558
Uh, there's another stand in the
foreground as well, like a hot

9c0a37a4-d485-4897-b5ef-7053d5db78df-1
00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:30.230
dog stand.

1f732979-36db-48ed-b2f4-0ee26c23cc1a-0
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.778
And yeah, just generally, this
is a scene at the zoo.

1f732979-36db-48ed-b2f4-0ee26c23cc1a-1
00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.240
#END_escape_from_the_zoo

c98bd09d-ac60-48c1-8f3c-a705ab80f06e-0
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.010
OK.

24e41012-78c3-4b3c-b2bd-6b9ca9071634-0
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.560
Perfect. Now I will pull up the
next.

c3afffee-d284-45ac-8d6e-9e5a5ee9c0c7-0
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.760
OK, next one is also a complex
scene.

c49f91e7-29b4-49fb-a984-fb0e0d815c67-0
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.890
OK and I will make this.

822152cc-4228-4c5e-9e86-db0b20a077a3-0
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.718
Bigger. So same thing as before,
just describe what you see

822152cc-4228-4c5e-9e86-db0b20a077a3-1
00:04:21.718 --> 00:04:22.280
happening.

ab86729b-e5dd-4e56-8a3b-25baa58707c3-0
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.391
#START_make_a_splash So this is
a scene at a water park. So once

ab86729b-e5dd-4e56-8a3b-25baa58707c3-1
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:33.277
again, there are hundreds of
people just doing different

ab86729b-e5dd-4e56-8a3b-25baa58707c3-2
00:04:33.277 --> 00:04:37.436
activities in this scene that's
taking place at a water park

ab86729b-e5dd-4e56-8a3b-25baa58707c3-3
00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:41.050
that's got a lot of different
kinds of things to do.

0acf16fc-11ae-4bb4-9ff4-7b777f8e159f-0
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.110
There's a number of slides, both
in the background and in the

0acf16fc-11ae-4bb4-9ff4-7b777f8e159f-1
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.808
foreground. There's like kind of
loopy, crazy slides. There's a

0acf16fc-11ae-4bb4-9ff4-7b777f8e159f-2
00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:56.506
slide that's coming off of the
side of a pirate ship. There's a

0acf16fc-11ae-4bb4-9ff4-7b777f8e159f-3
00:04:56.506 --> 00:05:00.690
rainbow slide that's on the
right hand side of the page.

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-0
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.274
Um, so the kinds of activities
going on here is there seems to

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-1
00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:09.917
be so starting from the
foreground, there's lots of

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-2
00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:14.262
people who are in inner tubes
kind of lazily going down, kind

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-3
00:05:14.262 --> 00:05:18.466
of like, oh, lazy river ride
under a bridge. One of them is

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-4
00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:22.460
getting soaked from a Super
Soaker, from this kid that's

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-5
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.944
like up on the bridge over over
top. There's some sunbathers on

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-6
00:05:26.944 --> 00:05:31.148
towels nearby in the foreground,
and some walkways going on

4245cf6a-4347-43a2-8cc9-13818489d137-7
00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:32.550
either side of this.

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-0
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.645
River and people are walking and
passing through and there's a

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-1
00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:40.405
pink elephant that acts as a
kind of like a water fountain

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-2
00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:44.292
shooting water into this river.
So if you're on one of these

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-3
00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:48.244
inner tubes you might get wet.
In the foreground on the right

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-4
00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:52.068
hand side there's like this
fountain feature. It looks like

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-5
00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:56.083
a couple of mushrooms that have
has water like coming out from

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-6
00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:59.715
the underside of the mushrooms.
One is the a smaller red

f0c26d0f-2fb9-4806-baa9-e8c85a09c104-7
00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:02.520
mushroom with white spots and
the other is.

dd94b081-a4f7-468c-9c53-24dfd39e04fe-0
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.603
Larger green mushroom with white
spots so people are playing

dd94b081-a4f7-468c-9c53-24dfd39e04fe-1
00:06:06.603 --> 00:06:10.316
underneath the water that's
coming out of these mushroom

dd94b081-a4f7-468c-9c53-24dfd39e04fe-2
00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:14.355
fountains. There's also a big
floating snake in the middle of

dd94b081-a4f7-468c-9c53-24dfd39e04fe-3
00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:18.460
this water area, so people are
climbing on and playing around.

d4ae6453-fd2e-4208-a6ef-979747c82623-0
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.887
This snake. There's a couple of
inner tubes in this area, just

d4ae6453-fd2e-4208-a6ef-979747c82623-1
00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:28.574
not as many as the river. And
this is where that rainbow slide

d4ae6453-fd2e-4208-a6ef-979747c82623-2
00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:32.814
kind of deposits people into
this part of the water like

d4ae6453-fd2e-4208-a6ef-979747c82623-3
00:06:32.814 --> 00:06:37.204
pool. And in the middle ground
you see people like hopping

d4ae6453-fd2e-4208-a6ef-979747c82623-4
00:06:37.204 --> 00:06:41.668
across different rocks. In the
background there is a pirate

d4ae6453-fd2e-4208-a6ef-979747c82623-5
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:42.040
ship.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.311
You know where people are kind
of like playing with the

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-1
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:50.084
different aspects of the pirate
ship, like climbing up the

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-2
00:06:50.084 --> 00:06:53.921
lines, shooting from a cannon
Super Soaker and then sliding

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-3
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:57.885
down the slide on the side of
the ship. There's also a dragon

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-4
00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:01.978
in the sort of foreground of the
ship that looks like a another

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-5
00:07:01.978 --> 00:07:06.007
water feature, something you can
climb on. There's a couple of

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-6
00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:09.972
people climbing on it and it
shoots water from its mouth, and

a065e3eb-68ea-413b-9cc1-8367889d386c-7
00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:12.850
on the left hand side we've got
like 3 loop-

09bbc34c-3e39-49c8-8893-34eb4f2c9b0e-0
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.648
The-loop slides: yellow, a red
and a green one, and a lot of

09bbc34c-3e39-49c8-8893-34eb4f2c9b0e-1
00:07:17.648 --> 00:07:22.578
people are at the very top left
of the scene waiting their turn

09bbc34c-3e39-49c8-8893-34eb4f2c9b0e-2
00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:27.431
to go down these slides and in
the back we see the head of the

09bbc34c-3e39-49c8-8893-34eb4f2c9b0e-3
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:32.207
Lazy River. So All in all this
is just hundreds of people and

09bbc34c-3e39-49c8-8893-34eb4f2c9b0e-4
00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:37.291
one snowman that I can see and a
couple of Penguins at this water

09bbc34c-3e39-49c8-8893-34eb4f2c9b0e-5
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.140
park. #END_make_a_splash

258170e4-d942-4acf-b40d-fb566f4414e1-0
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.470
OK, perfect. Now I will pull up
what we have next.

64866e16-f18e-49d1-ac40-f8c9e68bcedf-0
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.550
OK.

7b5d1428-58cc-4aee-a099-b1e029ef5bce-0
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.990
Next, we also have another
complex scene.

f228261c-9d4a-4ca9-b77b-0592644cc3dd-0
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:22.030


cf359af8-a4fc-45a9-a3e8-c78667c5e7b7-0
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.060
And I'm going to.

4238e7e2-dd19-4ef9-a5c8-1fc45ecca257-0
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.230
OK, so this is just another
scene, same thing as before.

f5adaeb2-7576-44c4-a656-51bee836bd80-0
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.793
#START_unfriendly_giants So here
it's pretty obvious that there's

f5adaeb2-7576-44c4-a656-51bee836bd80-1
00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:50.122
just like a couple of main
colors going on in the scene.

f5adaeb2-7576-44c4-a656-51bee836bd80-2
00:08:50.122 --> 00:08:52.750
It's like red and blue and
yellow and green.

5cd5b58f-daf1-4525-8680-210c54ab2b7c-0
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.046
And the scene is of these giants
in a sort of medieval feudal

5cd5b58f-daf1-4525-8680-210c54ab2b7c-1
00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:03.812
looking area. So like medieval
Europe or something is the way

5cd5b58f-daf1-4525-8680-210c54ab2b7c-2
00:09:03.812 --> 00:09:08.655
that most of these people, both
the giants and the humans, are

5cd5b58f-daf1-4525-8680-210c54ab2b7c-3
00:09:08.655 --> 00:09:09.270
dressed.

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-0
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.582
So what's happening is we've got
like 3 distinct scenes in the

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-1
00:09:15.582 --> 00:09:20.141
foreground, in the middle, and
in the background of these

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-2
00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:24.464
giants that are just wreaking
havoc on this human like

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-3
00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:29.102
society. So in the foreground
we've got 2345, like kind of

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-4
00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:33.818
six, I guess, Giants playing
chess. The Chess board is even

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-5
00:09:33.818 --> 00:09:38.299
oversized even for the Giants
who are playing on it, and

caa75b83-0a96-4ff7-8a46-45aa25f28578-6
00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:40.500
they're using humans as the.

2cc84b36-3018-433a-8f6c-180e97005781-0
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.590
Pieces for the chess game.

bf88887b-4d5b-42a9-abdd-4e89d01ab2e1-0
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.627
There seems to be some kind of
like swap swapping, like there's

bf88887b-4d5b-42a9-abdd-4e89d01ab2e1-1
00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:55.080
a there's motion indicated by
these whites swipes.

a57656bf-a442-4000-bd69-3fdf82712405-0
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.162
Around these giants and I think
that it just indicates motion of

a57656bf-a442-4000-bd69-3fdf82712405-1
00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:03.584
what's happening. So like
there's a a catapult that had

a57656bf-a442-4000-bd69-3fdf82712405-2
00:10:03.584 --> 00:10:07.557
launched something at one of the
Giants like a rock and it seems

a57656bf-a442-4000-bd69-3fdf82712405-3
00:10:07.557 --> 00:10:11.407
to have hit one of the giants on
the head and fallen down, but

a57656bf-a442-4000-bd69-3fdf82712405-4
00:10:11.407 --> 00:10:13.179
the giant doesn't seem fazed.

9a352033-8da3-47bf-9bc9-d5a679500bac-0
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.440
Umm.

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-0
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.088
There's other movement where
it's it's indicating that one of

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-1
00:10:20.088 --> 00:10:24.772
the giants is just moving one of
the humans from place to place

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-2
00:10:24.772 --> 00:10:29.457
on the chess board. Meanwhile,
there are dozens if not like 100

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-3
00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:33.848
humans in this foreground who
have pickaxes, who have other

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-4
00:10:33.848 --> 00:10:38.094
weapons, who are obviously
trying to attack these giants.

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-5
00:10:38.094 --> 00:10:42.559
The catapult was being used for
this purpose as well, but it

f57bbb8b-4730-4c95-880e-c0506eccb95d-6
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.560
doesn't seem to have fazed these
giants.

10eb5ba0-d10e-4d05-9d62-d51c0b306c6d-0
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.915
Still in the foreground, on the
right hand side, there's a few

10eb5ba0-d10e-4d05-9d62-d51c0b306c6d-1
00:10:50.915 --> 00:10:55.554
giants that are using straws to
suck up the water in these ponds

10eb5ba0-d10e-4d05-9d62-d51c0b306c6d-2
00:10:55.554 --> 00:11:00.050
or lakes and using that water to
to shoot out at the advancing

10eb5ba0-d10e-4d05-9d62-d51c0b306c6d-3
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.189
humans who have come to to fight
with them.

16f7468c-19da-473c-9e69-98b9c13db6a9-0
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.190
In the middle.

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-0
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.185
Um, there's a couple of giants
who are trying to lay traps, I

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-1
00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:14.573
guess for each other or even for
other giants. One of them seems

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-2
00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:18.623
to have a a rope tied around the
house trying to catch some

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-3
00:11:18.623 --> 00:11:22.876
humans. Some of the other humans
have caught one of the giants

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-4
00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:26.791
using a giant rope and it's
around his his leg. He's also

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-5
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:30.302
wearing a few humans in his
belt, I guess that he's

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-6
00:11:30.302 --> 00:11:34.419
collecting. The humans had also
set up a trap for one of the

8992752c-528b-4177-b564-a5f5e7808def-7
00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:35.770
Giants on the right.

12fd2f26-62a6-4e9a-850a-c5fa8a9755a4-0
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.694
Of this giant lady, and um, so
one of the Giants pulled out of

12fd2f26-62a6-4e9a-850a-c5fa8a9755a4-1
00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:47.528
a flowering tree to give to her
as if a bouquet. And there's a

12fd2f26-62a6-4e9a-850a-c5fa8a9755a4-2
00:11:47.528 --> 00:11:53.085
heart above his head, and in the
background some Giants are

12fd2f26-62a6-4e9a-850a-c5fa8a9755a4-3
00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:54.660
sieging a castle.

afacb758-fdcd-484a-bd7f-0bc72cd25e73-0
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.297
They're looking pretty
successful at it. One of the

afacb758-fdcd-484a-bd7f-0bc72cd25e73-1
00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:02.989
Giants is spinning the blades of
a windmill. Looks like he's

afacb758-fdcd-484a-bd7f-0bc72cd25e73-2
00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:06.500
having a great time. There's
another giant fake lady back

afacb758-fdcd-484a-bd7f-0bc72cd25e73-3
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.650
there too that has.

42ab2521-c475-4138-b861-d7f5e34d9d85-0
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.770
Attracted one of the Giants and.

e012eef9-8ad4-44d6-942f-fcd6b2dd6ab9-0
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.080
a hammer has come down on his
head, so it looks like he was

e012eef9-8ad4-44d6-942f-fcd6b2dd6ab9-1
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.540
fooled.

c1031cd1-5fc8-43be-9118-3d6a0bf7f6a9-0
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.103
And yeah, that's that's
generally it's it's giants. Um,

c1031cd1-5fc8-43be-9118-3d6a0bf7f6a9-1
00:12:23.103 --> 00:12:27.680
wreaking havoc on the humans and
the humans trying to fight back,

c1031cd1-5fc8-43be-9118-3d6a0bf7f6a9-2
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.910
either with weapons or with
trickery. #END_unfriendly_giants

7be0c139-11b9-47e1-ad43-59b4f304fac5-0
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.800
I.

333e73f1-fdbc-4d7c-b7e1-329cfc05b6c2-0
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.090
No, I'll pull it.

6b98a4ff-b470-4848-a8db-9283ee1b4857-0
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.700
Next one.

682aa04d-5b70-44b2-9389-43a8bf010a3b-0
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.100
OK, NEXT is also another complex
scene.

fdf88c01-4b17-4c9e-8a68-861961f54a6c-0
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.450
OK.

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-0
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.257
#START_airport OK. All right. So
this is a scene at an airport

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-1
00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:23.979
and lots of activities going on
here. There's not as many people

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-2
00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:28.629
as have been in scenes before.
There's actually plenty of space

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-3
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:32.915
to see the ground, which was not
the case in some of these

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-4
00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:37.274
earlier photos, but images in
this one, we can actually see

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-5
00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:41.779
plenty of what is the tarmac, I
guess, on this airport. So we

dc100373-e557-4497-8a8d-5fc61f896f49-6
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:44.540
see both the interior of the
airport.

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-0
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.513
So we see a couple of gates and
a baggage claim area in the

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-1
00:13:48.513 --> 00:13:52.222
foreground and then we cut
through the wall so that like

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-2
00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:56.126
it's as if its roof has been
removed so that we can kind of

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-3
00:13:56.126 --> 00:14:00.160
see what's happening behind the
building as well. So we see a

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-4
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.129
couple planes on the tarmac and
lots of activities happening

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-5
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:07.577
there. And then in the
background we see more planes

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-6
00:14:07.577 --> 00:14:11.807
including other flying vehicles
like we see an airship and a hot

0bebf6fc-747f-4523-816b-c663ab065aa0-7
00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:14.670
air balloon and a concord and a
plane that.

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-0
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.658
Has bird wings. All right. So
anyway, starting with the

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-1
00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:23.207
foreground of the baggage claim
area is in the foreground on the

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-2
00:14:23.207 --> 00:14:27.685
left, people are grabbing their
things. It looks like there was

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-3
00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:31.884
somebody who was apprehended in
those sort of middle of the

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-4
00:14:31.884 --> 00:14:36.292
foreground he has opened up a
trench coat and he's got tons of

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-5
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:40.631
watches on the inside and it
looks like somebody in a uniform

24bdb7bd-c9de-4ba5-ae6a-eb99b9265530-6
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:44.200
has a laid hands on him and he's
getting arrested.

f6a7b40d-9613-4190-a092-54bb1988a6f5-0
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.551
To the right, there's an
additional baggage claim area

f6a7b40d-9613-4190-a092-54bb1988a6f5-1
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:55.025
with people gathering their
suitcases, one of the suitcases

f6a7b40d-9613-4190-a092-54bb1988a6f5-2
00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:56.070
toppling over.

4821e768-5692-4c0d-9adf-8b29358fcd80-0
00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.020
One guy seems to be.

6d5f6f1b-8954-432d-95d8-95c8d1e5be92-0
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.949
in pain, but I can't tell why
from this angle. I guess it's

6d5f6f1b-8954-432d-95d8-95c8d1e5be92-1
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:07.130
maybe a suitcase was put down on
his foot, perhaps?

5fdd7c84-ad73-4bfd-b183-e44786a24e28-0
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:14.149
So then on the tarmac, there's
one main plane that takes up

5fdd7c84-ad73-4bfd-b183-e44786a24e28-1
00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:18.865
most of the center of this
image, and there's lots of

5fdd7c84-ad73-4bfd-b183-e44786a24e28-2
00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:24.280
people disembarking from that
flight going down one of those.

33250cd8-b33e-44d7-82c3-e8f3382f386e-0
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.714
Stairways that's pushed up to
the side of the the main door

33250cd8-b33e-44d7-82c3-e8f3382f386e-1
00:15:31.714 --> 00:15:37.825
leaving the airplane. So there's
a line of people coming out.

33250cd8-b33e-44d7-82c3-e8f3382f386e-2
00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:38.910
There is a.

678341bf-d93f-4138-830e-bfc37bd51ae8-0
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.966
Baggage trolley that's got lots
of luggage on it that seems to

678341bf-d93f-4138-830e-bfc37bd51ae8-1
00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:47.710
be waiting nearby so that as
luggage is.

37bbd384-6c4f-4495-80fe-fb1be7837219-0
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.916
Taken off of the plane. It has
somewhere to go and it's being

37bbd384-6c4f-4495-80fe-fb1be7837219-1
00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:54.812
tossed from person to person to
person, and it looks like the

37bbd384-6c4f-4495-80fe-fb1be7837219-2
00:15:54.812 --> 00:15:57.709
last person who wasn't really
paying attention and got nailed

37bbd384-6c4f-4495-80fe-fb1be7837219-3
00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:58.269
in the face.

35e5736e-d810-4c21-964b-8e604dc85823-0
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.890
There's doc doctors.

506b6188-bc7d-410e-938c-7ba2ffab0c87-0
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.494
There seems to be a pilot that's
walking in the foreground and he

506b6188-bc7d-410e-938c-7ba2ffab0c87-1
00:16:07.494 --> 00:16:10.504
has an entourage and it just
looks like, oh, it's

506b6188-bc7d-410e-938c-7ba2ffab0c87-2
00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:11.950
stewardesses. So one of.

dc5a6ad0-f5f2-4512-87be-c9b2b13d2e4b-0
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.864
Two of the pilots are dressed as
traditional modern day pilots,

dc5a6ad0-f5f2-4512-87be-c9b2b13d2e4b-1
00:16:16.864 --> 00:16:20.861
and then the one in the front is
dressed as if he's like a World

dc5a6ad0-f5f2-4512-87be-c9b2b13d2e4b-2
00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:24.365
War Two flying ace or something,
and there's some flight

dc5a6ad0-f5f2-4512-87be-c9b2b13d2e4b-3
00:16:24.365 --> 00:16:28.177
attendants behind him. There's a
smoke break that's happening

dc5a6ad0-f5f2-4512-87be-c9b2b13d2e4b-4
00:16:28.177 --> 00:16:30.760
nearby, sort of hidden behind
some boxes.

e99ca412-26e7-44be-b0de-59ca0807bbd1-0
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.815
There's a couple of just crazy
stuff happening, like there's a

e99ca412-26e7-44be-b0de-59ca0807bbd1-1
00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:41.019
big fork on the forklift,
there's an ace of spades that's

e99ca412-26e7-44be-b0de-59ca0807bbd1-2
00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:45.150
sitting in the cockpit of the
sort of World War Two era.

21bc6a67-871c-45a2-91a5-1af873d45f76-0
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.742
Like a Sopwith Camel kind of a
thing to indicate like a flying

21bc6a67-871c-45a2-91a5-1af873d45f76-1
00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:53.480
ace. So there's lots of visual
puns.

2a70bd6d-fc95-40f3-a96a-4039031097c8-0
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.380
Happening within the the scene
itself. #END_airport

760f15d5-ef11-4923-8b9b-8b4c11bbc397-0
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.640
The short story.

266f5e9e-634f-4e89-b370-ac63bb0c18a6-0
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:35.680


9fb85569-139c-4c36-8ccb-e4ffd0a65bfb-0
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.420
OK, so.

690b832a-d806-42a4-b191-ee7f18d9e591-0
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.700
Gonna share my screen.

b1748040-78c5-46e8-8166-fbdc259a77ac-0
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.340
This is a short story.

3e436566-08bb-4e31-80e6-f8ff3fa528f3-0
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.973
Like before, like last time with
a short story described, the

3e436566-08bb-4e31-80e6-f8ff3fa528f3-1
00:17:47.973 --> 00:17:51.150
picture you see on the scene see
on the page, and then when

3e436566-08bb-4e31-80e6-f8ff3fa528f3-2
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.540
you're ready you could tell me
when to move the slides forward.

28245f44-54c9-4d56-941f-33d568113b9a-0
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.578
#START_return OK. All right. So
this is a a story I think told

28245f44-54c9-4d56-941f-33d568113b9a-1
00:18:05.578 --> 00:18:10.134
without words. You can see that
the title of it is for my

28245f44-54c9-4d56-941f-33d568113b9a-2
00:18:10.134 --> 00:18:15.082
parents and there's some sort of
caption below that that's not

28245f44-54c9-4d56-941f-33d568113b9a-3
00:18:15.082 --> 00:18:20.030
possible for me to read on the
phone but or on the the screen.

28245f44-54c9-4d56-941f-33d568113b9a-4
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.979
So what we see is a cutaway view
of an apartment building. The

28245f44-54c9-4d56-941f-33d568113b9a-5
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.099
color story here is mostly.

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-0
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.442
Sepia tones, although there are
some bright colors here and

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-1
00:18:31.442 --> 00:18:36.071
there. So the cut across that we
see are the cut out that we see

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-2
00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:40.201
is of a two-story apartment
building. Or at least we only

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-3
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:44.687
see two stories here. The the
main floor. There's a bit of a a

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-4
00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:49.102
stoop to the left that you would
use to get into the the main

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-5
00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:53.232
entranceway and then on top of
that we see that there's a

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-6
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:57.505
second floor. Starting on the
1st floor you would come into

6b51b766-712f-4d7a-8248-469e6fccfb76-7
00:18:57.505 --> 00:18:57.789
the.

0555ebc7-25ac-4b35-b8e4-0e98a2723f08-0
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.392
The main part of the apartment.
And there's there's an

0555ebc7-25ac-4b35-b8e4-0e98a2723f08-1
00:19:01.392 --> 00:19:04.960
entranceway with a coat rack
with a coat and a hat on it.

ecaa0ca6-7ae2-4410-bcff-419a84ca4453-0
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.700
Entryway table with a Tiffany
lamp style lamp that's there, a

ecaa0ca6-7ae2-4410-bcff-419a84ca4453-1
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.921
couple of pictures hanging on a
wall and some wallpaper. Just

ecaa0ca6-7ae2-4410-bcff-419a84ca4453-2
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:19.005
looking generally at the whole
house. It looks to be like a

ecaa0ca6-7ae2-4410-bcff-419a84ca4453-3
00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:19.549
sort of.

12322a6a-b39d-4df6-99ff-000165cbd679-0
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.110
Early to mid century, I would
say this is sort of a 1940s

12322a6a-b39d-4df6-99ff-000165cbd679-1
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.050
looking appeal.

da3876b8-d0eb-4d2e-ba24-a3edbc172aa5-0
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.414
Moving on from the entranceway
to the right, still on the 1st

da3876b8-d0eb-4d2e-ba24-a3edbc172aa5-1
00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:33.240
floor, you would enter. It looks
like a kitchen.

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-0
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.341
But there's a, a stove and some
cabinets and a sink and some

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-1
00:19:39.341 --> 00:19:44.154
more cabinets on top of that.
And then after that you see a, a

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-2
00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:48.816
stairway in a small hallway
going up. And then the last room

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-3
00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:52.942
on this floor looks to be a
child's bedroom. There's,

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-4
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:57.526
there's a bed, there's a map
hanging on the wall in the and

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-5
00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:02.340
over top of the bed. And this is
where we get like a couple of

7e22d609-d413-4777-8b86-076a3e15ac56-6
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.550
different colors coming in. So
there's a.

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-0
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:10.377
Red hot air balloon that's
hanging as a mobile over top of

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-1
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:15.265
the child's bed. There's also
some purple in this room, like

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-2
00:20:15.265 --> 00:20:19.913
purple stuffed animal maybe on
the bed and a stuffed or a

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-3
00:20:19.913 --> 00:20:24.561
purple, I don't know, cross
looking mobile. It could be a

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-4
00:20:24.561 --> 00:20:29.529
plane and then we actually see
the child standing in the room

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-5
00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:34.177
on the far right hand side of
the child has more colorful

29b343ba-0d0e-4cd2-84d6-50dbaef34fb9-6
00:20:34.177 --> 00:20:35.940
aspects to him or her.

022337a6-6f24-4b4f-a843-655e953794fb-0
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.341
than the rest of the house does,
and it looks as if they're using

022337a6-6f24-4b4f-a843-655e953794fb-1
00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:44.278
a red crayon or a red pen to
draw on the wall, and it looks

022337a6-6f24-4b4f-a843-655e953794fb-2
00:20:44.278 --> 00:20:46.510
like they're creating an
archway.

9a9a3cdb-578e-4bd3-9f8c-7c285c1688a0-0
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.778
And they're holding something
red in their left arm and

9a9a3cdb-578e-4bd3-9f8c-7c285c1688a0-1
00:20:50.778 --> 00:20:52.170
drawing with their right arm.

c6192132-77b1-4e3a-8438-51031b25b2df-0
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.852
So and and possibly willing
wearing an orange helmet. Or

c6192132-77b1-4e3a-8438-51031b25b2df-1
00:20:56.852 --> 00:20:58.550
maybe it's an orange crown.

a1b93b47-f662-4a01-a477-232a1938e1f4-0
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:05.182
So that's what's happening on
the 1st floor. On the 2nd floor,

a1b93b47-f662-4a01-a477-232a1938e1f4-1
00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:10.303
directly above the child's room
is a sort of combination bedroom

a1b93b47-f662-4a01-a477-232a1938e1f4-2
00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:15.108
bathroom, and there's a cat
sleeping up on the bed up on the

a1b93b47-f662-4a01-a477-232a1938e1f4-3
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:19.756
in the bedroom section. There's
a sink and a mirror in the

a1b93b47-f662-4a01-a477-232a1938e1f4-4
00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:24.483
bathroom, and then moving to the
left. From there there's a

a1b93b47-f662-4a01-a477-232a1938e1f4-5
00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:29.210
sitting area that is at the top
of the small stair hallway.

804e2b87-1e0b-42cc-bd8b-ff7946f9d2a3-0
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.121
And sort of directly over the
kitchen. And in that area we see

804e2b87-1e0b-42cc-bd8b-ff7946f9d2a3-1
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:38.541
like a couch facing a small
television with the rabbit ears

804e2b87-1e0b-42cc-bd8b-ff7946f9d2a3-2
00:21:38.541 --> 00:21:43.182
of the old fashioned antenna.
And then to the left of that you

804e2b87-1e0b-42cc-bd8b-ff7946f9d2a3-3
00:21:43.182 --> 00:21:47.676
would enter this room, which
looks to be some kind of like a

804e2b87-1e0b-42cc-bd8b-ff7946f9d2a3-4
00:21:47.676 --> 00:21:52.318
workroom or a study. And here
there's a there's a man. So he's

804e2b87-1e0b-42cc-bd8b-ff7946f9d2a3-5
00:21:52.318 --> 00:21:56.370
leaning over an architect's
desk, like a drawing desk.

18eefe39-325f-43c6-8603-46d0b1062df6-0
00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.033
And it's it's tilted in the way
that they usually are so that

18eefe39-325f-43c6-8603-46d0b1062df6-1
00:22:01.033 --> 00:22:04.850
you can have access to drawing
over a large sheet of paper.

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-0
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.842
And once again, just like the
child, the colors on the guy are

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-1
00:22:10.842 --> 00:22:15.864
a little bit more vibrant than
the rest of the colors elsewhere

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-2
00:22:15.864 --> 00:22:20.964
in the scene. So, you know, he's
wearing a bright blue shirt and

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-3
00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:25.985
dark blue shorts, and he's got,
I think, brown hair and maybe a

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-4
00:22:25.985 --> 00:22:30.928
mustache or a beard and mustache
combination. And from here we

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-5
00:22:30.928 --> 00:22:35.714
see that there's a red kite
that's flying into this room and

ffbb2408-0dc3-4576-81dc-4446d70e658a-6
00:22:35.714 --> 00:22:35.950
it.

94cc3a16-ec70-43c9-9405-50da6d24bd3d-0
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.159
There's it's like mysteriously
flying in and we see that it's

94cc3a16-ec70-43c9-9405-50da6d24bd3d-1
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:44.048
kind of connected by a string
that maybe just goes down the

94cc3a16-ec70-43c9-9405-50da6d24bd3d-2
00:22:44.048 --> 00:22:47.808
stairs from that first level,
but we don't see the string

94cc3a16-ec70-43c9-9405-50da6d24bd3d-3
00:22:47.808 --> 00:22:49.300
coming down the stairs.

1fbf1b79-5750-4a9a-b8eb-45739911b337-0
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.840
On the 1st.

51ccafc2-ba0f-4f5f-ad00-fd0ee5f6a427-0
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.670
Sorry, it's coming down the
stairs on the second level, but

51ccafc2-ba0f-4f5f-ad00-fd0ee5f6a427-1
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.740
we don't see it anywhere on the
first level.

c91346ea-350f-454e-b308-aa812879382b-0
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.955
So it just seems to have floated
up in that space. There's also a

c91346ea-350f-454e-b308-aa812879382b-1
00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:05.953
small door in the room where the
architect is and it's like a

c91346ea-350f-454e-b308-aa812879382b-2
00:23:05.953 --> 00:23:09.887
knee high wall that would be
used maybe for storage or maybe

c91346ea-350f-454e-b308-aa812879382b-3
00:23:09.887 --> 00:23:10.790
for something.

a8484132-af12-4c4f-b31c-5bb4de79217e-0
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.520
you know more mysterious. And
now I'm ready to go to the next

a8484132-af12-4c4f-b31c-5bb4de79217e-1
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:15.910
scene.

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-0
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.328
OK, so what's happening next is
we don't see any background at

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-1
00:23:22.328 --> 00:23:26.344
all. We just have the architect
sitting at his desk with a

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-2
00:23:26.344 --> 00:23:30.565
completely white background. So
we're like totally focused on

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-3
00:23:30.565 --> 00:23:34.921
what he's doing now. And it's a
scene in three parts. The first

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-4
00:23:34.921 --> 00:23:39.006
part is he looks behind him and
he sees the red kite on the

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-5
00:23:39.006 --> 00:23:43.022
floor and he's stopping what
he's doing. In the next scene

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-6
00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:47.243
after that, he bends over and he
picks up the kite and in the

c10a6f9b-66e7-406a-8284-3c153d613a58-7
00:23:47.243 --> 00:23:48.060
final scene.

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-0
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.002
He's missing from the scene. We
just see the dusk and we see the

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-1
00:23:53.002 --> 00:23:57.566
chair and we see the kite on the
floor, but we don't see him

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-2
00:23:57.566 --> 00:24:01.681
anymore. And then he's gone,
right? And the scene that

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-3
00:24:01.681 --> 00:24:06.394
follows, he is in the child's
room, so he went down there. The

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-4
00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:10.958
door to the child's room is open
and nothing is out of place

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-5
00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:15.596
except for the fact that the
door, the archway that the child

8ebf8312-3679-468e-8c25-62e43afe1be8-6
00:24:15.596 --> 00:24:18.289
was drawing, is now an actual
door.

5e8751e3-efd1-4d1b-9b42-28388e4ee9ab-0
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.413
That's been opened and the adult
is crouched down, peering into

5e8751e3-efd1-4d1b-9b42-28388e4ee9ab-1
00:24:22.413 --> 00:24:26.026
the door. I'm just going to call
them father and child now,

5e8751e3-efd1-4d1b-9b42-28388e4ee9ab-2
00:24:26.026 --> 00:24:28.917
because I think that that's
probably more their

5e8751e3-efd1-4d1b-9b42-28388e4ee9ab-3
00:24:28.917 --> 00:24:29.700
relationship.

7db22458-db49-45a4-b486-87b9900d85bd-0
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.920
And so he's crouched down,
looking through.

f99743b2-b075-4595-993e-f2d2461f1ac9-0
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.690
This newly created arched
doorway.

a4de89d9-0785-42fb-882a-c009cad1e19c-0
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.320
Next.

70a082e1-e2a3-45b5-9d80-971a912f276c-0
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.566
OK, this next scene is very sort
of fantasy looking. The colors

70a082e1-e2a3-45b5-9d80-971a912f276c-1
00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:50.523
are a bit more vibrant than they
had been in the apartment. So he

70a082e1-e2a3-45b5-9d80-971a912f276c-2
00:24:50.523 --> 00:24:55.180
emerges from the doorway, which
is at the the base of a tree,

70a082e1-e2a3-45b5-9d80-971a912f276c-3
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.536
and he's in the middle of a
forest and in the tops of the

70a082e1-e2a3-45b5-9d80-971a912f276c-4
00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:03.817
trees are hanging all of these
lanterns and and stringed

70a082e1-e2a3-45b5-9d80-971a912f276c-5
00:25:03.817 --> 00:25:05.769
lights. So there's a very.

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-0
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.638
Warm looking, welcoming glow
coming from this area, from

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-1
00:25:11.638 --> 00:25:15.969
these lanterns hanging around
and in the middle of this forest

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-2
00:25:15.969 --> 00:25:20.094
is kind of this Creek or this
stream that's running through

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-3
00:25:20.094 --> 00:25:24.219
it. And over on the right you
see a dock. It doesn't extend

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-4
00:25:24.219 --> 00:25:28.687
out into the Creek very far, but
it's just, you know, there is a

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-5
00:25:28.687 --> 00:25:33.018
boat launch or some kind of just
dock, and on top of that is a

223ab60b-deff-4a38-a17d-86b43497cb83-6
00:25:33.018 --> 00:25:37.350
red ball. There's no sign of the
child anywhere. This is just.

355a102a-1046-41cf-988b-0b5fe01a9c9a-0
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.455
Everything that's here and the
red ball is some kind of like a

355a102a-1046-41cf-988b-0b5fe01a9c9a-1
00:25:41.455 --> 00:25:42.160
clue. Next.

16053a45-57e9-4615-9cb4-1abc96f134a9-0
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:53.366
So now the father is standing up
on the dock, holding the ball

16053a45-57e9-4615-9cb4-1abc96f134a9-1
00:25:53.366 --> 00:26:00.122
and down the stream, he sees
this boat that's coming towards

16053a45-57e9-4615-9cb4-1abc96f134a9-2
00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:02.779
him. The the boat has a.

a76917dd-5e5c-425a-8e7a-bce126226490-0
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:09.256
Maidenhead figure as part of the
the bow of the boat and it looks

a76917dd-5e5c-425a-8e7a-bce126226490-1
00:26:09.256 --> 00:26:14.429
like a creature, like it looks
kind of like a horse head but

a76917dd-5e5c-425a-8e7a-bce126226490-2
00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:19.263
with a much longer and more
narrow nozzle muzzle and you

a76917dd-5e5c-425a-8e7a-bce126226490-3
00:26:19.263 --> 00:26:20.620
know it's got a.

572c0c01-293e-49e0-9fc5-6326e833f889-0
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.940
Really tall, very narrow ears.

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-0
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.781
So it's on its way towards him
and in the next scene, once

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-1
00:26:31.781 --> 00:26:36.007
again, this is a scene told in
three scenes. There's no

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-2
00:26:36.007 --> 00:26:40.760
background to this, we just see
what's happening with the man.

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-3
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.835
The only things that are
depicted in the scene is the

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-4
00:26:44.835 --> 00:26:49.438
boat and the man and the ball
that he's holding. So the boat

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-5
00:26:49.438 --> 00:26:54.116
approaches, he is still standing
on the dock, and in the next

c5575c25-e5b7-4d88-86ab-866e1144eeab-6
00:26:54.116 --> 00:26:57.210
scene he the boat seems to have
stopped.

4a660375-6db8-4c8e-a6f5-9073e69d70f8-0
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.003
In front of him and he's looking
at it and in the following in

4a660375-6db8-4c8e-a6f5-9073e69d70f8-1
00:27:01.003 --> 00:27:01.890
the last scene.

73a0e3a0-22e8-49aa-86be-48efe36c8335-0
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.092
He is on the boat and the boat
is continuing its journey down

73a0e3a0-22e8-49aa-86be-48efe36c8335-1
00:27:06.092 --> 00:27:09.480
the Creek and all the while he's
still holding the red ball.

4f3881fa-4625-465f-861f-ac036c534547-0
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:16.597
All right, in this scene, which
takes place over 2 panels, is

4f3881fa-4625-465f-861f-ac036c534547-1
00:27:16.597 --> 00:27:21.964
just this large backdrop of a
castle. You know, it looks like

4f3881fa-4625-465f-861f-ac036c534547-2
00:27:21.964 --> 00:27:27.245
a very fanciful castle, and the
boat is approaching from the

4f3881fa-4625-465f-861f-ac036c534547-3
00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:32.613
left. The Creek goes into the
castle via its Moat system, but

4f3881fa-4625-465f-861f-ac036c534547-4
00:27:32.613 --> 00:27:37.894
it looks as if he's going to be
able to enter the the castle

4f3881fa-4625-465f-861f-ac036c534547-5
00:27:37.894 --> 00:27:41.530
through a gated entryway into
the castle.

6c071a8d-e827-4f8a-aa64-7eedad1e220b-0
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.970
Like this was meant to happen.

2c1653cd-c844-4f5f-9b4f-1813aad8fcc0-0
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.140
And.

dda6353c-1a54-40b8-a896-996d1c5c542f-0
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.508
The color story here is, you
know, there's bright oranges and

dda6353c-1a54-40b8-a896-996d1c5c542f-1
00:27:51.508 --> 00:27:55.977
Blues, and this is taking place
at night because the moon is up

dda6353c-1a54-40b8-a896-996d1c5c542f-2
00:27:55.977 --> 00:27:58.910
and the sky is full of Blues and
purples.

2fb3f15e-6fc4-4741-890b-6d9fd6b42cd5-0
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.886
And on a on the right we see
that the main castle is

2fb3f15e-6fc4-4741-890b-6d9fd6b42cd5-1
00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:08.319
connected via some kind of a
bridge or possibly an aqueduct

2fb3f15e-6fc4-4741-890b-6d9fd6b42cd5-2
00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:12.974
to another section of like the
castle area. And on top of that

2fb3f15e-6fc4-4741-890b-6d9fd6b42cd5-3
00:28:12.974 --> 00:28:17.407
bridge is what looks like a red
vehicle. It's a very simple

2fb3f15e-6fc4-4741-890b-6d9fd6b42cd5-4
00:28:17.407 --> 00:28:21.618
looking thing. It could be a
boat. And on top of that it

2fb3f15e-6fc4-4741-890b-6d9fd6b42cd5-5
00:28:21.618 --> 00:28:26.200
looks as if that could be the
child wearing the Orange crown.

c9efc383-115f-4754-b4ff-6ff959d97fa7-0
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.850
So the father.

4cab5784-8076-47e5-b98f-42b3d7fe7026-0
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.862
In this scene the boat has
arrived to its destination. It

4cab5784-8076-47e5-b98f-42b3d7fe7026-1
00:28:40.862 --> 00:28:46.492
is docked in this area of the
castle and it looks like many

4cab5784-8076-47e5-b98f-42b3d7fe7026-2
00:28:46.492 --> 00:28:51.559
people are there awaiting it,
including a band in the

4cab5784-8076-47e5-b98f-42b3d7fe7026-3
00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:56.907
foreground and a possible some
dignitaries in the in the

4cab5784-8076-47e5-b98f-42b3d7fe7026-4
00:28:56.907 --> 00:29:03.007
background, sort of behind this
stone stone wall, sort of ornate

4cab5784-8076-47e5-b98f-42b3d7fe7026-5
00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:04.790
area of the castle.

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-0
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:09.311
Like harbor area. And the man
jumps out the boat and he's

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-1
00:29:09.311 --> 00:29:13.652
waving his hands. And up on the
steps you can see a couple of

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-2
00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:18.204
children. You know, they're both
wearing these orange crowns and

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-3
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:22.405
one of them is holding something
in his hand like something

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-4
00:29:22.405 --> 00:29:26.747
that's red. And you know, he
seems to be calling out to them.

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-5
00:29:26.747 --> 00:29:31.228
And in addition to the children,
there's also a man standing on

a20945ef-f6a3-46a4-a649-e55f27b354fd-6
00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:34.800
the top of the steps that is
older. He has a much.

39320001-252f-477b-8b00-a6f82111f125-0
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.315
has a long white beard. He is
also wearing an orange crown.

39320001-252f-477b-8b00-a6f82111f125-1
00:29:40.315 --> 00:29:45.350
And there's a the purple bird
that's like flying close to him.

02f1867e-1315-481e-8120-0b993ebcad83-0
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.702
That seems to be associated with
these people, and it's possible,

02f1867e-1315-481e-8120-0b993ebcad83-1
00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:55.796
I can't really tell, but I think
that there may be a throne

02f1867e-1315-481e-8120-0b993ebcad83-2
00:29:55.796 --> 00:30:00.230
behind them, the older man with
the crown at the very top of the

02f1867e-1315-481e-8120-0b993ebcad83-3
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.550
steps underneath the pagoda
area.

d3e2ee3f-cc66-4815-ae17-43e8d65a6136-0
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.957
Oh, I I missed the next. All
right. And and the next scene,

d3e2ee3f-cc66-4815-ae17-43e8d65a6136-1
00:30:11.957 --> 00:30:15.935
there's there's no background,
so we're just focused on the

d3e2ee3f-cc66-4815-ae17-43e8d65a6136-2
00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:19.913
action that's happening. So the
man approaches the, I guess

d3e2ee3f-cc66-4815-ae17-43e8d65a6136-3
00:30:19.913 --> 00:30:22.300
king, we'll call him for
shorthand.

6ee6a4cf-2ffc-4618-b73c-2afbc460a39c-0
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:28.844
While the child is one of the
children is nearby and has the

6ee6a4cf-2ffc-4618-b73c-2afbc460a39c-1
00:30:28.844 --> 00:30:34.428
purple bird on their shoulder
and is holding something purple

6ee6a4cf-2ffc-4618-b73c-2afbc460a39c-2
00:30:34.428 --> 00:30:35.690
in their hand.

149e83da-cc2d-400e-a333-67773f19285e-0
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:41.341
And then the other child is
closer to the throne and looking

149e83da-cc2d-400e-a333-67773f19285e-1
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:46.093
away huffily and is holding
something red in their hand. So

149e83da-cc2d-400e-a333-67773f19285e-2
00:30:46.093 --> 00:30:50.607
the father is like looking
pleadingly at the child who's

149e83da-cc2d-400e-a333-67773f19285e-3
00:30:50.607 --> 00:30:55.518
looking away haughtily, as if
the child that's closest to the

149e83da-cc2d-400e-a333-67773f19285e-4
00:30:55.518 --> 00:31:00.032
throne doesn't want to do
whatever it is that the adults

149e83da-cc2d-400e-a333-67773f19285e-5
00:31:00.032 --> 00:31:04.230
here, and possibly the other
child, want them to do.

4ae9c1bf-b899-407e-9169-2d406df213f2-0
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.642
All right. In this next scene,
all four of these characters,

4ae9c1bf-b899-407e-9169-2d406df213f2-1
00:31:13.642 --> 00:31:18.188
the father, both children, and
the old man, king, look around,

4ae9c1bf-b899-407e-9169-2d406df213f2-2
00:31:18.188 --> 00:31:22.230
astonished, so like they're
their limbs are up, they're

4ae9c1bf-b899-407e-9169-2d406df213f2-3
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.704
they're crouched down. It's as
if they've been surprised. The

4ae9c1bf-b899-407e-9169-2d406df213f2-4
00:31:26.704 --> 00:31:31.323
Purple bird is in the air, and
they've turned to face the boat,

4ae9c1bf-b899-407e-9169-2d406df213f2-5
00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:34.860
which had been empty but now has
somebody on it.

4e6a0e41-306c-4fac-8fa8-982c79101290-0
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.260
And it looks like they've
emerged from some kind of like

4e6a0e41-306c-4fac-8fa8-982c79101290-1
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.570
maybe doorway in the boat.
There's like.

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-0
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.237
Um, some green light that's
that's coming out from behind

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-1
00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:50.728
them. And this guy who's dressed
kind of like a soldier maybe is

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-2
00:31:50.728 --> 00:31:54.943
coming out from some kind of
doorway in the boat. And in the

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-3
00:31:54.943 --> 00:31:59.435
next scene we get a side view of
what's happening. And there are

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-4
00:31:59.435 --> 00:32:03.719
quite a few people coming out
from the inside of the boat. So

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-5
00:32:03.719 --> 00:32:07.865
there's the first person who's
holding maybe some kind of a

5c2eafb5-eb5e-41d9-bd4f-9789180c4f56-6
00:32:07.865 --> 00:32:12.080
light or a box of some sort, and
then two people behind him.

e5a74e7f-897e-4212-a55e-b89d2407ec44-0
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.029
Who are carrying lances or other
just long weapons. I can't

e5a74e7f-897e-4212-a55e-b89d2407ec44-1
00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:20.188
really say for certain what they
are, but they've got like sharp

e5a74e7f-897e-4212-a55e-b89d2407ec44-2
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:21.340
arrows at the end.

549ec212-08bd-4081-b3ab-0568f9ebf697-0
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.210
And they're wearing helmets.
They're either wearing helmets

549ec212-08bd-4081-b3ab-0568f9ebf697-1
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.250
or they're wearing like, wizard
hats.

777253da-3c34-4427-af0d-e8b26e7d4f46-0
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:33.193
And then the king is holding up
something triumphantly, like in

777253da-3c34-4427-af0d-e8b26e7d4f46-1
00:32:33.193 --> 00:32:37.128
defiance of whatever's
happening. And whatever he's

777253da-3c34-4427-af0d-e8b26e7d4f46-2
00:32:37.128 --> 00:32:41.972
holding up is glittering. So it
has, like, glitter marks around

777253da-3c34-4427-af0d-e8b26e7d4f46-3
00:32:41.972 --> 00:32:46.209
it to imply that it's like, you
know, it's luminescent.

7715db6e-d306-4d5e-8a57-42e80e0566af-0
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.636
And then the children and the
father are waiting behind the

7715db6e-d306-4d5e-8a57-42e80e0566af-1
00:32:52.636 --> 00:32:52.850
king.

2c5a2c8c-5348-48f3-93a1-d6ab54eede69-0
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.940
All right, so the king is.

06eb59cc-d476-4b2c-aec4-4596c821bb0d-0
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:04.803
Draws is drawing through the
air. He's holding an orange

06eb59cc-d476-4b2c-aec4-4596c821bb0d-1
00:33:04.803 --> 00:33:09.670
stick, and he's lunging forward.
And in doing so, he's.

5d90d3c9-479d-40bf-9f1a-025fd3aae35d-0
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.283
Creating a line behind him in
the air. The soldier in the

5d90d3c9-479d-40bf-9f1a-025fd3aae35d-1
00:33:15.283 --> 00:33:19.900
foreground is we can get a
closer view on the box that he's

5d90d3c9-479d-40bf-9f1a-025fd3aae35d-2
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.517
holding and it looks like a
projector box, or it looks like

5d90d3c9-479d-40bf-9f1a-025fd3aae35d-3
00:33:24.517 --> 00:33:29.365
some kind of a light that has a
mechanism on it that you would

5d90d3c9-479d-40bf-9f1a-025fd3aae35d-4
00:33:29.365 --> 00:33:29.750
turn.

a39a1e7e-0b6d-4f75-931c-90073398a0ed-0
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.266
And he's just, I think he and
the other two soldiers are just

a39a1e7e-0b6d-4f75-931c-90073398a0ed-1
00:33:34.266 --> 00:33:37.951
looking on, waiting to see what
this king is doing with this

a39a1e7e-0b6d-4f75-931c-90073398a0ed-2
00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:39.160
orange thing he has.

668752df-f314-4308-843c-17e13d7b59f7-0
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.319
All right, so in the next scene
we see the King is actually

668752df-f314-4308-843c-17e13d7b59f7-1
00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:44.130
holding a sword.

12d1e826-2124-4382-8be8-495ebc860e32-0
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.720
An orange sword that maybe he
himself created.

cb19b1d2-8cc6-4f38-9484-2f592d783569-0
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.210
And the soldier with the box at
first.

e670c9dc-48ea-40ba-93da-10396f0adaf2-0
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.917
You know, kind of takes a step
back and then in the next scene,

e670c9dc-48ea-40ba-93da-10396f0adaf2-1
00:33:55.917 --> 00:33:57.220
so once again this is.

cbc90e8d-7b6e-4aa8-ab94-1fb8896e2470-0
00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:02.773
You know a three-part scene with
a white background he is. So the

cbc90e8d-7b6e-4aa8-ab94-1fb8896e2470-1
00:34:02.773 --> 00:34:07.357
soldier lunges forward and he
starts to turn the the handle on

cbc90e8d-7b6e-4aa8-ab94-1fb8896e2470-2
00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:09.250
the box that he's holding.

27ea89d9-3730-4806-a74d-66c8153f9aa2-0
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.387
And now there are many things
kind of like floating on the

27ea89d9-3730-4806-a74d-66c8153f9aa2-1
00:34:14.387 --> 00:34:16.810
air. There's a, there's a green.

2ac14f26-2ed3-4d0b-8527-6c36b3bba79c-0
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.230
I guess a chalk maybe? Or a
marker of some kind.

500d6e6f-d7a1-4766-86e7-35aef8cc3d7f-0
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:29.503
Green and and yellow and red and
they're all kind of like flying

500d6e6f-d7a1-4766-86e7-35aef8cc3d7f-1
00:34:29.503 --> 00:34:33.160
from the king into this box
mechanism.

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-0
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:38.637
I'm actually glancing back over
at the scene to the left. And so

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-1
00:34:38.637 --> 00:34:42.856
we see that the king wears a
sash around his shoulder and

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-2
00:34:42.856 --> 00:34:47.221
waist and in them there are
different of these like colored

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-3
00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:51.221
chalk, chalks or colored
markers. So it's as if if you

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-4
00:34:51.221 --> 00:34:55.731
have this talent, you can use
these markers to create things.

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-5
00:34:55.731 --> 00:35:00.241
And knowing this, this box acts
as a magnet I guess for them.

159a1bce-fba6-4536-bf86-04d1afc0032d-6
00:35:00.241 --> 00:35:04.459
And so if the if the crank is
turned, you can suck these.

aa5d6e36-babc-4650-a675-d6d2fc9a9d7e-0
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.173
Chalks into the box, so the king
is now disarmed, going back to

aa5d6e36-babc-4650-a675-d6d2fc9a9d7e-1
00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:13.662
the the scene on the right. So
all of these chunks are flying

aa5d6e36-babc-4650-a675-d6d2fc9a9d7e-2
00:35:13.662 --> 00:35:18.295
into this box. And then in the
final scene on this page, we see

aa5d6e36-babc-4650-a675-d6d2fc9a9d7e-3
00:35:18.295 --> 00:35:23.001
that the other two soldiers have
laid hands on the king and they

aa5d6e36-babc-4650-a675-d6d2fc9a9d7e-4
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:24.160
are keeping him.

64f756de-22a3-4360-8972-8a5aa4e90f39-0
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:30.140
Sort of like hostage. Or that
he's under arrest as the soldier

64f756de-22a3-4360-8972-8a5aa4e90f39-1
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.906
with the with the chalk sucking
box races off towards the right

64f756de-22a3-4360-8972-8a5aa4e90f39-2
00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:37.810
where the father and the
children are.

27b4a14c-0105-4669-ac26-195090bbea7f-0
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.928
So as the soldier approaches and
we see him sort of in the the

27b4a14c-0105-4669-ac26-195090bbea7f-1
00:35:46.928 --> 00:35:52.547
background of what is otherwise
this white scene, we see that

27b4a14c-0105-4669-ac26-195090bbea7f-2
00:35:52.547 --> 00:35:57.350
the father is kind of in the
middle of the two boys.

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-0
00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:03.467
Children I should say. The the
child to his left is looking at

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-1
00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:08.272
what the child and the child on
the left and the father are both

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-2
00:36:08.272 --> 00:36:12.856
looking at what the child with
the purple Crayon is doing and

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-3
00:36:12.856 --> 00:36:17.218
the the one with the purple
crayon is drawing and it looks

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-4
00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:21.654
like maybe some kind of wing.
And in the very next scene we

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-5
00:36:21.654 --> 00:36:26.311
see that they have gotten away
on a Griffin. You know which is

561f2acc-a495-4df6-99e9-45a58044085f-6
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:28.160
kind of this winged lion.

71e9c29d-6d83-4325-913c-e2cfbbf631fd-0
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.810
Creature, so.

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-0
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:36.810
So in that scene the the soldier
with the box is lunging forward

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-1
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:41.111
from this area of the castle
where they had been, and the

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-2
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:45.708
three people, the the man and
the two children are now on the

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-3
00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:50.306
back of this Griffin flying into
the night as we see like the

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-4
00:36:50.306 --> 00:36:55.126
full moon in the background and
the waterfall from the castle in

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-5
00:36:55.126 --> 00:36:59.502
the foreground and the Moat
below and looks like an island

cc4bb89e-d19e-4766-91af-12bd022df891-6
00:36:59.502 --> 00:37:02.319
with a windmill also in the
distance.

e2a7a9a6-cfb0-402b-b1db-401a88de7525-0
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:13.217
Next we have a full view scene
taking 2 pages of the child or

e2a7a9a6-cfb0-402b-b1db-401a88de7525-1
00:37:13.217 --> 00:37:16.660
the children's view and the
father.

149e664a-f10a-4861-80c9-18625a910ab0-0
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:23.503
From there it looks as if
they're still on the Griffin and

149e664a-f10a-4861-80c9-18625a910ab0-1
00:37:23.503 --> 00:37:28.451
they're still flying skyward,
but behind them is the boat that

149e664a-f10a-4861-80c9-18625a910ab0-2
00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:33.399
has the sort of horse head on
it, and the soldier with the box

149e664a-f10a-4861-80c9-18625a910ab0-3
00:37:33.399 --> 00:37:38.346
is now on that boat and it is
flying after them in pursuit. So

149e664a-f10a-4861-80c9-18625a910ab0-4
00:37:38.346 --> 00:37:40.860
I guess this boat flies as well.

c1b66843-f55f-4b57-a7f4-3d23bf9ed5f6-0
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.922
Down below we see at the top of
the castle there's a mermaid

c1b66843-f55f-4b57-a7f4-3d23bf9ed5f6-1
00:37:45.922 --> 00:37:49.807
fountain and the area that they
had just come from, as well as

c1b66843-f55f-4b57-a7f4-3d23bf9ed5f6-2
00:37:49.807 --> 00:37:53.200
like a aqueduct that kind of
circles around this area.

f26da74f-daca-49c0-a916-8cec2cad1bea-0
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:59.089
And So what the soldier with the
box is doing is he's cranking it

f26da74f-daca-49c0-a916-8cec2cad1bea-1
00:37:59.089 --> 00:38:03.965
once again, and we see that all
of this purple is being sucked

f26da74f-daca-49c0-a916-8cec2cad1bea-2
00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:08.378
into the box. And then you
realize that that is actually

f26da74f-daca-49c0-a916-8cec2cad1bea-3
00:38:08.378 --> 00:38:12.945
part of the wing of the purple
Griffin that they're on. So

f26da74f-daca-49c0-a916-8cec2cad1bea-4
00:38:12.945 --> 00:38:17.899
unfortunately, it looks like he
is successfully sucking in part

f26da74f-daca-49c0-a916-8cec2cad1bea-5
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:19.680
of the creature that's.

3c2ebbff-ba7f-4a68-95d3-bc99d19e9a46-0
00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.284
That they're relying on to get
away. And not only that, but it

3c2ebbff-ba7f-4a68-95d3-bc99d19e9a46-1
00:38:24.284 --> 00:38:27.816
looks like the chalk that the
boy had used to create the

3c2ebbff-ba7f-4a68-95d3-bc99d19e9a46-2
00:38:27.816 --> 00:38:31.658
purple Griffin is also being
sucked into the box as the child

3c2ebbff-ba7f-4a68-95d3-bc99d19e9a46-3
00:38:31.658 --> 00:38:35.500
sort of reaches up trying to
grab hold of the chalk, but it's

3c2ebbff-ba7f-4a68-95d3-bc99d19e9a46-4
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.404
already well out of his grasp
and heading towards the man with

3c2ebbff-ba7f-4a68-95d3-bc99d19e9a46-5
00:38:39.404 --> 00:38:39.899
the box.

2d815fc2-a4e3-4fa9-943f-d564db8fd399-0
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:53.000
In this next scene, we see that
the flying boat was successful

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-0
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:59.026
in its pursuit. The soldier that
has the box continues to use it

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-1
00:38:59.026 --> 00:39:03.509
to suck up what's left of the
Griffin, which we now just see

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-2
00:39:03.509 --> 00:39:08.139
is a bunch of feathers heading
straight into the box. There is

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-3
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:12.916
nothing left for the father and
two children to rest on, so they

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-4
00:39:12.916 --> 00:39:17.620
are falling. One of the children
was rescued by the king who is

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-5
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.809
at the back of the boat, so he
had like reached down and

e28e8594-13a3-46aa-8dca-957a37348363-6
00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:23.720
grabbed hold of the child.

b17da614-c9ca-4f11-875f-719ba8490ec4-0
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.581
Who had been the child with the
purple crayon or the purple

b17da614-c9ca-4f11-875f-719ba8490ec4-1
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:27.910
chalk.

4e7c19de-0e23-4176-8369-c8fac1b16290-0
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.650
And on the right we see the
father and the other child, the

4e7c19de-0e23-4176-8369-c8fac1b16290-1
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:36.381
one with the red crayon, also
falling, continuing to fall and

4e7c19de-0e23-4176-8369-c8fac1b16290-2
00:39:36.381 --> 00:39:40.232
the child with the red crayon is
still holding tight to the red

4e7c19de-0e23-4176-8369-c8fac1b16290-3
00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:43.000
crayon, so at least for now, he
still has it.

8f38aaa5-7461-42eb-b2df-933fef2585c2-0
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:52.540
All right. So here we've got an
underwater scene.

78bdcc24-7574-4ef8-908e-b079e0ff26ee-0
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.629
So the top of the water
indicates that they splash down

78bdcc24-7574-4ef8-908e-b079e0ff26ee-1
00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:02.117
in the water and then we see
the, the father and the child

78bdcc24-7574-4ef8-908e-b079e0ff26ee-2
00:40:02.117 --> 00:40:06.604
both sort of floating in this
undersea scene. There's some

78bdcc24-7574-4ef8-908e-b079e0ff26ee-3
00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:11.396
fish floating here and there,
you know, we see the, the bottom

78bdcc24-7574-4ef8-908e-b079e0ff26ee-4
00:40:11.396 --> 00:40:15.199
of this area, this pool, or this
part of the sea.

14606ed0-6061-4271-bd29-70edd00ffa5d-0
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.117
The the bird that had been on
the the child's shoulder is also

14606ed0-6061-4271-bd29-70edd00ffa5d-1
00:40:22.117 --> 00:40:23.970
down there with them.

4ce0d075-42da-40ba-95ac-d9480b7fc4cc-0
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.605
And there's bubbles emanating
from like above them. So they

4ce0d075-42da-40ba-95ac-d9480b7fc4cc-1
00:40:28.605 --> 00:40:32.189
had, I think, just to indicate
like how hard the splash was.

4ce0d075-42da-40ba-95ac-d9480b7fc4cc-2
00:40:32.189 --> 00:40:35.832
The child had been wearing an
orange crown, but that flew off

4ce0d075-42da-40ba-95ac-d9480b7fc4cc-3
00:40:35.832 --> 00:40:39.592
of him in the previous scene and
now we can see that it is well

4ce0d075-42da-40ba-95ac-d9480b7fc4cc-4
00:40:39.592 --> 00:40:42.060
on its way to sinking towards
the bottom.

685de133-a17d-4b52-b5ca-747024bff327-0
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:47.012
Of the water and in the next
scene, which is it's just once

685de133-a17d-4b52-b5ca-747024bff327-1
00:40:47.012 --> 00:40:51.203
again a very white background,
we only see the father, the

685de133-a17d-4b52-b5ca-747024bff327-2
00:40:51.203 --> 00:40:53.690
child and the blue and the
purple.

a4bc9488-acc8-4aeb-9613-f2655d038ad4-0
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.780
Bird creature. The child is
using it.

90fbea2e-2c6d-4e20-a62c-9da10052bcb1-0
00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:06.516
Their red crayon to draw an
outline around them. It's like a

90fbea2e-2c6d-4e20-a62c-9da10052bcb1-1
00:41:06.516 --> 00:41:06.630
a

e136caba-d6b2-4294-a85c-25f0cb2c9da1-0
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:12.960
It's like a capsule looking
outline that's pointed on one

e136caba-d6b2-4294-a85c-25f0cb2c9da1-1
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.330
end.

72f57a82-58a1-48ce-ab19-1d5bf3b650db-0
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.550
OK.

ac55f9e8-f5a0-42d0-bb40-8c6b9b98975a-0
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:24.597
So once again it's like a two
page underwater scene. We see a

ac55f9e8-f5a0-42d0-bb40-8c6b9b98975a-1
00:41:24.597 --> 00:41:29.664
lot of coral on the left and on
the right we see a submarine,

ac55f9e8-f5a0-42d0-bb40-8c6b9b98975a-2
00:41:29.664 --> 00:41:34.486
like a big red submarine in
which the father and the child

ac55f9e8-f5a0-42d0-bb40-8c6b9b98975a-3
00:41:34.486 --> 00:41:39.799
are both inside, as well as the
the purple bird which has a room

ac55f9e8-f5a0-42d0-bb40-8c6b9b98975a-4
00:41:39.799 --> 00:41:44.703
of its own. The child is above,
using the Periscope to look

ac55f9e8-f5a0-42d0-bb40-8c6b9b98975a-5
00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:48.790
around and the father looks like
he's down below.

72fd4599-9c91-408a-802e-eed64354bd82-0
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:54.481
Also using some mechanisms or
some levers, or possibly with

72fd4599-9c91-408a-802e-eed64354bd82-1
00:41:54.481 --> 00:41:59.146
his hands on the wheel to
navigate the submarine and the

72fd4599-9c91-408a-802e-eed64354bd82-2
00:41:59.146 --> 00:42:01.930
bird is just kind of hanging
out.

4e8b6f39-0e82-44e5-b73b-be66d1e73ebc-0
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:12.896
So in this two page scene, now
they're on the inside of a cave.

4e8b6f39-0e82-44e5-b73b-be66d1e73ebc-1
00:42:12.896 --> 00:42:17.800
The submarine has emerged, you
know, and is now topside.

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-0
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.818
The father and the child are
both standing on the top of the

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-1
00:42:22.818 --> 00:42:26.840
submarine as they look around
and wonder at the place that

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-2
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.271
they had found. The Cave has all
sorts of different drawings all

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-3
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:35.429
over it. It's hard to say what
the drawings are, but they're

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-4
00:42:35.429 --> 00:42:39.587
primarily of people. In one
scene it looks like the king. In

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-5
00:42:39.587 --> 00:42:43.745
another scene it looks like the
king is doing something with

0c20cf1c-c327-416d-9aa8-1cf56ea47e0e-6
00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:45.450
some other people nearby.

19c20773-817f-43cc-9dec-efcbd3990d12-0
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:47.920
There's a.

5bfd549a-f2b0-4c44-a96a-202a70483c3b-0
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.159
There's a lot of interactions
that it's happening between

5bfd549a-f2b0-4c44-a96a-202a70483c3b-1
00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:59.411
people. There's a hot air
balloon looking device in one

5bfd549a-f2b0-4c44-a96a-202a70483c3b-2
00:42:59.411 --> 00:42:59.880
area.

c809d7a5-69ee-4541-80a5-3e048a330818-0
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.319
And then over on the right the
the drawings continue on The

c809d7a5-69ee-4541-80a5-3e048a330818-1
00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:05.000
Cave walls.

88fb56dd-7998-4201-bf74-149df70a7188-0
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:11.420
Some. Some boats maybe. Or at
least one boat.

65e2384b-9cef-442f-9752-6a3b95dd2ff0-0
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.690
Anyway, it's it's basically,
it's kind of like depicting, you

65e2384b-9cef-442f-9752-6a3b95dd2ff0-1
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.700
know, what these people are
doing and it's probably.

c84dee1f-fc5a-4484-8152-2021d87583fe-0
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:26.077
Eventually going to answer some
questions if there's like a

c84dee1f-fc5a-4484-8152-2021d87583fe-1
00:43:26.077 --> 00:43:28.650
close up scene of what any of
these drawings are.

58a9c878-15e5-43da-93eb-0b3f1a1ec825-0
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.932
So the father and the son are
now looking around more closely

58a9c878-15e5-43da-93eb-0b3f1a1ec825-1
00:43:37.932 --> 00:43:42.095
at these drawings. It's
daylight, there's light coming

58a9c878-15e5-43da-93eb-0b3f1a1ec825-2
00:43:42.095 --> 00:43:46.788
into The Cave, which we can see
from the right hand side. And

58a9c878-15e5-43da-93eb-0b3f1a1ec825-3
00:43:46.788 --> 00:43:51.708
the boy, or child, I should say,
is pointing, pointing upward at

58a9c878-15e5-43da-93eb-0b3f1a1ec825-4
00:43:51.708 --> 00:43:56.326
one particular drawing. And it's
a drawing of somebody who's

58a9c878-15e5-43da-93eb-0b3f1a1ec825-5
00:43:56.326 --> 00:43:57.310
holding up a.

e49e9c15-cc65-45ef-a0fd-fd159063d606-0
00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:01.376
Probably a piece of chalk which
is glittering, similar to how

e49e9c15-cc65-45ef-a0fd-fd159063d606-1
00:44:01.376 --> 00:44:03.630
the King's piece of chalk was
glittering.

0fc8461b-5579-4e59-adfe-b9dd9fc1e2ae-0
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:09.795
And next to them is another
person who's tipping out some

0fc8461b-5579-4e59-adfe-b9dd9fc1e2ae-1
00:44:09.795 --> 00:44:13.200
substance from some kind of an
urn.

23459596-0971-460c-ae95-d8fa066a965e-0
00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:21.168
It's either that or it's the box
mechanism that sucks in stuff.

23459596-0971-460c-ae95-d8fa066a965e-1
00:44:21.168 --> 00:44:26.941
It's very hard to make out what
they're trying to show in the

23459596-0971-460c-ae95-d8fa066a965e-2
00:44:26.941 --> 00:44:27.500
scene.

996b0a6b-4b68-4e93-90b6-d8d3b439570d-0
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.898
The bird is just kind of perched
on part of the rock and in the

996b0a6b-4b68-4e93-90b6-d8d3b439570d-1
00:44:32.898 --> 00:44:37.224
foreground we see a very small
door leading into part of the

996b0a6b-4b68-4e93-90b6-d8d3b439570d-2
00:44:37.224 --> 00:44:37.650
rocks.

fe42e3a5-ca5a-4b1f-b34e-3cc2025fc6d0-0
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.556
All right. So in this next
scene, they're still in The Cave

fe42e3a5-ca5a-4b1f-b34e-3cc2025fc6d0-1
00:44:46.556 --> 00:44:51.085
looking around. The father is
looking up at another cave

fe42e3a5-ca5a-4b1f-b34e-3cc2025fc6d0-2
00:44:51.085 --> 00:44:55.931
drawing. This time the drawing
is of a person that's in that

fe42e3a5-ca5a-4b1f-b34e-3cc2025fc6d0-3
00:44:55.931 --> 00:45:00.857
pagoda area kind of reaching out
for a bird that's sitting on

fe42e3a5-ca5a-4b1f-b34e-3cc2025fc6d0-4
00:45:00.857 --> 00:45:03.320
what looks like a potted plant.

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-0
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.921
And as he's looking up at that,
the child is hiding behind one

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-1
00:45:08.921 --> 00:45:13.799
of the the columns. Like there's
stalagmites and stalactites in

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-2
00:45:13.799 --> 00:45:18.219
this cave and one of them is
just connected. So it's just

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-3
00:45:18.219 --> 00:45:22.868
like a column and the child's
hiding behind it and so is the

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-4
00:45:22.868 --> 00:45:27.593
bird, because now entering the
scene to the cave's mouth, the

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-5
00:45:27.593 --> 00:45:32.166
entrance to The Cave is that
same boat from before and that

93c31901-11ca-4aa9-b3e7-632844483b81-6
00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:34.910
same soldier is still holding
that.

f7366d8b-07fa-489e-bd7f-272ee79e9afc-0
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.050
Box, so it looks like they've
been discovered. So

13706fb3-abb7-46cf-90b2-1e7a6e69737f-0
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.693
Next we have a white background
and it's just showing the action

13706fb3-abb7-46cf-90b2-1e7a6e69737f-1
00:45:44.693 --> 00:45:48.040
of the father and the child and
the father.

9b289d8d-3b30-47fa-b90c-0f27852654fd-0
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.970
Is pointing upwards with.

acc6b50a-3799-4620-b7f9-5e1ca3ee9f1b-0
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.458
Some chalk or something in his
hand. So he he's like saying

acc6b50a-3799-4620-b7f9-5e1ca3ee9f1b-1
00:45:56.458 --> 00:46:00.393
that he has an idea, but he's
not using the child's red chalk,

acc6b50a-3799-4620-b7f9-5e1ca3ee9f1b-2
00:46:00.393 --> 00:46:02.580
so he's he's using something
else.

4799dc83-9303-4b40-90a5-9a1ca1ff39b7-0
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.451
And he begins to draw a line
from the ground straight up. And

4799dc83-9303-4b40-90a5-9a1ca1ff39b7-1
00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:13.102
then he draws a line over and
then straight down with a perch

4799dc83-9303-4b40-90a5-9a1ca1ff39b7-2
00:46:13.102 --> 00:46:17.753
on the center. And on that perch
the bird has now sat. So the

4799dc83-9303-4b40-90a5-9a1ca1ff39b7-3
00:46:17.753 --> 00:46:22.404
child, though is like scratching
their head, like like how is

4799dc83-9303-4b40-90a5-9a1ca1ff39b7-4
00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:23.829
this going to help?

8e93eb08-806a-4493-932d-b6008dd3d2b5-0
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.510
So now.

a3b1ab1e-ebbb-4deb-aec8-75f749bbbfee-0
00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.952
The father and the child are
waiting behind the column, so I

a3b1ab1e-ebbb-4deb-aec8-75f749bbbfee-1
00:46:34.952 --> 00:46:38.881
guess they did all of this
without being seen. I guess is

a3b1ab1e-ebbb-4deb-aec8-75f749bbbfee-2
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:41.929
the implication what the father
drew is this

c385a905-2a56-463d-83eb-b0fa02959202-0
00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.933
You know, is this like box
structure or this other like

c385a905-2a56-463d-83eb-b0fa02959202-1
00:46:46.933 --> 00:46:50.728
smaller version of the pagoda
and in the in the middle of it

c385a905-2a56-463d-83eb-b0fa02959202-2
00:46:50.728 --> 00:46:54.149
the bird is kind of just like
swinging back and forth.

b0213211-e3ed-4f8b-ac97-c6113ae6c275-0
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.758
And um racing in, we see the
soldier with the box and he's

b0213211-e3ed-4f8b-ac97-c6113ae6c275-1
00:46:59.758 --> 00:47:04.344
cranking it, and as he's
cranking it we see the bird's

b0213211-e3ed-4f8b-ac97-c6113ae6c275-2
00:47:04.344 --> 00:47:09.096
incredibly long purple tail
starts to be sucked into the

b0213211-e3ed-4f8b-ac97-c6113ae6c275-3
00:47:09.096 --> 00:47:09.430
box.

8643d98b-8769-446a-bbeb-2419c360d595-0
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:16.600
And then the next scene we see
the soldier racing in, he is so

8643d98b-8769-446a-bbeb-2419c360d595-1
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:22.504
desperate to catch the bird that
he races right up in into this

8643d98b-8769-446a-bbeb-2419c360d595-2
00:47:22.504 --> 00:47:28.130
this box. And once he's inside,
the the the sides of the box

8643d98b-8769-446a-bbeb-2419c360d595-3
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:33.480
which had been lying on the
ground now all start to raise

8643d98b-8769-446a-bbeb-2419c360d595-4
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:39.198
up. So he's been snapped shut
inside of what ended up being a

8643d98b-8769-446a-bbeb-2419c360d595-5
00:47:39.198 --> 00:47:39.660
trap.

9d2e2456-43e8-465b-a89f-d07972d367e3-0
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:47.240
And as he's cowering inside the
box, the father picks up the.

6c29de18-6d2a-4f49-997e-cfd48eb9b486-0
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:51.160
Chalk magnet crank box.

4a7040d4-8604-40e4-bd22-51c8fa7545ae-0
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.851
From the ground, and he's
hurling it behind him as if he's

4a7040d4-8604-40e4-bd22-51c8fa7545ae-1
00:47:55.851 --> 00:47:59.659
going to throw it and the child
is looking on with arms

4a7040d4-8604-40e4-bd22-51c8fa7545ae-2
00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:03.942
outstretched and his mouth open
as if he's trying to yell, no,

4a7040d4-8604-40e4-bd22-51c8fa7545ae-3
00:48:03.942 --> 00:48:08.294
don't do this, Stop, because it
looks like he's really going to

4a7040d4-8604-40e4-bd22-51c8fa7545ae-4
00:48:08.294 --> 00:48:11.149
hurl it at the cage where the
soldier is.

8ce35642-f071-4b3a-acb4-1e7b3cb9c5de-0
00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.518
And he does. And he throws it on
the ground, so he doesn't throw

8ce35642-f071-4b3a-acb4-1e7b3cb9c5de-1
00:48:18.518 --> 00:48:21.030
it in, he doesn't throw it at
the soldier, he just.

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-0
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:27.242
He just throws it so that it
breaks on the ground and there's

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-1
00:48:27.242 --> 00:48:31.841
an explosion of light that
happens around all of the broken

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-2
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:36.593
parts of the box. And from the
box there emerges all of these

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-3
00:48:36.593 --> 00:48:41.499
streams of color and light. And
we see the Griffin from before,

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-4
00:48:41.499 --> 00:48:46.021
kind of like coming back to
life, and we see the bird that

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-5
00:48:46.021 --> 00:48:51.003
had been in the bird cage but is
now flying freely and all sorts

27f555fa-fa51-4c64-9cbb-8a6fa87cde55-6
00:48:51.003 --> 00:48:52.460
of other creatures.

144848e6-3686-4612-a423-78394cd07326-0
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.212
Bugs and butterflies, all sorts
of different colors in addition

144848e6-3686-4612-a423-78394cd07326-1
00:48:57.212 --> 00:49:00.680
to the like, just these
beautiful streams of color

144848e6-3686-4612-a423-78394cd07326-2
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:05.032
coming from the broken box. The
the two soldiers that remain on

144848e6-3686-4612-a423-78394cd07326-3
00:49:05.032 --> 00:49:09.248
the boat are cowering. They're,
They have their hands up, and

144848e6-3686-4612-a423-78394cd07326-4
00:49:09.248 --> 00:49:11.220
they're shielding their eyes.

875a4c25-b2ac-45ec-91bf-84a53085f3ae-0
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:16.716
And the king and the other child
are both on the scene as well,

875a4c25-b2ac-45ec-91bf-84a53085f3ae-1
00:49:16.716 --> 00:49:20.792
and they're being enveloped by a
stream of some of the yellow

875a4c25-b2ac-45ec-91bf-84a53085f3ae-2
00:49:20.792 --> 00:49:24.473
light, and they don't seem as
concerned. Or or at least

875a4c25-b2ac-45ec-91bf-84a53085f3ae-3
00:49:24.473 --> 00:49:28.482
they're running towards the
scene and not cowering away from

875a4c25-b2ac-45ec-91bf-84a53085f3ae-4
00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:28.680
it.

48bdbecb-fae3-4f8e-b4d6-54e43f89b6e6-0
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:38.302
Next we see the the father, the
two children, and the older king

48bdbecb-fae3-4f8e-b4d6-54e43f89b6e6-1
00:49:38.302 --> 00:49:42.878
standing still in The Cave
looking out at the ship that is

48bdbecb-fae3-4f8e-b4d6-54e43f89b6e6-2
00:49:42.878 --> 00:49:47.377
now leaving. And it still has
the two soldiers on it from

48bdbecb-fae3-4f8e-b4d6-54e43f89b6e6-3
00:49:47.377 --> 00:49:51.489
before. And it looks like
there's a sea monster with

48bdbecb-fae3-4f8e-b4d6-54e43f89b6e6-4
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:56.143
tentacles raised up from from
the sea, grabbing hold of the

48bdbecb-fae3-4f8e-b4d6-54e43f89b6e6-5
00:49:56.143 --> 00:50:00.720
boat, maybe to pull them under
or maybe to help guide them

d106c5ef-1876-4023-ac6f-35652ea93e02-0
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.033
Away and then up in the air we
see the Griffin flying off into

d106c5ef-1876-4023-ac6f-35652ea93e02-1
00:50:05.033 --> 00:50:09.122
the distance, but it's carrying
the bird cage trap that still

d106c5ef-1876-4023-ac6f-35652ea93e02-2
00:50:09.122 --> 00:50:13.012
has the soldier in it and
following the Griffin are all of

d106c5ef-1876-4023-ac6f-35652ea93e02-3
00:50:13.012 --> 00:50:16.770
these colorful swallows and
butterflies and other flying

d106c5ef-1876-4023-ac6f-35652ea93e02-4
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:17.429
creatures.

5c7eb7c0-5921-4456-ad35-c271a4158f52-0
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:23.479
And the four main characters,
the father of the two children

5c7eb7c0-5921-4456-ad35-c271a4158f52-1
00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:27.800
and the king, look, you know,
like that they've.

d4bdba72-7e5e-421d-97ff-e1ba113edd7e-0
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.680
They look relaxed. The father
has his hand on one of the.

9a71714f-a5ce-41b0-b2f9-e49e0bf1b84d-0
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.302
Children. And the king has his
hand on the shoulder of one of

9a71714f-a5ce-41b0-b2f9-e49e0bf1b84d-1
00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:42.205
the other children, and they're
just kind of looking, looking

9a71714f-a5ce-41b0-b2f9-e49e0bf1b84d-2
00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:45.919
out on the scene, looking at
these soldiers that are being

9a71714f-a5ce-41b0-b2f9-e49e0bf1b84d-3
00:50:45.919 --> 00:50:48.059
carried away or being taken
away.

333cf0a7-efb6-4d64-9bf2-a7bcabefaff5-0
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.337
In the following scene, that
doorway that we saw earlier, the

333cf0a7-efb6-4d64-9bf2-a7bcabefaff5-1
00:50:53.337 --> 00:50:57.425
tiny little doorway is coming
into play and we see the father

333cf0a7-efb6-4d64-9bf2-a7bcabefaff5-2
00:50:57.425 --> 00:51:01.183
getting a huge hug from the
child that still has the red

333cf0a7-efb6-4d64-9bf2-a7bcabefaff5-3
00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:03.030
marker in their back pocket.

8342e1ae-b1ab-41f3-8c6d-a67df4204c20-0
00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:07.975
And the king and the other child
are off in the distance. Sort

8342e1ae-b1ab-41f3-8c6d-a67df4204c20-1
00:51:07.975 --> 00:51:08.180
of.

83e054fe-771d-4117-8901-0fa4dd8b8177-0
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.066
Their coloring is muted at this
point, so like they're not in

83e054fe-771d-4117-8901-0fa4dd8b8177-1
00:51:13.066 --> 00:51:16.720
the foreground, you know, like
they will continue their story.

7217c29f-cdaa-45f2-8689-134febbf241c-0
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.443
Their part of this story is
done, so the father is looking

7217c29f-cdaa-45f2-8689-134febbf241c-1
00:51:22.443 --> 00:51:26.813
pleased. He's getting this
really long, sincere hug from

7217c29f-cdaa-45f2-8689-134febbf241c-2
00:51:26.813 --> 00:51:31.566
the child, and the doorway is
now open. It's ajar just a tiny

7217c29f-cdaa-45f2-8689-134febbf241c-3
00:51:31.566 --> 00:51:36.473
bit, and from the inside of that
doorway, coming outside just a

7217c29f-cdaa-45f2-8689-134febbf241c-4
00:51:36.473 --> 00:51:38.850
little bit, we see the end of a

bfbd6594-fea3-47d5-bc02-b051590aa2af-0
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:40.880
kite tail.

41b2a7e4-f3b7-43f6-91a9-21fa22a171bf-0
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.666
And then in this final scene,
it's the same apartment as

41b2a7e4-f3b7-43f6-91a9-21fa22a171bf-1
00:51:49.666 --> 00:51:50.220
before.

9a3a5682-5dd5-4121-b88e-d86beb34c244-0
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.270
To the right and to the left we
see more of the city. Um.

34e030ab-ac59-4308-85b1-6cbc022d5232-0
00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.320
The.

720152c4-e698-4cd6-ab5d-709453ed8f38-0
00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:03.040
The part of the apartment that
we see is just the entranceway.

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-0
00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:08.610
The floor above that which has
the architect's office in it. No

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-1
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:13.145
one is in there, but the door is
wide open and there's bright

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-2
00:52:13.145 --> 00:52:17.753
light coming in from from behind
and to the left. We see a red

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-3
00:52:17.753 --> 00:52:22.507
kite being flown in the sky but
the kite like string itself goes

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-4
00:52:22.507 --> 00:52:27.042
off off of the page to the left
so we don't see who is flying

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-5
00:52:27.042 --> 00:52:30.991
it. But the door to the
apartment is is open like the

5875e52d-b42c-4d1c-9f23-038bfe838894-6
00:52:30.991 --> 00:52:34.210
exterior door to the apartment.

aece37ca-a16e-4e3c-bfec-e19cfb87e80a-0
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:40.320
OK, perfect. So.

3515977a-9b13-42a6-9ee6-9a49cac9858e-0
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:44.892
We're at the halfway point if
you need to take like a two or

3515977a-9b13-42a6-9ee6-9a49cac9858e-1
00:52:44.892 --> 00:52:45.790
three minute break.

3ae6535e-fa44-4f65-a6ae-52225f0effb0-0
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:50.347
Yeah, I would love to go use the
bathroom real quick. OK, sounds

3ae6535e-fa44-4f65-a6ae-52225f0effb0-1
00:52:50.347 --> 00:52:50.820
perfect.

dd582bc5-df6c-4884-bb17-9b036e70752f-0
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.730
OK. I'll be right back. Thank
you.

a7125c47-08c6-4880-a0c7-b08e550df6eb-0
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.520
Let me.

c56dba88-e204-4687-ac84-72b9de49fc22-0
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.570
Share my screen.

8c16e1a8-bb94-440f-baf5-cd007b66e712-0
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.720
And then I'll make this.

62bebfaa-c3cc-4edc-84b5-52c2a700bf4c-0
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.170
OK.

2e1bfe9d-0784-41e7-bf15-ae5822193734-0
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.580
OK.

5296c616-7294-4864-b657-0d9bb7c811e8-0
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:18.840
#START_birthday_party_fun So
this is of the scene is of.

30f3d4f7-c18c-4b2f-9d6f-db05e167e464-0
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:27.080
Someone's backyard with trees
and a pool and a hedge fence.

05ab62d5-ee19-4260-ad7e-0d23b0dcd403-0
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:32.252
And there's a lot of things
going on. The caption and the

05ab62d5-ee19-4260-ad7e-0d23b0dcd403-1
00:53:32.252 --> 00:53:34.600
bottom right says birthday party
fun.

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-0
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:40.153
And once again, I guess there's
lots of Penguins here. I didn't

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-1
00:53:40.153 --> 00:53:44.237
notice that that was a theme for
anything but the zoo, but I

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-2
00:53:44.237 --> 00:53:48.521
guess these Penguins really did
get out of the zoo and went all

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-3
00:53:48.521 --> 00:53:52.202
over the place. So at this
birthday party, I would say

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-4
00:53:52.202 --> 00:53:56.486
there's probably like maybe 150
or so people doing all sorts of

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-5
00:53:56.486 --> 00:54:00.770
different activities associated
with birthday parties. But then

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-6
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:04.987
also it's it's quite a chaotic
scene, so starting with what we

9d3f4acd-94b1-4cde-9bc0-a606c77e4dfe-7
00:54:04.987 --> 00:54:06.459
see in the foreground.

5a298a32-0a1c-4f9d-838e-55b3418545a2-0
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.154
There is a blow up like mini
pool, the kind that you would

5a298a32-0a1c-4f9d-838e-55b3418545a2-1
00:54:13.154 --> 00:54:19.190
blow up for small children and
in there is a mermaid.

6a086201-4d0f-4b08-a7bf-c702bd383eb2-0
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.390
Who's having her head, um

9c9c0c06-b364-4b32-88cb-0f370eae21b3-0
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:27.597
Somebody is dumping a bucket of
water on her head and there's a

9c9c0c06-b364-4b32-88cb-0f370eae21b3-1
00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:31.845
couple of other kids in the pool
with her and one of them is

9c9c0c06-b364-4b32-88cb-0f370eae21b3-2
00:54:31.845 --> 00:54:36.093
filling up their Super Soaker.
One of them is standing up in

9c9c0c06-b364-4b32-88cb-0f370eae21b3-3
00:54:36.093 --> 00:54:38.740
the pool soaking other people
nearby.

ad7286c0-b1fd-4e0e-84b7-266a8ee628cf-0
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.383
There is a near the pool.
There's lots of people who are

ad7286c0-b1fd-4e0e-84b7-266a8ee628cf-1
00:54:43.383 --> 00:54:47.625
dressed up as different kinds of
characters. So it's like there's

ad7286c0-b1fd-4e0e-84b7-266a8ee628cf-2
00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:51.611
a Halloween party happening at
the same time as this birthday

ad7286c0-b1fd-4e0e-84b7-266a8ee628cf-3
00:54:51.611 --> 00:54:55.146
party. So there's there's a
ninja, there's a Princess,

ad7286c0-b1fd-4e0e-84b7-266a8ee628cf-4
00:54:55.146 --> 00:54:58.810
there's like a medieval knight
and a wizard and a witch.

0d9ca7e5-44f6-4d1f-ba24-f716d5cf1b42-0
00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:04.534
And um, lots of them are nearby
holding a hose. Um and the

0d9ca7e5-44f6-4d1f-ba24-f716d5cf1b42-1
00:55:04.534 --> 00:55:09.729
firefighter, or somebody dressed
as a firefighter is spraying

0d9ca7e5-44f6-4d1f-ba24-f716d5cf1b42-2
00:55:09.729 --> 00:55:12.160
their themselves in the face.

d8c14dbd-5fce-421c-b134-864b1d74a95f-0
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:18.472
Which is, I guess, shocking to
the football player who's

d8c14dbd-5fce-421c-b134-864b1d74a95f-1
00:55:18.472 --> 00:55:23.391
nearby. There's a table full of
gifts also in the foreground.

d8c14dbd-5fce-421c-b134-864b1d74a95f-2
00:55:23.391 --> 00:55:24.740
More to the left.

44fb28f2-5d11-407a-ad9e-8bbdd584ff6e-0
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.200
Close by, we see 2, 2 parents.

6d46ec8b-f9b7-4b3a-8973-17e31e5125ad-0
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:36.542
Or, you know, 2 adults standing
close to each other handing a

6d46ec8b-f9b7-4b3a-8973-17e31e5125ad-1
00:55:36.542 --> 00:55:41.733
large present to a child wearing
a pink dress and a bow. There's

6d46ec8b-f9b7-4b3a-8973-17e31e5125ad-2
00:55:41.733 --> 00:55:44.050
a Penguin nearby, by the way.

4bb0b58a-699a-4342-b857-2a6c48b7cfd7-0
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:50.598
There's also like a gangster and
a Mad Hatter and somebody

4bb0b58a-699a-4342-b857-2a6c48b7cfd7-1
00:55:50.598 --> 00:55:55.803
wearing like disco wear like
bell bottom pants and like the

4bb0b58a-699a-4342-b857-2a6c48b7cfd7-2
00:55:55.803 --> 00:55:58.579
Cape and like the whole 9 yards.

9c305f44-406f-40a0-897c-bfdf1eef5342-0
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.106
In the middle of the image
there's a clown holding some

9c305f44-406f-40a0-897c-bfdf1eef5342-1
00:56:04.106 --> 00:56:08.900
balloons and it's being followed
by kids that are dressed up as a

9c305f44-406f-40a0-897c-bfdf1eef5342-2
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:13.475
sheep and one that's dressed up
as a Penguin. And there's also

9c305f44-406f-40a0-897c-bfdf1eef5342-3
00:56:13.475 --> 00:56:17.905
other people dressed up nearby,
like a mummy and a fairy and

9c305f44-406f-40a0-897c-bfdf1eef5342-4
00:56:17.905 --> 00:56:20.520
another and a king and a
scarecrow.

caa5ad64-411a-4069-b911-4fa890ced6d1-0
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:26.819
To the middle, to in the middle
of the image, to the right

caa5ad64-411a-4069-b911-4fa890ced6d1-1
00:56:26.819 --> 00:56:30.608
there's kind of an island of
landscaping that's got like a

caa5ad64-411a-4069-b911-4fa890ced6d1-2
00:56:30.608 --> 00:56:33.369
tree and some hedges and some
flowers and.

8e92e9e2-ac4e-4d36-8a6d-057aa703cf36-0
00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:38.483
From there there's like lanterns
hanging from the tree and one of

8e92e9e2-ac4e-4d36-8a6d-057aa703cf36-1
00:56:38.483 --> 00:56:41.840
the children dressed as a devil
in the flower bushes.

8e68e73e-cf0a-409f-8bb4-3fb66ecf9bd0-0
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.589
And popping out and scaring an
Angel who looks like they're

8e68e73e-cf0a-409f-8bb4-3fb66ecf9bd0-1
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:50.220
falling back, holding on to
their heart.

3a6d8ff8-b6a8-4061-a3ce-09c62843b397-0
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:57.538
There's also a child or children
dressed up like a horse and near

3a6d8ff8-b6a8-4061-a3ce-09c62843b397-1
00:56:57.538 --> 00:57:02.432
there there's just all sorts of
other like costumed party

3a6d8ff8-b6a8-4061-a3ce-09c62843b397-2
00:57:02.432 --> 00:57:07.072
guests. In the background
there's a blow up Castle and

3a6d8ff8-b6a8-4061-a3ce-09c62843b397-3
00:57:07.072 --> 00:57:11.460
there's all sorts of kids in all
sorts of costumes.

26a2d276-fa3d-4d0d-a6f3-995c5fc58449-0
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:15.902
playing on the the the castle.
There's a witch who's actually

26a2d276-fa3d-4d0d-a6f3-995c5fc58449-1
00:57:15.902 --> 00:57:19.265
like sitting on the the
foreground of the castle and it

26a2d276-fa3d-4d0d-a6f3-995c5fc58449-2
00:57:19.265 --> 00:57:22.988
looks like she's removing your
shoes, which you have to do if

26a2d276-fa3d-4d0d-a6f3-995c5fc58449-3
00:57:22.988 --> 00:57:25.030
you're going on a blow up
Castle.

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-0
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.702
And then to the left, sort of
towards the back as a banquet

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-1
00:57:29.702 --> 00:57:33.195
table that's set up with all
sorts of food, and somebody's

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-2
00:57:33.195 --> 00:57:36.984
approaching with a birthday cake
that candles have already been

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-3
00:57:36.984 --> 00:57:40.714
lit and the woman behind him is
raising her hands. And some of

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-4
00:57:40.714 --> 00:57:44.503
the other kids as well, excited
to see the birthday cake making

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-5
00:57:44.503 --> 00:57:48.056
its way towards the table. But
there's like no space to put

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-6
00:57:48.056 --> 00:57:51.489
this cake because, like, the
table is already full of all

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-7
00:57:51.489 --> 00:57:55.042
sorts of other things, like
other pastries. There's another

1a675c44-b318-4d8e-a772-21741dd452df-8
00:57:55.042 --> 00:57:56.700
cake already there, in fact.

fd6e8e87-1eed-4bea-aaee-cd2091ea3fd5-0
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:01.481
A tall jello mold of stuff. Um
and ohh towards the back.

fd6e8e87-1eed-4bea-aaee-cd2091ea3fd5-1
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:06.051
There's kind of like this little
creepy area with like people

fd6e8e87-1eed-4bea-aaee-cd2091ea3fd5-2
00:58:06.051 --> 00:58:10.620
wearing death masks. This is
sort of behind the castle. Yeah,

fd6e8e87-1eed-4bea-aaee-cd2091ea3fd5-3
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:15.043
people dressed up as the grim
Reaper, one of them wearing a

fd6e8e87-1eed-4bea-aaee-cd2091ea3fd5-4
00:58:15.043 --> 00:58:16.369
skull on its head.

75813991-d485-4acf-a256-217c5c99aa38-0
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:22.467
Just kind of like creepy creepy
morbid costumes, but they all

75813991-d485-4acf-a256-217c5c99aa38-1
00:58:22.467 --> 00:58:26.900
seem to be sticking together
towards the towards the back.

d8da3a47-f9c2-48ce-8b3c-c83294908f62-0
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:32.295
So in general this is just a
birthday party which is also a

d8da3a47-f9c2-48ce-8b3c-c83294908f62-1
00:58:32.295 --> 00:58:36.135
costume party with lots of
activities going on. Oh and tug

d8da3a47-f9c2-48ce-8b3c-c83294908f62-2
00:58:36.135 --> 00:58:39.520
of war which is now solved.
#END_birthday_party_fun

f7d51996-441f-4168-a603-3090c31f6d0a-0
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.720
OK, perfect.

0d15cfbf-dd9f-4faf-aa86-7f9915e0b5ce-0
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.110
See.

38ef6140-9c0d-4b93-a673-a6fe1c6601ea-0
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.740
And next we have a short story.

1a49d3c8-5125-46e2-96ce-2666934b0d2a-0
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.930
Yeah. OK, next you have a short
story.

179ce529-5c62-48a9-9717-6d33f97b9b4e-0
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:14.854
I'm going to share my screen.
Same thing as the other short

179ce529-5c62-48a9-9717-6d33f97b9b4e-1
00:59:14.854 --> 00:59:18.890
stories. Let me know when to
move on with each slide.

40f94465-bf1e-4d46-a16d-f50d90a11071-0
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:26.150
All right.

0b34c7a6-6160-4b25-9193-6ae22ac7f115-0
00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:32.159
#START_wanderer So the story is
told in black and white

0b34c7a6-6160-4b25-9193-6ae22ac7f115-1
00:59:32.159 --> 00:59:34.630
illustrations, like pencil
drawings.

de4b22c3-53e8-455b-989e-540649ba2111-0
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:42.703
The first scene is breaking
broken down into six images, so

de4b22c3-53e8-455b-989e-540649ba2111-1
00:59:42.703 --> 00:59:47.690
we see someone who's kind of
dressed up as a.

ee898c26-47af-4fa3-823f-8c3f6512570b-0
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:49.000
Umm.

1390b788-a57b-403a-b2af-6b0234d47758-0
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:59.331
I don't know. They're dressed up
as a sort of member of a royal

1390b788-a57b-403a-b2af-6b0234d47758-1
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:04.934
family, it seems, because
they've got a lot of intricate

1390b788-a57b-403a-b2af-6b0234d47758-2
01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:11.226
and ornate pieces on their suit,
except that they're completely

1390b788-a57b-403a-b2af-6b0234d47758-3
01:00:11.226 --> 01:00:15.650
masked and it looks like the
mask has a half

90a01321-e602-4e64-8482-53a96504093c-0
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:22.255
It's like a Crescent moon coming
out of their full face mask. So,

90a01321-e602-4e64-8482-53a96504093c-1
01:00:22.255 --> 01:00:27.232
you know, so it's a creature of
the night of royalty of some

90a01321-e602-4e64-8482-53a96504093c-2
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:27.640
kind.

3f320737-8200-41a4-b84a-6309474f75ac-0
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.000
Alright, so that's one
character, and the other one

3f320737-8200-41a4-b84a-6309474f75ac-1
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.459
just seems to be a normal
person. But it's very hard to

3f320737-8200-41a4-b84a-6309474f75ac-2
01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:42.554
see their face. They're they're
dressed in slacks and a striped

3f320737-8200-41a4-b84a-6309474f75ac-3
01:00:42.554 --> 01:00:45.660
shirt and they have a blonde
full cut.

4d786010-5b45-4414-b0d7-1132be1e7a87-0
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.148
But the the face has been
obscured, so it's very hard to

4d786010-5b45-4414-b0d7-1132be1e7a87-1
01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:56.016
see what's going on with their
face. So these two characters

4d786010-5b45-4414-b0d7-1132be1e7a87-2
01:00:56.016 --> 01:01:00.804
are working together to fold an
enormous sheet of paper. So

4d786010-5b45-4414-b0d7-1132be1e7a87-3
01:01:00.804 --> 01:01:06.070
that's what's happening in these
six scenes. So in the first one,

4d786010-5b45-4414-b0d7-1132be1e7a87-4
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:06.389
the.

483c5f7d-d674-444d-8611-a2689fdf01e5-0
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:07.430
Moon.

603bc80d-74f6-44b2-845f-e4f5902087fa-0
01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:13.636
Let's call him Moon Knight,
cause why not. Moon Knight is

603bc80d-74f6-44b2-845f-e4f5902087fa-1
01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:19.095
crouched down creasing 1 edge of
the paper, while the striped

603bc80d-74f6-44b2-845f-e4f5902087fa-2
01:01:19.095 --> 01:01:20.240
shirt boy is.

36a0c4a0-5427-4bc1-844f-54f4f392a0c5-0
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.424
Laying it down on the other
side. In the next scene, moon

36a0c4a0-5427-4bc1-844f-54f4f392a0c5-1
01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:31.088
knight is in the middle of the
sheets of paper, while the

36a0c4a0-5427-4bc1-844f-54f4f392a0c5-2
01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:35.592
striped shirt guys behind
folding it over. So like moon

36a0c4a0-5427-4bc1-844f-54f4f392a0c5-3
01:01:35.592 --> 01:01:38.970
knight is, you know, meeting
both of the.

cf79ebee-a907-4192-be77-5f5e919aa7e6-0
01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.680
Triangle folds in the middle.

de317882-de2b-4465-a9cf-4ff54bfa32e9-0
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:48.321
First, they're both crouched
down on the ground, and they're

de317882-de2b-4465-a9cf-4ff54bfa32e9-1
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:52.613
folding 1 edge of the paper back
towards the point that they

de317882-de2b-4465-a9cf-4ff54bfa32e9-2
01:01:52.613 --> 01:01:56.835
created. And then in the fourth
scene they're both standing

de317882-de2b-4465-a9cf-4ff54bfa32e9-3
01:01:56.835 --> 01:02:00.845
upright holding the paper
creation between them. At this

de317882-de2b-4465-a9cf-4ff54bfa32e9-4
01:02:00.845 --> 01:02:03.730
point it kind of looks like a
paper hat.

90c74b20-23ca-434b-8237-97bb6cdd544e-0
01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.024
The opening to which is kind of
like towards the right that we

90c74b20-23ca-434b-8237-97bb6cdd544e-1
01:02:10.024 --> 01:02:14.891
can see and then from there they
are using it to sort of bend

90c74b20-23ca-434b-8237-97bb6cdd544e-2
01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:19.835
outwards some of the folds that
they created so that the final

90c74b20-23ca-434b-8237-97bb6cdd544e-3
01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:24.780
scene results in them holding up
between them a paper boat and

90c74b20-23ca-434b-8237-97bb6cdd544e-4
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:29.490
they're just kind of holding it
aloft at about waist level.

e8138be3-ff67-425c-b693-00f21e637567-0
01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.600
And then the next scene on the
the following page we see.

da38e347-837c-4b1f-a66c-29fcf77a7503-0
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:39.877
This, this giant, man, it looks
like a Spanish Armada style

da38e347-837c-4b1f-a66c-29fcf77a7503-1
01:02:39.877 --> 01:02:45.415
vessel. You know, this could be
like the Santa Maria kind of

da38e347-837c-4b1f-a66c-29fcf77a7503-2
01:02:45.415 --> 01:02:50.500
coming towards a paper boat in
the far, far background.

cc1832a3-ecc0-4418-adf9-75ba2f676efa-0
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.708
This boat, I mean, you know,
like while I'm making real life

cc1832a3-ecc0-4418-adf9-75ba2f676efa-1
01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:59.218
references is is a work of
fantasy. It looks like it's got

cc1832a3-ecc0-4418-adf9-75ba2f676efa-2
01:02:59.218 --> 01:03:00.170
a castle on its.

ddd96ac8-3301-4f82-901b-dd4984610c65-0
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.380
On the on the aft of the ship.

4c784ed4-7339-495a-94af-f1a9a5d97baa-0
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:10.783
Below, it looks as if it's like
a diver's helmet, which has

4c784ed4-7339-495a-94af-f1a9a5d97baa-1
01:03:10.783 --> 01:03:11.200
been.

d1401afc-6b09-437c-8764-ee128d7e2090-0
01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.910
Adhered to the to the.

f2722927-e919-4cb8-b50e-49a2e47626cf-0
01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:19.807
Keel of the ship upside down so
that maybe it's some kind of

f2722927-e919-4cb8-b50e-49a2e47626cf-1
01:03:19.807 --> 01:03:20.170
like.

71b8317b-6c75-4b99-b503-894ead247de2-0
01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.351
Sub submarine section of this
ship that you could go down

71b8317b-6c75-4b99-b503-894ead247de2-1
01:03:26.351 --> 01:03:31.201
there and and look underwater
and then instead of sails it's

71b8317b-6c75-4b99-b503-894ead247de2-2
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:36.210
got just like, I don't know, a
dozen or so striped wind socks.

614dafa6-74bf-4935-b649-f39368dad0af-0
01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.940
Acting as if the sail, sort of
acting in place of the sails.

084dcd58-9756-4ff1-82b5-88e320e04343-0
01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:43.850
And on the.

355fa472-e5d6-49b3-896c-3a0b2084be08-0
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:48.320
Style of the ship. There's a
really long pointed.

812783d6-0c75-4beb-9630-9809186e539c-0
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.170
Spear. It looks like a spear.

840a6947-cb4e-497c-ac32-a9ce645ce759-0
01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:57.310
And it's leaning forward like
it's it's giving the indication

840a6947-cb4e-497c-ac32-a9ce645ce759-1
01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:01.550
that it's heading towards the
paper boat in the background.

e2a784aa-9d35-4e57-86a8-2321dc366eb3-0
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:03.570
Next.

372a121c-b7f2-432a-93e7-a623572e764f-0
01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:11.402
So in this scene, which takes up
two pieces or both sheets of

372a121c-b7f2-432a-93e7-a623572e764f-1
01:04:11.402 --> 01:04:17.248
paper together, is a literally
bird's eye view of what's going

372a121c-b7f2-432a-93e7-a623572e764f-2
01:04:17.248 --> 01:04:23.001
on down below at the sea. We see
the waves indicated by these

372a121c-b7f2-432a-93e7-a623572e764f-3
01:04:23.001 --> 01:04:28.754
undulating lines of this black
and white illustration, and we

372a121c-b7f2-432a-93e7-a623572e764f-4
01:04:28.754 --> 01:04:32.930
see the paper boat down below
with a little.

4d743bbc-fc87-4da1-a064-6fff75cfb0fc-0
01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:39.550
Line marks to indicate like a
wake, as if it's moving in a

4d743bbc-fc87-4da1-a064-6fff75cfb0fc-1
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:44.867
certain direction. And from up
here we see some some seagulls,

4d743bbc-fc87-4da1-a064-6fff75cfb0fc-2
01:04:44.867 --> 01:04:47.400
so there's about a half dozen.

b0415f0c-7ee4-4d0b-b013-010a58a520fe-0
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.230
For 10 or so seagulls.

d3972527-49f4-4148-98dc-8fee560c8a97-0
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:55.608
Not sea gulls, I guess. No,
technically they're not. They

d3972527-49f4-4148-98dc-8fee560c8a97-1
01:04:55.608 --> 01:04:59.828
are sea birds of some kind that
are just flying in the same

d3972527-49f4-4148-98dc-8fee560c8a97-2
01:04:59.828 --> 01:05:02.360
direction as the as the paper
boat.

5fdc5c92-9818-4f13-8f7d-64b3a238b632-0
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:10.920
All right, so next once again we
see the boat on the water, but

5fdc5c92-9818-4f13-8f7d-64b3a238b632-1
01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.823
this time we get more of a view
from the surface of the water.

5fdc5c92-9818-4f13-8f7d-64b3a238b632-2
01:05:15.823 --> 01:05:19.170
The the boat is on the left hand
side and.

85576a45-a542-40fa-9319-2abfd4998054-0
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.880
Looking into the boat are two.

cbbfa721-4c6b-4dfa-9993-483e717dc295-0
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:27.676
Turtles that have black and
white checkered marks both on

cbbfa721-4c6b-4dfa-9993-483e717dc295-1
01:05:27.676 --> 01:05:29.860
their skin and on their shells.

f054b4b5-979c-4a2a-8506-8720ad887c69-0
01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.935
That the checker marks on their
skin is very like small, whereas

f054b4b5-979c-4a2a-8506-8720ad887c69-1
01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:40.140
the checker remarks on their
shells are are larger.

904682ac-71bb-4cbd-9e35-ab1c36687bb6-0
01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:45.337
We see the birds still up in the
sky in this scene. It just looks

904682ac-71bb-4cbd-9e35-ab1c36687bb6-1
01:05:45.337 --> 01:05:48.860
like the turtles want to like
look inside of the boat.

b73f7222-9971-4ceb-94fe-935ba0e83da1-0
01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:52.592
There's two turtles looking in
the boat, and then there's

b73f7222-9971-4ceb-94fe-935ba0e83da1-1
01:05:52.592 --> 01:05:55.659
another turtle in the foreground
and it's just kind of blowing

b73f7222-9971-4ceb-94fe-935ba0e83da1-2
01:05:55.659 --> 01:05:56.730
water out of its nose.

100a99ff-1380-49aa-839e-13e74a2ad8de-0
01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.810
And then on the right is a giant
sunfish. Oh, it's a different

100a99ff-1380-49aa-839e-13e74a2ad8de-1
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:06.111
scene because the boat is still
there. OK, alright. So in the

100a99ff-1380-49aa-839e-13e74a2ad8de-2
01:06:06.111 --> 01:06:09.996
next scene we see a giant
sunfish kind of coming out of

100a99ff-1380-49aa-839e-13e74a2ad8de-3
01:06:09.996 --> 01:06:14.228
the water and looking at the
boat. All of these creatures so

100a99ff-1380-49aa-839e-13e74a2ad8de-4
01:06:14.228 --> 01:06:15.129
far have had.

bec80542-ba41-4ede-81d6-cf3fe7719566-0
01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.650
Vacant glowing white eyes.

dbdf0964-f716-40f4-924b-264d4e731715-0
01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:23.369
So this one is no different and
it's just kind of looking at the

dbdf0964-f716-40f4-924b-264d4e731715-1
01:06:23.369 --> 01:06:26.990
boat and it's pretty ominous
because this is a giant fish.

506b37eb-71d1-41f0-8cdd-d311e0583367-0
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:29.540
But so far the boat seems.

15512735-e3ff-42ce-9384-c3ed96981bd9-0
01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.120
Unscathed.

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-0
01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:42.030
All right, So what I thought
were bubbles coming up around

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-1
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:46.630
the sunfish just seems to be the
pattern of the sunfish because

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-2
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:50.942
now it's underwater and it's
it's hoisted the paper boat up

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-3
01:06:50.942 --> 01:06:54.823
on its dorsal fin and it's just
kind of like swimming

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-4
01:06:54.823 --> 01:06:59.351
underwater. But now we can see
that the the sunfish itself is,

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-5
01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:04.094
this is just what it looks like.
So it's not just black, it's got

a35cef2e-ad22-4206-9bc2-8a3fb5260029-6
01:07:04.094 --> 01:07:07.759
white spots all over it and the
underside is also.

ccf1763d-264d-4587-b708-12b931e9ea27-0
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:11.868
bright white. We also see a
swordfish in the foreground

ccf1763d-264d-4587-b708-12b931e9ea27-1
01:07:11.868 --> 01:07:15.350
that's kind of swimming through
a school of fish.

6793ac9f-eeec-47a8-ba69-d969dcb8e166-0
01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:20.024
There's actually schools
efficient everywhere in this

6793ac9f-eeec-47a8-ba69-d969dcb8e166-1
01:07:20.024 --> 01:07:24.077
scene, just kind of like making
patterns with the way that the

6793ac9f-eeec-47a8-ba69-d969dcb8e166-2
01:07:24.077 --> 01:07:25.300
fish were swimming.

d4bd65c9-08bd-4f03-b64f-d40833c5452c-0
01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.105
Yeah, there's probably about 5
or so different kinds of fish in

d4bd65c9-08bd-4f03-b64f-d40833c5452c-1
01:07:31.105 --> 01:07:34.300
this scene, apart from the
sunfish and the swordfish.

fc9d55f4-139c-460d-8dbe-f7e286babe28-0
01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:39.896
Or is it a Marlin? I don't know.
It's either a swordfish or

fc9d55f4-139c-460d-8dbe-f7e286babe28-1
01:07:39.896 --> 01:07:40.320
Marlin.

6f347883-ec4d-41d6-a608-67a5bc384ed4-0
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:46.314
In addition, there's some coral
happening on the right hand

6f347883-ec4d-41d6-a608-67a5bc384ed4-1
01:07:46.314 --> 01:07:51.086
side, so the coral reef kind of
extends above the surface of the

6f347883-ec4d-41d6-a608-67a5bc384ed4-2
01:07:51.086 --> 01:07:55.344
water just just a bit. Although
upon closer inspection it

6f347883-ec4d-41d6-a608-67a5bc384ed4-3
01:07:55.344 --> 01:08:00.042
actually might not be coral, it
might just also be comprised of

6f347883-ec4d-41d6-a608-67a5bc384ed4-4
01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:00.410
fish.

20a82199-53ec-4ba2-8d85-8dc91518fde1-0
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.736
So I think that that would
require just more detail than my

20a82199-53ec-4ba2-8d85-8dc91518fde1-1
01:08:05.736 --> 01:08:09.761
screen would provide. In the
bottom right hand corner there's

20a82199-53ec-4ba2-8d85-8dc91518fde1-2
01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:13.787
also tentacled creatures, so
like there's an octopus, kind of

20a82199-53ec-4ba2-8d85-8dc91518fde1-3
01:08:13.787 --> 01:08:17.813
like hiding amongst the coral,
which also might not be coral,

20a82199-53ec-4ba2-8d85-8dc91518fde1-4
01:08:17.813 --> 01:08:21.320
but might just be cleverly
disguised schools of fish.

0c47a93e-90fb-4b85-838c-ef0b6fdae40c-0
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.922
All right, so once again there's
a lot more coral happening. And

0c47a93e-90fb-4b85-838c-ef0b6fdae40c-1
01:08:28.922 --> 01:08:32.678
yes, it is actually made of
fish. So in instead of there

0c47a93e-90fb-4b85-838c-ef0b6fdae40c-2
01:08:32.678 --> 01:08:36.829
being a proper coral reef, what
I thought was coral was just a

0c47a93e-90fb-4b85-838c-ef0b6fdae40c-3
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:41.112
bunch of fish crammed together.
The paper boat now just seems to

0c47a93e-90fb-4b85-838c-ef0b6fdae40c-4
01:08:41.112 --> 01:08:41.310
be.

03663128-0fa5-4a6e-9ea2-5850dddb0ace-0
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:47.825
Seems to have come ashore onto
the part of this coral reef,

03663128-0fa5-4a6e-9ea2-5850dddb0ace-1
01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:50.920
which is actually just like the
backs of several fish.

5edb5d98-2fa3-4105-9a03-0c2e2f3bda27-0
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:56.197
And in the rest of this scene,
there's just like more coral and

5edb5d98-2fa3-4105-9a03-0c2e2f3bda27-1
01:08:56.197 --> 01:08:58.160
more fish and more coral fish.

a8443754-30b4-4c27-bc42-8e6d19e538b2-0
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:05.984
Once again, there's like maybe a
dozen or so different kinds of

a8443754-30b4-4c27-bc42-8e6d19e538b2-1
01:09:05.984 --> 01:09:11.803
fish and different fanning and
tunnel versions of the of the

a8443754-30b4-4c27-bc42-8e6d19e538b2-2
01:09:11.803 --> 01:09:13.329
coral reef here.

8289d502-5e04-422b-ada1-6d0028f289bb-0
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:20.460
Alright, so in.

7e01494a-902c-4cf6-a2cd-6d96c81b6c92-0
01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:23.880
In the first scene we see the
paper boat.

34b6375b-65d8-4d39-9611-4c12ff6c494f-0
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:29.729
Floating on the surface of the
water and attached to it is some

34b6375b-65d8-4d39-9611-4c12ff6c494f-1
01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:33.060
kind of like a creature like a a
cuttlefish maybe?

41e2b563-b756-4fed-8769-3b86537b8834-0
01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.544
Seems to have clamped on there
and the there's like maybe four

41e2b563-b756-4fed-8769-3b86537b8834-1
01:09:39.544 --> 01:09:44.744
other cuttlefish nearby that are
looking again with the white

41e2b563-b756-4fed-8769-3b86537b8834-2
01:09:44.744 --> 01:09:49.944
vacant eyes up at the paper bow
and the clutching cuttlefish,

41e2b563-b756-4fed-8769-3b86537b8834-3
01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:55.229
just kind of like with interest.
In the foreground we see more

41e2b563-b756-4fed-8769-3b86537b8834-4
01:09:55.229 --> 01:10:00.010
fish and more coral, and we see
these two fish who have.

feb05460-a118-46ad-bbb0-cb944d75b73f-0
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.516
Fish heads, and then their
anthropomorphized bodies. So

feb05460-a118-46ad-bbb0-cb944d75b73f-1
01:10:05.516 --> 01:10:09.737
it's like they look like
angelfish, I think, you know,

feb05460-a118-46ad-bbb0-cb944d75b73f-2
01:10:09.737 --> 01:10:13.190
from, like the neck up, and
they're kissing.

beb63f4a-2d2f-4107-8c57-2f71d1b54b86-0
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:17.031
There's a kind of a kissing
fish. I'm wondering if that's

beb63f4a-2d2f-4107-8c57-2f71d1b54b86-1
01:10:17.031 --> 01:10:17.980
what they're meant to be.

e0fa2bd2-5023-4b3e-a068-e6acdfe05dcc-0
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:22.775
But then the rest of their
bodies look humanoid, so they

e0fa2bd2-5023-4b3e-a068-e6acdfe05dcc-1
01:10:22.775 --> 01:10:27.003
have arms and they have torsos,
and it's hard to see their legs

e0fa2bd2-5023-4b3e-a068-e6acdfe05dcc-2
01:10:27.003 --> 01:10:30.240
because, like, they're standing,
maybe standing.

1ae53a05-859c-4bae-86c4-0a03165467e7-0
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.270
Behind a piece of coral.

5ac58d71-5ef8-41fd-978b-10e918895385-0
01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:39.300
And then in our next scene, the
cuttlefish are gone. There's a

5ac58d71-5ef8-41fd-978b-10e918895385-1
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:44.456
fishing pole hanging out from
the side of the paper boat, and

5ac58d71-5ef8-41fd-978b-10e918895385-2
01:10:44.456 --> 01:10:49.613
it seems to have caught a fish
and the fish population that's

5ac58d71-5ef8-41fd-978b-10e918895385-3
01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.609
around during this scene

2eedd541-d25a-4778-882f-cc882517839c-0
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.630
Look concerned. So once again
there's another like.

8b2c3c3b-2e65-47ec-871d-3c7829772384-0
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.520
Um.

7a6312b2-6475-4a91-b18a-83016729b6e0-0
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:03.000
What was the word I used before?

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-0
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:08.426
Anthropomorphized fish, that's
like doing some gardening or

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-1
01:11:08.426 --> 01:11:12.329
something. He's holding a pair
of scissors and he has a finger

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-2
01:11:12.329 --> 01:11:16.046
on his chin and his mouth is
open. Looking at the fish that

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-3
01:11:16.046 --> 01:11:19.825
was just caught by the fishing
pole coming out of the of the

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-4
01:11:19.825 --> 01:11:23.728
paper boat and, you know, kind
of looking on with concern. The

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-5
01:11:23.728 --> 01:11:27.507
other fish that are in the area,
all with their like, gazing

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-6
01:11:27.507 --> 01:11:31.286
white eyes, are looking also at
this fish that had just been

f80b9e17-f613-4865-bb43-f97b43373618-7
01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:31.720
caught.

85b504af-262d-4780-b93c-60822325e618-0
01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:36.574
And so this this definitely does
not seem normal. Like no one had

85b504af-262d-4780-b93c-60822325e618-1
01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:39.400
paid attention really to the
paper boat before.

973aa874-55f7-4bb6-9f42-25f388f4dd23-0
01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:44.716
Before this scene. Well, I mean
they they did, but not not with

973aa874-55f7-4bb6-9f42-25f388f4dd23-1
01:11:44.716 --> 01:11:46.100
this level of concern.

1a832b16-74b0-4da9-b4cd-794628cb6314-0
01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.010
So now the fish.

c0e3de94-2e5b-4af0-ac11-e156eb083366-0
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:55.170
Are.

23f3a368-a651-480e-99b7-b0980847e453-0
01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.580
Investigating the boat with.

8fc089cd-d07c-4e18-b076-7c446d335936-0
01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.810
All right, well, the boat is
still afloat.

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-0
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.919
On the on the surface of the
water, on top of one of the

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-1
01:12:08.919 --> 01:12:13.128
coral structures, which looks
like coral and actually not a

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-2
01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:17.619
ton of fish working together, is
is a large fish, fish and it's

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-3
01:12:17.619 --> 01:12:22.179
got a seahorse on top of it. And
the seahorse is wearing a paper

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-4
01:12:22.179 --> 01:12:25.898
hat. And the two of them
together are looking at the

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-5
01:12:25.898 --> 01:12:29.897
paper boat. And below them,
below the coral are a lot of

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-6
01:12:29.897 --> 01:12:34.037
other fish. Some of them are
just kind of swimming around,

3f463463-007a-4935-acd7-889a6743439a-7
01:12:34.037 --> 01:12:35.230
some of them are.

0cd940b9-f080-4a56-951a-b508ade42756-0
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:40.048
Looking up at this like
investigation that's taking

0cd940b9-f080-4a56-951a-b508ade42756-1
01:12:40.048 --> 01:12:45.790
place at the top of the coral.
In the next scene, we see a lot

0cd940b9-f080-4a56-951a-b508ade42756-2
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:51.440
of Stingrays or manta rays on
the scene and there are there's

0cd940b9-f080-4a56-951a-b508ade42756-3
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.000
like a sea snake or an eel that
has come up from the seabed.

683d89e9-46fc-48ae-8bc6-00bf7e8338ba-0
01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.776
Ohh yeah. So like yeah, they're
sand worms. OK, so they're sea

683d89e9-46fc-48ae-8bc6-00bf7e8338ba-1
01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:01.060
worms.

38762136-92d1-4df5-95ef-592de197de78-0
01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.600
Or sea snakes.

0a23da1f-c44a-4c92-b906-e4ecbfad8f00-0
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:06.417
They usually live below the
surface of the sand, but

0a23da1f-c44a-4c92-b906-e4ecbfad8f00-1
01:13:06.417 --> 01:13:09.250
sometimes they pop their heads
up so there are.

64038344-c794-4488-a9d5-5a8ac2da9b72-0
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.800
Hundreds of them, as implied by
the scene and one of them.

cd865a39-9773-40ec-9d6b-fe1afd60264f-0
01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:20.354
Has extended its whole body and
has come all the way up to the

cd865a39-9773-40ec-9d6b-fe1afd60264f-1
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:24.429
surface and has popped its head
into the paper boat. The

cd865a39-9773-40ec-9d6b-fe1afd60264f-2
01:13:24.429 --> 01:13:29.148
seahorse from before wearing the
paper bat hat is now in the boat

cd865a39-9773-40ec-9d6b-fe1afd60264f-3
01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:33.581
and it's I think at the bow of
the boat, kind of like looking

cd865a39-9773-40ec-9d6b-fe1afd60264f-4
01:13:33.581 --> 01:13:34.010
ahead.

a3f86d69-b38e-4fdb-a04a-8779b08ae3ba-0
01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.115
In this next scene, the paper
boat, which is still afloat on

a3f86d69-b38e-4fdb-a04a-8779b08ae3ba-1
01:13:43.115 --> 01:13:48.510
the surface of the water, is
coming up to a Grove of plants.

b30db2dc-fd16-4f41-ba88-dece795a2fee-0
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:50.910
These like they've.

77c503f5-77ca-44d7-89b9-4d9fb0b1141d-0
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:52.740
They've got like.

5786c1f2-947c-425a-a16f-10831ccf42fc-0
01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:57.900
The kinds of roots you would
expect from plants that grow.

86780a89-1feb-46f1-8f27-c780bbce31f0-0
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.790
Around um.

01bef20d-eed4-4634-8524-8f757c3c2e8c-0
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:06.083
You know like wetland areas the
the roots kind of like extend

01bef20d-eed4-4634-8524-8f757c3c2e8c-1
01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:10.576
far out from the base of the
plant and and kind of like reach

01bef20d-eed4-4634-8524-8f757c3c2e8c-2
01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:13.040
down into the water kind of
like.

bdb763e9-4207-4166-a431-62837a12e61b-0
01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.920
Trees and other plants in the
Everglades.

64d2212a-79bc-49b3-8722-c6f33216c795-0
01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:21.730
And the plants extend um.

3f9374a6-485e-4df9-a2c3-e396d66c9e69-0
01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:26.423
Up through to the top of the
page, I mean, so these plants

3f9374a6-485e-4df9-a2c3-e396d66c9e69-1
01:14:26.423 --> 01:14:30.452
are quite tall and amongst the
plants are about three dozen or

3f9374a6-485e-4df9-a2c3-e396d66c9e69-2
01:14:30.452 --> 01:14:34.353
so birds with white birds with
very long necks. It's hard to

3f9374a6-485e-4df9-a2c3-e396d66c9e69-3
01:14:34.353 --> 01:14:38.382
say exactly what kind of birds
they are, but they kind of look

3f9374a6-485e-4df9-a2c3-e396d66c9e69-4
01:14:38.382 --> 01:14:39.150
like cranes.

062d0193-cb7d-44c8-8ea5-d7906b9ba849-0
01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:48.769
So next we've got the plant or
the the boat moving through the

062d0193-cb7d-44c8-8ea5-d7906b9ba849-1
01:14:48.769 --> 01:14:53.367
plants. So it's on the surface
of the water kind of moving

062d0193-cb7d-44c8-8ea5-d7906b9ba849-2
01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:54.770
amongst the roots.

c9d89e33-4fe0-408f-8296-224aa89dca06-0
01:14:55.910 --> 01:15:01.250
And it's kind of like making its
way through, um, the the boat is

c9d89e33-4fe0-408f-8296-224aa89dca06-1
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:06.023
passing behind one of these
plants and is about to pass in

c9d89e33-4fe0-408f-8296-224aa89dca06-2
01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:08.370
front of one of these others.

3957f7b3-d00a-43db-9216-d4b64ca638df-0
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:12.989
And um, oh, it's moving to the
right, so I guess it's already

3957f7b3-d00a-43db-9216-d4b64ca638df-1
01:15:12.989 --> 01:15:14.650
passed in front of it, so.

ebf56d5c-5a4f-4f79-8bcb-dcf6f6b77785-0
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:19.964
We have a sort of a closer view
of some of the plant life that's

ebf56d5c-5a4f-4f79-8bcb-dcf6f6b77785-1
01:15:19.964 --> 01:15:24.350
here. Below the surface of the
water, there's a lot, lots of

ebf56d5c-5a4f-4f79-8bcb-dcf6f6b77785-2
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:28.881
smaller fish swimming around.
The birds are in amongst the the

ebf56d5c-5a4f-4f79-8bcb-dcf6f6b77785-3
01:15:28.881 --> 01:15:33.339
branches and the leaves and, you
know, seem to be interacting

ebf56d5c-5a4f-4f79-8bcb-dcf6f6b77785-4
01:15:33.339 --> 01:15:34.490
with each other.

b38e4bd9-44cd-452a-bace-d4066d5a544d-0
01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:40.397
And once again, the fish from
down below all have these like

b38e4bd9-44cd-452a-bace-d4066d5a544d-1
01:15:40.397 --> 01:15:41.920
white vacant eyes.

0dbe3fa0-d528-48fc-80c6-e34addab3573-0
01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:52.772
OK, so this time the boat is
really deep in into this like

0dbe3fa0-d528-48fc-80c6-e34addab3573-1
01:15:52.772 --> 01:15:58.493
this Grove of plants and the
scene that's happening is a bit

0dbe3fa0-d528-48fc-80c6-e34addab3573-2
01:15:58.493 --> 01:16:03.744
more sinister. So we have, we
have these like reptilian

0dbe3fa0-d528-48fc-80c6-e34addab3573-3
01:16:03.744 --> 01:16:09.558
creatures that are up in the the
trees themselves or possibly

0dbe3fa0-d528-48fc-80c6-e34addab3573-4
01:16:09.558 --> 01:16:15.091
they they make up some of the
trees just like how the fish

0dbe3fa0-d528-48fc-80c6-e34addab3573-5
01:16:15.091 --> 01:16:17.530
made up some of the coral.

5ce089f9-41a1-44c7-a74e-294fc2eeedb3-0
01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:18.820
Um, the.

e3026b96-6fe8-4b97-b592-8cd2d899311b-0
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.240
Umm.

066c9d73-d1c7-4fef-8049-581dfa6f582a-0
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.968
As the boat continues to kind of
move through this area, we see

066c9d73-d1c7-4fef-8049-581dfa6f582a-1
01:16:27.968 --> 01:16:32.607
the the seahorse with the paper
hat and it was still still there

066c9d73-d1c7-4fef-8049-581dfa6f582a-2
01:16:32.607 --> 01:16:36.747
and everyone kind of like
sinisterly looking on from from

066c9d73-d1c7-4fef-8049-581dfa6f582a-3
01:16:36.747 --> 01:16:37.390
up above.

73fdc3ea-f29d-46bb-ae5b-c80067156183-0
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.913
There's also like a small bird
that's perched like in the

73fdc3ea-f29d-46bb-ae5b-c80067156183-1
01:16:42.913 --> 01:16:47.491
middle of this scene, just kind
of looking up at the reptile

73fdc3ea-f29d-46bb-ae5b-c80067156183-2
01:16:47.491 --> 01:16:52.144
heads and then in the foreground
but but in the dark, so it's

73fdc3ea-f29d-46bb-ae5b-c80067156183-3
01:16:52.144 --> 01:16:56.722
almost silhouetted by the scene
are quite a few other birds,

73fdc3ea-f29d-46bb-ae5b-c80067156183-4
01:16:56.722 --> 01:16:59.799
Sparrow like birds, all with
white eyes.

219c62d7-28fd-4884-a252-c69d66a4f79d-0
01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.230
And a couple of crabs down
below.

60277bf9-4a87-417a-8608-d025e6719ad0-0
01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:13.485
So in this next scene, the paper
boat has like started to make

60277bf9-4a87-417a-8608-d025e6719ad0-1
01:17:13.485 --> 01:17:18.356
its way out of this area. The
seahorse is looking down like

60277bf9-4a87-417a-8608-d025e6719ad0-2
01:17:18.356 --> 01:17:20.630
it's brighter, there's like.

1a8d1415-d53e-418e-a1c9-e870517f8fdd-0
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:24.700
There's more white like, you
know.

f269f898-2d3a-4ab2-8bc4-d17206aad793-0
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:29.916
White light, I guess. So we know
that we're moving out of like

f269f898-2d3a-4ab2-8bc4-d17206aad793-1
01:17:29.916 --> 01:17:33.808
the dark mangrove area from
before. The seahorse looks down

f269f898-2d3a-4ab2-8bc4-d17206aad793-2
01:17:33.808 --> 01:17:35.560
into the water and it sees.

b608c005-91a9-4df8-a7ff-5e55d625def7-0
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.575
A sea creature, like a kind of a
sea slug looking

b608c005-91a9-4df8-a7ff-5e55d625def7-1
01:17:40.575 --> 01:17:44.770
anthropomorphized creature
that's on the back of a lobster.

bf65275b-100b-4ab0-aa45-f3f1184e78bc-0
01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:50.450
Just making its way across this
this seabed, the sea floor.

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-0
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:56.615
And then in the following scene,
the the seahorse jumps out of

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-1
01:17:56.615 --> 01:18:01.264
the paper boat and is sort of
halfway between the boat and

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-2
01:18:01.264 --> 01:18:06.072
falling into the water. And
below that, under the surface of

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-3
01:18:06.072 --> 01:18:10.958
the water, are at least three
other sea horse creatures which

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-4
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:15.529
look just like it. And its a
paper hat flies off, so it's

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-5
01:18:15.529 --> 01:18:20.336
like it just found its family,
and below that are additional

5c9a4315-ed77-424c-945b-056ce9c086cf-6
01:18:20.336 --> 01:18:21.440
sea creatures.

7df1bdd2-91a3-456d-a068-742bfc81c72b-0
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.755
More eel or possibly an electric
eel or down below and some other

7df1bdd2-91a3-456d-a068-742bfc81c72b-1
01:18:26.755 --> 01:18:31.314
angelfish are there and the the
boat, the paper boat continues

7df1bdd2-91a3-456d-a068-742bfc81c72b-2
01:18:31.314 --> 01:18:32.110
to move on.

b5935bd7-569a-4030-ad2a-dcc5359b1ab3-0
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:42.718
All right, so in this scene,
it's like the full body look at

b5935bd7-569a-4030-ad2a-dcc5359b1ab3-1
01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:48.916
a whale. Can't say what kind of
whale. It's like a fantasy

b5935bd7-569a-4030-ad2a-dcc5359b1ab3-2
01:18:48.916 --> 01:18:54.380
whale, and it's smoking a pipe
out of its blowhole.

b903d88a-de67-4a4a-83f5-14e06d914b04-0
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:59.306
The paper boat is sailing on
right past the whale, so the

b903d88a-de67-4a4a-83f5-14e06d914b04-1
01:18:59.306 --> 01:19:03.344
surface of the water is about
one 10th of the way down on this

b903d88a-de67-4a4a-83f5-14e06d914b04-2
01:19:03.344 --> 01:19:07.253
page. The rest of it is just
whale, it's just whales all the

b903d88a-de67-4a4a-83f5-14e06d914b04-3
01:19:07.253 --> 01:19:07.829
way down.

cde8019e-6bcd-4c73-baf0-9656e0ea92f7-0
01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:10.650
Some fish are coming up from.

61fa2b30-948c-4ed3-8e61-96bc95697233-0
01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.557
From like the background area.
So mostly we just kind of see

61fa2b30-948c-4ed3-8e61-96bc95697233-1
01:19:15.557 --> 01:19:18.330
this whale hanging out and
smoking its pipe.

c6ddea06-c4ac-4ba0-b651-aa8180d2180c-0
01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:23.590
In the next scene, this is very
much like a fantasy creature.

100f2898-ae5e-445d-9f4d-794d0cf13811-0
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.595
It has. It's like one of those
like nightmare fish. What are

100f2898-ae5e-445d-9f4d-794d0cf13811-1
01:19:29.595 --> 01:19:33.000
those called? Angler fishes, an
angler fish?

ec4c1139-db6f-448b-8c8f-84445316ba36-0
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:36.140
That has the.

18c00578-67c8-4c3d-bb86-adb4a421f20a-0
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.590
Sort of.

238dadbd-65d1-413c-8018-71ea0b7efc54-0
01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:45.358
Antenna that's coming out from
the middle of its forehead and

238dadbd-65d1-413c-8018-71ea0b7efc54-1
01:19:45.358 --> 01:19:50.517
it has some bioluminescent light
that lights up in, you know,

238dadbd-65d1-413c-8018-71ea0b7efc54-2
01:19:50.517 --> 01:19:53.430
deep sea areas, and that's how
it.

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-0
01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:58.585
You know, attracts prey, except
that this creature is on an

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-1
01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:03.369
enormous scale, and it's not in
the deep sea. It's very much at

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-2
01:20:03.369 --> 01:20:07.929
the surface of the water, and it
is looking over towards the

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-3
01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:12.788
paper boat, and it's shining its
light from like the the antenna

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-4
01:20:12.788 --> 01:20:17.647
that it's got, except that it's
not like a bioluminescent light.

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-5
01:20:17.647 --> 01:20:22.581
It is just a Lantern or a box of
light, you know, it almost looks

a7c6c98b-808a-484a-96ff-ff944cf6425e-6
01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:24.450
electronic. The creature.

dc76b2eb-6852-4bee-b47d-2c4e0ba7a120-0
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:25.320
has

b7dd9686-3c81-41c1-bc3a-a27421d410e9-0
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:31.989
Very confusingly, it's got like
crab claws and it's got like

b7dd9686-3c81-41c1-bc3a-a27421d410e9-1
01:20:31.989 --> 01:20:38.199
about 12 or so tentacles coming
out of its tail area, and it is

b7dd9686-3c81-41c1-bc3a-a27421d410e9-2
01:20:38.199 --> 01:20:40.820
standing on what look like.

775bfaa3-7fc7-4bc2-bbe5-12febda884db-0
01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:48.643
Like crab legs on top of just
maybe a dozen or so different

775bfaa3-7fc7-4bc2-bbe5-12febda884db-1
01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:54.458
shipwrecks. So all of these
ships are down below, and this

775bfaa3-7fc7-4bc2-bbe5-12febda884db-2
01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:56.430
creature seems like.

826882e5-7cf7-4ff6-a0e2-c8781d3ae7ed-0
01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:02.245
Its goal is to lure ships to it
and then wreck them and add them

826882e5-7cf7-4ff6-a0e2-c8781d3ae7ed-1
01:21:02.245 --> 01:21:07.210
to its collection. And if we're
looking at all of the ships down

826882e5-7cf7-4ff6-a0e2-c8781d3ae7ed-2
01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:11.869
at its feet, you know, they're
very sort of traditional, you

826882e5-7cf7-4ff6-a0e2-c8781d3ae7ed-3
01:21:11.869 --> 01:21:16.452
know, steamships, except that
there's one paper boat that's

826882e5-7cf7-4ff6-a0e2-c8781d3ae7ed-4
01:21:16.452 --> 01:21:19.890
also amongst the wreckage that's
down there.

2eeaf344-dcf0-4ed4-b4d9-ef14ff6d536c-0
01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:28.214
And in this final scene, the
paper boat is still floating,

2eeaf344-dcf0-4ed4-b4d9-ef14ff6d536c-1
01:21:28.214 --> 01:21:32.608
but this time it's surrounded by
all sorts of creatures and we

2eeaf344-dcf0-4ed4-b4d9-ef14ff6d536c-2
01:21:32.608 --> 01:21:36.653
see it kind of sailing into the
moonlight or no, no, it's

2eeaf344-dcf0-4ed4-b4d9-ef14ff6d536c-3
01:21:36.653 --> 01:21:40.977
sailing into the sunset and the
moon has also risen and is on

2eeaf344-dcf0-4ed4-b4d9-ef14ff6d536c-4
01:21:40.977 --> 01:21:43.140
the right hand side of the sky.

84342c37-b97a-40fa-96d7-75d8ec6c92df-0
01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:49.824
At the surface of the water are
all of these creatures, and it

84342c37-b97a-40fa-96d7-75d8ec6c92df-1
01:21:49.824 --> 01:21:54.601
doesn't really make sense that
any of them are here. They're

84342c37-b97a-40fa-96d7-75d8ec6c92df-2
01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:59.692
they're mostly fantasy versions
of real animals, like alligators

84342c37-b97a-40fa-96d7-75d8ec6c92df-3
01:21:59.692 --> 01:22:01.650
and zebras and a cheetah.

baabbd00-5cd6-438e-ae15-b88bad7db639-0
01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.360
Elephants, um.

15325bea-32d5-4d8b-9507-697abbf14ad1-0
01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:09.001
But they're all like marine
versions of them. It's almost

15325bea-32d5-4d8b-9507-697abbf14ad1-1
01:22:09.001 --> 01:22:12.348
like they're all like mermaid
mermaid version. It's like a

15325bea-32d5-4d8b-9507-697abbf14ad1-2
01:22:12.348 --> 01:22:15.640
mermaid version of a zebra or a
mermaid version of a dog.

ed987370-3e81-4815-a28d-ff74e053e6f1-0
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:21.973
But with like fins for feet. So
it's not even like they're

ed987370-3e81-4815-a28d-ff74e053e6f1-1
01:22:21.973 --> 01:22:27.000
really effective at being marine
versions of themselves.

ad30ecb8-0e66-441c-8973-f3abce428042-0
01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:33.497
And a cat is jumping into the
paper boat. The cat, just like

ad30ecb8-0e66-441c-8973-f3abce428042-1
01:22:33.497 --> 01:22:38.804
all the other creatures, has um
flippers instead of hands or

ad30ecb8-0e66-441c-8973-f3abce428042-2
01:22:38.804 --> 01:22:39.240
feet.

2e4d7157-375a-4494-9166-5bc7e1a38ab0-0
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:44.154
And a dorsal fin, but still has
its tail and still has its

2e4d7157-375a-4494-9166-5bc7e1a38ab0-1
01:22:44.154 --> 01:22:47.080
little cat face and still has
its little cat ears.

cbb954f8-3da0-4a06-9f5e-5b31c810c218-0
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:48.350
Umm.

e22c814d-e0a0-45cf-a4b8-08af03772716-0
01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:53.589
So yeah, they're all, they're
kind of just all in this scene,

e22c814d-e0a0-45cf-a4b8-08af03772716-1
01:22:53.589 --> 01:22:57.917
all hanging out. There's some
some flying creatures as well,

e22c814d-e0a0-45cf-a4b8-08af03772716-2
01:22:57.917 --> 01:23:01.820
but even those flying creatures
have dorsal fins like.

8fb9b6ad-4d06-49ee-ad9e-39a9f00ebe1a-0
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:07.670
Yeah, dorsal fins, I wanna say,
instead of proper tails.

af4ae62f-43ee-41f4-9730-5c1567f4b339-0
01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:17.832
So this is a nighttime scene
that has the starry sky and we

af4ae62f-43ee-41f4-9730-5c1567f4b339-1
01:23:17.832 --> 01:23:21.990
can kind of milk make out the
Milky Way a little bit. The

af4ae62f-43ee-41f4-9730-5c1567f4b339-2
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:26.364
Crescent Moon is to the right
that has a sort of Halo around

af4ae62f-43ee-41f4-9730-5c1567f4b339-3
01:23:26.364 --> 01:23:26.580
it.

79025685-1e45-4e76-ac91-6c855df6effe-0
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:32.230
And the paper boat is afloat on
the water, and below it are all

79025685-1e45-4e76-ac91-6c855df6effe-1
01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:36.730
of these creatures, probably
fish. They're marine creatures

79025685-1e45-4e76-ac91-6c855df6effe-2
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:41.155
of some kind, and their eyes
glow. So you get a sense that

79025685-1e45-4e76-ac91-6c855df6effe-3
01:23:41.155 --> 01:23:45.880
there are probably about 100 or
so of these creatures that are

79025685-1e45-4e76-ac91-6c855df6effe-4
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:49.630
just swarming underneath where
the paper boat is.

2507dcc2-ab16-48a9-869e-5555f22207a3-0
01:23:55.310 --> 01:24:01.840
And in this scene we see the
hundreds of fish that had been.

0404f066-28c5-4c4d-8ea6-d8c2142dab90-0
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:07.588
Swarming below the paper boat
now at the surface of the water,

0404f066-28c5-4c4d-8ea6-d8c2142dab90-1
01:24:07.588 --> 01:24:12.756
and all of them circled around
looking at the paper boat, which

0404f066-28c5-4c4d-8ea6-d8c2142dab90-2
01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:17.683
has no place to go because it is
completely encircled by and

0404f066-28c5-4c4d-8ea6-d8c2142dab90-3
01:24:17.683 --> 01:24:22.610
trapped by all of these fish.
The fish themselves are about.

1d749240-c9c6-4b45-a0c5-951b65c5084c-0
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:29.485
Halfway out of the water, like
their heads, their gills, their

1d749240-c9c6-4b45-a0c5-951b65c5084c-1
01:24:29.485 --> 01:24:32.140
fins are all out of the water.

074145bb-59ff-4ea2-bdce-3289a5ed43cf-0
01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.360
And surrounding the paper boat.

92cfd41b-b127-4317-8c24-521f7aa59edb-0
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:44.209
The scene is still a nighttime
scene of the paper boat floating

92cfd41b-b127-4317-8c24-521f7aa59edb-1
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:46.430
across the ocean has all of the
fish.

3b09243e-6f9e-470d-8c92-1b17b992e19b-0
01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:52.883
Swimming away, we only see about
four fish and um, you know, we

3b09243e-6f9e-470d-8c92-1b17b992e19b-1
01:24:52.883 --> 01:24:57.517
see their their back fins kind
of like up out of the water as

3b09243e-6f9e-470d-8c92-1b17b992e19b-2
01:24:57.517 --> 01:25:02.226
if they've just swam away and
the Aurora borealis is up in the

3b09243e-6f9e-470d-8c92-1b17b992e19b-3
01:25:02.226 --> 01:25:04.020
sky making all sorts of.

deb1db24-7e0c-4988-9e95-2c5fbfd4d41a-0
01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:10.499
Amazing looking, awe inspiring
waves of light across what would

deb1db24-7e0c-4988-9e95-2c5fbfd4d41a-1
01:25:10.499 --> 01:25:14.570
have otherwise been a pitch
black night sky.

43c20261-ac38-47b4-a22f-86756bca824f-0
01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:24.068
The paper boat is now in an area
where there is a giant iceberg

43c20261-ac38-47b4-a22f-86756bca824f-1
01:25:24.068 --> 01:25:29.195
behind it. So the Berg itself is
kind of more of a plateau and

43c20261-ac38-47b4-a22f-86756bca824f-2
01:25:29.195 --> 01:25:34.160
it's not like a mountain shaped
peaked iceberg, it's just a.

e71306dd-fb6d-493d-beed-d08179ae8c4f-0
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:39.419
A slab of ice, the ice itself
tower from the bottom of the

e71306dd-fb6d-493d-beed-d08179ae8c4f-1
01:25:39.419 --> 01:25:44.224
page all the way to the top, so
you get the impression that it

e71306dd-fb6d-493d-beed-d08179ae8c4f-2
01:25:44.224 --> 01:25:45.140
is enormous.

dc580c05-a0e1-4d23-9838-8f309534885a-0
01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.590
The paper boat is.

e09cb3d9-0ce0-4f07-8812-73ea8a35bc80-0
01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:56.836
Is now still on the surface of
the water, but it is entering a

e09cb3d9-0ce0-4f07-8812-73ea8a35bc80-1
01:25:56.836 --> 01:26:00.930
cave system that's made of ice,
as implied by the.

50b2a67d-45e1-479c-809c-d9c0e50c7bda-0
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:06.959
You know sheet sheets of ice
that have been broken up around

50b2a67d-45e1-479c-809c-d9c0e50c7bda-1
01:26:06.959 --> 01:26:11.513
it and floating around it and
the the ice cave mouth is pretty

50b2a67d-45e1-479c-809c-d9c0e50c7bda-2
01:26:11.513 --> 01:26:12.020
jagged.

496630f0-ac17-4ec8-8c4c-47f1d23e2667-0
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:17.032
And then in the next scene on
the right, we see it navigating,

496630f0-ac17-4ec8-8c4c-47f1d23e2667-1
01:26:17.032 --> 01:26:17.500
sort of.

c259b2ff-adff-4fcd-9af0-885056655d7c-0
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:23.150
Tunnel system inside this ice
cave. So you can kind of see the

c259b2ff-adff-4fcd-9af0-885056655d7c-1
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:27.987
dark sky, a sliver of a dark sky
that had had come from, and it

c259b2ff-adff-4fcd-9af0-885056655d7c-2
01:26:27.987 --> 01:26:29.650
is navigating its way.

95cdc02d-fb55-413e-811a-da5858f5d7a8-0
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.280
Further into the ice cave.

690d113d-a14a-40c6-813e-a755460bf3e3-0
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:37.600
So.

e8badc4c-a7f9-4abe-a1ee-e1710a822435-0
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.470
Still close by the area of the
icebergs.

a888abf0-bff4-4634-b203-db3fa3b7926e-0
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.966
I don't know if it's in The Cave
or not. I don't think so. Maybe

a888abf0-bff4-4634-b203-db3fa3b7926e-1
01:26:49.966 --> 01:26:53.538
it is. It's hard to say because
the sky is black here, so it

a888abf0-bff4-4634-b203-db3fa3b7926e-2
01:26:53.538 --> 01:26:56.993
could have emerged from The
Cave. Or it could just be that

a888abf0-bff4-4634-b203-db3fa3b7926e-3
01:26:56.993 --> 01:27:00.390
The Cave ceiling is really
black. But there is something.

af6da52f-8287-40c2-be5f-4efd490c87e5-0
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.919
Something investigating the
paper boat which is still

af6da52f-8287-40c2-be5f-4efd490c87e5-1
01:27:05.919 --> 01:27:10.280
floating on the water. It has
its tentacle reaching out from

af6da52f-8287-40c2-be5f-4efd490c87e5-2
01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.426
under the water and shining a
light on the paper boat. So

af6da52f-8287-40c2-be5f-4efd490c87e5-3
01:27:14.426 --> 01:27:18.857
this, this looks biological of
some kind. I mean like this is

af6da52f-8287-40c2-be5f-4efd490c87e5-4
01:27:18.857 --> 01:27:23.361
this is not an electric light,
this is an animal using part of

af6da52f-8287-40c2-be5f-4efd490c87e5-5
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:27.650
its bioluminescent body to shine
a light on the paper boat.

e411bf48-853f-4c7b-8f77-32b90b68b8c1-0
01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:34.633
And the next scene there is what
looks to be a deep sea diver

e411bf48-853f-4c7b-8f77-32b90b68b8c1-1
01:27:34.633 --> 01:27:40.646
holding the paper boat in its
hand, except the hand is just a

e411bf48-853f-4c7b-8f77-32b90b68b8c1-2
01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:41.809
fin and the.

2f6dd98a-62ec-4b3e-a97d-b15f8dbb12a8-0
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:47.730
Materials coming out of this
suit.

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-0
01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:53.171
Which, I mean, it has a belt, it
has sleeves, it's got a diving

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-1
01:27:53.171 --> 01:27:57.819
helmet. But Even so, like the
materials that are coming out of

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-2
01:27:57.819 --> 01:28:02.392
it look organic. So oh, and then
there's another diver that's

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-3
01:28:02.392 --> 01:28:06.892
just emerging from the water in
the background. So the diver

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-4
01:28:06.892 --> 01:28:11.466
holding the paper boat has a 08
on its diving helmet, and the

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-5
01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:16.261
one just coming out of the water
has a 05 with some steam coming

6e46927d-096f-4b3d-8750-901eed3a2e44-6
01:28:16.261 --> 01:28:18.180
out the top of the helmet.

706ad55a-afc0-48d7-b1c9-678f15f337cf-0
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.300
And it.

5b06c318-0099-44dd-8fed-b679df053651-0
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:22.070
Has um.

d3aeb9e0-09db-4311-941a-0afcfe11ad22-0
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:27.730
These, uh, this kind of like
telescoped.

ff8088b3-a18c-45a7-8dd7-034b65d9c26d-0
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:35.040
Eyes that are just jutting out
from the the helmet part of its

ff8088b3-a18c-45a7-8dd7-034b65d9c26d-1
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.043
head and once again there's
white light, glowing light

ff8088b3-a18c-45a7-8dd7-034b65d9c26d-2
01:28:40.043 --> 01:28:42.590
that's coming from the eyes.

2d75c623-3b19-4216-bf6f-c675ad53c961-0
01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:47.820
OK.

d3d301b2-0c92-4aba-a4ce-08079d5fadd2-0
01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:49.100
So.

a2552249-50d9-417e-b65e-f64b7e353a67-0
01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.080
There's a giant ship in this
scene and it takes up.

c79f3b26-3365-44de-887f-74befcd11655-0
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:57.420
Almost the entire scene.

e495b8d1-8c8b-4757-9780-ccbe64a2ed18-0
01:28:58.910 --> 01:29:03.072
The ship is coming towards the
paper boat and it looks like

e495b8d1-8c8b-4757-9780-ccbe64a2ed18-1
01:29:03.072 --> 01:29:04.460
it's daylight again.

de5ad793-c739-4fbe-885e-60a9606d49f4-0
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:10.376
There one of the tentacles that
was coming out of the diving

de5ad793-c739-4fbe-885e-60a9606d49f4-1
01:29:10.376 --> 01:29:10.770
suit.

96cf03d1-bdfa-4192-93d1-a9fddc817973-0
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:14.700
Still up above the water
surface.

52a06437-9bf3-46cb-aed7-beb82d60be72-0
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:18.530
But it seems to have caught
sight of the.

5c44c4b6-0f0d-4c3b-b684-f4ae9c58f715-0
01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:24.870
Oncoming ship and looks alarmed.
There's like lines coming out of

5c44c4b6-0f0d-4c3b-b684-f4ae9c58f715-1
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:29.392
it, as if it's like really
taking in this scene and the

5c44c4b6-0f0d-4c3b-b684-f4ae9c58f715-2
01:29:29.392 --> 01:29:34.157
paper boat is just kind of in
the foreground, just kind of

5c44c4b6-0f0d-4c3b-b684-f4ae9c58f715-3
01:29:34.157 --> 01:29:38.518
there, as this giant ship
emitting just tons of black

5c44c4b6-0f0d-4c3b-b684-f4ae9c58f715-4
01:29:38.518 --> 01:29:42.880
smoke out of its smokestacks is
approaching the ship.

485e47ff-9e11-4a8f-aa3b-f27418139c16-0
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:49.099
And I think there's a whale's
tail. So this might be a whaling

485e47ff-9e11-4a8f-aa3b-f27418139c16-1
01:29:49.099 --> 01:29:53.231
ship? It's hard to say, but I
think that there's like a a

485e47ff-9e11-4a8f-aa3b-f27418139c16-2
01:29:53.231 --> 01:29:57.507
crank hoist, you know like
pulley system and it looks as if

485e47ff-9e11-4a8f-aa3b-f27418139c16-3
01:29:57.507 --> 01:30:01.639
a big whale had been pulled out
of the water by the ship.

77de8dd9-518f-4ae9-ac45-f35316be1753-0
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:04.520
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that
that's what that is.

675dedf8-3298-4d27-ae90-cc70db5df381-0
01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:11.049
In this scene we see the paper
boat, which is looking a little

675dedf8-3298-4d27-ae90-cc70db5df381-1
01:30:11.049 --> 01:30:11.420
soggy.

0a827571-a385-4bd3-b20f-62eeaab46215-0
01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:18.505
Heading towards an offshore oil
rig that's also emitting a just

0a827571-a385-4bd3-b20f-62eeaab46215-1
01:30:18.505 --> 01:30:23.193
ton of black smoke. In fact,
it's so black that there's no

0a827571-a385-4bd3-b20f-62eeaab46215-2
01:30:23.193 --> 01:30:28.199
sky to be seen, and all of these
birds seem to be falling from

0a827571-a385-4bd3-b20f-62eeaab46215-3
01:30:28.199 --> 01:30:33.046
the sky and into the water.
There's one that landed into the

0a827571-a385-4bd3-b20f-62eeaab46215-4
01:30:33.046 --> 01:30:37.972
paper boat, and there's another
whale that had been caught by

0a827571-a385-4bd3-b20f-62eeaab46215-5
01:30:37.972 --> 01:30:42.740
one of these pulleys. I think
the implication here is just.

299fd0bb-ebb6-44f4-a5f5-fe192fbf1839-0
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.520
Yeah.

83d2dd81-0cf0-4d9a-b0f3-6f1858879745-0
01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.100
This.

05f43ab8-57ae-433f-b1ae-28a5af176224-0
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:49.896
This piece of technology, this
man-made structure, is just

05f43ab8-57ae-433f-b1ae-28a5af176224-1
01:30:49.896 --> 01:30:53.140
polluting the world and killing
everything in it.

51be5a74-8e48-4e9d-afd6-e864ede99701-0
01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:57.455
Others dead fish too. It looks
like there's dead fish just like

51be5a74-8e48-4e9d-afd6-e864ede99701-1
01:30:57.455 --> 01:30:59.410
laying on the surface of the
water.

ef8e0647-af26-4da3-b5dd-40b7515fdf61-0
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.000
Oh, so next we see some.

b279bca5-2852-4f1a-bdfa-d11a2d990115-0
01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:14.278
Action happening from Windows, I
guess probably in that

b279bca5-2852-4f1a-bdfa-d11a2d990115-1
01:31:14.278 --> 01:31:18.321
structure. And there are people
leaning out the windows holding

b279bca5-2852-4f1a-bdfa-d11a2d990115-2
01:31:18.321 --> 01:31:22.301
some kind of guns or something,
and they're shooting down into

b279bca5-2852-4f1a-bdfa-d11a2d990115-3
01:31:22.301 --> 01:31:26.092
the water. And one of them that
is closest down towards the

b279bca5-2852-4f1a-bdfa-d11a2d990115-4
01:31:26.092 --> 01:31:29.946
water is actually shooting up
the paper boat, which seems to

b279bca5-2852-4f1a-bdfa-d11a2d990115-5
01:31:29.946 --> 01:31:33.990
have gotten nicked through the
top of its mast, its paper mast.

fc4cc1a4-ce57-493b-b702-436d0fbab39e-0
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:35.640
And.

bf33568b-1ce2-4f8f-8275-2ea91a194f09-0
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:41.845
I think the creature with the
diving helmet is back. It looks

bf33568b-1ce2-4f8f-8275-2ea91a194f09-1
01:31:41.845 --> 01:31:45.340
as if it's also here on the
scene, but.

11b0c888-07b4-445c-ab27-25e97c5f00fb-0
01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:51.467
From the from the rig they were
lowing down like a claw on a

11b0c888-07b4-445c-ab27-25e97c5f00fb-1
01:31:51.467 --> 01:31:56.701
chain. So I think what they're,
I think what they're trying to

11b0c888-07b4-445c-ab27-25e97c5f00fb-2
01:31:56.701 --> 01:31:58.280
do is just capture.

09c522ed-6d19-48c7-99fc-574dbbd96bae-0
01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.260
The diving helmet creature.

693bd002-5756-4d27-a9ed-9bbe37911c64-0
01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:07.759
In the next scene we have the
diving helmet creature standing

693bd002-5756-4d27-a9ed-9bbe37911c64-1
01:32:07.759 --> 01:32:08.010
on.

fd0cad2d-0dbf-4a19-9767-a53b7b929201-0
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:13.490
A device you know like some some
kind of a.

43cbf286-f502-4830-b670-a75b64e811b8-0
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:23.280
It it looks as if it is a
underwater.

2a7311d7-c4c9-47f5-a791-17281406511e-0
01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:30.290
I don't know, just like a kind
of transportation.

9ae9e1aa-26ff-4d8e-9598-2b8bdad7e9a2-0
01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.851
Thing that you would do if you
needed to move around

9ae9e1aa-26ff-4d8e-9598-2b8bdad7e9a2-1
01:32:34.851 --> 01:32:37.770
underwater. I don't know what
these things are called.

9c6d7f5d-b6d0-46b3-bd4d-44627816f174-0
01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.793
You know, kind of like a jet
ski, but that it goes

9c6d7f5d-b6d0-46b3-bd4d-44627816f174-1
01:32:42.793 --> 01:32:46.639
underwater. So anyway, this jet
ski kind of a thing looks like

9c6d7f5d-b6d0-46b3-bd4d-44627816f174-2
01:32:46.639 --> 01:32:50.302
it's been painted like crudely
to look like some kind of an

9c6d7f5d-b6d0-46b3-bd4d-44627816f174-3
01:32:50.302 --> 01:32:50.730
animal.

618396b3-6131-41e6-bc3e-f0eb9f00aed6-0
01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:58.375
And so the the diving helmet
creature is standing on top of

618396b3-6131-41e6-bc3e-f0eb9f00aed6-1
01:32:58.375 --> 01:33:00.220
the jet ski dog.

518581a7-6066-4436-aaa4-cf632bdc71bb-0
01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.355
The the motor of which is going
crazy. So I think that the motor

518581a7-6066-4436-aaa4-cf632bdc71bb-1
01:33:06.355 --> 01:33:10.611
was probably pierced by the claw
that came down or by shots that

518581a7-6066-4436-aaa4-cf632bdc71bb-2
01:33:10.611 --> 01:33:14.866
had been fired. And now now it's
sinking and I think he's trying

518581a7-6066-4436-aaa4-cf632bdc71bb-3
01:33:14.866 --> 01:33:18.926
to figure out like what to do.
Meanwhile, the paper boat's in

518581a7-6066-4436-aaa4-cf632bdc71bb-4
01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:22.854
the foreground and we see that
it had been shot through the

518581a7-6066-4436-aaa4-cf632bdc71bb-5
01:33:22.854 --> 01:33:26.390
mast and there is a life
preserver on the paper boat.

df84987c-6b54-42b0-9b82-33ec647dd4d3-0
01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:30.710
OK.

28aeb4d4-6dfb-4527-b870-2cd38c1d1f49-0
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:37.244
So the life preserver was used
by the diving helmet creature

28aeb4d4-6dfb-4527-b870-2cd38c1d1f49-1
01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:43.355
and they crawled up inside of it
and are holding on to the paper

28aeb4d4-6dfb-4527-b870-2cd38c1d1f49-2
01:33:43.355 --> 01:33:44.860
boat via a rope.

afbcaeaf-859d-49fc-bc5b-f6a6c222da3a-0
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:47.520
That was.

f40edc4b-6c4e-419b-8ea9-a7a098e1e769-0
01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.460
Connecting the life preserver to
the paper boat.

4728db35-2f06-49c9-852e-dd167c1e871e-0
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:56.598
And the sea has gotten really
choppy. We can see some like

4728db35-2f06-49c9-852e-dd167c1e871e-1
01:33:56.598 --> 01:34:00.220
really big waves, some huge
waves we see.

0e0aeb11-4ddc-453d-a5cb-daf370fcab0f-0
01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:05.887
We see another like team of
creatures that's on its way

0e0aeb11-4ddc-453d-a5cb-daf370fcab0f-1
01:34:05.887 --> 01:34:07.810
coming towards the paper boat.

383a9024-b34f-4207-b09d-a789f6f98ba5-0
01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:14.963
In this Nautilus shell we see
these night creatures, you know,

383a9024-b34f-4207-b09d-a789f6f98ba5-1
01:34:14.963 --> 01:34:16.140
kind of like.

a1a1ba1d-f1ba-454a-8276-fee3c7e9676f-0
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.884
We see the moon knight creature
from before that is up in the

a1a1ba1d-f1ba-454a-8276-fee3c7e9676f-1
01:34:22.884 --> 01:34:27.532
crow's nest of the mast that's
stuck inside of this Nautilus

a1a1ba1d-f1ba-454a-8276-fee3c7e9676f-2
01:34:27.532 --> 01:34:27.990
shell.

2e4b7738-cbad-4183-b52b-dd5951414309-0
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:31.410
And then below is.

752af52f-acc4-46c1-a78a-a1aa8d504461-0
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:39.285
The the cat and some other
fantasy creatures like a deer

752af52f-acc4-46c1-a78a-a1aa8d504461-1
01:34:39.285 --> 01:34:40.520
and a horse.

1da73009-8542-48d2-8341-4b94f0190fb8-0
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:46.443
And I can't tell what that
checkered thing is. Um, you

1da73009-8542-48d2-8341-4b94f0190fb8-1
01:34:46.443 --> 01:34:51.222
know, two faceless
anthropomorphized creatures that

1da73009-8542-48d2-8341-4b94f0190fb8-2
01:34:51.222 --> 01:34:57.286
just look like they don't really
have any distinguishing features

1da73009-8542-48d2-8341-4b94f0190fb8-3
01:34:57.286 --> 01:35:03.075
like, at all. And other fantasy
creatures with, you know, like

1da73009-8542-48d2-8341-4b94f0190fb8-4
01:35:03.075 --> 01:35:08.864
snake tails and it looks like
like mechanical wings with holes

1da73009-8542-48d2-8341-4b94f0190fb8-5
01:35:08.864 --> 01:35:09.600
in them.

98ac9cc1-8546-4eab-83d4-2a37b63533cc-0
01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.320
And sailing.

d70d7cc1-826a-40d0-a640-a5d3c5683db2-0
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:17.330
Sailing behind the mast is this
giant kite.

8c214f4d-b5c9-43f2-9036-9d8ba37c26a1-0
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:18.930
With like a.

db23bfc9-b603-474c-8320-44908bab8f3a-0
01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:24.820
Like a diamond shaped kite with
all sorts of stars.

8c99a51f-63ca-47ec-bfe6-c71f474013c6-0
01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:26.410
On the fabric.

b08b55f1-c26b-463f-b15c-dfda2af40a7c-0
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:28.040
The pattern.

efb37215-4659-4d4a-b3da-3adc5d118d71-0
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:36.133
OK, so the sea's gotten real
rough and now the waves are

efb37215-4659-4d4a-b3da-3adc5d118d71-1
01:35:36.133 --> 01:35:40.055
really high and they are
circling around and the paper

efb37215-4659-4d4a-b3da-3adc5d118d71-2
01:35:40.055 --> 01:35:41.410
boat is I think in.

0be02a7c-bf28-437a-b8a1-63138e7c6949-0
01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.134
Probably some pretty serious
danger. I mean like it is being

0be02a7c-bf28-437a-b8a1-63138e7c6949-1
01:35:46.134 --> 01:35:49.420
swept up in one of these giant
tsunami sized waves.

c0907185-88a1-4033-ac07-c7803c6fce0e-0
01:35:50.250 --> 01:35:54.310
And so that's kind of happening
like in the middle ground sort

c0907185-88a1-4033-ac07-c7803c6fce0e-1
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:58.177
of in the background and in the
foreground we see like this

c0907185-88a1-4033-ac07-c7803c6fce0e-2
01:35:58.177 --> 01:35:58.500
team.

1ac5a4a3-49af-4fd8-a47f-bd0f5ac34eb4-0
01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:03.465
Of creatures that's inside of
this Nautilus shell, and it

1ac5a4a3-49af-4fd8-a47f-bd0f5ac34eb4-1
01:36:03.465 --> 01:36:07.700
looks as if you know like
they're doing their own repair.

1ac5a4a3-49af-4fd8-a47f-bd0f5ac34eb4-2
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:12.082
The kite got torn, so like the
two ambiguous creatures, and

1ac5a4a3-49af-4fd8-a47f-bd0f5ac34eb4-3
01:36:12.082 --> 01:36:14.929
they kind of look like two small
boys.

e227c2e1-e6ce-4e88-9490-931af2dcec8e-0
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:21.065
Are clinging onto the kite maybe
trying to do repairs or I don't

e227c2e1-e6ce-4e88-9490-931af2dcec8e-1
01:36:21.065 --> 01:36:25.590
know, just kind of hanging out
on this broken kite and the cat.

18994fbd-7be5-48dd-84e2-4f3286d033c9-0
01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:30.754
Which now looks like a normal
cat is walking along one of the

18994fbd-7be5-48dd-84e2-4f3286d033c9-1
01:36:30.754 --> 01:36:34.822
lines to try to. I don't know,
it's holding something in its

18994fbd-7be5-48dd-84e2-4f3286d033c9-2
01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:39.156
tail. Maybe maybe some material
to help repair the kite. And the

18994fbd-7be5-48dd-84e2-4f3286d033c9-3
01:36:39.156 --> 01:36:39.890
moon knight

d9edba7b-5ba2-48d1-9b97-259a0e39061a-0
01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:44.930
Is is once again at the very top
of the mast, but now is holding

d9edba7b-5ba2-48d1-9b97-259a0e39061a-1
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:48.454
something in his hand and it
looks like a giant paper

d9edba7b-5ba2-48d1-9b97-259a0e39061a-2
01:36:48.454 --> 01:36:52.630
airplane, and he's pointing it
towards where the paper boat is.

98dc06d4-0a1c-4d11-ae33-76816400fc19-0
01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:56.990
So maybe he'll watch it in the
next scene.

e17be800-0c97-4f4a-872a-6e7bc2d73c58-0
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.130
All right. So paper boat.

4c9d85fa-d0fa-45bb-bddd-c887920bf12a-0
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:06.860
Still sailing safely on the top
of the water.

b8d893da-6536-4445-890f-2075947bf8dc-0
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:13.825
But now we see in the sky all of
these incredible, ominous black

b8d893da-6536-4445-890f-2075947bf8dc-1
01:37:13.825 --> 01:37:19.039
clouds and a huge strike of
lightning coming through the sky

b8d893da-6536-4445-890f-2075947bf8dc-2
01:37:19.039 --> 01:37:23.740
and striking the surface of the
water in the distance.

45c1c4b8-587c-4d69-8d76-8e5c4541f6a9-0
01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:29.140
Sort of above the paper boat and
the sky is a giant paper

45c1c4b8-587c-4d69-8d76-8e5c4541f6a9-1
01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:32.640
airplane that seems to just be
darting right past.

53a0606f-6324-494e-8c50-3c57543f78db-0
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:38.210
Um, so.

ea7e9916-dc8a-44e7-a491-124ffd334e9c-0
01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:43.736
Here, the paper boat, still
afloat on the surface of the

ea7e9916-dc8a-44e7-a491-124ffd334e9c-1
01:37:43.736 --> 01:37:45.660
sea, is now navigating.

a9624525-74c7-4448-b5d6-6287539921f9-0
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:49.040
Series of.

c794c626-f47c-4138-8603-6667c9fd414c-0
01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:50.770
Arches.

e963a323-f40e-4ba3-a689-6f5172ca18f6-0
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:54.180
It almost looks like a field of
Donuts.

e85c0a20-7280-4349-984a-87597e9e6383-0
01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.800
But the arches have um.

c776e43f-3e32-4d60-b51d-7f0abe45e792-0
01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:04.415
Dork Fins across their backs, so
it's almost like they're

c776e43f-3e32-4d60-b51d-7f0abe45e792-1
01:38:04.415 --> 01:38:10.141
multiple eels, or multiple
tentacles of some kind like of a

c776e43f-3e32-4d60-b51d-7f0abe45e792-2
01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:13.100
creature or multiple creatures.

59733e9a-1a04-4bdd-a055-9b2d66d6e79d-0
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.386
Just kind of like surfacing
their parts of their body around

59733e9a-1a04-4bdd-a055-9b2d66d6e79d-1
01:38:18.386 --> 01:38:19.980
this area, but there's.

2a835635-ec46-4f07-9fce-bdd7b61c3d76-0
01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:24.643
Dozens of them and you can't
even see the water they're so

2a835635-ec46-4f07-9fce-bdd7b61c3d76-1
01:38:24.643 --> 01:38:25.320
packed in.

ddd01537-2298-449b-8a43-cc3ffadcaeb2-0
01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:30.986
One of the tentacles had reached
up and grabbed the paper plane

ddd01537-2298-449b-8a43-cc3ffadcaeb2-1
01:38:30.986 --> 01:38:35.542
out of the sky with its mouth. I
think I see glowing eyes there.

ddd01537-2298-449b-8a43-cc3ffadcaeb2-2
01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:39.888
So yeah, I think that one of
them had surfaced enough to grab

ddd01537-2298-449b-8a43-cc3ffadcaeb2-3
01:38:39.888 --> 01:38:41.079
that paper plane.

dd85457e-d8c1-491b-8f96-217335a3126e-0
01:38:46.730 --> 01:38:54.350
OK, so here we're in the thick
of the eel arch.

e4518abc-ac4b-4bea-bd5a-f9fa4f3c9870-0
01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:56.850
Um, obstacle course.

5a2413b0-c896-4438-a69e-2accbe9bbb6f-0
01:38:57.770 --> 01:39:02.037
So there's just like dark
archways all over the scene,

5a2413b0-c896-4438-a69e-2accbe9bbb6f-1
01:39:02.037 --> 01:39:06.461
sort of in the middle we we see
the head of one of these

5a2413b0-c896-4438-a69e-2accbe9bbb6f-2
01:39:06.461 --> 01:39:10.806
creatures that's just kind of
like poking underneath an

5a2413b0-c896-4438-a69e-2accbe9bbb6f-3
01:39:10.806 --> 01:39:15.695
archway with its glowing eyes
and its toothed open mouth, just

5a2413b0-c896-4438-a69e-2accbe9bbb6f-4
01:39:15.695 --> 01:39:19.420
looking down at where the paper
boat was or is.

e5ab74b6-ae29-4355-b308-6ea8300b00d0-0
01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.828
And then to the side, we kind of
see through some of the archways

e5ab74b6-ae29-4355-b308-6ea8300b00d0-1
01:39:24.828 --> 01:39:27.480
enough that we can see kind of
open water.

ff34f178-dd04-41f0-8d46-9c3c091e9a1d-0
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:33.781
Behind and we see a couple of
additional creatures, kind of

ff34f178-dd04-41f0-8d46-9c3c091e9a1d-1
01:39:33.781 --> 01:39:37.660
like looking towards this area,
one of them.

0c51c594-9f89-40f4-b97d-e63c30cf93f9-0
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:40.990
Has a narwhal.

b7661221-ddb1-45a6-a0a5-1a2cf74623d6-0
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:43.550
Style like horn or Tusk.

bad5018f-8024-4326-8cb5-03887ec1ef16-0
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:49.800
And but otherwise kind of looks
like an alligator and another

bad5018f-8024-4326-8cb5-03887ec1ef16-1
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.680
one has a.

31ccb5f9-e81d-44da-9b1e-df24a51e03de-0
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:59.500
Like big sawed snout. Like a
like a sawfish saw.

be16b671-f109-482b-802f-36be06fe27c6-0
01:40:01.530 --> 01:40:05.390
Like a sawed there's a kind of a
shark that has this. It's kind

be16b671-f109-482b-802f-36be06fe27c6-1
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:07.080
of, I forget the name of it.

4e2bbc75-8795-49b4-97df-4de41161a88c-0
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.620
But yeah, so it's it's got like
a saw beak.

a21724cd-29a0-4370-951c-24ad32cb42a3-0
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:18.030
OK.

fb35bd1f-4814-4471-b73c-59869352affe-0
01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:24.261
All right, so here the paper
boat, still floating, is getting

fb35bd1f-4814-4471-b73c-59869352affe-1
01:40:24.261 --> 01:40:29.107
waterlogged. The narwhal
creature is shooting all of this

fb35bd1f-4814-4471-b73c-59869352affe-2
01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:34.288
water from its snout down onto
the paper boat, just drenching

fb35bd1f-4814-4471-b73c-59869352affe-3
01:40:34.288 --> 01:40:39.553
it. And the saw nosed creature
is kind of like to its side, so

fb35bd1f-4814-4471-b73c-59869352affe-4
01:40:39.553 --> 01:40:44.400
kind of to the side of the
narwhal creature, kind of just

fb35bd1f-4814-4471-b73c-59869352affe-5
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.080
like looking on, but not really
doing much of anything.

4bc9db11-50fc-40c4-b212-8bc6d474a6a1-0
01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:50.620
Umm.

83873f2a-07b5-4c93-8474-c32675f72ab0-0
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:57.279
And then from our perspective on
the next scene it we see some

83873f2a-07b5-4c93-8474-c32675f72ab0-1
01:40:57.279 --> 01:41:02.425
land in the foreground and we
see some sea and sky and clouds

83873f2a-07b5-4c93-8474-c32675f72ab0-2
01:41:02.425 --> 01:41:03.920
in the background.

247ec67f-b2ce-4172-b3ff-60fd31bdcf63-0
01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:10.000
And we see the paper boat kind
of just starting to go under.

3a08c90f-10e9-4a5f-a737-43f828af8475-0
01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:11.970
Like it

2a86e231-6931-493e-9144-cb02a07e6ad0-0
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.363
Very not seaworthy, I think,
after all it's been through,

2a86e231-6931-493e-9144-cb02a07e6ad0-1
01:41:16.363 --> 01:41:18.550
especially being drenched in
water.

099b32da-6c5c-45b9-8b83-8b2eb8ae1794-0
01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:24.542
And on this scene with the land
in the foreground, we see all

099b32da-6c5c-45b9-8b83-8b2eb8ae1794-1
01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:29.635
sorts of just trash and detritus
and jetsam that's been washed

099b32da-6c5c-45b9-8b83-8b2eb8ae1794-2
01:41:29.635 --> 01:41:33.920
ashore and and standing there is
an anthropomorphic.

e8fa72b4-f28d-49dc-add0-25a008a39711-0
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:39.120
fish, that's got on it, you
know.

8b260302-2115-4d82-a9f8-766c876e533b-0
01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:44.830
Small little bathing suit.

9fce2b24-43c3-439d-a367-1bf25fd78345-0
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:49.361
And just kind of like looking
out at sea, but also kind of

9fce2b24-43c3-439d-a367-1bf25fd78345-1
01:41:49.361 --> 01:41:52.392
like looking at the sky. It
doesn't look as if it's really

9fce2b24-43c3-439d-a367-1bf25fd78345-2
01:41:52.392 --> 01:41:53.420
looking at the boat.

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-0
01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.469
And here we see the paper boat
making its descent underwater.

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-1
01:42:03.469 --> 01:42:07.776
It has sunk and it is now
surrounded by jellyfish. It's

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-2
01:42:07.776 --> 01:42:12.084
just really kind of going
through this entire school of

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-3
01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:16.853
jellyfish. There's barely any
water visible because all these

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-4
01:42:16.853 --> 01:42:21.084
jellyfish are so crammed close
together. And there's a

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-5
01:42:21.084 --> 01:42:25.468
particularly giant jellyfish,
which is kind of coming up

52ce33a6-6aa1-4b7f-ad6c-13330e4c4f50-6
01:42:25.468 --> 01:42:27.930
through the middle of the scene.

bee85184-4b2c-41cc-a56c-fa9414e4f4be-0
01:42:28.290 --> 01:42:32.166
That's the closest to the paper
boat, but it doesn't look as if

bee85184-4b2c-41cc-a56c-fa9414e4f4be-1
01:42:32.166 --> 01:42:35.740
any interaction is happening
between them. Only the top of

bee85184-4b2c-41cc-a56c-fa9414e4f4be-2
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.192
the jellyfish looks like it
could be a giant eye, and if

bee85184-4b2c-41cc-a56c-fa9414e4f4be-3
01:42:39.192 --> 01:42:42.887
that's the case, it does look
like it's looking at the paper

bee85184-4b2c-41cc-a56c-fa9414e4f4be-4
01:42:42.887 --> 01:42:43.189
boat.

e5278088-241f-441b-9d96-30e5ef3ec20e-0
01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:52.379
So from here the paper boat is
still underwater and it has

e5278088-241f-441b-9d96-30e5ef3ec20e-1
01:42:52.379 --> 01:42:56.365
gotten sort of attached to
school of fish that are swimming

e5278088-241f-441b-9d96-30e5ef3ec20e-2
01:42:56.365 --> 01:43:00.351
off to the side towards the
left. Below that are other fish

e5278088-241f-441b-9d96-30e5ef3ec20e-3
01:43:00.351 --> 01:43:04.470
and other sea creatures that are
just kind of hanging around.

f8c21bf6-6029-4d61-b255-d321e716681d-0
01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.557
And in the next scene, the paper
boat continues its descent. The

f8c21bf6-6029-4d61-b255-d321e716681d-1
01:43:10.557 --> 01:43:15.103
look of these creatures with the
bioluminescent fins and parts of

f8c21bf6-6029-4d61-b255-d321e716681d-2
01:43:15.103 --> 01:43:19.512
their bodies implies, and that
the darkness of the water around

f8c21bf6-6029-4d61-b255-d321e716681d-3
01:43:19.512 --> 01:43:23.576
implies, that it's just sinking
deeper and deeper into the

f8c21bf6-6029-4d61-b255-d321e716681d-4
01:43:23.576 --> 01:43:23.990
ocean.

c5ead75e-7c3b-42e4-a698-0c9aec98bf7b-0
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:33.462
And then in this scene the boat
has hit the bottom of the sea

c5ead75e-7c3b-42e4-a698-0c9aec98bf7b-1
01:43:33.462 --> 01:43:38.448
floor and there are these slug
type creatures but with many

c5ead75e-7c3b-42e4-a698-0c9aec98bf7b-2
01:43:38.448 --> 01:43:43.601
arms and a couple of antenna
just kind of hovering in and and

c5ead75e-7c3b-42e4-a698-0c9aec98bf7b-3
01:43:43.601 --> 01:43:48.920
looking. One of them is inside
the boat, one of them is up over

c5ead75e-7c3b-42e4-a698-0c9aec98bf7b-4
01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:54.405
the mast bending it over. One of
them is kind of still on the the

c5ead75e-7c3b-42e4-a698-0c9aec98bf7b-5
01:43:54.405 --> 01:43:57.480
sea floor but looking up inside
the.

187aa8a2-6bd7-4276-994f-a8a6e6157a38-0
01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:01.747
The the paper boat, and we see
like a beam of light just

187aa8a2-6bd7-4276-994f-a8a6e6157a38-1
01:44:01.747 --> 01:44:06.476
shining on these creatures. But
if they're at the very bottom of

187aa8a2-6bd7-4276-994f-a8a6e6157a38-2
01:44:06.476 --> 01:44:10.986
the sea, you know, the question
is where is this being flight

187aa8a2-6bd7-4276-994f-a8a6e6157a38-3
01:44:10.986 --> 01:44:11.859
coming from?

d87c47d0-a6f7-4c9e-90bf-6b4b33cb98c0-0
01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.530
In the next scene we see.

969e0907-91c2-4bc3-98d6-f07168717c45-0
01:44:17.010 --> 01:44:21.010
We we see a submarine and the
submarine has.

d82d0041-c706-4a9d-a1c1-539abd2d8692-0
01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:22.700
Um.

a5dfb858-f3d9-4e69-b2bf-561af4508dd2-0
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:26.780
Like a a headlight, I guess. I
don't know if it's called a

a5dfb858-f3d9-4e69-b2bf-561af4508dd2-1
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:29.720
headlight on a submarine, but
that's what it's acting as.

4b71fe06-17ed-4661-9786-e4379a7748c4-0
01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:35.263
And the submarine is now heading
up towards the surface of the

4b71fe06-17ed-4661-9786-e4379a7748c4-1
01:44:35.263 --> 01:44:38.538
water, except that the paper
boat is on the nose of the

4b71fe06-17ed-4661-9786-e4379a7748c4-2
01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:41.169
submarine, kind of like where
the light was.

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-0
01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:45.700
So you get the impression that
the submarine went down there to

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-1
01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:49.190
find the paper boat and is now
rescuing it and bringing it back

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-2
01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:52.572
up to the surface. Meanwhile,
there's lots of other creatures

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-3
01:44:52.572 --> 01:44:55.953
with glowing eyes, and it's very
evident now from the glowing

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-4
01:44:55.953 --> 01:44:59.171
eyes that this helps them
underwater, because they're they

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-5
01:44:59.171 --> 01:45:02.443
show us beams of light coming
out of each of the creatures,

aa9b6572-f077-4391-be3c-16152a06a751-6
01:45:02.443 --> 01:45:04.680
like they're shining flashlights
around.

387fac34-de61-4a9d-9bc5-dfaa56366930-0
01:45:05.490 --> 01:45:06.960
Around the submarine.

fb2fa3e5-4125-45d6-9f61-8b9394f32155-0
01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:13.036
OK, so the submarine makes it
back to the surface and all of

fb2fa3e5-4125-45d6-9f61-8b9394f32155-1
01:45:13.036 --> 01:45:15.780
this water starts pouring out of
the paper boat.

c1ad975d-79d3-4173-98ad-ed4502748f83-0
01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:20.626
And it's bright and it's white,
and that implies that there's a

c1ad975d-79d3-4173-98ad-ed4502748f83-1
01:45:20.626 --> 01:45:23.000
lot of light happening. It's
daylight again.

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-0
01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:30.025
So then in the next scene the
the paper boat is once again

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-1
01:45:30.025 --> 01:45:35.063
floating, except that it looks
like a giant squid had come from

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-2
01:45:35.063 --> 01:45:39.945
below and has latched onto a
fishing boat. The giant squid is

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-3
01:45:39.945 --> 01:45:44.038
holding all sorts of like
bottles and things in its

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-4
01:45:44.038 --> 01:45:48.998
tentacles that just looks like
bottles of cognac or something.

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-5
01:45:48.998 --> 01:45:53.958
I'm not really sure what it's
holding, and there's a couple of

aa9fcb79-5e9c-4e4f-8c0c-f421bcb4ce33-6
01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:54.510
people.

87717964-a108-4955-84c1-0bfd6b1c922a-0
01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.835
On the fishing boat that are,
you know, just like holding on

87717964-a108-4955-84c1-0bfd6b1c922a-1
01:45:58.835 --> 01:46:02.030
or trying to throw things at the
giant squid.

63472b23-46c5-437a-b9de-4f552d3b2f90-0
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:06.396
There's no submarine in this
scene, so I guess the submarine

63472b23-46c5-437a-b9de-4f552d3b2f90-1
01:46:06.396 --> 01:46:08.110
has already done its job and
left.

69d6f8ae-e9ab-4e48-b2aa-72479a7d7c66-0
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:13.803
The submarine ohh has a giant
like fishes' tail so I don't

69d6f8ae-e9ab-4e48-b2aa-72479a7d7c66-1
01:46:13.803 --> 01:46:17.320
know it's it's not mechanical,
it's a fish OK.

8a0e9e7f-84bc-4333-aa5b-c1cb17e91b7e-0
01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:18.890
So in this scene.

aa09957b-ba56-4892-a4f3-1a37204819c8-0
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.570
There's a group of harbor seals
and they're playing with the

aa09957b-ba56-4892-a4f3-1a37204819c8-1
01:46:24.570 --> 01:46:29.067
paper boat. One of them is
balancing the paper boat's stern

aa09957b-ba56-4892-a4f3-1a37204819c8-2
01:46:29.067 --> 01:46:31.389
on its on its nose while other.

7496c6c8-ace5-4c99-89a0-4f8b41a5216b-0
01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:36.653
Harbor seals look on. The seals
are kind of like just playing

7496c6c8-ace5-4c99-89a0-4f8b41a5216b-1
01:46:36.653 --> 01:46:39.991
and circling each other. In the
water below and to the right we

7496c6c8-ace5-4c99-89a0-4f8b41a5216b-2
01:46:39.991 --> 01:46:40.200
see.

329aff6b-a453-43de-9673-da84c7ca0671-0
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:44.619
Just like these in the next
scene that these fronds

329aff6b-a453-43de-9673-da84c7ca0671-1
01:46:44.619 --> 01:46:47.720
underwater fronds like
underwater seaweed.

a81791d3-c4f5-456b-8b80-89bd245e1b85-0
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.240
And there's some fish.

6dc51643-8c61-48ff-8b80-112a2e874fe9-0
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.420
Like.

c2b9ac8a-bdd6-48f2-988c-b40cc9e05211-0
01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.630
in amongst the seaweed.

411bcc1d-bb32-4b2a-ae82-212ff1184748-0
01:46:59.570 --> 01:47:02.986
Here is another underwater
seaweed scene. The paper boat

411bcc1d-bb32-4b2a-ae82-212ff1184748-1
01:47:02.986 --> 01:47:06.762
floats on top of the surface of
the water, but below the water

411bcc1d-bb32-4b2a-ae82-212ff1184748-2
01:47:06.762 --> 01:47:09.040
there's some jellyfish and some
fish.

8b68e731-170f-40ba-900b-2f9babdb9d4d-0
01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:14.520
A lot of seaweed and a couple of
additional cuttlefish.

c144671f-1b61-4507-ae2e-2d00d9159235-0
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:20.192
And in the next scene, the paper
boat continues to float on the

c144671f-1b61-4507-ae2e-2d00d9159235-1
01:47:20.192 --> 01:47:25.074
surface, but we see one of the
deep sea diver creatures that is

c144671f-1b61-4507-ae2e-2d00d9159235-2
01:47:25.074 --> 01:47:29.728
like kind of standing on the
tail of a giant creature that's

c144671f-1b61-4507-ae2e-2d00d9159235-3
01:47:29.728 --> 01:47:33.390
so big we can't really even see
all of it like.

cbcf0ae0-01c7-4d09-a780-4859ec5037df-0
01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:37.902
I think we see part of it and
then the rest of it is like kind

cbcf0ae0-01c7-4d09-a780-4859ec5037df-1
01:47:37.902 --> 01:47:41.280
of hidden amongst the seaweed
going into the background.

f226be60-529b-41e4-b139-e2a94734f3a2-0
01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.530
There's some kind of like a
mechanism set up.

98abe7d0-f4d1-43f1-8e66-0a281af38e00-0
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:52.655
And he's, he's got like a ride.
So instead of a horse, he's got

98abe7d0-f4d1-43f1-8e66-0a281af38e00-1
01:47:52.655 --> 01:47:57.371
a sea horse that's got a saddle
on it nearby. Presumably that's

98abe7d0-f4d1-43f1-8e66-0a281af38e00-2
01:47:57.371 --> 01:48:01.644
how he gets around and he's
holding it a oh, it's a clam.

98abe7d0-f4d1-43f1-8e66-0a281af38e00-3
01:48:01.644 --> 01:48:06.212
Oh, that's what it's meant to
be. OK all right. So he's using

98abe7d0-f4d1-43f1-8e66-0a281af38e00-4
01:48:06.212 --> 01:48:06.360
a.

4f189273-07e1-465d-bb79-8d1c13e61c43-0
01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:12.871
He's using a device to keep the
clamshell open and he's taking

4f189273-07e1-465d-bb79-8d1c13e61c43-1
01:48:12.871 --> 01:48:17.637
the Pearl out, and so then he's
going to probably get on to his

4f189273-07e1-465d-bb79-8d1c13e61c43-2
01:48:17.637 --> 01:48:20.170
seahorse and take the Pearl
away.

bd935ca8-90c4-4b1c-99ba-ebf4ce474d6f-0
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:26.780
OK, so from here we see a buoy,
um.

33ca8ce2-c81f-4140-87cd-18a80fe9868a-0
01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.288
We must be close to land, and
the deep sea diver has a basket

33ca8ce2-c81f-4140-87cd-18a80fe9868a-1
01:48:31.288 --> 01:48:35.206
on his sea horse horse that he
uses, and it seems like it's

33ca8ce2-c81f-4140-87cd-18a80fe9868a-2
01:48:35.206 --> 01:48:39.450
full of pearls. There's a couple
of other creatures that kind of

33ca8ce2-c81f-4140-87cd-18a80fe9868a-3
01:48:39.450 --> 01:48:43.368
defied description climbing up
the buoy that kind of looked

33ca8ce2-c81f-4140-87cd-18a80fe9868a-4
01:48:43.368 --> 01:48:45.849
like people, but with starfish
heads.

b00321ee-fc83-4550-b1d4-04def159ab89-0
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:50.835
And a couple of sea birds that
have been perched up on the

b00321ee-fc83-4550-b1d4-04def159ab89-1
01:48:50.835 --> 01:48:51.180
buoy.

c1589133-edc2-4da8-aa0d-b932fdc14cd2-0
01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.634
And the paper boats in the
foreground, kind of just moving

c1589133-edc2-4da8-aa0d-b932fdc14cd2-1
01:48:56.634 --> 01:49:00.190
away from the scene and now the
paper boat is on.

448bb1a3-9177-4ce6-8793-171bf7e5a5a1-0
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:05.889
In an area where there's a
lighthouse on an island, there's

448bb1a3-9177-4ce6-8793-171bf7e5a5a1-1
01:49:05.889 --> 01:49:10.863
a there's a person standing on
that island as well. In the

448bb1a3-9177-4ce6-8793-171bf7e5a5a1-2
01:49:10.863 --> 01:49:15.838
background we see steamships,
other kinds of ships in this

448bb1a3-9177-4ce6-8793-171bf7e5a5a1-3
01:49:15.838 --> 01:49:16.260
area.

dab6729d-0e8f-42ae-9cab-4605c04e68dd-0
01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.740
And some sea birds flying in the
air.

6dcc2e14-0e57-457d-a070-f40e557c7cec-0
01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:29.306
And then so it seems like we're
we're back in a a city Type

6dcc2e14-0e57-457d-a070-f40e557c7cec-1
01:49:29.306 --> 01:49:34.438
Harbor area. This is a you know
coming across like a a harbor

6dcc2e14-0e57-457d-a070-f40e557c7cec-2
01:49:34.438 --> 01:49:39.818
it's it's got like a a long pier
going out into the water with a

6dcc2e14-0e57-457d-a070-f40e557c7cec-3
01:49:39.818 --> 01:49:45.115
a giant structure at the top of
it that looks like it's used as

6dcc2e14-0e57-457d-a070-f40e557c7cec-4
01:49:45.115 --> 01:49:50.330
some kind of maybe open air like
amphitheater of some kind but

6dcc2e14-0e57-457d-a070-f40e557c7cec-5
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:50.910
it's um

c3dea5ef-d769-459b-89a9-8adf67139129-0
01:49:51.690 --> 01:49:54.817
It's it's got a a roof. It's
kind of like, it looks like a

c3dea5ef-d769-459b-89a9-8adf67139129-1
01:49:54.817 --> 01:49:55.400
Tabernacle.

b980ab4c-11d9-403a-985a-532ea034cbfa-0
01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.871
And below the paper boat
continues to float on the water

b980ab4c-11d9-403a-985a-532ea034cbfa-1
01:49:59.871 --> 01:50:03.272
and we see additional ships in
this harbor including a tall

b980ab4c-11d9-403a-985a-532ea034cbfa-2
01:50:03.272 --> 01:50:06.900
ship with many sails and that's
like kind of in the background.

f7c8ccad-dcf3-4480-b305-b5d7f071feae-0
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.610
Alright, so the.

86c72c45-717a-4cf3-a39f-2d0e41813d5e-0
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:17.920
The paper boat is like real
close to one of these.

40ca5fae-f3df-4661-b0d7-7839e160a05f-0
01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:22.333
Big ocean liners, and it's
coming on to its stern and we

40ca5fae-f3df-4661-b0d7-7839e160a05f-1
01:50:22.333 --> 01:50:26.071
have another boat, like a
tugboat type of a thing, that's

40ca5fae-f3df-4661-b0d7-7839e160a05f-2
01:50:26.071 --> 01:50:29.745
also on the scene and a very
small sailboat. And sort of

40ca5fae-f3df-4661-b0d7-7839e160a05f-3
01:50:29.745 --> 01:50:33.419
below the surface of the water
we can see that there's a

40ca5fae-f3df-4661-b0d7-7839e160a05f-4
01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:37.093
submarine below and in the
background we see a sort of a

40ca5fae-f3df-4661-b0d7-7839e160a05f-5
01:50:37.093 --> 01:50:38.060
city landscape.

a0602368-b8da-46c4-b298-21a9e1356934-0
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:47.520
OK, so here it looks as if.

ebe60a2c-8c63-45e0-8f9d-07d16ea4dbf6-0
01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:53.980
A giant whale with a mechanism
around its body that allows it

ebe60a2c-8c63-45e0-8f9d-07d16ea4dbf6-1
01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.880
to be out of the water.

43c1af94-ef70-459a-8aeb-33686c7a7b1f-0
01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:00.976
Has come up on the shore or is
trying to, so it's. It's using

43c1af94-ef70-459a-8aeb-33686c7a7b1f-1
01:51:00.976 --> 01:51:01.240
its.

70538e37-503f-4be3-b321-fd3774fce2f2-0
01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:06.045
Suit. It's like an air suit.
It's the opposite of like a

70538e37-503f-4be3-b321-fd3774fce2f2-1
01:51:06.045 --> 01:51:07.100
swimsuit for us.

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-0
01:51:07.890 --> 01:51:12.417
To come up on the shore, it's
got a device that keeps it wet,

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-1
01:51:12.417 --> 01:51:16.652
like a shower head that's
attached to the suit so that it

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-2
01:51:16.652 --> 01:51:21.107
showers water down on its head,
and it seems to want to come

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-3
01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:25.561
ashore. There's also a cherry
picker that's being used by at

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-4
01:51:25.561 --> 01:51:29.578
least one of these people to
hoist up somebody in this

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-5
01:51:29.578 --> 01:51:33.375
bucket, and it looks like maybe
the two of them are

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-6
01:51:33.375 --> 01:51:38.121
communicating. In the next scene
we just see the bows of some of

ab8d051b-86e4-478a-8434-774154740a6e-7
01:51:38.121 --> 01:51:38.560
these.

242e2644-3f93-4c65-a07d-eed5bccd4534-0
01:51:38.630 --> 01:51:43.590
Ocean liners with all of these
people standing on up on a wall.

036ce080-789b-490b-85bb-6f14831b8bd4-0
01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:48.800
Kind of all looking over towards
where the whale is.

303a9b2a-3613-4cf6-9d17-d488fc1ef2f5-0
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:59.953
So from here we're now like
fully into this Industrial

303a9b2a-3613-4cf6-9d17-d488fc1ef2f5-1
01:51:59.953 --> 01:52:01.410
Harbor area, the.

018f7f9f-dcab-47f9-b977-ff310ee34498-0
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:06.449
The, the boat, the paper boat
continues on the surface of the

018f7f9f-dcab-47f9-b977-ff310ee34498-1
01:52:06.449 --> 01:52:10.558
water, you know, so here we see
an industrial scene happening in

018f7f9f-dcab-47f9-b977-ff310ee34498-2
01:52:10.558 --> 01:52:13.845
the background with cranes
carrying, you know, like

018f7f9f-dcab-47f9-b977-ff310ee34498-3
01:52:13.845 --> 01:52:15.110
shipping containers.

cfa5d5d3-5410-41d1-9e2b-ff8981c0635b-0
01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:20.322
We've got additional boats and
then on the right we see this

cfa5d5d3-5410-41d1-9e2b-ff8981c0635b-1
01:52:20.322 --> 01:52:24.932
possibly this creature that had
been hoisted out of the water,

cfa5d5d3-5410-41d1-9e2b-ff8981c0635b-2
01:52:24.932 --> 01:52:28.810
although it does like it looks
mechanical, it looks.

0b7db78c-7896-4f7b-b3b0-a906a2c973b2-0
01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:35.334
It looks like a combination of
something that's both biological

0b7db78c-7896-4f7b-b3b0-a906a2c973b2-1
01:52:35.334 --> 01:52:39.778
and mechanical. It looks as if a
giant fish had been pulled out

0b7db78c-7896-4f7b-b3b0-a906a2c973b2-2
01:52:39.778 --> 01:52:44.153
of the water, but it's got like
attachments to it and it's got

0b7db78c-7896-4f7b-b3b0-a906a2c973b2-3
01:52:44.153 --> 01:52:48.666
somebody that's up on the top of
it looking through a glass orb.

0b7db78c-7896-4f7b-b3b0-a906a2c973b2-4
01:52:48.666 --> 01:52:51.999
So it's almost as if this is
like a sea vessel.

c7619045-5992-480d-9b79-692449a24b4e-0
01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:59.630
So here we have a.

fabe55d3-822d-47cf-85f6-cd6dd49f0dc1-0
01:53:01.170 --> 01:53:05.607
A fishing boat that's captured 2
sea creatures. They're the ones

fabe55d3-822d-47cf-85f6-cd6dd49f0dc1-1
01:53:05.607 --> 01:53:09.703
from before, the one that looks
like a narwhal and one that

fabe55d3-822d-47cf-85f6-cd6dd49f0dc1-2
01:53:09.703 --> 01:53:11.410
looks like a saw toothed.

f1782f9e-1c95-43e1-9405-839722b41706-0
01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:14.570
You know, one of those sharks.

ebac87ee-270d-4164-9db4-d304ef627d80-0
01:53:16.090 --> 01:53:20.280
So they've both been caught by a
giant fishing nut that's been

ebac87ee-270d-4164-9db4-d304ef627d80-1
01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:24.005
hoisted out of the water by a
crane on the back of this

ebac87ee-270d-4164-9db4-d304ef627d80-2
01:53:24.005 --> 01:53:24.870
fishing boat.

26e008eb-1f7d-4cad-8296-857c098f0c12-0
01:53:25.530 --> 01:53:30.865
The paper boat is just nearby on
the water and in the next scene

26e008eb-1f7d-4cad-8296-857c098f0c12-1
01:53:30.865 --> 01:53:31.440
we see.

0cafcf8d-b457-48d8-b8ca-22f98e14ea96-0
01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:36.760
Exploratio on the side of one of
these.

c7d706a6-f15e-4b46-b232-4734102832ef-0
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:41.764
Buildings slash boats. I think
it might. I think it might be a

c7d706a6-f15e-4b46-b232-4734102832ef-1
01:53:41.764 --> 01:53:44.540
boat, even though it looks like
a building.

b01cb652-8d55-48b7-a6f2-6c2311f746bf-0
01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:45.630
Umm.

42bf1f2b-6c1a-461e-a28a-07152b201798-0
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:50.981
And a couple of additional boats
in the same harbor as the paper

42bf1f2b-6c1a-461e-a28a-07152b201798-1
01:53:50.981 --> 01:53:54.798
boat and it has come to a part
of the harbor that has a

42bf1f2b-6c1a-461e-a28a-07152b201798-2
01:53:54.798 --> 01:53:59.093
stairway descending down into it
so that there's somebody very

42bf1f2b-6c1a-461e-a28a-07152b201798-3
01:53:59.093 --> 01:54:02.570
close nearby to where the boat,
the paper boat is.

fbbc671a-3b33-4578-be56-a3616ad73da1-0
01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:11.835
OK, so here's a bird's eye view
of the top of the city looking

fbbc671a-3b33-4578-be56-a3616ad73da1-1
01:54:11.835 --> 01:54:16.320
down at the river that's kind of
like cutting through the city.

fbbc671a-3b33-4578-be56-a3616ad73da1-2
01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:20.945
The paper boats on the river and
there's a couple of bridges that

fbbc671a-3b33-4578-be56-a3616ad73da1-3
01:54:20.945 --> 01:54:24.870
come over top the the river.
It's night time again the.

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-0
01:54:25.710 --> 01:54:30.004
The town is dark except for the
lights that tend to like light

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-1
01:54:30.004 --> 01:54:34.162
up some of the windows, and in
the foreground there are some

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-2
01:54:34.162 --> 01:54:38.593
kind of winged creature. I think
it's the same creature that was

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-3
01:54:38.593 --> 01:54:42.820
standing on the shore looking at
the drowning paper boat, and

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-4
01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.250
it's using its wings to jump off
of one of the taller structures

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-5
01:54:47.250 --> 01:54:51.545
in the area. But also attached
to it is propellers, so I think

94bf204f-2277-4867-a2d9-da23283a7edf-6
01:54:51.545 --> 01:54:55.840
it might be able to float down
pretty safely from where it is.

21e0804b-03e5-4747-89c8-089874e9af39-0
01:54:59.110 --> 01:55:03.140
So the nighttime scene continues
with some um.

57c47490-57e6-45b2-8874-ff0b908c8543-0
01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:07.794
Some scenes where lots of people
have walked down the stairs to

57c47490-57e6-45b2-8874-ff0b908c8543-1
01:55:07.794 --> 01:55:11.982
where the paper boat is, we see
the Nautilus shell that's been

57c47490-57e6-45b2-8874-ff0b908c8543-2
01:55:11.982 --> 01:55:15.438
pulled up and all of the
creatures that were on the

57c47490-57e6-45b2-8874-ff0b908c8543-3
01:55:15.438 --> 01:55:19.559
Nautilus shell the the horse,
the the deer creature, the Moon

57c47490-57e6-45b2-8874-ff0b908c8543-4
01:55:19.559 --> 01:55:22.950
knight on all of the other, like
the two children.

1647b211-6faa-452f-a21c-39a7551619a5-0
01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.470
And the.

6e130b63-c2f6-43d4-a7eb-b888298fa38e-0
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:30.630
Diving helmet creature are all
down there at this point, and

6e130b63-c2f6-43d4-a7eb-b888298fa38e-1
01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:35.089
they're all kind of like hanging
out in the next scene, including

6e130b63-c2f6-43d4-a7eb-b888298fa38e-2
01:55:35.089 --> 01:55:35.360
the.

11a17846-4d94-4d0a-8a3e-444e208b45ee-0
01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:42.506
A diving helmet guy, maybe he's
just a guy, you know, it looks

11a17846-4d94-4d0a-8a3e-444e208b45ee-1
01:55:42.506 --> 01:55:45.969
like in this next scene, his
helmets off and he's having a

11a17846-4d94-4d0a-8a3e-444e208b45ee-2
01:55:45.969 --> 01:55:49.607
cigarette and he's just kind of
hanging out with his seahorse

11a17846-4d94-4d0a-8a3e-444e208b45ee-3
01:55:49.607 --> 01:55:52.834
buddy. And the paper boat
continues to travel down the

11a17846-4d94-4d0a-8a3e-444e208b45ee-4
01:55:52.834 --> 01:55:55.710
river underneath the bridges
that are coming up.

43bd70a4-dcdf-42a2-a531-0c8bfcf2d4ab-0
01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:02.652
So the paper boat continues down
the river and um, sort of, we're

43bd70a4-dcdf-42a2-a531-0c8bfcf2d4ab-1
01:56:02.652 --> 01:56:06.653
exiting the town. So it's a lot
more quiet in this part of the

43bd70a4-dcdf-42a2-a531-0c8bfcf2d4ab-2
01:56:06.653 --> 01:56:10.655
town. Some fish are looking on
from the foreground, looking at

43bd70a4-dcdf-42a2-a531-0c8bfcf2d4ab-3
01:56:10.655 --> 01:56:13.450
the paper boat with it, their
glowing eyes.

22b6b64e-bcc7-41a9-9544-05e685b6c595-0
01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:19.028
And the paper boat continues to
travel down. There's like

22b6b64e-bcc7-41a9-9544-05e685b6c595-1
01:56:19.028 --> 01:56:23.058
abandoned tugboat nearby and
it's kind of like heading

22b6b64e-bcc7-41a9-9544-05e685b6c595-2
01:56:23.058 --> 01:56:24.450
towards some trees.

8ee3cb2a-0cee-4a9d-90ae-305ed95b4dea-0
01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:36.430
So it continues to head towards
a tree filled area on top of a.

dd0fe574-2798-44dc-a81b-5e15d4c397cd-0
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:42.620
On top of like this part of the
land, there's a.

04998c34-3ab3-418b-9abd-d4f9546889ac-0
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:48.217
A small house with a streetlight
illuminating the area around the

04998c34-3ab3-418b-9abd-d4f9546889ac-1
01:56:48.217 --> 01:56:52.315
house, and that's where the
tugboat's going. The boat pulls

04998c34-3ab3-418b-9abd-d4f9546889ac-2
01:56:52.315 --> 01:56:52.520
up.

b321721e-9fff-48a2-9d4e-da6deb65d517-0
01:56:54.230 --> 01:56:59.666
To the section of where this
particular piece of land is,

b321721e-9fff-48a2-9d4e-da6deb65d517-1
01:56:59.666 --> 01:57:05.478
there's a there's a place to
pull up your boat and hitch your

b321721e-9fff-48a2-9d4e-da6deb65d517-2
01:57:05.478 --> 01:57:09.040
boat to this this part here and
from.

ed4c84e3-159e-4e2e-948c-7bb1558e550b-0
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:14.278
At first it looks like it's just
the paper boat that's there, but

ed4c84e3-159e-4e2e-948c-7bb1558e550b-1
01:57:14.278 --> 01:57:18.116
then coming out of the paper
boat looks like there's like

ed4c84e3-159e-4e2e-948c-7bb1558e550b-2
01:57:18.116 --> 01:57:21.360
this this person, and they
become more and more.

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-0
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:26.102
Opaque like they were very kind
of translucent in the first

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-1
01:57:26.102 --> 01:57:29.890
scene, and then as they become
more opaque, the paper boat

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-2
01:57:29.890 --> 01:57:33.293
begins to become more
transparent, like the boat, it

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-3
01:57:33.293 --> 01:57:36.953
disappears as this person
creature that has all sorts of

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-4
01:57:36.953 --> 01:57:40.934
black and white markings all
over it becomes more present and

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-5
01:57:40.934 --> 01:57:44.979
the person begins to walk up the
stairs to where the house was

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-6
01:57:44.979 --> 01:57:49.024
and it looks like we can only
see the next scene from like the

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-7
01:57:49.024 --> 01:57:53.005
shins down, but it looks like
they've just met somebody else.

1226076d-775d-48c0-8c5f-620f8d0bf809-8
01:57:53.005 --> 01:57:53.840
#END_wanderer

06ee85a5-87e1-47ef-8bf3-19e83561b9e5-0
01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:03.680
Thank you so.

668caa25-1d13-4676-af96-f4b894e8e1d9-0
01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:07.640
That's all the time we have
today.

e07ed5c3-a94f-4af4-a14a-74e6c22c05b6-0
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:15.393
So I think at the the next one
we'll be able to finish the rest

e07ed5c3-a94f-4af4-a14a-74e6c22c05b6-1
01:58:15.393 --> 01:58:19.320
of what we have is there. Oh
wait, let me.
