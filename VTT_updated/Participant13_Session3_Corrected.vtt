00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.830
{Here you go.}

692e43da-5ef4-4ea4-a3c2-efe73e14534c-0
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.962
{Um, so this this book is around
5 pages, or this chapter of the

692e43da-5ef4-4ea4-a3c2-efe73e14534c-1
00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:12.394
book is around 5 pages, and
we're aiming for between 10 and

692e43da-5ef4-4ea4-a3c2-efe73e14534c-2
00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:15.350
15 minutes as you described the
story.}

606ffc0b-9068-4f20-943c-84846b2150f8-0
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.445
#START_arrival_1 This a person
is retrieving a photograph of

606ffc0b-9068-4f20-943c-84846b2150f8-1
00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.360
three people from what looks
like a mantlepiece. 

c0384502-90c2-453c-b1dc-38373a4d7c8e-0
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.031
Is putting it, packaging it and
preparing it, apparently to send

c0384502-90c2-453c-b1dc-38373a4d7c8e-1
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:45.595
with a string around it, and
putting it into a drawer or a

c0384502-90c2-453c-b1dc-38373a4d7c8e-2
00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:46.930
place where.

c8670b84-0f72-43bb-a3d9-516089e0ad40-0
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.830
It is safe. Maybe it's a
briefcase, maybe no.

eeb8d20f-b6ce-4179-b2c9-1aec6083ff4d-0
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.970
Hard to say what that is anyway,
and now is.

1824cb20-6077-4ae5-8564-2d23ba94decb-0
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.650
Has closed their hands. Looks
like a man's hands over it.

9f3abd00-6f29-42c0-840f-1dca131f5048-0
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.110
Ah, it's a suitcase. You put
this package.

201130a3-e6af-433a-b58a-f97fa37b2663-0
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.689
This wrapped photograph into a
suitcase and is going to send it

201130a3-e6af-433a-b58a-f97fa37b2663-1
00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.040
somewhere he and his wife looks
like are at the kitchen table.

55506d2a-0c33-4111-b026-0283e04dc1fc-0
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.920
And there are some.

e33c4532-dea5-4fe3-b625-98da00e4add8-0
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.724
Fragments of what? Uh, things
that are in their room. There's

e33c4532-dea5-4fe3-b625-98da00e4add8-1
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.960
a clock on the mantelpiece.

f03c377b-6aff-4d94-b3e9-4d45ff451d3c-0
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.727
And there is an origami bird.
Somebody has folded the paper,

f03c377b-6aff-4d94-b3e9-4d45ff451d3c-1
00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:55.004
the hat that is hanging on its
hook, and a towel. There is a

f03c377b-6aff-4d94-b3e9-4d45ff451d3c-2
00:01:55.004 --> 00:02:00.664
pot with a spoon. There's a
drawing done by a child, a

f03c377b-6aff-4d94-b3e9-4d45ff451d3c-3
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.339
teapot with a crack in it.

1f27d485-0f91-43c0-aa87-b9b462a425b9-0
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.793
See a cup of coffee and maybe
some dollar bills or some kind

1f27d485-0f91-43c0-aa87-b9b462a425b9-1
00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:16.073
of money and the suitcase. So
this is a these are the

1f27d485-0f91-43c0-aa87-b9b462a425b9-2
00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:21.743
fragments of the total picture
of this a man, woman and a

1f27d485-0f91-43c0-aa87-b9b462a425b9-3
00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:22.330
child.

9bf1cfd4-6a72-4333-878c-4d47322d3a4c-0
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.400
And they've left the house, all
three of them.

4c8ebc38-2a1f-4dac-8ccd-91959be759b6-0
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.593
And the little girl was
apparently asleep and has gotten

4c8ebc38-2a1f-4dac-8ccd-91959be759b6-1
00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:41.577
up and has had some tea or
something that she's stirring

4c8ebc38-2a1f-4dac-8ccd-91959be759b6-2
00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:46.473
with a spoon. The suitcases
there, there's some kind of

4c8ebc38-2a1f-4dac-8ccd-91959be759b6-3
00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:51.894
sadness, it seems. It looks as
if the man is leaving with the

4c8ebc38-2a1f-4dac-8ccd-91959be759b6-4
00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:54.080
suitcase and the wife is.

3e6ed312-004d-4065-b5bb-4c4f718c05bb-0
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.835
Bearing up and the little girl
is putting on her boots and her

3e6ed312-004d-4065-b5bb-4c4f718c05bb-1
00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:03.670
hat and they're all leaving the
house. It's hard to say if

3e6ed312-004d-4065-b5bb-4c4f718c05bb-2
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.180
they're all leaving, apparently
all leaving together.

fc1eacbd-ba7a-453f-a517-2e8f41527714-0
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.572
In the suitcase and there is
some kind of a Dragon's tale

fc1eacbd-ba7a-453f-a517-2e8f41527714-1
00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:18.896
that you see on the outside of
the house as they have left are

fc1eacbd-ba7a-453f-a517-2e8f41527714-2
00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.080
in the street.

44640ecf-3280-4a67-8168-bd6710a9636c-0
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.571
We're at the train station,
yeah, and the little girl is

44640ecf-3280-4a67-8168-bd6710a9636c-1
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:34.410
kind of in wonderment about
what's going on.

8516f29c-be7a-4d87-a805-08c8e6f9a4bf-0
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.722
And the train is coming into the
station, and the little, the man

8516f29c-be7a-4d87-a805-08c8e6f9a4bf-1
00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:48.343
is saying goodbye to the little
girl as he takes off his hat. He

8516f29c-be7a-4d87-a805-08c8e6f9a4bf-2
00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:52.467
has folded his this bird, this
paper bird for her, and is

8516f29c-be7a-4d87-a805-08c8e6f9a4bf-3
00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:55.240
giving it to her because he's
leaving.

fccc8866-84a1-4dae-a15e-6ddc066aabed-0
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.390
And the wife is very upset that
he is leaving.

817f33fc-ecd9-47d9-b21c-0837e2baf329-0
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.758
And he says goodbye and takes
the suitcase with him, and they

817f33fc-ecd9-47d9-b21c-0837e2baf329-1
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:10.067
all hold each other's hands as
he's leaving. And the train

817f33fc-ecd9-47d9-b21c-0837e2baf329-2
00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:14.230
pulls out of the station and
disappears into the sunset.

71f3a17b-7335-4591-9e5a-11f1477f6e54-0
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.870
Or sunrise.

09bf9578-e951-4fc8-8bf2-a40a8a442129-0
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.425
And here he has apparently
arrived somewhere and has taken

09bf9578-e951-4fc8-8bf2-a40a8a442129-1
00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:30.062
out the photograph of the family
immediately and having a couple

09bf9578-e951-4fc8-8bf2-a40a8a442129-2
00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:32.490
of soup or something to eat.

83b099d6-9b47-4858-b479-e3dad35430fa-0
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.140
Sharing out the photograph and.

e3742324-af82-4594-bb18-449b002728c8-0
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.280
Thinking about his family.

b63a8f84-15c0-4e50-92d6-a0fe9c25e674-0
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.700
And uh.

f1d9fb6a-e348-4aa8-8b64-82b4dfe43d83-0
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.315
Be aware that he is in a
stateroom on an ocean liner, so

f1d9fb6a-e348-4aa8-8b64-82b4dfe43d83-1
00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:50.810
he's going quite a distance
away. #END_arrival_1

bcc5bf26-672d-40a6-ac25-b508004e0ce9-0
00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.050
{OK. So that was that part of
the story and we're going to.}

ad43a018-454d-40af-b494-1d40c2783180-0
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.872

is around 8 pages, again aiming

for 10 to 15 minutes.}

e7de0996-3a0a-4bde-8c65-f30945dca3e7-0
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.957
#START_arrival_4 OK, this is
looks like our man and he is on

e7de0996-3a0a-4bde-8c65-f30945dca3e7-1

his the.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.030
Sojourn wherever that is.

937eac7d-7c66-4b4a-ba0d-642fd699fcb6-0
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.580
He is in a.

6313c65f-c987-484f-a127-da97a5bfc73b-0
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.620
He is in a city.

77c4a6b9-9ee5-442b-b386-0db1eb763682-0
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.799
He is getting up and preparing
to go out, getting dressed,

77c4a6b9-9ee5-442b-b386-0db1eb763682-1
00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:47.427
getting his hat and taking a map
of the city where he's going.

77c4a6b9-9ee5-442b-b386-0db1eb763682-2
00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:52.786
And here's our creature again,
our mouse, elephant, dolphin

77c4a6b9-9ee5-442b-b386-0db1eb763682-3
00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:58.324
with legs. Creature who is going
to is, is I think, good luck

77c4a6b9-9ee5-442b-b386-0db1eb763682-4
00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:58.860
charm.

d49ea89c-19cd-4a4f-bb03-d5be7b75ff6d-0
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.750
Yeah, uh.

f8a11824-4c66-4c00-a9c4-00a9f2a3facb-0
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.352
I think it's probably an
imaginary creature, but it is

f8a11824-4c66-4c00-a9c4-00a9f2a3facb-1
00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:13.549
watching over him and he is
walking along highway but

f8a11824-4c66-4c00-a9c4-00a9f2a3facb-2
00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:19.322
appears to be in a very large
city, looks rather forbidding

f8a11824-4c66-4c00-a9c4-00a9f2a3facb-3
00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:25.000
and he is insulting his map and
is in the what looks to be

f8a11824-4c66-4c00-a9c4-00a9f2a3facb-4
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.485
there's a bridge and a boat
going under it, but no water

f8a11824-4c66-4c00-a9c4-00a9f2a3facb-5
00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:33.180
necessarily, a bunch of tea.

a3709ebb-b00e-48df-91cb-8f2a05689a19-0
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.457
Trees or buildings that are
constructed like teepees and a

a3709ebb-b00e-48df-91cb-8f2a05689a19-1
00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:42.153
lot of people including animals,
and they appear to be in an area

a3709ebb-b00e-48df-91cb-8f2a05689a19-2
00:06:42.153 --> 00:06:46.777
that they are waiting. Probably
looks as if there's some kind of

a3709ebb-b00e-48df-91cb-8f2a05689a19-3
00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:49.410
a train might be coming by for
them.

189abf74-c301-495e-afd8-7fbf8a131af8-0
00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:02.048
Ohh they imaginary has met a
friend and they are confabbing

189abf74-c301-495e-afd8-7fbf8a131af8-1
00:07:02.048 --> 00:07:08.805
and the man sees a woman there
and they're comparing notes on

189abf74-c301-495e-afd8-7fbf8a131af8-2
00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:15.671
maps and creatures and maybe she
is a native of this place and

189abf74-c301-495e-afd8-7fbf8a131af8-3
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:21.120
he's asking her for information.
She shows him a.

2757b4e1-ae7b-451c-becc-558a370432ee-0
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.426
Telephone and how to use that.
What looks like a telephone.

2757b4e1-ae7b-451c-becc-558a370432ee-1
00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:30.410
There's a earpiece and there is
a dial thing.

a74a1e01-7372-4d5c-9f24-e536d786aaf0-0
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.790
And uh.

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-0
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.543
Some kind of a a gear that ohh
she's getting a ticket. This is

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-1
00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:44.095
a ticket machine and she's
showing him the ticket that he

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-2
00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:48.882
needs to get where he wants to
go. So he has had help from a

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-3
00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:53.512
native and everyone is bidding
farewell to a some of these

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-4
00:07:53.512 --> 00:07:58.063
boats. They're up there in the
atmosphere. They look like

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-5
00:07:58.063 --> 00:08:02.772
boats, but they're probably
planes. In any case, they're in

05454218-c53b-4f9c-b724-dd84e4c55038-6
00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:04.420
some kind of a murky.

eb040366-80e7-4a63-a6b5-6fcd2f8f9cf0-0
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.478
Atmosphere and flying around
there with people in them,

eb040366-80e7-4a63-a6b5-6fcd2f8f9cf0-1
00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:14.270
mostly people, and they appear
to have a smokestack in them.

c31d1a78-8d21-4809-90d7-2bf62e7fcb86-0
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:21.707
Kind of odd, but anyway, that's
maybe how they're powered and

c31d1a78-8d21-4809-90d7-2bf62e7fcb86-1
00:08:21.707 --> 00:08:23.780
people down are down below.

03dc94e7-3f92-4a19-bce8-de3c50a72fb1-0
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.953
Waiting. So apparently to get
around in this atmosphere, you

03dc94e7-3f92-4a19-bce8-de3c50a72fb1-1
00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:38.929
take these flying machines and
here he is getting on to one of

03dc94e7-3f92-4a19-bce8-de3c50a72fb1-2
00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:43.690
them with his creature and
somebody is is.

6dae4aab-e973-45f3-b862-99ad8af013dd-0
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.268
Punching his ticket so that he
can travel. This person who is

6dae4aab-e973-45f3-b862-99ad8af013dd-1
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:55.136
doing that is looking like a
prison guard, for heaven's sake,

6dae4aab-e973-45f3-b862-99ad8af013dd-2
00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.550
out of forbidding.

0cc56fdc-455e-484c-81d4-7084b507e771-0
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.982
And he has this creature with
him, so he's well aware of that

0cc56fdc-455e-484c-81d4-7084b507e771-1
00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:14.515
creature, even though I don't
know how how real it is when he

0cc56fdc-455e-484c-81d4-7084b507e771-2
00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:19.779
gets on the sitting down. This
looks more like a boat, the

0cc56fdc-455e-484c-81d4-7084b507e771-3
00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:24.419
carrier of this rig that he's
traveling on. And he.

66d1e20f-61a1-4588-bb4d-92342944da06-0
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.868
Strikes up a conversation with a
woman and asks her about.

66d1e20f-61a1-4588-bb4d-92342944da06-1
00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:33.830
Apparently he is looking for
someone.

07a32a0e-c85f-4c5d-b92b-2f7b46c1468d-0
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.322
Oh no, he isn't looking for
someone. This is his identity

07a32a0e-c85f-4c5d-b92b-2f7b46c1468d-1
00:09:39.322 --> 00:09:43.490
papers that he's showing to her,
and she's showing him hers.

ee9c9b59-57d7-483e-a938-7f2ea60e7e29-0
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.531
Person that she's showing looks
does not look like her. Maybe

ee9c9b59-57d7-483e-a938-7f2ea60e7e29-1
00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:53.520
these are people looking for for
other people.

e7cfef03-62c1-486d-a5b3-f8905708727c-0
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.480
Now.

1cf7134c-5bc2-4e53-b13b-c2a0a7caadc0-0
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.955
Ah, she's showing this woman
that he has met is has taken out

1cf7134c-5bc2-4e53-b13b-c2a0a7caadc0-1
00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:09.147
a photograph of somebody who
apparently she is looking for.

1cf7134c-5bc2-4e53-b13b-c2a0a7caadc0-2
00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:14.772
That person has was at one time
reading a book, then was someone

1cf7134c-5bc2-4e53-b13b-c2a0a7caadc0-3
00:10:14.772 --> 00:10:19.705
has confiscated that book and
taken it away from her and

1cf7134c-5bc2-4e53-b13b-c2a0a7caadc0-4
00:10:19.705 --> 00:10:20.829
locked it up.

3abfe76f-d666-4ceb-b754-198ad48db17f-0
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.929
Oh boy shades of the South that
don't want anybody to read

3abfe76f-d666-4ceb-b754-198ad48db17f-1
00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:26.590
anything.

e059b473-764d-40bc-ade4-cee0ca366797-0
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.380
And lock that up and taken that
girl and given her a spade and

e059b473-764d-40bc-ade4-cee0ca366797-1
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:42.642
directed her to shovel down in
some catacomb and she is there

e059b473-764d-40bc-ade4-cee0ca366797-2
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:49.905
with no shoes on and some kind
of just a dress that she looks

e059b473-764d-40bc-ade4-cee0ca366797-3
00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:51.779
like a prisoner.

b2d75d3a-7cae-4040-ae11-69b573bc7840-0
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.555
And she is stocking a fire,
maybe shoveling coal into a

b2d75d3a-7cae-4040-ae11-69b573bc7840-1
00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:04.355
fire, possibly to keep warm, and
she is now climbing the ladder

b2d75d3a-7cae-4040-ae11-69b573bc7840-2
00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:10.246
on this furnace and has reached
the top of the furnace. She must

b2d75d3a-7cae-4040-ae11-69b573bc7840-3
00:11:10.246 --> 00:11:12.149
be trying to get out.

86223a18-79e6-4d85-b95e-6779916e7fa0-0
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.210
Ah, she's up on the top of the
furnace trying to see what's

86223a18-79e6-4d85-b95e-6779916e7fa0-1
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.531
going on. And there are many
other of these cubicles with the

86223a18-79e6-4d85-b95e-6779916e7fa0-2
00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:30.450
smokestacks, and it looks like
a.

682feb23-26f4-4411-9739-e7a1bf34ada8-0
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.776
Tramway something where some
something is traveling or would

682feb23-26f4-4411-9739-e7a1bf34ada8-1
00:11:36.776 --> 00:11:42.835
be traveling if it could. There
are lights outside so this is in

682feb23-26f4-4411-9739-e7a1bf34ada8-2
00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.420
an enclosed area.

e5eccc56-3e1e-4339-ad0b-b34ff1b95e20-0
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.117
And she is trying to see what's
going on. There are people in

e5eccc56-3e1e-4339-ad0b-b34ff1b95e20-1
00:11:54.117 --> 00:11:58.543
these other cubicles that look
like hers. They are all stocking

e5eccc56-3e1e-4339-ad0b-b34ff1b95e20-2
00:11:58.543 --> 00:12:03.108
fires, and they all appear to be
young women wearing a gunny sack

e5eccc56-3e1e-4339-ad0b-b34ff1b95e20-3
00:12:03.108 --> 00:12:07.465
and shoes. So they are clearly
not intended to get out of this

e5eccc56-3e1e-4339-ad0b-b34ff1b95e20-4
00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:07.880
place.

723c6969-08cf-436b-aada-8460bdf99682-0
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:14.387
So she is uh, decided that she
is in a bad situation and she

723c6969-08cf-436b-aada-8460bdf99682-1
00:12:14.387 --> 00:12:19.837
has a door there though and she
tries to open the door and was

723c6969-08cf-436b-aada-8460bdf99682-2
00:12:19.837 --> 00:12:20.529
looking.

4d4de9d8-4f77-4f28-98c7-341ab9c37da5-0
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.069
Is it? She's gotten that door
open and is looking in the

4d4de9d8-4f77-4f28-98c7-341ab9c37da5-1
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:31.943
drawer where the book was that
she had was put, although I

4d4de9d8-4f77-4f28-98c7-341ab9c37da5-2
00:12:31.943 --> 00:12:37.065
don't know how she got it open
because it hadn't been locked,

4d4de9d8-4f77-4f28-98c7-341ab9c37da5-3
00:12:37.065 --> 00:12:40.040
and now she she has found the
book.

b7c0bc4d-cd9b-4e73-b846-37ac144a6083-0
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:46.227
And she is trying to get away
with it. She's climbing out of

b7c0bc4d-cd9b-4e73-b846-37ac144a6083-1
00:12:46.227 --> 00:12:51.360
what appears to be an opening in
the wall of her cubicle.

161b492a-b30c-443c-bdcf-51eedd2fff4f-0
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.480
There are.

813f76b3-7919-4adc-ac2a-eff0baeeac03-0
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.365
Maybe a little trains or
something, that something she

813f76b3-7919-4adc-ac2a-eff0baeeac03-1
00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:03.060
could get in she could escape
into.

efc213da-b5a7-4211-92ca-1d2ae2c776d3-0
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:11.804
Yeah, there it is. It's a the
boxcar and a train coming a hobo

efc213da-b5a7-4211-92ca-1d2ae2c776d3-1
00:13:11.804 --> 00:13:13.250
with her book.

f1e665a8-1a3e-497f-8a46-519e2aab278f-0
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.539
Now we have one of these
amphibious boats, the plains

f1e665a8-1a3e-497f-8a46-519e2aab278f-1
00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:32.718
with the smokestacks and also
what looks like maybe a squeal

f1e665a8-1a3e-497f-8a46-519e2aab278f-2
00:13:32.718 --> 00:13:34.440
like a steamship.

e0c25795-056b-4ffc-8154-6a93eecab21b-0
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.750
Uh, going through the atmosphere
in this city?

94c64df4-2cbf-44ed-8c87-ab4bf2198a1f-0
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:46.593
And here is the man with the
woman in one of them. He's A and

94c64df4-2cbf-44ed-8c87-ab4bf2198a1f-1
00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:50.080
she has the friend who his
creature.

ed1b25b7-dbbc-437b-8ceb-7658adfc984a-0
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.766
So maybe everybody has one of
these creatures. I don't know.

ed1b25b7-dbbc-437b-8ceb-7658adfc984a-1
00:13:56.766 --> 00:13:58.960
And then here is the guard.

394a2004-9aa1-4ff3-8fd8-41c2875c39c6-0
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:07.501
Conductor person who is in
charge of the boat or the flying

394a2004-9aa1-4ff3-8fd8-41c2875c39c6-1
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:08.370
machine?

ea366814-7913-4678-8e35-634ef14bb980-0
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.649
With the megaphone telling the
people on the boat probably that

ea366814-7913-4678-8e35-634ef14bb980-1
00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:18.930
this is their stop or whatever
it may be that they need to get

ea366814-7913-4678-8e35-634ef14bb980-2
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.212
on or off like a bus stop, and
he shakes hands with this woman

ea366814-7913-4678-8e35-634ef14bb980-3
00:14:23.212 --> 00:14:26.610
and she bids him farewell and he
leaves with his.

92714679-adc4-4677-9f85-c3d4998c45e6-0
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.476
Creature and looking around
trying to see what he had, where

92714679-adc4-4677-9f85-c3d4998c45e6-1
00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:38.080
he is, and now he's coming down
the stairs of from this.

124a190d-5e55-4c21-8030-c6d4a91232b7-0
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.540
In this city, and he can see in
the distance what looks to be

124a190d-5e55-4c21-8030-c6d4a91232b7-1
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.870
some kind of edifice that is
shaped like a.

383fb2c8-44af-4c51-9161-3516e42c7f0b-0
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.880
That sucks.

1325fcf6-93df-4acb-b6a0-b39de078f129-0
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.410
Looks like a benevolent rat, but
nevertheless a rat.

98f59834-cc58-457a-b440-292ecb294bb0-0
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:06.060
Other creatures and sunrises and
buildings and teepees and

98f59834-cc58-457a-b440-292ecb294bb0-1
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.640
various shapes.

2d1ff8ab-cc26-42de-b8e5-f824c109c4b4-0
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.187
Appears to be all done in stone.
Other people who are descending

2d1ff8ab-cc26-42de-b8e5-f824c109c4b4-1
00:15:14.187 --> 00:15:19.087
in these staircases that
apparently you're going to get

2d1ff8ab-cc26-42de-b8e5-f824c109c4b4-2
00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:22.500
around on foot in this maze of a
city.

bc0b9de2-a967-447c-8dc1-b44bb1b1f6fa-0
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.904
And he is with his creature and
on a plaza where there are a

bc0b9de2-a967-447c-8dc1-b44bb1b1f6fa-1
00:15:33.904 --> 00:15:35.840
number of buildings.

e57eb34f-0c0c-453b-8d96-d59c9fec360f-0
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:43.695
And we have people talking with
boxes of what looked to be

e57eb34f-0c0c-453b-8d96-d59c9fec360f-1
00:15:43.695 --> 00:15:44.420
octopi.

da03f149-e19d-42b5-818b-276039fefd35-0
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.480
Umm.

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-0
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.541
Hard to tell whether they're
alive or dead, what they are,

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-1
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:57.071
whether they are something or
building these people. Because

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-2
00:15:57.071 --> 00:16:01.230
if they're constrained
construction and somehow they're

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-3
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.834
wearing hats there may be are
protective and here is somebody

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-4
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:10.736
a woman and uh getting but maybe
a ticket and another with a with

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-5
00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:14.672
a fish. Maybe this is a
marketplace and people going

866bb657-ee71-47a4-b838-cb5edda48147-6
00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:16.900
back and forth and looking at.

158c8dcd-1d92-4777-bf61-040093df9397-0
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:18.540
Uh.

1cd091a5-18a8-4ea6-ab3b-b93aa379e11f-0
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.270
Fish and.

f08fd898-2b60-4cc6-bb1c-ae1df62438b7-0
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:30.012
Ah, here's the little creature
has found a drawer with other

f08fd898-2b60-4cc6-bb1c-ae1df62438b7-1
00:16:30.012 --> 00:16:33.450
little creatures in it, and the
man is.

25916b94-5cc1-4532-9f9a-eb59cc36c3ae-0
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.827
Watching it and looking in his
book to see what he might find

25916b94-5cc1-4532-9f9a-eb59cc36c3ae-1
00:16:40.827 --> 00:16:41.210
out.

04a00cae-22c3-413a-873e-b766c3cea5b0-0
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.360
Taking one of these, baby.

9fa86848-1f4f-40df-9bd4-a5041c23ec0b-0
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.730
It's hard to tell what it is.

c9591c86-4d0c-49f7-80fa-e453e98f58c1-0
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.970
Uh.

f0a3fdbf-d7ee-449f-aa12-a48e95607259-0
00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:02.380
Taking it out of the drawer and
the boy there, he wants to.

7b9878e4-4f2d-481f-8c36-ece09e600545-0
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.038
With a man, and he's offering it
to this man, and the man is

7b9878e4-4f2d-481f-8c36-ece09e600545-1
00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:12.684
pointing to something different
that he wants. It looks like a

7b9878e4-4f2d-481f-8c36-ece09e600545-2
00:17:12.684 --> 00:17:16.740
chair. And the terror of telling
him about this chair.

2efadb3a-fa47-4035-aa77-6d91b318c1c6-0
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.420
And the man who has offered him
the little creature is looking

2efadb3a-fa47-4035-aa77-6d91b318c1c6-1
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.750
into another box and finds a.

81fed4ef-19d4-4421-8156-14ff4e266018-0
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.590
What is that?

d0831c0e-d5d7-4c7d-937f-8e9bdd28ace3-0
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.130
Ah, it's.

2f8213db-f384-4b26-82d9-de961fca5946-0
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.189
Hard to tell. It looks like
another creature, a different

2f8213db-f384-4b26-82d9-de961fca5946-1
00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:42.900
kind of creature, and.

bbd566de-d8d1-4eda-9908-b23ae91238b5-0
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.343
The man has taken this creature
and is is doing something that

bbd566de-d8d1-4eda-9908-b23ae91238b5-1
00:17:48.343 --> 00:17:50.540
he looks as if he's sniffing it.

6b1178e0-32d1-4864-9763-619aa102e83b-0
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.763
And then the boy comes with a
dish. It looks as if they're

6b1178e0-32d1-4864-9763-619aa102e83b-1
00:17:57.763 --> 00:18:03.416
going to cook this creature for
some reason and and is telling

6b1178e0-32d1-4864-9763-619aa102e83b-2
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:08.890
him a story about it, and he
appears to be buying the story.

d149c9d6-1ab9-4558-8dd9-46ea7b8825ab-0
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.820
OK, here's a man.

98255785-95d1-430b-b324-65fe1bf5f896-0
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.642
Oh, this now turns into it's
maybe it's not a creature at

98255785-95d1-430b-b324-65fe1bf5f896-1
00:18:22.642 --> 00:18:25.390
all. Well, it it looks like a
shrimp.

19ba10cc-6990-4502-9567-b9451fd2e579-0
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:33.402
Boy has it and it looks like a
some kind of a horn and the man

19ba10cc-6990-4502-9567-b9451fd2e579-1
00:18:33.402 --> 00:18:34.850
is tasting it.

330c12be-79a5-4263-b778-0e59c13dc43e-0
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.759
Looks like these are the ones
who are trying to get this to

330c12be-79a5-4263-b778-0e59c13dc43e-1
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:40.770
the man with a hat.

06767c32-b7d4-4e4e-a910-388c4b143918-0
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.770
And then the boy brings in
another something that looks

06767c32-b7d4-4e4e-a910-388c4b143918-1
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.866
somewhat like an artichoke, and
it seems to be opening a shell

06767c32-b7d4-4e4e-a910-388c4b143918-2
00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:55.750
to see what's in it. Now it has
become a snake.

32c310c5-62c1-4b4c-ba8e-0610744df5e7-0
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:04.623
And he is cut that in pieces and
the boy is showing is going to

32c310c5-62c1-4b4c-ba8e-0610744df5e7-1
00:19:04.623 --> 00:19:11.576
eat it. Apparently the artichoke
is diminished in size as the man

32c310c5-62c1-4b4c-ba8e-0610744df5e7-2
00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:15.369
who was traveling is looking at
it.

6c58c538-6de5-4b9a-8fb9-c5574db78234-0
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.600
And boy is trying to feed it to
the creature.

4916830e-ce30-4a4e-adfb-17ff5ca1fa8f-0
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.890
And they've got a. Now they've
got a a.

f9f1b872-3b2e-4085-ae35-97a6e23c29ea-0
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:32.296
The basket with all of these
assorted pieces. They look like

f9f1b872-3b2e-4085-ae35-97a6e23c29ea-1
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:38.556
vegetables, maybe, but they've
been cutting up or discussing or

f9f1b872-3b2e-4085-ae35-97a6e23c29ea-2
00:19:38.556 --> 00:19:43.740
describing boy whispers to his
father something and.

6f1d1a62-534b-429c-9b4d-a3386df0a508-0
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.814
Here's another little boy with a
hat on, dressed like the other

6f1d1a62-534b-429c-9b4d-a3386df0a508-1
00:19:52.814 --> 00:19:59.168
man. Now here's the boy with the
whole basket full of food and

6f1d1a62-534b-429c-9b4d-a3386df0a508-2
00:19:59.168 --> 00:20:05.320
they're walking together. And we
are on a sandy floor with a

6f1d1a62-534b-429c-9b4d-a3386df0a508-3
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.960
bunch of boats ready that are
tethered there.

9c31fa04-57b5-4f7b-9d20-4c32818b2d3d-0
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.243
Waiting for the water to come
apparently, and the city now is

9c31fa04-57b5-4f7b-9d20-4c32818b2d3d-1
00:20:15.243 --> 00:20:16.330
in the background.

8a37b701-4925-4d3f-ba47-0af767a6cd9d-0
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.540
Has some.

20a344bb-0a98-4833-84af-e4b6ff7d0b91-0
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:24.280
The shapes are all very much the
same, sort of like snails.

83ea202a-875d-4e25-a2a8-175c45c84434-0
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.290
P's and.

e89425c4-be04-4a78-aa9e-cfc241946335-0
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.000
Curly Hugh, it's not nothing
very square.

f7dcc3e8-467d-4bdd-974a-4b76292fc6c4-0
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.363
The clouds are in the distance
and there appear to be more of

f7dcc3e8-467d-4bdd-974a-4b76292fc6c4-1
00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:38.740
these.

e2cf7c0a-3a76-4f6d-adc8-50105be6634b-0
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.554
Uh, flying objects that are
transporting people. We're on

e2cf7c0a-3a76-4f6d-adc8-50105be6634b-1
00:20:45.554 --> 00:20:50.729
the ground now, and the the
little, the creature is there

e2cf7c0a-3a76-4f6d-adc8-50105be6634b-2
00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:55.815
still. And here we are walking
along the ground with the

e2cf7c0a-3a76-4f6d-adc8-50105be6634b-3
00:20:55.815 --> 00:21:00.990
creature, and the little boy
finds a pot, and in that pot

e2cf7c0a-3a76-4f6d-adc8-50105be6634b-4
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.470
there is a little dragon or
other and.

0b544edb-444b-4891-aee8-2dcce50a4ae6-0
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.210
The man is afraid of it.

cacdb02d-a3d9-4cba-8c11-f186c603c5bf-0
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.273
And the other man who was trying
to sell him these things or has

cacdb02d-a3d9-4cba-8c11-f186c603c5bf-1
00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:19.163
been showing him these things,
he isn't necessarily selling

cacdb02d-a3d9-4cba-8c11-f186c603c5bf-2
00:21:19.163 --> 00:21:23.053
him, he's just describing to him
what these things are, the

cacdb02d-a3d9-4cba-8c11-f186c603c5bf-3
00:21:23.053 --> 00:21:26.100
vegetables and the the creatures
and the fish.

4ef0d8b6-e47d-4ff8-9f31-c78ddc52c3f9-0
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.121
And he tells him not to be
afraid and they examine it more

4ef0d8b6-e47d-4ff8-9f31-c78ddc52c3f9-1
00:21:33.121 --> 00:21:38.898
closely and it looks and it
turns out to be what appears to

4ef0d8b6-e47d-4ff8-9f31-c78ddc52c3f9-2
00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:44.580
be a cat with the Dragons tail.
Looks like a friendly cat.

f9b3e679-a1c7-4a18-b06d-26744f1623cf-0
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.680
The little boy is holding it and
the man is patting it now.

15ad9859-0593-4245-812e-d666f89a6cb0-0
00:21:53.630 --> 00:22:00.565
The man who is without the hat
is pointing to other creatures,

15ad9859-0593-4245-812e-d666f89a6cb0-1
00:22:00.565 --> 00:22:06.290
and the cat is looking at the
little creature, the.

d36da48e-816d-4f8b-9525-83be22e09573-0
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:13.347
The Guardian Angel of the man
with the hat and two of them,

d36da48e-816d-4f8b-9525-83be22e09573-1
00:22:13.347 --> 00:22:19.254
the the cat and the the Dragon
cat and the mouse are look as if

d36da48e-816d-4f8b-9525-83be22e09573-2
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:25.161
they're going to play together
and then they they're picking up

d36da48e-816d-4f8b-9525-83be22e09573-3
00:22:25.161 --> 00:22:27.099
the pieces from this.

735e921e-6f48-4dd0-b916-330eb8f0c34f-0
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.510
Basket.

8cb4a6af-5212-424b-9571-8bd4fd163bf5-0
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.241
And now they're having a
conversation. The man in the hat

8cb4a6af-5212-424b-9571-8bd4fd163bf5-1
00:22:35.241 --> 00:22:40.228
and the other man, and he man in
the hat is asking about, appears

8cb4a6af-5212-424b-9571-8bd4fd163bf5-2
00:22:40.228 --> 00:22:45.214
to be looking for something, and
he's talking to the man about it

8cb4a6af-5212-424b-9571-8bd4fd163bf5-3
00:22:45.214 --> 00:22:49.747
and drawing a picture of the
tail. This is the tail that we

8cb4a6af-5212-424b-9571-8bd4fd163bf5-4
00:22:49.747 --> 00:22:50.050
saw.

f41a9282-b342-4471-bf36-90da9ece77bb-0
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:58.249
The shadow of on his house maybe
the that is something that he is

f41a9282-b342-4471-bf36-90da9ece77bb-1
00:22:58.249 --> 00:23:04.403
looking for, trying to discern
what what it may mean to his

f41a9282-b342-4471-bf36-90da9ece77bb-2
00:23:04.403 --> 00:23:10.044
house at home. His wife,
daughter still are and man is

f41a9282-b342-4471-bf36-90da9ece77bb-3
00:23:10.044 --> 00:23:14.250
telling him a story about this
creature.

c390bc65-4888-461b-b3fb-f79e64182801-0
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.200
And.

4a3186ef-cc05-4bb2-8c41-b4dd47970c22-0
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:25.309
Apparently he has had some kind
of apocalyptic vision he has

4a3186ef-cc05-4bb2-8c41-b4dd47970c22-1
00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:30.660
seen in the sky something
overwhelming that he.

de73585b-195a-4086-ad51-d86aff4f72e6-0
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.500
It means a lot to him.

#START_make_a_splash Wow, it
looks like a big swimming pool

0bd8d7fb-af7d-4045-899f-91e008ef6f4c-1
00:24:01.352 --> 00:24:02.880
with a lot of slides.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:10.800
As in slides for people to slide
down to the pool.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.415
My kids love these things every
time they come to me and they

around. Arnie is organizing fun

00:24:57.732 --> 00:25:02.281
we're looking for Penguins in
this. Well, anyway, we're just

00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:06.905

have to pick up. OK, OK. But we

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:10.858
have several things here. We
have what looks like an

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.608
And a lot of people have gotten
down there and have landed in

d51418b1-befc-4f07-b709-37fa3253c184-1
00:25:22.608 --> 00:25:26.546
the water. Here's somebody
shooting a a gun, a water gun at

d51418b1-befc-4f07-b709-37fa3253c184-2
00:25:26.546 --> 00:25:27.990
somebody in the water.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.555
That might be redundant, but uh,
that's what they're doing.

1d7a76b4-3e37-4deb-a8cc-e9b5b3e2b38c-1
00:25:32.555 --> 00:25:34.410
There's always somebody with.

Causing a problem.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.459
And here's another one a slide
that's really convoluted. That's

87c7a8bf-3db1-4972-94f3-a826731b7e2e-1
00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:49.220
one I probably wouldn't want to
go down.

had been down it already.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:02.247
Here's, uh, somebody riding on a
fish there. They're having a

00:26:02.247 --> 00:26:06.212
high old time. Most of these
people, I don't see anybody in

218c55d5-b653-4a40-be43-1406ac50b952-2
00:26:06.212 --> 00:26:07.600
any kind of distress.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:17.373
We have some people wearing.
Most people are wearing bathing

cdc5b195-0e05-4ca7-9fe1-a2f0ca156ad3-1
00:26:17.373 --> 00:26:17.740

daaf1586-3c9b-4dff-aa47-a646cf2b36c8-0
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.820
Little boy on him, and here's a
lifeguard.

b1f0a0d8-ff40-4b59-a18c-3b3d3918ca1e-0
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.646
And the bridges and places to
walk out there seems to be

b1f0a0d8-ff40-4b59-a18c-3b3d3918ca1e-1
00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:47.638
generally easy to get around in
this place. There don't seem to

b1f0a0d8-ff40-4b59-a18c-3b3d3918ca1e-2
00:26:47.638 --> 00:26:48.730
be any blocks.

Uh.

8a5cbf9c-24ed-48fc-ad23-49ccc7c8350f-0
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:58.160
Here's the big ship with the
ladders on it.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.517
The people are climbing, maybe
they're going to jump off of

2310c52d-bdb0-4861-bbdc-945819547d47-1
00:27:03.517 --> 00:27:07.693
that too, but anyway, it looks
like they're very happy scene

2310c52d-bdb0-4861-bbdc-945819547d47-2
00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:11.869
and I imagine this would be a
very popular place for people.

2310c52d-bdb0-4861-bbdc-945819547d47-3
00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:16.045
We have some palm trees over on
one side and what looks like

2310c52d-bdb0-4861-bbdc-945819547d47-4
00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:20.084
beach area, though there's
nobody lying out on it. They're

2310c52d-bdb0-4861-bbdc-945819547d47-5
00:27:20.084 --> 00:27:22.959
more interested in going down
the slides.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.460
All in bright colors. And here's
another one. Here's a.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.385
Out of the boulders coming a big
gush of water like a waterfall

909ba4a8-e598-4192-9ca9-1c8ba50efbe4-1
00:27:37.385 --> 00:27:40.880

{Alright, so we're going to
continue with the story, which

15 minutes.}

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.710
A young man and there's a kite
in the room.

7ba0f098-57d1-4c16-a18a-af956d61ae55-0
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.370

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:40.870
Stop.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:52.140
And uh, there's wallpaper on the
walls and old fashioned house.

3a2e6b7d-7cf2-44f7-a6ee-e10e23c386a7-0
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.336
He's on the 2nd, 2nd floor in a
bedroom up there must be his

3a2e6b7d-7cf2-44f7-a6ee-e10e23c386a7-1
00:29:59.336 --> 00:29:59.790
room.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:01.820
Uh.

8213c61c-0a2e-49f2-8d5e-fddb30431215-0
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:12.907
And then we see another view of
the upstairs becomes out of his

8213c61c-0a2e-49f2-8d5e-fddb30431215-1
00:30:12.907 --> 00:30:13.400
room.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.830
Maybe this is in his room.

6630bd55-17d8-4600-aaf4-35b4b0463320-0
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.890
Say.

3f5d4126-6735-45e0-b682-7cc1c2e32326-0
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:30.873
Pretty dark picture. So and
there's a cat on the on a chair

3f5d4126-6735-45e0-b682-7cc1c2e32326-1
00:30:30.873 --> 00:30:35.290
in there. It looks like a a
lavatory.

32a9e2e1-272c-4044-a9d4-e20af6220e84-0
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:44.320
And downstairs there's a kitchen
and the stairway going up and.

06732cfc-c8fe-47df-b08f-24135b07b6de-0
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:53.440
Downstairs again there is a
little boy who is painting a

06732cfc-c8fe-47df-b08f-24135b07b6de-1
00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.014
doorway on the wall. So he is
going somewhere in his

06732cfc-c8fe-47df-b08f-24135b07b6de-2
00:31:00.014 --> 00:31:04.480
imagination. He is wearing a
crown.

5082190c-ce68-4301-82db-6abecf234ca2-0
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.080
Perhaps the looks like a crown.

443d799b-a461-4379-bb95-4d9d41b5424e-0
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.932
OK, now the guy upstairs has got
a that's a drawing board he was

443d799b-a461-4379-bb95-4d9d41b5424e-1
00:31:19.932 --> 00:31:22.680
at. It was difficult to see what
what it was.

961a14e2-c9ff-4826-ac24-87fc93407e0f-0
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:30.116
And the kite is on the floor and
he's picking, gotten up and

961a14e2-c9ff-4826-ac24-87fc93407e0f-1
00:31:30.116 --> 00:31:32.350
picking up the kite and.

c93197f8-cd65-4b64-9a4c-1e884d3990db-0
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:40.960
Looking out through this door
that has been constructed.

ead8bc32-09a0-4892-83eb-d26036908e46-0
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.530
And he has gone that far.

ffb92abb-4f2d-47b8-bd19-1d6bf66dc7fc-0
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.680
Three years into an enchanted
forest.

338e51d0-6b4d-4f59-a253-76b661659a62-0
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:56.660
Ah well, lanterns hanging
everywhere.

8b0454fd-0ed5-482d-8203-09ea36e29f80-0
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.485
Very pleasant, idyllic place
with a lake and a dock with a

8b0454fd-0ed5-482d-8203-09ea36e29f80-1
00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:07.590
big red ball at the end of it.

c305cbce-dbf5-4b61-bcbf-cf160511737d-0
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:17.903
He picks up the ball and he sees
a boat with the Dragons head or

c305cbce-dbf5-4b61-bcbf-cf160511737d-1
00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:19.710
you know that's a.

60a8d126-40b6-49c5-8956-ae408fab7826-0
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.420
Somewhere between a fish and A
and a horse and a.

d6eaa98f-04e2-4ddc-87df-05f3ae071f52-0
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.060
Green eyes.

916e2039-8264-4d3e-ac05-1c80c7e02efb-0
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:35.370
And the lights are all reflected
in this river appears to be. And

916e2039-8264-4d3e-ac05-1c80c7e02efb-1
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.480
it comes to him at the end of
his talk he gets.

0ae870b6-c08e-44b3-bf92-0e995fc87a11-0
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:48.570
Just the dock and no, he it goes
by him and he jumps on it and he

0ae870b6-c08e-44b3-bf92-0e995fc87a11-1
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:54.780
is sailing away with his red
ball on the Dragon ship.

f188fc0d-9a87-4b8c-8305-2fa5b8f36790-0
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.640
And he comes to a city.

3e9463d2-8881-4802-a68e-6ec196057159-0
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:05.672
City looks, uh, as if the light
going on there. There are domed

3e9463d2-8881-4802-a68e-6ec196057159-1
00:33:05.672 --> 00:33:10.490
buildings and watchtowers and
maybe churches.

3ed81f0c-8840-4cdf-a72b-7791286a71dd-0
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:17.306
I have a lot of tall buildings
and this river is going through

3ed81f0c-8840-4cdf-a72b-7791286a71dd-1
00:33:17.306 --> 00:33:17.940
the city.

bc5da22b-355f-4f9f-9953-61e87c13e516-0
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.240
This is all new to him.

2ba2d461-ec13-488b-bb51-f1cf2c67e646-0
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.290
Years.

aa005245-5e92-4b28-a54d-eee838189797-0
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:40.393
He's in the boat, he's in the
boat, has a paddle wheel on it,

aa005245-5e92-4b28-a54d-eee838189797-1
00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:41.650
and he sees.

79225560-b7d0-4da4-b554-58f241db3042-0
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:50.228
The moon is full and he can see
what looks like a little boy in

79225560-b7d0-4da4-b554-58f241db3042-1
00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:56.209
a red boat crossing over the
river on a bridge between one

79225560-b7d0-4da4-b554-58f241db3042-2
00:33:56.209 --> 00:33:59.150
part of the city and another.

dfc82c89-844c-4d4b-b786-8149134ca9d3-0
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.166
He leaps off of the boat,
leaving his ball on it, and he's

dfc82c89-844c-4d4b-b786-8149134ca9d3-1
00:34:08.166 --> 00:34:13.652
breathing some people there, so
he apparently knows this place.

dfc82c89-844c-4d4b-b786-8149134ca9d3-2
00:34:13.652 --> 00:34:18.794
There's this young boy with a
crown going up the stairs and

dfc82c89-844c-4d4b-b786-8149134ca9d3-3
00:34:18.794 --> 00:34:24.108
he's waving to that those people
who seem to be greeting that

dfc82c89-844c-4d4b-b786-8149134ca9d3-4
00:34:24.108 --> 00:34:28.480
boy, and they've got a wind of
creature with them.

3264ae06-fb4c-4d76-a347-c4c3c310c730-0
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.023
Looks like a woman maybe, and
another little boy with a hat on

3264ae06-fb4c-4d76-a347-c4c3c310c730-1
00:34:37.023 --> 00:34:42.400
that's similar to the other eye
they are, crowns the he comes

3264ae06-fb4c-4d76-a347-c4c3c310c730-2
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.650
and this is obviously a royal
family that he is.

94dac2cd-cc66-473c-99b3-9292803b5417-0
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.710
Reading.

53a6d45d-49df-4437-a13f-7ead9e2973d1-0
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.960
A little girl.

cbd2e34e-1fdb-4c60-a87e-0369c7a50ff9-0
00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:00.030
Is turning up her nose at the at
the throne the whole oh, it's an

cbd2e34e-1fdb-4c60-a87e-0369c7a50ff9-1
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:05.588
old man with a beard. It's not a
woman, it's a white beard that

cbd2e34e-1fdb-4c60-a87e-0369c7a50ff9-2
00:35:05.588 --> 00:35:10.884
he has. And the two children
there are looking at these this

cbd2e34e-1fdb-4c60-a87e-0369c7a50ff9-3
00:35:10.884 --> 00:35:15.747
throne, or maybe it's two
Thrones and the little boy is

cbd2e34e-1fdb-4c60-a87e-0369c7a50ff9-4
00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:18.960
interested in it. A little girl
not.

ab669d85-944b-47ca-896d-5f6953257012-0
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.070
And now we see in a.

c1aa6259-6fb5-41ea-b428-52e9b6fe8f48-0
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.456
So that's the ship that he has
come in on. They are looking

c1aa6259-6fb5-41ea-b428-52e9b6fe8f48-1
00:35:31.456 --> 00:35:35.672
back and there is somebody
coming up the stairs at them and

c1aa6259-6fb5-41ea-b428-52e9b6fe8f48-2
00:35:35.672 --> 00:35:37.710
they appear to be frightened.

418aaf39-c015-4a7b-9045-7131505b4bda-0
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.020
The bird is flapping its wings.

99f48ecf-6654-4634-b274-a7572aca6d3f-0
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:54.022
This person coming off the boat
is hard to tell what it is,

99f48ecf-6654-4634-b274-a7572aca6d3f-1
00:35:54.022 --> 00:35:55.280
whether it's a.

5aec7e9b-eda8-46d6-8264-0bfed0dcf271-0
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.320
Maybe a warrior?

f7e21624-0ebc-4640-a423-b891f7c93003-0
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:08.431
Now these several people are
coming out all of the vote, all

f7e21624-0ebc-4640-a423-b891f7c93003-1
00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:13.322
right, the vote had those people
in it that they didn't know

f7e21624-0ebc-4640-a423-b891f7c93003-2
00:36:13.322 --> 00:36:18.213
about, but they apparently are
hazardous and the king is has

f7e21624-0ebc-4640-a423-b891f7c93003-3
00:36:18.213 --> 00:36:23.105
some kind of a magic wand or
something in his hand that he's

f7e21624-0ebc-4640-a423-b891f7c93003-4
00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:25.269
trying to repel the people.

70c0ce2e-500e-49ed-9016-2ed05e88f0b5-0
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.212
Some of those, if he's being
terribly successful because they

70c0ce2e-500e-49ed-9016-2ed05e88f0b5-1
00:36:30.212 --> 00:36:31.540
are coming up the stairs.

03839334-997e-440a-8a1e-2553f870afbc-0
00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.710
So, ah, here he is. He has.

22a64653-44d2-4518-a702-97f5b7680771-0
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.950
Is as a sword.

4d2cd1db-130c-4258-92a9-482e51d0c5b7-0
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.830
And he is threatening these
people.

56170094-8e99-426e-a4ef-6cbc6906cd46-0
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:54.230
But they come up and grab him
anyway. He's.

7ba2bfbe-27c1-47b2-8a75-4ceef4561482-0
00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:01.501
All weapons that he has, he's
used up and they have something

7ba2bfbe-27c1-47b2-8a75-4ceef4561482-1
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:06.524
that is repelling shield of some
kind that's repelling the sword

7ba2bfbe-27c1-47b2-8a75-4ceef4561482-2
00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:11.315
and anything else he has. And
now they've grabbed him and one

7ba2bfbe-27c1-47b2-8a75-4ceef4561482-3
00:37:11.315 --> 00:37:14.020
of them is headed into the
palace.

581c9357-acf7-4bae-accf-2493050e9a53-0
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:25.351
So now the as this warrior comes
after them, these people are

581c9357-acf7-4bae-accf-2493050e9a53-1
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:31.752
larger. The boy and the girl and
the visitor and the bird are

581c9357-acf7-4bae-accf-2493050e9a53-2
00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:38.257
getting larger. And the boy is
drawing the bird even larger so

581c9357-acf7-4bae-accf-2493050e9a53-3
00:37:38.257 --> 00:37:44.039
that they can as some magic
bird. I see that is a horse

581c9357-acf7-4bae-accf-2493050e9a53-4
00:37:44.039 --> 00:37:47.240
Pegasus. Here we have escaping.

ed9b376d-c258-4e3e-9389-9d6f6f98c253-0
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:53.912
On this flying horse and the
moon is still full and they're

ed9b376d-c258-4e3e-9389-9d6f6f98c253-1
00:37:53.912 --> 00:37:56.580
going out over the water.

58b69358-a6e3-4968-b240-9a769efa2b1b-0
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.610
Yes, they are on the water.

1bdae186-214f-40d0-9146-aa4262e23ab9-0
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.330
We are bringing with them the
boat that they came on.

05a593ac-e747-449f-88d0-f0e3870b2780-0
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:25.801
There appear to be these
warriors, these interlopers on

05a593ac-e747-449f-88d0-f0e3870b2780-1
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:30.506
that, but it is coming with
them. It is somehow attached to

05a593ac-e747-449f-88d0-f0e3870b2780-2
00:38:30.506 --> 00:38:30.820
the.

a9452c89-ec7b-4a3a-a255-525ea4bd99b7-0
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.560
Wings of the horse bird.

ae654923-50fe-4dc5-b47e-59d97de222e5-0
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.940
So they have not escaped it
entirely.

dfe0067f-c060-467e-aab1-882794f5ecd4-0
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.720
It's developed wings too.

288666c1-836f-43bf-a86e-b7c738be2e87-0
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.260
OK.

6821e042-b9e9-4979-9479-4d5aa19c1b1d-0
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:57.540
And now that boat has knocked
the birds feathers off.

8b9a52e6-7989-46b8-b147-61747c692c0c-0
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.218
Out of the sky and the people
who were on it are falling

8b9a52e6-7989-46b8-b147-61747c692c0c-1
00:39:04.218 --> 00:39:09.547
through the sky. The girl is
losing her crown, the visitor is

8b9a52e6-7989-46b8-b147-61747c692c0c-2
00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:13.930
holding on to her, and they had
the people on the.

c71c2ac0-bb19-427d-ac26-f747e9cb1788-0
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.630
Boat have seized the little boy
with the crown.

bf40833b-08f5-46f5-bf1d-142d18ae4947-0
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:23.160
The.

5412383e-82f3-4b15-bca7-6e56a8abf4ea-0
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.120
Girl and the visitor visiting
boy have.

cbc0e03e-8723-4755-a53a-528fefc40414-0
00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:34.220
Gone underwater, there are fish
under there and it looks like a

cbc0e03e-8723-4755-a53a-528fefc40414-1
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.430
submerged city.

125af14a-511c-4747-8644-72d95e76da17-0
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.870
And now, little girl.

eb55f175-61de-4c92-96da-1e32f92e33a9-0
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:47.485
Who has been carrying this red
pen with her magic pen if flying

eb55f175-61de-4c92-96da-1e32f92e33a9-1
00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:53.349
a an escape hatch for them and
the bird has returned to its

eb55f175-61de-4c92-96da-1e32f92e33a9-2
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:56.769
usual size, and here they are.
OK.

3390797e-cf08-48c9-acf8-cc2f8ccedda1-0
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:01.870
Now.

b44ce89c-3df2-4353-b8f8-c93117afec9f-0
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.990
They are in a submarine, that's
what she is drawing. So they

b44ce89c-3df2-4353-b8f8-c93117afec9f-1
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.740
have a ship.

99fedd68-e48d-48d7-b33b-6bd9ee99bfa7-0
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:16.084
Uh, the the man is the visitor
is in there, and the girl they

99fedd68-e48d-48d7-b33b-6bd9ee99bfa7-1
00:40:16.084 --> 00:40:19.690
are submerged in this
underwater.

7efc52bc-f133-431f-b389-0ee4a431f7c4-0
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:28.205
Landscape looks like a bunch of
coral, fish and so forth and

7efc52bc-f133-431f-b389-0ee4a431f7c4-1
00:40:28.205 --> 00:40:34.827
they're OK. They have a whole
Periscope of over the water and

7efc52bc-f133-431f-b389-0ee4a431f7c4-2
00:40:34.827 --> 00:40:39.420
they are able to press forward
underwater.

9a11534d-a452-42b2-a274-3bc9cdcd5df6-0
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:47.892
Now they've come to a grotto
where the boat is coming up out

9a11534d-a452-42b2-a274-3bc9cdcd5df6-1
00:40:47.892 --> 00:40:49.520
of the water and is.

a876c0d6-4329-48ab-852e-9227489c2c11-0
00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.098
The armed, shall we say, on what
appears to be a gravelly, rocky

a876c0d6-4329-48ab-852e-9227489c2c11-1
00:41:00.098 --> 00:41:03.710
shore, and they're in a cave,
it's a.

dfc3805b-cf72-43bd-8ea1-ed8c86c6cedc-0
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.190
There.

50c86dd7-df40-46ff-a612-c192b76009b9-0
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.873
Hard to tell what's up on this
roof of this thing, where these

50c86dd7-df40-46ff-a612-c192b76009b9-1
00:41:11.873 --> 00:41:12.130
are.

30656ffe-4f2b-49b9-8667-be367424d4a5-0
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.840
Relics that were there.

bb6cd0ea-51d4-463b-aa0e-65d1fe3970a7-0
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.530
Hmm.

92f21e98-e969-4a08-bf41-c4274208be34-0
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:21.480
Yeah.

7d79dad3-5524-4212-8792-ae6b4ce0e973-0
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.511
And they're pointing ohh. These
are drawings on the wall of

7d79dad3-5524-4212-8792-ae6b4ce0e973-1
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:33.554
things happening, and the girl
is pointing them out to the

7d79dad3-5524-4212-8792-ae6b4ce0e973-2
00:41:33.554 --> 00:41:37.460
fellow who's visiting her.
There's a place here with the

7d79dad3-5524-4212-8792-ae6b4ce0e973-3
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.270
door in it in the rock, and the
bird is.

4ceb1b9e-f173-442c-9980-180ebe9331ac-0
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.860
Keeping vigil?

6604cfc8-0012-44e8-9c36-ac1e60fae223-0
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.620
Uh.

c0af103f-7c62-4377-9c96-d5a35c7641e1-0
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:53.792
Then, uh, they the boy, the the
visitor, the girl and the bird.

c0af103f-7c62-4377-9c96-d5a35c7641e1-1
00:41:53.792 --> 00:41:59.530
They're in income, the incomes,
the original horse.

75077300-67e3-45d6-84e2-c0388f27c4df-0
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.812
Vote with people who are after
them and they're hiding behind a

75077300-67e3-45d6-84e2-c0388f27c4df-1
00:42:07.812 --> 00:42:08.510
pillar.

ed6b7dbf-4f4f-49e1-be70-0448b012275d-0
00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:10.850
Now.

100add0f-6bb2-49ef-b286-52db9279b559-0
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.362
The visitor and the bird and the
girl are there, and the visitor

100add0f-6bb2-49ef-b286-52db9279b559-1
00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:24.733
has drawn a cage for the bird.
Apparently he's going to kill

100add0f-6bb2-49ef-b286-52db9279b559-2
00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:26.230
the bird is safe.

f30a3a0c-1a90-41fb-9726-2ee1966d90fa-0
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.670
And here come the intruders.

dd6b5d15-d1e4-493b-b178-fb670f97ffff-0
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:41.031
Who are going to who are trying
to get the bird? Apparently the

dd6b5d15-d1e4-493b-b178-fb670f97ffff-1
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:42.710
bird is the prize and.

643e838b-ee63-4311-a265-27f254273605-0
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:49.820
He's after that bird with some
kind of a gadget.

e0f1b925-7758-412f-9865-876c79c5710f-0
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.540
Well, maybe it's a cage that he
wants to put him in.

5c1e6882-6033-4cd4-a976-c08d0ce0763b-0
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:05.357
And instead he comes up and is a
trip thing that he gets the the

5c1e6882-6033-4cd4-a976-c08d0ce0763b-1
00:43:05.357 --> 00:43:12.794
villain is in the bird cage, the
bird gets out and the cage

5c1e6882-6033-4cd4-a976-c08d0ce0763b-2
00:43:12.794 --> 00:43:14.530
closes around.

f40f1381-6c7a-4cd7-9d08-986ac168d193-0
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.590
Him so they have toward had the
villain.

a1f2c25f-039d-4ee3-abad-f99ea32b706b-0
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.700
Now we have the bird has become
huge and.

6dcac768-c929-4d1e-8efa-45c658eea360-0
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:31.940
The.

63494260-19ad-4ec1-8acd-d20d3c7dbd73-0
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:33.870
Hey.

3bc77fd6-e91b-4622-bc54-8426ad07ac03-0
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.610
Boy, on the drawing board.

ce4cf25c-00d3-4b1d-a725-839115b4143c-0
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.233
Destroys the weapon that this
person has brought in, the

ce4cf25c-00d3-4b1d-a725-839115b4143c-1
00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:43.950
villain has brought in.

39185cb4-1123-4ca6-b0a7-790056683931-0
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.222
And there's all kinds of
celebration in the sky, all

39185cb4-1123-4ca6-b0a7-790056683931-1
00:43:49.222 --> 00:43:52.170
kinds of colors and fireworks
there.

91c04f89-e27b-490e-af55-49a419dc3f22-0
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.960
Ohh.

832c8a7c-b96a-46b1-ac03-3bcdb4d45871-0
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.500
And here is the king.

13155f0d-9c06-4638-b807-2a6676f85ead-0
00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:01.942
And the other other little boy
and the the villains are being

13155f0d-9c06-4638-b807-2a6676f85ead-1
00:44:01.942 --> 00:44:05.080
vanquished. They're sinking into
the sea.

7aad090b-e7c8-4680-862b-dcecd59e2231-0
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.060
Uh.

2f99b074-959f-48c0-89ca-2ea8132c2503-0
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:16.464
And here is the bird carrying
off the villain in the cage, and

2f99b074-959f-48c0-89ca-2ea8132c2503-1
00:44:16.464 --> 00:44:22.349
the king and the little boy with
the crown. The Prince and the

2f99b074-959f-48c0-89ca-2ea8132c2503-2
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:28.514
little girl, and with her marker
and the guy at the drawing board

2f99b074-959f-48c0-89ca-2ea8132c2503-3
00:44:28.514 --> 00:44:31.129
are left safe in the grotto.

60bdb8bb-3a37-4962-84e3-a3f33b077808-0
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:39.300
And the ship with the villains
in it is sailing away.

4a456ea7-58d4-4522-b729-3c82f9f964a4-0
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:47.882
The girl now is calling this all
of the that the drawing board is

4a456ea7-58d4-4522-b729-3c82f9f964a4-1
00:44:47.882 --> 00:44:54.080
very happy with him and his
thanking him for saving them.

1a65567c-7f19-4838-9fe9-cb4fb24f8064-0
00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:01.992
And we know the height is going
through the door, so they're off

1a65567c-7f19-4838-9fe9-cb4fb24f8064-1
00:45:01.992 --> 00:45:04.620
on another adventure in the
city.

f4687841-894b-4c4b-8ba6-5ae310431f1f-0
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:11.358
Right up here and here is the
house where we originally saw

f4687841-894b-4c4b-8ba6-5ae310431f1f-1
00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:16.900
the guy with the drawing board
and his arched doorway that has

f4687841-894b-4c4b-8ba6-5ae310431f1f-2
00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:22.530
led him out into this adventure
in the first place. #END_return

16b6f13d-a127-40ea-b092-094720592a0c-0
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.801
{Alright, so that was the story.
You can go on to the next one,

16b6f13d-a127-40ea-b092-094720592a0c-1
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:30.850
which is a complex scene.}

814ca382-15db-47d2-9d64-9f7043c6d057-0
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.594
{So please take between three
and five minutes as you describe

814ca382-15db-47d2-9d64-9f7043c6d057-1
00:45:36.594 --> 00:45:37.400
what you see.}

a89354ab-37c9-482d-bd9c-209b8db24531-0
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.397
#START_unfriendly_giants And
these are the unfriendly giants,

a89354ab-37c9-482d-bd9c-209b8db24531-1
00:45:44.397 --> 00:45:47.079
and they are large people
compared with some of the

a89354ab-37c9-482d-bd9c-209b8db24531-2
00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:47.440
others.

7ff4ad94-0647-45a3-bfc8-b141757b1b71-0
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.920


db5e21a7-e9d2-4392-9fa9-064b274656f1-0
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.210
And the locals, if they're up to
no good.

67cb3dbe-02b6-43d3-b86c-9e42fd6e3a19-0
00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:05.680
Uh, are trying to lasso house
with a bunch of people around

67cb3dbe-02b6-43d3-b86c-9e42fd6e3a19-1
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.260
it. They are.

20c928ef-da0b-4d91-b8b0-94936a4abc4d-0
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:11.660
Hard to tell what's under foot
here. Some of it.

b0218975-24f1-4068-8f5c-c8ed6f76aa55-0
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:17.730
Guess it's all solid ground. I
don't see any boats although

b0218975-24f1-4068-8f5c-c8ed6f76aa55-1
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:18.220
there.

1bc20b50-516c-46a2-a7dd-494411821a9b-0
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:25.229
Kind of watery color, but the
and trees and people are

1bc20b50-516c-46a2-a7dd-494411821a9b-1
00:46:25.229 --> 00:46:29.927
picnicking. People are living
their lives. Appears in this

1bc20b50-516c-46a2-a7dd-494411821a9b-2
00:46:29.927 --> 00:46:34.944
village and the giants have come
in and are playing chess with

1bc20b50-516c-46a2-a7dd-494411821a9b-3
00:46:34.944 --> 00:46:35.820
the people.

1a7c4cba-f26c-4a33-835a-b05172b9bbe7-0
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.050
Manipulating them and.

87d00d3d-b509-4cfc-97a4-a148f478a110-0
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.100
They have.

b90ce0d9-da0f-4704-a3f3-2ac6df841453-0
00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.180
Yeah, they've got the pipes that
they are.

9936f27b-7e39-4e24-a99b-c610c872e1de-0
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.050
Blowing through at the people
and hurting them.

d846cdbf-bf34-43b4-b7dc-090eb3448cae-0
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:57.830
Uh.

3a78f5b7-ea80-49fa-8254-4f4212439dc7-0
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.280
There.

355455cb-4a65-4061-86b4-46de74fe4762-0
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.910
Twirl one of them is messing up
with a windmill.

9b6e7dc7-7220-43ff-85bb-7246a9d4a300-0
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.290
Maybe.

a41e3b2e-6161-4585-8d88-e5d9e2cdd867-0
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.160
Seems to be rotating it.

6de97017-a49f-4083-83fe-80d9860cf022-0
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:18.772
And they're so large that they
are causing a lot of problems

6de97017-a49f-4083-83fe-80d9860cf022-1
00:47:18.772 --> 00:47:20.470
for these smaller people.

438ffbb9-135e-4402-8097-18a689f84aef-0
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.080
And uprooting trees.

ebb31c86-894e-4116-a9d5-7cee80e293c1-0
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:35.340
Uh, and taking over.

7a9280b6-68f2-441a-9604-3c3834ffeb83-0
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:49.935
But the people don't seem to be
particularly frightened, except

7a9280b6-68f2-441a-9604-3c3834ffeb83-1
00:47:49.935 --> 00:47:53.780
the ones who they were. They're
shooting the water through their

7a9280b6-68f2-441a-9604-3c3834ffeb83-2
00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.550
pea shooters.

377f6427-7fcf-4165-9c79-d2e91a8f18af-0
00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:59.084
They're hurting those people,
but the others don't seem to be

377f6427-7fcf-4165-9c79-d2e91a8f18af-1
00:47:59.084 --> 00:48:02.034
terribly perturbed. They're
going about their business as

377f6427-7fcf-4165-9c79-d2e91a8f18af-2
00:48:02.034 --> 00:48:02.340
usual.

d1c003cb-6200-461f-96d9-8e86be1551f9-0
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.576
One of them is got a bunch of
people on a rope. He's walking

d1c003cb-6200-461f-96d9-8e86be1551f9-1
00:48:14.576 --> 00:48:16.570
along and dragging them with
him.

02240fc7-7fbd-4e4c-a52e-dffb7df804b8-0
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:18.020
Hmm.

af28e9fb-9924-43a1-8db2-b18ba2115340-0
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.786
And he has a bunch of people
around his waist that he's

af28e9fb-9924-43a1-8db2-b18ba2115340-1
00:48:23.786 --> 00:48:24.640
carrying too.

7d9f6b82-8adb-4817-a381-6bd171688fda-0
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.950
No, that's this is a.

908a0a26-cfae-4bb9-bb10-8052b25b0802-0
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:43.314
Ambiguous, certainly this whole
picture. Hard to tell if they're

908a0a26-cfae-4bb9-bb10-8052b25b0802-1
00:48:43.314 --> 00:48:48.469

00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:53.542
because they're large that they
are taking over. And it's hard

908a0a26-cfae-4bb9-bb10-8052b25b0802-3
00:48:53.542 --> 00:48:58.697
to see that. See the people are
not having anything much to say

Some of the people have gotten
into the Rhinos pen. That's not

00:50:58.448 --> 00:51:03.150

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:21.245
a parrot who has bought now, and
the monkeys or the gorillas, I

And there are some lions
watching everything.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.150
I'm not sure who is escaping
from the zoo, if anybody.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:49.256
There's some birds up on top of
the cafe that look as if they

71d0e0fc-4aa7-4941-b4f6-a42871202f6c-1
00:51:49.256 --> 00:51:51.340
could go anywhere at any time.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:01.830
There's a polar bear in a river
or in a pond. Pool.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.716
Maybe he's intended to go
underneath here, into this ice

1cb404e7-c6b9-43f6-be33-9c25fb8a598f-1
00:52:08.716 --> 00:52:10.430

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.930
There are several bears there.
They have quite a.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.086
I think that this is kind of a
crazy zoo.

00:52:56.167 --> 00:53:01.300
here's a relatively modern
looking airliner but people

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.979

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:37.580

they call him.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.054
It's an original over there and
something that looks like a

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.667
All kinds of planes. So this is
the history of planes,

2eebc86c-17de-4e65-a273-d3a39d06fbf5-1
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:58.490
apparently, which actually is
gone very quickly.

with somebody people falling off

00:54:05.599 --> 00:54:08.140

00:54:14.775 --> 00:54:19.519
another one of the truck with a

00:54:19.519 --> 00:54:23.861
they're trying to get the

00:54:23.861 --> 00:54:28.364

00:54:28.364 --> 00:54:33.510

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:37.450

at this airport.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:55.880

here are hijackers.

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:02.559
Hard to say with these people on
the ground are are trouble or if

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.540
they are causing trouble.

00:56:21.332 --> 00:56:23.160
looks like a tiger.

a1dac7bd-1811-4be4-b34e-5ed75c88a519-0
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.100
Ohh.

cf373428-02d4-459a-ad83-e075c349c712-0
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:29.060
We have people swimming in a
pool.

518e71db-05bc-4a7e-99c0-29abc50285b1-0
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:34.430
Somebody dunking someone else
and with a bucket.

be9ff727-521e-40b1-a754-daf46d7872bd-0
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.640
Ohh.

755362b7-81db-4539-a427-a478015c12b7-0
00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:42.456
So the chef is over there at the
table. Not many people eating

755362b7-81db-4539-a427-a478015c12b7-1
00:56:42.456 --> 00:56:45.410
for some reason. There's a pig
there.

1f32dae4-4876-44f3-97f2-eb09d3593fd7-0
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.400
And here comes somebody with a
gun, another person with a cake.

eb585dd8-ab34-4d4a-b260-c2833c40c71e-0
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.770
So maybe they're just getting
ready for the birthday party.

372aef07-a7b4-407d-a793-5bad66dd3670-0
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.822
Whose birthday it is? Can we
find the birthday person? I

372aef07-a7b4-407d-a793-5bad66dd3670-1
00:56:59.822 --> 00:57:00.550
don't know.

eea87ea5-fe0b-41ab-bc35-7f67e7422d99-0
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:05.745
Here are some whole bunch of
gifts that are on a table that

eea87ea5-fe0b-41ab-bc35-7f67e7422d99-1
00:57:05.745 --> 00:57:06.890
people are bringing.

92350ae5-2b02-41ee-b51c-d338f2106fea-0
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:09.630
And.

bfdf4632-d9f0-46de-b17c-8c4c5648ac29-0
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.550
There's somebody dressed like an
Angel.

79cd2e71-36c1-4cce-996d-23a3fde68e5f-0
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:18.320
And somebody dressed as a devil.

1cb1cd7b-40a9-4333-8d0a-29f6cac25d5e-0
00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:23.984
Another person with a gun
splatting somebody from within

1cb1cd7b-40a9-4333-8d0a-29f6cac25d5e-1
00:57:23.984 --> 00:57:24.760
the pool.

1c158b71-137e-40b7-a034-69d6d508ba13-0
00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:32.230
And here we have some fairy
princesses. Or one anyway.

99032602-220e-40fb-83c1-a87e569aa125-0
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.580
And a policeman.

b042e8bf-f076-4068-9808-45f9c957b7d6-0
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.650
Looks like some ghouls.

404e2ed8-d7f0-46db-ab30-694bc8936777-0
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.350
They're seeing someone dressed
as a dog.

bffac481-4612-41e3-98ce-498914a6de05-0
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:54.517
Another person with a with a
pinata. Over here, people lined

bffac481-4612-41e3-98ce-498914a6de05-1
00:57:54.517 --> 00:57:59.750
up to attack that. That all
kinds of birthday fun.

a6cc1232-bd02-466a-919e-8814f5fd6472-0
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:06.851
Here is a witch, or a skeleton
and a devil and a Superman. And

a6cc1232-bd02-466a-919e-8814f5fd6472-1
00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:10.798
so this looks like a Halloween
birthday party.

a6cc1232-bd02-466a-919e-8814f5fd6472-2
00:58:10.798 --> 00:58:12.729

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:17.770
{OK.}

529fe07b-a032-4632-9716-6e6f06704273-0
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.334
{So moving on to the next item,
it's another story about 20

00:58:25.334 --> 00:58:25.920
pages.}

cbee1394-2a1f-4da5-9562-77274360b41f-0
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:39.321
#START_quest OK, we have a
statue here in a park and a park

cbee1394-2a1f-4da5-9562-77274360b41f-1
00:58:39.321 --> 00:58:44.140
bench and a trash container.
Statue has wings.

12e5ac3a-6c43-4a43-a7fd-6fc50e6ba906-0
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:52.410
And unkempt hair. So this is
apparently Greek or Roman.

c65df415-5df8-4278-b14a-f52ad66c6fca-0
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:54.350
Uh.

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-0
00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:01.270
And here are a couple of kids
underneath. It's raining. And a

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-1
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:06.010
couple of kids have found refuge
underneath the bridge, so

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-2
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:10.830
they're not going to get wet.
And they have a bicycle there

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-3
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:15.409
where the red wheel on a purple
wheel and there's a door

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-4
00:59:15.409 --> 00:59:20.471
underneath this bridge that they
are looking at. And they have

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-5
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:25.371
with them a purple bird. We've
seen that bird before. One of

f905bf5f-708e-4e90-8d36-531fe863a769-6
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:27.380
them is carrying a magic.

b3ddb89e-20c0-40b5-8ff2-613113b29ffc-0
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.160
Pencil.

9b6e0bf8-bd04-46d6-86e5-ffd6c3bd1c59-0
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:38.098
The door opens and out comes a
shaman king, actually of some

9b6e0bf8-bd04-46d6-86e5-ffd6c3bd1c59-1
00:59:38.098 --> 00:59:42.190
kind, and he is showing them a
drawing.

3f91f89e-b5ed-4cb2-8df9-02a155287f93-0
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:46.430
And.

facfd662-8593-42f3-a3d7-5c431d4063f5-0
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.210
Telling them to be quiet. I
can't tell them what that is.

1272a2bd-94d8-45c5-b0b2-1e4812c0da70-0
00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.482
The bird is looking at it, and
they are somewhat taken aback by

1272a2bd-94d8-45c5-b0b2-1e4812c0da70-1
01:00:02.482 --> 01:00:02.760
it.

b4e4094b-644c-4a64-bbab-2f7f7c1e8e82-0
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.760
There's a warning. Ah, let's
see.

e5f20480-916f-48fb-ba6a-d92ca6a94981-0
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:14.667
Uh he's directing the kids with
this piece of paper ohh telling

e5f20480-916f-48fb-ba6a-d92ca6a94981-1
01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:19.386
them to be quiet. He wants to
show them this and make sure

e5f20480-916f-48fb-ba6a-d92ca6a94981-2
01:00:19.386 --> 01:00:24.264
they get it. They have it and
suddenly outcomes some dealers

e5f20480-916f-48fb-ba6a-d92ca6a94981-3
01:00:24.264 --> 01:00:29.062
who are grabbed the king to
bring him back inside. The kids

e5f20480-916f-48fb-ba6a-d92ca6a94981-4
01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:34.020
are taken aback. They get the
king back and they are now have

e5f20480-916f-48fb-ba6a-d92ca6a94981-5
01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:34.500
their.

0047d9fe-222e-4384-ba0c-ff9f0b2dffa3-0
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:42.135
Magic pencil. They've got two of
them now, I think. Unless,

0047d9fe-222e-4384-ba0c-ff9f0b2dffa3-1
01:00:42.135 --> 01:00:48.051
anyway, the bird is ready to go
and so are they. And they are

0047d9fe-222e-4384-ba0c-ff9f0b2dffa3-2
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:48.909
about to.

dd6db48e-9505-40ab-9e08-e29b722aa480-0
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:55.060
Let's try to do something for
this king was their king.

39f2caaf-a83c-4430-aae4-b5cb95cab7d1-0
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:02.936
OK, the little girl has got an
orange pencil now and her red

39f2caaf-a83c-4430-aae4-b5cb95cab7d1-1
01:01:02.936 --> 01:01:07.838
pencil and he has purple pencil
and the bird is there. So they

39f2caaf-a83c-4430-aae4-b5cb95cab7d1-2
01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:12.195
are armed and ready to go
forward with their paper that

39f2caaf-a83c-4430-aae4-b5cb95cab7d1-3
01:01:12.195 --> 01:01:17.019
the king has given them. We have
a doorway here that they are

39f2caaf-a83c-4430-aae4-b5cb95cab7d1-4
01:01:17.019 --> 01:01:18.420
about to open and.

558c9650-7c6f-40b8-a00b-9860e55607bf-0
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.470
Into a temple underneath this
bridge, and it's still raining.

9759d3f7-1a12-4314-8f24-63249d696338-0
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:29.806
This is the bird keeping watch
and they are opening this door

9759d3f7-1a12-4314-8f24-63249d696338-1
01:01:29.806 --> 01:01:34.762
with their magic. Apparently
they needed the red one and the

9759d3f7-1a12-4314-8f24-63249d696338-2
01:01:34.762 --> 01:01:36.549
purple one to do this.

a3bd835d-5dc0-40fa-bf39-b9ea19de78b1-0
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.915
And then they go. They've opened
the doors with their red and

a3bd835d-5dc0-40fa-bf39-b9ea19de78b1-1
01:01:42.915 --> 01:01:43.500
purple.

e9642c3c-244a-412f-a6f7-66d4e9aa83bd-0
01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.240
Magic pencils.

4f50b7de-cc20-437d-b641-323a86efeec4-0
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:55.408
Now they are inside that. This
scene now is a big city and

4f50b7de-cc20-437d-b641-323a86efeec4-1
01:01:55.408 --> 01:02:00.479
there are flying machines that
are carrying a number of people

4f50b7de-cc20-437d-b641-323a86efeec4-2
01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:02.250
in them. And they are.

e332da80-8813-486d-a98f-325f1928152c-0
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:10.360
Uh have emerged from underwater
uh into this other terrain and.

a0405397-b5e6-4550-91fc-43ade4501311-0
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:26.136
They see a boat going off into
the distance with the king on it

a0405397-b5e6-4550-91fc-43ade4501311-1
01:02:26.136 --> 01:02:33.223
and the he is got some jailers
there so by himself but they see

a0405397-b5e6-4550-91fc-43ade4501311-2
01:02:33.223 --> 01:02:35.770
that where he is going.

c5599665-a0e4-478c-93c6-72df9b587583-0
01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:45.517
Have their diagram that he is
given to them and they are

c5599665-a0e4-478c-93c6-72df9b587583-1
01:02:45.517 --> 01:02:50.699
trying to see what's going on.
He is going off into the sunset

c5599665-a0e4-478c-93c6-72df9b587583-2
01:02:50.699 --> 01:02:55.962
here. The bird is looking and we
have a whole bunch of warriors

c5599665-a0e4-478c-93c6-72df9b587583-3
01:02:55.962 --> 01:03:00.897
and people who are trying to
burn the city down, apparently

c5599665-a0e4-478c-93c6-72df9b587583-4
01:03:00.897 --> 01:03:03.200
who are crossing the bridge.

2bc57928-75a2-451b-b245-acd3879e9476-0
01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:09.861
From one side of the city to
another. Now they have various

2bc57928-75a2-451b-b245-acd3879e9476-1
01:03:09.861 --> 01:03:15.538
places in the city that they can
try to find, and this is a map

2bc57928-75a2-451b-b245-acd3879e9476-2
01:03:15.538 --> 01:03:19.530
of what they need to be doing
and they have.

fdd455e1-3c49-4127-ade4-036c99810a3b-0
01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:25.337
Like a labyrinth, they've got a
red and purple root, and it

fdd455e1-3c49-4127-ade4-036c99810a3b-1
01:03:25.337 --> 01:03:29.696
appears those are the ones,
they're going to be taking this.

fdd455e1-3c49-4127-ade4-036c99810a3b-2
01:03:29.696 --> 01:03:33.984
We've got a rainbow on the
outside, but they're going to be

fdd455e1-3c49-4127-ade4-036c99810a3b-3
01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:37.700
using their red and their
purple, both spins of the

fdd455e1-3c49-4127-ade4-036c99810a3b-4
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.345
rainbow, to to get to find their
way to where it is they need to

fdd455e1-3c49-4127-ade4-036c99810a3b-5
01:03:42.345 --> 01:03:42.559
be.

b005065f-4106-4350-bacc-8f28b1720bda-0
01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:48.375
And it looks as if they are
looking for a palm trees and

b005065f-4106-4350-bacc-8f28b1720bda-1
01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:49.040
blue eyes.

72687559-92b1-4f86-bbc1-b04447867637-0
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:52.230
OK.

bfb77e33-6652-4652-a8da-348bff83ee65-0
01:03:54.850 --> 01:04:00.486
You know, here comes some boats
with some of these warriors on

bfb77e33-6652-4652-a8da-348bff83ee65-1
01:04:00.486 --> 01:04:05.944
them and the bird is sounding
the alarm. They have got their

bfb77e33-6652-4652-a8da-348bff83ee65-2
01:04:05.944 --> 01:04:11.850
red and their purple pencils and
are ready to embark. And they've

bfb77e33-6652-4652-a8da-348bff83ee65-3
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:15.250
got red fins for swimming and
purple.

ffcee55d-6973-4451-b589-547dd63fbf45-0
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:19.820
The bird.

9bac2555-e00b-4b3c-b568-b2a75461651e-0
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.335
Can't tell if that's a cat on
his shoulder or not. Anyway,

9bac2555-e00b-4b3c-b568-b2a75461651e-1
01:04:25.335 --> 01:04:29.803
they are ready to go underwater
and strike out and see what they

9bac2555-e00b-4b3c-b568-b2a75461651e-2
01:04:29.803 --> 01:04:32.140
can do to try to rescue the
king.

46902f66-650d-4055-8df8-754255b7e1b1-0
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:39.230
OK, they grabbed onto an octopus
here, octopus, and the bird is

46902f66-650d-4055-8df8-754255b7e1b1-1
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:44.322
with them wearing red so that
they can. The bird is a magic

46902f66-650d-4055-8df8-754255b7e1b1-2
01:04:44.322 --> 01:04:45.680
bird, of course.

64bbf69c-a105-454e-a2fe-b646032580e3-0
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.590
They are headed for.

53761f74-4a37-48a5-b6d2-7bffb7ed1494-0
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:56.600
A building, uh, kind of a Greek
building that is illuminated.

53761f74-4a37-48a5-b6d2-7bffb7ed1494-1
01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.360
There's that. That's where the
action is.

0e6f415e-b014-4bd4-bc35-6e5257207723-0
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:08.350
Are underwater and uh, they get
to this amphitheater. What it

0e6f415e-b014-4bd4-bc35-6e5257207723-1
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:10.410
like the Parthenon.

a26a23df-4fed-4d27-9a05-1c9672209a76-0
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:15.760
And in the center is a pool.

11d9ccad-8586-4c2a-8d1e-59aadc3f6531-0
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.930
With a.

8f0fc62e-8eaf-49a0-883d-f407a7a0c072-0
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:23.140
Discarded by look like
seahorses.

e86f8378-7c02-4a95-a7b2-38fcff585263-0
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:30.725
And they have their diving
helmets on and their fit, their

e86f8378-7c02-4a95-a7b2-38fcff585263-1
01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:35.761
scuba, their flippers rather,
but they are able to move

e86f8378-7c02-4a95-a7b2-38fcff585263-2
01:05:35.761 --> 01:05:37.470
quickly underwater.

4932ac36-cf19-4e26-ad59-6b52895de94c-0
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:38.920
The.

33679309-9561-429d-87fe-6ce11a4e472b-0
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:45.480
The people who are against them
come after them and they too

33679309-9561-429d-87fe-6ce11a4e472b-1
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:50.104
have Spears and flippers on
them, so our roads are going to

33679309-9561-429d-87fe-6ce11a4e472b-2
01:05:50.104 --> 01:05:54.882
have to move quickly and they're
able to do that because they

33679309-9561-429d-87fe-6ce11a4e472b-3
01:05:54.882 --> 01:05:59.429
have fins and of course the
magic bird and the octopus who

33679309-9561-429d-87fe-6ce11a4e472b-4
01:05:59.429 --> 01:06:01.509
is there to transport them.

f69d6ffa-8a31-4a74-b827-75f611dd2028-0
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.308
OK, they get out of the water
and land on this tropical island

f69d6ffa-8a31-4a74-b827-75f611dd2028-1
01:06:09.308 --> 01:06:14.603
where the bird is flying, and
they are now going to make for

f69d6ffa-8a31-4a74-b827-75f611dd2028-2
01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:19.725
themselves what they need to
succeed in this venture using

f69d6ffa-8a31-4a74-b827-75f611dd2028-3
01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:22.849
their purple and their red
pencils.

594b9d4c-88a8-41e0-a3f8-caa917751492-0
01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.093
OK, now they've got a
rhinoceros, a purple rhinoceros,

594b9d4c-88a8-41e0-a3f8-caa917751492-1
01:06:29.093 --> 01:06:31.150
and they've got a a red.

e1d78d90-e8d2-454d-af26-412a0defebd5-0
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.210
What do you call a seat?

658989b3-bbba-4aea-8aea-95b384c70c7e-0
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:45.228
Ohh, can't think of the word
anyway. You would use it to ride

658989b3-bbba-4aea-8aea-95b384c70c7e-1
01:06:45.228 --> 01:06:51.582
on a rhinoceros if you have one.
Or an elephant and they are

658989b3-bbba-4aea-8aea-95b384c70c7e-2
01:06:51.582 --> 01:06:57.936
going down a path to the city.
Looks like Machu Picchu, some

658989b3-bbba-4aea-8aea-95b384c70c7e-3
01:06:57.936 --> 01:07:04.707
old city and bird is with them,
so they're clearly going to have

658989b3-bbba-4aea-8aea-95b384c70c7e-4
01:07:04.707 --> 01:07:07.520
an adventure here and then.

9dc6a857-307c-4ee7-a201-9f6cc9a638a3-0
01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.530
Speed from a distance.

333e482a-e4cb-498a-8842-d71f9497c40e-0
01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.470
That there is a suspension
bridge that goes out to a

333e482a-e4cb-498a-8842-d71f9497c40e-1
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:20.893
citadel with a life at the top
of it. This is clearly where the

333e482a-e4cb-498a-8842-d71f9497c40e-2
01:07:20.893 --> 01:07:26.061
king would be reside if he were
there, so maybe that's where

333e482a-e4cb-498a-8842-d71f9497c40e-3
01:07:26.061 --> 01:07:30.975
they're going to try to find
themselves. It's hard to see

333e482a-e4cb-498a-8842-d71f9497c40e-4
01:07:30.975 --> 01:07:36.143
what's on the this other part,
whether those are warriors or

333e482a-e4cb-498a-8842-d71f9497c40e-5
01:07:36.143 --> 01:07:37.330
what they are.

28cd1c21-3d7c-4c94-8af3-14e9570c581a-0
01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.951
OK, here we are. They are now.
They've gotten up on this

28cd1c21-3d7c-4c94-8af3-14e9570c581a-1
01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:48.325
suspension bridge and they're
going out to the tower with the

28cd1c21-3d7c-4c94-8af3-14e9570c581a-2
01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:52.699
light and the bird is with them.
They do that in a big hurry.

37fdd35b-2207-4bc3-8cee-16e5acee1f49-0
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:59.160
They've got the they're, they're
going from their tropical area.

37fdd35b-2207-4bc3-8cee-16e5acee1f49-1
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.881
Hard to say if there are people
over there, can't can't help

37fdd35b-2207-4bc3-8cee-16e5acee1f49-2
01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:06.900
anyway, so they're going across
there.

e9bb73dd-d065-4cfc-9ba5-a2e33fc312e6-0
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:12.971
It was just a suspension bridge
like that in India that broke

e9bb73dd-d065-4cfc-9ba5-a2e33fc312e6-1
01:08:12.971 --> 01:08:16.760
and killed a number of people
and 50 people on the bridge.

2b7a1a7d-3d07-4558-b146-9c4e7505b035-0
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:22.910
{Do you love that? No. Yeah. It
was a suspension bridge just

2b7a1a7d-3d07-4558-b146-9c4e7505b035-1
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:27.910
like that. And it just opened it
again. And when they did or.}

256e5fd0-9b2d-4b73-9b05-a1b9cfc6f88f-0
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.203
{People fell under the water, of
course. I think seven people

256e5fd0-9b2d-4b73-9b05-a1b9cfc6f88f-1
01:08:32.203 --> 01:08:32.800
were killed.}

2d90a715-3936-4951-a8d4-2c187bcbc107-0
01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.751
So now they have arrived at the
at the tower and they're on top

2d90a715-3936-4951-a8d4-2c187bcbc107-1
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:47.804
of it with the bird and out of
here come the the minions may

2d90a715-3936-4951-a8d4-2c187bcbc107-2
01:08:47.804 --> 01:08:52.269
take out their magic pencils and
are making.

458cd380-15bd-4b4c-807a-88f82a04de9c-0
01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:57.505
Something that is going to
transport them where they are

458cd380-15bd-4b4c-807a-88f82a04de9c-1
01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:57.770
not.

d40f7858-f595-4136-af26-f4484198b82f-0
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:04.955
The bird there? Yeah. Ohh it's a
swing. OK. They're getting away

d40f7858-f595-4136-af26-f4484198b82f-1
01:09:04.955 --> 01:09:10.334
with the bird is taking them
away on their magic swing and

d40f7858-f595-4136-af26-f4484198b82f-2
01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:16.078
taking them to the mountains and
they have escaped their these

d40f7858-f595-4136-af26-f4484198b82f-3
01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:19.360
people who are trying to hurt
them.

daa4e59b-d82b-4cee-bd83-d404ddbdcf25-0
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.507
They are landing on a in a
temple, looks as if it's a

daa4e59b-d82b-4cee-bd83-d404ddbdcf25-1
01:09:28.507 --> 01:09:34.027
Buddhist temple, maybe Nepal or
Tibet or someplace, and their

daa4e59b-d82b-4cee-bd83-d404ddbdcf25-2
01:09:34.027 --> 01:09:38.390
bird deposits them on top of
this and here come.

2ee9cb60-619b-4d91-86de-6fad6ed078f4-0
01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:42.200
Villains and their dirigibles.

d0deaaf4-4293-4f90-b76d-5c14d7f89aa0-0
01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:45.240
After them.

98690f8b-93ce-48b9-9f83-afa94678c17e-0
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.730
Well, they are now. Have a
rainbow.

28ff3b44-75d6-4854-a0c9-c82edae306d9-0
01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:58.728
Instrument here. That bird is
going to seize on, and let's see

28ff3b44-75d6-4854-a0c9-c82edae306d9-1
01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.090
where they go from here.

56151f78-f67d-478f-afa4-d70c25e82a1a-0
01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:11.536
And here come the the people who
are out after them, and the bird

56151f78-f67d-478f-afa4-d70c25e82a1a-1
01:10:11.536 --> 01:10:12.960
is going to.

7e98d77d-ef38-44cf-9c9c-826e7cde17fa-0
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.150
What happened?

fe868ef4-f81c-4182-9a2d-a45bad42d128-0
01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:23.335
Trying to get the bird but
didn't happen. And so oh, they

fe868ef4-f81c-4182-9a2d-a45bad42d128-1
01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:27.430
take their rainbow and they make
a rainbow to escape on.

823a39e5-9bdb-4189-aff3-f9f5a285b300-0
01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:32.503
And the bird? The bird draws the
rainbow out across the sky, and

823a39e5-9bdb-4189-aff3-f9f5a285b300-1
01:10:32.503 --> 01:10:34.580
they have a bridge to get away.

b30289c9-4169-4723-a0dd-2b085bbb59f1-0
01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:40.960
And the villains are falling
from the sky they have been.

0c8135e9-bd13-49bb-839b-d5d70cafd8eb-0
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:48.190
They have been squelched by this
rainbow, which is emitting all

0c8135e9-bd13-49bb-839b-d5d70cafd8eb-1
01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.540
kinds of light.

2922ff83-63cd-4f09-a2f9-4dab42aa1fca-0
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:53.760
And here.

3fdc84d6-27ab-40e9-a195-1adbc76a89df-0
01:10:54.790 --> 01:11:03.180
That rainbow is destroying the
bad people in their boat and.

e1849f5b-a417-42ad-b54f-0d223e48167a-0
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:11.034
By drowning them. And the king
is very, very happy to see this

e1849f5b-a417-42ad-b54f-0d223e48167a-1
01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:13.170
rainbow and his saviors.

a5c43eb4-45b0-493f-86d0-1b2b97695c1f-0
01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.740
And now that the rainbow is
there in the city, the city is

a5c43eb4-45b0-493f-86d0-1b2b97695c1f-1
01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:28.931
illuminated. It is no longer
dead looking. The other houses

a5c43eb4-45b0-493f-86d0-1b2b97695c1f-2
01:11:28.931 --> 01:11:33.471
are swimming around in this pool
where there are people are very

a5c43eb4-45b0-493f-86d0-1b2b97695c1f-3
01:11:33.471 --> 01:11:34.030
happily.

d1ba80ad-a75b-45a0-9a75-6dfdd7c1fa8c-0
01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:41.400
Living and doing what they're

and the kids and the king are
entering the city and waving to

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:51.280
everybody, and the bird is there
too, and everybody's happy.

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:59.440
Now they are sending to the
city.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.683
And on the river, and they have
vanquished their enemies

d11970f8-acac-49ce-ab23-051e6494c9b1-1
01:12:06.683 --> 01:12:11.802
afterwards. The king who is
putting the crown on the little

d11970f8-acac-49ce-ab23-051e6494c9b1-2
01:12:11.802 --> 01:12:14.960

over.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:21.945
And the bird is there. The
little girl leaves, and the king

aafe82e7-6b46-4898-9a23-6afac1f64536-1
01:12:21.945 --> 01:12:26.150
is saluting the new Prince, the
new king.

db39bf26-bae0-4006-b7b2-ef14aaa6d674-0
01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:34.420

girl with both got crowns on.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.618
And they are looking at the city
that belongs to them, and with

01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:46.085
the rainbow connecting
everything and the bird with

mountains around it, and it
looks like a Big Lake and people

277b31d7-dd38-4b17-bac8-133aec56211b-2
01:13:14.893 --> 01:13:20.416

got some igloos here, so part of

as if they're not frozen,

In a way and a a uh dock or a
float rather out in the middle

it's called, but they go up and

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.940

01:14:59.513 --> 01:15:01.040

wouldn't know there are any

01:15:06.662 --> 01:15:10.111
Penguins in here. I I see one
now that I'm looking. I see one

01:15:45.729 --> 01:15:51.531
have a street that looks back in

cf413b8f-d18c-4759-a833-1012b02624d6-2
01:15:51.531 --> 01:15:55.430
in a foreign city, at least
foreign to me.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.420

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.980
There is a man with a cart with
some kind of a heater in it, and

8245c7c0-a984-44c5-bb87-5855165ad8d8-1
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:15.208
he has a dragon carrying a
dragon and a basket on it, and

8245c7c0-a984-44c5-bb87-5855165ad8d8-2
01:16:15.208 --> 01:16:21.330
he has another something that he
is holding by the neck.

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:27.111
Hard to tell what it is. And
then another man and a woman

90a3f2f8-5d58-4563-b013-68910eb42844-1
01:16:27.111 --> 01:16:31.473
with some gigantic eggs that
have in a basket and there's

90a3f2f8-5d58-4563-b013-68910eb42844-2
01:16:31.473 --> 01:16:35.909
something else in a basket.
These must be tradespeople who

90a3f2f8-5d58-4563-b013-68910eb42844-3
01:16:35.909 --> 01:16:40.797
are selling these things on the
street and on the street reading

90a3f2f8-5d58-4563-b013-68910eb42844-4
01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:41.699
a newspaper.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.230
We have a Barber.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:53.221
Uh and a snail waiting to uh, or
on the floor of the barbershop.

5c5d37a3-9513-4e19-9ec2-5a44a35943a7-1
01:16:53.221 --> 01:16:58.655
He must be picking up things off
the floor. Here's the man on the

5c5d37a3-9513-4e19-9ec2-5a44a35943a7-2
01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:00.220

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.590
Like an accordion and another
violinist. So they are making

c62bf198-70f7-4176-a3e7-d457e1f73815-1
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:11.216
music on the street and there
are some various bird like

c62bf198-70f7-4176-a3e7-d457e1f73815-2
01:17:11.216 --> 01:17:15.600
creatures who are hopping
around, maybe like pigeons.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:23.199
And then we have some people in
an area with signs on it, one

938220db-e4a7-487f-a450-47cdb9ab6f5a-1
01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:28.557
person carrying rabbit and
another person knitting and

938220db-e4a7-487f-a450-47cdb9ab6f5a-2
01:17:28.557 --> 01:17:34.110
another person reading the book.
So they are apparently.

6bdfb0b3-97e3-4d69-ac7c-634f71147fa2-0
01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.786
And there's something in the
basket here. Looks like maybe a

6bdfb0b3-97e3-4d69-ac7c-634f71147fa2-1
01:17:39.786 --> 01:17:43.738
monkey. And then we have our
man. This is our guy who left

6bdfb0b3-97e3-4d69-ac7c-634f71147fa2-2
01:17:43.738 --> 01:17:47.958
home with his hat on, and he's
wondering and with his suitcase

6bdfb0b3-97e3-4d69-ac7c-634f71147fa2-3
01:17:47.958 --> 01:17:50.370
and he's wondering which way to
go.

f68560ea-b3e8-40c1-a0a4-715b5c7f6ba1-0
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.870
And now he is consulting.

be38e648-a6fe-4232-bb81-a8707fbaaa21-0
01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.590
Say uh.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:09.846
Mirror. A clock. A a clock,
maybe? And looking at a tower

31c875b6-cbd6-4f0d-9da1-3844c370385f-1
01:18:09.846 --> 01:18:16.312
and walking across with his
suitcase looks a little bit

31c875b6-cbd6-4f0d-9da1-3844c370385f-2
01:18:16.312 --> 01:18:20.700
lost. He's looking up, and there
are.

ef9c4fc2-e880-474d-b39b-b5c3700e572f-0
01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:25.726
Lights have come crawling
through the air. Will they

ef9c4fc2-e880-474d-b39b-b5c3700e572f-1
01:18:25.726 --> 01:18:30.573
become like a Blizzard of lights
and taking his hat off? There

ef9c4fc2-e880-474d-b39b-b5c3700e572f-2
01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:32.650
must be quite a wind there.

5d7f8dcb-3043-48b0-94cb-7a5a0614f6dd-0
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:40.078
Then he loses his hat, but picks
it up, puts it back on, and he

5d7f8dcb-3043-48b0-94cb-7a5a0614f6dd-1
01:18:40.078 --> 01:18:46.032
sees a map that apparently is
going to tell him where he needs

5d7f8dcb-3043-48b0-94cb-7a5a0614f6dd-2
01:18:46.032 --> 01:18:51.325
to be. It's a book, actually,
and he picks it up and is

5d7f8dcb-3043-48b0-94cb-7a5a0614f6dd-3
01:18:51.325 --> 01:18:56.428
reading it, and along comes
somebody who looks like a

5d7f8dcb-3043-48b0-94cb-7a5a0614f6dd-4
01:18:56.428 --> 01:18:57.090
native.

321d26be-f1aa-42ca-b7dc-eb2d01de48ef-0
01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:04.322
And he is talking to this man
and has his hand out asking for

321d26be-f1aa-42ca-b7dc-eb2d01de48ef-1
01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:05.150
something.

68daffa9-f123-42a8-8e49-c331c971e372-0
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:11.374
And the man is talking with this
guy, and the guy talks back with

68daffa9-f123-42a8-8e49-c331c971e372-1
01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:16.132
him. They're conversing. And the
man is asking him where there

68daffa9-f123-42a8-8e49-c331c971e372-2
01:19:16.132 --> 01:19:18.700
might be a place for him to
stay.

045236ad-56ff-4095-ab28-bca499bd9946-0
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:25.991
