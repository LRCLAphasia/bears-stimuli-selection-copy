details. There are two men on

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.760
Maybe typing a letter on an old
typewriter and a man?

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.752

and he's got his plate and he's

telephone and a man wash.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.747

maybe. Ohh there's more over

around the yard.

b998ffed-7117-47e2-8ff8-1d171283cfdb-0
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.806

Man on the roof of his building
looks like he came out the

Looks like there was an
accident.

On the ground looks like they
were riding bicycles.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.034
A nurse might be arriving, and a
doctor or some kind of medic.

a725aa0b-1195-4eaa-bb5e-a73b20220488-1
00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:38.880

crossing guard.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.180
Hmm, well, the man has presented
the box to his wife.

2946fe54-d68e-4216-8017-de2d3a2c5262-0
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.250
It is a trunk wrapped with the
belt

aee254f7-977b-4ac4-a065-739a6ffbd8cb-0
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.720
Presumably that frame is inside.
He's put it on the kitchen

aee254f7-977b-4ac4-a065-739a6ffbd8cb-1
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.968
table, where there are two cups
and saucers and a teapot with a

aee254f7-977b-4ac4-a065-739a6ffbd8cb-2
00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:12.460
crack.

66a97574-7ddb-48a8-bf04-2440fd0dbd1d-0
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.200
And a.

17cc02f0-102a-4fad-9c18-71a2f4f92c1d-0
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.615
Bird it looks like folded paper
and a cloth and some little

17cc02f0-102a-4fad-9c18-71a2f4f92c1d-1
00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:26.581
bottles, and there's a towel
hanging behind them, and a hat

17cc02f0-102a-4fad-9c18-71a2f4f92c1d-2
00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:30.140
next to that, and a little
drawing on the.

9d1457b6-5d4a-45a4-8e15-5526438a1ca5-0
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.250
On the wall behind them.

fbdef6b4-1ea9-4a79-ad6e-3cee6494f03a-0
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.967
Looks like a child's drawing of
their mother, father and

fbdef6b4-1ea9-4a79-ad6e-3cee6494f03a-1
00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:43.381
themselves, with a bird on the
man's arm and the sun shining,

fbdef6b4-1ea9-4a79-ad6e-3cee6494f03a-2
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:45.090
there's a pot and spoon.

0ccd7c0e-7bda-4e43-8be6-32c5cd57d5ac-0
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.430
There's some papers under the
one of the cups.

eff5a053-b9f4-46fd-b61d-e052752eecce-0
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.527
I guess maybe they're opening,
going to open that trunk because

eff5a053-b9f4-46fd-b61d-e052752eecce-1
00:07:57.527 --> 00:07:59.320
now we see the inside of it.

1c15e7f0-9322-4afb-95b3-0ac8015a4dfc-0
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.720
A blanket, perhaps?

01c7c0d4-4e4e-4422-a591-6fe47f6d9468-0
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.120
And the three people?

1cf07fdb-858e-49f0-9154-205b39ede6df-0
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.200
Then there's chairs. That's
about it.

5bf259a0-2360-4b11-b6c6-bd34a46f2f41-0
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.070


b6f4de4c-5ab0-4d69-8174-182dda624546-0
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.880
OK, so the little girl.

4543b8c9-266e-422f-9bf3-aa52f95a7a41-0
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.630
Was sleeping.

053db602-ccd3-49c6-a863-20f4f9ac4c5c-0
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.457
In her bed, under covers. But
now she's opened her eyes and

053db602-ccd3-49c6-a863-20f4f9ac4c5c-1
00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:27.680
she sat up, rubbed her eyes,
yawning.

2af2f07a-3ab4-4bd1-952c-e280a531b7a1-0
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.750
Looks like she's gone downstairs
for breakfast.

5ae96050-675a-4f21-98d9-e3d6862dc229-0
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.653
She has a bowl and a spoon and
she looks and she sees the

5ae96050-675a-4f21-98d9-e3d6862dc229-1
00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:38.230
suitcase.

bf016a1f-a399-44ee-8eec-bb7d4e2f8daf-0
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.635
Meanwhile, you see her father
with his hat and the mother with

bf016a1f-a399-44ee-8eec-bb7d4e2f8daf-1
00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:47.240
her scarf.

102ed434-fdcb-4106-ac8e-1df82e9ddeba-0
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.640
There's maybe getting ready to
go out because she's zipping up

102ed434-fdcb-4106-ac8e-1df82e9ddeba-1
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.746
the girl's coat and the girls
putting on her hat. Someone's

102ed434-fdcb-4106-ac8e-1df82e9ddeba-2
00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:58.320
putting on their boots.

e6738344-fedb-4620-9748-cc4dea2c22aa-0
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.360
And oh the girls picking up the
suitcase.

d6226f72-ed62-4f35-9cf2-9a385f4ae433-0
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.410
Father might have been saying.

6a86f8be-323a-4304-b274-984a5828df02-0
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.038
OK, I I'll take that. That's
heavy. And out they go, out the

6a86f8be-323a-4304-b274-984a5828df02-1
00:09:13.038 --> 00:09:15.480
door, down the steps and they're
walking away.

3ef150de-8bd3-427d-837a-e29ab2885c56-0
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.150
There's a big shadow of a.

ee29a3ce-1726-4b42-8ad6-07ff15b48047-0
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.190
Dragon on that building.

cdfa2526-41cd-4073-8011-10cba30b5355-0
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.820
Well, looks like they were going
to the train station.

7f0d3657-aa7b-4d12-b896-bc8b269c7351-0
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.728
The girls looking around, she's
just still got her hat and she's

7f0d3657-aa7b-4d12-b896-bc8b269c7351-1
00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:43.810
holding her father's hand,
trying to take it all in.

66aacfe9-2409-4e28-a825-ba8cd2c80e39-0
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.240
There's a lot of people there
standing with their suitcases.

9ad77625-4609-4b95-8b21-efc19ba25d28-0
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.430
Waiting for the train which is
arriving and there's steam

9ad77625-4609-4b95-8b21-efc19ba25d28-1
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.760
coming out of the top of the
engine.

f498960a-3fb6-4e42-973d-9678115bdd7f-0
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.090
And.

9b9d7130-e8c8-40ba-a11b-75670692c4f3-0
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.949
Everyone looks a little sad. The
man has that little paper bird

9b9d7130-e8c8-40ba-a11b-75670692c4f3-1
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:07.820
under his hat.

4a8066c0-ddc6-4a50-af7f-a5d2b6c48037-0
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.698
But his hand on the girl's
shoulder, trying to comfort her

4a8066c0-ddc6-4a50-af7f-a5d2b6c48037-1
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:12.750
and gives her the bird.

fc603bd5-4a5f-466b-99af-87aa1c6028c8-0
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.670
Gives her a hug. Mother's
crying.

3b69586c-2258-4baa-9212-e5d63581a7c2-0
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:23.232
The mother hugs the father and
the man is takes the suitcase

3b69586c-2258-4baa-9212-e5d63581a7c2-1
00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:25.210
and gets on the train.

82656802-ed5d-427a-be30-15191ae10b57-0
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.000
All three of them hold hands.

dacec52c-08a8-484a-840f-5ce7d1f18f26-0
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.408
Then he off goes, the train
takes off, you can't see it

dacec52c-08a8-484a-840f-5ce7d1f18f26-1
00:10:36.408 --> 00:10:37.080
anymore.

cc73a961-85a0-41f6-94b4-88d818decb2c-0
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.280
Uh.

26e90344-a9fc-4470-a0c8-7a784cf985a7-0
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.345
We've seen this before, so
there's the photo again, looks

26e90344-a9fc-4470-a0c8-7a784cf985a7-1
00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:47.760
like.

3d173136-ebd8-4a2c-a68a-8a693222c2fb-0
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.080
He opened the suitcase because.

a249c77f-bb4d-4059-88b8-87073ded41ac-0
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.610
The photos there on the trunk
while he's eating his.

512a8adc-0a2d-4d88-8544-d995ae757945-0
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.180
Soup in a bowl with a spoon is
sitting.

205861d2-c8a2-46b0-ba13-f55f43502731-0
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.310
And the chair?

443e26df-b1cf-43b3-8e05-454db850d36c-0
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.060
Assume it's a chair. It's got a
shirt and a vest.

53692395-4250-4390-86ca-15e4e27a2255-0
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.920
And.

f6096791-db9b-49e3-ae1b-769628bc9ce2-0
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.430
Soon we see him through a
porthole.

99cb216e-25bb-402c-9f01-7a638a998c7b-0
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.941
And then we back away and the
portholes lot smaller, and now

99cb216e-25bb-402c-9f01-7a638a998c7b-1
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:22.630
we see several portholes.

071a0ef4-8cfe-4ec8-9cee-0fc0735b8809-0
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.940
And now we see many, many
portholes. And we realize that.

d6d3e640-3bd8-40df-b91e-e709873bca51-0
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.114
#END_arrival-1 That man is on
the ship, along with other

d6d3e640-3bd8-40df-b91e-e709873bca51-1
00:11:32.114 --> 00:11:32.490
people.

e403d634-cb46-4a85-96c3-bea79d2911d6-0
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.956
{And that was it. So that was
it. OK, we've seen that one

e403d634-cb46-4a85-96c3-bea79d2911d6-1
00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:40.570
before.}

4f8132b8-e0b6-4933-9b1a-6bec27e497ad-0
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.300
{There's different parts of a
big story, so each is a self.}

8650e969-56b3-4493-8225-fc0a6bab33d3-0
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.760
{Self containing parts.}

7496cee6-a67c-4f0e-8cd7-71ed19c42cfe-0
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.400
{OK, going well.}

4177b734-c5a3-4bf2-a0f6-23015b48c6b5-0
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.680
{The next part Ohh.}

63315e6d-ce4f-443b-bc15-32989b374697-0
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.910
{Hey.}

5f3df8ca-6684-4422-9e0e-6f62473149d5-0
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.535
#START_arrival-3 OK oh, the man
is still there. OK, well now

5f3df8ca-6684-4422-9e0e-6f62473149d5-1
00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:09.010
we're on the street.

cff4653c-7098-4209-8da8-a6369032c473-0
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:15.525
And there's a boy with a cap and
a papers under his arm, and he's

cff4653c-7098-4209-8da8-a6369032c473-1
00:12:15.525 --> 00:12:20.864
holding a large poster that says
something on it. And there's a

cff4653c-7098-4209-8da8-a6369032c473-2
00:12:20.864 --> 00:12:25.870
man behind him with a hat and
he's got some smaller papers.

e1af3bc8-0c95-4c8f-b339-993b020a6c8e-0
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.336
And there's a woman nearby
holding an odd cat with a long

e1af3bc8-0c95-4c8f-b339-993b020a6c8e-1
00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:31.730
tail.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.400
And there's another man.

b9e63711-1af2-41ba-9560-c87bee84c9cc-0
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.880
With the food cart looks like a
food cart.

1051c40e-35ba-4e85-90b8-f93c35f2adcc-0
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.193
With four wheels and he's
getting something out of the

1051c40e-35ba-4e85-90b8-f93c35f2adcc-1
00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:51.190
cart and there's an animal in a
basket in front of his car.

5d17f82e-ebcf-4290-8971-f774ff182647-0
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.700
And there's.

5d3ee784-3e6e-4531-9a02-5f4712635773-0
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.955
Wooden box, another frame, a
wooden box, and a man and a

5d3ee784-3e6e-4531-9a02-5f4712635773-1
00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.060
woman carefully.

6580bd12-ab08-4150-a412-76a54b2d9300-0
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:06.643
Either taking out or putting
these very large eggs into it.

6580bd12-ab08-4150-a412-76a54b2d9300-1
00:13:06.643 --> 00:13:10.350
There's a cactus nearby. There's
also.

fd1b9f0b-96b4-4aef-9391-a755b706a022-0
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.467
Barber is shaving someone at the
moment and a small young boy is

fd1b9f0b-96b4-4aef-9391-a755b706a022-1
00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:19.500
behind watching. They all have
hats.

d3c1161f-35e7-4d06-8446-8008a23e18bb-0
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.630
Umm.

f71dfcd0-9b16-49f4-8a6b-7dea79aab935-0
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.010
There's snails on the ground.

cac6244e-5c21-4df6-a4e8-01f95f62400f-0
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.690
And then there's a man.

2d083854-108c-4b11-a771-70ecd956fcd7-0
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.140
With an accordion with a big.

a9aaa730-c187-4ed5-93ed-414b24881330-0
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.807
horn coming out of it and
another man playing a violin.

a9aaa730-c187-4ed5-93ed-414b24881330-1
00:13:38.807 --> 00:13:39.910
The music stand.

3da6ff83-8f02-4b4a-9876-b3ad61e3110d-0
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.480
And there's.

a4dba0f9-fc84-485c-87ef-291e96dcc214-0
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.110
Mouse like birds on the ground.

8f60ce46-c7ec-436f-834a-1c0eb3d51b44-0
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.880
And there's a bunch of women
looking at.

39016002-ebe2-4d86-abcc-e23ed1bf4e54-0
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.821
A magazine. One woman's looking
at the magazine and all the

39016002-ebe2-4d86-abcc-e23ed1bf4e54-1
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:01.789
other women are looking at her.
One woman has a rabbit big ears,

39016002-ebe2-4d86-abcc-e23ed1bf4e54-2
00:14:01.789 --> 00:14:03.620
and another woman is knitting.

99c29a2d-d615-47a8-96ad-b44a788507a6-0
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.112
The man is just looking at all
this as he stands there with his

99c29a2d-d615-47a8-96ad-b44a788507a6-1
00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:12.720
suitcase.

a117f31f-ad68-4b83-8f0b-ba9a9e268c08-0
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.250
When he opens his.

e7ff24fe-3b1f-4c12-afda-2ffd02251421-0
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.640
Watch or his compass.

e9d9c8c0-650d-47ea-82f4-44c31a6e63b3-0
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.423
He's trying to figure out either
what direction to go or what

e9d9c8c0-650d-47ea-82f4-44c31a6e63b3-1
00:14:36.423 --> 00:14:39.470
time it is, and he looks a
little confused.

c3c98679-615a-49b7-96d2-860def3aaa22-0
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.360
Or frightened, he looks up at a
building.

2cdb9fe4-634e-4471-a97f-31daed723be6-0
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.440
And.

fdaee047-49fa-4886-99f7-3a63765bc19f-0
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.392
And there's a beautiful design
on it. Not sure it keeps walking

fdaee047-49fa-4886-99f7-3a63765bc19f-1
00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:55.920
through the town.

ec2ae376-eff1-4e9d-a85d-fe64f89c8289-0
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.790
With this suitcase.

d807b78d-4d8d-4773-83bf-10f87696c6da-0
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.930
And he see some little lights?

a1c26850-4d74-4bd9-b3ac-b562c0ec05c0-0
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.240
Those little lights.

4fe893d6-4bed-4ba2-bfe0-000986119e06-0
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.830
Bigger and bigger.

7e2d4aba-715c-498c-ad50-fb370c702e81-0
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.170
And then they start moving.

678f84fa-7f51-46cd-b8cd-5ca0dbe72a70-0
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.590
And the wind starts blowing, so
they start moving. It blows his

678f84fa-7f51-46cd-b8cd-5ca0dbe72a70-1
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:24.040
hat off. His hat lands on the
ground and he goes to pick it up

678f84fa-7f51-46cd-b8cd-5ca0dbe72a70-2
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.279
and when he picks it up to put
it on his head, he sees some

678f84fa-7f51-46cd-b8cd-5ca0dbe72a70-3
00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:32.375
arrows and he thinks maybe this
is something I should pay

678f84fa-7f51-46cd-b8cd-5ca0dbe72a70-4
00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:33.930
attention to the book.

3abb2468-6c93-4ae7-bf27-e3c1ee7847d9-0
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.028
No, it's not a book. It was on
the ground, but now he has a

3abb2468-6c93-4ae7-bf27-e3c1ee7847d9-1
00:15:39.028 --> 00:15:41.620
book that he got from somewhere
and he.

4254c5e0-0072-4e6d-9678-cbcafec0f35a-0
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.096
Tries to interpret what those
symbols were on the ground, and

4254c5e0-0072-4e6d-9678-cbcafec0f35a-1
00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:47.780
he asks a

44403a07-d045-4441-8a15-8ccad87286aa-0
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.260
Man.

4b8a8dfe-14d8-4175-a3f5-8da50b98e87b-0
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.320
Can you help me understand what
this means?

f5b8606c-cab4-4686-97d2-edfbafe991b1-0
00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:02.680
the Man says sure and the man
has a hat. They both have hats.

8d8b4af3-57ca-4c4a-8703-216e7a66fbe9-0
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.580
He says.

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-0
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.064
What exactly do you want to
know? And the man tells him

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-1
00:16:15.064 --> 00:16:19.302
something like, I'm trying to
tell him something, but he

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-2
00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:23.838
doesn't understand. So he draws
a picture of a of a bed. I'm

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-3
00:16:23.838 --> 00:16:28.449
looking for a place to sleep.
There's a bed and a window. Man

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-4
00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:33.208
says, oh, I see what you want. I
see. He puts his finger up and

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-5
00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:37.669
he says, and he points over
here, let's go this way. So the

f9309469-c3f1-40b9-9505-d7c0242574e5-6
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:40.569
man with the suitcase follows
the man.

a30bbfb4-5451-4c1c-a895-6b9899b11bd9-0
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.850
That helped him and he's got a
like an armadillo in a basket.

bb395d55-a8e5-48bc-8bb4-faa5e2a4d370-0
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.400
On his back.

0586a5af-62e8-4620-abc2-0c21c3ed11d7-0
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.710
#END_arrival-3 And off they go.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.224
{OK. So thank you for that part
of this story. OK. I've seen

pretty consistent.}

it exactly. Ohh, really. Yeah,

7dbaedf4-a79c-45c5-8725-92ef0128c661-1
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.500
I'll double check with that.}

the cannons has just been fired.

00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:23.733
smaller boats, like row boats,
and they're loaded with people

52c93617-e75e-4547-8705-8bc92dc2023e-2
00:19:23.733 --> 00:19:27.100

growing maybe.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.210
To the shore, because we can see
some land.

There's an octopus, a really big
octopus in the water. It's

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:44.580

not sure if he's trying to help.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.588
Definitely lots of pirate ships
because we can see the skull and

0fa3144c-f97b-4726-940e-05f582dc637b-1
00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:51.220
crossbones.

OK, now I'm going to the store.

3cdf8ebd-423f-4ec8-8fc7-18fd73cd0654-0
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:14.304
Looks like sand and sandy shore,
but there are a few palm trees.

3cdf8ebd-423f-4ec8-8fc7-18fd73cd0654-1
00:20:14.304 --> 00:20:16.600
There's many in the palm trees.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:25.702
And in the background there's a
grassy area and more trees up

c1c9d59a-6498-48fd-b549-ddcb1e1e9f9a-1
00:20:25.702 --> 00:20:26.200
high.

30c97b48-e6b1-4060-9a13-e58d8d363009-0
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.660
And.

040ea348-901d-46c4-8d78-161e2e07b7d3-0
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.550
There's some wave, you know,
it's not a wave. Yeah, there are

040ea348-901d-46c4-8d78-161e2e07b7d3-1
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.320
waves coming in.

14952b7c-b7d5-4b41-8a74-04ac4ea0dd5f-0
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.600
But there's people firing on.

57ab1b79-f904-448f-a76a-f5658a760968-0
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.640
The people on the shore, there's
a big hole, someone's.

d512d95a-78ca-487b-b363-67486dfa809a-0
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.180
digging

ea3899a9-2448-4c9e-8ede-ff79ceb06b71-0
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.210
I don't know if someone dug that
hole or.

f100e467-6d54-4841-8f6f-35c84e462ee0-0
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.700
Yeah, looks like they've dug a
hole.

a2706018-1b5a-4445-99e8-56f37b0753af-0
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.248
Oh, they're probably going to
bury the treasure. Yeah,

a2706018-1b5a-4445-99e8-56f37b0753af-1
00:20:52.248 --> 00:20:56.877
there's, there's the empty. It's
empty. They've just unburied it.

a2706018-1b5a-4445-99e8-56f37b0753af-2
00:20:56.877 --> 00:21:00.946
Probably they've just dug it up
and they opened it up and

a2706018-1b5a-4445-99e8-56f37b0753af-3
00:21:00.946 --> 00:21:02.700
there's nothing in there.

8fcb1534-053c-4658-85dc-23c443635b96-0
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.820
All that.

3563c0ef-7003-4df4-b3d8-7085386343d1-0

don't know. I really don't know.
OK, that's OK. It's been 3 to 4

00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:17.499
minutes, so OK.}

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.150
{OK.}

11f4a089-66e8-4001-ae20-eacdee1bdc89-0
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.290
#START_arrival-4 Well, this man
is just he's taking a shower. I

11f4a089-66e8-4001-ae20-eacdee1bdc89-1
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.590
don't know where he is, but he's
taking a shower and then he gets

11f4a089-66e8-4001-ae20-eacdee1bdc89-2
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.480
out of the shower. He shaves.

c00044fe-f1dc-440d-88be-aef07039a78e-0
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.780
And he gets dressed. He's
buttoning. He's already buttoned

c00044fe-f1dc-440d-88be-aef07039a78e-1
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.931
his shirt and now he's buttoning
his vest. Now he's tying his

c00044fe-f1dc-440d-88be-aef07039a78e-2
00:21:59.931 --> 00:22:02.810
shoe and he's getting some money
together.

ac665e72-acd3-44d3-b370-6992cef5a17b-0
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.870
I probably put it in his pocket
and he's grabbing his hat.

afaafa47-6aff-40c0-b568-62fa61a0ef1f-0
00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.780
now he gets out a map.

730fd925-b349-4b7b-9fdf-243387b055d3-0
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.863
And unfolds the map, and he
studies it. There's a funny

730fd925-b349-4b7b-9fdf-243387b055d3-1
00:22:16.863 --> 00:22:20.190
little fish nearby studying the
map.

a5362322-8a6c-4aba-839d-a997b3ed6e03-0
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.460
City.

5a842475-3d13-4025-856e-3232f1a11ab7-0
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.240
Heads off and the little fish
seems to be following him.

cf8644ce-51d2-44b5-90bf-8881161797ed-0
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.550
And he goes.

80a941a7-f714-4438-921b-d9179fdc5f61-0
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.120
Looks like he's maybe going to
get on the subway or something.

e5fde10c-d8f3-4cce-b600-bf1df0fe96a5-0
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.470
Umm.

28fd033a-f8b8-458b-9a49-f48d4af56af0-0
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.503
He's not quite sure where he
should go. He's standing there

28fd033a-f8b8-458b-9a49-f48d4af56af0-1
00:22:39.503 --> 00:22:42.515
and a lot of other people are
waiting also and behind them

28fd033a-f8b8-458b-9a49-f48d4af56af0-2
00:22:42.515 --> 00:22:42.719
are.

a6fa213a-8a9e-484a-be85-af718d0a5054-0
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:48.512
What looked like teepees, but
made of stone and a huge

a6fa213a-8a9e-484a-be85-af718d0a5054-1
00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:51.400
structure. A bridge and there's.

6f168a59-670a-410e-a7ea-88b252ca64dc-0
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.070
There's boats up in the air and
there's airplanes up in the air.

4673af15-9c11-4ae9-9a6c-f56baec2f925-0
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.580
Maybe we're underwater, but I
don't think so.

7ea08b8d-bf2c-4196-a153-0b1edbd55adf-0
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.540
{That's about it.}

6b3847cc-58ce-4624-8443-fbe54feac702-0
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.940
{Is that enough? I don't know
what else.}

17f2a534-aaa5-4613-a22a-0ac04ead233e-0
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.320
So he's waiting.

2e51708c-597d-4bcd-9c4c-487c6f6527f4-0
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:21.140
Next to a woman who's also
waiting in.

a09ea81d-a42f-4af1-b89f-5677c9b4090c-0
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.292
This little fish, or whatever it
is, starts to talk to her

a09ea81d-a42f-4af1-b89f-5677c9b4090c-1
00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:26.740
little.

553bf74c-88a8-49e4-ad22-2e06296d74f5-0
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.320
Bird.

8447286a-601b-4a63-bc2a-5e21bd3ae63d-0
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.978
The same time he starts to talk
to her. He's looking at his map

8447286a-601b-4a63-bc2a-5e21bd3ae63d-1
00:23:34.978 --> 00:23:37.460
and she's looking at a book and
they.

0c5f6d18-0017-419a-854d-d529220527cb-0
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.890
And she looks at his map, too.
And she.

41d0fbcb-d30e-4cb1-b03d-a51f1652dd8e-0
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.990
He points to something that he's
looking for.

f363edd3-4e84-4bb0-b2c6-ddff60c0284c-0
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.652
And she says, well, here points
to this thing that looks like a

f363edd3-4e84-4bb0-b2c6-ddff60c0284c-1
00:23:51.652 --> 00:23:53.470
telephone. Maybe try this.

6854708a-bb42-46e1-9855-86ef5f5d5e6a-0
00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:00.810
So they dial a number and pull a
lever.

bbd45b26-6ce8-4706-8b10-e9fca81f360e-0
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.910
And outcomes.

d84e2276-a521-4ea2-81f9-d6e75363b7e8-0
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.180
Sort of a ticket.

d3165c8c-f618-4107-af8a-fb6d4100a495-0
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.760
So now she says, here's your
ticket. She gives it to him.

94632734-3d0f-456b-b869-9ddd9072d7a7-0
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.860
Take that ticket.

76fb69e4-d7aa-4bce-a4bd-204d89bdb576-0
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.270
Then off you go so.

e36c69ab-8e7d-4ec5-afd9-3ec894b8b62e-0
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.670
I don't know if he got up on one
of those.

411ed953-9bc5-4269-bb45-259d5d9ab58f-0
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.650
One of those vehicles in the
sky.

3d8bd947-8982-4a0a-995d-ae0ed2b60519-0
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.849
Or if they're just waiting for
it to come in. But there's a lot

3d8bd947-8982-4a0a-995d-ae0ed2b60519-1
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:38.647
of people still standing there
pointing and looking at the

3d8bd947-8982-4a0a-995d-ae0ed2b60519-2
00:24:38.647 --> 00:24:40.450
vehicles in the Sky 1 lands.

672633ee-dd9a-4e95-a9f8-96f0dca57d28-0
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.560
And.

0d8ac7f0-2da6-4564-97f6-1a96528410bd-0
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.800
He gives.

d8a6a4d6-f560-42ab-95ad-1d53924ccd01-0
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.380
Someone the ticket maybe, and
the ticket gets punched.

644c121b-66de-4432-a457-4908ebf647c0-0
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.320
And.

3f99453d-310b-42dc-95df-3f62bc47d026-0
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:04.986
The man says come this way. Man
in coat with three stripes and a

3f99453d-310b-42dc-95df-3f62bc47d026-1
00:25:04.986 --> 00:25:07.360
hat and sunglasses and.

23f4d992-56b7-4133-9c54-b08aa8aa37d2-0
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.040
Looks like the fish is going to
go with him

99b7e73f-2d85-45cf-90fb-172af21c270b-0
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.040
So now they're on the.

e88fad20-3366-47f0-94f0-a612d0f9f851-0
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.040
Ship.

daaef2e8-da21-422b-90bf-ddeb13864f27-0
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.320
And he sits on a bench next to
the same woman.

f2363027-5586-466f-aefa-76a20ddda58f-0
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:30.319
And his fish climbs up next to
him and in the background we see

f2363027-5586-466f-aefa-76a20ddda58f-1
00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:34.960
a woman and with her baby, and
another man with a beard and.

6de964d5-1840-4060-9671-63ec2ae0a5ea-0
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.851
The man, the first man we saw
and the woman first woman we saw

6de964d5-1840-4060-9671-63ec2ae0a5ea-1
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:42.500
start talking and he starts
explaining.

b4bd212b-9a43-49b8-afdd-cb219291af5b-0
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:43.900
Hmm.

0d873f4b-a937-4fbe-8312-0433e9b2b8a9-0
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.320
starts explaining.

1ce435f1-3c88-419c-bcf2-44ef4eec6e79-0
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.370
Yeah.

24674122-2dd0-4eb4-9175-2093ed9b79ea-0
00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:02.533
That he's looking maybe for
someone. And she says, Oh well,

24674122-2dd0-4eb4-9175-2093ed9b79ea-1
00:26:02.533 --> 00:26:05.120
look, I'm looking for.

4ed136bb-6490-4a67-8d8a-d7e7140faac4-0
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.850
No, no, no.

55a05d58-f628-4229-a50d-3a67f91e89cb-0
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:16.530
He shows her his passport maybe,
and she shows him her passport.

4278fd9c-d2d2-40af-a68f-ced0b6603389-0
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.060
Now we're somewhere totally
different, she's remembering.

44f509b9-e459-49fe-936f-4022c96ade6d-0
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.195
The time when she was reading a
book and someone came and

44f509b9-e459-49fe-936f-4022c96ade6d-1
00:26:29.195 --> 00:26:33.840
grabbed her and took her book
and put it away and locked her.

5807647d-d8d1-4a82-b380-f1800d0e4fad-0
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.220
in a

1958634a-90ed-455e-8e67-806664f89cc9-0
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.220
Cold place.

10bb8bd0-ae77-4d81-b78c-0e58166f7b9b-0
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.680
And gave her a shovel.

4eab59e2-e998-4047-ad21-c9c3c6a0b4b1-0
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.940
And she just had to shovel.

f02ca8db-ff45-4fab-98c0-0455b127a31d-0
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.714
coal or something into a
furnace, and she did that for a

f02ca8db-ff45-4fab-98c0-0455b127a31d-1
00:26:50.714 --> 00:26:52.190
while until she.

cc792773-a9d7-4fad-b965-5b2bb9d86f1c-0
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.510
Found a ladder, and then she
climbed up the ladder.

97f9bc23-6771-4d43-85a0-6f83ba06411f-0
00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.270
To the top of the furnace.

4b201045-5e83-4d45-8e46-16142fe21772-0
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.830
And.

8a321ba9-53e4-4821-8c6e-eae0d1035245-0
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.460
Must have been hot, but somehow.

2deeda20-8f55-4257-bea0-8322e53f7ac2-0
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.500
She got to the very top and I'm
not sure what she's going to do.

55be85c9-1b3c-46f4-85ae-a1a996e0bcb2-0
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.687
She got to the very top and now
she can see other people in

55be85c9-1b3c-46f4-85ae-a1a996e0bcb2-1
00:27:19.687 --> 00:27:20.180
there.

3dade1ae-9c93-4021-8d73-2034961bb5f2-0
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.490
In their rooms, shoveling coal
into their furnaces.

ce399f01-13a8-4783-956b-bd5dae6b76f1-0
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.410
It's in a big building and there
must be.

78c572a7-977a-4280-9c54-d582bc23af89-0
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.540
Well, we can see at least 30
little rooms with people.

6f581d4e-5b54-46ea-9ca7-8f9acb0f6042-0
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.440
Big tall walls and lights and
she just.

fc185f87-b25f-4a22-90a5-56a5d83f3a26-0
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.955
Went back down, went back down
because, you know, she's sitting

fc185f87-b25f-4a22-90a5-56a5d83f3a26-1
00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:46.630
on the ground.

67906295-d69e-470f-a65c-cbf5fa890e7e-0
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.897
She tries something different.
She sticks her shovel in the

67906295-d69e-470f-a65c-cbf5fa890e7e-1
00:27:50.897 --> 00:27:52.140
door and she tries to.

f7ca9f99-da50-4fee-bd8b-f08b0ba1bf36-0
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.120
Open it that way.

f1e19a6c-e2a0-4468-8cb4-126a992a5799-0
00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.660
And she does get out, and she.

e32e35b8-0c97-4632-adff-40adb67d20e5-0
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.920
Somehow finds that drawer with
her book. Grabs her book.

dc361d45-ed6b-4362-9af6-66368a60fb0a-0
00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.740
And runs.

1956b175-2808-494f-887e-908e7600850b-0
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.670
Out of her.

3ba93f3e-be0a-46d8-98cd-253bdb3e8df3-0
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.380
Wherever she was held.

96546176-c005-481c-b17b-9f72f5cc1134-0
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.240
A large place and she climbs.

ff774612-704d-44bf-983e-8473c0b56b0b-0
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:28.050
Up into a window and sits with
her book looking out at oh.

a2389358-bd4a-42d5-a5a5-f43fed3037f9-0
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.851
She climbed into a train. I
guess She climbed into a train,

a2389358-bd4a-42d5-a5a5-f43fed3037f9-1
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:40.182
I didn't realize that. And she's
sitting there with her book,

a2389358-bd4a-42d5-a5a5-f43fed3037f9-2
00:28:40.182 --> 00:28:41.230
looking out as.

52711754-f0af-4f55-b1e0-78ffccb5eb89-0
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.700
Train is.

7acdde03-dd2c-4856-be87-7fe3476d5093-0
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.150
Going away.

d8d4123b-95b3-46a2-91ea-b7666f8746b1-0
00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:02.035
Well, I guess that's the ship
that the man and woman are in.

d8d4123b-95b3-46a2-91ea-b7666f8746b1-1
00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:06.918
Up inside, going by a big
billboard. Lots of buildings

d8d4123b-95b3-46a2-91ea-b7666f8746b1-2
00:29:06.918 --> 00:29:08.250
with domes and.

f22f5733-f07b-4019-a344-6c34b9fb1e7d-0
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:14.620
Designs, and she points out to
him something.

ef063dc6-5bb1-46e0-b2f5-f6c9abfc6374-0
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.773
While the man that took the
ticket has the megaphone and

ef063dc6-5bb1-46e0-b2f5-f6c9abfc6374-1
00:29:21.773 --> 00:29:24.950
he's calling, he's saying it's
time.

6e9f559c-75c5-4827-94cc-c1e6583b229a-0
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.930
To get off, perhaps and so
people.

26bea3e3-daf1-4c74-9776-38c2f38bca7d-0
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.833
Some people leave. Man's
leaving, says goodbye. Nice

26bea3e3-daf1-4c74-9776-38c2f38bca7d-1
00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:38.440
talking to you. She's got her.

7cc857ef-3b02-4370-9198-fbb11a974162-0
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.580
Cat, he's got his fish. He's
looking up.

528c7fed-1ff3-4ade-95f6-ebcea6ebd9d5-0
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.410
And he's walking down the
stairs.

1c558c51-78de-432a-9d75-8116908e30b0-0
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.470
There's a huge.

e5698930-ade7-4b71-a7d8-ddbc11073cd4-0
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.070
Sculpture of.

072c8dc0-38bf-40ab-a47d-8c24cbbb07bc-0
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.290
Of the.

915a5501-fb5d-48fd-a560-57794218d83d-0
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:17.730
{Come.}

21b457e1-a464-4395-8f36-a274283e3142-0
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:29.227
{OK. Is this where I want? Yes.
You were here with? Yeah, I was

21b457e1-a464-4395-8f36-a274283e3142-1
00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:34.505
just about done with that one. I
can see pretty well. Oh, good,

21b457e1-a464-4395-8f36-a274283e3142-2
00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:39.618
good. Yeah. So, OK, } so he saw
this really huge structure of

21b457e1-a464-4395-8f36-a274283e3142-3
00:30:39.618 --> 00:30:41.020
another creature.

fc47140a-6ed9-4fc4-9faa-4bd7fc627e81-0
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.900
{It's just what I forgot to
rename. Thank you.}

ea9e17ef-eb2f-48e5-b12a-4b8ad139466f-0
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.536
{OK, so I really didn't have too
much more to say about that one.

ea9e17ef-eb2f-48e5-b12a-4b8ad139466f-1
00:30:53.536 --> 00:30:57.103
} There was the large sculpture
that's kind of like a building

ea9e17ef-eb2f-48e5-b12a-4b8ad139466f-2
00:30:57.103 --> 00:31:00.443
he's looking, seems to be
looking at that. And there's two

ea9e17ef-eb2f-48e5-b12a-4b8ad139466f-3
00:31:00.443 --> 00:31:03.897
men walking up the stairs and it
looks like he's about to go

ea9e17ef-eb2f-48e5-b12a-4b8ad139466f-4
00:31:03.897 --> 00:31:04.520
downstairs.

730c3e4c-bf86-45f5-b76c-abee6ccd3c0e-0
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.130
{Ohh I don't really know what
else to say.}

9fc0ba69-3845-43cf-8510-ccb94dfb68ae-0
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.542
{Can you see that's OK? Yep,
Yep. I'll just zoom in on each

9fc0ba69-3845-43cf-8510-ccb94dfb68ae-1
00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:17.980
one. OK, so now.}

e510e91f-4ff3-4d7a-a2ea-d25194c7686a-0
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.329
I don't know if he went. I don't
know if he went to that

e510e91f-4ff3-4d7a-a2ea-d25194c7686a-1
00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:27.475
building. He's walking somewhere
and this little fish friend just

e510e91f-4ff3-4d7a-a2ea-d25194c7686a-2
00:31:27.475 --> 00:31:31.180
walked. {What's now? What's
this? The microphone is muted.

e510e91f-4ff3-4d7a-a2ea-d25194c7686a-3
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.060
What can you?}

a8a611b1-0a02-4151-9b32-511335fa311b-0
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.518
{If you swipe back and forth,
you can see the screen or the

a8a611b1-0a02-4151-9b32-511335fa311b-1
00:31:39.518 --> 00:31:40.690
participants.}

7e31e348-7f20-42e6-ae5f-f3fbbdb476f5-0
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.340
{You might.}

23c78372-0f74-43bb-8507-58f6fc65a6cb-0
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.640
{You're muted now.}

32570b09-8902-4693-bcbd-d9e2249a4873-0
00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:04.268
{Bear. How's that? Good. OK, }
so he's just walking along with

32570b09-8902-4693-bcbd-d9e2249a4873-1
00:32:04.268 --> 00:32:08.690
his fish and there's other
people walking along with.

f4339c2d-30b6-450e-abb3-26a911e9a2b2-0
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.510
Creatures of their own and this.

fe28c33f-5ede-42f6-858e-b76ac3bc2f1d-0
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.347
And it's very drab. Very, very
drab. Now there's one man that

fe28c33f-5ede-42f6-858e-b76ac3bc2f1d-1
00:32:18.347 --> 00:32:22.902
has a stick and he, {well, I
sure can't see it. As well as

fe28c33f-5ede-42f6-858e-b76ac3bc2f1d-2
00:32:22.902 --> 00:32:27.612
what's with my iPad?} I don't
know. There's one man that has

fe28c33f-5ede-42f6-858e-b76ac3bc2f1d-3
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:32.168
sticks and a lot of little
objects. I don't know what he's

fe28c33f-5ede-42f6-858e-b76ac3bc2f1d-4
00:32:32.168 --> 00:32:34.330
doing with them anyway. Our.

7985cf25-0bb0-43e8-9de2-2592f64b60dd-0
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.419
Friends seems to be looking at
two men talking, negotiating.

7985cf25-0bb0-43e8-9de2-2592f64b60dd-1
00:32:40.419 --> 00:32:44.598
There's maybe he's wanting to
buy some of these vegetables

7985cf25-0bb0-43e8-9de2-2592f64b60dd-2
00:32:44.598 --> 00:32:48.210
that the man is selling, and
then there's a woman.

ae39942d-341f-42b3-8753-7d5e855179a7-0
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.358
Getting something from a machine
and it almost looks like a like

ae39942d-341f-42b3-8753-7d5e855179a7-1
00:32:54.358 --> 00:32:54.750
a bank.

ed50ebb9-eed9-4e59-80bb-0b8f132973f6-0
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.490
Umm.

3898517f-60e8-4a28-8f28-8b9276bac7c0-0
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.777
Like a bank machine where you'd
get money from the bank and then

3898517f-60e8-4a28-8f28-8b9276bac7c0-1
00:33:00.777 --> 00:33:01.570
there's a woman.

f0702603-aee8-42b1-a3d7-ed9e6012b9db-0
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.059
Has a little fish in a box and a
man with a hat is looking at

f0702603-aee8-42b1-a3d7-ed9e6012b9db-1
00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:11.414
that, and I guess we're just
looking at all these people up

f0702603-aee8-42b1-a3d7-ed9e6012b9db-2
00:33:11.414 --> 00:33:11.850
close.

e9b80f45-e81c-4579-b2ba-2f0bf46dea8c-0
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.020
Um, there's an.

33d2faf6-c148-4e95-a575-a1c10ec4efad-0
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.669
I think our friend Ohh he has
this little book out again and

33d2faf6-c148-4e95-a575-a1c10ec4efad-1
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:20.530
he's showing.

ed00967c-dc08-4efc-90b7-ceb245a46240-0
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.371
He's looking for the picture
bread, so maybe he can show it

ed00967c-dc08-4efc-90b7-ceb245a46240-1
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:24.940
to someone.

c29ea254-0af9-427c-a7d9-960d85265f96-0
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.245
Perhaps and find some bread. I
don't know, he wants bread.

c29ea254-0af9-427c-a7d9-960d85265f96-1
00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:34.832
Maybe he showed it to his fish
friend. But anyway, his little

c29ea254-0af9-427c-a7d9-960d85265f96-2
00:33:34.832 --> 00:33:38.310
fish friend found found
something on the wall.

4b6af196-b82c-414b-923f-18d307b3e077-0
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.900
And when the man opened, it
opened the drawer.

0c7251b1-3bed-4ed0-84db-6f0d27aac0ca-0
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.540
And there was a little.

c6a369a0-8141-4076-87c4-301ebb04a4d4-0
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.760
Looks like a little.

23d3e48d-3970-4e5b-989a-989b0f13013f-0
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:56.208
acorn in there. So he looks up
in the book. What is that little

23d3e48d-3970-4e5b-989a-989b0f13013f-1
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:59.560
thing? Let's see if I can find
out what that is.

38ad4683-412f-4237-b841-a1db13ecfe88-0
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.790
{Again.}

39a92802-2f2c-40fb-b726-f352614b2d18-0
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.330
{Microphone is muted. Can you
hear me? Yes, I think.}

4fba9639-b332-414e-9338-040152a257d6-0
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:13.481
{When I swipe, I go to the next
yeah, I'll have to be more

4fba9639-b332-414e-9338-040152a257d6-1
00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:15.430
careful. So he picked one up.}

ce1ac76e-c277-4923-88c9-3b75f5d889d2-0
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.431
Picked one up, there's several
in the drawer. Picked one up and

ce1ac76e-c277-4923-88c9-3b75f5d889d2-1
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:19.930
they took it.

55b73c33-7c9a-4f68-b610-c2c39311ab56-0
00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.690
To.

e54238eb-abee-435e-964c-9adc7c7a8f1c-0
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:24.380
Maybe the?

df732368-aa2b-4c36-b860-9951a91b6c0c-0
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.210
A little boy.

ceb70a23-e0ea-4ccf-a1e1-0dcd82801199-0
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.130
And.

8a24b9f7-2e29-469e-a53e-b4b2316c953d-0
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.280
Gave it to him and the boy looks
happy. And the boy has his

8a24b9f7-2e29-469e-a53e-b4b2316c953d-1
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.981
father, I think, behind him and
he looks happy and he's wearing

8a24b9f7-2e29-469e-a53e-b4b2316c953d-2
00:34:40.981 --> 00:34:44.740
glasses, he's got suspenders and
they look really happy and they

8a24b9f7-2e29-469e-a53e-b4b2316c953d-3
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.030
wave.

ba817c12-8339-4255-b1d7-6ddcaa33fb58-0
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.659
And the man says that's that's
really not puts his hand up.

ba817c12-8339-4255-b1d7-6ddcaa33fb58-1
00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:53.158
That's not really what I wanted,
I wanted. He points to the

ba817c12-8339-4255-b1d7-6ddcaa33fb58-2
00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:54.150
picture of Bread.

dc626987-8431-44fc-90b3-bd7c9c8f3223-0
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.646
And you know, I want to be able
to. I want to cut it. I want to

dc626987-8431-44fc-90b3-bd7c9c8f3223-1
00:34:59.646 --> 00:35:03.931
put his hand down. Like I want
to cut it and I want. And the

dc626987-8431-44fc-90b3-bd7c9c8f3223-2
00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:06.180
man, the other man with glasses.

c211066f-50f7-4277-90fa-89ef3246ae32-0
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.230
Points to something on the wall
and opens that.

d33080af-e0bd-4f1d-9ae2-72e45602be76-0
00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:19.166
Compartment and reaches in and
gets out something else. It

d33080af-e0bd-4f1d-9ae2-72e45602be76-1
00:35:19.166 --> 00:35:20.290
looks like 

c1150b0c-74f1-4457-abc3-216785fcb617-0
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.422
I don't know what a little. I
don't know. It looks like a

c1150b0c-74f1-4457-abc3-216785fcb617-1
00:35:26.422 --> 00:35:31.378
little bit like a snail shell.
So the boy, his son, comes over

c1150b0c-74f1-4457-abc3-216785fcb617-2
00:35:31.378 --> 00:35:36.256
with a big bowl, his big smile
and and they're really excited

c1150b0c-74f1-4457-abc3-216785fcb617-3
00:35:36.256 --> 00:35:39.560
and happy and they give the man
the bowl.

8687872b-9c50-469e-9891-99dd5b3a5920-0
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:47.116
{And see if the iPads, gosh, no,
I'm worried about that. OK, so I

8687872b-9c50-469e-9891-99dd5b3a5920-1
00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:51.450
think I'm done with my, done
with that page.}

2d424d34-eb62-4a86-bb28-6df6ed82de2b-0
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.110
{Wow.}

4f0e9759-97d7-4a69-b7b4-bcee2918297d-0
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.821
{Microphones unmuted. All right,
I'm trying to make sure I'm at

4f0e9759-97d7-4a69-b7b4-bcee2918297d-1
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:22.164
the beginning. All right,} so
this first picture, the man with

4f0e9759-97d7-4a69-b7b4-bcee2918297d-2
00:36:22.164 --> 00:36:25.680
the suspenders and the glasses
is holding up this.

9c2838d0-11bc-4df8-8084-4124eee63edd-0
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.160
Fish.

9ad7f61f-fd85-4ed7-87f7-196aa82b90c6-0
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.480
And.

908b7173-3228-41ea-9f12-fdb4c42599f9-0
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:35.442
And the boy is holding the other
thing that looked like a now it

908b7173-3228-41ea-9f12-fdb4c42599f9-1
00:36:35.442 --> 00:36:36.620
looks like a horn.

0cba1566-af56-424b-938e-b9b77d475735-0
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.360
And there's this little white
lights coming out of it again.

8d483bf5-0a77-4ed5-82fe-449b89d7eea2-0
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.280
And.

68b2f35f-abf4-4a62-8d47-ff16b345cffc-0
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.000
Father's thinking.

fed2bb3a-7e9d-4bf2-a778-cdf96ebf7964-0
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.613
And the boy has nice get
something else now looks like a

fed2bb3a-7e9d-4bf2-a778-cdf96ebf7964-1
00:36:51.613 --> 00:36:54.885
big strawberry. And they're
really excited like maybe

fed2bb3a-7e9d-4bf2-a778-cdf96ebf7964-2
00:36:54.885 --> 00:36:58.884
they're going to make something,
put all these things in that big

fed2bb3a-7e9d-4bf2-a778-cdf96ebf7964-3
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:01.490
bowl and now they've got like a
clamshell.

4ed6f0bc-922f-4079-b568-abfac6ee2c1b-0
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.900
And he's trying to open it and
it looks like a snake.

2e0d1c9a-af51-42d2-8b3f-514ea37b6b0c-0
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.717
Maybe they're going to put all
these things in that bowl and

2e0d1c9a-af51-42d2-8b3f-514ea37b6b0c-1
00:37:10.717 --> 00:37:11.700
make dinner and now.

bcaf2a5c-3d17-43d4-ac99-37ded75dbdfe-0
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.144
He says. But wait a minute.
First I want to get one of these

bcaf2a5c-3d17-43d4-ac99-37ded75dbdfe-1
00:37:16.144 --> 00:37:19.809
and it looks like a fish, but
when he cuts it, it looks more

bcaf2a5c-3d17-43d4-ac99-37ded75dbdfe-2
00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:20.230
like a.

adb0a2bb-6563-4e25-9810-15cd5a8a832b-0
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.120
Star fruit.

5b3b2ac0-ea84-403b-bdc9-a3d702484a10-0
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.580
And he says.

3dfe0f4f-b774-4ba8-93c0-2282610d9697-0
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.969
You want to try some? And the
boy is about ready to take a

3dfe0f4f-b774-4ba8-93c0-2282610d9697-1
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:30.740
bite out of.

a072adfd-5535-4e1f-9b3d-06df12473ffe-0
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.568
{Something this is so hard to
name things, I don't know how to

a072adfd-5535-4e1f-9b3d-06df12473ffe-1
00:37:35.568 --> 00:37:36.720
name these things.}

eaaed554-06e9-411e-b832-43b818dca37e-0
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.358
And the man looks like the man
might have taken a bite out of

eaaed554-06e9-411e-b832-43b818dca37e-1
00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:44.467
that star fruit, and he's not
sure he likes it, though he has

eaaed554-06e9-411e-b832-43b818dca37e-2
00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:45.319
a bit of a frown.

378ff91d-aef5-4dbf-b261-098af2e6221f-0
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.236
Has the boy gives a piece to
that that little fish that's

378ff91d-aef5-4dbf-b261-098af2e6221f-1
00:37:50.236 --> 00:37:52.370
been following the man around
you?

9e67b43b-6f47-4ca7-b53c-dc9851d33554-0
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.420
And there's the bowl

93e6fe3c-46cf-46dc-940a-055be3cad050-0
00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.250
With all those things in it and
more.

eec3f97a-b784-451f-a67f-4d80b79093d5-0
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.830
Little.

49c3e984-a4cf-4af0-9934-c55b31658955-0
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.780
Beautiful little arrangement of
food that they've prepared.

b12733de-1789-4be6-9959-e419f0e5ddb3-0
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.480
And they

b2b32e03-91e3-417c-9055-b35362813b98-0
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.530
They take that bowl

2acf1f18-c2a3-4092-90a9-4fe9d474fb7f-0
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.780
The man's got the bowl

0e4d242d-8392-48d4-821f-6bc1c3d286ee-0
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.422
They don't look like they all
have bowls. All three of them

0e4d242d-8392-48d4-821f-6bc1c3d286ee-1
00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:20.120
have bowls.

3e2f4e7e-04ac-4ff8-a0ca-7919426b8ce9-0
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.990
And they're taking the bowls.

b3e6e06a-8556-4b7e-9ea6-24626754d036-0
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.540
Somewhere there's a bunch of
boats here. I don't know if

b3e6e06a-8556-4b7e-9ea6-24626754d036-1
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.977
they're going to get in one of
these boats, but they're walking

b3e6e06a-8556-4b7e-9ea6-24626754d036-2
00:38:30.977 --> 00:38:31.890
toward the boats.

09a804c6-5243-4659-9924-1228694258f3-0
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:33.970
Great.

a91e55c9-18cc-441c-be33-b8a4c11024b3-0
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.250
{Man, there's more. Alright, man
gets his.}

88e1406d-b23d-40e0-9165-a1a35c49edad-0
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.050
{Right.}

1bca81f2-8f00-4515-808c-3840bb7695b3-0
00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.020
Huh. So they stopped for a
moment and.

20e22f11-5606-421e-9e2c-6bedf6f00542-0
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.187
They're looking at the things in
the bowl again. The man reaches

20e22f11-5606-421e-9e2c-6bedf6f00542-1
00:38:53.187 --> 00:38:55.740
for something small. Looks like
an egg.

d915d394-9736-4fc3-a838-1916b6a02307-0
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.080
And the man says I.

d4ca5c16-d5a4-4029-abe1-21864d1745c5-0
00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.000
I don't know if you really
understand what I want.

493b4a43-37f6-4c21-8825-504df3c2ba74-0
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.010
Umm.

21c67971-8297-45f5-82e4-49e62d1385f7-0
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:11.450
{Ohh I'm oh oh oh oh I missed
some. I'm sorry. I started on

21c67971-8297-45f5-82e4-49e62d1385f7-1
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:16.042
that. Can I start that part
over? I missed I I was on the

21c67971-8297-45f5-82e4-49e62d1385f7-2
00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:17.230
same page. OK.}

f83db881-372a-486a-9c80-6be6db6abe60-0
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.452
{OK, now I see it.} The boy
looking at the boat. He's got

f83db881-372a-486a-9c80-6be6db6abe60-1
00:39:23.452 --> 00:39:27.780
his bowl. The little fish is
following him. There's a bowl.

08a8ecee-d0ed-484d-8988-6ece5c5b5ada-0
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.940
There's a vase on the boat. OK,
so the boys.

ce0e6f77-8367-4505-9754-5b362218b5c0-0
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.746
It's exciting. And he says come
here, he's calling his probably

ce0e6f77-8367-4505-9754-5b362218b5c0-1
00:39:39.746 --> 00:39:44.082
his father, and the father comes
over and he sees something

ce0e6f77-8367-4505-9754-5b362218b5c0-2
00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:45.890
growing out of that vase.

c9d03c89-9d43-48e6-8bc9-d117d59bcc24-0
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.900
Um and ohh it's.

3731500c-6d45-4598-9297-6493e802813d-0
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:57.330
Sort of a tail of a dragon. It's
all spiky and it scares the man.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.920
The man with the.

86673f6e-e169-4d9a-b40d-6ad870b17d1e-0
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.650
I mean that.

10c2ca08-0c49-48e0-802b-a7694689649c-0
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.839
Not the father of the boy, the
other man. And he and he drops

10c2ca08-0c49-48e0-802b-a7694689649c-1
00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:08.840
his bowl and.

9501b2fa-4e6f-4f00-b106-6e6320e7f1f2-0
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.030
Um.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.657
That man, the father of the boy.
Says It's OK. It's OK. Don't

77644efe-8c02-4e33-866a-a5c02c50a60f-1
00:40:16.657 --> 00:40:17.060
worry.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.660
And.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:25.505
He says look, look. So they both
look a little closer. Ohh. And

a6b56576-b60f-4ab4-bf22-e7b2176d792f-1
00:40:25.505 --> 00:40:30.133
it wasn't a serpent, it was a
cat with a spiky tail. And the

a6b56576-b60f-4ab4-bf22-e7b2176d792f-2
00:40:30.133 --> 00:40:33.320
boy looks really happy, like
maybe found.

06ea1917-b203-40d4-85cd-929acfa472b9-0
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.140
A pet he had lost and.

f0f9aa3f-5cc0-4992-90fe-c390f1fe40f2-0
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.790
He's smiling and the boy says,
oh, so this is, you're happy

f0f9aa3f-5cc0-4992-90fe-c390f1fe40f2-1
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:47.200
about this, this is your pet.
And, and the father looks really

f0f9aa3f-5cc0-4992-90fe-c390f1fe40f2-2
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.400
thrilled. He says, yeah, yeah,
and look, our cat is playing

f0f9aa3f-5cc0-4992-90fe-c390f1fe40f2-3
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.450
with your fish.

55ee3151-3d29-42ff-a755-c288d5bdfcc1-0
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.430
So.

c7f04b39-3ff4-4afc-bb36-613838ac2da3-0
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.650
So the cat.

c5ca39ed-adb2-4d03-9005-496599865e43-0
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.940
And the fish are looking at each
other and now they're picking up

c5ca39ed-adb2-4d03-9005-496599865e43-1
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.154
all those things that fell out
of that bowl that the man

c5ca39ed-adb2-4d03-9005-496599865e43-2
00:41:12.154 --> 00:41:16.886
dropped when he was startled me
and said I'm so sorry I dropped

c5ca39ed-adb2-4d03-9005-496599865e43-3
00:41:16.886 --> 00:41:21.545
all those things. And the other
man said that's OK, but what I

c5ca39ed-adb2-4d03-9005-496599865e43-4
00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:25.389
really want. And he draws again
what I really want.

fe676130-1744-4f5e-b46a-d4fb5640d655-0
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.030
He draws that tail.

6dbbf074-764d-4625-acc9-5123d6c4ceb7-0
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:35.547
Over the houses he draws that
tail of the spiky tail of the

6dbbf074-764d-4625-acc9-5123d6c4ceb7-1
00:41:35.547 --> 00:41:35.870
cat.

585d9de0-3487-4c2d-9644-e335fbea5458-0
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:43.083
I don't know if that's what he
wants, but he draws the spiky

585d9de0-3487-4c2d-9644-e335fbea5458-1
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:45.901
tail of the cat over the houses,
shows it to the man with the

585d9de0-3487-4c2d-9644-e335fbea5458-2
00:41:45.901 --> 00:41:47.220
suspenders, and the man says.

ff0ad905-d5f2-447c-ba58-5b7e23f28a54-0
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.410
I'm not sure.

17a40db7-c9f1-42c9-b16a-d687ad53db90-0
00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.060
I understand but.

7a90daae-7a75-484b-9b6e-13a82213a7bf-0
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.896
#END_arrival-4 And he looks up
up in the sky and now we're

7a90daae-7a75-484b-9b6e-13a82213a7bf-1
00:41:58.896 --> 00:42:02.573
looking at him really closely
with his close up of his face

7a90daae-7a75-484b-9b6e-13a82213a7bf-2
00:42:02.573 --> 00:42:04.290
and now close up of his eye.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.990
{And that's it.}

hard to see.}

ladders, people coming out. {I

00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:46.670
don't know what else to say.}
All right, that's life jacket.

75db4ffa-5c74-4bc5-a3b0-c576aeb10d4e-0
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.050
{We can move on to the next
one.}

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:52.610
{OK.}

1273ab66-567b-440d-9ac9-c2a1fb29c7af-0
00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:01.131
{OK, so this one is that's
different. Yeah, it's a

1273ab66-567b-440d-9ac9-c2a1fb29c7af-1
00:47:01.131 --> 00:47:02.860
fantastic fantasy.}

c9f66809-1e43-4dcc-8022-2f49d88cc21b-0
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:09.507
{More poetic? I think. So, yeah,
just do the best you can. It's a

c9f66809-1e43-4dcc-8022-2f49d88cc21b-1
00:47:09.507 --> 00:47:13.886
bit longer, so don't you don't
have to dwell on each each page

c9f66809-1e43-4dcc-8022-2f49d88cc21b-2
00:47:13.886 --> 00:47:16.250
and figure out what's
happening.}

67712e1f-bc05-4c54-952e-12ecf4126a9f-0
00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:21.487
{It's always helpful to name
what you see, but again, because

67712e1f-bc05-4c54-952e-12ecf4126a9f-1
00:47:21.487 --> 00:47:25.341
it's a bit long, you can you
don't have to take as much time

67712e1f-bc05-4c54-952e-12ecf4126a9f-2
00:47:25.341 --> 00:47:27.490
and name every little thing,
OK?}

a8b7792f-18d3-44d2-bfcb-777256ae8f6d-0
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.073
#START_wanderer Well, OK,
there's a man in a striped

a8b7792f-18d3-44d2-bfcb-777256ae8f6d-1
00:47:31.073 --> 00:47:31.390
shirt.

473e2e58-9749-4fbe-88ff-47d4767841dc-0
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.330
With another sort of superhero.

e5d40722-b407-4445-a15d-ea745074643a-0
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.520
And they are folding a very
large piece of paper into.

887df45e-0008-4893-b34a-0163c3bc7d14-0
00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.820
What looks like a paper hat.

43746040-72b6-4026-a07f-3f74218a2bae-0
00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.180
But then in the next frame, we
see. We see.

a62a00b3-023f-4a33-8f58-0000b0fd3aa5-0
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.547
Ship and we see the top of it,
and we also see the bottom of

a62a00b3-023f-4a33-8f58-0000b0fd3aa5-1
00:47:57.547 --> 00:47:57.760
it.

d517c89e-688f-4549-9d4e-ea491011aed9-0
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.768
It's like we can see right
through a cross section of the

d517c89e-688f-4549-9d4e-ea491011aed9-1
00:48:02.768 --> 00:48:04.100
water, a really big ship.

319b6240-62ad-45a5-83cb-8045277336d7-0
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.050
So it wasn't a paper hat, it was
a.

921974b5-3895-41fd-9bed-342c74a56261-0
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:14.321
Paper boat and it's on the water
right next to this big ship

921974b5-3895-41fd-9bed-342c74a56261-1
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:14.770
with.

e8b13211-0cda-4a02-b6a1-913dd9702eac-0
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:17.500
nets and masts and

a974b1b2-b390-4645-a727-5f428385c728-0
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.410
Smokestacks and.

00347c90-861e-481c-b958-455d10813fe1-0
00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.720
Flags.

987d671d-47f7-4e55-a689-75458a9c1536-0
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.210
below is a 

bbbb68d3-26e2-4579-850e-c54cf2addd3c-0
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.480
Below is a propeller and.

e3bee403-32e7-43a2-a641-6742706e291c-0
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.240
Cage that someone might be in to
be safe.

5ce7f31d-9438-4d4e-8f98-e471850d9135-0
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.980
Works OK.

62a34cd8-ce29-4f87-8b03-71b20cec6e82-0
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.830
Alright, so now.

0da6ae53-c05b-4536-a6f3-a1ee45473389-0
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.861
We're above the water and we
just see, don't we see that

0da6ae53-c05b-4536-a6f3-a1ee45473389-1
00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:50.850
little paper boat?

1e09aa1c-046d-40d8-a19f-0bb69ac4aa2a-0
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:52.860
And.

3bf63696-18da-4d13-bb56-45e9ec12f6cb-0
00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.250
We don't see the big boat
anymore, we see.

849c5bc1-d591-4266-a528-58b6d8cc17de-0
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.780
It's about 10 birds flying above
the water.

3b2e4746-1454-4388-bf5b-f8688a912150-0
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.750
You can see waves, right?

c7b10ca8-f40c-4c22-9354-6c1426a5e612-0
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.410
Umm.

9a83a376-2fe3-4181-9c75-d39c3b37df69-0
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.520
Now we see turtles.

9b32b263-0d3a-4d80-aaed-89269b316a4d-0
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:16.672
With Checkerboards on their back
and the birds are right down

9b32b263-0d3a-4d80-aaed-89269b316a4d-1
00:49:16.672 --> 00:49:20.322
there with the turtles and
they're trying to get into the

9b32b263-0d3a-4d80-aaed-89269b316a4d-2
00:49:20.322 --> 00:49:20.700
paper.

de7fafd6-7566-4439-882f-e3a986ef4f29-0
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.450
boat and.

a006c32c-fee0-4230-8c66-b1f3c65f919c-0
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:30.206
Now a huge whale is trying to
get in or trying to maybe eat

a006c32c-fee0-4230-8c66-b1f3c65f919c-1
00:49:30.206 --> 00:49:31.660
the paper boat.

e66781dc-9b4a-4e2b-abd9-4497685e62ce-0
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:41.531
And maybe he's eating it. I
don't know, see it anymore.

e66781dc-9b4a-4e2b-abd9-4497685e62ce-1
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:46.153
Maybe it's there somewhere. But
now we're under the oh, there it

e66781dc-9b4a-4e2b-abd9-4497685e62ce-2
00:49:46.153 --> 00:49:47.860
is. So he didn't eat it.

51556921-f7e1-45eb-a6bb-ca6f9a5e3b53-0
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:53.056
And he picked it up with one of
his fins. And it's above water,

51556921-f7e1-45eb-a6bb-ca6f9a5e3b53-1
00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:56.730
but everything else we're
looking at is below water.

1eaf6d84-b235-454a-8e93-a446a2c565a4-0
00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.680
The whale and.

5a6de44a-6738-4f57-8a4a-2b4d646bd53e-0
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.260
Is that fish? Swordfish.

1865a28b-6382-475d-837d-233d2b9e5e6b-0
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:11.021
And a school of fish, 2 2 
schools of fish and a zebra fish

1865a28b-6382-475d-837d-233d2b9e5e6b-1
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:12.220
and lots of.

cadf23d8-3ca6-47d2-bd87-4a7f16272232-0
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.830
Sea undersea.

fa66277c-4823-47d9-b307-d7567c72d97f-0
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.530
Vegetation and coral.

109e0933-08fb-4d3b-83fc-9b8f3bfb6534-0
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:26.310
{Item second. OK, so now all.}

e77bdd99-068e-4637-a611-07773bd23edf-0
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.040
OK, now little paper boat has
gotten.

107f99b5-84c4-46f0-a204-159c6a9bf945-0
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.060
Hung up on a little bit of that
vegetation that.

4f1197a6-7ee6-45ad-abf7-893d7049833b-0
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:40.020
Was above the water. The rest of
it is below water, and he's just

4f1197a6-7ee6-45ad-abf7-893d7049833b-1
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.490
kind of sitting there on that
little hill and above.

c2ba104b-116c-492a-835a-d59a5ccd38dd-0
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.070
Above the water, meanwhile, all
we see, all that.

9f5bad5a-cffd-428c-9c98-e80d3de817c8-0
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.080
Well, that's all those fish and.

03d0643f-0024-48c7-a8a2-2c4d45c5625e-0
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.930
Coral and vegetation below.

16d99b5e-50f1-44a4-be21-413bccfb68e1-0
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.550
Hmm.

d2d9d76d-ca59-450b-af2f-5e2ea6bd2858-0
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.060
Well, some little creature.

29351d27-2e9d-417a-a8ba-7f3d0b84d15f-0
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:11.659
Climbs up. Ohh the boat has made
its way off of the little hill

29351d27-2e9d-417a-a8ba-7f3d0b84d15f-1
00:51:11.659 --> 00:51:16.060
and now it's floating in the
water again and the little

29351d27-2e9d-417a-a8ba-7f3d0b84d15f-2
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:20.461
creatures climbed up and kind of
attached itself to it.

29351d27-2e9d-417a-a8ba-7f3d0b84d15f-3
00:51:20.461 --> 00:51:24.470
Meanwhile, down below 2
Angelfish are kissing and.

21def8f0-2a2a-43b5-832a-fd33a069e4c6-0
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.730
There's.

54eb98b6-506c-40ba-be62-c2007e0bee46-0
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.400
All kinds of beautiful fish and
sea life.

8f80eaab-e9e6-45cf-ade8-30a0e6c09dc1-0
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.910
{Yep, that's good.}

8b59a35c-61a2-4d2e-b891-ff78a8014d45-0
00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.276
{Now wait a minute, go back.}
There was a there was there a

8b59a35c-61a2-4d2e-b891-ff78a8014d45-1
00:51:40.276 --> 00:51:42.110
fishing pole coming out of that.

7be0488f-66b2-4175-a25f-4dddcac8956a-0
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.930
Looks like there's a fishing
pole coming out of the paper

7be0488f-66b2-4175-a25f-4dddcac8956a-1
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:47.160
boat.

bd30fb6f-a9b0-44fb-a410-95fc9ee8103e-0
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.781
So that little animal climbed in
there and and and somehow put a

bd30fb6f-a9b0-44fb-a410-95fc9ee8103e-1
00:51:52.781 --> 00:51:54.590
fishing pole there and he.

d2964133-e7d4-4fff-b0b0-2eb9bb43c076-0
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:58.220
He's gone down to try to catch
another fish.

2a403b27-89f9-4bd7-ab73-9d726061ac20-0
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:02.476
Ohh, and there's another fish
that has scissors. Oh, that's

2a403b27-89f9-4bd7-ab73-9d726061ac20-1
00:52:02.476 --> 00:52:05.884
interesting. And he might cut
cut that fish free. I'm not

2a403b27-89f9-4bd7-ab73-9d726061ac20-2
00:52:05.884 --> 00:52:07.060
sure. We'll see. OK.

5826806f-79c6-4377-af4d-5a3f2fbedb31-0
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:10.830
So.

a97e4cf0-a215-4042-a379-ac42bd5521c2-0
00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:14.160
Wow.

d145b73c-874a-41f0-9e86-d5d01da6753f-0
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.080
Well, just everybody's curious
about the paper boat. There's.

66fd3725-e72f-441a-a4a9-bc4a5994bcf4-0
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:27.188
Seahorse that gets up on top of
another fish to get a good look

66fd3725-e72f-441a-a4a9-bc4a5994bcf4-1
00:52:27.188 --> 00:52:32.396
of that at that paper boat, and
it looks like he has the little

66fd3725-e72f-441a-a4a9-bc4a5994bcf4-2
00:52:32.396 --> 00:52:33.209
paper hat.

99327ff0-49a4-43f5-bf32-6c36bc39b85d-0
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:38.620
And he's standing on some coral
so he can get a good look.

9cec8aab-1c4f-43d5-8fc4-985f302dbd3a-0
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.630
And Umm.

a87c0a61-f70b-4b79-84fd-19b4ee4a32cc-0
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.780
In the next picture, there's a
an eel.

dca66eec-6023-44c8-96db-9bc39f4b27f2-0
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.280
That somehow gets itself above
water and it's looks like he's

dca66eec-6023-44c8-96db-9bc39f4b27f2-1
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.900
trying to get into the paper
boat.

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.550
Hmm.

5305d728-ed6e-4adc-9789-f59c47ebb9ef-0
00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.385
{What are those? I don't know
what those are.} Those Stingray.

5305d728-ed6e-4adc-9789-f59c47ebb9ef-1
00:53:02.385 --> 00:53:02.970
Yes. OK.

d65d36fb-720f-4433-8c63-4c79dffb7c51-0
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.250
Oh, now we are.

60cedb5b-4e98-4b07-a153-5dc700278d8e-0
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.320
We we're above water. We're
above we're.

e75d1a6e-7601-41b8-a085-26e736805c64-0
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:20.043
You know, for, Oh yeah, the boat
still in the water, but it's

e75d1a6e-7601-41b8-a085-26e736805c64-1
00:53:20.043 --> 00:53:22.320
approaching a big, a big cluster
of.

6f22a61c-a240-4f6d-a0db-08cec38e2587-0
00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.790
Bushes and in the bushes there's
some beautiful white.

84e31e49-5443-4af3-861b-0277ebc4c434-0
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:29.390
Birds may be there.

84721a0d-5f65-4331-a18d-eadd2e3ea234-0
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:31.580
Egrets.

2c1b37b7-d23d-40e4-a501-a5ab2ae17b1e-0
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.440
And um.

388956ab-31fb-40c8-bef3-d8bd44f1fb1a-0
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:37.700
And.

6fdcae24-dc84-4b87-ade7-27ffee45afc9-0
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:42.450
{I'm not sure that's that's. I
don't know what else to say.}

5910bb95-5be3-451c-9aa4-701dec433b4a-0
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:43.760
{OK.}

e5d46876-8528-4d4b-a1bf-15e7451f06ae-0
00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:04.322
Well, a paper boat floated by
the bushes with the egrets. And

e5d46876-8528-4d4b-a1bf-15e7451f06ae-1
00:54:04.322 --> 00:54:05.410
there's.

fa0027f9-d986-456e-a374-559593e0469c-0
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.230
Lower bunch of starfish and.

4cab2188-0659-4077-ac5d-9934af777a21-0
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.917
Beautiful fish. There's a big
fish in the background that

4cab2188-0659-4077-ac5d-9934af777a21-1
00:54:16.917 --> 00:54:18.020
might be coming.

17202d88-fbdf-46cb-817a-9dbe8bd87ac3-0
00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.710
{I don't know, but there's not
much to say about this.}

b6612815-a041-4d40-80cb-28aa3a45b722-0
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.220
It looks like the.

f3d22c11-f029-4751-a31d-e89a0351d2f1-0
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.050
Paper boat is still in the
water.

ff664c37-cfa2-4080-bb9d-cf97d770c084-0
00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:41.687
And the seahorse with its little
paper hat is still in there,

ff664c37-cfa2-4080-bb9d-cf97d770c084-1
00:54:41.687 --> 00:54:42.970
loading along.

a2f49286-ad8c-45c1-8359-bd6d0b60381f-0
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.950
Through.

9210d1fa-2d00-41f4-8282-91a68d54b897-0
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.170
through tunnel vegetation?

7c87782c-6efb-4502-9039-6ecb729f3e5c-0
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:54.160
And there's some it's it's late
now I think, because they're.

d312d7c6-691d-4901-b4f8-e330e8145708-0
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:02.873
So it's dark in there. Maybe
it's just dark in the tunnel.

d312d7c6-691d-4901-b4f8-e330e8145708-1
00:55:02.873 --> 00:55:07.610
There's some birds with eyes
that are bright lights and.

febe580a-4fa6-424e-b4e3-6f8a23a4c996-0
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:17.370
And they're looking at the paper
boat of interest.

6927b63d-14a9-4ad8-b05c-5845204ce0c4-0
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.030
{I don't know what else to say
like that one, OK?}

a999ce6d-c9ce-4478-84ad-e0631601a54f-0
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.208
Oh, OK, well, paper boats coming
out of that tunnel, maybe

a999ce6d-c9ce-4478-84ad-e0631601a54f-1
00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:40.300
emerging from the tunnel, it's a
little brighter.

df6f4b23-0735-4232-8ce9-c6aa8d5af4eb-0
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.360
And.

9f74f123-5674-4432-b0a8-a565cd2fbdf6-0
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.750
Down below is a.

39084858-2606-44dd-9489-884cab878223-0
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.310
Maybe a lobster?

590ece25-f1ff-4f46-b053-73133960a438-0
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.183
And there's someone, not
someone, there's something.

590ece25-f1ff-4f46-b053-73133960a438-1
00:55:54.183 --> 00:55:57.989
Another sea creature riding the
lobster. Ohh, the seahorse looks

590ece25-f1ff-4f46-b053-73133960a438-2
00:55:57.989 --> 00:56:00.389
like a a seahorse is riding the
lobster.

efb2150a-df18-47c6-a31c-3307f9030893-0
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.500
And.

a6b930b3-0e2e-4a84-9f14-030b34305326-0
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:10.865
There's a lot of seahorses that
look like the seahorse that's in

a6b930b3-0e2e-4a84-9f14-030b34305326-1
00:56:10.865 --> 00:56:13.020
our paper boat off to the right.

da40dbd8-ad94-4c05-8952-082a611fa219-0
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.910
Maybe. Oh, and he lost his hat.

b7ffcffd-7e45-46c6-bf8b-ffb613d72e3a-0
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.444
Looking at him like, how did you
get in there? What did you well,

b7ffcffd-7e45-46c6-bf8b-ffb613d72e3a-1
00:56:23.444 --> 00:56:27.033
what is that thing? I don't
know. So he comes out, but he

b7ffcffd-7e45-46c6-bf8b-ffb613d72e3a-2
00:56:27.033 --> 00:56:27.900
loses his hat.

a7552643-49e9-40ee-a42a-ffb6b6ea64f5-0
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.100
Umm.

0bc0ff93-01b7-4df0-8550-ab7a1ad3acc8-0
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.260
{No, this is kind of weird.}

1f36045d-bd4f-46ab-a531-3371986b06f3-0
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:37.840
Hmm.

81c3701c-08ef-4730-8020-c9a1752380e4-0
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.130
OK, well.

5ecb3534-1f1b-47ed-8a55-01a09eed8f5b-0
00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.370
Along comes a whale.

3b4dafd9-5d97-429b-ad29-dcd19042f47a-0
00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.990
Smoking a pipe.

9f50f33e-0d51-40d3-bfbe-8e711263515a-0
00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.650
And he just kind of.

7dbac773-7843-45ed-b135-8321d44738bb-0
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:05.410
Sits there with some birds on
his head.

8f153ada-b775-4ab2-8f84-b3aafe34bc36-0
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:10.790
While the paper boat just kind
of floats by. But then.

56f7dd03-4057-4fba-851d-3b8da6443593-0
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:13.180
a different.

ffc2562d-76c8-481d-a4be-fe8927d33ce3-0
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.836
Creature that looks something
like the whale, but he's

ffc2562d-76c8-481d-a4be-fe8927d33ce3-1
00:57:17.836 --> 00:57:20.570
different because he's got claws
and.

6ee1892b-6ded-4701-833e-b60bd7bc4eaa-0
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:27.245
Fluffy, fluffy fins. He spots
that paper boat and he might

6ee1892b-6ded-4701-833e-b60bd7bc4eaa-1
00:57:27.245 --> 00:57:32.946
just if he opens his mouth just
right, it might just go right in

6ee1892b-6ded-4701-833e-b60bd7bc4eaa-2
00:57:32.946 --> 00:57:38.648
there. But he does have sort of
a fishing pole coming out of the

6ee1892b-6ded-4701-833e-b60bd7bc4eaa-3
00:57:38.648 --> 00:57:40.490
top of his head with.

ebe750be-c722-4cb3-9f2d-b1e686e3a8ec-0
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.050
Some kind of box hanging from
it.

86b5d709-082f-455d-b72d-6ea2caf0a537-0
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:51.505
He is on the top of a bunch of.
He's standing on what looks like

86b5d709-082f-455d-b72d-6ea2caf0a537-1
00:57:51.505 --> 00:57:51.710
a.

7b89ec69-8ee2-489f-94f5-5902baee3bc5-0
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.050
The wreck of several ships all.

bb153d5c-0d1d-4438-b802-8f2ac9d31872-0
00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:57.930
Together.

b6ebcd11-6377-41a2-bbfb-f1bca1ffc22d-0
00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:02.290
{OK, good to see what happens
next.}

5e53a7df-75a5-4188-8b6c-391356f9b6e5-0
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.510
So.

0508ea25-aa12-40b3-b0e0-9fb2cfb2bb8e-0
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:09.970
Umm.

bd72aec1-e74f-4e53-be25-579623ffbe4b-0
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.250
{OK. I'll see the paper about it
there.}

8d40a6c2-1855-4c55-81fd-b2a1687df13f-0
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.290
{Oh, right there.}

6d9b2340-9f94-44fd-ad4c-1dfb72d0d58b-0
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.790
{OK, so.}

d0542078-0453-42e9-a905-6481cf3f46c5-0
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.510
I don't know what happened.

131dd952-6849-46cf-9998-25ec3ce24624-0
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:30.610
But somehow the paper boat did
not get eaten by the big whale.

91f11a61-1209-4a90-9adb-566f2399c45a-0
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.970
With fluffy fins.

fb2d7695-0e71-4ea2-8432-b181f365f55f-0
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.520
But now he's surrounded by.

a4a11cb6-4cc6-418d-8c26-77f3ee4005cc-0
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:39.610
A lot of other.

b8fab0dc-e397-45e1-b386-af7f67b9fdfb-0
00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.650
Creatures an elephant

73b5009c-2bbe-4018-9854-912413991085-0
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:46.000
Several elephants and.

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:51.140
Serpents and half butterfly,
half birds and.

1de6297c-6848-4dc5-8a3e-fbf34c336a8c-0
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:56.980
A horse and a Jaguar and a.

f1b5f2a6-00d0-4ba0-865f-a23f39528144-0
00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:03.519
Dog and his zebra and a cat and
the cat's afraid of the zebra

f1b5f2a6-00d0-4ba0-865f-a23f39528144-1
00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:06.730
and it's jumping into the paper
boat.

8b49156a-38d6-465d-9d14-7608e31fa524-0
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:09.780
{And we'll see what happens
next.}

cb096109-602c-4630-bbee-2e0847a4c9e6-0
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:16.400
I don't know how he got away
from all those.

368a071f-b51a-4175-a647-10d8c2e2de36-0
00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:19.360
characters there's all those.

124eeeb2-5c2a-4847-b74f-6dd75cc86a2b-0
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.240
Fish with bright

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:27.197
Bright eyes, he said, just
sailing along, nobody bothering

7f296a27-e0a4-4533-9b71-1eb6ecbb1f65-1
00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:32.373
him. Nobody even insight, except
all those. There's a big school

7f296a27-e0a4-4533-9b71-1eb6ecbb1f65-2
00:59:32.373 --> 00:59:33.010
of fish.

e203e49a-d4fb-465a-a624-22d733e931fa-0
00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:34.300
With.

76990f76-43e7-4226-9d37-081ceba6001d-0

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.530
Lights for eyes and up above we
see.

c00dba1c-2b68-4b39-aa99-a09c234d5dd6-0
00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:47.966
Bunch of stars and the moon, the
Crescent moon, and probably

c00dba1c-2b68-4b39-aa99-a09c234d5dd6-1
00:59:47.966 --> 00:59:48.510
some.

Planets and.

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.980
 Milky Way.

e00394f1-bd94-445c-a378-25d70fb0c655-0
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.638
Those two main building it OK, I
don't know what else to say. So

e00394f1-bd94-445c-a378-25d70fb0c655-1
01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:10.016
now there's all those fish with
bright right eyes. They have

e00394f1-bd94-445c-a378-25d70fb0c655-2
01:00:10.016 --> 01:00:12.120
surround that school have
surrounded.

256c7202-08a6-4567-9865-a9b4e2f4a431-0
01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:17.910
Surrounded the paper boat and it
just can't move and they're just

256c7202-08a6-4567-9865-a9b4e2f4a431-1
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.810
looking at it. They don't.

bae10694-413a-40c7-97d7-2315a5b45c9b-0
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.510
They're not bothering it,
they're just looking at it.

65587244-75c0-4033-81fd-e262e156ff21-0
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.520
And now they.

be8f6cb0-261d-46a2-801b-2bcdce4f3751-0
01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.241
have stopped looking at it. I
don't even know where they went.

be8f6cb0-261d-46a2-801b-2bcdce4f3751-1
01:00:37.241 --> 01:00:37.860
Maybe they.

a942f85b-6439-43d8-b778-83b2d73a208c-0
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:43.110
Went down below water. Or maybe.

598cc853-8a7c-4496-914c-7688e56b8e2a-0
01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:47.261
Yeah, they must have gone down
below water because those are

598cc853-8a7c-4496-914c-7688e56b8e2a-1
01:00:47.261 --> 01:00:48.140
stars in the sky.

d106462b-0b9e-4ff4-98f7-58d0a1cf79fa-0
01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:52.538
And the boat is just floating
along again. But there's

d106462b-0b9e-4ff4-98f7-58d0a1cf79fa-1
01:00:52.538 --> 01:00:56.030
something looks like a curtain
coming down from the sky.

a8f22849-cc50-4dde-a9b8-d7a1f24f0939-0
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.870
Yeah.

54bbede1-ba5d-4a40-aa10-e458b394fc7d-0
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.710
{I don't know what else.]

7cf1153d-e5c4-4ca1-8900-06833f56d151-0
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.060
Ohh.

6194cf76-4cfd-45be-a98f-2f5c9c9be0e8-0
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.060
About to.

59e3c22c-f3fe-450b-ba35-d7667a0e4286-0
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.200
Run into maybe an iceberg.

3c11622a-f493-44e0-b42f-1cdaef7691d8-0
01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.150
Umm.

b173ab1c-232b-4c79-a8ab-325a0371b7fd-0
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.400
Yeah, yeah. Huge iceberg.

7cf741ae-8d0d-4bc7-a75b-72c88ae1db2f-0
01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.799
But there's a little hole in the
iceberg and he floats right

7cf741ae-8d0d-4bc7-a75b-72c88ae1db2f-1
01:01:31.799 --> 01:01:35.590
through the hole and there's
lots of broken pieces of ice.

02b3c4c8-5e69-4237-8634-c953c7444adf-0
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:41.563
But he somehow can float through
the pieces, keeps going through

02b3c4c8-5e69-4237-8634-c953c7444adf-1
01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:45.380
tunnel. Looks like it's a tunnel
in the iceberg.

bc312ff4-578a-4c20-bd27-f9cdc75162c1-0
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:47.240
boating

a8317f73-32e0-45f4-a506-f0a9e8387ad0-0
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:49.700
{What did I do?}

2117ff78-c5a7-4b1f-93a0-0ebd1cc63c25-0
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.660
{Are you there? Up there? OK.}

11eb549c-862b-4c77-92ec-701b7942332d-0
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.960
OK, so he goes through the
tunnel and I don't know where

11eb549c-862b-4c77-92ec-701b7942332d-1
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.060
he's going, but we'll find out.
We'll find out.

b417ec9d-ecee-4d43-bf5c-5fe19ccd1b61-0
01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:12.140
OK.

cd3f579d-50eb-4537-8eec-443bf59d7085-0
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.420
Comes out the other side of the
tunnel.

0732ebcd-f32a-4be3-9c7b-fa7d234627c8-0
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:25.730
Hmm.

ce474252-a5db-4996-bea7-01bc88435fd0-0
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:37.669
He looks like he's in something
like he got in some kind of a

ce474252-a5db-4996-bea7-01bc88435fd0-1
01:02:37.669 --> 01:02:38.040
bag.

2bf57a8a-609d-446f-bf71-ea1d87bf4250-0
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:40.980
No.

78b180c7-b6de-4e27-a951-5f3a4430b67f-0
01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:44.630
looks like he is

a1141090-c452-45b1-87be-4f6c525c2890-0
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:49.134
The the boat looks like the boat
is stuck in something in some

a1141090-c452-45b1-87be-4f6c525c2890-1
01:02:49.134 --> 01:02:49.700
kind of a.

0e5e5c33-1479-4c5a-a4d0-b577a1823afc-0
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:52.480
Funnel with that.

cb4aed9b-5ebd-46f0-8bda-cb2d2291e4ac-0
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.100
With a handle.

104d1a95-11ed-4ba1-be73-cf31351bbc35-0
01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.480
And there's a.

81d32b6e-f6b6-4bcf-83bb-9d20f687c439-0
01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.700
Deep sea diver.

fb7cf663-c549-4d76-864f-79bac581af07-0
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:02.750
That might have set a trap.

ccf1f38f-7594-4596-b076-1136e3282438-0
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:10.686
And he's got all kinds of things
in the trap. He got a fish and

ccf1f38f-7594-4596-b076-1136e3282438-1
01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:11.620
he got a.

7a454a3b-2457-41e7-93f2-c88b8db0c2ed-0
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.200
And you got the paper boat.

c0c2e103-ef9b-470e-a954-eedd66646490-0
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:21.480
Reaching for it. He wants to
look at it.

3441dfd0-2620-4497-a46b-d34bb6ed7353-0
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:26.409
He's got a helmet and he's got
oxygen going through a tube.

3441dfd0-2620-4497-a46b-d34bb6ed7353-1
01:03:26.409 --> 01:03:28.220
He's got a tank on his back.

37ba69ad-2f5e-4747-83c1-4bfe3887d299-0
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.170
And you can see I'm looking at
it.

92db92f3-a6de-4a77-8566-e9ecf591d684-0
01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:34.630
I don't know.

33912377-4761-4572-a0c8-0bb65ef3bfea-0
01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:52.380
Well, he must have released it,
must have let it go.

76482443-50a0-4b9b-a07c-e80d652202b3-0
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:57.050
Because there it is on the
surface of the water again.

2f32852f-23fb-4f89-a1df-910bbcc918b3-0
01:03:59.050 --> 01:03:59.910
Umm.

6c6ed25d-1ebd-4d01-8835-4426a6f6dadd-0
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:07.630
Getting close to a big, big ship
tall vessel

75cda10a-4c04-4ed2-ae3a-ebab2d76daf3-0
01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.510
There's always lots of
smokestacks.

3755516a-7a0d-4800-bd97-80af088f2cb4-0
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:14.560
And.

54834a02-c172-4ba2-8b99-d6a2126dadb0-0
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.160
He's getting really close.

b85761b8-1a32-4ae0-a42f-77e4a0c2c422-0
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.820
Um.

3e3e70ed-6f1a-4506-99cf-846450cf9ea3-0
01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:28.500
I see an anchor on the ship, I
see.

330125fc-4532-40df-bcec-8fd882d866c1-0
01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.770
Something that looks like the
ship might have just.

8aefa4c1-866a-468b-8716-c5c7991f8ee7-0
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.723
Maybe that's just a wave of
water. Looks like we just hit

8aefa4c1-866a-468b-8716-c5c7991f8ee7-1
01:04:37.723 --> 01:04:38.510
something, but.

9e60e404-986b-4a28-bd2a-c3c2a97ef489-0
01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.826
I don't know, big ship. It's
getting really close to this big

9e60e404-986b-4a28-bd2a-c3c2a97ef489-1
01:04:42.826 --> 01:04:43.090
ship.

f1b5ed9c-726f-40bc-a7b1-81c563e14f80-0
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.610
{I don't know what else to say.}

8680f67c-0221-4a37-9e02-144db84aee29-0
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:50.540
Now it's.

1b32b403-4713-40e7-a8d8-602db538f4f5-0
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:52.550
Dark again.

1c6ffc1b-d7a9-4a0e-8e0b-ff1107da8bae-0
01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:58.626
And lots of little birds are
coming to check out the little

1c6ffc1b-d7a9-4a0e-8e0b-ff1107da8bae-1
01:04:58.626 --> 01:05:02.800
bow, and it's still floating on
the surface of the water.

b41b9b8e-bfb4-471d-ad6e-3850e3a4bcc2-0
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.920
Somehow it was not smashed by
that big ship

15b89aaa-e532-4bdd-966f-38999204b502-0
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.380
Yeah, which is now going on its
way.

c3ce4ba7-84de-4ce5-8c1d-8e00fa1cfeb7-0
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.390
Are those doves they look like
doves

af46db55-b098-4e33-b987-ca6f3c0ff714-0
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.700
And there's a.

b3054c65-1219-4b1d-9594-a96755b4d146-0
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.630
There's a big white.

c5d14021-98c2-439b-ae20-af37534f2588-0
01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:25.000
Leaf.

fe1be508-36d3-4a13-8a0d-acc39f9ea3e2-0
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.330
floating

326b5f9d-40f1-4d0b-a029-883b9355b96a-0
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:30.620
It's like a big.

34b0e0e7-1d35-4642-91e2-9a7a6cff405a-0
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.970
fern leaf or something, I don't
know.

f9690dec-c1e5-4f33-ac64-51395efa4dfc-0
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.001
{This is really bizarre.}
Anyway, the ship is gone and

f9690dec-c1e5-4f33-ac64-51395efa4dfc-1
01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.800
it's caught a huge fish.

ae2a0fb6-6226-4ec4-a543-1e1ca34ae92c-0
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:43.790
It's hanging from.

2da6e982-23b1-42fb-93e8-b3b9eafc5e15-0
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.324
A crane or something. Maybe
that's not the ship. Maybe

2da6e982-23b1-42fb-93e8-b3b9eafc5e15-1
01:05:48.324 --> 01:05:51.180
that's a building in the
distance. I don't know.

5b287312-e6cd-4719-97ce-de2e2abbb052-0
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.250
Yeah, it is. But the little
paper boats still floating.

348ea0c6-41e6-478a-a521-05087edf7e6c-0
01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:02.530
Yeah.

543a4890-5f25-4a7d-bcf3-5f9ca12872d4-0
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.920
{What?}

4aae9035-f77d-4a14-aafc-e81887bf6cdd-0
01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.710
{Can't even see this very well.}

37e681c1-3dad-44be-a746-dc915b01565f-0
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.202
There are. This must be in that
boat or building. I still

37e681c1-3dad-44be-a746-dc915b01565f-1
01:06:33.202 --> 01:06:35.170
haven't figured out what it is.

25f3e133-6b8c-4e37-b96c-65ff0e2600c2-0
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:41.660
Several men shooting into the
water.

65a655ee-c0ac-42a1-aa7a-b4ba50c06b51-0
01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:49.717
One of them might be shooting
the paper boat, one is shooting

65a655ee-c0ac-42a1-aa7a-b4ba50c06b51-1
01:06:49.717 --> 01:06:50.400
a wheel.

260e105a-8309-4b21-89ad-688deea7c2e1-0
01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:52.640
One is shooting.

a714b6db-d2dd-4c61-9f34-e258a30ad92e-0
01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:58.410
Another man that looks like just
like the ones shooting.

92eea3a9-782b-474c-adad-4810bf922e49-0
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.390
And there's a big.

4a8563df-91e5-4999-90b1-5f878fbfb87f-0
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:08.010
Chain coming down with a, don't
know what to call that.

c1020836-d5a1-4895-aed6-a4be35cf6513-0
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.170
A grabber.

a2de9f8c-5769-4ba8-ad1c-5f4bbd8e8dab-0
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:15.930
Might be going to go down and
pick up that man.

e8c29d95-cd26-4a4c-b5cf-5011bdc45e74-0
01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:20.070
It's not the same man. Now we're
I'm on the next page.

f85867dd-c5d0-4d43-b078-b0a80ea3d60f-0
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.640
Ohh.

8f46e2ff-560c-4a2c-951f-19b99cda1e96-0
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.850
There's that's. I don't know who
that is. It's another diver.

07ad8afc-130e-461f-89ea-cc0540db51c7-0
01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.790
Is making his way through some
junk.

c1de450e-926f-499b-86f6-c28bd58e45cb-0
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.710
Making his way over to the paper
boat.

b3fc2194-e8a3-4465-a4bc-8eb670b5b794-0
01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:38.870
Maybe.

69d9d634-ea33-4c18-98b6-914ab4583ab0-0
01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.553
I don't know where he came from.
That does not look like anybody

69d9d634-ea33-4c18-98b6-914ab4583ab0-1
01:07:43.553 --> 01:07:44.460
we've seen so far.

f4f13adb-aba0-47f6-988f-51dca6428282-0
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.690
He's working on like a a rocket.

e812b137-d19e-4d56-88f4-656e86e86544-0
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.840
And he's always going over to
pick up the paper boat, which

e812b137-d19e-4d56-88f4-656e86e86544-1
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.180
has a.

bb57868e-5dc0-47d3-9c5a-bf6f6033527f-0
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.570
Looks like a life small life
preserver on it, yeah?

29b6709a-b627-4ff8-a681-3dc99e83bcc8-0
01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:02.450
{I don't know what else to say.}

1e429bbb-12ac-4859-8439-c8ce7035467f-0
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:05.560
It's.

fd770473-b0f9-4a60-b463-e78a8560838a-0
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.080
Well.

44d5178f-2788-45d4-91a6-88cdefcdba57-0
01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:13.869
I don't know. He must have
missed it. Oh, no, there he is.

44d5178f-2788-45d4-91a6-88cdefcdba57-1
01:08:13.869 --> 01:08:16.470
He's still trying to get it.
He's got a tool

bb5c95a2-b567-424b-b9d8-27976e822427-0
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.090
And he's he's either pushing it
or pulling it.

bc8b702b-6c6c-4764-aeab-83d8fccedfb5-0
01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:21.620
Umm.

5d8c6491-c19d-4c84-ae7c-357b1e01d78f-0
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:25.380
And in the distance.

0e47161a-9250-43a2-b38a-b746ef735170-0
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.180
Here come a bunch of.

906c5cdb-ab30-4b1e-ad71-a05d74e08009-0
01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:33.230
Creatures or horses, spotted
horse and.

abd68a03-edb4-47e0-93dd-ddc8a3ff3307-0
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:36.270
Like deer with stars and.

50445a3e-ff89-488e-8356-f53404b44c5a-0
01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:38.550
Checkered.

a115855f-fe4a-4141-8356-3fdbacea093a-0
01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.490
Anteater and.

10b82b07-92dc-4718-a214-5eb1a6744409-0
01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.750
A cat that looks somewhat
normal.

6a8157ea-0230-439b-92a4-e7c3ad00faa2-0
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:48.930
And it.

d45e24a6-d053-45ca-a5ab-881f26fa4cc9-0
01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:57.196
They're all they're on. They're
on a little, they're on a tiny

d45e24a6-d053-45ca-a5ab-881f26fa4cc9-1
01:08:57.196 --> 01:08:58.000
little boat.

b7112bdb-460f-4e99-ba3b-eba5a658c35d-0
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.050
And they're they too are curious
about the paper boat.

be83efbb-72fa-459b-89fe-28a1130782a0-0
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:03.790
Hmm.

6204d7df-f135-4dfc-911c-8fb736a4f790-0
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.360
They're being.

0e181621-6ece-45e1-b6c8-eae8037c3799-0
01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.950
Yeah, they're.

674c9b52-8697-4214-8d22-0f7b5656a9b4-0
01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:13.011
So they they got these creatures
and we've got the deep sea diver

674c9b52-8697-4214-8d22-0f7b5656a9b4-1
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:15.840
and they both seem to want the
paper both.

0b2fead3-ea50-4b46-980c-2dc2694cc144-0
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:18.310
{Gonna find out.}

9656093e-3dc5-4f94-a5f1-d6b5bbd42f4d-0
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:29.040
Ohh, here comes a huge wave.

5fc88dd6-a793-4258-9a50-8eb157b4a5a6-0
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.630
Right.

f6269963-d089-4f02-89b2-efb2979fcf32-0
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:37.405
When they were both going to get
the paper boat came in this huge

f6269963-d089-4f02-89b2-efb2979fcf32-1
01:09:37.405 --> 01:09:41.160
wave and the paper boat gets
swept into the wave.

9ba87593-af40-4d8b-840b-879391492a39-0
01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:43.540
And.

8c060ef3-5240-41ad-8955-f40078567e13-0
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.080
the deep sea diver.

3cb3dc6c-486e-4b1f-beab-cb9153bd0300-0
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.825
Not sure where he got to, but
the creatures also got swept

3cb3dc6c-486e-4b1f-beab-cb9153bd0300-1
01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:56.790
into the wave.

82caeac0-740d-430f-9949-63fc6357c027-0
01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.250
They were. It looks like they
were pulled by a kite. I

82caeac0-740d-430f-9949-63fc6357c027-1
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:02.650
wondered if that was a kite.

f89b7a49-cd86-4a9f-8de8-703ebf91a6ab-0
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:09.110
And the kite is now all
tattered. Kite had stars on it.

d76a2984-a5b3-4bca-903a-1ef40d3a42b8-0
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.880
Two children hanging on to the
kite.

cbff60e7-5f81-4064-868f-6ce76e5b6963-0
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.310
{I don't know. This is bizarre.}

50118721-c40b-4d5c-932f-49a75437a2e6-0
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.170
Yes.

68b26b05-1356-4ca4-b65e-750a669899a3-0
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:26.830
OK, the big wave is gone.

c468d61b-6455-4e32-bbcc-5d087cbbd86b-0
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.524
The water has calmed down, but
there's a storm because we see

c468d61b-6455-4e32-bbcc-5d087cbbd86b-1
01:10:33.524 --> 01:10:37.500
lightning just hit the water and
we see storm clouds.

677f1e3d-c07d-47cf-91a8-1ebb9ad8b3c1-0
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.790
Oh, and the lightning hit the
water.

9faadcde-d8f8-4811-b988-8f83ce9f5fbf-0
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:48.320
Turn that paper boat into a
paper rocket and it's it's.

e97ab6c9-8952-44bb-a22a-30fe062b9af4-0
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:50.960
Took off through the sky.

155df5e4-7c80-44d9-a695-36d0c7fd26aa-0
01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.780
I'm assuming that's that's the
same paper.

eef5f433-00fb-4af0-a8f2-858e4f8e3483-0
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.320
Or is it?

b1f29a84-fdfc-4cab-93f5-3c51f7f18f33-0
01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.960
{I can't tell. Well, no, maybe
not.}

385d33a5-85f8-4ff4-8e38-884497495810-0
01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.750
{There's so much for my story.}

1e44861b-02ac-4926-b549-6c033e4624f2-0
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:13.055
{That was exactly right.} The
paper boat is still there, so

1e44861b-02ac-4926-b549-6c033e4624f2-1
01:11:13.055 --> 01:11:17.004
that must have been somehow
another rocket that created. But

1e44861b-02ac-4926-b549-6c033e4624f2-2
01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:21.148
this little paper boat is still
in the water. You still see the

1e44861b-02ac-4926-b549-6c033e4624f2-3
01:11:21.148 --> 01:11:22.120
waves and it's.

f940d7bc-332f-428d-a4cd-ace2f29762d2-0
01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.790
floating toward.

14b472f8-f664-4cd4-96e9-7ff3fa00625b-0
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:26.100
What look like

3bcdfc0e-30cd-4bdf-99a6-c3efe9e25864-0
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.020
Donuts.

e43e6ebe-e39e-45c5-9c0e-5713682907b0-0
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:33.360
{Yeah, yeah. I can be hungry.} I
see donut.

032e6ebc-1e16-4b91-8ae0-58f40cd36265-0
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:39.480
And there's a there's a serpent.

308ae566-4bcf-49d9-9179-38bc11bdb6dc-0
01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:44.390
Oh, it's not Donuts. It's a
bunch of serpents like that.

6bae7278-42c7-474b-84d1-be0fe6df6c40-0
01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:51.638
It's flying into a just a huge
nest of serpents and one of the

6bae7278-42c7-474b-84d1-be0fe6df6c40-1
01:11:51.638 --> 01:11:52.490
serpents.

3589989e-e961-4d76-8302-f616377a7be6-0
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.530
Lifts his head and grabs onto
the paper boat.

f234e619-34f7-4215-991b-a97ed3cf463d-0
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:08.660
And takes it inside.

2d7aa07e-b386-4eee-aad5-2a1f8ccb9b07-0
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:13.830
And drops it on.

467981ef-ecb7-4bfc-9fa9-ef24808fae8b-0
01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.040
A little bridge.

98ef7371-d612-44a5-9ffa-d3d523560f40-0
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.730
You know, couple of ugly
creatures with bright eyes.

d1a5b3b9-cda2-4d93-a5da-872e4901bee4-0
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:28.889
Staring at it, trying to figure
out what it is, it looks like

d1a5b3b9-cda2-4d93-a5da-872e4901bee4-1
01:12:28.889 --> 01:12:32.160
we're in the heart of the nest
of the serpents now.

c839b1fc-098e-4347-9ebf-0941f821eff6-0
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.270
I don't know if we are
underwater or not.

dc79114e-329a-4661-a2cc-e36eae39b62d-0
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:44.206
Somehow you escaped them too,
huh? Oh, wait a minute. What is

dc79114e-329a-4661-a2cc-e36eae39b62d-1
01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:44.540
this?

5eafd3cc-ad1e-4f97-8761-d1dee3664e7c-0
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:49.010
{We got the last two pages. OK
so.}

f34b7cd6-7988-4a18-bd74-19d0f10bd4b0-0
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.090
One of those characters
creatures.

8f2eaeda-9173-4f4e-89b9-f1990e8a55d8-0
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:59.630
Fills the boat with water from
its.

0c8c64c8-1aaf-4d57-94e0-2865093d0330-0
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.050
Nostrils.

43d2f132-d7b5-48a9-b06b-33704f6536ed-0
01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:04.890
And.

f941a90a-3206-41d9-9fb5-db26f0ddd1bf-0
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:10.760
The water just it doesn't sink
the boat. It just flows out and

f941a90a-3206-41d9-9fb5-db26f0ddd1bf-1
01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.880
the boat continues on its way.

301b08fd-61e5-4b82-909a-97603acfef50-0
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:19.250
Um, a little rumpled, but still
floating.

5833b5c0-5256-4636-b111-5a28a481d507-0
01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.450
He's coming close to an island
now.

1f8e4e3b-fa68-4216-b236-486e0a6e684a-0
01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:28.906
An island inhabited by a polka
dotted fish with striped

1f8e4e3b-fa68-4216-b236-486e0a6e684a-1
01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:30.130
underwear and.

1498fff2-f14a-4256-9d34-94210f304583-0
01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:31.970
Uh.

58e8d6bf-eab5-43a3-b4e1-e1cb479e24be-0
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:43.930
Very long, scraggly fins, and on
the island are the pieces of

58e8d6bf-eab5-43a3-b4e1-e1cb479e24be-1
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:47.270
boats and bottles and cans and.

2490757b-5150-402f-b79c-6701843ce440-0
01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.770
Wheels.

162a63fa-3830-4275-a32b-b7ba81b22986-0
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:53.030
Yeah, yeah.

4af16b42-0020-4bd8-8475-8fab0260c359-0
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.920
But the boat still floating.

c9c03cbf-7bdb-43a1-8e28-c95d18839584-0
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:00.990
Hmm.

9f0ecafa-dd7e-4524-bf2f-4f8151332193-0
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.460
Now we see.

8081cd07-0f57-4804-abbe-4c0a8765f69a-0
01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:12.500
What are those? Those jellyfish?
Hmm. We see.

80f181fe-bd0c-4795-bb94-88745fc370de-0
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.560
Jellyfish.

22eef515-0435-4155-8d9a-16771641ed7d-0
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.080
I don't know how we got here.

63f67f4f-18fd-4ca8-ac1f-8606516d0240-0
01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:25.240
I don't know. I don't. Oh,
there's the paper boat, OK.

8f2baf4d-5fbe-4033-9866-5cdb3a46b544-0
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.090
Um, it's just.

eea61606-4fc4-40b5-b86f-2a022b165db4-0
01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:35.337
It's just encountered a big
school of jellyfish, beautiful

eea61606-4fc4-40b5-b86f-2a022b165db4-1
01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:36.550
jellyfish and.

000a1e92-4124-48fe-8e1c-cd6a8fdfc862-0
01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:41.021
I see it in the first picture.
In the second picture I don't

000a1e92-4124-48fe-8e1c-cd6a8fdfc862-1
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:42.450
see it anymore. So either.

164983b6-6835-49aa-99b7-54935745e635-0
01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.110
It's made its way through or
they did something to it.

7e2313d3-302d-4c3e-9c43-253257af2615-0
01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.920
Look like maybe it was way
through, but now it's.

4a20bb8f-2820-4f41-a3ce-24b0ef1f8d92-0
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.700
It's in the middle of another
school of fish.

b7d192f3-ad34-4237-a7ee-8ad832f2d55c-0
01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.074
{It's not just either it's just
one big page or is this 2 pages?

b7d192f3-ad34-4237-a7ee-8ad832f2d55c-1
01:15:06.074 --> 01:15:10.198
There's two of them. 2 pages,
yeah, 2 pages. OK. I can't see

b7d192f3-ad34-4237-a7ee-8ad832f2d55c-2
01:15:10.198 --> 01:15:14.524
where the division is.} OK, so
the paper, the paper boat is now

b7d192f3-ad34-4237-a7ee-8ad832f2d55c-3
01:15:14.524 --> 01:15:16.349
in a school and other fish.

14fff7e2-6e86-4728-bbfa-d486742d543e-0
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.550
Being rescued by this other
school of fish.

fd02867c-5f73-4285-b4a7-3c80cbb9292b-0
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:24.200
And going along nicely until it
comes to.

1486dc25-a45c-404f-b7b2-f54b693fa1a7-0
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:32.640
Sort of an octopus.

56d9fb68-2c42-4d46-9db3-190125706b94-0
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.536
And there's still some jellyfish
around, but we'll see what

56d9fb68-2c42-4d46-9db3-190125706b94-1
01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:40.000
happens.

311405ae-5416-4277-a337-6d8d8e0b44a3-0
01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.030
{No idea.}

4dd1e35d-1e40-4ed2-82df-f5e7221c8fae-0
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:50.770
The octopus.

1e021460-b209-4f0d-8263-fac232202b31-0
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:57.220
Has some buddies so those three
octopus start exploring.

42aa6415-501e-46f9-a572-c6c5019a7fbc-0
01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.980
The paper boat, but the paper
boat

a51d5a78-cf11-43ae-813a-1eda98e196f6-0
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.950
Somehow gets away. Or they let
it go because now it's on the.

b1f255e2-2526-46c8-9960-a5c13cab318e-0
01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:08.870
 front.

9e28069e-96c1-4db6-82a3-0ec35824e0f3-0
01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:12.560
Of a submarine.

a8f60eee-0f5a-42c5-8704-b036e1fb14cf-0
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.500
Checkered submarine, that's.

96496305-e582-43ad-8f32-ce37f3b13b5f-0
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.550
Underwater, and that's being.

200bdad2-8432-4c29-934e-79f69a1fcf42-0
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.020
Examined by.

684ef439-f519-4fd6-92a9-3a6b99eac2e9-0
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:24.460
Some fish with.

14842e69-7f44-4f0d-86fc-03e04ef0eae1-0
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.550
Lights.

92c5db0a-99fa-431f-93e7-f42a18833d87-0
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:32.050
OK so then.

ef13d0dd-850e-4f80-a89b-2c0fae0fad0a-0
01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.520
Submarine is now half above
water and half below water.

d6aa20b0-5354-4e00-8ccd-53d9be539cb7-0
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:41.980
And.

e0b9d653-4f43-4954-b9a0-aee2fb50301f-0
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.766
The paper boat is on the front
end and the water is pouring out

e0b9d653-4f43-4954-b9a0-aee2fb50301f-1
01:16:47.766 --> 01:16:48.170
of it.

b17bf96e-b273-4cbe-b924-1b5d489fb04d-0
01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.480
School of Fish below it.

d41f5166-beb8-4656-90e3-ccc493e760d7-0
01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.870
Oh, and another fish has come
to.

bfeecd5c-4bc6-40c7-a868-269efa4c04b9-0
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:57.230


63524450-ce20-4e72-8e81-714e5307aa3d-0
01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.806
I was going to say to rescue it,
but it needs rescuing itself

63524450-ce20-4e72-8e81-714e5307aa3d-1
01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:08.090
because it's it's been attacked
by by the serpents.

832df362-3b69-48b2-8fe5-386f1d3cd26b-0
01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.390
But have.

2f0eb309-c6c4-412a-b3bb-145577ec42c6-0
01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:18.652
{Sorry. No, that's OK. I just
didn't know what else to say. }

2f0eb309-c6c4-412a-b3bb-145577ec42c6-1
01:17:18.652 --> 01:17:22.173
Alright, we got two. We got a
submarine and a ship in

2f0eb309-c6c4-412a-b3bb-145577ec42c6-2
01:17:22.173 --> 01:17:22.760
distress.

6b1032dc-1c9b-4e9b-a097-bba965e03b96-0
01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:30.201
So some sea otters come along
and wouldn't you know they they

6b1032dc-1c9b-4e9b-a097-bba965e03b96-1
01:17:30.201 --> 01:17:33.030
just think that paper boat is
very.

756c9641-c42b-488b-9d56-7ac03343009a-0
01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:38.449
Interesting. And they just start
playing with it, bouncing it off

756c9641-c42b-488b-9d56-7ac03343009a-1
01:17:38.449 --> 01:17:42.372
their nose. Sea otters or
flowers. I don't know, there's a

756c9641-c42b-488b-9d56-7ac03343009a-2
01:17:42.372 --> 01:17:44.700
bunch of them underwater
watching.

b5f65635-10eb-4e83-b9eb-87f6518d491a-0
01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:49.670
And they just are having a good
time playing with it.

16197677-e6fa-496b-8d31-8996d932af01-0
01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.020
But there are some other more.

2f0aa154-8d73-494a-ac73-6bf93d723863-0
01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:58.410
Menacing looking fish
underwater, watching them.

32d7baab-e03e-4c01-af62-5109852b0b87-0
01:17:59.290 --> 01:17:59.980
Umm.

60350dfa-a6ef-4210-8877-56855e090b22-0
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.690
Well, but they the the.

95f49999-d9b6-45c8-ae16-ac067edd9bd2-0
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.669
Sea otters are done seals.
Whatever they were there, let it

95f49999-d9b6-45c8-ae16-ac067edd9bd2-1
01:18:08.669 --> 01:18:08.880
go.

b183229a-30e6-47b3-98ea-c45e601ed670-0
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.652
boat is just still floating
along with all this sea life

b183229a-30e6-47b3-98ea-c45e601ed670-1
01:18:13.652 --> 01:18:14.840
below and vegetation.

e550b1f8-5165-4421-9a17-aa8af29eef47-0
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.910
Still floating along.

3c008dd7-1b21-43f2-a0e0-04b540b3490a-0
01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:22.440
And they're just, it's just
going over.

df1cee69-9f3f-4722-812a-ea74b94f8bde-0
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:29.320
So deep sea diver who has found
a beautiful.

cb19b614-4984-4147-89b6-850b661a0bf6-0
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.390
Little round.

1e44137e-3092-43ef-9993-f044656c2a40-0
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.700
Light underwater.

7e85ba1b-b45e-47c0-a60c-12e2c33d1308-0
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:40.334
And I hope he knows that he's
pretty close to a big serpent,

7e85ba1b-b45e-47c0-a60c-12e2c33d1308-1
01:18:40.334 --> 01:18:40.550
so.

2ad7a59e-f48e-400d-b7df-b9bf89fe4b90-0
01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:47.535
He is riding the serpent. He
somehow got control and he's

2ad7a59e-f48e-400d-b7df-b9bf89fe4b90-1
01:18:47.535 --> 01:18:52.820
riding the serpent. He's got a
basket with those lights in it.

6cc86452-bf6f-4060-85a1-f320b23bbaf5-0
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.190
And he's back to.

f1f1d05e-91ef-416f-9716-83ea032d5297-0
01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.140
A buoy.

e30b1cd9-2bca-4a0d-898b-1e01d0ea1c99-0
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:00.360
Umm.

2aee97a8-4800-4821-8d04-6bd9303fe5f8-0
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:05.913
Looks like those little
creatures are his friends.

2aee97a8-4800-4821-8d04-6bd9303fe5f8-1
01:19:05.913 --> 01:19:10.411
There's a lighthouse in the
distance, not too far away, and

2aee97a8-4800-4821-8d04-6bd9303fe5f8-2
01:19:10.411 --> 01:19:15.210
there's a person there looking
for him, maybe in a big ship by.

1f16a45f-b5cc-4f03-83c9-6d7d83676b4e-0
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.300
The paper boat is right there.

9294f777-4296-46e8-843d-21c740a11903-0
01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:20.450
Umm.

89fbd12c-a750-476a-acea-998c8720b63a-0
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:24.050
Floating free.

b15678ec-29dd-4bf8-8766-798a92690598-0
01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:28.020
{Ohh my giving me a headache.}

7be6bda9-264b-4a7a-a63f-b57dd63612b1-0
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.740
It's all.

af0fc62a-1463-4187-a858-4e019cf60916-0
01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.460
All kinds of boats now.

77c3f489-ba91-400d-949a-de2b0be17b74-0
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.690
Uh.

6a22f29c-3be4-4d17-a57b-0d3b51e31df8-0
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:45.360
Big tall ship and a steam vessel
and a sailboat and.

aeda91bc-56a2-4181-9089-2c0bb61b3ee0-0
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:54.144
And the paper boat, and they're
all floating along on one side

aeda91bc-56a2-4181-9089-2c0bb61b3ee0-1
01:19:54.144 --> 01:19:54.370
of.

f576a3fa-61b1-4c93-97a0-5727281b877a-0
01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.460
This wall or bridge?

a2b6d1d5-de2e-4312-b370-951b82eca0ea-0
01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:00.500
I don't know what's on the other
side, just.

3f5b2ccc-8455-406f-a11f-9081692194f8-0
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.270
I can't tell buildings or.

e1477c1a-cb98-45c6-8723-1895caee5675-0
01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.110
Something.

d7e19128-cd65-4bea-9db2-4679b27b2b58-0
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.500
Uh.

f0108aab-7cd6-4b2b-9d19-1b9513ee7115-0
01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:13.088
So there's all these different
kinds of ships. That paper thing

f0108aab-7cd6-4b2b-9d19-1b9513ee7115-1
01:20:13.088 --> 01:20:17.291
is still there. So there are
ships on the other side too, at

f0108aab-7cd6-4b2b-9d19-1b9513ee7115-2
01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:17.980
least one.

cd45dc18-1482-4acd-9c70-ee9967f59521-0
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:20.280
OK.

43b0eac6-c4d1-4c57-a4e9-8658104a98d1-0
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:25.680
Now.

e8a2b4c8-92f2-4cdf-8fd2-50811ce27e40-0
01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:32.060
{Well, what?}

b28a1179-e6f8-48f5-b729-1c3f1d0b9681-0
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:40.388
All right, there's just, there's
a city in the distance. But the

b28a1179-e6f8-48f5-b729-1c3f1d0b9681-1
01:20:40.388 --> 01:20:41.560
paper boat is.

0e7bfe08-68b7-4881-b67d-5eb582febdc7-0
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.810
I can't tell what it's on. It's
on.

fdb32ccf-dfcd-4f6b-afd1-6eb955815563-0
01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.460
a wave.

0d874190-e34d-4ca1-b992-161844099350-0
01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.180
In front of.

01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:56.440
A little ship which is in front
of a really big ship.

dfc5b762-2f22-424f-9a71-fc5a321685fc-0
01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.010
Hmm.

a0f1c1d4-88d1-4b96-806a-54af39a81148-0
01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:01.360
So the sailboat has already
collided with.

6f3321b6-caf7-4376-a373-30a58697e02e-0
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:06.796
One ship and this ship is about
to collide with the really big

6f3321b6-caf7-4376-a373-30a58697e02e-1
01:21:06.796 --> 01:21:07.150
ship.

4173fc8d-e49c-4b7e-9c6e-3064ada6f64f-0
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.310
Yeah.

60b6f048-bb94-4801-a123-c7de3d3994d5-0
01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:16.520
{I don't know. I don't know what
else to say about that.}

55c04b72-acda-4ad5-a1fe-e142464b2b20-0
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.370
{Right.}

396bc0b0-12d2-4832-9797-ed68f07b115a-0
01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.780
OK now.

c18639b8-a8e5-4cba-a8df-d463e1b35f9f-0
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.460
Where's that paper boat?

1be021c2-dc88-4c67-ad87-579453984bc7-0
01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:34.730
OK. There are a lot of things in
this harbor, little rowboat.

f8d863a3-d5e1-4f74-8707-17719012a361-0
01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:36.370
The buoy

943a2b94-1b04-4c4b-966a-74f54fbbd163-0
01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:37.580
OK.

39d764af-3052-4bd7-b52e-bf17c8aa9e14-0
01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.310
Big sort of a whale.

7b06ff2d-a222-4d5b-b604-b8c4ae5ce3ec-0
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:42.730
Huh.

edcc181a-ceb1-4c98-a9f9-04da0b8cf9bb-0
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.360
Umm.

9c5838e6-9d7c-4855-a1f1-06a58bb594ac-0
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.770
Tall ship.

750fab13-3180-42a0-88ad-ae1300a96420-0
01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.700
And then there's a a like a.

9bfae2cd-7294-4056-b618-f7702b7a8d51-0
01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:54.820
Steamship.

6f4ab4bb-12d7-4e6a-bb39-e58db7fa0e17-0
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.440
And there's a.

63d6ff44-a1df-4ea8-9e97-fd89bf1def12-0
01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:02.040
Like boat carrying people.

4fb93a43-8198-4e71-9b26-017f3138f1aa-0
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:07.850
And they're soldiers, I think.
Sailors.

32622417-a214-4cb8-afa6-9d9c8704e83f-0
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:12.980
Meanwhile, the little paper boat
is still there too. It has not.

7ccb8732-09bd-4642-b38b-8f40164beabc-0
01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.790
Gotten ruined yet?

9e855b60-5e01-4121-a32a-f7e76a9af2fa-0
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:19.724
I don't, I don't know where,
where, why there's so many

9e855b60-5e01-4121-a32a-f7e76a9af2fa-1
01:22:19.724 --> 01:22:22.050
ships, but there are a lot of in
this water.

83535e4f-3b60-487e-881e-5936e5c81991-0
01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:27.170
{OK, I'm sorry, I'm not even
naming very much.}

f7dfbded-f8e7-4245-9929-96bf7cbd993f-0
01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:32.260
{Oh, no worries. What?}

48726fd8-ee31-4f7c-af50-6ac95cdf48c2-0
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.070
{You're doing fine.}

accabc31-fdf1-48af-b51e-006cb8b1aec6-0
01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:44.928
All right. So we're coming close
to shore because there are a lot

accabc31-fdf1-48af-b51e-006cb8b1aec6-1
01:22:44.928 --> 01:22:49.630
of buildings now and cranes and
construction going on and.

39332e70-6ea6-4c33-be34-c9026137f3e9-0
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:54.160
There's a small boat with an
umbrella and a man with a hat.

5defaae3-5aa9-422e-96b4-ff7d89456176-0
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:56.390
And a little.

cb9cd876-8691-437e-829f-03a28e993876-0
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.090
Flag up on a flagpole.

03d459a0-8cf9-49ad-98d9-a606d458e47b-0
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:02.960
And.

d2f9e71d-59bb-4a62-98e9-08008a40685d-0
01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:06.930
It's a harbor.

4f261969-136e-43c6-9b63-7a8abb104384-0
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:11.420
Looks like it. Ohh, looks like
maybe it's, um, they catch

4f261969-136e-43c6-9b63-7a8abb104384-1
01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.830
lobster here or something.
They're bringing in a whole.

7a65b7a8-6894-4567-8623-5e5051f44c32-0
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.090
But.

87c310b7-8134-46f5-990b-d54dbc12bf16-0
01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:20.960
One of the.

b7771b77-68cf-419e-a028-ebfbe6230095-0
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.420
Cranes has just caught captured.

321f8aac-5aa6-43d1-be83-cafa221e3744-0
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.510
There's checkered 

d159209f-d0eb-4776-ac22-d0cee4e7dcc9-0
01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.890
Fish or.

1378e692-a03c-46ee-adb5-c29514611f86-0
01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.040
It's not a fish. It looks like a
fish, but it's a.

3d603daf-cbec-4cdd-b917-a996ee33a41e-0
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:38.671
Some kind of a vessel, because
there's a person up in the top

3d603daf-cbec-4cdd-b917-a996ee33a41e-1
01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:40.460
person with a striped shirt.

5f7f5c47-80ec-4813-8230-bcd0974eda75-0
01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.630
And.

08ab979e-9da0-4447-b703-c6fe91dab0eb-0
01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.976
They've caught, captured it, and
they're pulling it up with the

08ab979e-9da0-4447-b703-c6fe91dab0eb-1
01:23:47.976 --> 01:23:48.570
crane and.

6858b50a-45f1-4220-9e97-919655b57d16-0
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:52.400
I don't see the paper boat in
that picture.

d3c78419-df63-4d10-8d6f-bc88fd7dfb16-0
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:54.220
But.

0fbe3a5c-da5c-4740-abe7-71347d716db8-0
01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.540
So there's some stairs and a
door and a lamp.

1d81de0c-21ed-4f46-9696-002030543042-0
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.370
Probably tower.

3aa16002-59c3-4c6e-9428-55610854e0bd-0
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:04.630
OK, two men.

bff110d2-40ad-443f-ae8a-560f76f70ff1-0
01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:08.781
At the bottom of the crane with
the clipboard talking about what

bff110d2-40ad-443f-ae8a-560f76f70ff1-1
01:24:08.781 --> 01:24:09.720
they're going to do.

12589c09-4542-4524-8817-4a77d75498f7-0
01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.190
What's gonna happen?

a8ab679a-b748-4d6e-b4b0-ae1ace0e0eb8-0
01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:23.580
OK.

10d03801-337b-4b5c-a3f1-41a7590ec5d7-0
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.500
Well, on that little boat.

ae75ac51-1b22-4451-b5ef-ca1c4f2942be-0
01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:43.160
The one with the flag.

b0b8c127-c276-4425-b978-85fd82ee9cb8-0
01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:45.640
{What?}

9c7cba0e-a429-4d87-a8a1-18c6c0b843c9-0
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:49.650
{I don't know.}

54b0d45e-0bbf-4b0e-a621-f2a20045c6d9-0
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:53.640
They've caught something in a
big net

e05b44af-4a8e-4e21-a221-d46e5a0f1265-0
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.840
With their crane on the hook.

0a282f7e-d791-4784-8aaf-3bb1d73f143f-0
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.311
But they don't care that the man
with the striped shirt doesn't

0a282f7e-d791-4784-8aaf-3bb1d73f143f-1
01:25:04.311 --> 01:25:06.110
seem to care about what they
caught.

6cc0d7a8-1f9d-413e-aab7-a7a7f1a1f05e-0
01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:11.328
He seems more concerned about
the paper boat, which seems to

6cc0d7a8-1f9d-413e-aab7-a7a7f1a1f05e-1
01:25:11.328 --> 01:25:12.600
have grown inside.

c8a13b80-ea2c-4990-b916-1bdf675dd6d4-0
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.030
OK so now.

a144c4c1-0e7b-418f-83fa-ad270f23fdc4-0
01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:23.708
But he he was concerned about
it, but not concerned enough to

a144c4c1-0e7b-418f-83fa-ad270f23fdc4-1
01:25:23.708 --> 01:25:25.280
get it, because it's still.

59c8a812-8b2e-4f93-85e6-a31ab62bb120-0
01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:32.940
um seems to be floating. Or is
it tied?

96966f04-6924-4e13-85f3-16559e6b64b7-0
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.300
Did they catch it? Is it tied
up? I can't tell.

71e1b2ac-6e46-4bf2-ab1b-b2da67b6ec7f-0
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:38.990
Seems to be floating free.

8c82069b-0196-4ad6-9432-0802b6f09f9f-0
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:40.810
But maybe.

91115c95-f7a3-49c5-9975-8e0784a1d060-0
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:43.630
Umm.

6b9b3dc7-f685-4913-8336-a299ae53d791-0
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.210
In this harbor, it still seems
to be floating free.

9aa0e3c4-30ae-4092-b3a9-11ca582617b3-0
01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.090
There's seagulls.

b489b3c2-c4d0-48db-b0bb-184184104a1c-0
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.270
{I don't know what to say.}

73ff3585-6b88-47cb-be03-5583c001aeab-0
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.610
{That I haven't already said.}

7a3e5372-0a74-4022-a775-33f9a4237ba8-0
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.770
{OK.}

6d0d7c6b-6d82-4f11-b62a-145e6686cfd4-0
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:12.120
OK, so now it's really making
its way into.

cd5a6aef-2213-4607-be5c-2391f3beefe5-0
01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:19.570
Into town, somehow the water
just looks like.

d6334a8e-1105-405a-8920-13fff51b3477-0
01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.210
Umm.

3a0b64b3-dcfe-4eae-b31f-65c7aa04354a-0
01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.521
This this town has roads of
water, so it's just going to

3a0b64b3-dcfe-4eae-b31f-65c7aa04354a-1
01:26:26.521 --> 01:26:30.767
float right into town right by
the buildings. Their lights are

3a0b64b3-dcfe-4eae-b31f-65c7aa04354a-2
01:26:30.767 --> 01:26:30.970
on.

a14144b5-ccd3-468e-bdf6-cdc7f728c9c5-0
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.120
Umm.

a1d36e04-32bc-4001-82ab-eca6ef67f23c-0
01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:39.058
Nobody. He was free. Nobody had
captured him. There is a boat

a1d36e04-32bc-4001-82ab-eca6ef67f23c-1
01:26:39.058 --> 01:26:43.406
behind him. I don't know if iy's
chasing him. There's several

a1d36e04-32bc-4001-82ab-eca6ef67f23c-2
01:26:43.406 --> 01:26:47.613
boats, lots of houses. Ohh
there's a creature up in the sky

a1d36e04-32bc-4001-82ab-eca6ef67f23c-3
01:26:47.613 --> 01:26:50.979
on one of the rooftops with
polka dots and big.

01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:56.900
I don't why they call them wings
or fins.

194560c7-cbd5-409a-86ed-5f7572d7d33f-0
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.450
got a propeller.

25a7a92c-ef2a-4d0b-b247-945a013249e2-0
01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:05.747
Several propellers on his back.
I have a feeling he's going to

25a7a92c-ef2a-4d0b-b247-945a013249e2-1
01:27:05.747 --> 01:27:07.870
come down for that paper boat.

a6bfba8c-a88b-4c94-ab5f-05ddbcbc9c85-0
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:10.100
OK.

fe9bc134-d96c-4a36-ab54-436f6382b023-0
01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.970
OK, now we're really getting
into the heart of the.

5f304a7a-ce5e-4ca7-be9b-615d0457a070-0
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:25.830
City.

95e58967-fb1d-419d-8854-676439351b8e-0
01:27:27.970 --> 01:27:28.390
And.

e98b7f45-8472-4ad3-baa2-8f42bb447b19-0
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:37.530
We see a giant snail shell.

4e0349f2-a042-4089-b78c-041a8a9f35e2-0
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:42.110
And rope, ladder and a cat in a
window.

964bee42-06a7-4626-b9ea-3c763e54061f-0
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.593
And what looks like a court
gesture with his arms spread

964bee42-06a7-4626-b9ea-3c763e54061f-1
01:27:48.593 --> 01:27:48.930
and.

283ef4bd-6a5e-4e1a-b068-78e65d55c010-0
01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.000
Little people carrying
something.

3498fe9e-5b3c-496b-810b-80553f7eccfb-0
01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:55.590
And.

c5e49abd-7941-4ff7-a645-7c1d48288858-0
01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.550
The deep sea diver.

09b77bdd-6bf3-47ef-aa88-07a00679d9b9-0
01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:04.900
And they're all looking at the
boat coming floating in to town.

646a9bdf-85b1-4455-8d2c-851229a84aa8-0
01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:08.310
Behind it is a bunch of.

987a0322-df53-4f41-bd18-7185348e35e3-0
01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:12.380
Stuff.

5cf39b66-c169-486f-a1aa-a4282befa1d1-0
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:15.520
Attached to a serpent.

da6199cb-2f83-48ad-9e44-6c52069da27c-0
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:21.811
Who seems to be looking at a man
sitting on the stairs. Well,

da6199cb-2f83-48ad-9e44-6c52069da27c-1
01:28:21.811 --> 01:28:23.840
here comes the here comes the.

8a40cead-1d65-44f6-ba64-1861ea877592-0
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:28.130
The paper boat the serpent,
doesn't seem to have seen it

8a40cead-1d65-44f6-ba64-1861ea877592-1
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:28.360
yet.

8955fab4-7780-40e7-a67d-a9414262d04b-0
01:28:30.330 --> 01:28:30.680
Hmm.

dbc2e274-a6d3-4a58-9b23-1f45b33d0348-0
01:28:33.610 --> 01:28:36.200
There's people up above under a
streetlight.

a87d33ff-e087-40f6-87a9-e69c7bd3bcc8-0
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:42.680
Still in the water, it's like
waves to me.

e2c4ffd4-2474-4d70-a973-477532ad4e70-0
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:44.960
Yeah.

a7103fd5-2aac-4534-b772-793c3c784faf-0
01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:52.870
The stars in the Sky Street
light steps going up to an upper

a7103fd5-2aac-4534-b772-793c3c784faf-1
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:55.740
level. There's a little boat
nearby.

1ba04ac2-83cf-47bd-9480-6fdf0401f1b1-0
01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:00.860
Buoys on it and what looks like
a.

61ce3efe-a99b-42aa-b5bc-a164cee357f7-0
01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.300
Little cabin.

d90c2202-41d7-4fd7-92e2-dc27a6a4ea25-0
01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:07.000
And another.

aab4dc67-35b5-4f7f-b637-e2798c91a985-0
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:13.370
Vessel of some sort, maybe in
the submarine?

64e7c386-ec78-4124-9e6e-0f1b3b1c9777-0
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.990
But it's just going right
between the two boats.

bcaac809-406e-4830-9110-e2ba3cc4c040-0
01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:19.200
Hmm.

b3b0d304-14bb-4f69-8635-9b6fcbce5a2f-0
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:31.540
Things seem calmer.

b4d7021e-13c5-478b-b9f3-6727eb724fad-0
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:37.992
Out of the heart of the city,
into an open area, open kind of

b4d7021e-13c5-478b-b9f3-6727eb724fad-1
01:29:37.992 --> 01:29:42.494
sort of open water and a
straight ahead is a wall, like a

b4d7021e-13c5-478b-b9f3-6727eb724fad-2
01:29:42.494 --> 01:29:47.307
brick wall with a small stone
building above it, on top of it

b4d7021e-13c5-478b-b9f3-6727eb724fad-3
01:29:47.307 --> 01:29:48.860
with a street light.

d1451150-53ed-4615-a5d6-e10da4200ca0-0
01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.060
Small door and two small
windows.

bdc695c6-305f-4fd9-b954-eb683229607b-0
01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:54.670
Nestled in the trees.

df7e6b25-1809-4f2b-8dea-63a4291b782d-0
01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.590
And the stars are in the sky.
Well, the boat

b2e092cf-250c-4173-9398-8614489b02f8-0
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:09.360
It's close enough that a little
figure.

5495f4f2-85ba-45eb-89d9-1d4d1b20f46a-0
01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.590
That apparently had been.

6baa467d-990c-4176-9d98-3ddfd9b8f355-0
01:30:12.250 --> 01:30:13.940
Staying in that boat.

68044efd-6817-4790-8fd0-e8b519d3a55a-0
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.820
Umm.

ac0e0a41-5fb0-45ba-bb86-8a151e0af4b5-0
01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.830
Manifests itself gets a little.

dd029820-0944-4e6e-9dc0-defe575c6f4c-0
01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:23.690
It's bigger and brighter and.

eff6d607-5690-4db3-b038-90b52b5fd033-0
01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:29.830
It parks the boat and goes up
the stairs and meets another.

e36ce218-5d58-40eb-ac23-c5d312a3b857-0
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.720
Figure.

35ae4439-7b3f-435d-abc2-9df396d5b9ff-0
01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.010
Another person.

eaebf381-b548-4c15-85d0-8fd87c9e03fa-0
01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.340
Person.

70fe8c15-c90a-4f61-bcee-640acb455743-0
01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:40.068
#END_wanderer Yeah, so now the
two people at least we just see

70fe8c15-c90a-4f61-bcee-640acb455743-1
01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:42.991
their legs. I assume it's two
people are standing at the top

70fe8c15-c90a-4f61-bcee-640acb455743-2
01:30:42.991 --> 01:30:45.100
of the stairs and the boat is
parked below.

{That was good. That was
horrible.}

01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:56.300
{Very weird.}

we'll be done and.}

e6782baf-a2f9-4892-bace-4e235eaff3fa-0

up.}

different day or we can finish

them up today. How do you feel?}

392228d0-4905-4bcf-9f58-7d0b4ea0cb3e-0

{Three more. So they have, yes.}

weird ones or are they more

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:46.716
straight through complex scenes?
So like the world, those those

02de3d67-9735-4196-9300-6145e813c577-2
01:31:46.716 --> 01:31:51.322
are a little better. Yeah, three
of those. Yeah, we can take a 2

02de3d67-9735-4196-9300-6145e813c577-3

back to finish those.}

Some museum.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:48.538
A space. It's a Museum of oh,
no. Yeah, OK. I don't know what

Ancient times, with a volcano

01:33:12.357 --> 01:33:13.820

Very small. There's a there's a
food line, and in the food line

0a6228db-3faa-4c12-af92-cbfcd9e1a317-1
01:33:47.162 --> 01:33:51.072
you can see some servers. They
all have hats in the chef. He's

0a6228db-3faa-4c12-af92-cbfcd9e1a317-2
01:33:51.072 --> 01:33:52.500
got the tall white hat.

cdd3e9cb-8fca-40a1-873c-08a8a9caf000-0
01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:59.762
Uh, we've got people of all
kinds in line there. We've got a

cdd3e9cb-8fca-40a1-873c-08a8a9caf000-1
01:33:59.762 --> 01:34:00.540
caveman and.

64665f68-f7e8-411c-b436-c006bd81fe56-0
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.870
a man With polka dot pants and

7c9ebe62-180c-4fd8-992f-07ef6d49b33a-0
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:15.368
Sort of a spaceman and just
normal men and women and sitting

7c9ebe62-180c-4fd8-992f-07ef6d49b33a-1
01:34:15.368 --> 01:34:20.870

f52caeb8-36b1-4e97-835c-cf9672133888-0

Pie.

7784963b-43cc-4fc3-b637-754cc8e79583-0
01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.776
And because it's pictured on a
poster on the wall and you get

7784963b-43cc-4fc3-b637-754cc8e79583-1
01:34:31.776 --> 01:34:31.950
it.

531d1eee-b75d-41c2-ab7f-92e702071a7c-0
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.830
Hamburger and you can get ice
cream cone.

b9b29eb4-d30f-469b-a6ef-47950acfed33-0
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:43.310
There are people sitting at
tables. There are people.

5314d1f7-687c-4ce4-97ee-1eaa71304620-0
01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.244
Just moving along the counter,
getting their food. There's a

5314d1f7-687c-4ce4-97ee-1eaa71304620-1
01:34:49.244 --> 01:34:54.495
cash register. There's a lot of
people in pink. There's a pink

5314d1f7-687c-4ce4-97ee-1eaa71304620-2
01:34:54.495 --> 01:34:59.080
floor pink. Pink is the color.
Pink outfit pink floor.

7d4661ed-d928-48ad-9f3e-015a7b9ab852-0
01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.636
What else is going on there?
There's somebody holding up a

7d4661ed-d928-48ad-9f3e-015a7b9ab852-1
01:35:04.636 --> 01:35:05.130
mirror.

92568bc9-76a1-466e-8331-ee6c062ea33f-0
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.610


c4711783-9b51-4d7b-9e01-b9fb724a808b-0
01:35:13.450 --> 01:35:18.043
{I just don't know what else to
say there.} OK, let's get out of

c4711783-9b51-4d7b-9e01-b9fb724a808b-1
01:35:18.043 --> 01:35:22.070
the cafeteria. Oh, there's a
just outside the cafeteria,

c4711783-9b51-4d7b-9e01-b9fb724a808b-2
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:26.240
there's a man carrying a pile of
123455 or six hamburgers.

f97bbfd8-aca1-43ab-9f0e-f90150cfe9cd-0
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.710
Um.

a5d8486e-3f36-4ca4-84eb-87107d280ed6-0
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:37.390
Behind the cafeteria is the
space part of the museum, and

a5d8486e-3f36-4ca4-84eb-87107d280ed6-1
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:42.720
there are flying saucers and
what looked like astronauts.

8f19b339-7ba6-4cac-b249-eac0e7301897-0
01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:49.115
Floating. And there's Saturn. So
we've got Saturn because you can

8f19b339-7ba6-4cac-b249-eac0e7301897-1
01:35:49.115 --> 01:35:54.084
tell because of its rings. And
there's a maybe just a worker

8f19b339-7ba6-4cac-b249-eac0e7301897-2
01:35:54.084 --> 01:35:59.460
taking a break sitting on one of
the rings of Saturn, and they're

8f19b339-7ba6-4cac-b249-eac0e7301897-3
01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.799
scaffolding and there's a
background of.

9a3abcee-b69d-4b91-9011-4a76d7f487c8-0
01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.541
Big Blue background just got
stars in it. There is what

9a3abcee-b69d-4b91-9011-4a76d7f487c8-1
01:36:08.541 --> 01:36:09.080
might.

9a2cdccd-8ca2-4951-b428-22bdb5fc223f-0
01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.500
They might be thinking that's
the surface of moon of the moon

9a2cdccd-8ca2-4951-b428-22bdb5fc223f-1
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:19.954
or something. It's blue and
hilly and they're. I guess

9a2cdccd-8ca2-4951-b428-22bdb5fc223f-2
01:36:19.954 --> 01:36:24.732
that's what the green. Maybe the
green characters are moon

9a2cdccd-8ca2-4951-b428-22bdb5fc223f-3
01:36:24.732 --> 01:36:29.105
creatures. There was one of
those having lunch in the

9a2cdccd-8ca2-4951-b428-22bdb5fc223f-4
01:36:29.105 --> 01:36:34.045
cafeteria. OK, space creatures.
Anyway, Umm, there's a space

9a2cdccd-8ca2-4951-b428-22bdb5fc223f-5
01:36:34.045 --> 01:36:34.449
ship.

bfc7f165-36b3-4dd5-8b22-c21f72635f92-0
01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:37.310
Umm.

438dce83-8cbe-4045-9ed1-be51e1389ece-0
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.230
There's a.

e3de648a-c335-4cbe-929d-993832cebc93-0
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:41.830
Probably.

5cc17db5-ca74-4ccb-99c9-92749fd7998b-0
01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:47.723
An engineer. He's the only one
in green, a Gray suit jacket,

5cc17db5-ca74-4ccb-99c9-92749fd7998b-1
01:36:47.723 --> 01:36:49.380
and he's holding up a.

75fbf56c-a6aa-46bd-a966-bfbb343f2e09-0
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:55.646
Poster of a rocket and the
poster says the point is

75fbf56c-a6aa-46bd-a966-bfbb343f2e09-1
01:36:55.646 --> 01:37:02.008
supposed to be going up and the
point of their is going down.

75fbf56c-a6aa-46bd-a966-bfbb343f2e09-2
01:37:02.008 --> 01:37:03.650
He's talking to.

a937c54f-9465-4b3d-8a39-e8e751e39147-0
01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.412
A bunch of people that are
visiting the museum. I guess

a937c54f-9465-4b3d-8a39-e8e751e39147-1
01:37:09.412 --> 01:37:10.780
they're listening.

df89e996-f60a-4b57-8aa0-9ad4934d2a64-0
01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.380
And they got a rope. Somebody's
got a rope.

a3a67ea5-e41d-4c3a-ae72-c985f1987b0f-0
01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.579
They've got a pickaxe and where
they're going to go try to fix

a3a67ea5-e41d-4c3a-ae72-c985f1987b0f-1
01:37:21.579 --> 01:37:25.560
it, I guess. These are all the
workers, I guess, that are going

a3a67ea5-e41d-4c3a-ae72-c985f1987b0f-2
01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.293
to come try to fix the upside
down rocket with a big wooden

a3a67ea5-e41d-4c3a-ae72-c985f1987b0f-3
01:37:29.293 --> 01:37:32.839
spoon. And we've got a medical
team coming. I'm not, oh,

a3a67ea5-e41d-4c3a-ae72-c985f1987b0f-4
01:37:32.839 --> 01:37:36.510
medical team coming because
we've got some astronauts that

a3a67ea5-e41d-4c3a-ae72-c985f1987b0f-5
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:38.190
have been injured, I guess.

47f3745b-33b8-4258-bf84-9cb7618dfb0c-0
01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:43.428
And then the pickaxe and the
rope to try to turn the rocket

47f3745b-33b8-4258-bf84-9cb7618dfb0c-1
01:37:43.428 --> 01:37:46.800
upside down. OK, over in the
caveman we have the volcano.

9d593126-2817-4cba-b214-57822bbcd020-0
01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.250
that has erupted and we've got
Cavemen sliding down the.

ce661c38-b687-4515-82dd-021ab7808719-0
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.411
The hill and we've got a green
dinosaur and a blue dinosaur and

ce661c38-b687-4515-82dd-021ab7808719-1
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:02.170
a red dinosaur and a couple of
red dinosaurs and.

d4c58b96-ccba-4617-9167-29d0f8fce375-0
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.225
Lot of Cavemen. Lot of them
scratching their heads. Where's

d4c58b96-ccba-4617-9167-29d0f8fce375-1
01:38:11.225 --> 01:38:11.920
cave women?

c3f8a09d-b759-4b64-95f4-458494d50a51-0
01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:16.546
Maybe. I don't know. They've all
got, most of them got beards,

c3f8a09d-b759-4b64-95f4-458494d50a51-1
01:38:16.546 --> 01:38:16.700
so.

d2cc3dc0-2d6e-43cf-b73d-916e2e5b490f-0
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:21.010
They're men. They're talking to
little green.

c4df54b2-0441-480f-a418-3c7b67cfb431-0
01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.590
Maybe not so little to green.

54f7f821-d881-4722-818e-27dd762168fa-0
01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.920
Creatures, and there are blue.

3fdac55e-dd5d-49a2-9fdc-d5e3ae118976-0
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:28.710
It's blue.

605fe7c2-7521-44e5-ac8d-1dfd2dc12244-0
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:34.560
Canisters on the ground do not
know what they would be.

ee35ab4d-adc2-4dc7-a8ea-17bfb68bcb04-0
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:39.890
for but they are throughout the
museum, these blue canisters.

03667548-2544-421f-895f-310d283d3538-0
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:44.350
Maybe they're time capsules or
something, I don't know.

f54888e1-3de4-48a2-be38-89de6dd11170-0
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:47.890
Maybe they're. Oh, maybe
they're.

355e0a8c-2730-4f07-844e-28dfd90fca28-0
01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:51.965
They're lights, they're light.
They're making a movie or some.

355e0a8c-2730-4f07-844e-28dfd90fca28-1
01:38:51.965 --> 01:38:54.972
They're lights, I see, because
down below, they're on OK.

355e0a8c-2730-4f07-844e-28dfd90fca28-2
01:38:54.972 --> 01:38:58.290
They're shining them all. That's
what they are. They're lights.

137c22cd-35ee-45ed-8347-93863a16234f-0
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.999
OK, they're making a movie. OK,
down below we have a mummy,

137c22cd-35ee-45ed-8347-93863a16234f-1
01:39:03.999 --> 01:39:08.310
several mummies. So they're
they're wrapping people.

9ed90054-c561-4158-a03e-a07c35db49f9-0
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:12.640
To look like mummies and.

cae8285f-2f69-462e-b202-f3db05e74a19-0
01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:19.580
There's trees, trees that look
like.

1578163c-465a-4943-960a-2f2b01ba583d-0
01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.135
Monsters. And there's OK, and
where they get ready, there are

1578163c-465a-4943-960a-2f2b01ba583d-1
01:39:25.135 --> 01:39:27.330
mirrors. Makeup room, I guess.

effa71b2-88fc-4901-ac18-0437e7f3650e-0
01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:33.416
There's a pink dinosaur in
there. There's a big star above

effa71b2-88fc-4901-ac18-0437e7f3650e-1
01:39:33.416 --> 01:39:33.630
the.

#END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
Above the door.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:41.919
{I don't know what else to say.
Is that enough? Yeah, that's

90a1dc6e-db74-417b-8e89-0306b735e754-1
01:39:41.919 --> 01:39:42.270
good.}

cfde6765-c88e-4641-8060-83d78ac6d086-0
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.820
{OK.}

4962961f-89b7-4949-9790-080f8f343b55-0
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:47.240
{More of those.}

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:49.220
{Yes.}

01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:57.997
#START_campsite Not so busy? OK,
well, we are camping now. Out

8d20cee7-236e-41ed-9efe-ea947521717c-1
01:39:57.997 --> 01:39:59.020
looks like.

99b62991-49b6-4584-a68a-e600e14eef10-0
01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:05.270
Out in the flat looks like Iowa.
That's where I'm from.

5d630587-32c8-4b49-ac51-6b0c60a2b28d-0
01:40:08.630 --> 01:40:11.388
Very flat, not very hilly.
Doesn't look like very

5d630587-32c8-4b49-ac51-6b0c60a2b28d-1
01:40:11.388 --> 01:40:13.320
interesting campground to me,
but.

17530f9c-10fd-4bbc-804d-ea203bc894cb-0
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:18.085
I'm not a camper. OK, so there's
a river running through the

17530f9c-10fd-4bbc-804d-ea203bc894cb-1
01:40:18.085 --> 01:40:21.860
middle of the campground and a
little bridge over the river.

17530f9c-10fd-4bbc-804d-ea203bc894cb-2
01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:24.460
This one's pretty easy. Couple
of little.

a4e35a32-eeb9-49d2-b214-816a23ae0d9d-0
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:29.941
One paddle boat and one other
little boat in the river.

a4e35a32-eeb9-49d2-b214-816a23ae0d9d-1
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:34.084
There's a mermaid or two
mermaids in the water, OK? They

a4e35a32-eeb9-49d2-b214-816a23ae0d9d-2
01:40:34.084 --> 01:40:36.920

TP's.

01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:40.560

like.

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:46.890
Like from the circus. And then
on the other side of the bridge

f478114f-5643-49b9-b7a2-918dd774c230-1
01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:51.297
there are more campers because
you can see the wheel, so

f478114f-5643-49b9-b7a2-918dd774c230-2
01:40:51.297 --> 01:40:56.322
they've driven theirs in. On the
road behind the campers Camping

f478114f-5643-49b9-b7a2-918dd774c230-3
01:40:56.322 --> 01:40:59.570
Camper area, you see bicycles I

01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:04.451
I was gonna say unicycle, but
it's not. It's just an old

3968c12b-de0e-4e0c-9f63-f854b90de885-1
01:41:04.451 --> 01:41:08.326
bicycle with one really big
wheel and one small wheel. There

3968c12b-de0e-4e0c-9f63-f854b90de885-2
01:41:08.326 --> 01:41:12.264
are some joggers there. What is
way out in the field? I don't

3968c12b-de0e-4e0c-9f63-f854b90de885-3
01:41:12.264 --> 01:41:15.060

the field.

01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:19.660
And a man with a shotgun. I
don't know what he's doing.

d8810c84-bfdf-4bd0-b631-5694ce4614c6-0
01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.602

01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:32.618
There's someone fishing in the
river, sitting on the edge,

1e4f3928-8284-43e5-b823-8262ff496907-1
01:41:32.618 --> 01:41:36.835
fishing. He might catch a
mermaid. There are some Scouts,

1e4f3928-8284-43e5-b823-8262ff496907-2

You can see their hats and their
uniforms and their scarves,

c70238c3-b466-4ee0-b84f-c39508a71db9-1
01:41:47.597 --> 01:41:49.730

01:41:55.462 --> 01:41:59.694
on fire. Somebody was grilling
and the smoke from the grill

f1dd5641-6333-455a-beb2-f8abc06c0d4b-2
01:41:59.694 --> 01:42:01.740

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:48.690

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:53.690
And he's not paying attention,
and he's spilling his, the

7f9d6ed5-7c5d-4d54-a7e7-f1164d3e47f5-1
01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:55.870
