00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.520
{Now.

31d5a291-c14b-456f-b094-1eed73e4f692-0
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.891
OK. So continuing with our
study, this next item is a

31d5a291-c14b-456f-b094-1eed73e4f692-1
00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:11.681
graphic novel. So just to remind
you, describe what you see and

31d5a291-c14b-456f-b094-1eed73e4f692-2
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:16.247
what is happening as you go
through the story and in between

31d5a291-c14b-456f-b094-1eed73e4f692-3
00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:19.990
10 and 15 minutes, this one has
around 11 pages.}

d9c33ce2-1826-4713-91a6-c19d42779ce4-0
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.035
#START_flowerman so, um, two
page spread on the left, there's

d9c33ce2-1826-4713-91a6-c19d42779ce4-1
00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:30.937
a walkway with the bridge, and
there's some lampposts on the

d9c33ce2-1826-4713-91a6-c19d42779ce4-2
00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:34.967
the walkway. On the bridge part
of it, there's a man wearing a

d9c33ce2-1826-4713-91a6-c19d42779ce4-3
00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.805
green jacket and the hat, and it
looks like he has a little

d9c33ce2-1826-4713-91a6-c19d42779ce4-4
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.940
animal next to him and he's
crossing the bridge.

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-0
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.881
And the other side there is
looks like like a little town.

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-1
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.529
There's a store that says gas.
There's a Ferris wheel, like a

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-2
00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:54.118
tent, like a circus tent. Next
to the Ferris wheel there's a

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-3
00:00:54.118 --> 00:00:57.531
couple buildings, one that says
bar, there's an old truck

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-4
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:01.002
building that says bait shop.
And then there's some stairs

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-5
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.709
going up to some the 2nd floor
around the other buildings. And

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-6
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.357
then there's one other man who
was walking on the sidewalk on

4bf44a41-2a14-4217-a208-f36bd09785ee-7
00:01:08.357 --> 00:01:09.770
that side of the street.

73dd2578-907a-4fdf-9c97-32db889a1070-0
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.734
Uh, so under the bridge is like
it looks like it dried up river

73dd2578-907a-4fdf-9c97-32db889a1070-1
00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:17.793
and then dried it up river.
There's like a a rowboat

73dd2578-907a-4fdf-9c97-32db889a1070-2
00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:21.487
sticking out. There's an old car
on the edge of the hill there,

73dd2578-907a-4fdf-9c97-32db889a1070-3
00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:24.720
and looks like there's an anchor
as well at the bottom.

5fe7461f-a6ca-46cc-80f3-34312d3fb1b1-0
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.293
And then there's like a beat up
wooden dock, but it's kind of

5fe7461f-a6ca-46cc-80f3-34312d3fb1b1-1
00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:29.770
falling apart and falling down.

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-0
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.360
OK, so now you see the guy is
walking on the sidewalk in the

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-1
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.464
town. Now he has looks like it's
actually blue. He has an orange

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-2
00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:45.567
scarf and he's cold in a yellow
bag and a blue umbrella and he's

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-3
00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.102
walking down the sidewalk. It's
all Gray and white. The

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-4
00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:52.258
building. So it looks like
there's some old stone

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-5
00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:56.236
buildings. One next to them has
a couple stairs, trash can and

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-6
00:01:56.236 --> 00:02:00.402
look like there's two people who
have kind of in an alleyway, man

cb725388-ca97-4921-b06e-09d86c065b29-7
00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:01.160
and a woman.

2ad07285-6a95-467f-8866-797f0ac6eed5-0
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.172
Umm, and then over behind them,
on the other side of this, the

2ad07285-6a95-467f-8866-797f0ac6eed5-1
00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:08.178
street, there's a couple
buildings, windows. Looks like

2ad07285-6a95-467f-8866-797f0ac6eed5-2
00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:11.507
there's some writing on the one
windows, but everything looks

2ad07285-6a95-467f-8866-797f0ac6eed5-3
00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:12.420
like it's closed.

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-0
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.191
 I turn a little bit to the left
of where he is Um, down the next

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-1
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:21.492
street and there's a little kid
walking on the sidewalk.

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-2
00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:25.139
Somebody's on a motorcycle on
the street. One of the buildings

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-3
00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.671
says CAFE, and it looks like
there are some people up on the

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-4
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:32.261
second and third story of that
building. And then down below,

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-5
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:35.330
underneath the cafe sign,
there's a street light and

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-6
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.036
there's a man standing, leaning
on the building. There's also a

dcf6774e-2cbf-42ca-ba90-2af4d536ff8a-7
00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:41.699
car with a a man driving the car
next to him.

bc4b705f-5914-4993-ac5c-beb5a1a25193-0
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.590
And then in the center there is
like a little statue and looks

bc4b705f-5914-4993-ac5c-beb5a1a25193-1
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.140
like somebody on a horse the
statue in the center.

ac12b75f-28dc-4c7b-9aa8-1629fb60a13a-0
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.965
And then in the foreground and
the bottom right of the picture,

ac12b75f-28dc-4c7b-9aa8-1629fb60a13a-1
00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:56.178
there is like a second story, a
little patio with somebody

ac12b75f-28dc-4c7b-9aa8-1629fb60a13a-2
00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:59.608
standing on the patio and looks
like there's a little cat next

ac12b75f-28dc-4c7b-9aa8-1629fb60a13a-3
00:02:59.608 --> 00:02:59.990
to her.

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-0
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.566
So now he is walking up to the
house. It looks like it says for

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-1
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:12.245
sale, but it looks a little beat
up. And there's a a street light

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-2
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:15.923
above him and there's looks like
he has a little dog next to him.

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-3
00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:19.267
And then around the corner from
him there's a couple people

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-4
00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:22.889
standing on the sidewalk kind of
looking over, and that building

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-5
00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.289
has a door with a clock right
above it. And upstairs there's

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-6
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.744
people in the second and third
floor of those windows. At the

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-7
00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:33.199
top of that building, there's a
little telescope. Nobody's up

892c8c5f-690c-498a-a737-2e2e5950c61a-8
00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.980
there, though.

85f20fc7-601d-4523-9f57-68fe6ed1cc16-0
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.840
Um, and then the bottom left of
that building just looks like

85f20fc7-601d-4523-9f57-68fe6ed1cc16-1
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.200
there's somebody sitting on a
chair on the sidewalk.

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-0
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.615
And then right next to his, the
house that he's looking at has

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-1
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:47.552
the for sale sign. There's a
tree and there's a couple

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-2
00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:50.864
buildings behind that and you
can see the windows are open on

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-3
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:54.283
the second and third stories and
there's people inside. So next

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-4
00:03:54.283 --> 00:03:57.595
to the house and the beat up
little for sale house, there's a

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-5
00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:00.906
brick building, 2 stories and
looks like the windows are open

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-6
00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:04.165
or at least you can see, and
that there's people upstairs as

c8e14b22-b8dd-4737-95f7-b403f7f0f584-7
00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:05.180
well as downstairs.

58b0d0aa-3654-456f-b050-d49d9e4fd2b0-0
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.575
And then keep going to the next
building. Then there's a woman

58b0d0aa-3654-456f-b050-d49d9e4fd2b0-1
00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:12.474
walking into that building up
the stairs. And then the second

58b0d0aa-3654-456f-b050-d49d9e4fd2b0-2
00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:15.233
story. Also the doors, the
windows are open so you can see

58b0d0aa-3654-456f-b050-d49d9e4fd2b0-3
00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:16.870
the click. There's a guy
painting.

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-0
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.810
And then on the street, right
where there's a little like a

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-1
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.603
fountain circle, there's
somebody sitting on the edge of

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-2
00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:27.739
that and looks like also a kid
leaning on the edge of that. And

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-3
00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:30.434
then another building on the
other side of the street,

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-4
00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:33.130
there's a couple people, two
guys standing, leaning up

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-5
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.923
against underneath like a
striped awning. And then there

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-6
00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:38.863
is a couple more people on the
street, looks like there's a

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-7
00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:41.803
child. And then for all the
buildings looks like the second

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-8
00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:44.890
and third story windows. You can
see there's people inside and

c4461d28-0e6a-4b93-b6af-3a861dfe03f1-9
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.900
different ages and different
activities.

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-0
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.740
OK, so now it's essentially the
same picture, except that

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-1
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.248
there's a lot more people about
and his little for sale house

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-2
00:04:58.248 --> 00:05:01.189
actually has color now.
Everything else is Gray and

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-3
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.527
white still. So his house is
white, purple roof, just like

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-4
00:05:04.527 --> 00:05:07.808
like a little one story with
like a like an added kind of

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-5
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:11.202
space. There's blue shutters,
looks like he's fixing up the

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-6
00:05:11.202 --> 00:05:14.709
house. The grass is green now.
There's a little lawn mower in

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-7
00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:18.216
the front, and there's a brown
picket fence. There's a little

e1da5fca-8463-40dd-ad7c-778ffe8b77fa-8
00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:20.309
girl leaning over the fence
looking.

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-0
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.216
In the street, there's somebody
on a scooter with a helmet.

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-1
00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:26.863
There's somebody in a
wheelchair, looks like what

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-2
00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:29.827
their leg is in a cast, and
there's a couple. There's a

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-3
00:05:29.827 --> 00:05:32.950
woman, she looks like she's
wearing some fancy clothes and

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-4
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.179
fancy scarf, and a little girl
next to her. There's a guy in

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-5
00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:39.038
suspenders, another guy looks
like in the suit with a

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-6
00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:42.214
briefcase. There's still the
person sitting on the chair on

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-7
00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:45.285
the left next to that building,
and there's a little girl

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-8
00:05:45.285 --> 00:05:48.355
outside the building as well.
The tree next to his little

405560e2-89b7-4d5a-b812-7026f117ae67-9
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.419
house is also in colorful now as
well.

2fe2abfa-7eb6-432c-956c-e1017c4df04c-0
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.614
I'm on the other side of the
picture, so on the other side of

2fe2abfa-7eb6-432c-956c-e1017c4df04c-1
00:05:53.614 --> 00:05:54.020
his house.

0b3ef19b-4c2e-432e-aab7-3fa41cc0bf90-0
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.270
There looks like there's
somebody walking up stairs.

65e36d6a-3613-40d5-81c2-151fd9dafd8b-0
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.463
Like a milkman, because he's in
all white, looks like he's

65e36d6a-3613-40d5-81c2-151fd9dafd8b-1
00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:04.307
carrying something. And then
there's a couple other girls,

65e36d6a-3613-40d5-81c2-151fd9dafd8b-2
00:06:04.307 --> 00:06:07.343
like on the sidewalk, they're
talking. Some kids in the street

65e36d6a-3613-40d5-81c2-151fd9dafd8b-3
00:06:07.343 --> 00:06:09.946
are playing with the ball and
there's looks like some

65e36d6a-3613-40d5-81c2-151fd9dafd8b-4
00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:12.982
musicians sitting on the edge of
the one building, like on the

65e36d6a-3613-40d5-81c2-151fd9dafd8b-5
00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:13.320
stairs.

5c6f19e6-009c-4ccc-9db6-dc634bb57ee2-0
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.708
And there's some more people on
the street on the other side,

5c6f19e6-009c-4ccc-9db6-dc634bb57ee2-1
00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:20.967
and there all the windows again
are open on the second and third

5c6f19e6-009c-4ccc-9db6-dc634bb57ee2-2
00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:23.876
floor. You can see people in
some of the windows, but not

5c6f19e6-009c-4ccc-9db6-dc634bb57ee2-3
00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:25.230
necessarily in all of them.

1a72ceac-e657-4c71-9006-073a019121b6-0
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.270
OK, so same picture.

e987a1d7-0edc-46e3-a057-6ea2845b23e5-0
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.549
Our house is colorful. There's
more flowers now. The grass is

e987a1d7-0edc-46e3-a057-6ea2845b23e5-1
00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:39.745
still green. His little house is
still purple and white and blue

e987a1d7-0edc-46e3-a057-6ea2845b23e5-2
00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:42.794
shutters. And then there's lots
of flowers like in the window

e987a1d7-0edc-46e3-a057-6ea2845b23e5-3
00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:45.892
boxes and the chimneys colorful.
And the tree next to it's all

e987a1d7-0edc-46e3-a057-6ea2845b23e5-4
00:06:45.892 --> 00:06:48.450
colorful. Everything else is
still black and white.

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-0
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.875
Um, he looks like he might be a
little bit older. He looks like

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-1
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:56.255
he's gray, but I'm not sure. And
then next to him there's a

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-2
00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:59.804
lamppost with somebody leaning
up against it, and there's some

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-3
00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:03.184
kids in the street talking.
There's people in the back left

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-4
00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:06.677
now, the kids in the back left
part of the street now playing

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-5
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:10.395
ball. And then on the right side
of his house there's somebody on

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-6
00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:13.775
their scooter. There's a girl
who now is also in color. She

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-7
00:07:13.775 --> 00:07:17.324
has red hair, yellow shirt and
blue skirt, but everything else

e5f41d32-c127-415b-b015-f9a46e6349e7-8
00:07:17.324 --> 00:07:19.239
around her still black and
white.

91d264af-973b-42f5-b153-3578b28f5e13-0
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.803
There's people going upstairs to
that building and there's people

91d264af-973b-42f5-b153-3578b28f5e13-1
00:07:22.803 --> 00:07:25.570
in the windows next to that.
Looks like there's like the

91d264af-973b-42f5-b153-3578b28f5e13-2
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.725
milkman again at the next house.
The guy who was painting on the

91d264af-973b-42f5-b153-3578b28f5e13-3
00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:31.492
second story is now kind of
hanging up there, the window

91d264af-973b-42f5-b153-3578b28f5e13-4
00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:32.560
edge with his palette.

d01f7fdf-31fc-4baf-b3e8-05730ddc0b48-0
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.914
And then there's a truck in the
street, and there's a guy with a

d01f7fdf-31fc-4baf-b3e8-05730ddc0b48-1
00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.420
cart in the street as well.

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-0
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.483
So now more. Most of the
pictures coming in the color

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-1
00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:47.841
now. So the guy still in front
of his house and there's a woman

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-2
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:51.041
next to him with red hair and a
green jacket and blue skirt.

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-3
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:54.137
There's somebody else next to
him also in color, red hair,

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-4
00:07:54.137 --> 00:07:57.180
purple pants. And there's a
couple kids on the street. In

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-5
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.118
front of them are also looks
like there's a little girl

dd9a1d9e-2a39-455f-89c1-d20b2d67b9d0-6
00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:01.219
playing with the dog.

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-0
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.446
And then there's a boy who's
also talking to the guy with the

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-1
00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:08.912
with the house. And then next to
the House there's that lamppost

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-2
00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:12.005
and there's a guy and it's like
a dress shirt and red tie

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-3
00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:14.938
sitting next to it in the
background. Looks like there

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-4
00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:18.458
might be a clown. Maybe it looks
like he's wearing white and then

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-5
00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.711
has like a Red Nose and mouth.
And that's to the left of his

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-6
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:25.017
house. And then on the across
the street from his house, that

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-7
00:08:25.017 --> 00:08:28.163
building is now in color gray
red shutters. There's people

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-8
00:08:28.163 --> 00:08:31.363
upstairs. The roof is kind of
colorful and there's a little

f3d710ad-efa7-40ee-9e18-cb77d81ef27f-9
00:08:31.363 --> 00:08:32.109
girl in front.

1c592989-ea29-4d86-ad3d-da20f8aac77e-0
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.200
Hugging some an older man. And
then there's like posters on the

1c592989-ea29-4d86-ad3d-da20f8aac77e-1
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.220
side of the building. There's a
red fire hydrant there as well.

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-0
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.526
And then some of the windows on
the second and third stories,

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-1
00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:46.365
some of the buildings are now in
color. You can see people inside

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-2
00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:49.739
little bit easier. So the right
of his house there's that

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-3
00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:53.461
building is half in color, half
and not color on the top story.

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-4
00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:57.301
I mean the second story there is
a man looks like might be taking

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-5
00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:00.965
a bath and then there's a red
brick, purple shutters or I mean

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-6
00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:04.630
on purple striped awning. And
then underneath there's a movers

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-7
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.178
and shakers truck, looks like
there's people moving boxes in

af8def0b-bbfd-4d3e-bf66-e802256cba29-8
00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:09.400
boxes into the truck.

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-0
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.541
And then there's a little kid
playing at that fountain on the

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-1
00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:17.094
bottom right now he's in color,
and then the artist is in color

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-2
00:09:17.094 --> 00:09:20.480
above, and that's next house
over. And then the house beside

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-3
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.033
that you can also see there's a
truck coming around the corners

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-4
00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:27.308
and color. And then there's some
trees, there's the houses

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-5
00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:30.972
itself, a little bit more color,
some of the people on the street

aa385757-d818-4891-a395-4fc9efcd06ce-6
00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:31.250
also.

413103d9-4d72-4af7-9b7c-2592aa5f1f3d-0
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.810
OK, so now all of the pictures
in color.

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-0
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.545
So the the guy in his house now
has a little BBQ outside and a

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-1
00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:45.848
couple. There's like a dog in
this in his yard as well.

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-2
00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:49.386
There's another lady and some
kids in his yard. There's the

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-3
00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:53.043
person in the wheelchair with
the cast on the street. There's

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-4
00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:56.640
a couple kids with the ball and
a dog in the street as well.

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-5
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.061
Looks like the milkman's now
dancing with the girl on the

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-6
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:03.835
left. And then you can actually
see there's a milk truck behind

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-7
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:07.551
him with the cow on it. There's
a musician playing and leaning

c98d6eb1-71af-4f8d-aa40-b6aee1fe6b9a-8
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:08.790
against the building.

f3cb42cb-10c2-4218-9453-0843d4b9eac4-0
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.670
Next to that truck.

b02a5365-65bf-4e8a-ab4d-7d5a93d6b09d-0
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.650
And then all the windows
upstairs and everything are all

b02a5365-65bf-4e8a-ab4d-7d5a93d6b09d-1

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.752
little red car next to the boy
still at the fountain, and

b02a5365-65bf-4e8a-ab4d-7d5a93d6b09d-9

the same place it was before,

00:11:20.306 --> 00:11:23.491

she's in the pink dress and
she's talking to a man. And then

ecb84929-fb8a-4453-8f40-2b7417a9ff33-8
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:39.518
in the street you'll see there's
a couple kids and there's a

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.401
Like one woman and a brick house
to the right of his house. The

83046cd1-e0e9-4410-9d8d-9d94682daa99-1
00:11:55.401 --> 00:11:58.464

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.232
And then the house next to
there, there's a guy in a white

539f580a-55a6-4569-93a2-a2ede2bc69cd-1
00:12:05.232 --> 00:12:08.478

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.724
holding something in his arms.
And and then in the street

539f580a-55a6-4569-93a2-a2ede2bc69cd-3
00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:14.914
there's a woman and a daughter
and she's holding a baby.

539f580a-55a6-4569-93a2-a2ede2bc69cd-4
00:12:14.914 --> 00:12:18.272
There's an older couple on the
street and then there's some

539f580a-55a6-4569-93a2-a2ede2bc69cd-5
00:12:18.272 --> 00:12:21.909

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.952
So then it goes back to him
walking, the man walking away in

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-1
00:12:28.952 --> 00:12:32.344
the same street that he came in
originally, he's it's like a

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-2

cross intersection and he has a
blue hat, green jacket. He's

00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:39.406
walking away. There's a lamppost
on, looks like it's evening now.

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-4
00:12:39.406 --> 00:12:42.632
And then there's a guy on the
street behind him. And then

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-5
00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:46.135
around the corner of that street
there's a man on a motorcycle

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-6
00:12:46.135 --> 00:12:49.805
and there's some people talking.
There's a man, catty corner from

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-7
00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:53.086
him. There's a building that
said Cafe, and you see people

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-8
00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:56.311
upstairs in the windows and
there's a man leaning against

804c867b-ace2-41a9-af96-55d821830e50-9
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:56.590
that.

0cf7567b-6636-45f4-a859-faa2b2915cfb-0
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.978
In that building and then the
bottom right of the picture, you

0cf7567b-6636-45f4-a859-faa2b2915cfb-1
00:12:59.978 --> 00:13:03.207

outside and they're flowers and

0cf7567b-6636-45f4-a859-faa2b2915cfb-3
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:07.820
everything's nice and colorful.

8b7dfe78-c326-4f88-aba2-b0e04e7f4206-0
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.214
And yeah, that's about it. Most
of the houses are all colorful

8b7dfe78-c326-4f88-aba2-b0e04e7f4206-1
00:13:13.214 --> 00:13:16.508

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:19.437
like a cross intersection.
There's like a little circle

8b7dfe78-c326-4f88-aba2-b0e04e7f4206-3
00:13:19.437 --> 00:13:22.208

there's a dog. There's one of
the cars in the street and most

8b7dfe78-c326-4f88-aba2-b0e04e7f4206-5

00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:31.673
looks like he's holding
something in his hand and he's

8b7dfe78-c326-4f88-aba2-b0e04e7f4206-7
00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:34.863
up in front of another house

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.315
Also in color at that stoop of
that house. And there's people

7781c56c-274c-4bc5-b0b3-22b5206282a5-1

#END_flowerman And then there's
like a stoop, and you can see

c1c48fe2-3cd8-41d4-875e-6d498c1fbbae-1
00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:58.481

00:14:04.988 --> 00:14:08.189
mouse on her shoulder. And then
there's a man in the window

c1c48fe2-3cd8-41d4-875e-6d498c1fbbae-5
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:11.549

#START_deep_sea_divers Uh, so it
looks like this picture is about

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-1
00:14:37.492 --> 00:14:40.395
deep sea divers. It's like a
cross section of water. So you

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-2
00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:43.152
can see on the top there is a
bunch of boats and there's

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-3
00:14:43.152 --> 00:14:46.152
stripe boats, red and white,
blue and white, green and white.

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:49.102
And there's different people
numbers of people on the boats,

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-5
00:14:49.102 --> 00:14:52.102
most of them are fishing and and
then you also see one of the

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-6
00:14:52.102 --> 00:14:54.859
boat kind of seems to be
capsizing or going under on the

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-7
00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:57.859
on the right side and there's
some people in the water around

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-8
00:14:57.859 --> 00:15:00.858
it. There's a little mountain
rock sticking out of the out of

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-9
00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.760
the water on the top right when
there's some people who are

553c2409-a798-4584-b497-f7b7307edc25-10
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.680

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.235
fishing off that rock and and
then a little bit to the left of

69de40cc-b8b4-4caf-8a47-d0357a876062-1
00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:11.721
that, there's another pile of
rocks coming up out of the water

69de40cc-b8b4-4caf-8a47-d0357a876062-2
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:15.207
and there's a bunch of mermaids
on top of that one and there's

69de40cc-b8b4-4caf-8a47-d0357a876062-3
00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:17.310
one guy who is sitting there as
well.

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-0
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.537
And then to the left of that, a
little bit further in the

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-1
00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:24.572
background, you see another pile
of rocks and there's a bunch of

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-2
00:15:24.572 --> 00:15:27.373
fish that are jumping over it
and the nice little arch. And

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-3
00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:29.988
then you see some dolphins
coming out of the water. And

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-4
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:32.836
then there's another pile of
rocks where there's some people

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-5
00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:35.684
who are fishing. And the one
that looks like the fishing rod

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-6
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:38.392
at the bottom, they picked up
another person instead of a

dfa7979b-e715-47d4-a8a1-c39770065f48-7
00:15:38.392 --> 00:15:40.540
fish. So there's a person
hanging in the air.

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-0
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.401
And then, so if you go into the
water itself on the left, you'll

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-1
00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:48.432
see there's somebody who's
dropping an anchor into the

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-2
00:15:48.432 --> 00:15:51.738
water. There's people who have
like like little scuba gears

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-3
00:15:51.738 --> 00:15:55.044
with you can see the bubbles
coming up around them. There's

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-4
00:15:55.044 --> 00:15:58.460
people, there's like a little a
net handheld net in the water

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-5
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.766
and there's actually a fish
holding a handheld net scooping

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-6
00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:05.072
about the scoop up person in one
of the picture part of the

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-7
00:16:05.072 --> 00:16:08.598
pictures further down, you can
see there's like a swordfish and

dc88c7d7-ffac-4ad1-a7e2-3135badd3c5f-8
00:16:08.598 --> 00:16:11.960
then there's coral at the bottom
of the water at the bottom.

16d01285-356d-442f-9aa3-dccdbef99bb5-0
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.040
With the sand and there's people
dancing down there.

cbb639c5-33f1-4b92-a8ce-c6319689b851-0
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.299
Some of them have the one has a
very long looks, like a very

cbb639c5-33f1-4b92-a8ce-c6319689b851-1
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:23.906
long pole, or going up into the
up into the surface of the

cbb639c5-33f1-4b92-a8ce-c6319689b851-2
00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:27.758
water, there's some coral. One
actually looks like a hand. The

cbb639c5-33f1-4b92-a8ce-c6319689b851-3
00:16:27.758 --> 00:16:31.060
one piece of coral there's
towards the bottom center,

cbb639c5-33f1-4b92-a8ce-c6319689b851-4
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.544
there's green octopus over a
rock and there's a bunch of

cbb639c5-33f1-4b92-a8ce-c6319689b851-5
00:16:34.544 --> 00:16:35.890
people in front of it.

077edc93-4e71-40c7-b857-a727883ff21e-0
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.615
There is somebody who is tied to
another long rope and there's a

077edc93-4e71-40c7-b857-a727883ff21e-1
00:16:40.615 --> 00:16:43.661
tied around his chest and he's
in a piece of pink coral. And

077edc93-4e71-40c7-b857-a727883ff21e-2
00:16:43.661 --> 00:16:46.556
then to the right of that
there's a big rock and it looks

077edc93-4e71-40c7-b857-a727883ff21e-3
00:16:46.556 --> 00:16:49.652
like it's rock, but there's a
face on it on the right side of

077edc93-4e71-40c7-b857-a727883ff21e-4
00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.400
it and we have some teeth as
well.

37dfc111-dd87-4da1-909d-6f251cf6fcb1-0
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.495
On the bottom right corner there
is a little chest. It looks like

37dfc111-dd87-4da1-909d-6f251cf6fcb1-1
00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:58.231
there's some people opening the
chest and there's a little red

37dfc111-dd87-4da1-909d-6f251cf6fcb1-2
00:16:58.231 --> 00:16:59.360
creature coming out of it.

87d590a2-1d23-4731-9c61-e6b47fb3b50a-0
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.493
There is a school of fish that's
shaped like a redfish and

87d590a2-1d23-4731-9c61-e6b47fb3b50a-1
00:17:04.493 --> 00:17:08.300
there's some blue fish in the
middle of it. There's some fish

87d590a2-1d23-4731-9c61-e6b47fb3b50a-2
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.160
that are also.

a811f450-96d0-4efd-b049-bcb30eafb27f-0
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.151
Shaped into like 3 arrows
pointing to the right. And

a811f450-96d0-4efd-b049-bcb30eafb27f-1
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:16.544
there's people in front of those
arrows with fishing Nets and

a811f450-96d0-4efd-b049-bcb30eafb27f-2
00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:20.157
there's some turtles around them
as well. There's a circle in the

a811f450-96d0-4efd-b049-bcb30eafb27f-3
00:17:20.157 --> 00:17:23.715
middle of the water area that's
a that's another school of fish.

a811f450-96d0-4efd-b049-bcb30eafb27f-4
00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:27.054
It's like a red circle with blue
eyes and like, you know, it

a811f450-96d0-4efd-b049-bcb30eafb27f-5
00:17:27.054 --> 00:17:30.120
looks like blue eyes and a
yellow nose and green mouth.

da585ed0-8adf-4857-9487-a6d309db339e-0
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.918
#END_deep_sea_divers And see,
there's some other little like

da585ed0-8adf-4857-9487-a6d309db339e-1
00:17:35.918 --> 00:17:39.308
jellyfish right above that.
There's a bunch of blue fish

da585ed0-8adf-4857-9487-a6d309db339e-2
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.520
around the one person there's
swimming away from him.

c1121830-85e2-4579-8ed6-91b3ff158390-0
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.250
{And.

2cf92e7f-97de-48ec-8b33-90395d3d4799-0
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.030
No, that's about it.

425e87fa-0a58-459f-9637-ce6052cdc85e-0
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.930
Yeah, that was about 3 minutes
could.}

bfe24532-bec5-4ff8-a513-81b4318769b9-0
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.571
{I'm going to this construction
going on. I'm going to move a

bfe24532-bec5-4ff8-a513-81b4318769b9-1
00:17:56.571 --> 00:17:57.300
little, OK?}

6fd8c950-e5ba-4197-8aa2-28c8e7a1bda0-0
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.670
{Excuse me?

fc894102-2608-42e5-bfb3-8f131ba04a7b-0
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.380
So moving on to the next one.

cfd47377-7ae9-42d1-896d-45a3a808065d-0
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.570
So this one again is a complex
scene.}

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-0
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.449
{And you can start when you're
ready.} #START_airport So it

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-1
00:18:20.449 --> 00:18:23.445
looks like they're at an
airport, like on the tarmac. You

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-2
00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:26.596
can see parts of the building on
the left of the air traffic

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-3
00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:29.798
control towards the top left,
and then you'll see part of the

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-4
00:18:29.798 --> 00:18:32.794
building. It's almost like you
can kind of see inside the

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-5
00:18:32.794 --> 00:18:35.790
building on the bottom part of
the screen. So you can see

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-6
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.941
people going up to a counter,
somebody's opening their coat,

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-7
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.196
and it looks like the security
people. And he has all kinds of

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-8
00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:45.295
knives on his coat and on his
shirt. There's like a baggage

a42c995a-f0b5-4bf1-8ed1-9300412a296e-9
00:18:45.295 --> 00:18:46.690
claim area that's circular.

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-0
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.780
In the bottom left, people are
grabbing their bags and there's

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-1
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.561
a little boy in the baggage
claim and then there's people

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-2
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:55.582
walking through the airport and
more towards the right. You'll

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-3
00:18:55.582 --> 00:18:58.603
see that there's people on their
checking their bags, but they

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-4
00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:01.767
have some bags that are going up
against to the people who are at

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-5
00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:04.596
the counter and there's a
conveyor belt behind them at the

1e84458d-c500-4714-a78e-60176c79c53b-6
00:19:04.596 --> 00:19:04.979
counter.

07c2d4f6-41f2-46d0-a66e-1bd40caf0075-0
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.087
So and then the rest of the
screen is like the outdoor part

07c2d4f6-41f2-46d0-a66e-1bd40caf0075-1
00:19:10.087 --> 00:19:13.150
of it, and it's like a tarmac
and there's a bunch of boxes and

07c2d4f6-41f2-46d0-a66e-1bd40caf0075-2
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.117
cargo boxes towards the bottom
right, and there's a guy with

07c2d4f6-41f2-46d0-a66e-1bd40caf0075-3
00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:18.840
like a forklift and it actually
has a fork on the lift.

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-0
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.452
And then there's some carts with
the baggage, um on those, like

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-1
00:19:23.452 --> 00:19:26.781
the baggage carts that go to the
back and forth of the planes.

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-2
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:29.846
There's some flight attendants
who are getting off on the

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-3
00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:33.070
planes and there's some people
who are getting off the plane

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-4
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.188
and going to the left, going
towards the building. There's

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-5
00:19:36.188 --> 00:19:39.570
some refueling trucks and might
probably behind that plane. And

bf313ec1-2b1e-49f8-9de4-0b2c20972028-6
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.530
there's some more of those
little cargo carts with the.

bc5767e9-ce84-488e-8226-e89fac9304d9-0
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.135
Luggage and the baggage and
there's a line of people on the

bc5767e9-ce84-488e-8226-e89fac9304d9-1
00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:48.060
left who are going towards a
little bus.

8e3a1be5-c637-4f8b-a719-044c0486234f-0
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.620
Um, and then there's looks like
there's some people.

33a4586c-8ae8-44aa-89e7-0830d83895d1-0
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.339
Maybe throwing something on each
other. There's some in some of

33a4586c-8ae8-44aa-89e7-0830d83895d1-1
00:19:57.339 --> 00:20:00.329
the uniforms there for people.
And then in the background

33a4586c-8ae8-44aa-89e7-0830d83895d1-2
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:03.473
there's another plane. Looks
like there's a couple elephants

33a4586c-8ae8-44aa-89e7-0830d83895d1-3
00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:06.566
that are boarding that plane.
That one's red and white. And

33a4586c-8ae8-44aa-89e7-0830d83895d1-4
00:20:06.566 --> 00:20:09.608
then on to the right of that
you'll see a couple different

33a4586c-8ae8-44aa-89e7-0830d83895d1-5
00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.670

{OK, again, that was about 3
minutes, so good with that. So

3054b352-7ef7-4c36-bbc6-de99392d18cc-1
00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:10.738
this next one is the longest one
that we have. It has 44 pages,

3054b352-7ef7-4c36-bbc6-de99392d18cc-2
00:25:10.738 --> 00:25:15.708
so you don't have to go into as
much detail just because it's

3054b352-7ef7-4c36-bbc6-de99392d18cc-3
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:16.749
really long.}

4437a0b9-8fe0-4145-ac38-e8fdfcaac366-0
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.340
{Yes.}

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-0
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.485
#START_wanderer OK, so this is a
2 pages and the one on the left

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-1
00:25:25.485 --> 00:25:29.154
has six different pictures and
the top left looks like there's

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-2
00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:32.706
a guy in a costume who has like
a horns on his head but it's

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-3
00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:35.909
otherwise it's a black and
silver striped costume. And

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-4
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:39.403
there's a guy next to him with
just T-shirt striped T-shirt

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-5
00:25:39.403 --> 00:25:43.014
pants and looks like they're
folding a massive piece of paper

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-6
00:25:43.014 --> 00:25:46.799
to the picture to the right. The
guy and the black is now in the

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-7
00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:50.352
center of the paper and the guy
in the striped shirt is also

c32d13e6-9a2c-4420-a596-6de1d9efbf81-8
00:25:50.352 --> 00:25:51.749
helping to fold a paper.

a4ce2863-3b24-4b47-9557-9812ec16b680-0
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.210
Down towards the guy in the
center.

786a8149-7bb2-4cbc-9fc1-58a4dfcb0cfc-0
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.538
Um. And then on the next row of
pictures, they're still folding

786a8149-7bb2-4cbc-9fc1-58a4dfcb0cfc-1
00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:00.849
the paper more towards the left.
It looks like there might be

786a8149-7bb2-4cbc-9fc1-58a4dfcb0cfc-2
00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:04.053
making like a like a hat of some
sort. And then in the next

786a8149-7bb2-4cbc-9fc1-58a4dfcb0cfc-3
00:26:04.053 --> 00:26:07.418
couple of pictures you see them
folding it now it almost looks

786a8149-7bb2-4cbc-9fc1-58a4dfcb0cfc-4
00:26:07.418 --> 00:26:08.700
like into a little boat.

d3165d4d-e813-475b-8187-44a748c09a01-0
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.577
And then on the right you see a
picture of a very large boat

d3165d4d-e813-475b-8187-44a748c09a01-1
00:26:13.577 --> 00:26:16.845
with a little like a round
circular part of it that goes

d3165d4d-e813-475b-8187-44a748c09a01-2
00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:18.050
underneath the water.

b3758f5a-77ad-438b-abe7-9cd27ace43be-0
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.012
Then you see the tiny, tiny
little like paper boat that

b3758f5a-77ad-438b-abe7-9cd27ace43be-1
00:26:22.012 --> 00:26:24.804
looks like that they made is on
the right part, right of that

b3758f5a-77ad-438b-abe7-9cd27ace43be-2
00:26:24.804 --> 00:26:25.120
screen.

babcec26-9025-4243-9f57-596785581844-0
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.171
And then you see the little boat
in the water in the bottom left

babcec26-9025-4243-9f57-596785581844-1
00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:34.147
and there's a couple of birds in
the sky, and then the far right,

babcec26-9025-4243-9f57-596785581844-2
00:26:34.147 --> 00:26:36.943
the it's a very large bird in
the top right, it's like in the

babcec26-9025-4243-9f57-596785581844-3
00:26:36.943 --> 00:26:37.439
foreground.

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-0
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.460
So you see the boats on the left
and the water, and there's a

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-1
00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.733
couple turtles that are getting
close to the boat and they have

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-2
00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:49.852
like a cross, like a, like a
checkerboard kind of pattern on

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-3
00:26:49.852 --> 00:26:53.125
their shelves. And the one looks
like it's blowing water out of

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-4
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:56.244
its nose towards the bottom or
air out of its nose. And then

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-5
00:26:56.244 --> 00:26:59.415
there's a bird also covers the
boat and a couple birds in the

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-6
00:26:59.415 --> 00:27:02.534
sky. And on the right side of
the screen you see the boats a

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-7
00:27:02.534 --> 00:27:05.551
lot smaller now because it's
next to this really big black

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-8
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:08.772
with some white spots. I don't
know if it's like a creature or

71b8c3ae-0a65-46e9-8d38-5678de0e3d69-9
00:27:08.772 --> 00:27:09.540
if it's a rock.

20e037c0-1f99-47a3-be35-c05750d6eb27-0
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.450
And then you see that boats at
the very top now of that.

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-0
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.995
Looks like it might actually be
the top fin of like a whale or

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-1
00:27:20.995 --> 00:27:23.937
something in the water and
underneath you. So now you see

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-2
00:27:23.937 --> 00:27:26.980
that's just a tiny little bit of
sky towards the top of the

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-3
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.669
screen and most of its
underwater in the picture. So

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-4
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:32.864
you see it looks like maybe like
a while and then there's some

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-5
00:27:32.864 --> 00:27:36.110
other large fish underneath and
some coral, some school fish as

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-6
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.204
well. So there's a lot of like
intricate detail of the coral

f3efa31f-c880-4980-a1cb-13c5d66e2bbf-7
00:27:39.204 --> 00:27:40.270
underneath the water.

427b9241-d202-42f5-a161-5cc96064a42e-0
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.179
so now it's still mostly
underwater picture you see the

427b9241-d202-42f5-a161-5cc96064a42e-1
00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:43.969
tiny boat towards the top left.
And then you see a bunch of

427b9241-d202-42f5-a161-5cc96064a42e-2
00:27:43.969 --> 00:27:45.788
coral, lots of different striped
fish. Um, there's some more

427b9241-d202-42f5-a161-5cc96064a42e-3
00:27:45.788 --> 00:27:47.160
tightly packed fish towards the
bottom right.

ea92349f-fd0f-48a5-918f-6c98e99e56f5-0
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.572
And then there's a lot of fish
towards the top, and they're all

ea92349f-fd0f-48a5-918f-6c98e99e56f5-1
00:27:51.572 --> 00:27:54.621
kind of like packed together in
a school. Almost looks like it's

ea92349f-fd0f-48a5-918f-6c98e99e56f5-2
00:27:54.621 --> 00:27:57.247
part of the coral, but it's
they're just tightly packed

ea92349f-fd0f-48a5-918f-6c98e99e56f5-3
00:27:57.247 --> 00:27:57.670
together.

b422e1f3-ce1c-49ef-adf7-fe35b916fd92-0
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.420
So another underwater picture,
and there's a couple more fish

b422e1f3-ce1c-49ef-adf7-fe35b916fd92-1
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.287
and two of them look like
they're kissing and there's

b422e1f3-ce1c-49ef-adf7-fe35b916fd92-2
00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:12.080
there's more coral and then
seahorses.

95578d58-7951-46a3-876b-eadefd0b758f-0
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.775
Or it looks like you kind of sea
horses and then towards on the

95578d58-7951-46a3-876b-eadefd0b758f-1
00:28:16.775 --> 00:28:20.041
right side, you see now there's
a fishing pole coming out of the

95578d58-7951-46a3-876b-eadefd0b758f-2
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:23.005
boat and it's going down.
There's a fish at the end of the

95578d58-7951-46a3-876b-eadefd0b758f-3
00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:26.070
line and the water and then
there's some more coral as well.

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-0
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.063
So on the left side, the boats
there and looks like there's

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-1
00:28:33.063 --> 00:28:35.945
like lines coming from
underneath it, but there's no

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-2
00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:39.317
fishing line that you can see.
And there's some fish that are

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-3
00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:42.689
not poking out of the water on
the left side. And then on the

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-4
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:45.898
right now you see there's a
long, whether it's like a rope

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-5
00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:49.161
or something that's coming out
of the water that's going up

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-6
00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:52.588
onto the boat, looks like it's
coming out of the sand and it's

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-7
00:28:52.588 --> 00:28:56.069
just kind of winding up and then
there's now a sea horse with a

63da0ad5-b1f7-4964-84d1-005a34cd4d09-8
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.320
little hat on the boat.

74cbf616-f57c-4f6f-b4f1-fb3903043463-0
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.988
So now you see the boat in the
water and there's like a flower

74cbf616-f57c-4f6f-b4f1-fb3903043463-1
00:29:04.988 --> 00:29:08.161
or something coming out of the
water and then straight ahead

74cbf616-f57c-4f6f-b4f1-fb3903043463-2
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:11.544
there's lots of like bushy trees
or shrubs and there's all kinds

74cbf616-f57c-4f6f-b4f1-fb3903043463-3
00:29:11.544 --> 00:29:14.770
of white Pelican type birds that
are coming out of the water.

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-0
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.636
And so now you see it's cross
section of it looks like it

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-1
00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:24.266
might be cross section of the
water. You see some of the

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-2
00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:27.035
flowers coming out of the water
and then towards the bottom

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-3
00:29:27.035 --> 00:29:29.803
there's fish and coral and then
you see these big tree like

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-4
00:29:29.803 --> 00:29:32.618
things that are coming out of
the water with the birds on it

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-5
00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:35.386
and then the the white boat is
now on the right side of the

35742e0b-8ca6-4adf-ad55-ade09aaff1fe-6
00:29:35.386 --> 00:29:35.709
screen.

6a4c102f-2bc2-4314-9eae-8ee8c8f7f365-0
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.787
So now you see the white boat
looks like it's going through

6a4c102f-2bc2-4314-9eae-8ee8c8f7f365-1
00:29:42.787 --> 00:29:45.847
this forest of all those shrubs.
There's some things on this in

6a4c102f-2bc2-4314-9eae-8ee8c8f7f365-2
00:29:45.847 --> 00:29:48.810
the side that looks like I have
three, couple of four or five

6a4c102f-2bc2-4314-9eae-8ee8c8f7f365-3
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.917
creatures that have two eyes and
they were kind of glowing down.

6a4c102f-2bc2-4314-9eae-8ee8c8f7f365-4
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:54.690
They're still a little seahorse
with the hat on the boat.

7a6850cd-e7cc-47f5-810d-50f0e1c91c8f-0
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.720
And then towards the top left
there's also lots of things.

7a6850cd-e7cc-47f5-810d-50f0e1c91c8f-1
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.389
Little creatures that are almost
look like eels, that have their

7a6850cd-e7cc-47f5-810d-50f0e1c91c8f-2
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:05.550
eyes looking down, and there's
some birds in the trees.

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-0
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.686
OK, so now you see it's a cross
section again, apart partly

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-1
00:30:13.686 --> 00:30:17.042
water, partly above water. And
there's the boat on the left

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-2
00:30:17.042 --> 00:30:20.455
with the seahorse still on the
boat with looking down out of

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-3
00:30:20.455 --> 00:30:23.475
the boat now and under the
water, you see it's like a

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-4
00:30:23.475 --> 00:30:26.832
almost like a lobster pipe
crustacean and there's something

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-5
00:30:26.832 --> 00:30:30.468
riding it and then there's more
fish and coral. And then towards

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-6
00:30:30.468 --> 00:30:33.936
the right you see the sea horses
jumping out of the water and

33060811-eebb-4745-9bcd-f5b490cf8881-7
00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:36.510
joining a couple other seahorse
in the water.

10931eab-4f14-470a-81ef-f61661317bf3-0
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.220
And the boat's now moving
towards the right.

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-0
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.554
When you see cross section of
the water, the top of it, it's

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-1
00:30:45.554 --> 00:30:48.884
mostly so most of it's the water
and then just a little top part

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-2
00:30:48.884 --> 00:30:52.111
of it is like above the water
there's another like a well type

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-3
00:30:52.111 --> 00:30:55.133
animal that's kind of popping
out of the water and there's

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-4
00:30:55.133 --> 00:30:58.155
some birds on the top of his
head and looks like it almost

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-5
00:30:58.155 --> 00:31:01.331
looks like it's like holding
like a cigar or something on the

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-6
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:04.251
left or something that's
sticking out of it. And then on

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-7
00:31:04.251 --> 00:31:07.631
the right side of the screen you
see more of that type of or it's

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-8
00:31:07.631 --> 00:31:10.551
a different type of creature,
looks like the boat is now

6de0f7de-a806-4f10-bacf-484f33161f20-9
00:31:10.551 --> 00:31:11.320
approaching it.

d4a1563a-0185-4530-bd6a-c7881cc12052-0
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.626
And there's something that's
like sticking out of its out of

d4a1563a-0185-4530-bd6a-c7881cc12052-1
00:31:14.626 --> 00:31:17.779
its head and then dangling
something and it looks like a TV

d4a1563a-0185-4530-bd6a-c7881cc12052-2
00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:21.091
or something and then under the
water you see that this little

d4a1563a-0185-4530-bd6a-c7881cc12052-3
00:31:21.091 --> 00:31:24.350
creature has like a curly tails
and some things on its back 2

d4a1563a-0185-4530-bd6a-c7881cc12052-4
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.398
two fight top legs and then
looks like 4 bottom legs, and

d4a1563a-0185-4530-bd6a-c7881cc12052-5
00:31:27.398 --> 00:31:30.710
the bottom legs are standing on
a bunch of like wrecked boats.

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-0
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.966
So now you see like a picture of
the horizon. There's like a

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-1
00:31:37.966 --> 00:31:41.350
snake on that background, like
the sun looks almost looks like

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-2
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.411
a fish in itself. And then in
the air there's a bunch of

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-3
00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:47.903
different types of birds you see
kind of like on that bottom far

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-4
00:31:47.903 --> 00:31:51.072
right, it's it's like a moon or
almost looks like earth or

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-5
00:31:51.072 --> 00:31:54.133
something. And up in the air and
then you see a bunch of

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-6
00:31:54.133 --> 00:31:57.356
creatures at the bottom who are
above the water, looks like

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-7
00:31:57.356 --> 00:32:00.794
there's a cat, there's the white
boat, and there's all kinds of

c8e054f0-7840-46e8-b976-2e723f786c17-8
00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:01.600
different like.

5db38be4-9476-41ca-9703-ea97e6a4e1a8-0
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.267
Computer type ones, there's ones
that are stripes, there's some

5db38be4-9476-41ca-9703-ea97e6a4e1a8-1
00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:06.784
that look like elephants that
are coming up and that's like a

5db38be4-9476-41ca-9703-ea97e6a4e1a8-2
00:32:06.784 --> 00:32:07.880
Jaguar looking one as well.

0963e5ad-066a-41b9-b0dd-5f398a493389-0
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.910
now it looks like it's at night.
You can see them Crescent Moon

0963e5ad-066a-41b9-b0dd-5f398a493389-1
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.210
like on the far right at the top
of the picture, cross section of

0963e5ad-066a-41b9-b0dd-5f398a493389-2
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.210
the water. There's just some
creatures and that little eyes

0963e5ad-066a-41b9-b0dd-5f398a493389-3
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.460
you can see underneath under the
water, the white boats. Just on

0963e5ad-066a-41b9-b0dd-5f398a493389-4
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.460
the left part of the screen
there's a bunch of stars in the

0963e5ad-066a-41b9-b0dd-5f398a493389-5
00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:27.660
sky.

365cd1cf-0077-43b8-8dbe-66b2dc65e3ea-0
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.768
So now there's a boat, and it
looks like it's surrounded by a

365cd1cf-0077-43b8-8dbe-66b2dc65e3ea-1
00:32:34.768 --> 00:32:37.470
bunch of little creatures around
it, like fish.

7b92966e-a1c6-47bd-b3a3-5fb70ce411c1-0
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.696
And then up now it's a picture
of mostly of the sky, looks like

7b92966e-a1c6-47bd-b3a3-5fb70ce411c1-1
00:32:43.696 --> 00:32:46.936
Aurora borealis or I'm not to
the right, we're going to say

7b92966e-a1c6-47bd-b3a3-5fb70ce411c1-2
00:32:46.936 --> 00:32:50.392
it, but the Northern Lights. So
there's like waves of different

7b92966e-a1c6-47bd-b3a3-5fb70ce411c1-3
00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:53.848
bright lights up in the sky and
you still see some stars around

7b92966e-a1c6-47bd-b3a3-5fb70ce411c1-4
00:32:53.848 --> 00:32:57.304
it. And there's the boat on the
water with the fish popping out

7b92966e-a1c6-47bd-b3a3-5fb70ce411c1-5
00:32:57.304 --> 00:32:57.790
of water.

9c7c748e-9681-43d3-85f5-ee8c2bbea90f-0
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.572
So it looks like there's a big
iceberg that is the boat little

9c7c748e-9681-43d3-85f5-ee8c2bbea90f-1
00:33:03.572 --> 00:33:04.240
boats going by.

596f31c1-6ef4-4780-bf95-8af2d4bcb3a3-0
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.525
And now the boat's going through
like a tunnel and you can see

596f31c1-6ef4-4780-bf95-8af2d4bcb3a3-1
00:33:10.525 --> 00:33:14.251
some like snow covered mountains
or so behind it and there's some

596f31c1-6ef4-4780-bf95-8af2d4bcb3a3-2
00:33:14.251 --> 00:33:17.750
maybe like ice chunks in the
water. And then on the right you

596f31c1-6ef4-4780-bf95-8af2d4bcb3a3-3
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.249
see it going through more of an
intricate tunnel cave system.

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-0
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.981
So on the left, um, you see
this, the boat is pretty small.

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-1
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:31.322
It's next to these really big
iceberg or Ice mountains next to

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-2
00:33:31.322 --> 00:33:34.239
it and looks like there's
something popping out of the

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-3
00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:37.527
water. It's like shining a light
on the boat. And then on the

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-4
00:33:37.527 --> 00:33:40.709
right side you see looks like
something has the boat now in

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-5
00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:43.732
its hand and it's this big
creature that came out of the

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-6
00:33:43.732 --> 00:33:47.019
water and it has like this big
old like scuba suit type thing

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-7
00:33:47.019 --> 00:33:50.095
on and a helmet with two eyes
that are looking and it has

6db9beb9-144b-4481-aba5-90a12251cf6e-8
00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:52.270
these tentacles that are shining
lights.

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-0
00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.319
So now you see that there's a
little bit of the boat in the

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-1
00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:02.209
bottom left, and this is above
water. You see one of those

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-2
00:34:02.209 --> 00:34:05.294
tentacles that are popping out
with light and it's now shining

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-3
00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:08.331
up against looks like one or two
really big boats, really big

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-4
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:11.515
ships. And there's one of those
ships is blowing out steam smoke

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-5
00:34:11.515 --> 00:34:14.601
off of its chimney stacks on the
left side of the picture. And

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-6
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:17.736
the one on the right looks like
it's carrying really big sacks,

5a70e42d-ffc1-44f2-85d2-87241a0dd0f9-7
00:34:17.736 --> 00:34:19.990
presumably like fishing, like a
fishing boat.

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-0
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.266
So then you see the boat on the
bottom left now is on the

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-1
00:34:27.266 --> 00:34:30.520
surface of the water, lots of
birds are in the sky, looks like

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-2
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.930
the birds are going down towards
the water. And then you see this

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-3
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:37.029
looks like an oil dock or one of
those oil rigs like in the

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-4
00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:40.181
middle of the water with the
stacks that are going down into

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-5
00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:43.125
the water. And it has a bunch of
some cranes and lots of

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-6
00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:46.380
smokestacks and it looks like
maybe all the pollutions pushing

2f5d1831-22c0-4cd5-8ec9-7a0fc15267b0-7
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.930
the birds down into the water.

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-0
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.352
So the little boat now is next
to this really big stack and you

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-1
00:34:56.352 --> 00:34:59.897
see people up in the windows of
this big structure that are

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-2
00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:03.266
looks like they're shooting
things down at the water and

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-3
00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:06.930
they have this like crane like
claw type thing not on a chain

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-4
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:10.712
that's coming down. And there's
some little like a scuba person

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-5
00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:13.962
coming out of the water and
looks like they're on this

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-6
00:35:13.962 --> 00:35:17.212
little rocket type thing and
there's not a little like

9ee2e414-bd65-4ce9-a07b-000f43d1f76b-7
00:35:17.212 --> 00:35:19.340
circular life raft on the life
boat

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-0
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.014
Then there's the person in like
the scuba gears. Now it's like a

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-1
00:35:27.014 --> 00:35:30.628
piece of rope. That's how. Held
on to that little white boat and

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-2
00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:33.852
the waves seem to be really
rocking now. And on the right

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-3
00:35:33.852 --> 00:35:37.300
you can see there's somebody in
that black from the beginning

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-4
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.469
with the horns and the black
costume with the stripes on

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-5
00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:43.972
looks like he's on top of this
oddly shaped boat, nursing lots

4de31b48-dd61-4e13-b54d-08d88a5d1f30-6
00:35:43.972 --> 00:35:47.030
of creatures on it with him. He
has a kite behind him.

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-0
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.358
So then there's a little white
boat and it's caught up in this

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-1
00:35:54.358 --> 00:35:57.414
really big like tsunami type
wave. And then closer in the

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-2
00:35:57.414 --> 00:36:00.628
foreground there's the guy in
the the black costume with the

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-3
00:36:00.628 --> 00:36:03.947
horns and the the kite now has
holes in it. And there's people

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-4
00:36:03.947 --> 00:36:07.266
who are like popping through it
and they still have a bunch of

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-5
00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:10.321
creatures and stuff and it's
still on its own little boat

2d681a19-f3d8-482d-8a1e-442d84ca6850-6
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:13.429
with the scuba guy seems to be
at the bottom boat now too.

130b1f87-e773-451f-aa03-b1d0802d0333-0
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:20.457
And then you see it looks like
Lightning storm on the left and

130b1f87-e773-451f-aa03-b1d0802d0333-1
00:36:20.457 --> 00:36:23.607
the boat and then on the right
side you see there is like a

130b1f87-e773-451f-aa03-b1d0802d0333-2
00:36:23.607 --> 00:36:26.600
piece of paper that's almost
like a paper airplane going

130b1f87-e773-451f-aa03-b1d0802d0333-3
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.440
through the air.

a897ddaa-b8b4-410d-9f5e-7848871dcd4a-0
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.563
So now you see the boat going
through. It's like an intricate

a897ddaa-b8b4-410d-9f5e-7848871dcd4a-1
00:36:34.563 --> 00:36:37.736
bunch of little arches in the
water, almost look like

a897ddaa-b8b4-410d-9f5e-7848871dcd4a-2
00:36:37.736 --> 00:36:41.379
tentacles or snakes, and on the
right side you see a piece of

a897ddaa-b8b4-410d-9f5e-7848871dcd4a-3
00:36:41.379 --> 00:36:44.670
paper like that paper airplane
towards the top of them.

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-0
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.552
So this is like a closer view of
all the little arches and it

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-1
00:36:52.552 --> 00:36:54.990
does look like it's like a
little snake struck snake

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-2
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.934
creature because you can see the
mouth and some glowing eyes on

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-3
00:36:57.934 --> 00:37:00.649
the left and then on the right
you can see the boats going

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-4
00:37:00.649 --> 00:37:03.455
through it and there's you can
see the the sky and the other

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-5
00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:06.215
side of it and there's some
creatures with eyes and the one

9fabce49-96c2-4a38-b3c7-86b726959886-6
00:37:06.215 --> 00:37:07.090
has a Big Horn too.

094c9c76-0f9c-423d-9adb-b34799de65c7-0
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.143
So then on the left side of the
screen you see those same

094c9c76-0f9c-423d-9adb-b34799de65c7-1
00:37:13.143 --> 00:37:16.038
creatures, one with the horns
and the glowing eyes. It's now

094c9c76-0f9c-423d-9adb-b34799de65c7-2
00:37:16.038 --> 00:37:18.887
popped out of the water pretty
high, and it looks like it's

094c9c76-0f9c-423d-9adb-b34799de65c7-3
00:37:18.887 --> 00:37:21.782
blowing water out of its nose
and it's onto the little white

094c9c76-0f9c-423d-9adb-b34799de65c7-4
00:37:21.782 --> 00:37:22.020
boat.

a4258a52-6720-4222-9569-f50e4035c77f-0
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.457
In the background in the sky,
you see a bunch of clouds and

a4258a52-6720-4222-9569-f50e4035c77f-1
00:37:26.457 --> 00:37:29.740
there's a piece of paper that
looks like in the water further

a4258a52-6720-4222-9569-f50e4035c77f-2
00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.652
away, and there's like a
creature with a swimsuit. And

a4258a52-6720-4222-9569-f50e4035c77f-3
00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:35.882
these weird fin wings on stand
to the right and they're sent

a4258a52-6720-4222-9569-f50e4035c77f-4
00:37:35.882 --> 00:37:38.160
bottles and stop sticking out of
the sand.

02fdc502-cefe-4704-a09b-c7d4f7f8831b-0
00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.207
Now it looks like you're looking
at a bunch of jellyfish, um,

02fdc502-cefe-4704-a09b-c7d4f7f8831b-1
00:37:45.207 --> 00:37:48.538
from underneath. And then there
is the little white boat that's

02fdc502-cefe-4704-a09b-c7d4f7f8831b-2
00:37:48.538 --> 00:37:50.100
now amongst all the jellyfish.

49dea457-fc7c-4934-9821-04e03fe855d4-0
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.326
And on the right there's a
really large one that has a

49dea457-fc7c-4934-9821-04e03fe855d4-1
00:37:53.326 --> 00:37:56.040
striped top and then really long
like tentacles going down.

443a500d-44db-4aae-84c2-84d6ac352a7b-0
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.089
Then you see the white boat
swimming with school of fish and

443a500d-44db-4aae-84c2-84d6ac352a7b-1
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:05.469
then towards the bottom right
looks like there's a couple of

443a500d-44db-4aae-84c2-84d6ac352a7b-2
00:38:05.469 --> 00:38:08.794
different type of shapes like
fish are urchins or something

443a500d-44db-4aae-84c2-84d6ac352a7b-3
00:38:08.794 --> 00:38:10.900
and the white boat is now down
there.

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-0
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.609
So the bottom left you see like
light shining down to this, onto

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-1
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:19.368
the onto the water. It looks
like there's a little creatures

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-2
00:38:19.368 --> 00:38:22.127
that are now like crawling onto
the boat, the boat. The boat

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-3
00:38:22.127 --> 00:38:24.931
looks a little wrinkled up and
it's on top of what looks like

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-4
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:27.644
to be an eel. And on the right
you see almost like a little

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-5
00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:30.358
submarine with a light shining
and it's like a checkerboard

bdbb3fd5-5cf4-4257-939a-e6e1f4d0e3be-6
00:38:30.358 --> 00:38:30.720
pattern.

c6427b17-5020-4225-b2d8-1a6c8ca75cfb-0
00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.786
And then you see the submarine
coming out of the water and

c6427b17-5020-4225-b2d8-1a6c8ca75cfb-1
00:38:36.786 --> 00:38:39.640
there will the white boats on
the top of it and there's water

c6427b17-5020-4225-b2d8-1a6c8ca75cfb-2
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.494
pouring off of it. There's a
school of fish at the bottom and

c6427b17-5020-4225-b2d8-1a6c8ca75cfb-3
00:38:42.494 --> 00:38:45.348
then on the right side you see
it's almost like a boat with a

c6427b17-5020-4225-b2d8-1a6c8ca75cfb-4
00:38:45.348 --> 00:38:48.248
propeller and there's all kinds
of tentacles attached that are

c6427b17-5020-4225-b2d8-1a6c8ca75cfb-5
00:38:48.248 --> 00:38:49.860
also so it's facing the
submarine.

a162ecae-4433-4cef-b767-ef9335aaff48-0
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.670
And there's a white boat now as
far to the right.

16f14a03-3e2f-43d6-9974-844fc8ae6742-0
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.561
Then you see the White Boat is
kind of being tossed up in the

16f14a03-3e2f-43d6-9974-844fc8ae6742-1
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:02.958
air with the by a bunch of seals
through half hour of water. And

16f14a03-3e2f-43d6-9974-844fc8ae6742-2
00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:06.095
then there's seals that are
under the water playing as well

16f14a03-3e2f-43d6-9974-844fc8ae6742-3
00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:09.231
or swimming around and then you
can see more like leaf like

16f14a03-3e2f-43d6-9974-844fc8ae6742-4
00:39:09.231 --> 00:39:11.949
coral structures under the water
on the right side.

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-0
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.814
So on the top is a cross section
of the water, again, the top

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-1
00:39:18.814 --> 00:39:22.233
left you see the boat and
underneath there's like leafy

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-2
00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:25.652
type coral, there's some big,
really big jellyfish type

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-3
00:39:25.652 --> 00:39:29.375
things, some striped fish. And
then on the right side of the

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-4
00:39:29.375 --> 00:39:33.160
boat and now looks like it's
almost angle to the right leg is

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-5
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.067
going to either go down in the
water maybe. And then underneath

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-6
00:39:37.067 --> 00:39:40.669
it is there's little scuba guy
down there and there's some

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-7
00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:44.515
shining light coming down from
one of the the the seashells or

10a46121-d960-4f39-a9de-29d09c34d676-8
00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:45.369
the creatures.

d9134e22-bf73-4221-9ef9-4b0c3581c9d1-0
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.690
Um.

6db5be53-8dee-459e-a037-f5e1e575d0a6-0
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.069
So now we're back above the
water and there's like a like

6db5be53-8dee-459e-a037-f5e1e575d0a6-1
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:57.089
one of those floating buoy
things with the light on it, and

6db5be53-8dee-459e-a037-f5e1e575d0a6-2
00:39:57.089 --> 00:40:00.260
there's some little creatures
crawling on it, and there's some

6db5be53-8dee-459e-a037-f5e1e575d0a6-3
00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.482
couple birds in the sky and the
boat is still left to the right

6db5be53-8dee-459e-a037-f5e1e575d0a6-4
00:40:03.482 --> 00:40:06.351
of it and the scuba guys now
riding one of those striped

6db5be53-8dee-459e-a037-f5e1e575d0a6-5
00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:07.660
creatures above the water.

84cd0307-eb33-4035-ad6e-fb8022eaa038-0
00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.261
And then on the right you can
see uh, lighthouse on some

84cd0307-eb33-4035-ad6e-fb8022eaa038-1
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:14.202
rocks. There's a person looks
like standing up next to the

84cd0307-eb33-4035-ad6e-fb8022eaa038-2
00:40:14.202 --> 00:40:17.492
lighthouse, a couple of ships in
the distance and the white boats

84cd0307-eb33-4035-ad6e-fb8022eaa038-3
00:40:17.492 --> 00:40:18.390
in the foreground.

6773ee54-4180-4db3-9028-7dd44b666b06-0
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.620
And so now it looks like it's a
um.

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-0
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.322
It's almost like a no like a dam
or like a lettuce or lattice

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-1
00:40:29.322 --> 00:40:32.486
structure. It's a circular
structure on the left and then

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-2
00:40:32.486 --> 00:40:35.978
it almost creates like this wall
through the water. Um, there's

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-3
00:40:35.978 --> 00:40:39.415
some ships on the right of it
and there's one ship on the left

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-4
00:40:39.415 --> 00:40:43.016
with some smokestacks as well in
the background. And then there's

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-5
00:40:43.016 --> 00:40:46.398
some more like sailboats and
like Clipper ships on the right.

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-6
00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:49.890
And you can see the tiny little
white boat is right in front of

2530d09c-8acd-496c-804e-bd51eafc8296-7
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.000
the circular part of that
structure that's in the water.

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-0
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.945
Um, and now you can see, uh, and
there's a really large boat that

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-1
00:40:58.945 --> 00:41:02.743
you've kind of seen of just the
edge of and then in front of it,

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-2
00:41:02.743 --> 00:41:06.482
there's smaller ship or smaller
boat in front of it and there's

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-3
00:41:06.482 --> 00:41:10.046
like a little sailboat like
attached to it. And then you can

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-4
00:41:10.046 --> 00:41:13.843
see the white boat is the little
small white paper boat is right

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-5
00:41:13.843 --> 00:41:17.407
at the edge of the large ship,
and there's a submarine under

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-6
00:41:17.407 --> 00:41:21.029
the water and there's a city
skyline in the background on the

226dacfc-159a-402f-9e85-f2b5a6f49386-7
00:41:21.029 --> 00:41:21.380
right.

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-0
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.219
So then on the left, Umm,
there's this big like whale type

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-1
00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:30.367
creature coming out and has like
a scuba gear and well, it has

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-2
00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:33.416
like a something that's coming
off of its back and then onto

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-3
00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:36.515
its head, almost looks like it's
pouring water on itself. And

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-4
00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:39.764
then there's the little floating
buoy thing with the light on at

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-5
00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:42.613
the bottom left. And then
there's some people on a small

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-6
00:41:42.613 --> 00:41:45.312
boat in front of it. To the
right of that you see two

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-7
00:41:45.312 --> 00:41:48.361
smaller ships and they're right
up against like a wall where

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-8
00:41:48.361 --> 00:41:51.410
there's a bunch of people at the
edge of the wall, like on a

8321b7ed-3668-46a3-903b-fdb595bead10-9
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.260
dock. And then behind them you
see the two really large.

15b5e7b0-365e-4dfd-b859-625a7d2d3aa0-0
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.510
Ships towards the behind them
towards the top of the picture

15b5e7b0-365e-4dfd-b859-625a7d2d3aa0-1
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.731
and then the little white boats
at the very bottom right corner

15b5e7b0-365e-4dfd-b859-625a7d2d3aa0-2
00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:01.940
at the edge of the wall.

052ac11b-9cf5-42c3-bfdc-48a9c63640ee-0
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.140
And then so on the left.

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-0
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.784
You see like a factory kind of
system in the background and

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-1
00:42:11.784 --> 00:42:15.166
there's water in the very bottom
of the page and you can see like

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-2
00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:18.446
the wall, the dock wall around
it. So in the background and the

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-3
00:42:18.446 --> 00:42:21.521
factory part, you can see like
some chimneys with smoke and

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-4
00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:24.391
some cranes, and they're
carrying different like things

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-5
00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:27.465
of cargo. And then then the
water, you can see a small boat

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-6
00:42:27.465 --> 00:42:30.796
with one man on it looks like he
has some clothes hanging on the

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-7
00:42:30.796 --> 00:42:33.974
one line. And there's a little
white boat. It's in the center

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-8
00:42:33.974 --> 00:42:36.997
of the page. And I mean the
bottom center. And then on the

4d20031b-29f2-4abc-beab-8bd0184b0fc8-9
00:42:36.997 --> 00:42:39.559
right side you can see like a
side of a building.

c91319cd-ce2f-452c-9455-30427fd473b5-0
00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.930
And there's this checkerboard
type pattern.

6b376394-5427-450b-8f38-70842628b443-0
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.337
I don't know if it is a boat or
creature or something as little

6b376394-5427-450b-8f38-70842628b443-1
00:42:48.337 --> 00:42:51.298
propellers on and the top is it
clear and you can see somebody

6b376394-5427-450b-8f38-70842628b443-2
00:42:51.298 --> 00:42:54.306
with a striped shirt in that top
part of it, and they have like

6b376394-5427-450b-8f38-70842628b443-3
00:42:54.306 --> 00:42:54.400
a.

a68f85f9-9131-4c62-ac7d-01cb1d53204d-0
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.190
I can't think of a word, but
like a steering wheel.

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-0
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.636
itAnd then on the left you see
the little white boat. It's

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-1
00:43:05.636 --> 00:43:08.951
still the whole background and
you can see like a city skyline,

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-2
00:43:08.951 --> 00:43:11.904
and they're still at the dock
edge. You can see the wall

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-3
00:43:11.904 --> 00:43:15.167
around the water there. And then
there's like the little white

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-4
00:43:15.167 --> 00:43:18.431
boats next to , a larger boat.
And then that bar that boat has

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-5
00:43:18.431 --> 00:43:21.695
like a dog, it's a person on it,
and there's some birds at the

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-6
00:43:21.695 --> 00:43:24.958
top of it and then looks like a
really big fishing net. It has

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-7
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:28.118
one of the underwater creatures
in it. And then on the right

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-8
00:43:28.118 --> 00:43:31.278
side, you see the little white
boats now up right up against

ba1a4c85-25c7-40a6-9b2f-bc998beaa2a1-9
00:43:31.278 --> 00:43:32.470
the stairs to the dock.

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-0
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.367
Now it's like towards the top of
a city skyline and you can just

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-1
00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:43.368
see a little bit of the water
kind of snaking through the city

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-2
00:43:43.368 --> 00:43:46.418
and you see some arches around
the Water River area through the

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-3
00:43:46.418 --> 00:43:49.467
picture, the little white boats
towards the bottom as the river

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-4
00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:52.517
kind of sneaks through the town
and you see mostly rooftops and

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-5
00:43:52.517 --> 00:43:55.376
there's looks like there's some
kind of creature, it's like

122c94e8-830a-4291-b28b-f4a92f443c78-6
00:43:55.376 --> 00:43:58.139
black and white striped and it
has these long wings with.

990b3f14-e344-4946-acd6-55fa63c60406-0
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.003
And treatment an intricate
propeller type on its back

990b3f14-e344-4946-acd6-55fa63c60406-1
00:44:03.003 --> 00:44:06.180
{attachment on its back just a
few more pages.}

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-0
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.540
So now you see Umm they're back
at like the water edge and the

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-1
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.270
wall looks like they're under
one of the archways. So they see

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-2
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.000
a little white boat right next
to the wall there and where the

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-3
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.493
archway is and there's a bunch
of intricate creatures like

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-4
00:44:23.493 --> 00:44:27.223
people with different patterns,
stripes, one that looks like a

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-5
00:44:27.223 --> 00:44:30.717
scuba suit, one has like a
almost like a like a wings type

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-6
00:44:30.717 --> 00:44:34.447
costume type thing on and the
one has like antlers like it's a

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-7
00:44:34.447 --> 00:44:38.118
like a deer towards the top of
its head. And then there's the

06929f6c-efcb-4e1f-aa94-34a7bc27c9a7-8
00:44:38.118 --> 00:44:39.479
guy with the black and.

1c3100d4-863b-47a7-aa96-c0624d65c504-0
00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.630
Um, white costume with the horn
on his head. He's riding a horse

1c3100d4-863b-47a7-aa96-c0624d65c504-1
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.320
now and he's going down the
stairs.

b4396b83-3247-4a65-8add-cefa064fc2f3-0
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.959
And then on the right side, um,
you see just a couple other

b4396b83-3247-4a65-8add-cefa064fc2f3-1
00:44:47.959 --> 00:44:50.662
people were at the top of the
stairs around one of the

b4396b83-3247-4a65-8add-cefa064fc2f3-2
00:44:50.662 --> 00:44:53.710
archways and there's some more
creatures in the water and the

b4396b83-3247-4a65-8add-cefa064fc2f3-3
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.480
white boats now going like
towards.

a5aed99d-0f9c-4974-9a67-703addead0b1-0
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:59.740
Further away and noticed the
river going through the arches.

bcba8edb-948d-4295-9139-99c906d209a7-0
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.215
So then you can see it's still
going under one of the arches

bcba8edb-948d-4295-9139-99c906d209a7-1
00:45:06.215 --> 00:45:09.064
and the bottom left. You see
some fish popping out. They're

bcba8edb-948d-4295-9139-99c906d209a7-2
00:45:09.064 --> 00:45:11.532
glowing eyes. You see a
submarine popped out of the

bcba8edb-948d-4295-9139-99c906d209a7-3
00:45:11.532 --> 00:45:14.475
water, a smaller boat docked on
the side of the bridge of the

bcba8edb-948d-4295-9139-99c906d209a7-4
00:45:14.475 --> 00:45:17.276
river next to the wall, and
there's some street lights you

bcba8edb-948d-4295-9139-99c906d209a7-5
00:45:17.276 --> 00:45:20.410
can see around the edges shining
down around the other buildings.

20641bce-0bae-45dc-a72a-e0b01179d792-0
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:23.880
{This is the last page.}

0d9944e3-c1e2-457c-80a0-bdedb5023bfd-0
00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.798
So then you see a little white
boat in the bottom left in the

0d9944e3-c1e2-457c-80a0-bdedb5023bfd-1
00:45:28.798 --> 00:45:32.170
water. You can see some trees
around it, and there's the wall.

2a601e31-c29d-4535-a662-8fbb09e8ad35-0
00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.772
Up in front of it and there's a
building right up at top of the

2a601e31-c29d-4535-a662-8fbb09e8ad35-1
00:45:35.772 --> 00:45:37.820
wall with a street light looking
down on it.

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-0
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.756
#END_wanderer And then the right
side, it says six picture um, 6

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-1
00:45:41.756 --> 00:45:44.840
frames. In the picture in the
top, you see the one boat next

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-2
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.822
to the wall. You can start to
see a little bit of a figure

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-3
00:45:47.822 --> 00:45:51.159
through the the top of the boat.
And then you can see, it's clear

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-4
00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:54.091
that there's like a figure
getting off the boat now going

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-5
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:56.973
up the stairs and you can see
it's it's like a black and

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-6
00:45:56.973 --> 00:46:00.108
white, mostly black with some
white design on the person. And

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-7
00:46:00.108 --> 00:46:03.242
then towards the top you see
there's some white feet and then

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-8
00:46:03.242 --> 00:46:06.528
you see the both the black feet
and the white feet standing next

1b9755a4-1a55-4d92-80c4-edfdebc4e67c-9
00:46:06.528 --> 00:46:08.450
to each other.{ OK, so that was
the.}

43c5a4fe-9b6f-4337-8380-88ec5595388d-0
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.320
{Story.

859b2479-8660-4ac3-9173-e4b25fa8270d-0
00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.190
Alright, so this next one again
is a complex scene.

1dda1ee5-2244-44c8-9299-4424bce533ba-0
00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.940
When you're ready, OK.}

60cec229-e965-427a-8d76-63b5d5341622-0
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.091
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
Ohh, dinosaur, spaceman and

60cec229-e965-427a-8d76-63b5d5341622-1
00:46:28.091 --> 00:46:31.922
ghouls. So it looks like on the
left side of the screen there's

60cec229-e965-427a-8d76-63b5d5341622-2
00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:35.514
like a bunch of like Cavemen
kind of figures and people and

60cec229-e965-427a-8d76-63b5d5341622-3
00:46:35.514 --> 00:46:39.165
then a bunch of some Dinos,
different dinosaurs, Triceratops

60cec229-e965-427a-8d76-63b5d5341622-4
00:46:39.165 --> 00:46:42.996
and there's a couple different
colors the dinosaurs and there's

60cec229-e965-427a-8d76-63b5d5341622-5
00:46:42.996 --> 00:46:46.050
some smaller green, more lizard
like looking ones.

0d257d0e-7b87-4ae3-8561-3b3cc921103a-0
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.013
And then at the Bottom left of
the screen, it looks like it's

0d257d0e-7b87-4ae3-8561-3b3cc921103a-1
00:46:52.013 --> 00:46:56.388
like a clothing store or like a
a maybe like a makeup counter or

0d257d0e-7b87-4ae3-8561-3b3cc921103a-2
00:46:56.388 --> 00:47:00.764
something. Because there's some
people I got a counter with like

0d257d0e-7b87-4ae3-8561-3b3cc921103a-3
00:47:00.764 --> 00:47:04.803
the Amir and some lights around
it. And then there's like a

0d257d0e-7b87-4ae3-8561-3b3cc921103a-4
00:47:04.803 --> 00:47:08.976
couple racks of clothing and
then there's some people who are

0d257d0e-7b87-4ae3-8561-3b3cc921103a-5
00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:11.400
dressed up as mummies next to
that.

4556c0a0-60b6-4e98-b807-91423b00ec82-0
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:19.996
And then next to that is like a
little like a stage setup and

4556c0a0-60b6-4e98-b807-91423b00ec82-1
00:47:19.996 --> 00:47:21.660
there's like.

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-0
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.992
Some dinosaurs or some mummy
shaped mummy people and then

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-1
00:47:25.992 --> 00:47:29.884
they're all kind of looking at
the this production type screen

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-2
00:47:29.884 --> 00:47:33.652
and there's some big flashing
big lights like stage crew has

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-3
00:47:33.652 --> 00:47:37.543
like lights in their hands as
well and it looks like it's like

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-4
00:47:37.543 --> 00:47:41.064
on the on the screen that
they're standing next to, it's

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-5
00:47:41.064 --> 00:47:44.647
like a blue dark blue sky.
There's some trees and they're

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-6
00:47:44.647 --> 00:47:48.353
like creepy looking type trees
and then there's like a Gray

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-7
00:47:48.353 --> 00:47:52.059
ground or mountain kind of
background and then there's like

50bd9607-4756-4a70-9e0c-e4569f7ef208-8
00:47:52.059 --> 00:47:52.429
these.

596cde98-4c37-4751-b3ba-7b8126a627f0-0
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.997
To being windows, um. And
there's actually looks like a

596cde98-4c37-4751-b3ba-7b8126a627f0-1
00:47:55.997 --> 00:47:59.994
soft serve cone like next to it,
right in the middle of it. And

596cde98-4c37-4751-b3ba-7b8126a627f0-2
00:47:59.994 --> 00:48:03.554
then there is some more on the
other right side of that.

596cde98-4c37-4751-b3ba-7b8126a627f0-3
00:48:03.554 --> 00:48:07.363
There's like a video camera and
there's some more of the big

596cde98-4c37-4751-b3ba-7b8126a627f0-4
00:48:07.363 --> 00:48:08.800
production type lights.

82ed7b44-4ae9-4ca6-bf89-f83cbb8eab48-0
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.155
And then on the right side of
that, on the bottom right side

82ed7b44-4ae9-4ca6-bf89-f83cbb8eab48-1
00:48:14.155 --> 00:48:14.990
of the screen.

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-0
00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.513
Looks like it's like a cafeteria
of some sort. There's pictures

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-1
00:48:19.513 --> 00:48:22.703
of pie on the wall. Um, there's
a bunch of tables with people

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-2
00:48:22.703 --> 00:48:25.636
sitting and eating. There's a
cafeteria line with like a

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-3
00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:28.621
buffet counter, and there's
people behind it, and there's

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-4
00:48:28.621 --> 00:48:31.503
people in the front getting
food. The one person on the

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-5
00:48:31.503 --> 00:48:34.745
right looks like they dropped
their train. There's food flying

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-6
00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:38.038
everywhere, and there's a window
that looks outside of the room

525de363-4657-4807-8cf6-8c816271f84a-7
00:48:38.038 --> 00:48:38.450
as well.

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-0
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:43.446
So then behind that there's like
a larger big production screen

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-1
00:48:43.446 --> 00:48:47.272
on the top right and you can see
a bunch of like like stage crew

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-2
00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:50.921
people at the top of it. And
there's like some long wires and

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-3
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:54.629
cables and there's big fights at
the top right. There's almost

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-4
00:48:54.629 --> 00:48:58.396
like a ladder structure holding
up the very tall screen. And on

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-5
00:48:58.396 --> 00:49:01.868
that screen it's more of like a
space, like an outer space

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-6
00:49:01.868 --> 00:49:05.400
theme. There's a couple of
different like saucers with like

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-7
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.931
these green alien type figures
in them. Over on top of them

c7483a8d-8dd1-4411-bf43-d0dedde53976-8
00:49:08.931 --> 00:49:10.049
there's a bunch of.

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-0
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.378
Like astronaut figures, they're
dressed in orange and yellow who

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-1
00:49:14.378 --> 00:49:17.738
are like floating around.
They're being hung by the

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-2
00:49:17.738 --> 00:49:21.613
strings from the top of the
stage production setup and then

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-3
00:49:21.613 --> 00:49:25.296
looks like there's like a
spaceship. That's also I think

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-4
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:29.236
we have some people in it as
well. You can see like a like a

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-5
00:49:29.236 --> 00:49:32.983
directors chair when it's like
and it's up on like on the

d6d38678-630a-4a73-b6fd-655d079f04e5-6
00:49:32.983 --> 00:49:36.729
ladder. And then there's the
grand camera in their hands.

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-0
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.337
#END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
And then you can see a couple

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-1
00:49:41.337 --> 00:49:44.393
other cameras on the left side
of that whole stage area as

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-2
00:49:44.393 --> 00:49:47.553
well, and then on the far left.
And like I said, there's the

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-3
00:49:47.553 --> 00:49:50.506
dinosaurs and there's the
caveman type people at the top

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-4
00:49:50.506 --> 00:49:53.873
of the one part of the hills on
this like a volcano. And there's

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-5
00:49:53.873 --> 00:49:56.825
some people who are sitting on
the different spots where

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-6
00:49:56.825 --> 00:49:59.778
there's like lava coming out,
then you can see them like

8eb13bbb-4962-4e0c-b2b3-877de2d0880b-7
00:49:59.778 --> 00:50:00.969
bouncing up in the air.

f519fd97-2f93-4538-9c44-9e972680569c-0
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.830
{Um, yeah, that's about it.}

e8c7ba6b-7a17-4b4a-b5b2-036f3db1714d-0
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:11.674
{Alright, good. That was about
four minutes. So going forward

e8c7ba6b-7a17-4b4a-b5b2-036f3db1714d-1
00:50:11.674 --> 00:50:13.850
to the next complex scene.}

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-0
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.353
#START_exhibit-12 OK, so this
one looks like it's a couple

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-1
00:50:19.353 --> 00:50:22.604
different levels. So it looks
like there's a a ground level,

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-2
00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:25.961
there's some stairs, there's a
second level, a bunch of people

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-3
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:29.105
on all three levels, and then
there's a third level on the

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-4
00:50:29.105 --> 00:50:32.408
walls. It's red walls. There's
lots of pictures on the walls.

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-5
00:50:32.408 --> 00:50:35.765
And then so lots of people on
the bottom on the first level of

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-6
00:50:35.765 --> 00:50:39.069
this, like a cross section of a
building. So you can see like

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-7
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:42.426
the inside. So the first level
you can see there's some people

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-8
00:50:42.426 --> 00:50:45.836
who are painting, Umm, there's a
big horse painting down at the

bd0fd114-0221-4fef-bd15-dd2e36e73b0a-9
00:50:45.836 --> 00:50:46.210
bottom.

55f1616b-d2b6-4bd8-8e67-7b46ac5510bb-0
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.030
There's people who are painting
or like putting.

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-0
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.256
Like a like a poster up on the
wall in the bottom left. You can

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-1
00:50:55.256 --> 00:50:59.065
also see there's people who are
painting more of like almost

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-2
00:50:59.065 --> 00:51:02.750
looks like a on a canvas type
thing and looks like they're

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-3
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.559
wearing like a headdress, a
feather headdress as well. There

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-4
00:51:06.559 --> 00:51:10.368
is somebody else who's sitting
has like a pallet who's doing

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-5
00:51:10.368 --> 00:51:13.678
almost like a caricature.
There's a couple different

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-6
00:51:13.678 --> 00:51:17.487
people who are sitting at their
with their easels as well on

920bd3b4-ec1a-42a4-b2d6-022668408611-7
00:51:17.487 --> 00:51:20.860
that bottom center area and then
on the bottom right.

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-0

00:51:24.865 --> 00:51:28.391
It's like a canvas, like came
out down over their head, like

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-2
00:51:28.391 --> 00:51:32.033
around their waist, and there's
like a picture of a king also.

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-3
00:51:32.033 --> 00:51:35.559
And then there's lots and lots
of people who are all crowded

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-4
00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:39.027
together towards that center
middle. And there's people who

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-5
00:51:39.027 --> 00:51:42.610

or putting them on the wall on

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-6
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.905
the right. There's people
climbing up a ladder to get to

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-7
00:51:45.905 --> 00:51:49.431
them. And you see in the bottom
right there's pictures on of

0c54b62b-26bd-49cc-b906-73c4ac88f026-8

So then there's people going up
and down the stairs. There's

4ed30b53-b0ff-47ab-b19a-0cb5ea134035-1
00:51:55.596 --> 00:51:58.961
people carrying photos. Whether
they're going up and down, it's

00:51:58.961 --> 00:52:02.168
hard to tell, but they're all
going in different directions.

4ed30b53-b0ff-47ab-b19a-0cb5ea134035-3
00:52:02.168 --> 00:52:05.060
They're holding different
pictures. And on that second

4ed30b53-b0ff-47ab-b19a-0cb5ea134035-4

exhibit wall. There's people who
are hanging from the ceiling,

4ed30b53-b0ff-47ab-b19a-0cb5ea134035-8
00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:21.199

00:52:24.762 --> 00:52:27.994
well. And then there's another
ladder to the right of that

c244d04c-deb1-4379-85a3-c30ae3c24cc9-2
00:52:27.994 --> 00:52:31.501
where they're also painting on
that wall. And then you see lots

c244d04c-deb1-4379-85a3-c30ae3c24cc9-3
00:52:31.501 --> 00:52:34.625

e673b8ec-fecd-4158-9863-c704098b138e-0
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:04.084
{Alright, so just about 3
minutes we can go ahead. That

e673b8ec-fecd-4158-9863-c704098b138e-1
00:53:04.084 --> 00:53:09.371
one was the busy, the most
crowded one. I think this one is

e673b8ec-fecd-4158-9863-c704098b138e-2
00:53:09.371 --> 00:53:10.869
a little better.}

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-0

00:53:15.872 --> 00:53:18.941
a cityscape. Umm, you can or
like a like a town square and

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-2
00:53:18.941 --> 00:53:22.270
just there's a little triangle
in the center with the fountain.

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-3
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.235
And then there's people walking
around. There's a couple

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-4
00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:28.199
different cars and different
directions. And then in the

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-5
00:53:28.199 --> 00:53:31.320
bottom part of the you see
almost like a little like a park

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-6
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.441
area. There's like a fairground.
There's a couple different

98a429c6-76f9-4110-b1c4-cad36f7a181e-7
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:37.509
buildings that have striped
awnings, like maybe like it's.

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-0
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:41.759
Like a market, Fresh Market or
something. So the one looks like

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-1
00:53:41.759 --> 00:53:45.076

00:53:45.076 --> 00:53:48.393
like a bouquet of flowers. And
then the next one looks like it

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-3
00:53:48.393 --> 00:53:51.604
might be fabric as these two
people who have a piece of like

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-4
00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:55.079
blue and white striped fabric in
between their hands. And then to

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-5
00:53:55.079 --> 00:53:58.343

little booth and you can see

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-6
00:53:58.343 --> 00:54:01.554
just the roof. The awnings of
the couple other booths in the

d57f4fbc-044c-4b56-a3ae-ef8861ebf934-7
00:54:01.554 --> 00:54:04.661

there's some kids you can see.
It looks like they got wrapped

cbe415c8-775a-4b30-b3b7-8f5360e10eca-2
00:54:13.547 --> 00:54:16.091
up in some of the plants at the
1 booth towards the bottom

cbe415c8-775a-4b30-b3b7-8f5360e10eca-3
00:54:16.091 --> 00:54:16.350

people on ladders up against the

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.325
people. Some of them are seated
at a table, the one on the

e45c175b-4bd4-47ca-bb50-92bc3e278a93-5
00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:48.757

and it looks like they have a
bucket and rags. And then

4966ed95-2369-43a4-877c-d3461a8c85ff-2

75ed8538-71b4-4485-8c07-2dfc1a28fe42-5
00:56:13.713 --> 00:56:17.044
behind, above that towards the
top of the screen, it looks like

75ed8538-71b4-4485-8c07-2dfc1a28fe42-6
00:56:17.044 --> 00:56:20.115
there's like a gas station or a
garage. There's mechanics,

75ed8538-71b4-4485-8c07-2dfc1a28fe42-7
00:56:20.115 --> 00:56:23.342
somebody working on one of their
cars and then there's a shoe

75ed8538-71b4-4485-8c07-2dfc1a28fe42-8
00:56:23.342 --> 00:56:26.465

standing outside.

1d0cbb0e-58dd-40d7-9da9-96c4fddb9727-0
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:30.645
Looking at the TV through the
window and then it looks like a

1d0cbb0e-58dd-40d7-9da9-96c4fddb9727-1
00:56:30.645 --> 00:56:33.840
fire station. You can see the
fire truck with some firemen or

1d0cbb0e-58dd-40d7-9da9-96c4fddb9727-2
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.087
firefighters around it and then
maybe like a police station to

1d0cbb0e-58dd-40d7-9da9-96c4fddb9727-3
00:56:37.087 --> 00:56:40.076
the right of that because you
can see some people in blue

1d0cbb0e-58dd-40d7-9da9-96c4fddb9727-4
00:56:40.076 --> 00:56:42.860

cb4bfe18-1523-4869-ada1-151fadeb5df1-0
00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.572
And then at the very top of the
screen, you can just see a

cb4bfe18-1523-4869-ada1-151fadeb5df1-1
00:56:46.572 --> 00:56:48.914
little bit of the buildings
behind it and there's like

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.991
Maybe like an ambulance because
it looked over like a hospital.

53490904-ee0f-4320-b502-ef059fe19bb8-1
00:56:54.991 --> 00:56:57.816

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.762
people who look like they fell
off their bicycles. And you see

53490904-ee0f-4320-b502-ef059fe19bb8-4
00:57:03.762 --> 00:57:06.587

00:57:06.587 --> 00:57:09.610
street and there it looks like a
presumably a school because

53490904-ee0f-4320-b502-ef059fe19bb8-6
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:12.484

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.219
And then on the left side of the
screen you can see part of the

84910dbc-8fdd-4287-86f9-e5beed70858c-1
00:57:21.219 --> 00:57:24.402
building looks like there's
another fire truck on the center

84910dbc-8fdd-4287-86f9-e5beed70858c-2
00:57:24.402 --> 00:57:27.272

can see hoses going through some
of the windows and across the

84910dbc-8fdd-4287-86f9-e5beed70858c-4
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.795
roof. And then to the right of
that it's like a pink building

84910dbc-8fdd-4287-86f9-e5beed70858c-5

058c353c-29b2-4fff-b9b3-5e36f4c127fc-1
01:01:13.454 --> 01:01:13.690
Hmm.

bbae0a5f-9081-4b1d-9256-b8a439f7a0ac-0
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.358
Umm, little bit to the right of
that. There's a picture of

bbae0a5f-9081-4b1d-9256-b8a439f7a0ac-1
01:01:18.358 --> 01:01:21.847
somebody who's like hungover
some ropes like you would see

bbae0a5f-9081-4b1d-9256-b8a439f7a0ac-2
01:01:21.847 --> 01:01:23.740
around like a boxing ring. Yeah.

048ea11b-ccca-42ad-91ff-b213fd4f1fee-0
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.517
And see a little bit more to the
right, you see somebody like the

048ea11b-ccca-42ad-91ff-b213fd4f1fee-1
01:01:29.517 --> 01:01:32.929
person from the last picture who
was sitting on top of the

048ea11b-ccca-42ad-91ff-b213fd4f1fee-2
01:01:32.929 --> 01:01:36.573
fountain. There's a picture of
somebody like in a go Kart or a

048ea11b-ccca-42ad-91ff-b213fd4f1fee-3
01:01:36.573 --> 01:01:37.210
bumper car.

0cea744f-67ba-461b-9ee9-d1946d46d8d2-0
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.620
In the far right. There's a
picture of a dog who's on a

0cea744f-67ba-461b-9ee9-d1946d46d8d2-1
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.965
leash. There's a picture of a
tree who has like a a face with

0cea744f-67ba-461b-9ee9-d1946d46d8d2-2
01:01:46.965 --> 01:01:48.260
his tongue sticking out.

09b37c28-b9ee-4cc0-9ad8-92977f74a6e4-0
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.192
Right above that is a picture of
a plane which has like wings

09b37c28-b9ee-4cc0-9ad8-92977f74a6e4-1
01:01:52.192 --> 01:01:53.110
like a bird though.

d81ffd38-f341-4808-bae0-5503d2320262-0
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.234
To the left of that, Umm,
there's a picture of somebody

d81ffd38-f341-4808-bae0-5503d2320262-1
01:01:58.234 --> 01:02:01.126
looks like they are juggling or
or slipped on the balls or

d81ffd38-f341-4808-bae0-5503d2320262-2
01:02:01.126 --> 01:02:04.164
something, and then they have a
bag in their hands that looks

d81ffd38-f341-4808-bae0-5503d2320262-3
01:02:04.164 --> 01:02:06.811
like it also has some other
things falling out of it.

d81ffd38-f341-4808-bae0-5503d2320262-4
01:02:06.811 --> 01:02:09.359
There's a picture of a somebody
with a backpack on.

27b0e347-bd6a-4969-8033-93e81d22f374-0
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.146
there's a picture of somebody
who looks like their head is

27b0e347-bd6a-4969-8033-93e81d22f374-1
01:02:14.146 --> 01:02:17.754
inside of a house and their head
lifts up the roof of the house

27b0e347-bd6a-4969-8033-93e81d22f374-2
01:02:17.754 --> 01:02:21.249
and using the chimney. So you
just see their eyes between the

27b0e347-bd6a-4969-8033-93e81d22f374-3
01:02:21.249 --> 01:02:24.745
roof and then the main part of
the house looks like there's a

27b0e347-bd6a-4969-8033-93e81d22f374-4
01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:28.296
picture of somebody who is was
skiing and it's like wrapped up

27b0e347-bd6a-4969-8033-93e81d22f374-5
01:02:28.296 --> 01:02:30.269
in a snowball to the left of
that.

d1f1f742-e36c-4372-9892-969813d5a057-0
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.140
And then the far left, there's
another picture of like a Red

d1f1f742-e36c-4372-9892-969813d5a057-1
01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.756
Dragon picture of somebody who's
standing or surfing on top of

d1f1f742-e36c-4372-9892-969813d5a057-2
01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:39.560
somebody else.

53151fd3-10df-41db-be38-2d32bca90e58-0
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.273
#END_picture_this Here's a
picture of a guy who looks like

53151fd3-10df-41db-be38-2d32bca90e58-1
01:02:43.273 --> 01:02:45.589
he's in a wheelbarrow talking to
somebody else and he's being

53151fd3-10df-41db-be38-2d32bca90e58-2
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:46.710
dragged by in the wheelbarrow.

e2e9e464-d9ac-4df3-8a7d-8bda2efe2595-0
01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:50.650
{OK, that was about 5 minutes.
That's nice.

12e2754f-d8b3-4973-bb4b-6bf44d93c9b7-0
01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.090
Right.

3dc4afd7-e68f-4019-91b2-9ab5521e3017-0
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:57.044
OK, so we just have a few more
and this one is a graphic novel

3dc4afd7-e68f-4019-91b2-9ab5521e3017-1
01:02:57.044 --> 01:02:58.550
that has around 5 pages.}

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-0
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.516
#START_arrival_1 So this is a
spread of nine pictures. On the

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-1
01:03:04.516 --> 01:03:08.055
top left, you see a man, a woman
and a child in the picture. Now

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-2
01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:11.323
somebody holding that picture.
And then you see somebody is

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-3
01:03:11.323 --> 01:03:14.536
wrapping that picture up. And
then they wrap it up in like

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-4
01:03:14.536 --> 01:03:17.857
some cloth or wrap paper and
then put a ribbon around it and

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-5
01:03:17.857 --> 01:03:21.125
put a bow on it and then looks
like they're putting it away

b2e089d3-b4e9-4e9c-bf7b-da538e297be3-6
01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:22.650
into a trunk or a briefcase.

95a528a9-b10d-4c6e-ae98-06cf9f7151c2-0
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:30.701
So then there's a spread of nine
pictures on the left. There's a

95a528a9-b10d-4c6e-ae98-06cf9f7151c2-1
01:03:30.701 --> 01:03:34.764
paper origami on like a paper
crane alarm clock. There's a hat

95a528a9-b10d-4c6e-ae98-06cf9f7151c2-2
01:03:34.764 --> 01:03:38.762
in something, a piece of cloth
hanging on the wall. There's a

95a528a9-b10d-4c6e-ae98-06cf9f7151c2-3
01:03:38.762 --> 01:03:42.954
pot in the cooking spoon. There
is a like a child's drawing of a

95a528a9-b10d-4c6e-ae98-06cf9f7151c2-4
01:03:42.954 --> 01:03:47.017
man in a hat, a woman and child
with a little bird and the son

95a528a9-b10d-4c6e-ae98-06cf9f7151c2-5
01:03:47.017 --> 01:03:50.500
in the background. There is a
teapot that's steaming.

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-0
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.040
And then there is a picture of
some, some papers or some mail

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-1
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.881
with a teacup, teacup on the
saucer. And then there's an open

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-2
01:03:58.881 --> 01:04:02.722
trunk with some folded things in
it. And the closer up of the

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-3
01:04:02.722 --> 01:04:06.624
picture of the man, the woman
and the child on the right side,

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-4
01:04:06.624 --> 01:04:10.031
you see some of all those
figures, all those things in

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-5
01:04:10.031 --> 01:04:13.934
different. It's a picture of a
man and a woman with a trunk on

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-6
01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:17.899
a dining room table. But you see
all those small parts from the

f0ee594e-9195-4b09-bb78-1c875130c658-7
01:04:17.899 --> 01:04:21.739
left part of the picture on the
right, so you see on the top.

1339ea78-3932-4c5c-b1a6-fa57a2d978be-0
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:25.424
The the clock, the paper crane.
You see the hat and the wall,

1339ea78-3932-4c5c-b1a6-fa57a2d978be-1
01:04:25.424 --> 01:04:28.690
the teapot and the teacups and
everything on the table.

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-0
01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.362
And then there is a spread on
the left. There's the girl who

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-1
01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:39.001
looks like she's waking up out
of bed. She's rubbing her eyes.

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-2
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:42.697
She goes, she sitting on a table
and she's eating something out

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-3
01:04:42.697 --> 01:04:46.278
of a bowl of spoon. She looks
over to the left and she sees a

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-4
01:04:46.278 --> 01:04:49.570
trunk or a briefcase. Then
there's a man who's putting a

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-5
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:53.150
hat on a woman who's putting
like a wrap around her hair, and

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-6
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:56.673
then looks like they're getting
the kid ready as well. Looks

c415360b-5379-4ca6-add6-a32df8d99972-7
01:04:56.673 --> 01:05:00.370
like they have a coat on a child
and helping them button it up.

aa0e4ffd-7311-4bfa-a175-96b2b29822fc-0
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.751
Some somebody's putting boots
on, and then the kid looks like

aa0e4ffd-7311-4bfa-a175-96b2b29822fc-1
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:06.864
she's bundled up and she's
holding the briefcase, and then

aa0e4ffd-7311-4bfa-a175-96b2b29822fc-2
01:05:06.864 --> 01:05:10.188
then the end is reaching down
for something. He's out with his

aa0e4ffd-7311-4bfa-a175-96b2b29822fc-3
01:05:10.188 --> 01:05:13.512
jacket and his hat on, and then
you see three of them leaving,

aa0e4ffd-7311-4bfa-a175-96b2b29822fc-4
01:05:13.512 --> 01:05:16.519
walking down a sidewalk, and
he's holding the briefcase.

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-0
01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.745
So then you see the girls
holding on to some one of the

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-1
01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:27.192
their adults hands. She looks
up, she looking around and you

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-2
01:05:27.192 --> 01:05:30.923
can see there now next to like a
train tracks and there's a bunch

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-3
01:05:30.923 --> 01:05:33.862
of people and they have their
luggage. You see like

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-4
01:05:33.862 --> 01:05:37.423
smokestacks in the background of
the picture. And then you see

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-5
01:05:37.423 --> 01:05:40.927
the somebody puts their hand,
looks like the the dad puts the

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-6
01:05:40.927 --> 01:05:44.205
hand on the girl's shoulder and
he pops up in his hat and

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-7
01:05:44.205 --> 01:05:47.427
there's a little paper crane
under his hat on top of his

6539207f-60cc-4a6a-b4a0-a7f925762552-8
01:05:47.427 --> 01:05:47.710
head.

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-0
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:51.233
Um, he gives that to her. So on
the right side of the screen

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-1
01:05:51.233 --> 01:05:54.226
now, you see she's holding it.
And then he gives her a hug.

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-2
01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:57.219
She's still holding it. She's
looking, looking over at him.

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-3
01:05:57.219 --> 01:06:00.313
The woman. And the adult woman
is now like crying. She's like

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-4
01:06:00.313 --> 01:06:03.007
dabbing her face with
handkerchief. She's hugging the

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-5
01:06:03.007 --> 01:06:06.050
man. He's holding her head and
he's saying something to her.

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-6
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.943
And then looks like he's getting
on the train. He has the

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-7
01:06:08.943 --> 01:06:12.036
briefcase with him and he holds
on to their hands and you see

913e888c-b168-4098-ae3f-6b34a38799fc-8
01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:15.180
their hands letting go, and then
you see the train going away.

4f07c2d6-928a-4f85-a460-186aaa996bf3-0
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:21.650
Then it goes back to the picture
of the three of them sitting,

4f07c2d6-928a-4f85-a460-186aaa996bf3-1
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:25.098
and then you see a little bit
further away. It's on, it's on

4f07c2d6-928a-4f85-a460-186aaa996bf3-2
01:06:25.098 --> 01:06:28.772

a spoon in it. And then you see
the guy who's the one who has

4f07c2d6-928a-4f85-a460-186aaa996bf3-4
01:06:32.277 --> 01:06:35.838

briefcase or something next to
him. And then you see him

4f07c2d6-928a-4f85-a460-186aaa996bf3-6
01:06:39.059 --> 01:06:42.338
through a small like little
circular window. And then you

4f07c2d6-928a-4f85-a460-186aaa996bf3-7
01:06:42.338 --> 01:06:45.673

01:06:49.574 --> 01:06:51.450
and then you see the ship on the
water itself.

83f9c3f9-a241-4a8c-b3fe-5260b428332a-0
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.120
{Alright, that was good. OK, so

trees, there's a fence around
the perimeter and there's a lot

869a73f6-ab2e-42a1-9334-fccc998c3dda-3

people inside and there's kids
jumping up and down. These kids

Bunny costume 1 looks like maybe

somebody chasing them with a big
net in their hand behind them.

8e0742ba-f785-474a-8028-52a91564e505-0
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.191
And then behind the the Little
Castle type thing, there's you

8e0742ba-f785-474a-8028-52a91564e505-1

fence line and there's like
streamers and things hanging

8e0742ba-f785-474a-8028-52a91564e505-3
01:07:51.099 --> 01:07:54.731
from the trees. There's some
people in scarier costumes like

8e0742ba-f785-474a-8028-52a91564e505-4
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:58.304
skeleton faces or ghost faces.
And then underneath the tree

8e0742ba-f785-474a-8028-52a91564e505-5
01:07:58.304 --> 01:08:01.937

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:11.622
So then on the center of the
page you see there's some like a

797e6386-7634-4662-b18e-caad06cf1e7c-1
01:08:11.622 --> 01:08:15.604
more trees and bushes and

01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.061
Looks like the one kid who
popped out of the flowers is

be7e3741-1229-4fb8-a539-82c86da16a24-1
01:08:35.061 --> 01:08:38.337

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:41.560
the angle costume. And then you
see like a little kiddie pool

be7e3741-1229-4fb8-a539-82c86da16a24-3
01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.888
and there's somebody dressed up
as a mermaid who just got water

be7e3741-1229-4fb8-a539-82c86da16a24-4
01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:48.008
dumped on their head. There's
somebody who's falling out of

01:08:48.008 --> 01:08:50.920
the kiddie pool and splashing
water all over the place.

48e5ba31-b4b2-4911-8d97-db95103753d1-0
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:55.938
And then there's somebody with a
water gun who was spraying water

48e5ba31-b4b2-4911-8d97-db95103753d1-1
01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:59.141
at somebody walking by the
kiddie pool. The bottom right

48e5ba31-b4b2-4911-8d97-db95103753d1-2
01:08:59.141 --> 01:09:02.849
You see there's somebody dressed
up as like a sheep and shepherd.

1a6b882d-61fa-4249-898c-5d2b19e5a920-0
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:07.439
And there's some people dressed
up as like witches or Wizards.

1a6b882d-61fa-4249-898c-5d2b19e5a920-1
01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.505
And up underneath that,
underneath the kiddie pool, and

1a6b882d-61fa-4249-898c-5d2b19e5a920-2
01:09:10.505 --> 01:09:13.681
then to the left of that, you
see people walking into the

1a6b882d-61fa-4249-898c-5d2b19e5a920-3
01:09:13.681 --> 01:09:16.966

01:09:20.525 --> 01:09:23.920
a clown holding balloons right
above that. And then there's a

1a6b882d-61fa-4249-898c-5d2b19e5a920-6
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.205
table of food towards the top
left, lots of food and plates

1a6b882d-61fa-4249-898c-5d2b19e5a920-7

war right next to that table.

99ef7754-4414-45fd-9fd6-fe1ba24c268a-0
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:36.606
And there's a pinatas in the

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:38.860
a little lady peeking over the
fence line.

0c39e0eb-de25-45b4-8674-21e32f4b3153-0
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.779
#END_birthday_party_fun And then
there's somebody carrying a cake

0c39e0eb-de25-45b4-8674-21e32f4b3153-1
01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.103
towards the top center who's
bringing it towards the table

0c39e0eb-de25-45b4-8674-21e32f4b3153-2
01:09:45.103 --> 01:09:45.300
food.

8c99afb8-3dda-4c21-b8b7-f9626a6c1273-0
01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:51.935
{OK, good. That was about 3
minutes and we will move on to

8c99afb8-3dda-4c21-b8b7-f9626a6c1273-1
01:09:51.935 --> 01:09:56.286
the next one. It's another part
of the graphic novel. It has 6

8c99afb8-3dda-4c21-b8b7-f9626a6c1273-2
01:09:56.286 --> 01:09:56.770
pages.}

377df0fc-cc0e-440f-848f-86f68fcaa82f-0
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.849
#START_arrival_6 OK, so top
left, um, looks like there's a

377df0fc-cc0e-440f-848f-86f68fcaa82f-1
01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:05.198
vase on it on a dresser next to
a window and then looks like

377df0fc-cc0e-440f-848f-86f68fcaa82f-2
01:10:05.198 --> 01:10:08.108
there's a little bird type
insect creature that goes

377df0fc-cc0e-440f-848f-86f68fcaa82f-3
01:10:08.108 --> 01:10:10.250
towards it and sits on the edge
of it.

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-0
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.238
And then you see in a mirror
reflection somebody who's

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-1
01:10:14.238 --> 01:10:17.979
writing or through the window,
you see somebody who's writing

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-2
01:10:17.979 --> 01:10:21.418
something with like an old
style, like pen and paper and

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-3
01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:25.159
like a Lantern next to it or
lamp. And then you see have more

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-4
01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:28.417
up close that somebody is
writing. And they fold that

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-5
01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:32.158
written document or something up
into like a paper crane. And

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-6
01:10:32.158 --> 01:10:35.899
they put that paper crane into
an envelope and they put money

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-7
01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:39.700
in with it. And then they sell
the envelope and put a stamp on

06f9e1da-562c-46ae-a91d-7d7ff8e9bf64-8
01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.449
it and then you see somebody.

2872d826-5479-407a-8500-3a95919557a2-0
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.907
Uh, the guy walking like in a
suit with the little white fish

2872d826-5479-407a-8500-3a95919557a2-1
01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.950
type creature next to him, and
he's walking downstairs.

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-0
01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.930
With the envelope in his hand
and then he stops and talks to a

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-1
01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:56.475
woman in the street and she's
carrying a basket and she's

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-2
01:10:56.475 --> 01:10:59.837
pointing to a different
direction. So he goes over and

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-3
01:10:59.837 --> 01:11:03.382
there's presumably like a a
mailbox and it's like a white

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-4
01:11:03.382 --> 01:11:07.294
shaped square and it has like a
cone top and two sides. So wing

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-5
01:11:07.294 --> 01:11:11.145
type sides to it. He puts his
letter in there and then you see

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-6
01:11:11.145 --> 01:11:14.934
him looking up at the sky and
then whenever he starts walking

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-7
01:11:14.934 --> 01:11:18.724
away to further span out picture
you see him walking and it's

14438a96-73d0-40e5-b846-6f2f542b9c4d-8
01:11:18.724 --> 01:11:19.029
like.

ebf5f9a7-438c-427e-8f12-9aec41d9d45e-0
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.850
down hills. And there's like
trees that are actually they

ebf5f9a7-438c-427e-8f12-9aec41d9d45e-1
01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:24.560
look like leaves, but they're
trees. And then you see the

ebf5f9a7-438c-427e-8f12-9aec41d9d45e-2
01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.597
little mailbox now almost looks
like it has a big balloon on top

ebf5f9a7-438c-427e-8f12-9aec41d9d45e-3
01:11:27.597 --> 01:11:29.419
of it and it's floating up in
the air.

b7d11807-6dfa-419f-b79d-972a88e79fac-0
01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.622
So then you see those trees that
look like leaves. It's the

b7d11807-6dfa-419f-b79d-972a88e79fac-1
01:11:35.622 --> 01:11:38.704
leaves sticking out of the
ground, and then it kind of

b7d11807-6dfa-419f-b79d-972a88e79fac-2
01:11:38.704 --> 01:11:42.123
starts splitting from the top
down, so it splits in half and

b7d11807-6dfa-419f-b79d-972a88e79fac-3
01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:43.020
then you see it.

5c599e6c-2472-4a84-83df-b39e35d4e0a7-0
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.580
Start to get like the like
almost like a piece of pollen

5c599e6c-2472-4a84-83df-b39e35d4e0a7-1
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.796
towards the center sticking out
and that piece of pollen becomes

5c599e6c-2472-4a84-83df-b39e35d4e0a7-2
01:11:50.796 --> 01:11:53.765
more of a wider circle and then
the leaf part of it kind of

5c599e6c-2472-4a84-83df-b39e35d4e0a7-3
01:11:53.765 --> 01:11:56.931
falls off and falls apart. And
then you see that smaller circle

5c599e6c-2472-4a84-83df-b39e35d4e0a7-4
01:11:56.931 --> 01:12:00.098
that was originally that strand
of pollen is now turning into a

5c599e6c-2472-4a84-83df-b39e35d4e0a7-5
01:12:00.098 --> 01:12:02.820
big circle almost with like a
Daisy type flower in it.

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-0
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:07.106
And it starts to glow really
brightly and then starts to get

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-1
01:12:07.106 --> 01:12:10.741
like small like fuzzes around
the edges. And then those small

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-2
01:12:10.741 --> 01:12:14.376
little fuzzy pieces start to fly
off and then you has becomes

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-3
01:12:14.376 --> 01:12:17.894
darker and then it's becoming
more like a rounded edge type

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-4
01:12:17.894 --> 01:12:21.646
flower with white streaks in it.
And now you see little insects

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-5
01:12:21.646 --> 01:12:25.340
or birds flying around it and
then you see those white streaks

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-6
01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.975
are becoming bigger almost like
little seeds and they pop off

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-7
01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:32.434
and they're now on the ground
and you see little creatures

f7379f88-592d-4ae8-89e1-1ee81c71df90-8
01:12:32.434 --> 01:12:33.490
around it as well.

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-0
01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.859
So then now that flower is just
like a big dark Gray rounded

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-1
01:12:37.859 --> 01:12:41.359
edge type flower. And then you
see it slowly start to like

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-2
01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:44.800
disintegrate and then those
pieces fall to the ground and

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-3
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.538
then it becomes basically just
like a skeleton of a flower and

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-4
01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:52.275
then it looks like it's maybe
snowing outside and then you see

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-5
01:12:52.275 --> 01:12:56.013
the snow start to grow on the
ground and then coming up to the

0b36827f-8ff0-4bba-b2ef-35573bea5f87-6
01:12:56.013 --> 01:12:57.200
level of the flower.

e039c651-436f-447d-9c91-a65e2c905080-0
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.943
So then you see a big span out
of like a cityscape or a

e039c651-436f-447d-9c91-a65e2c905080-1
01:13:03.943 --> 01:13:07.975
building on the left. You see
really tall building towards the

e039c651-436f-447d-9c91-a65e2c905080-2
01:13:07.975 --> 01:13:11.878
top with lots of windows, and
there's some intricate details

e039c651-436f-447d-9c91-a65e2c905080-3
01:13:11.878 --> 01:13:15.910
on those roofs, like a arch and
some other things sticking up.

1bdf8e46-688d-42d6-a144-a18408e0ece8-0
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:19.400
And then on the left of that
building.

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-0
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:23.096
There's um, you see some
chimneys and smokestacks,

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-1
01:13:23.096 --> 01:13:26.619
different layers, and then down
on the ground you see like a

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-2
01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:29.970
street and there's like weird
type ships that are kind of

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-3
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:33.494
floating around. You see some
cones that are sticking out of

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-4
01:13:33.494 --> 01:13:36.960
the ground and then there's
another larger building towards

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-5
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.137
the right of that and they
there's cones on the top of

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-6
01:13:40.137 --> 01:13:43.603
that. It looks like there's
almost like streets or walkways

501c8d85-698b-45b3-8660-d58323acb05c-7
01:13:43.603 --> 01:13:44.990
on top of that building.

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-0
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:50.420
And then on the right you see
it's like a bunch of like hills.

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-1
01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.153
And then right in the center
there's a big cone with like a

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-2
01:13:54.153 --> 01:13:57.887
circle on it, some kind of a
building structure. And on the

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-3
01:13:57.887 --> 01:14:01.683
left part of the screen there is
a lot of rounded buildings.

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-4
01:14:01.683 --> 01:14:05.479
There's some chimney stacks,
there's more like a cylindrical

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-5
01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:09.275
cylinder type building. And then
there's almost like pots or

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-6
01:14:09.275 --> 01:14:12.946
vases on top of it. What it
looks like the top you can see

b48bc0e6-f3b3-4801-b171-a24a11ca0a8a-7
01:14:12.946 --> 01:14:16.119
further in the distance like
those boats that are.

02062c52-399e-44c0-8706-2784fd3e5960-0
01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.244
Flying in the air and this looks
like windy or like snowy windy

02062c52-399e-44c0-8706-2784fd3e5960-1
01:14:20.244 --> 01:14:21.150
in the picture.

a5aa10f0-c677-4dd5-be2a-7190b15931f8-0
01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.515
So the top left you see a vase
with some starting to see some

a5aa10f0-c677-4dd5-be2a-7190b15931f8-1
01:14:27.515 --> 01:14:30.510
things popping out of it and
then you see that there's like

a5aa10f0-c677-4dd5-be2a-7190b15931f8-2
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:33.406
little babies or something and
then there's like a larger

a5aa10f0-c677-4dd5-be2a-7190b15931f8-3
01:14:33.406 --> 01:14:36.451
intersector birth type thing
that's coming and bringing food

a5aa10f0-c677-4dd5-be2a-7190b15931f8-4
01:14:36.451 --> 01:14:37.699
to those 3 little babies.

2512ec95-9d9e-43eb-98b2-53123e94538b-0
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.190
And then you see.

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-0
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:44.968
On the bottom you see the man
who's sitting on an edge of a

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-1
01:14:44.968 --> 01:14:48.486
bed holding a picture of the the
three of them. And there's

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-2
01:14:48.486 --> 01:14:51.828
little white fish creature
sitting next to him, shoes on

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-3
01:14:51.828 --> 01:14:55.697
the ground. And there's a a desk
and chair and there's some books

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-4
01:14:55.697 --> 01:14:59.333
on the desk and there's like a
Lantern lamp on the desk right

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-5
01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:02.792
outside the window ledge is
where you see that little vase

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-6
01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:06.427
with the insect bird type thing
that came and brought food to

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-7
01:15:06.427 --> 01:15:09.652
the little babies in the vase,
you see closing up on a

db429e79-8141-49f5-b740-d4fbcdc8f543-8
01:15:09.652 --> 01:15:11.059
clothesline in the room.

e00c2c37-e3ae-4a30-8768-23f8709a2947-0
01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:14.768
And then there's papers that are
taped to the wall and you see a

e00c2c37-e3ae-4a30-8768-23f8709a2947-1
01:15:14.768 --> 01:15:18.062
little bookcase on the left with
some cylinder and cone shaped

e00c2c37-e3ae-4a30-8768-23f8709a2947-2
01:15:18.062 --> 01:15:20.990
cone shaped things on there. And
then there's a larger.

14337260-7ea7-4a84-8409-ca8aecef6162-0
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:24.340
Vessel to the left of him, also
on a shelf.

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-0
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.569
So on the right you see the
little white fish type animal

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-1
01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:31.945
sitting next to him on the bed
and it gets up and it bounces

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-2
01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:35.431
off the bed. He looks over to
see where it went. It looks like

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-3
01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:38.641
it's going down through a hole
in the floor and there's a

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-4
01:15:38.641 --> 01:15:42.293
ladder he follows that goes down
the ladder. He sees a little the

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-5
01:15:42.293 --> 01:15:45.503
whitefish thing is next to a
hole in the wall, looks like

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-6
01:15:45.503 --> 01:15:48.989
there's a letter on the floor.
So the man picks up the letter,

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-7
01:15:48.989 --> 01:15:52.420
he opens the letter inside. He
sees there's a paper crane and

05d59d94-3564-43b7-8a78-b3c265c8c5b8-8
01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.630
opens the crane up and there's a
letter and he starts to.

41cc09b4-38c4-4f34-b2ff-882ed36eafce-0
01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.780
Look out the window, holding the
letter in his hand.

565c41cb-809c-4214-a005-d6af2bc6ba8a-0
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.655
Then you see, uh, folded up like
a paper animal and it looks like

565c41cb-809c-4214-a005-d6af2bc6ba8a-1
01:16:05.655 --> 01:16:09.615
there's a couple of legs in the
long tail. Kind of looks like

565c41cb-809c-4214-a005-d6af2bc6ba8a-2
01:16:09.615 --> 01:16:12.170
the fish or white fish creature
animal.

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-0
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.921
And then you see there's like a
cone type oven type thing and it

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-1
01:16:16.921 --> 01:16:20.326
has like circles inside of
different designs. And then you

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-2
01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:24.134
see his hat and a piece of paper
or fabric hanging on the wall, a

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-3
01:16:24.134 --> 01:16:27.943
bowl with some things in it that
looks like an artichoke. There's

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-4
01:16:27.943 --> 01:16:31.463
a weird looking fork next to it.
And and then there's like a

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-5
01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:35.041
children's drawing of like the
one of those boats that are up

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-6
01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:38.389
in the air with some smoke
coming out of it. And then you

279ba9da-c05b-4fd2-8b38-5ba98913470b-7
01:16:38.389 --> 01:16:38.619
see.

6de5ebf8-da93-4717-9740-7699a80fea29-0
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:43.305
I'm not quite sure what those
are, but it's like 2 little

6de5ebf8-da93-4717-9740-7699a80fea29-1
01:16:43.305 --> 01:16:46.030
metal devices or ones almost
like a canister.

4a7b11b3-aa94-4357-a7e6-ecee50a4d12c-0
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:50.962
And then you see another
picture. There's like newspaper

4a7b11b3-aa94-4357-a7e6-ecee50a4d12c-1
01:16:50.962 --> 01:16:54.681
and a cup of tea or coffee,
little saucer on top of it. And

4a7b11b3-aa94-4357-a7e6-ecee50a4d12c-2
01:16:54.681 --> 01:16:58.647
then you see the picture of the
three of them. And then you see

4a7b11b3-aa94-4357-a7e6-ecee50a4d12c-3
01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:02.180
the guys hand putting some
change in a small kid's hand.

29913cd2-d7d7-4fe0-af41-b1c62302202f-0
01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:09.154
So then back at the table and it
looks like there is a woman, a

29913cd2-d7d7-4fe0-af41-b1c62302202f-1
01:17:09.154 --> 01:17:10.180
man and a child.

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-0
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.221
There's a little white fish with
the ground and looks like he is

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-1
01:17:15.221 --> 01:17:18.550
handing something to the little
kid and you see all the some of

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-2
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:21.827
the things that we saw in the
last pictures. In the background

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-3
01:17:21.827 --> 01:17:25.104
of this picture seems to be more
drawings on the wall. There's

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-4
01:17:25.104 --> 01:17:28.329
more things on the wall than
there was before and I see a kid

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-5
01:17:28.329 --> 01:17:31.710
putting on their boots. There's
somebody's getting something out

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-6
01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:34.675
of the little white fish
creatures mouth looks like it's

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-7
01:17:34.675 --> 01:17:38.004
the kids hat puts the kids hat,
she puts her hat on and you see

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-8
01:17:38.004 --> 01:17:41.177
her walking down the stairs with
outside now with the little

64f68aa4-efd2-4ffc-bcfd-86929eb777b6-9
01:17:41.177 --> 01:17:41.750
white fish.

e5901cc0-a4bd-4e54-8d6f-801b44457e7c-0
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.680
#END_arrival_6 Creature going
down next to some buildings and

e5901cc0-a4bd-4e54-8d6f-801b44457e7c-1
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.335
then the kids start pointing
towards some white things she

e5901cc0-a4bd-4e54-8d6f-801b44457e7c-2
01:17:49.335 --> 01:17:53.175
sees on the ground and should
men, looks like it's glowing up

e5901cc0-a4bd-4e54-8d6f-801b44457e7c-3
01:17:53.175 --> 01:17:56.768
in in the air now above her
hand. {All right, so that was

e5901cc0-a4bd-4e54-8d6f-801b44457e7c-4
01:17:56.768 --> 01:18:00.732
the story and this is the very
last one. It's another story. It

e5901cc0-a4bd-4e54-8d6f-801b44457e7c-5
01:18:00.732 --> 01:18:01.600
has 20 pages.}

d38d27c9-c637-4be4-a454-437c73f7272f-0
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:07.483
#START_journey OK, so looks like
you see a cross section of a

d38d27c9-c637-4be4-a454-437c73f7272f-1
01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:10.597
street, you see a building in
the background and then you can

d38d27c9-c637-4be4-a454-437c73f7272f-2
01:18:10.597 --> 01:18:13.460
see it's two-story building, you
can see into the rooms.

b3469ef6-7b22-4531-a6ab-4d4b497ce983-0
01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.020
On the left, on the street,
there's a street pole with

b3469ef6-7b22-4531-a6ab-4d4b497ce983-1
01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.974
lights, and there's two kids,
one or three, three or four

b3469ef6-7b22-4531-a6ab-4d4b497ce983-2
01:18:19.974 --> 01:18:22.877
kids, and then the one is on a
bicycle, ones on a like a

b3469ef6-7b22-4531-a6ab-4d4b497ce983-3
01:18:22.877 --> 01:18:26.034
skateboard, and two of them are
giving each other high fives.

b3469ef6-7b22-4531-a6ab-4d4b497ce983-4
01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:29.242
There's like a little mailbox
next to them, and then there's a

b3469ef6-7b22-4531-a6ab-4d4b497ce983-5
01:18:29.242 --> 01:18:31.279
kid who's holding like a purple
marker.

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-0
01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:35.130
And then there's a red stop
sign, stop light, and a fire

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-1
01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:38.623
hydrant. And then you can keep
going down the sidewalk. There's

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-2
01:18:38.623 --> 01:18:42.061
a kid on the stoop and he has a
little red scooter in front of

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-3
01:18:42.061 --> 01:18:45.554
them. And then in the entryway
of the house, the 1st floor, the

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-4
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.774
stairs, and pictures on the
wall, lamp and table placed on

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-5
01:18:48.774 --> 01:18:52.157
the floor coat rack. And then to
the right of that, there's a

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-6
01:18:52.157 --> 01:18:55.704
woman in the kitchen, looks like
there's a pot on the stove. And

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-7
01:18:55.704 --> 01:18:58.979
then up the 2nd floor you see a
man at a desk that's like a

ab3fc85c-8cec-49e8-9382-30a436d14a2a-8
01:18:58.979 --> 01:19:02.090
computer in front of them
sitting on a chair. Bookcases.

c43d0fa1-4721-4b0a-bd0d-61ba0ee34431-0
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.025
Behind them, and then the next
room to his right. Now you see a

c43d0fa1-4721-4b0a-bd0d-61ba0ee34431-1
01:19:06.025 --> 01:19:08.200
a girl or a boy sitting on a
couch.

ce94e7ba-0c03-4b42-b8f8-d79991001864-0
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:12.170
laying on a couch and there's an
end table next to them.

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-0
01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.575
And then left there's like a
three stage picture. At the top

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-1
01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:21.820
you see a woman on the phone,
like a a corded phone on the

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-2
01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:25.230
wall, and she has a pot in her
hand. She's stirring something

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-3
01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:28.750
on the stove. And then there's a
boy at the edge of the counter

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-4
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:31.940
with the red scooter next to
him. And then looks like now

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-5
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:35.570
he's standing behind the guy who
was on the 2nd floor at the desk

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-6
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:39.035
and computer and sitting on the
chair and then the kids behind

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-7
01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:42.335
them leaving now he has a red
kite behind him. And then you

2475747f-0396-45d1-ba89-98a3bc2a4ecd-8
01:19:42.335 --> 01:19:44.920
see the girl who's on the laying
on the couch.

5df468b9-63e5-430f-8cd4-4f72fa9fac5b-0
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.937
Looks like she has something in
her hands, like a camera or

5df468b9-63e5-430f-8cd4-4f72fa9fac5b-1
01:19:47.937 --> 01:19:50.989
something, and then the the kids
sitting next to her now looks

5df468b9-63e5-430f-8cd4-4f72fa9fac5b-2
01:19:50.989 --> 01:19:53.848
like it's a red ball he's
holding. And then the picture on

5df468b9-63e5-430f-8cd4-4f72fa9fac5b-3
01:19:53.848 --> 01:19:56.804
the right is a picture of the
kids sitting on, presumably on

5df468b9-63e5-430f-8cd4-4f72fa9fac5b-4
01:19:56.804 --> 01:19:59.760
his bed. There's a map of the
world behind him and don't see

5df468b9-63e5-430f-8cd4-4f72fa9fac5b-5
01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.020
anything red in his hands.

c4156d17-ceab-4fb2-90a1-c4b0b9521b44-0
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.970
There's a dresser and like a
little cat on the ground.

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-0
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.856
So then the kids laying on his
bed, the cats getting up and

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-1
01:20:09.856 --> 01:20:12.813
walking out the door, and he
looks behind where the cat was

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-2
01:20:12.813 --> 01:20:15.572
laying before and now the red
marker on the right side,

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-3
01:20:15.572 --> 01:20:18.627
there's a three stage picture,
there's the kid who's reaching

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-4
01:20:18.627 --> 01:20:21.633
down to pick up the marker and
there's papers around them on

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-5
01:20:21.633 --> 01:20:24.738
the ground. Then he reaches up
and he draws like an archway on

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-6
01:20:24.738 --> 01:20:27.793
the wall and the red marker. And
then looks like that Archway

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-7
01:20:27.793 --> 01:20:30.996
created a door and he's walking
it through the door, through the

01730274-39a7-4c37-8208-c1bd3eef5ac4-8
01:20:30.996 --> 01:20:33.460
wall and looks like it's green
on the other side.

474427bb-4a9e-4110-a3f4-71b3288ae7cf-0
01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.975
Now you see him walking through
the door, and the other side of

474427bb-4a9e-4110-a3f4-71b3288ae7cf-1
01:20:38.975 --> 01:20:42.187
the door is now forced, so we
walk through the base of a tree

474427bb-4a9e-4110-a3f4-71b3288ae7cf-2
01:20:42.187 --> 01:20:45.451
trunk. There's blue lanterns and
yellow soft lights glowing on

474427bb-4a9e-4110-a3f4-71b3288ae7cf-3
01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:48.508
strings through the trees, and
there's like a Little River

474427bb-4a9e-4110-a3f4-71b3288ae7cf-4
01:20:48.508 --> 01:20:50.270
that's snaking through the
trees.

8913d2a7-991a-451e-8a85-7ab66fd781b9-0
01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:56.222
So now you see the kiddies on
the edge of a wooden dock

8913d2a7-991a-451e-8a85-7ab66fd781b9-1
01:20:56.222 --> 01:20:58.510
hanging over the river or
standing over the river.

2c51c43f-6024-4ae6-825d-9bf56d6c6d48-0
01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.892
You can see his reflection in
the water with the red stick or

2c51c43f-6024-4ae6-825d-9bf56d6c6d48-1
01:21:01.892 --> 01:21:02.370
red marker.

9f0f8655-4787-4983-8a09-d429760f0030-0
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:06.791
still see the lights in the
lanterns in the trees on the

9f0f8655-4787-4983-8a09-d429760f0030-1
01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:09.823
right side, and there's more
three stage picture of the kid

9f0f8655-4787-4983-8a09-d429760f0030-2
01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.452
leaning over the dock, the
wooden dock, and drawing

9f0f8655-4787-4983-8a09-d429760f0030-3
01:21:12.452 --> 01:21:15.485
something with the red marker in
the river. It looks like a

9f0f8655-4787-4983-8a09-d429760f0030-4
01:21:15.485 --> 01:21:18.669
little arch at first and then
looks like he's drawing a little

9f0f8655-4787-4983-8a09-d429760f0030-5
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:21.500
boat and now it's a red boat
that he's in on the river.

dcc8e635-e901-41b1-a5e6-6d3b87dac704-0
01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.575
So it looks like he's gone
through the forest now, on the

dcc8e635-e901-41b1-a5e6-6d3b87dac704-1
01:21:27.575 --> 01:21:28.850
other side of the forest.

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-0
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:34.314
Through this Little River now it
looks like he's going to cross a

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-1
01:21:34.314 --> 01:21:38.471
Moat to get to his big castle
structure. Almost looked like a

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-2
01:21:38.471 --> 01:21:42.494
castle town. And then it's
really big and there's some gold

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-3
01:21:42.494 --> 01:21:45.913
arches and like domes and
there's some overpasses,

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-4
01:21:45.913 --> 01:21:49.601
bridges, and then on the right
under the one underpass

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-5
01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:53.556
overpass, they'll see like a
smaller boat as well. And the

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-6
01:21:53.556 --> 01:21:57.780
top of that, there's also a on
the top of the archway. There's

ce0e261e-0a8d-4ce3-b5fc-24076c88c135-7
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.060
like a little boat on the
bridge.

1743e963-e1b6-47ac-b8f5-e60498cd3c26-0
01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.633
And then you see the kid, um,
who now is up on the top of that

1743e963-e1b6-47ac-b8f5-e60498cd3c26-1
01:22:07.633 --> 01:22:11.466
bridge or you know, whatever
walkways, it's almost like

1743e963-e1b6-47ac-b8f5-e60498cd3c26-2
01:22:11.466 --> 01:22:15.437
little people in gondolas. And
he is. There's some guards

1743e963-e1b6-47ac-b8f5-e60498cd3c26-3
01:22:15.437 --> 01:22:19.613
waving to him and he's one of
those little walk waterways, I

1743e963-e1b6-47ac-b8f5-e60498cd3c26-4
01:22:19.613 --> 01:22:23.789
should say, on top of those
going through these castle area.

c2efa683-6d14-4578-a738-15a29e78c27d-0
01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:32.529
Then the left, you see, he's
about to go off the edge of one

c2efa683-6d14-4578-a738-15a29e78c27d-1
01:22:32.529 --> 01:22:36.310
of these waterways and there's
people and other levels of the

c2efa683-6d14-4578-a738-15a29e78c27d-2
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:39.663
gondolas and different water
because they're different

c2efa683-6d14-4578-a738-15a29e78c27d-3
01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:43.627
heights. And then on the right,
you see he's drawing a circle in

c2efa683-6d14-4578-a738-15a29e78c27d-4
01:22:43.627 --> 01:22:46.309
midair as the boats falling
underneath him.

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-0
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:52.575
And then on the left you see
that what you Drew was a big hot

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-1
01:22:52.575 --> 01:22:56.320
air balloon. And now he's riding
in a red hot air balloon and

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-2
01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:00.126
he's waving to the people in the
tower or the guards or people

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-3
01:23:00.126 --> 01:23:03.690
and whatever uniforms and they
were waving to him. And the

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-4
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:07.436
right side you see this really
big industrial type boat thing

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-5
01:23:07.436 --> 01:23:11.181
with like a a smaller little
boat flying next week next to it

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-6
01:23:11.181 --> 01:23:15.108
behind it. And then there's like
a purple creature flying in the

6c8effce-e2fa-42fb-bc59-e3ed67a7ae6f-7
01:23:15.108 --> 01:23:15.349
air.

a3544a53-bb51-440f-8cf7-960b6cf43e76-0
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.370
And then the left you see the.

4e1e6e28-6303-427c-ab20-32f0df80f468-0
01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:24.170
Boy, who's now in the hot air
balloon still and he's looking

4e1e6e28-6303-427c-ab20-32f0df80f468-1
01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:27.357
down and he sees the smaller
boat in the larger boat and

4e1e6e28-6303-427c-ab20-32f0df80f468-2
01:23:27.357 --> 01:23:30.823
looks like the people in the
smaller boat are trying to catch

4e1e6e28-6303-427c-ab20-32f0df80f468-3
01:23:30.823 --> 01:23:34.010
the purple creature that's
flying in the air with a net.

f40a7f0c-cf27-4fed-8f75-e9e91fb3e682-0
01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:41.000
And then on the left you see the
hot air balloon the kid in the

f40a7f0c-cf27-4fed-8f75-e9e91fb3e682-1
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.010
hot air balloon is getting
closer, so it looks like they

f40a7f0c-cf27-4fed-8f75-e9e91fb3e682-2
01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:47.337
did end up catching the purple
creature. It looks like it's in

f40a7f0c-cf27-4fed-8f75-e9e91fb3e682-3
01:23:47.337 --> 01:23:50.190
like a bird cage and the people
are holding on to it.

88cecad4-7876-4910-a141-02d48adeda5f-0
01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.575
Now it's getting onto the larger
big ship as well, and the large

88cecad4-7876-4910-a141-02d48adeda5f-1
01:23:55.575 --> 01:23:59.152
ship has like this gold bird
type feature towards the front

88cecad4-7876-4910-a141-02d48adeda5f-2
01:23:59.152 --> 01:23:59.509
of it.

d2dfd256-b050-487b-a560-acde54e47ec0-0
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:05.291
And then you see the kids
getting off the higher balloon

d2dfd256-b050-487b-a560-acde54e47ec0-1
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:08.417
use on this big ship. Now he
looks like he's going towards a

d2dfd256-b050-487b-a560-acde54e47ec0-2
01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:11.543
doorway. And then you see above
a different height above him

d2dfd256-b050-487b-a560-acde54e47ec0-3
01:24:11.543 --> 01:24:14.926
there's the people carrying that
purple creature in the bird cage

d2dfd256-b050-487b-a560-acde54e47ec0-4
01:24:14.926 --> 01:24:18.001
and looks like there's like a
king or something with a gold

d2dfd256-b050-487b-a560-acde54e47ec0-5
01:24:18.001 --> 01:24:20.000
crown in front of them directing
them.

ed5cb0c3-a4ec-463e-a960-7d00551f3aa6-0
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:24.575
And then on the OK and then on
the right, there was that Gold

ed5cb0c3-a4ec-463e-a960-7d00551f3aa6-1
01:24:24.575 --> 01:24:28.345
Bird feature that's like the top
part of that one ship. And then

ed5cb0c3-a4ec-463e-a960-7d00551f3aa6-2
01:24:28.345 --> 01:24:32.056
there's the kid climbing up the
ladder to get to because that's

ed5cb0c3-a4ec-463e-a960-7d00551f3aa6-3
01:24:32.056 --> 01:24:35.188
where they have the purple
creature in their cage and

ed5cb0c3-a4ec-463e-a960-7d00551f3aa6-4
01:24:35.188 --> 01:24:36.869
there's two guards around it.

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-0
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:43.356
So then the kid grabs the purple
creature that's in the cage and

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-1
01:24:43.356 --> 01:24:46.620
surprises the guards. And then
you see he ran over to the edge

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-2
01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.883
and he let the purple creature
out of the cage and it's flying

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-3
01:24:49.883 --> 01:24:53.198
away and you see the red marker
next to it. And there's a bunch

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-4
01:24:53.198 --> 01:24:56.513
of people running downstairs and
chasing after him. You can see

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-5
01:24:56.513 --> 01:24:59.569
like the cross section of the
inside of the ship, and then

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-6
01:24:59.569 --> 01:25:02.832
they're starting to come outside
on the little walkway to find

60dba078-65dd-42fb-95cc-fb8bd152df9b-7
01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:03.039
him.

31124d80-e6b6-4045-b06d-f166864b6970-0
01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.637
So it looks like they grab onto
him and then the guy with the

31124d80-e6b6-4045-b06d-f166864b6970-1
01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:13.870
gold crown or headpiece and more
of a gold uniform, he dumps the

31124d80-e6b6-4045-b06d-f166864b6970-2
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:17.972
the purple or red marker off the
edge and so it's falling. And

31124d80-e6b6-4045-b06d-f166864b6970-3
01:25:17.972 --> 01:25:22.010
then the kid now is in like this
cage type thing that they're

31124d80-e6b6-4045-b06d-f166864b6970-4
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:25.396
Wheeling either up or down
because they have like a

31124d80-e6b6-4045-b06d-f166864b6970-5
01:25:25.396 --> 01:25:27.480
steering wheel at the top of it.

fe2fe031-ed6a-4c9b-b4cc-2f540adddb83-0
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.084
So then he's in mid air and then
he sees the purple creature now

fe2fe031-ed6a-4c9b-b4cc-2f540adddb83-1
01:25:34.084 --> 01:25:37.194
has that red crayon or red
marker with them and brings it

fe2fe031-ed6a-4c9b-b4cc-2f540adddb83-2
01:25:37.194 --> 01:25:40.303
through the kid. So then the kid
is drawing a square or a

fe2fe031-ed6a-4c9b-b4cc-2f540adddb83-3
01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:40.840
rectangle.

8bf0006d-b3ea-4573-8ec0-69d9ddc8b879-0
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:45.572
And the purple creatures next to
him. Looks like he drew like a

8bf0006d-b3ea-4573-8ec0-69d9ddc8b879-1
01:25:45.572 --> 01:25:48.854
magic carpet and now he's flying
through the air. He's out of the

8bf0006d-b3ea-4573-8ec0-69d9ddc8b879-2
01:25:48.854 --> 01:25:52.136
cage and the purple creatures in
front of him, and so he's flying

8bf0006d-b3ea-4573-8ec0-69d9ddc8b879-3
01:25:52.136 --> 01:25:53.230
above the castle area.

bfab1298-04ea-449c-a7fd-6f747cf6fe5a-0
01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.428
And then you see him flying now
it's like a night sky with stars

bfab1298-04ea-449c-a7fd-6f747cf6fe5a-1
01:25:59.428 --> 01:26:02.416
in the background, the castle
towards the left, and he's

bfab1298-04ea-449c-a7fd-6f747cf6fe5a-2
01:26:02.416 --> 01:26:05.719
flying through this sky after
the purple creature, and there's

bfab1298-04ea-449c-a7fd-6f747cf6fe5a-3
01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:07.659
like a palm tree down in the
ground.

2878e8cf-0f72-4f24-a8b4-1daf13a08b36-0
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:13.653
It looks like they go to the
base of the palm tree and the

2878e8cf-0f72-4f24-a8b4-1daf13a08b36-1
01:26:13.653 --> 01:26:16.717
purple creature it has drawn
like a purple door now at the

2878e8cf-0f72-4f24-a8b4-1daf13a08b36-2
01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:19.833
bottom of the palm tree trunk
and then the kid opens up the

2878e8cf-0f72-4f24-a8b4-1daf13a08b36-3
01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:22.949
door and he goes through it
looks like the bird. The purple

2878e8cf-0f72-4f24-a8b4-1daf13a08b36-4
01:26:22.949 --> 01:26:25.650
creature goes 1st and then the
kid goes through it.

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-0
01:26:27.570 --> 01:26:30.755
And then you see the kid coming
out of what looked like was a

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-1
01:26:30.755 --> 01:26:33.941
mailbox in the first picture, so
next to the lamp post on the

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-2
01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:37.229
sidewalk. So the purple creature
comes out first, and there's a

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-3
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:40.518
kid with a purple marker who's
like running towards it with his

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-4
01:26:40.518 --> 01:26:43.600
arms outspread, and then the
little kid coming out with the

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-5
01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.786
red marker behind behind the
purple creature, and you see the

2d87d098-e571-4161-a0dd-c3b43a9bbf61-6
01:26:46.786 --> 01:26:49.149
traffic light is now green light
behind them.

2a0c999d-ee48-43c4-bf48-96dba9b58906-0
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:53.016
And then there's a three-part
picture where you see the kid on

2a0c999d-ee48-43c4-bf48-96dba9b58906-1
01:26:53.016 --> 01:26:55.925
the right holding the purple
creature in his arm, and then

2a0c999d-ee48-43c4-bf48-96dba9b58906-2
01:26:55.925 --> 01:26:58.784
he's helping up the kid with the
red marker. They're both

2a0c999d-ee48-43c4-bf48-96dba9b58906-3
01:26:58.784 --> 01:27:01.792
standing, the kids drawing a
circle with the red marker, and

2a0c999d-ee48-43c4-bf48-96dba9b58906-4
01:27:01.792 --> 01:27:04.849
then the other kid draws the
purple circles. They both have a

2a0c999d-ee48-43c4-bf48-96dba9b58906-5
01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:06.920
red and a purple circle in front
of them.

5c5ba0ef-fa6c-44de-a2ba-a6053073b41b-0
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:11.316
#END_journey And then it looks
like they use those circles to

5c5ba0ef-fa6c-44de-a2ba-a6053073b41b-1
01:27:11.316 --> 01:27:13.853
become part of the wheels of a
bicycle, and then the kid with

5c5ba0ef-fa6c-44de-a2ba-a6053073b41b-2
01:27:13.853 --> 01:27:16.226
the red markers towards the
front of the bicycle, the kid

5c5ba0ef-fa6c-44de-a2ba-a6053073b41b-3
01:27:16.226 --> 01:27:18.763
with the purple markers towards
the back, and then the purple

5c5ba0ef-fa6c-44de-a2ba-a6053073b41b-4
01:27:18.763 --> 01:27:21.299
creatures flying behind them.
And they're on a bicycle on the

5c5ba0ef-fa6c-44de-a2ba-a6053073b41b-5
01:27:21.299 --> 01:27:21.749
street now.

bec8f382-617e-4f06-8944-864e0c4cc0b5-0
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:26.410
{That was the story and the end
of the study.}

83c04592-aad5-4b57-869d-3d0e8c425a21-0
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.000
