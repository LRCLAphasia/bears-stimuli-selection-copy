00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.950
OK.

f5e4740d-2687-4832-893e-a0815faa2363-0
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.000
So we're going to start off with
a complex scene.

dd821ab7-3d62-42b4-97f8-68c3e0f00093-0
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.482
So you are about to see a
complex scene. Imagine you are

dd821ab7-3d62-42b4-97f8-68c3e0f00093-1
00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:15.273
describing the scene to someone
who cannot see the picture.

dd821ab7-3d62-42b4-97f8-68c3e0f00093-2
00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:16.980
Describe what is happening.

e43097f4-dff2-463e-af35-bcd461e1ad49-0
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.958
What is happening and what you
see in the scene as thoroughly

e43097f4-dff2-463e-af35-bcd461e1ad49-1
00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.362
as possible. And then with
complex scenes we ask that you

e43097f4-dff2-463e-af35-bcd461e1ad49-2
00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:29.119
take between 3 to 5 minutes to
describe them and I will pull it

e43097f4-dff2-463e-af35-bcd461e1ad49-3
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:29.530
up now.

910a4e91-0882-44fc-9767-6a51cd232572-0
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.404
So will you be timing me or
should I time myself or I'll

910a4e91-0882-44fc-9767-6a51cd232572-1
00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:53.180
have a timer just to keep us on
track so that that's fine?

45b1ecc1-ac12-4fc9-a0a4-39e068cae370-0
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:13.220


782c8f95-2508-4642-aa76-3a5cb34156f7-0
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.030
OK.

de20d69e-3ea6-4509-a130-6aaaaf00a010-0
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.370
OK.

0e3242fc-459b-4ec0-b95b-4aab7c6e6d9e-0
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.695
Is this a where's Waldo? Yes,
some of them. Some of them are,

0e3242fc-459b-4ec0-b95b-4aab7c6e6d9e-1
00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:47.307
but so just describe what you
see in the scene and what is

0e3242fc-459b-4ec0-b95b-4aab7c6e6d9e-2
00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:47.920
happening.

9ec3f3c4-3c58-46b4-bca7-9dcb5643ce7b-0
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780
So is this the same scene?

ec9ec8bb-0504-4984-a4a0-e7135869e9d9-0
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.833
Is there's because there's a
white line down the middle.

ec9ec8bb-0504-4984-a4a0-e7135869e9d9-1
00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:00.984
Yeah, we just, it's, it's like
on the pages. Yeah. It was a

ec9ec8bb-0504-4984-a4a0-e7135869e9d9-2
00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:05.066
book. So when we scanned it,
yeah, it like kind of weirdly

ec9ec8bb-0504-4984-a4a0-e7135869e9d9-3
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.280
overlaps a little bit. Yeah. OK.

566a15e2-cf19-4586-ac8d-888b1a7f998e-0
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.666
#START_dinasours_spacemen_and_ghouls
This is a picture of it's lots

566a15e2-cf19-4586-ac8d-888b1a7f998e-1
00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:19.321
of bright colors with lots of
people, and it looks like it

566a15e2-cf19-4586-ac8d-888b1a7f998e-2
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.898
goes. It's a picture on the left
side of the beginning of

566a15e2-cf19-4586-ac8d-888b1a7f998e-3
00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:24.530
mankind.

891d8fe2-555d-47e2-bdf3-1962fb4fff43-0
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.110
You have.

f10afdd2-7b9c-43a5-b4f8-88ddc96f9528-0
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.410
Prehistoric creatures like.

495b821f-3681-4432-9255-e3776245d203-0
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.882
Stegosaurus dinosaurs and
brontosaurus dinosaurs and

495b821f-3681-4432-9255-e3776245d203-1
00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:38.610
Cavemen.

07845b5c-0b63-4971-b591-e3c6da6c335d-0
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.160
Wearing fur.

9eee60ae-f8b7-4925-9e07-928f30413a2b-0
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.910
Jackets and.

4712b7fa-fd91-4e1b-9a40-0d0171e8c715-0
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.854
Kind of like toga type things,
but made of fur. And there are

4712b7fa-fd91-4e1b-9a40-0d0171e8c715-1
00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:57.723
some Cavemen climbing up what
looks like a volcano with lava

4712b7fa-fd91-4e1b-9a40-0d0171e8c715-2
00:02:57.723 --> 00:03:01.860
flying out and there are a
couple Cavemen.

02369427-361f-45f7-a710-9bf43999430a-0
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.900
On top of the lava flying
through the air with, one has a.

2f0105e0-819e-4e0f-b162-a70a580ed4e5-0
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.620
A typical caveman wooden stick
that he beats the animals with.

da31d614-180c-4fc2-911d-694a203435a3-0
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.080
And then there are just.

b396e5b2-6644-4a20-9b7b-51ff68e7b953-0
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.660
OK, so it looks like this might
be part of a movie.

8533406f-32be-4d88-97b2-569d2662899f-0
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.625
Film a movie scene because below
the main picture where there are

8533406f-32be-4d88-97b2-569d2662899f-1
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.300
all the Cavemen and dinosaurs.

82c7f2b3-b845-4fb5-92ae-a032bffbd0e4-0
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.256
There are there's two rooms
where they're doing makeup and

82c7f2b3-b845-4fb5-92ae-a032bffbd0e4-1
00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:44.445
they're setting up the scene
with a big star over it and

82c7f2b3-b845-4fb5-92ae-a032bffbd0e4-2
00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:47.900
there are doors going in and out
of the scene.

a2add679-9a57-4f29-a4ff-55163b97dc85-0
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.679
Umm, so that's one part of it.
And then the second part, um on

a2add679-9a57-4f29-a4ff-55163b97dc85-1
00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:58.717
the same page in the right hand
corner and they're also doing a

a2add679-9a57-4f29-a4ff-55163b97dc85-2
00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:01.630
scene with uh mummies where
they're.

d55ade95-e71a-4a1f-a295-5503d091945f-0
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.290
I guess it must have to do with.

6301185f-b5e0-40a9-b0e2-3e33574ed12b-0
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.480
Some part of the scary.

084c010b-d230-43bf-908b-a67c543d3977-0
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.800
Some part of a scary movie with
mummies and bats and.

c5ced10b-09c6-47ac-a5b4-ff1b1d2722f6-0
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.570
They have people getting mummies
ready and they're teaching them

c5ced10b-09c6-47ac-a5b4-ff1b1d2722f6-1
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.215
how to walk, but there's still
some dinosaurs in that part of

c5ced10b-09c6-47ac-a5b4-ff1b1d2722f6-2
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:26.189
the show too.

28c0ceb4-ac61-451b-90cb-f10c10b3010e-0
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.345
So it's a little bit confusing,
but that's page the left side of

28c0ceb4-ac61-451b-90cb-f10c10b3010e-1
00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:38.205
the page. On the right side of
the page we've moved up to a

28c0ceb4-ac61-451b-90cb-f10c10b3010e-2
00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:43.389
scene where there are. We're out
in space at on some spaceship,

28c0ceb4-ac61-451b-90cb-f10c10b3010e-3
00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.006
and now there are green
Martians. Looks like maybe we're

28c0ceb4-ac61-451b-90cb-f10c10b3010e-4
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:52.300
on Mars. Again, it's also part
of a movie they have.

4cb5d2e6-cc46-4ae9-91e3-766e75b2a015-0
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.380
They have big spotlights that
are.

f7b59f4a-c80c-4c2e-a4f8-08d2e0fc6f05-0
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.190
Focused on the movie, on this,
on the scene. It's also a

f7b59f4a-c80c-4c2e-a4f8-08d2e0fc6f05-1
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.980
backdrop. They have this.

44a3a2f2-4d04-423b-9156-951f176b96e8-0
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.261
Screen that's dropping down with
the backdrop with spaceships and

44a3a2f2-4d04-423b-9156-951f176b96e8-1
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:17.112
astronauts, and the spaceships
are pink with little green

44a3a2f2-4d04-423b-9156-951f176b96e8-2
00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:22.550
aliens inside them, kind of with
a glass bubble on top. And then

44a3a2f2-4d04-423b-9156-951f176b96e8-3
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.904
there's like a a ship looking,
like a boat looking thing that's

44a3a2f2-4d04-423b-9156-951f176b96e8-4
00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:29.410
flying in the air.

25862277-87e9-45b3-8af8-f658e18c9f20-0
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.870
And.

bb358d9b-6c7a-4490-a394-171dc01705ed-0
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.660
There are.

b98d4724-463f-4c1e-b59e-4256f64719f7-0
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.005
Looks like the directors on on
standing there telling them how

b98d4724-463f-4c1e-b59e-4256f64719f7-1
00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:45.122
to act. The astronauts and,
astronauts and the the Green

b98d4724-463f-4c1e-b59e-4256f64719f7-2
00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:46.290
Martians are.

2e9cc6af-293d-4fca-9cac-720879c36782-0
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.778
Co-mingling together on in the
scene and there's a I see

2e9cc6af-293d-4fca-9cac-720879c36782-1
00:05:51.778 --> 00:05:56.119
somebody has a microphone pole
there so that they can hear the

2e9cc6af-293d-4fca-9cac-720879c36782-2
00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.740
dialogue.

3648c5c8-286e-4b25-b0e9-1c382bc8d44a-0
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.133
Um, and there's a painter
painting the backdrop as well.

3648c5c8-286e-4b25-b0e9-1c382bc8d44a-1
00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:07.222
He's got a blue paint brush and
he's painting the the scene of

3648c5c8-286e-4b25-b0e9-1c382bc8d44a-2
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:11.180
the the stars and the moon in
the sky where the.

35697f91-c1ad-441c-85a9-60e25760ebd0-0
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.940
The spaceships are flying and.

b7a24377-4d7c-4398-8dbd-5194ef4ad0da-0
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.550
Then below the spaceship scene
you have.

888d4c5a-b064-4eb3-93d2-3a7b43901719-0
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.350
A group of people that I really
can't see very well.

87a7f3ea-2883-4b15-bb70-5ceff484642b-0
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.738
They're in a room. Some people
are looks like eating lunch or

87a7f3ea-2883-4b15-bb70-5ceff484642b-1
00:06:31.738 --> 00:06:36.947
something. Maybe they're the
crew that's taking a break while

87a7f3ea-2883-4b15-bb70-5ceff484642b-2
00:06:36.947 --> 00:06:39.300
the filming is going on and.

37e1ec99-a7bd-4b68-86ed-5a158262ed97-0
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.650
And then that's pretty much it,
but it looks like it's just

37e1ec99-a7bd-4b68-86ed-5a158262ed97-1
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.830
seems in progress of history.

e1a8f97b-4ffe-4066-8565-c4d92f96ba2f-0
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.960
Where you have the spaceman.

0af72ed6-790b-4c4a-ae5d-fc999a7f835a-0
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.404
Where you have the the
prehistoric Cavemen, the

0af72ed6-790b-4c4a-ae5d-fc999a7f835a-1
00:06:55.404 --> 00:07:00.068
dinosaurs, and then you have a
scary movie that's being filmed

0af72ed6-790b-4c4a-ae5d-fc999a7f835a-2
00:07:00.068 --> 00:07:02.290
with mummies and monsters and.

9a87fdbb-7a72-40ca-beb7-ec3ef1617ebb-0
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.446
Lots of movie things like
spotlights and filming cameras

9a87fdbb-7a72-40ca-beb7-ec3ef1617ebb-1
00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:13.859
and microphone stands, and then
you have a scene where they have

9a87fdbb-7a72-40ca-beb7-ec3ef1617ebb-2
00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:18.439
a where the crew is getting
their food and everybody's

9a87fdbb-7a72-40ca-beb7-ec3ef1617ebb-3
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:22.270
getting fed during the filming
of the scenes.

1b1f84ae-3f50-4a1e-b47b-4bf399c0686b-0
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.180
The end.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.400
OK, Next is a short story I'll
pull up the directions for.

f3551eca-92e7-4e0a-8500-b82a055efd94-0
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.590
Short stories.

ed7be638-9fc3-4562-8bea-d10fc10e6654-0
00:07:50.350 --> 00:08:05.630


eba0d4b2-8173-4874-a562-69f82c269dfe-0
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.030
OK.

f8beec4f-6147-4723-b3bf-9df4ff7914c7-0
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.874
So for short stories, you're
going to look at a series of

f8beec4f-6147-4723-b3bf-9df4ff7914c7-1
00:08:20.874 --> 00:08:24.310
pictures to tell a story.
Imagine you were telling the

f8beec4f-6147-4723-b3bf-9df4ff7914c7-2
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.309
story to someone who cannot see
the pictures. Describe what you

f8beec4f-6147-4723-b3bf-9df4ff7914c7-3
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:32.308
see and what is happening as you
go through the story, and then

f8beec4f-6147-4723-b3bf-9df4ff7914c7-4
00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:35.620
I'll let you know how many pages
each story is also.

272622c9-061d-496d-b96a-6f053625ad2a-0
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.981
Uh, when you're done describing
a page, you could ask me to

272622c9-061d-496d-b96a-6f053625ad2a-1
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:41.870
like, flip to the next page, OK?

6878319c-2412-425a-9829-3e6750b7ffd9-0
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.650
OK.

844d78b7-5366-4dda-9d46-b071387a735f-0
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.400
Let me pull it up now.

1774a8e5-05f6-4ab9-a5b7-d56aa08ae0e2-0
00:08:50.050 --> 00:09:09.440


1e718bf9-62f5-4b3d-b13b-bccce497166d-0
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.100
OK.

617d5b60-bdf5-4a6f-999a-896079835d6f-0
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.090
Actually there.

93cd83f6-a9e3-4c6e-8319-26cc9ce64b0b-0
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.640
What's going into the bubble?

e5027efe-8852-4d2b-a0fe-924d93ff822f-0
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.670
What is that?

77baa5b8-09ab-4d69-85dc-48763df23d67-0
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.834
Um, so you have to just describe
what you think it is. I mean

77baa5b8-09ab-4d69-85dc-48763df23d67-1
00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:42.410
this, this book is also some of
the stuff is kind of

77baa5b8-09ab-4d69-85dc-48763df23d67-2
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.460
imaginative, so you kind of just
have to give a name to it.

a7c87ba3-3641-4e01-b733-b8c4b2c6d6a3-0
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.840
OK.

026fea45-8452-46ba-95c1-43de07a4b82a-0
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.470
No clue. I wouldn't even start.

05f05629-7025-41a9-bdd7-ec67e4ec46c2-0
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.220
OK. Umm.

0ea4260e-cc76-4520-8efc-83d71c877a5e-0
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.590
6 some kind of tiny OK so.

90024ef6-b547-4f89-9e01-45567b38595c-0
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.140
Umm.

2c7df7d0-84ad-4bed-bd44-28818d0e9162-0
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.780
#START_arrival_6 I'm going to
tell you a story of a.

ebec7852-c6c8-4d5a-bc5f-83f1fcb95160-0
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.810
A man.

2712f0af-5987-431e-a608-fe98116834a3-0
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.060
New.

bc8978e0-c9a6-4c74-b84f-f1471b1cbd48-0
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.370
Decides to write a note and send
some money to his.

56050d3c-6ed5-4cfe-b64e-b797b3bd73aa-0
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:33.604
His wife and children. He has to
be away from home working

56050d3c-6ed5-4cfe-b64e-b797b3bd73aa-1
00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:36.950
because he was unable to find a
job.

158da118-9045-4a98-8e8d-9c3d97051172-0
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.830
And then on his table, there was
a pot.

16e4a379-50e4-4351-9322-24b511a0576b-0
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.490
And that little dragon flew into
the pot.

0d11bb46-fb9d-46b0-a3e4-bb24b59c74b3-0
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.419
Because it was just sitting
there and and there was a can't.

0d11bb46-fb9d-46b0-a3e4-bb24b59c74b3-1
00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.100
It's it's.

7460cfcf-5051-4e4d-864a-a4f4a207c3a9-0
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.530
I think the pot was on the
window sill, but anyway, the man

7460cfcf-5051-4e4d-864a-a4f4a207c3a9-1
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.880
is is.

84f97929-abb3-4f88-acf2-8daae172383e-0
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.366
And flew into the pot and
decided to make it its home

84f97929-abb3-4f88-acf2-8daae172383e-1
00:11:17.366 --> 00:11:19.450
while the man was writing a
letter.

5ae20d3a-e48d-45b5-9646-1ebfd42e107f-0
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:27.125
And it's he's looking out a
window in this pot is sitting on

5ae20d3a-e48d-45b5-9646-1ebfd42e107f-1
00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:32.772
the window sill, and on the same
desk with the man is sitting

5ae20d3a-e48d-45b5-9646-1ebfd42e107f-2
00:11:32.772 --> 00:11:38.237
writing the letter. He has an
inkwell because he's using an

5ae20d3a-e48d-45b5-9646-1ebfd42e107f-3
00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:40.970
old ink pen and a gas Lantern.

54ee05b0-e609-45b6-94fc-998c170918ac-0
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:48.935
A kerosene Lantern. The story's
taking place in about the 1920s,

54ee05b0-e609-45b6-94fc-998c170918ac-1
00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:51.560
maybe 1900s, early 1900s.

bd171653-e5ac-425e-ab2d-006f38d1785b-0
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.671
So he finishes his ladder and he
decides to, rather than just do

bd171653-e5ac-425e-ab2d-006f38d1785b-1
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:02.889
a regular folding, he does a
makes a beautiful bird that kind

bd171653-e5ac-425e-ab2d-006f38d1785b-2
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:06.930
of looked like the bird that
flew into the pot.

72bb07c2-884d-4b2e-9762-ff799f881b83-0
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.823
Out of his letter, because he
thought that his children would

72bb07c2-884d-4b2e-9762-ff799f881b83-1
00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:17.433
enjoy it. So he finishes his
letter and he folds it up and

72bb07c2-884d-4b2e-9762-ff799f881b83-2
00:12:17.433 --> 00:12:22.199
into this beautiful bird and he
slips it inside the envelope

72bb07c2-884d-4b2e-9762-ff799f881b83-3
00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:22.590
with.

d96e8c91-be60-44f7-94c4-fc1c663936cf-0
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.629
Lots of money. All the money
that he made while he's been

d96e8c91-be60-44f7-94c4-fc1c663936cf-1
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:32.089
away. And then he fixes a stamp.
He licks the envelope and fixes

d96e8c91-be60-44f7-94c4-fc1c663936cf-2
00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:33.049
a stamp to it.

dcb0c1a7-406b-47a3-9453-7efbba9eae88-0
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.770
And he has an interesting pet.

c1865ceb-6203-4f4e-a1c7-1228f65737aa-0
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.913
That looks like the little pig,
but it has a long tail, so maybe

c1865ceb-6203-4f4e-a1c7-1228f65737aa-1
00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:48.879
it's a shark that got legs and
has a couple ears and it's white

c1865ceb-6203-4f4e-a1c7-1228f65737aa-2
00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:51.750
and he gathers his little pig
shark.

832f08a0-0deb-4a57-8979-072f4ab0688e-0
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.862
And takes them for a walk out.
He walks down the steps from his

832f08a0-0deb-4a57-8979-072f4ab0688e-1
00:12:56.862 --> 00:12:59.570
apartments and on the street he
meets.

54e25f3d-48c7-42ac-88fd-56e259ce1110-0
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.926
A nice woman who has an
interesting iguana in her

54e25f3d-48c7-42ac-88fd-56e259ce1110-1
00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:05.520
basket.

fe9b9438-6c8b-4ee6-a7a8-412fb4b9b1b2-0
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.000
And he asks her directions to.

d9479897-1573-4d9d-a27d-63ed27ba360f-0
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.130
How to mail his letter.

92202544-4eee-4f52-89ee-f1af39e27cea-0
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.754
And she points in the direction
of where he should go, and he

92202544-4eee-4f52-89ee-f1af39e27cea-1
00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:16.660
and his little.

a5fd3d47-6273-4014-a1dd-39ba6044396d-0
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.580
pet shark Walk to the mailbox.

2fb8af24-e843-4130-b7e8-eb9e5449eef0-0
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.648
That has all kinds of
instructions on how to open the

2fb8af24-e843-4130-b7e8-eb9e5449eef0-1
00:13:25.648 --> 00:13:30.136
mail. He has to press a few
buttons and it's a very strange

2fb8af24-e843-4130-b7e8-eb9e5449eef0-2
00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:34.923
looking mailbox. But he seems to
understand what he needs to do

2fb8af24-e843-4130-b7e8-eb9e5449eef0-3
00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:39.784
and he presses the button, turns
the key and he looks up because

2fb8af24-e843-4130-b7e8-eb9e5449eef0-4
00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:41.580
as he does those things.

2c18476d-bb55-4fcb-bb4b-8b62dba4d7d2-0
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.823
And he put his letter in, the
mailbox floats into the air. I

2c18476d-bb55-4fcb-bb4b-8b62dba4d7d2-1
00:13:46.823 --> 00:13:48.620
guess when he turned the.

16a6511e-317e-415a-856c-4552396935b9-0
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.890
The key, a balloon.

7225aa22-b4b4-4349-a527-6ce2904c3461-0
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.550
Came up and lifted up the.

7ea0ed3c-ccb5-40a1-b4fb-b6e83fe4ceea-0
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.290
Mailbox, and now his letter is
on its way.

490b098a-3c89-4160-bceb-7de00c014931-0
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.660
And he and his little pig shark.

aa2c9ad7-f0d0-4f37-bf9f-a5b134e2b667-0
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.180
Walk home through the forest.
You can turn the page.

b128d229-947a-4966-8e39-6417c7f2cd09-0
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.770
And that's an.

08ebe367-8ade-4e07-b109-1b11245df51b-0
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:33.810


16789661-bc28-4b5f-b095-ce9d02efff22-0
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:39.356
In half and one side falls to
one part of the of the ground,

16789661-bc28-4b5f-b095-ce9d02efff22-1
00:14:39.356 --> 00:14:44.775
and the other side falls to the
other, and out of the leaf grows

16789661-bc28-4b5f-b095-ce9d02efff22-2
00:14:44.775 --> 00:14:46.610
this beautiful flower.

0182a642-012c-4e85-9ad0-411f768aed72-0
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.795
And it's the same flower that
that was on the stamp that he

0182a642-012c-4e85-9ad0-411f768aed72-1
00:14:52.795 --> 00:14:58.450
put on the letter that he mailed
to his wife and children. And

0182a642-012c-4e85-9ad0-411f768aed72-2
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.925
these flowers grow in the wind,
in the snow, and it grows to

0182a642-012c-4e85-9ad0-411f768aed72-3
00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:05.810
this beautiful bright

dd9a6388-68f0-433f-96e2-613c2eb79ae9-0
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.600
Wheel that looks like a little.

ffe0343c-2f3e-4b17-b59e-d0ea4e52bb40-0
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.113
Dandelion thing that you can
blow and the seeds blow

ffe0343c-2f3e-4b17-b59e-d0ea4e52bb40-1
00:15:16.113 --> 00:15:20.782
everywhere, and so the seeds
come off of it and underneath

ffe0343c-2f3e-4b17-b59e-d0ea4e52bb40-2
00:15:20.782 --> 00:15:23.710
the seeds there's another
beautiful.

1de5c2e5-6590-40ef-816d-877feb9cd079-0
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.296
A flower, but it looks more like
it's a red flower and on that

1de5c2e5-6590-40ef-816d-877feb9cd079-1
00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:30.940
flower.

3b3d4121-0390-4cfe-9616-3c5cf6d696bf-0
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.660
The seeds are growing or holes
are growing in the flower.

3c9fe26d-8e66-40df-a659-d13937c2b8c7-0
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.180
And.

2cd0dfea-0fae-4067-a41a-b5c954ac254a-0
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.600
Umm.

16ea1b2f-af21-4cec-b2c5-cc334f1ae623-0
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.930
Maybe.

780e2349-d19d-4058-aa66-91e078ac7b87-0
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.129
{Sorry, this isn't really a
story I'm trying to figure out

780e2349-d19d-4058-aa66-91e078ac7b87-1
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:53.460
as I go along.} The flower
starts to get eaten away and the

780e2349-d19d-4058-aa66-91e078ac7b87-2
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.720
petals are starting to drop and
it's becoming a beautiful.

ea4c4032-bc57-4a44-9be2-4aab7d130f62-0
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.120
Like the the veins of the flower
are starting to show.

af30f2e1-d1aa-4294-b270-058492c908c5-0
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.450
Umm.

9fcc6d30-aacb-414e-b8ff-1f2984aee5f2-0
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.670
And it's becoming a A. It's just
that the.

4653ae18-a27c-4b3a-9131-a689a9d36729-0
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.843
Almost like a sketch. A
beautiful sketch of the flower.

4653ae18-a27c-4b3a-9131-a689a9d36729-1
00:16:19.843 --> 00:16:24.776
And so it's made a progression
from a leaf to this flower

4653ae18-a27c-4b3a-9131-a689a9d36729-2
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:29.710
that's. The snow is falling and
beginning to cover it up.

a69e02e4-5623-431d-b0cc-73b1c1cc76aa-0
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.160
Um.

34685d38-eec4-4c88-85b4-67180c76f240-0
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.470
OK, on the page.

4830350a-4faf-4fed-aba3-97b105ec487f-0
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.010
And.

f4fd3218-6e5f-43ab-baa4-ae3c750f38c2-0
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:44.424
After the flower scene, we find
ourselves in a in a futuristic

f4fd3218-6e5f-43ab-baa4-ae3c750f38c2-1
00:16:44.424 --> 00:16:45.150
society.

d189a82d-fb3f-4c88-af2a-b088e7c6565b-0
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.110
With these big.

5634eaba-5dbe-4c0a-8637-c54292196ae1-0
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.510
Buildings and it looks very
industrial. Smokestacks and lots

5634eaba-5dbe-4c0a-8637-c54292196ae1-1
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:59.521
of steam coming out of them and
ships flying through the air

5634eaba-5dbe-4c0a-8637-c54292196ae1-2
00:16:59.521 --> 00:16:59.850
and.

3695ee34-4564-4372-af54-18ac28a5e700-0
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.760
Trees on roofs that look like.

19f676aa-1d9a-442b-917d-41d1e44b5a5f-0
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.370
Pine trees on roofs.

7289b298-4c09-4a72-b9cc-55ead0a43f66-0
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.250
And it's very snowy and it looks
like a cold day.

22fe7bba-42e3-490a-b883-91d034a9b67e-0
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.060
Some people are in the street
and lots of strange.

a55f665c-b367-4645-a135-dcff8c5c2133-0
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.790
Mosquito type animals but
bigger, like a dragon mosquito's

a55f665c-b367-4645-a135-dcff8c5c2133-1
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.110
flying through the air.

30990cff-1f00-444d-9f6d-9d85a3bd76f8-0
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.360
Umm.

ff391b25-b9bd-42aa-8cae-1d27c74255ea-0
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.280
And.

daa9e68e-4f75-446f-b558-4c81b2be540d-0
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.220
It's a very cold place with.

1012f0af-188c-40a2-85e4-cb72a9760bb4-0
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.080
Lots of pointed buildings and
wheels and.

e8560f36-9b8c-4e65-9d11-da694be80ad5-0
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.456
Machines flying in the air and
the colors are mostly black and

e8560f36-9b8c-4e65-9d11-da694be80ad5-1
00:17:50.456 --> 00:17:54.820
white and Gray. There's lots of
snow on the ground.

69a85862-35a8-44e6-a506-2b4f449bce6b-0
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.420
And buildings with big pots on
them and.

af92bb76-fdc4-42ad-bc01-d1f8e262ecf8-0
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.160
Yeah. OK, you can turn the page.

58dbf52c-8de2-4242-bbc2-728960096809-0
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.330
But that's where the man lives.

f24f9e73-9374-4b0b-b55c-335726bafa74-0
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.350
And he is.

e1868ba2-c1f3-4a61-b924-343ee5a71262-0
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.840
Found himself.

ff523178-5bd9-4747-8bfd-81d6d922d708-0
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:22.192
Living in the city that he had
to come to to find a job, it's

ff523178-5bd9-4747-8bfd-81d6d922d708-1
00:18:22.192 --> 00:18:26.889
very different from what he's
used to and he misses his family

ff523178-5bd9-4747-8bfd-81d6d922d708-2
00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:31.661
so much. And so he's sitting on
his bed in his little apartment

ff523178-5bd9-4747-8bfd-81d6d922d708-3
00:18:31.661 --> 00:18:36.284
surrounded by these big pieces
of pottery and his little desk

ff523178-5bd9-4747-8bfd-81d6d922d708-4
00:18:36.284 --> 00:18:40.385
that has this kerosene lamp,
staring at his family and

ff523178-5bd9-4747-8bfd-81d6d922d708-5
00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:42.100
missing them very much.

2959aff1-6356-48cb-8bd1-02325e01d4a2-0
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.380
And then he.

57e6edc0-7bab-4f33-a629-39c6f8ee8517-0
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.610
Outside his window.

95d3f578-4971-4913-b582-8d96f39e8caa-0
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.340
We see this little dragon
mosquito that flew into his.

577c81a0-dd42-4e3d-b2f0-adcf62bc0f19-0
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.260
Pot.

797536c9-49d0-4f48-93c8-b437712b70f1-0
00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.021
It has now laid some eggs and
the babies are hungry and the

797536c9-49d0-4f48-93c8-b437712b70f1-1
00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:04.070
mother is bringing it food and
there are three little birds.

03cb040d-730f-4b34-969e-56727435adb1-0
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.620
Bird mosquito Dragons in this
little pot.

8bbae03b-adad-4b85-957d-78b282687edc-0
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.420
And she's feeding them and.

1fe1a245-8781-4c76-8697-34a6ffa05db7-0
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:18.344
As he's sitting there looking at
his family, he sees her feeding

1fe1a245-8781-4c76-8697-34a6ffa05db7-1
00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:18.640
his.

0548f5b5-7c65-4a04-9c65-9e33544c1033-0
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.100
Her little babies.

92961fa2-3fc1-4663-b684-18469f3bffdd-0
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.620
And.

3b174569-a1fb-4135-916e-256b4ec04cdc-0
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.040
Surrounding him in his room is
his laundry hanging.

5a1e3c28-b605-44b1-a1d9-3537983c0211-0
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.790
In on the lines that he's.

f53c2ce8-be88-47ff-8b09-9804413789d1-0
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.170
Hung in his room, and his shoes
are by his bed.

8347e596-cf96-4280-84da-601ea0946052-0
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.557
And his little pig shark is
sitting on the bed beside him

8347e596-cf96-4280-84da-601ea0946052-1
00:19:39.557 --> 00:19:42.410
with his little tail wrapped
around the man.

402784cb-3b7f-4010-b718-facdb33739e7-0
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.018
And and again, he's sitting
there missing his family as he

402784cb-3b7f-4010-b718-facdb33739e7-1
00:19:47.018 --> 00:19:51.011
looks at their picture, but he
is surrounded by his books, and

402784cb-3b7f-4010-b718-facdb33739e7-2
00:19:51.011 --> 00:19:54.560
so I guess that's what keeps him
busy, aside from work.

bd5c3e20-1a3d-46a4-b402-a0fe99c59f35-0
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.390
And so.

f0bbd223-319d-485e-925b-2fc0d3daa410-0
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.790
The little pig shark suddenly
wakes up.

519ad521-93ad-4d5e-ade4-7dc34af3789b-0
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.020
And hears a noise.

bfb7ada7-3fae-4f11-89a6-10e97c5edffd-0
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.790
And jumps off the bed and and
the man.

1d7b6c79-536e-492e-91a2-353447e76f76-0
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.170
Sees that he.

8336d4c5-d856-4a5f-993c-77f77a4aa01a-0
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.693
Has gone and looks around to see
him going down through the floor

8336d4c5-d856-4a5f-993c-77f77a4aa01a-1
00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:17.740
down a ladder.

a02b2cb5-fd56-43e7-814e-64d32279458b-0
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.630
So the man follows him and.

707d94ff-3725-4014-b694-420ea044c29f-0
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.560
There on the floor is a letter
that came through the door.

1491bcc2-119a-4276-923f-90fa3a9b7a10-0
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.470
And the little pig shark looks
at the man and.

9c85ee4e-aa02-4152-b0bd-0e8f4d331275-0
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.407
Wants him to pick up the letter
and the man opens the letter and

9c85ee4e-aa02-4152-b0bd-0e8f4d331275-1
00:20:34.407 --> 00:20:36.070
his little bird came back.

8a4aeecf-ac70-490a-bfc7-d3ff562a0fec-0
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.570
Umm.

b2f62ccf-2c38-4af2-98a2-b902c9750c42-0
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.977
And he's so happy that he gets
to read his letter and he's

b2f62ccf-2c38-4af2-98a2-b902c9750c42-1
00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:46.760
looking up in the sky to see
where the mail came from.

80efad40-4fa2-43a9-953f-08db89fe6f8a-0
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.840
So he looks out his window.

9fbbe314-aa05-4e0c-b411-46845ab954b5-0
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.590
And that's good. Yeah. We can
turn the page.

9ef83335-260f-4357-9c0f-d3bafebd8e49-0
00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.170
And so the last page is is a
picture of.

64bbef4c-a74a-4627-81be-9be0f31124d3-0
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.274
Various parts of the various
pages and parts of the scene

64bbef4c-a74a-4627-81be-9be0f31124d3-1
00:21:05.274 --> 00:21:10.232
that we just learned about. One
of the pictures is of the little

64bbef4c-a74a-4627-81be-9be0f31124d3-2
00:21:10.232 --> 00:21:13.969
creature that he folded and put
in the envelope.

27d0d20b-7050-446c-9eda-29e41366682f-0
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.380
Another of the pictures is of.

ac07d3ef-2ce9-4889-8474-ee7d7ecfbc73-0
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.820
Probably one of the things that
he did for his work.

5c3c5b28-f982-4c4d-9a0b-33d9263b48b5-0
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.021
And then there's a picture of
his hat and towel on a hook, and

5c3c5b28-f982-4c4d-9a0b-33d9263b48b5-1
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:33.520
a bowl of food that.

2a73262f-8791-445f-9f31-0673dc47dea9-0
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.658
Or plants and vegetables that he
would eat and another picture

2a73262f-8791-445f-9f31-0673dc47dea9-1
00:21:39.658 --> 00:21:39.910
is.

6ab48f62-1960-4c47-ac9c-a74a2e38abae-0
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.770
Of the different kinds of
machines and things that were

6ab48f62-1960-4c47-ac9c-a74a2e38abae-1
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.100
flying in the air with clouds
and smoke coming out of them.

fc9f1c01-5bee-4c2f-affd-c469a90b243f-0
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.540
And the sixth picture, there
there are 9 pictures.

9139fa7f-242f-4a55-b906-fe4a52c996de-0
00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.826
in this big square, 9 different
pictures that form a square. So

9139fa7f-242f-4a55-b906-fe4a52c996de-1
00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:03.530
the the six picture is one of.

8001c2be-7fb5-4f96-a445-f767c9dcbe20-0
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.410
More metal pieces of.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.361
Machinery that might be, looks
like a coffee maker, and that

019067d5-6860-400f-84b5-71f18ad22bb2-1
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:16.128
gives him his coffee and his
newspaper every morning. And

019067d5-6860-400f-84b5-71f18ad22bb2-2
00:22:16.128 --> 00:22:20.090
then there's a picture of him
and his wife and his daughter.

4cb1391e-0d02-431b-b5e6-6ae3f07a6248-0
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.790
And he's having memory of him
giving his daughter.

f6d7cf9d-d1ac-4cec-9828-2d6ef9ba7c18-0
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.970
Some coins to go pick him up
some bread from the store.

22619af8-9c32-4a5a-a0a3-4176f825baad-0
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.170
The end.

f141221f-44a9-44b8-9e1d-c83ddf80a0cd-0
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.302
Family has come to visit him and
the little pig monster's so

f141221f-44a9-44b8-9e1d-c83ddf80a0cd-1
00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:50.075
happy because his daughter is
now here and he can play with

f141221f-44a9-44b8-9e1d-c83ddf80a0cd-2
00:22:50.075 --> 00:22:54.928
her and he's he is handing his
daughter some money to go and

f141221f-44a9-44b8-9e1d-c83ddf80a0cd-3
00:22:54.928 --> 00:22:56.440
get some ice cream.

8c7a1ad4-a088-4616-8734-4baae4de9aaf-0
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.720
And he's and they're having.

33bc3e62-f91e-4735-9ec2-26e5352bc62f-0
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.357
Lunch so this he's telling her
to go get some ice cream for

33bc3e62-f91e-4735-9ec2-26e5352bc62f-1
00:23:04.357 --> 00:23:07.810
dessert and he's surrounded by
all of the.

94383b3f-36bd-4947-ab38-91af75a57d41-0
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.070
Pictures that his little girl
drew for him and.

474bcbb8-e336-4c30-97f1-600813ac7ec6-0
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:22.156
The dishwasher that looks like a
little container, but it

474bcbb8-e336-4c30-97f1-600813ac7ec6-1
00:23:22.156 --> 00:23:24.520
actually can wash his dishes.

76f5e3c5-1b87-4a00-b819-9b29deb3aadf-0
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.566
And the flowers that grew in the
field are now in a vase in his

76f5e3c5-1b87-4a00-b819-9b29deb3aadf-1
00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:35.581
room, and his wife and his
daughter and he are so happy to

76f5e3c5-1b87-4a00-b819-9b29deb3aadf-2
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:38.100
be together and he's telling her
to.

079f7ac8-c550-4b1a-96d8-d43451704fc4-0
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.990
Holding up his hands, he has
three fingers up so.

ae9589c4-1038-4a41-aeba-b79f54005ad0-0
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.312
The little girl knows that she
needs to go and buy 3 ice creams

ae9589c4-1038-4a41-aeba-b79f54005ad0-1
00:23:51.312 --> 00:23:55.538
for herself and her mom and her
dad. So she puts on her boots

ae9589c4-1038-4a41-aeba-b79f54005ad0-2
00:23:55.538 --> 00:23:59.492
because it's still snowing out
and the little pig monster

ae9589c4-1038-4a41-aeba-b79f54005ad0-3
00:23:59.492 --> 00:24:03.786
gives, pig shark gives her her
Hut and she puts it on and they

ae9589c4-1038-4a41-aeba-b79f54005ad0-4
00:24:03.786 --> 00:24:05.900
run outside together to go and.

2ee30c18-6e3b-43ce-a5f5-ae69188f3f9c-0
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.560
get

a5d9de31-0746-49e4-b75f-2cacca023fac-0
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.455
The ice cream. But as the
running down the steps and

a5d9de31-0746-49e4-b75f-2cacca023fac-1
00:24:12.455 --> 00:24:16.593
through the streets, they come
across these beautiful lights

a5d9de31-0746-49e4-b75f-2cacca023fac-2
00:24:16.593 --> 00:24:20.596
laying in the street and she
points to them and picks them

a5d9de31-0746-49e4-b75f-2cacca023fac-3
00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:20.800
up.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.050
One by one and they float and
they light up and float up into

b156e42e-bc14-472b-bd4d-3c72690414ea-1
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.260
the air. #END_arrival_6

Turn, please.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:32.670
Yeah.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.020
And let me see what's next.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.380
The next is another short story.

fa6bef32-df20-48d4-9734-0343cc164291-0
00:24:50.170 --> 00:25:04.420

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.770
Do you want me to start? OK.

a4269404-4225-41fe-8d90-bd878d4be39e-0
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.850
#START_arrival_5 Once Upon a
time, there was.

c59ad632-93ba-4f14-83be-f7eaa91430fa-0
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.170
A city.

9281161d-4678-4e4a-92e0-899f43eba4df-0
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.365
In a faraway land that was like
no other city that you've ever

9281161d-4678-4e4a-92e0-899f43eba4df-1
00:25:28.365 --> 00:25:28.690
seen.

6d60230d-9e60-46d9-9a6c-244c899d6327-0
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.810
The people in this city loved
owls, and owls and other birds

6d60230d-9e60-46d9-9a6c-244c899d6327-1
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.752
were everywhere. They were. They
were made of clay and they sat

6d60230d-9e60-46d9-9a6c-244c899d6327-2
00:25:39.752 --> 00:25:43.149
on top of the buildings and they
were huge.

4256e27f-565e-4f2e-9352-1840b2f4a5bc-0
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.450
And the owls that were sitting
on the buildings.

5c355807-ff87-4c22-93a8-a72f9f4863e9-0
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:47.860
Had

5587148f-eafa-4a56-8fe8-180cf9d8ac14-0
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.800
Open heads that the birds and
owls other owls would.

6bae9469-45d4-4972-b55b-ef2a450b0eb5-0
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.270
Live in.

61a0a160-5e85-47b8-a9eb-fca4690351ab-0
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.600
And they this.

b1240b61-a926-4bc2-92e2-7e9dc1369f7d-0
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.699
This little city was on an
island, and the only way you

b1240b61-a926-4bc2-92e2-7e9dc1369f7d-1
00:26:01.699 --> 00:26:04.630
could get to this island was by
boat.

4cf591e7-73c8-4c3f-b9c2-e12c442a3ac5-0
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.300
And.

e524ba8b-d784-4997-9180-d930db0efc39-0
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.785
As you came up from the water,
there was a landing where you

e524ba8b-d784-4997-9180-d930db0efc39-1
00:26:11.785 --> 00:26:16.138
could put your boat. After you
landed, you would carry your

e524ba8b-d784-4997-9180-d930db0efc39-2
00:26:16.138 --> 00:26:17.590
boat up to the walk.

256cc146-450c-4c26-90d4-1a9abf5ede05-0
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.740
And so there were boats for
many.

53d7533b-8ed7-4460-a5de-c55f9ec1142b-0
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.493
People who lived in the city and
they just loved their bird and

53d7533b-8ed7-4460-a5de-c55f9ec1142b-1
00:26:30.493 --> 00:26:35.360
especially the owls that sat on
top of their buildings, these

53d7533b-8ed7-4460-a5de-c55f9ec1142b-2
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.480
big, big concrete owls and.

11347c55-ad7b-4bc3-95ad-5d8708a7cc99-0
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.460
So the people that lived in this
city.

f477b272-12a4-4143-b8bf-aff794743cbb-0
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.430
Had a very unusual life, they.

6bc6592e-c1a1-492e-aff3-2c4aee5e0450-0
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.580
Umm.

1e69062f-415c-427f-b5b6-ebfdc3fc1071-0
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.330
They.

8095f009-1e23-4588-81cd-6adc5382b6d1-0
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.750
Made fantastic.

9d72dd28-0926-4ab2-b5cd-fae684b726e6-0
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:08.262
fantastical images, so unusual.
Their cats were a cone with a

9d72dd28-0926-4ab2-b5cd-fae684b726e6-1
00:27:08.262 --> 00:27:14.355
cat head on it, and their pets
were little pigs that had long

9d72dd28-0926-4ab2-b5cd-fae684b726e6-2
00:27:14.355 --> 00:27:17.500
tails that look like sharks and.

2f5f2711-40ec-4e24-a83c-0907c9ad04c7-0
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.690
One family owned a cat.

2b63840e-bd0a-4a05-8cd9-f068e1d6e677-0
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.550
That they would take out for a
walk and.

d13f9995-41b6-4e97-b25b-fa611707cf03-0
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.900
As.

1cf6863f-c0f1-4a81-989a-aa35ebbadd65-0
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.060
Dad decided one day to send his.

8f0f29e5-afd6-4bcc-ae40-05012902a425-0
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:39.138
Or the mom decided one day to
send her son to take some gifts

8f0f29e5-afd6-4bcc-ae40-05012902a425-1
00:27:39.138 --> 00:27:42.890
to a friend, and so she handed
him a bowl.

869c691c-c80c-4249-98f5-968799383b9e-0
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:51.855
Of food and told him to take
this food to a friend of theirs.

869c691c-c80c-4249-98f5-968799383b9e-1
00:27:51.855 --> 00:27:54.760
And so he he left and.

ab18cec7-1c11-4fd5-9c91-b23ba9241df9-0
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.360
So did the dad.

809ff26a-08dd-4aec-b6a3-e45cfffd44a3-0
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.170
And they all went.

9c12585f-3a1b-466d-8739-0fb6ded0751f-0
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:08.050
To visit this other family, but
as the little boy left.

d44b185b-48c4-459e-8172-4e4ff705c229-0
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.180
Another man came to visit his
mom and.

592f3b9e-22c6-4ce3-8a13-8c9e21f30d93-0
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.807
Dad and they shared a drink
together and they were going to

592f3b9e-22c6-4ce3-8a13-8c9e21f30d93-1
00:28:18.807 --> 00:28:24.147
have some squid for lunch and so
the mom cut up the squid and

592f3b9e-22c6-4ce3-8a13-8c9e21f30d93-2
00:28:24.147 --> 00:28:27.420
cooked it in this little
interesting.

166750db-7b98-43ec-9d60-f3e33ae91863-0
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.750
Oven and.

3d4ec522-26b9-45e1-bba4-862419b070d1-0
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.480
Seasoned it with butter, melted
butter and we can turn the page.

264c5225-b051-4211-b765-7d9780525520-0
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.450
And they all enjoyed.

4ef04834-4032-4c62-b9e0-8d4eee644cc0-0
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.230
Their meal.

86a3a8fc-b930-403c-ab38-ee2ce3aa8702-0
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.630
Of wild seafood.

2dcf4236-af00-4c21-b44c-98a7497c4d81-0
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:57.780
That.

2097896b-1325-4102-842d-5ba439aeab50-0
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:06.646
And the way that they cook their
seafood was they had a a fire

2097896b-1325-4102-842d-5ba439aeab50-1
00:29:06.646 --> 00:29:07.620
extinguisher.

988413fe-9621-48b3-9b20-78762efdc529-0
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:15.353
extinguisher that shot out fire
tongs and shoot the fire at it

988413fe-9621-48b3-9b20-78762efdc529-1
00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:20.623
and that would cook it so that
they could eat it. And the

988413fe-9621-48b3-9b20-78762efdc529-2
00:29:20.623 --> 00:29:26.256
little boy loved to feed his
shark pig pet and his little cat

988413fe-9621-48b3-9b20-78762efdc529-3
00:29:26.256 --> 00:29:26.620
pet.

6699c1ec-cb3b-41ff-9acd-215e372bad7c-0
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.610
That they love this seafood
also, so they.

e579b709-b8be-45c9-a303-ae4c7eb3c7de-0
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.925
Enjoy taking scraps from the
table that the little boy fed

00:29:35.925 --> 00:29:40.313
him while his dad and his mom
talked and his the guest cooked

e579b709-b8be-45c9-a303-ae4c7eb3c7de-2
00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:44.701
the food. So they had a good
time, a good meal, they had some

e579b709-b8be-45c9-a303-ae4c7eb3c7de-3
00:29:44.701 --> 00:29:49.160
wine and they ate their seafood,
and then they decided that it

e579b709-b8be-45c9-a303-ae4c7eb3c7de-4
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.770
was time to play some music, so
they got out their

86554b4b-ad5b-44dd-9b9f-dea059e1933c-0
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.960
Crazy. Crazy.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.683
Instruments and played the
little horn along with the

aa8efba4-f5e1-4d75-9a28-90a140657c32-1
00:30:05.683 --> 00:30:10.618
accordion that had horns coming
from it and a little banjo, and

aa8efba4-f5e1-4d75-9a28-90a140657c32-2
00:30:10.618 --> 00:30:11.390
they made.

0669304b-2883-42bd-b3bb-17272e3bea86-0
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:18.205
I can't think of the Japanese
where they folded the papers and

0669304b-2883-42bd-b3bb-17272e3bea86-1
00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:18.540
made.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.210
Cool designs with their paper
folding.

e83d0bff-03c2-456f-99cb-16160f917303-0
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.406
And the man made-up made a
folding of the cat, the little

e83d0bff-03c2-456f-99cb-16160f917303-1
00:30:28.406 --> 00:30:29.180
boy's cat.

aa6a04ff-e48c-4712-8318-620bbec8fc9d-0
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.300
Which he gave to the little boy
as a gift. 

5bb6fbd0-b429-47e8-9af7-1bd85ed76289-0
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.720
And.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.597
The mom and the dad, as he was
leaving, pulled out a bowl and

260c64f6-cb31-44d5-aa6c-f9d8e2f969ce-1
00:30:40.597 --> 00:30:43.460
were handing the bowl. You can
turn the page.

30549303-c507-4092-aa19-80f1b48636ae-0
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.520
Pulled out a bowl.

b9ae752d-db01-4ca2-8a53-4e77e30d9aab-0
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.500
And handed the man.

31626500-edc6-4dc3-a3fa-74de418ae9be-0
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.190
The same bowl that the that the
birds.

c7978957-b1b4-449a-8f76-e3e8a03d2e6a-0
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.920


61c8d926-6521-433f-8ccf-15c2d6ff702a-0
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.792
That the bird had her family in,
but it was empty because the

61c8d926-6521-433f-8ccf-15c2d6ff702a-1
00:31:05.792 --> 00:31:09.345
birds had flown away, and now
the man had brought the bowl in

61c8d926-6521-433f-8ccf-15c2d6ff702a-2
00:31:09.345 --> 00:31:13.013
and he gave it to their friends,
who took it home and put it on

61c8d926-6521-433f-8ccf-15c2d6ff702a-3
00:31:13.013 --> 00:31:13.929
his window sill.

193f3fec-ef70-4438-9cfb-4572a01bd90c-0
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:20.230
And he also had a pig shark pet.

93317ff7-f14b-4f64-8105-b4c457b7c9ad-0
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.050
And who he loved to have sleep
by him.

ca73c7be-6ed5-4039-85ab-56ca7f80a31d-0
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.529
And so he went to sleep after
his wonderful meal with his

ca73c7be-6ed5-4039-85ab-56ca7f80a31d-1
00:31:31.529 --> 00:31:31.980
friends.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.290
But then when he woke up, he got
ready and.

a58ebdd9-79a6-4070-8aff-40e47094a821-0
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.370
Got ready, ate his breakfast and
fed his little pig shark and.

b301aff6-b26d-40ca-876b-eda74ef17e27-0
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.650
Got his jacket on and that his
little pet handed him his hat.

83c985a8-a80e-4a38-8962-8e3375300323-0
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.690
Change, Turn the ship, turn the
page.

42bddfca-2234-4afd-9e2b-b160272a29d3-0
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.720
And off to work he went.

d3511777-3710-4cc5-af8d-3dbd250aa5eb-0
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.120
With all.

eedfde9e-e1ac-4eeb-8e4a-01fe8e42412a-0
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.656
All the hundreds of other people
heading to work, but it was an

eedfde9e-e1ac-4eeb-8e4a-01fe8e42412a-1
00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.853
interesting society because as I
said, they love their pets and

eedfde9e-e1ac-4eeb-8e4a-01fe8e42412a-2
00:32:07.853 --> 00:32:10.900
they love their birds and so
everybody brought their pets to

eedfde9e-e1ac-4eeb-8e4a-01fe8e42412a-3
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.150
work.

e3331809-7f14-4715-9087-d2ce0d057cd8-0
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.070
And.

a1ea0c3f-4e0a-4e35-8857-1c5c7844407e-0
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.580
A very creative they love to
take care of everything around

a1ea0c3f-4e0a-4e35-8857-1c5c7844407e-1
00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.090
them and.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.440
They did many different jobs,
some, some.

1876f3e4-37bb-47f8-8532-52d7def8b0df-0
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.290
People clean the sidewalks.

db98aed0-9aa0-45a0-9336-fc8aa68ca727-0
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.140
Some people.

8633a246-c686-41f2-94ce-19b792324fda-0
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.620
Cooked and fed the animals.

ea06cd1a-1317-40df-9394-89d07ad58ccf-0
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.750
Some people sold their.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.167
Sold food to the people that
lived in the city. Some people

1ef70249-4b98-4212-8c9f-cb0317df3eea-1
00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:51.120
created art and dishes and.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:01.072
And so the man walked through
the city and and enjoyed all the

be292a71-b5eb-4f51-b2b8-43a54b6bde4e-1
00:33:01.072 --> 00:33:04.040
views of the different people
doing different things.

And.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:07.790
It looks like he was.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.950
Look, walking through the city
asking for people to wear.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.500
Could they tell him where his
birds went?

fbde4196-cfda-4776-b8aa-f04e2ef33b48-0
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.377
And he stopped at the the the
bakery and they said no we we

00:33:22.377 --> 00:33:27.130
didn't see them here and he
stopped at the at the pottery

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.321
They said no, we didn't see them
here. We don't have what you're

1e55123c-3095-41b6-8ab4-79cd7d8293bf-1
00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:32.990
looking for.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:35.410
And so he.

0c58e14d-591f-4671-8817-08e6d91dd998-0
00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.470
Wasn't able to find what he was
looking for.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:46.411
And the the pilots of all of the
the planes or the the ships that

0f9545ff-f063-4959-9c3c-84185b3824b5-1
00:33:46.411 --> 00:33:47.770
flew in the sky.

If not, we could keep going.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:40.419
Instead of real Buffalo or yeah,
steer coming down the street,

a1c46270-8798-49df-8422-e38771f2acab-1
00:36:40.419 --> 00:36:42.570
coming down the dusty.

52a6c4d6-296a-44ac-aaa0-d1e210d10033-0
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:49.012
Road. There are stamps of them.
Maybe it's supposed to say that,

52a6c4d6-296a-44ac-aaa0-d1e210d10033-1
00:36:49.012 --> 00:36:51.800
pretend it's like a Stampede of.

31141261-233b-4075-9e8a-021e1178be11-0
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.750
Buffalo.

24b0dd2f-cc21-45ab-bd6a-3de9cac4c889-0
00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:00.330
Walking down the Main Street of
this little Wild West town.

16c40612-5aaf-4058-9477-3cb5503313e6-0
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.435
And another part of the scene is
the entrance to gold mines where

16c40612-5aaf-4058-9477-3cb5503313e6-1
00:37:06.435 --> 00:37:11.242
you have more people coming and
going in one place, the miners

16c40612-5aaf-4058-9477-3cb5503313e6-2
00:37:11.242 --> 00:37:16.125
are going into the gold mine and
and and and another right next

16c40612-5aaf-4058-9477-3cb5503313e6-3
00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:20.932
door, they're coming out of the
gold mine as they finish their

16c40612-5aaf-4058-9477-3cb5503313e6-4
00:37:20.932 --> 00:37:21.390
shift.

43f4cb26-de68-4853-b37b-92af55c15d76-0
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.170
And there are there are two
scenes. One has.

267d853a-9e43-4258-8ace-a5bc14b96d3b-0
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.776
One, there are actually two
roads, and on each road, they

267d853a-9e43-4258-8ace-a5bc14b96d3b-1
00:37:32.776 --> 00:37:34.000
have the exact same

0348f9eb-2d2e-43bb-9d60-f7bc153545f0-0
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.270
Umm.

46ca6599-ed29-493b-ab86-a0b7dd01c410-0
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.860
Set up where they have a saloon
and a hotel.

4044420f-fd7f-4e47-bfa3-e62dcdb7c880-0
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.230
One is the last saloon and the
other is the Wild West saloon.

fe791234-e3a6-4cdf-9105-1a0dc7bf4c38-0
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.123
So it's and there's horses in
there and there are ladies with

fe791234-e3a6-4cdf-9105-1a0dc7bf4c38-1
00:37:52.123 --> 00:37:55.540
their gentlemen. There are crazy
Cowboys.

64863aa0-9bd7-43ff-99e0-0913f8b56411-0
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.580
There are people falling off
roofs and.

5cf8e959-205c-4a17-b5a5-5e796f6c0781-0
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:06.948
Yeah. And so that's on the left
side of the page. Oh, I see some

5cf8e959-205c-4a17-b5a5-5e796f6c0781-1
00:38:06.948 --> 00:38:11.213
covered wagons there. Other
things that you would see in a

5cf8e959-205c-4a17-b5a5-5e796f6c0781-2
00:38:11.213 --> 00:38:13.310
in a typical Wild West scene.

f65cc2a7-95fa-4bc1-b145-1e3b38d86e40-0
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:21.370
And then on the next page it's
very similar but the.

d175fc4c-6d73-48c4-9653-def5b28190c0-0
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:26.540
The setup is that it the the
city, the town goes.

e5ec2b27-a770-4e33-b7d1-1c2d62afac7e-0
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.745
It's the vertical, not
horizontal, so it's on top of

e5ec2b27-a770-4e33-b7d1-1c2d62afac7e-1
00:38:31.745 --> 00:38:36.793
each other. You have this, this,
this scene in the road where

e5ec2b27-a770-4e33-b7d1-1c2d62afac7e-2
00:38:36.793 --> 00:38:41.271
there's a new. The train is
coming into this, into the

e5ec2b27-a770-4e33-b7d1-1c2d62afac7e-3
00:38:41.271 --> 00:38:41.760
depot.

a98a46b4-c595-41ad-9783-7d52e9ce92d6-0
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.660
So people are standing there
waiting.

2173974b-7817-4a84-a71b-f6c6b79e0834-0
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.717
But you also see the inside of
the saloon, where there's

2173974b-7817-4a84-a71b-f6c6b79e0834-1
00:38:50.717 --> 00:38:51.770
fighting and.

93d446dd-1de5-4b5d-9977-d40f18b05e74-0
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.900
Cowboys are falling over the
banisters and.

f938ca90-6b58-46e9-ae34-3f1f567b12ea-0
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.964
You see them up on the roof,
climbing on the roof and having

f938ca90-6b58-46e9-ae34-3f1f567b12ea-1
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:01.760
a good time.

9eb9d8ca-8170-4840-abf8-26797ea622b3-0
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.677
Looks like they may even be
robbing a bank and they've got

9eb9d8ca-8170-4840-abf8-26797ea622b3-1
00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:08.780
bags of money in their hands.

f2924428-babd-4231-9140-c2d8b8aa8228-0
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.230
Umm.

89609ca2-4e7d-4ec9-879a-9adefe9a7086-0
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.870
And so the bank is on top of the
saloon.

b5a8adfc-2e93-40ec-88e4-037c133729e7-0
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.960
One of the saloons and.

d87de783-539b-4d3a-b253-514ee9c68bbb-0
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.595
There are a couple saloons
beside the bank where there are

d87de783-539b-4d3a-b253-514ee9c68bbb-1
00:39:23.595 --> 00:39:25.220
they put a big cannon.

d09c38af-3239-48d3-adcb-2a3932985b6d-0
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:27.830
Umm.

708e1f98-b69f-4558-885d-57fae29bb7a2-0
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.854
And then behind that or I guess
it's either behind or on top, I

708e1f98-b69f-4558-885d-57fae29bb7a2-1
00:39:35.854 --> 00:39:40.250
can't tell, is another road
where they are.

3cb76549-eb2d-43d2-8081-8c24c809a920-0
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.710
Climbing some ladders and
there's a blacksmith there.

65a66990-137a-452d-b826-fbe8e8864071-0
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.380


8f79f9f7-a5b1-45bb-8987-9195346c7c2e-0
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.560
Doing horseshoes, making
horseshoes for a horse.

847280bb-3e0e-477d-9f8d-6f6aa33b9022-0
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.370
And.

8ee7c0f0-eceb-4407-bfe5-bc2a4fbde86b-0
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.630
A couple more saloons.

cc82d1f2-9b8c-42bf-ae01-757177e9a791-0
00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:02.140
And then there's a big picture
of a desert with some.

0543995e-a398-41c5-a0b4-787e93d93db5-0
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.790
Cactus in it and.

60194d92-a52d-482b-a7ce-f37cc5edf831-0
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.437
One of the Cowboys is riding his
horse through the picture into

60194d92-a52d-482b-a7ce-f37cc5edf831-1
00:40:10.437 --> 00:40:12.820
and riding off into the sunset.

5e503b9f-7fab-46f4-95e6-e6d55e094a48-0
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.470
And people are watching him do
that.

4d29cee0-912a-4e7c-84aa-ca2926c95810-0
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:16.790
Umm.

5ff49d48-3188-42a0-92b6-83c20e9822e3-0
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.410
So Yep, it's a big Western
scene, old wild Wild West. And

5ff49d48-3188-42a0-92b6-83c20e9822e3-1
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.320
it's pretty wild. #END_wild_west

3fae2e2f-5ba0-4ae4-b9ac-13bcb48f58b0-0
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.500
Let me see what we have next.

8d34c507-bad7-4545-8e8a-03fc3cda70f3-0
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.220
OK, NEXT is another short story.

7eae8f95-7e9a-486c-a52e-e5795641fbe5-0
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.408
#START_arrival_4 So we left off
with the man looking and

7eae8f95-7e9a-486c-a52e-e5795641fbe5-1
00:41:19.408 --> 00:41:20.110
searching for.

6d97bbd2-456d-40d1-98f1-08022598f80a-0
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:28.877
The thing he had lost, but he
was able to make his way home

6d97bbd2-456d-40d1-98f1-08022598f80a-1
00:41:28.877 --> 00:41:34.445
and after being spending the day
walking around the city, the

6d97bbd2-456d-40d1-98f1-08022598f80a-2
00:41:34.445 --> 00:41:39.743
Dark City where all kinds of
industrial smoke and dirt had

6d97bbd2-456d-40d1-98f1-08022598f80a-3
00:41:39.743 --> 00:41:45.131
been, he decided to take a
shower. And so he took a shower.

6d97bbd2-456d-40d1-98f1-08022598f80a-4
00:41:45.131 --> 00:41:45.759
And he.

36293a00-e900-4bcc-8f94-463f60103e89-0
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:51.546
Gave himself a shave and he
decided that he was going to go

36293a00-e900-4bcc-8f94-463f60103e89-1
00:41:51.546 --> 00:41:56.897
out again and make his way out
into the city and try to search

36293a00-e900-4bcc-8f94-463f60103e89-2
00:41:56.897 --> 00:42:02.249
for the thing that he had lost
or was looking for again. So he

36293a00-e900-4bcc-8f94-463f60103e89-3
00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:07.515
took a shower, shaved, got on
his clothes, buttoned his vest,

36293a00-e900-4bcc-8f94-463f60103e89-4
00:42:07.515 --> 00:42:08.789
tied his shoes.

cee8f25b-189a-46c3-ac9a-c606fe3cf22c-0
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.740
Made sure he had enough money.

19c2f1fd-c1db-42c0-9bba-9cd7eefef6cb-0
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.560
Um for transits. And then he put
on his hat and.

48d40df0-60ae-4cbe-b226-bb9df22b546a-0
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.374
Pulled up the map out of his
pocket and wanted to make sure

48d40df0-60ae-4cbe-b226-bb9df22b546a-1
00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:21.700
he knew where he was going.

f2135d22-3ec7-4dd7-98ef-276f02049971-0
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.590
And he made sure that his little
pig shark was with him because.

a9a3c0c8-d5a0-4e0c-a0c3-f6a731d0c8a1-0
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.206
They were friends and they went
everywhere together. So as he

a9a3c0c8-d5a0-4e0c-a0c3-f6a731d0c8a1-1
00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:34.675
stood looking at his map, his
pig shark was sitting by his

a9a3c0c8-d5a0-4e0c-a0c3-f6a731d0c8a1-2
00:42:34.675 --> 00:42:34.970
feet.

a0945361-beb7-46bd-9c06-7f9ef1f6a0be-0
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:40.156
And then they decided to go off
into the city and they walked a

a0945361-beb7-46bd-9c06-7f9ef1f6a0be-1
00:42:40.156 --> 00:42:41.640
long way into the city.

78425fe1-9dcb-4b58-b451-b166ce96be59-0
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:44.220
And.

fae502e8-6eb7-434a-9b42-c74df047e740-0
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.592
He kept looking at the map
because he just for some reason

fae502e8-6eb7-434a-9b42-c74df047e740-1
00:42:49.592 --> 00:42:50.930
he couldn't understand.

3770caa3-9c99-41b6-8e0c-7d949f4768cf-0
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.811
Which direction he was supposed
to be going, and he couldn't

3770caa3-9c99-41b6-8e0c-7d949f4768cf-1
00:42:56.811 --> 00:43:01.150
really figure out where the
place was that he needed to be.

be910c3f-b49c-486d-a2cd-fe55f710b721-0
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:02.780
Um.

c4ceb08a-0f01-4407-81f9-675a8e47c925-0
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.719
So he found his way to the
subway station in the train

c4ceb08a-0f01-4407-81f9-675a8e47c925-1
00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:08.310
station.

81711546-5f93-4019-9119-261b0e933cb9-0
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.845
And as he was standing there, if
you look around, he's, the train

81711546-5f93-4019-9119-261b0e933cb9-1
00:43:14.845 --> 00:43:19.280
station was under this huge
bridge with big arches and.

64435c90-3334-4d3f-9afd-6c2bb9937f30-0
00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:25.750
Flying through those arches were
big ships that would normally.

52af02fb-67c2-410f-9678-a9846bf81922-0
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:31.830
Be in the water, but these were
flying through the air and big

52af02fb-67c2-410f-9678-a9846bf81922-1
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:36.595
cones of metal that were
standing on the train platform

52af02fb-67c2-410f-9678-a9846bf81922-2
00:43:36.595 --> 00:43:40.510
and people were wandering around
and lots of.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:47.652
Those prehistoric birds that
would were flying probably also

8ebbf8bc-2c23-4719-bf24-d21f0c6ae408-1
00:43:47.652 --> 00:43:49.080
made of metal.

dea2e093-85c3-46c2-9117-59364615ed39-0
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.790
And this was all happening. Lots
of animals wandering around,

dea2e093-85c3-46c2-9117-59364615ed39-1
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:58.000
strange looking animals that
had.

c3c60649-1124-4451-9926-37d06552bfee-0
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.890
Had tails and.

eda35c6e-30e5-4ddd-a1ea-e8d6789b8a54-0
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.850
Triangular faces and.

d871afd9-1577-436f-b6fb-62ee32d4a66e-0
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.480
But he didn't seem to notice
them because he was looking at

d871afd9-1577-436f-b6fb-62ee32d4a66e-1
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:08.880
his map.

e90c581a-d0fd-481e-b08d-8a34eb0cadf1-0
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.850
We can turn the page.

1c755b46-bb61-466f-86c2-2acffc644c6f-0
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.489
But there was one thing that he
did suddenly notice, and that

1c755b46-bb61-466f-86c2-2acffc644c6f-1
00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:28.320
was when his little pink shark
met a little.

c142e27f-deee-4e7c-97d7-86b240cdc641-0
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.740
Strange bird.

c35f1244-908e-4835-9f07-b361b9495c6e-0
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.040
That looks like it had two.

f6798b45-7067-4781-b237-7aee22182881-0
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.060
Peaks on its ears. It looks like
an owl.

89555de6-ee90-47e8-976c-125cbfad2935-0
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.100
Umm but.

a86b822d-f26c-4d9b-8424-7d2e037ba954-0
00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.750
It's hard to describe.

67b80b2e-115e-4818-b00a-0407c09ee8ef-0
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.840
Except that it had these two.

23a634b0-7258-4342-a992-ede4df0571a0-0
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.285
Big pointed ears that were about
the same size of his body.

23a634b0-7258-4342-a992-ede4df0571a0-1
00:44:52.285 --> 00:44:57.022
Anyway, his little pet pig shark
started, started talking to this

23a634b0-7258-4342-a992-ede4df0571a0-2
00:44:57.022 --> 00:45:01.400
bird, and then he noticed that
the bird belonged to a woman.

c994b037-7c26-4572-a713-e09be88f624b-0
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.618
And he started talking to the
woman. He asked her, do you know

c994b037-7c26-4572-a713-e09be88f624b-1
00:45:05.618 --> 00:45:08.738
where this place is? He was
looking for directions, so he

c994b037-7c26-4572-a713-e09be88f624b-2
00:45:08.738 --> 00:45:09.760
showed her his map.

96723607-49e2-46a6-90b9-209d05236e29-0
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.040
And.

8cf72587-5aa2-4c37-af70-9bc208227338-0
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:17.894
She was able to locate what it
was he was asking about and she

8cf72587-5aa2-4c37-af70-9bc208227338-1
00:45:17.894 --> 00:45:18.770
showed him.

4d018fd6-5250-4612-ab94-e791a16a97fb-0
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.396
That she could, he could
actually call and ask someone

4d018fd6-5250-4612-ab94-e791a16a97fb-1
00:45:25.396 --> 00:45:30.066
about it. So she took him over
to the phone, the payphone, and

4d018fd6-5250-4612-ab94-e791a16a97fb-2
00:45:30.066 --> 00:45:31.920
showed him how to use it.

b84ae620-b6aa-4124-aa96-73e018bc49ed-0
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:38.127
But then what he realized is it
wasn't a pay phone. It was

b84ae620-b6aa-4124-aa96-73e018bc49ed-1
00:45:38.127 --> 00:45:42.157
actually where he could get a
ticket to take his to to catch

b84ae620-b6aa-4124-aa96-73e018bc49ed-2
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:45.460
one of the boats that was flying
through the air.

d8858f75-7713-4530-a44b-323e13450bd6-0
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.199
Because he wasn't really sure
how to do that. He knew that he

d8858f75-7713-4530-a44b-323e13450bd6-1
00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:52.610
was at the right place, but he
needed to.

3ef60737-e746-4c19-b21e-3b705ed01ec3-0
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:58.195
Get the ticket to take him where
he needed to go so she was able

3ef60737-e746-4c19-b21e-3b705ed01ec3-1
00:45:58.195 --> 00:46:01.420
to help him and she got his
ticket for him and.

aedb40b8-a728-4693-b6be-ecaaa43ceaf6-0
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.460
With the other passengers on
the.

40fe47ca-123e-4ceb-8e97-8b445e7ba411-0
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.140


781f9783-36b6-45be-9335-2b418ac709c7-0
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:16.400
Station waiting for his boat to
come, and as he watched, a large

81d3c8b9-f30d-43ef-84b2-3e59b0b4cc5e-0
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:23.003
ship headed towards the crowd
and as they stood there, it came

81d3c8b9-f30d-43ef-84b2-3e59b0b4cc5e-1
00:46:23.003 --> 00:46:25.620
lower and lower and it landed.

e5a538de-6d1e-4c95-891d-1bf7da71e3c1-0
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:32.513
And it resembled one of those
steamboats that that you can see

e5a538de-6d1e-4c95-891d-1bf7da71e3c1-1
00:46:32.513 --> 00:46:36.547
running up and down the
Mississippi River with the

e5a538de-6d1e-4c95-891d-1bf7da71e3c1-2
00:46:36.547 --> 00:46:41.451
smokestacks and the the steam
wheels. And the wheels actually

e5a538de-6d1e-4c95-891d-1bf7da71e3c1-3
00:46:41.451 --> 00:46:44.219
look like the little flowers
that.

0f61bf1f-03e5-499b-a360-ec0f6281b02b-0
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.674
He saw when he was visiting his
family that he had dinner with

0f61bf1f-03e5-499b-a360-ec0f6281b02b-1
00:46:49.674 --> 00:46:52.900
the other night, so he and his
little pig shark

f3352261-79b8-4e64-8af7-924e3bae58d2-0
00:46:54.070 --> 00:47:00.787
Walk with the crowd to get on
the boat. The The the sky boat

f3352261-79b8-4e64-8af7-924e3bae58d2-1
00:47:00.787 --> 00:47:03.100
and the ticket taker.

3e38b558-3969-4f48-8100-3a770e5837d5-0
00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.130
Takes his ticket and stamps it.

1597b867-732a-4983-bf30-f672506b4107-0
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.780
And shows him.

55981911-fe75-47c4-8eb9-7e3f7dd7bd83-0
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.960
Where he should walk to get onto
the boat.

479657a6-e023-4d1a-9ec9-1eed4049883e-0
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:15.540
Next page.

3d360eb8-954f-483f-ab13-d5a7fcc1200f-0
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.326
The man, even though the boats
crowded, he finds a seat and he

3d360eb8-954f-483f-ab13-d5a7fcc1200f-1
00:47:23.326 --> 00:47:28.173
and his pet pig shark sit next
to the woman who helped him get

3d360eb8-954f-483f-ab13-d5a7fcc1200f-2
00:47:28.173 --> 00:47:32.943
the tickets. And they sit, and
they have a nice conversation,

3d360eb8-954f-483f-ab13-d5a7fcc1200f-3
00:47:32.943 --> 00:47:37.790
but he looks like he's confused
and he's still trying to find.

daa0cf92-5b11-4c2e-b054-4aba82c33d81-0
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:39.030
You know.

3a22c316-b0f7-47c0-a6fa-ea1f48687ec8-0
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.711
Trying to figure out where he
can find what he's looking for.

3a22c316-b0f7-47c0-a6fa-ea1f48687ec8-1
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:49.480
So he's talks to the woman and
he says, you know, I think.

15501ac9-b89a-4b3b-ac2f-99326007918d-0
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.854
Maybe you can help me. You were
so kind to help me get the

15501ac9-b89a-4b3b-ac2f-99326007918d-1
00:47:54.854 --> 00:47:58.779
ticket. Maybe you can help me
find this person that I'm

15501ac9-b89a-4b3b-ac2f-99326007918d-2
00:47:58.779 --> 00:48:03.264
looking for. And so he pulls a
picture, a piece of paper out of

15501ac9-b89a-4b3b-ac2f-99326007918d-3
00:48:03.264 --> 00:48:07.189
his pocket, and he holds up a
piece of paper that has a

15501ac9-b89a-4b3b-ac2f-99326007918d-4
00:48:07.189 --> 00:48:07.959
picture of.

4e79056f-9fbf-4cca-a7d5-72751fad5b34-0
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.150
A young girl on it and he shows
the woman.

d39c118c-2d2b-442a-905e-d4770c74fb6c-0
00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:13.460
Umm.

fc734bdc-28e0-430a-b08e-4c84e28ee389-0
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.970
The picture, and she looks at it
and she puts her hand to her.

5d154e32-492c-4214-bf6d-10fedf2b1661-0
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:25.239
To her throat and she's
surprised and she reaches into

5d154e32-492c-4214-bf6d-10fedf2b1661-1
00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:30.748
her bag and she pulls out a
picture and her picture is of a

5d154e32-492c-4214-bf6d-10fedf2b1661-2
00:48:30.748 --> 00:48:31.850
little girl.

3c76c625-02df-4ed2-83a1-609298446555-0
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.770
But his picture is of a little
boy.

08f23e17-9a70-4695-8491-28676274a4b1-0
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.647
But for some reason they think
that they have something in

08f23e17-9a70-4695-8491-28676274a4b1-1
00:48:39.647 --> 00:48:40.020
common.

f44febbb-6378-48a4-a593-1353b5fbb4d5-0
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.980
And so they go back. So this
little.

35f7a004-d39e-4045-a666-67101c0f10e5-0
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.340
This little girl that.

5f896a53-e260-4fa4-9337-41ccec2767ea-0
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.390
Is in the on the paper of the
woman has a story.

4ba077ad-ccf0-4bde-8c26-d74635f6feb7-0
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:56.340
And her story is that she.

b6f60e8d-1feb-4666-92d8-d47a3b134c39-0
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.230
Loved to read and.

0f62c1cb-2dda-456d-bb40-23d676294593-0
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.024
One day when she was reading,
someone took her book from her

0f62c1cb-2dda-456d-bb40-23d676294593-1
00:49:05.024 --> 00:49:06.070
and put it away.

311d2fbe-9284-467f-b577-fb24abc68309-0
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.660
And locked it up and made her.

9cea52dd-e6df-4b10-b052-eb3066a311fa-0
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:16.041
Work instead. Even though she
loved to read and and made her

9cea52dd-e6df-4b10-b052-eb3066a311fa-1
00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:21.078
work all day, putting coal in
the fire and feeding the fire

9cea52dd-e6df-4b10-b052-eb3066a311fa-2
00:49:21.078 --> 00:49:26.283
all day long, that was her job.
Even though she loved to read

9cea52dd-e6df-4b10-b052-eb3066a311fa-3
00:49:26.283 --> 00:49:28.550
and her her talent was for.

10126295-fdcc-4cbd-96e5-5e68ceda0df7-0
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.090
Umm.

6f96cb79-7f9a-464f-a729-90bbed95f63d-0
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.448
Reading and education. But she
was forced to go into labor and

6f96cb79-7f9a-464f-a729-90bbed95f63d-1
00:49:35.448 --> 00:49:39.774
and keep the fires burning and
it was a dirty job and and it

6f96cb79-7f9a-464f-a729-90bbed95f63d-2
00:49:39.774 --> 00:49:44.243
was a hard job. And she did it
in the in the hot, in the heat,

6f96cb79-7f9a-464f-a729-90bbed95f63d-3
00:49:44.243 --> 00:49:46.300
in the rain and the snow and.

fdaa701d-61d0-4f52-bb8a-ac294fc112af-0
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.042
Not only did she have to keep
the fire going, but she had to

fdaa701d-61d0-4f52-bb8a-ac294fc112af-1
00:49:52.042 --> 00:49:55.654
clean out the the the smokestack
and that was very a very dirty

fdaa701d-61d0-4f52-bb8a-ac294fc112af-2
00:49:55.654 --> 00:49:55.879
job.

2a85b3e4-20cb-4cd4-9373-ff477068862c-0
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.830
And there were many girls like
her.

913e27e7-b24b-4590-a0f1-c5d3d89d21dd-0
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.210
They were.

c9f1e51a-9986-4265-98d3-19846d30b89d-0
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:13.159
Keeping the energy going in the
house, in in the city by feeding

c9f1e51a-9986-4265-98d3-19846d30b89d-1
00:50:13.159 --> 00:50:13.540
the.

1238f917-5efd-4cd2-bf8e-97fd2e5d8d04-0
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.440
The furnaces throughout the
city.

b9d8772f-d04c-4dd4-9030-9b6e866012b3-0
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.728
But it made her so sad. She'd
come home every day and just cry

b9d8772f-d04c-4dd4-9030-9b6e866012b3-1
00:50:21.728 --> 00:50:24.670
because really all she wanted to
do was read.

2a9123bb-480c-4664-94b0-2a2e5dc3947f-0
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:30.499
But one day she was able. The
person who was keeping her

2a9123bb-480c-4664-94b0-2a2e5dc3947f-1
00:50:30.499 --> 00:50:33.270
captive had gone, and she was
able to.

f1b05135-2841-4b58-bed7-c41d8b0e5733-0
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:39.203
Break into the drawer where her
book was kept, and had found

f1b05135-2841-4b58-bed7-c41d8b0e5733-1
00:50:39.203 --> 00:50:39.850
that he.

5ad09c85-2f25-459d-bd8f-7a609578e723-0
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:45.965
And unlocked the door and took
her book and ran away. She ran

5ad09c85-2f25-459d-bd8f-7a609578e723-1
00:50:45.965 --> 00:50:51.400
to the train station and found a
a car that had an open door.

58415798-df8f-404d-9fda-a33f61d5f44e-0
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.390
And.

d7deda7c-a5e8-4aac-840f-6b33210131df-0
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:57.580
Hid herself on the door and
waited for the train to leave.

06db0e15-f427-46c0-b5e9-7b38193dba6c-0
00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:05.066
And she left it all behind. So
her life of hardship and and of

06db0e15-f427-46c0-b5e9-7b38193dba6c-1
00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:05.710
Labor.

596a35d5-5459-4d97-bcdd-f0f9b43c7295-0
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.873
Give it away for a future that
she didn't know about, but that

596a35d5-5459-4d97-bcdd-f0f9b43c7295-1
00:51:09.873 --> 00:51:12.980
she knew that she really wanted
because she had her book.

425066a3-51f2-4c8f-ac77-efa80ce7a9d9-0
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.370
{Turn the page.}

16bcdec2-f087-4722-b7b2-38d270f7888e-0
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:26.249
And as she was making her way to
her new future, the man who was

16bcdec2-f087-4722-b7b2-38d270f7888e-1
00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:29.200
searching for someone was on
his.

e6f18b3f-43d9-468c-a409-509201f8f856-0
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.100
Boat ship,

372bf96f-084f-448e-aae0-c6e07ccc6887-0
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:36.667
Flying through the air, heading
to a destination that he wasn't

372bf96f-084f-448e-aae0-c6e07ccc6887-1
00:51:36.667 --> 00:51:40.574
sure of, but he knew that this
woman could help him, and so

372bf96f-084f-448e-aae0-c6e07ccc6887-2
00:51:40.574 --> 00:51:43.960
they were traveling together,
both with their pets.

53b05a7f-0caa-43f5-8fce-0eef8f2b669f-0
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.200
And.

738c563f-05be-4dd0-962b-cf16fd009894-0
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:51.934
The the the announcement came
that that the boat ship was

738c563f-05be-4dd0-962b-cf16fd009894-1
00:51:51.934 --> 00:51:57.118
landing and it was time to
disembark. So the boat landed

738c563f-05be-4dd0-962b-cf16fd009894-2
00:51:57.118 --> 00:52:02.939
and he thanked the woman for all
of her help and he and his pet

738c563f-05be-4dd0-962b-cf16fd009894-3
00:52:02.939 --> 00:52:04.940
pig shark walked away.

32c11258-dda8-45b7-8e54-9338966e9cbb-0
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.630
And as he got off the boat into
this new place.

44ab3746-aab8-4c7d-a2e8-56cb60aeff89-0
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.720
He looked.

836476d8-d280-4ec5-b91a-eeab76256c22-0
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:19.570
Across the the landscape and saw
a huge.

716106e2-3ba6-41af-9f62-095218ff9413-0
00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.180
Concrete statue of.

7a083709-0d44-4915-b676-3983ebad5d72-0
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.590
A creature.

d8bfd892-3d85-44cc-94d2-5cfa9220d73c-0
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.780
That.

f00124c1-8a9c-4041-b5b6-99a28a4300de-0
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:32.403
Had a flat head with some ears
sticking out and all kinds of

f00124c1-8a9c-4041-b5b6-99a28a4300de-1
00:52:32.403 --> 00:52:33.800
bowl shaped things

61ad0d48-bcf0-4a32-bf80-02d93ddc8012-0
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.890
at the base of it.

8d998af6-2efa-4614-b511-be4b2d281224-0
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.880
And lots of concrete ramps.

053ad7c0-40b0-46cc-98b5-5c1f99621721-0
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.420
Leading up to it.

2d586c62-6016-4b08-964a-e905b1a332ca-0
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:48.260
And it was a city of concrete
and cones and.

b04ffca0-0649-4312-876b-d84910dbba80-0
00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.660
One of the wheels that was the.

1b6eb415-6030-4023-b685-7a3e7010d431-0
00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.853
Of the steam wheel was also part
of the landscape of this part of

1b6eb415-6030-4023-b685-7a3e7010d431-1
00:53:00.853 --> 00:53:02.310
the city as well.

78a6fd7f-d67b-4dbf-90ec-b8e32d4e5335-0
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:07.831
So he stood at the top of the
steps and thought, how do I get

78a6fd7f-d67b-4dbf-90ec-b8e32d4e5335-1
00:53:07.831 --> 00:53:12.323
there? How do I get to this huge
concrete structure? {You can

78a6fd7f-d67b-4dbf-90ec-b8e32d4e5335-2
00:53:12.323 --> 00:53:13.410
turn the page.}

5728578a-2995-4106-9cee-998bdc6c02f6-0
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.700
So he and his little pet walked
through the streets.

46d20e3f-d262-4d95-8cf3-eb7d8cf3fb21-0
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.340
Looking at the different people.

993c64d6-abc8-4519-b387-460492f23c4f-0
00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.770
Watching what people were doing
and trying to learn how people

993c64d6-abc8-4519-b387-460492f23c4f-1
00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:34.560
were living in this part of the
the in this part of the world.

1929edbe-60da-4b0f-9178-27f6101c6d72-0
00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:41.442
They had their interesting
different foods they were able

1929edbe-60da-4b0f-9178-27f6101c6d72-1
00:53:41.442 --> 00:53:41.680
to.

a32145ae-5cdf-4407-baad-38dce8aea392-0
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.090
Buy food.

9b859055-6340-437b-b308-826af39042dc-0
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:51.794
Looking through little windows
and they had their interesting

9b859055-6340-437b-b308-826af39042dc-1
00:53:51.794 --> 00:53:52.080
pets.

8f092680-f094-4d7f-b83c-3add2c613b44-0
00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:57.100
And he didn't speak their
language, but he did have a book

8f092680-f094-4d7f-b83c-3add2c613b44-1
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.350
that showed him what they were.

996e84f0-2a4e-4b02-a8a3-3c5c5ecebdfc-0
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.969
You know, that showed him how to
communicate, so he was able to

996e84f0-2a4e-4b02-a8a3-3c5c5ecebdfc-1
00:54:05.969 --> 00:54:09.784
see, you know, ask for food and
ask for the things that you

996e84f0-2a4e-4b02-a8a3-3c5c5ecebdfc-2
00:54:09.784 --> 00:54:10.230
needed.

962bf7cd-5024-4667-aeb8-efb444d58325-0
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:16.377
And little shark, pig shark was
also able to figure these things

962bf7cd-5024-4667-aeb8-efb444d58325-1
00:54:16.377 --> 00:54:21.592
out. He seemed like a really
smart pet, and he helped the man

962bf7cd-5024-4667-aeb8-efb444d58325-2
00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:24.200
find the things that he needed.

9aed40af-1497-4923-9ff7-299fc39b5fb2-0
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:31.374
And so he went and opened a
drawer that contained these

9aed40af-1497-4923-9ff7-299fc39b5fb2-1
00:54:31.374 --> 00:54:34.620
little bulbs that had tails
that.

40b38bc6-f4e1-473c-bdd4-3bd915f8529c-0
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.230

The.

e080f718-bed8-4720-8ccf-d0b013ba135e-0

Turns out.

1e7cb29b-b1b2-4193-b783-1aca89e2b18d-0
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.390


2387a62f-ee13-48f3-a104-55ac122b5d5e-0
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:55.150
The friends that he made and had
dinner with before he left.

f76411e2-7be4-467b-9c26-6b195ac3e069-0
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.750

and.

71b24b9c-1c10-41eb-a558-e387c3d9b869-0
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.800
Have that, and so the man, his
friends

569d89ea-123f-468e-b073-99f63bb4c96e-0
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.110
Friends from the other night
showed him what he XX

77935e99-70df-4161-be9a-acf80efefdc6-0
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:46.020
{Sorry, I lost you.}

daf924e3-4898-4d54-9935-91255ab308f5-0
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.600
And so.

fa00f48b-b11b-414d-b861-701f8afa596e-0
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.170
The.

72416b95-dc87-4a94-8e7e-422f989b86f8-0

The man showed him.

6dd661e1-52a8-466e-b21a-e5aaf359d4e2-0
00:55:54.490 --> 00:56:00.179
How he could get, how he could
get what he wanted. And this man

6dd661e1-52a8-466e-b21a-e5aaf359d4e2-1
00:56:00.179 --> 00:56:00.980
wanted a.

e1e0b7c7-1982-4098-bcd8-1b2a28a07c3e-0
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:08.157
Squash. So he put the money in
and pressed a few buttons, and

e1e0b7c7-1982-4098-bcd8-1b2a28a07c3e-1
00:56:08.157 --> 00:56:10.340
out came his squash and.

1df46919-8212-476e-af3f-f54415968b20-0

He let the, he let his friends

1df46919-8212-476e-af3f-f54415968b20-1
00:56:15.515 --> 00:56:20.129
smelled the squash and his son
offered him a bowl that he could

1df46919-8212-476e-af3f-f54415968b20-2
00:56:20.129 --> 00:56:24.743

that the squash would be better

1df46919-8212-476e-af3f-f54415968b20-3
00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:29.357
than a than a loaf of bread. So
he took the bowl and the squash

1df46919-8212-476e-af3f-f54415968b20-4
00:56:29.357 --> 00:56:33.611
and they said, you know, they
pointed him in the direction

1df46919-8212-476e-af3f-f54415968b20-5

{and you can turn the page}.

9442a6c0-eafa-41a4-bd0e-0cfb9b2650ec-0
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:46.241
And and they offered. They
showed him a myriad of

9442a6c0-eafa-41a4-bd0e-0cfb9b2650ec-1

Types of food and and all kinds
of new things that they could.

366ae1a6-ab9c-42b6-871a-b2781f26b1c2-0
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.150
That he could.

95e4eb5c-2084-4b2d-9e06-df7dff6b0359-0

Try in this new part of the
world.

39b9649e-e344-4301-8aec-065436e4906b-0
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:07.017
And so they gave him a little
shrimp thing and squids and all

39b9649e-e344-4301-8aec-065436e4906b-1
00:57:07.017 --> 00:57:14.254

tomato looking fruits and.

00a96797-01dc-4560-aeb2-e4eb2b0b83cc-0

All kinds of interesting
animals, so they filled up his

00a96797-01dc-4560-aeb2-e4eb2b0b83cc-1
00:57:21.436 --> 00:57:22.410
bowl. They even.

0ea03c62-185e-4c53-9241-096743164f5b-0
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:24.960
Fed his pig shark pet.

2041f3b5-b07f-4bcb-823a-90f8f8bbf1a6-0
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:31.695
He sampled some of them, some of
the interesting types of food,

2041f3b5-b07f-4bcb-823a-90f8f8bbf1a6-1
00:57:31.695 --> 00:57:36.658
and they filled up his bowl. And
the little boy whispered

2041f3b5-b07f-4bcb-823a-90f8f8bbf1a6-2
00:57:36.658 --> 00:57:41.963
something in his dad's ear, and
his father put his arm around

2041f3b5-b07f-4bcb-823a-90f8f8bbf1a6-3
00:57:41.963 --> 00:57:42.990
the man and.

048b35a9-86b2-4abd-8ae5-1caef5e3b0f5-0
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:45.480
Said you know what?

fe1b914f-83d3-4720-abec-edde17afa4c9-0
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.368
We want to take, we want you to
have all these good things and

fe1b914f-83d3-4720-abec-edde17afa4c9-1
00:57:50.368 --> 00:57:54.446
we will walk with you to help
you take them to your next stop.

fe1b914f-83d3-4720-abec-edde17afa4c9-2
00:57:54.446 --> 00:57:58.719
And so the little boy pointed in
the direction they were heading,

fe1b914f-83d3-4720-abec-edde17afa4c9-3
00:57:58.719 --> 00:58:02.667
and he and his father and the
man who was traveling with his

fe1b914f-83d3-4720-abec-edde17afa4c9-4
00:58:02.667 --> 00:58:03.380
peak shark.

3e968d46-3d80-4678-a81e-24e84c7dbd09-0
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:06.500
Walked towards the boat.

fdffca1c-a3cb-4d61-a5ff-8d521c295414-0
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.130
So that the man could continue
on his journey.

251e223d-0367-4da4-b5a6-e3dc74fefa54-0
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.240
So they walked. They found a
boat.

2c13910d-8da8-4215-9bc4-035769be9fb4-0
00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.540
That had.

a2bcdcc2-a495-4ce8-8f4d-cbb699b95a21-0
00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:25.250
A piece of pottery on it.

0e5f4400-4bc9-4662-97e1-ffa4083efa05-0
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.020
And in the pottery was.

ba723718-ad5b-4d0a-bf48-e60cd57f5bbc-0
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:36.387
A scary animal. It startled the
man and jumped back because he

ba723718-ad5b-4d0a-bf48-e60cd57f5bbc-1
00:58:36.387 --> 00:58:41.130
had never seen the, a tail or
whatever this was.

4a7a7a89-54fe-4673-8dc0-2228491687e9-0
00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:42.080
But.

98cba381-d666-48fe-94ed-c3875cddc8bb-0
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.280
Once the.

fc41aea4-1966-4407-acdb-b13122537420-0
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:51.334
Once the little boy and the his
father showed him what actually

fc41aea4-1966-4407-acdb-b13122537420-1
00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:53.000
was in the the pottery.

9edefd91-fc15-4460-8ffc-f619409358b5-0
00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:59.116
The man was much more intrigued
and interested in what it was,

9edefd91-fc15-4460-8ffc-f619409358b5-1
00:58:59.116 --> 00:59:02.200
and it was a beautiful, exotic
looking.

5f7150da-e809-4a93-98d4-9238009dfb27-0
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.550


497e70f2-7408-4b80-87b8-46233ca414c0-0
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:11.846
Creature with almond shaped eyes
and it looked like a cat, but it

497e70f2-7408-4b80-87b8-46233ca414c0-1
00:59:11.846 --> 00:59:17.543
had a long dragon tail with
spikes and it was a friendly

497e70f2-7408-4b80-87b8-46233ca414c0-2
00:59:17.543 --> 00:59:24.140
animal. It wasn't a scary animal
and it was the boy's pet and the

497e70f2-7408-4b80-87b8-46233ca414c0-3
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.640
man was really.

a065da00-679a-415b-ac1f-44e836db5cb6-0
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:33.363
Excited to to see such a
wonderful exotic animal and they

a065da00-679a-415b-ac1f-44e836db5cb6-1
00:59:33.363 --> 00:59:39.584
laughed and and even the man's
pig shark pet got along with

a065da00-679a-415b-ac1f-44e836db5cb6-2
00:59:39.584 --> 00:59:42.279
this beautiful little cat.

358dc117-d712-4893-bcc3-533796415d4b-0
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:44.550


60448c0f-931e-423a-afc7-cfdf48378021-0
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:52.175
Lizard. So the cat lizard and
the pig shark played together

60448c0f-931e-423a-afc7-cfdf48378021-1
00:59:52.175 --> 00:59:56.190
and enjoyed each other's company
and the man.

6a1502e7-cecd-438d-8604-89f7a2aa33a7-0
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:03.778
Thanked the father for all he
had done for him. And then he

6a1502e7-cecd-438d-8604-89f7a2aa33a7-1
01:00:03.778 --> 01:00:08.923
drew a picture. He took out his
book in his journal where he was

6a1502e7-cecd-438d-8604-89f7a2aa33a7-2
01:00:08.923 --> 01:00:12.960
looking, and he drew a picture
of some houses and.

11cab17f-3e9f-4d77-845a-e6bed5f7eb86-0
01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:18.891
Something that he was searching
for and he showed it to the

11cab17f-3e9f-4d77-845a-e6bed5f7eb86-1
01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:20.690
father and the the father.

09f537d1-047f-40ec-a565-cf88fa50c1c2-0
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.270


6eeada6f-6ab2-46cc-a593-17c534805b59-0
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.793
Looked at it and said I think I,
I think I know what you're

6eeada6f-6ab2-46cc-a593-17c534805b59-1
01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:32.149
looking for, he said. I've seen
that, I've seen it. And he

6eeada6f-6ab2-46cc-a593-17c534805b59-2
01:00:32.149 --> 01:00:35.619
looked up and he said he thought
that he had seen it before.

d43f880a-414a-4a3d-a6b1-853ce88b2326-0
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.580
And so.

ce64d1f7-a7b9-4093-bd8c-ce53060c9656-0
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.465
The, the, the the picture gets
closer and closer to the father.

ce64d1f7-a7b9-4093-bd8c-ce53060c9656-1
01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:44.210
It and it.

76f7d2a0-93a6-43a0-bab2-076a54b63f3a-0
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.146
It shows his face, then it shows
his eye with a reflection of

76f7d2a0-93a6-43a0-bab2-076a54b63f3a-1
01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:52.639
something that looked like
flames in his eyes as he was

76f7d2a0-93a6-43a0-bab2-076a54b63f3a-2
01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:56.070
looking up into the sky.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.260
plain frames.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:42.889
In different shapes, diamonds
and hearts. And there's a

0e86fe71-ee68-4e5c-8a21-ee6fee37e703-1
01:04:42.889 --> 01:04:47.712
picture of a shark on the wall
with a pink frame around it. And

0e86fe71-ee68-4e5c-8a21-ee6fee37e703-2
01:04:47.712 --> 01:04:50.350
actually there's it looks like
it.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.500
It was.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:57.474
A picture of a shark in a tank
in the wall and the and the

72642443-6246-49b1-961f-029f0ab004fb-1
01:04:57.474 --> 01:05:00.310
water is leaking out of the tank
down the wall.

8b76958e-b2fe-4b0a-b314-5216c359087f-0
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:06.895
There's a beautiful pink flower
and an Oval shaped frame on the

8b76958e-b2fe-4b0a-b314-5216c359087f-1
01:05:06.895 --> 01:05:11.756
wall and there are two looks
like Romeo and Juliet pictures

8b76958e-b2fe-4b0a-b314-5216c359087f-2
01:05:11.756 --> 01:05:13.620
in heart-shaped frames.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.300
And it's just a big crowd of
people taking pictures off the

b00929d6-e626-49ac-b086-b9b757f59025-1
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.700

wall.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:27.695
On the walls and walking up and
down the steps to each of the

623f85a0-5050-4e5f-b043-b416152ddd2d-1
01:05:27.695 --> 01:05:29.350

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.410
OK, next we have a short story.

d7b34b58-c6ef-48eb-ac4c-742d2295a4e8-0
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.380
Finds his way through the city.

f52ace9c-5cad-4d9e-bccc-a09d385cda9c-0
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:35.760
With his.

3d5455f4-d8cc-4626-984b-f3cd7e35d278-0
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.260
Suitcase that that his friends
gave to him.

98fbb5a3-21a7-4482-a75b-2578b0d21960-0
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.502
He sees all kinds of people.
He's just looking around at the

98fbb5a3-21a7-4482-a75b-2578b0d21960-1
01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:49.719
scenes. There's a young man with
a poster and newspapers under

98fbb5a3-21a7-4482-a75b-2578b0d21960-2
01:06:49.719 --> 01:06:53.668
his arm that has some of that
strange writing that the man

98fbb5a3-21a7-4482-a75b-2578b0d21960-3
01:06:53.668 --> 01:06:58.019
doesn't understand. And there's
a woman with another interesting

98fbb5a3-21a7-4482-a75b-2578b0d21960-4
01:06:58.019 --> 01:06:59.760
cat with a very long tail.

e5d9f11d-3357-43ca-9ba1-586d07cb6717-0
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:04.498
That kind of looks like a possum
tail. Probably they can hang

e5d9f11d-3357-43ca-9ba1-586d07cb6717-1
01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:05.900
from a tree with that.

78193270-506c-45b2-a051-9302bdb1bbbe-0
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:12.140
And there's a man selling
peanuts and coffee at a, at a

78193270-506c-45b2-a051-9302bdb1bbbe-1
01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:18.204
wheeled vendor stand. And he has
an interesting pet that looks

78193270-506c-45b2-a051-9302bdb1bbbe-2
01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:24.268
like an iguana iguana sitting in
a basket on the on his little

78193270-506c-45b2-a051-9302bdb1bbbe-3
01:07:24.268 --> 01:07:24.749
cart.

793b98e5-c1d3-46f6-bd9a-a237625388b3-0
01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:30.995
And there are. There's a man and
a woman loading big eggs into a

793b98e5-c1d3-46f6-bd9a-a237625388b3-1
01:07:30.995 --> 01:07:36.064
a wooden basket with straw in it
to to keep them safe. And

793b98e5-c1d3-46f6-bd9a-a237625388b3-2
01:07:36.064 --> 01:07:41.306
there's a Barber giving a shave
to a a a man on a on a stool

793b98e5-c1d3-46f6-bd9a-a237625388b3-3
01:07:41.306 --> 01:07:46.805
with snails crawling and crabs
crawling all around the grounds.

793b98e5-c1d3-46f6-bd9a-a237625388b3-4
01:07:46.805 --> 01:07:51.360
Some are big, some are small.
And there's the woman.

89da56ab-e641-43ef-a59e-5ba7731ab5d2-0
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.583
Reading from a book as her
friend knits and another child

89da56ab-e641-43ef-a59e-5ba7731ab5d2-1
01:07:57.583 --> 01:08:03.505
sits with a Bunny sitting in her
lap and there's some men playing

89da56ab-e641-43ef-a59e-5ba7731ab5d2-2
01:08:03.505 --> 01:08:09.337
an accordion instrument that has
a Big Horn coming out of it and

89da56ab-e641-43ef-a59e-5ba7731ab5d2-3
01:08:09.337 --> 01:08:11.580
someone playing a violin.

b73af241-bb1a-4146-b7ce-89c73b295523-0
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:13.370
With some.

de3e3add-a899-4ddd-9cff-d4fa767f184f-0
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:18.366
Interesting looking birds
standing around listening to the

de3e3add-a899-4ddd-9cff-d4fa767f184f-1
01:08:18.366 --> 01:08:22.808
music, and he's looking at all
of these scenes and wondering

de3e3add-a899-4ddd-9cff-d4fa767f184f-2
01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:23.610
where am I?

5ba8ec83-d37b-423f-a485-f7fae6071285-0
01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:26.340
How do I get home?

1271c143-3b28-49fb-a230-255e33fb0987-0
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:28.220
{Next page.}

41a891f1-4565-4b6d-abf7-fbde01bc1419-0
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.430
Then he takes out his watch.

1847df44-1f1d-40bf-90ba-051f374c91b7-0
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:37.970
And he because he's he's worried
about the time.

dd4cdbc6-1db1-4076-ab36-7be1c1c2ccbf-0
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.486
And he, he looks at his clock,
and then he looks up at a clock

dd4cdbc6-1db1-4076-ab36-7be1c1c2ccbf-1
01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:46.213
that he sees in the main square
where all these people are and

dd4cdbc6-1db1-4076-ab36-7be1c1c2ccbf-2
01:08:46.213 --> 01:08:48.520
all these scenes that he was
watching.

9f1b8d64-7120-4b0d-8d67-465133bccf89-0
01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.792
And he notices that the clock
doesn't really look like his

9f1b8d64-7120-4b0d-8d67-465133bccf89-1
01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:56.466
clock, and so he's a little
confused as to what time it is.

9f1b8d64-7120-4b0d-8d67-465133bccf89-2
01:08:56.466 --> 01:09:00.324
So he starts to wander through
the city and he's wandering and

9f1b8d64-7120-4b0d-8d67-465133bccf89-3
01:09:00.324 --> 01:09:04.181
he's walking with his suitcase,
but he seems to also have lost

9f1b8d64-7120-4b0d-8d67-465133bccf89-4
01:09:04.181 --> 01:09:05.100
his little pet.

ef1b0bce-4adf-40aa-b7c0-5cdc1de904fd-0
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.970
Pig shark pet.

0767445f-d3b0-40e8-89e9-529d77dc776e-0
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.520
And um

69c96303-746e-4858-8b33-e57ff3559cf4-0
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.700
He must have left him with the
the man and his son.

82d5de92-685c-4a6d-b7c4-e34d0b5d5920-0
01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.370
Earlier in the day when he got
the boat.

5bd6d68e-c33f-4ec0-9171-71d2b82f3255-0
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:23.270
So anyway, as he's walking
through the city.

85176f20-3411-431d-be93-58d63fcda7bf-0
01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:24.660
These.

d16688b6-354a-42c4-a34f-b74db88652eb-0
01:09:25.690 --> 01:09:26.220
Very.

af4137da-2c09-4ef0-a094-734113db06d2-0
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.436
Very fluffy white lights start
dropping from the sky. They look

af4137da-2c09-4ef0-a094-734113db06d2-1
01:09:32.436 --> 01:09:35.540
like snowflakes, but they light
up.

d22bb1ea-2ab8-49f7-a74b-5b1defd80928-0
01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.290
And.

ba0848c0-9334-4253-86ed-a4496b5426f5-0
01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.148
he's wondering what they are.
But then a gust of wind blows

ba0848c0-9334-4253-86ed-a4496b5426f5-1
01:09:42.148 --> 01:09:45.857
and it blows his hat off and it
blows all the little fluffy

ba0848c0-9334-4253-86ed-a4496b5426f5-2
01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:46.970
white lights away.

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-0
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.162
And he chases his hat and he
finds it laying on the ground

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-1
01:09:52.162 --> 01:09:56.474
and he picks it up. But as he
picks it up, he notices that

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-2
01:09:56.474 --> 01:10:00.786
there are arrows, words, in
fact. And so he looks at those

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-3
01:10:00.786 --> 01:10:05.025
arrows and words. And then he
looks at his book that he's

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-4
01:10:05.025 --> 01:10:09.629
carrying, and he tries to make
sense of whether or not this is

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-5
01:10:09.629 --> 01:10:14.014
another clue as to where he
needs to be and how he's to get

5f3c836e-e79b-418c-930d-2db2b081fdd5-6
01:10:14.014 --> 01:10:14.380
home.

8facc132-90d2-4065-a745-b40725ef6417-0
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.620
So as he's looking at his book
as a.

e51e3f9b-c9fc-4922-8607-2a799a209ee8-0
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:21.320
As a traveler would look at
their map.

fbac65b8-08b1-4d7a-a4cc-f3175c4b251c-0
01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.613
A man touches him on the
shoulder and says, can I help

fbac65b8-08b1-4d7a-a4cc-f3175c4b251c-1
01:10:25.613 --> 01:10:25.870
you?

96ff9a3c-b0f5-4a39-9727-e6b2b048cede-0
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.590
And he starts explaining to the
man. This man.

fcdb40af-36f6-4bad-a6c5-28a6f7be6059-0
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:35.855
Comes from somewhere in the
Middle East. He has a a turban

fcdb40af-36f6-4bad-a6c5-28a6f7be6059-1
01:10:35.855 --> 01:10:38.860
looking thing on his head and a
white.

c2784251-d69c-4173-bee6-13d38dc20e10-0
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:41.430
Tunic.

d8401f7e-4dbc-4126-adce-656ce08c0447-0
01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.517
On. He says, can I help you? And
the man starts explaining to him

d8401f7e-4dbc-4126-adce-656ce08c0447-1
01:10:46.517 --> 01:10:49.950
what he's looking for and the
the man in the tunic.

543671f9-c959-4c0f-81f2-f1db15c926a8-0
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:56.460
Says, well, show me what you
you, you know, try to show me.

543671f9-c959-4c0f-81f2-f1db15c926a8-1
01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.096
So the the man with the book,
who's lost, draws a picture of

543671f9-c959-4c0f-81f2-f1db15c926a8-2
01:11:01.096 --> 01:11:02.920
his bed with his window.

ddb28786-98a8-4afc-95f5-090443efaebf-0
01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:04.680
That he.

f5176ba6-6e0e-43f3-a82c-16927c23d144-0
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.652
And his apartment that he's
looking for, and the man in the

f5176ba6-6e0e-43f3-a82c-16927c23d144-1
01:11:09.652 --> 01:11:11.530

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:16.077
Aha, I know what you're talking
about. And he points him in the

3a254d8f-3a4c-423a-833d-95583a37d39e-1
01:11:16.077 --> 01:11:18.800
right direction, in a direction.
He says go this way.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.760
And as the man in the tunic
walks away.

631af005-dc8a-47b1-9df7-85eb1f0c6da7-0
01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:28.262
The man with the suitcase
looking for his apartment sees a

631af005-dc8a-47b1-9df7-85eb1f0c6da7-1
01:11:28.262 --> 01:11:29.890

01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:33.880
An interesting animal.

9bc7727a-3c97-480c-a51d-3a72a667cb20-0
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.410
Like an aardvark on his back in
a little basket.

f1ddc852-cee1-48f3-91eb-90a15134b8d0-0
01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:44.025
And he's just adding all the
strange things that he's seen

f1ddc852-cee1-48f3-91eb-90a15134b8d0-1
01:11:44.025 --> 01:11:45.420

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.110
OK, Next is a complex scene.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.750
Every part of an airport on this
scene that you're looking at.

02cabe3e-ebca-4425-af1b-d5bd83e1c38a-0
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:46.720
There is the.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:52.500
Main area of the airport, the
tarmac where you have the planes

61075cf9-e434-414d-af79-dfe507ea8135-1
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.770
parked and the fuel train, the
fuel trucks.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:57.320
Part.

a8ae0dbe-11fb-4c83-8304-01f2cd7148f5-0
01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.500
And the luggage

d92f460a-8e36-48cd-bbbb-1c744bb444f9-0
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.250
Truck's parked and the luggage
is strewn all over the the.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:16.727
The tarmac area. There are
people everywhere, people

bead2483-5c2d-4792-8d9b-a8be14828e04-1
01:13:16.727 --> 01:13:19.780
disembarking from the plane.

7a9c3ada-0203-4cea-96f7-e3dd8e1edd2c-0
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:25.463
The plane is parked on the
tarmac, so they're coming down a

7a9c3ada-0203-4cea-96f7-e3dd8e1edd2c-1
01:13:25.463 --> 01:13:29.720
set of steps and walking down on
the tarmac into the building.

120faaca-072a-4d3b-8c75-04eb5b7eb839-0
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:37.886
And as they're doing that, the
the luggage guys are unloading

120faaca-072a-4d3b-8c75-04eb5b7eb839-1
01:13:37.886 --> 01:13:45.242
the luggage into the baggage
carts and there is a fire truck

120faaca-072a-4d3b-8c75-04eb5b7eb839-2
01:13:45.242 --> 01:13:50.790
coming and it's squirting people
by accident.

cea160b2-6e95-432c-adcb-aef94c5640da-0
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:55.270
And there are 12345.

01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.560
6, 7 different planes.

76a2c396-f612-48f0-a506-3d214d1b94ab-0
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:01.520
In the picture and.

9e18ef4c-430a-4064-b13c-dd934e2f5fa8-0
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:07.351
The one plane has arrived,
people are getting off. The

9e18ef4c-430a-4064-b13c-dd934e2f5fa8-1
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:11.258
other. The the in another part
of the picture there's a bus

9e18ef4c-430a-4064-b13c-dd934e2f5fa8-2
01:14:11.258 --> 01:14:15.100
with people getting on that will
take them to their plane.

d812afa5-54b8-4b94-940b-6cfb1ca54981-0
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:17.290
And.

67a2ba32-05c0-433e-8d0d-80031f919ac4-0
01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:23.894
So it's just a very chaotic
scene of people at an airport

67a2ba32-05c0-433e-8d0d-80031f919ac4-1
01:14:23.894 --> 01:14:29.262
doing what people do, from
working at the airport to

67a2ba32-05c0-433e-8d0d-80031f919ac4-2
01:14:29.262 --> 01:14:35.745
working the forklift and lifting
up the cargo that will go into

67a2ba32-05c0-433e-8d0d-80031f919ac4-3
01:14:35.745 --> 01:14:41.923
the cargo hold of the plane.
There's also men putting in the

67a2ba32-05c0-433e-8d0d-80031f919ac4-4
01:14:41.923 --> 01:14:48.406
the food, the food service into
the plane. There's a big square

67a2ba32-05c0-433e-8d0d-80031f919ac4-5
01:14:48.406 --> 01:14:48.710
of.

93ab5b98-0253-4531-8a29-fc14cb6bcf2b-0
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:53.969
Food that's going into the rear
of a plane, the same plane that

93ab5b98-0253-4531-8a29-fc14cb6bcf2b-1
01:14:53.969 --> 01:14:57.430
the people are getting off of.
It's being restocked.

31eb48a4-8dc7-4ca9-bd01-325096529d36-0
01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:03.732
Umm, there's also an interesting
little biplane there that has a

31eb48a4-8dc7-4ca9-bd01-325096529d36-1
01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:08.588
card sticking out where the
normally the pilot would sit.

31eb48a4-8dc7-4ca9-bd01-325096529d36-2
01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:13.361
There's a ace of spades card
that's sitting in the pilot

31eb48a4-8dc7-4ca9-bd01-325096529d36-3
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:13.779
seat.

6a112cc5-60a3-424a-ad05-ba8db2f207ea-0
01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:18.110
And there is.

b821dc9c-dd8a-4ae7-9423-1a6afeae65ff-0
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:23.413
Something I've never seen
before, a plane where the nose

b821dc9c-dd8a-4ae7-9423-1a6afeae65ff-1
01:15:23.413 --> 01:15:25.400
of the plane opens up and.

ee94a048-7186-4cd1-8551-28ec70021145-0
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:32.595
I guess cargo. They're putting
cargo in there. There's also an

ee94a048-7186-4cd1-8551-28ec70021145-1
01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:38.327
hot air balloon in the scene.
There's a dirigible, there's a,

ee94a048-7186-4cd1-8551-28ec70021145-2
01:15:38.327 --> 01:15:38.420
a

194d9cf8-1026-4ccf-9db3-2725c4e7cac5-0
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:44.604
What's it called? The SST jets?
The the high speed jet that is

194d9cf8-1026-4ccf-9db3-2725c4e7cac5-1
01:15:44.604 --> 01:15:47.840
no longer working that came from
England.

96b137db-74a7-451c-8350-7b0142ee0dc6-0
01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:52.270
And there's a rocket ship.

60b312c6-fc52-4c32-aabf-4a19cbc3cc1c-0
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.198
So anything that you can imagine
that flies. There's even a

60b312c6-fc52-4c32-aabf-4a19cbc3cc1c-1
01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:57.830
spaceship here in this picture.

d2effdb4-b306-47be-857b-364f32abda71-0
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:05.792
It's they're all milling about
or flying through the sky. And

d2effdb4-b306-47be-857b-364f32abda71-1
01:16:05.792 --> 01:16:11.384
there's there's a there is a
circus plane that's loading

d2effdb4-b306-47be-857b-364f32abda71-2
01:16:11.384 --> 01:16:13.150
elephants onto it.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:14.460
Umm.

4e9dffdd-499f-4205-865f-90e840dae24e-0
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:15.850
And.

213d76bd-fb47-47c8-8b86-b68a915bba6a-0
01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:21.399
Somebody dropped a huge shoe
onto the grassy area of the

213d76bd-fb47-47c8-8b86-b68a915bba6a-1
01:16:21.399 --> 01:16:25.120
tarmac and there are several
country flags.

66c5f025-51fa-4e6c-b18b-2ef837893359-0
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:30.132
Great Britain and the US flag
and the French flag and the

66c5f025-51fa-4e6c-b18b-2ef837893359-1
01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:30.960
German flag.

1d425533-cc02-4140-8d52-22d3e483f92f-0
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:34.550
And maybe the Italian flag or.

4e367176-d7e3-45f4-b516-af77ee99cc22-0
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:35.950
Irish flag.

8b84f4a3-8b79-43f9-9a1d-8d6a5fc32852-0
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:44.551
And then you get into the inside
part, where there's the baggage

8b84f4a3-8b79-43f9-9a1d-8d6a5fc32852-1
01:16:44.551 --> 01:16:49.264
claim, but there's also going
through security with. They

8b84f4a3-8b79-43f9-9a1d-8d6a5fc32852-2
01:16:49.264 --> 01:16:52.839
stopped a man that has knives
and his coat.

ab4d901c-b29d-452c-9fa0-4a14b71446b6-0
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.760
Lots of knives or watches or, I
think they're watches.

63f96ce7-76fa-48e7-8766-ca57e78674a5-0
01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.910
It's uh, he was trying to either
steal or sell.

57d2ecf4-0e88-474b-b195-b1bd440dffe2-0
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:07.488
And there are people just
waiting around, standing around

57d2ecf4-0e88-474b-b195-b1bd440dffe2-1
01:17:07.488 --> 01:17:10.320
waiting for their flight to
leave. There's a couple.

6b7f6213-5374-4d77-a205-980773fa37b7-0
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.170
Flight attendants and.

687efa40-86cc-4f26-8b0c-4f3cf6469d20-0
01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.100
And I think that's pretty much
it. #END_airport

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:34.280

Where someone has hung.

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:13.722
About 100 pictures. There's
small pictures and and medium

553da611-9af0-4184-966b-ac65b5a7d00a-1
01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:18.120

I want to say.

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.210
Interesting.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.840
Some of them are sports.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.920
I'll just describe some of the
pictures.

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:48.960
There is a knight with a knife,
with a sword and a.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.650
Oh.

a61db97e-4fc0-41a8-b4b9-2eb71d31c376-0
01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:57.395
A thing that you know for
protection. A shield. There's a

a61db97e-4fc0-41a8-b4b9-2eb71d31c376-1
01:18:57.395 --> 01:19:01.885
camel in a picture. There's
another night. There's a 2

a61db97e-4fc0-41a8-b4b9-2eb71d31c376-2
01:19:01.885 --> 01:19:06.130

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.557
The scene is full of boats.
There's a few boats on shore and

ff3e28d8-a125-4f75-a3e1-20ab09a1faa6-1
01:24:27.557 --> 01:24:31.490

5ad64be3-d3f2-4dfa-badc-88d60ef8333a-0
01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:47.110
Some of them, there's one very
large pirate ship.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:55.092
That has three masts, 4 masts
and it's filled with pirates and

253d00a9-5c65-4d80-90bc-370c908daf81-1
01:24:55.092 --> 01:24:56.120

Two or three Eagle's nests where
the pirates are standing up in

8168ac1b-70ab-4c1d-8b00-a23f1c6afdc9-1
01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.462
the top and the nest looking out

Cannons firing.

boats.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.120
And.

9fd83d93-b764-4de2-989c-8d94206beb8c-0
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.420
Basically, it's a scene of.

20edd19b-9c7d-4f6d-9c65-d135d0245632-0
01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.660
Chaos with.

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:38.616
Attacking. The pirates coming
from the shore, attacking the

051e7faf-6de1-4566-8fa9-12a6f61cff01-1
01:25:38.616 --> 01:25:41.170
boat that is in the harbor, and.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.930
So there are three big boats in
the harbor.

28d9748f-c4e3-4d3b-8498-5523d26092be-0
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:53.330
And many many smaller rowboats
that hold about.

a6b65241-3771-44db-8eda-c5509fc75dd7-0
01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.414
10 pirates in each boat and some
of those boats have cannons on

a6b65241-3771-44db-8eda-c5509fc75dd7-1
01:25:58.414 --> 01:26:02.403
them that are shooting into the
big boat that are trying to

a6b65241-3771-44db-8eda-c5509fc75dd7-2
01:26:02.403 --> 01:26:03.600
capture the boats.

9059bf8d-2c82-4c72-a0d7-7791a8b52fc4-0
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:08.230
But the big boat is trying to
defend itself as best as

9059bf8d-2c82-4c72-a0d7-7791a8b52fc4-1
01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:11.795
possible, and so it's also
shooting its cannons. It has

9059bf8d-2c82-4c72-a0d7-7791a8b52fc4-2
01:26:11.795 --> 01:26:14.660
three different cannons that
face the shore.

9f72dcd6-d1a3-47f1-ba5c-c71d4f22f3a6-0
01:26:15.850 --> 01:26:18.895
And it's shooting at the boats
that are coming from the shore

9f72dcd6-d1a3-47f1-ba5c-c71d4f22f3a6-1
01:26:18.895 --> 01:26:20.320
that are filled with pirates.

b4decf6c-ccfb-46aa-aa23-2074103c9f03-0
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:21.820
And.

46090aa4-e4f2-46c6-94b6-99b361435fdc-0
01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.345
There are, some of the pirates
are still on the beach waiting

46090aa4-e4f2-46c6-94b6-99b361435fdc-1
01:26:29.345 --> 01:26:34.614
to, for a boat to come and get
them. And also in the middle of

46090aa4-e4f2-46c6-94b6-99b361435fdc-2
01:26:34.614 --> 01:26:39.799
all of this is a large octopus
green octopus who has a couple

01:26:39.799 --> 01:26:41.639
of the pirates in his.

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:43.480
Tentacles.

c26077ef-9cd6-4025-aee5-37ceb436ca9b-0
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.760
And he has some holding them up
in the air, looking like he's

c26077ef-9cd6-4025-aee5-37ceb436ca9b-1
01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.130
ready to throw them into the
water.

bc1e13e3-38a3-400a-9b64-035891424c47-0
01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.410
And.

837cfb7d-b57e-473a-8913-ec8438137ebf-0
01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.331
There are lots. There are
several pirate flags with skull

837cfb7d-b57e-473a-8913-ec8438137ebf-1
01:27:01.331 --> 01:27:03.040
and crossbones crossbones.

24705f1c-3673-4e2e-bc97-113894672767-0
01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:04.590
On it.

4977bb23-8285-496d-b17f-3ac316eaecdb-0
01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:09.020
And most of the pirates are.

ab5e2459-266b-43f2-8cc7-a7d83df3021f-0
01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:11.380
Or some of the pirates are
wearing.

322688c3-40de-4ba0-83b8-11f20e6b5332-0
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.950
Blue and white shirts.

1b754004-876c-4e04-a1a6-5ddd77b0190e-0
01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.540
And a lot of them have.

223fd0a5-beff-49bd-a8b9-641c549f54e3-0
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:23.368
Their red kerchiefs on their
heads that are tied like typical

223fd0a5-beff-49bd-a8b9-641c549f54e3-1
01:27:23.368 --> 01:27:27.870
pirates wear, and they've got
their swords and their.

534be361-c78a-4b49-867f-13b3dbbe76ff-0
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:29.490
Umm.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:35.700
Waldo.

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:37.890
Uh.

0d99aaee-3ea2-4fbf-8b0a-9c5756700978-0
01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.990
Somebody's even walking the
plank they've got.

e5cfcf87-6855-41a4-a05a-5d2c551be69a-0
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.740
So it looks like.

025ac65a-a201-4e7e-9015-7a15ebff3230-0
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.210
Maybe the people in the blue and
white shirts.

d0c7a1a2-9f4e-428a-a5ff-60591884195f-0
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.148
Are the ones that are being
attacked by because one of them

d0c7a1a2-9f4e-428a-a5ff-60591884195f-1
01:27:55.148 --> 01:27:57.020
is being forced to walk the
plank.

243abc67-173d-49f2-9dad-41467f5b76ea-0
01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:02.721
By a pirate in red and he has
this sword and the pirate or the

243abc67-173d-49f2-9dad-41467f5b76ea-1
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:06.930
the person in the blue and
white, if he is a pirate.

c6861044-4fa3-47dc-b768-2b1b2ee1fc3c-0
01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:11.723
He's worried he's going to drop
off the edge any minute into the

c6861044-4fa3-47dc-b768-2b1b2ee1fc3c-1
01:28:11.723 --> 01:28:12.110
water.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.020
Umm.

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:16.200
And it looks like.

92d1e55b-1e7e-49da-a927-cef57797c0e8-0
01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:21.920
In one of the crows nests, one
of the attacking boats shot.

fbe06ea9-06f3-4a16-a894-5436e40964de-0
01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:28.012
A Cannon ball into the pirates'
nest and blew it up. And so some

fbe06ea9-06f3-4a16-a894-5436e40964de-1
01:28:28.012 --> 01:28:32.541
of the pirates are flying all
over the place and some of their

fbe06ea9-06f3-4a16-a894-5436e40964de-2
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:35.920
limbs and heads and things are
floating there.

8827d08c-3473-487e-b845-7828eb60d616-0
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:37.380
Umm.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.590
And then along the coast where
the beaches there's.

a5e7833b-8d87-4fd7-9e02-cdc59891a442-0
01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:45.260
Some waves.

f0fe08ac-047a-4301-89a2-dfdac0eb78e0-0
01:28:54.010 --> 01:28:56.502
.And some people, some of the
pirates are floating in the

f0fe08ac-047a-4301-89a2-dfdac0eb78e0-1
01:28:56.502 --> 01:28:56.760
waves.
