00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.276
As a reminder, in this study
you're describing two types of

2282beb4-fa02-46e9-8ec8-a06b6371234c-1
00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:11.512
pictures to help us to create
naming target and for visual

2282beb4-fa02-46e9-8ec8-a06b6371234c-2
00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.230
treatment.

aca5910f-b1a8-477d-b543-417d172901d3-0
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.386
For the first item, it is a
complex scene, so take between

aca5910f-b1a8-477d-b543-417d172901d3-1
00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:22.932
three and five minutes. I'm
going to just look at the time

aca5910f-b1a8-477d-b543-417d172901d3-2
00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:28.018
it's you describe, describe what
you see and what is happening in

aca5910f-b1a8-477d-b543-417d172901d3-3
00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:32.949
as much detail as you can, and
you can start when you're ready.

b540b228-e13c-4c8c-bccd-b7b9c103b018-0
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.091
#START_exhibit_12 So this is an
art gallery. There are several

b540b228-e13c-4c8c-bccd-b7b9c103b018-1
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:45.427
pictures that are framed on all
of on the walls, and they're

b540b228-e13c-4c8c-bccd-b7b9c103b018-2
00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:50.238
about three floors. So on the
ground floor, one of the

b540b228-e13c-4c8c-bccd-b7b9c103b018-3
00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:55.749
pictures I'm first drawn to on
the right side of the page is a

b540b228-e13c-4c8c-bccd-b7b9c103b018-4
00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.348
clown. He's got a Red Nose and
he's got a hat that's green with

b540b228-e13c-4c8c-bccd-b7b9c103b018-5
00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:05.109
little flowers. And then as you
go around.

67a46441-7052-408d-95b8-88d4b451fc67-0
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.330
There's also a famous painting.

01a1bfc6-cb98-4e8f-947f-2c86e4a38549-0
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.966
Umm, it looks like that one
painting. It's like the American

01a1bfc6-cb98-4e8f-947f-2c86e4a38549-1
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.992
dream or something, but it's got
the two. It's got the wife and

01a1bfc6-cb98-4e8f-947f-2c86e4a38549-2
00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:19.829
the husband, and she's wearing a
red blouse and he's wearing

01a1bfc6-cb98-4e8f-947f-2c86e4a38549-3
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.540
blazer and that's almost to the
left side of the page and.

5d0158da-dae9-4eb8-ac03-0a3995d5c1f8-0
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.103
Then there's another picture of
a man with a really squiggly

5d0158da-dae9-4eb8-ac03-0a3995d5c1f8-1
00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:35.220
orange mustache and those that's
right next to the stairs. It

5d0158da-dae9-4eb8-ac03-0a3995d5c1f8-2
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.088
looks like people are also
taking pictures down and buying

5d0158da-dae9-4eb8-ac03-0a3995d5c1f8-3
00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:45.040
the art, which is very cool. Or
they're stealing it, or but

5d0158da-dae9-4eb8-ac03-0a3995d5c1f8-4
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.908
they're holding it, and so
they're walking up and down the

5d0158da-dae9-4eb8-ac03-0a3995d5c1f8-5
00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:54.860
stairs with it. And if you go
all the way to the top floor.

f5932254-1d22-4eb2-983d-a64a89421127-0
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.970
There's a shark.

5d28e7c0-b9a1-477c-a4ee-4dd232a7f93a-0
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.540
It looks like it's a painting,
but I it also appears to be

5d28e7c0-b9a1-477c-a4ee-4dd232a7f93a-1
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.193
leaking water. So it could be an
aquarium, which is whim

5d28e7c0-b9a1-477c-a4ee-4dd232a7f93a-2
00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:16.441
mystical. And then there's also
a it looks like a person right

5d28e7c0-b9a1-477c-a4ee-4dd232a7f93a-3
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:22.788
next to the shark. To the left
of the shark there's a person in

5d28e7c0-b9a1-477c-a4ee-4dd232a7f93a-4
00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:28.540
a red shirt and they have they
looks like they're inside.

f0cfe788-ebcc-44ca-ab87-7e745c92f5fa-0
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.070
Of.

d1f92222-8adf-45af-a923-b822793ef827-0
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.823
A window, almost. It's not a
painting. It looks like a

d1f92222-8adf-45af-a923-b822793ef827-1
00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:33.190
window.

f88ba899-5a98-4132-a8c3-34fef6abe32a-0
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.450
Um, and next to?

f1e0290a-21aa-4fbd-95a2-e444ace43f4a-0
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.377
To the left of that, there are
almost like ladders on top of

f1e0290a-21aa-4fbd-95a2-e444ace43f4a-1
00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:46.859
each other that people are
climbing up to get to the

f1e0290a-21aa-4fbd-95a2-e444ace43f4a-2
00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.750
paintings and be able to see the
paintings.

a9d2eb43-0f79-46d7-80f2-d6ace2308f06-0
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.075
And then there's also a picture.
There's two sets of four

a9d2eb43-0f79-46d7-80f2-d6ace2308f06-1
00:02:56.075 --> 00:03:01.108
paintings on either side of
those those ladders, they're all

a9d2eb43-0f79-46d7-80f2-d6ace2308f06-2
00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:06.554
gold and they all they show show
a variety of different hats, the

a9d2eb43-0f79-46d7-80f2-d6ace2308f06-3
00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:11.587
tops of hats. And then at the
bottom are the people that are

a9d2eb43-0f79-46d7-80f2-d6ace2308f06-4
00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:16.619
wearing the hats, and they're
all kind of mixed and matched.

7946147d-3d6c-4fc6-9de9-1f9466682ad4-0
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.225
So you can see that that one
woman has a pointy pink hat, and

7946147d-3d6c-4fc6-9de9-1f9466682ad4-1
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:27.894
then on the right side she's
sitting there with the bottom

7946147d-3d6c-4fc6-9de9-1f9466682ad4-2
00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:30.110
half of the pointy pink hat.

5d0942ec-94c1-4b7f-9148-b41c94edc88f-0
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.153
And there's another painting of
somebody that's wearing it's a

5d0942ec-94c1-4b7f-9148-b41c94edc88f-1
00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:43.144
green painting to the left. It's
fairly large, so on that third

5d0942ec-94c1-4b7f-9148-b41c94edc88f-2
00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:47.902
floor, and it's somebody that
looks like they're playing the

5d0942ec-94c1-4b7f-9148-b41c94edc88f-3
00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:50.710
banjo or they're holding
something.

c1bce48d-c2e4-4203-8fd7-954df897c346-0
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.709
And they have a brown vest on
and a red handkerchief with a

c1bce48d-c2e4-4203-8fd7-954df897c346-1
00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.389
white hat and a blue bow tie
around the hat. And above that

c1bce48d-c2e4-4203-8fd7-954df897c346-2
00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.039
is a pink flower that is in.

5ad810b4-681a-4ad3-8ece-637ef9daf33e-0
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.520
What is the name? I'm thinking
of scalloped painting. It's like

5ad810b4-681a-4ad3-8ece-637ef9daf33e-1
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.354
a scalloped painting. Umm. And
then there are two big ladders

5ad810b4-681a-4ad3-8ece-637ef9daf33e-2
00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:24.955
that are on the 2nd floor that
are kind of surrounding the

5ad810b4-681a-4ad3-8ece-637ef9daf33e-3
00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:29.789
depiction of the picture that
says exhibit 12. And people are

5ad810b4-681a-4ad3-8ece-637ef9daf33e-4
00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.000
climbing up there and hanging
from there and they're.

53187d9e-adfd-4e5a-8773-b595faa3cd7e-0
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.740
All just looks like they're.

e0e290e1-a911-4505-8308-9352b6ed5978-0
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.877
Yeah, it looks like they're all
kind of painting that as well.

e0e290e1-a911-4505-8308-9352b6ed5978-1
00:04:43.877 --> 00:04:47.093
And then on the 2nd floor, it
looks like all the way to the

e0e290e1-a911-4505-8308-9352b6ed5978-2
00:04:47.093 --> 00:04:50.309
left, right below the shark. It
looks like there's a person

e0e290e1-a911-4505-8308-9352b6ed5978-3
00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:52.990
that's imprisoned and you can
tell from the bars.

e740ac69-80b2-48a6-8691-3db0feaf6e34-0
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.687
And they're holding on to them
like they're imprisoned.

e740ac69-80b2-48a6-8691-3db0feaf6e34-1
00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:57.260
#END_exhibit_12

7224ce01-b7e3-4a86-864c-7853ca29f146-0
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.824
Wait, that's about 5 minutes
ohh. OK, alright great. Moving

7224ce01-b7e3-4a86-864c-7853ca29f146-1
00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:05.400
on to the next one.

e87c1fa2-a0be-4aba-b4d4-2582e0b6f073-0
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.810
Again, when you're ready.

4f96ef63-4421-4935-8d5c-7280410d7636-0
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.148
#START_waldo_1 This just looks
like it's a town. In the middle

4f96ef63-4421-4935-8d5c-7280410d7636-1
00:05:18.148 --> 00:05:21.610
of the town is is In the
triangle there is a fountain

4f96ef63-4421-4935-8d5c-7280410d7636-2
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.700
that somebody is.

9f0ab84b-44f6-4d6f-82e7-ba47ea4adc41-0
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.066
Um, scuba diving in and they've
got a snorkel. They're

9f0ab84b-44f6-4d6f-82e7-ba47ea4adc41-1
00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:33.217
snorkeling in it and they have
flippers and they're both green,

9f0ab84b-44f6-4d6f-82e7-ba47ea4adc41-2
00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:38.368
and that's in the middle of the
Town Center. And there are cars

9f0ab84b-44f6-4d6f-82e7-ba47ea4adc41-3
00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:43.037
kind of all around. Directly
behind the fountain is a car

9f0ab84b-44f6-4d6f-82e7-ba47ea4adc41-4
00:05:43.037 --> 00:05:46.819
accident between a red car and a
yellow truck.

2abaf9be-2ef1-4331-92e7-0be775b50d0a-0
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.968
And you can tell from the smoke
that's coming out and the fact

2abaf9be-2ef1-4331-92e7-0be775b50d0a-1
00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:58.253
that they have bumped into each
other and then going further

2abaf9be-2ef1-4331-92e7-0be775b50d0a-2
00:05:58.253 --> 00:05:59.640
back, if you go.

7529887e-a653-4b12-bcf0-df89722d60a2-0
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.542
Back behind the red car there is
a green car that looks like it's

7529887e-a653-4b12-bcf0-df89722d60a2-1
00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:08.160
also being worked on. It looks
like it's kind of fallen apart

7529887e-a653-4b12-bcf0-df89722d60a2-2
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.320
and so it seems to be at a
mechanic.

fc4657c1-19e3-43a3-9401-3f5c497b8d42-0
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.453
Office or the mechanic and it's
getting worked on there and then

fc4657c1-19e3-43a3-9401-3f5c497b8d42-1
00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:22.560
if you come before the yellow
truck.

44ecb59a-c553-43c5-b3b7-2ed52b0871d9-0
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.198
There is somebody on a
motorcycle or it looks like a

44ecb59a-c553-43c5-b3b7-2ed52b0871d9-1
00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:30.882
snowmobile of some sort, right?
And there's a yellow truck and

44ecb59a-c553-43c5-b3b7-2ed52b0871d9-2
00:06:30.882 --> 00:06:34.624
then a blue car and almost in a
snowmobile of some of some kind

44ecb59a-c553-43c5-b3b7-2ed52b0871d9-3
00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:38.190
just kind of zooming about and
throughout the whole picture,

44ecb59a-c553-43c5-b3b7-2ed52b0871d9-4
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.879
people are meandering throughout
the streets.

2d7c920b-4bd6-4d40-b6b1-88e39a0b26d5-0
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.114
There is a farmers market of
some sort that appears to be

2d7c920b-4bd6-4d40-b6b1-88e39a0b26d5-1
00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:52.257
going on at the bottom of the
page and they there you can tell

2d7c920b-4bd6-4d40-b6b1-88e39a0b26d5-2
00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:57.155
from the various different
stands that there are as well as

2d7c920b-4bd6-4d40-b6b1-88e39a0b26d5-3
00:06:57.155 --> 00:07:01.400
the plants that are being sold,
the blue and white.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.258
Stand has several plants and
someone standing outside of

bf33bc6c-5934-46e4-9ef1-26becf2e0367-1
00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:06.570
them.

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-0
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.602
And then if you go above to the
left side of the page, there are

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-1
00:07:12.602 --> 00:07:17.025
two men or people that have
their they're cleaners, and they

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-2
00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:21.447
have turned their buckets into
hats and now they're fighting

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-3
00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:25.652
each other with their mops and
they're wearing their blue

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-4
00:07:25.652 --> 00:07:30.075
overalls. And then on the pink
house that is behind there, a

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-5
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:34.642
puppy or an animal of some sort
has escaped on the roof of the

888a25e9-3877-40e1-8712-c5f449f53899-6
00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:36.020
pink and Red House.

689c752f-55ed-4ad2-bd0b-ba92184c5a01-0
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.433
And a person is kind of climbing
all over the top of the roof,

689c752f-55ed-4ad2-bd0b-ba92184c5a01-1
00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:47.957
the red roof, in his white shirt
and Gray pants, and trying to

689c752f-55ed-4ad2-bd0b-ba92184c5a01-2
00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:53.481
get the puppy. And so he's it
looks like a little boy in a red

689c752f-55ed-4ad2-bd0b-ba92184c5a01-3
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:53.920
suit.

810b308f-add8-41bd-b374-d34d7bc30093-0
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.921
And meanwhile, the mom or wife
of some sort is has her head out

810b308f-add8-41bd-b374-d34d7bc30093-1
00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:02.150
the window and she's trying to
direct them to get the dog.

5bc6451e-4a96-4fa2-9a43-3dea97e3a112-0
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.094
And then behind the red, behind
the red and pink house, there is

5bc6451e-4a96-4fa2-9a43-3dea97e3a112-1
00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:14.844
it looks like a school. You can
tell from the several groups of

5bc6451e-4a96-4fa2-9a43-3dea97e3a112-2
00:08:14.844 --> 00:08:19.149
children that are all going and
there's a crossing guard.

6442f5cb-1f03-4c6d-873c-ee30e0ae3c14-0
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.817
And a person that is standing in
a Gray suit, kind of directing

6442f5cb-1f03-4c6d-873c-ee30e0ae3c14-1
00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:28.820
the children to go into the
school.

038acded-be9c-4c2a-b547-d02e74bc2cf2-0
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.378
And then next to that there is
also a bicycle. There's a bunch

038acded-be9c-4c2a-b547-d02e74bc2cf2-1
00:08:36.378 --> 00:08:37.980
of people on bikes.

ca7b7884-89e0-4935-8f15-e38d0d99abdb-0
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.430
And they are doing it looks like
they fell.

4e4d4d26-3301-4cde-9aa7-54da1a9a483b-0
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.128
Um, and now there are doctors
and ambulances and coming

4e4d4d26-3301-4cde-9aa7-54da1a9a483b-1
00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:51.430
towards them.

9977f03c-190c-4012-862a-94c3955d56c8-0
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.480
And.

3c6b0628-fb4a-470c-b1c3-3ea9dfa4ce5f-0
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.658
Yeah. Also at the beginning next
to, I'm just circling back, Next

3c6b0628-fb4a-470c-b1c3-3ea9dfa4ce5f-1
00:09:01.658 --> 00:09:05.533
to the fountain, there's a
statue of a soldier with a bow

3c6b0628-fb4a-470c-b1c3-3ea9dfa4ce5f-2
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.070
and arrow. #END_waldo_1

56bc4947-a020-435d-92ed-195b33ccb749-0
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.170
It's OK, you go to the next one.

ef72c609-9ca5-44ef-86d3-b1f88cffa4dc-0
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.360
Next one.

69c05535-61a7-4a1c-84d8-ba8a6066766c-0
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.856
It's part of a story. Again,
it's scribe what is happening

69c05535-61a7-4a1c-84d8-ba8a6066766c-1
00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:24.830
and what you see as we go
through this story and try to

69c05535-61a7-4a1c-84d8-ba8a6066766c-2
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.740
take between 10 and 15 minutes
to do so.

1a504286-404d-464e-ab84-c026ba898b09-0
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.720
OK.

1710fa96-b010-469f-a0b3-58f97c129087-0
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.627
#START_arrival_4 Umm, so someone
is. So man is getting ready.

1710fa96-b010-469f-a0b3-58f97c129087-1
00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:39.715
He's showering, he's shaving,
he's putting on his clothes and

1710fa96-b010-469f-a0b3-58f97c129087-2
00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:44.000
his dress shoes and he's getting
his money for the day. Grabbing

1710fa96-b010-469f-a0b3-58f97c129087-3
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.110
his hat and he opens up his map.

a77369a3-0eb1-44f8-8528-dd2d2d53ac3c-0
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:53.048
And he's taking his map and
getting ready to go out into the

a77369a3-0eb1-44f8-8528-dd2d2d53ac3c-1
00:09:53.048 --> 00:09:56.340
world, and next to him is a
little.

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-0
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.578
Shark fish, and it follows on
the heels of him as he goes into

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-1
00:10:02.578 --> 00:10:07.717
the city. He's reading the map
as he goes into the city and his

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-2
00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:12.454
shark pet is on hot on the
heels. And then it broadens out

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-3
00:10:12.454 --> 00:10:17.433
into the picture of the whole
city where there are boats that

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-4
00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:22.250
are flying like airplanes, kind
of through the air, and the

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-5
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.148
stops that they're all at look
like teepees almost. They are

d924c2fe-b5f2-4403-9fbd-5c79737d21fc-6
00:10:27.148 --> 00:10:27.470
all.

d887f4fa-36fc-4c4c-872e-ae95239cd52b-0
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.360
Kind of coming to a point and
they're very cylindrical. 

5fb62ddf-c127-4b2d-9277-2f32aececa4b-0
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.203
So the shark meets with a shark
pet meets a little owl bird, an

5fb62ddf-c127-4b2d-9277-2f32aececa4b-1
00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:43.527
owl Bunny, rabbit thing. Umm.
And so those they meet and he

5fb62ddf-c127-4b2d-9277-2f32aececa4b-2
00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:48.212
turns around to see who belongs
to and it belongs to this woman.

5fb62ddf-c127-4b2d-9277-2f32aececa4b-3
00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:52.898
And so he starts conversing with
her saying, do you know where I

5fb62ddf-c127-4b2d-9277-2f32aececa4b-4
00:10:52.898 --> 00:10:57.511
am? And she's showing him on the
map, showing him this is where

5fb62ddf-c127-4b2d-9277-2f32aececa4b-5
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:01.979
we are. Umm you need to buy a
ticket from some for something.

88a18ebf-c3f5-4eb6-aa83-ff878d9d81a7-0
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.022
And she shows him towards the
ticket booth and rings up the

88a18ebf-c3f5-4eb6-aa83-ff878d9d81a7-1
00:11:06.022 --> 00:11:10.358
phone number and pulls the lever
and it disposes out a ticket and

88a18ebf-c3f5-4eb6-aa83-ff878d9d81a7-2
00:11:10.358 --> 00:11:13.710
she notices that this is the
ticket that you need.

fa093831-9ab8-4d69-b7be-0601ec8d20f3-0
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.014
And um, she's showing him what's
on the ticket and he's looking

fa093831-9ab8-4d69-b7be-0601ec8d20f3-1
00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:24.574
at her and they're discussing
the ticket a little bit more.

fa093831-9ab8-4d69-b7be-0601ec8d20f3-2
00:11:24.574 --> 00:11:29.439
And she points up and says this
is how you get on to one of the

fa093831-9ab8-4d69-b7be-0601ec8d20f3-3
00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:34.379
boats that are floating through
the sky. And so he's standing on

fa093831-9ab8-4d69-b7be-0601ec8d20f3-4
00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:38.939
the edge and they're observing
the boats as the boat lowers

fa093831-9ab8-4d69-b7be-0601ec8d20f3-5
00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:39.320
into.

d9dd8d6a-8933-4d81-8986-1a5e095c3c80-0
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:46.773
The ground for people to get on
board so him and his shark pet,

d9dd8d6a-8933-4d81-8986-1a5e095c3c80-1
00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:50.930
they both go board and their
ticket gets.

bb95fa77-39e2-4d95-9672-dbb88595209a-0
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.446
Stamped by the ticket collector,
and he ushers them on board. So

bb95fa77-39e2-4d95-9672-dbb88595209a-1
00:11:57.446 --> 00:12:01.798
once they're on board, he's
talking to the woman a little

bb95fa77-39e2-4d95-9672-dbb88595209a-2
00:12:01.798 --> 00:12:05.250
bit more. The one with the the
Bunny owl and.

37c70fa2-8a26-474d-b029-0b1ada4c7f9e-0
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.525
Um, he's discussing like this is
who I'm looking for. I'm looking

37c70fa2-8a26-474d-b029-0b1ada4c7f9e-1
00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:11.440
for this child.

b505181a-b6d7-4ba4-a039-0f8903949f29-0
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.588
And he pulls out a picture and
it's a picture of a child that's

b505181a-b6d7-4ba4-a039-0f8903949f29-1
00:12:16.588 --> 00:12:20.832
gone missing. And and she says,
oh, me too, I'm also looking for

b505181a-b6d7-4ba4-a039-0f8903949f29-2
00:12:20.832 --> 00:12:24.619
a child that's gone missing. And
she pulls out a picture.

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-0
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.206
And it appears to be like a
missing child or a birth

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-1
00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:34.691
certificate of some kind, but it
has a child on it. And then

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-2
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:38.882
there's a it's a flashback
sequence of some kind because

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-3
00:12:38.882 --> 00:12:43.293
the child that she's holding the
picture of, it shows them.

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-4
00:12:43.293 --> 00:12:47.337
They're reading. They get
attacked by people that they

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-5
00:12:47.337 --> 00:12:51.895
don't know. We can't see their
face. So it's somebody that is

2a36add1-0956-4012-94f2-c2c46a433193-6
00:12:51.895 --> 00:12:56.159
stealing her book away, locking
it away. You cannot read.

2eeef5f0-80d4-423a-8b89-72d76f491623-0
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.327
The book you must shovel and do
hard labor and so they hand her

2eeef5f0-80d4-423a-8b89-72d76f491623-1
00:13:01.327 --> 00:13:06.266
a shovel and force her to make
coal, it looks like and shovel

2eeef5f0-80d4-423a-8b89-72d76f491623-2
00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:11.523
coal into the fire and just kind
of clean the grate and make sure

2eeef5f0-80d4-423a-8b89-72d76f491623-3
00:13:11.523 --> 00:13:14.550
that she's doing a lot of hard
labor.

7e5bca7f-5bb3-4d69-a7f6-259da0aa0b3b-0
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.382
And it's revealed that there are
several children that are doing

7e5bca7f-5bb3-4d69-a7f6-259da0aa0b3b-1
00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:28.415
this, and they're all
participating in this type of

7e5bca7f-5bb3-4d69-a7f6-259da0aa0b3b-2
00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:33.302
hard labor that is fueling coal
into a sort of factory system.

7e5bca7f-5bb3-4d69-a7f6-259da0aa0b3b-3
00:13:33.302 --> 00:13:37.957
And she cries and she wants to
escape. And so one night she

7e5bca7f-5bb3-4d69-a7f6-259da0aa0b3b-4
00:13:37.957 --> 00:13:42.766
uses her shovel to break out of
wherever they're keeping her.

7e5bca7f-5bb3-4d69-a7f6-259da0aa0b3b-5
00:13:42.766 --> 00:13:46.490
She sneaks out. She gets in and
takes her book.

f1940966-e7c7-4da0-bbce-5b4cf60ba78c-0
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:52.267
Back. And she runs away and she
runs towards the train station.

f1940966-e7c7-4da0-bbce-5b4cf60ba78c-1
00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:57.787
She hops onto an abandoned train
and sits there and takes off

f1940966-e7c7-4da0-bbce-5b4cf60ba78c-2
00:13:57.787 --> 00:14:00.280
into the night on the train.

577a5ff5-1332-41b8-a220-36a2ed2f85b6-0
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.318
So they're on board the boat and
they're looking out and

577a5ff5-1332-41b8-a220-36a2ed2f85b6-1
00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:11.481
observing the town, the village
that they're going through, and

577a5ff5-1332-41b8-a220-36a2ed2f85b6-2
00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:16.483
they're sitting on there. She's
pointing out different signs,

577a5ff5-1332-41b8-a220-36a2ed2f85b6-3
00:14:16.483 --> 00:14:21.324
thought the conductor, I'm
assuming, yells out that this is

577a5ff5-1332-41b8-a220-36a2ed2f85b6-4
00:14:21.324 --> 00:14:23.180
a stop for some people.

55cdd2e8-8510-47e0-b0dc-583cea70bbf8-0
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:30.921
And he shakes her the woman's
hand, the man and him and his

55cdd2e8-8510-47e0-b0dc-583cea70bbf8-1
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:36.707
shark pet get off. He looks up
and notices that he is now in

55cdd2e8-8510-47e0-b0dc-583cea70bbf8-2
00:14:36.707 --> 00:14:42.683
the city. There is a lizard with
an a sort with a bowl bowl of

55cdd2e8-8510-47e0-b0dc-583cea70bbf8-3
00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:48.374
fruits of some sort, and below
that there is more fruits in

55cdd2e8-8510-47e0-b0dc-583cea70bbf8-4
00:14:48.374 --> 00:14:53.875
little bowls and things. And
he's looking out over it and

55cdd2e8-8510-47e0-b0dc-583cea70bbf8-5
00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:54.350
just.

f25f4e84-ff02-417b-a18d-e9a4d79350be-0
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.340
observing it.

92c7da0f-0325-44ba-a3f5-3a9907ecb2f1-0
00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.440
And observing the city before
him.

45e72f62-cb61-46cc-a76a-4b55da51b9ea-0
00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:07.438
So they go through the city and
they're walking through city

45e72f62-cb61-46cc-a76a-4b55da51b9ea-1
00:15:07.438 --> 00:15:11.790
city, him and his shark pet and
they get to.

59bbd6c6-3713-4eaf-a91c-4a92c54725f9-0
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:19.570
{I'm trying is it a cross or
down? So yeah the two pages so

59bbd6c6-3713-4eaf-a91c-4a92c54725f9-1
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.520
this is on the right and then go
across and down.

4939b9c4-1776-4f5a-989a-e6eba8d3c77e-0
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.880
Alright, so go across and then.

30892426-5a1e-4daf-835c-83735eb96589-0
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:35.098
On each separate page, we'll go
from there. OK. Yeah. OK. OK.

30892426-5a1e-4daf-835c-83735eb96589-1
00:15:35.098 --> 00:15:37.060
Like I have been doing.}

fe7d5d65-0db7-472c-8860-d2ff1b3983f3-0
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.769
But so they're going through the
city and then he stops at a

fe7d5d65-0db7-472c-8860-d2ff1b3983f3-1
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:45.150
market. He's asking to buy
things.

01dab6d7-12c3-4364-a57c-37dae8137448-0
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.902
He's noticing that they have
several different they have, it

01dab6d7-12c3-4364-a57c-37dae8137448-1
00:15:51.902 --> 00:15:55.910
looks like, squid of some sort
and fish people are buying.

3de3f889-3ff5-42e5-ba6e-2bece41e715f-0
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.380
Food from little.

39191c10-2071-4276-a36b-443b1a418a06-0
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.860
Almost vending machine type of
things. People are observing

39191c10-2071-4276-a36b-443b1a418a06-1
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:13.856
different pets or variation of
fish to be sold and he's looking

39191c10-2071-4276-a36b-443b1a418a06-2
00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:20.039
around. He has a grocery list of
what he has to buy. So we see an

39191c10-2071-4276-a36b-443b1a418a06-3
00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:25.941
apple, milk, cheese, bread, fish
and potatoes of some sort and

39191c10-2071-4276-a36b-443b1a418a06-4
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:31.750
Umm his fish or his little pet
says look if we get this from.

21bd68b9-6d5c-419d-817f-eeed7a0d09e4-0
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.638
The vending machine and pull it
out. There are some type of

21bd68b9-6d5c-419d-817f-eeed7a0d09e4-1
00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:38.740
fruit. It looks like it looks
like a strawberry.

e4aa3e3e-3fe8-46a1-91e0-3dd8395e8e51-0
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.720
Looking on his list, he doesn't
see strawberries on it.

c049739e-c951-404f-84b0-178ceab03cf1-0
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.450
But.

5dd961a1-5071-48d7-9802-cdc89a78b460-0
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.577
He and but someone pulls it out
and says, do you want this? It's

5dd961a1-5071-48d7-9802-cdc89a78b460-1
00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:53.586
a little boy and his father.
They say, do you want the the

5dd961a1-5071-48d7-9802-cdc89a78b460-2
00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:57.528
strawberry? He says, no, I need
bread and I want it to be

5dd961a1-5071-48d7-9802-cdc89a78b460-3
00:16:57.528 --> 00:17:01.605
sliced. You can kind of tell
from the hand motion that he's

5dd961a1-5071-48d7-9802-cdc89a78b460-4
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:04.120
doing that he wants it to be cut
up.

6679e46e-e6fb-4c6a-9f4f-877884220688-0
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:10.058
Um, and so they say, OK, if you
press this button, it's going to

6679e46e-e6fb-4c6a-9f4f-877884220688-1
00:17:10.058 --> 00:17:14.713
give you bread. And so they're
moving to the buttons, you know,

6679e46e-e6fb-4c6a-9f4f-877884220688-2
00:17:14.713 --> 00:17:15.950
when you open it.

b243265a-11f0-4071-a68b-c797e16fa0e7-0
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:22.188
Umm. He hands him a gourd. So
he's handing him a gourd and the

b243265a-11f0-4071-a68b-c797e16fa0e7-1
00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:25.880
man looks at the gourd, gives it
a sniff.

e085e2f2-6645-4ff2-b7bc-9ef65c43b8fd-0
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:32.173
The little boy offers him a
basket to carry his groceries

e085e2f2-6645-4ff2-b7bc-9ef65c43b8fd-1
00:17:32.173 --> 00:17:37.510
in, and the father and little
boy kind of show him on his way.

8a3a4f86-fa21-455b-8967-7a3cd1891b32-0
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:49.178
And then they offer him a shrimp
of some sort and a magical corn.

8a3a4f86-fa21-455b-8967-7a3cd1891b32-1
00:17:49.178 --> 00:17:55.827
Or it's almost like a cornucopia
with light that comes out little

8a3a4f86-fa21-455b-8967-7a3cd1891b32-2
00:17:55.827 --> 00:18:02.275
speckles of light. The dad also
pulls off leaves and says these

8a3a4f86-fa21-455b-8967-7a3cd1891b32-3
00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:08.722
are very good. The little boys
holding a giant strawberry, they

8a3a4f86-fa21-455b-8967-7a3cd1891b32-4
00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:09.730
offer him.

aca05028-7e4d-4dec-a365-c3dcf8821fd9-0
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.670
Umm.

9018c541-b217-444f-9a63-1356626b2a56-0
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.530
A clam or octopus.

c271a03c-b7ef-4d87-848d-fc3f6d453416-0
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.870
A snake.

22bccf43-4a9c-4467-a6bd-30798eb88e1c-0
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.220
Like thing with the ball on the
end.

5e0a608c-7d29-4281-a89f-bc8232349435-0
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.090
There's also a.

3b4eb3d8-393b-42e7-98d4-8ac8c95fbaab-0
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.985
Another fish that kind of ribbed
on the side with scales that

3b4eb3d8-393b-42e7-98d4-8ac8c95fbaab-1
00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:36.370
stand up straight, almost like
hair follicles.

78c3e500-a4b2-43d7-8eda-68953f3c637f-0
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.996
And then there's a looks like a
zucchini. It's got a spiral or a

78c3e500-a4b2-43d7-8eda-68953f3c637f-1
00:18:44.996 --> 00:18:50.846
starred inside where not star
but there are six different

78c3e500-a4b2-43d7-8eda-68953f3c637f-2
00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:56.796
breaks kind of like a a pie
splitting split. It's when you

78c3e500-a4b2-43d7-8eda-68953f3c637f-3
00:18:56.796 --> 00:19:02.546
cut it the cross section of
almost put a pie cutting. It

78c3e500-a4b2-43d7-8eda-68953f3c637f-4
00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:07.690
looks like. Little boy's eating
the fruit. The man

0858307c-a301-43f1-8fe0-dc5195e011ca-0
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.618
tries the squash. They feed the
shark and at the end of it he's

0858307c-a301-43f1-8fe0-dc5195e011ca-1
00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:17.552
got a collection of goodies for
the grocery store. So the little

0858307c-a301-43f1-8fe0-dc5195e011ca-2
00:19:17.552 --> 00:19:22.259
boy whispers that he wants to
show the man something. The dad

0858307c-a301-43f1-8fe0-dc5195e011ca-3
00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:26.434
says why don't we show you
around towards the boat the

0858307c-a301-43f1-8fe0-dc5195e011ca-4
00:19:26.434 --> 00:19:31.217
little boy is pointing and they
take him into a harbor full of

0858307c-a301-43f1-8fe0-dc5195e011ca-5
00:19:31.217 --> 00:19:32.280
several boats.

03a8441c-d8ae-4272-a3ae-0e48c0d1f480-0
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.527
The little boy brings him over
and motions him over to a

03a8441c-d8ae-4272-a3ae-0e48c0d1f480-1
00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:42.520
particular boat with a.

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-0
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.832
It's just a vase, and the vase
has a tail that's peeking out

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-1
00:19:49.832 --> 00:19:54.251
from it. And so the man is
confused and he looks inside and

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-2
00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:58.892
then the tail starts to come out
more and then the man dropped

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-3
00:19:58.892 --> 00:20:03.753
his groceries. He's like, what's
going on? He's very disoriented,

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-4
00:20:03.753 --> 00:20:08.245
the man and the father that
reassures him. He says it's fine

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-5
00:20:08.245 --> 00:20:12.885
and out pops a dragon. It looks
like a dragon or a cat of some

d032e4e3-4cad-4b09-98fc-18cf1c87777d-6
00:20:12.885 --> 00:20:14.580
sort with a spiky tail.

24549d8f-25d9-43d3-802a-96f0e2417a01-0
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.956
And it's their pet. So little
boy holds the Dragon cat and the

24549d8f-25d9-43d3-802a-96f0e2417a01-1
00:20:19.956 --> 00:20:24.110
man meets him and says, What are
you? this is crazy.

e773c370-9ee0-4005-9b29-a4a5717c6ad7-0
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.249
And the shark pet, his shark
pet, and their dragon seemed to

e773c370-9ee0-4005-9b29-a4a5717c6ad7-1
00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:35.524
be kind of standing off against
one another, but they they don't

e773c370-9ee0-4005-9b29-a4a5717c6ad7-2
00:20:35.524 --> 00:20:40.474
seem to have any problems. So
the man picks up his groceries

e773c370-9ee0-4005-9b29-a4a5717c6ad7-3
00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:45.830
and he tells Umm he's talking to
the father and he's like, what's

e773c370-9ee0-4005-9b29-a4a5717c6ad7-4
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.780
going on? I have to I have to
draw this. And so he starts he

e773c370-9ee0-4005-9b29-a4a5717c6ad7-5
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.730
he breaks out the drawing and
you see a the Dragon cat tail.

bb93dc9b-5a34-437b-8f31-33e0d4be6c08-0
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.500
Kind of flying over.

627b236b-0e41-4c8c-8974-b31377595c18-0
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.510
The.

ffc64239-049b-43ba-ac82-f098ffbdece3-0
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.650
A bunch of houses and the man's
like, look at this, this is the

ffc64239-049b-43ba-ac82-f098ffbdece3-1
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.034
drawing that I have and the
father is taken aback. He's

ffc64239-049b-43ba-ac82-f098ffbdece3-2
00:21:12.034 --> 00:21:17.045
shocked. Um, but he looks up and
you kind of pin in on his face

ffc64239-049b-43ba-ac82-f098ffbdece3-3
00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:20.489
and he starts seeing flames.

8e3279ea-e543-4c50-a8e9-9978c7ba879e-0
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.723
OK, good. So that was the story.
That was good. That was really

8e3279ea-e543-4c50-a8e9-9978c7ba879e-1
00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:30.650
good. That was about 10-11
minutes.

a7dce7c5-ac60-402b-9b26-d153a6ae141c-0
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.380
OK, so for the next item, again
it is a story.

a47c68ed-0ca7-4591-af63-f9801c1760f5-0
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.424
Tell the story what you're what
you see and what is happening as

a47c68ed-0ca7-4591-af63-f9801c1760f5-1
00:21:42.424 --> 00:21:43.840
we go through the pages.

07432c8b-36d5-40c3-a549-4ff45edfca99-0
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.273
#START_flowerman So there is a
person who looks like a little

07432c8b-36d5-40c3-a549-4ff45edfca99-1
00:21:50.273 --> 00:21:55.469
old person with their dog. They
have a green jacket on, they've

07432c8b-36d5-40c3-a549-4ff45edfca99-2
00:21:55.469 --> 00:22:00.422
got their hat on. It appears to
be Halloween because it's an

07432c8b-36d5-40c3-a549-4ff45edfca99-3
00:22:00.422 --> 00:22:05.374
abandoned village, all Gray and
the sky is all purple. So it

07432c8b-36d5-40c3-a549-4ff45edfca99-4
00:22:05.374 --> 00:22:10.408
does appear to be a very spooky
we see the ravine is that the

07432c8b-36d5-40c3-a549-4ff45edfca99-5
00:22:10.408 --> 00:22:15.279
bridge is crossing over is
completely dried out. There are.

84b3b4b2-e5ce-43f0-b985-f7a4847573eb-0
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.356
Cars that have crashed into it,
there's boats that have been

84b3b4b2-e5ce-43f0-b985-f7a4847573eb-1
00:22:19.356 --> 00:22:22.390
sunk to the bottom. It's looking
pretty bleak.

d00aa345-eb22-4842-86e6-f9792c6fba0d-0
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.599
So this old person is walking
with their dog. They're

d00aa345-eb22-4842-86e6-f9792c6fba0d-1
00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:35.849
illuminated by the light of the
town. Besides the sky, They are

d00aa345-eb22-4842-86e6-f9792c6fba0d-2
00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:40.853
the only color in the entire
area. There's nobody really out

d00aa345-eb22-4842-86e6-f9792c6fba0d-3
00:22:40.853 --> 00:22:46.185
on the street. Somebody's riding
a motorcycle, but there's not a

d00aa345-eb22-4842-86e6-f9792c6fba0d-4
00:22:46.185 --> 00:22:47.580
lot of nightlife.

d0411ca3-45ca-4a94-ac42-b90face35d0f-0
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.230
And so he's just walking through
the village.

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-0
00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:02.282
And when he gets through the
village, he stops at a abandoned

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-1
00:23:02.282 --> 00:23:06.722
house. The House has a for sale
sign and that we can now see

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-2
00:23:06.722 --> 00:23:11.163
that this person has a bag of
luggage with them. We start to

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-3
00:23:11.163 --> 00:23:15.603
see more people. They're all
still Gray, so none of them are

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-4
00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:19.970
really doing anything. They're
all just kind of going about

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-5
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.337
their lives. Somebody seems to
be painting, a couple people

91564b9a-8e9b-442f-91c0-a7cd42c2363f-6
00:23:24.337 --> 00:23:24.919
seem to.

de9b6055-04fe-4c0d-82e4-1e9be05f360a-0
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.770
Look despondent next to the
fountain.

4a5a3c69-95eb-4c2e-8bda-27fb51e20324-0
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.275
But most of them are all just
inside of their house,

4a5a3c69-95eb-4c2e-8bda-27fb51e20324-1
00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:34.800
participating in their night.

81f01c0d-4a20-46e6-86ca-71b448a342fa-0
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:45.319
And as the days go by, this man
starts to bring some color into

81f01c0d-4a20-46e6-86ca-71b448a342fa-1
00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:50.524
the neighborhood. He starts
painting the house blue and

81f01c0d-4a20-46e6-86ca-71b448a342fa-2
00:23:50.524 --> 00:23:56.194
purple and has his lawn mower.
The grass looks really green.

81f01c0d-4a20-46e6-86ca-71b448a342fa-3
00:23:56.194 --> 00:24:02.329
Everything is still Gray. People
are still participating in their

81f01c0d-4a20-46e6-86ca-71b448a342fa-4
00:24:02.329 --> 00:24:03.910
daily lives. But.

3d3ae59b-6632-43e5-a466-1524c66d470e-0
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.336
He's bringing some color into it
and we really get that focal

3d3ae59b-6632-43e5-a466-1524c66d470e-1
00:24:08.336 --> 00:24:12.032
point of him as he starts to
rebuild this house that was once

3d3ae59b-6632-43e5-a466-1524c66d470e-2
00:24:12.032 --> 00:24:12.450
broken.

5c92ca87-bf15-4d61-a8cb-00a800056bd7-0
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.430
Umm.

3e3e4c71-9eb7-4be6-bdf5-8e12a56c70db-0
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.650
And then the man, the old man,
is planting.

a6950ba0-5fe1-434d-b89c-eebef864a242-0
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:32.309
And the house is in full bloom.
It's got a beautiful brightly

a6950ba0-5fe1-434d-b89c-eebef864a242-1
00:24:32.309 --> 00:24:39.709
colored orange tree of flowers.
The roof is fully purple with a

a6950ba0-5fe1-434d-b89c-eebef864a242-2
00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:42.600
multi colored fire place.

3c798926-c951-418c-9c83-01656f1bbb7a-0
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.164
his grass is really green, the
shutters are blue. And now we

3c798926-c951-418c-9c83-01656f1bbb7a-1
00:24:48.164 --> 00:24:52.067
see that he's not the only
person that is in color. There

3c798926-c951-418c-9c83-01656f1bbb7a-2
00:24:52.067 --> 00:24:56.238
is a little girl with red hair
and a yellow blouse and a blue

3c798926-c951-418c-9c83-01656f1bbb7a-3
00:24:56.238 --> 00:25:00.343
skirt, and she's walking the
streets and he's he's waving to

3c798926-c951-418c-9c83-01656f1bbb7a-4
00:25:00.343 --> 00:25:02.900
her, and everyone else is still
Gray.

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-0
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.835
Um, and slowly things are
starting to look a little bit

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-1
00:25:11.835 --> 00:25:16.449
more colored in in the village,
the little redheaded girl is now

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-2
00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:20.851
wearing the green jacket that
that old man once donned. There

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-3
00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:24.897
are more people that are
starting to have color there we

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-4
00:25:24.897 --> 00:25:29.369
see the red headed girl is with
another old man. Actually this

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-5
00:25:29.369 --> 00:25:33.700
is just a different red haired
child. But every there's more

13287660-4b09-4ce2-84e6-6cd2b39cd001-6
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.410
color now.

ec5581a0-49b2-46f0-a644-87b678edb980-0
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:39.640
We can start to see that there
are some red shutters that with

ec5581a0-49b2-46f0-a644-87b678edb980-1
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.344
multi colored shingles on the
roof and so this old man is

ec5581a0-49b2-46f0-a644-87b678edb980-2
00:25:44.344 --> 00:25:49.130
really starting to bring some
light. His face is looking a

ec5581a0-49b2-46f0-a644-87b678edb980-3
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.158
little Gray, but everybody else
is starting to really come to

ec5581a0-49b2-46f0-a644-87b678edb980-4
00:25:54.158 --> 00:25:57.160
life. We see, we see that
happening.

268f8479-83a2-4d7d-9ca5-8c16436a5128-0
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:07.100
So now, I mean the town is
pretty much fully in bloom with

268f8479-83a2-4d7d-9ca5-8c16436a5128-1
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.037
everything very col like multi
colored. The cars are now

268f8479-83a2-4d7d-9ca5-8c16436a5128-2
00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:17.493
colored with their orange, we
see the milk that there's a milk

268f8479-83a2-4d7d-9ca5-8c16436a5128-3
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:18.100
carton.

5aa681d9-b9bf-4e90-a9eb-9cd6d5857973-0
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.915
That delivery truck that's
coming by and has red lettering,

5aa681d9-b9bf-4e90-a9eb-9cd6d5857973-1
00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:26.220
people are dancing in the
street.

6407af9c-69fc-490e-beb8-f2743c9af931-0
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.640
Uh, they all

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-0
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.914
Are brought to life with color
and the man and his wife, I'm

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-1
00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:37.776
assuming, and their children are
grilling outside of their house,

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-2
00:26:37.776 --> 00:26:42.491
their little home, and you can
tell the impact. Everybody's out

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-3
00:26:42.491 --> 00:26:47.354
on the streets again and there's
really, you can see that they're

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-4
00:26:47.354 --> 00:26:51.701
not just doing what they're
doing in life and looking drab

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-5
00:26:51.701 --> 00:26:56.342
about it, but the person that
was once painting before now has

13562d3d-9a9c-4b2b-ace0-5436126aecd5-6
00:26:56.342 --> 00:26:57.890
become an artist and.

ed347a07-351a-4bf5-b5a1-a5bd08d9ac13-0
00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.955
The person that was just sitting
staring at their walls is now

ed347a07-351a-4bf5-b5a1-a5bd08d9ac13-1
00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:05.459
looking outdoors and engaged and
they're all really engaging with

ed347a07-351a-4bf5-b5a1-a5bd08d9ac13-2
00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:08.857
each other a lot more. A little
boy that was once really sad on

ed347a07-351a-4bf5-b5a1-a5bd08d9ac13-3
00:27:08.857 --> 00:27:11.300
the fountain is now playing in
the water, so.

7fc922e3-e4f6-42c5-ac4d-4ebe4f683c9a-0
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.290
 a lot happier.

d7723412-2cba-439f-acf6-91d05e126f83-0
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.490
Um, in night starts to fall
again.

9ca2dadf-b218-4187-8154-db6fb9c85308-0
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:30.059
The old man's leaving, packing
his bags. Everybody's out of the

9ca2dadf-b218-4187-8154-db6fb9c85308-1
00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:30.640
house.

d9a32657-790a-4c0c-b287-e31f00f3eb2c-0
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.360
Doing their

9dd207aa-1128-4d81-8a29-dbdeacbf18c1-0
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.965
Engaging in certain things. The
person that stared at the wall

9dd207aa-1128-4d81-8a29-dbdeacbf18c1-1
00:27:38.965 --> 00:27:43.444
is now on the rooftop doing who
knows what. There's a couple

9dd207aa-1128-4d81-8a29-dbdeacbf18c1-2
00:27:43.444 --> 00:27:48.069
that's up on the roof as well
that are snuggling and observing

9dd207aa-1128-4d81-8a29-dbdeacbf18c1-3
00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:52.621
the view. Umm, another old man
is looking on a telescope with

9dd207aa-1128-4d81-8a29-dbdeacbf18c1-4
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:54.090
two of the children.

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-0
00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.780
And the little girl who had the
green jacket from the old man,

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-1
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.670
she's now playing in the street
with other children and and so

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-2
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.129
everybody's just really
engaging. Everybody in the town

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-3
00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:11.834
is really engaging with one
another. And the fountain is in

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-4
00:28:11.834 --> 00:28:15.663
full bloom again. And it looks
like it's becoming dusk as the

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-5
00:28:15.663 --> 00:28:19.244
lights turn on and it becomes
night time. But the old man

e2e0353b-1bdd-41bf-94d4-50b531c86409-6
00:28:19.244 --> 00:28:20.480
seems to be leaving.

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-0
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.055
So he leaves, and again, there's
light in the village there.

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-1
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:33.374
Everything is still so colorful
and brought to life, and people

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-2
00:28:33.374 --> 00:28:37.759
seem really happy. You can see a
couple mingling in their window

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-3
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:41.808
next to the cafe. There's a
family out observing they're on

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-4
00:28:41.808 --> 00:28:45.789
on their roof, and he's he's
leaving the way he came, he's

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-5
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:50.040
walking back to town, and he's
getting ready to leave, the old

a8917f61-758d-4c40-b6ca-3b286ac15ae1-6
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.310
man.

daea16f2-9541-4b2b-8970-fcd7c44a3087-0
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.737
And and then it shows us back to
a flashback when he first bought

daea16f2-9541-4b2b-8970-fcd7c44a3087-1
00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:00.510
the house.

9480d860-9f68-4dad-8103-4e7c6d9220f0-0
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.450
He has a magical diamond.

b6fd95ed-b4cd-48bc-84de-b5544106e89c-0
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:10.670
I don't know what that is, but
he has some type of magical key

b6fd95ed-b4cd-48bc-84de-b5544106e89c-1
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.490
with him when he first arrived
to town.

99bfb5f6-189d-4691-b7ad-f2d4849324ff-0
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.213
And he's got his luggage and his
dog. But when he first got to

99bfb5f6-189d-4691-b7ad-f2d4849324ff-1
00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:22.670
the town, this is he had some
magical object.

073499a1-82eb-433b-9cd9-fb49f36e5cf2-0
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.380
And.

b298c7d9-4d87-4d4f-8400-c05854ac81d8-0
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:37.653
Maybe it was a flower, but he
gave it to this little girl that

b298c7d9-4d87-4d4f-8400-c05854ac81d8-1
00:29:37.653 --> 00:29:43.621
has a she's got her red jacket,
she's also in color and she's

b298c7d9-4d87-4d4f-8400-c05854ac81d8-2
00:29:43.621 --> 00:29:49.396
got her red jumper on and the
old another person that she's

b298c7d9-4d87-4d4f-8400-c05854ac81d8-3
00:29:49.396 --> 00:29:52.380
with, her father, I'm assuming.

2f8fa5df-e0d8-4cc5-99fa-aff0ca5a110b-0
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.068
he has a red bow tie. So he also
has a flower, and they both have

2f8fa5df-e0d8-4cc5-99fa-aff0ca5a110b-1
00:29:57.068 --> 00:30:00.742
flowers. She has a pink one, he
has a red one, and the old man

2f8fa5df-e0d8-4cc5-99fa-aff0ca5a110b-2
00:30:00.742 --> 00:30:04.124
is walking away, so maybe he
gave them flowers. They look

2f8fa5df-e0d8-4cc5-99fa-aff0ca5a110b-3
00:30:04.124 --> 00:30:07.739
really happy to have been given
something and they're both in

2f8fa5df-e0d8-4cc5-99fa-aff0ca5a110b-4
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:11.413
color, so that does give us a
hint as to the impact maybe has.

2f8fa5df-e0d8-4cc5-99fa-aff0ca5a110b-5
00:30:11.413 --> 00:30:12.230

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:20.258
OK. That was the story he could
sell and we can go on to the

7c92d510-267b-4639-a650-aefb0f38d144-1
00:30:20.258 --> 00:30:21.260
next item.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.730
And it's the story. Umm.

34bedf90-aee4-4484-ac7d-d0d7f7a8514a-0
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:25.900
So.

5998e410-8706-4d16-8164-02ebbbd910bf-0
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.156
Describe what you see and what
is happening as we go through

5998e410-8706-4d16-8164-02ebbbd910bf-1
00:30:31.156 --> 00:30:31.340
it.

e02030ed-0f8a-465d-a0a8-1655164c2da8-0
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:34.540
Sorry.

4b7ddcc0-2228-4850-bec9-9395f9243a6d-0
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:42.560
#START_quest So this is for
Darcy and we are.

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-0
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:48.460
Similar to the last story that
there was, there is, I think

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-1
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.209
this is a continuation because
there's the bike with the two

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-2
00:30:53.209 --> 00:30:58.191
wheels that the kids once drew.
It's a so they had drawn a red.

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-3
00:30:58.191 --> 00:31:02.939
There's a red tire and a pink
tire reflecting her red marker

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-4
00:31:02.939 --> 00:31:07.843
and his pink marker. He has his
pink bird on his shoulders and

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-5
00:31:07.843 --> 00:31:12.670
they're standing out in a park
under a bridge, taking shelter

b0660ba6-f696-42da-b3fd-018c2e8b11b7-6
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.760
from the rain.

31c7d8b1-bc69-4512-8b09-6b26e720c649-0
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:18.767
And they're watching this tree
as they oh not tree door as they

31c7d8b1-bc69-4512-8b09-6b26e720c649-1
00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:20.850
take shelter from the rain.

ecb7a9be-0cf3-4709-9aa6-ff66057a5a35-0
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.711
And out of the door comes a
magician with or a king or some

ecb7a9be-0cf3-4709-9aa6-ff66057a5a35-1
00:31:28.711 --> 00:31:33.603
type of maid with an orange
marker that has an orange crown,

ecb7a9be-0cf3-4709-9aa6-ff66057a5a35-2
00:31:33.603 --> 00:31:36.330
and they have an orange cloak
on.

8ec97f37-b1d4-477a-926c-8c3d7d0cf24c-0
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.516
Darcy and the boy with the pink
marker are both caught off

8ec97f37-b1d4-477a-926c-8c3d7d0cf24c-1
00:31:43.516 --> 00:31:48.847
guard. They're shocked. What's
going on? And he shows them a

8ec97f37-b1d4-477a-926c-8c3d7d0cf24c-2
00:31:48.847 --> 00:31:54.178
picture of it's a circle of a
green, blue, pink, red, orange

8ec97f37-b1d4-477a-926c-8c3d7d0cf24c-3
00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:55.140
and yellow.

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-0
00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.385
Collection of rings. And he's
he's pointing, he has his finger

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-1
00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:04.851
up to his lips, like don't tell
anybody, but he's showing them

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-2
00:32:04.851 --> 00:32:09.387
and he he gives it to them. And
as he's giving them his marker,

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-3
00:32:09.387 --> 00:32:13.711
his Satch, his satchel, and the
picture, he is taken away by

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-4
00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:17.893
guards. And so he dropped his
marker. They pick up his and

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-5
00:32:17.893 --> 00:32:22.358
they they take the guards, take
him away. And the girl and the

ddb4819c-9060-4942-9980-98a3161c34a0-6
00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:25.690
boy are left, and the marker is
on the ground.

b797562a-6da6-4f9b-9bf0-62765153545a-0
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.876
So they pick up his marker, they
put it in their stack, the

b797562a-6da6-4f9b-9bf0-62765153545a-1
00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:37.337
stachel that he gave them, and
they're thinking we have to go

b797562a-6da6-4f9b-9bf0-62765153545a-2
00:32:37.337 --> 00:32:41.869
after him. So she draws the key
and he draws the key, and they

b797562a-6da6-4f9b-9bf0-62765153545a-3
00:32:41.869 --> 00:32:46.186
both use their keys to unlock
the door, and they go through

b797562a-6da6-4f9b-9bf0-62765153545a-4
00:32:46.186 --> 00:32:49.280
the door and they take the bird
with them.

8d855515-096f-430f-a073-a46811bf4b4b-0
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:59.250
And then they come out into a
magical Kingdom. You we see the

8d855515-096f-430f-a073-a46811bf4b4b-1
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:05.629
Orange King being taken away on
a boat by a bunch of guards, we

8d855515-096f-430f-a073-a46811bf4b4b-2
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:11.909
can tell by his orange crown,
and they hide in a behind a rock

8d855515-096f-430f-a073-a46811bf4b4b-3
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:18.289
and they watch as he disappears.
But the Kingdom seems to be on

8d855515-096f-430f-a073-a46811bf4b4b-4
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:21.280
fire. There's fire everywhere.

49593bfc-c1f0-4383-ac71-244da1aa76b8-0
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.015
And there's smoke billowing out
from everywhere and people seem

49593bfc-c1f0-4383-ac71-244da1aa76b8-1
00:33:26.015 --> 00:33:28.730
to be needing to escape so could
be under attack.

4bd5c9d0-c2ce-41bb-a45a-cb51f76d3eed-0
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.975
And so they point. So they're
looking at the paper that he

4bd5c9d0-c2ce-41bb-a45a-cb51f76d3eed-1
00:33:35.975 --> 00:33:40.383
gave them as the Kingdom kind of
goes up in flames and it's a

4bd5c9d0-c2ce-41bb-a45a-cb51f76d3eed-2
00:33:40.383 --> 00:33:41.450
rainbow circle.

a13b3b16-33cd-4a97-8aa7-294e87f3c557-0
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.280
And each.

502d96cb-e8f6-40aa-8e6a-275a0a312514-0
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:53.093
Circle that is colored kind of
build off of 1 another to make a

502d96cb-e8f6-40aa-8e6a-275a0a312514-1
00:33:53.093 --> 00:33:59.219
complete rainbow. So the pink
Umm, and within and inside each

502d96cb-e8f6-40aa-8e6a-275a0a312514-2
00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:05.147
ring is a different place. The
pink marker came from a palm

502d96cb-e8f6-40aa-8e6a-275a0a312514-3
00:34:05.147 --> 00:34:10.680
tree. The red marker came from a
tree house with cages.

19f457d3-3e8f-4982-86ec-063141901fc7-0
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.596
Which we did see in the other
one, but she was in a cage and

19f457d3-3e8f-4982-86ec-063141901fc7-1
00:34:16.596 --> 00:34:21.033
then an orange. The Orange One
comes from the Kingdom and then

19f457d3-3e8f-4982-86ec-063141901fc7-2
00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:25.470
the yellow comes from underwater
type of situation underwater.

bf04d480-8edb-4b45-a61d-0e4d77dd8293-0
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.430
Kingdom.

b33e12c7-b136-4829-b65a-62c2813f50a0-0
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:37.273
I don't know what the green is.
It looks like a skyscraper with

b33e12c7-b136-4829-b65a-62c2813f50a0-1
00:34:37.273 --> 00:34:38.160
a bridge.

7d86dec4-4b42-4265-bdae-6443de987bd9-0
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.431
of some sort and lots of birds.
And then the blue looks like a

7d86dec4-4b42-4265-bdae-6443de987bd9-1
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:46.500
mountain, so they all connect to
one another.

e349a236-146c-4d4a-a303-b92054c9a875-0
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:47.830
Umm.

ce6c61ef-692b-45a7-ad67-0b16239281fe-0
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.140

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.350
Umm.

d5f68ed8-4b3b-42fb-bf99-8399ceab0a6f-0
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:59.626
So as so then they're spotted by
the man with the gold hat that

d5f68ed8-4b3b-42fb-bf99-8399ceab0a6f-1
00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:04.640
we had seen capture the pink
bird beforehand.

c1816977-db66-4349-b83d-52c6d71cbcdf-0
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.400
And in the last book he had
captured the pink bird. And so

c1816977-db66-4349-b83d-52c6d71cbcdf-1
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.889
they're they're spotted by him
and so like OK, we got to escape

c1816977-db66-4349-b83d-52c6d71cbcdf-2
00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:17.090
and they draw.

3b445c80-77dc-4ce6-9a8a-869efc871eba-0
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:24.820
Snorkels and flippers, and he
draws tentacles.

eb7f01c1-7a80-4380-be70-b29eb336ba5e-0
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.180
And.

7035c405-bcde-4f7a-a4d7-967600754cbb-0
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.430
Holds on to the tentacles of.
They both go into the water.

f826762c-71cc-49dc-a0ae-de0fbc1fa9da-0
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.624
Oh, he draws an octopus, and
they all go into the water and

f826762c-71cc-49dc-a0ae-de0fbc1fa9da-1
00:35:37.624 --> 00:35:39.290
hold on to the octopus.

94411c90-c4ee-44cd-93a5-467700f919ac-0
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:47.285
Um, they even the bird has
snorkel gear that's so cute. And

94411c90-c4ee-44cd-93a5-467700f919ac-1
00:35:47.285 --> 00:35:50.910
they're going down into the Umm.

b4250338-43b3-4410-ae86-2fe0e1709522-0
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:57.035
Underwater city to collect one
of the other rings that they

b4250338-43b3-4410-ae86-2fe0e1709522-1
00:35:57.035 --> 00:36:01.220
have to collect the next ring
they have to collect which

1aa42bba-5d01-4523-bb36-739219939953-0
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.594
Because they have the pink, the
orange and the red Now, so they

1aa42bba-5d01-4523-bb36-739219939953-1
00:36:05.594 --> 00:36:07.610
have to go and collect the
yellow.

66712e47-75d0-4f7a-81fb-a23026f78fc5-0
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:17.467
When they get down there, they
find the yellow marker. It's in

66712e47-75d0-4f7a-81fb-a23026f78fc5-1
00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:17.640
a.

91d14ff2-37f9-4bdf-9732-3acbd41a0fea-0
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.379
I believe it sits on a, sea,
it's on a seahorse sculpture, so

91d14ff2-37f9-4bdf-9732-3acbd41a0fea-1
00:36:22.379 --> 00:36:25.671
they pick it up, she puts in her
sacks, but they're being

91d14ff2-37f9-4bdf-9732-3acbd41a0fea-2
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:29.304
followed by the person with the
gold, the gold snorkel warrior,

91d14ff2-37f9-4bdf-9732-3acbd41a0fea-3
00:36:29.304 --> 00:36:32.994
the Gold Warrior. I'm just don't
even know what to call him. But

91d14ff2-37f9-4bdf-9732-3acbd41a0fea-4
00:36:32.994 --> 00:36:36.627
they're being followed. And so
they spot them. So they're like,

91d14ff2-37f9-4bdf-9732-3acbd41a0fea-5
00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:40.259
OK, we have to get out of here,
we have to go get the next one.

df64527d-295b-4cde-b4cd-02faf38a7bee-0
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.907
So, but they they have the
yellow marker now, they come out

df64527d-295b-4cde-b4cd-02faf38a7bee-1
00:36:44.907 --> 00:36:48.511
on the land and they immediately
start to draw their next

df64527d-295b-4cde-b4cd-02faf38a7bee-2
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:52.238
getaway, which looks to be some
type of animal that they'll

df64527d-295b-4cde-b4cd-02faf38a7bee-3
00:36:52.238 --> 00:36:52.860
escape on.

5927763e-ce70-458d-bacf-8237b0fd132d-0
00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.070
And it's a rhinoceros.

c103cee4-0f3a-42de-8b5d-bcde1f42ff05-0
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.880
And so they have they take the
rhinoceros.

f229c7fb-c575-48dc-b0a6-2ecf2a3c4d87-0
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.153
Um, into. To get to the next
marker, which again is at the

f229c7fb-c575-48dc-b0a6-2ecf2a3c4d87-1
00:37:09.153 --> 00:37:14.269
top of a high tower, you have to
cross a really rickety bridge to

f229c7fb-c575-48dc-b0a6-2ecf2a3c4d87-2
00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:14.580
get.

00e5263e-5ed0-439e-8592-97a97fc5ebc4-0
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:20.568
So their rhinoceros starts to
take them there and takes them

00e5263e-5ed0-439e-8592-97a97fc5ebc4-1
00:37:20.568 --> 00:37:25.849
through this jungle with all of
these ruins of pyramids and

00e5263e-5ed0-439e-8592-97a97fc5ebc4-2
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:26.290
such.

94ec17ea-3cb1-40e3-b4c5-b1eff282f04e-0
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:27.720
So yeah.

8bea9666-a331-42c3-9a7d-4953cf95da3c-0
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.310
So then they cross the bridge
and they go to get.

2ef4652e-1859-436a-b46b-c894a06b9016-0
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.990
They crossed the bridge to go
get the ye, the green. We can

2ef4652e-1859-436a-b46b-c894a06b9016-1
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.870
see the green marker is at the
top of.

724c2912-f5d4-4e81-8853-3213ddad3e18-0
00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:50.330
Appear of that skyscraper. It's
glowing. The bird is in pursuit

724c2912-f5d4-4e81-8853-3213ddad3e18-1
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.746
and they're just crossing the
bridge to go get it over this

724c2912-f5d4-4e81-8853-3213ddad3e18-2
00:37:54.746 --> 00:37:55.630
really deep.

ac48079f-25ac-447c-9a79-9a16e5d6182e-0
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.870
Water, yeah, far drop.

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-0
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.638
And once they get to the green
marker, they realize they're

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-1
00:38:06.638 --> 00:38:10.715
still being pursued by the
Warriors, that they are trying

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-2
00:38:10.715 --> 00:38:15.074
to capture them as well. Now
they have the pink, orange, red,

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-3
00:38:15.074 --> 00:38:19.573
green, yeah, and green markers.
So they only have one more left

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-4
00:38:19.573 --> 00:38:23.510
to go, I believe. And so they
start to build their next

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-5
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.588
getaway path, which looks like
it could. It's going to be

d7008927-a3e4-4f4a-9732-afde7956ad6f-6
00:38:27.588 --> 00:38:28.010
wings.

0e6b6aba-9757-487b-a5d2-c1c026c1a677-0
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.570
And it's a giant.

9e88d732-7fbc-4fb6-ae89-f7ad4230ac79-0
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:40.296
oh my god what insect is that,
oh that's a dragonfly. There is

9e88d732-7fbc-4fb6-ae89-f7ad4230ac79-1
00:38:40.296 --> 00:38:44.454
a dragonfly and they swing on
the dragonfly as the guards

9e88d732-7fbc-4fb6-ae89-f7ad4230ac79-2
00:38:44.454 --> 00:38:48.541
reach to get them and they
missed them just in time, but

9e88d732-7fbc-4fb6-ae89-f7ad4230ac79-3
00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:52.986
the dragonfly starts to take
them towards the mountain top to

9e88d732-7fbc-4fb6-ae89-f7ad4230ac79-4
00:38:52.986 --> 00:38:54.420
get the last marker.

497a1b17-5841-4a99-b189-aa599baa84b9-0
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.950
This is good.

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-0
00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.628
When they get to the top,
they're still in being pursued

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-1
00:39:01.628 --> 00:39:06.068
by the guards. It seems to be
this temple type of situation.

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-2
00:39:06.068 --> 00:39:10.581
And at the top is a blue marker.
And so they collect the blue

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-3
00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:15.021
marker, and then they have all
of the colors of the markers.

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-4
00:39:15.021 --> 00:39:19.388
They have every single one of
them. They have a pink, blue,

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-5
00:39:19.388 --> 00:39:24.046
green, yellow, orange and red,
in that order, and they have all

2336d50d-90a7-48ba-8694-1cdc0037c89b-6
00:39:24.046 --> 00:39:24.920
the markers.

6d946bd8-b162-49e6-beb3-129ce9f5bdea-0
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.280
Umm.

7b5f0165-7006-4f73-bd8e-f203d189c9af-0
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.034
And then at the last minute, the
bird takes the satchel and the

7b5f0165-7006-4f73-bd8e-f203d189c9af-1
00:39:35.034 --> 00:39:40.278
guards try to reach for the bird
to capture the bird. The and

7b5f0165-7006-4f73-bd8e-f203d189c9af-2
00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:45.270
they don't know what to do, they
don't have their markers.

44a8904b-1081-4955-a441-aaf868f6f964-0
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:52.204
oh no, so they're coming in on
these blimps. There's the guards

44a8904b-1081-4955-a441-aaf868f6f964-1
00:39:52.204 --> 00:39:55.730
as they're reaching for the pink
bird, they.

7c47f97f-55f3-4dfd-a314-66f8778a1f93-0
00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:00.985
The pink bird has the satchel
and they're all going for it.

7c47f97f-55f3-4dfd-a314-66f8778a1f93-1
00:40:00.985 --> 00:40:02.800
They have a cage in the hand.

23f508ec-0377-47fc-9ff3-61eb50fb549a-0
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:12.407
All of a sudden out from the
markers pop like Rainbow that

23f508ec-0377-47fc-9ff3-61eb50fb549a-1
00:40:12.407 --> 00:40:14.620
knock all of the guards.

52764aad-9dba-49c3-bcf3-762e1568d3fe-0
00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.324
It's so powerful it knocks all
of their blimp sideways and they

52764aad-9dba-49c3-bcf3-762e1568d3fe-1
00:40:20.324 --> 00:40:25.191
all go full flying out of it and
the bird is holding on to the

52764aad-9dba-49c3-bcf3-762e1568d3fe-2
00:40:25.191 --> 00:40:28.049
satchel as it flies through the
sky.

96855458-f5ef-4d9c-ba3c-436e993657e4-0
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:37.156
And this rainbow is so bright
that it goes all the way through

96855458-f5ef-4d9c-ba3c-436e993657e4-1
00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:38.940
the Kingdom and hit.

fa28cb7f-6b13-4443-a63e-d4ee3d37650f-0
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:45.540
The boat where the Orange King
was being held captive and.

e18dddad-0ccf-40f8-a637-99411caab3c6-0
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:50.679
He's rejoicing as the guards are
knocked off of it and even some

e18dddad-0ccf-40f8-a637-99411caab3c6-1
00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:54.354
of the people. Maybe they were
also captured, but pretty

e18dddad-0ccf-40f8-a637-99411caab3c6-2
00:40:54.354 --> 00:40:58.286
celebratory, but the guards have
all been knocked off by the

e18dddad-0ccf-40f8-a637-99411caab3c6-3
00:40:58.286 --> 00:40:59.640
power of the rainbow.

73b8c930-a84f-4721-86ff-92392a4d2621-0
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.436
And throughout the entire
Kingdom we see the rainbow has

73b8c930-a84f-4721-86ff-92392a4d2621-1
00:41:09.436 --> 00:41:14.515
lit everything up. There is a
parade going through the village

73b8c930-a84f-4721-86ff-92392a4d2621-2
00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:18.870
now where we see the octopus
that helps them get the.

6db2a557-3c54-4f7e-998d-b3eeb320cbe7-0
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.427
Yellow marker, the rhinoceros
that helped them get the green

6db2a557-3c54-4f7e-998d-b3eeb320cbe7-1
00:41:24.427 --> 00:41:28.359
marker that the little boy, the
little girl in the king are all

6db2a557-3c54-4f7e-998d-b3eeb320cbe7-2
00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:30.510
riding on as it flows through
the.

9364bd7c-0ad2-484a-9c12-298019a1a6cc-0
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:35.678
aqueduct. We see the dragonfly
floating in the sky, and our

9364bd7c-0ad2-484a-9c12-298019a1a6cc-1
00:41:35.678 --> 00:41:39.502
bird and the rainbow has lit
everything up and restored

9364bd7c-0ad2-484a-9c12-298019a1a6cc-2
00:41:39.502 --> 00:41:42.030
everything back to its former
power.

8355a644-fde0-4b14-85b5-79a472e3faca-0
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:50.133
And so then when they get to the
landing, the king is very

8355a644-fde0-4b14-85b5-79a472e3faca-1
00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:54.621
grateful for them. He draws them
their own little crowns of

8355a644-fde0-4b14-85b5-79a472e3faca-2
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:58.810
orange and sends them back
through, and he places it on

8355a644-fde0-4b14-85b5-79a472e3faca-3
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:03.223
their head as they kneel down.
And then he sends them back

8355a644-fde0-4b14-85b5-79a472e3faca-4
00:42:03.223 --> 00:42:04.720
through the doorway.

f98ee5f4-79fc-40c5-ad83-ee792f5c14e7-0
00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:06.210
OK.

eb1f74de-5370-40d0-a19b-4ed54ec57e20-0
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.967
And as they stand in the
doorway, they realize that it's

eb1f74de-5370-40d0-a19b-4ed54ec57e20-1
00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:16.274
stopped raining and a rainbow
has come over the city. And they

eb1f74de-5370-40d0-a19b-4ed54ec57e20-2
00:42:16.274 --> 00:42:20.581
watched the rainbow, and they're
reminded of their just recent

eb1f74de-5370-40d0-a19b-4ed54ec57e20-3
00:42:20.581 --> 00:42:23.180
adventure with their bird.
#END_quest

3e422baf-4e8a-4b95-b156-e376b500737f-0
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.780
OK, that was good.

3e54552d-f125-408e-8c4d-76f16c70c499-0
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.600
We'll do one more item and then
we'll take a break, alright?

79eeccf2-ad1a-4367-b751-ef3776926d9b-0
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.520
Alright.

fd0d6cac-bce5-4e25-b0fb-c2f8a6c71823-0
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.750
#START_unfriendly_giants So this
is the land of the Giants.

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-0
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.608
We see that all of them are just
giant people in relativity to

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-1
00:42:49.608 --> 00:42:54.675
the tinier people that we see
kind of scattered around. There

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-2
00:42:54.675 --> 00:42:59.088
are giants that are playing
chess with little people,

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-3
00:42:59.088 --> 00:43:03.338
regular sized people, I'm
assuming. And we see that

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-4
00:43:03.338 --> 00:43:08.487
because of the patterned yellow
and blue markings of the chess

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-5
00:43:08.487 --> 00:43:12.818
board and the way that the
people are positioned and

fecd304e-01db-43ec-851d-e6b3337f5bbb-6
00:43:12.818 --> 00:43:14.779
they're grabbing people.

1a4ac4b9-aeff-4df6-b243-b58c49b095f2-0
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:20.684
As they need pawns from people
around them and you kind of tell

1a4ac4b9-aeff-4df6-b243-b58c49b095f2-1
00:43:20.684 --> 00:43:26.134
from the hand motions that
they're portraying, there's also

1a4ac4b9-aeff-4df6-b243-b58c49b095f2-2
00:43:26.134 --> 00:43:28.860
giants that are drinking lake.

a36a6dd0-1c9d-4dc5-ab19-d8e87f08d941-0
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.586
Umm, they have straws as they're
sucking up the lake and then one

a36a6dd0-1c9d-4dc5-ab19-d8e87f08d941-1
00:43:34.586 --> 00:43:37.610
of them is spitting it back onto
people?

23890c61-2cdf-44c9-8b71-559c19f1e629-0
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:44.861
There are then there is another
giant that's offering flowers to

23890c61-2cdf-44c9-8b71-559c19f1e629-1
00:43:44.861 --> 00:43:49.124
what appears to be a giant
scarecrow woman. Or like a

23890c61-2cdf-44c9-8b71-559c19f1e629-2
00:43:49.124 --> 00:43:53.861
giant, almost like a Trojan
horse situation. She appears to

23890c61-2cdf-44c9-8b71-559c19f1e629-3
00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:58.518
be wooden and behind her as a
giant mallet to smash on the

23890c61-2cdf-44c9-8b71-559c19f1e629-4
00:43:58.518 --> 00:43:59.940
head of the Giant.

796e4da9-e6c9-4bd0-a8c1-3387181b64d5-0
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.830
And so there are people all
around them.

5d756363-4aa7-4ee2-b794-fda4169361c4-0
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.910
Using that to capture.

86b02f8a-7185-4945-89be-f9fae68b4080-0
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.480
The.

313afe90-6dc3-4cc4-a79c-e83a46be0521-0
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.385
Well, and then there's another
giant that seems to be playing a

313afe90-6dc3-4cc4-a79c-e83a46be0521-1
00:44:12.385 --> 00:44:16.430
trick on all those people and
has a rope wrapped around them.

ca5895c1-aaa9-4cb4-b453-1df921533ca8-0
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.810
Um, and around the.

b80f87e5-a946-470d-b046-c039317eac59-0
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.670
And.

31d8c7ba-fe94-47c5-bdde-aacbcab566a2-0
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.638
There's another giant that has
another rope wrapped around him

31d8c7ba-fe94-47c5-bdde-aacbcab566a2-1
00:44:24.638 --> 00:44:26.480
and he's dragging people
throughout the.

ec8e128c-5a73-4265-85b6-c4f7ede91bb0-0
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:28.660
The scene.

20818c7b-2cc9-4dad-876f-b8689180df42-0
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.600
as they're attached to the back
of him.

1e5d0c81-657b-4d8c-9a32-7581859bed5a-0
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.465
And then we see another giant
woman or a giant man that's also

1e5d0c81-657b-4d8c-9a32-7581859bed5a-1
00:44:37.465 --> 00:44:41.642
attracted to this giant woman
Trojan horse. She's wearing her

1e5d0c81-657b-4d8c-9a32-7581859bed5a-2
00:44:41.642 --> 00:44:45.752
red blouse and her blue skirt,
and she has another hammer as

1e5d0c81-657b-4d8c-9a32-7581859bed5a-3
00:44:45.752 --> 00:44:49.660
well. And then in the back we
see Giants going toward the

1e5d0c81-657b-4d8c-9a32-7581859bed5a-4
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.029
Kingdom. They're going to go
step on the Kingdom.

a147e3a3-0acd-497f-b842-dd322f1a41eb-0
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.530
And.

9261cff4-abd9-46e9-847a-bec4511a81b0-0
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.580
Cause chaos.

9e9aa195-ee08-4d64-b81d-7da4f4bdc02f-0
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.946
Over there and there we see
little people coming out of

9e9aa195-ee08-4d64-b81d-7da4f4bdc02f-1
00:45:02.946 --> 00:45:06.840
there. There's a windmill that
giants are. There's a giant

9e9aa195-ee08-4d64-b81d-7da4f4bdc02f-2
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.140
that's spinning the windmill
over and over again.

d1a354eb-c24b-4ee1-8938-f187ccce6bc5-0
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:15.682
And throughout the entire scene
there are several different

d1a354eb-c24b-4ee1-8938-f187ccce6bc5-1
00:45:15.682 --> 00:45:16.600
Trojan horses.

3505e0ef-ba6e-48f3-bd5b-d5f41947529f-0
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:28.080
Women scarecrows for the human
to bong the giants and.

6025463b-8047-4a41-81e7-b31e98775429-0
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.933
They're just harassing all of
the people and we can see from

6025463b-8047-4a41-81e7-b31e98775429-1
00:45:32.933 --> 00:45:37.212
the Kingdom as they March up to
them to go and capture some of

6025463b-8047-4a41-81e7-b31e98775429-2
00:45:37.212 --> 00:45:37.960
the people.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.590
Trying to see what else.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.670
There is.

00:45:54.808 --> 00:45:57.640
some trees next to the village.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.845
There are trees around that
people are hiding in, and the

2632046d-2f58-432a-9359-a4ec8c52976b-1
00:46:02.845 --> 00:46:06.530
giant is kind of climbing over
to go kidnap those people.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.906
They're also stepping over the
ravine that is separating the

7bec47e9-0c67-4378-b20a-fb69078a3cc5-1
00:46:12.906 --> 00:46:13.490

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.418
From people like the Giants and
the people, they're just

nothing.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:38.190
Various different scarves around
their neck.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.560
Um, with different types of
tunics.

playing the chess.

c358bd26-feea-4fc5-ac4b-ce153d1d9a1e-0

out of the way or grabbing them

c358bd26-feea-4fc5-ac4b-ce153d1d9a1e-2

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.874
#START_airport So this is an
airport scene. We can kind of

ee62b6fb-3778-43e6-a54f-d971a40486cc-1
00:47:29.874 --> 00:47:34.728

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.620
There's a group of people that
are smoking around the luggage,

22860954-82fb-4681-9581-2036e985595c-1
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.906

the luggage, just kind of

810fde36-1dd2-4686-aeec-a619e4a9ccb8-0

The pilots are standing on the

00:48:30.404 --> 00:48:34.178
and going around. There are
people that are waiting to get

25e29936-4323-486f-8342-c8ee6b21bff6-2
00:48:34.178 --> 00:48:34.690
tickets.

b6afbb5b-9baa-4087-bece-c631372e6f0f-0
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:41.820
Um, and looks like the TSA line
where they're throwing out like.

1bef9e43-e8fd-4e80-b6e4-578cf562017e-0
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:48.195
All sorts of stuff. And it's
hitting the other TSA members.

1bef9e43-e8fd-4e80-b6e4-578cf562017e-1
00:48:48.195 --> 00:48:53.301
There's another person that he
got stripped down or got his

1bef9e43-e8fd-4e80-b6e4-578cf562017e-2
00:48:53.301 --> 00:48:58.832
opened up his jacket and they're
like 12 knives. Umm, so kind of

1bef9e43-e8fd-4e80-b6e4-578cf562017e-3
00:48:58.832 --> 00:49:01.130
going through TSA and then.

1c954acd-35de-4ccb-a209-9522e0113ca4-0
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:09.063
Uh, there's also a you look over
and there are people checking

1c954acd-35de-4ccb-a209-9522e0113ca4-1
00:49:09.063 --> 00:49:11.360
bags onto the plane.

a444024e-687d-4f29-9fb3-0d344a69175a-0
00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:17.286
And then we see one of the
planes as well, the farthest to

a444024e-687d-4f29-9fb3-0d344a69175a-1
00:49:17.286 --> 00:49:21.862
the right. The stairs were not
moved over because one of the

a444024e-687d-4f29-9fb3-0d344a69175a-2
00:49:21.862 --> 00:49:26.588
employees was talk was talking
or something. And so people are

a444024e-687d-4f29-9fb3-0d344a69175a-3
00:49:26.588 --> 00:49:30.864
just falling out of the plane
onto the runway. There's a

a444024e-687d-4f29-9fb3-0d344a69175a-4
00:49:30.864 --> 00:49:31.690
really old.

80c1a8e3-78c9-4f7e-8cae-58a2a36e296f-0
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:38.450
Wooden plane with a ace of
spades card in the pilot center.

bf27734f-83f5-46ba-b670-c3acb8089b1e-0
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:45.488
Um. And then there's one plane
where the front, the nose of the

bf27734f-83f5-46ba-b670-c3acb8089b1e-1
00:49:45.488 --> 00:49:48.540
plane has completely opened up.

9b091783-e59a-488e-bfa0-d853c029eb1d-0
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.440
And the pilots are standing
there.

667ce8ca-5fef-4f43-be85-6afecb16fbf5-0
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.260
And then there is a blimp.

bf2bc296-105c-46db-891c-ea25ec879c11-0
00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:00.409
Um, there are. There's also an
airplane that has Eagles wings

bf2bc296-105c-46db-891c-ea25ec879c11-1
00:50:00.409 --> 00:50:02.490
that's flying through the air.

497da895-8769-4ddc-8097-0add0378b7a9-0
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.632
There is a hot air balloon
that's being filled up with hot

497da895-8769-4ddc-8097-0add0378b7a9-1
00:50:07.632 --> 00:50:07.900
air.

f8966539-e72a-4f6d-814a-b69be9c4cd64-0
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.080
There's another.

ba125cf5-e6dc-4767-b764-b3673081a86b-0
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:13.090
It's kind of old.

83692aee-234d-48f9-a469-96e11e1e8885-0
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.330
Tech plane that has the two
wings at the top and the bottom

83692aee-234d-48f9-a469-96e11e1e8885-1
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:23.000
and it's flying through the air
and it's red. It's right next to

83692aee-234d-48f9-a469-96e11e1e8885-2
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.670
the blimp. There's a rocket ship
and a UFO to the farthest right

83692aee-234d-48f9-a469-96e11e1e8885-3
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:31.909
of the page. The rocket ship is
flying right above command

83692aee-234d-48f9-a469-96e11e1e8885-4
00:50:31.909 --> 00:50:36.579
central and or the furthest left
and the UFO is also next to one

83692aee-234d-48f9-a469-96e11e1e8885-5
00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:40.100
of the other planes as it flies
through the air.

5ec55353-c3b5-4805-821d-1fd261a759f4-0
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.130
Umm. And then there are
elephants that are being boarded

5ec55353-c3b5-4805-821d-1fd261a759f4-1
00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:50.490
onto one of the planes all the
way up the back.

c4080013-f68e-48a5-a114-4e1b4048fc62-0
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.800
And.

96c95f82-1136-4588-a3d0-bba13812c318-0
00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:00.028
There are several different
flags that are near the

96c95f82-1136-4588-a3d0-bba13812c318-1
00:51:00.028 --> 00:51:03.928
helicopter. It looks like the
French flag is about to be

96c95f82-1136-4588-a3d0-bba13812c318-2
00:51:03.928 --> 00:51:06.050
chopped down by the helicopter.

5c9d8a05-1f95-407d-bfa5-0dd9ffa0923e-0
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.805
There is an American flag, a
British flag, a German flag,

5c9d8a05-1f95-407d-bfa5-0dd9ffa0923e-1
00:51:10.805 --> 00:51:14.657
Italian flag, a French flag, and
several of them have been

5c9d8a05-1f95-407d-bfa5-0dd9ffa0923e-2
00:51:14.657 --> 00:51:16.550
knocked over by a helicopter.

84993313-fad2-41cf-862d-5326c97cf7d1-0
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.404
There are. There's a tractor
trailer that is carrying people

84993313-fad2-41cf-862d-5326c97cf7d1-1
00:51:22.404 --> 00:51:23.790
and animals and cows.

8b6e7974-3f15-4c11-90fa-f5f40e5b9144-0
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.700
and it pulls uh people and their
luggage through the.

e3b4e4c0-cef7-47c7-b6b0-d4666f3007b7-0
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:30.290
Umm.

6b9a509f-f38b-4776-81d2-31f03684926c-0
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:33.520
Runway area.

a7294cb8-9f11-450e-b853-d0c3ff385fde-0
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:39.407
Um, there are people that are
boarding a bus that will take

a7294cb8-9f11-450e-b853-d0c3ff385fde-1
00:51:39.407 --> 00:51:41.040
them to their plane.

b0321d25-4a11-419b-b91c-f90e8286d34f-0
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:45.335
Blue bus that you can tell
they're all getting on to the

b0321d25-4a11-419b-b91c-f90e8286d34f-1
00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.070
plane. They all have their
luggage.

bb081bd7-935a-4781-9cf2-fd57ee274e21-0
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:52.976
And that's pretty typical. There
are cars that are carts that are

bb081bd7-935a-4781-9cf2-fd57ee274e21-1
00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:57.374
yellow. They're charting around
the luggage as they kind of go

bb081bd7-935a-4781-9cf2-fd57ee274e21-2
00:51:57.374 --> 00:51:58.980
around the runway area.

7be7c07e-e048-4514-acbd-51e155ee33e9-0
00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:02.140
And.

cc30fd0d-93ca-42d5-8c09-3ab568a6f7d9-0
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.480
All of the employees are all
wearing blue.

434fac36-4f8b-4cc5-8fcd-82444aa12eb3-0
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.621
And so that is usually that's
the distinguisher between them

434fac36-4f8b-4cc5-8fcd-82444aa12eb3-1
00:52:11.621 --> 00:52:14.994
and the other pedestrians that
are walking throughout.

434fac36-4f8b-4cc5-8fcd-82444aa12eb3-2
00:52:14.994 --> 00:52:15.730
#END_airport

dd784176-9667-4bf3-9cc6-1c8c109b3215-0
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:23.236
OK, that's about 5 minutes. OK,
that's good. Then we can go on

dd784176-9667-4bf3-9cc6-1c8c109b3215-1
00:52:23.236 --> 00:52:25.180
to the next one. It's.

a6c2fe22-3247-45a3-aa23-70d8444ac785-0
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:28.710
A graphic novel.

75b4d63a-23c0-4c08-99b0-d7cdd5eedfcd-0
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.365
So please describe what you see
and what is happening as you

75b4d63a-23c0-4c08-99b0-d7cdd5eedfcd-1
00:52:35.365 --> 00:52:36.360
tell the story.

dfe95a75-0130-4767-99b7-0759428fc379-0
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:43.786
#START_arrival_6 Alright, so
it's a pot and there's a bird

dfe95a75-0130-4767-99b7-0759428fc379-1
00:52:43.786 --> 00:52:50.788
that goes over to the pot and
Umm kind of looks it sits on the

dfe95a75-0130-4767-99b7-0759428fc379-2
00:52:50.788 --> 00:52:53.900
edge and then jumps into it.

8a47b0c6-8bc8-4d7b-affa-d7b53aa5cf8e-0
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.660
Um and.

cfbad6d1-2e58-4647-9981-22655d7bcf00-0
00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.802
As it's against the mirror and
we see a man writing a letter

cfbad6d1-2e58-4647-9981-22655d7bcf00-1
00:53:02.802 --> 00:53:07.021
and then folding it up and
turning it into a swan, placing

cfbad6d1-2e58-4647-9981-22655d7bcf00-2
00:53:07.021 --> 00:53:11.025
the swan and several bills of
cash into an envelope and

cfbad6d1-2e58-4647-9981-22655d7bcf00-3
00:53:11.025 --> 00:53:15.459
mailing it, getting ready to
mail it, he brings it down. This

cfbad6d1-2e58-4647-9981-22655d7bcf00-4
00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:18.320
is the same man that has the
shark pet.

6f2eea9f-1b46-4784-8d3f-823e4ce5b576-0
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:26.182
And he asked a woman, where do I
mail this off to? And he presses

6f2eea9f-1b46-4784-8d3f-823e4ce5b576-1
00:53:26.182 --> 00:53:30.490
a button, turns the key and Umm,
mails off his.

e4da5461-70cb-46f1-a962-927540b006c4-0
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:36.505
Letter and instead of it just
sitting like a regular post like

e4da5461-70cb-46f1-a962-927540b006c4-1
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.500
post mail, drop-off. It.

3a7e4f85-cad6-4826-9a99-90e3fa7a8ef5-0
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:43.140
Releases a balloon and flows up
into the sky.

e8814dde-b0a6-48d6-8e81-eccb58f078a9-0
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.930
Umm, there are several leaves
that are all around.

7b4d5556-362e-4c3e-88a4-94e6469c8a02-0
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.530
There is one lease that is.

f8321f7f-49d9-4f07-b3a9-828e8cabcaa6-0
00:53:54.250 --> 00:54:00.501
Breaking into two so it follows
the path of each leaf throughout

f8321f7f-49d9-4f07-b3a9-828e8cabcaa6-1
00:54:00.501 --> 00:54:01.560
the season.

3189b818-5707-4ded-969b-529557f8eee4-0
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:05.410
So this particular leave

1f221d4c-b55b-4666-97d5-e614e7f41fbd-0
00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:11.114
Splits in the rain and then
opens up into two wings with a

1f221d4c-b55b-4666-97d5-e614e7f41fbd-1
00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:16.564
bulb in the middle and the bulb
ends up. It's actually all one

1f221d4c-b55b-4666-97d5-e614e7f41fbd-2
00:54:16.564 --> 00:54:22.101
flower, so the bulb, the leaves
of the flower tend to melt away

1f221d4c-b55b-4666-97d5-e614e7f41fbd-3
00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:27.378
and the bulb just keeps getting
bigger and growing. Umm, the

1f221d4c-b55b-4666-97d5-e614e7f41fbd-4
00:54:27.378 --> 00:54:32.050
fibers of the flower start to
stretch as well as the.

9bb416a3-6a1d-4778-b296-9834fe22cf62-0
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.673
Circle gets bigger and bigger
and bigger and it starts to

9bb416a3-6a1d-4778-b296-9834fe22cf62-1
00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.290
become brighter and brighter.

aae626ae-de83-4bdb-8cdc-56b0feebf439-0
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:44.671
The fibers become so fine, quite
similar to a dandelion, and the

aae626ae-de83-4bdb-8cdc-56b0feebf439-1
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:48.793
dandelion fibers break off and
they start to fly away,

aae626ae-de83-4bdb-8cdc-56b0feebf439-2
00:54:48.793 --> 00:54:53.365
revealing a scalloped flower.
Almost like if you drew like a

aae626ae-de83-4bdb-8cdc-56b0feebf439-3
00:54:53.365 --> 00:54:58.012
little flower as a kid with lots
of different petals that are

aae626ae-de83-4bdb-8cdc-56b0feebf439-4
00:54:58.012 --> 00:55:01.010
separated with a a fiber in the
middle.

8b09fa79-d14e-4427-9527-3a0834b1d3ab-0
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.870
One of those fibers. They shrink
into about 6 different buds.

a18177df-678b-40bd-89fc-1be2fd00d9d6-0
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:17.538
It's almost like bean size and
the beans fall off and little

a18177df-678b-40bd-89fc-1be2fd00d9d6-1
00:55:17.538 --> 00:55:24.227
animals go around and pick up
the beans and then it's just a

a18177df-678b-40bd-89fc-1be2fd00d9d6-2
00:55:24.227 --> 00:55:29.600
green blank flower and then as
the winter comes.

a2b2abf1-5016-4cc5-934e-4f2db6c04962-0
00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:33.610
Parts of the flowers start to
break away.

f82aa400-8fc8-46f1-b228-1f7d47d41c3a-0
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:40.556
And it becomes more and more
fibrous and very fragile, with a

f82aa400-8fc8-46f1-b228-1f7d47d41c3a-1
00:55:40.556 --> 00:55:43.920
delicate tracing of the flower
and it.

30276daa-7d0a-4714-8711-a8d54c394884-0
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:50.922
Fibers until it's lined and we
can see where the pedals and the

30276daa-7d0a-4714-8711-a8d54c394884-1
00:55:50.922 --> 00:55:51.990
beans were.

893c1827-0960-472d-8595-7ed470564edd-0
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:56.815
But there's no inner casing.
It's just the inner fibers of

893c1827-0960-472d-8595-7ed470564edd-1
00:55:56.815 --> 00:56:00.530
this flower. And it's in snow.
It's encased in the snow.

eb795b65-6cff-4616-b89c-e4572b0f4ccd-0
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:10.450
So now it's snowing and it's
winter time in this little.

2706d768-f4dc-49ef-b3bf-9c0f703030aa-0
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:16.513
Yeah, it's winter time in this
village and we can tell from the

2706d768-f4dc-49ef-b3bf-9c0f703030aa-1
00:56:16.513 --> 00:56:20.838
snow that's kind of going around
as well as all of the flowers

2706d768-f4dc-49ef-b3bf-9c0f703030aa-2
00:56:20.838 --> 00:56:25.164
that we just kind of saw that
you see a little bit on the left

2706d768-f4dc-49ef-b3bf-9c0f703030aa-3
00:56:25.164 --> 00:56:29.557
side of the page or on the right
side of the page that are just

2706d768-f4dc-49ef-b3bf-9c0f703030aa-4
00:56:29.557 --> 00:56:32.509
very small and and fibrous and
very snowy.

458094c2-771e-4580-b929-e9fa5ab1800c-0
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:39.060
Um.

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-0
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:44.071
So we get we see the pot again
that's beginning to fill up with

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-1
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:48.267
more and more birds as they get
cold. The man is looking at a

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-2
00:56:48.267 --> 00:56:52.463
picture in his bedroom window.
This shark pet looks very sad,

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-3
00:56:52.463 --> 00:56:56.456
but he's just resting and he
automatically hears something

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-4
00:56:56.456 --> 00:57:00.719
and darts towards downstairs.
The man looks up from his framed

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-5
00:57:00.719 --> 00:57:04.712
picture and goes down to his
fellow, and he sees that they

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-6
00:57:04.712 --> 00:57:08.840
got mail. And the man looks so
relieved he opens up the mail

6ebaff0b-8fe4-40be-8d7d-62628bfc115d-7
00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.449
and sees.

423957fa-f00b-4349-9692-02b80365f6ef-0
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:14.139
A paper bird. He opens it up and
it's a letter, and he looks

423957fa-f00b-4349-9692-02b80365f6ef-1
00:57:14.139 --> 00:57:17.480
outside to see who could have
dropped it off.

e19583f2-b8c4-48fb-b833-baa84cac817a-0
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:22.100
Um.

a6a18bb1-18ab-44b1-9ac9-c1974933f111-0
00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:29.431
And then we see a series of
different objects. We see the

a6a18bb1-18ab-44b1-9ac9-c1974933f111-1
00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:33.970
shark pet that is in an origami
paper shark pet.

7f43f801-398c-4c18-9242-b0b7912288e7-0
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:40.204
A cabinet of some sort. It's
like a metallic cabinet, but we

7f43f801-398c-4c18-9242-b0b7912288e7-1
00:57:40.204 --> 00:57:45.172
see that those are dishes inside
his hat and his wife headscarf

7f43f801-398c-4c18-9242-b0b7912288e7-2
00:57:45.172 --> 00:57:49.829
from the last story. We see the
squash that he's got on his

7f43f801-398c-4c18-9242-b0b7912288e7-3
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:53.090
grocery trip, the child's
drawing of the.

e015f0cb-a524-4cc7-a79e-7b9165a2b582-0
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:56.180
Boats in the sky.

0eb196a6-04fb-43fa-b5b8-e05f9af58b33-0
00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:00.640
I'm assuming a tea kettle.

bbedaa60-d1df-4187-9643-360ff0e53d83-0
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:07.006
Uh, because of the smoke that's
coming from it? No, it's coffee.

bbedaa60-d1df-4187-9643-360ff0e53d83-1
00:58:07.006 --> 00:58:11.744
It's coffee pot, because then it
shows us coffee that is also

bbedaa60-d1df-4187-9643-360ff0e53d83-2
00:58:11.744 --> 00:58:12.050
hot.

893b985d-d277-4251-addb-42734985386e-0
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:17.970
And a coffee mug. The picture.
The framed picture of the

893b985d-d277-4251-addb-42734985386e-1
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:22.600
husband, his wife and his child.
And someone handing him a coin.

a6995fd9-d420-4763-84f6-57abc6899846-0
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.970
And.

056e0179-8ffd-4b76-96b7-3f049b0cfd7f-0
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.250
Then it's flashes to their home.

23258f06-a8d7-4fbc-9474-6a672b1e7445-0
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.303
And we see all of those
different pieces altogether.

23258f06-a8d7-4fbc-9474-6a672b1e7445-1
00:58:35.303 --> 00:58:39.191
They're having a nice meal
together, the father is holding

23258f06-a8d7-4fbc-9474-6a672b1e7445-2
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:43.475
up three fingers, and they must
be playing some type of guessing

23258f06-a8d7-4fbc-9474-6a672b1e7445-3
00:58:43.475 --> 00:58:47.166
game or counting. Maybe it's a
birthday. Maybe it's her

23258f06-a8d7-4fbc-9474-6a672b1e7445-4
00:58:47.166 --> 00:58:47.760
birthday.

4f472fb4-4569-47ed-8ac9-c02329c83143-0
00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:53.723
And the shark, little creature,
their pet is at the foot of the

4f472fb4-4569-47ed-8ac9-c02329c83143-1
00:58:53.723 --> 00:58:57.960
child. And then she goes to put
on her snow boots, go outside

4f472fb4-4569-47ed-8ac9-c02329c83143-2
00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.129
and play in the snow pet hands
her her hat and she's so gets

4f472fb4-4569-47ed-8ac9-c02329c83143-3
00:59:02.129 --> 00:59:06.434
her hat all situated. And she
and her pet run outside and they

4f472fb4-4569-47ed-8ac9-c02329c83143-4
00:59:06.434 --> 00:59:10.671
see light beaming on the ground
of the city and they start to

4f472fb4-4569-47ed-8ac9-c02329c83143-5
00:59:10.671 --> 00:59:13.200
rise up into the air.
#END_arrival_6

dd10f98a-da5b-4e4d-b93f-d5bc3007fcd6-0
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:20.490
OK, that was good. There was
this story, the next one.

2b9b13c4-cbe6-4708-b7dc-b1a7b9b9e585-0
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.180
Another part of it.

1c01fa17-9239-4a62-8540-a98095a18f93-0
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:28.641
#START_arrival_3 Alright, so
there's a boy that's standing on

1c01fa17-9239-4a62-8540-a98095a18f93-1
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:30.820
the side of the road with a
sign.

205ac968-c9a6-407c-b4c3-105957a03cd3-0
00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:38.423
A woman is holding a cat
creature. These all seemed to be

205ac968-c9a6-407c-b4c3-105957a03cd3-1
00:59:38.423 --> 00:59:42.646
a little depictions of what's
going on in the city cat

205ac968-c9a6-407c-b4c3-105957a03cd3-2
00:59:42.646 --> 00:59:47.100
creature. A man is getting
shaved. There is a band that's

205ac968-c9a6-407c-b4c3-105957a03cd3-3
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.790
playing in the street.

f0ed83b0-41ba-46a4-b6aa-33f3566b20b5-0
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:56.897
Umm, so that some type of horn
they've got some type of violin

f0ed83b0-41ba-46a4-b6aa-33f3566b20b5-1
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:57.130
uh

cc86a19f-a53b-49dd-8d93-25ae1bd058c2-0
00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.670
Carts for coffee, giant eggs.

6af8e526-f5df-40d6-9046-d08571c0ebb1-0
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:06.479
Women sitting in some type of, I
think, reading at the train

6af8e526-f5df-40d6-9046-d08571c0ebb1-1
01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:10.506
station, reading a magazine and
then we get back to the man with

6af8e526-f5df-40d6-9046-d08571c0ebb1-2
01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:11.250
his luggage.

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-0
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:18.990
And he's looking at the time. He
has his pocket watch, he's

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-1
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:23.526
looking nervously at the time,
and then he's looking nervously

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-2
01:00:23.526 --> 01:00:27.846
up at the bigger clock. He's
realizing he might be late. So

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-3
01:00:27.846 --> 01:00:32.023
he takes his suitcase. He starts
walking, and he sees the

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-4
01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:36.055
speckles in the sky that are
floating up, and he's very

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-5
01:00:36.055 --> 01:00:40.375
confused. And all of a sudden
his hat is blown off his head

d624db97-e8e6-4f9d-96b9-01336ddd1a32-6
01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:43.040
and falls to the ground and he
goes.

5cbd84a6-eda9-404a-8a2c-e66d8080560f-0
01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.466
Pick up the hat and sees a map
on the ground and he picks up

5cbd84a6-eda9-404a-8a2c-e66d8080560f-1
01:00:47.466 --> 01:00:51.385
his book and starts to see
what's going on and try and

5cbd84a6-eda9-404a-8a2c-e66d8080560f-2
01:00:51.385 --> 01:00:55.161
understand and someone
approaches him and ask him if

5cbd84a6-eda9-404a-8a2c-e66d8080560f-3
01:00:55.161 --> 01:00:59.650
he's OK and he starts to depict
what's going on and he asks do

5cbd84a6-eda9-404a-8a2c-e66d8080560f-4
01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:00.790
you have a room?

1a7165c1-780d-4728-b7ff-b03712a8799f-0
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.150
Umm.

e9e1bea1-eb5b-4dbd-802a-7b8937d21a3a-0
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:07.224
And the man says, yes, I do have
a room, follow me. And so the

e9e1bea1-eb5b-4dbd-802a-7b8937d21a3a-1
01:01:07.224 --> 01:01:10.956
man takes his suitcase and
follows the other man and his

e9e1bea1-eb5b-4dbd-802a-7b8937d21a3a-2
01:01:10.956 --> 01:01:12.200
pet. #END_arrival_3

3c627f76-1589-42c9-bb8e-b99325e36bc6-0
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.225
OK, so moving on, the next item
is a complex scene and describe

3c627f76-1589-42c9-bb8e-b99325e36bc6-1
01:01:20.225 --> 01:01:26.451
what is what you see and what is
happening in as much detail as

3c627f76-1589-42c9-bb8e-b99325e36bc6-2
01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:27.230
you can.

1b8f5326-15a4-4b69-aec8-9738c0a20f89-0
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.290
#START_ancient_rome So this is
an ancient Rome depiction scene.

1b8f5326-15a4-4b69-aec8-9738c0a20f89-1
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:40.136
It looks like a gladiator ring.
So the ring is all around. There

1b8f5326-15a4-4b69-aec8-9738c0a20f89-2
01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:42.820
are gladiators fighting
throughout.

1e988d2c-1014-4d74-8f0c-729d5b8abff6-0
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:48.206
In the corner lions they're
piling on top of one another to

1e988d2c-1014-4d74-8f0c-729d5b8abff6-1
01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:52.731
escape from the gladiator ring,
so they've built almost like a a

1e988d2c-1014-4d74-8f0c-729d5b8abff6-2
01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:54.750
lion pyramid to crawl out of.

aacc2ccd-1ace-401d-a16f-068cc7409766-0
01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.610
And they're attacking the people
that are in the.

b794823b-5c12-4eb4-942e-9161bca10b67-0
01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.090
Street that are in the.

cf279142-4ce1-4180-85a0-a1dc3978450a-0
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.630
Seats and then there's also.

c08d7391-06a8-42f8-a029-1c8557dceb87-0
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.220
Of a horse that is.

b4a20cee-b352-4021-bfb4-ade478662c48-0
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.965
Rather than the comparison of a
chariot with a person being

b4a20cee-b352-4021-bfb4-ade478662c48-1
01:02:18.965 --> 01:02:22.216
towed by horses, there is a
horse being towed by human

b4a20cee-b352-4021-bfb4-ade478662c48-2
01:02:22.216 --> 01:02:22.629
beings.

f3dee903-c54d-4413-9928-b4c7e9afe88a-0
01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.265
And they're running throughout
and that's also with the kind of

f3dee903-c54d-4413-9928-b4c7e9afe88a-1
01:02:28.265 --> 01:02:32.359
in progression with a lot of
other Chariots. There's bunch of

f3dee903-c54d-4413-9928-b4c7e9afe88a-2
01:02:32.359 --> 01:02:36.585
horses running wild with people
holding on for dear life behind

f3dee903-c54d-4413-9928-b4c7e9afe88a-3
01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:37.179
them and.

11f16140-bbaf-4c6c-8657-79954816727c-0
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:43.951
They are being flattened. Oh, my
gosh. They're flattening people

11f16140-bbaf-4c6c-8657-79954816727c-1
01:02:43.951 --> 01:02:45.210
all throughout.

f51c2c91-2276-44df-8226-0e041193fc77-0
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.600
There's a lion that has a bib
and has a man in a blue bowl and

f51c2c91-2276-44df-8226-0e041193fc77-1
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.281
is getting them ready for. So
you got a fork and a knife, like

f51c2c91-2276-44df-8226-0e041193fc77-2
01:02:56.281 --> 01:02:58.510
he's getting ready to eat him.

5847d1ce-b220-41dc-b40d-52dd91b6f50d-0
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:06.880
And next to the Blue Bowl,
another person is preparing a.

e7109c4e-ddac-4cf8-adb7-c32ca873abd1-0
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.250
Bowl of milk in a red bowl.

44c778ef-6b4e-4c80-843e-f2e460011f70-0
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.680
There are several cheetahs that
are kind of around.

8488c1cd-960e-43d2-ae49-f8bf72aa6203-0
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.186
But not not as relevant, but
they're next to the horses and

8488c1cd-960e-43d2-ae49-f8bf72aa6203-1
01:03:22.186 --> 01:03:23.020
everything.

3dc9e176-066d-4716-9f22-0800fb3e216b-0
01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.090
And we see.

77ab6d84-8598-4c1a-81d6-2089fd351f6c-0
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.722
Several different yeah, we see
the cheetahs running around. The

77ab6d84-8598-4c1a-81d6-2089fd351f6c-1
01:03:30.722 --> 01:03:33.850
Lions have kind of all escaped.
Chaos has ensued.

358a8347-7581-4707-b360-d87102781aa2-0
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:42.378
There are lions coming out of
this hole as warriors have

358a8347-7581-4707-b360-d87102781aa2-1
01:03:42.378 --> 01:03:48.246
pressed themselves up against
the wall so as not to be seen by

358a8347-7581-4707-b360-d87102781aa2-2
01:03:48.246 --> 01:03:49.550
the the Lions.

24a6800e-46ad-4c68-bde1-4c3995fe7efa-0
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.800
Umm, in again at at the back of
the gladiator ring there is a

24a6800e-46ad-4c68-bde1-4c3995fe7efa-1
01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.582
picture of a man next to a
picture of a lion and someone

24a6800e-46ad-4c68-bde1-4c3995fe7efa-2
01:04:00.582 --> 01:04:06.034
seems to be taking score of how
many times the lion has won over

24a6800e-46ad-4c68-bde1-4c3995fe7efa-3
01:04:06.034 --> 01:04:10.983
the man, and the man has no
scores tallied under him. It's

24a6800e-46ad-4c68-bde1-4c3995fe7efa-4
01:04:10.983 --> 01:04:12.410
all for the lion.

7616a861-84b7-4592-9e08-c52f22e231ed-0
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.525
We also see above that gated
hole there are about. There are

7616a861-84b7-4592-9e08-c52f22e231ed-1
01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:24.532
a bunch of guards that are all
standing at attention and some

7616a861-84b7-4592-9e08-c52f22e231ed-2
01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:29.216
type of ruler seems to be
watching all of this chaos from

7616a861-84b7-4592-9e08-c52f22e231ed-3
01:04:29.216 --> 01:04:34.222
a pink bed and just laying in
bed and watching it all unfold.

7616a861-84b7-4592-9e08-c52f22e231ed-4
01:04:34.222 --> 01:04:39.067
The guards don't seem to be
concerned at all, they are just

7616a861-84b7-4592-9e08-c52f22e231ed-5
01:04:39.067 --> 01:04:43.589
standing at attention and
watching all of this go down.

22303ae0-9011-4afa-afc8-326d63171db1-0
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:51.255
Several of there to the left of
the guards there are people that

22303ae0-9011-4afa-afc8-326d63171db1-1
01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:57.155
have escaped the lion down in
the ring, only for a lion to be

22303ae0-9011-4afa-afc8-326d63171db1-2
01:04:57.155 --> 01:04:59.820
waiting for them at the top.

069d920e-0273-4510-b35b-d411463dbc8c-0
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.940
And.

87688c39-2fb1-4b77-8dff-d75dbd0a9149-0
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.142
To the right we all of the
guards. We also see that these

87688c39-2fb1-4b77-8dff-d75dbd0a9149-1
01:05:06.142 --> 01:05:09.720
people have kind of built human
ladder and are trying to escape

87688c39-2fb1-4b77-8dff-d75dbd0a9149-2
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.230
the ring. #END_ancient_rome

7f6c73ba-dc30-4598-84d6-2c6a5a92acd0-0
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.240
OK.

b4e40579-d744-4f1b-a8ae-709aef8916e4-0
01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.230
Right. That was about time. We
can go on to the next one.

9b6729c0-66b3-4a88-8803-c33faf980d79-0
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:30.106
#START_arrival_5 Alright, so
this is in a city there looks,

9b6729c0-66b3-4a88-8803-c33faf980d79-1
01:05:30.106 --> 01:05:35.128
or a village of some sort
they're used to. It looks like

9b6729c0-66b3-4a88-8803-c33faf980d79-2
01:05:35.128 --> 01:05:36.450
there are owls.

301650b9-2292-4c94-ae4b-b023022b8e79-0
01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:41.936
Statues that have birds coming
out of them. Maybe they're

301650b9-2292-4c94-ae4b-b023022b8e79-1
01:05:41.936 --> 01:05:42.580
aviaries.

b9a89ed5-c727-42e0-ae93-ab05f0da1611-0
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:49.893
But this is the scene that of
the village is these five or six

b9a89ed5-c727-42e0-ae93-ab05f0da1611-1
01:05:49.893 --> 01:05:55.585
giant bird statues that have
birds coming out of them. And so

b9a89ed5-c727-42e0-ae93-ab05f0da1611-2
01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:57.880
then we see a cat statue.

b9714f1b-2be7-4b2b-ba72-2610a82f0113-0
01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.050
and someone starts to wrap it
up.

c2afcebe-0b2e-4048-9eb0-17835f3a2c2a-0
01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.290
The man we saw earlier is
showing.

bc9ddc3c-40e3-4de8-a0f1-a6ae0e08fa9f-0
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:10.695
The the father we saw earlier
was showing the man something as

bc9ddc3c-40e3-4de8-a0f1-a6ae0e08fa9f-1
01:06:10.695 --> 01:06:15.310
the little boy, his dragon cat
and the little pet go upstairs.

b6147301-610c-4027-95b4-bc073d9e8e32-0
01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:20.992
Oh they're meeting with they're
meeting family meeting his

b6147301-610c-4027-95b4-bc073d9e8e32-1
01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:23.380
family so little boy is
bringing.

2647d54c-cf94-481c-bacb-4415a05181e1-0
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:30.241
The bowl of groceries that they
had up to the wife, the father

2647d54c-cf94-481c-bacb-4415a05181e1-1
01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:34.600
of the little boy greets his the
man's wife, or he.

6a27dfeb-714e-4954-a38a-fffdb2928b4d-0
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:40.802
Kisses his own wife, and the man
shakes her hand, and she invites

6a27dfeb-714e-4954-a38a-fffdb2928b4d-1
01:06:40.802 --> 01:06:44.050
him inside. They have wine and
juice and.

04488d1b-8bb2-41b2-bc75-0278efbe16e1-0
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.872
Kind of. She starts to prepare
the meal that they all picked up

04488d1b-8bb2-41b2-bc75-0278efbe16e1-1
01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:54.593
at the grocery store that day.
So she starts chopping up the

04488d1b-8bb2-41b2-bc75-0278efbe16e1-2
01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:58.926
squash from earlier and
preparing a meal. She starts to

04488d1b-8bb2-41b2-bc75-0278efbe16e1-3
01:06:58.926 --> 01:07:00.010
make some tea.

604da0c8-49d1-4afc-81c3-f76a4fbba5d5-0
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.910
And she starts to roast a A
Turkey.

ffcf10ee-9616-4f40-b0d8-f094bf9f5763-0
01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:15.165
So they're all sitting down,
eating dinner, participating in

ffcf10ee-9616-4f40-b0d8-f094bf9f5763-1
01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:20.370
a lively conversation. He's
laughing. She's laughing as they

ffcf10ee-9616-4f40-b0d8-f094bf9f5763-2
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:25.319
eat. At some point they break
out the musical instrument.

a196cad7-6f4a-4497-a0d1-cdb784d921f8-0
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:32.011
The man starts to pay play the
accordion, she starts to play a

a196cad7-6f4a-4497-a0d1-cdb784d921f8-1
01:07:32.011 --> 01:07:37.759
flute. The boy and his dragon
start to play the banjo and and

a196cad7-6f4a-4497-a0d1-cdb784d921f8-2
01:07:37.759 --> 01:07:43.415
sing, and the man shows the
little boy how to make a origami

a196cad7-6f4a-4497-a0d1-cdb784d921f8-3
01:07:43.415 --> 01:07:49.256
dragon cat and he shows him how
to fold it. And the little boy

a196cad7-6f4a-4497-a0d1-cdb784d921f8-4
01:07:49.256 --> 01:07:54.727
has the hat on, has the man's
hat on, and he's holding the

a196cad7-6f4a-4497-a0d1-cdb784d921f8-5
01:07:54.727 --> 01:07:55.839
origami cat.

dbe19ee5-97b1-4178-b528-c8934e8822a8-0
01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.446
The man pulls out a vase and
offers it as a sign of

dbe19ee5-97b1-4178-b528-c8934e8822a8-1
01:08:01.446 --> 01:08:02.740
friendship for

363c300a-cd7e-474c-8e1e-b24b6a64263f-0
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:06.810
Becoming such good friends with
the man and his wife.

55890a05-ce01-4278-a1d9-ce31f34ba0c1-0
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:14.270
So the next day the man wakes up
and he sees the vase.

997453ab-53cd-4f61-b789-ad1ff7f18f0c-0
01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.682
On the windowsill that he put it
there, he wakes up in the

997453ab-53cd-4f61-b789-ad1ff7f18f0c-1
01:08:18.682 --> 01:08:19.570
morning light.

dd5f36a2-f9aa-4c0e-baa6-4de2215a8096-0

Starts getting ready for his pet
Jumped onto his bed and.

4ac9250e-4049-473b-8ede-3de57407e021-0
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:30.771
He pets him, and then he starts
to get ready for the day. He

4ac9250e-4049-473b-8ede-3de57407e021-1
01:08:30.771 --> 01:08:34.524
puts on his clothes, he cuts up
a fruit, gives some of it to his

4ac9250e-4049-473b-8ede-3de57407e021-2

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.760
And he heads out into the town.

3a08cf73-2402-48c3-91f0-52afc5d42d10-0
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:49.796
In the town there are people
just going about their jobs.

3a08cf73-2402-48c3-91f0-52afc5d42d10-1
01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:51.540
They're scrubbing things.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:57.700
And feeding animals like they
look like fish.

0742ce1c-56f0-4c46-b478-1d74aa462b2c-0
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.380
People are shopping, they're

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.800
Selling things off of cart.

739b07ea-d768-4bcf-9300-9763fa42475b-0
01:09:07.530 --> 01:09:10.791
It looks like he's painting. He
has a paintbrush. Yeah, they're

739b07ea-d768-4bcf-9300-9763fa42475b-1
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:12.270
fixing things, fixing clocks.

a0539d61-e10c-46ed-b70d-93bd9dcbff80-0
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:18.713
The man goes to several stores
and asks if they need help with

a0539d61-e10c-46ed-b70d-93bd9dcbff80-1
01:09:18.713 --> 01:09:23.137
work. So he goes to somebody
that's a chef and he says, do

a0539d61-e10c-46ed-b70d-93bd9dcbff80-2
01:09:23.137 --> 01:09:27.411
you need help? And they're all
holding up their hands in

a0539d61-e10c-46ed-b70d-93bd9dcbff80-3
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:31.009
protest, no, they do not need
help. He goes to.

c5b740c4-49bc-42a9-934d-021ce86a52cc-0
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:37.001
Someone working on a rig of some
sort? No, she does not need

c5b740c4-49bc-42a9-934d-021ce86a52cc-1
01:09:37.001 --> 01:09:37.380
help.

5da947fa-c645-4747-acb2-ea18b276163f-0
01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.470
Woman that sells types of
pottery. No she does not need

5da947fa-c645-4747-acb2-ea18b276163f-1
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.370
help and then he goes to the
boat yard and and they don't

5da947fa-c645-4747-acb2-ea18b276163f-2
01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:45.970
need help either. #END_arrival_5

f6fcd9ed-db78-4cb0-8082-8e5cc1c9ce9b-0
01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:55.655
OK. So that was that part of the
story and moving on to the next

f6fcd9ed-db78-4cb0-8082-8e5cc1c9ce9b-1
01:09:55.655 --> 01:09:58.300
item, it's another story.

92afc9aa-152c-413f-9c63-0740e4e1dd80-0
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:06.872
#START_return OK, alright, so
here we have the girl from

92afc9aa-152c-413f-9c63-0740e4e1dd80-1
01:10:06.872 --> 01:10:12.275
earlier. She we see the dad is
still working upstairs on

92afc9aa-152c-413f-9c63-0740e4e1dd80-2
01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.740
something. We see the red.

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-0
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:22.092
Kite from earlier or not from
earlier, but from like earlier

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-1
01:10:22.092 --> 01:10:26.657
in the book and she's also
drawn. She has her red, her

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-2
01:10:26.657 --> 01:10:32.052
orange crown on. We also see the
red, a red hot air balloon that

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-3
01:10:32.052 --> 01:10:37.114
she got away with in the first
book. The dragon fly that was

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-4
01:10:37.114 --> 01:10:42.094
pink, that is. You also must
have drawn a little picture of

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-5
01:10:42.094 --> 01:10:46.825
and now she's drawing on the
wall, she's drawing another

0459fb42-d0c7-47b4-b0c2-58a7b4beb70c-6
01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:47.239
door.

29a4ad6a-efd4-4e6b-995c-3a166425b00a-0
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.854
And she's got a ball and it
looks like she's going to go

29a4ad6a-efd4-4e6b-995c-3a166425b00a-1
01:10:49.854 --> 01:10:50.210
through.

9a44f530-2c97-432f-8dec-9a30e84f418b-0
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.290
The hole.

f0211ba0-bbbf-40ee-8368-b8ac6c44e731-0
01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:59.530
So the dad finally looks up and
he looks down. He sees the kite

f0211ba0-bbbf-40ee-8368-b8ac6c44e731-1
01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:03.130
and he gets a little concerned
about his daughter and so he

f0211ba0-bbbf-40ee-8368-b8ac6c44e731-2
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:06.910
goes to go find her and instead
he finds the red door that she

f0211ba0-bbbf-40ee-8368-b8ac6c44e731-3
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:10.870
drew. So he's looking through it
and he's looking like he's going

f0211ba0-bbbf-40ee-8368-b8ac6c44e731-4
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:12.190
to follow her through.

7e98c19f-01fb-4a5a-a0d0-1cf7899823e5-0
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:20.321
So he goes through and he goes
into that, the wood, the wooded

7e98c19f-01fb-4a5a-a0d0-1cf7899823e5-1
01:11:20.321 --> 01:11:26.336
Lantern village that was there
last time, and he sees all the

7e98c19f-01fb-4a5a-a0d0-1cf7899823e5-2
01:11:26.336 --> 01:11:32.254
trees, all the lights that have
illuminated the sky. He sees

7e98c19f-01fb-4a5a-a0d0-1cf7899823e5-3
01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:38.560
that the the ball on the bridge,
and he walks towards the river.

2c3c6ea6-0f36-4b20-b24b-8ad0f050fb12-0
01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:48.003
Picks up the ball, and as he
does, a boat comes by, and looks

2c3c6ea6-0f36-4b20-b24b-8ad0f050fb12-1
01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:50.420
in the shape of a dragon.

805e4ec6-d18d-44dc-960e-878d797c886d-0
01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:56.544
Some sort, and as the boat
passes by the dock, the man gets

805e4ec6-d18d-44dc-960e-878d797c886d-1
01:11:56.544 --> 01:11:59.000
on board the boat with the ball.

679ad61c-7e1f-44cc-86cc-06892e4b4bb8-0
01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.746
And so now they're coming into
the the city we see he's still

679ad61c-7e1f-44cc-86cc-06892e4b4bb8-1
01:12:06.746 --> 01:12:11.313
holding on to the red ball, the
dad's still holding on to the

679ad61c-7e1f-44cc-86cc-06892e4b4bb8-2
01:12:11.313 --> 01:12:16.174
red ball, and the little girl is
now floating on the aqueducts in

679ad61c-7e1f-44cc-86cc-06892e4b4bb8-3
01:12:16.174 --> 01:12:20.520
her red boat. We can see that
the moon is a full moon. And

679ad61c-7e1f-44cc-86cc-06892e4b4bb8-4
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.382
she's right below the full moon,
it just floating along in the in

679ad61c-7e1f-44cc-86cc-06892e4b4bb8-5
01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:27.150
the aqueduct in her red.

98b8b626-811a-4394-b85a-2e2fe78270b6-0
01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:33.230
Red boat and the man starts
coming into the city to to dock.

dc7881f2-fd82-4dfa-8296-d2441c24515f-0
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:37.480
So when he docks

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-0
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.673
He jumps off and she gets off
her. But at the same time, and

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-1
01:12:42.673 --> 01:12:46.707
we see the little boy and the
king and the bird as well. And

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-2
01:12:46.707 --> 01:12:50.873
the dad says, wait, wait up. And
so then they're in the palace

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-3
01:12:50.873 --> 01:12:55.172
room and he wants to go and talk
to her and she does not want to

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-4
01:12:55.172 --> 01:12:59.338
talk to him. She has her arms
crossed. She has her head turned

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-5
01:12:59.338 --> 01:13:03.239
away and her eyes closed. The
king and the little boy look

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-6
01:13:03.239 --> 01:13:07.604
very concerned for their friend.
They want her to be able to talk

d987fe67-489a-4236-994b-2dc8479c184d-7
01:13:07.604 --> 01:13:08.530
to her father.

6d5e7011-dc51-46ea-b5d3-61c886fc8cf9-0
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:11.740
She is not interested in talking
to her father.

23be0ecc-d32e-4174-9586-25d4fdeeedad-0
01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.400
Umm.

ae6d6f08-a37f-4563-b379-3b756a9a5e44-0
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.520
Off of the boat.

801d059b-1ce7-4b5f-a434-f620867331d8-0
01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.850
Like a Trojan horse, that's
another.

bd0451e1-844a-4563-bae5-e1cb97c5a25c-0
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.750
Mean evil or evil person.

35d52274-4488-41c1-9ab7-8c6bede9c681-0
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:33.009
I think it might be the same
guards as before that want to

35d52274-4488-41c1-9ab7-8c6bede9c681-1
01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:37.769
get the cray the the magic
marker is so they they step off

35d52274-4488-41c1-9ab7-8c6bede9c681-2
01:13:37.769 --> 01:13:42.610
of the boat and they start to
chase after the king, the boy

35d52274-4488-41c1-9ab7-8c6bede9c681-3
01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:44.950
and the girl and now the dad.

c1214fc5-aefd-444b-9df1-83b20094c939-0
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.780
So the king.

80a718e2-de34-492a-9959-62688ec920c6-0
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.490
Draws a sword and starts to.

922f0ecd-a2ce-451e-a053-144290b5e2fd-0
01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:56.540
Fight.

0255c2d7-132f-4609-82d1-9e9b62f28e6a-0
01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:01.380
the guard or fight the.

bd2c9812-8c64-45c3-b16c-55fe51ac17a0-0
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:07.480
knight with the hat, but he has
some sort of contraption that.

5683329a-d9ba-4ccb-86cc-46194b43d99f-0
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:13.076
Sucks in all of the markers. So
he opens it up and he sucks in

5683329a-d9ba-4ccb-86cc-46194b43d99f-1
01:14:13.076 --> 01:14:17.802
all of the markers and takes all
of the markers off of the the

5683329a-d9ba-4ccb-86cc-46194b43d99f-2
01:14:17.802 --> 01:14:22.228
band that they had and now he
has it imprisoned and so the

5683329a-d9ba-4ccb-86cc-46194b43d99f-3
01:14:22.228 --> 01:14:27.179
other guards capture the king as
the evil knight runs towards the

5683329a-d9ba-4ccb-86cc-46194b43d99f-4
01:14:27.179 --> 01:14:29.130
girl, the boy and her dad.

5e19ccb9-984e-43c7-afcf-4d95af190b3e-0
01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:37.034
The little boy draws a a Griffin
to fly away on and so they all

5e19ccb9-984e-43c7-afcf-4d95af190b3e-1
01:14:37.034 --> 01:14:42.222
get on board the Griffin and get
away just in time for the OR

5e19ccb9-984e-43c7-afcf-4d95af190b3e-2
01:14:42.222 --> 01:14:47.242
yeah, it's a Griffin of some
sort. And then as they all fly

5e19ccb9-984e-43c7-afcf-4d95af190b3e-3
01:14:47.242 --> 01:14:52.429
away as the man reaches out to
go, as the evil knight reaches

5e19ccb9-984e-43c7-afcf-4d95af190b3e-4
01:14:52.429 --> 01:14:57.450
out to get them and they fly
away into the night to safety.

8241fc61-8f31-4f41-a6af-5844d0a8c59d-0
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:05.871
Um, but as they do, the man, the
evil knight opens, He's fl he's

8241fc61-8f31-4f41-a6af-5844d0a8c59d-1
01:15:05.871 --> 01:15:09.960
flying on the boat that now has
turned into a flying.

abecbcb7-2ea4-4873-8050-331cbff29607-0
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:16.331
Contraption with wings and he
has his device that sucks in the

abecbcb7-2ea4-4873-8050-331cbff29607-1
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:21.265
markers and he sucks in the pink
marker and the little boy loses

abecbcb7-2ea4-4873-8050-331cbff29607-2
01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:22.480
his pink marker.

b2b19d23-45c7-4c90-9538-d5dfffc9117b-0
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.930
And then the Griffin.

3a1976a6-67d3-4659-a4a1-41e000a0a469-0
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.915
Gets sucked in as well because
of the drone. It's it's drawn by

3a1976a6-67d3-4659-a4a1-41e000a0a469-1
01:15:34.915 --> 01:15:39.193
the pink marker it's all get
sucked in there, and as they all

3a1976a6-67d3-4659-a4a1-41e000a0a469-2
01:15:39.193 --> 01:15:43.609
fall, the little boy is caught
by the king, but the dad and the

3a1976a6-67d3-4659-a4a1-41e000a0a469-3
01:15:43.609 --> 01:15:45.610
little girl are falling down.

373bf593-b129-4cd4-abe8-fa37828f5290-0
01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:53.732
Umm. And they fall into the
water. The little girl begins to

373bf593-b129-4cd4-abe8-fa37828f5290-1
01:15:53.732 --> 01:15:55.230
draw a submarine.

86672f7b-8a70-4808-be8e-49a56531c8f0-0
01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.211
Um. So she draws the submarine
and they start to they're they

86672f7b-8a70-4808-be8e-49a56531c8f0-1
01:16:03.211 --> 01:16:08.140
stay underwater under safety. As
she keeps on the lookout, the

86672f7b-8a70-4808-be8e-49a56531c8f0-2
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.410
dad goes down below the deck.

0bbabfd8-7c40-42a1-896f-b6abbc1a788d-0
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:19.632
They go into a cave to hide out
and then they dock the the

0bbabfd8-7c40-42a1-896f-b6abbc1a788d-1
01:16:19.632 --> 01:16:25.449
submarine. They see all of these
contraptions, all all of these

0bbabfd8-7c40-42a1-896f-b6abbc1a788d-2
01:16:25.449 --> 01:16:30.629
these drawings all over the
walls of. We see the hot air

0bbabfd8-7c40-42a1-896f-b6abbc1a788d-3
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.720
balloon, we see people.

28f9d9c6-796e-46cf-86a3-cb83b0b7a72f-0
01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:38.384
That are participating in a
multitude of activities. There

28f9d9c6-796e-46cf-86a3-cb83b0b7a72f-1
01:16:38.384 --> 01:16:41.870
are doors. I think we see
drawings of the king.

92e287ae-feb4-4f8f-b2c0-fad9d344b705-0
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:47.560
And her activities we're seeing.

74500339-d85c-4294-a252-f195eef10896-0
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:53.157
It looks like the drawing of the
book because it looks like

74500339-d85c-4294-a252-f195eef10896-1
01:16:53.157 --> 01:16:54.240
there's a Griffin.

290a4e80-b91f-4246-ae16-ee8cd21881e9-0
01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:58.970
And one of The Cave drawings as
well. So we're seeing kind of

290a4e80-b91f-4246-ae16-ee8cd21881e9-1
01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:02.853
the book series get drawn out of
what the power of the markers

290a4e80-b91f-4246-ae16-ee8cd21881e9-2
01:17:02.853 --> 01:17:03.099
are.

127ec464-74ae-4d4d-95fb-a080afe683ee-0
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:10.180
So she points towards the.

081e1ba4-5df7-4e9a-a3a6-4fe1e27de4db-0
01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.880
One where she sees that.

6a67f656-174c-42c5-b665-552546af1b08-0
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:15.110
Umm.

3dc53add-5006-471f-930d-62d7084c3415-0
01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:22.947
This particular drawing depicts
somebody has a marker and the

3dc53add-5006-471f-930d-62d7084c3415-1
01:17:22.947 --> 01:17:29.821
man with the horn. He plans to
suck up all of that power and

3dc53add-5006-471f-930d-62d7084c3415-2
01:17:29.821 --> 01:17:33.090
then dump that off somewhere.

a3cb2a7e-2979-4b30-b025-89989532582a-0
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:35.280
Yeah.

7b06aa97-7cd3-4cf2-b040-278fae519dff-0
01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.970
So she's like, we have to go
alert.

2ce6882e-b2dc-4200-8c90-d7d9aafc42d3-0
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.820
People we have to protect the
bird because the bird is going

2ce6882e-b2dc-4200-8c90-d7d9aafc42d3-1
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:52.025
to be captured as well because
she sees that the bird is being

2ce6882e-b2dc-4200-8c90-d7d9aafc42d3-2
01:17:52.025 --> 01:17:57.148
captured so she draw as the the
boat approaches capture them,

2ce6882e-b2dc-4200-8c90-d7d9aafc42d3-3
01:17:57.148 --> 01:18:02.436
they draw a special or the dad
draws something to keep the bird

2ce6882e-b2dc-4200-8c90-d7d9aafc42d3-4
01:18:02.436 --> 01:18:02.850
safe.

23968940-a505-479e-bf59-1079da74ce94-0
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.670
Um, which is a

be9d01ce-9e45-45c8-a7be-9c2f9d24dad5-0
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.826
It's a contract contraption that
as the guard or the evil knight

be9d01ce-9e45-45c8-a7be-9c2f9d24dad5-1
01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:23.035
comes forward to go capture the
pink bird, the pink bird that's

be9d01ce-9e45-45c8-a7be-9c2f9d24dad5-2
01:18:23.035 --> 01:18:28.759
caught inside of his like
spinning box, but he gets caught

be9d01ce-9e45-45c8-a7be-9c2f9d24dad5-3
01:18:28.759 --> 01:18:34.677
inside of the cage and all the
walls of the cage come up and

be9d01ce-9e45-45c8-a7be-9c2f9d24dad5-4
01:18:34.677 --> 01:18:40.110
the dad gets he gets in
possession of the knight's box.

449e127b-290d-4e79-a58c-a9ba9524f899-0
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.160
And the night is trapped in the
cage.

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-0
01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:51.364
Umm, so the dad breaks the box
and everything comes out. All of

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-1
01:18:51.364 --> 01:18:56.268
the magic markers come out. The
Griffin is comes back, the bird

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-2
01:18:56.268 --> 01:19:00.177
comes back out. We see a
butterfly, we see several

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-3
01:19:00.177 --> 01:19:05.005
insects. We see a green rainbow,
a yellow rainbow, red. All of

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-4
01:19:05.005 --> 01:19:09.986
the colors are unleashed and and
left back out. And the king and

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-5
01:19:09.986 --> 01:19:14.814
the little boy are amazed that
they're both up, back out, that

e15bad9b-2f33-4c7f-bfb0-7daf0e032e46-6
01:19:14.814 --> 01:19:16.499
everything's back out.

f9922d46-88ee-42ec-bb19-d75d0db29bb1-0
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.250
Of the box.

22eddf23-b481-4dec-9f6c-c5889aa0d099-0
01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:27.218
Umm so the Griffin then takes
the man, then evil knight in

22eddf23-b481-4dec-9f6c-c5889aa0d099-1
01:19:27.218 --> 01:19:27.650
his.

0507dbe6-23a6-485d-a9d8-afc997949b3a-0
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:33.758
Cage and all of the birds and
the Griffin migrate back towards

0507dbe6-23a6-485d-a9d8-afc997949b3a-1
01:19:33.758 --> 01:19:38.865
the Kingdom. The octopus and all
of the guards go back, as well

0507dbe6-23a6-485d-a9d8-afc997949b3a-2
01:19:38.865 --> 01:19:44.133
as the king, the little boy, the
little girl and her dad. All are

0507dbe6-23a6-485d-a9d8-afc997949b3a-3
01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:49.241
in safety. The little girl hugs
her father. She's so happy that

0507dbe6-23a6-485d-a9d8-afc997949b3a-4
01:19:49.241 --> 01:19:54.269
he came to play with her and we
see the end of the kite, which

0507dbe6-23a6-485d-a9d8-afc997949b3a-5
01:19:54.269 --> 01:19:58.100
means that that is the way back
to their house.

7abb783a-f73f-41f6-bc67-0e95b9c755e0-0
01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:01.730
Umm.

32c0cdde-e690-4470-bd43-6613ef7a6d3a-0
01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.662
So they come back in to their
house. You see the light in that

32c0cdde-e690-4470-bd43-6613ef7a6d3a-1
01:20:06.662 --> 01:20:10.731
in her dad's office from the
little door that opens up there

32c0cdde-e690-4470-bd43-6613ef7a6d3a-2
01:20:10.731 --> 01:20:14.533
and we see the kite that is now
being played with by I'm

32c0cdde-e690-4470-bd43-6613ef7a6d3a-3
01:20:14.533 --> 01:20:18.535
assuming them as they go out
into the world to go play with

32c0cdde-e690-4470-bd43-6613ef7a6d3a-4
01:20:18.535 --> 01:20:20.070
their kite. #END_return

4262253f-45a9-4147-8984-356ce4f89e7c-0
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.870
So that was the story.

231009dc-b568-4d66-b935-9c5a73c3bc15-0
01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:28.090
We have two more. Let me just
open those.

f39c9569-9628-4719-89e4-fab89dd96d05-0
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:30.920
Just a minute.

bcdb51a3-de31-418a-b7a9-7e956d387e49-0
01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:50.960


1c8c77c8-ba73-41cd-8d97-f3d6920300f4-0
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.790
OK.

3de5f09f-bc90-4732-8ad2-399b451fbd43-0
01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:09.130
The next one will be a complex
scene.

147451e9-e198-4e5c-ba43-c3f0b880efb9-0
01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.310
Again, please describe.

9c662563-60bc-4371-bce1-6bbdab8d18dd-0
01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:35.650
This scene what you see and what
is happening.

460e1604-a05b-42cf-91f3-d54ae7c56441-0
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.250
Well, I think this is the first
one we did.

8240b45f-0587-47ad-867e-8a22eb645efb-0
01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:41.870
Ohh wait.

dc3b17e9-e84e-4e25-bc70-da940f9f5a3d-0
01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.110
You are right.

26992149-5f18-4907-9837-cd342548d547-0
01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:52.560
OK, I wasn't sure if I was like,
oh, do we redo them?

8595cfc6-803d-40e0-a23d-8927df4f8209-0
01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:59.284
No, I don't think so. That's
because it's a little out of

8595cfc6-803d-40e0-a23d-8927df4f8209-1
01:21:59.284 --> 01:22:03.090
order. Thank you for
remembering, of course.

7c4cc5ad-26c9-47e0-8cb3-ba8ea0f95524-0
01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.030
The last two, here we go.

de38b6ca-e2f8-4378-b989-7189262cb942-0
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.480
Two scenes.

cbba15c1-9b03-439b-98de-4fd769cadfbc-0
01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:45.140


4d361de2-3074-41fc-be74-ae255e95acce-0
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.630
OK.

05a4cfd1-d409-44a5-9216-f414aef3849b-0
01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.950
#START_being_a_pirate Alright,
so this is.

49683b74-9b4b-4a42-9b83-609993a6f86b-0
01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:03.970
a Scene of pirates.

443f2f0c-38fb-4825-bf53-486d8cb02602-0
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.710
Um we see.

0441de88-7bb5-40d6-8c50-9913b76d96d7-0
01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:10.260
Two major pirate ships.

73ec8789-06de-4544-8fd2-2a11bc3228be-0
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:17.538
Yeah, so one of them could just
be a regular ship that is

73ec8789-06de-4544-8fd2-2a11bc3228be-1
01:23:17.538 --> 01:23:21.856
against the pirates. So we see
one ship and one ship that has

73ec8789-06de-4544-8fd2-2a11bc3228be-2
01:23:21.856 --> 01:23:26.034
skulls that are crossed on it.
So we assume that that's the

73ec8789-06de-4544-8fd2-2a11bc3228be-3
01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:26.870
pirate ship.

a7c9e343-836f-40de-b312-acacb0a46eb4-0
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.120
Um and.

f47d6cd1-035e-49bc-a9a2-d9563898da9b-0
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:34.680
There are several boats.

927f23a2-5fad-49ec-81b1-9f5e820f6edf-0
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.180
That are all coming towards.

6de51907-8b57-405c-9eb1-08cb0341fb86-0
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:42.449
The one ship to board, so
they're all coming to board and

6de51907-8b57-405c-9eb1-08cb0341fb86-1
01:23:42.449 --> 01:23:44.740
attack like each other's ship.

1fed73de-6b3f-4be4-99dc-bf5385ca4697-0
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.624
Um, there are cannons that are
going off to shoot down those

1fed73de-6b3f-4be4-99dc-bf5385ca4697-1
01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:50.040
ships.

c0e4dffe-c06b-4e38-abae-8dfc1d14797a-0
01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:55.453
Um, there are several that have
sunk already, and the people are

c0e4dffe-c06b-4e38-abae-8dfc1d14797a-1
01:23:55.453 --> 01:23:59.920
in the water. There's an octopus
in the middle of the picture

c0e4dffe-c06b-4e38-abae-8dfc1d14797a-2
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.730
that has picked up two of the
pirates.

0f4249e2-9538-4a25-8352-7c87fd9b220e-0
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:09.247
Umm, we can almost kind of
understand or I don't even know

0f4249e2-9538-4a25-8352-7c87fd9b220e-1
01:24:09.247 --> 01:24:14.769
because some of the some of the
boats have flags as well.

0f4249e2-9538-4a25-8352-7c87fd9b220e-2
01:24:14.769 --> 01:24:19.719
They're skull cro. They are
skulls with crossbones.

d308c692-d9da-4395-b958-15fdd9faf760-0
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:24.360
And so they're about two of the
littler ships.

014d288d-68bf-44d3-ba87-94957af6b3f2-0
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.930
The smaller ships have.

4f513f15-27c0-4eae-8ad1-e3368c19ad9b-0
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.190
The the flag.

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:38.950
So on the beach there are people
that are digging for treasure

3784598d-d75b-4d68-8ff3-792b15b9dc40-1
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:43.696
and they seem to have found some
because they've opened it up and

3784598d-d75b-4d68-8ff3-792b15b9dc40-2
01:24:43.696 --> 01:24:48.155
it's nothing, there's nothing in
there. So they're going back

3784598d-d75b-4d68-8ff3-792b15b9dc40-3
01:24:48.155 --> 01:24:49.090
into the sea.

01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:59.728
Attire that are jumping into the
sea to save, either to escape

9b29d4fd-c6ce-4e49-94d3-f09c9503c565-1
01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:04.648
going to the beach or escape the
pirates, but they're jumping

9b29d4fd-c6ce-4e49-94d3-f09c9503c565-2
01:25:04.648 --> 01:25:05.679
into the sea.

a439663a-eb33-4ead-81c0-23bb0c8b3faf-0
01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:16.125
We see a pirate ship off to the
farthest right corner. There's

a439663a-eb33-4ead-81c0-23bb0c8b3faf-1
01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:22.222
another pirate ship with red
designing and another Black Flag

a439663a-eb33-4ead-81c0-23bb0c8b3faf-2
01:25:22.222 --> 01:25:28.319
with a skull, but with a skull
and crossbones on the flag and

a439663a-eb33-4ead-81c0-23bb0c8b3faf-3

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.408
They not escaping, but they're
pirates that have gotten off of

15b348a2-0168-42e7-9869-c45b0a27e6b9-1
01:25:44.408 --> 01:25:47.090
the boat that are going now to
attack another boat.

We there is a cannonball that is
shot from one of the.

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.932
The smaller boat that ends up
shooting up into the crow's nest

1f384ce6-c05f-4fb8-b0c3-f287e468b162-1
01:25:59.932 --> 01:26:04.553
of the big ship. This is to the
right middle of the page. A

1f384ce6-c05f-4fb8-b0c3-f287e468b162-2
01:26:04.553 --> 01:26:09.482
cannonball has knocked several
of the people off. Umm. And then

1f384ce6-c05f-4fb8-b0c3-f287e468b162-3
01:26:09.482 --> 01:26:12.640
there are some pirates that are
pushing.

fe1b834d-e98b-42fa-b470-b855bf8d42b2-0
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:21.515
The people that are just regular
sailors off of the crow's nest,

fe1b834d-e98b-42fa-b470-b855bf8d42b2-1
01:26:21.515 --> 01:26:28.392
we can see that the crow's nest
has or the top of the ship has

fe1b834d-e98b-42fa-b470-b855bf8d42b2-2
01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:35.160
white and blue striped flag. So
we can decipher that the blue

fe1b834d-e98b-42fa-b470-b855bf8d42b2-3
01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.890

Sailors. Those are the good
sailors and not the pirates.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.290
We see several people on the
mast

56cc8ae7-cc4c-44d3-8b3d-f9624ca8cdcc-0
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:53.520

one another.

01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:04.935
There is another cannonball that
has escaped from the pirate ship

3873c14e-37c3-4c0d-a6a1-19d2bf2e13e2-1
01:27:04.935 --> 01:27:09.820
and knocked out a group of
escaping sailors all the way to

3873c14e-37c3-4c0d-a6a1-19d2bf2e13e2-2
01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:14.788

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:29.366
We see that they have the
sailors have cannons as well as

9842f863-9246-4e71-932a-6b147fee8efc-1
01:27:29.366 --> 01:27:35.189

hanging on rope and kind of

ce2cbf8d-ddf9-4736-a466-09fb0cb0d4d9-1
01:27:49.493 --> 01:27:52.000

Alright.

#START_make_a_splash So this is
a amusement water park.

different types of water slides.
There's a green water slide, a

01:28:37.076 --> 01:28:42.276
yellow water slide, and a red

Um, there's a pirate ship with
the big yellow slide and water

01:28:55.506 --> 01:29:00.108
guns that people can squirt
water off of into people below

01:29:00.108 --> 01:29:05.022

01:29:10.014 --> 01:29:15.084

red buoy, and her hat that she's

590d8411-88ea-4a34-b035-aec574e5e4b0-5
01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:19.452
a little lifeguard as she
watches on. Behind the pirate

Lazy river of some sort where
people are laying in their tubes

69d74192-5a7d-43f7-8359-1bd47ebcca57-1
01:29:25.005 --> 01:29:27.090

There is a path from throughout.
There's like a a cement path

2760fed8-122d-4b01-97a8-9a9b182230b8-1
01:30:04.374 --> 01:30:09.290

break in the cement, so you have
to cross over the wooden planks

f4393629-0f5a-4e16-ba5b-fcd5706706a1-2
01:30:18.985 --> 01:30:20.070

In comparison to the other water
side, the water looked to be

de149992-9718-4188-bc63-c2aa189276b7-1
01:30:39.738 --> 01:30:40.530

Patch of grass, for people to
lay on. People are walking or

01:31:47.032 --> 01:31:50.630

01:31:57.167 --> 01:32:01.923

01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:27.406
Umm, there are palm trees all

There's a Penguin going right

01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:50.090
There's a Penguin floating in
