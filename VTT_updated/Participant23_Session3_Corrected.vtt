00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.900
{Alright, so continuing with our
study.

7917e422-0f18-4cd2-87ff-a99c57ff08f5-0
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.408
This item is a complex scene, so
like before, just describe what

7917e422-0f18-4cd2-87ff-a99c57ff08f5-1
00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:17.476
you see and what is happening in
between three and five minutes.

7917e422-0f18-4cd2-87ff-a99c57ff08f5-2
00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:18.099
OK, go.}

983b9504-73db-4694-baf4-938f6ba8f9ab-0
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.776
#START_being_a_pirate So this is
a scene once again. There's a

983b9504-73db-4694-baf4-938f6ba8f9ab-1
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:34.075
lot of lot of people on 2 pages.
It takes place on an ocean.

983b9504-73db-4694-baf4-938f6ba8f9ab-2
00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:38.000
There's a an island to the right
and.

a3ed1796-902b-4338-b51e-cb4850210d5b-0
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.750
A very large ship.

b14a49d2-eac2-4bef-a148-31a819707bdb-0
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.840
As well as a number of smaller
ships that transport people back

b14a49d2-eac2-4bef-a148-31a819707bdb-1
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.248
and forth to the main ship.
Actually, there's actually

b14a49d2-eac2-4bef-a148-31a819707bdb-2
00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:56.298
another ship that looks quite
large on the left to the left of

b14a49d2-eac2-4bef-a148-31a819707bdb-3
00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:57.020
the page.

41784f3b-8a50-4aac-8619-00a60b95ae0c-0
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.020
It has a pirates.

fc0b7bee-7d1d-4637-9c7d-69893a50f9d3-0
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.680
Flag.

8da8e28d-79ae-4fdd-afdf-6e5a8d10c2ac-0
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.550
So maybe this is like a battle
between two pirates.

bdd2fa28-116f-4d11-9d9b-8a715efcade5-0
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.760
There's some cannons being
launched.

0412e71e-84b3-4865-8765-e755558f0a46-0
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.200
Umm.

f82fdfa0-a6b0-4e29-a92b-e92e202b5e7c-0
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.150
From the large ship as well as
from a small ship.

e924f9a9-36ff-4351-8c70-25a4b03746b4-0
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.830
Um, most of the pictures are.

f35a8438-6200-41a5-a6db-9b2ecc2b7da9-0
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.670
Of men.

70312151-c045-47dd-a50b-13d4ac316f7a-0
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.828
Umm, actually, I I take that
back. There's actually another

70312151-c045-47dd-a50b-13d4ac316f7a-1
00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:38.159
ship up to the top, so there's
actually three main ships that

70312151-c045-47dd-a50b-13d4ac316f7a-2
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.490
have the pirate signs flags. So
that looks to be maybe like a

70312151-c045-47dd-a50b-13d4ac316f7a-3
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.780
battle between.

5959dc89-0dc2-4394-9388-50dbf243c3f0-0
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.570
I guess the groups.

7e1e0fb6-ddf6-43e9-979b-b47fee545daf-0
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.274
Looks like sex. Yes, there's
some cannons being launched.

7e1e0fb6-ddf6-43e9-979b-b47fee545daf-1
00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:58.506
There's a big octopus that's
actually showing its face in the

7e1e0fb6-ddf6-43e9-979b-b47fee545daf-2
00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.110
middle of the page.

cddbae78-2ae0-4272-858b-baf0f3758fb9-0
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.390
Holding some of the.

d865d58c-9b9c-4ff5-b952-3de8096383f1-0
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.530
Ohh.

37633836-e621-4753-ab06-150c81dbbddc-0
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.890
Fighters, the fighters aren't
really well.

ff8d4d0b-9dbe-4583-b525-6cda6faf8249-0
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.210
Clothed they're just wearing
simple clothes.

3d6df4ab-5158-44f2-94b9-447f124708bc-0
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.140
I guess most of the pirates are
like that.

464c14cc-b867-41e6-9299-d744918d697c-0
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.402
There's a lot of people at the
on the ship that are are on on

464c14cc-b867-41e6-9299-d744918d697c-1
00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:34.327
the ship parts as well as at the
top of the ships examining

464c14cc-b867-41e6-9299-d744918d697c-2
00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:35.710
distances and.

b755c730-5dd6-49e1-8099-139224889a49-0
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.220
Um, trying to fight

ffa4a408-a959-4dee-8019-408aae7e9496-0
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.800
As well on the on the.

cda9a31a-1d48-45e0-b1ca-fa3e7ee4fae2-0
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.507
I don't know what they call
these ships, but I guess where

cda9a31a-1d48-45e0-b1ca-fa3e7ee4fae2-1
00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:50.560
the the wind catches the sails.

edcb0300-d787-4883-8552-f76907bea19c-0
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.124
To the right, there's an island
that's colored in yellow. Some

edcb0300-d787-4883-8552-f76907bea19c-1
00:02:58.124 --> 00:03:03.913
people have landed on an island.
There's one person who's digging

edcb0300-d787-4883-8552-f76907bea19c-2
00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:04.790
a hole or.

8b510a94-248b-4a03-b862-33917e5bc2e7-0
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.892
He has just dug a hole and to
see if there was a treasure so

8b510a94-248b-4a03-b862-33917e5bc2e7-1
00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:14.031
that some people are sitting
around a treasure box that looks

8b510a94-248b-4a03-b862-33917e5bc2e7-2
00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:15.300
empty and he looks.

6aa5a11f-a8ab-48b8-a578-fa5e8a8c1bb3-0
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.660
Umm.

0c3678b5-6442-47f1-afeb-8cdef01f28eb-0
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.599
He looks a little puzzled. I
don't know if that was the

0c3678b5-6442-47f1-afeb-8cdef01f28eb-1
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.480
ultimate goal of these people is
to find treasures.

2bba5df8-e2d9-4bee-80c6-bc6dc066ad77-0
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.020
Umm.

0d27c6f1-6202-4fc5-aea5-b0acd3360463-0
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.103
There's also a lot of people
diving in and out of the water.

0d27c6f1-6202-4fc5-aea5-b0acd3360463-1
00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:37.910
There's actually two small boats
that seem to have sunk.

906fae7a-2f59-4647-a8ea-2bafa3ef704f-0
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.180
But um.

ec153d64-e47a-42b6-98c7-dcf42cce9373-0
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.609
I would think that most people
can swim if they are involved

ec153d64-e47a-42b6-98c7-dcf42cce9373-1
00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:48.850
in.

ddcc881e-18a6-4d2f-8662-5557b7d98e55-0
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.080
Being on the ship and being part
of a pirates.

2c140950-20ad-418d-92fa-2e1c51954819-0
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.430
But I do see one or two people
raising their hands.

554f5b4e-0209-48d7-9a87-9e442308847c-0
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.010
Um, to be rescued, um.

bc09a660-6461-4b39-9f84-a0298830b091-0
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.870
There is. Oh, I see there is
one.

249a1839-6b86-45fe-a3b0-9699c1bae643-0
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.675
Person who is being pushed on
the small ship at the top of

249a1839-6b86-45fe-a3b0-9699c1bae643-1
00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:16.110
the.

7a384511-ee57-4dca-ba2f-4bde832afed6-0
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.233
The page there is one person who
is at the edge of this ship. He

7a384511-ee57-4dca-ba2f-4bde832afed6-1
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:27.519
has no place else to go because
there is a pirate with a sword

7a384511-ee57-4dca-ba2f-4bde832afed6-2
00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:32.552
and it looks as though at the he
could jump into the water,

7a384511-ee57-4dca-ba2f-4bde832afed6-3
00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:38.090
except there are sharks close as
though they're ready to eat him.

7a384511-ee57-4dca-ba2f-4bde832afed6-4
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.375
So he looks as though he's kind
of in a bad situation, doesn't

7a384511-ee57-4dca-ba2f-4bde832afed6-5
00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.970
know where to turn.

976f049d-c6f3-4b9e-8029-af2cc94d4ba7-0
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.140
There are, um.

d58379a3-7308-4ec7-9906-634a8233a88d-0
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.243
They're they're mostly battle
scenes that are taking place,

d58379a3-7308-4ec7-9906-634a8233a88d-1
00:04:57.243 --> 00:05:01.220
people falling off, people
falling in. It's very chaotic.

64405a5c-37f9-4019-8134-3e1970fd8183-0
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.510
So there's no one.

3cae5b53-2662-4200-bfbd-4958c8d847de-0
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.350
Picture or one person that seems
to be.

e9445bce-b6c6-47db-a390-cb55012eb177-0
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.081
#END_being_a_pirate If they're
not in the boat, they're mostly

e9445bce-b6c6-47db-a390-cb55012eb177-1
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:16.989
moving and doing some kind of
examination and assessing their

e9445bce-b6c6-47db-a390-cb55012eb177-2
00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:17.620
situation.

75f52a29-ac1e-4af4-860a-e7369cc0a0af-0
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.320
{Alright, so that was about 5
minutes. Good.}

0a623026-55ff-44fc-9920-fbb22d29c43f-0
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.345
{So the next one is the same
type of pictures. OK, complex

0a623026-55ff-44fc-9920-fbb22d29c43f-1
00:05:28.345 --> 00:05:29.310
scene, so.}

0b6d2ea5-628c-4e0b-8290-7b4f7b74b75c-0
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.037
#START_wild_west So this is the
left. It talks about the wild

0b6d2ea5-628c-4e0b-8290-7b4f7b74b75c-1
00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.410
Wild West. Also lots of. Lots
of.

4a0f9581-0410-45ea-8eba-77ca917f0b43-0
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.970
Lots of people.

5e58b9cf-49f2-4aef-823d-01d47f1d8502-0
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.240
Oh, but it actually looks like
it is. It doesn't take place.

7416a205-3c62-45e5-932e-2210705ce908-0
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.600
Back in the time when there were
Cowboys but.

5f08b0a1-0b39-44c9-91be-b54dc49b0423-0
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.694
It looks as though it's a set
scene for films because we see

5f08b0a1-0b39-44c9-91be-b54dc49b0423-1
00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:04.292
people who are dressed as
Cowboys, but also people who are

5f08b0a1-0b39-44c9-91be-b54dc49b0423-2
00:06:04.292 --> 00:06:05.149
dressed in.

ccfdb41d-5bf0-4fb2-a293-47e91770fbc8-0
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.370
Regular modern clothes.

26d213cc-abc8-479a-b57e-9a0c7f5703e5-0
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.454
It takes place in a setting that
looks as though it is in a a

26d213cc-abc8-479a-b57e-9a0c7f5703e5-1
00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:22.380
town that takes place in the
Wild West.

4a7ae123-2cc0-41e5-90b5-e4b21f4d9bd5-0
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.890
Um, because there are jails and
hotels saloons.

dafdf394-2fe7-43fb-a730-a6e9197f6624-0
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.090
Banks. Oh, there's also a train.

495df830-4089-448e-a30f-8b3885c2e977-0
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.250
That's coming into the town.

1d9980aa-4ce7-4ec8-b5f8-1496aebfba18-0
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.410
Um, so there's a lot of saloons.
I guess that's just bars.

8294f514-31d3-4f1b-960f-6099b93a48f6-0
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.277
There's also a stable that
people could take care of their

8294f514-31d3-4f1b-960f-6099b93a48f6-1
00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:46.300
animal, which is.

412115ce-a648-4078-9e57-a2ba6f83210d-0
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.609
Um, mostly there aren't that.
There are a few animals that are

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:55.100
in the picture.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.152
But I would think that having
animals on the set is is could

d64af558-b3ed-4f2d-980c-959e8231a027-1
00:07:01.152 --> 00:07:04.650
be quite expensive and quite
chaotic, so I do see.

6a11ae6c-bfbd-44c1-8b2a-1f68d9eb7599-0
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.420
Sort of replicas of.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.700
There's an image of a group of
of of.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.750
Of buffaloes.

c48877f7-ddb2-4b3d-b11e-e4462dbb197d-0
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.660
That are coming as though
they're coming into town, but

c48877f7-ddb2-4b3d-b11e-e4462dbb197d-1
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.864
they're they're fake buffaloes
because I think that would be

c48877f7-ddb2-4b3d-b11e-e4462dbb197d-2
00:07:23.864 --> 00:07:24.830
quite chaotic.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.980
There's some.

9d87e25e-93d1-4ce2-9154-b987f41cbf75-0
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.516
Fighting scenes that are taking
place in saloon where most

9d87e25e-93d1-4ce2-9154-b987f41cbf75-1
00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:32.970
people.

2121d12b-6401-43de-8964-94dd135d1dc9-0
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.008
Or fighting between the 1st
floor and the 2nd floor, and

2121d12b-6401-43de-8964-94dd135d1dc9-1
00:07:40.008 --> 00:07:45.079
there's a cameraman and also
somebody holding a mic to get

2121d12b-6401-43de-8964-94dd135d1dc9-2
00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:47.400
the conversation on record.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.770
There's actually a.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.540
A movie scene where

74e950b9-57fc-40e6-a2bc-b0b2bee028ae-0
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.780
There's a bunch of bandits that
are trying to steal.

07508fea-8378-47b2-b961-a5c0125addeb-0
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.180
Carriages.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.700
Oh, it's actually a carriage
that's stuck.

5571e63c-883b-4729-bcba-e4193ef025de-0
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.540
On a the train track. Although
the train track is probably fake

5571e63c-883b-4729-bcba-e4193ef025de-1
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.295
too, so there's like multiple
scenes that are happening. Oh, I

5571e63c-883b-4729-bcba-e4193ef025de-2
00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:20.900
think I finally found Waldo for
the first time. He's to the.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.404
He's kind of underneath one of
the banks in the right hand

16f280ff-867b-4ebd-9ef6-ea6d0d74c07d-1
00:08:27.404 --> 00:08:30.280

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.440
There are mostly men who are in
this picture who are dressed as

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.600
Cowboys. Occasionally you see
some females.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.140
Very few.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.250
I guess because it's.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.390
Oh, there's a couple of fighting
scenes.

face300e-a848-436a-9ac3-dcbd1638a50d-0
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.370

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:08.388
There's a couple of to the back.
There's actually some singing

44bff6c9-197f-440d-b63d-e460c697de05-1
00:09:08.388 --> 00:09:15.070
that's going on back middle part
of the the page at the the 2nd

44bff6c9-197f-440d-b63d-e460c697de05-2

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.611
There's a person who looks as
though he's about to take off

923e8df4-b6fc-4ef4-8622-c0577a0e0f21-1
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:31.300
saying goodbye and I guess the
image of the sunset in the

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.848
A picture that they're trying to
take. Although I don't see the

89d161ef-1601-478b-a49a-42d03deabee7-1
00:09:39.848 --> 00:09:41.650

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.150
The big doctors.

near near the.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.370
The big picture of the sunset or
the sunset

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.350
Near the livery unstable
building.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:11.360

corner there is a jail.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.703
But there's a picture of a group
of Cowboys with a baby in a

49febcb8-4fed-4eed-a3cc-20e64fbbdd78-0
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.940
I guess back then they had
strollers.

9fd4e29a-76cc-43ab-afe5-26a3b66eeeac-0
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.170
#END_wild_west Um, or it's a
modern stroller.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.769
Moving on. So this one is the
longest graphic novel that we

88e9b6ba-492a-46bb-9e29-186d5f8025b7-1
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:41.070

{OK, so this is a new one. Yes.
And it's a graphic novel with

906df4e9-eddb-4bb4-9e49-56929c5f208d-1
00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:57.590
multiple pages. OK, so.}

The right side is just one large
image of a big ship.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.000
That is floating.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.872
To start off, from their left
hand side, there are two

ac96a2ae-3dc0-4c95-b3f6-f8e480a22883-1
00:11:22.872 --> 00:11:27.469
creatures, two people. One
person is dressed like a

ac96a2ae-3dc0-4c95-b3f6-f8e480a22883-2
00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:29.680
superhero kind of outfit.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.775
And the other person looks more
like a normal person human

5b4b38ba-5320-49d2-b55a-d68eb56eb0e2-1
00:11:35.775 --> 00:11:41.194
being. Though he may be having
and he's wearing like a striped

they're doing origami. A very

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:47.989
large scale origami.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.560
Trying to fold.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:57.250

folding together to build.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.524
But compared to how it is in
real life, it is still very

3fac3901-2e99-443d-a1c6-b7b7ac044dc7-1
00:12:09.524 --> 00:12:14.139
small because when you see it in
the context of the right side

3fac3901-2e99-443d-a1c6-b7b7ac044dc7-2
00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:18.533

And there the  in the origami
boat is actually heading

A direction with a bunch of
seagulls that are helping.

being also helped by three

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:00.970

helping.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.875
Ohh as well as the seagulls and
then all of a sudden they

464c1e01-5ccb-4500-a7bc-058083d907d6-1
00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:11.731

The fact that the will is close

Of the the ocean and the corals
and the the fish underneath the

ec61dda5-0ee7-4983-bb69-1adcb34e0e77-1
00:13:45.118 --> 00:13:50.702
water or reacting to the killer
whale approaching with the

ec61dda5-0ee7-4983-bb69-1adcb34e0e77-2
00:13:50.702 --> 00:13:52.880
origami ship on his fin

ef213823-0433-4342-b8f1-a57cda2f5a74-0
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.790
The now it looks as though the
origami ship is being.

9ab87804-0ea2-4611-84ba-6feb922fdd48-0
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.310
Navigated and moved by a school
of fish.

e8f09503-63dd-4260-a514-73b6f84385d3-0
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.710
A very large school of fish.

bb63fb57-9ab7-4bb5-84b9-291205aa5452-0
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.620
And the pages are.

81d9d29c-bc9d-43dd-8086-2fbb10e8c9b5-0
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.650
Still showing briefly the.

3c5a2990-7659-4185-a93e-622b9e0d642c-0
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.059
The origami ship, but mostly the
underground of what's happening.

3c5a2990-7659-4185-a93e-622b9e0d642c-1
00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:27.090
There's a lot of movements that
are taking place in the

3c5a2990-7659-4185-a93e-622b9e0d642c-2
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.480
underground with fish amidst the
corals, amidst the seaweed.

138a2efe-0e85-4745-81a9-d521442359b2-0
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.480
All different kinds of fish.

00cb178c-35aa-40a5-a74c-6fe4ea96a26a-0
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.890
The origami fish has now been.

227447f3-201b-406d-ba9d-db2f6eebbc38-0
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.820
Helped by.

8187961d-80e1-4ed2-ba4c-5c9153f0eae3-0
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.200
Some squid squid like.

f6214c8c-e4d6-45a5-9fe4-94ee6694c6ab-0
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.480
creatures

05256020-2d33-48f7-b0ec-a505a431e5d3-0
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.760
Um, still showing pictures of
the underground as well as the.

cf8a30ae-a98f-433e-aa33-a8bf596cda58-0
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.360
The the origami ship and
meanwhile the origami ship. It

cf8a30ae-a98f-433e-aa33-a8bf596cda58-1
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.197
looks as though there is
somebody in the origami ship

cf8a30ae-a98f-433e-aa33-a8bf596cda58-2
00:15:05.197 --> 00:15:09.533
because now there's a a rod
that's coming out, a fishing rod

cf8a30ae-a98f-433e-aa33-a8bf596cda58-3
00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:11.309
that's coming out of the.

f013a560-429f-4984-ab3c-6eb0d977e2b4-0
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:18.097
The origami ship, of which one
fish has taken bait and is about

f013a560-429f-4984-ab3c-6eb0d977e2b4-1
00:15:18.097 --> 00:15:20.000
to be dragged above.

0d9fce1e-5aff-4eac-a3d4-e5d9c0895dbb-0
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.370
Oh, interesting though.

18547b0b-8000-4bd9-abf5-040f81c06a3e-0
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.790
These these fish are kind of.

e257a8f2-158a-46ab-8905-77718a6942e6-0
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:33.732
I'm looking at them carefully.
Some are fish like and some are

e257a8f2-158a-46ab-8905-77718a6942e6-1
00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:38.455
almost half human, half fish.
There's a fish that is has a

e257a8f2-158a-46ab-8905-77718a6942e6-2
00:15:38.455 --> 00:15:43.658
scissor in his hand, which means
that he has hands, and he seems

e257a8f2-158a-46ab-8905-77718a6942e6-3
00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:46.060
to understand what's going on.

06642b9a-479a-46c7-9769-8845c6e3838f-0
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.590
That's interesting. OK.

3df16038-502e-4ae5-8e5f-eade4744acae-0
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.850
So there is a.

49635aea-d508-4e5d-87da-f1b6813abb8a-0
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.039
Horseshoe, no horse fish. I
think that's what they're called

49635aea-d508-4e5d-87da-f1b6813abb8a-1
00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:06.610
that is visible above the water.

4dea4d3f-f862-4782-a3be-3ff66848db8f-0
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.913
With a hat that is actually
being helped by another fish

4dea4d3f-f862-4782-a3be-3ff66848db8f-1
00:16:12.913 --> 00:16:18.056
that is being helped that as
he's standing on coral to be

4dea4d3f-f862-4782-a3be-3ff66848db8f-2
00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:19.120
above water.

27a63db3-8d46-4fad-99a8-c4028ee54a55-0
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.920
Um, the fish in the underwater
is.

1e0255ba-5ba0-4def-911e-73149d5bd003-0
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.430
Moving around.

80ccf8d1-d099-4d91-ba11-2860d5368403-0
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:35.646
I guess it was a way for the the
the origami ship to not get

80ccf8d1-d099-4d91-ba11-2860d5368403-1
00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:39.000
stuck by the the corals that
are.

5e4f4a9f-3000-4abd-8431-19ed5f4e3598-0
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.770
Higher above.

5eb4e670-b34e-4144-9510-6c0d8a539072-0
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:46.928
Closer to the water surface and
to the right there are. I think

5eb4e670-b34e-4144-9510-6c0d8a539072-1
00:16:46.928 --> 00:16:49.080
these are called Stingrays.

3e7a21e1-32b4-463d-a5b1-7d1db522588b-0
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:57.201
As well as eel like creatures at
the bottom of the ocean, that

3e7a21e1-32b4-463d-a5b1-7d1db522588b-1
00:16:57.201 --> 00:17:02.920
one of them a very long eel like
snake like creature.

b72af81a-f5fa-4280-97bd-9cd9a0b0a5cb-0
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:09.864
Has managed to actually get to
the top of the water surface and

b72af81a-f5fa-4280-97bd-9cd9a0b0a5cb-1
00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:15.339
even peek into the origami ship.
Meanwhile, the origami ship is

b72af81a-f5fa-4280-97bd-9cd9a0b0a5cb-2
00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.280
also being.

e287dfd5-6981-47b8-8f45-4f2609680be8-0
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.260
Navigated by the.

7d9f5155-0a11-40d8-889b-118008662063-0
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.225
Horse. Seahorse. I think that's
what they're called. I can't

7d9f5155-0a11-40d8-889b-118008662063-1
00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:30.590
remember seahorse, like with the
checkered body wearing a hat.

d2f9e5d7-de5e-47d2-8c9c-01124cfd47bc-0
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:43.162
So I'm imagining this is now at
the top of the above water

d2f9e5d7-de5e-47d2-8c9c-01124cfd47bc-1
00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:43.760
image.

59e12402-e822-481e-8054-8fd71e404a24-0
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:52.546
The the origami ship. It's about
to come across an island that is

59e12402-e822-481e-8054-8fd71e404a24-1
00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:59.496
mostly covered by large trees,
and on the trees there are crane

59e12402-e822-481e-8054-8fd71e404a24-2
00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:04.600
like Swan Lake creatures that
are on branches.

20f5fb43-a16b-4e93-877e-d2a6eed20bf6-0
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:12.450
And they seem to be busy eating
or nesting or.

e2fe0cdd-5389-49a5-a741-456be402b9bc-0
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.606
There are numerous cranes that
are on this Big Island that is

e2fe0cdd-5389-49a5-a741-456be402b9bc-1
00:18:19.606 --> 00:18:24.978
covered by trees and it looks as
though the origami ship is about

e2fe0cdd-5389-49a5-a741-456be402b9bc-2
00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:27.420
to sail in to possibly a cave.

b2afc5f5-2a83-434f-93f7-e70b4f9a858c-0
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:35.130
There's also flowers that are
showing above the sea water.

c6e8ff8c-e8e8-4f1c-818a-3aeb7a5f4cf7-0
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.230
Meanwhile.

b30e3e5e-19e1-49f0-a052-e290de02d3e4-0
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.390
As the origami ship enters The
Cave.

07ef5319-d377-430b-9784-c250c04736a5-0
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.274
The picture now shows above
water and below water activities

07ef5319-d377-430b-9784-c250c04736a5-1
00:18:50.274 --> 00:18:51.820
that are taking place.

18e4b948-0cba-4530-ba70-ef62e310a815-0
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.728
It shows that the water surface
is probably more shallow because

18e4b948-0cba-4530-ba70-ef62e310a815-1
00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:03.175
you can see the roots of these
trees that are underwater and

18e4b948-0cba-4530-ba70-ef62e310a815-2
00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:07.841
the fish are swimming in between
the roots. There's a school of

18e4b948-0cba-4530-ba70-ef62e310a815-3
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:10.829
fish that are also swimming
through the.

f42682ae-c9c2-4ee1-a418-d0703a2b590c-0
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:17.045
The the branches in between
trees under the water. There are

f42682ae-c9c2-4ee1-a418-d0703a2b590c-1
00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:21.426
some fish that are are
hibernating or sleeping in

f42682ae-c9c2-4ee1-a418-d0703a2b590c-2
00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:27.210
between these roots of the trees
and the origami ship is about to

f42682ae-c9c2-4ee1-a418-d0703a2b590c-3
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.030
enter I guess the jungle like
area of the tree island.

b68e110d-d844-48f4-8599-e74fcd717af7-0
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.488
So they're now different
creatures as the origami ship

b68e110d-d844-48f4-8599-e74fcd717af7-1
00:19:41.488 --> 00:19:42.710
sails through.

008a4431-4364-48b7-be54-f6b75eb8f11d-0
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:50.290
Kind of like a water channel in
in the middle of the.

7ee96db6-1477-436a-88c8-a454809aa987-0
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.433
Island Trees, tree islands. I
should call them trees islands.

7ee96db6-1477-436a-88c8-a454809aa987-1
00:19:57.433 --> 00:20:02.758
There's a couple of creatures
that are also on the branches

7ee96db6-1477-436a-88c8-a454809aa987-2
00:20:02.758 --> 00:20:04.090
they look like.

a1cc2fa0-1867-4f33-9352-ec8c18c02057-0
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.924
They seem to have faces similar
to fish, but they're not fish

a1cc2fa0-1867-4f33-9352-ec8c18c02057-1
00:20:10.924 --> 00:20:15.724
because they're above ground.
There are also some crabs as

a1cc2fa0-1867-4f33-9352-ec8c18c02057-2
00:20:15.724 --> 00:20:17.270
well as some birds.

a6f3a74e-b825-498b-9a15-8b85176f471b-0
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.320
Shows that.

a4bff596-b9c0-49b3-8a21-8995019851db-0
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.741
It's probably dark in this area
because all of the creatures

a4bff596-b9c0-49b3-8a21-8995019851db-1
00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:28.570
have eyes that are shining.

5f4cb73c-61b6-4c61-a0ff-398aa84cc6d0-0
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.680
or illuminating.

4be4ae0e-5311-441c-af1c-398b09f9d8cd-0
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:41.542
The picture again is now between
above water and underground

4be4ae0e-5311-441c-af1c-398b09f9d8cd-1
00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:45.230
water activities as the origami
ship sails.

6be37260-f50c-4a14-8e41-a79e8e34c076-0
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.010
Through the trees of this
island.

9ddeb317-bf44-4a41-bb6c-41da5f7057aa-0
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:56.458
On the left hand side there are
some more interesting creatures.

9ddeb317-bf44-4a41-bb6c-41da5f7057aa-1
00:20:56.458 --> 00:21:01.881
There's a very large lobster
that is crawling at the base of

9ddeb317-bf44-4a41-bb6c-41da5f7057aa-2
00:21:01.881 --> 00:21:02.770
the ocean.

f54eadc8-75ab-4fbd-9a77-69b2827143aa-0
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:11.542
And as a lot very large seahorse
is riding on top of the lobster,

f54eadc8-75ab-4fbd-9a77-69b2827143aa-1
00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:16.170
these look to be very, very big
creatures.

5df2293a-f8ff-47f6-87ff-f49231aa76ba-0
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.700
And it looks as though the.

1ff49b7c-f145-43c4-93c9-da80affbc42c-0
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.030
Seahorse on the boat of the
origami notices.

d525c03c-5400-4fca-8db4-1e2574f6dd89-0
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.890
The the large seahorse that's on
the lobster, that's underground.

564e502b-3860-4ae0-a7a6-26597e30f551-0
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:35.486
And on the right page he decides
to jump out of the origami boat,

564e502b-3860-4ae0-a7a6-26597e30f551-1
00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:39.940
his hats falling, but he sees
that there are some other.

da0a69a8-e3e1-403f-a083-779f683eb571-0
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.576
Family members of his sea horses
that are underground water

da0a69a8-e3e1-403f-a083-779f683eb571-1
00:21:44.576 --> 00:21:47.020
waiting for him to jump into the
water.

8beb06d3-8902-463f-9e87-610b0085ff5f-0
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.420
Um, the the origami.

78571937-a862-4e86-8610-23f01e7e5a28-0
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.710
Boat is continuing to sail.

48367feb-5695-4357-97f4-a3b4e251a0a1-0
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:09.278
This shows how small the origami
ship is compared to the killer

48367feb-5695-4357-97f4-a3b4e251a0a1-1
00:22:09.278 --> 00:22:12.210
whale that we saw originally.

f08600ad-cf9f-48c0-8b6d-ef5b4c82068a-0
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.971
There's a picture of the killer
whale in proportion to the

f08600ad-cf9f-48c0-8b6d-ef5b4c82068a-1
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:20.420
origami ship. The origami ship
is tiny.

a8c9213c-c74a-4230-99ed-6498645a034c-0
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.671
And the whale is just kind of
relaxing because it's smoking a

a8c9213c-c74a-4230-99ed-6498645a034c-1
00:22:25.671 --> 00:22:29.828
pipe and there are birds on top
of him. And he doesn't seem to

a8c9213c-c74a-4230-99ed-6498645a034c-2
00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:32.270
mind. He's not in a killer
instinct.

a69f70f7-3965-4f72-9550-4b24b88fb92e-0
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.220
And he's just floating in water.

92cfb8c1-49a1-405e-9fbc-aa748b879da8-0
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.146
And there are some fish in the
background, but it also shows

92cfb8c1-49a1-405e-9fbc-aa748b879da8-1
00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:46.392
how big he is in proportion to
everything else. On the right

92cfb8c1-49a1-405e-9fbc-aa748b879da8-2
00:22:46.392 --> 00:22:48.549
side there is another creature.

7102f903-7a41-4fff-ac9c-267235c76173-0
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.695
That is just as large as the
killer whale, but is very

7102f903-7a41-4fff-ac9c-267235c76173-1
00:22:52.695 --> 00:22:53.820
different looking.

359924ad-b4ec-425d-a2c3-a791456484df-0
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.040
It's got claws like crab.

41c6a29f-0833-4e62-befb-92e50cc5eabb-0
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:04.211
It's got multiple tails. It's
got some coral that's growing on

41c6a29f-0833-4e62-befb-92e50cc5eabb-1
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:05.020
his back.

c2001d1c-e1a1-47b6-859b-15cd4f3c1f95-0
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.052
And he's got a little he also is
very large in proportion to the

c2001d1c-e1a1-47b6-859b-15cd4f3c1f95-1
00:23:11.052 --> 00:23:12.330
origami ship also.

7d566dee-6ea5-441f-bf6d-acd5ef8ddd62-0
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.042
He is half mostly underwater,
but his head is floating above

7d566dee-6ea5-441f-bf6d-acd5ef8ddd62-1
00:23:18.042 --> 00:23:18.540
water.

1cb66a0d-e34c-45b9-9697-72c3d9987345-0
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.200
Talking to the origami ship.

0e89f6c7-9f75-42f6-b6d2-7fc3c496c4be-0
00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.480
And he is standing.

07ade34f-f8a8-4c37-be2c-131ffab87e5f-0
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.730
On a.

61d6ad50-a69d-44ce-a3fd-99c21e4a303b-0
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.616
Number of of the they look like
past ships that have failed and

61d6ad50-a69d-44ce-a3fd-99c21e4a303b-1
00:23:33.616 --> 00:23:37.826
are sunk. There's actually
another origami ship that is at

61d6ad50-a69d-44ce-a3fd-99c21e4a303b-2
00:23:37.826 --> 00:23:42.536
the bottom of the ocean as well.
That's amidst the ships that are

61d6ad50-a69d-44ce-a3fd-99c21e4a303b-3
00:23:42.536 --> 00:23:44.320
underneath this creature.

b8eba29f-3cbb-41bc-9d23-4c95f1c3b6ac-0
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.730
Now the origami ship is.

cbe145a2-1fca-4a4e-a02c-4129e6ec6eb6-0
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.240
Hitting.

de4f0762-f192-4d48-9b00-7c2d0295e414-0
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.126
Towards a destination actually
heading towards the moon, it

de4f0762-f192-4d48-9b00-7c2d0295e414-1
00:24:02.126 --> 00:24:06.524
looks like while there are all
these different creatures that

de4f0762-f192-4d48-9b00-7c2d0295e414-2
00:24:06.524 --> 00:24:10.710
no longer look just like fish,
but they look like hybrids.

9f70fc01-3c7e-44e4-83be-d15205ad6c9b-0
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.880
Of other animals.

0432ccd0-4065-4fd1-9691-bd072d06c339-0
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:21.379
There's an alligator. There's a
cat that has fins and tails.

0432ccd0-4065-4fd1-9691-bd072d06c339-1
00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:27.634
There's a dog that also has
tails as as his paws. There's a

0432ccd0-4065-4fd1-9691-bd072d06c339-2
00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:28.260
zebra.

93f44537-8365-48cd-a867-fa7eff2323d9-0
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.050
There's.

1df042ee-464d-407f-97f3-fe4bfb012368-0
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:37.100
A leopard with um hands that
look like tails.

aeaf2276-8352-4f72-8d47-bd2de0b0860e-0
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:43.080
There are elephants and lions
and other.

82e02095-1650-457d-8976-faef5a6ce998-0
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.998
Creatures that look like hybrids
of between a fish and well, I

82e02095-1650-457d-8976-faef5a6ce998-1
00:24:48.998 --> 00:24:52.020
think there's also a cow at the
back.

11aeb6b1-de83-4761-b7d1-50b07da63637-0
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.276
There's also a snake that's on
the surface of the horizon of

11aeb6b1-de83-4761-b7d1-50b07da63637-1
00:24:58.276 --> 00:24:59.050
the water.

d607260c-b33d-4ba3-9a58-85a750480599-0
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.075
With an image of a of a fish
that's glowing, illuminating

d607260c-b33d-4ba3-9a58-85a750480599-1
00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:10.121
light. And there are birds that
are also half fish, half

d607260c-b33d-4ba3-9a58-85a750480599-2
00:25:10.121 --> 00:25:11.450
butterfly half.

aea066d2-0f2c-455d-96ba-3405b027db95-0
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.600
Flying above the water.

e0ba5767-19f2-41f3-9b7f-16792c14074a-0
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.399
And there is a looks like a
moon, but the moon is also has

e0ba5767-19f2-41f3-9b7f-16792c14074a-1
00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:27.645
tails. There's also a bat that
looks like. It also has fish

e0ba5767-19f2-41f3-9b7f-16792c14074a-2
00:25:27.645 --> 00:25:28.520
like fins.

1f4f0240-9712-49d9-8380-fc218079d601-0
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.030
So the origami.

f7880895-128d-4e31-97bd-dfcae0155310-0
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.814
Ship continues its sale that
he's now. That ship is now

f7880895-128d-4e31-97bd-dfcae0155310-1
00:25:40.814 --> 00:25:45.700
heading towards a the moon,
which the moon is showing.

eaf7cdb0-bc26-459e-a107-be1314b2140f-0
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.070
A bit of illumination, but not
much because it is mostly.

14454296-776a-4481-b1c0-ec8b11de0080-0
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.190
Not a full moon.

d69a4ffb-9cc9-43cf-8b4f-90c8847caef3-0
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.010
I can't remember the opposite of
not a full moon and it shows

d69a4ffb-9cc9-43cf-8b4f-90c8847caef3-1
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.950
also the sky lit by.

fc9d3549-48cf-4fb2-b9a2-9112b6695587-0
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.190
Umm.

115d508a-36fa-44f1-9880-5e50a8217388-0
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.474
Some kind of creatures that are
flying in the in the night sky

115d508a-36fa-44f1-9880-5e50a8217388-1
00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:18.690
as well as the underground water
showing.

35d0ce0e-dc6a-4c7c-9ba8-4bfebc2d9998-0
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.750
Creatures that are swimming all
towards the origami ship.

629f1e3a-abf7-46ee-abc5-7b6822538712-0
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:30.140
All their eyes are illuminating
and heading in that direction.

dc232fd0-38b4-4089-b7af-4d2da96f2f1f-0
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.410
The origami ship is now
surrounded from all angles by.

cd5d4590-9282-47eb-a729-5b4621c9dfad-0
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.470
Numerous fish, all showing its
head.

6d2a831d-0f44-407e-be2a-b42769e2c0aa-0
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.570
Above water, their heads. Above
water.

35ddd0eb-ec85-49fd-9efd-c094e279b69d-0
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.512
They don't seem to be attacking,
but they just seem to be

35ddd0eb-ec85-49fd-9efd-c094e279b69d-1
00:26:51.512 --> 00:26:55.620
surrounding the origami ship to
the point that the origami ship

35ddd0eb-ec85-49fd-9efd-c094e279b69d-2
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.839
has no place to go.

b7823e5b-5a01-41ea-98f9-09c4d0e50db3-0
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:01.540
Then all of a sudden.

6b858f1b-c2e9-4334-a83d-4407ec96dc1a-0
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.820
The sky is lit.

2d7ff4ac-04e8-455c-bb79-caa58d74fe88-0
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.460
In a way that is very mystical.

8952f81c-7501-42e6-b488-0ca4b3e0f5ad-0
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.690
Almost like a aurora.

7d4ffb2e-3199-466c-9335-b85333e23ff8-0
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.260
Can't remember the full name
Aurora where the sky is

7d4ffb2e-3199-466c-9335-b85333e23ff8-1
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.495
illuminated in a certain way.
That means the stars I thought,

7d4ffb2e-3199-466c-9335-b85333e23ff8-2
00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:25.730
seemed to have scared most of
the fish that were surrounding.

6e19cc7b-f39f-4543-958c-cfd6784625b2-0
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.073
The origami ship. The origami
ship now seems to be able to

6e19cc7b-f39f-4543-958c-cfd6784625b2-1
00:27:31.073 --> 00:27:32.570
start sailing again.

76cd95f2-aa02-48f8-8aa0-300cdb15816b-0
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.400
Now the.

2c08fb92-643f-4b9c-a92b-a084a3227e40-0
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.450
The sea.

917d4324-c29f-4e09-a373-542b79533060-0
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:48.320
Level seems to be illuminated by
a looks like you and like an ice

917d4324-c29f-4e09-a373-542b79533060-1
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.500
block from.

9eeda6a1-13ab-48b5-aae6-46e8cee1586d-0
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:55.532
And Arctica, but I think it is
not cold because we are seeing

9eeda6a1-13ab-48b5-aae6-46e8cee1586d-1
00:27:55.532 --> 00:27:56.370
the waves.

479764c1-6d7a-4a53-886c-3fc23fec5c52-0
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.550
Of the ocean, but it is a very
large structure that is also

479764c1-6d7a-4a53-886c-3fc23fec5c52-1
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.900
illuminating.

0f0951ef-27ed-441c-b94a-6dd11d825a46-0
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.580
Above the water.

befff5ce-badc-44ca-98db-7a754eb52822-0
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:17.360
It looks like so it might be a
tunnel like area that the

befff5ce-badc-44ca-98db-7a754eb52822-1
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.833
origami ship is sailing into so
it continues to sail into the

befff5ce-badc-44ca-98db-7a754eb52822-2
00:28:23.833 --> 00:28:30.097
tunnel. There's another picture
on the right that shows the

befff5ce-badc-44ca-98db-7a754eb52822-3
00:28:30.097 --> 00:28:33.960
origami ship navigating through
the.

9fbf24f9-2b50-44f0-a333-9f2fbeeefdb1-0
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:35.900
Uh.

8415c663-f603-4b98-8c58-46dd760b171c-0
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.710
That's navigating you through
like a tunnel.

c2cb1a70-6715-447e-a646-6c875b0b9dc2-0
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.030
All of a sudden.

bcb1db75-36e5-4bcf-a24e-37025a48852b-0
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.510
Umm.

0e11bb78-a9a6-4c0f-adfb-8d6832baa346-0
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:54.800
This origami ship comes out of
the other end of the tunnel.

4f38c2b7-5216-41b6-9645-73ce88e1c809-0
00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.310
formed through the the ice block
like.

99362056-465e-44ee-961c-26289062cf32-0
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:06.140
Kind of natural setting and is
being illuminated.

48f36235-1667-41e8-8f7b-a61e479ae342-0
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.300
By another light from
underground turns out that.

39a32394-1d11-4273-ba58-036fbeb19c9f-0
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:13.760
Umm.

499084f2-c303-4c61-9d91-969c7ee6a779-0
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.040
A very large.

750ca4bc-e45d-45e9-a070-20965108eca2-0
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.670
Half.

0b7e64ec-1aad-4778-86da-f3cdf06d6cca-0
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.100
Human like, half fish like.

6acf2c7d-4a57-4cc1-bc7c-1f4e9f2f79aa-0
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:27.177
With an oxygen tank and
illuminating eyes seem to be

6acf2c7d-4a57-4cc1-bc7c-1f4e9f2f79aa-1
00:29:27.177 --> 00:29:30.250
able to hold the origami ship.

66737dca-5d78-4ced-9040-0dc16f5d009e-0
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.160
Umm.

a9009dfd-fa52-4b01-823a-8180cfadfdd3-0
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.950
It has. It looks as though.

fe60591c-ba27-48a0-b820-4600ee005304-0
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:37.590
The.

d23ef69c-21ad-49d4-81b7-fde5ef5e76d3-0
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.500
This creature is very large.

8e33ec22-9a43-4418-841b-4c71f3085187-0
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:49.705
Doesn't. Don't know if it's a
human, but it also has some fish

8e33ec22-9a43-4418-841b-4c71f3085187-1
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.710
traits to the face.

d8a4463e-646a-434a-8bb2-fc772d4fa516-0
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.459
And because I guess it's living
underwater, it's got permanent

d8a4463e-646a-434a-8bb2-fc772d4fa516-1
00:29:57.459 --> 00:29:58.370
oxygen tank.

cab6f9bd-8412-46f6-96e7-a194da942c5d-0
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.500
And I head

cae018b1-1409-42f7-a2fb-fcf73cd8dec3-0
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.680
Coverage.

9bb206cf-68fc-4111-aea6-e073e1afcd60-0
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:15.205
So the origami ship is really at
the corner of this page that

9bb206cf-68fc-4111-aea6-e073e1afcd60-1
00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:20.660
shows and the rest of the page
is it's almost like 2 ships.

ff3cf95c-673b-4937-a4f6-c9c6fc312274-0
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.292
They always, also look like
cities. They're so large in

ff3cf95c-673b-4937-a4f6-c9c6fc312274-1
00:30:25.292 --> 00:30:27.210
comparison to the origami ship.

dca57c0e-70b9-4025-af3b-d38e038456d3-0
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:33.053
The creature that picked up the
origami ship that is half human,

dca57c0e-70b9-4025-af3b-d38e038456d3-1
00:30:33.053 --> 00:30:34.240
half fish like.

6f3e8213-675b-45bb-811c-9c674936677e-0
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:40.524
Seems to be directing the
origami ship towards this city

6f3e8213-675b-45bb-811c-9c674936677e-1
00:30:40.524 --> 00:30:42.600
like ships that have.

67193a05-4875-4bf4-becd-fa30eeda79dc-0
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.800
That have.

4948b8ea-b713-43b0-be9c-46b89d2b0dc6-0
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:53.115
Big chimneys that look like
factories. There's also the tail

4948b8ea-b713-43b0-be9c-46b89d2b0dc6-1
00:30:53.115 --> 00:30:58.376
of the killer whale in between
the ships. It just shows how big

4948b8ea-b713-43b0-be9c-46b89d2b0dc6-2
00:30:58.376 --> 00:31:01.830
the ship is in comparison to the
origami.

11b8d2a2-cec6-43fd-aebd-085bcd32d143-0
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.370
Ship.

adcbfc4c-d88a-40d4-a7f4-b61d22f1ab28-0
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.580
Umm.

0c7141ce-917c-4d10-b815-35f1bb21034f-0
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.630
It's it's still heading towards
a.

a268ed1a-ff48-42f1-9470-012cd3e2dbb1-0
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.590
Another structure that has
numerous.

97bde3cd-acea-4d33-80d7-fce0d06cfa1e-0
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.465
Chimneys. There are birds that
are coming in and out of the

97bde3cd-acea-4d33-80d7-fce0d06cfa1e-1
00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:22.870
water.

ce43d45a-525e-4f3d-a331-fc48745337d8-0
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.990
Almost like raindrops.

7c34e791-ef36-4ac8-a911-302d7722b920-0
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.640
And the sky is actually being
polluted.

09c6044f-1460-45c0-ab49-9bb5ce6e9427-0
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.930
By the the smoke that's coming
out of the chimney.

d6d2fe2f-5b0f-477a-9f5a-c74d83b09c3e-0
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.120
Umm.

cc360210-62b3-4978-a7ba-86ea2e026d52-0
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.240
Now there's some.

b6d608bc-248d-4712-84d4-21cb90bec7e7-0
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.190
Activity that is more human like
in that there are.

dc2ec44a-de90-4521-9789-2dc34521ccfc-0
00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.090
Um, I guess the origami tree is
near one of the structures and.

3c5b58dc-b77d-47e0-babc-f6036d493d25-0
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:06.584
The origami tree as well as the
creatures in the water are being

3c5b58dc-b77d-47e0-babc-f6036d493d25-1
00:32:06.584 --> 00:32:07.580
attacked by.

bd09a886-6fc3-4e2d-b159-c896a73b72a3-0
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.560
The creatures that are in the
ship like buildings.

59339b01-8d5d-4711-bdcb-86527b404056-0
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.750
They are being attacked by.

0b952434-3986-4ed6-a541-f50ef67349a7-0
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.070
Pistol like.

dc2552db-946a-45da-92ed-592bc126642e-0
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:26.182
Objects, and one of the bullets
seemed to have pierced the

dc2552db-946a-45da-92ed-592bc126642e-1
00:32:26.182 --> 00:32:30.800
origami ship, and the origami
ship now has.

f80edbe4-0c80-43ab-a825-0f72f1c970a8-0
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.970
Is is going to rescue the

e994ac8f-3c03-46eb-9e0c-0dcc4699ad13-0
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.710
Human.

952fe526-5bc1-44eb-9d82-0cefe395166e-0
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:45.211
Fish like human from the rocket
that is that he was using to

952fe526-5bc1-44eb-9d82-0cefe395166e-1
00:32:45.211 --> 00:32:47.750
navigate himself above.

1a43f198-690a-42cf-8e4d-836bd7a07980-0
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.800
The seawater and he's about to
jump into the origami ship.

3cdb5db8-2fee-43c7-8063-ed57fb17ee11-0
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.940
There's a lot of turbulence in
the seeing right now.

00f9ba87-ad78-4a7f-8670-fa14368aa36b-0
00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.034
It looks as though there's
another fight scene that might

00f9ba87-ad78-4a7f-8670-fa14368aa36b-1
00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:07.570
take place.

0545e2c8-1fc0-49c0-99e9-7b467af24a51-0
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:14.470
Between the human like creature
that's trying to get onto the.

8d662679-4ae9-489a-8b99-f9c05382790b-0
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.280
origami ship

754068d9-c3a8-4c8d-b633-a3b810240627-0
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.992
Very simple compared to another
person, a human like creature

754068d9-c3a8-4c8d-b633-a3b810240627-1
00:33:22.992 --> 00:33:28.106
that has superhero like
qualities like he's wearing a

754068d9-c3a8-4c8d-b633-a3b810240627-2
00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:31.800
Cape, he's dressed almost like a
suit.

47d6ca25-00f7-4265-97ee-7423b0278d6a-0
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.369
Spiderman, like in his
positioning himself at the top

47d6ca25-00f7-4265-97ee-7423b0278d6a-1
00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:37.030
of a ship.

fdb55b07-ce3b-49e7-9fd6-4f939fa96794-0
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.760
That is also.

1b5a8728-c624-4287-8741-59b8e00723dd-0
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:47.405
It's not just himself alone, but
he has other creatures that are

1b5a8728-c624-4287-8741-59b8e00723dd-1
00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:52.140
half fish, half animal, like a
number of them that are.

795ef1b7-9917-494a-a3ae-2c05749cdc24-0
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.780
Heading towards the origami
ship.

2d3d191e-6679-4d4f-8c9b-d16da55fcab7-0
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.500
Meanwhile, the the ocean is now
become quite rough.

ee996faf-6dde-4707-b293-9c962b88c86a-0
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.953
There are huge waves, very large
waves, and the origami ship is

ee996faf-6dde-4707-b293-9c962b88c86a-1
00:34:12.953 --> 00:34:15.730
actually in the midst of a big.

897039c9-07bf-4b25-bd0c-02db196c410a-0
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.450
Umm.

3aa58591-3378-4de0-ac61-5ecac8d29b47-0
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:26.054
Tsunami like waves that's about
to engulf the origami ship.

3aa58591-3378-4de0-ac61-5ecac8d29b47-1
00:34:26.054 --> 00:34:29.890
Meanwhile the the attacker of
the ship.

67c5c9e8-3c65-4892-a235-17f505d4bb62-0
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.280
He is now.

e99fc7e0-9d1b-42ca-a3ef-e0c6644fdc09-0
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:39.000
Staying on the sidelines, he is
holding another origami like.

832c236f-8471-4ade-82fa-92afdcb55e3e-0
00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.823
Airplane in his hand and it
looks as though he's about to

832c236f-8471-4ade-82fa-92afdcb55e3e-1
00:34:45.823 --> 00:34:48.650
throw it towards the origami
ship.

1f8d78b7-2d10-4357-90d4-d2d133fbde9a-0
00:34:53.180 --> 00:35:00.226
Yeah, the the sea is still rough
but probably caused by nature as

1f8d78b7-2d10-4357-90d4-d2d133fbde9a-1
00:35:00.226 --> 00:35:06.632
there is a big Thunder and
lightning that's taking place, a

1f8d78b7-2d10-4357-90d4-d2d133fbde9a-2
00:35:06.632 --> 00:35:12.825
storm that's taking place.
Meanwhile the origami plane is

1f8d78b7-2d10-4357-90d4-d2d133fbde9a-3
00:35:12.825 --> 00:35:17.950
flying above seawater heading
into a direction.

f9cdb753-9312-43d1-8d39-639c65167941-0
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.280
Now the origami ship is going
through a maze of.

42d386e0-f6a7-47f8-a25e-576c7c9d6417-0
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.040
Small doughnut like.

e857a381-eff0-4808-b616-b71dbab7d89d-0
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.860
Holes.

6ecc428c-a0f0-49f6-ad08-4fac7a02f74e-0
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:39.630
Only to find out that these
doughnut like holes are made-up

6ecc428c-a0f0-49f6-ad08-4fac7a02f74e-1
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:43.960
of those creatures that look
like snails. No snakes.

2e44cf40-04db-4aae-a20a-c1894964dd0b-0
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:51.441
And it looks as though one of
these snails had not snake snake

2e44cf40-04db-4aae-a20a-c1894964dd0b-1
00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:52.880
head has grabbed.

051be578-b8d3-415b-b171-3e28e20b5678-0
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.320
The airplane.

4e7e3307-1629-4adf-98fc-4c2d255c3646-0
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.880
Origami.

59bee9a1-bdc7-4baf-a4e2-36cf2d334b73-0
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:07.582
Meanwhile, he the origami ship
is going through the the donut

59bee9a1-bdc7-4baf-a4e2-36cf2d334b73-1
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:14.243
area of the snake and is trying
to find its way outside to more

59bee9a1-bdc7-4baf-a4e2-36cf2d334b73-2
00:36:14.243 --> 00:36:15.180
open sea.

b6eca05c-19d1-443a-9a0c-7a530dbc04f4-0
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:23.301
He sees the opening and he then
encounters two other creatures

b6eca05c-19d1-443a-9a0c-7a530dbc04f4-1
00:36:23.301 --> 00:36:25.480
that are waiting for him.

6a17c83d-61b3-4b88-9421-fd5f32d67e90-0
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.960
These two other creatures.

6bc98605-f025-48f9-a92b-bdb19de6190a-0
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.090
Look like.

b9a91248-a099-404c-8827-13b34ebfa534-0
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:37.329
Whale, but not the normal whale
that we saw earlier on because

b9a91248-a099-404c-8827-13b34ebfa534-1
00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:39.020
it has like a Unicorn.

51245780-9df5-47cf-a7c6-4aebbac675eb-0
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.250
Um, Unicorn?

beb668d2-d2e9-4b17-b6c3-a6e0a34822e8-0
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.370
Unicorn.

a1cbf4ef-71b5-4c94-b192-ae8a1f6977f4-0
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.004
What is it called? And it's got
illuminated eyes, so it doesn't

a1cbf4ef-71b5-4c94-b192-ae8a1f6977f4-1
00:36:53.004 --> 00:36:56.344
look like real creature. It
doesn't look like normal real

a1cbf4ef-71b5-4c94-b192-ae8a1f6977f4-2
00:36:56.344 --> 00:36:56.920
creatures.

77d2e461-9235-40a1-884a-3637244e3551-0
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.370
But I what you see in
Fantasyland.

e840a32d-673a-44d5-9d35-c4b24a3fa592-0
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:10.017
He's spitting out water and it's
landing on the origami ship and

e840a32d-673a-44d5-9d35-c4b24a3fa592-1
00:37:10.017 --> 00:37:15.958
the origami ship because of that
my sink to the bottom of the

e840a32d-673a-44d5-9d35-c4b24a3fa592-2
00:37:15.958 --> 00:37:21.994
ocean. Meanwhile there's another
creature that is wearing that

e840a32d-673a-44d5-9d35-c4b24a3fa592-3
00:37:21.994 --> 00:37:23.240
looks like a.

ba2ab593-d218-4b44-87a7-a3a835922e6c-0
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.830
A fish with legs.

c15918fd-3a31-4574-9986-13d78e29849c-0
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.550
Looking out into the distance
and he sees on land.

071dd7d7-b742-4a70-ae36-d4f1050fd50c-0
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.800
I meant some of the trash that
are very visible from humans.

bc3d52f9-ef94-4275-b6e5-12549e704084-0
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.310
He sees the origami ship, sort
of half.

75f56e0c-b131-4273-be5a-4321cb0287c6-0
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.000
Underwater about to sink.

32b82f7f-1c74-4c23-baca-5f9bf4b3ae57-0
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:53.619
So as the origami ship is
sinking into the ocean and and

32b82f7f-1c74-4c23-baca-5f9bf4b3ae57-1
00:37:53.619 --> 00:38:01.402
and and kind of now immersed in
the sea water, it is being

32b82f7f-1c74-4c23-baca-5f9bf4b3ae57-2
00:38:01.402 --> 00:38:08.130
surrounded by jellyfish, a whole
sea of jellyfish.

ac212925-a65d-416b-9c5c-2bfe03b3c0d0-0
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.670
As well as one large jellyfish
that looks like.

877f880a-5c6d-46dc-a180-b55394d5cbed-0
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.020
A mixture of.

0cd0ba79-6745-47f5-a878-4bee7a14a6be-0
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.300
Jellyfish and coral.

00db5d6d-7844-4b04-8644-23cba228ee80-0
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.520
Very pretty though.

7d707dff-9d8f-44fd-a5bc-117f06954d7e-0
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:27.600
So.

42ef5178-50e4-4f29-9054-2962c9519409-0
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.290
The origami ship is actually now
being saved.

50e55f5a-fbd0-4e1a-94c2-8208494aae7b-0
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.640
By a group of.

193f86bc-3c40-4e22-a07d-e77456670334-0
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.553
As a school of fish that are
heading in one direction, using

193f86bc-3c40-4e22-a07d-e77456670334-1
00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:48.766
their eyes as a as a direction
to find the origami ship above

193f86bc-3c40-4e22-a07d-e77456670334-2
00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.370
water meanwhile.

1a18ae6a-66e2-4fdb-b9cc-9a00d7d46416-0
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.940
It looks as though.

f41c557c-6aa1-4613-85f6-05f27b36a37a-0
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.660
The ship is now the origami ship
is now quite deep.

c8055030-dc43-4623-be79-862a6bbdef04-0
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.664
Deep down in the ocean level
because all the it seems to be

c8055030-dc43-4623-be79-862a6bbdef04-1
00:39:04.664 --> 00:39:09.448
dark and it's following a an
octopus like creature or it's

c8055030-dc43-4623-be79-862a6bbdef04-2
00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:12.610
encountering an octopus like
creature.

32276de5-afa0-4e96-b3a8-ce92339b8311-0
00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.630
With some jellyfish surrounding.

77baa40e-fd8e-463d-99d5-13e8f49b9546-0
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.110
It's going to get to the bottom
of the ocean.

06c2d46a-d3fa-424e-ab21-687cae378d87-0
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.350
Where

ef4775ab-9800-4e77-ad1c-985a0970f672-0
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.430
Yes, the origami ship landed at
the bottom of the ocean and some

ef4775ab-9800-4e77-ad1c-985a0970f672-1
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.676
other creatures are are climbing
onto the origami ship, but

ef4775ab-9800-4e77-ad1c-985a0970f672-2
00:39:36.676 --> 00:39:39.790
meanwhile the origami ship is
being shined.

8abfba1c-af63-40b9-8471-83889a02335c-0
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.690
Through a ray of light that is
coming from.

89c890ce-3f77-4dab-974e-f3220fe558dd-0
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.800
It looks like.

ca93e5b2-6fce-45da-9a59-8ab533594d2b-0
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.960
A sunken ship.

ae930c38-a850-41f3-a1fa-80baebc20e1c-0
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:55.181
So the right side of the page
shows the origami ship at the

ae930c38-a850-41f3-a1fa-80baebc20e1c-1
00:39:55.181 --> 00:40:00.225
top at the tip of 1/2 sunken
submarine. Meanwhile, there's a

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:10.698
Creatures with tail lights that
are heading towards the subway

b6b233f6-9edf-4097-8d66-e372840b81ed-1
00:40:10.698 --> 00:40:17.232
submarine ship that is showing
light and the origami ship is

b6b233f6-9edf-4097-8d66-e372840b81ed-2
00:40:17.232 --> 00:40:19.909
also landed on top of it.

747a3e51-3f32-4acb-9eb0-c6e8ba011fee-0
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.970
The origami ship was actually
able to get to the.

cfc02e9b-7f5a-45d6-9008-b541d9327919-0
00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:35.660
The surface of the water, thanks
to this submarine that has been.

5c7b0bad-e465-4337-9dad-eea1dabff712-0
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:36.940

Able to get the origami ship
above water.

eafd43fc-9844-4389-8baf-ad7fc0565be7-0
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:51.432
The submarine ship is also
facing another ship that is half

eafd43fc-9844-4389-8baf-ad7fc0565be7-1
00:40:51.432 --> 00:40:52.830

People or people like creatures
that look as though they're

6e52e083-595f-425a-8b5f-d0a652c6fd7e-1
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.070
doing some fishing.

Umm.

39f1dfa9-4263-4d75-aaaa-5482baa6d051-0
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.550
Because there's some seagulls
flying around and the origami

39f1dfa9-4263-4d75-aaaa-5482baa6d051-1
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.580

Towards its destination again
above water.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.690
The origami ship is now being
played.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:49.310
As though they origami ship is
about to head towards another.

6f86fdf2-e0da-4b55-b663-f8468523dccf-0
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.670

So now that origami ship comes
through another area.

a3020242-12b4-4838-8d43-9d2f73be19da-0
00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.300

lighthouse.

ca4acec6-9168-4d3b-830b-9c40f953c1c0-0
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:59.739
The origami ship is now closer
to a large striped lighthouse

ca4acec6-9168-4d3b-830b-9c40f953c1c0-1
00:43:59.739 --> 00:44:05.826
and at the base of the
lighthouse there is a human like

ca4acec6-9168-4d3b-830b-9c40f953c1c0-2
00:44:05.826 --> 00:44:10.500
creature looking towards the
origami ship.

b3c4140c-6728-49d7-aa45-284b7d25f1c0-0
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:22.512
Now the there's a picture of the
origami ship sailing across the

b3c4140c-6728-49d7-aa45-284b7d25f1c0-1
00:44:22.512 --> 00:44:29.510
ocean, while in the close
distance there is a very tall

b3c4140c-6728-49d7-aa45-284b7d25f1c0-2
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.510
structure that is still.

26f6c1d6-4988-4491-bb8c-fde14bdb631f-0
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.170
Above sea level, but it is made.

98e99238-b4e2-4ca8-8ad3-0bbf75b225aa-0
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.980
About on on the sea.

c3b3f152-ca18-4b7b-94f3-1ccf89599bc5-0
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.600
It's a. It's a building that is.

a59a166d-b552-470a-b832-3e278d04b703-0
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.000
That looks like a pier.

032cf043-5554-457d-93fa-35f5cacfa7b9-0
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.360
And there is a large.

be4337c5-8132-42e8-b0c6-af64ae22a04d-0
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.504
Like ocean liner that sailing.
But this I think picture is

be4337c5-8132-42e8-b0c6-af64ae22a04d-1
00:44:56.504 --> 00:45:00.798
trying to show how large this
structure is compared to the

be4337c5-8132-42e8-b0c6-af64ae22a04d-2
00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:05.165
ocean line because the ocean
liner is relatively small, the

be4337c5-8132-42e8-b0c6-af64ae22a04d-3
00:45:05.165 --> 00:45:07.639
structure that looks like a
pier.

835c3347-9f11-4196-8f6a-73e1448230a7-0
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.810
Goes into the distance and there
are other boats.

eb50593d-ffda-44bf-bd93-6311e0ed9d75-0
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:16.120
That it shows how large it is.

9b400988-36c7-4ea2-aa1f-5314d95ec105-0
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.390
The origami ship now encounters
being close to the ship liner.

1b688103-908a-4e0c-abb3-d8fb78e5241c-0
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.968
Once again, it is. It is next to
a very, very large ocean liner.

1b688103-908a-4e0c-abb3-d8fb78e5241c-1
00:45:31.968 --> 00:45:35.520
And then there's another smaller
boat.

65516ba3-b931-4f62-bf4a-6e2d639ce513-0
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:42.245
That has a sailboat attached to
it that is also close by.

65516ba3-b931-4f62-bf4a-6e2d639ce513-1
00:45:42.245 --> 00:45:45.210
Meanwhile, there's a submarine.

50909123-0796-4acc-a24d-2ed4736319d6-0
00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.280
Ship.

63e944bc-1c11-4219-ba7d-d2e45575e3e2-0
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:48.740
That.

afd64816-eb47-4c29-9c0f-74b474161fd7-0
00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:54.739
Looks similar to the one that
rescued the origami ship and

afd64816-eb47-4c29-9c0f-74b474161fd7-1
00:45:54.739 --> 00:46:00.150
there is actually a city in the
distance that has chimneys.

ad3ad1f2-e034-41a3-8e62-a621931c5f2f-0
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.390
That looks to be where the ocean
liner is heading towards.

a8400b40-aa56-45ce-b137-96ecbc3ba0e8-0
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.930
Um, the.

b15dc752-c939-4fa0-94a1-cc06f0cd903c-0
00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:22.577
The left side of the page. I
can't really see where the

b15dc752-c939-4fa0-94a1-cc06f0cd903c-1
00:46:22.577 --> 00:46:27.992
origami ship is but it just
shows how large some of these

b15dc752-c939-4fa0-94a1-cc06f0cd903c-2
00:46:27.992 --> 00:46:30.980
structures are. The ocean liner.

a090269e-fc3a-4c93-b103-f6f576d211d4-0
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.870
Are huge.

b40fe197-ddaa-4880-8a6d-561a1739721f-0
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.200
But there's this one creature,
like um.

8d2b55a1-0910-46ee-b156-b72f0e4d051a-0
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:42.780
Boat like.

e47ab043-8638-4c39-ae76-9cac2b6a75ee-0
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:49.314
Structure that looks like a
killer whale that's taking a

e47ab043-8638-4c39-ae76-9cac2b6a75ee-1
00:46:49.314 --> 00:46:49.880
shower.

c4fd826e-6de0-492f-9f0c-d45e002f7104-0
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.130
Uh, and there are two, three
people on a very, very small

c4fd826e-6de0-492f-9f0c-d45e002f7104-1
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.910
rowboat swimming past.

980d34ae-bb03-40e6-a310-da31b92ab55e-0
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.836
Looking at this whale, killer
whale that's taking a shower and

980d34ae-bb03-40e6-a310-da31b92ab55e-1
00:47:04.836 --> 00:47:10.013
meanwhile the origami ship is
now very close to the edge of

980d34ae-bb03-40e6-a310-da31b92ab55e-2
00:47:10.013 --> 00:47:10.790
the pier.

9b9df9d1-e0c0-4065-9c99-8367cd961889-0
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.750
Almost.

7bfdabd4-c415-472d-b2e5-57902cea92e6-0
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:19.740
Watching as the rest of the
number of people.

8919f0d2-e1d3-458b-83bc-82b36ae2de57-0
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.930
Are greeting people who are
coming off the boat.

9f143d35-4f55-4ac9-833e-d169656f3665-0
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:33.194
There's a boat as well as two
large ship liners now. The

9f143d35-4f55-4ac9-833e-d169656f3665-1
00:47:33.194 --> 00:47:35.890
origami ship is close to.

e5d47845-9b91-410c-9337-edbb0fee9c3f-0
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.850
a pier close to a city.

4c37c29a-8b97-499a-9ff1-930a146a6058-0
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.870
In the background there is a
another factory like.

1ccee3f6-8780-4b8b-94a4-6c0e793c2651-0
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:53.321
Cranes and chimneys that show
that this is a a factory

1ccee3f6-8780-4b8b-94a4-6c0e793c2651-1
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:58.620
operating with people or people
like creatures.

a1befc16-540b-4316-9995-84ec6cdb0352-0
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:07.636
The origami ship is still in the
water and it's observing all

a1befc16-540b-4316-9995-84ec6cdb0352-1
00:48:07.636 --> 00:48:14.173
this and all these changes and
all these people who are close

a1befc16-540b-4316-9995-84ec6cdb0352-2
00:48:14.173 --> 00:48:20.709
by at the edge of the the pier
or near the factory is a crane

a1befc16-540b-4316-9995-84ec6cdb0352-3
00:48:20.709 --> 00:48:23.239
that is trying to raise.

43e0dcc9-90ff-47f0-8469-b0cf7b6d7ef8-0
00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.360
One of the submarines out of the
water.

6e4b2a5b-af53-4421-88c0-e9932d2a2a00-0
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.808
And there are some human like
creatures operating the crane

6e4b2a5b-af53-4421-88c0-e9932d2a2a00-1
00:48:33.808 --> 00:48:38.785
and doing some research, as well
as one person inside the

6e4b2a5b-af53-4421-88c0-e9932d2a2a00-2
00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:44.191
submarine who probably was the
captain or the navigator of the

6e4b2a5b-af53-4421-88c0-e9932d2a2a00-3
00:48:44.191 --> 00:48:49.597
submarine ship. The submarine
ship looks almost like a a large

6e4b2a5b-af53-4421-88c0-e9932d2a2a00-4
00:48:49.597 --> 00:48:50.369
seahorse.

7a4a9787-a110-469d-a8ff-c87cad14be56-0
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:59.513
Meanwhile, there's a boat that
the the origami ship has come

7a4a9787-a110-469d-a8ff-c87cad14be56-1
00:48:59.513 --> 00:49:00.060
across.

08c3186a-e334-4372-b71c-30f7a718391b-0
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.580
a boat is

22508eda-e876-407f-bd37-6d07f41ca514-0
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:11.214
There's a man on on top of the
boat, as well as a dog or a dog

22508eda-e876-407f-bd37-6d07f41ca514-1
00:49:11.214 --> 00:49:13.370
like creature and the.

fcee352a-daae-4bf5-81f7-bb449b632f2c-0
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:19.410
This boat seems to have been
able to capture.

245da0df-040e-4156-89a7-9ce6884d7846-0
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:24.700
The Unicorn like whale creature.

41c74eca-8dd8-4639-9e7b-cae15c6cfd25-0
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.325
As well as another creature,
very large creatures in its

41c74eca-8dd8-4639-9e7b-cae15c6cfd25-1
00:49:30.325 --> 00:49:35.425
caught in a net. So the two
creatures are caught in a large

41c74eca-8dd8-4639-9e7b-cae15c6cfd25-2
00:49:35.425 --> 00:49:40.780
net that is held up in a on a
crane and is above water and the

41c74eca-8dd8-4639-9e7b-cae15c6cfd25-3
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:45.965
origami ship is now closer to
the closest to the edge of the

41c74eca-8dd8-4639-9e7b-cae15c6cfd25-4
00:49:45.965 --> 00:49:46.390
town.

c1db5000-eb6c-4517-b332-f9cf6e087da6-0
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.390
Or the city.

5f47d411-57e9-474e-9dd2-0061a8143646-0
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:55.740
And there is a person that is
coming down the steps of the

5f47d411-57e9-474e-9dd2-0061a8143646-1
00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.300
pier or the edge of the harbor.

18eb3977-118c-4b8d-9881-636106412105-0
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:05.859
And coming down to the steps
very close to the surface of the

18eb3977-118c-4b8d-9881-636106412105-1
00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:11.540
ocean almost to see what he
could do with the origami ship.

85226abc-391c-4ba0-bf23-e7daccc9e91e-0
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.460
{Just uh huh.}

e1e11056-e4df-4cb6-9cef-1f1a0fb1818f-0
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.472
Meanwhile, the origami ship
seems to be going through a

e1e11056-e4df-4cb6-9cef-1f1a0fb1818f-1
00:50:19.472 --> 00:50:19.800
canal.

867b693f-0c10-4807-9a54-23af84ade70d-0
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.030
In between, that's running
through the city.

39378587-5660-4a6e-b58e-f0e47869f613-0
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:30.731
Once again, the whole image of
the city is very fantasy like

39378587-5660-4a6e-b58e-f0e47869f613-1
00:50:30.731 --> 00:50:35.670
that. Don't know whether it's
daytime or night time, but as

39378587-5660-4a6e-b58e-f0e47869f613-2
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:39.210
the origami ship sails through
this canal.

c51645fc-a74e-4204-ab8d-f66c720a93b4-0
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.093
And the water. There are
creatures that look like

c51645fc-a74e-4204-ab8d-f66c720a93b4-1
00:50:45.093 --> 00:50:50.702
pigeons. There's a another
reindeer that's on the top of a

c51645fc-a74e-4204-ab8d-f66c720a93b4-2
00:50:50.702 --> 00:50:56.407
building. There's another half
bat like half creature fish.

c51645fc-a74e-4204-ab8d-f66c720a93b4-3
00:50:56.407 --> 00:50:59.829
That's about two that has a a
fake.

ecfc636d-e876-4a99-810c-7556623076a3-0
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:07.583
Or a man-made propella that is
about to take off to fly from

ecfc636d-e876-4a99-810c-7556623076a3-1
00:51:07.583 --> 00:51:13.530
the roof of a chimney or roof of
a tall structure.

3f8bb9da-de9c-4b52-8497-3ec264f6fbc2-0
00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:21.510
Um, don't know if it's snowing
or if these are just lights that

3f8bb9da-de9c-4b52-8497-3ec264f6fbc2-1
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:27.350
are illuminating from the city,
but it is night time.

fa6cc551-726e-4b95-a56b-deb6ccf10c89-0
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:35.578
So the origami tree is now um
coming across other creatures

fa6cc551-726e-4b95-a56b-deb6ccf10c89-1
00:51:35.578 --> 00:51:40.100
that they seem to be friendly.
There's a clown like creature

fa6cc551-726e-4b95-a56b-deb6ccf10c89-2
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.140
that's saying hello to the
origami tree.

c9e79052-aa07-4458-9644-56fe41161168-0
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.094
There's a reindeer that's got a
backpack or that, just like

c9e79052-aa07-4458-9644-56fe41161168-1
00:51:49.094 --> 00:51:50.530
carrying a a pouch.

df383f34-5643-4d41-aedf-5088ac21e12b-0
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:58.351
There is another human like
creature that's wearing a oxygen

df383f34-5643-4d41-aedf-5088ac21e12b-1
00:51:58.351 --> 00:51:59.380
tank mask.

fe7eafb1-6ebd-4c56-8045-023448d51b88-0
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:05.412
There is one normal looking cat
at the top of the stairs that's

fe7eafb1-6ebd-4c56-8045-023448d51b88-1
00:52:05.412 --> 00:52:06.850
going towards the.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.890
In the city as the origami ship
continued to sail

53bf29ef-d787-49de-aa31-412930ac0bbd-0
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:16.340
Through the canal.

a141c60b-d38f-4042-ad1a-14f8a86f3e57-0
00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:24.670
There are some people also
underneath. Lamps. Lamps.

096f0a31-b62f-47fb-99ad-9400a1137b43-0
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:33.210
above water at the edge of the
canals they seem to be.

3b677dd5-2278-4a03-8c05-b9d6be205638-0
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:41.240
more human, like all of them
holding a round ball.

c676e8f1-3108-4b99-b4b9-44fd549daafa-0
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.660
 that seems to be illuminating.

4ef7920c-f3c2-488d-85e3-a62103ad384b-0
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:46.340
{All right.

18dea166-6b2e-439e-af05-e15085e4a83a-0
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:50.090
Second to last page.}

fedc47b9-1758-4802-93ee-25bd953b0df2-0
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.620
Meanwhile, the origami ship.

3715768e-a60a-4080-b42a-25807042d9fb-0
00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.750
Continues to sail through this
canal Lake area.

863d75f4-78f4-4cd2-a64b-f34bbafa074f-0
00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:08.187
It looks like it's night time
because the street lights are

863d75f4-78f4-4cd2-a64b-f34bbafa074f-1
00:53:08.187 --> 00:53:10.290
are on. Looks to be.

a2905bbe-ebca-4bb2-bcba-1ab67310d706-0
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:17.830
Heading towards a very small
house at the edge of the water.

ac70da62-ccdc-41d7-a766-1fa5886eed97-0
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:28.990
So that's the destination. As
the origami ship approaches the

ac70da62-ccdc-41d7-a766-1fa5886eed97-1
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:35.261
the House, the House door seems
to be opening. There's a faint

ac70da62-ccdc-41d7-a766-1fa5886eed97-2
00:53:35.261 --> 00:53:37.650
light that's coming out.

0c605833-2471-4fda-9716-23cb13583c58-0
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:44.165
Of the house that looks as
though somebody is actually

0c605833-2471-4fda-9716-23cb13583c58-1
00:53:44.165 --> 00:53:50.731
inside and has been waiting for
origami ship the origami ship

0c605833-2471-4fda-9716-23cb13583c58-2
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:56.980
now as it gets closer to the
edge of the water and towards

0c605833-2471-4fda-9716-23cb13583c58-3
00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.040
the house.

917007fd-1845-45e3-9f8d-a1d8a35422ae-0
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:04.157
A creature comes out of the
origami ship. 1 1 creature

917007fd-1845-45e3-9f8d-a1d8a35422ae-1
00:54:04.157 --> 00:54:05.940
that's dressed in.

0b0fea48-4466-4eb1-a829-df9269009f06-0
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.570
That has legs that seems to
have.

93f63ee0-2e75-47d7-8e9b-4cdbe74e9186-0
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:14.356
Um, the ability to go up and
down the stairs. There is

93f63ee0-2e75-47d7-8e9b-4cdbe74e9186-1
00:54:14.356 --> 00:54:18.640
somebody that's waiting for this
creature at the top of the

93f63ee0-2e75-47d7-8e9b-4cdbe74e9186-2
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.140
stairs.

6a940eeb-bd92-41b3-89a9-062597734f12-0
00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:24.446
The last picture shows two
people standing face to face

6a940eeb-bd92-41b3-89a9-062597734f12-1
00:54:24.446 --> 00:54:25.870
with just their legs.

81086509-5470-418e-9e59-9a2ad65811ad-0

{OK, so that was the story. Ohh,
that's the story. OK, so.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:39.672
Again, this next one is a
complex scene. Um, describe what

281525eb-1db8-4afd-936b-b15ad67a0853-1
00:54:39.672 --> 00:54:43.583
you see and what is happening,
and take between three and five

00:54:43.583 --> 00:54:45.260
minutes. Can you? Can you?}

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:50.392
{Sorry, I diminished your the
screen and so now I have to put

8fe51782-b8ed-484b-95d9-4888b821136a-1
00:54:50.392 --> 00:54:54.394
it because I can't really see.
Let me just give me yours. OK,

8fe51782-b8ed-484b-95d9-4888b821136a-2
00:54:54.394 --> 00:54:56.460
yeah, I'll stand. No, that's it.

530fa13b-6c80-433a-b157-1c9be4d64d8a-0
00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:02.150
I want it in full screen. That's
it. There. That's good. OK.

530fa13b-6c80-433a-b157-1c9be4d64d8a-1
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:03.360
Thank you. Good.}

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:09.270
#START_make_a_splash Um, so this
is a scene of

e01cb305-e28c-4aa1-87b3-fcd6ecae73c6-0
00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:17.470
A group of people having a good
time at a.

c3fe4510-b5e0-4b83-b7bc-0fdd5f1551b0-0
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:22.140
Either a pool.

a5d0a1fe-a2df-4e9d-b185-5a2fd8bb7c92-0
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:27.683
Or an ocean. Oh no, it's
probably a pool because there's

a5d0a1fe-a2df-4e9d-b185-5a2fd8bb7c92-1
00:55:27.683 --> 00:55:30.350
a lot of slides, there's a lot
of.

bfad6398-3b12-4b4c-846a-f12c4780d44b-0
00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:36.900
There's like 2-3 areas where
people could slide through to

bfad6398-3b12-4b4c-846a-f12c4780d44b-1
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.230
the bottom of the big pool.

77295318-b491-447c-a346-7ebf3c29f17f-0
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.510
There is also.

02b61fd9-109e-40d9-b98c-a928c0966d07-0
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:47.830
Um, an area where people can go
down a channel

30515a40-859f-48bd-95e2-7b16fd5341b5-0
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.390
Of the pool and a float.

a2bc41cb-f1f8-4d00-8c5f-14aed2fda535-0
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:56.320
That's shown in the left side,
lower left side of the page.

a16b8ee9-ebb7-4cee-ab59-e29fd44a95f8-0
00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:02.077
Everybody seems to be, um,
having a good time. It looks

a16b8ee9-ebb7-4cee-ab59-e29fd44a95f8-1
00:56:02.077 --> 00:56:05.760
like a mixture of parents as
well as children.

3c47d558-6536-4c59-a385-b4a6fa43692c-0
00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:07.730
Umm.

caf20159-8c23-492e-b8bf-860a472986da-0
00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:13.670
Looks like it's the summer time
most of the people.

24c700bf-1685-4169-9dd0-0825799372f5-0
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:19.688
Are either in the water or about
to jump into the water or

24c700bf-1685-4169-9dd0-0825799372f5-1
00:56:19.688 --> 00:56:24.024
sunbathing. There's a small
group of people who are

24c700bf-1685-4169-9dd0-0825799372f5-2
00:56:24.024 --> 00:56:29.359
sunbathing to them to buy the by
the canal, but everybody seems

24c700bf-1685-4169-9dd0-0825799372f5-3
00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:29.860
to be.

733d11c1-d35e-4843-a8e0-38b0e8ab37e9-0
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:33.860
Being active.

4dfadd07-5d79-4da6-85b9-3a4f85a228fe-0
00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:44.207
There's a, I mean a ship that is
also shaped in a way that has a

4dfadd07-5d79-4da6-85b9-3a4f85a228fe-1
00:56:44.207 --> 00:56:47.710
slide but also has a a dragon.

99bb6aad-845d-41e4-8e52-8085340da6d2-0
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:55.172
There are people at the top of
the ship are looking to either

99bb6aad-845d-41e4-8e52-8085340da6d2-1
00:56:55.172 --> 00:56:57.560
jump in or slide down or.

57543b13-ec8f-4ab9-87fd-3d2e7359cff6-0
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.520
Use the water cannons to spray.

b6082aec-5d44-4ceb-a18d-c2dc00ed9e1c-0
00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.030
There is another.

cf0d84e4-123d-47f7-b273-603cad1bb34d-0
00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:13.990
There's some lifeguards I see
that are going around trying to

cf0d84e4-123d-47f7-b273-603cad1bb34d-1
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:18.375
make sure things are safe.
They're they're wandering around

cf0d84e4-123d-47f7-b273-603cad1bb34d-2
00:57:18.375 --> 00:57:22.906
with a white T-shirt and orange
shorts, short shorts. There's

cf0d84e4-123d-47f7-b273-603cad1bb34d-3
00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:27.071
one, yeah, there's a couple of
lifeguards I see that are

cf0d84e4-123d-47f7-b273-603cad1bb34d-4
00:57:27.071 --> 00:57:29.409
carrying the lifeguard floaties.

6760d5c9-ded7-445b-9e5c-4c0a2bad5b36-0
00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:35.253
So it looks to be well
organized. Everybody seems to be

6760d5c9-ded7-445b-9e5c-4c0a2bad5b36-1
00:57:35.253 --> 00:57:36.680
having a good time.

1717bcf3-48c1-459c-a5f9-65b4da5c3845-0
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.060
From people who are.

b8a959a2-6580-443d-9df4-6b1af4cf5f24-0
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.270
Above water are not running.

2dd00622-d26e-45c2-890e-e976f8ec488e-0
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.920
Which is another safety feature.

b15a4016-c1f2-43f9-8290-dcf6c5eeca34-0
00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:54.421
Must be outside because there
are some people who are wearing

b15a4016-c1f2-43f9-8290-dcf6c5eeca34-1
00:57:54.421 --> 00:57:58.052
sunglasses, but for the most
part people are just wearing

b15a4016-c1f2-43f9-8290-dcf6c5eeca34-2
00:57:58.052 --> 00:58:01.370
bathing suits and just about to
jump into the water.

62224af9-ba35-4a3a-8e89-00527b03681a-0
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:13.253
There are some people who are
sliding down this tube of

62224af9-ba35-4a3a-8e89-00527b03681a-1
00:58:13.253 --> 00:58:17.352
slides. Some are going feet
first, some are going head

62224af9-ba35-4a3a-8e89-00527b03681a-2
00:58:17.352 --> 00:58:17.800
first.

0d50ef02-c728-4435-96d5-ed5fa6c60aff-0
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:23.811
#END_make_a_splash All seemed to
be having a good time and I

0d50ef02-c728-4435-96d5-ed5fa6c60aff-1
00:58:23.811 --> 00:58:27.820
don't see any unhappy faces. For
the most part, nobody crying.

c182db46-626d-4d1d-aac9-708963d67486-0
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:35.296
{OK, that was about four
minutes. We can go ahead. Um. So

c182db46-626d-4d1d-aac9-708963d67486-1
00:58:35.296 --> 00:58:40.655
the next one is a graphic novel,
which is about 20 pages. So

c182db46-626d-4d1d-aac9-708963d67486-2
00:58:40.655 --> 00:58:46.103
again, aiming for between 10 and
15 minutes to go through the

c182db46-626d-4d1d-aac9-708963d67486-3
00:58:46.103 --> 00:58:47.070
story, OK.}

822222ad-830c-4c81-8316-f166a80440a6-0
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:50.480
{OK.}

53b2f33f-9c4f-49ff-a000-0ff39623bbb8-0
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.280
#START_return So this is a
scene.

c50d12e8-8f6f-4b44-93a6-b49db0984b11-0
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:02.010
That shows um.

1462ef25-e4ba-40ce-b959-63552f7b6bdf-0
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.620
People who are in a house.

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:14.173
And there are two people that I
see so far. The house is

1bf17aa9-0f66-489b-acca-53067453f923-1
00:59:14.173 --> 00:59:15.410
actually in.

2b48030b-f01c-4bda-b11b-adf68c827297-0
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:22.628
Um, a part of a a town that has
a street light on. There's a

2b48030b-f01c-4bda-b11b-adf68c827297-1
00:59:22.628 --> 00:59:28.356
father or a an adult wearing
shorts at the top of the on the

2b48030b-f01c-4bda-b11b-adf68c827297-2
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:34.459
2nd floor above the entrance who
seems to be doing some artwork.

12fda3a0-b922-4d47-aa50-9639281c5687-0
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.682
House is cut up like a cake and
then you can see the inside and

12fda3a0-b922-4d47-aa50-9639281c5687-1
00:59:40.682 --> 00:59:43.390
what people are doing in the
inside.

fa85b3f5-8ebf-4198-9eca-46a0cee77cfc-0
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:49.180
Uh, there's a a boy that is in
his room.

c5e56639-a591-4ebd-bb15-b32bfc62165f-0
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:56.124
Um, and he seems to be carrying
a red ball. He has a orange

c5e56639-a591-4ebd-bb15-b32bfc62165f-1
00:59:56.124 --> 00:59:58.840
crown and he's using a red.

2e4cdd72-dda0-4002-9f09-ae0c03b2d8a3-0
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:06.293
Marker to draw on his wall.
There's a cat on the 2nd floor

2e4cdd72-dda0-4002-9f09-ae0c03b2d8a3-1
01:00:06.293 --> 01:00:12.798
that's resting on a sofa bench,
and other than that there are no

2e4cdd72-dda0-4002-9f09-ae0c03b2d8a3-2
01:00:12.798 --> 01:00:15.800
other activities taking place.

a396cc36-4493-48de-ac34-1fe088324874-0
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.770
Oh, and then there's a kite.

2a653850-312c-4d2b-a1a4-6335b0a86218-0
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.990
That seems to have flown into
the father's room.

08487778-78a2-4453-b709-40cab99c173b-0
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:33.940
So the kite now lands in the
fathers room. He stops his work.

44414457-ad20-43c8-b65e-3a6cba6eb3a7-0
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:40.213
That seems to be a drawing of
some kind. He picks up the kite

44414457-ad20-43c8-b65e-3a6cba6eb3a7-1
01:00:40.213 --> 01:00:45.770
that had landed at the foot of
his on the floor of his room. He

44414457-ad20-43c8-b65e-3a6cba6eb3a7-2
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:51.414
picks it up, and then he goes to
investigate where this kite has

44414457-ad20-43c8-b65e-3a6cba6eb3a7-3
01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:56.711
come from. He goes into his
son's room only to find out that

44414457-ad20-43c8-b65e-3a6cba6eb3a7-4
01:00:56.711 --> 01:01:01.573
the son is not there, and
instead the sun seems to have

44414457-ad20-43c8-b65e-3a6cba6eb3a7-5
01:01:01.573 --> 01:01:04.960
drawn on his wall with the red
marker.

39f61f11-70dd-4bb7-b758-baa8c5b588f2-0
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:11.750
An entrance to another a door
that has is a shape of a.

7c657690-25a5-44f6-b53a-d632b9a10e07-0
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:18.674
it colored in red. And it seems
to be heading into another

7c657690-25a5-44f6-b53a-d632b9a10e07-1
01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:24.185
direction, so the father is
looking into the door that's

7c657690-25a5-44f6-b53a-d632b9a10e07-2
01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:30.083
half open and trying to see if
his son has gone outside into

7c657690-25a5-44f6-b53a-d632b9a10e07-3
01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:31.630
and through the.

e442d6c8-ed94-49f4-ac2f-9381884fcac0-0
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.540
The next door.

16aa454b-8213-4a21-abad-8b98f2842a7d-0
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:43.791
All the then the father realizes
that he's the door leads him to

16aa454b-8213-4a21-abad-8b98f2842a7d-1
01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:50.637
a large forest, a forest that is
illuminated by lights of various

16aa454b-8213-4a21-abad-8b98f2842a7d-2
01:01:50.637 --> 01:01:51.260
kinds.

bb9cee12-0e30-463f-8936-113ad668531d-0
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:58.200
Almost like Christmas lights, as
well as Chinese lanterns that

bb9cee12-0e30-463f-8936-113ad668531d-1
01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.158
are hanging from the tree
branches. And at the base of A

bb9cee12-0e30-463f-8936-113ad668531d-2
01:02:03.158 --> 01:02:08.116
at there's a Creek that is
running in meandering through

bb9cee12-0e30-463f-8936-113ad668531d-3
01:02:08.116 --> 01:02:13.335
the trees. And at one area of
the Creek that has a man-made

bb9cee12-0e30-463f-8936-113ad668531d-4
01:02:13.335 --> 01:02:18.728
landing, there is a red ball.
The father notices the red ball

bb9cee12-0e30-463f-8936-113ad668531d-5
01:02:18.728 --> 01:02:21.860
as he examines the new
environment.

9283a116-c2b4-48f7-b0f3-3d7bec8e9397-0
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:31.028
He picks up the ball and he gets
to the edge of this landing and

9283a116-c2b4-48f7-b0f3-3d7bec8e9397-1
01:02:31.028 --> 01:02:36.806
then all of a sudden there is a
a boat, a wooden boat that is in

9283a116-c2b4-48f7-b0f3-3d7bec8e9397-2
01:02:36.806 --> 01:02:38.140
the shape of a.

3286f29c-18c3-411f-997c-8e455bd3eb18-0
01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.920
Hmm, kind of a.

cbc0d410-0f68-4b04-a153-2b8683f96428-0
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.990
Semi dragon.

8ffd035c-a6e1-4b1f-9db3-1cbd52c69a63-0
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.360
That is floating through the
canal and coming towards him.

aab2b8f4-084a-4e00-b617-05bcd78e9dfa-0
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:53.360
The canal.

4813c90a-6bb5-4f0b-963f-4ac20b30046d-0
01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.394
The the the ship, the boat that
is shaped like a horse with a

4813c90a-6bb5-4f0b-963f-4ac20b30046d-1
01:03:00.394 --> 01:03:00.810
tail.

3e980b64-0c8d-4ef0-9ed6-53c41cf29bb1-0
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:07.184
Lands very close to the the
father and the father jumps onto

3e980b64-0c8d-4ef0-9ed6-53c41cf29bb1-1
01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.240
the boat with the red ball.

c113d74d-529d-4c28-835d-a242e70260de-0
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:20.528
The father is heading towards a
fantasy city that has that is

c113d74d-529d-4c28-835d-a242e70260de-1
01:03:20.528 --> 01:03:25.490
entering the gates into a castle
like.

b6952350-8a21-4b7b-98b0-2af352a00e6c-0
01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.430
of a structure.

5422eee3-b6ad-422c-9f18-2309680c9ad8-0
01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:35.367
That is kind of like a has a
Moat and is about to enter and

5422eee3-b6ad-422c-9f18-2309680c9ad8-1
01:03:35.367 --> 01:03:40.242
in the distance, he actually
sees his son's way in the

5422eee3-b6ad-422c-9f18-2309680c9ad8-2
01:03:40.242 --> 01:03:41.040
distance.

ea8d6501-b9be-4964-be0a-f948985fbb43-0
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.650
Above the.

099ed1f4-9e5d-4263-9eac-3eab4612c554-0
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:50.471
Above the water and it looks as
though he's riding in some kind

099ed1f4-9e5d-4263-9eac-3eab4612c554-1
01:03:50.471 --> 01:03:54.939
of a red either scooter or it
looks like a boat, but it can't

099ed1f4-9e5d-4263-9eac-3eab4612c554-2
01:03:54.939 --> 01:03:59.551
be because it's above a bridge
and is heading away. I think the

099ed1f4-9e5d-4263-9eac-3eab4612c554-3
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.289
father seems to have spotted his
son.

9fe77ac8-e73d-40e0-acb1-af578cca9641-0
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.790
So the father? Oh, these are the
characters from the previous.

5880f9bb-a2f5-47be-94ef-942f3e133a09-0
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.860
the father lands

51b042cf-f37c-41af-876b-bc448912cd07-0
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.760
Looks as though he has been able
to.

901c2351-6222-488c-9463-d9e81dcae0c4-0
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:22.920
meet up with his son, who is
actually.

dbf8f3c8-1e6e-4353-a5dd-d056482c1699-0
01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.070
As was sailing on a red rowboat.

cc4157aa-37ff-4eb6-949e-ff9d7d3b6949-0
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.350
The father seemed to have left
the red ball in the.

c424baed-1435-4ad7-b2b6-9bc4fe08797f-0
01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:33.480
Ship.

dddb0bc2-d3f2-4f63-8b10-d2f366f0b143-0
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.510
The horseship that he was.

116793b2-3077-4735-a87f-563492b92a76-0
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.641
Sailing on and but he was too
excited to see his son, who's

116793b2-3077-4735-a87f-563492b92a76-1
01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:43.080
also with the girl.

264a4216-3259-4913-872b-45babe01905a-0
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:50.770
also holding a red marker and A
and an old man, that is.

f057ded5-8642-470d-930c-15c7e7daa3fa-0
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:54.690
Dressed like a shaman.

1227efbd-1b5b-47d6-9657-1b09983b3fa8-0
01:04:56.170 --> 01:05:00.628
there is a bird a purple bird
that's flying with them.

1227efbd-1b5b-47d6-9657-1b09983b3fa8-1
01:05:00.628 --> 01:05:05.410
Meanwhile they come across a
large chair that looks like a

1227efbd-1b5b-47d6-9657-1b09983b3fa8-2
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:06.870
king would sit on.

73d89102-a3c6-4a10-bb2f-d0c3eb08bc1e-0
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:17.876
So the father is now with his
son, who's holding a a purple

73d89102-a3c6-4a10-bb2f-d0c3eb08bc1e-1
01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:23.857
marker, a girl with a red
marker, and a old man they seem

73d89102-a3c6-4a10-bb2f-d0c3eb08bc1e-2
01:05:23.857 --> 01:05:25.919
to have encountered.

8f404de9-4045-4a30-9a79-c1b5e691adec-0
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:27.670
The ship.

57efe5ce-c94b-4f61-a2ec-2b7abfbb9c70-0
01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:34.322
The ship that the father was on
was being discovered by the

57efe5ce-c94b-4f61-a2ec-2b7abfbb9c70-1
01:05:34.322 --> 01:05:39.447
military group and so the
military now seems to run after

57efe5ce-c94b-4f61-a2ec-2b7abfbb9c70-2
01:05:39.447 --> 01:05:44.837
and so they are being chased by
the military. The old man is

57efe5ce-c94b-4f61-a2ec-2b7abfbb9c70-3
01:05:44.837 --> 01:05:49.874
holding a an orange marker and
is trying to distract the

57efe5ce-c94b-4f61-a2ec-2b7abfbb9c70-4
01:05:49.874 --> 01:05:50.670
military.

11f8c13c-be30-45ba-94d5-2c85d3d5a0e6-0
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:56.660
Who's chasing towards the the
father and the two children.

61c84834-0495-49b0-bcf8-4d802802a93b-0
01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:06.458
So the old man is trying to use
the orange marker as a weapon,

61c84834-0495-49b0-bcf8-4d802802a93b-1
01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:11.191
and it becomes a a sword. He
draws a sword, an orange sword.

61c84834-0495-49b0-bcf8-4d802802a93b-2
01:06:11.191 --> 01:06:15.692
It becomes something that he can
use to fight against the

61c84834-0495-49b0-bcf8-4d802802a93b-3
01:06:15.692 --> 01:06:19.650
military man, but the military
man has a stronger.

dce7d065-0c7f-41bf-9284-4d96e29d6a12-0
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.650
Uh.

01e7b67c-0f50-4ce9-b710-5b1b47f592b8-0
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.424
tool that seems to erase the
sword and back into a crayon.

01e7b67c-0f50-4ce9-b710-5b1b47f592b8-1
01:06:27.424 --> 01:06:32.747
And so all of a sudden the old
man is without a way to defend

01e7b67c-0f50-4ce9-b710-5b1b47f592b8-2
01:06:32.747 --> 01:06:38.155
himself, and so he's captured by
the military and the man with

01e7b67c-0f50-4ce9-b710-5b1b47f592b8-3
01:06:38.155 --> 01:06:43.477
the tool to erase is now running
after the father and the two

01e7b67c-0f50-4ce9-b710-5b1b47f592b8-4
01:06:43.477 --> 01:06:44.249
children.

39a2f3ea-53e9-4723-adae-34f9c8af02ae-0
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:49.960
And the boy is using his purple
marker.

a7b9c55d-3237-472d-99d6-d006a5a6380a-0
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:57.063
To draw what looks like a flying
horse and the father and the two

a7b9c55d-3237-472d-99d6-d006a5a6380a-1
01:06:57.063 --> 01:07:02.550
children ride on the draw the
Purple 4 horse that flies.

3ea7d0fe-8066-4457-8acc-cff1081cd21b-0
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.970
Into the distance, just barely
escaping the military man.

c4c412c6-f2df-4c26-8aa2-820bb6e3c5e3-0
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:14.160
Ohh but the.

e9b92dad-4ad3-4958-837b-9045cf71dd84-0
01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:21.884
Man that has the equipment seems
to use his eraser, and the

e9b92dad-4ad3-4958-837b-9045cf71dd84-1
01:07:21.884 --> 01:07:27.809
purple marker that was in the
boy's hand is actually being

e9b92dad-4ad3-4958-837b-9045cf71dd84-2
01:07:27.809 --> 01:07:33.733
retracted by the man with the
eraser. Meanwhile, he's also

e9b92dad-4ad3-4958-837b-9045cf71dd84-3
01:07:33.733 --> 01:07:40.160
erasing the the drawing of the
the Purple Flying Horse that the

e9b92dad-4ad3-4958-837b-9045cf71dd84-4
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.570
two are using to escape.

6a19e6f6-8196-4249-b810-fd876a527dc4-0
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.280
So as a result.

54159add-7ac1-4752-9f8d-b5f8de57cce1-0
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:49.730
The man is continuing to use the
eraser.

1c3f705e-4420-4e36-be81-ff312f748725-0
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.180
Um, and the eraser is now.

b1590033-d456-455c-adef-65dbd15568c0-0
01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:00.234
Has changed the image of the
Flying horse to feathers, purple

b1590033-d456-455c-adef-65dbd15568c0-1
01:08:00.234 --> 01:08:05.167
feathers. Meanwhile, the three
people that were on the horse

b1590033-d456-455c-adef-65dbd15568c0-2
01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:08.160
Flying Horse is floating in the
sky.

91ec7bb9-9271-4ea0-9809-b92f7af583ef-0
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:14.117
The little boy is actually being
saved by the old man who

91ec7bb9-9271-4ea0-9809-b92f7af583ef-1
01:08:14.117 --> 01:08:16.800
captures holds his hand as he.

821f2e02-9b86-45ed-ae28-8d58073d8287-0
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:20.610
Stops himself from flying off.

d4c2b0ba-b24c-4e6c-972e-4c44c9bc0d88-0
01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.080
But the father and the girl are
actually continuing to.

5475aaf6-f9c0-4b86-94ea-c7a00c0beb42-0
01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:34.530
Fall down into Earth as the
they're no longer in the.

0e9acd35-0858-431f-ac73-3bb733f34f4a-0
01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.300
And on a on a flying horse they
land into the ocean.

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-0
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:44.611
The ocean and they and there's a
picture of them in the in the

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-1
01:08:44.611 --> 01:08:49.235
middle of the ocean. The girl is
quick to be able to use her red

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-2
01:08:49.235 --> 01:08:53.433
pen marker to draw something
that will save them and looks

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-3
01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:57.986
like a submarine. Meanwhile, the
bird, the purple bird, is with

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-4
01:08:57.986 --> 01:09:02.325
them. So she's been able to
successfully draw a submarine, a

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-5
01:09:02.325 --> 01:09:06.522
large submarine that the father
and the girl can head back

fdd8cab2-18d7-4d91-84f6-90fb1a73abc3-6
01:09:06.522 --> 01:09:10.080
towards the island so that they
can save the boy.

313b2364-dd12-431e-bc61-fa01f417c9e4-0
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:19.102
So the red submarine lands in a
cave like structure is above

313b2364-dd12-431e-bc61-fa01f417c9e4-1
01:09:19.102 --> 01:09:19.720
water.

f144e89b-18b2-4ee9-9ed7-6b39ffe70ce0-0
01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:24.930
And they're still trying to find
the boy.

1c89e840-f23f-4d9f-a44e-b8c2eee883f8-0
01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:30.349
That's being captured by the
military as well as the old man.

1c89e840-f23f-4d9f-a44e-b8c2eee883f8-1
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:34.911
They get into a cave that seems
to have drawings that may help

1c89e840-f23f-4d9f-a44e-b8c2eee883f8-2
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:36.070
them find a way.

e6ef1ca3-24b8-4624-9aec-f536d1ab2108-0
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:42.760
To get to the boy, it looks like
there are images.

0abdc335-9c74-44db-989f-ee2e24ac2905-0
01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:47.700
Of the story that seems to have
happened.

0348eb62-541f-4f20-95fe-0b5a3e068b7c-0
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:51.340
And they're trying to.

7610cfef-dbec-48f4-aa64-bb5a835105b6-0
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.204
The boy the father and the girl
is trying to look at the ceiling

7610cfef-dbec-48f4-aa64-bb5a835105b6-1
01:09:52.204 --> 01:09:52.730
that has all the descriptions of
the event

1ad18880-07fe-423e-9614-5a1fcc499099-0
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:59.342
The bird is looking outside
because the bird sees a shadow

1ad18880-07fe-423e-9614-5a1fcc499099-1
01:09:59.342 --> 01:10:03.952
of a creature approaching, but
the girl and the man are too

1ad18880-07fe-423e-9614-5a1fcc499099-2
01:10:03.952 --> 01:10:06.180
busy looking at the pictures.

cb441e26-4ef8-40df-9131-0cfe182685fa-0
01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:12.500
It's that they are at an edge of
a cave and so.

1f4de3c8-4399-4297-a41d-b958f97ec92a-0
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:19.980
The creature approaching them is
shown as a shadow.

ed6accdd-90e6-4434-904f-d40b2ae116f8-0
01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.604
Meanwhile, they're able to find
the man that has the eraser and

ed6accdd-90e6-4434-904f-d40b2ae116f8-1
01:10:29.604 --> 01:10:34.954
the boat that they use to
capture the old man. There is no

ed6accdd-90e6-4434-904f-d40b2ae116f8-2
01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:38.310
picture of there is no image of
boy.

8938a479-41f6-4cc5-a3ec-7de7241fee3f-0
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.077
But meanwhile the father, who I
think was an illustrator because

8938a479-41f6-4cc5-a3ec-7de7241fee3f-1
01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:44.930
of his job.

c69a5b87-2356-4858-b3ed-0adc2ea38184-0
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:52.955
Now is drawing using another
marker to try to see if he can.

c69a5b87-2356-4858-b3ed-0adc2ea38184-1
01:10:52.955 --> 01:10:57.240
He's using the illustration on
The Cave.

ff7777d1-b3a1-4b3a-8c32-c1c9fa4f3e4e-0
01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:04.902
To try to see how he could
rescue his son and he's drawing

ff7777d1-b3a1-4b3a-8c32-c1c9fa4f3e4e-1
01:11:04.902 --> 01:11:05.730
a cage.

f9c094a4-e715-4b87-852e-5e25783d4be4-0
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.060
For the bird.

bdb7e34d-40cd-4547-a463-ad24d8a33036-0
01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:16.461
So they're using the bird to
entice the military man with the

bdb7e34d-40cd-4547-a463-ad24d8a33036-1
01:11:16.461 --> 01:11:21.871
eraser. Meanwhile, it's actually
like a capture. It's like a trap

bdb7e34d-40cd-4547-a463-ad24d8a33036-2
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:25.970
once the man the military man
trap tries to trap.

34f2e90e-565c-4923-b68f-a7a0288a240d-0
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:32.104
The bird that's on this
structure, he as he lands, the

34f2e90e-565c-4923-b68f-a7a0288a240d-1
01:11:32.104 --> 01:11:38.359
structure closes and he himself
is being captured in a birdlike

34f2e90e-565c-4923-b68f-a7a0288a240d-2
01:11:38.359 --> 01:11:44.711
cage. Meanwhile, his eraser has
left his hand and now the father

34f2e90e-565c-4923-b68f-a7a0288a240d-3
01:11:44.711 --> 01:11:47.350
has the eraser in his hand.

48c50b9c-de53-4729-9595-22f3e8e1c800-0
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:54.580
So all of a sudden.

c7e442ef-1b40-46ba-a13e-68caf6297721-0
01:11:56.350 --> 01:12:04.002
The the father is has broken the
the eraser and the eraser is now

c7e442ef-1b40-46ba-a13e-68caf6297721-1
01:12:04.002 --> 01:12:10.959
releasing all the things that
has it has trapped inside the

c7e442ef-1b40-46ba-a13e-68caf6297721-2
01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:17.684
box including the horse like
purple flying the the flying

c7e442ef-1b40-46ba-a13e-68caf6297721-3
01:12:17.684 --> 01:12:18.380
horse.

68048888-54fc-4c42-bfcc-0e83bf894f6f-0
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:24.585
As well as other flying
butterflies and Dragons.

68048888-54fc-4c42-bfcc-0e83bf894f6f-1
01:12:24.585 --> 01:12:30.260
Dragonflies. Meanwhile the sun
and the old man is walking

68048888-54fc-4c42-bfcc-0e83bf894f6f-2
01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:36.230
towards the father. That's just
that, just broke the eraser.

2e453335-7f5c-4874-b7de-f916afc9851a-0
01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:42.340
So it wasn't really an eraser,
it was just a.

7d9a55da-9137-4174-b978-aa40be4d01dd-0
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.670
It was a absorber of images.

149f2d62-394b-4f86-a7bf-794fdc7a0fec-0
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.357
Drawn drawn from the crayons,
there's a picture of the

149f2d62-394b-4f86-a7bf-794fdc7a0fec-1
01:12:55.357 --> 01:13:00.939
military people heading back
away from them, as well as the

149f2d62-394b-4f86-a7bf-794fdc7a0fec-2
01:13:00.939 --> 01:13:06.522
captured military men, with the
eraser being carried by the

149f2d62-394b-4f86-a7bf-794fdc7a0fec-3
01:13:06.522 --> 01:13:12.011
purple Flying Horse into the
distance. The father, the two

149f2d62-394b-4f86-a7bf-794fdc7a0fec-4
01:13:12.011 --> 01:13:18.059
children and the old man are are
watching them fly, fly away and

149f2d62-394b-4f86-a7bf-794fdc7a0fec-5
01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:18.990
swim away.

f6cc84b2-c26e-4818-a356-42bdca21cb94-0
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:26.280
The girl is very appreciative of
the father or helping them.

2b726623-49cd-4663-b669-6aaed2afe826-0
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:30.580
And so she is giving him a hug.

a970ed7f-9be1-4986-b58d-d1a52fb8d31b-0
01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:38.708
Meanwhile, there's a small door
at the base of a rock that has

a970ed7f-9be1-4986-b58d-d1a52fb8d31b-1
01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:45.329
that shows some entrance with
the kite that was in the in the

a970ed7f-9be1-4986-b58d-d1a52fb8d31b-2
01:13:45.329 --> 01:13:45.970
house.

cc7b1cbd-c866-41e4-ab46-e239583f1264-0
01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:49.990
That the father picked up so the
kite.

708c383d-5e42-46ec-8a30-92132226e065-0
01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.520
Is actually leading him back
into.

edb68f09-05c1-4cdb-9408-887205ae9bee-0
01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:01.230
His work room that he was in and
the kite is actually now being.

6f29760b-f2bd-4d00-8c1c-51166d852d78-0
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:08.568
#END_return Flown in the sky in
this, that the city or the town

6f29760b-f2bd-4d00-8c1c-51166d852d78-1
01:14:08.568 --> 01:14:11.570
that the boy and the father
live.

3d480af6-cd50-48d3-a031-e97687084975-0
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.330
{So that was the story. Ohh that
was a story, OK.

8367feed-b449-4ef3-9ed6-99364c7f268d-0
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.340
So going ahead, we have a
complex scene.}

b1257c4b-70bd-4949-85dd-251e85321a1a-0
01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.190
#START_escape_from_the_zoo So
this is a another.

28503f38-1da6-464a-ba52-edbfa858e424-0
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.130
Looks like it takes place in a
zoo.

10f13c55-364e-4d61-856a-3c0efb7f8649-0
01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:34.190
Um.

5d696bd3-d54c-47ec-b885-827c795f8c2c-0
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:42.758
There are a number of animals
that seems to be happy to be

5d696bd3-d54c-47ec-b885-827c795f8c2c-1
01:14:42.758 --> 01:14:46.200
observed by the humans people.

8f2d1a4c-bb32-497c-9bc1-77c8179e07b9-0
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:50.700
Um, except a gorilla that
doesn't look very happy.

4d907772-925c-4a66-9e4a-8f161ce09c89-0
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:56.010
But for the most part, there's a
rhinoceros.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:05.020
That is, in the midst of it
seems to have escaped his.

971e20c1-afc8-4aec-b9f4-a0376f5b93e7-0
01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:10.030
Is cave, his cage.

0b4e7c1e-19f2-413d-b58e-7dacd4e5e3f5-0
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:15.435
There's a lion that looks as
though he's ready to eat one of

0b4e7c1e-19f2-413d-b58e-7dacd4e5e3f5-1
01:15:15.435 --> 01:15:16.150
the humans.

2b558748-a001-48a5-908e-8ad53c4e807a-0
01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.714
He's looking at them from a
distance with a tongue saying

2b558748-a001-48a5-908e-8ad53c4e807a-1
01:15:20.714 --> 01:15:21.510
I'm I'm hungry.

ceda8b49-9425-47a5-87c3-3d157f5423f7-0
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.242
So there's a Peacock that people
that people like to take

ceda8b49-9425-47a5-87c3-3d157f5423f7-1
01:15:27.242 --> 01:15:31.569
pictures of, and there's a
Penguin hidden in the Peacock

ceda8b49-9425-47a5-87c3-3d157f5423f7-2
01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.240
swing. There are some.

211219f7-77a6-48ec-9137-c0a38b015899-0
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:36.600
Pink flamingos.

176a1790-cc6a-481c-ad26-1c3a0a602350-0
01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:44.586
Uh, that are with the rhinoceros
that's in the water. There is

176a1790-cc6a-481c-ad26-1c3a0a602350-1
01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:46.310
some zebras that

55300042-d682-470f-a1ce-f6516658ce64-0
01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:53.280
Looked confused as the people
looked at him.

96c8acec-62cf-4ad0-bf2f-c5a4064182b1-0
01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.210
There's actually 2 zebras.
There's some animals on the tree

96c8acec-62cf-4ad0-bf2f-c5a4064182b1-1
01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:05.982
branch. They look like some kind
of a wrecking with long tails.

96c8acec-62cf-4ad0-bf2f-c5a4064182b1-2
01:16:05.982 --> 01:16:11.934
There's a polar bear site in the
background. The polar bear seems

96c8acec-62cf-4ad0-bf2f-c5a4064182b1-3
01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:17.525
to be happy being watched by the
humans. There's another area

96c8acec-62cf-4ad0-bf2f-c5a4064182b1-4
01:16:17.525 --> 01:16:22.665
where the elephants trying to
take away a boy's peanuts,

96c8acec-62cf-4ad0-bf2f-c5a4064182b1-5
01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:25.010
slurping it with his nose.

aeec852d-220a-4bd3-90e7-e1cfdfa43b27-0
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:32.043
So yeah, I see now where the
rhinoceros came from. His way at

aeec852d-220a-4bd3-90e7-e1cfdfa43b27-1
01:16:32.043 --> 01:16:34.920
the back of the zoo. So he must
have.

8e05305d-a059-4533-9409-5b5ce9512206-0
01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:39.296
Kind of strung through the
middle of the zoo and people

8e05305d-a059-4533-9409-5b5ce9512206-1
01:16:39.296 --> 01:16:39.610
were.

cf9227b1-51f7-48ea-85b3-f14f25f30d51-0
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:46.543
Um, alarmed and a little
frightened of this rhinoceros.

cf9227b1-51f7-48ea-85b3-f14f25f30d51-1
01:16:46.543 --> 01:16:52.343
Meanwhile, there's actually
another area it looks as though

cf9227b1-51f7-48ea-85b3-f14f25f30d51-2
01:16:52.343 --> 01:16:54.470
the Penguins might be.

36cab043-ca89-4278-a1e5-70cc90ff73ea-0
01:16:55.130 --> 01:17:00.173
Because there's an eagle like
structures but we don't see

36cab043-ca89-4278-a1e5-70cc90ff73ea-1
01:17:00.173 --> 01:17:05.304
anybody in it. Because the
Penguin it seems like is hidden

36cab043-ca89-4278-a1e5-70cc90ff73ea-2
01:17:05.304 --> 01:17:10.348
in the Peacocks wings and
there's an ice cream stand next

36cab043-ca89-4278-a1e5-70cc90ff73ea-3
01:17:10.348 --> 01:17:14.869
to the Penguins cage. The man is
selling ice cream.

4fc6fd4f-1baa-4212-9e4c-20c718c0cf7d-0
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.175
There's a a monkey that's
pretending to read a newspaper

4fc6fd4f-1baa-4212-9e4c-20c718c0cf7d-1
01:17:22.175 --> 01:17:23.370
on the bench.

f7f25b87-7192-403a-be4c-31b1ecb8bc02-0
01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:31.200
So he's being discrete. There's
a boy that's trying to feed the

f7f25b87-7192-403a-be4c-31b1ecb8bc02-1
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.690
antler and popcorn even though
he's not supposed to.

a3d9ffb2-1275-4ebd-95ca-3b715682a96a-0
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:43.164
Um, there's two giraffes, no 3
giraffes and an area with other

a3d9ffb2-1275-4ebd-95ca-3b715682a96a-1
01:17:43.164 --> 01:17:44.360
antlers and.

4aab6b25-cb58-40a6-8a77-f1c02b83287c-0
01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:49.228
Oh, I see another Penguin.
There's another Penguin that

4aab6b25-cb58-40a6-8a77-f1c02b83287c-1
01:17:49.228 --> 01:17:50.080
seems to have.

c1fe75da-414b-485c-ae21-85cb9c9e1e46-0
01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:55.373
Pretending that he's just
reading a newspaper, I see

c1fe75da-414b-485c-ae21-85cb9c9e1e46-1
01:17:55.373 --> 01:18:00.177
another Penguin that is trying
to hold on to the rhinoceros

c1fe75da-414b-485c-ae21-85cb9c9e1e46-2
01:18:00.177 --> 01:18:02.740
that's storming through the zoo.

8f60633b-4e43-4146-b046-f078642757c4-0
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:10.012
And there's another Penguin
amidst a group of people as he's

8f60633b-4e43-4146-b046-f078642757c4-1
01:18:10.012 --> 01:18:12.400
doing a dance with a top hat.

596740de-f291-4e9e-a5a6-3f8ab0e56819-0
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.380
And um.

40099f1e-3c12-471d-b245-ba759ae17aa3-0
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:21.380
And there's a people at the back
going in and out of a cafe.

09155a75-cc52-4fb8-8c88-834feb902820-0
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.318
There's some. There's another
Penguin that tried to hide and

09155a75-cc52-4fb8-8c88-834feb902820-1
01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:31.598
behind a man who's standing to
get an ice cream and he's trying

09155a75-cc52-4fb8-8c88-834feb902820-2
01:18:31.598 --> 01:18:35.877
to get an he's trying to give an
he's trying to exchange an ice

09155a75-cc52-4fb8-8c88-834feb902820-3
01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.750
cream for a soda with a man.

003b665c-b80f-4633-9896-09fb73ed8efe-0
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:41.970
Um and.

22bb56d1-7170-460f-82fb-3ca8db215499-0
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:47.659
Meanwhile, there's a there's a
group of people who are dressed

22bb56d1-7170-460f-82fb-3ca8db215499-1
01:18:47.659 --> 01:18:51.127
like safari, people who are
trying to capture the

22bb56d1-7170-460f-82fb-3ca8db215499-2
01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:55.011
rhinoceros, who's storming
through. He has a very small

22bb56d1-7170-460f-82fb-3ca8db215499-3
01:18:55.011 --> 01:18:59.520
neck, so don't think he's going
to be successful, but they have.

22bb56d1-7170-460f-82fb-3ca8db215499-4
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.739
They're there to try to capture.

5cce8970-62e5-410c-bac7-7d75a13f008d-0
01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.788
The rhinoceros. Meanwhile, I
guess the people who are dressed

5cce8970-62e5-410c-bac7-7d75a13f008d-1
01:19:06.788 --> 01:19:09.890
like safari people are maybe the
workers of the zoo.

ff8ee497-7dac-4c88-b261-062f3ecb5001-0
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:15.662
Because there's another man
closer to the monkey age that is

ff8ee497-7dac-4c88-b261-062f3ecb5001-1
01:19:15.662 --> 01:19:19.410
reprimanding a boy that's making
fun of the animals.

9c2bb863-7976-4bed-9ce4-934a7bb03668-0
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:25.616
And there is a man that's
actually standing behind the boy

9c2bb863-7976-4bed-9ce4-934a7bb03668-1
01:19:25.616 --> 01:19:29.407
that's giving popcorn to the
antlers, probably about to say

9c2bb863-7976-4bed-9ce4-934a7bb03668-2
01:19:29.407 --> 01:19:30.859
don't feed the animals.

86114250-9069-4cf4-942e-3fd135fa404a-0
01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:36.639
There's also a kangaroo that
seems to be bouncing trying to

86114250-9069-4cf4-942e-3fd135fa404a-1
01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:38.360
get food from somebody.

16efd7c3-8e06-4f38-aead-67a2f4a6fda9-0
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:40.170
From.

e7efc75a-2cc5-4e89-9cf5-f8ff6b1e83cc-0
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:46.600
And oh, I guess because the
rhinoceros has broken the fence.

861683bd-e82a-4e71-a813-03831629953c-0
01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:52.831
Escape way at the back there's a
rhinoceros cage that where the

861683bd-e82a-4e71-a813-03831629953c-1
01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:57.525
the cage is broken and so there
seems to be people who have gone

861683bd-e82a-4e71-a813-03831629953c-2
01:19:57.525 --> 01:20:01.785
into the rhinoceros cage and so
there's a zoo, zoo helper,

861683bd-e82a-4e71-a813-03831629953c-3
01:20:01.785 --> 01:20:06.334
zookeeper or zoo person that's
trying to tell them don't don't

861683bd-e82a-4e71-a813-03831629953c-4
01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.140
encounter the rhinoceros.

onto an airplane and go

Cargo and luggage, meanwhile,
there's also a scene that's in

where they're trying to claim

that is being driven by a card

c72ab197-1891-4583-b128-50349909d49e-1
01:21:59.178 --> 01:22:01.210
ace of spade.

e77d8aea-c6f5-44c6-b89b-47cdb173d9c1-0
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.320
Maybe he came from another
story.

b545e9f2-8ac9-4f48-b1d3-3ce69255c845-0
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:10.053
There's a fire truck that's
coming towards and spraying

b545e9f2-8ac9-4f48-b1d3-3ce69255c845-1
01:22:10.053 --> 01:22:12.090
people instead of spraying.

e8ac7e48-566d-46d2-b786-d83976500920-0
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:16.804
Or trying to tear down the water
because they think that the

e8ac7e48-566d-46d2-b786-d83976500920-1
01:22:16.804 --> 01:22:20.964
smoke is actually coming from an
airplane, but it's just a group

e8ac7e48-566d-46d2-b786-d83976500920-2
01:22:20.964 --> 01:22:24.868
of people who are hidden behind
cargo smoking and so they've

e8ac7e48-566d-46d2-b786-d83976500920-3
01:22:24.868 --> 01:22:25.700
been alarmed.

1713cc96-fb2f-4411-b9cb-80bbd8e9af05-0
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:30.601
For the smoke, but they haven't
been able to identify where the

1713cc96-fb2f-4411-b9cb-80bbd8e9af05-1
01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:31.990
smoke is coming from.

e42f6942-7198-4b43-b41f-5b148421a5ad-0
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:33.790
Of.

8383651a-d5dd-4e87-8b2c-5cc65c764fd8-0
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:40.850
There's some. There's an
airplane that has disembarked.

fc9559f9-f6ec-42a0-9c48-a8da55c076b0-0
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:45.920
Passengers and passengers are
coming into the terminal.

8768d37a-605c-4257-beb9-1ccf117700c1-0
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:51.126
Um, there's a group of people
who are trying to unload the

8768d37a-605c-4257-beb9-1ccf117700c1-1
01:22:51.126 --> 01:22:54.885
luggage and they're trying to
throw the luggage, and if you

8768d37a-605c-4257-beb9-1ccf117700c1-2
01:22:54.885 --> 01:22:58.519
get the rhythm right, you can
capture them. But yeah, the

8768d37a-605c-4257-beb9-1ccf117700c1-3
01:22:58.519 --> 01:23:02.278
rhythm isn't correct because one
person is being hit by the

8768d37a-605c-4257-beb9-1ccf117700c1-4
01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:06.037
luggage. There's some people on
top of the landed airplane,

8768d37a-605c-4257-beb9-1ccf117700c1-5
01:23:06.037 --> 01:23:07.289
which seems unusual.

411ca355-c88c-4a84-838f-3325672d51fe-0
01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.165
So there's a, there's some
activity, but not at all good,

411ca355-c88c-4a84-838f-3325672d51fe-1
01:23:14.165 --> 01:23:17.995
not all good. At the back,
there's an airplane that's just

411ca355-c88c-4a84-838f-3325672d51fe-2
01:23:17.995 --> 01:23:18.580
about to.

1be0dd4a-9522-4f05-8536-b8fd61528fa4-0
01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:24.929
Take some air, air elephants
onto the airplane. 12344

1be0dd4a-9522-4f05-8536-b8fd61528fa4-1
01:23:24.929 --> 01:23:29.230
elephants, four elephants
probably equal like a.

83b01765-feed-4201-939b-9fc694dc6b7d-0
01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:34.380
Cargo full of something full of
people way in the back.

88096d0f-0103-4247-9cf3-3d99add86101-0
01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:39.606
There are some flying objects
including a normal airplanes as

88096d0f-0103-4247-9cf3-3d99add86101-1
01:23:39.606 --> 01:23:42.720
well as rockets as well as the
spaceship.

f756ce72-e85e-4352-850c-89bcfbc6bee3-0
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.570
An old style air assessments.

6c07f27d-0d88-4288-aae3-51bf84798a47-0
01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:53.150
And a balloon. I think they're
called balloons.

2648f50e-b061-48e1-854f-bcbe72146802-0
01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:58.720
There's a helicopter that seems
to have.

cfde4fa1-dd3c-454f-893f-94cb58c49991-0
01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:05.557
Maybe sending off maybe a
somebody who is from another

cfde4fa1-dd3c-454f-893f-94cb58c49991-1
01:24:05.557 --> 01:24:11.659
country because there are some
flags that are flown around it,

cfde4fa1-dd3c-454f-893f-94cb58c49991-2
01:24:11.659 --> 01:24:13.500
maybe a delegation.

c2147f9c-ec92-4cf0-bddb-382bf63b5b08-0
01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:22.080
There's so there's a mismatch of
things it got. It just goes to

c2147f9c-ec92-4cf0-bddb-382bf63b5b08-1
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:22.580
show.

4e44bc92-bca6-4bc3-939a-11f4adf80e4d-0
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.509
The chaos of an airport,
airport. Not all of them good

4e44bc92-bca6-4bc3-939a-11f4adf80e4d-1
01:24:27.509 --> 01:24:29.770
because people are falling off.

887d80e3-4189-4cdf-b057-bd9ed3a4bc12-0
01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:36.762
Airplanes where there should be
stairs, they're opening up the

887d80e3-4189-4cdf-b057-bd9ed3a4bc12-1
01:24:36.762 --> 01:24:42.875
the tip of the air plane, only
to collide with a truck that is

887d80e3-4189-4cdf-b057-bd9ed3a4bc12-2
01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:48.600
that has some workers, and so
the workers are falling off.

9797440c-7dbf-43b7-95db-5580fadb5328-0
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:56.067
There's the fire truck. They
came speeding to take care of

9797440c-7dbf-43b7-95db-5580fadb5328-1
01:24:56.067 --> 01:24:59.540
the smoke, ran over some of the
workers.

1af6fd7f-ce85-44a0-90e8-54d1746ab900-0
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:03.160
There's.

b6e98ce7-2083-4068-84b0-8e1ebeb98950-0
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.506
Some group of people who are not
very serious about the work

b6e98ce7-2083-4068-84b0-8e1ebeb98950-1
01:25:07.506 --> 01:25:09.140
because they're playing ping
pong.

b4fc22e3-05eb-4751-8f2c-8bed45f835dd-0
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:16.794
There is a man that's trying to
disengage the water hose, but he

b4fc22e3-05eb-4751-8f2c-8bed45f835dd-1
01:25:16.794 --> 01:25:21.285
doesn't know how, so he's still
reading the manual. Oh, and

b4fc22e3-05eb-4751-8f2c-8bed45f835dd-2
01:25:21.285 --> 01:25:25.251
there's Waldo on top of the
water truck. I found him

b4fc22e3-05eb-4751-8f2c-8bed45f835dd-3
01:25:25.251 --> 01:25:26.000
meanwhile.

9d1e018d-0cba-497e-9fd9-f37d5e80dc3e-0
01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:33.066
#END_airport There's another
water truck, which is being

9d1e018d-0cba-497e-9fd9-f37d5e80dc3e-1
01:25:33.066 --> 01:25:39.047
where the hose is being run over
by a baggage train like cargo,

9d1e018d-0cba-497e-9fd9-f37d5e80dc3e-2
01:25:39.047 --> 01:25:44.280
so it's about to have another
accident of some kind. So

9d1e018d-0cba-497e-9fd9-f37d5e80dc3e-3
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.430
there's a lot of chaos.

3390cc26-4070-4118-a5e3-d60ec4ca1ac9-0
01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.720

That was good. Um.

01:25:55.130 --> 01:26:00.840
So they're moving on. So just so
that you know, we have 26.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.083
Items in total and we're now on

01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:08.710
complex scene, OK.}

Can't count how many the
background of this page is.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.800

01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:37.318
Large room where there's almost
like a museum maybe, and it's

07c9691f-2784-496a-a45c-45170679d900-1
01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:42.260
taken over and the picture is at
three levels because the walls

07c9691f-2784-496a-a45c-45170679d900-2
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.350
are covered, the red walls are
covered.

01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:50.547
With portraits and pictures it
looks like it's a portrait

218ec44f-7998-476f-822f-c5f37f60c076-1
01:26:50.547 --> 01:26:53.090
museum, but it is full of
people.

01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:58.975

the portrait. There's a portrait

be in swim trunks. That's
supposed to put together a

03866236-0883-4e21-b5f0-60edbe2f616a-1
01:29:01.288 --> 01:29:07.597
of workers who's trying to put
together a silhouette of a much

03866236-0883-4e21-b5f0-60edbe2f616a-2
01:29:07.597 --> 01:29:13.405
more modern, like very big
pictures of two faces. One is,

03866236-0883-4e21-b5f0-60edbe2f616a-3
01:29:13.405 --> 01:29:16.810
upside down is, the other one
is.

0467e931-a26e-41c6-a519-bf67ec1bf6da-0
01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:20.740
Is is a big picture

001a8049-b45d-4071-9176-6020b08a3ff1-0
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:24.950
Maybe utilizing more modern art.

87f05fea-32b0-4a5e-a43b-bf9bc5f261f9-0
01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:32.126
Um, on to the second floor.
There's also lots of people who

87f05fea-32b0-4a5e-a43b-bf9bc5f261f9-1
01:29:32.126 --> 01:29:37.915
are coming and going, some
carrying pictures, some dressed

87f05fea-32b0-4a5e-a43b-bf9bc5f261f9-2
01:29:37.915 --> 01:29:41.840
in medieval, even caveman like
outfits.

cbf8a37f-daca-4c21-a919-16db7f2770ed-0
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:49.063
Hard to tell. It can't be. It
can't Halloween. I don't know.

cbf8a37f-daca-4c21-a919-16db7f2770ed-1
01:29:49.063 --> 01:29:54.737
Hard to tell. There's somebody
who's dressed in a spaceship.

cbf8a37f-daca-4c21-a919-16db7f2770ed-2
01:29:54.737 --> 01:30:00.689
There's a woman that's dressed
and a Flamingo outfit. There's a

cbf8a37f-daca-4c21-a919-16db7f2770ed-3
01:30:00.689 --> 01:30:01.619
man who's.

5c9e5bda-6379-42c2-8c78-239d7b192217-0
01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:05.690
Looks like an Eskimo.

0798d41d-cbb6-4de2-a0a4-71243cbf1e31-0
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:11.060
Um, there's a man that looks
like Dracula?

686a21db-81c3-4fa8-994a-37e176745b54-0
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:19.679
There's a man who's from another
culture carrying like a African

686a21db-81c3-4fa8-994a-37e176745b54-1
01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:23.910
like face that use can be used
as a shield.

575e82a5-29e2-449d-95ae-136b03c17b31-0
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.536
And even there's some people who
are not even human like they

575e82a5-29e2-449d-95ae-136b03c17b31-1
01:30:30.536 --> 01:30:34.991
have, like they're either
wearing costumes of lime

575e82a5-29e2-449d-95ae-136b03c17b31-2
01:30:34.991 --> 01:30:35.690
colored.

77c07a39-b6ae-4d1b-a45b-5c19f7072bbb-0
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:43.200
Outfits and kind of spread out.
I see at least two of them.

195ff98e-9eb9-4110-95a0-b00879e6deb1-0
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:48.790
So not everybody is. Not
everybody is dressed in a

195ff98e-9eb9-4110-95a0-b00879e6deb1-1
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:51.190
costume. Some people are dressed
in

6978d1b3-95cd-44ec-aa83-f62f8c32b737-0
01:30:52.730 --> 01:30:56.783
Normal attire, so they could be
the people who are just coming

6978d1b3-95cd-44ec-aa83-f62f8c32b737-1
01:30:56.783 --> 01:31:00.450
to see the portraits as well as
people who are actually.

06b6339d-36ee-4519-97dc-a550b25fbf2c-0
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:05.851
From the portraits themselves,
it's hard to tell, but there's

06b6339d-36ee-4519-97dc-a550b25fbf2c-1
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:09.955
just a lot of people, a lot of
activity going, probably too

06b6339d-36ee-4519-97dc-a550b25fbf2c-2
01:31:09.955 --> 01:31:14.265
much going on for a museum. And
at the third level, people are

06b6339d-36ee-4519-97dc-a550b25fbf2c-3
01:31:14.265 --> 01:31:18.506
just still continuing to go up
to the third level. People are

06b6339d-36ee-4519-97dc-a550b25fbf2c-4
01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:21.380
looking at all these different
portraits.

0d8f87f4-2f22-4e0c-bf49-0ed49a8a6121-0
01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:28.735
And I think people are still
trying to put up pictures as

0d8f87f4-2f22-4e0c-bf49-0ed49a8a6121-1
01:31:28.735 --> 01:31:31.240
they as the people are already.

5ebd23a8-452c-4b6a-b2ef-490a69e0cee1-0
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:37.218
#END_exhibit-12 Um, here at the
museum to see the portrait

5ebd23a8-452c-4b6a-b2ef-490a69e0cee1-1
01:31:37.218 --> 01:31:39.520
pictures. OK, lots going on.

50d7790b-1230-4fc2-ac02-a7606a1516ed-0
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:45.325
{That was up again about 5
minutes, and this one will be

50d7790b-1230-4fc2-ac02-a7606a1516ed-1
01:31:45.325 --> 01:31:49.890
the last one we do. It's a story
that it's about 20 pages.}

539839dc-73a7-40ab-95d4-09d676bea9d0-0
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.390
{I find it to be a little
familiar, yeah.}

b84ec313-5abd-4421-a1e3-81fc5445f063-0
01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:59.880
#START_journey So the the boy
with the red kite.

c134ed96-f699-42ea-9f6d-03b959ab1bd3-0
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.916
Is now at home with his mother,
who's in the kitchen cooking

c134ed96-f699-42ea-9f6d-03b959ab1bd3-1
01:32:07.916 --> 01:32:13.913
something. The girl is in a
family room of some kind and the

c134ed96-f699-42ea-9f6d-03b959ab1bd3-2
01:32:13.913 --> 01:32:20.303
father is now in his work room,
but he's now on the computer and

c134ed96-f699-42ea-9f6d-03b959ab1bd3-3
01:32:20.303 --> 01:32:22.270
the boy is actually.

92444eaa-5739-400b-bd05-2d07a7230266-0
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.350
At home, sitting on the steps of
his house with a red scooter.

3051f9c3-53cd-4f7c-8eee-adec8544d1c1-0
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:36.505
So the mom is busy in the
kitchen, she's trying to get

3051f9c3-53cd-4f7c-8eee-adec8544d1c1-1
01:32:36.505 --> 01:32:40.714
dinner going, and she's on the
phone. So even though the boy

3051f9c3-53cd-4f7c-8eee-adec8544d1c1-2
01:32:40.714 --> 01:32:45.200
comes into the house with a red
scooter, he's not being he's not

3051f9c3-53cd-4f7c-8eee-adec8544d1c1-3
01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.271
being paid attention to. His
father is also busy doing his

3051f9c3-53cd-4f7c-8eee-adec8544d1c1-4
01:32:49.271 --> 01:32:53.687
work, and so the boy that is now
carrying the red kite is being

3051f9c3-53cd-4f7c-8eee-adec8544d1c1-5
01:32:53.687 --> 01:32:54.240
ignored.

c8f417b9-2db3-4347-bb75-ef4eb7cffa01-0
01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.064
And, um, I guess it's his older
sister who's just sitting on a

c8f417b9-2db3-4347-bb75-ef4eb7cffa01-1
01:33:01.064 --> 01:33:06.697
sofa, also busy with her. She's
not. She's not paying attention

c8f417b9-2db3-4347-bb75-ef4eb7cffa01-2
01:33:06.697 --> 01:33:12.065
to the boy who's now holding the
red ball, so he's feeling a

c8f417b9-2db3-4347-bb75-ef4eb7cffa01-3
01:33:12.065 --> 01:33:13.650
little lonely and.

9b2c44b0-789e-4d54-b7ee-9fd42660e16a-0
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:20.570
Without means to have any he's
not being.

0c12d884-3e79-44fb-b13f-f3835f30aebd-0
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:25.982
Examined or interacted with his
family because nobody wants to

0c12d884-3e79-44fb-b13f-f3835f30aebd-1
01:33:25.982 --> 01:33:29.893
pay attention to him, so he's in
his room with cat sitting on the

0c12d884-3e79-44fb-b13f-f3835f30aebd-2
01:33:29.893 --> 01:33:30.130
bed.

2ee65736-feca-40b1-9e76-bad6e620da0d-0
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:35.635
And then all of a sudden, he
sees the red marker again. He

2ee65736-feca-40b1-9e76-bad6e620da0d-1
01:33:35.635 --> 01:33:36.190
picks it up.

fccc437b-dce3-4314-93ca-ccc12320bd53-0
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:42.310
He then draws again a door, a
red door with a marker, and then

fccc437b-dce3-4314-93ca-ccc12320bd53-1
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:43.260
he escapes.

99e290b0-a910-40ff-8f3d-c598ad4fd8e7-0
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:50.555
He escapes at the same entrance
of the Tree of the Forest that

99e290b0-a910-40ff-8f3d-c598ad4fd8e7-1
01:33:50.555 --> 01:33:55.093
has lots of trees with Christmas
Tree, Christmas lights and

99e290b0-a910-40ff-8f3d-c598ad4fd8e7-2
01:33:55.093 --> 01:33:58.800
Chinese lanterns that's going
through the canal.

f8449961-8adb-4229-9417-912c228bd87a-0
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.850
Or a Meadow.

9a334f85-7c53-4823-9382-d74d05fbd1d2-0
01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:07.360
Um, he gets to the.

09130104-ca4d-49c9-adf7-291bd2097645-0
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:13.780
An area where he can hop on a
boat. He draws a red boat.

009c465c-2e2c-415e-bcbf-027991740b92-0
01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.940
And he sails off.

8a9e006e-90b8-46af-a1c8-feba23c1737a-0
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:26.026
Once again he's his boat is
heading towards this fantasy

8a9e006e-90b8-46af-a1c8-feba23c1737a-1
01:34:26.026 --> 01:34:29.520
like Castle Town that has a
Moat.

32cbb052-6f22-4450-9838-d5524301efa7-0
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:36.480
And he's heading into that
direction. It's during the day.

ae4167f9-9d3b-4de2-9795-672b0e134590-0
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:46.259
Now, unlike the previous story,
he's actually being greeted

ae4167f9-9d3b-4de2-9795-672b0e134590-1
01:34:46.259 --> 01:34:51.069
friendly. There's a group of
military men no longer wearing

ae4167f9-9d3b-4de2-9795-672b0e134590-2
01:34:51.069 --> 01:34:55.799
medieval outfits, but he's
they're now wearing more modern

ae4167f9-9d3b-4de2-9795-672b0e134590-3
01:34:55.799 --> 01:35:00.769
outfits, and they're waving to
the boy, and the boy is waving

ae4167f9-9d3b-4de2-9795-672b0e134590-4
01:35:00.769 --> 01:35:01.170
back.

dc9d2647-688b-428c-aa8d-5daac524c128-0
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:08.400
The boy comes to the edge of
this.

9d415b50-e93f-4f11-81db-451a5ca6a6b4-0
01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:14.034
On his red boat. The red boat is
just about to fall off into a

9d415b50-e93f-4f11-81db-451a5ca6a6b4-1
01:35:14.034 --> 01:35:14.710
waterfall.

1f1e0029-3c67-4e0b-a8eb-3872d2e1fb06-0
01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:21.522
Um, so just as he's about to
fall off, he uses his red marker

1f1e0029-3c67-4e0b-a8eb-3872d2e1fb06-1
01:35:21.522 --> 01:35:23.190
to draw something.

fe123602-83da-4f13-b137-c0bb90f19138-0
01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:31.123
Which is a flying balloon. So he
was able to draw a flying

fe123602-83da-4f13-b137-c0bb90f19138-1
01:35:31.123 --> 01:35:35.793
balloon and he flies off into
the sky. The military, the

fe123602-83da-4f13-b137-c0bb90f19138-2
01:35:35.793 --> 01:35:40.298
modern military people are
waving goodbye to him as he

fe123602-83da-4f13-b137-c0bb90f19138-3
01:35:40.298 --> 01:35:41.199
waves back.

fd6f5a5a-9140-4120-b6c0-f91e3c2a1247-0
01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:51.530
The Purple bird is in the
distance. Oh, OK, now he's

fd6f5a5a-9140-4120-b6c0-f91e3c2a1247-1
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:54.420
actually flying towards a.

efe401a0-c7fe-4351-b97b-671fc3d1feda-0
01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:57.440
Kind of a submarine flying.

8da457fa-2df5-428a-8867-994c7a4380e7-0
01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:05.040
Which is actually getting him
back to this the the man with

8da457fa-2df5-428a-8867-994c7a4380e7-1
01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:11.042
the eraser that was trapped in a
cage. He's now encountering him

8da457fa-2df5-428a-8867-994c7a4380e7-2
01:36:11.042 --> 01:36:16.767
again. So they're actually in
medieval clothes again, and the

8da457fa-2df5-428a-8867-994c7a4380e7-3
01:36:16.767 --> 01:36:18.429
medieval military.

64a61e2e-00de-453a-b807-5094b716a6cd-0
01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:20.890
Uh.

826d18c3-9fd7-4974-9513-c43bf6418e8c-0
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:27.245
Men are trying to capture the
purple bird that's flying away

826d18c3-9fd7-4974-9513-c43bf6418e8c-1
01:36:27.245 --> 01:36:31.846
and the boy is witnessing this
from red balloon. {Sorry, I

826d18c3-9fd7-4974-9513-c43bf6418e8c-2
01:36:31.846 --> 01:36:36.679
gotta sneeze. Ohh, sorry. It's
OK. You might come again. OK.}

7020f4ed-8fc3-4ad8-a53b-e185c59aa40c-0
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:47.216
So the boy is getting closer to
this sky, flying in the sky.

7020f4ed-8fc3-4ad8-a53b-e185c59aa40c-1
01:36:47.216 --> 01:36:52.920
It's a ship that is flying, it
seems to be.

19495cb4-8476-4792-9d38-483371f9cb2b-0
01:36:55.860 --> 01:37:01.890
Um, flying with two other
smaller.

c9b7b612-fb3b-4b0c-b358-51d7c7acb0af-0
01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.780
Balloon like objects.

d7ff8302-311d-442d-990a-e81b5e22c525-0
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.680
The um, the purple bird was
actually captured.

7b88965d-160a-4d1f-adbd-f577a9171854-0
01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:17.737
And is put into the cage and the
boy is observing the bird and

7b88965d-160a-4d1f-adbd-f577a9171854-1
01:37:17.737 --> 01:37:20.030
trying to figure out how to.

108e2d68-18d4-41a1-9db0-b7408eff6d8e-0
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.570
escape and and release him.

4a7a689a-4b83-4141-98a8-59bc3a1aa279-0
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:33.007
So the boy managed to get onto
this ship flying ship and is

4a7a689a-4b83-4141-98a8-59bc3a1aa279-1
01:37:33.007 --> 01:37:39.640
following the bird. The bird is
actually being taken up a tower

4a7a689a-4b83-4141-98a8-59bc3a1aa279-2
01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:45.651
in the cage and the eraser bin
is actually leading him to

4a7a689a-4b83-4141-98a8-59bc3a1aa279-3
01:37:45.651 --> 01:37:48.760
really at the tip of the this.

26d0b411-c830-4120-8098-947dd2459732-0
01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:50.900
Flying ship.

0323ee05-b6ca-4d78-b1d9-8ff0d20e4a7a-0
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:57.157
The bird is now in a cage being
guarded by two medieval men. The

0323ee05-b6ca-4d78-b1d9-8ff0d20e4a7a-1
01:37:57.157 --> 01:38:02.158
boy is actually climbing up to
rescue the bird with his red

0323ee05-b6ca-4d78-b1d9-8ff0d20e4a7a-2
01:38:02.158 --> 01:38:07.242
marker. He's he's climbing up a
ladder so the boy is able to

0323ee05-b6ca-4d78-b1d9-8ff0d20e4a7a-3
01:38:07.242 --> 01:38:10.910
grab the bird in the cage and
the military.

2213a5bc-23a3-4903-9183-ae1c90b46c23-0
01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:16.166
Men were surprised. He's
actually trying to he was

2213a5bc-23a3-4903-9183-ae1c90b46c23-1
01:38:16.166 --> 01:38:21.910
successful in releasing the bird
from the cage. Meanwhile, there

2213a5bc-23a3-4903-9183-ae1c90b46c23-2
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:27.476
are all these military men who
have been told by the racer man

2213a5bc-23a3-4903-9183-ae1c90b46c23-3
01:38:27.476 --> 01:38:32.160
who's at the top giving commands
to capture the boy.

f91189cd-f0d5-4ae3-879d-1dd57d807bb3-0
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:40.593
So the boy's been captured. The
boy loses also his red marker

f91189cd-f0d5-4ae3-879d-1dd57d807bb3-1
01:38:40.593 --> 01:38:42.440
that allows him to be.

d37d70aa-d213-4601-8d08-6b5987673b57-0
01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:49.882
Able to draw the military, the
head of the military eraser man

d37d70aa-d213-4601-8d08-6b5987673b57-1
01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:55.267
is telling him telling his
military men to take the boy,

d37d70aa-d213-4601-8d08-6b5987673b57-2
01:38:55.267 --> 01:39:00.180
and so the boy is being put into
another cage like.

68670d45-9155-40ec-8ea7-0b7c500e20d0-0
01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:06.610
Area. He's flying underneath the
ship, but there is no way for

68670d45-9155-40ec-8ea7-0b7c500e20d0-1
01:39:06.610 --> 01:39:07.630
him to escape.

b8495aca-b889-46a4-89eb-2b9bcf5c2bb7-0
01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.730
Except that the bird.

892ca24a-a734-4abd-ba62-2525dfb20fe7-0
01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:17.620
Finds the boy with the red
marker, and so once again the

892ca24a-a734-4abd-ba62-2525dfb20fe7-1
01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:20.930
bird and the the boy plans to
draw.

c4671d94-6ee8-4bad-85b4-232a6eff22a2-0
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:23.550
Using the red marker.

fb12074b-8172-4aae-a696-8eeecdb36096-0
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:30.220
Oh, and he was able to draw a
red carpet. A flying red carpet.

4eaed5dc-c670-4fd8-b3be-30e29dcd9f77-0
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:37.150
Um, and so he is on the red
carpet flying above the.

d8d45b99-30b8-4074-900b-1793dfa571a7-0
01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:42.040
Ancient city following the
purple bird.

66780b03-90a8-48b0-80c6-3570bcd8195a-0
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.100
And he's still.

fa955485-2a1c-46c7-ba4b-e3d037b10a99-0
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:53.703
Following the red, purple, the
purple bird that is actually

fa955485-2a1c-46c7-ba4b-e3d037b10a99-1
01:39:53.703 --> 01:39:54.960
heading towards.

6fb8b0bf-883a-414e-91af-8d1a1b559ce4-0
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.270
A small island.

03a1052c-2b17-4a5a-95b0-57449f2d30ad-0
01:39:58.670 --> 01:40:02.540
That has one lonely palm tree.

33e4aafb-0bd9-4c69-ab2d-1563888df443-0
01:40:06.490 --> 01:40:11.445
Ohh at the base of the palm tree
is a door that the bird is

33e4aafb-0bd9-4c69-ab2d-1563888df443-1
01:40:11.445 --> 01:40:16.483
telling the boy to go through.
So the bird gets out, the boy

33e4aafb-0bd9-4c69-ab2d-1563888df443-2
01:40:16.483 --> 01:40:21.357
gets off the red carpet and he
climbs through a very small

33e4aafb-0bd9-4c69-ab2d-1563888df443-3
01:40:21.357 --> 01:40:21.770
door.

9ef05658-1109-40ee-bddd-7c46c9c5a50e-0
01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:26.276
That is at the the base of the
the palm tree, and he climbs and

9ef05658-1109-40ee-bddd-7c46c9c5a50e-1
01:40:26.276 --> 01:40:27.060
goes through.

fdba732d-2c88-4cff-860e-fe30e5dc42f3-0
01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.621
The the other end of the door is
actually a mailbox that gets him

fdba732d-2c88-4cff-860e-fe30e5dc42f3-1
01:40:37.621 --> 01:40:43.058
back to his Old Town that he
lives in with familiar people.

fdba732d-2c88-4cff-860e-fe30e5dc42f3-2
01:40:43.058 --> 01:40:48.496
The girl is also able to come
out from the mailbox as being

fdba732d-2c88-4cff-860e-fe30e5dc42f3-3
01:40:48.496 --> 01:40:54.024
rescued by the Purple bird, and
so the girl and the boy, now

fdba732d-2c88-4cff-860e-fe30e5dc42f3-4
01:40:54.024 --> 01:40:59.190
with the red marker and a purple
marker in hand, draws 2

7621bddd-b6f9-4eba-8a6a-f483380c69a6-0
01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:01.540
Circles, one red and one purple.

f29ad127-8461-45c5-9400-b5fe885198bb-0
01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:10.597
And they fly off or they they
don't fly off but they ride off

f29ad127-8461-45c5-9400-b5fe885198bb-1
01:41:10.597 --> 01:41:15.670
in a tangent bicycle the the the
circle shows his red.

52ddf339-67f1-4127-8d4f-5cdd0a146405-0
01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.870
wheell and know her red wheel
and his.

546c1a2b-d48d-4d77-a7bf-f5e560edca70-0
01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:23.764
#END_journey Purple wheel and
they're heading towards a

546c1a2b-d48d-4d77-a7bf-f5e560edca70-1
01:41:23.764 --> 01:41:27.166
direction. The girl is in the
front pointing into a direction,

546c1a2b-d48d-4d77-a7bf-f5e560edca70-2
01:41:27.166 --> 01:41:28.570
and the bird is following.

a0be1360-0021-4f58-b5c8-5d3a800acce2-0
01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.880
{Ohh, that's it. That is it.}
