00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.427
{So continuing with our study,
we're nearing the end. This next

1b32de05-9e03-4463-b9ed-974749cc7c4e-1
00:00:07.427 --> 00:00:11.459
one is a complex scene. So like
you've always done, just

1b32de05-9e03-4463-b9ed-974749cc7c4e-2
00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.916
describe what you see and what
is happening in detail and take

1b32de05-9e03-4463-b9ed-974749cc7c4e-3
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.180
between three and five minutes.}

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.680
{OK, here we go.}

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.250
#START_campsite Um, this is a
scene.

913fb27b-545d-4ede-a1cc-14d7e7566773-0
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.750
Lots of people.

55345d57-b14d-42b0-ace4-de8b7ba3a191-0
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.110
I think it takes place in the
summertime.

7b55acb2-e1bb-4ad3-af57-a6aa9edea9b0-0
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.460
Um, most people are dressed
lightly.

2f9e5616-0778-4383-9d08-6bca7afd143e-0
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.800
It looks to be like a.

7827f57f-d701-48c8-99c3-89d0442b53fa-0
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.420
A camping site.

a1b41254-c5d6-4d20-813f-770b95e52565-0
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.020
With the river going through it.

16fa1a17-7e42-4ceb-9941-6d561d130229-0
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.360
I see various tents 12345678910.

4c200050-5ba5-4438-a8b2-5d066fa56408-0
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.770
Of very about 10 tents of
various sizes and shapes.

7a642f3a-65a8-4c21-ba34-0fc32b090a5c-0
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.000
Um, people putting them
together.

5d65951b-4c92-424b-8ce9-36d8df57dad8-0
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.950
{Sorry.}

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.850
People. People sitting around
having their chat, people having

261e5167-29ae-4195-a9f7-de252321da15-1
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.300
a meal and people listening to
music.

b00dd692-cfa3-4b1c-aa9f-b46fd6ffa120-0
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.140
And trying to inflate a A a
river raft.

86f8a4f8-f24a-437a-9a23-92a70dd7459e-0
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.644
Hmm. So there are some
activities along the river as

86f8a4f8-f24a-437a-9a23-92a70dd7459e-1
00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:28.868
well with people swimming,
there's some mermaid swimming,

86f8a4f8-f24a-437a-9a23-92a70dd7459e-2
00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:30.220
people fishing.

8115152f-f997-4be1-9623-6b62fdb05ef0-0
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.040
On a on a.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.360
Gondola.

6cb31aba-8ed0-4a63-af36-0d1d20578104-0
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.620
As well as one of those boats
that.

35f315e3-8675-4c02-a047-00ff28e308ab-0
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.900
People, I think this one is is
showing people in.

fa5421c1-f759-4f81-bdcf-902fcb680af5-0
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.630
Bodybuilders saying hello.

92bd388a-6175-467b-957e-3af3411c94d7-0
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.810
I also see some RV's in the
background, also campers.

fa6d09be-e728-4290-87c0-9ec05a992065-0
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.670
Some this tends to be more of
the older groups.

41f3af52-5d15-4f4e-935f-a12662bd49c6-0
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.820
And while the people tent to be
more with mixed with kids.

e05b704d-711f-4678-b312-6e611fd78535-0
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.450
Children, I see some.

c7adcfed-71af-47d3-8a4c-2eb3bac271a9-0
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.298
Hikers and bicyclists in the
background along the Oh and some

c7adcfed-71af-47d3-8a4c-2eb3bac271a9-1
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:22.500
runners and.

220d4fca-b8aa-4e99-8b55-056a586c1c13-0
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.620
Along the towards the valley.

9c23975d-1c80-42ca-b959-06de6c5e23fc-0
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.463
And along the river there's
people also walking,

9c23975d-1c80-42ca-b959-06de6c5e23fc-1
00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:40.661
socializing, fishing, sitting by
the river and watching people go

9c23975d-1c80-42ca-b959-06de6c5e23fc-2
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:41.970
by cyclists.

b7b1600f-b919-4e70-b686-afad0b96518b-0
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.090
Ohh very.

aa6d7c43-0c50-4577-82ae-b4d52f228ae8-0
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.170
Uh, very relaxed.

fd815e9e-9e16-4877-b7d4-1e1e34e36111-0
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.650
Atmosphere in general, I do see
there is a.

35602350-99a1-47ee-afc5-1a94e4c57014-0
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.201
An area where I guess the, uh,
the campers hikers have just

35602350-99a1-47ee-afc5-1a94e4c57014-1
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:04.085
arrived back and they're
desperate to have water. They're

35602350-99a1-47ee-afc5-1a94e4c57014-2
00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:08.799
carrying lots of, they're
carrying heavy backpacks and.

da501614-5baa-4ce6-82a4-92b9ec53678a-0
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.580
Hoping to.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.440
Get to the river because they
are looking very tired.

17c3822e-4241-4bcb-981e-beb5398fc969-0
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.950
There's also, um, in the middle
of it. There's a potential.

0c61f030-a9da-4321-85d0-e1e574158d5d-0
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.242
A bull bull fight or pretense of
a bull fight taking place, which

0c61f030-a9da-4321-85d0-e1e574158d5d-1
00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:35.193
is probably not a good idea
because it will. It's it's a

0c61f030-a9da-4321-85d0-e1e574158d5d-2
00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:39.970
child that's trying to get a
bull angry with the Reds.

Cape.

Umm.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.840
There are animals around as
well. I see, I see rabbits,

f0b95d42-266b-4e3f-824a-03db5b22ba5f-1
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.450
birds.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.810
Any other animals think I saw a
dog? One or two dogs.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.500

A river as well as a shark.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.290
And.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.210
There's just a lot of.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.610
Movement.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.330
But nothing that is.

{OK, that was about 5 minutes.
So going along, this next one is

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.522
a graphic novel. There are about
8 pages to this one. So as you

b42a09a2-ec86-4f78-bd60-a441287cd6fe-2
00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:47.611
go through the story and again,
just describe what you see, what

b42a09a2-ec86-4f78-bd60-a441287cd6fe-3
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:51.840
is happening and take between 10
and 15 minutes, OK?}

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.030
{OK.}

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.970
#START_arrival-4 There's a man
taking a shower. I think it's

56ef2710-5f81-4c30-b6ce-dfae70765d9f-1
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.844
early in the morning based on
the light eliminating. He is

56ef2710-5f81-4c30-b6ce-dfae70765d9f-2
00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:08.580
also trying to shave.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.006
Using a small mirror and get
ready for the day and putting on

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:20.194
a vest, tying his shoes,
counting his money, putting on a

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.510
And he's already outside.

dc5c6be7-bdac-420d-bc89-a9ecc8a569b4-0
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.470

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.017
Interesting looking animal with
him. The animal is coming with

229a4814-d90f-4d37-8683-0448d52370f5-1
00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:49.009

there's a scene of utopian or

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.070
Which I think shows where the
man is, which city he is in.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.243

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.960
Some submarines going through.

00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:58.694
seem to be flying in the sky
along with other smaller boat

100e6705-7dcb-4773-835e-d75d3c200f87-2
00:06:58.694 --> 00:06:59.100

2a71e23e-2a77-4f8d-8024-a4d943665cae-0
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.910
boat like.

f4b48cb3-9bd4-426e-b50a-5780c3184b6f-0
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.930
Also flying in the sky.

e15b2e85-2288-49fa-81ef-11fe8a34f6d0-0
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:18.820
Ohh his animal is talking to
another birdlike creature.

5bddc864-5530-4121-a5c8-25d1bf9f2689-0
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.755
Um, at which point the man
starts a conversation with a man

5bddc864-5530-4121-a5c8-25d1bf9f2689-1
00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:28.500
with a woman who was standing
close to him.

72cf4089-cb83-4665-953e-674029d6cffa-0
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:37.266
He inquires he has, they start a
conversation and he asks her

72cf4089-cb83-4665-953e-674029d6cffa-1
00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:44.642
about the about the map points
to a location or an object on

72cf4089-cb83-4665-953e-674029d6cffa-2
00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:45.610
the map.

64baf96d-c922-404f-92e7-4dbd4fa105db-0
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.700

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.090
Or a an instrument with dials.

7f61fe27-72d8-4cc4-93fb-2db44f546598-0
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:10.291
This this actually looks more
like a ticket that comes out and

7f61fe27-72d8-4cc4-93fb-2db44f546598-1
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:12.080

61660cb2-735e-4f68-a926-fb4ab925252b-0
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.438
She seems to be telling him the
time of the ticket, that we're

61660cb2-735e-4f68-a926-fb4ab925252b-1
00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:24.446

to go with the finger 3 sign

61660cb2-735e-4f68-a926-fb4ab925252b-2
00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:24.780
and.

fc612957-6b0b-4381-9e5f-de791eaa7be6-0
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.733
Possibly looking at a watch
meanwhile, she's pointing

fc612957-6b0b-4381-9e5f-de791eaa7be6-1
00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:34.053
towards the destination.
Meanwhile there's still lots of

fc612957-6b0b-4381-9e5f-de791eaa7be6-2
00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:35.569
submarine like, Umm.

3fcc6ba3-9ca6-47b0-8d02-d60fdb6de5eb-0
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.300
Just transportation systems
flying in the sky.

0345d5fd-8ee6-4ae3-8441-1b777d0d186a-0
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.570
Uh.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.610
To which one of them lands.

a57e88a5-af34-4df6-b680-238758ea7fb0-0
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.000
Close to them.

3e69c5ed-df81-4dcb-b70c-8afbb6eef4a8-0
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:53.998
And allows them to enter so the
man and the woman and the

3e69c5ed-df81-4dcb-b70c-8afbb6eef4a8-1
00:08:53.998 --> 00:08:54.700

57e18731-4dd9-4290-be2f-e035140e18df-0
00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.360
Rides the submarine like.

d03e7e67-b2d9-4362-b004-34d9f8072096-0
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.490

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.990
And the ticket was what she
helped him get for this

1d0ca39c-a80b-4c62-bd33-1bd5356e2980-1
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.836
transport. There is a conductor
who is telling him to go to the

1d0ca39c-a80b-4c62-bd33-1bd5356e2980-2
00:09:16.836 --> 00:09:17.750
direction.

dd26d441-4eb4-40ea-aebf-69509fe9c17b-0
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.743
Men on the animal sit together
with the woman the woman seems

dd26d441-4eb4-40ea-aebf-69509fe9c17b-1
00:09:26.743 --> 00:09:28.130
to know more about.

c3ef4615-cda8-491c-b65b-048394d147f3-0
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:36.295
Her city. As they're having a
conversation, the man takes out

c3ef4615-cda8-491c-b65b-048394d147f3-1
00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:38.030
a piece of paper.

77b37462-3d54-475a-a3ac-750def7248a1-0
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.340
From his pocket and shows her.

2946832f-f0f3-4dcf-b832-42e99a459431-0
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.597
Um, sort of like an
identification paper, to which

2946832f-f0f3-4dcf-b832-42e99a459431-1
00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:49.530
she says.

578a476a-89ca-4d7b-9361-fc4a7426138d-0
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.905
To which she responds by also
showing a piece of paper that

578a476a-89ca-4d7b-9361-fc4a7426138d-1
00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:59.300
looks to be an identification
paper.

be10af47-e159-4dc0-83dc-23082aae7608-0
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.820
Umm.

7727784c-4d60-4e93-87db-02400129e89f-0
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.083
The the the scene now zooms in
on the photograph of the

7727784c-4d60-4e93-87db-02400129e89f-1
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:10.781
identification paper and shows a
different story in which the

7727784c-4d60-4e93-87db-02400129e89f-2
00:10:10.781 --> 00:10:15.555
identity of the person on the
identification person. It's hard

7727784c-4d60-4e93-87db-02400129e89f-3
00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:17.449
to tell whether it's her.

8cd46430-bb35-4ef7-935a-53e0fa2b0a11-0
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:25.064
She's reading a book and
somebody takes the book away

8cd46430-bb35-4ef7-935a-53e0fa2b0a11-1
00:10:25.064 --> 00:10:32.338
from her and tries to lock her
in a space, forces her to work

8cd46430-bb35-4ef7-935a-53e0fa2b0a11-2
00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:32.690
on.

14ccc3d6-87e9-4a77-b84d-fea1e798f83f-0
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:41.404
Work on a fire gives the person
there's a person that is forcing

14ccc3d6-87e9-4a77-b84d-fea1e798f83f-1
00:10:41.404 --> 00:10:42.350
the woman.

c771e4dd-6c70-4eee-9357-dc76ea240aac-0
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.857
To add more fuel to the fire, it
looks to be a harsh condition

c771e4dd-6c70-4eee-9357-dc76ea240aac-1
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:53.150
where it's raining and she's
still continuing to work.

9fd36246-c8e4-401f-bd9a-40b7d4afc2dc-0
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.530


f34a70a0-7d29-43c5-b300-6d06ad3e1d76-0
00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.399
She's finding some trouble with
the fire as the rain is causing

f34a70a0-7d29-43c5-b300-6d06ad3e1d76-1
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:07.250
the the fire to stop or create
more smoke. So she rises up on

f34a70a0-7d29-43c5-b300-6d06ad3e1d76-2
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:13.196
the large chimney fire or oven
fire and tries to clean out the

f34a70a0-7d29-43c5-b300-6d06ad3e1d76-3
00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:19.141
chimneys so that the smoke will
dissipate from the chimney and

f34a70a0-7d29-43c5-b300-6d06ad3e1d76-4
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:22.350
not from the opening of the
fire.

6fdcf58a-cf0e-41a3-967e-c82922d2e970-0
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.860
As she's.

f4a150f1-ae20-4bff-aafc-70530d08456e-0
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.046
Up on the top of the chimney,
she sees that there are other

f4a150f1-ae20-4bff-aafc-70530d08456e-1
00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:37.631
people very similar to her who
are forced to do the same kind

f4a150f1-ae20-4bff-aafc-70530d08456e-2
00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:39.480
of Labor and chore of of.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:49.200
Of the hard work of adding fuel
to the numerous rows of chimney.

0025a0f9-3375-4c56-b236-7de577d54652-0
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:55.740
That are shown in this big
complex whether it's a.

3d113807-afbe-4f9c-ad28-1f2da6607585-0
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:02.928
Factory or a city location of
energy plant. It's hard to tell.

3d113807-afbe-4f9c-ad28-1f2da6607585-1
00:12:02.928 --> 00:12:09.226
She's upset and crying, but then
she determines that she has to

3d113807-afbe-4f9c-ad28-1f2da6607585-2
00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:15.228
escape. She sees the door and
uses the shovel to open up the

3d113807-afbe-4f9c-ad28-1f2da6607585-3
00:12:15.228 --> 00:12:15.720
door.

c36fde8b-b6e1-40bb-b875-353115f131d3-0
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.020
As she sees, there are nobody.

1d674a6d-61bf-44dd-9362-99b160db1503-0
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.350
Umm.

c6495add-e126-493a-ab51-eb9ee66f09f0-0
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.610
That is protecting the the key
that allows her to.

11e2ba65-00f3-4a3d-8618-15f3461597b5-0
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.160
Escape.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:39.524
She opens up the door as well as
the the drawer that has her book

bce3d29c-ef6a-47af-99c6-1aa2f2c3b350-1
00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:45.493
that she was forcibly taken away
from. She runs away from the

bce3d29c-ef6a-47af-99c6-1aa2f2c3b350-2
00:12:45.493 --> 00:12:47.899

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.000
And hops on in an empty.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.720
As the story zooms back to the
submarine.

d531dc29-b4be-46f3-b35b-04b0345d23c7-0
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.690

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:45.455
He arrives at his destination,
which seems to be another part

5d002fee-e77a-47ca-aaf4-54a1080b9a7b-1
00:13:45.455 --> 00:13:51.460

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:38.020
For their purchases of of items,
there's a man and a woman.

2237a0c6-6393-496f-a411-2de02c9daa44-0
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.730
negotiating for sale of a fish
like creature.

c4b6cbc3-6b35-419f-ada8-703bee68c62a-0
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:51.297
Meanwhile, the man stops and
points to a picture of a bread

c4b6cbc3-6b35-419f-ada8-703bee68c62a-1
00:14:51.297 --> 00:14:51.840
which

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.720
Um, some items along the wall.

3c926a46-dcc5-4dc0-b730-86d9279ac7d7-0
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.014
That opens, and he's able to
open one box of drawers along

3c926a46-dcc5-4dc0-b730-86d9279ac7d7-1
00:15:09.014 --> 00:15:13.737
the wall that has items he
examines. He tries to figure out

3c926a46-dcc5-4dc0-b730-86d9279ac7d7-2
00:15:13.737 --> 00:15:15.390
what these items are.

f93f051e-2f41-4287-a542-adda89729bd0-0
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:22.450
Into which a boy comes to a boy
along with a.

bf1c5c44-c3a4-4382-9e68-e7ccb3113190-0
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.540
With his father.

3a3fb0c3-672a-4a44-a533-0eae3bc232ad-0
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.660
Happily tries to help him.

a43d3816-d523-4136-96f5-7eca936e4dc4-0
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:31.950
Umm.

b947a86d-d214-4d46-a6a5-f41dc892a17c-0
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.548
The boy and the father thought
that the man was hoping to buy

b947a86d-d214-4d46-a6a5-f41dc892a17c-1
00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:38.290
the plant.

12c4df79-fa3c-409b-9f29-ea5fbd44d243-0
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.963
But a man says no. I'm actually
looking for something that looks

12c4df79-fa3c-409b-9f29-ea5fbd44d243-1
00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:45.190
more like bread.

b0e769de-c6cb-406b-89f0-8cd2ce819a5d-0
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.010
And he points to the book, the
picture in the book.

de2175b9-d53e-4ecd-a6a2-3715fd5443a8-0
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.560
The father then opens another
drawer in the wall and takes

de2175b9-d53e-4ecd-a6a2-3715fd5443a8-1
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:05.023
down another object that looks
kind of like an eggplant or man,

de2175b9-d53e-4ecd-a6a2-3715fd5443a8-2
00:16:05.023 --> 00:16:12.019
then smells the eggplant like
object. The boy is giving the

de2175b9-d53e-4ecd-a6a2-3715fd5443a8-3
00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:18.899
man a big basket and tells the
man to approach the father.

63e2df35-d43c-42c8-acfc-492390e3ffcb-0
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:31.802
The father is now showing the
man various kinds of objects.

63e2df35-d43c-42c8-acfc-492390e3ffcb-1
00:16:31.802 --> 00:16:38.737
There's an object that looks
like a fish's tail. There's a

63e2df35-d43c-42c8-acfc-492390e3ffcb-2
00:16:38.737 --> 00:16:46.024
the the sun is also holding an
object that that looks like an

63e2df35-d43c-42c8-acfc-492390e3ffcb-3
00:16:46.024 --> 00:16:47.200
oxes horn.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.620
The father is tasting a plant.

c6799ee6-5829-4256-87ee-c2e05ca47de0-0
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.550
The sun is holding.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.685
A very large artichoke like
object there's another picture

a41414f0-867c-4017-a114-976c0b9ff819-1
00:17:03.685 --> 00:17:03.960
of.

f1eaa65b-5d39-4019-be9b-4e1dc2f1fb71-0
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.440
Clam like object that the father
is showing.

5ce2cb78-dc9c-49f2-a6c7-7dbd4df3ef3b-0
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.019
There's another object, that
item that the father is trying

5ce2cb78-dc9c-49f2-a6c7-7dbd4df3ef3b-1
00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.090
to show that looks like a.

06917643-83a7-4cf4-9f8c-bff27b01c208-0
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.080
A strawberry with a long tail.

42e58232-bf32-41da-b2d8-52cfa55a35bb-0
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:30.242
The father is trying to sell and
trying to promote these these

42e58232-bf32-41da-b2d8-52cfa55a35bb-1
00:17:30.242 --> 00:17:36.180
items as tasty and hoping that
the hoping that the man will.

0d2581dd-49a4-4731-ae61-49f360f4eecc-0
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:43.625
Encouraging the the the man to
taste the boy shows his interest

0d2581dd-49a4-4731-ae61-49f360f4eecc-1
00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:49.151
and enthusiasm in tasting the
the items. And so the the man

0d2581dd-49a4-4731-ae61-49f360f4eecc-2
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:54.494
also tastes one of the objects.
The boy gives some of the

0d2581dd-49a4-4731-ae61-49f360f4eecc-3
00:17:54.494 --> 00:17:59.099
objects one of the objects to
the animal as well.

b955e784-34d4-4259-a251-637754a8fd4b-0
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.190
Umm.

5d0026d4-79ed-457a-afc5-0fa81c73447e-0
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.629
There seems to be a happy
exchange between the father, the

5d0026d4-79ed-457a-afc5-0fa81c73447e-1
00:18:06.629 --> 00:18:07.250
man and.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.794
The boy or they have been
successful in providing the man

a7324f40-0f59-4d11-9ad0-3357f7fc6782-1
00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:18.400
with many variant variations of.

Objects.

f5912c6d-9d6e-407f-a33a-176763b05fe8-0
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.350
And at the last scene is.

88b7b6da-b010-4040-8f38-20623de9b2aa-0
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:30.650
Is the sun showing the man a
direction in which he and the.

63fada87-db18-490a-9bd3-9cb5b764232b-0
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.220
Father is helping the man get to
that destination.

a63fc123-b053-40ef-aba7-b77185eb36a7-0
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:46.780
The sun continues to encourage
the the man to come to.

f2adebbf-4f54-4699-a1ba-cdb281bf3a69-0
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.850
Um, see what he has in a large
vase.

05661191-1d66-425d-8916-fd1672eeff3e-0
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.360
That is, at the, at the.

04c942a9-5020-454b-aa51-0e7ebe216f4b-0
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.240
Foot of a boat.

7504ed42-4837-4cec-a692-6b5e91731f1c-0
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.240
When the man approaches the the
large pot base.

3946d01f-bd00-484c-bec7-f22317f9b446-0
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.530
There a tail appears.

8ba99b9b-544e-4f2e-9aa2-f84d2cb254fd-0
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.480
Surprising the man.

643965a6-3e02-44ed-b76b-b59e7c229e56-0
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.390
However, um.

0a996bff-298f-46fb-863d-e37a4ba655c5-0
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.992
The father reassures him that
not to be afraid, and instead

0a996bff-298f-46fb-863d-e37a4ba655c5-1
00:19:17.992 --> 00:19:19.580
that boy pulls out.

fb3cc645-83c1-45e0-a0f1-0d3a85db33e6-0
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.026
An animal creature that looks to
have a very large tail and looks

fb3cc645-83c1-45e0-a0f1-0d3a85db33e6-1
00:19:28.026 --> 00:19:29.340
like an owl.

4a71790a-705e-453f-a5ad-1c8682819582-0
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.041
A combination of an owl and a
squirrel with a large lizard

4a71790a-705e-453f-a5ad-1c8682819582-1
00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:35.750
like tail.

9d48f834-918c-42e0-8794-3009a6ea15dc-0
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.110
Father happily points.

f8c1a0bd-59e5-4c65-ade7-6b38878c3058-0
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.187
At the how the animal the the
new animal seemed to have made

f8c1a0bd-59e5-4c65-ade7-6b38878c3058-1
00:19:46.187 --> 00:19:48.650
friends with the man's animal.

9d0398e5-c834-473f-a635-6be4637a1fe7-0
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:56.036
And they're getting to know each
other. They're socializing.

9d0398e5-c834-473f-a635-6be4637a1fe7-1
00:19:56.036 --> 00:20:01.867
Meanwhile, the father is trying
to calm the man down from his

9d0398e5-c834-473f-a635-6be4637a1fe7-2
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.029
surprises. And his his.

48573420-6a03-4251-9bd3-f8c68008d169-0
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.850
For not understanding clearly.

81f4bec6-80fe-4830-aebe-ed7af0c099b1-0
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.300
the animal.

a50a3314-8a40-4dce-84d6-434d3180de9b-0
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.690
And at the same time, he's also
trying to explain to the father

a50a3314-8a40-4dce-84d6-434d3180de9b-1
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.370
and draw.

7d8c4d56-22b0-44fa-aa69-6f2c05fa5f63-0
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.954
Maybe because they don't have
the language. Uh of of common

7d8c4d56-22b0-44fa-aa69-6f2c05fa5f63-1
00:20:23.954 --> 00:20:29.155
language. The man takes out his
books and draws some building

7d8c4d56-22b0-44fa-aa69-6f2c05fa5f63-2
00:20:29.155 --> 00:20:34.693
structures and a very large tail
that is floating in the sky. The

7d8c4d56-22b0-44fa-aa69-6f2c05fa5f63-3
00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:39.140
father looks at that, the
drawing that the man does.

16dd6c1b-570e-4d4b-8e4c-6fc1ffef67c1-0
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.120
And shows a lot of expression
and emotion.

b06560dd-1d3e-4cb7-b27f-cdf821ee13f6-0
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.680
Umm.

8050a120-5a4b-4f3a-b87e-55e164ef205b-0
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:52.760
From which the the the fathers

dcafa758-5af8-40fc-9dec-6c1a181d1188-0

That's. Looks as though the the
man is trying to.

69fd1c4d-8b8e-48a0-a712-d8da4dec9039-0
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.692
#END_arrival-4 Look more
carefully at what the man is

69fd1c4d-8b8e-48a0-a712-d8da4dec9039-1
00:21:01.692 --> 00:21:02.690
trying to show.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.585
And then moving on, this is
another part. Um, it has four

84328788-b2b6-412f-adf6-d6d71756607f-1
00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:14.170

Either river or Bay.

aa02a571-a512-4dd3-ad46-25c0f8923cee-0
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.000
Umm.

Lots of birds. Ohh and.

Owl like structures.

Embedded within the town.

The the man. The father
continues to guide the man.

cc63d0b3-c595-45eb-afc0-0ac7129ee55c-0
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.914
