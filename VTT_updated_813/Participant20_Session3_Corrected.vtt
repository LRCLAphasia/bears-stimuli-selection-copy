00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.557
Alright, it's been a while.
Continuing on now. Yes. OK, so

97da90a8-031c-43ce-a7a6-012007aef290-1
00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:12.039
the job, your memory. We have
complex scenes and graphic

97da90a8-031c-43ce-a7a6-012007aef290-2
00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.442
novels, and this one is a
complex scene to take between

97da90a8-031c-43ce-a7a6-012007aef290-3
00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:21.003
three and five minutes. Describe
what you see and what is

97da90a8-031c-43ce-a7a6-012007aef290-4
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.070
happening in details. OK, here
we go.

5a24f321-4eb9-4fc6-9d39-eb455f50a234-0
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.665
#START_make_a_splash OK, so we
are in another where's Waldo

5a24f321-4eb9-4fc6-9d39-eb455f50a234-1
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.212
book and this one is called
making a splash and so we're

5a24f321-4eb9-4fc6-9d39-eb455f50a234-2
00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:38.090
looking at.

808f02c4-bbfd-47c2-a9c9-6b2c6093d70b-0
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.073
Starting at the top left, we're
looking at a bunch of flumes. If

808f02c4-bbfd-47c2-a9c9-6b2c6093d70b-1
00:00:45.073 --> 00:00:49.503
you know what a flume is, it's a
tube that water goes through and

808f02c4-bbfd-47c2-a9c9-6b2c6093d70b-2
00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:53.396
you ride down it. So as you can
see that sometimes you're

808f02c4-bbfd-47c2-a9c9-6b2c6093d70b-3
00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:55.880
covered up and sometimes you're
not.

1347e342-d465-494c-ae67-9b96ae7c6170-0
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.917
There's all sorts of people,
little people and big people

1347e342-d465-494c-ae67-9b96ae7c6170-1
00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:04.784
going through it. And normally
you wear bathing suits. Oh, I

1347e342-d465-494c-ae67-9b96ae7c6170-2
00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:08.842
see. Everybody I see is wearing
a bathing suit. There's a whole

1347e342-d465-494c-ae67-9b96ae7c6170-3
00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:12.710
crowd of people up at the top
waiting in line, waiting their

1347e342-d465-494c-ae67-9b96ae7c6170-4
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.704
turn to go down. These flumes,
and they're very colorful. Next

1347e342-d465-494c-ae67-9b96ae7c6170-5
00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:18.860
to them is a bunch of palm
trees.

fc98e235-009b-4d15-8e4f-482316e7dbbb-0
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.620
And.

2dedecbf-b8ab-466f-b3af-0fc2a5281835-0
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.830
Water everywhere. It is a like a
water park, and so there is.

e5e7b971-0de8-4d53-827a-98a999347d03-0
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.552
Down below the palm trees,
there's more people floating

e5e7b971-0de8-4d53-827a-98a999347d03-1
00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:38.454
around. I forget it's like
called someplace. It's called a

e5e7b971-0de8-4d53-827a-98a999347d03-2
00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:42.818
lazy river. It's just a a moving
water that goes in one direction

e5e7b971-0de8-4d53-827a-98a999347d03-3
00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:46.984
all around the whole park. And
you ride it on inner tubes. And

e5e7b971-0de8-4d53-827a-98a999347d03-4
00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:51.149
so there's a lot of people. Some
are sharing inner tubes, some

e5e7b971-0de8-4d53-827a-98a999347d03-5
00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.389
are on their own, some are just
floating around.

5b5dca4b-2078-42f7-bcc2-7746ddad3ee3-0
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.369
Real relaxed. And others are
talking to the ones that they're

5b5dca4b-2078-42f7-bcc2-7746ddad3ee3-1
00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.451
with. And then the that Lazy
river goes under a bridge and

5b5dca4b-2078-42f7-bcc2-7746ddad3ee3-2
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:08.671
there's people crossing the
bridge from one part of the park

5b5dca4b-2078-42f7-bcc2-7746ddad3ee3-3
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.300
to the other and somebody
shooting a.

9c63e4ff-cafa-4bad-b2d8-1060d3ef2c74-0
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.933
A water gun. A big old water gun
at the people in the Lazy River.

9c63e4ff-cafa-4bad-b2d8-1060d3ef2c74-1
00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:22.813
You've got a lifeguard. Let me
see if I see more than one. No,

9c63e4ff-cafa-4bad-b2d8-1060d3ef2c74-2
00:02:22.813 --> 00:02:27.462
not right now. So there's a
lifeguard sitting under a white

9c63e4ff-cafa-4bad-b2d8-1060d3ef2c74-3
00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:32.420
umbrella and we just keep going.
There's all kinds of things to

9c63e4ff-cafa-4bad-b2d8-1060d3ef2c74-4
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.146
do in the biggest part of the
pool, so when people land from

9c63e4ff-cafa-4bad-b2d8-1060d3ef2c74-5
00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:40.090
the flumes, they end up in the
water.

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-0
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.175
There is a dock that people are
out on that they could go in and

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-1
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:49.151
out of the water. They're on the
other side. There are slides. So

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-2
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:52.886
now we're on the right side of
the page and there's all sorts

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-3
00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:56.620
of slides that are different
colors of the rainbow and people

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-4
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.054
sliding down those into the
water as well. So if anybody

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-5
00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:03.668
wants to do it more than once,
then they just climb out and

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-6
00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:07.283
people are helping them, you
know, climb out so they can do

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-7
00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:11.078
it again. I actually see at the
end of the dock kind of in the

3839f2d0-5b34-479b-a4f1-ced0647d2bf5-8
00:03:11.078 --> 00:03:11.499
middle.

40f0f917-2ee5-4b23-ba10-d241231881b7-0
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.697
There are stepping stones that
you can see if you can make it

40f0f917-2ee5-4b23-ba10-d241231881b7-1
00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:22.052
across the pool without falling
in to get to the other side, and

40f0f917-2ee5-4b23-ba10-d241231881b7-2
00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:25.100
some are making it and some are
not.

c0cdf426-46b5-4902-8cfc-f4c6e8d457ee-0
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.360
Right in the middle, at the top,
there's a.

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-0
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.887
Must be some
sort of ship. Well, it's a ship.

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-1
00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:38.233
I was going to say a pirate
ship, but I don't see any

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-2
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:42.322
pirates. So it's just a big ship
that that everybody can climb on

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-3
00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:46.102
and they're doing all sorts of
things. They're shooting like

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-4
00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:49.634
water cannons, they're going
down a great big slide, and

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-5
00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:53.475
they're also climbing up some of
the netting that goes up the

d3e4257a-4a20-4ae5-b0b3-dc51620ae72a-6
00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:56.450
mast. So I think that gives you
a good picture. #END_make_a_splash 

ca7c5684-4087-4450-81de-cb914c455357-0
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.071
Good. So that was about four
minutes. Perfect. You need to

ca7c5684-4087-4450-81de-cb914c455357-1
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:08.173
stop me if I'm saying too much.
I will. Don't worry. OK, so

ca7c5684-4087-4450-81de-cb914c455357-2
00:04:08.173 --> 00:04:13.529
we're going on to the next one,
which is also a complex scene,

ca7c5684-4087-4450-81de-cb914c455357-3
00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:13.870
OK?

0035ece7-a329-49c1-82c5-471e544f1c8e-0
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.280
#START_being_a_pirate OK, here's
the pirate ship.

8596a8ed-7d6a-4fda-8a14-1cfceccc801c-0
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.497
This is about being a pirate 250
years ago it says. Interesting.

8596a8ed-7d6a-4fda-8a14-1cfceccc801c-1
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:36.584
So there's one huge pirate ship
right on the left page, and lots

8596a8ed-7d6a-4fda-8a14-1cfceccc801c-2
00:04:36.584 --> 00:04:44.050
of people in it. So I'm assuming
that this is some sort of.

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-0
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.236
Well, what would you say
amusement park, where you can

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-1
00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:54.834
see what it was like because
there's so many people all

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-2
00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:59.596
around and there's some on the
far right side like having

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-3
00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:04.605
picnics and waiting their turn,
and some are fishing off the

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-4
00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:09.203
land. But in in the water
there's the main pirate ship,

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-5
00:05:09.203 --> 00:05:14.294
there's another one to the left
of it and there's a couple of

37d1fdd5-af0e-4f2d-a373-66f0bc419e60-6
00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:15.690
big ships in the.

0da57bb3-56c4-4d5d-8fac-97e4c743d164-0
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.328
Well, I guess just one big ship
in the background and they have

0da57bb3-56c4-4d5d-8fac-97e4c743d164-1
00:05:20.328 --> 00:05:24.786
those skull and crossbone black
flags that let you know it's a

0da57bb3-56c4-4d5d-8fac-97e4c743d164-2
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.900
pirate ship. All the other boats
there are.

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-0
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.928
Like lifeboats. And they are
being rowed with with oars and

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-1
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:40.036
from the people in it. And some
of them have like pirate guides

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-2
00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:44.825
at the front and back and some
do not. So you know, there's

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-3
00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:49.933
obviously some options that you
can do. I see one boat right in

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-4
00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:54.722
the lower bottom right that has
broken and the people, it's

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-5
00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:59.351
broken in half and so all the
people have fallen into the

1cc0e59a-ee1c-4b43-8b31-e7de025b52c9-6
00:05:59.351 --> 00:05:59.830
water.

69b77bfa-50bf-4bd9-b92f-6a1b475f683d-0
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.672
And people are helping them
climb up onto the bank in the

69b77bfa-50bf-4bd9-b92f-6a1b475f683d-1
00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:08.360
very middle of the page. there
is a octopus.

220eabc6-f7d8-4d40-b5dc-e6f0f5fc49f4-0
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.313
I would think that it is a fake
octopus because octopuses don't

220eabc6-f7d8-4d40-b5dc-e6f0f5fc49f4-1
00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:20.225
go up like that out of the water
to just find people. But it

220eabc6-f7d8-4d40-b5dc-e6f0f5fc49f4-2
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:24.734
looks like it's grasping a
couple of people in the top,

220eabc6-f7d8-4d40-b5dc-e6f0f5fc49f4-3
00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:29.324
which is interesting to me
because I don't know how they

220eabc6-f7d8-4d40-b5dc-e6f0f5fc49f4-4
00:06:29.324 --> 00:06:31.739
would make that happen anyway.

6979b500-697c-494b-baa3-db5ddc654c40-0
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.540
Other than that.

f0bc26c2-d242-4f61-bee4-547611a51f3f-0
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.038
Most of the people are just
involved in seeing what the

f0bc26c2-d242-4f61-bee4-547611a51f3f-1
00:06:39.038 --> 00:06:42.882
Pirates are doing and going back
and forth to the boat, but

f0bc26c2-d242-4f61-bee4-547611a51f3f-2
00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:46.855
apparently a lot of the fun part
of it is getting wet because

f0bc26c2-d242-4f61-bee4-547611a51f3f-3
00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:50.380
they're still, you know, a lot
of people in the water.

e4a8c68c-ad64-4e8e-999c-c7c56df1c4d0-0
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.515
Not being
afraid. Somebody's diving into

e4a8c68c-ad64-4e8e-999c-c7c56df1c4d0-1
00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.840
the water, and that's probably
part of the fun of it. #END_being_a_pirate

0fc60018-b57a-4a6f-b17d-239e2f894ad6-0
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.610
I think that's it. OK, that was
about 3 minutes to move on.

5da620a8-6112-4f49-9803-beb4daadcf12-0
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.080
OK, we got another one of
these.

7a32f6a7-e9bb-4119-bcab-fcfb11cdf517-0
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.070
Ooh.

73521bbf-0786-4dc4-b23c-1468f07111bf-0
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.697
Kind of tiny. Yeah, it is.
That's OK. OK.

73521bbf-0786-4dc4-b23c-1468f07111bf-1
00:07:20.697 --> 00:07:26.414
#START_ancient_rome This is
called fun and games in ancient

73521bbf-0786-4dc4-b23c-1468f07111bf-2
00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:28.320
Rome 2000 years ago.

6fd66b14-4f82-4476-96ed-a3486b16fc4f-0
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.490
So looking at the whole picture.

52612b12-ccee-4f02-b527-6c519ff77927-0
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.710
This is in what they called the
Colosseum back in those days.

11e068fa-1062-418b-8314-da7b7e6f0a6e-0
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.060
And.

f323ca42-1f38-495d-8e9d-cf83217ba66b-0
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.660
So it's all a round um.

f84a5c3a-5567-40b3-b15f-6b55f37ee672-0
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:52.843
Arena and above the arena you
see all of the spectators and

f84a5c3a-5567-40b3-b15f-6b55f37ee672-1
00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:59.724
the spectators normally, I mean,
they're looking at everything

f84a5c3a-5567-40b3-b15f-6b55f37ee672-2
00:07:59.724 --> 00:08:01.800
that's going on up.

dfbc4bfa-0e97-4536-8afd-aa2856801820-0
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:08.661
You can see them all the way
around, but on the upper right

dfbc4bfa-0e97-4536-8afd-aa2856801820-1
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:15.264
hand part you can see the people
who are special. There is a flag

dfbc4bfa-0e97-4536-8afd-aa2856801820-2
00:08:15.264 --> 00:08:21.566
hanging on the Colosseum wall
that shows the Roman crown. It's

dfbc4bfa-0e97-4536-8afd-aa2856801820-3
00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:27.968
a crown of Laurel and up above
it, way up above it you see must

dfbc4bfa-0e97-4536-8afd-aa2856801820-4
00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:32.870
be the Caesar, the Emperor on a
like a big sofa.

564a555f-6609-4071-bd05-19f951900b05-0
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:38.665
Some fancy thing. And all around
our soldiers, the Roman

564a555f-6609-4071-bd05-19f951900b05-1
00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:45.061
centurions, and they're in their
their outfits with their hats,

564a555f-6609-4071-bd05-19f951900b05-2
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:46.660
helmets and and.

ef1ea8ba-82d3-4ae9-aa24-6b60577a9fec-0
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.114
Shields and their uniforms and
they are all in front of him and

ef1ea8ba-82d3-4ae9-aa24-6b60577a9fec-1
00:08:53.114 --> 00:08:58.806
then up along the sides as well.
Well, the Roman arena was known

ef1ea8ba-82d3-4ae9-aa24-6b60577a9fec-2
00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:04.410
for a lot of things, and you've
got horses and Chariots down in

ef1ea8ba-82d3-4ae9-aa24-6b60577a9fec-3
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.840
the bottom left there for the
chariot races and they're going

ef1ea8ba-82d3-4ae9-aa24-6b60577a9fec-4
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.831
around. One of them has the
horse. That's funny, has the

ef1ea8ba-82d3-4ae9-aa24-6b60577a9fec-5
00:09:14.831 --> 00:09:18.860
horse holding the reins while
the people run.

5579e548-3581-4996-aedd-80802041253e-0
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.650
And of course, that's just for
fun, because you know that won't

5579e548-3581-4996-aedd-80802041253e-1
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.452
happen. There are a lot of wild
animals in there, and

5579e548-3581-4996-aedd-80802041253e-2
00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:34.609
unfortunately the Romans were
known for putting people in

5579e548-3581-4996-aedd-80802041253e-3
00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:40.300
fights against wild animals. So
you see some leopards there, at

5579e548-3581-4996-aedd-80802041253e-4
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.813
least one couple of tigers, but
a lot of lions. And the lions

5579e548-3581-4996-aedd-80802041253e-5
00:09:45.813 --> 00:09:49.369
are in various places, but over
on the.

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-0
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.863
Upper left there is a whole
bunch of lions that apparently

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-1
00:09:53.863 --> 00:09:58.736
are the smart ones, and they've
decided they know how to get out

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-2
00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:03.160
of the colosseum by forming a
pyramid and standing on each

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-3
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.808
other's backs. So you've got all
three on the bottom and then

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-4
00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:12.382
two, and they're climbing up,
going into the stands and that

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-5
00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:17.180
part of the stands. You see the
spectators all running away and

c8098068-a395-4c72-9270-2ca5075d2735-6
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.280
leaving their stuff because.

5cd24d6d-50ab-461c-9988-9a33fe3460a0-0
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.639
Those lions have come into the
area where the spectators are

5cd24d6d-50ab-461c-9988-9a33fe3460a0-1
00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:26.250
and none of them want that to
happen.

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-0
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.475
It looks like some of the Roman
centurions are standing around

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-1
00:10:32.475 --> 00:10:37.032
the lions, but they don't know
what to do because they're doing

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-2
00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:41.019
nothing. Some of them are
holding their heads, some are

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-3
00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:45.647
just, you know, like looking at
at at the situation. But they're

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-4
00:10:45.647 --> 00:10:49.634
not going after the lions
because they don't want to be

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-5
00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:53.408
involved in all of that. I
think. I think that's it.

04a656cf-ad45-420b-b0e0-26ad0df0e6c2-6
00:10:53.408 --> 00:10:57.680
There's a lot of activity in
that arena. There's, you know.

88681292-4a3d-4b93-8a55-14c4a3c0e4dc-0
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.714
It they
there's a saying called the

88681292-4a3d-4b93-8a55-14c4a3c0e4dc-1
00:11:00.714 --> 00:11:03.870
Three Ring circus. It's a lot
more than that. You could look

88681292-4a3d-4b93-8a55-14c4a3c0e4dc-2
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.975
at anything and see stuff that
would be enjoyable and stuff

88681292-4a3d-4b93-8a55-14c4a3c0e4dc-3
00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:08.010
that would be scary. #END_ancient_rome

573d5362-75f9-4ceb-98a1-7bcfb9ddfa51-0
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.460
OK, perfect. That was 4
minutes. Good.

aeb0ab56-ddbe-4b05-a67d-ff71d75d9d72-0
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:18.574
OK, so we're now going to see a
graphic novel, or part of it.

aeb0ab56-ddbe-4b05-a67d-ff71d75d9d72-1
00:11:18.574 --> 00:11:21.470
OK, this one has around 3
pages.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.010
Hmm.

95f6b477-57fa-4afd-96a0-2237196afc0c-0
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.740
Haven't seen this in a while.

da694d24-be7b-4e5d-bbf1-f80f4d0574a4-0
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.230
OK.

c8f22856-b6ee-4ecd-921d-f1cdf0a7d71f-0
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.886
#START_arrival_2 We are back to
the sepia toned pictures and on

c8f22856-b6ee-4ecd-921d-f1cdf0a7d71f-1
00:11:37.886 --> 00:11:43.123
the left hand side there is a
series of 12 pictures. On the

c8f22856-b6ee-4ecd-921d-f1cdf0a7d71f-2
00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:48.534
right hand side there's a big
picture at the bottom and three

c8f22856-b6ee-4ecd-921d-f1cdf0a7d71f-3
00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:53.858
pictures at the top. So we'll
start on the left side. On the

c8f22856-b6ee-4ecd-921d-f1cdf0a7d71f-4
00:11:53.858 --> 00:11:56.390
left side we see pictures of.

98ca06ed-6524-465c-a825-dda224f53dde-0
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.630
People waiting.

e739ce97-55b3-4579-9056-b74f6f2da500-0
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:04.131
Um, looks like a mother and. Or
a man and wife maybe. I don't

e739ce97-55b3-4579-9056-b74f6f2da500-1
00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:08.870
know. Then in the middle there
are three men waiting. They look

e739ce97-55b3-4579-9056-b74f6f2da500-2
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.313
like they're getting ready to
travel. There's a suitcase in

e739ce97-55b3-4579-9056-b74f6f2da500-3
00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:17.830
both of those pictures, and then
the top right picture has a

e739ce97-55b3-4579-9056-b74f6f2da500-4
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.273
woman and a baby and a man
walking away or with his back to

e739ce97-55b3-4579-9056-b74f6f2da500-5
00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:22.570
her.

a0b37fca-c5d8-4b91-8153-4d2cde2406df-0
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.933
It looks like that man goes down
to the next picture and he's

a0b37fca-c5d8-4b91-8153-4d2cde2406df-1
00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:36.027
pulled out some paper in a book,
and then in the next series of

a0b37fca-c5d8-4b91-8153-4d2cde2406df-2
00:12:36.027 --> 00:12:42.216
pictures he is writing and then
tearing out a piece of paper and

a0b37fca-c5d8-4b91-8153-4d2cde2406df-3
00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:43.740
then folding it.

66d2d3f2-8cda-42fd-a03e-786da7d13bbd-0
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:50.153
In 1 2 3 pictures he's folding
it to be like an origami swan

66d2d3f2-8cda-42fd-a03e-786da7d13bbd-1
00:12:50.153 --> 00:12:55.016
and and then or a crane. I don't
know the difference in how they

66d2d3f2-8cda-42fd-a03e-786da7d13bbd-2
00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:59.430
make them. And then down at the
bottom he's looking at it.

85d0b239-3fb2-4e94-a975-9af577bc261d-0
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.100
He.

d1c53d6a-382e-4547-800f-4d1f3bfacd99-0
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.498
He looks around him and then,
um, I can't tell if he's let it

d1c53d6a-382e-4547-800f-4d1f3bfacd99-1
00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:12.392
go or not because he's near his
suitcase again and it looks like

d1c53d6a-382e-4547-800f-4d1f3bfacd99-2
00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:16.834
it might be in his hand, but
it's pretty small and I can't

d1c53d6a-382e-4547-800f-4d1f3bfacd99-3
00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:21.276
tell. So on the next page you
see this man looking around.

d1c53d6a-382e-4547-800f-4d1f3bfacd99-4
00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:24.740
He's looking up into the sky and
now he sees.

4abba6ab-287d-48aa-8c5a-9569569e5f3c-0
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:31.543
He sees a lot of white birds in
the sky, which to me would have

4abba6ab-287d-48aa-8c5a-9569569e5f3c-1
00:13:31.543 --> 00:13:36.128
been like what he would have
released as as his origami bird.

4abba6ab-287d-48aa-8c5a-9569569e5f3c-2
00:13:36.128 --> 00:13:40.787
And we see the whole scene now
that all of these people are on

4abba6ab-287d-48aa-8c5a-9569569e5f3c-3
00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:45.298
a steamship of sorts. You see
the water in the background, a

4abba6ab-287d-48aa-8c5a-9569569e5f3c-4
00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:49.440
lot of big pipes from the
steamship and people on deck.

135e74bb-9961-4fa8-919f-4a6cfe637aa2-0
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.420
OK, so.

9fdf5636-ad74-44b8-95cd-39cd4d24dbb4-0
00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:04.540
Now we see um on both sides of
the page. A panoramic picture

9fdf5636-ad74-44b8-95cd-39cd4d24dbb4-1
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:04.900
of.

1f0ef9f1-4685-4898-952d-d89ee3aaf526-0
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.920
The harbor of a big city.

ca6ccfb3-a32d-4188-96eb-51b11a85464f-0
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.007
And you see the people on the
boat still looking into this

ca6ccfb3-a32d-4188-96eb-51b11a85464f-1
00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:21.041
city harbor, there's some small
boats, there's another

ca6ccfb3-a32d-4188-96eb-51b11a85464f-2
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:25.661
reasonable size boat and then
some great big boats. And on the

ca6ccfb3-a32d-4188-96eb-51b11a85464f-3
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:30.428
left hand side you see the city
in the background and it's a big

ca6ccfb3-a32d-4188-96eb-51b11a85464f-4
00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:34.829
city with a lot of skyscrapers
and you see some other barge

ca6ccfb3-a32d-4188-96eb-51b11a85464f-5
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:39.010
type big boats in the foreground
on the right hand side.

d39f05a3-af82-4a55-adef-88b53ae06e28-0
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.756
There are it looks like it's the
same city and the same scene,

d39f05a3-af82-4a55-adef-88b53ae06e28-1
00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:53.091
but I could be wrong. At any
rate, we're now seeing what I

d39f05a3-af82-4a55-adef-88b53ae06e28-2
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:57.070
what seems to be a close up or
or just big.

80d605a0-a4fc-483d-b471-ad587e6260af-0
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.060
Statues and it's

6573dd29-c8ec-4775-8033-bd9afed11ecd-0
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.070
Two boats.

f29831e7-7a5d-4894-9e03-7952c64bd2ee-0
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.470
With

76295eae-8ad9-4787-ad10-92157b3043fe-0
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:11.632
Like utensils and pots in them,
and the one on the left has a

76295eae-8ad9-4787-ad10-92157b3043fe-1
00:15:11.632 --> 00:15:16.460
suitcase. And then there's two
big people, one with a

7f2285c3-0c1b-4436-af8d-4b47bdbc1abb-0
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.334
Rodent type animal on the left
on his arm and one on the right

7f2285c3-0c1b-4436-af8d-4b47bdbc1abb-1
00:15:23.334 --> 00:15:28.509
with a bird on his shoulder and
they're shaking hands. And to me

7f2285c3-0c1b-4436-af8d-4b47bdbc1abb-2
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:33.444
right now I can't make sense of
of where they are because all

7f2285c3-0c1b-4436-af8d-4b47bdbc1abb-3
00:15:33.444 --> 00:15:38.220
the other boats are small and
normal sized and these are so

7f2285c3-0c1b-4436-af8d-4b47bdbc1abb-4
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.757
big and the people are so
outsized that I have to say it

7f2285c3-0c1b-4436-af8d-4b47bdbc1abb-5
00:15:42.757 --> 00:15:44.349
looks like a statue.

f378340e-e267-4145-844a-d3fcbc7edf21-0
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.173
Ah, so now we see the white
birds, oh, we see the big boat

f378340e-e267-4145-844a-d3fcbc7edf21-1
00:15:57.173 --> 00:16:01.682
that these people are on, or
that's what I think it is from

f378340e-e267-4145-844a-d3fcbc7edf21-2
00:16:01.682 --> 00:16:06.040
the front coming into this
harbor with other boats around

f378340e-e267-4145-844a-d3fcbc7edf21-3
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.774
them. And those white birds are
all around the boat, flying up

f378340e-e267-4145-844a-d3fcbc7edf21-4
00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:15.584
into the air around it. And you
see all the people still on the

f378340e-e267-4145-844a-d3fcbc7edf21-5
00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:15.960
deck.

687e9b6a-617b-4bc2-82ec-b82929c90f46-0
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.548
And then we see on the right,
that's one big picture on the

687e9b6a-617b-4bc2-82ec-b82929c90f46-1
00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:26.138
left, on the right, we then see
the people waiting. We see

687e9b6a-617b-4bc2-82ec-b82929c90f46-2
00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:30.728
someone giving them directions,
them opening the gates and

687e9b6a-617b-4bc2-82ec-b82929c90f46-3
00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:35.707
people grabbing their suitcases
and beginning to move and going

687e9b6a-617b-4bc2-82ec-b82929c90f46-4
00:16:35.707 --> 00:16:36.330
down the

7b3fa48c-822d-4756-a4bd-65378478654f-0
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.930
The walkway

f0705b11-e77f-4875-b610-cbb4a598092b-0
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.858
Where this man
was still giving direction, he's

f0705b11-e77f-4875-b610-cbb4a598092b-1
00:16:44.858 --> 00:16:48.045
standing there making sure
they're doing what they're

f0705b11-e77f-4875-b610-cbb4a598092b-2
00:16:48.045 --> 00:16:51.704
supposed to. And so the bottom
picture then shows us with all

f0705b11-e77f-4875-b610-cbb4a598092b-3
00:16:51.704 --> 00:16:55.422
of these people who had been on
the boat, standing on the dock

f0705b11-e77f-4875-b610-cbb4a598092b-4
00:16:55.422 --> 00:16:59.022
or the OR the land with their
suitcases in hand and the ship

f0705b11-e77f-4875-b610-cbb4a598092b-5
00:16:59.022 --> 00:17:02.210
is in the background, but
they're not moving anymore. #END_arrival_2 

c8fd0662-8353-4623-939d-13c656ed5aa5-0
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:10.919
OK, alright. That was this part
of this story. We'll move on. So

c8fd0662-8353-4623-939d-13c656ed5aa5-1
00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:16.260
this one is really long. Long.
OK, have you can.

a489673c-b0ed-4954-bebe-c88c643c3a01-0
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:23.191
Feel free to go slightly
quicker. OK, we'll do. Yeah,

a489673c-b0ed-4954-bebe-c88c643c3a01-1
00:17:23.191 --> 00:17:28.160
that's a long one. We'll do it.
OK, let's start. OK.

8823d27f-4f3c-4685-9f23-115d43f7bb4c-0
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.555
#START_wanderer Undo book. OK,
so we have two characters on the

8823d27f-4f3c-4685-9f23-115d43f7bb4c-1
00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:42.975
left side in six pictures, and
they're creating something and

8823d27f-4f3c-4685-9f23-115d43f7bb4c-2
00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:43.150
it

f2c99249-9389-4260-abe7-d2f3f61b0c72-0
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.250
It looks like one is in a
costume.

ba30bee7-8772-4862-9ef4-e33095f8f7d4-0
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.400
And one is not um.

1d4b24c6-9110-4582-80f1-d88fcdb17405-0
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.673
It looks like a a man or a boy
and and another large adult in a

1d4b24c6-9110-4582-80f1-d88fcdb17405-1
00:17:56.673 --> 00:17:59.190
costume that has horns and

cf3c3690-96cc-461c-9cc7-e1a48bc96639-0
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.420
I can't tell what else right now
they have this huge sheet of

3ad9a3fb-b1a8-412d-b8ed-88ebf7a34cbb-0
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.527
What I will say is probably
paper because of the way that

3ad9a3fb-b1a8-412d-b8ed-88ebf7a34cbb-1
00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:15.058
they're folding it, it folds
pretty easily and they're making

3ad9a3fb-b1a8-412d-b8ed-88ebf7a34cbb-2
00:18:15.058 --> 00:18:19.807
what might look like a hat, but
it's also like a boat. And so on

3ad9a3fb-b1a8-412d-b8ed-88ebf7a34cbb-3
00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:20.100
the.

0c5623f2-fc5a-4e2a-b559-a9c1544f9bae-0
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:27.597
When they finish making it, you
see on the right hand page a big

0c5623f2-fc5a-4e2a-b559-a9c1544f9bae-1
00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:33.435
ship in the water and the
little, I'm going to call it a

0c5623f2-fc5a-4e2a-b559-a9c1544f9bae-2
00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:36.609
paper boat, is off to the side.

3ff804f6-f456-4f57-ad8a-af84248c3b59-0
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.854
Then we see from above the
little boat, only with a lot of

3ff804f6-f456-4f57-ad8a-af84248c3b59-1
00:18:47.854 --> 00:18:53.432
birds flying above it and a
great expanse of water with a

3ff804f6-f456-4f57-ad8a-af84248c3b59-2
00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:55.260
lot of waves. Yeah.

29fdc6d5-8e27-4c32-9346-2e0dce2430b1-0
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.053
OK, so now in this great expanse
of water with waves, pointy

29fdc6d5-8e27-4c32-9346-2e0dce2430b1-1
00:19:08.053 --> 00:19:13.817
waves like little mountains, you
see the birds above, and these

29fdc6d5-8e27-4c32-9346-2e0dce2430b1-2
00:19:13.817 --> 00:19:18.590
sea creatures looks like three
of them looking like.

2dae396c-6229-45a6-b5a1-202952f4b030-0
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.201
Uh, oddly shaped turtles with
squares of black and white on

2dae396c-6229-45a6-b5a1-202952f4b030-1
00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:29.022
their back. Two of them are
right by the boat looking up out

2dae396c-6229-45a6-b5a1-202952f4b030-2
00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:33.843
of the water at it, and one is
still just swimming. And then

2dae396c-6229-45a6-b5a1-202952f4b030-3
00:19:33.843 --> 00:19:38.426
there is this huge creature on
the right that the boat is

2dae396c-6229-45a6-b5a1-202952f4b030-4
00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:43.168
approaching. It's huge. It's
probably 100 times bigger than

2dae396c-6229-45a6-b5a1-202952f4b030-5
00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:43.880
the boat.

33244dbe-a1c2-4603-9288-1cf3ec18a273-0
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:47.720
Now.

5acf1a62-564e-4b92-9f62-b3cb1da33891-0
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:53.407
Where the next page shows us
that we're under the water and

5acf1a62-564e-4b92-9f62-b3cb1da33891-1
00:19:53.407 --> 00:19:58.396
we see what's happening under
the water where the boat is up

5acf1a62-564e-4b92-9f62-b3cb1da33891-2
00:19:58.396 --> 00:20:03.548
on top. And that huge thing that
we saw is actually one of the

5acf1a62-564e-4b92-9f62-b3cb1da33891-3
00:20:03.548 --> 00:20:08.864
fins, I guess I would call it of
a whale type creature and we're

5acf1a62-564e-4b92-9f62-b3cb1da33891-4
00:20:08.864 --> 00:20:13.690
in the undersea now and that
whale creature is the biggest

5acf1a62-564e-4b92-9f62-b3cb1da33891-5
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.270
down there, but there are many,
many others. There's a.

177e3203-4ecc-44bc-b4fc-a109c59148c6-0
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:24.351
Sailfish and lots of schooling
fish in in rotating forms. The

177e3203-4ecc-44bc-b4fc-a109c59148c6-1
00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:30.463
fish are of all different sizes
and they're beautiful. You also

177e3203-4ecc-44bc-b4fc-a109c59148c6-2
00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:36.480
see corals and and probably some
seaweed on a big mass over to

177e3203-4ecc-44bc-b4fc-a109c59148c6-3
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:42.688
the right hand side and the rest
is just fish. Here I am looking

177e3203-4ecc-44bc-b4fc-a109c59148c6-4
00:20:42.688 --> 00:20:46.700
for the the turtles and I don't
see them.

030c8a1f-9631-4a00-8ab2-97c26d9c00b0-0
00:20:52.780 --> 00:21:00.710
OK, now we're looking at the
boat still above the water, but.

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-0
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.371
They probably from the boat can
see all kinds of things now

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-1
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:10.403
because there's not a lot of
water underneath them before

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-2
00:21:10.403 --> 00:21:14.643
they see the the life, the sea
life. And there are fish that

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-3
00:21:14.643 --> 00:21:18.745
are actually appearing to be
coming out of the water where

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-4
00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:23.124
they would see them right away
because it's a big like jumping

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-5
00:21:23.124 --> 00:21:27.504
school. Other than that we see
beautiful fan shaped corals and

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-6
00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:31.814
everything and it looks like
there's some sort of eel over on

d71efa6f-5867-406c-84f6-6901ee83062b-7
00:21:31.814 --> 00:21:32.440
the left.

493866cc-ecc0-475a-bb94-68476c32bcd7-0
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.590
Other than that, it's more of
the same. Big beautiful fish and

493866cc-ecc0-475a-bb94-68476c32bcd7-1
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.235
everything is in black and
white. I didn't even say that.

493866cc-ecc0-475a-bb94-68476c32bcd7-2
00:21:40.235 --> 00:21:40.550
Yeah.

edbcafec-633b-4274-9a4a-5ae5badd5c50-0
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:52.352
Ohh OK now there's two scenes on
the left. You have the boat and

edbcafec-633b-4274-9a4a-5ae5badd5c50-1
00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:57.860
there's a squid like creature.
There are several of them

edbcafec-633b-4274-9a4a-5ae5badd5c50-2
00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.500
swimming up toward the boat and
one of them is.

5e7f018f-a55c-4ac8-85be-5c62e9180401-0
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.088
Touching the boat it looks like
it might be trying to find out

5e7f018f-a55c-4ac8-85be-5c62e9180401-1
00:22:09.088 --> 00:22:13.220
what it is. You have two fish
kissing down underneath by the

5e7f018f-a55c-4ac8-85be-5c62e9180401-2
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.050
coral, and other than that.

f1e78bf5-da05-41ed-ab64-c7fef3268d62-0
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.370
Oh, those two fish kissing have
fish heads and.

5e27fb09-c19b-4101-ad5d-189df210087c-0
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.672
And then they have bodies that
are standing up so that the head

5e27fb09-c19b-4101-ad5d-189df210087c-1
00:22:25.672 --> 00:22:30.492
is the fish part and then
there's bodies and arms that's

5e27fb09-c19b-4101-ad5d-189df210087c-2
00:22:30.492 --> 00:22:35.313
unique. And then the other, all
the other fish look like

5e27fb09-c19b-4101-ad5d-189df210087c-3
00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:40.810
tropical fish. On the right hand
side, you now see that there is

5e27fb09-c19b-4101-ad5d-189df210087c-4
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.968
a fishing pole coming from the
paper boat up on top and they

5e27fb09-c19b-4101-ad5d-189df210087c-5
00:22:45.968 --> 00:22:50.620
have caught a fish on the end
and several of the fish.

5787cc5d-c571-4595-88e4-32a83185650e-0
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.964
Are looking at that and the fish
person that I told you about

5787cc5d-c571-4595-88e4-32a83185650e-1
00:22:55.964 --> 00:23:01.218
before now has scissors in their
hands and are looking at the

5787cc5d-c571-4595-88e4-32a83185650e-2
00:23:01.218 --> 00:23:05.880
fish that was caught. Like I
need to rescue this fish.

cac4ed5f-c4ce-4316-b970-2168d70e94e7-0
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.440
So.

1e0e980a-87be-4daa-ab7e-1d2b8140c16d-0
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.180
Two pictures on the left hand
side.

00994297-4ac6-428d-90fd-96a2db1d1d8f-0
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:24.440
Um, you see fish kind of
forming. No, they're not forming

00994297-4ac6-428d-90fd-96a2db1d1d8f-1
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.168
a column. They're on a column of
big, big coral. And one of the

00994297-4ac6-428d-90fd-96a2db1d1d8f-2
00:23:30.168 --> 00:23:35.717
fish that's big is holding up a
sea horse on top of his head,

00994297-4ac6-428d-90fd-96a2db1d1d8f-3
00:23:35.717 --> 00:23:41.266
looking at the boat. And the
seahorse has like a paper hat on

00994297-4ac6-428d-90fd-96a2db1d1d8f-4
00:23:41.266 --> 00:23:46.905
his head that looks similar to
the boat on the next picture on

00994297-4ac6-428d-90fd-96a2db1d1d8f-5
00:23:46.905 --> 00:23:47.800
the right.

5297216d-8967-48ba-96ec-8e43fe26ed42-0
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.850
There is. Uh, you see, the
seahorse is in the boat.

52c0a160-32a6-48e4-a3c0-ab752ee453de-0
00:23:53.550 --> 00:24:00.337
And he does have a paper hat on
his head, and there is something

52c0a160-32a6-48e4-a3c0-ab752ee453de-1
00:24:00.337 --> 00:24:00.860
long.

fd575f2e-4a03-41e4-a39c-fd7cfe539ea0-0
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:07.892
I can't tell. Yeah, I think it's
gone into the boat. It looks

fd575f2e-4a03-41e4-a39c-fd7cfe539ea0-1
00:24:07.892 --> 00:24:09.320
like there's a.

962b4fd6-e996-4459-8643-80442e7273ca-0
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.040
Ohh gosh, a sea plant.

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-0
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:18.235
That has grown from the bottom.
All the other sea plants are

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-1
00:24:18.235 --> 00:24:22.712
short, relatively short. And
this sea plant has grown like it

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-2
00:24:22.712 --> 00:24:27.407
wants to attach itself into the
boat or go in there. And here we

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-3
00:24:27.407 --> 00:24:32.029
see rays. There's all sorts of
rays. Instead of fish, there's a

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-4
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:36.651
spotted ray and a bunch that are
Gray, and then there's a white

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-5
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:40.984
one, or the underside looks like
the underside of 1. It's a

7b1a0197-f69b-48da-bbfc-d3ebcef70ed0-6
00:24:40.984 --> 00:24:42.140
different color.

4fa057f5-8bda-4eb7-8f36-018769d1f554-0
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.830
OK, so now we see the boat.

04c15354-0084-4cfd-92a5-907071a94296-0
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.788
From the top and you don't see
under the water anymore and it's

04c15354-0084-4cfd-92a5-907071a94296-1
00:24:57.788 --> 00:24:58.580
approaching.

f72418b5-c4e6-44a2-8f33-ff5bcfcdbaed-0
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.566
Probably an island being that I
live in Florida, I'm going to

f72418b5-c4e6-44a2-8f33-ff5bcfcdbaed-1
00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:11.502
say it's mangroves because it
has those, those mangrove roots

f72418b5-c4e6-44a2-8f33-ff5bcfcdbaed-2
00:25:11.502 --> 00:25:16.358
at the bottom. And I would call
it a Rookery because here in

f72418b5-c4e6-44a2-8f33-ff5bcfcdbaed-3
00:25:16.358 --> 00:25:20.896
Florida we have all of these
places where the birds will

f72418b5-c4e6-44a2-8f33-ff5bcfcdbaed-4
00:25:20.896 --> 00:25:25.833
gather and that's where they
nest and sleep. And so this boat

f72418b5-c4e6-44a2-8f33-ff5bcfcdbaed-5
00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:30.609
is now approaching that and you
see some of the the plants.

d94a9ba0-c2c0-40c8-a893-eb5a86fddef1-0
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.234
The younger plants out by the
boat that almost look like

d94a9ba0-c2c0-40c8-a893-eb5a86fddef1-1
00:25:34.234 --> 00:25:38.277
flowers, but chances are really
good they'll just grow into more

d94a9ba0-c2c0-40c8-a893-eb5a86fddef1-2
00:25:38.277 --> 00:25:39.210
mangrove trees.

6698f4cc-46c4-4994-9431-6421225d966d-0
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.077
And now you have a cut out view
of what is under the water and

6698f4cc-46c4-4994-9431-6421225d966d-1
00:25:49.077 --> 00:25:54.313
what is above the water. And you
see the boat has gone into these

6698f4cc-46c4-4994-9431-6421225d966d-2
00:25:54.313 --> 00:25:59.469
mangrove plants that have these
amazing prop roots that actually

6698f4cc-46c4-4994-9431-6421225d966d-3
00:25:59.469 --> 00:26:04.070
have wildlife life in them. And
eventually they'll become

6698f4cc-46c4-4994-9431-6421225d966d-4
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:09.068
islands because everything will
collect around them. But right

6698f4cc-46c4-4994-9431-6421225d966d-5
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:13.590
now you see where the little
plants start at the bottom.

88f43db3-5b87-4186-bdbf-ac467c2ba866-0
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.953
And um, where they grow and you
see a swarm of fish on the right

88f43db3-5b87-4186-bdbf-ac467c2ba866-1
00:26:17.953 --> 00:26:21.854
hand side and you see different
fish further over to the right

88f43db3-5b87-4186-bdbf-ac467c2ba866-2
00:26:21.854 --> 00:26:25.568
that have like lights for eyes
and a lot of little fish and

88f43db3-5b87-4186-bdbf-ac467c2ba866-3
00:26:25.568 --> 00:26:29.344
birds still in the trees because
you're in the middle of the

88f43db3-5b87-4186-bdbf-ac467c2ba866-4
00:26:29.344 --> 00:26:29.840
Rookery.

c7816d39-a6fa-423c-a448-cefcefa2b91c-0
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.175
And so here we have the seahorse
in, still in the boat in the

c7816d39-a6fa-423c-a448-cefcefa2b91c-1
00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:42.338
middle of all of this, and some
of these are now now in the

c7816d39-a6fa-423c-a448-cefcefa2b91c-2
00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:47.846
plants areas you're going to see
animals, wildlife, and some of

c7816d39-a6fa-423c-a448-cefcefa2b91c-3
00:26:47.846 --> 00:26:53.181
them are pretty ugly looking.
There are birds up in the tree.

c7816d39-a6fa-423c-a448-cefcefa2b91c-4
00:26:53.181 --> 00:26:58.775
All these have lights for their
eyes, so they must be nocturnal.

c7816d39-a6fa-423c-a448-cefcefa2b91c-5
00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:02.390
You see crabs grow climbing up
the roots.

34d53d36-a3e4-4d43-9348-efff1c8523fe-0
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.810
Parrot type birds up in the tree
and then these creatures that.

aaaae54e-47f0-4e8e-8c3e-d97bbb7218a6-0
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.840
Are probably alligator like with
short legs and big pointed heads

aaaae54e-47f0-4e8e-8c3e-d97bbb7218a6-1
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.180
and teeth.

c7762546-57a5-4721-a35c-da754c744264-0
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:25.600


83511139-8d98-442e-bcb9-9333df51bf90-0
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.960
OK, I guess we're in two
pictures here.

5cc7e828-9967-40f1-bcc0-210587616c27-0
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.084
OK, on the left hand side, the
seahorse that's in the boat is

5cc7e828-9967-40f1-bcc0-210587616c27-1
00:27:37.084 --> 00:27:41.911
peering over into the water and
you, we can see under the water,

5cc7e828-9967-40f1-bcc0-210587616c27-2
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:46.070
but he's trying to see what's
under there and we see a.

71e9bac7-3bd8-4ab4-ab01-d119c56f0c20-0
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:56.570
Hmm, some sort of sea creature
riding on a lobster and then

b797d122-2a72-463c-a0de-dfcfab76c3f6-0
00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:01.414
There are still some other
pretty things under the water

b797d122-2a72-463c-a0de-dfcfab76c3f6-1
00:28:01.414 --> 00:28:04.110
and as you go to the right hand
side.

bfaf3822-c52c-472b-b935-5747c0426981-0
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:10.197
We see more things under the
water, but in between those prop

bfaf3822-c52c-472b-b935-5747c0426981-1
00:28:10.197 --> 00:28:14.728
roots now we see other sea
horses that look like the one

bfaf3822-c52c-472b-b935-5747c0426981-2
00:28:14.728 --> 00:28:19.656
that is in the boat and the one
in the boat is jumping out to

bfaf3822-c52c-472b-b935-5747c0426981-3
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:22.200
see those and his hat flies off.

f7254ac5-8b8a-424e-895b-43e4028c7a46-0
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:34.922
Now the boat has gone to a whole
other place and it looks like

f7254ac5-8b8a-424e-895b-43e4028c7a46-1
00:28:34.922 --> 00:28:40.614
it's an island from the top of
the water because there's birds

f7254ac5-8b8a-424e-895b-43e4028c7a46-2
00:28:40.614 --> 00:28:46.215
landing on it. But when you see
the cutaway view, you realize

f7254ac5-8b8a-424e-895b-43e4028c7a46-3
00:28:46.215 --> 00:28:51.907
it's really the top rounded part
of the head of this big whale

f7254ac5-8b8a-424e-895b-43e4028c7a46-4
00:28:51.907 --> 00:28:57.600
like creature. And then in the
next picture the boat has gone.

7020e3dc-2409-42ac-b14a-95d3309ad917-0
00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.250
Over.

fb1dd9c6-8e23-4299-8f32-b34ee3e52346-0
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:06.430
To a different creature that
still has that same kind of

fb1dd9c6-8e23-4299-8f32-b34ee3e52346-1
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.180
look, but it has

8838c92e-48e5-466f-afdc-92aeba3eed4b-0
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:15.559
Like front claws and is standing
on a wreck or a number of wrecks

8838c92e-48e5-466f-afdc-92aeba3eed4b-1
00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:20.714
from ships that have probably
formed a reef. And so he's

8838c92e-48e5-466f-afdc-92aeba3eed4b-2
00:29:20.714 --> 00:29:26.412
standing on that. He's got curly
cues all over his back and he

8838c92e-48e5-466f-afdc-92aeba3eed4b-3
00:29:26.412 --> 00:29:31.838
has teeth and his mouth is
facing the boat but doesn't look

8838c92e-48e5-466f-afdc-92aeba3eed4b-4
00:29:31.838 --> 00:29:34.100
like the boat can see it.

fc720eb2-6326-4a9a-a483-3e6fc7dad810-0
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:41.820
Well.

eb20d90d-0914-46f4-8b21-13d89ea8ad10-0
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.830
Um, it's sunset.

071fafda-2a53-4bb2-8ebd-d853d23cc16f-0
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:53.011
And all the other things are
coming out for the night time.

071fafda-2a53-4bb2-8ebd-d853d23cc16f-1
00:29:53.011 --> 00:29:57.887
And the boat is now in the
middle of still on top of the

071fafda-2a53-4bb2-8ebd-d853d23cc16f-2
00:29:57.887 --> 00:30:03.275
water, but everything else is
coming out from under the water.

071fafda-2a53-4bb2-8ebd-d853d23cc16f-3
00:30:03.275 --> 00:30:08.835
And there's all kinds of things,
including a dog and a cat and a

071fafda-2a53-4bb2-8ebd-d853d23cc16f-4
00:30:08.835 --> 00:30:14.395
leopard and all kinds of things.
So, you know, this could really

071fafda-2a53-4bb2-8ebd-d853d23cc16f-5
00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:17.560
be a crazy dream. And there's
birds.

076323f3-578e-44ed-8ec4-4f815f4f5589-0
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.345
Turning into butterflies up in
the air and it looks like a moon

076323f3-578e-44ed-8ec4-4f815f4f5589-1
00:30:22.345 --> 00:30:26.535
with a bat flying in front of
it, but it also looks like

076323f3-578e-44ed-8ec4-4f815f4f5589-2
00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:31.020
there's some fish tails around
it, so I don't know if it's a

076323f3-578e-44ed-8ec4-4f815f4f5589-3
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:35.431
blower fish that's floating in
the air or it's a moon. Very

076323f3-578e-44ed-8ec4-4f815f4f5589-4
00:30:35.431 --> 00:30:39.842
interesting picture, all sorts
of creatures that don't look

076323f3-578e-44ed-8ec4-4f815f4f5589-5
00:30:39.842 --> 00:30:44.179
like they're in the right place,
elephants and everything.

bcc5f2b8-1c3c-494b-866a-6b9415c6750c-0
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.650
Ah.

85a06fe0-4f51-4348-b619-5a91f0061789-0
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.240
Much better.

048a248a-af30-4cb7-9865-e5cf8017e04e-0
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.320
So now we have the dark of
night.

572c7f4a-601c-4050-a59f-e1a6c6f8c9a8-0
00:30:54.090 --> 00:31:00.320
And you can see like a Milky Way
Galaxy in the sky.

796a2c81-5365-454b-ba5a-4d4bf9e95ab1-0
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:06.495
Um, but everything else is stars
in the sky and a Crescent moon

796a2c81-5365-454b-ba5a-4d4bf9e95ab1-1
00:31:06.495 --> 00:31:11.348
and the white boat floating on
the water with all sorts of

796a2c81-5365-454b-ba5a-4d4bf9e95ab1-2
00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:11.760
eyes.

cc1c8509-42f1-4630-80d0-fd3e48dfe4eb-0
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.546
On the creatures under the
water, that really just kind of

cc1c8509-42f1-4630-80d0-fd3e48dfe4eb-1
00:31:17.546 --> 00:31:22.349
looked like shadows of fish, but
they're all very interested in

cc1c8509-42f1-4630-80d0-fd3e48dfe4eb-2
00:31:22.349 --> 00:31:24.450
the boat and approaching it.

36088435-beef-4f6b-84d4-24f49786a8e5-0
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.771
Yes, yes, they were approaching
it, and so now they're all

36088435-beef-4f6b-84d4-24f49786a8e5-1
00:31:33.771 --> 00:31:37.930
coming out of the water with the
lights on their eyes.

bff5c2aa-751c-47b6-9a90-69e23828a2fc-0
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.263
The boat in the dark is
surrounded by all these fish,

bff5c2aa-751c-47b6-9a90-69e23828a2fc-1
00:31:43.263 --> 00:31:46.840
like standing on their tails
looking at the boat.

858de4d4-77ff-4e19-bfd5-d06933d643ba-0
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.870
Oh, oh, oh.

9dbb48a8-1232-431f-9e4c-785d58f30b3d-0
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.920
I love this, yes.

0f9c932b-60c7-4293-941f-53a5af1e0cd7-0
00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:02.398
This I wish I would really see
this. It looks like they have

0f9c932b-60c7-4293-941f-53a5af1e0cd7-1
00:32:02.398 --> 00:32:08.108
there's a name for it like it
looks like that I think somebody

0f9c932b-60c7-4293-941f-53a5af1e0cd7-2
00:32:08.108 --> 00:32:13.909
has referred to it as like the
hem of angels garments that come

0f9c932b-60c7-4293-941f-53a5af1e0cd7-3
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:19.529
in light forms out of the sky.
It's a, it's a light and cloud

0f9c932b-60c7-4293-941f-53a5af1e0cd7-4
00:32:19.529 --> 00:32:24.786
formation coming out of this
starry night sky and you see

0f9c932b-60c7-4293-941f-53a5af1e0cd7-5
00:32:24.786 --> 00:32:26.780
that most of the fish.

df2be803-748a-4146-9e6c-9ad2fd9df14b-0
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:31.452
Are not there anymore, but the
boat is still there on this

df2be803-748a-4146-9e6c-9ad2fd9df14b-1
00:32:31.452 --> 00:32:36.500
expansive water with the starry
night above it and this gorgeous

df2be803-748a-4146-9e6c-9ad2fd9df14b-2
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.829
light formation up in the sky.

29f4cdf1-a8d2-42b7-9173-3f2904e60142-0
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.100
Now.

3e4710c1-1942-4620-a780-99e5a677c623-0
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:53.082
It's still night time and the
boat has gone further and it

3e4710c1-1942-4620-a780-99e5a677c623-1
00:32:53.082 --> 00:32:58.627
looks like it's approaching a
huge iceberg, big white iceberg,

3e4710c1-1942-4620-a780-99e5a677c623-2
00:32:58.627 --> 00:33:03.996
so high and the next picture
looks like there's a place that

3e4710c1-1942-4620-a780-99e5a677c623-3
00:33:03.996 --> 00:33:09.452
that it can go through a hole in
the iceberg on the left hand

3e4710c1-1942-4620-a780-99e5a677c623-4
00:33:09.452 --> 00:33:14.909
side as as it approaches this
hole there are floating pieces,

3e4710c1-1942-4620-a780-99e5a677c623-5
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:18.430
smaller pieces of ice all in the
water.

da187172-2f28-41fc-ad9b-cde5a4222cb3-0
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:25.830
And as he goes through this
archway, it looks like trees.

d92cd630-06c2-461a-b762-8a0fe0a26930-0
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:33.854
Fur trees with snow on them in
the distance and then in the

d92cd630-06c2-461a-b762-8a0fe0a26930-1
00:33:33.854 --> 00:33:40.549
next picture on the right you
see that this is like a cavern

d92cd630-06c2-461a-b762-8a0fe0a26930-2
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:47.573
in the iceberg that has a lot of
pathways and the boat is going

d92cd630-06c2-461a-b762-8a0fe0a26930-3
00:33:47.573 --> 00:33:49.000
through them.

04b26e97-6356-442d-89aa-ac927836ca65-0
00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:02.107
OK. And so now we're coming out
on the other side of the iceberg

04b26e97-6356-442d-89aa-ac927836ca65-1
00:34:02.107 --> 00:34:06.905
or what appears as an iceberg
and the little boat is coming

04b26e97-6356-442d-89aa-ac927836ca65-2
00:34:06.905 --> 00:34:11.943
out and there's something that
is shining on it that is coming

04b26e97-6356-442d-89aa-ac927836ca65-3
00:34:11.943 --> 00:34:16.740
up out of the water like a lamp
on a curved pole and on the

04b26e97-6356-442d-89aa-ac927836ca65-4
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.900
right hand picture you see.

4d5e4a08-7673-4764-ad5a-11f66a52ba0e-0
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:26.975
I want to say it's a man, but I
doubt if it is. It's a man like

4d5e4a08-7673-4764-ad5a-11f66a52ba0e-1
00:34:26.975 --> 00:34:32.260
like figure with arms and a body
and a head that has one of those

4d5e4a08-7673-4764-ad5a-11f66a52ba0e-2
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:36.905
divers helmets on it and the
light is he is picked up the

4d5e4a08-7673-4764-ad5a-11f66a52ba0e-3
00:34:36.905 --> 00:34:41.470
boat and the light is now
shining on the boat. But there

4d5e4a08-7673-4764-ad5a-11f66a52ba0e-4
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:46.355
are lights from various places
on these curvy poles that are

4d5e4a08-7673-4764-ad5a-11f66a52ba0e-5
00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:50.600
flexible and they can move to
shine in various ways.

89f693b6-3f3a-4809-a843-6989090d976c-0
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.943
Looks like another one might be
coming out of the water, because

89f693b6-3f3a-4809-a843-6989090d976c-1
00:34:56.943 --> 00:35:01.902
the one on the one that's
holding the boat has a number 08

89f693b6-3f3a-4809-a843-6989090d976c-2
00:35:01.902 --> 00:35:07.029
on his head and the other one
has a 05, but their hands look

89f693b6-3f3a-4809-a843-6989090d976c-3
00:35:07.029 --> 00:35:08.290
like fishtails.

fe550afb-d3b3-4603-961f-6313a0ff9868-0
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.030
But it does have an oxygen tank.

a8762bb7-c70e-49bd-a8fd-0580d1959a27-0
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:21.728
OK, now we're finally on the
next picture, seeing the little

a8762bb7-c70e-49bd-a8fd-0580d1959a27-1
00:35:21.728 --> 00:35:27.461
boat still back in the water and
and yet one of those curvy

a8762bb7-c70e-49bd-a8fd-0580d1959a27-2
00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:33.194
lights is still next to it and
it's turned and shining on a

a8762bb7-c70e-49bd-a8fd-0580d1959a27-3
00:35:33.194 --> 00:35:38.832
huge ship. And there's white
birds again, there's two huge

a8762bb7-c70e-49bd-a8fd-0580d1959a27-4
00:35:38.832 --> 00:35:44.947
ships. And so the little boat is
approaching that and this ship

a8762bb7-c70e-49bd-a8fd-0580d1959a27-5
00:35:44.947 --> 00:35:45.330
has.

a1a4e72d-4563-4773-b524-2f63e8246bad-0
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.530
Uh, cargo Nets hanging from it.

a893e677-cbc1-4aaa-aea0-513d89d4acbe-0
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:54.708
Um, one of them has a fishtail
hanging out of it. One of them

a893e677-cbc1-4aaa-aea0-513d89d4acbe-1
00:35:54.708 --> 00:35:59.480
has a lot of little fish, some
which are spilling out.

eaaed821-37d1-41b4-b04d-40853516aa21-0
00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.900
And um.

f91721d2-1c87-4065-ae4d-252849271f09-0
00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:03.960
Uh, it

a299faaa-2c7e-45bf-bb2d-a487c4413604-0
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:09.480
The the bone in the background
has um

f1191a26-e314-438d-88aa-7087f01d63bf-0
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.510
Big

52c1b5cb-a598-436c-aeb5-f1e34b8fe3a9-0
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.861
Smokestacks and so it looks like
there's just a lot of smoke in

52c1b5cb-a598-436c-aeb5-f1e34b8fe3a9-1
00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:22.952
the air, but it's on the other
side of the big boat too, so I'm

52c1b5cb-a598-436c-aeb5-f1e34b8fe3a9-2
00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:26.340
not sure if it's going to turn
out to be just smoke.

2f14bf5a-6653-4905-8a32-ae6acdfdd293-0
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:36.117
And it wasn't. Oh, here we go.
The boat is now on the left hand

2f14bf5a-6653-4905-8a32-ae6acdfdd293-1
00:36:36.117 --> 00:36:42.082
side of the page in a dark space
like where all of that smoky

2f14bf5a-6653-4905-8a32-ae6acdfdd293-2
00:36:42.082 --> 00:36:47.470
stuff came. It looks like it's
now a forested area and.

f4414afa-e76b-4bf4-8a13-63d16f1099aa-0
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.514
Um, the white birds are
everywhere. Some of them have

f4414afa-e76b-4bf4-8a13-63d16f1099aa-1
00:36:53.514 --> 00:36:57.840
are heading toward the boat, one
of them is in the boat. Some of

f4414afa-e76b-4bf4-8a13-63d16f1099aa-2
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.100
them are diving into the water
and then in the next page on the

f4414afa-e76b-4bf4-8a13-63d16f1099aa-3
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.500
right.

bf4cfc2d-c35e-47a8-99a6-dbc88413603f-0
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:04.380
Umm.

27f1a69f-4134-468b-b327-a6f57078ae9c-0
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.490
You see that

5b45a8ce-c040-48da-b5ab-32334cdd34f3-0
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.680
I guess.

fa2dd9df-39d2-4c74-ab55-5befab18c2fe-0
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.978
It doesn't, it looks like a
landing spot. It looks like. Ohh

fa2dd9df-39d2-4c74-ab55-5befab18c2fe-1
00:37:16.978 --> 00:37:18.970
what would you call it like?

fcd25893-4226-4ff4-8615-d384366aaf27-0
00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.569
On big pillars where they would
take care of emptying things off

fcd25893-4226-4ff4-8615-d384366aaf27-1
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:31.638
the boat, there's cranes on the
left hand side that have a big

fcd25893-4226-4ff4-8615-d384366aaf27-2
00:37:31.638 --> 00:37:36.707
fish on. It looks like they're
ready to pick up some cargo. It

fcd25893-4226-4ff4-8615-d384366aaf27-3
00:37:36.707 --> 00:37:41.614
has smokestacks and looks like a
place where it will produce

fcd25893-4226-4ff4-8615-d384366aaf27-4
00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:46.844
things. You still see all of the
birds flying and going into the

fcd25893-4226-4ff4-8615-d384366aaf27-5
00:37:46.844 --> 00:37:51.350
water, but you don't see the
little white boat anymore.

a90c7231-a4a2-465e-b428-3ba8a98bec32-0
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.648
No. Now we see the little boat,
and there are creatures from

a90c7231-a4a2-465e-b428-3ba8a98bec32-1
00:38:02.648 --> 00:38:03.000
this

c74e2f69-074c-482e-b79f-448f96e0a4a0-0
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.370
This

f0b7dd6f-ae8a-4345-bbde-4e8c8401df6f-0
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.471
production area coming out of
windows and one of the big

f0b7dd6f-ae8a-4345-bbde-4e8c8401df6f-1
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:15.700
pilings and shooting

f1a9271e-edf6-453a-b336-3afcc4399cc5-0
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.480
Something shooting

b8a339c5-12e4-4791-839c-50513eee7de9-0
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.994
At the boat and anything else in
the water, which includes those

b8a339c5-12e4-4791-839c-50513eee7de9-1
00:38:24.994 --> 00:38:30.552
diver people and there is a huge
claw on a chain coming down like

b8a339c5-12e4-4791-839c-50513eee7de9-2
00:38:30.552 --> 00:38:34.090
it's going to grab them and pick
them up.

9290517c-ed5c-4cd0-94bc-9032cbae3498-0
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.860
Um, on the right hand side.

85d4f918-578c-42f0-abf0-1691d53a0785-0
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:44.903
You see the boat again and it
now has a life preserver thrown

85d4f918-578c-42f0-abf0-1691d53a0785-1
00:38:44.903 --> 00:38:48.440
into it by one of those diver
men.

8557ba5e-3298-494f-83c7-2617fa2560c1-0
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.158
Well, this is, this is real,
really a diver man. It has

8557ba5e-3298-494f-83c7-2617fa2560c1-1
00:38:53.158 --> 00:38:55.840
hands. It's not like the other
ones.

51547acb-ec92-4595-97ff-a2dae1edf889-0
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.170
And it's coming out

c3772508-1345-4263-a291-64ad5247cee7-0
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.013
On top of what I guess would
best be described as a rocket

c3772508-1345-4263-a291-64ad5247cee7-1
00:39:06.013 --> 00:39:11.575
looking submarine and apparently
he he wants to jump into the

c3772508-1345-4263-a291-64ad5247cee7-2
00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:16.510
boat through the life preserver
over there. We'll see.

5601e1e2-060a-4c52-958f-013a92f102fc-0
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:26.029
Yes. So now this looks like
almost a combination scene, but

5601e1e2-060a-4c52-958f-013a92f102fc-1
00:39:26.029 --> 00:39:32.460
you've got the you have the
diver holding on to the rope

5c6ecf61-2809-42ab-a549-2b85cbfe1732-0
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:38.633
That he has attached to the boat
by that life preserver. And the

5c6ecf61-2809-42ab-a549-2b85cbfe1732-1
00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:43.284
boat is the little little boat,
little white boat is going

5c6ecf61-2809-42ab-a549-2b85cbfe1732-2
00:39:43.284 --> 00:39:46.910
through very big waves and it is
approaching.

2a431423-7264-4e76-a51f-880d9fbc5346-0
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.640
Another boat that is made out of
a Nautilus shell.

651677d6-b9cc-434d-9108-25b8bbdba366-0
00:39:54.290 --> 00:40:02.950
And has a kite for a sail and a
tall mast, and here we have that

2ca7cee7-fec1-4e5e-83ea-11b7e50bb73a-0
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:10.779
First character that we saw in
the costume with the Horn on his

2ca7cee7-fec1-4e5e-83ea-11b7e50bb73a-1
00:40:10.779 --> 00:40:17.449
head up in the Crows Nest area
of the mast with all these other

2ca7cee7-fec1-4e5e-83ea-11b7e50bb73a-2
00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:18.700
creatures of

41ff7b8b-b5f6-4f90-ac2f-0eb44abee0ca-0
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.590
All kinds.

3874e2b2-2946-436c-9e4a-5d417cfc9741-0
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:27.135
In the boat with him, including
a horse, and like a reindeer and

3874e2b2-2946-436c-9e4a-5d417cfc9741-1
00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:29.300
little things and a cat and.

ea419356-9a44-476b-8b5e-f8ec6ca36fd3-0
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.460
A big conglomeration of strange
looking animals.

64132bd0-7801-42a1-9434-05ed37f85c84-0
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.780
So as we look at this, a

bc589f95-0959-4318-97c2-3140ea16d32a-0
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:53.555
you see that our little boat now
looks farther away from this

bc589f95-0959-4318-97c2-3140ea16d32a-1
00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:54.920
Nautilus ship.

83b8d9ee-2956-40ec-a8d1-d67112fc9b68-0
00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:01.945
And because a big big huge wave
has come up and it is now caught

83b8d9ee-2956-40ec-a8d1-d67112fc9b68-1
00:41:01.945 --> 00:41:07.510
in the Crest of the wave and is
actually pointing upward.

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-0
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:13.819
caught in the Crest of the wave
on the right hand side of the

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-1
00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:18.980
page you see that the Nautilus
boat now has a hole in the kite

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-2
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.978
sail and there are two little
creatures in it. It looks like

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-3
00:41:23.978 --> 00:41:28.975
they're just looking over, but
they could be jumping and all

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-4
00:41:28.975 --> 00:41:34.218
the other animals are looking to
see what is going on. And down

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-5
00:41:34.218 --> 00:41:39.134
at the bottom you have that
diver man in that boat now with

959e29c3-fe0a-4a03-957b-27d78a00bc64-6
00:41:39.134 --> 00:41:39.380
the

ced17883-ab9c-4acf-b845-e77f2a25804e-0
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:44.550
Horned costumed creature man up
at the top with a huge paper

ced17883-ab9c-4acf-b845-e77f2a25804e-1
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:49.984
airplane. Huge. Much bigger than
he is. Pointed in the direction

ced17883-ab9c-4acf-b845-e77f2a25804e-2
00:41:49.984 --> 00:41:54.750
of the boat, like he's going to
do something to save it.

665c1123-81a7-4c96-a91c-6e69e0cbb511-0
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:08.850
So on the left hand side you see
big Lightning coming through.

b1951a6f-de48-46b6-bb70-96e438e767f4-0
00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.222
I guess its a space in in the
trees or big dark clouds um and

b1951a6f-de48-46b6-bb70-96e438e767f4-1
00:42:13.222 --> 00:42:16.471
hitting the water but the little
boat is now just floating on the

b1951a6f-de48-46b6-bb70-96e438e767f4-2
00:42:16.471 --> 00:42:19.523
top of the water again and then
on the right hand side of the

b1951a6f-de48-46b6-bb70-96e438e767f4-3
00:42:19.523 --> 00:42:20.410
page you see this.

9471f32e-ae31-4d77-8725-f2f4b1c83436-0
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:27.024
White paper airplane making its
way streaking through the

9471f32e-ae31-4d77-8725-f2f4b1c83436-1
00:42:27.024 --> 00:42:29.380
darkness above the water.

3321ae1c-b902-453d-95e2-68e648a19702-0
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.760
So now the boat has approached
this place that looks like.

ca7fa6e5-3e80-4353-852e-d3b55f895d4d-0
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:51.903
Well, seriously, it looks like a
bunch of Donuts standing on end,

ca7fa6e5-3e80-4353-852e-d3b55f895d4d-1
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:56.580
but it's supposed to represent
miles and miles of

8ce3015b-f171-470c-81ce-b37b1fe8168e-0
00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:02.944
A long tail of these sea
serpents. And so I think I only

8ce3015b-f171-470c-81ce-b37b1fe8168e-1
00:43:02.944 --> 00:43:08.838
see one sea serpent head, but
the possibility of others in

8ce3015b-f171-470c-81ce-b37b1fe8168e-2
00:43:08.838 --> 00:43:14.833
various places. So it could be
more than one or it could be

8ce3015b-f171-470c-81ce-b37b1fe8168e-3
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:20.727
just one humongous one. And at
the top on the top of this,

8ce3015b-f171-470c-81ce-b37b1fe8168e-4
00:43:20.727 --> 00:43:26.821
where 1 sea serpent is coming
out and curling himself up, he

8ce3015b-f171-470c-81ce-b37b1fe8168e-5
00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:28.419
caught the paper

80a5528d-5379-47ed-9d48-c6c22d91debb-0
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.210
airplane

54b5ccf6-5747-47fc-9ac3-5b394cc7a11f-0
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.530
in his mouth

dfb332b7-0017-4e78-b64c-913c6ce2bb9b-0
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.990
Oh, now.

09641411-6f9a-4279-8101-c958ba0df912-0
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.210
On the left hand side you see
underneath all of that and you

09641411-6f9a-4279-8101-c958ba0df912-1
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.650
see the head of the.

0be3887b-5399-4648-8fb0-e496976282fe-0
00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:51.396
The head and neck of that sea
serpent and I I don't really see

0be3887b-5399-4648-8fb0-e496976282fe-1
00:43:51.396 --> 00:43:56.214
anything else. He's just looking
down. I don't see the paper

0be3887b-5399-4648-8fb0-e496976282fe-2
00:43:56.214 --> 00:44:00.875
airplane anymore. And then on
the next picture you see the

0be3887b-5399-4648-8fb0-e496976282fe-3
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:05.535
boat going through all the
channels formed by the archways

0be3887b-5399-4648-8fb0-e496976282fe-4
00:44:05.535 --> 00:44:10.353
of the sea serpent tail and two
other creatures that are not

0be3887b-5399-4648-8fb0-e496976282fe-5
00:44:10.353 --> 00:44:15.330
like the sea serpent are making
appearances in the background.

063f34d4-dda7-47e2-af7a-623779668773-0
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:22.046
One of them, and and he's right
here on the next picture, one of

063f34d4-dda7-47e2-af7a-623779668773-1
00:44:22.046 --> 00:44:22.700
them has.

c7f5a33d-a8fb-48b1-9ae2-b08161b4c08b-0
00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:29.653
Has a horn on the front of his
head like a narwhal, and so I

c7f5a33d-a8fb-48b1-9ae2-b08161b4c08b-1
00:44:29.653 --> 00:44:34.170
would guess that's what that is
now that you see him up close

c7f5a33d-a8fb-48b1-9ae2-b08161b4c08b-2
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.700
and the other one has

6e445f2f-5aac-4fe0-b958-aff9e3ff6c9e-0
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:43.893
Like a sawtooth, like a a a
sawfish wood. But it doesn't.

6e445f2f-5aac-4fe0-b958-aff9e3ff6c9e-1
00:44:43.893 --> 00:44:49.360
He's not shaped like a fish.
He's shaped like an elephant, as

6e445f2f-5aac-4fe0-b958-aff9e3ff6c9e-2
00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.210
far as his head and his snout,
and they're approaching

1bc2b664-a734-4e8f-84f5-73f14e9815d1-0
00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.313
Uh, they see the little boat and
they're pouring water into the

1bc2b664-a734-4e8f-84f5-73f14e9815d1-1
00:45:00.313 --> 00:45:05.344
little boat. The narwhal is from
his nostrils. And as they as

1bc2b664-a734-4e8f-84f5-73f14e9815d1-2
00:45:05.344 --> 00:45:10.618
they're doing that, the boat is
looks like it's trying. Yeah. In

1bc2b664-a734-4e8f-84f5-73f14e9815d1-3
00:45:10.618 --> 00:45:15.730
the next picture you see that
the boat is approaching a what I

1bc2b664-a734-4e8f-84f5-73f14e9815d1-4
00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.949
would call a desert island where
other things have.

9836edb8-372a-4f15-bd28-81b34c1e8b18-0
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:27.893
Crashed or been and left trash
and standing on that is a fish

9836edb8-372a-4f15-bd28-81b34c1e8b18-1
00:45:27.893 --> 00:45:34.470
man, spotted fish man with long
fins and a bathing suit.

d368800a-0536-43d5-8cb2-3d5ac3562a86-0
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:38.850
Ohh.

7ef9b562-7aaf-4026-8440-6b7dc0b1683d-0
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:45.131
And now we're underwater with
sea anemones and jellyfish and

7ef9b562-7aaf-4026-8440-6b7dc0b1683d-1
00:45:45.131 --> 00:45:50.266
beautiful things still all in
black and white. And the boat is

7ef9b562-7aaf-4026-8440-6b7dc0b1683d-2
00:45:50.266 --> 00:45:55.400
underneath the water, swimming
through those, floating through

7ef9b562-7aaf-4026-8440-6b7dc0b1683d-3
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:55.889
those.

bfb88104-6580-46ad-993c-f3d78a19f94f-0
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:04.319
So apparently the boat is now
underwater and on the left side

bfb88104-6580-46ad-993c-f3d78a19f94f-1
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:08.900
is passing, passing a school of
fish with those lights for eyes.

bfb88104-6580-46ad-993c-f3d78a19f94f-2
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:13.482
There's a couple of small things
down underneath them. One looks

bfb88104-6580-46ad-993c-f3d78a19f94f-3
00:46:13.482 --> 00:46:17.851
like a watermelon and then on
the right hand side you see the

bfb88104-6580-46ad-993c-f3d78a19f94f-4
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:19.050
boat looks like a

bfe23efa-a32f-48f5-b050-1fd7ff3b3934-0
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.040
Big um

0b889a4d-f8b6-4b1b-aa26-4b7042715967-0
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.640
Ohh, I don't know. Big Sea
creature is approaching the boat

0b889a4d-f8b6-4b1b-aa26-4b7042715967-1
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.869
and everything else like those
little watermelon things with

0b889a4d-f8b6-4b1b-aa26-4b7042715967-2
00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:34.613
tails are swimming around it.
Everything's dark. It's

0b889a4d-f8b6-4b1b-aa26-4b7042715967-3
00:46:34.613 --> 00:46:36.070
underneath the water.

0988431e-72d0-4671-8fc7-7490b7edf8a9-0
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:43.037
Well, now everything's not dark
anymore. So on the on the left

0988431e-72d0-4671-8fc7-7490b7edf8a9-1
00:46:43.037 --> 00:46:48.255
hand side you see that our
little boat has landed like on

0988431e-72d0-4671-8fc7-7490b7edf8a9-2
00:46:48.255 --> 00:46:53.474
the bottom of this body of
water, and three little crabby

0988431e-72d0-4671-8fc7-7490b7edf8a9-3
00:46:53.474 --> 00:46:58.962
looking creatures are crawling
all over it and there's a big

0988431e-72d0-4671-8fc7-7490b7edf8a9-4
00:46:58.962 --> 00:47:04.360
spotlight shining on it from the
top down on the next page.

f10d4d22-7267-4e73-bafa-d5787b8ab0f6-0
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.470
It appears

67816ecb-60d3-4a2d-8a89-dd21cf7cc0f8-0
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:15.463
That, um, things have shifted a
little and we see that that

67816ecb-60d3-4a2d-8a89-dd21cf7cc0f8-1
00:47:15.463 --> 00:47:17.270
light comes from

d6987107-5c0c-4057-b6ce-7d42b377d008-0
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:19.670
A submarine.

dfe5fa00-d071-488b-8b73-08bb1f61032c-0
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.990
And the submarine is near this
huge

ecb55bbb-9b42-4383-9b98-3763dc16fa3f-0
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:32.904
I think it's an eel. I'm trying
to think of what it's got. Yeah,

ecb55bbb-9b42-4383-9b98-3763dc16fa3f-1
00:47:32.904 --> 00:47:37.773
it's a yeah, it's a a Moray eel.
And then there's all these

ecb55bbb-9b42-4383-9b98-3763dc16fa3f-2
00:47:37.773 --> 00:47:39.640
little Firefly looking.

19b4cac4-afae-481b-a630-955be4d3db08-0
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.309
I'm going to call them
creatures. They're probably

19b4cac4-afae-481b-a630-955be4d3db08-1
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:47.813
fish. They could be men because
they have lights coming from

19b4cac4-afae-481b-a630-955be4d3db08-2
00:47:47.813 --> 00:47:51.490
them and so it's a little hard
to tell right now, but the boat.

9f394c58-07d5-4313-ae35-04e9382b18ea-0
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.380
The little boat is

0c9f4aa8-78d1-4b12-a070-1505754bf508-0
00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.495
Is on the front part of that
submarine, like the submarine

0c9f4aa8-78d1-4b12-a070-1505754bf508-1
00:48:01.495 --> 00:48:03.500
went and picked it up.

85d0b080-e7cc-4af8-80f7-f2be83bf8c5e-0
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.910
And apparently it has so on the

4c2dc85e-e263-4987-b563-5aa60fde28a0-0
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.914
Left hand side, you see the
submarine coming out of the

4c2dc85e-e263-4987-b563-5aa60fde28a0-1
00:48:16.914 --> 00:48:22.073
water with the boat on its tip
front tip and all the water that

4c2dc85e-e263-4987-b563-5aa60fde28a0-2
00:48:22.073 --> 00:48:27.072
was caught in the boat is now
spilling out of it. So it looks

4c2dc85e-e263-4987-b563-5aa60fde28a0-3
00:48:27.072 --> 00:48:32.070
like it'll be dry and able to
float again and there's a bunch

4c2dc85e-e263-4987-b563-5aa60fde28a0-4
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.940
of fish underneath then on the
right hand side.

19d80c4d-a9ab-4a4a-a1a0-46cd1dbb2c65-0
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.830
You see the boat floating just
fine. And some other.

7c176127-5a5c-480d-be8f-4c0f997fcacf-0
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.250
A small ship

5ee197ca-262e-4e5c-ae58-533557727369-0
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:52.983
And there's white birds there
now. A small ship is being

5ee197ca-262e-4e5c-ae58-533557727369-1
00:48:52.983 --> 00:48:55.510
attacked by this huge squid

1fbe74cc-f533-4d6e-9f80-bac79ec49520-0
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.900
Near the boat.

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-0
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:07.299
And now on the left hand side we
have a bunch of sea lions

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-1
00:49:07.299 --> 00:49:11.744
playing with the boat, turning
it on end and you can see them

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-2
00:49:11.744 --> 00:49:16.046
underneath the water. And above
the water we have a cutaway

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-3
00:49:16.046 --> 00:49:20.491
version. And then on the right
hand side, I think this is all

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-4
00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:25.151
one picture, it's hard to tell.
On the right hand side there's a

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-5
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:29.309
lot of sea ferns and still
another sea lion and some fish

5c6deca0-c197-4966-bd55-00f0bc175317-6
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:30.600
and more activity.

fd84b39c-5a94-42a8-9c9d-e2b4e7de5ed6-0
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.580
Under the water.

6b41ebac-177b-4b0b-bcc2-e6bf9e5d2928-0
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.930
And now we see under the water.

638468cc-671e-4faa-bd32-ee11f4ed4c3b-0
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:46.110
On the left hand side there are
more sea creatures.

9551ceb3-b1d7-45d9-b3bd-b010c5b4efdb-0
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:54.074
Big beautiful fish or some
coral, lots of those sea ferns

9551ceb3-b1d7-45d9-b3bd-b010c5b4efdb-1
00:49:54.074 --> 00:50:01.195
and like Manowar and then on the
right hand side the boat keeps

9551ceb3-b1d7-45d9-b3bd-b010c5b4efdb-2
00:50:01.195 --> 00:50:08.094
going and you see that there is
some sort of wreck down there

9551ceb3-b1d7-45d9-b3bd-b010c5b4efdb-3
00:50:08.094 --> 00:50:08.540
and.

6c7d5bbd-dc4f-41c5-baa4-90826515984e-0
00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:15.586
And it looks like a recovery
effort. There's a long

6c7d5bbd-dc4f-41c5-baa4-90826515984e-1
00:50:15.586 --> 00:50:16.720
extension.

3e1f8d88-8582-4a5a-8cc9-22a8bdf73e14-0
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:24.271
Of some sort. Like it would be
collecting things from this,

3e1f8d88-8582-4a5a-8cc9-22a8bdf73e14-1
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:29.081
from this boat. And there is a
diver down there, a man looking

3e1f8d88-8582-4a5a-8cc9-22a8bdf73e14-2
00:50:29.081 --> 00:50:29.539
diver.

743c23f3-ee80-4cc2-94f4-1424f15a8549-0
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.310
Ah, so now.

94ffae18-0f3b-43a5-ae9b-9a56c37f49ea-0
00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:45.786
On the left hand side you see
the boat on the top of the water

94ffae18-0f3b-43a5-ae9b-9a56c37f49ea-1
00:50:45.786 --> 00:50:50.515
and on the top of the water
there's a buoy. And there are

94ffae18-0f3b-43a5-ae9b-9a56c37f49ea-2
00:50:50.515 --> 00:50:55.406
some crazy looking creatures
climbing the buoy, but there's

94ffae18-0f3b-43a5-ae9b-9a56c37f49ea-3
00:50:55.406 --> 00:51:00.543
one that is a man's man diver
and one that is not a man diver,

94ffae18-0f3b-43a5-ae9b-9a56c37f49ea-4
00:51:00.543 --> 00:51:05.516
it's some other sort of creature
that looks like it has been

94ffae18-0f3b-43a5-ae9b-9a56c37f49ea-5
00:51:05.516 --> 00:51:08.369
diving and they are on the back
of

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-0
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:15.547
Another fish type thing or sea
serpent type thing that is looks

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-1
00:51:15.547 --> 00:51:20.044
like it's brought them to the
buoy and the boat is watching

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-2
00:51:20.044 --> 00:51:24.242
this happen. Then in the right
hand picture the boat is

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-3
00:51:24.242 --> 00:51:28.815
approaching a lighthouse on a
small island or a big rock and

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-4
00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:33.462
it looks like there's someone
coming down from the lighthouse

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-5
00:51:33.462 --> 00:51:37.585
to see the boat and there are a
couple of ships in the

142f19b2-9ab1-4d26-be69-49fe57fd22ff-6
00:51:37.585 --> 00:51:38.410
background.

f6b5d344-f017-44d2-84fa-051ac95bcc16-0
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:42.980
Yeah.

2ce0d8ad-fadd-4685-9ae6-b152bceecba7-0
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.950
This is a cutaway version.

3a01b56e-553f-446b-8d05-07be367e678d-0
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.650
And um.

830e5fbc-8416-41a0-a46e-2a68abb8dbf8-0
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:57.248
I don't see the lighthouse
anymore, so I guess that was as

830e5fbc-8416-41a0-a46e-2a68abb8dbf8-1
00:51:57.248 --> 00:52:02.354
it was approaching the harbor
because there's still other big

830e5fbc-8416-41a0-a46e-2a68abb8dbf8-2
00:52:02.354 --> 00:52:07.212
boats around and we see a
cutaway of this huge bridge that

830e5fbc-8416-41a0-a46e-2a68abb8dbf8-3
00:52:07.212 --> 00:52:07.460
is.

bb2805c5-77e9-4346-8ec0-45d3a4b0a375-0
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:14.046
Built out of like steel rafters
and it goes down underneath the

bb2805c5-77e9-4346-8ec0-45d3a4b0a375-1
00:52:14.046 --> 00:52:18.618
water. You can see all the steel
girders and you can see the

bb2805c5-77e9-4346-8ec0-45d3a4b0a375-2
00:52:18.618 --> 00:52:23.265
little boat in front and there's
other boats, you can see the

bb2805c5-77e9-4346-8ec0-45d3a4b0a375-3
00:52:23.265 --> 00:52:27.987
bottoms of them and there's not
much sea life you see, but you

bb2805c5-77e9-4346-8ec0-45d3a4b0a375-4
00:52:27.987 --> 00:52:31.510
see the ferns and some fish and
then up above.

0d42e673-269c-4491-b09b-c78946893012-0
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.480
On the end of this

63ff6ae9-a144-4aa4-8332-bbd6b6af9b4b-0
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.890
Bridge, there's a round

55ad436a-501f-4351-bf2d-7d64d0e3e231-0
00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:43.849
Building that looks like it
would be an observatory because

55ad436a-501f-4351-bf2d-7d64d0e3e231-1
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:48.388
it has like lampposts around it
and people inside of it and

55ad436a-501f-4351-bf2d-7d64d0e3e231-2
00:52:48.388 --> 00:52:52.020
looks like glass that they'd be
looking out of.

bd6502ad-12a2-4b11-bbda-63868f745971-0
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.067
And now this is a double page
spread and you see the city in

bd6502ad-12a2-4b11-bbda-63868f745971-1
00:53:04.067 --> 00:53:06.540
the background and the little.

8b2ca0b1-a7d8-4005-9469-44fc531512d2-0
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:12.090
White boat is near this huge
ship.

ce1c3d2e-b423-4d6f-a2c3-a9fd2311c0b9-0
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.100
And you can see the other things
that are approaching are of

ce1c3d2e-b423-4d6f-a2c3-a9fd2311c0b9-1
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.336
different sizes. And you have a
submarine, you have a nice

ce1c3d2e-b423-4d6f-a2c3-a9fd2311c0b9-2
00:53:21.336 --> 00:53:24.640
little ship with a horn on top
and a sailboat

92bd2abf-99d2-40fc-b822-8ec27c1e4038-0
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:27.600
And white birds.

1c989b52-edd9-4b05-bc66-70bb3f7fb8b4-0
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:31.990
Ohh my.

e672a213-14c8-442b-9447-cdcdc908941d-0
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.977
So now the white boat has made
it to the dock. It's very tall

e672a213-14c8-442b-9447-cdcdc908941d-1
00:53:38.977 --> 00:53:43.771
dock and very huge ships by this
dock. Two very huge ones. But

e672a213-14c8-442b-9447-cdcdc908941d-2
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:45.750
you see people on the dock

2eee97cc-13b9-465a-a3ea-933a188a2dff-0
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.950
Waiting and waving and.

7ced225a-21ec-4a39-8827-65d76b1392bd-0
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.670
Actually.

b4f74951-e936-48c6-9d0f-c5e13232377c-0
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:58.614
These are two different
pictures, so I missed part of

b4f74951-e936-48c6-9d0f-c5e13232377c-1
00:53:58.614 --> 00:53:58.900
that.

3f41df1d-15ee-41b8-900d-7ac23e6e3019-0
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:05.010
As it must be all in the same
area, though, there's that huge.

a71b63d7-cffd-4cf8-a4b4-efa85e08046e-0
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:12.476
whale like creature that now has
an oxygen take strapped on his

a71b63d7-cffd-4cf8-a4b4-efa85e08046e-1
00:54:12.476 --> 00:54:16.460
back and it looks like he's
wearing clothes.

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-0
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:22.802
He has, he has a shower coming
on his head coming from what I

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-1
00:54:22.802 --> 00:54:27.868
thought was an oxygen tank, but
maybe it's a water tank and he's

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-2
00:54:27.868 --> 00:54:32.700
approaching the dock and the
fish and there's a small fishing

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-3
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:37.376
boat in front of him in that
land buoy and white birds. And

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-4
00:54:37.376 --> 00:54:42.052
so we weren't really quite to
the dock yet. But then in the

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-5
00:54:42.052 --> 00:54:46.729
next picture you see the boats
up close on the dock and you

1eda9985-5c10-4604-98f5-6b9b1f62751c-6
00:54:46.729 --> 00:54:48.210
don't see the whale

cbe1e6d4-6f10-484b-bcba-04373299912f-0
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:53.530
Anymore, even though obviously
he's approaching the dock

0471356b-4e2b-4e50-966e-73b18fa47daa-0
00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.410
Umm.

605661f9-b4bd-487a-843a-e4b090ec9a31-0
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:05.136
OK. On the left hand side you
see the little boat with it's

605661f9-b4bd-487a-843a-e4b090ec9a31-1
00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:09.645
near a couple of smaller boats
and you see the dock in the

605661f9-b4bd-487a-843a-e4b090ec9a31-2
00:55:09.645 --> 00:55:14.155
background and the dock workers
and the cranes and the the

605661f9-b4bd-487a-843a-e4b090ec9a31-3
00:55:14.155 --> 00:55:19.123
freight that they're unloading.
And then on the right hand side,

605661f9-b4bd-487a-843a-e4b090ec9a31-4
00:55:19.123 --> 00:55:23.862
we don't see the little boat
anymore, but we see one of those

605661f9-b4bd-487a-843a-e4b090ec9a31-5
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:27.990
cranes up close and personal
pulling out of the water

1eab9511-08c4-480d-a82e-5207b8076fd5-0
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:35.728
What looks like a sea creature,
but really is some sort of lab,

1eab9511-08c4-480d-a82e-5207b8076fd5-1
00:55:35.728 --> 00:55:41.297
because there are people in the
very top part of it, a glassed

1eab9511-08c4-480d-a82e-5207b8076fd5-2
00:55:41.297 --> 00:55:46.160
in part of it, and the rest of
it has portholes in it.

9226b77b-ee5d-44ed-8f8c-4d3e45d281a1-0
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:57.330
Now on the left hand side you
see another boat.

5398bc4e-1df2-4029-9476-97e1e74be467-0
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:04.171
Which the little white boat is
right next to another boat in

5398bc4e-1df2-4029-9476-97e1e74be467-1
00:56:04.171 --> 00:56:09.860
front of the city near the dock,
and this boat on its crane has

5398bc4e-1df2-4029-9476-97e1e74be467-2
00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:10.660
pulled up

00f13d66-1abd-480e-8692-a17bff94fd9e-0
00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:19.464
The narwhal looking creature and
the saw, what did I call it, saw

00f13d66-1abd-480e-8692-a17bff94fd9e-1
00:56:19.464 --> 00:56:25.426
fish looking creature in a big
net. and on the right hand side

00f13d66-1abd-480e-8692-a17bff94fd9e-2
00:56:25.426 --> 00:56:31.576
you see that the little boat is
approaching the dock and the boy

00f13d66-1abd-480e-8692-a17bff94fd9e-3
00:56:31.576 --> 00:56:37.442
that we saw in the very front,
very first page who was making

00f13d66-1abd-480e-8692-a17bff94fd9e-4
00:56:37.442 --> 00:56:41.889
the boat is coming down the
stairs of the dock

eed891a5-9251-41da-b462-b73a89e6c8c7-0
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.393
With the buildings on the of the
city in the background, go

eed891a5-9251-41da-b462-b73a89e6c8c7-1
00:56:47.393 --> 00:56:47.860
ahead.

4f4e0e59-0a64-4693-815c-ae595eae437e-0
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:51.640
And there you see the city

c441c05a-28bc-4fbf-986d-9bf4c462147f-0
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:53.890
From above.

f0fad8f2-8db3-4135-ba14-a2661959f81b-0
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:59.987
And the water continues to go
through like a river in the city

f0fad8f2-8db3-4135-ba14-a2661959f81b-1
00:56:59.987 --> 00:57:04.929
with some arches, interesting
arches. It looks like people

f0fad8f2-8db3-4135-ba14-a2661959f81b-2
00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:10.290
live in them. There's lights all
in there like it's a house and

f0fad8f2-8db3-4135-ba14-a2661959f81b-3
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:15.232
but the little boat is just
floating along that. And there

f0fad8f2-8db3-4135-ba14-a2661959f81b-4
00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:20.342
are, the one thing that I see
that I recognize is a creature

f0fad8f2-8db3-4135-ba14-a2661959f81b-5
00:57:20.342 --> 00:57:25.620
flying above the boat with bat
like wings and human like legs.

febde71b-c256-457c-afc1-a17086128245-0
00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.781
I think we saw them before, I
said. He had long fins, but

febde71b-c256-457c-afc1-a17086128245-1
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:35.599
above him are this little
propeller things that we saw

febde71b-c256-457c-afc1-a17086128245-2
00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:40.943
like crashed on that Desert
Island before. And up on the top

febde71b-c256-457c-afc1-a17086128245-3
00:57:40.943 --> 00:57:44.710
of one of the buildings in the
center is a

2040e221-7d96-465a-abf5-190119d908ff-0
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:50.323
Is a reindeer. We saw that
before too. Oh, and there's

2040e221-7d96-465a-abf5-190119d908ff-1
00:57:50.323 --> 00:57:55.538
pigeons over on the right hand
side like the birds. Same shape

2040e221-7d96-465a-abf5-190119d908ff-2
00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:57.360
as the birds that were

baecf2a3-10b1-48a8-a5b6-56c0f8c9200d-0
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.010
That we saw before going through
the mangroves.

f4a2b00e-d56f-41fc-8b06-a9124e5904c3-0
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.160
{Just three pages left.}

52d73799-1be6-42f7-a8d5-606244d72184-0
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.792
{Good, you're testing me here. }
OK, now we are back. Um on

52d73799-1be6-42f7-a8d5-606244d72184-1
00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:21.282
underground. Now we're in the
river. The white boat is in the

52d73799-1be6-42f7-a8d5-606244d72184-2
00:58:21.282 --> 00:58:26.330
river. We now see the Nautilus
boat in the river and the

4832a75f-6f6f-4f65-9149-5f375e0025a6-0
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:32.014
A lot of the characters that
were in this before are coming

4832a75f-6f6f-4f65-9149-5f375e0025a6-1
00:58:32.014 --> 00:58:36.920
down the steps to looking at the
little boat. We see the man

4832a75f-6f6f-4f65-9149-5f375e0025a6-2
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:41.584
diver, we see some sort of
jester, which I don't think we

4832a75f-6f6f-4f65-9149-5f375e0025a6-3
00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:46.489
saw before. We saw those two
little creatures that were that

4832a75f-6f6f-4f65-9149-5f375e0025a6-4
00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:50.510
were going through things before
they were on the

be709287-6ae6-4254-904c-51f89e811e4f-0
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.830
They were on the Nautilus ship.

ea9f5d66-6242-4d54-9c3c-83feb43d89be-0
00:58:54.530 --> 00:59:00.021
And now the Nautilus ship has a
the kite sail is not not torn

ea9f5d66-6242-4d54-9c3c-83feb43d89be-1
00:59:00.021 --> 00:59:05.512
anymore, but it's repaired. You
can see that it has sewing on

ea9f5d66-6242-4d54-9c3c-83feb43d89be-2
00:59:05.512 --> 00:59:10.738
it, and the cat is up at the
top, and the man in the black

ea9f5d66-6242-4d54-9c3c-83feb43d89be-3
00:59:10.738 --> 00:59:16.407
costume from the first page with
the horn on his head is now on

ea9f5d66-6242-4d54-9c3c-83feb43d89be-4
00:59:16.407 --> 00:59:21.190
the horse climbing up the
stairs, and the reindeer is

ea9f5d66-6242-4d54-9c3c-83feb43d89be-5
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:24.290
behind him climbing up the
stairs.

9ea4db65-a47b-4636-b745-20f6d869ad85-0
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:30.643
Along with another creature, and
so the boat. Now as we go to the

9ea4db65-a47b-4636-b745-20f6d869ad85-1
00:59:30.643 --> 00:59:34.880
next page, the boat has passed
all of those.

50e3db02-c7ed-4b7e-8c05-25e354586692-0
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:41.693
And we, I don't see anybody
that's familiar. So the boat has

50e3db02-c7ed-4b7e-8c05-25e354586692-1
00:59:41.693 --> 00:59:46.727
gone on even though there are
there's like a one of those sea

50e3db02-c7ed-4b7e-8c05-25e354586692-2
00:59:46.727 --> 00:59:49.570
serpents that's near the
stairway.

f7cda216-2548-4451-8fb9-41a11aadd753-0
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:56.590
And now we have.

dcfa362f-0230-49a1-a46a-496dc9cb66c3-0
00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:02.437
On the left hand side, a picture
of the submarine coming up and

dcfa362f-0230-49a1-a46a-496dc9cb66c3-1
01:00:02.437 --> 01:00:07.495
some of those fish standing up
out of the water with the lights

dcfa362f-0230-49a1-a46a-496dc9cb66c3-2
01:00:07.495 --> 01:00:12.553
for their eyes looking at that.
And they're right near the dock

dcfa362f-0230-49a1-a46a-496dc9cb66c3-3
01:00:12.553 --> 01:00:17.294
where the lamp posts are. And
then in the next page you see

dcfa362f-0230-49a1-a46a-496dc9cb66c3-4
01:00:17.294 --> 01:00:18.480
the little boat

968f05cc-8342-4a18-ba82-cbb32cbbfe98-0
01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.210
going past

9c67bdc5-6ce8-4df5-8cd5-3b583999f276-0
01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.387
The submarine on the left and on
the right there's another little

9c67bdc5-6ce8-4df5-8cd5-3b583999f276-1
01:00:27.387 --> 01:00:32.262
boat that is docked near the big
wall that with stairs going up

9c67bdc5-6ce8-4df5-8cd5-3b583999f276-2
01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:36.300
and it's still night time but
we're in in the river.

fbee146a-48d6-43e9-baf0-b89ba0df545e-0
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.200
{Hey Sir, last page.}

135bf1e1-b0fa-4c76-a02f-d3af990b88ee-0
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:46.580
OK, so the little boat is now
going.

de0213e7-4519-445d-9932-d187cccc8a58-0
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:53.240
To another set of stairs where
there is a lamppost and a house.

3fcdfdbf-7bcd-41bd-8804-fe3f689c2767-0
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:56.570
And.

9a2da733-3017-4bd5-acb2-446dc2d51d7c-0
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:01.690
Yeah, I thought there was a
person at the top of the stairs.

6b7c7f87-001d-43f7-b8d1-42c2cd710e8b-0
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.480
And it's approaching that. And
so you see the little boat.

5b342f7d-fb92-400d-a5cd-0fa5455f6d9c-0
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.460
And you see a person in the
boat.

c2249260-89b8-4b53-b6db-f7249eddf7d9-0
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:13.120
Huh.

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-0
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.412
When you see the first close up
of the boat, you know he's right

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-1
01:01:20.412 --> 01:01:24.422
by the dock and you see that
barely a shadow of somebody

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-2
01:01:24.422 --> 01:01:28.502
inside of it. And the next
picture, you see that person a

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-3
01:01:28.502 --> 01:01:32.653
little more clearly. He's
starting to come out of the peak

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-4
01:01:32.653 --> 01:01:36.874
of the boat and then there's
even more someone else. I mean

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-5
01:01:36.874 --> 01:01:40.813
he's getting out and then the
this person that has just

99447bbe-2238-494d-9a3b-0527c7adbc0d-6
01:01:40.813 --> 01:01:44.050
appeared is now on the steps and
he's getting

a6a948a9-b722-4c1d-9d02-baef8c8dbb25-0
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.270
Clearer and clearer and the boat
is getting

78606a5d-98d6-49f8-8586-08b0bdc9830f-0
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:52.795
More and more
transparent and is disappearing.

78606a5d-98d6-49f8-8586-08b0bdc9830f-1
01:01:52.795 --> 01:01:56.528
And by the time you get to the
bottom, you see the person

78606a5d-98d6-49f8-8586-08b0bdc9830f-2
01:01:56.528 --> 01:02:00.453
climbing up the stairs and no
boat is there anymore and he's

78606a5d-98d6-49f8-8586-08b0bdc9830f-3
01:02:00.453 --> 01:02:04.443
coming up to meet this other
person at the top of the stairs. #END_wanderer 

78606a5d-98d6-49f8-8586-08b0bdc9830f-4
01:02:04.443 --> 01:02:05.280
all right.

13ca4297-21fa-4a73-a5f4-bdf3a376f197-0
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.730
Woo Hoo.

85ab196c-23b0-42c0-b8f5-e37fcd8b7017-0
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:14.960
Now we've got another graphic
novel.

6efb746d-36b1-4e15-8196-f5a29150d583-0
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.290
So this one has five pages.

8f9b6603-56a8-4189-86ab-2c2861fdc63d-0
01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.073
#START_arrival_1 OK, we're back
to the sepia tones and there is

8f9b6603-56a8-4189-86ab-2c2861fdc63d-1
01:02:28.073 --> 01:02:30.630
a page with nine pictures on it.

6d2eed1a-36dc-4f77-aee6-c9328ef88370-0
01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.270
First picture has.

4081afaf-4b9c-49c9-bc0c-1e40e2713ad2-0
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:40.706
A framed family photo on a
ledge. Second picture, there is

4081afaf-4b9c-49c9-bc0c-1e40e2713ad2-1
01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:46.630
a hand picking up that photo.
Third picture, they are putting

4081afaf-4b9c-49c9-bc0c-1e40e2713ad2-2
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.210
that photo in to a wrapper.

a3e56579-611c-49d4-aeb6-2b2c7350baef-0
01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.830
4th picture they're tying up the
wrapper.

17735ddc-70e2-4486-bedb-3abdf7a3a8c8-0
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.210
And.

6167ef89-96be-4fde-a7ce-76e7c934b412-0
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.990
The next two pictures, they're
just

122a4305-9be4-42df-bb13-682f86e414f0-0
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:59.520
Putting it

fe000ac8-f6fe-4d4d-8c15-d4e674c3a949-0
01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.570
Um, into another like a satchel

62f3d4aa-148c-419d-81be-940c7c5cf7e1-0
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:11.669
With a strap on it so that it's
secure inside. Probably a

62f3d4aa-148c-419d-81be-940c7c5cf7e1-1
01:03:11.669 --> 01:03:14.100
leather bag of some sort.

32fc4b49-5763-48a4-9212-5b50618b7d72-0
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:24.760
OK, now we see on the left hand
side.

a1169fa2-919e-4dfa-afbd-99de8f09ce50-0
01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:32.247
9 pictures and on the right hand
side we see one large photo and

a1169fa2-919e-4dfa-afbd-99de8f09ce50-1
01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:38.078
it appears that each of the
items on the left hand side are

a1169fa2-919e-4dfa-afbd-99de8f09ce50-2
01:03:38.078 --> 01:03:43.910
found in the picture on the
right there is an origami bird.

a7b31d6d-cb1c-4c13-a9dc-0b4b3a63a0ab-0
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.100
And.

9b7ee851-2ae4-443d-b830-518a00ad52b2-0
01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:51.740
A clock and a hat on a hook and
a pot

7eb99da9-7ef9-491c-b650-e94c2e31a3af-0
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:59.460
For eating out of. Umm a child's
drawing a cracked teapot.

a1df8f70-d7b8-456e-93ce-e44c6ae20956-0
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:06.978
A cup of coffee or tea with some
maybe money or pictures next to

a1df8f70-d7b8-456e-93ce-e44c6ae20956-1
01:04:06.978 --> 01:04:11.070
it. A suitcase and the family
picture.

137e1b3f-a46c-4dd2-ab9a-83e25f1a4556-0
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:21.493
And they're all found on the
picture and the right and that

137e1b3f-a46c-4dd2-ab9a-83e25f1a4556-1
01:04:21.493 --> 01:04:27.335
and that picture has the man and
woman looks like it's from that

137e1b3f-a46c-4dd2-ab9a-83e25f1a4556-2
01:04:27.335 --> 01:04:33.178
family picture with the suitcase
and their hands on the suitcase

137e1b3f-a46c-4dd2-ab9a-83e25f1a4556-3
01:04:33.178 --> 01:04:38.750
together. Her hand is on top of
his, so he's probably the one

137e1b3f-a46c-4dd2-ab9a-83e25f1a4556-4
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:39.470
leaving.

33d6c8c5-df7f-49fe-a64c-2703ac1f1e0e-0
01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.790
The next picture

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-0
01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.015
Uh, the next page has nine
pictures on the left, and then

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-1
01:04:56.015 --> 01:05:00.778
one picture on the right. And
the pictures on the left are of

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-2
01:05:00.778 --> 01:05:05.617
the little girl who was in that
family, waking up, stretching,

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-3
01:05:05.617 --> 01:05:10.457
eating breakfast, noticing the
suitcase, seeing her dad put on

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-4
01:05:10.457 --> 01:05:14.989
his hat. Her mom put on her
kerchief, and then she puts on

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-5
01:05:14.989 --> 01:05:19.905
her hat in their dressing her to
go outside with boots. And she

ae407c16-cab7-4ec6-9fe4-c75980f755ff-6
01:05:19.905 --> 01:05:20.290
waits

e3a15ed8-da90-4bca-be92-029f893fcdce-0
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.103
For them. And then the dad
reaches an apparently he's going

e3a15ed8-da90-4bca-be92-029f893fcdce-1
01:05:25.103 --> 01:05:30.243
to get his suitcase. The picture
on the right is a large picture

e3a15ed8-da90-4bca-be92-029f893fcdce-2
01:05:30.243 --> 01:05:34.907
of them, apparently outside the
door of their home walking

e3a15ed8-da90-4bca-be92-029f893fcdce-3
01:05:34.907 --> 01:05:39.335
together. The dad has the
suitcase, and the shadow of a

e3a15ed8-da90-4bca-be92-029f893fcdce-4
01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:42.339
large dragon tail is on the
building.

c3324bed-48bb-4c84-a283-c769fdcd7002-0
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:54.044
So the next one tells a story,
mostly in little pictures.

c3324bed-48bb-4c84-a283-c769fdcd7002-1
01:05:54.044 --> 01:05:58.558
You've got the little girl
holding her hand, dad's hand

c3324bed-48bb-4c84-a283-c769fdcd7002-2
01:05:58.558 --> 01:06:03.393
looking up at him, looking
around, and then they are at the

c3324bed-48bb-4c84-a283-c769fdcd7002-3
01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:08.471
train station and they are in
the middle of some other people.

c3324bed-48bb-4c84-a283-c769fdcd7002-4
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:13.549
But the big picture is the train
station. And then you see her

c3324bed-48bb-4c84-a283-c769fdcd7002-5
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:15.000
looking her dad is

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-0
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.008
Talking to her because it has
his hand on her shoulder and

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-1
01:06:20.008 --> 01:06:24.504
she's looking up at him and he
takes off his hat and there's

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-2
01:06:24.504 --> 01:06:28.926
the origami bird and he puts it
in her hands and then she's

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-3
01:06:28.926 --> 01:06:33.716
looking at it. He's hugging her
goodbye. She keeps the bird. The

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-4
01:06:33.716 --> 01:06:38.359
mom is crying. The mom hugs the
dad and he talks to her in her

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-5
01:06:38.359 --> 01:06:43.003
ear. Then he takes the suitcase
and goes up into the train and

c62115c8-d18a-44b0-a310-13ac5764e5e9-6
01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:45.730
they all reach hands as long as
they

b16e70f5-541f-4de2-8c05-ac1fb311cc2b-0
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.620
can and then you see the train
pulling away

b41d60e1-74aa-4d6a-8baa-bf4be11081b6-0
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.760
In the distance.

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-0
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:56.327
So here we have, we see the
family picture right away. And

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-1
01:06:56.327 --> 01:07:00.511
so we know the family pictures
with the dad because it's in the

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-2
01:07:00.511 --> 01:07:04.433
suitcase. And so we see that
he's put it, put taking it out

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-3
01:07:04.433 --> 01:07:08.225
of the suitcase and he's
wherever it is that he's eating,

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-4
01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:12.409
he's eating a bowl of soup and
looking at the picture. And then

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-5
01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:16.528
you see we back off out of that
picture and you see that he is

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-6
01:07:16.528 --> 01:07:20.777
in a porthole. So he's in a room
on a ship and you just see more

e6d76443-6815-4ed9-ad2c-b6ba66dcb2db-7
01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.020
and more portholes.

f3930255-1384-46e6-a7e9-d6ee213b7296-0
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:27.010
And then it's a
huge ship and we just back

f3930255-1384-46e6-a7e9-d6ee213b7296-1
01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:32.417
further like you're zooming out
and then you see that it's on a

f3930255-1384-46e6-a7e9-d6ee213b7296-2
01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:36.219
big ocean liner. #END_arrival_1 OK, so then
that one now.

75232e61-c3aa-437f-a0d4-2d90324eef4a-0
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:40.770
We've got another part of the
story. There's 4 pages.

0a2f1047-2700-4f80-b7ec-9f258633afa9-0
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:42.150
OK.

70fea7c5-3222-43a4-9051-18356f01d3f0-0
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.940
This is the same story.

8a55f48b-9d34-42a2-8a53-c5488abdf859-0
01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.520
Different parts, right. OK.

6d28d2c7-e7b7-4267-ac67-17ff35ccd3d6-0
01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.097
#START_arrival_5 So I'm still
sepia tone and when we look at

6d28d2c7-e7b7-4267-ac67-17ff35ccd3d6-1
01:07:55.097 --> 01:07:56.300
the picture on the left.

9a44c16d-8db3-49b8-a941-c510339533bc-0
01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:58.220
It's a city.

8b8bb775-1ef3-4d6d-92ed-669c35c99d54-0
01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:03.760
It's a City made of buildings
that look like owls.

87666f5f-7ae7-4d48-90c5-b05abfee285c-0
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:06.470
And um.

10f224dc-6a35-4a0e-8b14-04c235d68cc3-0
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:14.367
There are boats and water in the
front like it's on a river, a

10f224dc-6a35-4a0e-8b14-04c235d68cc3-1
01:08:14.367 --> 01:08:20.678
dock with boats on it and a
buildings of multi stories on a

10f224dc-6a35-4a0e-8b14-04c235d68cc3-2
01:08:20.678 --> 01:08:21.520
terrace 

3f24b984-ec6f-44fe-b3cf-23fcb12a587b-0
01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.270
Piece of land.

c1301eb3-c289-427e-9814-838b7a943fd4-0
01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.210
Umm.

64b83884-cb44-4940-b19d-d028a5cd90fc-0
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.530
So the pictures on the right
tell the story.

370da604-36e4-4a35-a54d-05b7ba1f2581-0
01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.000
It appears that the boat,

29f70846-8d07-4d37-b780-90c8fc6ad885-0
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:42.234
I would say the boat is being
tied up onto a post that looks

29f70846-8d07-4d37-b780-90c8fc6ad885-1
01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:44.830
like a cat and the man is

4fdea0b6-b67c-4573-8135-08c4ecde373f-0
01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.340
The man, the father

269569f9-98fe-4a93-b065-1d071d472653-0
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:54.265
Is the man in the hat, and then
there's another man who is

269569f9-98fe-4a93-b065-1d071d472653-1
01:08:54.265 --> 01:09:00.041
guiding him, showing him the
way, and then we see a child

269569f9-98fe-4a93-b065-1d071d472653-2
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:00.440
with

5bc73a08-b824-469b-8288-23576fffcece-0
01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:07.690
With two pets carrying something
up the stairs, and the child

5bc73a08-b824-469b-8288-23576fffcece-1
01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:13.495
gives this bowl to his mother,
it appears, a woman, and then

5bc73a08-b824-469b-8288-23576fffcece-2
01:09:13.495 --> 01:09:19.300
the the man who was guiding the
father, the blonde man, I'll

5bc73a08-b824-469b-8288-23576fffcece-3
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:25.581
call him, he greets the woman. I
don't know if it's a relative or

5bc73a08-b824-469b-8288-23576fffcece-4
01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:30.530
a wife, but he has a basket of
things as well, and.

d18a440e-502e-455a-bf9e-0202d9941371-0
01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:35.861
Or maybe he takes them from her,
I don't know. And then they both

d18a440e-502e-455a-bf9e-0202d9941371-1
01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:40.302
greet the father, who is taking
his hat off and greeting them.

d18a440e-502e-455a-bf9e-0202d9941371-2
01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:44.672
She welcomes them in, they have
something to drink and share,

d18a440e-502e-455a-bf9e-0202d9941371-3
01:09:44.672 --> 01:09:47.210
and then they share food from
that.

8a0cfefb-b9f6-4a64-817f-e9c35034186c-0
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:52.948
Basket with a little bit of
preparation that they're having

8a0cfefb-b9f6-4a64-817f-e9c35034186c-1
01:09:52.948 --> 01:09:53.420
to do.

d5431dd2-cc65-44d3-a5da-7099e1a055f8-0
01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.510
So then,

743de74c-f578-4a59-a785-85cb4ea982d0-0
01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:05.237
On the left, there's a big
picture of them eating together,

743de74c-f578-4a59-a785-85cb4ea982d0-1
01:10:05.237 --> 01:10:10.255
the strange food at a table.
There's the boy and the blonde

743de74c-f578-4a59-a785-85cb4ea982d0-2
01:10:10.255 --> 01:10:15.441
man and the woman and the father
and the pets are down on the

743de74c-f578-4a59-a785-85cb4ea982d0-3
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:20.459
floor eating some, and the
father appears to be cooking one

743de74c-f578-4a59-a785-85cb4ea982d0-4
01:10:20.459 --> 01:10:21.630
of these. Umm.

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-0
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:27.016
One of these things for dinner
with a torch and they're they're

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-1
01:10:27.016 --> 01:10:31.189
eating their utensils and
everything. So on the right hand

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-2
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:35.573
side you see them blonde man
laughing, the lady laughing, the

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-3
01:10:35.573 --> 01:10:40.029
father laughing and looks like
he's explaining something. Then

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-4
01:10:40.029 --> 01:10:44.555
the father plays an instrument,
the mother plays an instrument,

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-5
01:10:44.555 --> 01:10:49.153
the boy plays an instrument, and
then the father takes his piece

d8d251d5-c2ad-4849-8794-f943c62787d1-6
01:10:49.153 --> 01:10:52.759
of paper out of his book and
makes an origami cat.

6df0e5b8-7509-4302-b7ba-53f58cd2e8bc-0
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:59.455
And gives it to the boy, and the
father takes out a pot, a clay

6df0e5b8-7509-4302-b7ba-53f58cd2e8bc-1
01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:05.170
like a clay pot, out of a
cupboard, and the man and woman

ad843e7f-f937-495f-8700-04e853b9e618-0
01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.580
Uh.

f2b4efa7-f57f-4643-89b9-15be1d834a81-0
01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:12.686
 have it together like they're
telling him about it, and then

f2b4efa7-f57f-4643-89b9-15be1d834a81-1
01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:15.385
you see it being held in the
man's hands, the blonde man's

f2b4efa7-f57f-4643-89b9-15be1d834a81-2
01:11:15.385 --> 01:11:15.660
hands.

afc8e255-02e6-4cd8-8c36-62a582158fa2-0
01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.550
So.

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-0
01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:29.355
Ah, then we have a series of
pictures that tell the story.

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-1
01:11:29.355 --> 01:11:33.952
You see the pot, you see it's
all rather dull in the picture.

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-2
01:11:33.952 --> 01:11:38.179
And then you see the light
coming out like it's daylight

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-3
01:11:38.179 --> 01:11:42.554
and the pot is in the window
frame, or or at least you can

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-4
01:11:42.554 --> 01:11:47.077
see that's where the lights
coming in. Then the father wakes

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-5
01:11:47.077 --> 01:11:51.823
up and the one of the pets from
the family is there and he gets

4d7b2b2d-051d-447e-b7f0-d0048c6d2aab-6
01:11:51.823 --> 01:11:56.049
is with him on the bed and then
the father gets dressed.

aab23590-b3fc-4e88-b6c2-6f0ae3b49ad2-0
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:57.200
And.

7ee4ec79-7264-4657-b324-dc501b9f2eee-0
01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:04.296
Cuts a piece of whatever he was
eating and gives it to the pet.

7ee4ec79-7264-4657-b324-dc501b9f2eee-1
01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:09.964
Puts on his jacket, finishes
dressing and the pet is handing

7ee4ec79-7264-4657-b324-dc501b9f2eee-2
01:12:09.964 --> 01:12:11.080
him his hat.

09d5ce21-e0be-41d7-bcad-60f9567fc71f-0
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.813
So we have a half page picture
that shows the man walking

09d5ce21-e0be-41d7-bcad-60f9567fc71f-1
01:12:20.813 --> 01:12:26.346
through the crowds outside with
the pet next to the the Father

09d5ce21-e0be-41d7-bcad-60f9567fc71f-2
01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:31.879
man walking outside with the pet
next to him. And then you see

09d5ce21-e0be-41d7-bcad-60f9567fc71f-3
01:12:31.879 --> 01:12:37.149
people working, some of them are
pulling on ropes or poking

09d5ce21-e0be-41d7-bcad-60f9567fc71f-4
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:42.594
things into a furnace. I can't
tell which it is. Looks like a

09d5ce21-e0be-41d7-bcad-60f9567fc71f-5
01:12:42.594 --> 01:12:44.790
furnace. I guess there is

0f271a1e-3817-4a23-ab15-9354955a7823-0
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:50.183
A man with a big hat taking
things out of a basket to feed

0f271a1e-3817-4a23-ab15-9354955a7823-1
01:12:50.183 --> 01:12:55.342
animals. There is 3 people in
the next picture where one of

0f271a1e-3817-4a23-ab15-9354955a7823-2
01:12:55.342 --> 01:12:59.727
them is making payment for
something that is being

0f271a1e-3817-4a23-ab15-9354955a7823-3
01:12:59.727 --> 01:13:04.800
purchased. So it's like a
market, the outdoor marketplace.

0f271a1e-3817-4a23-ab15-9354955a7823-4
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.660
someone is

4b52d0ab-429d-4223-849a-784edbbe88b4-0
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.629
Doing some artwork. Someone's
painting on a wall and someone

4b52d0ab-429d-4223-849a-784edbbe88b4-1
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:17.200
is it appears to be maybe fixing
some food on a food cart. So the

4b52d0ab-429d-4223-849a-784edbbe88b4-2
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.927
father and then on the right
hand side there's four big

4b52d0ab-429d-4223-849a-784edbbe88b4-3
01:13:21.927 --> 01:13:27.329
pictures are good size pictures.
And then the father is talking

4b52d0ab-429d-4223-849a-784edbbe88b4-4
01:13:27.329 --> 01:13:32.478
to someone who is wearing a
bakers outfit and the man is the

4b52d0ab-429d-4223-849a-784edbbe88b4-5
01:13:32.478 --> 01:13:36.530
Baker is saying like no thank
you. And then the

4190ca11-494b-44bb-8d8b-3a50c3bfea9a-0
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:42.555
Father is talking to someone in
front of like a big boiler. Uh,

4190ca11-494b-44bb-8d8b-3a50c3bfea9a-1
01:13:42.555 --> 01:13:46.760
he has tools in his hand like a
wrench and the.

17346aa7-837f-4d7d-8ad2-2ca425d9f8fa-0
01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:53.498
The man is saying no with his
hand. And then you see the

17346aa7-837f-4d7d-8ad2-2ca425d9f8fa-1
01:13:53.498 --> 01:13:58.719
father in a in a shop where it
might be a pet store. There's

17346aa7-837f-4d7d-8ad2-2ca425d9f8fa-2
01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:04.283
all these little pets and pots,
and the woman is putting up both

17346aa7-837f-4d7d-8ad2-2ca425d9f8fa-3
01:14:04.283 --> 01:14:09.589
hands like no, no, thank you.
And then you see him going to a

17346aa7-837f-4d7d-8ad2-2ca425d9f8fa-4
01:14:09.589 --> 01:14:10.360
shipyard.

345216c2-ea78-4089-a554-0bcc4e25f06e-0
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:14.842
Because you see
the big propeller and people

345216c2-ea78-4089-a554-0bcc4e25f06e-1
01:14:14.842 --> 01:14:18.488
fixing ships, and he's talking
to another man, explaining

345216c2-ea78-4089-a554-0bcc4e25f06e-2
01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:22.512
something, and the man had his
hand up, and since everyone else

345216c2-ea78-4089-a554-0bcc4e25f06e-3
01:14:22.512 --> 01:14:26.410
had their hand up saying no,
he's probably saying no as well,

345216c2-ea78-4089-a554-0bcc4e25f06e-4
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:28.799
right? #END_arrival_5 OK, so another part is
done.

f7990b3d-9dfd-409e-b5bf-939ba1a2ed49-0
01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:33.890
OK, so here we go. Another
part of it. Sure.

6d449a6d-c702-469a-813e-11739c9ddb9b-0
01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:40.564
#START_arrival_3 OK, so now
everything still sepia. We see 8

6d449a6d-c702-469a-813e-11739c9ddb9b-1
01:14:40.564 --> 01:14:45.075
pictures on 2 pages. One is
someone carrying a sign board

6d449a6d-c702-469a-813e-11739c9ddb9b-2
01:14:45.075 --> 01:14:49.898
like he's selling newspapers.
One is a lady carrying a cat or

6d449a6d-c702-469a-813e-11739c9ddb9b-3
01:14:49.898 --> 01:14:54.954
holding a cat talking to another
lady. One is like a Barber shop

6d449a6d-c702-469a-813e-11739c9ddb9b-4
01:14:54.954 --> 01:15:00.087
in this country. The next one is
someone playing music out on the

6d449a6d-c702-469a-813e-11739c9ddb9b-5
01:15:00.087 --> 01:15:03.509
two people playing music out on
the street.

0377db54-728c-4eec-8104-35ec4290ea7d-0
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:05.320
Umm.

8a08ae31-99f8-42c7-a2a0-392d9c958226-0
01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.491
Then there's one with someone.
He's preparing something. It

8a08ae31-99f8-42c7-a2a0-392d9c958226-1
01:15:10.491 --> 01:15:13.800
looks like a teapot, and
something that would be

7b14e13b-41b4-4ca3-9304-365271dce274-0
01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:19.068
To drink, but he has a cart and
looks like he has he's going to

7b14e13b-41b4-4ca3-9304-365271dce274-1
01:15:19.068 --> 01:15:20.170
sell these things.

4672df7f-134f-49da-a2b0-3cc362bad524-0
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:23.540
And then the next one is a man
and woman with

a168e802-7769-474d-8940-df90948fa00c-0
01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:29.567
Some items that they have for
sale, I can't tell what they

a168e802-7769-474d-8940-df90948fa00c-1
01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:34.565
are, whether it's like big
loaves of bread or flat pots or

a168e802-7769-474d-8940-df90948fa00c-2
01:15:34.565 --> 01:15:39.986
gourds or whatever. And then you
see people sitting and reading

a168e802-7769-474d-8940-df90948fa00c-3
01:15:39.986 --> 01:15:45.153
things from someone is reading
from the newspaper while they

a168e802-7769-474d-8940-df90948fa00c-4
01:15:45.153 --> 01:15:50.405
are sitting around together. And
then the last picture is the

a168e802-7769-474d-8940-df90948fa00c-5
01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:54.810
father with his suitcase in his
hand looking around

1e590847-e244-44dd-aea2-77566e85b4c5-0
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.500
Like he's wondering either which
way to go or what to do next.

555ca684-e489-469a-9beb-01edca125f00-0
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:09.888
OK, there are small pictures all
over these two pages and the

555ca684-e489-469a-9beb-01edca125f00-1
01:16:09.888 --> 01:16:15.485
first one is the father looking
at his watch, then looking up at

555ca684-e489-469a-9beb-01edca125f00-2
01:16:15.485 --> 01:16:17.380
another time piece and

04681999-726c-422b-9894-16f874e2cca3-0
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:23.963
Thinking like, has a worried
look. And so then you see him

04681999-726c-422b-9894-16f874e2cca3-1
01:16:23.963 --> 01:16:29.642
walking from through the streets
and walking in front of the

04681999-726c-422b-9894-16f874e2cca3-2
01:16:29.642 --> 01:16:35.228
building and walking further and
further and there's little

04681999-726c-422b-9894-16f874e2cca3-3
01:16:35.228 --> 01:16:38.580
lights all around like it's
snowing

45f7be17-9ceb-4087-9636-0dd56d9face9-0
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.673
Or raining hail maybe because
then the you could see that the

45f7be17-9ceb-4087-9636-0dd56d9face9-1
01:16:44.673 --> 01:16:49.538
wind has blown, it blows his hat
off and these little what were

45f7be17-9ceb-4087-9636-0dd56d9face9-2
01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:54.023
looked like lights or snowflakes
or hail are now streaking

45f7be17-9ceb-4087-9636-0dd56d9face9-3
01:16:54.023 --> 01:16:58.964
through from the wind. And so he
had dropped his hat and he goes

45f7be17-9ceb-4087-9636-0dd56d9face9-4
01:16:58.964 --> 01:17:03.070
down to pick up his hat and as
he does he looks down.

afa884cf-492e-42f3-b4ac-1004ae546d0a-0
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.780
And on the ground is a map, and
it becomes very interesting to

afa884cf-492e-42f3-b4ac-1004ae546d0a-1
01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:15.721
him. So he Stoops down, looks at
his book, looks at some words

afa884cf-492e-42f3-b4ac-1004ae546d0a-2
01:17:15.721 --> 01:17:21.474
that were giving him direction,
and compares that while he's

afa884cf-492e-42f3-b4ac-1004ae546d0a-3
01:17:21.474 --> 01:17:26.849
doing so, a man in a turban
comes up and taps him on the

afa884cf-492e-42f3-b4ac-1004ae546d0a-4
01:17:26.849 --> 01:17:32.790
shoulder to get his attention
and explains some things to him.

7fe11346-dbcc-4bb2-b48f-d14588c5d97c-0
01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:38.456
Um, because he doesn't speak
this language, apparently. So

7fe11346-dbcc-4bb2-b48f-d14588c5d97c-1
01:17:38.456 --> 01:17:43.615
the father is trying to say what
he needs. The man is trying to

7fe11346-dbcc-4bb2-b48f-d14588c5d97c-2
01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:48.613
explain. And finally the father
makes a drawing of a bed. And

7fe11346-dbcc-4bb2-b48f-d14588c5d97c-3
01:17:48.613 --> 01:17:53.691
and he said that the man knows
what he wants. And then the man

7fe11346-dbcc-4bb2-b48f-d14588c5d97c-4
01:17:53.691 --> 01:17:58.851
goes like, Oh yes, and he then
directs him where he needs to go

7fe11346-dbcc-4bb2-b48f-d14588c5d97c-5
01:17:58.851 --> 01:18:02.640
or tells him the way and then
leads the man on

322fd720-e842-4cc5-b3eb-52520ae082a9-0
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:07.360
Leads the father
and while he's walking. #END_arrival_3 

219c0981-ea19-4ff2-98ec-f96fe3655de3-0
01:18:08.190 --> 01:18:13.834
OK, so that was another part of
the story. Yeah. So now we have

219c0981-ea19-4ff2-98ec-f96fe3655de3-1
01:18:13.834 --> 01:18:18.610
something different. This one is
a complex scene, OK?

61075b16-ea5d-4a84-b5fc-71a4a8331ef9-0
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:24.360
Ha, alright, yeah.

4cdf3625-5dc5-409c-958d-eaab1b65eb1b-0
01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.240
Another where's Waldo. Of
course, I haven't even looked

4cdf3625-5dc5-409c-958d-eaab1b65eb1b-1
01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:31.850
for Waldo.

f39df30d-9a14-4497-834a-b280c34b8c67-0
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:37.361
#START_escape_from_the_zoo So
this is called escape from the

f39df30d-9a14-4497-834a-b280c34b8c67-1
01:18:37.361 --> 01:18:37.620
zoo.

7a267ae4-f4b5-45f0-ba69-49bb507aacef-0
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.690
And um

d96ece68-def2-4450-bfbc-bbf6c1cc997a-0
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:48.931
So you have an overview of a big
zoo, the kind where all the

d96ece68-def2-4450-bfbc-bbf6c1cc997a-1
01:18:48.931 --> 01:18:52.330
animals are outside in various

da0dd006-8b4c-4d0d-90af-92e03ca5cfe8-0
01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.600
Uh, areas where they'll be

8353dfec-0668-4427-b5f1-049fba2588ea-0
01:18:57.510 --> 01:19:02.616
Where the people will be safe
from them, but they're not caged

8353dfec-0668-4427-b5f1-049fba2588ea-1
01:19:02.616 --> 01:19:07.723
in above. So you're looking at
the whole thing and we'll start

8353dfec-0668-4427-b5f1-049fba2588ea-2
01:19:07.723 --> 01:19:12.586
on the right hand side where
people come in. There's a shop

8353dfec-0668-4427-b5f1-049fba2588ea-3
01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:17.774
and a cafe and and the entrance
where people are buying tickets

8353dfec-0668-4427-b5f1-049fba2588ea-4
01:19:17.774 --> 01:19:21.260
and so you see birds all over
and they are

e94709ac-5402-44f6-bee8-0f0bdcb08b3f-0
01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.630
They are free to go places.

000b4fb8-18f2-4561-821d-60a257f61c6b-0
01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:32.153
As we go around to the right,
you have gorillas and maybe some

000b4fb8-18f2-4561-821d-60a257f61c6b-1
01:19:32.153 --> 01:19:37.689
other sort of primate, but
definitely a gorilla up at the

000b4fb8-18f2-4561-821d-60a257f61c6b-2
01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:43.129
top. And these are on a
mountain, Rocky Mountain kind of

000b4fb8-18f2-4561-821d-60a257f61c6b-3
01:19:43.129 --> 01:19:49.047
place. There are guardrails all
over, people looking. Rangers

000b4fb8-18f2-4561-821d-60a257f61c6b-4
01:19:49.047 --> 01:19:55.347
telling kids not to climb on the
rails as we go further around to

000b4fb8-18f2-4561-821d-60a257f61c6b-5
01:19:55.347 --> 01:19:56.970
the right or down

18ef6427-ce54-46ba-af34-96f5b174b04b-0
01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:02.890
We see someone flying in a plane
over the zoo. We see birds

18ef6427-ce54-46ba-af34-96f5b174b04b-1
01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:08.290
flying. We see tall giraffes in
this next scene, along with

18ef6427-ce54-46ba-af34-96f5b174b04b-2
01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:09.460
anteaters and

cd0f6c98-1870-46a2-b846-2938abe58599-0
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:11.630
Ohh.

e74d83b6-23bc-404b-b0bc-472e93d48f53-0
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:17.495
Those antelopes with the curvy
horns and something else. It

e74d83b6-23bc-404b-b0bc-472e93d48f53-1
01:20:17.495 --> 01:20:21.700
might be like a boar. Yeah, I
think it is a boar.

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-0
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:27.528
All in one area, which is
interesting, one of the kids is

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-1
01:20:27.528 --> 01:20:31.952
throwing popcorn into there,
which is not allowed we know, as

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-2
01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:35.805
you keep going around where
people would walk around.

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-3
01:20:35.805 --> 01:20:39.943
There's someone selling hot
dogs. You can see the ketchup

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-4
01:20:39.943 --> 01:20:44.510
and and mustard out there, the
guy serving hot dog. Some of the

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-5
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:49.219
kids are wearing masks, some are
eating, some are just looking at

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-6
01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:53.572
everything, some are scared,
some are not. And then there is

e6f21554-6578-4f6c-9063-6dec032a442c-7
01:20:53.572 --> 01:20:54.499
a rhinoceros.

a65c5a8b-dfaa-4afe-a5ca-000674d376a5-0
01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:01.886
That has gotten out of his place
and is running along, and

a65c5a8b-dfaa-4afe-a5ca-000674d376a5-1
01:21:01.886 --> 01:21:03.230
actually, I

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-0
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.404
The children are running in
front of him, like to get out of

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-1
01:21:08.404 --> 01:21:12.595
his way. I'm not sure he's
chasing them. He's just going

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-2
01:21:12.595 --> 01:21:17.227
along. But he has a happy face
and and he has a Penguin on his

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-3
01:21:17.227 --> 01:21:21.417
back. So everybody's trying to
get out of the way of the

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-4
01:21:21.417 --> 01:21:25.902
rhinoceros. Even a couple of
people who jumped over the rail

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-5
01:21:25.902 --> 01:21:30.755
and found that they were then in
the Lions den, not exactly where

877850d4-e45c-4cf0-afc3-918778e1470d-6
01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:33.989
they should be, and now they're
scared, so.

facf6819-57c4-4401-9c4e-2c47cc8cb399-0
01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:39.492
Keeping on going around, we see
people taking pictures of a

facf6819-57c4-4401-9c4e-2c47cc8cb399-1
01:21:39.492 --> 01:21:44.862
Peacock, people looking at the
the animals in the water pen,

facf6819-57c4-4401-9c4e-2c47cc8cb399-2
01:21:44.862 --> 01:21:49.705
which is a hippopotamus and
flamingos and looks like a

facf6819-57c4-4401-9c4e-2c47cc8cb399-3
01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:55.339
roseate spoonbill, but it's not
pink, and then a zebra in there

facf6819-57c4-4401-9c4e-2c47cc8cb399-4
01:21:55.339 --> 01:21:56.220
with them.

7a1e7e12-8ac2-49ee-9371-c94ebf04f885-0
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:02.209
And then going on further
around, you have lemurs up in

7a1e7e12-8ac2-49ee-9371-c94ebf04f885-1
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:07.180
the trees and birds that are
probably a parrot of some sort

7a1e7e12-8ac2-49ee-9371-c94ebf04f885-2
01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:12.067
or that's what it looks like.
And then further back on the

7a1e7e12-8ac2-49ee-9371-c94ebf04f885-3
01:22:12.067 --> 01:22:17.121
left is ice where the polar
bears are and there's several of

7a1e7e12-8ac2-49ee-9371-c94ebf04f885-4
01:22:17.121 --> 01:22:22.506
them there. One is in the water
and people are looking at all of

7a1e7e12-8ac2-49ee-9371-c94ebf04f885-5
01:22:22.506 --> 01:22:26.980
those and then behind them
toward the back at the top

a7c63cea-d2b0-4b2f-a6e1-2cfbb7782c5a-0
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:31.850
there's elephants and a probably
that's an ostrich.

27eca26a-165d-4b28-b557-b26570576af8-0
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:34.070
And.

ed9e7b9c-0a18-49e4-836f-c66834266916-0
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:39.645
Benches where people can sit and
then right in the middle of this

ed9e7b9c-0a18-49e4-836f-c66834266916-1
01:22:39.645 --> 01:22:44.288
circle that we've just walked
all around is like an ice castle

ed9e7b9c-0a18-49e4-836f-c66834266916-2
01:22:44.288 --> 01:22:44.510
and

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-0
01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:49.576
There's someone there with a
net. I'm not sure why, because I

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-1
01:22:49.576 --> 01:22:53.194
don't think they're going to
capture anything, but maybe

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-2
01:22:53.194 --> 01:22:57.131
that's where the Penguin came
from, because there is a ladder

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-3
01:22:57.131 --> 01:23:00.749
that is coming, like a rope
ladder that has been put out

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-4
01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:04.685
over it. Like someone made an
escape. And we did see that the

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-5
01:23:04.685 --> 01:23:08.114
Penguin was on top of the
rhinoceros, so maybe that's

71e29b2c-d0b2-4ff4-acb0-6ee56716beb2-6
01:23:08.114 --> 01:23:09.130
where they were.

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-0
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.989
There's
an ice cream place that looks

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-1
01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:19.437
like a big ice cream cone right
next to that. And of course

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-2
01:23:19.437 --> 01:23:23.736
there's a line of people there.
But basically everybody's

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-3
01:23:23.736 --> 01:23:28.035
enjoying it except for those
that are being chased by the

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-4
01:23:28.035 --> 01:23:32.779
rhinoceros. #END_escape_from_the_zoo OK, perfect. That
was about 5 minutes. OK. So this

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-5
01:23:32.779 --> 01:23:37.153
would be the last time we do
maybe. So we actually have 26

b2717293-ab5a-4c18-a543-b38c7bbc16de-6
01:23:37.153 --> 01:23:41.229
item in total and now we're 25
and this is a 20 page.

c4027200-b38b-41ab-a0d8-76b07d140ec6-0
01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.640
Don't worry, OK?

44ed2343-93e4-4d36-8075-af62024515a0-0
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:55.812
#START_return OK, I recognize
these people. This is basically

44ed2343-93e4-4d36-8075-af62024515a0-1
01:23:55.812 --> 01:23:57.200
a sepia tone with

b2c16752-b875-41ce-af94-54c9c20472f2-0
01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.390
Some colors.

e7680faf-19e4-413f-9447-980c6c78619d-0
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:06.150
For the things that they are
highlighting, so we begin with a

e7680faf-19e4-413f-9447-980c6c78619d-1
01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:11.098
street scene with a brownstone
multi story house and a traffic

e7680faf-19e4-413f-9447-980c6c78619d-2
01:24:11.098 --> 01:24:15.890
light where the only thing in
the picture that is colored is

e7680faf-19e4-413f-9447-980c6c78619d-3
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:16.990
the red light.

7f1591d0-e3d2-4c80-aa88-2e95d9eda3e3-0
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:22.780
We go into the house and there
is

2531a44c-5bd8-4a22-960b-efa60e004129-0
01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:25.130
Uh.

66f48621-b1dc-47e9-ae1c-240474c560ec-0
01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:31.182
This is a cutaway of the House,
so you see upstairs and

66f48621-b1dc-47e9-ae1c-240474c560ec-1
01:24:31.182 --> 01:24:36.090
downstairs. So let's start with
the lower part. The lower part

66f48621-b1dc-47e9-ae1c-240474c560ec-2
01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:40.142
of the cutaway shows you
underneath the street, the

66f48621-b1dc-47e9-ae1c-240474c560ec-3
01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:44.894
piping and the boiler and that
kind of stuff. Then the first

66f48621-b1dc-47e9-ae1c-240474c560ec-4
01:24:44.894 --> 01:24:49.880
level is where you walk in the
entry, a place to hang coats and

66f48621-b1dc-47e9-ae1c-240474c560ec-5
01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.270
hats.

13dfea7f-09c1-425c-b747-9a6f3a85d14e-0
01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:59.034
Mirror on the wall and stairs
that go upstairs and then behind

13dfea7f-09c1-425c-b747-9a6f3a85d14e-1
01:24:59.034 --> 01:25:05.527
that is the kitchen with
cabinets, a stove, a sink, and

13dfea7f-09c1-425c-b747-9a6f3a85d14e-2
01:25:05.527 --> 01:25:10.050
then behind that is another
staircase.

b1acff19-a500-4fb6-b504-c9f092de3b92-0
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.870
And then

b38372e5-018a-4251-bd5d-a9ffe2bb7e42-0
01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:20.991
The back room is where the girl
has her bedroom and you see her

b38372e5-018a-4251-bd5d-a9ffe2bb7e42-1
01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:26.854
bed and dresser and window and
she has some colored things on

b38372e5-018a-4251-bd5d-a9ffe2bb7e42-2
01:25:26.854 --> 01:25:32.433
her bed. There's some color in
her room. A map on the wall

b38372e5-018a-4251-bd5d-a9ffe2bb7e42-3
01:25:32.433 --> 01:25:38.107
looks like 2 mobiles hanging
from the ceiling and she has a

b38372e5-018a-4251-bd5d-a9ffe2bb7e42-4
01:25:38.107 --> 01:25:40.850
red crayon in her hand, a red

f0069bdb-9fe7-492e-83bf-f1d221f0f1b8-0
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.620
Crown on her head and looks like
a ball or balloon in her arm and

f0069bdb-9fe7-492e-83bf-f1d221f0f1b8-1
01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:52.336
she is drawing a doorway with
the red crayon now up above her,

f0069bdb-9fe7-492e-83bf-f1d221f0f1b8-2
01:25:52.336 --> 01:25:56.752
starting at the front you have,
I'm going to assume it's a

f0069bdb-9fe7-492e-83bf-f1d221f0f1b8-3
01:25:56.752 --> 01:26:01.468
father since he has a beard. He
is sitting at a drawing table.

f0069bdb-9fe7-492e-83bf-f1d221f0f1b8-4
01:26:01.468 --> 01:26:03.490
Looks like he's doing work.

4e1d967e-b133-494f-9c2d-b46f6a66c6c7-0
01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.891
There is a red kite in the room
and his clothes are blue so he

4e1d967e-b133-494f-9c2d-b46f6a66c6c7-1
01:26:10.891 --> 01:26:16.142
has some color in there. We go
out the door, you see there's a

4e1d967e-b133-494f-9c2d-b46f6a66c6c7-2
01:26:16.142 --> 01:26:21.393
stairway that goes down and that
is just like it appears to be

4e1d967e-b133-494f-9c2d-b46f6a66c6c7-3
01:26:21.393 --> 01:26:26.894
the landing area at the top. And
then it goes back to a different

4e1d967e-b133-494f-9c2d-b46f6a66c6c7-4
01:26:26.894 --> 01:26:32.146
bedroom where there is a looks
like a cat lying on the bed and

4e1d967e-b133-494f-9c2d-b46f6a66c6c7-5
01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:34.729
then behind that is a bathroom.

827d506e-790b-450a-85cb-b1996dc59db2-0
01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:36.980


c698604a-e4b2-4fd5-b06b-8867f9a38af4-0
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:40.890
OK, so now we

842c00f5-dda1-46b2-afa2-0b0e5fb47a60-0
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:47.991
Have on the left hand side the
father with no nothing about the

842c00f5-dda1-46b2-afa2-0b0e5fb47a60-1
01:26:47.991 --> 01:26:53.457
room anymore. You're not seeing
the room anymore, but you see

842c00f5-dda1-46b2-afa2-0b0e5fb47a60-2
01:26:53.457 --> 01:26:58.481
the father looking down where
the kite, the red kite has

842c00f5-dda1-46b2-afa2-0b0e5fb47a60-3
01:26:58.481 --> 01:27:04.299
fallen on the floor where it was
hanging before and he gets down,

842c00f5-dda1-46b2-afa2-0b0e5fb47a60-4
01:27:04.299 --> 01:27:06.680
picks up the kite and then.

7caf716d-ccdd-426c-85fb-74da96edee43-0
01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:07.910
Um.

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-0
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:13.535
Leaves the kite on the floor and
disappears out of the room. On

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-1
01:27:13.535 --> 01:27:18.480
the right hand side we see that
he has gone into the girls room

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-2
01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.425
and sees that the door that she
drew with her crayon has become

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-3
01:27:23.425 --> 01:27:28.216
a real door and that she is out
the door. You see him looking

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-4
01:27:28.216 --> 01:27:32.930
out the door so he steps through
the door and is now in this

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-5
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:37.643
Wonderland of magic that the
girl has created with beautiful

7dc6a28b-9ee5-4ecf-80b9-b559875faf50-6
01:27:37.643 --> 01:27:38.879
yellow lanterns.

6477fca1-698c-4018-b019-9dfab4112630-0
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:45.253
And lights hanging from the
trees in this forested area with

6477fca1-698c-4018-b019-9dfab4112630-1
01:27:45.253 --> 01:27:51.950
a dock next to a stream and the
red ball is sitting on the dock.

f43d7843-e344-4080-988d-0990f5cc2140-0
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.622
So he goes to the dock and picks
up the red ball and as he does,

f43d7843-e344-4080-988d-0990f5cc2140-1
01:28:01.622 --> 01:28:02.660
he sees this

9057ea22-3c56-4fdf-ab3c-2ebbf19cd857-0
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.470
Boat

8921ebcd-bf7d-473d-a910-2ff91df30d8a-0
01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:10.999
With a fan tail and an animal
head coming toward him, and the

8921ebcd-bf7d-473d-a910-2ff91df30d8a-1
01:28:10.999 --> 01:28:15.868
next picture is three a series
of three where he waits on the

8921ebcd-bf7d-473d-a910-2ff91df30d8a-2
01:28:15.868 --> 01:28:20.894
dock, the boat comes up to him,
he steadies himself and decides

8921ebcd-bf7d-473d-a910-2ff91df30d8a-3
01:28:20.894 --> 01:28:25.606
he's going to get on the boat
and the next one you see that

8921ebcd-bf7d-473d-a910-2ff91df30d8a-4
01:28:25.606 --> 01:28:30.710
he's on the boat heading toward
the front of the boat and he has

8921ebcd-bf7d-473d-a910-2ff91df30d8a-5
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.359
the ball in his hand.

6e363651-7b70-4bee-a153-a5550f574de7-0
01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:43.061
This is an all color picture on
both sides of the page and 1st

6e363651-7b70-4bee-a153-a5550f574de7-1
01:28:43.061 --> 01:28:50.276
you see the father carrying the
red ball peering up into this

6e363651-7b70-4bee-a153-a5550f574de7-2
01:28:50.276 --> 01:28:57.956
city with arches and castle type
towers and that's where the boat

6e363651-7b70-4bee-a153-a5550f574de7-3
01:28:57.956 --> 01:29:03.310
is heading and it's going under
an arch so he

022671f3-7892-40ce-8340-581ea0c9f706-0
01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:09.185
is looking up and the next
picture you see a red little

022671f3-7892-40ce-8340-581ea0c9f706-1
01:29:09.185 --> 01:29:15.384
boat crossing over an archway,
but you don't see the animal

022671f3-7892-40ce-8340-581ea0c9f706-2
01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:21.997
boat anymore and it's a moonlit
night and there is some sort of

022671f3-7892-40ce-8340-581ea0c9f706-3
01:29:21.997 --> 01:29:26.440
blue roofed pagoda on the right
hand side.

a3cc18c2-715f-404f-881a-36e4bb4652d3-0
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:41.601
OK, so the girl was in the boat
and she has gotten out of the

a3cc18c2-715f-404f-881a-36e4bb4652d3-1
01:29:41.601 --> 01:29:45.990
boat near that Blue Pagoda and
we see

229607cb-21e9-427d-b5de-230f365c3e38-0
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:53.560
the key a king and a boy with a
crown on his head and the purple

229607cb-21e9-427d-b5de-230f365c3e38-1
01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:58.997
bird that is familiar from the
other stories like this. And so

229607cb-21e9-427d-b5de-230f365c3e38-2
01:29:58.997 --> 01:30:04.521
the dad reaches the dock where
her boat is and he jumps off the

229607cb-21e9-427d-b5de-230f365c3e38-3
01:30:04.521 --> 01:30:10.045
boat after the girl leaves the
ball on the boat and races after

229607cb-21e9-427d-b5de-230f365c3e38-4
01:30:10.045 --> 01:30:15.655
her as she's going up the stairs
to the king and the boy and the

229607cb-21e9-427d-b5de-230f365c3e38-5
01:30:15.655 --> 01:30:17.899
purple bird by the pagoda.

db1aa0af-083f-42dd-8743-f69f99e39063-0
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:23.160
There are some onlookers on the
other side, and some

2c6d1409-2496-4dad-9706-4b0cde4ee027-0
01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:29.490
Looks like band members with
horns or

02fd4a9d-b790-47a0-9144-930e18ca0f14-0
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:35.373
Yeah, they are on the right hand
side. So then in the next

02fd4a9d-b790-47a0-9144-930e18ca0f14-1
01:30:35.373 --> 01:30:37.370
picture you see the father.

478dbf51-12b8-4cc3-a164-2818289648de-0
01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.570
Approaching the king who has
turned his head.

2395115e-7d37-4e2b-a8af-154f98ef91f3-0
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:48.312
Along with the boy to look at
the girl who is standing with

2395115e-7d37-4e2b-a8af-154f98ef91f3-1
01:30:48.312 --> 01:30:53.701
her arms crossed in front of the
throne, but looking at it kind

2395115e-7d37-4e2b-a8af-154f98ef91f3-2
01:30:53.701 --> 01:30:53.870
of

7fee5d0d-f021-4811-9213-6bba1a50ebee-0
01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:01.230
With an attitude and not
sitting, a haughty attitude.

c6b10d39-8e49-4e55-84f5-550317fb9809-0
01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:09.805
OK then we have all colors. In
the next picture the Purple Bird

c6b10d39-8e49-4e55-84f5-550317fb9809-1
01:31:09.805 --> 01:31:15.500
is flying above and we see this
from the area of the throne and

c6b10d39-8e49-4e55-84f5-550317fb9809-2
01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:20.572
the king has his hand on the
boy. The girl still has the

c6b10d39-8e49-4e55-84f5-550317fb9809-3
01:31:20.572 --> 01:31:26.356
crayon in her hand and the dad,
all of them are facing where the

c6b10d39-8e49-4e55-84f5-550317fb9809-4
01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:31.963
stairs were that she came, they
came up and you see coming out

c6b10d39-8e49-4e55-84f5-550317fb9809-5
01:31:31.963 --> 01:31:33.120
of the animal

e40f3036-37f9-454a-bd92-0cffe0150ca1-0
01:31:33.190 --> 01:31:38.246
boat some guards and and the
next picture you see three

e40f3036-37f9-454a-bd92-0cffe0150ca1-1
01:31:38.246 --> 01:31:43.573
guards running up the stairs and
the king apparently has a

e40f3036-37f9-454a-bd92-0cffe0150ca1-2
01:31:43.573 --> 01:31:48.720
crayon. Also the boy has a
purple crayon, the girl has a

e40f3036-37f9-454a-bd92-0cffe0150ca1-3
01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.227
red crayon, and now we see that
it looks like the king has a

e40f3036-37f9-454a-bd92-0cffe0150ca1-4
01:31:54.227 --> 01:31:54.860
crayon.

c06ba971-91f7-426d-9f60-7976245f9b18-0
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:56.250
OK.

b8c461ac-49f0-4c76-8d64-48b99ecb567e-0
01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:04.365
So the king takes his orange
crayon and draws a straight line

b8c461ac-49f0-4c76-8d64-48b99ecb567e-1
01:32:04.365 --> 01:32:09.875
while these guards are
approaching and this straight

b8c461ac-49f0-4c76-8d64-48b99ecb567e-2
01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:12.369
line turns into a sword.

3bf2b0b4-1403-460b-be80-9151790e5f32-0
01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.570
And the

54fc182e-e994-4764-a018-2a81ecd75fc5-0
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:24.587
I can't tell and this doesn't
look like a I guess it is a

54fc182e-e994-4764-a018-2a81ecd75fc5-1
01:32:24.587 --> 01:32:30.816
guard. He has a helmet on, so
the guard comes in and it looks

54fc182e-e994-4764-a018-2a81ecd75fc5-2
01:32:30.816 --> 01:32:33.830
like what he has a device that

9aa9a11b-3f89-4dbf-9e8e-6cd314ab47a8-0
01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:37.880
Throws things at the

29b493a9-6569-4109-a3b1-0d5bdfc2f3e3-0
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:44.205
sword and cuts it in half. So
it's an attack of some sort, and

29b493a9-6569-4109-a3b1-0d5bdfc2f3e3-1
01:32:44.205 --> 01:32:49.491
he gets the King's sword out of
his hand and breaks it up. And

29b493a9-6569-4109-a3b1-0d5bdfc2f3e3-2
01:32:49.491 --> 01:32:50.330
then those

9d9fe77a-63ca-416e-9910-942da41bddcb-0
01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:56.554
Not the guy with the helmet on
his head, but two other guards

9d9fe77a-63ca-416e-9910-942da41bddcb-1
01:32:56.554 --> 01:33:01.456
take the king and the the helmet
guy runs away with the device

9d9fe77a-63ca-416e-9910-942da41bddcb-2
01:33:01.456 --> 01:33:04.180
that he has and he and the king
is

c2ed7422-1df1-426e-83e9-e97dcfbf6429-0
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:06.290
Reaching out toward him.

cb58661d-385b-4a5f-a42e-26a5db041bc9-0
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:14.280
So the next picture we see

3af20018-4439-4e00-b7d8-0634b60cf8eb-0
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.230
The father, the daughter,

38312777-3a09-4857-9d06-04738193af16-0
01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:25.324
The boy with a crown on his
head, and the purple bird with

38312777-3a09-4857-9d06-04738193af16-1
01:33:25.324 --> 01:33:26.560
the girl and

b2e17670-9fb1-4260-8aa3-1968cf96fad4-0
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:32.301
Behind them is coming the man
with a helmet on his head and

b2e17670-9fb1-4260-8aa3-1968cf96fad4-1
01:33:32.301 --> 01:33:37.563
that device in his hand. While
this is happening, the boy with

b2e17670-9fb1-4260-8aa3-1968cf96fad4-2
01:33:37.563 --> 01:33:41.740
the purple crayon is drawing
what turns out to be

4565b140-bd97-493a-b3d3-14ba3f51a2d2-0
01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:48.217
Like a Pegasus? That would would
be like a flying horse that

4565b140-bd97-493a-b3d3-14ba3f51a2d2-1
01:33:48.217 --> 01:33:50.050
takes them all away.

1f542ac0-27fe-4d53-9ee7-22cfb6e87b76-0
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:55.373
Uh, the three of them away from
the person who was after the

1f542ac0-27fe-4d53-9ee7-22cfb6e87b76-1
01:33:55.373 --> 01:33:59.636
helmeted guy. I mean from the
helmeted guy and down below it

1f542ac0-27fe-4d53-9ee7-22cfb6e87b76-2
01:33:59.636 --> 01:34:03.481
appears that there were some
other people on a rock or

1f542ac0-27fe-4d53-9ee7-22cfb6e87b76-3
01:34:03.481 --> 01:34:04.179
something.

1130de61-e7a4-479f-9186-56d088ca53fd-0
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.010
Now we see from above, we see
the purple

637dd0eb-d22c-47a0-8a6d-40bbb641594d-0
01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:18.004
Purple Flying horse with the
three people on it and the boys

637dd0eb-d22c-47a0-8a6d-40bbb641594d-1
01:34:18.004 --> 01:34:23.570
crayon appears to be lost out of
his hand. It doesn't look like

637dd0eb-d22c-47a0-8a6d-40bbb641594d-2
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:29.222
he's throwing it. Looks like he
lost it, like it flew out of his

637dd0eb-d22c-47a0-8a6d-40bbb641594d-3
01:34:29.222 --> 01:34:31.310
hand. And so we see that

cebd2f0c-1c17-4c83-b68e-5bd6e1e58a50-0
01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:38.044
The helmeted guy is down there.
He might be doing some of that.

cebd2f0c-1c17-4c83-b68e-5bd6e1e58a50-1
01:34:38.044 --> 01:34:42.651
He might be trying to make these
things leave because there's

cebd2f0c-1c17-4c83-b68e-5bd6e1e58a50-2
01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:47.257
purple coming out of his device
now and the animal boat is in

cebd2f0c-1c17-4c83-b68e-5bd6e1e58a50-3
01:34:47.257 --> 01:34:52.012
the background with the guards
holding the king, and down below

cebd2f0c-1c17-4c83-b68e-5bd6e1e58a50-4
01:34:52.012 --> 01:34:55.949
is just more of that castle area
and a lot of water.

89b0a5ad-f326-4795-906b-5a2c496a0cf4-0
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:58.600
And on the right

175a9991-c0ad-4f24-a164-c710c2d681a0-0
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.850
On the right hand side down in
the water is a rock with a

175a9991-c0ad-4f24-a164-c710c2d681a0-1
01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:08.137
windmill. It must be a house or
two that I thought was people

175a9991-c0ad-4f24-a164-c710c2d681a0-2
01:35:08.137 --> 01:35:09.590
before, but it's not.

b91b8cf9-06b9-4e26-a08f-4c46697cd207-0
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.810
Ohh.

296a3b58-1f2e-40e5-a654-75c8d979207f-0
01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.960
So now we see.

bae713ac-3a33-41ad-b765-33dcf99102b0-0
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.810
The animal boat

aa10f9e6-ac91-4b50-96d2-9eb8fd57d54c-0
01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:33.652
is flying and the man with the
helmet is releasing all of these

aa10f9e6-ac91-4b50-96d2-9eb8fd57d54c-1
01:35:33.652 --> 01:35:39.246
purple feathers that are causing
problems and the king and the

aa10f9e6-ac91-4b50-96d2-9eb8fd57d54c-2
01:35:39.246 --> 01:35:44.929
two guards are in that boat with
the helmet person and the king

aa10f9e6-ac91-4b50-96d2-9eb8fd57d54c-3
01:35:44.929 --> 01:35:50.257
reached out to grab the boy who
had been thrown. Apparently

aa10f9e6-ac91-4b50-96d2-9eb8fd57d54c-4
01:35:50.257 --> 01:35:55.141
these feathers are are causing
problems or maybe it it

aa10f9e6-ac91-4b50-96d2-9eb8fd57d54c-5
01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:58.160
destroyed the bird. I can't
tell.

82df7d58-0468-43f1-acce-e2b82c10ba5e-0
01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:01.822
But the father and the girl and
the next picture are just

82df7d58-0468-43f1-acce-e2b82c10ba5e-1
01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:05.355
floating, like they're flying
through the air. They don't know

82df7d58-0468-43f1-acce-e2b82c10ba5e-2
01:36:05.355 --> 01:36:08.888
what's going to happen to him,
but she has the purple bird and

82df7d58-0468-43f1-acce-e2b82c10ba5e-3
01:36:08.888 --> 01:36:09.729
her red crayon.

8584ca89-0d5e-4d39-87b5-51ddc158315c-0
01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:18.199
So the father and the girl and
the purple bird fall into the

8584ca89-0d5e-4d39-87b5-51ddc158315c-1
01:36:18.199 --> 01:36:22.040
water and you see some fish and
her crown falls off.

08b272aa-1715-4912-972f-de8251c55f3f-0
01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:27.300
And then while she's in the
water

545adede-e239-4563-9dff-c54d287dfe11-0
01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:32.857
She uses her red crayon and
draws a shape around the three

545adede-e239-4563-9dff-c54d287dfe11-1
01:36:32.857 --> 01:36:37.845
of them. The purple bird and the
dad and her that is on the next

545adede-e239-4563-9dff-c54d287dfe11-2
01:36:37.845 --> 01:36:42.526
page is probably going to turn
into something that will help

545adede-e239-4563-9dff-c54d287dfe11-3
01:36:42.526 --> 01:36:42.910
them.

d0254771-0118-4dc8-b9c7-e1e10dabd6fd-0
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:49.020
And there it is. It's some sort
of.

ad1a7e58-e092-4c48-871d-52a0f85c9b7d-0
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:56.400
Submarine, vehicle and on the
left hand side you see.

e15d5dc6-7a33-46dd-b23c-87b969dfb432-0
01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:04.188
A mountain growing out of the
water with everything in color

e15d5dc6-7a33-46dd-b23c-87b969dfb432-1
01:37:04.188 --> 01:37:10.134
now, it's beautiful and the
father and the daughter are in

e15d5dc6-7a33-46dd-b23c-87b969dfb432-2
01:37:10.134 --> 01:37:10.840
the red

75eb56e7-20a7-46bf-b49f-e2a6cb6da3cc-0
01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:15.808
Submarine looks like the father
is sitting down driving it and

75eb56e7-20a7-46bf-b49f-e2a6cb6da3cc-1
01:37:15.808 --> 01:37:18.530
the girl is peering through the
Periscope.

196bfe2c-655b-4ff8-afae-d1c25af21589-0
01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:25.330
So you see the

daf3fddb-f974-4838-86da-0c041fb5d282-0
01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:33.520
Submarine surfacing in a big
cave area and

7801668b-f893-4952-a26e-8e017acd4609-0
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.090
I can't tell what's all over the
walls. Maybe it's drawings?

fbf44849-37a7-4c4d-be2a-80b20cccea3c-0
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:47.677
Like you might find in caves,
but there's a lot of things all

fbf44849-37a7-4c4d-be2a-80b20cccea3c-1
01:37:47.677 --> 01:37:51.607
over there. Maybe they'll become
real, I don't know. But at any

fbf44849-37a7-4c4d-be2a-80b20cccea3c-2
01:37:51.607 --> 01:37:55.108
rate, now the father and
daughter and purple bird are on

fbf44849-37a7-4c4d-be2a-80b20cccea3c-3
01:37:55.108 --> 01:37:58.240
the top of the submarine in this
underground cave.

3a8953e8-b04e-4db3-8230-548126a5cf85-0
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:07.840
So she's pointing in the Cave at
this

1e3fcb69-c53e-4c2e-b0ed-3731aaf0ecd5-0
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:15.622
And these drawings that appear
to be on the wall and behind her

1e3fcb69-c53e-4c2e-b0ed-3731aaf0ecd5-1
01:38:15.622 --> 01:38:21.057
is a column that is obviously
been fashioned by a human. And

1e3fcb69-c53e-4c2e-b0ed-3731aaf0ecd5-2
01:38:21.057 --> 01:38:26.136
over to the left there is a
precipice of rock that has a

1e3fcb69-c53e-4c2e-b0ed-3731aaf0ecd5-3
01:38:26.136 --> 01:38:31.749
little door underneath it. And
then on the right hand side you

1e3fcb69-c53e-4c2e-b0ed-3731aaf0ecd5-4
01:38:31.749 --> 01:38:36.650
see as they would look out of
this cave that it's just

7fad1310-647a-48a6-a00d-1fe92486d84c-0
01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:44.398
it is, It's on open water, but
you see the shadow on the wall

7fad1310-647a-48a6-a00d-1fe92486d84c-1
01:38:44.398 --> 01:38:50.260
of the animal boat, so it's they
must be coming toward them.

e670964d-6ad3-4dc8-bb5c-6e5977fc6899-0
01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.079
So then we're still inside The
Cave with the father and the

e670964d-6ad3-4dc8-bb5c-6e5977fc6899-1
01:38:58.079 --> 01:39:02.404
girl and the purple bird. They
are looking, peering out at

e670964d-6ad3-4dc8-bb5c-6e5977fc6899-2
01:39:02.404 --> 01:39:06.950
those who are coming out of the
animal boat, the guy with the

e670964d-6ad3-4dc8-bb5c-6e5977fc6899-3
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:09.590
helmet and that device in his
hand.

9e665d09-355c-4c87-a10b-f86a4ffa4b4b-0
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:14.420
And so then you see the father

b036c791-2c38-4d3c-a9cb-86718d4e1908-0
01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:20.537
has a crayon, looks like a black
crayon, and he is drawing he.

b036c791-2c38-4d3c-a9cb-86718d4e1908-1
01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:24.669
He's going to draw something.
He's pointing at the purple

b036c791-2c38-4d3c-a9cb-86718d4e1908-2
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:29.085
bird. So he draws something and
we find out that it is a cage

b036c791-2c38-4d3c-a9cb-86718d4e1908-3
01:39:29.085 --> 01:39:30.510
for the purple bird.

76df6e75-38dd-4c52-aa78-de3cf02910d3-0
01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.118
Maybe in a doorway, but the bird
is now in a cage. The dad is

76df6e75-38dd-4c52-aa78-de3cf02910d3-1
01:39:35.118 --> 01:39:36.480
finishing his drawing.

857d51da-4dd4-45fc-84fb-d2d4777048a8-0
01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:42.630
Ah.

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-0
01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:47.516
It does. It is a cage with the
bird in it. But it also is

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-1
01:39:47.516 --> 01:39:51.781
created to have doors that will
fold up like it's a trap and

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-2
01:39:51.781 --> 01:39:55.837
will catch the person who's
coming after the purple bird,

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-3
01:39:55.837 --> 01:39:59.963
the guy with the helmet. So he
runs up the ramp to get the

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-4
01:39:59.963 --> 01:40:04.159
purple bird, and his device
flies out of his hand as all of

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-5
01:40:04.159 --> 01:40:08.355
the trapdoors begin to fold up.
And now he's in a cage. The

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-6
01:40:08.355 --> 01:40:12.551
father has the device in his
hand. He looks like he's going

f36db23a-68ef-44ec-be38-9068ed9c8a07-7
01:40:12.551 --> 01:40:14.369
to throw it on the ground.

09fc3cc2-1516-40eb-9d5b-d86a0419504a-0
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.110
To smash it and

fd960c97-6477-4c0e-82fa-073282a4f2ce-0
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:19.910
The girl is yelling.

fa8b03ad-0d86-4eeb-9eeb-bb5912400a74-0
01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:33.446
Ah, so all the things that were
captured by that device, it was

fa8b03ad-0d86-4eeb-9eeb-bb5912400a74-1
01:40:33.446 --> 01:40:35.770
probably like a vacuum.

dc291623-d079-48df-a8ed-9f54012250d7-0
01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:44.615
When the father throws it down,
it explodes and the purple

dc291623-d079-48df-a8ed-9f54012250d7-1
01:40:44.615 --> 01:40:46.050
flying horse

fb65f566-c164-4443-a653-f55862f474e1-0
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:52.929
Comes back out of it and the
purple bird comes out of it, and

fb65f566-c164-4443-a653-f55862f474e1-1
01:40:52.929 --> 01:40:57.702
all these gorgeous rainbow
colors come out of it with

fb65f566-c164-4443-a653-f55862f474e1-2
01:40:57.702 --> 01:41:03.182
butterflies and and dragonflies.
And the boy and the king are

fb65f566-c164-4443-a653-f55862f474e1-3
01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:08.927
running toward the inside of the
cave where the dad and the girl

fb65f566-c164-4443-a653-f55862f474e1-4
01:41:08.927 --> 01:41:13.169
are. The helmeted guy is still
trapped, and the

c61830d8-2025-4b48-8fba-925d13fd943c-0
01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.780
Animal boat with the two guards
on it

d3cb266f-4d0f-471e-bfd6-b8c38803c60d-0
01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.850
is outside the cave, but the
guards drop their swords and and

d3cb266f-4d0f-471e-bfd6-b8c38803c60d-1
01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:27.080
it looks like the explosion
frightened them.

dae9cf3d-f1a9-4c6d-bf6e-dc1bbbbcf766-0
01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:37.742
So then we see the cave with the
king and the boy and the purple

dae9cf3d-f1a9-4c6d-bf6e-dc1bbbbcf766-1
01:41:37.742 --> 01:41:39.190
bird and the dad

a4553b74-cff0-4155-b02c-c1893af86e2e-0
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.700
And the girl and

83e6b575-b306-4c95-ac70-e97cd5af8b10-0
01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:46.430
I do not see.

e6106666-5b16-453e-8a82-fb76748b1c02-0
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:53.631
I do not see the guy in the
helmet anymore, but the the

e6106666-5b16-453e-8a82-fb76748b1c02-1
01:41:53.631 --> 01:41:59.434
guards are taking that animal
boat away. Oh yes, I do see it.

e6106666-5b16-453e-8a82-fb76748b1c02-2
01:41:59.434 --> 01:42:05.424
It's up in the air. So the the
purple flying horse took the the

e6106666-5b16-453e-8a82-fb76748b1c02-3
01:42:05.424 --> 01:42:11.320
trap with the guy in it and is
flying away and the animal boat

e6106666-5b16-453e-8a82-fb76748b1c02-4
01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:16.842
is taking the bad guards away
and everything is colorfully

e6106666-5b16-453e-8a82-fb76748b1c02-5
01:42:16.842 --> 01:42:18.339
happy with birds

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-0
01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:23.340
All the colors of the rainbow as
the those people, the bad people

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-1
01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.972
left and the good people are
there. So then on the right hand

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-2
01:42:27.972 --> 01:42:32.230
side we see that the girl is
thankful for to her dad for

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-3
01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:37.086
coming. The king and the boy and
the bird are just fine watching

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-4
01:42:37.086 --> 01:42:41.493
them, and the door under the
precipice turns out to be the

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-5
01:42:41.493 --> 01:42:45.901
door that goes back into her
house because you see the red

aa938282-b2a5-42e7-becc-7981830681fa-6
01:42:45.901 --> 01:42:46.200
kite

246e4c47-59ac-4ba0-8163-b09aa2c80628-0
01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.730
Tail coming out of it.

8ab23db6-2ad6-4e54-a5b5-105698082ff4-0
01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:59.120
The last { is this, the last
picture. } The last picture

8ab23db6-2ad6-4e54-a5b5-105698082ff4-1
01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.859
shows the kite flying outside of
the girl's house and the

8ab23db6-2ad6-4e54-a5b5-105698082ff4-2
01:43:04.859 --> 01:43:05.749
trapdoor.

504ba25f-5d9c-4b30-bc75-48a73c2bff03-0
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:12.064
Um goes into the
dad's office and so that door is

504ba25f-5d9c-4b30-bc75-48a73c2bff03-1
01:43:12.064 --> 01:43:17.708
still open and everything is
bright and cheerful, and they're

504ba25f-5d9c-4b30-bc75-48a73c2bff03-2
01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:23.080
back home. #END_return All right, so we're
overtime and we have one.

9b52ec59-7a41-4e21-aa8c-087b34ab8cca-0
01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:28.998
Complex scene left of the whole
study. Would you have time to do

9b52ec59-7a41-4e21-aa8c-087b34ab8cca-1
01:43:28.998 --> 01:43:33.685
this? Sure. That means that we
will be done. We will be done,

9b52ec59-7a41-4e21-aa8c-087b34ab8cca-2
01:43:33.685 --> 01:43:38.069
yes. Yeah, sure. Why not? That's
easier than us trying to

9b52ec59-7a41-4e21-aa8c-087b34ab8cca-3
01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:41.319

last one.

01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:42.760
Yeah.

af42c16e-a3a0-4679-9b8d-23b2ae9b6bb7-0
01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:50.224
#START_wild_west The wild, Wild
West. I knew that right away

af42c16e-a3a0-4679-9b8d-23b2ae9b6bb7-1
01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:52.600
because the first word I saw was
saloon.

392f5ac4-3b18-4594-914d-9e0fa4a11ee2-0
01:43:54.250 --> 01:44:01.685
So up at the top we have a hotel
and a saloon and this is a multi

392f5ac4-3b18-4594-914d-9e0fa4a11ee2-1
01:44:01.685 --> 01:44:08.444
layered picture of a Wild West
town from above. we have the

392f5ac4-3b18-4594-914d-9e0fa4a11ee2-2
01:44:08.444 --> 01:44:10.360
Wild West saloon.

0fc94fa9-efaf-45ea-b9cf-c9587ee44cc6-0
01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:11.890
We have

f179257e-13c0-4b56-9f18-172db308030e-0
01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:19.276
Is that another? Yeah, another
hotel and saloon and a general

f179257e-13c0-4b56-9f18-172db308030e-1
01:44:19.276 --> 01:44:25.440
store and a jail and a bank and
the pioneer saloon and another

f179257e-13c0-4b56-9f18-172db308030e-2
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:31.702
saloon and the livery stable and
livery unstable. That's funny.

f179257e-13c0-4b56-9f18-172db308030e-3
01:44:31.702 --> 01:44:34.540
And one more saloon, it says.

561b939c-b46c-4c30-b149-e3313e21ee77-0
01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:38.890
{That's funny. Good, good.}

ec4fb125-6e8f-437f-a507-10e4b6e5dc2a-0
01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:47.153
So yeah, this is a place where
everybody can get a taste of

ec4fb125-6e8f-437f-a507-10e4b6e5dc2a-1
01:44:47.153 --> 01:44:53.585
what the Wild West was like and
this is absolutely crazy. You

ec4fb125-6e8f-437f-a507-10e4b6e5dc2a-2
01:44:53.585 --> 01:44:59.808
see the train and the very right
hand side red steam engine

ec4fb125-6e8f-437f-a507-10e4b6e5dc2a-3
01:44:59.808 --> 01:45:00.950
pulling in.

3ba56629-af46-4e76-8067-edd510650f6f-0
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:06.630
And people getting ready to get
off. There's a Stagecoach there

3ba56629-af46-4e76-8067-edd510650f6f-1
01:45:06.630 --> 01:45:09.530
too, so that's where all the
action is.

4c74859b-abf4-4e0c-9fc4-bf2d13e71b5f-0
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:17.946
You see that everything you
would expect in a Western is

4c74859b-abf4-4e0c-9fc4-bf2d13e71b5f-1
01:45:17.946 --> 01:45:22.460
there. You've got Stagecoach.
You have

e23ac58b-431e-43aa-bdff-fd06b8c0263e-0
01:45:23.970 --> 01:45:28.218
Let me go around here. You have
the saloons, you have people

e23ac58b-431e-43aa-bdff-fd06b8c0263e-1
01:45:28.218 --> 01:45:32.606
dressed like Cowboys, you have
bank robbers on in front of the

e23ac58b-431e-43aa-bdff-fd06b8c0263e-2
01:45:32.606 --> 01:45:35.950
pioneer saloon. They're running
away with masks

2d6bdd26-03d9-40d9-a758-4e1627db9302-0
01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:44.343
pulled over their faces and bags
of money and then up above that

2d6bdd26-03d9-40d9-a758-4e1627db9302-1
01:45:44.343 --> 01:45:45.880
it looks like

d79b2ce8-ad89-4c29-8523-124cf4d48c89-0
01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.930
Gold that has fallen out of
something, but

a7552421-8233-4d93-b60b-3b0dedfdbe48-0
01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:56.669
And then you have the livery
stable with the horses in it and

a7552421-8233-4d93-b60b-3b0dedfdbe48-1
01:45:56.669 --> 01:46:01.808
over to the right looks like a
bunch of doctors in white coats,

a7552421-8233-4d93-b60b-3b0dedfdbe48-2
01:46:01.808 --> 01:46:07.028
so maybe they came for a visit.
And then above that, at the very

a7552421-8233-4d93-b60b-3b0dedfdbe48-3
01:46:07.028 --> 01:46:11.927
top, you see a pink and yellow
sunset and the Cowboys riding

a7552421-8233-4d93-b60b-3b0dedfdbe48-4
01:46:11.927 --> 01:46:16.504
off into the sunset in the
desert. So they must be doing

a7552421-8233-4d93-b60b-3b0dedfdbe48-5
01:46:16.504 --> 01:46:17.870
that as part of a

e74a3203-a8ad-4b65-8388-c919ed393322-0
01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:24.710
Uh, production, a presentation
at that. back on the other side

2b04beb1-a213-4945-b243-71476c60c744-0
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.204
Yeah, at the top, by the saloon,
you see the sheriff trying to

2b04beb1-a213-4945-b243-71476c60c744-1
01:46:31.204 --> 01:46:36.078
arrest someone who's running
away with a bag of money. You

2b04beb1-a213-4945-b243-71476c60c744-2
01:46:36.078 --> 01:46:41.199
see the Conestoga, or covered
wagons driving down the street.

eda379fe-f74a-470a-81c1-7171270151c1-0
01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:47.486
You see a gold mine, a gold
mine, and a gold yours. That's

eda379fe-f74a-470a-81c1-7171270151c1-1
01:46:47.486 --> 01:46:52.214
funny. So yeah, I mean, they're
obviously making a fun time of

eda379fe-f74a-470a-81c1-7171270151c1-2
01:46:52.214 --> 01:46:56.866
this and knowing that people
want to see what they expect the

eda379fe-f74a-470a-81c1-7171270151c1-3
01:46:56.866 --> 01:47:00.917
Wild West to be, but on the
other hand, it was really

eda379fe-f74a-470a-81c1-7171270151c1-4
01:47:00.917 --> 01:47:05.570
nothing like that. So they're
making making a joke of it too.

805b8063-ede6-4163-8505-85e61481011d-0
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.756
Looks like maybe, uh, there was
a fight in this hotel because

805b8063-ede6-4163-8505-85e61481011d-1
01:47:11.756 --> 01:47:16.206
the tables are overturned and
some of the people look like

805b8063-ede6-4163-8505-85e61481011d-2
01:47:16.206 --> 01:47:17.790
they're running away.

8300a04b-5ac1-4123-941d-9b8a10f83e48-0
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:24.929
Uh, yeah. Somebody's falling
down the stairs in that hotel.

8300a04b-5ac1-4123-941d-9b8a10f83e48-1
01:47:24.929 --> 01:47:29.177
Maybe they were shoved down the
stairs. Somebody's trying to

8300a04b-5ac1-4123-941d-9b8a10f83e48-2
01:47:29.177 --> 01:47:33.078
break out of jail by going
through the chimney. There's

8300a04b-5ac1-4123-941d-9b8a10f83e48-3
01:47:33.078 --> 01:47:34.680
there's wanted posters.

70ed3773-55d9-4279-b272-3dfaabfc7e4d-0
01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:40.093
There's Buffalo on stamps
instead, like a Stampede. A

70ed3773-55d9-4279-b272-3dfaabfc7e4d-1
01:47:40.093 --> 01:47:45.428
Buffalo Stampede. And so they
have buffaloes on stamps going

70ed3773-55d9-4279-b272-3dfaabfc7e4d-2
01:47:45.428 --> 01:47:50.676
through, going through the
street. That's really funny. And

70ed3773-55d9-4279-b272-3dfaabfc7e4d-3
01:47:50.676 --> 01:47:56.099
then you have a horse who is
painting a painting of a covered

70ed3773-55d9-4279-b272-3dfaabfc7e4d-4
01:47:56.099 --> 01:48:01.610
wagon, and everywhere you look
there's Cowboys and cowboy hats

70ed3773-55d9-4279-b272-3dfaabfc7e4d-5
01:48:01.610 --> 01:48:01.959
and.

82252936-98cf-4d0e-9643-88d453df8a07-0
01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:08.050
You know, even people drinking
too much outside the saloon and

82252936-98cf-4d0e-9643-88d453df8a07-1
01:48:08.050 --> 01:48:12.800
people watching and there are
some film films going on because

82252936-98cf-4d0e-9643-88d453df8a07-2
01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.551
they are making a movie. So up
where the sunset is, you've got

82252936-98cf-4d0e-9643-88d453df8a07-3
01:48:17.551 --> 01:48:22.452
someone taking pictures. And on
the top of the hotel sign in red

82252936-98cf-4d0e-9643-88d453df8a07-4
01:48:22.452 --> 01:48:27.354
you have people taking pictures,
the movie people. And there was

82252936-98cf-4d0e-9643-88d453df8a07-5
01:48:27.354 --> 01:48:29.390
one other thing that I saw.

2009ec19-4183-4b28-9dbb-46e67fb1a8ca-0
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.290
But I don't remember what it
was.

9cd8e7e0-74f1-4505-9431-ba0d556873d2-0
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:37.784
But that's OK ohh yeah. Up at
the top, the top saloon on the

9cd8e7e0-74f1-4505-9431-ba0d556873d2-1
01:48:37.784 --> 01:48:42.150
right, that's a whole red
background. You've got people

9cd8e7e0-74f1-4505-9431-ba0d556873d2-2
01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:47.138
playing music, fiddles and and a
piano and a banjo. And so that

9cd8e7e0-74f1-4505-9431-ba0d556873d2-3
01:48:47.138 --> 01:48:48.620
was the last thing.

98a9c6e1-675d-4d10-be87-8351980cf6d9-0
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:50.030
That I see. #END_wild_west 

0935c882-3d58-4f1b-ba29-8d1a4de652ac-0
01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.220
This 4 minutes we are all done.
All good.
