00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.763
Here we go. So this next one is
a graphic novel. It's about 20

c0877832-9a3c-4680-9bad-a02782b69620-1
00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:13.229
pages. Um. So again, just
describe what you see and what

c0877832-9a3c-4680-9bad-a02782b69620-2
00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.460
is happening and take between 10
and 15 minutes, OK?

2ceb1b06-4ec8-4342-b8ef-5719e252e1f5-0
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.281
OK, Ohh I'm not so sure. We
might have already seen this

2ceb1b06-4ec8-4342-b8ef-5719e252e1f5-1
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:24.660
one.

8b2cfa87-2600-498e-92ff-18d1c18dbcad-0
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.560
That OK.

86b01ba8-6d45-4e8e-99be-b81542578bf2-0
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.666
Oh, that might be this one
then. Do you remember this? I

86b01ba8-6d45-4e8e-99be-b81542578bf2-1
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.079
think we've done. I think we saw
that one too. Would they go out

86b01ba8-6d45-4e8e-99be-b81542578bf2-2
00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.500
of the?

5147d6f9-c8eb-442a-9812-e40df334ed80-0
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.648
Whatever the arch into the
rainbows, yes, OK, and they both

5147d6f9-c8eb-442a-9812-e40df334ed80-1
00:00:41.648 --> 00:00:44.710
have their crowns from the
Majesty.

ed0160b5-863f-4765-b016-877216573cbd-0
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.088
We'll start here. OK, this
again is a graphic novel, but

ed0160b5-863f-4765-b016-877216573cbd-1
00:00:51.088 --> 00:00:55.450
because it's the longest in the
series, all out of all the

ed0160b5-863f-4765-b016-877216573cbd-2
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.630
items, it will be the longest
you'll see.

e88be20e-e468-41e6-ab2b-e51ee5dbe005-0
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.820
And you may want to pick up the
pace because of that.

a14ca588-8d02-4ef8-9986-113c2d8b9889-0
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.820
#START_wanderer So OK, so this
graphic novel has a

56a161ac-7bfe-4bc7-9156-123bc2a403d1-0
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.410
What can I say? It looks like a.

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-0
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.766
Viking type of individual,
older. He's dressed up as a like

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-1
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:26.409
a Viking with horns. And then
there's another individual who

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-2
00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.203
he's helping. They're going to
fold up a big piece of material

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-3
00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:35.998
and that material is now going
to become a looks like it looks

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-4
00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:40.641
like a hat, but it's actually
somehow on the right hand side

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-5
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:45.207
of this page is going to be a
boat. And so they've prepared

498d3bae-bf33-4787-aeb5-6790872b017d-6
00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:46.729
their, they've gone.

851ab5bf-7d20-422e-94c5-7fadfc25c7a4-0
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.430
About making this.

3453f400-ee9b-4080-a1aa-5c829c0e0425-0
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.658
Together and then we have this
flying ship that is shaped like

3453f400-ee9b-4080-a1aa-5c829c0e0425-1
00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:54.270
a boat.

2be8a796-2566-4683-83f8-0859a0111916-0
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.640
{I'm like wait, wait, wait, wait
all over and I see something

2be8a796-2566-4683-83f8-0859a0111916-1
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.478
else.} I see that little paper
shaped boat that looks like a

2be8a796-2566-4683-83f8-0859a0111916-2
00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:03.729
hat.

6635ad6a-07de-4fa0-a8d4-4dd851f73353-0
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.632
It's ahead of them in the water.
It's either following this big

6635ad6a-07de-4fa0-a8d4-4dd851f73353-1
00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:12.006
ship with these flags on it, or
the ship is following it. I'm

6635ad6a-07de-4fa0-a8d4-4dd851f73353-2
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.435
not sure yet. I think this ship
might be following it, but I'm

6635ad6a-07de-4fa0-a8d4-4dd851f73353-3
00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.830
not sure. Maybe they were trying
to escape.

1e9b32e0-7ac0-45d9-a1e2-a5ef5c8d530a-0
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.780


c8c15a96-f693-45fc-b628-65ba3f782f2a-0
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.928
It'll come together. So now we
have the the paper hat boat in

c8c15a96-f693-45fc-b628-65ba3f782f2a-1
00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:33.266
what looks like water, and above
it you can see there's these

c8c15a96-f693-45fc-b628-65ba3f782f2a-2
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:37.324
birds. They're all in, in
sequence as birds normally are.

c8c15a96-f693-45fc-b628-65ba3f782f2a-3
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:41.383
And we can see that they're
rising because the one on the

c8c15a96-f693-45fc-b628-65ba3f782f2a-4
00:02:41.383 --> 00:02:45.371
top is the largest and the one
on the left bottom is the

c8c15a96-f693-45fc-b628-65ba3f782f2a-5
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:49.430
smallest. So it looks like it's
kind of depicting travel.

1469444f-4b76-48ee-8438-02d3e0728e2f-0
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.479
And um, being led by these
birds, there's this little tiny

1469444f-4b76-48ee-8438-02d3e0728e2f-1
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.920
hat boat is being led by the
birds.

1893efed-f6ae-4771-8e8b-6dbc6851593c-0
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.425
Probably away from that ship.
OK, so now oddly enough the

1893efed-f6ae-4771-8e8b-6dbc6851593c-1
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:07.741
paper boat ship is being
attacked by some kind of

1893efed-f6ae-4771-8e8b-6dbc6851593c-2
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:13.265
amphibian beings. We got a bird,
we got what looks like a funny

1893efed-f6ae-4771-8e8b-6dbc6851593c-3
00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:14.560
looking turtle.

80fbce70-b98e-490b-80f0-1227505bc12e-0
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.071
Just like, uh, how can I
describe an abstract turtle?

80fbce70-b98e-490b-80f0-1227505bc12e-1
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:23.546
It's might be a turtle, but it's
got, it's got other design on it

80fbce70-b98e-490b-80f0-1227505bc12e-2
00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:27.749
than a turtle would. And then
you can see I think it's like a

80fbce70-b98e-490b-80f0-1227505bc12e-3
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.156
really large object is going to
come, a big amphibious object is

80fbce70-b98e-490b-80f0-1227505bc12e-4
00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:36.495
going to come and get in the way
with the little tiny boat too.

80fbce70-b98e-490b-80f0-1227505bc12e-5
00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:39.140
The water's getting a little
choppier.

bf6a2847-84eb-45dd-8201-304d16bc9a1d-0
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.490
There's still some birds. OK, so
now what you can see.

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-0
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.554
Is what's actually happened is
underneath this water. We have

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-1
00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:55.269
an underwater scene now and it's
black and white. By the way.

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-2
00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.136
We've got fishes with Spears and
little tiny fishes. They're on

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-3
00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:04.699
their spear and we've got pools
of of fish and all sorts of

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-4
00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.262
algae and growth that would
probably be really pretty if it

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-5
00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:13.825
was in color. But the main thing
about this picture is that

b1ad5fbd-ed45-4387-af35-a7687c959555-6
00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.269
what's happened is.

97114214-abee-46fd-bcaf-c25c4b0d4215-0
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.400
The little tiny boat.

62ae095e-5ac0-4006-a58e-62f487ef9807-0
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.260
Is really being used as a hat by
a large.

c29edbbb-6c0a-4743-ad9a-97cbd8653a81-0
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.240
Aquatic animal.

f2e9aa18-d9cd-4149-a6b7-afc86f1ab675-0
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.390
And that animal looks like it's
coming towards us, but I'm not

f2e9aa18-d9cd-4149-a6b7-afc86f1ab675-1
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.163
sure. So it's kind of funny.
It's kind of like you can see

f2e9aa18-d9cd-4149-a6b7-afc86f1ab675-2
00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:33.935
the underwater scene and then
we've got this animal large,

f2e9aa18-d9cd-4149-a6b7-afc86f1ab675-3
00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:36.849
maybe a whale or something, and
it's wearing that little tiny

f2e9aa18-d9cd-4149-a6b7-afc86f1ab675-4
00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.340
boat as a hat and it's sticking
up out of the water.

53d069b4-c3fc-4355-a787-8bb052a08e45-0
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.940
And again we see the underwater.

502d39c2-fe23-4a79-901f-b4fd87780ff6-0
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.535
aquatic area with lots of of
fish and yet this is black and

502d39c2-fe23-4a79-901f-b4fd87780ff6-1
00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:54.115
white. It's not color, so it's
it's kind of odd to see

502d39c2-fe23-4a79-901f-b4fd87780ff6-2
00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:58.412
something like this in black and
white. Looks like a sketch. Lots

502d39c2-fe23-4a79-901f-b4fd87780ff6-3
00:04:58.412 --> 00:05:00.300
of fishes and then we've got.

8d030839-c691-4f68-8916-3850f7de1058-0
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.590
The little boat still on top of
the water.

6d0c7545-7c2d-429a-a58d-c3451da23906-0
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.189
But a bunch of fish are on the
top of the water too, so it's

6d0c7545-7c2d-429a-a58d-c3451da23906-1
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.290
kind of probably.

255bcaa7-b58a-4a5c-a390-9a27d91dc5e4-0
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.926
It's not very deep, let's put it
that way. Because it was deep,

255bcaa7-b58a-4a5c-a390-9a27d91dc5e4-1
00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:17.438
the fish would be way, way
lower. So the fish are coming up

255bcaa7-b58a-4a5c-a390-9a27d91dc5e4-2
00:05:17.438 --> 00:05:20.950
and the hat is just kind of
floating along the water on top

255bcaa7-b58a-4a5c-a390-9a27d91dc5e4-3
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.769
of those fish.

80e44094-c5d3-4bc0-b413-6a126162d235-0
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.672
What's going on here? It looks
like something under the water

80e44094-c5d3-4bc0-b413-6a126162d235-1
00:05:30.672 --> 00:05:33.130
besides 2 little fishies
kissing.

980863f4-d8d5-4695-84ed-2d89be0e3a28-0
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.480
This is really cute.

3fa97f69-19e5-4753-b928-7ad1f151a3bf-0
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.360
Under the water it looks like
this this hat.

0903268e-aca8-4fcb-9efb-7bec020c4242-0
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.767
Looks like it's got maybe
getting holes in it, the bottom

0903268e-aca8-4fcb-9efb-7bec020c4242-1
00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:51.088
of it. I think maybe one of
those fish attacked it because

0903268e-aca8-4fcb-9efb-7bec020c4242-2
00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:55.483
you can see their tentacles
going up into the bottom of the

0903268e-aca8-4fcb-9efb-7bec020c4242-3
00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:59.804
boat and looks like water's
going to rush up into the boat

0903268e-aca8-4fcb-9efb-7bec020c4242-4
00:05:59.804 --> 00:06:04.271
or down, but something is going
to do happen with the middle

0903268e-aca8-4fcb-9efb-7bec020c4242-5
00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:05.809
section of that boat.

77d8fa75-48dd-4cbb-b1af-6ce62707f67b-0
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.170
The next picture tells us what's
happening. Somehow who's ever in

77d8fa75-48dd-4cbb-b1af-6ce62707f67b-1
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.912
that boat, which I think we saw
earlier was going to be that the

77d8fa75-48dd-4cbb-b1af-6ce62707f67b-2
00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:18.252
child and the Viking type of
individual, they're fishing.

77d8fa75-48dd-4cbb-b1af-6ce62707f67b-3
00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:21.534
They got a fishing pole now, I
don't know how they got a

77d8fa75-48dd-4cbb-b1af-6ce62707f67b-4
00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:25.162
fishing pole, but now they're
fishing and they're pulling up a

77d8fa75-48dd-4cbb-b1af-6ce62707f67b-5
00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:25.450
fish.

fac42c9d-0683-4b09-8c46-37c343467b78-0
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.980
And the rest of the fishes are
just having a good time. They're

fac42c9d-0683-4b09-8c46-37c343467b78-1
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.002
not. Oh, there's a couple of
them that want to grab at the at

fac42c9d-0683-4b09-8c46-37c343467b78-2
00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:36.220
the pole, but one got taken. And
then at the there's another fish

fac42c9d-0683-4b09-8c46-37c343467b78-3
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.390
with a pair of scissors.

8705dea7-3dc9-44ea-b652-9152ca5e72b2-0
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.290
This is very creative.

6d98e059-3584-4b02-a02e-828ef93888e1-0
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.329
fish with a pair scissors. OK,
some kind of fish. OK, let's

6d98e059-3584-4b02-a02e-828ef93888e1-1
00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:49.030
see. So we've got.

02e26292-24e7-4b2e-b185-bdeac1beec7e-0
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.783
The little boat on top of the
water, it's still still either

02e26292-24e7-4b2e-b185-bdeac1beec7e-1
00:06:53.783 --> 00:06:57.122
draining looks like it's
draining, it's just maintaining

02e26292-24e7-4b2e-b185-bdeac1beec7e-2
00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:58.470
itself above the water.

f033663f-5027-479e-9269-c362fd414a4e-0
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.300
And another fish is lifting up.

8de96ff3-3806-4258-8cbd-d8f2814ce405-0
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.410
What would be a horse? What is
that called?

31fc4b3c-8995-46eb-b25f-1c9947f110a0-0
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.460
A horse fish, I think it is.

1bfa6e10-bee8-422d-b04d-0b51f28fd581-0
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.500
Anyways, it's it's.

c9e159d6-ef3d-4f9f-b501-2a45033fd5a6-0
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.173
Yeah, I don't remember exact
wording, but I think it's a

c9e159d6-ef3d-4f9f-b501-2a45033fd5a6-1
00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:20.677
horse fish, and this horse fish
is also wearing a hat that looks

c9e159d6-ef3d-4f9f-b501-2a45033fd5a6-2
00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:21.810
like this little hat.

0f73da96-ec71-44b6-b99f-f6dad192111c-0
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.417
A fish, a big fish is pushing up
this little horse fish so he can

0f73da96-ec71-44b6-b99f-f6dad192111c-1
00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:28.560
look into the boat.

b0070f6e-dc5a-4a14-830a-c7ae0d3ebeb7-0
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.580
And then we've got.

b50992b3-26f7-4da8-9518-00350ed40137-0
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.566
Ohh that little horse fish.
Whatever, I I guess I wish I

b50992b3-26f7-4da8-9518-00350ed40137-1
00:07:36.566 --> 00:07:37.990
could remember that word.

20b86efd-e40b-4fdb-bb89-70b349255a77-0
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.210
Seahorse. {Thank you,
sweetheart.}

5133d970-d91e-4bf9-b909-742d93d0461f-0
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.217
The seahorse and the seahorse is
now leading this boat. He's in

5133d970-d91e-4bf9-b909-742d93d0461f-1
00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.690
charge. He's in full command.

e29ccc36-0d26-4d11-9007-46182dd257b8-0
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.463
And the odd thing now is a snake
wants to get in there too. So

e29ccc36-0d26-4d11-9007-46182dd257b8-1
00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:59.978
they're vying for getting on
that boat at some of these

e29ccc36-0d26-4d11-9007-46182dd257b8-2
00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:03.806
little aquatic animals, and the
snake is going to make it up

e29ccc36-0d26-4d11-9007-46182dd257b8-3
00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:07.885
there. And the seahorse with the
hill hat and the matching, he's

e29ccc36-0d26-4d11-9007-46182dd257b8-4
00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:10.710
like the leader. He's like he's
the captain.

f59f38b1-3b1b-4f8b-b515-037662ef3420-0
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.740
Now where this little?

f03c069f-58a6-4ff9-82d9-2397b1d6abf3-0
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.093
Captain Seahorse is going, is
being shown to us. The water is

f03c069f-58a6-4ff9-82d9-2397b1d6abf3-1
00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:28.061
now leading towards land and I
can see that there's lots of

f03c069f-58a6-4ff9-82d9-2397b1d6abf3-2
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:33.361
many trees and huge trees, very
big trees with, I don't know if

f03c069f-58a6-4ff9-82d9-2397b1d6abf3-3
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:38.329
they're called Mongoose, but
there's birds, there's lots of

f03c069f-58a6-4ff9-82d9-2397b1d6abf3-4
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:43.131
birds, white birds popping out
from the darkness of these

f03c069f-58a6-4ff9-82d9-2397b1d6abf3-5
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:47.520
trees. And the sailboat, we're
going to call it now.

f3602183-da63-4edc-883a-5f4b14abd9b6-0
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.060
Sail hat with the seahorses
leading towards that land. Or it

f3602183-da63-4edc-883a-5f4b14abd9b6-1
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.803
could be a marsh, but it's going
to probably go inside. I think I

f3602183-da63-4edc-883a-5f4b14abd9b6-2
00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:57.470
see a dark spot where it's going
to go inside.

18ad5178-cfce-4fc7-90bc-9119834bae8f-0
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.480
We'll figure this out.

e95a9726-e4a9-469c-bd61-6a9c8fb421e4-0
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.130
So yeah, as it

6bdc43eb-6b4a-42c9-b1e6-d19cdeeefa6e-0
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.540
Gets more towards the, uh, land
figure. It's.

ceefd468-60a5-48e5-bef7-5ae1c2a0eab2-0
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.304
Also on it's on top. It's odd
because it's on top of the

ceefd468-60a5-48e5-bef7-5ae1c2a0eab2-1
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.963
water, but you can see into the
water where the roots of this

ceefd468-60a5-48e5-bef7-5ae1c2a0eab2-2
00:09:17.963 --> 00:09:18.200
land

ce236915-9ddb-4caf-93d9-f21980f6a958-0
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.279
Plants with the birds. You can
see the roots going into the

ce236915-9ddb-4caf-93d9-f21980f6a958-1
00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:25.231
into the water and lots of
little tiny fishes floating

ce236915-9ddb-4caf-93d9-f21980f6a958-2
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.558
around. And very curious fishes.
There's some fishes that are

ce236915-9ddb-4caf-93d9-f21980f6a958-3
00:09:28.558 --> 00:09:32.046
wondering what the heck is going
on here. You can see their eyes

ce236915-9ddb-4caf-93d9-f21980f6a958-4
00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:32.690
popping out.

246a76af-437b-4254-ae2c-49fa07a926f6-0
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.751
And then there's a whole school
of fish that's just swarming

246a76af-437b-4254-ae2c-49fa07a926f6-1
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:41.340
around underneath the the little
boat, the boats making it to

246a76af-437b-4254-ae2c-49fa07a926f6-2
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.730
what I thought was land.

b78e572b-423e-4312-aaf0-dfa3a4161807-0
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.120
But what really might be is
something that is growing out of

b78e572b-423e-4312-aaf0-dfa3a4161807-1
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.540
the water, and it's a big tree,
a big tree with these birds.

d8f5acdc-19ca-44d0-be1e-f3484a5463ca-0
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.730
In it.

749be42c-631a-462e-ab3e-f8e983f640d6-0
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.710
And now we've got.

7d50eb30-f4eb-478b-a8f8-ab22cfdbed55-0
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:05.340
The little sailboat kind of
getting into the roots of this.

2d20cac0-3527-4ce3-9002-51444df04204-0
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.520
Uh.

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-0
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.334
What I want to call it, it looks
like a big tree. The tree, the

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-1
00:10:14.334 --> 00:10:17.962
roots are into the water, but
the boats going through the

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-2
00:10:17.962 --> 00:10:21.591
water now through the roots and
you can see all the other

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-3
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:25.157
animals that are inside this I
guess I'll call it like a

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-4
00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:28.723
swampland. There's some birds
and there's something that

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-5
00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:32.477
looked like 4 legged animals
with bright eyes and I can see

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-6
00:10:32.477 --> 00:10:36.231
hands. It looks like there's
actual people's hands in here.

82068027-ed2c-4022-83cd-7d7e7091127d-7
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:39.609
They're their hands or they're
they're five fingered.

da4257a4-b472-4d09-adc2-66de7e7d0ab3-0
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.430
There's some kind of object in
there animal probably with what

da4257a4-b472-4d09-adc2-66de7e7d0ab3-1
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.429
looks like hands and there's
like at least maybe, maybe it's

da4257a4-b472-4d09-adc2-66de7e7d0ab3-2
00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:50.790
like a four or eight legged
animal.

643192c9-db54-4e14-804d-23978c940f95-0
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.521
And so they're they're they're
staring at the boat and

643192c9-db54-4e14-804d-23978c940f95-1
00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:58.170
wondering, what the heck is the
boat doing in here?

43272309-e5ad-4853-ab59-782ee7f9a43a-0
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:07.540
OK, now we can see from the this
is like a the view from the

43272309-e5ad-4853-ab59-782ee7f9a43a-1
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.700
seahorses.

53faea43-f77c-4851-a2b5-e1f34cc01e28-0
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.460
Viewpoint.

0893eb63-6e71-42ec-a917-7ab0ce34119e-0
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.823
He's now on top of the water and
he can see down into the water

0893eb63-6e71-42ec-a917-7ab0ce34119e-1
00:11:16.823 --> 00:11:21.183
where the roots are growing and
all the other animals are living

0893eb63-6e71-42ec-a917-7ab0ce34119e-2
00:11:21.183 --> 00:11:25.142
and he's observing as he's
passing through the hugest part

0893eb63-6e71-42ec-a917-7ab0ce34119e-3
00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:27.490
of the roots and we see more
fish.

f0eb1882-175e-4ffc-a84c-7572c2be43e3-0
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.083
And you know what's on? He's
gonna end up going to like a

f0eb1882-175e-4ffc-a84c-7572c2be43e3-1
00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:36.042
family. He's gonna find a bunch
more seahorses with checkered

f0eb1882-175e-4ffc-a84c-7572c2be43e3-2
00:11:36.042 --> 00:11:39.937
bodies. I know it sounds crazy,
but these are seahorses with

f0eb1882-175e-4ffc-a84c-7572c2be43e3-3
00:11:39.937 --> 00:11:43.960
checkered bodies, and it looks
like he's going to meet up with

f0eb1882-175e-4ffc-a84c-7572c2be43e3-4
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.919
some others that are like that.
And he might even jump out of

f0eb1882-175e-4ffc-a84c-7572c2be43e3-5
00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:52.070
the boat. Yeah, he jumped out of
the boat. He's hat went flying.

d20e3871-7e77-4b79-b7be-086d08070bed-0
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.400
So now.

d210c143-be49-4ed7-aebc-ecdf9f6fa887-0
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.060
We're.

22c12b74-072d-4f69-bede-48335ed57dea-0
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.120
Looking at a huge single.

c097d53c-4e5d-489e-8ed4-32f73391b438-0
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.305
Aquatic animal and it looks like
the birds are on top and the

c097d53c-4e5d-489e-8ed4-32f73391b438-1
00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:10.971
boats floating by and this this
aquatic animal is not all the

c097d53c-4e5d-489e-8ed4-32f73391b438-2
00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:15.561
way out of the water, but the
funny part of this one is he's

c097d53c-4e5d-489e-8ed4-32f73391b438-3
00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:16.690
smoking a pipe.

de1a8a5d-62ff-4b05-9936-97191f09428a-0
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.310
Yeah, he's got, he's got half of
his head outside the water and.

e287ff4d-60be-4906-bddc-90bf6b7deb0a-0
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.209
He's smoking a pipe, and the
birds are. There's also fishies

e287ff4d-60be-4906-bddc-90bf6b7deb0a-1
00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:27.590
in the bottom water.

fa283966-3998-41f3-b513-57506a8513e4-0
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:36.821
And it looks like this object is
going to pull up some kind of

fa283966-3998-41f3-b513-57506a8513e4-1
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:40.800
old ancient ship from the
bottom.

f2a2bfc7-d030-4bb6-9ade-5d45fe86e8eb-0
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.290
Of the ocean.

91a8b477-a416-4abe-87f7-c7cc9bfa848d-0
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.704
Lot of stuff that's got combined
a couple different boats looks

91a8b477-a416-4abe-87f7-c7cc9bfa848d-1
00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:53.420
like a bunch of wood and this
animal is also smiling.

5aeaf74e-57dd-4274-89ff-7730f3d956a5-0
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.100
It's got legs, it's got arms and
a tail of some sort and fins.

fa370398-71ec-44f5-9c3c-63582467bd9b-0
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.468
And as I might have mentioned
already, smiling. So he's got

fa370398-71ec-44f5-9c3c-63582467bd9b-1
00:13:03.468 --> 00:13:06.958
teeth and eyes and he's got
like, this thing coming out of

fa370398-71ec-44f5-9c3c-63582467bd9b-2
00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.744
his head. Looks like he's going
to take a picture of that paper

fa370398-71ec-44f5-9c3c-63582467bd9b-3
00:13:10.744 --> 00:13:13.820
boat that's still maintaining
itself on this water.

5939d917-33e6-4f35-ab72-f15ee838f353-0
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.174
The other thing is there's
another tiny little boat hat

5939d917-33e6-4f35-ab72-f15ee838f353-1
00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:21.870
like that that's down near all
this debris that's pulling up. I

5939d917-33e6-4f35-ab72-f15ee838f353-2
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.700
don't understand what that's
going to mean, but.

b61a148d-b18f-4dc6-b297-c1373da6960f-0
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.740
Somehow I maybe they capture the
hats and keep them down below.

36a48a12-8060-4300-bc71-a151eb032c87-0
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.560
I don't know.

4715b879-ad09-461a-b5a9-8e2744ca6e8c-0
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.960
Alright, so how here we are on
top of the water.

f59a4104-0b84-4184-b53a-8842c342a0d0-0
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.385
All sorts of animals on top of
the water. Flying chickens.

f59a4104-0b84-4184-b53a-8842c342a0d0-1
00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:51.779
Dragons with like, oh, what are
those called? Jester Hats, court

f59a4104-0b84-4184-b53a-8842c342a0d0-2
00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:55.679
jester hats, little balls on the
end we've got

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-0
00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.554
Animals with tongues coming out.
We got a black cat leaping in

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-1
00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:05.790
the air into that little hat. I
was talking about the little

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-2
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.026
soap. That little ship still
here, that's the focal point of

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-3
00:14:10.026 --> 00:14:14.401
this part of this whole story, I
think. And there's alligators

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-4
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:18.568
and looks like even a zebra.
There's a dog. It's like, it's

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-5
00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:22.526
like a flying lions, flying
elephants, leopards. This is

7d8d4bce-78a3-4e5f-b9de-2f8de0d3c5a6-6
00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:25.790
like animal lovers, I don't
know, psycho trip.

decb74ba-f920-433e-8967-db6b162b58e0-0
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.218
This makes no sense really, but
it's creative and you know,

decb74ba-f920-433e-8967-db6b162b58e0-1
00:14:32.218 --> 00:14:34.820
background. You see this, this
like.

09d23780-50ae-476b-937c-196437ed9bb4-0
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.053
How do you describe that? That's
like a crawling snake type, but

09d23780-50ae-476b-937c-196437ed9bb4-1
00:14:40.053 --> 00:14:43.688
you could see all the little
like he's doing all sorts of

09d23780-50ae-476b-937c-196437ed9bb4-2
00:14:43.688 --> 00:14:47.261
arches with his back, like at
least five humps. It's a 5

09d23780-50ae-476b-937c-196437ed9bb4-3
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.209
humped snake and it's going to,
it's kind of floating in front

09d23780-50ae-476b-937c-196437ed9bb4-4
00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:53.090
of this really bright bulbous.

4be193cc-5b2c-452f-83a7-9a6fa7508e51-0
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.381
What I guess would be a fish
looks like a fish, and that's

4be193cc-5b2c-452f-83a7-9a6fa7508e51-1
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:59.260
one other thing that's showing
up here.

83bfe0d7-b443-40c9-87ea-492557043734-0
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.680
And then there's also something
that looks like it's in the sky.

090d077c-8938-45e6-8213-a2ce6df90afd-0
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.756
It looks like fishes are going
inside of of some kind of

090d077c-8938-45e6-8213-a2ce6df90afd-1
00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:07.140
planet.

3a5761e8-f56d-462c-8827-9b2fc174936b-0
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.920
So.

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-0
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.980
This is interesting at best.
Yeah, I saw the boat. OK, so now

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-1
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.180
it's night time, the boat still
on top of the water and all

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-2
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.590
these similarly similar looking
fishes with just two eyes. You

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-3
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.860
can see their eyes are lights
are swimming towards this boat

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-4
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.200
and the sky has stars in it and
a moon. So that that circular

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-5
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.680
object that I saw in the other
picture that might have been the

3d8abc62-ca04-448b-96b8-dda5de740334-6
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.850
creation of this Crescent moon.

32a6b218-4482-4e24-a7d5-d1e30f97e579-0
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.250
And there's this constellation
of stars.

d7c99c09-1256-4f4b-824b-cdd2b6752128-0
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.769
That may be forming something
into something else too, but

d7c99c09-1256-4f4b-824b-cdd2b6752128-1
00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:49.920
it's it's over the boat, the
boat still there.

7bf77904-e2e6-47b8-8336-08f33bb9ee77-0
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.330
So now it's darkness getting
darker all the time.

198bd9b3-b0ab-495d-8682-f565d5222efa-0
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.116
OK, so all these fish now we're
looking at fish that are all

198bd9b3-b0ab-495d-8682-f565d5222efa-1
00:15:59.116 --> 00:16:02.546
similar that's that's they're
not different like they were

198bd9b3-b0ab-495d-8682-f565d5222efa-2
00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:04.930
before. It's like a big
congregation of.

fb33ebef-d247-4ecd-a673-9ea26fb1bac4-0
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.190
They all look the same. I can't
even think it's a cult anyways,

fb33ebef-d247-4ecd-a673-9ea26fb1bac4-1
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.360
they're all coming in and
towards this.

c83a8139-0cec-446b-9ac4-df2029138ab4-0
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.728
The the boat hat, and I don't
know what they want to know

c83a8139-0cec-446b-9ac4-df2029138ab4-1
00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:20.494
what's inside the boat hat, but
they're going to find out.

c83a8139-0cec-446b-9ac4-df2029138ab4-2
00:16:20.494 --> 00:16:23.401
There's like a lot of them and
they're completely surrounding

c83a8139-0cec-446b-9ac4-df2029138ab4-3
00:16:23.401 --> 00:16:23.870
this boat.

63a709a5-06ad-4872-8828-da1293079490-0
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.949
Now the boat is on top of the
water still, and these fish,

63a709a5-06ad-4872-8828-da1293079490-1
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:29.847
they look like they've done
their duty and they're done.

63a709a5-06ad-4872-8828-da1293079490-2
00:16:29.847 --> 00:16:32.949
They're going back down into the
water. You can only see the

63a709a5-06ad-4872-8828-da1293079490-3
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:35.949
tails off of it, like two or
three, and the eyeballs of 1.

63a709a5-06ad-4872-8828-da1293079490-4
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:38.999
But there's another something
that's coming up from the sky

63a709a5-06ad-4872-8828-da1293079490-5
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.829
and I can't really tell what it
is.

45a16d3f-b9ce-41c8-bd4a-6695a98434e5-0
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.400
But it's got a.

468165a5-2060-4d77-9993-cedfaa5fb3eb-0
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.940


b537df34-aa13-456e-ba64-331d1d5a0710-0
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.896
Stars around it and it's just
looks like it's something that's

b537df34-aa13-456e-ba64-331d1d5a0710-1
00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:55.120
going to either capture the boat
or help the boat.

9b8680a8-faf2-486d-a213-5dbcfb04a674-0
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.857
I wanna say it looks kind of
like a cloud. That's the best

9b8680a8-faf2-486d-a213-5dbcfb04a674-1
00:16:59.857 --> 00:17:03.195
way I can describe it. It's a
cloud, it's but it's not shaped

9b8680a8-faf2-486d-a213-5dbcfb04a674-2
00:17:03.195 --> 00:17:06.050
puffy, it's shaped more like
Leonard Lenny linearly.

e386ac5f-5565-4f59-9c08-747c0e9ff204-0
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.477
Like maybe this big old piece of
fabric. But think of it that

e386ac5f-5565-4f59-9c08-747c0e9ff204-1
00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:11.460
way, like a curtain.

10d22444-1a48-4ffd-8c88-2b8b0021c53a-0
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.091
I was thinking, my curtain is
going to come and it's over.

10d22444-1a48-4ffd-8c88-2b8b0021c53a-1
00:17:16.091 --> 00:17:19.110
It's over the boat in the water.
Let's see what happens next.

3353a4d0-adc1-4f3a-ab03-f6dd00de3558-0
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.260
Oh, you know what it is. I think
it's an iceberg.

4c1ff2d1-4e40-44f5-a70e-9dc6b52904fc-0
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.923
I don't understand why, but now
it looks like a big solid object

4c1ff2d1-4e40-44f5-a70e-9dc6b52904fc-1
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.450
coming out of the ocean.

e7c443ec-4754-4946-aaee-09b6d5819d58-0
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.250
And this little boat still right
there, right in front of it

e7c443ec-4754-4946-aaee-09b6d5819d58-1
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.038
looks very small compared to
this object, which might be an

e7c443ec-4754-4946-aaee-09b6d5819d58-2
00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:44.079
iceberg, could be the way this
is going. It could be, you know,

e7c443ec-4754-4946-aaee-09b6d5819d58-3
00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:45.910
a tree trunk, but it's solid.

3323c2b5-cece-4cd1-afa2-bb43f2a2c306-0
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.070
And you can see the grain in it,
so.

05af26ec-fc75-40b7-ac4f-c2e3e002e65f-0
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.520
As it gets closer to this solid
object, you can see that inside

05af26ec-fc75-40b7-ac4f-c2e3e002e65f-1
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.040
there is floating inside and
there's little ice caps.

07e6a94b-adf9-457b-8b39-20ca31315a9a-0
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.920
And.

d39c9743-d29a-4858-9b48-4610f38073ef-0
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.690
It looks like.

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-0
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.139
I know it's silly, but it looks
like Christmas trees. There's

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-1
00:18:08.139 --> 00:18:11.134
some trees inside there.
Appointed. Let's say there's

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-2
00:18:11.134 --> 00:18:14.351
cone objects. Cone objects
inside this what I thought was

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-3
00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:17.680
an iceberg, but now we're going
inside it. It's more like a

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-4
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.119
cave. Once you're inside The
Cave, you can see that's what it

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-5
00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:24.336
is. You can see the cone
objects. Those might be pathways

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-6
00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:27.664
to other parts of The Cave or
just inside The Cave. Now the

94bf85f3-5e80-48f9-a572-ccae0cfb428c-7
00:18:27.664 --> 00:18:30.050
little boat is floating through
this cave.

c3c757a2-a64e-4ab9-afc4-37004bbeb0b0-0
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Um, the solid object I was
talking about and.

6e6c8b2e-d3ef-4234-ad6b-841cd4a30bc7-0
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.830
It's going towards, it's going
towards what looks like an exit.

4ca0f589-b80c-4c08-b4a6-10c35f87529c-0
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.150
To find out what happened on the
other side of that exit.

7cbc2ce5-dbb5-497b-a787-c32baab9b7a3-0
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.824
Alright, so it gets out of this.
It took this little pathway to

7cbc2ce5-dbb5-497b-a787-c32baab9b7a3-1
00:18:49.824 --> 00:18:51.330
another part of the ocean.

8793534d-fcd0-4f23-a8b4-70053f63347e-0
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.700
This big

14e1c4ea-8181-41cc-be32-c0c8625006f6-0
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.868
What I was thinking was iceberg
and it's now on the outside of

14e1c4ea-8181-41cc-be32-c0c8625006f6-1
00:18:57.868 --> 00:19:01.924
it and it's got there's oh, a
little light beam. Something's

14e1c4ea-8181-41cc-be32-c0c8625006f6-2
00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:06.113
coming out of the ocean with a
light and looking at this boat,

14e1c4ea-8181-41cc-be32-c0c8625006f6-3
00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:07.310
little paper boat.

22d0f07b-1ff8-4ca2-aab3-e398318e07b4-0
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:16.905
Actually is what I think in the
next slide you can see it's like

22d0f07b-1ff8-4ca2-aab3-e398318e07b4-1
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:20.140
a human figure is going to

cc41f845-b373-464f-b4be-57fb0a1dd47c-0
00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.557
Pick up this boat, but it's more
like amphibious. It's got, it's

cc41f845-b373-464f-b4be-57fb0a1dd47c-1
00:19:26.557 --> 00:19:30.775
got fish hands and tentacles and
it's I think the light is

cc41f845-b373-464f-b4be-57fb0a1dd47c-2
00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:35.064
actually part of its own body.
It's like it's got tentacles

cc41f845-b373-464f-b4be-57fb0a1dd47c-3
00:19:35.064 --> 00:19:39.140
with lights on it and it's
looking and it's holding this

8b5d64da-143d-49a4-8de1-772c859eacae-0
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.497
Object. And the other thing is
on here. I'm not sure there's a

8b5d64da-143d-49a4-8de1-772c859eacae-1
00:19:44.497 --> 00:19:48.584
#5. I don't know what the 05
means. Oh, I see. Hang on,

8b5d64da-143d-49a4-8de1-772c859eacae-2
00:19:48.584 --> 00:19:52.890
there's two of these objects,
one is #8 and one is #5 and.

2f7b0f89-ff76-44e2-85df-aa5df0ec6ced-0
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.190
That's just how you identify
them. Maybe that's their their

2f7b0f89-ff76-44e2-85df-aa5df0ec6ced-1
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.860
code numbers for whatever party
they're from, but they they look

2f7b0f89-ff76-44e2-85df-aa5df0ec6ced-2
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.529
actually like scuba divers. But
they're fish and they're they're

2f7b0f89-ff76-44e2-85df-aa5df0ec6ced-3
00:20:07.529 --> 00:20:11.050
observing this object that was a
paper boat and.

0eba834d-f547-4761-a816-b92efb48a156-0
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.963
Something's coming out of the of
the eyeballs of this number 8

0eba834d-f547-4761-a816-b92efb48a156-1
00:20:15.963 --> 00:20:19.636
guy. Maybe #5 too, but #8 for
sure. It's like his eyeballs are

0eba834d-f547-4761-a816-b92efb48a156-2
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:22.901
falling out of his head.
Something is falling out. It's

0eba834d-f547-4761-a816-b92efb48a156-3
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:26.400
either tears or his eyes or
something, but it's coming out.

4450b80a-a70a-4d0f-99ba-866ebb5a995a-0
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.950
Alright, let's see here now.

b6e26574-7791-4fd1-abd1-063d86f8475b-0
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.622
It looks like they're making
their way towards a larger boat.

b6e26574-7791-4fd1-abd1-063d86f8475b-1
00:20:37.622 --> 00:20:42.363
I see the little baby boat that
we've been dealing with and very

b6e26574-7791-4fd1-abd1-063d86f8475b-2
00:20:42.363 --> 00:20:46.521
in the foreground of this
picture, very, very small. And

b6e26574-7791-4fd1-abd1-063d86f8475b-3
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:51.116
then you can see the tentacle of
one of those amphibious scuba

b6e26574-7791-4fd1-abd1-063d86f8475b-4
00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:52.940
divers looking up at this

604a02f2-a1f8-4bf8-91d9-7f11f45544e7-0
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.545
Boat. There's a big boat and
there's smoke coming out of this

604a02f2-a1f8-4bf8-91d9-7f11f45544e7-1
00:20:57.545 --> 00:21:01.269
boat, and there's birds around
the boat and there's an anchor,

604a02f2-a1f8-4bf8-91d9-7f11f45544e7-2
00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:02.570
but it's not anchored.

265f669d-2295-4441-b276-f3f3072bdead-0
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.671
I can't really tell much more
separately. It's large, it's

265f669d-2295-4441-b276-f3f3072bdead-1
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:12.856
very large. So let's see what's
going to happen to the little

265f669d-2295-4441-b276-f3f3072bdead-2
00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:13.370
boat next.

e540f869-5523-4459-8933-9d57e1daf03a-0
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.769
OK, the little boat is now not
night time again, and the little

e540f869-5523-4459-8933-9d57e1daf03a-1
00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:23.638
boat is still in the water. Now
there's birds flying all around

e540f869-5523-4459-8933-9d57e1daf03a-2
00:21:23.638 --> 00:21:26.540
it and you can see the trees in
the background.

2fcbc962-0888-461e-a4ce-052d2a0231c1-0
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.550
The birds are not.

4efa8fab-1c43-45f0-9297-2d3194422c40-0
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.623
On top of it necessarily. But
they're kind of like, oh, you

4efa8fab-1c43-45f0-9297-2d3194422c40-1
00:21:32.623 --> 00:21:36.092
know, like when they fly over
something and they're looking at

4efa8fab-1c43-45f0-9297-2d3194422c40-2
00:21:36.092 --> 00:21:39.505
something. So something may be
inside that boat that we don't

4efa8fab-1c43-45f0-9297-2d3194422c40-3
00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:42.919
know about yet. There's a couple
of fishies on the top of the

4efa8fab-1c43-45f0-9297-2d3194422c40-4
00:21:42.919 --> 00:21:43.250
water.

2c90bc23-3a01-4715-bf62-eeb241914d71-0
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.380
And.

bc517b14-f2db-4c2a-bba7-1ca837c05154-0
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.451
We can see that that vessel that
had the smoke coming out of it,

bc517b14-f2db-4c2a-bba7-1ca837c05154-1
00:21:50.451 --> 00:21:54.190
a large vessel. It's in the
background now as we progress

bc517b14-f2db-4c2a-bba7-1ca837c05154-2
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.900
through the

1a5f3f71-2a79-4c96-a41c-feae9c87d262-0
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.550
Graphic novel.

a98f3815-a615-4cd7-b491-9bedf1fc89b7-0
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.100
And looks like there's a bit of
fire coming out of it. There's.

8c423427-4f3a-43de-8143-6bf8e7ee3c47-0
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.730
Nowhere in this picture do I see
the boat. So.

792d38f0-59b3-4157-81b0-1fadd361e678-0
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.571
Showing me the the big boat from
a distance and the big boat also

792d38f0-59b3-4157-81b0-1fadd361e678-1
00:22:14.571 --> 00:22:16.860
has some fish hanging off of it.

03d8457f-d6bb-4379-8dc3-6bfe2a586c58-0
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.603
But it's it's protruding out of
the water. It may, it may be a

03d8457f-d6bb-4379-8dc3-6bfe2a586c58-1
00:22:21.603 --> 00:22:23.010
building instead of a boat.

eedf04e7-c7da-4775-8828-95fb8619d8a4-0
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:33.320
So from that building I can see
now what's going on. There are.

293b38c3-f113-4c7e-9ae0-a58bb93b5a1a-0
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.670
I guess you call it people.

6d8bda12-6531-4c6c-a17a-c96c8579d150-0
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.610
There are individual.

da701d3f-575a-4ee1-9c04-dc86cbf28d2e-0
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.882
Uh, people shooting out the
little tiny boat and other

da701d3f-575a-4ee1-9c04-dc86cbf28d2e-1
00:22:47.882 --> 00:22:53.405
things in the water and there's
a big claw that's coming down to

da701d3f-575a-4ee1-9c04-dc86cbf28d2e-2
00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.850
possibly pick up.

15830c3c-55fb-4991-a175-30aa069575f9-0
00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:01.390
Something out of the water. It
might look like a human, maybe

15830c3c-55fb-4991-a175-30aa069575f9-1
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:06.349
an escapee. I it almost looks
like he has prison clothes on,

15830c3c-55fb-4991-a175-30aa069575f9-2
00:23:06.349 --> 00:23:10.170
but you can see that they're
trying to attack.

e7452e6a-2117-486d-8276-869ed3b8c65a-0
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.390
And next you see.

f944e729-91bc-4d8f-9f6e-eb73e5051317-0
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.396
What looks like an outer
spaceship type of object also in

f944e729-91bc-4d8f-9f6e-eb73e5051317-1
00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:22.925
the water coming out with this
what I thought was jail prison

f944e729-91bc-4d8f-9f6e-eb73e5051317-2
00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:27.600
outfit. It's really not a prison
outfit, it's more like it just

f944e729-91bc-4d8f-9f6e-eb73e5051317-3
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.348
has lines on it. It's more like
a scuba diving outfit. Different

f944e729-91bc-4d8f-9f6e-eb73e5051317-4
00:23:32.348 --> 00:23:35.489
than the first one we saw though
and this.

a9e8d0a1-2eed-437e-a396-12f3322861b7-0
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.830
Scuba guy is on top of this.
What would I call that?

300c4a95-e19d-4bf4-a3c3-5ca71a7e3520-0
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.930
A missile that is coming out of
the water.

83eec9df-d32a-4488-99b3-63fda642ed70-0
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.715
And you can see there's a buoy
on it and the buoys looking like

83eec9df-d32a-4488-99b3-63fda642ed70-1
00:23:50.715 --> 00:23:54.479
it's gonna come help the boat.
The boat now has a shot in the

83eec9df-d32a-4488-99b3-63fda642ed70-2
00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:58.000
top of it, so it's been hit. So
hopefully this is rescue.

6b522f5e-2bab-45f9-8de9-be2802deb389-0
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.710
It looks like a rescue the

2d754770-a25c-43dd-8fce-12b775840276-0
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.710
Boats being pulled in now by
that aquatic scuba.

e0d550d2-fca7-4c63-a074-f30f6f3704e2-0
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.817
Guy who's not, not. He's not #5
or #8, I'll tell you that. At

e0d550d2-fca7-4c63-a074-f30f6f3704e2-1
00:24:12.817 --> 00:24:16.685
least not that I can see. Might
change his outfit, but somehow

e0d550d2-fca7-4c63-a074-f30f6f3704e2-2
00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:20.246
he's still, he's still savior.
And on the right we've got

e0d550d2-fca7-4c63-a074-f30f6f3704e2-3
00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:24.053
looks. Looks like people are
trying to attack as well. And of

e0d550d2-fca7-4c63-a074-f30f6f3704e2-4
00:24:24.053 --> 00:24:27.492
course, this isn't always
people. Sometimes animals. It

e0d550d2-fca7-4c63-a074-f30f6f3704e2-5
00:24:27.492 --> 00:24:30.010
looks like a reindeer. There's a
jester.

00f21fc3-6cf2-4fb0-94df-84adc23e58af-0
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:37.410
Or Joker, there's a cat. There's
a guy with a a.

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-0
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.104
The horn coming out of his head
again, and this looks like

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-1
00:24:42.104 --> 00:24:45.689
they're flying in. They're
flying in on some kind of kited

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-2
00:24:45.689 --> 00:24:49.517
object. You can see a kite, it's
carrying them over the water.

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-3
00:24:49.517 --> 00:24:53.345
And there's a I don't know if I
mentioned horses, but it's and

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-4
00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:57.172
there's little looks like either
eyeballs or two beings. We're

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-5
00:24:57.172 --> 00:25:01.000
going to have to find out what
that is. But yeah, the one, the

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-6
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.524
boats being saved by one
individual and being attacked by

1a613605-e8dd-43c5-92d9-8dbd947848bf-7
00:25:04.524 --> 00:25:04.949
several

dbc0bb6c-1b17-4f86-aa69-8dc76ac66190-0
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.370
Other animals.

68b9e92e-e05c-4ba8-9e94-2afb4713506a-0
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.528
And then we come, a big huge
wave comes and the big huge wave

68b9e92e-e05c-4ba8-9e94-2afb4713506a-1
00:25:15.528 --> 00:25:19.626
is going to knock over the the
bad guys, let's say the people

68b9e92e-e05c-4ba8-9e94-2afb4713506a-2
00:25:19.626 --> 00:25:21.940
that are being brought in by
kite.

268a3cd7-995c-4d0d-bc4b-9a7cd0cf23ef-0
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.608
They've got, uh, they've got a
hold of of, I think they've got

268a3cd7-995c-4d0d-bc4b-9a7cd0cf23ef-1
00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:28.860
a hold of the boat.

49a51f38-79f7-4f8f-a35c-df656ceeb802-0
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.740
But the way maybe they're trying
to save the boat.

e0eb4fa7-e36a-4a02-84dc-a9d9267692f1-0
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.678
Anyways, they came in on a kite.
They were drawing what looked

e0eb4fa7-e36a-4a02-84dc-a9d9267692f1-1
00:25:37.678 --> 00:25:40.520
like to attack, but they could
be saving it because.

10548f8d-e3ae-467f-ac97-292a9528e49c-0
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.383
Oh, no, no, no. Hang on a
second. I see the little boat in

10548f8d-e3ae-467f-ac97-292a9528e49c-1
00:25:44.383 --> 00:25:45.720
this, in the in the wave.

6a175009-fadc-48a4-8e14-43b70af03f1b-0
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.930
They've got something in their
hands that looks like the boat.

f2db8ef6-9ac6-413b-bd8b-afbcf496f251-0
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.290
And they're just trying to hang
on with their life.

40d52501-581d-44b5-8f7d-2c92654c22e7-0
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.020
Tsunami.

13bbba7d-0a6d-4d3d-9943-bd325f21a6eb-0
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.455
OK, now of course, because there
was this huge wave, we're going

13bbba7d-0a6d-4d3d-9943-bd325f21a6eb-1
00:26:03.455 --> 00:26:07.782
to see lightning. So we have
lightning in the background, and

13bbba7d-0a6d-4d3d-9943-bd325f21a6eb-2
00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:11.969
the little tiny boat with the
little single hole, bullet or

13bbba7d-0a6d-4d3d-9943-bd325f21a6eb-3
00:26:11.969 --> 00:26:14.970
punch wound is all by itself in
the water.

4218fc6e-27ac-41b2-bbbf-c38731b5e16d-0
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.790
That other object that I thought
was the boat.

c5520113-c857-47d3-8cb1-32259bcd03d1-0
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.362
That was either attacking or
saving is now also flying away

c5520113-c857-47d3-8cb1-32259bcd03d1-1
00:26:26.362 --> 00:26:30.585
from the boat in the water. I
don't know where it's going, but

c5520113-c857-47d3-8cb1-32259bcd03d1-2
00:26:30.585 --> 00:26:33.199
it was either there to save and
leave.

e2c3dbc7-e0e4-4ff1-809d-bafa0de70947-0
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.520
Or to attack and leave but I
think it was save and leave.

7caf7bf9-e02b-4f69-ba42-5f1ef6815aa2-0
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.379
OK, now where we're at is the
boat. The little tiny boat with

7caf7bf9-e02b-4f69-ba42-5f1ef6815aa2-1
00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:50.210
the little tiny hole in it is
still moving along.

69e00ca7-7f1c-4eff-8e4c-f443ff066cfb-0
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.975
And it is also still in the
ocean. But this part of the

69e00ca7-7f1c-4eff-8e4c-f443ff066cfb-1
00:26:54.975 --> 00:26:59.278
ocean is really strange, very
strange in a way. It looks like

69e00ca7-7f1c-4eff-8e4c-f443ff066cfb-2
00:26:59.278 --> 00:27:03.302
just kind of some kind of
growth. But these, these, these

69e00ca7-7f1c-4eff-8e4c-f443ff066cfb-3
00:27:03.302 --> 00:27:07.882
growths are like arches and they
look like Donuts. They look like

69e00ca7-7f1c-4eff-8e4c-f443ff066cfb-4
00:27:07.882 --> 00:27:12.184
Donuts. And that they have holes
that you can go through, but

69e00ca7-7f1c-4eff-8e4c-f443ff066cfb-5
00:27:12.184 --> 00:27:15.030
they also might be part of an an
animal.

8dfc539b-3d5f-4522-babd-d6345104d8ac-0
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.580
Because.

4f0bf468-08a7-49b6-aa76-3d62bf327b12-0
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.700
They all come together. It could
just be how can I like something

4f0bf468-08a7-49b6-aa76-3d62bf327b12-1
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.881
is all twisted up like a big old
cord and an animal that's like a

4f0bf468-08a7-49b6-aa76-3d62bf327b12-2
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:30.556
cord because at the very end
there there's there's a head

4f0bf468-08a7-49b6-aa76-3d62bf327b12-3
00:27:30.556 --> 00:27:32.520
coming out and it's pulling on.

3faac0d0-31de-4cdc-b95e-477fb7518846-0
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:34.800
I think.

f5e89ca1-0656-4f0f-a15f-5ca779b33dc8-0
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.950
That object that was that I
thought was the boat that it was

f5e89ca1-0656-4f0f-a15f-5ca779b33dc8-1
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.220
either going to save

943c02f2-2349-4379-bf40-f2e23bbe38cd-0
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.277
Either at first I thought attack
but then I thought save  it's

943c02f2-2349-4379-bf40-f2e23bbe38cd-1
00:27:46.277 --> 00:27:48.990
getting pulled up out of the
water or out of this

5f40dbaf-fbbb-4b7d-afa0-53b9851348ba-0
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.420
Donut

88af9f22-55da-44e0-b68a-9d261537baca-0
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.599
Area. Yeah. And we'll see what
happened next. Got it's got its

88af9f22-55da-44e0-b68a-9d261537baca-1
00:27:57.599 --> 00:28:02.278
mouth on it, that's for sure.
OK, so it might be like a dragon

88af9f22-55da-44e0-b68a-9d261537baca-2
00:28:02.278 --> 00:28:06.883
with lots of coils, because now
I'm looking at an object that

88af9f22-55da-44e0-b68a-9d261537baca-3
00:28:06.883 --> 00:28:11.340
could have been doing that work
and have it as his body all

88af9f22-55da-44e0-b68a-9d261537baca-4
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.419
wrapped around him in coils.

19334001-0710-4e71-8b22-d36ea90601e1-0
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.040
More like a dragon, then you see
the boat floating through.

71c8ee35-a19e-411d-8655-6f1358ddb024-0
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.720
This.

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-0
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.476
With more like now it's more
like a cave of the coils of the

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-1
00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:31.790
body of this Dragon water
dragon. And it's the boats now

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-2
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.331
going to make it out to the
outside. And there's an like an

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-3
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:41.175
another animal that looks like
an elephant, another animal that

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-4
00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:45.792
looks like a Unicorn, which we
know that don't really exist.

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-5
00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:50.485
But of course this whole story
is made-up anyway, so the boat

eacb6eb4-cbaa-4eb7-bd53-9ac02223ad92-6
00:28:50.485 --> 00:28:52.680
is going to be caught, go out

dfcbc1c3-424a-44c0-a416-13dcd6370da7-0
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.790
to this spearheaded.

7dd313c1-a6ac-46aa-aa66-fc0d36e9fa95-0
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.870
Unicornfish.

481812ff-456a-49d9-88e8-b022e91029c8-0
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.282
Looks like almost like a
dolphin. If you know dolphin and

481812ff-456a-49d9-88e8-b022e91029c8-1
00:29:03.282 --> 00:29:06.715
it's got the this this object
has, this animal has water

481812ff-456a-49d9-88e8-b022e91029c8-2
00:29:06.715 --> 00:29:08.100
coming out of his nose.

9e4e5872-3c54-4ab4-ac88-74e8ffc79668-0
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.572
And it's got a partner that is
probably the one I thought was

9e4e5872-3c54-4ab4-ac88-74e8ffc79668-1
00:29:13.572 --> 00:29:18.238
an elephant because it's got a
really long nose into the water

9e4e5872-3c54-4ab4-ac88-74e8ffc79668-2
00:29:18.238 --> 00:29:19.720
and the spearheaded.

6b59c675-09fb-4e58-9dc5-120525629841-0
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.880
Uh.

edc63c72-afca-4cdc-bf2e-8261a0748844-0
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.048
I don't remember what I'm
calling him. The spearheaded

edc63c72-afca-4cdc-bf2e-8261a0748844-1
00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:27.330
fish.

6a1db252-e346-416c-9719-8d77116a3889-0
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.724
Is almost like pointing at
himself and the water that's

6a1db252-e346-416c-9719-8d77116a3889-1
00:29:32.724 --> 00:29:37.577
coming out of his nose is going
into the boat. So the boat's

6a1db252-e346-416c-9719-8d77116a3889-2
00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:42.032
getting flooded and it's being
this whole thing's being

6a1db252-e346-416c-9719-8d77116a3889-3
00:29:42.032 --> 00:29:47.044
observed by what looks like a
flying fish type who's living on

6a1db252-e346-416c-9719-8d77116a3889-4
00:29:47.044 --> 00:29:47.840
an island.

dc7384d3-642a-46c5-b6fa-8e8bd383746c-0
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:55.211
And he's wearing boxers striped
boxers. So this is really odd.

dc7384d3-642a-46c5-b6fa-8e8bd383746c-1
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:59.811
This this could have been
somebody who landed on an

dc7384d3-642a-46c5-b6fa-8e8bd383746c-2
00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:05.117
island. You could see a bottle
and a can and and propellers

dc7384d3-642a-46c5-b6fa-8e8bd383746c-3
00:30:05.117 --> 00:30:10.866
from planes and wheels you know.
But they driving driving wheels

dc7384d3-642a-46c5-b6fa-8e8bd383746c-4
00:30:10.866 --> 00:30:12.370
off of boats and.

bf1a367a-f160-4754-9f01-37b07332ea78-0
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.442
That's about it, but it's very
odd. He's watching as these

bf1a367a-f160-4754-9f01-37b07332ea78-1
00:30:17.442 --> 00:30:21.094
amphibious objects pour water
into the boat, and we'll see

bf1a367a-f160-4754-9f01-37b07332ea78-2
00:30:21.094 --> 00:30:24.560
what happens next. But it's
almost there, almost to the

bf1a367a-f160-4754-9f01-37b07332ea78-3
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.869
land.

e35b7963-c302-4325-96b4-b6e2bdb41d7d-0
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:25.860
It's.

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-0
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.484
I think we're underneath the
water again now. And we've got

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-1
00:30:31.484 --> 00:30:35.509
these like jellyfish. There's a
bunch of jellyfish and some

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-2
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:39.600
other fish and oh, no, no, no,
that's not a fish. That's the

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-3
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.759
the hat. The hat boat has been
sunk, or it's you can see that

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-4
00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:47.851
it's being submerged into the
water where there's a bunch of

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-5
00:30:47.851 --> 00:30:52.076
jellyfish and there's one huge
jellyfish that's probably going

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-6
00:30:52.076 --> 00:30:56.168
to come attack it. We don't
know. The way these go. It could

d2ce2a22-6120-4413-8223-5a8d8936a225-7
00:30:56.168 --> 00:30:57.510
turn out to be good.

197ce702-fc5b-43c5-80b7-2c74caacd93a-0
00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.870
But that's definitely what's
happening. It's it's sinking.

e280f527-6b14-494d-af1a-6baae83b7f09-0
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.320
OK.

9f817892-a1aa-4294-bb72-13064e1f3acf-0
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.420
We've got.

314de08e-7ef6-44a8-9fca-e3b42fd3c613-0
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.390
The jellyfish surrounding the
little boat.

9318fcaa-2292-4e9c-bed5-705902d6b678-0
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.830
And a couple of other fish
floating around.

85a54d06-54e7-414a-8077-87d1228cacd8-0
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.304
The really odd part about this
that I am trying to figure out

85a54d06-54e7-414a-8077-87d1228cacd8-1
00:31:24.304 --> 00:31:25.630
is part of the picture.

d7c475ca-fa5c-442e-b0ca-59e8e037a5ba-0
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.933
On the left hand side shows that
the boat floating with the the

d7c475ca-fa5c-442e-b0ca-59e8e037a5ba-1
00:31:29.933 --> 00:31:32.610
jellyfish but the right hand
side of the page.

10f1e15c-aa7e-498c-a1e5-2a1a285528cf-0
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.050
Looks like one of the jellyfish
is either. Gonna suck it in.

948b5100-f9b0-408c-9ea9-85332d4e1b70-0
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.385
I think so. I think one major
jellyfish is going to suck it

948b5100-f9b0-408c-9ea9-85332d4e1b70-1
00:31:42.385 --> 00:31:42.570
in.

6931b42c-b39b-47f9-9c09-e8ca80d459ee-0
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.992
And the rest of them are going
to go away. It's like I'm the

6931b42c-b39b-47f9-9c09-e8ca80d459ee-1
00:31:47.992 --> 00:31:51.496
winner. It's my hat, it's my
beat up boat. I'm going to get

6931b42c-b39b-47f9-9c09-e8ca80d459ee-2
00:31:51.496 --> 00:31:52.080
this boat.

9c1e8afb-1f34-44a7-ac85-1384dbde5e86-0
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.150
Hat boat. So the hat boat.

9ef88d11-3bbb-42c6-9b97-0ca60947c2b9-0
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.000
I believe is now under spotlight
by these.

f227a2ea-9a45-4539-a4ed-9ffbc7304055-0
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:10.684
fish type of objects, animals,
they're very strange to the

f227a2ea-9a45-4539-a4ed-9ffbc7304055-1
00:32:10.684 --> 00:32:15.581
spotlight on these animals and
these animals have several legs,

f227a2ea-9a45-4539-a4ed-9ffbc7304055-2
00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:20.401
appendages, horns, and I think
what they're doing is examining

f227a2ea-9a45-4539-a4ed-9ffbc7304055-3
00:32:20.401 --> 00:32:21.090
the boat.

29e1306f-c26b-43ee-a6ef-31bd6f34cd9d-0
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.710
But on the right hand side you
can see that

ee992255-946d-465f-9b0e-bfd351055fd7-0
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:31.170
They are actually on top of a
very long, snaky looking thing.

c4104eee-e600-4414-9994-1531084e9b98-0
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:36.671
And there's something exiting
and there's like a submarine

c4104eee-e600-4414-9994-1531084e9b98-1
00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:41.191
exiting out of the water, but
you know, the submarine has the

c4104eee-e600-4414-9994-1531084e9b98-2
00:32:41.191 --> 00:32:45.565
hat. So somehow the hats being
saved, it's going on another

c4104eee-e600-4414-9994-1531084e9b98-3
00:32:45.565 --> 00:32:50.158
adventure outside of the water.
I think now it's been examined

c4104eee-e600-4414-9994-1531084e9b98-4
00:32:50.158 --> 00:32:50.960
and let go.

8248260b-f145-42d0-92cd-b411be6b4486-0
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:59.370
OK, so now we're back to where
this submarine.

088cf838-c6fc-443b-923b-3e2473a26c84-0
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.250
With some naming convention on
it.

a7f61ec3-ae25-4d43-b3b4-181f89e741b0-0
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.238
In, you know, Alphabet
characters, more human of human

a7f61ec3-ae25-4d43-b3b4-181f89e741b0-1
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:14.784
creation. Man-made creation has
the boat on it. And the boat

a7f61ec3-ae25-4d43-b3b4-181f89e741b0-2
00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:19.181
still has the hole in it, but
it's dripping out. It's it's

a7f61ec3-ae25-4d43-b3b4-181f89e741b0-3
00:33:19.181 --> 00:33:23.950
secreting all that extra water.
It's going back into the ocean.

a7f61ec3-ae25-4d43-b3b4-181f89e741b0-4
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:28.347
But the odd thing is that this
submarine is now facing the

a7f61ec3-ae25-4d43-b3b4-181f89e741b0-5
00:33:28.347 --> 00:33:29.540
strange looking.

27808d25-a0c0-4b99-9fe1-2c22600211cc-0
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:36.073
Boat that is actually part of
like a fish boat, a bit huge,

27808d25-a0c0-4b99-9fe1-2c22600211cc-1
00:33:36.073 --> 00:33:42.468
like lots like a like an octopus
boat. And the odd thing is after

27808d25-a0c0-4b99-9fe1-2c22600211cc-2
00:33:42.468 --> 00:33:48.669
the octopus boat, you can see on
the very tail end of the story

27808d25-a0c0-4b99-9fe1-2c22600211cc-3
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:54.774
here that our little boat is set
free, is going to go into the

27808d25-a0c0-4b99-9fe1-2c22600211cc-4
00:33:54.774 --> 00:33:58.650
water, it's going to pass this 8
legged

0b48ef40-b206-480b-ab97-388f5e2d19bf-0
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.758
Boat. Or you know what? I think
maybe, maybe that that fish,

0b48ef40-b206-480b-ab97-388f5e2d19bf-1
00:34:03.758 --> 00:34:07.520
that octopus is attacking that
boat. In any case, the main

0b48ef40-b206-480b-ab97-388f5e2d19bf-2
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.600
thing is that on a very tail end
of this boat is going to exit.

72712e64-a9d0-46ad-b469-3420875df3ea-0
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.680
And so now the boat is being.

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-0
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:22.899
Attended to by some sea otters
and one of them has the boat in

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-1
00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:27.227
his mouth and the other sea
otters that have their heads out

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-2
00:34:27.227 --> 00:34:31.271
of the water are, you know,
looking at him sucking on or

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-3
00:34:31.271 --> 00:34:35.811
holding on to the boat over the
over the water. There's there's

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-4
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:40.210
otters that are just floating
around and watching cute little

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-5
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.750
couple of otters they're one of
them hugging and we got our sea

d747d7bb-b4ee-43e2-a21d-e55f25774a5e-6
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.440
pond on the right hand side and
the sky has clouds.

5d063d2a-93f8-4fbd-8022-9be9e12c562b-0
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.505
But it's it's bright out, it's
not dark yet, and we'll see

5d063d2a-93f8-4fbd-8022-9be9e12c562b-1
00:34:51.505 --> 00:34:54.550
where it's going next. It looks
like it's going to be happy.

4acd48f0-4d79-4dd4-af26-fa11b1f6c872-0
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.619
Alright, now again there's I'm
confused because there's two

4acd48f0-4d79-4dd4-af26-fa11b1f6c872-1
00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:09.020
boats now and two boats in this
same picture.

91c12ecd-3ac7-46b8-85d9-a11cbcf472e8-0
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.490
With the same hole and they're
floating above the water.

5b9b68ce-c8d7-48d6-9559-5802df8cd3cf-0
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.730
On the left hand side of the.

d07d1c59-7a3d-4a14-9dae-582585686ef1-0
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.640
Underwater picture underneath
the water shows a lot of.

963fcca8-a675-4364-b6dd-8d600f313b68-0
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.555
Of the sea quatic animals doing
their thing on the right hand

963fcca8-a675-4364-b6dd-8d600f313b68-1
00:35:29.555 --> 00:35:30.960
side of the picture.

0e33bd75-6b04-48a0-a5fe-e3d6f843eec9-0
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:38.509
Shows more like the observers,
the scuba divers, looking at

0e33bd75-6b04-48a0-a5fe-e3d6f843eec9-1
00:35:38.509 --> 00:35:41.530
things, observing things and.

8e7ed590-b3b3-44fd-9e86-81eb70c9c3a7-0
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.100
There's still aquatic animals
there, but it's more, more

8e7ed590-b3b3-44fd-9e86-81eb70c9c3a7-1
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.350
nature and the boat.

23562d08-4d72-4c4f-ab97-4492f219d3b3-0
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:54.641
Trying to, uh, do research so I
can't tell if it's the same if

23562d08-4d72-4c4f-ab97-4492f219d3b3-1
00:35:54.641 --> 00:35:58.786
it's two hats. Oh, I think it
might be, it might. I might not

23562d08-4d72-4c4f-ab97-4492f219d3b3-2
00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:02.797
have seen the slit in that
picture. It might have been just

23562d08-4d72-4c4f-ab97-4492f219d3b3-3
00:36:02.797 --> 00:36:05.940
a movement of the hat. So we're
back to where?

c311219e-914f-4da6-811f-160d38964354-0
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.820
The hat is on top of the water
and we've got the scuba

c2d576f9-3aa3-4d14-8027-5f6dc2bcd564-0
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.660
Figures taking care of it.

1c49e508-5f61-439e-8425-96257d971175-0
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.178
A couple of birds looks like
they're on a buoy of some sort,

1c49e508-5f61-439e-8425-96257d971175-1
00:36:19.178 --> 00:36:22.938
just kind of float in the water,
and they're going to eventually

1c49e508-5f61-439e-8425-96257d971175-2
00:36:22.938 --> 00:36:26.119
go over to a light tower or a
lighthouse where there's

1c49e508-5f61-439e-8425-96257d971175-3
00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:26.639
somebody.

86f96bb1-6b91-4e6e-9155-1d62ee52dac6-0
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.340
It looks like he has binoculars
waiting for the hat to come

86f96bb1-6b91-4e6e-9155-1d62ee52dac6-1
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:37.673
back. There's some birds in the
background and some clouds, but

86f96bb1-6b91-4e6e-9155-1d62ee52dac6-2
00:36:37.673 --> 00:36:42.590
I think the hats getting closer
towards its eventual home.

d34da0fc-2398-4124-95ce-c10a436a268a-0
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.700
OK, now that was.

b15a689f-6da0-4b62-a08c-bf3fe3894db8-0
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.670
The boat is now.

56c96cca-9a0b-4438-9b77-8ff543b158c0-0
00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.164
Making its way up a structure.
Oh no, it's on the water, so I'm

56c96cca-9a0b-4438-9b77-8ff543b158c0-1
00:37:00.164 --> 00:37:04.056
sorry, it's on the water still.
But there's a structure coming

56c96cca-9a0b-4438-9b77-8ff543b158c0-2
00:37:04.056 --> 00:37:07.578
out of the water. And you can
tell because it looks like

56c96cca-9a0b-4438-9b77-8ff543b158c0-3
00:37:07.578 --> 00:37:11.532
there's algae on part of of this
structure that's in the water.

56c96cca-9a0b-4438-9b77-8ff543b158c0-4
00:37:11.532 --> 00:37:15.300
And then there's just plain
wrought iron that goes up to the

56c96cca-9a0b-4438-9b77-8ff543b158c0-5
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.390
top of a building that's
probably the lighthouse.

6fe8aed6-841e-4c79-83d8-02a2e5e44ddf-0
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.765
Um, maybe it's got some some
clear sections of the

6fe8aed6-841e-4c79-83d8-02a2e5e44ddf-1
00:37:22.765 --> 00:37:26.712
lighthouse, because I can see
through it and there's a long

6fe8aed6-841e-4c79-83d8-02a2e5e44ddf-2
00:37:26.712 --> 00:37:29.410
bridge and boats are next to the
bridge.

a8a744dc-6f50-49bb-85c5-cb9a89e68e1c-0
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:35.059
But our little hat, he's, he's
hanging tough with the big

a8a744dc-6f50-49bb-85c5-cb9a89e68e1c-1
00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:37.180
boats. Yeah, right there.

8314f1d2-249b-490a-939f-0095f0a93edb-0
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.850
Until.

83ff4c21-82f4-4267-825f-6be3617a5d5d-0
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:51.170
The water gets to a certain
level where there's a smaller

83ff4c21-82f4-4267-825f-6be3617a5d5d-1
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.640
boat.

199fe6ad-c556-4541-9542-18fef6235eca-0
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.947
You can see on the side of a
huge boat and our little boat,

199fe6ad-c556-4541-9542-18fef6235eca-1
00:37:56.947 --> 00:38:01.070
it looks like it's it's either
ahead of the boat. I think it's

199fe6ad-c556-4541-9542-18fef6235eca-2
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.820
ahead. I think what's going to
happen is.

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-0
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:09.538
It's kind of like a water, water
waterway, and our little little

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-1
00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:14.079
hat is still the leader and he's
going to be pushed off. The

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-2
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:18.396
water's going to push him off
back into the ocean above a

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-3
00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:22.565
submarine. The point being
behind him is a couple other

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-4
00:38:22.565 --> 00:38:27.031
boats that look like they're
being dragged or pushed by the

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-5
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:31.646
force of the water, and I don't
know if they're the forces of

60f2c81a-345b-46c4-825a-4c6ce70284e2-6
00:38:31.646 --> 00:38:34.550
nature is going to catch up with
them.

76f7e67c-427b-4381-9052-8b4be82deea3-0
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.498
Or not, but he's definitely
going towards another dump into

76f7e67c-427b-4381-9052-8b4be82deea3-1
00:38:39.498 --> 00:38:40.310
the water.

5a240d7d-ac55-42b2-a5f7-d92b6e590911-0
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.590
Riding along on a boat, he's
going to be dumped in the water.

1502d9a7-7544-4cdd-a013-a61118507e7c-0
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.580
And what he was riding along on.

dd2421b2-c4e6-4f3d-ba46-c15a7b97555a-0
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.260
Might not have been a boat,
might have been.

7050199f-d515-4f4e-857d-3a2bf21fd5ff-0
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.160
Other one of those weird
creatures with the.

115ca094-3ebb-47e5-8bbd-e4201565a824-0
00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:02.660
With the self-made scuba.

68f9f9f2-9d30-4978-8372-34546f34cdbe-0
00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.822
Air pump that has light and or
water coming out of it and again

68f9f9f2-9d30-4978-8372-34546f34cdbe-1
00:39:08.822 --> 00:39:11.600
they got this animal is smoking
his pipe.

b29f84f8-c84e-4c37-9bca-1fd6e4427725-0
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:18.226
OK, so we've got this boat and
it's got something that lifts

b29f84f8-c84e-4c37-9bca-1fd6e4427725-1
00:39:18.226 --> 00:39:22.242
people up in the air, like we
call it a scissor lift where I

b29f84f8-c84e-4c37-9bca-1fd6e4427725-2
00:39:22.242 --> 00:39:25.929
work get on the scissor lift,
and that was probably the

b29f84f8-c84e-4c37-9bca-1fd6e4427725-3
00:39:25.929 --> 00:39:29.880
observer from before. He's got
on the scissor lift and he's

b29f84f8-c84e-4c37-9bca-1fd6e4427725-4
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.580
facing this huge aquatic animal
face on.

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-0
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:39.300
But I can't tell what's gonna
happen between those items. I

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-1
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.672
can see that the buoys still
there and on the right hand side

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-2
00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:47.973
we've got, we've now have human
beings observing off of this

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-3
00:39:47.973 --> 00:39:52.203
boat. It's called the new veil
and it's a modern day boat I

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-4
00:39:52.203 --> 00:39:56.222
think more or less. And our
little hat boat is edging up

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-5
00:39:56.222 --> 00:40:00.312
against it or it's edging up
against either a wall or the

3ca79ebf-6ef1-4908-87e5-16c9901f7dc5-6
00:40:00.312 --> 00:40:04.119
boat itself, but you can see
that there's people now.

89451b3c-cbcd-40af-9467-00d03760275b-0
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.414
That's the main thing in this
there's people coming into the

89451b3c-cbcd-40af-9467-00d03760275b-1
00:40:07.414 --> 00:40:09.200
picture at some point of
venture.

bcd895d3-aa33-49e8-a977-b8c3be21903d-0
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.930
Also people in a little boat.

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-0
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:18.756
So it looks like this is maybe
ohh a dock of some sort and

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-1
00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:22.989
because you can see in the
background there's structures,

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-2
00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:27.368
there's a, how can I say this
equipment that is in the sky,

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-3
00:40:27.368 --> 00:40:31.674
equipment in the sky, modern day
times, lifting things up,

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-4
00:40:31.674 --> 00:40:36.346
dropping things down, cranes and
such. And you've got this this

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-5
00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:40.506
other boat with a couple of
people in it there are going

b3b77562-e216-4734-bf7a-aa0f6e54be95-6
00:40:40.506 --> 00:40:41.820
towards this dock.

eefb2582-1b23-4d23-8aac-ee5920fe186c-0
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:46.900
You know it also looks like a
dock because you could see other

eefb2582-1b23-4d23-8aac-ee5920fe186c-1
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.258
boats inside what looked like a
garges and a person standing on

eefb2582-1b23-4d23-8aac-ee5920fe186c-2
00:40:51.258 --> 00:40:55.684
the dock and a person walking on
the dock and then it's like a a

eefb2582-1b23-4d23-8aac-ee5920fe186c-3
00:40:55.684 --> 00:40:59.974
a fish impression on the wall
and I can think I can say clock.

eefb2582-1b23-4d23-8aac-ee5920fe186c-4
00:40:59.974 --> 00:41:04.332
So we're looks to me like we're
going towards a little bit more

eefb2582-1b23-4d23-8aac-ee5920fe186c-5
00:41:04.332 --> 00:41:08.349
of reality. The odd thing is in
the next thing you see is.

ac7024d6-fffe-4f44-aa98-fa24eb765cc6-0
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:14.649
Close up structure, a close up
of that crane structure and the

ac7024d6-fffe-4f44-aa98-fa24eb765cc6-1
00:41:14.649 --> 00:41:19.372
crane is on a boat and there's
people on the boat and this is

ac7024d6-fffe-4f44-aa98-fa24eb765cc6-2
00:41:19.372 --> 00:41:23.715
9. So maybe it has to do with
the five and the eight the

ac7024d6-fffe-4f44-aa98-fa24eb765cc6-3
00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:28.286
earlier I'm not sure people are
talking about. And you know

ac7024d6-fffe-4f44-aa98-fa24eb765cc6-4
00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:32.399
what's tied to the boat. The
buoy is strange looking.

81adf7bc-bfa9-4edd-97df-0238501a0ce0-0
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:37.866
 Strange looking. Looks like
something that gets dropped in

81adf7bc-bfa9-4edd-97df-0238501a0ce0-1
00:41:37.866 --> 00:41:41.280
the water and it's got a bulbous
top and it's it's got.

0bf67d4e-4393-4a25-b8cc-50643f7c4372-0
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.280
Like Windows, it's a ball of
windows and you can see that

0bf67d4e-4393-4a25-b8cc-50643f7c4372-1
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.412
there's a small person in there
looking out and at the bottom of

0bf67d4e-4393-4a25-b8cc-50643f7c4372-2
00:41:52.412 --> 00:41:57.150
this you've got other peepholes
manhole like you know, I've

0bf67d4e-4393-4a25-b8cc-50643f7c4372-3
00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:01.809
places where people can see out
and it looks like it has a

0bf67d4e-4393-4a25-b8cc-50643f7c4372-4
00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:04.100
propeller attached to it too.

91e389ca-ce0a-4e8c-910e-33815a9252e6-0
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:10.400
So combination between a boat
look looks like a.

1e27ffd3-bb8d-49ce-950f-139ff8e207bf-0
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.064
Looks like a ride of some sort.
I can. I think I almost see

1e27ffd3-bb8d-49ce-950f-139ff8e207bf-1
00:42:16.064 --> 00:42:16.420
people.

c2d58f0f-9e0c-41d7-9bac-e50c44b345f3-0
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.530
At the tail of this.

6fb8dcb7-0c68-4525-8149-e77bdbe902f3-0
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:21.440
Item item.

579af25c-9cf9-459f-9acd-4d6604ee2ceb-0
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.650
Yeah, I think they're on the
tail of it, next to some stairs.

42158f2b-caee-4819-9d55-37aba75e7ede-0
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.620
So the paper boat is now coming
up against that smaller boat.

08335e73-407c-44c3-a47d-5b07b4833076-0
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:40.299
And the smaller boat has it
looks fairly normal for modern

08335e73-407c-44c3-a47d-5b07b4833076-1
00:42:40.299 --> 00:42:43.720
day. It's got a couple of dogs,
it's got a kid with a.

9219a673-6463-4538-81c3-67d22045b5f8-0
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.612
Handkerchief on his head and
it's got a pirate pirate flag.

9219a673-6463-4538-81c3-67d22045b5f8-1
00:42:48.612 --> 00:42:52.520
And now but the the odd thing
about this is that it has a

9219a673-6463-4538-81c3-67d22045b5f8-2
00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.226
crane on it too, and it's
pulling something out of the

9219a673-6463-4538-81c3-67d22045b5f8-3
00:42:56.226 --> 00:42:58.180
water in a in a big mesh bag.

a31fc9fa-ab45-4837-95d0-4ee3b8b79df5-0
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.606
And I can't tell what's in that
mesh bag. Oh wait, something

a31fc9fa-ab45-4837-95d0-4ee3b8b79df5-1
00:43:02.606 --> 00:43:04.570
sticking out. Looks like it
caught.

71156b4a-30d1-4f09-8008-81a2504fd0b7-0
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.487
A fish with a with a pointed
nose and that spikes on its

71156b4a-30d1-4f09-8008-81a2504fd0b7-1
00:43:09.487 --> 00:43:13.435
nose. So they're probably
fishing for like, very strange

71156b4a-30d1-4f09-8008-81a2504fd0b7-2
00:43:13.435 --> 00:43:17.591
water creatures. And our little
our little hat boat came up

71156b4a-30d1-4f09-8008-81a2504fd0b7-3
00:43:17.591 --> 00:43:18.630
against it now.

9e547a3d-14a4-4f5b-96b2-9c057418fe98-0
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.581
And the next thing we see is a
building that's called

9e547a3d-14a4-4f5b-96b2-9c057418fe98-1
00:43:23.581 --> 00:43:26.070
exploration and actually
exploratio.

94f05c4b-45a4-4417-916d-9c2d85da0a3d-0
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.727
But it looks like, yeah, maybe
this is the the land where the

94f05c4b-45a4-4417-916d-9c2d85da0a3d-1
00:43:31.727 --> 00:43:32.540
people were.

5959eac8-9de1-456d-ad15-3bf9e69df9ae-0
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.340
Observing what's going on in the
water and you can see.

c9f27abc-6083-45ff-856e-061c9907729f-0
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:40.652
Our little boat coming up
against those stairs. The boat

c9f27abc-6083-45ff-856e-061c9907729f-1
00:43:40.652 --> 00:43:43.200
looks pretty big compared to the
stairs.

0f2710a1-6611-4228-8514-496e9bc8350b-0
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:48.970
And it's still.

92f0713e-b300-4f7e-b0d0-fc7b1bccb5be-0
00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:53.062
We're still, uh, all everything
around here is water. Even

92f0713e-b300-4f7e-b0d0-fc7b1bccb5be-1
00:43:53.062 --> 00:43:56.301
though we've got buildings,
they're coming out of the water.

92f0713e-b300-4f7e-b0d0-fc7b1bccb5be-2
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:58.160
Could be they're part of the
boat.

c1f12fc2-f4db-44d0-9e39-fef6c6186aed-0
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.490
But we'll see.

668a6fd3-02dc-42db-bc9c-8d1e45ec7633-0
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.250
Ohh.

5d9baa22-1abe-4313-aa0c-af55bc389ee7-0
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:12.243
This is more this is now we're
at the city. You can still see

5d9baa22-1abe-4313-aa0c-af55bc389ee7-1
00:44:12.243 --> 00:44:16.240
the water, but the water is
flowing through the city. And

5d9baa22-1abe-4313-aa0c-af55bc389ee7-2
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.480
this city has bridges, and these
bridges have.

b7b5c463-80e5-4b1b-85eb-195505bafcf4-0
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:20.870
Uh.

e0efd899-357f-4c2e-8f3a-867284e115c7-0
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:26.507
Lights, you can see through the
windows. Either that or it's

e0efd899-357f-4c2e-8f3a-867284e115c7-1
00:44:26.507 --> 00:44:27.870
like some kind of.

ba709ed8-1656-46b9-b5c1-4ac96389c85a-0
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.576
Some kind of rock design, you
know? But I I'm. I'm seeing

ba709ed8-1656-46b9-b5c1-4ac96389c85a-1
00:44:34.576 --> 00:44:39.580
Windows, and I see a city of
lights and buildings behind us.

9f7fec63-9465-472b-b669-8d271621722a-0
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.720
The odd thing is, in this
picture you've got.

7ffacff5-0368-490b-ab96-f73d41cbb766-0
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:48.820
You've got a structure that's
dark like a.

3674e9c8-04a1-4bde-ab3e-08b454ac48df-0
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.760
Whole type of structure and it's
got a weird looking.

9280f944-5ef8-4216-be24-1955a23d75f9-0
00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.234
What was that that, that.
Remember that guy who was on the

9280f944-5ef8-4216-be24-1955a23d75f9-1
00:45:00.234 --> 00:45:04.426
island with the wings wearing
the bathing trunks and had the

9280f944-5ef8-4216-be24-1955a23d75f9-2
00:45:04.426 --> 00:45:05.870
propellers that were?

76580ae0-dd78-4ff8-9270-b85349d6cdc5-0
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.505
Set up next to him on the
island. He's flying off of this

76580ae0-dd78-4ff8-9270-b85349d6cdc5-1
00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:15.562
building. You can see our little
bow down below him. Maybe he

76580ae0-dd78-4ff8-9270-b85349d6cdc5-2
00:45:15.562 --> 00:45:19.489
wants to get to it, I'm not
sure. Maybe it was somehow part

76580ae0-dd78-4ff8-9270-b85349d6cdc5-3
00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:23.546
of his life at one point in time
in the water. There's also a

76580ae0-dd78-4ff8-9270-b85349d6cdc5-4
00:45:23.546 --> 00:45:27.407
boat with steam following our
little hat boat, and there's

76580ae0-dd78-4ff8-9270-b85349d6cdc5-5
00:45:27.407 --> 00:45:29.959
some birds observing and birds
flying.

8fb74b22-5401-4bdb-a70b-84d9c2690341-0
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:44.372
So our boat is now coming up to
where it can be observed by a

8fb74b22-5401-4bdb-a70b-84d9c2690341-1
00:45:44.372 --> 00:45:47.660
scuba type of individual.

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-0
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:53.145
And I can't see where the lights
coming from. It's either from

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-1
00:45:53.145 --> 00:45:56.749
his internal flashlight or
somewhere else. The gestures

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-2
00:45:56.749 --> 00:46:00.676
there again, there's the kite,
there's a cat. I can't really

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-3
00:46:00.676 --> 00:46:04.409
tell what's happening here, but
the boat is probably just

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-4
00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:08.465
sailing by. Yeah, it's sailing
by. And it's kind of like being

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-5
00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:12.198
in Disneyland where you're down
below and you're floating

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-6
00:46:12.198 --> 00:46:16.318
through and you're seeing lots
of things. It's almost like that

55dea525-536a-4661-8e88-0c56070912a6-7
00:46:16.318 --> 00:46:18.700
ride. It's a small world, after
all.

b7fbac0b-a9a5-4d8b-9f65-eb9b6ffedc2d-0
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.930
Anyways, the boat is now going
to get.

0af4b92a-8e5f-4d1b-be73-e4b21797803c-0
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.437
Float keep floating and
floating, floating by all of

0af4b92a-8e5f-4d1b-be73-e4b21797803c-1
00:46:27.437 --> 00:46:28.950
this other, uh, activity.

dc2eae9f-9634-4669-af1c-2aadcfab0588-0
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:31.190
We've got.

37e61c01-ebff-4b6a-ac30-c673997b37bb-0
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.090
We've got people talking to
aquatic animals.

729e5f24-0aa2-4434-9d2e-96b8fb852784-0
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:41.533
Very, very, you know, with that
thing, that guy took off his

729e5f24-0aa2-4434-9d2e-96b8fb852784-1
00:46:41.533 --> 00:46:45.030
hat, he took off his scuba
outfit, his tank and his.

1e0ebb39-5289-4daa-9c2b-dc6f585d50b8-0
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.715
It was actually one of those
bulbous things you wear over

1e0ebb39-5289-4daa-9c2b-dc6f585d50b8-1
00:46:49.715 --> 00:46:52.954
your head, kind of like a
helmet, OK. And the boat keeps

1e0ebb39-5289-4daa-9c2b-dc6f585d50b8-2
00:46:52.954 --> 00:46:56.533
going, boats going to just keep
on going through through those

1e0ebb39-5289-4daa-9c2b-dc6f585d50b8-3
00:46:56.533 --> 00:47:00.056
bridges with the windows, with
the lights. It's going to keep

1e0ebb39-5289-4daa-9c2b-dc6f585d50b8-4
00:47:00.056 --> 00:47:01.250
on down that pathway.

01c45b50-7e93-4726-b3f9-aa3a389d4783-0
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.360
And it's now exiting.

5b25af20-378b-4ba3-9453-b02a3b565d1c-0
00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.618
This structure there's a couple
of of small boats. One of them

5b25af20-378b-4ba3-9453-b02a3b565d1c-1
00:47:10.618 --> 00:47:13.755
looks like it might be a
submarine, the other one looks

5b25af20-378b-4ba3-9453-b02a3b565d1c-2
00:47:13.755 --> 00:47:17.340
like it's just a wooden ship and
some fish that are looking on.

88422304-d182-4548-ae7a-f57255c97c0d-0
00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.075
And it's going out again. Just
wherever it's going, it's

88422304-d182-4548-ae7a-f57255c97c0d-1
00:47:21.075 --> 00:47:22.040
floating by itself.

d03c7b1d-9065-45b7-ba63-32af5a39b9f5-0
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.170


2128024a-51ea-47b2-918b-0806edbb4ec0-0
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:30.065
{Our last page, OK,} so this
boat is now making its way

2128024a-51ea-47b2-918b-0806edbb4ec0-1
00:47:30.065 --> 00:47:35.198
towards a a building structure
and it's on land and has a the

2128024a-51ea-47b2-918b-0806edbb4ec0-2
00:47:35.198 --> 00:47:40.082
type of lighting that would be
normal, you know structural

2128024a-51ea-47b2-918b-0806edbb4ec0-3
00:47:40.082 --> 00:47:42.980
lighting coming out of the
ground.

31699109-347f-450d-9dea-5046dde3ee92-0
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.000
And.

9f0dc8c0-f8de-4b27-86cf-2325699ce8de-0
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.683
As it approaches this building,
you can see that somebody's in

9f0dc8c0-f8de-4b27-86cf-2325699ce8de-1
00:47:49.683 --> 00:47:53.382
the boat, so all of a sudden
we've got somebody that's been

9f0dc8c0-f8de-4b27-86cf-2325699ce8de-2
00:47:53.382 --> 00:47:54.799
in this boat all along.

c58e0ec4-2a2f-495a-96e4-8dba6128b0e2-0
00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:00.040
Well, that was an adventure. And
this.

b2ee2290-2d8c-4466-a2e8-2970eda32e1a-0
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.280
Being is coming out of the boat.

4523a104-9d75-4295-b33d-4937c26c16fa-0
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:10.565
Just reaching out. It's leaving
the boat, it's actually getting

4523a104-9d75-4295-b33d-4937c26c16fa-1
00:48:10.565 --> 00:48:15.748
out walking. And the interesting
thing about this character is

4523a104-9d75-4295-b33d-4937c26c16fa-2
00:48:15.748 --> 00:48:16.159
that.

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-0
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:21.487
It's a human. It's designed.
It's drawn like a human being,

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-1
00:48:21.487 --> 00:48:25.950
OK? It's got arms, it's got
legs, it's got eyes, it's got

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-2
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:30.414
it's got the boat on its
sweater. The boat is designed on

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-3
00:48:30.414 --> 00:48:35.262
his sweater. And a lot of the
other aquatic animals that we've

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-4
00:48:35.262 --> 00:48:40.187
talked about and seen are also
on his outfit. He's climbing the

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-5
00:48:40.187 --> 00:48:44.959
stairs and he's climbing up to
another person because you can

e22cba8f-3adb-4b17-8478-21969aaabf6a-6
00:48:44.959 --> 00:48:46.960
see that there's two legs.

becd8f7b-c60c-401b-9a56-c178f86f4d37-0
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.258
These two legs are white. This,
the person that's walking up the

becd8f7b-c60c-401b-9a56-c178f86f4d37-1
00:48:50.258 --> 00:48:53.020
stairs is wearing dark. So now
we've got we can see that

becd8f7b-c60c-401b-9a56-c178f86f4d37-2
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.587
there's two different
individuals at the very top of

becd8f7b-c60c-401b-9a56-c178f86f4d37-3
00:48:55.587 --> 00:48:55.830
this.

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-0
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.307
Structure. And it
might be where it might be where

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-1
00:49:01.307 --> 00:49:04.547
they started to create that the
boat from the very beginning,

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-2
00:49:04.547 --> 00:49:07.840
those two people, the one that
was kind of strange looking in,

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-3
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.923
the one that looked like more
like a human being. But I, I

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-4
00:49:10.923 --> 00:49:14.163
don't know if this is the last
slide, I don't know. But yeah,

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-5
00:49:14.163 --> 00:49:17.456
who was ever in that little boat
went on that rise now back to

4f20b022-d1f9-44bc-9b48-55f0ca9a62df-6
00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:20.540
where he needs to be with him,
another two legged animals. #END_wanderer 

4ae0c165-2f35-46b5-90ef-907ba8f13f6a-0
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:24.440
OK, so that was the story.

2573c54d-71fd-4558-8af4-181913a6ea29-0
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.664
I don't know if that was a
story, but OK, that was whatever

2573c54d-71fd-4558-8af4-181913a6ea29-1
00:49:29.664 --> 00:49:33.996
you interpreted the story. OK,
so the next one is a graphic

2573c54d-71fd-4558-8af4-181913a6ea29-2
00:49:33.996 --> 00:49:36.090
novel that's only two pages.

ab6396bb-67f5-417c-848f-89f7b54e0018-0
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:44.571
#START_arrival_3 Alright, well
again, this is back in a time

ab6396bb-67f5-417c-848f-89f7b54e0018-1
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:47.460
frame that is not mine. Back in
the.

a3537b1d-68a1-4d60-9d1c-8f2e1168cca0-0
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:54.552
Maybe 1800s, early 1900s. We've
got it's in a foreign country

a3537b1d-68a1-4d60-9d1c-8f2e1168cca0-1
00:49:54.552 --> 00:49:59.464
and we've got a young boy
passing out. Looks like Flyers

a3537b1d-68a1-4d60-9d1c-8f2e1168cca0-2
00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:00.240
or signs.

b5291811-4941-4b51-9805-3e107d32e70b-0
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.168
So I don't have any idea what
he's trying to say, but he's

b5291811-4941-4b51-9805-3e107d32e70b-1
00:50:04.168 --> 00:50:04.960
he's definitely.

f2daefb5-962b-4e8c-a8ca-d313d21e73f8-0
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:11.900
material to people and we've got
an older lady with her cat.

744aeb07-89bc-4e71-91a6-9020df842759-0
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.361
Maybe she's listening and
thinking, well, what what's

744aeb07-89bc-4e71-91a6-9020df842759-1
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:20.329
going on around here? Do I need
to leave? What's what's the

744aeb07-89bc-4e71-91a6-9020df842759-2
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:24.429
hassle? What's happening around
me? We've got another man who

744aeb07-89bc-4e71-91a6-9020df842759-3
00:50:24.429 --> 00:50:27.339
looks like he's trying to take
care of his.

6dea6d50-ef09-4855-bcb6-261c5ab2af0b-0
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:28.910
Umm.

5b98ce5e-b6b4-4505-9e5a-6ef91bc2419b-0
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.960
Food or his cart looks like he
has a cart of.

0584482f-7ba6-49d8-a4e6-20953b3ec57c-0
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:40.118
That he pushes around and he's
either putting something in

0584482f-7ba6-49d8-a4e6-20953b3ec57c-1
00:50:40.118 --> 00:50:44.677
there or taking something out.
We got a couple who's got these

0584482f-7ba6-49d8-a4e6-20953b3ec57c-2
00:50:44.677 --> 00:50:49.018
huge eggs that they're going to
probably put in the storage

0584482f-7ba6-49d8-a4e6-20953b3ec57c-3
00:50:49.018 --> 00:50:49.380
unit.

3ce976eb-f241-4434-b931-1ddf6dcf12aa-0
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:51.440
And.

c4357e9b-f707-4c9d-a8c3-f7966ebef416-0
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.514
Then we've got a man getting a
shave. Now the odd thing about

c4357e9b-f707-4c9d-a8c3-f7966ebef416-1
00:50:57.514 --> 00:51:01.798
most of these slides is that
there's also still little weird

c4357e9b-f707-4c9d-a8c3-f7966ebef416-2
00:51:01.798 --> 00:51:06.223
animals that are non descript. I
mean I couldn't tell you what

c4357e9b-f707-4c9d-a8c3-f7966ebef416-3
00:51:06.223 --> 00:51:10.156
the thing with the spokes that
looks like a lizard it's

c4357e9b-f707-4c9d-a8c3-f7966ebef416-4
00:51:10.156 --> 00:51:14.510
supposed to be or the cats not
exactly normal looking. And in

c4357e9b-f707-4c9d-a8c3-f7966ebef416-5
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.389
this one where the guys getting
a shave.

c4908847-c11e-47ee-b381-203191df8ee0-0
00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.412
There's a couple of these
creatures on the ground. They

c4908847-c11e-47ee-b381-203191df8ee0-1
00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:22.250
look like big snails.

f783a33d-4a9d-43d8-b61a-d9b887d2bb5e-0
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.170
And we also have people playing
some music.

25fd3c12-9a1e-406b-a56c-3ab42a06b7fd-0
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.500
Down and and another one man's
playing a horn instrument and

25fd3c12-9a1e-406b-a56c-3ab42a06b7fd-1
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.805
the other man's playing a string
instrument and they've got some

25fd3c12-9a1e-406b-a56c-3ab42a06b7fd-2
00:51:34.805 --> 00:51:36.330
odd looking birds around them.

140a3d27-7c2a-4d26-b54b-f3307afbb920-0
00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.149
And next slide, we see people
sitting and talking about maybe

140a3d27-7c2a-4d26-b54b-f3307afbb920-1
00:51:41.149 --> 00:51:45.120
where they're going to be going.
We look like somebody's reading.

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-0
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.873
And another looks like a lady's
knitting and maybe a child's

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-1
00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:53.826
holding an animal. And there's
people sitting near them, and

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-2
00:51:53.826 --> 00:51:57.585
they've got some kind of hot
steam in front of them, like

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-3
00:51:57.585 --> 00:52:01.604
maybe it's cooking. It's large
enough to be something they're

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-4
00:52:01.604 --> 00:52:05.622
cooking. And then in the final
scene, we got a gentleman with

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-5
00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:09.640
his suitcase who's arrived to
this particular town wondering,

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-6
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.788
where do I go? What do I do? Do
I get it? Do I? You know, looks

8a72d6d7-ba69-4d3a-bc5f-16a3dec471f1-7
00:52:13.788 --> 00:52:16.639
like there's a lot of things
going on here.

bbab1710-4bf9-4290-ac3a-fe24e31af5ce-0
00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.380
I'm just.

3cf7fdbd-bbce-42a4-b7f1-4429b8e3e1bc-0
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:19.000
Not sure where to go.

5b97022a-8ad5-4aed-8a31-01a19582e623-0
00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.899
OK, so I'm looking at this
gentleman now, looking at his

5b97022a-8ad5-4aed-8a31-01a19582e623-1
00:52:23.899 --> 00:52:27.075
watch, it looks like he was
probably supposed to be picked

5b97022a-8ad5-4aed-8a31-01a19582e623-2
00:52:27.075 --> 00:52:30.360
up by somebody. He's kind of
concerned about the time, so he

5b97022a-8ad5-4aed-8a31-01a19582e623-3
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.760
looks up at the big clock.

860fc2d3-c513-4602-88e1-d1964b9a65bd-0
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:37.510
And he continues to walk, and
he's continuing to walk and walk

860fc2d3-c513-4602-88e1-d1964b9a65bd-1
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:41.818
and walk. He's getting darker
out and all of a sudden it's

860fc2d3-c513-4602-88e1-d1964b9a65bd-2
00:52:41.818 --> 00:52:43.060
starting to snow.

7489d175-72b1-40ff-a7b3-df6dc852f2e7-0
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.875
And he's gonna lose his hat.
Fortunately, he picks it up,

7489d175-72b1-40ff-a7b3-df6dc852f2e7-1
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:52.270
puts it back on. He's found him
a road map.

43ed2a1e-3256-4da3-96ea-1c0e2b994c50-0
00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:57.394
And he's looking at the road and
he's reading the map. It's,

43ed2a1e-3256-4da3-96ea-1c0e2b994c50-1
00:52:57.394 --> 00:52:57.690
it's.

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-0
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.441
At first I thought it was a big
map, but basically it's a book

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-1
00:53:02.441 --> 00:53:06.241
and somebody comes to help him
and says, well, as you can see

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-2
00:53:06.241 --> 00:53:09.489
the hand reaching out, do you
need help? And it's an

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-3
00:53:09.489 --> 00:53:13.350
individual who looks like he's
kind of a religious individual.

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-4
00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:17.150
He's got something on his head,
a turban of some sort, really

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-5
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.828
reaching out to help and say
what can I do for you and this

2859298c-ab8d-44da-8ebf-c2b1c368fcd6-6
00:53:20.828 --> 00:53:21.870
man with the hat.

7a6b0332-8c7e-463d-b615-e2372cb1b8b6-0
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:27.071
Looks disturbed. He's like,
well, I don't know, he's just

7a6b0332-8c7e-463d-b615-e2372cb1b8b6-1
00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:31.418
shows in the book and he shows
him, he writes in the book, I'm

7a6b0332-8c7e-463d-b615-e2372cb1b8b6-2
00:53:31.418 --> 00:53:35.833
looking for this bed. I need to
go to a bed. And the individual

7a6b0332-8c7e-463d-b615-e2372cb1b8b6-3
00:53:35.833 --> 00:53:40.042
with the turbine says I will
help you. And he says follow me

7a6b0332-8c7e-463d-b615-e2372cb1b8b6-4
00:53:40.042 --> 00:53:41.560
and he then takes him.

b89464c1-fb04-4be8-8cf2-1ada69ed1508-0
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.410
He's following
the guy with the suitcase and a

b89464c1-fb04-4be8-8cf2-1ada69ed1508-1
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:48.411
suit and the hat is following
this. What I say looked like a

b89464c1-fb04-4be8-8cf2-1ada69ed1508-2
00:53:48.411 --> 00:53:51.560
little like a religious type of
individual. And that individual

b89464c1-fb04-4be8-8cf2-1ada69ed1508-3
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.217
also has an A weird looking
animal on the back of his

b89464c1-fb04-4be8-8cf2-1ada69ed1508-4
00:53:54.217 --> 00:53:54.660
shoulder. #END_arrival_3 

822e7c32-131c-4e2c-974e-a37c72342c9b-0
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.520
OK, so that was that.

30a5d9ab-248a-454f-8f64-56fd6fbe3d95-0
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.460
Now let's take a break.

f69c562d-b2f2-48f9-9c3e-9049b945b866-0
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.920
OK, so.

ff0cc5b3-3bc3-48f7-94f3-fb25b47aaa16-0
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.872
Coming up, this next one is
again a graphic novel. Um, this

ff0cc5b3-3bc3-48f7-94f3-fb25b47aaa16-1
00:54:10.872 --> 00:54:12.260
one has four pages.

07e22912-dc28-4086-88f3-275e76e6c7ab-0
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:21.037
#START_arrival_5 Well, let's
see. Again, this is some time

07e22912-dc28-4086-88f3-275e76e6c7ab-1
00:54:21.037 --> 00:54:21.380
that.

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-0
00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:27.559
I'm not familiar with it and I
don't think it's reality, but it

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-1
00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:32.686
is. It's black and white so you
can get a feel for that. Not

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-2
00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:36.972
black and white. I'm sorry
sepia. And it is a town

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-3
00:54:36.972 --> 00:54:42.099
somewhere where it's near the
water and they have what looks

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-4
00:54:42.099 --> 00:54:47.310
like a cement staircase up to a
castle type of building. Also

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-5
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:52.269
alongside here is a dock where
the boats are out on on the

a83fb194-8518-45dc-bdd0-e493832f5879-6
00:54:52.269 --> 00:54:52.690
dock.

8cf6d505-21bb-420c-9271-10c4c3024a3c-0
00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.014
So they look like wooden boats.
And I can see a boat coming into

8cf6d505-21bb-420c-9271-10c4c3024a3c-1
00:54:57.014 --> 00:55:00.744
land. It's got some beings in
it. They're probably human

8cf6d505-21bb-420c-9271-10c4c3024a3c-2
00:55:00.744 --> 00:55:04.867
beings. There's a it's a night
time kind of twilight time, and

8cf6d505-21bb-420c-9271-10c4c3024a3c-3
00:55:04.867 --> 00:55:08.990
there's birds in the sky and the
the weird thing about this or

8cf6d505-21bb-420c-9271-10c4c3024a3c-4
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:13.048
the different thing about this
structure that looks like kind

8cf6d505-21bb-420c-9271-10c4c3024a3c-5
00:55:13.048 --> 00:55:16.909
of like a castle or a community
of tightly knit buildings.

69736020-763e-42f2-8b01-b1cb0b3715a7-0
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.680
They have symbolic.

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-0
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.011
What do they call them? They're
on top of the buildings, looks

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-1
00:55:28.011 --> 00:55:31.431
like birds kind of like owls
with with little pointed ears

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-2
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:35.024
more or less. Maybe this means
to these people like these are

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-3
00:55:35.024 --> 00:55:38.676
the lookout creatures. These are
our these protect us. I think

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-4
00:55:38.676 --> 00:55:42.211
they're they used maybe they're
kind of like Gore Giles, but

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-5
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:45.805
they're not on the on the top of
the building they're they're

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-6
00:55:45.805 --> 00:55:49.514
they're not on the side of the
building to protect their on top

28d03a1b-573d-441b-8b24-f856b52100a2-7
00:55:49.514 --> 00:55:50.210
looking out.

ee19b717-ba0d-4a74-9477-b739e23f5d66-0
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:56.085
And what's happened here is we
have somebody who's captured

ee19b717-ba0d-4a74-9477-b739e23f5d66-1
00:55:56.085 --> 00:55:56.830
something.

54744f82-d42c-4b2e-aef0-cb065ed6eff4-0
00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.210
Um.

c863a155-3a23-4b51-a82e-f57fde4e863b-0
00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.735
It looks similar to the the
point the pointy eared

c863a155-3a23-4b51-a82e-f57fde4e863b-1
00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:07.755
structure, but I don't know if
that's what it is. Anyways,

c863a155-3a23-4b51-a82e-f57fde4e863b-2
00:56:07.755 --> 00:56:11.639
they're tying a rope around this
item. It's a gentleman.

b063533a-4915-4ffe-831d-9603b9a6de5d-0
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:13.330
And.

aea703ae-e19b-4a95-ab5d-bb78cbfdadf9-0
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.864
The next thing you see is this
gentleman talking to this man

aea703ae-e19b-4a95-ab5d-bb78cbfdadf9-1
00:56:17.864 --> 00:56:21.448
and saying the man also has a
hat on, kind of like the the

aea703ae-e19b-4a95-ab5d-bb78cbfdadf9-2
00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:24.060
ones we've seen before, he says.
Go on up.

d77a5c82-7fda-4d78-a3df-8f29bb64e1b0-0
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:29.096
And so he he does. Let me move
this to see if I can move us out

d77a5c82-7fda-4d78-a3df-8f29bb64e1b0-1
00:56:29.096 --> 00:56:31.350
of the way. Yep, there you go.
And.

10b3b72f-a82e-48a0-9b27-1afe3bf63ac4-0
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:37.212
At the same time, there is a
small boy carrying what looks

10b3b72f-a82e-48a0-9b27-1afe3bf63ac4-1
00:56:37.212 --> 00:56:41.984
like a plate of food up some
stairs, and he's also got some

10b3b72f-a82e-48a0-9b27-1afe3bf63ac4-2
00:56:41.984 --> 00:56:46.676
of those odd licking make
believe creatures. One is a like

10b3b72f-a82e-48a0-9b27-1afe3bf63ac4-3
00:56:46.676 --> 00:56:47.869
that egg shape.

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-0
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:53.355
Uh, mousy type that we had
before and one is a long snake

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-1
00:56:53.355 --> 00:56:57.820
type thing with legs. Anyways,
what this little boy is doing is

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-2
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:02.075
taking a bowl of food up to a
lady and he gives her the bowl

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-3
00:57:02.075 --> 00:57:06.261
and she gave embrace. She says
thank you very much. And the

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-4
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:10.865
next thing you know our man with
the hat is joining this lady and

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-5
00:57:10.865 --> 00:57:14.562
this man who said going
upstairs, the one that I had

47fceca6-3ce5-4d89-9c44-d94ddb158072-6
00:57:14.562 --> 00:57:18.120
mentioned had said hello to the
gentleman earlier.

04225abd-10c3-4636-bf76-11a8111fd4fe-0
00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.530
The ladies welcomed me into the
House and they're all going to

04225abd-10c3-4636-bf76-11a8111fd4fe-1
00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:26.140
have a drink now. There's 4
drinks, so is the kid drinking?

dcface32-7f36-4b53-b43a-e8a7196d76a8-0
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:30.814
Or somebody double doing, I
don't know. But anyways, the

dcface32-7f36-4b53-b43a-e8a7196d76a8-1
00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:34.879
lady is now going to take these
what what looks like food out of

dcface32-7f36-4b53-b43a-e8a7196d76a8-2
00:57:34.879 --> 00:57:38.819
the basket and start preparing
him. She's cutting up something

dcface32-7f36-4b53-b43a-e8a7196d76a8-3
00:57:38.819 --> 00:57:40.569
that looks like a porcupine.

d50a298a-5043-4591-92a4-d1ec64d1767c-0
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:45.000
She's gonna put it in some kind
of cooking vessel.

3c50c0ed-bc1f-4012-adec-add4a64a5bdf-0
00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:46.630
And.

eb1a5807-96b8-43ce-8d6d-7736dafe7613-0
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:50.291
It looks ohh, she's basting
something, I can see that. Yeah,

eb1a5807-96b8-43ce-8d6d-7736dafe7613-1
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:52.830
she's got a baster and where
she's going to make something,

eb1a5807-96b8-43ce-8d6d-7736dafe7613-2
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.099
she's gonna heat something up.

2e969e2c-bca3-4f52-9c2b-d8831ddf0055-0
00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.080
Now we see all the people
sitting around the table and no,

2e969e2c-bca3-4f52-9c2b-d8831ddf0055-1
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.421
there was another adult there.
That's what it was. I don't

2e969e2c-bca3-4f52-9c2b-d8831ddf0055-2
00:58:03.421 --> 00:58:06.988
know. Wait, there was the adult,
there was the man, the woman.

2e969e2c-bca3-4f52-9c2b-d8831ddf0055-3
00:58:06.988 --> 00:58:10.555
No, that's still four people.
Anyways, they're eating me their

2e969e2c-bca3-4f52-9c2b-d8831ddf0055-4
00:58:10.555 --> 00:58:12.820
meal now and they have what
looks like.

97fc826d-1bed-436c-a5c8-80ff6106baee-0
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:14.300
Uh.

fe9c9164-95bc-4d65-a55d-138dc3c73030-0
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.686
A bottle of something to drink
inside of a ceramic bowl. It's

fe9c9164-95bc-4d65-a55d-138dc3c73030-1
00:58:18.686 --> 00:58:22.202
probably wine, but the weird
thing is it looks like some kind

fe9c9164-95bc-4d65-a55d-138dc3c73030-2
00:58:22.202 --> 00:58:25.662
of weird lights coming out of
that. That's the only reason I

fe9c9164-95bc-4d65-a55d-138dc3c73030-3
00:58:25.662 --> 00:58:29.235
mentioned it, because outside of
it there is what looks like a

fe9c9164-95bc-4d65-a55d-138dc3c73030-4
00:58:29.235 --> 00:58:30.540
light bulb on the wall.

5daf65a8-bab6-4616-9153-3abe421ed7a2-0
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:37.191
I could be reading too much into
it. The little boys feeding his

5daf65a8-bab6-4616-9153-3abe421ed7a2-1
00:58:37.191 --> 00:58:42.401
egg shaped animal and the mousy
looking snake cat and the the

5daf65a8-bab6-4616-9153-3abe421ed7a2-2
00:58:42.401 --> 00:58:47.443
man who invited everybody is
using a blowtorch to cook what

5daf65a8-bab6-4616-9153-3abe421ed7a2-3
00:58:47.443 --> 00:58:50.300
looks like maybe a piece of
fish.

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-0
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.832
So they're enjoying their
they're having a good time.

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-1
00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:59.733
These people are laughing,
talking, drinking, eating. Oh,

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-2
00:58:59.733 --> 00:59:03.971
now they're playing music, all
of them. Even the children. The

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-3
00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:08.343
child's playing a string guitar,
the ladies doing a some kind of

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-4
00:59:08.343 --> 00:59:12.649
flute object, and the next thing
you know, this man pulls out a

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-5
00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:16.954
piece of paper. He's going to do
the origami that we've seen in

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-6
00:59:16.954 --> 00:59:21.124
some previous slides or graphic
novels. He creates what looks

2d552d06-d1e4-4b84-9a49-8539b180f86f-7
00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:21.729
like the.

c3a39159-9206-4a44-bd5b-2b61ae1b593c-0
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.500
Child's.

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-0
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:27.445
Ohh I don't know what to call
him. Not the mousey one, this

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-1
00:59:27.445 --> 00:59:31.381
the cat one with the long tail
and the spikes on it. That's

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-2
00:59:31.381 --> 00:59:35.513
what it looks like. He doesn't
origami for the kid and the kid

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-3
00:59:35.513 --> 00:59:39.580
likes it and the gentleman is
now going to make something hot

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-4
00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.647
to drink. He's putting it into
his his cement wall to heat it

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-5
00:59:43.647 --> 00:59:47.386
up and the man and the woman
offered this drink to their

31e12f1a-1a81-4543-933e-50a61b44bc2f-6
00:59:47.386 --> 00:59:47.780
guest.

aebfb31e-c45a-448c-9f07-dfa2c409523a-0
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.570
So the next thing you know,
whatever was in that, it looks

aebfb31e-c45a-448c-9f07-dfa2c409523a-1
00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:59.386
like whatever they gave him to
drink, you can see that it he

aebfb31e-c45a-448c-9f07-dfa2c409523a-2
00:59:59.386 --> 01:00:03.077
had it and then it, it's kind of
odd because then it takes

aebfb31e-c45a-448c-9f07-dfa2c409523a-3
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:06.330
another slide of it pushing
back, pushing back and.

6cccc8ac-4174-45fd-a827-c2b93537f5cf-0
01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.891
I don't know what's happening,
but maybe that's symbolic that

6cccc8ac-4174-45fd-a827-c2b93537f5cf-1
01:00:11.891 --> 01:00:15.659
he is. It's gone, gone away.
Maybe he drank it, ate it,

6cccc8ac-4174-45fd-a827-c2b93537f5cf-2
01:00:15.659 --> 01:00:19.830
whatever it was. He went to bed
is what happened. He wakes up

6cccc8ac-4174-45fd-a827-c2b93537f5cf-3
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.320
and in his bed is that mousy
looking

1c95bb44-3c7a-479c-90f4-8a80f6524a82-0
01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.500
Big mouse cat.

d597077e-2401-441d-9405-5b67d8d11f10-0
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:31.745
A pet of the of the young boy,
but he's befriending him and

d597077e-2401-441d-9405-5b67d8d11f10-1
01:00:31.745 --> 01:00:35.250
that's interesting. Then he gets
dressed.

cf1fd5c1-e234-4082-85bd-c78efde89da8-0
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:40.036
And goes downstairs and helps
himself to some fruit or

cf1fd5c1-e234-4082-85bd-c78efde89da8-1
01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:44.219
something that to eat and he's
sharing it with this mousy

cf1fd5c1-e234-4082-85bd-c78efde89da8-2
01:00:44.219 --> 01:00:48.401
creature. Our next thing you
know he's putting his on his

cf1fd5c1-e234-4082-85bd-c78efde89da8-3
01:00:48.401 --> 01:00:52.584
suit. Oh how cute the little
creature is bringing him his

cf1fd5c1-e234-4082-85bd-c78efde89da8-4
01:00:52.584 --> 01:00:57.200
hat. So he he's thankful for the
food and says here's your hat.

ecd5f093-eff7-4fa3-9991-c530de7784db-0
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.090
And then the man goes out.

3d34cf86-97ba-4635-855e-b3954722f333-0
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:04.670
To the town looks like.

d3ce7efb-c6ee-4ebd-ace9-4b34eec5b5a6-0
01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.478
The one of the animals I think
might be with him, I'm not sure.

d3ce7efb-c6ee-4ebd-ace9-4b34eec5b5a6-1
01:01:09.478 --> 01:01:12.497
The other thing about this
picture is it's weird is some

d3ce7efb-c6ee-4ebd-ace9-4b34eec5b5a6-2
01:01:12.497 --> 01:01:15.780
people are coming and people are
going but it's hard to tell.

cda306f4-5faa-435f-9384-5c598bde8875-0
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.951
And something's happening in the
town that's it looks like it

cda306f4-5faa-435f-9384-5c598bde8875-1
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:26.683
might be somewhat violent. It
looks like people are trying to

cda306f4-5faa-435f-9384-5c598bde8875-2
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:31.568
protect themselves with poles,
but at the same time you can see

cda306f4-5faa-435f-9384-5c598bde8875-3
01:01:31.568 --> 01:01:36.452
there's a gentleman feeding some
of the fish like creatures and

cda306f4-5faa-435f-9384-5c598bde8875-4
01:01:36.452 --> 01:01:37.750
other people are.

7f98bf4c-8e1c-4d6d-a3c2-39776020570a-0
01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:43.670
Buying things, exchanging
there's artwork going on.

eb69e35f-5b64-4e6b-89d3-063d70595561-0
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:48.672
There's people on ladders doing
artwork. There's a lady. It

eb69e35f-5b64-4e6b-89d3-063d70595561-1
01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:52.834
looks like she's got a street
cart. She's making things for

eb69e35f-5b64-4e6b-89d3-063d70595561-2
01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:53.320
people.

81349722-93db-4f47-bf0e-48cfe2e07dca-0
01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.520
And our friend, our gentleman
with the suit.

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-0
01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.535
And the hat and the mouse like
creature is now going up to

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-1
01:02:01.535 --> 01:02:05.541
speak to like a proprietor of a
build a business maybe, or a

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-2
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:09.285
chef. He's got a bowl in his
hand. He's got a weird chef

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-3
01:02:09.285 --> 01:02:13.488
looking hat and he wants to come
inside and then looks like the

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-4
01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:17.232
man saying no, no I don't, I
don't have anything for you

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-5
01:02:17.232 --> 01:02:21.042
right now. I can't have you the
next. The reason I say is

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-6
01:02:21.042 --> 01:02:25.311
because the next one shows this
gentleman talking to another man

b1c06532-b4df-409a-a61c-af0e057250cf-7
01:02:25.311 --> 01:02:27.610
who's working on some kind of
ohh.

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-0
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.829
I don't know, a metal structure.
And he's got an animal with him

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-1
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:35.828
too that I don't recognize. He's
got tools with them. He's fixing

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-2
01:02:35.828 --> 01:02:39.646
something that you know, with
pipes. And he says no, no, no, I

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-3
01:02:39.646 --> 01:02:43.464
I don't. I don't know anything.
I can't help you. And the next

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-4
01:02:43.464 --> 01:02:47.403
thing you see he's talking to a
lady at her work at her place of

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-5
01:02:47.403 --> 01:02:51.099
business where she has seen
weird looking animals coming out

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-6
01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:54.917
of porcelain bowls and she says
no, I don't know, I can't help

8004d453-31d6-4f47-b41f-d7ce40fa225a-7
01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:55.160
you.

541b9986-b30b-4f63-afbc-50a0a6ad6745-0
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.400
And then you see him going to an
air.

68678a88-f395-464b-a2ae-bd43f896ec07-0
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:01.180
Looks like either.

5c50be15-0d37-4f51-a939-ab03972c45c9-0
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.434
Air, an airplane,
something with propellers, it's

5c50be15-0d37-4f51-a939-ab03972c45c9-1
01:03:05.434 --> 01:03:08.853
either a boat with I think it's
a boat, probably like a dock,

5c50be15-0d37-4f51-a939-ab03972c45c9-2
01:03:08.853 --> 01:03:12.272
stockyard, a boat yard. And he's
got his animal with him. And

5c50be15-0d37-4f51-a939-ab03972c45c9-3
01:03:12.272 --> 01:03:15.856
again another strange animal and
a man talking to him saying no,

5c50be15-0d37-4f51-a939-ab03972c45c9-4
01:03:15.856 --> 01:03:18.889
I don't have any information, I
can't help you, sorry. #END_arrival_5 

4a0bb1f7-e8aa-419d-98c0-c4dded11892c-0
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:24.450
Umm, alright, so that was this
part of the story, but that's

4a0bb1f7-e8aa-419d-98c0-c4dded11892c-1
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:29.000
it. OK, that's it. Ohh, and this
is the very last one. This is a

4a0bb1f7-e8aa-419d-98c0-c4dded11892c-2
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.410
complex scene like before. Just
describe what you see and what

4a0bb1f7-e8aa-419d-98c0-c4dded11892c-3
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:37.960
is happening in detail and take
between three and five minutes.

1768a7d0-054d-42e7-ba7c-7b71d0966f63-0
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:47.358
#START_deep_sea_divers So we're
going to close with one of our

1768a7d0-054d-42e7-ba7c-7b71d0966f63-1
01:03:47.358 --> 01:03:52.483
very colorful multi page or open
face Waldo pictures here and

1768a7d0-054d-42e7-ba7c-7b71d0966f63-2
01:03:52.483 --> 01:03:57.526
it's very colorful and it's it
says it's titled The Deep Sea

1768a7d0-054d-42e7-ba7c-7b71d0966f63-3
01:03:57.526 --> 01:04:02.486
Divers. So we've got underwater
and we've got on top of the

1768a7d0-054d-42e7-ba7c-7b71d0966f63-4
01:04:02.486 --> 01:04:07.363
water, on top of the water we've
got all sorts of colorful

1768a7d0-054d-42e7-ba7c-7b71d0966f63-5
01:04:07.363 --> 01:04:09.430
striped boats, red boats.

a45f8efb-20aa-4f7b-8e91-2f978913beac-0
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:14.207
green boats blue boats, big
boats, small boats. We got sails

a45f8efb-20aa-4f7b-8e91-2f978913beac-1
01:04:14.207 --> 01:04:17.210
on them. We've got mermaids on
top of.

4dc1c31f-76b2-49a2-923e-3eedc86a2bea-0
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.480
Whatever comes out of, you know,
not volcanoes, but mountains out

4dc1c31f-76b2-49a2-923e-3eedc86a2bea-1
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.150
of the water.

7937f563-53fc-41e0-8168-0f1670b1dd14-0
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:27.085
Um, we've got people sitting on
those, Oh no, that they're on

7937f563-53fc-41e0-8168-0f1670b1dd14-1
01:04:27.085 --> 01:04:31.068
top of something, some kind of
structure. But there's also

7937f563-53fc-41e0-8168-0f1670b1dd14-2
01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:35.389
people sitting on like big water
creatures, and they're fishing

7937f563-53fc-41e0-8168-0f1670b1dd14-3
01:04:35.389 --> 01:04:39.574
and they're fishing for people.
They're fishing people out of

7937f563-53fc-41e0-8168-0f1670b1dd14-4
01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:40.250
the water.

35ece61e-251a-4c34-a915-4a82f27d3b14-0
01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:42.400
We've got other people that are
fishing.

b83f9e01-aa3c-4507-a27e-cd5161d0eb1a-0
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.547
Just for fish. And we got
somebody jumping out of boat.

b83f9e01-aa3c-4507-a27e-cd5161d0eb1a-1
01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:48.580
This is still all on top of the
water, OK?

df82182f-29d2-43a7-afa1-a4b6e242cfac-0
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.000
We've got.

1262d382-5f73-473e-8701-b1f1bb4bed4e-0
01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:55.830
Boats sinking. Anyways, we're
going to go down now into the

1262d382-5f73-473e-8701-b1f1bb4bed4e-1
01:04:55.830 --> 01:05:01.060
water and we've got fit. We've
got scuba divers, we've got a.

ec7364f6-8116-4115-8272-d620a8cc71ec-0
01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:06.809
What do you call that, a shark
fish or they got a little spear

ec7364f6-8116-4115-8272-d620a8cc71ec-1
01:05:06.809 --> 01:05:11.454
coming out. We've got, we've got
a man being chased by a by a

ec7364f6-8116-4115-8272-d620a8cc71ec-2
01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:15.424
some kind of fish that's being
held by three or four

ec7364f6-8116-4115-8272-d620a8cc71ec-3
01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:19.170
individuals who are just at the
tip of the water.

b1092ee2-bf70-4c67-a09d-9366e30b51a0-0
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.449
We've got people with guns down
here. We've got people at the

b1092ee2-bf70-4c67-a09d-9366e30b51a0-1
01:05:25.449 --> 01:05:29.827
very bottom reaching up. We've
got a hand reaching up out of

b1092ee2-bf70-4c67-a09d-9366e30b51a0-2
01:05:29.827 --> 01:05:32.340
the algae. We got what looks
like.

8bd04d61-4dcf-4d5c-95d4-d0f2eed9b74b-0
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.870
It looks like 4 guys being.

0cd97ae6-36e9-4879-abf7-24faef5e9df0-0
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.175
They also have either. I almost
want to say they have machine

0cd97ae6-36e9-4879-abf7-24faef5e9df0-1
01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:45.440
guns.

de98aa3f-4267-40c2-9e16-cd5826f5cdff-0
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.400
And we've got a fierce looking
fish hiding behind a.

f3a9c0bc-f14f-4bff-a17c-4b01101b8b2a-0
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:55.260
Ohh, what's that called? Not
algae, but.

51d95262-90db-4fea-b87c-ba556f122ec6-0
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.320
Hmm, I don't remember what it's
called.

beaad5e0-e58b-4b0c-84af-9a23062a042a-0
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:03.720
But it's it grows down below in
the water and.

0ac434dc-0685-455f-a4a2-b6e1aa4a77e7-0
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:10.007
We have a treasure chest with a
gal who's looks like she's found

0ac434dc-0685-455f-a4a2-b6e1aa4a77e7-1
01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:10.420
gold.

2a87fa91-46fb-4a1c-b20d-cf3195ed7203-0
01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:17.319
And we've got fish coming out of
of shells and we've got turtles

2a87fa91-46fb-4a1c-b20d-cf3195ed7203-1
01:06:17.319 --> 01:06:22.659
and we've got, you know, this is
kind of cute. We've got fish.

2a87fa91-46fb-4a1c-b20d-cf3195ed7203-2
01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:27.066
You know how birds fly in
formation? These are fish

2a87fa91-46fb-4a1c-b20d-cf3195ed7203-3
01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:31.219
forming arrows, 3 arrows leading
a mermaid to a.

290f2353-3e33-4cd2-ab3b-c14a86949a37-0
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.960
What looks like a man?

5626d3ac-e645-4eb0-a121-359c300657ca-0
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.270
And.

b67c4911-0586-4332-8e01-31dacd51683c-0
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:41.285
Ohh, if you really focus on
this, there's this really

b67c4911-0586-4332-8e01-31dacd51683c-1
01:06:41.285 --> 01:06:45.498
colorful big fish that's trying
to eat little children. But the

b67c4911-0586-4332-8e01-31dacd51683c-2
01:06:45.498 --> 01:06:49.580
point is, you can barely see the
fish because it blends in so

b67c4911-0586-4332-8e01-31dacd51683c-3
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:53.662
well. A lot of those pictures
kind of like if you really have

b67c4911-0586-4332-8e01-31dacd51683c-4
01:06:53.662 --> 01:06:56.229
to focus on this to see what
there is.

71baf1d2-e54a-4871-847c-fd52467dafcd-0
01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.270
Because it's done so tightly and
so well.

1f8dc46c-fce4-45d3-b4fa-60072da2efba-0
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:04.910
Ohh I see a fish face. It's
little fishes.

438837f4-6518-4e30-8bb9-ef784fcfaa06-0
01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:10.031
Maybe like I said, you know,
creating, creating something.

438837f4-6518-4e30-8bb9-ef784fcfaa06-1
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:14.773
That's what this is probably all
about. There's a circle of red

438837f4-6518-4e30-8bb9-ef784fcfaa06-2
01:07:14.773 --> 01:07:19.366
fish making a face, 2 little
fish, blue fish making eyes, and

438837f4-6518-4e30-8bb9-ef784fcfaa06-3
01:07:19.366 --> 01:07:23.590
an orange fish as a nose and
then green fish as a smile.

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:28.938
Yeah. And then there's another
one that looks like a fish going

9ded6a13-7970-4085-92c4-eba45a881d85-1
01:07:28.938 --> 01:07:32.569
across the water. All the red
fish are making the outline and

9ded6a13-7970-4085-92c4-eba45a881d85-2
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:36.376
the blue fish are in the inside,
like the bot, like the internal

9ded6a13-7970-4085-92c4-eba45a881d85-3
01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:40.007
being or just like the fins.
That's what those are. Those are

9ded6a13-7970-4085-92c4-eba45a881d85-4
01:07:40.007 --> 01:07:43.404
fins and he's got an orange fish
as a as an eyeball gill,

9ded6a13-7970-4085-92c4-eba45a881d85-5
01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:45.220
whatever you call those things.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:49.855
And there's
a lot of stuff going on here. If

c246628e-0afa-4f69-b2ae-dd8fbcd36bf9-1
01:07:49.855 --> 01:07:52.763
you just could probably point
this out for hours if you were

c246628e-0afa-4f69-b2ae-dd8fbcd36bf9-2
01:07:52.763 --> 01:07:54.670
with a child. #END_deep_sea_divers Ohh my goodness
gracious.

01:07:56.330 --> 01:08:00.063
OK. Well, that was about four
minutes and we can be done

99d621f1-65b7-468e-a293-77785bf80239-1
01:08:00.063 --> 01:08:00.450
