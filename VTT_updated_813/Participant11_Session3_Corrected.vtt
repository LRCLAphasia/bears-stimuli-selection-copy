00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.810
Alright, so this is session 3.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.135
Norming study and it will be
the same sort of pictures that

5ad95755-999f-43cd-815d-4a5c75789d6e-1
00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:17.571

sessions. The first one is a

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:22.007
story. So again, please go
through the story and describe

5ad95755-999f-43cd-815d-4a5c75789d6e-3
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.443
what you see and what is
happening and you can start when

5ad95755-999f-43cd-815d-4a5c75789d6e-4
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.820
you're ready, OK?

#START_journey There's a two

ce5bb489-1221-45ca-bb91-d9ce22a10dcd-0
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.570
Of a street scene in.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.849
Residential part of a city, it
looks like, with like three

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.030
And there's a cutaway, so you
can see underneath the street.

cd17b6b1-4e7b-4f14-994c-901245ada8fa-1
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.781
Also, you can see bricks and
pipes for sewage and water. You

cd17b6b1-4e7b-4f14-994c-901245ada8fa-2
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:00.519
can see into the basement of one
person's home.

going back to the street scene.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.704
There's a lamp post. It's like
an old style one with two big

9ba4e442-3f59-4614-827e-d3b8577c4e1c-1
00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:54.045
lamp bulbs sticking out on
either side. At the top and at

9ba4e442-3f59-4614-827e-d3b8577c4e1c-2
00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:58.909
the bottom of the lamp post are
some children playing. There's a

9ba4e442-3f59-4614-827e-d3b8577c4e1c-3
00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.848
boy on a bicycle. There's a girl
on a skateboard. There's another

9ba4e442-3f59-4614-827e-d3b8577c4e1c-4
00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:08.638
boy, and the two boys are giving
each other a high 5. There's a

9ba4e442-3f59-4614-827e-d3b8577c4e1c-5
00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:13.352
mailbox. There's another child
with a purple piece of chalk in

9ba4e442-3f59-4614-827e-d3b8577c4e1c-6
00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:14.550
his or her hand.

f7764acf-01ad-4639-8dfa-37250ad53c70-0
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.758
And all the children are wearing
shorts, so I'm guessing it's

f7764acf-01ad-4639-8dfa-37250ad53c70-1
00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.377
summertime and off in the
distance I see some outlines of

f7764acf-01ad-4639-8dfa-37250ad53c70-2
00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:26.060
trees that look like they're in
full leaf.

30088d06-b07a-4562-bc6f-e6b2d329fe75-0
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.160
And as we move along the street
and there is a.

05d37d61-e77e-45e4-ba8e-ed2afafb5b94-0
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.030
Um.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.550
Street light with stop stop
lights. So there's a the red

869427f6-4974-4d50-ad65-6f1b2a760488-1
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.825
light is illuminated. There's
the red hand telling people not

869427f6-4974-4d50-ad65-6f1b2a760488-2
00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:46.963
to cross. There's an arrow
directing people in which way to

869427f6-4974-4d50-ad65-6f1b2a760488-3
00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:47.169
go.

c1612bec-5118-4aa1-95a5-aca534353354-0
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.783
And as we move along the street,
there's a fire hydrant, and then

c1612bec-5118-4aa1-95a5-aca534353354-1
00:02:52.783 --> 00:02:56.578
we move. We've crossed the
street and we're going up the

c1612bec-5118-4aa1-95a5-aca534353354-2
00:02:56.578 --> 00:02:57.710
steps to another.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.460
Apartment building and there's a
red scooter.

ee0c77e8-8e5b-4f79-90be-81b2be4467fc-0
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.551
Leaning up against the steps and
a girl sitting on the steps

ee0c77e8-8e5b-4f79-90be-81b2be4467fc-1
00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:13.871
hugging her knees to herself and
I think she looks like she's a

ee0c77e8-8e5b-4f79-90be-81b2be4467fc-2
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:18.859
little lonely. And the purple
chalk and the red scooter are

ee0c77e8-8e5b-4f79-90be-81b2be4467fc-3
00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.680
the only real pops of color
along with the the red Street

ee0c77e8-8e5b-4f79-90be-81b2be4467fc-4
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.170
lights. Everything else is in
kind of shades of Gray.

287e4782-4a42-47d5-a651-c5d6d8c59f37-0
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.890
Um, pencil drawing style.

b8c4f4a9-83af-44d6-a7f1-4cd34930f79e-0
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.592
Behind the girl, we can see into
her her home, and there's a

b8c4f4a9-83af-44d6-a7f1-4cd34930f79e-1
00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:44.728
little entrance room that has
wallpaper and a little lamp on a

b8c4f4a9-83af-44d6-a7f1-4cd34930f79e-2
00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:49.537
little table and a potted plant
and a doorway with stairs.

b8c4f4a9-83af-44d6-a7f1-4cd34930f79e-3
00:03:49.537 --> 00:03:54.429
There's a coat rack. There's
some pictures on the wall. The

b8c4f4a9-83af-44d6-a7f1-4cd34930f79e-4
00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:59.646
next room over looks like maybe
it's her mother in the kitchen,

b8c4f4a9-83af-44d6-a7f1-4cd34930f79e-5
00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:03.070
stirring something in a pot on
the stove.

cd642dd1-f245-477b-b77f-e6702ce7b57e-0
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.397
And she's holding the phone to
her ear, and it's an old style

cd642dd1-f245-477b-b77f-e6702ce7b57e-1
00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:11.713
phone with a cord attached to
it. But there's a kitchen scene,

cd642dd1-f245-477b-b77f-e6702ce7b57e-2
00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:15.618
and then upstairs there's a man
sitting at a desk with a

cd642dd1-f245-477b-b77f-e6702ce7b57e-3
00:04:15.618 --> 00:04:19.249
computer in his hand to his
chin. He has a beard and

cd642dd1-f245-477b-b77f-e6702ce7b57e-4
00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.537
glasses. And there's a
bookshelf. There are two

cd642dd1-f245-477b-b77f-e6702ce7b57e-5
00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:23.360
bookshelves.

74cda232-2575-4a1a-8df1-1abb31379ec5-0
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.120
And two framed pictures that
look like they're probably

74cda232-2575-4a1a-8df1-1abb31379ec5-1
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.451
diplomas. And the next room
over. Upstairs there's another

74cda232-2575-4a1a-8df1-1abb31379ec5-2
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:39.873
young person lounging on a
couch, perhaps playing with a DS

74cda232-2575-4a1a-8df1-1abb31379ec5-3
00:04:39.873 --> 00:04:45.113
device or something, a handheld
game and a picture framed

74cda232-2575-4a1a-8df1-1abb31379ec5-4
00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:46.650
picture overhead.

3d436c6d-3bda-43a4-85b8-21830627bea4-0
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.220
On the next page.

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-0
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.450
on the left hand side. There are
three pictures, one over the

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-1
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.926
other, kind of showing a
progression of activity. The

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-2
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:04.917
girl with the red scooter has
come into the kitchen and she's

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-3
00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:08.973
looking on the counter to see
what her mother's doing, and her

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-4
00:05:08.973 --> 00:05:12.706
mother's looking over her
shoulder at her daughter but is

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-5
00:05:12.706 --> 00:05:16.633
really busy cooking and talking
on the phone. So in the next

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-6
00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:20.366
picture, the girl is in her
father's office and now she's

75307606-22f3-48f6-8640-399839b6f316-7
00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:23.069
holding the string of the tail
to a kite.

ee272f6f-5e2c-496e-a5d1-77cd742d742f-0
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.537
And the kite is red. She's
peering over his chair and he's

ee272f6f-5e2c-496e-a5d1-77cd742d742f-1
00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:32.073
staring at his screen. And in
the next picture down, she has

ee272f6f-5e2c-496e-a5d1-77cd742d742f-2
00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:36.832
moved down to the another room,
where perhaps her sister is the

ee272f6f-5e2c-496e-a5d1-77cd742d742f-3
00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:41.220
person lounging on the couch
looking at her handheld game.

a2cb300a-0352-4e71-aaba-3c946c3bfd59-0
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.460
And the girl is holding a red
ball and leaning over the couch.

40345be0-2e8f-4cea-ad1b-f6b78c1b25f4-0
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.426
On the next page, the girl
apparently has gone to her very

40345be0-2e8f-4cea-ad1b-f6b78c1b25f4-1
00:05:53.426 --> 00:05:57.989
own room. She looks so lonely
and sad. She's sitting on her

40345be0-2e8f-4cea-ad1b-f6b78c1b25f4-2
00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:02.324
bed with her knees up and her
head kind of looking down.

40345be0-2e8f-4cea-ad1b-f6b78c1b25f4-3
00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:05.670
There's a big map of the world
on the wall.

4b534557-d450-41d1-b23f-40b255cc3f95-0
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.244
Her bed isn't made. There are
sailboats on her sheets. There's

4b534557-d450-41d1-b23f-40b255cc3f95-1
00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:16.769
a little dresser. There's a cat
curled up on the floor. There's

4b534557-d450-41d1-b23f-40b255cc3f95-2
00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:19.880
some papers on the floor.
There's a window.

df382aec-2d5a-4520-b16b-32057439074b-0
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.190
And that's about it.

5a90d95a-caa9-49a6-86fe-d0bdefbc644a-0
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.753
Next page, the girl is still in
her room. Oh, and I notice that

5a90d95a-caa9-49a6-86fe-d0bdefbc644a-1
00:06:30.753 --> 00:06:34.657
hanging over her bed is a hot
air balloon. Just a little

5a90d95a-caa9-49a6-86fe-d0bdefbc644a-2
00:06:34.657 --> 00:06:39.109
decorative hot air balloon. The
cat has gotten up and is walking

5a90d95a-caa9-49a6-86fe-d0bdefbc644a-3
00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:40.000
out the door.

dc33520a-3cca-42cb-8cba-beaed85a0a42-0
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.362
With his tail fully extended
with a little curl at the end,

dc33520a-3cca-42cb-8cba-beaed85a0a42-1
00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:49.932
and the girl looks to where the
cat had been on the floor and

dc33520a-3cca-42cb-8cba-beaed85a0a42-2
00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:52.070
there's a red piece of chalk.

48f59e12-8fb1-47e6-9ddb-5a2bf0faecb4-0
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.940
she is looking at it and the
next page, the girl has picked

48f59e12-8fb1-47e6-9ddb-5a2bf0faecb4-1
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.470
up the piece of chalk and has
started to draw a line on the

48f59e12-8fb1-47e6-9ddb-5a2bf0faecb4-2
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.075
wall, starting at the floor in
the baseboard and reaching up

48f59e12-8fb1-47e6-9ddb-5a2bf0faecb4-3
00:07:07.075 --> 00:07:11.379
and arching over her head and
the bottom of the {oh, I'm

48f59e12-8fb1-47e6-9ddb-5a2bf0faecb4-4
00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.550
sorry, I have to move the
picture of us.}

6b4c6318-3b96-4a1c-84e4-afb8f5d2c2ff-0
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.653
The first picture on the next
page is the girl crouching on

6b4c6318-3b96-4a1c-84e4-afb8f5d2c2ff-1
00:07:19.653 --> 00:07:22.300
the floor, picking up the chalk
or crayon.

2c77f6a8-f209-4b83-adc9-b733dccdb0a8-0
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.009
Then there's a picture of her.
There are three pictures on this

2c77f6a8-f209-4b83-adc9-b733dccdb0a8-1
00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.608
page of her drawing an arch over
her head, and the next picture,

2c77f6a8-f209-4b83-adc9-b733dccdb0a8-2
00:07:32.608 --> 00:07:37.067
the arch is completed. It's a
doorway with a red door, and she

2c77f6a8-f209-4b83-adc9-b733dccdb0a8-3
00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:41.525
has entered in. Her hand is on
the doorknob, and she's entered

2c77f6a8-f209-4b83-adc9-b733dccdb0a8-4
00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:42.870
into a shaded area.

53acfa36-9453-4e2c-a4ae-4d2aea4920ca-0
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.500
On the next page, it's a two
page spread of a forest area

53acfa36-9453-4e2c-a4ae-4d2aea4920ca-1
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.425
with twinkle lights strung up
throughout the trees and also

53acfa36-9453-4e2c-a4ae-4d2aea4920ca-2
00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:02.515
paper lanterns hanging from the
trees. The paper lanterns are

53acfa36-9453-4e2c-a4ae-4d2aea4920ca-3
00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:07.440
very decorative with different
designs cut out of them and.

423ff7a2-4981-49a2-a4c0-bc0030b980b7-0
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.260
And and no two seemed to be the
same.

dd9acc9a-650e-4f25-9669-d51b1fe7fc8b-0
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.094
She's holding the door, the red
door, open. You can see through

dd9acc9a-650e-4f25-9669-d51b1fe7fc8b-1
00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:23.588
the door into her bedroom. The
door is opening at the base of a

dd9acc9a-650e-4f25-9669-d51b1fe7fc8b-2
00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:28.910
big tree and she's looking up
and around at all of the lights

dd9acc9a-650e-4f25-9669-d51b1fe7fc8b-3
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.399
and the woods all around her.

67958e45-e2c9-4f3e-b25a-9b50489e3306-0
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:38.205
A few steps ahead of her, I see
a stream that's winding through

67958e45-e2c9-4f3e-b25a-9b50489e3306-1
00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:39.240
the picture.

ff6dd863-4835-4dcc-bdea-2f48c63dcf4d-0
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.188
On the next page, the girl is
standing on a little dock at the

ff6dd863-4835-4dcc-bdea-2f48c63dcf4d-1
00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:52.477
edge of the water. She's
standing over the water, looking

ff6dd863-4835-4dcc-bdea-2f48c63dcf4d-2
00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:56.914
into the water and seeing her
reflection. She's holding the

ff6dd863-4835-4dcc-bdea-2f48c63dcf4d-3
00:08:56.914 --> 00:08:58.320
red piece of chalk.

a1aa1ce6-63e7-4666-8a40-1381d25e8600-0
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.760
And she sees her reflection.

165c6db6-0e3e-4b8d-961b-fb11426af498-0
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.034
And around her, or all the trees
and above her are the twinkling

165c6db6-0e3e-4b8d-961b-fb11426af498-1
00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:08.160
lights and the paper lanterns.

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-0
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.075
The next page, there are three
little pictures. The top one,

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-1
00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:19.573
the girl, is kneeling down on
the dock, reaching down with her

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-2
00:09:19.573 --> 00:09:24.213
piece of chalk to the water and
drawing an arched or bowed line.

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-3
00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:28.569
And now she's lying down with
her knees bent up and her feet

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-4
00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:33.138
up in the air. So she's on her
belly, reaching down and drawing

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-5
00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:37.422
some more lines and connecting
them. It's beginning to look

cb92cab3-4af0-4653-bed0-0dc781ebd4c7-6
00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:39.349
like the outline of a boat.

47929deb-e636-46a1-aa6c-95ab5aca5885-0
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.062
And in the third picture at the
bottom of the page, the boat is

47929deb-e636-46a1-aa6c-95ab5aca5885-1
00:09:44.062 --> 00:09:48.252
completely drawn and colored in.
It's all red, and she is sitting

47929deb-e636-46a1-aa6c-95ab5aca5885-2
00:09:48.252 --> 00:09:51.490
in the boat, beginning to move
away from the dock.

e9cd4501-8c8c-41f8-892b-19933cae970f-0
00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:02.070
The next two pages are full
spread of a Kingdom and she is

e9cd4501-8c8c-41f8-892b-19933cae970f-1
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:09.070
in the Little Red boat and a
little waterway approaching.

679b359f-ceac-4044-bcbd-967425505d14-0
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.930
I don't know if it's a bridge
or.

8ec9f583-d7ce-482c-bc4d-b451d404e11d-0
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.727
I'm trying to think of the word
a lock that boats can move

8ec9f583-d7ce-482c-bc4d-b451d404e11d-1
00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:26.994
through, but anyway it's it's
looks like it's some kind of

8ec9f583-d7ce-482c-bc4d-b451d404e11d-2
00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:32.708
passage to get across the land
side and the water to the castle

8ec9f583-d7ce-482c-bc4d-b451d404e11d-3
00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:34.940
area and the castle area.

e72a369a-c532-4618-9538-ec13ed55da5b-0
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.368
It looks like a town, and lots
and lots of buildings. They're

e72a369a-c532-4618-9538-ec13ed55da5b-1
00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:47.447
all connected one to the next,
ones higher and one lower, and

e72a369a-c532-4618-9538-ec13ed55da5b-2
00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:52.526
they all have peaked tops, and
many of them have some kind of

e72a369a-c532-4618-9538-ec13ed55da5b-3
00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:57.441
shingles for roofing. On the
tops of some of the buildings.

e72a369a-c532-4618-9538-ec13ed55da5b-4
00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:02.437
Let's see, there's a little
Pennant flying from one. There's

e72a369a-c532-4618-9538-ec13ed55da5b-5
00:11:02.437 --> 00:11:04.240
an image of a dolphin.

b0855c41-6d92-4751-a236-e8215ac85a97-0
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:11.220
On top of one, there are some
gold domes on a number of them.

8ebe4225-3fa5-4881-9a0e-ccbfca70e5e9-0
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.984
Further in we see water pouring
out of the windows of one of the

8ebe4225-3fa5-4881-9a0e-ccbfca70e5e9-1
00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:26.048
buildings, much higher than the
level of the stream or the river

8ebe4225-3fa5-4881-9a0e-ccbfca70e5e9-2
00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:30.339
below, and as we move along the
sweep of the.

845e19db-28d8-4df3-b5de-f4280864cc75-0
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.118
Passel city. There's a much
bigger bridge on the other side,

845e19db-28d8-4df3-b5de-f4280864cc75-1
00:11:36.118 --> 00:11:41.012
and there's a boat beginning to
pass underneath it and someone

845e19db-28d8-4df3-b5de-f4280864cc75-2
00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:44.120
sitting at the end of the boat
fishing.

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-0
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.124
And then the bridge that's
going, this bigger bridge that's

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-1
00:11:51.124 --> 00:11:55.479
going over also seems to be a
waterway bridge because there's

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-2
00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:59.624
another boat like a gondola
crossing, and there's a person

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-3
00:11:59.624 --> 00:12:03.979
in the back standing up and it
looks like they have a pole to

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-4
00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:08.263
be pushing them along. And there
are three people sitting in

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-5
00:12:08.263 --> 00:12:12.478
there. Perhaps one has a fancy
umbrella over their head and

906cc754-67e6-4b36-a758-02435bbe5912-6
00:12:12.478 --> 00:12:15.779
they're going across and there's
a drawbridge.

aff4e2f1-c85a-4819-b956-25a178a00ba1-0
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.510
And the door is open.

be9c8769-51df-4ae4-b941-af56113cbe52-0
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.810
It's really quite an elaborate
walled city.

1754d9bc-0b9e-4fab-abe1-6a35366aa4b5-0
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.419
That's it. Now. The next two
page spread is a close up inside

1754d9bc-0b9e-4fab-abe1-6a35366aa4b5-1
00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:38.693
of the walled city. The girl is
still in her red boat and it

1754d9bc-0b9e-4fab-abe1-6a35366aa4b5-2
00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:43.620
does look like there are a
system of locks because she's

1754d9bc-0b9e-4fab-abe1-6a35366aa4b5-3
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.721
passed through one waterway
which is at a level lower than

1754d9bc-0b9e-4fab-abe1-6a35366aa4b5-4
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:50.450
where she is at now.

6f8e426e-7a22-4331-9b38-f6ee75d2e424-0
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:57.070
And there is a man in a uniform,
kind of gold colored uniform and

6f8e426e-7a22-4331-9b38-f6ee75d2e424-1
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:01.504
a hat, and he's waving at her
and he has a sash, so it

6f8e426e-7a22-4331-9b38-f6ee75d2e424-2
00:13:01.504 --> 00:13:03.600
definitely looks military.

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-0
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.762
And he's waving at her. To her
left in a little tower, there's

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-1
00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:13.916
another one of those guards
looking out in her direction.

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-2
00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:18.357
Ahead of her is another guard
just beyond that waterway looks

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-3
00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:22.654
like he's looting or perhaps
shading his eyes from the sun.

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-4
00:13:22.654 --> 00:13:27.238
And beyond them, there's another
tower with three guards in it.

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-5
00:13:27.238 --> 00:13:31.965
And there are two are waving and
one is peering around, and we're

fb900630-b966-4752-b460-cfa3dd55f807-6
00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:36.120
at the top of the city. There
we're among the gold domes.

447eebf4-6eee-46e4-b5f6-a7565acac688-0
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.230
And beneath us there's another
intersecting lock.

aa93cab9-f6e9-4a0d-9b71-bb17c820dfb3-0
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:46.590
With the person in the gondola,
one is standing up and pulling

aa93cab9-f6e9-4a0d-9b71-bb17c820dfb3-1
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.601
and another is sitting, and then
further along there's another

aa93cab9-f6e9-4a0d-9b71-bb17c820dfb3-2
00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:56.850
elevated waterway with gondolas.
Two of them, one's going through

aa93cab9-f6e9-4a0d-9b71-bb17c820dfb3-3
00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.986
the passageway and one is
approaching. We see a big

aa93cab9-f6e9-4a0d-9b71-bb17c820dfb3-4
00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:05.917
waterfall, and I can imagine
that maybe there's a water wheel

aa93cab9-f6e9-4a0d-9b71-bb17c820dfb3-5
00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:10.690
and they're generating some
power from it, because there's.

d5d726b3-70e2-4291-ad2f-b41f6754c9f6-0
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.280
Big frothing.

e9b8f8e0-ddd9-4eb2-809f-0d8fd5a43188-0
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.070
Water down at the base of the
waterfall.

aefe60bd-93f4-4273-a530-b6c2c5911088-0
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.964
And they're oh, and we're also,
I can see, off to the far right,

aefe60bd-93f4-4273-a530-b6c2c5911088-1
00:14:25.964 --> 00:14:30.490
a turreted building with it's
like a weather vane at the top,

aefe60bd-93f4-4273-a530-b6c2c5911088-2
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.680
decorated with a golden whale.

7aeaaca4-b8dd-4bc6-a8f5-30fb2648e76e-0
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.120
{Let's see the next page.}

5abfe5bd-b8da-40cc-8eb3-4938efa12b5d-0
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:45.587
Ohh the girl in the red boat at
she's at the top level of the

5abfe5bd-b8da-40cc-8eb3-4938efa12b5d-1
00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:51.365
waterway has gotten to the very
edge and she's about to go down

5abfe5bd-b8da-40cc-8eb3-4938efa12b5d-2
00:14:51.365 --> 00:14:56.782
the waterfall. Underneath are
two perpendicular, so ones 90

5abfe5bd-b8da-40cc-8eb3-4938efa12b5d-3
00:14:56.782 --> 00:15:02.560
degrees perpendicular to her and
then there's another water way

5abfe5bd-b8da-40cc-8eb3-4938efa12b5d-4
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.977
beneath that which is parallel
to her with 2  a gondola and

5abfe5bd-b8da-40cc-8eb3-4938efa12b5d-5
00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:11.860
each and a person pulling in
each gondola.

cee32bd0-c2ce-4766-81c2-c82b78e32ad9-0
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.260
And he's gondola has two people.

93f72c0e-844c-4e09-9dd0-cc2e30c57f76-0
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.184
The people are wearing hats and
in the one gondola they have an

93f72c0e-844c-4e09-9dd0-cc2e30c57f76-1
00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:20.790
umbrella.

a6ea45a1-a0d0-4163-9201-d97792bb8e44-0
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.973
So that's the close up in this
picture. Oh, and at the very

a6ea45a1-a0d0-4163-9201-d97792bb8e44-1
00:15:27.973 --> 00:15:32.612
top, above the girl and the
little tower, the the guards are

a6ea45a1-a0d0-4163-9201-d97792bb8e44-2
00:15:32.612 --> 00:15:37.632
waiting frantically, apparently,
as she's right there on the edge

a6ea45a1-a0d0-4163-9201-d97792bb8e44-3
00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:40.370
about to go over the waterfall
and.

ffbc1942-e0ad-410d-8d9e-325361740e9a-0
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.724
More shadowy in the distance so
you can see outlines of the

ffbc1942-e0ad-410d-8d9e-325361740e9a-1
00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:51.821
other building structures, and
there are clouds. It's a partly

ffbc1942-e0ad-410d-8d9e-325361740e9a-2
00:15:51.821 --> 00:15:57.000
cloudy day and there's a a bird.
It looks like a Phoenix flying

ffbc1942-e0ad-410d-8d9e-325361740e9a-3
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.890
in the sky.

7ab3d397-b4a1-4576-bb5f-2ff673486939-0
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:05.732
In the next page, the girl is
falling through the air. The

7ab3d397-b4a1-4576-bb5f-2ff673486939-1
00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:11.731
boat is falling free from her,
it's below her and she has

7ab3d397-b4a1-4576-bb5f-2ff673486939-2
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:17.420
grabbed her red crayon, or chalk
and is drawing a big.

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-0
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.164
Circle. She hasn't quite
finished the circle, and on the

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-1
00:16:23.164 --> 00:16:27.785
next page she has completely
drawn a hot air balloon, just

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-2
00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:32.720
like the one that was over her
bed in her bedroom. But this is

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-3
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.341
big enough for her to be in the
basket underneath, and the

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-4
00:16:37.341 --> 00:16:42.119
balloon and the basket and the
connecting lines are all red.

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-5
00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:47.131
And now she's floating off above
into the clouds and the guards

691e7847-980a-426f-82a9-fb7a95d4c676-6
00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.150
in the tower.

5230ae33-5dcd-46d0-96ce-3284d5f2b8be-0
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.666
Who are just a little beneath
her are waving at her, and at

5230ae33-5dcd-46d0-96ce-3284d5f2b8be-1
00:16:52.666 --> 00:16:56.200
the top of that turret of the
tower is another.

5130c57c-5dc4-4bc8-bd8e-2991b49c4584-0
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.770
Weathervane with a boat with a
sail decorating the top of it.

210164ad-0807-4783-a4e5-d8a6237586c3-0
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.920
In the next page.

b3d17dab-28ba-4ab9-b204-815c52b70062-0
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.732
I'm wondering if this looks like
it's a two page spread, so off

b3d17dab-28ba-4ab9-b204-815c52b70062-1
00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:17.318
to her right there are more
clouds and a purple bird with a

b3d17dab-28ba-4ab9-b204-815c52b70062-2
00:17:17.318 --> 00:17:19.230
long tail and some other.

16460400-3d9b-4ba4-a0b7-ed38ed81e078-0
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.420
Um air vehicles.

faa9c6f7-a200-45fb-be78-eb64508959f9-0
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:32.497
One looks like it's a boat with
a big Zeppelin above it, but

faa9c6f7-a200-45fb-be78-eb64508959f9-1
00:17:32.497 --> 00:17:38.085
also a little propeller behind
it. And then there's a bigger

faa9c6f7-a200-45fb-be78-eb64508959f9-2
00:17:38.085 --> 00:17:43.123
machine like boat, and these
really look like airboats

faa9c6f7-a200-45fb-be78-eb64508959f9-3
00:17:43.123 --> 00:17:48.620
because they have propellers,
and this bigger one also has.

7c0f7713-f024-4f81-b8f7-8d0213acd46d-0
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.250
Big paddle wheel in it.

3fb73c57-b33e-47c8-b47c-53717046c88c-0
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.320
And it has a couple of
smokestacks.

8a592a27-1f52-4e03-86e6-7e83a923f2c8-0
00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:01.648
And it's, it's plowing into the
clouds and there is a person or

8a592a27-1f52-4e03-86e6-7e83a923f2c8-1
00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:07.730
a statue that's gold colored on
the big vehicle, and then beyond

8a592a27-1f52-4e03-86e6-7e83a923f2c8-2
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.690
it is another one of the smaller
Zeppelin boats, OK.

56e899eb-92b4-4543-ad19-c27557e173d0-0
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.850
And the next two page spread.

6c75aeeb-1aa0-4621-9f11-46d2a20f5221-0
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:24.243
We have a close up of the girl
in the basket of her hot air

6c75aeeb-1aa0-4621-9f11-46d2a20f5221-1
00:18:24.243 --> 00:18:29.187
balloon and now I can see the
detail of the sandbags around

6c75aeeb-1aa0-4621-9f11-46d2a20f5221-2
00:18:29.187 --> 00:18:34.213
the exterior and she's looking
down and across at one of the

6c75aeeb-1aa0-4621-9f11-46d2a20f5221-3
00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:36.520
Zeppelin boats and she sees.

d5721300-5259-4fae-a765-bebd74f985e5-0
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.550
A man pointing.

e87d2c53-1676-4153-8784-93dacb31d83c-0
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.388
Perhaps aiming a gun and he's
wearing some gold clothing,

e87d2c53-1676-4153-8784-93dacb31d83c-1
00:18:45.388 --> 00:18:50.673
decorative clothing. There's
also a little golden bird cage

e87d2c53-1676-4153-8784-93dacb31d83c-2
00:18:50.673 --> 00:18:56.310
in the middle of the boat and at
the other end of the boat. Ah.

d2cd3d43-54f4-4fd6-a930-c78c34e5940e-0
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.409
There are three men. Two are
holding on to the third. The

d2cd3d43-54f4-4fd6-a930-c78c34e5940e-1
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:09.154
third one is leaning all the way
out of the airboat with a net to

d2cd3d43-54f4-4fd6-a930-c78c34e5940e-2
00:19:09.154 --> 00:19:11.070
catch the purple bird.

d5a4dfdd-73f0-4cb9-b647-1bceaa3ef312-0
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:18.955
And then beyond it is the big
boat ship looking much the way

d5a4dfdd-73f0-4cb9-b647-1bceaa3ef312-1
00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:20.370
it did before.

75875732-2cde-41b7-9f79-6306705d67f4-0
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.953
On the next two page spread we
have a close up of the big boat

75875732-2cde-41b7-9f79-6306705d67f4-1
00:19:28.953 --> 00:19:34.242
ship and the girl in her red
balloon in the basket is at the

75875732-2cde-41b7-9f79-6306705d67f4-2
00:19:34.242 --> 00:19:39.532
tail end of the big boat ship.
And as we move along the tail

75875732-2cde-41b7-9f79-6306705d67f4-3
00:19:39.532 --> 00:19:44.648
end along the tail we see the
men now on the big boat ship

75875732-2cde-41b7-9f79-6306705d67f4-4
00:19:44.648 --> 00:19:49.938
holding up the gilded cage and
the purple bird with its tail

75875732-2cde-41b7-9f79-6306705d67f4-5
00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:52.280
hanging out is in the cage.

04d80646-64b3-4aef-8761-c1c90a5581ef-0
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:53.980
Umm.

a6b3d358-6200-46fa-a692-67deef4ac0b9-0
00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.232
Yeah, as we move along the big
boat ship, I have a closer view

a6b3d358-6200-46fa-a692-67deef4ac0b9-1
00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:04.350
of what I I wasn't sure if it
was a person or a statue.

4cd8209f-0c30-4540-95c7-a2b8743251f7-0
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.840
And it looks more like a statue,
the gold.

80903570-f33d-4df2-b806-b012f1ff7390-0
00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.980
Pedestal and on top of it, it
looks.

8bc66170-0bb4-42c7-adc9-a8d3240bb671-0
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.899
Maybe Chinese in style with the
roof or the top of it and a a

8bc66170-0bb4-42c7-adc9-a8d3240bb671-1
00:20:21.899 --> 00:20:26.950
dragon with its wings extended
on top of it and then off.

bb081383-9427-483a-b568-c2537b3da554-0
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.719
In the distance are two more of
the little air boats with the

bb081383-9427-483a-b568-c2537b3da554-1
00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:33.360
Zeppelin balloons on top.

17470741-ae53-468f-96f6-96abb5967d14-0
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.690
All right. And the next two
pages are two separate pictures.

a84d16ad-df24-4eb1-9579-6d153a522091-0
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.980
The first one, the girl has
landed her balloon.

961cd9eb-a420-43a8-b007-6872f0e66b35-0
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.968
On this big boat, air boat, and
she has gotten out and she's

961cd9eb-a420-43a8-b007-6872f0e66b35-1
00:20:51.968 --> 00:20:57.254
running across the walkway
holding her red chalk. There's

961cd9eb-a420-43a8-b007-6872f0e66b35-2
00:20:57.254 --> 00:21:02.540
an open door in the smokestack
that she's running toward.

087c0c4e-8e12-423f-a052-992fc5015998-0
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.721
And up above, between the two
smokestacks, is another walkway,

087c0c4e-8e12-423f-a052-992fc5015998-1
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:11.587
and we've got the three men
carrying the bird and the

087c0c4e-8e12-423f-a052-992fc5015998-2
00:21:11.587 --> 00:21:14.810
gilded, the purple bird and the
gilded cage.

cb80568e-7cb9-4701-bd6e-8a1d1abd0ecc-0
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:21.775
On the next page we have a close
up of two of the men who look

cb80568e-7cb9-4701-bd6e-8a1d1abd0ecc-1
00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:27.488
their garments look like guard
clothes, almost Egyptian like,

cb80568e-7cb9-4701-bd6e-8a1d1abd0ecc-2
00:21:27.488 --> 00:21:32.556
with skirts and helmets and
sandals on their feet, and

cb80568e-7cb9-4701-bd6e-8a1d1abd0ecc-3
00:21:32.556 --> 00:21:37.440
they're on the pedestal of the
big golden structure.

5a81826d-0e80-45eb-b0a5-d01d1728e362-0
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.471
And they have placed the purple
bird and the bird cage on a

5a81826d-0e80-45eb-b0a5-d01d1728e362-1
00:21:42.471 --> 00:21:47.152
stand on top of the pedestal. We
also see the girl climbing up a

5a81826d-0e80-45eb-b0a5-d01d1728e362-2
00:21:47.152 --> 00:21:51.617
ladder. She's almost gotten to
the level where the two guards

5a81826d-0e80-45eb-b0a5-d01d1728e362-3
00:21:51.617 --> 00:21:56.011
and the bird are, and there's a
ladder on her side, and then

5a81826d-0e80-45eb-b0a5-d01d1728e362-4
00:21:56.011 --> 00:21:58.820
across the way there's another
ladder.

25b059b8-1c0e-4d84-89ce-e3e636369f31-0
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.720
On the next two pages there are
two separate pictures. The girl

25b059b8-1c0e-4d84-89ce-e3e636369f31-1
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.465
has grabbed the gilded cage with
the bird off of the little

25b059b8-1c0e-4d84-89ce-e3e636369f31-2
00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:16.893
pedestal and is running with it,
and the two guards are

25b059b8-1c0e-4d84-89ce-e3e636369f31-3
00:22:16.893 --> 00:22:21.559
exclaiming and one has dropped
his spear and and they look

25b059b8-1c0e-4d84-89ce-e3e636369f31-4
00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:22.350
surprised.

32cca4d7-f5bc-497b-aa9f-1e34e518730a-0
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:28.841
And the next picture It's a
cutaway of the front of the big

32cca4d7-f5bc-497b-aa9f-1e34e518730a-1
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:29.680
boat ship.

35f4a63a-b578-4429-82ab-7194c8062bc5-0
00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:36.014
Airboat and at the top we've got
one of the guards on the

35f4a63a-b578-4429-82ab-7194c8062bc5-1
00:22:36.014 --> 00:22:41.221
pedestal. One is going down the
ladder, another is standing at

35f4a63a-b578-4429-82ab-7194c8062bc5-2
00:22:41.221 --> 00:22:46.346
the top with a crown pointing
down at the girl. She is at the

35f4a63a-b578-4429-82ab-7194c8062bc5-3
00:22:46.346 --> 00:22:47.090
very end.

17eee32c-a4a4-4083-8722-d541f458bb9f-0
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:54.119
Of a little protrusion from the
front of the air boat, the

17eee32c-a4a4-4083-8722-d541f458bb9f-1
00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:59.937
gilded cages at her feet. The
door is open, the purple bird is

17eee32c-a4a4-4083-8722-d541f458bb9f-2
00:22:59.937 --> 00:23:05.479
flying off with its long tail
feathers trailing behind, and

17eee32c-a4a4-4083-8722-d541f458bb9f-3
00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:09.820
her red chalk is also next to
the gilded cage.

280e37d7-0598-44b8-b0fa-57c63b9ad643-0
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:17.364
With the cutaway of the ship we
see 1234 floors of the ship with

280e37d7-0598-44b8-b0fa-57c63b9ad643-1
00:23:17.364 --> 00:23:22.521
different kinds of gears and
pipes and the workings of

280e37d7-0598-44b8-b0fa-57c63b9ad643-2
00:23:22.521 --> 00:23:28.335
machinery, and one or three or
so people on each floor moving

280e37d7-0598-44b8-b0fa-57c63b9ad643-3
00:23:28.335 --> 00:23:34.336
about. And on the bottom floor,
heading in the direction of the

280e37d7-0598-44b8-b0fa-57c63b9ad643-4
00:23:34.336 --> 00:23:40.337
girl are three guards, and one
has emerged from the ship and is

280e37d7-0598-44b8-b0fa-57c63b9ad643-5
00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.650
on the little.

472a0f1b-023d-4506-b2c8-1c5c31be6f4c-0
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.270
Gangway to the little protrusion
that she's standing on.

0b0d62cb-1644-4203-a0ac-33ed76813610-0
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.390
Ah, the next picture the.

8c3202dd-898d-48c6-9a1e-02d1537afef3-0
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.220
Head guard with the Crown is
standing at the edge.

516744a5-6771-4c07-9b36-8dd92d75152d-0
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.530
Of the protrusion, and he has
dropped the red chalk.

8885a6d7-3f1b-4bf9-b714-85293e48e331-0
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.968
It's falling away from the boat
ship or the air boat, and two

8885a6d7-3f1b-4bf9-b714-85293e48e331-1
00:24:08.968 --> 00:24:12.842
guards are holding the girls.
One of her arms and she's

8885a6d7-3f1b-4bf9-b714-85293e48e331-2
00:24:12.842 --> 00:24:16.923
straining to pull away from
them, and the open gilded cage

8885a6d7-3f1b-4bf9-b714-85293e48e331-3
00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:20.590
is on the floor between the girl
and the head guard.

a686e8fc-2bff-427d-a038-6fbfccba2cf1-0
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.490
On the next page.

622da650-10e0-4469-8f28-dd412fd3e847-0
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:29.848
Oh dear. We're at the back of
the ship. We can see the

622da650-10e0-4469-8f28-dd412fd3e847-1
00:24:29.848 --> 00:24:35.685
propeller to the left and the
paddle wheels to the right, and

622da650-10e0-4469-8f28-dd412fd3e847-2
00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:41.240
they're little swirls like the
paddles are are turning and

622da650-10e0-4469-8f28-dd412fd3e847-3
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.324
generating some swirls in the
air. And we see an open

622da650-10e0-4469-8f28-dd412fd3e847-4
00:24:46.324 --> 00:24:51.220
structure with a gear, a couple
of gears and a big.

1c219653-6a46-4179-acd2-04304bdf5676-0
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.558
Like a steering a ship's
steering column, but it's

1c219653-6a46-4179-acd2-04304bdf5676-1
00:24:56.558 --> 00:25:00.250
lowering another cage with the
girl in it.

b6dab0ef-4f1f-40b7-8e53-b72c40510d00-0
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.570
Below the ship.

d4bd218d-8c86-4c41-8ad5-b545b28776e0-0
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.140
In the next page, we see the
girl. Oh, she's leaping for joy

d4bd218d-8c86-4c41-8ad5-b545b28776e0-1
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.586
in this cage that is suspended
among the clouds and a white

d4bd218d-8c86-4c41-8ad5-b545b28776e0-2
00:25:16.586 --> 00:25:20.810
bird with a long table. Or
perhaps, I'm not sure if it's

d4bd218d-8c86-4c41-8ad5-b545b28776e0-3
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.256
the same purple bird or not. It
does have a purple purplish

d4bd218d-8c86-4c41-8ad5-b545b28776e0-4
00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:30.073
tinge, has the red chalk in its
beak, and it's flying toward the

d4bd218d-8c86-4c41-8ad5-b545b28776e0-5
00:25:30.073 --> 00:25:34.890
girl. And on the next page there
are three progressive pictures.

a814b7d3-4b89-42e9-805c-650b1c19d1c4-0
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.924
One top of the other there is
the Purple bird sitting on the

a814b7d3-4b89-42e9-805c-650b1c19d1c4-1
00:25:38.924 --> 00:25:42.264
girl's shoulder and she is
holding the red chalk and

a814b7d3-4b89-42e9-805c-650b1c19d1c4-2
00:25:42.264 --> 00:25:43.210
drawing a line.

ae52734d-6613-4e50-88a7-ea47c71d24a2-0
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.781
And the next picture, the Purple
Bird has flitted off of her

ae52734d-6613-4e50-88a7-ea47c71d24a2-1
00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:53.234
shoulder and is hovering with
its wings extended and its tail

ae52734d-6613-4e50-88a7-ea47c71d24a2-2
00:25:53.234 --> 00:25:57.040
curling over the girl as she
kneels on the floor and

ae52734d-6613-4e50-88a7-ea47c71d24a2-3
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.493
continues to draw a couple of
straight lines. We have a right

ae52734d-6613-4e50-88a7-ea47c71d24a2-4
00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:05.659
angle, and in the third picture
it looks like the bird is

ae52734d-6613-4e50-88a7-ea47c71d24a2-5
00:26:05.659 --> 00:26:09.610
sitting on the floor. I don't
know what floor this is.

cb1ecb57-a456-4f73-9c7e-ffd1e127af53-0
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.564
And it's observing her
approaching, closing off a

cb1ecb57-a456-4f73-9c7e-ffd1e127af53-1
00:26:15.564 --> 00:26:20.250
rectangle with her red chalk,
and she's lying on her belly.

57e46fee-a1c3-4897-8273-622687cbc2d6-0
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.513
The next is a two page spread.
The girl is on a red flying

57e46fee-a1c3-4897-8273-622687cbc2d6-1
00:26:28.513 --> 00:26:34.320
carpet flying high over a castle
city. We see the cage that was

57e46fee-a1c3-4897-8273-622687cbc2d6-2
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.854
holding her off to the left.
It's empty now because she's on

57e46fee-a1c3-4897-8273-622687cbc2d6-3
00:26:39.854 --> 00:26:45.207
the red carpet. There's a puffy
cloud just beneath her and

57e46fee-a1c3-4897-8273-622687cbc2d6-4
00:26:45.207 --> 00:26:50.833
there's some other puffy clouds
among the turrets of the city

57e46fee-a1c3-4897-8273-622687cbc2d6-5
00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:52.920
that she's flying over.

00fa4041-0351-4f69-92fb-f14c460db329-0
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.170
And the purple bird is flying on
ahead of her.

37ba2789-8f85-4e7b-87b8-d70c8345b211-0
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.120
And the next two page spread.

3beb7165-d683-4f5b-865a-f8a0ba738e1e-0
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.830
It's turning into a night sky.
There's a little bit of dusky

3beb7165-d683-4f5b-865a-f8a0ba738e1e-1
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:15.414
light at the horizon and then as
you move up into the sky it gets

3beb7165-d683-4f5b-865a-f8a0ba738e1e-2
00:27:15.414 --> 00:27:20.744
darker and darker purple with
more and more flecks of stars to

3beb7165-d683-4f5b-865a-f8a0ba738e1e-3
00:27:20.744 --> 00:27:21.760
the left is.

2014e424-94e2-4a00-a8a5-a70f681dfed8-0
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.830
This is the end of the city and
and it looks.

2cea2eb8-3172-4429-ab8b-edea2b8482ec-0
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:33.131
Exotic, you know, with with the
A domed top and another turret.

2cea2eb8-3172-4429-ab8b-edea2b8482ec-1
00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:38.114
And then it looks like desert
expanse reaching across the page

2cea2eb8-3172-4429-ab8b-edea2b8482ec-2
00:27:38.114 --> 00:27:42.860
to the next page and a single
palm tree. At the base of the

2cea2eb8-3172-4429-ab8b-edea2b8482ec-3
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.922
palm tree there's some light and
I'm imagining maybe there's an

2cea2eb8-3172-4429-ab8b-edea2b8482ec-4
00:27:47.922 --> 00:27:52.984
open door and the purple bird is
also flying ahead of the girl.

2cea2eb8-3172-4429-ab8b-edea2b8482ec-5
00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:57.729
The girl is on the left hand
page on the red flying carpet.

2b30d9c2-eec9-48cf-af53-1409cecdcb89-0
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.723
And the bird is on the right
hand page, headed toward the

2b30d9c2-eec9-48cf-af53-1409cecdcb89-1
00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:04.520
ground, toward the palm tree.

8b5d177c-e070-431c-8f8e-fded041cca9d-0
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.149
Yes, on the next page, the
single picture. On this page,

8b5d177c-e070-431c-8f8e-fded041cca9d-1
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:18.108
the bird has landed on the
ground and is standing by the

8b5d177c-e070-431c-8f8e-fded041cca9d-2
00:28:18.108 --> 00:28:23.416
palm tree next to the door,
which is closed and the girl has

8b5d177c-e070-431c-8f8e-fded041cca9d-3
00:28:23.416 --> 00:28:28.549
landed. She's gotten off of her
red carpet and is standing

8b5d177c-e070-431c-8f8e-fded041cca9d-4
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:34.030
holding her red chalk, staring
at the tree and the closed door

8b5d177c-e070-431c-8f8e-fded041cca9d-5
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.510
in the next page.

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-0
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.934
And and it's dark the all the
picture now is looks quite

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-1
00:28:40.934 --> 00:28:45.872
nighttime ish. And the next
picture there are three pictures

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-2
00:28:45.872 --> 00:28:51.216
going diagonally down across the
page. The first, the girl, is on

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-3
00:28:51.216 --> 00:28:55.992
her hands and knees with one
hand on the doorknob, and the

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-4
00:28:55.992 --> 00:29:00.769
bird is flying up near her. The
next picture, the girl has

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-5
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:05.707
opened the purple door, and
there's light on the other side.

cd54c2a2-dfb9-421f-a763-4acc95324edf-6
00:29:05.707 --> 00:29:06.760
And the bird.

d6cf4771-0613-47ae-ab21-963ef913dd31-0
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.755
Is flying into the doorway and
then the third bottom picture,

d6cf4771-0613-47ae-ab21-963ef913dd31-1
00:29:11.755 --> 00:29:15.720
the girl herself is crawling
through the doorway.

6b7bfa98-f953-4435-a1b7-5a7989cbff0e-0
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.401
On the next picture, one big
picture on this page, we're back

6b7bfa98-f953-4435-a1b7-5a7989cbff0e-1
00:29:24.401 --> 00:29:24.980
to the.

cd62046b-8b41-4aaf-a53a-c3c603ee730c-0
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:31.363
Cityscape again, we we've got
the three Decker build houses

cd62046b-8b41-4aaf-a53a-c3c603ee730c-1
00:29:31.363 --> 00:29:37.298
all right next to each other.
The girl is climbing out of the

cd62046b-8b41-4aaf-a53a-c3c603ee730c-2
00:29:37.298 --> 00:29:43.519
mailbox and the purple Bird has
flown out just ahead of her. And

cd62046b-8b41-4aaf-a53a-c3c603ee730c-3
00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:44.860
there's a boy.

34b6cb13-16fd-42e7-b6cb-584d7191b119-0
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.113
Running toward them with his
arms open, holding a purple

34b6cb13-16fd-42e7-b6cb-584d7191b119-1
00:29:49.113 --> 00:29:50.020
piece of chalk.

a38c71b7-d493-46bd-8ee2-aae80a83fa35-0
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.050
Um.

0c7bc755-221f-4d4c-ba47-a0a5d9db93e2-0
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.148
I see the street lamp or the
street light with a walk signal

0c7bc755-221f-4d4c-ba47-a0a5d9db93e2-1
00:29:58.148 --> 00:30:03.423
and green light is illuminated
on it. On the next page the girl

0c7bc755-221f-4d4c-ba47-a0a5d9db93e2-2
00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:08.533
and the boy are together. The
boy has a striped shirt and the

0c7bc755-221f-4d4c-ba47-a0a5d9db93e2-3
00:30:08.533 --> 00:30:13.973
girl has a plain white shirt and
the boy is wearing sneakers like

0c7bc755-221f-4d4c-ba47-a0a5d9db93e2-4
00:30:13.973 --> 00:30:19.001
high top sneakers and the girl
just has nondescript shoes on

0c7bc755-221f-4d4c-ba47-a0a5d9db93e2-5
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:24.030
her feet. The Purple bird is
perched on the hand of the boy.

83008c91-0a71-48ab-a3f4-a40ae0be8e08-0
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.020
And he's holding the purple
chalk.

5809f1c1-f282-4425-b6a4-0bc6d153166d-0
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.749
And the girl is he's giving her
a hand up. She's on one knee and

5809f1c1-f282-4425-b6a4-0bc6d153166d-1
00:30:33.749 --> 00:30:37.996
holding the red chalk and
getting up, and there are three

5809f1c1-f282-4425-b6a4-0bc6d153166d-2
00:30:37.996 --> 00:30:42.609
pictures stacked on top of each
other on this page. The second

5809f1c1-f282-4425-b6a4-0bc6d153166d-3
00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:46.710
picture in the middle, the girl
has drawn a red circle.

82ae4cfc-9ea1-4efc-ba51-dbea3f25ddcf-0
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.740
The Purple bird is now perched
on a boy's shoulder.

c6a64088-dba8-4e88-84e6-3db8aa74b241-0
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:57.315
And he's looking at this circle,
and in the third picture at the

c6a64088-dba8-4e88-84e6-3db8aa74b241-1
00:30:57.315 --> 00:31:01.824
bottom, the girl is standing
back proudly with her hands on

c6a64088-dba8-4e88-84e6-3db8aa74b241-2
00:31:01.824 --> 00:31:06.334
her hips, smiling at her red
circle. And the boy is bending

c6a64088-dba8-4e88-84e6-3db8aa74b241-3
00:31:06.334 --> 00:31:11.069
over, drawing a purple circle,
and the bird has flitted off of

c6a64088-dba8-4e88-84e6-3db8aa74b241-4
00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:15.428
his shoulder and is hovering
with its wings extended just

c6a64088-dba8-4e88-84e6-3db8aa74b241-5
00:31:15.428 --> 00:31:16.180
above him.

86a4f814-cf8a-4f49-a4e5-026436bc8625-0

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:28.934
The boy and the girl are now on
a bicycle that has one red tire

b124e7ee-3149-4743-9092-90e17792fb23-1
00:31:28.934 --> 00:31:31.720
and one purple tire. The girl
is.

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-0
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:36.732
On the front seat
of the bicycle and the boy is on

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-1
00:31:36.732 --> 00:31:40.919
the back seat. It's a bicycle
built for two, and they're both

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-2
00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:45.173
pedaling. They both have their
chalk. The girls is in her back

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-3
00:31:45.173 --> 00:31:49.158
pocket and the boy is holding
his in his hand. The girl is

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-4
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:52.872
pointing ahead and the purple
bird is flying overhead,

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-5
00:31:52.872 --> 00:31:56.789
following them, and they're
going down a piece of roadway

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-6
00:31:56.789 --> 00:32:01.179
where there's a cutaway and you
can see bricks and pipes beneath

fce6503e-e6cd-47f1-978d-579bb7f3e00f-7
00:32:01.179 --> 00:32:02.260
them. All right. #END_journey

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:08.402
That was the story and it took
about 20 minutes, so a little

40429753-b463-440d-bf26-1a055f43bd9a-1
00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:14.372
longer than the 10 to 15 minute
window. OK, OK, so moving on to

40429753-b463-440d-bf26-1a055f43bd9a-2
00:32:14.372 --> 00:32:17.730
the next item, it is also a
story.

d9bcdc8e-686c-4caf-924a-3a2b3590c322-0
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:23.377
And do you want this all to
take 10 to 15 minutes? Yes

d9bcdc8e-686c-4caf-924a-3a2b3590c322-1
00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:28.209
please. Can you tell me how many
pages there are? This one? Let

d9bcdc8e-686c-4caf-924a-3a2b3590c322-2
00:32:28.209 --> 00:32:29.870
me just double check.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.200
I think it's um.

c22e1840-af8f-4c45-8f0c-3b43ee6690e5-0
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.140
Ohh.

37847ac0-74cc-467f-9c22-83d33c39643e-0
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.390
It's around 7 pages.

4aaffa93-6c46-4c89-a5aa-4929228f20da-0
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:52.970
7 spreads. OK, great. All
right, news story.

e8e69e3e-73f0-4d9d-83e3-8387721ca2e4-0
00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:00.150
#START_arrival_4 On the left
hand page, we've got 3691011  10

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:05.174
squares stacked, and in the
place where the 11th and 12th

e8e69e3e-73f0-4d9d-83e3-8387721ca2e4-2
00:33:05.174 --> 00:33:10.284
square would be, there's one
larger rectangle picture, and

e8e69e3e-73f0-4d9d-83e3-8387721ca2e4-3
00:33:10.284 --> 00:33:15.308
these are progressive images,
close-ups on a man taking a

e8e69e3e-73f0-4d9d-83e3-8387721ca2e4-4
00:33:15.308 --> 00:33:20.505
shower. The next picture he's
leaning over a sink holding a

e8e69e3e-73f0-4d9d-83e3-8387721ca2e4-5
00:33:20.505 --> 00:33:25.010
mirror. His face has lather on
it and he's shaving.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.950
The next picture is a close-up
of his hands buttoning his vest.

6c611df2-4953-423d-9ef5-dc833f950035-0
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:36.083
The next picture is a close up
of his hands tying his shoelace.

6c611df2-4953-423d-9ef5-dc833f950035-1
00:33:36.083 --> 00:33:41.214
The next picture is a close up
of his hands holding money, a

6c611df2-4953-423d-9ef5-dc833f950035-2
00:33:41.214 --> 00:33:46.093
piece of paper money and two
coins. The next picture is a

6c611df2-4953-423d-9ef5-dc833f950035-3
00:33:46.093 --> 00:33:51.392
close up of his hand with his
suit jacket showing at the wrist

6c611df2-4953-423d-9ef5-dc833f950035-4
00:33:51.392 --> 00:33:56.608
reaching for a hat. The next
picture is a picture of a street

6c611df2-4953-423d-9ef5-dc833f950035-5
00:33:56.608 --> 00:34:00.730
map. The next picture we have a
little distance.

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-0
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.573
Away from the street map and we
can see that the man is holding

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-1
00:34:05.573 --> 00:34:10.123
it and the next picture we've
moved a little bit further and

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-2
00:34:10.123 --> 00:34:14.449
we can see the whole man
standing with his hat on and his

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-3
00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:18.701
jacket holding the map. And
there is that funny little 4

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-4
00:34:18.701 --> 00:34:23.176
legged creature that isn't a
dog, isn't a cat, isn't a rat,

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-5
00:34:23.176 --> 00:34:27.651
isn't a fish, but looks like a
combination of them, not the

c50c5490-b6da-4138-b56a-7295c44258f8-6
00:34:27.651 --> 00:34:27.949
cat.

6a6541b2-20f2-4741-8d64-d296c9961774-0
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:35.585
The next picture at the bottom
where the 10th picture, the man

6a6541b2-20f2-4741-8d64-d296c9961774-1
00:34:35.585 --> 00:34:40.985
is walking along a street with
the little creature. It's almost

6a6541b2-20f2-4741-8d64-d296c9961774-2
00:34:40.985 --> 00:34:46.216
like tadpole shaped with legs
and a long tail. It's following

6a6541b2-20f2-4741-8d64-d296c9961774-3
00:34:46.216 --> 00:34:51.362
the man and in the bottom larger
rectangular picture we have

6a6541b2-20f2-4741-8d64-d296c9961774-4
00:34:51.362 --> 00:34:55.918
zoomed way out and we have a
picture of the city with

6a6541b2-20f2-4741-8d64-d296c9961774-5
00:34:55.918 --> 00:34:59.799
roadways and tall buildings and
other shapes.

bc9ff4c5-9873-461c-997a-47686e19ed6c-0
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.040
And clouds.

6b21f549-fd84-4584-b797-433212b3a93f-0
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.551
Um, the next page. We've got
three small square pictures at

6b21f549-fd84-4584-b797-433212b3a93f-1
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:12.480
the top of the and then a bigger
square picture underneath the.

6b21f549-fd84-4584-b797-433212b3a93f-2
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.332
Three of those we have a close
up of the map with some kind of

6b21f549-fd84-4584-b797-433212b3a93f-3
00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:19.720
writing that I don't recognize.

2106042e-d1e1-4f88-9a6b-650e5c2c0cb4-0
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.110
And then we move away a bit and
we have a.

b0c7a54f-7e9d-4b4f-83ac-7f18e53bb6ef-0
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.161
Perspective of the man squinting
at the map, and then we zoom a

b0c7a54f-7e9d-4b4f-83ac-7f18e53bb6ef-1
00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:35.393
little bit further away and he
is still standing, holding the

b0c7a54f-7e9d-4b4f-83ac-7f18e53bb6ef-2
00:35:35.393 --> 00:35:40.457
map, looking at it, and the
strange little creature is down

b0c7a54f-7e9d-4b4f-83ac-7f18e53bb6ef-3
00:35:40.457 --> 00:35:41.470
by his side.

a730b9a9-6fe1-4825-9b89-a9ec5fc7a34a-0
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.350
The big picture underneath all
of this?

db0f9163-a3c7-4aac-9a46-78f8ad5c9d39-0
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:53.144
There is a huge it looks like an
aqueduct with arches. So it

db0f9163-a3c7-4aac-9a46-78f8ad5c9d39-1
00:35:53.144 --> 00:35:58.438
soars up above the heights of
people and there are like four

db0f9163-a3c7-4aac-9a46-78f8ad5c9d39-2
00:35:58.438 --> 00:36:03.906
or five arches and maybe even
the sails of sailboats above it.

db0f9163-a3c7-4aac-9a46-78f8ad5c9d39-3
00:36:03.906 --> 00:36:09.200
And bottom of a boat. Oh again
we have more air boats. These

db0f9163-a3c7-4aac-9a46-78f8ad5c9d39-4
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.279
are boat shaped things moving
through the air.

0d03c613-91f7-4587-b148-ffd8430a8bac-0
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.487
Um, there's one passing through
one of the arches and others

0d03c613-91f7-4587-b148-ffd8430a8bac-1
00:36:18.487 --> 00:36:23.006
that are floating a number that
it's very busy. It's very busy.

0d03c613-91f7-4587-b148-ffd8430a8bac-2
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:27.525
Picture on the ground level, our
number of people standing, and

0d03c613-91f7-4587-b148-ffd8430a8bac-3
00:36:27.525 --> 00:36:31.550
there are a bunch of cones that
could look like teepees.

f865ca26-6e9c-4f07-81e6-5e2aecaf9984-0
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:38.098
You know they're cylindrical and
pointed at the end and standing

f865ca26-6e9c-4f07-81e6-5e2aecaf9984-1
00:36:38.098 --> 00:36:42.550
up, and a few of them have
circle openings somewhere on

f865ca26-6e9c-4f07-81e6-5e2aecaf9984-2
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:47.400
their side. And there are a
number of people standing on the

f865ca26-6e9c-4f07-81e6-5e2aecaf9984-3
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:52.409
ground level at the base of the
big aqueduct structure next to

f865ca26-6e9c-4f07-81e6-5e2aecaf9984-4
00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:57.578
the various Tipi structures. And
there are even a few creatures,

f865ca26-6e9c-4f07-81e6-5e2aecaf9984-5
00:36:57.578 --> 00:37:00.519
other creatures of different
shapes.

4ab7691b-6d24-450d-8a9a-2257fd5b5a1a-0
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.900
On the ground and there's
another winged creature flying.

d6fbf97c-6b28-4c7c-8919-732f00dbe8a1-0
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.640
All right, on the next page we
have 12 small squares.

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-0
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.073
With little vignettes. The first
one the the strange white

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-1
00:37:17.073 --> 00:37:21.658
creature with the curly tail
like a chameleon. It has a long

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-2
00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:26.317
a long slash of a mouth and it's
talking to another bird like

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-3
00:37:26.317 --> 00:37:31.202
creature that's standing next to
it. And the next square the man

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-4
00:37:31.202 --> 00:37:35.937
is standing to the left and now
we see a woman standing to his

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-5
00:37:35.937 --> 00:37:40.145
right and she has an open book
in her hands and the two

e695321e-b54f-4333-badd-1b6664842ef4-6
00:37:40.145 --> 00:37:42.250
creatures are on the ground.

c54c2966-13f1-49ac-a4e9-9f656d4b311a-0
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.250
Between them.

a2990125-d54e-4cc9-a27e-06528b41dd41-0
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.948
The next picture, the man
gestures with one hand, the

a2990125-d54e-4cc9-a27e-06528b41dd41-1
00:37:47.948 --> 00:37:51.929
other hand is still holding the
map, and he gestures toward the

a2990125-d54e-4cc9-a27e-06528b41dd41-2
00:37:51.929 --> 00:37:53.920
woman and she is looking at him.

013994c2-3997-47af-b24e-b4ac07e0b50d-0
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.793
In the next picture, ah, the man
and the woman are leaning toward

013994c2-3997-47af-b24e-b4ac07e0b50d-1
00:37:59.793 --> 00:38:04.276
each other. He's showing her the
map, and it looks like she's

013994c2-3997-47af-b24e-b4ac07e0b50d-2
00:38:04.276 --> 00:38:08.977
pointing on beginning to show or
explain something to him on the

013994c2-3997-47af-b24e-b4ac07e0b50d-3
00:38:08.977 --> 00:38:13.100
map. In the next picture, yes,
we see a finger pointing.

65bcc6c0-ee2b-4356-b452-4e67706643a0-0
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:21.042
to a drawing on the map of one
of the airboats. There are a lot

65bcc6c0-ee2b-4356-b452-4e67706643a0-1
00:38:21.042 --> 00:38:27.331
of airboats on that page, and
then the next picture the woman

65bcc6c0-ee2b-4356-b452-4e67706643a0-2
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:33.012
with long dark hair parted down
the middle is showing a

65bcc6c0-ee2b-4356-b452-4e67706643a0-3
00:38:33.012 --> 00:38:34.229
contraption.

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-0
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.446
It's cylindrical. It looks like
it has a telephone dial in the

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-1
00:38:41.446 --> 00:38:46.353
center of it, and a horn and a
lever and who knows what else.

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-2
00:38:46.353 --> 00:38:51.102
In the next picture we have a
close up of her hand going to

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-3
00:38:51.102 --> 00:38:55.455
one of the holes in the
telephone dial, and her finger

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-4
00:38:55.455 --> 00:39:00.283
is in it looking like it's going
to be rotating it. The next

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-5
00:39:00.283 --> 00:39:04.953
picture, her other hand is
reaching to a lever and pulling

65bc002d-9bb4-4cdf-81c8-841030a2e527-6
00:39:04.953 --> 00:39:07.170
it, and in the next picture.

ad4ee1ce-1314-404b-ac90-a7b9788196a0-0
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:11.559
Her hand that had been dialing
the phone dial is now reaching

ad4ee1ce-1314-404b-ac90-a7b9788196a0-1
00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:15.656
out at the base of the horn, and
a piece of paper is coming out

ad4ee1ce-1314-404b-ac90-a7b9788196a0-2
00:39:15.656 --> 00:39:19.241
in the next picture. She's
holding that little piece of

ad4ee1ce-1314-404b-ac90-a7b9788196a0-3
00:39:19.241 --> 00:39:23.082
paper like a ticket in her hand,
and she's pointing to some

ad4ee1ce-1314-404b-ac90-a7b9788196a0-4
00:39:23.082 --> 00:39:26.475
squiggles on it. The next
picture she is putting the

ad4ee1ce-1314-404b-ac90-a7b9788196a0-5
00:39:26.475 --> 00:39:29.420
little piece of paper in the
hand of the man.

a9b09eb0-bed6-4b2d-b1e3-e32164923037-0
00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.436
And in the next picture, the man
and the woman are leaning toward

a9b09eb0-bed6-4b2d-b1e3-e32164923037-1
00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:39.670
each other. She's holding up one
hand with three fingers.

490dcd1a-c8cf-429b-88d9-467de4c1c9f6-0
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:44.759
And she's holding something
round. I don't know if it's a

490dcd1a-c8cf-429b-88d9-467de4c1c9f6-1
00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:47.870
coin purse or a pair of glasses
in her hand.

bfac9582-7700-40da-aded-c169aca082e8-0
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.420
Um.

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-0
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:56.662
Next page. There's a big
rectangle at the top of the page

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-1
00:39:56.662 --> 00:40:01.572
with six smaller square pictures
underneath it, and we have a

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-2
00:40:01.572 --> 00:40:06.640
view of lots of people standing
on the ground looking up at the

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-3
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.708
air boats in the sky. One person
is pointing, another person is

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-4
00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:16.855
holding their hat while he tips
his head to look up. Someone has

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-5
00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:21.606
a bicycle. They're all just
standing, looking up one of the

c38b34c5-b5b3-46b6-ac36-8f72d8623894-6
00:40:21.606 --> 00:40:22.240
smaller.

7772d622-4066-4cb2-b005-48bf026663a7-0
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.610
Squares underneath it, the first
one.

c6481485-d138-46d4-b1f5-c363043ab286-0
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:31.637
Is a close up of the curve of
the bow of the air boat above

c6481485-d138-46d4-b1f5-c363043ab286-1
00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:37.441
the people on the ground, and
the next picture the airboat, we

c6481485-d138-46d4-b1f5-c363043ab286-2
00:40:37.441 --> 00:40:43.337
see more of it and it's closer
to the ground and there's a rope

c6481485-d138-46d4-b1f5-c363043ab286-3
00:40:43.337 --> 00:40:45.179
coming down from it.

88db5002-0b13-4367-b557-eb1bf04eb7cf-0
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:50.825
Then the next picture, the
airboat is on the ground, and we

88db5002-0b13-4367-b557-eb1bf04eb7cf-1
00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:55.051
can see something that looks
kind of like a big paddle wheel

88db5002-0b13-4367-b557-eb1bf04eb7cf-2
00:40:55.051 --> 00:40:59.345
and some smokestacks. And the
next picture we have a close up

88db5002-0b13-4367-b557-eb1bf04eb7cf-3
00:40:59.345 --> 00:41:03.155
of people's legs and feet
walking on a walkway. So I'm

88db5002-0b13-4367-b557-eb1bf04eb7cf-4
00:41:03.155 --> 00:41:07.588
imagining that they're getting
on board and that little strange

88db5002-0b13-4367-b557-eb1bf04eb7cf-5
00:41:07.588 --> 00:41:11.190
white creature is by the man's
feet getting on too.

c6793a4a-86c6-4ee9-aade-e0d566f58d00-0
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:17.777
The next picture looks like the
hands and wrists of a conductor

c6793a4a-86c6-4ee9-aade-e0d566f58d00-1
00:41:17.777 --> 00:41:23.495
with a hole punch punching the
ticket that the man is offering.

c6793a4a-86c6-4ee9-aade-e0d566f58d00-2
00:41:23.495 --> 00:41:28.855
And the next picture we see a
close up of the ticket taker.

c6793a4a-86c6-4ee9-aade-e0d566f58d00-3
00:41:28.855 --> 00:41:32.250
He's wearing dark glasses and he
has.

a29660cf-09fa-41d7-98a4-2ad30f9bd10c-0
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.690
Um, some kind of a hat on his
head.

1cb45e1e-3973-4893-a25d-028a21f07c74-0
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.600
And he's gesturing to go inside.

313961b5-7d0f-4e29-8460-c007153aca45-0
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.030
OK.

065631b2-42ef-4a1f-999c-cac7344a8f38-0
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.399
The next page there again, many
little pictures. The man is

065631b2-42ef-4a1f-999c-cac7344a8f38-1
00:41:49.399 --> 00:41:53.158
sitting on a bench and the
little white creature is jumping

065631b2-42ef-4a1f-999c-cac7344a8f38-2
00:41:53.158 --> 00:41:55.540
up onto the bench to sit next to
him.

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-0
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.727
The next picture, the woman is
sitting next to him with her

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-1
00:41:59.727 --> 00:42:03.156
little creature in her lap, and
there's some other people.

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-2
00:42:03.156 --> 00:42:06.818
There's somebody carrying a baby
in their arms and another man

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-3
00:42:06.818 --> 00:42:10.479
sitting in front looking at a
paper with a beard. And the next

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-4
00:42:10.479 --> 00:42:13.850
picture, it looks like the man
and the woman are having a

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-5
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.279
conversation, and he's kind of
shrugging his shoulders and

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-6
00:42:17.279 --> 00:42:20.592
holding his hands up, and she's
looking. And in the next

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-7
00:42:20.592 --> 00:42:24.428
picture, it's a close up of him.
He's gesturing toward his chest.

31ab1349-617e-4ec8-9e20-84a9d7773655-8
00:42:24.428 --> 00:42:25.939
And then the next picture.

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-0
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.946
He's opening up his jacket and
reaching to an inside pocket,

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-1
00:42:29.946 --> 00:42:33.733
and the next picture he's pulled
out a piece of paper, which

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-2
00:42:33.733 --> 00:42:37.458
looks like some kind of an
official document with a seal on

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-3
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:41.120
it and some writing, and a
picture. A picture of a person.

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-4
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.473
So like it might be an
identification piece of paper.

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-5
00:42:44.473 --> 00:42:48.508
And the next picture. The woman
is leaning forward a little bit,

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-6
00:42:48.508 --> 00:42:52.356
looking, perhaps concerned and
holding her hand to her chest,

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-7
00:42:52.356 --> 00:42:55.957
and her little creature is now
perched on the back of the

9e5e6341-c45f-4a79-a68e-d2cc4c039d60-8
00:42:55.957 --> 00:42:56.329
bench.

2da4b284-638f-462a-9fa7-18ac586712ca-0
00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.841
The woman in the next picture
leans over to the other side

2da4b284-638f-462a-9fa7-18ac586712ca-1
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:04.717
into her little bag and is
reaching into the bag and the

2da4b284-638f-462a-9fa7-18ac586712ca-2
00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:08.796
next picture she's pulled out a
similar piece of paper that

2da4b284-638f-462a-9fa7-18ac586712ca-3
00:43:08.796 --> 00:43:13.080
she's shown to the man. And in
the next picture we get a close

2da4b284-638f-462a-9fa7-18ac586712ca-4
00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.364
up and it might be the woman,
but at a much younger age, or it

2da4b284-638f-462a-9fa7-18ac586712ca-5
00:43:17.364 --> 00:43:18.519
could be a child.

be5d526d-a99b-432b-ab2f-c7721c39d94e-0
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.787
It's a younger person with short
hair cropped above the chin.

be5d526d-a99b-432b-ab2f-c7721c39d94e-1
00:43:24.787 --> 00:43:29.457
Below the ear, and the last
picture on the page is a close

be5d526d-a99b-432b-ab2f-c7721c39d94e-2
00:43:29.457 --> 00:43:33.890
up of a somewhat sadder, forlorn
picture of this child.

e8112a2a-4c7f-41ee-b90a-3a7666ab2a39-0
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:40.003
Oh, on the next page we've got
12 more little pictures, and

e8112a2a-4c7f-41ee-b90a-3a7666ab2a39-1
00:43:40.003 --> 00:43:44.238
perhaps we're getting into the
story of this little child, the

e8112a2a-4c7f-41ee-b90a-3a7666ab2a39-2
00:43:44.238 --> 00:43:45.180
first picture.

923289f7-7d61-44fc-a111-6d96e3dd5c50-0
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:50.937
The child is holding a book and
holding it close and reading it

923289f7-7d61-44fc-a111-6d96e3dd5c50-1
00:43:50.937 --> 00:43:55.353
the next picture. Some bigger
hands are grabbing the child and

923289f7-7d61-44fc-a111-6d96e3dd5c50-2
00:43:55.353 --> 00:43:59.630
grabbing the book and the child
is recoiling and holding the

923289f7-7d61-44fc-a111-6d96e3dd5c50-3
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.696
book and the mouth is open and
the eyes are down. You can

923289f7-7d61-44fc-a111-6d96e3dd5c50-4
00:44:03.696 --> 00:44:05.660
imagine the child saying no.

13fc5019-4ed3-416f-bac3-b40d9515d5f0-0
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.595
And in the next picture the
bigger hands have taken the book

13fc5019-4ed3-416f-bac3-b40d9515d5f0-1
00:44:11.595 --> 00:44:16.705
and are placing the book in a
drawer. The next picture, the

13fc5019-4ed3-416f-bac3-b40d9515d5f0-2
00:44:16.705 --> 00:44:22.242
drawer is closed and locked with
a padlock. And the next picture

13fc5019-4ed3-416f-bac3-b40d9515d5f0-3
00:44:22.242 --> 00:44:27.522
the big hands and the body. But
mostly you just see the hands

13fc5019-4ed3-416f-bac3-b40d9515d5f0-4
00:44:27.522 --> 00:44:28.630
are grabbing.

10402073-1c1f-408e-935c-cb310baf9916-0
00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:33.532
One of the girls arms and a
shovel and forcing the shovel

10402073-1c1f-408e-935c-cb310baf9916-1
00:44:33.532 --> 00:44:37.994
into the girl's hand and the
next picture the big hands. One

10402073-1c1f-408e-935c-cb310baf9916-2
00:44:37.994 --> 00:44:42.749
hand is on the girl's shoulder,
the other hand is pointing down.

10402073-1c1f-408e-935c-cb310baf9916-3
00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:46.480
The girl looks downcast and is
holding the shovel.

8a9203f0-abd7-4391-b8c0-c6c58ef6d56c-0
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.072
And in the next picture we see
the girl beginning to labor,

8a9203f0-abd7-4391-b8c0-c6c58ef6d56c-1
00:44:52.072 --> 00:44:53.620
shoveling coal into.

e5638984-0368-403b-9c02-bf752ee06cad-0
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.259
A fire, like in an engine. And
the engine has an open portal

e5638984-0368-403b-9c02-bf752ee06cad-1
00:44:59.259 --> 00:45:04.076
and you can see the the light
coming out and the next picture

e5638984-0368-403b-9c02-bf752ee06cad-2
00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:08.737
she's released the coal into it,
and the next picture she's

e5638984-0368-403b-9c02-bf752ee06cad-3
00:45:08.737 --> 00:45:13.476
shoveling again. Oh, it looks
like we might have a change of

e5638984-0368-403b-9c02-bf752ee06cad-4
00:45:13.476 --> 00:45:18.526
seasons. So one picture, there's
rain, one picture there's snow,

e5638984-0368-403b-9c02-bf752ee06cad-5
00:45:18.526 --> 00:45:19.770
another picture.

5fd83be9-2f14-46af-ac17-ad44280cd224-0
00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:25.828
She it looks like it's very hot
when she stands next to it, or

5fd83be9-2f14-46af-ac17-ad44280cd224-1
00:45:25.828 --> 00:45:29.988
it's very smoky. And then
there's a next picture, there's

5fd83be9-2f14-46af-ac17-ad44280cd224-2
00:45:29.988 --> 00:45:34.435
a ladder against the furnace,
and she's climbing up it with a

5fd83be9-2f14-46af-ac17-ad44280cd224-3
00:45:34.435 --> 00:45:38.739
big brush going to the top. And
in the final picture, she's

5fd83be9-2f14-46af-ac17-ad44280cd224-4
00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:42.684
standing at the top of the
ladder, using the brush and

5fd83be9-2f14-46af-ac17-ad44280cd224-5
00:45:42.684 --> 00:45:45.840
putting it down the chimney of
the furnace.

d40111ac-e748-416f-a089-d9f2216f30c5-0
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:55.685
The next page is 1 big picture.
Looks like we're in some large

d40111ac-e748-416f-a089-d9f2216f30c5-1
00:45:55.685 --> 00:46:00.140
structure and there are lots of
little.

e0dbac5a-c382-4a58-8b6b-1ee0cd19317c-0
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:07.533
Walled off areas like cubicles,
but they're, you know, rock

e0dbac5a-c382-4a58-8b6b-1ee0cd19317c-1
00:46:07.533 --> 00:46:13.459
walls and they're all outside a
huge structure, which might be

e0dbac5a-c382-4a58-8b6b-1ee0cd19317c-2
00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:19.478
the big furnace. And in each of
the little bays or cubicles are

e0dbac5a-c382-4a58-8b6b-1ee0cd19317c-3
00:46:19.478 --> 00:46:24.840
people, perhaps children,
shoveling coal into the little

e0dbac5a-c382-4a58-8b6b-1ee0cd19317c-4
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:30.860
openings to fuel the big furnace
and we see little smokestacks.

3b2bae3c-9bda-405c-b0e4-259dadc72703-0
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.770
And there's one person cleaning
one smokestack.

b045ce39-8190-4ae5-9aae-9ba10c6494f6-0
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.619
On the next page we get close up
pictures again. The 1st is a

b045ce39-8190-4ae5-9aae-9ba10c6494f6-1
00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:44.520
picture of the girl sitting
cross legged on the ground,

b045ce39-8190-4ae5-9aae-9ba10c6494f6-2
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.610
holding her head in her hands.

0a54709c-fea3-4514-8eb2-71e8a844aa49-0
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:52.508
The next picture she's standing
up holding the shovel, looking

0a54709c-fea3-4514-8eb2-71e8a844aa49-1
00:46:52.508 --> 00:46:57.526
at a closed door, and the next
picture she's wedged the shovel

0a54709c-fea3-4514-8eb2-71e8a844aa49-2
00:46:57.526 --> 00:47:02.545
in the opening between the door
and the wall, and she's trying

0a54709c-fea3-4514-8eb2-71e8a844aa49-3
00:47:02.545 --> 00:47:03.740
to pry it open.

37e2cf8e-593a-4f58-8791-3da14e9c87b1-0
00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:10.002
And the next picture, it looks
like she succeeded in prying the

37e2cf8e-593a-4f58-8791-3da14e9c87b1-1
00:47:10.002 --> 00:47:15.265
door open. And the next picture
she's picking up a ring of keys.

37e2cf8e-593a-4f58-8791-3da14e9c87b1-2
00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:20.447
In the next picture she's taken
the keys to the drawer with the

37e2cf8e-593a-4f58-8791-3da14e9c87b1-3
00:47:20.447 --> 00:47:24.739
padlock. One key is in the
padlock and the it's been

37e2cf8e-593a-4f58-8791-3da14e9c87b1-4
00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:29.840
unlocked and the drawer is open
and her hands are reaching in.

37e2cf8e-593a-4f58-8791-3da14e9c87b1-5
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.780
And the next picture? She's
walking quickly away, clutching.

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-0
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:40.050
The open book to her chest. The
next picture we zoom out and we

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-1
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:44.682
see her smaller figure amidst
the much bigger structures

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-2
00:47:44.682 --> 00:47:49.721
walking away. The next picture
we have a close up of the girl

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-3
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:55.084
kneeling up into some kind of an
opening, and in the next picture

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-4
00:47:55.084 --> 00:47:59.635
we see her huddled in the
opening with the book next to

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-5
00:47:59.635 --> 00:48:03.536
her. And then in the next
picture we see a long

f5d9e21b-be7b-4102-9799-4bd813cdde6a-6
00:48:03.536 --> 00:48:04.429
locomotive.

3e11415f-8345-48d8-858f-5cc58227578a-0
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.217
Train with many cars behind it
and there's a one door and you

3e11415f-8345-48d8-858f-5cc58227578a-1
00:48:09.217 --> 00:48:13.294
can imagine that you see the
girl sitting in one of those

3e11415f-8345-48d8-858f-5cc58227578a-2
00:48:13.294 --> 00:48:14.560
cars on the train.

946e5b21-0735-4391-87db-34f4b58e4894-0
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:24.312
The next page there's one big
picture on the top half of the

946e5b21-0735-4391-87db-34f4b58e4894-1
00:48:24.312 --> 00:48:30.108
page with a an airboat and its
smokestack sailing through the

946e5b21-0735-4391-87db-34f4b58e4894-2
00:48:30.108 --> 00:48:35.530
air, through this city, with
buildings, with advertising.

f1745e78-cd56-4be9-a9c5-43d23735d527-0
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.940
Pictures and writing on it.

918fbe32-8877-4cf7-9746-df9c8ed53ac3-0
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:43.967
And underneath it are six small
close-up pictures. One is the

918fbe32-8877-4cf7-9746-df9c8ed53ac3-1
00:48:43.967 --> 00:48:48.030
man and the woman sitting on the
bench on the air boat.

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-0
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:54.369
Her creatures in her lap, and
his creature is next to him. The

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-1
00:48:54.369 --> 00:48:58.757
next picture there's a man in a
uniform, like a conductor, with

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-2
00:48:58.757 --> 00:49:02.733
a big megaphone holding it to
his mouth, so he's probably

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-3
00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:07.052
making an announcement. In the
next picture, it looks like the

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-4
00:49:07.052 --> 00:49:10.823
airboat is coming in for a
landing, and there are some

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-5
00:49:10.823 --> 00:49:14.457
people standing on the ground
near where the boat is

607971d3-c0dd-4374-a16c-c9cebc8753ff-6
00:49:14.457 --> 00:49:15.280
approaching.

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-0
00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:20.126
And the next picture we have a
close up of the man and the

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-1
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:24.527
woman shaking hands. The man is
standing up. The woman is still

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-2
00:49:24.527 --> 00:49:28.859
sitting down. And next picture
we have a close up of the man's

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-3
00:49:28.859 --> 00:49:33.191
legs and feet walking away, and
the white creature is trailing

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-4
00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:37.454
along. And in the last picture
on this little page or on this

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-5
00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:41.923
page is the man, his face. He's
holding his hand to his chin and

2c586f1e-d1fb-4af4-80f6-47072065f768-6
00:49:41.923 --> 00:49:44.329
he's tilting his face, looking
up.

0eff800c-ff9b-43da-80ca-450df9a8f82f-0
00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:50.475
With a puzzled expression, or a
wandering expression, and the

0eff800c-ff9b-43da-80ca-450df9a8f82f-1
00:49:50.475 --> 00:49:55.704
next page. It's one big picture,
and we're standing behind the

0eff800c-ff9b-43da-80ca-450df9a8f82f-2
00:49:55.704 --> 00:49:58.360
man, looking at his silhouetted.

ebc1aa11-f6e7-4f58-b5d1-5f3c718fda6d-0
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:06.868
Standing up looking out over
more of this strange city with a

ebc1aa11-f6e7-4f58-b5d1-5f3c718fda6d-1
00:50:06.868 --> 00:50:13.048
huge much bigger than life
statue of a squirrel like

ebc1aa11-f6e7-4f58-b5d1-5f3c718fda6d-2
00:50:13.048 --> 00:50:15.730
creature in the center.

3da0d768-a9d5-4bf4-ad6c-1593fc58861f-0
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:23.692
Around you can see walkways and
pathways and another turning

3da0d768-a9d5-4bf4-ad6c-1593fc58861f-1
00:50:23.692 --> 00:50:27.570
wheel and little creatures and
smoke and.

15e76cae-53a0-4141-981a-9623c1e08dcf-0
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:30.380
That's what we see.

1ebb398c-9c84-4b9d-a066-31d467573c01-0
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.080
Ohh my the next page has many
small square pictures.

99f503ae-3531-4d77-87f3-a1e77327f12e-0
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:45.171
We have a close up of the man
walking on the street next to

99f503ae-3531-4d77-87f3-a1e77327f12e-1
00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:45.480
some.

e57bb101-49f5-44cc-8e94-b5cd00b0eb04-0
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:51.117
Advertising on the wall, writing
on the wall, and the little

e57bb101-49f5-44cc-8e94-b5cd00b0eb04-1
00:50:51.117 --> 00:50:56.013
creature is trotting alongside
the next picture. We're zoomed

e57bb101-49f5-44cc-8e94-b5cd00b0eb04-2
00:50:56.013 --> 00:51:00.830
out and we have a bigger view of
landscape, the street, more

e57bb101-49f5-44cc-8e94-b5cd00b0eb04-3
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:01.620
buildings.

fc2306e0-3a01-46aa-a356-4b8448f95d77-0
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.551
Number like a dozen or more
people on the street and little

fc2306e0-3a01-46aa-a356-4b8448f95d77-1
00:51:06.551 --> 00:51:10.854
creatures and the next little
picture. We have a close up of

fc2306e0-3a01-46aa-a356-4b8448f95d77-2
00:51:10.854 --> 00:51:15.297
two people. Neither is the man
that we've been following, they

fc2306e0-3a01-46aa-a356-4b8448f95d77-3
00:51:15.297 --> 00:51:15.649
have.

1fb6af22-4141-4bc1-8364-4e8bc1e4569a-0
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:20.851
Different kinds of hats. One
looks like a Beanie hat and I'm

1fb6af22-4141-4bc1-8364-4e8bc1e4569a-1
00:51:20.851 --> 00:51:24.449
not. The other might be a
fedora, and there are some

1fb6af22-4141-4bc1-8364-4e8bc1e4569a-2
00:51:24.449 --> 00:51:28.454
strange like octopus tentacles
reaching over a wall, and I

1fb6af22-4141-4bc1-8364-4e8bc1e4569a-3
00:51:28.454 --> 00:51:32.188
don't know what they are. I
don't really think they're

1fb6af22-4141-4bc1-8364-4e8bc1e4569a-4
00:51:32.188 --> 00:51:33.410
octopus tentacles.

aacd5ea4-d7c5-4c7e-9272-4a83ff8ed7b8-0
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:39.338
The next picture there is a
woman, not the woman who was on

aacd5ea4-d7c5-4c7e-9272-4a83ff8ed7b8-1
00:51:39.338 --> 00:51:44.135
the air boat approaching a wall,
and there's an open little door

aacd5ea4-d7c5-4c7e-9272-4a83ff8ed7b8-2
00:51:44.135 --> 00:51:48.416
and she's reaching in to take
something out. And the next

aacd5ea4-d7c5-4c7e-9272-4a83ff8ed7b8-3
00:51:48.416 --> 00:51:52.845
picture we have a close up of
two elderly people. There's a

aacd5ea4-d7c5-4c7e-9272-4a83ff8ed7b8-4
00:51:52.845 --> 00:51:54.100
man with a beret.

1d1f2969-b07a-43c6-adb0-24e7419be068-0
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:59.346
And a woman holding a box with a
fish like creature peering out

1d1f2969-b07a-43c6-adb0-24e7419be068-1
00:51:59.346 --> 00:52:03.250
of it and the man is almost nose
to nose with the fish as they

1d1f2969-b07a-43c6-adb0-24e7419be068-2
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.490
stare at each other.

6adf3cec-e75b-4654-a020-7e697d311175-0
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.565
Next picture we assumed out and
we see the street with a number

6adf3cec-e75b-4654-a020-7e697d311175-1
00:52:10.565 --> 00:52:13.640
of people and animals, creatures
walking.

906d504d-9ccc-4bde-868b-4caaf68c21ba-0
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.495
The next picture is a close up
of the man's hands holding an

906d504d-9ccc-4bde-868b-4caaf68c21ba-1
00:52:18.495 --> 00:52:22.676
open book, and it has pictures
and words. So I see a picture of

906d504d-9ccc-4bde-868b-4caaf68c21ba-2
00:52:22.676 --> 00:52:26.465
an apple and then some writing
and a picture of maybe the

906d504d-9ccc-4bde-868b-4caaf68c21ba-3
00:52:26.465 --> 00:52:30.385
bottle of milk and some writing
and a picture of a wedge of

906d504d-9ccc-4bde-868b-4caaf68c21ba-4
00:52:30.385 --> 00:52:34.370
cheese and some writing and a
picture of bread and a picture

906d504d-9ccc-4bde-868b-4caaf68c21ba-5
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:36.199
of a fish. So maybe this is.

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-0
00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:42.127
How you can know the language.
The next picture he's holding

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-1
00:52:42.127 --> 00:52:46.689
the book and looking off to one
side and seeing a creature by a

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-2
00:52:46.689 --> 00:52:50.680
wall that has lots of little
doors on it. Oh, it's this

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-3
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.886
little white creature. And in
the next picture, the little

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-4
00:52:54.886 --> 00:52:59.376
white creatures up close to the
wall, extending its long curly

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-5
00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:03.510
tongue up toward one of the
little doors on the wall that

69becfea-7862-49f1-9d6a-8a57a944feb3-6
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:05.150
has some writing on it.

2df87b81-1593-4102-8947-2fffd1aa4874-0
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.079
The man has gone over in the
next picture and has opened the

2df87b81-1593-4102-8947-2fffd1aa4874-1
00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:11.440
drawer and it looks like.

46f3aeb2-7672-4722-ba8b-7c9b1693a483-0
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:18.501
Strange strawberry like fruits
in the drawer that he has opened

46f3aeb2-7672-4722-ba8b-7c9b1693a483-1
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:23.437
and in the next picture is a
close up of him holding the

46f3aeb2-7672-4722-ba8b-7c9b1693a483-2
00:53:23.437 --> 00:53:23.870
book.

77b30f01-0e56-439f-bec7-d4d96f652e04-0
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:27.150
With both hands and looking at
it.

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-0
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.621
The next picture there's a hand
reaching into the open drawer

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-1
00:53:32.621 --> 00:53:37.338
grabbing one of these strawberry
like fruits, but it looks like a

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-2
00:53:37.338 --> 00:53:41.698
young hand. And in the next
picture we see a young boy who's

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-3
00:53:41.698 --> 00:53:46.201
holding the strawberry fruit and
showing it to the man who was

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-4
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:50.847
standing there holding his book.
And the next picture we see the

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-5
00:53:50.847 --> 00:53:55.278
boy and a different man, a man
wearing suspenders and glasses

61f1c4d4-a65f-49f3-86c7-b19da4a8ccef-6
00:53:55.278 --> 00:53:57.780
and the man is waving and the
boy.

8f54c665-2384-4b0c-a280-7db57bac9ace-0
00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:03.274
They're both smiling and in the
next picture the boy is offering

8f54c665-2384-4b0c-a280-7db57bac9ace-1
00:54:03.274 --> 00:54:07.280
the fruit to our man with the
hat and the book.

2819d9f5-2c36-4289-aef5-7ebebfbbf94b-0
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.248
And he's backed away and holding
one hand up, gesturing no. And

2819d9f5-2c36-4289-aef5-7ebebfbbf94b-1
00:54:13.248 --> 00:54:17.669
in the next picture, he's
holding up his picture book and

2819d9f5-2c36-4289-aef5-7ebebfbbf94b-2
00:54:17.669 --> 00:54:22.623
pointing to a loaf of bread with
a questioning look on his face.

2819d9f5-2c36-4289-aef5-7ebebfbbf94b-3
00:54:22.623 --> 00:54:27.501
And the next picture, his mouth
is open, like he's talking, and

2819d9f5-2c36-4289-aef5-7ebebfbbf94b-4
00:54:27.501 --> 00:54:31.770
he's doing a chopping motion,
one hand on to the other.

245e177d-14b7-4ba6-9ed3-61a5ad284492-0
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.849
The next picture the other man
with the glasses is pointing to

245e177d-14b7-4ba6-9ed3-61a5ad284492-1
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:42.424
one of the doors or drawers in
the wall. And the next picture

245e177d-14b7-4ba6-9ed3-61a5ad284492-2
00:54:42.424 --> 00:54:46.704
he's opened the door and is
reaching his hand in. And the

245e177d-14b7-4ba6-9ed3-61a5ad284492-3
00:54:46.704 --> 00:54:50.911
next picture he has taken out
what looks kind of like an

245e177d-14b7-4ba6-9ed3-61a5ad284492-4
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:52.830
eggplant with a curly top.

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-0
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:57.629
The next picture, the man with
the glasses is making that

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-1
00:54:57.629 --> 00:55:02.223
chopping motion on his hand. Our
man with the hat is holding the

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-2
00:55:02.223 --> 00:55:06.323
eggplant up to his nose like
he's sniffing it. And in the

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-3
00:55:06.323 --> 00:55:10.634
next picture, the boy is smiling
and holding a big basket in

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-4
00:55:10.634 --> 00:55:15.016
front of him. And in the next
picture, the last on this page,

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-5
00:55:15.016 --> 00:55:19.469
the two men are looking at each
other. Our man with the hat is

aad8d850-61a7-4484-ae8d-557ac3a5ca8a-6
00:55:19.469 --> 00:55:23.640
holding the basket and has put
the eggplant in it and the.

31cf0e49-1cad-48d8-a246-caab5eea31c1-0
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:27.650
Boy is in front of the man who
might be his father.

8d5b0c9e-7504-4966-b94b-54124b2ef8bd-0
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.113
The next page has many little
pictures. The man with the

8d5b0c9e-7504-4966-b94b-54124b2ef8bd-1
00:55:36.113 --> 00:55:41.065
glasses is holding another
strange looking fruit that could

8d5b0c9e-7504-4966-b94b-54124b2ef8bd-2
00:55:41.065 --> 00:55:45.851
be the tail of a shrimp or a
strange carrot. And the next

8d5b0c9e-7504-4966-b94b-54124b2ef8bd-3
00:55:45.851 --> 00:55:48.079
picture the boy is holding.

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-0
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:54.226
A horn like thing, but it looks
like it has roots coming out of

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-1
00:55:54.226 --> 00:55:58.334
the narrow end and bubbles
coming out of the open end. And

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-2
00:55:58.334 --> 00:56:02.651
the next picture, the man with
the glasses has opened another

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-3
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:06.829
drawer and there's a leafy thing
in it and he's holding his

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-4
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:11.286
fingers to his lips like maybe
he's taking a little bit of leaf

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-5
00:56:11.286 --> 00:56:15.603
and sampling it in his mouth.
And the next picture the boy is

93f5aa68-3356-4f12-bf7f-8882616a17f6-6
00:56:15.603 --> 00:56:20.060
holding a really big strawberry
like fruit. It's as big as his.

2dffd363-d80b-465d-8be0-fca421153121-0
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.717
You know, he has to put both
arms around it to hold it. And

2dffd363-d80b-465d-8be0-fca421153121-1
00:56:24.717 --> 00:56:29.152
the next picture we have a close
up of the man's hands, the man

2dffd363-d80b-465d-8be0-fca421153121-2
00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:33.033
with the glasses, and he's
holding the thing that looks

2dffd363-d80b-465d-8be0-fca421153121-3
00:56:33.033 --> 00:56:37.329
like a clamshell with little
tentacles coming out of it. It's

2dffd363-d80b-465d-8be0-fca421153121-4
00:56:37.329 --> 00:56:40.933
partly open. And the next

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.048
A strawberry fruit with a very
long tail that looks like a

96b53f1d-9887-4805-b914-8ea57d77e8f8-1
00:56:48.048 --> 00:56:48.940
striped snake.

8c3f3c65-4d92-469e-8c38-8d0552fa0de9-0
00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:54.627
In the next picture, the man is
pursing his mouth. It's like

8c3f3c65-4d92-469e-8c38-8d0552fa0de9-1
00:56:54.627 --> 00:56:55.560
he's talking.

75f26021-9694-45e5-aa2d-d94ecdc78e77-0
00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.261
He's holding in one hand
something that looks like it

75f26021-9694-45e5-aa2d-d94ecdc78e77-1
00:57:00.261 --> 00:57:04.662
might be a sweet potato with
little roots shooting out from

75f26021-9694-45e5-aa2d-d94ecdc78e77-2
00:57:04.662 --> 00:57:08.623
it, and his other hand he's
holding up in a thumbs up

75f26021-9694-45e5-aa2d-d94ecdc78e77-3
00:57:08.623 --> 00:57:09.210

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.586
In the next picture, the man
with the glasses apparently has

05ea9067-e5a8-43f6-b493-a518a1c38999-1
00:57:14.586 --> 00:57:16.450

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:23.009
Fruit and is offering half of it
to our man, and the inside

0711f9a1-a578-47cd-96bd-d443bea54538-1
00:57:23.009 --> 00:57:28.743
almost looks like like a tomato.
The next picture the boy is

0711f9a1-a578-47cd-96bd-d443bea54538-2
00:57:28.743 --> 00:57:34.758
holding one of the not so large,
but still quite big strawberry

0711f9a1-a578-47cd-96bd-d443bea54538-3
00:57:34.758 --> 00:57:40.586
fruits to his open mouth. He's
ready to take a bite. The next

0711f9a1-a578-47cd-96bd-d443bea54538-4
00:57:40.586 --> 00:57:44.440

Sweet potato like.

eb7a7be7-d0fd-4ca1-9b88-2b6d8d4250b5-0
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:49.440
Tomato like fruit.

7988800b-a903-4097-b54d-7b40a695873a-0
00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:54.775
And he's chewing and looking
like he's considering what he

7988800b-a903-4097-b54d-7b40a695873a-1
00:57:54.775 --> 00:57:59.584
thinks of the taste. In the next
picture, the little boy is down

7988800b-a903-4097-b54d-7b40a695873a-2
00:57:59.584 --> 00:58:04.245
on one knee, putting a little
piece of fruit into the mouth of

7988800b-a903-4097-b54d-7b40a695873a-3
00:58:04.245 --> 00:58:08.906
the white dog creature. And in
the last little picture on this

7988800b-a903-4097-b54d-7b40a695873a-4
00:58:08.906 --> 00:58:12.976

basket full of all of these

7988800b-a903-4097-b54d-7b40a695873a-5
00:58:12.976 --> 00:58:14.900
different kinds of fruits.

ba46af16-4ddf-4667-b4c1-24023a141084-0
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:20.215
The next page, there are three
little pictures at the top, and

ba46af16-4ddf-4667-b4c1-24023a141084-1
00:58:20.215 --> 00:58:23.712
then a big one big picture
underneath them. The boy is

ba46af16-4ddf-4667-b4c1-24023a141084-2
00:58:23.712 --> 00:58:27.527
whispering into his father's
ear. The next picture, the man

Both men are holding baskets
full of produce, and they're

ba46af16-4ddf-4667-b4c1-24023a141084-5
00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:38.780
smiling. And the next picture?
It's the boy with a basket of

ba46af16-4ddf-4667-b4c1-24023a141084-6
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.850
produce, and he's pointing off
in the distance. And the picture

ba46af16-4ddf-4667-b4c1-24023a141084-7
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:46.474
underneath them all is a big
picture showing more of the

{Oh my gosh, this is more than
7.}

1bbf0c6d-ee81-4293-bacd-fd1562ca4371-0
00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.660
{Um, how long has this been?}

07f0f824-8055-44ae-a94f-ebfc8caa8ed0-0
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.025

00:59:17.025 --> 00:59:21.566
last page. OK. } So here we have
lots of little pictures. The boy

07f0f824-8055-44ae-a94f-ebfc8caa8ed0-2
00:59:21.566 --> 00:59:25.899

097cf8d5-2372-437b-9a2a-02d0b8434c31-2
01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:21.824
next page there are series of
pictures. Ah, the King has drawn

097cf8d5-2372-437b-9a2a-02d0b8434c31-3
01:10:21.824 --> 01:10:26.119
a sword and is now holding the
sword and pointing it at the

097cf8d5-2372-437b-9a2a-02d0b8434c31-4
01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:27.480
guard with the box.

8f152ab9-342f-4531-b23a-f5fc8a5ffa90-0
01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:34.550
And then the man, the guard with
the box, holds up the box and

8f152ab9-342f-4531-b23a-f5fc8a5ffa90-1
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:40.412
the crayons are all leaping off
of the king and off of his sash

8f152ab9-342f-4531-b23a-f5fc8a5ffa90-2
01:10:40.412 --> 01:10:45.725
and into the box. Even even
though sword that he drew and

8f152ab9-342f-4531-b23a-f5fc8a5ffa90-3
01:10:45.725 --> 01:10:50.854
the armed guards are now
grabbing the king with two arm

8f152ab9-342f-4531-b23a-f5fc8a5ffa90-4
01:10:50.854 --> 01:10:56.533
with both arms and the man, the
guard with the box is running

8f152ab9-342f-4531-b23a-f5fc8a5ffa90-5
01:10:56.533 --> 01:10:56.900
off.

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-0
01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:04.108
And the next picture, the boy,
the man, the girl, the Purple

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-1
01:11:04.108 --> 01:11:08.832
bird are all together and the
man with the box is approaching

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-2
01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:13.328
them. The boy takes out his
purple crayon and is drawing a

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-3
01:11:13.328 --> 01:11:17.671
wing, and in the next picture
the wing is now a complete

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-4
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:22.396
Griffin that the boy, the girl
and the man are on the back of

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-5
01:11:22.396 --> 01:11:26.968
and flying off into the night
sky with the full moon behind

e581b6c0-67cc-4499-8697-9c5d409e54e8-6
01:11:26.968 --> 01:11:28.340
them in the water.

aa56e0d3-8c57-4c1f-9faa-cdcfa76769a7-0
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:33.696
Beneath them and the guard with
the box at the top of the turret

aa56e0d3-8c57-4c1f-9faa-cdcfa76769a7-1
01:11:33.696 --> 01:11:35.730
reaching out toward them.

5b51aa06-1e75-4a52-bb52-8002c6b96212-0
01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:44.518
{Next picture ohh my ohh my} the
guards are all back in the

5b51aa06-1e75-4a52-bb52-8002c6b96212-1
01:11:44.518 --> 01:11:49.640
Dragon ship with the king and
the guard with the crown is

5b51aa06-1e75-4a52-bb52-8002c6b96212-2
01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.292
holding the box and cranking in
the Purple Griffin the the tail

5b51aa06-1e75-4a52-bb52-8002c6b96212-3
01:11:55.292 --> 01:12:01.032
feathers. The wing feathers are
beginning to go into the box and

5b51aa06-1e75-4a52-bb52-8002c6b96212-4
01:12:01.032 --> 01:12:06.242
the crayon has lept for the
boy's hand and is heading into

5b51aa06-1e75-4a52-bb52-8002c6b96212-5
01:12:06.242 --> 01:12:10.569
the box and the boy is reaching
for that Crayon.

9cda6cc6-a4bc-4169-8929-dd1be73e4ee2-0
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.723
The girl is being held by her
father protectively, and she's

9cda6cc6-a4bc-4169-8929-dd1be73e4ee2-1
01:12:14.723 --> 01:12:16.250
clutching her red crayon.

66e393a5-448e-45c7-a057-a583c1409191-0
01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:29.980
Ohh dear and now the Dragon ship
is in the air.

8cfbdbe2-2c3d-4919-b683-d7f1d1d7d32c-0
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.987
The last feathers of the Griffin
are being scooped into the box

8cfbdbe2-2c3d-4919-b683-d7f1d1d7d32c-1
01:12:35.987 --> 01:12:40.475
held by the guard with the
helmet. The boy has been caught

8cfbdbe2-2c3d-4919-b683-d7f1d1d7d32c-2
01:12:40.475 --> 01:12:45.039
by his hand by the king, who's
reached over the side of the

8cfbdbe2-2c3d-4919-b683-d7f1d1d7d32c-3
01:12:45.039 --> 01:12:49.526
boat. The girl and her father
are holding hands, and she's

8cfbdbe2-2c3d-4919-b683-d7f1d1d7d32c-4
01:12:49.526 --> 01:12:54.166
holding on to the purple bird as
well as the red crayon, and

8cfbdbe2-2c3d-4919-b683-d7f1d1d7d32c-5
01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.840
they're still falling.

bdd22873-3417-4cff-bdab-52ca1baf9f45-0
01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:04.699
The next picture, the girl and
her father and the bird have

bdd22873-3417-4cff-bdab-52ca1baf9f45-1
01:13:04.699 --> 01:13:09.626
fallen into the water and now we
see fish swimming around and the

bdd22873-3417-4cff-bdab-52ca1baf9f45-2
01:13:09.626 --> 01:13:13.060
crown that was on the girl's
head has fallen.

784559cc-bd15-4b65-818b-f1daec08ba45-0
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.598
Deep, almost toward the bottom,
and the man and her, his

784559cc-bd15-4b65-818b-f1daec08ba45-1
01:13:18.598 --> 01:13:23.612
daughter, are midway down into
the water and the next picture

784559cc-bd15-4b65-818b-f1daec08ba45-2
01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:28.140
the girl takes her red crayon
and is drawing something.

f94460de-eafa-44be-9dcb-fbb50f2bd4d0-0
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:37.110
The next picture that something
turns into a red submarine and

f94460de-eafa-44be-9dcb-fbb50f2bd4d0-1
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:41.713
the girl and her father are in
it. The girl is at the Periscope

f94460de-eafa-44be-9dcb-fbb50f2bd4d0-2
01:13:41.713 --> 01:13:46.028
and the father is down below.
Perhaps he's steering and the

f94460de-eafa-44be-9dcb-fbb50f2bd4d0-3
01:13:46.028 --> 01:13:50.487
purple bird is perched in there
and we have a little bit of a

f94460de-eafa-44be-9dcb-fbb50f2bd4d0-4
01:13:50.487 --> 01:13:52.070
underwater scape with.

cfa2d267-458b-47ba-8434-7a6e9b1b080a-0
01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.590
Things that are growing under
the water.

070fa71b-8ca2-42a5-bc27-c70cb62d0839-0
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:07.358
The next two pages spread. The
red submarine has come into a

070fa71b-8ca2-42a5-bc27-c70cb62d0839-1
01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:14.826
cave and has surfaced. The man
and the girl are standing on top

070fa71b-8ca2-42a5-bc27-c70cb62d0839-2
01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:16.810
of the submarine.

64c81dbc-ba1c-453f-8716-3e9b25dea7d0-0
01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.334
The Purple bird is flying out
just above them and on The Cave

64c81dbc-ba1c-453f-8716-3e9b25dea7d0-1
01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:29.670
walls above their head they see
rock drawings showing.

90750edc-2b7a-434f-8dd4-004a1a08e59d-0
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.460
People and boats and balloons.

02fcedc1-22db-474f-9655-753fc0f55930-0
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.180
And dragonflies and.

364bc50d-a738-4d5e-9307-086121d51aa3-0
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.210
It just kind of goes on and on.

a81900c7-3001-4b38-959c-d1c13a93fc1c-0
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:52.602
Now the man and the girl are
standing on the ground. The girl

a81900c7-3001-4b38-959c-d1c13a93fc1c-1
01:14:52.602 --> 01:14:57.478
is pointing up at some of the
drawings. It looks like one

a81900c7-3001-4b38-959c-d1c13a93fc1c-2
01:14:57.478 --> 01:15:02.774
stick figure is holding a magic
crayon above his head. Another

a81900c7-3001-4b38-959c-d1c13a93fc1c-3
01:15:02.774 --> 01:15:07.734
is a person oh, with the box
scooping up. And there's some

a81900c7-3001-4b38-959c-d1c13a93fc1c-4
01:15:07.734 --> 01:15:13.114
more pictures about that. Off to
the right we can see the mouth

a81900c7-3001-4b38-959c-d1c13a93fc1c-5
01:15:13.114 --> 01:15:14.460
of The Cave and.

e17aa631-495d-4aa7-978b-0273b2add576-0
01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.224
The water and rocks and clouds
in the distance, but coming back

e17aa631-495d-4aa7-978b-0273b2add576-1
01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:20.240
into The Cave.

524382d1-8914-4d6b-831f-dbb4b8455158-0
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.895
We've got the purple bird, the
man, the girl pointing up, and

524382d1-8914-4d6b-831f-dbb4b8455158-1
01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:28.750
then there's a little jutting
out of rocks and a wooden door.

78072d32-900c-4023-946a-8ef1f5e3ba53-0
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:37.653
In the next picture, the man and
the girl are hiding behind one

78072d32-900c-4023-946a-8ef1f5e3ba53-1
01:15:37.653 --> 01:15:42.231
of the rock pillars and we see
at the mouth of The Cave the

78072d32-900c-4023-946a-8ef1f5e3ba53-2
01:15:42.231 --> 01:15:45.359
dragon boat and the guards and
the king.

12637cc8-37d5-466a-92e2-c7e996d1c8e9-0
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:51.100
And the next page, there are
three little pictures. The

12637cc8-37d5-466a-92e2-c7e996d1c8e9-1
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:55.034
father is holding a crayon and
pointing up, and the girl is

12637cc8-37d5-466a-92e2-c7e996d1c8e9-2
01:15:55.034 --> 01:15:59.098
looking at him and the purple
bird is hovering. Next picture,

12637cc8-37d5-466a-92e2-c7e996d1c8e9-3
01:15:59.098 --> 01:16:02.900
the bird perches on the girl's
shoulder and the father is

12637cc8-37d5-466a-92e2-c7e996d1c8e9-4
01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.095
taking his black crayon and his
drawing a line. And in the next

12637cc8-37d5-466a-92e2-c7e996d1c8e9-5
01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:07.620
picture.

38e43be3-cbbb-419c-9fe5-76b308b6391c-0
01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.116
Ah, it's a rectangle with a
perch for the bird to sit on,

38e43be3-cbbb-419c-9fe5-76b308b6391c-1
01:16:14.116 --> 01:16:16.770
and the bird is now sitting on
it.

e8d5bc35-32a1-403e-beda-b5765f945d88-0
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.887
In the next picture, the man and
the girl are hiding again behind

e8d5bc35-32a1-403e-beda-b5765f945d88-1
01:16:24.887 --> 01:16:29.392
one of the rock structures, and
the guard with the box is

e8d5bc35-32a1-403e-beda-b5765f945d88-2
01:16:29.392 --> 01:16:33.509
rushing toward the purple bird
trying to capture it.

c88101da-d099-42fd-aaba-dfccb5a0cd07-0
01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:39.977
And the next page, there are
three little pictures. And the

c88101da-d099-42fd-aaba-dfccb5a0cd07-1
01:16:39.977 --> 01:16:45.487
bird is going into the box that
the guard is holding, and then

c88101da-d099-42fd-aaba-dfccb5a0cd07-2
01:16:45.487 --> 01:16:50.735
the guard gets caught in the
box. The box was a trap. There

c88101da-d099-42fd-aaba-dfccb5a0cd07-3
01:16:50.735 --> 01:16:56.508
were stores that were lying flat
that he used to walk up. And now

c88101da-d099-42fd-aaba-dfccb5a0cd07-4
01:16:56.508 --> 01:17:01.668
he snapped the trap and the
doors are coming up, the boxes

c88101da-d099-42fd-aaba-dfccb5a0cd07-5
01:17:01.668 --> 01:17:03.679
flown out of his hands.

be323740-dd35-4d63-b58d-193d85b26664-0
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.210
And in the next picture the.

56f31499-287b-4bb2-b777-487a1047abdf-0
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:13.327
The guard is trapped inside the
cage and the father has the the

56f31499-287b-4bb2-b777-487a1047abdf-1
01:17:13.327 --> 01:17:18.506
capturing box in his hands,
looks like he's about to throw

56f31499-287b-4bb2-b777-487a1047abdf-2
01:17:18.506 --> 01:17:23.685
it on the ground and they're
just two purple feathers. The

56f31499-287b-4bb2-b777-487a1047abdf-3
01:17:23.685 --> 01:17:28.688
next page he throws it on the
ground and what emerges is

56f31499-287b-4bb2-b777-487a1047abdf-4
01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:31.410
amazing and colorful we've got.

7cfe0378-c261-43a9-afb1-38050a8575f9-0
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:38.125
Blue and purple and yellow and
green and red streaks of color

7cfe0378-c261-43a9-afb1-38050a8575f9-1
01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:43.510
emerging explosively, and I see
the Griffin and lots of birds

7cfe0378-c261-43a9-afb1-38050a8575f9-2
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:46.290
and insects of different colors.

61183928-3efa-45f8-a0e0-80cb7f41852c-0
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:52.097
Just great light and explosion.
The man is closest to it, the

01:17:52.097 --> 01:17:56.928
girl is behind him, the guard is
still in the trap box, and then

61183928-3efa-45f8-a0e0-80cb7f41852c-2
01:17:56.928 --> 01:18:01.684
the king and the boy have gotten
off of the dragon boat and are

61183928-3efa-45f8-a0e0-80cb7f41852c-3
01:18:01.684 --> 01:18:04.360
walking through the colored
lights.

532226ff-8750-45a8-8101-655385d04248-0
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:10.285
toward the man and the girl and
the two guards still on the

532226ff-8750-45a8-8101-655385d04248-1
01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:14.340
dragon boat are cowering at the
sight of all of this.

b3383b4c-aa19-4310-bea3-bfebbaafe607-0
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:25.101
Man, the girl, the king with the
purple bird on his shoulder, and

b3383b4c-aa19-4310-bea3-bfebbaafe607-1
01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:30.131
the boy with a crown on his
head. Or standing at the edge at

b3383b4c-aa19-4310-bea3-bfebbaafe607-2
01:18:30.131 --> 01:18:35.078
the mouth of The Cave and the
dragon boat is going back out

b3383b4c-aa19-4310-bea3-bfebbaafe607-3
01:18:35.078 --> 01:18:39.777
and we see a big octopus
tentacle reaching up out of the

b3383b4c-aa19-4310-bea3-bfebbaafe607-4
01:18:39.777 --> 01:18:44.230
water to seize the boat, and
above we see the purple.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:50.146
Griffin flying off with the bird
cage with the other guard in it,

21b03cfe-ff4d-4d8c-9d23-978d7228742c-1
01:18:50.146 --> 01:18:55.115
and there's a flock of rainbow
colored birds flying out of The

21b03cfe-ff4d-4d8c-9d23-978d7228742c-2
01:18:55.115 --> 01:18:55.510
Cave.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.572
And the next picture. The girl
is hugging the man, the red

8cd0773c-42fb-4fd9-be53-831f5b1421da-1
01:19:01.572 --> 01:19:06.583
Crayon is sticking out of her
back pocket, and the dark crayon

8cd0773c-42fb-4fd9-be53-831f5b1421da-2
01:19:06.583 --> 01:19:11.832
is in his shirt pocket. The king
and the bird and the boy are off

8cd0773c-42fb-4fd9-be53-831f5b1421da-3
01:19:11.832 --> 01:19:16.922
to one side, looking on, and the
door in the little outcropping

8cd0773c-42fb-4fd9-be53-831f5b1421da-4
01:19:16.922 --> 01:19:21.854
of rock that I had described
before is now a little bit open,

8cd0773c-42fb-4fd9-be53-831f5b1421da-5
01:19:21.854 --> 01:19:25.990
and the tail of the red kites
just peeking through.

5802c82a-47ed-4fb4-b13f-28fd397f877d-0
01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:29.580
Ah.

ce1cbad6-ee10-4a85-8bd0-402bb181db1a-0
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:34.512
And now we are back
in the cityscape and the red

ce1cbad6-ee10-4a85-8bd0-402bb181db1a-1
01:19:34.512 --> 01:19:38.847
kite is flying overhead and the
tail trailing behind. And we've

ce1cbad6-ee10-4a85-8bd0-402bb181db1a-2
01:19:38.847 --> 01:19:42.979
got the cutaway of the street
and the bricks and pipes under

ce1cbad6-ee10-4a85-8bd0-402bb181db1a-3
01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:47.246
the street and the cutaway of
the house and the rooms and it's

ce1cbad6-ee10-4a85-8bd0-402bb181db1a-4
01:19:47.246 --> 01:19:49.550
blue sky with a few puffy
clouds. #END_return

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.660
So that was the story. How long
was that?

6da73a98-3a9f-49eb-a86b-30de4518e139-0
01:19:55.830 --> 01:20:00.271
It was. So we came back at 25
and now it's 45. So then 20

6da73a98-3a9f-49eb-a86b-30de4518e139-1
01:20:00.271 --> 01:20:04.562
minutes. That was 20 minutes. I
was trying to do that so

6da73a98-3a9f-49eb-a86b-30de4518e139-2
01:20:04.562 --> 01:20:05.240
quickly.

b259bc91-ee10-4700-a424-9b48c8438b18-0
01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:08.040
OK.

0d8d30cc-af05-4811-8571-ab42ad297d24-0
01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:13.552

scene, so please take between

01:20:13.552 --> 01:20:17.919
three and five minutes to
describe it. OK? Are you allowed

0d8d30cc-af05-4811-8571-ab42ad297d24-2
01:20:17.919 --> 01:20:22.581
to tell me when I hit the three
minute mark, would you please?

0d8d30cc-af05-4811-8571-ab42ad297d24-3
01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:23.100
Great.

Umm.

d11ef3e6-2f95-45cf-9b07-0663ffe8eeb5-0
01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:31.278

page, and there's a purple
square with some text that says

d11ef3e6-2f95-45cf-9b07-0663ffe8eeb5-3
01:20:39.122 --> 01:20:43.243
making a splash. {Ever since

bright wiggly slides in the

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:15.041
So yes, we have a very busy
water park with green and yellow

1c8948e8-0ad8-46e3-9538-ea650ed03366-1
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:20.856
and red twisting water flumes
and the water is jam packed full

01:21:20.856 --> 01:21:21.780
of people.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:27.213
And there are more people lined
up around the edges waiting for

ee663f17-2912-41bd-a336-e404334b55f3-1
01:21:27.213 --> 01:21:30.514
a turn. And there's a pirate
ship in the middle of the water

ee663f17-2912-41bd-a336-e404334b55f3-2
01:21:30.514 --> 01:21:33.815
and people all over the pirate
ship, and there's a big slide

ee663f17-2912-41bd-a336-e404334b55f3-3
01:21:33.815 --> 01:21:37.008
out of the pirate ship that
children are sliding down, and

ee663f17-2912-41bd-a336-e404334b55f3-4

Big fun looking Curly Dragon

and swimming around it.

01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:56.188
Pink elephant creature that a
child is climbing on. Lots and

277dcc68-f884-4701-ba85-ec22a196c313-1
01:21:56.188 --> 01:21:59.040
lots of people in yellow inner
tubes.

7f7b6677-1d35-4962-aa5f-a26bc0f4c681-0
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:05.294
Ohh, there's a boy using a a
water gun spraying somebody else

7f7b6677-1d35-4962-aa5f-a26bc0f4c681-1
01:22:05.294 --> 01:22:10.115
who doesn't look like they're
enjoying it. There are people on

7f7b6677-1d35-4962-aa5f-a26bc0f4c681-2
01:22:10.115 --> 01:22:14.630
the edge on towels. Again, all
manner of color and lots of

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:19.375
other creatures. There's a a sea
serpent in the water. I mean

7f7b6677-1d35-4962-aa5f-a26bc0f4c681-4
01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:23.660
it's a it's a play thing.
There's some mushroom kind of

7f7b6677-1d35-4962-aa5f-a26bc0f4c681-5

de2efacc-b0c8-4892-bec7-1ef122ecb388-0

Again, play structures. There's
a rainbow slide with lots of

de2efacc-b0c8-4892-bec7-1ef122ecb388-1
01:22:31.692 --> 01:22:35.430
children's sliding down each of
the stripes of color.

b7f95a11-6688-4ab5-aeab-1cba1776fede-0
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:45.519
What else? Ohh the mushroom
things are like water showers so

b7f95a11-6688-4ab5-aeab-1cba1776fede-1
01:22:45.519 --> 01:22:49.643
people are standing underneath
and the water is pouring down on

b7f95a11-6688-4ab5-aeab-1cba1776fede-2
01:22:49.643 --> 01:22:52.220
them and I have not yet seen a
Penguin.

01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:58.079
Um, up there, I think is one
with a purple bow on its head in

614f9b53-837b-496d-89a6-f3c1fdee3699-1

some people. And there's another

01:23:05.130 --> 01:23:07.520
Maybe it's a red inner tube
around its middle?

c307d5e0-4083-4cdb-ae04-1015718753a4-0
01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:11.950

in a lifeguard.

buoys.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.640
How many more Penguins can I
see?

e634d0f1-bc9b-4ea0-bcd1-0d6648458c47-0
01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:33.508
Oh, there's a Penguin in one of
the water flumes on the green

e634d0f1-bc9b-4ea0-bcd1-0d6648458c47-1

01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:43.016
And there's a Penguin with a top
hat sitting on a wall with some

3a85d811-a14a-4cc2-a320-7eeb18d05d31-1
01:23:43.016 --> 01:23:46.461
other people sitting on the
wall. And there's another

Preserve her thing that she's
holding on to.

01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:56.970
There's a really big water
cannon at the top of the pirate

7a446e03-0e26-4b6a-b1d9-a676fb1a0408-1
01:23:56.970 --> 01:24:01.115
ship that's squirting on a man's
head, and he's not happy about

it.

387d39ba-eafc-4e0a-b04e-ef21ca1763ba-0

Is this another three to five
minute? Alright, will you tell

6ed0f029-1070-4860-a778-4393b757f830-1
01:24:32.747 --> 01:24:35.380
me when I get to 3 minutes,
please? Alright.

f6f0bfd9-a3ee-4841-95c2-34ce3ff34e5b-0
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:41.366
#START_campsite Two page spread
for where's Waldo? We have it

f6f0bfd9-a3ee-4841-95c2-34ce3ff34e5b-1
01:24:41.366 --> 01:24:46.185
looks like green camping grounds
and in the upper left corner is

f6f0bfd9-a3ee-4841-95c2-34ce3ff34e5b-2
01:24:46.185 --> 01:24:48.410
a postcard with a Waldo stamp.

f6491795-6dde-4d17-9edc-d3d70408edc5-0
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:54.457
{Um, and it says wake up Waldo.
Friends, have you ever seen

f6491795-6dde-4d17-9edc-d3d70408edc5-1
01:24:54.457 --> 01:24:59.569
mermaids in a canal, or flowers
painted all over a tent, or a

f6491795-6dde-4d17-9edc-d3d70408edc5-2
01:24:59.569 --> 01:25:04.929
line of hikers winding along the
country lanes? I have today? It

f6491795-6dde-4d17-9edc-d3d70408edc5-3
01:25:04.929 --> 01:25:10.124
was just amazing. Signed Waldo
to Waldo, friends. North of the

f6491795-6dde-4d17-9edc-d3d70408edc5-4
01:25:10.124 --> 01:25:14.000
South Pole. East of the West
Pole. The world.}

9611d902-a402-49b5-bb2b-869074bfff76-0
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.640
Ah.

aaf1903e-725b-45f6-a85d-81f5879bf125-0
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:19.800
And in this camping ground area.

12b5d251-f545-40e4-9c81-9b391cffaa3a-0
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:25.802
We have different squares of
greenery. There's one enclosed

12b5d251-f545-40e4-9c81-9b391cffaa3a-1
01:25:25.802 --> 01:25:31.128
green area with a hedge around
it that has two bowls. That one

12b5d251-f545-40e4-9c81-9b391cffaa3a-2
01:25:31.128 --> 01:25:35.862
is looking quite fierce, and
there's a person foolishly

12b5d251-f545-40e4-9c81-9b391cffaa3a-3
01:25:35.862 --> 01:25:38.060
shaking a red cloth at it.

f9969a56-a3c2-479a-8235-882ce766fa1f-0
01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:43.583
And then there's another bull
that's just kind of sitting

f9969a56-a3c2-479a-8235-882ce766fa1f-1
01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:47.174
there, and it has musical horns
on its head, not pointy horns on

f9969a56-a3c2-479a-8235-882ce766fa1f-2
01:25:47.174 --> 01:25:50.157
its head. And then there's
another bull in the corner

f9969a56-a3c2-479a-8235-882ce766fa1f-3
01:25:50.157 --> 01:25:53.030
wearing a Viking hat with the
horns and the helmet.

448f53c6-7616-4923-a3a6-6ebd1612206e-0
01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:59.500
And then there are walkways with
lots of people coming and going.

448f53c6-7616-4923-a3a6-6ebd1612206e-1
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.656
There are hikers, lots of hikers
with backpacks and walking

448f53c6-7616-4923-a3a6-6ebd1612206e-2
01:26:03.656 --> 01:26:07.950
sticks. There's even a Santa
Claus costume with a Santa pack.

c6aab075-dd2c-4d0d-a713-ada68c015fbd-0
01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.326
Um, some of the hikers have
collapsed on the ground. They

c6aab075-dd2c-4d0d-a713-ada68c015fbd-1
01:26:13.326 --> 01:26:15.570
look like they're struggling.

5ea8557d-d36f-42fa-87db-9700d9384d8a-0
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:17.450
Um.

4e1b8c9e-45b5-4137-a796-31d6c6c8cc07-0
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.020
Let's see, there is a canal
going through here. I don't know

4e1b8c9e-45b5-4137-a796-31d6c6c8cc07-1
01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:30.099
if I see a shark fin or not. And
then there's a duck and a duck

4e1b8c9e-45b5-4137-a796-31d6c6c8cc07-2
01:26:30.099 --> 01:26:34.464
on top of a Periscope and a
little gondola boat with a

4e1b8c9e-45b5-4137-a796-31d6c6c8cc07-3
01:26:34.464 --> 01:26:39.463
person with a pole and another
person riding in it. And then a

4e1b8c9e-45b5-4137-a796-31d6c6c8cc07-4
01:26:39.463 --> 01:26:43.748
party boat with a bunch of
people, very fit, muscular

4e1b8c9e-45b5-4137-a796-31d6c6c8cc07-5
01:26:43.748 --> 01:26:48.510
looking guys showing off and
waving at the people on board.

6f2264ce-bdf7-460d-97cc-c1c5a2e29da3-0
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:52.352
And then in front of that it
looks like a couple of mermaids

6f2264ce-bdf7-460d-97cc-c1c5a2e29da3-1
01:26:52.352 --> 01:26:56.052
waving at the other people. I
can see their blonde hair and

6f2264ce-bdf7-460d-97cc-c1c5a2e29da3-2
01:26:56.052 --> 01:26:58.150
their little fishy mermaid
tails.

08d62ebf-95c7-4fd3-adc0-f0c2929dbb89-0
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:04.644
Somebody with a fishing pole has
caught a boot and I see a bunch

08d62ebf-95c7-4fd3-adc0-f0c2929dbb89-1
01:27:04.644 --> 01:27:08.984
of fish sticking their heads out
laughing that he caught the

08d62ebf-95c7-4fd3-adc0-f0c2929dbb89-2
01:27:08.984 --> 01:27:09.340
boot.

21c2c6b7-9fd9-417e-b55a-e44ed7bd38cb-0
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:19.547
In the foreground, on the near
side, we have a campground area

21c2c6b7-9fd9-417e-b55a-e44ed7bd38cb-1
01:27:19.547 --> 01:27:27.261
with 1234567891011121314 at
least 14 tenths, most of which

21c2c6b7-9fd9-417e-b55a-e44ed7bd38cb-2
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:28.830
are pitched.

a721fb04-c751-4a21-98ff-4cba638f3ce9-0
01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:36.343
One has collapsed and people are
struggling to get it up. One is

a721fb04-c751-4a21-98ff-4cba638f3ce9-1
01:27:36.343 --> 01:27:40.260
covered in decorative flowers.
One is a tipi.

13b18db1-a55f-4f3a-aba5-ee13fd7f2ed4-0
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:44.761
But they're different shaped
tents. There's one tent with the

13b18db1-a55f-4f3a-aba5-ee13fd7f2ed4-1
01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:47.627
door open. The kids have opened
the door and there's a man

13b18db1-a55f-4f3a-aba5-ee13fd7f2ed4-2
01:27:47.627 --> 01:27:50.590
getting dressed, looking alarmed
that they're spying on him.

199dfb92-797c-4d40-a029-49c081177780-0
01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:57.383
And there are other people there
are sitting out among the tents

199dfb92-797c-4d40-a029-49c081177780-1
01:27:57.383 --> 01:28:01.140
and standing and walking and
families gathered together and.

db64c442-dafe-4596-9125-d81ce239e3c2-0
01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.230
Um, what else is going on? There
are some people having

db64c442-dafe-4596-9125-d81ce239e3c2-1
01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:10.700
cocktails, someone playing. Oh,
the the hippies are hanging out

db64c442-dafe-4596-9125-d81ce239e3c2-2
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:15.309
with the flower power tent and a
guitar and long hair and beards.

1c232fed-bc1e-4da6-b75f-b6ecd75590f8-0
01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:16.770
Umm.

e5803586-d4c9-45c9-91e0-d6dc153f4bba-0
01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:23.166
Let's see. And we do have Native
Americans reclining outside the

e5803586-d4c9-45c9-91e0-d6dc153f4bba-1
01:28:23.166 --> 01:28:27.770
Tipi. And then there's somebody
in the corner trying to blow up

e5803586-d4c9-45c9-91e0-d6dc153f4bba-2
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:30.720
a big yellow and red striped
inner tube.

41c948dc-0e5c-49e3-b947-a93e14740c29-0
01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:37.358
{3 minutes. OK. Well, let me say
a little bit more.} OK. On the

41c948dc-0e5c-49e3-b947-a93e14740c29-1
01:28:37.358 --> 01:28:42.583
other side of the canal, we have
the camper park. So there's a

41c948dc-0e5c-49e3-b947-a93e14740c29-2
01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:47.477
big green area and there are
12345678 9 campers and again,

41c948dc-0e5c-49e3-b947-a93e14740c29-3
01:28:47.477 --> 01:28:50.380
lots of people milling around
and.

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-0
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.742
I think somebody threw, either
threw a ball at the window or

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-1
01:28:56.742 --> 01:29:01.264
squirting a water gun at the
camper. No, I think it's a ball

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-2
01:29:01.264 --> 01:29:05.638
that went through the camper
window and out the other side

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-3
01:29:05.638 --> 01:29:10.530
because I see the person who got
hit. There's a camper with a red

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-4
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:15.275
and white awning set up again.
We have people gathered together

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-5
01:29:15.275 --> 01:29:19.500
in family packs. There's a
family with a dog and another

09b5a37d-b1b9-48ca-95ab-d61b6dcb49fe-6
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.279
family with maybe a cat.

f9b739a2-5812-47cd-a0fb-a6ed09dec662-0
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:27.009
Um, there's a family with a
grill cooking, and then beyond

f9b739a2-5812-47cd-a0fb-a6ed09dec662-1
01:29:27.009 --> 01:29:32.454
that is another path, and people
are walking and bicycling, and

f9b739a2-5812-47cd-a0fb-a6ed09dec662-2
01:29:32.454 --> 01:29:33.560
there's even.

20aa12e6-db1f-4d76-b6e7-a592ff28c4e1-0
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:37.410
It's not a unicycle, but it's
one of those strange things with

20aa12e6-db1f-4d76-b6e7-a592ff28c4e1-1
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:40.100
a really big front wheel and a
little tiny back wheel.

64d715f3-7e99-43ef-859d-0874222f821f-0
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:45.357
And then beyond
that, we have more just open

64d715f3-7e99-43ef-859d-0874222f821f-1
01:29:45.357 --> 01:29:45.660
land. #END_campsite 

dc255c9b-2342-4571-86f2-38129dbf5c82-0
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:54.995
There we go. So then the last
two items are both stories. One

dc255c9b-2342-4571-86f2-38129dbf5c82-1
01:29:54.995 --> 01:30:00.715
is 4 pages, the other is 2
pages. So it seems like we might

dc255c9b-2342-4571-86f2-38129dbf5c82-2
01:30:00.715 --> 01:30:05.100
go over 11:00 AM OK is that OK
with you? OK.

2ce2828d-616e-4c19-9c61-1afa166be81e-0
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.810
OK, so this yeah again.

b7dd848d-306f-4968-88cf-5ad58e627607-0
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.765
#START_arrival_5 Here we are
back to our story with the man

b7dd848d-306f-4968-88cf-5ad58e627607-1
01:30:18.765 --> 01:30:23.028
with the hat and the man with
the offices and the boy and the

b7dd848d-306f-4968-88cf-5ad58e627607-2
01:30:23.028 --> 01:30:27.223
strange city kind of carved
buildings carved out of rock and

b7dd848d-306f-4968-88cf-5ad58e627607-3
01:30:27.223 --> 01:30:29.630
a large large bird like
sculpture.

e281318c-beb2-4008-ac9d-f1783a097c69-0
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:37.069
Few of them powering over the
town and lots of birds flocking

e281318c-beb2-4008-ac9d-f1783a097c69-1
01:30:37.069 --> 01:30:38.540
in the sky and.

44cf6afd-a929-43b7-b116-1e1684e19111-0
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:45.721
There's a little boat with a few
people, three people I think

44cf6afd-a929-43b7-b116-1e1684e19111-1
01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:50.935
growing up to the ramp. That's
all one big picture. And then on

44cf6afd-a929-43b7-b116-1e1684e19111-2
01:30:50.935 --> 01:30:55.742
the next page are 12 little
pictures showing hands tying a

44cf6afd-a929-43b7-b116-1e1684e19111-3
01:30:55.742 --> 01:31:00.712
rope around. Oh, Fox designed
place to to more the boat. And

44cf6afd-a929-43b7-b116-1e1684e19111-4
01:31:00.712 --> 01:31:05.520
then the man with the glasses
and the man with the hat are

44cf6afd-a929-43b7-b116-1e1684e19111-5
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:10.490
standing and the man with the
glasses is gesturing. And now.

dae167e8-c529-4f7c-98b6-584c60da8c37-0
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.363
The little boy has gotten out of
the boat and is carrying a

dae167e8-c529-4f7c-98b6-584c60da8c37-1
01:31:14.363 --> 01:31:17.596
basket and the two little
creatures, the white dog

dae167e8-c529-4f7c-98b6-584c60da8c37-2
01:31:17.596 --> 01:31:21.336
creature and the dark fox
creature, leaping on either side

dae167e8-c529-4f7c-98b6-584c60da8c37-3
01:31:21.336 --> 01:31:24.633
of the boy approaching the
stairs, and then the boy

dae167e8-c529-4f7c-98b6-584c60da8c37-4
01:31:24.633 --> 01:31:28.500
approaches a woman and gives her
the basket with the fruits.

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-0
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:33.672
And then the man approaches the
woman and she puts her arm

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-1
01:31:33.672 --> 01:31:37.851
around him and they're
embracing. And then the man with

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-2
01:31:37.851 --> 01:31:42.403
the glasses introduces the man
with the hat. He's taking his

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-3
01:31:42.403 --> 01:31:47.029
hat off to greet the woman, who
is shaking his hand. And then

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-4
01:31:47.029 --> 01:31:51.656
the woman gestures, welcoming
him into the house. And then we

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-5
01:31:51.656 --> 01:31:56.208
have a close up of four hands
holding 4 glasses like they're

2ee82522-8709-4a77-9643-07fcf3f998d8-6
01:31:56.208 --> 01:31:58.820
clinking them together for
cheers.

8a61dc00-7077-461e-ad24-df1eda785795-0
01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:04.890
And then we have a picture of
the basket with some food items

8a61dc00-7077-461e-ad24-df1eda785795-1
01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:09.614
and a couple of hands handling
the food items. The next

8a61dc00-7077-461e-ad24-df1eda785795-2
01:32:09.614 --> 01:32:14.844
picture, a pair of hands and a
big cleaver, is slicing one of

8a61dc00-7077-461e-ad24-df1eda785795-3
01:32:14.844 --> 01:32:16.110
the food items.

2a5a531f-e789-461c-bab0-816e5e7a611a-0
01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:23.860
Spiky, cylindrical and kind of
get into circles.

1f24f1f0-a680-4ae3-a776-60dc4e2d2d9e-0
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.910
And the next picture is another
pair of hands.

4c192714-d55b-4be4-b70c-8854fd627c07-0
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:36.310
Doing something with another
food preparation item, I really

4c192714-d55b-4be4-b70c-8854fd627c07-1
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:38.100
can't tell what it is.

17ee1201-3955-486b-8933-edc018c3d200-0
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:44.701
And then the final picture on
this page, the hands are holding

17ee1201-3955-486b-8933-edc018c3d200-1
01:32:44.701 --> 01:32:49.783
a small measuring cup and a
brush, and perhaps there's

17ee1201-3955-486b-8933-edc018c3d200-2
01:32:49.783 --> 01:32:55.142
melted butter or something in
the cup, and it's a basting

17ee1201-3955-486b-8933-edc018c3d200-3
01:32:55.142 --> 01:33:00.594
brush that is brushing what
looks like the equivalent of a

17ee1201-3955-486b-8933-edc018c3d200-4
01:33:00.594 --> 01:33:02.349
chicken on a plate.

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-0
01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:10.765
The next page, there's a big
picture of all the people seated

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-1
01:33:10.765 --> 01:33:15.250
around the table. There's the
man with the glasses, and the

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-2
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:20.035
woman and the man with the hat.
He's not wearing his hat or his

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-3
01:33:20.035 --> 01:33:24.371
jacket anymore. And the boy and
he's reaching down to the

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-4
01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:28.632
animals with a little food in
his hand. And the man just

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-5
01:33:28.632 --> 01:33:32.969
standing up with perhaps a
crustacean food item in a pair

13aaa1c1-2bc2-4f7f-bba2-4976f201ed06-6
01:33:32.969 --> 01:33:34.240
of tongs holding.

2d0feb01-381b-4459-9e22-11b31824faac-0
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:35.930
A little blowtorch.

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-0
01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.431
Maybe that's how they cook it.
Yeah. And the table is covered

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-1
01:33:41.431 --> 01:33:45.782
with pots and dishes and food
items. And then we have another

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-2
01:33:45.782 --> 01:33:50.064
series of 12 pictures, close-ups
of the man with the glasses

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-3
01:33:50.064 --> 01:33:54.134
laughing and picture of the
woman laughing and the man of

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-4
01:33:54.134 --> 01:33:58.345
the hat without the hat on
laughing. Then we have a picture

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-5
01:33:58.345 --> 01:34:02.767
of the man with the glasses with
some kind of an accordion and

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-6
01:34:02.767 --> 01:34:07.188
strange horns coming out of it,
he is playing it, and then the

79a53678-23e0-4dcb-b861-9e18019d2055-7
01:34:07.188 --> 01:34:07.610
woman.

ba2a1fd6-e01b-4ab0-9d2a-a879cf051c18-0
01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.590
Just playing some kind of a
pipe.

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-0
01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:14.728
With a light at the end of it,
and the boy is playing a

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-1
01:34:14.728 --> 01:34:19.225
stringed instrument like a
banjo. And the man with the hat

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-2
01:34:19.225 --> 01:34:23.798
has taken a piece of paper and
is beginning to fold it like

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-3
01:34:23.798 --> 01:34:28.067
origami. And he's created an
origami fox like the boy's

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-4
01:34:28.067 --> 01:34:32.411
little creature. And he's given
it to the boy, who looks

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-5
01:34:32.411 --> 01:34:37.061
delighted and is wearing the
man's hat. And at the bottom we

21cf7a90-cb7c-4a2d-befa-911210b55d20-6
01:34:37.061 --> 01:34:40.110
have the man with the glasses
reaching.

d4ade1d8-3bb7-475c-a4c3-67e84e336763-0
01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:46.199
Into a container and opening a
door and taking a container out

d4ade1d8-3bb7-475c-a4c3-67e84e336763-1
01:34:46.199 --> 01:34:50.820
and then the man and the woman
are holding the container.

910c6381-3460-4816-86e9-2fdf329ffdcd-0
01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.656
A pot together, and then we have
a close up of the man's hands

910c6381-3460-4816-86e9-2fdf329ffdcd-1
01:34:56.656 --> 01:34:57.930
holding the pot.

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-0
01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:05.506
Next picture we have a close up
of the pot and it's mostly in

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-1
01:35:05.506 --> 01:35:10.042
shadow and then we back away and
we get a view of the bit of the

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-2
01:35:10.042 --> 01:35:14.159
table that the pot is on and
then it's not a table, it's a

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-3
01:35:14.159 --> 01:35:18.625
big window sill that the pot is
on and there's increasing light

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-4
01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:22.952
in the picture. And then we have
3 little pictures of the man

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-5
01:35:22.952 --> 01:35:27.418
waking up from bed, rubbing his
eyes, sitting up, being greeted

7ea8508e-1973-4434-bc0a-834984019e87-6
01:35:27.418 --> 01:35:30.070
by his creature patting his
creature.

d89313b2-d7cb-4035-885f-0811e026111c-0
01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:34.690
And then we have the man
buttoning his shirt, and someone

d89313b2-d7cb-4035-885f-0811e026111c-1
01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:38.670
is cutting up one of the
strawberry fruits and feeding a

d89313b2-d7cb-4035-885f-0811e026111c-2
01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:43.000
slice of it to the white dog
creature, and the man putting on

d89313b2-d7cb-4035-885f-0811e026111c-3
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.469
his jacket and looking for his
hat, and the little dog creature

d89313b2-d7cb-4035-885f-0811e026111c-4
01:35:47.469 --> 01:35:51.380
is holding the hat and offering
it to him in his mouth.

77b165fa-7a96-494a-8b28-04f9f31cbe60-0
01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:57.148
The next page we have a street
scene with lots of people

77b165fa-7a96-494a-8b28-04f9f31cbe60-1
01:35:57.148 --> 01:36:01.715
walking, holding bags, standing
and creatures walking and

77b165fa-7a96-494a-8b28-04f9f31cbe60-2
01:36:01.715 --> 01:36:06.361
flying. There's a picture of a
few men pulling, looks like

77b165fa-7a96-494a-8b28-04f9f31cbe60-3
01:36:06.361 --> 01:36:11.480
they're pulling a rope, and then
there's a picture of a man with

77b165fa-7a96-494a-8b28-04f9f31cbe60-4
01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.205
a big basket and little fishes
reaching up. I'm not sure if

77b165fa-7a96-494a-8b28-04f9f31cbe60-5
01:36:16.205 --> 01:36:19.040
he's feeding them or catching
them.

505f32ef-38f6-4385-8ea2-774d2ef2ad99-0
01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.980
And then the next picture is
some people with different hats

505f32ef-38f6-4385-8ea2-774d2ef2ad99-1
01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:30.265
on, maybe exchanging money, and
there's a picture of a man at

505f32ef-38f6-4385-8ea2-774d2ef2ad99-2
01:36:30.265 --> 01:36:33.589
some kind of a wheel decorative
wheel.

0b251cae-2999-46c9-94cc-593787f59ccd-0
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.920
Another person on a ladder
painting and another person.

26de830b-19e0-4e9a-a12c-55b4501e18a7-0
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:44.179
With a little cart making
things. And then we've got a few

26de830b-19e0-4e9a-a12c-55b4501e18a7-1
01:36:44.179 --> 01:36:48.971
more pictures. Our man with the
hat holding his hat in his hand,

26de830b-19e0-4e9a-a12c-55b4501e18a7-2
01:36:48.971 --> 01:36:53.099
talking to a man, perhaps a
Baker. He's wearing a white

26de830b-19e0-4e9a-a12c-55b4501e18a7-3
01:36:53.099 --> 01:36:57.080
apron and has a big bowl and
some spoons in a pocket.

d267736a-ab00-46ca-a089-e717e5f43d10-0
01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:00.260
Talking at the door and
gesturing.

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-0
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:06.617
But it looks like the the Baker
is holding up his hand, saying

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-1
01:37:06.617 --> 01:37:11.309
no. And then the man in the next
picture is talking to a man who

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-2
01:37:11.309 --> 01:37:15.928
appears to be fixing some kind
of machinery. And the man fixing

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-3
01:37:15.928 --> 01:37:20.692
the machinery is also holding up
his hand, saying no. And the man

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-4
01:37:20.692 --> 01:37:25.240
is now in a shop talking to the
shopkeeper, and she is holding

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-5
01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.787
up her hand saying no. And now
the man is outside, standing in

c53b39a8-81f2-4ead-b8eb-851ff48c3786-6
01:37:29.787 --> 01:37:31.520
the midst of all of the.

7772a354-75eb-43c2-920c-6cfb54ac483b-0
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:32.910
Airships.

45229e7c-af47-4b3d-9664-e8d3af6b95d3-0
01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:38.667
Um, and he's
talking to a man. And that man

45229e7c-af47-4b3d-9664-e8d3af6b95d3-1
01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:43.762
is holding up his hand, perhaps
also saying no. And there are

45229e7c-af47-4b3d-9664-e8d3af6b95d3-2
01:37:43.762 --> 01:37:48.610
lots of workers, you know,
grooming and carrying things in

45229e7c-af47-4b3d-9664-e8d3af6b95d3-3
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:53.704
that picture. #END_arrival_5  All right. OK, so
that was 10 minutes, and now

45229e7c-af47-4b3d-9664-e8d3af6b95d3-4
01:37:53.704 --> 01:37:57.320
we're at the last item. It's
also a story.

3da30bdc-f41c-4ba6-9cb4-0318d9f5eeee-0
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:59.560
Go ahead.

90f0a017-9646-4029-b985-8db789ab93dc-0
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:04.620
Show my pictures pages 2 pages,
OK.

3d2b3a2f-acda-46be-9189-fa5a52b93998-0
01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:07.670
#START_arrival_3 So here we
have.

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-0
01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:13.243
Ohh picture of a like a
newspaper boy standing on the

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-1
01:38:13.243 --> 01:38:17.850
street corner holding a sign
with writing on it and rolled up

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-2
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:22.310
papers under his arm and some
other adults milling about on

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-3
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:26.694
the street. And then we have a
close up of a woman with it

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-4
01:38:26.694 --> 01:38:30.782
looks like a hairless cat
standing on her arm or being

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-5
01:38:30.782 --> 01:38:35.241
held in her arms. And then
there's a close up of a man with

0f401030-e9c8-43d2-9576-bd2e81a97931-6
01:38:35.241 --> 01:38:35.390
a.

35fda976-88f7-4dd3-8b1a-4ddd7d50ab5e-0
01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.520
Strange cart.

b34c67e7-dac9-4a05-9f25-28cb4769c4a2-0
01:38:38.210 --> 01:38:42.283
Maybe he's making coffee or some
kind of food and there's a

b34c67e7-dac9-4a05-9f25-28cb4769c4a2-1
01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:46.357
creature and a basket peering
out, and then there's another

b34c67e7-dac9-4a05-9f25-28cb4769c4a2-2
01:38:46.357 --> 01:38:47.240
picture of a.

b2dbe8db-98ca-47dc-afbc-2543afc7ca06-0
01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.372
Fox with very large eggs in it,
and a man and a woman standing

b2dbe8db-98ca-47dc-afbc-2543afc7ca06-1
01:38:52.372 --> 01:38:53.150
next to it.

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-0
01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.824
Each holding an egg, and it
takes two hands to pick up and

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-1
01:38:58.824 --> 01:39:03.420
hold these eggs. And then we've
got four more little pictures.

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-2
01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:07.943
There's a picture of a Barber
giving a man sitting in a chair

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-3
01:39:07.943 --> 01:39:12.612
a shave and a boy standing next
to the man getting a shave. And

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-4
01:39:12.612 --> 01:39:16.771
then there we're on a street
corner with two men playing

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-5
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:20.492
musical instruments and
accordion type thing and a

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-6
01:39:20.492 --> 01:39:24.796
violin and lots of birds on the
ground. And then there's a

2b6de69c-0b9d-4398-98a6-a8e332b8f01f-7
01:39:24.796 --> 01:39:25.380
picture.

3ff5b8f4-e54b-493b-84ed-78b6a9723336-0
01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.091
Of people sitting on chairs or
benches like they're waiting in

3ff5b8f4-e54b-493b-84ed-78b6a9723336-1
01:39:31.091 --> 01:39:35.789
a shop or something. They're
women sitting and one has a big

3ff5b8f4-e54b-493b-84ed-78b6a9723336-2
01:39:35.789 --> 01:39:40.794
book open on her lap and another
one looks like she's sewing and

3ff5b8f4-e54b-493b-84ed-78b6a9723336-3
01:39:40.794 --> 01:39:43.490
another one is holding a
creature.

f8a031ab-6371-4a99-9304-7f089785d40b-0
01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:49.392
And then the last picture on
these pages is our man with the

f8a031ab-6371-4a99-9304-7f089785d40b-1
01:39:49.392 --> 01:39:54.392
hat standing there with his hand
on his chin, looking around and

f8a031ab-6371-4a99-9304-7f089785d40b-2
01:39:54.392 --> 01:39:57.470
holding his suitcase in the
other hand.

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-0
01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:07.014
And on the next spread of pages,
or lots of little pictures, the

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-1
01:40:07.014 --> 01:40:11.263
man has pulled out of pocket
watch and opened it. And he

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-2
01:40:11.263 --> 01:40:15.884
looks at it. And then he looks
up and he looks at a big clock

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-3
01:40:15.884 --> 01:40:20.132
tower and his face looks
concerned. And now he's walking

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-4
01:40:20.132 --> 01:40:24.455
across a street holding his
suitcase, and he's continuing

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-5
01:40:24.455 --> 01:40:28.927
down a street and past a store
window. And now he's walking

6dfb5d44-0b7c-4e85-a1da-6ef208ba64db-6
01:40:28.927 --> 01:40:29.300
down.

c9155d55-7428-4ef0-afda-2727daaec691-0
01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.436
And there were people in a
couple of those pictures and now

c9155d55-7428-4ef0-afda-2727daaec691-1
01:40:32.436 --> 01:40:33.570
he's on an empty Street

24652e31-9913-490c-aedc-a7e5e5689443-0
01:40:35.170 --> 01:40:39.515
And there are little lights, and
I don't know if it's becoming

24652e31-9913-490c-aedc-a7e5e5689443-1
01:40:39.515 --> 01:40:43.515
night time and if these are
fireflies or glowing bubbles,

24652e31-9913-490c-aedc-a7e5e5689443-2
01:40:43.515 --> 01:40:47.654
but now he's standing there
looking around him and surprise

24652e31-9913-490c-aedc-a7e5e5689443-3
01:40:47.654 --> 01:40:47.930
and.

b9f29fdb-ca96-4efd-8c35-1c7b91a453ba-0
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:52.367
Quizzically looking at these
glowing bubbles. And then

b9f29fdb-ca96-4efd-8c35-1c7b91a453ba-1
01:40:52.367 --> 01:40:53.650
there's a wind that.

12da17e0-3918-47fe-898f-44bb9176d63a-0
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:57.560
Comes up and blows his hat off
his head.

20e7ed99-1abc-4ff9-a8e2-58bf9f879b9d-0
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:02.984
In the next picture, he's
reaching down to pick up his hat

20e7ed99-1abc-4ff9-a8e2-58bf9f879b9d-1
01:41:02.984 --> 01:41:07.030
from the ground, and there are
some drawings and letters.

f18f29bd-9dce-4d2d-b0a5-01559e619fa3-0
01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:10.982
And as he's putting his hat back
on his head, he's looking down

f18f29bd-9dce-4d2d-b0a5-01559e619fa3-1
01:41:10.982 --> 01:41:11.700
and regarding.

a960aabf-498a-4d3b-b2da-9c9fba2137bd-0
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:13.800
The arrows and.

07e2e075-254c-4378-bc77-cb949c3d0de7-0
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:15.920
Letters.

76662628-d235-42b8-b509-0f797d351767-0
01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.882
Then he's sitting on the ground
with his book Open and his

76662628-d235-42b8-b509-0f797d351767-1
01:41:20.882 --> 01:41:22.200
suitcase next to him.

c4b85046-979f-4d0f-95c0-b77033cdee9b-0
01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.150
And he's.

c97d56a1-a1fb-4e83-8987-21675a1d84c7-0
01:41:24.810 --> 01:41:26.970
There are. There is writing in
the book.

729b958c-2ed4-4df0-a991-9a562825cd15-0
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:32.442
And then a hand from one side is
reaching out to tap him on the

729b958c-2ed4-4df0-a991-9a562825cd15-1
01:41:32.442 --> 01:41:36.985
shoulder and he's looking up and
there's a dark skinned man with

729b958c-2ed4-4df0-a991-9a562825cd15-2
01:41:36.985 --> 01:41:40.340
a turban on his head with his
hand reached out.

91f32241-8d23-4eb6-beaa-6b065ab9b237-0
01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.143
And now the man with the hat is
standing up, talking to the man

91f32241-8d23-4eb6-beaa-6b065ab9b237-1
01:41:46.143 --> 01:41:48.400
with the turban and their
gesturing.

6b41902d-2f2d-4333-ad29-fbab3453b047-0
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.953
And then the man takes out his
book and draws a picture for the

6b41902d-2f2d-4333-ad29-fbab3453b047-1
01:41:53.953 --> 01:41:58.107
man with the turban to look at.
And there's a picture of a bed.

6b41902d-2f2d-4333-ad29-fbab3453b047-2
01:41:58.107 --> 01:42:02.260
And the man with the turban has
an expression of understanding,

6b41902d-2f2d-4333-ad29-fbab3453b047-3
01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:06.219
like ah and his hand holding up
one finger. And then the man

6b41902d-2f2d-4333-ad29-fbab3453b047-4
01:42:06.219 --> 01:42:09.270
with the turban is gesturing in
one direction.

6a78eafd-71c2-412b-b660-da5babcbb9dd-0
01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.607
And then the man
with the turban, we see him

6a78eafd-71c2-412b-b660-da5babcbb9dd-1
01:42:13.607 --> 01:42:16.996
walking with a basket on his
back with a creature in the

6a78eafd-71c2-412b-b660-da5babcbb9dd-2
01:42:16.996 --> 01:42:20.742
basket, and the man with the hat
and the suitcase is following

6a78eafd-71c2-412b-b660-da5babcbb9dd-3
01:42:20.742 --> 01:42:22.170
the man with the turban. #END_arrival_3

We are.

26270b8d-adc1-4edf-9d5a-d5fe4206e201-0
