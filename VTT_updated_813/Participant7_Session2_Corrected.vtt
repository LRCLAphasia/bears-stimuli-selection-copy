00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.590
As a reminder, there will be two
types of visuals that you see.

e1821868-414d-4584-81d9-952be94d34c6-1
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.231
One is a complex scene and the
other is wordless picture book.

e1821868-414d-4584-81d9-952be94d34c6-2
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:21.051
OK, and this item is a story of
wordless picture book. So please

e1821868-414d-4584-81d9-952be94d34c6-3
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:26.513
describe what you see and what
is happening as thoroughly as

e1821868-414d-4584-81d9-952be94d34c6-4
00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:32.334
you can and take around 10 to 15
minutes, but I'll be looking at

e1821868-414d-4584-81d9-952be94d34c6-5
00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:33.140
the time.

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-0
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.972
To go, OK, where you ready? You
can start. Sounds good. {FULL

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-1
00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:42.572
CHAPTER 4 So this story begins
with the image of a pot that

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-2
00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:46.635
looks like it's made of
terracotta. And as it slowly

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-3
00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:51.541
zooms out, the pot gets a little
smaller and it looks like it's

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-4
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:56.370
on the outer side of a window
sill. And as we come to the next

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-5
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.430
scene, we see a gentleman in bed
waking up. He's rubbing his eyes

aded154b-99f6-4fe2-b7f2-6209d92e7500-6
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.190
to the dim sunlight as he wakes
up.

abf4582e-4f1a-4877-922d-b6bcd036db57-0
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.753
And his small little creature
that looks like the mixture of

abf4582e-4f1a-4877-922d-b6bcd036db57-1
00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:13.520
an axolotl and a rat, but about
the size of a cat, hops onto his

abf4582e-4f1a-4877-922d-b6bcd036db57-2
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.360
lap and he looks down at it. And
then he begins to rub his little

abf4582e-4f1a-4877-922d-b6bcd036db57-3
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.833
bald head and he gets up and he
starts to get dressed. So he

abf4582e-4f1a-4877-922d-b6bcd036db57-4
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:26.060
buttons up his white collared
button shirt.

93a6fee6-888b-4256-a38e-b402e269b823-0
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.947
And he begins to prepare himself
some food, so he's chopping what

93a6fee6-888b-4256-a38e-b402e269b823-1
00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:37.910
looks like to be some sort of
pepper dragon fruit hybrid.

aab7e294-58e3-43fd-b31c-8d09ccc982ed-0
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.949
But with a knife and a little
piece of parchment it looks like

aab7e294-58e3-43fd-b31c-8d09ccc982ed-1
00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:49.896
and he's sitting at a counter
and he has his food on a plate

aab7e294-58e3-43fd-b31c-8d09ccc982ed-2
00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:54.843
on the corner of the counter
with the knife on the edge {and

aab7e294-58e3-43fd-b31c-8d09ccc982ed-3
00:01:54.843 --> 00:02:00.195
sorry my cat}. And he then gives
a small piece to his little pet.

aab7e294-58e3-43fd-b31c-8d09ccc982ed-4
00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:05.224
He then gets himself ready for
the rest of the day so he puts

aab7e294-58e3-43fd-b31c-8d09ccc982ed-5
00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:10.089
on a dark colored vest and a
dark suit coat and his little.

a7e7adfa-bbe8-4e28-9cab-3162e36704ed-0
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.880
axolotl cat friend gives him
his.

8a643ca6-e2e1-402e-b109-dfea4d4552b6-0
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.333
Kind of 1950s gangster hat. I
don't know what those hats are

8a643ca6-e2e1-402e-b109-dfea4d4552b6-1
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:25.106
called, but 1950s gangster hat,
which matches his suit coat,

8a643ca6-e2e1-402e-b109-dfea4d4552b6-2
00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:25.420
yes.

0536bc92-2981-45ec-b009-dee4a56be766-0
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.050
So now he enters what looks like
kind of.

173aa724-8b3c-4c21-b24e-2a8a6d8a1f89-0
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.897
The busy section of like a
midtown or at downtown, there

173aa724-8b3c-4c21-b24e-2a8a6d8a1f89-1
00:02:35.897 --> 00:02:40.036
are banners in the sky. It's
kind of a hazy image, just kind

173aa724-8b3c-4c21-b24e-2a8a6d8a1f89-2
00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:43.428
of giving you the setting.
There's people walking

173aa724-8b3c-4c21-b24e-2a8a6d8a1f89-3
00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.600
everywhere in different clothes.

08b028cb-d0d8-4065-8a1e-e226c9edd7bf-0
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.311
They are silhouetted and you see
that a lot of these people have

08b028cb-d0d8-4065-8a1e-e226c9edd7bf-1
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:55.354
companions with them similar to
the companion that he does. So

08b028cb-d0d8-4065-8a1e-e226c9edd7bf-2
00:02:55.354 --> 00:02:59.590
one man looks like he's got what
looks like a duck, the other has

08b028cb-d0d8-4065-8a1e-e226c9edd7bf-3
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.762
a little bird like creature, and
there are some flying creatures

08b028cb-d0d8-4065-8a1e-e226c9edd7bf-4
00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:06.650
that look like large dragonflies
in the sky.

7976f427-0cba-4a89-9eae-becdb0cd106f-0
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.114
And after he makes his way
through the square as he

7976f427-0cba-4a89-9eae-becdb0cd106f-1
00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:13.580
continues to walk.

b47d5997-8a02-4564-9842-408b01423b5c-0
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.635
There look to be men working on
something and some sort of

b47d5997-8a02-4564-9842-408b01423b5c-1
00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:23.870
factory. There's kind of tall
buildings. They almost look like

b47d5997-8a02-4564-9842-408b01423b5c-2
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.038
reactors from a nuclear power
plant. We see another man who's

b47d5997-8a02-4564-9842-408b01423b5c-3
00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:29.450
feeding some sort of.

17ad4f94-246f-40da-b2e6-127f33d3fd73-0
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.940
Um, like fish or animals out of
a Wicker basket while wearing a.

44c15afa-ebb3-4dd2-8e5b-fd324e58d2f8-0
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.300
Like a straw hat.

20886e1c-92a9-4eb4-a700-67f304dab2f0-0
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.690
We see another person selling
goods over a counter to a woman.

5ccf8950-efe6-468c-9a6b-9f63741beb10-0
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.102
We see someone who looks like
they're making tapestries or

5ccf8950-efe6-468c-9a6b-9f63741beb10-1
00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:53.310
some sort of pottery. It's kind
of hard to tell.

470d6187-8c7e-49c5-9022-871f2c46796f-0
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.243
And then we see a gentleman up
on a high ladder who is painting

470d6187-8c7e-49c5-9022-871f2c46796f-1
00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:03.080
the side of the building, and we
see a woman who is.

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-0
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.400
Doing something on the top of
kind of like a four wheeled

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-1
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.864
wagon that has a box out of it.
So we kind of come back to our

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-2
00:04:13.864 --> 00:04:18.116
main character, the man who is
dressed in some dark clothes

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-3
00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:22.227
with his little friend, and he
approaches a person in the

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-4
00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:26.691
doorway who looks like a chef.
He's wearing a white apron that

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-5
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:30.943
has some tool sticking out of
it. He's got a bowl under his

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-6
00:04:30.943 --> 00:04:35.266
right arm with a spatula in it,
and he's got a pointy little

52788556-bc67-4a20-b6c5-bee9f4928d65-7
00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:35.549
hat.

c37d4dcd-7ddd-418e-b7a2-ef20516cfc5f-0
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.150
Uh.

fe3f807c-c06b-4acb-a179-9cccffc2d50c-0
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.983
He then continues on, so it
seems like he's working his way

fe3f807c-c06b-4acb-a179-9cccffc2d50c-1
00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:43.420
through the town getting his
morning chores done.

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-0
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.770
So we assume that he left.
Seeing that chef, he moves on to

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-1
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.091
his next stop, which is looks
like a man who operates a

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-2
00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:58.030
boiler, and the boiler man has
his own little pet. It's kind of

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-3
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.660
like a little crocodile who's
holding a wrench in his mouth

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-4
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.209
and they're having a
conversation. The boiler

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-5
00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:11.071
operator wears glasses and kind
of like a Peaky Blinders style

e0e9dda3-767e-4300-8fc9-7ee0e9cf66c8-6
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:11.380
hat.

b49ac283-c4af-4346-a7d7-8e13953052f2-0
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.282
He moves on to see what looks
almost like an apothecary of

b49ac283-c4af-4346-a7d7-8e13953052f2-1
00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:18.100
some sorts.

b6cf6006-719d-4bcd-b771-eff938921f5e-0
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.230
Uh, got a lot of products on the
shelf.

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-0
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.108
Behind this woman who's kind of
dressed in a little bit of a

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-1
00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:29.979
black coat cloak. She's got dark
hair and it's hard to tell if

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-2
00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.604
they're having a a decent
conversation or if there's maybe

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-3
00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:37.598
a little bit of an argument just
because the woman has her hands

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-4
00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:41.469
up, maybe in a defensive manner.
Or maybe she's just trying to

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-5
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.094
explain something and her face
doesn't look angry. It just

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-6
00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:48.781
looks like maybe there was a
misunderstanding in the in the

9f9c14cc-e426-4605-a81d-a489d152bbd1-7
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.579
conversation.

38655aaf-8d3a-4c06-84e7-42b93df5062f-0
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.326
And there's little bowls in this
apothecary on the counter that

38655aaf-8d3a-4c06-84e7-42b93df5062f-1
00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:59.392
all have these small little
black creatures kind of peering

38655aaf-8d3a-4c06-84e7-42b93df5062f-2
00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:03.594
out of them. And we don't know
if they're alive or if they're

38655aaf-8d3a-4c06-84e7-42b93df5062f-3
00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:07.998
dead, but they are just kind of
looking out at the man. And then

38655aaf-8d3a-4c06-84e7-42b93df5062f-4
00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:12.200
he continues, on his day, he
gets to be underneath what looks

38655aaf-8d3a-4c06-84e7-42b93df5062f-5
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.419
like a large ship.

715f9cab-98b6-4fa4-893b-30299373bde0-0
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.945
It's got a massive propeller
that's suspended in the air and

715f9cab-98b6-4fa4-893b-30299373bde0-1
00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:22.750
there are people working on
their ship you can see like

715f9cab-98b6-4fa4-893b-30299373bde0-2
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.759
ropes and cables dangling from
it, men working underneath,

715f9cab-98b6-4fa4-893b-30299373bde0-3
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.409
sweeping, carrying different
supplies.

1293206b-ae88-4424-a908-bf2df519884e-0
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.086
And it looks like there are
other ships like these in the

1293206b-ae88-4424-a908-bf2df519884e-1
00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:36.002
background, so we assume that
these are kind of their main

1293206b-ae88-4424-a908-bf2df519884e-2
00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:37.930
source of transportation in this
area.

9d5ae6b8-3276-45f0-a586-3880617f7601-0
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.258
So now that the man kind of got
all of his morning errands and

9d5ae6b8-3276-45f0-a586-3880617f7601-1
00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:50.562
talking to the different
villagers he was seeing, he

9d5ae6b8-3276-45f0-a586-3880617f7601-2
00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:54.304
takes a break on the side of the
building on a small wooden

9d5ae6b8-3276-45f0-a586-3880617f7601-3
00:06:54.304 --> 00:06:58.232
bench. He sits down, takes off
his hat and wipes his forehead.

9d5ae6b8-3276-45f0-a586-3880617f7601-4
00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:02.285
He looks over to his little pet
and his pet kind of scurries off

9d5ae6b8-3276-45f0-a586-3880617f7601-5
00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:03.470
and he's like, hey.

196cea80-bc1f-4528-9a45-9ed382c2cecf-0
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.951
Where you going? So he gets up
and he kind of follows him and

196cea80-bc1f-4528-9a45-9ed382c2cecf-1
00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:11.668
the pet leads him to this man
who is putting up a poster on

196cea80-bc1f-4528-9a45-9ed382c2cecf-2
00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:12.970
the side of the wall.

33abffcf-8da9-4a6a-9d45-1eda5c94e1ac-0
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.413
Our main character approaches
the man who's putting up the

33abffcf-8da9-4a6a-9d45-1eda5c94e1ac-1
00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:19.250
poster and taps him on the
shoulder and.

df58682d-487f-4ffd-97fb-4f7e8ea56a15-0
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.785
Ask them a question. Looks like
he asked, you know, what is this

df58682d-487f-4ffd-97fb-4f7e8ea56a15-1
00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:27.425
all about? What does it mean?
And the man who's putting up the

df58682d-487f-4ffd-97fb-4f7e8ea56a15-2
00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:30.950
poster pauses for a minute.
That's his hand on his chin. And

df58682d-487f-4ffd-97fb-4f7e8ea56a15-3
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.030
then he goes on to kind of
explain.

49f7c012-2ef0-49b4-a2c8-942530876e53-0
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.272
Hard to tell how much the man
knows about what the posters

49f7c012-2ef0-49b4-a2c8-942530876e53-1
00:07:37.272 --> 00:07:40.572
he's putting up about, but he
does give a quick explanation.

49f7c012-2ef0-49b4-a2c8-942530876e53-2
00:07:40.572 --> 00:07:44.035
It looks like they came to some
sort of agreement as they shake

49f7c012-2ef0-49b4-a2c8-942530876e53-3
00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:44.360
hands.

68eec393-bcde-4dc3-abf0-45f1f3e3beb2-0
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.750
And it looks like now.

829756c2-22fc-4758-a959-386686645dd2-0
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.248
Our character is helping to put
up these posters so it looks

829756c2-22fc-4758-a959-386686645dd2-1
00:07:51.248 --> 00:07:52.500
like they made a deal.

b2d23347-deea-49d6-acc4-efcd77da42c5-0
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.292
So he walks off, he takes sorry,
I was just trying to figure out

b2d23347-deea-49d6-acc4-efcd77da42c5-1
00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:05.370
what I was looking at. He takes
off his suit coat and he starts

b2d23347-deea-49d6-acc4-efcd77da42c5-2
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.258
dipping a paintbrush into a
paint bucket, which we assume is

b2d23347-deea-49d6-acc4-efcd77da42c5-3
00:08:09.258 --> 00:08:11.680
glue, and he starts to plaster
these.

ee5c84de-f925-4f94-afdf-01dd430537ad-0
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.552
Pictures up on the wall and his
little friend is helping by

ee5c84de-f925-4f94-afdf-01dd430537ad-1
00:08:15.552 --> 00:08:18.851
holding him in his mouth and he
goes around the city and it's

ee5c84de-f925-4f94-afdf-01dd430537ad-2
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:19.650
putting him up.

e2d467f6-5d29-4dde-bd83-674a31a054fa-0
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.260
Looks like the same gentleman
from earlier who had originally

e2d467f6-5d29-4dde-bd83-674a31a054fa-1
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.787
given in the poster approaches
him and kind of talks him about

e2d467f6-5d29-4dde-bd83-674a31a054fa-2
00:08:28.787 --> 00:08:32.369
the painting again and we see or
the poster and we see that the

e2d467f6-5d29-4dde-bd83-674a31a054fa-3
00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:35.728
posters of some sort of symbol,
but we don't know what this

e2d467f6-5d29-4dde-bd83-674a31a054fa-4
00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:36.679
symbol means, so.

5a1863fa-3c3a-4714-832d-f1a1f99d1403-0
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.060
My dog apparently needs to be on
my lap.

a4c087dd-c785-48cb-9fc0-103f77527195-0
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.313
Alright, so we're continuing on,
looks like the man is done

a4c087dd-c785-48cb-9fc0-103f77527195-1
00:08:49.313 --> 00:08:52.837
putting up posters and he's
continuing through the market.

a4c087dd-c785-48cb-9fc0-103f77527195-2
00:08:52.837 --> 00:08:54.449
He gets to what looks like.

aa8e893e-1c44-4c3f-831d-450409f496a7-0
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.900
I don't know. Maybe like a
roaster or like cheeses?

aa453261-845a-4362-b46b-e12e659312f7-0
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.928
Um, this woman is giving large
baskets of goods to gentlemen,

aa453261-845a-4362-b46b-e12e659312f7-1
00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:10.114
and he goes up to her and starts
talking to her, and she shows

aa453261-845a-4362-b46b-e12e659312f7-2
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:10.379
him.

f92b5247-d30d-423b-92a0-44698a71a1e4-0
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.085
One of the items, they're
looking at it and then she shows

f92b5247-d30d-423b-92a0-44698a71a1e4-1
00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:19.480
him a map and she starts
pointing on the map as OK Ali.

f3541ff2-6d50-4a83-a838-ff8091df131f-0
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.810
On the map.

44ea4146-5bbf-4b03-bf45-d8b344125a17-0
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.664
And she shows him the number 7
on her fingers. And we don't

44ea4146-5bbf-4b03-bf45-d8b344125a17-1
00:09:26.664 --> 00:09:30.057
really know what this means yet,
but they shake hands so they

44ea4146-5bbf-4b03-bf45-d8b344125a17-2
00:09:30.057 --> 00:09:33.287
appear to have come to an
agreement, or he's thanking her.

44ea4146-5bbf-4b03-bf45-d8b344125a17-3
00:09:33.287 --> 00:09:36.845
And as he leaves with his basket
of goods that she gave him, she

44ea4146-5bbf-4b03-bf45-d8b344125a17-4
00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:39.691
points him in the right
direction. And so now he is

44ea4146-5bbf-4b03-bf45-d8b344125a17-5
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:42.100
walking down the street holding
the basket.

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-0
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.665
And carrying the map in one
hand. And he's also looking at

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-1
00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:50.485
the different items that he gave
her and he comes to a wall

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-2
00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:54.304
that's kind of plastered with
all different sorts of images

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-3
00:09:54.304 --> 00:09:57.933
and posters and things. It
almost reminds me of what you

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-4
00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:01.625
see when there's like a a
natural disaster and people are

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-5
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:05.827
looking for missing people. It's
kind of that many posters all in

a8131b45-e3af-4352-9766-27da27123a37-6
00:10:05.827 --> 00:10:06.400
one area.

3c4a8b35-9563-462a-929c-16da8b8a4e7a-0
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.493
So then he comes to something
different and I'm not sure if

3c4a8b35-9563-462a-929c-16da8b8a4e7a-1
00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:17.553
this is the present or if this
is the past because the color of

3c4a8b35-9563-462a-929c-16da8b8a4e7a-2
00:10:17.553 --> 00:10:22.455
the image turned from a sepia
tone to more of a grayscale. So

3c4a8b35-9563-462a-929c-16da8b8a4e7a-3
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:27.277
I think that has some sort of
significance to the story. But

3c4a8b35-9563-462a-929c-16da8b8a4e7a-4
00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:32.495
we see the a gentleman, we don't
know who the head, we cannot see

3c4a8b35-9563-462a-929c-16da8b8a4e7a-5
00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:37.159
at a counter with what looks
like salt and pepper shakers.

5e55e2a6-49f1-47cb-a74b-6819197026e8-0
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.450
Filled with salt, mostly. Don't
see Pepper, but he's picking

5e55e2a6-49f1-47cb-a74b-6819197026e8-1
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.310
them up and putting them inside
a little metal funnel.

7e20df6f-6bb9-4f8e-931e-1a80bb446276-0
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.350
Um.

827c8e32-1f5e-42f2-b2a7-e193df2e2cde-0
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.384
And more of them keep appearing.
So it almost seems like it's a

827c8e32-1f5e-42f2-b2a7-e193df2e2cde-1
00:10:54.384 --> 00:10:58.324
conveyor belt of sorts. So
that's where the story headed

827c8e32-1f5e-42f2-b2a7-e193df2e2cde-2
00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:58.670
next.

ece9294a-c525-4cd2-baf9-f2042245390b-0
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.061
And now we're back in the sepia
tone and we're back to the

ece9294a-c525-4cd2-baf9-f2042245390b-1
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:09.390
gentleman. And he has.

b5f378dd-2526-4263-b251-e66c6d9371ba-0
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.235
Um, boxes of things. And he's at
a wall that has images on it,

b5f378dd-2526-4263-b251-e66c6d9371ba-1
00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:16.170
but there's also holes in the
wall.

fcc00ebc-7c2b-43f8-8b89-a12cf29125b5-0
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.261
Almost like bricks are pulled
out and so you can put something

fcc00ebc-7c2b-43f8-8b89-a12cf29125b5-1
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:21.740
inside.

a5a130f7-6440-42ca-b196-22559086dc71-0
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.110
But there's a little sliding
door.

a1e36a05-333d-4b8a-b8a8-511258627768-0
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.219
That some of these holes. And so
he opens one of the sliding

a1e36a05-333d-4b8a-b8a8-511258627768-1
00:11:30.219 --> 00:11:34.457
doors and puts what looks like,
like a Chinese takeout box with

a1e36a05-333d-4b8a-b8a8-511258627768-2
00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:38.628
a symbol on the side inside of
one of these sliding doors. And

a1e36a05-333d-4b8a-b8a8-511258627768-3
00:11:38.628 --> 00:11:42.734
he does the same with another
box that's a little higher. And

a1e36a05-333d-4b8a-b8a8-511258627768-4
00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:46.971
then he carries on his way and
he exits through a gate that has

a1e36a05-333d-4b8a-b8a8-511258627768-5
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:48.229
some writing on it.

ba9ff5e1-b6f8-443c-bfb8-efb242fde9bf-0
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.530
And he leaves with his little
pet and then all of a sudden a

ba9ff5e1-b6f8-443c-bfb8-efb242fde9bf-1
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:55.020
large.

638c11f9-4a16-45e6-824b-5d8a864bcffc-0
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.746
Bird slash lizard like creature
kind of comes out of nowhere and

638c11f9-4a16-45e6-824b-5d8a864bcffc-1
00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:02.750
the man drops his basket of
things.

043ef368-6ffc-4de2-9bbf-9a0169b70b47-0
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.180
And the lizard is that.

5925f09a-3f8f-4677-a349-a8c36cd6d69c-0
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.618
The opening of the gate that he
had just exited from, and the

5925f09a-3f8f-4677-a349-a8c36cd6d69c-1
00:12:10.618 --> 00:12:15.366
man and his pet are running away
from it and now we are back in

5925f09a-3f8f-4677-a349-a8c36cd6d69c-2
00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:20.261
the grayscale and it is indeed a
factory. You see large gears and

5925f09a-3f8f-4677-a349-a8c36cd6d69c-3
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:24.860
you just see rows upon rows of
people kind of packed in there

5925f09a-3f8f-4677-a349-a8c36cd6d69c-4
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.756
tightly, all working on the same
well, looks like salt and pepper

5925f09a-3f8f-4677-a349-a8c36cd6d69c-5
00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:30.349
shakers.

ce5b6697-c433-42a3-875a-3f13413560f2-0
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:38.480
So yeah, doesn't look like the
best working situation.

cc465994-f1e6-46de-832e-b3c5142e07ba-0
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.153
And then we are now at a scene,
still in the grayscale, of a

cc465994-f1e6-46de-832e-b3c5142e07ba-1
00:12:44.153 --> 00:12:48.776
person's hand holding a cup, and
we see another hand reaching out

cc465994-f1e6-46de-832e-b3c5142e07ba-2
00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:52.700
to grab it, and we see someone
pouring a liquid out of.

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-0
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.361
A beaker? No, it's a flask. I
don't remember my chemistry.

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-1
00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:01.539
I'll like, what's the different
glassware it's called, but it's

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-2
00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:05.521
like the kind of triangular
shaped one that's cylindrical at

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-3
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:09.699
the bottom, but it gets narrow
at the top and a liquid is being

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-4
00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:13.747
poured from it. And there's an
elderly man who's holding this

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-5
00:13:13.747 --> 00:13:17.925
liquid, and he's wearing a white
collared shirt that's buttoned

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-6
00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:22.103
all the way up to the top, and
then he's got kind of what looks

ea45bb32-f57c-482d-94e1-dc937cf97a59-7
00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:22.430
like.

4b1b3e1d-2ac4-47cf-ad36-c643b161b1eb-0
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.981
Like a Wizards cap on, but it's
white, and he and this gentleman

4b1b3e1d-2ac4-47cf-ad36-c643b161b1eb-1
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:31.380
kind of cheers.

32ddc7c1-439e-41c0-8d7a-b3878dfe4559-0
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.696
And it looks like the gentleman
says something to the old man,

32ddc7c1-439e-41c0-8d7a-b3878dfe4559-1
00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:39.375
and he didn't quite catch it, so
he holds his hand up behind his

32ddc7c1-439e-41c0-8d7a-b3878dfe4559-2
00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:42.828
ear to kind of indicate like,
hey, I didn't hear you. And he

32ddc7c1-439e-41c0-8d7a-b3878dfe4559-3
00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:46.564
looks a little confused and then
a little taken aback by whatever

32ddc7c1-439e-41c0-8d7a-b3878dfe4559-4
00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:47.299
the man said.

915832d4-c949-4d84-9460-fc25447ff91b-0
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.200
And then we see him kind of pick
up one of the salt shakers.

db80899f-e7d3-4397-9ef3-0405cce97c40-0
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.378
Or whatever it is. I don't think
it's a salt shaker anymore. It

db80899f-e7d3-4397-9ef3-0405cce97c40-1
00:13:58.378 --> 00:14:02.179
looks like it can squish. So
whatever this item is, he picks

db80899f-e7d3-4397-9ef3-0405cce97c40-2
00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:06.230
it up and squeezes it and now we
are again at a different scene.

1d7674a4-98ec-4413-8948-185eb7b703ec-0
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.860
So this scene involves someone
who is dressed like a soldier.

209747bd-0e63-4cc5-bd8d-295725a92bf0-0
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.480
Into marrying kind of.

44985b3e-2d4b-4f2d-b4eb-c69e876f5716-0
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.732
A large woolen like a Winter
Soldier coat from the olden days

44985b3e-2d4b-4f2d-b4eb-c69e876f5716-1
00:14:20.732 --> 00:14:26.354
that's got a big collar and he's
holding a flower. A small white

44985b3e-2d4b-4f2d-b4eb-c69e876f5716-2
00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:31.630
looks like a Daisy. He's looking
at the flower. He looks up.

c3b386c5-92f8-456b-a7fc-355e520dadc9-0
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.643
And we see him wave, and then we
see who he's waving to. And

c3b386c5-92f8-456b-a7fc-355e520dadc9-1
00:14:35.643 --> 00:14:38.862
there's a woman in the window
who's dropping these flowers,

c3b386c5-92f8-456b-a7fc-355e520dadc9-2
00:14:38.862 --> 00:14:42.297
and it zooms in on her face, and
it zooms in on the flowers and

c3b386c5-92f8-456b-a7fc-355e520dadc9-3
00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:44.390
then kind of zooms out and we
see her.

07e593a7-4b31-4045-9da0-f6bbb9940da6-0
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.630
Kind of raining these flowers
on.

5754af1e-1bbe-414c-a220-0ffac362f667-0
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.090
Not a pack of soldiers, but.

b31f2f27-26d5-477e-a561-1ac896a34534-0
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.715
It's like a battalion of
soldiers marching through the

b31f2f27-26d5-477e-a561-1ac896a34534-1
00:14:54.715 --> 00:14:58.394
streets and so they all are just
the same and they all have these

b31f2f27-26d5-477e-a561-1ac896a34534-2
00:14:58.394 --> 00:15:01.070
pointy hats on as they walk
through the street.

534e8f92-b035-48a8-8f6e-fcb19b0a2022-0
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.422
Now we kind of zoom out even
further and we see that they're

534e8f92-b035-48a8-8f6e-fcb19b0a2022-1
00:15:08.422 --> 00:15:10.080
leaving what looks like a town.

9bd83fe6-dfe5-4472-9464-c8d5c08f24b3-0
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.570
Umm.

589a441e-a588-43e8-8bfe-546b2ef438e0-0
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.709
Looks like a country town in a
way. There's kind of rolling

589a441e-a588-43e8-8bfe-546b2ef438e0-1
00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:21.591
hills in the background, a clock
tower and then just various like

589a441e-a588-43e8-8bfe-546b2ef438e0-2
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:26.252
brick and stone buildings with
little flags on top and the the

589a441e-a588-43e8-8bfe-546b2ef438e0-3
00:15:26.252 --> 00:15:30.470
road is made of what looks like
cobblestones and we see.

8b03cb0c-c558-4aa7-8f64-24d6086d4537-0
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.086
But I assume it's like the
general at the front who's

8b03cb0c-c558-4aa7-8f64-24d6086d4537-1
00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:38.674
holding a weapon over his
shoulder as he marches, a

8b03cb0c-c558-4aa7-8f64-24d6086d4537-2
00:15:38.674 --> 00:15:41.090
gentleman with a large space
drum.

da9420e9-a3ba-401f-83ae-ae0392efdaa8-0
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.342
And then the rest of the
battalion is kind of following

da9420e9-a3ba-401f-83ae-ae0392efdaa8-1
00:15:45.342 --> 00:15:45.680
behind.

c5c9fe00-57fb-4b94-8648-951b5a264196-0
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.166
Then we kind of zoom in on their
feet. We'll see where they're

c5c9fe00-57fb-4b94-8648-951b5a264196-1
00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:55.733
walking. So it goes from like
cobblestone to stone to stand to

c5c9fe00-57fb-4b94-8648-951b5a264196-2
00:15:55.733 --> 00:15:59.792
stones on sand, to stones that
look like they're moving

c5c9fe00-57fb-4b94-8648-951b5a264196-3
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:04.214
upwards. So they're climbing.
And then it turns kind of more

c5c9fe00-57fb-4b94-8648-951b5a264196-4
00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:08.563
into like a Cliff that they're
going through. And then it's

c5c9fe00-57fb-4b94-8648-951b5a264196-5
00:16:08.563 --> 00:16:13.129
water, then it's like river rock
that looks slippery and then.

9cc270c5-b66c-42ab-a7d0-0417261d0d54-0
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.296
A different train and then they
start to run. So they're their

9cc270c5-b66c-42ab-a7d0-0417261d0d54-1
00:16:17.296 --> 00:16:20.315
legs are getting faster and it
looks like they're really

9cc270c5-b66c-42ab-a7d0-0417261d0d54-2
00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:23.546
starting to Sprint and it seems
more so like they're running

9cc270c5-b66c-42ab-a7d0-0417261d0d54-3
00:16:23.546 --> 00:16:25.930
from something than they're
going somewhere.

f0d829e1-9d3a-44e8-8897-5c51b3f00f5e-0
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.423
So the scene starts to get
really dark and we see these

f0d829e1-9d3a-44e8-8897-5c51b3f00f5e-1
00:16:33.423 --> 00:16:33.860
soldiers.

7cd35d47-535e-4260-b7fd-6b0b8210ea36-0
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.200
Running in a a dismal.

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-0
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.236
Backgrounds. There's a large
puffy cloud, and at the top it's

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-1
00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:46.302
still got some lightness to it,
but at the bottom it's a very

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-2
00:16:46.302 --> 00:16:50.303
dark Gray, like a large storm is
coming. And then the ground

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-3
00:16:50.303 --> 00:16:54.631
where they're running looks like
it's kind of ablaze with fire in

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-4
00:16:54.631 --> 00:16:58.566
the background. So they're
backlit and all the soldiers are

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-5
00:16:58.566 --> 00:17:02.764
silhouettes and they're running
with their their guns, and they

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-6
00:17:02.764 --> 00:17:06.896
have bayonets on the end. And
then we see an image of piles of

c3f8e9c6-5240-43d4-aa5b-30e1d07db144-7
00:17:06.896 --> 00:17:07.879
skeleton bones.

059932e0-0bc7-4406-9e92-19841fc4a40f-0
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.740
Of human bones.

03e70c05-6944-4956-a8ab-b591d2e30bd4-0
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.731
Kind of scattered about in what
looks like a mass grave or a

03e70c05-6944-4956-a8ab-b591d2e30bd4-1
00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:15.900
field or something.

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-0
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.505
Now we kind of come to what
looks like the story of one of

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-1
00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:29.767
these soldiers. He's missing his
right leg, and so he's got a

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-2
00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:33.892
pair of crutches and his right
leg is bandaged at where the

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-3
00:17:33.892 --> 00:17:38.222
knee is. And the little piece of
bandage dangles down and he's

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-4
00:17:38.222 --> 00:17:42.622
kind of hobbling on his crutches
and he falls over. He goes and

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-5
00:17:42.622 --> 00:17:46.746
he gets himself back up and he
keeps going. And then we see

308a018a-0497-4f38-b219-bb919aae2bd9-6
00:17:46.746 --> 00:17:50.940
what he's approaching and he's
approaching the ruins of the.

95ed5d98-d360-405e-b1c0-072267b6166d-0
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.570
Village they had previously
left, and so it's no longer.

ad72e9a8-2473-4c6d-b768-3ab1c16924e3-0
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.099
Um, kind of this nice country
village with flags and pretty

ad72e9a8-2473-4c6d-b768-3ab1c16924e3-1
00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:03.829
brick and cobblestone buildings.
It's it looks like it's been

ad72e9a8-2473-4c6d-b768-3ab1c16924e3-2
00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:07.498
bombed. There's smoke kind of
still billowing out of places,

ad72e9a8-2473-4c6d-b768-3ab1c16924e3-3
00:18:07.498 --> 00:18:11.288
all the windows are blown out,
there's no roofs on everything,

ad72e9a8-2473-4c6d-b768-3ab1c16924e3-4
00:18:11.288 --> 00:18:14.657
and everything is kind of a
whitish Gray, as if it were

ad72e9a8-2473-4c6d-b768-3ab1c16924e3-5
00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:15.560
covered in ash.

ca4afd10-33b2-4bbb-a821-8062c3a7ecb2-0
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.734
So now we're kind of back to
that old man, and it almost

ca4afd10-33b2-4bbb-a821-8062c3a7ecb2-1
00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.877
seems like that old man is the
one who is telling the story of

ca4afd10-33b2-4bbb-a821-8062c3a7ecb2-2
00:18:25.877 --> 00:18:29.071
this. But we don't know that for
sure. That's just me making an

ca4afd10-33b2-4bbb-a821-8062c3a7ecb2-3
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:31.915
assumption. But we're back to
the old man who had poured

ca4afd10-33b2-4bbb-a821-8062c3a7ecb2-4
00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:34.460
something from the beaker to
that other gentleman.

f16d9f20-3deb-4179-aa66-30f9a0c49b58-0
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.350
And we see the back of his head
and he turns around and he pulls

f16d9f20-3deb-4179-aa66-30f9a0c49b58-1
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.710
out what looks like a pocket
watch, looks at it.

8f0ffd0a-ef49-4a37-b01e-79d37a6975cc-0
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.230
Just talking to the man and
point them in One Direction.

7be1f402-c40a-4881-9488-23ae99197b8a-0
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.758
That man goes and he gets his
coat and his hat. He punches

7be1f402-c40a-4881-9488-23ae99197b8a-1
00:18:48.758 --> 00:18:52.792
out. I'm using one of those old
time punchers that's still the

7be1f402-c40a-4881-9488-23ae99197b8a-2
00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:56.699
piece of paper that you slide
in. And then he and his little

7be1f402-c40a-4881-9488-23ae99197b8a-3
00:18:56.699 --> 00:19:00.734
creature start walking and they
go to what looks like a ticket

7be1f402-c40a-4881-9488-23ae99197b8a-4
00:19:00.734 --> 00:19:04.768
booth for something. So there's
a rope and there's a long line

7be1f402-c40a-4881-9488-23ae99197b8a-5
00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:07.010
of people and there's two
windows.

413e4d5c-fa9f-4932-af48-b6802d0b64e2-0
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.280
And he pulled out a stack of
paper money.

c7aed8b9-5a4a-412b-80aa-6ca478989592-0
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.520
And we see that he has the old
man with him.

ff54de63-c566-4898-945c-c45e656c89ee-0
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.066
Who now has a jacket on as well,
and we're not entirely sure

ff54de63-c566-4898-945c-c45e656c89ee-1
00:19:19.066 --> 00:19:22.390
where they're going, but they
come to a large archway.

31469715-06f6-4362-9b7a-181c080658ef-0
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.859
And then we see it looks like
it's the exit of a big building

31469715-06f6-4362-9b7a-181c080658ef-1
00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:28.280
in the middle of a city.

af0ca6d3-d52b-4044-b2c6-48e61a3e8143-0
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.860
We see the two of them.

8b1bff32-ad92-49fd-8f8f-6e8813a17c37-0
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.725
Locking along. It's far away,
but it almost looks as if the

8b1bff32-ad92-49fd-8f8f-6e8813a17c37-1
00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:39.777
old man's right leg is skinnier
than left, and that makes me

8b1bff32-ad92-49fd-8f8f-6e8813a17c37-2
00:19:39.777 --> 00:19:44.162
think that maybe this is the man
from the story. But now he has a

8b1bff32-ad92-49fd-8f8f-6e8813a17c37-3
00:19:44.162 --> 00:19:45.690
prosthetic on that leg.

3a7f551b-87f0-4e7c-99bf-932d3481ffea-0
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.510
So.

9d2a091b-564c-4a9d-8ba4-a301ffb4ea64-0
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.346
We see the old man kind of pick
something up and then he reaches

9d2a091b-564c-4a9d-8ba4-a301ffb4ea64-1
00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:57.196
into his pocket and he's got
himself a little creature and it

9d2a091b-564c-4a9d-8ba4-a301ffb4ea64-2
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:57.880
looks like.

56216ad0-9294-4940-b577-fcad4bffaf51-0
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.240
Like it fits in the palm of his
hand and it looks lizardfish,

56216ad0-9294-4940-b577-fcad4bffaf51-1
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.913
but then it kind of takes flight
out of his hand and almost looks

56216ad0-9294-4940-b577-fcad4bffaf51-2
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:09.086
like a fish that's flying
through the sky. And the other

56216ad0-9294-4940-b577-fcad4bffaf51-3
00:20:09.086 --> 00:20:12.536
man looks up, kind of Shields
his eyes from the sun so we can

56216ad0-9294-4940-b577-fcad4bffaf51-4
00:20:12.536 --> 00:20:13.650
watch it fly around.

20dbc60a-c39e-4111-bdbc-55c026e73bfd-0
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.486
So now we're kind of the the two
men are in a field, and there's

20dbc60a-c39e-4111-bdbc-55c026e73bfd-1
00:20:24.486 --> 00:20:26.730
more of these little creatures.
There's.

8cb17c17-93b1-42c7-b6e5-dffc8229ecc5-0
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.462
It looks like these creatures
come from this leaf like plant

8cb17c17-93b1-42c7-b6e5-dffc8229ecc5-1
00:20:32.462 --> 00:20:37.008
that's kind of along the side of
the field and as they're walking

8cb17c17-93b1-42c7-b6e5-dffc8229ecc5-2
00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:41.280
you can kind of see these little
fish birds flying around and

8cb17c17-93b1-42c7-b6e5-dffc8229ecc5-3
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.380
there's a big ball of light in
the sky that.

26cd3aa4-3cdc-4e19-bbdb-5a2967da07c7-0
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.330
Looks like the sun, but.

6c6e17b6-6fb7-491a-933b-de5e2bf7e900-0
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.200
Like drawn and it's got.

6d220f6c-d036-4cdf-96c1-0669ceda9093-0
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:58.380
Like a Halo of light around it.
And it gets bigger as they keep

6d220f6c-d036-4cdf-96c1-0669ceda9093-1
00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.150
walking.

fb5037ad-70c1-4945-9c9b-143ac05fccef-0
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.638
So now the men, as they're
walking, seem to come across

fb5037ad-70c1-4945-9c9b-143ac05fccef-1
00:21:08.638 --> 00:21:10.690
three additional people.

c712ccdc-3859-4af3-95f7-748e4ba3d85f-0
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.821
They seem friendly because
they're waving their arms at

c712ccdc-3859-4af3-95f7-748e4ba3d85f-1
00:21:14.821 --> 00:21:17.710
them as they approach, and as
they get closer, they.

48546bd6-d455-4f98-8b59-5a18a3e11d04-0
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.010
Introduce themselves.

0bb7e5bb-987e-4f7c-a7f1-530cd2d4bc8f-0
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.459
They're talking, they're shaking
hands. The three men all have

0bb7e5bb-987e-4f7c-a7f1-530cd2d4bc8f-1
00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:28.440
little pets, so one looks like a
hedgehog or something, the other

0bb7e5bb-987e-4f7c-a7f1-530cd2d4bc8f-2
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.058
one looks like a Chipmunk, 1
looks like a raccoon, and then

0bb7e5bb-987e-4f7c-a7f1-530cd2d4bc8f-3
00:21:32.058 --> 00:21:34.230
the other one is some sort of
bird.

a24feaf4-1b07-4dac-a66f-8c13a53d2ce6-0
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:41.904
And the men then looked like
either give or receive something

a24feaf4-1b07-4dac-a66f-8c13a53d2ce6-1
00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:43.710
to the other men.

30ab450b-0eb2-4096-becf-7db068bf4f40-0
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.500
Umm.

5d698449-c832-4f94-97e9-a1c2cda6eae2-0
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.707
It looks like it's a ball to a
game and it looks, it's about

5d698449-c832-4f94-97e9-a1c2cda6eae2-1
00:21:49.707 --> 00:21:53.145
the size of like a bocci ball.
And there are these little cones

5d698449-c832-4f94-97e9-a1c2cda6eae2-2
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.369
set up and so it looks like
they're going to play this game

5d698449-c832-4f94-97e9-a1c2cda6eae2-3
00:21:56.369 --> 00:21:57.820
on top of this little hill.

84f44d96-e28e-42f5-958f-b3b769b9c943-0
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.755
And so it kind of zooms out and
you can see that they're in like

84f44d96-e28e-42f5-958f-b3b769b9c943-1
00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:06.249
a rolling field, almost like
like Switzerland, but hills

84f44d96-e28e-42f5-958f-b3b769b9c943-2
00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:09.560
instead of mountains. And
they're at the top one, and

84f44d96-e28e-42f5-958f-b3b769b9c943-3
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.423
they're playing this game with
balls and cones as their little

84f44d96-e28e-42f5-958f-b3b769b9c943-4
00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:16.550
animals watch on. And there's
five of them total.}

17588e17-d04b-4b95-af7a-5e5cf47aa74e-0
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.590
Thank you for that. So now we
move on to the next item.

b70fd6be-4c70-49cd-bf83-d858d84dd1af-0
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:30.680
It's a longer story, so you can
include fewer details.

6a385c3a-0673-4af6-847a-ff94644a7023-0
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.400
Yeah. And then whenever you're
ready, you can start, OK?

511b640c-746b-4fb5-83f4-64e98e252e72-0
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.085
#START_wanderer So this story is
about 2 characters. One is a

511b640c-746b-4fb5-83f4-64e98e252e72-1
00:22:42.085 --> 00:22:42.390
man.

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-0
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.854
Who is dressed like an average
person and then the other is a

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-1
00:22:47.854 --> 00:22:52.814
man who's kind of dressed like a
demon or something. He's got a

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-2
00:22:52.814 --> 00:22:57.541
black outfit that has a white
horn coming out of the top and

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-3
00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:02.500
then a long black cloak and they
are on what looks like a giant

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-4
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.150
post-it pad. And so they peel
off a piece of paper and they

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-5
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:12.110
start to fold it and they fold
it into a paper boat and then it

be78da61-e4b3-4749-9f9e-0b87355ea471-6
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.659
looks like they get.

26699376-4f34-4ef8-b804-d1c4e085530a-0
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.020
Onto this boat and they are on
the water.

4f4d93af-d2dc-44fc-8385-e873bf695a55-0
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.565
And they start to approach this
large magnificent ship that has

4f4d93af-d2dc-44fc-8385-e873bf695a55-1
00:23:21.565 --> 00:23:25.939
like big building circular
sails, a submarine component to

4f4d93af-d2dc-44fc-8385-e873bf695a55-2
00:23:25.939 --> 00:23:30.387
it and what looks like kind of a
tall house slash apartment

4f4d93af-d2dc-44fc-8385-e873bf695a55-3
00:23:30.387 --> 00:23:34.762
building on the back of it. And
so it's it's really large,

4f4d93af-d2dc-44fc-8385-e873bf695a55-4
00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:39.433
complex and their small paper
boat looks miniscule compared to

4f4d93af-d2dc-44fc-8385-e873bf695a55-5
00:23:39.433 --> 00:23:40.990
the size of the ship.

d4777c8d-109c-4b11-b113-bb95d93297ad-0
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.344
So they're on the water. It's
pretty choppy and there's a

d4777c8d-109c-4b11-b113-bb95d93297ad-1
00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:52.922
bunch of sea birds flying around
that have black wings and are

d4777c8d-109c-4b11-b113-bb95d93297ad-2
00:23:52.922 --> 00:23:56.387
predominantly white, and their
boat is just kind of floating

d4777c8d-109c-4b11-b113-bb95d93297ad-3
00:23:56.387 --> 00:23:57.410
through the water.

87c2df9e-4c1a-4faf-833f-4ccad7cd4364-0
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.214
And they aren't on the boat, I
realized. So it's just the

87c2df9e-4c1a-4faf-833f-4ccad7cd4364-1
00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:08.940
little boat. And they are not on
the boat, and some different sea

87c2df9e-4c1a-4faf-833f-4ccad7cd4364-2
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.327
creatures start to notice the
boat. So there's a couple sea

87c2df9e-4c1a-4faf-833f-4ccad7cd4364-3
00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:15.827
turtles that have a checkered
pattern on their back, and then

87c2df9e-4c1a-4faf-833f-4ccad7cd4364-4
00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:18.932
there's what looks like some
sort of whale who kind of

87c2df9e-4c1a-4faf-833f-4ccad7cd4364-5
00:24:18.932 --> 00:24:20.569
splashes up against the boat.

c00a3205-1f5c-431d-88c4-13aee6b6b4c0-0
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.046
We see that it's a killer whale
and the boat kind of gets caught

c00a3205-1f5c-431d-88c4-13aee6b6b4c0-1
00:24:30.046 --> 00:24:34.355
on its dorsal fin and we get a
glimpse at the underwater world.

c00a3205-1f5c-431d-88c4-13aee6b6b4c0-2
00:24:34.355 --> 00:24:36.510
So we're by a coral reef we see.

38628d75-842e-4276-89ff-210c2f303993-0
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:42.534
Swordfish that has a couple of
fish skewered on the end of its

38628d75-842e-4276-89ff-210c2f303993-1
00:24:42.534 --> 00:24:46.916
sword, some schools of fish,
some anemone, and it's all very

38628d75-842e-4276-89ff-210c2f303993-2
00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.640
like circular and flowy.

50005431-dcb5-43c2-931c-d20cbf6f6eff-0
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.786
The we get another image of the
coral reef as the little paper

50005431-dcb5-43c2-931c-d20cbf6f6eff-1
00:24:56.786 --> 00:25:01.072
boat continues to float on top
of the water, so it's just more

50005431-dcb5-43c2-931c-d20cbf6f6eff-2
00:25:01.072 --> 00:25:02.910
like tropical looking fish.

6d4fd5df-bc17-4f17-ab2f-8dd1e2b1ec6a-0
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.520
Different plants, different sea
life.

04f4bab4-39f3-4120-a47e-aaeec4d6b4e0-0
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.120
And schools of fish swimming
around.

5222b932-6078-4260-a0c7-f2eb71d6b0fc-0
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.208
OK, maybe they are on the boat.
So we see that there's like a

5222b932-6078-4260-a0c7-f2eb71d6b0fc-1
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:23.968
little squid like guy who
attaches himself to the bottom

5222b932-6078-4260-a0c7-f2eb71d6b0fc-2
00:25:23.968 --> 00:25:26.870
of the boat and then we see what
look like.

49f8fcbf-ea4f-4dfe-8e3f-796330ae86a9-0
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.380
Not like they're like fish
people, so they have fish heads,

49f8fcbf-ea4f-4dfe-8e3f-796330ae86a9-1
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.190
but like.

149df562-8a2f-43d3-a889-994e9d1db31f-0
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.523
Lizard bodies almost and they're
kissing. And then we see

149df562-8a2f-43d3-a889-994e9d1db31f-1
00:25:41.523 --> 00:25:46.230
additional fish and on the next
page we do see a fishing pole.

2d52bcf8-290d-473f-93db-4d4cb65e2d90-0
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.555
Um, hang out the side of the
paper boat and it's dangling

2d52bcf8-290d-473f-93db-4d4cb65e2d90-1
00:25:50.555 --> 00:25:54.242
down into the water and one of
the fish is caught on it, and

2d52bcf8-290d-473f-93db-4d4cb65e2d90-2
00:25:54.242 --> 00:25:57.567
then we see one of those fish
people holding a pair of

2d52bcf8-290d-473f-93db-4d4cb65e2d90-3
00:25:57.567 --> 00:25:59.319
scissors looking at the line.

9e5a0606-ff86-4c88-a785-19937b3f6f34-0
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.730
So these fish kind of have
awareness it seems like.

888195c5-8d41-4080-8e4c-fd8dbce821ae-0
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:13.065
So the fish kind of work
together and one of the bigger

888195c5-8d41-4080-8e4c-fd8dbce821ae-1
00:26:13.065 --> 00:26:16.960
fish takes a smaller fish who's
wearing a similar.

60b9c4c1-54d2-40e3-811e-77fd3a037da2-0
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:23.480
Paper folding on his head like a
hat. And the fish that's

60b9c4c1-54d2-40e3-811e-77fd3a037da2-1
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.720
wearing, that is.

b2a5e488-76ac-4ba7-b13a-68e0363fd18c-0
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.548
Like a seahorse. So the one fish
kind of has the seahorse on the

b2a5e488-76ac-4ba7-b13a-68e0363fd18c-1
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:36.267
front of his face and pops them
out of the water so he can see

b2a5e488-76ac-4ba7-b13a-68e0363fd18c-2
00:26:36.267 --> 00:26:40.910
into the boat. And then that
seahorse hops into the boat, and

b2a5e488-76ac-4ba7-b13a-68e0363fd18c-3
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:45.554
then a bunch of Stingrays come
and looks like a manta ray and

b2a5e488-76ac-4ba7-b13a-68e0363fd18c-4
00:26:45.554 --> 00:26:49.898
an eel, and the eel kind of
slither slithers up and tucks

b2a5e488-76ac-4ba7-b13a-68e0363fd18c-5
00:26:49.898 --> 00:26:52.519
his head into the tip of the
boat.

5b428e95-a05d-4042-9e04-d73dd312c965-0
00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.682
The boat continues on top of the
water and they come to what

5b428e95-a05d-4042-9e04-d73dd312c965-1
00:27:00.682 --> 00:27:01.710
looks like a little.

19cd7dde-cca5-46ad-b863-47471871daa8-0
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:07.788
Vegetation spot. There's some
small little plant sticking out

19cd7dde-cca5-46ad-b863-47471871daa8-1
00:27:07.788 --> 00:27:12.953
of the water that have little
petals and then there's like a

19cd7dde-cca5-46ad-b863-47471871daa8-2
00:27:12.953 --> 00:27:17.693
large tree slash Bush like
structure that has what look

19cd7dde-cca5-46ad-b863-47471871daa8-3
00:27:17.693 --> 00:27:23.027
like white cranes, a bunch of
them sitting in various areas of

19cd7dde-cca5-46ad-b863-47471871daa8-4
00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:24.889
this large vegetation.

370a35f1-8023-466a-aeb6-3fa3f4860f02-0
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.078
So the boat kind of works its
way into the vegetation. We see

370a35f1-8023-466a-aeb6-3fa3f4860f02-1
00:27:33.078 --> 00:27:36.466
that they're individual plants
that kind of anchor themselves

370a35f1-8023-466a-aeb6-3fa3f4860f02-2
00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:39.799
down into the water. So it's a
little shallower here and the

370a35f1-8023-466a-aeb6-3fa3f4860f02-3
00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:40.509
root systems.

6c7e0664-21c6-49ab-af12-96262569a2a4-0
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.060
Kind of look like if you were to
build like a structure out of

6c7e0664-21c6-49ab-af12-96262569a2a4-1
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.711
sticks and like stack them up
together into like a triangular

6c7e0664-21c6-49ab-af12-96262569a2a4-2
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:53.304
pattern, they're just kind of
all coming together at the top

6c7e0664-21c6-49ab-af12-96262569a2a4-3
00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.070
and then the.

487e0302-0087-4d64-b695-d253373f8007-0
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:55.740
Bush.

db410278-3f0d-4c62-bef5-a521b9ace388-0
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.656
Sprouts out from there and then
we just kind of see the boat

db410278-3f0d-4c62-bef5-a521b9ace388-1
00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:02.661
getting further into this
vegetation and the little fish

db410278-3f0d-4c62-bef5-a521b9ace388-2
00:28:02.661 --> 00:28:05.667
are still under the water
looking on and there's a large

db410278-3f0d-4c62-bef5-a521b9ace388-3
00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:06.879
school of fish as well.

2a7000e0-ae48-4ba6-969a-3ed6590a3ec2-0
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.488
So as they get deeper into this
vegetation, it gets a little

2a7000e0-ae48-4ba6-969a-3ed6590a3ec2-1
00:28:14.488 --> 00:28:14.880
darker.

02faf92b-6e80-4e94-9b5f-cf5ac7dd4ce5-0
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.685
And we see a small bird and then
we see a lot of creatures with

02faf92b-6e80-4e94-9b5f-cf5ac7dd4ce5-1
00:28:19.685 --> 00:28:22.370
kind of glowing eyes. Some of
them look like.

a088338c-c49a-4dcd-aae5-0f5edb14316f-0
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.340
Lizards, and some of them look
like birds, but it's definitely

a088338c-c49a-4dcd-aae5-0f5edb14316f-1
00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:31.535
a lot darker in here than it was
when they were outside of this

a088338c-c49a-4dcd-aae5-0f5edb14316f-2
00:28:31.535 --> 00:28:32.650
vegetation patch.

aa337e8e-750c-4466-93c2-0d49fcebc5be-0
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.070
And the little seahorse is still
on this boat.

dc4394ec-a783-47e2-9962-f67808f39cdb-0
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.290
So they come out the other side
and we see another.

3badd442-3a45-4f7a-a1cd-95bffb2cb70e-0
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.140
And a hybrid creature.

c1bc38ef-1f96-4539-9cb3-3cd33c679a19-0
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:50.029
This one, I don't know what kind
of fish that is, but he's got

c1bc38ef-1f96-4539-9cb3-3cd33c679a19-1
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:52.920
like polka dots and then like
some.

8793ef1e-e773-4731-b845-425f2e42581b-0
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.986
wavy dorsal fins on the back and
then a lizard like body and he's

8793ef1e-e773-4731-b845-425f2e42581b-1
00:28:58.986 --> 00:29:02.780
riding like a shrimp or a
lobster like a horse.

73d5522e-7454-485f-a976-46691309d362-0
00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:09.199
And they continue on, and the
little seahorse jumps out of the

73d5522e-7454-485f-a976-46691309d362-1
00:29:09.199 --> 00:29:10.860
ship and loses his hat.

64fd0fb9-e4ec-4937-ba35-704959ce8aaa-0
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.082
But he is with some other
seahorses and so it looks like

64fd0fb9-e4ec-4937-ba35-704959ce8aaa-1
00:29:15.082 --> 00:29:17.780
the boat is going to continue on
without him.

e0eee0eb-bcc9-4483-9136-26db35c71b6c-0
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.971
Um, the boat does continue on
and we come across a large

e0eee0eb-bcc9-4483-9136-26db35c71b6c-1
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:31.005
whale. The top of his head is
sticking out of the water and

e0eee0eb-bcc9-4483-9136-26db35c71b6c-2
00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:35.039
there are some birds on it and
it looks like he's smoking a

e0eee0eb-bcc9-4483-9136-26db35c71b6c-3
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.720
pipe out of his blowhole.

5bbeb8d8-1285-4ada-80b9-7eb6e05cd402-0
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:42.026
Umm, it's kind of dopey looking
and there are some fish swimming

5bbeb8d8-1285-4ada-80b9-7eb6e05cd402-1
00:29:42.026 --> 00:29:45.844
around and the boat just
continues on and then we see

5bbeb8d8-1285-4ada-80b9-7eb6e05cd402-2
00:29:45.844 --> 00:29:50.016
like it looks like a large
anglerfish mixed with Godzilla.

5bbeb8d8-1285-4ada-80b9-7eb6e05cd402-3
00:29:50.016 --> 00:29:54.400
Like it's got the teeth of an
anglerfish. It's got the little

5bbeb8d8-1285-4ada-80b9-7eb6e05cd402-4
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.290
light bulb thing that an
anglerfish has, but it's got.

a8b3b14f-4513-4c8c-9df8-3e1fd9fb91ae-0
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.738
The body of Godzilla, and it's
big and it's standing on top of

a8b3b14f-4513-4c8c-9df8-3e1fd9fb91ae-1
00:30:02.738 --> 00:30:06.185
a pile of a bunch of wrecked
ships and it's almost got like

a8b3b14f-4513-4c8c-9df8-3e1fd9fb91ae-2
00:30:06.185 --> 00:30:09.517
little barnacles and things
sticking out of its back, but

a8b3b14f-4513-4c8c-9df8-3e1fd9fb91ae-3
00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:11.930
the boat is going right towards
its face.

121048b6-a598-4200-aa75-661f471fc971-0
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.920
Um, so.

6605a946-e058-4388-94cf-c761a4301295-0
00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.218
The boat continues on. There's a
lot of other kind of bizarre

6605a946-e058-4388-94cf-c761a4301295-1
00:30:22.218 --> 00:30:25.739
creatures, and it looks like the
sun is starting to set. You can

6605a946-e058-4388-94cf-c761a4301295-2
00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:28.934
see it just dipping over the
horizon in the background and

6605a946-e058-4388-94cf-c761a4301295-3
00:30:28.934 --> 00:30:30.559
the moon is kind of coming up.

86cd54b0-94df-46d5-8fbd-52a0e2235715-0
00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:36.493
Um, and we get a glimpse at even
more creatures. And they're all

86cd54b0-94df-46d5-8fbd-52a0e2235715-1
00:30:36.493 --> 00:30:41.207
kind of like combination of land
and sea creatures. So we see

86cd54b0-94df-46d5-8fbd-52a0e2235715-2
00:30:41.207 --> 00:30:44.630
like a Jaguar that has like
little fin like.

4389ad96-5102-42a0-9a82-187f11376ef7-0
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.501
Projections coming out of its
hands. And then we see an

4389ad96-5102-42a0-9a82-187f11376ef7-1
00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:54.560
elephant whose ears look more
like the fins of a fish.

f6e3b09a-6b3d-47c0-9fee-33fb20a4c283-0
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.965
You see a a horse with like
octopus tentacle body and like a

f6e3b09a-6b3d-47c0-9fee-33fb20a4c283-1
00:30:59.965 --> 00:31:04.053
zebra. So there's just a bunch
of these kind of combination

f6e3b09a-6b3d-47c0-9fee-33fb20a4c283-2
00:31:04.053 --> 00:31:08.413
creatures all popping out of the
water and one of them is looks

f6e3b09a-6b3d-47c0-9fee-33fb20a4c283-3
00:31:08.413 --> 00:31:10.729
like a black cat or like a
lemur.

59666310-66b7-45c1-a6e3-8b5a9a5264f8-0
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.640
And it's hopping into the paper
boat.

436b20d5-e62f-4f7a-a972-c506a52d98f6-0
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.400
And the boat continues on and
it's night time now.

ee49ab5e-e5db-4f59-9446-2f3f134de900-0
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.305
And the moon changed phases,
which is interesting. It used to

ee49ab5e-e5db-4f59-9446-2f3f134de900-1
00:31:25.305 --> 00:31:29.266
be a full moon and now it's a
crescent moon, but you can see

ee49ab5e-e5db-4f59-9446-2f3f134de900-2
00:31:29.266 --> 00:31:33.162
the Milky Way in the sky and
there's a lot of stars and the

ee49ab5e-e5db-4f59-9446-2f3f134de900-3
00:31:33.162 --> 00:31:37.447
boat is floating on top of water
and underneath the water you can

ee49ab5e-e5db-4f59-9446-2f3f134de900-4
00:31:37.447 --> 00:31:39.850
just see the glow of all these
eyes.

a510909a-bbae-49cc-9f87-70306cff79e0-0
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.276
And you see a bunch of like,
little bodies of creatures kind

a510909a-bbae-49cc-9f87-70306cff79e0-1
00:31:44.276 --> 00:31:47.866
of gathering underneath where
the boat are. And it's very it's

a510909a-bbae-49cc-9f87-70306cff79e0-2
00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:51.285
kind of ominous looking with
this little white boat and all

a510909a-bbae-49cc-9f87-70306cff79e0-3
00:31:51.285 --> 00:31:54.648
these glowing eyes and bodies
underneath the surface as it

a510909a-bbae-49cc-9f87-70306cff79e0-4
00:31:54.648 --> 00:31:56.130
floats around in the dark.

7490939e-8d8a-44d5-be88-da3c3e3c2618-0
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.650
So.

a3a4c900-f996-4e8a-b177-1e8657d69951-0
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.027
Whatever those little creatures
were, they they must have

a3a4c900-f996-4e8a-b177-1e8657d69951-1
00:32:02.027 --> 00:32:04.769
surfaced. And they come up to
this boat and we see that it's

a3a4c900-f996-4e8a-b177-1e8657d69951-2
00:32:04.769 --> 00:32:07.331
kind of like a school of fish.
And they all just kind of

a3a4c900-f996-4e8a-b177-1e8657d69951-3
00:32:07.331 --> 00:32:08.410
surround the boat as if.

2277c190-3c56-4ce0-90c4-df97600d1a6d-0
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.804
Um, it almost looks like a mosh
pit. Like there's one person in

2277c190-3c56-4ce0-90c4-df97600d1a6d-1
00:32:12.804 --> 00:32:15.850
the middle and then the rest are
surrounding the boat.

834f13c1-f0f6-4d01-800a-f183d8235cc3-0
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.590
But they leave it alone. They,
you know, check it out and

834f13c1-f0f6-4d01-800a-f183d8235cc3-1
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.505
they're like, not that
interesting. And the boat

834f13c1-f0f6-4d01-800a-f183d8235cc3-2
00:32:25.505 --> 00:32:29.075
continues on and we see that
there are some Northern Lights

834f13c1-f0f6-4d01-800a-f183d8235cc3-3
00:32:29.075 --> 00:32:30.860
in the sky now over the water.

5c5537c6-c7d9-45e1-8fc6-8a6bcbc721a9-0
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.681
And the boat comes across a very
large iceberg. So this iceberg

5c5537c6-c7d9-45e1-8fc6-8a6bcbc721a9-1
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:40.290
is like.

34e2e160-0b9d-427e-8075-eabff170c355-0
00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.368
Stories high and like blocks
wide. It's very large and

34e2e160-0b9d-427e-8075-eabff170c355-1
00:32:45.368 --> 00:32:48.290
slightly angled, so it's not
perfect.

00f40ccf-1a26-4276-8233-28b2b867d526-0
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.097
The boat continues on and it
comes to what looked like some

00f40ccf-1a26-4276-8233-28b2b867d526-1
00:32:55.097 --> 00:32:57.540
like sea caves or maybe lava
tube tunnels.

eadac650-bf33-44b0-8170-6d5354bad1ec-0
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.010
There's.

c6095b5f-e6bf-43b6-b78d-2d969a87cea7-0
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.903
Like some floating ice in the
water. So we kind of can maybe

c6095b5f-e6bf-43b6-b78d-2d969a87cea7-1
00:33:04.903 --> 00:33:08.192
assume maybe well no there's
lava, there's volcanoes up

c6095b5f-e6bf-43b6-b78d-2d969a87cea7-2
00:33:08.192 --> 00:33:11.657
there, but the the boat makes
its way into the tunnels and

c6095b5f-e6bf-43b6-b78d-2d969a87cea7-3
00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:13.890
it's circular and there's arches
and.

7291357b-afc8-47cf-894f-c5f5e3ef9b3d-0
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.280
Yeah, just very cavernous.

677c93fd-914e-4f1a-82c1-69547e66c46a-0
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.742
The boat exits the little tunnel
area and it comes out to the

677c93fd-914e-4f1a-82c1-69547e66c46a-1
00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:28.530
side of a Cliff, which looks
like it's made of ice.

8e2fe288-734e-470a-ab3b-97162661dc0b-0
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.616
And we see kind of a tendril
stick out of the water, almost

8e2fe288-734e-470a-ab3b-97162661dc0b-1
00:33:33.616 --> 00:33:38.021
like a desk lamp, and it shines
a light on the boat. So the boat

8e2fe288-734e-470a-ab3b-97162661dc0b-2
00:33:38.021 --> 00:33:42.291
is in the spotlight and then a
large creature comes out of the

8e2fe288-734e-470a-ab3b-97162661dc0b-3
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:43.240
water wearing.

7e018c3b-c512-4f74-8bb3-dbce4bad846e-0
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:48.206
Like an old school scuba diver
outfit, it's got like the big

7e018c3b-c512-4f74-8bb3-dbce4bad846e-1
00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:51.110
metal helmet that sits on your
shoulders.

4a64f75b-16c1-4848-9583-7b216a9470ba-0
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.090
There's like a tank on his back
and.

d1478faf-9186-48fb-a546-8d94eff30979-0
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.946
This thing doesn't look human,
but it does at the same time.

d1478faf-9186-48fb-a546-8d94eff30979-1
00:33:58.946 --> 00:33:59.860
But it's got like.

47beb2d2-c15c-4a00-a46b-4b56c81bba07-0
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.515
Little fin things for hands, and
it's got a tail, so we know that

47beb2d2-c15c-4a00-a46b-4b56c81bba07-1
00:34:05.515 --> 00:34:07.420
it's some sort of sea creature.

a108e0ea-b6a3-4e46-b069-18490b1ce73f-0
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.756
There's water pouring from its
eyes and then it's holding the

a108e0ea-b6a3-4e46-b069-18490b1ce73f-1
00:34:12.756 --> 00:34:14.410
paper boat in its hand.

5e4046ee-c09a-4377-8a83-47407840c9f3-0
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.714
Let it go. Just looked at it,
OK. We see that the, the little

5e4046ee-c09a-4377-8a83-47407840c9f3-1
00:34:22.714 --> 00:34:26.998
tendril with the light is kind
of dipping back down into the

5e4046ee-c09a-4377-8a83-47407840c9f3-2
00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:31.423
water and then we start to see
large ships. These look like...

5e4046ee-c09a-4377-8a83-47407840c9f3-3
00:34:31.423 --> 00:34:35.496
The other ship that we saw
before was made of wood and it

5e4046ee-c09a-4377-8a83-47407840c9f3-4
00:34:35.496 --> 00:34:36.480
was more like.

2ed36234-e23d-47d5-84f9-69c666e004e6-0
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.250
I don't know colonial like.

13409277-1eaa-4381-9e2c-ea6558ace4e2-0
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.300
The bees are more like.

4986b83e-5311-4102-a3a3-bc6480cade16-0
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.200
Battalion are like shipment
ships made of metal.

1eeb86df-8edb-42a5-a43e-b99c376680ee-0
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:47.400
And.

c590f82d-1ed6-4942-8328-178c29bea943-0
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.300
And or like I guess they're
fishing ships because there's

c590f82d-1ed6-4942-8328-178c29bea943-1
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.787
large Nets dangling on the side
and they look like they're full

c590f82d-1ed6-4942-8328-178c29bea943-2
00:34:54.787 --> 00:34:58.111
of ships or not full of ships
full of fish. And then there's

c590f82d-1ed6-4942-8328-178c29bea943-3
00:34:58.111 --> 00:35:01.435
large billows of smoke coming
out of the smokestacks and our

c590f82d-1ed6-4942-8328-178c29bea943-4
00:35:01.435 --> 00:35:04.487
little boat is just kind of
again towered over by these

c590f82d-1ed6-4942-8328-178c29bea943-5
00:35:04.487 --> 00:35:05.250
massive ships.

69ecc312-ae23-413e-8175-64ff736ceec8-0
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.193
And the boat continues on.
There's some little white birds

69ecc312-ae23-413e-8175-64ff736ceec8-1
00:35:13.193 --> 00:35:16.902
flying in the sky and then
there's this structure kind of

69ecc312-ae23-413e-8175-64ff736ceec8-2
00:35:16.902 --> 00:35:20.100
in the middle of the sea on
three large pedestal.

252d692e-1c07-4e8b-9527-2986fb017cfb-0
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.109
And we see that it looks like
almost like a factory, and

252d692e-1c07-4e8b-9527-2986fb017cfb-1
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:30.286
there's some sort of sea
creature caught on the end of

252d692e-1c07-4e8b-9527-2986fb017cfb-2
00:35:30.286 --> 00:35:34.540
the crane, and it's hanging over
the ocean by its tail.

a0c40d82-d15a-47f9-a04b-bf69ec45c6e0-0
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.383
This little boat is just kind of
approaching whatever this

a0c40d82-d15a-47f9-a04b-bf69ec45c6e0-1
00:35:38.383 --> 00:35:39.370
structure might be.

5faec24e-ca9f-4faf-82cb-0f0c95b69366-0
00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.530
So gets close to there and.

2c743a10-7f82-4681-b90b-7853288bcd2e-0
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.390
Something that's at this
structure starts shooting at it.

2f07c0a2-d804-40d1-a8da-b371704b2b93-0
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.369
There's like a row of windows
that go up vertically, and out

2f07c0a2-d804-40d1-a8da-b371704b2b93-1
00:35:56.369 --> 00:36:00.179
of each of these there's either
a person or a creature with a

2f07c0a2-d804-40d1-a8da-b371704b2b93-2
00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:03.130
gun. And so they're they're
shooting out of it.

4f760a86-7b4f-4afb-b11e-3238c51badb6-0
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.550
And then um.

23d88ed9-0223-4c61-86b9-be90f01b0c9b-0
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.000
There's a.

b2268be0-0ecd-4442-b10c-91af86f269d8-0
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.092
Creature on some sort of device
that like pedals its way through

b2268be0-0ecd-4442-b10c-91af86f269d8-1
00:36:12.092 --> 00:36:16.284
the water. It almost looks like
a rocket and someone is standing

b2268be0-0ecd-4442-b10c-91af86f269d8-2
00:36:16.284 --> 00:36:18.090
on the end of it and like a.

b0741c1e-9a45-45d2-a2c3-b2744ee33fc5-0
00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.331
A radiation suit with a helmet
that's glowing and there is a

b0741c1e-9a45-45d2-a2c3-b2744ee33fc5-1
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:25.500
life preserver.

d2943be4-2ea8-43db-9ec8-3304ff21775f-0
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.400
one that looks like orange
circular ones.

81d7df68-991e-4e3e-b460-cb4de5effecd-0
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.870
Inside the side of.

45cd51c2-410a-4242-8f41-2d651979320a-0
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.090
The paper boat that looks like
it's been hit by one of the

45cd51c2-410a-4242-8f41-2d651979320a-1
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.630
shots from people who were
shooting.

2fae85b3-b980-4137-a19b-6d54e0851308-0
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.257
It seems like whoever that
person was in the radiation suit

2fae85b3-b980-4137-a19b-6d54e0851308-1
00:36:48.257 --> 00:36:50.380
is kind of helping the paper
boat.

609e95b8-4b8a-4148-9499-ca3074d80c17-0
00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.500
It's got them tied.

ec499811-a6b0-49aa-b5b6-69de3374aaea-0
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.210
And it's following them and then
there's like.

b67ddbd1-bf1c-426d-bc37-a453110df409-0
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:02.020
A large conch shell filled with
a bunch of creatures.

5a6b9ae6-6d92-4448-9e3f-e5e95fb8adea-0
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.200
One is like a horse. That
speckled one is.

f1b5aaaa-05ae-4f48-ae3f-469fc387873e-0
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.940
Some sort of stag. One is

feffe03c-be37-4049-9ad7-53baf44bac7e-0
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.056
Like a cat and then a couple of
others that you can't really

feffe03c-be37-4049-9ad7-53baf44bac7e-1
00:37:14.056 --> 00:37:17.262
tell they are. And then we see
in the crow's nest that there

feffe03c-be37-4049-9ad7-53baf44bac7e-2
00:37:17.262 --> 00:37:17.420
is.

d2329453-c7f3-4ca1-9c17-2eee9f086ed6-0
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.731
One of the people from the
beginning, and it's the one that

d2329453-c7f3-4ca1-9c17-2eee9f086ed6-1
00:37:21.731 --> 00:37:25.541
looks like a demon and a black
outfit, so he's in the crow nest

d2329453-c7f3-4ca1-9c17-2eee9f086ed6-2
00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:26.969
crow's nest overlooking.

324a204a-f426-4e4f-b44d-9e632fe37205-0
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.610
um the injured paper boat.

f65aff06-18fc-4515-a050-4b1be64034d5-0
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.691
Then we see a large wave come
and the paper boat gets scooped

f65aff06-18fc-4515-a050-4b1be64034d5-1
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:46.795
up and it's making kind of like
a tunnel that a surfer would

f65aff06-18fc-4515-a050-4b1be64034d5-2
00:37:46.795 --> 00:37:47.670
really enjoy.

f5f3d659-957a-4d3d-9b1e-d64497bc99ac-0
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:54.350
And we see that the sail of the
conch shell ship that our

25853536-239b-4e4b-a9a6-898eb0069e00-0
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.470
Character in Black is on, has
broken and so there's some

25853536-239b-4e4b-a9a6-898eb0069e00-1
00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:04.015
creatures trying to hold it
together. And then we also see

25853536-239b-4e4b-a9a6-898eb0069e00-2
00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:08.790
our creature in black folding a
paper airplane and is getting

25853536-239b-4e4b-a9a6-898eb0069e00-3
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:13.412
ready to throw it towards the
the little paper boat that is

25853536-239b-4e4b-a9a6-898eb0069e00-4
00:38:13.412 --> 00:38:17.110
heading towards being upside
down in the water.

4cb354ba-3428-454f-ba82-fef391d9e276-0
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.637
So a strike of lightning hits
the water and we see the paper

4cb354ba-3428-454f-ba82-fef391d9e276-1
00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:28.060
airplane kind of soaring through
the air.

ac543ab2-59a2-40b5-8399-2e064d8adee4-0
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:39.124
Then we kind of come the the
boat is still floating and there

ac543ab2-59a2-40b5-8399-2e064d8adee4-1
00:38:39.124 --> 00:38:40.350
are these like.

6b8d41a8-5bb0-4e07-a7ab-e806965ba9a4-0
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.680
It looks like.

bd87250d-1eeb-43fe-a693-143b172a89da-0
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:48.594
Like like an eel, but it's
wiggly all over and so it's

bd87250d-1eeb-43fe-a693-143b172a89da-1
00:38:48.594 --> 00:38:50.100
creating like little.

0e481927-ea19-4708-a6cd-b73f2d310982-0
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:56.121
Archways all over the water and
the boat is going underneath one

0e481927-ea19-4708-a6cd-b73f2d310982-1
00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:58.410
and then we see that like a
little.

dc47027d-d803-4efa-afd3-6369564efa01-0
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:04.131
mouth at the end, caught the
paper airplane from one of these

dc47027d-d803-4efa-afd3-6369564efa01-1
00:39:04.131 --> 00:39:04.520
eels.

7c9a4cad-29a3-4e80-9386-869223275d08-0
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:14.063
And then it seems like the mouth
is or like the head of this

7c9a4cad-29a3-4e80-9386-869223275d08-1
00:39:14.063 --> 00:39:18.122
creature is looking for the the
paper boat. The paper boat is

7c9a4cad-29a3-4e80-9386-869223275d08-2
00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:22.181
still kind of working its way
through all the archways of its

7c9a4cad-29a3-4e80-9386-869223275d08-3
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:26.109
body, and it's coming out the
other end and there's like an

7c9a4cad-29a3-4e80-9386-869223275d08-4
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:30.233
alligator with a narwhal horn
and then like a crocodile at the

7c9a4cad-29a3-4e80-9386-869223275d08-5
00:39:30.233 --> 00:39:33.180
end, but it's not quite out of
archways yet.

8e882bcf-e463-40bb-ae17-39df356e44da-0
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.170
And then?

c4f9e35d-f833-40e6-9e41-a24c1ebbba2a-0
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.610
It made it out and.

86945fb8-9de0-45b1-b159-abe5681d442c-0
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.850
The creature with a narwhal horn
is like.

169273bd-8421-421a-a178-93d480c04bc1-0
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.611
Shooting some liquid out of its
nostrils and it's filling up the

169273bd-8421-421a-a178-93d480c04bc1-1
00:39:47.611 --> 00:39:48.250
paper boat.

e1f1fb7e-af56-4939-aac4-480f67b0badc-0
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.820
We see another fish.

90c977f4-e890-4804-b5e0-84f4ce3f7360-0
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:57.652
Lizard combination creature
standing on what looks like a

90c977f4-e890-4804-b5e0-84f4ce3f7360-1
00:39:57.652 --> 00:40:01.955
sandbank and there's a lot of
like debris and litter collected

90c977f4-e890-4804-b5e0-84f4ce3f7360-2
00:40:01.955 --> 00:40:03.800
on it and it's overlooking.

118fb20e-59cf-4970-b1a1-7b95269284be-0
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.601
Um, the paper boat sinking. And
so you see the end of it kind of

118fb20e-59cf-4970-b1a1-7b95269284be-1
00:40:08.601 --> 00:40:10.230
sticking up out of the water.

14545c5d-6485-423f-bddf-8bf157674594-0
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.644
So it's floating down into the
ocean right now. It's kind of

14545c5d-6485-423f-bddf-8bf157674594-1
00:40:19.644 --> 00:40:20.350
floating in.

075b6168-870e-45ba-ae43-01399312d981-0
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.529
What do they call like a group
of jellyfish? A pot of a pot of

075b6168-870e-45ba-ae43-01399312d981-1
00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:29.975
jellyfish? I don't know, but
it's floating in a group of

075b6168-870e-45ba-ae43-01399312d981-2
00:40:29.975 --> 00:40:33.906
jellyfish. Most of them are all
like clear jellies, but there is

075b6168-870e-45ba-ae43-01399312d981-3
00:40:33.906 --> 00:40:36.990
one large Jelly that's striped
and has like large.

bab59e07-d0e0-41ec-8ee1-152db3b65cb2-0
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.870
Tentacle things dangling down
from it.

02061b7c-03c3-4741-9118-6a51297cce23-0
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:46.629
And it gets through that and
it's floating deeper or sinking

02061b7c-03c3-4741-9118-6a51297cce23-1
00:40:46.629 --> 00:40:51.055
deeper into the ocean. Right now
it's in an area that not a lot

02061b7c-03c3-4741-9118-6a51297cce23-2
00:40:51.055 --> 00:40:55.343
of light is penetrating. So we
see a school of fish that have

02061b7c-03c3-4741-9118-6a51297cce23-3
00:40:55.343 --> 00:40:59.839
glowing eyes and we see another
fish that's glowing. And then we

02061b7c-03c3-4741-9118-6a51297cce23-4
00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:04.058
see like an octopus and some
little alien like creatures and

02061b7c-03c3-4741-9118-6a51297cce23-5
00:41:04.058 --> 00:41:06.410
it keeps sinking deeper it
seems.

acdba191-db94-4831-8e63-1da4df38fc93-0
00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.789
Then it's getting down towards
the bottom and it's being

acdba191-db94-4831-8e63-1da4df38fc93-1
00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:16.740
crawled upon by like little.

42328e8e-b213-4453-a613-7224762d8ce3-0
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.509
Sea slugs with legs and tendril
sticking out of them, and

42328e8e-b213-4453-a613-7224762d8ce3-1
00:41:21.509 --> 00:41:25.497
there's a large light that's
suddenly shining on it like a

42328e8e-b213-4453-a613-7224762d8ce3-2
00:41:25.497 --> 00:41:27.930
spotlight and all of a sudden
this.

dbe46db5-d3bf-4be5-b5db-dd27c0188889-0
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.390
Checkered submarine and it comes
out of nowhere and scoops up.

5e7036d7-23a6-4a31-8590-f340eb352f74-0
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.670
The paper boat and has it on the
tip of its nose basically as it

5e7036d7-23a6-4a31-8590-f340eb352f74-1
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:44.896
looks like it's heading upwards
with the light leading the way

5e7036d7-23a6-4a31-8590-f340eb352f74-2
00:41:44.896 --> 00:41:47.550
and then it gets to the surface.

d8fc3b32-9c30-4766-badf-8626df79dc7b-0
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:48.830
Umm.

e1744ce2-7cfd-4071-9ea7-bb75c75842fd-0
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.670
There's some little fish and.

211b9d68-ac61-49d2-a0af-237b4f0d8c7c-0
00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.560
The paper boat dumps out the
water that was in it.

0ba2ef99-f758-46b6-b6e3-38310cfa7e40-0
00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.090
And then we see a a smaller kind
of.

412f5924-8766-4bf0-8a3b-39de0e0953fd-0
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.682
Well, it looks like maybe a
wooden ship, but maybe it could

412f5924-8766-4bf0-8a3b-39de0e0953fd-1
00:42:05.682 --> 00:42:08.753
be made of metal. But it's small
and it looks like a small

412f5924-8766-4bf0-8a3b-39de0e0953fd-2
00:42:08.753 --> 00:42:11.823
fishing boat of sorts being
attacked by a giant squid, and

412f5924-8766-4bf0-8a3b-39de0e0953fd-3
00:42:11.823 --> 00:42:14.530
the paper boat just kind of
floats away from there.

d2652152-d231-465a-8704-ebd1e1c529be-0
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.615
So the paper boat continues on
it comes across some seal allows

d2652152-d231-465a-8704-ebd1e1c529be-1
00:42:22.615 --> 00:42:26.287
aren't sea lions, those are
seals. These are different.

d2652152-d231-465a-8704-ebd1e1c529be-2
00:42:26.287 --> 00:42:30.352
Comes across some seals and one
of the seals is balancing the

d2652152-d231-465a-8704-ebd1e1c529be-3
00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:31.859
paper boat on its nose.

82d9ef99-51e0-41c2-88ad-ccc31294e8c3-0
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.310
Um.

16b9cb23-2400-46ac-8c97-daa1814b2670-0
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.601
And we just kind of see like a
kelp forest of different

16b9cb23-2400-46ac-8c97-daa1814b2670-1
00:42:37.601 --> 00:42:41.000
creatures and more seals and
fish kind of coming out of it.

f6d1e536-a38a-4c5e-a619-a24ba5a2cab2-0
00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.268
And the boat continues on its
travels, so it's going over that

f6d1e536-a38a-4c5e-a619-a24ba5a2cab2-1
00:42:48.268 --> 00:42:49.180
kelp forest now.

e9c5e865-3b1b-4bd8-a6e4-7d9fa90861ed-0
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.800
There's like.

1c9f70dd-1ebc-41fa-be9d-a4b5eda143fa-0
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.160
A cuttlefish and.

717bc9e5-acf9-405d-afea-1ac10ed98da1-0
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.330
Some eels and some jellyfish.

44dd65fb-74e0-4acd-b83e-0b08e861c48f-0
00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.850
It's different rays and the
bunch of different creatures.

44dd65fb-74e0-4acd-b83e-0b08e861c48f-1
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:02.970
And then there's.

a33faa0b-a647-4917-bd98-d440409f6f8f-0
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.004
Some it looks like a human
wearing one of those old school

a33faa0b-a647-4917-bd98-d440409f6f8f-1
00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:13.717
scuba diving helmets, and it
looks like it has like an oyster

a33faa0b-a647-4917-bd98-d440409f6f8f-2
00:43:13.717 --> 00:43:18.430
propped open with a metal device
and it's stealing the Pearl.

b9663ee8-baa6-4746-9794-009a4000724b-0
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.040
From there.

85efd424-87a0-4524-a188-31a37d4b950b-0
00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.670
And the boat just keeps moving
on.

aa75a76e-4adb-4397-b91e-8b9ece084ec0-0
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.540
So now the boat kind of
approaches one of those larger

aa75a76e-4adb-4397-b91e-8b9ece084ec0-1
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.846
buoys that has a light on top of
it, and the bottom is red. The

aa75a76e-4adb-4397-b91e-8b9ece084ec0-2
00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:39.017
top is red, but the middle is
white, so it's striped, and the

aa75a76e-4adb-4397-b91e-8b9ece084ec0-3
00:43:39.017 --> 00:43:43.390
man who had stolen the Pearl is
riding some sort of creature and

aa75a76e-4adb-4397-b91e-8b9ece084ec0-4
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.140
has the Pearl in a basket.

c493425b-fd53-4c2e-9d6a-9a770bddc2f3-0
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.033
And it kind of floats past
there. And then it comes across

c493425b-fd53-4c2e-9d6a-9a770bddc2f3-1
00:43:50.033 --> 00:43:53.766
a lighthouse that is also
striped like a candy cane all

c493425b-fd53-4c2e-9d6a-9a770bddc2f3-2
00:43:53.766 --> 00:43:54.499
the way up.

41d73554-04c1-47b1-8c7e-55ba7313cbf4-0
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.394
And both of these lighted
objects have light bulbs that

41d73554-04c1-47b1-8c7e-55ba7313cbf4-1
00:43:58.394 --> 00:44:01.569
are similar to like Edison
bulbs. So they're old school

41d73554-04c1-47b1-8c7e-55ba7313cbf4-2
00:44:01.569 --> 00:44:02.250
light bulbs.

da44e4d3-bb84-4ac7-bb2c-503920defd83-0
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.990
And this lighthouse is on an
island that has like it looks

da44e4d3-bb84-4ac7-bb2c-503920defd83-1
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:11.039
like some bushes or rocks, hard
to tell. And there's a girl

da44e4d3-bb84-4ac7-bb2c-503920defd83-2
00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:15.020
standing on the island with
large ships in the background.

984ab403-c39c-401e-8946-40ace47e2643-0
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.441
So we're kind of coming across
what looks like more of human

984ab403-c39c-401e-8946-40ace47e2643-1
00:44:25.441 --> 00:44:30.215
structures and the boat is
floating under a long pier and

984ab403-c39c-401e-8946-40ace47e2643-2
00:44:30.215 --> 00:44:31.780
this pier jets out.

a964c0ea-72e9-4da4-88fd-fa19d40701f0-0
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.772
For a long time. And then it's
circular at the end, and it has

a964c0ea-72e9-4da4-88fd-fa19d40701f0-1
00:44:35.772 --> 00:44:38.577
a building on it that is
circular all the way around,

a964c0ea-72e9-4da4-88fd-fa19d40701f0-2
00:44:38.577 --> 00:44:41.538
that has like arched windows
around it and it comes to a

a964c0ea-72e9-4da4-88fd-fa19d40701f0-3
00:44:41.538 --> 00:44:41.850
point.

98096134-8ec8-4db0-8fd8-53c4399fb500-0
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.050
And there are ships.

cf9c7ba2-63ab-4fb4-a4a2-a15922c75f56-0
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:50.321
Sailed chips and motored ships
and we see the boat just kind of

cf9c7ba2-63ab-4fb4-a4a2-a15922c75f56-1
00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:55.137
floating past and there's still
fish in the water and some water

cf9c7ba2-63ab-4fb4-a4a2-a15922c75f56-2
00:44:55.137 --> 00:44:57.730
vegetation underneath the
surface.

949f05a1-3d46-4b46-8ae3-08cf9eabcfd7-0
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:05.806
So boat continues on. It's going
past a really large ship that

949f05a1-3d46-4b46-8ae3-08cf9eabcfd7-1
00:45:05.806 --> 00:45:07.090
kind of overshadows it.

2195c600-ed34-479a-9ea6-73305b84ea1d-0
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.910
There's a smaller ship behind
it.

0306ab5b-6ccf-4365-9e53-ee3a0f651bc5-0
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:15.367
And the break of the large ship
kind of creates a hump that the

0306ab5b-6ccf-4365-9e53-ee3a0f651bc5-1
00:45:15.367 --> 00:45:19.860
small paper boat has to go over,
and in the background we can

0306ab5b-6ccf-4365-9e53-ee3a0f651bc5-2
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.600
kind of see a cityscape.

b9595ac4-1ea1-40f7-b011-bde9640131c1-0
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:23.110
Of some sort.

e1125040-0089-4c92-992d-c25ac262da05-0
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.350
So the little boat keeps going
and we see.

3d9a51f1-e14f-445b-9788-51262e2289bb-0
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.560
That that whale from earlier and
it's wearing a suit that must

3d9a51f1-e14f-445b-9788-51262e2289bb-1
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.832
keep it wet because it has a
shower head at the top that's

3d9a51f1-e14f-445b-9788-51262e2289bb-2
00:45:42.832 --> 00:45:44.280
pouring water on it.

b3a62035-5b69-4584-9d8e-3ca42edf527c-0
00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:45.690
Um.

e8e70499-d4b1-4016-af2c-0fa0dd3a9bbd-0
00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.733
And we see a large ship and some
people in like a small like

e8e70499-d4b1-4016-af2c-0fa0dd3a9bbd-1
00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:54.190
dingy motorboat.

e5160f4f-bcd1-4823-9cfd-8a8b631ba7a3-0
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.026
There's like what looks like a
cherry picker that's going up

e5160f4f-bcd1-4823-9cfd-8a8b631ba7a3-1
00:45:59.026 --> 00:46:02.442
and talking to the whale, and
the paper boat just keeps kind

e5160f4f-bcd1-4823-9cfd-8a8b631ba7a3-2
00:46:02.442 --> 00:46:06.138
of moving its way along the edge
of the harbor. So there's like a

e5160f4f-bcd1-4823-9cfd-8a8b631ba7a3-3
00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:09.778
brick wall that's tall where the
water is down at the bottom and

e5160f4f-bcd1-4823-9cfd-8a8b631ba7a3-4
00:46:09.778 --> 00:46:12.410
there's a bunch of people
standing on the top.

df66b461-2ec4-4afa-836d-0037252bcb78-0
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.970
The boat continues to float on
and we see more.

45dc7164-20f8-46c1-b636-28218db44235-0
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:25.457
Ships. We see some people
working on a small wooden boat.

45dc7164-20f8-46c1-b636-28218db44235-1
00:46:25.457 --> 00:46:29.810
We see a bunch of cranes in the
background so it looks like an

45dc7164-20f8-46c1-b636-28218db44235-2
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:34.233
industrial area, and the little
paper boat keeps on moving. And

45dc7164-20f8-46c1-b636-28218db44235-3
00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:36.789
then we come across what looks
like.

7cf1c9ce-cf90-4dc2-8e98-298044304ad2-0
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:42.770
A suit of some sort or some sort
of ship. But at the top there's

7cf1c9ce-cf90-4dc2-8e98-298044304ad2-1
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:47.036
like a glass globe, and there
are two people inside of that

7cf1c9ce-cf90-4dc2-8e98-298044304ad2-2
00:46:47.036 --> 00:46:51.586
glass globe. And then there's a
wall made of brick, and there's

7cf1c9ce-cf90-4dc2-8e98-298044304ad2-3
00:46:51.586 --> 00:46:55.922
a stairwell at the bottom that
kind of leads into the water,

7cf1c9ce-cf90-4dc2-8e98-298044304ad2-4
00:46:55.922 --> 00:46:58.340
and at the top there's a
doorway.

581e7a96-7ee9-4677-bfac-ed0b729a025d-0
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.930
The boat keeps going and we see.

d02b3252-fbda-413c-9513-ff4d40b8e3d3-0
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:08.530
it comes up.

c24da5f7-1eb2-489b-993a-acf589e02b7f-0
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.859
To one boat, and it's kind of
like a human is looking at it,

c24da5f7-1eb2-489b-993a-acf589e02b7f-1
00:47:12.859 --> 00:47:16.708
and the human has in its net a
large sea creature, maybe two of

c24da5f7-1eb2-489b-993a-acf589e02b7f-2
00:47:16.708 --> 00:47:20.197
them. And if we see that, it
looks like the sea creatures

c24da5f7-1eb2-489b-993a-acf589e02b7f-3
00:47:20.197 --> 00:47:21.160
that had helped.

67a7831d-6cdf-453c-bef8-bb18a84d2ba9-0
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:26.368
The boat earlier it's the
narwhal alligator and the other

67a7831d-6cdf-453c-bef8-bb18a84d2ba9-1
00:47:26.368 --> 00:47:30.480
like alligator type thing that
has a saw for a face.

12a90b74-0b31-49f2-91da-82faac1ca779-0
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.210
And then it continues on and it
comes to another brick wall and

12a90b74-0b31-49f2-91da-82faac1ca779-1
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:40.153
at the bottom of the stairs of
this one there's a person. And

12a90b74-0b31-49f2-91da-82faac1ca779-2
00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:42.380
so the boat is kind of stopped
at.

8d016733-7458-4e9a-ad89-4cdd369c9997-0
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.060
This wall by this person.

8fc01ab6-c2ab-4464-b647-55e2e1ffd378-0
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.125
And then we kind of zoom out and
we get an idea for like the

8fc01ab6-c2ab-4464-b647-55e2e1ffd378-1
00:47:53.125 --> 00:47:55.900
whole city. So it's a city
that's a mixture of.

bf51203b-ea6c-47a1-b435-eb0ca91f03b8-0
00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.365
Um domed roofs and like cone
shaped roofs and then like a

bf51203b-ea6c-47a1-b435-eb0ca91f03b8-1
00:48:01.365 --> 00:48:04.860
couple normal sloped roofs and
pointed roofs.

3efba4db-a969-48e2-a18b-e161a62623fc-0
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:10.604
And then there are these bridges
that go over the waterway that

3efba4db-a969-48e2-a18b-e161a62623fc-1
00:48:10.604 --> 00:48:14.743
look like they're also housing
units and they're arched, so

3efba4db-a969-48e2-a18b-e161a62623fc-2
00:48:14.743 --> 00:48:17.710
they're not the most practical
and we see.

e6b93c46-364a-45bc-8f63-ebc39bd839a8-0
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.761
The creature in the air that we
had seen previously that was

e6b93c46-364a-45bc-8f63-ebc39bd839a8-1
00:48:22.761 --> 00:48:26.697
standing on the island with the
debris and it's using some sort

e6b93c46-364a-45bc-8f63-ebc39bd839a8-2
00:48:26.697 --> 00:48:27.190
of like.

f9d46c21-1843-4410-8670-b64fded1f7d5-0
00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:32.358
Propeller thing to kind of keep
it in the air. It's leaning off

f9d46c21-1843-4410-8670-b64fded1f7d5-1
00:48:32.358 --> 00:48:33.840
the building and we just see
the.

0e365bbf-248c-4b4f-b1bc-5d38997993e1-0
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.450
The paper boat kind of going
through the canal of the city.

ba4a2b11-fe98-4d3c-b2eb-82b84f96bed5-0
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:45.372
So continues on. There's a bunch
of creatures. There's the man in

ba4a2b11-fe98-4d3c-b2eb-82b84f96bed5-1
00:48:45.372 --> 00:48:45.650
the.

dea69f75-9ebe-492c-b528-cab84b6af210-0
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.827
Scuba suit and we see like the
conch shell ship again and we

dea69f75-9ebe-492c-b528-cab84b6af210-1
00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:53.530
see the character from the
beginning.

851e64b2-5e24-4894-a27e-ea90a8e2c078-0
00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.768
The dark character who's wearing
the cloak, riding a horse at the

851e64b2-5e24-4894-a27e-ea90a8e2c078-1
00:48:58.768 --> 00:49:02.757
top of the stairs and the boat
kind of continues out in the

851e64b2-5e24-4894-a27e-ea90a8e2c078-2
00:49:02.757 --> 00:49:04.420
alleyway or the waterway.

fb88dcc0-5004-4520-bb3e-0cbab4936071-0
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.690
Umm.

f7b6ea7d-8283-4534-a3f8-6ff6eb335536-0
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.920
Just kind of going past.

06f8e700-7eab-4813-a867-30899c98199c-0
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:11.608
The different creatures and it's
underneath all these art toys

06f8e700-7eab-4813-a867-30899c98199c-1
00:49:11.608 --> 00:49:12.780
that go over the waterway.

e2416c00-6542-49c0-a6e1-d974ef8a207f-0
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:15.690
It's.

6b2c8d5d-7a6a-4d46-9ca6-9471d1c0a0e9-0
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.074
So the boat keeps going, it's
night time, there's some fish

6b2c8d5d-7a6a-4d46-9ca6-9471d1c0a0e9-1
00:49:22.074 --> 00:49:25.848
looking on. It looks like it
goes past like a submarine and

6b2c8d5d-7a6a-4d46-9ca6-9471d1c0a0e9-2
00:49:25.848 --> 00:49:29.874
then a small fishing boat and it
looks like it's kind of coming

6b2c8d5d-7a6a-4d46-9ca6-9471d1c0a0e9-3
00:49:29.874 --> 00:49:34.026
to the edge of the city. So it's
more town like over here than it

6b2c8d5d-7a6a-4d46-9ca6-9471d1c0a0e9-4
00:49:34.026 --> 00:49:35.410
is deep city dwelling.

2160874c-99ea-4eac-a513-88ba278aaa1c-0
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.573
And the boat continues. So it's
definitely a little more open

2160874c-99ea-4eac-a513-88ba278aaa1c-1
00:49:43.573 --> 00:49:44.090
water now.

e05464cb-cb89-449a-8d84-9c81ffb4bd3d-0
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:50.385
And it's coming up to a small
house that's white, and it's got

e05464cb-cb89-449a-8d84-9c81ffb4bd3d-1
00:49:50.385 --> 00:49:51.540
like a small.

4a61533d-b228-4e66-bf6e-8a18e72a5de2-0
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.364
Street light outside of it, and
it's sitting on top of a brick

4a61533d-b228-4e66-bf6e-8a18e72a5de2-1
00:49:56.364 --> 00:49:59.640
wall made of brick, and the boat
kind of gets up to it.

9f9f708e-f68f-476a-953a-d62124fe1d01-0
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.250
And we see.

3f08f943-1a6e-44d4-9e50-d0e01a036ff6-0
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.692
A creature kind of appearing
from the boat. So at first it's

3f08f943-1a6e-44d4-9e50-d0e01a036ff6-1
00:50:07.692 --> 00:50:11.943
kind of translucent, you don't
see it fully, and then as it

3f08f943-1a6e-44d4-9e50-d0e01a036ff6-2
00:50:11.943 --> 00:50:14.140
exits the boat it becomes more.

3d987d04-18d4-4480-b8e0-be1953c1f5a2-0
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:20.608
Opaque and whole, but the more
that that the person becomes

3d987d04-18d4-4480-b8e0-be1953c1f5a2-1
00:50:20.608 --> 00:50:24.897
whole, the boat becomes less and
so they're kind of swapping

3d987d04-18d4-4480-b8e0-be1953c1f5a2-2
00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:27.780
where the the boat you could see
before.

6d0baf55-b37e-4c5b-85fe-1e511728ccd3-0
00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.784
So you can see the person and
now you can see the person, but

6d0baf55-b37e-4c5b-85fe-1e511728ccd3-1
00:50:32.784 --> 00:50:36.279
you can't see the boat. And the
person is now climbing to the

6d0baf55-b37e-4c5b-85fe-1e511728ccd3-2
00:50:36.279 --> 00:50:39.886
top of the stairs and there's a
pair of feet waiting at the top

6d0baf55-b37e-4c5b-85fe-1e511728ccd3-3
00:50:39.886 --> 00:50:43.494
of the stairs and the person is
in black and kind of looks like

6d0baf55-b37e-4c5b-85fe-1e511728ccd3-4
00:50:43.494 --> 00:50:45.579
it has like white markings all
over.

f5cbd9c7-9d23-4eb3-8e85-65934e7aaf2e-0
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.452
And then the person at the top
of the stairs is in white.

f5cbd9c7-9d23-4eb3-8e85-65934e7aaf2e-1
00:50:48.452 --> 00:50:48.930
#END_wanderer

82b44190-d004-4286-86b5-be3890136c43-0
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.990
Right. That was a really long
item. Let's take a break.

a7a4cc00-fc62-4b02-9068-6cbed19fdb93-0
00:50:55.350 --> 00:51:00.350
Drink some water. Yes, we'll
come back at 9:00 o'clock, OK.

1ab50268-04b6-4095-b62c-35325d3f552c-0
00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:11.531
OK, we're moving on to the next
item, which will be a complex

1ab50268-04b6-4095-b62c-35325d3f552c-1
00:51:11.531 --> 00:51:12.130
scene.

de165018-93bc-4697-92e3-cb232e157193-0
00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:17.320
Yeah.

241152f3-ace3-4ebf-86a3-5fd71317dee3-0
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.050
Just go for it. Whenever yes, go
for it. Describe it and.

8a8981ba-9780-45d3-857a-e8959afb9b1d-0
00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.020
Detail with what you see and
what is happening.

0a1e05c9-6114-44e6-982f-e9e72f74aaa8-0
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:36.529
#START_ancient_rome OK, so we
have a scene here that is what

0a1e05c9-6114-44e6-982f-e9e72f74aaa8-1
00:51:36.529 --> 00:51:38.660
looks like a circus ring.

3c2c35a2-c1ef-4bef-bb3c-fafdd2ac2847-0
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:45.185
So there's a large circular pit,
and the walls are made of white,

3c2c35a2-c1ef-4bef-bb3c-fafdd2ac2847-1
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:49.963
and they're decorated with a
pale pink decoration. So there's

3c2c35a2-c1ef-4bef-bb3c-fafdd2ac2847-2
00:51:49.963 --> 00:51:54.740
like kind of pink draping and
pink molding that surrounds it.

3c2c35a2-c1ef-4bef-bb3c-fafdd2ac2847-3
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.749
And then there's a white banner
that has pink on it as well over

3c2c35a2-c1ef-4bef-bb3c-fafdd2ac2847-4
00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:00.519
a doorway.

3b206c44-8793-484f-8b41-9418b50ff982-0
00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:07.032
And I take it back that this is
circus. This looks like like a

3b206c44-8793-484f-8b41-9418b50ff982-1
00:52:07.032 --> 00:52:11.801
lion ring or something like
where you would go for battle.

3b206c44-8793-484f-8b41-9418b50ff982-2
00:52:11.801 --> 00:52:17.054
So the there's a doorway in the
top right hand area of this deep

3b206c44-8793-484f-8b41-9418b50ff982-3
00:52:17.054 --> 00:52:22.308
circle and it's got like a gate
that comes down and so it's open

3b206c44-8793-484f-8b41-9418b50ff982-4
00:52:22.308 --> 00:52:27.320
and there's a lion coming out of
it. And so the, the floor of

3b206c44-8793-484f-8b41-9418b50ff982-5
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.229
this ring is made of sand and
then.

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-0
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.093
On the outskirts of the rain,
you can see that there's like

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-1
00:52:35.093 --> 00:52:39.202
stands for people to watch. And
so on the bottom there's a bunch

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-2
00:52:39.202 --> 00:52:43.122
of what looked like civilians in
a bunch of different clothes

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-3
00:52:43.122 --> 00:52:47.168
watching and cheering. And then
in the upper right there's what

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-4
00:52:47.168 --> 00:52:50.898
looks like some royalty and
maybe like a guard. And so you

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-5
00:52:50.898 --> 00:52:54.691
see a person sitting on like a
comfortable plush chair. And

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-6
00:52:54.691 --> 00:52:58.484
then there's guard in red, blue
and yellow with like golden

4458d001-7a7a-4b88-8f62-730f2fdc85fb-7
00:52:58.484 --> 00:53:00.950
helmets and red feathers
sticking out.

a1304b54-5a55-464d-acab-1c66d1ea137b-0
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.340
All around and then.

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-0
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.607
To the left of that, there's
more people in the stands. And

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-1
00:53:09.607 --> 00:53:14.014
then to even further left of
that, the stands are empty and

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-2
00:53:14.014 --> 00:53:18.348
kind of chaotic. And there's
like clothing items and shoes

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-3
00:53:18.348 --> 00:53:22.241
and pieces of things left
everywhere. Because at the

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-4
00:53:22.241 --> 00:53:26.869
bottom of the pit there's a pile
of lions and they had escaped

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-5
00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:31.203
and run up this area of the
crowd. And so you can see that

f0c0f9f8-97df-4bc7-9014-936ed65519c5-6
00:53:31.203 --> 00:53:35.170
there's some blood dripping down
from places and you.

dc2dfcad-571f-4529-b0e6-94ae731b14d5-0
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.594
Just see two lions kind of
running through the crowd over

dc2dfcad-571f-4529-b0e6-94ae731b14d5-1
00:53:38.594 --> 00:53:38.940
there.

f8a8aa77-c85c-4596-8617-032ff7881a49-0
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:47.183
In the pit you can see people as
well as lions and you see what

f8a8aa77-c85c-4596-8617-032ff7881a49-1
00:53:47.183 --> 00:53:53.220
look like either cheetahs or
Jaguar or some sort of leopard.

9bd92ebd-6f25-48dd-88aa-c5071c8c0458-0
00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.757
There are horses that are
pulling Chariots. There's a

9bd92ebd-6f25-48dd-88aa-c5071c8c0458-1
00:53:58.757 --> 00:54:00.320
couple tigers, maybe.

010c8a46-206e-406d-a051-52968943c701-0
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.652
And there are people uh wearing
different things, and so the

010c8a46-206e-406d-a051-52968943c701-1
00:54:04.652 --> 00:54:07.150
people inside the pits are
wearing mostly.

99d816ce-53a6-4945-a74b-1fe054f25277-0
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:12.974
Um, just bottoms. So we have
like brown bottoms, red bottoms,

99d816ce-53a6-4945-a74b-1fe054f25277-1
00:54:12.974 --> 00:54:16.890
but there isn't like a lot of
armor or anything.

537366ee-a866-4380-a3b8-b6a878fbcea1-0
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:21.100
And then some of them have long
like javelin Spears.

47fb27d8-e609-4710-b682-07a0bf2f338d-0
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:26.750
And there are Chariots all
around without.

c2b5bdef-7c0f-4228-adee-2b5a2ff515f5-0
00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.424
Rider. Well, there's one shirt
without a rider. There's one

c2b5bdef-7c0f-4228-adee-2b5a2ff515f5-1
00:54:31.424 --> 00:54:35.170
chariot that has a horse inside
the chariot, and for humans,

c2b5bdef-7c0f-4228-adee-2b5a2ff515f5-2
00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.890
pulling the chariot instead.

e481fdfe-21a6-4da7-8281-0eb5cbf9e5cc-0
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.839
There's a chariot that has the
rider and the four horses

e481fdfe-21a6-4da7-8281-0eb5cbf9e5cc-1
00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:42.650
pulling it.

bd0d6c06-445e-4305-b43b-3f5dba132af6-0
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.140
Um.

43730789-741a-4d68-a457-5b9d097f08fa-0
00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:48.180
And then, yeah, we just see kind
of a chaotic scene.

0121b9e5-2c1e-47d3-9598-d4776ea95460-0
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.923
People are fighting each other,
they're fighting the lions, and

0121b9e5-2c1e-47d3-9598-d4776ea95460-1
00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:57.958
we see a couple lions, like
mauling people. We see one lion

0121b9e5-2c1e-47d3-9598-d4776ea95460-2
00:54:57.958 --> 00:55:01.656
sitting with a knife, like
licking his lips as if he's

0121b9e5-2c1e-47d3-9598-d4776ea95460-3
00:55:01.656 --> 00:55:06.027
going to eat someone. And we do
see on the upper right hand area

0121b9e5-2c1e-47d3-9598-d4776ea95460-4
00:55:06.027 --> 00:55:10.264
of this ring some people trying
to escape, so they're standing

0121b9e5-2c1e-47d3-9598-d4776ea95460-5
00:55:10.264 --> 00:55:13.290
on each other's shoulders to try
to get out.

af0b0fa8-7853-4cec-bfa7-f5a0152d8f54-0
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.740
Um.

d6b3d215-1606-433f-90dc-64389fd574bf-0
00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.790
To the left of the doorway,
there's.

bf101eb3-0925-4102-ac0c-bfbca0720879-0
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.637
Like a rope hanging down and we
see some people at the very top

bf101eb3-0925-4102-ac0c-bfbca0720879-1
00:55:21.637 --> 00:55:23.930
of it who had managed to escape.
#END_ancient_rome

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.260
And yeah, that's it.

ad44d9c5-76d0-42df-9f5f-4ec35af2cdeb-0
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:29.430
OK.

Tell it as it is. Tell it as it
is. OK, I'm making no plot to

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-1
00:55:43.223 --> 00:55:47.655
the story because I forget what
I say in the last one. So every

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-2
00:55:47.655 --> 00:55:51.463
story to this story is
different. OK? #START_arrival_1

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-3
00:55:51.463 --> 00:55:55.687
OK, so here we are, starting
with the image of a family, and

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-4
00:55:55.687 --> 00:55:59.842
we have a man on the left, a
woman on the right, and then a

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-5
00:55:59.842 --> 00:56:04.204
small girl in the middle with
dark hair wearing a white dress,

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-6
00:56:04.204 --> 00:56:08.498
and it's sitting on the ledge of
something. And then we see a

172fd841-4df6-4e71-807d-f8f73ffc1ea3-7
00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:09.259
hand reach.

16f45bf5-38d4-4132-8ff4-d55d81cdcd71-0
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.130
And pick up this picture.

6d70be52-4da5-4bb9-a278-9a4444c83aa5-0
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.260
And it looks like they're
wrapping this picture up and a

6d70be52-4da5-4bb9-a278-9a4444c83aa5-1
00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.642
piece of cloth or some paper,
it's white, and then they tie it

6d70be52-4da5-4bb9-a278-9a4444c83aa5-2
00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:21.360
together with a piece of string.

d52e80fe-bcc2-472e-9f1a-5bf4ca663ab3-0
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:25.619
And put it inside of a suitcase.
And they strapped the suitcase

d52e80fe-bcc2-472e-9f1a-5bf4ca663ab3-1
00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:28.764
closed with a belt, like a
leather belt and a buckle, and

d52e80fe-bcc2-472e-9f1a-5bf4ca663ab3-2
00:56:28.764 --> 00:56:32.017
they kind of pressed their hands
on it like lovingly, as if

d52e80fe-bcc2-472e-9f1a-5bf4ca663ab3-3
00:56:32.017 --> 00:56:34.620
they're really wanting to keep
this image safe.

1601adb6-d688-4f97-b510-8d601ea25cd4-0
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:43.248
And then we see a folded paper
origami bird, an old school like

1601adb6-d688-4f97-b510-8d601ea25cd4-1
00:56:43.248 --> 00:56:48.936
clock that looks like it needs
to be wound so it's not battery

1601adb6-d688-4f97-b510-8d601ea25cd4-2
00:56:48.936 --> 00:56:54.263
or electricity powered and it's
got a curved top and Roman

1601adb6-d688-4f97-b510-8d601ea25cd4-3
00:56:54.263 --> 00:56:59.589
numeral numbers. We see a Black
Hat hanging on a hook and.

b8ada274-285c-44a4-9697-e80f314d327d-0
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.438
White piece of linen or
something hanging on the hook to

b8ada274-285c-44a4-9697-e80f314d327d-1
00:57:03.438 --> 00:57:04.320
the right of it.

c248a54a-e8dc-4de0-bf5a-c22d2289b356-0
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.949
We see an iron pot with the the
lid kind of off kilter tilted

c248a54a-e8dc-4de0-bf5a-c22d2289b356-1
00:57:09.949 --> 00:57:14.957
inside and a metal spoon used
for stirring, a big metal spoon.

c248a54a-e8dc-4de0-bf5a-c22d2289b356-2
00:57:14.957 --> 00:57:19.727
And then we see a drawing which
looks like a drawing of the

c248a54a-e8dc-4de0-bf5a-c22d2289b356-3
00:57:19.727 --> 00:57:22.510
family that we saw in the
picture.

d5bf2075-df0f-407a-bb7d-58028b885557-0
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.008
And then we had a tea kettle
that's steaming and it's white

d5bf2075-df0f-407a-bb7d-58028b885557-1
00:57:28.008 --> 00:57:32.091
and it looks like it's made of
ceramic of some sort. We have a

d5bf2075-df0f-407a-bb7d-58028b885557-2
00:57:32.091 --> 00:57:36.173
cup of tea that's got a slight
chip in it and then what looked

d5bf2075-df0f-407a-bb7d-58028b885557-3
00:57:36.173 --> 00:57:40.127
like maybe postcards on the
table. And then there is an open

d5bf2075-df0f-407a-bb7d-58028b885557-4
00:57:40.127 --> 00:57:44.209
suitcase with some folded items
and then we're kind of back at

d5bf2075-df0f-407a-bb7d-58028b885557-5
00:57:44.209 --> 00:57:45.830
the image of that family.

aa944720-15d5-4ca5-b2c3-d64efbbbce2c-0
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.989
And then on the right, we have
kind of all these things coming

aa944720-15d5-4ca5-b2c3-d64efbbbce2c-1
00:57:49.989 --> 00:57:53.232
together in a bigger picture.
And so those were the details.

aa944720-15d5-4ca5-b2c3-d64efbbbce2c-2
00:57:53.232 --> 00:57:56.582
And now we're kind of zooming
out into the big picture that we

aa944720-15d5-4ca5-b2c3-d64efbbbce2c-3
00:57:56.582 --> 00:57:59.931
see. It's a room and we're kind
of back to the packing of that

aa944720-15d5-4ca5-b2c3-d64efbbbce2c-4
00:57:59.931 --> 00:58:00.410
suitcase.

ef1514a6-a8d2-473c-8310-177222d1433c-0
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.398
And in the center of the room
are the man and the woman from

ef1514a6-a8d2-473c-8310-177222d1433c-1
00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:07.486
the picture standing over the
suitcase that was packed. And

ef1514a6-a8d2-473c-8310-177222d1433c-2
00:58:07.486 --> 00:58:10.882
the woman has her hand on top of
the man. So it seems like either

ef1514a6-a8d2-473c-8310-177222d1433c-3
00:58:10.882 --> 00:58:14.124
the man is leaving or the woman
is leaving, but we aren't sure

ef1514a6-a8d2-473c-8310-177222d1433c-4
00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:14.330
who.

0a7a04be-949f-4e68-af9d-8ef244da4d8e-0
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.829
And now we're at an image of the
little girl from the picture. So

0a7a04be-949f-4e68-af9d-8ef244da4d8e-1
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:25.707
she's in bed, sleeping with her
covers kind of pulled up to her

0a7a04be-949f-4e68-af9d-8ef244da4d8e-2
00:58:25.707 --> 00:58:26.010
chin.

49b08dd1-f4ea-49b1-a36a-23c246b6d61d-0
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.893
And the sun is just kind of
peeking through. She sits up and

49b08dd1-f4ea-49b1-a36a-23c246b6d61d-1
00:58:30.893 --> 00:58:35.103
rubs her eyes. She's downstairs
eating a bowl of something with

49b08dd1-f4ea-49b1-a36a-23c246b6d61d-2
00:58:35.103 --> 00:58:35.630
a spoon.

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-0
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.742
And she's sitting in a chair,
and she kind of looks to her

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-1
00:58:39.742 --> 00:58:43.346
left and she sees the suitcase
there. And then she sees her dad

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-2
00:58:43.346 --> 00:58:46.837
putting on her hat. Her mom is
putting on the white. He's the

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-3
00:58:46.837 --> 00:58:50.272
fabric, which we now know is
that headscarf. And then we see

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-4
00:58:50.272 --> 00:58:53.876
the little girl getting helped
to put her clothing on. So she's

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-5
00:58:53.876 --> 00:58:57.030
putting on some sort of head
covering, and it's getting

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-6
00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:00.690
buttoned up to her chin, putting
on boots. And then she picks up

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-7
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:04.294
the suitcase to hand it to her
dad. And there then walking down

a89cdd8a-97e5-44fb-a0d3-b5a345f32290-8
00:59:04.294 --> 00:59:07.109
a darker city street with the
doorway and stairs.

aeff7e01-dee4-4091-9269-14bc1366117a-0
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:11.853
And you see the shadow of a a
large like tentacle or tail that

aeff7e01-dee4-4091-9269-14bc1366117a-1
00:59:11.853 --> 00:59:13.630
kind of has some spikes.

14f8962e-729c-42d0-8251-4f2ac43ed55a-0
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.330
Sticking out of it.

d2187bdc-0d0c-4347-bb2a-b1ef7ba5b870-0
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.254
So they're walking. The little
girl looks up. She looks a

d2187bdc-0d0c-4347-bb2a-b1ef7ba5b870-1
00:59:21.254 --> 00:59:25.032
little scared. She looks down.
She's holding the hands of her

d2187bdc-0d0c-4347-bb2a-b1ef7ba5b870-2
00:59:25.032 --> 00:59:25.520
parents.

786957ca-29ce-4264-a124-2b0ae1eb0829-0
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.449
They're approaching a train
station, so the train is looks

786957ca-29ce-4264-a124-2b0ae1eb0829-1
00:59:30.449 --> 00:59:34.987
like a like a little, must be a
coal engine training. It's got

786957ca-29ce-4264-a124-2b0ae1eb0829-2
00:59:34.987 --> 00:59:39.308
black smoke coming out of it,
but it's an older model train

786957ca-29ce-4264-a124-2b0ae1eb0829-3
00:59:39.308 --> 00:59:43.414
and there is a woman wearing
like a white apron and some

786957ca-29ce-4264-a124-2b0ae1eb0829-4
00:59:43.414 --> 00:59:47.519
other folks dressed for travel.
There's like parcels and

786957ca-29ce-4264-a124-2b0ae1eb0829-5
00:59:47.519 --> 00:59:48.240
suitcases.

52065b65-1625-455e-8b7e-bf292ecba500-0
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.689
Scattered about, ready to board
the train, and you see the

52065b65-1625-455e-8b7e-bf292ecba500-1
00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:53.460
little girl.

02557ffd-5427-42b9-8a8f-1160cc217bef-0
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:57.463
With her dad's hand on her
shoulder as she's talking to her

02557ffd-5427-42b9-8a8f-1160cc217bef-1
00:59:57.463 --> 01:00:00.643
and he takes off his hat and
shows the little origami bird

02557ffd-5427-42b9-8a8f-1160cc217bef-2
01:00:00.643 --> 01:00:02.259
that had been on their mantle.

4283b188-0cb5-4bed-b89a-30b0fd5b03a3-0
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.270
So he gives it to her, she holds
it, and he gives her a big hug

4283b188-0cb5-4bed-b89a-30b0fd5b03a3-1
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:11.096
and she's looking at him. And
then the woman is crying, she's

4283b188-0cb5-4bed-b89a-30b0fd5b03a3-2
01:00:11.096 --> 01:00:14.985
wiping her tears, and then she
hugs her husband. He looks like

4283b188-0cb5-4bed-b89a-30b0fd5b03a3-3
01:00:14.985 --> 01:00:18.379
he says something to her, he's
kissing the side of her

4283b188-0cb5-4bed-b89a-30b0fd5b03a3-4
01:00:18.379 --> 01:00:21.774
forehead. And then we see now
that it's the dad who is

4283b188-0cb5-4bed-b89a-30b0fd5b03a3-5
01:00:21.774 --> 01:00:24.489
leaving, so he's hopping up onto
the train.

d64fdbfa-d5eb-4524-9829-e90ace4387ed-0
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:28.408
And he sticks his hand out and
holds on to his family as it

d64fdbfa-d5eb-4524-9829-e90ace4387ed-1
01:00:28.408 --> 01:00:31.322
departs. And then we see the
train getting smaller and

d64fdbfa-d5eb-4524-9829-e90ace4387ed-2
01:00:31.322 --> 01:00:33.600
smaller into the distance as it
goes away.

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-0
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:40.985
So now we see that the man is
traveling. He has the picture of

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-1
01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:44.780
his family up and he's eating a
bowl of something while looking

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-2
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.634
at his picture. And then we see
that he's actually on a ship and

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-3
01:00:48.634 --> 01:00:52.370
we're looking at him through the
side of a porthole window. So

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-4
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:56.105
it's circular and you can see
the bolts around the outside and

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-5
01:00:56.105 --> 01:01:00.019
it kind of zooms out and you see
that it's a large ship. It looks

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-6
01:01:00.019 --> 01:01:03.636
like the Titanic with it being
black on the bottom, white on

3ced0902-8af2-4e41-ad2d-37fc6c28f44f-7
01:01:03.636 --> 01:01:05.000
the top and some large.

254c55f6-5bd6-4350-8aff-486200db3d0d-0
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:09.608
Milk stacks. So he's traveling,
we assume, across an ocean or a

254c55f6-5bd6-4350-8aff-486200db3d0d-1
01:01:09.608 --> 01:01:13.580
sea or something, on something
so large. #END_arrival_1

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.340
OK.

cb874307-8842-4648-a1c0-fddd0425198e-0
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:21.679
So that was a part of the story
and we'll move on to the next

cb874307-8842-4648-a1c0-fddd0425198e-1
01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:22.080
item.

6cdd6482-7bcc-4347-b851-152719768f6a-0
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:26.120
OK.

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-0
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.921
So, oh, I remember this one, OK,
sort of. I don't remember. I was

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-1
01:01:32.921 --> 01:01:36.961
going with this story, but I
remember the pictures that

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-2
01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:41.434
they're cute. #START_arrival_5
So we are in a village that is

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-3
01:01:41.434 --> 01:01:45.835
on the border of a waterway of
some sort and there is like a

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-4
01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:50.236
long ramp that is lined with
different like row boats and we

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-5
01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:54.565
see a rowboat approaching this
ramp and the village is most

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-6
01:01:54.565 --> 01:01:58.533
significant for a large
structure that is in the shape

6deec98e-f1a1-40ed-869e-4b4bf59f059e-7
01:01:58.533 --> 01:01:58.750
of.

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-0
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.900
Like an owl. And there are
several other smaller kind of

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-1
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.338
bird owl like structures. And
then there are buildings. And I

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-2
01:02:07.338 --> 01:02:12.063
think I remember the last time I
said that it looks like the city

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-3
01:02:12.063 --> 01:02:16.573
from the movie Bruno. Yeah, I
thought is that no Luca from the

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-4
01:02:16.573 --> 01:02:21.083
movie Luca where like the little
seaside village and there's a

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-5
01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:25.592
bunch of birds in the air and so
we see them dock and we see a

f80a5369-8b4a-4a08-9e1c-1e0d91181602-6
01:02:25.592 --> 01:02:28.169
man tying the rope around a
little.

86bff077-877b-4a07-812c-83fc855f412c-0
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:30.690
Like figurine.

07b79b03-7193-4de0-88bf-1c6db0858437-0
01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:36.332
And a man in white kind of leads
the man in black off and they

07b79b03-7193-4de0-88bf-1c6db0858437-1
01:02:36.332 --> 01:02:41.359
start to head up the stairs with
a little boy. And so we see the

07b79b03-7193-4de0-88bf-1c6db0858437-2
01:02:41.359 --> 01:02:45.999
little axle idle slash, cat,
rat, whatever it is, creature,

07b79b03-7193-4de0-88bf-1c6db0858437-3
01:02:45.999 --> 01:02:49.479
and then a different creature
that is black.

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-0
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:54.045
Um, the boy is carrying a bowl
of something, and he approaches

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-1
01:02:54.045 --> 01:02:57.858
a woman and hands the woman this
bowl. And then the man in white

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-2
01:02:57.858 --> 01:03:01.436
approaches the woman and she
embraces him and he kisses her.

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-3
01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:05.308
So we assume that they know each
other. And then the man in Black

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-4
01:03:05.308 --> 01:03:08.651
gets introduced, so we assume
that he is kind of the new

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-5
01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:12.523
member. They shake hands and the
woman invites them in. She pours

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-6
01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:16.219
them a drink, and so they're all
drinking out of small cups, a

3a2614d1-1940-4293-8477-1050b39d581c-7
01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:19.680
small pore. So it looks like
it's an alcohol of some sort.

749b8949-7b05-42ed-b586-3815d61310a9-0
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:24.262
Or achieve. And then she starts
to take the items out of the

749b8949-7b05-42ed-b586-3815d61310a9-1
01:03:24.262 --> 01:03:27.562
basket. So they're different
creatures, not foods that are

749b8949-7b05-42ed-b586-3815d61310a9-2
01:03:27.562 --> 01:03:28.289
identifiable.

88139e0d-7212-4c48-a680-4d35348fd177-0
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.313
And at least not in my culture,
but she starts to cut them with

88139e0d-7212-4c48-a680-4d35348fd177-1
01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:37.395
a cleaver and is grading them
and it's beginning to prepare a

88139e0d-7212-4c48-a680-4d35348fd177-2
01:03:37.395 --> 01:03:41.345
meal. So she's using a cup and
like a pastry brush to paint

88139e0d-7212-4c48-a680-4d35348fd177-3
01:03:41.345 --> 01:03:44.900
some sort of marinade or butter
or something on them.

5735fa1c-9391-4038-85b5-aa0257f8a32d-0
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:53.078
And they're kind of sitting at a
table enjoying each other's

5735fa1c-9391-4038-85b5-aa0257f8a32d-1
01:03:53.078 --> 01:03:57.026
company, enjoying the meal. The
man is using a tool that has

5735fa1c-9391-4038-85b5-aa0257f8a32d-2
01:03:57.026 --> 01:03:57.350
like.

4699e976-2f8a-42d4-a9ff-88ac724763f2-0
01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.065
Fire coming out of the end to
like quick roast. One of the

4699e976-2f8a-42d4-a9ff-88ac724763f2-1
01:04:03.065 --> 01:04:07.130
items we see like a large
dumpling on the table and.

ef281f9a-c04d-4838-a371-71e6044bc7f7-0
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.764
Like a tentacle we see in the
center. There is what looks like

ef281f9a-c04d-4838-a371-71e6044bc7f7-1
01:04:12.764 --> 01:04:16.990
a bottle of wine or champagne
that's being kept cool, like an

ef281f9a-c04d-4838-a371-71e6044bc7f7-2
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.740
ice bucket.

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-0
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:22.076
Um, and the little boy is
sitting at the end of the table

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-1
01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:25.745
and he's giving scraps to the
two creatures, and the other

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-2
01:04:25.745 --> 01:04:29.227
creature looks like a fox a
little bit, but with a long

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-3
01:04:29.227 --> 01:04:33.083
tail. And so they're all just
laughing, enjoying each other's

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-4
01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:37.000
company. The man is telling a
story, the woman's laughing. The

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-5
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.856
other man is telling a story,
and then the man in white whips

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-6
01:04:40.856 --> 01:04:44.649
out like a concertina that has
kind of horns sticking out of

1560f9ba-e34e-4dd8-847a-4f276ee439d9-7
01:04:44.649 --> 01:04:47.510
it. So it's even more of a
hybrid instrument.

14ff29c6-cde6-4155-93ae-2d86e8c9b080-0
01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:52.836
Woman plays like a flute with a
horn on the end and the boy

14ff29c6-cde6-4155-93ae-2d86e8c9b080-1
01:04:52.836 --> 01:04:57.590
plays like a banjo mandolin and
and then the man in black takes

14ff29c6-cde6-4155-93ae-2d86e8c9b080-2
01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:01.750
out paper and starts to fold
origami and so he folds an

14ff29c6-cde6-4155-93ae-2d86e8c9b080-3
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:02.789
origami shape.

dc8dcbe9-f6d0-4751-848b-b5af3f97548a-0
01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:07.143
Of the like the fox like
creature and gives it to the

dc8dcbe9-f6d0-4751-848b-b5af3f97548a-1
01:05:07.143 --> 01:05:07.410
boy.

15706044-5345-46ba-b260-ae96d0e1f790-0
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:12.225
And then the man in white goes
into a cupboard and pulls out

15706044-5345-46ba-b260-ae96d0e1f790-1
01:05:12.225 --> 01:05:15.883
like a Terra cotta jar of
something, and he and his wife

15706044-5345-46ba-b260-ae96d0e1f790-2
01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:19.350
are holding in their hands and
they're presenting it.

fb8adffe-edd2-4984-a4e7-c2c7608afb74-0
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:22.330
Yeah.

f4940698-c746-4cd9-91ba-e1912ce5ffe5-0
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.010
Now we just seen the jar and
it's sitting.

97390700-cd7a-464c-8a2c-05d4a97ae2f0-0
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.320
Umm.

018283e6-df9e-4079-a2c3-2f852899b05c-0
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:35.949
Oh, OK, so we just see the jar
and it's sitting on a table and

018283e6-df9e-4079-a2c3-2f852899b05c-1
01:05:35.949 --> 01:05:37.340
we kind of zoom out.

9a1b42f0-f462-4d81-9f42-257e4dfbb2f9-0
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:42.807
And the man is waking up and
he's kind of rubbing his eyes.

9a1b42f0-f462-4d81-9f42-257e4dfbb2f9-1
01:05:42.807 --> 01:05:47.407
The day breaks, his Little
axolotl creature pops onto his

9a1b42f0-f462-4d81-9f42-257e4dfbb2f9-2
01:05:47.407 --> 01:05:52.640
lap and the man gives him a nice
pat on the head and he starts to

9a1b42f0-f462-4d81-9f42-257e4dfbb2f9-3
01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.319
get ready for the day. So he
buttons up his white collared

9a1b42f0-f462-4d81-9f42-257e4dfbb2f9-4
01:05:57.319 --> 01:06:02.394
shirt and he starts to cut open
some sort of fruit or item that

9a1b42f0-f462-4d81-9f42-257e4dfbb2f9-5
01:06:02.394 --> 01:06:06.280
has like the stem that looks
like a bell pepper.

36b93aa2-f8e9-4675-b416-b96a6af80f42-0
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.807
And then he's sitting at a
counter and has his food on the

36b93aa2-f8e9-4675-b416-b96a6af80f42-1
01:06:10.807 --> 01:06:14.873
plate with the knife on the side
and his sleeves are rolled up

36b93aa2-f8e9-4675-b416-b96a6af80f42-2
01:06:14.873 --> 01:06:18.810
and he gives a piece of food to
his little creature pet. And

36b93aa2-f8e9-4675-b416-b96a6af80f42-3
01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:22.940
then he starts to get ready for
the day. So he puts on his suit

36b93aa2-f8e9-4675-b416-b96a6af80f42-4
01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.006
coat and and his creature gives
him his hat and then they come

36b93aa2-f8e9-4675-b416-b96a6af80f42-5
01:06:27.006 --> 01:06:27.199
to.

07cf572a-b347-4aad-a9d7-2a497760e242-0
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.524
Like a town square and it is a
little like hazy outside and we

07cf572a-b347-4aad-a9d7-2a497760e242-1
01:06:33.524 --> 01:06:38.289
see people as silhouettes mostly
and so we're seeing them from

07cf572a-b347-4aad-a9d7-2a497760e242-2
01:06:38.289 --> 01:06:38.970
the back.

4e6350a4-5a43-402b-95bd-94ae17af01c9-0
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.749
And there are like banners and
like little creatures flying in

4e6350a4-5a43-402b-95bd-94ae17af01c9-1
01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:47.598
the air. And we see a lot of
these people have a companion

4e6350a4-5a43-402b-95bd-94ae17af01c9-2
01:06:47.598 --> 01:06:49.360
pet just like the man does.

d47052b2-afd5-422b-948c-de032f59abe2-0
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:54.810
We see some men working out what
looks like.

c580d1ba-1933-4399-a7cc-766383e29c23-0
01:06:55.530 --> 01:07:02.133
A power plant and we see a man
feeding some fish or birds from

c580d1ba-1933-4399-a7cc-766383e29c23-1
01:07:02.133 --> 01:07:03.810
a wicker basket.

83552ec0-54ed-4d8c-8a0c-013dbecc60fa-0
01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:07.320
We see a woman selling.

db52aa04-2658-4d25-9050-98fb6168f2ac-0
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.964
Some sort of items to two other
people, both of which are

db52aa04-2658-4d25-9050-98fb6168f2ac-1
01:07:11.964 --> 01:07:12.750
wearing hats.

7ea15eac-89e6-4151-8968-f1c91fc797a2-0
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:17.788
And we see a man who's working
on it looks like a tapestry or

7ea15eac-89e6-4151-8968-f1c91fc797a2-1
01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:21.310
ceramics, but he's putting
patterns onto something.

e5b300a4-f4fe-4b88-853a-45b6dec701a1-0
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.076
We have a man who's standing on
a walk tall wooden ladder who is

e5b300a4-f4fe-4b88-853a-45b6dec701a1-1
01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:31.277
using a paintbrush and painting
a design. And then we have a

e5b300a4-f4fe-4b88-853a-45b6dec701a1-2
01:07:31.277 --> 01:07:35.547
woman who is probably selling
items off of like a street cart

e5b300a4-f4fe-4b88-853a-45b6dec701a1-3
01:07:35.547 --> 01:07:39.816
and so it's got like 4 large
wooden wheels and it's kind of a

e5b300a4-f4fe-4b88-853a-45b6dec701a1-4
01:07:39.816 --> 01:07:40.229
wagon.

5ba9ed21-f9ff-41a0-8db9-98346ee55d62-0
01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.795
Of sorts. And then we see our
main man, who is wearing his

5ba9ed21-f9ff-41a0-8db9-98346ee55d62-1
01:07:44.795 --> 01:07:48.287
suit coat. He has this hat in
his hand and his little

5ba9ed21-f9ff-41a0-8db9-98346ee55d62-2
01:07:48.287 --> 01:07:52.426
creatures by his side, and they
approach a man who looks like a

5ba9ed21-f9ff-41a0-8db9-98346ee55d62-3
01:07:52.426 --> 01:07:52.750
chef.

11b76660-cecf-44e2-a413-e6c96e0c41a9-0
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:58.070
Who is holding a bowl and has a
spoon and he's got an apron on

11b76660-cecf-44e2-a413-e6c96e0c41a9-1
01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:02.601
and he's in mostly white with a
white pointy hat and then he

11b76660-cecf-44e2-a413-e6c96e0c41a9-2
01:08:02.601 --> 01:08:06.910
goes and talks to another man
who is working in a boiler.

bbcaee90-3bb1-46e9-bab4-fc2c392bf8ee-0
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:11.840
And the boiler man is wearing
glasses and has.

a4063efa-3357-4f9d-8659-3a26f9a15d75-0
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:17.506
Like an old school had on and
sleeves are rolled and he's got

a4063efa-3357-4f9d-8659-3a26f9a15d75-1
01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:21.498
a little creature companion and
that looks like an alligator

a4063efa-3357-4f9d-8659-3a26f9a15d75-2
01:08:21.498 --> 01:08:25.816
who's holding a wrench. And then
he goes and talks to a woman and

a4063efa-3357-4f9d-8659-3a26f9a15d75-3
01:08:25.816 --> 01:08:27.780
what looks like an apothecary.

bfc6f65a-e88b-45ed-9771-628b5426cb9b-0
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:33.300
And she has a shelf of a lot of
different items behind her. And

bfc6f65a-e88b-45ed-9771-628b5426cb9b-1
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.590
there are bowls on the counter
that have like.

42d81c27-104d-476f-a40d-f73e26342465-0
01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.582
Small creatures. We don't know
if the creatures are real or if

42d81c27-104d-476f-a40d-f73e26342465-1
01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:42.330
they're like.

554cb455-746a-46b1-9785-9e8207a6a311-0
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:45.250
Little figurines, but they're
having.

889f8379-4fb6-487c-86cc-9c408703ce82-0
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:49.550
A conversation. It's hard to
tell if they're agreeing on

889f8379-4fb6-487c-86cc-9c408703ce82-1
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:52.998
something or disagreeing because
the woman has her hands up at

889f8379-4fb6-487c-86cc-9c408703ce82-2
01:08:52.998 --> 01:08:56.392
the man, but then we see him
continue on to what looks like a

889f8379-4fb6-487c-86cc-9c408703ce82-3
01:08:56.392 --> 01:08:56.940
shipyard. 

be3cd285-831f-4710-b2d4-45f32ca81f15-0
01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:02.934
And there are lots of men
working around. See a large

be3cd285-831f-4710-b2d4-45f32ca81f15-1
01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:08.440
propeller in the sky, and some
men on some like cables and.

45d04432-0e50-4474-ac45-f7b7209b7579-0
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.067
More of those little creatures,
and then we see more of those

45d04432-0e50-4474-ac45-f7b7209b7579-1
01:09:12.067 --> 01:09:13.840
ships in the background.
#END_arrival_5

5f7fdc3c-23aa-44b6-9653-dc97e4272e6e-0
01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:17.240
OK.

01d764d5-0ed9-45b0-867a-a4a46e8f5bcc-0
01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:22.770
So we're gonna go on to the next
one, OK?

a7691c66-8c6a-46f8-a9ed-d1fb9408b56c-0
01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.937
And this is a complex scene.
Please take roughly between

a7691c66-8c6a-46f8-a9ed-d1fb9408b56c-1
01:09:27.937 --> 01:09:31.958
three and five minutes. I'll
keep track of the time and just

a7691c66-8c6a-46f8-a9ed-d1fb9408b56c-2
01:09:31.958 --> 01:09:33.870
please describe it in detail.

2691eb3d-c835-4fda-b568-bb9bca3b76fe-0
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.260
And whenever you're ready, you
can start.

60c92e28-a8e3-4cf3-bbaf-ded19d6371a7-0
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.464
#START_airport OK, so the
overall picture of this scene is

60c92e28-a8e3-4cf3-bbaf-ded19d6371a7-1
01:09:40.464 --> 01:09:42.040
like an airport and a tarmac.

3801aa1a-401d-43bc-806f-21d6bad31500-0
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:46.634
And we get to see at the very
bottom, it's like the inside of

3801aa1a-401d-43bc-806f-21d6bad31500-1
01:09:46.634 --> 01:09:49.190
the airport, so the different
terminals.

a63f8ba0-fea0-4fda-be36-b6995293eded-0
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.860
And then in the center of the
scene is the tarmac where planes

a63f8ba0-fea0-4fda-be36-b6995293eded-1
01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.921
are being loaded and then in the
upper left hand side is where

a63f8ba0-fea0-4fda-be36-b6995293eded-2
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:03.089
like the Control Center is.

c481ad3f-e447-4c9d-a8ff-6ed4fcdf27e1-0
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.550
And so in the bottom.

46cfacce-cad2-47ff-a4ac-8e8b4b8a5a9a-0
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:11.295
The the walls of this airport
are like a yellowish beige and

46cfacce-cad2-47ff-a4ac-8e8b4b8a5a9a-1
01:10:11.295 --> 01:10:14.540
the carpeting is like a pinkish,
and we see people.

a3c94c7a-8f50-42ac-a79f-2a12d7bdc141-0
01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.270
Of all sorts carrying luggage
waiting in line.

35dd1a43-7882-4b30-9841-86153947c8c0-0
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.650
Talking to some of the airline
officials who are wearing.

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-0
01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:28.117
um on the right hand side,
they're wearing red suit

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-1
01:10:28.117 --> 01:10:32.700
jackets. On the left, they look
more like police and are wearing

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-2
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:36.650
blue uniforms and are being
searched. And we see like a

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-3
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:40.810
conveyor belt on the left that's
in a circular motion with

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-4
01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:45.324
different items on it. We see a
man who is being stopped by one

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-5
01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:49.273
of the policemen and he's
opening his coat and it has a

90977547-140c-4e5a-b116-3244cb9cfbea-6
01:10:49.273 --> 01:10:52.870
bunch of knives in it. So TSA
did good work there.

a7715188-b53e-43df-acad-a19420114c9c-0
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.706
And then as we're kind of
approaching the middle area, we

a7715188-b53e-43df-acad-a19420114c9c-1
01:10:58.706 --> 01:11:00.130
see kind of a big.

58599bac-ca2e-4f83-b069-4cfa2176073c-0
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:05.226
Um, commercial airliner in the
center. That's kind of the main

58599bac-ca2e-4f83-b069-4cfa2176073c-1
01:11:05.226 --> 01:11:06.060
focal point.

fbcadc9b-1b55-4bcd-b151-a5ce6f5b791e-0
01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.392
There are people getting off the
airplane directly onto the

fbcadc9b-1b55-4bcd-b151-a5ce6f5b791e-1
01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:13.610
tarmac from like a stairwell
coming out of the side of the

fbcadc9b-1b55-4bcd-b151-a5ce6f5b791e-2
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:17.047
plane. And then there are people
who are working on the plane.

fbcadc9b-1b55-4bcd-b151-a5ce6f5b791e-3
01:11:17.047 --> 01:11:20.429
One is standing on the wing. We
have people at the bottom who

fbcadc9b-1b55-4bcd-b151-a5ce6f5b791e-4
01:11:20.429 --> 01:11:22.120
are getting luggage out of the.

ecc6e021-5277-4af9-8b15-2bd93608149c-0
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:26.337
A storage unit of the plane
using a ramp, and then they're

ecc6e021-5277-4af9-8b15-2bd93608149c-1
01:11:26.337 --> 01:11:27.770
throwing it on to one of those.

d46cd675-612a-4e3b-90c0-ce3476358e20-0
01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.870
And it's like a small.

2e3f06d7-271d-4159-91bc-08dee46be21f-0
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.433
It's run by like a little car,
but it's like a train, so it has

2e3f06d7-271d-4159-91bc-08dee46be21f-1
01:11:35.433 --> 01:11:39.072
like 5 units and they're
stacking luggage on there and

2e3f06d7-271d-4159-91bc-08dee46be21f-2
01:11:39.072 --> 01:11:42.380
then there's another person
who's on like a lift.

1e36ba12-5749-4f2c-b0e0-63f1823e2af2-0
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:48.440
Looks like he is unloading stuff
into the jet and then we see a

1e36ba12-5749-4f2c-b0e0-63f1823e2af2-1
01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.900
fuel chuck that a fuel truck
that is red.

d7db85ee-a351-4d4f-adc1-e8b329c211cc-0
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.700
And with a hose coming out of
it, we see another one of those

d7db85ee-a351-4d4f-adc1-e8b329c211cc-1
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:57.630
luggage trains.

5fb8b5fd-d641-448f-9763-1e2a08717fb8-0
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:03.477
On the left we see like a
transport bus that is blue with

5fb8b5fd-d641-448f-9763-1e2a08717fb8-1
01:12:03.477 --> 01:12:06.610
people getting on. We have a
green.

4b32adb9-0bc9-4788-b48d-77a13ab99368-0
01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.928
Truck of sorts, but I'm not sure
what it's supposed to be doing.

4b32adb9-0bc9-4788-b48d-77a13ab99368-1
01:12:10.928 --> 01:12:13.590
It looks like its hose got
disconnected and is leaking.

73f4fc11-9f23-4e42-a419-05133f648197-0
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.230
Um, and the far right. We see
another kind of commercial

73f4fc11-9f23-4e42-a419-05133f648197-1
01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:22.032
airliner that looks a little
smaller and we have people

73f4fc11-9f23-4e42-a419-05133f648197-2
01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:26.242
falling out of the door because
the stairwell is in the wrong

73f4fc11-9f23-4e42-a419-05133f648197-3
01:12:26.242 --> 01:12:26.650
place.

96a17731-d2a3-4c16-ae7f-b3e815f1093a-0
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.200
There's like a.

9f561b5d-1f87-44fc-bd3d-152d4f6ab195-0
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:32.850
Wooden biplane.

4233a6f6-5eb9-403d-8521-50bb4a61830b-0
01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.630
That has.

0f2c0396-0b4b-44da-ade3-2bc104e3c15f-0
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.860
Ace of Spades on the back of it.

61ad6748-57fd-4af9-b786-53fddd5a98d2-0
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:44.511
And what looks like like a bat
like Dracula hanging upside down

61ad6748-57fd-4af9-b786-53fddd5a98d2-1
01:12:44.511 --> 01:12:47.050
on the left hand side of the
wing.

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-0
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:52.710
And we see like a fire truck
putting out people with a hose.

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-1
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:57.233
And then on the far right we see
another jet with the nose of the

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-2
01:12:57.233 --> 01:13:01.345
jet open and there are two
people standing there. There are

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-3
01:13:01.345 --> 01:13:04.977
a couple more jets. One is
yellow, one that has blue

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-4
01:13:04.977 --> 01:13:09.294
stripes, one has mint green in
the background. You can see it.

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-5
01:13:09.294 --> 01:13:13.748
An airplane that's being loaded
up with some elephants. There is

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-6
01:13:13.748 --> 01:13:17.517
one helicopter, there is a, a
line of flags. We've got

225a9189-2735-4841-bd3b-f80afb4c482f-7
01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:18.819
Britain, we've got.

1685836f-490b-4414-aee1-0762ff382baf-0
01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:22.532
USA We've got France, we've got
Germany, we've got some flags on

1685836f-490b-4414-aee1-0762ff382baf-1
01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:25.691
the ground, and then we have a
hot air balloon, and then

1685836f-490b-4414-aee1-0762ff382baf-2
01:13:25.691 --> 01:13:29.016
there's a blimp in the sky, a
fighter jet in the sky, and a

1685836f-490b-4414-aee1-0762ff382baf-3
01:13:29.016 --> 01:13:32.341
couple more airplanes in the
sky. And then in the left hand

1685836f-490b-4414-aee1-0762ff382baf-4
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.060
sky there's a UFO. #END_airport

eed2cf5e-1c9d-4091-ae8e-c7ed23513d03-0
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.670
OK, that's good.

5ac263f3-1b54-4585-8f7f-73aa932b4518-0
01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:40.840
Next.

b9cd28bb-5134-49e8-95c4-a6cb29ea9d4b-0
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:46.345
It's another story, so just
describe what you see and what

b9cd28bb-5134-49e8-95c4-a6cb29ea9d4b-1
01:13:46.345 --> 01:13:47.340
is happening.

b4fbbe58-5c65-4cd4-adf3-99b51f5b74b0-0
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:57.867
#START_return OK, so this story
looks like it begins where we're

b4fbbe58-5c65-4cd4-adf3-99b51f5b74b0-1
01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:01.560
appearing into the side of an
apartment complex.

a284ebd5-c92b-4e7c-8de8-e5dfcf3adf59-0
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:06.460
It looks like it's all one unit,
so this is.

6f7593bc-7512-4f35-b7ed-b0f54f63d8d3-0
01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.180
Uh.

09dfbff5-773e-4c3a-9610-3c3c46ec2c35-0
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:13.208
Like a family's unit. And so in
the upper left hand room we

09dfbff5-773e-4c3a-9610-3c3c46ec2c35-1
01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:13.570
have.

29e65bd6-a331-4128-9d7c-6569c935468a-0
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:16.380
What I assume is the dad who is.

355e8376-2cbe-45d1-aac7-e1fa631551a4-0
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.909
He looks like he's maybe like an
architect or an artist or

355e8376-2cbe-45d1-aac7-e1fa631551a4-1
01:14:20.909 --> 01:14:24.569
something. He's at a drawing
board and he's sitting on a

355e8376-2cbe-45d1-aac7-e1fa631551a4-2
01:14:24.569 --> 01:14:28.679
rolling chair. There's a small
door in the room and a red kite.

355e8376-2cbe-45d1-aac7-e1fa631551a4-3
01:14:28.679 --> 01:14:32.789
And then in the middle area we
see a stairwell and just kind of

355e8376-2cbe-45d1-aac7-e1fa631551a4-4
01:14:32.789 --> 01:14:36.514
like a couch and a TV and a
sitting room. In the right we

355e8376-2cbe-45d1-aac7-e1fa631551a4-5
01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:36.900
see a.

3ecba477-80eb-4ebc-aa3e-be09e77e51af-0
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.966
I can't tell if it's a bedroom
or a bathroom. I think it's a

3ecba477-80eb-4ebc-aa3e-be09e77e51af-1
01:14:41.966 --> 01:14:44.030
bathroom, but there's like a
small little.

16c3f22e-b437-4c32-a9fd-5558ff4632e5-0
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:48.106
Maybe it's a bathtub with a cat
on it, and then on the right

16c3f22e-b437-4c32-a9fd-5558ff4632e5-1
01:14:48.106 --> 01:14:49.520
there's a a pedestal sink.

ca574f66-ad7e-4b47-884a-1e0d665647f4-0
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:54.367
And then the bottom right hand
we see a bedroom that has a

ca574f66-ad7e-4b47-884a-1e0d665647f4-1
01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:58.397
child in it who is drawing a
like an archway or a doorway on

ca574f66-ad7e-4b47-884a-1e0d665647f4-2
01:14:58.397 --> 01:15:02.625
the wall with a red marker. The
red is very vibrant compared to

ca574f66-ad7e-4b47-884a-1e0d665647f4-3
01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:06.258
the other colors. So it's one
thing to note, room is a

ca574f66-ad7e-4b47-884a-1e0d665647f4-4
01:15:06.258 --> 01:15:09.430
standard child, you know, like a
twin size bed.

aec91403-a619-422f-81da-e0fa0bb3cde4-0
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:14.387
And then in the middle, bottom
unit, we have the kitchen where

aec91403-a619-422f-81da-e0fa0bb3cde4-1
01:15:14.387 --> 01:15:18.510
we see, you know, bottom is
white with a stove and a little.

34825dc5-a7b0-42e6-baa4-06cd732b119f-0
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:23.275
A hood for ventilation, and then
there's some brown cabinets at

34825dc5-a7b0-42e6-baa4-06cd732b119f-1
01:15:23.275 --> 01:15:26.414
the top, and then the left is
kind of an entryway that has

34825dc5-a7b0-42e6-baa4-06cd732b119f-2
01:15:26.414 --> 01:15:29.820
like a little Tiffany lamp on a
small blue side table, a plant.

c3ed95d2-71ed-48d2-9ac6-9d1208abb26b-0
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:31.260
And then?

cb3e1068-528b-4941-99aa-ad1b1a9e0611-0
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.840
On the far left of the page, you
just kind of see the City

cb3e1068-528b-4941-99aa-ad1b1a9e0611-1
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.245
Street. And so we're kind of
going back to this child,

cb3e1068-528b-4941-99aa-ad1b1a9e0611-2
01:15:37.245 --> 01:15:39.956
there's a crown on their head
and they're, they're drawing on

cb3e1068-528b-4941-99aa-ad1b1a9e0611-3
01:15:39.956 --> 01:15:40.350
the wall.

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-0
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.471
OK, so that kite that was going
by the dad was the bright red

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-1
01:15:50.471 --> 01:15:54.189
that the girl was drawing with.
And so the dad turns around and

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-2
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:57.965
he sees the kite and he goes and
picks it up and he walks out of

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-3
01:15:57.965 --> 01:16:01.451
the room, leaving the kite
there. And then we see him enter

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-4
01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:05.227
the child's room, the as he gets
there, he sees the doorway that

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-5
01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:08.364
she drew has become a true
doorway, and it's open and

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-6
01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.965
there's some light shining out
of it. So he's kind of peering

7272f152-3961-47f9-a61f-2d9351e34c93-7
01:16:11.965 --> 01:16:12.139
in.

937d76e5-a54c-42c2-8a9d-3dc83e94eeca-0
01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.820
Bending over.

439377f6-18df-444a-9c3c-9d5293ee088c-0
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.054
So he enters to the doorway, and
it comes out of the base of a

439377f6-18df-444a-9c3c-9d5293ee088c-1
01:16:23.054 --> 01:16:26.970
large tree. So it's in the
bottom of the trunk of a tree,

439377f6-18df-444a-9c3c-9d5293ee088c-2
01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:30.887
and they're kind of in this
fantastical forest land where

439377f6-18df-444a-9c3c-9d5293ee088c-3
01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:32.169
there's these tall.

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-0
01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.362
Brilliant trees everywhere. And
then there's like Edison light

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-1
01:16:37.362 --> 01:16:41.807
bulbs, like porch lights hanging
from the trees, and then there's

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-2
01:16:41.807 --> 01:16:45.646
also some paper lanterns
hanging. And then it looks like

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-3
01:16:45.646 --> 01:16:49.619
little fireflies are kind of
glowing as well. So there's a

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-4
01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:53.727
lot of nice ambiance light. And
there's a small Creek with a

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-5
01:16:53.727 --> 01:16:57.970
little bit of a a dock and we
can see there's like a red ball,

52bd59eb-cb94-48c2-a847-734abe08711d-6
01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:01.540
the same red as the doorway on
the edge of the dock.

d8afab95-dc7a-4cb5-937d-61b496289e17-0
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:08.311
So the man goes over there and
he picks up the ball and he

d8afab95-dc7a-4cb5-937d-61b496289e17-1
01:17:08.311 --> 01:17:11.784
looks to his right and he sees a
large structure coming towards

d8afab95-dc7a-4cb5-937d-61b496289e17-2
01:17:11.784 --> 01:17:12.490
him and it's.

76c9cbbc-16a3-4356-b439-e0c58ad1b39f-0
01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.800
In the shape of like a little.

add45aa6-6886-4f1e-b011-f5c5a9f91a31-0
01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:19.150
Um, like a sea dragon, almost.
It's got.

fd02edc3-86c2-40c6-996b-63c1714ab290-0
01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:23.872
Green eyes and the front of it
is gold, and then it's flat in

fd02edc3-86c2-40c6-996b-63c1714ab290-1
01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:28.015
the middle, so it's floating on
the water like it's a boat. And

fd02edc3-86c2-40c6-996b-63c1714ab290-2
01:17:28.015 --> 01:17:32.092
then the back is purple for the
tail. And so it approaches the

fd02edc3-86c2-40c6-996b-63c1714ab290-3
01:17:32.092 --> 01:17:36.299
dad who's standing on the dock.
He hops on and then it starts to

fd02edc3-86c2-40c6-996b-63c1714ab290-4
01:17:36.299 --> 01:17:38.500
continue floating down the
river.

e4c34c54-7b42-4e8c-bebd-09a9a3213e4b-0
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:47.612
So the dad is riding it and he
comes to a large like castle,

e4c34c54-7b42-4e8c-bebd-09a9a3213e4b-1
01:17:47.612 --> 01:17:48.360
kind of.

993af06c-ac21-40de-8246-0169a3a2cbcf-0
01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.400
Structure there's.

d4429d4e-62a0-446d-928b-087274ef5460-0
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.010
Um, a big archway. There's like.

1b33dd73-1a70-422a-be8f-f086608647fd-0
01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.820
Circular or like.

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-0
01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:03.715
Cylindrical towers that have,
they're all made-up like brick

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-1
01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:07.734
and stone. There's big bridges
with archways. There's tall

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-2
01:18:07.734 --> 01:18:12.026
buildings that look like bells
would be in them. There's large

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-3
01:18:12.026 --> 01:18:16.249
domes that are coated in gold.
So it's you can tell that it's

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-4
01:18:16.249 --> 01:18:20.404
like a wealthy kind of castle.
And then there's flags at the

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-5
01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:24.832
tip of every building, and he's
approaching through the waterway

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-6
01:18:24.832 --> 01:18:29.056
and through a gate, and as he's
coming up to it, we see going

4d53f0eb-254b-44c7-a21f-772ac5bfd9db-7
01:18:29.056 --> 01:18:30.009
over a bridge.

9511b062-1b03-4093-82d1-378a01abde72-0
01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:32.920
Is the little girl in a small
red boat.

165cb051-bd39-4eb2-88ca-0071bec3c17e-0
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:37.700
Kind of heading towards the
right hand side of.

ad9057bf-4e54-4bc8-9a99-443aeebe3e45-0
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:42.003
This area, so it's not towards
the main city of this castle,

ad9057bf-4e54-4bc8-9a99-443aeebe3e45-1
01:18:42.003 --> 01:18:43.740
it's kind of off to the side.

a7506ef9-a03e-45fb-88c4-ce2814096416-0
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.210
So the dad catches up with the
girl.

710c93ed-a3a6-435d-9f9d-e62d1c4909f6-0
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:57.642
And he sees the girl's boat is
docked and she's heading up the

710c93ed-a3a6-435d-9f9d-e62d1c4909f6-1
01:18:57.642 --> 01:19:00.987
stairs. And so the dad heads up
the stairs and he's kind of

710c93ed-a3a6-435d-9f9d-e62d1c4909f6-2
01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:04.555
hopping out of the dock, chasing
after her, trying to catch up.

710c93ed-a3a6-435d-9f9d-e62d1c4909f6-3
01:19:04.555 --> 01:19:07.510
And we see now that there's a
little boy there, too.

09521e6b-6a31-4290-b44f-bd907d494191-0
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:12.620
And a small purple bird, and the
girl has a red crayon in her

09521e6b-6a31-4290-b44f-bd907d494191-1
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:16.368
hand. The boy has a purple
crayon and we see what looks

09521e6b-6a31-4290-b44f-bd907d494191-2
01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:17.440
like an emperor.

604923d3-9e48-45b2-a61a-dae7082aef5c-0
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:21.880
So it's a man in a long yellow
robe with.

6340477f-5d73-4c2d-8355-0406f5bfff9b-0
01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:28.509
A red kind of overlay and then a
white beard and then he's

6340477f-5d73-4c2d-8355-0406f5bfff9b-1
01:19:28.509 --> 01:19:33.278
wearing a gold crown. At the
bottom right of that scene we

6340477f-5d73-4c2d-8355-0406f5bfff9b-2
01:19:33.278 --> 01:19:38.370
see kind of two guards, or at
least Cafe Castle servicemen who

6340477f-5d73-4c2d-8355-0406f5bfff9b-3
01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.230
are both holding horns.

bb28dad3-35cc-431b-a116-202638dbc783-0
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:43.220
And so.

b0308014-f13c-472f-b2d6-0d725ccd7bd4-0
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.744
We see the little girl. She kind
of looks away from her dad like

b0308014-f13c-472f-b2d6-0d725ccd7bd4-1
01:19:48.744 --> 01:19:52.009
she's kind of mad that he's
there. And the dad is

b0308014-f13c-472f-b2d6-0d725ccd7bd4-2
01:19:52.009 --> 01:19:56.122
approaching the emperor, who we
now see is wearing a sash that

b0308014-f13c-472f-b2d6-0d725ccd7bd4-3
01:19:56.122 --> 01:20:00.301
has four colored crayons on him.
So he's got blue-green, yellow

b0308014-f13c-472f-b2d6-0d725ccd7bd4-4
01:20:00.301 --> 01:20:01.020
and orange.

fabfb19f-a475-4f2e-9089-ba5c9e83d732-0
01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.111
And the dad's kind of coming up
to him, so the little girl

fabfb19f-a475-4f2e-9089-ba5c9e83d732-1
01:20:05.111 --> 01:20:07.210
doesn't seem too happy that her
dad is there.

9a963237-a986-4b10-a504-898b47be3e11-0
01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:13.250
So then all of a sudden.

3b452749-7f37-4d21-ad47-73bb744b8ea8-0
01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:18.542
Some people come out of this
ship that the dad had been

3b452749-7f37-4d21-ad47-73bb744b8ea8-1
01:20:18.542 --> 01:20:19.200
riding on.

95c1fc37-18ca-482f-9561-223ad5ea8c89-0
01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.782
It's like a Trojan horse, and
there's like green backing to

95c1fc37-18ca-482f-9561-223ad5ea8c89-1
01:20:23.782 --> 01:20:27.350
it, so it it looks a little
sinister and they look like

95c1fc37-18ca-482f-9561-223ad5ea8c89-2
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:31.173
they're ready to fight. They
look like army men and they're

95c1fc37-18ca-482f-9561-223ad5ea8c89-3
01:20:31.173 --> 01:20:35.060
running up the stairs towards
the the boy, the girl, the dad

95c1fc37-18ca-482f-9561-223ad5ea8c89-4
01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.079
and the emperor.

eb7cd26a-bdad-4175-930e-e3454c58ce0a-0
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.366
Um, and so one of them kind of
pulls out what looks like a gun

eb7cd26a-bdad-4175-930e-e3454c58ce0a-1
01:20:40.366 --> 01:20:43.836
and is aiming it at the Emperor,
and the emperor holds up his

eb7cd26a-bdad-4175-930e-e3454c58ce0a-2
01:20:43.836 --> 01:20:44.620
orange crayon.

6867ea63-88ef-4a82-bed4-d06c567d5efc-0
01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:53.780
The emperor quickly swipes
Crayon.

3fb469c2-1aed-464a-b42f-b65bfe6798b1-0
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.843
Across from him and it turned
into a sword and he holds the

3fb469c2-1aed-464a-b42f-b65bfe6798b1-1
01:20:58.843 --> 01:21:02.983
sword up to the person we now
see is holding some sort of

3fb469c2-1aed-464a-b42f-b65bfe6798b1-2
01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:06.838
device that has like a crank
handle and almost like a

3fb469c2-1aed-464a-b42f-b65bfe6798b1-3
01:21:06.838 --> 01:21:07.410
suction.

bf74150a-0c57-434e-bd30-9d4b2805a207-0
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:13.315
Ending to it it's it almost
looks like a like a stage light,

bf74150a-0c57-434e-bd30-9d4b2805a207-1
01:21:13.315 --> 01:21:15.880
but it handheld and it's like.

13962756-7eec-4491-9512-e67c539e0e3a-0
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:20.379
And then this person too looks
like they're important because

13962756-7eec-4491-9512-e67c539e0e3a-1
01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:23.748
they're wearing like a large
golden helmet that is very

13962756-7eec-4491-9512-e67c539e0e3a-2
01:21:23.748 --> 01:21:24.170
ornate.

3c5a8e06-97e4-4b56-9a7d-a3ffa5b596d1-0
01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.220
And decorated on top anyways.

35fbab21-9902-4c6c-997c-9bcaf5076731-0
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:32.545
The Emperor draws the sword and
kind of holds the southern man

35fbab21-9902-4c6c-997c-9bcaf5076731-1
01:21:32.545 --> 01:21:35.970
at Sword Point and he kind of
backs away. But then all of a

35fbab21-9902-4c6c-997c-9bcaf5076731-2
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:39.623
sudden the man starts to crank
this device and it sucks all the

35fbab21-9902-4c6c-997c-9bcaf5076731-3
01:21:39.623 --> 01:21:41.050
crayons from the emperor.

fbd71a20-e38e-4bb4-9c3c-a15f6939cbe1-0
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:46.036
And then two guards take the
Emperor, and the man with the

fbd71a20-e38e-4bb4-9c3c-a15f6939cbe1-1
01:21:46.036 --> 01:21:47.280
device goes running.

320b0992-bf2d-4230-8dbf-63b0c4826763-0
01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:56.027
So he's chasing after the little
girl and the little boy. The

320b0992-bf2d-4230-8dbf-63b0c4826763-1
01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:59.812
little girl is holding the
purple bird, and the little boy

320b0992-bf2d-4230-8dbf-63b0c4826763-2
01:21:59.812 --> 01:22:03.725
is drawing something. And then
we see that the boy had drawn

320b0992-bf2d-4230-8dbf-63b0c4826763-3
01:22:03.725 --> 01:22:04.880
what looks like a.

6518ad08-bbdd-4be6-b7df-e73694de179c-0
01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:09.310
It's like a bird slash horse.

9fb8e558-2144-49c7-9764-17653123d72d-0
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:13.140
So it's got the face of a bird,
it's got the wings of a bird.

a041b3f7-5f83-4d69-99dc-8983c1f86c22-0
01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:17.125
But it has the body of a horse,
but it still has the talons of a

a041b3f7-5f83-4d69-99dc-8983c1f86c22-1
01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:17.380
bird.

adf77885-a9d3-4d8c-8891-6010f1101757-0
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:23.813
Maybe it's a lion, I can't tell.
The tail looks lion like so.

adf77885-a9d3-4d8c-8891-6010f1101757-1
01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:27.358
Maybe it's a bird slash lion,
but they hop on top of it and

adf77885-a9d3-4d8c-8891-6010f1101757-2
01:22:27.358 --> 01:22:31.021
it's purple and it's flying off
into the moonlight and we see

adf77885-a9d3-4d8c-8891-6010f1101757-3
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:34.625
the man with the device kind of
reaching out towards them as

adf77885-a9d3-4d8c-8891-6010f1101757-4
01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:38.406
they're getting away and we also
see like a small little island

adf77885-a9d3-4d8c-8891-6010f1101757-5
01:22:38.406 --> 01:22:39.470
in the background.

1db4231d-09e3-4223-a893-5b27e7427296-0
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.820
So they are flying.

408ae1cb-6baa-42b5-bbdc-ae54112c2a70-0
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:44.360
And.

7458554e-b789-4988-8ccc-f046a586c6a7-0
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:49.184
It looks like the ship that the
men had come on can also fly

7458554e-b789-4988-8ccc-f046a586c6a7-1
01:22:49.184 --> 01:22:53.163
because it is now chasing them
through the sky and the man is

7458554e-b789-4988-8ccc-f046a586c6a7-2
01:22:53.163 --> 01:22:57.270
using that little suction device
that he has to try to suck up.

2ca30b2f-74d2-4e2a-814e-478d311c60e2-0
01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.058
The the creature that the boy
had drawn, and as he's using it

2ca30b2f-74d2-4e2a-814e-478d311c60e2-1
01:23:02.058 --> 01:23:06.000
the the man manages to kind of
suck away the crayon. So we see

2ca30b2f-74d2-4e2a-814e-478d311c60e2-2
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.691
the boys purple crayon floating
through the air as they're

2ca30b2f-74d2-4e2a-814e-478d311c60e2-3
01:23:09.691 --> 01:23:13.070
trying to escape while still
riding on this creature.

6bdc1ac5-f9eb-40cd-b5f6-4258d5621397-0
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.970
So it sucks up.

ead5d058-2186-4a28-81f5-506fb693f224-0
01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.667
The creature completely, and we
start to see the boy, the girl

ead5d058-2186-4a28-81f5-506fb693f224-1
01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:29.830
and the dad fall, and the
emperor catches the boy.

175706d3-d640-4cbc-9243-1790adfd96d3-0
01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:34.547
And it's holding on to him off
the side of the ship that the

175706d3-d640-4cbc-9243-1790adfd96d3-1
01:23:34.547 --> 01:23:38.235
bad people are on. And the dad
and the girl are holding hands

175706d3-d640-4cbc-9243-1790adfd96d3-2
01:23:38.235 --> 01:23:41.625
as they fall. And the girl
starts to lose her crown, and

175706d3-d640-4cbc-9243-1790adfd96d3-3
01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:45.134
the dad is holding the hand,
which the girl is holding the

175706d3-d640-4cbc-9243-1790adfd96d3-4
01:23:45.134 --> 01:23:49.000
red crayon in. She still has the
purple bird under her left arm.

eb87228d-8230-4c20-82d2-82a494d31d14-0
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.100
So they fall and they land in
the water.

6189e993-24ea-4230-bdf4-99d88e4b94f5-0
01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.509
Probably hurt like cement when
they landed, but they apparently

6189e993-24ea-4230-bdf4-99d88e4b94f5-1
01:24:01.509 --> 01:24:05.210
lived and she starts to Draw
Something and it's shaped.

37205d05-7cc1-40d3-bb3a-a1b857b44291-0
01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:06.590
Umm.

dfeaad9d-5343-48fc-bbe3-019f9c17e8a9-0
01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:11.800
Take a long cylinder. It looks
like the end of like a pipette

dfeaad9d-5343-48fc-bbe3-019f9c17e8a9-1
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.890
but without the long tube part.

063fcf15-f67b-4838-adea-365811518a40-0
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.466
And so it's like the bulb end of
a pipette. And so she's drawing

063fcf15-f67b-4838-adea-365811518a40-1
01:24:18.466 --> 01:24:19.730
and they're inside of it.

75614515-4008-4edf-a4c8-42b8bdd8708c-0
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:26.372
So she draws this, and we see
that she ended up drawing a very

75614515-4008-4edf-a4c8-42b8bdd8708c-1
01:24:26.372 --> 01:24:28.692
interesting this girl's
talented. She drew a very

75614515-4008-4edf-a4c8-42b8bdd8708c-2
01:24:28.692 --> 01:24:29.620
intricate submarine.

393e0025-14e6-4827-8d4a-4cf01882bb6b-0
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:31.060
Umm.

8a04cfb0-8186-4ce8-94e7-e913ba6651fe-0
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:35.862
It's got several levels and so
the girl's in the top level

8a04cfb0-8186-4ce8-94e7-e913ba6651fe-1
01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:40.429
looking out of like the eye hole
to watch where they're going and

8a04cfb0-8186-4ce8-94e7-e913ba6651fe-2
01:24:40.429 --> 01:24:44.374
then the dad is in the bottom
level and it's got a large

8a04cfb0-8186-4ce8-94e7-e913ba6651fe-3
01:24:44.374 --> 01:24:48.664
propeller at the bottom and they
are approaching land and you

8a04cfb0-8186-4ce8-94e7-e913ba6651fe-4
01:24:48.664 --> 01:24:51.640
just kind of see like coral and
different.

d6c56edc-ccd3-46dd-b659-6da57a8ea222-0
01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:55.929
Plants and like sand structures
as they're making their way

d6c56edc-ccd3-46dd-b659-6da57a8ea222-1
01:24:55.929 --> 01:24:58.300
through the water in this red
submarine.

0478ae96-eddc-4d5c-b409-e3d355be4f89-0
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:06.329
So they come to a cave and they
kind of pull their submarine up

0478ae96-eddc-4d5c-b409-e3d355be4f89-1
01:25:06.329 --> 01:25:10.235
and park it on the left hand
side. They climb out and The

0478ae96-eddc-4d5c-b409-e3d355be4f89-2
01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:14.343
Cave has what looks like cave
paintings inside of it. And so

0478ae96-eddc-4d5c-b409-e3d355be4f89-3
01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:18.585
we see they're all in white and
it's hard to make out what the

0478ae96-eddc-4d5c-b409-e3d355be4f89-4
01:25:18.585 --> 01:25:22.760
pictures are saying, but the the
girl and the dad are kind of

0478ae96-eddc-4d5c-b409-e3d355be4f89-5
01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.040
looking up at them.

0a6a2151-aaab-43db-a0bb-828ac127c61c-0
01:25:25.770 --> 01:25:26.250
Yeah.

3ea1c033-60df-49ab-8100-8880fb63a313-0
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:36.933
So the girl notices one picture,
and so she runs over and points

3ea1c033-60df-49ab-8100-8880fb63a313-1
01:25:36.933 --> 01:25:41.916
to her dad and it looks like
what's going on to them. So that

3ea1c033-60df-49ab-8100-8880fb63a313-2
01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:46.658
The Cave painting depicts a
person holding what looks like

3ea1c033-60df-49ab-8100-8880fb63a313-3
01:25:46.658 --> 01:25:50.837
the sucking device and it
depicts them stealing the

3ea1c033-60df-49ab-8100-8880fb63a313-4
01:25:50.837 --> 01:25:51.480
crayons.

991d4692-1022-4ac7-bb00-97cff5d4fa8a-0
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.310
So it's showing that maybe this
has happened before.

b60fde9a-ca35-4da7-b441-8c9e7a4d7120-0
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.286
Now the dad is kind of looking
at the remainder of the pictures

b60fde9a-ca35-4da7-b441-8c9e7a4d7120-1
01:26:09.286 --> 01:26:13.092
to see what else has Like maybe
it'll tell you what you need to

b60fde9a-ca35-4da7-b441-8c9e7a4d7120-2
01:26:13.092 --> 01:26:16.601
do to get them back, or who
knows. So it kind of shows the

b60fde9a-ca35-4da7-b441-8c9e7a4d7120-3
01:26:16.601 --> 01:26:20.170
image of a person inside of
something, and it does show the

b60fde9a-ca35-4da7-b441-8c9e7a4d7120-4
01:26:20.170 --> 01:26:21.300
little purple bird.

5ffe62d2-949d-4776-804c-2bd6bed1f956-0
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.380
Doing some sort of part and so
the dad.

a0f85960-51be-40d9-ae6a-63be39b0f5fd-0
01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:27.370
Grabs.

a9a99dfb-f8b3-40c4-82fc-c7b21aefa9b0-0
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:30.000
I guess the dad has a.

0afbf5c5-e290-482d-b43c-9f8dde37c386-0
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:34.290
One of the crayons he looks like
he has the black one and he

0afbf5c5-e290-482d-b43c-9f8dde37c386-1
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:37.449
points out to the bird and he
starts to draw a rectangle

0afbf5c5-e290-482d-b43c-9f8dde37c386-2
01:26:37.449 --> 01:26:41.107
around it and then like a little
bird swing that the bird can sit

0afbf5c5-e290-482d-b43c-9f8dde37c386-3
01:26:41.107 --> 01:26:44.654
on. So the bird is sitting on it
and the little girl looks very

0afbf5c5-e290-482d-b43c-9f8dde37c386-4
01:26:44.654 --> 01:26:46.760
confused as to what her dad is
doing.

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-0
01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.845
We see that the the bad people
have kind of made it to their

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-1
01:26:54.845 --> 01:26:59.348
cavern, and the bird is sitting
on its little swing. And the man

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-2
01:26:59.348 --> 01:27:03.781
with the sucking device runs up
and tries to suck the bird with

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-3
01:27:03.781 --> 01:27:07.868
it. And as he runs up um we
realized that it's more like a

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-4
01:27:07.868 --> 01:27:12.301
trap. And so he he runs into it,
the bird flies, it gets sucked

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-5
01:27:12.301 --> 01:27:16.804
in. But as the man gets into the
center, the the sides that used

73157d40-6ffc-4596-b91f-18991341846a-6
01:27:16.804 --> 01:27:21.030
to be the ramp fold up and close
in, and so now it's a cage.

bf792e17-e80f-401b-8bda-709c2ca933b1-0
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:25.207
And that he is stuck inside and
the dad and the girl have the

bf792e17-e80f-401b-8bda-709c2ca933b1-1
01:27:25.207 --> 01:27:29.250
sucking device in their hands
with the man stuck in this cage.

14337d65-24a3-4836-a81f-8f9bae42292e-0
01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:37.309
So the dad goes and smashes the
stacking device on the ground

14337d65-24a3-4836-a81f-8f9bae42292e-1
01:27:37.309 --> 01:27:41.336
and a bunch of colors come
shooting out like strips of

14337d65-24a3-4836-a81f-8f9bae42292e-2
01:27:41.336 --> 01:27:45.216
rainbow, and we see the
creatures that had been made

14337d65-24a3-4836-a81f-8f9bae42292e-3
01:27:45.216 --> 01:27:49.902
kind of fly out and there's like
a a big kind of white burst of

14337d65-24a3-4836-a81f-8f9bae42292e-4
01:27:49.902 --> 01:27:51.660
light and it looks like.

70bfdbf5-da47-4052-8749-66943a53c2b3-0
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:56.274
Like all different color
butterflies and things. And the

70bfdbf5-da47-4052-8749-66943a53c2b3-1
01:27:56.274 --> 01:27:59.276
Emperor and the boy are running
and kind of standing back in

70bfdbf5-da47-4052-8749-66943a53c2b3-2
01:27:59.276 --> 01:28:02.277
awe. And then the two other
guards are on the ship just kind

70bfdbf5-da47-4052-8749-66943a53c2b3-3
01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:03.360
of looking like ahhhh.

2a256643-4905-462e-bcdd-2a8b5df84cc9-0
01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:13.150
So the guards drive off on their
little.

b102a7d8-5eeb-40c5-bae1-fa1c48d92321-0
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:17.040
boat and all the colourful
creatures kind of.

243ddf4f-b395-4abc-be4f-77c5159e0ec2-0
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.805
Follow them while carrying the
main guy with the sucking device

243ddf4f-b395-4abc-be4f-77c5159e0ec2-1
01:28:22.805 --> 01:28:24.600
who no longer has it in.

86be4001-8e6a-4838-9392-a7189c59f051-0
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.220
The cage.

af1abd08-ce42-4936-b8ea-d870f85e4dfc-0
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.419
And so on the next page, we see
the Emperor and the boy standing

af1abd08-ce42-4936-b8ea-d870f85e4dfc-1
01:28:31.419 --> 01:28:35.359
together, and then the girl and
the dad hugging while they're at

af1abd08-ce42-4936-b8ea-d870f85e4dfc-2
01:28:35.359 --> 01:28:39.056
a doorway that has the tail of
the red kite kind of sticking

af1abd08-ce42-4936-b8ea-d870f85e4dfc-3
01:28:39.056 --> 01:28:42.389
out of it. And it's a small
doorway, like in Coraline.

9776fbc4-1cf7-4e9b-8bfe-6b002147ef48-0
01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.640
and so they crawl out.

58688ecd-4200-4170-a4c0-f928f4f2e18e-0
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:53.562
And we realize that the small
door that they crawled out of is

58688ecd-4200-4170-a4c0-f928f4f2e18e-1
01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:56.271
the doorway that I mentioned in
the beginning, that is in the

58688ecd-4200-4170-a4c0-f928f4f2e18e-2
01:28:56.271 --> 01:28:56.840
dad's office.

a75f8c8a-b1f1-4b02-a815-3d626db904af-0
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:00.809
And so they're back home now in
their apartment, and it looks

a75f8c8a-b1f1-4b02-a815-3d626db904af-1
01:29:00.809 --> 01:29:03.510
like they went outside to fly
the kite. #END_return

7aea649f-a33c-46e6-be25-908cc721d7a2-0
01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:06.480
All right. That's good.

5313586f-5d47-47cf-9563-ac5af314564b-0
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:08.470
OK.

2b1acd33-a7b8-4369-9805-4d8a1722d60f-0
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:12.540
You can go on do a few more, OK.

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-0
01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.087
The next one is a complex scene.
So again, describe it as

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-1
01:29:18.087 --> 01:29:22.906
thoroughly as you can, but take
between three and five minutes.

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-2
01:29:22.906 --> 01:29:25.767
Whenever you're ready, you can
start.

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-3
01:29:25.767 --> 01:29:30.435
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
so here we have the scene of a

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-4
01:29:30.435 --> 01:29:35.254
zoo. So we've got some different
animal enclosures in the upper

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-5
01:29:35.254 --> 01:29:39.922
right hand corner and there are
some like gorillas sitting on

62daa5aa-da4c-4a9e-a310-2ac84a595863-6
01:29:39.922 --> 01:29:43.009
like some rocks and some grass
and then.

150dad8b-9e0e-43eb-a2f2-b1088bcf2726-0
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.445
On the right hand side, below
that, we have a giraffe

150dad8b-9e0e-43eb-a2f2-b1088bcf2726-1
01:29:47.445 --> 01:29:50.330
enclosure with some antelope and
an anteater.

408d191d-59b2-4ad7-98fa-f5ef89961d3d-0
01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:55.648
And then in the below that we
have a walkway with people

408d191d-59b2-4ad7-98fa-f5ef89961d3d-1
01:29:55.648 --> 01:30:00.222
running on it because a rhino
escaped and so that rhino is

408d191d-59b2-4ad7-98fa-f5ef89961d3d-2
01:30:00.222 --> 01:30:01.230
chasing them.

6a2ed94f-dd2e-4c36-a9b0-2882205f5889-0
01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.371
To the left of where the
gorillas are sitting, we have

6a2ed94f-dd2e-4c36-a9b0-2882205f5889-1
01:30:05.371 --> 01:30:06.580
like a cafe and a shop.

e6697d1c-9133-46fe-a44c-098c4006cab8-0
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:10.813
And there are people there. And
then kind of just outside that,

e6697d1c-9133-46fe-a44c-098c4006cab8-1
01:30:10.813 --> 01:30:14.317
there's like a little ice cream
stand that's in the shape of an

e6697d1c-9133-46fe-a44c-098c4006cab8-2
01:30:14.317 --> 01:30:16.890
ice cream cone. So it's pink on
top and it is.

b661f6c7-cdd0-4ffb-91f6-81fcb294e7ad-0
01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.078
Beige on the bottom to look like
a cone, and there's a man

b661f6c7-cdd0-4ffb-91f6-81fcb294e7ad-1
01:30:21.078 --> 01:30:23.940
serving ice cream out of it, and
there's a kid getting ice cream.

6ea689cc-dc40-449b-8878-8fc1fc15c26c-0
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:28.471
And we see that there are
walkways all over and another

6ea689cc-dc40-449b-8878-8fc1fc15c26c-1
01:30:28.471 --> 01:30:32.414
animal has escaped in the upper
walkway, behind the ice cream

6ea689cc-dc40-449b-8878-8fc1fc15c26c-2
01:30:32.414 --> 01:30:36.357
cone there's a kangaroo. Kind of
on the walkway there, to the

6ea689cc-dc40-449b-8878-8fc1fc15c26c-3
01:30:36.357 --> 01:30:39.982
left of where the cafe is,
there's an enclosure that has

6ea689cc-dc40-449b-8878-8fc1fc15c26c-4
01:30:39.982 --> 01:30:41.889
elephants and ostriches in it.

9a0c9a26-9548-48ac-8c2f-bce7cb940018-0
01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:47.140
And to the left of that there is
a polar bear enclosure. So we've

9a0c9a26-9548-48ac-8c2f-bce7cb940018-1
01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:50.630
got polar bears in the water and
then some sitting on some rocks.

b7ae6a64-9113-4816-b51e-35e1e503c050-0
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:56.253
Um, and then in the center of
the page and kind of area there

b7ae6a64-9113-4816-b51e-35e1e503c050-1
01:30:56.253 --> 01:31:00.960
is an icy enclosure, but we
don't see any animals in there.

576840c9-c96c-420e-b665-f0e6e4616eb0-0
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.056
But it's kind of structured like
an iceberg with little holes in

576840c9-c96c-420e-b665-f0e6e4616eb0-1
01:31:06.056 --> 01:31:07.670
it for the animals to go into.

ef5106a5-06bf-46bf-8bf9-8a5686a209aa-0
01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:13.552
Um and then on the left hand
side we have an enclosure that

ef5106a5-06bf-46bf-8bf9-8a5686a209aa-1
01:31:13.552 --> 01:31:17.862
has two zebras and like a
Pelican and some flamingos and a

ef5106a5-06bf-46bf-8bf9-8a5686a209aa-2
01:31:17.862 --> 01:31:19.250
hippo in the water.

028b3105-3aca-450f-b2f8-540640aa762e-0
01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.389
And then we have more people in
a walkway. We see a Peacock is

028b3105-3aca-450f-b2f8-540640aa762e-1
01:31:24.389 --> 01:31:25.230
in the walkway.

3c7de9c2-6969-4401-b674-14fd89c24db8-0
01:31:26.770 --> 01:31:29.552
with Its feathers out and a
person is taking a picture of it

3c7de9c2-6969-4401-b674-14fd89c24db8-1
01:31:29.552 --> 01:31:32.471
and through the feathers there's
a Penguin kind of sticking its

3c7de9c2-6969-4401-b674-14fd89c24db8-2
01:31:32.471 --> 01:31:32.700
head.

5c6aaa6d-54a2-43e2-9373-c4da12fa4a1a-0
01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:36.045
I'm starting to realize there's
kind of Penguins hidden

5c6aaa6d-54a2-43e2-9373-c4da12fa4a1a-1
01:31:36.045 --> 01:31:38.965
throughout the whole image, so I
assume that the Penguins were

5c6aaa6d-54a2-43e2-9373-c4da12fa4a1a-2
01:31:38.965 --> 01:31:40.310
supposed to be in the middle.

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-0
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:45.518
Enclosure, and they must have
escaped. And then in the bottom

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-1
01:31:45.518 --> 01:31:49.937
enclosure there are lions and
like a Prairie dog. And it looks

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-2
01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:54.286
like some people fell into the
lion enclosure while trying to

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-3
01:31:54.286 --> 01:31:58.214
escape the rhino that was
running. And so the lions are

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-4
01:31:58.214 --> 01:32:02.493
what the the female lion is
looking at them like, Oh no. And

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-5
01:32:02.493 --> 01:32:06.701
the male lion is licking his
chops thinking that he's got a

1135bf8b-4454-4f15-aa4c-069d315d2383-6
01:32:06.701 --> 01:32:10.840
free meal. And and then one
other item in this picture is.

3a008394-a3f2-4c77-b2f6-606d5d647e6e-0
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:14.646
We have a gentleman just outside
of the giraffe enclosure who is

3a008394-a3f2-4c77-b2f6-606d5d647e6e-1
01:32:14.646 --> 01:32:18.210
serving hot dogs from the hot
dog stand with a red and yellow

3a008394-a3f2-4c77-b2f6-606d5d647e6e-2
01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:20.280
umbrella.
#END_escape_from_the_zoo 

b457487b-b4cd-42e7-8e26-c04ae5f49863-0
01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:22.860
OK.

a79a42d4-1e25-4c8a-8649-dbe456b7d019-0
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:28.010
All right. Moving on.

4bd3e5b8-20ca-4ae1-a084-48352c98f752-0
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:32.670
Books.

a51a7490-71ca-430e-9324-56df197abae9-0
01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.950
#START_wild_west OK, so this is.

2271ad92-2e46-4022-9cb7-6ca9686df2ba-0
01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:45.045
What looks like I don't... like
the wild Wild West is what this

2271ad92-2e46-4022-9cb7-6ca9686df2ba-1
01:32:45.045 --> 01:32:45.790
is titled.

e2e779d3-d295-42ea-9a6a-8ad0a8c41b5f-0
01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:50.766
And and there are a bunch of
buildings, and it's all very

e2e779d3-d295-42ea-9a6a-8ad0a8c41b5f-1
01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:53.990
brightly colored and very
closely packed together.

2566a508-c621-47e2-9272-884e6f31d9f0-0
01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:00.544
And so on the bottom left, we
have a jail and it's made out of

2566a508-c621-47e2-9272-884e6f31d9f0-1
01:33:00.544 --> 01:33:05.729
like white stone and we see some
wanted posters on the side and

2566a508-c621-47e2-9272-884e6f31d9f0-2
01:33:05.729 --> 01:33:10.348
there's a bunch of people kind
of outside the jail, like

2566a508-c621-47e2-9272-884e6f31d9f0-3
01:33:10.348 --> 01:33:13.670
Cowboys leaning up against the
building.

24995741-291c-4b38-836a-85616c2a7a8f-0
01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.750
Um, there's a small horse
outside.

37868f9b-9adc-480b-91c0-23538c502f2b-0
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:19.430
Like painting a picture of a.

7872e3e8-f1bd-4bda-af0a-a807be0db9bc-0
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:22.160
Covered wagon.

14aa6043-2755-422b-96ce-09e1a18523b8-0
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.567
And then as we kind of move away
from that, the building adjacent

14aa6043-2755-422b-96ce-09e1a18523b8-1
01:33:28.567 --> 01:33:31.450
to the jail is a hotel and it's
two stories.

9a8e57fb-82ef-4c2f-b86b-bd55780bba68-0
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.450
There aren't any walls to this
hotel.

281b96f1-6845-446a-a283-83af2367cb58-0
01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.384
And it looks a little
disheveled, like the people

281b96f1-6845-446a-a283-83af2367cb58-1
01:33:39.384 --> 01:33:43.415
inside all the the tables are
knocked over. A man looks like

281b96f1-6845-446a-a283-83af2367cb58-2
01:33:43.415 --> 01:33:47.248
he just shot a gun because
there's smoke kind of floating

281b96f1-6845-446a-a283-83af2367cb58-3
01:33:47.248 --> 01:33:51.081
out of it. And the building
adjacent to that is a saloon.

281b96f1-6845-446a-a283-83af2367cb58-4
01:33:51.081 --> 01:33:55.244
And we have two people standing
on the roof of the bottom part

281b96f1-6845-446a-a283-83af2367cb58-5
01:33:55.244 --> 01:33:59.210
of the saloon who are dueling,
and underneath that we have.

27065f0d-29df-4f58-b2f1-051e7dcbcddf-0
01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:02.916
Like under the covered part of
the saloon, there are people

27065f0d-29df-4f58-b2f1-051e7dcbcddf-1
01:34:02.916 --> 01:34:04.340
just kind of standing around.

0756be63-7e62-4bcd-8ab5-5f130c97a519-0
01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.090
Um.

0ad8ef3f-f1d5-475a-85e4-ef66b0bf0da9-0
01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:10.650
To the right of the saloon
there's half of a general store

0ad8ef3f-f1d5-475a-85e4-ef66b0bf0da9-1
01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:14.550
and we see a general standing
outside of it. So that's funny.

78304bb0-d3f2-4491-90c6-aa3a9553c2f2-0
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:20.590
And then above the general store
we have.

5d6a873f-413a-415e-a62c-e9aeee591e49-0
01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.690
Another saloon, but this is
called tame east saloon and this

5d6a873f-413a-415e-a62c-e9aeee591e49-1
01:34:24.690 --> 01:34:28.001
one is blue. And again, there
are people kind of standing on

5d6a873f-413a-415e-a62c-e9aeee591e49-2
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:31.149
the roof, people dueling. There
are covered wagons parked

5d6a873f-413a-415e-a62c-e9aeee591e49-3
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:33.320
outside that have been like
patched up.

b60f300b-bed4-40cd-91f2-731ad958cca8-0
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.282
And there's another saloon to
the right of that. Another

b60f300b-bed4-40cd-91f2-731ad958cca8-1
01:34:38.282 --> 01:34:42.375
hotel, and another there's a lot
of saloons. This place likes

b60f300b-bed4-40cd-91f2-731ad958cca8-2
01:34:42.375 --> 01:34:43.299
their saloons.

b0d6a755-0201-47c4-8ab8-cd097d7ad594-0
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:48.258
On the left hand side of the
page there's some mines and it

b0d6a755-0201-47c4-8ab8-cd097d7ad594-1
01:34:48.258 --> 01:34:51.512
looks like they're gold mines
and there are lots of people

b0d6a755-0201-47c4-8ab8-cd097d7ad594-2
01:34:51.512 --> 01:34:52.450
going into those.

13e71c33-1662-4f68-b996-ebb3192f2593-0
01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:56.681
Um, and it looks like this might
be a movie set, which is why

13e71c33-1662-4f68-b996-ebb3192f2593-1
01:34:56.681 --> 01:35:00.286
things aren't full. And on the
left hand side you can see a man

13e71c33-1662-4f68-b996-ebb3192f2593-2
01:35:00.286 --> 01:35:03.890
with a camera, and on the right
hand side you see the same, and

13e71c33-1662-4f68-b996-ebb3192f2593-3
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:07.495
at the top of the page you see
the same. So we assume that this

13e71c33-1662-4f68-b996-ebb3192f2593-4
01:35:07.495 --> 01:35:08.340
is a movie set.

454d72c6-8a81-4ea1-9726-444159efd5bf-0
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:13.130
Which is why the buildings
aren't whole. On the right hand

454d72c6-8a81-4ea1-9726-444159efd5bf-1
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:16.997
side of the page there is a
locomotive train with some smoke

454d72c6-8a81-4ea1-9726-444159efd5bf-2
01:35:16.997 --> 01:35:20.864
billowing out of it, and there
is like some sort of wagon in

454d72c6-8a81-4ea1-9726-444159efd5bf-3
01:35:20.864 --> 01:35:24.922
the center of the train tracks.
It looks like it's about to get

454d72c6-8a81-4ea1-9726-444159efd5bf-4
01:35:24.922 --> 01:35:25.999
hit by the train.

04206443-e697-4104-a8b0-56b8bba3ffb9-0
01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.480
There is a bank with Cowboys and
pioneer women.

c698746b-2c83-44ac-8e9c-63ec1bf56ddd-0
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:35.224
And then there's another
building that's being painted

c698746b-2c83-44ac-8e9c-63ec1bf56ddd-1
01:35:35.224 --> 01:35:38.801
red. So it used to be yellow and
blue and now it's red. There's

c698746b-2c83-44ac-8e9c-63ec1bf56ddd-2
01:35:38.801 --> 01:35:42.100
another saloon with people on
the roof, and they all have.

86b816b7-fca7-458d-8f30-6498d68b2a99-0
01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.588
Bags of money. So we assume that
they stole from the bank.

86b816b7-fca7-458d-8f30-6498d68b2a99-1
01:35:46.588 --> 01:35:49.709
They're dressed like bandits.
They have bandanas over their

86b816b7-fca7-458d-8f30-6498d68b2a99-2
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.969
face.

4be7ffdc-7a48-40d1-84d0-6d603cd146c9-0
01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:55.656
Um we get right hand side and
there's another saloon and then

4be7ffdc-7a48-40d1-84d0-6d603cd146c9-1
01:35:55.656 --> 01:36:00.011
to the top of the page there's
like a backdrop that looks like

4be7ffdc-7a48-40d1-84d0-6d603cd146c9-2
01:36:00.011 --> 01:36:04.435
a sunset and we see a man on a
White Horse who's riding towards

4be7ffdc-7a48-40d1-84d0-6d603cd146c9-3
01:36:04.435 --> 01:36:08.722
it and then there is a stable
that has some horses in it. And

4be7ffdc-7a48-40d1-84d0-6d603cd146c9-4
01:36:08.722 --> 01:36:12.455
then kind of scattered
throughout all these buildings

4be7ffdc-7a48-40d1-84d0-6d603cd146c9-5
01:36:12.455 --> 01:36:16.050
are just different towns folk
dressed in different.

e85a2df6-29e7-4cd2-9c79-27b0f48cdbfc-0
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:22.322
Like character costumes that fit
the wild Wild West theme.

e85a2df6-29e7-4cd2-9c79-27b0f48cdbfc-1
01:36:22.322 --> 01:36:24.750
#END_wild_west OK, that was
great.

0bd06ac1-8931-4f5a-b5f4-b82e6ff955e8-0
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:26.180
Um.

b1438e92-02e8-4776-a8cb-17764934ca47-0
01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:31.440
This will be the last one that
we do today, OK.

51d3493f-fb1f-460e-8f62-9c8dc0c87bde-0
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:36.258
#START_deep_sea_divers So this
one is the image of the ocean,

51d3493f-fb1f-460e-8f62-9c8dc0c87bde-1
01:36:36.258 --> 01:36:40.251
but it's from the side and it's
almost like you're looking at it

51d3493f-fb1f-460e-8f62-9c8dc0c87bde-2
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:41.049
through like.

01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:46.237
Aquarium tank. And so you see
the top of the water, you see a

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-1
01:36:46.237 --> 01:36:50.290
little bit of sky and then you
see the ocean and then the ocean

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-2
01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:53.837
floor. And so on top of the
water we see there are some

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-3
01:36:53.837 --> 01:36:57.575
rocks and then there are people
in boats and the boats are

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-4
01:36:57.575 --> 01:37:01.312
striped, either red and white,
blue and white or green and

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-5
01:37:01.312 --> 01:37:05.175
white. And there are people in
various combinations of those

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-6
01:37:05.175 --> 01:37:09.229
stripes inside of the boats and
they are fishing. And then they

fa43dfd8-628f-4d64-88ab-e07118096597-7
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:12.079
are fishing people fishing off
the sides of.

5b3eff19-97f5-49c2-a0c7-f71e69c30085-0
01:37:12.210 --> 01:37:15.075
The rocks as well, and then one
of the rocks is covered in a

5b3eff19-97f5-49c2-a0c7-f71e69c30085-1
01:37:15.075 --> 01:37:16.250
bunch of blonde mermaids.

d981246a-ecf7-4ec9-be62-57392b7f2391-0
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:21.042
So that's kind of on top of the
water and then in the water we

d981246a-ecf7-4ec9-be62-57392b7f2391-1
01:37:21.042 --> 01:37:22.400
have people swimming.

2e5d382b-c610-42ae-99d6-ed82cbf177d2-0
01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:28.860
And mermaids and it looks like
the people swimming are attached

2e5d382b-c610-42ae-99d6-ed82cbf177d2-1
01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:29.560
to ropes.

f34fcbcf-b4dd-4425-9b55-802822b881e2-0
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.690
That the fishermen have.

b4b2efb7-1d38-4426-a4a2-4a904b1dd40b-0
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:38.375
So they're kind of swimming all
over grabbing different things.

b4b2efb7-1d38-4426-a4a2-4a904b1dd40b-1
01:37:38.375 --> 01:37:42.130
There is a bunch of colorful
coral reef at the bottom that's.

a4c45355-1794-41c8-8a4f-5152dfba3c8c-0
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:47.211
Yellow and pink. There is a
large like stonefish on the

a4c45355-1794-41c8-8a4f-5152dfba3c8c-1
01:37:47.211 --> 01:37:52.072
bottom that a couple of them are
petting. There's a treasure

a4c45355-1794-41c8-8a4f-5152dfba3c8c-2
01:37:52.072 --> 01:37:56.773
chest that has a creature inside
of it. On the bottom left

a4c45355-1794-41c8-8a4f-5152dfba3c8c-3
01:37:56.773 --> 01:37:57.570
there's a.

75bf17a7-bf2a-44c2-ae3f-99750c5a2594-0
01:37:58.310 --> 01:38:00.900
Piece of coral that almost looks
like a human hand.

c554f460-37b0-45b8-ab78-60cb76510c25-0
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:05.653
And there's a lot of red fish,
yellow fish, orange fish, and

c554f460-37b0-45b8-ab78-60cb76510c25-1
01:38:05.653 --> 01:38:09.849
some of these fish are making
shapes together. So we have like

c554f460-37b0-45b8-ab78-60cb76510c25-2
01:38:09.849 --> 01:38:14.112
a school of fish that make the
image of a bigger fish. And then

c554f460-37b0-45b8-ab78-60cb76510c25-3
01:38:14.112 --> 01:38:18.308
we have a fish school of fish
that makes the image of a smiley

c554f460-37b0-45b8-ab78-60cb76510c25-4
01:38:18.308 --> 01:38:22.172
face. And we have a school of
fish that make the image of

c554f460-37b0-45b8-ab78-60cb76510c25-5
01:38:22.172 --> 01:38:24.569
three arrows pointing to the
right.

87757ec4-d1aa-4e56-8cd3-8542e7b1b2ba-0
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:25.920
Um.

d4861d35-19d0-4791-8c9d-f68ade7b47bd-0
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.290
There are.

c0b73d7e-e119-4ec6-a53e-16193aea99f7-0
01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:35.329
There's like a lot of small
details in here, so there's

c0b73d7e-e119-4ec6-a53e-16193aea99f7-1
01:38:35.329 --> 01:38:35.570
like.

b2f4f2a8-4d37-4191-90dd-f8e6c583458d-0
01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:43.491
They have Nets that they're
going around with. Some of the

b2f4f2a8-4d37-4191-90dd-f8e6c583458d-1
01:38:43.491 --> 01:38:45.110
fish have got in the Nets.

542e7bda-b3fa-4cb6-bd8d-7a8bc37b4c8f-0
01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:46.570
Um.

4f7cadf3-1854-4482-8ca7-e0470ad1f2bc-0
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:51.687
And that's pretty much, it's
chaotic, but that's pretty much

4f7cadf3-1854-4482-8ca7-e0470ad1f2bc-1
01:38:51.687 --> 01:38:54.648
it, just a lot of fish and a lot
of people swimming around in the

4f7cadf3-1854-4482-8ca7-e0470ad1f2bc-2
01:38:54.648 --> 01:38:55.860
ocean. #END_deep_sea_divers

01:38:57.190 --> 01:38:59.690
Yeah, OK.

884b4451-b579-4c8c-acfd-988206ba5965-0
01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:04.060
OK, cool. So thank you for your
time today.
