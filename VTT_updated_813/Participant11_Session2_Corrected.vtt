00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.219
Welcome to the second session.
So as a reminder, you will see

56cada22-ee0f-4c91-a31e-286209549336-1
00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.402
two types of pictures. Um,
either a complex scene or some

56cada22-ee0f-4c91-a31e-286209549336-2
00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:17.620
pictures from a graphic novel.
Um.

4c7cda56-8084-4ffd-9e63-86d70eedefce-0
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.388
And your description of them
will help us develop naming

4c7cda56-8084-4ffd-9e63-86d70eedefce-1
00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:25.780
targets for people with
aphasia.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.040
And.

760986f7-c1c6-41c8-b7e5-49297391ad98-0
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.725
For a complex scene, please
describe what you see and what

760986f7-c1c6-41c8-b7e5-49297391ad98-1
00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.790
is happening in detail. And
please take between three and

760986f7-c1c6-41c8-b7e5-49297391ad98-2
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.855
five minutes right, and I'll
give you feedback afterwards

760986f7-c1c6-41c8-b7e5-49297391ad98-3
00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.290
about time and you can start
when you're ready.

8186bfd8-d54c-412c-abf1-67b124594376-0
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.060
OK.

e1114f3c-19c4-45ae-ac4b-af4649fb192d-0
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.890
Make that big. I'm not big,
big, big.

670143cf-4584-4998-b5a6-dd839d1cbb5e-0
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.060
Ready.

4138b370-3abe-44ba-8452-891c43c93904-0

#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
So this is another where's Waldo

2835447e-6f78-4546-9e1b-209629752125-0
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.740
Two page spread.

fc75406e-929f-4792-ba7b-ba88e558f55e-0
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.610
With lots of busy and colorful
activity across 2 pages, it says

fc75406e-929f-4792-ba7b-ba88e558f55e-1
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.250
dinosaurs, spacemen and ghouls.

7ba7d2fc-8509-47c9-bb7f-da81a63e6e71-0
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.970
And.

b03353af-f6d9-4d3e-8a02-8b5018d88fbd-0
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.009
It says few incredible times.
Space and horror are in a mighty

b03353af-f6d9-4d3e-8a02-8b5018d88fbd-1
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.276
muddle here. What cosmic
costumes and great special

b03353af-f6d9-4d3e-8a02-8b5018d88fbd-2
00:01:28.276 --> 00:01:33.199
effects. One of those flying
saucers looks like it's really

b03353af-f6d9-4d3e-8a02-8b5018d88fbd-3
00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:38.123
flying. Are those real aliens
inside? Not actors at all. So

b03353af-f6d9-4d3e-8a02-8b5018d88fbd-4
00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:42.390
what's real and what's made-up
in films like these?

d2a278c2-12db-410d-bd23-2902767d93a0-0
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.270
And starting in the top left
corner.

db6da7c6-4b74-47ff-8686-8c6cf3dfef7c-0
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.140
Of the page.

a947a90d-7d88-45ae-9c4b-a4bba3fdaade-0
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.991
There's a picture of a volcano
that is beginning to erupt, with

a947a90d-7d88-45ae-9c4b-a4bba3fdaade-1
00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:00.767
Cavemen climbing up the side of
it and spewing out the top and

a947a90d-7d88-45ae-9c4b-a4bba3fdaade-2
00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:05.240
clustering all around the
bottom. And there are dinosaurs.

ca90054f-4f36-42b2-9aa8-bcfc33507245-0
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.750
Of different colors red, green,
purple, blue.

e7f6bc76-f37d-4264-bbd7-3ffc36936eee-0
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.140
Umm.

94457a5d-35c1-4378-bd0e-2f87bff7f19a-0
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.753
Below that, on the lower left
part of the page are a couple of

94457a5d-35c1-4378-bd0e-2f87bff7f19a-1
00:02:18.753 --> 00:02:24.130
rooms. One is a daytime room
with lots of people.

e4ba9c5b-21a4-4a3f-b46e-06f2d803a7ab-0
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.060
And Cavemen and a dinosaur or
two.

54f205a0-54d1-4728-ba48-60d0df848f8c-0
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.390
Coming and going through doors.

d0d704b2-bb88-44f3-b37d-921af1ae946b-0
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.250
Oh, and I see some green aliens.

d6488def-9f8d-491d-af13-e97fede80303-0
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.358
{I don't fully understand what's
going on in this page,} but I

d6488def-9f8d-491d-af13-e97fede80303-1
00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:42.570
also see some people dressed up
like mummies.

32faa940-063b-4772-bca3-12e17f285b38-0
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.050
And then to the right of that.

628ce61b-47f4-4177-8c54-32fc59e69510-0
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.790
It goes to a nighttime picture
which looks like Halloween with

628ce61b-47f4-4177-8c54-32fc59e69510-1
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.760
a dark sky and.

43c7ab34-4be7-4b79-a7e2-e7ea5b84f7a4-0
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.590
Black Bats flying and lightning
flashing and.

8d0e7b42-df2c-4866-84ca-6f79d8866106-0
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.037
For some reason there is a soft
serve ice cream, but more green

8d0e7b42-df2c-4866-84ca-6f79d8866106-1
00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:07.313
aliens and ghosts and mummies
and other characters. Oh, and

8d0e7b42-df2c-4866-84ca-6f79d8866106-2
00:03:07.313 --> 00:03:13.116
there are big spotlights shining
in, so maybe this is a scene for

8d0e7b42-df2c-4866-84ca-6f79d8866106-3
00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:13.819
a movie.

99eae00b-b451-4a68-896a-e5a795d8b1d9-0
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.994
As we move over to the right
hand page, this particular image

99eae00b-b451-4a68-896a-e5a795d8b1d9-1
00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:26.078
of the night time with all the
characters continues and there's

99eae00b-b451-4a68-896a-e5a795d8b1d9-2
00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:30.050
a scary tree with a gaping mouth
and spooky eyes.

9ad16d85-17bb-45e3-bea0-e191c407b6bf-0
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.752
And a tree and and lots of
characters and more lights. So

9ad16d85-17bb-45e3-bea0-e191c407b6bf-1
00:03:36.752 --> 00:03:42.339
clearly this is a a film scene.
Then to the right of that is

9ad16d85-17bb-45e3-bea0-e191c407b6bf-2
00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.530
another room.

be8b7da7-633b-4cda-940c-92482abd8eae-0
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.490
It looks like it. Oh, dining
hall.

60f7d48d-0d01-4ce8-876e-6a33306f1727-0
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.820
There is a big buffet area and
food being served, and there's a

60f7d48d-0d01-4ce8-876e-6a33306f1727-1
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.180
picture of a big slice of Berry
pie and lots of people. There's

60f7d48d-0d01-4ce8-876e-6a33306f1727-2
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.373
a pink floor and just lots and
lots of people milling around.

60f7d48d-0d01-4ce8-876e-6a33306f1727-3
00:04:04.373 --> 00:04:08.310
Above that in the upper right
page is another.

0b7b90d9-6435-46be-b11d-046237b6490d-0
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.690
Backdrop for.

6eba6547-488a-465c-a8b6-49f26dd246d1-0
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.150
Movie Picture of space and
people in.

fdca80a1-374b-4676-b6a9-43209cc72dec-0
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.100
Orange and yellow space suits
floating in space.

39b3eddc-b0a9-4567-96af-e179998e63db-0
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.480
There are some round.

caccfcfc-5471-4d73-b044-e9582b9d74e2-0
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.907
Flying saucers that are pink
filled with green aliens. The

caccfcfc-5471-4d73-b044-e9582b9d74e2-1
00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:33.820
bottom has some kind of rough.

361e75fe-a593-4a8b-ad45-116dc6a43734-0
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.891
Landscape of a foreign planet
with space people and aliens and

361e75fe-a593-4a8b-ad45-116dc6a43734-1
00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:44.510
oh, a person without a helmet.
So clearly this is not real

361e75fe-a593-4a8b-ad45-116dc6a43734-2
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.450
outer space.

d2ba1a84-2483-4af2-a103-2357a9e96cd4-0
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.387
And then just off to the side on

d2ba1a84-2483-4af2-a103-2357a9e96cd4-1
00:04:50.387 --> 00:04:53.421
the far right you can see behind
the stage setting and more

d2ba1a84-2483-4af2-a103-2357a9e96cd4-2
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:55.140
people working in the
background. #END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls

dae3dcdb-86b3-4420-8422-52cec64465a9-0
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.870
The end.

bd1726d7-a236-488c-be83-730f51cc3d4f-0
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.320
How much time was that?

45d106ec-0687-434b-87c4-a423d670ad1c-0
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.320
It was just about four minutes,
so good, good. I'm getting

45d106ec-0687-434b-87c4-a423d670ad1c-1
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.030
better with my pacing.

1df1ec68-1b2f-4b41-b634-564cebdd6b14-0
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.590
OK, so the next one is also,
um, it's a graphic novel.

49814f1c-e6b3-4f73-84fc-b1ff197c6414-0
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.880
Describe what you see and what
is happening as we go through

49814f1c-e6b3-4f73-84fc-b1ff197c6414-1
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.310
the story, OK?

907031a3-7780-4336-9a3b-6c59a39ee1a4-0
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.410

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.130
Lots of small square pictures
that are.

12534866-d632-46cb-a1d5-78f5afa3f3c9-0
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.190
Like pencil drawings with
various shades of.

73c82423-c675-4742-b01c-390b2aaeffa0-0
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.960
Cream and beige and brown and
dark, almost black.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.610
The first picture has a window.

e5ad8182-0462-4a0e-bbd2-3d5173c3a962-0
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.525
To the left side and a pot on a
table. It's just like a hand

e5ad8182-0462-4a0e-bbd2-3d5173c3a962-1
00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.860
sculpted pot. The next picture
to that.

8669baa9-4cb4-47a8-b9b3-eca688d1d525-0
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.350
The picture has the window and
the pot and.

c67fcf71-8a94-41bb-8c99-9ca1ec4e8e65-0
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.867
Something flying to the pot.
It's not exactly a bird or an

c67fcf71-8a94-41bb-8c99-9ca1ec4e8e65-1
00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:17.167
insect. It has wings and it's
reaching out its legs, and in

c67fcf71-8a94-41bb-8c99-9ca1ec4e8e65-2
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:21.180
the next picture it has lighted
on the side of the pot.

38ea4111-1e49-45db-ae07-01b9c0c1e159-0
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.360
And then we go down to the next
row of pictures and the window

38ea4111-1e49-45db-ae07-01b9c0c1e159-1
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.680
we have a bigger.

b4108eb3-95e1-4345-865c-512c8a07899b-0
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.459
View into the window and we see
that the glowing Ness was

b4108eb3-95e1-4345-865c-512c8a07899b-1
00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:35.770
actually a lamp.

e007003e-4abe-40e2-b4c6-c4cc2349c6d2-0
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.250
Umm.

341dc602-a735-4fbb-ac23-48ee4e548ac0-0
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.040
And we see arms and hands of a
person.

f33b9d74-f448-4745-94b3-86ad7a3b9a61-0
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.261
Could be a man that's wearing
long sleeves and a vest, white

f33b9d74-f448-4745-94b3-86ad7a3b9a61-1
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:50.030
shirt, dark vest and in the
right hand.

cb4398f8-6bc5-4603-9b15-0aff4fe0f534-0
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.810
Is a writing implement and
underneath is a piece of paper.

fe7fd99b-d674-4135-bdc2-a439b010c37e-0
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.465
And in the pot, it looks like
the little creature has gone

fe7fd99b-d674-4135-bdc2-a439b010c37e-1
00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:02.830
inside and there's just a little
forked tail sticking out.

b96b2cb8-5fbc-4884-be1e-f28c1c86992e-0
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.165
The next picture over is a close
up of the handwriting on the

b96b2cb8-5fbc-4884-be1e-f28c1c86992e-1
00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:08.560
paper.

9dc3e8a1-1b66-40f8-a370-852893f71fd6-0
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.100
And it looks like there might be
two piece pieces of paper

9dc3e8a1-1b66-40f8-a370-852893f71fd6-1
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.140
currency or tickets in front of.

b08c32eb-e1d1-44f6-8266-07ce07c6afe1-0
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.680
The paper that's being written
on.

2e7715ae-edce-4a8d-8fe1-0a3837c51a84-0
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.010
On the 3rd row of pictures on
this page.

56e87132-4fea-460f-ad37-d26944b5ec4b-0
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.510
The hand is folding up.

d7ae7afc-2772-480d-9907-8fd2bb0994e8-0
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.660
The written page.

be20de08-0fad-4bef-98d1-64ccd01dd7a6-0
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.557
And moving to the next picture
over, folding it origami style

be20de08-0fad-4bef-98d1-64ccd01dd7a6-1
00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:35.560
into a bird.

a3909991-c835-486b-b606-4896b98b8ef9-0
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.939
And then in the next picture
over, putting the folded up

a3909991-c835-486b-b606-4896b98b8ef9-1
00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.870
paper bird into an envelope.

5e40a6a3-beb0-419f-9158-e654cc73e861-0
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.680
The fourth line.

7220e699-aca1-4bba-b2a5-239a8bfdace8-0
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.226
With three pictures, the first
picture has money also going,

7220e699-aca1-4bba-b2a5-239a8bfdace8-1
00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:56.082
paper bills also going into the
envelope and then the picture

7220e699-aca1-4bba-b2a5-239a8bfdace8-2
00:07:56.082 --> 00:08:00.702
shifts to a close up of the
person and it does look like a

7220e699-aca1-4bba-b2a5-239a8bfdace8-3
00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:05.635
man's face licking the envelope
flap to seal it. And the final

7220e699-aca1-4bba-b2a5-239a8bfdace8-4
00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:10.725
picture on this page we see the
front of the envelope focused on

7220e699-aca1-4bba-b2a5-239a8bfdace8-5
00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:13.780
and stamp being fixed into the
corner.

60cbba66-6c1f-4354-bb0f-dc772cc2d229-0
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.993
On the next page, at the top are
three squares across the top

60cbba66-6c1f-4354-bb0f-dc772cc2d229-1
00:08:19.993 --> 00:08:24.262
with different pictures. It
looks like the man. We've got

60cbba66-6c1f-4354-bb0f-dc772cc2d229-2
00:08:24.262 --> 00:08:24.630
legs.

9c5d903b-299b-4256-a7aa-985b1d614767-0
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.090
And a suit.

c4015050-f627-41a3-8fff-2fd78b300146-0
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.450
And a hand holding an envelope
and.

de1b7a97-3f98-482b-b59a-c5aaa09798a8-0
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.505
A small white creature by its
side with little legs walking

de1b7a97-3f98-482b-b59a-c5aaa09798a8-1
00:08:34.505 --> 00:08:35.330
down stairs.

99144434-e862-4aa9-8034-bf2475eafb1f-0
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.640
And the next picture over the
man.

fc3e5447-df41-4511-8da4-226eecbe8946-0
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.482
And his full body, with wearing
a hat, has stopped, and is

fc3e5447-df41-4511-8da4-226eecbe8946-1
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:47.814
talking to a peasant woman with
a courteous over her head, and a

fc3e5447-df41-4511-8da4-226eecbe8946-2
00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:51.813
basket and an umbrella hanging
over her arm, and the little

fc3e5447-df41-4511-8da4-226eecbe8946-3
00:08:51.813 --> 00:08:54.279
white creature is still by his
side.

22065369-5375-4a10-bcf7-c46281235945-0
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.730
The next picture over, the man
is approaching.

782c05b6-5271-49fa-80cb-8025e23e8bdb-0
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.250
A strange kind of box.

aaba305c-caa9-43df-9259-593d9e420d75-0
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:08.755
It has buttons and a coned top
and wings and I don't know what

aaba305c-caa9-43df-9259-593d9e420d75-1
00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:09.230
it is.

21d82d86-163b-4358-aaee-c7212dd5b4c4-0
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.469
But the next row down of three
pictures, he approaches the box

21d82d86-163b-4358-aaee-c7212dd5b4c4-1
00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:18.385
and there are buttons and it
looks like he's reading the

21d82d86-163b-4358-aaee-c7212dd5b4c4-2
00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:22.783
instructions. The next picture
over he might be inserting a key

21d82d86-163b-4358-aaee-c7212dd5b4c4-3
00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:26.700
and a window has opened in this
box and he's putting the

21d82d86-163b-4358-aaee-c7212dd5b4c4-4
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.800
envelope inside.

c32e3ffc-9cc8-49a0-8828-8a1885977c82-0
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:33.320
And the next picture is a close
up of his face, looking upward.

66cf6d88-3f04-4f50-ba6c-e41bce2f1b84-0
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.160
And at the bottom of the page is
1 big picture.

1bbfc195-6fa3-4106-ab4b-24c686148017-0
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.930
Of the box.

7c51faf0-d4c0-4a01-8b2b-4ad75535074d-0
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.530
With a balloon attached to it.

97139297-3caa-4c8c-b388-2b0eb1cc4116-0
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.970
On a landscape.

e7442ada-1fac-4eda-afcb-e4fa9f6c25e8-0
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.778
A kind of desolate landscape
with large leaves growing out of

e7442ada-1fac-4eda-afcb-e4fa9f6c25e8-1
00:09:49.778 --> 00:09:52.030
the ground and he is walking
away.

e094a1e8-7725-4e81-baf2-3f5d399cfb2e-0
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.530
On the next page.

a59b494e-8ee3-402c-b886-39ef4cc43cff-0
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.860
There are three squares across
the top.

409ef208-e351-4e83-a281-b7c4699747b0-0
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.269
And there are four rows of three
squares each, and it's a close

409ef208-e351-4e83-a281-b7c4699747b0-1
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:12.356
up of 1 leaf, and then it's a
closer up of 1 leaf with a kind

409ef208-e351-4e83-a281-b7c4699747b0-2
00:10:12.356 --> 00:10:16.443
of split coming down the center
of it and it looks like rain.

409ef208-e351-4e83-a281-b7c4699747b0-3
00:10:16.443 --> 00:10:19.740
And the third picture across the
top is the leaf.

d4c64508-7d68-460e-b28d-28306c8e2990-0
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:22.880
Ohh.

56ed4465-6565-46f1-8038-abb4a394e3ec-0
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.282
Splitting further and this is a
two page spread and we actually

56ed4465-6565-46f1-8038-abb4a394e3ec-1
00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:31.080
go across to the second page to
the right.

3b1880c3-9bed-442f-8f5e-1c54135d0c52-0
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.119
To continue and the leaf is
splitting open further and

3b1880c3-9bed-442f-8f5e-1c54135d0c52-1
00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:39.220
there's a little curly thing on
a stalk.

e6892301-4273-4bb1-a796-67331e2989bc-0
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.450
Emerging from the split.

4fed0295-d75c-4fd8-868c-4c0e5d34fbfe-0
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.530
In the next picture.

8678cbcc-cfae-42ef-a563-4cbe8aa09ca0-0
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.560
The LEAF has split further down.

1392c522-3d6f-46c4-9098-39720de693dd-0
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.770
And the stalk is emerging more.

a92a6f2a-8c65-406d-9deb-ecbc041759ed-0
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.130
And in the four in the final
picture on the top row.

bc260d9c-72ac-41cc-b19d-701eec99469a-0
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.820
The leaf.

67c65dcd-36a6-4387-837b-8f6558b2599b-0
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.540
Is almost crumbling as it splits
and.

995622f5-b6a5-46d2-bb19-65f395a9fcfc-0
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.030
The little stalk in the centre
has developed a little circular.

1f044567-6efc-4f92-bffd-60d0416b6015-0
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.870
Something. And then when we go
to the next row of pictures, we

1f044567-6efc-4f92-bffd-60d0416b6015-1
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.580
focus on that circular something
that looks almost like a

1f044567-6efc-4f92-bffd-60d0416b6015-2
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.546
dandelion, a circle with little
spokes coming out from it and

1f044567-6efc-4f92-bffd-60d0416b6015-3
00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:25.448
the next picture is a close up
and the image is getting more

1f044567-6efc-4f92-bffd-60d0416b6015-4
00:11:25.448 --> 00:11:25.959
defined.

1a2a86bd-e42e-416d-8c8b-094deb0a10e3-0
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.857
Looking more like a Daisy and
then closer up again, it looks

1a2a86bd-e42e-416d-8c8b-094deb0a10e3-1
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:35.010
more like a dandelion head the
Whitehead.

81cd9046-afae-4143-8adf-cff7446c1e1b-0
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.005
And some of the little white
seeds are beginning to flick off

81cd9046-afae-4143-8adf-cff7446c1e1b-1
00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:43.850
from it and we continue to the
next picture where that.

ca3627c5-67b8-4e85-9aa7-944621ad0dae-0
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.830
Continues and the next picture
there are fewer of the.

345ffc0c-987a-4135-bfdf-3fa0ed8f74d8-0
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.453
White seeds on the round
circular head and more of them

345ffc0c-987a-4135-bfdf-3fa0ed8f74d8-1
00:11:55.453 --> 00:11:59.640
have flown away and on the final
picture on the 2nd row.

5838da1e-90e8-4001-ab2c-9f8ca581ef7d-0
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.620
It's a circle without the white
fluffy things.

7676d0b0-20f4-4ece-b44c-42843c95ddbb-0
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.140
And the third row starts with
the circle.

8847ba1c-e5f7-47fa-b132-60d173275e7b-0
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.270
With no white fluffy things.

d3acc31e-50df-4d6e-8432-cc2391f83500-0
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:22.624
But there are white little
flecks centered in 12345, so

d3acc31e-50df-4d6e-8432-cc2391f83500-1
00:12:22.624 --> 00:12:27.750
there are three six scallops,
almost like big petals.

71330c1d-55a6-4f98-9780-4ce827ff82c5-0
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.540
And on the next picture, the
White Flex and the center of the

71330c1d-55a6-4f98-9780-4ce827ff82c5-1
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.090
six scallops are getting bigger.

3c594184-b5cf-4dbc-8b84-5b36a5e1eeba-0
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.305
And there are some other white
flecks around it floating in the

3c594184-b5cf-4dbc-8b84-5b36a5e1eeba-1
00:12:40.305 --> 00:12:40.530
air.

fadd14fe-cdd0-4b48-8027-ffe3a9fc90f0-0
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.142
And in the third picture, the
white flecks have grown to the

fadd14fe-cdd0-4b48-8027-ffe3a9fc90f0-1
00:12:46.142 --> 00:12:50.255
side of size of little seeds
almost. And in the fourth

fadd14fe-cdd0-4b48-8027-ffe3a9fc90f0-2
00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:54.967
picture, three of those seeds
have fallen to the ground and it

fadd14fe-cdd0-4b48-8027-ffe3a9fc90f0-3
00:12:54.967 --> 00:12:57.510
looks like little  quickly
drawn.

ec165eaa-d1ad-465c-9c48-32acbfaad90e-0
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.622
Creatures with legs and wings
and a tail are approaching the

ec165eaa-d1ad-465c-9c48-32acbfaad90e-1
00:13:02.622 --> 00:13:04.670
seeds, perhaps to nibble them.

814b8e86-e62d-41eb-905b-fb679b6d4d45-0
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.450
The next picture over.

614baa2d-ec37-4d9f-9920-c86b5ea490f7-0
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.260
The six petaled.

3b8d3b7d-0e4c-4605-bfb6-f1d8a39d812e-0
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.470
Flower thing has no more seeds
and it's just dark. And the

3b8d3b7d-0e4c-4605-bfb6-f1d8a39d812e-1
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.860
final picture on that row, it's
all even darker.

2a6a0394-d6e4-4a35-8b82-07047b53d9a5-0
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.572
We go to the final row of
pictures on the bottom and the

2a6a0394-d6e4-4a35-8b82-07047b53d9a5-1
00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:26.590
six petaled.

418c7187-4487-4dd1-b4a4-53ee094e4d34-0
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.997
Flower is beginning to decay
with little poles breaking up in

418c7187-4487-4dd1-b4a4-53ee094e4d34-1
00:13:32.997 --> 00:13:38.146
it, and that progresses further
in the next picture, and in the

418c7187-4487-4dd1-b4a4-53ee094e4d34-2
00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:40.559
third picture it's about half.

71056607-b26c-4af8-a3b7-dd22d082aa7a-0
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.070
And then the 4th picture it's
almost all.

a45f7713-026f-41fa-843e-1eee319de528-0
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.577
Broken away and just showing the
outlines of it and the fifth

a45f7713-026f-41fa-843e-1eee319de528-1
00:13:53.577 --> 00:13:54.110
picture.

1a42be79-7031-43c3-a745-667d9284b17b-0
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.308
It's just outlines and it looks
like there might even be snow

1a42be79-7031-43c3-a745-667d9284b17b-1
00:13:59.308 --> 00:14:03.466
falling because in the final
picture there is a layer of snow

1a42be79-7031-43c3-a745-667d9284b17b-2
00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:07.691
that has covered up the stock
and is beginning to cover up the

1a42be79-7031-43c3-a745-667d9284b17b-3
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.100
bottom of the petals.

fc1ccccf-60d8-4015-8403-21186f3d1b4e-0
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.990
The next two pages.

fea7df34-152d-4c36-aefc-e665eeda5444-0
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.430
are

5007a1da-57fb-4a81-8902-654110bdd746-0
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:27.523
Again, a black and white pencil
drawing with shades of light and

5007a1da-57fb-4a81-8902-654110bdd746-1
00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:32.819
darkness, and it looks kind of
like a cityscape with large

5007a1da-57fb-4a81-8902-654110bdd746-2
00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:38.473
massive buildings. A big block
with lots of little rectangular

5007a1da-57fb-4a81-8902-654110bdd746-3
00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:39.730
windows in it.

6df61cd4-ca4f-47fb-92b9-d8a24bfca016-0
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.290
In the background and in the
foreground there's a lower.

53eec3b5-794c-4e09-9716-8acc56bcf1a1-0
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.435
Blocky structure that's darker
and it has other little

53eec3b5-794c-4e09-9716-8acc56bcf1a1-1
00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:56.883
structures on top that are, you
know, either conical or squarish

53eec3b5-794c-4e09-9716-8acc56bcf1a1-2
00:14:56.883 --> 00:15:00.950
combination. And on the ground
it looks.

f10af362-bb7f-48d0-b288-1f9e9e42519c-0
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.083
Like it's probably snow covered
and either there's smoke coming

f10af362-bb7f-48d0-b288-1f9e9e42519c-1
00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:11.506
out of some of the tops and the
little stacks on the buildings,

f10af362-bb7f-48d0-b288-1f9e9e42519c-2
00:15:11.506 --> 00:15:15.170
or there's swirls of smoke or
even some of the snow.

cf0b6c38-a2d0-4f09-8261-e2fbed0f9111-0
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.700
And on the next page.

6a1303a5-b04e-4341-9307-37216384eeca-0
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.086
It's not exactly the same
picture, but they look related

6a1303a5-b04e-4341-9307-37216384eeca-1
00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:26.740
so I don't.

8e342257-3019-440c-bb7d-abc08036ff0d-0
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.988
Know if we're doing a close up
or moved over to another area

8e342257-3019-440c-bb7d-abc08036ff0d-1
00:15:31.988 --> 00:15:35.650
and there's some more what
looked like smokestacks

83cc9170-ce42-4def-8210-9cd38be26b13-0
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.960
Umm.

14cc5073-1387-486e-aba7-9cfcaec05014-0
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.620
And more swirling, like it's
snowing.

42cf7b24-d2ba-4ef9-86db-3fd34707fcce-0
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.180
{I don't know how else to
describe this page.}

d7718b64-3e61-4065-a25e-018d0474c082-0
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.210
On the next two pages, we're
back to a number of squares.

4c8c768e-67aa-4d96-b1b8-3d83b1195f0f-0
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.780
With smaller images that are
showing a progression.

098db457-bd6d-4458-9ed0-b88ce8921ec9-0
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.630
At the top left, is that
handmade

f7ddf925-f938-49a8-94b2-e362261230b2-0
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.070
Piece of pottery with.

478dff3c-c00e-4fd1-bd18-1c2be618f8b8-0
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.898
Some jagged thing just peeking
out at the top of it and the

478dff3c-c00e-4fd1-bd18-1c2be618f8b8-1
00:16:11.898 --> 00:16:15.919
next picture over. The little
jagged things have popped up and

478dff3c-c00e-4fd1-bd18-1c2be618f8b8-2
00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:19.492
they look like the mouths of
baby birds, and there is a

478dff3c-c00e-4fd1-bd18-1c2be618f8b8-3
00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:23.130
flying creature approaching with
something in its mouth.

ad144176-cfb4-48d4-92da-539f19c4794e-0
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.280
And in the third picture.

01175802-7cb6-4325-8bda-4234a44469db-0
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.653
The big flying creature has
lighted on the edge and is about

01175802-7cb6-4325-8bda-4234a44469db-1
00:16:29.653 --> 00:16:32.990
to feed the little baby birds
with what's in its mouth.

96b5412d-ca1a-4410-ada8-5b2c706180d9-0
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.370
Beneath these three pictures, on
the left side is 1 big picture.

0c42f4ee-e105-40d5-ab83-50cc4f2f0441-0
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.790
Of a person sitting on an unmade
bed in a room.

3fbc353d-5e09-4688-9664-fd6a79b39ab0-0
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.670
Somewhat cluttered room.

2dcfb647-ccff-40e8-b858-2da945d43d42-0
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.475
On the wall or little notes
stuck on the wall and then in

2dcfb647-ccff-40e8-b858-2da945d43d42-1
00:16:52.475 --> 00:16:57.131
front of this person is the
window where this pottery and

2dcfb647-ccff-40e8-b858-2da945d43d42-2
00:16:57.131 --> 00:17:01.787
the baby birds and the adult
bird are located. And we see

2dcfb647-ccff-40e8-b858-2da945d43d42-3
00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:06.684
some laundry hanging around it
as well. And there is a table

2dcfb647-ccff-40e8-b858-2da945d43d42-4
00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:11.822
that looks like a writing table
with a chair and some books and

2dcfb647-ccff-40e8-b858-2da945d43d42-5
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.070
open book and the same lamp.

c540dcac-d574-42aa-a146-263c17aad54d-0
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.236
And next to the bed, on the bed
sitting behind the man, he's

c540dcac-d574-42aa-a146-263c17aad54d-1
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:24.013
sitting there holding a picture
frame with three people in it,

c540dcac-d574-42aa-a146-263c17aad54d-2
00:17:24.013 --> 00:17:27.730
and the white creature that had
been out walking with him is.

bcbb3750-a137-4e40-905c-8b2b8c5255f4-0
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.690
Curled up, sleeping next to him
on the bed while he sits up.

e9e20c4e-55e4-445b-bef6-f6a781eb27b8-0
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.960
And his shoes are by the side of
the bed.

7846004c-d753-4fed-863a-385473e62ebc-0
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.479
Going to the next page, there
are three pictures of across the

7846004c-d753-4fed-863a-385473e62ebc-1
00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:44.250
top, and there are four rows
with three pictures each.

9994a81b-ade3-4eaa-9f34-b9e62c452be1-0
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.537
The top left picture has the
little creature on the bed. It's

9994a81b-ade3-4eaa-9f34-b9e62c452be1-1
00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:54.095
close up, and the next picture,
the little creature has woken up

9994a81b-ade3-4eaa-9f34-b9e62c452be1-2
00:17:54.095 --> 00:17:58.162
and is sitting up on its
haunches, supported by its front

9994a81b-ade3-4eaa-9f34-b9e62c452be1-3
00:17:58.162 --> 00:18:01.808
legs, and its long tail is
curled up and around and

9994a81b-ade3-4eaa-9f34-b9e62c452be1-4
00:18:01.808 --> 00:18:06.086
hovering over its head. And on
the third picture, the little

9994a81b-ade3-4eaa-9f34-b9e62c452be1-5
00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.330
creature is leaping off the bed.

0be0b47e-0a10-43ca-9a2d-2962e6a15811-0
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.509
On the next row, the person
still sitting on the bed holding

0be0b47e-0a10-43ca-9a2d-2962e6a15811-1
00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:17.542
the frame is leaning in the
direction of the white creature

0be0b47e-0a10-43ca-9a2d-2962e6a15811-2
00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:19.290
to look where it has gone.

f59b42d0-6640-4f1f-bfc4-9e070853078f-0
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.107
And in the next picture over,
the little creature is

f59b42d0-6640-4f1f-bfc4-9e070853078f-1
00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:28.885
disappearing through a hole, a
square hole in the floor. All we

f59b42d0-6640-4f1f-bfc4-9e070853078f-2
00:18:28.885 --> 00:18:30.080
see is its tail.

6bae5d0a-b4f4-444b-b0b9-fda65a699e9e-0
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.470
Disappearing down the hole and
there's a ladder, and the next

6bae5d0a-b4f4-444b-b0b9-fda65a699e9e-1
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.910
picture the man is climbing down
the ladder.

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-0
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.771
On the 3rd row, the first
picture we see the creature on

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-1
00:18:41.771 --> 00:18:45.805
the floor looking at an envelope
on the floor, and the next

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-2
00:18:45.805 --> 00:18:49.839
picture the creature is looking
up at the man whose hand is

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-3
00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:53.738
reaching down to pick up the
envelope and we just see his

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-4
00:18:53.738 --> 00:18:57.906
hand reaching down. The next
picture is a close up of the man

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-5
00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:02.141
opening the envelope, holding it
in his hands with the flap up

f1a8701d-085f-460a-8baa-2fad7b4e1a22-6
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.150
looking inside.

21320546-3877-4421-8024-dbcd4328fbde-0
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.050
And the next picture on the 4th
row.

d4e7f6a1-ad37-4745-a3fb-4d2fbd382c9d-0
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.018
It's the envelope that had the
folded origami bird that he has

d4e7f6a1-ad37-4745-a3fb-4d2fbd382c9d-1
00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:15.000
taken out of the envelope and
he's smiling.

31654077-59a6-448f-9c5a-86529175afd7-0
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.017
And then he opens up, he unfolds
the origami, and he sees the

31654077-59a6-448f-9c5a-86529175afd7-1
00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:21.100
written words, and he's smiling
more.

e7ba4020-872f-463f-b6eb-3f521f4b4e02-0
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.167
And in the final picture on the
page, he's holding the paper and

e7ba4020-872f-463f-b6eb-3f521f4b4e02-1
00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:28.570
looking out the window, looking
up.

31b63fc2-96fa-4395-82da-e07749f1ed5f-0
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.050
On this page there are nine
little squares.

f591117d-0412-4670-945c-bdb433a22e1e-0
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.090
Of drawings and the top left
square.

e13cae4e-547d-45ab-8279-ee1d9fd283f9-0
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.050
Has another origami creature
that looks like.

32911e62-c033-4515-95be-30e8711e4d2c-0
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.683
My first thought was a scorpion,
but it's shaped more like the

32911e62-c033-4515-95be-30e8711e4d2c-1
00:19:49.683 --> 00:19:53.330
white creature from his bed and
in the next picture.

4c1b8115-1db5-430f-8554-437ce5e620e4-0
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.230
Is a strange.

3472d5dd-2674-44a7-8d8a-0d99a93993a8-0
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:04.987
Conical shape with a round door
or an opening showing something

3472d5dd-2674-44a7-8d8a-0d99a93993a8-1
00:20:04.987 --> 00:20:10.550
round almost like the sun with
sunbeams coming out of it.

2e2707a3-ac38-49a6-b8e1-9dbf1e15a9b8-0
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:19.250
The next picture shows a coat
hook rack with a hat and a shirt

2e2707a3-ac38-49a6-b8e1-9dbf1e15a9b8-1
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.870
hanging on it.

8f483d73-9123-45c3-a511-f94b6473daaa-0
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.380
The next picture has a bowl
with.

09608255-8064-4822-addf-7df21546aeef-0
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:32.782
Something like a fork perhaps,
or a toothbrush next to it and

09608255-8064-4822-addf-7df21546aeef-1
00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:34.970
in the bowl are strange.

b838460c-7ec1-4cc5-bd69-5c5cc18fcc42-0
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.090
Curling things sticking out of
the bowl.

f894ff18-d3ae-4dd7-b9f4-dc4c8e9ee860-0
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:45.990
The next picture is an unfolded
piece of paper with some simple

f894ff18-d3ae-4dd7-b9f4-dc4c8e9ee860-1
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.250
line drawings.

3dd327dd-42fa-493a-8236-cc9e5d8d9d5c-0
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.650
Umm.

304ebb75-80e0-4f3d-b56d-50af0ee376eb-0
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.570
We have maybe a boat with some
smokestacks.

1940c6b9-bea9-45b7-a8c9-f6d593fddd2b-0
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.080
And a circle and something that
looks like a sun.

833dc4fc-4be1-437c-a09c-34ba0d18a091-0
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.740
The next picture.

0986f1d3-b425-43e4-95e9-275f0a5b612d-0
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.930
I don't know if this is a
steampunk coffee maker.

81c1dcf9-47be-4799-9de5-3457e3ba516d-0
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.620
It's a strange contraption.

6428e118-63e7-4f72-ac4d-b182fe77e4d7-0
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.140
Cylindrical with a handle and a
spout.

bb71238e-cbe8-4de5-ac11-3a2ec95332c6-0
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.597
And the next picture? Ah, there
is a cup of coffee sitting on a

bb71238e-cbe8-4de5-ac11-3a2ec95332c6-1
00:21:19.597 --> 00:21:22.250
saucer on top of a folded
newspaper.

70a22c7c-7a5c-4676-850d-2c56855f16ed-0
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.754
The next picture is a portrait
of three people, a man, a woman

70a22c7c-7a5c-4676-850d-2c56855f16ed-1
00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:31.370
on either side and a girl
sitting between them.

9f9a5a94-5476-4a45-9987-3fd8d08973c8-0
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.365
And the final picture on this
page is a close up of two hands,

9f9a5a94-5476-4a45-9987-3fd8d08973c8-1
00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:42.650
one larger hand putting a coin
into a open hand underneath it.

823dea80-e87d-4070-b656-b862291814fb-0
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.780
{Oh my}

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-0
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.234
Now we go to another two page
spread. The first page on the

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-1
00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:55.826
left is a big picture of a looks
like a family gathering around a

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-2
00:21:55.826 --> 00:22:00.140
table. The man, the woman and
the child at the table and down

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-3
00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.314
on the floor hoping for some
food to drop from the table is

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-4
00:22:04.314 --> 00:22:08.211
the little creature with the big
curly tail, and in the

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-5
00:22:08.211 --> 00:22:12.316
background is that strange
conical thing with the circular

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-6
00:22:12.316 --> 00:22:16.073
opening. Oh, and there's the
hat, and it looks like a

ee700185-2551-434a-ab00-830fc514cf57-7
00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:18.230
kerchief hanging from the wall.

6362a793-2a1c-480d-b379-85181451e2ba-0
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.120
And a mantle piece with the
plant and the framed family

6362a793-2a1c-480d-b379-85181451e2ba-1
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.840
picture and the origami and some
other things on the wall.

0d71f5e7-8bcd-4e05-985b-b15b23c339a0-0
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.310
Then we go to the next page, and
there are some smaller pictures,

0d71f5e7-8bcd-4e05-985b-b15b23c339a0-1
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.156
pictures with close-ups. There's
a the first one it looks like

0d71f5e7-8bcd-4e05-985b-b15b23c339a0-2
00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:41.187
the girl is putting on a pair of
boots, and in the next one she's

0d71f5e7-8bcd-4e05-985b-b15b23c339a0-3
00:22:41.187 --> 00:22:44.728
reaching down to the little
creature that looks to have a

0d71f5e7-8bcd-4e05-985b-b15b23c339a0-4
00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:48.514
hat in its mouth. And in the
next picture the little girl has

0d71f5e7-8bcd-4e05-985b-b15b23c339a0-5
00:22:48.514 --> 00:22:49.980
put the hat on her head.

d55d2773-2951-49ef-a3ca-7b90de6a7aa6-0
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.873
And the next picture is a larger
picture of the girl outside

d55d2773-2951-49ef-a3ca-7b90de6a7aa6-1
00:22:56.873 --> 00:23:01.283
going down steps, like on a
street in the neighborhood.

d55d2773-2951-49ef-a3ca-7b90de6a7aa6-2
00:23:01.283 --> 00:23:06.243
That's lots of steps, and the
little creature is bounding down

d55d2773-2951-49ef-a3ca-7b90de6a7aa6-3
00:23:06.243 --> 00:23:07.740
the steps with her.

1e8addec-3bb4-4ec7-b665-f423bab17cc5-0
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.877
And the next to that are three
other little detail pictures of

1e8addec-3bb4-4ec7-b665-f423bab17cc5-1
00:23:12.877 --> 00:23:16.885
girl walking quickly with the
little creature, and then she

1e8addec-3bb4-4ec7-b665-f423bab17cc5-2
00:23:16.885 --> 00:23:20.892
and the creature stop and point
to some white things on the

1e8addec-3bb4-4ec7-b665-f423bab17cc5-3
00:23:20.892 --> 00:23:21.359
ground.

ee626222-8ce5-407b-9bc3-985e6356d133-0
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.224
And then the
final bottom picture of this

ee626222-8ce5-407b-9bc3-985e6356d133-1
00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:28.610
page. The girl is holding out
her hand with a glowing circle

ee626222-8ce5-407b-9bc3-985e6356d133-2
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.219
hovering just above her hand. #END_arrival_6 

4742f76f-5ed8-4b4c-b54d-6ddcd25b6db6-0
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.645
OK. How was was good? That was
about 15 minutes, actually 12

4742f76f-5ed8-4b4c-b54d-6ddcd25b6db6-1
00:23:38.645 --> 00:23:43.404
minutes. OK. Yeah. Was that
within the time frame? Oh,

4742f76f-5ed8-4b4c-b54d-6ddcd25b6db6-2
00:23:43.404 --> 00:23:44.010
great.

ce3eca8e-94be-42a4-9bdf-af788c209494-0
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.580
And it's.

477753ca-c0d0-4604-8050-dbc528aa1fe1-0
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.290
Are what we're aiming for. So
that was good, great.

ab910077-7852-4b87-ae47-028559d4ce16-0
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.681
OK, so moving on to the next
item. It is a graphic novel

ab910077-7852-4b87-ae47-028559d4ce16-1
00:23:56.681 --> 00:24:01.451
again. OK, so I'm going to look
like I'm not staring at you

ab910077-7852-4b87-ae47-028559d4ce16-2
00:24:01.451 --> 00:24:04.790
because I have two screens. One
has the.

f3945a69-452b-4122-a9d7-766850955c01-0
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.559
Camera in it. But my bigger
screen doesn't have the camera.

f3945a69-452b-4122-a9d7-766850955c01-1
00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:13.314
But I can see the picture better
and I'm not going to be

f3945a69-452b-4122-a9d7-766850955c01-2
00:24:13.314 --> 00:24:17.201
straining so much. OK, OK, so
#START_quest here we have a

f3945a69-452b-4122-a9d7-766850955c01-3
00:24:17.201 --> 00:24:21.286
storybook. It's a two page, 2
pages that are open on the left

f3945a69-452b-4122-a9d7-766850955c01-4
00:24:21.286 --> 00:24:25.239
hand page were outdoors. It
looks like we're in a City Park

f3945a69-452b-4122-a9d7-766850955c01-5
00:24:25.239 --> 00:24:27.480
with a little bit of a
stonework.

996727f7-2bfe-4e43-8dd8-0698fe89d1e1-0
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.068
Um, holding back or setting a
boundary with the grassy area.

996727f7-2bfe-4e43-8dd8-0698fe89d1e1-1
00:24:33.068 --> 00:24:36.980
There's a bench, there's a trash
can, there's a.

889dd980-10b9-4d21-a806-d64d798ca1fc-0
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.920
Lamppost and there's a big.

47462a67-58ac-4e75-8883-051a7483e1d7-0
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.460
Sculpture statue of A.

8311f7b7-7620-48e2-9063-e00828adc3fa-0
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.060
Person with wings.

084e1a73-a6e8-49e7-886e-79c981c6ec5e-0
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.601
And there's some words on the
page, it says 4 Darcy, and then

084e1a73-a6e8-49e7-886e-79c981c6ec5e-1
00:24:51.601 --> 00:24:55.038
there's some other technical
words about the book and it's

084e1a73-a6e8-49e7-886e-79c981c6ec5e-2
00:24:55.038 --> 00:24:56.320
copyright and whatnot.

ecaca745-2a0e-4bb7-89a3-7d613f27aeae-0
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.499
And further in the background of
this cityscape, there are a few

ecaca745-2a0e-4bb7-89a3-7d613f27aeae-1
00:25:02.499 --> 00:25:06.835
trees with a few leaves on them,
and behind them you can see

ecaca745-2a0e-4bb7-89a3-7d613f27aeae-2
00:25:06.835 --> 00:25:07.830
rising towers.

ad5d4006-ab28-498f-99be-321bafb23b76-0
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.540
On the next page.

334da96e-ed61-4530-b820-25d16e864556-0
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.440


ac31de37-b4d1-4eef-9edf-23995d2c0bb1-0
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.960
We see two.

602df36c-65d2-436d-a0f3-1ff24410cfa5-0
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:22.294
Young children like twins,
perhaps a boy and a girl

602df36c-65d2-436d-a0f3-1ff24410cfa5-1
00:25:22.294 --> 00:25:26.520
standing under an archway in the
cityscape.

b44b37c6-3fd9-4325-afad-6cdae7d5e0f9-0
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.524
To the left is a a 2 seated
bicycle and there's also a door

b44b37c6-3fd9-4325-afad-6cdae7d5e0f9-1
00:25:33.524 --> 00:25:35.970
in the archway and a lamp.

1478198a-71fe-4ce8-b68f-c8d59893358d-0
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.469
Overhead and it looks like it
has started to rain and we can

1478198a-71fe-4ce8-b68f-c8d59893358d-1
00:25:41.469 --> 00:25:44.410
see some other sculptures around
them.

ed6fd296-c082-4f06-acd0-3c2b53868e1b-0
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:54.651
And the next turn the page the
door has opened and a wizard

ed6fd296-c082-4f06-acd0-3c2b53868e1b-1
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:57.020
type person has entered.

4795794c-59f6-408a-864b-b72adbf401f3-0
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.460
Come through the doors and
startle the children. The girl

4795794c-59f6-408a-864b-b72adbf401f3-1
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.201
has fallen to the ground and the
boy is trying to balance on one

4795794c-59f6-408a-864b-b72adbf401f3-2
00:26:07.201 --> 00:26:11.431
foot as he's taken aback and
there's a big purple Phoenix

4795794c-59f6-408a-864b-b72adbf401f3-3
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:14.130
flying overhead. The boy is
holding.

e5de94d6-65fa-4de5-8f7b-687a9e0b2b4c-0
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:20.585
A purple something cylinder
thing. It could be a crayon in

e5de94d6-65fa-4de5-8f7b-687a9e0b2b4c-1
00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:25.960
his hand and the girl is holding
a red crayon thing in her hand

e5de94d6-65fa-4de5-8f7b-687a9e0b2b4c-2
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:31.167
and the wizard is holding an
orange crayon thing in his hand.

e5de94d6-65fa-4de5-8f7b-687a9e0b2b4c-3
00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:36.123
He's also wearing orangish
brownish robes and the crown is

e5de94d6-65fa-4de5-8f7b-687a9e0b2b4c-4
00:26:36.123 --> 00:26:41.162
orange and he's holding a paper
out to the children. Or the

e5de94d6-65fa-4de5-8f7b-687a9e0b2b4c-5
00:26:41.162 --> 00:26:44.690
diagram of a 2 banded circle
with 123456.

05ed73b8-065f-4bb2-bb3e-c75dd64988f2-0
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.514
Circles intersecting the big two
banded circle and they are

05ed73b8-065f-4bb2-bb3e-c75dd64988f2-1
00:26:50.514 --> 00:26:55.500
different colors green, blue,
purple, red, orange and yellow.

d407b719-2c1b-4365-895f-e806ac3a129e-0
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.970
We also get a close up of the
artwork and the tiles around the

d407b719-2c1b-4365-895f-e806ac3a129e-1
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:08.342
door and they look like the
statues that were just outside.

d407b719-2c1b-4365-895f-e806ac3a129e-2
00:27:08.342 --> 00:27:13.714
There's a mermaid statue and
also a picture of this king or

d407b719-2c1b-4365-895f-e806ac3a129e-3
00:27:13.714 --> 00:27:19.176
wizard and there's also a an
octopus kind of motif embracing

d407b719-2c1b-4365-895f-e806ac3a129e-4
00:27:19.176 --> 00:27:20.430
the open door.

122ba56a-4363-44c8-b20b-829580c532c4-0
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.640
On the next page.

fbfccb74-d852-49e8-9615-8a080252c644-0
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.900
The King or wizard has taken.

ce74f792-df05-4dc7-94a1-4f4a0f29fe62-0
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.726
He had a sash on. I'm not sure
if it was to hold ammunition,

ce74f792-df05-4dc7-94a1-4f4a0f29fe62-1
00:27:34.726 --> 00:27:38.920
but he's put it around the girl
across one shoulder.

debc05e3-0dc5-4e16-97cc-cdec17bef3ac-0
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.520
And.

3e8cf27a-f3e9-43d0-91c6-04cbfe366e4f-0
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.482
The Phoenix, the Purple Phoenix
is sitting on the shoulder of

3e8cf27a-f3e9-43d0-91c6-04cbfe366e4f-1
00:27:45.482 --> 00:27:48.860
the boy, and the boy is holding
the diagram and.

8176e4e0-dc09-4ac0-b914-ff088740cfa4-0
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.240
The wizard King is pointing to
the diagram.

d335a0ef-dd55-4fd3-8db4-23f36e22397d-0
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.880
The next picture down.

33d81e8d-09dc-46f3-99d8-ae75de128d14-0
00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.250
There are two.

31d467bc-23bb-4526-9338-bccab3a85bd3-0
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.360
Looks like armed guards with.

0d90facd-3b0f-4ebd-8d0a-e20a6138ae65-0
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.367
Armor and Spears coming through
the door and beginning to poke

0d90facd-3b0f-4ebd-8d0a-e20a6138ae65-1
00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:11.020
the wizard king, and he's lost
his orange crayon, and the boy

0d90facd-3b0f-4ebd-8d0a-e20a6138ae65-2
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.923
and the girl are a little
unsettled, and the purple

0d90facd-3b0f-4ebd-8d0a-e20a6138ae65-3
00:28:14.923 --> 00:28:17.700
phoenix is fluttering above the
boy.

d8354724-9a51-4793-9745-5aef10c1c2f8-0
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.413
And the next picture down, the
guards have taken the wizard

d8354724-9a51-4793-9745-5aef10c1c2f8-1
00:28:22.413 --> 00:28:26.396
King back into the door, and
he's reaching out to them in a

d8354724-9a51-4793-9745-5aef10c1c2f8-2
00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:30.513
kind of beseeching way. And the
boy and the girl are crouched

d8354724-9a51-4793-9745-5aef10c1c2f8-3
00:28:30.513 --> 00:28:32.039
down, huddled together.

e045379e-59f2-4a9b-ba3d-cb04c1b492f6-0
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.569
Looking at him while the Phoenix
lights again on the boy's

e045379e-59f2-4a9b-ba3d-cb04c1b492f6-1
00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:37.140
shoulder.

8abbe953-3284-4f79-bc80-d47c92c134bd-0
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.429
The next two pages, the first
page, the boy and the girl are

8abbe953-3284-4f79-bc80-d47c92c134bd-1
00:28:45.429 --> 00:28:48.610
looking at the door that is now
closed.

6ec44852-669b-45a6-8784-5e3fa43a9bee-0
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:54.278
And the girl has picked up the
orange crayon and has put it in

6ec44852-669b-45a6-8784-5e3fa43a9bee-1
00:28:54.278 --> 00:28:58.866
the sash around her in one of
the holders. And the boy has

6ec44852-669b-45a6-8784-5e3fa43a9bee-2
00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:03.610
curled up the diagram and is
holding it in one hand. And the

6ec44852-669b-45a6-8784-5e3fa43a9bee-3
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:08.509
purple Phoenix is still on his
shoulder, and there are still a

6ec44852-669b-45a6-8784-5e3fa43a9bee-4
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:10.219
few raindrops showing.

ab297ab6-cdbf-40e6-99f1-f532a7952682-0
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.270
Outside the archway.

3b68a8e8-37be-458f-9ee7-80949e9659ce-0
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.360
The next page has three separate
pictures.

8105b9d7-6fd1-46d7-b0bf-a85f80fa07ab-0
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.830
1.

ce6a4005-411d-45cc-af5a-05bad23e3e4e-0
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.060
The girl is using her red crayon
to draw.

bb7bb08b-e3a1-4980-8707-146c90bafa04-0
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.208
Something on the wall and the
boy is also drawing something on

bb7bb08b-e3a1-4980-8707-146c90bafa04-1
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:33.732
the floor and in the next
picture it looks like they have

bb7bb08b-e3a1-4980-8707-146c90bafa04-2
00:29:33.732 --> 00:29:36.710
each drawn a key that they were
able to pick up.

2ffb9298-c003-4568-b074-0fc5a9e41ba8-0
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:42.202
So this looks like magic crayons
or magic chalk and the Phoenix

2ffb9298-c003-4568-b074-0fc5a9e41ba8-1
00:29:42.202 --> 00:29:46.913
is still present in each of the
pictures watching on and then

2ffb9298-c003-4568-b074-0fc5a9e41ba8-2
00:29:46.913 --> 00:29:51.623
with the two keys the children
are able to open the doors and

2ffb9298-c003-4568-b074-0fc5a9e41ba8-3
00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:56.334
they are now entering the open
doors into a dark area and the

2ffb9298-c003-4568-b074-0fc5a9e41ba8-4
00:29:56.334 --> 00:29:58.690
Phoenix is flying in with them.

56aa0045-74a7-411a-96fb-0d6331722612-0
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:07.026
The next two pages is a
comprehensive spread showing a

56aa0045-74a7-411a-96fb-0d6331722612-1
00:30:07.026 --> 00:30:07.680
castle.

0b72955f-fdcc-4281-9de4-4f5e59842e2a-0
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:14.575
Surrounded by a Moat, the
children have emerged from the

0b72955f-fdcc-4281-9de4-4f5e59842e2a-1
00:30:14.575 --> 00:30:16.090
other side and.

fabe4d49-fb2d-4c53-a306-05d9aea753ef-0
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.270
There's a big.

151ab144-635f-4aec-a3fc-2cab672f7c04-0
00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:24.651
Wall, land, Earth, and it's like
they have tunneled through and

151ab144-635f-4aec-a3fc-2cab672f7c04-1
00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:28.947
then it opens up onto the Moat.
There's a little bit of a

151ab144-635f-4aec-a3fc-2cab672f7c04-2
00:30:28.947 --> 00:30:32.800
waterfall over them and they're
standing on a rock.

3f336e7b-ef97-4870-a34e-a3081c665eef-0
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.676
Looking at the castle and they
see on the other side of the

3f336e7b-ef97-4870-a34e-a3081c665eef-1
00:30:37.676 --> 00:30:41.862
Moat a paddle boat with the
wizard king and the Armed guards

3f336e7b-ef97-4870-a34e-a3081c665eef-2
00:30:41.862 --> 00:30:42.960
and some others.

fff525a9-4ff5-48ca-9059-0c411f7a2ee9-0
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.927
Perhaps they are slaves working
in the boat and they're going

fff525a9-4ff5-48ca-9059-0c411f7a2ee9-1
00:30:48.927 --> 00:30:52.710
through a big gated entrance
into the castle.

a1f3ff5b-34f7-4f55-a1fe-7688b275a7c0-0
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:59.968
The castle has many turrets,
turrets and Spires and flags and

a1f3ff5b-34f7-4f55-a1fe-7688b275a7c0-1
00:30:59.968 --> 00:31:00.980
in the sky.

643eedc5-2113-4549-93a0-add72ce49def-0
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.200
Over the Moat, it's like
Zeppelins flying above.

29882440-f76f-43c9-8e40-d9d197412b91-0
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.770
And there's a guard standing at
one of the towers with a.

25cce795-8e20-4e5e-b406-c691ea3c04fa-0
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.200
Spear.

fdc358cd-cdf0-4afe-8c70-888e87e10a1d-0
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.260
OK, on the next two pages there
are two images on one.

8e477b8e-a320-4299-b921-75ee905d98ec-0
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.510
The boy and the girl were close
up on them at the rock with the

8e477b8e-a320-4299-b921-75ee905d98ec-1
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.290
waterfall behind them and a
slightly different angle,

8e477b8e-a320-4299-b921-75ee905d98ec-2
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.420
getting a better view of the
paddle boat going through the

8e477b8e-a320-4299-b921-75ee905d98ec-3
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.550
archway that looks like it might
be going to the open sea.

0d8e74bd-c90c-4e8a-9058-68e71f0bd90f-0
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.700
And on top of the archway.

9010c99f-9a43-4c19-adf8-30166b484e61-0
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.925
It looks like some Viking ships.
You don't know why they're up

9010c99f-9a43-4c19-adf8-30166b484e61-1
00:31:48.925 --> 00:31:50.760
there with people in them.

412d23f5-8eda-459f-bc28-2210d7543273-0
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:56.824
It also looks like there might
be some fires bursting out from

412d23f5-8eda-459f-bc28-2210d7543273-1
00:31:56.824 --> 00:31:59.070
different parts of the castle.

23312876-9bc9-48e7-966c-007c2437a290-0
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.510
With flames and smoke wafting
upwards into the sky.

e630a0bf-f66d-4972-a10a-eb6c4bd87527-0
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.477
On the next page we have a close
up of the diagram that the boy

e630a0bf-f66d-4972-a10a-eb6c4bd87527-1
00:32:12.477 --> 00:32:17.029
is holding and he's pointing to
the yellow circle which is

e630a0bf-f66d-4972-a10a-eb6c4bd87527-2
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:21.735
showing the image of what looks
like, you know, a Greek or a

e630a0bf-f66d-4972-a10a-eb6c4bd87527-3
00:32:21.735 --> 00:32:22.970
Roman structure.

b00c302f-43ac-461d-ab39-da3a4b7ee7fe-0
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.300
You know with columns.

a71dc6da-4320-4246-ba93-5e959b5e14ff-0
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.430
And it looks like a map.

0cb25ecd-19ac-4b69-baa4-24a4127f0186-0
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.850
On the next page.

781662c2-2299-4c16-903f-11434b8c4add-0
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:41.480
The boy and the girl are still
on the rock on the far side of

781662c2-2299-4c16-903f-11434b8c4add-1
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.590
the Moat with the waterfall.

34146f72-3d2a-496b-8417-604bcb0b2377-0
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:50.900
Falling behind them, and now
those Viking ships are in the

34146f72-3d2a-496b-8417-604bcb0b2377-1
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.420
Moat, about to pass by them.

ce998f34-643b-469e-ab7c-8fa59a1664a2-0
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:59.035
And they the front boat has one
person dressed and looks like

ce998f34-643b-469e-ab7c-8fa59a1664a2-1
00:32:59.035 --> 00:33:04.187
golden armor or clothing with a
horned helmet, and there are two

ce998f34-643b-469e-ab7c-8fa59a1664a2-2
00:33:04.187 --> 00:33:09.023
armed guards, and the other
boats have other armed guards in

ce998f34-643b-469e-ab7c-8fa59a1664a2-3
00:33:09.023 --> 00:33:09.420
them.

fa2e0fc4-678f-4555-aaad-90acc1243676-0
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:15.700
And they're moving with Poles
pushing through the Moat.

910dde25-95f9-4b04-8169-b1147e7fe373-0
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.079
And yes, it definitely looks
like there's fire coming from

910dde25-95f9-4b04-8169-b1147e7fe373-1
00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:23.110
different areas of the castle in
the background.

5bd12e2a-f339-407d-ad85-62b339713b5f-0
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.078
On the next page there are three
separate images. The boy and the

5bd12e2a-f339-407d-ad85-62b339713b5f-1
00:33:29.078 --> 00:33:33.220
girl on the rock are holding up
the red and the green crayons.

1ceee8a0-211a-4672-a34d-af1b3ef9b8ee-0
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.766
And in the next picture, the
girl is drawing has drawn swim

1ceee8a0-211a-4672-a34d-af1b3ef9b8ee-1
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:40.640
flippers onto her feet.

89a03b3f-c4cb-4658-969e-cc29ff6c61f0-0
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.040
And.

cac35fd3-f2d6-44e0-98ee-ae95a67f1845-0
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.474
A circle that at first looked
like a baseball, but then I'm

cac35fd3-f2d6-44e0-98ee-ae95a67f1845-1
00:33:46.474 --> 00:33:48.740
thinking might be a diving
helmet and.

8b020525-ece2-4a42-81a0-1718e8c86c3f-0
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.320
And an air tank.

a13e5035-ab46-4f4d-9b23-e86270e1f4ae-0
00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:58.300
And the boy with the purple is
drawing octopus tentacles.

ba0f2741-e93d-47c4-aea6-bfcfbca0c57c-0
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.910
And then in the final picture.

6a04e3c3-cf6d-4e99-94f2-b60005f17b72-0
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.450
They have both dived into the
water. You can see their legs

6a04e3c3-cf6d-4e99-94f2-b60005f17b72-1
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.334
with red flippers sticking out
and the octopus tentacles and

6a04e3c3-cf6d-4e99-94f2-b60005f17b72-2
00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:11.500
the tail feathers of the
phoenix.

71d168a1-e854-43c8-ba90-ff61a8d832e6-0
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.910
In the next picture we are
underwater and the picture

71d168a1-e854-43c8-ba90-ff61a8d832e6-1
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:18.680
spreads over the two pages.

bfa51065-296e-4888-bf8d-9ab2f0933172-0
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:24.012
And the octopus creature, they
are holding on to its tentacles,

bfa51065-296e-4888-bf8d-9ab2f0933172-1
00:34:24.012 --> 00:34:27.640
and it's taking them down
beneath the water into.

8f2455a1-fde3-4c9b-8722-4910d8c0e6d3-0
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.805
It looks like the Roman
Colosseum and in the center is a

8f2455a1-fde3-4c9b-8722-4910d8c0e6d3-1
00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:36.610
building that looks like the
picture on the map.

fd1e7ced-d8e3-477f-a632-db2a8d6e3945-0
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:45.842
On the next page, we see them
down in the midst and they're at

fd1e7ced-d8e3-477f-a632-db2a8d6e3945-1
00:34:45.842 --> 00:34:46.700
a little.

754960df-fb12-4100-946b-fe8bf9f6e2f3-0
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:56.566
Stand decorated with sculpted
seahorses and a sea fan or a

754960df-fb12-4100-946b-fe8bf9f6e2f3-1
00:34:56.566 --> 00:34:58.040
shell on top.

920f81b9-0ff8-4cd0-a5c2-b61e1c5e0d2b-0
00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.550


d37a1c3e-3d83-47ce-968b-c2e1d1587c3c-0
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.337
There are a few fish swimming by
and the boy and the girl do have

d37a1c3e-3d83-47ce-968b-c2e1d1587c3c-1
00:35:05.337 --> 00:35:09.310
their diving helmets and the air
tanks and the red flippers on.

c5b1cd9d-2849-47ae-a0e4-f61826b5160b-0
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.820
And.

517a4343-9208-4dde-a1a4-9f3fc538ffd8-0
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:18.036
Looks like the boy has reached
into the shell and perhaps has

517a4343-9208-4dde-a1a4-9f3fc538ffd8-1
00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:22.650
picked up a yellow crayon and
the next page.

d349d4e2-323d-4318-87aa-4a5f5903f185-0
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.770
The picture shows the girl
putting the red, the yellow

d349d4e2-323d-4318-87aa-4a5f5903f185-1
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.475
crayon into her belt, where it
now holds the red, the orange

d349d4e2-323d-4318-87aa-4a5f5903f185-2
00:35:31.475 --> 00:35:35.119
and the yellow, and then two
other open spaces and then the

d349d4e2-323d-4318-87aa-4a5f5903f185-3
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:38.642
purple crayon. The boy and the
girl are holding on to the

d349d4e2-323d-4318-87aa-4a5f5903f185-4
00:35:38.642 --> 00:35:39.250
tentacles.

afce4060-8792-4c5b-8f0a-d4c2b63ed6cf-0
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.160
And the map.

eb69e14b-d7ea-49a4-a8f4-d6798e99eda3-0
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:49.158
Even the purple Phoenix has an
air tank on its back, and they

eb69e14b-d7ea-49a4-a8f4-d6798e99eda3-1
00:35:49.158 --> 00:35:49.510
are.

02b43301-5983-4b5f-b0a4-6ca4762d8c8e-0
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.650
Being taken away, but they're
also being chased by underwater.

9c386618-fdb0-4ae2-8d1c-a7f97ba94af6-0
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.880
People with armor and Spears.

1cb3a6e2-c3d3-46a8-a307-45c7089375b8-0
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:09.448
And the next page the boy and
the girl are emerging out of the

1cb3a6e2-c3d3-46a8-a307-45c7089375b8-1
00:36:09.448 --> 00:36:10.360
water into.

3aac33d3-42ef-4563-8f8b-e2d4c97b8b04-0
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:17.053
Some land with palm trees on it,
and they're taking off their

3aac33d3-42ef-4563-8f8b-e2d4c97b8b04-1
00:36:17.053 --> 00:36:21.738
swim gear, leaving it on the
ground the bird is flying and

3aac33d3-42ef-4563-8f8b-e2d4c97b8b04-2
00:36:21.738 --> 00:36:25.630
then the next picture they're
beginning to draw.

d27656f9-d621-41e2-aa08-8ca2ae31715c-0
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.090
The outline of what might be a
large creature.

60036201-908a-45b7-9ec0-3068d5c3f3a4-0
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.120
And we'll have to wait till the
next page to see what it is.

34f81ad2-8697-4dbc-ac11-17b570f5bd63-0
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:42.462
Yes. On the next page we see
them sitting on top of a purple

34f81ad2-8697-4dbc-ac11-17b570f5bd63-1
00:36:42.462 --> 00:36:44.400
rhinoceros with a red.

c4416be7-5801-4c2b-b078-10d868db6492-0
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.320
Thing on its back that they are
sitting in and it.

8135fc49-bf29-4ae3-9fbc-20407ea34a59-0
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:57.442
Has a cover over them and
they're going through it looks

8135fc49-bf29-4ae3-9fbc-20407ea34a59-1
00:36:57.442 --> 00:37:03.014
like a jungle and there are some
statues with beings with wings

8135fc49-bf29-4ae3-9fbc-20407ea34a59-2
00:37:03.014 --> 00:37:08.586
and then you continue down this
path through the forest and get

8135fc49-bf29-4ae3-9fbc-20407ea34a59-3
00:37:08.586 --> 00:37:13.897
to some pyramid type structures
that look more like Aztec or

8135fc49-bf29-4ae3-9fbc-20407ea34a59-4
00:37:13.897 --> 00:37:14.420
Mayan.

0b5e900f-1f84-4544-8504-1cc3380ab3e4-0
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.570
Blocky.

958642f1-2d05-470c-a400-9b286a190f62-0
00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:24.190
Pyramids rather than Egyptian
pyramids on the next page.

4def4aef-ac13-43a9-92d0-b406f1e74678-0
00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.970
We're looking out over the
water.

6755e7c0-67d6-4165-87ef-6f799ff543fe-0
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.940
It's like a Cove or a Bay.

a9ed4bd2-8aa2-407d-a3b8-aab032f6becf-0
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.220
And.

acc2abb7-7427-412e-b3c8-0060d28002d9-0
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:42.192
Just beyond them in the cove or
the Bay is a structure rising

acc2abb7-7427-412e-b3c8-0060d28002d9-1
00:37:42.192 --> 00:37:47.750
up, and it's again a blocky kind
of pyramid with steps.

d5fd1f2a-58a1-4635-8c2a-4a3a1e8a5f50-0
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.590
And levels and it looks like
there's a rickety.

be1ddde5-5d3e-49a5-8ad3-d2d3a98a4f09-0
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.970
Rope bridge from the land to the
tower.

2d3e0569-8ff7-4e13-ae20-8c03a4e8540b-0
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.630
We will see what the next page
brings.

beea3c3f-3392-4e3d-b300-3fbde2f3ee19-0
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.772
Ah yes. The boy and the girl are
crossing the rope bridge and it

beea3c3f-3392-4e3d-b300-3fbde2f3ee19-1
00:38:07.772 --> 00:38:11.790
does look rickety with parts of
rope hanging off of it.

c598b804-4505-453d-9a7a-7dced5d7be56-0
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.030
Um.

6d62eaeb-ddc4-4375-b1c5-7dad45dc8d6e-0
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.675
And the Phoenix is flying across
with them and they are going

6d62eaeb-ddc4-4375-b1c5-7dad45dc8d6e-1
00:38:19.675 --> 00:38:24.570
across to the top of the tower
which has a light on the top.

3c27d093-2f4b-4575-ae63-6e47670cd4fa-0
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:32.290
On the next page, the boy and
the girl have gone all the way

3c27d093-2f4b-4575-ae63-6e47670cd4fa-1
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.246
across and they've climbed to
the top of the tower to the

3c27d093-2f4b-4575-ae63-6e47670cd4fa-2
00:38:36.246 --> 00:38:40.270
light. And Oh no, the armored
guards are chasing them with

3c27d093-2f4b-4575-ae63-6e47670cd4fa-3
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:44.498
their Spears coming across the
rope bridge and the Phoenix is

3c27d093-2f4b-4575-ae63-6e47670cd4fa-4
00:38:44.498 --> 00:38:45.590
flying overhead.

808d2454-815e-479d-bd39-fb857dc67a03-0
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.060
In the next picture, the boy and
the girl are using their red and

808d2454-815e-479d-bd39-fb857dc67a03-1
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.370
purple crayons to draw some
other objects.

32960ccb-b46e-4891-9720-3e52155dda95-0
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.830
Let's see what they are on the
next page.

e81e43ce-28c9-4bb9-9c43-3c370e66a41a-0
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:04.609
Ah, on the next page they're
sitting on a red swing attached

e81e43ce-28c9-4bb9-9c43-3c370e66a41a-1
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:09.546
to a big purple dragonfly that
is flying them away from the

e81e43ce-28c9-4bb9-9c43-3c370e66a41a-2
00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:14.236
armored guards that have been
chasing them, and they are

e81e43ce-28c9-4bb9-9c43-3c370e66a41a-3
00:39:14.236 --> 00:39:19.090
flying off, and in the distance
we see snowy mountains and

e81e43ce-28c9-4bb9-9c43-3c370e66a41a-4
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.299
another tower with a light at
the top.

bf9ca0ea-8f0e-4c65-80ff-0226f2c12675-0
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.220
And the next page the boy and
the girl are.

cd97e7ac-50d3-45aa-a45d-7fcab13cfc27-0
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:35.463
Being deposited by the dragonfly
onto the top of the next tower,

cd97e7ac-50d3-45aa-a45d-7fcab13cfc27-1
00:39:35.463 --> 00:39:40.721
which is purple with a Buddha
sculpture on it. And there are

cd97e7ac-50d3-45aa-a45d-7fcab13cfc27-2
00:39:40.721 --> 00:39:46.066
Zeppelin aircraft following them
with more armored guards and

cd97e7ac-50d3-45aa-a45d-7fcab13cfc27-3
00:39:46.066 --> 00:39:46.669
Spears.

a0e92859-bfc4-42f8-8887-00f052fad0fc-0
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:54.912
In the next picture, the girl is
showing her sash full of a

a0e92859-bfc4-42f8-8887-00f052fad0fc-1
00:39:54.912 --> 00:39:59.120
rainbow of crayons purple green
blue

9985f9e1-4299-4b12-8d38-fb445b724c16-0
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.696
And then a green yellow and a
yellow and an orange and a red

9985f9e1-4299-4b12-8d38-fb445b724c16-1
00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:07.520
and she's smiling and.

e257b8f7-c425-4a8a-bdd5-ab471777320d-0
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.290
The next page.

5e0c6385-7329-4dcd-bd05-58703ee875b7-0
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:16.405
Shows the armored guards and the
Zeppelin aircraft approaching.

5e0c6385-7329-4dcd-bd05-58703ee875b7-1
00:40:16.405 --> 00:40:21.516
They're reaching for the purple
Phoenix and one of the guards

5e0c6385-7329-4dcd-bd05-58703ee875b7-2
00:40:21.516 --> 00:40:23.000
has a golden cage.

ccbfc00c-1897-425f-b2f8-ed1b3d1cbd71-0
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.040
In the next picture.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.564
I don't see the boy and the
girl. We have a close up of one

137957a9-4e56-4538-a6c7-567c1642d939-1
00:40:32.564 --> 00:40:36.409
of the zeppelin aircraft with
the guards in it, and then we

137957a9-4e56-4538-a6c7-567c1642d939-2
00:40:36.409 --> 00:40:40.318
see a couple of the others in
the distance. We don't see the

137957a9-4e56-4538-a6c7-567c1642d939-3
00:40:40.318 --> 00:40:43.329
boy and the girl and we don't
see the phoenix.

c6554c22-f8c9-4734-8d26-140e89665867-0
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.680
In the next picture.

709125a7-172c-4e61-bf73-1da0d70aa2bb-0
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.056
It's wonderful. There's a huge
rainbow reaching from the top of

709125a7-172c-4e61-bf73-1da0d70aa2bb-1
00:40:52.056 --> 00:40:54.480
the tower where the boy and the
girl were.

e9324e14-d34d-490d-8b62-0ac954922920-0
00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:00.921
To the Phoenix, which is flying
off with the sash, with the

e9324e14-d34d-490d-8b62-0ac954922920-1
00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:06.490
colored crayons creating the
rainbow path across the sky.

5444810c-6db8-44e1-89cf-957b655c7b39-0
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.855
And to one to the left side is
one of the Zeppelin aircraft

5444810c-6db8-44e1-89cf-957b655c7b39-1
00:41:11.855 --> 00:41:16.486
with the guards in it, and one
is holding his fist up in the

5444810c-6db8-44e1-89cf-957b655c7b39-2
00:41:16.486 --> 00:41:16.790
air.

8915e9f7-3e64-4e0b-9d59-d38298e2c3fd-0
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:22.572
Apparently cursing, he has been
foiled. And the boy and the

8915e9f7-3e64-4e0b-9d59-d38298e2c3fd-1
00:41:22.572 --> 00:41:25.800
girl. The boy is smiling and in
another.

8d4e709e-0557-473a-8c83-aa10eaf18d5b-0
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.725
Aspect of the page. There's
another Zeppelin aircraft which

8d4e709e-0557-473a-8c83-aa10eaf18d5b-1
00:41:30.725 --> 00:41:34.291
seems to be falling from the
sky, and then another Zeppelin

8d4e709e-0557-473a-8c83-aa10eaf18d5b-2
00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.550
aircraft is also falling. It's,
it's.

d0922bca-191c-4217-ab7a-03c62e84ed03-0
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.057
It's turned sideways and falling
down, and one of the guards is

d0922bca-191c-4217-ab7a-03c62e84ed03-1
00:41:42.057 --> 00:41:45.290
still holding the golden cage
and in the distance.

02fdc431-66a3-4a42-b609-513086a5bcbd-0
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.960
We see.

01c39b4b-5c8e-46b8-b056-7e6bf5b0d4e1-0
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.180
A Kingdom with lots of.

9c632f11-0a90-45c1-8ee2-a1b61be65dbc-0
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.670
Buildings built out of stone.

4095b031-3219-4eeb-a306-78fbeaacfe46-0
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.350
The next two pages are complete
spread.

79c6494c-e0bd-45d6-a206-958b2502cbac-0
00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.580
In the foreground we see a
river.

0928aede-57b1-40ae-89de-1ef5a98629d8-0
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:07.610
And there's a boat in the
foreground.

ac995749-f7cb-43cd-b053-ec2136ae5e4d-0
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.782
And the people in it, ah, the
wizard king is there, and his

ac995749-f7cb-43cd-b053-ec2136ae5e4d-1
00:42:12.782 --> 00:42:17.449
hands are thrown up into the air
exultantly. And the other people

ac995749-f7cb-43cd-b053-ec2136ae5e4d-2
00:42:17.449 --> 00:42:21.692
that look like maybe they were
prisoners or slaves working,

ac995749-f7cb-43cd-b053-ec2136ae5e4d-3
00:42:21.692 --> 00:42:26.005
they're also celebrating. And
the guards are falling off the

ac995749-f7cb-43cd-b053-ec2136ae5e4d-4
00:42:26.005 --> 00:42:28.410
boat into the water. The
rainbow.

baab7251-e782-4b4e-9f9c-a72a581e6ce0-0
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.524
That it was starting from the
left side, from the top of the

baab7251-e782-4b4e-9f9c-a72a581e6ce0-1
00:42:33.524 --> 00:42:34.930
tower across the sky.

d0a01a83-9ae9-4cc6-9f16-823fcd90d6a2-0
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:40.862
Lands in the boat and there's
the purple Phoenix with the sash

d0a01a83-9ae9-4cc6-9f16-823fcd90d6a2-1
00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:45.369
and the colored crayons flying
to one side, and in the

d0a01a83-9ae9-4cc6-9f16-823fcd90d6a2-2
00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:47.500
background is the Kingdom.

f30ab772-f068-4e2e-bf1f-e973a3e57cc6-0
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:55.319
The next page is also a full two
page spread, with the Kingdom

f30ab772-f068-4e2e-bf1f-e973a3e57cc6-1
00:42:55.319 --> 00:43:00.273
illuminated with the rainbow in
the sky and glowing golden

f30ab772-f068-4e2e-bf1f-e973a3e57cc6-2
00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:03.800
colors on the stone walls of the
Kingdom.

c06e86c2-56e4-417b-ab48-081fdcd05ea4-0
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.897
The boy and the girl are again
on top, riding on top of the

c06e86c2-56e4-417b-ab48-081fdcd05ea4-1
00:43:10.897 --> 00:43:15.682
purple rhinoceros in the paddle
boat on the river. And there are

c06e86c2-56e4-417b-ab48-081fdcd05ea4-2
00:43:15.682 --> 00:43:19.658
other boats in the river, and
you can see some of the

c06e86c2-56e4-417b-ab48-081fdcd05ea4-3
00:43:19.658 --> 00:43:24.370
tentacles of the purple creature
flailing above the water, but.

deaa7244-61bc-42ab-9a17-72f9d7539d10-0
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.170
Just not in distress. And there
are people in another boat on

deaa7244-61bc-42ab-9a17-72f9d7539d10-1
00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.220
the water. It looks like they're
playing musical instruments.

842a8cb0-247c-4ee6-9339-e0577faac179-0
00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.290
And the purple Phoenix is flying
by.

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-0
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:44.498
In the next picture, the boy and
the girl and the boat and the

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-1
00:43:44.498 --> 00:43:48.955
purple rhinoceros are back by
the rock by the entrance to the

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-2
00:43:48.955 --> 00:43:53.556
tunnel, and they're getting off
it with the wizard king walking

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-3
00:43:53.556 --> 00:43:58.229
down some steps. The boy is down
on the rock, the wizard King is

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-4
00:43:58.229 --> 00:44:02.901
on the steps, and he's reaching
his hand to help the girl off of

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-5
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:07.502
the rhinoceros. Onto the steps,
and the rainbow is still in the

0afe8089-9e23-421d-abc5-c76213339e2f-6
00:44:07.502 --> 00:44:07.789
sky.

0e37284b-cef8-468f-ae6e-b7eadc8bb551-0
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.510
With the Kingdom in the
background.

43ee010c-7213-49e9-82bd-2fc61c2f3441-0
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.940
And the purple dragonfly in the
distance in the sky and the.

125b3927-634f-4c0b-ab66-4792efd8782b-0
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.353
Purple tentacle waving from the
water. The next page has three

125b3927-634f-4c0b-ab66-4792efd8782b-1
00:44:22.353 --> 00:44:26.952
little images on it. The boy and
the girl are standing by the

125b3927-634f-4c0b-ab66-4792efd8782b-2
00:44:26.952 --> 00:44:30.290
tunnel entrance and the wizard
King has the.

fecf9556-d902-4a51-b589-118f5deadc14-0
00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.198
Orange Crayon and it's drawing
something jagged. And in the

fecf9556-d902-4a51-b589-118f5deadc14-1
00:44:35.198 --> 00:44:39.484
next picture we see that he has
drawn a crown and is placing it

fecf9556-d902-4a51-b589-118f5deadc14-2
00:44:39.484 --> 00:44:40.690
on the boy's head.

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-0
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:45.343
And the phoenix is with him, and
the boy is kneeling down as he

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-1
00:44:45.343 --> 00:44:49.055
receives the crown on his head.
And then the third and final

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-2
00:44:49.055 --> 00:44:52.766
picture on the page. The girl
also has a golden crown on her

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-3
00:44:52.766 --> 00:44:56.538
head. They're waving goodbye to
the wizard king as he has his

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-4
00:44:56.538 --> 00:45:00.310
hands held together in front of
his face in a salute to them,

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-5
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.204
apparently bidding them farewell
as they enter into the tunnel.

0aaf907e-94b4-4e73-a712-323bdc448472-6
00:45:04.204 --> 00:45:06.760
And the purple Phoenix is with
them also.

8e00fb97-171d-4a49-948c-44f4b1c9d3b7-0
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:13.670
In the final picture, we're back
in the city in the Archway.

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-0
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.232
The rain has stopped.
There are puddles on the ground,

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-1
00:45:19.232 --> 00:45:23.899
on the paved ground. The door is
open. The boy and the girl had

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-2
00:45:23.899 --> 00:45:28.274
emerged and they're looking at
the modern day city. They're

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-3
00:45:28.274 --> 00:45:32.723
still holding the purple and the
red crayon. They still have

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-4
00:45:32.723 --> 00:45:37.171
their golden crowns. There's a
rainbow over the city and the

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-5
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:41.546
purple Phoenix is with them in
the sky. #END_quest OK, that was good.

02ddf50d-5b3d-4c47-be25-50f9998049ba-6
00:45:41.546 --> 00:45:43.879
That was a fun story. That was.

c7f6cca3-e5bb-4c0a-a160-4ba5e1ac5f58-0
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:45.690
Yeah.

4fdb7031-5778-489c-aa17-5cabf242b4a4-0
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.740
OK. So then going on to the
next one, it's another part of

4fdb7031-5778-489c-aa17-5cabf242b4a4-1
00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.090
the graphic novel.

800adcf9-4719-4b84-bbd2-cb298745dc42-0
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:55.540
OK.

264c64c6-3725-4319-b032-9b16b39bb4ac-0
00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.340
Stretch, yeah.

b58a167f-6e72-49a8-a57a-c4b8266c577c-0
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.330
Hey, graphic novel.

38ffb438-44be-4c73-b44f-a1045d44a5ff-0
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.350
#START_arrival_1 We have a page
with.

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-0
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:10.399
9 squares of close up pictures
in a grid three by three. The

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-1
00:46:10.399 --> 00:46:15.225
first square is a close up of a
family portrait with a man or

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-2
00:46:15.225 --> 00:46:19.819
woman and a child between them
on a mantle piece. The next

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-3
00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:24.256
picture a hand has reached out
and is holding the framed

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-4
00:46:24.256 --> 00:46:29.317
picture and is lifting it off of
the mantle piece. And the third

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-5
00:46:29.317 --> 00:46:34.066
picture the hand is taking the
framed picture and is putting

b1e33f19-ed3a-4eaf-9a18-9290564b5c24-6
00:46:34.066 --> 00:46:34.300
it.

bedf2069-61f7-49c8-a2bb-09b7ccbf1f9a-0
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.050
Is wrapping it up.

ed0411e4-f77c-455d-ae68-62f0702f27d7-0
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:41.545
And in the next picture we see
the package is all wrapped up

ed0411e4-f77c-455d-ae68-62f0702f27d7-1
00:46:41.545 --> 00:46:46.430
and is being tied together with
string with the hands tying the

ed0411e4-f77c-455d-ae68-62f0702f27d7-2
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.010
string. The next picture the
hands are holding the package.

bf7bce5e-737b-4b05-9a4d-ebbb8c3b3c60-0
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:56.637
And then the next picture, the
hands are closing what looks

bf7bce5e-737b-4b05-9a4d-ebbb8c3b3c60-1
00:46:56.637 --> 00:47:01.463
like a suitcase. So perhaps the
packaged picture is in the

bf7bce5e-737b-4b05-9a4d-ebbb8c3b3c60-2
00:47:01.463 --> 00:47:02.200
suitcase.

0680c8a6-c4f1-4934-9a6a-32c96c2a246c-0
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.120
In the next picture.

6c42d587-c6f5-400d-af6d-4c44ecfa5843-0
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.390
The hand is holding.

543e405f-73b7-4c78-91c6-b0ca2bf1bac5-0
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:13.496
A strap? So maybe it's securing
the suitcase closed. Yes, in the

543e405f-73b7-4c78-91c6-b0ca2bf1bac5-1
00:47:13.496 --> 00:47:18.267
next picture there's one hand
resting on the secured belt

543e405f-73b7-4c78-91c6-b0ca2bf1bac5-2
00:47:18.267 --> 00:47:22.710
around the suitcase and the last
picture on the page.

5d169166-bdd7-408e-8fb7-324172d5825f-0
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.472
The second hand is resting on
top of the first hand, on top of

5d169166-bdd7-408e-8fb7-324172d5825f-1
00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:28.930
the belt on the suitcase.

edaaf418-4a8d-4897-90e3-cb8c379f8ac3-0
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:36.357
On the next page there are also
nine small close-up pictures,

edaaf418-4a8d-4897-90e3-cb8c379f8ac3-1
00:47:36.357 --> 00:47:40.950
three by three. The first
picture has an origami bird.

447c0df1-2fc5-4ec8-97d5-af0ba48f72a5-0
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:47.010
The next picture has a close-up
of an old fashioned clock with

447c0df1-2fc5-4ec8-97d5-af0ba48f72a5-1
00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:51.421
Roman numerals on the face
showing 10 minutes after 10:00

447c0df1-2fc5-4ec8-97d5-af0ba48f72a5-2
00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:52.030
o'clock.

fadbbec0-42bd-4a6b-9a68-c3b0f68f2833-0
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.770
The next picture shows the hat
and the kerchief hanging from

fadbbec0-42bd-4a6b-9a68-c3b0f68f2833-1
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.880
hooks on the wall.

61c1baa9-8954-4a19-99fa-d78ef0215569-0
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.890
The next close up picture has a
cooking pot with a lid.

34da397a-b6d0-4748-bb05-099e94040f6f-0
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.080
Partially open and a stirring
spoon lying next to it.

fafcfb9f-7202-4ba7-b5bb-081e1f34e2e8-0
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.341
The next picture looks like a
child's drawing of a man and a

fafcfb9f-7202-4ba7-b5bb-081e1f34e2e8-1
00:48:17.341 --> 00:48:21.784
woman and a child smiling, with
a smiling son in the sky and a

fafcfb9f-7202-4ba7-b5bb-081e1f34e2e8-2
00:48:21.784 --> 00:48:23.900
bird resting on the man's arm.

ec327590-f397-4dad-a3d3-5f219ccf98f8-0
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.921
The next close up picture is a
tea kettle that has a crack in

ec327590-f397-4dad-a3d3-5f219ccf98f8-1
00:48:29.921 --> 00:48:32.570
it and steam coming out of the
spout.

27c6706e-601e-4dfd-9992-9e202ed61e63-0
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:39.040
Next close up picture looks like
a tea or a coffee.

a4654b91-41aa-4e49-849a-b21f2e796d80-0
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:45.505
Cup with little chip on it,
sitting in a saucer and some

a4654b91-41aa-4e49-849a-b21f2e796d80-1
00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:47.880
folded papers next to it.

1482aeaf-11a1-4489-8069-282dc2ed1694-0
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:55.298
The next close up picture has a
corner of a packing suitcase or

1482aeaf-11a1-4489-8069-282dc2ed1694-1
00:48:55.298 --> 00:48:58.190
trunk with folded items in it.

0a47ee52-1d03-4863-99fa-26d1a463ceff-0
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.372
And the next picture is the
picture of the man and the woman

0a47ee52-1d03-4863-99fa-26d1a463ceff-1
00:49:03.372 --> 00:49:04.380
and the child.

6d44a541-e13e-4135-afb5-94e7fc7472a9-0
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:10.356
The next page has one large
picture. It's the man and the

6d44a541-e13e-4135-afb5-94e7fc7472a9-1
00:49:10.356 --> 00:49:15.330
woman standing together at the
kitchen table with the suitcase.

f3fcfb2c-0945-4a23-b7d3-ac9fbb60e5e2-0
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:18.210
Closed on top of the table.

f3721d14-d295-47e4-9f8d-650c4cd61c65-0
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.070
There are two tier coffee cups
and the.

9ecdaa90-0ea3-498a-8cc8-66b712a4bb3a-0
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:28.906
It's the teak pot and the papers
and three chairs around the

9ecdaa90-0ea3-498a-8cc8-66b712a4bb3a-1
00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:29.390
table.

13aa0617-ee91-4a17-86db-c760c6e47159-0
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:34.810
The man and the woman are are
facing each other one his hand

13aa0617-ee91-4a17-86db-c760c6e47159-1
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:39.668
is on the suitcase and her hand
is on top of his. Their heads

13aa0617-ee91-4a17-86db-c760c6e47159-2
00:49:39.668 --> 00:49:44.213
are bowed a little bit and
they're they're shading in the

13aa0617-ee91-4a17-86db-c760c6e47159-3
00:49:44.213 --> 00:49:47.739
picture. I'm not sure if it's
sad or somber.

89fb00a8-7c08-4d7c-a004-248fa96cc21a-0
00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.740
And then behind them are the
other.

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-0
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:56.140
Decorations in the room on the
mantle piece that we had

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-1
00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:00.724
close-ups of on the other page.
The next page has 12 small

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-2
00:50:00.724 --> 00:50:05.307
square close-ups with the
progression. The first is on the

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-3
00:50:05.307 --> 00:50:10.435
picture of the child snuggled up
under her covers in bed. You can

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-4
00:50:10.435 --> 00:50:15.484
just see the top of her head and
the next picture the covers are

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-5
00:50:15.484 --> 00:50:19.990
coming down just showing her
eyes and nose and some light

44e09d06-d38a-4fb2-b373-860658bc4fda-6
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.700
illuminating her face.

a478a500-2c76-443e-a14c-784ec651a329-0
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.486
In the next picture, she's
sitting up, yawning with her

a478a500-2c76-443e-a14c-784ec651a329-1
00:50:25.486 --> 00:50:29.075
mouth open, and one hand is
rubbing her eye as the covers

a478a500-2c76-443e-a14c-784ec651a329-2
00:50:29.075 --> 00:50:30.190
come further down.

057d1112-d278-4c23-ad74-3c6399a391b2-0
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.188
The next picture, she's sitting
at the table with a bowl of

057d1112-d278-4c23-ad74-3c6399a391b2-1
00:50:35.188 --> 00:50:37.790
porridge or cereal, holding a
spoon.

bd8473f6-8fb3-4155-96d5-821c61945cf3-0
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.100
And the next picture is a close
up of her with her cereal and

bd8473f6-8fb3-4155-96d5-821c61945cf3-1
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.184
spoon and she's looking off to
the other side. And the next

bd8473f6-8fb3-4155-96d5-821c61945cf3-2
00:50:47.184 --> 00:50:51.200
picture has a picture of the
suitcase closed and strapped.

c112579a-11f0-4383-859a-b3467bb114df-0
00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:56.191
The next picture is a close up
of the man's head. He's putting

c112579a-11f0-4383-859a-b3467bb114df-1
00:50:56.191 --> 00:50:56.740
a hat on.

6bfa9e03-8ec8-413c-b35c-2721ec824dff-0
00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:02.646
The next picture is the woman's
head putting a scarf on and the

6bfa9e03-8ec8-413c-b35c-2721ec824dff-1
00:51:02.646 --> 00:51:07.265
next picture is the girl putting
on a hat and I think her

6bfa9e03-8ec8-413c-b35c-2721ec824dff-2
00:51:07.265 --> 00:51:11.804
mother's hands reaching to
fasten her coat. And the next

6bfa9e03-8ec8-413c-b35c-2721ec824dff-3
00:51:11.804 --> 00:51:16.422
picture the little girl is
putting on boots, and the next

6bfa9e03-8ec8-413c-b35c-2721ec824dff-4
00:51:16.422 --> 00:51:20.643
picture the little girl is
holding the handle of the

6bfa9e03-8ec8-413c-b35c-2721ec824dff-5
00:51:20.643 --> 00:51:21.360
suitcase.

43a7086b-4938-458d-a0b4-f053c0b8cae3-0
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:27.620
Looking, looking up expectantly,
and then the next picture. The

43a7086b-4938-458d-a0b4-f053c0b8cae3-1
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:31.870
man is reaching down as if to
take the suitcase.

7e8d730d-ade0-4370-b682-338a149d1ad7-0
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:38.309
The next page is 1 big picture,
with a Stonewall and the shadow

7e8d730d-ade0-4370-b682-338a149d1ad7-1
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:43.389
of what I imagine is a Dragon's
tale with spikes coming off of

7e8d730d-ade0-4370-b682-338a149d1ad7-2
00:51:43.389 --> 00:51:48.387
it. The man, the woman, and the
child have apparently emerged

7e8d730d-ade0-4370-b682-338a149d1ad7-3
00:51:48.387 --> 00:51:53.225
from a doorway and some steps in
the Stonewall, and they're

7e8d730d-ade0-4370-b682-338a149d1ad7-4
00:51:53.225 --> 00:51:53.870
walking.

e321f47e-12e3-4649-a05a-c4cc24b213c9-0
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.570
Down the street, the man is
holding the suitcase, the girl

e321f47e-12e3-4649-a05a-c4cc24b213c9-1
00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:02.070
is next to him and the mother is
on the other side.

91a04656-c74d-4fd4-96c6-2a26a07ab29f-0
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.750
So the next page has three small
close-ups.

d9b24a99-206d-4478-bf95-fea15140f781-0
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.310
At the top of the page of the
little girl's face.

dd2d31d5-254d-4469-8e6b-eec5661afc06-0
00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:17.110
Just round looking expectant.

39ce84dd-c611-422e-96fb-6941164035da-0
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:23.745
Perhaps sad, perhaps questioning
the next picture on the page is

39ce84dd-c611-422e-96fb-6941164035da-1
00:52:23.745 --> 00:52:28.892
a larger picture. We see a steam
locomotive approaching and

39ce84dd-c611-422e-96fb-6941164035da-2
00:52:28.892 --> 00:52:34.125
people scattered on the side
with different bags and waiting

39ce84dd-c611-422e-96fb-6941164035da-3
00:52:34.125 --> 00:52:39.272
for the train. And at the bottom
of the page are three more

39ce84dd-c611-422e-96fb-6941164035da-4
00:52:39.272 --> 00:52:43.647
little close up pictures.
There's the girl and her

39ce84dd-c611-422e-96fb-6941164035da-5
00:52:43.647 --> 00:52:48.279
father's hand is on her
shoulder, perhaps reassuring.

847c7526-dec1-4a63-8a82-8ccab90bfd19-0
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:53.709
The next picture there he is
leaning over to her, lifting the

847c7526-dec1-4a63-8a82-8ccab90bfd19-1
00:52:53.709 --> 00:52:58.279
hat off his head and showing a
paper origami bird, and in the

847c7526-dec1-4a63-8a82-8ccab90bfd19-2
00:52:58.279 --> 00:53:03.069
next picture the girl a close up
of the girl's hands holding the

847c7526-dec1-4a63-8a82-8ccab90bfd19-3
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:04.469
paper origami bird.

f90db221-ea97-449d-aa5f-628d8bd6ef79-0
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:10.337
The next page has 12 small
close-up pictures. The first is

f90db221-ea97-449d-aa5f-628d8bd6ef79-1
00:53:10.337 --> 00:53:11.180
the father.

c66d4417-3997-4665-8563-785bbc2c29e5-0
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:16.189
Leaning down next to the girl
with his hand around her

c66d4417-3997-4665-8563-785bbc2c29e5-1
00:53:16.189 --> 00:53:16.800
shoulder.

c0a713b2-c8b2-4f81-bf9f-92816dd60bdb-0
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.892
Looks like he's talking to her
and she's staring down at the

c0a713b2-c8b2-4f81-bf9f-92816dd60bdb-1
00:53:20.892 --> 00:53:22.620
paper origami bird in her hands.

f6c42138-054a-4e03-9118-5ffc56f1b1d6-0
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.970
The next picture the man and the
girl are hugging.

c135861a-5101-4b38-b727-720c99b20023-0
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.167
And the next picture? The girl
is alone, looking off as if he's

c135861a-5101-4b38-b727-720c99b20023-1
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:35.610
leaving and she's holding the
paper origami bird.

e8f44e6d-5730-4254-908d-03625ab3c992-0
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:41.656
The next picture has the woman
with the kerchief and she's

e8f44e6d-5730-4254-908d-03625ab3c992-1
00:53:41.656 --> 00:53:46.605
holding a another hanky to her
eyes and her face is looking

e8f44e6d-5730-4254-908d-03625ab3c992-2
00:53:46.605 --> 00:53:51.225
like she's crying. The next
picture she and the man are

e8f44e6d-5730-4254-908d-03625ab3c992-3
00:53:51.225 --> 00:53:52.050
embracing.

7ae6f75c-75a4-4181-bd1b-9ec6853fb0b3-0
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.798
And the next picture they've
pulled apart a little and he's

7ae6f75c-75a4-4181-bd1b-9ec6853fb0b3-1
00:53:56.798 --> 00:54:00.807
perhaps whispering in her ear.
Or he's just given her a little

7ae6f75c-75a4-4181-bd1b-9ec6853fb0b3-2
00:54:00.807 --> 00:54:04.561
kiss on her cheek and one hand
is on the other side of her

7ae6f75c-75a4-4181-bd1b-9ec6853fb0b3-3
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:04.880
head.

34070861-99c0-4d99-aeaf-782cd738b3b1-0
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:11.586
The next picture we see just the
lower half of the man, his legs

34070861-99c0-4d99-aeaf-782cd738b3b1-1
00:54:11.586 --> 00:54:16.323
stepping up into the train and
his hand holding the suitcase.

34070861-99c0-4d99-aeaf-782cd738b3b1-2
00:54:16.323 --> 00:54:21.213
The next picture we see his hand
and her hand, the woman's hand

34070861-99c0-4d99-aeaf-782cd738b3b1-3
00:54:21.213 --> 00:54:25.950
and the girl's hand all holding
for a last clasp. Goodbye and

34070861-99c0-4d99-aeaf-782cd738b3b1-4
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.089
the picture that follows it.

5c78edbc-c927-4137-87ea-37ca638e5c74-0
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:32.120
Is the hands just having
released each other

6c925798-8a73-4c2a-877f-ef363fe2e9e5-0
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:37.633
The next picture is a close up
of the train moving down the

6c925798-8a73-4c2a-877f-ef363fe2e9e5-1
00:54:37.633 --> 00:54:42.312
tracks. The next picture the
train, is a little further down

6c925798-8a73-4c2a-877f-ef363fe2e9e5-2
00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:47.069
the tracks and the final picture
the train is off in the hazy

6c925798-8a73-4c2a-877f-ef363fe2e9e5-3
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.760
distance.

32a9b39c-ffd9-44d4-8cbe-8b8a68cc1f02-0
00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.270
The next page has nine square
pictures. Again we have a close

32a9b39c-ffd9-44d4-8cbe-8b8a68cc1f02-1
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.980
up of the family portrait of the
man, the woman and the girl.

f4016abe-619b-4c6d-a9e8-8ac1ccc31323-0
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.976
The next picture, the portrait
is resting on top of the

f4016abe-619b-4c6d-a9e8-8ac1ccc31323-1
00:55:02.976 --> 00:55:07.105
suitcase and we see a pair of
hands holding a bowl and a

f4016abe-619b-4c6d-a9e8-8ac1ccc31323-2
00:55:07.105 --> 00:55:07.540
spoon.

50bbf3e6-129f-4d93-8c20-31332ab81505-0
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.013
Next picture is a little further
back and we see it's the man

50bbf3e6-129f-4d93-8c20-31332ab81505-1
00:55:12.013 --> 00:55:14.650
sitting there holding the bowl
and the spoon.

00d5b605-f1e3-42ce-827b-bbb591e31741-0
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:20.383
And the next picture, it's
almost like we're looking

00d5b605-f1e3-42ce-827b-bbb591e31741-1
00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:23.602
through a portal hole. It's a
circle, and we see the man

00d5b605-f1e3-42ce-827b-bbb591e31741-2
00:55:23.602 --> 00:55:26.878
looking out the portal hole
while he's sitting there with

00d5b605-f1e3-42ce-827b-bbb591e31741-3
00:55:26.878 --> 00:55:27.330
the bowl

0bad39b6-a56b-42e7-9e15-a770c2988bd0-0
00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:32.156
With the suitcase and the framed
picture, the next picture we're

0bad39b6-a56b-42e7-9e15-a770c2988bd0-1
00:55:32.156 --> 00:55:36.204
further away and we get more of
the side of what may be a ship

0bad39b6-a56b-42e7-9e15-a770c2988bd0-2
00:55:36.204 --> 00:55:40.188
with the portal hole and the
picture of the man. And then the

0bad39b6-a56b-42e7-9e15-a770c2988bd0-3
00:55:40.188 --> 00:55:44.172
next picture we're further away
and we see three portal holes

0bad39b6-a56b-42e7-9e15-a770c2988bd0-4
00:55:44.172 --> 00:55:48.348
and can barely make the outlines
of the man in the middle portal

0bad39b6-a56b-42e7-9e15-a770c2988bd0-5
00:55:48.348 --> 00:55:48.670
hole.

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-0
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:54.704
The next picture
we're further away and there are

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-1
00:55:54.704 --> 00:55:59.562
two 4 6 8 a dozen little portal
holes. And now the next picture

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-2
00:55:59.562 --> 00:56:04.345
we're further away and we begin
to see a full section of a big

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-3
00:56:04.345 --> 00:56:08.824
steamship with many portal
holes. And then the top of this

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-4
00:56:08.824 --> 00:56:13.454
ship with the smokestacks and
the final picture on the stage

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-5
00:56:13.454 --> 00:56:18.313
On the page is a distant picture
with the full ship and sailing

3abb9f16-3116-4719-9866-d8edfecf1377-6
00:56:18.313 --> 00:56:19.300
on the water. #END_arrival_1

OK. OK.

So moving on to the next item.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.827
Again, for this complex scene,
please take between three and

9b79d750-daba-4494-a2d1-f9ed92dfba60-1
00:56:40.827 --> 00:56:41.710
five minutes.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.900
Describe what you see and what
is happening.

#START_wild_west OK, we have
another where is Waldo Two page

4117fd43-44f7-4168-bae2-1055cf25efb2-1
00:56:52.864 --> 00:56:57.798
spread. {It's the wild Wild West
and Walden says Yeehaw, Waldo

4117fd43-44f7-4168-bae2-1055cf25efb2-2
00:56:57.798 --> 00:57:02.653
watchers, have you ever seen
such a wild, wild Western? Here

4117fd43-44f7-4168-bae2-1055cf25efb2-3
00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:07.587
comes the wagon train steaming
into town. The gold rush is on

4117fd43-44f7-4168-bae2-1055cf25efb2-4
00:57:07.587 --> 00:57:12.362
and a cowboy is riding off into
the sunset. There's so much

4117fd43-44f7-4168-bae2-1055cf25efb2-5
00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:16.739
action, so much excitement. I
wonder if the real wild.

Us was as bright and colorful as
this.}

31ae6cbe-465a-49fb-a683-cf9be5fdeb8e-0
00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:28.570
And in this page, it is crowded,
full of pictures of lots of

31ae6cbe-465a-49fb-a683-cf9be5fdeb8e-1
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:34.479
people and Wild West buildings.
There's a hotel, there's a

31ae6cbe-465a-49fb-a683-cf9be5fdeb8e-2
00:57:34.479 --> 00:57:40.590
saloon, there's a general store,
there's the pioneer saloon.

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:48.306
We have the livery unstable, the
livery livery stable and the

00:57:48.306 --> 00:57:53.643
livery unstable. We have the
Wild West saloon, lots of

78347afc-d568-4354-9032-1e984168c31d-2
00:57:53.643 --> 00:57:54.420
saloons.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.290
One more saloon, a bank.

b324f868-6487-4824-b048-1c29fc3bd3cc-0
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:04.401
And in all of these places and
the colors are green and orange

b324f868-6487-4824-b048-1c29fc3bd3cc-1
00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:06.300
and red and blue and pink.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:14.886
We have some people streaming
into a gold mine and gold tours.

e1576cab-f239-4339-b8d0-430fd306a2d4-1
00:58:14.886 --> 00:58:20.816
We have people in the hotel. I
don't even know what they're

e1576cab-f239-4339-b8d0-430fd306a2d4-2
00:58:20.816 --> 00:58:21.410
doing.

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.560
It's just so busy with tables
falling over.

26d82b4b-5c1e-48a1-b1f9-bc28041217a7-0
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.400
There's some smoke. Maybe
somebody fired a gun. People are

26d82b4b-5c1e-48a1-b1f9-bc28041217a7-1
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.500
lying down, people are jumping
out.

f7427e78-cd2f-4609-891a-21fd630a956c-0
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:42.081
People are rushing down the
stairs. There's a strange person

f7427e78-cd2f-4609-891a-21fd630a956c-1
00:58:42.081 --> 00:58:47.066
coming, emerging out of a
chimney. Oh, there's a jail and

f7427e78-cd2f-4609-891a-21fd630a956c-2
00:58:47.066 --> 00:58:52.136
the sheriff and lots of people
in blue jeans and 10 gallon

f7427e78-cd2f-4609-891a-21fd630a956c-3
00:58:52.136 --> 00:58:57.120
hats. And there is a horse
sitting down drawing a picture

f7427e78-cd2f-4609-891a-21fd630a956c-4
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.550
of a.

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:04.663
Prairie wagons? Well, that's
pretty funny. And then we've got

f8f361ac-245e-4ff7-85f7-242f36c03154-1
00:59:04.663 --> 00:59:10.536
multiple pictures of stamps,
postage stamps with a Buffalo on

00:59:10.536 --> 00:59:13.000
them with horns. 29 cents.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:20.140
We have people looks like
crowding around in a saloon.

4ff4babc-f7bf-4d04-a224-c03fe5399b48-0
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:26.729
Another one with people on the
porch at the saloon on top of

4ff4babc-f7bf-4d04-a224-c03fe5399b48-1
00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:27.530
the saloon.

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:32.638
There's a little roof and
windows and two people upstairs

0642afe6-f59a-4447-ace1-2ec023d519c6-1
00:59:32.638 --> 00:59:37.525
on the roof outside the windows.
Oh, we've got some more like a

0642afe6-f59a-4447-ace1-2ec023d519c6-2
00:59:37.525 --> 00:59:42.030
whole wagon train and lots of
patches on the wagon covers.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:48.892
Outside another saloon. Oh,
there's a man running off the

4191f57c-ca9d-4835-933c-41a431205dc1-1
00:59:48.892 --> 00:59:54.220
roof holding a bag with a dollar
sign on it, so clearly a robbery

4191f57c-ca9d-4835-933c-41a431205dc1-2
00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:59.226
is in process. Outside another
saloon, we have a piano player

4191f57c-ca9d-4835-933c-41a431205dc1-3
00:59:59.226 --> 01:00:02.940
and fiddlers and music and a
crowd of people.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:04.720
Um.

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:11.567
Ohh, outside the livery stable
with the blacksmith there's a

ee0e1553-7140-4d42-9177-75243789641a-1

care of, maybe having some
horseshoes made. There's one

ee0e1553-7140-4d42-9177-75243789641a-3
01:00:19.155 --> 01:00:20.610
that's getting brushed.

5409c67a-fdf5-420f-9ce0-0f4aea3c9fc0-0
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:22.340
Um.

94a82494-b24a-43b3-9a9f-7640c58a5812-0
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:30.584
There's a person climbing up a
ladder to the roof. There's

94a82494-b24a-43b3-9a9f-7640c58a5812-1
01:00:30.584 --> 01:00:35.473
another picture, so in the
background we have desert. But

94a82494-b24a-43b3-9a9f-7640c58a5812-2
01:00:35.473 --> 01:00:40.869
there's a big mural standing up
with a glorified picture of the

94a82494-b24a-43b3-9a9f-7640c58a5812-3
01:00:40.869 --> 01:00:46.096
West, with the sun setting and
huge pink and yellow sunbeams,

94a82494-b24a-43b3-9a9f-7640c58a5812-4
01:00:46.096 --> 01:00:50.480
and a person on a horse riding
through the picture.

e186b7f5-4c2e-4382-bc1d-b4eb50be79e1-0
01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.806
And there are other people in
the foreground waving goodbye to

e186b7f5-4c2e-4382-bc1d-b4eb50be79e1-1
01:00:55.806 --> 01:00:59.090
the person on the White Horse
and the white 10 gallon hat.

413e84d7-f82e-428d-9ec5-7f4eeb924aad-0
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:04.568
Let's see. We also have a group
of people in white coats,

413e84d7-f82e-428d-9ec5-7f4eeb924aad-1
01:01:04.568 --> 01:01:09.160
perhaps with stethoscopes and
bags that they're walking by.

a221d84c-07bf-4841-8ee7-666e7205384c-0
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.798
Another place on the bank is
getting a fresh coat of red

a221d84c-07bf-4841-8ee7-666e7205384c-1
01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:20.462
paint in a very haphazard way,
with lots of different people

a221d84c-07bf-4841-8ee7-666e7205384c-2
01:01:20.462 --> 01:01:24.820
painting different sections
erratically. I do see in the

a221d84c-07bf-4841-8ee7-666e7205384c-3
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.407
lower right corner a little
steam engine, a red engine with

a221d84c-07bf-4841-8ee7-666e7205384c-4
01:01:29.407 --> 01:01:33.842
the number 2 and smoke coming
out of its stack. There's a

a221d84c-07bf-4841-8ee7-666e7205384c-5
01:01:33.842 --> 01:01:34.760
train track.

b0a13897-6b92-465e-b7be-f46d69fd8d02-0
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:41.009
There's a coach,
not steam powered, that's stuck

b0a13897-6b92-465e-b7be-f46d69fd8d02-1
01:01:41.009 --> 01:01:45.396
crossing the train track and a
bunch of people oop. I think

b0a13897-6b92-465e-b7be-f46d69fd8d02-2
01:01:45.396 --> 01:01:50.002
it's a holdup because there are
people with bandanas tied over

b0a13897-6b92-465e-b7be-f46d69fd8d02-3
01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:50.880
their faces. #END_wild_west 

ae5c7036-146b-4cd3-98ad-8849c8d0fcc8-0
01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.130
OK.

7bc366c7-04f8-411d-978b-d6b82fdc78d9-0
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.410
Next page. All right. OK. So we
can move on to the next one.

8f48bf30-de56-444b-bb14-469b967e6e64-0
01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:18.850
Um ah, continuing story in the
animated book.

71ff37f3-d657-47a0-ba21-1ea119e7560c-0
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:25.605
#START_arrival_2 We have one
page with twelve small close up

71ff37f3-d657-47a0-ba21-1ea119e7560c-1
01:02:25.605 --> 01:02:30.930
pictures and a grid 3 by 4. The
first picture has three people.

69bd2803-963e-47a1-8b8b-e6ef39cf3ebe-0
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.330
With.

3c6e8d2a-06da-423c-90b8-44b7d8866746-0
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.415
Kerchiefs or scarves or clothes
over their heads and they're

3c6e8d2a-06da-423c-90b8-44b7d8866746-1
01:02:38.415 --> 01:02:42.190
just sitting clumped together.
There's a suitcase.

976bceac-b67d-4507-bc0b-3b4663e777e5-0
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:49.251
Next picture has three other
people in suits and hats and

976bceac-b67d-4507-bc0b-3b4663e777e5-1
01:02:49.251 --> 01:02:55.192
more suitcases. The next picture
has a close up of two people, a

976bceac-b67d-4507-bc0b-3b4663e777e5-2
01:02:55.192 --> 01:02:59.580
man walking away and a woman in
the foreground.

d57f97f9-1b26-4a27-938c-2d94ac70b13e-0
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:05.130
there is a baby in her arms. The
next picture is a close up of a

d57f97f9-1b26-4a27-938c-2d94ac70b13e-1
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:08.990
man sitting on his suitcase with
an open book on his knees.

05ff02ad-df66-462b-bc2a-cdce27963d21-0
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:14.414
And the next picture is a close
up of that man, and he's writing

05ff02ad-df66-462b-bc2a-cdce27963d21-1
01:03:14.414 --> 01:03:18.611
in the book, and the next
picture he's tearing a page out

05ff02ad-df66-462b-bc2a-cdce27963d21-2
01:03:18.611 --> 01:03:19.480
of the book.

31dbb74f-531f-4b1c-b8b2-ec6f051f5870-0
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.470
In the next page.

7a6ed470-d1bb-40a8-81e3-e6bdd2a9e88b-0
01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:28.406
He's folding the piece of paper
that he tore out of his book and

7a6ed470-d1bb-40a8-81e3-e6bdd2a9e88b-1
01:03:28.406 --> 01:03:32.436
the next page. He's creasing it
further, clearly another

7a6ed470-d1bb-40a8-81e3-e6bdd2a9e88b-2
01:03:32.436 --> 01:03:36.537
origami, and process the next
picture show, his two hands

7a6ed470-d1bb-40a8-81e3-e6bdd2a9e88b-3
01:03:36.537 --> 01:03:39.790
holding a folded origami
creature with wings.

eba7114b-55a0-4797-b9b4-5cb6f77b17fd-0
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:46.256
This next picture we have a view
of the man from the waist up,

eba7114b-55a0-4797-b9b4-5cb6f77b17fd-1
01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:51.309
his arm is bent, his hand is
holding the completed origami

eba7114b-55a0-4797-b9b4-5cb6f77b17fd-2
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:56.877
creature. The next picture he's
not holding the origami and he's

eba7114b-55a0-4797-b9b4-5cb6f77b17fd-3
01:03:56.877 --> 01:04:02.188
looking over his shoulder. And
the next picture he's stood up

eba7114b-55a0-4797-b9b4-5cb6f77b17fd-4
01:04:02.188 --> 01:04:03.730
from his suitcase.

4146fc79-7d4d-4005-abb6-12ac277b4f81-0
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:09.723
And the next page has three
small pictures at the top and

4146fc79-7d4d-4005-abb6-12ac277b4f81-1
01:04:09.723 --> 01:04:14.014
then a larger picture beneath
us. The pictures are a close up

4146fc79-7d4d-4005-abb6-12ac277b4f81-2
01:04:14.014 --> 01:04:18.304
of the man. He's looking over
his shoulder and he's wearing a

4146fc79-7d4d-4005-abb6-12ac277b4f81-3
01:04:18.304 --> 01:04:20.449
hat. And then the next picture.

921c918f-b2bd-4771-9f8c-9206730145d9-0
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:26.343
His face has come around and
he's looking off to the left

921c918f-b2bd-4771-9f8c-9206730145d9-1
01:04:26.343 --> 01:04:32.050
side, and the next picture, his
face. We've got more of a full

921c918f-b2bd-4771-9f8c-9206730145d9-2
01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:37.666
on, but his face is tilted up
toward the sky and he's holding

921c918f-b2bd-4771-9f8c-9206730145d9-3
01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:42.739
his hand up to shade his eyes.
And then the big picture

921c918f-b2bd-4771-9f8c-9206730145d9-4
01:04:42.739 --> 01:04:47.811
underneath we see a whole flock
of strange white flying

921c918f-b2bd-4771-9f8c-9206730145d9-5
01:04:47.811 --> 01:04:50.620
creatures, small, kind of like.

ce07a170-e430-4556-8907-e17e48bc6102-0
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.870
Mayflies.

a49162e7-7882-45e9-8f70-b5fe539d1159-0
01:04:54.230 --> 01:05:00.450
And beneath them we have lots of
people on the deck of the ship.

0ca9ac55-7d4e-4607-8e89-72517d4e2227-0
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:04.420
And there's water around.

fd452e3a-ae10-44fe-bf11-045f0b0ca401-0
01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:11.690
Next page, next page is a two
page spread.

ced02276-3e8d-45f4-8320-744ba8a59ac1-0
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:16.915
With lots of people crowded onto
the deck of the ship, looking

ced02276-3e8d-45f4-8320-744ba8a59ac1-1
01:05:16.915 --> 01:05:20.919
across the water and in the
water are a great number of

ced02276-3e8d-45f4-8320-744ba8a59ac1-2
01:05:20.919 --> 01:05:24.781
ships, some bigger, some
smaller. There's a Steamboat

ced02276-3e8d-45f4-8320-744ba8a59ac1-3
01:05:24.781 --> 01:05:28.500
there looks like a sailboat,
some other boats with.

f9e17e8e-d61c-49b2-b70a-86758401d28e-0
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:31.540
Chimneys.

bd7c2829-841f-490d-ab57-d4e113126d4e-0
01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.840
Um and city in the smoggy
distance.

46e3e820-c25a-4577-b8d9-c2ee8ef6242e-0
01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:44.065
And then across the water is a
huge sculpture of two people

46e3e820-c25a-4577-b8d9-c2ee8ef6242e-1
01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:50.098
leaning in toward each other
shaking hands. They have long

46e3e820-c25a-4577-b8d9-c2ee8ef6242e-2
01:05:50.098 --> 01:05:56.233
coats and one has a pointed hat
and one has a a squared off

46e3e820-c25a-4577-b8d9-c2ee8ef6242e-3
01:05:56.233 --> 01:06:01.960
cylindrical hat. One has a
creature with big ears and a

46e3e820-c25a-4577-b8d9-c2ee8ef6242e-4
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:08.299
long tail that's curling up on
the arm, and the other person.

122b5d22-8e6a-406e-a7f7-2010f49e388f-0
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:14.493
has a bird like creature sitting
on its shoulder and I'm not sure

122b5d22-8e6a-406e-a7f7-2010f49e388f-1
01:06:14.493 --> 01:06:20.246
if there's statues or if they're
oversized people standing in

122b5d22-8e6a-406e-a7f7-2010f49e388f-2
01:06:20.246 --> 01:06:25.349
boats because there are boats
beneath them, one with a

122b5d22-8e6a-406e-a7f7-2010f49e388f-3
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:31.380
suitcase and a coffee cup and a
bowl and a another container and

122b5d22-8e6a-406e-a7f7-2010f49e388f-4
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.575
another one was a a conical
thing, another teapot and a

122b5d22-8e6a-406e-a7f7-2010f49e388f-5
01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:38.710
large vessel container.

6e476110-df65-4e59-81ba-d6d0b40411b1-0
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:48.939
The next page has one full big
picture head on. Picture from

6e476110-df65-4e59-81ba-d6d0b40411b1-1
01:06:48.939 --> 01:06:55.608
the water level of the incoming
steam ship. Big, big front of it

6e476110-df65-4e59-81ba-d6d0b40411b1-2
01:06:55.608 --> 01:07:01.559
is dark and almost menacing
coming through the channel in

6e476110-df65-4e59-81ba-d6d0b40411b1-3
01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:07.613
the water there's steam and
cloud in the skies, little bit

6e476110-df65-4e59-81ba-d6d0b40411b1-4
01:07:07.613 --> 01:07:09.050
of brightness.

1bd3a2f8-192f-4fd4-94be-371c844df7ab-0
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:15.603
More of the white flying
creatures. The next page has six

1bd3a2f8-192f-4fd4-94be-371c844df7ab-1
01:07:15.603 --> 01:07:17.860
small close-up pictures.

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-0
01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:24.664
There's a close up of a cluster
of people, some men with hats, a

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-1
01:07:24.664 --> 01:07:29.035
woman with a scarf over her
head, a younger person with no

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-2
01:07:29.035 --> 01:07:33.627
head covering. The next picture
has one person who looks like

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-3
01:07:33.627 --> 01:07:37.998
they're in charge, perhaps a
conductor with a conical flat

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-4
01:07:37.998 --> 01:07:42.591
topped hat and a big megaphone
that he's holding to his mouth

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-5
01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:47.257
and pointing with one finger,
one hand. The next picture has a

067e5849-37c1-473f-a4a2-1f52adeb9b37-6

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.792
Unlocking and opening perhaps
the gates from the ship, the

ccacd4f9-8f84-4518-8503-f1015833e6b1-1
01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:59.789
next picture has a close up of
an arm and a hand holding the

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.947
 the next picture is a cluster
of people standing together

43f46427-b816-482c-b129-29b85c4c4d38-1
01:08:06.947 --> 01:08:09.360
holding their bags and packages.

5ed20f39-bdfc-4285-8d7a-dc4419bff961-0
01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.642
The next picture
is the cluster of people and

5ed20f39-bdfc-4285-8d7a-dc4419bff961-1
01:08:15.642 --> 01:08:20.543
they are now moving down a plank
or a walkway and then at the

01:08:20.543 --> 01:08:25.523
bottom of the page is 1 larger

01:08:25.523 --> 01:08:30.504
They appear to have disembarked
the ship. The prow of the ship

5ed20f39-bdfc-4285-8d7a-dc4419bff961-4
01:08:30.504 --> 01:08:35.484
is in the background. They are
in the foreground on some dingy

5ed20f39-bdfc-4285-8d7a-dc4419bff961-5

piece of land or pavement. #END_arrival_2

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:40.120
OK.

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.600
Hang on.

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:51.576
#START_being_a_pirate OK, we
have another where's Waldo? Two

980c1d0e-1214-4109-8efa-07a9753f99c1-1
01:08:51.576 --> 01:08:56.177
page spread and a little opened
book in the upper left corner

980c1d0e-1214-4109-8efa-07a9753f99c1-2
01:08:56.177 --> 01:09:00.778
saying 250 years ago being a
pirate shiver me Timbers. It was

980c1d0e-1214-4109-8efa-07a9753f99c1-3
01:09:00.778 --> 01:09:05.156
really a lot of fun being a
pirate, especially if you were

980c1d0e-1214-4109-8efa-07a9753f99c1-4
01:09:05.156 --> 01:09:09.757
very hairy and didn't have much
in the way of braids. It also

980c1d0e-1214-4109-8efa-07a9753f99c1-5
01:09:09.757 --> 01:09:13.689
helped if you had a peg leg and
eye patch a bandana.

cdaab2c6-57d4-475e-a022-f20de2b030e0-0
01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:20.073
Pirates sent with your name tag
sewn inside a treasure map and a

cdaab2c6-57d4-475e-a022-f20de2b030e0-1
01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:25.950
rusty cutlass. Once there were
lots of pirates, but they died.

864ba8b3-9022-409f-9edf-a622cce82596-0
01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:33.986
Um, something they died out in
the end because too many of

864ba8b3-9022-409f-9edf-a622cce82596-1
01:09:33.986 --> 01:09:34.490
them.

c9d0a9bd-282e-47fa-a071-34c5be9ee614-0
01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.810
Men, which is not a good idea,
hmm.

ed9fe5ff-4e47-413a-9e51-424a8e3e3f64-0
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:43.980
OK, so in this two page spread
we have.

82b10efd-3293-4407-95db-b8668c5ce4a3-0
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.167
A seascape. We're in a harbor.
There's a large pirate ship in

82b10efd-3293-4407-95db-b8668c5ce4a3-1
01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:55.570
the foreground with lots of
little dingy boats.

58929ae8-755f-4c81-91b3-554e22a637e6-0
01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:02.187
Approaching and departing from
the pirate ship to the left is

58929ae8-755f-4c81-91b3-554e22a637e6-1
01:10:02.187 --> 01:10:05.840
apparently another pirate ship.
You can see a.

04503cb3-69da-4348-a5b8-5ac5c6f05b8d-0
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:09.850
Flag with the skull and
crossbones.

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-0
01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:16.561
And off to the right in the
distance is another ship with

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-1
01:10:16.561 --> 01:10:21.706
more skull and crossbone flags.
And up there's some smoke. Looks

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-2
01:10:21.706 --> 01:10:26.455
like they're firing cannons over
there. Oh yes, I see a big

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-3
01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:30.809
plopping splash in the water. I
see the arc of another

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-4
01:10:30.809 --> 01:10:35.558
cannonball going over a small
boat in the water. One of the

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-5
01:10:35.558 --> 01:10:40.545
boats. So this far off boat on
the right, a pirate is making a

a4a11996-9774-4f2b-bf2d-36265cafda07-6
01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:41.100
person.

31acce93-53d4-4049-a98d-76d0d2504341-0
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:46.430
Walk the plank, and underneath
the plank is a circle of hungry

31acce93-53d4-4049-a98d-76d0d2504341-1
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:51.195
sharks with chefs, hats and
napkins tied around their necks,

31acce93-53d4-4049-a98d-76d0d2504341-2
01:10:51.195 --> 01:10:51.820
waiting.

dd115a27-25a3-42a1-9ef6-e9d97de75ca4-0
01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:53.260
Um.

64e1bb52-cceb-424f-902f-1a3088fddfac-0
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:58.927
There are people climbing up in
the crows nest and on the masts

64e1bb52-cceb-424f-902f-1a3088fddfac-1
01:10:58.927 --> 01:11:00.880
and up there rigging and.

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-0
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:06.886
Climbing down the anchor chain,
it's just all kinds of busyness

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-1
01:11:06.886 --> 01:11:11.106
and craziness and all of the
little boats. There are many,

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-2
01:11:11.106 --> 01:11:15.325
probably a dozen or more of
these little dinghy boats. You

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-3
01:11:15.325 --> 01:11:19.330
know, they look like wooden
crafts that are filled with

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-4
01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:23.263
pirates. Every single one of
them. Oh, there's a a sea

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-5
01:11:23.263 --> 01:11:27.411
monster, an octopus type
creature that's got three people

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-6
01:11:27.411 --> 01:11:31.844
and three of its tentacles and
another one that's fallen into

0bd442cc-e827-4812-8fbb-51dbd19b0ce3-7
01:11:31.844 --> 01:11:32.559
the water.

609dbdcd-a494-4cb5-a4a6-841ee6519dd6-0
01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.100
Umm.

d30e9600-183e-4b94-9a5e-b4ed7550758f-0
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:39.829
What else do we see around
another couple of dingy boats?

d30e9600-183e-4b94-9a5e-b4ed7550758f-1
01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:44.142
We see people also in the water.
I don't know if they're in

d30e9600-183e-4b94-9a5e-b4ed7550758f-2
01:11:44.142 --> 01:11:48.024
shallow enough water that
they're just swimming in or

d30e9600-183e-4b94-9a5e-b4ed7550758f-3
01:11:48.024 --> 01:11:52.625
walking in. And there are some
people that are walking onto the

d30e9600-183e-4b94-9a5e-b4ed7550758f-4
01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:57.298
shore. There's a shore. It looks
kind of scruffy with a few palm

d30e9600-183e-4b94-9a5e-b4ed7550758f-5
01:11:57.298 --> 01:11:57.729
trees.

47513aa4-f14b-404f-942a-feb4cf860ed5-0
01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:03.568
 Somebody's digging and there is
a treasure chest, but it looks

47513aa4-f14b-404f-942a-feb4cf860ed5-1
01:12:03.568 --> 01:12:03.980
empty.

4feb5b7f-bf0d-47aa-a8da-1f48e7696a97-0
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.884
Ohh and a cannonball it looks
like has gone awry and has hit a

4feb5b7f-bf0d-47aa-a8da-1f48e7696a97-1
01:12:10.884 --> 01:12:15.028
palm tree and it's breaking and
a person is falling out of the

4feb5b7f-bf0d-47aa-a8da-1f48e7696a97-2
01:12:15.028 --> 01:12:16.410
top of the palm tree.

83036f73-1a81-462b-affd-425eb4447671-0
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:22.594
Let's see what's going on. Some
of the other dingy boats. On one

83036f73-1a81-462b-affd-425eb4447671-1
01:12:22.594 --> 01:12:27.046
of the dingy boats, most of the
people are jumping overboard

83036f73-1a81-462b-affd-425eb4447671-2
01:12:27.046 --> 01:12:31.498
into the water. Another dingy
boat, the crew are pulling the

83036f73-1a81-462b-affd-425eb4447671-3
01:12:31.498 --> 01:12:35.878
oars. Another dingy boat has
broken in two and sinking, and

83036f73-1a81-462b-affd-425eb4447671-4
01:12:35.878 --> 01:12:36.900
all hands are.

0ce0a0b6-1c60-4738-b19d-258f6f66651e-0
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:43.700
Floundering in the water, trying
to save themselves.

3c282817-3c78-47f2-8815-568c53589b56-0
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.630
More dingy boats.

221ea4bf-6dcb-4cac-be05-ba919702e207-0
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:56.371
In the big center boat, there's
a cannonball going up into the

221ea4bf-6dcb-4cac-be05-ba919702e207-1
01:12:56.371 --> 01:13:01.312
crows nest and dispersing the
pirates who are up there. There

221ea4bf-6dcb-4cac-be05-ba919702e207-2
01:13:01.312 --> 01:13:06.174
are three masts on this boat,
and there are pirates all over

221ea4bf-6dcb-4cac-be05-ba919702e207-3
01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:09.920
each of the masts and the crows
nests and the.

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:14.600
beams for the sails going
across.

1d480583-a037-45fa-88fd-94053ec135ed-0
01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:22.191
Yeah, funny
thing. This one big central ship

1d480583-a037-45fa-88fd-94053ec135ed-1
01:13:22.191 --> 01:13:26.640
does not have a skull and
crossbones. It has Pennant flags

1d480583-a037-45fa-88fd-94053ec135ed-2
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.240
with blue and white panels on
it. So perhaps the pirates are

1d480583-a037-45fa-88fd-94053ec135ed-3
01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.880
all attacking this one major
ship. #END_being_a_pirate

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.680
That's all I have to say about
that, OK.

0473d622-46aa-4471-8d5a-391ab8875981-0
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.160
Hang on to the next one.

over, Waldo fans, but what a

3f954948-8d42-45b3-a9c4-e00572035ad5-2
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:58.361
fitting finale. A fantastic
exhibition in a proper art

3f954948-8d42-45b3-a9c4-e00572035ad5-3
01:13:58.361 --> 01:14:03.052

more welcoming than odd laws.

3f954948-8d42-45b3-a9c4-e00572035ad5-4
01:14:03.052 --> 01:14:07.664
Odd ensemble from the first
scene. I'm also really pleased

3f954948-8d42-45b3-a9c4-e00572035ad5-5
01:14:07.664 --> 01:14:12.511
that all 30 of the characters
we've been searching for in the

earlier scenes appear.

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:18.825
Again here among the gallery
gazers, see if you can spot them

1022d07e-b690-46b8-9b3e-6aba7e5b589a-1
01:14:18.825 --> 01:14:23.261
as they try to blend into the
crowd and enjoy the show. I hope

1022d07e-b690-46b8-9b3e-6aba7e5b589a-2
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:27.767
you found them in the previous
pages too. If not, there's still

1022d07e-b690-46b8-9b3e-6aba7e5b589a-3
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:31.570
plenty of time to do so the
exhibition never closes.}

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:39.019
So we have a

01:14:39.019 --> 01:14:43.886
people. There's a floor level in
this exhibition, there's a

c2932243-3470-476d-9a3c-bcb428bc72b3-2
01:14:43.886 --> 01:14:48.185
stairway that goes up to a
mezzanine level, which is

c2932243-3470-476d-9a3c-bcb428bc72b3-3
01:14:48.185 --> 01:14:52.808
crowded like people just
squeezed in next to each other.

c2932243-3470-476d-9a3c-bcb428bc72b3-4
01:14:52.808 --> 01:14:57.350
And then there's another
stairway up to the next level,

c2932243-3470-476d-9a3c-bcb428bc72b3-5
01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:02.378
again full of people. And on the
red walls are all manner and

c2932243-3470-476d-9a3c-bcb428bc72b3-6
01:15:02.378 --> 01:15:03.920
shade of portraits.

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:07.789
They are Oval shaped, some are
square, some are rectangular.

c932731d-c1da-455d-8a67-dc5c40a69b88-1
01:15:07.789 --> 01:15:11.090
Most of them are people, but
there's one of a shark.

a704aabb-c7b5-4237-9bd7-b116d48d674e-0
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.690
Let's see.

b1237566-1133-453b-862b-4f0d66f0dbb2-0
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:20.824
There's a picture of a person
behind bars. There's a picture

b1237566-1133-453b-862b-4f0d66f0dbb2-1
01:15:20.824 --> 01:15:24.655
of a person with looks like a
soccer ball for a head. There

b1237566-1133-453b-862b-4f0d66f0dbb2-2
01:15:24.655 --> 01:15:26.060
are two pictures that.

90326b58-a046-4b54-9308-a65e77a4f5ae-0
01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:31.834
Are actually made-up of two
panels each. The head is 1 panel

90326b58-a046-4b54-9308-a65e77a4f5ae-1
01:15:31.834 --> 01:15:35.743
and then the body is the 2nd
panel underneath and there are

90326b58-a046-4b54-9308-a65e77a4f5ae-2
01:15:35.743 --> 01:15:36.590
two of those.

01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:40.620
People are carrying a big
portrait of.

01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:45.220
Someone in armor and a sword.

63337964-559d-4579-9e54-e0297c5c033b-0
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:53.004
Let's see. There's a ladder
hanging all around the big sign

63337964-559d-4579-9e54-e0297c5c033b-1
01:15:53.004 --> 01:15:57.362
with Waldo's message, and the
sign is boarded with red

63337964-559d-4579-9e54-e0297c5c033b-2
01:15:57.362 --> 01:16:02.274
question marks. And there are
ladders on both sides of people

63337964-559d-4579-9e54-e0297c5c033b-3
01:16:02.274 --> 01:16:06.870
going up and down and leaning
all over it. There are more

63337964-559d-4579-9e54-e0297c5c033b-4
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:10.990
people hanging from
Scaffoldings, which are lowered

63337964-559d-4579-9e54-e0297c5c033b-5
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:12.100
down by ropes.

34fb17b7-3413-4d06-856f-17e4a4254e05-0
01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.211
Going back down to the ground
floor, what kinds of strange and

34fb17b7-3413-4d06-856f-17e4a4254e05-1
01:16:18.211 --> 01:16:20.170
curious people can we find?

4fab397a-8726-48a0-a55e-2c28f45e901b-0
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:25.590
There is a person mounting some
pictures on the wall like

4fab397a-8726-48a0-a55e-2c28f45e901b-1
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:30.006
wallpaper, the papers almost all
attached and there's a big brush

4fab397a-8726-48a0-a55e-2c28f45e901b-2
01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:34.288
for pushing it and smoothing out
the adhesive on the backside I

4fab397a-8726-48a0-a55e-2c28f45e901b-3
01:16:34.288 --> 01:16:37.500
imagine and the person is
standing on a ladder.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:44.932
There are pictures of men and
women. There are antiquated

6aae93e5-113d-493f-9571-679edca5285b-1
01:16:44.932 --> 01:16:49.999
pictures. The picture of a dog,
a picture of people together. A

6aae93e5-113d-493f-9571-679edca5285b-2
01:16:49.999 --> 01:16:52.850
picture of a person smoking a
pipe.

57e010b9-f133-48c2-a49d-f9a97a6e0b8a-0
01:16:55.310 --> 01:17:00.342
Down in the center, emerging
from one section of the ground

57e010b9-f133-48c2-a49d-f9a97a6e0b8a-1
01:17:00.342 --> 01:17:05.207
floor level, is a huge cluster
of cops with arms and legs

57e010b9-f133-48c2-a49d-f9a97a6e0b8a-2
01:17:05.207 --> 01:17:09.737
reaching in every which
direction. Perhaps someone is

57e010b9-f133-48c2-a49d-f9a97a6e0b8a-3
01:17:09.737 --> 01:17:13.680
stealing a picture of a king
being walked off.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.730
 there's a picture of a clown.

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:20.720
There's an
upside down picture. #END_exhibit_12

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:33.300
I'm on sensory overload.

b53823af-6186-49ad-b697-28c746b5b91d-0
01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.600
Yeah, that's all I have to say
about this, OK.

35b5bb64-d802-44bb-be75-a2055fc0bcf7-0
01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.230
OK, so I'm moving on.

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:44.920
Ohh.

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-0

#START_unfriendly_giants Another where's Waldo. The
unfriendly giants. This is

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-1
01:17:49.763 --> 01:17:54.543
written on a scroll at the upper
left side. {Then Waldo and Wizard

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-2
01:17:54.543 --> 01:17:58.961
White Beard came to the land of
the unfriendly giants, where

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-3
01:17:58.961 --> 01:18:03.597
many waldos had been before. And
Waldo saw that the Giants were

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-4
01:18:03.597 --> 01:18:07.942
horridly harassing the little
people. And when he found the

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-5
01:18:07.942 --> 01:18:12.288
10th scroll, it was time to
continue with his journey.} And

afb74f45-923f-44cd-9ea5-31cdc0c7f722-6
01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:15.910
there's like a wax seal.

87dddf8d-412e-4fbf-a339-8a7df64b105c-0
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:21.543
Embossed with Waldo's face and a
blue and a red ribbon sticking

87dddf8d-412e-4fbf-a339-8a7df64b105c-1
01:18:21.543 --> 01:18:26.262
out of it to authenticate the
scroll, and then the two page

87dddf8d-412e-4fbf-a339-8a7df64b105c-2
01:18:26.262 --> 01:18:27.600

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.170
With Giants dispersed at a
distance.

cc140667-93cf-4a61-bdcf-9ce176870f60-0
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:39.237
Some are among the trees
standing taller than the trees.

cc140667-93cf-4a61-bdcf-9ce176870f60-1
01:18:39.237 --> 01:18:44.027
Some are standing outside a
castle taller than the castle.

cc140667-93cf-4a61-bdcf-9ce176870f60-2
01:18:44.027 --> 01:18:48.411
There are some standing by a
windmill taller than the

cc140667-93cf-4a61-bdcf-9ce176870f60-3
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:53.444
windmill. Looks like one is out
in the field, perhaps turning

cc140667-93cf-4a61-bdcf-9ce176870f60-4
01:18:53.444 --> 01:18:54.500
over a a hay.

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:56.730
Um.

b0277654-3100-49a4-8d64-eb594d95b5fa-0
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:06.116
Container that's gathered up the
hay up. There's a a pretty

b0277654-3100-49a4-8d64-eb594d95b5fa-1
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:12.090
female giant and another male
giant standing together.

6b5df67b-f016-421d-bd27-17256c9c20a6-0
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:17.448
Um, ohh. There's a giant that
has uprooted a tree, and he's

6b5df67b-f016-421d-bd27-17256c9c20a6-1
01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:20.927
using he's turned it upside
down, and he's using the

6b5df67b-f016-421d-bd27-17256c9c20a6-2
01:19:20.927 --> 01:19:24.734
branches and the leaves to
perhaps brush away the people,

6b5df67b-f016-421d-bd27-17256c9c20a6-3
01:19:24.734 --> 01:19:27.820
the little tiny people on the
ground near him.

6a7e25e9-b360-4d9d-bf26-99cdf734939b-0
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:34.068
Oh, there is a picture of a
giant with a big belt with

6a7e25e9-b360-4d9d-bf26-99cdf734939b-1
01:19:34.068 --> 01:19:39.444
spaces to where he has stuffed
people that he has captured in

6a7e25e9-b360-4d9d-bf26-99cdf734939b-2
01:19:39.444 --> 01:19:44.040
his belt. I think they're even
people in his hoodie.

5e0a094b-1ed4-49cc-b503-f2912c43bf53-0
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:50.955
Um, ohh. There are some people
fighting back. Like four or five

5e0a094b-1ed4-49cc-b503-f2912c43bf53-1
01:19:50.955 --> 01:19:55.930
of them are holding a large long
projectile arm with a big boxing

5e0a094b-1ed4-49cc-b503-f2912c43bf53-2
01:19:55.930 --> 01:20:00.379
glove on it, and it's just
whacked a giant in the head and

5e0a094b-1ed4-49cc-b503-f2912c43bf53-3
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:02.489
he's looking a little dazed.

40992731-a17d-4b13-a793-40209d6aeca9-0
01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:09.949
You know what the pretty female
giants are just wooden cutouts.

40992731-a17d-4b13-a793-40209d6aeca9-1
01:20:09.949 --> 01:20:14.752
And there are three of them that
I can see on this page. And the

40992731-a17d-4b13-a793-40209d6aeca9-2
01:20:14.752 --> 01:20:19.260
male giants are all approaching
these cutouts, pursing their

40992731-a17d-4b13-a793-40209d6aeca9-3
01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.989
lips, waiting to kiss her with
little hearts above their heads.

40992731-a17d-4b13-a793-40209d6aeca9-4
01:20:23.989 --> 01:20:24.950
Silly giants.

257d23a4-1be6-4cdf-9a52-1ecdcc3c95d8-0
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:31.780
Let's see. Oh, here's a giant
who's.

5050d367-8ead-4bf9-8eef-d883071ed850-0
01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:37.504
Ohh my. In the center of the
page we have a little fetch

5050d367-8ead-4bf9-8eef-d883071ed850-1
01:20:37.504 --> 01:20:41.815
house with a bunch of people
standing in, circled by a big

5050d367-8ead-4bf9-8eef-d883071ed850-2
01:20:41.815 --> 01:20:46.490
noose lying on the ground, the
end of which is held by a giant.

5050d367-8ead-4bf9-8eef-d883071ed850-3
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:50.290
He's clearly trying to catch
them. The people have.

07e53ac8-7ef5-421f-8047-ec8f0fde8222-0
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:55.232
Followed his example and have
made their own noose and landed

07e53ac8-7ef5-421f-8047-ec8f0fde8222-1
01:20:55.232 --> 01:20:59.237
on the ground and there's a long
group of people holding on to

07e53ac8-7ef5-421f-8047-ec8f0fde8222-2
01:20:59.237 --> 01:21:03.116
the end of the rope and a giant
has stepped into it and they

07e53ac8-7ef5-421f-8047-ec8f0fde8222-3
01:21:03.116 --> 01:21:07.058
have tightened it around his
ankle and they're trying to pull

07e53ac8-7ef5-421f-8047-ec8f0fde8222-4
01:21:07.058 --> 01:21:11.064
him to stop and there's another
noose snare that he's about to

07e53ac8-7ef5-421f-8047-ec8f0fde8222-5
01:21:11.064 --> 01:21:11.699
step into.

0c5b7a79-8ef8-4775-99c9-493f151b17b9-0
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:17.335
Up here's a giant approaching
one of the female giant cutouts

0c5b7a79-8ef8-4775-99c9-493f151b17b9-1
01:21:17.335 --> 01:21:21.114
with the thought is a bouquet of
flowers, but it's actually

0c5b7a79-8ef8-4775-99c9-493f151b17b9-2
01:21:21.114 --> 01:21:22.500
another uprooted Bush.

da5668f3-58de-46a8-8bb7-b06dfe327850-0
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:30.290
And in the foreground we have
oh, thirsty giants who have long

da5668f3-58de-46a8-8bb7-b06dfe327850-1
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:35.450
striped straws, who have sucked

I think it's the kids who are in
costumes, because there are

There's a open book

there's a chariot race, although

And then there's another one
with horses. But the person

01:28:47.142 --> 01:28:51.639

01:28:51.639 --> 01:28:56.286
pulled out and is trying to get
back in. We have random lions

01:28:56.286 --> 01:29:01.009

for a meal, and there's a person

01:33:16.843 --> 01:33:21.238
his legs up and down, but he's
an angry expression. So I see

01:33:21.238 --> 01:33:25.778

to scold him and not to taunt.

of people are standing around,
milling around, walking around,

1f43c712-a2ea-4535-a3e7-cab222e89eca-2
01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:41.885
playing different sports with
soccer balls and volleyballs.

1f43c712-a2ea-4535-a3e7-cab222e89eca-3
01:35:41.885 --> 01:35:45.490
There's a little child with a
net and a little.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.570
You know, a little inlet of
water for the small children in

3b59d7c4-f548-4e60-aa60-77f1cc802e05-1
01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:54.430

01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:00.738
Big inflatable rubber ring that
a person is sitting and there's

4560534c-44a3-41bb-b5ee-e8097bf8f468-1
01:36:00.738 --> 01:36:05.293

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:09.923
zipping through making spray,
and I see a Penguin floating in

4560534c-44a3-41bb-b5ee-e8097bf8f468-3
01:36:09.923 --> 01:36:10.669

01:36:27.453 --> 01:36:31.370
a large house, you know, could
be the visitor center.

01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:42.421
Yeah, that's it. Ohh. We have
people water skiing. This is the

first thing that I saw.

c1e1905a-9dbe-41cb-af8d-fcbf69eab144-0
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:52.963
They are 12345 tiers, rows
standing on each other's

c1e1905a-9dbe-41cb-af8d-fcbf69eab144-1
01:36:52.963 --> 01:36:58.060

01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:06.574
They're not sailboats. They're
kind of little thing that a

91da61d1-4d76-467c-90d6-5110e4e6c6ea-1
01:37:06.574 --> 01:37:07.610
single person.

01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:13.213
Can work with
the sail but it's not a boat.

5da9a73b-4b79-488c-8517-c56d20435b16-1
01:37:13.213 --> 01:37:16.856

up paddle board, there's a float
with crowded with people and

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:23.109

#START_deep_sea_divers The deep
sea divers.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.580
{Then Waldo and Wizard White
Beard came to the watery world

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:55.250
of the deep sea divers where
many waldos had been before. And

0178cf02-3d3f-4b91-b702-5cfacd40b7bb-2
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:59.846
Waldos searched for the 8th

01:37:59.846 --> 01:38:04.215
deep, among the mermaids,
fishermen and fish. And when he

it's a cutaway.

So you can see beneath the water
and all kinds of activity with

01:38:21.294 --> 01:38:23.840

The big fish coming up up. He
looks like he has swallowed the
