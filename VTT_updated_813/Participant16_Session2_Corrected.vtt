is happening as we go through

35d4dc7f-4fa4-415e-8e3b-8021a1e2bdde-3
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.436
this story. This story in
particular is about 20 pages and

35d4dc7f-4fa4-415e-8e3b-8021a1e2bdde-4
00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:28.410

15 minutes.

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:55.960
and in the two opening pages we
see a city.

5a0aaf79-2666-45b9-a699-c701171b02ba-0
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.040
In the center of all of the
drawings of the buildings.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.514
Are in tan kind of golden tan in
different shades. The center of

ed2c9b4c-0202-4c8b-8d52-549b723b9d73-1
00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.050
the picture is.

af55cfe9-32fe-4766-879e-50652a6ceed6-0
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.350
A girl of around 10 sitting on
the front steps of the house.

10e6acf6-8a35-4df6-b2b0-a1cd568d9bff-0
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.410
With her hands folded on her
knees.

839d98ba-6c1a-44c3-909e-5cd9873baf54-0
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.341
And leaning on the sidewalk at
the bottom of the steps is a red

839d98ba-6c1a-44c3-909e-5cd9873baf54-1
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:34.170
scooter, which is the center of
the illustration.

3f63aedd-160c-460c-8544-1f61ed96af34-0
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.240
Behind the girl we can see into
the rooms of the house.

4cf63560-b67f-4b15-8d97-1a70f3387b01-0
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.774
Mom in the kitchen, stirring a
pot. Dad upstairs at his

4cf63560-b67f-4b15-8d97-1a70f3387b01-1
00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:48.260
computer, sis on the couch.

1a0dc1a1-7d55-4dc3-af9d-33054aba15f7-0
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.300
Looking on a screen.

c908fb9a-2169-458d-9b1d-d2094458302a-0
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.530
{Next photo.}

2dc1fce8-baaa-4018-97fb-34b23465aa35-0
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.573
Now we see the young girl inside
with her scooter at the counter

2dc1fce8-baaa-4018-97fb-34b23465aa35-1
00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:10.840
in the kitchen while Mom is on
the phone and stirring her pot.

2dc1fce8-baaa-4018-97fb-34b23465aa35-2
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.022
Here she is with her red kite,
leaning over the back of dad's

2dc1fce8-baaa-4018-97fb-34b23465aa35-3
00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:21.038
chair while he leans gazing into
his computer, leans on his

2dc1fce8-baaa-4018-97fb-34b23465aa35-4
00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:26.388
elbows. Next, with her red ball,
she leans over the back of the

2dc1fce8-baaa-4018-97fb-34b23465aa35-5
00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:26.890
couch.

1537f628-d4ec-4dcd-a49f-ae7c046660bd-0
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.466
While SIS reclined on the couch,
is intent on her little screen.

1537f628-d4ec-4dcd-a49f-ae7c046660bd-1
00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:37.605
In the next image, we see the
girl in her own room. The door

1537f628-d4ec-4dcd-a49f-ae7c046660bd-2
00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:43.166
is open. On the wall is a map of
the world. Outside the window we

1537f628-d4ec-4dcd-a49f-ae7c046660bd-3
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:48.473
can see other buildings. Oh, and
here's a Kitty, asleep on the

1537f628-d4ec-4dcd-a49f-ae7c046660bd-4
00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:51.170
floor of the room. {Next image.}

f423e537-09de-4403-bce2-9e9088898841-0
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.510
The cat. Now we see the same
room. The girl is leaning up.

60f3791d-eefb-45c7-83c6-c71500ba0977-0
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.252
She's looking at a red crayon
that's over on the side of the

60f3791d-eefb-45c7-83c6-c71500ba0977-1
00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:10.103
floor where the cat has been and
the cat's on the way out the

60f3791d-eefb-45c7-83c6-c71500ba0977-2
00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:15.189
door. In the next image the girl
has picked up the crayon. She's

60f3791d-eefb-45c7-83c6-c71500ba0977-3
00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.805
sitting on the floor, there's
some sheets of paper and she

60f3791d-eefb-45c7-83c6-c71500ba0977-4
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:24.577
draws first an arch onto the
wall of the room and then draws

60f3791d-eefb-45c7-83c6-c71500ba0977-5
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:28.490
a door, which she opens and
enters. {next image.}

72435316-8373-4db7-a770-45e4593da271-0
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.709
She comes out of that red door
into a forest of tall, tall

72435316-8373-4db7-a770-45e4593da271-1
00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.676
trees hung with lights and blue
lanterns, and the stream runs

72435316-8373-4db7-a770-45e4593da271-2
00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:50.520
through the grassy runs
meandering under the trees.

37b7ba23-ab9a-4a41-916d-46d23e4e73d5-0
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.820
On the grassy forest floor.
{Next image.}

d00a1078-afc0-4a05-95f9-a59e25e772fb-0
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.436
The young girl walks out onto
the end of a little pier and

d00a1078-afc0-4a05-95f9-a59e25e772fb-1
00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:03.646
looks down into the stream,
where she sees her reflection

d00a1078-afc0-4a05-95f9-a59e25e772fb-2
00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:04.920
holding the red crayon.

3fd6ebf6-b42d-4d3d-8632-73946238768d-0
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.656
Around her we see the green glow
of the trees, the lanterns, blue

3fd6ebf6-b42d-4d3d-8632-73946238768d-1
00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:18.694
lanterns hanging from high up in
the trees, streamers of yellow

3fd6ebf6-b42d-4d3d-8632-73946238768d-2
00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:24.260
lights. She leans in the next
panel down over the pier and

3fd6ebf6-b42d-4d3d-8632-73946238768d-3
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.260
draws with her red crayon into
the water a red boat.

3779ca43-a18b-478a-9953-067ae202c5cd-0
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.406
{Next image} and oh excuse me,
in that boat, she floats away.

3779ca43-a18b-478a-9953-067ae202c5cd-1
00:04:36.406 --> 00:04:42.204
The stream takes her out of the
forest to a great castled city,

3779ca43-a18b-478a-9953-067ae202c5cd-2
00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:44.650
a giant city of there's a a

b3a9ed4e-a40f-4ffe-a7b1-4f5a8cea677b-0
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.385
Drawbridge ahead and giant
Archway. I see soldiers

b3a9ed4e-a40f-4ffe-a7b1-4f5a8cea677b-1
00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:51.270
guarding.

5de3e992-648e-4529-a312-8453dc21dd82-0
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.840
The towers and the ramparts.

c39250d5-c59b-4dab-9627-1edc72f282e8-0
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.200
Beautiful rooftops, a green
stone city with many causeways.

e9547cbc-5cbc-4ba3-ae14-c4dab7142d8b-0
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.860
{And let's go to the next
image.}

e0a23da4-f928-4a70-96f0-e1fae14e5a7b-0
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.379
Young girl in a red boat moves
up a series of locks to the high

e0a23da4-f928-4a70-96f0-e1fae14e5a7b-1
00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:26.426
causeways, which run around the
tops of the walls of the city.

e0a23da4-f928-4a70-96f0-e1fae14e5a7b-2
00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:32.131
High, high up. It's an
intricate, intricate set of

e0a23da4-f928-4a70-96f0-e1fae14e5a7b-3
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:38.731
locks and rising levels and
gondoliers on small boats that

e0a23da4-f928-4a70-96f0-e1fae14e5a7b-4
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:39.850
they pull.

18b61ac6-4ca4-4685-90ec-86542ed5c0e3-0
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.046
Along the canals, our passenger
in the red boat is greeted by

18b61ac6-4ca4-4685-90ec-86542ed5c0e3-1
00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:50.310
soldiers who salute and wave.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.109
Ah, the little boat comes to the
edge of the Causeway and goes

8df08cc4-3364-4d89-92ef-c33340c32950-1
00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:02.280
over over a waterfall, but as.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:14.378
Our young lady is falling with
her red crayon. She draws a half

63e02756-344f-4617-9cb0-88e0854012ec-1
00:06:14.378 --> 00:06:15.530
circle.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.572
And draws a balloon, a red
balloon with a basket suspended

d6ff9f33-e890-4f79-8e9f-08298e65fd4c-1
00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:32.581
on a red basket suspended on red
ropes that takes her high above

d6ff9f33-e890-4f79-8e9f-08298e65fd4c-2
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:39.482
the tallest tower, peak tower of
the city, into the clouds. And

d6ff9f33-e890-4f79-8e9f-08298e65fd4c-3
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:46.383
there ahead of us. We see kind
of paddle wheel, airship driven,

d6ff9f33-e890-4f79-8e9f-08298e65fd4c-4
00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:50.049
Gray, and another little
balloon.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.400
Ship high above the clouds.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.706
Ah, there are a number. Here are
the fantastic aircraft

99d49766-b541-42dd-8b97-1ff6410cbfc9-1
00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:00.520
suspended.

95b2f002-e188-41a5-bc32-5e62b458c2d0-0
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.270
On.

992e9893-c854-443a-980d-cce0f35fe45f-0
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.120
What would you call those
cylindrical?

81964c0c-3e3d-4f77-9eb9-056dcd0cfd02-0
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.470
I bet there's a word for that
kind of. Anyway, there's

81964c0c-3e3d-4f77-9eb9-056dcd0cfd02-1
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.416
suspended on aircraft, suspended
on balloons, powered by paddle

81964c0c-3e3d-4f77-9eb9-056dcd0cfd02-2
00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:24.207
boats, and here, crossing the
scene, I see a purple bird with

81964c0c-3e3d-4f77-9eb9-056dcd0cfd02-3
00:07:24.207 --> 00:07:28.690
long, long tail feathers curving
behind it. {Next image.}

860002f6-9e7c-4edd-8ebb-6cd0bc3fc1de-0
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.174
Now we get a big full view of
that paddle wheeled airship with

860002f6-9e7c-4edd-8ebb-6cd0bc3fc1de-1
00:07:35.174 --> 00:07:39.200
its double smokestacks and the
gold. There's a gold.

7debd1f2-b70b-45e4-9971-9d45798b98a6-0
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:49.000
Dragon it looks like with wings
spread on the front and.

000fdf17-4722-4d28-8b01-d43fcaa91b96-0
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.181
Ah, on the airship has captured
the purple bird. They've cached

000fdf17-4722-4d28-8b01-d43fcaa91b96-1
00:07:56.181 --> 00:08:00.216
it somehow in one of the
airships has captured in the

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:04.550
lowered it into the big power
boat while the red balloon.

52461192-b7f9-48fe-8e35-d130ab5603c4-0
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.446
Young lady in the red balloon
watches, hovering nearby. {Next

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:18.104
He lands on the deck of the
airship, and we see her crossing

e4bb951d-edc5-4aae-8e23-98350ed4224c-1
00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:23.398
a Causeway toward a door into
one of the tunnels. And now we

e4bb951d-edc5-4aae-8e23-98350ed4224c-2
00:08:23.398 --> 00:08:28.866
see in that Golden Ark at the
that we know is that the prow of

e4bb951d-edc5-4aae-8e23-98350ed4224c-3
00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:34.421
this steamship, the bird in the
golden cage, is guarded between

e4bb951d-edc5-4aae-8e23-98350ed4224c-4
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:35.550
two soldiers.

5b1972af-aa2d-4efa-9c84-063108b79346-0
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.550
And climbing up.

c4c5e6b0-ebd1-4f1f-bbf1-443097a4a78a-0
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.498
Red Crayon in in her hand, just
reaching the top top of a ladder

c4c5e6b0-ebd1-4f1f-bbf1-443097a4a78a-1
00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:48.900
to the very peak, is our young
heroine.

15765e6f-b551-4154-a896-d12b61b4e0eb-0
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.009
She grabs the golden cage with
the Purple bird and runs with it

15765e6f-b551-4154-a896-d12b61b4e0eb-1
00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:03.236
while the guards, taken by
surprise, are shocked and begin

15765e6f-b551-4154-a896-d12b61b4e0eb-2
00:09:03.236 --> 00:09:04.920
to fall follow her.

77c7314d-b2ef-4210-8e3a-8269ba44b2da-0
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.624
She's out on the very tip, the
very front prow of the airship

77c7314d-b2ef-4210-8e3a-8269ba44b2da-1
00:09:12.624 --> 00:09:14.080
and the guards.

6e575795-526a-4c00-a0e6-add3aefc648c-0
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.575
Are just coming after her. But
she has released the Purple Bird

6e575795-526a-4c00-a0e6-add3aefc648c-1
00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:24.070
from its cage. It's taking off,
and she reaches to grab its tail

6e575795-526a-4c00-a0e6-add3aefc648c-2
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.565
feathers. {Next image.} Oh wait,
she's forgotten the red crayon?

6e575795-526a-4c00-a0e6-add3aefc648c-3
00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:28.980
Oh no.

e44b20b9-ff18-4f7e-927b-6cb7011c1a7e-0
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.310
The young lady is captured.

cd4afe18-8b17-4d41-b867-c640c46e8459-0
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.660
One of the guards throws her red
crayon off the prow and.

9c739bf0-4902-4b3c-8649-55178125202f-0
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.830
She is dragged away by two
soldiers.

1e4600ec-eec7-4fe7-b54f-1fd5bd3e12fd-0
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.563
Let me do that again. The young
lady is captured and dragged off

1e4600ec-eec7-4fe7-b54f-1fd5bd3e12fd-1
00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:54.670
the platform.

fe21ca77-9cd8-4226-a2dd-40de6ea56e77-0
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:01.921
While one of the soldiers, the
captain, drops the red crayon

fe21ca77-9cd8-4226-a2dd-40de6ea56e77-1
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:08.103
off the edge, and now we see
that our heroine is in a cage

fe21ca77-9cd8-4226-a2dd-40de6ea56e77-2
00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:11.980
suspended from the propeller of
the.

23f78882-7203-4a88-a04b-1044a68bb4d7-0
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.480
Airship.

6f5885c5-e140-48a2-a35b-952ca039d743-0
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.070
And two guards are lowering her
by a pulley. {Next.}

3596f23a-e0e3-4659-95f7-ca1ca656596a-0
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:30.350
But the purple bird with the red
crayon in its mouth swoops down

3596f23a-e0e3-4659-95f7-ca1ca656596a-1
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:36.526
to the cage while the young
woman leaps for joy. Crayon now,

3596f23a-e0e3-4659-95f7-ca1ca656596a-2
00:10:36.526 --> 00:10:43.005
she very he bends down with the
bird on her shoulder and begins

3596f23a-e0e3-4659-95f7-ca1ca656596a-3
00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:48.877
to draw a line, then a triangle,
then another line, now a

3596f23a-e0e3-4659-95f7-ca1ca656596a-4
00:10:48.877 --> 00:10:51.510
rectangle, while the bird.

ecd1ea13-839d-4faf-a40d-aff0c3246a06-0
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.140
Watches on. {next image.}

ae46f3a8-617f-4206-8402-11f1201a15b9-0
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.568
She draws for herself a flying
carpet, and on it we see her fly

ae46f3a8-617f-4206-8402-11f1201a15b9-1
00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:07.331
high above the city, leaving the
cage behind while the bird leads

ae46f3a8-617f-4206-8402-11f1201a15b9-2
00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:08.030
the way.

e6b6f69e-6bfd-4e02-8f8a-401c94a480a4-0
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:19.000
On the Starry night sky, we see
her flying on her red carpet.

ebba40d8-6122-46de-8e8f-7d71bbf56bb3-0
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.510
The bird far ahead.

21df7650-f477-402e-937b-111970e93322-0
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.580
In a beautiful scarlet purple
sky and desert.

31fceee9-af52-4113-ad6b-ef36efd73ba4-0
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.120
{Next.}

3e609889-6a1b-4171-b103-d18c9008d7a3-0
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.721
The little girl's landed and
stepped off the red magic carpet

3e609889-6a1b-4171-b103-d18c9008d7a3-1
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:50.281
with a crayon in her hand. She's
led toward a palm tree with a

3e609889-6a1b-4171-b103-d18c9008d7a3-2
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:54.870
Violet door, which the bird
stands Sentinel beside.

53741c37-bf38-4e7d-8912-eda588bc1936-0
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.790
The girl bends.

6fc321a7-d961-4ad3-884d-98716c6aa3a3-0
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.110
Turns the knob of the Violet
door, opens it, and the bird

6fc321a7-d961-4ad3-884d-98716c6aa3a3-1
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.943
flies in ahead of her. She
crawls after the bird through

6fc321a7-d961-4ad3-884d-98716c6aa3a3-2
00:12:06.943 --> 00:12:08.020
the Violet door.

2f2c90d7-1638-4bed-b995-f0729738dc12-0
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.770
She now we're back in the city.

42b499d1-1719-402b-a3cb-39e0543c149f-0
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.681
Young girl climbs out of a
mailbox with the red crayon in

42b499d1-1719-402b-a3cb-39e0543c149f-1
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:24.357
her hand and the purple bird
flies to be greeted by a young

42b499d1-1719-402b-a3cb-39e0543c149f-2
00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:27.320
boy with a purple crayon in his
hand.

6b160969-9c24-4e89-84ef-6ec6887bf0ae-0
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.241
The purple bird perches on the
boy's shoulder, and he helps the

6b160969-9c24-4e89-84ef-6ec6887bf0ae-1
00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:41.870
girl stand up. With her red
crayon She draws a circle.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.410
With his purple crayon, he draws
a purple circle.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:56.530
There's two circles. They make a
bicycle, a two seated bicycle.

802505ef-cfe5-43e4-a3cb-49e77bc36a04-0
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.143
And with the bird flying over
their shoulder, they head off

802505ef-cfe5-43e4-a3cb-49e77bc36a04-1
00:13:01.143 --> 00:13:02.890
down the city street.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.603
Yeah, that was very good. That
was 12 minutes and you finished

4595eb63-5929-477b-aaad-5cf91a3d71d4-1
00:13:08.603 --> 00:13:10.380

OK. So next one.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.140
Instead of a series of picture,
we just have one. Um, please

1c8583a2-9896-4cd5-987d-cf0bd554fc8e-1
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.260
take between three and five
minutes to describe what you

And you see.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.897
Crowded scene centered around a
triangle intersection in which

30d4985f-a1a5-481b-bc1d-bbb9205fc850-1
00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:55.260
several streets branch off into
side streets and different

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:01.078
colored buildings surround. Lots
of people and lots of activity

00:14:01.078 --> 00:14:03.260
here in these buildings.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.960
Starting at the bottom.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.944
And going across from the left,
there are window washers up

223d0dc6-4864-4918-ab17-7a366b9697d3-1
00:14:10.944 --> 00:14:14.751
washing, and in every window we
can see people going, someone

00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:18.190
walking in the door, people
walking by on the sidewalk.

61cbc90f-a29f-4975-baa0-8efb87fca5fd-0
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.262
Here in the Plaza there are
several booths set up and people

00:14:24.262 --> 00:14:29.285
around them. Dogs meeting dogs,
old folks on canes, a lot of

61cbc90f-a29f-4975-baa0-8efb87fca5fd-2
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:32.250
kids playing. Here's a plant
store.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.985
Several stripe tents and booths.
Rather, several striped awnings

88cc8b9f-3a6f-4b2a-9f85-a5752434b69f-1
00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:42.240
over the booths.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.203
Cars are moving around this
triangle intersection, and

9bd34556-f02e-4a9c-adb3-83ba475bd91e-1
00:14:48.203 --> 00:14:52.446
there's a fountain in the middle
of the section. There's even

00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:56.620
someone was with a mask and
flippers who's riding the top of

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.510
the fountain.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.410

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.393
It's a Macedonian warrior with
bow and arrow statue that's

7dd39476-97ce-4df0-84a2-38db8751d9f2-1
00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:14.220

Someone is receiving a medal.
Kids are riding bicycles. It

00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:38.810
looks like someone is coming out
of a manhole cover.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.907
It's like there may be some
drunks falling down here. I

507260d2-61f6-42f6-a743-5250f1c27e76-1
00:15:43.907 --> 00:15:46.650

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.731
But like I say, there's a lot
going on. There's a motorcycle

de6e0011-5133-4860-9c56-445020b39aec-1
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:57.050
racing through the intersection,
almost hitting a couple

de6e0011-5133-4860-9c56-445020b39aec-2
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.960
pedestrians.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.316
A window washer has dropped his
water and it's about to fall

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.610
#START_exhibit_12 This image is
of the great portrait image.

348331ab-314f-43c4-993f-277e3d4a0fc0-0
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:16.250
The Great Portrait exhibit and
it shows a crowd, a congestion

348331ab-314f-43c4-993f-277e3d4a0fc0-1
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.150
of people.

bb105cd2-3fcd-420d-ba42-564a7f5fb79e-0
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.840
On several levels of exhibit.

bfc22cef-26fd-46bc-9232-de1ae7b811f7-0
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:29.172
The walls are bright red, and
bright red is the dominant color

bfc22cef-26fd-46bc-9232-de1ae7b811f7-1
00:24:29.172 --> 00:24:34.454
of the pages. Against these
there are several gallery

bfc22cef-26fd-46bc-9232-de1ae7b811f7-2
00:24:34.454 --> 00:24:40.617
levels, mezzanine levels that
are reached by stairs. These are

bfc22cef-26fd-46bc-9232-de1ae7b811f7-3
00:24:40.617 --> 00:24:42.280
white mezzanines.

0e8837e7-e828-4868-903c-61f281cf83f9-0
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:48.087
And it seems there are several
levels of these, like a theater

0e8837e7-e828-4868-903c-61f281cf83f9-1
00:24:48.087 --> 00:24:52.458
with steps going up to each one.
It's so packed with people it's

0e8837e7-e828-4868-903c-61f281cf83f9-2
00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:55.620
hard to make out the contours of
the building.

d9a9d7ec-6647-4dec-a0bc-1e1cc6e5d3b7-0
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.230
Against the red walls there are.

47db4fbb-194e-4604-9756-d389b8f19ba0-0
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.540
Dozens of portraits.

0f507ad2-c59b-413f-9d95-aa3819116fc3-0
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.620
They're stacked on top of each
other.

7030749a-3062-44e2-825e-29457434f7d9-0
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:15.315
The people, as I say, are so
congested it's hard to make out

7030749a-3062-44e2-825e-29457434f7d9-1
00:25:15.315 --> 00:25:20.605
individual figures. Here's a
couple men hanging the portraits

7030749a-3062-44e2-825e-29457434f7d9-2
00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:26.152
who are tumbling off their their
ladder, it looks like. Portrait

7030749a-3062-44e2-825e-29457434f7d9-3
00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:31.528
of a clown. Another is a Dutch
gentleman in full array. Here's

7030749a-3062-44e2-825e-29457434f7d9-4
00:25:31.528 --> 00:25:33.320
a portrait of a king.

082578b6-4093-44e6-b617-6fc641cf2a05-0
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.110
There is Grant Wood's American
gothic.

60fa7e28-427a-426d-a377-c64f662d962d-0
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.180
Family portraits.

585419fa-de4f-47ae-bfa2-e6148543bf1c-0
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:50.626
Revolutionary War era. Ohh.
There are all sorts of figures

585419fa-de4f-47ae-bfa2-e6148543bf1c-1
00:25:50.626 --> 00:25:52.230
and faces. Uh.

7c757be9-f1d1-4958-bf12-fb3fe86d7ac5-0
00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:02.954
Not all the images are distinct
enough, and, as I say, the crowd

7c757be9-f1d1-4958-bf12-fb3fe86d7ac5-1
00:26:02.954 --> 00:26:04.300
every inch of.

db033494-7738-4c25-a98b-0e032d006caa-0
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.410
Photo.

c878368f-a1d0-4bac-a41a-b33e7e5d572b-0
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.671
And I cannot make out a whole
lot more than that.

c878368f-a1d0-4bac-a41a-b33e7e5d572b-1
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:13.560
#END_exhibit_12 Let's go to the
next image.

edb31ca2-d775-4101-9a5a-43b821566657-0
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.400
OK. So next item.

e3b7985b-5366-4801-8c75-6fff33172319-0
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.832
#START_escape_from_the_zoo This
image is illustration is called

e3b7985b-5366-4801-8c75-6fff33172319-1
00:26:45.832 --> 00:26:50.812
escape from the zoo and the
central action of a crowded zoo

e3b7985b-5366-4801-8c75-6fff33172319-2
00:26:50.812 --> 00:26:51.310
scene.

11af6bf1-40cf-488f-bdab-9ca887710d2c-0
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:54.470
Is what looks like.

d4a1e6fd-89ff-479c-8005-c744db071bc7-0
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.470
Escape of a two-horned
rhinoceros.

86b7cd8c-5877-4ca6-8786-5369fcbd1409-0
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.090
And.

37f4c577-584f-4caa-b7a2-fa133cae0cc8-0
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.668
I'm trying to see if there's
something on the rhinoceros'

37f4c577-584f-4caa-b7a2-fa133cae0cc8-1
00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:09.660
back. It looks like he has a
Penguin.

b6f820e0-9d15-4282-8ce5-845dc0ae1f52-0
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.980
Umm.

f5ed1979-82a4-4f09-a419-589f25ecc478-0
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.600
That may be extraneous to the
Stampede of the rhinoceros.

14f478c7-88c2-4d32-8b91-f8d782d7c650-0
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.980
Anyway, the rhinoceros is.

f6f8830c-a98a-4ed4-9836-e2344032237b-0
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.487
Making a Stampede down the main
Causeway at the lower right of

f6f8830c-a98a-4ed4-9836-e2344032237b-1
00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:33.859
our frame and we see the people
fleeing ahead of it. They're

f6f8830c-a98a-4ed4-9836-e2344032237b-2
00:27:33.859 --> 00:27:38.615
really quite panicky and
terrified and there's even a

f6f8830c-a98a-4ed4-9836-e2344032237b-3
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:42.490
snake people that's escaping the
scene and.

abb58a4e-ab38-4ca1-be53-16ab7304fa87-0
00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.550
It's hard to tell what's set
off.

6aa260ef-d319-417d-ac3f-5129bc484d02-0
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.990
The rhinoceros. I'm looking
behind it now.

df931b2c-ab99-4dd2-984c-4cc7fa5c2ac1-0
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.387
In the overlooking cage, the
Lions are watching watch,

df931b2c-ab99-4dd2-984c-4cc7fa5c2ac1-1
00:27:59.387 --> 00:28:04.615
overlooking the escape of the
rhinoceros with what looks like

df931b2c-ab99-4dd2-984c-4cc7fa5c2ac1-2
00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:06.470
envy and satisfaction.

39b77bce-d7a0-4115-a464-6f84216b3bb4-0
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.797
And also some of the kids are
jumping down into the lions cage

39b77bce-d7a0-4115-a464-6f84216b3bb4-1
00:28:14.797 --> 00:28:16.590
to escape the rhinoceros.

66edd0d7-5c31-4928-a336-7f5778da11cd-0
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.450
Behind us.

f7f9d8f5-7ac2-4163-909c-f4b8acb5b8a7-0
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:28.270
We see the rest of the zoo. Many
people are unaware of what's

f7f9d8f5-7ac2-4163-909c-f4b8acb5b8a7-1
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:33.627
going on. We see a lot of
strange creatures. There's an

f7f9d8f5-7ac2-4163-909c-f4b8acb5b8a7-2
00:28:33.627 --> 00:28:36.210
ice cream stand, a kind of.

5ea8f027-3765-40cc-be1d-7366641d12aa-0
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:45.981
A pond with the kind of ice ice
castle in it. At the top and

5ea8f027-3765-40cc-be1d-7366641d12aa-1
00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:51.650
back of the frame we see a
family of gorillas looking on.

78df2c7c-c5f2-4ecf-93ba-3718e2e5bdba-0
00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:58.413
A Penguin has somehow gotten
hold of a biplane and is flying

78df2c7c-c5f2-4ecf-93ba-3718e2e5bdba-1
00:28:58.413 --> 00:29:02.390
over the Antelope farm. A
parrot's got loose.

50bb19e6-b942-423c-bc3e-4bc3bc4299ce-0
00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:17.650
I think that's about all that's
significant. Lot. Lots of

50bb19e6-b942-423c-bc3e-4bc3bc4299ce-1
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:22.534
different exhibits. Zebras,
monkeys and the striped rhesus

50bb19e6-b942-423c-bc3e-4bc3bc4299ce-2
00:29:22.534 --> 00:29:27.583
monkeys are up at the top on a
tree, watching over the whole

50bb19e6-b942-423c-bc3e-4bc3bc4299ce-3
00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:31.060
spectacle.
#END_escape_from_the_zoo Next.

daa8c44b-8817-4b28-9c6b-c6375bd59c69-0
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.720
All right.

b6cb78d9-10b6-4097-a4cf-b05384cc9149-0
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.490
Keep going and try another item
like that.

79de8dc1-b18b-46e3-bcbc-40c64853e2ce-0
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.130
#START_being_a_pirate This image
is called being a pirate.

e254ce3b-0050-4f24-91c0-3aa3307e773d-0
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.460
And most of the drawing.

a45c1d68-a287-4e8a-b1e3-a1837a34c2b3-0
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.590
Is the water.

8504cef2-62f2-483d-b42b-97b5a35252ea-0
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:14.309
And we see the beach and land to
the very right of the sea. Water

8504cef2-62f2-483d-b42b-97b5a35252ea-1
00:30:14.309 --> 00:30:17.630
is crowded with ships and boats.

907e2c3e-f813-4871-9148-61da9de32288-0
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.360
There are two large rigged.

50fb3dd1-9980-4f79-8911-9195099f15c4-0
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.410
sailboats.

9214f18c-8743-4431-aeb2-0ec163147d32-0
00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.070
One of them has three masts, the
other two.

14537b57-dc65-493b-b811-dde5e8c99928-0
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:36.994
And off to one side we see half
of another boat that's flying

14537b57-dc65-493b-b811-dde5e8c99928-1
00:30:36.994 --> 00:30:40.470
the skull and crossbones of the
pirate craft.

8e156e01-1a82-41fe-8497-6baeb8b052f7-0
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:47.060
And these littler boats, the
crowd, the water seemed to be

8e156e01-1a82-41fe-8497-6baeb8b052f7-1
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.220
themselves, all pirates who are
surrounding and attacking the

8e156e01-1a82-41fe-8497-6baeb8b052f7-2
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.463
larger ship, the three masted
ship in the foreground, which is

8e156e01-1a82-41fe-8497-6baeb8b052f7-3
00:30:57.463 --> 00:31:02.540
trying, I believe, to fight them
off. And in fact we see yet

8e156e01-1a82-41fe-8497-6baeb8b052f7-4
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.700
another pirate ship by the skull
and crossbones. And on land.

f885d7d8-1ff5-4cac-b1ee-bd2443274ac4-0
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.632
It looks like there are
defending soldiers on land and

f885d7d8-1ff5-4cac-b1ee-bd2443274ac4-1
00:31:21.632 --> 00:31:23.040
some on the boats.

2640078d-184c-4a66-8dfc-8b95bd05f584-0
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.930
The upper right we see a number
of fighters who are blue and

2640078d-184c-4a66-8dfc-8b95bd05f584-1
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.931
white striped jerseys. Several
teams of them are on the boats

2640078d-184c-4a66-8dfc-8b95bd05f584-2
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:39.852
in the water, seeming to be
attacking the pirate boat at the

2640078d-184c-4a66-8dfc-8b95bd05f584-3
00:31:39.852 --> 00:31:44.530
top of the frame. And there are
many more on ship who are

2640078d-184c-4a66-8dfc-8b95bd05f584-4
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.870
dragging a boat to the water.

20f27c70-57c2-4dad-a8da-93552a9acba6-0
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.530
On the.

b93e2cc2-93ff-4121-aa3c-7e3872f65467-0
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.370
Ship itself.

1058319a-bdf3-4392-884a-9a0141b4a739-0
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.678
Big ship in the foreground. Most
of those sailors are blue and

1058319a-bdf3-4392-884a-9a0141b4a739-1
00:31:59.678 --> 00:32:04.102
white stripes, so they seem to
be defending the ship against

1058319a-bdf3-4392-884a-9a0141b4a739-2
00:32:04.102 --> 00:32:08.381
the pirates who are attacking
them. So there seems to be a

1058319a-bdf3-4392-884a-9a0141b4a739-3
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:11.500
double attack here of two
different ships.

9cdc324c-96b0-41f6-b946-c58fc1ecf7a0-0
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.810
Uh.

97729286-2ce3-4f4f-af29-0160f3660dc8-0
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.530
Or 1 ship and a number of
smaller ships there is.

b4f8fd71-345f-4c37-86a2-d2928a89144c-0
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:26.432

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:52.187
Uh, I noticed a little pirate
ship in the back that there is a

an illustration of the land of

the unfriendly giants.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.890
And we see, uh, a number of
scenes in this land.

8ad75d40-c80d-4a67-8dac-e2d2c978bf2a-0
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:17.516
The unfriendly giants are
harassing and tyrannizing the

8ad75d40-c80d-4a67-8dac-e2d2c978bf2a-1
00:34:17.516 --> 00:34:19.550

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:26.396
And we see a number of scenes of
the horrible treatment of the

7821c60b-644e-447f-97c2-42bf262f0b1b-1
00:34:26.396 --> 00:34:31.054
little people by the Giants. In
one group. The Giants are using

7821c60b-644e-447f-97c2-42bf262f0b1b-2
00:34:31.054 --> 00:34:33.530
them as figures on a chess
board.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.341
And the back end of one of the
Giants smacks down the host of

bd15c7b6-2a19-433d-98be-046f4de513bc-1
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:47.717
the little people who may have
been rebelling and trying to

00:34:47.717 --> 00:34:52.458
attack. And on the other side of
the chess board we see the same

bd15c7b6-2a19-433d-98be-046f4de513bc-3
00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:56.688
thing. One of the Giants is
smacking back on the troop of

bd15c7b6-2a19-433d-98be-046f4de513bc-4
00:34:56.688 --> 00:34:59.970
little people who are trying to
attack them.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.824
Here, on the other side of the
frame, the Giants drain the lake

669b28a6-d900-4e8f-9542-1a47d4299866-1
00:35:06.824 --> 00:35:11.701
with straws to shoot streams of
water on armies of the little

00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:16.657
people. Another giant pulls up a
tree to offer as a bouquet to

669b28a6-d900-4e8f-9542-1a47d4299866-3
00:35:16.657 --> 00:35:17.680

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.174
Another Giants pulled up the
tree and uses it a broom as a

00:37:42.838 --> 00:37:46.538
of people are hiking here,
someone blowing up a tent

e6ade0ae-f464-4b04-8ff6-a73dbc7b7071-2
00:37:46.538 --> 00:37:50.727
number. Tents are struck and
people are lounging in and out

e6ade0ae-f464-4b04-8ff6-a73dbc7b7071-3
00:37:50.727 --> 00:37:54.845
of them. Here's a tent that
seems to have collapsed around

e6ade0ae-f464-4b04-8ff6-a73dbc7b7071-4
00:37:54.845 --> 00:37:58.895
its occupants. People were
setting out on chairs in front

00:37:58.895 --> 00:38:00.780

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.427

were walking and as I say, I

00:38:04.427 --> 00:38:07.520

hedged actually several tables

00:38:13.783 --> 00:38:19.169

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.160
Troop of doctors with suitcases
it looks like.

4c71b836-a7a3-4251-a114-a69fd539fa14-0
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:24.319
And in the very back of the
scene, a man on a White Horse

4c71b836-a7a3-4251-a114-a69fd539fa14-1
00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:24.540
is.

fdf266f0-e120-453e-8ba6-898c9cef3fb5-0
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.390
Riding away into.

9a49ed7f-7a99-4bef-a158-640669f35ef1-0
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.070
A poster. A screen of the
sunset.

6043905b-4663-4d1d-a0d4-0f079c58000b-0
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:41.232
Breaking through a screen, it
looks like. There's a couple.

6043905b-4663-4d1d-a0d4-0f079c58000b-1
00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:45.857
Here's a sheriff chasing a
robber on the porch roof. Here,

6043905b-4663-4d1d-a0d4-0f079c58000b-2
00:41:45.857 --> 00:41:49.620
on another saloon roof, there's
a band playing.

f47c558d-efff-4851-a38a-91d4e7733b60-0
00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:55.913
What's the people on on the
roofs in these in here. In fact,

f47c558d-efff-4851-a38a-91d4e7733b60-1
00:41:55.913 --> 00:42:00.383
every roof seems to have
something going on and in every

f47c558d-efff-4851-a38a-91d4e7733b60-2
00:42:00.383 --> 00:42:03.520
balcony. #END_wild_west next
image, OK.

16dea660-4b8a-42dd-b840-389ef4dfc372-0
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:10.220
Well, that was about 2 minutes,
so tried to include a little

16dea660-4b8a-42dd-b840-389ef4dfc372-1
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:15.050
more detail for the next one,
but the next one is the story.

16dea660-4b8a-42dd-b840-389ef4dfc372-2
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.009
So we're aiming for 10 between
10 and 15 minutes.

48d11350-be1d-41e7-aa73-d9cabf379e9c-0
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:21.160
OK.

ce069a46-d06f-4856-9273-96c4b9fa08e7-0

#START_arrival_6 These
illustrations are done in sepia.

d1423b57-246f-4b7b-b683-240f222506f7-0
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.980
We see a bowl on a table next to
the window.

2aea1de2-03a3-4ee3-8ed0-917e6a84e135-0
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:08.620
And a wing creature.

6e7f6fbe-fba0-4691-8a15-89a1ea576583-0
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.310
With long.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.150
antenna like horns, pointed
horns, flying creature.

478bcda6-d8f5-459e-833c-7798b9181f05-0
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.230
Lands on the rim of the bowl.

1ca091e3-feca-4719-9d67-0ddbdb5d1b95-0
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:26.220
And then seems to disappear
inside.

22a3799d-6ce9-4498-9511-8dd7ed5043b5-0
00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:27.510
Hmm.

b13a5950-3894-4977-968c-916185d601d3-0
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:30.700
Through the window.

2ef8747b-d2f7-4776-9c07-2e820ea30bae-0
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.972
or the mirror it may be, we see
a man dipping a quill into right

2ef8747b-d2f7-4776-9c07-2e820ea30bae-1
00:43:37.972 --> 00:43:42.695
on the sheet of paper. He's
wearing a vest and there's a gas

2ef8747b-d2f7-4776-9c07-2e820ea30bae-2
00:43:42.695 --> 00:43:47.186
light beside him, and what we
see him do is fold the he's

2ef8747b-d2f7-4776-9c07-2e820ea30bae-3
00:43:47.186 --> 00:43:51.290
written on the sheet of paper.
Now he folds it into.

262357c5-3deb-4c08-9cbf-406db57e82eb-0
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.230
A bird.

f038e3d4-0a27-4c51-884b-f61ebcb6193e-0
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.680
And puts that bird into an
envelope along with some.

31fe6ad8-a16a-4fce-ba75-590b353af092-0
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:05.254
Coin, some Bills of money, licks
the envelope, puts on a stamp,

31fe6ad8-a16a-4fce-ba75-590b353af092-1
00:44:05.254 --> 00:44:06.200
walks down.

73c283c7-78d9-4639-9351-e8da9dccc265-0
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:12.166
Some stairs. A woman get a woman
with a basket gives him

73c283c7-78d9-4639-9351-e8da9dccc265-1
00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:17.241
directions. He by the way is
accompanied by what looks like a

73c283c7-78d9-4639-9351-e8da9dccc265-2
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:22.562
mouse like creature with a long
lizard like tail, fish like head

73c283c7-78d9-4639-9351-e8da9dccc265-3
00:44:22.562 --> 00:44:22.889
and.

c3dd64e8-6cf6-4134-b9f5-86885c674a53-0
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.540
fish fin Shaped growth on the
back of his head. She's carried

c3dd64e8-6cf6-4134-b9f5-86885c674a53-1
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:32.917
something in her basket. With a
curving tail. She points him to

c3dd64e8-6cf6-4134-b9f5-86885c674a53-2
00:44:32.917 --> 00:44:36.200
what turns out to be a winged
mail and conical.

c27acdda-6f82-4a96-98b2-b3d32857b830-0
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.220
Topped mailbox.

216ce673-c215-4659-873e-275ff37f505f-0
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.550
And he puts the letter into this
mailbox.

cd83de41-d0cb-47bb-8290-1dd0b463a88a-0
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:51.830
And we see him look up into the
sky now.

ee28e857-942d-440a-ac78-794f1365eee6-0
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.073
He's walking across the
landscape in which the trees are

ee28e857-942d-440a-ac78-794f1365eee6-1
00:44:58.073 --> 00:45:03.587
single leaves. Floating above
him is the mailbox on some

ee28e857-942d-440a-ac78-794f1365eee6-2
00:45:03.587 --> 00:45:07.070
circular ball like balloon.
That's.

f66dcfb0-c8d6-4739-a012-f942d5105ced-0
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.140
Floating away.

b0e54720-74f3-405d-9dff-ed62adc40886-0
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:12.600
OK, next.

7785485c-b430-4374-bd1f-726d22baecbd-0
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:15.950
Ah.

2a22fb9d-c55f-44a5-837b-f806318cee96-0
00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:23.930
In this series of panels we see
a single leaf that splits and

2a22fb9d-c55f-44a5-837b-f806318cee96-1
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:29.920
splits and divides and in the
center grows a curved tendril

2a22fb9d-c55f-44a5-837b-f806318cee96-2
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.520
which.

94c6336f-1254-4474-9e6e-cc0cf16da977-0
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:34.470
Grows up into a disc.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.490
Then the leaves.

0490c16e-cc72-4cd3-bb65-571769ee40fd-0
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.636
Die away, and the disc on its
single stock grows larger and

0490c16e-cc72-4cd3-bb65-571769ee40fd-1
00:45:44.636 --> 00:45:46.820
larger and out of its.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:53.290
Sunflower like segments, there
begin to issue birds.

2645b0ad-913e-48df-ab1f-98d8919d0814-0
00:45:54.950 --> 00:46:01.267
And it's filaments begin to come
apart like a dandelion and

2645b0ad-913e-48df-ab1f-98d8919d0814-1
00:46:01.267 --> 00:46:04.110
through a series of panels.

434e6fe0-a676-4cc1-b775-eec7e5c3d866-0
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:05.450
it.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.040
Out of its individual segments,
there appear and then grow a

afa832e1-8160-456b-b953-6ac40581a2aa-1
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.050
series of.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:27.941
Seeds like lemon seeds or
pomegranate seeds, and one by

f5c72ac1-a2dd-45af-ac3c-d9aa3a914608-1
00:46:27.941 --> 00:46:33.914
one these drop out onto the
ground and as the season

f5c72ac1-a2dd-45af-ac3c-d9aa3a914608-2

The six.

8f954f2c-873d-441a-a086-12c52abed20b-0
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:48.070
So it's got six. What are the
half circles? Anyway. The flower

8f954f2c-873d-441a-a086-12c52abed20b-1
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:52.760

It's segments until it becomes
lace like in the snow. {next

We're seeing.

61a45671-a09f-4aab-8244-426791485eb8-0
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:11.246
A fantastic city. A huge city
with giant walls and smokestacks

61a45671-a09f-4aab-8244-426791485eb8-1
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:16.527
and strange designs. The
rooftops are peaked and conical.

61a45671-a09f-4aab-8244-426791485eb8-2
00:47:16.527 --> 00:47:21.900
There are sweeping, swirling
shapes and in the background.

948a407a-0975-459c-bdc5-5efdb3f2316b-0
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:30.206
Number of furrowed hillsides and
wispy smoke tars, disappearing

948a407a-0975-459c-bdc5-5efdb3f2316b-1
00:47:30.206 --> 00:47:33.110
into the distance. {Next image.}

06b8cd22-a4f5-409e-822c-55d3d927b83e-0
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.928
We see again the pot that we saw
earlier, and out of it there

06b8cd22-a4f5-409e-822c-55d3d927b83e-1
00:47:42.928 --> 00:47:43.210
come.

6408f3c1-fb7f-403b-bafb-47b65a4b887c-0
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.430
1.

8aa18700-50ec-4037-8a42-dd153332f1cc-0
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.830
Bird like creature.

5f877dd2-8b49-4ba1-b9fd-3e521396b6c4-0
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:56.343
And behind it, the hungry mouths
of a series of chicks, three of

5f877dd2-8b49-4ba1-b9fd-3e521396b6c4-1
00:47:56.343 --> 00:48:02.914
them in all, and wing creature
returns to feed them. Now we see

5f877dd2-8b49-4ba1-b9fd-3e521396b6c4-2
00:48:02.914 --> 00:48:09.382
the room itself, a man who is
sitting on the end of his unmade

5f877dd2-8b49-4ba1-b9fd-3e521396b6c4-3
00:48:09.382 --> 00:48:16.056
bed, gazing at a family photo of
three figures. We see his desk,

5f877dd2-8b49-4ba1-b9fd-3e521396b6c4-4
00:48:16.056 --> 00:48:19.650
laundry hanging in the lines,
and.

6115f32f-ef82-45cd-b563-c90051ee11ad-0
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:26.315
In the window opening we see
that wing creature feeding its

6115f32f-ef82-45cd-b563-c90051ee11ad-1
00:48:26.315 --> 00:48:33.340
its chicks. Now we see the the
other animal that the fish like.

9a9516dd-fb66-4fd0-bd41-09deef9f9298-0
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:40.404
Thing with the long curving
tail. It seems to be waking from

9a9516dd-fb66-4fd0-bd41-09deef9f9298-1
00:48:40.404 --> 00:48:42.390
its its sleeping place.

9f729bc9-44ce-47e9-8099-41c86bcf965e-0
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:50.471
On the bed behind the man and it
wakens slips off the bed. The

9f729bc9-44ce-47e9-8099-41c86bcf965e-1
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:55.140
man looks back to see where it's
gone while it's gone down.

cc53fcf2-d0f7-4ffd-9286-67bb12551890-0
00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.846
What looks like an attic opening
with a ladder coming out. Now,

cc53fcf2-d0f7-4ffd-9286-67bb12551890-1
00:49:00.846 --> 00:49:04.873
the man climbs down the ladder
and his creature points to a

cc53fcf2-d0f7-4ffd-9286-67bb12551890-2
00:49:04.873 --> 00:49:08.968
letter that's come into the
mailbox, which he reaches. Picks

cc53fcf2-d0f7-4ffd-9286-67bb12551890-3
00:49:08.968 --> 00:49:09.640
up, opens.

5e8530eb-8471-4a3d-8470-9d360af97903-0
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:12.790
And finds inside.

c1a51317-458f-4177-a296-22ff9fc0bfcc-0
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:19.590
A folded paper bird, and he
reads a crumpled.

d0449d2f-6055-42f7-886e-3e1f6e42fb0b-0
00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:25.654
Crumpled paper, smiling. He's
happy with his message, and now,

d0449d2f-6055-42f7-886e-3e1f6e42fb0b-1
00:49:25.654 --> 00:49:30.555
with the paper still in his
hand, he looks out the window

d0449d2f-6055-42f7-886e-3e1f6e42fb0b-2
00:49:30.555 --> 00:49:35.626
and up into the sky. {Next
image} Here we see the crab like

d0449d2f-6055-42f7-886e-3e1f6e42fb0b-3
00:49:35.626 --> 00:49:40.697
folded paper with its four
folded feet and its curved tail.

d0449d2f-6055-42f7-886e-3e1f6e42fb0b-4
00:49:40.697 --> 00:49:41.120
Next.

cf858f3a-a378-4ac3-a038-abb5826b6b00-0
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.650
Next the.

0b49e88b-94ed-4dd9-9b95-0b4ad5b0fe56-0
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.309
Pyramid shaped top of an opening
that has dishes inside. Here's

0b49e88b-94ed-4dd9-9b95-0b4ad5b0fe56-1
00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:56.060
the coat rack with a hat and
coat.

5475b34b-4cbc-4b47-9492-70dbd9802e0d-0
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:04.162
Here's a dish with some sort of
strange vegetable or animal with

5475b34b-4cbc-4b47-9492-70dbd9802e0d-1
00:50:04.162 --> 00:50:11.347
curved tails. Here's a drawing
of an airship on paper, another

5475b34b-4cbc-4b47-9492-70dbd9802e0d-2
00:50:11.347 --> 00:50:12.259
utensil.

9037675f-00a1-4ab8-85d4-3c90aa318446-0
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:19.579
A a cup with a strange handle on
a on a folded napkin. Here's the

9037675f-00a1-4ab8-85d4-3c90aa318446-1
00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:24.476
family photo of mother, father
and daughter, and here's a hand

9037675f-00a1-4ab8-85d4-3c90aa318446-2
00:50:24.476 --> 00:50:25.720
that is putting.

c4b2b8d6-be64-4036-b2d1-33321a350ab2-0
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:32.937
Big coin into a child's open
hand. {Next image.} Here's the

c4b2b8d6-be64-4036-b2d1-33321a350ab2-1
00:50:32.937 --> 00:50:33.580
family.

ba3d0d58-704d-49a9-ab5c-66a5e75b9c48-0
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.883
Well, maybe a family at the
table. There's the mother,

ba3d0d58-704d-49a9-ab5c-66a5e75b9c48-1
00:50:40.883 --> 00:50:44.890
brother, older brother and
younger sister.

b212d6af-1aa5-457a-8bf9-d3630de3cd59-0
00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.570
The brother is holding up three
fingers.

3e7588e3-3803-409e-8596-c9f6beba8db1-0
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.765
So on their plates we see those
odd vegetable things. We see in

3e7588e3-3803-409e-8596-c9f6beba8db1-1
00:50:55.765 --> 00:51:00.000
fact all the items that we just
saw in the individual drawings.

fe504bcd-be9b-40a9-a17a-726b57e0dbdb-0
00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:06.880
Down at the bottom, grinning, is
the house pet.

6adf056b-694c-4b4e-839f-0cdbb49954d6-0
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.886
with the fish head and the
curved tail. Here we see the

6adf056b-694c-4b4e-839f-0cdbb49954d6-1
00:51:12.886 --> 00:51:18.012
little girl putting on her
boots. The fish head brings her

6adf056b-694c-4b4e-839f-0cdbb49954d6-2
00:51:18.012 --> 00:51:23.226
her knit cap, tasseled cap,
which she then puts on and with

6adf056b-694c-4b4e-839f-0cdbb49954d6-3
00:51:23.226 --> 00:51:28.440
the animal accompanying her they
go down the steps outside.

1fe261d1-ae5a-4a8e-bade-ae913f721fcb-0
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.860
And we see them.

c701d6a2-fa0e-46eb-96f8-d933cf96e046-0
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.860
Seeing bright.

e7972d58-3c0b-45d9-962a-aed491b35183-0
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.770
Seedlings, bright seeds or
bright.

195ff121-a569-4401-ae8d-1d44bc878b03-0
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:48.221
Items on the ground, on the
ground points at them, and then

195ff121-a569-4401-ae8d-1d44bc878b03-1
00:51:48.221 --> 00:51:52.705
it seems to lift one up into the
air, where it shines

195ff121-a569-4401-ae8d-1d44bc878b03-2
00:51:52.705 --> 00:51:55.860
beautifully. #END_arrival_6 OK,
good.

04a523f1-fab5-4208-a2bf-e39d37c4b680-0
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.020
Items.

1335a2c6-053f-4faf-906c-888aff75b3a1-0
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:05.460
And then this is another story.
It's about 20 pages. Ohh golly.

8c7c1725-f572-45c8-8b8a-c9d92490fa1b-0
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.710
#START_return We see a cross
section view of the House.

55aea02a-6161-425b-a6ae-8ae711c0926a-0
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.380
Uh.

6b9601cb-789e-438c-a63c-ebd8a273a942-0
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:25.338
The entryway is empty and the
kitchen is empty, but upstairs

6b9601cb-789e-438c-a63c-ebd8a273a942-1
00:52:25.338 --> 00:52:31.975
dad is at his drawing board in
shorts and we see a red kite

6b9601cb-789e-438c-a63c-ebd8a273a942-2
00:52:31.975 --> 00:52:36.290
that seems to be floating in the
door.

10b8f047-5989-407a-a764-7b9dbe5f8f54-0
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:42.830
And into the next room and down
the stairs.

3eeedeef-516f-4124-95c5-49c184bd8112-0
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:50.822
Uh, the other occupant in the
house is downstairs at the other

3eeedeef-516f-4124-95c5-49c184bd8112-1
00:52:50.822 --> 00:52:57.435
side. And there a young girl
wearing a crown is drawing a

3eeedeef-516f-4124-95c5-49c184bd8112-2
00:52:57.435 --> 00:53:04.390
door with Red Crayon on the wall
of her bedroom. Also in in.

fe4844f0-9e8e-4468-af35-eab3d09dcda0-0
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:11.820
The room under her arm there is
a red bowling ball.

a478432e-f7cc-434c-907f-805f2edec1dc-0
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:16.170
Hanging from the ceiling is a.

4067d67e-1f50-418b-aa3c-ce1e7df21dd1-0
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.370
Red Ball balloon with a.

4c399dd1-91d8-4a42-92d9-6a64660ace9a-0
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:29.410
With a passenger basket, small,
also hanging from the ceiling.

dd23ee35-d07a-4860-b369-5617fc07b00e-0
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.640
There is something purple.

3d012a85-f36d-46da-b55c-d99c40234c91-0
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.740
Which is the same Violet color,
Violet color as.

84b15366-2649-4f50-b117-8a0aa4846005-0
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:40.700
A shape on the bed.

6ac1faf1-1ddf-4af8-aa4d-69bc0cd4b7df-0
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:46.410
I think that's gonna be that
bird, but let's go on, OK?

8f6bdcbb-d345-41e4-8bf0-58764d32ccb1-0
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.978
Dad and his drawing board turns
around and sees the red kite on

8f6bdcbb-d345-41e4-8bf0-58764d32ccb1-1
00:53:53.978 --> 00:53:54.570
the floor.

854df391-b307-43e8-ac7b-3100f2a735ca-0
00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:58.740
Gets up, crouches this down and
picks it up.

71b88750-f3c6-4d4b-b162-e97e9bbdf205-0
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.071
Then he leaves it there. He goes
downstairs into the room that

71b88750-f3c6-4d4b-b162-e97e9bbdf205-1
00:54:07.071 --> 00:54:12.034
the girl was just left, and
looks through the open red door

71b88750-f3c6-4d4b-b162-e97e9bbdf205-2
00:54:12.034 --> 00:54:14.930
where she has perhaps
disappeared.

94b74978-f067-4c34-918b-99fecbc002cb-0
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:21.910
No. Yes. He comes through the
door into a lighted forest.

a7d81c1d-8f5a-4ede-a5c9-cacfd9b9c06b-0
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:27.967
Tall, tall trees and at the end
of the pier in the next frame we

a7d81c1d-8f5a-4ede-a5c9-cacfd9b9c06b-1
00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:29.800
see the red volleyball.

60b24321-6b87-4fad-81a3-3f3cb252a0c8-0
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:35.740
At the end of a wood pier at the
edge of the stream.

0f9bfc6f-8c78-42bb-a9fc-82d2f4d8ec1d-0
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:44.293
Dad goes out and picks up the
volleyball and coming around the

0f9bfc6f-8c78-42bb-a9fc-82d2f4d8ec1d-1
00:54:44.293 --> 00:54:49.751
curve of the stream is a dragon
headed Viking boat. It comes to

0f9bfc6f-8c78-42bb-a9fc-82d2f4d8ec1d-2
00:54:49.751 --> 00:54:52.309
the pier. He gets on the boat.

17dea212-b108-466f-8b74-321e36f8e597-0
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.860
And it takes him to a huge to
the.

038a232a-544e-42f4-bcca-c4ed7141c063-0
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:08.304
Open gates of a large castle
with many towers and a domed

038a232a-544e-42f4-bcca-c4ed7141c063-1
00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:13.030
domed roofs. In the next frame
we see him.

b3ea95ba-4c42-4174-89d6-41b4f81893e4-0
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:17.570
Drifting across the Causeway or
no?

db42e208-34a5-4938-95e2-0844c5d0d045-0
00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.900
He excuse me, he's looking.

69f33898-e5c5-4dec-aebc-a24c58fa8288-0
00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.890
He has his hand up to his eyes,
looking ahead, and what he sees

69f33898-e5c5-4dec-aebc-a24c58fa8288-1
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.820
on a red boat going across the
Causeway is the little girl.

fa56a13f-06a1-4516-82e4-e19253c7e443-0
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.080
Who

a944e8d3-45aa-439c-8a73-8ce86f65a497-0
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.396
Went through the door ahead of
him. Above the scene is a full

a944e8d3-45aa-439c-8a73-8ce86f65a497-1
00:55:36.396 --> 00:55:38.240
moon over a beautiful sky.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:49.350

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.020
The pier.

the purple bird which is flying

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:32.790
I don't know how to describe
this. I see in this scene, dad.

aede5096-46fe-4196-964f-593afd0fd35d-0

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.750
Running toward them.

83fb5bfd-0946-4f75-abef-d370bcfe7679-3

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.080
OK, moving on to the next item.
It is a complex scene.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:08.561
So please take between three and
five minutes to just describe

This scene is called dinosaurs,

Left side, upper side, there's a
mixture. Well, they're mixed in

Cavemen.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.080
There seem to be real people
here too, but there's also a lot

70d4daf6-1504-45a7-810e-cdf319c99d7a-1
01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.710

Are the spaceships.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.450
Though it's strange they seem to
be against.

6d830078-bea0-4518-b071-41cbc3f18136-0
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:41.120
A framework background drop like
a stage setting and the flying

6d830078-bea0-4518-b071-41cbc3f18136-1
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.530
saucer seem to be hanging from
cables with the pulleys on them.

01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:56.131
And a lot of them seem I see
signs of film, cameras and

3d958335-2a8f-4449-8118-83d8a6c18b60-1
01:07:56.131 --> 01:07:56.900

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:07.440
Film production, yes, because
the buildings across the bottom

22b41029-1626-40af-a89c-f40238c2fb3e-1
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:12.537
of the frame are all sets.
They're all single wall or

22b41029-1626-40af-a89c-f40238c2fb3e-2
01:08:12.537 --> 01:08:15.840
double wall kinds of
construction.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:27.193
And in one of them here, I see
actors who are making up in

625a2c88-8d10-4950-a649-a53184e7027a-1
01:08:27.193 --> 01:08:28.730

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:45.757
And there are a lot of technical
people along with the cameras.

7b190972-376d-4c6b-962e-b97d530c1b50-1
01:08:45.757 --> 01:08:47.510
Over here is another set.

01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.140
This is a cafeteria.

01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:56.620
And it may in fact, be the film
technicians. Real cafeteria.

7b5a445a-4a07-47aa-a078-d8cdb82e1e6b-1
01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.833
There are Cavemen waiting in
line and spacemen sitting at

01:09:35.506 --> 01:09:39.250
we're at a water park with a lot
of slides and rides.

We're asked to find 10 Penguins
here.

01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:49.720
Amongst all of these people.

d41dd739-d3b5-471f-aff5-c0aa5f7c0cbe-0
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.631
This is a very integrated scene.
There are a number of people of

d41dd739-d3b5-471f-aff5-c0aa5f7c0cbe-1

mixed together, different

01:10:06.562 --> 01:10:11.622
costumes, kids and older people,
and we see a lot of people

076841b8-9a7f-4f76-95ee-54573a297fe9-2
01:10:11.622 --> 01:10:16.430

01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:27.884
riding what look like wafers or
circles on floats and diving off

01:10:27.884 --> 01:10:28.310

a lot of kids are riding,

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:44.358
inflatable sea serpent and some
very large beach balls, some of

01:10:44.358 --> 01:10:47.090
them bigger than people
themselves.

their dinner. The items look

01:14:00.932 --> 01:14:02.110
very strange.

01:14:18.207 --> 01:14:24.514
We see a series of images of
them around the table laughing.

01:14:24.514 --> 01:14:30.820
Dad plays an accordion like
instrument. Mom plays what looks

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.060

The frame is coming into color
shutters here and there.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.920
There is a family in black and
white who are moving out.

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:44.020
And there one of their awnings
is half in color.

01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:53.102
It seems to be that color has
moved into the neighborhood that

01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:08.862
And brought it back to life. And
the color is now spreading

87c7360e-b3f6-4fe4-ad0b-b8b0f4683910-1
01:23:08.862 --> 01:23:13.686
around the neighborhood. There's
a fire plug. {Go back a second,

There's that little girl who's
hugging.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.000
Someone. Look on the left there.
She's hugging our old man.

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.020
Something.

Here's a couple dancing on the
street. People are out.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.152
It seems the color has spread
over the whole neighborhood,

82bf5afe-46b2-4164-afcc-02cb89a8218b-1
01:23:59.152 --> 01:24:03.458
that all of the awnings and the
roofs, the shutters, have come

someone playing a guitar

Ah, it's gone night. And the
whole scene is in color and

01:24:33.436 --> 01:24:34.670
richly detailed.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.661
I see old man and what looked
like his grandchildren looking

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.130
A number of people are out on
their roofs today, the man in

01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:55.360

The artist where is he?

It's night time and we're in the
same city, but from a different

There are many people out on the

01:25:53.319 --> 01:25:56.590

unfamiliar intersection.

Out on the street at night.

01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:02.659
He's carrying what looks like a
large potato with labels on it.

29cd0e4c-c84b-4257-b83d-9c36c1c7af84-1
01:27:02.659 --> 01:27:08.501
Maybe it's, but it's a valise of
some kind of football shaped

valise and it does have patches
on it. He's holding what looks

01:27:27.713 --> 01:27:31.656
surprised, a pipe smoking man
with glasses and a bow tie.

surprise of some kind.
