00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.610
Please.

cde0dbb5-130d-4b04-ae32-48ecef888d89-0
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.575
Right. So in this study you
will see two types of pictures.

cde0dbb5-130d-4b04-ae32-48ecef888d89-1
00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:12.672
The first type that you'll see
is graphic novels in a graphic

cde0dbb5-130d-4b04-ae32-48ecef888d89-2
00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:13.330
novels.

e0b29cc9-73b0-49ee-87d3-cbf49091dbe8-0
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.039
There are serious pictures that
tells a story. So imagine you're

e0b29cc9-73b0-49ee-87d3-cbf49091dbe8-1
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.328
telling this story that someone
who cannot see the pictures.

e0b29cc9-73b0-49ee-87d3-cbf49091dbe8-2
00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:27.687
Describe what you see and what
is happening as you go through

e0b29cc9-73b0-49ee-87d3-cbf49091dbe8-3
00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:30.710
the story. Each story is around
30 pages.

dedad47c-0577-467f-bec2-3b1c4108aff4-0
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.720
And please aim between 10 and
15 minutes to tell this story.

be7bb433-15c9-422e-8349-dd611d71c04a-0
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.280
OK, when you're ready, we can
start.

0f21c3f3-fceb-44a2-a0d1-5fc2007731c9-0
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.238
#START_journey Let's see. So it
looks like some children are

0f21c3f3-fceb-44a2-a0d1-5fc2007731c9-1
00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:57.862
playing and they are giving
themselves high fives on one

0f21c3f3-fceb-44a2-a0d1-5fc2007731c9-2
00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:02.891
part of the picture and it looks
like there is a bicycle. And

0f21c3f3-fceb-44a2-a0d1-5fc2007731c9-3
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:07.840
they are. One child is on a
bicycle. One child looks like he

0f21c3f3-fceb-44a2-a0d1-5fc2007731c9-4
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.113
has a piece of chalk, like he's
ready to draw a picture with the

0f21c3f3-fceb-44a2-a0d1-5fc2007731c9-5
00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:13.600
chalk.

9eb20105-7403-45e4-8b22-48f807aa794f-0
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.007
There's another little girl that
is sitting on the steps and she

9eb20105-7403-45e4-8b22-48f807aa794f-1
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:25.170
has her head on her knees. She
looks a little bit sad and.

4d721180-df8f-4e52-9c8d-2182fe5dceac-0
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.169
We are also, we're looking at a
street scene in one area with a

4d721180-df8f-4e52-9c8d-2182fe5dceac-1
00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:34.025
stop light and I was talking
about the children that are

4d721180-df8f-4e52-9c8d-2182fe5dceac-2
00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.881
playing outside. We're also
seeing a part of a house and

4d721180-df8f-4e52-9c8d-2182fe5dceac-3
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:38.220
it's.

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-0
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.330
We're looking inside the house.
It is almost like the House is

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-1
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.760
cut in half so that we can see
what people are doing inside the

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-2
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.705
House that looks like there is a
mother possibly cooking

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-3
00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:56.204
something on the stove. And then
upstairs it looks like possibly

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-4
00:01:56.204 --> 00:02:00.495
the father is looking onto a
computer and doing some work and

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-5
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:04.924
it looks like there is a person,
maybe a young person laying on

f77b9253-d045-43a0-88fd-fbc206aa09bb-6
00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:08.870
the couch. And it is all that I
can say right now about.

38b49b2b-8a6d-4777-955a-342bdae07f33-0
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.460
The scene OK.

2d5e80ba-dd75-4e3c-8c87-af6289444a8b-0
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.822
And the second page shows a
little bit more detail about

2d5e80ba-dd75-4e3c-8c87-af6289444a8b-1
00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:21.706
what is going on in the House.
It looks like the mother is

2d5e80ba-dd75-4e3c-8c87-af6289444a8b-2
00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:25.919
stirring something on the stove
in a pot, and it looks like the

2d5e80ba-dd75-4e3c-8c87-af6289444a8b-3
00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.000
little girl is possibly looking
into the sink. That's hard to

2d5e80ba-dd75-4e3c-8c87-af6289444a8b-4
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.700
say. She is leaning against the
counter.

47cbfd7c-ab47-4adc-8f5c-d2aab6e5457c-0
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.090
And.

11cd8075-c1fb-4ae9-9a24-a928d7e8ee95-0
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.262
But there is another picture of
that looks like the father is

11cd8075-c1fb-4ae9-9a24-a928d7e8ee95-1
00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:43.816
looking into the computer and
possibly a young daughter with a

11cd8075-c1fb-4ae9-9a24-a928d7e8ee95-2
00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:48.370
kite who is leaning against the
chair. It looks like she wants

11cd8075-c1fb-4ae9-9a24-a928d7e8ee95-3
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.997
the father to come and fly the
kite with her, and she also then

11cd8075-c1fb-4ae9-9a24-a928d7e8ee95-4
00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:57.262
goes down to where her older
sister is lying on the couch.

11cd8075-c1fb-4ae9-9a24-a928d7e8ee95-5
00:02:57.262 --> 00:03:00.660
And it's hard for me to see
exactly what that.

2e2ab894-c94d-4afd-9d71-f95a3bb8717c-0
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.110
Maybe the

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-0
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.522
It looks like she is looking
into a camera, but it's hard for

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-1
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:12.066
me to tell from this angle. But
again, it looks like the the

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-2
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.552
little girl is going along to
each member of her family and

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-3
00:03:15.552 --> 00:03:19.386
trying to get them to go out and
play with her, but it looks like

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-4
00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:23.047
they won't. So she goes off into
her bedroom and it looks like

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-5
00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:26.649
she is very dejectedly sitting
on her bed alone. And there is

32722c41-fc30-4f2b-b9a1-e995ecf54b18-6
00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.379
also a cat in her bedroom laying
on the floor.

fc0f77e9-6769-4405-a388-fa9d7965be04-0
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.950
{OK, ready to go to the next
line?}

ae901f33-6b0b-42cb-a339-876010519c0b-0
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.848
In the next scene, the little
girl is looks like she's getting

ae901f33-6b0b-42cb-a339-876010519c0b-1
00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:44.023
up off the bed. The cat has
decided to get up and is going

ae901f33-6b0b-42cb-a339-876010519c0b-2
00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.429
out the door to the outdoors
and.

d91c9c67-52a2-48de-b736-945ddbd0b465-0
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.340
The young lady, it looks like
she's taking something to draw

d91c9c67-52a2-48de-b736-945ddbd0b465-1
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.629
with, and some papers. She's
drawing something on the wall of

d91c9c67-52a2-48de-b736-945ddbd0b465-2
00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.057
her. Oh, I see what she's doing.
She's drawing something on the

d91c9c67-52a2-48de-b736-945ddbd0b465-3
00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:04.416
wall of her bedroom, which is
actually a door. She's imagining

d91c9c67-52a2-48de-b736-945ddbd0b465-4
00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:08.706
a door, and she's going out of
the door. She has drawn a door

d91c9c67-52a2-48de-b736-945ddbd0b465-5
00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.090
and she's going out.

a3eb07ad-a1b9-4529-9c0c-b30ce8a59c5e-0
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.210
{And that's all I have to say
about this photo.}

0b765268-0c66-4c78-8ae6-4ac42a32b552-0
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.018
In her imagination she has come
out of a door in a tree trunk

0b765268-0c66-4c78-8ae6-4ac42a32b552-1
00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:26.221
and she is looking in amazement
at a number of lights in the

0b765268-0c66-4c78-8ae6-4ac42a32b552-2
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:31.851
forest that are strung along the
trees and beautiful lanterns and

0b765268-0c66-4c78-8ae6-4ac42a32b552-3
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:37.054
a like a little stream going
through the woods with a number

0b765268-0c66-4c78-8ae6-4ac42a32b552-4
00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:42.258
of trees in the forest. But the
main thing are the beautiful

0b765268-0c66-4c78-8ae6-4ac42a32b552-5
00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:44.220
lights that are strung.

42464247-1e3e-4ed7-85d1-6cfcf9e29564-0
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.930
Throughout the forest and the
beautiful lanterns.

ea76be14-e5b8-4c96-a4b5-74325794dad8-0
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.065
She walks up onto a little dock
that goes on to a stream and she

ea76be14-e5b8-4c96-a4b5-74325794dad8-1
00:04:57.065 --> 00:05:03.036
still has her colorful truck in
her hand and she's looking down

ea76be14-e5b8-4c96-a4b5-74325794dad8-2
00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:03.690
at her.

1241a96f-8e04-4336-8c1d-980428063226-0
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.521
In the image, which is reflected
into the stream again, she's in

1241a96f-8e04-4336-8c1d-980428063226-1
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:12.180
the beautiful forest, with the
lamps hanging around in the

1241a96f-8e04-4336-8c1d-980428063226-2
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.220
trees and the lights that are
strung throughout.

04caf7db-f2e5-446d-a78f-f43e4f2c43e5-0
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.757
She draws off the side of the
dock about and she jumps into

04caf7db-f2e5-446d-a78f-f43e4f2c43e5-1
00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:23.270
the boat and starts floating
away.

9349688d-80c0-403a-b649-5b37b8b7057a-0
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.655
As she floats away, she goes
toward a big castle, which has

9349688d-80c0-403a-b649-5b37b8b7057a-1
00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:37.240
many different moats and towers,
and it's actually surrounded by

9349688d-80c0-403a-b649-5b37b8b7057a-2
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.826
a Moat and she is headed in that
direction. It is fascinating to

9349688d-80c0-403a-b649-5b37b8b7057a-3
00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:48.411
see all of the different towers
and the domes, and it looks like

9349688d-80c0-403a-b649-5b37b8b7057a-4
00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:50.130
a very large castle.

7bb1df30-2d01-4060-92cc-2f96658e3b62-0
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.290
It's interesting because the
little boat seems to take her.

c5b4ced1-cd1d-4a57-9423-92ecd8c1ea66-0
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.170
Throughout the castle. It's
almost like.

d067e0d6-0958-4ae6-a82f-99466092bfc1-0
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.172
The pathways in the castle are
made of water and her boat is

d067e0d6-0958-4ae6-a82f-99466092bfc1-1
00:06:07.172 --> 00:06:12.277
taking her towards the castle
with a number of that looks like

d067e0d6-0958-4ae6-a82f-99466092bfc1-2
00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:17.138
possibly guards and then that
are waving to her as she goes

d067e0d6-0958-4ae6-a82f-99466092bfc1-3
00:06:17.138 --> 00:06:22.486
towards the middle of the castle
area. There are also some men on

d067e0d6-0958-4ae6-a82f-99466092bfc1-4
00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:27.591
gondolas loading on different
parts of the path. {That's all I

d067e0d6-0958-4ae6-a82f-99466092bfc1-5
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:29.860
have to say about this one.}

134b8dc4-adb0-4f13-bc24-f2d86f3d42ec-0
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.886
All of a sudden as she's going
along one of these water filled

134b8dc4-adb0-4f13-bc24-f2d86f3d42ec-1
00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:43.000
paths, her boat comes to the
edge of a waterfall and it looks

134b8dc4-adb0-4f13-bc24-f2d86f3d42ec-2
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.783
like as she comes to that
waterfall she then draws a rope

134b8dc4-adb0-4f13-bc24-f2d86f3d42ec-3
00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:52.897
that she can hang on to and her
boat flies away and she flies

134b8dc4-adb0-4f13-bc24-f2d86f3d42ec-4
00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:53.970
into the air.

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-0
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.451
and it ends up those ropes that
she draws ends up being a large

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-1
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:05.597
balloon, a hot air balloon,
which takes her away and we see

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-2
00:07:05.597 --> 00:07:09.674
the guards waving to her off one
of the tall towers of the

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-3
00:07:09.674 --> 00:07:13.750
castle. We see the clouds that
she's flying through and it

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-4
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.688
looks like she's going towards
some other type of flying

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-5
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:21.696
contraption that I have never
seen before. A very unusual

8364bd27-ec22-4d16-8300-5cd9fcfd725a-6
00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:24.459
looking thing. So we'll see
where that.

98a71c59-c509-45ef-b5a5-489a50a1cd3b-0
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.850
Like this possibly in the next
page.

f30f46e7-1a20-4461-b4b6-7532b9ae6b9d-0
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.625
Seems she is looking over to
this other contraption and it

f30f46e7-1a20-4461-b4b6-7532b9ae6b9d-1
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.910
looks like it's some amazing
flying machine.

604d40d7-00d1-4d73-b35b-7a30268a0123-0
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.109
The edge of one of the machines
is a person with a net who is

604d40d7-00d1-4d73-b35b-7a30268a0123-1
00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:47.676
trying to catch a beautiful
purple bird and he seeing held

604d40d7-00d1-4d73-b35b-7a30268a0123-2
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:52.552
on to so that he doesn't fly off
this unusual contraption. And

604d40d7-00d1-4d73-b35b-7a30268a0123-3
00:07:52.552 --> 00:07:57.661
there are two other very unusual
looking contraptions just flying

604d40d7-00d1-4d73-b35b-7a30268a0123-4
00:07:57.661 --> 00:08:02.074
through the air. They look like
dirigibles and they have

604d40d7-00d1-4d73-b35b-7a30268a0123-5
00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:05.480
propellers on them, something
very unusual.

1c48fb05-716f-4741-a2e3-24207748c355-0
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.960
And I've never seen before.

895b810c-493a-4182-9c86-10254b41deff-0
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.853
Yes, and as she's flying along
on her hot air balloon, it looks

895b810c-493a-4182-9c86-10254b41deff-1
00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:19.175
like she is going to possibly
land on one of these

895b810c-493a-4182-9c86-10254b41deff-2
00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:21.040
contraptions and it's.

ef5b8e40-5d49-4a6b-9bf1-92fd041a711f-0
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.910
A very amazing looking thing.
It. I can't even describe it.

ef5b8e40-5d49-4a6b-9bf1-92fd041a711f-1
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.024
It's so amazing looking. I've
never seen anything like it. It

ef5b8e40-5d49-4a6b-9bf1-92fd041a711f-2
00:08:30.024 --> 00:08:30.290
has.

84bb1bd5-d3f7-4b3a-aa51-d0316cbf1147-0
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.240
All kinds of little wheels.

af856850-363c-4a15-9a12-e1b7c321d317-0
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.977
Turning and beautiful designed
parts a little. It looks like a

af856850-363c-4a15-9a12-e1b7c321d317-1
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:43.964
little golden eagle on the top
of one of the parts. It's just

af856850-363c-4a15-9a12-e1b7c321d317-2
00:08:43.964 --> 00:08:48.951
almost an unimaginable to me
what this thing is. We'll see if

af856850-363c-4a15-9a12-e1b7c321d317-3
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:53.456
we can find out more as the
story continues on. OK, her

af856850-363c-4a15-9a12-e1b7c321d317-4
00:08:53.456 --> 00:08:54.100
balloon.

260dd308-1af6-47b6-930f-5420564a449e-0
00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:00.200
Comes down onto this amazing
contraption and she's running,

260dd308-1af6-47b6-930f-5420564a449e-1
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.570
running, running along the
pathway and I'm seeing some sort

260dd308-1af6-47b6-930f-5420564a449e-2
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.450
of bridges on top of.

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-0
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.389
With some people walking along
on the top of this contraption,

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-1
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:16.436
it's unclear how she's going to
get to them. But there is a

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-2
00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:20.146
little doorway, and I think
she's probably going to go

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-3
00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:24.194
through that doorway and it
looks like she's going to climb

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-4
00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:28.174
up a ladder to the top of one of
the towers on top of this

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-5
00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:32.288
contraption. And it looks like
there are two guards and they

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-6
00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:36.268
are guarding a little purple
bird in a golden cage, and on

28c00d93-64cf-4d64-9836-83eceeab87d0-7
00:09:36.268 --> 00:09:38.090
top of this contraption is.

b14ed94a-b9f4-4aef-a0ac-8f22f6925d7d-0
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.500
OK.

3516105f-4cc9-4507-9b1d-5b60ccd5f802-0
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.950
A golden dragon.

e15935f6-a161-4476-8dbe-66aeb4786c32-0
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:46.580
And it looks like almost like a
pagoda top anyways, OK.

04dddef2-8ce2-4f5e-a3e6-faf6aa173c28-0
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.350


0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-0
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.918
She grabs the bird. She grabs
the bird in the cage and runs,

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-1
00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:58.819
and the guards are shocked and
they don't know what to do. It

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-2
00:09:58.819 --> 00:10:02.153
looks like they're just so
shocked that they're just

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-3
00:10:02.153 --> 00:10:06.180
jumping in the air like, Oh my
goodness, what has happened? And

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-4
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.767
as it continues on, she goes to
the edge of this amazing

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-5
00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:13.668
contraption and she lets the
bird out of the cage to fly into

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-6
00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:17.254
the air and the guards are
coming after her and it looks

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-7
00:10:17.254 --> 00:10:20.715
like there are a number of
guards within the inside of

0d9c5204-6acd-4987-aa1f-b16e84155c73-8
00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:21.030
this.

683d5516-a460-46e4-87b3-cb92a63c7403-0
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.155
Amazing contraption and they are
all getting ready to come after

683d5516-a460-46e4-87b3-cb92a63c7403-1
00:10:25.155 --> 00:10:25.380
her.

b003cb14-17f9-47f2-af01-1ca6e0a04776-0
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.220
And they've captured her, it
looks like and.

37fae6c4-895d-413a-a96b-a145cdd739a4-0
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.671
They have put her into a little
cage and they are turning a

37fae6c4-895d-413a-a96b-a145cdd739a4-1
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:42.487
wheel to set the cage down,
down, down, away from this

37fae6c4-895d-413a-a96b-a145cdd739a4-2
00:10:42.487 --> 00:10:44.359
amazing flying contraption.

903d1118-9087-457d-84f9-5c96954e3517-0
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.756
As she is in this little cage
being let down, she sees the

903d1118-9087-457d-84f9-5c96954e3517-1
00:10:50.756 --> 00:10:51.960
beautiful purple bird.

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-0
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.484
Coming at her with the red
crayon that started this whole

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-1
00:10:57.484 --> 00:11:02.263
event and the bird of lights on
her shoulder and she is drawing,

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-2
00:11:02.263 --> 00:11:06.674
drawing, drawing. She's drawing
something that looks like a

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-3
00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:11.306
rectangle and the bird is flying
around her and sitting beside

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-4
00:11:11.306 --> 00:11:15.644
her. So we'll see what she is
going to draw. It's a flying

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-5
00:11:15.644 --> 00:11:20.276
carpet. She has drawn a flying
carpet and now she is flying in

6195d934-7939-4f45-9821-2d2fd8db4acb-6
00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:23.070
the air over this beautiful city
and.

ec870572-69e1-400c-b45c-4a0575ac06c5-0
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.958
The bird is flying right in
front of her and the city is

ec870572-69e1-400c-b45c-4a0575ac06c5-1
00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:27.290
just.

fa36aec8-94c5-4adf-9c77-fbd8b619505c-0
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.480
Again, a very amazing place.

a0e32756-4683-49e6-bd5b-6ad6a054ce7c-0
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.420
Full of orange and purple and
blue and yellow and it looks

a0e32756-4683-49e6-bd5b-6ad6a054ce7c-1
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.943
like it might be in some I don't
even know where. Again, it's a

a0e32756-4683-49e6-bd5b-6ad6a054ce7c-2
00:11:41.943 --> 00:11:45.740
place I've never been, but it
has a lot of.

0ad6b693-7e2d-45c8-b744-781a9ec42055-0
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.550
Palm trees.

5ce01064-2122-4393-9ce3-3067a2b567c3-0
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.860
It almost looks like it's
somewhere in the Middle East.

f372daaf-2e7f-441e-886d-87cce2012fd4-0
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.017
And off she flies into the
beautiful starlit sky. And the

f372daaf-2e7f-441e-886d-87cce2012fd4-1
00:11:59.017 --> 00:12:03.136
purple bird is flying in front
of her, and she's flying over

f372daaf-2e7f-441e-886d-87cce2012fd4-2
00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:04.150
this beautiful.

b6a91b73-6b05-4090-a8f8-19493ebe1f9b-0
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.640
Place with minarets and it looks
like there are.

63e0a11c-42d6-4b3b-a92a-b28d737bb30e-0
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.296
Mountains on in the horizon and
one palm tree on the right that

63e0a11c-42d6-4b3b-a92a-b28d737bb30e-1
00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:19.090
it's a beautiful night sky with
many, many stars.

fca32b6a-4c6b-4788-bf54-9674fb51a7d7-0
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.987
Then we come to the blind carpet
of lights onto the ground and

fca32b6a-4c6b-4788-bf54-9674fb51a7d7-1
00:12:28.987 --> 00:12:34.354
the little girl takes her spray
on and she goes towards a palm

fca32b6a-4c6b-4788-bf54-9674fb51a7d7-2
00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:39.210
tree that has a little purple
door in it and the purple.

53d06ca2-051b-437e-9170-32f59505ff69-0
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.800
bird it's sitting or standing
right beside the tree.

1a302587-c742-46d2-9a2a-7ae0b7663cee-0
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.298
And she opens the door. The bird
flies into the door, and she

1a302587-c742-46d2-9a2a-7ae0b7663cee-1
00:12:50.298 --> 00:12:51.790
crawls in after.

56329455-64b8-43aa-a44b-50d42e282b1a-0
00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.029
When she's coming out of the
door, it looks like she's coming

56329455-64b8-43aa-a44b-50d42e282b1a-1
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:04.632
out of a mailbox, a US mailbox,
and the bird is flying in front

56329455-64b8-43aa-a44b-50d42e282b1a-2
00:13:04.632 --> 00:13:09.308
of her and there is a there was
a little boy going right towards

56329455-64b8-43aa-a44b-50d42e282b1a-3
00:13:09.308 --> 00:13:11.610
them and he has a purple crayon.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.640
He helps her to get up and he's
holding the purple bird.

94a7ccc6-3c8a-4d9d-bdaf-f3668791c182-0
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.453
While she draws a red circle and
he draws a purple circle and the

94a7ccc6-3c8a-4d9d-bdaf-f3668791c182-1
00:13:23.453 --> 00:13:25.860
bird is flying right above him.

b94f93aa-39be-4440-9ed5-a53e49f71fa4-0
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.395
And these circles
come together to make a bicycle.

b94f93aa-39be-4440-9ed5-a53e49f71fa4-1
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:36.259
The one part of the bicycle is
the Purple Circle, and one part

b94f93aa-39be-4440-9ed5-a53e49f71fa4-2
00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:39.693
is the Red circle, and the
Purple Bird is flying behind

b94f93aa-39be-4440-9ed5-a53e49f71fa4-3
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:43.066
them as they ride off while
they're each holding their

b94f93aa-39be-4440-9ed5-a53e49f71fa4-4
00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:45.520
purple and red crayons and off
they go. #END_journey 

5b44c04d-bb69-453d-a3a2-bfbc18cff4e0-0
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.550
That was the story.

ee60807b-9256-476e-8089-d186d8c7450e-0
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.406
And then you took around 8
minutes, so around the 10

ee60807b-9256-476e-8089-d186d8c7450e-1
00:13:53.406 --> 00:13:53.970
minute.

6fc6f6ae-0f7c-4470-9d0e-693522d2f017-0
00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.529
So this is a feedback to you?
Um, so moving on to the next

6fc6f6ae-0f7c-4470-9d0e-693522d2f017-1
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.170
story.

dc4656be-b2b0-4e6a-9ac8-0aee604b14dc-0
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.249
#START_arrival_5 OK, another
let's see. This is it looks like

dc4656be-b2b0-4e6a-9ac8-0aee604b14dc-1
00:14:13.249 --> 00:14:18.388
an amazing city full of tall
buildings all connected together

dc4656be-b2b0-4e6a-9ac8-0aee604b14dc-2
00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:23.777
with many, many windows. And it
looks like there are boats along

dc4656be-b2b0-4e6a-9ac8-0aee604b14dc-3
00:14:23.777 --> 00:14:27.010
the edge of the city and some
amazing.

27b25864-1677-458f-a521-a887dd05c818-0
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.930
creature looking.

43ea8c84-eb77-497d-94a5-3bcb5fa3f400-0
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.380
tall parts of the city are
almost like.

4f158549-096b-44e0-9cd8-e1b2213d006d-0
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.871
owl and cat faces and lots and
lots of birds flying in the air

4f158549-096b-44e0-9cd8-e1b2213d006d-1
00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:49.156
and it's all I'm looking at. All
of the amazing towers that are

4f158549-096b-44e0-9cd8-e1b2213d006d-2
00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:50.750
basically all.

e1b417cc-1497-4e76-9aad-c8da57366823-0
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.502
Animal faces and in the next
we're looking at all kinds of

e1b417cc-1497-4e76-9aad-c8da57366823-1
00:14:57.502 --> 00:15:02.629
things that are possibly going
on in this city, and in some

e1b417cc-1497-4e76-9aad-c8da57366823-2
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:03.570
cases it's.

8e47b3c6-0e13-4001-a396-4f44750d3a6c-0
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.030
People cutting up, a person,
cutting up vegetables.

24384549-b008-407b-a490-3edf834e729b-0
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.040
A person cooking something.

13cfaab5-4016-48bc-8d1a-9336eaa85df5-0
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:20.240
Some people drinking something
and they are.

7c00e2dc-7d61-486a-bd63-835e97053931-0
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.125
You see a mother handing a bowl
of possibly fruit to a little

7c00e2dc-7d61-486a-bd63-835e97053931-1
00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:32.529
boy. Two people giving each
other a hug while they are

7c00e2dc-7d61-486a-bd63-835e97053931-2
00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:36.533
holding a a basket of
vegetables, possibly some a

7c00e2dc-7d61-486a-bd63-835e97053931-3
00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:41.338
little boy walking with two
unusual looking animals walking

7c00e2dc-7d61-486a-bd63-835e97053931-4
00:15:41.338 --> 00:15:42.380
up the steps.

fe820636-f709-41cf-9abc-5d117e5ef6c7-0
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:49.152
And somebody's looking like
they're taking a rope and tying

fe820636-f709-41cf-9abc-5d117e5ef6c7-1
00:15:49.152 --> 00:15:52.620
up a creature that looks like a
cat.

7af37f9c-647e-477e-bf8b-e561a0943f5f-0
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:59.315
All sorts of things going on
within that city, right? {So in

7af37f9c-647e-477e-bf8b-e561a0943f5f-1
00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:03.806
this story, we either see two
different pages like this,

7af37f9c-647e-477e-bf8b-e561a0943f5f-2
00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:08.454
flower pictures go across and
then down. So you'll go this

7af37f9c-647e-477e-bf8b-e561a0943f5f-3
00:16:08.454 --> 00:16:13.417
way, and then the 2nd row, the
third row, the last row. OK, so

7af37f9c-647e-477e-bf8b-e561a0943f5f-4
00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:18.460
don't go. Don't be jumping all
around like I just did, OK? OK.}

89b099fc-3790-48e4-8a3b-5c7338a60770-0
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.403
{The emerging OK, so yes, the}
in the first page someone is

89b099fc-3790-48e4-8a3b-5c7338a60770-1
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:33.040
tying a rope around what looks
like a cat. And then there are

89b099fc-3790-48e4-8a3b-5c7338a60770-2
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.785
two people talking and a little
boy walking up the stairs with

89b099fc-3790-48e4-8a3b-5c7338a60770-3
00:16:39.785 --> 00:16:46.422
two creatures  a mother handing
a bowl of possibly fruit to a

89b099fc-3790-48e4-8a3b-5c7338a60770-4
00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:47.599
little boy.

053cd772-47bb-4951-a402-b62f2c633233-0
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.333
Two people giving each other a
hug. One is holding a basket of

053cd772-47bb-4951-a402-b62f2c633233-1
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:59.323
something that looks like
vegetables. It's hard for me to

053cd772-47bb-4951-a402-b62f2c633233-2
00:16:59.323 --> 00:17:03.725
tell from this angle. These are
very unusual looking things. In

053cd772-47bb-4951-a402-b62f2c633233-3
00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:08.265
this story. We've got 3 3 people
greeting each other, two men and

053cd772-47bb-4951-a402-b62f2c633233-4
00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:12.185
a woman, and we have another
woman that looks like she's

053cd772-47bb-4951-a402-b62f2c633233-5
00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:15.350
inviting us in and people are
having a drink.

f3e10691-473e-4ddb-8e24-bf20b36b3ef1-0
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:17.760
And.

ad4a5afa-fdff-4ab7-875a-e19ea42356f6-0
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.060
Someone is.

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-0
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.680
Doing something with a basket of
I don't know what these are very

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-1
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.828
unusual vegetables possibly.
It's hard for me to tell what

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-2
00:17:31.828 --> 00:17:36.046
these are. They are all unusual
looking vegetables. Or they

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-3
00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:40.335
could be something else, I don't
know. And cutting things up

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-4
00:17:40.335 --> 00:17:44.694
possibly. It looks sort of like
a cucumber with sort of spiky

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-5
00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:48.913
edges around the side and a dark
pit in the middle and then

8e7b3386-195a-4243-b91f-3b9eac6c5d3c-6
00:17:48.913 --> 00:17:52.710
something that's going within an
unusual looking pot.

c8d817ae-5f43-4653-aff2-52e905ec939e-0
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.645
With the yeah, this is. I don't
know what's going on in some of

c8d817ae-5f43-4653-aff2-52e905ec939e-1
00:17:57.645 --> 00:17:58.630
these things.

45152199-40ee-494c-80c3-a5a1cafa4800-0
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.430
It looks like.

81a0911d-b047-4b10-aff8-6e45b7646317-0
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.816
I don't know. I almost thought
it looked like sort of a bird

81a0911d-b047-4b10-aff8-6e45b7646317-1
00:18:05.816 --> 00:18:08.952
being cooked, but it's unclear
to me what is really going on

81a0911d-b047-4b10-aff8-6e45b7646317-2
00:18:08.952 --> 00:18:09.210
here.

385bc609-670f-4970-9010-ba81c82a0127-0
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.010
{OK, next page.}

efe05167-9285-41fe-891c-446f78d01c3b-0
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.316
In the next page, it looks like
they are having dinner together.

efe05167-9285-41fe-891c-446f78d01c3b-1
00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:19.940
They are.

d67a9eb4-7b8e-4bf3-b51a-1019eeed44fb-0
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:27.003
One man has a torch, and I don't
know what he's doing to that

d67a9eb4-7b8e-4bf3-b51a-1019eeed44fb-1
00:18:27.003 --> 00:18:31.976
thing that he's holding. Is he
burning it? Is he making it so

d67a9eb4-7b8e-4bf3-b51a-1019eeed44fb-2
00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:33.500
that we can eat it?

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-0
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:39.091
The little boy sitting at the
table is giving a little snap to

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-1
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:42.998
a creature that looks sort of
like a whale with a long tail

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-2
00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:47.100
that's creeping along the floor.
And there's a cat like little

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-3
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.006
creature that's also eating a
little morsel from the table.

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-4
00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:55.108
And there's also it looks like
two other people sitting at the

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-5
00:18:55.108 --> 00:18:58.884
table and eating a lot of
unusual looking vegetables that

655c1c18-ecee-4d32-a95b-8fe785c5630d-6
00:18:58.884 --> 00:18:59.210
have.

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-0
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.891
Almost like tail looking things
coming out of them and they're

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-1
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:09.270
basically just eating dinner and
we see that they're talking to

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-2
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.513
one another and laughing and
having a good time. And somebody

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-3
00:19:13.513 --> 00:19:17.756
is playing an accordion like
instrument that has little horns

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-4
00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:22.135
coming out of each side and one
woman is playing something that

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-5
00:19:22.135 --> 00:19:26.583
looks like a flute but also has
some unusual contraptions coming

5f16e88c-da07-4338-a1c7-358a4f1a1315-6
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.800
off of the side and maybe a
little light bulb.

e0aba97d-154d-45e1-aca3-0067d3494c09-0
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.500
On the top.

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-0
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.978
One little boy is playing
something that looks like a

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-1
00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:39.085
banjo and the little cat is
right beside him and doing the

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-2
00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:43.401
music. One person looks like he
is folding something. Is it a

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-3
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:47.369
napkin or is he doing origami?
It's hard for me to know.

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-4
00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:51.336
Another person is holding a
little tiny so it looks like

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-5
00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:55.582
maybe they folded in origami
cat. That's what they did. They

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-6
00:19:55.582 --> 00:19:59.968
folded an origami cat and he is
giving this to the little boy.

49f035d9-39b3-4027-9012-f2546a5563e4-7
00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:01.430
Another man let's see

71bcbece-e8cd-4a5f-a141-8d67fc280a89-0
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.921
Got a little pot of something.
You can't tell what it is

71bcbece-e8cd-4a5f-a141-8d67fc280a89-1
00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:10.428
though. They're holding this
little pot and it has something

71bcbece-e8cd-4a5f-a141-8d67fc280a89-2
00:20:10.428 --> 00:20:14.640
in the top to stir it with not
clear to me what this is.

b6854269-2609-462d-8287-df49f0818d0a-0
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.920
the pot is sitting on a shelf

8851eca3-3729-4b3d-98af-5dfa87617726-0
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.130
I see someone waking up.

dcafccdc-ff42-4e20-98da-fdf668942c55-0
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.226
And a little animal of very
funny looking little creature

dcafccdc-ff42-4e20-98da-fdf668942c55-1
00:20:32.226 --> 00:20:36.480
that looks almost like a walking
little tiny whale is coming up

dcafccdc-ff42-4e20-98da-fdf668942c55-2
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.010
to the man who woke up.

7ebec75f-3d22-430c-bbf3-71d34c5a021a-0
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.155
And he is petting that little
creature, which seems to have a

7ebec75f-3d22-430c-bbf3-71d34c5a021a-1
00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:47.774
long tail. He's getting dressed.
He is cutting up a little gourd

7ebec75f-3d22-430c-bbf3-71d34c5a021a-2
00:20:47.774 --> 00:20:51.895
like vegetable item and giving
part of that to the little

7ebec75f-3d22-430c-bbf3-71d34c5a021a-3
00:20:51.895 --> 00:20:56.087
animal to eat. He's getting
dressed and it looks like he's

7ebec75f-3d22-430c-bbf3-71d34c5a021a-4
00:20:56.087 --> 00:21:00.421
getting ready, possibly to go
out, possibly to work, and the

7ebec75f-3d22-430c-bbf3-71d34c5a021a-5
00:21:00.421 --> 00:21:02.980
little creature brings him his
hat.

9f41f583-c4f1-4fa1-b13f-230640dd8df2-0
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.939
It looks like he was going out
into the world among the crowds

9f41f583-c4f1-4fa1-b13f-230640dd8df2-1
00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:16.628
of people possibly going to work
and about their daily habits.

9f41f583-c4f1-4fa1-b13f-230640dd8df2-2
00:21:16.628 --> 00:21:21.168
There are lots of little funny
creatures walking around with

9f41f583-c4f1-4fa1-b13f-230640dd8df2-3
00:21:21.168 --> 00:21:25.336
just the people, and we're
passing a little market that

9f41f583-c4f1-4fa1-b13f-230640dd8df2-4
00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:28.759
looks like it has fish for sale,
possibly or.

6066a4e5-99b0-4422-a5a6-762ebbcd1af6-0
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.012
Is he feeding these little
creatures with his basket? It's

6066a4e5-99b0-4422-a5a6-762ebbcd1af6-1
00:21:34.012 --> 00:21:38.982
not clear to me on some of these
pictures. It looks like we're in

6066a4e5-99b0-4422-a5a6-762ebbcd1af6-2
00:21:38.982 --> 00:21:43.575
a market where people are buying
things and giving money for

6066a4e5-99b0-4422-a5a6-762ebbcd1af6-3
00:21:43.575 --> 00:21:48.093
things, and I just have never
seen some of these items that

6066a4e5-99b0-4422-a5a6-762ebbcd1af6-4
00:21:48.093 --> 00:21:52.385
are happening here. I see one
gentleman sitting beside a

6066a4e5-99b0-4422-a5a6-762ebbcd1af6-5
00:21:52.385 --> 00:21:53.440
circular item.

9e4c8bee-43d8-4b5d-9b78-c88929514300-0
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.692
I don't know what that is. Yet
another person who looks like

9e4c8bee-43d8-4b5d-9b78-c88929514300-1
00:21:59.692 --> 00:22:04.291
he's painting something,
possibly a mural on the side of

9e4c8bee-43d8-4b5d-9b78-c88929514300-2
00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:09.536
the wall and another person who
has a little heart. I can't tell

9e4c8bee-43d8-4b5d-9b78-c88929514300-3
00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:09.940
is he

1d68a880-621e-40bf-bdd6-c722073a5cfb-0
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.650
Selling something from the court
again not hearing me. What's

1d68a880-621e-40bf-bdd6-c722073a5cfb-1
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.480
going on in some of these
pictures

6ca786b0-bea7-42d1-a922-f135908b2972-0
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.095
The man that I was talking about
earlier is walking along with

6ca786b0-bea7-42d1-a922-f135908b2972-1
00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:25.967
the little creature that woke
him up this morning, and he's

6ca786b0-bea7-42d1-a922-f135908b2972-2
00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:29.130
stopping at a place that looks
like it's a chef.

419b78aa-c75a-4245-8390-2b2a921aaedf-0
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.479
Holding a bowl and he's also
stopping to see somebody is

419b78aa-c75a-4245-8390-2b2a921aaedf-1
00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:40.330
looking like he's involved in
something industrial and also

419b78aa-c75a-4245-8390-2b2a921aaedf-2
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.079
has a little creature beside
him.

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-0
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.894
And he continues onward and it
looks like he's going into a

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-1
00:22:47.894 --> 00:22:51.738
store, but the merchants that
he's talking to looks like he

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-2
00:22:51.738 --> 00:22:55.775
can't help, she can't help him
because she's holding her hands

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-3
00:22:55.775 --> 00:22:59.299
up in the air, like, like I
don't have whatever you're

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-4
00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:03.271
looking for. So he continues on
and he is talking to somebody

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-5
00:23:03.271 --> 00:23:07.436
out on the street. Again, there
are lots of people on the street

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-6
00:23:07.436 --> 00:23:11.088
doing various things, working
with brooms, holding maybe

a7b0615b-7a58-444c-9359-d94435f10f39-7
00:23:11.088 --> 00:23:14.100
possibly pieces of wood as
they're walking by.

49e583cd-a701-4937-9d30-7abb79b12e08-0
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.680
It looks like there's a big
propeller up there that I'm

49e583cd-a701-4937-9d30-7abb79b12e08-1
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.904
looking at in the sky. I'm not
sure what that's part of. And

49e583cd-a701-4937-9d30-7abb79b12e08-2
00:23:20.904 --> 00:23:22.490
again, these little creatures.

713082a5-e4fe-4b82-a9fa-6beba8751db6-0
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.215
That seemed to be
hanging out with their owners. #END_arrival_5 

713082a5-e4fe-4b82-a9fa-6beba8751db6-1
00:23:27.215 --> 00:23:27.850
all right.

4b9b752b-b1c5-4e1e-84c3-a3dc8468aa61-0
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.880
OK, that was part of the
story.

6b6590b3-c5c1-4240-91f4-c5940b752ae1-0
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.000
Moving on to the next story.

78eb6c69-f4b7-4513-9fbb-77c648fe08c7-0
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.620
OK.

531dccd8-874b-46cf-8990-ca8573841205-0
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:51.860
#START_flowerman we in a very
dark, almost like a nighttime

531dccd8-874b-46cf-8990-ca8573841205-1
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.460
scene.

25ed404e-2324-43bb-87ab-e636411d948a-0
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:58.836
We have it looks like an older
person walking over a bridge.

25ed404e-2324-43bb-87ab-e636411d948a-1
00:23:58.836 --> 00:24:04.812
There are lanterns lighting up
the bridge that looks like a car

25ed404e-2324-43bb-87ab-e636411d948a-2
00:24:04.812 --> 00:24:06.120
has gone down.

872f67fd-3eda-4715-8a3b-74b9c4e7dc86-0
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.211
It looks like the there is a car
in the in the scene that has

872f67fd-3eda-4715-8a3b-74b9c4e7dc86-1
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:11.720
gone down.

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-0
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.723
Towards the ditch that the
bridge is over, it looks like

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-1
00:24:16.723 --> 00:24:21.020
somebody has had an accident
with a car and the person is

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-2
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.243
walking with a little animal,
and I can't tell what that

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-3
00:24:25.243 --> 00:24:29.688
animal is from here. Is it
possibly a dog? But walking over

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-4
00:24:29.688 --> 00:24:34.134
the bridge with the lanterns
towards what looks like a town

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-5
00:24:34.134 --> 00:24:38.431
that has a variety of places
that you can stop at. A bait

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-6
00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:42.876
shop, a bar, somewhere to get
gas that looks like there's a

2be5c90d-38ee-40e1-bdf5-8237675149de-7
00:24:42.876 --> 00:24:43.840
Ferris wheel.

c747fa44-77e7-4c78-a831-efa99e3d1163-0
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.750
There's a tent.

37d7158d-3d9b-4baa-bed3-d7c32836f249-0
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.198
There are a number of homes with
smoke coming out of the

37d7158d-3d9b-4baa-bed3-d7c32836f249-1
00:24:49.198 --> 00:24:53.254
chimneys. There's another person
walking and there's a little

37d7158d-3d9b-4baa-bed3-d7c32836f249-2
00:24:53.254 --> 00:24:57.506
truck parked on the side of the
road. There is a series of steps

37d7158d-3d9b-4baa-bed3-d7c32836f249-3
00:24:57.506 --> 00:24:59.599
that go up in between the homes.

4112529e-077e-4a84-910a-1eff45dab167-0
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.440
It looks like there was an
anchor.

d173d3bc-5922-4a77-abed-a2a5f099e3a2-0
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.081
So it's hard for me to tell from
this drawing if there's water

d173d3bc-5922-4a77-abed-a2a5f099e3a2-1
00:25:10.081 --> 00:25:14.848
underneath the bridge, but there
is an anchor there, like a boat

d173d3bc-5922-4a77-abed-a2a5f099e3a2-2
00:25:14.848 --> 00:25:19.690
had gone by there at some point.
There's a beautiful evening sky.

7748240a-b52d-46ec-9ed1-6688e81742bd-0
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.350
In the background.

38f8faa4-1cd1-4bb0-930f-34646bb47a84-0
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.280
As the person continues to walk.

96c52a9f-530c-41d2-9f3c-3af85fd338f5-0
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.026
in between the buildings. It
looks like there's a home,

96c52a9f-530c-41d2-9f3c-3af85fd338f5-1
00:25:35.026 --> 00:25:40.839
there's a few people on the
street looking online. There is

96c52a9f-530c-41d2-9f3c-3af85fd338f5-2
00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:47.234
a cobblestone street, there is a
statue with a person on a horse.

96c52a9f-530c-41d2-9f3c-3af85fd338f5-3
00:25:47.234 --> 00:25:52.854
There is a cafe with some
windows with people looking out

96c52a9f-530c-41d2-9f3c-3af85fd338f5-4
00:25:52.854 --> 00:25:58.862
of the windows and doing things
within the windows. And let's

96c52a9f-530c-41d2-9f3c-3af85fd338f5-5
00:25:58.862 --> 00:25:59.249
see.

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-0
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.478
It's still it's still a night
sky with a number of windows

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-1
00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:07.747
into the different homes so that
you can see what people are

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-2
00:26:07.747 --> 00:26:12.155
doing and lanterns. There's a
gentleman on a motorcycle coming

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-3
00:26:12.155 --> 00:26:16.424
down the street that looks like
another little person with a

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-4
00:26:16.424 --> 00:26:20.623
beret walking along the side of
the street. One person in a

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-5
00:26:20.623 --> 00:26:25.171
vehicle with the companion going
towards our initial person that

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-6
00:26:25.171 --> 00:26:29.580
we have been following, walking
through this town. And there's

13841584-79e7-4d04-9206-f5ed8c0f15c0-7
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.210
also one.

d04f46ae-d875-4f25-ab63-01b1bb19dda0-0
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.190
Little boy.

9df8d3e2-211b-42dc-a7ce-88ac026b2182-0
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:40.515
Looking very dejected with with
a I think a cat on the veranda

9df8d3e2-211b-42dc-a7ce-88ac026b2182-1
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:41.870
of 1 house.

4fe4a0b2-b609-49fc-b42b-d55ee6829e24-0
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.666
it's an amazing town is
something that the person. It

4fe4a0b2-b609-49fc-b42b-d55ee6829e24-1
00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:56.192
looks like a man. Now I can
actually tell it's a man, and it

4fe4a0b2-b609-49fc-b42b-d55ee6829e24-2
00:26:56.192 --> 00:27:00.644
looks like he's holding some
sort of a suitcase as he walks

4fe4a0b2-b609-49fc-b42b-d55ee6829e24-3
00:27:00.644 --> 00:27:04.947
along again. We are seeing the
town and we're seeing open

4fe4a0b2-b609-49fc-b42b-d55ee6829e24-4
00:27:04.947 --> 00:27:09.399
windows with various little
vignettes of people's lives and

4fe4a0b2-b609-49fc-b42b-d55ee6829e24-5
00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:14.000
what they're doing in there,
either two people or one person.

299af582-448c-44f8-b0f1-b79204146464-0
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.298
And they there is a telescope on
the top of 1 building. It looks

299af582-448c-44f8-b0f1-b79204146464-1
00:27:19.298 --> 00:27:23.523
like there's a Coca-Cola sign.
On the side of 1 building

299af582-448c-44f8-b0f1-b79204146464-2
00:27:23.523 --> 00:27:24.710
there's a clock.

df1cd0e9-2a71-4435-a552-092af2851872-0
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.646
And there's a for sale sign on
front of 1 little, very

df1cd0e9-2a71-4435-a552-092af2851872-1
00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:34.493
dilapidated little house in this
town. A brick house right next

df1cd0e9-2a71-4435-a552-092af2851872-2
00:27:34.493 --> 00:27:39.190
to that. And again there are
various windows open. Looks like

df1cd0e9-2a71-4435-a552-092af2851872-3
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.220
possibly a mother yelling at her
child.

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-0
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.910
Of mother with a baby, a man
just sitting, kind of sad

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-1
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.025
looking, and we've got fire
hydrants. We have another

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-2
00:27:52.025 --> 00:27:56.748
dejected looking man sitting
beside what could be a fountain.

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-3
00:27:56.748 --> 00:28:01.396
Although the fountain is not
working right now it looks like

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-4
00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:05.892
a fish fountain. And another
little person sort of staring

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-5
00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:10.463
dejectedly, dejectedly toward
that fish fountain. We have a

91e8ccd8-7391-4cf7-a7e2-cf791b2c968d-6
00:28:10.463 --> 00:28:13.739
woman heading into one house and
up above.

072d470f-46d9-4610-ad13-5a23a5246b28-0
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.697
The opening to the house. The
door is a window that shows a

072d470f-46d9-4610-ad13-5a23a5246b28-1
00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.830
painter who was painting.

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-0
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.012
Can't see what he's painting,
but there is. He is holding a

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-1
00:28:27.012 --> 00:28:30.818
pallet and it looks like he's
painting some sort of picture.

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-2
00:28:30.818 --> 00:28:34.623
And we have more Windows open,
opened up into what different

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-3
00:28:34.623 --> 00:28:38.678
people are doing. It's difficult
to say what they are all doing,

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-4
00:28:38.678 --> 00:28:42.608
but you can see the people in
each house and a few people just

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-5
00:28:42.608 --> 00:28:46.600
hanging out on the side of. I've
got two guys over on the right

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-6
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.031
just sort of standing there
talking to each other, one

6a593a98-f018-41c7-99ed-94dd604d3866-7
00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:52.340
little boy just walking on the
road.

4c87a861-35ce-4561-a9fe-dddaaffb4401-0
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.745
So it's just showing a night of
this specific town and all the

4c87a861-35ce-4561-a9fe-dddaaffb4401-1
00:28:57.745 --> 00:29:01.506
things that people are doing in
there. I'd like to have a

4c87a861-35ce-4561-a9fe-dddaaffb4401-2
00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:05.657
magnifying glass so I could see
that or what they're definitely

4c87a861-35ce-4561-a9fe-dddaaffb4401-3
00:29:05.657 --> 00:29:06.630
doing in there.

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-0
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.934
Ohh We have suddenly gotten some
color into this black and white

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-1
00:29:15.934 --> 00:29:19.867
to scene and it looks like it is
turning to be morning and more

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-2
00:29:19.867 --> 00:29:23.432
things are going on in this
little town. We're seeing the

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-3
00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:27.057
same scene, but we're seeing
more activity. We're seeing a

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-4
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:30.991
lot more people on the street.
We have a person in a wheelchair

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-5
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:34.739
with it looks like he has a
broken leg, his leg is in a cast

b2d71bcc-8a46-4510-ad89-d93e129843ca-6
00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:38.550
and we have a person on a little
moped and we've got various.

347b9204-76b3-4169-9c3c-9cfddcd86750-0
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.730
People walking along the street.
We have young people, older

347b9204-76b3-4169-9c3c-9cfddcd86750-1
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.200
people.

dd835f68-69a0-403d-8b5b-07bc756b79c6-0
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.243
We have one person fixing up the
house that was for sale. Looks

dd835f68-69a0-403d-8b5b-07bc756b79c6-1
00:29:48.243 --> 00:29:52.344
like it was sold because now
there is a little lawn mower on

dd835f68-69a0-403d-8b5b-07bc756b79c6-2
00:29:52.344 --> 00:29:56.177
the grass and there's a
gentleman on a ladder working on

dd835f68-69a0-403d-8b5b-07bc756b79c6-3
00:29:56.177 --> 00:30:00.346
the shutters and it looks like
the houses has become colorful

dd835f68-69a0-403d-8b5b-07bc756b79c6-4
00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:01.960
since our last pane and.

a4caa019-4b4e-4285-a493-104881218c99-0
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.481
Very good. And again we've we've
got a window into all of these

a4caa019-4b4e-4285-a493-104881218c99-1
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:11.924
different people's lives and
what they're doing inside their

a4caa019-4b4e-4285-a493-104881218c99-2
00:30:11.924 --> 00:30:16.367
homes. the it looks like the
artist has put his palette away

a4caa019-4b4e-4285-a493-104881218c99-3
00:30:16.367 --> 00:30:16.949
for now.

aeff5824-2453-48ec-9c05-916e122db083-0
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.296
And there are just a number of
people on the streets walking

aeff5824-2453-48ec-9c05-916e122db083-1
00:30:22.296 --> 00:30:22.730
around.

c64768f3-61c2-4ae1-851c-2ba8abe7aca6-0
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:34.016
And it looks like the day
continues on the same street and

c64768f3-61c2-4ae1-851c-2ba8abe7aca6-1
00:30:34.016 --> 00:30:37.856
it's showing a lot of different
people doing all sorts of

c64768f3-61c2-4ae1-851c-2ba8abe7aca6-2
00:30:37.856 --> 00:30:42.093
different things. Again, we're
looking into the windows. We are

c64768f3-61c2-4ae1-851c-2ba8abe7aca6-3
00:30:42.093 --> 00:30:46.000
seeing the telescope on the top
of the House. But nobody's

c64768f3-61c2-4ae1-851c-2ba8abe7aca6-4
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.972
looking into the telescope at
this point. We have one woman

c64768f3-61c2-4ae1-851c-2ba8abe7aca6-5
00:30:49.972 --> 00:30:54.210
whose cat is hanging out of the
window. It is. Let's see. Yeah.

240a871c-1473-48a0-bb76-08d89fc901af-0
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.744
there's an older fellow sitting
on a chair underneath the

240a871c-1473-48a0-bb76-08d89fc901af-1
00:30:58.744 --> 00:31:03.218
Coca-Cola sign. We've got 2
girls, black and white, walking

240a871c-1473-48a0-bb76-08d89fc901af-2
00:31:03.218 --> 00:31:07.915
together, walking on the street.
We have a number of young men

240a871c-1473-48a0-bb76-08d89fc901af-3
00:31:07.915 --> 00:31:10.600
hanging out talking to one
another.

c40e4ae6-b8f3-493f-9399-332a32ca8314-0
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.490
We've got the man on the moped
still driving around. We've got

c40e4ae6-b8f3-493f-9399-332a32ca8314-1
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.916
a little girl with red hair
walking along the side of the

c40e4ae6-b8f3-493f-9399-332a32ca8314-2
00:31:18.916 --> 00:31:19.330

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-0

We've got families inside the
windows doing different various

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-1
00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:28.936
things, and one man still just
continues to sit in the window.

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-2
00:31:28.936 --> 00:31:33.302
We've got looks like the milkman
has come to deliver some milk.

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-3
00:31:33.302 --> 00:31:37.599
The artist is hanging out of his
window with the palette. It's

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-4
00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:41.487
not working right now, just
hanging out, looking out the

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-5
00:31:41.487 --> 00:31:45.716
window. Just a variety of people
doing all sorts of different

0e898a50-63c6-4193-8a37-71dbfb04659a-6
00:31:45.716 --> 00:31:50.150
things walking along the streets
and inside the windows of their

homes.

795530e6-c94a-402f-9eb0-c3e3f683a4b9-0
00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.831
And the the scene becomes more
colorful as we move along. And

795530e6-c94a-402f-9eb0-c3e3f683a4b9-1
00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:06.362
let's see the the little girl
with the red hair is hugging an

795530e6-c94a-402f-9eb0-c3e3f683a4b9-2
00:32:06.362 --> 00:32:08.949

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.983
Just so much color everywhere
has just become a very colorful

f8a3970b-9e51-422a-900e-6996fde5ed68-1
00:32:14.983 --> 00:32:17.650
scene as the day goes on we
have.

73a53321-0c3b-4592-b68d-06ac82a9aedc-0
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.336
A gentleman holding a flower we
have, let's see, what is the

73a53321-0c3b-4592-b68d-06ac82a9aedc-1
00:32:24.336 --> 00:32:28.234
artist doing now? The artist
still holding a flower and

73a53321-0c3b-4592-b68d-06ac82a9aedc-2
00:32:28.234 --> 00:32:32.410
looking out the window. The
milkman is hanging, handing the

73a53321-0c3b-4592-b68d-06ac82a9aedc-3
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.100

Truck outside.

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-0
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.378
One of the buildings, and it
looks like they are moving.

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-1
00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:47.532
Let's see. I can't tell who is
moving though. are they moving

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-2
00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:51.954
out or moving in. It's not clear
to me what's going on there. The

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-3
00:32:51.954 --> 00:32:56.376
gentleman in the window is still
there, but now there's a duck at

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-4
00:32:56.376 --> 00:33:00.798
the window. Become very colorful
everywhere. Colorful. The little

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-5
00:33:00.798 --> 00:33:04.684
house that was for sale has
become very colorful. There's

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-6
00:33:04.684 --> 00:33:08.771
now a purple roof. There are
flowers in the windows. You can

1a576ca3-067f-4628-8587-abbfa554b2a3-7
00:33:08.771 --> 00:33:09.910
see a blue chair.

1afdf039-ead1-423d-af41-013c19cf6d89-0
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.243
Through the window you can see a
table with a lamp and a lot of

1afdf039-ead1-423d-af41-013c19cf6d89-1
00:33:14.243 --> 00:33:17.840
flowers and grass, so the house
is looking very good.

ae526ce5-92f5-45d2-8567-67433d55480c-0
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.800
Multiple things happening in
this town. It's fascinating.

44228a6f-fc10-4fe8-afd1-41985662b3d8-0
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:35.502
And as we go on farther, it gets
more and more colorful. The

44228a6f-fc10-4fe8-afd1-41985662b3d8-1
00:33:35.502 --> 00:33:39.845
milkman is now dancing with the
redheaded girl. There is. The

44228a6f-fc10-4fe8-afd1-41985662b3d8-2
00:33:39.845 --> 00:33:44.187
milk truck is very colorful,
which has a little wreath on the

44228a6f-fc10-4fe8-afd1-41985662b3d8-3
00:33:44.187 --> 00:33:47.480
front of it. There's a man
playing the guitar.

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-0
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.285
Looks like it's now about 10
after four in the afternoon. We

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-1
00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:57.732
see the tree has gotten so much
more colorful with flowers all

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-2
00:33:57.732 --> 00:34:01.896
through it. The little house
that was for sale that is now

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-3
00:34:01.896 --> 00:34:06.343
completely being used since so
man is throwing a little boy in

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-4
00:34:06.343 --> 00:34:10.437
the air and cooking some
hamburgers on the grill. There's

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-5
00:34:10.437 --> 00:34:14.813
a little dog in the yard. The
grass is growing. There's a lot

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-6
00:34:14.813 --> 00:34:18.907
of flowers. There are people
playing in the street with a

ec2ff3ec-96b4-486b-a09a-b1a026de8918-7
00:34:18.907 --> 00:34:19.260
ball.

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-0
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.644
The gentleman with the cast on
his foot is still on the

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-1
00:34:24.644 --> 00:34:29.273
wheelchair and he had looks he
has somebody that's helping him

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-2
00:34:29.273 --> 00:34:33.608
and somebody talking to him
while he is going along on the

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-3
00:34:33.608 --> 00:34:37.722
street. Let's see, our artist
has decided to paint some

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-4
00:34:37.722 --> 00:34:42.057
flowers, so we see him through
the window. We have so many

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-5
00:34:42.057 --> 00:34:46.392
things going on here. It's
almost unbelievable to see this

a166f2f9-c005-4e4e-82be-01df48675e05-6
00:34:46.392 --> 00:34:50.360
little town and what is
happening here, the fountain.

7ee58a7f-856e-48c1-bdcd-6b142d1c8661-0
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:54.134
Is now going and there's a
little boy in the fountain

7ee58a7f-856e-48c1-bdcd-6b142d1c8661-1
00:34:54.134 --> 00:34:58.456
enjoying the water with a big
smile on his face and let's see.

7ee58a7f-856e-48c1-bdcd-6b142d1c8661-2
00:34:58.456 --> 00:35:02.641
Oh my goodness, it looks like
the artist has put some of his

7ee58a7f-856e-48c1-bdcd-6b142d1c8661-3
00:35:02.641 --> 00:35:06.826
pictures outside and someone is
selling them for him. And it

7ee58a7f-856e-48c1-bdcd-6b142d1c8661-4
00:35:06.826 --> 00:35:10.942
looks like there is a clown on
the street entertaining some

7ee58a7f-856e-48c1-bdcd-6b142d1c8661-5
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:11.560
children.

1ae22b7d-bccf-4d5e-b775-0bcb5746288c-0
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.270
just so much going on. It's a
lovely town.

883d4dd8-11f3-4732-8917-edd28d0224ab-0
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.832
Alright, the town continues to
get more and more colorful. Ohh

883d4dd8-11f3-4732-8917-edd28d0224ab-1
00:35:23.832 --> 00:35:27.970
my goodness, let's see what's
happening now.

3bdc5c79-8726-4461-b3ab-0c4916b9bde8-0
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.003
This tree is even more colorful
with flowers. And someone is

3bdc5c79-8726-4461-b3ab-0c4916b9bde8-1
00:35:33.003 --> 00:35:36.848
actually, it looks like it's
getting later in the day. So

3bdc5c79-8726-4461-b3ab-0c4916b9bde8-2
00:35:36.848 --> 00:35:40.760
somebody is actually up at the
telescope on the top of the

3bdc5c79-8726-4461-b3ab-0c4916b9bde8-3
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.069
building. It looks like there's
an older man and a young boy and

3bdc5c79-8726-4461-b3ab-0c4916b9bde8-4
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:48.781
a young girl, and somebody is
the little boy is looking

3bdc5c79-8726-4461-b3ab-0c4916b9bde8-5
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:50.240
through the telescope.

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-0
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.331
Again, we're looking into
people's lives, into the windows

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-1
00:35:56.331 --> 00:36:00.196
and the thing, all sorts of
gatherings. And it's hard to

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-2
00:36:00.196 --> 00:36:04.401
tell because it's the detail is
very small. It's hard to tell

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-3
00:36:04.401 --> 00:36:08.673
exactly what everybody's doing.
But seeing colorful house that

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-4
00:36:08.673 --> 00:36:12.878
the house that was for sale has
become very colorful and very

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-5
00:36:12.878 --> 00:36:17.218
pretty with a fence and flowers
all around it, a stone walkway,

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-6
00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:21.287
there's a little dog outside of
it, the purple roof flowers

d8b7deca-ac8b-4dbe-80e6-9d7949b5aa55-7
00:36:21.287 --> 00:36:21.829
outside.

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-0
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.618
And the window boxes and it's
the town has just become so

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-1
00:36:25.618 --> 00:36:29.530
colorful. It's very exciting to
see all of this. The one man

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-2
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.505
that was in the window for the
longest time looks very happy.

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-3
00:36:33.505 --> 00:36:37.608
He's now on top of the roof and
it looks like he's holding some

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-4
00:36:37.608 --> 00:36:41.776
flowers. It looks like he's got
a bath towel possibly around his

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-5
00:36:41.776 --> 00:36:45.751
waist. I don't know what he's
doing up there, but anyways, he

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-6
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:49.662
seems to be having fun and uh,
so many things going on. That

7793155d-9b44-4a01-803b-f585bf72991a-7
00:36:49.662 --> 00:36:52.420
gentleman with the cast in the
wheelchair.

2352f4cf-5af6-4fb9-83e5-1a73420fe1ee-0
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:56.087
Seems to be playing with the
ball with the children on the

2352f4cf-5af6-4fb9-83e5-1a73420fe1ee-1
00:36:56.087 --> 00:36:59.990
street. It looks like there's a
man with a cart that is selling

2352f4cf-5af6-4fb9-83e5-1a73420fe1ee-2
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.465
flowers. What's our artist
doing? I don't see the artist

2352f4cf-5af6-4fb9-83e5-1a73420fe1ee-3
00:37:03.465 --> 00:37:07.124
anymore, but I do see that he
has painted some flowers when

2352f4cf-5af6-4fb9-83e5-1a73420fe1ee-4
00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:09.990
you look through the window into
his room and.

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-0
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:15.424
Let's see, the fountain is still
going, but no one is currently

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-1
00:37:15.424 --> 00:37:19.914
in the fountain. There's a woman
walking with a child and a baby.

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-2
00:37:19.914 --> 00:37:23.927
It looks like there's an older
couple walking along on the

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-3
00:37:23.927 --> 00:37:28.009
street, and there's a man that
looks like he's entertaining

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-4
00:37:28.009 --> 00:37:32.431
people with a guitar and another
man that's dressed sort of like

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-5
00:37:32.431 --> 00:37:36.785
a clown in the street and just
so much going on one. One guy is

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-6
00:37:36.785 --> 00:37:40.867
picking up a baby and sort of
flinging them around a little

91641b36-4258-451e-9c05-5bb8b9822414-7
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:41.140
bit.

3299757d-35e0-4061-be80-96e0b1add9cc-0
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.475
Yeah, it's like, looks like one
guy's trying to ride the dog on

3299757d-35e0-4061-be80-96e0b1add9cc-1
00:37:45.475 --> 00:37:49.133
the street. So we have so many
things going on. It's a

3299757d-35e0-4061-be80-96e0b1add9cc-2
00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:52.990
wonderful little town because
it's come alive with color.

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-0
00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.903
And now it looks like it's
getting into the evening time

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-1
00:38:01.903 --> 00:38:05.986
again, because the the the light
is dimming a little bit. And

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-2
00:38:05.986 --> 00:38:10.003
again we're looking into the
windows of people and people on

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-3
00:38:10.003 --> 00:38:14.151
the street in the town. There's
one little Kitty on top of the

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-4
00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:18.234
roof hanging out by the chimney.
There's a family on a little

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-5
00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:22.317
veranda. It looks like a mother,
father and a little boy. And

47752bf4-0a8b-409e-8431-8c6bb2174fcf-6
00:38:22.317 --> 00:38:23.700
they're very happily.

63813880-377c-483a-89eb-5981504d4d8a-0
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.590
Hanging out on their veranda.

01d8172e-f332-4502-bf48-4e6eb84f18ba-0
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:31.474
We're looking at a little girl
in one window who just looks

01d8172e-f332-4502-bf48-4e6eb84f18ba-1
00:38:31.474 --> 00:38:36.050
like she has a dreamy expression
on her face while she's looking

01d8172e-f332-4502-bf48-4e6eb84f18ba-2
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.274
out the window. Looks like we
have maybe lovers looking out

01d8172e-f332-4502-bf48-4e6eb84f18ba-3
00:38:40.274 --> 00:38:44.358
the window above the cafe. And
so we've got somebody on a

01d8172e-f332-4502-bf48-4e6eb84f18ba-4
00:38:44.358 --> 00:38:48.159
motorcycle on the street, a few
people walking along.

f2928814-db55-45bd-bbde-0759fc8b0796-0
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.090
It's quite quietening down as
the light dims.

fc56e580-d248-473d-b4fe-878e1dd400f5-0
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.580
Getting dark again and.

4a7c83e6-682d-402b-a77b-d7dac109b167-0
00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.480
The color is going out of the
picture as it gets darker.

2345f68a-2b0f-4819-9b15-a6921bf38373-0
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:14.540
And we see the gentleman that we
followed from the beginning.

a11b51fd-469c-4376-9f1f-22e19f378753-0
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:21.480
He's holding something in his
hand. I'm not sure what it is.

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-0
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.519
It looks like it has the #10 on
it, and there's a dog right next

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-1
00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:32.780
to him on the street. He had
some people that are in the

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-2
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.340
window and they're looking like
they're surprised as they're

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-3
00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.049
looking out the window at him.
We have some other windows that

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-4
00:39:42.049 --> 00:39:46.235
are open that we are looking
into people's lives, doing

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-5
00:39:46.235 --> 00:39:50.646
various things, and we have one
gentleman sitting near the

5da59bf0-d5f5-4306-a254-7ded29e3e568-6
00:39:50.646 --> 00:39:52.590
fountain with a little dog

45b427dd-b1b3-4171-959c-099b24e4036e-0
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.374
That's like a bulldog. They
don't know what he's holding.

45b427dd-b1b3-4171-959c-099b24e4036e-1
00:39:56.374 --> 00:39:59.850
He's holding something. Yeah, I
don't know what it is.

d993d152-49d8-44f3-a9cf-7817e2a7cdb7-0
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.700
But as we see this.

f5a565b7-542c-4720-a34a-41168083f697-0
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.397
Picture we see
people holding flowers. One

f5a565b7-542c-4720-a34a-41168083f697-1
00:40:14.397 --> 00:40:19.076
person looks very surprised and
very delighted with her flower

f5a565b7-542c-4720-a34a-41168083f697-2
00:40:19.076 --> 00:40:23.829
and the other person is in the
window. It's an older fellow and

f5a565b7-542c-4720-a34a-41168083f697-3
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:28.656
he looks very happy to have his
flower too. And we see the older

f5a565b7-542c-4720-a34a-41168083f697-4
00:40:28.656 --> 00:40:33.409
fellow that we were watching all
through us walking up into the

f5a565b7-542c-4720-a34a-41168083f697-5
00:40:33.409 --> 00:40:36.380
right. So I don't really know
how that.

7fcdd488-8e67-4aea-a84c-96a3292c6674-0
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.040
I don't know how that connected
that thing that was holding. I

7fcdd488-8e67-4aea-a84c-96a3292c6674-1
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.030
don't understand what that was
all about. #END_flowerman 

cd52bc02-5551-4f31-a2cb-da4213881ad0-0
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:49.898
No, not even. OK, so that was
this story. Now let's take a

cd52bc02-5551-4f31-a2cb-da4213881ad0-1
00:40:49.898 --> 00:40:50.610
break.

7fd2827f-21a1-45a4-95a8-ac02ca74d67a-0
00:40:54.580 --> 00:41:00.390
We just finished up this story,
so moving on to the next one.

08848468-58e2-40b5-88c8-e41236869020-0
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:08.313
Again, the orientation of the
smaller pictures are across and

08848468-58e2-40b5-88c8-e41236869020-1
00:41:08.313 --> 00:41:09.760
then down across.

c701fcf2-0113-4daf-bd87-0d0c633808ab-0
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.780
#START_arrival_1 We open up with
a picture of family as a

c701fcf2-0113-4daf-bd87-0d0c633808ab-1
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.527
photograph that's sitting on a
shelf somewhere is taking that

c701fcf2-0113-4daf-bd87-0d0c633808ab-2
00:41:20.527 --> 00:41:23.590
photo off the shelf and wrapping
it up.

aa83049f-f2ef-4cc4-b86e-d2a2fa09df7f-0
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.730
and tying it up

12192001-bca8-46c7-a28b-2974dcd23846-0
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.150
And it looks like.

279788b7-0872-46eb-9b5e-17ac8999d26b-0
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.366
They are putting it somewhere
that I can't tell where, let's

279788b7-0872-46eb-9b5e-17ac8999d26b-1
00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:33.520
see

2a384775-ba3f-45cb-9bd3-a34b24766396-0
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:38.692
Putting it in a drawer, it looks
like the wrapping it up and

2a384775-ba3f-45cb-9bd3-a34b24766396-1
00:41:38.692 --> 00:41:42.030
putting it in a drawer and
closing it into the drawer.

515c1cce-5f22-446e-b44f-4b37e6942b8f-0
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.870
{OK, next one.}

1f05e47c-5fde-46af-b906-4cb461c56cee-0
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:58.880
An origami bird on a shelf to
see a clock.

69f0fde2-5ba9-43a5-93b6-a56446db23be-0
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.430
And.

7e58395b-52e3-4cb6-abc5-b96d956f8ee0-0
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.940
to turn on the clock, we see a
hat

900b1f0d-8dc9-46b8-a468-9622dc400f73-0
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.370
And a dish cloth hanging off the
hooks

287d20e4-cfc7-4345-8eb3-3c655983fdb6-0
00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:16.084
we see a pot and a spoon, the
pot Lid is slightly Askew. We

287d20e4-cfc7-4345-8eb3-3c655983fdb6-1
00:42:16.084 --> 00:42:22.036
see a picture that has been made
what looks like a young person,

287d20e4-cfc7-4345-8eb3-3c655983fdb6-2
00:42:22.036 --> 00:42:27.805
and it's a picture of a family,
a father, a mother and a child

287d20e4-cfc7-4345-8eb3-3c655983fdb6-3
00:42:27.805 --> 00:42:33.757
and a bird and puppies, son and
a flower and looks like possibly

287d20e4-cfc7-4345-8eb3-3c655983fdb6-4
00:42:33.757 --> 00:42:37.420
some birds flying in the air and
maybe.

0c94b756-d7ce-475c-a1c9-5f0d439049a7-0
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:45.433
Which looks like it was made
with plastic crayon or pencil.

0c94b756-d7ce-475c-a1c9-5f0d439049a7-1
00:42:45.433 --> 00:42:51.234
We see the teapot and it looks
like it's steaming, like it has

0c94b756-d7ce-475c-a1c9-5f0d439049a7-2
00:42:51.234 --> 00:42:56.850
some hot tea in it. You see a
cup with tea in it and we see.

24b8a66e-d25c-4ca7-81e9-07bc449ac936-0
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.508
possibly a ticket, maybe a a
ticket to go on a boat. We see a

24b8a66e-d25c-4ca7-81e9-07bc449ac936-1
00:43:05.508 --> 00:43:10.683
trunk with something clothing
folded into the trunk, and we

24b8a66e-d25c-4ca7-81e9-07bc449ac936-2
00:43:10.683 --> 00:43:15.945
see a family. It looks like you
see a mother, a father and a

24b8a66e-d25c-4ca7-81e9-07bc449ac936-3
00:43:15.945 --> 00:43:21.121
little girl. And then we see a
Trunk and we see a man and a

24b8a66e-d25c-4ca7-81e9-07bc449ac936-4
00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:25.952
woman. They have the Trunk
sitting on the kitchen table

24b8a66e-d25c-4ca7-81e9-07bc449ac936-5
00:43:25.952 --> 00:43:28.540
with a teapot and two cups of.

3573084a-1b7c-4f1a-ba15-35382f4d206d-0
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:33.220
Tea and the teapot steaming like
the tea is hot

7ca46540-b9f8-417a-938f-10ebd338d783-0
00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.500
And it looks like the mother and
the father have their hands.

2a3fceb2-eb45-405b-9e87-ca64ddce583c-0
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.263
Holding together on top of the
trunk, two of their hands are

2a3fceb2-eb45-405b-9e87-ca64ddce583c-1
00:43:44.263 --> 00:43:46.290
holding together on top of the
trunk.

c6a5f976-5a73-4d51-97fd-d2298576e834-0
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.754
Now we see a little girl
sleeping and she is slowly

c6a5f976-5a73-4d51-97fd-d2298576e834-1
00:43:55.754 --> 00:44:01.298
waking up and yawning, coming to
the breakfast table and getting

c6a5f976-5a73-4d51-97fd-d2298576e834-2
00:44:01.298 --> 00:44:06.244
something to eat out of a bowl
with a spoon, looking at a

c6a5f976-5a73-4d51-97fd-d2298576e834-3
00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:11.447
suitcase. And there is a father
putting his hat on, a mother

c6a5f976-5a73-4d51-97fd-d2298576e834-4
00:44:11.447 --> 00:44:16.820
putting a scarf on her head. The
child is getting a coat and a

c6a5f976-5a73-4d51-97fd-d2298576e834-5
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.270
hat on and boots.

81f7a77e-5d1d-48fe-80cf-ce1fd33c0e2d-0
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:24.280
And it looks like they are
coming out of the house with the

81f7a77e-5d1d-48fe-80cf-ce1fd33c0e2d-1
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.630
suitcase. Walking down the
street, there is a shadow on the

81f7a77e-5d1d-48fe-80cf-ce1fd33c0e2d-2
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.000
wall of the house that looks
like a dragon tail.

a343cd02-234b-4f57-87e6-67097516aecb-0
00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:37.420


f81c842b-bdcb-4a55-8b27-6433f9d4f3f2-0
00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:44.781
Girl is holding hands with her
mom and dad and she is just

f81c842b-bdcb-4a55-8b27-6433f9d4f3f2-1
00:44:44.781 --> 00:44:50.710
walking along with them as they
go towards the train station.

bd992642-9540-437e-baf8-def17658be7d-0
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.270
and her father

575872b1-480a-448a-978e-f3916e3882c7-0
00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.151
Takes off his hat and there's an
origami bird inside his hat. He

575872b1-480a-448a-978e-f3916e3882c7-1
00:44:59.151 --> 00:45:01.000
gives it to the little girl.

8ecbcc8d-33c1-40d9-9c1f-78b27036228f-0
00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:08.502
They give each other a hug. The
mother is crying. She gives the

8ecbcc8d-33c1-40d9-9c1f-78b27036228f-1
00:45:08.502 --> 00:45:14.371
father a hug and it looks like
the father is going away on the

8ecbcc8d-33c1-40d9-9c1f-78b27036228f-2
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:14.930
train.

1556e165-3fa8-415b-8679-54b6033a4dde-0
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.950
Then goes on.

8b09b5e9-7b16-49ae-a27c-4546e588c9c6-0
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.140


90635025-217b-4495-9125-6cc6aabd41aa-0
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:25.980
The photograph of the family.

38e51be2-1e22-4f15-95d9-62d851648b75-0
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:35.878
Looks like it's sitting on the
trunk where the father is as

38e51be2-1e22-4f15-95d9-62d851648b75-1
00:45:35.878 --> 00:45:38.720
he's eating something out of a
bowl.

cdfb04d1-efc2-4c45-a965-06b864b76c12-0
00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.317
Looks like he's
on a ship because we're looking

cdfb04d1-efc2-4c45-a965-06b864b76c12-1
00:45:45.317 --> 00:45:49.429
through a porthole and we're
seeing him through that porthole

cdfb04d1-efc2-4c45-a965-06b864b76c12-2
00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:53.805
as he is eating out of the bowl.
And we're looking at the picture

cdfb04d1-efc2-4c45-a965-06b864b76c12-3
00:45:53.805 --> 00:45:57.917
of the family that he has sat
down on his trunk in his little

cdfb04d1-efc2-4c45-a965-06b864b76c12-4
00:45:57.917 --> 00:46:00.570
cabin in the ship and we see
this ship.

1608036b-58d4-4fb9-9842-e4f58b580553-0
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.790
Going away. #END_arrival_1

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-0
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.258
All right. OK, so up to now
you've only seen graphic novels,

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-1
00:46:08.258 --> 00:46:12.467
and the second type of pictures
that you will see will be

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-2
00:46:12.467 --> 00:46:16.966
complex scenes. And as the name
suggests, it's pretty crowded

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-3
00:46:16.966 --> 00:46:21.465
and busy. Imagine that you're
describing the scene to someone

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-4
00:46:21.465 --> 00:46:25.746
who cannot see the picture.
Describe what is happening and

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-5
00:46:25.746 --> 00:46:30.027
what you'll see as thoroughly as
possible, and try to take

3db0d297-5773-4d51-90a6-dba7d38224a4-6
00:46:30.027 --> 00:46:32.350
between three and five minutes.

Ready. Go.

049d1c60-d2ef-4122-9bd4-74b5b0f88196-1
00:46:45.997 --> 00:46:50.552
Waldo books if you know what
those are. There are many many

049d1c60-d2ef-4122-9bd4-74b5b0f88196-2
00:46:50.552 --> 00:46:54.956
many people in this scene. It
looks like it is a scene of

049d1c60-d2ef-4122-9bd4-74b5b0f88196-3
00:46:54.956 --> 00:46:57.690
people camping in little tents
and.

497ffa5c-b30c-4856-9775-225fc964448b-0
00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.120
Little mobile homes.

23645cc2-62ab-4728-a995-0388839fbfbe-0
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:07.589
They are camping near a brook of
water where there is fish and

23645cc2-62ab-4728-a995-0388839fbfbe-1
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:13.194
there is also an area where they
can bicycle and walk and run and

23645cc2-62ab-4728-a995-0388839fbfbe-2
00:47:13.194 --> 00:47:18.459
there is a lot of green grass
for them to put their tents on.

23645cc2-62ab-4728-a995-0388839fbfbe-3
00:47:18.459 --> 00:47:23.894
There are all different types of
tents of all colors, green and

23645cc2-62ab-4728-a995-0388839fbfbe-4
00:47:23.894 --> 00:47:28.140
pink and blue and tan and multi
colored flowered.

2177a204-1d0e-4bd5-b412-b4d1e5f13c47-0
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.620
There are in one section of this
area, there are some.

ac23f43b-4c4b-49af-b2f8-27cc6615cbe7-0
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:40.911
cows or bulls? Yes, and somebody
is pretending to be a matador

ac23f43b-4c4b-49af-b2f8-27cc6615cbe7-1
00:47:40.911 --> 00:47:43.150
with a little red claw.

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-0
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.022
We have people doing all sorts
of things. We've got hikers.

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-1
00:47:49.022 --> 00:47:52.684
We've got many, many hikers that
are tired, that looks like

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-2
00:47:52.684 --> 00:47:56.102
they've been hugging through
very long time. People are

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-3
00:47:56.102 --> 00:48:00.131
making faces at the Bulls, which
is not a very smart thing to do.

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-4
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:03.976
There are ducks on the water.
There are people on little boats

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-5
00:48:03.976 --> 00:48:07.883
on the water. There are people
fishing. It looks like there are

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-6
00:48:07.883 --> 00:48:11.667
mermaids in the water. They look
like mermaids. I don't know.

7cd4fcb8-8573-4542-a730-340d92e940ac-7
00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:14.169
There are people walking and
hiking and.

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-0
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.738
It's like there are little
bunnies and birds. There are

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-1
00:48:18.738 --> 00:48:23.473
just so many people all over the
place doing all sorts of things,

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-2
00:48:23.473 --> 00:48:28.065
riding bikes. Let's see, there's
a little bridge over the brook

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-3
00:48:28.065 --> 00:48:32.370
that you can walk on and there
are. There's a lot of green.

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-4
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:36.675
There are. It's like a green
hedge all around a grassy area

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-5
00:48:36.675 --> 00:48:41.124
where people could park their
mobile homes or put their tents

a41be437-bf00-4de7-924e-8b62fc4e0894-6
00:48:41.124 --> 00:48:44.640
down and in the far away the
hills go on and on.

78d560d7-da6a-4456-b26f-8cc1d261dd84-0
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:51.255
And you can see trees, trees,
trees and fields and the far

78d560d7-da6a-4456-b26f-8cc1d261dd84-1
00:48:51.255 --> 00:48:53.250
distance and rocky.

25b30311-fa4b-4310-9814-b556431dcb33-0
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.880
Fences and.

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-0
00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.593
Just let's see,
the people in the mobile homes

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-1
00:49:01.593 --> 00:49:05.506
are doing all sorts of things.
There are dogs there, they're

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-2
00:49:05.506 --> 00:49:09.483
walking along, they're grilling
food. Looks like there's some

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-3
00:49:09.483 --> 00:49:13.461
smoke coming out of 1 camper.
It's like it's on fire. I don't

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-4
00:49:13.461 --> 00:49:17.695
know what's going on over there.
Very strange. And there are some

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-5
00:49:17.695 --> 00:49:21.351
Boy Scouts on one side and
they're practicing their fire

39768b8f-aca7-451d-9fd2-f5523d0aa206-6
00:49:21.351 --> 00:49:22.250
making skills.  

d60734e1-cfe2-42dd-82e6-3cf6e63e1c47-0
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.870
I think I have said everything
I can say about this picture. #END_campsite

fc8497bf-e3c8-432c-98c8-1288e569102e-0
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:35.194
OK, that was about 3 minutes.
So the next picture, it's ohh,

fc8497bf-e3c8-432c-98c8-1288e569102e-1
00:49:35.194 --> 00:49:40.218
it's a graphic novel. So again,
as you go through this story,

fc8497bf-e3c8-432c-98c8-1288e569102e-2
00:49:40.218 --> 00:49:45.324
pretty please describe what you
see and what is happening. OK.

fc8497bf-e3c8-432c-98c8-1288e569102e-3
00:49:45.324 --> 00:49:50.105
This is the one we've already
done though. Are we doing it

fc8497bf-e3c8-432c-98c8-1288e569102e-4
00:49:50.105 --> 00:49:54.886
again so that that's actually a
series of stories. This is

fc8497bf-e3c8-432c-98c8-1288e569102e-5
00:49:54.886 --> 00:49:59.019
another story, but in the same
series. OK, I see.

74054f7e-e076-442a-beb9-d1bc88c4399d-0
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:04.216
#START_return So in this story,
we're seeing the inside of a

74054f7e-e076-442a-beb9-d1bc88c4399d-1
00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:04.660
house.

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-0
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:11.519
We are seeing people doing
various things within the House.

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-1
00:50:11.519 --> 00:50:16.043
It looks like we have a father
and he is upstairs working at a

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-2
00:50:16.043 --> 00:50:20.640
drafting table and I see a kite
flying in his room and the rest

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-3
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.949
of the rooms are empty. Except
for when I say empty, I mean

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-4
00:50:24.949 --> 00:50:29.187
without people. Except for
there's a cat laying on the bed

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-5
00:50:29.187 --> 00:50:33.496
in one room, the entranceway.
There is. There are no people

1538d905-c622-4198-8f92-5a9b5ef7f689-6
00:50:33.496 --> 00:50:36.800
there, but there's a door and
there's a lamp.

9c91aa14-822d-4993-b1d3-e54363efb627-0
00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.716
And there is a pot with the
plant in it and some photos on

9c91aa14-822d-4993-b1d3-e54363efb627-1
00:50:41.716 --> 00:50:46.552
the wall. The kitchen has
cabinets and a stove, but no one

9c91aa14-822d-4993-b1d3-e54363efb627-2
00:50:46.552 --> 00:50:48.110
is there right now.

9b57793d-e275-4bea-af0b-8247fab818e2-0
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:55.459
The only other person in the
house is a young girl in her

9b57793d-e275-4bea-af0b-8247fab818e2-1
00:50:55.459 --> 00:51:00.500
bedroom and she is using a red
crayon to draw.

3b75c7fc-a4d2-413b-bbad-144daf603965-0
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:07.745
A door on the wall of her
bedroom in her bedroom also is a

3b75c7fc-a4d2-413b-bbad-144daf603965-1
00:51:07.745 --> 00:51:08.150
red.

ac14f471-2d60-44a8-972b-d9708baa9227-0
00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:14.040
A miniature hot air balloon
hanging from her ceiling and a

ac14f471-2d60-44a8-972b-d9708baa9227-1
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.570
miniature purple bird.

1f96db7e-cf27-41f1-9a3e-17c6dad7a174-0
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:21.050
Yeah, we are also seeing the
bathroom with no one in it with

1f96db7e-cf27-41f1-9a3e-17c6dad7a174-1
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:25.497
the sink. We're also seeing a
room that has a television in

1f96db7e-cf27-41f1-9a3e-17c6dad7a174-2
00:51:25.497 --> 00:51:25.720
it.

a3d6ea6b-5981-4227-b4c6-dcf7c4902a42-0
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.716
And we're seeing a stairway,
we're seeing a basement. And

a3d6ea6b-5981-4227-b4c6-dcf7c4902a42-1
00:51:31.716 --> 00:51:37.653
then outside the house we do see
a red light and another building

a3d6ea6b-5981-4227-b4c6-dcf7c4902a42-2
00:51:37.653 --> 00:51:43.230
and we see it looks like a city
in the background and a tree.

5ca4e97e-bf7a-407f-9a74-a012f9df68ca-0
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:56.648
We see the father at the
drafting table, turn around and

5ca4e97e-bf7a-407f-9a74-a012f9df68ca-1
00:51:56.648 --> 00:52:02.347
look at the kite. He gets off
his chair and picks up the kite

5ca4e97e-bf7a-407f-9a74-a012f9df68ca-2
00:52:02.347 --> 00:52:03.450
in the next.

a1428ee4-6594-4c2a-a429-b9c7b779a763-0
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:05.710
Let's scene

cd307b16-9a72-4afb-9d59-72dd922c7f2a-0
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:11.424
But we see the kite on the floor
and he's no longer in the scene.

cd307b16-9a72-4afb-9d59-72dd922c7f2a-1
00:52:11.424 --> 00:52:15.060
Then we see him in his
daughter's room looking through.

ec8c726d-b3da-48ee-b11d-c86d9bcdf86e-0
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.806
What has become a door that she
had drawn on her wall of her

ec8c726d-b3da-48ee-b11d-c86d9bcdf86e-1
00:52:20.806 --> 00:52:25.157
bedroom has become an actual
door, and her father is

ec8c726d-b3da-48ee-b11d-c86d9bcdf86e-2
00:52:25.157 --> 00:52:28.030
standing, looking out of the
door.

ce60efbd-2500-4fc1-bad5-1bd9c936beb3-0
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.960
Outside.

4f405c5d-dc4a-44e3-ae00-22cf225dba0f-0
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:38.728
He comes out of the door and
sees a beautiful scene of a

4f405c5d-dc4a-44e3-ae00-22cf225dba0f-1
00:52:38.728 --> 00:52:42.770
magical forest with lights
strung throughout.

c312906f-e3e6-40fc-8b0a-015adb1f220a-0
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:49.933
the trees and beautiful lanterns
lit up and hanging from the

c312906f-e3e6-40fc-8b0a-015adb1f220a-1
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:55.655
trees. Multiple types of
lanterns, different shapes and

c312906f-e3e6-40fc-8b0a-015adb1f220a-2
00:52:55.655 --> 00:53:01.684
their fireflies flying through
the air also. And there's a

c312906f-e3e6-40fc-8b0a-015adb1f220a-3
00:53:01.684 --> 00:53:05.669
brook coming throughout the
trees and.

c61ce1eb-b007-428d-a11b-0c5d8920699c-0
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:13.230
 red ball sitting on the edge of

c7f57a37-db2b-4316-9bbd-0b84313761ec-0
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:17.120
the Area that he's looking at.

b5480640-3051-4b78-814f-a5b17baf0631-0
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.020
{Yes.}

c405241c-4351-4009-807c-ff506245d879-0
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:28.318
He goes over to where the ball
is and he picks it up and

c405241c-4351-4009-807c-ff506245d879-1
00:53:28.318 --> 00:53:29.570
looking over.

fd6a130e-58e6-4413-a58c-3f9b96b395b6-0
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.710
To the right on the coming
around.

0d6a88f9-508c-4e96-93e1-4a59f31afe9b-0
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.435
There is actually a It looks
like a boat that's in the shape

0d6a88f9-508c-4e96-93e1-4a59f31afe9b-1
00:53:39.435 --> 00:53:39.750
of a.

c2c5915b-4e84-4daf-b0e2-9431e7ffd784-0
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.260
Somewhat.

ad347a0f-647c-4634-bf54-2ded5df5a0bc-0
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:48.304
A dragon slash bird. It's an
unusual shape with horns, a very

ad347a0f-647c-4634-bf54-2ded5df5a0bc-1
00:53:48.304 --> 00:53:54.507
narrow face, and very elegantly
comes down almost like a swan.

ad347a0f-647c-4634-bf54-2ded5df5a0bc-2
00:53:54.507 --> 00:53:56.280
And then it has a.

4b2e09dc-ecf4-4085-a82f-b3ad2d31dfba-0
00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.170
fan shaped tail in the back of
this.

893b66e8-22be-4ac6-a2f1-b5812df6c7be-0
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:03.580
boat like

0798849b-f691-43d9-81b8-9d353ce409be-0
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:10.170
Item and this boat sails past
him.

b3962a57-883b-4f3d-ad8c-6bed9e36aaa5-0
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:16.277
As he watches and he jumps from
the dock onto the boat and off

b3962a57-883b-4f3d-ad8c-6bed9e36aaa5-1
00:54:16.277 --> 00:54:16.950
he goes.

bd663af0-3bb3-406f-b031-150acbc08d4a-0
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:27.303
The boat takes him to a castle
that has filled with all kinds

bd663af0-3bb3-406f-b031-150acbc08d4a-1
00:54:27.303 --> 00:54:33.538
of towers and domes and this
multi multiple rooms, and as

bd663af0-3bb3-406f-b031-150acbc08d4a-2
00:54:33.538 --> 00:54:36.870
he's sliding up to this castle.

f4fb4397-5411-4e69-b612-e73dbc0acc49-0
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:43.631
He sees over to the right his
daughter on a tiny little red

f4fb4397-5411-4e69-b612-e73dbc0acc49-1
00:54:43.631 --> 00:54:48.778
boat, and she's going on onto
she's going on a bridge off on

f4fb4397-5411-4e69-b612-e73dbc0acc49-2
00:54:48.778 --> 00:54:53.840
one section of the castle to
another section of the castle.

f52726d0-cef0-469f-996a-15d8b6453f52-0
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:02.320
The father jumps off the boat.

52294f42-de2b-44a7-b8fe-c2d874c28885-0
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:09.630
on to the dock and he sees a
number of things. He sees it

52294f42-de2b-44a7-b8fe-c2d874c28885-1
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:15.979
looks like possibly a king and
two princes there because they

52294f42-de2b-44a7-b8fe-c2d874c28885-2
00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:21.920
have crowns on their heads.
There is a purple bird lying.

311cb457-554c-4d2f-bf3b-d5e031f147fb-0
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.980
And there he's going towards the
set of steps.

9642aee7-7b49-4f51-b301-cdffd41820f3-0
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.165
He's running towards a set of
steps. On the right hand side

9642aee7-7b49-4f51-b301-cdffd41820f3-1
00:55:32.165 --> 00:55:36.346
there are some soldiers. It
looks like they are soldiers,

9642aee7-7b49-4f51-b301-cdffd41820f3-2
00:55:36.346 --> 00:55:40.455
but they have trumpets and in
next area the king and the

9642aee7-7b49-4f51-b301-cdffd41820f3-3
00:55:40.455 --> 00:55:40.960
Prince.

2e09c0cd-f49a-406b-968e-09d0fc427636-0
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.550
Are there with a throne

c6babc20-3753-4e6c-b005-3e22208d0156-0
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:51.030
And the father looks like he's
coming to them to question them.

1a1e42eb-27a5-4896-a5fc-315252baeebd-0
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:04.137
Now the purple bird is flying
above them. There is somebody

1a1e42eb-27a5-4896-a5fc-315252baeebd-1
00:56:04.137 --> 00:56:08.352
coming off of somebody else
coming off of the boat, and he

1a1e42eb-27a5-4896-a5fc-315252baeebd-2
00:56:08.352 --> 00:56:12.639
is coming towards the king, the
two princes and the father.

701d5139-2604-4a20-a1ce-bce7891dfd2d-0
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:22.150
The king is holding some sort of
light.

e3620533-a5ec-487b-82be-ede4932dad3f-0
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.140
and

b517058d-cb75-42d3-b0b0-773912766ddc-0
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:29.253
It looks like the people coming
off the boat are not, are

b517058d-cb75-42d3-b0b0-773912766ddc-1
00:56:29.253 --> 00:56:33.602
enemies. They don't look like
they're up to anything good that

b517058d-cb75-42d3-b0b0-773912766ddc-2
00:56:33.602 --> 00:56:38.090
looks like they have Spears and
they are going to try to attack.

62a51c7e-4486-4913-b2f3-d6d84e7b759b-0
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:43.769
But the king is holding
something high in the air and it

62a51c7e-4486-4913-b2f3-d6d84e7b759b-1
00:56:43.769 --> 00:56:46.950
looks like it was some sort of a
lit object.

3703f406-3da2-462b-9210-3e49d0097a7b-0
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:50.780


529947de-4b2b-414d-b105-4394fb21638f-0
00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:59.722
Like a laser, some sort of like
a light Saber or something like

529947de-4b2b-414d-b105-4394fb21638f-1
00:56:59.722 --> 00:57:05.137
that. And it seems to seep these
enemies at Bay. It's like a

529947de-4b2b-414d-b105-4394fb21638f-2
00:57:05.137 --> 00:57:07.890
sword that has light on it and.

0a4a6ada-62c5-4247-99f3-1d9acb87e84a-0
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:19.010
The enemy seemed to somehow grab
the king and hold on to him.

db2cbf02-c260-413b-8ae9-fc65b6c61f3f-0
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:27.283
And one of them is holding some
sort of a box that has a handle

db2cbf02-c260-413b-8ae9-fc65b6c61f3f-1
00:57:27.283 --> 00:57:32.776
on it that spins, and he is
running away with this box while

db2cbf02-c260-413b-8ae9-fc65b6c61f3f-2
00:57:32.776 --> 00:57:38.358
the king is holding up his arm
like he's not happy about this

db2cbf02-c260-413b-8ae9-fc65b6c61f3f-3
00:57:38.358 --> 00:57:40.250
box being taken away.

cd2d12f7-4ff4-4935-8fa1-8ca72da89891-0
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:48.780
Meanwhile.

7cf8b50d-0e63-46b4-954b-56d41002dd07-0
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:55.240
The one of the young Princes has
a purple crayon and he.

50caddc4-75ac-4603-8e5a-c5945683473f-0
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:03.503
A picture of a flying dragon and
the father and the two princes

50caddc4-75ac-4603-8e5a-c5945683473f-1
00:58:03.503 --> 00:58:08.631
jump on the Purple Flying Dragon
and fly away in front of the

50caddc4-75ac-4603-8e5a-c5945683473f-2
00:58:08.631 --> 00:58:13.180
moon. You see the full moon in
the background and the.

9cdae56d-6bf3-49a0-8399-776e820a8190-0
00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.834
The enemy that's holding this
box, this mysterious box is sort

9cdae56d-6bf3-49a0-8399-776e820a8190-1
00:58:18.834 --> 00:58:22.898
of reaching out to them like
you'd like to grab them, but

9cdae56d-6bf3-49a0-8399-776e820a8190-2
00:58:22.898 --> 00:58:24.370
they are flying away.

5b550f7f-e0e9-43f3-b545-c637ea14a9f9-0
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:26.620
And the purple

49a9dbf9-1d15-42b4-a1b8-98404c58586e-0
00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:28.620
dragon

4ebeae91-fb3a-44f1-8bbe-11fad4d4a497-0
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:38.256
Everyone is looking at them as
they fly away. The young Prince

4ebeae91-fb3a-44f1-8bbe-11fad4d4a497-1
00:58:38.256 --> 00:58:42.000
loses his purple crayon. It goes
flying away.

958f8c4f-3b20-4391-b83e-ae7d946dfa24-0
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.709
And the other Prince has a red
crayon so we will keep that in

958f8c4f-3b20-4391-b83e-ae7d946dfa24-1
00:58:46.709 --> 00:58:47.600
mind for later.

a25a7ba1-5ee3-4fdf-bc9c-99c5af455afb-0
00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.660
{That's all I got to say, OK.}

c0985b9b-3662-44e6-a8f3-aa81bf323864-0
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.610
now

ac0c5c6f-f165-4841-80c1-b3b11c1e5942-0
00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:06.080
There there's some sort well the
boat that we saw earlier.

201f91a6-3b1b-4671-a658-47811ff1f046-0
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.600
Now has the king on it.

9a406d8d-ff61-4d9b-96ae-1c7b51a0a0b4-0
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.100
And the.

83964be2-b4dd-4981-b1ae-2bfa0429a558-0
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:16.290
Enemy that has the box as he's.

5b1fc5cd-2077-4539-b904-fb3f634af7f3-0
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.490
Turning the handle on the box it
somehow.

fde678f4-057f-4bfc-ad93-ed4684f2cfea-0
00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.173
Just like it's tearing the
purple Dragon apart somehow and

fde678f4-057f-4bfc-ad93-ed4684f2cfea-1
00:59:26.173 --> 00:59:31.155
the father falls off. The Purple
Dragon and the Prince with the

fde678f4-057f-4bfc-ad93-ed4684f2cfea-2
00:59:31.155 --> 00:59:35.904
red Crayon grabs the purple bird
and they are sort of flying

fde678f4-057f-4bfc-ad93-ed4684f2cfea-3
00:59:35.904 --> 00:59:40.887
through the air. The King grabs
onto the other Prince and holds

fde678f4-057f-4bfc-ad93-ed4684f2cfea-4
00:59:40.887 --> 00:59:45.870
him up into the ship so that he
doesn't go flying into the air.

37ae73ad-8f37-41ea-a574-587667c43438-0
00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:58.959
They fall the father and the one
Prince fall into the water and

37ae73ad-8f37-41ea-a574-587667c43438-1
00:59:58.959 --> 01:00:00.090
their fish.

f01d6b37-60f6-4cb8-9a8f-77e315d3bc55-0
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.441
swimming  around in the water in
there, the Prince has the red

f01d6b37-60f6-4cb8-9a8f-77e315d3bc55-1
01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:11.128
crayon, so he is going to draw
something to get them out of

f01d6b37-60f6-4cb8-9a8f-77e315d3bc55-2
01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:15.815
this mess, and the purple bird
is still swimming along with

f01d6b37-60f6-4cb8-9a8f-77e315d3bc55-3
01:00:15.815 --> 01:00:17.299
them at this point.

a03416aa-543e-4adb-8746-001cbb18de6e-0
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.764
He draws a red submarine, so
they are in the submarine now.

a03416aa-543e-4adb-8746-001cbb18de6e-1
01:00:24.764 --> 01:00:28.595
The father, the Prince and the
purple bird are in a red

a03416aa-543e-4adb-8746-001cbb18de6e-2
01:00:28.595 --> 01:00:30.990
submarine going through the
water.

1f90aaa8-28c3-4574-9d0b-168741901ea4-0
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.880
The red submarine comes out.

33f00e27-6172-48d2-a448-5811d6c46601-0
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.800
And they come into a cave that
looks like it has.

29cb42f6-0f8e-411c-95a5-8b045062950f-0
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.010
Drawings cave drawings.

93277031-379b-4ba1-a262-19f8be36f67f-0
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.920
From a long, long time ago.

12f1a483-4c30-4c2e-8ed1-bca6ca9944bf-0
01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:00.110
So we're looking into multiple
drawings that were made.

ab2f9f2d-4737-4c3b-94a8-2dbd723a9fce-0
01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:03.960
And they are looking up at all
the drawings.

25910ec1-d953-48c0-9557-0bef97ce2666-0
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:10.680
As they come out with the
submarine into this cave like

25910ec1-d953-48c0-9557-0bef97ce2666-1
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.070
area

2500fdc6-34af-4c13-9bba-e153317517b1-0
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:17.470
Continue to look at the.

0ace1d55-ecb4-4648-a4e0-fba28dfffee8-0
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.668
The Prince is showing a certain
one to the father and the purple

0ace1d55-ecb4-4648-a4e0-fba28dfffee8-1
01:01:29.668 --> 01:01:33.230
bird is the lights on one of the
rocks.

2e08da11-1165-4d9a-b42a-75b191db893d-0
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.170
Hmm.

fb0da113-03a0-4859-b339-5c82cf0e14fc-0
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.469
Let's see, we continued. Look at
these hieroglyphics, petroglyphs

fb0da113-03a0-4859-b339-5c82cf0e14fc-1
01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:49.120
and the.

2ee9bfcb-5ea9-4c60-bd45-c85077a54917-0
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:56.081
The ship that was chasing them
is now coming toward them

2ee9bfcb-5ea9-4c60-bd45-c85077a54917-1
01:01:56.081 --> 01:01:59.770
through the mouth of The Cave
and the father.

6c9bd2df-3593-438f-921a-e63640f44da8-0
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.100
Grabs a crayon of some.

4a9475ab-1334-47c4-a1b1-b48d5f4cbf91-0
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.330
Color looks like it's brown and
he is drawing.

f2381b84-b67a-4c1b-b1e1-228d858981ca-0
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.540
A perch for the purple bird.

baa6bcf2-5570-43a1-b31c-86ae3e6ac67a-0
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.712
Now the man with the magical,
the enemy with the magical box

baa6bcf2-5570-43a1-b31c-86ae3e6ac67a-1
01:02:22.712 --> 01:02:27.270
that seems to tear things apart,
is aiming it at the purple bird.

be4b973c-1081-4295-a979-e32d89fae27a-0
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:31.721
And we are worried about the
purple bird. What is going to

be4b973c-1081-4295-a979-e32d89fae27a-1
01:02:31.721 --> 01:02:35.390
happen with the purple bird? It
looks like he is able to.

47f16b42-63b3-405a-9b22-43bebdefc77c-0
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.530
Catch the purple bird into that
box.

12aa6803-1497-42d8-9180-dfc5c5ebcd01-0
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:45.553
It looks like you killed the
bird. Looks like you killed the

12aa6803-1497-42d8-9180-dfc5c5ebcd01-1
01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:50.484
bird and the father was very
angry about this and grabs the

12aa6803-1497-42d8-9180-dfc5c5ebcd01-2
01:02:50.484 --> 01:02:52.210
box and puts the man.

1813b8f3-c6d7-4f33-be40-f0e20818b190-0
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.300
The enemy into the cage.

81fdd8f2-ca36-4d17-8f60-012b31596764-0
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.900
When he when the father breaks
the box apart, it looks like.

3523d725-9e77-41d8-bf83-2d21c78f2208-0
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.979
The purple dragon comes back out
and the purple bird comes back

3523d725-9e77-41d8-bf83-2d21c78f2208-1
01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:16.939
out and there's glowing colors
all over the place. Yellow,

3523d725-9e77-41d8-bf83-2d21c78f2208-2
01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:21.730
green, red, purple, blue. And
the king is there with the

3523d725-9e77-41d8-bf83-2d21c78f2208-3
01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:26.270
Prince and they're looking on in
awe and the enemies.

8adc1e3f-5ca9-46a9-b624-765f83fd23b4-0
01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.010
Look like they're devastated by
this event.

d6b9d94f-654f-48a9-8978-165747e771a8-0
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:42.056
We see multi colored birds
flying in the air, including the

d6b9d94f-654f-48a9-8978-165747e771a8-1
01:03:42.056 --> 01:03:46.540
Purple Dragon holding on to the
cage and the father.

d6fc54ad-2971-407d-aeb9-4d72d9556226-0
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:52.734
And the daughter, the king, the
Prince and the Purple bird

d6fc54ad-2971-407d-aeb9-4d72d9556226-1
01:03:52.734 --> 01:03:55.720
looking on as the boat goes off.

62ef2fa2-0872-47e1-b3d0-0cd769185bde-0
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.940
And the father and the daughter
are happy to be reunited.

7c03bf99-86f3-4493-964d-a190368d439b-0
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.060
They see the door.

73da17ba-a973-4d80-a7fe-b6b623d57ba1-0
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:10.020
With the kite tail and it looks
like it, they can go back

73da17ba-a973-4d80-a7fe-b6b623d57ba1-1
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.550
through to their other life,
yeah.

219a5ca4-eff1-4bd0-b4fa-5e90a2fa2d21-0
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:21.441
And we see the House where this
started, and we see the red

219a5ca4-eff1-4bd0-b4fa-5e90a2fa2d21-1
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:25.220
light flying in the air outside
the House.

0ca39210-320a-45bd-bd15-4026d8eea76e-0
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:26.850
with the door open. #END_return 

6b315fda-1504-4088-b006-61437b695e60-0
01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:34.761
OK, yeah. So that was the story
then. Moving on, this item is

6b315fda-1504-4088-b006-61437b695e60-1
01:04:34.761 --> 01:04:37.020
actually a complex scene.

91c71c40-661e-4e0d-bc96-6016d9aa30b1-0
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.098
So please describe what you see
in detail and please take

91c71c40-661e-4e0d-bc96-6016d9aa30b1-1
01:04:43.098 --> 01:04:45.430
between three and five minutes.

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-0
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:51.855
#START_picture_this There are a
number of framed portraits on

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-1
01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:55.901
this page, all sorts of rain
portraits, and there are

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-2
01:04:55.901 --> 01:05:00.246
portraits of dogs. There are
portraits of people that are

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-3
01:05:00.246 --> 01:05:04.967
portraits of animals and like
for instance there's a there's a

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-4
01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:09.762
man and a bear in one. There is
a picture of a cactus. There is

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-5
01:05:09.762 --> 01:05:14.632
a picture of a man hanging over
a fence that looks like he might

7590b472-886e-450e-930b-eff64a4f3f1e-6
01:05:14.632 --> 01:05:16.880
be drunk or something because.

7b7b8037-874e-480c-a177-a57531c8706e-0
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.790
Doesn't look like he's in full

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-0
01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:25.249
He's capable of doing much else
other than laying over the

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-1
01:05:25.249 --> 01:05:29.599
fence. Here is a it looks like a
hippopotamus in one picture.

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-2
01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:34.019
These look like pictures from
someone's travels, where they've

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-3
01:05:34.019 --> 01:05:37.668
gone all over the world and
they've taken all these

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-4
01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:42.158
pictures. There is somebody that
looks like they're on a bumper

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-5
01:05:42.158 --> 01:05:46.157
car. There is someone that
there's a gorilla. There is a

8b46e98e-175a-4b26-99a7-c6c3312e4622-6
01:05:46.157 --> 01:05:47.210
hand. There is.

d8359dee-37cf-4e9e-8af8-72e3a918b3d7-0
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:53.897
A pot and a dog. There is a
mummy. There is a tree that has

d8359dee-37cf-4e9e-8af8-72e3a918b3d7-1
01:05:53.897 --> 01:05:56.830
a base on it. There is an
airplane.

04ffdbe9-737d-4444-988d-a9456642c14b-0
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.320
There is a.

fcbc0118-7350-4032-b79d-30194b0b1b5f-0
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:06.077
Set of shoes. There is a man
that looks like he's in awe of a

fcbc0118-7350-4032-b79d-30194b0b1b5f-1
01:06:06.077 --> 01:06:11.850
dinosaur looking creature. There
is a number of very odd looking

fcbc0118-7350-4032-b79d-30194b0b1b5f-2
01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:16.736
creatures that looks like
they're in costume and there

fcbc0118-7350-4032-b79d-30194b0b1b5f-3
01:06:16.736 --> 01:06:21.000
are, there is looks like a
Campbell. There's a.

9c7b7a66-02b4-4fe8-9d6e-b8e6b02eaa35-0
01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:28.745
 two Vikings, there are people
having a fight. There is someone

9c7b7a66-02b4-4fe8-9d6e-b8e6b02eaa35-1
01:06:28.745 --> 01:06:29.850
on a horse.

fac3b734-a65e-4e2d-9d37-f5fa62efdb31-0
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.315
There are, oh, there's so many
just portraits of people just

fac3b734-a65e-4e2d-9d37-f5fa62efdb31-1
01:06:36.315 --> 01:06:41.170
standing, and they're also
portraits of people sitting. And

fac3b734-a65e-4e2d-9d37-f5fa62efdb31-2
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:45.943
there are porches of just faces.
People's faces. There's a

fac3b734-a65e-4e2d-9d37-f5fa62efdb31-3
01:06:45.943 --> 01:06:46.510
dragon.

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-0
01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.867
It looks like there is one man
that's fighting a dragon with

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-1
01:06:52.867 --> 01:06:57.341
his spear. There is a Joker.
There is two men with hats.

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-2
01:06:57.341 --> 01:07:02.442
Look. It looks like they're from
medieval times. There was a man

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-3
01:07:02.442 --> 01:07:07.386
that has about 12 hats on the
top of his head and he's holding

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-4
01:07:07.386 --> 01:07:12.409
two other hats. There's one man
who was being dragged by a dog.

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-5
01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:16.961
There are just two people
walking along. There are, there

527b67b9-b050-42ff-9698-5f62d30087f7-6
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:18.610
was a bird on a nest.

ecd65b1e-7f04-47e5-a50a-e7af036616c0-0
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:24.154
There is so many different
things. There is a cat and a dog

ecd65b1e-7f04-47e5-a50a-e7af036616c0-1
01:07:24.154 --> 01:07:27.960
who look like they really like
each other is.

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-0
01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.045
Where's Waldo? There's Waldo
right in the middle of all this,

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-1
01:07:34.045 --> 01:07:38.261
there is a deer that has a deer
that looks like he is holding a

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-2
01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:42.544
sword on his antlers. And there
is some things that I can't even

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-3
01:07:42.544 --> 01:07:46.563
describe because they're so
strange looking. It's so hard to

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-4
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.780
know what some of these things
are in this. In this portrait of

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-5
01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.129
things, it looks like somebody's
holding a palm tree and possibly

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-6
01:07:55.129 --> 01:07:58.818
shaking down some coconuts on
someone that looks like a

558a9e45-bbe6-4866-b2fe-b2271341071e-7
01:07:58.818 --> 01:07:59.280
dragon.

1626a579-f016-4ed0-a192-f038fb203680-0
01:07:59.350 --> 01:07:59.970
That is.

4c6b735d-c3b0-4c80-b976-0045783e4154-0
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.806
I don't know. Kind of mad at
somebody and she looks like

4c6b735d-c3b0-4c80-b976-0045783e4154-1
01:08:05.806 --> 01:08:09.330
she's afraid. One little, just
one Kitty in a portrait.

6c546444-588a-4a8c-a914-465eaae3839c-0
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:15.850
Ohh, just so many people doing
so many different things. One

6c546444-588a-4a8c-a914-465eaae3839c-1
01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:21.393
person on a motorcycle. One
person walking off outside of

6c546444-588a-4a8c-a914-465eaae3839c-2
01:08:21.393 --> 01:08:26.650
the framed portrait. Somebody
looks like Daniel Boone.

d6d7d926-0b3d-47bc-b65b-2dfc6cf3a037-0
01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:32.716
Ohh my
goodness. OK, all kinds of

d6d7d926-0b3d-47bc-b65b-2dfc6cf3a037-1
01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:36.670
things. Someone's on a fountain
flying around on the water.

d6d7d926-0b3d-47bc-b65b-2dfc6cf3a037-2
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:39.240
Yes, I think that's about it
for me. #END_picture_this 

1e74a0ac-a6d3-4f8b-bab1-53dcee2ec9ae-0
01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:47.750
OK, we can go. So we can go to
the next, uh, the last one.

b013455e-ebee-4d63-9db0-9feab4b48fc8-0
01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:56.550
That the last item for today if
I just closed it, OK.

ae042319-59fa-4b57-aa22-2c1d290406f7-0
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.460
We'll do, let's see, two
complex scenes and then we'll be

ae042319-59fa-4b57-aa22-2c1d290406f7-1
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.090
done. So this one.

3a8b26d8-4e41-4b45-9957-3d8ccc55e4bb-0
01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:27.130


c5aa0a67-ce1a-4d7e-bea1-591ae21a0f5a-0
01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:47.130


5f698a99-4ea1-43d1-8815-9a78c48daef5-0
01:09:55.990 --> 01:10:00.057
You can start talking about it
whenever you're ready. OK.

01:10:00.057 --> 01:10:04.056
#START_deep_sea_divers This is a
scene of deep sea divers.

5f698a99-4ea1-43d1-8815-9a78c48daef5-2
01:10:04.056 --> 01:10:08.123
There's all sorts of things
going on in this sea. There are

5f698a99-4ea1-43d1-8815-9a78c48daef5-3
01:10:08.123 --> 01:10:12.055
many mermaids. There are all
sorts of fish, some swimming

5f698a99-4ea1-43d1-8815-9a78c48daef5-4
01:10:12.055 --> 01:10:16.258
around in schools or in circles.
There's a big octopus there.

5f698a99-4ea1-43d1-8815-9a78c48daef5-5
01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:19.580
There is coral. And this scene
there is a giant.

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-0
01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.863
fish at the very bottom of the
ocean. There are clams. There is

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-1
01:10:23.863 --> 01:10:27.981
a treasure chest with a little
creature, but I don't know what

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-2
01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:32.165
it is peaking out of it, there
are many, many people. Now, it's

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-3
01:10:32.165 --> 01:10:36.152
not clear to me what they're
doing. Some people are standing

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-4
01:10:36.152 --> 01:10:40.205
at the bottom of this scene,
which you would think they would

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-5
01:10:40.205 --> 01:10:43.800
be swimming, but they're
actually standing down there.

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-6
01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.396
Some people are swimming
throughout the scene and they

db259bb3-c890-4509-8e13-9d02f8373a50-7
01:10:47.396 --> 01:10:50.730
are doing different things. Some
people have nuts.

3af4cf55-21fc-49fd-8354-8487f790dfb1-0
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:55.674
Where they're trying to possibly
have some fish or Spears, and

3af4cf55-21fc-49fd-8354-8487f790dfb1-1
01:10:55.674 --> 01:11:00.298
let's see, there are so many
different types of fish. There

blue fish.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.716
Let's see, even, some of the
fish have a net one of the fish

01219dc7-5e4f-4c28-b361-c0b7decb8d9e-1
01:11:11.716 --> 01:11:16.039

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:20.435
And he is holding a net like he
wants to catch some of these

01219dc7-5e4f-4c28-b361-c0b7decb8d9e-3
01:11:20.435 --> 01:11:25.048

boats on the top of this scene
on the top of the water and they

01219dc7-5e4f-4c28-b361-c0b7decb8d9e-5
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:34.128
are some of them putting down
anchors from their boats. There

01219dc7-5e4f-4c28-b361-c0b7decb8d9e-6
01:11:34.128 --> 01:11:38.020
are some that are throwing in
nuts to catch some fish

air. There is a lot of mermaids

top. There are people that are.

01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:54.707
Sinking in their boat, which is
sad. And let's see a number of

eed1046a-fb3c-4d8c-a46d-06513a87409b-1
01:11:54.707 --> 01:11:59.465
people standing on their boats
trying to catch really big fish

eed1046a-fb3c-4d8c-a46d-06513a87409b-2
01:11:59.465 --> 01:12:03.996
that are in in the ocean. There
are eels swimming around in

eed1046a-fb3c-4d8c-a46d-06513a87409b-3
01:12:03.996 --> 01:12:08.602

01:12:08.602 --> 01:12:13.360
fish all over the place. And it
is, there are some people that

eed1046a-fb3c-4d8c-a46d-06513a87409b-5
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.193
are way, way down there and they
are doing all sorts of things.

eed1046a-fb3c-4d8c-a46d-06513a87409b-6
01:12:18.193 --> 01:12:19.930
Let's see some of them.

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:26.110
have big packs on their backs,
and some of them are holding

c95a6f89-c48d-4c95-9996-509939a275f4-1
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:29.160
Spears and Nets and let's see.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.640
A lot of coral which is nice to
see.

979fa018-8bab-471a-bd46-c2c2aa5e221b-0
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.840
Let's see, that looks like
there's sand along the bottom.

7b2e8750-8fd3-4e63-830e-7eccd265a4a7-0
01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:45.990

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:52.867
Sardines in a can down there,
and I see a number of plans over

1e070a19-6885-4543-810d-f6804323a674-1
01:12:52.867 --> 01:12:58.229
there on the right side and some
flying fish flying through the

1e070a19-6885-4543-810d-f6804323a674-2
01:12:58.229 --> 01:13:03.088
air there and the sea and
somebody jumping into the water

1e070a19-6885-4543-810d-f6804323a674-3
01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:08.366
to go swimming from the top of
the boat. And there is somebody

1e070a19-6885-4543-810d-f6804323a674-4
01:13:08.366 --> 01:13:12.890
that is fishing that looks like
they caught a person.

04dc9841-c11c-4f6f-9116-4dba74cd6e33-0
01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.433
and boats all over the place on
the top and they are mostly

04dc9841-c11c-4f6f-9116-4dba74cd6e33-1

striped with blue and green and
red.

9174f8bc-42d9-4278-a27d-163bf69f0202-0
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.620
And there's
one very tall sailing ship way

9174f8bc-42d9-4278-a27d-163bf69f0202-1
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.224
in the distance, and I think
that's about it. OK? Hopefully

9174f8bc-42d9-4278-a27d-163bf69f0202-2
01:13:31.224 --> 01:13:34.421
a lot of fish and a lot of
people swimming around down

9174f8bc-42d9-4278-a27d-163bf69f0202-3
01:13:34.421 --> 01:13:34.770

And this will be the last one we
do.

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-0
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:52.184
#START_wild_west OK, looks like
we're in the wild, Wild West

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-1
01:13:52.184 --> 01:13:56.098
here with a lot of saloons. Oh
my goodness. Hotels, saloons,

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-2
01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:59.692
jails. Let's see, what else?
What do we have? We've got

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-3
01:13:59.692 --> 01:14:03.798
people all over the place doing
all kinds of things. Let's see.

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-4
01:14:03.798 --> 01:14:07.777
We've got a jail and we have a
sheriff there. We have someone

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-5
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:11.884
pushing a baby in a carriage in
front of the jail. We have some

53cdb50b-7808-46fd-a5ee-d00e676be1eb-6
01:14:11.884 --> 01:14:13.360
wanted signs so we can.

1c376075-c0d4-4d5e-adb8-2f73adcb6306-0
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:17.930
See who the criminals are there.
And the town is just full of

1c376075-c0d4-4d5e-adb8-2f73adcb6306-1
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:22.212

Stagecoach, there is a train.
There are so many different

01:14:26.422 --> 01:14:31.213
salons. It's unbelievable. Let's
see. There's the pioneer saloon.

1c376075-c0d4-4d5e-adb8-2f73adcb6306-4
01:14:31.213 --> 01:14:35.495
There is one more saloon. There
is another saloon, another

1c376075-c0d4-4d5e-adb8-2f73adcb6306-5
01:14:35.495 --> 01:14:39.777
salon. They don't even have
names. There's so many salons.

1c376075-c0d4-4d5e-adb8-2f73adcb6306-6
01:14:39.777 --> 01:14:43.770
The Tame E saloon. There is a
bank, there is a livery.

5384ec09-cee2-4453-9bdd-402d16ef1977-0
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.981
Unstable. They are calling it
with a blacksmith who's working

5384ec09-cee2-4453-9bdd-402d16ef1977-1
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:50.780
on some horseshoes that looks
like over there.

ab24dd4d-3126-4558-83d3-900f25e1ec5e-0
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.030
Now let's see.

2ca5f577-2450-4862-8f71-8801bc618c3d-0
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.271
We have a number of people
walking around, just walking

2ca5f577-2450-4862-8f71-8801bc618c3d-1
01:14:59.271 --> 01:15:04.740
around the town and it looks
like some people are painting

2ca5f577-2450-4862-8f71-8801bc618c3d-2
01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:09.931

unbelievable amounts of people
in this.

9fb8bc07-9e8e-41ed-94e3-b94c27fd7a4f-0
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:18.302
Scene mostly just, it looks like
most of them are just walking

9fb8bc07-9e8e-41ed-94e3-b94c27fd7a4f-1
01:15:18.302 --> 01:15:20.310
around, walking around the town.

38e7d434-87af-4803-a642-4f3dc582f623-0
01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:21.710
Um.

640645d8-ddf8-44d6-a4ef-d02d447a9d69-0
01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:28.629
We do have a gold mine over to
the left. It's a gold mine and

640645d8-ddf8-44d6-a4ef-d02d447a9d69-1
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:33.963

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:37.350
the different roofs all over the
place.

1148c38a-5cca-4919-aec7-f4cc637e381a-0
01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:41.625
It looks like some people are
fighting on top of the one

1148c38a-5cca-4919-aec7-f4cc637e381a-1
01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:41.990
saloon.

01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:46.640
It looks like they're flipping
some ropes around at each other.

816b67c6-dd8f-42fb-8042-e207f50e849a-0
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.370
So we've got some covered wagons
along the street.

46aa3336-b316-48fd-a022-08af0508ea2c-0
01:15:56.390 --> 01:16:01.346
We've got looks like somebody is
robbing the saloon because he's

46aa3336-b316-48fd-a022-08af0508ea2c-1
01:16:01.346 --> 01:16:03.710
got a mask on and he's holding.

243cad97-ca7d-4a38-9502-4f6cc8eb359a-0
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:08.775
A house that has a dollar sign
on it, like he's holding some

243cad97-ca7d-4a38-9502-4f6cc8eb359a-1
01:16:08.775 --> 01:16:09.780
money in there.

05bbe4bb-225a-40a5-aa58-9f286c3d81fd-0
01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:12.520
Let's see.

42f909c9-6225-4d45-8a71-6d4d1ef1765f-0
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:17.416
We've got some people in front
of the one saloon making some

42f909c9-6225-4d45-8a71-6d4d1ef1765f-1
01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:20.655
music on a piano and some
different musical instruments,

42f909c9-6225-4d45-8a71-6d4d1ef1765f-2
01:16:20.655 --> 01:16:24.121
and we've got some people in
white coats. It looks like it's

42f909c9-6225-4d45-8a71-6d4d1ef1765f-3
01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:27.701
a medical convention. I'm not
sure what that's all about. Over

42f909c9-6225-4d45-8a71-6d4d1ef1765f-4
01:16:27.701 --> 01:16:30.770

Umm.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:37.441
And people waving at him as he's
going off into the distance, it

01:16:37.441 --> 01:16:38.060

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.564

738bbac8-3d89-433d-863f-d68b34213a72-1
