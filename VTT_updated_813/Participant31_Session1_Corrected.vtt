00e4c7e9-10fd-44f7-995b-edf75a959cad-0
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.591
OK, so the first thing that
you're going to see is a graphic

00e4c7e9-10fd-44f7-995b-edf75a959cad-1
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:09.110
novel.

88b10597-dbed-439e-a29a-9ff2b5653f60-0
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.410
So for graphic novels, you're
going to see a series of

88b10597-dbed-439e-a29a-9ff2b5653f60-1
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.495
pictures that tell a story.
Imagine you are telling the

88b10597-dbed-439e-a29a-9ff2b5653f60-2
00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:20.077
story to someone who cannot see
the pictures. We're going to ask

88b10597-dbed-439e-a29a-9ff2b5653f60-3
00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:23.548
that you describe what you see
and what is happening as you go

88b10597-dbed-439e-a29a-9ff2b5653f60-4
00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:24.540
through the story.

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-0
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.676
And for each story, I'll tell
you how many slides it is. And

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-1
00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:33.547
usually with stories, they take
up roughly between 10 to 15

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-2
00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.741
minutes to tell. And I also keep
like a timer. So if I if I need

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-3
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:41.806
you to talk a little bit more
about the picture or move along,

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-4
00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:45.807
I'll let you know. And since
they're PowerPoints, once you're

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-5
00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:49.743
done describing a page you could
tell me to flip to the next

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-6
00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:53.421
page, I'll pull up the story
right now and I'll share my

67a7c205-d2a8-4acd-88ed-c1e7e1b0e181-7
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.260
screen again.

4160cfff-a6bf-439d-acb8-3d52561f846b-0
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.851
So I have to tell this study
that I see. Yep. So it's just a

4160cfff-a6bf-439d-acb8-3d52561f846b-1
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.509
wordless picture book and you'll
just describe what you're seeing

4160cfff-a6bf-439d-acb8-3d52561f846b-2
00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.450
and what's happening in the
story.

330c1312-1a61-44ab-b69d-b62bbe6ad76e-0
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.670
Let me pull up this one page.

9bb99b7d-bdb8-4a35-aa23-30eddf2b6789-0
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.273
Yes, so I'll share my screen and
you'll see how it's set up one

9bb99b7d-bdb8-4a35-aa23-30eddf2b6789-1
00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:17.740

OK.

2963e0f3-87b0-4fbf-9e5e-226efb186809-0
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.531
So this is what it'll look like.
So it'll have the spread of the

2963e0f3-87b0-4fbf-9e5e-226efb186809-1
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:49.947

00:01:49.947 --> 00:01:51.200
flip through the page.

2876834d-39fc-4671-afdc-de83aa9e21d7-0

ab73820c-e05c-4ac8-a6e4-1c2ff4a4eb3a-0

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.980
And daylight.

fdf1b01d-b4d8-420e-bcfc-e18b2131634c-0
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.380

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.610
But then he's lonely again.

124a717a-1e53-44a4-b0c0-5dd2c17090d6-0
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.470
Now.
