Alrighty, so continuing with our

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.169
two types of pictures that we
show you. Umm, this is a complex

463aba28-9004-4969-9a66-55d0fd468bc2-2
00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.543
scene. Imagine you're describing
the scene of someone who cannot

463aba28-9004-4969-9a66-55d0fd468bc2-3
00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:19.849

463aba28-9004-4969-9a66-55d0fd468bc2-4
00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.886
this scene as thoroughly as
possible and take between three

463aba28-9004-4969-9a66-55d0fd468bc2-5
00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:25.299
and five minutes, OK?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.300

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.350
The pioneer saloon.

fe565187-1f67-4787-b0ec-41c30929f08f-0
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.860

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.370
Another saloon, tame east
saloon, I think it says.

8b065df0-f6c3-42da-97e2-baf4b08427ca-0
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.230

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.850
Livery unstable.

44125343-a68f-49c8-86db-bd2873e2ef94-0

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.624
And some man is is climbing up
the ladder on the top putting

7cf3be0c-8e0d-4d76-a8e8-fe96ed8c4d1d-1
00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:35.952
sign out and these people are
standing around looking at a

7cf3be0c-8e0d-4d76-a8e8-fe96ed8c4d1d-2
00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:38.300

0daf4e0f-13c3-4956-b99b-c6f9be4f99e8-0
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.170
Like a drive-in

5711a901-2714-4a0e-acfd-d92268f5d887-0
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.870
Theater.

66bbb11e-436c-4fcb-be8d-16aa3c2cbbc6-0
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.160
But they're standing up. They're
not in cars.

e4249b54-26e8-4fe2-ba12-43918d6e88c1-0
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.450
And uh, so now I see another
pioneer saloon, a bank.

59edd7e9-86e0-4199-a792-af4f40c2e957-0
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.650

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.100
Looks like having, you know, one
big party or something.

ccbee55f-e886-46cf-b955-0cf697cfa238-0
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.770

Buffalo, but it looks like
Buffalo stamps.

e08d2da5-63ac-4048-8555-3a9536f77466-0
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.830

eff56dd4-dfe6-4527-896c-a3fb01fd65cb-0

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.950
People are on the roof.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.260
Climbing up ladders.

And I don't know what this is.

e5e9c65c-02a5-4cf5-b533-4036bec4a0b1-0
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.171
Well, OK, OK. The livery stable.
So let me see. I see a horse in

e5e9c65c-02a5-4cf5-b533-4036bec4a0b1-1
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:20.930
a covered wagon.

2175a2a3-33dd-45a4-bd56-0b782060b295-0
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.910

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.000
That's it. #END_wild_west

6a9de0c9-d171-4ae4-b333-afeef1c092c3-0
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.810

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.440
So another complex scene.

dfcd242a-707e-4f49-904f-547774bab973-0
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.300
You can start when you're ready.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.460
This is the same one.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.520
Oh, did you not see something
changed?

0b090938-5d8c-4ba1-a962-1c758190a2f4-0

Oh, it takes a while, OK.

aab55171-b591-4f14-890c-ff78aee61f61-0
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.640
#START_being_a_pirate OK, these
are pirate ships.

aed84ac6-2ec7-4ead-8690-98322f8bb84b-0
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.220
Surrounded by little boats,
lifeboats I'm assuming, and with

aed84ac6-2ec7-4ead-8690-98322f8bb84b-1
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.570

Then there's another pirate
ship.

2847f2e8-1dfd-4c75-bfcc-380b05f8ec68-0
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.130

72539b12-2a5c-475e-bf57-2d9b069b9760-0
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.970
Crawling across the sail.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.610
And then I see a shore.

22ad02b2-e24a-4abf-be58-89d1513ef1bf-0
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.710

My cat just wants my attention.

002895eb-80c0-40d5-bfcd-678ef2120c4e-0
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.170

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.450
All the little boats seem to be
heading for the shore.

4a7da371-0b67-49de-9fc5-e7247fa3d313-0
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.790

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.510
{Is that long enough? That was
about 2 1/2 minutes, so.

1724a0b7-7fd5-4570-83fd-d6360a1a1fc1-0
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.950
OK, so.}

3f17c0c8-5f95-48ee-9a3c-a7eb520ac067-0

Ohh, cannons blowing off.

37470e26-93be-4cea-8cba-2def5bbdc45a-0
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.970
And.

5e9738c9-302f-474a-9176-919c4ed914ec-0

That's. Hmm. I don't see nothing
else. #END_being_a_pirate OK,

3996c58a-9601-49e1-a2e3-ecad277a2e2e-1
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.780
well, then we can go on. OK.

9c48e572-9743-4b5c-8070-be58ccba77cf-0
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.787
Now you're going to see a
graphic novel, which is a series

9c48e572-9743-4b5c-8070-be58ccba77cf-1
00:06:32.787 --> 00:06:37.035
of pictures that tell a story.
So describe what you see and

9c48e572-9743-4b5c-8070-be58ccba77cf-2
00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:40.930
what is happening as you go
through the story and take

9c48e572-9743-4b5c-8070-be58ccba77cf-3
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.320
between 10 to 15 minutes. So
this this one has about 5 pages.

33707cbb-2bab-409f-9140-39af76cfbf25-0
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.970
OK.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.670
#START_arrival_1 OK, first let's

2a86f9ba-9a4f-4cf1-bda3-ac7b75d6728e-0
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.740
Man, woman and child.

cfacd5de-87fa-4ed8-b706-8e58696bed8a-0
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.390
And then somebody takes this
picture off the wall.

f41fb220-8c07-4afb-a7d3-764573b1171d-0
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.189
And is wrapping it up because I
see the hand and the next

f41fb220-8c07-4afb-a7d3-764573b1171d-1
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.390
picture they're wrapping it.

5793f012-878d-4aee-9be8-76566db70a20-0
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.350
And.

db0b4d4d-07d1-49b2-ab21-d9ba43dc6e16-0
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.910
And the next picture I see.

aa05b76e-b189-4af9-9e66-d853b28c4ff0-0
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.230
Them tying it up.

4e665481-afa7-435a-b3b9-ceb5acb81d36-0
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.510
{Mm-hmm.}

51e5f71b-a6a6-4610-ac36-2ffc4c8b3755-0
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.170
And putting it in a suitcase.

8364a083-722f-416b-be55-7266b7272902-0
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.500
Closing this suitcase.

7f17512a-67da-4288-b13a-a992a7c2a525-0
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.020
Uh, OK, Ty, tightening the belt
around a suitcase.

6625843d-c5c8-4a02-bbd3-d16c0a49758b-0
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.780
And.

41c33483-2706-498a-bc73-67bd2a061cfa-0
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.970
Getting ready to go on a trip,
I'm assuming.

5a7e09a3-bfd4-4f27-898c-3ab293ecc18a-0
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.910
OK.

ebcc47e5-a8f4-4471-b235-b0ff4f4fbaa9-0
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.250
Now I see a origami bird.

61f8722d-aaa1-40c8-b7a1-a2c139ca7b96-0
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.570
A clock.

381fb23b-0782-44b0-9ce8-3b2506628cc1-0
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.880
Hat and coat hanging up on the
wall.

bac3d8d1-9bf9-46ba-9f80-24945a6ab671-0
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.140
A pot and a spoon.

c1b60f44-eb91-4549-ae10-2018da026e8b-0
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.000
A drawn picture by a child.

a16b6497-cf01-4624-8c02-e27c9d7261af-0
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.100
Um.

bd8ecead-8041-4f90-bfd8-ee3a784f18d4-0
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.930
A man and her, the person who
wrote drew it. A teapot.

013d054f-d69b-49c9-95f2-838aaced0061-0
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.160
A cup.

4e0986d6-28f3-4674-be7d-59a8347915b6-0
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:23.000
And pictures, one picture of a
boat or a luxury liner.

22e232c8-c953-417e-a720-afa5288c8ba3-0
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.710
Then the next picture is. This
is the suitcase.

d8ea7a1f-2a38-4b86-bea4-551f06f4353d-0
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.320
And picture we saw in the first
one, man, woman and child.

8d08ef31-1e2d-4627-a90d-f627223bc4bc-0
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.610
And OK, so this picture shows
where all of those things go.

d9952ce6-c021-4a3f-b8ad-97a6cade3c85-0
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:47.830
In this picture, and he is and
his wife is helping him.

65414def-10de-437a-8bf8-1d62f8fc5900-0
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.160
Um.

a5288493-6576-468f-88b6-79aa4241aec4-0
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.320
Pack. helping her back help
helping him pack.

a1f0ec5b-b787-41c3-870e-6bbb2f270cdb-0
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.020
Yeah.

b15ba2ec-de7e-4972-a735-85fc138ccb65-0
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.630
OK, so now I see a woman asleep
with the covers on her face. Or

b15ba2ec-de7e-4972-a735-85fc138ccb65-1
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.360
a child. Yeah now there's a
child.

06e75b1d-b32e-4c4d-8617-cd7f913a9de5-0
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.230
And then the child peeps over
the cover.

13269911-9cb6-4ca6-a5fa-f78beb460c24-0
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.300
Yawn and rubs their eye.

fac0422d-1c6d-4c36-99c9-6ab519caaaa1-0
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.230
Now she's sitting at the table
eating breakfast.

4cfae850-4b70-4a16-8a5c-9bf1fe7f47c2-0
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.630
Here, she's sitting at the
table, still eating breakfast.

919832ed-b6f8-47dd-bdc8-a1e8a4d1caab-0
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.710
But then notices, um, the
suitcase.

287fb7c2-1da3-4915-8ada-c0cd9859719a-0
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.620
Up against the wall.

7f36ae6c-3f03-4fa9-9c39-619f15098467-0
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.610
Then her dad is putting on a
hat.

2ec11dc7-03d2-4de5-bbc1-e6bbdaa9033f-0
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.360
The mom is putting on her scarf.
She's putting on a hat.

385eb322-2c62-4064-8447-c9765b4671cd-0
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.550
Her boots.

d8c5a0a1-716f-4487-8bb3-05d13c0791a0-0
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.140
Coat.

cc24de06-19c5-40ef-b1ba-08b8844c1239-0
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.880
And.

18fea9ec-3c46-47de-ba8a-2073852bf001-0
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.960
Her father's reaching for her
hand.

74528468-7ea5-43d7-ae56-fb95c3279f09-0
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.123
Now in this picture I see the
three of them are going

74528468-7ea5-43d7-ae56-fb95c3279f09-1
00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:57.230
somewhere with the suitcase.

b216985d-881b-4f02-98e1-0e1edd32aa2c-0
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.880
And a Dragon's tail.

bf1261e3-bb1c-4a21-ad17-8e57ed76eb57-0
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.860
A shadow of a Dragon's tail.

8d2ee6fe-b407-4905-8073-4fed98fbcd91-0
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.760
OK, OK, so the little girl's
walking. She looks up.

de7fcfc3-5f00-4bbd-a38d-25a58def21b2-0
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.090
To the sky, then she looks
forward.

c9f761e2-4f6a-49ab-ba25-5b2ccc1b810d-0
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.320
Then she looks to her left.

923d51b5-5639-4592-8556-79ccda284aa5-0
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.390
This big picture is of a train.

78e5d91c-ea9b-406c-9c01-d66e81ae84a7-0
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.750
People with suitcases waiting
for the train.

34783581-a845-4c44-b696-e1881319cbda-0
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.371
Which I'm sure that's what
they're what they're getting

34783581-a845-4c44-b696-e1881319cbda-1
00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:33.880
ready to go.

2ca9fd18-0cf7-442e-9e67-950c6fd7406b-0
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.430
On the train or he is.

94f0c5a0-5c6b-48e2-b167-e0ee618dc1e6-0
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.100
OK, then he's talking to his
daughter. She's looking at him.

15370260-689a-4fbb-b16e-6f7a90d739c5-0
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:49.364
He takes his hat off and has the
origami bird, and then he gives

15370260-689a-4fbb-b16e-6f7a90d739c5-1
00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:50.410
it to her.

a62cc1a0-c474-4bea-805f-4d8001d7ee12-0
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.450
So he gives it to her. She's,
um, I guess, to remember him by

a62cc1a0-c474-4bea-805f-4d8001d7ee12-1
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.250
while while he's gone.

4cf23b0b-6421-4312-826a-6311511ac1f0-0
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.610
And, um, they hug.

2fa6b6a5-c140-4b92-96bc-4688750ba25b-0
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.582
Then the little girl holds the
is still holding the bird. The

2fa6b6a5-c140-4b92-96bc-4688750ba25b-1
00:11:08.582 --> 00:11:09.690
mom is crying.

12d25899-e110-4d09-9344-6652e53209b5-0
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.840
Because they're not going with
them. They hug.

97d94183-41e5-4ee6-8737-1a4370ca2438-0
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.570
He's whispering something in her
ear.

1e986a53-d3fa-4f67-93f7-9d623b5506ee-0
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.560
Then he gets on the train with
the suitcase, the three of them.

6487ac72-4a20-4513-86b1-649cbb35faaa-0
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.589
Are holding hands, saying
goodbye, then they have to let

6487ac72-4a20-4513-86b1-649cbb35faaa-1
00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:35.046
go. Then he gets on the train,
yeah, gets on the train. And the

6487ac72-4a20-4513-86b1-649cbb35faaa-2
00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:39.433
train is moving now. And in this
last one, the train is out of

6487ac72-4a20-4513-86b1-649cbb35faaa-3
00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.940
sight. You can still see the
smoke.

5116bc77-4aa8-4222-a21b-2c6a6ae11567-0
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.003
OK, this is the picture of the
man, woman, mom, dad and the

5116bc77-4aa8-4222-a21b-2c6a6ae11567-1
00:11:50.003 --> 00:11:50.940
little girl.

94a656a5-c3a3-42b2-98db-b48d3bc8e813-0
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.930
He's eating.

78bdc09c-5c8c-4526-b2c9-9c48d7055c2d-0
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.960
More than likely, he got to his
destination and he's eating.

4f9d2034-aefc-4848-835c-8b43b3826040-0
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.820
And looking at the picture.

dc1ec33d-8b70-46c5-ba89-a8782ac5e283-0
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.310
And then in the next picture,
looks like he's missing them.

adf859bc-c244-43e0-bb71-4fdb7abb89ae-0
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.030
And in this picture is the him
and the porthole.

35b00127-4f60-48db-a8dc-beef04ec69d7-0
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.460
Like somebody might be looking
at them.

54fe6a90-ad80-44cb-943a-fde2dd666237-0
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.540
And this way same thing, only
smaller.

c48435d2-a53e-49ff-8e6d-db4f390522bb-0
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.330
And then there's three
portholes.

490135a3-2ff3-49b7-a871-26a32b87b2fa-0
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:32.490
Here there's 2,4,6,8,9,10,11,12
portholes.

6f7e43b0-ed41-476e-8711-deebb66b2b67-0
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.897
And so and then the ship is
showing the ship and the ship is

6f7e43b0-ed41-476e-8711-deebb66b2b67-1
00:12:36.897 --> 00:12:38.940
in the middle of the ocean.
#END_arrival_1

cc1a9f87-e62c-4152-837c-5af029e43534-0
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:45.212
OK, so that was this part of the
story. OK, so then we're going

cc1a9f87-e62c-4152-837c-5af029e43534-1
00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:47.190
back to a complex scene.

be0466cc-3a88-4f12-84ff-0c638d36ac8f-0
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.440
#START_by_the_lake OK, these are
people having fun.

0d0dcc93-bbcf-48b7-a5a7-578aa0f0b1d1-0
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.750
In the lake.

202213c4-9227-4049-902d-28f7ab27d0df-0
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.870
I see a volleyball.

05ba66c7-ce5e-4741-b892-fabd3c578562-0
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.240
I mean.

ded1bfa7-6482-4835-8f41-3e7083c13c19-0
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.760
Yeah, volleyball. Net.

7d4ecc41-bdc1-4201-8842-2f1bee7ba26e-0
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.430
Um, a beach umbrella.

4fecb74f-93c3-4304-8691-31ddf563d3d3-0
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.590
People, of course, somebody with
a surfboard.

4b58f197-e57f-4c56-976a-af64d1006b1f-0
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.810
The piece there's people in the
water.

c6d73c55-82a2-40a3-bba2-38169f4d328a-0
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.890
There's somebody in the water.

63a1e0f5-3650-406c-a28a-d86a5f651cd3-0
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:29.208
On one of those rafts, just
relaxing. And I see a few boats,

63a1e0f5-3650-406c-a28a-d86a5f651cd3-1
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.340
little boats.

0e37f50b-72a3-4996-9235-427b5180b299-0
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.460
Rowboat.

b52e1e4e-6002-4ef9-b4db-3cf99331d6f2-0
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.480
And um.

cc7d76fd-f028-436d-a575-6aeb5dc57b91-0
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.231
Then there's some type of
platform with a bunch of kids on

cc7d76fd-f028-436d-a575-6aeb5dc57b91-1
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:40.400
it.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:48.164
So I you swim out to that and
you get on that and oh, I also

55a78058-d752-4685-b0f9-1ec01d6a99b3-1
00:13:48.164 --> 00:13:48.610
see.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.050
Hmm.

12ee1c2a-8b7a-4b75-a2af-e656750ff9a2-0
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.258
OK. I don't know what this is.
Maybe that maybe they're jet

12ee1c2a-8b7a-4b75-a2af-e656750ff9a2-1
00:13:56.258 --> 00:13:56.660
skiing.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.840
And of course, the houses
around. Sailboats.

762b68ac-f979-4f46-a491-aebd83cbb3c5-0
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:08.160
Uh, somebody is. I mean, they
build a pyramid.

3924cd15-90d2-4d3a-8da0-ae6d5eb5c7c0-0
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.150
And and I guess they're being
pulled by a boat.

d5cd3d06-91c4-4298-913f-df9acbbfef69-0
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.560
Then I see another ski

4edb8357-fad2-4f77-abf7-3afb05afed68-0
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.390
Water skier.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:27.127
And then over here I see, OK, I
see a boat with the head of a

4fdc53e1-c2e6-4475-b022-0c140aac532c-1
00:14:27.127 --> 00:14:27.730
dragon.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.760
Um.

f7abbb49-016b-4086-9ccd-d4e9026e4312-0
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.300
A sandcastle on this on the
land. I see a sandcastle.

8592f92f-e848-4872-b654-92c16e457de5-0
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.730
Umm.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.890
Look like some, no no.

bba7b59b-3ead-49a8-a888-bff2aceaff80-0
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.180
OK, I see a table.

662186ee-a6bd-468f-947f-8489bafd2567-0
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.290
A kite, dog.

ed08c8f8-ddbc-4b7e-81e2-27745715cfbf-0
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.660

A boat.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.380
That I guess she's getting ready
to push out into the water, or

e945124d-481f-4538-95b9-2ac1be9bcf94-1
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.420
they are. And up here, two
people riding a bike.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.480
Another beach umbrella.

f4220d3d-e289-48d1-bd84-b76312c51724-0
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.010
And people sitting at a picnic
table.

7cb86f96-0eaa-4d5f-80f4-dab463a60897-0
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.460
Watching all the festivities.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.020
#START_ancient_rome OK.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.640
Ancient Rome OK, so.

4849e1fa-7db8-431e-9527-c4ac456a1700-0
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.110
It looks like.

fbfa374d-b858-4ca8-a9aa-8c717946c6e2-0
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.270
Hmm, it looks like they're doing
something in this ring.

d7857f82-e8c0-47b5-b122-304bb654c5c9-0
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:49.064
Then they have people standing
around looking. I see a lion,

d7857f82-e8c0-47b5-b122-304bb654c5c9-1
00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:54.306
lions, three of them climbing up
this. That's a 4 or 5 anyway,

d7857f82-e8c0-47b5-b122-304bb654c5c9-2
00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:59.297
climbing up. Oh, I see what
they're doing. They're making a

d7857f82-e8c0-47b5-b122-304bb654c5c9-3
00:15:59.297 --> 00:16:04.040
pyramid so they can climb on
each other and and get out.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.670
And I see somebody.

37e067e5-55ab-4e54-b478-67e33da1c535-0
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.336
Hmm. I don't know what he's
doing, but somebody has his

37e067e5-55ab-4e54-b478-67e33da1c535-1
00:16:15.336 --> 00:16:15.620
feet.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.830
This guy has a either spear or
broom or something in his hand.

ae8e4aab-f9b1-40c3-b6c5-07df793e5e2a-0
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.570
And I see horses. A horse.

10a4d906-34bd-412e-be1e-fc414ffb8928-0
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.090
Oh yeah, in the back of the.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.330
The little chariot thing.

ce7a6386-6c9b-480c-88ed-9554c80b1955-0
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.870
With the people pulling them.

c304ac3c-6dd3-456a-816e-4064f55c06c2-0
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.980
instead of the way around and I
see people with pitchforks.

74f5e205-4233-4243-8f82-3f5918eb0bad-0
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.090
And tigers.

e58788f5-5815-46cc-afc7-8f5856028e5e-0
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.780
Or.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.980
Not tigers.

dfd83ffe-dc7c-4b52-9192-6f072fd1f76c-0
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.570
Leopards, I guess, because they
have spots and.

16cdea3a-cf6c-4550-9c34-778055c4fef1-0
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.480
Horses pulling another chariot.
More lions.

807d0672-fa43-4424-a1f2-6f6c0b0d2b65-0
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.110
Umm.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.470
Hmm. Two sword fighting, two
people sword fighting.

be87c961-b026-4287-88b0-54c1e2ffac83-0
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.770
A lion.

89ac838e-f323-43d1-a547-936b31753b9e-0
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.700
Up against the wall.

8aecaa26-84c3-4d43-ad60-4ff8ecb84ed0-0
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.740
Waiting for those two guys, I
guess, and.

d350aac2-8698-452b-bbe0-c2dea6aeb6b4-0
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:30.870
Hmm.

0d4955c9-6431-4a85-8aaa-8cbf61cc04c1-0
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.450
I think that's it.

OK.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.880
Here's a different one.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.290
Looks like some kind of water.

985dd79c-48dc-472a-8e28-a664145bf225-0
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:00.740
Hmm.

Home Park.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.650

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:18.470
And then you have people on the
sidewalk, somebody's fishing.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.460

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.940
It's like a tugboat and somebody
is on a bike.

86b18dbb-fdcc-4434-97dc-d8ff96505c2a-0
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.460
A dog.

blow up.

out what they are. I think

seeing the.

Look like a bunch of boats.

f66b74a5-83d9-4a88-880e-2aa49be4e31e-0
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:19.040
That fell into the water at some
point.

d0db08a5-8181-4d07-b711-96c13755bfc0-0
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.880
OK, now I'm seeing.

e76d6933-0c77-42be-b08f-d22df0193268-0
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.850
I guess we're over the water
now. Let's see, butterflies.

5f1f3848-875a-4db5-8eaf-8bb8ab242224-0
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:30.660
Umm.

039a0398-77d2-4e87-a0fa-495341999b94-0
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.500
Of fish and other fish.

d44245f4-a22d-4d8b-916b-6ef1abba9a1e-0
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.160
Snake.

90b21af5-d04e-4673-a0d9-029fc4b02c6f-0
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.100
A cat.

d536641d-b737-4a0e-9d2b-e0f868242385-0
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:41.640
The hat.

a422451b-c45a-45cf-b847-7c567743b795-0
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.390
And other fish. And over here
I'm seeing.

5bb398fc-36ca-42d8-9f45-8dceee6ddf3a-0
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.510
I think that's the moon bats.

6d4349e5-257f-46a2-a49a-169b9ba037ff-0
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.720
Elephant with extra long trunk.

0897ffd9-120f-4d28-bbdd-a1f4db40a5a9-0
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.980
Um.

1f165e0f-e236-4281-bcb1-32d33d46b792-0
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:03.937
Two of them. One looks like a
baby elephant. And then another

1f165e0f-e236-4281-bcb1-32d33d46b792-1
00:28:03.937 --> 00:28:05.350
seahorse or horse.

2a3356b4-0e13-464d-865d-7848e2e78aaa-0
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.890
And.

6737afe2-daf5-4ca1-b305-997fd9d18555-0
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.830
Leopard.

63ac280d-1bc4-406f-a224-264f5d407fbd-0
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.050
And that's it.

ca044d28-6ba3-45a9-a6c2-3154e202a2ea-0
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.523
OK, the boat hat, it's night
time now. I see the moon and

ca044d28-6ba3-45a9-a6c2-3154e202a2ea-1
00:28:22.523 --> 00:28:23.750
it's dark. So.

e95182cc-54cb-4e94-a244-0feebbf68375-0
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:30.871
With the the glow and the with
the glowy eye fish in the water,

e95182cc-54cb-4e94-a244-0feebbf68375-1
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:34.500
he's on top of the water and
stars in the sky.

d8e6d17b-2003-40ab-a315-993920d78293-0
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.490
Hmm.

cc53c5c3-c7e2-4b8a-af16-806334bce8ce-0
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.500
OK.

7fbb7ffb-e198-48ec-a475-ced69b875a73-0
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.050
OK, bunch of the glow

98c7b6d2-40b4-4820-b5d9-77c72cc00bf8-0
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.220
Fish and um, the hat is.

cfadb075-c505-42d9-8c07-fd089c7078dd-0
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.440
In the middle of all of that,
all of them.

2278f858-938f-48ba-aa2b-b47f61458aea-0
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.010
OK, and here I see.

b51b1391-7d10-41a5-bb14-7e6c2f59bc1a-0
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:05.830
Hmm.

a749b082-0335-4803-8341-ec451f426e89-0
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:11.350
Well, stars, it's still in night
time. I don't know what this is.

a749b082-0335-4803-8341-ec451f426e89-1
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.713
I don't know if it's raining,
but something is in the in the

a749b082-0335-4803-8341-ec451f426e89-2
00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:16.000
sky.

0e9179f2-5255-45fd-8f8c-c3ece349b407-0
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.370
And of course I see other fish
the boat had.

6b91f8c8-3c51-4b45-82f4-4420076ff7e7-0
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.660
And or hat, boat and more fish
in the water.

bc05fe50-7bde-4e82-9fda-1f4affb2f802-0
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.880
OK, this looks like an iceberg.

bb779daa-e94a-4ca6-bbc7-9cd335461659-0
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.960
The top of the iceberg.

8751af22-c1d9-4091-a12a-3fe992533003-0
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.810
And um.

5947d8e3-31a3-41b3-8eed-0b199504d7f8-0
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:43.330
The boat hat and the other side
is more of the iceberg.

f6c9b0d0-d7e7-4faa-a453-3a42d20a707b-0
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:53.812
OK, this looks like a cave and
the boat hat is going into the

f6c9b0d0-d7e7-4faa-a453-3a42d20a707b-1
00:29:53.812 --> 00:29:54.650
into it.

1c0dcfe4-a683-41ea-bc72-fff2468a0b2e-0
00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.670
And I know something's in the
sky. I don't know what that is.

3ecebc5c-83c3-4a1b-8340-4aee25851d4d-0
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.100
And on this side it's.

cef828d7-3082-4572-a3c5-64eeadb90783-0
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.900
Yeah, the the boat is still
continuing through this cave.

fecab4e6-50c0-495f-aa44-3cb2d3fcbe6e-0
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.390
OK, so then you get to.

2229c543-77e0-43aa-9153-f7d9a76cc087-0
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:21.930
Um.

0e280c4f-abaa-47e0-99aa-5186d22a7573-0
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.080
More icebergs I guess.

381dba27-fd3b-4b02-ac24-75b2a53bd1ef-0
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.570
And you see the, the, the, the
hat boat.

e053819e-d7d3-4d2f-aa8e-71d2da314a6f-0
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.250
And.

1b74d468-da90-43bf-ad8c-891b686fb26b-0
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.114
I don't know what this is. Looks
like some kind of vegetation

1b74d468-da90-43bf-ad8c-891b686fb26b-1
00:30:37.114 --> 00:30:40.200
coming up out the water. Then
over here you see.

08e31a8b-909b-45cd-b11e-6575cb9a9b28-0
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.810
Looks like a scuba diver.

cc6691cd-1e40-4651-93f4-aa8a5021b3ef-0
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.870
But judging from his hands, this
is a fish.

54d71024-095d-4f80-ac41-d8095d807476-0
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.280
And um.

d3e33578-8c6b-4b7d-996c-7e2c0c384022-0
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.150
There's a tentacles coming.

13b50dde-fb3c-42d3-89a0-4f3e06d97781-0
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.440
From these flowers.

6b9c38a7-3c3a-42bb-b80c-820f43725f60-0
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:00.980
And.

cd45e8f7-9aa0-4413-af83-838650455be9-0
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.790
Oh, and of course, the boat.

731d6df0-f2dc-4270-bafd-7e9aa42ac5bd-0
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.310
And um.

456c53b0-cfe1-4611-b17c-3cd29eb042f0-0
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.810
I don't know what this is, but
something write with the 05.

2d62fdd9-c504-4995-8761-646d1f247f5d-0
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.120
Oh yeah, OK. And another scuba
diver, I think.

bbd8980f-c2a8-4817-89d4-b09818e37078-0
00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.330
OK.

ab0c09a7-0c60-435a-9aa4-7c4c045ff37a-0
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.650
OK, we got the flower, the boat.

1d481889-e0c4-4cb6-88d5-760819f895a4-0
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:31.790
A big ship, luxury liner. Uh,
two of them.

41cc8289-4a66-4d24-981b-c6aa6ad59d09-0
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:38.590
And this one is either lowering
their Nets.

da515419-f84c-4c90-8dd5-0be7f85ce27e-0
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:44.447
Or pulling them out. So these
are fishing boats I take it. And

da515419-f84c-4c90-8dd5-0be7f85ce27e-1
00:31:44.447 --> 00:31:46.720
then of course more seagulls.

a23a6dd9-bb4c-4e1e-bf87-8ada46b25cb9-0
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.330
And trees.

f99df93b-0025-4e71-b6bb-e7e93b60b47a-0
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.550
OK, Birds, trees.

df490acc-774a-4f7c-b03a-e66d270a7210-0
00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:58.930
Water.

92315534-b710-4a1f-9854-311a80cfc8da-0
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.290
The boat.

7e77a633-7e4f-4c7e-8c5c-ac39738c28c9-0
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.120
And.

b864bbdc-2bb3-41f3-9792-2f01bcc56931-0
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.820
Hmm.

339cb37a-7bc8-4b68-b6ad-3ebe3e9ccf90-0
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.450
Uh.

d77c3442-7e87-4ed1-9e4e-9fa5afbc3b9c-0
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.670
This looks like a building.

bbbef44e-6bec-45b4-bd64-867973e87b6e-0
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.030
And and judging from the net.

86dfab3c-e994-44ce-8f6a-0eae9a308ae6-0
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.250
They are fishing.

da74cc7a-a7a9-40a2-9088-c7427302a5e1-0
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.833
Black stuff coming out of the
pipes of the boat or whatever

da74cc7a-a7a9-40a2-9088-c7427302a5e1-1
00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:21.430
this is.

cdb3e8cd-ea7f-46f5-bc98-763ec0cd933c-0
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.360
And more birds and water and
trees.

4e36b533-f87b-473e-a6a5-c71842633a57-0
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.260
OK, now you got men.

568d97ae-81b5-4c40-a7c7-e01286b7bd78-0
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.800
Looking out of the.

598d314d-4248-442e-a175-7bcbc0e67037-0
00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.010
Whatever these are, shooting at
the fish.

06e23116-7ab8-4e40-86c4-d8a8870dec90-0
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.410
OK, then I see an anchor.

6da20df5-4bc3-45ff-bc34-acc6e83c5a9f-0
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.070
Then here I see the moon.

8e8e4865-04cb-40f6-956f-29979d0d2505-0
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.540
I guess it's clouds.

808aee24-ce42-4ebc-b87f-131ffa57744c-0
00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.870
The scuba fish standing on.

f349ec60-c1ba-4892-8009-b3b8dc8fc1b3-0
00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:06.398
Looks like a submarine or fish
shaped like a submarine and then

f349ec60-c1ba-4892-8009-b3b8dc8fc1b3-1
00:33:06.398 --> 00:33:07.440
the the boat.

236eebc0-99f2-4f79-b8ab-84ffc5f13575-0
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.940
Umm.

78c77e8c-a03a-4df8-a697-7c8f66e281ad-0
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.460
OK, here trees.

85c63efa-bd47-4954-b6e4-fab6c8236a99-0
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.850
Uh, the scuba diver, the hat.

301dcb1c-8d44-460f-90cf-00fc0f699455-0
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.580
Water.

68b19489-ad2a-41e9-96fd-1c149162d602-0
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.170
Horses, spotted horses, or a
spotted horse.

32522511-6ea5-4de1-bec8-7cce8dcebd75-0
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.280
Um, on the submarine.

e403155e-7cc6-4bbc-8305-bdb5c3ccec1f-0
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.650
I see a cat.

0c2d6c7a-33c1-440b-b77b-21dea3b5e4c2-0
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:39.040
And this thing with one horn, I
don't know what that is.

a9e25f62-a6b1-4cc1-85d4-ec958cd1943d-0
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:44.920
OK, and a ant by the antlers. I
take it that's a deer.

a309accb-6cf3-4c47-b210-811f7f429523-0
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.970
OK.

2e00827b-5939-4c5a-8a09-67c11427746e-0
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.620
OK, here this is a wave.

1575fbbe-9665-49a9-9593-76ace0c0ccf6-0
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.860
And the hat is caught in the
wave.

d66a308b-b549-4fae-bf5d-b9e10b11fe7e-0
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.950
So.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.030
And over here I have.

8b7268f3-0256-45b9-948d-fa3ece75a220-0
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.080
a kite, torn kite.

b03a483b-5df6-4ee7-a53b-753e55c42744-0
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.170

945a1e0f-d67b-4847-ac62-c5aa4ca3e8c8-0
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:15.566
I guess trying to fix it, the
cat is bringing string to the to

945a1e0f-d67b-4847-ac62-c5aa4ca3e8c8-1
00:34:15.566 --> 00:34:18.670
the person. This horn guy is
here.

fb227e4d-4975-45b8-bd89-00f9cdd6f4d2-0
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:21.580
Horse.

0907d13f-3ed5-4845-8903-f988009b79dd-0
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.580
Scuba diver.

1d81ca06-2161-477b-aa76-88edb33d1099-0
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.115
And fish with the glowing eyes
and some other creatures I

1d81ca06-2161-477b-aa76-88edb33d1099-1
00:34:31.115 --> 00:34:34.400
can't. I don't know what they
what they're called.

5b78df15-63e0-4beb-8cb5-92745592d445-0
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.390
OK, started to storm because I
see lightning.

646dbd39-db3c-488b-9d7d-9e87a53d3eb0-0
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:47.640
Trees or clouds, water and the
boat.

462cabfa-8ced-4239-b3ab-3baf9d3cf351-0
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.720
And then I guess the.

b03be822-46e1-497b-b1b8-f6933b677637-0
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.890
Looks like the boat is flying or
being lifted with the air.

2fa9def4-41ef-470f-adce-a4b69cb4a78d-0
00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.620
And so, yeah.

16c36763-311f-455d-b6e9-f6668781823f-0
00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.780
More water.

2f4a4810-dc9b-4d2d-a05c-142944a52a86-0
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.750

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:19.787
I believe these are snakes and
then one of them picks up the

ca9ecada-99d4-4abf-8c6a-6e583b03f11a-1
00:35:19.787 --> 00:35:20.300

And I don't know what he's gonna
do with it. Then here the.

a9a2c498-c34a-49d0-9f79-f6fe118405f5-0
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.330
One of the snakes is and is.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.005
I don't know what he's doing,
but he's doing something and

abf45ea7-e9e2-4848-8e9c-751e1e298a3a-1
00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:39.740
then here you have the boat.

22aabc44-8423-424b-af91-1d7db0d9c96c-0
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.170
Umm.

7a6be9b3-72f6-496d-afba-5a76d8edb2ad-0

Some kind of fish.

c722a33f-1fdf-42f6-b377-7b57145e5dd6-0
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.480
And still in.

ea2c79b7-2152-4e0c-8337-96130ff52b35-0
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.160
Entwined with the snakes.

bb894df6-1569-48de-97d5-a9c3511ac189-0
00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.470
OK, now here you got the.

4308f2e2-3b98-444d-8eeb-3fd95df8f74a-0
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.120
Um.

4b99eefc-b1db-4fdb-a5ef-97d7c68beb28-0

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:16.910
Then there's the boat.

ac7ec4d3-b8f7-46d5-ad5e-cd438cfa2c88-0
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.380
And um.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.975
In the water, I think that's the
boat and I see this water, then

e75fd2ff-03d6-4366-8243-e543f4c28981-1
00:36:24.975 --> 00:36:26.810
I see these, this one creature.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.710
OK, here I see.

OK, these look like mushrooms.

79a66e17-eb2f-437c-a3c0-45facd912a04-0
00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.150

Mushrooms and some stripe thing.

c4b3c87a-9c7e-48dc-83da-b3f2a0c051f6-0
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.950
OK, the boat is.

Then there's oh, there's another
boat just like that one.

2d550ce5-0830-49a7-8f26-cc6e5c5a337b-0
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.360

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:52.528
On these 3, 3, 3 creatures, I

Because it has fins and a tail,
so.

bebd0d52-dfc6-4d24-8a54-44f96f36ec7d-0
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.920

The stack where the smoke comes
out.

29511b06-8d65-4d3a-b756-911cdd148d9e-0
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.570

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.546
And you see the fish underneath
it, you see the city off in the

5423b01b-3da7-4f1a-8575-b8d01328a81b-1
00:41:34.546 --> 00:41:35.170

I think I'm seeing two boats,
but I guess they're docked.

3e6a0b02-7f9e-450b-bf36-8e986b8e5efc-0
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:21.344
Because the people are standing
around, getting ready to get in

3e6a0b02-7f9e-450b-bf36-8e986b8e5efc-1
00:42:21.344 --> 00:42:24.430

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:35.460
Somebody walks up behind him.

b91f53c5-b7e7-40be-a8ba-b1a886721c1e-0
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.060
And offers some help I guess.

08f9bcd8-806e-4cd2-9088-a85e06d79c93-0
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:42.310
And then um.

52099aeb-0b33-46c6-aa24-d812c6f333e3-0
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.048
Now he has a suitcase in his
hand and he's walking around

52099aeb-0b33-46c6-aa24-d812c6f333e3-1
00:53:47.048 --> 00:53:48.100
crossing the street.

ba8eab82-f9d8-422c-ae62-f10eec348f02-0
00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:53.868
{Other people, the right and
left are two different. They're

ba8eab82-f9d8-422c-ae62-f10eec348f02-1
00:53:53.868 --> 00:53:54.560
2 pages.}

7bc4bdd2-1257-4734-a18f-932ad59a89d2-0
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:02.780
OK, OK. So OK, so goes back to
the clock.

fb39fbf6-6f28-4e2b-97ee-6123838e8df0-0
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.630
Then he now he's crossing the
street.

28bf010e-0c44-46ff-8e8c-e34c4a998ad1-0
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.250
And there's people walking
around.

edce992d-d45a-41e2-a1ac-c025293aa71c-0
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.260
Now he's still walking up the
street.

76a61cbb-4653-4f50-8ae1-9b6c01e4102d-0
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:23.469
Uh, looks like it's getting dark
while he still walks up the

76a61cbb-4653-4f50-8ae1-9b6c01e4102d-1
00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:24.000
street.

64ea05ce-76cc-4aa0-87ae-207b1daa638d-0
00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.630
And then,

e8c8b612-19ee-4e50-869f-d7d8e4b9fa64-0
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.710
Ohh OK Snow, maybe it's snowing.

85af7cfb-f621-4cd5-ada8-73ead16845c8-0
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.410
So he's looking up in the sky.

534d6e59-5192-400b-9158-c3ad03917b43-0
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.630
Then he goes to touch one of
them.

e81f603c-29da-49f6-abe3-51406af36ccf-0
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:41.080
Something blows his hat off.

1961eeac-7338-4f4e-8a71-1b9f360ad8d7-0
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.850
And um.

811fc36b-e0f8-4874-9a55-4d4543d1423f-0
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.180
Um, as he picks down and pick up
the hat. His hat.

ee7dcb7d-dfef-49c1-873a-c36f777b8f84-0
00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:53.390
Umm.

750bfd86-9396-4474-9d7f-ac4233f415b7-0
00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.810
I don't know. I can't see the
very bottom of the screen.

ee4daf9c-caf7-4097-979d-0513883a8518-0
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.430
So I don't know if he sees
something or what.

9e072a99-926e-4f78-8e6f-f2ada1cad2c1-0
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.550
But there's a map.

03f64cfa-d7d2-48bf-9c51-17165f672a9f-0
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.390
There's a map. OK, so.

7b9606fb-e5d0-44d1-918c-f08375100c93-0
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:17.459
While standing on the map, he he
takes out his book and he's

7b9606fb-e5d0-44d1-918c-f08375100c93-1
00:55:17.459 --> 00:55:18.850
reading the book.

6ea7559a-1563-49e9-a57f-f705b6582845-0
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.880
Some guy sticks his hand out.

0a8544b7-2720-4d62-a98a-61a805104ef7-0
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.980
To him, and then he starts to
talk to him.

ed10bd37-2e3e-4412-a13e-3618790a6963-0
00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.470
I guess he's trying to.

abbba7ad-46a4-421e-aea9-a9306817174a-0
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:38.975
Communicate with the guy, but he
doesn't speak the language, so

abbba7ad-46a4-421e-aea9-a9306817174a-1
00:55:38.975 --> 00:55:43.774
they're still talking, and then
he's pointing to what he's

abbba7ad-46a4-421e-aea9-a9306817174a-2
00:55:43.774 --> 00:55:44.750
looking for.

b723a19f-4e4f-4041-ab0f-05ae8de025ee-0
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.020
And that's when the man
understands.

4b0c0aae-4352-40ab-aa0a-ee5e08a4cbf3-0
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.530
Tell him somewhere to go.

d82e80db-5ee8-4219-97c1-aaac846e848a-0
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:56.569
And I guess offers to take him
there because he's walking with

d82e80db-5ee8-4219-97c1-aaac846e848a-1
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:59.670
some kind of animal in his
backpack.

2147ebeb-1895-465d-b5f6-65af728b4435-0
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.860
And the man is following.
#END_arrival_3

f5875b4b-0f9d-42b5-b060-e2070048fc53-0
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:08.579
OK, so that was this part of the
story. We'll go on to a complex

f5875b4b-0f9d-42b5-b060-e2070048fc53-1
00:56:08.579 --> 00:56:09.100
scene.

c1f18f9a-685a-4131-ba0e-dee4a61ef93c-0
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:13.550
OK.

81ce5ff9-22c6-453e-a820-484820ee4230-0
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.260
#START_picture_this OK, these
are.

236056bd-6d00-4ff6-8b45-6b2821ee3e7f-0
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:23.060
Framed portraits, so I see a.

570e51dd-8604-4e16-be54-dfa825d33e35-0
00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.510
A dragon.

bdd2b69c-841c-4ece-ad6b-51f0763aa670-0
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:29.720
Fish.

2738c4ff-cd8c-4557-b497-3c74a1143898-0
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:36.220
Uh, a man stepping on somebody
else's back.

084035b6-901c-427f-b612-11b560376ae5-0
00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.250
Umm.

2e579379-7090-4f3e-8bdb-310e8e00458b-0
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.090
Hmm, let me see.

8d911877-bbb6-43ad-a604-0bc26efb55db-0
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:48.230
Dog, I guess.

a03bd680-3d09-4688-84f4-ae2be198549f-0
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:50.530
Um.

3f0f9b04-cc25-4e9c-bfc0-2cc0a87efffe-0
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:53.470
I don't know what that is. Two
people.

be129b17-b25b-4efd-bba7-e8dce121d2ff-0
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:55.750
Umm.

3bb6457f-dcc9-47fd-87fa-57a0e7c09b50-0
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.626
And I see a picture of two guy
or some people laying down while

3bb6457f-dcc9-47fd-87fa-57a0e7c09b50-1
00:57:01.626 --> 00:57:04.260
another guy's throwing water on
them.

50c7be37-7480-4960-96fd-2a46fcbd6140-0
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:06.350
Um.

2e556224-e258-481f-9e65-5478f3845953-0
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:10.030
Two people wearing a hat.

4f1dea71-9e3f-43a1-8ff5-8b873c30fb81-0
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:13.720
That connects to each other.

8bbd1ddc-b058-4453-92c6-cba81c598a8c-0
00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.250
Umm.

23b15e95-624c-4bd9-a7cb-31574651acad-0
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.160
A bear's talking to somebody.

983a9d1e-ec26-4c2e-8355-ec027f9ad85d-0
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:24.030
Uh.

809f5543-72a0-4431-8c95-3917fd657256-0
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.680
A cowboy.

7ac49c65-c84c-4022-b2c6-de13ed7a993e-0
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:31.020
A man with a grass skirt.

372876b4-3db1-40e1-a653-b4419ae76742-0
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.450
Another man carrying something
and stepped on somebody.

108e7518-e5df-4a19-b188-064a976bffc7-0
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.030
Umm.

Um, OK, a clown.

cd25ef89-d436-4dbb-96b1-1fc364e6692f-0
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:53.960

Two people walking and I see
pictures of just.

881715a0-1b1a-4c54-a9fa-e552d9916c9a-0
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:04.051
Somebody's head, then here's a
full body picture, full body

881715a0-1b1a-4c54-a9fa-e552d9916c9a-1
00:58:04.051 --> 00:58:04.650
picture.

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.450
This is like somebody's
grandmother.

08bacfbf-f487-40da-ae06-7972ded1e1c3-0
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.430
Picture they're all pictures.

0b4cc157-37f7-465d-a283-a4ebc8a80b15-0
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:15.080
This is a snowball. This one
looks like a a man.

d0f1f32b-6526-4046-b99a-f3d028938a26-0
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.520
Who got rolled up into a
snowball.

eb8174f6-0272-4d83-9533-1b12808aa8f5-0
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:20.650

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:29.192
Then you got one green person
and one red, but they look like

6e32b3ac-c87b-4641-90e1-54eda5175dc3-1
00:58:29.192 --> 00:58:33.620
they were in costumes, two
people. This person is.

1c1ee58d-2eef-4bc4-98b8-e1dd6ccc46c4-0
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.745
Ohh, one guy's leaning backwards
and the other one's leaning

1c1ee58d-2eef-4bc4-98b8-e1dd6ccc46c4-1
00:58:38.745 --> 00:58:39.200
forward.

35ba22c2-f672-4b59-b213-dc64cfbe17bd-0
00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.430
Then I see a cat, a camel.

77945e74-5441-4cc5-883d-c13f1f532a53-0
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:47.030
Um, somebody pushes somebody in
a wagon.

0c71cc25-9786-445c-9220-1a3407354be9-0
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.870
Or wheelbarrow, or whatever that
is.

90500f3c-b00c-4c5f-b90b-5d8ab30f6670-0
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.090
And um.

4e937dcb-373e-41e7-acea-693e2aff9946-0
00:58:54.710 --> 00:59:00.678
I see a man and a woman with a
like a caveman's outfit.

4e937dcb-373e-41e7-acea-693e2aff9946-1
00:59:00.678 --> 00:59:02.170
Two-head fish.

b1d95969-7202-4461-b9b9-9cd0c3828bc8-0
00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.120
Uh.

8e5b9f51-6a2b-42b9-815a-597f432685ab-0
00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:09.840
These two people dancing and
singing.

c7738978-d709-4bef-a341-2080980549fe-0
00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:16.661
Then I see somebody who sees the
skeleton of dinosaur and gets

c7738978-d709-4bef-a341-2080980549fe-1
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:17.280
scared.

e102e15f-f2b7-402b-9910-fbf159c49121-0
00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:25.089

00:59:25.089 --> 00:59:27.400
backpack and a giraffe.

b841e385-d44f-4552-8b2a-8b21fa65b291-0

I don't know, like one of those
old general hats.

096d6cc6-10f7-4a3d-98e8-2527674758a5-0
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:45.530
What else?

1ea7d8e1-edb5-4e0f-b2d6-41cbf987ebbb-0
00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.520
Somebody's hand with some.

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:52.860
Writing on it, I guess on each
finger.

6cd312b6-5306-4d41-b8b6-68b18313799e-0
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.240

against a tree.

816ba320-6057-4394-b4a8-61884944e46f-0
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:09.540

another dragon.

802082a5-fa68-44ca-8242-19d8edb9a526-0
01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.330
Looking at some man.

f468cff4-e4fc-4f02-8936-129a68f7330c-0
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.920
Hmm.

193ee182-2ae0-44f6-8b16-eca5ee8204f7-0
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.300
I don't know, 2 gladiators.

950645cc-8873-428f-8094-f8e0c8a0c1f3-0
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:23.780
Uh.

22ab62f8-3716-43e1-9f63-ee5ca903e492-0
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.450
A guy with big muscular legs.

50a6b9a0-bb78-461f-a09f-79a869b5d3e4-0
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:30.970
And.

4c3040ab-b998-46cc-a9f2-ce8898766ef1-0
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:36.759
Oh, three mus, not three
musketeers. Look like they're

4c3040ab-b998-46cc-a9f2-ce8898766ef1-1
01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:37.780
three stooges.

57afc1c9-786f-4c9f-a435-3fcf2125b071-0
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.060
Um.

51080901-206c-4236-9af7-254c2419cae6-0
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.654
That's all I can think of. I
mean, that's all, you know.

51080901-206c-4236-9af7-254c2419cae6-1
01:00:45.654 --> 01:00:46.330
#END_picture_this

87504fff-aeb4-42f2-9495-7b170dcdadac-0
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:48.470
That was good.

66f7af98-74a9-492d-9b75-ab8839e2a938-0
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:53.240
So next we have another complex
scene.

3becbcac-b925-41fe-9fcf-971b06e30fa3-0
01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:58.490
OK.

166be2cc-6bee-4118-8fe9-ee207307471c-0
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.070
#START_unfriendly_giants OK,
these are giants.

049f6303-9aaa-44fa-974b-e47762e74402-0
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.940
And OK, I see a

7041e9da-970e-4b50-be75-005aacb9aff9-0
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:08.130
A castle.

85a818ea-0050-47e5-abfc-0c7ffdb180d8-0
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.280
One guy, I think he's drunk.

262730e3-b3f3-4708-8bb9-48084cf41130-0
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:15.910
Ohh.

30920280-7547-46c1-8119-7748649433a7-0
01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.930
And um.

13791a9e-5f6d-4b79-b982-8e33eaf0ec9b-0
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:24.861
Back in the back, it looks like
some guy just cut down a tree. I

13791a9e-5f6d-4b79-b982-8e33eaf0ec9b-1
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:25.970
see a windmill.

8ed8ccb6-3d74-4c6d-b325-61b36c141846-0
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.100
Another guy with striped
stockings on.

6d63f9ab-20c7-488f-8721-26559bb1a44a-0
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.570
Another windmill in the back.

2220d655-20ac-48fd-89ef-8b061b22bd01-0
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.290
Umm.

18ec3d53-bc1e-4b65-92c8-6ea7b962d97c-0
01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:42.790
OK, another guy carrying a tree.

7315da7a-0903-406c-b30d-c02dbbbbd4b3-0
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:49.963
Then I see a guy with flowers
trying to give it to some woman,

7315da7a-0903-406c-b30d-c02dbbbbd4b3-1
01:01:49.963 --> 01:01:52.280
but I don't think she's real.

11d2820f-343c-401b-9588-71f666717f04-0
01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:00.442
And then over here is another
guy trying to give, uh trying to

11d2820f-343c-401b-9588-71f666717f04-1
01:02:00.442 --> 01:02:02.370
kiss an unreal woman.

f06bab86-68ae-4cda-8d19-bab9039fda83-0
01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:04.710
And.

8518815c-e1a2-45c0-b0ae-1fe2b7f079a7-0
01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.100
And then you have a giant with
people in his belt.

f7fa3995-afeb-41aa-b82e-2f83a187cc10-0
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:12.260
Umm.

190c06ad-e316-4c1e-9d28-4846a18a065a-0
01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:18.080
And normal size people, I guess
trying to go in the house or

190c06ad-e316-4c1e-9d28-4846a18a065a-1
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.850
standing around the house.

f5a9617b-2ef3-410e-8614-63d9482952a1-0
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.220
And um.

b3780549-27e4-4957-b848-f2b88cf5b597-0
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:30.640
Then you got people drinking
from straws while another person

b3780549-27e4-4957-b848-f2b88cf5b597-1
01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.840
behind them is singing, looks
like.

137be78c-8649-4d66-971b-853a69d33457-0
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:36.960
And.

10b1caa3-11e6-455c-8c23-09ab7fcdf19c-0
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.730
Regular sized people standing on
some kind of.

016324c8-f373-4e00-a1ba-a04bfc0c69ea-0
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.248
A tall thing, getting ready to
hit him in the head with a

016324c8-f373-4e00-a1ba-a04bfc0c69ea-1
01:02:46.248 --> 01:02:46.740
mallet.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.100


c2fc397b-b854-4bab-a76f-9b8c3bcccf2e-0
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.280
A man, I don't know if he's mad,
looks mad.

b2d9e674-cfa7-4d67-a444-5d1fd43b7eb6-0
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.460
And then there's another guy
that looks puzzled.

67a1b39f-a227-4464-937a-95f2fa5ede87-0
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:03.880
And then you got some regular
sized people.

601c8068-c943-4366-9479-433a383dcc07-0
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:06.060
And houses.

3b853635-665b-4e6f-bd69-443b79dffb7a-0
01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:08.320
And.

b300c9af-ab38-4ba6-82a6-2fe4ab9e0f45-0
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:12.890
A man with.

4565d1e9-2c44-4613-969e-0bde5aba93d4-0
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:14.460
Hmm.

7fff1ee0-1376-4b1c-8a28-50ec7cd41576-0
01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:18.920
I don't know if this is.

d91c01b1-c1dc-4a9a-be4e-ea122a902dea-0
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.940
Well, people.

6be6ca9f-4405-4ef0-85f2-4b4fd9fe268e-0
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.940
Trying to give one to the other
guy.

6ed3a129-c120-49cc-a518-be2de6e15e51-0
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:31.183
Ohh, a chess board. That's what
they are. They're playing chess,

6ed3a129-c120-49cc-a518-be2de6e15e51-1
01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:31.900
but with.

90ee8c3b-cf87-402a-9bf8-f0ba1211e702-0
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:37.160
The pieces are shaped like
people, OK.

2544dc45-53f8-4d77-aff1-1316664deade-0
01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.010
Yeah, well, the other guy's
looking.

b044d17e-3af3-4c45-85de-687a9e2d2602-0
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:43.520
And.

95104671-83b1-4cc3-8f05-9159083b10d3-0
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.840
That's pretty much it.

9254afdf-cbd8-4efe-ae05-c31e782c7f7c-0
01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:54.628
So moving on to the next one,
we've got a story that is about

9254afdf-cbd8-4efe-ae05-c31e782c7f7c-1

#START_arrival_6 OK, I see a a
vase.

fd8cd928-99f0-4384-acd3-1be7792de3da-0
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.090
And now I see a bird.

258106fa-5d4b-417d-af6e-9cd0949e7024-0
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.140
Carrying something to it.

01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:10.060
And.

8eef8913-1965-4e3a-bae7-59177d157f01-0
01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:17.296
Here, he's putting whatever he's
carrying in the vase in the

8eef8913-1965-4e3a-bae7-59177d157f01-1
01:04:17.296 --> 01:04:17.740
vase.

40fe360d-69b9-4973-bf19-481ddbaeeabd-0
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:24.503
Then this guy's walking down.
{Oops, oops, I forgot. That's a

40fe360d-69b9-4973-bf19-481ddbaeeabd-1
01:04:24.503 --> 01:04:30.586
that's it's page. Page. OK, OK
and} OK, here. He's sitting at

40fe360d-69b9-4973-bf19-481ddbaeeabd-2
01:04:30.586 --> 01:04:31.469
his desk.

2933d77c-923f-4b51-8a37-9cd89b93461a-0
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:38.813
Um, with the vase right there
writing something and I see a

2933d77c-923f-4b51-8a37-9cd89b93461a-1
01:04:38.813 --> 01:04:39.250
lamp.

ce2ae050-82c9-4022-ab14-81cb279e8a8b-0
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.260
Then he now he's in the process
of writing something and I think

ce2ae050-82c9-4022-ab14-81cb279e8a8b-1
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.140
that's money on the table.

9a979840-12ba-4cd2-ae85-7c9a12bdba0b-0
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.730
Now he's folding up the.

3f845af6-35a2-4768-907c-4e76d286e8c6-0
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:55.700
The piece of paper he just wrote
something on.

18d4c0b0-07a0-4f9d-8aec-87c5269b46ee-0
01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:01.944
And and shaping it into a bird.
Then he puts it in an envelope

18d4c0b0-07a0-4f9d-8aec-87c5269b46ee-1
01:05:01.944 --> 01:05:03.260
with the money.

d27aafec-a45d-4264-aa04-2a90d9805b26-0
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.310
Seals it and puts the stamp on
it.

c28dbfeb-6d7d-4788-9a1f-337c250c2394-0
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.610
Now he's walking down.

b2aa9bb9-ed8e-4cfb-a7ba-21728c921cd8-0
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:16.183
To the mailbox I take it, with
with his pet, whatever that is

b2aa9bb9-ed8e-4cfb-a7ba-21728c921cd8-1
01:05:16.183 --> 01:05:16.540
and.

d272104c-f191-4873-8e19-ed4b080972c3-0
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.886
Oh, he's. I guess he's asking
this woman where's the nearest

d272104c-f191-4873-8e19-ed4b080972c3-1
01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:23.360
mailbox?

0d4b2417-84d6-4df8-87e7-de7f0a2e74d4-0
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:26.490
And so he finds it.

05eb9f51-43e2-4dd8-835e-70f3c0790477-0
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:32.900
And now he's reading the sign on
the mailbox. Then he drops it

05eb9f51-43e2-4dd8-835e-70f3c0790477-1
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.280
into the mailbox.

e42ad762-eacb-486e-b29e-9ff24e30412c-0
01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:37.980
And looks up.

90de4674-4a88-475d-8506-bba77aae0dc5-0
01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.550
And then here he.

0e7a67d4-2ac9-4cc9-be2d-112eb24a2beb-0
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.990
The mailbox takes off.

8a06736e-0269-4d12-84fc-6f3f97593a6a-0
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:53.511
With a balloon and I see the
leaves all around and this man

8a06736e-0269-4d12-84fc-6f3f97593a6a-1
01:05:53.511 --> 01:05:59.150
and his pet. I guess they're
walking back to the room.

e260b5ac-a7f5-456a-8556-85784b278ec8-0
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.390
OK, so now I see a leaf.

f62f6988-882a-4afe-b44c-58a94fc49f4b-0
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:11.501
And here it looks to be raining,
and the leaf is torn in the

f62f6988-882a-4afe-b44c-58a94fc49f4b-1
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:16.800
middle. And this. And now it's
torn even. Oh, wait, no.

27093067-c886-4991-ad07-2ef3ad737fbc-0
01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.411
{There's a cross. Ohh OK} now
it's pouring even more with the

27093067-c886-4991-ad07-2ef3ad737fbc-1
01:06:23.411 --> 01:06:26.450
with the little thing in the
middle.

7f904e2c-047c-48ef-bf2c-53c9ed3d77d4-0
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:33.470
Now it's uh has started, the
ends are curled up, and the.

891688a4-b2e1-4b94-9af1-9ebc6e008731-0
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:37.710
Thing that's that was in the
middle was standing up straight.

0984a36a-d22d-4837-b1ca-a7d7e1dc06f8-0
01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.130
And or straightening up. Now
it's standing up straight.

8873c618-3ad3-47b7-b3cd-3c52bc012dc4-0
01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:44.610
And.

f1eae623-1955-4e9e-bb72-ebe1b2329757-0
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:49.544
Looks like the leaves are about
to wither and that thing is

f1eae623-1955-4e9e-bb72-ebe1b2329757-1
01:06:49.544 --> 01:06:53.180
turning into something. So now
the leaves fall off.

576344d3-35e7-41a7-9a55-3bf7bffa54f4-0
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.500
With the flower left on it.

04166242-187f-49ef-884a-460084818a52-0
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.920
Um.

a468dc82-231e-42bc-84a4-f892a9db1f99-0
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.390
Now now, looks like the leaves
have.

e001425b-e163-4451-88e3-e223204e4098-0
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.820
Disintegrated altogether and the
flower's growing more.

a61d1597-ac42-4b7d-890e-fb78c3315678-0
01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:15.210
Now you or tree, now you have
birds flying around it.

e9694a5b-4510-49dc-81cf-73cf5b871896-0
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.090
And.

a56eaba5-1d6f-4b48-b6d5-e0e82e8f9394-0
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.310
Looks like it's blown to.

3de9f1a1-0a97-4ade-b492-7abf7625f002-0
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:30.530
Capacity and now this one. The
wind comes along, blows all the.

1f67bf30-9177-416c-b012-b0a31a1dd88b-0
01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:35.460
The fur, the leaves or furry
things, whatever those are.

768da4ee-de7c-4b65-b473-8359239e3457-0
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:42.570
And this is it. Um, I'm assuming
that seasons are changing, so.

e91eb199-5662-438f-969c-d0268755df94-0
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.410
So this thing is.

c92ed135-474d-4400-962b-b19296a63f16-0
01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.750
Is um.

860a6409-788f-4d7e-8102-d220bd8e56a2-0
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:52.468
Hmm. The leaf, I mean, yeah,
it's it's getting ready to

860a6409-788f-4d7e-8102-d220bd8e56a2-1
01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.050
things are falling off. So here.

20e36e8c-0aab-4f1e-afb1-985d6331fc44-0
01:07:57.090 --> 01:08:02.170
You have something that's
growing on each individual.

40037357-ec03-4fb3-bbcd-8f2e3e0ab04a-0
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.980
Whatever that is.

cefd0050-b30a-4c4d-b6c8-b05510cf1974-0
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:08.500
And now birds are coming around.

ff9063e2-873d-4541-8168-5b7df5dc043d-0
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.742
Looked like some type of seeds.
Here the seeds look like they

ff9063e2-873d-4541-8168-5b7df5dc043d-1
01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:15.060
are.

3b588383-2256-40d2-bae1-4094c09dd678-0
01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.690
Fully grown, then they fall off
ground.

ca4da888-df66-4277-8789-ed9f301a7c72-0
01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.950
And then animals can eat it.

f7139761-8b2a-454c-9ec9-aa8018be622b-0
01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:30.262
Now it's getting ready to die,
looks like. And here it's dying

f7139761-8b2a-454c-9ec9-aa8018be622b-1
01:08:30.262 --> 01:08:35.750
more, and here it's the flower
itself is starting to.

9c6aa3d2-143e-4e81-a00a-bade53d05fbf-0
01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:40.630
Disintegrate and then here even
more so.

78060766-5c6d-4d40-b6ed-53bcb9cfdc50-0
01:08:42.150 --> 01:08:44.340
And eventually.

35fb71e3-a81e-4a32-abf9-565ed3f82527-0
01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:48.650
All the green stuff has come
off.

93e3edca-a7e5-43a1-b096-a4bed604860c-0
01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:55.310
But the the outline of it is
still there and then here.

1c609793-00ba-48c0-aeed-36c168055467-0
01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:00.051
I don't know. It's snowing, I
guess. Oh yeah, the first it's

1c609793-00ba-48c0-aeed-36c168055467-1
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.450
started to snow. OK, now it's
snowing.

5e6ecd98-2b58-4b62-b41c-6b98c5474b28-0
01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:04.400
OK.

cc452558-16d3-4f51-85d1-996b3f9a6622-0
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:14.220
OK, I see a building with a lot
of windows.

1a366dc8-59ae-4124-8190-fd546f73e593-0
01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:16.210
Umm.

455e81d0-d4be-410b-b138-645f8cb16bb7-0
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.870
That looks like a boat with the
stacks.

8139cf43-bafb-45e2-84d1-12b53ed1b0f1-0
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:21.880
Or boat?

9129e695-debb-46e9-9ff1-2e9defb1d335-0
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.530
I guess that's a boat, yeah.

294382a8-cf77-49b8-b808-725f0b2b3abc-0
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:26.500
And um.

c505068b-c964-430b-b820-d4e5403e0078-0
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.670
Another building.

944b58d4-42c1-40a9-bfd0-d3e69661098e-0
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.600
Umm.

7a79a851-3642-441e-b642-e5f76caaaf54-0
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.180
On the ground I see people
walking around.

79bf8da0-136c-4c17-bf83-4f6fefec2b40-0
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.250
And.

b1b4467c-ea5a-44b1-a61d-fea2d80b2642-0
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.298
On this side I see buildings,
different shapes inside and and

b1b4467c-ea5a-44b1-a61d-fea2d80b2642-1
01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:48.930
heights.

4cd07421-5c6e-4f47-a253-57a870162a8a-0
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:51.330
And um.

02660d6f-e42c-484c-a105-982f077873ff-0
01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:55.200
On the ground I see.

84c5c413-0073-4f1e-b268-2bad40e216fb-0
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.140
Hmm, something ohh those flowers
that we just saw.

5997f2c4-6822-4bf6-a410-9b9289426b82-0
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:05.320
Hmm.

2fed3fd0-a7c2-4655-9c83-6756ef670580-0
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.280
And yeah, OK, OK, I'm finished.

807bcbe2-bbde-4453-b958-922725c12eb0-0
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:14.390
Then here we have a vase.

23ecba04-73df-4b2e-960c-a5bd800b3adc-0
01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.490
Where and and this.

3d99df3d-0c80-4cc9-8178-499809ff8d4f-0
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:20.480
Uh.

3e4fffb3-e57e-45d5-948f-7da4c3cfa6e4-0
01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:23.440
Flying object, whatever that is.

f79e3e47-6d37-4159-843a-35080d639084-0
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.230
Is um.

d3c9c017-ec64-4397-9e51-140df53d1574-0
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.938
Ohh birds, baby birds. He's
bringing, she's bringing

d3c9c017-ec64-4397-9e51-140df53d1574-1
01:10:31.938 --> 01:10:33.890
something to feed them.

2a283e3d-4e1a-4e9c-bc68-9f77ac54d999-0
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.030
OK, so now in this in the big
picture.

66633fb4-af6c-479a-9772-ccc3e9c4ce8b-0
01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:44.262
You have the guy looking at his,
his the picture of his family.

66633fb4-af6c-479a-9772-ccc3e9c4ce8b-1
01:10:44.262 --> 01:10:47.800
I'm going to take it he misses
them and.

f469a2cb-c83c-47ab-8d4c-3faac6f1dd66-0
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:51.780
Papers on the wall.

8cd95044-2dc1-43c7-8e09-c01d542fa76c-0
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:57.480
His coat or something hanging
up, socks.

8c6c795f-b9df-4e42-88c7-773d7c7b4748-0
01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:00.260
Um.

355f5f18-e13b-4d32-b527-0643e2d7ee0d-0
01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.380
I see a bookcase, a desk and
chairs, his slippers.

342e00da-cc37-439b-ae1b-f6e762532ec2-0
01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:13.039
I don't know what this is on the
floor. It's like some kind of

342e00da-cc37-439b-ae1b-f6e762532ec2-1
01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:15.300
dish, a lamp on the table,
books.

c4f4bdd8-5b2c-41ec-84b1-7143f662c32b-0
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:21.550
And here I see that his little
pet, whatever it's called.

14db244d-963d-413d-aca0-319f02a3fcc3-0
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.070
And he's asleep. He wakes up.

76a8b70b-c8bb-4192-88bc-e9a8bb65140d-0
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:29.220
Then he jumps down off of
whatever he was on.

e0a718e0-562a-4b02-90cd-2fef860511d2-0
01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.134
And so now the man is looking,
wondering where he's running to.

e0a718e0-562a-4b02-90cd-2fef860511d2-1
01:11:36.134 --> 01:11:40.988
He ran down the ladder. So the
man went down the ladder to see.

e0a718e0-562a-4b02-90cd-2fef860511d2-2
01:11:40.988 --> 01:11:42.960
And here it was. A letter.

331f83d0-da54-41f1-a69c-1d811d967cf1-0
01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.510
Yep. So he picks up the letter.

315bfde9-507b-4e34-8af1-941f3039cb1b-0
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.450
Opens it up.

800cd9f9-0c50-4083-b57f-bb72ad26d9d6-0
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:51.200
Reads it.

0a3fff55-9067-4a62-971f-2cb999d2fef9-0
01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:57.357
And now he's happy because
whoever he wrote to responded to

0a3fff55-9067-4a62-971f-2cb999d2fef9-1
01:11:57.357 --> 01:11:58.170
him. Hmm.

c4dffab0-a005-4fa9-b6ff-d4315f329374-0
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:04.540
OK, now you got another paper.

c0dfa92e-44b0-4c82-ae10-03261cb8f6cd-0
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:05.990
Ornament.

a836af40-ac86-4cbb-b4fa-6fc778503b08-0
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.210
Um.

31aa34a1-0b7b-48b3-a34f-0f06f4e9a710-0
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:10.590
Here.

82b6ce1f-04ff-4350-98f8-0e4b22fd8e79-0
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.985
I don't know what this is. Look
like dishes, but then it also

82b6ce1f-04ff-4350-98f8-0e4b22fd8e79-1
01:12:16.985 --> 01:12:21.217
looks like a like maybe a
furnace or something. Anyway,

82b6ce1f-04ff-4350-98f8-0e4b22fd8e79-2
01:12:21.217 --> 01:12:22.200
hat and coat.

6145cd1d-357e-4894-ba8c-8a6fe04f4fcf-0
01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.990
And a bowl full of something.

569d98e5-3a48-4313-8504-c654fb7d3735-0
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.900
And a picture, a drawing of a
boat.

1e4502f5-ab6c-4933-96cd-1fc886e1e171-0
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.610
And something else.

be0b2179-90c4-414f-a81a-0f05ce2f9795-0
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:43.890
And a child's drawing. OK, and
then this thing is.

e7c01706-bf0e-4bb8-a5c1-282f19c3615f-0
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:46.700
I don't know what this is.

c8b48106-3128-47bb-a935-d84b9185b043-0
01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:52.217
Anyway, then a cup of coffee.
Maybe that's a coffee grinder,

c8b48106-3128-47bb-a935-d84b9185b043-1
01:12:52.217 --> 01:12:55.905
coffee maker or something. Then
he pours himself a cup of

c8b48106-3128-47bb-a935-d84b9185b043-2
01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:56.350
coffee.

3fe463a0-c5d7-4c5a-bc3c-420b8bd6173c-0
01:12:57.730 --> 01:13:02.330
The picture of him and his wife
and kids and then he gives.

8ba26ed9-608b-4173-bf49-021e09ea609a-0
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:04.010
Somebody.

483fe742-037f-42f4-96a0-6fca9c106a9f-0
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:10.016
Looks like a pocket watch. It
looks like I I see numbers, a

483fe742-037f-42f4-96a0-6fca9c106a9f-1
01:13:10.016 --> 01:13:11.240

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.440
Hmm.

e8093067-4efe-4039-b5ab-ab09f861a527-0
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.050
OK, here is him and his wife and
kid.

56b66b9f-f34e-401e-a66e-8af070f8001a-0
01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.270
Sitting at the table eating. OK
Oh yeah, he's handing that to

56b66b9f-f34e-401e-a66e-8af070f8001a-1
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.530
her.

01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:28.640
So and then the pet.

06c1f288-81d5-4bed-8373-64e29a0aa5e4-0
01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:34.338
So I take that mean that he's
back home and then somebody's

06c1f288-81d5-4bed-8373-64e29a0aa5e4-1
01:13:34.338 --> 01:13:37.160
putting on their boots, the
girl.

54506645-2612-4b85-a10e-610fd2303b05-0
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.660
She reaches down and gets her
hat from this pet.

60a96fea-8c68-43d7-a155-003148659f56-0
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:44.320
Puts it on.

14aba13a-bb30-4b3d-a65a-faa0d1488b90-0
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.770
Um runs off the house.

fa3d51eb-7750-45ed-9b4d-398bb16664bc-0
01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.400
Runs down the steps.

7f5713e7-9e1e-4cec-9d1e-9566102fd93b-0
01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.950
And she's pointing at something.

48ffef4f-f887-4065-afee-1770eda96f1c-0
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:59.747
And now she's trying to touch
something. Something in the air.

48ffef4f-f887-4065-afee-1770eda96f1c-1
01:13:59.747 --> 01:14:00.520

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.670
OK, that was this part of the
story.

0ba8eb82-024e-4976-9277-3ab09583869a-0
01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.250
OK, um.

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:12.586
Give me a few minutes cause you
finish the items that I put

db2ad8b0-4c98-4fa8-a600-ec64c0f004b5-1
01:14:12.586 --> 01:14:17.349

minutes, I'll put the rest of

01:14:17.349 --> 01:14:18.710
them together, OK?

0e6340b9-abe8-4fc0-97a6-aeae92cbc217-0
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:25.600

scene.

87496f58-8d09-48c8-8742-786d0f59e6d8-0
01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:33.540

clothes, some of them aren't.

0e9ff349-506f-4e06-92fc-75e6cbc22cbb-0
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:56.010
I see an elephant.

ae6efde3-384b-4dfa-91b9-1a6097c4ce14-0
01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.660

01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:20.920
And then I see people on this
ground.

8197056f-a407-4520-b57a-e3d50e46bc3f-0
01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.570
In the grass, laying on
blankets.

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:28.600
And some people are standing
around looking.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.560
Somebody has one of those big
super soakers.

01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:36.650
They're shooting water at some
guy.

01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:42.480

01:15:52.020 --> 01:16:00.274
And then here I see a big giant
slide that that ends in the

522c4efc-f1bc-4c93-bbe0-0ff72067f405-1
01:16:00.274 --> 01:16:02.200
water. A boat.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.500

A dragon I guess, blow up thing
where water is coming out of its

743160ea-3c02-4b08-89ff-5cefbdaaabda-1
01:16:16.185 --> 01:16:16.830

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.720
Then you have people.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:24.480
Grown people. Uh, standing
around in the water talking.

01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:28.330
Then I see some bushes.

47ab8a17-13cb-4be6-9e18-498412cbc87c-0
01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.690

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:51.320
Looks like a snake, toy snake
with the kids riding it.

f48bb564-d94d-4689-badb-cab75b4f5fcc-0
01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:56.110

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:28.980
I see a car that ran off the
embankment there.

265a8c1c-2ffb-424b-9353-0c6095f103b9-0
01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.705
I'm assuming she was in it, so
she got out, little old lady,

265a8c1c-2ffb-424b-9353-0c6095f103b9-1
01:17:34.705 --> 01:17:39.160

bridge. I see a bridge, I see

01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:28.327
Her and her cat or dog, whatever

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:21.544
In the back of this House you
have somebody standing on the

9a465549-e90c-414d-b983-93cd624a8be7-1

And that's it. Ohh, the guy has
a flower too.

So that was the story. OK, and
then we'll finish up with a

7dc51f7f-513e-40bc-b909-b295fdcab8cb-1
01:33:24.824 --> 01:33:25.960
complex scene.

dc8d451b-b67a-4f31-ba69-7ba8d4a2c429-0

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:39.310
Looks like a airport or
something, so you got.

6f66c58c-bbc8-45c9-9817-fddc5474ea43-0
01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:42.040

01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:48.190
Airplanes up top.

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:51.420
With a blimp up top.

f4b78b75-7ef6-4d7e-9e12-f22f1bcb3ad5-0
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:56.110

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.560
Something is on the flagpole.

c1a056e5-f45c-4ca0-96ff-4112c8547b26-0
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:09.980
And four I see people, oh, I see
animals going into a airplane.

baaa48f4-efc9-4608-aade-a310de27bfd7-0
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:16.650
And then I see a US flag and a
UK flag.

68f9556f-f778-4ebf-97f3-1caf6c1ba7d4-0
01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.327
And all kinds of flags on the
world, I don't know what those

68f9556f-f778-4ebf-97f3-1caf6c1ba7d4-1
01:34:24.327 --> 01:34:26.660
are. But then a hot air balloon.

121420d1-a6a5-405f-a275-2f33aa4a74a4-0
01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:29.040
Um.

That has that the top is out, so
you can.

f5d768bf-9033-4387-94dd-5bd51a92c9c9-0
01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:43.001
Look out. Or or maybe it's a
pickup truck or any something,

f5d768bf-9033-4387-94dd-5bd51a92c9c9-1
01:34:43.001 --> 01:34:47.487
but this man is falling out of
it. Then I see a plane with the

f5d768bf-9033-4387-94dd-5bd51a92c9c9-2
01:34:47.487 --> 01:34:48.840
ace of spade on it.

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.770
Then I see a lot of people with
blue on.

01:35:00.670 --> 01:35:03.760
And I see some guy driving.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.069
A like a big giant wagon with
some animals in it and one guy

8cbde0f9-16a5-4a21-97a3-224cb26bb15e-1
01:35:10.069 --> 01:35:11.510

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:16.658
And then inside the airport I
see people standing there

2a385bf5-0ce1-44b0-a754-4a14c2163f26-1
01:35:16.658 --> 01:35:18.520

01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:22.220
Or buying tickets at the ticket
desk.

12adccc1-5590-4fb3-a0ee-7d524b190f7b-0
01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.070

01:35:33.298 --> 01:35:33.470
it.

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:42.250
Truck that carries the luggage
from one place to another.

38e21bab-76c7-44ff-8f38-e9386ce8de28-0
01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.940
And a forklift.

5029f044-e5bd-458b-bca0-e6fcdd3ff41f-0
01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.750
Yeah.

612169af-0e63-43d8-a914-4e5f7ce01167-0

51b61e05-6f3d-4ae5-8e5e-149b2f50223d-0
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.020
