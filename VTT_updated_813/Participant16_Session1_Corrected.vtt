00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.836
OK, now this study we're
starting to do norming study.

c8beeb3b-52c6-4d15-b084-c09ecf227205-1
00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:13.210
There will be two types of
pictures that you see. The first

c8beeb3b-52c6-4d15-b084-c09ecf227205-2
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.360
type is a complex scene.

70ed5dcc-cf89-4807-9c14-d689a4b4a56b-0
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.709
Imagine that you are describing
the scene to someone who cannot

70ed5dcc-cf89-4807-9c14-d689a4b4a56b-1
00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:28.728
see the picture. Describe what
is happening and what you see in

70ed5dcc-cf89-4807-9c14-d689a4b4a56b-2
00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.308
this scene as thoroughly as
possible. Please try to take

70ed5dcc-cf89-4807-9c14-d689a4b4a56b-3
00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:35.259
between three and five minutes
to describe it.

844661c5-ab7b-4e22-abf4-09fe7539a652-0
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.380
OK, so now we can start the
first one.

be9097fd-a1eb-4c61-a41b-6a5edae14de4-0
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.760
You can begin describing
whenever you're ready.

f50b6739-161c-45db-b927-f397691b82c0-0
00:00:47.310 --> 00:01:07.090


6bd0e451-cd48-4cdf-952d-3771fe7a2486-0
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.340
Are you timing me now?

e6d84ba2-1327-40dd-a918-3b8cd56f1002-0
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.350
Do you time me when I when you
time me? Yes.

4c75c164-eba6-478e-a704-fbd0101ab721-0
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.956
#START_airport This is a very
complicated scene with a lot of

4c75c164-eba6-478e-a704-fbd0101ab721-1
00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.510
characters and action.

ab4e5052-f7b6-4f3a-aee0-4ab111e9bf01-0
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.840
It's based on where's Waldo and.

cf00d76e-1d84-4335-98da-b508da1cd165-0
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.159
Waldo is somewhere among the
many figures and many actions

cf00d76e-1d84-4335-98da-b508da1cd165-1
00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.400
here at the airport.

08cc8939-fd03-4c3b-8156-7c154e9a5341-0
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.692
At the lower part of the screen,
across the bottom of the

08cc8939-fd03-4c3b-8156-7c154e9a5341-1
00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:52.168
picture, we see inside the
airport where people are

08cc8939-fd03-4c3b-8156-7c154e9a5341-2
00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:57.763
checking in checking luggage, a
smuggler has been spotted trying

08cc8939-fd03-4c3b-8156-7c154e9a5341-3
00:01:57.763 --> 00:01:58.710
to smuggle.

b14dd845-eefc-424c-8c60-29cb2bf2c56b-0
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.170
Watches at the customs. People
are waiting for their baggage.

b14dd845-eefc-424c-8c60-29cb2bf2c56b-1
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.193
Here's a couple stewardesses
walking to their plane. Here's

b14dd845-eefc-424c-8c60-29cb2bf2c56b-2
00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:15.550
another and a pilot tipping his
hat to some tourists. So it's a

b14dd845-eefc-424c-8c60-29cb2bf2c56b-3
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.560
busy day in the airport.

0f1a1651-5ea8-46e5-b2c4-3d6d95c8adfe-0
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.540
Out on the tarmac.

f0d00a3a-383c-4655-8c6a-abdeebf54b20-0
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.910
Plane is on boarding.

181e1997-7c71-4fcf-abf6-14979c3d890d-0
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.487
Here's the baggage handlers.
They're sneaking a smoke behind

181e1997-7c71-4fcf-abf6-14979c3d890d-1
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:32.530
some stacks of baggage.

4e04f81c-c6a4-42c6-b8e8-71179758bc0a-0
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.630
Folks are falling off a plane
and into the terminal.

a06abf92-5dda-422c-b035-c281e3e03c8a-0
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.260
Here in the left side.

79ea30ad-5164-44ca-a696-099120582174-0
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.292
Of the picture, here's some
folks getting on to a bus and

79ea30ad-5164-44ca-a696-099120582174-1
00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:50.050
another luggage cart.

ec0e826e-bfdb-4490-a8f2-02ff3c2c10c9-0
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.214
People were unloading the
planes. Uh, here on the other

ec0e826e-bfdb-4490-a8f2-02ff3c2c10c9-1
00:02:57.214 --> 00:03:02.135
side of this screen, people are
getting hosed what's happening

ec0e826e-bfdb-4490-a8f2-02ff3c2c10c9-2
00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:05.649
here and wonder what they think
is going on.

ce323770-3e20-4181-96ee-c346d371c0d0-0
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.410
Here's a little old fashioned
double Decker plane propeller

ce323770-3e20-4181-96ee-c346d371c0d0-1
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.010
plane.

6d13d47a-05df-4a24-91e3-4f4d2108fbdd-0
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.164
My oh my there's several planes.
Here's people they didn't get

6d13d47a-05df-4a24-91e3-4f4d2108fbdd-1
00:03:21.164 --> 00:03:25.481
the steps up to this plane, and
here's series of people who were

6d13d47a-05df-4a24-91e3-4f4d2108fbdd-2
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:29.266
falling down onto the tarmac
before the handlers got the

6d13d47a-05df-4a24-91e3-4f4d2108fbdd-3
00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.130
stairs there.

cf8cecd3-e53d-49f6-ae87-8f50cba32e1c-0
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.940
Up on I'm on the right hand
corner now.

ce97a27b-af07-422a-9e55-b4ae710a3e08-0
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.845
Here's a dirigible hot air
balloon, a helicopter with

ce97a27b-af07-422a-9e55-b4ae710a3e08-1
00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:47.915
everything you can imagine is
going on in this airplane here.

ce97a27b-af07-422a-9e55-b4ae710a3e08-2
00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:52.740
In fact, there's a line of
elephants being loaded onto the

ce97a27b-af07-422a-9e55-b4ae710a3e08-3
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.640
plane here.

212a73b8-0242-4064-91a6-eb5feb2e0970-0
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.720
My oh my oh my there's the
observation tower.

d04423b3-e736-4f80-a280-6ec958eb3220-0
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.312
OK, I think I'm done with this
one. #END_airport Did I cover

d04423b3-e736-4f80-a280-6ec958eb3220-1
00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:12.594
enough? You took about 2
minutes, so if you see anything

d04423b3-e736-4f80-a280-6ec958eb3220-2
00:04:12.594 --> 00:04:12.970
else.

b911473b-5df6-4947-8a03-9fde08360750-0
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.580
You can just.

947c13fe-f7b7-4475-971e-16f75a6b0b26-0
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.510
Well, I see lots of stuff I
don't know whether I should go

947c13fe-f7b7-4475-971e-16f75a6b0b26-1
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.743
into. Every detail. Is the job
here to be thorough and

947c13fe-f7b7-4475-971e-16f75a6b0b26-2
00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:29.207
complete, or to get a clear
narrative that a listener can

947c13fe-f7b7-4475-971e-16f75a6b0b26-3
00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:33.210
follow who's doesn't have the
image in front of it?

6a770197-f130-46c3-a300-b325ad7610e0-0
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.384
In those two, I would say give
more details and be less

6a770197-f130-46c3-a300-b325ad7610e0-1
00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.590
concerned about how.

78072576-9467-4a57-a367-b1b30756c1f0-0
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.430
Um, structure it could be.

6d5c3443-64cc-4e61-b180-ea2109bbb9f5-0
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.710
Since the purpose of our norming
study is to.

95a2b36e-7f3c-4c48-b742-a526164b75c8-0
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.686
Select words. The more detail
and description we get, the

95a2b36e-7f3c-4c48-b742-a526164b75c8-1
00:04:58.686 --> 00:04:59.320
better.

8921a5ab-80af-4115-aab5-37111fa3e242-0
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.890
Shall I do this for now? Over.

c60b659e-3ef2-4b1d-89ff-4d7d1af9af68-0
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.110
If you would like I can do that,
we can do that.

a1768ce1-9797-44f2-add4-b19d9deaf3c7-0
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.341
But I don't think there was
anything wrong in the first

a1768ce1-9797-44f2-add4-b19d9deaf3c7-1
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:12.710
time.

e92af4a5-27ff-4619-82b0-8cb5bc2053ca-0
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.010
OK.

60ce9208-6606-4edd-b86e-472cfc4f212f-0
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.036
Let's go into the next one then.
May we? How many are there in

60ce9208-6606-4edd-b86e-472cfc4f212f-1
00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:24.642
total? There will be 26 items,
but the in the first session

60ce9208-6606-4edd-b86e-472cfc4f212f-2
00:05:24.642 --> 00:05:28.250
people usually complete between
5:00 and 7:00.

e9763356-5a81-481c-beb5-4a446b146254-0
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.930
Ah, OK. I know that sounds like
a reasonable number, OK?

c5045437-9f8d-43c6-bb5c-9b1eaf4816a0-0
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.000
Let's go on it.

07386bbc-3c4a-4398-ab0a-fbb3c630c948-0
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.967
Ohh, my performance then may
itself evolve. Yeah. Does that

07386bbc-3c4a-4398-ab0a-fbb3c630c948-1
00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:47.400
make sense? That makes sense,
OK.

732196fb-14a0-49f4-9eba-815a66930425-0
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.843
This item will be a different
type of pictures. Um, OK, so the

732196fb-14a0-49f4-9eba-815a66930425-1
00:05:53.843 --> 00:05:56.500
next one will be a graphic
novel.

41d59e8b-70e0-4392-ad57-cb8bab967a34-0
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.330
You will look at a series of
pictures instead of 1.

ae4b0bb5-c2d3-413b-9e85-e7f9b0adf8dc-0
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.698
And please describe what you see
and what is happening as you go

ae4b0bb5-c2d3-413b-9e85-e7f9b0adf8dc-1
00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:13.981
through the story. Right. I do
one page at a time. You do one

ae4b0bb5-c2d3-413b-9e85-e7f9b0adf8dc-2
00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:19.519
page at a time. Most stories are
two. You can see 2 pages on one

ae4b0bb5-c2d3-413b-9e85-e7f9b0adf8dc-3
00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:24.802
screen. I see. Yeah, and some
stories will have a two big two

ae4b0bb5-c2d3-413b-9e85-e7f9b0adf8dc-4
00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:29.830
page spread and some stories
will have two separate pages.

1885bedd-9ed2-4fa8-a3b3-f537215d5e86-0
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.600
So just depend on the specific.

b2b0d62f-777f-41be-92e6-bf92a33e26ba-0
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:40.123
Lay out and then should I kill
you then when I want to go to

b2b0d62f-777f-41be-92e6-bf92a33e26ba-1
00:06:40.123 --> 00:06:45.766
the next slide? Yeah, that will
be helpful and please take

b2b0d62f-777f-41be-92e6-bf92a33e26ba-2
00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:51.504
between 10 and 15 minutes. So in
the next. So the next item

b2b0d62f-777f-41be-92e6-bf92a33e26ba-3
00:06:51.504 --> 00:06:57.338
specifically is the longest item
we have overall in terms of

b2b0d62f-777f-41be-92e6-bf92a33e26ba-4
00:06:57.338 --> 00:07:02.980
levels of details, probably
less. You'll have less time to

b2b0d62f-777f-41be-92e6-bf92a33e26ba-5
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.650
finish.

98514aaf-a579-4beb-b2b8-fca7c19034e9-0
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.230
Each page already OK, so that
would already.

0d629b08-e1b1-4984-b097-f2cae121784e-0
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:29.790


2aa7899d-6c90-4a0b-aa80-f839f46525ab-0
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:49.790


5b190860-183a-4419-845c-1ae508341e6a-0
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.970
#START_wanderer On page one of
this story two figures.

1c6e76bd-442c-4689-9384-43f569e28ee3-0
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.740
Are folding a large piece of
paper.

f50afddb-b761-41a1-9690-ef0677cfd27f-0
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.548
Larger than either one of them
twice, twice the dimensions of

f50afddb-b761-41a1-9690-ef0677cfd27f-1

One is a boy with longish hair.

Down the back of his neck and in
his forehead in a striped

And bare feet. The other figure.

One at the front, the smaller in
the back.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.630
Like the sliver of moon has cut
through his head.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.110
The paper they fold is in the
shape of a boat.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.297
And in the second page we see
this little boat next to a huge

00:09:11.297 --> 00:09:14.450
in the water next to a huge
ship.

With windcatcher sails.

cf5acfdc-a5f5-49f3-b0a4-dff8258f40e9-0

Several stories high, a fanciful
ship.

With a kind of diving bell
attached underwater underneath

it.

tiny and hard to see.

On this page we see an aerial
view of that little paper boat.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:07.422
In a choppy ocean, our view is
high up in the sky above a line

12e91be5-4e68-460e-91c8-e2857fad4033-1
00:10:07.422 --> 00:10:10.360
of gulls who are flying.

In the upper right of our

00:10:16.087 --> 00:10:20.858
they diminish down and far below

Now we're back down to water
level. What do we see here,

2428dfdf-d678-4db3-995d-5dddf7dde42f-1
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.100
turtles?

Plaid turtles.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.546
Are they going to overtake our
our little paper ship? It looks

8b8828d3-5a26-47db-b8dd-95510a34453c-1
00:10:50.546 --> 00:10:52.790
like it. Here's a gulf line
nearby.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.940
Something is bubbling up out of
the ocean. A large whale, maybe?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.750

There's a little eye here, and
another smaller little paper

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.970
The colorful fish.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.628

creature with its fin up out of

upon our boat.

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:10.688
no, it's a deep sea diver of
some sort. Not human, for it has

of its legs. Come, come fin like

headed like serpent tubes

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:39.005
tentacles rising up out of the
water to touch the side of the

of the ship or a wall. I I think
it's the side of the ship. There

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:52.770
tapers down to a small mouth
that now grips.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.430
The drooping triangle of our
little boat.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:14.120
inside the tendrils and we see
the dragon like, serpent like.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.070
Of this creature.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.120

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.960
That's caught between the folds.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.889
Of these serpent like or one
giant serpent like creatures,

00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:40.590
though there must be more than
one, because here we see.

fc2d3aa5-ca4c-47f1-abbd-f9a50ae557ea-0
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:48.408
Between the folds the gleaming
eyes of two creatures, 2

a tall stripped.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.390
Our little boat flooded with.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.720
The spewing.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.380

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.820
Long streamers come out of its
two nostrils.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.370

lean over our boat.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.800

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.090
With these streamers of liquid.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.330
Nearby, we see.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:03.211
A strange creature on the
littered beach. A beach littered

737d127e-7321-4815-ae63-58e4d4752d3d-1
00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:04.730

Beer cans, pieces of rubbish and
bottles.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.621
And this Finned creature stands
upright in a striped bathing

2a363d38-24e0-4222-8331-74948a0a9b5c-1

suit, almost as if it were
humanoid, though it's clearly

00:44:20.256 --> 00:44:21.069

This underwater scene is heavily
populated with jellyfish, which

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.790
Many of them.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:27.902
Like many of them, designed like
4 leaf clovers with four

c1e3fd15-07c7-4476-86cb-b77469de8586-1
00:45:27.902 --> 00:45:31.330
horseshoe shapes facing outward.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:39.609
And the frame is filled with
them. Almost hidden behind them

04c2af14-f4c4-46f2-bd7b-7ddb854e7472-1
00:45:39.609 --> 00:45:42.410
I can see our little boat.

be swallowed up, perhaps.

all, but a craft because its

craft. And maybe a craft we've

01:03:00.955 --> 01:03:06.349

01:03:29.703 --> 01:03:34.732
coming up out of the water to a
door that leads to the giant

01:03:34.732 --> 01:03:38.360

01:03:56.639 --> 01:04:02.356
serrated, thin, or pointed spear

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.054
Two children, a boy and a girl,
got caught in the rain. They

An underpass in the park.

While the children are reading
the scroll that the robed old

c0cd173d-5925-41e6-9479-ac5203969c07-1
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:03.310

The door behind him, two armored
guards with Spears come out of

da86cf9e-bb92-4545-9135-a40dba01e43a-1
01:18:13.349 --> 01:18:17.994
the door behind him and grasp
him by the arm and pull him back

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:20.870
into the doorway while he
reaches out.

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:24.990
But as but as he's.

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.750
But as the king is taken away,
he tosses.

bc5cc15a-5c63-49e1-a353-16b0f9ef68d5-0
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.500
His scroll.

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:47.878
I don't know how to interpret
they're holding something too.

01:18:47.878 --> 01:18:49.520
Aren't they and they've already?

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:51.740
Umm.

The doors are shut.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.207
But the children opened their
scrolls and find a key that

278b703f-567b-49b0-9a7d-74b34d33697c-1
01:19:35.207 --> 01:19:36.420
opens the door.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.340
Is that what that is?

a81f37ed-b8b2-4d0e-9911-579f65487525-0
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.980
Ah.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.170
No. OK, let's do this again.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:09.903
These aren't scrolls, these are
crayons. The children take the

cc32b8bd-adf1-480e-a32a-7084b16b340f-1
01:20:09.903 --> 01:20:14.786
crayons and each one draws a
key, one purple and one orange.

cc32b8bd-adf1-480e-a32a-7084b16b340f-2
01:20:14.786 --> 01:20:19.589
And with the keys they unlock
each of the two doors and are

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.536
The two children come through
the tunnel and at the other end

9cab3db6-0c3d-4561-8a7a-7745e51cab32-1
01:20:49.536 --> 01:20:53.280
they find themselves in front of
a great palace.

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:02.140
They climb out onto the rock.

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:06.310
Where they're able to see.

a8acb1d3-d8e4-4feb-a902-8ceb89ecab51-0
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:11.400
A whole city.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.567
And disappearing through the
arch gates, a paddle wheel in

01:21:17.567 --> 01:21:20.510

Orange fire and long streams of
smoke, and in the air dirigibles

passengers.

The children study the map that
the king gave them, while his

01:22:27.381 --> 01:22:33.613
ship takes them him on toward
the horizon, and now we see the

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:41.221
In the 9:00 o'clock clock

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.389
Now we see the bridge itself
stretching over the water

d5fd165f-2314-4ede-bd47-414c7bcbc741-1
01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:39.060
between the stone tower with its
green light.

96afa61a-7bee-4b7f-8468-9a4659f106e0-0
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:40.620
And.

00f92b46-72b1-477e-8964-9fb79b9e16ba-0
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:49.310
is stowed above them at the very
end of the promontory and here.

e6dcca31-eba2-483b-a66a-5b2d5fcbea1a-0
01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:56.219
The boy and the girl are racing
across toward the tower, with

e6dcca31-eba2-483b-a66a-5b2d5fcbea1a-1
01:31:56.219 --> 01:31:59.700
the purple bird flying ahead of
them.

c7dff9fc-cf9b-475b-a49e-538902d50812-0
01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:05.860
{Next.}

ec08e916-fa23-41ba-a4ba-ff068667a60d-0
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.780
They've reached the tower in the
very peak.

bdd592e4-1580-4b3d-b5c7-11aa8e51f293-0
01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:17.533
Above this, above the rope
bridge and be and in pursuit

bdd592e4-1580-4b3d-b5c7-11aa8e51f293-1
01:32:17.533 --> 01:32:22.820
behind them are the armored
soldiers. Two of them are almost

bdd592e4-1580-4b3d-b5c7-11aa8e51f293-2
01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.600
advanced.

b268bf45-043c-44e8-9a25-7226301acd97-0
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:28.641
To the this side of the bridge,
and behind them, several more

b268bf45-043c-44e8-9a25-7226301acd97-1
01:32:28.641 --> 01:32:29.410
are coming.

c92e0974-e52e-480e-8322-93f321de4a2b-0
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.710
While the Purple bird hovers
above.

48dd6ded-b3ed-4f70-80ae-6df56838036d-0
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:42.840
But the resourceful children
take their crayons again and

48dd6ded-b3ed-4f70-80ae-6df56838036d-1
01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.788
begin to draw. She draws a
rectangular box. He draws large,

48dd6ded-b3ed-4f70-80ae-6df56838036d-2
01:32:48.788 --> 01:32:50.970
pedal like propellers.

9ab8b8f3-01aa-4252-9060-4832f7b7e986-0
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:54.310
{Next.}

336688e6-b2ae-4273-8b48-fc6d1a7cb488-0
01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:00.680
And they create a giant
dragonfly.

19b21b4e-b5c4-4c18-a932-fab7397d109c-0
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.075
And a red swing that it carries,
whose ropes it carries in its

19b21b4e-b5c4-4c18-a932-fab7397d109c-1
01:33:07.075 --> 01:33:12.647
mandibles as it flies away,
bearing the children just out of

19b21b4e-b5c4-4c18-a932-fab7397d109c-2
01:33:12.647 --> 01:33:18.219
the reaching arms of the armored
soldiers and off toward the

19b21b4e-b5c4-4c18-a932-fab7397d109c-3
01:33:18.219 --> 01:33:19.590
mountain peaks.

d781cf85-0eb1-441b-ba14-77dccb351d2f-0
01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:31.510
The dragonfly sets them down.

d3eb20e0-082e-432c-af78-b3fd60717941-0
01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.470
On the ornate.

af016312-d531-4060-8510-bde71970cc00-0
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:39.130
Peak.

b19c7122-fa7c-4063-883e-c2b3b300adcc-0
01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.800
Of a Buddhist shrine.

dde8e02a-8f57-4244-9fef-35613061af0e-0
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:50.760
The top is like.

f4fc75b7-6e47-4b76-9868-69f52d49281c-0
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:55.540
A candy urn.

bf867886-8a4c-4e2b-b3b5-3e97638413d9-0
01:33:57.290 --> 01:34:03.260
That rests on several levels of
cover.

bfb027f8-390c-4671-b27a-ff90b46eb5e6-0
01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:06.420
And that there there are four
corners.

bafa9c00-8fe1-4978-bc0f-1e9a43ff97ef-0
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:12.717
There hangs a Lantern. In the
background we can see several

bafa9c00-8fe1-4978-bc0f-1e9a43ff97ef-1
01:34:12.717 --> 01:34:17.524
balloon dirigibles approaching
with armored soldiers, so it

bafa9c00-8fe1-4978-bc0f-1e9a43ff97ef-2
01:34:17.524 --> 01:34:20.890
looks like the children are not
safe yet.

91c4d78b-98a6-42ff-8a2a-fd1f0f9acd57-0
01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.860
And here on the very peak.

7806a3c7-f575-45ae-896e-fe2ad557bc24-0
01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.728
On either side of the structure,
like a layered cake that rises

7806a3c7-f575-45ae-896e-fe2ad557bc24-1
01:34:35.728 --> 01:34:39.500
maybe a dozen layers of
descending size.

ec88b543-4861-4845-9b50-cf12b136b54e-0
01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.540
The girl takes out again.

da1ebfc6-0b93-49f8-9cfc-4041e8d7d390-0
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.890
Her belt of crayons.

2c7c2811-6518-415e-a324-14853b3f52f9-0
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:54.080
Of now six different colors.

4f8bd22e-3a03-4feb-ad00-4f73e8763846-0
01:34:57.210 --> 01:34:58.460
OK, next.

4aa62e08-f0ab-41f8-ae07-636d8bbf9a5c-0
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.770
The balloons were there. Armed
warriors now descend upon.

a90e4240-b952-4b49-8a07-df23a146c875-0
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:13.080
Children on the peak of the
Buddhist shrine.

2301b8a4-63bb-4928-b72d-eff0afe4da02-0
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:17.710
And there are several of these.

878a5bcf-ee6d-421a-8de9-60797c9c2e5b-0
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.920
The.

eaaf6c4e-7258-4911-8735-942abe8e708d-0
01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.470
Over the heads of the children.

e7ccbbe7-5f88-4942-beca-6023378f512d-0
01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:30.080
And between the two.

e2e760c7-6367-48a9-865f-2cf90a629961-0
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.300
Descending.

2f1d2238-f836-4cd9-bdf0-7d798bbafb18-0
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:38.520
Fighter balloons.

89b28385-40d4-4eb2-a4cd-4e0f3d78d50e-0
01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.961
The Purple Bird holds the belt
of crayons. In the hands of one

89b28385-40d4-4eb2-a4cd-4e0f3d78d50e-1
01:35:44.961 --> 01:35:50.266
of the soldiers we see a gold
cage and he is reaching out

89b28385-40d4-4eb2-a4cd-4e0f3d78d50e-2
01:35:50.266 --> 01:35:51.730
toward the bird.

3f42386f-b857-4dea-960f-d8a6eccd81a7-0
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.730
{Next.}

b712156d-df35-4dfd-9b07-90bce8af011a-0
01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:02.190
But dramatically.

a0cb1c09-854a-4c15-9e18-1f275708db50-0
01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.302
The bird flies off, trailing
behind it a bright rainbow of

a0cb1c09-854a-4c15-9e18-1f275708db50-1
01:36:08.302 --> 01:36:08.870
colors.

2319bdc1-ff68-44a7-804c-24e05aaf7287-0
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:12.120
That.

a98b7b64-4cde-4543-aa66-5b3907b564e5-0
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:18.233
Like a concussion, scatter the
aircraft of the armored soldiers

a98b7b64-4cde-4543-aa66-5b3907b564e5-1
01:36:18.233 --> 01:36:20.830
that are attacking the children.

7cd3f109-f746-4d72-aa67-e854331fb6e2-0
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:27.118
They hang for dear life to the
rigging of the airships and are

7cd3f109-f746-4d72-aa67-e854331fb6e2-1
01:36:27.118 --> 01:36:31.670
blinded by the light so that
they have to cover their eyes.

fe0115a4-14da-4699-9340-12732d3a4350-0
01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.050
{Next.}

26c4057a-cd7f-4e0f-b0c0-a6a0b2dce5a4-0
01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:46.343
And we see the end of the
rainbow come down on the ship of

26c4057a-cd7f-4e0f-b0c0-a6a0b2dce5a4-1
01:36:46.343 --> 01:36:51.566
armored men that have been
bearing the king away as he

26c4057a-cd7f-4e0f-b0c0-a6a0b2dce5a4-2
01:36:51.566 --> 01:36:56.030
raises his arms in celebration
and exultation.

20ddc44d-2e0e-4608-8078-dc367fab791f-0
01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.570
The bird flies over.

d60f405f-2aeb-49a2-aabf-f3e3a5e33dce-0
01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.780
The plane and scatters the
armored soldiers into the water.

1056e77b-cc4e-4c7b-94e9-4d4ee5e0e1f2-0
01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:12.750
Freeing the King and his.

9f5e0577-6ab8-4bab-909d-f8d5428feb9b-0
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.400
gendarme.

72c9a889-6705-4514-81c5-6831b816d33c-0
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:21.920
Who are these other people? Are
they captives?

b94de5af-2642-4840-a304-5aff8ae66839-0
01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:24.810
Umm.

b770bae4-118e-4896-a982-f223bac34cc0-0
01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.130
{OK, next one.}

b3ddf955-397a-41c9-b492-5016521def90-0
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:46.681
All the city celebrates as the
King returns riding the purple

b3ddf955-397a-41c9-b492-5016521def90-1
01:37:46.681 --> 01:37:52.670
rhinoceros with the two children
riding behind him in the Red X.

15e5f39f-1307-44d8-8b58-ccacf5f2daf5-0
01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.130
Ohh.

6a146396-4b5a-4578-ab5e-336b184b9d53-0
01:37:56.190 --> 01:38:01.300
A golden paddle boat bears the
king back into the city.

c767f84f-d071-482a-9a5a-3ea76c1fead9-0
01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:03.780
Followed by.

da88bcd0-805c-4ce0-a176-a9688c6ee243-0
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:09.520
A sprightly band of musicians.

1482d4ab-0617-4b83-a93d-207f888903c5-0
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:21.740
While all the city celebrates
from their windows and towers.

05e535fe-7db5-4344-b14f-088140786876-0
01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:33.050
And the purple bird flies
happily overhead.

f23a3c87-698f-453b-b85d-99c29b224a71-0
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.210
Enough.

673fb196-c30f-4d11-ac33-00960bb8b28a-0
01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:57.199
King's boat returns the children
to the rock and to The Cave that

673fb196-c30f-4d11-ac33-00960bb8b28a-1
01:38:57.199 --> 01:38:58.890
will lead them back.

a96ab7d7-0ef4-46a2-a310-19c795e7722d-0
01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.000
He graciously helps them down
off.

717f276e-8d28-413d-9f6c-bc87b73b0670-0
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:11.060
The rhinoceros.

9d475f12-3928-4820-83f6-8525aed071a4-0
01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.880
And escorts them back.

cd3d2885-d540-4c7f-bd4d-abf6c587ca21-0
01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.330
To the doorway.

5e4b265c-9c7b-4fa7-ac97-745012afdc7f-0
01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:41.895
But as he does, he takes his
golden crayon and draws for each

5e4b265c-9c7b-4fa7-ac97-745012afdc7f-1
01:39:41.895 --> 01:39:45.610
of them a golden crown like his
own which.

1faef5d1-05ce-489c-94b1-59146159b59d-0
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.350
He places.

087b92a4-922a-44e9-8e6e-2d6fc893b390-0
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.600
1st on the boy, then on the
girl.

895df184-6f11-455f-a00a-e238ca65ab22-0
01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.330
Next.

363d6885-cb69-45df-abc0-31d392ffb1cb-0
01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:07.780
And as they.

5a0963c8-a987-41b3-ace1-07345b599b28-0
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:16.287
As they come back through the
tunnel and look back out of the

5a0963c8-a987-41b3-ace1-07345b599b28-1
01:40:16.287 --> 01:40:20.675
overpass, they see that the rain
has stopped. The sky is clear

5a0963c8-a987-41b3-ace1-07345b599b28-2
01:40:20.675 --> 01:40:24.853
and a beautiful rainbow arches
over the towers of the city.

5a0963c8-a987-41b3-ace1-07345b599b28-3
01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:25.550
#END_quest

c04b2e1a-e721-4072-81ab-3faf1ca3ac7b-0
01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:30.490
That's the end of the story.

1f242978-84b9-47bd-9fea-8bc6b4b5c759-0
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:36.190
And go to the next item which is
a complex scene.

caa2e511-eb14-4ee1-8b98-4cc55df4cbad-0
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.250
