00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.722
So in the study you do two kinds
of tasks. The first type is. You

c7975f6b-c91e-47f5-a71f-094772cc99e5-1
00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:14.430
will see a complex scene.
Imagine that you're describing

c7975f6b-c91e-47f5-a71f-094772cc99e5-2
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.900
it to someone who cannot see the
picture.

7056d817-04ed-4ac4-977b-2194b6eacc2d-0
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.765
Tell me what is happening and
what you see, and this much in

7056d817-04ed-4ac4-977b-2194b6eacc2d-1
00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:28.265
as much detail as possible. I
would time us so by 5 minutes

7056d817-04ed-4ac4-977b-2194b6eacc2d-2
00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:32.690
I'll just ask you to stop, but
take between three and five

7056d817-04ed-4ac4-977b-2194b6eacc2d-3
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.290
minutes.

11857bfd-d977-46ce-85c8-f0deeaf96d74-0
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.980
And describe it as best as you
can.

ae44babd-d6ea-44c2-8d74-bc30f698c1aa-0
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.550
Oh wow. Yeah, it's a lot
happening here, OK.

1bceddf4-2e78-4e3e-8e36-4c83a6ae8c47-0
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.590
Alright. Um, should I go ahead
and start? OK.

2f2ae89a-302b-4bb7-a3fb-33c39f264a2a-0
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.470
#START_deep_sea_divers It's very
colorful.

0d57601f-dd27-43da-ba65-398c75f28ca8-0
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.210
With.

108fea7e-0a36-4aa2-97e4-9e5bfeb5bea9-0
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.480
With a variety of colors being
used.

77bcff3b-ce6e-4290-94d2-c062565f26ac-0
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.390
Umm.

a7577240-2ff8-4f0c-a059-a2a3dc968069-0
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.078
The picture in the print is very
detailed and fine. Like small

a7577240-2ff8-4f0c-a059-a2a3dc968069-1
00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:22.690
fine.

9317a513-275a-4e85-9dd0-8d8bfe8881df-0
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.196
It is a scene of something
aquatic. So the top part of the

9317a513-275a-4e85-9dd0-8d8bfe8881df-1
00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:39.701
picture is sea level or above
and the bottom 2/3 of the

9317a513-275a-4e85-9dd0-8d8bfe8881df-2
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:47.875
picture are below the water to
the to to I guess the the sea

9317a513-275a-4e85-9dd0-8d8bfe8881df-3
00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:48.680
floor.

6fadf5e3-6f72-40cc-b34b-e7a7f0f50a90-0
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.040
There are.

9c8961cd-d5c6-42aa-a0be-fdba3faeed7e-0
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.720
Multiple.

2ee6343e-0ab8-4c2c-8ddf-b7f677de27ea-0
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.370
I guess they're different
people. There are multiple.

b11d12a2-e353-4157-a006-326c2449a523-0
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.261
It looks like I can't tell if
it's men and women, but there

b11d12a2-e353-4157-a006-326c2449a523-1
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.260
are multiple people and they're
indifferent.

4d3af093-431f-4c7a-9fd8-dd12a1a3e467-0
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.621
They're repeated throughout the
picture. For instance, there are

4d3af093-431f-4c7a-9fd8-dd12a1a3e467-1
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:24.290
several people in one boat, but
there's.

201cbc58-7ec0-4b57-b8c3-fd6eb06ed151-0
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.860
Let's see. I might just have to
move you just to see 123.

8a3b1158-c8f2-4278-9fd6-2d50adfd2414-0
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.055
I believe there's 19 boats in
the picture and the boats are

8a3b1158-c8f2-4278-9fd6-2d50adfd2414-1
00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:53.660
either red and white stripes
horizontally.

d2abbf81-fc39-4820-b0df-843def268151-0
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.675
Blue and white stripes
horizontally or green and white

d2abbf81-fc39-4820-b0df-843def268151-1
00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:01.430
stripes horizontally?

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-0
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.376
It's it's is it like a isn't
like a walk where's Waldo?

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-1
00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:14.916
Waldo. Yeah. So it's like a
where's Waldo type of a picture

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-2
00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:19.758
that's why I thought initially
and then I was like and then the

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-3
00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:24.146
the the same striped colors that
are on the boats are the

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-4
00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:28.837
clothing the same patterns of
clothing that the difference it

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-5
00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:33.301
made it it's hard to tell if
it's men and women or whether

63008960-c239-41ff-95e9-1ee0afbdf002-6
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:33.680
it's.

3f9a9762-2403-4e84-b222-cdea21a91cd3-0
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.268
Just men, but the people are
wearing either red and white

3f9a9762-2403-4e84-b222-cdea21a91cd3-1
00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:45.357
striped pants or clothing, green
and white stripes, or blue and

3f9a9762-2403-4e84-b222-cdea21a91cd3-2
00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:51.160
white stripes. There are also
there are mermaids throughout.

3f9a9762-2403-4e84-b222-cdea21a91cd3-3
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.249
The mermaids have yellow blonde
hair with a green fin and tail.

533c1886-e011-45fb-ba0b-119b89a3cf48-0
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.290
There are other sea creatures.

afe39216-6e1e-4e1c-a50e-e872bc686925-0
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.830
There are several different
types of fish. Some are yellow,

afe39216-6e1e-4e1c-a50e-e872bc686925-1
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.580
some are orange, some are red,
some are blue.

391d792c-0756-4d72-aad8-fcf38398a1b0-0
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.450
There are.

9493c24e-118e-4deb-b4d6-02f505eafa39-0
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.410
It looks like maybe.

f8d45b79-4f02-4b62-ab21-b74a1586b505-0
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.470
Oysters or clams?

1faeb76f-cf21-4192-908b-efe730d6b710-0
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.023
There are. There's at least one
shark. There's at least one

1faeb76f-cf21-4192-908b-efe730d6b710-1
00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:29.940
octopus.

1cdec330-2641-4504-a0df-16be0f50c45f-0
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.750
There are.

1c8b4728-5a0e-4dc5-b1de-a950e0ac83a0-0
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.400
Let's see.

f17f0539-8668-43c2-93be-540416946ebf-0
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.331
There are, see, I don't. They
kind of look like coral, like

f17f0539-8668-43c2-93be-540416946ebf-1
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:47.470
sea plant type things.

b468c953-cd68-4779-a071-b57502b19c12-0
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.900
There's.

c2c21499-e94a-474e-aa28-a3e4cb04e947-0
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.454
And there's Nets, there's, I
swear there's canes in there as

c2c21499-e94a-474e-aa28-a3e4cb04e947-1
00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:03.927
well. Sometimes the, the, the
different people are holding

c2c21499-e94a-474e-aa28-a3e4cb04e947-2
00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:08.400
different things. There are some
Canes, there's some Nets.

e797ccb6-33a8-4b06-ad68-daf5b88b5ff9-0
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.359
Um, there's actually a hand at
the bottom sea floor that's

e797ccb6-33a8-4b06-ad68-daf5b88b5ff9-1
00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:17.193
growing. It appears to be
growing out of like a coral

e797ccb6-33a8-4b06-ad68-daf5b88b5ff9-2
00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:17.620
plant.

66c143d1-7285-4370-a3bf-037e839d842a-0
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.510
There is.

3acc826b-8f62-4860-a90a-ac1404b1d2dd-0
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.750
A treasure chest.

c2630396-30e0-49cc-8429-90bd54110c6a-0
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.640
There is.

c792a61d-1c1d-48f9-8fc7-982733806528-0
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.780
There's some other random.

dd7bcaab-9f9b-4b5e-b8ca-785f4d921738-0
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.600
Items like I see an ice skate, I
see jellyfish.

3f25cd53-1864-4903-b073-f02ed814a0f7-0
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.110
Uh.

0d61816b-8b29-4a40-b7cd-f231285b6b4b-0
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.845
Well, I can see. And the the
people are all doing different

0d61816b-8b29-4a40-b7cd-f231285b6b4b-1
00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:48.128
things. So when they're in the
boats, there are some that are a

0d61816b-8b29-4a40-b7cd-f231285b6b4b-2
00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:51.140
lot of them are holding fish,
fishing poles.

c8f0f06f-12c1-49cc-9e56-ca8eb769d1c0-0
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.665
There are also on the top part
of the picture some rock

c8f0f06f-12c1-49cc-9e56-ca8eb769d1c0-1
00:05:57.665 --> 00:06:03.182
formations that are above the
water and the there are people

c8f0f06f-12c1-49cc-9e56-ca8eb769d1c0-2
00:06:03.182 --> 00:06:08.790
who are on the rock formation
sitting there, some of them are

c8f0f06f-12c1-49cc-9e56-ca8eb769d1c0-3
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.036
holding fishing poles there.
#END_deep_sea_divers Is that

c8f0f06f-12c1-49cc-9e56-ca8eb769d1c0-4
00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:16.839
this. OK, that's good. OK, OK. 

8dc089f9-38e0-4417-9944-4893f57ab7ca-0
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.240
Next. That's hard, yeah. 

d79f4aba-ac0b-4b29-8568-20d02316776d-0
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.430
Yeah, OK.

2f98977a-e525-44ee-9922-fed4cb11ecb8-0
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.645
#START_waldo_1 Alright, should I
go ahead and start? Yes. OK,

2f98977a-e525-44ee-9922-fed4cb11ecb8-1
00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:35.340
this appears to be another
where's Waldo seemed.

b07fb908-f3e6-4e18-8548-786f41ff02ad-0
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.900
Picture this picture is.

3f9e1638-e8d7-43d0-a96e-60de8084bf03-0
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.178
Above is if you're looking down
into a city like a a main part

3f9e1638-e8d7-43d0-a96e-60de8084bf03-1
00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:52.577
of the city. In the center of
the picture there is. It's not a

3f9e1638-e8d7-43d0-a96e-60de8084bf03-2
00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:57.633
square, it's a triangle with a
fountain. A fountain like a

3f9e1638-e8d7-43d0-a96e-60de8084bf03-3
00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:03.117
water, not a water fountain you
would drink out of, but a water

3f9e1638-e8d7-43d0-a96e-60de8084bf03-4
00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:08.345
fountain that's round, that
sprays water out. There are cars

3f9e1638-e8d7-43d0-a96e-60de8084bf03-5
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.430
that are going around the
triangle.

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-0
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.510
And on each side of the
triangle, there are different

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-1
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.398
buildings, some of which are
businesses. There's a Barber

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-2
00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:26.864
shop, it looks like maybe
there's a bookstore. There

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-3
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:31.667
appears to be like an open air
market on one side of the

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-4
00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:36.639
triangle. On another side. It
looks as if there might be a

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-5
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.190
hotel. There's a house. No,
maybe that's not a house.

b3255b87-c9f3-4446-bab7-7e4dfbe996da-6
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.779
That's.

e2ddcef8-bfaf-4ef9-aa29-31283d08c96d-0
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.910
The garage slash gas station.

6fec7a14-8e47-42a2-822f-9b5f341f7096-0
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.553
And there's again, you'll see
this theme of the red and white

6fec7a14-8e47-42a2-822f-9b5f341f7096-1
00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:55.699
striped, the blue and white
striped and the green and white

6fec7a14-8e47-42a2-822f-9b5f341f7096-2
00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:00.051
striped throughout their used on
the coverings that the market

6fec7a14-8e47-42a2-822f-9b5f341f7096-3
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:03.990
for the tents, they're used on
awnings on the buildings.

bcb3edcf-45ec-4302-bbed-23a648c49b68-0
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.940
There are.

e0d398ec-dc77-453a-b6e0-039f2b2b15d5-0
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.330
There are men and women in
they're all dressed.

da8c2e40-3791-4d44-bca2-4b4833743037-0
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.663
Differently. They're not dressed
like the last picture. I can

da8c2e40-3791-4d44-bca2-4b4833743037-1
00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:26.454
tell that there's different
races of people in this picture

da8c2e40-3791-4d44-bca2-4b4833743037-2
00:08:26.454 --> 00:08:32.245
as well. There are there's a
statue on the triangle next to

da8c2e40-3791-4d44-bca2-4b4833743037-3
00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:38.422
the fountain. There's there's a
school in the distance that the

da8c2e40-3791-4d44-bca2-4b4833743037-4
00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:39.869
children go to.

bedaef9f-4f94-421c-82b0-dcb2eb4c862f-0
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.567
There are different vehicles.
There's a bus, there's cars,

bedaef9f-4f94-421c-82b0-dcb2eb4c862f-1
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.890
there's trucks, there's some
bicycles.

91cfc788-e2a7-4c70-93e7-6cfe0f294942-0
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.194
There are on one of the
buildings, there are men who are

91cfc788-e2a7-4c70-93e7-6cfe0f294942-1
00:08:56.194 --> 00:09:00.980
washing the windows and washing
the side of the building.

91cfc788-e2a7-4c70-93e7-6cfe0f294942-2
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.190
They're on ladders. There are.
Let's see, there's.

48857e24-3b7e-47c2-9119-4f5a652912ea-0
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.255
There's kind of people all over
walking dogs, using canes,

48857e24-3b7e-47c2-9119-4f5a652912ea-1
00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:21.309
playing the violin, riding their
bicycle, reading the newspaper,

48857e24-3b7e-47c2-9119-4f5a652912ea-2
00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:27.084
dining outside at a table from a
cafe, running, holding hands

48857e24-3b7e-47c2-9119-4f5a652912ea-3
00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:27.550
with.

f172052f-428b-4b4a-bea1-0eda8fe80680-0
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.360
With another person.

524f1cbe-bb0d-4750-bef9-21dd7e727d2a-0
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.840
Somebody's working on a car.

81ac292e-9fb0-4811-9609-86e821ea8df8-0
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.160
People are window gazing,
they're entering and exiting the

81ac292e-9fb0-4811-9609-86e821ea8df8-1
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.140
buildings. They're waving and
talking to each other.

0244d21c-c415-48b8-8c95-a03ffb1db77d-0
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.770
They're shopping at the market.
There's people working inside of

0244d21c-c415-48b8-8c95-a03ffb1db77d-1
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.897
an office building that is being
the windows are being cleaned.

0244d21c-c415-48b8-8c95-a03ffb1db77d-2
00:09:53.897 --> 00:09:57.250
You can see them at their desk
typing on the phone.

5f94c96f-d194-4d36-83a0-f476a3e511c0-0
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.907
There's it looks on one building
that there might be firemen who

5f94c96f-d194-4d36-83a0-f476a3e511c0-1
00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:07.687
are trying to get to a fire
because they have hoses and

5f94c96f-d194-4d36-83a0-f476a3e511c0-2
00:10:07.687 --> 00:10:12.007
they're on the roof. There are
people also that are stranded on

5f94c96f-d194-4d36-83a0-f476a3e511c0-3
00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:16.125
the roof of the hotel. So I'm
assuming that there might be a

5f94c96f-d194-4d36-83a0-f476a3e511c0-4
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:17.610
fire in that building.

763f124b-5b55-46ff-b073-0d3d8d812d8f-0
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.842
There's birds, there are there's
an accident between two cars on

763f124b-5b55-46ff-b073-0d3d8d812d8f-1
00:10:23.842 --> 00:10:25.700
the street. #END_waldo_1

a62a1d22-944c-462f-a8bd-7aaf43e21e5e-0
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.370
You can stop now. OK, alright,
so next.

382b0ffb-dc07-444d-b407-6d4420221bb2-0
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:39.036
We'll go into graphic novels.
There will be series of pictures

382b0ffb-dc07-444d-b407-6d4420221bb2-1
00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:44.108
that tell a story. Again,
describe what you see and what

382b0ffb-dc07-444d-b407-6d4420221bb2-2
00:10:44.108 --> 00:10:49.892
is happening in detail. At most
will be 30 pages, but most are a

382b0ffb-dc07-444d-b407-6d4420221bb2-3
00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:50.960
lot shorter.

27836013-7133-41e7-bb25-2bc8014ed0af-0
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.070
Will take around 10 to 15
minutes.

2da3f801-8edd-4e4d-bc36-8e570909fe54-0
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.510
OK.

32f1210b-b293-4403-b898-e9516f8e2b4b-0
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.425
OK, whenever you're ready, you
can take a minute to look at it

32f1210b-b293-4403-b898-e9516f8e2b4b-1
00:11:05.425 --> 00:11:05.990
and OK.

0ce8e610-f374-459d-aac6-d20e9cdd2566-0
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.490
Who? OK.

1621f1ec-8c9e-41e1-9e03-9f416a05438c-0
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.680
Well, the page starts it's.

5c9a53fc-24a8-4c14-998e-672a990b8420-0
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.018
#START_arrival_4 It's like a
black and white type of drawing

5c9a53fc-24a8-4c14-998e-672a990b8420-1
00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:25.320
for the pictures.

ee79df7a-98bf-4ddc-ab8d-b6774bf7a42f-0
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.523
It starts with a man who appears
to maybe be in the shower. He's

ee79df7a-98bf-4ddc-ab8d-b6774bf7a42f-1
00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:37.738
showering. He then is at the
sink where he is shaving,

ee79df7a-98bf-4ddc-ab8d-b6774bf7a42f-2
00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:39.350
shaving his face.

1105ec08-bfc0-48f8-a243-a1b8e84364e4-0
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.692
Uh. He then gets dressed. He
puts on a white button down

1105ec08-bfc0-48f8-a243-a1b8e84364e4-1
00:11:45.692 --> 00:11:51.542
shirt and a dark colored vest
that he buttons. He then puts on

1105ec08-bfc0-48f8-a243-a1b8e84364e4-2
00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:57.484
dark pants and ties his shoes.
He's wearing dark colored shoes.

1105ec08-bfc0-48f8-a243-a1b8e84364e4-3
00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:02.870
He takes some money, which
appears to be bills and coins.

601b9eca-2ef2-40c1-828b-ece0c04e7330-0
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.500
Then he picks up his hat.

56d04177-10f7-40a5-8b19-2bf9967bd276-0
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:17.423
And he looks at a map of some
sort. He has the map in his

56d04177-10f7-40a5-8b19-2bf9967bd276-1
00:12:17.423 --> 00:12:18.110
hand.

246afd74-a2d2-49d5-8c24-a605f93dc32d-0
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.900
And he is reading the map.

f02b6ae7-2a42-4c33-89d6-9a8ee5499990-0
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.690
And there is.

5e5479ff-efc4-46e5-a211-9b175dde1c42-0
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:33.187
I don't know what that is. Uh,
some kind of, I guess, animal

5e5479ff-efc4-46e5-a211-9b175dde1c42-1
00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:36.910
that is on the ground looking up
at him.

4bb3795d-ec9a-4d70-967a-89baf1eb1da4-0
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.220
He appears to.

aa30f5c2-5329-45b1-9e2f-2e8dcd0b5ad0-0
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.060
Then continue one past the
animal.

b8234d31-7736-4033-900a-4cfb3510be01-0
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.390
Um, and I can't tell if the
animals behind him following

b8234d31-7736-4033-900a-4cfb3510be01-1
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.100
him, but he then moves past the
animal.

22a6e240-ff2f-4311-ac22-eadbcfff5811-0
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.400
There is then a picture of.

59b62eed-5c00-4950-a38e-146ed3d2d403-0
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.070
Some sort of industrialized.

c85b4f4b-6be3-418e-95e4-85f17873cfd3-0
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.589
I can't tell if it's a roadway,
but it's some kind of

c85b4f4b-6be3-418e-95e4-85f17873cfd3-1
00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:17.102
passageway. It's either a
roadway or a waterway to

c85b4f4b-6be3-418e-95e4-85f17873cfd3-2
00:13:17.102 --> 00:13:22.855
transport. There's some kind of
vehicle transport. It looks like

c85b4f4b-6be3-418e-95e4-85f17873cfd3-3
00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:28.519
there's a big cup, several large
buildings, possibly factories,

c85b4f4b-6be3-418e-95e4-85f17873cfd3-4
00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:32.060
because there's white clouds and
smoke.

54766cb3-5ce7-4545-979f-6c91c7eba391-0
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.700
Um, he then?

b7ec59d2-6678-423f-8121-cb0f6c2941d1-0
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.530
It appears he's looking at the
map again.

86d0d2ca-a699-4f78-b532-becbc23f0c3d-0
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.470
I cannot tell what language it
is or if it's uh like a coded

86d0d2ca-a699-4f78-b532-becbc23f0c3d-1
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:54.070
map, but he is. He is looking at
the map and he this little

86d0d2ca-a699-4f78-b532-becbc23f0c3d-2
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.810
animal is then next to him
again.

04bfe872-ed25-48f1-a624-3b058300cf49-0
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.770
And then there is a bigger
picture of.

b555bc5b-7fc8-4468-bc79-66295d0f8f35-0
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.212
What appears to be a large
structure with openings that are

b555bc5b-7fc8-4468-bc79-66295d0f8f35-1
00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:13.050
arched arched openings.

a3e69df2-59c0-4c0e-8537-903901ad28fb-0
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:14.950
Umm.

f8d9c3a5-61c8-41d7-b494-18599d988222-0
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.520
And.

e02c4680-ac82-430f-a133-73f1ca3ab446-0
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:25.149
Flying through the air they look
like boats that have propellers,

e02c4680-ac82-430f-a133-73f1ca3ab446-1
00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:27.530
so it's like a flying boat.

5399b0a3-704d-4b34-8946-f6c98dd968ec-0
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.770
Or a flying ship.

3095df3b-6cca-4911-80f3-31c0f90df330-0
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.260
And then on the ground there
are.

8db17d84-cfcd-477d-927f-2cb18c40571b-0
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.460
Cone like structures.

5219c5f5-427e-440d-9435-341ab0e2eda4-0
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.120
Several cone like structures.

ca0d31ad-3191-4420-b24f-dec615187a93-0
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.656
That people are standing in
front of as if they were on a

ca0d31ad-3191-4420-b24f-dec615187a93-1
00:14:52.656 --> 00:14:58.279
train track, like a train track,
and there's people standing

ca0d31ad-3191-4420-b24f-dec615187a93-2
00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:03.718
there kind of waiting and
talking. Some people are reading

ca0d31ad-3191-4420-b24f-dec615187a93-3
00:15:03.718 --> 00:15:09.618
the newspaper. It appears that
there are maybe cats, maybe cats

ca0d31ad-3191-4420-b24f-dec615187a93-4
00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:14.319
wandering through as well on the
on the the track.

34b3496e-b6eb-475d-a2ec-bfe3214f782b-0
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.017
And I don't know what else to
describe. I mean I can try to

34b3496e-b6eb-475d-a2ec-bfe3214f782b-1
00:15:21.017 --> 00:15:25.181
describe the cone in more
detail. Each cone has a

34b3496e-b6eb-475d-a2ec-bfe3214f782b-2
00:15:25.181 --> 00:15:30.429
circular. It's not an opening,
but it opens. It doesn't go all

34b3496e-b6eb-475d-a2ec-bfe3214f782b-3
00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:35.509
the way through. It looks like
it opens partially, but there

34b3496e-b6eb-475d-a2ec-bfe3214f782b-4
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:40.090
seems to be a circular opening
on each one of the cone

34b3496e-b6eb-475d-a2ec-bfe3214f782b-5
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.089
structures. 

07636e2d-b5d7-4159-a9d7-5be411b7c379-0
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.260
On this page.

693172f3-99f6-4397-9336-94cfbe96608e-0
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.950
Let's see, there we go. OK?

c896dc3d-16a2-4f99-8662-19e8f11e8345-0
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.840
So the small animal that was
with the man.

236fb09b-ba2f-4127-beb4-364977144a71-0
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:06.748
Has now found another animal
that appears to possibly be some

236fb09b-ba2f-4127-beb4-364977144a71-1
00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:08.040
kind of a.

e74eeb25-f4d6-4a47-8654-63af6a88c920-0
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.770
A created bird type. It's almost
like a.

bb0d9bf1-698e-4737-b259-606674aa72ea-0
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.760
Like a bird with two ears that
point straight up, the first

bb0d9bf1-698e-4737-b259-606674aa72ea-1
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.340
animal has a tail that is kind
of long and curls over its head.

c32b628b-ede9-434d-a5a3-af388f7b01b6-0
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:32.850
And it has a very long wide
mouth with shorter ears.

6c136501-3db0-4dbd-ae3a-4591f8ba92bc-0
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.685
So the man is standing there
with his animal behind him,

6c136501-3db0-4dbd-ae3a-4591f8ba92bc-1
00:16:38.685 --> 00:16:42.779
looking at the map. And this
other animal there is a woman

6c136501-3db0-4dbd-ae3a-4591f8ba92bc-2
00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:47.012
wearing a long dress who has a
book in her hand, and they're

6c136501-3db0-4dbd-ae3a-4591f8ba92bc-3
00:16:47.012 --> 00:16:49.580
kind of standing next to each
other.

95a15892-2010-4a5e-aea1-04726d4eb8b7-0
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:55.731
The man then it appears, to ask
the woman for some assistance in

95a15892-2010-4a5e-aea1-04726d4eb8b7-1
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:58.270
deciphering or reading the map.

d21298f1-3824-4633-9175-a311dd214558-0
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:05.700
So she goes over and she is
pointing to.

1efbafb8-cdcf-4ed6-918a-b2c531a25f62-0
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.680
See something on the map to show
the man?

90fe2177-67a1-4d47-805b-65b5d420a984-0
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.370
And she appears to be.

fe5f602c-d6e5-42cf-8135-8ac44af54888-0
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.320
Showing him.

9d5e05a1-8a45-4625-b8a3-2177ff7461e6-0
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.078
It it's a picture, the picture
on the map looks like one of the

9d5e05a1-8a45-4625-b8a3-2177ff7461e6-1
00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:26.200
ships or the boats that has the
propellers on the back.

fc8fb307-1ac8-43dd-888e-44278327bb6a-0
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:34.912
She then shows the man to
something that she points him

fc8fb307-1ac8-43dd-888e-44278327bb6a-1
00:17:34.912 --> 00:17:35.850
over to.

2ee62ab9-36c4-4682-98f8-a1bf3828e0fb-0
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:44.533
Something that looks like an old
style Rotary telephone. The

2ee62ab9-36c4-4682-98f8-a1bf3828e0fb-1
00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:50.870
dials on that, but it's on. It's
on a long tubular.

e924033e-9b09-4126-8379-d733095bbdbd-0
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.480
That's a good. I don't know how
to describe that.

da9e0780-bc7e-43c0-a851-d18d7adbcc7d-0
00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:04.235
It's like a like almost like a
coffee urn or coffee pot. And

da9e0780-bc7e-43c0-a851-d18d7adbcc7d-1
00:18:04.235 --> 00:18:09.962
then on the front side it has a
round dial that's very similar

da9e0780-bc7e-43c0-a851-d18d7adbcc7d-2
00:18:09.962 --> 00:18:15.508
to like a Rotary phone. And she
pushes, I guess she pushes a

da9e0780-bc7e-43c0-a851-d18d7adbcc7d-3
00:18:15.508 --> 00:18:21.053
button on that Rotary and then
she pulls a handle that is on

da9e0780-bc7e-43c0-a851-d18d7adbcc7d-4
00:18:21.053 --> 00:18:25.689
the side of this tubular piece,
similar to like a.

99d4bb71-68b7-4c2f-b2c0-7a6e76bb2208-0
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.887
A slot machine, kind of a
handle, and when she pulls the

99d4bb71-68b7-4c2f-b2c0-7a6e76bb2208-1
00:18:31.887 --> 00:18:37.577
lever out from this machine
comes a ticket, maybe looks like

99d4bb71-68b7-4c2f-b2c0-7a6e76bb2208-2
00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:43.453
possibly like a little ticket,
and she shows the ticket to the

99d4bb71-68b7-4c2f-b2c0-7a6e76bb2208-3
00:18:43.453 --> 00:18:49.237
man and then hands the ticket
over to the man. She then pulls

99d4bb71-68b7-4c2f-b2c0-7a6e76bb2208-4
00:18:49.237 --> 00:18:54.647
out what looks to be a pocket
watch and I'm assuming that

99d4bb71-68b7-4c2f-b2c0-7a6e76bb2208-5
00:18:54.647 --> 00:18:56.700
she's telling the man.

e5c6d371-a90f-42dd-be08-21facffd94c1-0
00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:04.043
He's got to hurry to make the
the ride so the man follows. It

e5c6d371-a90f-42dd-be08-21facffd94c1-1
00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:05.890
looks like he's.

a542e947-b49b-47aa-9485-6bc9f42aacd4-0
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.930
Well, no, that's not right.

47bf830b-85b0-4fea-bf83-ed160926ae2f-0
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.420
So then the.

8ef7ac7c-199e-4ee3-9eca-a385528c70c7-0
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.747
They look up into the sky and
they can see these little ship

8ef7ac7c-199e-4ee3-9eca-a385528c70c7-1
00:19:20.747 --> 00:19:25.425
boats that have the propellers,
these flying little boat ships,

8ef7ac7c-199e-4ee3-9eca-a385528c70c7-2
00:19:25.425 --> 00:19:30.029
and they can look up and she is
pointing to the man, to one of

8ef7ac7c-199e-4ee3-9eca-a385528c70c7-3
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.760
the boats.

415d932e-99d8-4e26-8005-d74911df8d0f-0
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.180
So then.

d4f8cdc1-3352-43be-9121-cc7937df2692-0
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.090
They are standing there
watching.

74ba169d-8716-4038-88f5-633e1ef33805-0
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.390
I haven't felt.

22a940ba-fa7a-4ebf-9d48-e2de39332bdc-0
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:46.972
They're watching all these boats
in the air, though. There is one

22a940ba-fa7a-4ebf-9d48-e2de39332bdc-1
00:19:46.972 --> 00:19:51.780
boat that she was pointing to
that comes closer and they are

22a940ba-fa7a-4ebf-9d48-e2de39332bdc-2
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.460
standing there and the boat
must.

edb21f22-9a2d-4da7-a3a0-a9b6dab26070-0
00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.529
Set down on the next to the
track for people to board and

edb21f22-9a2d-4da7-a3a0-a9b6dab26070-1
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:06.366
then the man follows the woman
along with the his little animal

edb21f22-9a2d-4da7-a3a0-a9b6dab26070-2
00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:11.930
friend and goes over and an
attendant looks like punches his

edb21f22-9a2d-4da7-a3a0-a9b6dab26070-3
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:17.950
ticket and tells him that he can
board this flying ship or boat. 

6da71d03-4fb4-4243-9783-7d6b519a8484-0
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.900
Cool.

dafc3a66-dc32-4776-8dde-f1a559d26820-0
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:32.833
So the man and his little animal
friend sit down on a bench next

dafc3a66-dc32-4776-8dde-f1a559d26820-1
00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:38.014
to the woman who in her little
animal friend is on her lap.

dafc3a66-dc32-4776-8dde-f1a559d26820-2
00:20:38.014 --> 00:20:43.368
There are other people that are
sitting around them, but they

dafc3a66-dc32-4776-8dde-f1a559d26820-3
00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:47.600
continue to have a conversation
with each other.

07ed7536-01b7-4726-85ff-2e12c93b7e22-0
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.760
And the woman?

86fe16bf-ade8-4705-8145-891f57aa8055-0
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:02.260
Perhaps ask the man a question
and he goes into his jacket

86fe16bf-ade8-4705-8145-891f57aa8055-1
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.930
pocket. He pulls out a piece of
paper.

3e3b3e63-ab47-40e8-8e31-85c587741980-0
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.750
And.

aa611cf3-c537-4a52-9fbf-83c304775178-0
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:17.420
Shows the woman what appears to
be something similar to.

3df9612f-2932-40c1-9518-8d8af3e68fe6-0
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.614
Like a passport, it has a photo
with some stamps and some

3df9612f-2932-40c1-9518-8d8af3e68fe6-1
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:27.001
information, but it's on the
it's in the form of just a piece

3df9612f-2932-40c1-9518-8d8af3e68fe6-2
00:21:27.001 --> 00:21:31.317
of paper. It's not in a booklet
like a a passport book, some

3df9612f-2932-40c1-9518-8d8af3e68fe6-3
00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:34.289
kind of identification with a
picture of.

18fa835f-7641-4f9a-850b-ac45423cd882-0
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:46.249
Some, I guess that is him. The
woman then says that she has one

18fa835f-7641-4f9a-850b-ac45423cd882-1
00:21:46.249 --> 00:21:54.633
as well and she reaches into her
bag and she pulls out a paper as

18fa835f-7641-4f9a-850b-ac45423cd882-2
00:21:54.633 --> 00:21:59.080
well with a young girl on it.
The.

09663909-6290-448c-9993-efab53fbc750-0
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:07.850
It looks as if maybe they are
searching for these people.

ea9a6485-fcd9-44f6-9f6c-7a387a9b5a66-0
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:14.917
Um, it then tells the story of
who this young girl is, and it

ea9a6485-fcd9-44f6-9f6c-7a387a9b5a66-1
00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:21.537
shows a different scene with the
picture, with this girl who's on

ea9a6485-fcd9-44f6-9f6c-7a387a9b5a66-2
00:22:21.537 --> 00:22:27.454
the picture of this paper
reading a book, and she looks as

ea9a6485-fcd9-44f6-9f6c-7a387a9b5a66-3
00:22:27.454 --> 00:22:32.970
if she's confined in some sort
of basement or dungeon.

dfce51f8-0bb5-4062-99ab-f5f94a9c9f7d-0
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.693
Uh, she is reading a book, and
there is a set of hands that

dfce51f8-0bb5-4062-99ab-f5f94a9c9f7d-1
00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:45.187
comes and grabs her, and she's
very, very frightened. She does

dfce51f8-0bb5-4062-99ab-f5f94a9c9f7d-2
00:22:45.187 --> 00:22:50.769
not want to go with whoever is
grabbing her. The the hands take

dfce51f8-0bb5-4062-99ab-f5f94a9c9f7d-3
00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:56.264
the book out of. They take the
book from the girl, they put it

dfce51f8-0bb5-4062-99ab-f5f94a9c9f7d-4
00:22:56.264 --> 00:23:01.584
away into a drawer, and they
unlock a there's like a padlock

dfce51f8-0bb5-4062-99ab-f5f94a9c9f7d-5
00:23:01.584 --> 00:23:04.550
that the hands unlock. They
then.

83fec1c5-1030-4b02-a8dd-af706fb83928-0
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:10.802
Take a a shovel and put it in
the girl's hands and instruct

83fec1c5-1030-4b02-a8dd-af706fb83928-1
00:23:10.802 --> 00:23:12.760
the girl to shovel.

06db459f-f228-491b-ba8f-cbe84767a400-0
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.720
Uh.

bbb1120d-f545-40a5-82f3-503ab4f9d3f7-0
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.339
I would assume maybe coal into
what looks to be some kind of a

bbb1120d-f545-40a5-82f3-503ab4f9d3f7-1
00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:26.534
furnace. It's like a furnace
type structure and there's

bbb1120d-f545-40a5-82f3-503ab4f9d3f7-2
00:23:26.534 --> 00:23:30.953
around opening that has what
appears to be fire and she is

bbb1120d-f545-40a5-82f3-503ab4f9d3f7-3
00:23:30.953 --> 00:23:34.250
shoveling I guess maybe coal
into the fire.

504c8028-1a14-4ca9-9baa-44305fa22b2c-0
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.956
Not willingly being forced to do
this. When she does that,

504c8028-1a14-4ca9-9baa-44305fa22b2c-1
00:23:39.956 --> 00:23:44.589
obviously smoke comes out and
kind of blows in her face and

504c8028-1a14-4ca9-9baa-44305fa22b2c-2
00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:49.145
she then has to climb up on a
ladder, the top part of this

504c8028-1a14-4ca9-9baa-44305fa22b2c-3
00:23:49.145 --> 00:23:53.469
furnace, and she sticks
something down the top chimney.

e54b1416-3377-4911-aabb-e5459f15fdb5-0
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.391
Uh, type thing that's on the top
of this furnace. I don't know

e54b1416-3377-4911-aabb-e5459f15fdb5-1
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:02.936
what that is. I don't know if
she's pushing something down or

e54b1416-3377-4911-aabb-e5459f15fdb5-2
00:24:02.936 --> 00:24:03.680
cleaning it. 

5075a296-dd7e-4439-8d3b-44ec10c8751e-0
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.400
Yeah.

68734be7-5f54-4683-903e-5b06d98360d3-0
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:14.540
Am I doing OK so far? This is
weird. OK, OK, OK all right.

84aca559-b472-43b4-93f2-492cba4a3f84-0
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:22.653
So now we get a bigger picture
of the girl on top of the she

84aca559-b472-43b4-93f2-492cba4a3f84-1
00:24:22.653 --> 00:24:28.037
where she's climbed up to like
the chimney on top of this

84aca559-b472-43b4-93f2-492cba4a3f84-2
00:24:28.037 --> 00:24:31.380
furnace, and we see that she is
in.

d63b24cd-d3f9-4dc5-bf5a-ee87be5ff3be-0
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.790
She is in just one small little
cubicle.

fb84535e-017c-4192-86f1-45050c0a7369-0
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.838
Where there are next to her and
across from her other little

fb84535e-017c-4192-86f1-45050c0a7369-1
00:24:43.838 --> 00:24:48.400
cell. Or maybe a cell. Not a
cubicle, but other little cells.

d316fd4c-02d1-4645-9a7f-770b0d293de8-0
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:55.710
Where each cell has this same
furnace with the same chimney,

d316fd4c-02d1-4645-9a7f-770b0d293de8-1
00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:01.838
and each cell also has a young
girl in each in each one that is

d316fd4c-02d1-4645-9a7f-770b0d293de8-2
00:25:01.838 --> 00:25:08.062
shoveling coal into the furnace.
So this is a very big some kind

d316fd4c-02d1-4645-9a7f-770b0d293de8-3
00:25:08.062 --> 00:25:10.360
of a big industrialized.

7133ddf9-bd9d-46ae-9aae-0a1bc11e3e39-0
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.050
Camp or.

18b8b63b-9443-4bc0-8039-65b7a8ca6b80-0
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.825
Or building where there's lot
each each each little cell

18b8b63b-9443-4bc0-8039-65b7a8ca6b80-1
00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:25.500
block.

93a5c990-1e44-44fe-9dfd-00ba55d50b72-0
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:30.927
As a has one girl and 1:00
furnace in it and they're

93a5c990-1e44-44fe-9dfd-00ba55d50b72-1
00:25:30.927 --> 00:25:35.861
they're they're heating up the
furnaces. So then it shows her

93a5c990-1e44-44fe-9dfd-00ba55d50b72-2
00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:40.715
sitting on the floor crying.
She's just in like a white long

93a5c990-1e44-44fe-9dfd-00ba55d50b72-3
00:25:40.715 --> 00:25:45.490
white T-shirt. She's barefoot.
She has no other clothes on.

2b45e332-61c1-4bb2-8146-1f0424b70584-0
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:52.649
She is holding the she stands
up, she is holding the shovel

2b45e332-61c1-4bb2-8146-1f0424b70584-1
00:25:52.649 --> 00:25:58.518
and she looks at the door and
she decides that she's going to

2b45e332-61c1-4bb2-8146-1f0424b70584-2
00:25:58.518 --> 00:26:04.103
pry open the door with the
shovel to try to escape. She is

2b45e332-61c1-4bb2-8146-1f0424b70584-3
00:26:04.103 --> 00:26:06.470
able to open up the door.

41a4192e-c1c3-44a4-af5b-48254188eaa3-0
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.220
And she looks. She waits inside.

86be130f-7f26-4285-b1fa-ae50c538eecc-0
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.640
And then once the doors open,
she goes, she grabs.

614b5e13-ef9d-4e7e-91d3-c9ce65d38421-0
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.510
Uh.

43e5a7bd-ee9b-4b30-b7cf-48d7e25f640f-0
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.825
I don't know what she's grabbing
in that picture, but she

43e5a7bd-ee9b-4b30-b7cf-48d7e25f640f-1
00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:28.936
definitely goes and grabs her
book and then she leaves the

43e5a7bd-ee9b-4b30-b7cf-48d7e25f640f-2
00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:34.655
cell and she walks and she walks
out of whatever camp this is and

43e5a7bd-ee9b-4b30-b7cf-48d7e25f640f-3
00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:39.766
she is able to climb onto a
train like a a a train, one of

43e5a7bd-ee9b-4b30-b7cf-48d7e25f640f-4
00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:40.720
the little.

3cb5b1f8-f2ed-4032-955f-54499908f4ca-0
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.721
Carts box carts that goes on a
train. She's able to climb onto

3cb5b1f8-f2ed-4032-955f-54499908f4ca-1
00:26:47.721 --> 00:26:52.996
the cart onto the train and she
sits down and sets her book down

3cb5b1f8-f2ed-4032-955f-54499908f4ca-2
00:26:52.996 --> 00:26:58.351
and she's kind of huddled inside
of this cart and the train takes

3cb5b1f8-f2ed-4032-955f-54499908f4ca-3
00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:00.380
her away from this camp. 

56a44443-218d-4f6f-9733-18717e665a58-0
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.670
 Now we switch back to the man.

d6f66006-45e3-419e-8e20-2115638460d1-0
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:16.156
Um, and it shows this passenger
ship or boat, this flying

d6f66006-45e3-419e-8e20-2115638460d1-1
00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:19.850
passenger ship. Maybe it's a
steamship?

9d7aa926-0b6a-4aa9-9b8c-fade6c4ed5d3-0
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.148
And it shows it flying through.
It looks to what appears to be

9d7aa926-0b6a-4aa9-9b8c-fade6c4ed5d3-1
00:27:27.148 --> 00:27:32.542
some kind of a city flying into
a city. The man is still sitting

9d7aa926-0b6a-4aa9-9b8c-fade6c4ed5d3-2
00:27:32.542 --> 00:27:37.355
next to the woman with the
animals and she is pointing to

9d7aa926-0b6a-4aa9-9b8c-fade6c4ed5d3-3
00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:42.417
him. Then there is an attendant
who has like a megaphone who

9d7aa926-0b6a-4aa9-9b8c-fade6c4ed5d3-4
00:27:42.417 --> 00:27:47.728
makes an announcement. Must be
for the stop, and the ship docks

9d7aa926-0b6a-4aa9-9b8c-fade6c4ed5d3-5
00:27:47.728 --> 00:27:50.550
on another next to another
track.

9b766571-ba8c-4c70-94aa-4752b563cd12-0
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.050
And the man?

0891a51e-624a-429a-b8f5-0a5a3ba1e972-0
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:59.130
Shakes maybe shakes the hand of
the woman and thanks her for her

0891a51e-624a-429a-b8f5-0a5a3ba1e972-1
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:04.654
assistance, and the man and his
little animal walk away. They

0891a51e-624a-429a-b8f5-0a5a3ba1e972-2
00:28:04.654 --> 00:28:10.089
get up, they walk away and exit
off of the ship. And then it

0891a51e-624a-429a-b8f5-0a5a3ba1e972-3
00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:15.167
shows the man standing at the
top of a stairway, kind of

0891a51e-624a-429a-b8f5-0a5a3ba1e972-4
00:28:15.167 --> 00:28:20.334
looking down into the center
part of this little city. It

0891a51e-624a-429a-b8f5-0a5a3ba1e972-5
00:28:20.334 --> 00:28:23.720
shows other there's little
stairways.

93bb0980-c31d-46e9-b290-1f163104f1cb-0
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.280
It's, it's not flat.

d60f3f63-7ae7-441c-8639-7202bfe177c6-0
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.560
It's got little.

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-0
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:34.222
Stairways, almost very European,
like almost kind of like Greece,

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-1
00:28:34.222 --> 00:28:38.958
the way that you would have like
stairs that kind of go up and

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-2
00:28:38.958 --> 00:28:43.545
down the little cities on the
hillsides, like in Greece. But

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-3
00:28:43.545 --> 00:28:48.356
it's not Greece. There's other
people that appear to be kind of

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-4
00:28:48.356 --> 00:28:53.093
walking, not a lot, but other
people that appear to be walking

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-5
00:28:53.093 --> 00:28:57.604
on different paths and at the
center part of the city there

10d9dcdb-94b5-478c-987e-aa4d073ccced-6
00:28:57.604 --> 00:28:57.830
is.

088039cc-d958-456a-bf0f-e1d644c060d9-0
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.412
A large animal, a very large
animal that is holding a bowl of

088039cc-d958-456a-bf0f-e1d644c060d9-1
00:29:04.412 --> 00:29:09.266
some, maybe some fruit, some
different shapes, and that's at

088039cc-d958-456a-bf0f-e1d644c060d9-2
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:14.278
the center of the city. I cannot
tell if it's a structure or a

088039cc-d958-456a-bf0f-e1d644c060d9-3
00:29:14.278 --> 00:29:18.814
real animal, but it's very
large, very large inside. And

088039cc-d958-456a-bf0f-e1d644c060d9-4
00:29:18.814 --> 00:29:23.667
the man is standing at the top
of the stairs kind of looking

088039cc-d958-456a-bf0f-e1d644c060d9-5
00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:28.680
down on all of this in the city
with his little animal friend.

9c8f2cdf-329d-43e9-81bb-087ea2bf75d7-0
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.650
Next to him. 

491f3f8c-28d5-4bd1-9ec0-f6d474c0a3f3-0
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.410
OK.

1e17da27-74f4-456a-8586-552a5a0adc25-0
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:41.550
1 So the man and the animal,
they they continue to walk.

e25216cc-9d74-4767-8575-49aee37d05f9-0
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.240
Um, they're walking now on a
lower part of the city, and

e25216cc-9d74-4767-8575-49aee37d05f9-1
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.760
there's more people around
walking.

7c5ff34c-6939-4d92-ba06-67bf9ebd57df-0
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.370
You know, buy them or standing
by them.

ec808743-3777-4dbb-b76b-4314175c46a9-0
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.290
There are two men.

9bd01d3d-6206-41b1-b82e-288f0e9be9ac-0
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:03.428
Who are having a conversation
off on one side there is a woman

9bd01d3d-6206-41b1-b82e-288f0e9be9ac-1
00:30:03.428 --> 00:30:08.420
that goes it must be cold
because she has on a hat and a

9bd01d3d-6206-41b1-b82e-288f0e9be9ac-2
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.450
scarf and a coat. She goes to
some kind of a.

382351b1-b275-4682-9d54-bd6cbdd0416a-0
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.116
Maybe like a machine? Like a
self-service vending type of

382351b1-b275-4682-9d54-bd6cbdd0416a-1
00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:20.300
machine. Um, and there's a A.

e6fc136a-1a13-496e-941a-7c373f143cca-0
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.680
Compartment that is open.

ec0deb5e-fdd9-4c3c-8e0f-adf995cd23ae-0
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:29.940
And she is either putting
something in or taking something

ec0deb5e-fdd9-4c3c-8e0f-adf995cd23ae-1
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.715
out. There's also two men and
older man who is looking at what

ec0deb5e-fdd9-4c3c-8e0f-adf995cd23ae-2
00:30:34.715 --> 00:30:39.413
appears to be a fish in some
kind of a box that maybe another

ec0deb5e-fdd9-4c3c-8e0f-adf995cd23ae-3
00:30:39.413 --> 00:30:40.550
man is selling.

d4d00088-4af9-4460-86ad-c95e1e7dad12-0
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.381
So the man in this, his little
animal friend, are walking

d4d00088-4af9-4460-86ad-c95e1e7dad12-1
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:52.409
along. He has this book that
perhaps, maybe the woman gave

d4d00088-4af9-4460-86ad-c95e1e7dad12-2
00:30:52.409 --> 00:30:52.750
him.

7c9bdc90-dbc6-4a1a-b7d6-dcc302090f67-0
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.560
And the book? When the book is
open, it looks as if he can.

eb08524c-ae1d-4239-ae55-7426c227e377-0
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:05.565
Has pictures of like an apple,
maybe a a glass, like a jar of

eb08524c-ae1d-4239-ae55-7426c227e377-1
00:31:05.565 --> 00:31:06.020
milk.

67e4989e-28c7-491d-b745-72bcbc0227ca-0
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:12.462
Wedge of cheese, a loaf of
bread. Fish looks like some food

67e4989e-28c7-491d-b745-72bcbc0227ca-1
00:31:12.462 --> 00:31:17.476
items, and perhaps it has the
name and the price of what they

67e4989e-28c7-491d-b745-72bcbc0227ca-2
00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:17.800
are.

93e45576-b6d8-400d-97db-4a7134ff0976-0
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:24.723
The little animal friend goes up
to a wall that has these

93e45576-b6d8-400d-97db-4a7134ff0976-1
00:31:24.723 --> 00:31:30.158
different compartments and
selects one of the compartments

93e45576-b6d8-400d-97db-4a7134ff0976-2
00:31:30.158 --> 00:31:35.962
and the man opens it up and it
appears to have in this drawer,

93e45576-b6d8-400d-97db-4a7134ff0976-3
00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:38.909
this little drawer it pulls out.

bb9acc2e-cb0e-4a48-af3b-0fd9203a3f13-0
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:45.057
Something that kind of looks
like a strawberry with like a

bb9acc2e-cb0e-4a48-af3b-0fd9203a3f13-1
00:31:45.057 --> 00:31:46.720
curvy little tail.

162207d4-f8bb-4fda-997a-7e3b4bf210b5-0
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:48.900
Um.

1cc5edba-816c-49ff-a700-7a632f35885c-0
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:56.121
The man then refers back to his
book and then picks one of these

1cc5edba-816c-49ff-a700-7a632f35885c-1
00:31:56.121 --> 00:32:00.630
little strawberry like things
out of the drawer.

644077af-1c10-42fc-b6ed-f1bedf60f4ad-0
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:07.083
Uh, or I'm sorry. There's a
little boy. There's a hand that

644077af-1c10-42fc-b6ed-f1bedf60f4ad-1
00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:11.440
pulls one of these little
strawberry things out of the

644077af-1c10-42fc-b6ed-f1bedf60f4ad-2
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.718
drawer, and it is that of a
young boy. And the boy is

644077af-1c10-42fc-b6ed-f1bedf60f4ad-3
00:32:15.718 --> 00:32:17.620
holding this strawberry.

b23700dc-7bd3-41d2-93be-2c9386e93ce1-0
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:25.530
To show the man, and there is an
older man that appears with the

b23700dc-7bd3-41d2-93be-2c9386e93ce1-1
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.820
boy and they're smiling and
waving. Umm, they appear to

b23700dc-7bd3-41d2-93be-2c9386e93ce1-2
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.494
offer the strawberry to the man
with the hat with his little

b23700dc-7bd3-41d2-93be-2c9386e93ce1-3
00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:39.167
animal friend. And he says no
thank you, that's not what I'm

b23700dc-7bd3-41d2-93be-2c9386e93ce1-4
00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:43.994
looking for. And he points to
the book to show them that he is

b23700dc-7bd3-41d2-93be-2c9386e93ce1-5
00:32:43.994 --> 00:32:46.140
looking for a loaf of bread.

44d1f3b9-c350-4002-92d0-4a195507c906-0
00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.890
He then shows.

ddb264f3-22d1-4178-b0fc-74623fff0ba9-0
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.330
Chose them that he wants.

442bbb46-5a95-404c-b8d5-1ba847171b5a-0
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.242
I don't know if he's showing
them his money or whether he's

442bbb46-5a95-404c-b8d5-1ba847171b5a-1
00:32:59.242 --> 00:33:03.616
trying to still show them that
he wants a loaf of bread like

442bbb46-5a95-404c-b8d5-1ba847171b5a-2
00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:07.775
sliced bread. So the what
appears to be the father of the

442bbb46-5a95-404c-b8d5-1ba847171b5a-3
00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:12.365
little boy, he goes over to the
this little wall or machine and

442bbb46-5a95-404c-b8d5-1ba847171b5a-4
00:33:12.365 --> 00:33:16.309
he points to a different
compartment and he opens that

442bbb46-5a95-404c-b8d5-1ba847171b5a-5
00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:18.030
door and out he grabs a.

e6211ac4-9d2e-444e-8465-4acda0206a27-0
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:28.387
I don't know what that is. It's,
uh, it's almost like a gourd.

e6211ac4-9d2e-444e-8465-4acda0206a27-1
00:33:28.387 --> 00:33:33.216
Maybe like a gourd where the
tail like rather than ending,

e6211ac4-9d2e-444e-8465-4acda0206a27-2
00:33:33.216 --> 00:33:36.000
the tail curls underneath
itself.

1cfca249-c2ad-4bb0-afff-cfbe50b7224f-0
00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:42.855
And he holds this out smiling,
showing the man. The man then

1cfca249-c2ad-4bb0-afff-cfbe50b7224f-1
00:33:42.855 --> 00:33:48.556
has it in his hands and it
appears as if he is maybe taking

1cfca249-c2ad-4bb0-afff-cfbe50b7224f-2
00:33:48.556 --> 00:33:54.637
a bite of the gourd and then the
little boy is holding an empty

1cfca249-c2ad-4bb0-afff-cfbe50b7224f-3
00:33:54.637 --> 00:34:00.243
basket this this wide empty
basket. The man then puts this

1cfca249-c2ad-4bb0-afff-cfbe50b7224f-4
00:34:00.243 --> 00:34:06.134
gourd like thing in the basket
and carries it and proceeds to

1cfca249-c2ad-4bb0-afff-cfbe50b7224f-5
00:34:06.134 --> 00:34:06.990
walk off.

0295a3d7-d2d2-4e19-8062-6b3cfc20f9cf-0
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.320
With the man and his son while
they're talking. 

5850f1f3-d226-4d6b-a20f-b58dc52a7a8e-0
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.152
 Then the father of the boy
pulls out from another

5850f1f3-d226-4d6b-a20f-b58dc52a7a8e-1
00:34:25.152 --> 00:34:26.280
compartment.

12c11858-9863-4c95-af75-ee228a82104c-0
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:33.154
Uh, something that kind of looks
like a shrimp. And he's holding

12c11858-9863-4c95-af75-ee228a82104c-1
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:38.685
this, uh, this shrimp in his
hand. The boy is then holding a

12c11858-9863-4c95-af75-ee228a82104c-2
00:34:38.685 --> 00:34:43.310
another item that he grabs out
of the compartment.

51b893a1-c9d3-476e-8722-f76f26a7c2db-0
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:51.239
And I'm oh, this is hard. It's
kind of it's long. It's long and

51b893a1-c9d3-476e-8722-f76f26a7c2db-1
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:55.274
narrow, kind of like the shape
of like a trumpet, like the way

51b893a1-c9d3-476e-8722-f76f26a7c2db-2
00:34:55.274 --> 00:34:56.940
that it flares at the end.

196510de-cf88-43bb-9233-98512b1b8b68-0
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.638
And and then it flashes back to
the father, opening a different

196510de-cf88-43bb-9233-98512b1b8b68-1
00:35:02.638 --> 00:35:06.130
drawer and pulling out some kind
of a little.

bb28517f-88e9-4416-b206-beb689355ed5-0
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.063
Bush, uh, of some sort has
leaves, but they're they're

bb28517f-88e9-4416-b206-beb689355ed5-1
00:35:13.063 --> 00:35:16.210
tight together, kind of like an
artichoke.

6479dc97-44ad-4a8e-9e96-77c7352ee011-0
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.407
Then the boy is holding what
appears to kind of be a like a

6479dc97-44ad-4a8e-9e96-77c7352ee011-1
00:35:22.407 --> 00:35:26.991
big strawberry. Like very large.
He's got his arms wrapped around

6479dc97-44ad-4a8e-9e96-77c7352ee011-2
00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:27.200
it.

decd35c7-22ef-40f5-ac7a-b6f95261cbd2-0
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.330
And then it shows a different
item that they're holding.

04d8204b-f938-44f6-aded-b37442dfb1da-0
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.415
Something that has these little
like maybe tentacles, kind of

04d8204b-f938-44f6-aded-b37442dfb1da-1
00:35:39.415 --> 00:35:43.680
like an octopus coming out of
it. The father is then holding.

d1a12b14-7f2a-4d24-8c62-db843abc7bf7-0
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.618
Something that is long and
striped, almost kind of like a

d1a12b14-7f2a-4d24-8c62-db843abc7bf7-1
00:35:50.618 --> 00:35:55.168
snake, but it doesn't have an
animal head. I believe it's some

d1a12b14-7f2a-4d24-8c62-db843abc7bf7-2
00:35:55.168 --> 00:35:59.862
kind of food that you would eat,
has kind of like a rounded bulb

d1a12b14-7f2a-4d24-8c62-db843abc7bf7-3
00:35:59.862 --> 00:36:00.440
bubbler.

af022083-d2d9-41ac-8b6e-d77530590531-0
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:01.970
Umm.

a4b37de3-1223-4388-99a5-56e3a034ab2e-0
00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:09.586
I don't know what the heck that
is. It it does kind of cut off

a4b37de3-1223-4388-99a5-56e3a034ab2e-1
00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:11.840
on there, then the dad pulls
out.

857391c5-4699-452c-a974-564a3f6a17bb-0
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.710
Kind of looks like a fish with
spikes.

03e899f0-753c-4e26-8403-7081a73dc4c7-0
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.620
Um, and they cut open.

78fa71e5-fd82-4d4b-a503-529ff2d21e49-0
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.710
Some kind of gourd or cucumber
kind of similar thing. He cuts,

78fa71e5-fd82-4d4b-a503-529ff2d21e49-1
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.844
he must cut it or open it in
half and he offers it to the

78fa71e5-fd82-4d4b-a503-529ff2d21e49-2
00:36:30.844 --> 00:36:31.130
man.

903c64b6-07dc-4470-b683-bdda01ac9a7e-0
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.580
The little boy is eating the.

013c39e7-133f-4281-8c4b-80e06f8d01d5-0
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:40.135
Initial strawberry like thinking
with the curved tail, he begins

013c39e7-133f-4281-8c4b-80e06f8d01d5-1
00:36:40.135 --> 00:36:44.048
to eat that and then the man
with the hat takes a bite of

013c39e7-133f-4281-8c4b-80e06f8d01d5-2
00:36:44.048 --> 00:36:47.490
this cucumber like thing that
the father gave him.

cf143e2b-472f-459b-9e8d-958207dfcaf9-0
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.390
And tries that.

d605f1bd-bac4-4c99-9201-28977143d0b5-0
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:55.704
The boy then gives a piece of
his food to the man's little

d605f1bd-bac4-4c99-9201-28977143d0b5-1
00:36:55.704 --> 00:37:00.540
animal friend to feed him, and
the man takes all of the

d605f1bd-bac4-4c99-9201-28977143d0b5-2
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.290
different things that they took
from the compartments.

d5d08428-e7a5-4f3c-9017-0d0a070da01b-0
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.250
In the basket. He is carrying
them in the basket.

cfe63acf-d59f-43de-b347-8db6e45f2047-0
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:17.109
The father, or I'm sorry, the
boy whispered something to his

cfe63acf-d59f-43de-b347-8db6e45f2047-1
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:19.670
father, and then the father.

dee76164-6864-4700-befa-6674ae1cdc8e-0
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.957
Smiles and puts his arm around
the man, each of them both

dee76164-6864-4700-befa-6674ae1cdc8e-1
00:37:24.957 --> 00:37:29.734
carrying a basket filled with
different foods. And then the

dee76164-6864-4700-befa-6674ae1cdc8e-2
00:37:29.734 --> 00:37:34.829
boy is carrying a basket of food
and he is pointing down to the

dee76164-6864-4700-befa-6674ae1cdc8e-3
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:38.730
ships that are a little further
down below them.

14ce9b9e-76d2-4076-b01c-828d709f8830-0
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.016
And then we see a picture of
down below, looking at the

14ce9b9e-76d2-4076-b01c-828d709f8830-1
00:37:45.016 --> 00:37:50.437
ships, kind of looking up at
this city from the center part,

14ce9b9e-76d2-4076-b01c-828d709f8830-2
00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:55.769
kind of looking up the hill, and
the two men and the animal

14ce9b9e-76d2-4076-b01c-828d709f8830-3
00:37:55.769 --> 00:38:01.190
friend and the little boy are
walking in towards the ships. 

f9424df5-844d-4f97-a155-3977aca31b13-0
00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:04.740
OK.

81f85c19-5978-48da-ad9a-912f078c045a-0
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.995
Umm, let's see. The boy,
carrying a basket along with the

81f85c19-5978-48da-ad9a-912f078c045a-1
00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:17.891
little animal, heads to one of
the ships where there is like

81f85c19-5978-48da-ad9a-912f078c045a-2
00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:22.706
some kind of a vase, like a
ceramic pot vase. He then waves

81f85c19-5978-48da-ad9a-912f078c045a-3
00:38:22.706 --> 00:38:27.843
them on and sets his basket down
on the ship. And inside of the

81f85c19-5978-48da-ad9a-912f078c045a-4
00:38:27.843 --> 00:38:32.579
vase you can tell there's a
little tail of some sort. It's

81f85c19-5978-48da-ad9a-912f078c045a-5
00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:35.950
so it's a long, curvy, spiky
little tail.

c7ff1eda-17f2-4796-9840-84f98a519c3a-0
00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:41.957
And he's showing the man with
the hat. And the man in the hat

c7ff1eda-17f2-4796-9840-84f98a519c3a-1
00:38:41.957 --> 00:38:47.224
drops his basket and the the
food kind of on top of the boat.

c7ff1eda-17f2-4796-9840-84f98a519c3a-2
00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:52.492
And it startled by what is in
this vase. And the boy giggles.

c7ff1eda-17f2-4796-9840-84f98a519c3a-3
00:38:52.492 --> 00:38:57.419
And the father comes over, puts
his arm around the man to

c7ff1eda-17f2-4796-9840-84f98a519c3a-4
00:38:57.419 --> 00:39:02.516
reassure him that everything is
OK. And then he says, look,

c7ff1eda-17f2-4796-9840-84f98a519c3a-5
00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:06.339
look. And the boy pulls out a
little animal.

9f8e74d0-d957-4a5a-bbdc-9f60d2743fa5-0
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.380
Maybe his pet that kind of looks
like.

01f68cf4-5bed-4f02-a1c5-10833d5510d8-0
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:17.274
Like a fox or a cat, it's got
dark eyes, it's got dark ears,

01f68cf4-5bed-4f02-a1c5-10833d5510d8-1
00:39:17.274 --> 00:39:22.651
and the top part of its head is
dark, but it has white coloring

01f68cf4-5bed-4f02-a1c5-10833d5510d8-2
00:39:22.651 --> 00:39:25.760
along the sides and around its
eyes.

26bb7513-d072-4f47-a67d-f863fbce8622-0
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:30.693
And so is it was the tail of
this little animal that was

26bb7513-d072-4f47-a67d-f863fbce8622-1
00:39:30.693 --> 00:39:34.992
sticking out of the vase. So the
animal looks friendly. The

26bb7513-d072-4f47-a67d-f863fbce8622-2
00:39:34.992 --> 00:39:39.649
little boy is holding the animal
and he goes over to the man and

26bb7513-d072-4f47-a67d-f863fbce8622-3
00:39:39.649 --> 00:39:44.020
the animal kind of peers in
towards the man, and they decide

26bb7513-d072-4f47-a67d-f863fbce8622-4
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:48.605
to put this little animal down
next to the man's animal so that

26bb7513-d072-4f47-a67d-f863fbce8622-5
00:39:48.605 --> 00:39:51.399
they can say hello and get
acquainted.

6f0b27ed-8cdf-4035-887e-557b6d431fe2-0
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:58.369
Um, the so the animals kind of
look at each other and say hi.

6f0b27ed-8cdf-4035-887e-557b6d431fe2-1
00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:04.387
Then the father and the man pick
up all of the things that fell

6f0b27ed-8cdf-4035-887e-557b6d431fe2-2
00:40:04.387 --> 00:40:06.080
out of the basket.

22f327a7-bfd7-48a4-85b9-4c3e4aeee4da-0
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.600
And the man says to the father.

070df641-b0b6-4f65-8ed5-98834b6efc5b-0
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.766
Maybe says I'm sorry and the
father says no, don't worry

070df641-b0b6-4f65-8ed5-98834b6efc5b-1
00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:18.830
about it. The man then looks up.

d447c8e1-76dd-4db0-aafa-10045e4f41dc-0
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.627
And pulls out his book and he
starts to draw inside of the

d447c8e1-76dd-4db0-aafa-10045e4f41dc-1
00:40:24.627 --> 00:40:26.070
book and he draws.

dc726570-cddb-4b78-b04c-507b7b2a9e3d-0
00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.940
Some houses.

2ce0fc43-31fc-4662-b219-963908b1bcbf-0
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.811
And then above the houses, he
draws a tail that is very

2ce0fc43-31fc-4662-b219-963908b1bcbf-1
00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:37.832
similar to the tail of this
little animal that belongs to

2ce0fc43-31fc-4662-b219-963908b1bcbf-2
00:40:37.832 --> 00:40:41.090
the little boy, and he shows it
to the father.

f1b43ec7-193c-40f7-94f0-d4b470245910-0
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.880
And then the father.

a51c509a-1a1e-4d6c-a53d-0e1870b0473c-0
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.210
Uh.

c246f6c7-d14b-41cd-8228-263537fecda5-0
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:53.360
The father kind of has maybe
like a puzzled look, like a.

4faa30d9-49c4-4188-940c-fcd6b183addd-0
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.677
Like a quizzical look on his
face. I'm not sure. I'd maybe

4faa30d9-49c4-4188-940c-fcd6b183addd-1
00:40:58.677 --> 00:41:02.308
when we get to the next page
I'll be able to tell what's

4faa30d9-49c4-4188-940c-fcd6b183addd-2
00:41:02.308 --> 00:41:06.066
going on. But the father is
looking up with his, his hands

4faa30d9-49c4-4188-940c-fcd6b183addd-3
00:41:06.066 --> 00:41:10.142
kind of out in front of him, and
he's looking at something very

4faa30d9-49c4-4188-940c-fcd6b183addd-4
00:41:10.142 --> 00:41:14.218
bright. You can see in his eye
the reflection of something very

4faa30d9-49c4-4188-940c-fcd6b183addd-5
00:41:14.218 --> 00:41:15.620
bright. #END_arrival_4

44ca521f-2938-42a2-afa8-0bf7420c70e1-0
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:24.593
OK, so that was that part of the
story, why don't we, OK who 5

44ca521f-2938-42a2-afa8-0bf7420c70e1-1
00:41:24.593 --> 00:41:29.680
minute break OK until 7:25 and
then we'll at 8, OK.

b978b1d9-103b-4a19-9cd5-63221b0fadf5-0
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.490
Cool. That is fine, yeah.

b02a163c-68bd-40c2-9760-ff6b4d24e784-0
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.530
OK.

57c59c60-1e39-4bcc-a9a6-07e1cb027027-0
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.990
OK, so.

f2b23faf-0d71-46ec-9bc0-40dac0b4c614-0
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.789
This is the next part of the
story. OK. It's not necessarily

f2b23faf-0d71-46ec-9bc0-40dac0b4c614-1
00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:54.440
in order, but in order, OK.

65097269-bbdc-4e70-b7dc-a01c5393c4fb-0
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.700
#START_arrival_2 So we now have
a scene of.

4a088ad4-e9b3-4f25-9a75-933667f46e37-0
00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.480
Would appears to be people.

60c282c3-0b65-422c-afe1-369e7110f790-0
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:12.190
Perhaps on one of these steam
flying steam ships?

a3249ad8-d95e-4092-9c74-d177fed897af-0
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.250
Uh, the people have.

89d3daba-6fe5-4ca1-8549-7d5960f91fab-0
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.578
Some kind of scarf or shawl
that's kind of draped over their

89d3daba-6fe5-4ca1-8549-7d5960f91fab-1
00:42:22.578 --> 00:42:22.960
head.

1e96dd49-e0b2-4742-b735-e2d571a49346-0
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.560
They are sitting next to their
luggage.

80949f8b-b82b-48c7-820a-371341923c5a-0
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:35.863
Maybe I'm thinking, maybe it's
women. Maybe it's women dressed

80949f8b-b82b-48c7-820a-371341923c5a-1
00:42:35.863 --> 00:42:42.268
with some kind of head covering.
And then there are three men who

80949f8b-b82b-48c7-820a-371341923c5a-2
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:47.993
are in suits wearing hats that
appear to be sitting either

80949f8b-b82b-48c7-820a-371341923c5a-3
00:42:47.993 --> 00:42:53.816
across from them or next to
them. There's a woman who has a

80949f8b-b82b-48c7-820a-371341923c5a-4
00:42:53.816 --> 00:42:57.310
baby in her arms. There is the
man.

99a031c9-f95b-4354-b996-c5f76935c7b7-0
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:01.220
I believe this system, man.

44cdd4e7-366d-490a-89b9-fa601aec8bde-0
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:08.088
From that we were watching
before. He is sitting on top of

44cdd4e7-366d-490a-89b9-fa601aec8bde-1
00:43:08.088 --> 00:43:14.072
his luggage with his his book or
his his book of blank paper, and

44cdd4e7-366d-490a-89b9-fa601aec8bde-2
00:43:14.072 --> 00:43:19.240
he's writing something in the
book. And then he writes a

44cdd4e7-366d-490a-89b9-fa601aec8bde-3
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.951
message on a piece of paper. He
tears the page out of the book

44cdd4e7-366d-490a-89b9-fa601aec8bde-4
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:30.572
and he begins to fold the paper
into origami and he folds the

44cdd4e7-366d-490a-89b9-fa601aec8bde-5
00:43:30.572 --> 00:43:31.570
paper into.

46e20b57-dbf0-4770-8668-a62b5d0f04ec-0
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:38.390
Like a crane crane origami. He
then holds the origami up in his

46e20b57-dbf0-4770-8668-a62b5d0f04ec-1
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:43.903
hand and he hears something and
he turns around or maybe he's

46e20b57-dbf0-4770-8668-a62b5d0f04ec-2
00:43:43.903 --> 00:43:49.505
waiting for the for the plane to
to to come. He then turns his

46e20b57-dbf0-4770-8668-a62b5d0f04ec-3
00:43:49.505 --> 00:43:55.107
his head around and looks back.
He picks he stands up, holding

46e20b57-dbf0-4770-8668-a62b5d0f04ec-4
00:43:55.107 --> 00:43:59.020
the book in the origami and his
other hand.

eab69244-f5d5-4dac-8abb-feacdac89233-0
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.510
And then he.

c5a63a62-b746-4d44-a84e-97090d57e89b-0
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:12.519
I don't know. I'm confused as to
whether that's him or whether

c5a63a62-b746-4d44-a84e-97090d57e89b-1
00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:17.641
that's one of the boys. But then
we see the man, a closer shot of

c5a63a62-b746-4d44-a84e-97090d57e89b-2
00:44:17.641 --> 00:44:22.453
his face, and he is looking up.
The sun is shining down, it's

c5a63a62-b746-4d44-a84e-97090d57e89b-3
00:44:22.453 --> 00:44:27.342
bright. So he's looking up with
his hand over his eyes so that

c5a63a62-b746-4d44-a84e-97090d57e89b-4
00:44:27.342 --> 00:44:31.921
he can see. And we see a close
up of people on this flying

c5a63a62-b746-4d44-a84e-97090d57e89b-5
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:34.250
steamship standing around and.

ee06221c-7bfd-452c-b618-cd0a1a461f64-0
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.660
There are these insects that are
flying over them.

0fd25f57-a2cc-49e3-b497-71d3cbe37d82-0
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.000
The insects appear to.

aaab18e2-f3dc-4d79-9eff-74c572fab71f-0
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:49.448
Be similar to in shape. Be
similar in shape to that of the

aaab18e2-f3dc-4d79-9eff-74c572fab71f-1
00:44:49.448 --> 00:44:55.226
dragonfly with but the. But as
you get closer you see that it

aaab18e2-f3dc-4d79-9eff-74c572fab71f-2
00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:59.980
is different than a dragonfly.
It's almost like a.

bbc99170-5e6f-4481-943e-95c77acaefd4-0
00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.959
1/3 of a plate like a porcelain
style plate for the wings and

bbc99170-5e6f-4481-943e-95c77acaefd4-1
00:45:05.959 --> 00:45:07.430
then it has a very.

9c97a003-f0ef-4ccc-afe5-bc7f0ca09cc0-0
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.680
Very narrow, pointed.

b3f1ef94-6631-4818-bcb8-a49eb457e012-0
00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.187
Head and beak with an eye and
there's all of these things are

b3f1ef94-6631-4818-bcb8-a49eb457e012-1
00:45:17.187 --> 00:45:22.087
just flying over these people.
There's a a swarm of them flying

b3f1ef94-6631-4818-bcb8-a49eb457e012-2
00:45:22.087 --> 00:45:26.911
over this this flying boat, and
the people are all standing up

b3f1ef94-6631-4818-bcb8-a49eb457e012-3
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:30.280
and looking at these things fly
over them. 

baec8b91-f6ab-4924-8184-440bd3881c49-0
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:32.350
It's.

c57b54af-51e0-45ab-8c56-e1597d151fb8-0
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:47.788
 OK, so now we see from a
different view, but above the

c57b54af-51e0-45ab-8c56-e1597d151fb8-1
00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:53.030
people standing on this flying
steamship.

391096ae-abf2-4b37-b217-8e471e9cbb5f-0
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:59.087
We can see off in the distance
that they are approaching a

391096ae-abf2-4b37-b217-8e471e9cbb5f-1
00:45:59.087 --> 00:46:04.172
different city and there's tall
skyscrapers and buildings in

391096ae-abf2-4b37-b217-8e471e9cbb5f-2
00:46:04.172 --> 00:46:08.923
this city. They're also in
between the ship and the city

391096ae-abf2-4b37-b217-8e471e9cbb5f-3
00:46:08.923 --> 00:46:14.341
port. There are other boats and
ships that are out on the water,

391096ae-abf2-4b37-b217-8e471e9cbb5f-4
00:46:14.341 --> 00:46:19.675
some of them small, kind of like
sailboat type boats, some kind

391096ae-abf2-4b37-b217-8e471e9cbb5f-5
00:46:19.675 --> 00:46:23.759
of medium size and others look
like big massive.

6c51285e-659e-4b51-97ff-9458ab5d857f-0
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:29.811
Um, ships that are out just
outside of the city in the water

6c51285e-659e-4b51-97ff-9458ab5d857f-1
00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:34.600
and then from a different angle
we can see this.

a3253e48-08df-4d4f-9bfe-bfaa5d320a63-0
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:41.486
Steamboat that is on the water
and the people are are in still

a3253e48-08df-4d4f-9bfe-bfaa5d320a63-1
00:46:41.486 --> 00:46:46.970
in their flying Steamboat kind
of looking over down at the

a3253e48-08df-4d4f-9bfe-bfaa5d320a63-2
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:52.826
water where their Steamboat is,
but behind the Steamboat there

a3253e48-08df-4d4f-9bfe-bfaa5d320a63-3
00:46:52.826 --> 00:46:55.150
are these two very large.

68943b96-40d6-4fa1-a3a9-448da2de175d-0
00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:05.292
Statue there. There's two very
large boats and each boat is

68943b96-40d6-4fa1-a3a9-448da2de175d-1
00:47:05.292 --> 00:47:06.670
holding a man.

25186de7-754e-4ff2-8a2b-9f23d2e7c44c-0
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.946
Who has on it? Each one has a
different hat. One man is

25186de7-754e-4ff2-8a2b-9f23d2e7c44c-1
00:47:10.946 --> 00:47:13.898
holding an apple in one hand
with a little bird on his

25186de7-754e-4ff2-8a2b-9f23d2e7c44c-2
00:47:13.898 --> 00:47:16.100
shoulder. The other man appears
to have.

929e291b-1d99-4597-8a14-ce576ea8bb81-0
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:23.126
Either a like maybe a mouse in
one hand and the men are shaking

929e291b-1d99-4597-8a14-ce576ea8bb81-1
00:47:23.126 --> 00:47:28.463
hands and then inside of their
boat they have some luggage. The

929e291b-1d99-4597-8a14-ce576ea8bb81-2
00:47:28.463 --> 00:47:33.550
man with the mouse also has a
teacup, a basket with possibly

929e291b-1d99-4597-8a14-ce576ea8bb81-3
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:38.720
some food and a vase of some
sort. And then the other man has

929e291b-1d99-4597-8a14-ce576ea8bb81-4
00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.974
a cone, one of those cone shaped
buildings that had the little

929e291b-1d99-4597-8a14-ce576ea8bb81-5
00:47:43.974 --> 00:47:47.560
circular partial opening. He has
a teapot.

edbfbd96-7c42-4ee1-803a-fa7c575df988-0
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:52.578
And what appears to be like a
big just kind of like an ice

edbfbd96-7c42-4ee1-803a-fa7c575df988-1
00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:56.430
bucket. But he has that in his
ship and the men are.

4c853288-f468-4dd9-8c43-1cb090a6362d-0
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.923
Extending out their hands and
shaking hands with the cityscape

4c853288-f468-4dd9-8c43-1cb090a6362d-1
00:48:01.923 --> 00:48:02.750
behind them. 

d7fbc97d-c98f-4b2f-ad85-04cb374cc3bf-0
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:15.540
Now we move on to a different
view of.

a094fc23-92c1-4cb1-9b1a-e56a8586f4d8-0
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:24.046
 From the water up looking up at
this big flying ship that has

a094fc23-92c1-4cb1-9b1a-e56a8586f4d8-1
00:48:24.046 --> 00:48:30.802
now because it's gotten close to
the city has now touched down

a094fc23-92c1-4cb1-9b1a-e56a8586f4d8-2
00:48:30.802 --> 00:48:37.666
into the water and you can see
the swarm of those little dragon

a094fc23-92c1-4cb1-9b1a-e56a8586f4d8-3
00:48:37.666 --> 00:48:44.315
fly, insect lake or dragonfly
like insects that has has flown

a094fc23-92c1-4cb1-9b1a-e56a8586f4d8-4
00:48:44.315 --> 00:48:47.639
over the ship and they are now.

ad372e25-3753-4696-ae57-5f543610b2e7-0
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.521
Past the ship in front of it,
heading down towards the water

ad372e25-3753-4696-ae57-5f543610b2e7-1
00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:56.450
and you can see all of the
people out on on the ship

ad372e25-3753-4696-ae57-5f543610b2e7-2
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.490
looking over as they approach
this city.

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-0
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.995
Uh, when they get, when they
when the ship docks and they

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-1
00:49:04.995 --> 00:49:09.932
they get to that port, the ship
docks. You can see the man among

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-2
00:49:09.932 --> 00:49:14.641
other people, and you can see
the attendant has his megaphone

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-3
00:49:14.641 --> 00:49:19.578
and he is calling and making an
announcement that they are going

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-4
00:49:19.578 --> 00:49:24.135
to be opening the doors and
letting everybody off. And then

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-5
00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:28.921
you see them actually unlock the
gate to the ship. You see the

5f729382-e746-485e-908b-f045db13218e-6
00:49:28.921 --> 00:49:30.820
man grabbed his suitcase.

215a41e5-e733-48e2-8a84-de79c4804090-0
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:36.040
And along with the other
travellers on this ship, he

215a41e5-e733-48e2-8a84-de79c4804090-1
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.000
perceives to deboard this ship.

4c78491c-0655-46b7-a1d2-e606fa257e45-0
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.193
And then once they're off the
ship, there is a long line of

4c78491c-0655-46b7-a1d2-e606fa257e45-1
00:49:44.193 --> 00:49:47.694
all the travelers carrying their
luggage, and they're waiting.

4c78491c-0655-46b7-a1d2-e606fa257e45-2
00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:50.250
They're waiting for something.
#END_arrival_2

83c4b0d9-ee97-40f7-a7e2-adad55af3fd1-0
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.504
OK, this, as you can tell, it's
a different story, different

83c4b0d9-ee97-40f7-a7e2-adad55af3fd1-1
00:49:59.504 --> 00:50:02.220
story. OK all right, so now we.

7665cfdd-f8e1-460a-af5c-3f666f841d9d-0
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.570
Um, now we have a.

a3654c93-177a-4c31-83c5-114b512dc5ab-0
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.554
#START_flowerman A different
story. We have a pretty much

a3654c93-177a-4c31-83c5-114b512dc5ab-1
00:50:11.554 --> 00:50:16.299
black and white, also some kind
of illustration that's black and

a3654c93-177a-4c31-83c5-114b512dc5ab-2
00:50:16.299 --> 00:50:18.490
white. It's a little bit more.

8c4e916b-e39c-4dde-b273-a83a4c28a5bc-0
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.900
It does have little color
though, because the sky in this

8c4e916b-e39c-4dde-b273-a83a4c28a5bc-1
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:30.234
is kind of like a deep purple,
and then there are patches of a

8c4e916b-e39c-4dde-b273-a83a4c28a5bc-2
00:50:30.234 --> 00:50:35.398
lighter purple to illustrate
either light or clouds like off

8c4e916b-e39c-4dde-b273-a83a4c28a5bc-3
00:50:35.398 --> 00:50:36.330
in the sky.

f62cc9dd-d821-445e-8b33-9153322f15ba-0
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.789
But the and that's kind of at
the top part of the picture. The

f62cc9dd-d821-445e-8b33-9153322f15ba-1
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:43.030
rest of the picture is still
black and white.

34b71c5f-4c69-4975-b20e-99d77698bbf9-0
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:49.190
And we see in color a man what
appears to be in.

9b07004b-01ba-4e3f-80ed-d56b228b2333-0
00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.049
I can't tell if it's an older
man or an older woman, but we'll

9b07004b-01ba-4e3f-80ed-d56b228b2333-1
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:55.390
say an older man right now.

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-0
00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:01.766
Wearing a black, kind of like a
little Black Hat, an orange

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-1
00:51:01.766 --> 00:51:05.997
scarf and a green jacket. Looks
like he might be carrying

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-2
00:51:05.997 --> 00:51:10.227
something blue, maybe an
umbrella, and quite possibly has

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-3
00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:14.531
some luggage with him. And it
appears that he has a little

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-4
00:51:14.531 --> 00:51:18.835
animal, maybe a little dog
that's walking next to him, and

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-5
00:51:18.835 --> 00:51:23.284
he is. He has. There's a picture
at the bottom of the at the

61a904ab-0921-4ca1-ab57-1d2492ded299-6
00:51:23.284 --> 00:51:27.880
bottom of the picture there is a
car that has gone off of the.

be834336-dc11-44ca-b473-9e41ab180dad-0
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:33.070
Gravel, roadway and down, kind
of like an embankment into a

be834336-dc11-44ca-b473-9e41ab180dad-1
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.090
grassy area.

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-0
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:40.452
So the man has taken, we assume
that he was in that car, he has

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-1
00:51:40.452 --> 00:51:44.619
taken his belongings and this
little animal and they've

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-2
00:51:44.619 --> 00:51:49.307
traveled, they left, they got
out of the car, walked along the

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-3
00:51:49.307 --> 00:51:53.772
road and they are going over
like a little cobblestone type

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-4
00:51:53.772 --> 00:51:58.087
of bridge that has St lamps at
each each corner and he is

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-5
00:51:58.087 --> 00:52:02.478
heading down on the other side
of that bridge over to what

57fccd24-1c25-49e4-8e78-c6a2e9ecaeae-6
00:52:02.478 --> 00:52:03.520
appears to be.

7d81d307-e508-43ef-877e-85b6280fa53d-0
00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.950
A little a little city.

9d0be630-d389-44a3-8413-69a871583af7-0
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.045
Neighborhood. There's a Ferris
wheel in the back. There's a gas

9d0be630-d389-44a3-8413-69a871583af7-1
00:52:13.045 --> 00:52:17.396
station with an attendant there
and some buildings that look

9d0be630-d389-44a3-8413-69a871583af7-2
00:52:17.396 --> 00:52:21.818
like maybe houses or apartments,
as well as some other little

9d0be630-d389-44a3-8413-69a871583af7-3
00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:26.312
shops. And he's tonight time, so
he's heading over towards the

9d0be630-d389-44a3-8413-69a871583af7-4
00:52:26.312 --> 00:52:29.380
gas station on a different in a
different.

6c12dfcf-607a-4595-86bb-76745e4660ee-0
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:37.183
Scene there is kind of another
shot of this village. There is a

6c12dfcf-607a-4595-86bb-76745e4660ee-1
00:52:37.183 --> 00:52:42.305
bar, there is a truck parked
along this little St next to a

6c12dfcf-607a-4595-86bb-76745e4660ee-2
00:52:42.305 --> 00:52:47.427
bait shop. And there is another
man who seems to be walking

6c12dfcf-607a-4595-86bb-76745e4660ee-3
00:52:47.427 --> 00:52:50.329
along the sidewalk to this town.


36aebb69-453d-4d15-8496-8e157b3d62dc-0
00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:03.426
So again, it's dark outside. The
man makes his way into one of

36aebb69-453d-4d15-8496-8e157b3d62dc-1
00:53:03.426 --> 00:53:09.155
the streets, kind of lit by the
street street lights kind of

36aebb69-453d-4d15-8496-8e157b3d62dc-2
00:53:09.155 --> 00:53:11.410
guiding his way. And he.

e626f312-11c7-439d-8b36-08a4d05ce5b3-0
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.858
I don't know. I don't know if
that's a hotel or an apartment

e626f312-11c7-439d-8b36-08a4d05ce5b3-1
00:53:21.858 --> 00:53:23.840
or around the corner there are.

d8865755-73d2-468f-8fc2-2636fe4dd2ec-0
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:28.532
Maybe. I don't know if that's
maybe a man and a woman off

d8865755-73d2-468f-8fc2-2636fe4dd2ec-1
00:53:28.532 --> 00:53:31.250
around the corner and another
scene we see.

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-0
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.414
A different part of the town
where there's a cafe, people are

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-1
00:53:36.414 --> 00:53:40.659
inside the cafe. You can see in
through the windows. There's

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-2
00:53:40.659 --> 00:53:44.834
somebody outside the cafe, it
looks like possibly smoking a

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-3
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:48.940
cigarette. There's a man on a
motorcycle driving along the

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-4
00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:53.394
road, as well as a kid with the
backpack maybe walking down the

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-5
00:53:53.394 --> 00:53:57.917
sidewalk. There's also a man in
a truck and some people out on a

355de1a2-a656-4d8a-b227-7e2b01d58c44-6
00:53:57.917 --> 00:54:00.910
balcony and one of the adjacent
buildings.

e2bce724-063c-434e-aa59-8499945b6f04-0
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.070
Great.

b4bb502d-809d-4abb-9e34-afd44b0116ef-0
00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:13.478
So the man makes his way down
down the street to a small

b4bb502d-809d-4abb-9e34-afd44b0116ef-1
00:54:13.478 --> 00:54:19.439
little house. It's really kind
of like a very small house slash

b4bb502d-809d-4abb-9e34-afd44b0116ef-2
00:54:19.439 --> 00:54:23.910
shack. It's kind of old and
falling apart. The.

638ca8fe-e515-43d3-9d69-6cdded2de9bc-0
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.250
Shutters on the windows are
falling off.

31a44682-c88b-475d-981f-b4cf4502a386-0
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.855
It looks like maybe even there
aren't any windows in the front

31a44682-c88b-475d-981f-b4cf4502a386-1
00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:39.267
and it looks like it's maybe
vacant. There is a for sale

31a44682-c88b-475d-981f-b4cf4502a386-2
00:54:39.267 --> 00:54:43.910
sign. The grass is overgrown,
but the man makes his way and

31a44682-c88b-475d-981f-b4cf4502a386-3
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:48.090
stops at this little house that
appears to be vacant.

c56deea4-fb94-458e-8691-1892b01f6d6c-0
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.380
We also see a scene of.

c5d5dbcc-4883-4cce-882c-d21441ff4ecc-0
00:54:56.210 --> 00:55:00.416
Another part of the street with
people in their homes and

c5d5dbcc-4883-4cce-882c-d21441ff4ecc-1
00:55:00.416 --> 00:55:03.390
apartments, we can see into the
windows.

5b1a2c07-8051-41de-8c3e-effe240a1862-0
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.217
We see a woman carrying some
things into her front door, some

5b1a2c07-8051-41de-8c3e-effe240a1862-1
00:55:09.217 --> 00:55:10.090
people sitting.

e0736ea7-1f72-4d02-875d-c9c4f3a6b467-0
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:16.854
Uh, down on a wait. What? Used
to be a fountain, but there's no

e0736ea7-1f72-4d02-875d-c9c4f3a6b467-1
00:55:16.854 --> 00:55:22.367
water in there. It's almost as
if there's no kind of like

e0736ea7-1f72-4d02-875d-c9c4f3a6b467-2
00:55:22.367 --> 00:55:28.546
things have stopped working and
things are out, like not kept up

e0736ea7-1f72-4d02-875d-c9c4f3a6b467-3
00:55:28.546 --> 00:55:33.109
very well, not maintained, and
people are just.

bc9596af-4882-4ffe-b8c9-4c1545700b03-0
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.670
Kind of hanging out, it appears.
Yeah.

39bc4a65-7878-4547-ab7e-006ddb98c7ec-0
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.080
So the man.

25bfc807-ced4-4ef3-813f-04efe100d5ea-0
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:54.002
Stops at the house and we see
what appears to maybe be the

25bfc807-ced4-4ef3-813f-04efe100d5ea-1
00:55:54.002 --> 00:55:59.525
next day again. Black and white.
Everything's black and white.

25bfc807-ced4-4ef3-813f-04efe100d5ea-2
00:55:59.525 --> 00:56:04.872
Kind of not lively. People are
just kind of there. But we do

25bfc807-ced4-4ef3-813f-04efe100d5ea-3
00:56:04.872 --> 00:56:10.483
see from the sky that it is now
blue and there are white clouds

25bfc807-ced4-4ef3-813f-04efe100d5ea-4
00:56:10.483 --> 00:56:16.269
in there. So it's daytime and we
see the man in in the front yard

25bfc807-ced4-4ef3-813f-04efe100d5ea-5
00:56:16.269 --> 00:56:19.250
of this little house, and he
has.

f88e29df-f871-48af-b645-653c3f284a97-0
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.301
The house has now turned from
black and white to color, just

f88e29df-f871-48af-b645-653c3f284a97-1
00:56:23.301 --> 00:56:27.178
like the man was in color, as
did a tree that is behind the

f88e29df-f871-48af-b645-653c3f284a97-2
00:56:27.178 --> 00:56:28.600
house on his property.

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-0
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:34.621
So we can see him out front. He
has mowed the grass, he has his

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-1
00:56:34.621 --> 00:56:39.253
lawn mower there. He has his
little doggie there. The the

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-2
00:56:39.253 --> 00:56:44.046
fence is now colored. He has a
bag that he has pulled weeds

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-3
00:56:44.046 --> 00:56:49.077
from. He has a garden hose where
he's watered the grass and he

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-4
00:56:49.077 --> 00:56:54.189
has taken the shutters that were
falling off the windows and he

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-5
00:56:54.189 --> 00:56:58.741
is on a ladder putting the
shutters back up on the House

84c86996-bffc-4850-9f03-d0c0288e223d-6
00:56:58.741 --> 00:56:59.940
and we can see.

9edb6f8e-71b4-4b80-8e3f-f1a90a313827-0
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.502
Inside the house, some colors we
can see the tree is multi

9edb6f8e-71b4-4b80-8e3f-f1a90a313827-1
00:57:04.502 --> 00:57:08.841
colored. It's got red, orange,
green, white. The roof is

9edb6f8e-71b4-4b80-8e3f-f1a90a313827-2
00:57:08.841 --> 00:57:13.638
turning like a starting to turn
from like a grayish brown to a

9edb6f8e-71b4-4b80-8e3f-f1a90a313827-3
00:57:13.638 --> 00:57:18.359
purple color. And the shutters
are blue. They match the color

9edb6f8e-71b4-4b80-8e3f-f1a90a313827-4
00:57:18.359 --> 00:57:23.232
of the man's shirt. So he's kind
of bringing life to this house

9edb6f8e-71b4-4b80-8e3f-f1a90a313827-5
00:57:23.232 --> 00:57:25.439
and trying to fix it back up.

a92fbaf4-98f5-4449-bd22-9db4771f4396-0
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:30.583
And there's people all around
him on the street kind of going

a92fbaf4-98f5-4449-bd22-9db4771f4396-1
00:57:30.583 --> 00:57:33.100
on with their day, but they're
all.

3d4cbf5d-1324-4ac1-a4e8-67bdc851826b-0
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:39.671
Still kind of just there. Their
facial expressions are kind of

3d4cbf5d-1324-4ac1-a4e8-67bdc851826b-1
00:57:39.671 --> 00:57:41.250
sad or gloomy or.

0891203f-3ea6-40ba-b65f-bcfb0b99b0ea-0
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:46.209
Maybe a little zombie lake and
everything else is black and

0891203f-3ea6-40ba-b65f-bcfb0b99b0ea-1
00:57:46.209 --> 00:57:49.652
white. They're still living in
kind of like a a dead black and

0891203f-3ea6-40ba-b65f-bcfb0b99b0ea-2
00:57:49.652 --> 00:57:49.980
white.

556e5631-0440-4eb1-bdad-a08901ab446e-0
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:54.390
Life and then we see another
shot.

2a2506cb-b394-4e0f-998c-6da63e90326e-0
00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.872
So it's the same the other image
that we just saw prior to

2a2506cb-b394-4e0f-998c-6da63e90326e-1
00:58:00.872 --> 00:58:04.602
people, again, kind of out and
about, but still all

2a2506cb-b394-4e0f-998c-6da63e90326e-2
00:58:04.602 --> 00:58:08.834
everything's black and white.
They're just kind of sad and

2a2506cb-b394-4e0f-998c-6da63e90326e-3
00:58:08.834 --> 00:58:09.910
kind of gloomy.

cf784d7d-1e6a-4d87-84e1-25b9de2e61f3-0
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:31.120
Now we see a picture of the man
in his front yard and not only

cf784d7d-1e6a-4d87-84e1-25b9de2e61f3-1
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.970
is the house.

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-0
00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:39.779
Definitely in better shape. You
know he's mowed the grass and

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-1
00:58:39.779 --> 00:58:45.084
he's put the shutters back up.
He has planted flowers in little

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-2
00:58:45.084 --> 00:58:50.223
window boxes and for the front
side of the windows he has put

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-3
00:58:50.223 --> 00:58:55.445
flowers along the fence line.
The roof of the the house is now

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-4
00:58:55.445 --> 00:59:00.419
a pretty royal purple and the
chimney even is colorful. The

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-5
00:59:00.419 --> 00:59:05.143
tree that was kind of multi
colored has even become more

870f53b1-6f31-4d4d-a8fb-a15382065e2d-6
00:59:05.143 --> 00:59:05.890
colorful.

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-0
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:10.293
Just more red and orange and
yellow. He's even planted some

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-1
00:59:10.293 --> 00:59:14.699
flower boxes on the top windows
of the house, and we can see

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-2
00:59:14.699 --> 00:59:19.033
inside of the house that there's
furniture and there's life

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-3
00:59:19.033 --> 00:59:23.294
there. Again. There's a very
nice upholstered chair in the

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-4
00:59:23.294 --> 00:59:27.844
living room and the other room.
It appears to be like a dining

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-5
00:59:27.844 --> 00:59:32.250
table and chair in his dining
room. Slash kitchen area. He's

9d4d3601-1a76-4c84-857e-09b3a10f2b56-6
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:36.440
even put up. Maybe it was there
before, but there's even.

af67bac1-d88f-4174-aa7a-ef0a7f3938e9-0
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:41.594
A mailbox along the edge of his
property. And he is as he's

af67bac1-d88f-4174-aa7a-ef0a7f3938e9-1
00:59:41.594 --> 00:59:46.569
putting these flowers on his
fence, he's waving to somebody

af67bac1-d88f-4174-aa7a-ef0a7f3938e9-2
00:59:46.569 --> 00:59:47.730
in the street.

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-0
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.544
Then we see the same other
picture before with all the

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-1
00:59:53.544 --> 00:59:57.335
people, kind of just going
through the motions of life.

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-2
00:59:57.335 --> 01:00:01.601
Everything is still black and
white, but there's a little girl

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-3
01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:06.003
holding one of the flowers that
she was given to by the man, and

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-4
01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:10.065
when he gave her that flower,
she now appears in color. You

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-5
01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:14.467
can tell she has red hair and a
Coney tail. She's got any yellow

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-6
01:00:14.467 --> 01:00:18.529
shirt, a blue skirt, and she's
holding a little pink flower

104f1dad-95c4-4387-bdce-1a4c8eed720f-7
01:00:18.529 --> 01:00:19.409
that the man.

3e8836a6-6f55-4d65-81a1-042615f72383-0
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.040
Pads.

22edb3fa-b53a-4bd1-8773-2b0a285d1ef3-0
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.140
Wow. Next thing you know.

814563ef-271a-4916-b5b4-1d4dfa91c317-0
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:38.800
The man has really inspired um.

f1be6262-4754-4b8e-901a-f279768dfc86-0
01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.386
Some of the people in that were
around you know in the in the

f1be6262-4754-4b8e-901a-f279768dfc86-1
01:00:44.386 --> 01:00:49.056
street and some of his neighbors
and they have now turned to

f1be6262-4754-4b8e-901a-f279768dfc86-2
01:00:49.056 --> 01:00:51.660
color. You can tell that
there's.

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-0
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:57.969
A man that is standing outside
of the property from this older

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-1
01:00:57.969 --> 01:01:02.536
gentleman who is holding one of
the flowers that he gave him.

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-2
01:01:02.536 --> 01:01:07.176
There's another little girl who
is leaning down petting a dog,

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-3
01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:11.595
and she has a flower in her
hair. There is the little girl.

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-4
01:01:11.595 --> 01:01:16.235
The little redhead is holding a
basket of some sort and she is

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-5
01:01:16.235 --> 01:01:20.948
hugging an older man with a dog.
You can see some of the people

e08c9963-d096-4b40-8a8f-fe72c1086fef-6
01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:22.790
have now there's a clown.

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-0
01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.871
Uh, some of the people have now
turned to color that have

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-1
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:30.628
engaged or interacted with this
man, and even the buildings

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-2
01:01:30.628 --> 01:01:34.448
around him are starting to turn
to color. There's a building

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-3
01:01:34.448 --> 01:01:37.641
across the way that has a
Coca-Cola written on the

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-4
01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:41.523
outside. Perhaps it's a a bar on
the bottom and apartments up

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-5
01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:45.468
top, but you can see the people
inside. The apartments are now

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-6
01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:49.225
colored. The the shutters are
now red. There's a man on the

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-7
01:01:49.225 --> 01:01:52.919
third floor of that building
that has an old another older

774990db-41c5-45bf-bc8f-c38e727654a2-8
01:01:52.919 --> 01:01:53.170
man.

e0c1b624-5366-4175-a107-19719856f7fe-0
01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.725
She's got a window box full of
flowers and two of the other

e0c1b624-5366-4175-a107-19719856f7fe-1
01:01:56.725 --> 01:02:00.248
buildings. You can see some of
the apartments and the people

e0c1b624-5366-4175-a107-19719856f7fe-2
01:02:00.248 --> 01:02:03.771
have now turned to color and
their shutters are colored. You

e0c1b624-5366-4175-a107-19719856f7fe-3
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:06.890
can see inside of their
apartment. So there's there's

e0c1b624-5366-4175-a107-19719856f7fe-4
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.719
some life coming to the people
and in this town.

5372f95a-8ca9-438c-8bb7-8acaaac5a124-0
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:15.409
Let me see another picture of
the other side of the street we

5372f95a-8ca9-438c-8bb7-8acaaac5a124-1
01:02:15.409 --> 01:02:15.950
can see.

8bd49af7-8943-47d6-b462-714922ed4b09-0
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:21.162
Some movers, movers and shakers,
which is a moving company, so

8bd49af7-8943-47d6-b462-714922ed4b09-1
01:02:21.162 --> 01:02:25.182
there's a moving van. This also
is still partially black and

8bd49af7-8943-47d6-b462-714922ed4b09-2
01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:29.203
white. But again, there have
been people who have received a

8bd49af7-8943-47d6-b462-714922ed4b09-3
01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:33.355
flower from this man, because
everybody who's in color appears

8bd49af7-8943-47d6-b462-714922ed4b09-4
01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:37.573
to have a flower. So there's an
older lady who is now turned to

8bd49af7-8943-47d6-b462-714922ed4b09-5
01:02:37.573 --> 01:02:40.209
color. She's got a flower in her
hands.

dee4a490-5e49-4b9e-8984-050e64582027-0
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.050
Even one of the movers is now in
color because he's got a flower.

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-0
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:51.189
There's a man who is sitting on
the 2nd floor of one of the

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-1
01:02:51.189 --> 01:02:55.824
buildings, appears like maybe in
his bathtub, and he's got a

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-2
01:02:55.824 --> 01:03:00.383
flower. So basically everybody
who gets a flower from this,

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-3
01:03:00.383 --> 01:03:04.942
from this older man at the
little house, turns to color and

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-4
01:03:04.942 --> 01:03:09.653
kind of comes to life and and
becomes happy. You can see that

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-5
01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:14.060
they're facial expressions.
They're much happier. They're

07dd5ddb-d742-4a5b-9693-f302d0e8fe74-6
01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:17.480
smiling. They're grateful,
they're laughing.

d9d5ba91-f9ea-432a-aec1-8c1feaea84af-0
01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.499
And in the areas that they live,
when they turn to color, their

d9d5ba91-f9ea-432a-aec1-8c1feaea84af-1
01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:27.130
homes or their little apartments
all turned to color as well.

854e5832-f5ed-43a3-9202-c370ad3f4c45-0
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.600
Now we can see um.

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-0
01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:43.514
Let me just look at it really
carefully now. We can see almost

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-1
01:03:43.514 --> 01:03:48.214
every person that is out in the
streets has a flower and has

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-2
01:03:48.214 --> 01:03:53.069
turned to color. And you can see
that people are engaging with

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-3
01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:57.692
one another. There's kids with,
you know, one kids offering

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-4
01:03:57.692 --> 01:04:02.624
another kid a ball who's they've
got a dog with them. There's a

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-5
01:04:02.624 --> 01:04:07.401
man in a wheelchair that a woman
is pushing and he's stopping

77cd3e1b-acb4-4972-beaf-97214c60750b-6
01:04:07.401 --> 01:04:07.710
and.

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-0
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.675
It's getting a flower from, uh,
a little girl on the street just

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-1
01:04:12.675 --> 01:04:17.100
outside of the house. The older
man. There's a woman there

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-2
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.825
holding a baby, and the man is
tossing a very small little boy

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-3
01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:26.175
up. He's actually got his grill
on and he's cooking. He's

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-4
01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:30.900
actually grilling out. There is
a milk truck. There's somebody

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-5
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.400
playing the guitar outside of
the little bar, but the whole

a00f6ba1-85b6-441d-bd6a-a7a9fa3ec8d4-6
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.800
little area has become nice and.

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-0
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:41.953
Colorful and alive again and
people are happy and engaging

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-1
01:04:41.953 --> 01:04:45.968
and interacting with one
another. And then we look to the

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-2
01:04:45.968 --> 01:04:50.052
other side of the street as
well. And that has also turned

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-3
01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:54.136
pretty much to all color. The
clown is got his little cart

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-4
01:04:54.136 --> 01:04:57.736
with his tricks and all his
little goodies and he's

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-5
01:04:57.736 --> 01:05:01.889
entertaining a little girl.
There is a kid in the fountain.

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-6
01:05:01.889 --> 01:05:06.319
The fountain now has water and
it's spraying out. There's a kid

b4791cd1-8032-41fb-b805-01bc5b6c8f6f-7
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.049
actually in the fountain.

20b4a152-fc9d-44e9-8045-d11eec94bc0f-0
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.960
Smiling and laughing and playing
in the water there is um.

3bd256b2-69a0-4c7a-b9e0-7c645a78cab1-0
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:18.440
There's a man sitting on his on
his step.

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-0
01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.830
Who has lost part of his, his
lower leg on one of his legs,

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-1
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:28.056
and he's sitting on the step
with his crutch and he's telling

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-2
01:05:28.056 --> 01:05:32.419
a story to some of the kids and
another older man. There's also

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-3
01:05:32.419 --> 01:05:36.577
a man out on the street with
paintings, and he's got them on

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-4
01:05:36.577 --> 01:05:40.531
an easel and he's waving to
people. The postman is coming

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-5
01:05:40.531 --> 01:05:44.553
around delivering letters.
People are in their apartments.

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-6
01:05:44.553 --> 01:05:48.234
There's a man in their his
apartment, he's painting a

1dfcdfe7-a6af-4a0f-a70e-756152134253-7
01:05:48.234 --> 01:05:48.780
picture.

51a465a1-92db-4555-8315-b97e4fd3f1e8-0
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.416
Just again, vibrancy and life.
And now this whole little town

51a465a1-92db-4555-8315-b97e4fd3f1e8-1
01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:56.490
has come to life, and it's
colorful and alive again.

73a14aed-d9f9-4864-9c4c-976ef0606291-0
01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:57.850
Yeah.

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-0
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.039
Now we can see that the sun is
setting, so the sky is starting

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-1
01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:13.645
to get a little bit darker. Go
from blue to kind of a pinkish

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-2
01:06:13.645 --> 01:06:18.027
color. There's not as much
light, but people are yet still

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-3
01:06:18.027 --> 01:06:22.707
out. There's a man with two kids
on the roof with a telescope,

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-4
01:06:22.707 --> 01:06:27.387
and he's looking up at the sky
to show the children. There's a

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-5
01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:31.844
man in the woman just sitting
out on the top of their roof,

bfca1cf8-31d7-43f8-87d4-f4b340743dfc-6
01:06:31.844 --> 01:06:32.810
just kind of.

f0be412b-5949-4d47-896d-bc2b45c1f11c-0
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:38.460
Um, holding each other and
looking out over the town? Um.

bd433710-8133-4c2f-b5ae-165a791959d8-0
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:46.540
A woman with her feet inside of
the fountain um.

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-0
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.522
And then people just still kind
of out and about on the streets,

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-1
01:06:51.522 --> 01:06:55.748
even though it's night time. And
the other picture we can see the

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-2
01:06:55.748 --> 01:06:59.525
man who is in the wheelchair and
he is running and kind of

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-3
01:06:59.525 --> 01:07:02.983
playing ball with some of the
kids. He's, he's in his

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-4
01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:06.761
wheelchair, but he's Wheeling
himself and he must have had

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-5
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:10.411
surgery or broken his leg
because he's got it in a cast,

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-6
01:07:10.411 --> 01:07:14.252
but he's Wheeling himself with
the kids and they're kind of

5c55fd07-b892-4b97-9ab6-abd11c12f44c-7
01:07:14.252 --> 01:07:16.430
running and chasing after a
ball.

b987b717-97e5-4418-8464-e4f8d8e07269-0
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:22.128
And then there's just, you know,
there's a man sitting out with

b987b717-97e5-4418-8464-e4f8d8e07269-1
01:07:22.128 --> 01:07:26.418
his dog on, on one of the steps
of the fire escape, there's a

b987b717-97e5-4418-8464-e4f8d8e07269-2
01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:27.110
woman who.

048fa9d2-b7be-409a-bdb1-26196e7c6b27-0
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:32.897
Is holding some kind of maybe
some kind of food who's coming

048fa9d2-b7be-409a-bdb1-26196e7c6b27-1
01:07:32.897 --> 01:07:37.259
out of the house. But every
every little apartment has

048fa9d2-b7be-409a-bdb1-26196e7c6b27-2
01:07:37.259 --> 01:07:41.700
something going on, and it's
colorful and it's vibrant.

2d4117c7-ad5b-4712-82bd-f2695219d667-0
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.131
There are people on this side
dancing and playing guitar.

2d4117c7-ad5b-4712-82bd-f2695219d667-1
01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:51.613
There's an older couple kind of
just walking together, happy,

2d4117c7-ad5b-4712-82bd-f2695219d667-2
01:07:51.613 --> 01:07:56.238
and they've the man has flowers,
a mother with her baby and her

2d4117c7-ad5b-4712-82bd-f2695219d667-3
01:07:56.238 --> 01:08:00.936
little daughter walking down the
street. But they're playing and

2d4117c7-ad5b-4712-82bd-f2695219d667-4
01:08:00.936 --> 01:08:05.490
they're they're enjoying life
and they're enjoying each other.

5d7fa012-a7dd-4574-a488-570cecdcd1d3-0
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.937
Now we can tell that it's
getting even later in the

5d7fa012-a7dd-4574-a488-570cecdcd1d3-1
01:08:18.937 --> 01:08:24.354
evening. Everything is still in
color. There are not as many

5d7fa012-a7dd-4574-a488-570cecdcd1d3-2
01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:29.949
people out on the streets, but
there are still a few people in

5d7fa012-a7dd-4574-a488-570cecdcd1d3-3
01:08:29.949 --> 01:08:33.590
there with their windows open.
Umm, and.

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-0
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:39.594
There is a man out on the
street, but we do see the older

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-1
01:08:39.594 --> 01:08:44.277
gentleman. He has taken his dog
and his belongings and his

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-2
01:08:44.277 --> 01:08:49.040
umbrella and he is leaving. He
is walking. Oh, sorry. He is

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-3
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.406
walking away from his little
house and down the little

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-4
01:08:53.406 --> 01:08:58.407
cobblestone Rd back towards the
way that he came in. Umm, he's

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-5
01:08:58.407 --> 01:09:03.249
walking by a little shop that
has that's a soda fountain and

2b6f054a-023e-4990-a2ff-872e57a8ffa2-6
01:09:03.249 --> 01:09:05.710
ice cream shop, but you do see.

a1e4bd5b-a04c-4340-b47f-81fb2f3f2384-0
01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:10.386
There are a couple of windows
that when you look inside have

a1e4bd5b-a04c-4340-b47f-81fb2f3f2384-1
01:09:10.386 --> 01:09:13.250
been turned to black and white
again.

3847fe46-458c-4d27-901e-35b129ad8c88-0
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:18.640
In the next picture we see
outside of the cafe.

a01e7164-4e0b-4b31-bffd-884f723a8d83-0
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:25.047
Some people out on the street
hanging out. There's a man on

a01e7164-4e0b-4b31-bffd-884f723a8d83-1
01:09:25.047 --> 01:09:28.772
the motorcycle. Above the cafe
is a couple. They're inside

a01e7164-4e0b-4b31-bffd-884f723a8d83-2
01:09:28.772 --> 01:09:32.939
their apartment dancing. Another
woman is just kind of gazing out

a01e7164-4e0b-4b31-bffd-884f723a8d83-3
01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:35.780
her window, smiling and watching
everything.

37c93f84-c53e-431f-9ff9-348e0ebe01b0-0
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:37.240
Um.

f17e15a2-f10f-42d8-9307-274458a2d382-0
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.753
And people are just still kind
of enjoying each other in some

f17e15a2-f10f-42d8-9307-274458a2d382-1
01:09:41.753 --> 01:09:45.130
of these, some of these little
apartments and balconies.

8406abd8-44ae-434a-9ce6-924571eb3a0b-0
01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:55.820
Huh. So now we have a scene.

3edd49b3-ebef-42dc-b36d-193d9f3bb267-0
01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.305
That is, it looks like maybe a
different part of the town or a

3edd49b3-ebef-42dc-b36d-193d9f3bb267-1
01:10:01.305 --> 01:10:02.240
different town.

433135ac-8047-4cb7-8861-1cbb9ebf563c-0
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:08.346
And we see it's all black and
white again, except for the sky.

433135ac-8047-4cb7-8861-1cbb9ebf563c-1
01:10:08.346 --> 01:10:13.323
The sky is either a dark purple
or kind of like a lighter

433135ac-8047-4cb7-8861-1cbb9ebf563c-2
01:10:13.323 --> 01:10:18.644
colored purple with some clouds.
But it's very similar to the

433135ac-8047-4cb7-8861-1cbb9ebf563c-3
01:10:18.644 --> 01:10:23.793
beginning of this, of the story
when the people are kind of

433135ac-8047-4cb7-8861-1cbb9ebf563c-4
01:10:23.793 --> 01:10:29.199
inside kind of gloomy looks on
their faces. Everything's black

433135ac-8047-4cb7-8861-1cbb9ebf563c-5
01:10:29.199 --> 01:10:32.890
and white, and they're just kind
of there.

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-0
01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.048
Uh, existing. But in the next
page we see, we see another

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-1
01:10:37.048 --> 01:10:41.397
House, black and White House,
but we see the man and it has a

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-2
01:10:41.397 --> 01:10:45.255
for sale sign. And we see the
man stop in front. He is

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-3
01:10:45.255 --> 01:10:49.674
colorful again. We see the man
stop in front of the house with

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-4
01:10:49.674 --> 01:10:53.813
his belongings, his umbrella,
and his little dog. And they

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-5
01:10:53.813 --> 01:10:58.092
stop in front of this House and
we can see the neighbors are

636c8446-5009-4e89-aa7e-d836a75eaaf8-6
01:10:58.092 --> 01:11:01.950
appearing out their windows
wondering who this man is.

2b258b80-0aac-48de-9d46-a9e1dd52cc4c-0
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:19.733
And the man stops. And one of
the neighbors was a little girl.

2b258b80-0aac-48de-9d46-a9e1dd52cc4c-1
01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:25.057
And she comes down and she, the
man gives her a flower and she

2b258b80-0aac-48de-9d46-a9e1dd52cc4c-2
01:11:25.057 --> 01:11:30.465
turns to color. She has a little
mouse on her shoulder. And she

2b258b80-0aac-48de-9d46-a9e1dd52cc4c-3
01:11:30.465 --> 01:11:35.620
and the mouse turned to color,
and she's got these big wide.

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-0
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:39.770
Open eyes, big Big Blue eyes
that are open and her mouth is

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-1
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:44.044
open and she's smiling and she's
got this Pretty Little purple

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-2
01:11:44.044 --> 01:11:48.387
flower that she's holding. And
then the downstairs neighbor was

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-3
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:52.593
also given a flower by the man.
He has a red flower and he is

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-4
01:11:52.593 --> 01:11:56.664
now turned to color and he is
looking outside watching this

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-5
01:11:56.664 --> 01:12:01.074
little girl smile at her flower
as the man proceeds to walk past

eedaf9d4-01b6-4516-9eee-552685cd57e2-6
01:12:01.074 --> 01:12:04.670
them with his belongings and his
dog. #END_flowerman

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:14.040
OK. So that was all that we have
today. Thank you. OK, sure.
