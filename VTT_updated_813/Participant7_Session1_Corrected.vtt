00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.705
In this norming study, we'll
have two types of stimuli. The

402ce763-7551-40bb-bf6a-02b913a28308-1
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:14.945
first type you'll see in a
moment, um, a complex scenes.

402ce763-7551-40bb-bf6a-02b913a28308-2
00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:20.184
OK, imagine that you're
describing this scene to someone

402ce763-7551-40bb-bf6a-02b913a28308-3
00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:25.975
who cannot see the picture. Tell
me what is happening and what

402ce763-7551-40bb-bf6a-02b913a28308-4
00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:30.480
you see in as many details as
possible, usually.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.695
Or please try to take between
three and five minutes to this

e19880c3-2782-45dc-a41e-ab936f01bd5a-1
00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:36.510
screen, OK?

a1efaa49-c88f-4cfb-a2b8-826ef81fd9b8-0
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.400
Yeah, that is a complex scene
that is very complex.

45542af0-d7b4-455d-8da1-7f225a0bd2c3-0
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.500
Alright, so do you want me to
begin now? Yes, OK.

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-0
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.747
#START_unfriendly_giants So
overall we have a very busy

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-1
00:00:58.747 --> 00:01:03.215
scene. It's labeled the
unfriendly giants and so in the

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-2
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:08.401
upper left hand corner there is
kind of what I would describe as

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-3
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.029
like a scroll type of figure
with a little green like wax

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-4
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:18.055
seal with blue and red ribbons
that stick out of it. {And this

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-5
00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:22.922
scroll has a statement that says
then Waldo and the wizard I

acfb12f2-5304-46da-b97e-f47d55fe43d1-6
00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:23.800
can't read.

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-0
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.337
White beard came to the land of
the unfriendly giants where many

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-1
00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:32.038
waldos had been before, and
Waldo saw that the Giants were

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-2
00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:35.865
were horridly harassing the
little people. When he found the

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-3
00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:39.566
10th scroll, it was time to
continue with his journey.} So

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-4
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:43.581
that is in the top left corner
of this page. And then the scene

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-5
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:47.407
looks like it has a bunch of
different giants in it and they

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-6
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:51.046
are all wearing different
outfits and they're in sort of.

167cf59d-1173-4dee-b027-70d2936a258c-7
00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:52.740
I would describe as like a.

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-0
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.181
Prairie sort of setting with
some trees. So at the top of the

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-1
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:02.580
page there is in the top left
there's a windmill behind that

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-2
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.268
scroll that I was talking about,
and to the left there's a giant

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-3
00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:11.379
with a blue shirt. As you
continue right across the page

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-4
00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.634
there are two giants who are
playing with something that I

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-5
00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:20.106
can't quite see what it is, but
one of them is wearing a blue

82833e03-3ca7-4521-a58a-bd13fd7c9a99-6
00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:23.640
and yellow shirt with a red tie
around his neck.

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-0
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.340
And some blue and yellow striped
pants, and the other is wearing

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-1
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.320
a green shirt with a blue and
red striped undershirt to

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-2
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.513
continue to the right. There's
an even larger giant who is

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-3
00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:41.205
hairy and he's wearing kind of a
red bro tank. And as long as you

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-4
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:45.256
continue to the right, there's a
castle made out of like

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-5
00:02:45.256 --> 00:02:49.378
cobblestones, like what you
would see in like Lord of the

40285a0a-596d-4871-9e3e-a86dceba9bc8-6
00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:54.070
Rings or something like that. On
top of the castle there are two.

f3981893-707f-485c-8861-97bd2330a049-0
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.487
What I would call kind of
peasant homes. And so one of the

f3981893-707f-485c-8861-97bd2330a049-1
00:02:58.487 --> 00:02:59.140
homes is.

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-0
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.044
um on the left, and it's well
structured, it has a yellow

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-1
00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:08.335
straw roof. And then the other
home on the right is the same,

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-2
00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:12.626
but someone is taking that roof
off. And then as you continue

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-3
00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:16.710
right on the page, there is
another large windmill. And it

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-4
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.278
looks like there's a large giant
who is turning the windmill with

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-5
00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:25.292
his arm. And so he's wearing
kind of a burly brown outfit

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-6
00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:29.584
with the same yellow and red
striped pants and then if you go

368614c3-7faa-484d-a3a9-cc6be801eb80-7
00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.830
down a little bit.

175171bb-3bdd-4db9-9fe3-53d9251791ba-0
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.984
On the page on that far right
side, there's a man and a woman

175171bb-3bdd-4db9-9fe3-53d9251791ba-1
00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:41.233
giants and looks like. I'm not
sure what kind of device they're

175171bb-3bdd-4db9-9fe3-53d9251791ba-2
00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.120
with. Maybe a catapult?

6cadef74-32d6-457f-904b-d72f395c61ac-0
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.612
And there's like a small village
to their left. You keep kind of

6cadef74-32d6-457f-904b-d72f395c61ac-1
00:03:48.612 --> 00:03:52.392
going around the page. There's a
little hill that a couple giants

6cadef74-32d6-457f-904b-d72f395c61ac-2
00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:55.713
are going up. One is a man
wearing a large red shirt with

6cadef74-32d6-457f-904b-d72f395c61ac-3
00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:56.630
big brown boots.

53e6ca82-d888-4f0a-9417-3a10b0b12e51-0
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.020
Umm.

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-0
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.718
And you keep going to the left
of the page, there's another

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-1
00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:07.062
giant. There's kind of like a
Cliff. And this giant is

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-2
00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:10.649
standing in some water and he's
got a red shirt and yellow

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-3
00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:14.298
pants. And then as you move
underneath that, {sorry, my cat

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-4
00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:17.703
is playing with the plastic bag
over here.} As you move

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-5
00:04:17.703 --> 00:04:21.473
underneath that scroll that we
talked about earlier, there is

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-6
00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:25.060
another one of those catapult
things on the left. And then

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-7
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.951
there's like a wooden cutout of
a female giant who is wearing a

ad0c001c-5d1f-4de2-9f0c-163014fbf8b5-8
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:29.559
red shirt.

1abbbd0b-da05-471a-9f57-e75c227daf2c-0
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.090
And a blue skirt. So she's got
blonde hair and there is a male

1abbbd0b-da05-471a-9f57-e75c227daf2c-1
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.309
giant in blue who is approaching
her. There's another small

1abbbd0b-da05-471a-9f57-e75c227daf2c-2
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:42.740
village behind the set of those
two giants with the same straw

1abbbd0b-da05-471a-9f57-e75c227daf2c-3
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.030
kind of roof. And then as you
continue right, the Giants are

1abbbd0b-da05-471a-9f57-e75c227daf2c-4
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.319
getting bigger the closer to the
bottom of the page you get.

7127b126-4906-421c-83cb-11722767aeb3-0
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.889
There's a couple of giants in
the middle. Looks like one of

7127b126-4906-421c-83cb-11722767aeb3-1
00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.131
them is setting a trap to catch
some humans. So he's got like a

7127b126-4906-421c-83cb-11722767aeb3-2
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.272
lasso and there's a bunch of
humans in it. It looks like he's

7127b126-4906-421c-83cb-11722767aeb3-3
00:05:02.272 --> 00:05:04.400
going to try to tighten it to
catch them.

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-0
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.444
There's a giant who's taking his
hat off to some humans, looks

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-1
00:05:09.444 --> 00:05:13.098
like he's being respectable to
them. And then on the far right

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-2
00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:16.752
there's another fake wooden cut
out of a female giant, and one

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-3
00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:20.116
of the male giants is giving her
flowers. And then as you

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-4
00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:23.654
continue to the bottom of the
page, this is kind of the last

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-5
00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:27.192
row of giants. They're in a
field of sorts and there's a lot

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-6
00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:30.440
of humans around, so they're
very small compared to the

08fae1bf-b9dc-43a9-b435-ce43009c2d38-7
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.890
giants and it looks like.

a3c9e8eb-8c86-48b1-b34f-6276e838c85e-0
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.752
On the bottom right page, the
Giants are slurping up some

a3c9e8eb-8c86-48b1-b34f-6276e838c85e-1
00:05:36.752 --> 00:05:40.672
water from a pond and then
spraying it out of giant straws

a3c9e8eb-8c86-48b1-b34f-6276e838c85e-2
00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:44.990
at the humans, and they're kind
of having fun with that. There's

a3c9e8eb-8c86-48b1-b34f-6276e838c85e-3
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.843
four of them there. As you
continue left, there's another

a3c9e8eb-8c86-48b1-b34f-6276e838c85e-4
00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:52.829
catapult that looks like the
humans are trying to launch at

a3c9e8eb-8c86-48b1-b34f-6276e838c85e-5
00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:53.560
the Giants.

dc87dcc5-bf86-4cc8-8944-20de43c230a4-0
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.990
Um.

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-0
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.494
And then in the kind of middle
left, there's a a chess board

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-1
00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:04.758
that's got humans on it in
yellow and blue. And there's a

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-2
00:06:04.758 --> 00:06:09.096
set of 123456 giants playing
chess with these humans. They

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-3
00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:13.433
all have different outfits on,
varying from orange, green,

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-4
00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:17.844
yellow, kind of a furry brown.
And then the far left of the

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-5
00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:22.550
paper, there's a whole bunch of
little humans. They almost look

6b9a1fd8-d371-4c28-9f4d-961a15478825-6
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.520
like ants, they're so small. And
there's another Hut.

790fe2f2-7ed6-4cb8-875c-5b4f019eb2d0-0
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.576
But this Hut has a chimney and
it's got the same straw yellow

790fe2f2-7ed6-4cb8-875c-5b4f019eb2d0-1
00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:33.855
roof and that is this page.
#END_unfriendly_giants All

790fe2f2-7ed6-4cb8-875c-5b4f019eb2d0-2
00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:34.750
right, perfect.

cc31b82b-c66d-4eec-b3ba-37c4f13f11bb-0
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.020
Moving on to the next item.

8565a084-8c5c-431e-907a-cbbd20dd9bca-0
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.590
Whenever you're ready, OK?

c75c5533-cd46-482e-a820-46e07c56ffe8-0
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.245
#START_being_a_pirate So this
page is labeled being a pirate.

c75c5533-cd46-482e-a820-46e07c56ffe8-1
00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:54.550
It's got a little small booklet
in the upper left hand corner.

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-0
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.200
{So it says 150 years ago on
there and then it says shiver me

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-1
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.197
Timbers and then it's got some
sort of text underneath that

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-2
00:07:04.197 --> 00:07:07.928
that is too small for me to
read.} But there's a little

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-3
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:12.126
picture of some pirates in the
upper right hand corner of that

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-4
00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:15.923
small picture book on the top
left of this page. And the

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-5
00:07:15.923 --> 00:07:20.054
overall image of this page is
kind of ocean and beach. And so

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-6
00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:24.318
the main image that you get is a
large ship, a bunch of smaller

4fb5efe5-8165-4dda-8b86-05ea6a3dabf2-7
00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:26.449
ships and then on the far right.

8a5d7667-f615-4c69-b902-5b3ac000fd89-0
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.212
Page there's a little beach, so
we'll start with the beach which

8a5d7667-f615-4c69-b902-5b3ac000fd89-1
00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:35.823
is on the far right side and the
top right hand corner. There's

8a5d7667-f615-4c69-b902-5b3ac000fd89-2
00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:40.001
some like small cliffs with
trees on them and as you wait

8a5d7667-f615-4c69-b902-5b3ac000fd89-3
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:44.323
make your way down the beach.
There are some people in blue

8a5d7667-f615-4c69-b902-5b3ac000fd89-4
00:07:44.323 --> 00:07:44.899
outfits.

12485a27-3385-48ac-b594-8fc7c20adc25-0
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.057
Taking what I would call like a
rowboat out to the sea and as

12485a27-3385-48ac-b594-8fc7c20adc25-1
00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:55.153
you continue down there's a
couple palm trees. I found

12485a27-3385-48ac-b594-8fc7c20adc25-2
00:07:55.153 --> 00:07:55.600
Waldo.

f3160ab4-cb79-49ad-85a4-b1100292137c-0
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.510
He's on the far right side of
the page, it looks like, and

f3160ab4-cb79-49ad-85a4-b1100292137c-1
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.119
then as you continue down, it's
just kind of more of the same.

f3160ab4-cb79-49ad-85a4-b1100292137c-2
00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:07.843
It gets a little busier. At the
bottom of the page. There's some

f3160ab4-cb79-49ad-85a4-b1100292137c-3
00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:10.250
people digging, there's a
treasure chest.

c1f47109-01d9-42f9-9d27-3d6d36930193-0
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.510
And a little bit of chaos at the
very bottom. And so on the very

c1f47109-01d9-42f9-9d27-3d6d36930193-1
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.305
bottom of the page there's
actually water instead of sand.

c1f47109-01d9-42f9-9d27-3d6d36930193-2
00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:24.100
And so there you have people
getting off of their rowboat.

e69ca223-b3e4-4d2e-8d0c-995e6eda7f55-0
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.978
But farther to the left, you
move. You can see more rowboats.

e69ca223-b3e4-4d2e-8d0c-995e6eda7f55-1
00:08:28.978 --> 00:08:32.384
Most of them are filled with
blue people, but some of them

e69ca223-b3e4-4d2e-8d0c-995e6eda7f55-2
00:08:32.384 --> 00:08:35.040
are filled with what looked like
the pirates.

ac7cbb74-4a56-4132-a705-5a0a05f99adc-0
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.228
And so it looks like there's
some sort of battle happening at

ac7cbb74-4a56-4132-a705-5a0a05f99adc-1
00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:43.747
the top of the scene. You can
see some little puffs of smoke.

ac7cbb74-4a56-4132-a705-5a0a05f99adc-2
00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:47.152
There's a larger ship there that
have three pirate flags, a

ac7cbb74-4a56-4132-a705-5a0a05f99adc-3
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.820
couple of crow's nests at the
top of the ship.

89c616ff-76ce-40d2-9aa2-75d077bb6481-0
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.344
And then in the kind of right
center of the page, there's a I

89c616ff-76ce-40d2-9aa2-75d077bb6481-1
00:08:56.344 --> 00:09:00.948
can't tell if it's an octopus or
a squid, but it's kind of a teal

89c616ff-76ce-40d2-9aa2-75d077bb6481-2
00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:05.412
color, and it's holding two of
the pirates. And there's a small

89c616ff-76ce-40d2-9aa2-75d077bb6481-3
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:09.806
rowboat of pirates who look like
they're kind of just watching

89c616ff-76ce-40d2-9aa2-75d077bb6481-4
00:09:09.806 --> 00:09:11.690
their friends die, I guess.

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-0
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.440
And as you continue down the
page, there's again more

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-1
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.501
rowboats, a lot of rowboats.
There's one rowboat at the kind

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-2
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.563
of middle bottom of the right
page that has snapped in half,

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-3
00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:25.825
and it's stinking. And there's a
man in the middle with his arms

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-4
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:29.037
in the air asking for help. And
as you get to the middle of the

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-5
00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:32.049
page, there's more robots. And
then on the left side of the

baf191f3-3ab1-4431-87d3-e9ba97d5cd9f-6
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:34.859
page, there's a very large
pirate ship. And so this is.

5afc0697-1b1f-41b4-87ba-60406287ee18-0
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.410
Well crowded with pirates and
what looked like kind of the men

5afc0697-1b1f-41b4-87ba-60406287ee18-1
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.110
in blue, who I'm guessing are.

c04820fa-b2e9-402f-89c6-fd5a9e3bc9a2-0
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.710
Seamen.

c7d859ec-c604-4740-8bde-3f304a927b9f-0
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.779
Kind of battling it out. There's
puffs of smoke coming from the

c7d859ec-c604-4740-8bde-3f304a927b9f-1
00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:51.589
cannons. There's a lot of action
going on. It looks like people

c7d859ec-c604-4740-8bde-3f304a927b9f-2
00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:55.101
and are fighting with each
other. And I do see now that at

c7d859ec-c604-4740-8bde-3f304a927b9f-3
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:58.494
the very top of this ship
there's a blue and white flag.

c7d859ec-c604-4740-8bde-3f304a927b9f-4
00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:02.066
So that makes me believe that
the pirates likely are taking

c7d859ec-c604-4740-8bde-3f304a927b9f-5
00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:02.899
over the ship.

b1591a1b-78cc-49d9-8b26-17f823a5d7e0-0
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.647
There's a Gold Mermaid figure
out the front of the ship and

b1591a1b-78cc-49d9-8b26-17f823a5d7e0-1
00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:12.555
then on the far left side of the
ship it looks like there's

b1591a1b-78cc-49d9-8b26-17f823a5d7e0-2
00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:16.267
another pirate ship that is
coming that has a lot of red

b1591a1b-78cc-49d9-8b26-17f823a5d7e0-3
00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:20.174
detailing on it. Either assist
in this ship or I'm not sure

b1591a1b-78cc-49d9-8b26-17f823a5d7e0-4
00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:24.342
what they're doing, but that's
kind of what I see on this page.

b1591a1b-78cc-49d9-8b26-17f823a5d7e0-5
00:10:24.342 --> 00:10:27.989
It's not a good idea. The last
one. #END_being_a_pirate

1868fe89-a95a-46a2-b081-91061f695594-0
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.520
Thank you.

d7c25555-6517-473b-9934-433c9a12eaad-0
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.410
OK.

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-0
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.082
Moving on, you will see a
different type of stimuli. They

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-1
00:10:38.082 --> 00:10:42.413
are wordless picture books. You
see a series of pictures that

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-2
00:10:42.413 --> 00:10:46.745
tell a story. Again, imagine
that you're telling a story that

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-3
00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:50.937
someone who cannot see them.
Describe what you see and what

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-4
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:54.989
is happening as you go through
the story. At most they're

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-5
00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:59.250
around 30 pages, so take around
10 to 15 minutes to tell the

49ad532f-5af5-48bf-9ed7-88ef3820e3e6-6
00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.670
story.

e5ad1945-1eeb-4512-bd09-1a9a06a17bbc-0
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.620
And you can take your time to
look at it if that is helpful.

e1e8d198-52f4-43c6-998d-94a21f252e8a-0
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.830
So what started it?

04c5326f-efc4-468e-9999-c327dd13d37e-0
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:16.600
Alright, so this story begins.
Let's see here.

24e24a53-f398-4980-a331-4f6c58f728ff-0
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:27.008
#START_arrival_6 So this story
is, I'm just going to preface

24e24a53-f398-4980-a331-4f6c58f728ff-1
00:11:27.008 --> 00:11:31.866
that this story is kind of set
in sepia tone. So it kind of

24e24a53-f398-4980-a331-4f6c58f728ff-2
00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:36.885
takes you back to, I don't know,
maybe like the 50s or 40s is

24e24a53-f398-4980-a331-4f6c58f728ff-3
00:11:36.885 --> 00:11:42.228
what it looks like to me. And it
looks like it is a story about a

24e24a53-f398-4980-a331-4f6c58f728ff-4
00:11:42.228 --> 00:11:47.248
man who is writing a letter and
he writes this letter with an

24e24a53-f398-4980-a331-4f6c58f728ff-5
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.219
ink and pen.

5cd3de41-e967-404c-9f3e-3af3f7151467-0
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.084
And after he writes his letter
that is filled with some secret

5cd3de41-e967-404c-9f3e-3af3f7151467-1
00:11:53.084 --> 00:11:57.241
messages that he doesn't want
anybody to know, he folds it up

5cd3de41-e967-404c-9f3e-3af3f7151467-2
00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:01.196
into the shape of an origami
bird. And he places this bird

5cd3de41-e967-404c-9f3e-3af3f7151467-3
00:12:01.196 --> 00:12:05.152
into a sealed envelope along
with some money. And he licks

5cd3de41-e967-404c-9f3e-3af3f7151467-4
00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:08.170
that envelope clothes, places a
stamp on it.

9f0d9e90-9d96-4558-8ae8-cedfa61ec126-0
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.827
And he walks it down the stairs
with the help of a small

9f0d9e90-9d96-4558-8ae8-cedfa61ec126-1
00:12:14.827 --> 00:12:20.296
creature. This creature of his
has a mouse like face, but its

9f0d9e90-9d96-4558-8ae8-cedfa61ec126-2
00:12:20.296 --> 00:12:24.530
tail is more similar to that of
an axolotl and.

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-0
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.879
He works his way down the
stairs. He comes across a woman

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-1
00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:32.543
who's carrying a basket, and as
you see this woman, he's talking

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-2
00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:36.151
to her, and nothing seems odd.
But the more he talks to her, he

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-3
00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:39.872
starts to get kind of a peculiar
feeling about this woman, and as

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-4
00:12:39.872 --> 00:12:43.198
she turns to walk away, he
notices that she has a tail. He

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-5
00:12:43.198 --> 00:12:46.693
doesn't think too much about
this and he continues on his way

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-6
00:12:46.693 --> 00:12:50.188
with his letter because it's
very important that he gets this

cb9f9d92-68b8-474f-b059-9150670e1465-7
00:12:50.188 --> 00:12:50.470
sent.

30179302-286e-45e0-84b1-d3e395488afb-0
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.494
So he takes this letter over to
this machine. He places it

30179302-286e-45e0-84b1-d3e395488afb-1
00:12:56.494 --> 00:13:02.222
inside the machine, and as he
placed it inside, he looks up to

30179302-286e-45e0-84b1-d3e395488afb-2
00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:07.496
the heavens and he sees as he
pushes the button, that the

30179302-286e-45e0-84b1-d3e395488afb-3
00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:12.678
balloon at the top of the
machine inflates, and away his

30179302-286e-45e0-84b1-d3e395488afb-4
00:13:12.678 --> 00:13:13.770
letter goes.

f7bd3ce3-8725-40f7-b52f-27b7e2a54286-0
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.240
So um.

2989ae00-7faf-4ba9-a1ad-4ef078d64d5e-0
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.745
We start to learn a little bit
more about the world that he's

2989ae00-7faf-4ba9-a1ad-4ef078d64d5e-1
00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:23.390
living in.

03cfe9a7-6f71-4080-9b1a-7316490a8647-0
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.900
This world is something that
kind of.

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-0
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.222
Everything is not what you take
it at face value and so a leaf

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-1
00:13:32.222 --> 00:13:36.804
can look like a leaf, but as it
begins to die you can see that

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-2
00:13:36.804 --> 00:13:41.314
it kind of turns more into what
I would describe as an insect

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-3
00:13:41.314 --> 00:13:45.751
like figure. And it's still a
leaf but it just has the image

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-4
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:50.333
of an insect. As the dandelion
dies it kind of grows into more

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-5
00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:54.406
of what I don't know like a
poppy. And so each of these

acdf1b0f-9393-494d-ac29-4e57dae99877-6
00:13:54.406 --> 00:13:57.680
objects in this world kind of
have a second.

592194af-1c90-4ab4-bd16-f87617b7f205-0
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.710
Life behind them is what I would
say.

2ee25e83-620d-4453-bf75-963243428091-0
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.360
Is this all the same story?

47773ef2-44b7-4e89-9cf9-b928f54b823e-0
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.560
Just trying to figure out where
I'm going with my story.

a9f17100-89cb-4549-a687-263317517d73-0
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.028
All right. So again, as we're
learning more about this world,

a9f17100-89cb-4549-a687-263317517d73-1
00:14:19.028 --> 00:14:24.089
this we kind of get a little
background on some underlying

a9f17100-89cb-4549-a687-263317517d73-2
00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:28.635
workings and you start to
realize that this world is

a9f17100-89cb-4549-a687-263317517d73-3
00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:30.180
almost similar to.

b1118001-b73b-490d-98e1-65ad72ea5d57-0
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.039
Like a like a Soviet Russia.
It's people are all kind of

b1118001-b73b-490d-98e1-65ad72ea5d57-1
00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:45.243
stacked on top of one another in
like housing buildings and it's

b1118001-b73b-490d-98e1-65ad72ea5d57-2
00:14:45.243 --> 00:14:48.870
it's stark, it's cold, it's a
lot of.

b2c8d2f6-bbdc-4f36-835b-965c0a3e3eb6-0
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.810
Like factory jobs, just everyone
getting by doing their work.

6caac808-00f2-402c-b21b-2ac3e99ef5dd-0
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.425
But there isn't much money to go
around because they're all

6caac808-00f2-402c-b21b-2ac3e99ef5dd-1
00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:03.033
sharing. And although these
societies seem good on the

6caac808-00f2-402c-b21b-2ac3e99ef5dd-2
00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:07.166
outside, oftentimes they aren't
working as well at the surface

6caac808-00f2-402c-b21b-2ac3e99ef5dd-3
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.200
level that's getting political.

d96af883-0bfe-45b6-bafe-55cbb1e1051f-0
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:10.990
Yeah.

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-0
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.891
So anyways, Umm, he's in this
world where, you know, things

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-1
00:15:16.891 --> 00:15:20.275
aren't as they seem at the
surface. There isn't much for

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-2
00:15:20.275 --> 00:15:23.836
the working class of people.
They're kind of stuck in this,

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-3
00:15:23.836 --> 00:15:26.923
you know, they're going
day-to-day at their factory

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-4
00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:30.425
jobs. They aren't given a huge
percentage of their income.

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-5
00:15:30.425 --> 00:15:33.749
They're stuck in these large
buildings where, you know,

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-6
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:37.133
families are stacked one on top
of each other. And we're

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-7
00:15:37.133 --> 00:15:40.219
starting to think that
potentially his letter could

4dbe80df-c1e9-43d7-bd74-92e9184d60bf-8
00:15:40.219 --> 00:15:42.059
have something to do with this.

37305764-e842-491e-80ef-a7b98ec2a683-0
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.140
{Next page.}

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-0
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.955
So we find this man again. He's
sitting inside his small

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-1
00:15:49.955 --> 00:15:54.553
apartment building which he has
made homie with a few things he

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-2
00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:59.152
has managed to find and buy with
his limited wages. And he does

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-3
00:15:59.152 --> 00:16:03.319
have a couple of kind of pets
and creatures that he keeps

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-4
00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:07.487
including that mouse like
creature with the axolotl tail.

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-5
00:16:07.487 --> 00:16:12.229
But we see him with a pot and in
that pot it looks like there are

cffbc415-7d66-48b4-899f-69a770b8c030-6
00:16:12.229 --> 00:16:13.810
some kind of hatching.

acfcbc22-363a-4dc8-bba7-57d26f623634-0
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.186
Bird like creatures and he says
they get fed and he's kind of

acfcbc22-363a-4dc8-bba7-57d26f623634-1
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:23.418
sitting there longingly looking
at a photo and we don't know who

acfcbc22-363a-4dc8-bba7-57d26f623634-2
00:16:23.418 --> 00:16:27.000
this photo is of yet, but we
will find out, I imagine.

2570ef1c-d36f-442a-a90e-9583fa00ea2b-0
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.100
Little foreshadowing.

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-0
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.830
So he's sitting there looking at
this beautiful photo of someone

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-1
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.506
that is important to him in his
room, where the walls are

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-2
00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:45.690
plastered with items and things.
And he's got his laundry hung up

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-3
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.177
and his little creature, the
mouse like one is kind of

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-4
00:16:49.177 --> 00:16:52.917
sitting on the bed beside him.
And then all of a sudden it

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-5
00:16:52.917 --> 00:16:57.037
scurries down the ladder. And so
the man is like, that's kind of

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-6
00:16:57.037 --> 00:17:00.967
weird. Not, you know, we're just
kind of chilling. So he goes

ae79312e-1255-49f4-a371-b51466002b51-7
00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:03.820
down the ladder and he finds
that the mouse.

f725c90f-20e8-4a5f-ae8b-a97a43b8408b-0
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.470
Found a letter and here he
thinks ooh, someone replied to

f725c90f-20e8-4a5f-ae8b-a97a43b8408b-1
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.260
my letter. This is excellent.

230e6e89-e51c-4637-b2e5-08cb84f9768c-0
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.615
So he opens it and we can see
that this letter has three

230e6e89-e51c-4637-b2e5-08cb84f9768c-1
00:17:14.615 --> 00:17:18.529
stamps on it where the letter he
sent had one and so we believe

230e6e89-e51c-4637-b2e5-08cb84f9768c-2
00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:22.320
it to be a different letter. He
opens it up and he finds that

230e6e89-e51c-4637-b2e5-08cb84f9768c-3
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.050
there is another letter inside
and it is folded the same way

230e6e89-e51c-4637-b2e5-08cb84f9768c-4
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.130
into the origami bird as his
was.

444da140-62d3-421c-b397-8aaf7d9e25ef-0
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.558
At first he thinks that he's
been tricked, you know? Is this

444da140-62d3-421c-b397-8aaf7d9e25ef-1
00:17:33.558 --> 00:17:37.124
the same letter I sent and they
just sent it back to me and I I

444da140-62d3-421c-b397-8aaf7d9e25ef-2
00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:40.746
won't get my answers. But as he
opens it and reads it, he starts

444da140-62d3-421c-b397-8aaf7d9e25ef-3
00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:44.034
to smile because he realizes
it's reply and so he looks up

444da140-62d3-421c-b397-8aaf7d9e25ef-4
00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:45.650
out of his window to the sky.

5ccb7a3e-5007-4dc1-9799-04238dfa9018-0
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.103
And he's thinking about, you
know, all the different things

5ccb7a3e-5007-4dc1-9799-04238dfa9018-1
00:17:54.103 --> 00:17:58.787
that he and this person he wrote
to have lived and talked about.

5ccb7a3e-5007-4dc1-9799-04238dfa9018-2
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:03.110
And so he he's thinking about
the different origami animals

5ccb7a3e-5007-4dc1-9799-04238dfa9018-3
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.649
that they've made together. He's
thinking about, you know, the

5ccb7a3e-5007-4dc1-9799-04238dfa9018-4
00:18:07.649 --> 00:18:12.261
little stove that was in their
apartment, how his hat hung next

5ccb7a3e-5007-4dc1-9799-04238dfa9018-5
00:18:12.261 --> 00:18:12.910
to their.

3b2bbe85-8b26-44db-846f-3e3c75e3e74b-0
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:19.933
Shawl. the the stews they made
together, the the drawings that

3b2bbe85-8b26-44db-846f-3e3c75e3e74b-1
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:25.091
their child drew for them. And
so he's thinking about his

3b2bbe85-8b26-44db-846f-3e3c75e3e74b-2
00:18:25.091 --> 00:18:26.069
family and.

853a703a-cf2e-4cec-a67e-2fb637a675fa-0
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.980
He starts to have this memory
about.

773382af-d665-48fc-bbb4-7674ab09969d-0
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.430
Giving a coin to his daughter.

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-0
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.258
But he continues, you know,
he's, he's talking to his

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-1
00:18:41.258 --> 00:18:44.961
family. He's or getting deeper
and deeper into this memory

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-2
00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:48.914
about giving his daughter this
coin. And we kind of started to

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-3
00:18:48.914 --> 00:18:52.366
have a flashback where he's
sitting at the dining room

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-4
00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:56.382
table, you can see his wife and
his younger child. She looks to

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-5
00:18:56.382 --> 00:18:59.645
be about four years old, and
their house is kind of

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-6
00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:03.598
fantastical, even though it's
still a smaller home. {Sorry, my

9cd31f49-3822-4af0-a662-c71e39106f07-7
00:19:03.598 --> 00:19:03.850
dog.

4394bb22-cdfb-4bca-9441-2f2d8f1f3546-0
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.250
Really wants to play with the
cat who is on the table.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.050
Ali.

bf37dbae-cb79-4e94-b226-ca0c84b47356-0
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.030
So.}

c5b71a9c-cc41-4122-97a3-d9b800c1be3b-0
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.432
So they're having this, he's
kind of having this flashback,

c5b71a9c-cc41-4122-97a3-d9b800c1be3b-1
00:19:19.432 --> 00:19:21.380
and he's thinking, you know?

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-0
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.701
I gave my daughter this coin. We
have our our pets. He's

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-1
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:30.127
reliving, you know, the good
times that he had you know put.

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-2
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:33.553
And then he he starts to think
what happened after this this

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-3
00:19:33.553 --> 00:19:36.866
excellent memory I had of
sitting around the table with my

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-4
00:19:36.866 --> 00:19:40.180
family. And it starts to turn
dark and he begins to have a

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-5
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.493
little bit of a darker flashback
of, you know, getting his

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-6
00:19:43.493 --> 00:19:47.032
daughter dressed to go outside.
She puts on her hat. She looks

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-7
00:19:47.032 --> 00:19:50.626
as though she's crying and then
suddenly she's running down the

7eebea02-041a-43ed-816c-e3061f4cc4ed-8
00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:53.210
stairs and it looks like it's
night time and.

e0176588-823a-4876-8ee7-48d2323f7fce-0
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.867
And all of a sudden there's a
bright light that she's holding.

e0176588-823a-4876-8ee7-48d2323f7fce-1
00:19:55.867 --> 00:19:56.440
#END_arrival_6

c48f4d95-759c-4ecb-8cc9-eddc25024050-0
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.930
OK. So that was part of that
story and we'll move on to the

c48f4d95-759c-4ecb-8cc9-eddc25024050-1
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.280
next item. It's also, I don't
know where that story is.

35824140-ecb2-49c9-be4d-dbeb610cb93b-0
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.697
That's good, you know, keep you
interested. The next item is

35824140-ecb2-49c9-be4d-dbeb610cb93b-1
00:20:16.697 --> 00:20:18.860
also a part of the story.

d5bf7940-f23e-4863-9e30-c7bb5d887478-0
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.470
A story, I guess.

6ffadd22-3221-4638-ad28-90f86df1cde7-0
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.990
Or just things. OK, this is such
cute illustrations.

9f307272-1cdc-4551-8340-78e6f5516add-0
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.401
#START_journey All right, so
this is a story about a young

9f307272-1cdc-4551-8340-78e6f5516add-1
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:34.730
boy.

e0f74693-e64e-4384-8e59-081ba740c14d-0
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:41.192
I think we'll see. But he has an
item for a girl that he wants to

e0f74693-e64e-4384-8e59-081ba740c14d-1
00:20:41.192 --> 00:20:46.116
give. And so they live in this
kind of quaint town. It almost

e0f74693-e64e-4384-8e59-081ba740c14d-2
00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:51.041
looks like a city. They look
like they're on the outskirts of

e0f74693-e64e-4384-8e59-081ba740c14d-3
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:55.965
a city and maybe approaching,
you know, where the city limits

e0f74693-e64e-4384-8e59-081ba740c14d-4
00:20:55.965 --> 00:21:01.049
end? Apartments, but very nice
and cute. And there's this young

e0f74693-e64e-4384-8e59-081ba740c14d-5
00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:05.100
girl sitting on the stair steps
and there's a red.

139225c5-916c-4cf2-8dae-b87015c35735-0
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.652
Scooter and she looks very sad
as she sits there. And so the

139225c5-916c-4cf2-8dae-b87015c35735-1
00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:13.823
young boy is kind of thinking,
you know, how can I cheer this

139225c5-916c-4cf2-8dae-b87015c35735-2
00:21:13.823 --> 00:21:16.110
young girl up in my
neighborhood?

80fd2dfb-71e6-4804-8865-fb79478a5a61-0
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.550
{Simon.}

279296ce-3865-450a-aac4-41e96cf0af74-0
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.112
So as we kind of set the scene
for this, we we noticed some

279296ce-3865-450a-aac4-41e96cf0af74-1
00:21:28.112 --> 00:21:31.517
other characters in the the
story. There's a man who lives

279296ce-3865-450a-aac4-41e96cf0af74-2
00:21:31.517 --> 00:21:34.460
in the upstairs apartment who
works on a computer.

4e32144a-af33-4924-8692-ef55a4fbd57a-0
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:41.731
He lives in, well, one would
call, you know, very library or

4e32144a-af33-4924-8692-ef55a4fbd57a-1
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:46.530
aesthetic, you know, like the
Dark Academia type feel.

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-0
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.918
In the next room over, there's a
girl on a couch who plays um

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-1
00:21:51.918 --> 00:21:55.430
what looks like some sort of
electronic device. In the

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-2
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.325
downstairs compartment that
there's an old Tiffany lamp with

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-3
00:21:59.325 --> 00:22:03.092
family photos on the wall and
cute wallpaper. And then the

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-4
00:22:03.092 --> 00:22:07.051
right of that there's a a woman
in the kitchen who looks like

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-5
00:22:07.051 --> 00:22:11.074
she's on the phone, but she's
also got her hand in the pot. So

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-6
00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:15.032
she appears very busy and we
start to put together that maybe

fe91b86c-0815-48d3-9e82-a762d34c6c54-7
00:22:15.032 --> 00:22:17.970
this young girl feels left out
of her family.

c820b8b0-a2b9-4e77-9d61-3a495d292183-0
00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.166
But the little boy still has an
idea of how he can help her to

c820b8b0-a2b9-4e77-9d61-3a495d292183-1
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:22.950
feel better.

f282a655-1dfa-4a4e-838f-fe8f9169686c-0
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.734
What's interesting about this
story is that the illustrator

f282a655-1dfa-4a4e-838f-fe8f9169686c-1
00:22:33.734 --> 00:22:38.545
really emphasizes things on each
page, and so you can see in each

f282a655-1dfa-4a4e-838f-fe8f9169686c-2
00:22:38.545 --> 00:22:42.846
page that there's something
that's kind of bold and in all

f282a655-1dfa-4a4e-838f-fe8f9169686c-3
00:22:42.846 --> 00:22:43.430
red ink.

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-0
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.942
So on the first page, it was the
scooter, and then something in

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-1
00:22:47.942 --> 00:22:51.271
this little boy's hand. And now
we have this little girl who's

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-2
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:54.601
in the kitchen with her mother.
And that red scooter is there,

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-3
00:22:54.601 --> 00:22:57.772
and her mother is still on the
phone and she's on her tippy

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-4
00:22:57.772 --> 00:23:00.943
toes trying to look at the
counter. We're not sure if she's

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-5
00:23:00.943 --> 00:23:04.325
trying to help or she just wants
you know to get attention. And

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-6
00:23:04.325 --> 00:23:07.760
then she's, well, we presume, up
in the library with her dad and

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-7
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.931
he's, you know, staring like a
zombie into his computer and

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-8
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:13.944
she's peering over the back of
her chair with a red kite

4e4af9e4-2756-4d5b-b078-99f653976148-9
00:23:13.944 --> 00:23:14.420
dangling.

735dc22a-fc59-4a83-90ab-4f0dcf4e2f1c-0
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.356
behind her, and then we see her
with what we can presume is her

735dc22a-fc59-4a83-90ab-4f0dcf4e2f1c-1
00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:21.763
older sister, who's laying on
the couch staring into her

735dc22a-fc59-4a83-90ab-4f0dcf4e2f1c-2
00:23:21.763 --> 00:23:22.840
electronic device.

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-0
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.138
And the little girl has a red
ball, but it seems that nobody

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-1
00:23:28.138 --> 00:23:32.181
is paying attention to her. And
we start to get the idea that

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-2
00:23:32.181 --> 00:23:36.159
this little girl feels very
lonely. So she she goes into her

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-3
00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:40.138
room. Her room is a nice quiet
space. She's got a map of the

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-4
00:23:40.138 --> 00:23:44.311
world on the wall. She's got a
dresser, a window, and there's a

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-5
00:23:44.311 --> 00:23:47.964
small cat sleeping on the far
right corner and a couple

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-6
00:23:47.964 --> 00:23:52.007
scattered pictures. But you can
tell that this little girl is

22d6dd40-dba4-4915-95d7-84d560d51d7a-7
00:23:52.007 --> 00:23:54.290
like up upset. She's got her
arms.

c7614481-0317-4e0b-a1a5-dcb2d76d24c7-0
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.480
Crossed and folded as she lays
in bed with her door open.

d225b2cb-aaae-4e73-8d1a-1f337063cec6-0
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.600
The cat then leaves the room and
the little girl kind of looks

d225b2cb-aaae-4e73-8d1a-1f337063cec6-1
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.532
over to where it was laying and
we see on the ground again this

d225b2cb-aaae-4e73-8d1a-1f337063cec6-2
00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:14.342
red object, which we believe to
have some sort of importance.

d225b2cb-aaae-4e73-8d1a-1f337063cec6-3
00:24:14.342 --> 00:24:17.660
And so the red object this time
is a writing utensil.

8ee146ee-431a-45ea-9f61-4270201efb84-0
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.768
So little girl kind of runs over
there and she picks it up and

8ee146ee-431a-45ea-9f61-4270201efb84-1
00:24:22.768 --> 00:24:23.890
she starts to draw.

634fa3c9-0614-4312-9a1e-061c191d92a8-0
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.759
But she's not drawing on the
paper. She begins to kind of

634fa3c9-0614-4312-9a1e-061c191d92a8-1
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:32.811
draw in the air. And this, we
find out, is no ordinary pencil.

634fa3c9-0614-4312-9a1e-061c191d92a8-2
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:36.927
And so she draws a doorway. And
through this doorway she's able

634fa3c9-0614-4312-9a1e-061c191d92a8-3
00:24:36.927 --> 00:24:40.592
to run, and it kind of glows a
red and green as she goes

634fa3c9-0614-4312-9a1e-061c191d92a8-4
00:24:40.592 --> 00:24:41.299
through it.

f631ac64-73ea-487d-945c-c5fdeda35939-0
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.992
Now we kind of see her from the
other side of that doorway.

f631ac64-73ea-487d-945c-c5fdeda35939-1
00:24:49.992 --> 00:24:53.995
She's she's poking out of it.
The door is red. It's kind of

f631ac64-73ea-487d-945c-c5fdeda35939-2
00:24:53.995 --> 00:24:56.529
like the entryway to what? A
cottage?

245c6d6a-bed5-4593-b060-bb5655be00ff-0
00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.107
That kind of door, you know,
it's arched and she's holding on

245c6d6a-bed5-4593-b060-bb5655be00ff-1
00:25:01.107 --> 00:25:04.666
to the doorknob as she steps
through, and it's coming out of

245c6d6a-bed5-4593-b060-bb5655be00ff-2
00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:08.049
the base of a large tree. And we
find her in kind of this

245c6d6a-bed5-4593-b060-bb5655be00ff-3
00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:08.750
fantastical.

e77e548f-63db-4160-87d6-bb6fa3852e2a-0
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.092
Forest with these beautiful they
look like paper lanterns made of

e77e548f-63db-4160-87d6-bb6fa3852e2a-1
00:25:16.092 --> 00:25:21.305
blue, intricate designs hanging
from the trees. And then there's

e77e548f-63db-4160-87d6-bb6fa3852e2a-2
00:25:21.305 --> 00:25:26.037
ropes of, you know, yellow
sparkling fairy lights dangling

e77e548f-63db-4160-87d6-bb6fa3852e2a-3
00:25:26.037 --> 00:25:30.768
around, and there's a small
river that's starting to curve

e77e548f-63db-4160-87d6-bb6fa3852e2a-4
00:25:30.768 --> 00:25:31.329
and so.

ecf420af-2148-4e00-b14f-299bd01b7b32-0
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.761
And this girl is taking it all
in. You just kind of get a

ecf420af-2148-4e00-b14f-299bd01b7b32-1
00:25:35.761 --> 00:25:38.950
breath that this is going to be
kind of a cool place to be.

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-0
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.575
So the little girl begins to
explore her world that she kind

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-1
00:25:47.575 --> 00:25:51.486
of realizes, you know, maybe
this this pen, I can do what I

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-2
00:25:51.486 --> 00:25:55.592
want with it. If I could draw a
doorway into this world, maybe

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-3
00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:59.568
there's other things I can do
with it, too. This is, this is

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-4
00:25:59.568 --> 00:26:03.543
my world. I have control here,
where I had no control in the

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-5
00:26:03.543 --> 00:26:07.584
world I was in before. And so
she starts to explore, and she,

a7e9db53-df73-47ec-abf3-cf0da9e721e8-6
00:26:07.584 --> 00:26:09.539
she finds herself on a a dock.

eb9976c7-227b-4aab-8dcc-a47221ab385c-0
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.932
Since she's standing on the
edge, peering over, looking into

eb9976c7-227b-4aab-8dcc-a47221ab385c-1
00:26:12.932 --> 00:26:15.720
a river, and you can see in her
hand she has that magic.

88f4e8df-bde2-4631-8ff9-21f5f9885951-0
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.675
Writing utensil and you can see
the reflection of it in the

88f4e8df-bde2-4631-8ff9-21f5f9885951-1
00:26:20.675 --> 00:26:24.290
water, and she begins to draw
herself a boat, just kind of

88f4e8df-bde2-4631-8ff9-21f5f9885951-2
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.027
your standard wooden rowboat.
But there aren't any oars. And

88f4e8df-bde2-4631-8ff9-21f5f9885951-3
00:26:28.027 --> 00:26:32.070
so she draws this boat, it comes
up red and she climbs in and she

88f4e8df-bde2-4631-8ff9-21f5f9885951-4
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.970
starts to float down the river.

41d9e042-f18c-4fdf-ac47-6f3a88704c95-0
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.560
So as she floats.

dacfaf23-af1c-4964-98c0-db8fe7fada9e-0
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.830
We see her approach this.

494a37c2-bc7f-4710-baa2-0c10c8b9c306-0
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.660
Magnificent castle.

362dfde0-0910-4872-b854-43f14ca4b1fe-0
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.090
It's huge. It's.

dcd1a613-bed6-4d35-ba6a-fd7fa804e224-0
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:54.188
It's a mix of design styles.
You've got, you know, a little

dcd1a613-bed6-4d35-ba6a-fd7fa804e224-1
00:26:54.188 --> 00:26:58.365
bit of Gothic elements, a little
bit of kind of Greek Orthodox

dcd1a613-bed6-4d35-ba6a-fd7fa804e224-2
00:26:58.365 --> 00:26:59.360
elements. It's.

b81e8067-1a9e-4c18-98f7-32fce0d1a7b1-0
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.800
They would call, you know, what
are those houses that they say

b81e8067-1a9e-4c18-98f7-32fce0d1a7b1-1
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.345
like middle-aged people designed
where it's like got a bunch of

b81e8067-1a9e-4c18-98f7-32fce0d1a7b1-2
00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:11.059
design elements but they don't
do well together.

b35c8173-38c1-4f0b-b293-53a9c5cd7629-0
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.973
One of those, but it it looks it
looks good here. There's a Moat

b35c8173-38c1-4f0b-b293-53a9c5cd7629-1
00:27:16.973 --> 00:27:21.328
around this castle and you can
see that the the top of the the

b35c8173-38c1-4f0b-b293-53a9c5cd7629-2
00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:25.130
kind of orthodox shape things,
they're they're golden.

346fc303-bd52-46b1-bc86-94e2baaab3a1-0
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:31.183
There's a there's a gate at the
entrance that she's approaching.

346fc303-bd52-46b1-bc86-94e2baaab3a1-1
00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:35.421
On the other side, there's a
large bridge and it's just huge.

346fc303-bd52-46b1-bc86-94e2baaab3a1-2
00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:39.454
And so as she is approaching
that, she started the wonder.

346fc303-bd52-46b1-bc86-94e2baaab3a1-3
00:27:39.454 --> 00:27:43.419
You know who who could live
here? Is this for me or did I

346fc303-bd52-46b1-bc86-94e2baaab3a1-4
00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:47.862
enter someone's world? What lies
behind this gate that I'm about

346fc303-bd52-46b1-bc86-94e2baaab3a1-5
00:27:47.862 --> 00:27:48.820
to go through?

010f64ad-3384-4100-853c-6967f5086f5c-0
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.696
How cool. So as as she went
through this, this castle kind

010f64ad-3384-4100-853c-6967f5086f5c-1
00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:04.810
of has waterways that act like
roads and elevators. And so she.

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-0
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.776
She gets in through the gate and
she's going through, you know,

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-1
00:28:09.776 --> 00:28:13.851
those those log rides that they
have at like at Six Flags or

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-2
00:28:13.851 --> 00:28:18.194
amusement park where it's like a
a water slide and you're in the

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-3
00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:22.136
thing and it's got water, but
it's it's like one of those,

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-4
00:28:22.136 --> 00:28:26.345
it's a large wide water slide,
but you ride in a vessel to get

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-5
00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:30.621
around on it. And so she's up in
these things. She's at the tip

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-6
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:34.964
top of all these buildings still
in her boat going through these

9ad5b7c7-ca11-4869-8063-435975b58bf5-7
00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:35.900
kind of water.

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-0
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.522
Streets. And she comes upon some
guards, and they're dressed in

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-1
00:28:40.522 --> 00:28:44.789
an olive Gray, and they have
kind of reddish salmon sashes,

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-2
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:49.128
and they're all waving to her.
And on the other side, we see

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-3
00:28:49.128 --> 00:28:53.681
another person in some sort of
gondola style who's using a long

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-4
00:28:53.681 --> 00:28:58.162
stick to push themselves in the
water, and they're approaching

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-5
00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:02.572
kind of a similar area to her,
just one level lower than what

c043c27b-c03e-4df7-a283-99c121feb30b-6
00:29:02.572 --> 00:29:03.070
she is.

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-0
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.547
So she continues to kind of go
down. You can see the people and

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-1
00:29:11.547 --> 00:29:15.125
their gondolas, looks like the
people who are pushing the

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-2
00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:18.764
gondolas works there. And then
there are patrons inside of

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-3
00:29:18.764 --> 00:29:22.465
them. They look wealthy given
that they have large hats and

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-4
00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:26.289
umbrellas. But this little girl
is still in her, her red boat

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-5
00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:30.298
that she drew. And so she comes
to the end of the street way and

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-6
00:29:30.298 --> 00:29:33.938
she realizes it's a large
waterfall at the end and her the

80c782d4-8084-4ebe-b73a-dd9d0e910013-7
00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:34.740
front of her.

f8e26471-ef38-4637-beae-dfa468e98ea6-0
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.627
So it starts to tip over and the
guards, you're just waving at

f8e26471-ef38-4637-beae-dfa468e98ea6-1
00:29:40.627 --> 00:29:44.777
her like bye, good luck. So she
she ticks off the end and as

f8e26471-ef38-4637-beae-dfa468e98ea6-2
00:29:44.777 --> 00:29:49.201
she's falling she begins to draw
a circle. So we see her mid air

f8e26471-ef38-4637-beae-dfa468e98ea6-3
00:29:49.201 --> 00:29:53.420
drawing the circle as her boat
falls out from underneath her.

6f3c0404-6661-4785-8f0a-9492bc6c3577-0
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.000
Well, that was smart, so.

cec9b930-e690-4d99-bfda-2d99507987d7-0
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.360
So as she she was falling, she
actually managed to draw herself

cec9b930-e690-4d99-bfda-2d99507987d7-1
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.460
a hot air balloon.

a245865c-b112-4b1b-b0e4-7229a676916c-0
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.787
And so it caught her and she now
she's in this large red hot air

a245865c-b112-4b1b-b0e4-7229a676916c-1
00:30:12.787 --> 00:30:17.087
balloon. She's standing in the
basket and she's waving to the

a245865c-b112-4b1b-b0e4-7229a676916c-2
00:30:17.087 --> 00:30:21.594
guards. The guards look a little
perplexed that this girl didn't

a245865c-b112-4b1b-b0e4-7229a676916c-3
00:30:21.594 --> 00:30:25.894
kind of fall to her, her watery
death, but she floats away in

a245865c-b112-4b1b-b0e4-7229a676916c-4
00:30:25.894 --> 00:30:30.124
this red balloon and as she
starts to kind of get high above

a245865c-b112-4b1b-b0e4-7229a676916c-5
00:30:30.124 --> 00:30:33.800
the clouds, we notice this
almost steampunk machine.

86d4d73e-79a7-49fd-a0bb-c55831ca8d57-0
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.200
In the sky it's Gray. In color
it's got, you know.

179c6d6a-2ffe-4c59-9306-89e9adb4f53e-0
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.070
Almost in the shape of like a
semi automatic weapon.

f9b706b0-6cd9-4f94-a580-d6726414c22a-0
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.820
Which is kind of scary.

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-0
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:52.665
But it's got like a long tail
that sticks out from the end and

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-1
00:30:52.665 --> 00:30:57.220
then it's got a wider side that
looks like it has some windows

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-2
00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.558
and then it's got like a water
wheel or some sort of what I

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-3
00:31:01.558 --> 00:31:05.391
imagine, you know those
Mississippi River boats that

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-4
00:31:05.391 --> 00:31:09.584
pushes water. It's got one of
those on its bottom and two

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-5
00:31:09.584 --> 00:31:14.140
large steam towers at the top.
And so there's a couple smaller

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-6
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.478
aircraft around it and it looks
like she's floating towards

2cc5edd3-bd8e-411d-a6b8-8033d8a0ab34-7
00:31:18.478 --> 00:31:18.840
this.

1158f092-922a-4fef-a78f-9ca3e6b6968a-0
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.320
Steampunk.

bab9e1b7-c299-47cd-94bd-8ceb8bbe0180-0
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.550
Aircraft, yeah.

da40a06b-6585-47f5-9188-5f87d420533f-0
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.727
So as she gets closer, she sees
people are being held up in

da40a06b-6585-47f5-9188-5f87d420533f-1
00:31:30.727 --> 00:31:35.147
these smaller aircraft by kind
of oblong balloons that have a

da40a06b-6585-47f5-9188-5f87d420533f-2
00:31:35.147 --> 00:31:38.926
propeller at the bottom and
they're kind of dangling

da40a06b-6585-47f5-9188-5f87d420533f-3
00:31:38.926 --> 00:31:43.061
underneath. And there's a
person, it looks like some sort

da40a06b-6585-47f5-9188-5f87d420533f-4
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:47.695
of either guard or royalty from
the castle. And then there are a

da40a06b-6585-47f5-9188-5f87d420533f-5
00:31:47.695 --> 00:31:51.260
couple other people who look
like maybe servants.

8b2a7450-099f-4f49-b1e2-153b1d6b828e-0
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:56.351
And the little girl's watching
it, they're kind of carrying out

8b2a7450-099f-4f49-b1e2-153b1d6b828e-1
00:31:56.351 --> 00:32:00.374
their their duties. And it looks
like the servants are attempting

8b2a7450-099f-4f49-b1e2-153b1d6b828e-2
00:32:00.374 --> 00:32:03.971
to capture a mystical bird of
sorts. It's purple with long

8b2a7450-099f-4f49-b1e2-153b1d6b828e-3
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:07.080
tail feathers as it kind of
soars through the air.

4fa4fc89-a06c-4cef-bce5-a1694be94357-0
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.670
And we can still see that that
steampunk.

465af8fb-78b2-4a26-a53a-66d2433b3cf6-0
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.495
Aircraft in the background,
she's just kind of looking on,

465af8fb-78b2-4a26-a53a-66d2433b3cf6-1
00:32:16.495 --> 00:32:19.972
kind of wondering what's going
on. So yeah, that's where we're

465af8fb-78b2-4a26-a53a-66d2433b3cf6-2
00:32:19.972 --> 00:32:20.690
at right now.

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-0
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.393
So here we just get a better
look at this aircraft. It looks

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-1
00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:31.897
like the the one boat that was
getting close to capturing that,

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-2
00:32:31.897 --> 00:32:35.979
that Purple Bird managed to do
so. And it looks like it's

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-3
00:32:35.979 --> 00:32:39.991
inside some sort of glass
container and they're lowering

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-4
00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:44.354
it down onto the steampunk ship
and there are some guards who

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-5
00:32:44.354 --> 00:32:48.647
are kind of taking it into the
vessel. And again, the little

57efc1c1-dafc-44ed-a11c-f81ba02d7870-6
00:32:48.647 --> 00:32:52.730
girl is just kind of looking on
as all this is happening.

7bf63137-e4b9-4ef4-a0bd-0b531c04ae16-0
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.826
And you can see that the the
ship is still moving, the

7bf63137-e4b9-4ef4-a0bd-0b531c04ae16-1
00:32:56.826 --> 00:32:58.480
propellers are still working.

6dae7e48-5653-4731-98d4-363aabebffb9-0
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.620
But yeah, it looks like they
captured this bird.

aa1ec667-5a83-4b28-ab15-e270887f7df7-0
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.430
Uh, so the girl gets closer and
she lands her.

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-0
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.024
Hot air balloon on the vessel
and she starts to kind of mosey

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-1
00:33:15.024 --> 00:33:19.022
around and see what's going on.
So she runs down a walkway and

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-2
00:33:19.022 --> 00:33:23.210
there's a door at the end of the
walkway and it looks like what's

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-3
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:27.081
on a submarine, you know, a
metal door that latches and it's

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-4
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:30.698
kind of sealed, so it's pretty
secure, but she's heading

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-5
00:33:30.698 --> 00:33:34.252
towards that. There's a bridge
at the top where men are

c1566a5c-055d-4034-b2f8-b95af14a3f8c-6
00:33:34.252 --> 00:33:34.760
walking.

e157968e-1dd7-48b2-8b91-3ddfb84ebe27-0
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.860
She's trying to get inside and
so we get over to this.

d142acd9-3ac4-4d93-857c-ff7aa1a66bc7-0
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.296
It looks like what's in the
Forbidden City kind of that

d142acd9-3ac4-4d93-857c-ff7aa1a66bc7-1
00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:49.681
style roofing. It's got a dragon
on the top, and it's gold, and

d142acd9-3ac4-4d93-857c-ff7aa1a66bc7-2
00:33:49.681 --> 00:33:53.655
underneath it there's some
silver with two guards. And in

d142acd9-3ac4-4d93-857c-ff7aa1a66bc7-3
00:33:53.655 --> 00:33:57.561
the center is that bird in a
cage. And when you see this

d142acd9-3ac4-4d93-857c-ff7aa1a66bc7-4
00:33:57.561 --> 00:34:01.466
little girl with her, her
writing utensil still in hand,

d142acd9-3ac4-4d93-857c-ff7aa1a66bc7-5
00:34:01.466 --> 00:34:04.550
walking up the ladder to get
near this bird.

83fadcec-e2f1-405f-881d-c30aede97930-0
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:09.930
Ohh she's.

a7c87ac9-e4fd-4156-82a6-fe58cb0d5c6b-0
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.450
she snatched it. So she.

de6b3937-cad4-4d14-96ff-d56f8defc1bb-0
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.022
We see that the little girl
actually decided to take the

de6b3937-cad4-4d14-96ff-d56f8defc1bb-1
00:34:18.022 --> 00:34:18.360
bird.

efdb54bc-48ed-4354-8ea9-86671277ea94-0
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.074
And she she grabbed it in its
cage and went running. And the

efdb54bc-48ed-4354-8ea9-86671277ea94-1
00:34:24.074 --> 00:34:26.530
guards see this and they're
like, sorry.

5d940af1-9f71-4663-a2bc-b8bcdbaac02e-0
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:32.601
Yeah, the the guards, you know,
they shouted at her. {They're

5d940af1-9f71-4663-a2bc-b8bcdbaac02e-1
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:36.110
playing nicely. My dog is just
very noisy when he plays.}

1183cc9c-632a-412d-ae83-cf7b14a1e37b-0
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.020
Uh.

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-0
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.752
The guards are kind of chasing
after her. She, she climbs down

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-1
00:34:43.752 --> 00:34:47.269
and she's running through the
whole ship and she gets out to

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-2
00:34:47.269 --> 00:34:51.074
this bottom area where it's very
narrow, and she runs to the tail

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-3
00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:54.591
end of it. She opens the cage
and she releases this bird and

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-4
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:58.281
it kind of flies away. I think
she could kind of tell that this

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-5
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:01.798
bird was kind of like a pure
creature that didn't deserve to

ce74e130-719b-4b70-97ef-aa2ebb7aaf00-6
00:35:01.798 --> 00:35:02.490
be captured.

b5d408a2-02ff-4249-a04b-143e7a82db47-0
00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:12.407
So the guards grabbed the little
girl. We see now what looks like

b5d408a2-02ff-4249-a04b-143e7a82db47-1
00:35:12.407 --> 00:35:16.795
some sort of Emperor or Prince
or king kind of standing over

b5d408a2-02ff-4249-a04b-143e7a82db47-2
00:35:16.795 --> 00:35:20.680
her, commanding her as the
guards are yanking on her.

75f5c10c-8f0f-4c84-932d-41f5ff631a3a-0
00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.361
And as they're doing this, she
drops her writing utensil and

75f5c10c-8f0f-4c84-932d-41f5ff631a3a-1
00:35:24.361 --> 00:35:24.510
so.

8fe52524-812b-43fa-afe1-3daf7448173c-0
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.840
She's kind of stuck and the
guards put her in this cage and

8fe52524-812b-43fa-afe1-3daf7448173c-1
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.432
dangle her underneath the
propeller of the ship, so she's

8fe52524-812b-43fa-afe1-3daf7448173c-2
00:35:35.432 --> 00:35:38.520
hanging underneath in what looks
like.

aeca9b9b-3812-4e85-ba88-1405753cc014-0
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.764
I don't even know. You know, the
movie Hocus Pocus where she puts

aeca9b9b-3812-4e85-ba88-1405753cc014-1
00:35:43.764 --> 00:35:47.225
those boys into those cages and
spins around? She's in one of

aeca9b9b-3812-4e85-ba88-1405753cc014-2
00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:50.687
those, but she's hanging like 20
feet underneath the ship and

aeca9b9b-3812-4e85-ba88-1405753cc014-3
00:35:50.687 --> 00:35:54.315
she's peering over the edge and
she's stuck because she's way up

aeca9b9b-3812-4e85-ba88-1405753cc014-4
00:35:54.315 --> 00:35:54.930
in the air.

120b3d1b-bde3-468f-8eae-396c06ec3faa-0
00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.145
The little girl's, you know, in
here. And then she starts to see

120b3d1b-bde3-468f-8eae-396c06ec3faa-1
00:36:02.145 --> 00:36:04.946
that the magical bird, well, we
don't know if it's magical. I

120b3d1b-bde3-468f-8eae-396c06ec3faa-2
00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:05.940
decided that just now.

d45a50bd-fa1f-40ec-beb4-5b3d590fe282-0
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.678
Is flying towards her, and at
the gets closer she realizes

d45a50bd-fa1f-40ec-beb4-5b3d590fe282-1
00:36:12.678 --> 00:36:16.696
that this bird has her her
writing utensil in its beak. So

d45a50bd-fa1f-40ec-beb4-5b3d590fe282-2
00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:20.919
the girl cheers and she she's
very excited and the bird comes

d45a50bd-fa1f-40ec-beb4-5b3d590fe282-3
00:36:20.919 --> 00:36:24.938
by her and it sits on her
shoulder. It's hovering over her

d45a50bd-fa1f-40ec-beb4-5b3d590fe282-4
00:36:24.938 --> 00:36:29.160
as she starts to draw, and as
the bird watches, she continues

d45a50bd-fa1f-40ec-beb4-5b3d590fe282-5
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.520
to draw. And they kind of built
a friendship because this bird.

36f0699e-7019-42d3-94aa-86659253cd34-0
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.770
Was rescued by this girl and now
it's getting to return the favor

36f0699e-7019-42d3-94aa-86659253cd34-1
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.130
to her.

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-0
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.348
The little girl drew a rectangle
and as we find out, this

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-1
00:36:47.348 --> 00:36:51.564
rectangle was actually a magic
carpet, so she hopped on this

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-2
00:36:51.564 --> 00:36:55.572
red magic carpet. It's got
little fringe on the front and

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-3
00:36:55.572 --> 00:36:59.857
the back and she starts to soar
through the sky, over the the

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-4
00:36:59.857 --> 00:37:04.073
castle, you can see clouds and
it looks like it's turning to

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-5
00:37:04.073 --> 00:37:08.151
dusk. Now the sun is setting,
turning into night time, and

cc45eabe-453b-444d-9e2e-1d5189563322-6
00:37:08.151 --> 00:37:10.570
she's she's following the
magical.

9a9c258d-f659-47b3-8462-49cb155cf99b-0
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.596
Word is they kind of soar
through this this world that she

9a9c258d-f659-47b3-8462-49cb155cf99b-1
00:37:13.596 --> 00:37:15.500
still doesn't really know what
it is.

db6ab0e6-067e-4c5d-82d8-82e989ef06dc-0
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.050
The night time is beginning to
fall. The stars are coming out.

b0848874-761d-4084-833a-7b9e17c07cd8-0
00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.070
There's I'm not sure if she's in
the same area now. There's what

b0848874-761d-4084-833a-7b9e17c07cd8-1
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.327
looks like more of like a
Moroccan style castle on the

b0848874-761d-4084-833a-7b9e17c07cd8-2
00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:34.644
left side of the page, and the
night is starry and it's

b0848874-761d-4084-833a-7b9e17c07cd8-3
00:37:34.644 --> 00:37:37.783
glimmering and there's some
shallow mountains in the

b0848874-761d-4084-833a-7b9e17c07cd8-4
00:37:37.783 --> 00:37:41.515
background and she just kind of
soaring through the air with a

b0848874-761d-4084-833a-7b9e17c07cd8-5
00:37:41.515 --> 00:37:45.010
lone palm tree following this
magical bird into the night.

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-0
00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.894
So they land on the sand, and
this right beside that lone palm

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-1
00:37:54.894 --> 00:37:58.785
tree. And as she gets closer,
she realizes there's a small

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-2
00:37:58.785 --> 00:38:02.676
purple door at the base of it.
And the bird kind of stands

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-3
00:38:02.676 --> 00:38:06.303
proudly at it, almost, um
encouraging her to approach.

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-4
00:38:06.303 --> 00:38:10.589
This little girl gets up to the
the door, the bird kind of takes

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-5
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:14.546
flight and the bird flies in and
the little girl crawls and

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-6
00:38:14.546 --> 00:38:18.568
afterwards, and it's a small
door, like a Coraline door that

f4f73e7a-53ff-4f8b-8c05-fcff62fcc684-7
00:38:18.568 --> 00:38:19.690
she goes through.

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-0
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.828
And as they crawl out, she
crawls out of what is the side

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-1
00:38:27.828 --> 00:38:31.639
of one of those blue mailbox
bins that you see on city

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-2
00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:35.865
streets. So it's that shape. And
she crawls out and the bird

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-3
00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:40.230
flies right towards the little
boy that we had talked about in

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-4
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:44.318
the beginning. And we realized
that he is holding a purple

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-5
00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:48.613
writing utensil. And as we crawl
out, the little girl and the

9e25f5fc-2d34-427a-a697-0b1e7a0f70eb-6
00:38:48.613 --> 00:38:49.930
little boy kind of.

0be09d40-d8a4-46e4-acba-069c94cc50a8-0
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.405
meet. And he helped her up, and
we realized that the little boy

0be09d40-d8a4-46e4-acba-069c94cc50a8-1
00:38:53.405 --> 00:38:56.758
must have sent this bird to the
little girl. And so she begins

0be09d40-d8a4-46e4-acba-069c94cc50a8-2
00:38:56.758 --> 00:38:58.940
to draw a circle, and he draws a
circle.

39ca6140-3dba-4c99-b633-5537f1aeec64-0
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.739
And those two circles are used
to create a double bicycle that

39ca6140-3dba-4c99-b633-5537f1aeec64-1
00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:10.183
they then ride on together while
the magical bird follows them.

39ca6140-3dba-4c99-b633-5537f1aeec64-2
00:39:10.183 --> 00:39:13.627
And they're on the the regular
city streets that we began on in

39ca6140-3dba-4c99-b633-5537f1aeec64-3
00:39:13.627 --> 00:39:15.080
the beginning. #END_journey

2c95d4e2-9831-4965-be0d-ab4e915e89d4-0
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.212
Alright, so that was that item
and now let's take the 10 minute

2c95d4e2-9831-4965-be0d-ab4e915e89d4-1
00:39:21.212 --> 00:39:21.650
break.

2b90adcd-37c2-4e24-a64f-8fe04595c4f3-0
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.370
We can come back at 10:10, OK. I
mean not.

8da5b0b0-e5ea-4989-ab43-b09ea872cd05-0
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.860
It's so cute.

6c70e733-6b57-42d4-8a40-46fd331629e7-0
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.740
We're going to the next item,
OK.

3774bd84-9011-4aae-8170-5b3a0ea15912-0
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.501
I can switch the screen again.
This is a wordless picture book

3774bd84-9011-4aae-8170-5b3a0ea15912-1
00:39:43.501 --> 00:39:45.510
which tells a story. So.

a4ad1437-9e86-430e-88a7-ad1b6beb52b1-0
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.870
Describe it in detail, yeah.

5e254602-cb49-4f67-8961-bfb04b148316-0
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.404
Start whenever you're ready.
#START_flowerman OK, so this

5e254602-cb49-4f67-8961-bfb04b148316-1
00:39:54.404 --> 00:39:56.920
story is set in kind of a spooky
setting.

14a73c15-5830-4a82-8ceb-de650bec51b3-0
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:04.311
The setting of the story, like
the the backdrop, is all black

14a73c15-5830-4a82-8ceb-de650bec51b3-1
00:40:04.311 --> 00:40:05.210
and white.

17fc1e00-f68f-4651-a1ae-25f66acc4080-0
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.050
With the.

ea3f973b-670c-4a5a-a2e5-8092dfeac801-0
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.810
We see a small village of shops.

6bf57d79-ed19-4004-88b6-70663037afc8-0
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.764
We see a bait shop, a bar, a gas
station, and then we see

6bf57d79-ed19-4004-88b6-70663037afc8-1
00:40:16.764 --> 00:40:19.793
probably some apartment
buildings, a little Ferris

6bf57d79-ed19-4004-88b6-70663037afc8-2
00:40:19.793 --> 00:40:20.150
wheel.

caeb55a5-d26a-427d-9620-ff0bd5c23a59-0
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.199
There's a big at the front,
there's a a big ditch, and it

caeb55a5-d26a-427d-9620-ff0bd5c23a59-1
00:40:26.199 --> 00:40:30.705
almost looks like a lake that's
been drained. And then there's a

caeb55a5-d26a-427d-9620-ff0bd5c23a59-2
00:40:30.705 --> 00:40:34.724
small bridge on the left with
four lampposts and the dead

caeb55a5-d26a-427d-9620-ff0bd5c23a59-3
00:40:34.724 --> 00:40:39.230
tree. And on that bridge we see
a man, and this man is in color.

01be1109-3ed3-4e07-bb2b-0ce11edd0c56-0
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:45.285
And I think it's a man. We'll
find out. But they are, they are

01be1109-3ed3-4e07-bb2b-0ce11edd0c56-1
00:40:45.285 --> 00:40:49.861
wearing, we'll call it, they're
wearing a green coat and a hat

01be1109-3ed3-4e07-bb2b-0ce11edd0c56-2
00:40:49.861 --> 00:40:54.582
and they have a glow about them.
And the other part of the story

01be1109-3ed3-4e07-bb2b-0ce11edd0c56-3
00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:59.303
that's in color is the sky. And
so the sky is a deep purple with

01be1109-3ed3-4e07-bb2b-0ce11edd0c56-4
00:40:59.303 --> 00:41:03.806
kind of pinkish clouds. And so
we see this man or woman going

01be1109-3ed3-4e07-bb2b-0ce11edd0c56-5
00:41:03.806 --> 00:41:07.219
over the bridge and heading
towards this town.

bf9570d8-628c-4579-829f-53027470a694-0
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.750
So as this person approaches the
town, they're now walking the

bf9570d8-628c-4579-829f-53027470a694-1
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.960
streets and we're getting kind
of a better view for the town.

30a79ba8-60d6-4349-a616-3e8a4509b7d8-0
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:24.267
The streets are made of stone,
the sidewalks are of more of

30a79ba8-60d6-4349-a616-3e8a4509b7d8-1
00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:28.336
like a slatestone, and they're
walking down the street we see

30a79ba8-60d6-4349-a616-3e8a4509b7d8-2
00:41:28.336 --> 00:41:32.142
in hand. They have a bag of
something and an umbrella, it

30a79ba8-60d6-4349-a616-3e8a4509b7d8-3
00:41:32.142 --> 00:41:36.277
looks like, and we're starting
to get kind of more pictures of

30a79ba8-60d6-4349-a616-3e8a4509b7d8-4
00:41:36.277 --> 00:41:38.639
some of the townspeople. So we
see.

53cb28cd-de45-4b42-bf84-8c6be0fc0168-0
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.782
Two men on the left, one in a
ribbed white tank top, the other

53cb28cd-de45-4b42-bf84-8c6be0fc0168-1
00:41:44.782 --> 00:41:50.442
in a striped shirts. We see some
people in a cafe and through the

53cb28cd-de45-4b42-bf84-8c6be0fc0168-2
00:41:50.442 --> 00:41:53.530
windows we see a man driving a
car.

93a380bc-cc9a-4512-93a9-300b29dd41ea-0
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:57.992
A person on a motorcycle and a
person on the balcony, and so we

93a380bc-cc9a-4512-93a9-300b29dd41ea-1
00:41:57.992 --> 00:42:01.494
aren't really quite sure where
the story is heading yet, but we

93a380bc-cc9a-4512-93a9-300b29dd41ea-2
00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:04.887
do know that this person, who
remains in color while the rest

93a380bc-cc9a-4512-93a9-300b29dd41ea-3
00:42:04.887 --> 00:42:08.280
of the town remains in black and
white, is entering the town.

bf1da933-644b-4366-aa6d-aac840e09368-0
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.010
So the person.

758d926a-afe1-441d-b493-02d5a18856d0-0
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:25.430
{Creatures} first approaches a
building, and it's a little more

758d926a-afe1-441d-b493-02d5a18856d0-1
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.063
rundown than the other
buildings. It's also not as

758d926a-afe1-441d-b493-02d5a18856d0-2
00:42:29.063 --> 00:42:29.420
tall.

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-0
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:34.542
Umm, it looks more so the the
other buildings are more

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-1
00:42:34.542 --> 00:42:38.590
apartment style, multiple
stories, narrow, several windows

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-2
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:43.048
where this building is small and
more house like and the yard is

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-3
00:42:43.048 --> 00:42:47.164
unkempt and there's a small
picket fence around it and they

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-4
00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:51.486
are approaching this house. We
see the other villagers kind of

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-5
00:42:51.486 --> 00:42:55.396
going about their lives, some
people up in some windows,

ef8acf84-3a04-42a3-b876-4d8733b77849-6
00:42:55.396 --> 00:42:58.139
people having a chat around a
fountain.

71adab78-f404-4494-a7b3-b78cca232791-0
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.665
And that's kind of where we're
at. He's standing at the person

71adab78-f404-4494-a7b3-b78cca232791-1
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:07.673
is standing on the corner
underneath some lamp light

71adab78-f404-4494-a7b3-b78cca232791-2
00:43:07.673 --> 00:43:11.420
outside of this, this small home
in the center of this busy town.

59bf21cc-3c8f-45f0-94ce-8f5281aa655d-0
00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.500
So it is now daytime.

07bd7263-2094-4ff7-8889-28613867bf73-0
00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:25.018
The sky is, uh, a bright blue.
There's some white puffy clouds,

07bd7263-2094-4ff7-8889-28613867bf73-1
00:43:25.018 --> 00:43:29.773
and we see now that not only is
that person who we discovered

07bd7263-2094-4ff7-8889-28613867bf73-2
00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:30.769
now is a man.

255c3f30-74e4-4295-8422-c41ae8a0a7f2-0
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.678
Not only is he in color, but the
whole home that he approached is

255c3f30-74e4-4295-8422-c41ae8a0a7f2-1
00:43:37.678 --> 00:43:41.713
also in color. So the roof of
this home is purple. It's got

255c3f30-74e4-4295-8422-c41ae8a0a7f2-2
00:43:41.713 --> 00:43:42.050
some.

0a22d302-d3cc-4263-b594-4be1ddb9b120-0
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.976
Big windows up in the attic
space that have gold crossbars

0a22d302-d3cc-4263-b594-4be1ddb9b120-1
00:43:47.976 --> 00:43:52.943
and almost like a stained
quality that's blue. The door is

0a22d302-d3cc-4263-b594-4be1ddb9b120-2
00:43:52.943 --> 00:43:54.290
a tannish color.

51788a2d-2f52-496f-890c-b4a1ac8d2f46-0
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:59.030
The the shutters are blue.
There's a red lawn mower in the

51788a2d-2f52-496f-890c-b4a1ac8d2f46-1
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.370
yard.

c5a46270-8eda-4b37-bbd7-c4c292b16d03-0
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.575
Um, some cobblestones and some
green grass, and the villagers

c5a46270-8eda-4b37-bbd7-c4c292b16d03-1
00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:08.849
are all kind of going by. A
little girl that's peering over

c5a46270-8eda-4b37-bbd7-c4c292b16d03-2
00:44:08.849 --> 00:44:13.407
looking at this man's home, and
there is a large, almost like a

c5a46270-8eda-4b37-bbd7-c4c292b16d03-3
00:44:13.407 --> 00:44:17.610
cherry blossom tree that has a
red glow to it in the yard.

22cf4a25-051a-4bd8-abe5-0399dbfd755a-0
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.837
Until we aren't quite sure
what's going to happen yet, but

22cf4a25-051a-4bd8-abe5-0399dbfd755a-1
00:44:21.837 --> 00:44:24.934
it does seem like the villagers
are potentially interested in

22cf4a25-051a-4bd8-abe5-0399dbfd755a-2
00:44:24.934 --> 00:44:28.180
this man and his colorful place.
The rest of the village remains

22cf4a25-051a-4bd8-abe5-0399dbfd755a-3
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.130
in black and white.

bbb5f211-7a04-4b4c-bcea-4f4ef7d1eb8e-0
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.279
The color now is even more
vibrant than it was on the

bbb5f211-7a04-4b4c-bcea-4f4ef7d1eb8e-1
00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:38.220
previous page.

918a926c-ccf4-4f4f-b897-fdeee17b099e-0
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:43.268
It appears that he was maybe
fixing it up and getting it even

918a926c-ccf4-4f4f-b897-fdeee17b099e-1
00:44:43.268 --> 00:44:46.888
even better than it was. And we
see now that the little girl

918a926c-ccf4-4f4f-b897-fdeee17b099e-2
00:44:46.888 --> 00:44:50.388
that had been interested in
peering over his fence is also

918a926c-ccf4-4f4f-b897-fdeee17b099e-3
00:44:50.388 --> 00:44:51.160
in color now.

3ebd9b0f-7c51-423b-a953-e61fa3435d9c-0
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.791
She's walking down the street
away from his home and she's

3ebd9b0f-7c51-423b-a953-e61fa3435d9c-1
00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:56.860
holding something.

10beeb66-cab1-48e6-87e7-53291b8f22ef-0
00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.572
I'm not entirely sure what it is
and the man remains at his home

10beeb66-cab1-48e6-87e7-53291b8f22ef-1
00:45:02.572 --> 00:45:05.720
and he's either planting some
daisies or just.

d50fa7ed-a104-45bb-af29-b960c5ecc483-0
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:08.240
Trimming them up.

98c97c53-768f-4566-8beb-484837ada14e-0
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.170
And he's waving to the little
girl.

5bd062ce-9b74-4a6e-9362-55b745c38a20-0
00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.140
And the rest of the townspeople
remain.

7f606ba1-bbc2-4bc5-8411-999c1ff616ae-0
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.081
Going about their lives in black
and white. And so we now have

7f606ba1-bbc2-4bc5-8411-999c1ff616ae-1
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:22.588
two characters who are in color,
and this man's home is bright,

7f606ba1-bbc2-4bc5-8411-999c1ff616ae-2
00:45:22.588 --> 00:45:25.985
and it doesn't look nearly as
shabby as it originally did. So

7f606ba1-bbc2-4bc5-8411-999c1ff616ae-3
00:45:25.985 --> 00:45:28.944
it's it's getting a lot
brighter, and it's neater and

7f606ba1-bbc2-4bc5-8411-999c1ff616ae-4
00:45:28.944 --> 00:45:30.150
it's cleaner and it's.

57be17fb-0095-4d9d-a9f4-37a9996c6fb4-0
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.420
Kind of looking fantastic and I
would like to live there.

3ebaf461-f559-4207-99cd-151ca83decdd-0
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.518
So now we start to see on the
next page that the color is

3ebaf461-f559-4207-99cd-151ca83decdd-1
00:45:41.518 --> 00:45:44.998
beginning to spread. We see the
original little girl hugging

3ebaf461-f559-4207-99cd-151ca83decdd-2
00:45:44.998 --> 00:45:47.280
some other man and he is also in
color.

f4c5458f-1a18-4ba8-928c-ad8a5c4d555c-0
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.961
A quarter of the apartment
buildings we're finding now has

f4c5458f-1a18-4ba8-928c-ad8a5c4d555c-1
00:45:52.961 --> 00:45:56.263
red brick, and up in that red
brick there's a man, and he's in

f4c5458f-1a18-4ba8-928c-ad8a5c4d555c-2
00:45:56.263 --> 00:45:59.512
color, and that building has
purple and white awnings. And to

f4c5458f-1a18-4ba8-928c-ad8a5c4d555c-3
00:45:59.512 --> 00:46:02.866
the right of that there's a man
coming out of another building,

f4c5458f-1a18-4ba8-928c-ad8a5c4d555c-4
00:46:02.866 --> 00:46:04.910
and he has orange walls on the
inside.

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-0
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.597
And more and more people are
interacting with this old man

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-1
00:46:09.597 --> 00:46:13.470
who was originally in color. And
so it seems that as people

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-2
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:17.472
interact and kind of talk and
work and meet with this man and

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-3
00:46:17.472 --> 00:46:21.150
maybe interact with each other
more, the color begins to

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-4
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:25.217
spread. So we see all sorts of
beautiful colors going on here.

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-5
00:46:25.217 --> 00:46:29.024
We start to notice that the
roots on a lot of these houses

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-6
00:46:29.024 --> 00:46:33.026
are multiple colors, four or
five different colors slates and

6e65c1ff-12ee-472c-a0be-070719d686ac-7
00:46:33.026 --> 00:46:36.060
kind of creating a mosaic
pattern on the roof.

aa9f8e28-5695-4843-a38f-eaa121756f65-0
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.260
Um.

0cd37620-f0f9-4e36-ae1d-913e65149cac-0
00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:42.400
But I would say maybe 25% of the
town is in color and the rest

0cd37620-f0f9-4e36-ae1d-913e65149cac-1
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.759
remains in black and white. And
so there's still a lot of color

0cd37620-f0f9-4e36-ae1d-913e65149cac-2
00:46:46.759 --> 00:46:51.050
to be had. But the old man who
was originally in color remains

0cd37620-f0f9-4e36-ae1d-913e65149cac-3
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.728
to be talking to the
townspeople, and the townspeople

0cd37620-f0f9-4e36-ae1d-913e65149cac-4
00:46:54.728 --> 00:46:56.839
are talking to one another, so.

fca61ada-0844-4adb-82c6-31a0faf814cd-0
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.760
It's.

8b736a62-c633-4957-897a-079dbee759f5-0
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.932
So now the whole town is in
color, it is bright and

8b736a62-c633-4957-897a-079dbee759f5-1
00:47:04.932 --> 00:47:09.134
brilliant and it looks very
happy. And so originally the

8b736a62-c633-4957-897a-079dbee759f5-2
00:47:09.134 --> 00:47:13.556
town looked very glum and sad
and like I said it was spooky

8b736a62-c633-4957-897a-079dbee759f5-3
00:47:13.556 --> 00:47:18.347
looking. And now this town looks
like something out of the movie

8b736a62-c633-4957-897a-079dbee759f5-4
00:47:18.347 --> 00:47:18.790
Bruno.

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-0
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.809
{That's such a cute movie,} but
it's, you know, it's it's

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-1
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:26.947
bright, it's brilliant. People
are hanging from their windows,

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-2
00:47:26.947 --> 00:47:29.736
there's color everywhere,
there's people in the streets

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-3
00:47:29.736 --> 00:47:32.874
talking and hanging out. It just
looks like a fun place to be.

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-4
00:47:32.874 --> 00:47:35.913
The old man is grilling up in
his front yard, and there's an

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-5
00:47:35.913 --> 00:47:38.703
old lady and a small child
there. And then we see other

ee074f6c-4e84-4489-a6a6-7a73f4925ffe-6
00:47:38.703 --> 00:47:39.499
people mingling.

dc21d37f-3c37-40aa-ac35-715605671146-0
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:40.910
Umm.

e5ea96a0-c0f1-44ab-98d3-0fb332dc8b13-0
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:45.038
And it just looks like a really
happy place to be. Everyone

e5ea96a0-c0f1-44ab-98d3-0fb332dc8b13-1
00:47:45.038 --> 00:47:48.376
seems to be enjoying themselves
a lot more than they were, they

e5ea96a0-c0f1-44ab-98d3-0fb332dc8b13-2
00:47:48.376 --> 00:47:51.400
seem to be interacting a lot
more than they were, and the

e5ea96a0-c0f1-44ab-98d3-0fb332dc8b13-3
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.330
color is nice and bright
everywhere.

18ced7c1-4865-4af1-923b-e6eadd1ed7f1-0
00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:02.530
So the day is starting to wind
down. It's getting closer to

18ced7c1-4865-4af1-923b-e6eadd1ed7f1-1
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.149
evening time now. The sky has
gone from a powder blue to more

18ced7c1-4865-4af1-923b-e6eadd1ed7f1-2
00:48:07.149 --> 00:48:11.842
of like the cotton candy you get
at sunset. There's a a larger

18ced7c1-4865-4af1-923b-e6eadd1ed7f1-3
00:48:11.842 --> 00:48:16.685
gentleman on the roof and just a
bath towel doing something. But

18ced7c1-4865-4af1-923b-e6eadd1ed7f1-4
00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:21.006
again, the town. The town
remains happy and it looks like

18ced7c1-4865-4af1-923b-e6eadd1ed7f1-5
00:48:21.006 --> 00:48:24.880
it's a fun place to be. But I'm
seeing this, and I.

a728f974-2bb2-48f0-8429-189edc88bc7c-0
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:29.709
See that the old man has kind of
shut his house. The door is

a728f974-2bb2-48f0-8429-189edc88bc7c-1
00:48:29.709 --> 00:48:30.230
closed.

d7e0eaa3-f908-46cd-940f-7b71314b1f73-0
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.906
And he has packed up and he has
his traveling clothes back on

d7e0eaa3-f908-46cd-940f-7b71314b1f73-1
00:48:34.906 --> 00:48:38.794
that he originally entered the
town and and it looks like he is

d7e0eaa3-f908-46cd-940f-7b71314b1f73-2
00:48:38.794 --> 00:48:39.280
leaving.

3df45f85-7620-4e41-93d9-ea0ea33d65bc-0
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:44.010
So he's exiting stage left right
now.

ac45d93d-85ef-43bf-acaa-a03fb46a518b-0
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.148
So we don't really know why, but
the town is still a happy and

ac45d93d-85ef-43bf-acaa-a03fb46a518b-1
00:48:48.148 --> 00:48:51.592
bright place. But it does appear
that the old man is retiring

ac45d93d-85ef-43bf-acaa-a03fb46a518b-2
00:48:51.592 --> 00:48:52.370
from the town.

948868b7-31cc-4196-b349-9b72531af182-0
00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:59.208
So we begin to follow him as he
leaves. He's kind of going the

948868b7-31cc-4196-b349-9b72531af182-1
00:48:59.208 --> 00:49:02.147
same way he left, and we see
that the whole town, not just

948868b7-31cc-4196-b349-9b72531af182-2
00:49:02.147 --> 00:49:04.040
the part that we had been
looking at.

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-0
00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:08.405
is also in color. So we start to
notice that what was just a

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-1
00:49:08.405 --> 00:49:12.160
single person on the balcony is
now a family. The man on the

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-2
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.977
motorcycle before is stopped in
the street talking to people.

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-3
00:49:15.977 --> 00:49:19.733
And so we see that this color
has spread everywhere and it's

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-4
00:49:19.733 --> 00:49:23.119
impacted everybody up the town
and they're all kind of

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-5
00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:26.813
interacting more. But we still
see this old man leaving the

8e3c8584-8b55-472a-a2dd-c8e5b22f56c3-6
00:49:26.813 --> 00:49:27.860
same way he came.

65c1c8e8-22d9-4840-a232-8966309c1037-0
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.055
And he's now in a different part
of town. And this area of town,

65c1c8e8-22d9-4840-a232-8966309c1037-1
00:49:38.055 --> 00:49:41.908
I'm not sure if it's the same
town. It appears to be so, given

65c1c8e8-22d9-4840-a232-8966309c1037-2
00:49:41.908 --> 00:49:45.578
that the cobblestones of the
street remain the same and the

65c1c8e8-22d9-4840-a232-8966309c1037-3
00:49:45.578 --> 00:49:49.370
sidewalks also remain the same.
But this part of the town is.

8e985d8c-c0ab-4434-80c6-da190f31bf1a-0
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.693
In black and white as the first
one started, and the sky is that

8e985d8c-c0ab-4434-80c6-da190f31bf1a-1
00:49:54.693 --> 00:49:56.260
same purplish dark color.

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-0
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.580
And again, the, the townspeople
look sad. They look kind of

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-1
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.343
sulkin. There's a man sitting by
a fountain, looks like he's he's

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-2
00:50:06.343 --> 00:50:10.818
drinking alone. There's a family
upstairs, I mean in a window

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-3
00:50:10.818 --> 00:50:15.365
smoking a pipe. And we see a for
sale sign in the front of APT

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-4
00:50:15.365 --> 00:50:19.839
19, and there's a dog that is
also in color standing in front

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-5
00:50:19.839 --> 00:50:24.314
of it. And so we see this man
holding what looks like maybe a

492f07b1-d815-4494-a025-cad71572df86-6
00:50:24.314 --> 00:50:27.490
key or a slip of paper that has
an address.

91ee07dd-7eb7-4f11-a891-91140de7cdf6-0
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.500
On it. And he's standing under
the lamplight kind of outside of

91ee07dd-7eb7-4f11-a891-91140de7cdf6-1
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.380
this apartment. And it might be
apt 17, I can't tell. But it's

91ee07dd-7eb7-4f11-a891-91140de7cdf6-2
00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.520
apartment 19 or 17, and
everything is in black and

91ee07dd-7eb7-4f11-a891-91140de7cdf6-3
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.153
white. And this color, full man
is kind of approaching it,

91ee07dd-7eb7-4f11-a891-91140de7cdf6-4
00:50:42.153 --> 00:50:45.540
standing outside of it in a glum
black and white town.

2c290fad-d57b-4b02-872a-dcbcde54f890-0
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:54.509
So he appears to have gone past
the apartment, but he did stop

2c290fad-d57b-4b02-872a-dcbcde54f890-1
00:50:54.509 --> 00:50:59.405
by where the little girl and her
family was and it appears that

2c290fad-d57b-4b02-872a-dcbcde54f890-2
00:50:59.405 --> 00:51:03.689
he gave her a flower, and I
assume maybe this flower is

2c290fad-d57b-4b02-872a-dcbcde54f890-3
00:51:03.689 --> 00:51:07.820
something he brought with him
from his previous home.

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-0
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.021
But he gave this little girl a
flower and she is now in color,

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-1
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:15.282
as is the gentleman in the
window. He is also now in color

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-2
00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:18.764
and they look much happier. But
it appears that the man is not

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-3
00:51:18.764 --> 00:51:22.191
staying and he is continuing to
walk away. But we do have two

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-4
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:25.783
townspeople now who are holding
colorful flowers and are also in

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-5
00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:28.878
color, and they look a lot
happier than they did in the

853eb66a-6b84-40bf-bcf4-8b0903a71608-6
00:51:28.878 --> 00:51:31.199
previous image. #END_flowerman
All right.

0e340794-af5f-4398-a4c7-ee872fd314c5-0
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:36.270
OK. So that was the story and
then?

e3703e11-4c8c-4b38-ad08-a66f8c3bd323-0
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.840
Yes, we can move on to the next
item, which is also a story.

b3bee63e-8958-4c27-b588-e1946e0b9bcc-0
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.350
Oh, never mind. It's a complex
season.

39957a32-f351-4d66-96b2-d23ccd706531-0
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.760
#START_birthday_party_fun OK, so
we've got a big.

a2bf49ce-0fbb-4957-b76f-ecd513fccf82-0
00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.521
Scene and this one is titled Big
Birthday Fun and there's a big

a2bf49ce-0fbb-4957-b76f-ecd513fccf82-1
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:06.397
purple almost post it note shape
on the bottom right hand corner

a2bf49ce-0fbb-4957-b76f-ecd513fccf82-2
00:52:06.397 --> 00:52:11.048
that explains what this scene is
about. It looks like it's in

a2bf49ce-0fbb-4957-b76f-ecd513fccf82-3
00:52:11.048 --> 00:52:15.549
somebody's backyard and it's
kind of a large birthday party

a2bf49ce-0fbb-4957-b76f-ecd513fccf82-4
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:17.200
that's costume themed.

8ba873eb-59cf-42d0-834b-3ae29c69c41a-0
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.026
So in the upper right hand
corner we have an inflatable

8ba873eb-59cf-42d0-834b-3ae29c69c41a-1
00:52:23.026 --> 00:52:27.586
bouncy house that is yellow.
It's shaped like a castle. It's

8ba873eb-59cf-42d0-834b-3ae29c69c41a-2
00:52:27.586 --> 00:52:32.221
got red rooftop and a red ramp
to get on. And then the bouncy

8ba873eb-59cf-42d0-834b-3ae29c69c41a-3
00:52:32.221 --> 00:52:36.781
part is blue and purple and
there are all sorts of people on

8ba873eb-59cf-42d0-834b-3ae29c69c41a-4
00:52:36.781 --> 00:52:41.566
it in various costumes. There's,
you know, someone dressed as a

8ba873eb-59cf-42d0-834b-3ae29c69c41a-5
00:52:41.566 --> 00:52:43.509
rabbit that's pink. a bat.

148016d1-be00-4ded-be80-0c646efe5fb2-0
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.081
Maybe a devil, a milkmaid, a
fairy, a frog, and they're all

148016d1-be00-4ded-be80-0c646efe5fb2-1
00:52:49.081 --> 00:52:50.850
just jumping on it, having fun.

4a6c284a-f36f-43ea-9725-dc0d124cd8f7-0
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.199
We see on the right hand side
that there are some people kind

4a6c284a-f36f-43ea-9725-dc0d124cd8f7-1
00:52:56.199 --> 00:53:00.214
of chasing each other. There's a
person who's dressed as like a

4a6c284a-f36f-43ea-9725-dc0d124cd8f7-2
00:53:00.214 --> 00:53:04.040
crocodile Dundee type character
and they're chasing a person

4a6c284a-f36f-43ea-9725-dc0d124cd8f7-3
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.170
dressed as a lion.

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-0
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:11.542
Along the perimeter of the page
and the the top and it's the top

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-1
00:53:11.542 --> 00:53:16.265
left and the top right we see a
fence with large trees. And from

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-2
00:53:16.265 --> 00:53:20.697
these trees and fence there's
those triangular party banners

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-3
00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:24.983
that are multi colored hanging
and there's also some paper

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-4
00:53:24.983 --> 00:53:29.415
lanterns. On the top left tree
there's a pinata and we see a

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-5
00:53:29.415 --> 00:53:34.065
child who's blindfolded hitting
that pinata while it looks like

f7afe839-89ce-46e7-a9ad-3703655ed45b-6
00:53:34.065 --> 00:53:37.190
his parent or some adult spins
him around.

eb6168f1-7cf3-493c-bc01-22a328fc4a8f-0
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:38.510
Umm.

31e8dcb2-f653-44bb-8641-75c19c64e1a5-0
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:44.277
In if you go to the right from
there, we see more people. We

31e8dcb2-f653-44bb-8641-75c19c64e1a5-1
00:53:44.277 --> 00:53:48.387
see some people dressed as
pirates, one dressed as the

31e8dcb2-f653-44bb-8641-75c19c64e1a5-2
00:53:48.387 --> 00:53:53.094
monopoly man, a person dressed
as a dog, and then we see a man

31e8dcb2-f653-44bb-8641-75c19c64e1a5-3
00:53:53.094 --> 00:53:57.204
in the center carrying a large
birthday cake with pink

31e8dcb2-f653-44bb-8641-75c19c64e1a5-4
00:53:57.204 --> 00:54:02.060
frosting, and he's approaching a
large food table. So just below

31e8dcb2-f653-44bb-8641-75c19c64e1a5-5
00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.630
the pinata there's a.

2985a287-afde-4526-ac6b-39bec6a20239-0
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.735
What looks like kind of two long
tables put together with the

2985a287-afde-4526-ac6b-39bec6a20239-1
00:54:09.735 --> 00:54:14.162
white tablecloth on top. And
there's food there, so there's

2985a287-afde-4526-ac6b-39bec6a20239-2
00:54:14.162 --> 00:54:18.737
some sandwiches, chips, cake,
cupcakes, some tall pink thing,

2985a287-afde-4526-ac6b-39bec6a20239-3
00:54:18.737 --> 00:54:22.944
salad, and then plates. And
there's a bunch of people at

2985a287-afde-4526-ac6b-39bec6a20239-4
00:54:22.944 --> 00:54:26.560
this table, including a
Princess, a chef, a pig.

4be74ebd-1bd2-4df7-807e-936893c743cf-0
00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.512
And if we move kind of down and
left from there, there's some

4be74ebd-1bd2-4df7-807e-936893c743cf-1
00:54:32.512 --> 00:54:36.540
people playing tug of war. So it
looks like we've got some

4be74ebd-1bd2-4df7-807e-936893c743cf-2
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.500
superheroes on one end with a
pirate and a witch against.

95a4c4a9-c381-42af-8e57-91bd2721de8e-0
00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:46.380
A Viking, a Native American, and
like a.

18bfc7cb-9408-4153-9425-65cd3be063af-0
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:50.567
I can't think of what the people
who rode the chariots are like a

18bfc7cb-9408-4153-9425-65cd3be063af-1
00:54:50.567 --> 00:54:50.840
Roman?

d436720c-b169-4184-95db-6be798772f5b-0
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.640
I was like the chariot riders,
they're playing tug of war and

d436720c-b169-4184-95db-6be798772f5b-1
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.832
then to the bottom left of that
there's a table presents on it

d436720c-b169-4184-95db-6be798772f5b-2
00:54:58.832 --> 00:55:01.871
again, it has the same white
tablecloth that's the the food

d436720c-b169-4184-95db-6be798772f5b-3
00:55:01.871 --> 00:55:05.113
table has. And there's a stack
of presents and different sizes.

d436720c-b169-4184-95db-6be798772f5b-4
00:55:05.113 --> 00:55:06.380
There's one that's round.

7d80a0d6-1838-45ff-8ec4-5ff018d08cec-0
00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:10.739
And we see from below that
there's a gate and there are

7d80a0d6-1838-45ff-8ec4-5ff018d08cec-1
00:55:10.739 --> 00:55:14.933
people entering the party with
more presence. And if we move to

7d80a0d6-1838-45ff-8ec4-5ff018d08cec-2
00:55:14.933 --> 00:55:19.259
the right from there, there's an
inflatable pool that is pink and

7d80a0d6-1838-45ff-8ec4-5ff018d08cec-3
00:55:19.259 --> 00:55:19.980
yellow and.

688819e6-c348-4e8b-8b64-f59ae3aa6848-0
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.039
We see someone using the hose
from that pool and squirting

688819e6-c348-4e8b-8b64-f59ae3aa6848-1
00:55:24.039 --> 00:55:26.814
themselves in the face, and that
someone who's dressed as a

688819e6-c348-4e8b-8b64-f59ae3aa6848-2
00:55:26.814 --> 00:55:27.370
firefighter.

ee0e0600-cada-404c-a867-f412645a4a48-0
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.240
There are.

f1de00db-4b44-4da5-93ca-149b1189ded7-0
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:33.540
Like five or six people in the
pool. One of them is a mermaid

f1de00db-4b44-4da5-93ca-149b1189ded7-1
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:37.304
and a child in some orange swim
trunks is dumping water on their

f1de00db-4b44-4da5-93ca-149b1189ded7-2
00:55:37.304 --> 00:55:40.778
head while another child is
squirting someone with a squirt

f1de00db-4b44-4da5-93ca-149b1189ded7-3
00:55:40.778 --> 00:55:41.009
gun.

106164ad-326a-466d-a1be-5fea6c432857-0
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.450
And then we just see from the
right of that just some people.

5711b675-1ad2-442e-87e4-8bc5173c23c8-0
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:52.267
just kind of chasing each other
and then there is a little bit

5711b675-1ad2-442e-87e4-8bc5173c23c8-1
00:55:52.267 --> 00:55:56.754
of a quelm in the bottom right,
there's a child who's dressed as

5711b675-1ad2-442e-87e4-8bc5173c23c8-2
00:55:56.754 --> 00:56:00.825
a lamb, and it looks like we
have a shepherd and little Bo

5711b675-1ad2-442e-87e4-8bc5173c23c8-3
00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:05.104
peep who are arguing over who
owns this lamb because they are

5711b675-1ad2-442e-87e4-8bc5173c23c8-4
00:56:05.104 --> 00:56:05.449
both.

8a2de4cf-cef4-4d75-b6dd-97f7ebb98ce4-0
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:07.360
People.

50b36e67-6eaa-49b7-993c-ef3e290cb571-0
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:12.335
Um, but basically that's the
page. It's a little chaotic.

50b36e67-6eaa-49b7-993c-ef3e290cb571-1
00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:13.800
There's all sorts of.

ac6918be-cde5-47ed-82a5-b545dce77778-0
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:20.633
Costumes and looks like a fun
party. #END_birthday_party_fun

ac6918be-cde5-47ed-82a5-b545dce77778-1
00:56:20.633 --> 00:56:21.330
OK, good.

d4ce3132-526f-4a8a-b558-c8ff529592ab-0
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:24.640
OK.

6e10255a-127b-48d8-bf52-5e011ac99855-0
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:34.324
#START_campsite OK, so here
we've got another page. This

6e10255a-127b-48d8-bf52-5e011ac99855-1
00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:41.560
overall page is set up kind of
like a campground. It looks like

6e10255a-127b-48d8-bf52-5e011ac99855-2
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.030
it's divided.

945f52f5-3bae-4475-aaba-2daab23aa477-0
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.378
By a river kind of diagonally
down the center, going from left

945f52f5-3bae-4475-aaba-2daab23aa477-1
00:56:49.378 --> 00:56:52.410
to right and the upper left hand
corner.

12b3adf7-bdc7-4cb4-adae-3ed14e7736fb-0
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.320
There is a postcard type.

f7984ec8-7076-47ef-9d7d-e8900b65da90-0
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:04.892
Instruction that is on the page
and then the stamp is of Waldo's

f7984ec8-7076-47ef-9d7d-e8900b65da90-1
00:57:04.892 --> 00:57:05.370
face.

718d976c-3398-49b0-a927-6612758ce017-0
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.746
So at the very top of the page,
we just kind of see some rolling

718d976c-3398-49b0-a927-6612758ce017-1
00:57:10.746 --> 00:57:14.494
fields like what you'd see when
driving on the highway through

718d976c-3398-49b0-a927-6612758ce017-2
00:57:14.494 --> 00:57:14.970
Indiana.

4a541505-9e4a-4d1c-8bc5-4c0f4761d279-0
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.420
That's all they have there.

7df4d76d-7fc1-4476-90aa-2cb802d80969-0
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:26.140
There's a little road and
there's some people running on

7df4d76d-7fc1-4476-90aa-2cb802d80969-1
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.836
it and riding bicycles and
there's one of those old school

7df4d76d-7fc1-4476-90aa-2cb802d80969-2
00:57:29.836 --> 00:57:33.657
bicycles with a large front
wheel and a small back wheel and

7df4d76d-7fc1-4476-90aa-2cb802d80969-3
00:57:33.657 --> 00:57:37.604
it looks like that might be what
Waldo is riding. I'm not 100%

7df4d76d-7fc1-4476-90aa-2cb802d80969-4
00:57:37.604 --> 00:57:41.613
sure, but it kind of looks like
him. I could be wrong. And then

7df4d76d-7fc1-4476-90aa-2cb802d80969-5
00:57:41.613 --> 00:57:44.620
we get a a set area for RV
campers. So there's.

2c6d8e72-1f3f-43db-a83e-9bbe20e3ed81-0
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.990
9 campers.

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-0
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:51.937
Of different sizes and
varieties. So some of them are

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-1
00:57:51.937 --> 00:57:55.431
more of like the teardrop style.
Some of them are like pop-ups,

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-2
00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:59.034
some of them are just, you know,
your typical square. One of them

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-3
00:57:59.034 --> 00:58:02.473
has an awning, one of them looks
like it might have had a fire

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-4
00:58:02.473 --> 00:58:05.639
inside of it. There's smoke
billowing out of it and there

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-5
00:58:05.639 --> 00:58:09.132
are two people hanging from the
sides. That or it's this man on

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-6
00:58:09.132 --> 00:58:12.626
a grill outside and the smoke of
his grill is getting inside of

08a8c24b-0af6-47d2-9aed-47b020ad86f0-7
00:58:12.626 --> 00:58:14.809
the RV, but it's a little hard
to tell.

54ed5505-23c1-46fe-843e-b62dd2697e87-0
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:16.070
Umm.

66cf60ba-ee81-48c8-b9ab-b93602707c92-0
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.577
And then we just kind of see
people mingling around in the RV

66cf60ba-ee81-48c8-b9ab-b93602707c92-1
00:58:20.577 --> 00:58:20.850
area.

dfab8882-7344-4a6b-8bf3-36a12caa69e2-0
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.310
Talking, hanging out, having
fun. There are a few dogs.

6cbd3150-1736-4d75-b47c-128c3ff50626-0
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:30.199
People running around and then
again there's like a bike path

6cbd3150-1736-4d75-b47c-128c3ff50626-1
00:58:30.199 --> 00:58:33.615
that kind of zigzags around the
RV area and also along that

6cbd3150-1736-4d75-b47c-128c3ff50626-2
00:58:33.615 --> 00:58:37.201
river that runs left to right
diagonally through the page. And

6cbd3150-1736-4d75-b47c-128c3ff50626-3
00:58:37.201 --> 00:58:40.617
there are more people walking
around there. There is like a

6cbd3150-1736-4d75-b47c-128c3ff50626-4
00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:43.862
troop of some Boy Scouts in
yellow uniforms on the right

6cbd3150-1736-4d75-b47c-128c3ff50626-5
00:58:43.862 --> 00:58:44.830
side of the page.

6654131d-dbb4-4832-9b73-a622e5b8b9fe-0
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.770
There are people fishing in this
river.

bcf258b6-154f-4d7a-9807-db096645a2a4-0
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:54.662
A couple of mermaids in the
river, a couple hunks on a ship

bcf258b6-154f-4d7a-9807-db096645a2a4-1
00:58:54.662 --> 00:58:55.490
or a boat.

94216df7-1533-4b3c-a569-6040eb359c8c-0
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:59.888
And then people just kind of
dangling their toes in. There's

94216df7-1533-4b3c-a569-6040eb359c8c-1
00:58:59.888 --> 00:59:03.624
a small bridge that goes across
the river. It's like an arched

94216df7-1533-4b3c-a569-6040eb359c8c-2
00:59:03.624 --> 00:59:04.040
bridge.

5ddf376f-740a-4c30-9e98-f13685842020-0
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.000
And there's this small kind of.

8ae7d618-25e0-4973-b397-a44dea5932f2-0
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:12.305
boat with a stick that people
are on. Ducks are in the river

8ae7d618-25e0-4973-b397-a44dea5932f2-1
00:59:12.305 --> 00:59:15.260
and then as we get kind of below
the river.

8b3e1244-9a76-4ad1-8298-08ca9060f45a-0
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:18.060
There's a tent camping area.

097a0abe-8556-49f7-91a3-c7bf419af7e2-0
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:20.690
So we see.

3bb02e14-4f8b-4652-ad20-d55b8cdde292-0
00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:25.211
Several different tents of
different, you know, varieties.

3bb02e14-4f8b-4652-ad20-d55b8cdde292-1
00:59:25.211 --> 00:59:28.399
The classic, you know,
triangular tent. There's a

3bb02e14-4f8b-4652-ad20-d55b8cdde292-2
00:59:28.399 --> 00:59:32.224
couple square tents. There's a
tent with some hippies in it

3bb02e14-4f8b-4652-ad20-d55b8cdde292-3
00:59:32.224 --> 00:59:36.240
that looks like a lot of fun.
It's got, you know, flower power

3bb02e14-4f8b-4652-ad20-d55b8cdde292-4
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.257
style. They're outside playing
guitar. I want to spend time at

3bb02e14-4f8b-4652-ad20-d55b8cdde292-5
00:59:40.257 --> 00:59:41.660
that tent. There is a.

c7ef65a7-d72d-43cd-95ff-aed6734d3eec-0
00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:47.372
A Native American style tent.
There's also a person who is

c7ef65a7-d72d-43cd-95ff-aed6734d3eec-1
00:59:47.372 --> 00:59:51.879
inflating like a life raft.
There's a tent that's collapsed

c7ef65a7-d72d-43cd-95ff-aed6734d3eec-2
00:59:51.879 --> 00:59:55.410
and there's just people kind of
hanging about.

6afebc42-65dd-4417-98ca-7c8ea18ab535-0
00:59:56.790 --> 01:00:00.763
In and around the tents there's
people getting dressed. To the

6afebc42-65dd-4417-98ca-7c8ea18ab535-1
01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:03.980
right of the tent camping area
there is a walkway.

8a4201ed-a3fe-497e-abae-f45a6c330ebc-0
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.360
With some hikers on it.

de99d46d-814d-4bd3-8a2c-ea315822419a-0
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.973
And then to the left of that,
there's another walkway with

de99d46d-814d-4bd3-8a2c-ea315822419a-1
01:00:10.973 --> 01:00:15.088
more hikers on it. And then to
the left of that there's like a

de99d46d-814d-4bd3-8a2c-ea315822419a-2
01:00:15.088 --> 01:00:16.460
green space that has.

22ccfbf4-9bbb-4f26-ae88-bde3c70ceeb1-0
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.250
Like random bulls.

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-0
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.615
And it, I don't know why those
are there, but there are symbols

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-1
01:00:23.615 --> 01:00:27.173
and there are a bunch of people
like army crawling around this

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-2
01:00:27.173 --> 01:00:30.788
bull area. They're all kind of
like face down on their stomachs

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-3
01:00:30.788 --> 01:00:34.177
crawling around. So I don't know
what's going on there, but

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-4
01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:37.566
that's what's happening. And
then on the very far left side

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-5
01:00:37.566 --> 01:00:41.068
of the page, there's, you can
see kind of the right half of a

fc29da09-e8b8-4f20-9257-9da43c5b884c-6
01:00:41.068 --> 01:00:41.689
small pink.

717e104e-ddc4-4819-b4c7-3c47540ac9a2-0
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:46.584
Brick house, and that's kind of
everything that's going on in

717e104e-ddc4-4819-b4c7-3c47540ac9a2-1
01:00:46.584 --> 01:00:49.120
this page. #END_campsite That
was great.

97ef171d-6cdb-457b-9b44-721e7b41b638-0
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.460
Moving on, what are we gonna get
another scene? Alright.

8fadbf33-96fe-4b22-8d3d-6d9bdf852134-0
01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:03.575
#START_make_a_splash So this
overall scene is of a water park

8fadbf33-96fe-4b22-8d3d-6d9bdf852134-1
01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:08.047
and it's called making a splash
and there's a big purple post it

8fadbf33-96fe-4b22-8d3d-6d9bdf852134-2
01:01:08.047 --> 01:01:12.520
shaped blurb in the upper right
hand corner that specifies that.

59ae4e8f-b72e-42ef-a67f-eb23fbda7e56-0
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.368
There are kind of three or four
main components to this. So in

59ae4e8f-b72e-42ef-a67f-eb23fbda7e56-1
01:01:18.368 --> 01:01:22.501
the upper left hand corner
there's like twisty and turny,

59ae4e8f-b72e-42ef-a67f-eb23fbda7e56-2
01:01:22.501 --> 01:01:27.203
turny, turny body, water slides.
In the lower left corner there's

59ae4e8f-b72e-42ef-a67f-eb23fbda7e56-3
01:01:27.203 --> 01:01:28.130
a lazy river.

8699d0b2-ca0c-42ee-a130-dab8c12e55a2-0
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:33.240
And kind of the center to bottom
right, it looks like it's like a

8699d0b2-ca0c-42ee-a130-dab8c12e55a2-1
01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.372
wading pool or a wave pool. And
then on the upper right there's

8699d0b2-ca0c-42ee-a130-dab8c12e55a2-2
01:01:37.372 --> 01:01:41.375
a rainbow slide and then like a
pirate ship, water slide play

8699d0b2-ca0c-42ee-a130-dab8c12e55a2-3
01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:45.442
area. So in the upper left, like
I said, there's the the curvy

8699d0b2-ca0c-42ee-a130-dab8c12e55a2-4
01:01:45.442 --> 01:01:49.445
body slides. There's three of
them, a red one, yellow one and

8699d0b2-ca0c-42ee-a130-dab8c12e55a2-5
01:01:49.445 --> 01:01:50.220
a green one.

2e457c71-aa0e-4abd-8abc-62402ee8667e-0
01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:54.229
And there are a bunch of people
kind of in line, crowding that

2e457c71-aa0e-4abd-8abc-62402ee8667e-1
01:01:54.229 --> 01:01:57.142
area, going down, then face
first with their knees bent,

2e457c71-aa0e-4abd-8abc-62402ee8667e-2
01:01:57.142 --> 01:02:00.157
going down feet first so all
them kind of splashing out in

2e457c71-aa0e-4abd-8abc-62402ee8667e-3
01:02:00.157 --> 01:02:00.720
the middle.

5a5aafda-842d-428c-a7e2-ddc35d631f9e-0
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.565
Bottom left is that lazy river.
There's a lot of people in

5a5aafda-842d-428c-a7e2-ddc35d631f9e-1
01:02:06.565 --> 01:02:10.384
yellow rafts. Some of them are
the double rafts, so they're

5a5aafda-842d-428c-a7e2-ddc35d631f9e-2
01:02:10.384 --> 01:02:13.948
shaped like eights, and then
some of them are in single

5a5aafda-842d-428c-a7e2-ddc35d631f9e-3
01:02:13.948 --> 01:02:17.895
rafts, so they're shaped like
Donuts and they're just kind of

5a5aafda-842d-428c-a7e2-ddc35d631f9e-4
01:02:17.895 --> 01:02:22.096
floating around on these drafts.
And the Lazy River actually kind

5a5aafda-842d-428c-a7e2-ddc35d631f9e-5
01:02:22.096 --> 01:02:23.560
of goes underneath the.

6e6ca820-682b-4f93-a14f-fdbe4f705868-0
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.506
Body slide area and up towards
the top of the page and it kind

6e6ca820-682b-4f93-a14f-fdbe4f705868-1
01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:31.980
of continues on up there. Right
below the Lazy River area. There

6e6ca820-682b-4f93-a14f-fdbe4f705868-2
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.347
is like a grass area where there
are some people laying out on

6e6ca820-682b-4f93-a14f-fdbe4f705868-3
01:02:35.347 --> 01:02:38.767
beach towels and then there's a
small bridge that goes over the

6e6ca820-682b-4f93-a14f-fdbe4f705868-4
01:02:38.767 --> 01:02:41.600
lazy river to kind of get
towards the center of the.

8bd48544-0215-4086-84b2-328b2273b752-0
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.790
Page where the that wading pool
is.

ec70881b-1474-43fd-8dad-72885c540067-0
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.995
So in the wading pool there are
kind of some fun like jungle gym

ec70881b-1474-43fd-8dad-72885c540067-1
01:02:49.995 --> 01:02:53.969
type items. So there's like a
like a floating snake that you

ec70881b-1474-43fd-8dad-72885c540067-2
01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:57.357
can crawl on that's green.
There's some little like

ec70881b-1474-43fd-8dad-72885c540067-3
01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:01.657
floating log pieces that you can
run across and then there's like

ec70881b-1474-43fd-8dad-72885c540067-4
01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:02.570
some floating.

d9c23119-6ad8-4d32-9f1e-c9061d4daa14-0
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.840
Mushroom tops.

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-0
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:09.576
And and then as we go kind of
towards the top of the page,

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-1
01:03:09.576 --> 01:03:13.283
there's that pirate ship that
kids are playing on. There's

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-2
01:03:13.283 --> 01:03:17.241
like a little sea serpent next
to it that is red with blue and

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-3
01:03:17.241 --> 01:03:21.262
yellow stripes down the front,
and then some orange, yellow and

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-4
01:03:21.262 --> 01:03:24.905
green spots on its back. And
it's spurting water from its

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-5
01:03:24.905 --> 01:03:28.675
mouth. And there's a lifeguard
underneath it holding one of

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-6
01:03:28.675 --> 01:03:32.444
those, like, red lifeguard
noodle things. I don't know what

16820b76-bc93-4800-ba63-5d39ce2fb25d-7
01:03:32.444 --> 01:03:36.340
those are called, lifesavers.
And then there are some people.

cfb838f8-3cc9-498c-862d-a8b3d2faa50e-0
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.101
going out. So from the side of
the Pirate ship. There's like a

cfb838f8-3cc9-498c-862d-a8b3d2faa50e-1
01:03:40.101 --> 01:03:43.606
yellow wide slide that's short,
so it's for younger kids it

cfb838f8-3cc9-498c-862d-a8b3d2faa50e-2
01:03:43.606 --> 01:03:47.054
looks like, but basically
there's a couple kids going down

cfb838f8-3cc9-498c-862d-a8b3d2faa50e-3
01:03:47.054 --> 01:03:50.442
the slide landing in the pool
area and then we get to the

cfb838f8-3cc9-498c-862d-a8b3d2faa50e-4
01:03:50.442 --> 01:03:52.780
right which is where those it's
like a.

d11daf5e-8013-4d66-b7fe-d52873f1e846-0
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.007
If you've ever been to like a
State Fair, they have those big

d11daf5e-8013-4d66-b7fe-d52873f1e846-1
01:03:57.007 --> 01:04:00.126
slides that you ride down on
burlap sacks, but this one is

d11daf5e-8013-4d66-b7fe-d52873f1e846-2
01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:03.509
smaller, but there's like 5 or 6
lanes and kind of bumps a lot.

d11daf5e-8013-4d66-b7fe-d52873f1e846-3
01:04:03.509 --> 01:04:06.892
And then there's kids going down
and you can go down and one of

d11daf5e-8013-4d66-b7fe-d52873f1e846-4
01:04:06.892 --> 01:04:10.328
the rainbow colors and it lands
in the main area and that's kind

d11daf5e-8013-4d66-b7fe-d52873f1e846-5
01:04:10.328 --> 01:04:12.020
of this page. #END_make_a_splash

00b99801-ef79-432d-b172-67c86b0ed888-0
01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:18.583
Alright, good. There's some
construction noises, so that's

00b99801-ef79-432d-b172-67c86b0ed888-1
01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:18.800
OK.

707b4ffd-347d-428b-ac04-49c871ad8042-0
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:23.300
My cat is finally sleeping so.

f6dbb9d0-ee8e-4ac5-b8bf-1c1ddcd96177-0
01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.164
Alright, so the next looks
familiar. It's another part of

f6dbb9d0-ee8e-4ac5-b8bf-1c1ddcd96177-1
01:04:30.164 --> 01:04:33.731
this story. So yeah, just
whenever you're ready. All

f6dbb9d0-ee8e-4ac5-b8bf-1c1ddcd96177-2
01:04:33.731 --> 01:04:37.636
right, let's see if I can
remember where I was going with

f6dbb9d0-ee8e-4ac5-b8bf-1c1ddcd96177-3
01:04:37.636 --> 01:04:40.800
this or I'm just going to make
up a new story.

10084f12-3f8b-4343-a99e-d21b4ec0546d-0
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:48.497
All right, we're making up a new
story. So. So this story starts

10084f12-3f8b-4343-a99e-d21b4ec0546d-1
01:04:48.497 --> 01:04:48.920
with.

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-0
01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:54.369
Kind of. It almost is like a
dream like state. So we are

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-1
01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:57.908
seeing some clouds and the
clouds are getting bigger and

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-2
01:04:57.908 --> 01:05:01.509
clearer and then the clouds
starts to take the shape of a

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-3
01:05:01.509 --> 01:05:05.110
face. This face is kind of
round. It's got two beady eyes

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-4
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:08.960
on the far sides of the face and
the big black smile with the

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-5
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.934
tongue. And then as it kind of
comes into focus, it it does, it

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-6
01:05:12.934 --> 01:05:16.659
looks like a lizard of sorts
with a large curly tail at the

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-7
01:05:16.659 --> 01:05:20.261
back. And then we kind of get
into focus of what's really

6de887f7-3e58-4075-8704-21c254ce9cda-8
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:20.819
going on.

4ea18a6c-6bed-4187-9d0b-f0f37d185809-0
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.845
So there's a man in a bed, and
he's got his covers kind of

4ea18a6c-6bed-4187-9d0b-f0f37d185809-1
01:05:23.845 --> 01:05:26.850
pulled up towards him, and
there's this creature on his lap

4ea18a6c-6bed-4187-9d0b-f0f37d185809-2
01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:29.655
looking at him, and this
creature kind of turned around

4ea18a6c-6bed-4187-9d0b-f0f37d185809-3
01:05:29.655 --> 01:05:32.560
and flutters away, and the man
puts his hand on his head.

bfa80ffd-05f2-41b1-adc0-53e9aa833bee-0
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:36.515
And he he kind of follows where
the creature went, and he sees

bfa80ffd-05f2-41b1-adc0-53e9aa833bee-1
01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:38.820
that the creature is looking out
the window.

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-0
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.212
So the man decides, you know, I
think I should get up and get

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-1
01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.946
ready. I'm not really sure
what's going on.

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-2
01:05:51.946 --> 01:05:55.674
#START_arrival_4 So he hops in
the shower and he cleans his

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-3
01:05:55.674 --> 01:05:59.402
body and then he shaves his face
while this little creature

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-4
01:05:59.402 --> 01:06:03.255
watches and the setting is in,
you know, looks like it's like

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-5
01:06:03.255 --> 01:06:06.610
the 1940s or 50s. So he's
putting on, he's got like a

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-6
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:10.525
white button down shirt and then
he's putting on a black vest.

7a85165d-97ff-42c9-a228-a630eb098c25-7
01:06:10.525 --> 01:06:14.439
He's tying some like nicer shoes
and then he's counting money.

c11a7c29-b488-407c-977f-91b065753a49-0
01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.004
This hand grabbing like a what
are these hats called? It's

c11a7c29-b488-407c-977f-91b065753a49-1
01:06:19.004 --> 01:06:23.565
going to say like a gangster
hat. Like what? Like Al Capone

c11a7c29-b488-407c-977f-91b065753a49-2
01:06:23.565 --> 01:06:23.869
war?

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-0
01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:28.973
A fedora. It's not really a
fedora, but he's grabbing one of

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-1
01:06:28.973 --> 01:06:33.024
those style hats and then he's
looking at a map. And so he and

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-2
01:06:33.024 --> 01:06:36.562
this creature are kind of
standing in the street. He's

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-3
01:06:36.562 --> 01:06:40.742
gazing at this map, and then he
starts to walk and this creature

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-4
01:06:40.742 --> 01:06:44.858
follows him. And then we kind of
see this city. There's a large

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-5
01:06:44.858 --> 01:06:48.845
freeway type structure in the
middle, and there appears to be

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-6
01:06:48.845 --> 01:06:52.640
some smog or smoke coming from
stacks of things. There's a

5a98014c-a194-4d18-9b44-229ba79b0206-7
01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.020
large building with lots of
windows.

98db9157-5bd3-4f0f-a4ff-3a7d01f94b14-0
01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:55.880
Umm.

5d44e540-5f14-457b-8148-890fc60210d4-0
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.772
And so he continues to look at
the map, he's trying to find out

5d44e540-5f14-457b-8148-890fc60210d4-1
01:07:00.772 --> 01:07:04.444
where he's going and then he
approaches this area that's got

5d44e540-5f14-457b-8148-890fc60210d4-2
01:07:04.444 --> 01:07:06.130
like cone shaped structures.

fbc7ec1c-b042-4ef9-8bfc-6209b37fd190-0
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:11.746
They look like they're made out
of metal, almost like the tip of

fbc7ec1c-b042-4ef9-8bfc-6209b37fd190-1
01:07:11.746 --> 01:07:14.992
a rocket, and they're all of
different sizes, just kind of

fbc7ec1c-b042-4ef9-8bfc-6209b37fd190-2
01:07:14.992 --> 01:07:18.459
along this walkway with people
standing around them and in the

fbc7ec1c-b042-4ef9-8bfc-6209b37fd190-3
01:07:18.459 --> 01:07:20.220
the background there is a large.

9a10322c-0fda-4efb-8b52-ff46278f392a-0
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.901
Cement looking bridge with
different sized archways and

9a10322c-0fda-4efb-8b52-ff46278f392a-1
01:07:24.901 --> 01:07:28.480
there's this flying ship coming
out from underneath.

22f6a76b-a1ee-41c5-b0a6-132b301b4d24-0
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.350
One of the large openings.

351f463e-1d3f-4c6a-b24c-0563e538d3be-0
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:39.542
So the little creature that we
kind of originally saw in the

351f463e-1d3f-4c6a-b24c-0563e538d3be-1
01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:43.818
beginning is with another small
creature and this one looks like

351f463e-1d3f-4c6a-b24c-0563e538d3be-2
01:07:43.818 --> 01:07:48.028
an owl type thing. And this man
is standing next to a woman who

351f463e-1d3f-4c6a-b24c-0563e538d3be-3
01:07:48.028 --> 01:07:52.107
we presume this creature belongs
to and she too is looking at

351f463e-1d3f-4c6a-b24c-0563e538d3be-4
01:07:52.107 --> 01:07:56.120
something and so he begins to
talk to her and she helps him.

d9b69f13-9a3f-4afd-aadf-c1fca600afd7-0
01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:00.381
Kind of find where he's going on
this map and she's kind of

d9b69f13-9a3f-4afd-aadf-c1fca600afd7-1
01:08:00.381 --> 01:08:01.760
pointing things and then she.

db179100-5f18-44e0-9f70-7bcee9bbff26-0
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.960
Directs him towards this device.

88796dfc-3a25-45b1-a8f8-66dcfd8944cc-0
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.719
And this device looks like an
old school telephone that has

88796dfc-3a25-45b1-a8f8-66dcfd8944cc-1
01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:13.769
like a Rotary dial, and it's got
one of it looks like kind of

88796dfc-3a25-45b1-a8f8-66dcfd8944cc-2
01:08:13.769 --> 01:08:17.624
like a horn. And so she, she
dialed into it and pulled the

88796dfc-3a25-45b1-a8f8-66dcfd8944cc-3
01:08:17.624 --> 01:08:21.935
lever and something comes out of
the horn shape and she's holding

88796dfc-3a25-45b1-a8f8-66dcfd8944cc-4
01:08:21.935 --> 01:08:24.810
it in her hand and she hands it
to the man.

203d57ec-6c73-4bd3-ba21-38fd3f9607e6-0
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:30.065
Um, she gives it to him, he's
holding it. And then she pulls

203d57ec-6c73-4bd3-ba21-38fd3f9607e6-1
01:08:30.065 --> 01:08:33.953
out what looks like a pocket
watch on a chain and is

203d57ec-6c73-4bd3-ba21-38fd3f9607e6-2
01:08:33.953 --> 01:08:38.575
explained to him maybe the time
a certain thing leaves. And so

203d57ec-6c73-4bd3-ba21-38fd3f9607e6-3
01:08:38.575 --> 01:08:43.198
we presume then that this man is
going to be riding something.

203d57ec-6c73-4bd3-ba21-38fd3f9607e6-4
01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:47.600
And then we start to see these
large, again floating ships.

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-0
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:54.010
They're pretty pointy at the
front. They have one stack with

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-1
01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:58.219
smoke coming out, and the ship
is kind of pulling up into the

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-2
01:08:58.219 --> 01:09:02.564
Bay. And we see the man with his
little creature. He approaches

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-3
01:09:02.564 --> 01:09:06.841
the ship and we see kind of the
ticket taker who uses the hole

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-4
01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:11.118
puncher to punch his ticket and
directs him on board. And this

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-5
01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:14.851
ticket taker is wearing
sunglasses. He's got kind of a

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-6
01:09:14.851 --> 01:09:18.721
uniform on that's almost
military or like sailor, and he

5242b16b-94c3-41f7-9977-5a27eebf4e6f-7
01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:19.400
has a hat.

95c58fe7-af8a-4dbc-807f-2502e70cbfeb-0
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.367
So the man and his creature get
on this ship of sorts, and

95c58fe7-af8a-4dbc-807f-2502e70cbfeb-1
01:09:26.367 --> 01:09:28.330
they're sitting on a wooden
bench.

f5c7cb91-4315-44b3-81e6-3c7681a90bcd-0
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:31.551
And the woman is on board with
them, and so they're sitting

f5c7cb91-4315-44b3-81e6-3c7681a90bcd-1
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.220
next to each other and they're
chatting.

c61145d6-2a75-4899-bc6c-72d4e0524116-0
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.074
And it looks like the man is
beginning to explain the

c61145d6-2a75-4899-bc6c-72d4e0524116-1
01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:41.637
situation to him or to her. He
looks a little concerned. And

c61145d6-2a75-4899-bc6c-72d4e0524116-2
01:09:41.637 --> 01:09:45.375
he, he goes into his pocket of
his his coat, and he reaches and

c61145d6-2a75-4899-bc6c-72d4e0524116-3
01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:48.938
he pulls out a slip of paper.
And we can see on this slip of

c61145d6-2a75-4899-bc6c-72d4e0524116-4
01:09:48.938 --> 01:09:52.560
paper that there's a picture of
somebody on it and the woman.

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-0
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.791
Um kind of makes the same
gesture and reaches into her bag

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-1
01:09:57.791 --> 01:10:01.819
and pulls out a similar looking
paper with a person on it. And

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-2
01:10:01.819 --> 01:10:05.335
so they both appear to be
looking for someone and they

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-3
01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:09.235
both appear to be children. The
woman is looking for a young

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-4
01:10:09.235 --> 01:10:13.326
child with a short haircut, and
we can't quite get the image of

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-5
01:10:13.326 --> 01:10:17.226
the man's missing person, but
they're on like official forms

f22cc94e-9e52-493d-abe3-5e4bb586db7d-6
01:10:17.226 --> 01:10:19.399
that have like stamps and
things.

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-0
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.219
And then we get into what looks
like maybe a flashback for the

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-1
01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:28.150
woman. So the the color of the
page changes a little bit and

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-2
01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:32.338
it's a slightly different color.
So the most of the story is set

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-3
01:10:32.338 --> 01:10:36.398
in sepia tone, but this is more
in like a black and white. And

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-4
01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:40.328
so we see this child reading a
book and then all of a sudden

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-5
01:10:40.328 --> 01:10:44.130
some large hands come and grab
them, shove the book into a

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-6
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:48.125
locked drawer and they hand the
child the shovel and then the

6294cc2b-cfba-46e1-bd22-20998b355a99-7
01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:49.930
child is working, shoveling.

5ae1e422-d213-41bb-9dfb-18c97b7d7e9c-0
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.592
Maybe coal or some sort of
substance into a large metal

5ae1e422-d213-41bb-9dfb-18c97b7d7e9c-1
01:10:53.592 --> 01:10:57.709
barrel and there's flames coming
out of it, and then the child is

5ae1e422-d213-41bb-9dfb-18c97b7d7e9c-2
01:10:57.709 --> 01:11:01.389
climbing to the top of this
thing and sweeping the chimney

5ae1e422-d213-41bb-9dfb-18c97b7d7e9c-3
01:11:01.389 --> 01:11:05.443
of it. And so it looks like very
dangerous work for such a young

5ae1e422-d213-41bb-9dfb-18c97b7d7e9c-4
01:11:05.443 --> 01:11:05.879
person.

d361a4ad-c4fe-44d5-b41a-2d2b3cc16e46-0
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.854
And then we kind of see that
this child is not the only child

d361a4ad-c4fe-44d5-b41a-2d2b3cc16e46-1
01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:19.421
doing this. It's like a almost
like a a camp filled with these

d361a4ad-c4fe-44d5-b41a-2d2b3cc16e46-2
01:11:19.421 --> 01:11:23.915
these smoke stacks and so it's
like a a balloon at the bottom

d361a4ad-c4fe-44d5-b41a-2d2b3cc16e46-3
01:11:23.915 --> 01:11:27.250
and then a large stack coming
out of the top.

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-0
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:32.605
With a small opening where the
flame and where you throw the

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-1
01:11:32.605 --> 01:11:36.761
coal and they're divided into
almost like cubicles. And each

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-2
01:11:36.761 --> 01:11:41.258
one has a a person with a shovel
fueling it. And it goes down for

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-3
01:11:41.258 --> 01:11:45.482
rows and rows and rows. And we
see this young girl at the top

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-4
01:11:45.482 --> 01:11:49.570
of her sweeping her chimney and
she's looking out over this

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-5
01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:53.590
large operation. And this large
operation is set in a even

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-6
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:57.541
larger operation. So it's like
in the crevice between two

494821fe-2b55-49e2-9e6b-b081498968df-7
01:11:57.541 --> 01:11:58.700
bigger buildings.

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-0
01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.916
So then we see this child kind
of in what I would assume is

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-1
01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:06.236
their living quarters and
they're kind of or maybe they're

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-2
01:12:06.236 --> 01:12:09.500
still in their, their cubicle,
but they're sitting on the

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-3
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.707
ground on head is in their
hands. And then they start to

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-4
01:12:12.707 --> 01:12:16.083
kind of think is there a way
that I can get out of here. So

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-5
01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:19.234
you can see the examining the
situation they're looking

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-6
01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.442
around, they're using their
shovel to pry at the door to

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-7
01:12:22.442 --> 01:12:25.706
look through and then we see
that they they do escape and

5100c533-adac-4150-ae52-4046c202a38e-8
01:12:25.706 --> 01:12:29.419
they get back to where they were
at the beginning where the book.

5c80e249-0293-45d7-aaa0-1c2b7ab50bf2-0
01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:33.695
was locked into the cupboard and
we see that the the child gets

5c80e249-0293-45d7-aaa0-1c2b7ab50bf2-1
01:12:33.695 --> 01:12:37.860
into that that drawer and steals
her book and kind of runs off.

b234417f-7dc0-4be8-a32e-9ebeecd2e1bd-0
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:43.835
The child then finds a railway
and climbs into one of the carts

b234417f-7dc0-4be8-a32e-9ebeecd2e1bd-1
01:12:43.835 --> 01:12:48.104
and is sitting in an empty cart
with their book and the train

b234417f-7dc0-4be8-a32e-9ebeecd2e1bd-2
01:12:48.104 --> 01:12:51.683
starts to kind of go away
towards what looks like a

b234417f-7dc0-4be8-a32e-9ebeecd2e1bd-3
01:12:51.683 --> 01:12:52.510
countryside.

0194675a-ed21-46ba-8d4c-d12f71f8ca31-0
01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.424
So now we're back in the sepia
tone. So we assume that we're in

0194675a-ed21-46ba-8d4c-d12f71f8ca31-1
01:13:00.424 --> 01:13:04.945
the present time and we see that
large ship that that man and the

0194675a-ed21-46ba-8d4c-d12f71f8ca31-2
01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:08.986
woman were on and they're
floating over a city. There is a

0194675a-ed21-46ba-8d4c-d12f71f8ca31-3
01:13:08.986 --> 01:13:11.590
different language on the
billboards.

7c4b9dd4-d32a-4097-97b1-e2ce83d43083-0
01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:16.808
Than English. And we see a
billboard of a woman holding

7c4b9dd4-d32a-4097-97b1-e2ce83d43083-1
01:13:16.808 --> 01:13:19.947
what looks like tea or coffee,
and they're just kind of

7c4b9dd4-d32a-4097-97b1-e2ce83d43083-2
01:13:19.947 --> 01:13:23.422
pointing and looking out over
everything. And then a man in a

7c4b9dd4-d32a-4097-97b1-e2ce83d43083-3
01:13:23.422 --> 01:13:26.729
uniform starts shouting at them
through one of those like.

82dfcc80-3886-4464-95eb-df8d92c5d962-0
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.840
Cheer.

c45e8cf2-5b74-4e1c-8c25-4498afe10eef-0
01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:32.370
Cones that like.

ee6b4005-91ca-4834-a71e-f251aa4da8d4-0
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:37.974
Amplifies your voice and it
looks like they're getting close

ee6b4005-91ca-4834-a71e-f251aa4da8d4-1
01:13:37.974 --> 01:13:42.172
to landing wherever they were
going. And so the ship docks and

ee6b4005-91ca-4834-a71e-f251aa4da8d4-2
01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:45.970
the man and the woman are
parting ways and they get off.

ee6b4005-91ca-4834-a71e-f251aa4da8d4-3
01:13:45.970 --> 01:13:50.035
And so the man just kind of
stops to think, and then he's at

ee6b4005-91ca-4834-a71e-f251aa4da8d4-4
01:13:50.035 --> 01:13:53.299
the top of the stairwell
overlooking this large.

23d4e1b8-ede3-4608-89bc-ac089da32579-0
01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.700
I don't even know how to
describe it. It's like a.

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-0
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:03.806
It's like a town, but it's
almost like a complex of like

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-1
01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:08.114
like a park, but it's made out
of concrete. And there's a large

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-2
01:14:08.114 --> 01:14:12.220
statue of a a creature in the
center holding a basket filled

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-3
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.258
with items. And then there it
looks like there's some other

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-4
01:14:16.258 --> 01:14:20.431
items at the bottom that look
like milk and eggs in the bowl.

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-5
01:14:20.431 --> 01:14:24.201
So he's at the top of the
stairs. There's like a little

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-6
01:14:24.201 --> 01:14:28.643
city on the right hand side, and
then there's this kind of cement

4c155c19-4be8-4abc-b5f5-df59b60bd426-7
01:14:28.643 --> 01:14:28.980
park.

4ac2ecab-651e-49eb-a844-efc45fb9fd5c-0
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.930
On the left that he's looking
over.

5d459480-5955-4469-ae70-78fa7f6ef6d5-0
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:37.220
So he starts to walk.

9a739c40-c735-462d-8762-7733b396757a-0
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.230
He walks.

f2ea21ca-4fcb-4b01-b646-587407fa15f6-0
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:43.574
Through the the city, he's kind
of seeing everything that's

f2ea21ca-4fcb-4b01-b646-587407fa15f6-1
01:14:43.574 --> 01:14:47.098
going on. There are different
salesman. One man is selling

f2ea21ca-4fcb-4b01-b646-587407fa15f6-2
01:14:47.098 --> 01:14:51.041
what looks like kind of octopus.
Looks like there's a person kind

f2ea21ca-4fcb-4b01-b646-587407fa15f6-3
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:53.730
of selling some trinkets,
selling some fish.

55196b2b-d4d9-4acd-afff-364af0615c4e-0
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:58.896
Um, there's just people kind of
going all around and this man is

55196b2b-d4d9-4acd-afff-364af0615c4e-1
01:14:58.896 --> 01:15:00.560
looking at a booklet of.

3ad5c109-f24c-4a0c-bed1-6c0f78c2ba87-0
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:05.419
I don't know if it like
describes rations for things, or

3ad5c109-f24c-4a0c-bed1-6c0f78c2ba87-1
01:15:05.419 --> 01:15:09.165
if it's maybe he doesn't speak
the language and so he's trying

3ad5c109-f24c-4a0c-bed1-6c0f78c2ba87-2
01:15:09.165 --> 01:15:12.436
to look up translations to
better communicate with the

3ad5c109-f24c-4a0c-bed1-6c0f78c2ba87-3
01:15:12.436 --> 01:15:16.063
people he's interacting with,
but then his little creature's

3ad5c109-f24c-4a0c-bed1-6c0f78c2ba87-4
01:15:16.063 --> 01:15:19.691
kind of looking at this wall
where there's a bunch of things

3ad5c109-f24c-4a0c-bed1-6c0f78c2ba87-5
01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:20.940
on and he's pointing.

613d31db-e0bb-4464-8b0b-8a615cbde0ca-0
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:25.772
And so the man opens this
drawer. There's some little like

613d31db-e0bb-4464-8b0b-8a615cbde0ca-1
01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:29.786
maraca shaped items in there and
he continues to look at his

613d31db-e0bb-4464-8b0b-8a615cbde0ca-2
01:15:29.786 --> 01:15:34.129
book. And then he goes back into
that drawer and picks one up and

613d31db-e0bb-4464-8b0b-8a615cbde0ca-3
01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.840
he takes it over to a boy.

334cd813-2743-434c-9d19-a952f45a7488-0
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:41.150
And and a boy and a man kind of
stand there holding it.

5bb62644-ec7d-487a-a905-fb057f3f551b-0
01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:45.437
And then they go to give it back
to the man, and the man's like

5bb62644-ec7d-487a-a905-fb057f3f551b-1
01:15:45.437 --> 01:15:48.913
no. And then he opens his book
and points to a loaf of bread,

5bb62644-ec7d-487a-a905-fb057f3f551b-2
01:15:48.913 --> 01:15:52.501
and it looks like he's trying to
communicate with these people,

5bb62644-ec7d-487a-a905-fb057f3f551b-3
01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:54.800
and he shows them the money in
his hand.

8806395b-e8f3-4a4b-a6c7-4c7f0e50a991-0
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:59.825
The man that he's interacting
with points to a wall and opens

8806395b-e8f3-4a4b-a6c7-4c7f0e50a991-1
01:15:59.825 --> 01:16:02.771
up a little compartment and
pulls out some other kind of

8806395b-e8f3-4a4b-a6c7-4c7f0e50a991-2
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:03.030
item.

6d2bdb83-c9a6-4173-bf3e-8847cb47782f-0
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.290
And then

960655c7-f088-4b10-8fa4-9c3141b35fd8-0
01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.300
The original man kind of puts it
up to his face.

0a7bb637-f0c6-42e4-a874-8544da087174-0
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.131
Not really sure what's going on.
And then the little boy kind of

0a7bb637-f0c6-42e4-a874-8544da087174-1
01:16:14.131 --> 01:16:17.742
comes up with a Wicker basket
and the item that the man had

0a7bb637-f0c6-42e4-a874-8544da087174-2
01:16:17.742 --> 01:16:21.112
taken from the wall is now in
the Wicker basket and our

0a7bb637-f0c6-42e4-a874-8544da087174-3
01:16:21.112 --> 01:16:24.542
original man in the coat is
holding the basket with item

0a7bb637-f0c6-42e4-a874-8544da087174-4
01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:26.949
while he talks to this other
gentleman.

b80f4dd7-d96d-42f4-b63e-9b462ffca15b-0
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.869
So the salesman, the gentleman
is holding up additional items.

b80f4dd7-d96d-42f4-b63e-9b462ffca15b-1
01:16:35.869 --> 01:16:39.391
It looks like the tail of
something. Little boy shows

b80f4dd7-d96d-42f4-b63e-9b462ffca15b-2
01:16:39.391 --> 01:16:40.370
something else.

5c2e5d6a-0e8f-4153-85a7-5f4c778729a3-0
01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:46.022
Looks like some sort of creature
or device. The man puts

5c2e5d6a-0e8f-4153-85a7-5f4c778729a3-1
01:16:46.022 --> 01:16:49.603
something in his mouth a little
boy comes with like a giant

5c2e5d6a-0e8f-4153-85a7-5f4c778729a3-2
01:16:49.603 --> 01:16:50.200
artichoke.

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-0
01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.878
The man is holding like some
sort of, you know, mollusk or

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-1
01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:57.940
clan, with little tentacles
coming out of it. The man is

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-2
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.055
then holding like a snake
creature, and they're just kind

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-3
01:17:01.055 --> 01:17:03.955
of showing him all these
different items. And the man

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-4
01:17:03.955 --> 01:17:07.070
then takes a bite of the first
item he was given, and the

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-5
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:10.561
little boy feeds his little pet
with something else. And then we

6bbc5e54-9f8e-4688-8002-8282ac0230bd-6
01:17:10.561 --> 01:17:13.730
see that this man has a basket
full of all sorts of goods.

b98b9fec-ceeb-4571-965d-2971f3305534-0
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.318
And we can assume then, that
these are food items in this

b98b9fec-ceeb-4571-965d-2971f3305534-1
01:17:18.318 --> 01:17:22.058
culture. They're just different
than what the man was looking

b98b9fec-ceeb-4571-965d-2971f3305534-2
01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:25.858
for on his his roster because
he's, I'm guessing he's not from

b98b9fec-ceeb-4571-965d-2971f3305534-3
01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:29.236
here. So the little boy
whispered something into what I

b98b9fec-ceeb-4571-965d-2971f3305534-4
01:17:29.236 --> 01:17:33.096
assume is his father's ear. And
then the man goes up to the the

b98b9fec-ceeb-4571-965d-2971f3305534-5
01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:35.570
original man and put his arm
around him.

7be8a3de-ecd6-417f-85c4-18454e9bee88-0
01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.931
Um, holding the basket of goods
and then the little boy is

7be8a3de-ecd6-417f-85c4-18454e9bee88-1
01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:43.359
holding the basket of goods and
they point to these boats. And

7be8a3de-ecd6-417f-85c4-18454e9bee88-2
01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:46.190
so they start kind of leading to
this. It's like a.

c282f19f-d957-46be-a638-bf9e7561d602-0
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.067
a pier, but there isn't any
water and the boats are all

c282f19f-d957-46be-a638-bf9e7561d602-1
01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:54.483
tethered, but they're they're
laying on sand and so they're

c282f19f-d957-46be-a638-bf9e7561d602-2
01:17:54.483 --> 01:17:57.899
kind of walking in between all
these these wooden row boats

c282f19f-d957-46be-a638-bf9e7561d602-3
01:17:57.899 --> 01:18:00.289
with baskets of items, the three
of them.

b908da14-7f65-458b-b18e-ad114ea512dd-0
01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:10.705
So they approached one of the
boats the little boy is leading.

b908da14-7f65-458b-b18e-ad114ea512dd-1
01:18:10.705 --> 01:18:13.320
There's a pot like a Terra cotta
pot.

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-0
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.625
At the end of the boat filled
with something, and the boy kind

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-1
01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:21.271
of tells the man to get closer.
And as he gets closer it looks

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-2
01:18:21.271 --> 01:18:24.860
like a tentacle of something is
poking out. And the man backs

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-3
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.448
away and drops his things. And
the other man comforts her and

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-4
01:18:28.448 --> 01:18:31.804
he's like, comforts him. And
he's like, no, come on, come

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-5
01:18:31.804 --> 01:18:35.335
look at it. And so they get
closer, and the little boys then

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-6
01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:38.981
holding this creature, and it
looks like the mixture of like a

40c26505-41c1-40bd-b362-41b3e481809a-7
01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:40.369
fox and an owl and like.

1b2d319b-4b8a-4e27-a438-335bbcc7acce-0
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.750
Some sort of lizard combined.

2a08af3e-6f13-4de6-bc0e-075a955fe93b-0
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.342
The tail is very lizard like and
so he's holding it and they're

2a08af3e-6f13-4de6-bc0e-075a955fe93b-1
01:18:49.342 --> 01:18:53.042
just kind of interacting looking
at it and then the animal's set

2a08af3e-6f13-4de6-bc0e-075a955fe93b-2
01:18:53.042 --> 01:18:56.628
down and the fox like animal is
interacting with the man's pet

2a08af3e-6f13-4de6-bc0e-075a955fe93b-3
01:18:56.628 --> 01:19:00.214
that is lizard like and white
and they're just kind of playing

2a08af3e-6f13-4de6-bc0e-075a955fe93b-4
01:19:00.214 --> 01:19:03.630
together and the man goes to
pick up items that he dropped.

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-0
01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:08.195
And he's talking to the other
man and then it looks like he's

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-1
01:19:08.195 --> 01:19:12.290
trying to communicate with this
man. So he gets out his book and

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-2
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:16.133
he starts to draw and he draws 3
houses and a large tentacle

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-3
01:19:16.133 --> 01:19:20.164
looking item in the sky and he
shows it to the man. And the man

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-4
01:19:20.164 --> 01:19:24.070
looks a little perplexed and he
kind of puts his hands on his

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-5
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:28.039
chest. And then he looks up to
the sky and as we get closer to

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-6
01:19:28.039 --> 01:19:31.378
his eye, his eye has the
reflection of flames in it.

4d7c8cc2-4db7-46fe-963a-cd837c4fdf5e-7
01:19:31.378 --> 01:19:32.259
#END_arrival_4

ca2a2412-ba81-4c6b-b5db-04d4f18349ef-0
01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.632
So let me see. What a
frightening image. So we see

ca2a2412-ba81-4c6b-b5db-04d4f18349ef-1
01:19:43.632 --> 01:19:49.810
some what looked like giant men
dressed similarly to how?

8078a965-b4ea-45cb-99de-dc1213113484-0
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.422
You would if you were entering
Chernobyl back in 1986. Like

8078a965-b4ea-45cb-99de-dc1213113484-1
01:19:56.422 --> 01:20:00.715
they're wearing large suits with
helmets and have a small opening

8078a965-b4ea-45cb-99de-dc1213113484-2
01:20:00.715 --> 01:20:04.357
on the helmet to see, and
there's a bright light coming

8078a965-b4ea-45cb-99de-dc1213113484-3
01:20:04.357 --> 01:20:07.610
from their helmets and these
people are huge, so.

a10f2a3f-972f-4a8e-857c-779200b2a3d0-0
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.550
If the people we were talking
about were like.

77e73347-2e1b-49e0-bc9b-4a9c2b3089e4-0
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:19.297
They're like the equivalent to
like ants to these giant men and

77e73347-2e1b-49e0-bc9b-4a9c2b3089e4-1
01:20:19.297 --> 01:20:23.036
then they have these horn shaped
suction things and they're

77e73347-2e1b-49e0-bc9b-4a9c2b3089e4-2
01:20:23.036 --> 01:20:27.086
sucking up all these people with
these devices. We just see like

77e73347-2e1b-49e0-bc9b-4a9c2b3089e4-3
01:20:27.086 --> 01:20:30.887
flames in the background and it
looks like they just kind of

77e73347-2e1b-49e0-bc9b-4a9c2b3089e4-4
01:20:30.887 --> 01:20:34.937
sucking up everyone in the world
into these these kind of vacuum

77e73347-2e1b-49e0-bc9b-4a9c2b3089e4-5
01:20:34.937 --> 01:20:37.429
like devices and it's quite
terrifying.

502d70be-fdb9-46ab-9550-bc7819e2e235-0
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:45.530
So now I think we must be in a
flashback of this man.

157f5828-b6bb-4b64-a22d-c8f0c4d4a270-0
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.080
And he's in what looks like.

a3df8dc4-d68d-471e-996d-8ac29887d57f-0
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:56.100
Sir large rectangular prism.

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-0
01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:01.565
Hard to tell if they're made out
of maybe stone items that are

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-1
01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:05.666
kind of coming together, getting
out like crystals. And there he

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-2
01:21:05.666 --> 01:21:09.452
and some person, I assume it's
his wife, are standing there

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-3
01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:12.923
together. And then they're
running and they're holding

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-4
01:21:12.923 --> 01:21:16.961
hands and they go to hide in a
manhole or a sewer drain. So the

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-5
01:21:16.961 --> 01:21:20.621
man helps the woman in, they
close it and then they, they

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-6
01:21:20.621 --> 01:21:24.533
hear the large speed. You can
see the large feet of these men

792420cf-3afa-49a0-bdd6-6c27991f6713-7
01:21:24.533 --> 01:21:28.130
who are sucking people up kind
of step over their sewer.

23be8e12-2a66-4634-924d-95fd7fd56b34-0
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.330
Cover, and so they.

00d1ccfe-d2d1-4ed6-9406-215bd9db2f27-0
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.842
They peek their heads out after
it's gone, and they start to

00d1ccfe-d2d1-4ed6-9406-215bd9db2f27-1
01:21:33.842 --> 01:21:35.650
come out and they they look
around.

c2687adb-40f3-4b73-a147-bcb97281b8c8-0
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.380
Barely.

0ed7ee26-7c9b-4226-93a1-24305b1399ff-0
01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:47.107
So then they start to kind of
wander around. They're still in

0ed7ee26-7c9b-4226-93a1-24305b1399ff-1
01:21:47.107 --> 01:21:51.404
this weird or large geometric
shapes everywhere, and they're

0ed7ee26-7c9b-4226-93a1-24305b1399ff-2
01:21:51.404 --> 01:21:55.350
very big. The man has to help
his wife up over a ledge.

b5af5106-e533-4756-93a5-caf887592fb0-0
01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.662
She's only got like a foot
clearance above it and they're

b5af5106-e533-4756-93a5-caf887592fb0-1
01:22:00.662 --> 01:22:04.791
standing at a corner's edge and
they can see the large boots of

b5af5106-e533-4756-93a5-caf887592fb0-2
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:05.630
one of those.

d82b7de1-b546-4ccb-950a-5c4b22b2c299-0
01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:10.990
Evil suction then. So they start
to kind of hug each other. They

d82b7de1-b546-4ccb-950a-5c4b22b2c299-1
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:14.030
think it's maybe the end. And
then all of a sudden.

7710a1de-636e-47b2-b1b8-b5cf94ce5b94-0
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:17.650
They realize that it's not a
large.

418ce1a6-6eda-439e-aa64-ea5033b8815a-0
01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.191
A large section they they come
across a man with the Lantern,

418ce1a6-6eda-439e-aa64-ea5033b8815a-1
01:22:23.191 --> 01:22:26.898
and the man with the Lantern
offers them a ladder and shows

418ce1a6-6eda-439e-aa64-ea5033b8815a-2
01:22:26.898 --> 01:22:28.320
them a map and kind of.

cb0fb58e-caea-4d0c-a080-ab9b0f2e0cc6-0
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.918
Makes them somewhere. As the
large suction man is walking in

cb0fb58e-caea-4d0c-a080-ab9b0f2e0cc6-1
01:22:32.918 --> 01:22:35.986
the opposite direction, they're
they're going somewhere with

cb0fb58e-caea-4d0c-a080-ab9b0f2e0cc6-2
01:22:35.986 --> 01:22:36.590
this ladder.

b6625cf0-ddf9-494c-beed-6c6861237795-0
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.830
So use this ladder to climb up.

6d3b857a-15ed-4ac6-bc4d-cf59f38d289d-0
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:48.851
And then they hop down over what
looks like rubble from the

6d3b857a-15ed-4ac6-bc4d-cf59f38d289d-1
01:22:48.851 --> 01:22:53.887
aftermath of the suctioning and
destruction, and they they come

6d3b857a-15ed-4ac6-bc4d-cf59f38d289d-2
01:22:53.887 --> 01:22:58.924
across some water, it looks like
an ocean or a sea, and they're

6d3b857a-15ed-4ac6-bc4d-cf59f38d289d-3
01:22:58.924 --> 01:23:02.780
pointing to a boat. And so they
the the two men.

46c2011b-df2c-4b90-9a56-1c7df2baf436-0
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.858
What happened? No, it's just the
man and the woman. The man and

46c2011b-df2c-4b90-9a56-1c7df2baf436-1
01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:11.232
the woman get on this boat and
they start to paddle off away

46c2011b-df2c-4b90-9a56-1c7df2baf436-2
01:23:11.232 --> 01:23:14.549
from the city where all that
destruction was happening. And

46c2011b-df2c-4b90-9a56-1c7df2baf436-3
01:23:14.549 --> 01:23:17.922
so they're like kind of in the
safety of this rowboat on the

46c2011b-df2c-4b90-9a56-1c7df2baf436-4
01:23:17.922 --> 01:23:21.130
waterway and you just see the
the city in the background.

f3efb517-2fa9-4e74-959f-2cd125fedd5a-0
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:31.071
So it looks like they came to a
new city, and the city is like

f3efb517-2fa9-4e74-959f-2cd125fedd5a-1
01:23:31.071 --> 01:23:32.930
owl themed, so there's.

bbda8dd6-1e64-40e3-9787-96a905eb0961-0
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.830
There's large owl shaped
structures everywhere.

862c16b5-f96c-4c15-a7ce-02faef96facc-0
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:43.607
It looks very much like a
coastal town, almost like what

862c16b5-f96c-4c15-a7ce-02faef96facc-1
01:23:43.607 --> 01:23:47.139
you would see in Greece, like in
Santorini. You know, the houses

862c16b5-f96c-4c15-a7ce-02faef96facc-2
01:23:47.139 --> 01:23:50.563
that are kind of stacked on one
another going up the cliffside

862c16b5-f96c-4c15-a7ce-02faef96facc-3
01:23:50.563 --> 01:23:53.877
and there's a ramp that the
boats can go up and then there's

862c16b5-f96c-4c15-a7ce-02faef96facc-4
01:23:53.877 --> 01:23:57.029
boats lined along it. And so
they they get to this place,

862c16b5-f96c-4c15-a7ce-02faef96facc-5
01:23:57.029 --> 01:24:00.290
they they dock and we are in the
present time now, so it's.

eea381ec-6b0c-4f52-ba3c-19b13c13749a-0
01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.410
The two men and the boy.

14e3e76d-33e5-4c91-928a-79917330d658-0
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.180
And so they are.

e09e5b8f-9ab7-47be-b381-bf9b02501119-0
01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:12.349
Going up the stairs and they
come to this woman and we assume

e09e5b8f-9ab7-47be-b381-bf9b02501119-1
01:24:12.349 --> 01:24:16.819
now that this woman is the man's
wife who is in the the flashback

e09e5b8f-9ab7-47be-b381-bf9b02501119-2
01:24:16.819 --> 01:24:21.221
that we had just experienced. So
it's a very merry welcome. They

e09e5b8f-9ab7-47be-b381-bf9b02501119-3
01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:24.540
pour drinks, they are preparing
a meal together.

5c4e1112-5bd9-474f-8895-7295cb19e436-0
01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.370
And it looks like it it's kind
of going to be a good night.

79be1af7-e791-47bd-ae76-66e641e088c9-0
01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:34.200
So they're all sitting around a
table.

9440e324-c3fe-4714-862d-b0a3b62ff6cc-0
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:38.933
Having a nice meal that the two
little creatures are on the

9440e324-c3fe-4714-862d-b0a3b62ff6cc-1
01:24:38.933 --> 01:24:42.299
ground and the little boy is
feeding them table scraps and

9440e324-c3fe-4714-862d-b0a3b62ff6cc-2
01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:45.723
looks like the man is telling a
story and the woman and the

9440e324-c3fe-4714-862d-b0a3b62ff6cc-3
01:24:45.723 --> 01:24:49.374
original man that we met in the
beginning are laughing and then

9440e324-c3fe-4714-862d-b0a3b62ff6cc-4
01:24:49.374 --> 01:24:50.629
he's starting to play.

c42639bf-752a-4500-997c-54d946a55bc5-0
01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:55.256
Well, looks like a concertina or
an accordion with large horns

c42639bf-752a-4500-997c-54d946a55bc5-1
01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:58.913
