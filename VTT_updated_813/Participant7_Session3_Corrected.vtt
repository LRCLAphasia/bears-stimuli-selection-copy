2d310691-f3fe-4348-8470-27c62ab4040a-0
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.977
OK, we are continuing on
describing your the pictures

2d310691-f3fe-4348-8470-27c62ab4040a-1
00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:12.470
that I show you.

9866e883-ac85-45ce-9afb-5c6d765ab3f7-0
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.810
This is a complex scene. Please
describe it in as much detail as

9866e883-ac85-45ce-9afb-5c6d765ab3f7-1
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.210
you can. What is? Describe what
is happening and what you see,

9866e883-ac85-45ce-9afb-5c6d765ab3f7-2
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.471
and I'll keep track of the time.
Take between three and five

9866e883-ac85-45ce-9afb-5c6d765ab3f7-3
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:28.030
minutes.

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-0
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.492
#START_picture_this OK, so this
picture shows almost like a

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-1
00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:38.257
collage of picture frames filled
with pictures kind of spread out

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-2
00:00:38.257 --> 00:00:42.806
so they aren't completely on top
of one another, but there are

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-3
00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:47.499
kind of overlapping corners and
edges and things. And so we have

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-4
00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.264
some large square pictures, some
rectangular pictures, some small

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-5
00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:56.740
square pictures, and some small
rectangular pictures, and the

18df5a39-9a98-46db-8dff-e3752c91f9f3-6
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.989
pictures have a couple different
background.

ffdaa382-2b72-4681-8a62-b71bda1a478e-0
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.372
Colors. So some of the pictures
have kind of a salmon pink

ffdaa382-2b72-4681-8a62-b71bda1a478e-1
00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:09.196
background, others have a bright
yellow, others kind of have like

ffdaa382-2b72-4681-8a62-b71bda1a478e-2
00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:13.363
a sandy beige, and there's a
bluish background, and then

ffdaa382-2b72-4681-8a62-b71bda1a478e-3
00:01:13.363 --> 00:01:18.041
there's a paler blue background,
and so on these picture frames

ffdaa382-2b72-4681-8a62-b71bda1a478e-4
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:22.865
there are all sorts of pictures,
and most of them appear to be of

ffdaa382-2b72-4681-8a62-b71bda1a478e-5
00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:23.450
Cavemen.

53cc8eb2-1d9d-4b92-a991-829bfb6ca9ae-0
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.620
Is what it looks like or.

46d50a63-736b-4463-9fc6-85b5da570d2d-0
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.785
I don't know. There's a lot of
Cavemen scenes where there's

46d50a63-736b-4463-9fc6-85b5da570d2d-1
00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:34.907
other things too. So we've got
in the upper left hand side, we

46d50a63-736b-4463-9fc6-85b5da570d2d-2
00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:38.964
have a dragon with sunglasses,
and then there is a man laying

46d50a63-736b-4463-9fc6-85b5da570d2d-3
00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:43.217
on his stomach with another man
standing on his back. So some of

46d50a63-736b-4463-9fc6-85b5da570d2d-4
00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:47.273
the larger photos on the scene
include a man in a wheelbarrow

46d50a63-736b-4463-9fc6-85b5da570d2d-5
00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:50.480
with another man pushing him in
the wheelbarrow.

bad41509-5742-4b1b-9369-63e02577cf90-0
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.903
And there's a picture with two
people dressed as like jesters

bad41509-5742-4b1b-9369-63e02577cf90-1
00:01:56.903 --> 00:02:02.089
looking at each other. There's a
picture of a man who is stuck

bad41509-5742-4b1b-9369-63e02577cf90-2
00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:07.275
inside a large snowball. Other
large photos include like a man

bad41509-5742-4b1b-9369-63e02577cf90-3
00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:12.379
getting hit in the head with
either a coffee or a beer mug by

bad41509-5742-4b1b-9369-63e02577cf90-4
00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.119
a knight.

46f65967-598e-4715-95d9-47b47ee038c2-0
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.687
A large picture of a man
standing up against a palm tree,

46f65967-598e-4715-95d9-47b47ee038c2-1
00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:21.324
and it's kind of bent over in
half and the palm tree has stuff

46f65967-598e-4715-95d9-47b47ee038c2-2
00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:24.787
shaking out of it and it looks
like it might be hitting the

46f65967-598e-4715-95d9-47b47ee038c2-3
00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:26.000
other man underneath.

4e5e31ea-8ad7-4032-967f-9d18f7f2ff89-0
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.441
And some of the other larger
pictures include like a fountain

4e5e31ea-8ad7-4032-967f-9d18f7f2ff89-1
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:35.744
with a man in a snorkel and
flippers kind of being blasted

4e5e31ea-8ad7-4032-967f-9d18f7f2ff89-2
00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:37.130
up by the fountain.

8b6474d1-4675-4be0-ae37-0eeb29c9d03c-0
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.646
There is a picture of some other
kind of dragon towards the

8b6474d1-4675-4be0-ae37-0eeb29c9d03c-1
00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:49.090
bottom, with a man looking at
him in the eye.

2f7b7a59-ff5b-4f42-842a-ef4d77a1ce5d-0
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.652
Um, there's a large image of a
man being carried over the

2f7b7a59-ff5b-4f42-842a-ef4d77a1ce5d-1
00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.870
shoulder of a woman.

851d2051-2df2-406f-816e-d794166fb8af-0
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.080
And.

50d5a992-4eff-448f-81a4-d026caff6646-0
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.856
Just a bunch of other random
pictures like that. So I I can't

50d5a992-4eff-448f-81a4-d026caff6646-1
00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:07.679
actually tell if there is a
theme. There might not be a

50d5a992-4eff-448f-81a4-d026caff6646-2
00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.704
theme to this. At first it
looked like caveman, but I don't

50d5a992-4eff-448f-81a4-d026caff6646-3
00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.830
think there is a theme to the
pictures. They're all just kind

50d5a992-4eff-448f-81a4-d026caff6646-4
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.452
of different and I think that's
pretty much it, OK?

50d5a992-4eff-448f-81a4-d026caff6646-5
00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:17.309
#END_picture_this

c8ba2b8f-a962-47a2-8cad-1635faec9468-0
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.730
All right, then we can move on
to the next one.

42c5d70a-2f56-41f1-8d4f-8cad7a233ccd-0
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.930
This is another complex scene
again.

02616028-a1da-455d-8626-589e08052981-0
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.999
It's the same, yeah, sounds
good.

02616028-a1da-455d-8626-589e08052981-1
00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.630
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
So this looks like the set of

02616028-a1da-455d-8626-589e08052981-2
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.810
either a movie or a play. So we
have kind of.

0f122a66-aa99-4551-82aa-241ca17a7e7f-0
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.586
Three different areas of set. So
one of the sets in the upper

0f122a66-aa99-4551-82aa-241ca17a7e7f-1
00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:49.573
left hand area of the scene is
outer space. So it's got a blue

0f122a66-aa99-4551-82aa-241ca17a7e7f-2
00:03:49.573 --> 00:03:51.710
backdrop with pink and red.

931691bc-41a1-4352-971f-919cb4de04cf-0
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.050
UFO shaped.

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-0
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.259
Spaceships, and then a large
orange and yellow rocket, which

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-1
00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.736
is upside down so it looks like
it landed the wrong way on

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-2
00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:08.441
whatever this alien land is.
Umm. And so there are a bunch of

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-3
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:12.994
almost look like scuba divers,
but they're spacemen kind of

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-4
00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:17.548
flying around fighting green
aliens with the big red eye in

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-5
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:22.177
the middle. Umm. And so the the
actors are hanging down from

445b0ab0-9978-46ff-9f5d-33d898e15415-6
00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:25.819
ropes, but it looks like they're
flying around.

6c740313-ff83-40c5-918b-1e5673edbb92-0
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.668
And they're standing on a ground
that is a paler blue, and it's

6c740313-ff83-40c5-918b-1e5673edbb92-1
00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:34.104
kind of rocky and has some
hills, so it looks like they're

6c740313-ff83-40c5-918b-1e5673edbb92-2
00:04:34.104 --> 00:04:35.270
on a distant planet.

bea146b2-8cf4-4df9-b3e1-0bed19a07768-0
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.170
Another scene that is set is on
the left hand side and it's.

82d3c1f2-325a-4fd0-8063-c3a875b9a2f0-0
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.111
Um, mostly orange or brownish.
And it is kind of like a volcano

82d3c1f2-325a-4fd0-8063-c3a875b9a2f0-1
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:52.492
scene. So there's a large
volcano structure. And then

82d3c1f2-325a-4fd0-8063-c3a875b9a2f0-2
00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:57.035
there are dinosaurs and Cavemen,
and so there are seven

82d3c1f2-325a-4fd0-8063-c3a875b9a2f0-3
00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.819
dinosaurs, green, red.

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-0
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.312
Purple, light blue, a darker
green, another purplish color

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-1
00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:07.409
and another red one. And they're
all different types of dinosaurs

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-2
00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.762
and they all look kind of
friendly. They're not doing

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-3
00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:14.797
anything ferocious or anything,
but there are a bunch of Cavemen

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-4
00:05:14.797 --> 00:05:18.832
in, like what looks like woolly
mammoth for kind of outfits with

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-5
00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:22.805
no pants. It's just kind of off
uh upper part of their body and

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-6
00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:26.592
then it kind of covers their
their rear ends. But it doesn't

20e91135-1305-4390-8d31-179415e07a5b-7
00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:29.509
go down much further than that,
so very short.

780e60d4-9037-4616-9476-e6ca79b34b57-0
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.610
But they're just kind of all.

ae4ebfe2-99cc-4730-9d97-2345739233f4-0
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.400
Together on this kind of
volcanic landscape.

ddc66659-cc7a-4097-b063-d52f20f56757-0
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.260
It's hard to tell what's really
going on in this scene.

12ae6358-9a33-4ae5-815d-1fe7a54ac056-0
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.535
They might be between a break of
takes or something like that and

12ae6358-9a33-4ae5-815d-1fe7a54ac056-1
00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:48.610
then the last scene we have is
it looks like it's inside.

ef698d65-324c-44d6-8ccf-bf03a732f181-0
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.862
A building, and it looks like
it's supposed to be kind of

ef698d65-324c-44d6-8ccf-bf03a732f181-1
00:05:52.862 --> 00:05:56.870
spooky. And there are some bats,
there's a tree, and then there's

ef698d65-324c-44d6-8ccf-bf03a732f181-2
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.300
two large kind of Gothic style
windows.

d97a1a93-5963-425b-a66d-5869895fa08f-0
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.680
Umm.

aeebaa7b-4698-45aa-9fa9-0fb74d8698e8-0
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.460
And we've got a red carpet with
a mummy and a ghost and a ghoul

aeebaa7b-4698-45aa-9fa9-0fb74d8698e8-1
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.149
kind of walking towards the
camera. And there is a large ice

aeebaa7b-4698-45aa-9fa9-0fb74d8698e8-2
00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:15.839
cream cone in the center of this
scene, so I don't know what

aeebaa7b-4698-45aa-9fa9-0fb74d8698e8-3
00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.605
that's for. But then outside of
the the scene drops there are

aeebaa7b-4698-45aa-9fa9-0fb74d8698e8-4
00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:20.990
like.

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-0
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.048
Kind of break rooms or something
similar or that the crew and the

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-1
00:06:26.048 --> 00:06:30.008
like extras get to go. And so
the walls there are beige and it

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-2
00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:34.094
looks like there's like a buffet
area or a kitchen where they're

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-3
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:38.055
serving food and there's some
break tables. And so you can see

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-4
00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:41.763
different characters like
Dracula and Aliens sitting there

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-5
00:06:41.763 --> 00:06:45.849
amongst crew members and amongst
Cavemen and that's on the lower

eb7d0605-27e6-48ba-9cdd-25bfb592c113-6
00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.370
right hand side and then on the
left side there's like.

cca75f85-6ec9-4c0f-a106-87e198cd4c5e-0
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.560
Maybe they're serving like
coffee or a drink of some sort.

cca75f85-6ec9-4c0f-a106-87e198cd4c5e-1
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.578
And again, it's like a little
rest area. There's two

cca75f85-6ec9-4c0f-a106-87e198cd4c5e-2
00:06:56.578 --> 00:07:00.280
bathrooms, one of which has like
a dinosaur character going into

cca75f85-6ec9-4c0f-a106-87e198cd4c5e-3
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.583
it and then the other one has
one of the space characters

cca75f85-6ec9-4c0f-a106-87e198cd4c5e-4
00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:07.228
coming out of it. So that's the
the main idea of this page. OK,

cca75f85-6ec9-4c0f-a106-87e198cd4c5e-5
00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:09.620
great.

655ca41d-8bdc-48f0-9351-15fe586a44fe-0
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.800
OK, moving on.

d53e70b2-fa22-47bf-9504-0d7770264250-0
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.376
This is another story, so again,
describe what you see and what

d53e70b2-fa22-47bf-9504-0d7770264250-1
00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:22.130
is happening as you go through
the story.

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-0
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.495
#START_quest So this picture is
of what looks like, it's in the

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-1
00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:32.606
center of a park where there's
like a large stone bridge.

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-2
00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:36.858
There's statues on the side of
this bridge, one of an Angel

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-3
00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:41.252
type figure and then the other
of a mermaid. But we don't see

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-4
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:45.859
the mermaid's head and it looks
like it's raining outside. There

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-5
00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:50.466
is a park bench and a park light
and then underneath this bridge

e2fc5556-c945-4c85-9df6-87ce2bb3c0b4-6
00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:54.010
we see two children, a boy and a
girl and we see.

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-0
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.483
a bicycle. And the boy and the
girl are each holding a coloring

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-1
00:07:58.483 --> 00:08:03.024
like a crayon. The girl's is red
and the boy's is purple, and the

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-2
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:07.153
boy has a purple bird on his
shoulder. And we notice a bike

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-3
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:11.212
to the left of them that has
both a purple wheel and a red

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-4
00:08:11.212 --> 00:08:15.341
wheel and two seats. And then
directly left to the children

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-5
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:19.607
there is a doorway that is kind
of, it's not like a cathedral

f9da9e9d-e538-4d66-820e-71ebf053eada-6
00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.190
style. It's got like a.

78f1851f-5464-4c7e-9bdc-7e9e2b23c4f2-0
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.351
Inverted, like the tear drop
doesn't bow outwards, it bows

78f1851f-5464-4c7e-9bdc-7e9e2b23c4f2-1
00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:28.957
inwards. Like, I don't know how
to describe what that is, but

78f1851f-5464-4c7e-9bdc-7e9e2b23c4f2-2
00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:32.098
the girls looking at this
doorway, and that's kind of

78f1851f-5464-4c7e-9bdc-7e9e2b23c4f2-3
00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:33.320
where the picture is.

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-0
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.886
So all of a sudden an emperor or
king type man comes out of that

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-1
00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:45.087
doorway and he is dressed in
mostly orange, and he's holding

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-2
00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:49.564
an orange crayon. And he's got a
drawn crown on his head that is

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-3
00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:53.902
also in orange. And in his hand
he is holding a piece of paper

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-4
00:08:53.902 --> 00:08:58.241
that has six colors circles on
it and they're all connected to

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-5
00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:02.718
each other in a circle. So it's
six individual circles connected

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-6
00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:06.919
to make one big circle, and it's
the different colors of the

def76e31-2764-42fb-89a7-2ab5ea3284ca-7
00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:07.470
rainbow.

e751d0f6-c89c-41ba-be02-313d2e5a4596-0
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.636
And he's showing it to the two
children, who are kind of taken

e751d0f6-c89c-41ba-be02-313d2e5a4596-1
00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:14.737
aback. The little girl has
fallen and the boy is kind of

e751d0f6-c89c-41ba-be02-313d2e5a4596-2
00:09:14.737 --> 00:09:18.000
falling backwards, and the
emperor character is giving them

e751d0f6-c89c-41ba-be02-313d2e5a4596-3
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.210
like the shush sign. So he's got
his finger over his lips,

e751d0f6-c89c-41ba-be02-313d2e5a4596-4
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.570
telling them to be quiet.

351a61f7-c463-48f7-ba4e-b8b0f5db739c-0
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.930
And then we see him put.

415fd384-6e87-4c8e-9dbc-3a2585f7ce0a-0
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.970
Like a sash on the girl that
has.

79bce28b-186c-4cd2-81ab-b75c844f7dce-0
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.420
Little.

a3ad59d5-8a57-41fc-a3ad-03f4a98d09e6-0
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.487
Compartments to hold the
different crayons, and he gives

a3ad59d5-8a57-41fc-a3ad-03f4a98d09e6-1
00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:38.650
the piece of paper to the boy.

279481ef-b8e1-49b4-bbd0-c1d162b8e201-0
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.669
And then two guards come out of
the doorway and grab the

279481ef-b8e1-49b4-bbd0-c1d162b8e201-1
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:46.264
emperor, and the guards are
armed with like Spears, and they

279481ef-b8e1-49b4-bbd0-c1d162b8e201-2
00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:49.800
grab him by the arm, and he
flings his orange crayon and he

279481ef-b8e1-49b4-bbd0-c1d162b8e201-3
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.337
gets taken back through the
doorway. And so the little girl

279481ef-b8e1-49b4-bbd0-c1d162b8e201-4
00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:56.932
and the little boy are left with
their crowns and the orange

279481ef-b8e1-49b4-bbd0-c1d162b8e201-5
00:09:56.932 --> 00:09:58.170
crayon on the ground.

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-0
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.208
So now they're standing outside
of the door. The little girl

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-1
00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:09.590
places the orange crayon into
the sash compartment to hold on

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-2
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.027
to it, and now they're drawing
next to the door. So we see the

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-3
00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:16.355
girl drawing some sort of figure
on the left, and the boy is

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-4
00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:19.629
drawing one on the ground. And
then we see that they drew 2

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-5
00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:22.902
keys. And so with those keys
they opened up the doorway and

76132063-e799-4150-825b-9a1d8b5f409b-6
00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:25.740
they go in and the purple bird
follows behind them.

449df041-63cb-4985-8db3-2a97e7183c4a-0
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:35.450
So now they're in kind of a a
mystical land that is 

84027a95-d349-4e2d-9e90-f88d2fde17f8-0
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.130
{The mailman cheers to my dog is
going to bark.

3492cccb-2aae-4b35-93ba-bbc3ad4f8d1d-0
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:50.233
Is that like another minute?
Holly, it's fine. It comes every

3492cccb-2aae-4b35-93ba-bbc3ad4f8d1d-1
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.960
day. Yeah, OK, I'll buy it now.}

d8a442da-cc1b-402c-a082-857c70582010-0
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.444
But so we're in a land, it's
filled with castles that have

d8a442da-cc1b-402c-a082-857c70582010-1
00:10:58.444 --> 00:11:02.644
very tall tower like structures
and there's bridges everywhere

d8a442da-cc1b-402c-a082-857c70582010-2
00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:06.978
and there's big golden domes on
top of some of these towers. And

d8a442da-cc1b-402c-a082-857c70582010-3
00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:11.246
then other towers have more like
shingled roofs and we see kind

d8a442da-cc1b-402c-a082-857c70582010-4
00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:12.780
of some sort of flying.

579bd2e2-d465-48f4-9f40-45e98677a0d7-0
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.030
Umm.

319c769d-a72d-42ff-9336-2de0aa922fdc-0
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.495
Aircraft in the sky on the left
and the little girl pop out

319c769d-a72d-42ff-9336-2de0aa922fdc-1
00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:23.715
underneath a small waterfall and
they're kind of tucked behind a

319c769d-a72d-42ff-9336-2de0aa922fdc-2
00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:27.935
sharp rock and across the river
from them we see like a a paddle

319c769d-a72d-42ff-9336-2de0aa922fdc-3
00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:28.260
boat.

ebef0e7d-a5f3-4bf3-9066-6c883318d539-0
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.526
Um from behind with the Emperor
on it, and he's surrounded by

ebef0e7d-a5f3-4bf3-9066-6c883318d539-1
00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:35.833
guards, and they're going
underneath an archway while the

ebef0e7d-a5f3-4bf3-9066-6c883318d539-2
00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:39.370
little boy and the little girl
look on from behind this rock.

72db3d7b-55bd-40ea-91dc-26224fc8518e-0
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.050
So then we see.

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-0
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.093
They're continuing off into the
distance on that ship, going

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-1
00:11:50.093 --> 00:11:53.737
under. And above on the bridge,
we see additional guards and

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-2
00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:57.201
boats, and we see the little
girl looking at the piece of

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-3
00:11:57.201 --> 00:12:01.083
paper that the Emperor had given
him with the colored circles on

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-4
00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:04.906
it. And so we then get to view a
closer view of the map, and we

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-5
00:12:04.906 --> 00:12:08.251
see that inside each of the
circles there's a different

ee20e93f-1c70-4c3e-b12b-b36651894613-6
00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:08.610

2f4d40e1-bd00-4263-a8fc-240b3f5ba0bc-0
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.752
And they're connected by varying
degrees of the rainbow. And so

2f4d40e1-bd00-4263-a8fc-240b3f5ba0bc-1
00:12:13.752 --> 00:12:17.535
in the bottom right hand side is
a purple circle and there's a

2f4d40e1-bd00-4263-a8fc-240b3f5ba0bc-2
00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:21.077
palm tree, and as you move left
there's a purple line that

2f4d40e1-bd00-4263-a8fc-240b3f5ba0bc-3
00:12:21.077 --> 00:12:24.379
connects it to a red circle,
which shows a tree with a

2f4d40e1-bd00-4263-a8fc-240b3f5ba0bc-4
00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:24.860
doorway.

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-0
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.424
And that then connects with the
red and purple line to an orange

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-1
00:12:30.424 --> 00:12:34.683
circle that shows what looks
like a cityscape of this castle.

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-2
00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:38.324
And then again the colors
continue. So it's now red,

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-3
00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:42.788
orange and purple, connecting to
a yellow circle, which looks to

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-4
00:12:42.788 --> 00:12:47.116
show an underwater land. There's
fish and almost like it looks

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-5
00:12:47.116 --> 00:12:51.512
kind of like Atlantis. And then
from there, red, orange, yellow

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-6
00:12:51.512 --> 00:12:55.496
and purple line connects to a
green circle where we see a

b95f39c1-7a5e-4c09-9b09-b1ca060394be-7
00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:55.840
tall.

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-0
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.931
Structure with what looks like a
bridge connecting to it, and

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-1
00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:03.803
that connects them to a blue
circle which shows a mountain.

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-2
00:13:03.803 --> 00:13:07.933
And then again that Blue circle
connects with all colors of the

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-3
00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:11.805
rainbow back to the starting
purple circle. And this is all

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-4
00:13:11.805 --> 00:13:15.806
kind of overlaying on top of a
general map. And it looks like

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-5
00:13:15.806 --> 00:13:19.871
this is a map of wherever they
are. So I'm thinking that maybe

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-6
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:23.937
these circles are highlighting
the areas in which you can find

1dc07529-891e-4eeb-83ee-b7be66777fda-7
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:25.680
these different structures.

4b339d93-00fa-4f3e-90dc-d2c457235f5a-0
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.950
So we see additional guards and
we see a a man who looks like he

4b339d93-00fa-4f3e-90dc-d2c457235f5a-1
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.368
has some sort of royal
importance or military

4b339d93-00fa-4f3e-90dc-d2c457235f5a-2
00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:42.529
importance as he's dressed in
gold and has a large gold

4b339d93-00fa-4f3e-90dc-d2c457235f5a-3
00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:43.050
helmet.

0fab8bb4-8b20-4965-8271-9cf826dd5192-0
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.204
And they are going by on like a
gondola style boat, so there's a

0fab8bb4-8b20-4965-8271-9cf826dd5192-1
00:13:48.204 --> 00:13:51.220
man at the back pushing with a
large stick.

a88a4fae-3f4d-4783-af81-800603701b61-0
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.889
So the little boy and the little
girl are then sitting on the

a88a4fae-3f4d-4783-af81-800603701b61-1
00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:01.059
rock and they get to drawing and
it looks like they draw like

a88a4fae-3f4d-4783-af81-800603701b61-2
00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:05.094
fish or no not fish. And they
draft like flippers. There we

a88a4fae-3f4d-4783-af81-800603701b61-3
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:09.129
go, flippers and almost looks
like a scuba tank and a scuba

a88a4fae-3f4d-4783-af81-800603701b61-4
00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:13.433
helmet. And the little boy draws
what looks like the tentacles,

a88a4fae-3f4d-4783-af81-800603701b61-5
00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:17.670
like an octopus or a squid. And
then they dive into the water.

95961156-8690-4e81-9da8-86e8bed5dd0c-0
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.740
um wearing the flippers that the
girl drew in red.

370c560a-2c66-4cfa-8ee5-cfd045c239f7-0
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.802
So now the boy and the girl are
wearing their full scuba gear.

370c560a-2c66-4cfa-8ee5-cfd045c239f7-1
00:14:28.802 --> 00:14:30.870
Even the bird is wearing a
little.

132b7048-b00d-404c-b94f-c9c44e67303a-0
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.320
Air tank to

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-0
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.396
Just make sure he gets oxygen
and they're holding on to the

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-1
00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:41.083
tentacles of what we now learn
is a giant squid and we see them

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-2
00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:44.424
heading underwater and we do see
kind of an Atlantis like

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-3
00:14:44.424 --> 00:14:47.650
structure and it almost looks
like the thing called the

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-4
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.221
Parthenon. I always get them
confused, the Parthenon and then

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-5
00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:54.793
there's the other one, but it
looks like it's got big pillars

c3d3c3ec-753a-4d0b-af24-9693193873ec-6
00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:58.250
and triangular roof and it's set
in a rectangle and we see.

2424283a-b85d-48d3-a16a-dbcd0f36d9a8-0
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.236
Some shark swimming around it,
and there are some other

2424283a-b85d-48d3-a16a-dbcd0f36d9a8-1
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.889
building structures, like a tall
tower that has several windows

2424283a-b85d-48d3-a16a-dbcd0f36d9a8-2
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:10.142
and then a tall narrow tower
that has the sculpture of a

2424283a-b85d-48d3-a16a-dbcd0f36d9a8-3
00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:13.738
mermaid holding something and
then surrounding this whole kind

2424283a-b85d-48d3-a16a-dbcd0f36d9a8-4
00:15:13.738 --> 00:15:13.910
of.

7c61efea-caf9-49cf-a6b7-036128592f7f-0
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.367
Area is what looks like either a
gate or a bridge, and it's very

7c61efea-caf9-49cf-a6b7-036128592f7f-1
00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:23.203
tall and it has a bunch of
archways underneath it, so

7c61efea-caf9-49cf-a6b7-036128592f7f-2
00:15:23.203 --> 00:15:26.399
they're heading down towards
this structure.

e050ac7b-351e-43b0-85aa-aa771ff17b32-0
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.930
So the boy and the girl get to
the center of.

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-0
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.352
Like the column to building,
it's kind of deteriorating. So

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-1
00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:42.104
it doesn't have all the roof or
all of the the top of the

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-2
00:15:42.104 --> 00:15:46.180
pillars, but they're inside the
center. And we see a statue of

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-3
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.192
seahorses and on top of that
there is an open shell and there

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-4
00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:54.333
is a yellow crayon laying in the
center of this open shell. And

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-5
00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:58.085
surrounding them are just
different underwater plants and

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-6
00:15:58.085 --> 00:16:02.032
fish. And so the little girl
picks up the yellow crayon, she

04b76d3b-77e1-434c-bda7-bd9850ddd80a-7
00:16:02.032 --> 00:16:04.750
sticks it inside of her little
sash that.

bba8d2f2-dd54-4b19-8737-e9a4f4fddc48-0
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.530
has the compartments and then
they start to swim away, holding

bba8d2f2-dd54-4b19-8737-e9a4f4fddc48-1
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.290
on to the giant squid, but they
noticed the guards and the man.

76b8a86a-599d-4cbd-bbd2-0bb01010d02c-0
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.933
With the gold helmet are kind of
following after them and

76b8a86a-599d-4cbd-bbd2-0bb01010d02c-1
00:16:16.933 --> 00:16:20.150
pointing towards them as if
they're ready to chase them.

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-0
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.818
So the boy and the girl come to
the surface and they land on

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-1
00:16:28.818 --> 00:16:33.360
what looks like kind of a grassy
beach with palm trees kind of

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-2
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.902
scattered every which way and
bent over and kind of the little

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-3
00:16:37.902 --> 00:16:42.372
wild looking doesn't look like
many people live here. So they

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-4
00:16:42.372 --> 00:16:46.626
kind of go in towards this
jungle type area and they start

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-5
00:16:46.626 --> 00:16:50.952
to Draw Something again. So the
boy is drawing a large semi

a62b92fb-2227-49a1-93c0-604c994c7d66-6
00:16:50.952 --> 00:16:54.630
circular structure and then the
girl is attaching.

671b9fe3-0b85-4839-8615-9e7d39ea40a5-0
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.134
Like a square to that. So we
aren't sure exactly what they're

671b9fe3-0b85-4839-8615-9e7d39ea40a5-1
00:16:57.134 --> 00:16:58.980
drawing yet, but they're working
on something.

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-0
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.427
So it looks like what they ended
up drawing was a rhinoceros. So

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-1
00:17:06.427 --> 00:17:10.144
the rhinoceros is large and
purple and on top of that is

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-2
00:17:10.144 --> 00:17:14.121
like a carrying compartment for
them. So it's like what they

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-3
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:18.424
carry them when emperors need to
move in, but it's red and it has

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-4
00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:22.532
like a little roof and it looks
like it's made out of tapestry

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-5
00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:26.509
and so they're riding this rhino
down what looks like a dirt

7a51259c-baf2-485d-bf51-76b3da4a057f-6
00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:30.030
pathway towards what looks
almost like like an Aztec.

250fb8c9-5c23-426b-aa42-6876cb9a65a9-0
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.901
Kind of village. So there's
these pyramids that have large

250fb8c9-5c23-426b-aa42-6876cb9a65a9-1
00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:39.943
stairwells going up to them and
there are two statues that are

250fb8c9-5c23-426b-aa42-6876cb9a65a9-2
00:17:39.943 --> 00:17:44.985
in the shape of like men, but
they have bird like wings behind

250fb8c9-5c23-426b-aa42-6876cb9a65a9-3
00:17:44.985 --> 00:17:49.787
them. And we see as they're
getting closer in the distance,

250fb8c9-5c23-426b-aa42-6876cb9a65a9-4
00:17:49.787 --> 00:17:54.828
there is like a long, it almost
looks like a suspension bridge

250fb8c9-5c23-426b-aa42-6876cb9a65a9-5
00:17:54.828 --> 00:17:57.950
made out of like rope connecting
to a.

128aa0b7-0210-4a3c-a2c4-5f81e553f401-0
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.900
A pointy structure that's in the
water.

7caf8a3e-ac25-4884-9ff9-2ae9b62001e7-0
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.868
So now that they're closer, we
do see that it is a suspension

7caf8a3e-ac25-4884-9ff9-2ae9b62001e7-1
00:18:08.868 --> 00:18:12.316
bridge. It's very tattered and
it's kind of falling apart and

7caf8a3e-ac25-4884-9ff9-2ae9b62001e7-2
00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:13.929
it's got like long pieces of.

46c89573-8cb7-4467-8ea3-2db990628355-0
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.960
Rope that's frayed and drooping
off of it.

cc7d9346-9c3f-45ff-92d3-f50beb70f54d-0
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.163
So the boy and the girl are
running across this trying to

cc7d9346-9c3f-45ff-92d3-f50beb70f54d-1
00:18:22.163 --> 00:18:25.797
get to the top of this structure
which is growing or glowing like

cc7d9346-9c3f-45ff-92d3-f50beb70f54d-2
00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:27.670
the green light color at the
top.

ef5c44ec-ee06-412c-9f32-8b7f10e2c728-0
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.965
So they get to the top of this
and it looks like what was up

ef5c44ec-ee06-412c-9f32-8b7f10e2c728-1
00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:39.610
there was one of the crayons. We
don't know for sure, but the

ef5c44ec-ee06-412c-9f32-8b7f10e2c728-2
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.431
girl is holding something in her
hand and as they look down they

ef5c44ec-ee06-412c-9f32-8b7f10e2c728-3
00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:46.781
see the guards are running
across that suspension bridge

ef5c44ec-ee06-412c-9f32-8b7f10e2c728-4
00:18:46.781 --> 00:18:50.485
towards them and so they begin
to Draw Something again. And so

ef5c44ec-ee06-412c-9f32-8b7f10e2c728-5
00:18:50.485 --> 00:18:52.659
the boy is drawing four like
oblong.

056018be-9790-49ae-9ae7-3cb4a740f14b-0
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.530
Shapes and then the girl is
drawing a rectangular box.

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-0
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.187
So what they ended up drawing
was a large dragonfly. So the

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-1
00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:09.199
boy was drawing the wings of the
dragonfly, and then the girl had

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-2
00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:13.211
drawn a swing to connect it. And
so it's like a wooden swing that

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-3
00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:16.980
has two ropes that kind of go
through the wood and not at the

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-4
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.870
bottom. And they're sitting on
that and the dragonfly is flying

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-5
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.457
away and they're just making it
out of reach of the guards

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-6
00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:27.800
trying to grab them, and they
are flying off towards a

fa15f102-0469-437a-b92a-410691918a25-7
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.530
mountainous.

4b6b936f-fab0-41e7-8b14-c83f5e29b5e2-0
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.260
Area that is kind of snowy.

ebf79ac9-5139-4863-8623-7d1e71ead1d7-0
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.614
They get to this mountainous
area and they land on top of

ebf79ac9-5139-4863-8623-7d1e71ead1d7-1
00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:43.570
another temple like structure
this one has.

1ea7aa3f-991e-465e-bc37-29bbf290c669-0
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.650
Like some?

b75dd596-c679-412e-a6e7-d4240016f1ab-0
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.680
Like.

c545b83f-5f74-43ec-bcca-02636d10e945-0
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.889
It's like a man who's sitting in
a yoke like a cross legged yoga

c545b83f-5f74-43ec-bcca-02636d10e945-1
00:19:52.889 --> 00:19:56.387
pose and he's got a sash and
then on top is like a roof and

c545b83f-5f74-43ec-bcca-02636d10e945-2
00:19:56.387 --> 00:20:00.002
then on top of that it almost
looks like a teacup. The teacup

c545b83f-5f74-43ec-bcca-02636d10e945-3
00:20:00.002 --> 00:20:03.558
doesn't have a handle and then
there's a lid and then like a

c545b83f-5f74-43ec-bcca-02636d10e945-4
00:20:03.558 --> 00:20:06.590
point on top of that and so they
climb down off of.

99f4727c-749b-414e-81b0-b83691e9a8ef-0
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.983
The swing that the girl had
drawn and they grab a blue or

99f4727c-749b-414e-81b0-b83691e9a8ef-1
00:20:10.983 --> 00:20:15.028
was it? I think it's blue-green,
maybe dark green blue or dark

99f4727c-749b-414e-81b0-b83691e9a8ef-2
00:20:15.028 --> 00:20:19.266
green crayon and stick it in the
sash of the girl's carrying them

99f4727c-749b-414e-81b0-b83691e9a8ef-3
00:20:19.266 --> 00:20:23.311
on. But in the background we see
again the guards coming in on

99f4727c-749b-414e-81b0-b83691e9a8ef-4
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:26.650
these floating structures that
basically look like.

3c4a1499-e0fa-4880-8375-38076ad490c0-0
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.686
Some sort of like rowboat canoe,
but they're connected to like a

3c4a1499-e0fa-4880-8375-38076ad490c0-1
00:20:30.686 --> 00:20:33.600
large blimp like balloon that
are coming towards them, so

3c4a1499-e0fa-4880-8375-38076ad490c0-2
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.716
they're flying through the air
and so the girl is holding up.

3c4a1499-e0fa-4880-8375-38076ad490c0-3
00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:39.781
She's got all six of the crayons
now in her sash and they're

3c4a1499-e0fa-4880-8375-38076ad490c0-4
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.540
standing on top of this
structure.

352db360-0e94-4ae7-b9f4-7ba778497173-0
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.779
So all of a sudden the guards
are kind of there. We see the

352db360-0e94-4ae7-b9f4-7ba778497173-1
00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:55.059
man in gold reaching as the
purple bird flies away with the

352db360-0e94-4ae7-b9f4-7ba778497173-2
00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:59.482
sash and and they're both both
man in gold. And another guard

352db360-0e94-4ae7-b9f4-7ba778497173-3
00:20:59.482 --> 00:21:03.833
are reaching towards the bird
and it looks like he's getting

352db360-0e94-4ae7-b9f4-7ba778497173-4
00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:04.190
away.

26dab328-e117-4707-8b57-caeb91b0f8e7-0
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.920
That's kind of all that's really
going on in that page.

415e2464-ba7e-4202-9afe-b329bc0046ef-0
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.902
So as the bird is flying, a jet
of rainbow kind of shoots out

415e2464-ba7e-4202-9afe-b329bc0046ef-1
00:21:14.902 --> 00:21:19.030
from the six crayons and it goes
into the the pointy structure

415e2464-ba7e-4202-9afe-b329bc0046ef-2
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.157
that the kids are standing next
to and it kind of lights it up

415e2464-ba7e-4202-9afe-b329bc0046ef-3
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:27.220
and the rainbow kind of jets in
between the boy and the girl.

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-0
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.738
And it looks like it kind of
lets out like a burst of

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-1
00:21:31.738 --> 00:21:36.088
colorful sparks and it kind of
sends a wave. So it looks like

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-2
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:40.227
it created some sort of like
pressure or burst that knocks

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-3
00:21:40.227 --> 00:21:44.717
the the aircraft towards their
hind ends. And so the guards are

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-4
00:21:44.717 --> 00:21:48.997
kind of tumbling backwards out
of their their structures and

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-5
00:21:48.997 --> 00:21:53.207
kind of hanging on by the ropes
to stay or falling to their

03196cfe-a7ca-4627-884c-d19b651e1390-6
00:21:53.207 --> 00:21:54.469
deaths, basically.

b759bf69-a4cc-44e4-9986-660b3a1e2ebb-0
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.506
And then we kind of get a
distant view and we see the

b759bf69-a4cc-44e4-9986-660b3a1e2ebb-1
00:22:02.506 --> 00:22:04.560
rainbow is arching all the way
down.

5006b3c1-3239-4e8c-bda2-48a8be9a3c83-0
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.596
Across the city and across the
castle and it hits the boat that

5006b3c1-3239-4e8c-bda2-48a8be9a3c83-1
00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:11.020
the emperor had been on.

109376d4-8f9e-46fc-9b0b-4d9ad61b0bb8-0
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.863
And it lands there, and the
emperor is cheering. He's got

109376d4-8f9e-46fc-9b0b-4d9ad61b0bb8-1
00:22:15.863 --> 00:22:19.295
his arms in the air, he's
looking back at the structure on

109376d4-8f9e-46fc-9b0b-4d9ad61b0bb8-2
00:22:19.295 --> 00:22:22.784
top of the mountain, and the
guards are all kind of falling

109376d4-8f9e-46fc-9b0b-4d9ad61b0bb8-3
00:22:22.784 --> 00:22:26.507
off the end of the boat and into
the water. And we see the bird

109376d4-8f9e-46fc-9b0b-4d9ad61b0bb8-4
00:22:26.507 --> 00:22:29.590
is kind of flying off from where
the rainbow landed.

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-0
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.543
So then we kind of have like an
overview picture of the whole

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-1
00:22:39.543 --> 00:22:43.688
town, and it looks a lot happier
now. There's a bright rainbow in

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-2
00:22:43.688 --> 00:22:47.519
the background and the light is
almost like like sunset, and

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-3
00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:51.035
it's very like a yellowish
colors hitting the city. And

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-4
00:22:51.035 --> 00:22:54.866
there's beautiful shadows kind
of hitting things. And we see

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-5
00:22:54.866 --> 00:22:58.446
the different guards are no
longer, it doesn't seem like

a28f899b-2d21-488f-ad72-7dc66dcc69bc-6
00:22:58.446 --> 00:23:01.900
they're in control of the city
anymore, it looks like.

e816427c-2fef-4952-ba3f-132d0e820780-0
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.207
Maybe the townspeople are in
control, or a different set of

e816427c-2fef-4952-ba3f-132d0e820780-1
00:23:06.207 --> 00:23:10.562
guards who maybe aren't wanting
to steal these crayons. But we

e816427c-2fef-4952-ba3f-132d0e820780-2
00:23:10.562 --> 00:23:15.055
do see the emperor, the boy, the
girl sitting atop of the purple

e816427c-2fef-4952-ba3f-132d0e820780-3
00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:15.470
rhino.

04dc16e1-6db2-43bb-9cc6-5b3b66380960-0
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.919
The boy and the girl are inside
the little red carrying canvas,

04dc16e1-6db2-43bb-9cc6-5b3b66380960-1
00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:23.533
and then the emperor's in front
of them, and then they are on

04dc16e1-6db2-43bb-9cc6-5b3b66380960-2
00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:26.971
the paddle boat where the
emperor had been taken on and in

04dc16e1-6db2-43bb-9cc6-5b3b66380960-3
00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:30.468
the water we see the tentacles
of the squid that had helped

04dc16e1-6db2-43bb-9cc6-5b3b66380960-4
00:23:30.468 --> 00:23:30.760
them.

c2cce86d-b765-4f40-9deb-eea5907b6040-0
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.695
So the boat takes them back to
where the rock was that they

c2cce86d-b765-4f40-9deb-eea5907b6040-1
00:23:38.695 --> 00:23:42.084
originally started with a small
waterfall and kind of the

c2cce86d-b765-4f40-9deb-eea5907b6040-2
00:23:42.084 --> 00:23:45.356
gateway that leads to the
doorway that they started by.

c2cce86d-b765-4f40-9deb-eea5907b6040-3
00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:48.978
And so it looks like they land
on this track, they go through

c2cce86d-b765-4f40-9deb-eea5907b6040-4
00:23:48.978 --> 00:23:49.680
the gateway.

3415aab7-6d96-41fc-b8e2-371f643dd314-0
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.175
Like they're going to go through
the gateway and the emperor

3415aab7-6d96-41fc-b8e2-371f643dd314-1
00:23:54.175 --> 00:23:57.254
starts to draw them something.
So he takes his yellowish orange

3415aab7-6d96-41fc-b8e2-371f643dd314-2
00:23:57.254 --> 00:24:00.045
crayon and draws a crown and
puts down the boy's head and

3415aab7-6d96-41fc-b8e2-371f643dd314-3
00:24:00.045 --> 00:24:03.077
draws another crown and puts on
the girl's head. And then they

3415aab7-6d96-41fc-b8e2-371f643dd314-4
00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:06.108
turn to walk through the doorway
and wave to the emperor as he

3415aab7-6d96-41fc-b8e2-371f643dd314-5
00:24:06.108 --> 00:24:09.140
kind of bows with his hands in a
praying position at his face.

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-0
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.638
So the boy and the girl are back
underneath the bridge in the

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-1
00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:20.404
park and we see that there is.
So we're kind of looking at them

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-2
00:24:20.404 --> 00:24:23.759
from, we're underneath the
bridge, underneath the bridge

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-3
00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:27.525
looking at them and we're seeing
kind of the side of the bridge

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-4
00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:31.056
from behind. And we see the back
of the little girl and the

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-5
00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:34.704
little boy, we see the doorway
on the left and then there's a

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-6
00:24:34.704 --> 00:24:37.882
bright rainbow kind of
overarching that the city that

b6ca9e9e-4f9e-4dca-88be-64473cacde8b-7
00:24:37.882 --> 00:24:40.060
they live in and we see the
purple. 

cff36d33-70c7-4f34-90d9-31f6742c920f-0
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.410
bird, um staring off with them.
#END_quest

1116e7b7-df3c-4954-88df-b9bfe50e56c4-0
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.303
OK, good. And that was the story
and we can go on to the next

1116e7b7-df3c-4954-88df-b9bfe50e56c4-1
00:24:49.303 --> 00:24:49.770
item.

7d34c9c9-cb19-4ca5-b239-fb66440f4387-0
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.840
It's a complex scene.

52969ea9-f2bb-4997-8db6-8a7a03a6d210-0
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.290
OK.

e16febac-74c1-4e9c-aa95-3568b6659ba6-0
00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.608
#START_waldo_1 So here we have a
city scene and it almost looks

e16febac-74c1-4e9c-aa95-3568b6659ba6-1
00:25:00.608 --> 00:25:05.020
like a more like a small town
than a big urban city. So most

e16febac-74c1-4e9c-aa95-3568b6659ba6-2
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.480
of the buildings are two
stories.

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-0
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.325
And in the upper left hand area,
we have what looks like maybe a

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-1
00:25:12.325 --> 00:25:16.165
school. There's a large white
building that has a clock above

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-2
00:25:16.165 --> 00:25:20.253
a double red door and then there
is a chain link fence around it.

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-3
00:25:20.253 --> 00:25:23.845
So that looks like a school
where there are some children

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-4
00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:27.685
outside. To the right of that we
have what looks like maybe a

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-5
00:25:27.685 --> 00:25:31.215
hospital, another white
building. There's a doctor and a

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-6
00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:34.931
nurse outside and then we have
what looks like an ambulance

847ff2a0-fa19-45b1-937d-baa4b8f2379b-7
00:25:34.931 --> 00:25:36.480
coming out of a ramp way.

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-0
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.293
In kind of the upper center area
where more into town in the far

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-1
00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:45.926
right side it looks like the
police station. There's two

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-2
00:25:45.926 --> 00:25:50.133
police officers carry with a man
who looks like he's about to get

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-3
00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:54.212
booked by the policeman and to
the left of that there is a fire

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-4
00:25:54.212 --> 00:25:58.037
station with a big red fire
truck. And then continuing down

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-5
00:25:58.037 --> 00:26:01.734
it looks like we just got a
variety of some stores, so it

d7fcf0a8-1222-46f0-8d06-37cc4477dc22-6
00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:04.220
looks like there's a television
store.

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-0
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.369
With some people staring in the
front window looking at the TV's

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-1
00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:12.983
and to the left of that there's
a shoe store. And it looks like

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-2
00:26:12.983 --> 00:26:16.652
there are people that maybe live
upstairs of the shoe store. And

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-3
00:26:16.652 --> 00:26:20.266
then to the left of that we have
a mechanic. So there's kind of

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-4
00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:23.653
like an open garage area where
we have someone working on a

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-5
00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:27.097
green car with the hood popped
and then continuing down that

1c7adefb-513b-4c59-a17d-d87edfdbccb2-6
00:26:27.097 --> 00:26:29.129
block there is like a bus and
then.

e52336ac-9657-4ed6-a3db-40a42abf5ee2-0
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.475
It might be a hotel. It's a pink
building with lots of windows,

e52336ac-9657-4ed6-a3db-40a42abf5ee2-1
00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:37.979
and there's a red and white
awning outside, and then there's

e52336ac-9657-4ed6-a3db-40a42abf5ee2-2
00:26:37.979 --> 00:26:41.712
a gentleman in like a nice suit
who looks like maybe he's a bell

e52336ac-9657-4ed6-a3db-40a42abf5ee2-3
00:26:41.712 --> 00:26:45.215
boy or something. And there's
people with suitcases outside,

e52336ac-9657-4ed6-a3db-40a42abf5ee2-4
00:26:45.215 --> 00:26:47.800
so it looks like it'd be like a
ritzy hotel.

3e37a5a0-acd5-440e-94d9-b0371e28b437-0
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.673
And then as we get further down
on the bottom left hand side of

3e37a5a0-acd5-440e-94d9-b0371e28b437-1
00:26:52.673 --> 00:26:53.170
the page.

8445f7dc-0650-40ef-8f7e-5a5b1011f5f3-0
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.339
It looks like there's an office
building, so in each window you

8445f7dc-0650-40ef-8f7e-5a5b1011f5f3-1
00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:02.357
can see people sitting at
computers. It looks like kind of

8445f7dc-0650-40ef-8f7e-5a5b1011f5f3-2
00:27:02.357 --> 00:27:06.240
doing just office work. And
there are people on the roof

8445f7dc-0650-40ef-8f7e-5a5b1011f5f3-3
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.850
looks like they're either like
sweeping chimneys or.

c874417d-b507-4b97-bd52-fde3ed38ef50-0
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.550
Feeding pigeons.

a0e87de0-82b8-46b5-b0a5-6968926d05d1-0
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.810
And then and on the far right
side there looks like.

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-0
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.280
Some sort of nice building. I
don't know if it's like a

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-1
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.994
courthouse or if it's City Hall,
but there's like a little bit of

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-2
00:27:23.994 --> 00:27:27.483
a sculpture on the awning of
that building. And in the bottom

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-3
00:27:27.483 --> 00:27:30.915
there's like a market area. So
there's some different stalls

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-4
00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:34.122
with like blue and white
awnings, red and white awnings,

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-5
00:27:34.122 --> 00:27:37.610
green and white awnings, and
there looks like they're selling

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-6
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.043
different items, like plants.
And then in the center of town

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-7
00:27:41.043 --> 00:27:44.756
there's a triangular shaped area
that has a large fountain that's

2ece2d52-4a0a-4566-b559-932f2ce01b7e-8
00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:47.119
spraying water and then there's
a statue.

f5747f83-a3c4-45a2-a28a-6bb0df3c2105-0
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.483
of a man with a bow and arrow.
And then there's just some cars

f5747f83-a3c4-45a2-a28a-6bb0df3c2105-1
00:27:50.483 --> 00:27:53.165
and townspeople kind of going
about the rest of the city.

f5747f83-a3c4-45a2-a28a-6bb0df3c2105-2
00:27:53.165 --> 00:27:53.720
#END_waldo_1

8925cfbf-05c6-4bcd-a795-7c3159a2de5b-0
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.660
OK.

1902dfeb-d468-4ae3-b528-80fb81312766-0
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.290
That's good.

68f7b1c2-ae75-4d3a-b05a-e91d559b7215-0
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.810
In total we have 26 items, so
we're almost there. This is 4.

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-0
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.071
#START_by_the_lake Alright, so
here we have a lake image and

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-1
00:28:12.071 --> 00:28:16.142
it's kind of divided into 2 ish
areas. So in the center of the

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-2
00:28:16.142 --> 00:28:20.278
page is and then towards the top
you get the water and then the

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-3
00:28:20.278 --> 00:28:24.285
bottom and and kind of left and
right sides are the beach and

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-4
00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:28.485
then the one different area's in
the upper right there's more of

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-5
00:28:28.485 --> 00:28:32.621
like a woodsy cabin ish area. So
in the upper right hand corner

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-6
00:28:32.621 --> 00:28:36.886
there's different greeneries. So
we have like some conifer trees,

11f71fd7-e030-417b-bd26-5c6d28a25c54-7
00:28:36.886 --> 00:28:37.920
some pine trees.

0be5135a-e33c-4c4a-a110-336f94033f32-0
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.410
And then just some.

5592f97a-505f-4763-a79f-580a12d99b2b-0
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.050
Like regular leaf trees and a
cabin with people standing on a

5592f97a-505f-4763-a79f-580a12d99b2b-1
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.535
deck, the cabin looks like it's
made out of like wood or clay,

5592f97a-505f-4763-a79f-580a12d99b2b-2
00:28:47.535 --> 00:28:50.910
and there are people sitting at
a picnic table with a cooler

5592f97a-505f-4763-a79f-580a12d99b2b-3
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.630
eating lunch.

8feb4c71-7b05-4529-b43b-9a4b21e338a3-0
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.036
There's a small stairwell that
leads down to kind of the right

8feb4c71-7b05-4529-b43b-9a4b21e338a3-1
00:28:57.036 --> 00:29:00.356
side of the beach and there's
different people doing like

8feb4c71-7b05-4529-b43b-9a4b21e338a3-2
00:29:00.356 --> 00:29:03.962
backbends and yoga poses. And as
you kind of get more into the

8feb4c71-7b05-4529-b43b-9a4b21e338a3-3
00:29:03.962 --> 00:29:07.340
beach, there's a small dock with
people fishing off of it.

0926e024-3764-421b-a031-0c7bacd9c98d-0
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:13.223
Um, there's people wading into
the water up to their ankles,

0926e024-3764-421b-a031-0c7bacd9c98d-1
00:29:13.223 --> 00:29:17.816
and there's people building
sandcastles and igloos and

0926e024-3764-421b-a031-0c7bacd9c98d-2
00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:19.820
there's one lady riding.

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-0
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.098
what are those things called a
Segway, she's riding a Segway on

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-1
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:28.733
the beach. Probably not the best
idea. There's an umbrella, it's

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-2
00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:32.255
kind of busy for that. There's
umbrellas, lots of coolers, and

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-3
00:29:32.255 --> 00:29:35.946
the beach is cramped, so there's
not a lot of room. There's a lot

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-4
00:29:35.946 --> 00:29:39.300
of people on this beach and
they're playing different games

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-5
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.879
so that there's got there's like
soccer balls, there's shovels,

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-6
00:29:42.879 --> 00:29:46.066
there's toy trucks, there's
beach chairs that people are

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-7
00:29:46.066 --> 00:29:49.421
laying on, and there's kites
flying on the left side of the

5822fb30-7c63-4890-a016-f49acb6928f7-8
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.769
beach. We see what looks like
bocci ball.

07bd829c-2d16-4727-8fb3-7bcf8aa1b780-0
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.068
And the sand. So there's a small
ball with four larger balls

07bd829c-2d16-4727-8fb3-7bcf8aa1b780-1
00:29:55.068 --> 00:29:58.508
around it. Again, people having
fun. There's some people playing

07bd829c-2d16-4727-8fb3-7bcf8aa1b780-2
00:29:58.508 --> 00:30:01.948
sand volleyball on the left side
of the beach with a man jumping

07bd829c-2d16-4727-8fb3-7bcf8aa1b780-3
00:30:01.948 --> 00:30:03.429
up to kind of hit the spike.

ca348e1f-4574-49f4-9d38-13d4a8726c20-0
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:04.610
Um.

5c7dba83-70d2-47f0-ad94-69e12a358424-0
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.420
There's like a small like
rowboat on the.

41fd6638-ad2b-4ad8-bfa0-96ddce219c0f-0
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.166
Left side of the beach, that's
red and white but it's parked in

41fd6638-ad2b-4ad8-bfa0-96ddce219c0f-1
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.663
the sand and then in the water
we have, yeah people just wading

41fd6638-ad2b-4ad8-bfa0-96ddce219c0f-2
00:30:17.663 --> 00:30:21.159
in up into their knees. And then
we have people who are all the

41fd6638-ad2b-4ad8-bfa0-96ddce219c0f-3
00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:24.382
way in people on other people
shoulders. We have people on

41fd6638-ad2b-4ad8-bfa0-96ddce219c0f-4
00:30:24.382 --> 00:30:27.059
like different floating
apparatuses. So there's.

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-0
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.182
A large inflatable like mat.
There's some inner tubes,

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-1
00:30:31.182 --> 00:30:35.310
there's a kayak, there's like a
jumping off platform towards the

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-2
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.310
deeper area of the lake that's
jam packed with people that you

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-3
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.311
can climb up on and then jump
off. There's a jet ski, a banana

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-4
00:30:43.311 --> 00:30:47.121
boat, some paddle boarders, and
then as you get farther out

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-5
00:30:47.121 --> 00:30:51.058
there's like a large rail boat
that has like a dragon head at

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-6
00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:54.931
the front. And there are some
windsurfers, some double kayak

a8420528-2e4a-4c82-a250-5312ce7f030b-7
00:30:54.931 --> 00:30:57.979
and there are some speed boats
who are pulling.

32eec265-4572-4f77-94c5-ba73b0ccefd3-0
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.060
Water skiers. And then there's
like a water ski show where

32eec265-4572-4f77-94c5-ba73b0ccefd3-1
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.020
there's a pyramid of people
standing on skis and then with

f48a4840-1717-41b8-9d15-4f09a5bb10c4-0
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.680
Off in the distance we have some
para sailors.

ba5b31b8-9b26-476b-8156-dc8b6ef36376-0
00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.688
That's pretty much it.
#END_by_the_lake OK, sounds

ba5b31b8-9b26-476b-8156-dc8b6ef36376-1
00:31:15.688 --> 00:31:17.100
good. So then we can.

e3523f54-ec50-4c0a-a070-0e933510cea4-0
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.450
Go to the next item.

ccb8b818-60b1-48f2-867b-0ba9e75da43d-0
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.660
Quite a busy scene.

f706ca8d-5f82-4e84-8d37-25bccdb28b41-0
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.370
Like I got it without my
glasses.

15b18a51-ecf6-4f5b-ac5b-4496c8b337a6-0
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.771
They're on, but I need a
stronger prescription for this

15b18a51-ecf6-4f5b-ac5b-4496c8b337a6-1
00:31:34.771 --> 00:31:34.980
one.

04e2ea29-234a-4f92-ac13-497518a911b6-0
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.960
#START_exhibit_12 So this scene
is it looks.

89bec137-781d-4758-8efe-e5110efeb516-0
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.360
Like we're at like some sort of.

6634e64b-32b3-4c31-b062-3a96c4d04e25-0
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.600
Museum or art show or something
like that. So it's just a large.

f4921408-a8ed-4230-af0f-96447ceabfe0-0
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.270
Area that is 3 levels high and
it's very crowded, so and it's

f4921408-a8ed-4230-af0f-96447ceabfe0-1
00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:00.104
it's jam packed with people, the
walls are red and then there's a

f4921408-a8ed-4230-af0f-96447ceabfe0-2
00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:03.620
lot of different like portraits
on these walls.

8480e7e5-c112-4549-8255-7f7395b56e13-0
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.387
So on the base floor we see a
bunch of different people of all

8480e7e5-c112-4549-8255-7f7395b56e13-1
00:32:09.387 --> 00:32:13.783
different backgrounds wearing
all different types of outfits.

8480e7e5-c112-4549-8255-7f7395b56e13-2
00:32:13.783 --> 00:32:15.059
So we've got like.

57b70381-da25-4663-961a-184e03bf2af9-0
00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.940
People dressed as.

291f31c0-4279-4978-be44-b29ac83ad64f-0
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.900
Gladiators, people dressed.

de3f1384-86e4-4482-b884-673c096c8d12-0
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.650
As.

2e282a74-c282-40d3-a911-a92c1e25d345-0
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.160
Like farmers, people.

60b1cb92-8627-4189-9eef-9d597aa5cfbd-0
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.757
dressed as clowns, and they're
working on different paintings.

60b1cb92-8627-4189-9eef-9d597aa5cfbd-1
00:32:29.757 --> 00:32:33.507
So some people are painting
large portraits of like a horse

60b1cb92-8627-4189-9eef-9d597aa5cfbd-2
00:32:33.507 --> 00:32:37.632
and a knight, other are painting
pictures of like a king and then

60b1cb92-8627-4189-9eef-9d597aa5cfbd-3
00:32:37.632 --> 00:32:40.570
they're hanging some pictures on
the wall, so.

a8a8003e-a4bd-475a-89fe-cf14869c1d40-0
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.549
In the bottom right hand corner
we have like a picture of a

a8a8003e-a4bd-475a-89fe-cf14869c1d40-1
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:48.647
clown and then people are kind
of fighting over putting

a8a8003e-a4bd-475a-89fe-cf14869c1d40-2
00:32:48.647 --> 00:32:50.750
pictures up and taking pictures
down.

f619a6a5-3a56-4419-bffb-cc4aa7952046-0
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.420
And in the.

2267dc4f-fd18-40e1-bbc4-5f3a0076012b-0
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.530
Middle bottom there's a it looks
like an opening, which might be

2267dc4f-fd18-40e1-bbc4-5f3a0076012b-1
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.528
the doorway that people are
coming through, and it's very

2267dc4f-fd18-40e1-bbc4-5f3a0076012b-2
00:32:59.528 --> 00:33:02.733
crowded and people are kind of
falling and tripping over each

2267dc4f-fd18-40e1-bbc4-5f3a0076012b-3
00:33:02.733 --> 00:33:05.680
other as they're getting into
this kind of gallery area.

222742fd-d8fd-4ef5-91d4-3b08674d4f3c-0
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:11.530
And the far left there's a
person putting up a canvas.

9fe5a47a-e29a-47d4-a914-ee25573ed155-0
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.940
On the wall using like.

c93df389-e71b-41d7-8348-d28c7de48ae2-0
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.157
Some glue and paint or whatever.
And then there's a stairwell and

c93df389-e71b-41d7-8348-d28c7de48ae2-1
00:33:18.157 --> 00:33:21.419
people are carrying up different
framed photos and then so now

c93df389-e71b-41d7-8348-d28c7de48ae2-2
00:33:21.419 --> 00:33:24.422
we're on the second level, which
is again jam packed with

c93df389-e71b-41d7-8348-d28c7de48ae2-3
00:33:24.422 --> 00:33:27.529
different people, and we've got
some aliens, we've got some

c93df389-e71b-41d7-8348-d28c7de48ae2-4
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:28.720
scuba divers we've got.

47df510f-9dae-46af-8614-278b69d38f8b-0
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.270
Like a French artist.

541b8f1c-1674-4840-a651-7c26589acb49-0
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.002
There's really no rhyme or
reason to the people. And then

541b8f1c-1674-4840-a651-7c26589acb49-1
00:33:36.002 --> 00:33:38.686
again, there's different
portraits on the walls, like

541b8f1c-1674-4840-a651-7c26589acb49-2
00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:39.780
there's a man in jail.

156d8e88-bb32-4be4-80d8-41e5050e287f-0
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.667
There's what looks like a
bowling ball, maybe a man in a

156d8e88-bb32-4be4-80d8-41e5050e287f-1
00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:49.979
suit, a farmer. There are some
people on ladders on the far

156d8e88-bb32-4be4-80d8-41e5050e287f-2
00:33:49.979 --> 00:33:54.580
left side, climbing up high and
looks like they're painting on.

a7cdcfe8-141d-4060-a6e1-2a8ed9117018-0
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.759
What is the description for this
image. And then on the right

a7cdcfe8-141d-4060-a6e1-2a8ed9117018-1
00:33:58.759 --> 00:34:01.711
hand side there's another
stairwell that leads to a

a7cdcfe8-141d-4060-a6e1-2a8ed9117018-2
00:34:01.711 --> 00:34:02.620
smaller landing.

3e81eb6d-bfe5-49df-ab25-30a891d2779a-0
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.966
And again, it's jam packed with
people. These people are like

3e81eb6d-bfe5-49df-ab25-30a891d2779a-1
00:34:07.966 --> 00:34:12.546
looking at the images. There's
people taking an image down the

3e81eb6d-bfe5-49df-ab25-30a891d2779a-2
00:34:12.546 --> 00:34:16.980
stairs. There are images of a
shark and like it looks like a

3e81eb6d-bfe5-49df-ab25-30a891d2779a-3
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.580
gnome. A cowboy maybe.

f453e1aa-5683-49cd-a115-4acc93b58935-0
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.208
And they're all just kind of
staring at the different

f453e1aa-5683-49cd-a115-4acc93b58935-1
00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:25.426
pictures on the wall. And then
there's like some scaffolding

f453e1aa-5683-49cd-a115-4acc93b58935-2
00:34:25.426 --> 00:34:28.801
that a man is climbing up in the
center, but he doesn't seem to

f453e1aa-5683-49cd-a115-4acc93b58935-3
00:34:28.801 --> 00:34:32.072
be doing anything. He's just
standing on the scaffolding. And

f453e1aa-5683-49cd-a115-4acc93b58935-4
00:34:32.072 --> 00:34:35.290
that's all I want to say about
this picture. #END_exhibit_12

38e7a995-10dd-4440-a7ac-f898f0724d59-0
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:40.820
Hey, now we can go to the last
item.

de8c8f43-af74-4711-aae4-fd1adfbc563b-0
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.060
It's a part that it's.

70422325-a430-4a12-bca4-12d8cd1fc03e-0
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.560
A graphic novel part of a
graphic novel. So again is.

69bd4a26-34cd-4823-b905-d76d6802e80f-0
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:55.389
As you go through the story, you
just describe what is happening

69bd4a26-34cd-4823-b905-d76d6802e80f-1
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:56.720
and what you see, OK?

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-0
00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.729
#START_arrival_2 So this story
is starting with a group of

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-1
00:35:01.729 --> 00:35:05.986
three. It looks like people
sitting on a ship and they're

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-2
00:35:05.986 --> 00:35:10.683
kind of covered by like a white
sheet or a white blankets, like

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-3
00:35:10.683 --> 00:35:15.160
over their head. So it acts as
like a a hood or a protection

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-4
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.416
from the wind. And then we see
some men in suit coats and

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-5
00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:23.306
newsboy caps and fedoras.
There's a woman holding an

4c51592f-1a89-4991-9682-8de56d552018-6
00:35:23.306 --> 00:35:28.149
infant and then we come to a man
who is sitting on a rectangular.

b853bc54-a1da-44cb-9f39-b957835f1b31-0
00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:33.739
Prism shaped suitcase and he is
writing in a journal and then he

b853bc54-a1da-44cb-9f39-b957835f1b31-1
00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:38.290
goes to take out the page. He
rips it out and starts to fold

b853bc54-a1da-44cb-9f39-b957835f1b31-2
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:42.990
it into the shape of a bird. So
he's holding on to his origami

b853bc54-a1da-44cb-9f39-b957835f1b31-3
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.616
bird in his hand and he looks
behind him and he goes to stand

b853bc54-a1da-44cb-9f39-b957835f1b31-4
00:35:47.616 --> 00:35:47.840
up.

b8905002-3668-4189-940e-4c28d33854df-0
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.350
And then he looked up and he
sees a bunch of what looked like

b8905002-3668-4189-940e-4c28d33854df-1
00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.299
kind of like bird slash locust
slash fish creatures flying

b8905002-3668-4189-940e-4c28d33854df-2
00:35:57.299 --> 00:36:01.382
through the air and they're
going over the ship that is kind

b8905002-3668-4189-940e-4c28d33854df-3
00:36:01.382 --> 00:36:05.197
of packed with people, and all
the people are staring up

b8905002-3668-4189-940e-4c28d33854df-4
00:36:05.197 --> 00:36:08.210
looking at these creatures
flying over them.

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-0
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.001
So now it looks like we might be
looking at the ship coming into

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-1
00:36:17.001 --> 00:36:21.470
port at a city. So there's a
it's like a big shipyard, ships

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-2
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:25.939
of all different sizes. It's
kind of hazy or smoggy outside.

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-3
00:36:25.939 --> 00:36:30.334
So we don't get a very clear
image of the city and it looks

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-4
00:36:30.334 --> 00:36:34.510
very industrial and they're
coming up and we see a large

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-5
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:39.125
statue of two people. One person
is wearing like a cylindrical

482bece0-5c22-47a8-af3d-e1611050fa47-6
00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:41.690
hat and has a Bunny like
creature.

15a5b187-41bc-40f4-854c-878fca126ea9-0
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.573
with a long tail on its right
arm and then the other person is

15a5b187-41bc-40f4-854c-878fca126ea9-1
00:36:45.573 --> 00:36:49.317
wearing a cone shaped hat and
has a bird like creature on his

15a5b187-41bc-40f4-854c-878fca126ea9-2
00:36:49.317 --> 00:36:53.060
shoulder and at their feet of
the person with the Bunny has a

15a5b187-41bc-40f4-854c-878fca126ea9-3
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.683
suitcase like a cup of tea and
then it looks like some food

15a5b187-41bc-40f4-854c-878fca126ea9-4
00:36:56.683 --> 00:36:59.339
goods and then the person on the
right has.

06d2521f-dc6e-424f-9653-7d4d71021726-0
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.900
Like a pot that has a lid and a
teapot and a cone, and it looks

06d2521f-dc6e-424f-9653-7d4d71021726-1
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.709
like they're almost standing in
small ships or small boats and

06d2521f-dc6e-424f-9653-7d4d71021726-2
00:37:07.709 --> 00:37:09.040
they're shaking hands.

77f6a1a0-7b1a-41f2-aedd-f705b89cfbb9-0
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:13.657
And so we see the people on the
boat looking at this and looking

77f6a1a0-7b1a-41f2-aedd-f705b89cfbb9-1
00:37:13.657 --> 00:37:15.790
at the general picture of this
city.

fbea0256-91b4-4928-83cd-adc7fc25204c-0
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.660
So we see them kind of coming
into port. It's the ship that

fbea0256-91b4-4928-83cd-adc7fc25204c-1
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.850
they're on is massive and it
looks like it's like made of

fbea0256-91b4-4928-83cd-adc7fc25204c-2
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:27.620
iron, so it's.

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-0
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:34.168
Newish ship, but also not that
new. It's like, I don't know

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-1
00:37:34.168 --> 00:37:38.329
what age to put it at, but
Titanic era maybe. So these

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-2
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:43.095
people are coming in. We see a
couple more of those, like bird

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-3
00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:47.861
locust creatures, and then we're
back on the ship and we see a

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-4
00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:52.475
man in white talking through a
cone to amplify his voice. We

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-5
00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:57.166
see some people pulling on some
different levers and hatches,

622ceb31-3560-403b-8a9c-5a3ad23890af-6
00:37:57.166 --> 00:37:59.360
and then we see a man's hand.

423acdf1-5b98-4c04-956e-9269b00fb48a-0
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.082
His hand is gripping his
suitcase and we just kind of see

423acdf1-5b98-4c04-956e-9269b00fb48a-1
00:38:03.082 --> 00:38:06.879
a crowd of people leaving the
ship, and now they're in like a

423acdf1-5b98-4c04-956e-9269b00fb48a-2
00:38:06.879 --> 00:38:09.390
large crowded line standing on
the dock.

8c880b91-77dd-4949-99ef-6a6111ee3a64-0
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.116
With all their suitcases and
packages at their feet.

8c880b91-77dd-4949-99ef-6a6111ee3a64-1
00:38:13.116 --> 00:38:13.900
#END_arrival_2

7e25244d-fbd8-4c70-a57f-783e9673a616-0
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.810
Alright, so that's everything.

8511bb94-cf5d-4c06-904b-976b0d626906-0
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.800
