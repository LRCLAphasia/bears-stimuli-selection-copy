00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.690
OK, so first you're going to be
seeing a complex scene, so.

b2dae595-a69f-4b67-ab21-5828f4474cf5-0
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.152
Imagine you are describing the
scene to someone who cannot see

b2dae595-a69f-4b67-ab21-5828f4474cf5-1
00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:17.148
the picture. Describe what is
happening and what you see in

b2dae595-a69f-4b67-ab21-5828f4474cf5-2
00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:20.744
this scene as thoroughly as
possible, and try to take

b2dae595-a69f-4b67-ab21-5828f4474cf5-3
00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:24.674
roughly 3 to 5 minutes to
describe the scene and I'm going

b2dae595-a69f-4b67-ab21-5828f4474cf5-4
00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:25.340
to share.

79dee1be-2c35-40a8-9046-ea662559c075-0
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.420
OK, there we go.

780bf4f3-0291-43d9-a9b5-34d77307ac5c-0
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.278
OK, there we go. And I also I
keep a timer and I keep track of

780bf4f3-0291-43d9-a9b5-34d77307ac5c-1
00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:06.480
the time. So if you want to know
how long it's been or?

1a047eed-ce76-43a6-90fe-1d871964c785-0
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.102
Um, you could just ask me. And
so this is the scene. So just

1a047eed-ce76-43a6-90fe-1d871964c785-1
00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:13.750
describe what you see happening
in the scene.

cea166bb-fc7c-4f58-add0-5aa06b2b6d91-0
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.121
#START_by_the_lake The scene is
a large busy community, either

cea166bb-fc7c-4f58-add0-5aa06b2b6d91-1
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.630
lake or somewhat of a body of
water.

8a3e7b88-0b79-4e7f-b2a1-383c34c97093-0
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.195
That is very crowded. There is
beach volleyball, there is

8a3e7b88-0b79-4e7f-b2a1-383c34c97093-1
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:33.110
canoeing, there's paddle
boarding. There is.

df231eb6-40f4-43f0-8369-13b3bae2fcd3-0
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.860
Paddle boating.

c517ffcb-af31-41b7-95a7-315831daca18-0
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.380
People are swimming, people are
playful.

f1c0d06e-69dd-4634-987c-cb58ac371bb9-0
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.506
People are playing beach
volleyball with lots of of men

f1c0d06e-69dd-4634-987c-cb58ac371bb9-1
00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:49.640
and women on different teams.
Someone flying a kite.

d1a361e1-8d6b-4797-9a03-48334706f460-0
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.762
People are laying out on the
beach and socializing with

d1a361e1-8d6b-4797-9a03-48334706f460-1
00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:55.050
underneath umbrellas.

ea55e040-b4c9-4e43-8631-a1fdacf2d9ea-0
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.845
Some people are fishing. There
is a a walkway into the water,

ea55e040-b4c9-4e43-8631-a1fdacf2d9ea-1
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:01.170
kind of like a pier.

e1846594-3749-45db-b52a-f214ce4a2986-0
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.989
Someone sitting down at the end
of the pier fishing. Some kids

e1846594-3749-45db-b52a-f214ce4a2986-1
00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.961
are building sandcastles. There
looks to be a building adjacent,

e1846594-3749-45db-b52a-f214ce4a2986-2
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.749
whether that's going to be a
clubhouse or a hotel. People are

e1846594-3749-45db-b52a-f214ce4a2986-3
00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.538
walking in and out. There's a
large flagpole with a flag that

e1846594-3749-45db-b52a-f214ce4a2986-4
00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:21.021
is colored red, yellow and
green. Not sure which country

e1846594-3749-45db-b52a-f214ce4a2986-5
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:21.510
that is.

1644cd0f-82a5-4ff5-a566-fa4097e3088a-0
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.146
There's also people windsurfing,
there is some sort of team

1644cd0f-82a5-4ff5-a566-fa4097e3088a-1
00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:31.277
skiing event and they've built a
pyramid with all of the team

1644cd0f-82a5-4ff5-a566-fa4097e3088a-2
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:31.810
members.

4710a4bd-fccc-4c20-b236-ce0ab17b8ebd-0
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.408
And there is some boating and
some parasailing, some

4710a4bd-fccc-4c20-b236-ce0ab17b8ebd-1
00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:38.240
sailboats.

a7139f85-f37e-46b7-91e0-9506a770dda1-0
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.892
There are beautiful mountains in
the background with snow tipped

a7139f85-f37e-46b7-91e0-9506a770dda1-1
00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:45.520
snow covered on the tips.

e43bbbbe-3597-46c4-9330-caa66a054506-0
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.450
They looks like there's some
sort of castle esque kind of

e43bbbbe-3597-46c4-9330-caa66a054506-1
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.857
design and architecture of
another building that's adjacent

e43bbbbe-3597-46c4-9330-caa66a054506-2
00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:58.530
right on the water. Maybe that's
a hotel or home.

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-0
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.117
Lots and lots of people,
probably, you know more than 100

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-1
00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:10.042
people that are in this scene.
But everybody looks joyful and

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-2
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:14.967
playful and looks to be enjoying
the the water and the sports

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-3
00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:20.051
around the area. There are a lot
of large rocks adjacent to the

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-4
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.658
beach, so you have a sand beach
on the bottom side of the

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-5
00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:29.345
picture and there are round
rocks on both sides that about

f04a074b-00be-41c5-8aba-f3cd159895c6-6
00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:30.139
the beach.

d8cb70d7-f597-45cb-b6cb-3ea7c8e13fb5-0
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.578
Area and people are playing on
those as well and maybe jumping

d8cb70d7-f597-45cb-b6cb-3ea7c8e13fb5-1
00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:34.380
into the water.

71d2165e-0a00-48a7-b732-4fb779934312-0
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.250
There is a group of three
individuals on a jet ski.

5f07d662-909e-4f3c-b363-2a5233616e90-0
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.301
And looks like they're trying to
splash a big group of people

5f07d662-909e-4f3c-b363-2a5233616e90-1
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.711
that are on a floating dock that
are just hanging out or jumping

5f07d662-909e-4f3c-b363-2a5233616e90-2
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:47.969
in and out of the water.

d34011ad-a6fd-4a52-ad57-3b26a1ab12aa-0
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.740
There is a dog.

e5ef7fa3-917a-4a8f-88b4-642c29d6f788-0
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.407
Maybe more than
one dog, but I see one dog that

e5ef7fa3-917a-4a8f-88b4-642c29d6f788-1
00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:59.092
is that is having a great time.
In the scene there is a girl

e5ef7fa3-917a-4a8f-88b4-642c29d6f788-2
00:03:59.092 --> 00:04:02.839
doing gymnastics or 2 girls, 3
girls doing gymnastics or yoga

e5ef7fa3-917a-4a8f-88b4-642c29d6f788-3
00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.585
up by the clubhouse right on the
beach. There's some cyclists

e5ef7fa3-917a-4a8f-88b4-642c29d6f788-4
00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:10.391
that are that are riding through
the rocks. I assume there's a

e5ef7fa3-917a-4a8f-88b4-642c29d6f788-5
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.600
path there as well. #END_by_the_lake 

fcdd3529-7770-45d5-98fe-5a762eb17134-0
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.190
How am I doing on time?

a3a0fa14-9b0e-40cf-be0a-646ec089cc1c-0
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.350
You're good here, let me.

ef5815ec-7d5d-4515-ae32-5669de8a1277-0
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.600
Let me see what's next.

a286561e-c5f1-42e5-8e4f-73f56a690639-0
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.380
OK, NEXT is another complex
scene. Let me pull it up.

2b24d994-cb0b-4b42-a1a4-3b2e4b2a6078-0
00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:07.420


e5a3bf3b-349d-45c8-beea-f7a9e735a373-0
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.900
OK.

cc22e9ba-4c48-45f4-9ea2-990d2aa925ea-0
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.475
Let me go ahead and get started.
You can get started. This is

cc22e9ba-4c48-45f4-9ea2-990d2aa925ea-1
00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:35.029
also just a scene. OK.
#START_waldo_1 so this is the

cc22e9ba-4c48-45f4-9ea2-990d2aa925ea-2
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.260
Waldo scene. It looks like it's
in a city center.

c8c982bb-e9f5-4ac9-b707-924ce8e11c2f-0
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.054
Most of the buildings are two
stories, and I would say that

c8c982bb-e9f5-4ac9-b707-924ce8e11c2f-1
00:05:43.054 --> 00:05:46.926
the main portion of the scene is
in a square. In this particular

c8c982bb-e9f5-4ac9-b707-924ce8e11c2f-2
00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:50.678
instance, it's a triangle with a
large fountain in the middle,

c8c982bb-e9f5-4ac9-b707-924ce8e11c2f-3
00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:54.133
and there are people walking
across the street and on the

c8c982bb-e9f5-4ac9-b707-924ce8e11c2f-4
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:57.410
sidewalks, and there are cars
driving down the street.

5d01ae29-9a8a-4a5d-9319-aaf81d46d8b3-0
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.602
I see multiple cars. There are
two red cars, a green car, a

5d01ae29-9a8a-4a5d-9319-aaf81d46d8b3-1
00:06:02.602 --> 00:06:04.470
blue car, a yellow truck.

14d6a8ca-55b1-443a-b441-04fdee9d9801-0
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.212
A purple car and it looks like a
red fire engine coming out of

14d6a8ca-55b1-443a-b441-04fdee9d9801-1
00:06:10.212 --> 00:06:11.820
the fire department.

bb7de229-c424-43e3-829c-a269bb892681-0
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.843
All of the buildings are about
two stories, but they're all

bb7de229-c424-43e3-829c-a269bb892681-1
00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:20.333
different colors. So we have a
pink building and a white

bb7de229-c424-43e3-829c-a269bb892681-2
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:24.191
building. The Yellow Building,
Green building, a red building.

bb7de229-c424-43e3-829c-a269bb892681-3
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:27.130
There are some red rooftops and
green rooftops.

e253bd7d-a9fd-49f4-a3f3-4012328f2a2c-0
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.294
There are windows and within the
building it looks like a lot of

e253bd7d-a9fd-49f4-a3f3-4012328f2a2c-1
00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:35.990
them have shops at the bottom on
the ground floor and I would

e253bd7d-a9fd-49f4-a3f3-4012328f2a2c-2
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.090
imagine that residential units
on the second story.

e0e39a46-5339-42cf-a34a-a822075f753d-0
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.900
And it looks like on the bottom
right there's some sort of maybe

e0e39a46-5339-42cf-a34a-a822075f753d-1
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.530
courthouse.

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-0
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.039
And and a window washer is on
that building cleaning those

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-1
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.001
windows on this on the bottom of
the picture there looks like

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-2
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.579
there's a little market so
people have stands and maybe

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-3
00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:00.413
they can't tell what they're
selling plants or fresh fruit.

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-4
00:07:00.413 --> 00:07:03.991
Lots of people around walking
their dogs and with their

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-5
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:07.825
children probably shopping in
the market. There is a larger

6de0ba06-df05-4ac0-a385-1bc10aaa27b8-6
00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:08.720
building with.

82af5c9d-bad3-4b39-9ab2-32c71a1dd01e-0
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.266
Ladder going up to the rooftop.
It looks like there's some

82af5c9d-bad3-4b39-9ab2-32c71a1dd01e-1
00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:17.243
maintenance or construction
going on, and some workers are

82af5c9d-bad3-4b39-9ab2-32c71a1dd01e-2
00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:20.371
working on that building. So
there's some men on the roof and

82af5c9d-bad3-4b39-9ab2-32c71a1dd01e-3
00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:21.330
some on the ladder.

5b41bb85-706e-4c79-87a2-eefafc777288-0
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.181
The ground floors are typically
retail and they have some awning

5b41bb85-706e-4c79-87a2-eefafc777288-1
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.900
red and white stripe awnings.

fc46cece-8c65-4bd7-8332-b2fd49a66f4a-0
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.600
On the ground floor.

9189425f-23e0-4c3c-be7d-4d931aaa1425-0
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.860
It's an active
scene, like like a busy city. #END_waldo_1

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.160
OK, let me see what's next.

cd3f939d-79cc-431f-b199-d6a877fc4909-0
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.710
OK, NEXT is another complex
scene.

87ee2eb1-0f01-4c5b-af79-3cfa82afb4d0-0
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.100
OK.

d931c06c-0845-4454-bdc0-8ca3028d5e35-0
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.460
#START_airport OK, this scene is
at an airport and there are.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.090
OK, five or six

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-0
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.252
7 large airplanes and one small
airplane. It looks very hectic

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-1
00:08:30.252 --> 00:08:34.591
and there are a lot of people
waiting in lines within the

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-2
00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:39.303
airport itself on the bottom of
the of the scene of the photo.

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-3
00:08:39.303 --> 00:08:44.091
Lots of people are exiting and
entering airplanes on the tarmac

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-4
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:49.028
itself and it looks like there's
a fire. A fire hydrant is trying

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-5
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:53.591
to put out a fire. There are
broken boxes and luggage strewn

df04cc03-58b5-4a69-9e72-6736c6927a6a-6
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:54.040
about.

c6f366de-a8cf-454e-a983-631f085543ec-0
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.833
It looked very unorganized and
hectic. You have some people

c6f366de-a8cf-454e-a983-631f085543ec-1
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:03.650
waiting in line, but really
there are a lot of workers

c6f366de-a8cf-454e-a983-631f085543ec-2
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.605
trying to figure out what's
going on. There are men with

c6f366de-a8cf-454e-a983-631f085543ec-3
00:09:07.605 --> 00:09:10.866
arms up and looking very
concerned. There is a

c6f366de-a8cf-454e-a983-631f085543ec-4
00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:11.629
watchtower.

c350cd60-946b-42c5-843d-dae5b141ec17-0
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.384
I don't remember what they
called those, but the watchtower

c350cd60-946b-42c5-843d-dae5b141ec17-1
00:09:16.384 --> 00:09:19.669
for airplanes at the airport
that's surrounded by glass and

c350cd60-946b-42c5-843d-dae5b141ec17-2
00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:22.516
has all the antennas on top.
There's a blimp in the

c350cd60-946b-42c5-843d-dae5b141ec17-3
00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:25.089
background. There's some planes
up in the sky.

ab012413-ccb2-4773-a760-e37450109e07-0
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.887
It looks like a very busy,
hectic scene at an airport.

ab012413-ccb2-4773-a760-e37450109e07-1
00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:35.303
There's luggage everywhere. I
see a luggage carousel where

ab012413-ccb2-4773-a760-e37450109e07-2
00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:39.870
luggage is being returned to
their owners from the airplane.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.990
There is some diesel fuel
trucks.

26d6cfd1-fe68-4655-a823-91df238cdc06-0
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.838
That are filling up one of the
airplanes. There is a baggage

26d6cfd1-fe68-4655-a823-91df238cdc06-1
00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:51.739
handler taking luggage out to an
airplane. There's a bus with a

26d6cfd1-fe68-4655-a823-91df238cdc06-2
00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:54.300
line of people waiting to get on
the bus.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.510
There are lots of packages and
big boxes.

0d35594d-44f7-446b-a19a-c15514a17efc-0
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.210
That are much larger than
suitcases.

0cd794ff-ce7c-462c-b707-ba28daa27d08-0
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.611
Planes are all different colors.
There's a blue plane, a green

0cd794ff-ce7c-462c-b707-ba28daa27d08-1
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.430

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.850
And a smaller
orange plane. #END_airport

Yeah.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.080
Oh, wow.

bc53bef9-d21a-4aed-8146-5ef3bdb0a770-0
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.847
#START_picture_this So this is a
collage of photos or portraits

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.080
People and things and animals.

There's a dog, there is a robot,
there's a bear.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:36.336
Holding something up to a man
that looks like a cave person, a

cb7d9b95-a749-4be7-a3ac-891c73ab2d88-1
00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:36.980
cowboy.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.269
They're all small photos, like
from a measurement perspective,

8a407b0e-1f27-4a89-a095-712cc9b96ab2-1
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.240
they're they're quite tiny.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.079
There's a caveman in the bottom
right corner without a photo, so

111a3fef-1d59-44e6-b715-6073651c9e31-1
00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:53.789
I'm not sure quite what he's
doing. On the scene. There are

111a3fef-1d59-44e6-b715-6073651c9e31-2
00:11:53.789 --> 00:11:57.252
pictures of people running.
There is a gentleman a bald

00:11:57.252 --> 00:12:01.024
gentleman with with a mustache.
There is a palm tree. I see.

00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:02.880
Looks like there's a dinosaur.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.570
Another bear, a pink bear,
another caveman.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.360
There is a photo of a hand that
looks a little.

ecba8fa9-8fd3-4f2b-96d3-c55f8eadda21-0
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.531
Scary. I'm not quite sure what
that hand is is doing. Umm,

ecba8fa9-8fd3-4f2b-96d3-c55f8eadda21-1
00:12:16.531 --> 00:12:21.031
there is a an image of a fist
holding a fist up. There's some

ecba8fa9-8fd3-4f2b-96d3-c55f8eadda21-2
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:22.119
fish and other.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.130
Looks like it's some sort of
there's a man and woman. There

dda9e5d7-4d41-4446-b929-38ed7f707470-1
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.321
are two people in uniform. Looks
like a baseball uniform, quite

dda9e5d7-4d41-4446-b929-38ed7f707470-2
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:32.769
possibly.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.320
There's a cactus, a photo of a
cactus.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.040
Umm.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.746
There's a photo of a of a man
holding multiple plates on his

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:45.090

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.753
 The big
collage of photos and images

2eab1412-2eb2-4507-a4b0-8027e0b3f23d-1
00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:51.010

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.100
That efficient

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.950
But perfect. Let me see what's
next.

648108b4-0386-4924-bc9d-4f4be5606218-0
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.510
Next is another complex scene
actually.

1901c2e2-be68-41d3-b8a7-7e98173fa90f-0
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:26.930
OK.

70b20783-c6cf-4f25-824a-13632a8550ed-0
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.361
#START_exhibit_12 Wow. OK, this
is a very hectic, very crowded

70b20783-c6cf-4f25-824a-13632a8550ed-1
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.649
scene. There are probably
hundreds of individuals in this

70b20783-c6cf-4f25-824a-13632a8550ed-2
00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:45.690
scene. Looks like it's at a
museum.

ed6af7d2-febb-4ccf-a073-f2a27266999e-0
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.140
Umm.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.653
It's a it looks like a portrait
museum, so you've got lots of

261f045d-455a-4cb6-8f5a-e9fb53c18393-1
00:13:52.653 --> 00:13:55.777
portraits on the wall of
individuals. Looks like all

261f045d-455a-4cb6-8f5a-e9fb53c18393-2
00:13:55.777 --> 00:13:56.190
people.

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-0
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.256
But there are tons of people
crowded kind of shoulder to

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-1
00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:04.528
shoulder in some of these
spaces. It's 3 tiered, so

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-2
00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:08.491
there's a ground floor with some
stairs leading up to a second

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-3
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:12.455
story and then stairs leading up
to a third story as well. But

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-4
00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:16.356
there are portraits covering all
the red walls and all of the

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-5
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:20.257
frames are different colors and
majority of the portraits are

b4e29304-d8cf-4c3f-98d3-e3a70602c6cc-6
00:14:20.257 --> 00:14:22.900
people. I do see a flower, I see
a shark.

aaba194c-a1ef-4c58-bf72-5408242393c2-0
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.000
And they're all in different
shapes, so some of them are

aaba194c-a1ef-4c58-bf72-5408242393c2-1
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.530

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.120
frames and the the portraits
themselves. The stairwells are

aaba194c-a1ef-4c58-bf72-5408242393c2-3
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.770
white and some of the pillars
they hold up. The second story

aaba194c-a1ef-4c58-bf72-5408242393c2-4
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.539
is white, and the balconies, the
hand rails are white as well,

aaba194c-a1ef-4c58-bf72-5408242393c2-5
00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:45.369
but the rest of the actual room
is red. The walls I can't quite

aaba194c-a1ef-4c58-bf72-5408242393c2-6
00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:48.660
see the floor, although the
floor looks white as well.

9e338119-7e8b-49d2-9065-d6c5f07489d6-0
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.140
And there are lots of people
here in this scene.

399f846f-c75d-4287-9679-93d605d49e43-0
00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.728
Wearing all different kind of
attire doesn't even look like

399f846f-c75d-4287-9679-93d605d49e43-1
00:15:00.728 --> 00:15:01.070
fully.

bd0fea81-4924-4482-87f1-28098bbdf151-0
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.450
Casual clothes. Some of them may
have costume on.

bc4fb1ab-fcff-472a-b0c7-7fd4278eaf8e-0
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.218
Some people are stealing frames.
They're pushing frames down from

bc4fb1ab-fcff-472a-b0c7-7fd4278eaf8e-1
00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:14.352
the second story to the first
story. Looks like they may be

bc4fb1ab-fcff-472a-b0c7-7fd4278eaf8e-2
00:15:14.352 --> 00:15:15.450
trying to steal them.

29810d63-54c3-48bf-847d-df9d21940962-0
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.832
And people are walking larger
frames down the staircases as

29810d63-54c3-48bf-847d-df9d21940962-1
00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:23.405
well. Some people are holding on
to frames. It looks like a

29810d63-54c3-48bf-847d-df9d21940962-2
00:15:23.405 --> 00:15:24.179
hectic scene.

6e9c7b04-f2b2-4e3a-9029-bdf146584ca0-0
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.120
And there are a number of people
on a ladder on the left portion

6e9c7b04-f2b2-4e3a-9029-bdf146584ca0-1
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.649
of the scene that I'm not sure
where they're climbing towards,

6e9c7b04-f2b2-4e3a-9029-bdf146584ca0-2
00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:36.177
but there are there's a ladder
on the wall with people hanging

6e9c7b04-f2b2-4e3a-9029-bdf146584ca0-3
00:15:36.177 --> 00:15:36.850
off of them.

c1d0a59b-f081-4d27-b8e7-ea4bea8a3b8e-0
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.260
You know 10 to 12 people on each
of those two ladders.

eaa131d6-fed7-466c-9485-2d6c31840e7a-0
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.533
There looks like
there's some workers trying to

eaa131d6-fed7-466c-9485-2d6c31840e7a-1
00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:48.565
hang a portrait and one of the
it's in three pieces and the

eaa131d6-fed7-466c-9485-2d6c31840e7a-2
00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:49.930
third piece is upside down. #END_exhibit_12 

fa4d2141-9c3d-47aa-bb93-88c203847708-0
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.220
Is that good?

ea0e6c67-53fe-43e0-95db-70f528e0a535-0
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.010
Hey, let's see what's next.

207ee726-7034-4791-96b0-b44f1b2d4e1b-0
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.520
OK, NEXT is another complex
scene.

9f0768a6-6e60-434d-9197-663861f65ae4-0
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.170
OK.

3c9265d2-3c41-492b-a484-011681fabdc5-0
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.690
#START_wild_west OK, this looks
like a scene from an old city.

b52c15c9-24f6-4604-9e18-3d2701e0005d-0
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.073
There is a saloon. There are
multiple saloons, kind of from

b52c15c9-24f6-4604-9e18-3d2701e0005d-1
00:16:42.073 --> 00:16:43.230
the wild Wild West.

13abe7da-3f02-47b1-9cf7-7b439681cd71-0
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.954
And it is very crowded. There
are people everywhere there. I

13abe7da-3f02-47b1-9cf7-7b439681cd71-1
00:16:48.954 --> 00:16:53.529
see a jail building, I see a
hotel, a saloon, a general

13abe7da-3f02-47b1-9cf7-7b439681cd71-2
00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:54.020
store.

ae7565cf-8593-48eb-904a-44a32f23006a-0
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.850
Multiple hotels.

8afd88f1-8cb1-4836-81c9-933d0eadb870-0
00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.000
Tavern.

8ffcdbed-dbd5-4906-9daf-c89c2008647f-0
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.430
Multiple saloons here.

fa01fd3c-f5db-4ac9-ae4b-252efac52d7c-0
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.945
That most of the buildings are
two stories and there are people

fa01fd3c-f5db-4ac9-ae4b-252efac52d7c-1
00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:11.660
everywhere. The road is not the
road. It looks like it's some

fa01fd3c-f5db-4ac9-ae4b-252efac52d7c-2
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.440
sort of dirt.

0370f9ad-c74d-4ea0-a198-d25cf6db9432-0
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.039
And some sort of dirt road.
There are people on on balconies

0370f9ad-c74d-4ea0-a198-d25cf6db9432-1
00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:22.119
hanging out at the saloon. They
see a bank and it looks like

0370f9ad-c74d-4ea0-a198-d25cf6db9432-2
00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.390
there's a carriage.

a15996f8-4d6f-4a62-b180-b600ca704d19-0
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.685
That is right in front of a
train that looks at the train is

a15996f8-4d6f-4a62-b180-b600ca704d19-1
00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:29.240
about to hit the carriage.

1b569fca-22fa-4fde-ac36-31c48e5aba8a-0
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.330
Umm.

ac9d7e3b-9553-4c04-bf2c-eb27039733ae-0
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.088
People are climbing on the
second story. It looks like

ac9d7e3b-9553-4c04-bf2c-eb27039733ae-1
00:17:37.088 --> 00:17:40.773
there may be a either a robbery
or a fight breaking out on in

ac9d7e3b-9553-4c04-bf2c-eb27039733ae-2
00:17:40.773 --> 00:17:43.210
one of the scenes in one of the
saloons.

78ed71ee-8e5e-44d9-9076-3e4cce1ffeb6-0
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.620
There are horses.

2bfb7348-3394-4a02-9d00-c456c848c7d1-0
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.160
There's a.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.950
Painting looks like of a horse
drawn carriage, a covered wagon.

e3cd71fa-1cd1-4ffa-a45f-d71c50021393-0
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.502
There's lots of lots of people.
It's very crowded and hectic,

e3cd71fa-1cd1-4ffa-a45f-d71c50021393-1
00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:05.285
and there are a lot of cowboy
hats being worn by the men. They

e3cd71fa-1cd1-4ffa-a45f-d71c50021393-2
00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:08.948
don't see a ton of women out
here, although there are a few.

e3cd71fa-1cd1-4ffa-a45f-d71c50021393-3
00:18:08.948 --> 00:18:11.710
One I see is that we're in a
long pink dress.

66381a9d-8fa4-4d66-bb09-f220ed41d204-0
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.500
Women have mostly long.

b3063fcc-9f3f-4f39-9bc0-1f4aa0acda66-0
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.937
Shirts and long skirts on the
men are in pants and cowboy

b3063fcc-9f3f-4f39-9bc0-1f4aa0acda66-1
00:18:21.937 --> 00:18:23.500
hats. All different colors.

a3986ca2-47cb-495f-98f7-9508822933b0-0
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.668
At the very colorful scene, each
of the buildings are different

a3986ca2-47cb-495f-98f7-9508822933b0-1
00:18:27.668 --> 00:18:28.010
colors.

e989b06c-51c2-4562-8886-8332b75c10de-0
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.297
And their signs are in different
colors as well that are large on

e989b06c-51c2-4562-8886-8332b75c10de-1
00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:34.430
the building itself.

9f0a3264-d277-4b88-93af-5a63524cad1d-0
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.313
I see a jail
scene and a wanted poster with

9f0a3264-d277-4b88-93af-5a63524cad1d-1
00:18:40.313 --> 00:18:44.623
two drawings or photos of people
and a sheriff sign next to the

9f0a3264-d277-4b88-93af-5a63524cad1d-2
00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:44.960
jail. #END_wild_west 

dd53f2fc-6752-462a-8655-5f99f5046ce1-0
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.060
Is that good?

7411fdbc-711b-4afc-8f84-28b0043eafd7-0
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.140
Hey, let's see.

210b8f9b-d1b6-4f40-aed3-b910c875874a-0
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.374
OK, next we have our first
story. I'm going to pull up the

210b8f9b-d1b6-4f40-aed3-b910c875874a-1
00:19:03.374 --> 00:19:04.600
directions for that.

ebedcc81-f2fa-4ee6-a5ec-e53e77cb08da-0
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.610
OK.

f7d5adae-1df6-4701-8c31-1eaecff0fdc6-0
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.221
So you are about to look at a
series of pictures that tell a

f7d5adae-1df6-4701-8c31-1eaecff0fdc6-1
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:23.620
story.

11d94df4-7e08-455d-8db4-ca825be75125-0
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.280
Imagine you are telling the
story to someone who cannot see

11d94df4-7e08-455d-8db4-ca825be75125-1
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.160
the pictures. Describe what you
see and what is happening as you

11d94df4-7e08-455d-8db4-ca825be75125-2
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.100
go through the story. And so let
me see what the first story is.

f221a657-7116-4dad-a8b4-196807db371b-0
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.150
OK.

51868755-0551-414b-943e-a775a43b54fb-0
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.490
OK, this story is.

7335e91a-32c5-4e6b-bbc6-7a4ea4dc60f7-0
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.630
8 slides. So after you describe
like the first slide, you could

7335e91a-32c5-4e6b-bbc6-7a4ea4dc60f7-1
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.470
tell me to move on to the next
slide.

96ec480b-f71e-4bc7-aacb-55e5759aa487-0
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.040
Here and I will share my
screen.

80f5a537-1a5a-47e6-b4c6-c24557f66ea4-0
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.110
OK.

0ba8020d-abdb-4b38-8d1b-4139727aab45-0
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.992
#START_arrival_4 This looks like
a gentleman getting ready. He is

0ba8020d-abdb-4b38-8d1b-4139727aab45-1
00:20:38.992 --> 00:20:39.550
showering.

1d75d587-cf8f-4bdc-90b4-8df8d0b82978-0
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.038
First, he is shaving and getting
dressed. He has it looks like a

1d75d587-cf8f-4bdc-90b4-8df8d0b82978-1
00:20:45.038 --> 00:20:47.050
three piece suit on a black.

b102df0d-6dfc-49cb-9bec-21e2c560873a-0
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.360
And that's that. He's buttoning
under a white collared shirt,

b102df0d-6dfc-49cb-9bec-21e2c560873a-1
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.380
black pants and black shoes.
He's tying his shoes last.

d9d849fe-bc4e-4a11-a956-e582cfc81a7d-0
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.336
It looks like he has maybe money
or something in his hand that

d9d849fe-bc4e-4a11-a956-e582cfc81a7d-1
00:21:02.336 --> 00:21:06.931
he's put in his pocket and he
grabs his Black Hat, kind of

d9d849fe-bc4e-4a11-a956-e582cfc81a7d-2
00:21:06.931 --> 00:21:11.837
like a top hat and pulls out a
map and looks like he is trying

d9d849fe-bc4e-4a11-a956-e582cfc81a7d-3
00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:14.330
to find his way into a location.

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-0
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:20.105
And he is looking at the map on
a street and there is a small

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-1
00:21:20.105 --> 00:21:24.474
animal, I want to say an
animated animal. It's not an

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-2
00:21:24.474 --> 00:21:29.408
animal that exists in real life
that is following him on the

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-3
00:21:29.408 --> 00:21:34.424
street. And this scene looks
like a futuristic city with high

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-4
00:21:34.424 --> 00:21:39.197
rise highways with cone shaped
buildings with holes in the

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-5
00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:43.889
middle of them. People are
dressed like they would in the

0211c7f6-2964-40ef-81ff-daffd1fda5d3-6
00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:44.860
early 1900s.

6300fc00-1053-477b-ad76-5e171efa749e-0
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.145
But the scene behind them are
are, you know, multiple story

6300fc00-1053-477b-ad76-5e171efa749e-1
00:21:49.145 --> 00:21:53.460
tall bridges with floating looks
like ships in the air, and the

6300fc00-1053-477b-ad76-5e171efa749e-2
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.573
gentleman is is still looking
intently at the map, trying to

6300fc00-1053-477b-ad76-5e171efa749e-3
00:21:57.573 --> 00:21:58.450
find his way.

9b2a1dce-2151-40cb-b71f-1c4b389c0e89-0
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.588
There are now two animals with
this gentleman that both have

9b2a1dce-2151-40cb-b71f-1c4b389c0e89-1
00:22:12.588 --> 00:22:17.222
one has cone shaped ears, looks
like almost a bird and the other

9b2a1dce-2151-40cb-b71f-1c4b389c0e89-2
00:22:17.222 --> 00:22:21.785
has a cone shaped body with you
know, puppy dog ears and a long

9b2a1dce-2151-40cb-b71f-1c4b389c0e89-3
00:22:21.785 --> 00:22:22.570
curly tail.

eb09e018-17c9-4867-9ff9-50dfa185985b-0
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.236
The man asks. A woman on the
street looks like he's asking

eb09e018-17c9-4867-9ff9-50dfa185985b-1
00:22:27.236 --> 00:22:30.110
her direction and she's trying
to show him where to go.

7a3244b1-a845-435f-beb9-1d3e24a19190-0
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.650
The woman.

b300a1e0-bfa4-4859-9be5-8d3a28eb0216-0
00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.617
It looks like a robot, or some
sort of robot approaches the

b300a1e0-bfa4-4859-9be5-8d3a28eb0216-1
00:22:37.617 --> 00:22:41.902
woman. It has a dial tone
similar to what an old telephone

b300a1e0-bfa4-4859-9be5-8d3a28eb0216-2
00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:46.405
would look like. She's dialing
something on the robot stomach

b300a1e0-bfa4-4859-9be5-8d3a28eb0216-3
00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:50.689
or center of its body and pulls
a lever. When the lever is

b300a1e0-bfa4-4859-9be5-8d3a28eb0216-4
00:22:50.689 --> 00:22:55.120
pulled, something shoots out of
what looks like a a speaker.

0a35c41d-cbf1-4009-8fe1-8ed3ffbca266-0
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.343
I can't tell what's on the
paper, but the woman takes this

0a35c41d-cbf1-4009-8fe1-8ed3ffbca266-1
00:22:59.343 --> 00:23:01.400
piece of paper and hands it to
the man.

a8db7ef2-9203-481f-9e8e-728bfc288fa5-0
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:04.620
And.

f8ec4707-c2c1-48e7-9d0c-77ec13a2f9de-0
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.904
And maybe it looks like a
ticket, because I now see

f8ec4707-c2c1-48e7-9d0c-77ec13a2f9de-1
00:23:09.904 --> 00:23:12.910
individuals waving at a flying
ship.

cc910250-a348-44e0-8318-5f345e1e079d-0
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.290
Umm.

cdbc029e-a30c-4cc6-a584-ff8a6e9b1453-0
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.717
That is much, much, much larger
than the individuals themselves.

cdbc029e-a30c-4cc6-a584-ff8a6e9b1453-1
00:23:19.717 --> 00:23:22.160
It reminds me of kind of the
Titanic, the size.

225fa6f7-fef1-4ae3-bca0-d690fddcb733-0
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.170


6f95c689-aed4-4641-9b9d-4bc508ea4fc2-0
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.842
And it looks like the man along
with the animal with the tail

6f95c689-aed4-4641-9b9d-4bc508ea4fc2-1
00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:33.734
get on the ship, and somebody as
a conductor or some person

6f95c689-aed4-4641-9b9d-4bc508ea4fc2-2
00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:36.200
working on the ship takes the
ticket.

de91648f-1a42-4adf-958f-a2c43043569a-0
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.911
The man sits down on this ship
or device with this animal

de91648f-1a42-4adf-958f-a2c43043569a-1
00:23:44.911 --> 00:23:49.074
sitting next to him and he looks
like he's speaking to a female

de91648f-1a42-4adf-958f-a2c43043569a-2
00:23:49.074 --> 00:23:53.301
sitting next to him. The female
is holding the other animal with

de91648f-1a42-4adf-958f-a2c43043569a-3
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:57.463
the cone shaped ears in her lap.
The man seems to be talking to

de91648f-1a42-4adf-958f-a2c43043569a-4
00:23:57.463 --> 00:24:00.260
this woman and pulls out a piece
of paper.

c396120c-3944-4bb8-9513-61eed4d3fde0-0
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.360
And I'm not sure, but it has a
photo on this piece of paper. It

c396120c-3944-4bb8-9513-61eed4d3fde0-1
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.640
looks like a young girl.

a54c5fc6-9d90-4e79-abe1-761bbe9efd1d-0
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.180
And he's showing this woman this
photo and she opens it up.

0efbb1a8-b696-4c2b-8358-1ab8da70dc06-0
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.901
And she's showing another paper
with another photo of a young

0efbb1a8-b696-4c2b-8358-1ab8da70dc06-1
00:24:16.901 --> 00:24:19.856
girl. I'm not sure if the
gentleman had a young girl or

0efbb1a8-b696-4c2b-8358-1ab8da70dc06-2
00:24:19.856 --> 00:24:22.969
boy on this photo, but it's a
small photo of a young girl.

8894401b-af40-461a-a00b-308b19c0ad4e-0
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.531
This young girl is now in a
different scene is reading a

8894401b-af40-461a-a00b-308b19c0ad4e-1
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:34.163
book and it looks like it's
getting reprimanded for reading

8894401b-af40-461a-a00b-308b19c0ad4e-2
00:24:34.163 --> 00:24:35.980
and the book is put away in a.

e4d315ef-b7ba-404d-ae48-f5e55974efd1-0
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.017
In a drawer and locked and it's
getting punished. And now the

e4d315ef-b7ba-404d-ae48-f5e55974efd1-1
00:24:40.017 --> 00:24:43.545
girl has to go outside and work
with the shovel and in the rain

e4d315ef-b7ba-404d-ae48-f5e55974efd1-2
00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:45.640
and then snow, and then the
elements.

768e8ed6-35da-4a26-bac1-7363ec157826-0
00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:50.399
And and it's looking like it's
she's putting coal inside of a

768e8ed6-35da-4a26-bac1-7363ec157826-1
00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:53.090
fire and working kind of in a in
a coal.

4636c212-0ccb-4fe3-a948-77d6dcd995d0-0
00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.420
Some sort of fire smokestack

c8b99569-c644-4e94-a82c-d4bd216d0fa5-0
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.064
It's still showing this at the
scene with this girl. Looks like

c8b99569-c644-4e94-a82c-d4bd216d0fa5-1
00:25:09.064 --> 00:25:10.500
she's working in a large.

97e4bb34-84f3-4209-ad2e-9810f2c36d1c-0
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:16.681
Kind of Labor site for young
adults or young children. She

97e4bb34-84f3-4209-ad2e-9810f2c36d1c-1
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:21.242
looks scared and unhappy and
sad. She's trying to to get out

97e4bb34-84f3-4209-ad2e-9810f2c36d1c-2
00:25:21.242 --> 00:25:25.803
and escape, but she goes in to
get her book to make sure she

97e4bb34-84f3-4209-ad2e-9810f2c36d1c-3
00:25:25.803 --> 00:25:30.589
can bring her book with her and
looks like she's escaping this.

97e4bb34-84f3-4209-ad2e-9810f2c36d1c-4
00:25:30.589 --> 00:25:32.010
There are multiple.

a29cfd6d-2e84-4330-9071-05d4e9eca5bd-0
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.565
Smokestacks and multiple
children and or individuals

a29cfd6d-2e84-4330-9071-05d4e9eca5bd-1
00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:39.500
she's escaping with her book.

fae210e3-c641-4a45-8bc9-f956fc02a526-0
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.460
And looks like she gets on a
train.

5ce7ccf2-c295-4b4b-8a7d-c838312b79b8-0
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.140
To flee the scene.

188c2739-35c8-4740-a3fd-4a39c7c7f60f-0
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.873
The next scene shows this looks
like it's a some sort of Asian

188c2739-35c8-4740-a3fd-4a39c7c7f60f-1
00:25:54.873 --> 00:25:58.828
language, the smokestack and
flying ship. There is a flying

188c2739-35c8-4740-a3fd-4a39c7c7f60f-2
00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:03.048
ship and there's smokestack on
the flying ship, but it's flying

188c2739-35c8-4740-a3fd-4a39c7c7f60f-3
00:26:03.048 --> 00:26:06.674
with billboards in the
background that looks like it's

188c2739-35c8-4740-a3fd-4a39c7c7f60f-4
00:26:06.674 --> 00:26:08.520
some sort of Asian language.

eaab6709-6919-47a9-83a4-1b6bc4ed456a-0
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.527
The scene shows again the male
and the female on the ship and

eaab6709-6919-47a9-83a4-1b6bc4ed456a-1
00:26:13.527 --> 00:26:16.110
some sort of conductor making an
announcement.

9c92d948-a894-41da-84e6-a1d9b16bf723-0
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.917
They shake hands and manomin
make shake hands goodbye. The

9c92d948-a894-41da-84e6-a1d9b16bf723-1
00:26:20.917 --> 00:26:25.079
man walks away with the animal
by his side and he is pondering

9c92d948-a894-41da-84e6-a1d9b16bf723-2
00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:29.108
and looking out into the scene.
The scene is of a very, very

9c92d948-a894-41da-84e6-a1d9b16bf723-3
00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:33.204
large building of an animal with
some homes and some walkways

9c92d948-a894-41da-84e6-a1d9b16bf723-4
00:26:33.204 --> 00:26:34.790
surrounding this animal.

8675a76f-b6b1-4193-a52e-b22300b125a7-0
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.520
Looked very futuristic,
futuristic.

25c84a9b-3b79-42ff-b011-8c2f0eda127e-0
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.300
Not kind of our everyday city.

1c004787-4fee-4136-b381-818770187ebe-0
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.370
Scene.

9804b09c-7feb-482d-90c4-2ca8f2ae7776-0
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.283
The man is walking with the
animal still down the road, it

9804b09c-7feb-482d-90c4-2ca8f2ae7776-1
00:26:51.283 --> 00:26:53.800
looks like in this futuristic
city.

93b2f279-ecb9-4435-bc36-2b19cb6a2292-0
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.060
He is.

975d8088-f5c1-4451-a09c-5c290aae6620-0
00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.860
Purchasing something and he
comes across an older.

f81edf95-dc30-4247-9481-db6c068b96ac-0
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:06.332
Gentlemen and older woman with
looks like a fish animal. He's

f81edf95-dc30-4247-9481-db6c068b96ac-1
00:27:06.332 --> 00:27:11.646
walking down the street and he's
trying. He opens a book and he's

f81edf95-dc30-4247-9481-db6c068b96ac-2
00:27:11.646 --> 00:27:13.660
trying to point to bread.

a14854d2-d386-4819-b140-7d02b516e490-0
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.601
It looks like he's trying to buy
something, something to eat, and

a14854d2-d386-4819-b140-7d02b516e490-1
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:21.660
this animal that's with him is
trying to help him as well.

dd931941-b9be-4785-ac3b-e540afc3ab9f-0
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.989
He's looking through this book,
trying to explain to people what

dd931941-b9be-4785-ac3b-e540afc3ab9f-1
00:27:25.989 --> 00:27:26.600
he may want.

4da70795-4a35-4f34-8dd6-fcd3908b9550-0
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.720
He finds an older gentleman and
a young boy.

22a440ad-ce80-4d3b-bfcd-0a97a3606bbb-0
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.886
And they're trying to sell him
and or give him what looks like

22a440ad-ce80-4d3b-bfcd-0a97a3606bbb-1
00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:40.010
an onion with kind of a tail on
it.

17fe85b0-a151-42a7-b992-64665f16a37e-0
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.959
And he keeps pointing to his
book that shows the picture of

17fe85b0-a151-42a7-b992-64665f16a37e-1
00:27:43.959 --> 00:27:46.675
of bread. The gentleman looks
like they're inside of the

17fe85b0-a151-42a7-b992-64665f16a37e-2
00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:49.487
store. The gentleman in the
store keeps trying to give him

17fe85b0-a151-42a7-b992-64665f16a37e-3
00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:51.870
something else that looks like
another vegetable.

81303818-806c-4850-98c9-8bae73eb2c30-0
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.586
The young boy is holding the big
basket with a smile on his face

81303818-806c-4850-98c9-8bae73eb2c30-1
00:27:56.586 --> 00:28:00.162
and that this man and young boy
are smiling and look like

81303818-806c-4850-98c9-8bae73eb2c30-2
00:28:00.162 --> 00:28:01.210
they're friendly.

bf397732-f79b-4da0-a152-74628d8dc586-0
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.550
people trying to help and
understand this man.

cdd014d4-67b2-411a-8537-0654b3e3aa84-0
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.819
They keep pulling different
things out at different food,

cdd014d4-67b2-411a-8537-0654b3e3aa84-1
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:18.425
different vegetables, different
animals that I've never seen

cdd014d4-67b2-411a-8537-0654b3e3aa84-2
00:28:18.425 --> 00:28:22.728
before. They look like root
vegetables. The boys holding

cdd014d4-67b2-411a-8537-0654b3e3aa84-3
00:28:22.728 --> 00:28:27.636
what looks like a almost like an
acorn but is as large as he is.

cdd014d4-67b2-411a-8537-0654b3e3aa84-4
00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:32.242
He's hugging it there. It looks
like sea animals, a snake, a

cdd014d4-67b2-411a-8537-0654b3e3aa84-5
00:28:32.242 --> 00:28:32.619
fish.

d020aac9-b28b-4842-ac1e-d78561a4d3ea-0
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.720
Another onion that they pull out
trying to.

bf2c4cf7-e6ee-4ba5-abc9-34d6ee334d03-0
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.232
To offer this these foods to
this man that is still wearing

bf2c4cf7-e6ee-4ba5-abc9-34d6ee334d03-1
00:28:41.232 --> 00:28:45.057
his suit and top hat. He takes a
bite of one of them and looks

bf2c4cf7-e6ee-4ba5-abc9-34d6ee334d03-2
00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:48.821
curious and they try and feed
the the animal that is with the

bf2c4cf7-e6ee-4ba5-abc9-34d6ee334d03-3
00:28:48.821 --> 00:28:49.550
man as well.

e4c619a2-f1da-44e6-9905-f6a7728ebf42-0
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.670
And give him a basket full of
food.

de9dd3c4-bf64-4238-ad20-422ed6a8e9b7-0
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.652
And they hugged the man, and the
little boy is telling his

de9dd3c4-bf64-4238-ad20-422ed6a8e9b7-1
00:28:58.652 --> 00:29:02.441
father, the store owner, which I
imagine a secret. The man hugs

de9dd3c4-bf64-4238-ad20-422ed6a8e9b7-2
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:05.459
the other man and gives him a
basket full of food.

c626246c-49f4-4e0c-866a-8aec20d909e6-0
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:11.285
And the three of them are now
being shown walking along with

c626246c-49f4-4e0c-866a-8aec20d909e6-1
00:29:11.285 --> 00:29:16.169
the animal through a scene with
some ships and a big futuristic

c626246c-49f4-4e0c-866a-8aec20d909e6-2
00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:18.230
kind of castle behind them.

44ec7adc-0faf-4018-8c93-3572ab185a1c-0
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.685
The the little boy is holding
the basket of food with the

44ec7adc-0faf-4018-8c93-3572ab185a1c-1
00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:31.486
animal that's been walking with
the man. He motions for the the

44ec7adc-0faf-4018-8c93-3572ab185a1c-2
00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:35.288
man to come over. He comes over
and something comes out of this

44ec7adc-0faf-4018-8c93-3572ab185a1c-3
00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:38.911
kind of clay looking pot. It
looks like an animal with a big

44ec7adc-0faf-4018-8c93-3572ab185a1c-4
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:40.099
tail is hanging out.

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-0
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.638
Looks like the shop owner is is
calming. Demand the hat and suit

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-1
00:29:45.638 --> 00:29:49.171
down and they and all of a
sudden this animal that looks

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-2
00:29:49.171 --> 00:29:53.262
like a a cat slash owl comes out
of the clay pot. The little boys

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-3
00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:57.167
holding this animal and smiling
and hugging it and introducing

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-4
00:29:57.167 --> 00:30:00.761
it to the man with the hat. The
father and the the two is

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-5
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.294
pointing and laughing and
smiling as the two animals the

69cebb05-6273-48a3-af33-4760f941ca32-6
00:30:04.294 --> 00:30:06.650
cat looking one and the other
animal.

d2bddbd3-e0dc-4ded-b3b3-44be60d14898-0
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.310
With the manner our meeting and
look like, they start playing.

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-0
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.633
 The man the both
of the men are speaking and look

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-1
00:30:16.633 --> 00:30:19.875
like they're discussing
something in more detail. The

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-2
00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:23.418
man with the hat starts drawing
a home and a pathway and a

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-3
00:30:23.418 --> 00:30:27.081
roadway. Maybe he's trying to
get home and trying to explain

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-4
00:30:27.081 --> 00:30:30.504
to the shop owner. The shop
owner seems confused that he

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-5
00:30:30.504 --> 00:30:34.227
doesn't know what he's saying
and almost there's a scene that

b4eac8a7-02f6-4b20-bd64-8e84f732fd95-6
00:30:34.227 --> 00:30:37.110
shows his eyes are almost full
of fire or fear. #END_arrival_4

7bc5ba93-945c-4824-a05d-565fed47ffef-0
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.280
Very interesting choice.

c1298df3-78fc-4e3d-8388-a273604732c9-0
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.920
Yes, let's see.

f1991be9-9868-4020-aaed-2f899ac946dd-0
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.790
OK, Next is a complex scene.

cbdcbb5a-5209-4146-a7d2-5fd011d9a67f-0
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:17.150


8f491f98-37b1-4190-bf86-a72584b1a8c2-0
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.270
Are we?

2b9f4452-85b3-4fe6-b60b-e62963f64f32-0
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.940
So this one's just a scene.

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-0
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.206
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
so this scene is located at the

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-1
00:31:32.206 --> 00:31:35.817
zoo and it looks like there are
lots of people and lots of

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-2
00:31:35.817 --> 00:31:39.857
animals. Some animals are behind
gates and glass and some animals

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-3
00:31:39.857 --> 00:31:43.530
look like they're trying to
escape. We have a rhino that is

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-4
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.142
running through the crowd.
People look fearful and are are

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-5
00:31:47.142 --> 00:31:51.182
scrambling and running away from
him. He looks quite happy though

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-6
00:31:51.182 --> 00:31:54.854
as he feels free and there are
multiple lions and lion Cubs

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-7
00:31:54.854 --> 00:31:58.160
that are looking down at the
people and some kids are

79c47f01-0310-451a-9cf9-bf20896b16b5-8
00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.650
jumping.

b2aede3e-c065-4e25-b981-1e6c2529490b-0
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.861
Over the glass railing of
protection into the lion, nest

b2aede3e-c065-4e25-b981-1e6c2529490b-1
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:03.370
or den.

b1edd4d7-81db-45ba-91ea-4179325c3b1d-0
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:10.123
The Lions look very content and
are happy to see children, maybe

b1edd4d7-81db-45ba-91ea-4179325c3b1d-1
00:32:10.123 --> 00:32:15.853
hungry. There is a hippo in some
water. There are pink flamingos.

b1edd4d7-81db-45ba-91ea-4179325c3b1d-2
00:32:15.853 --> 00:32:21.150
There are multiple zebras and
birds and their habitat. There

b1edd4d7-81db-45ba-91ea-4179325c3b1d-3
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.710
are giraffes and antelope and
one scene.

dc1e2680-0933-4868-859b-85c2215256cb-0
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.906
That looks very content, and
there's an ice cream shop where

dc1e2680-0933-4868-859b-85c2215256cb-1
00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:31.430
people can get ice cream.

f8d76ad7-9775-4cb4-8d66-9fc11dfc4194-0
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.025
It looks like there are probably
four or five animal areas. The

f8d76ad7-9775-4cb4-8d66-9fc11dfc4194-1
00:32:37.025 --> 00:32:41.164
4th one that I've not mentioned
is the polar bear. Multiple

f8d76ad7-9775-4cb4-8d66-9fc11dfc4194-2
00:32:41.164 --> 00:32:42.820
layers with polar bears.

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-0
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.264
And in the top left corner of
the scene, there is an elephant

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-1
00:32:48.264 --> 00:32:52.169
in the top of the scene with
trees surrounding. There's

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-2
00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:56.354
animals climbing the trees.
There's a little play area with

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-3
00:32:56.354 --> 00:33:00.469
looks like there is ice and
water. I don't see any animals

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-4
00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:04.583
in that area in the center, but
there are Rangers with net

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-5
00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:08.698
trying to catch animals. And
there is a cafe and a shop in

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-6
00:33:08.698 --> 00:33:13.301
the back of the scene. There are
people everywhere, some it looks

2c309cb5-6f07-4c77-b95c-8a4f47acdf73-7
00:33:13.301 --> 00:33:13.789
hectic.

a305bb75-2291-4fea-b52f-76dc5919077e-0
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.670
Some look excited to see the
animals and some look.

903db814-766b-4235-bb20-df0b6c5433e2-0
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.051
Bored just standing there, but
it's a hectic scene and lots of

903db814-766b-4235-bb20-df0b6c5433e2-1
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:23.110
lots of people and children
around.

cd736737-9f98-4ca8-9668-50f752a26582-0
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.090

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:32.630
OK.

7a923367-999f-487a-979f-99c924bb8eac-0
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:40.542
If you want to take a 3-4 minute
break, we can do so now. It's up

7a923367-999f-487a-979f-99c924bb8eac-1
00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:43.740
to you. If you don't mind, yeah,
OK.

102f79a0-ec1a-4b07-819a-0055249523ff-0
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.540
Way back in the second.

79512b8b-988d-44e6-991d-c79c15480a52-0
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.830
{Next, we have a story.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.800
I'll share my.

04f2eece-2b4f-4ce8-bda0-084194822fc2-0

Screen.

OK.

c0567681-d53f-447d-b1ca-f2bdbbcdc13f-0
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.080
So, same thing as before, let
me know when you'd like me to

c0567681-d53f-447d-b1ca-f2bdbbcdc13f-1
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.415
flip the pages. OK, I said.
#START_flowerman This is the

c0567681-d53f-447d-b1ca-f2bdbbcdc13f-2
00:38:57.415 --> 00:39:02.125
scene from a sketch of a city,
and it looks dark and grim. The

c0567681-d53f-447d-b1ca-f2bdbbcdc13f-3
00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:06.536
sky is like a dark purple. All
the buildings are black and

c0567681-d53f-447d-b1ca-f2bdbbcdc13f-4
00:39:06.536 --> 00:39:06.910
Gray.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.407
It looks like a car is falling
into a ravine. There was a

afe7b86a-4ff8-4509-bc8a-d1b92124a549-1
00:39:12.407 --> 00:39:16.191
bridge with light poles and
there was an individual walking

afe7b86a-4ff8-4509-bc8a-d1b92124a549-2
00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:20.164
across the bridge with an maybe
an amp dog or an animal by its

00:39:20.164 --> 00:39:20.480
side.

10538784-1752-4e48-87d1-671d7f6c4aba-0
00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.550
Umm.

5c8ae870-3233-4de7-a1b5-1464feaa0db9-0
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.192
That smokestacks in the
background there is a tree with

5c8ae870-3233-4de7-a1b5-1464feaa0db9-1
00:39:27.192 --> 00:39:31.153
no leaves. It looks like a kind
of a a scary scene and certainly

5c8ae870-3233-4de7-a1b5-1464feaa0db9-2
00:39:31.153 --> 00:39:32.190
not full of life.

42337d75-e1b0-4cc3-b399-a54376f50aea-0
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:39.006
There's a gas station and a bar,
an old what looks like an old

42337d75-e1b0-4cc3-b399-a54376f50aea-1
00:39:39.006 --> 00:39:44.442
carnival tent, and a carousel
that looks like it may be out of

42337d75-e1b0-4cc3-b399-a54376f50aea-2
00:39:44.442 --> 00:39:44.960
order.

019ece75-fe2b-484b-ac88-a2490b99c1ab-0
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.089
There's a large ravine in front
of the city, in front of the

019ece75-fe2b-484b-ac88-a2490b99c1ab-1
00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:54.030
building, and go ahead and flip
the page.

9ee040fe-7fa7-4a24-bc75-fae4d965783f-0
00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.860
Uh, this individual that was
walking across the.

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-0
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.261
Bridge is walking through the
city now it looks like again,

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-1
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:08.201
it's still a dark scene. It's at
night time, maybe at sunset. The

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-2
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:11.843
the street lamps are on. It
looks like cobble streets. There

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-3
00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:15.305
are multiple buildings with
residential units that people

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-4
00:40:15.305 --> 00:40:19.066
are living on. The second and
third stories. There's not a lot

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-5
00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:22.648
of people around, although there
are. There are some people

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-6
00:40:22.648 --> 00:40:26.289
walking the streets. There's
someone on a balcony. There are

30d309ab-9052-429b-8281-5f5ec0bf7488-7
00:40:26.289 --> 00:40:30.110
some families or individuals you
can see inside of their homes.

2c7ad95b-0ce2-4b72-933e-6550fe873923-0
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.870
There is a.

5a10a1e6-2a0e-4516-a705-53e0cf206f2a-0
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.450
What would have been a fountain
in the center of the square of

5a10a1e6-2a0e-4516-a705-53e0cf206f2a-1
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:40.494
the city. But there is no water
in the fountain. Again, it looks

5a10a1e6-2a0e-4516-a705-53e0cf206f2a-2
00:40:40.494 --> 00:40:42.610
like a dark and a dark sad
scene.

d197e325-3c70-40c5-94a1-462122d47fb4-0
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:56.766
This gentleman is wearing that
is walking still is wearing a

d197e325-3c70-40c5-94a1-462122d47fb4-1
00:40:56.766 --> 00:41:00.913
like a tan coat and a blue hat
and he's walking through the

d197e325-3c70-40c5-94a1-462122d47fb4-2
00:41:00.913 --> 00:41:05.060
city again. It looks like a lot
of the windows are open and

d197e325-3c70-40c5-94a1-462122d47fb4-3
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.240
people are in their homes living
their lives.

42b21925-a477-4f8e-965b-1dc8b0c5ae1e-0
00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.621
All of the homes are two to
three stories, and they have

42b21925-a477-4f8e-965b-1dc8b0c5ae1e-1
00:41:14.621 --> 00:41:18.560
windows or shutters that are
open to the elements. And there

42b21925-a477-4f8e-965b-1dc8b0c5ae1e-2
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.758
are some people standing on the
street, some people sitting near

42b21925-a477-4f8e-965b-1dc8b0c5ae1e-3
00:41:22.758 --> 00:41:26.310
the fountains, but the fountains
don't have any water.

ec60efaa-44c5-4051-a861-d2468f6f804a-0
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.244
The street lights are the only
things that are on. Everything

ec60efaa-44c5-4051-a861-d2468f6f804a-1
00:41:30.244 --> 00:41:31.450
else seems dim and dark.

3f347dc8-d4e8-45ff-9922-914eb1107931-0
00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:37.890
The gentleman is walking to what
looks like the only small little

3f347dc8-d4e8-45ff-9922-914eb1107931-1
00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.960
house in this game there are.

b350e0a5-03f8-4c6f-b691-fc86cee164e4-0
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.092
8 tall buildings, two to three
stories that look like they're

b350e0a5-03f8-4c6f-b691-fc86cee164e4-1
00:41:45.092 --> 00:41:49.007
all residential buildings, but
there is one small house that is

b350e0a5-03f8-4c6f-b691-fc86cee164e4-2
00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:52.738
a single story with a single
door that he's standing outside

b350e0a5-03f8-4c6f-b691-fc86cee164e4-3
00:41:52.738 --> 00:41:55.980
of the entrance with a little
picket fence and some.

a75bfdcb-5dcf-4a3d-857f-c8cf2c3046f2-0
00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.770
Someone looks like it's dying
landscaping and there is a for

a75bfdcb-5dcf-4a3d-857f-c8cf2c3046f2-1
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.090
sale sign in the front yard of
this little house.

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-0
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.801
The next scene looks very
similar to the previous scene,

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-1
00:42:10.801 --> 00:42:14.128
although this little house is
now in color where everything

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-2
00:42:14.128 --> 00:42:17.345
else is still in black and
white. It looks like it's more

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-3
00:42:17.345 --> 00:42:20.395
daytime, there's more people
walking around. There's a

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-4
00:42:20.395 --> 00:42:23.501
gentleman with a broken leg.
There's a that is riding a

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-5
00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:26.773
wheelchair down the road.
There's a gentleman on a scooter

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-6
00:42:26.773 --> 00:42:30.100
bike. There is a woman walking.
There are children playing.

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-7
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.317
Looks like one of the little
children are a number of the

e544c6d5-d0b1-4ceb-99dc-745c07852def-8
00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:36.090
children are going to school
with the backpack on

9e29685c-06e0-4786-a0b4-8c1f88cf6fb4-0
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:36.500


086f0175-ce01-4ea3-8138-c4acbe98d35d-0
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.849
There are still people in their
homes and you can see that

086f0175-ce01-4ea3-8138-c4acbe98d35d-1
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:44.230
they're living their lives.
There's a mother and a child and

086f0175-ce01-4ea3-8138-c4acbe98d35d-2
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.840
a daughter.

c1b2a79b-48cf-4ec1-b3df-de0b79999f78-0
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:50.333
Walking down the street there
are multiple people walking and

c1b2a79b-48cf-4ec1-b3df-de0b79999f78-1
00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:52.660
or standing outside the
building.

a6ce3352-bb80-44ed-be8a-03aa958056e0-0
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.666
That gentleman looks like he has
now purchased a home. He's

a6ce3352-bb80-44ed-be8a-03aa958056e0-1
00:42:56.666 --> 00:42:59.715
mowing the lawn. The grass is
green. He's replacing the

a6ce3352-bb80-44ed-be8a-03aa958056e0-2
00:42:59.715 --> 00:43:02.872
shutters. There's a purple
rooftop now and the tree looks

a6ce3352-bb80-44ed-be8a-03aa958056e0-3
00:43:02.872 --> 00:43:05.594
to have some color. It looks
like he's doing some

a6ce3352-bb80-44ed-be8a-03aa958056e0-4
00:43:05.594 --> 00:43:07.010
improvements to the house.

3fbfa83a-ce0c-44af-95fd-c69be4704a76-0
00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.325
Has a little stone walkway and a
fence still around this little

3fbfa83a-ce0c-44af-95fd-c69be4704a76-1
00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:13.580
home. Single story home.

e2c56541-9c42-4a11-a0f6-daa66ca4500f-0
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:24.148
The next scene is very similar.
He continues to work on the

e2c56541-9c42-4a11-a0f6-daa66ca4500f-1
00:43:24.148 --> 00:43:27.948
House. The house is the only
thing in color. Everything else

e2c56541-9c42-4a11-a0f6-daa66ca4500f-2
00:43:27.948 --> 00:43:31.562
is still in black and white.
There are less people on the

e2c56541-9c42-4a11-a0f6-daa66ca4500f-3
00:43:31.562 --> 00:43:35.425
road right now, but there is
still someone riding the scooter

e2c56541-9c42-4a11-a0f6-daa66ca4500f-4
00:43:35.425 --> 00:43:39.474
and someone some children around
the fountain there looks like a

e2c56541-9c42-4a11-a0f6-daa66ca4500f-5
00:43:39.474 --> 00:43:43.400
gentleman walking with one. It
looks like an ice cream cooler.

5fea1185-4091-4687-976d-0188668373ab-0
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:51.515
There is a milkman delivering.
There's a painter sitting on a

5fea1185-4091-4687-976d-0188668373ab-1
00:43:51.515 --> 00:43:55.973
stoop nearby. Everything is
still black and white. The

5fea1185-4091-4687-976d-0188668373ab-2
00:43:55.973 --> 00:44:01.160

green grass and an orange and
red tree in the backyard.

c3941c8f-b26a-4ed5-b184-c9c58d41c139-0
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.494
There is more color to the scene
now. Same scene, but there's

c3941c8f-b26a-4ed5-b184-c9c58d41c139-1
00:44:16.494 --> 00:44:17.900
more color and aliveness.

9019b720-8b48-46aa-8e2c-7f62b34c7f32-0
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.728
The home to the two-story
residential home now is showing

9019b720-8b48-46aa-8e2c-7f62b34c7f32-1
00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:26.330
red shutters and some light and
color and the people's homes.

145049a0-11ad-4910-af23-6af416db2c7b-0
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.837
People are a little bit more
active. There's the people are

145049a0-11ad-4910-af23-6af416db2c7b-1
00:44:30.837 --> 00:44:34.200
now the individuals and they're
humans. They're now colored.

f846ff59-0a75-486f-b339-3f69c402bae0-0
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.057
There are kids playing in the
street outside of the of this

f846ff59-0a75-486f-b339-3f69c402bae0-1
00:44:39.057 --> 00:44:40.040
gentlemen's home.

240724b7-311a-48ff-9d21-a4d648520ca0-0
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.774
There are people sitting in the
gentleman and two gentlemen

240724b7-311a-48ff-9d21-a4d648520ca0-1
00:44:44.774 --> 00:44:46.180
sitting in the fountain.

40ccde0e-e521-42da-819a-6967f3605cbf-0
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.630
Umm.

914863d0-6bf4-412e-befc-0af792946859-0
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.662
Movers and shakers truck out
front of the building next door

914863d0-6bf4-412e-befc-0af792946859-1
00:44:53.662 --> 00:44:57.353
to this gentlemen's house. It
looks like somebody is either

914863d0-6bf4-412e-befc-0af792946859-2
00:44:57.353 --> 00:44:58.830
moving in or moving out.

3a1ee91b-03eb-495c-b43c-295440db6802-0
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.938
You can still see activities
through all of the windows and

3a1ee91b-03eb-495c-b43c-295440db6802-1
00:45:02.938 --> 00:45:05.390
or shutters in the homes and the
residential homes.

65e0b5a6-b156-445b-9667-b73012c56871-0
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.692
But there is more color to the
scene, more activity to the

65e0b5a6-b156-445b-9667-b73012c56871-1
00:45:09.692 --> 00:45:13.404
scene, as some of the buildings
now are showing colors to their

65e0b5a6-b156-445b-9667-b73012c56871-2
00:45:13.404 --> 00:45:16.130
facade and the brick and the
rooftops as well.

4b99985f-f4e1-4b92-a4ba-cc31960dd26f-0
00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.809
The next picture is the same
scene, but everything is

4b99985f-f4e1-4b92-a4ba-cc31960dd26f-1
00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:26.220
colored. Now it looks alive

00:47:39.076 --> 00:47:42.392
different viewpoint of this city

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.860
The night sky looks like it's
it's probably around sunset.

already purchased the building

92a4f8a2-fa93-4a37-87f9-8644fc93ea73-3
00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:42.455

dropping off when they walk in.

1cd83df4-499a-4082-abe3-7851a059e8e1-3
00:51:35.452 --> 00:51:38.730
It looks like a handful of kids
are playing tug of war.

3e5da55c-c8fe-496c-b431-909f45348a57-0
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.127
With one of those ropes there
are there flags, colorful flags

3e5da55c-c8fe-496c-b431-909f45348a57-1
00:51:45.127 --> 00:51:49.505
and lanterns hanging from the
trees, from the tables, and from

3e5da55c-c8fe-496c-b431-909f45348a57-2
00:51:49.505 --> 00:51:50.200
the fence.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:57.909
Their costumes that go anywhere
from Elvis Presley to docks to

14c54819-2145-443a-b1f4-37675a59eb8e-1
00:51:57.909 --> 00:51:59.900
sports to football to Ninja.

38c906b3-c293-4897-8d98-2096dde28db6-0
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:06.594
Caveman superheroes piglets,
pigs looks like there is a

38c906b3-c293-4897-8d98-2096dde28db6-1
00:52:06.594 --> 00:52:12.473
pinata at one of the scenes some
of the kids are trying to open

38c906b3-c293-4897-8d98-2096dde28db6-2
00:52:12.473 --> 00:52:13.760
using a stick.

1542ba49-6074-46a7-9087-20f734c1c555-0
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.807
Kids are playing swords and and
fighters in one of the scenes as

1542ba49-6074-46a7-9087-20f734c1c555-1
00:52:19.807 --> 00:52:20.150
well.

70bf1dcd-82ea-4470-ab2b-2469024caa54-0
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.100
It looks like it's a great
party.

aba5d6f6-b1a3-44bc-8388-81fcfcf71150-0
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.940
But quite chaotic. #END_birthday_party_fun

48f41c07-5250-4d75-8142-92ee003b87dc-0
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:37.659
OK. Let me see what's next. Is
this what you're looking for?

48f41c07-5250-4d75-8142-92ee003b87dc-1
00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:38.480
Yeah, OK.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.320
Next is another complex scene.

77df382b-45ec-4c44-93df-504f66e6c5aa-0
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.030
OK, there we go.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:06.830
So same thing.

237f41e9-4615-4036-a3d2-39e81e695548-0
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:12.450
#START_make_a_splash OK, so this
scene is at a water park. It's a

237f41e9-4615-4036-a3d2-39e81e695548-1
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.740
crowded scene with.

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-0
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:19.142
100 people or so. It's at a
water park. There is a big local

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-1
00:53:19.142 --> 00:53:23.407
pool in the middle and there are
multiple water slides that dump

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-2
00:53:23.407 --> 00:53:27.738
into the pool. There are lots of
people in the pool just floating

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-3
00:53:27.738 --> 00:53:32.069
around and playing and swimming.
There are Lily pads in the pool.

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-4
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:35.874
They're the water snakes that
people are playing over and

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-5
00:53:35.874 --> 00:53:39.680
they're a little mushrooms in
the pool that that kids can

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-6
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.223
climb on. There's a little
floating frog as well, and

76d6c3b4-cd5c-457a-93f9-1649011a8d09-7
00:53:43.223 --> 00:53:44.929
people are in inner tubes.

2be7ed02-985b-4db4-9f64-145076bf3196-0
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.308
Within the pool itself there are
rainbow slides coming from the

2be7ed02-985b-4db4-9f64-145076bf3196-1
00:53:49.308 --> 00:53:53.452
right side, red, orange, yellow,
green, blue and magenta that

2be7ed02-985b-4db4-9f64-145076bf3196-2
00:53:53.452 --> 00:53:57.730
multiple kids are fighting down
and landing inside the pool. On

2be7ed02-985b-4db4-9f64-145076bf3196-3
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:01.808
the other side of the scene, on
the left side, there are the

2be7ed02-985b-4db4-9f64-145076bf3196-4
00:54:01.808 --> 00:54:05.952
tube water slides and there's a
green 1, yellow one and a red

2be7ed02-985b-4db4-9f64-145076bf3196-5
00:54:05.952 --> 00:54:06.220
one.

091d9675-b3e9-48a8-ae63-74a8d61988c7-0
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:11.692
It looks like there's a floating
river on the the left bottom of

091d9675-b3e9-48a8-ae63-74a8d61988c7-1
00:54:11.692 --> 00:54:15.610
the scene. Everybody's an inner
tube floating down this river.

9cfb6369-94a8-4524-aaac-088d7361dd8f-0
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:20.174
And some people are laying out
in the grass sunbathing. There

9cfb6369-94a8-4524-aaac-088d7361dd8f-1
00:54:20.174 --> 00:54:24.142
is a lifeguard on duty, multiple
lifeguards. One is sitting in a

9cfb6369-94a8-4524-aaac-088d7361dd8f-2
00:54:24.142 --> 00:54:28.049
chair by the tube slides and and
two that I can see are walking

9cfb6369-94a8-4524-aaac-088d7361dd8f-3
00:54:28.049 --> 00:54:29.820
around by the Floating River.

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-0
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.698
Um, or the lazy river. There's also a ship,

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-1
00:54:34.698 --> 00:54:38.702
looks like a pirate ship that is
also in the in the big pool.

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-2
00:54:38.702 --> 00:54:42.384
There is a large slide that
multiple kids can go down at

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-3
00:54:42.384 --> 00:54:46.452
once from the ship into the big
pool. Kids are playing on this

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-4
00:54:46.452 --> 00:54:50.457
ship as well. The tube sites are
on a mountain that have some

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-5
00:54:50.457 --> 00:54:54.525
palm trees and kids can climb up
to to take the the slide down

333e8ef2-58bd-4eb9-9ad4-29e761c115d2-6
00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:55.430 
into the pool. #END_make_a_splash

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:09.080
And next is another complex
scene.

c68aa6ba-e38a-4246-a632-38ee13651c9c-0
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:29.120

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.930
#START_deep_sea_divers Wow, so
this is a deep sea diving scene.

2d368159-73ff-42ce-aadd-7d1d3c41c85d-0
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:38.237
That 2/3 of the scene is
underwater and 1/3 of the scene

2d368159-73ff-42ce-aadd-7d1d3c41c85d-1
00:55:38.237 --> 00:55:43.142
is above water. Above water you
have multiple ships and boats.

2d368159-73ff-42ce-aadd-7d1d3c41c85d-2
00:55:43.142 --> 00:55:48.047
There's probably 12 or 14 boats
that are full of of men either

2d368159-73ff-42ce-aadd-7d1d3c41c85d-3
00:55:48.047 --> 00:55:48.670
fishing.

3dcf56da-5c43-40d7-9c18-83f26211a897-0
00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.750
All of them are fishing. There
are some and we're seeing

3dcf56da-5c43-40d7-9c18-83f26211a897-1
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.373
craters or some sort of rock
formations that that people have

3dcf56da-5c43-40d7-9c18-83f26211a897-2
00:55:57.373 --> 00:56:00.996
been climbing on and are fishing
off of those as well. One of

3dcf56da-5c43-40d7-9c18-83f26211a897-3
00:56:00.996 --> 00:56:04.560
them looks like they have a
number of mermaid sitting on the

3dcf56da-5c43-40d7-9c18-83f26211a897-4
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:04.970
crater.

119d5dc3-4138-4e56-ad71-8371b99edda2-0
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:10.089
But the majority of the boats
are all different. Colors are

119d5dc3-4138-4e56-ad71-8371b99edda2-1
00:56:10.089 --> 00:56:13.827
red and white striped, blue and
white striped, green and white

00:56:13.827 --> 00:56:17.446
striped, and most everybody's
fishing from them. Some people

119d5dc3-4138-4e56-ad71-8371b99edda2-3
00:56:17.446 --> 00:56:21.066
are swimming in the water. It
looks like there's a shark and

119d5dc3-4138-4e56-ad71-8371b99edda2-4
00:56:21.066 --> 00:56:24.685
some sort of very large bird
with its beak open to swallow a

119d5dc3-4138-4e56-ad71-8371b99edda2-5
00:56:24.685 --> 00:56:25.159
ship up.

180d4cbf-3908-44cf-b955-503f2c9463c5-0
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:31.776
And underneath the scene, under
the water, there are lots of of

180d4cbf-3908-44cf-b955-503f2c9463c5-1
00:56:31.776 --> 00:56:36.821
sea life and animals. There are
people swimming and scuba

180d4cbf-3908-44cf-b955-503f2c9463c5-2
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:41.866
diving, there are mermaids,
there are sharks and fish and

180d4cbf-3908-44cf-b955-503f2c9463c5-3
00:56:41.866 --> 00:56:42.910
sea turtles.

And.

284f4404-389f-4715-8175-7577d1278d18-0
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:52.045
Very hectic and very busy. It
looks like there's a little a

284f4404-389f-4715-8175-7577d1278d18-1
00:56:52.045 --> 00:56:57.114
green sneeze, sea snake, very
large fish and a shark. Lots of

284f4404-389f-4715-8175-7577d1278d18-2
00:56:57.114 --> 00:57:02.265
humans are swimming underneath
the water as well, not just the

284f4404-389f-4715-8175-7577d1278d18-3
00:57:02.265 --> 00:57:02.920
animals.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.746
But it's very busy. There's a
green octopus on the bottom of

3d861533-74f5-467f-af56-e6d936e61621-1
00:57:07.746 --> 00:57:07.960

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:13.811
Of the
ocean floor and lots of coral,

00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:18.478
red and yellow and green coral.
And as well the scene is very,

dd341a25-3313-497e-bfb5-0ae4e18d598e-2
00:57:18.478 --> 00:57:21.220

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.480
It's let me see what's next.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:36.320

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.263
#START_arrival_3 OK, so this
scene is taking place in what

152d2178-a7d3-43c4-a37a-bafeaed23e62-1
00:58:15.263 --> 00:58:19.319
looks like the early 1900s. By
the attire, there was a young

152d2178-a7d3-43c4-a37a-bafeaed23e62-2
00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:23.708
boy, probably in his early teens
or adolescents, that's holding a

152d2178-a7d3-43c4-a37a-bafeaed23e62-3
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:25.770
sign, but a different language.

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.460
There is another.

00:58:34.144 --> 00:58:38.469
street. Another scene is a
gentleman that is pushing around

b6a83423-6812-49c8-8104-0db4b6aa7269-2
00:58:38.469 --> 00:58:43.154
a 4 wheeled cart with the smoke
stack on it. There's also a what

00:58:43.154 --> 00:58:47.479
looks like almost like a lizard
or a dinosaur reptile and a

b6a83423-6812-49c8-8104-0db4b6aa7269-4
00:58:47.479 --> 00:58:49.570
basket attached to that cart.

A man and a woman are holding
what looks like very large eggs,

6f1444ae-b412-47df-ac6c-0cdcf19e1752-1
00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:01.550
you know, 10 pounds plus and
putting them into a wooden box.

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.250
Umm.

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:09.903
There is another scene with a
man shaving another man's beard

e5e45f92-6ba6-4c6a-8eb4-84c81ca24cdd-1
00:59:09.903 --> 00:59:14.530
and a small boy sitting next to
him with some snail type animals

e5e45f92-6ba6-4c6a-8eb4-84c81ca24cdd-2
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:19.086
on the ground. One is very large
the size of the boys torso and

e5e45f92-6ba6-4c6a-8eb4-84c81ca24cdd-3
00:59:19.086 --> 00:59:23.500
the other three snails are much
smaller the size of his foot.

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:28.080
And there there's a man showing
playing some sort of horn

a1f758db-1381-432d-995e-9594fe924490-1
00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.887
instrument with another playing
the violin, and they're both

a1f758db-1381-432d-995e-9594fe924490-2
00:59:31.887 --> 00:59:35.569
looking at the same sheet of
music, with some birds on the

a1f758db-1381-432d-995e-9594fe924490-3
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:37.130
five birds on the ground.

00e74427-e290-4b14-bcf3-781fb46a00b4-0
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.298
There is a scene of of women
looking like they're reading a

00e74427-e290-4b14-bcf3-781fb46a00b4-1
00:59:42.298 --> 00:59:45.761
newspaper or reading something
and discussing something with a

00e74427-e290-4b14-bcf3-781fb46a00b4-2
00:59:45.761 --> 00:59:48.950
large poster with a different
language in the background.

4719b9e0-fafc-4247-bba4-15628c45b8df-0
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:54.132
And the man that we discussed
earlier in the scene with the

4719b9e0-fafc-4247-bba4-15628c45b8df-1
00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:58.557
three piece suit and Black Hat
is now carrying a suitcase and

4719b9e0-fafc-4247-bba4-15628c45b8df-2
00:59:58.557 --> 01:00:02.340
looks like he is pondering or
looking for something.

20a41ffc-752a-413d-8e76-83700835f1e5-0
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.470
Umm.

ebd7e7d6-6bd5-4cc6-89c0-b7646ffa52ef-0
01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.950
The man picks up a.

f664468d-6888-4d1c-a5b8-a4738a63617e-0
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:17.853
Either a stopwatch or a compass
and is looking for something. He

f664468d-6888-4d1c-a5b8-a4738a63617e-1
01:00:17.853 --> 01:00:21.806
looks at it. What would be their
clock or something on a tall

f664468d-6888-4d1c-a5b8-a4738a63617e-2
01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:25.631
tower for direction. He is
walking down the road within the

f664468d-6888-4d1c-a5b8-a4738a63617e-3
01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:29.839
scene itself and all of a sudden
it looks like snow is coming out

f664468d-6888-4d1c-a5b8-a4738a63617e-4
01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:33.919
of the sky, but there are light.
They are lit, so he is curious

f664468d-6888-4d1c-a5b8-a4738a63617e-5
01:00:33.919 --> 01:00:36.470
to see what that is. His hat
blows off.

b7b7c380-6f92-40e7-b9ea-a602b8868eb0-0
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:41.833
He goes to pick up his hat and
and notices some arrows. He is

b7b7c380-6f92-40e7-b9ea-a602b8868eb0-1
01:00:41.833 --> 01:00:46.057
inquisitive. To understand what
these arrows mean, he opens a

b7b7c380-6f92-40e7-b9ea-a602b8868eb0-2
01:00:46.057 --> 01:00:48.850
book that looks in a different
language.

f8573213-3197-41d1-96f7-4ecde4cdae9c-0
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.628
A gentleman with another
gentleman walks by with a almost

f8573213-3197-41d1-96f7-4ecde4cdae9c-1
01:00:53.628 --> 01:00:56.740
like a turban on his hat on his
head with a white.

84c783bb-c1df-46df-924f-1b260e74f22a-0
01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.434
Shirt and white pants and he's
talking to the man back and

84c783bb-c1df-46df-924f-1b260e74f22a-1
01:01:02.434 --> 01:01:06.925
forth. The man is trying to show
him the picture of a bed and the

84c783bb-c1df-46df-924f-1b260e74f22a-2
01:01:06.925 --> 01:01:11.144
gentleman with the turban says
the point his finger like he's

84c783bb-c1df-46df-924f-1b260e74f22a-3
01:01:11.144 --> 01:01:15.227
saying aha and start showing him
the way and the man is now

84c783bb-c1df-46df-924f-1b260e74f22a-4
01:01:15.227 --> 01:01:16.180
following him.

7235e34b-986f-4a83-a3be-88c7a6984d8c-0
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.212
And then he
ended. The Black cat is

7235e34b-986f-4a83-a3be-88c7a6984d8c-1
01:01:19.212 --> 01:01:22.197
following him, and there is the
gentleman in the white outfit is

7235e34b-986f-4a83-a3be-88c7a6984d8c-2
01:01:22.197 --> 01:01:24.310
now carrying some sort of animal
on his back. #END_arrival_3 

2263a420-132e-410e-a6bb-72f0b4e1cc2c-0
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:39.868
Such an interesting story to
choose. Yeah, they some of them

2263a420-132e-410e-a6bb-72f0b4e1cc2c-1
01:01:39.868 --> 01:01:40.840
are quite.

84be61a6-2ad4-4dc8-ae20-abd61590c11d-0
01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:45.010
Strange. Ohh next is actually
another story.

3d71eeb7-486d-47ac-8431-9e943326c8cb-0
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:55.300
Yeah, OK.

e4be7898-7eb6-4268-a78e-f12725443eb1-0
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.960
OK, so this one's another
story.

2549d77d-432b-4229-a05f-871f00fb9d6b-0
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.630
This is so strange. OK.

7f2b0507-1ae4-4061-bdda-f43efe07df9c-0
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.113
#START_wanderer A gentleman
that's wearing some sort of

7f2b0507-1ae4-4061-bdda-f43efe07df9c-1
01:02:25.113 --> 01:02:29.111
costume with a horn on his head
is trying to fold a very large

7f2b0507-1ae4-4061-bdda-f43efe07df9c-2
01:02:29.111 --> 01:02:29.810
paper that.

ab3da60b-70e8-4be5-a6a5-8f6851c076b9-0
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.834
The man looks very tall so he's
probably 6 foot. The paper is

ab3da60b-70e8-4be5-a6a5-8f6851c076b9-1
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:39.081
probably 10 feet by 20 feet and
there is another boy and or man

ab3da60b-70e8-4be5-a6a5-8f6851c076b9-2
01:02:39.081 --> 01:02:43.461
in a striped shirt and jeans. He
is not in costume that is trying

ab3da60b-70e8-4be5-a6a5-8f6851c076b9-3
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:47.708
to help him fold this paper into
what looks like a boat for his

ab3da60b-70e8-4be5-a6a5-8f6851c076b9-4
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:48.040
ship.

1a38cea7-66dd-4dde-8acb-72086ba09730-0
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:54.259
The next scene is actually a
boat or a ship, but it looks

1a38cea7-66dd-4dde-8acb-72086ba09730-1
01:02:54.259 --> 01:02:54.850
like a.

5aadb939-4746-4095-9a20-6166f3efdb4a-0
01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.645
Pirates boat almost, but it has
a building on. It looks like a

5aadb939-4746-4095-9a20-6166f3efdb4a-1
01:03:00.645 --> 01:03:04.190
brick building and it has almost
a submarine type

6c5c9096-9d9c-4a84-8edd-e2dc29841cc7-0
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:10.380
Bulb, and that's connected to
the bottom of this ship. It

6c5c9096-9d9c-4a84-8edd-e2dc29841cc7-1
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:10.970
doesn't.

f0980e3c-4a7e-485a-b6af-3129320d5289-0
01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.668
Maybe in the water, but there's
no color. It's this. This is

f0980e3c-4a7e-485a-b6af-3129320d5289-1
01:03:14.668 --> 01:03:16.000
only showing in black and white.

2d9b8f2b-b7e0-4194-9c18-e1a2ea79e4e7-0
01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:31.758
The next scene it looks like the
paper ship is now sailing in the

2d9b8f2b-b7e0-4194-9c18-e1a2ea79e4e7-1
01:03:31.758 --> 01:03:37.293
ocean. Very vast ocean with no
other boats and there is a large

2d9b8f2b-b7e0-4194-9c18-e1a2ea79e4e7-2
01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:42.742
white Pelican or some sort of
bird that is flying with a small

2d9b8f2b-b7e0-4194-9c18-e1a2ea79e4e7-3
01:03:42.742 --> 01:03:48.018
family of 246810 birds behind
him or underneath him that are

2d9b8f2b-b7e0-4194-9c18-e1a2ea79e4e7-4
01:03:48.018 --> 01:03:50.440
all flying across the ocean.

92d95402-223b-447f-9be4-6acaf0c72147-0
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.440
Still black and white, no color.

65ba46d1-30bc-4f53-865a-4159f81556fe-0
01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.001
That white paper ship is sailing
in the ocean and it looks like

65ba46d1-30bc-4f53-865a-4159f81556fe-1
01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:07.355
some sea turtles and a couple of
birds have found it or trying to

65ba46d1-30bc-4f53-865a-4159f81556fe-2
01:04:07.355 --> 01:04:11.050
either explore and or climb up
on the boat if they can.

f7ae8c21-1d0d-4717-88b9-377f09ac489d-0
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.111
And the boat continues. By
itself, it doesn't look like

f7ae8c21-1d0d-4717-88b9-377f09ac489d-1
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:21.017
anybody's on board. And as it's
sailing down the ocean there is

f7ae8c21-1d0d-4717-88b9-377f09ac489d-2
01:04:21.017 --> 01:04:22.090
a large black.

b60f3709-4eb8-4aa8-9cfc-4ccfcdff2011-0
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.724
Object with which looks like
some sort of sea animal with a

b60f3709-4eb8-4aa8-9cfc-4ccfcdff2011-1
01:04:26.724 --> 01:04:30.750
fin sticking straight up that is
probably 20 times 30 times the

b60f3709-4eb8-4aa8-9cfc-4ccfcdff2011-2
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:31.820
size of the boat.

49f7caa2-cf05-486d-a3a3-9eafbb5d14c3-0
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.800
That animal that came up with a
whale, now the boat is floating

49f7caa2-cf05-486d-a3a3-9eafbb5d14c3-1
01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.980
on the whales fin and the whale
is under the water and the boat

49f7caa2-cf05-486d-a3a3-9eafbb5d14c3-2
01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.998
is now sitting above the water
resting on the whale fin. It's

49f7caa2-cf05-486d-a3a3-9eafbb5d14c3-3
01:04:52.998 --> 01:04:58.098
showing sea life underneath the
water with coral reef and fish

49f7caa2-cf05-486d-a3a3-9eafbb5d14c3-4
01:04:58.098 --> 01:05:02.954
and and animals and lots of
schools of fish floating around

49f7caa2-cf05-486d-a3a3-9eafbb5d14c3-5
01:05:02.954 --> 01:05:05.140
and living under the water.

e602c2fc-af74-42f2-b4a3-4e503df41754-0
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:13.501
The next scene is of under the
water as well with lots of fish.

e602c2fc-af74-42f2-b4a3-4e503df41754-1
01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:16.771
Everything is black and white.
You've got coral reef striped

e602c2fc-af74-42f2-b4a3-4e503df41754-2
01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:17.040
fish.

5e02ce50-4594-4509-93f6-5a853beb8c9e-0
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:24.103
Seaweed, larger fish, baby fish,
schools of fish, all floating

5e02ce50-4594-4509-93f6-5a853beb8c9e-1
01:05:24.103 --> 01:05:25.450
under the water.

0fb820ad-b737-41c1-b0a2-ab330f724478-0
01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.675
The majority of the scene is 90%
of the scene is underwater and

0fb820ad-b737-41c1-b0a2-ab330f724478-1
01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.733
the the boat seems to be
floating on the top of the water

0fb820ad-b737-41c1-b0a2-ab330f724478-2
01:05:32.733 --> 01:05:33.050
again.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:35.450
The whale is now gone.

17970c91-fd69-4a9f-b811-b55e06fc59f6-0
01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:40.770
Um.

558c5671-6066-45f3-9bdb-c2951ffa297b-0
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:46.435
The boat, the paper boat is
still floating above the water.

558c5671-6066-45f3-9bdb-c2951ffa297b-1
01:05:46.435 --> 01:05:51.420
There are two fish under the
sea. Would that look like they

558c5671-6066-45f3-9bdb-c2951ffa297b-2
01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:56.073
have fish heads but normal
bodies I see a hand that are

558c5671-6066-45f3-9bdb-c2951ffa297b-3
01:05:56.073 --> 01:06:01.473
kissing under the ocean, lots of
coral and fish and schools with

558c5671-6066-45f3-9bdb-c2951ffa297b-4
01:06:01.473 --> 01:06:06.542
fish as well. The second scene
is showing similar human body

558c5671-6066-45f3-9bdb-c2951ffa297b-5
01:06:06.542 --> 01:06:07.290
and hand.

c62bdc84-c8ce-4d7c-9b7d-21a5dd0d53c1-0
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:13.786
But a fish head and then there's
now a fishing pole hanging off

c62bdc84-c8ce-4d7c-9b7d-21a5dd0d53c1-1
01:06:13.786 --> 01:06:18.596
of the paper, the paper boat,
and it looks like it is caught a

c62bdc84-c8ce-4d7c-9b7d-21a5dd0d53c1-2
01:06:18.596 --> 01:06:20.200
fish under the water.

a713f1d6-2510-4294-af1c-655ef8050d4d-0
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.576
The the paper boat is still
floating on top of the water and

a713f1d6-2510-4294-af1c-655ef8050d4d-1
01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:36.617
there is coral reef underneath
and fish functioning. It looks

a713f1d6-2510-4294-af1c-655ef8050d4d-2
01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:39.160
like 1 fish has come out of the
water.

a1a530b1-0e11-4933-9ff9-f1d4607bbec8-0
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:44.181
And another seahorse is sitting
on top of that fish that is

a1a530b1-0e11-4933-9ff9-f1d4607bbec8-1
01:06:44.181 --> 01:06:48.714
looking into the paper boat. The
seahorse looks to have gone into

a1a530b1-0e11-4933-9ff9-f1d4607bbec8-2
01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:53.110
the paper boat and is now riding
on the boat. And there is some

a1a530b1-0e11-4933-9ff9-f1d4607bbec8-3
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:57.231
sea life. It looks like a sea
snake that is now climbed its

a1a530b1-0e11-4933-9ff9-f1d4607bbec8-4
01:06:57.231 --> 01:07:01.696
way from the bottom of the ocean
floor up into the paper boat as

a1a530b1-0e11-4933-9ff9-f1d4607bbec8-5
01:07:01.696 --> 01:07:02.040
well.

fff1e2ef-6548-4c36-ae23-86470b51689d-0
01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.886
The scene now shows above the
water, so you're not seeing

fff1e2ef-6548-4c36-ae23-86470b51689d-1
01:07:12.886 --> 01:07:16.697
anything under the water. It
shows the boat sailing on the

fff1e2ef-6548-4c36-ae23-86470b51689d-2
01:07:16.697 --> 01:07:20.701
water and it shows a very large,
almost looks like coral, but

fff1e2ef-6548-4c36-ae23-86470b51689d-3
01:07:20.701 --> 01:07:24.318
some sort of tree like coral.
Above the water there are

fff1e2ef-6548-4c36-ae23-86470b51689d-4
01:07:24.318 --> 01:07:24.900
Pelicans.

fc98193a-343b-404e-abc8-387b5a5c9800-0
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:30.516
Um, resting and or sitting on
this coral, the Pelicans.

fc98193a-343b-404e-abc8-387b5a5c9800-1
01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:35.735
They're probably 30 or 40 of the
pelic white Pelicans. It looks

fc98193a-343b-404e-abc8-387b5a5c9800-2
01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:40.465
like either eating and or
arresting on this coral that is

fc98193a-343b-404e-abc8-387b5a5c9800-3
01:07:40.465 --> 01:07:41.770
very, very tall.

926672a5-0f5e-4162-a848-68e2924abdd5-0
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:52.806
The next scene shows the boat
floating down the water

926672a5-0f5e-4162-a848-68e2924abdd5-1
01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:57.751
underneath it you can see sea
life fish, coral reef and some

926672a5-0f5e-4162-a848-68e2924abdd5-2
01:07:57.751 --> 01:08:02.776
of this coral and or sea life
have are are based on the ocean

926672a5-0f5e-4162-a848-68e2924abdd5-3
01:08:02.776 --> 01:08:07.720
floor or the waters floor and
come above the water where the

926672a5-0f5e-4162-a848-68e2924abdd5-4
01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:12.988
birds are nesting and or resting
within the trees that they have

926672a5-0f5e-4162-a848-68e2924abdd5-5
01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:16.150
that they have grown. So the
scene is.

ac29efd2-05ae-4d10-9575-a247b6e60c6e-0
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.670
Split half underwater and half
above water.

9368eab7-d017-4986-a071-715b45da444b-0
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:28.168
The seahorse is now riding in
the boat that is going through

9368eab7-d017-4986-a071-715b45da444b-1
01:08:28.168 --> 01:08:33.310
what looks like a almost cave
like experience because of the.

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-0
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:39.472
The plants have overgrown and
kind of connected and created a

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-1
01:08:39.472 --> 01:08:43.581
cave, but it looks like there
are some animals that are living

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-2
01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:47.298
in here and their eyes are
glowing. They look like large

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-3
01:08:47.298 --> 01:08:51.536
sea horse, at least their faces
do, but we can't see their body.

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-4
01:08:51.536 --> 01:08:55.710
They're hidden under the plant
like substances and they're also

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-5
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:59.753
some birds in the trees viewing
the the floating boat and the

bd22b8ba-1826-4fea-aac9-6e803f02c239-6
01:08:59.753 --> 01:09:00.340
seahorse.

00e906f6-bf76-4947-9908-7fac5d24c75b-0
01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.130
The next scene shows.

be258250-f0c0-4f9e-af39-23975a0300ce-0
01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:12.097
The boat floating through again,
the same sort of plant like tree

be258250-f0c0-4f9e-af39-23975a0300ce-1
01:09:12.097 --> 01:09:16.991
canopy. Underneath the water you
can see another seahorse with

be258250-f0c0-4f9e-af39-23975a0300ce-2
01:09:16.991 --> 01:09:17.379
arms.

7e6481a0-40bd-4871-859a-9071f29b4de3-0
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.100
That looks to be doing
something. I can't see exactly

7e6481a0-40bd-4871-859a-9071f29b4de3-1
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:26.233
what they're doing, but he's
he's riding a lobster. There's

7e6481a0-40bd-4871-859a-9071f29b4de3-2
01:09:26.233 --> 01:09:30.160

fish floating around and

7e6481a0-40bd-4871-859a-9071f29b4de3-3
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.431
swimming around as well. The
seahorse in the next scene looks

7e6481a0-40bd-4871-859a-9071f29b4de3-4
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:38.358
to jump off of the boat as he
sees some similar seahorse

7e6481a0-40bd-4871-859a-9071f29b4de3-5
01:09:38.358 --> 01:09:38.909
friends.

7c35e925-3aeb-4392-8a99-5999b0d1d502-0
01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:40.470
In the water.

172c30bc-1448-4ca7-b321-afc5ad7be8c5-0

its body and its head is outside
of the water and it looks like a

172c30bc-1448-4ca7-b321-afc5ad7be8c5-2
01:09:54.422 --> 01:09:58.443

01:09:58.443 --> 01:10:02.599
remainder of his body is under
the water. He is a white belly

172c30bc-1448-4ca7-b321-afc5ad7be8c5-4
01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:05.950
and a black head and a black
back and black tail.

e52d74a5-0000-49e7-b6dd-666b5dd898dc-0
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:11.784
The next scene shows a different
type of the animal that looks

e52d74a5-0000-49e7-b6dd-666b5dd898dc-1
01:10:11.784 --> 01:10:16.100
kind of like a seahorse, but
with a more rounded whale.

979f0fe7-d123-42b8-9811-3008562e2126-0

01:10:24.536 --> 01:10:30.590
sinking ships. Looks like and
this particular animal has.

054fcad0-ef1c-4b2a-8bf5-8c36433200a4-0
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.158
What looks like kind of coral as
a as a tail in the back of its

054fcad0-ef1c-4b2a-8bf5-8c36433200a4-1
01:10:37.158 --> 01:10:37.540

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:57.313
They some of these animals have
arms and legs. It looks like

db7e9e12-b6c6-4177-8afe-ea1194466880-1
01:10:57.313 --> 01:11:01.613

alligator.

bf0c0b9c-a1eb-4704-acdc-15cea37f8f79-0

something growing out of it.

0c9568e9-6ee7-4eda-8bcd-45023c3e13b0-1

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:29.610
A tail, a fin. It's a kind of a
mixture of multiple animals.

7f9eb18b-00f7-4ad5-8535-bf296dba1cf4-0
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:33.030

d8697429-8d90-4a66-a1fe-940410bb133b-1
01:11:49.989 --> 01:11:54.641
of dark fish with their eyes lit
up at night. It's a starry sky.

d8697429-8d90-4a66-a1fe-940410bb133b-2
01:11:54.641 --> 01:11:59.221
There is a Crescent moon in the
background. You can see kind of

d8697429-8d90-4a66-a1fe-940410bb133b-3
01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:03.230

01:12:16.488 --> 01:12:19.952
multiple layers of circles
around the boat. There are

a454f5ff-03cc-46f3-801a-e0de3ae71645-3
01:12:19.952 --> 01:12:20.530
probably.

5b71782b-4ea8-41d3-b17d-c159092811f5-0
01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:27.544
100 maybe? Or 80 fish in the
scene that are all staring and

5b71782b-4ea8-41d3-b17d-c159092811f5-1
01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:29.280

01:12:37.964 --> 01:12:42.408
the fish have still followed,
but it's a night sky. 90% or 80%

20fc4c07-0eb5-4c2e-809e-81c44c879601-2
01:12:42.408 --> 01:12:46.781

01:12:46.781 --> 01:12:51.295
is just the the water. The sky
looks like there is some sort of

20fc4c07-0eb5-4c2e-809e-81c44c879601-4
01:12:51.295 --> 01:12:55.810
curtain that is shimmering with

curtain almost in circular

51bc5792-df9e-4d1d-8cde-829d6f4b7158-1
01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:03.640
motion.

2ab04957-8bfd-40d5-b2bf-027894d308ce-0
01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.945
The boat keeps floating down the
the water and comes against a

2ab04957-8bfd-40d5-b2bf-027894d308ce-1
01:13:08.945 --> 01:13:12.959
what looks like a iceberg or
some sort of strong structure

2ab04957-8bfd-40d5-b2bf-027894d308ce-2
01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:17.177
that stands out of the water. It
has a flat top, however, but

2ab04957-8bfd-40d5-b2bf-027894d308ce-3
01:13:17.177 --> 01:13:21.395
it's quite tall and 10 or 12
times the size of the the little

2ab04957-8bfd-40d5-b2bf-027894d308ce-4
01:13:21.395 --> 01:13:23.299
boat and the water floating.

c310b9f6-af05-4c0b-a770-4463b1f6af8a-0
01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:30.616
The boat keeps floating and
keeps going across some

c310b9f6-af05-4c0b-a770-4463b1f6af8a-1
01:13:30.616 --> 01:13:34.660
structures that have formed
outside and on top of the water.

daac0710-382f-4ccb-aa45-76496aab6699-0
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:39.192
And there are archways that the
boat is floating through. One

daac0710-382f-4ccb-aa45-76496aab6699-1
01:13:39.192 --> 01:13:42.995
looks like there are some trees
with snow on top of it, and it

daac0710-382f-4ccb-aa45-76496aab6699-2
01:13:42.995 --> 01:13:46.677
looks like there's some ice caps
that the boat is navigating

daac0710-382f-4ccb-aa45-76496aab6699-3
01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:47.160
through.

d2de0338-e632-45dd-8b5f-87b240edb012-0
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.930
And under some archways.

0ee1bfb3-bf0c-4622-8548-1af1ff929bfd-0
01:13:56.630 --> 01:14:00.852
The the paper boat continues to
keep floating, and it looks like

0ee1bfb3-bf0c-4622-8548-1af1ff929bfd-1
01:14:00.852 --> 01:14:04.620
it's floating across some
additional icebergs that almost

0ee1bfb3-bf0c-4622-8548-1af1ff929bfd-2
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:05.270
look like.

ec4b4b5e-3349-45c9-9b65-36b1a6b6cea9-0
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.280
Like feet.

e1910bcf-45d3-45be-b869-85e2cb180dc8-0
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:10.480
And.

f73a5b65-7d55-498b-985f-a5777754da71-0
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.410
The next scene.

dc969501-b25d-45d8-b83f-81ee1cbbafbc-0
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.377
It looks like someone that was
scuba diving has now come out of

dc969501-b25d-45d8-b83f-81ee1cbbafbc-1
01:14:19.377 --> 01:14:22.100
the water and brought a number
of.

9594a354-530e-43fc-9ea0-26874a147ffb-0
01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:29.802
Lights with them it and there is
light shining on the boat and

9594a354-530e-43fc-9ea0-26874a147ffb-1
01:14:29.802 --> 01:14:32.270
lifted the boat off of the
water.

9102cb39-142e-4619-b172-45f76cdbef8e-0
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.530
Looks like a human esque person.

fdfe75b6-ecee-4ae9-8076-3f00435c6eb6-0
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:45.131
And the boat is now continuing
to go down. You can see the

fdfe75b6-ecee-4ae9-8076-3f00435c6eb6-1
01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:48.523
light of the scuba diver out of
the water, but now it is

fdfe75b6-ecee-4ae9-8076-3f00435c6eb6-2
01:14:48.523 --> 01:14:50.130
floating near massive ship.

79f21c4e-47a7-4e9a-b22b-7b186f226839-0
01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.847
And and the ships have have
large anchors and birds flying

79f21c4e-47a7-4e9a-b22b-7b186f226839-1
01:14:54.847 --> 01:14:58.974
across. It reminds me of the
Titanic kind of a tanker ship. I

79f21c4e-47a7-4e9a-b22b-7b186f226839-2
01:14:58.974 --> 01:15:03.168
don't see any humans in this or
any people in this scene, just

79f21c4e-47a7-4e9a-b22b-7b186f226839-3
01:15:03.168 --> 01:15:06.430
ships and smokestacks coming out
of those ships.

eb4c4f29-35f9-4a39-9be6-4d9b18f554d3-0
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:14.610
The next scene is of.

9be22391-dc10-40f2-9ecf-6b7f09af874e-0
01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:20.525
A major oil or smokestack rig
out of the water. The boat is

9be22391-dc10-40f2-9ecf-6b7f09af874e-1
01:15:20.525 --> 01:15:24.804
floating and there looks like
all of these animals and or

9be22391-dc10-40f2-9ecf-6b7f09af874e-2
01:15:24.804 --> 01:15:29.377
birds are dying and they're all
falling from the sky into the

9be22391-dc10-40f2-9ecf-6b7f09af874e-3
01:15:29.377 --> 01:15:29.820
water.

8eb8f4f9-ed63-4ada-9a6a-1a62eb8cd8f0-0
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.625
And you can see some fish that
are dead as well and they're

8eb8f4f9-ed63-4ada-9a6a-1a62eb8cd8f0-1
01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:34.640
polluting the water.

d24a0f4d-b905-45aa-a5e5-1e61c96edd48-0
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:40.383
This the smokestack or structure
is standing with pylon outside

d24a0f4d-b905-45aa-a5e5-1e61c96edd48-1
01:15:40.383 --> 01:15:41.630
of the water with.

2b67f374-e173-4253-8930-f9ef69f4967a-0
01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:47.360
I would imagine concrete pylons,
and there are six or seven

2b67f374-e173-4253-8930-f9ef69f4967a-1
01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.790
smokestacks on the structure
itself.

6a920c95-aa5e-407f-8ccd-03103a26212d-0
01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.670
Polluting the air.

cfdd8c40-af60-42e6-91c4-fef734309de5-0
01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:04.360
Now, from the boat itself, there
are.

086c19f7-219d-4f46-81c1-d6d50479131f-0
01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:10.363
Humans are somebody is shooting
down at the water with some

086c19f7-219d-4f46-81c1-d6d50479131f-1
01:16:10.363 --> 01:16:12.820
either guns or sharp objects.

eb6a9762-e406-4618-9446-3a15b535d83e-0
01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.170
Umm.

0de9e058-106e-4532-80a3-801c1dc47b66-0
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:21.020
That that came and put a hole in
the paper boat.

370290ec-a054-4e7b-9ad3-7af108371ea0-0
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.070
The person that was scuba
diving.

8a1d2d13-ecb0-4aa0-a349-9e46f86889ae-0
01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.853
And it's coming to save or jump
on to that boat as he's getting

8a1d2d13-ecb0-4aa0-a349-9e46f86889ae-1
01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:32.060
attacked, he seems to have
gotten.

576e6a23-2381-4114-a624-6714d292d647-0
01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.812
On top of a rocket somehow or
some sort of ship, but it's now

576e6a23-2381-4114-a624-6714d292d647-1
01:16:36.812 --> 01:16:40.668
that ship has been hit so he
looks like he's about to jump

576e6a23-2381-4114-a624-6714d292d647-2
01:16:40.668 --> 01:16:44.590
into this boat that has a life
saving device in it as well.

a1af929f-d9e7-4d8d-aa18-ce2673bbb7d2-0
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:46.140
Raft.

45c74baa-995e-458b-9e72-f165a3136b81-0
01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.420
Inner tube, whatever it's
called.

b43c9cac-098b-4fcd-b658-1769680ffe0a-0
01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.093
And this individual is now
trying to get on as the waters

b43c9cac-098b-4fcd-b658-1769680ffe0a-1
01:16:57.093 --> 01:17:01.050
become choppy, trying to get on
to this paper boat.

986ff1bd-23d4-4571-9b8d-5a0c5f339aa6-0
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:03.130
And.

c3a7f460-c37d-4e4b-88d8-1e54112c322a-0
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.940
It's swimming towards it.

1230724e-bf7d-4052-a056-46ca34a11791-0
01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:11.232
The next scene shows what would
look like a ship, but it's

1230724e-bf7d-4052-a056-46ca34a11791-1
01:17:11.232 --> 01:17:15.940
really kind of a shell, like a
seashell large seashell with.

03f59b82-b44e-4f8d-844d-e2a0620b4ced-0
01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:21.190
The initial scene of the man
with some sort of Cape and

03f59b82-b44e-4f8d-844d-e2a0620b4ced-1
01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:25.025
costume, black costume on with
horns on his head, with some

03f59b82-b44e-4f8d-844d-e2a0620b4ced-2
01:17:25.025 --> 01:17:28.925
animals on the boat as well.
Everybody a horse and some sort

03f59b82-b44e-4f8d-844d-e2a0620b4ced-3
01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:32.697
of animal horse like with
antlers all looking at the paper

03f59b82-b44e-4f8d-844d-e2a0620b4ced-4
01:17:32.697 --> 01:17:35.830
boats heading that direction
with a kite behind.

fe0a30e1-ad27-4b53-b479-3eb7c0ac6a71-0
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:39.080
This is so strange.

c27818de-750c-4785-be05-231f9e81b059-0
01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:47.903
And the the the gentleman and
the costume and the Black Cape

c27818de-750c-4785-be05-231f9e81b059-1
01:17:47.903 --> 01:17:53.026
and Horns has now picked up the
boat and turned it into a paper

c27818de-750c-4785-be05-231f9e81b059-2
01:17:53.026 --> 01:17:57.909
airplane, and there the kite has
burned or opened up, and so

c27818de-750c-4785-be05-231f9e81b059-3
01:17:57.909 --> 01:17:58.709
there are.

e25dc777-82e2-481b-94e8-5a019710677e-0
01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:04.233
People or kids on the kite
hanging on. They're still animal

e25dc777-82e2-481b-94e8-5a019710677e-1
01:18:04.233 --> 01:18:08.072
on this ship. Slash seashell and
they're heading towards a

e25dc777-82e2-481b-94e8-5a019710677e-2
01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:11.260
massive wave. The seas are now
incredibly rocky.

b30316cb-5e86-4d34-86f5-5bf47a56916b-0
01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.712
The next scene shows the boat
floating a huge storm that is in

b30316cb-5e86-4d34-86f5-5bf47a56916b-1
01:18:19.712 --> 01:18:23.946
coming in. The waters are choppy
but are flat and there is a

b30316cb-5e86-4d34-86f5-5bf47a56916b-2
01:18:23.946 --> 01:18:28.318
light at large lightning bolt
that that strikes the water. And

b30316cb-5e86-4d34-86f5-5bf47a56916b-3
01:18:28.318 --> 01:18:32.760
the next scene is the the boat
looks like it's a paper airplane

b30316cb-5e86-4d34-86f5-5bf47a56916b-4
01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.299
flying on top of the water not
touching the water.

4ccfcdef-3a0e-41d0-9a2f-f0814d7eeb4f-0
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:47.049
The paper boat is back in the
water and is now going through

4ccfcdef-3a0e-41d0-9a2f-f0814d7eeb4f-1
01:18:47.049 --> 01:18:48.800
what looks like a water snake.

98212ef5-8151-4cce-b8d4-2093c7a13785-0
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:52.892
Multiple water snakes or one
water snake that is in and out

98212ef5-8151-4cce-b8d4-2093c7a13785-1
01:18:52.892 --> 01:18:56.067
of the water and is going
underneath the little archways

98212ef5-8151-4cce-b8d4-2093c7a13785-2
01:18:56.067 --> 01:18:57.070
that the snake is.

19953eea-3842-488a-b6f5-3d39095bb5c5-0
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:58.420
Is.

829a786e-b8ed-4fa6-9000-3095d7970342-0
01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:03.438
Creating and the snake is now
picked up the paper boat with

829a786e-b8ed-4fa6-9000-3095d7970342-1
01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:03.650
it.

beabb747-579e-4e48-b1b7-a99ef5f0f60a-0
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:06.170
Mouth.

63e0e744-0a21-4b8b-80f3-21390d6cb61e-0
01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:15.170
The paper boat is now floating
through the water snake.

2eac3804-dfc9-49d6-8ffe-b4947e8d6c44-0
01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:19.761
And the water thing just looks
to be looking at the boat as

2eac3804-dfc9-49d6-8ffe-b4947e8d6c44-1
01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:20.620
it's floating away.

63d00bb3-fd62-4c87-b982-eb716c679e79-0
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:29.897
The boat now comes across looks
like similar whale dolphin type

63d00bb3-fd62-4c87-b982-eb716c679e79-1
01:19:29.897 --> 01:19:33.885
Unicorn whales that are snouting
water into the boat which is

63d00bb3-fd62-4c87-b982-eb716c679e79-2
01:19:33.885 --> 01:19:35.880
filling the boat up with water.

491308ba-efae-422f-9702-f86bd48eeb31-0
01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:40.405
And it looks like it's heading
towards a beach where there's

01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:43.957
another animal, but with two
legs that is standing on the

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.721
The next scene is Jellyfish,
which means the boat is likely

c9cb1f98-f656-4f01-b88a-7c8cb6437205-1
01:19:57.721 --> 01:20:01.413

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:47.674
There are some animals climbing
aboard and they look like

01:20:47.674 --> 01:20:52.106
centipedes almost climbing
aboard the paper ship that is at

4eadb830-3291-4565-a98e-1a89ecb09daa-2
01:20:52.106 --> 01:20:56.686
the bottom looks like at the
bottom of the ocean and there is

4eadb830-3291-4565-a98e-1a89ecb09daa-3
01:20:56.686 --> 01:21:01.340

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:24.036
Light floating, floating light,
and they're heading to a larger

01:23:24.036 --> 01:23:27.612
lighthouse that is on a
structure that is one large and

c76d8525-0fb4-4fe7-8f0e-8a44aeaebb87-2
01:23:27.612 --> 01:23:31.443
a second figure next to it. Some
striped building with some

01:23:31.443 --> 01:23:32.720
windows on the side.

86779078-f50b-4bfe-86bc-4aa902cf232a-0
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.460
In some boats and some ships in
the background.

88d1e92b-5cfe-4b6e-89fc-a8e7124938eb-0
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:46.937
The next scene is shown. This
paper boat is floating. It's a

88d1e92b-5cfe-4b6e-89fc-a8e7124938eb-1
01:23:46.937 --> 01:23:49.350
bridge. A bridge to some sort
of.

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-0
01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.840
Events they I have no idea. This
bridges is not connected to. I

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-1
01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.961
can't see what's on either side.
It's a big round structure. It

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-2
01:23:59.961 --> 01:24:03.952
looks like almost scaffolding
that is connected to the bottom

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-3
01:24:03.952 --> 01:24:07.944
of the water and sits above the
water. There are ships in the

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-4
01:24:07.944 --> 01:24:11.936
scene and through this space
event space, some sort of active

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-5
01:24:11.936 --> 01:24:15.992
space. There is a bridge that
looks like it's going somewhere,

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-6
01:24:15.992 --> 01:24:19.855
maybe to land, but we don't see
the land in the background.

28b3581b-3674-4c54-8a78-98f903e7fa87-7
01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:22.560
There are a number of ships in
the scene.

7dcf84f6-6260-43e5-957e-2e1fac86a590-0
01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:26.340
As well as the floating paper
boat.

289e0395-ba4d-4b26-9010-c1900bd91742-0
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:33.250
The paper boat is.

270a0389-5778-47cf-b315-6c3e7ac1859a-0
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:39.290
Next to a very, very large
tanker.

8a2bbeab-466d-498d-94c9-82b8aa1831a0-0
01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:43.299
And it is floating on top of the
water, along with another

8a2bbeab-466d-498d-94c9-82b8aa1831a0-1
01:24:43.299 --> 01:24:46.390
smaller ship in sailboat.
There's also a submarine under

8a2bbeab-466d-498d-94c9-82b8aa1831a0-2
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:49.753
the water itself, and now you
can see land or some structures

8a2bbeab-466d-498d-94c9-82b8aa1831a0-3
01:24:49.753 --> 01:24:51.760
in the background behind the
tanker.

0f76a04c-858d-4a94-a289-576881a0e022-0
01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:02.620
There is a very large whale that
has come out of the water.

9cca8645-1988-4c84-997e-a5ccde0035d3-0
01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:12.330
People are standing on the ship
and are waving, looking out onto

9cca8645-1988-4c84-997e-a5ccde0035d3-1
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:13.200
the water.

e473c60e-f0d9-4090-be2d-bf726df2445d-0
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.405
These tankers are huge. The
whale is very very large and it

e473c60e-f0d9-4090-be2d-bf726df2445d-1
01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:22.483
looks like it's got some sort of
light or water structure and

e473c60e-f0d9-4090-be2d-bf726df2445d-2
01:25:22.483 --> 01:25:26.757
scuba gear that it's wearing as
well. But it also has looks like

e473c60e-f0d9-4090-be2d-bf726df2445d-3
01:25:26.757 --> 01:25:27.809
it has arms and.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.280
And legs.

104dd275-6571-4f6e-bb5c-4e27b6fa407f-0
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:40.142
The paper boat continues to sit
above the water and now it's

104dd275-6571-4f6e-bb5c-4e27b6fa407f-1
01:25:40.142 --> 01:25:44.725
showing more of a land scene.
Looks very industrialized with

104dd275-6571-4f6e-bb5c-4e27b6fa407f-2
01:25:44.725 --> 01:25:47.730
smokestacks and cranes that are
moving.

d1b4abb5-0f29-46e8-84e0-f4bbaca12841-0
01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:50.340
Containers.

6db9e0fe-377a-4417-8ccd-9e49c77ad125-0
01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.527
In the foreground there is a
little mini boat that is waving

6db9e0fe-377a-4417-8ccd-9e49c77ad125-1
01:25:55.527 --> 01:26:00.067
to somebody on land. Looks like
potentially bringing goods then

6db9e0fe-377a-4417-8ccd-9e49c77ad125-2
01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:02.550
maybe something similar to a
port.

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-0
01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.691
And the next scene, it looks
like it's taking a almost

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-1
01:26:06.691 --> 01:26:10.129
seahorse looking structure out
of the water, but it doesn't

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-2
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:13.682
look like it really animal. It
looks like people can actually

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-3
01:26:13.682 --> 01:26:16.891
sit inside and maybe go
underneath the water to observe

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-4
01:26:16.891 --> 01:26:20.616
what's going on. It still looks
like an industrial area. More of

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-5
01:26:20.616 --> 01:26:23.996
the crane is lifting this
seahorse structure in and out of

ae15cdd2-adad-46a4-b976-41bbd2092205-6
01:26:23.996 --> 01:26:24.569
the water.

7ac6794e-d82c-4493-933b-7feec7aaf82e-0
01:26:31.230 --> 01:26:35.800
This boat, ship and Crane has
now captured the whale.

7a4e4db7-2b1a-479a-8b8d-5ab491ef5ecd-0
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.797
The paper boat is floating
nearby the structure, but the

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:42.800
whale is now.

e47abedd-14e9-4615-81c3-d0e8cda560c1-0
01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:48.110

net off of a crane.

c4eda136-cb92-4fa5-9bfb-d4da7a4a92b9-0
01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:52.557
There are some sort of flag on
this boat too I can't quite see.

c4eda136-cb92-4fa5-9bfb-d4da7a4a92b9-1
01:26:52.557 --> 01:26:55.704
It looks like it's got a fish or
some sort of sea animal on the

c4eda136-cb92-4fa5-9bfb-d4da7a4a92b9-2
01:26:55.704 --> 01:26:55.950
flag.

01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:01.220
There is a building.

c028428b-2403-4a51-b04c-5d684ade9150-0
01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:04.140
On land with the water.

01:27:07.410 --> 01:27:11.234
Oh, it's the ship. The ship has
structure. It looks like brick

920e48ce-8493-4b28-8a3c-cc61b341dde8-1
01:27:11.234 --> 01:27:14.270
structure. It says exploration
on the side of it.

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.818
Um, it's showing the scene of
the paper boat in front of this

836ed260-a243-48fb-bf51-fd2ea0e47c84-1
01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:22.739
ship. But this is more, it looks
more like a building, but it's

836ed260-a243-48fb-bf51-fd2ea0e47c84-2
01:27:22.739 --> 01:27:23.720

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.592
The ship side of it on the
backside looks more like a

0cf76008-ad3d-4411-a721-3bafaa62ac65-1
01:27:27.592 --> 01:27:28.180
normal ship.

e2df9c5c-625b-4674-b05f-e337cbf0b1c0-0
01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.999
This scene is now showing more
of a city but looks like water

e2df9c5c-625b-4674-b05f-e337cbf0b1c0-1
01:27:37.999 --> 01:27:40.610
and or river that's running
through it and.

8a730a9c-38a1-43ee-b64f-e7ae1b7c8a76-0
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:46.922
There is a lighthouse and some
buildings, more of a large city

8a730a9c-38a1-43ee-b64f-e7ae1b7c8a76-1
01:27:46.922 --> 01:27:48.170
and this boat.

a9f39b95-6df5-4c2e-9985-8e11411388ad-0
01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:52.601
Paper boat is floating through
the the river through the middle

a9f39b95-6df5-4c2e-9985-8e11411388ad-1
01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:53.290
of the city.

e6ed907a-0bc4-430b-8097-837c64faeade-0
01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:04.547
The boat continues to travel
through the river that their

e6ed907a-0bc4-430b-8097-837c64faeade-1
01:28:04.547 --> 01:28:09.323
arches archways with windows
multiple across that goes over

e6ed907a-0bc4-430b-8097-837c64faeade-2
01:28:09.323 --> 01:28:10.120
the river.

b3802b73-e8d5-4a27-9744-4e1b5c558d46-0
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.493
The boat is floating through. It
has sea life in the river, in

b3802b73-e8d5-4a27-9744-4e1b5c558d46-1
01:28:15.493 --> 01:28:19.619
the water, and it also has a
horse and the gentleman that was

b3802b73-e8d5-4a27-9744-4e1b5c558d46-2
01:28:19.619 --> 01:28:23.613
man that was wearing the Cape
and the horns. There's a cat,

b3802b73-e8d5-4a27-9744-4e1b5c558d46-3
01:28:23.613 --> 01:28:27.740

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:32.000
walking up from the river up the
stairs towards the Main Street

70fe1264-7a76-4034-917d-f4e79156edf9-0
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:41.360

down the river.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.870
The night sky with stars in the
background. It's going

b3ec5c57-8b05-4868-9abb-1730ac1df417-1
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:49.765
underneath a bridge with fish
popping out looking at it as

b3ec5c57-8b05-4868-9abb-1730ac1df417-2
01:28:49.765 --> 01:28:52.340
well as it's adjacent to the
submarine

efc53a0d-e44a-4cd1-99fa-041d6f2dc44a-0
01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:54.860
That's half in the water and
half out.

bdff9f42-87dc-4138-a544-077af694b878-0
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.726
The paper boat continues to
travel down and through the

bdff9f42-87dc-4138-a544-077af694b878-1
01:29:07.726 --> 01:29:12.090
water and looks there's a small
little structure home in the

bdff9f42-87dc-4138-a544-077af694b878-2
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.880
distance with a light shining
over it.

0463c0aa-be15-42bd-b3ab-c14a9de97175-0
01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.050
And the paper boat is floating.

06085ed1-29a9-4053-ba35-e792e991b91e-0
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:28.270
Now there's a ghost, there's
some sort of structure that or

06085ed1-29a9-4053-ba35-e792e991b91e-1
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:31.310
person that is appearing on the
boat.

03764117-54ae-41eb-8eca-413b0e589a17-0
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:32.560
And the boat

f9af6ed0-7072-49ae-a5d8-d048733f2431-0
01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:37.951
Takes this person
and or ghost to somewhere that

f9af6ed0-7072-49ae-a5d8-d048733f2431-1
01:29:37.951 --> 01:29:42.361
looks like stairs and the human
and or figure starts walking up

f9af6ed0-7072-49ae-a5d8-d048733f2431-2
01:29:42.361 --> 01:29:43.120
the stairs. #END_wanderer

a802dd65-c368-4f16-82a3-83dafdf33989-0
01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:51.940
Interesting.

56e6e630-d889-4e94-8a90-38d9e3ec218f-0
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.030
Yes.

dbcf97c9-10ce-44de-b5e5-592636859632-0
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.570
Can I ask how?

11b13330-6196-4c14-a7a8-16db3b082ba9-0
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.920
I'm just curious how that has
any.

9d477581-89ec-495a-b42d-1bcf3c386048-0
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:08.758
That is a very difficult scenes
to even follow. How can anyone

9d477581-89ec-495a-b42d-1bcf3c386048-1
01:30:08.758 --> 01:30:12.530
with aphasia do that? So we're
seeing like how?

f6cbf1c3-6592-4fc3-8749-e39504c27af0-0
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:16.700
Like we're seeing how people
describe them and if we have to

f6cbf1c3-6592-4fc3-8749-e39504c27af0-1
01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.891
like make any modifications. So
we're just like going through

f6cbf1c3-6592-4fc3-8749-e39504c27af0-2
01:30:19.891 --> 01:30:22.980
all that. So we're just seeing
how like these work for the.

053b3b81-8cc0-4f56-8513-a534ada69750-0
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.474
For our study, and then like
seeing what we'd have to modify

053b3b81-8cc0-4f56-8513-a534ada69750-1
01:30:29.474 --> 01:30:33.265
and if we'd have to make things
longer, shorter, modify the

053b3b81-8cc0-4f56-8513-a534ada69750-2
01:30:33.265 --> 01:30:37.310
pictures, if things have to be
zoomed in more, stuff like that.

013d9fec-41ff-494e-973a-96ae402de23d-0
01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.050
So I just.
