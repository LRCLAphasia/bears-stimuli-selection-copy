00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.740
Do I need to hang on?

c93cfb9c-f6b8-4696-af07-c7d00aa928e9-0
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.074
I've. I press continue. OK,

c93cfb9c-f6b8-4696-af07-c7d00aa928e9-1
00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:15.146
instructions for our graphic
novels. So you are going to look

c93cfb9c-f6b8-4696-af07-c7d00aa928e9-2
00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:19.021
at a series of pictures that
tell a story. Imagine you are

c93cfb9c-f6b8-4696-af07-c7d00aa928e9-3
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:22.831
telling the story to someone who
cannot see the pictures.

c93cfb9c-f6b8-4696-af07-c7d00aa928e9-4
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:26.903
Describe what you see and what
is happening as you go through

c93cfb9c-f6b8-4696-af07-c7d00aa928e9-5
00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:27.559
the story.

67f5b41e-d5f8-4f72-94c0-675b386ab55e-0
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.129
This story is about 30 pages
long and in terms of level of

67f5b41e-d5f8-4f72-94c0-675b386ab55e-1
00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.725
detail, please try to take
roughly 10 to 15 minutes to tell

67f5b41e-d5f8-4f72-94c0-675b386ab55e-2
00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.628
each story. So as you feel that
you're done describing 1 slide,

67f5b41e-d5f8-4f72-94c0-675b386ab55e-3
00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:47.531
you could tell me to move on and
I will continue the slide show

67f5b41e-d5f8-4f72-94c0-675b386ab55e-4
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.140
like flipping a page.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.360
And now I will share.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.700
The slideshow.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.093
Am I telling this story to
someone with aphasia, or to a

ea605b58-54ec-4f30-9245-76e21d30fd8a-1
00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:10.297
child, or to a doesn't it
matter? You're just telling the

ea605b58-54ec-4f30-9245-76e21d30fd8a-2
00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:11.240
story to me.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.560
And it's loading.

fee2d09c-7ffc-440b-9711-c57f36def53d-0
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.810
Slowly. Slowly.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.598
Just gonna X out of some of the
forms, that way it loads a

228ed9e4-694b-4f18-9603-dbd75369d928-1
00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:34.480
little fast.

86c5a950-5dd3-47a1-8967-689a9fb670b0-0
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210
tabs open at the moment as
well.

cb4ec482-acc4-4062-9e42-ff856fe7bf6e-0
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.530
Gonna try.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.890
Open.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.097
Maybe if I tried downloading
it, Yep, OK. If I download them

2305ef39-111d-4258-af2e-9ffadee6f3fb-1
00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:51.230
they work I think.

1c5b57a2-48fd-4107-a890-b6aa1b0639b8-0
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.227
OK, perfect. I found I've got
it. I'm going to share the

1c5b57a2-48fd-4107-a890-b6aa1b0639b8-1
00:01:57.227 --> 00:01:58.110
PowerPoint.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.290
And I am going to.

43daa979-06c9-4eae-9e45-17e812234aec-0
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.780
Make it my full screen.

d40b516f-2ddd-4469-9943-ae8f0ae488be-0
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.340
Slideshow play from start OK
so.

80c065b3-ca3d-4554-8ab1-4768b5872e31-0
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:34.790


d4883783-6957-47ca-802c-58abf243d8d4-0
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.282
You could describe just what you
see, and then when you're ready

d4883783-6957-47ca-802c-58abf243d8d4-1
00:02:44.282 --> 00:02:46.260
you could tell me when to move
on so.

c8fb51b4-b5b2-4b31-a144-b71d168b792c-0
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.350

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.390
So go you're saying it's OK
whenever, whenever you're ready,

a394837f-5aa7-43f5-8fe1-8c71707cd21b-1
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.420
you could start talking about
it.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.932
It could be a child, and I mean
it looks very strange. Creature

506471cd-0944-4c76-ab02-9a1856c0ef16-1
00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:07.450
with some sort of demon wearing
a unit or someone wearing a

d075ef55-d9c1-4671-b0b6-15b5f8cd955c-0
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.445
Wearing a Halloween costume and
they're either very small or

d075ef55-d9c1-4671-b0b6-15b5f8cd955c-1
00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:16.800
they've got a very large piece
of paper and they're doing an

d075ef55-d9c1-4671-b0b6-15b5f8cd955c-2
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.300
origami

69f1b1a4-fa08-4858-a776-faf5c681f2bf-0
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.436
Folding exercise that is either
a hat or it ends up with

69f1b1a4-fa08-4858-a776-faf5c681f2bf-1
00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.230
transpires that it's a.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.830
Boat like a like a a like like a
yacht made out of paper.

9bbb1302-681b-4bf8-a568-dbf693d6e4e0-0
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.870
And that unfolded a series of.

e14b3408-4dd9-40bd-920f-2851ce1ba38a-0
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.135
Scenarios from from from one
piece of paper, then it ends up

e14b3408-4dd9-40bd-920f-2851ce1ba38a-1
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:44.812
being felt in the shape of a
boat, and then we see that

e14b3408-4dd9-40bd-920f-2851ce1ba38a-2
00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:48.686
sailing in the distance on the
on a distant horizon, being

e14b3408-4dd9-40bd-920f-2851ce1ba38a-3
00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.000
followed by a giant.

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-0
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.185
Sailing ship, that's a bit with
with a, with a, with a with a

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-1
00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:59.854
submarine attached underneath it
under the water line. It's got a

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-2
00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:04.099
propeller, but it seems to be
wind powered as well and it's

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-3
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.555
got a sort of a castle on the
back end of the ship. It's a bit

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-4
00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:13.083
a bit fabulous and they they may
well be chasing the paper, the

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-5
00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:17.468
paper boat that has just been
made. I can't see any people on

b95ebc63-0ec6-4394-b427-a6521ebcf7cf-6
00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:18.529
the paper boat.

44fdc3d3-ad8a-49dd-b552-cb29707a0ab4-0
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.880
But.

c56c9d9e-3bf1-4b3b-91bc-820636273c8d-0
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.184
I don't see any people on the
big ship either. Yes I can.

c56c9d9e-3bf1-4b3b-91bc-820636273c8d-1
00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:27.750
Small people in the big ship
following the paper boat.

732d45ea-1390-495c-858d-234cb5ad0a1f-0
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.090
I think that's about all I can
say about it.

c68a9742-9c10-4ced-a35d-788e1d0a5500-0
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.780
Well, here we go.

0f412a6f-1ddc-4542-9d68-1c8f0298f36e-0
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.700
We have, we still have the paper
boat that floats on the sea, but

0f412a6f-1ddc-4542-9d68-1c8f0298f36e-1
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.760
nobody in it but they whole
flock of birds.

0c575fb6-77b9-4975-a344-c6541c78fc31-0
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.487
The larger one on the front is a
Gannett, it seems to be, and the

0c575fb6-77b9-4975-a344-c6541c78fc31-1
00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:54.803
ones behind it all could be,
could be terns, I don't know.

0c575fb6-77b9-4975-a344-c6541c78fc31-2
00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:57.290
And there's 12345678910 of
those.

1d8ac635-920b-4320-a0b0-690f4b40f641-0
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.596
And the boat may be following
the birds as they flow from fly

1d8ac635-920b-4320-a0b0-690f4b40f641-1
00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:07.531
from bottom left to top right of
the screen on an otherwise empty

1d8ac635-920b-4320-a0b0-690f4b40f641-2
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:07.980
ocean.

2528cb43-392d-4777-a89f-334952e3b28a-0
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.600
terns. I've got forked tails.
Here they are terns.

0204aba1-e5f6-4d68-a9da-87151b9bc756-0
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.270
{Ohh now.}

f2a1fb9a-1669-434c-9cfb-3ef2a28b06c9-0
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.456
Back to the paper boat and we
got to the birds sitting on the

f2a1fb9a-1669-434c-9cfb-3ef2a28b06c9-1
00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:28.897
edge of it, some flying above,
and there's nobody on the boat,

f2a1fb9a-1669-434c-9cfb-3ef2a28b06c9-2
00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:31.738
but there are two or two
turtles, Harlequin turtles

f2a1fb9a-1669-434c-9cfb-3ef2a28b06c9-3
00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:33.650
trying to, trying to climb
aboard.

4a08da78-3566-4aa8-871c-9e2d009a9136-0
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.250
And that's on the left hand
picture.

fcfe96c4-ded8-4d70-9d14-95203ebd2923-0
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.229
Three turtles, I apologize.
They're they're a bit, they're a

fcfe96c4-ded8-4d70-9d14-95203ebd2923-1
00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:42.500
bit.

7b9c034c-afaf-45f6-9f49-72b4cc6fc2b3-0
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.070
Artistic rather than, rather
than representative.

a1e62d62-bc14-4d8f-9569-5f18373ab83a-0
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.175
And the next screenshot again
shows this small paper boat. No

a1e62d62-bc14-4d8f-9569-5f18373ab83a-1
00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:52.620
turtles.

cc52a56b-e365-4263-b81c-ee8b09079490-0
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.003
And what is possibly a giant
whale is preaching alongside it

cc52a56b-e365-4263-b81c-ee8b09079490-1
00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:00.960
with lots of bubbles.

16269835-a752-461a-83c0-60359aa77a04-0
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.640
Again, turn the page next, the
next page of the book and it's.

cd4df9dc-e40d-4d09-8e77-6513926fc627-0
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.180
A double page as well we gotta.

66238b04-1475-4f7f-a7cc-62f151dc80fb-0
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.000
Is it a sailfish?

11f31c73-f8ec-4c01-b0d4-f90a9dce567e-0
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.686
Perhaps that's Harpoon is going
to like a like a novel the big

11f31c73-f8ec-4c01-b0d4-f90a9dce567e-1
00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:24.634
big big pointy beak at the front
who speared 2 smaller fish. The

11f31c73-f8ec-4c01-b0d4-f90a9dce567e-2
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:29.202
big spotty whale is there with
the paper boat on top of its

11f31c73-f8ec-4c01-b0d4-f90a9dce567e-3
00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:33.542
dorsal fin. Out of the water,
the whale and the fish are

11f31c73-f8ec-4c01-b0d4-f90a9dce567e-4
00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:38.110
underwater, and then there's a
reef heavily populated with.

bcc06920-0dd6-4712-9690-533a34a3d1c8-0
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.810
Fish and.

e0cf9385-d830-4c97-8679-844edc71898e-0
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.530
Oh, what are they called?

5ab86f60-831b-433a-9c20-42e67c058d3f-0
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.803
Reef reef. Reef creatures. Lots
and lots of small fish going in

5ab86f60-831b-433a-9c20-42e67c058d3f-1
00:06:48.803 --> 00:06:52.130
and out of the crevices,
oblivious to the boat above.

90de0405-a2b7-4bfa-8618-a33d866f06ef-0
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.730
Yeah, all right.

9d7008b1-668c-49ce-8a01-3d3c03bf1723-0
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.102
Bull Reef now again a double
page spread. Lots and lots and

9d7008b1-668c-49ce-8a01-3d3c03bf1723-1
00:07:02.102 --> 00:07:02.790
lots of fish.

fd36c132-019f-4bb6-a2c3-921528a589b8-0
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.690
Small paper boat is still afloat
about it all.

3d3bae68-dfbb-4b31-8ed5-f8a454ed5574-0
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.140
Below we have a selection of
stripey and spotted and.

2467bd02-e65e-410a-bfc8-6f4d96034443-0
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.950
All all manner of different
shapes and sizes of small fish.

976a85f2-e955-43f5-b4dc-a9572d60f1e1-0
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.510
And.

e60d2a9a-2725-4a9d-beb8-5fc918340492-0
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.209
And coral. Coral was the word I
couldn't recall little minute

e60d2a9a-2725-4a9d-beb8-5fc918340492-1
00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:23.200
ago. The coral reef.

23d1acb3-64ee-4d40-9728-55164d577e3c-0
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.760
{What's going on?}

5a5f43de-76cc-4c41-a2a2-01f27ce42f4a-0
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.460
{Would you like me to?}

6391170e-5907-48bf-b809-481c942fdcce-0
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.640
That's I can't think of anything
else. Let me go.

ccff91fd-3f07-4c30-8f6d-0147b316a31b-0
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.310
Now we got two boats it seems,
unless it's it seems to be a

ccff91fd-3f07-4c30-8f6d-0147b316a31b-1
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.610
double page spreads, there's
lots of little fish, so we see

ccff91fd-3f07-4c30-8f6d-0147b316a31b-2
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.940
these.

332169e4-5748-44b0-947b-6f5f5f875f01-0
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.810
This seemed to be the same scene
we got the original paper about.

8ad32b81-8eb5-49db-a078-43a9a6e42d55-0
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.390
With.

ec6b5e48-564a-420a-9a31-9fdd3b4545e9-0
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.276
Squid climbing aboard it. Lots
of stripey fish. Couple fish

ec6b5e48-564a-420a-9a31-9fdd3b4545e9-1
00:07:54.276 --> 00:07:57.200
kissing each other by the coral
reef.

092d5d42-1acd-4809-bd7d-3eda2d0923d2-0
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.660
And the next page over.

1c61a543-9c71-4953-b181-99da19c62a00-0
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.482
Is either another boat or the
same boat. Now it has a fishing

1c61a543-9c71-4953-b181-99da19c62a00-1
00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:09.339
rod over the side. There's
actually caught a fish doesn't

1c61a543-9c71-4953-b181-99da19c62a00-2
00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:10.470
show who's who's.

3b0b9b57-9386-417f-b190-526a46da0d5d-0
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.364
Who's using the fishing rod?
Maybe it's a squid that climbed

3b0b9b57-9386-417f-b190-526a46da0d5d-1
00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:14.710
aboard?

60549cb4-ebd6-4f39-baf2-7830c784686f-0
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.530
But below that you have maybe a
shark.

6f0cc9fa-26e9-480c-9345-0c33c9d749e3-0
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.439
And lots of small stripey or
spotty feature different sizes.

6f0cc9fa-26e9-480c-9345-0c33c9d749e3-1
00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:26.480
One's been caught by the angler.

0a23fe47-36f9-4e25-a42f-cb8bcf7c936d-0
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.660
Doesn't look too happy about it.

2b7006d5-1a5c-46c3-b375-6cb1b49efbc7-0
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:32.940
Is it?

900512d9-7ff2-4ccd-b921-453f6a85b714-0
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.650
Next one needs 2 2 2 images 1
the boat.

5c3ec53a-58f0-40c2-990e-ab2238785cc6-0
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:46.810
Has no angular or people aboard.
Below it is the coral reef.

4543c7b9-d08d-4767-9d0c-5ee7bcda0775-0
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.502
Well to stripey fishes of
different sizes, one fish is

4543c7b9-d08d-4767-9d0c-5ee7bcda0775-1
00:08:51.502 --> 00:08:55.974
jumping out of the water with
possibly a Harlequin Sea horse

4543c7b9-d08d-4767-9d0c-5ee7bcda0775-2
00:08:55.974 --> 00:09:00.813
on top of it.  in turn wearing a
paper hat that is similar to the

4543c7b9-d08d-4767-9d0c-5ee7bcda0775-3
00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:01.620
paper boat.

3b334a49-d8d9-49ff-b21b-0730c7a4a09e-0
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.210
No people.

628a9807-1f43-4127-85bb-3989c19c2516-0
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.550
The next screen shows a manta
ray with a not too smiley face

2b3d0383-0192-4b6a-92cc-5c478e71c5c4-0
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.950
Number of number of rays all of
the.

50bdf485-b3bf-4207-a620-0b0992fe70ef-0
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.850
And the spotty 1.

c09ead93-45f7-4fdc-acef-d3bd596052f7-0
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.701
Well, the are the worms or coral
creatures all that have big heap

c09ead93-45f7-4fdc-acef-d3bd596052f7-1
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.208
underneath the boat. And indeed
the Harlequin seahorse has

c09ead93-45f7-4fdc-acef-d3bd596052f7-2
00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:27.500
climbed aboard. And there's a.

c9c12b33-f029-4574-afab-f69ef5146734-0
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.977
Tentacle or a large worm
climbing on board the paper boat

c9c12b33-f029-4574-afab-f69ef5146734-1
00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:32.500
as well.

bba88c43-6628-47a8-a0c2-91de3e2eee80-0
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.360
There's lots lots going on in
this image.

7edb8031-7d7e-4678-9587-147e298d1405-0
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.500
The tree.

16ea5f0b-82fc-4fe6-a596-447deb789189-0
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.330
Possibly on a pond or a small
lake.

e723f71b-bcf3-4f1e-a112-edd2f00ea501-0
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.796
It does have waves that could be
a whole island in the ocean. I

e723f71b-bcf3-4f1e-a112-edd2f00ea501-1
00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:58.100
expect trees full of birds maybe
there.

6bdb0cd7-da76-46bd-8686-a6f63419db52-0
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.270
Just to show what the birds are,
to be honest.

23e07c86-113e-4f3d-bfb9-acd2af1221f7-0
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.900
It could be flamingos, perhaps.

521d4063-e378-4b24-93c3-4ef882d9fcdc-0
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.255
It's black and white, so I don't
know what color they are. {It

521d4063-e378-4b24-93c3-4ef882d9fcdc-1
00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:13.390
looks like one of my tree of I
can see there's my office

521d4063-e378-4b24-93c3-4ef882d9fcdc-2
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.910
window. We have a tree full of
cattle egrets at the moment, but

521d4063-e378-4b24-93c3-4ef882d9fcdc-3
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.045
anyway} this is but there's
there's little plants in the

521d4063-e378-4b24-93c3-4ef882d9fcdc-4
00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:23.180
water so it could be a pond
rather than the ocean, and a

521d4063-e378-4b24-93c3-4ef882d9fcdc-5
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.160
score or more of birds in the
tree.

62bd0936-b50c-4f0e-8269-3bba25ed0672-0
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.840
And and an empty boat. oh the
boat.

ed4dd125-db3b-433e-9726-ee7cbe7c2f77-0
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.290
Still has the Harlequin.

4df37796-9004-42ab-8f76-bd2fd69b33c5-0
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.865
Seahorse aborted, but no people
and no anglers and we don't see

4df37796-9004-42ab-8f76-bd2fd69b33c5-1
00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:39.860
under the water this time now.
{Ohh sorry.}

348a76ae-8da7-46eb-8d8e-90a58fdb5754-0
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.740
{I actually missed class.}

effed920-83fb-4e60-8670-d86b8f395e6c-0
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.340
{Were you ready to go to that?}

0ca2ce78-1cbd-466e-a810-7cd27fdbca8b-0
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.390
{That's it. Now we're back.}

c3a8833d-d217-4689-9117-c7bec7668ed0-0
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.679
Under, under and above the
water. So we're looking at the

c3a8833d-d217-4689-9117-c7bec7668ed0-1
00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:57.340
tree and also we're looking at
the roots underneath the tree.

7fd8dc2b-3c41-4e76-8dd8-cfc328e0ebea-0
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.130
And we have the plants growing
up out of the ocean.

c57b19b4-f820-4599-b955-757746ab4f52-0
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.603
Or pond above above the water
line, where the paper bloaters,

c57b19b4-f820-4599-b955-757746ab4f52-1
00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:09.540
Bloaters now floating with the
harder Quincy horse. That's what

c57b19b4-f820-4599-b955-757746ab4f52-2
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:09.910
it is.

d1f87ffd-800d-4f49-b144-3b1814eb2c11-0
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.987
And the flamingos, I don't think
they are flamingos. Don't know

d1f87ffd-800d-4f49-b144-3b1814eb2c11-1
00:11:14.987 --> 00:11:18.859
what they are, some sort of
fatuous beast. And there are

d1f87ffd-800d-4f49-b144-3b1814eb2c11-2
00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:23.207
lots of different varieties of
fish and starfish underneath and

d1f87ffd-800d-4f49-b144-3b1814eb2c11-3
00:11:23.207 --> 00:11:26.400
stripes and spots and the Shoal
of small fish.

c19a8bb8-181d-40e1-af96-46bc09742c8c-0
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.510
Meandering in and out of the
reeds.

7b211fd8-9156-403c-9c3e-635f1775d284-0
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.150
Nothing floating above the on
the ocean the other than the

7b211fd8-9156-403c-9c3e-635f1775d284-1
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.400
paper, the paper boat.

36eddbd9-9db9-473e-a7d9-7732a4b0163f-0
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.270
Here we are now looking.

1ee3159c-e77f-43cb-9e4f-0a5dd0ad5d80-0
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.220
From a little to say, it looks
like the.

d51fb3c6-40f0-4510-b9dc-2f36acb95e76-0
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.439
OK. I think we're above the
water line now and we're seeing

d51fb3c6-40f0-4510-b9dc-2f36acb95e76-1
00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:59.369
into the Grove of trees or
plants that have grown up out of

d51fb3c6-40f0-4510-b9dc-2f36acb95e76-2
00:11:59.369 --> 00:12:03.299
the water. But it looks like
there is some fish in the tree

d51fb3c6-40f0-4510-b9dc-2f36acb95e76-3
00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:04.740
as well as some birds.

d92a7922-083d-46f3-a8b9-d343faf566be-0
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.220
They've all got luminescent eyes
and the.

41f25826-f152-4fd1-9319-a19e1a9f95d4-0
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.060
Paper boat is afloat with the.

53af8fa5-6345-47f0-bcbd-96e7ed2ad1bc-0
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.931
Harlequin seahorse upon it, and
there are some hands appearing

53af8fa5-6345-47f0-bcbd-96e7ed2ad1bc-1
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:16.470
out of the.

6a539919-2dd0-49ac-9248-1e25a3ed119a-0
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.360
Out of the dimness.

ef28170e-b697-4635-94ba-54171a069a41-0
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.142
Which might be something similar
to some sort of reptilian

ef28170e-b697-4635-94ba-54171a069a41-1
00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:23.770
creature.

b7436c90-46cc-4294-abc2-7973917c04e4-0
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.978
Or maybe not. We can't see the
body of the thing, just the

b7436c90-46cc-4294-abc2-7973917c04e4-1
00:12:27.978 --> 00:12:28.260
hands.

2b38a3b9-621a-47ca-a944-d0b8f4e97e59-0
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.670
A bit like a mangrove swamp, it
seems to be.

350c8f43-27fc-4aa3-8ce9-0b391a6e20ea-0
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.580
Little bit spooky.

fe217266-f76c-4871-9c84-2fd7f5adb029-0
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.810

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.230
{Back now.}

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.364
The double page spread with two
boats. One has the Harlequin

2574152d-e188-4e9d-8ccf-85fe17286896-1
00:12:51.364 --> 00:12:56.168
seahorse on it. The other one,
the seahorse, jumped off the

2574152d-e188-4e9d-8ccf-85fe17286896-2
00:12:56.168 --> 00:12:58.410
boat and lost his paper hat.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.535
It could be two different
images. I'm not sure whether

da6b961b-f302-441d-9e5e-40fc03c98614-1
00:13:02.535 --> 00:13:04.130
it's one combined or two
separate.

e23acbe7-5b69-4a36-830b-5445818d8ec9-0
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.440
There's a.

8f4feca7-0050-4aae-98b3-edb6159eed66-0
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.760
Seahorse loves the stripey fish.
Lots of coral growth.

def7a325-1abf-4949-9270-73b5c718390d-0
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.130
A Moray eagle is in the.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.110
2.

9cf3bde8-11d2-466c-86e4-dcea7a3894ed-0
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.230
oh and a lobster. There's a
lobster there with with.

3db505be-4f46-4dd5-a0e2-067c5abde754-0
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.410
Maybe a speculative seahorse
riding in the back of a lobster?

ea071c3d-64cf-4283-a122-b9581e728f66-0
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.980
#END_wanderer Yeah.

8ae3c761-101c-48ac-ac85-4687540d4d61-0
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.390
Perfect. Who's the artist?

203bec17-43d0-4499-af79-72828258dc90-0
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.190
Actually not sure this is a
book called The Wanderer so.

268dba69-7c6b-41e0-bd08-8602ae772bde-0
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.990
Whoever wrote the wanderer?

143abd04-2c7d-42d2-9b28-d4347595147c-0
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.280
Edward Lear, who looks a bit
like that.

8e6a4bcd-806d-4032-ad2b-5b8da0dfd24d-0
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.450
I know the the pictures are
really beautiful snow.

84ebdc97-9023-4247-be2e-e78aedded21e-0
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.800
I'm going to pull up the next
one.

bb7b6f1a-82cf-4ecc-8f64-a395ed0b6d4c-0
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.437
Was that the sort of thing you
wanted? I don't know. I just

bb7b6f1a-82cf-4ecc-8f64-a395ed0b6d4c-1
00:14:03.437 --> 00:14:07.024
just rambling on, just babbling
on, really telling a story

bb7b6f1a-82cf-4ecc-8f64-a395ed0b6d4c-2
00:14:07.024 --> 00:14:08.240
because I couldn't.

bf0e2c4d-b6c1-4c9f-8c79-3b03b8087ffc-0
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.978
We did a good job. Some of them
will be easier to tell stories

bf0e2c4d-b6c1-4c9f-8c79-3b03b8087ffc-1
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:16.023
than other ones. OK, we just
give that prompt because we're

bf0e2c4d-b6c1-4c9f-8c79-3b03b8087ffc-2
00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.510
just trying to see how you
describe things and.

0dd0ec95-1708-49f7-b423-ba0f126b4b77-0
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.590
I think you did a great job,
OK?

ebea8296-2cf8-4dff-ad37-a81d4e21159e-0
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.030


d7888131-ead9-4585-92ba-65615fe1ba98-0
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.780
And now I'm going to pull up
your next one.

c7de2c24-575e-4a00-95e4-42e57da4567b-0
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.220
Oh here I forgot I have to
open.

a8e394b2-d61c-4bcb-9ff4-ec17d096156e-0
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.110
Or download it. 

5e240aed-7648-4d5b-9e9a-74141cbc2af1-0
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:58.368
OK, so this is going to be our
next one. This one is fairly

5e240aed-7648-4d5b-9e9a-74141cbc2af1-1
00:14:58.368 --> 00:14:58.850
short.

4ce5e571-694b-4dbc-ac06-bd7623cdd1ac-0
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.461
Can you see my screen? Yes, yes.
The yes. Perfect. OK, I'm going

4ce5e571-694b-4dbc-ac06-bd7623cdd1ac-1
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:14.330
to play this one start.

1e7b7e9c-6a0f-4441-9fba-1bf6a985e154-0
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.510
We ready? Yes, we are ready. And
this is also a story.

f0dde6d6-7a69-4482-adb8-0cbfb92a0d61-0
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.002
#START_arrival_2 OK, let's go
all the story. OK, we we're

f0dde6d6-7a69-4482-adb8-0cbfb92a0d61-1
00:15:29.002 --> 00:15:33.350
going to series of dozen small
pictures on the left hand side.

e74e161d-a569-4417-8837-2ef0c3783099-0
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.819
And then a larger image on the
right side from the left you've

e74e161d-a569-4417-8837-2ef0c3783099-1
00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:36.980
got.

97499505-1798-4f65-8b24-e50694c49668-0
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:43.182
Possibly three women'Middle
Eastern attire and then three

97499505-1798-4f65-8b24-e50694c49668-1
00:15:43.182 --> 00:15:45.420
men wearing flat caps. So.

e0f2d299-c7a9-4d3d-a631-2b2ec94a4438-0
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.346
I expect they're waiting to
board a ship. There's one woman

e0f2d299-c7a9-4d3d-a631-2b2ec94a4438-1
00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:50.280
carrying an infant.

cd1fce15-f98b-4a42-9280-4dc63e59d768-0
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.980
Maybe the?

79a87b16-986f-4b7f-aeda-6d9a32983268-0
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.130
Irish immigrants have last 19th
century coming to America,

79a87b16-986f-4b7f-aeda-6d9a32983268-1
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.710
perhaps.

4be64cc6-fae8-43df-b12b-5c354c473bcb-0
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.942
Lots of luggage around, and one
fellow's keeping a journal, and

4be64cc6-fae8-43df-b12b-5c354c473bcb-1
00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:09.627
he's ripping a page out of that
journal and making a paper boat.

4be64cc6-fae8-43df-b12b-5c354c473bcb-2
00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:13.880
No, he's not. He's making a
paper origami bird and he's a.

3287e19b-f517-419c-9074-55596df9635e-0
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.960
He's got a shirt with no tie in
a hat and he's made this folded.

94ef2113-ab39-4cd2-91cc-903a1bc7ad9c-0
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.349
But which may or may not be a
Flamingo like the other ones,

94ef2113-ab39-4cd2-91cc-903a1bc7ad9c-1
00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:27.919
probably not. We got him there
on the next page wearing his

94ef2113-ab39-4cd2-91cc-903a1bc7ad9c-2
00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:28.990
hat, and he's got.

c3971a4b-6c31-4764-ba7f-01432fc68e89-0
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.772
It still doesn't have a tie on,
but he's got his collar buttoned

c3971a4b-6c31-4764-ba7f-01432fc68e89-1
00:16:32.772 --> 00:16:33.550
wearing his suit.

cb6f98b7-25b6-4806-ad7a-448c3acb8353-0
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.922
And presumably he's let the bird
free, and he's now looking up

cb6f98b7-25b6-4806-ad7a-448c3acb8353-1
00:16:38.922 --> 00:16:43.050
with his hand shielding his eyes
as he watches the bird

cb6f98b7-25b6-4806-ad7a-448c3acb8353-2
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:47.103
disappear. And the larger
picture below that shows the

cb6f98b7-25b6-4806-ad7a-448c3acb8353-3
00:16:47.103 --> 00:16:48.430
crowded deck of a.

34a0ce9e-4d14-47ac-9737-0dae248542b4-0
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.850
Crew of of of of a ship.

f4e77705-1255-4bdf-aa15-296c22b75806-0
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.697
Yeah, and and and overflying the
ship are scores of the similar

f4e77705-1255-4bdf-aa15-296c22b75806-1
00:16:57.697 --> 00:17:02.964
paper birds flying around in a
small flock. Not everybody's

f4e77705-1255-4bdf-aa15-296c22b75806-2
00:17:02.964 --> 00:17:05.510
paying any attention to them.

5de76b04-e3df-48c5-b7a2-d4ce783685f4-0
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.354
I don't see whether anybody is.
No one seems to be paying any

5de76b04-e3df-48c5-b7a2-d4ce783685f4-1
00:17:09.354 --> 00:17:11.987
attention. One person is
pointing at them, but the rest

5de76b04-e3df-48c5-b7a2-d4ce783685f4-2
00:17:11.987 --> 00:17:14.150
of the big N two people are
pointing at them.

267ba468-10b3-47a6-9c55-3875288458a4-0
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.780
With the long tailed.

35765c97-05ae-496e-a316-26a9068f44b9-0
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.238
Fabulous small birds flying
around above this this the deck

35765c97-05ae-496e-a316-26a9068f44b9-1
00:17:22.238 --> 00:17:23.030
of the ship.

edab1cf9-50c6-4c0b-8000-f6e50b2ea8b9-0
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.560
Which may or may not be full of
immigrants.

f3da0901-dcd1-4561-afc3-8f6a4077aae4-0
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.390


c939b6bc-ce80-4a90-840d-bfaac4f7e4c2-0
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.851
Oh, here we go there. Arriving
at the promised land, which

c939b6bc-ce80-4a90-840d-bfaac4f7e4c2-1
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:43.923
looks pretty Gray and Gray. The
images are like Victorian

c939b6bc-ce80-4a90-840d-bfaac4f7e4c2-2
00:17:43.923 --> 00:17:48.135
postcards of the time, which
made me think of people coming

c939b6bc-ce80-4a90-840d-bfaac4f7e4c2-3
00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:52.277
to America. But then so crowded
deck, lots of ships in the

c939b6bc-ce80-4a90-840d-bfaac4f7e4c2-4
00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:56.489
harbor, small ships in the
harbour, coming into a city full

c939b6bc-ce80-4a90-840d-bfaac4f7e4c2-5
00:17:56.489 --> 00:17:56.700
of.

b453e798-21f6-47bb-ae6c-9413be2de1dc-0
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.230
High rise?

6d976d78-8fee-4e2f-b603-7adbc06b5e48-0
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.366
Buildings with lots of birds
flying above them. The next

6d976d78-8fee-4e2f-b603-7adbc06b5e48-1
00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:02.730
screen.

3f9f189c-c973-4e3d-b027-e1d90ae361ad-0
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.474
As two fabulous statues, perhaps
at the entrance to the middle of

3f9f189c-c973-4e3d-b027-e1d90ae361ad-1
00:18:09.474 --> 00:18:12.290
the harbour with the Steamboat.

a98b54d5-fbef-415c-bdad-03fa908bbfde-0
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.121
And marker boys mocking the
channel of the largest theme. It

a98b54d5-fbef-415c-bdad-03fa908bbfde-1
00:18:17.121 --> 00:18:20.897
should should pass people
looking over the railings that

a98b54d5-fbef-415c-bdad-03fa908bbfde-2
00:18:20.897 --> 00:18:23.150
where they're going to
disembark.

c68475e2-7bc9-4b27-98b0-b6a3f5a844f3-0
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.039
And to I'm assuming those
statues that may not be, they

c68475e2-7bc9-4b27-98b0-b6a3f5a844f3-1
00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.960
may be real giant eagle with.

37365e55-6e16-4aff-bb02-11d73f48892c-0
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.023
On boats with large containers,
a large teapot which seems to be

37365e55-6e16-4aff-bb02-11d73f48892c-1
00:18:36.023 --> 00:18:38.020
bigger than the steamer ship.

e327dc94-8d02-43c8-8c48-4218c7ad07e5-0
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.110
And the shaking hands left
handedly.

bb73d00a-4cda-4191-971d-78add260620a-0
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.710
One's got a.

69265b52-9bc4-4872-9183-c9189e600ea5-0
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.924
Crawl through the rabbit and the
and a monkey sitting on his arm

69265b52-9bc4-4872-9183-c9189e600ea5-1
00:18:47.924 --> 00:18:51.719
and they're wearing funny hats.
Ones got to like a Faiz hat and

69265b52-9bc4-4872-9183-c9189e600ea5-2
00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:55.217
the ones got a pointy hat.
Fellow with the pointy hats got

69265b52-9bc4-4872-9183-c9189e600ea5-3
00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:58.360
a bird on his shoulder, maybe a
parrot or some sort.

b45f0eaf-b1da-4159-a773-4245090423ec-0
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.152
With large cityscape behind it,
all in sepia tones, like a

b45f0eaf-b1da-4159-a773-4245090423ec-1
00:19:04.152 --> 00:19:05.770
Victorian postcard.

f1b5da76-0534-43b2-9b23-334b5658dd6f-0
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.840
And here we got the Titanic
coming into dock.

763eb66b-e89c-4612-9a4c-1d0f943eb4de-0
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.407
But we're not going to do it,
say setting sail and unlikely,

763eb66b-e89c-4612-9a4c-1d0f943eb4de-1
00:19:19.407 --> 00:19:23.298
adopting it as the Titanic, lots
of other clouds or smoke from

763eb66b-e89c-4612-9a4c-1d0f943eb4de-2
00:19:23.298 --> 00:19:24.410
the steam engines.

6a1b7e16-6adf-407c-911b-cd37fb69641f-0
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.916
Coming in to all the boys that
were presumably is coming into.

6a1b7e16-6adf-407c-911b-cd37fb69641f-1
00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:31.470
It's the view from the.

07c358d2-8585-4f5f-8431-f9e3e8fc038b-0
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.821
City side looking at the boat
approaching and then we see

07c358d2-8585-4f5f-8431-f9e3e8fc038b-1
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:39.641
again the people on the boat
getting ready to disembark as a

07c358d2-8585-4f5f-8431-f9e3e8fc038b-2
00:19:39.641 --> 00:19:43.210
member of the top hat and a
megaphone, presumably giving

07c358d2-8585-4f5f-8431-f9e3e8fc038b-3
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.780
instructions of where to go,
someones opening the gates.

ef63f276-9420-4541-b7ba-1c6ad1fda592-0
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.761
And fellow with his suitcase in
his hand and a family with a

ef63f276-9420-4541-b7ba-1c6ad1fda592-1
00:19:51.761 --> 00:19:53.630
child and their belongings.

c2b15665-be4f-4fba-a625-9ebf1237cbb8-0
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.450
Coming down the gangplank and
then.

c28809fb-47b2-48b1-a6e7-74b3bd69c2c2-0
00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.977
Either for
gathering or processing towards

c28809fb-47b2-48b1-a6e7-74b3bd69c2c2-1
00:20:00.977 --> 00:20:05.123
the the next stage, the boat at
the final picture is is moored.

c28809fb-47b2-48b1-a6e7-74b3bd69c2c2-2
00:20:05.123 --> 00:20:08.880
So they've landed and now
they're disembarking in the new

c28809fb-47b2-48b1-a6e7-74b3bd69c2c2-3
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.500
the new the new location. #END_arrival_2

f8421868-9d20-4dd0-8cfd-54ecb8176f5f-0
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.770
OK, perfect. So going to.

cb175540-7ba9-4594-a90d-19b500d65e0b-0
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.530
Pull up our next one.

593820dd-dec8-4cc6-b5d4-582c1dbdeb8a-0
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.380
OK, let's see what we have next.

8b659d93-3289-4e73-b7ff-603ac4af16c3-0
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:39.850
OK.

2ec427ba-961e-49a7-93b6-9e9cb7f377d2-0
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.090
Poop.

8a50e9b5-2013-44ad-9329-3fdf9c895ff9-0
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.720
Download.

50dfa9ad-fd88-404a-b7dc-c3401c65b043-0
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.300
And download.

691b06cc-405a-460c-b1f2-a35aff22e2a1-0
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.850
And I'm going to share my
screen again.

84844233-54e2-4758-9087-2f36ea2fbc90-0
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:18.046
Alright, and I need to play from
start once again. This is also a

84844233-54e2-4758-9087-2f36ea2fbc90-1
00:21:18.046 --> 00:21:22.780
short story, so just tell me
when to flip.

51c5b16f-9027-472b-9089-bc70892d7888-0
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.351
Tell tell you what? Sorry. Just
tell me when to switch the

51c5b16f-9027-472b-9089-bc70892d7888-1
00:21:28.351 --> 00:21:32.002
screen. Ohh. OK, hold on.
We'll, we'll, we'll

51c5b16f-9027-472b-9089-bc70892d7888-2
00:21:32.002 --> 00:21:35.654
we'll move on. OK. #START_quest There's 2
pages of a book. It's in color.

51c5b16f-9027-472b-9089-bc70892d7888-3
00:21:35.654 --> 00:21:37.330
This time it looks brighter.

6cb7ca52-ce25-44b4-87f6-249c22964c07-0
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.742
There are some words on it, but
they're too small to read it,

6cb7ca52-ce25-44b4-87f6-249c22964c07-1
00:21:41.742 --> 00:21:42.600
says for Darcy.

53ce21fb-2ced-4618-92e5-5b9dc89b4425-0
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.496
Oh, that's just copyright
information. And it shows I

53ce21fb-2ced-4618-92e5-5b9dc89b4425-1
00:21:48.496 --> 00:21:50.500
expect it's a City Park.

a45b99f5-8b43-4c9d-bc24-28a65fe5f731-0
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.754
Whether it's Central Park or
not, I don't know. And the

a45b99f5-8b43-4c9d-bc24-28a65fe5f731-1
00:21:54.754 --> 00:21:55.630
statue of the.

6b14bde0-317a-4585-be7c-d57928fb8111-0
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:03.090
Winged Roman Gladiator Centurion
type person.

b13963df-b137-478c-a4e1-1f208151c3d7-0
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.602
Holding something in his hand, I
can't see what it is, and trees

b13963df-b137-478c-a4e1-1f208151c3d7-1
00:22:08.602 --> 00:22:11.940
are almost bare of leaves, so
it's either autumn or.

be59a289-0f26-432e-aed9-a0947b5e6823-0
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.898
spring there's a lamp post. I
can't see what sort of lamp it

be59a289-0f26-432e-aed9-a0947b5e6823-1
00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:17.670
is atop it.

d1bcd536-f3cf-4491-9491-183c683e7ad4-0
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.154
Shooting in the Gaslamp,
perhaps, and a park bench. And a

d1bcd536-f3cf-4491-9491-183c683e7ad4-1
00:22:23.154 --> 00:22:24.470
waste paper basket.

0e51d2b8-9dcd-4637-96ab-27c4d220102d-0
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.650
And then the next group which is
in color shows.

ba789d43-7326-4574-ad25-3aed2b64b8db-0
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.409
What's a bridge, which I think
is a continuation of the first

ba789d43-7326-4574-ad25-3aed2b64b8db-1
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:37.387
picture. We see more of that
now. It's a it's a bridge and

ba789d43-7326-4574-ad25-3aed2b64b8db-2
00:22:37.387 --> 00:22:39.410
they're underneath the bridge.

3d454631-b5d3-49d5-a66a-261f3a5ff5a7-0
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.065
Sheltering from the rain, and
then you see the rain splashing

3d454631-b5d3-49d5-a66a-261f3a5ff5a7-1
00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:43.790
in the puddles.

901d4aeb-eb02-4204-8f0b-1c93a33fd76c-0
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:45.220
The.

95b0586e-f52a-4f76-99b6-839a4bf81e2f-0
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.760
There's the age of a statue,
another statue.

0866264b-c6bd-4ade-bac5-b55ffba4f710-0
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.458
Which might be a mermaid. It's
got a tail. There's either

0866264b-c6bd-4ade-bac5-b55ffba4f710-1
00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:58.694
something and a fish, or it's a
mermaid and a small bird like a

0866264b-c6bd-4ade-bac5-b55ffba4f710-2
00:22:58.694 --> 00:23:02.599
great tit sitting on the on
this, on, on, on the hand, but

0866264b-c6bd-4ade-bac5-b55ffba4f710-3
00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:03.460
two children.

5d84003c-55f6-4f1a-889a-0f20a9467b9a-0
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.732
Sheltering under the bridges of
there's a tandem bicycle that

5d84003c-55f6-4f1a-889a-0f20a9467b9a-1
00:23:09.732 --> 00:23:14.010
they presumably arrived upon,
and the park bench and the.

5531d23e-814e-448a-a627-5bc8ffbccc1a-0
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.960
A statue all like, almost.

9da4b1a9-1590-4b30-a78e-a9391802abd9-0
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.370
Skinny Buddha statue.

032cee02-422d-4d93-bb2a-c0324e20fce6-0
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.888
But there's an interesting door,
interestingly shaped to door and

032cee02-422d-4d93-bb2a-c0324e20fce6-1
00:23:28.888 --> 00:23:33.359
carvings around it, and when an
electric light above them. So

032cee02-422d-4d93-bb2a-c0324e20fce6-2
00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:33.720
it's.

1d6e55fd-01b2-4afa-a8de-00de33a80763-0
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.500
And two gas lights and the park
bench.

a12b1c67-dcc9-4e2c-a621-95405269a977-0
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.449
So I think that's I think, I
think it's, I think it's a City

a12b1c67-dcc9-4e2c-a621-95405269a977-1
00:23:41.449 --> 00:23:43.570
Park in the rain, so bring on
the bridge.

627dd984-7375-4daa-b952-32ffb9c84a9f-0
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.422
And I expect one of the children
is looking is eyeing sideways

627dd984-7375-4daa-b952-32ffb9c84a9f-1
00:23:48.422 --> 00:23:52.498
the door that it's standing next
to. So maybe, maybe the next

627dd984-7375-4daa-b952-32ffb9c84a9f-2
00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:56.246
page will move, we will go
through the door into the the

627dd984-7375-4daa-b952-32ffb9c84a9f-3
00:23:56.246 --> 00:23:56.969
next thing.

9cf896e2-09b0-4f00-ae81-afab21581129-0
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.590
And would you like me to flip
the pages, please? Yeah.

715fa0d5-e0d2-4b65-b94d-31b45b85fe62-0
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.491
There you go. They haven't gone
in through the door, but a

715fa0d5-e0d2-4b65-b94d-31b45b85fe62-1
00:24:06.491 --> 00:24:10.450
wizard has come out through the
door with a purple.

5aad4a1c-03a7-4a23-a835-af61c132f6d1-0
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.280
Fabulous bird.

d076c7bc-ce3f-41b1-b7cd-8f56dcdce900-0
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.880
And the wizard is showing the
children a.

9661feef-0fe4-4dc0-9b5f-03ab82be4917-0
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.540
Parchment which might be a map
or symbols on it.

ad54de10-5827-4171-8eef-36e02d7eea91-0
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.527
And the children are shocked and
have fallen down the the the

ad54de10-5827-4171-8eef-36e02d7eea91-1
00:24:24.527 --> 00:24:27.623
more contemporary children
because they got T-shirts and

ad54de10-5827-4171-8eef-36e02d7eea91-2
00:24:27.623 --> 00:24:29.850
shorts, so they're not Victorian
at all.

456afa08-c142-4ab7-8d9d-630917aadb2f-0
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.352
The the wizard is looking a
little stern at them, and the

456afa08-c142-4ab7-8d9d-630917aadb2f-1
00:24:35.352 --> 00:24:40.400
the the doorway, the the the the
the carvings above the door.

381dd415-b680-4d5c-b923-35a589864f98-0
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.400
Seems to be an octopus of some
sort.

00b318a6-f1bf-4a39-81f8-a689e2e3c22b-0
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.628
And children, very shocked, once
full, and then the ones about to

00b318a6-f1bf-4a39-81f8-a689e2e3c22b-1
00:24:49.628 --> 00:24:53.981
fall down. There was, it looks a
bit like Dumbledore's Cloak, a

00b318a6-f1bf-4a39-81f8-a689e2e3c22b-2
00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:54.730
long beard.

5d933270-62fc-40a3-a05f-15acfb6f2347-0
00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.950
And so the next page.

847fe41f-9716-495e-8282-2527690b96dd-0
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.790
We have three scenes the.

5322d1f4-16df-4509-a214-2a39b78e6e71-0
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.137
Wizard is showing the parchment
to one of the children and

5322d1f4-16df-4509-a214-2a39b78e6e71-1
00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:10.345
pointing at it, so he's and the
bird is now sitting on the

5322d1f4-16df-4509-a214-2a39b78e6e71-2
00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:13.840
child's shoulder while the other
child is being.

ae15cc13-9767-42b7-95e2-8a22369d8501-0
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.461
Held on the shoulder by the
wizard and they they seemed to

ae15cc13-9767-42b7-95e2-8a22369d8501-1
00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:22.275
be. He doesn't seem to be
crossed this time. I think he's

ae15cc13-9767-42b7-95e2-8a22369d8501-2
00:25:22.275 --> 00:25:24.070
instructing them on what to do
next.

b2658b02-225d-4e1f-a396-40d5cab9aca7-0
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.690
And then the next.

597bd0bd-8935-486d-bfa5-3b4081f5f16c-0
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.730
Seen shows 2.

79a34079-20e7-4859-b38d-933ecdedcfd6-0
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.810
Hmm. Middle Ages.

9659e933-6377-4e1e-b3f5-4979515d5f97-0
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.920
Guards with Spears coming out
through the doorway and and

9659e933-6377-4e1e-b3f5-4979515d5f97-1
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.580
apprehending the wizard. The
Purple Bird has flown away.

e2aad171-5bb8-491a-b618-31e2c2eb796a-0
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:50.584
The wizard is let go of what
might be a small wand or a looks

e2aad171-5bb8-491a-b618-31e2c2eb796a-1
00:25:50.584 --> 00:25:54.449
a bit like a stick of dynamite.
I'm sure it doesn't and the

e2aad171-5bb8-491a-b618-31e2c2eb796a-2
00:25:54.449 --> 00:25:58.444
children are shocked with the
Wizards being taken away by the

e2aad171-5bb8-491a-b618-31e2c2eb796a-3
00:25:58.444 --> 00:26:01.150
guards the children are left
behind with.

303cf9c8-576b-4a39-ba3e-03f97d49d4d2-0
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.510
The role that parchment and.

b089e5dd-6b00-403f-8801-3f4065206894-0
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.845
Two sticks, which will
presumably have some purpose

b089e5dd-6b00-403f-8801-3f4065206894-1
00:26:07.845 --> 00:26:12.103
later, and the purple bird is
stayed with them. The the wizard

b089e5dd-6b00-403f-8801-3f4065206894-2
00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:16.430
doesn't seem too unhappy to be
taken away, and he's he's waving

b089e5dd-6b00-403f-8801-3f4065206894-3
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.120
to the children, I think.

2568cb80-836d-4234-8645-e5e5aa7b550e-0
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.090
We are either waving goodbye or.

f7207043-be52-497d-a549-c56c3bbdccc6-0
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.270
Waving for for them to help him,
I don't know.

f39882c6-0372-4989-9f40-0c84d364af42-0
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.020
Yeah. On the next one. Getting
interesting there, yeah.

c16602c4-c5b0-4117-bf2c-f188b647bd2a-0
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.780
{Do we skip one then, or did we
go? Is that the next one?}

3870edbc-c62d-4333-823c-ef58561917bb-0
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.680
{There we go. Oh, did you? Oh,
this one?}

47694353-5de5-4c21-921d-e4be6845aaad-0
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:44.338
{Yeah. This is this. Is this the
next one? Yeah, because you just

47694353-5de5-4c21-921d-e4be6845aaad-1
00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:45.290
did the. Yeah.}

42998aab-5211-4523-ac48-5019865e0612-0
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.631
So the doors are closed, the
Wizard's being taken back

42998aab-5211-4523-ac48-5019865e0612-1
00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:54.681
inside. The children are left
outside. The Boy child has the

42998aab-5211-4523-ac48-5019865e0612-2
00:26:54.681 --> 00:26:56.540
purple bird on its shoulder.

16edf875-b052-4c68-88c5-853d7328dd74-0
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.376
The girl child is gonna
bandolier with rolled up

16edf875-b052-4c68-88c5-853d7328dd74-1
00:27:02.376 --> 00:27:06.450
parchment perhaps in in the in
the cartridge pouches.

52b50a9d-aa41-4bd6-8d7e-0a71dac2779c-0
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.258
And looking at each other
questioningly as the boys got a

52b50a9d-aa41-4bd6-8d7e-0a71dac2779c-1
00:27:11.258 --> 00:27:11.760
purple.

62197395-f297-48af-bcef-5cea3cfba86e-0
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.438
I was shooting parchment in his
left hand and a larger which

62197395-f297-48af-bcef-5cea3cfba86e-1
00:27:16.438 --> 00:27:19.651
might be a map on his right
hand, and the purple bird is

62197395-f297-48af-bcef-5cea3cfba86e-2
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:21.849
looking down from his shoulder
to see.

6148304c-4c5f-4878-a782-745d3a7e727d-0
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.420
What's going on? The next page
we've got 3 little scenes.

4ff04e1b-2423-4170-b376-40da4ddd47a1-0
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.910
And the children are.

672c038d-4dd8-4b6c-903b-988f46bc63c7-0
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.076
They seem to have found
themselves a set of keys. Don't

672c038d-4dd8-4b6c-903b-988f46bc63c7-1
00:27:36.076 --> 00:27:39.251
know where they came from,
whether they were rolled up in

672c038d-4dd8-4b6c-903b-988f46bc63c7-2
00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:42.700
the parchment or not entirely
sure, but they've now each got a

672c038d-4dd8-4b6c-903b-988f46bc63c7-3
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.110
key they seem to be quite happy
about this.

cd11029f-fbd1-40cc-aced-752706d250fe-0
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.490
And they use it they they need
the two keys to open the door.

cd11029f-fbd1-40cc-aced-752706d250fe-1
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:53.150
They've opened the door and
they're going in that some speed

cd11029f-fbd1-40cc-aced-752706d250fe-2
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.750
and the purple bird with the
long tail is is following them

cd11029f-fbd1-40cc-aced-752706d250fe-3
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.410
in through the in through the
door that the wizard was, was,

cd11029f-fbd1-40cc-aced-752706d250fe-4
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.750
was, was captured and taken back
into.

92c2648d-0357-4eeb-971c-355b06fd2781-0
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:05.810
Next.

a29a7289-ef67-433d-8ff2-7c1f2538cba9-0
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.337
Whether this is the other side
of the door or not, I'm just. I

a29a7289-ef67-433d-8ff2-7c1f2538cba9-1
00:28:12.337 --> 00:28:14.180
don't know. But now, in a, in a,
in a.

af0a8200-74b8-4d04-b76f-c20b733ea0b7-0
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.270
It was like a castle with a Moat
and a waterfall.

0f0739fe-9a36-4544-a7b1-087d5431999a-0
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.440
The two children were there.

6dd7dbd0-5f90-40c1-9eee-e5a9d440b5d1-0
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.840
Appearing behind a rock.

30eea7e8-77ef-4fc8-850a-d3c333ef0365-0
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.430
The body of the Purple Body
Shield, and they're looking

30eea7e8-77ef-4fc8-850a-d3c333ef0365-1
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.450
across the Moat towards the
castle.

9cb816d4-a23c-4d08-b1bf-49f67ef8b30a-0
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.600
Which may be on fire, or it
could be.

e9b8abea-5ae4-4b4f-9da3-d60548fb8948-0
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.960
It could be clouds.

afe847ca-a499-4d04-a297-4adfce9d4a08-0
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.260
It's a.

3dc88149-331e-4332-81d7-1f5919bfe539-0
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.270
Well, the grand castle

e39a80cd-1aab-4903-ba1f-49a8d2be46b8-0
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.020
And there are.

432c91c7-b552-4452-9817-15d1df8a6214-0
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.450
Ohh ships, the originals flowing
for three of them.

529d3a02-3f0e-40ac-b9dc-8a3629eea328-0
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.770
Flying above with.

521ff349-bfab-4177-9430-8a6c2296e288-0
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.480
Guards with Spears on them.

564bf667-844e-4b14-b1a6-c1166a859f27-0
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.904
Let me move on to the next one
and there's there's a paddle

564bf667-844e-4b14-b1a6-c1166a859f27-1
00:28:57.904 --> 00:28:58.640
boat full of.

ed6d2cb3-7686-48c1-95ed-cb7c7c5d36cd-0
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:03.832
Soldiers they gave with Spears
coming out through from the guy

ed6d2cb3-7686-48c1-95ed-cb7c7c5d36cd-1
00:29:03.832 --> 00:29:05.960
from the gazelle into the boat.

8e05d8b6-f895-4f2f-8586-1394a868f25f-0
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.170
And there are people on the
ramparts.

34ca6a47-b5cc-48b4-93a9-9cc564062165-0
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.370
Looking down.

9fe8edd6-37e8-4eef-b6af-a8349fdb7bd8-0
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.104
Whether they're coming to see
the capture the children, we

9fe8edd6-37e8-4eef-b6af-a8349fdb7bd8-1
00:29:15.104 --> 00:29:16.970
don't yet know, but it seems
likely.

1ffad88a-2bfd-4274-81f4-519f9268c9cf-0
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:20.350
Yep.

b4607b41-0590-4fac-8552-9f7ebdfd8370-0
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.979
OK, now the children seem to
have lost the purple bird, but

b4607b41-0590-4fac-8552-9f7ebdfd8370-1
00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:31.618
they're looking at the map. The
girl is pointing to something on

b4607b41-0590-4fac-8552-9f7ebdfd8370-2
00:29:31.618 --> 00:29:33.410
the map that the boy is holding.

340273c9-df5e-4719-aee0-4be92d00553d-0
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.490
And in the background we've got.

c8781d45-3333-4a37-b8b7-bf7975a3827c-0
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.670
The paddle steamer the paddle,
paddle, boat that the.

40772324-d516-4898-9dc3-c66d60bd7564-0
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:45.924
We saw come out from the castle
a minute ago that seems to be

40772324-d516-4898-9dc3-c66d60bd7564-1
00:29:45.924 --> 00:29:49.894
sailing away on top of the
archway. There's three more

40772324-d516-4898-9dc3-c66d60bd7564-2
00:29:49.894 --> 00:29:53.070
boats so there, whether that's
an aqueduct.

7e889c8c-adb0-48f4-b3d1-2498d7aab9b4-0
00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.670
Possibly.

67e0d3ff-2985-43e9-92a1-96518c9ea3f7-0
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.196
And they all have men with
Spears on top looking down at

67e0d3ff-2985-43e9-92a1-96518c9ea3f7-1
00:30:00.196 --> 00:30:00.930
the children.

125dfec0-0cf5-4345-b244-0874d6c5bf38-0
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.430
And the.

f803cde0-a2b0-4ced-93d6-289a51587412-0
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:07.915
There's a waterfall behind them.
Oh, they're purple bird. I found

f803cde0-a2b0-4ced-93d6-289a51587412-1
00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:12.317
this. Bottom right hand corner
is still there and the castles

f803cde0-a2b0-4ced-93d6-289a51587412-2
00:30:12.317 --> 00:30:16.577
got golden couplers on some of
the towers. It's all looking

f803cde0-a2b0-4ced-93d6-289a51587412-3
00:30:16.577 --> 00:30:19.630
rather grand. How many people in
evidence?

f180d150-90d1-46e2-a99c-e8d02fd0fe0e-0
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.970
And then we get a close up of
the map.

285c8da7-9b0c-4d08-8e9c-b3739bd87ee7-0
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.880
Whether it's a treasure map or
not, we remains to be seen.

fe57744d-0e7e-45ba-876d-9f56fcfbbe67-0
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.740
But there's like a circle.

aeea824a-23be-41fa-a23a-8b15dc788a8c-0
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:35.790
With an island in the back of
with the.

faf10ffa-fbd4-467e-8fbf-8601fc977e87-0
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.861
Is it an island or peninsula
suddenly and inserts the boy is

faf10ffa-fbd4-467e-8fbf-8601fc977e87-1
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:46.935
pointing to looks like a Greek
temple underwater? Where maybe

faf10ffa-fbd4-467e-8fbf-8601fc977e87-2
00:30:46.935 --> 00:30:49.800
the lost city of Atlantis
perhaps?

7e7b5eb0-5954-46ed-b5ec-f9e30e6b4588-0
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:54.076
And then there are other circles
on with the management, one with

7e7b5eb0-5954-46ed-b5ec-f9e30e6b4588-1
00:30:54.076 --> 00:30:54.790
the palm tree.

f10232ee-71bf-4e76-a678-a59aeb419700-0
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.730
The other one seems to be a
forest and.

f60ceb41-9e2e-4faa-b06e-79ac205af113-0
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:03.429
No one seems to be the castle
they've now just just arrived

f60ceb41-9e2e-4faa-b06e-79ac205af113-1
00:31:03.429 --> 00:31:03.610
at.

15304e4b-0bb1-47fd-9946-2988657843a8-0
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.100
Yeah, interesting to see what
happens next.

f5932575-d3c5-4765-bd5f-a729efc2bc8e-0
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.726
They're still now they're back
again, hiding behind their rock

f5932575-d3c5-4765-bd5f-a729efc2bc8e-1
00:31:14.726 --> 00:31:17.883
as they were before the purple
birds taking flight. The three

f5932575-d3c5-4765-bd5f-a729efc2bc8e-2
00:31:17.883 --> 00:31:21.191
boats that were on the aqueduct,
I think there's like, these are

f5932575-d3c5-4765-bd5f-a729efc2bc8e-3
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:21.650
the ones.

f9b96578-678e-41d5-8a04-e59c0a7a1a03-0
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.774
And they're pointing at the
children and making their way

f9b96578-678e-41d5-8a04-e59c0a7a1a03-1
00:31:25.774 --> 00:31:29.570
towards them. In the distance
there are snow capped mountains.

83df1f02-dd48-499a-9f51-b38afbd3052c-0
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.529
Castle still looks grand. We're
looking at a slightly different

83df1f02-dd48-499a-9f51-b38afbd3052c-1
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.990
angle now.

69150833-4145-4fa3-ac7f-28078a0c3ba9-0
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.360
And then we move over to the
next page from that.

6962ddbd-bd50-4a82-86cb-a0c1b62fd19f-0
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.730
The children seem to be
determined to.

a5c847e1-97c2-4c78-bc32-0e2d7fc9d11a-0
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.550
Do something. Not sure what it
is.

58bb2c6c-73c8-442a-927b-ad71b1d68782-0
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.520
The the bird is on the boy's
shoulder. The purple bird.

63c9e05d-f1fe-4325-b250-27629d5f1483-0
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.960
They said they'd be fist
bumping.

d31983f7-faf9-4e8e-9dfc-3549420be60e-0
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.847
And now they they they found the
flippers somehow, and they've

d31983f7-faf9-4e8e-9dfc-3549420be60e-1
00:31:57.847 --> 00:32:01.843
now left into water. Off into
the water, off the rock, the

d31983f7-faf9-4e8e-9dfc-3549420be60e-2
00:32:01.843 --> 00:32:05.230
Purple Bird has turned into what
looks to be the.

3695a544-b93d-43d3-8a0e-17c5ce90fcfc-0
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.970
Back end of an octopus was
jumped in the water with them.

79dc1a8e-5cf5-4bf9-8c39-17400ebb470b-0
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.760
Would you like me to? Yes,
please. Yeah. OK.

ba8ed3dd-0e98-45b4-b894-b7229049c7cd-0
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.984
OK, it was an octopus was
probably the now swimming down

ba8ed3dd-0e98-45b4-b894-b7229049c7cd-1
00:32:19.984 --> 00:32:23.798
as well as flippers. They now
got Aqua lungs and and and and

ba8ed3dd-0e98-45b4-b894-b7229049c7cd-2
00:32:23.798 --> 00:32:27.425
diving helmets and . They're
being dragged down under the

ba8ed3dd-0e98-45b4-b894-b7229049c7cd-3
00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:31.052
water by this octopus. The
Purple bird is still there. He

ba8ed3dd-0e98-45b4-b894-b7229049c7cd-4
00:32:31.052 --> 00:32:31.990
doesn't have a.

ad2450b4-a347-4fc2-be07-b86f2e66e91b-0
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.570
Purple Bird might have his own
aqualung.

4a5bc292-1f1e-4105-9698-9f4eaef3fb91-0
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:41.274
So all of them are going down,
down, down deep into the ocean

4a5bc292-1f1e-4105-9698-9f4eaef3fb91-1
00:32:41.274 --> 00:32:44.080
where we saw that inset on the
map of the.

b31985ac-d9e7-4737-af1a-96cf6bfd30a9-0
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.320
The Greek.

8a4c5dc2-de2b-4628-8774-206b3e443374-0
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.554
Yeah, temple that's in ruin
underwater there's a shark

8a4c5dc2-de2b-4628-8774-206b3e443374-1
00:32:50.554 --> 00:32:53.910
swimming around, 3 smaller fish,
a tower.

03d761d1-9cbc-431d-b6ec-2188d4271411-0
00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.560
It looks a little bit like the
Roman Colosseum.

3a9284c8-3dd5-44a6-bbd2-022b05674a0c-0
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.173
Surrounding all the buildings
and they're going down towards

3a9284c8-3dd5-44a6-bbd2-022b05674a0c-1
00:33:05.173 --> 00:33:05.460
this.

a9652087-8c0a-42a8-b060-8944a45cfbdd-0
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:08.490
Next.

97fb1f12-2230-4dbd-880d-15a04d3333a3-0
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.970
OK, right they they've arrived
down at the bottom of the.

646347f6-a458-49ed-a14f-eeeee60c24da-0
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.740
Ocean amongst the ruined temple
there are fish swimming. There

646347f6-a458-49ed-a14f-eeeee60c24da-1
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.216
are corals waving in the, in
the, in the, in the, in the, in

646347f6-a458-49ed-a14f-eeeee60c24da-2
00:33:23.216 --> 00:33:26.635
the current bubble. Bird with
his aqua lung is still there,

646347f6-a458-49ed-a14f-eeeee60c24da-3
00:33:26.635 --> 00:33:29.940
which is the good to see.
There's a mermaid to the statue

646347f6-a458-49ed-a14f-eeeee60c24da-4
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.220
holding up part of the ruined
building.

653e5736-b72e-44f8-af0f-e66494c267eb-0
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.680
And the children are going to
towards and have found.

8d39e671-cf0c-4c9b-a06e-e3a3a689a05c-0
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.760
Large seashell on the statue of
Seahorses.

1df2d39c-c0a2-49c1-aa3e-1964f755c3d7-0
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:45.548
And I think that would be the
next clue that if it is, we move

1df2d39c-c0a2-49c1-aa3e-1964f755c3d7-1
00:33:45.548 --> 00:33:46.310
next to the.

37ef61a6-1ae5-47c9-b703-0f68dfdc1ba4-0
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.139
I think the girl child is
tucking something into his

37ef61a6-1ae5-47c9-b703-0f68dfdc1ba4-1
00:33:51.139 --> 00:33:54.774
bandolier. The Boy child has its
map in his left hand and they're

37ef61a6-1ae5-47c9-b703-0f68dfdc1ba4-2
00:33:54.774 --> 00:33:55.380
both being.

26e68d1e-5a42-4447-aa0a-692d061ef9ba-0
00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:00.913
Taken to safety by the purple
octopus with the bird in tow,

26e68d1e-5a42-4447-aa0a-692d061ef9ba-1
00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:03.400
and they're being followed by 6.

816f6f1a-c9f4-418b-b207-b11c1104cf07-0
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.110
Underwater.

7a11199b-d4d1-4688-bf76-b8c7838191a7-0
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:12.155
Spear carrying flipper wearing
guards in pursuit of the of

7a11199b-d4d1-4688-bf76-b8c7838191a7-1
00:34:12.155 --> 00:34:13.000
bubbles.

f83c7084-509f-4b95-ae07-76071b7fe62c-0
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.100
Come and get the no no
background details.

cc5856dd-cd53-4da6-b92d-5732373f84c9-0
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.425
So they're making their escape
until the next bit of the

cc5856dd-cd53-4da6-b92d-5732373f84c9-1
00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:21.330
adventure, I think.

a885882d-8155-4fcd-a56d-fa999822d982-0
00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:27.240
OK, now arriving at a desert
island with palm trees.

32c16c8b-f1be-4039-b5ce-5a59f03cee94-0
00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:31.136
Looks to be desired. The purple
bag is still there, which is

32c16c8b-f1be-4039-b5ce-5a59f03cee94-1
00:34:31.136 --> 00:34:31.360
nice.

7eed7c9e-5121-4c37-8e39-6caee022914c-0
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.840
Possibly clouds, possibly
mountains in the background.

bc8f22dc-49f4-4f16-8beb-33f7a9deea1b-0
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.280
Small island with the larger
island behind it.

13e5a26c-1e39-4730-9b10-3f775203d681-0
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.874
And the the children are making
their way into the island. The,

13e5a26c-1e39-4730-9b10-3f775203d681-1
00:34:44.874 --> 00:34:48.717
the, the, the they're getting
rid of the aqualungs and helmets

13e5a26c-1e39-4730-9b10-3f775203d681-2
00:34:48.717 --> 00:34:51.340
and making their way towards the
interior.

129af026-4463-4193-8795-ebde26d7c43b-0
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.470
Well, now that.

4cbab39e-e60e-4303-9edc-cea43ae1218c-0
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.580
Drawings and being on a.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.010
Plain white background.

38b940fc-6edb-40be-aa7b-152d5b9669bb-0
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.420
Which may be a.

da58e1de-d07f-4d27-9424-8550c69f8867-0
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.050
A hill with a square on it. It
could even be an elephant or a

da58e1de-d07f-4d27-9424-8550c69f8867-1
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:08.200
rhinoceros. I didn't know what
it going to turn out to be. The

da58e1de-d07f-4d27-9424-8550c69f8867-2
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.300
boys still honing its map and
they've got a red, blue crayon.

08a99152-08c0-4564-a4c0-1e0c8b850770-0
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.247
And the gouge out as a red
crayon. Maybe it's crayons that

08a99152-08c0-4564-a4c0-1e0c8b850770-1
00:35:15.247 --> 00:35:17.400
are in his bandelier and I don't
know.

b031f71c-01c1-4217-aeec-7fdbb4eab165-0
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.720
They they're, they're intent on
doing that. And the purple bird

b031f71c-01c1-4217-aeec-7fdbb4eab165-1
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.810
is sitting on the boy's
shoulder, still.

72974b3d-edaf-4197-a6cc-6bf0ede92761-0
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.060
Next. There we go.

ffe0017c-858f-42d6-b8c2-192076fe977f-0
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.290
Now we move to.

840aca77-85ac-44b7-838d-40c9aba01c55-0
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:39.287
Some castellations built into
the side of a hill and purple

840aca77-85ac-44b7-838d-40c9aba01c55-1
00:35:39.287 --> 00:35:41.180
rhinoceros with a.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.834
Howda on its back, which might
have the two children inside it,

9431cd83-0ecf-42b7-b132-88497f7cf44a-1
00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:53.635
and they're going down a pathway
towards the building, through to

9431cd83-0ecf-42b7-b132-88497f7cf44a-2
00:35:53.635 --> 00:35:57.490
statues guarding the entrance.
It was like a jungle.

248d3738-47fa-484d-b0fc-888832f7fa72-0
00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.540
Maybe in the?

af248513-c1cd-42cb-bd54-cf553e2467a3-0
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.926
As tech sort of design of
building in the heading towards

af248513-c1cd-42cb-bd54-cf553e2467a3-1
00:36:05.926 --> 00:36:07.140
this deserted.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.980
Aztecs Temple was staircases
leading up through the pyramid

36b9eba3-6f2b-4db9-bb44-b7a93661c5e6-1

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.160
Building on the next one we see.

6bdfaa10-62f7-4054-ae4f-c2a63482d467-0
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.220
Looking down into the Bay with
the.

f2315392-705f-47ff-be84-a76de305f89b-0
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.463

a Cliff with a rope bridge

00:36:27.463 --> 00:36:29.290
leading to another small.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.460
Birds swimming and flying around
it.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.920

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:54.080
{OK, perfect. So that one is done
and I wanted to know what

59211c60-90f9-49e5-8090-3a477615e722-1
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.950
happened.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:56.890
Actually.

ea4a9d3a-1d40-4b72-8a20-acd50f8aaf4b-0
00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.447
Yep, you still there's another
PowerPoint. So you do get to

ea4a9d3a-1d40-4b72-8a20-acd50f8aaf4b-1
00:37:01.447 --> 00:37:04.270
keep finding out what happened.
I know we get.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.530
Very.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.680
Very interesting. OK, here's
the next one. OK.

b35b91be-8658-4685-a1b7-b0b1370c6903-0
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.840
And let me just.

97eb8b12-3a42-4d03-8943-a81fc4dd2ede-0
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.010
The road bridge.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.750
Ready.}

ebd1ebc2-d0f6-4325-82a1-2acc711adfb7-0
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.776
OK, so we're back
at the road bridge and then,

ebd1ebc2-d0f6-4325-82a1-2acc711adfb7-1
00:37:31.776 --> 00:37:35.477
then, then the children are
running across it, the birds

ebd1ebc2-d0f6-4325-82a1-2acc711adfb7-2
00:37:35.477 --> 00:37:39.243
swarming behind them, and the
purple bird is leading them

ebd1ebc2-d0f6-4325-82a1-2acc711adfb7-3
00:37:39.243 --> 00:37:42.880
across this rather dilapidated
road bridge towards the.

3a077184-43e8-4b8d-a7fb-919477e0d673-0
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.939
Tower constructing sort of as
aztechie tower construction on

3a077184-43e8-4b8d-a7fb-919477e0d673-1
00:37:47.939 --> 00:37:51.791
the bridge goes towards the top
end of the the the top of the

3a077184-43e8-4b8d-a7fb-919477e0d673-2
00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:55.332
tower is illuminated or is a
flame, and the children are

3a077184-43e8-4b8d-a7fb-919477e0d673-3
00:37:55.332 --> 00:37:59.059
running one of them's looking
over its shoulder. Maybe they

3a077184-43e8-4b8d-a7fb-919477e0d673-4
00:37:59.059 --> 00:38:00.240
were being pursued.

d651bc13-41f3-4868-b432-66c77f57afe6-0
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.055
From the from the island and the
the headland behind the old

d651bc13-41f3-4868-b432-66c77f57afe6-1
00:38:05.055 --> 00:38:08.970
Temple they were they were at
towards this new construction.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.500
And.

1e582c9c-e5c7-4b08-a160-101244598e16-0
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.252
Right there at the very top of
the pointy tower, looking back

1e582c9c-e5c7-4b08-a160-101244598e16-1
00:38:21.252 --> 00:38:25.731
where they've come from and are
indeed guards with Spears coming

1e582c9c-e5c7-4b08-a160-101244598e16-2
00:38:25.731 --> 00:38:26.490
across the.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:32.227
Rope bridge there with wooden
slats, some of which are missing

7578d44a-8fc0-4247-a55f-74ac6983b7c5-1
00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:34.010
over the over the ocean.

ecc62851-fe9b-459b-9da2-71099e5a8e81-0
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.046
And there's a waterfall behind
it and the jungle of behind

ecc62851-fe9b-459b-9da2-71099e5a8e81-1
00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:38.330
that.

f93aaa87-6e50-4a24-abb3-18a2f98e5e78-0
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.460
The rope bridge stretches from
the Cliff face.

639d23a3-62f8-4090-8b89-465245ec3630-0
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.970
Towards the tower which has a.

8633d1ce-13a7-4dfc-816a-ab9d117a5c0c-0
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.640
An inscription like the plague
which may be.

fecf9441-8706-4e23-8c7d-799c342bb4fc-0
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.999
Maybe a seashell on it I don't I
do not. Not sure, but both

fecf9441-8706-4e23-8c7d-799c342bb4fc-1
00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.000
children are there.

d229ecea-0452-41a1-865a-7c6f9560b842-0
00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.997
Looking back where they've come
from and the bird is there,

d229ecea-0452-41a1-865a-7c6f9560b842-1
00:39:01.997 --> 00:39:04.680
looking back and seeing the
their pursuers.

cb8eacfd-12e8-47ec-8eb4-7be09143be71-0
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.070
The next page is again is a
blank page.

59ac8a68-0bc5-4ccd-99e6-e8e29b66139e-0
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.182
And the children are drawing on
it, the boys doing a large

59ac8a68-0bc5-4ccd-99e6-e8e29b66139e-1
00:39:15.182 --> 00:39:17.880
drawing, the girl doing a small
one.

04ef7c1c-bfef-42df-8d0a-5c3f486f9cd5-0
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.732
Maybe that drawing the next
stage of their adventure, I

04ef7c1c-bfef-42df-8d0a-5c3f486f9cd5-1
00:39:21.732 --> 00:39:25.034
don't know. The bubble bird is
still sitting on his shoulder,

04ef7c1c-bfef-42df-8d0a-5c3f486f9cd5-2
00:39:25.034 --> 00:39:28.389
the boys drawing with a purple
crayon. The girl's drawing her.

a359e37c-9a9e-46a0-a418-c3fe834fe2d8-0
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.490
Red box with one of her crayons
out of her bandolier.

ca8c32bb-7057-442c-9ea4-a4483c339607-0
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.100
Next.

5f68b31f-ec56-4fbb-b653-3592eda4a109-0
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.381
OK, so now we've got a large
purple dragonfly, which is,

5f68b31f-ec56-4fbb-b653-3592eda4a109-1
00:39:45.381 --> 00:39:50.798
which is got a huge beast, and
it's rescuing the children from

5f68b31f-ec56-4fbb-b653-3592eda4a109-2
00:39:50.798 --> 00:39:54.410
the outstretched grasping
fingers of the.

e3303ad2-5d87-4ed4-87ce-5679a7d55c48-0
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:59.000
God soldiers, one of which you
got to spare. They're trying to

e3303ad2-5d87-4ed4-87ce-5679a7d55c48-1
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.771
grasp the children, but they
can't. They're being whisked

e3303ad2-5d87-4ed4-87ce-5679a7d55c48-2
00:40:01.771 --> 00:40:02.010
away.

88795334-aa48-4657-8260-8f6950278dc3-0
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:07.441
On the end of rope that the
dragonfly is is towing and the

88795334-aa48-4657-8260-8f6950278dc3-1
00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:11.795
children are sitting on what
looks to be a swing attached to

88795334-aa48-4657-8260-8f6950278dc3-2
00:40:11.795 --> 00:40:12.009
it.

db51e5f8-00bf-4b77-8728-34b82c3712da-0
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.773
And the red, the the purple bird
is still there, sitting on the

db51e5f8-00bf-4b77-8728-34b82c3712da-1
00:40:15.773 --> 00:40:16.480
boy's shoulder.

d5bedd2d-22b9-4308-a949-8f2b4d04ad7f-0
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.780
In the distance of the far
distance, in the background in

d5bedd2d-22b9-4308-a949-8f2b4d04ad7f-1
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:24.463
the sky are three balloons with
with guards in them, little

d5bedd2d-22b9-4308-a949-8f2b4d04ad7f-2
00:40:24.463 --> 00:40:25.630
dirigible balloons.

e7fef40b-1a64-4af1-b8a2-69e481b7128f-0
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:31.173
And we have a mountain scene in
the distance with snowy capped

e7fef40b-1a64-4af1-b8a2-69e481b7128f-1
00:40:31.173 --> 00:40:35.880
mountains and conifer trees,
then the edges of the slopes and

e7fef40b-1a64-4af1-b8a2-69e481b7128f-2
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.664
the water crashing against the
the lower reaches of the of the

e7fef40b-1a64-4af1-b8a2-69e481b7128f-3
00:40:40.664 --> 00:40:41.120
hills.

97dff9a9-1b31-4ac6-8b0c-37d9d027a5b2-0
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:43.570
Yep.

6930e37c-fd39-446d-a779-cc17fb34494d-0
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:52.940
OK, so now they're being dropped
off the leaping off the swing.

f676e177-e119-4ed1-8556-c597be90be99-0
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.470
Dragonflies flying away. It
seems to be snowing now and

f676e177-e119-4ed1-8556-c597be90be99-1
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.260
there at the top of the
mountain, presumably one of the

f676e177-e119-4ed1-8556-c597be90be99-2
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.349
mountains we could see in the
distance and the previous page.

0f003cf8-c2e6-417c-98a7-190a477d4df6-0
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.530
The snow falling in the dark,
lowering the sky.

6bf6f434-d621-46ba-984f-4a542d3b77bc-0
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.258

hot air balloons attached to
them and there are guards with

8374d32b-fb4c-49f0-bc4b-2c6dca36465e-1
00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.350
Spears.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.510
Coming towards them the.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.542
It's a ornamental statue atop
this mountain when the children

06d1bf67-cacf-4d59-a1e6-7a01ea99d906-1
00:41:28.542 --> 00:41:31.870
have been dropped off at the
very top of that and there's a.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.994
Figure or or or or or or
sculpture. The main part of this

0a317e31-c0a5-4b9f-845c-a35c8916abd2-1
00:41:39.994 --> 00:41:42.000
this this building on top.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:47.128
Purple. Purple bone is still
there. That's good. Lots of

0f4d2431-4e11-46c5-a8d0-1e5d6ff674ac-1

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.702
Flying around in the background
too. Then we get a close up of

c35cfd79-7093-42c0-9021-08e86db054e1-1
00:41:52.702 --> 00:41:56.335

looking quite pleased with
itself. The boy child holding

The purple bird with the long
tail is still there maybe.

5aff1afb-2294-4e3a-8370-c727263a2d3a-0
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.530

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:46.152
hot air bags above them, keeping
them afloat. There's got four

bb6eb409-e2e2-47a8-8edd-3db50467eddc-1
00:42:46.152 --> 00:42:49.214
men in each one, though one of
them looks to be a king. He's

bb6eb409-e2e2-47a8-8edd-3db50467eddc-2
00:42:49.214 --> 00:42:50.720
got a beard and a crown and a.

d523baab-ae6d-4c1a-8c15-611b05c2f6cd-0
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.800
Goldens or the tunic?

a787241f-64e0-4907-a2c4-c2f0ecd42cba-0
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.010
And there are men with Spears.

103abf0d-5b0f-4079-bbc9-f8b292d111d9-0
00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:01.448
And the leaning out to grasp the
purple bird which is flying away

103abf0d-5b0f-4079-bbc9-f8b292d111d9-1
00:43:01.448 --> 00:43:01.810
with.

79f0ee83-c901-43fd-bdec-ac69b8fb1808-0
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.529
Something I can't identify in,
it's only in. In his talons this

79f0ee83-c901-43fd-bdec-ac69b8fb1808-1
00:43:06.529 --> 00:43:07.350
seems to be a.

9a27cf20-c064-476b-923e-a9b0ce5e9d15-0
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.780
Shiny thing. It's the girl's
bandelier, that's what it is.

9a27cf20-c064-476b-923e-a9b0ce5e9d15-1
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.752
It's flying away with that, and
the guard has a golden cage to

9a27cf20-c064-476b-923e-a9b0ce5e9d15-2
00:43:15.752 --> 00:43:17.769
capture the bird and capture it.

891a9292-39d7-467c-bced-54b655919d74-0
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.650
I think it'll probably escape.

a76c7355-8603-4a6d-905d-6562e9fd8198-0
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.385
And the next page shows a closer
view of one of these flying

a76c7355-8603-4a6d-905d-6562e9fd8198-1
00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:31.411
machines with its spear carrying
guards in the metal uniforms

a76c7355-8603-4a6d-905d-6562e9fd8198-2
00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:33.600
that the armour to smaller.

d5af7a17-7020-4eb5-ae54-7fb811ddb395-0
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.984
Flying machines in the
background. No evidence of

d5af7a17-7020-4eb5-ae54-7fb811ddb395-1
00:43:36.984 --> 00:43:38.110
children in this next one.

7a69ecdd-ffc8-4a33-85a6-3114fd27ee4b-0
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.670
Maybe they've escaped, but there
is snow

404268ba-78b2-4d68-a53b-4585de6cb783-0
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.000
Falling in the distant mountains
and the high fells behind.

76ded34e-7a78-4379-b3f5-227f64ae4750-0
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.620
Yeah, now we got a Rainbow day.

fee69c38-de9f-4532-ada2-04128e1604bc-0
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.490
The rainbow is easy.

4e1eda34-6f0f-4935-9bae-e5dd5b47af96-0
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.334
So the rainbow seems to be
emanating from the purple bird

4e1eda34-6f0f-4935-9bae-e5dd5b47af96-1
00:44:02.334 --> 00:44:06.343
as he as he flies away and he's
coming back and hitting the top

4e1eda34-6f0f-4935-9bae-e5dd5b47af96-2
00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:09.790
of the the the tower structure
where the children are.

81e4a52b-80c3-4669-8ec8-8e2760f3f834-0
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:15.103
Holding on, it looks a bit like
a beehive, but it's now it's.

81e4a52b-80c3-4669-8ec8-8e2760f3f834-1
00:44:15.103 --> 00:44:18.100
It's illuminated by the by the
rainbow.

d6eaa06f-2f56-436e-8155-8a6e0e71acee-0
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.699
Just as the flying machine with
his fellow with a crown on his

d6eaa06f-2f56-436e-8155-8a6e0e71acee-1
00:44:24.699 --> 00:44:29.500
head is freaking his fist at the
escaping Purple bird.

e59436a2-7d38-438c-9f3b-dfd1063e3862-0
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:35.970
And the other thing we see the
the castle in the background

e59436a2-7d38-438c-9f3b-dfd1063e3862-1
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.690
what where their ships came out
of and.

9618e275-437f-432e-83ed-463b07adcec5-0
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.931
We see also that the man that
the flying machine where the

9618e275-437f-432e-83ed-463b07adcec5-1
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:47.572
fellow had a golden cage to
capture the purple bird in that

9618e275-437f-432e-83ed-463b07adcec5-2
00:44:47.572 --> 00:44:50.607
now has crashed and has
plummeted, all the ground

9618e275-437f-432e-83ed-463b07adcec5-3
00:44:50.607 --> 00:44:54.128
plummeting towards the ground
and the three soldiers have

9618e275-437f-432e-83ed-463b07adcec5-4
00:44:54.128 --> 00:44:55.160
fallen out of it.

ad49db03-ade5-4f5a-b843-a5a24724ddb8-0
00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.320
The children seem to be safe and
smiling and.

54df4361-56d9-450b-8651-23c3af9475c6-0
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.750
Ready for the next page?

4faab764-41e0-44c2-9a4c-ba11eb57fa6d-0
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.000
OK.

ff0b01fe-75ae-4814-8bec-7b8b0bb9e5b4-0
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.702
There we go. OK, right, more
rainbows. So we see the other

ff0b01fe-75ae-4814-8bec-7b8b0bb9e5b4-1
00:45:09.702 --> 00:45:13.820
end of the rainbow. Now we see
the top left of the image. We

ff0b01fe-75ae-4814-8bec-7b8b0bb9e5b4-2
00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.330
see the rainbow hitting the
children on top of the.

23759352-8eab-429b-994d-cdd8b220c633-0
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.370
The the the mountain with the
with the towers, the sculpture.

4f91ae22-d691-405d-a53a-d54ed7c627e9-0
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:29.024
And the other end we did the
most of the castle. Now the

4f91ae22-d691-405d-a53a-d54ed7c627e9-1
00:45:29.024 --> 00:45:32.710
other end of the rainbow is
illuminating a.

69992688-c899-46ca-ba69-524fc2265e0c-0
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.970
Saving the pad paddle boat,
which seems to have.

91e3efca-32a2-4b87-be94-4f3759446420-0
00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:42.160
Normal non soldier people on
board but.

b23648cf-84a5-46e0-8d76-c43fc52f35c8-0
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.560
Against that, the purple bird
with the Bandelier in his grasp.

11123444-1e20-4528-a018-aad718cd2e32-0
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.690
Is the either.

494a2b36-5127-4815-9d5c-42bf481c7143-0
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:57.010
Caused cause the the sailing the
flying boat to a crash next to

494a2b36-5127-4815-9d5c-42bf481c7143-1
00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:01.968
this paddle boat and there's
someone holding up his hands

494a2b36-5127-4815-9d5c-42bf481c7143-2
00:46:01.968 --> 00:46:02.310
and.

e9b9d6bf-feb8-4614-bfc7-03985da62c30-0
00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.319
Wonderment or supplication to
the to the rainbow and the

e9b9d6bf-feb8-4614-bfc7-03985da62c30-1
00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:10.000
children at the other end of it.
The silver boat on the aqueduct.

a0343d9a-011d-41ce-aea5-6d3419a3e2f8-0
00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.190
And.

2ed6118f-36ea-48e5-bb50-6620913cbd46-0
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.190
People falling from the sky all
over.

a49c04e4-ba44-4b78-a23a-9be16b1cad71-0
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.300
In in both images.

51a4f3e4-6945-4b6c-9800-a43e9fc5a291-0
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.946
But everyone seems quite happy
in the paddle boat. Is is part

51a4f3e4-6945-4b6c-9800-a43e9fc5a291-1
00:46:23.946 --> 00:46:25.820
of the entertainment of
Disneyland.

ec39fa02-0d4d-4fbf-a5f6-a3495a2807d2-0
00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.160
Next.

157f388e-18ff-4935-a836-345c26e5b796-0
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.030
Alright.

f9d91f8b-d133-4aea-b7d7-726176b1e652-0
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.110
So he was. A double page spread
of the scene is the castle with

f9d91f8b-d133-4aea-b7d7-726176b1e652-1
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:40.669
a rainbow superimposed above it.
Lots of people looking at people

f9d91f8b-d133-4aea-b7d7-726176b1e652-2
00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:44.675
on window ledges. The Purple
bird is in the middle of the

f9d91f8b-d133-4aea-b7d7-726176b1e652-3
00:46:44.675 --> 00:46:48.060
tree, flying around. Can't see
the children yet.

314d9b58-8084-4199-8643-d52d4013c56d-0
00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.627
The purple dragonfly is that
everyone seems to be happy and

314d9b58-8084-4199-8643-d52d4013c56d-1
00:46:52.627 --> 00:46:55.816
jolly. There's a purple
rhinoceros. The children are in

314d9b58-8084-4199-8643-d52d4013c56d-2
00:46:55.816 --> 00:46:57.810
the back of the purple
rhinoceros.

dbb14530-9485-4d6f-9bd8-ba8f30011d0a-0
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.570
The some sort of procession it
looks like.

30a6dc22-b383-4a1c-8ad2-da23a7ca6017-0
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.236
I can see the end of it. Maybe
the purple octopus is there in

30a6dc22-b383-4a1c-8ad2-da23a7ca6017-1
00:47:09.236 --> 00:47:10.930
the in the in the, in the Moat.

76bf7eda-02c2-42fe-8df3-99b0b74d420c-0
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.640
That someone playing a band.

49377166-8c7e-4393-b4df-94daa0072993-0
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.673
Whatever has happened has been a
good thing and they're all

49377166-8c7e-4393-b4df-94daa0072993-1
00:47:19.673 --> 00:47:20.700
celebrating it there.

b7e5fa59-3827-4f57-89e7-d938f3bb2ea4-0
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:26.092
The procession is going off
stage right till the next next

b7e5fa59-3827-4f57-89e7-d938f3bb2ea4-1
00:47:26.092 --> 00:47:27.630
part of the adventure.

858c5982-faaa-4c30-b5d8-7224ec58cc43-0
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.800
Where we see the wizard.

f53c2261-527e-42b5-9c9f-338dfa3f8017-0
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.800
Be that he is.

c8ffa338-9459-45a0-91d9-4d104bf4b8f1-0
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.310
The.

bd2a5067-7069-4856-a107-18288b1215c3-0
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.850
Purple octopus, the purple
rhinoceros, the purple bird, the

bd2a5067-7069-4856-a107-18288b1215c3-1
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:46.450
purple dragonfly, the children
all gathered all heavy. All.

f4deefb4-dcd2-4ea9-b26a-34b4f682d47e-0
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.064
Whatever the mission was,
they've accomplished it and

f4deefb4-dcd2-4ea9-b26a-34b4f682d47e-1
00:47:50.064 --> 00:47:51.290
they're very happy about it.

3728ce72-1dac-4c91-b96c-b0ca11c12d7d-0
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:58.013
Do like the purple rhinoceros
and then the next phase we see

3728ce72-1dac-4c91-b96c-b0ca11c12d7d-1
00:47:58.013 --> 00:48:02.346
the king or the wizard rather
waving goodbye to the children,

3728ce72-1dac-4c91-b96c-b0ca11c12d7d-2
00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:06.120
crowning the boy child. Go
crowning both of them and.

94e94dc9-08b6-4a49-b425-df158807d60e-0
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.877
Thanking them for their help and
assistance, they're going back

94e94dc9-08b6-4a49-b425-df158807d60e-1
00:48:10.877 --> 00:48:12.930
through the magic door that they
came.

2ca14055-d1c4-4883-8075-f0a079829fe6-0
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.990
They went into earlier on.

71dd5de4-e039-4af1-80be-da1793e1a266-0
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.657
So I think their adventure is
done. I think the purple bird is

71dd5de4-e039-4af1-80be-da1793e1a266-1
00:48:19.657 --> 00:48:20.770
going with them though.

58fb3229-d17c-4006-abdb-f2efa36db5c9-0
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.454
And indeed, that's it. Yes,
they're coming out through the,

58fb3229-d17c-4006-abdb-f2efa36db5c9-1
00:48:28.454 --> 00:48:31.130
through the magic doors, under
the, under the.

e3382b36-c197-49c0-a20b-c21bdae92303-0
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.330
Under the bridge and looking
there was a cityscape.

1450b833-eb62-4e25-93f9-8882a936a5ab-0
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.195
Park City Park. Looking at the
skyscrapers in the distance,

1450b833-eb62-4e25-93f9-8882a936a5ab-1
00:48:40.195 --> 00:48:44.223
Purple Bird has come with them,
with the children. They're back

1450b833-eb62-4e25-93f9-8882a936a5ab-2
00:48:44.223 --> 00:48:47.810
in the real world but still
wearing their golden crowns.

a394ae3f-26be-4ac3-9d49-37991f434853-0
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.100
The end of, I think. #END_quest 

6084f4c3-cb33-40a7-a8db-c96d0b3bcb3c-0
00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.840
Yeah, you do, you lovely.

4d81a019-9b83-43f6-86a5-adf24362418f-0
00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.570
Let's see what's next.

08ba5435-3f9c-4083-acf3-1b9450f495d8-0
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.320
Ohh let me download it.

85a4f99e-e9c4-41a8-bc95-84c1164245bb-0
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.137
So, so while that's
downloading, I mean is this the

85a4f99e-e9c4-41a8-bc95-84c1164245bb-1
00:49:20.137 --> 00:49:23.430
idea that you have someone with
aphasia to?

648c2067-1599-48d4-9065-b77d5fc15aa7-0
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:29.004
Do what I've just done and then
see what the disparity is

648c2067-1599-48d4-9065-b77d5fc15aa7-1
00:49:29.004 --> 00:49:32.970
between A and. See like what
kind of words yeah, we're

648c2067-1599-48d4-9065-b77d5fc15aa7-2
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:37.296
looking at just like like we
said before, just want to make

648c2067-1599-48d4-9065-b77d5fc15aa7-3
00:49:37.296 --> 00:49:38.090
sure that.

b6263711-9048-428f-b178-542eaa4ff28e-0
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:39.590


024d6f5c-302b-4515-8a26-79339c56fa8b-0
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.310
Like we were saying before,
just to see what.

744bfef5-9cea-4376-8091-e07d62772184-0
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.440


af44577b-ba83-4d8b-9543-dfb705d9d291-0
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.759
Neurotypical people are saying
and then just comparing it and

af44577b-ba83-4d8b-9543-dfb705d9d291-1
00:49:56.759 --> 00:50:00.473
seeing. So we're trying to make
a naming discourse treatment. So

af44577b-ba83-4d8b-9543-dfb705d9d291-2
00:50:00.473 --> 00:50:04.015
the idea is that we use these
same stories that we're showing

af44577b-ba83-4d8b-9543-dfb705d9d291-3
00:50:04.015 --> 00:50:07.614
you and we use them as part of
treatment. So we're just seeing

af44577b-ba83-4d8b-9543-dfb705d9d291-4
00:50:07.614 --> 00:50:11.100
what words come up the most, see
what we're we're training.

ff92483a-3ac1-44b4-84fe-2afe5f4a914f-0
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:13.970
Interesting, interesting.

a8e90f74-6a21-4130-9e4c-42fa88dd43f4-0
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.470
So next we have.

ca920a7a-559c-49d0-8c6a-d327e8bc67c9-0
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.170
OK.

8e2d4604-656b-4fc7-8502-27cd3cd00a7d-0
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.860
Well, I have to go into this
locker.

32ebb4d2-4f5d-42d5-9eb9-9e7fe32c5a75-0
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.160
OK, download.

3c6f634d-b0c3-4d93-bdd4-685006acd703-0
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.870
This one is also really pretty
well done.

58a0a629-229c-4872-90f7-39fb1a132907-0
00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.390
This is the same author, isn't
it?

8ef919d8-967f-4013-81c3-ca3977e64d37-0
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:04.430
I think, yeah, I think this is
the same author.

0cace873-ac6c-4c07-97b4-a757dc4f16cb-0
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.941
So like like the other ones
we've had so far, just a short

0cace873-ac6c-4c07-97b4-a757dc4f16cb-1
00:51:10.941 --> 00:51:13.480
story. So just describe what you
see.

e1dfb238-9d88-41ee-8332-89acb263c111-0
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.646
#START_return Well, we got a
double page spread. It looks to

e1dfb238-9d88-41ee-8332-89acb263c111-1
00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:18.850
be a.

177c295e-022f-4e23-a822-b4257042fc62-0
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.120
Cut through all the buildings,
showing the rooms within,

177c295e-022f-4e23-a822-b4257042fc62-1
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.840
exposing the rooms within a.

172e0fb6-783a-48f8-ab24-7ab2e911072d-0
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.330
City building.

d4f377be-9dac-432d-869a-447bc4762574-0
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.248
The traffic light on red on the
left hand side and a one way

d4f377be-9dac-432d-869a-447bc4762574-1
00:51:33.248 --> 00:51:34.100
street sign.

0cbc0e80-7bef-4d14-932a-2b5ae545698c-0
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:39.543
And some distant buildings in
silhouette in the background.

0cbc0e80-7bef-4d14-932a-2b5ae545698c-1
00:51:39.543 --> 00:51:42.180
We're looking inside this
building.

12c9af15-a1e0-4375-a01d-7b2367fc0ff9-0
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.809
Where we have a an architect,
perhaps a draftsman, in his

12c9af15-a1e0-4375-a01d-7b2367fc0ff9-1
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:52.288
room, working hard at his desk
with a lamp illuminating his

12c9af15-a1e0-4375-a01d-7b2367fc0ff9-2
00:51:52.288 --> 00:51:56.692
his, his angle table he's
working on. He's wearing shorts,

12c9af15-a1e0-4375-a01d-7b2367fc0ff9-3
00:51:56.692 --> 00:52:00.350
and there's a kite flying in
through the window.

837ab335-6849-4195-900c-700203aef688-0
00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:04.639
The next room is a hallway.
There's a staircase coming up

837ab335-6849-4195-900c-700203aef688-1
00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:05.940
from the ground floor.

93dbb31d-9fda-4477-9a73-0b0a7c25b263-0
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.974
To this landing area there are
pictures on the walls. Comfy

93dbb31d-9fda-4477-9a73-0b0a7c25b263-1
00:52:10.974 --> 00:52:11.380
chair.

e7c0b7ca-60eb-481a-8873-ab363c41a91d-0
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:17.338
And in the next room or that,
yeah, in the next room, there's

e7c0b7ca-60eb-481a-8873-ab363c41a91d-1
00:52:17.338 --> 00:52:19.020
a cat, asleep on her bed.

11e8f6e6-41f3-41e2-931c-b1e5a28bddfc-0
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:23.884
The only thing in the room. I
can't see what's behind that.

11e8f6e6-41f3-41e2-931c-b1e5a28bddfc-1
00:52:23.884 --> 00:52:25.390
Hang on, let me move the.

beb47ed7-1607-42e4-aafd-ad07d81d4c82-0
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.120
There you go. Ohh and and and
and and the bathroom.

f5d372fe-ba5e-4bfd-9766-ce06f5bca984-0
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:36.199
Off behind that, nothing
exciting happening in the on the

f5d372fe-ba5e-4bfd-9766-ce06f5bca984-1
00:52:36.199 --> 00:52:37.680
ground floor we have.

baad92eb-f948-4d0c-9160-2158403323d7-0
00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.280
An entrance where he's showing
the.

e3c42238-2e61-42aa-92b5-131908805fee-0
00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.630
Bottom of this cell is two sets
of stairs.

e138b4b5-1617-4dda-a1f5-dd1bac44f6f9-0
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.828
Anyway, there's an old. It seems
to be very old fashioned sort of

e138b4b5-1617-4dda-a1f5-dd1bac44f6f9-1
00:52:49.828 --> 00:52:50.370
building.

ba6bab91-ee3e-4456-96f8-ae70719c1fa0-0
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.143
A coat stand with a cap on tops
and little pictures on the wall.

ba6bab91-ee3e-4456-96f8-ae70719c1fa0-1
00:52:56.143 --> 00:52:59.250
Hideous wallpaper. And then
there's a kitchen with.

9bc9263b-9d09-4893-b208-4b9c8f5e07b5-0
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:05.400
Cupboards and things on top and
the sink drawers and a stove.

b3f34cdc-df58-4d9d-a893-fc5828392e94-0
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:09.952
More stairs. It could be this
could be the servants back

b3f34cdc-df58-4d9d-a893-fc5828392e94-1
00:53:09.952 --> 00:53:12.240
stairs going up to the first
floor.

69f251a4-9e49-4e1d-8535-bc1e5b5be0f7-0
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.464
And another bedroom on the
ground floor, bedroom where we

69f251a4-9e49-4e1d-8535-bc1e5b5be0f7-1
00:53:16.464 --> 00:53:17.870
have a map on the wall.

68315e03-b6e2-4119-a138-270ee53f0686-0
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.602
And the window and a bed. And
the boy with a with a crown on

68315e03-b6e2-4119-a138-270ee53f0686-1
00:53:22.602 --> 00:53:26.797
his head. Whether it's the same
boy from the previous story, I

68315e03-b6e2-4119-a138-270ee53f0686-2
00:53:26.797 --> 00:53:27.730
hope so. He's.

80957e52-254b-4534-b004-327436225b99-0
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:33.250
Drawing a doorway onto the wall
with a red crayon. There's also

80957e52-254b-4534-b004-327436225b99-1
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:38.011
a basement area underneath where
the central heating system is,

80957e52-254b-4534-b004-327436225b99-2
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:38.830
presumably.

49e57e5c-9e8e-43cc-965a-3ed73dca1631-0
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.710
When I was speaking, the boy
with the crown his.

87c8b8b9-96cc-4137-a3bd-daad381214c5-0
00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:46.170
Drawing a portal into the next
stage of the adventure.

d341967d-b849-42aa-a3a1-2f320d708c5a-0
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:49.170
OK.

676fc434-9916-4f96-9f4c-bf7a01266827-0
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:58.845
So we see the architect looking
over his shoulder from working

676fc434-9916-4f96-9f4c-bf7a01266827-1
00:53:58.845 --> 00:54:03.289
at his drafting desk, and
there's a kite that we mentioned

676fc434-9916-4f96-9f4c-bf7a01266827-2
00:54:03.289 --> 00:54:08.109
earlier is now on the floor. So
he gets off his chair, goes and

676fc434-9916-4f96-9f4c-bf7a01266827-3
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:12.252
picks up the kite and he's
pondering, why is this kite

676fc434-9916-4f96-9f4c-bf7a01266827-4
00:54:12.252 --> 00:54:16.997
here? And then we see that he's
gone, he's left the image, the

676fc434-9916-4f96-9f4c-bf7a01266827-5
00:54:16.997 --> 00:54:21.140
kite remains, his chair remains,
and his desk remains.

6cfbab73-1452-40be-9a7d-42a997972b3b-0
00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.590
With the architect, draftsman
has gone.

46f30e20-8f38-4baf-badd-56d59d4d0bd4-0
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.610
We see him now.

cae92f9a-9a90-49b5-9967-1e27fdf49bad-0
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:31.764
Looking through a doorway with a
red door, which appears to be

cae92f9a-9a90-49b5-9967-1e27fdf49bad-1
00:54:31.764 --> 00:54:35.548
the room that the boy was
drawing. Doorway on the wall

cae92f9a-9a90-49b5-9967-1e27fdf49bad-2
00:54:35.548 --> 00:54:39.676
earlier because there's a map of
the world on the wall on a

cae92f9a-9a90-49b5-9967-1e27fdf49bad-3
00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:41.739
window looking at on the city.

b0ae8e7a-a8fa-49ba-a0af-a7e6e7c39e14-0
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:48.286
withThe a man  the beard is now
bend over so he can look through

b0ae8e7a-a8fa-49ba-a0af-a7e6e7c39e14-1
00:54:48.286 --> 00:54:52.320
the now open doorway into the
the next page.

edac1299-335f-44b3-a77b-3d73bfb48ad1-0
00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.490
Which is a.

f6bcecd9-b90c-45fb-8a95-d813d8a7650a-0
00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.974
Forests sort of setting with
those stream throwing through

f6bcecd9-b90c-45fb-8a95-d813d8a7650a-1
00:55:05.974 --> 00:55:08.870
the middle with a with a with a
landing pier.

166a7872-f156-4d32-ba71-06b2f4d855f5-0
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:11.440
And the doorway?

734a107e-6ff4-4092-b35b-4c6e2315abde-0
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.297
Opens up, opens out from the
base of a tree, so he's left a

734a107e-6ff4-4092-b35b-4c6e2315abde-1
00:55:16.297 --> 00:55:20.038
room inside. The tree has come
out into the forest. He's

734a107e-6ff4-4092-b35b-4c6e2315abde-2
00:55:20.038 --> 00:55:24.370
looking pretty startled by this.
He's wearing his pair of shorts.

679fa6a2-1b09-4cc3-9079-c8e5f3b32c03-0
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:25.990
And there are.

11274d67-c9dd-4694-bc47-20c7f06caaf0-0
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:31.420
Lamps, lanterns hanging from the
trees and the string of lights.

b184cff6-895f-4af1-9841-9e813506f85b-0
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:33.880
Like Christmas decorations?

39260765-ad88-4a81-96e5-df2cf6cb7a0e-0
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:38.420

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.620
Ball. Perhaps it's a ball. I
don't know.

eb2ab5f8-3833-42f3-9211-f2a15ca2ce43-0
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.940
With with he's, guiding his arm
on to the next page.

dde3627f-c03b-4b05-9374-2f03da290f94-0
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.717
Well, it is a ball the the, the
the fellow was picked up the

dde3627f-c03b-4b05-9374-2f03da290f94-1
00:55:55.717 --> 00:55:55.980
ball.

f87fc4fb-f282-4c2d-af69-40ccaa4924fe-0
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.471
Standing the edges, the edges
here, and it's a small river or

f87fc4fb-f282-4c2d-af69-40ccaa4924fe-1
00:56:02.471 --> 00:56:06.689
stream, it seems to be man-made,
coming through the trees, and

f87fc4fb-f282-4c2d-af69-40ccaa4924fe-2
00:56:06.689 --> 00:56:10.706
there are still the the lanterns
hanging from the trees and

f87fc4fb-f282-4c2d-af69-40ccaa4924fe-3
00:56:10.706 --> 00:56:13.720
there's a boat is coming along
with it as a.

c6095ea9-6e32-407d-87f7-e7668bb494bc-0
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:19.586
Carved figurehead of a not just
entirely sure what it is. It's

c6095ea9-6e32-407d-87f7-e7668bb494bc-1
00:56:19.586 --> 00:56:23.965
got big ears and long nose and
it's empty and it's coming

c6095ea9-6e32-407d-87f7-e7668bb494bc-2
00:56:23.965 --> 00:56:26.230
towards the man with the ball.

617dd330-8cad-4129-ac7b-d285bc38dcbe-0
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:29.220
Who?

f4bc13c1-ea4c-4ac1-ac5c-35dbe8571e0e-0
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.130
Jumps aboard.

4435d48b-a1ad-4a8e-aeed-4866838e81ca-0
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.610
And the boat?

a4b822f8-36fb-4180-8885-8f44582f356e-0
00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:39.228
Takes him away towards the next
page. He's holding the ball and

a4b822f8-36fb-4180-8885-8f44582f356e-1
00:56:39.228 --> 00:56:39.610
he's.

0319f39f-5e38-4153-9759-8e6dbe5b08f8-0
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:43.130
Now arrived at the.

483e2ee5-d1e1-4e7d-a25e-35ba4a09a770-0
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.194
It looks like the castle we had
in the previous story. He's

483e2ee5-d1e1-4e7d-a25e-35ba4a09a770-1
00:56:48.194 --> 00:56:51.943
arrived at the castle along the
Moat that we had before. It's a

483e2ee5-d1e1-4e7d-a25e-35ba4a09a770-2
00:56:51.943 --> 00:56:55.575
paddle boat. There's some sort
of cog mechanism. He's got the

483e2ee5-d1e1-4e7d-a25e-35ba4a09a770-3
00:56:55.575 --> 00:56:59.207
ball under his left arm and he's
peering, shielding his eyes,

483e2ee5-d1e1-4e7d-a25e-35ba4a09a770-4
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:00.320
looking up at this.

ff2ee178-b7bd-4000-bddb-7ee530103713-0
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:04.740
Magnificent castle city with
towers and.

fa3aba8f-a792-4fde-ab5f-e638f98a48a0-0
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.250
Flags no people in evidence.

a4c5c63e-25d6-46c1-8a89-bcc1f28dc0dc-0
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:15.430
Then we see he now goes from
that moat like thing. He's now

a4c5c63e-25d6-46c1-8a89-bcc1f28dc0dc-1
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:20.676
above and he's on an aqua the
aqueduct, getting further into

a4c5c63e-25d6-46c1-8a89-bcc1f28dc0dc-2
00:57:20.676 --> 00:57:21.450
the city.

63a8fc09-cb4c-4ac2-bebc-f946592d94d4-0
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:23.140
The moon is.

f242e380-1cf2-4f49-a513-44e2b24f66ca-0
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.750
Full and there are stars, and
the moon is reflected off the.

d7232033-b13f-4e12-9d6c-3e5360a0de0a-0
00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:29.840
Of the wider Moat.

ff863d37-bfab-4305-9d72-b010d93412e7-0
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.015
Says as he goes further into the
city. There's a there's an

ff863d37-bfab-4305-9d72-b010d93412e7-1
00:57:34.015 --> 00:57:37.215
illuminated pagoda sort of
building that he might be going

ff863d37-bfab-4305-9d72-b010d93412e7-2
00:57:37.215 --> 00:57:37.649
towards.

3929880c-850e-4242-bd93-e5af09f1cbb9-0
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:46.690
Right, well, he leaps off the
boat now, waving.

b06b58a9-1176-4394-8b76-36f48faf2171-0
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.680
I left the Red Ball behind.

e193d2db-62f3-4a75-ad4d-4af4c7668b14-0
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:56.019
And there are people around and
and watching the band there with

e193d2db-62f3-4a75-ad4d-4af4c7668b14-1
00:57:56.019 --> 00:58:01.030
trumpets and in the band, band
band players in in uniform.

c97e42ee-3efb-4057-a601-63033149d4f5-0
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:06.161
And he's running towards the
illuminated pagoda, where there

c97e42ee-3efb-4057-a601-63033149d4f5-1
00:58:06.161 --> 00:58:10.749

And the king and the small boy,

c97e42ee-3efb-4057-a601-63033149d4f5-2
00:58:10.749 --> 00:58:15.263
possibly the the girl child and
the boy child. The girl child

c97e42ee-3efb-4057-a601-63033149d4f5-3
00:58:15.263 --> 00:58:16.720
may well be wearing.

81e35e4c-ef72-441c-bfe6-713611d668f3-0
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.730
Golden crowns.

2e35e0b4-5ad9-457a-8247-ced583c52a87-0
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.933
We move on to the next page
where the king oh, no, no, no,

2e35e0b4-5ad9-457a-8247-ced583c52a87-1
00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.050
sorry, go back.

b3e776cb-ac58-4cef-98f8-cc9e6381173c-0
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:30.231
The the next page of those two
and the king is the greeting

b3e776cb-ac58-4cef-98f8-cc9e6381173c-1
00:58:30.231 --> 00:58:33.798
the, the, the, the the bearded
man who may have been an

b3e776cb-ac58-4cef-98f8-cc9e6381173c-2
00:58:33.798 --> 00:58:34.690

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.240
Looking at it.

26e12536-c815-4f1e-a58e-2af5d7f5a6bc-0
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.830
Double seated throne or triple
seated throne.

0d6b0245-fc59-4650-a005-d9d02231e75b-0
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:45.257
the girl child crossed its arms
and it seems to be saying no,

0d6b0245-fc59-4650-a005-d9d02231e75b-1
00:58:45.257 --> 00:58:49.064
and the boy child is looking a
little bit upset about life. The

0d6b0245-fc59-4650-a005-d9d02231e75b-2
00:58:49.064 --> 00:58:52.692
king is bearded with the Golden
crown. Only the two children

0d6b0245-fc59-4650-a005-d9d02231e75b-3
00:58:52.692 --> 00:58:54.120
have golden crowns also.

cec6daa6-8aa1-4939-b873-5468859f2003-0
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.468
The king is now wearing the
bandolier with the crayons stuck

cec6daa6-8aa1-4939-b873-5468859f2003-1
00:58:58.468 --> 00:58:58.950
into it.

1c51ee2a-88aa-4cc9-b640-56fd4912956d-0

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:07.422
Coming towards them. Not
entirely sure what his

21025568-e6b6-4bc4-9f21-0886e4c9193b-1
00:59:07.422 --> 00:59:11.038

page.

520953be-b16d-41c6-bcac-c49f993c2ecc-0
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:18.288
Whether all the king, the two
children, the bearded man on a

520953be-b16d-41c6-bcac-c49f993c2ecc-1
00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:22.480
looking back towards the city,
the castle city, where there's.

e749aa01-650b-4086-a93c-a07086557560-0
00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:28.150
That was all a great journal man
type creature.

c69a6179-bb9b-4fd4-b3dc-46297ff37af6-0
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.682
Coming towards them and he's
getting off the boat, almost

c69a6179-bb9b-4fd4-b3dc-46297ff37af6-1
00:59:32.682 --> 00:59:33.190
robotic.

3d85b645-cd6d-4b9a-8cb1-e7d7fc059a04-0
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:37.536
tAnd the paddle boa is still
there. There are stars out at

3d85b645-cd6d-4b9a-8cb1-e7d7fc059a04-1
00:59:37.536 --> 00:59:38.160
night and.

f7865af6-c153-49d5-8752-9d4b2f0301b7-0
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:43.500
Then we see that there are a
whole number of armed.

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-0
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.821
Soldiers coming out of the front
end of the boat that the boy

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-1
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:53.522
with the bearded man was on, and
it's something like a Trojan

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-2
00:59:53.522 --> 00:59:57.342
horse Trojan boat. And they're
coming out through a secret door

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-3
00:59:57.342 --> 01:00:00.984
or the front of the boat with
with Spears and coming towards

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-4
01:00:00.984 --> 01:00:04.864
the king who's standing between
the children and the bearded men

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-5
01:00:04.864 --> 01:00:08.625
and defending them against the
the supposed attackers. And the

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-6
01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:12.386
king has got something shiny and
glowing in his right hand and

f9cf846a-959c-4dbd-b9db-0ae759a1da7f-7
01:00:12.386 --> 01:00:13.579
he's holding it out.

03c39372-27ce-45a7-ae7e-8834965a799b-0
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.108
That as as a defense, perhaps,
or an attack weapon? We'll we'll

03c39372-27ce-45a7-ae7e-8834965a799b-1
01:00:20.108 --> 01:00:21.510
find out on the next page.

1be9452f-be78-4173-9869-d51431a3ab06-0
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.500
Still don't know what it is? You
could.

b453339d-f8b2-4c6c-b2af-fd7b939d11c2-0
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.742
Anyway, the the king is
protecting the children from the

b453339d-f8b2-4c6c-b2af-fd7b939d11c2-1
01:00:31.742 --> 01:00:34.531
bearded man. He's halfway down
the staircase, and the children

b453339d-f8b2-4c6c-b2af-fd7b939d11c2-2
01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.390
are behind him, the top of the
staircase.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:38.790
And there are these three.

9ab2110e-cf74-4d03-a3da-e935b6c3db6f-0
01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:44.530
I supposed attackers one of them
seems to have a.

d3bf8aa8-9818-4be9-9468-850daa60328e-0
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:49.520
Clockwork helmet. There's
something sticking out of and

d3bf8aa8-9818-4be9-9468-850daa60328e-1
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.218
and a wind up gizmo in his hand
and maybe a weapon or maybe not

d3bf8aa8-9818-4be9-9468-850daa60328e-2
01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:55.760
the king looks to be.

9dfea219-a7de-4f68-99fb-42c40f97687c-0
01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.239
Telling them to stay, you can,
you cannot. You can go no

9dfea219-a7de-4f68-99fb-42c40f97687c-1
01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:00.770
further.

d5c44672-4cba-4665-bc83-a4ea60068685-0
01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.407
Makes a sword. It's a sword that
he's got. He's he's conjured a

d5c44672-4cba-4665-bc83-a4ea60068685-1
01:01:06.407 --> 01:01:10.183

crayons out of his bandolier,

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:16.661
Fending off the tagging person
with his wind up gizmo, which

bc44dc9f-85d1-4c94-958a-f8eef186d80a-1
01:01:16.661 --> 01:01:21.609
seems to be attracting the magic
crayons out of the bandolier,

bc44dc9f-85d1-4c94-958a-f8eef186d80a-2
01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:24.829
and they're being sucked into
this this.

f4dd9bba-2037-461f-9705-b503cd7705d7-0
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.350
It looks a bit like a coffee
grinder, really, but.

f95dff86-6037-437d-90b8-6837cc38b93b-0
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:30.610
He's now.

c425ce34-9fbb-499d-9ccb-a0c29d315a40-0
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:34.251
Divested the king of his, of
his, of his, of his magic

c425ce34-9fbb-499d-9ccb-a0c29d315a40-1
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:37.416
crayons, and now the man with
the coffee grinder is running

c425ce34-9fbb-499d-9ccb-a0c29d315a40-2
01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:37.680
away.

dc7f6689-cc34-4bcc-9177-52eef2744018-0
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:39.620
Towards the next
page.

788b00e3-89b4-4abe-a920-4f56f761b0cd-0
01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.272
{Ohh, and then there's this.
There's a second slideshow to

788b00e3-89b4-4abe-a920-4f56f761b0cd-1
01:01:44.272 --> 01:01:44.830
this one.}

17403b7d-0b6f-4e87-b96b-d065a598b162-0
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:02.630
{OK.}

f45c7838-4b23-4fad-8c67-8d89d697930a-0
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:06.410
{And share.}

50b61574-e714-465e-a8fc-25099e02e38a-0
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:10.910
{And I'm just.}

fed2bdc8-4459-469a-a348-18b1bd653e9d-0
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.970
{Excuse me. OK, here we go.}

65c70c06-0040-4b13-9404-730f86776ad6-0
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:18.690
{OK, well this doesn't seem to.}

2ac749ec-2c4b-438d-b58f-b2f8a09f96a9-0
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:21.650
OK, right. So now we see.

18d1824f-0dcd-4b98-b523-6fb4d75465ea-0
01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.590
A man with a
coffee grinder. I don't really

18d1824f-0dcd-4b98-b523-6fb4d75465ea-1
01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:29.594
know what it would call it, the
coffee grinder. And then with

18d1824f-0dcd-4b98-b523-6fb4d75465ea-2
01:02:29.594 --> 01:02:31.290
the both children and the
bearded.

4553ccf1-7453-4c42-8094-d1ad7e16ecec-0
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:36.555
Man and the boy child children
who were in their golden crown,

4553ccf1-7453-4c42-8094-d1ad7e16ecec-1
01:02:36.555 --> 01:02:40.560
still king, is nowhere in
evidence. The boy child is now

4553ccf1-7453-4c42-8094-d1ad7e16ecec-2
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.915
using a purple crayon to Draw
Something it might or might not

4553ccf1-7453-4c42-8094-d1ad7e16ecec-3
01:02:44.915 --> 01:02:49.411
have a wing attached. And then
we look at their next page. Hang

4553ccf1-7453-4c42-8094-d1ad7e16ecec-4
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:51.660
on. No, no, no, don't turn over.

804d06c5-6482-42eb-993f-a9ad80a4bf71-0
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:59.430
And we've got to a flying horse
a where are they?

54b40aa3-d8fe-499e-b2f4-829ce4ec8f76-0
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:04.506
Griffins or something. And magic
bees it again. That's purple and

54b40aa3-d8fe-499e-b2f4-829ce4ec8f76-1
01:03:04.506 --> 01:03:08.503
it's it's it's shown with the
full moon behind it. Now it's

54b40aa3-d8fe-499e-b2f4-829ce4ec8f76-2
01:03:08.503 --> 01:03:12.100
making its escape over the sea,
away from the castle.

bba2e58d-be58-4dec-8ccc-574b5c043a16-0
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:13.870
With the.

9e9c026a-822e-47f8-a089-a3cd787d4a4d-0
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.901
Children and the man with the
beard safely aboard, looking

9e9c026a-822e-47f8-a089-a3cd787d4a4d-1
01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:21.088
back towards someone with an
outstretched hand saying no, no,

9e9c026a-822e-47f8-a089-a3cd787d4a4d-2
01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:22.269
no, no, you've escaped.

1509e3a9-1c02-4c8c-acaf-ad7f504c6889-0
01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.450
But what have they gone to next
page?

411d55ea-332a-4e8b-aeda-7a5c7b4db664-0
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.390
OK, let me move this.

5c5cf623-cde0-489c-8d56-5e8a5535dcd9-0
01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:35.470


562783a7-09ce-416d-9635-fc1bcbb7800f-0
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:40.361
So the next page we have them
flying away on the magic beast

562783a7-09ce-416d-9635-fc1bcbb7800f-1
01:03:40.361 --> 01:03:44.024
of the bearded man, the two
children, and also the purple

562783a7-09ce-416d-9635-fc1bcbb7800f-2
01:03:44.024 --> 01:03:44.340
bird.

520aa401-1069-4ef6-8e93-1db24690fc19-0
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:45.790
Uh.

c1b327de-6add-4bde-bbe8-28fbdee2c09c-0
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:52.608
The boy appears to have dropped
something. I don't know what it

c1b327de-6add-4bde-bbe8-28fbdee2c09c-1
01:03:52.608 --> 01:03:56.617
is, but in in pursuit the the
the boat with the the Trojan

c1b327de-6add-4bde-bbe8-28fbdee2c09c-2
01:03:56.617 --> 01:04:00.489
Horse boat now seems to be
flying after them in pursuit.

573cd656-cebd-4fca-a86a-6807a85f9b21-0
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:07.342
And we see that above the Castle
and there are three guards in

573cd656-cebd-4fca-a86a-6807a85f9b21-1
01:04:07.342 --> 01:04:07.720
the.

73fb074f-02bf-4911-bbd5-fe194a08e52f-0
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.509
Man that stole the bandolier,
he's now wearing it, and they're

73fb074f-02bf-4911-bbd5-fe194a08e52f-1
01:04:13.509 --> 01:04:16.350
following the children as they
make their escape.

7a08f9bf-f66e-4cd5-ab7e-b1502eca733f-0
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.220
Over the sea.

10188f7a-ea99-43fb-8913-df3ae459beff-0
01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:28.620
OK, what's happening here? Right
the.

4153d690-81e0-403a-b1d6-f8e2f5a93a3f-0
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:36.402
He thinks that the king is on
the back of the boat that was in

4153d690-81e0-403a-b1d6-f8e2f5a93a3f-1
01:04:36.402 --> 01:04:37.720
pursuit, and he's.

91fb8e69-17ad-4044-b8d2-9ab2baa47a1e-0
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.388
Somehow the boy child has fallen
out of the of the fallen off the

91fb8e69-17ad-4044-b8d2-9ab2baa47a1e-1
01:04:43.388 --> 01:04:47.807
the magical creature, and he's
being saved by the king leaning

91fb8e69-17ad-4044-b8d2-9ab2baa47a1e-2
01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:49.280
over the side of the.

ddcf0937-5b37-492a-9aba-71b80c140185-0
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.560
Trojan boat turned into flying
machine and over the sides and

ddcf0937-5b37-492a-9aba-71b80c140185-1
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.814
the the the the man that stole
the coffee grinder is at the bow

ddcf0937-5b37-492a-9aba-71b80c140185-2
01:04:58.814 --> 01:05:00.210
of the boat and he's.

8492898e-20df-40fb-ba3c-ee03adefbfde-0
01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:07.326
Empty out of his coffee grinder.
Lots of feathers, so I hope he

8492898e-20df-40fb-ba3c-ee03adefbfde-1
01:05:07.326 --> 01:05:07.920
hasn't.

e9659d33-96bf-45fb-a05b-666184e40663-0
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:12.290
Destroyed the purple bird. It
seems a bit sad if he has.

18435ee2-c469-45b5-a9eb-92270706cdac-0
01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.121
And then we also see the girl
child has lost her crown and is

18435ee2-c469-45b5-a9eb-92270706cdac-1
01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:21.126
falling through the air holding
on to the bearded man. But the

18435ee2-c469-45b5-a9eb-92270706cdac-2
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:24.876
girl child still has a red
crayon in her hand and also she

18435ee2-c469-45b5-a9eb-92270706cdac-3
01:05:24.876 --> 01:05:28.881
has the purple bird under her
arms and the bird is quite safe.

18435ee2-c469-45b5-a9eb-92270706cdac-4
01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:32.950
So I don't know where all these
purple feathers have come from.

1c114c26-2a8a-49dd-8447-c652b2f0d0d1-0
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.740
The Purple Bird is is safe.

145fb093-b4a4-49f9-bef7-8f2c07acc772-0
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.280
For now.

b743db6d-6d99-4e05-8312-a2fd9dc2a93e-0
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:43.725
And they fallen from the sky.
They now fallen underwater.

b743db6d-6d99-4e05-8312-a2fd9dc2a93e-1
01:05:43.725 --> 01:05:46.980
There are fishes and underwater
mountains and.

c5686965-6c5a-42f9-ab46-b23d9c149b74-0
01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:51.405
 The boys crown has fallen off
and it's and it's, it's, it's

c5686965-6c5a-42f9-ab46-b23d9c149b74-1
01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:53.120
sinking to the bottom of the
sea.

012c7234-d009-46b7-bb68-56e1c69a8a1b-0
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:57.751
And the bearded man, and the boy
is thinking, thou are the golden

012c7234-d009-46b7-bb68-56e1c69a8a1b-1
01:05:57.751 --> 01:05:58.980
fish swimming around.

d353913f-ec95-4e24-8bea-c24c511994fd-0
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.886
But me as the boy is falling
with the purple bird of the

d353913f-ec95-4e24-8bea-c24c511994fd-1
01:06:03.886 --> 01:06:08.208
bearded man. He's drawing
something with his red crayon on

d353913f-ec95-4e24-8bea-c24c511994fd-2
01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:10.260
a on a white background. So.

63d6bc42-b7df-428b-9574-c0b4a409ce35-0
01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:13.910
We'll see what that is that he's
drawing on the next page.

283900df-5448-4844-bd5e-f6f6d7f6ceb2-0
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.750
OK, so the first half of the
image.

287c8d60-bc26-40fb-92d9-af7474640371-0
01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.569
Is the underwater scene with
coral reefs, coral reefs and no

287c8d60-bc26-40fb-92d9-af7474640371-1
01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:32.200
fishes? Nothing obvious in that,
just the.

ef237290-9d35-4b8a-9742-eaec0928f04d-0
01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.260
Is the the landscape of the
seascape underwater?

d47c7e64-b8d0-43c2-ae47-1fe97ac34a48-0
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:41.842
With the waves above and the
island above below, there's

d47c7e64-b8d0-43c2-ae47-1fe97ac34a48-1
01:06:41.842 --> 01:06:46.620
nothing apparent above from
coral the next half of the.

cd914896-e916-4cf2-bd17-ca29e4959975-0
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.641
Screen we see what the boy has
drawn and it was a red

cd914896-e916-4cf2-bd17-ca29e4959975-1
01:06:50.641 --> 01:06:51.260
submarine.

ad053e0b-452c-47cb-a32b-f2be3046c54c-0
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:56.156
And he's looking through the
Periscope and the bearded man

ad053e0b-452c-47cb-a32b-f2be3046c54c-1
01:06:56.156 --> 01:06:56.370
is.

f616426b-5736-4f19-90b5-ef5586a8305b-0
01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:01.725
Down below, maybe operating the
submarine and the Purple bird is

f616426b-5736-4f19-90b5-ef5586a8305b-1
01:07:01.725 --> 01:07:06.072
in the front of the submarine,
looking out to see where they're

f616426b-5736-4f19-90b5-ef5586a8305b-2
01:07:06.072 --> 01:07:06.480
going.

02526e8e-f6bb-4fdc-be6c-33143b5f4aab-0
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:13.790
And where they're going is a
cave.

fe1f6163-fa10-43e8-a715-148dd6631079-0
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:18.758
Well, the submarine is now
stopped, and the bearded man and

fe1f6163-fa10-43e8-a715-148dd6631079-1
01:07:18.758 --> 01:07:22.305
the boy in the purple bird of
Got out and they're looking

fe1f6163-fa10-43e8-a715-148dd6631079-2
01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.140
around The Cave and there are.

e195d8e4-369f-4a19-97a3-e8dec4b67a5b-0
01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.170
Inscriptions on the petroglyphs
on on on The Cave walls there.

ca2fb627-7e47-450d-83b9-f59e534d2188-0
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.440
Images of people and.

281536ac-db80-481d-af50-2fa23d0663c9-0
01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:40.236
Uh, a little bit small big stick
stick people stick stick

281536ac-db80-481d-af50-2fa23d0663c9-1
01:07:40.236 --> 01:07:40.920
drawings.

c341fc64-7d00-40f2-8a1f-398a09159b16-0
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:45.440
And they seem to be.

88696016-5d5d-4ea2-87d2-84d10e6b3241-0
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.080
Well, the the the.

5bf7a629-816f-4e77-b4e9-db383f4dc2d7-0
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:52.739
The man and the boy and the bird
have disappeared from the next

5bf7a629-816f-4e77-b4e9-db383f4dc2d7-1
01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:56.160
screen, so we just got the
images on the on the wall like.

41cda683-8d9b-4cac-bff7-ba7d580eadb4-0
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.720
Stone Age Cavemen drawings.

2551142a-e6cd-42e0-8e27-5bd76a7ab62c-0
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:02.030
We'll find out what happens
next.

82130cf0-85b0-4504-bda1-c3ffb7b1d99a-0
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:09.676
OK, the man and the boy and the
purple bird are now in The Cave

82130cf0-85b0-4504-bda1-c3ffb7b1d99a-1
01:08:09.676 --> 01:08:12.000
proper, and the boy is pointing.

92884144-6229-44a3-8366-d2b7d42b391f-0
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:17.502
To some images on the wall and
one of them shows one of these

92884144-6229-44a3-8366-d2b7d42b391f-1
01:08:17.502 --> 01:08:18.520
stick people.

9d3f4ff4-2c5d-49d9-a5e6-b81c9f70bd67-0
01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:20.430
Emptying.

93992960-f1ad-4825-95b6-b1db78e27502-0
01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:24.604
Pot of something, and then
another stick person holding a

93992960-f1ad-4825-95b6-b1db78e27502-1
01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:26.120
shiny object in his hand.

8fa33c35-2335-4ecb-90c3-d4478e878f2f-0
01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:31.581
And there's a small mysterious
doorway which I think we'll

8fa33c35-2335-4ecb-90c3-d4478e878f2f-1
01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:36.752
figure next. But if we look at
the other direction, we see the

8fa33c35-2335-4ecb-90c3-d4478e878f2f-2
01:08:36.752 --> 01:08:41.922
out of the cave back into the
wider world and is now daylight.

8fa33c35-2335-4ecb-90c3-d4478e878f2f-3
01:08:41.922 --> 01:08:46.190
And you see a seascape and
distant hills, and they.

2f5583a0-dee3-47d5-a1c6-817a28fadb21-0
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:48.120
Pebbly beach.

a164c64d-d9a0-4127-b31d-466aeb3cced9-0
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:50.010
But no people.

fc87f6ef-855e-4082-b136-9eba0aae4bb8-0
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:56.650
Always we do. We maybe we see a
shadow on the wall.

62f2eb4e-8bf1-4fa4-a84e-0c5c2022923e-0
01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.750
Or what might be it could be a
dinosaur shadow.

a62e59d3-6e3b-469d-8bee-662a1840e07d-0
01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:02.870
Maybe not. Maybe it's just me.

3c92e615-c376-4ea4-870b-57d9f5a8c82a-0
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.680
We'll find out on the next page.

532eff2a-aeb2-4e50-abc2-9f56ce33b63e-0
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.200
It isn't the dinosaur, it's a
shadow of the pursuing boat.

46fac428-7692-482f-bd29-ed830b5010d7-0
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:16.184
Which has big ears and and and
the face and the. The pursuers

46fac428-7692-482f-bd29-ed830b5010d7-1
01:09:16.184 --> 01:09:20.637
have caught up with the bearded
man, and the boy and the purple

46fac428-7692-482f-bd29-ed830b5010d7-2
01:09:20.637 --> 01:09:23.490
bird are hiding, hiding behind a
pillar.

4031d8d8-e167-4c31-89a0-fba22125d577-0
01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:27.830
But there are still the the Old
Stone Age graffiti on the wall.

ed80afab-e3e0-4b07-bb50-a2d77c852dcf-0
01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.591
And then we look over to the
next part of the screen. We see

ed80afab-e3e0-4b07-bb50-a2d77c852dcf-1
01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:34.380
the bearded man and the girl
child.

d572120c-c76b-4e5c-a8a5-13ac64283358-0
01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:41.160
The purple bird and the bearded
man now has the crayon.

a41ebfa7-7d0e-4925-a2aa-e3e4ad9d03d5-0
01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:45.830
And he's drawing something. He's
drawing a doorway and hung the.

9af347d0-b1c8-4394-9f6d-873d3c6e34c3-0
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:47.120
Bird.

0c57abd5-47b4-443e-b4b6-330a330c38e5-0
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:51.773
From the top of the doorway on
its perch and the girl child is

0c57abd5-47b4-443e-b4b6-330a330c38e5-1
01:09:51.773 --> 01:09:55.299
scratching its head, saying, I
wonder what this is going to

0c57abd5-47b4-443e-b4b6-330a330c38e5-2
01:09:55.299 --> 01:09:55.770
produce.

8b352779-b4fe-4eea-9219-09f7d41c983b-0
01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.210
We'll find out on the next page.

5bb3e3d3-00d1-416a-9db8-8fca413badcb-0
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.730
And they he's drawn like he's
would become.

04604968-901a-47d2-a407-be8cb7dcd829-0
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.320
Garden.

4b7fec10-9406-4b24-92f0-7ff9e3184521-0
01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:14.695
There's a mini pagoda. I
forgotten the word for what

4b7fec10-9406-4b24-92f0-7ff9e3184521-1
01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:18.429
these buildings are called, and
the is a girl child, not the boy

4b7fec10-9406-4b24-92f0-7ff9e3184521-2
01:10:18.429 --> 01:10:21.934
child. And the bearded man are
hiding behind the pillar. The

4b7fec10-9406-4b24-92f0-7ff9e3184521-3
01:10:21.934 --> 01:10:24.059
Purple bird is on its swing in
this.

67c3ee9e-26a9-4fc3-b938-060f3cae98c2-0
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:29.328
Large cage and the man with the
coffee grinder is trying to suck

67c3ee9e-26a9-4fc3-b938-060f3cae98c2-1
01:10:29.328 --> 01:10:32.717
in the bird into that
contraption. He's running

67c3ee9e-26a9-4fc3-b938-060f3cae98c2-2
01:10:32.717 --> 01:10:34.200
towards it. And then.

f56b2c30-ac75-4a78-abd5-26846145a07d-0
01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.300
They did bearded man the girl
child are hiding from him.

8d6b4db5-2ee1-4931-bd86-75660e414db7-0
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.440
Now we see the.

b580f085-e295-4d4e-84b2-55b7a9b6af90-0
01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.940
Man with the coffee grinder has
captured the bird.

e11d3bdb-e588-41ea-8624-abdd83c38fed-0
01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:48.487
But he's dropped the coffee
grinder and the bearded man has

e11d3bdb-e588-41ea-8624-abdd83c38fed-1
01:10:48.487 --> 01:10:53.076
found it picked up and it's
about to dash into the ground.

e11d3bdb-e588-41ea-8624-abdd83c38fed-2
01:10:53.076 --> 01:10:55.410
And the coffee grinder man is.

d38f2e8e-36fe-4e3b-be3b-88990dbf6475-0
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:58.770
Captured inside the cage.

9e1b13bb-40a4-45e6-ae9d-1a2e1a007ebe-0
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:02.570
Go.

9fad7b29-f83e-464e-98e6-493be7f54f5b-0
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.870
Well, there's a big explosion
and lots of sparks and.

3f56fa92-0de4-4b93-8021-07927b25f08a-0
01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:14.708
Blue-green and purple lights and
stars and flashes and explosions

3f56fa92-0de4-4b93-8021-07927b25f08a-1
01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:20.014
as the bearded man breaks the
coffee grinding machine and the

3f56fa92-0de4-4b93-8021-07927b25f08a-2
01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:24.550
coffee grinder man is imprisoned
in the in the cage.

95efc8d4-c995-412b-a7f7-a9ef0a1e95a6-0
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.740
The.

97387e02-b955-4a5e-b3be-1e80e9a30156-0
01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:30.413
Purple Bird is coming out of the
out of the explosion and

97387e02-b955-4a5e-b3be-1e80e9a30156-1
01:11:30.413 --> 01:11:34.210
reforming itself as a creature
again. And then we see.

edf74490-5b3a-4b12-983e-a9eaa3806311-0
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.808
The Trojan boat with the
pursuers aboard, they're looking

edf74490-5b3a-4b12-983e-a9eaa3806311-1
01:11:38.808 --> 01:11:42.861
in anguish. What's going on?
Holding their hands up against

edf74490-5b3a-4b12-983e-a9eaa3806311-2
01:11:42.861 --> 01:11:47.050
the bright lights and the king
has reappeared. And the bright

edf74490-5b3a-4b12-983e-a9eaa3806311-3
01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:50.968
lights with the boy child when
they're both wearing their

edf74490-5b3a-4b12-983e-a9eaa3806311-4
01:11:50.968 --> 01:11:55.224
crowns. And the purple dragonfly
is there, and there are other

edf74490-5b3a-4b12-983e-a9eaa3806311-5
01:11:55.224 --> 01:11:58.399
dragonflies and butterflies and
everything is.

f8532d8d-3ff2-42f4-b152-d268e7171604-0
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.240
That really is good. The the
posturers of thrown down their

f8532d8d-3ff2-42f4-b152-d268e7171604-1
01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.120
Spears and.

0f020077-ecd9-4d0b-886a-4fbed1b77f88-0
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:08.390
Looking vanquished.

90f0c17a-49a5-4df4-806a-239b5f631c90-0
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:11.490
Next.

21dd34b3-2500-40d5-bc39-05eef9c127d1-0
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.940
And here we see the from the
inside of The Cave looking out.

0210d767-f377-4cf9-84d1-d0720e8adf4c-0
01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:20.120
The.

7aec3d85-035e-47fb-ad4d-ceec11729cd0-0
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.570
Large.

23d6a496-dcde-487f-86df-9d4687f631fd-0
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:28.239
The Griffin is back and he's
taking away the cage with

23d6a496-dcde-487f-86df-9d4687f631fd-1
01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:32.374
flanked by lots of multicoloured
smaller birds and they're all

23d6a496-dcde-487f-86df-9d4687f631fd-2
01:12:32.374 --> 01:12:36.247
flowing out of The Cave and
that's causing the larger bird

23d6a496-dcde-487f-86df-9d4687f631fd-3
01:12:36.247 --> 01:12:40.381
out into the distance. On the
sea we see the Trojan boat going

23d6a496-dcde-487f-86df-9d4687f631fd-4
01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:44.319
away and the purple octopus is
is escorting it or towing it

23d6a496-dcde-487f-86df-9d4687f631fd-5
01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:45.370
back out to sea.

5acbad34-edb7-4460-b5b3-b56219eca8f2-0
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:49.150
The king and the boy child was
standing. The King has his arm

5acbad34-edb7-4460-b5b3-b56219eca8f2-1
01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:52.211
on the boy child's shoulder and
the Purple Bird is sitting on

5acbad34-edb7-4460-b5b3-b56219eca8f2-2
01:12:52.211 --> 01:12:53.099
the king shoulder.

4c60ccbf-d1fc-49e6-b746-d614e8eb2134-0
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:54.920
The bearded man is.

10c35ca2-70e8-44ad-ba16-7483c060a90b-0
01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.680
Holding the girl, child or the
on on her shoulder, they're all

10c35ca2-70e8-44ad-ba16-7483c060a90b-1
01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.340
looking at each other, looking
very pleased with themselves.

bf0ed3ba-dd7d-4bd3-9411-cbb5df6265fc-0
01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.072
And then the next image shows
the girl child hugging the

bf0ed3ba-dd7d-4bd3-9411-cbb5df6265fc-1
01:13:08.072 --> 01:13:11.865
bearded man who has a purple
crayon in his in his in his

bf0ed3ba-dd7d-4bd3-9411-cbb5df6265fc-2
01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:12.730
shirt pocket.

8909f893-f721-4c44-8196-426bac0e3de4-0
01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:16.060
And the king and the boy child,
and the purple bird

87d42144-9147-4a1d-80f7-2b2b8f3fc552-0
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.375
King and the boy child. They
were in the golden crowns.

87d42144-9147-4a1d-80f7-2b2b8f3fc552-1
01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:22.410
They're standing a little way
off.

d712ba55-4c92-41c4-85fd-a976bfeac80c-0
01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:27.910
Looking at what's going on with
the girl child, and behind them

d712ba55-4c92-41c4-85fd-a976bfeac80c-1
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.628
and the bearded man is that
small doorway in The Cave we saw

d712ba55-4c92-41c4-85fd-a976bfeac80c-2
01:13:31.628 --> 01:13:35.285
earlier, but now it's slightly
ajar, perhaps leading to the

d712ba55-4c92-41c4-85fd-a976bfeac80c-3
01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:36.200
next adventure.

dbd357a8-ecb7-4caf-8118-2b621d8dfab9-0
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:44.527
Which indeed leads us back to
the cityscape where we first

dbd357a8-ecb7-4caf-8118-2b621d8dfab9-1
01:13:44.527 --> 01:13:49.600
started, and we see the building
where we where we where we saw

dbd357a8-ecb7-4caf-8118-2b621d8dfab9-2
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.900
the the characters initially.

b38f2488-06f0-4dfa-be83-bf116360c2c3-0
01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.884
Empty of the people, but the red
kite is now flying outside the

b38f2488-06f0-4dfa-be83-bf116360c2c3-1
01:13:57.884 --> 01:14:00.090
building where it all started.

7e776c3f-3d28-4ee6-8b26-65a476a944c8-0
01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.490
No people in evidence.

a9207fd5-8d73-404e-b018-e0ad4584e0f4-0
01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:06.320
#END_return Is it?

0684f416-2eee-4134-8e1e-48b48d411b3e-0
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.530
Hey, would you like to take
it?

658c956d-a7b1-4b32-a42b-774762e3bf69-0
01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:16.335
Yes, that's the end of that
one. Would you like to take a

658c956d-a7b1-4b32-a42b-774762e3bf69-1
01:14:16.335 --> 01:14:18.160
break? Yes, please. OK.

2e0621a3-ff31-479b-a955-86b71afb0741-0
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:21.560
Deep.

12baac3d-666d-4263-b275-aafb611b10e9-0
01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.330
OK.

c5c0b407-5a83-4329-8e51-352c377e7ddc-0
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:37.978
And so you were about to see a
complex scene. So imagine you

c5c0b407-5a83-4329-8e51-352c377e7ddc-1
01:14:37.978 --> 01:14:41.612
were describing the scene to
someone who cannot see the

c5c0b407-5a83-4329-8e51-352c377e7ddc-2
01:14:41.612 --> 01:14:45.245
picture. Describe what is
happening and what you see in

c5c0b407-5a83-4329-8e51-352c377e7ddc-3
01:14:45.245 --> 01:14:49.269
this scene and be as thorough as
possible. Please try to take

c5c0b407-5a83-4329-8e51-352c377e7ddc-4
01:14:49.269 --> 01:14:52.837
roughly 3 to 5 minutes to
describe the scene so I will

c5c0b407-5a83-4329-8e51-352c377e7ddc-5
01:14:52.837 --> 01:14:54.589
stop sharing my screen and.

bbfdae99-4c3c-4b1b-b76b-6176dd204bbe-0
01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:59.635
Was doing before rather than
telling a story. I'm sorry. Ohh

bbfdae99-4c3c-4b1b-b76b-6176dd204bbe-1
01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:03.411
no you forgot you were telling
the story. I'm just gonna pull

bbfdae99-4c3c-4b1b-b76b-6176dd204bbe-2
01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:04.630
up the first scene.

5fb874e7-5e0a-45ba-9f40-49dc3bbc8e25-0
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.000
OK. And now I will share it.

1383b88b-15eb-4554-83c3-b51aa44edca2-0
01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:21.700
Ohh I already had it up.

0f58f842-c01f-43a1-8c40-347e9433b0ce-0
01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:26.610
No I don't have it. Ohh no I'm
not like.

40f0d917-681b-4b34-8dcd-7c0169c83ed0-0
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.700
Yeah, you're good.

d4892bc6-e10d-4493-9c37-9bb0582021a5-0
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:30.140
Ohh my.

f1ab0e44-d014-49d3-b9bf-7af2e772b323-0
01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:42.730
OK, it is complex isn't it? Lots
going on in this one.

3cb55363-b408-44ed-8050-f6fadbdf8541-0
01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.470
Are you ready? Yep. OK.

c3ce6b26-9913-4e19-8d6e-75605011609b-0
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:51.513
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
this is a very busy scene and

c3ce6b26-9913-4e19-8d6e-75605011609b-1
01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:54.030
it's called escape from the zoo
and the.

bd16028c-2159-4468-85d4-0b4f28aff3c3-0
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.434
Description is the Penguins were
bored with life at the zoo, so

bd16028c-2159-4468-85d4-0b4f28aff3c3-1
01:15:59.434 --> 01:16:02.550
they hatched a plan to escape
from their enclosure.

2bbb0d1c-7ad6-4a25-bc47-dc14d382ad09-0
01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:07.922
Enjoying the newfound freedom,
completely unaware of the chaos

2bbb0d1c-7ad6-4a25-bc47-dc14d382ad09-1
01:16:07.922 --> 01:16:11.999
they have created around them.
Spike loves skateboarding, and

2bbb0d1c-7ad6-4a25-bc47-dc14d382ad09-2
01:16:11.999 --> 01:16:15.746
Muffy cannot believe that ice
cream cones taste so good.

2bbb0d1c-7ad6-4a25-bc47-dc14d382ad09-3
01:16:15.746 --> 01:16:18.640
Presumably that's the name of
the Penguins.

65b90ed4-155c-483e-b06e-98b8bc950a11-0
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.180
Can I pick out all 10 Penguins
and I don't know. We'll have a

65b90ed4-155c-483e-b06e-98b8bc950a11-1
01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:23.360
go.

4dc38e5a-1ff0-4082-b54a-84c39d2e5813-0
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:28.695
First of all, describing the
scene, it's the City's Zoo. You

4dc38e5a-1ff0-4082-b54a-84c39d2e5813-1
01:16:28.695 --> 01:16:32.501
can see the buildings in the
background, there's a number of

4dc38e5a-1ff0-4082-b54a-84c39d2e5813-2
01:16:32.501 --> 01:16:36.182
enclosures we can see and
walkways between them and people

4dc38e5a-1ff0-4082-b54a-84c39d2e5813-3
01:16:36.182 --> 01:16:39.988
and lots of animals, all in the
wrong place it seems that we

4dc38e5a-1ff0-4082-b54a-84c39d2e5813-4
01:16:39.988 --> 01:16:40.300
have.

ee836971-6654-4b12-bad3-9db926d6f236-0
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.136
We have polar bears waving at
people. Something odd in a tree.

ee836971-6654-4b12-bad3-9db926d6f236-1
01:16:45.136 --> 01:16:45.800
There's a.

2999c615-32a1-40ed-bae5-75ad2b1e3655-0
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:51.406
Cross Eyed Bird is an EMU or
some description. Lemurs,

2999c615-32a1-40ed-bae5-75ad2b1e3655-1
01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:54.440
ringtail lemurs and trade their
cross eyed too.

cce6ee99-3a07-4559-99fe-8bd5e5bbe535-0
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.410
Zebra. Zebra.

52a368d4-4423-456e-8baf-17f12912d04d-0
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:06.200
Spoonbills, flamingos, the child
in her pram and.

a9a9060f-f5e4-48bd-b680-fdb7b6110237-0
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:13.058
Man with a fishing net. I can't
see any any Penguins yet, though

a9a9060f-f5e4-48bd-b680-fdb7b6110237-1
01:17:13.058 --> 01:17:17.350
there's a Penguin in an airplane
being pursued by a parrot.

9b58501e-85c5-44a1-82f0-661d27a26529-0
01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.250
Monkeys in the tree here, and
that's it. And the gorilla.

5ffca69f-a1b9-4886-abf1-e9d365594c6b-0
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.770
On a on a Cliff face, behind the
trees, there's a shop with a

5ffca69f-a1b9-4886-abf1-e9d365594c6b-1
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.830
that might be another Penguin on
the roof.

6cf0f4e9-09dd-4a7d-bbb8-c672ee5392cf-0
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:38.260
Bull headed eagle.

3168e936-12fa-4dbd-8747-e71d18c31993-0
01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.260
Cafe has a.

1b09eb4b-4d90-4582-a66d-32281eebb827-0
01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.661
The toucan on its roof. People
looking in the window on a on,

1b09eb4b-4d90-4582-a66d-32281eebb827-1
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:48.360
aware of what's going on there.
I think they're buying tickets

1b09eb4b-4d90-4582-a66d-32281eebb827-2
01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.825
to the to the zoo. They don't
know what's happening behind

1b09eb4b-4d90-4582-a66d-32281eebb827-3
01:17:51.825 --> 01:17:55.055
them. More people with
strollers. Giraffe again. Cross

1b09eb4b-4d90-4582-a66d-32281eebb827-4
01:17:55.055 --> 01:17:56.700
eyed. 2 Giraffes cross eyed.

2b84413d-8a82-4c35-9175-2e458b3368bf-0
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.687
A rhinoceros scattering people
he runs down the main

2b84413d-8a82-4c35-9175-2e458b3368bf-1
01:18:02.687 --> 01:18:06.787
thoroughfare hippopotamus.
Hippopotamus in the river with

2b84413d-8a82-4c35-9175-2e458b3368bf-2
01:18:06.787 --> 01:18:09.049
the with the with the flamingos.

858a40e1-3f3c-4f7a-93df-b210467f43d2-0
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.210
There's a lion.

208da83b-442a-4757-87d8-7ecf7b6ce631-0
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:16.520
Looking down from up high,
licking his lips and the Gopher.

5ac1ecd0-dc58-4a75-bebf-13140572a950-0
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:21.290
Peering up out of his hole. I've
only seen one Penguin so far.

b4ae12b3-c482-4c83-a13e-624b00700491-0
01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.440
Looking for a Penguin? Now polar
bears are having fun.

a4bbdc47-b042-4be9-a86f-e617fdd7859a-0
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:27.970
The.

ede8480f-1f06-4cbd-80ab-c8a1db68c093-0
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.966
Man looking into the polar bear
enclosure, but there's nothing

ede8480f-1f06-4cbd-80ab-c8a1db68c093-1
01:18:31.966 --> 01:18:34.781
in it that he could. His hands
in his pocket, looking very

ede8480f-1f06-4cbd-80ab-c8a1db68c093-2
01:18:34.781 --> 01:18:37.740
disdainful. There are no polar
bears the kangaroo behind him.

0bd81ad9-a35c-40e2-bc48-cdb17fa91774-0
01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:42.247
Large ice cream cone vendor
someone buying an ice cream

0bd81ad9-a35c-40e2-bc48-cdb17fa91774-1
01:18:42.247 --> 01:18:45.260
doesn't care about the
excitement behind him.

651d3fa6-f729-4cc9-9bce-337ce1435f16-0
01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:49.370
Someone feeding a bag of buns
to.

653f02f7-9e30-417a-98b4-f33ec6c07446-0
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:50.950
Hyenas.

73497a78-52ce-4452-8783-04304f7b2ace-0
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:54.290
Uh, what else have we got?

dfdc0c11-5032-46f9-acb0-ad026fa45df3-0
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.450
Such a lot going on.

b02d43b7-f82e-4f49-a9cf-41cab68ad33b-0
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.414
Well, if there are 10 Penguins
in here, nine of them are very,

b02d43b7-f82e-4f49-a9cf-41cab68ad33b-1
01:19:04.414 --> 01:19:05.990
very sneaky. I can't find them
at all.

5428c285-03b7-438b-9be0-99e2da1550e4-0
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.460
Absolute, absolute chaos.

01923b2e-8a6d-43ff-968d-e41f0f45d391-0
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.740
I want a Peacock.

8656725b-e90e-4be5-8b69-14dab745ec45-0
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:21.006
The Penguin hiding in the in the
in the in the display of the

8656725b-e90e-4be5-8b69-14dab745ec45-1
01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.530
Peacock display that we found
two Penguins.

e593680e-cef0-448c-8314-4c0b3a21611b-0
01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:32.750
Yeah, I think, I think, I think.

4b099615-59ec-493a-9dfc-edd0e8ee98d0-0
01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.967
I think there are only two. I
think. I think there was, there

4b099615-59ec-493a-9dfc-edd0e8ee98d0-1
01:19:36.967 --> 01:19:39.606
was false saying there were ten
of them. We've we could, if

4b099615-59ec-493a-9dfc-edd0e8ee98d0-2
01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:42.290
there are eight of them, are
very good at hiding themselves.

86362d40-3cd4-459f-bc36-52add4201559-0
01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.937
I think that's the scene. It's
it's absolute mayhem, the centre

86362d40-3cd4-459f-bc36-52add4201559-1
01:19:49.937 --> 01:19:50.760
of a city zoo.

df43f1ad-d4dc-4ee0-9668-146971a64ead-0
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.030
#END_escape_from_the_zoo OK.

b04eb01b-a40a-4544-a0a4-7f799a787153-0
01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.650
Perfect. And now?

f1b873e4-1706-4b77-85f7-857f90bdebfd-0
01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.060
I found six I couldn't find.

115c64d0-7702-4396-a5bf-8761ad139d48-0
01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.302
No, I I, I actually, I think
I've only seen this one once,

01:20:09.302 --> 01:20:14.007
but that was the first time I've
looked for them. Let's see what

115c64d0-7702-4396-a5bf-8761ad139d48-2
01:20:14.007 --> 01:20:15.600
we have next. So the.

d351ecbc-c741-4dc2-b46f-8865e3d18906-0
01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.050
See escape from zoo.

2b003369-b55e-4423-af95-79165585b6e2-0
01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.140
And now we have.

6c195342-c4a2-4815-9e14-8e882f38ee1c-0
01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:29.640
I'm going.

bb09fe25-bdf6-4313-a08f-8f179892b971-0
01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.268
OK, we get another one like
this. We get another complex

bb09fe25-bdf6-4313-a08f-8f179892b971-1
01:20:35.268 --> 01:20:35.650
scene.

989faffa-e1cd-41c5-9a1c-ec032f3e9b61-0
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:38.120
With Penguins.

ddeb3004-1d0f-41c2-abb9-7953bb8302bf-0
01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.900
I don't know. We'll see what we
have. Let's download this one.

76e1d702-adf0-4723-b657-5eddb0de1604-0
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:44.850
Alright.

7bb42ec2-1cdd-41b0-a3a0-d95e2dc72380-0
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.230
This one is called unfriendly
giants.

a08ea373-2c91-42f9-8fcc-dd47fbcb737b-0
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:55.770
And.

ac36fdde-ec75-49a3-8a7f-b9da07d4511b-0
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:02.040
There we go.

62bf3625-085a-459e-a0c7-7a9a96f5e5ad-0
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:04.850
Again, it is complex.

b6d4962e-be4d-4405-ae5e-fa313a6f121e-0
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:12.701
#START_unfriendly_giants Are we
ready? OK, it's titled the

b6d4962e-be4d-4405-ae5e-fa313a6f121e-1
01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:17.526
unfriendly giants. {Then Waldo
and wizard. White beard came to

b6d4962e-be4d-4405-ae5e-fa313a6f121e-2
01:21:17.526 --> 01:21:21.963
the land of the unfriendly
giants, where many waldos had

b6d4962e-be4d-4405-ae5e-fa313a6f121e-3
01:21:21.963 --> 01:21:26.399
been before. And Waldo saw that
the Giants were horribly

b6d4962e-be4d-4405-ae5e-fa313a6f121e-4
01:21:26.399 --> 01:21:31.380
harassing the little people, and
when he found the 10th scroll,

b6d4962e-be4d-4405-ae5e-fa313a6f121e-5
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.960
it was time to continue with his
journey. OK.}

59f52747-a42e-40d0-9527-42e475ee44ed-0
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.140
So we can see.

937c1c17-619b-4aa6-8d0d-2332338e4cca-0
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.102
Lots of giants, there's one, too
many to count and creating

937c1c17-619b-4aa6-8d0d-2332338e4cca-1
01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:52.714
mayhem. One of them, swiping the
sails of a windmill is seems to

937c1c17-619b-4aa6-8d0d-2332338e4cca-2
01:21:52.714 --> 01:21:54.850
be garbled or wooden.

e9fa6ed5-3e70-4b5f-baa2-e74a247d0db4-0
01:21:57.050 --> 01:22:00.450
Cut out figures of of the people
quite large, as big as the

e9fa6ed5-3e70-4b5f-baa2-e74a247d0db4-1
01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:01.300
Giants females.

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:03.020
And the Giants are.

77fefc21-e4f4-4413-80eb-7e33ce02887a-0
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:07.882
Approaching them amorously, one
giant's got a good people tucked

77fefc21-e4f4-4413-80eb-7e33ce02887a-1
01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:08.760
into his belt.

bb4a9c5b-d29b-4ba8-a650-4c5a57f21e04-0
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.843
Another one is playing chess
with miniature with with with

bb4a9c5b-d29b-4ba8-a650-4c5a57f21e04-1
01:22:12.843 --> 01:22:14.990
with people instead of chess
pieces.

b13f2541-da5d-4bb0-a77f-c5ca45a10632-0
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.490
Another one is bashing.

f713d767-47b7-4866-9384-bf0e39c7bdd3-0
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.510
Small people.

d62179f8-e60f-42d4-8fa4-70471dd5514c-0
01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.862
What I'm trying there's such a
lot going on it's it's difficult

d62179f8-e60f-42d4-8fa4-70471dd5514c-1
01:22:28.862 --> 01:22:30.570
to to concentrate on just one.

bdc7f9cc-9252-4732-98c8-b5e69464e8bb-0
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:36.180
one one Giants are now scaling
the castle and doing and.

9ff3eef0-c482-4f0f-8258-2ca075981b36-0
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:40.341
Which is isn't helping, isn't
doing, isn't much of a defense.

9ff3eef0-c482-4f0f-8258-2ca075981b36-1
01:22:40.341 --> 01:22:43.613
Another giant has people stuck
in its belt. It must be that's

9ff3eef0-c482-4f0f-8258-2ca075981b36-2
01:22:43.613 --> 01:22:45.829
the way the way they keep them
prisoners.

5a03e8a2-8575-4d82-a46e-b070a45e85b5-0
01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.130
There's this small farm building
with people tied to it.

2127abf9-5dba-4ecf-8959-a1d82df8e786-0
01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:56.326
Another giant is tying people to
another building and process of

2127abf9-5dba-4ecf-8959-a1d82df8e786-1
01:22:56.326 --> 01:22:58.000
lassoing them to the building.

f2d08045-e9ce-4904-ae0c-2c2d3c384331-0
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:09.525
Yeah, I don't see any scrolls. I
don't know. I don't know. He's

01:23:09.525 --> 01:23:12.991
talking about 10 scrolls. I
can't see any scrolls. There's a

f2d08045-e9ce-4904-ae0c-2c2d3c384331-2
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:16.343
there's a siege engine that
yeah, the the people have been

f2d08045-e9ce-4904-ae0c-2c2d3c384331-3
01:23:16.343 --> 01:23:19.638
trying to defend themselves
against the giants with them.

f2d08045-e9ce-4904-ae0c-2c2d3c384331-4
01:23:19.638 --> 01:23:22.933
One of those held a stone is
bounced off a giant head and

f2d08045-e9ce-4904-ae0c-2c2d3c384331-5
01:23:22.933 --> 01:23:24.239
killed some people and.

39970879-a9fc-477a-bdd3-92a8e1b52fb6-0
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.630

The other giants using straws to
suck the village pond dry.

There's a large ohh I see the

of giant females are traps for
the the people have constructed

01:23:49.033 --> 01:23:53.460
to defend themselves against the
giants. The Giants are making

081d9c56-34b4-42fb-b491-39cc0e42a6ed-3
01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:58.027
amorous advances to these wooden
structures, and in fact they're

081d9c56-34b4-42fb-b491-39cc0e42a6ed-4
01:23:58.027 --> 01:24:02.314
just disguising large mallets
behind in an attempt to to hit

081d9c56-34b4-42fb-b491-39cc0e42a6ed-5
01:24:02.314 --> 01:24:06.670
the giants. But it's not having
any effect at all. People are

01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:09.130
woefully inadequate against
these.

No, I don't hold out much hope
for the small people against the

01:24:16.866 --> 01:24:19.480
giants. The Giants don't seem to
be very intelligent.

eyed this time, which was

01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:24.720
something.
