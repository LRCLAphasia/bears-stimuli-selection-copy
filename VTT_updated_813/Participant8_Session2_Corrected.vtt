00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.174
OK, welcome to the second

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:14.899
you're going to see two types of

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:40.781
it is for us to create those

I see a luggage carrier bringing
luggage to the airplane gassing

work, or they're just relaxing.

player in the background, but I

0de82b25-bad7-45d7-8191-a756207c24ca-1
00:10:16.413 --> 00:10:18.670

OK, let's see what is
happening. #START_flowerman

7845dfd7-f440-4b0f-b9e0-8a1acb400813-1
00:10:42.044 --> 00:10:46.308
OK, I see a very dark scene.
Looks like it's cold. There's an

00:10:46.308 --> 00:10:50.504
old woman crossing over a small
bridge with an animal. Looks

00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:54.837
like she has a suitcase. Then
there's a big ditch with the car

7845dfd7-f440-4b0f-b9e0-8a1acb400813-4
00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:55.249
in it.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.994
Looks like the car fell, drove
off the road. I see a gas

72cbddf2-e904-4a30-bfa3-d9618e0c1fa9-1
00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:08.587

a truck man walking on the

00:11:13.334 --> 00:11:16.780
station attendant. Ferris wheel
on the back.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.790
A residential area with people
hanging their laundry.

d971efef-a2ee-47be-bfab-398473dd0184-0
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.787
It looks like there's an animal
inside the ditch, but I can't

d971efef-a2ee-47be-bfab-398473dd0184-1
00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:28.770
make out what it is.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.127
OK. And a tent and it looks like
a tent in the background. OK,

bc5a75f1-5d6e-440a-88e5-0f1f439c1570-1
00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:37.810
OK, like a circus.

9ee3e107-ebf5-458b-8a12-c2776b37a02a-0
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.656
I mean, it looks like a woman. I
can't tell it's a woman or man,

9ee3e107-ebf5-458b-8a12-c2776b37a02a-1
00:11:42.656 --> 00:11:43.550
but on the street

196f6c43-128c-4442-8e5c-aed56fb989b6-0
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.528
Looks like there's a couple off
to the left. One looks like

196f6c43-128c-4442-8e5c-aed56fb989b6-1
00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:50.930

I see a cafe with some people in
it. Man on the outside, person

96d43c6c-d955-4612-a48b-edc574a3ebfd-1
00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:05.754
on a motorcycle or bike.
Another. It looks like a little

96d43c6c-d955-4612-a48b-edc574a3ebfd-2
00:12:05.754 --> 00:12:07.609
boy walking in the street.

141a8468-c8e9-452f-b787-28d66386c577-0
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.130
An animal on top of a roof looks
like a monkey.

8f91e2d2-25c9-4f44-9ecd-548676317cf5-0
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.350
And then?

d8a2c07d-3eb8-481b-bcbe-d64dc16cdc5a-0
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.120
Looks like there's a person on
the balcony down below.

b8309216-a6e2-4904-8da5-bb3e216f59fe-0
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.435
OK, so it looks like the woman
is traveling through the city.

b8309216-a6e2-4904-8da5-bb3e216f59fe-1
00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:35.160
Or a man. Now it looks like a
man, OK

76ad6e1e-8cf2-4935-987c-8e29f646f463-0
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.767

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.040
Looks like there's a restaurant
to the left of the man.

04393f05-8f8a-4858-ae23-c6a620987a2b-0
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.025
A city scene. A man in a window
looks like he's sitting down for

04393f05-8f8a-4858-ae23-c6a620987a2b-1
00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:01.550

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.910
And other people too, and their
window still looks like a A.

a9e5ec82-829f-4765-a4bf-92aa70cc024d-0
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.390

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.090
It looks like I see an artist
getting ready to paint.

c18be10c-20bb-4dc6-86f1-84f4f0ae4b3f-0
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.850
A man and a child by the water
fountain.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.312
See a telescope on top of a one
of the apartments in one of the

6f54ca9a-fb05-42b5-ae32-3810daf221b6-1
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:34.130
buildings.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.830
OK. OK.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.820
woman with a child that looks
like walking into a house.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.250
Hmm.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.280
OK, I see the man he's on. Looks
like he's fixing his shutter for

eac0912a-3581-4936-badc-d559c7d353ed-1
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.362
the house that he saw for sale.
So apparently it looks like

eac0912a-3581-4936-badc-d559c7d353ed-2
00:13:56.362 --> 00:14:00.580
maybe he bought the house or he
is fixing it up. A city scene

eac0912a-3581-4936-badc-d559c7d353ed-3
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.002

looks like the daytime now. Man

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.332
And it looks like the man that
is on the ladder reflecting the

ed089306-9d20-49ca-985f-c9e17bb0f34e-1
00:15:04.332 --> 00:15:07.760
shutter is doing yard work too.
He looks like he has a lawnmower

ed089306-9d20-49ca-985f-c9e17bb0f34e-2
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.136
out there, so it looks like he
bought the house or is fixing it

ed089306-9d20-49ca-985f-c9e17bb0f34e-3
00:15:11.136 --> 00:15:11.980

The house is in color,
everything else is in black and

937c11e2-617f-4dd1-bfef-8cafd477a623-1
00:15:21.705 --> 00:15:23.910

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.847
Same scene as far as people on
the street. Looks like there's a

d1b25527-8d83-4c20-8619-0a25b3eddf18-1
00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:32.050
suspicious guy by the lamppost.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.303
Maybe a robber. It looks like
the man is walking away from his

cc8119af-2a8a-41ce-b2d9-291b7f720283-1
00:15:38.303 --> 00:15:42.136

motorcycle or a moped. I see a

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:50.120
little girl. It looks like she's
in color. So maybe the man has a

cc8119af-2a8a-41ce-b2d9-291b7f720283-4
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.569
a relationship with the little
girl. Maybe that's his

cc8119af-2a8a-41ce-b2d9-291b7f720283-5
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:55.230
granddaughter or daughter.

vendor with a cart with food or

99debed3-fc9c-4aab-981f-cac91317b28c-3
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.580

I'm noticing not as many people
in their windows now looking out

de0410d0-f1c8-4aaf-a617-28a589400ec2-1
00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:41.320
because I guess it's getting
dark.

6af388ba-142f-4064-9f8d-50d939a9913b-0
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.196
And it looks like there's
another cart down here with

6af388ba-142f-4064-9f8d-50d939a9913b-1
00:21:47.196 --> 00:21:51.510
flowers and there's a dog on the
street in front of the house.

c4421766-2587-4057-b83c-be2183afe9b4-0
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.610
Um.

f8cede8f-a7b1-43e0-b021-70985f28ac4a-0
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.730
That the old man was in.

92d2259d-1935-46fe-84ec-2e1c98792c73-0
00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.340
OK.

4f725842-76b4-454e-b7b8-d20c6a4cc13c-0
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.610
Um.

b7f3c111-4fd5-4efd-a3fb-5b99788cb07a-0
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.770
It looks like the man is walking
down the street.

733d8bc8-f8e9-45ab-8811-27e0f0e1bfde-0
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.700
Be quiet on the street there is
a boy that is looking out.

e97f2c4d-e06f-41a9-9d26-eeb854329bac-0
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.860
And a man on a motorcycle with
another man next to him.

1c9ac28e-aa25-47b0-ba00-58a077142459-0
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.441
There's a cafe with a man
standing outside the cafe with a

1c9ac28e-aa25-47b0-ba00-58a077142459-1
00:22:31.441 --> 00:22:35.599
hat on, and then a couple is in
a window and they are. Looks

1c9ac28e-aa25-47b0-ba00-58a077142459-2
00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:39.825
like they're hugging or they're
dancing. Not too much else is

1c9ac28e-aa25-47b0-ba00-58a077142459-3
00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:43.847
going on. There's a family,
looks like a little boy, a man

1c9ac28e-aa25-47b0-ba00-58a077142459-4
00:22:43.847 --> 00:22:47.869
and a woman on their balcony,
and the older man is walking

1c9ac28e-aa25-47b0-ba00-58a077142459-5
00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:48.209
away.

446805c9-63c0-433c-affc-2c3d35d51e28-0
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.310
down the street.

844666a2-60e6-4a09-8e7b-24b082e032bc-0
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.780
Now we're back to black and
white a little bit.

8c866f1b-0894-4977-90de-ceb28e236b3d-0
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.890
I see an older man.

1c99305c-6c70-4b8b-9b4c-1c17be73019d-0
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.770
Looks like he's drinking with a
dog. People in the window.

1c99305c-6c70-4b8b-9b4c-1c17be73019d-1
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.730
There's a car in the street.

4fca4721-38f4-4432-bf8d-e0c7a6b49c88-0
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.540
Looks like a Baker.

5a3e6715-fb1a-4f6b-9e88-ce4c5ec9bd2d-0
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.840
And the man is in color and
looks like he's.

5b56bae3-dedc-4f93-982b-885158a7f997-0
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.012
Looking at something of flame
maybe? Not sure. Or an address.

5b56bae3-dedc-4f93-982b-885158a7f997-1
00:23:20.012 --> 00:23:24.219
And there's a dog and there's a
man that looks surprised looking

5b56bae3-dedc-4f93-982b-885158a7f997-2
00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:26.290
out the window at the older man.

3dd51103-4911-49ad-9b28-f33382cda9b7-0
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.150
Then I see a woman and a little
girl looking down at the man.

4feeeb12-a778-4f14-bb8d-dddde8decbed-0
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:38.862
With the note and in the
background there's a woman and a

4feeeb12-a778-4f14-bb8d-dddde8decbed-1
00:23:38.862 --> 00:23:43.792
man and a little girl. It looks
like out in the window and it

4feeeb12-a778-4f14-bb8d-dddde8decbed-2
00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:48.723
looks like I see a Baker, so
that must be a restaurant on the

4feeeb12-a778-4f14-bb8d-dddde8decbed-3
00:23:48.723 --> 00:23:49.280
corner.

1164feff-b4d1-4c24-9854-73857fc6fe87-0
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.660
OK.

49e19abf-0d79-4cf2-aa42-f908143d60af-0
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.923
And it looks like a woman or
young girl has a flower and

49e19abf-0d79-4cf2-aa42-f908143d60af-1
00:23:58.923 --> 00:24:02.673
she's getting ready to give it
to somebody, maybe to the older

49e19abf-0d79-4cf2-aa42-f908143d60af-2
00:24:02.673 --> 00:24:06.007
man. And there's another man
looking at the window with

49e19abf-0d79-4cf2-aa42-f908143d60af-3
00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:06.900
another flower.

48ca6e33-416e-4474-baaf-c6b4fb0a8bc0-0
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.990
The old man is
walking by, so I see him now. #END_flowerman 

e4f22cf1-4feb-4f2b-895d-edd6b7c74e70-0
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.980
OK, good. So that was the
story.

2525756d-f604-433b-a75e-1b3fc3678c90-0
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.840
I hope I told a good story.

cc373cf0-aea1-4435-a52e-f3c4a28beb75-0
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:22.790
Good.

d409b02b-2189-4132-908c-c552f7c12ed6-0
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:28.334
It was good to hear that.
Description of what you see is

d409b02b-2189-4132-908c-c552f7c12ed6-1
00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:33.178
really helpful. OK, OK, next
item. It is a longer, longer

d409b02b-2189-4132-908c-c552f7c12ed6-2
00:24:33.178 --> 00:24:38.105
graphic novel and the characters
are not a little, I guess

d409b02b-2189-4132-908c-c552f7c12ed6-3
00:24:38.105 --> 00:24:42.949
they're surreal. So you don't
have to spend a lot of time

d409b02b-2189-4132-908c-c552f7c12ed6-4
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:48.211
thinking of what exactly they
are. Just move quicker and still

d409b02b-2189-4132-908c-c552f7c12ed6-5
00:24:48.211 --> 00:24:52.219
describe what you see because
it's a bit long.

03075551-64e0-46c8-82ef-5ae8bac9cf29-0
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.180
#START_wanderer Um, I see it
man. Umm, I see two men in the

03075551-64e0-46c8-82ef-5ae8bac9cf29-1
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.510
picture. It looks like it's a.

d7903898-98ba-4e34-87f9-ee076a804c45-0
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:01.750


158baf8a-db2e-4625-ac0c-1d4db75405ea-0
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.748
Large hat it looks like, and
they're trying to put it

158baf8a-db2e-4625-ac0c-1d4db75405ea-1
00:25:07.748 --> 00:25:12.322
together. Man has a like a
costume on with a horn and the

158baf8a-db2e-4625-ac0c-1d4db75405ea-2
00:25:12.322 --> 00:25:16.817
other man has a striped shirt
on. It looks like a hat, a

158baf8a-db2e-4625-ac0c-1d4db75405ea-3
00:25:16.817 --> 00:25:21.470
larger hat or a boat. Then I see
a boat with this smaller.

beae8ae3-c346-4804-9bf5-d146f90d34b5-0
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.447
boat that they put together next
to the large boat. That's pretty

beae8ae3-c346-4804-9bf5-d146f90d34b5-1
00:25:26.447 --> 00:25:26.960
massive.

3bb20054-aaf6-4437-bae4-f4a0c9cabf29-0
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:28.870
OK.

a811e3e2-a648-425b-a0b3-6f53bf4a006a-0
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.260
Um, I see the sailboat that they
made.

fd4e68e2-400d-4ce0-b59d-0cc1fbc9d05d-0
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.065
And there's birds in the
picture. So the sailboat, the

fd4e68e2-400d-4ce0-b59d-0cc1fbc9d05d-1
00:25:41.065 --> 00:25:43.310
birds are flying above the
sailboat.

f1dc0415-290c-4b88-a8e9-aa797ca551a5-0
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.142
Then I see looks like to be
turtles and a bird. They're near

f1dc0415-290c-4b88-a8e9-aa797ca551a5-1
00:25:51.142 --> 00:25:55.150
the the sailboat hat. It looks
like that the two men made.

2856193c-75ec-4ef8-aac1-506fb2a9b21d-0
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.670
And then a larger.

6a8a5d44-1b84-43e8-a1ed-15329b058592-0
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.621
Larger fish, maybe a whale next
to the next to the boat hat, I'm

6a8a5d44-1b84-43e8-a1ed-15329b058592-1
00:26:04.621 --> 00:26:05.890
going to call it.

c207c757-5e6a-4abe-bba1-5ec06fed41bf-0
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:07.920


ecb0a495-7e8d-49a8-9994-857d4e01f001-0
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.671
Yeah, looks like a whale. It
looks like the boat is on top of

ecb0a495-7e8d-49a8-9994-857d4e01f001-1
00:26:14.671 --> 00:26:19.657
the whales tail underwater
scene. I see a shark and a bunch

ecb0a495-7e8d-49a8-9994-857d4e01f001-2
00:26:19.657 --> 00:26:23.230
of other sea creatures, fish and
sea life.

299be620-66c8-41f5-85b0-9e1669206863-0
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.080
Umm.

289c9367-e1e8-4f99-9af5-3004a890a064-0
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.600
The boat is moving along.

933fb783-3fff-47b0-ba46-955da24f8d2d-0
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.771
Below the boat is a bunch again,
sea creatures and sea life

933fb783-3fff-47b0-ba46-955da24f8d2d-1
00:26:34.771 --> 00:26:39.511
underneath. Looks like there's a
bunch of fish below the the

933fb783-3fff-47b0-ba46-955da24f8d2d-2
00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:39.900
boat.

421553cd-6c6e-4f81-a907-f6da5f6627bc-0
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:48.583
Um, looks like some kind of sea
creature. Underneath the boat I

421553cd-6c6e-4f81-a907-f6da5f6627bc-1
00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:50.370
see two fish kissing.

052bfedf-4ccc-498c-9e67-6b2d7898a7e3-0
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.648
And then the boat looks like
there's a fishing pole and it

052bfedf-4ccc-498c-9e67-6b2d7898a7e3-1
00:26:55.648 --> 00:26:57.300
looks like it caught a fish.

d3281fe6-2c9b-4b18-be75-6f14b68503ca-0
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.740
Um, looks like a sea mammal.

62c59d6a-ef34-4ad0-afcf-1d11bdcc041f-0
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.830
Or what do they call those?

5a569799-adb3-442a-b7c5-c68041aa665b-0
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:16.170
See seahorse? Yeah, on top of
the fish with a.

47a4db0b-7c44-4ac0-b191-98f9449b5a96-0
00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:21.968
Coral reef with a bunch of other
sea life underneath. Then it

47a4db0b-7c44-4ac0-b191-98f9449b5a96-1
00:27:21.968 --> 00:27:27.043
looks like there's a tail or a
eel. I'm not sure. Looks like

47a4db0b-7c44-4ac0-b191-98f9449b5a96-2
00:27:27.043 --> 00:27:29.540
the seahorses on the boat now.

f0f00127-88b9-4e8d-af5c-039ab42571a1-0
00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:33.870
Umm.

05f1fdc7-6db1-4075-9bd7-f303689366bf-0
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.160
They look like Pelicans.

a75173d1-e150-4ecf-b5dc-5cefb212876e-0
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.430
all up in a tree. Looks like a
tree. Can't tell.

67a1b71c-e037-4019-b3fd-1cf7db24fd96-0
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.030
And I still see the boat looks
like to be in the ocean.

d9a427a5-7f2f-4cd8-96f9-d775d052524e-0
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.190
the seahorse is still on the
boat.

362e3bf9-0efc-40ec-9885-ca5a81260dfe-0
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.110
Sea life down below. The boat is
moving along with this seahorse

362e3bf9-0efc-40ec-9885-ca5a81260dfe-1
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.100
still in it, and I with the
birds, with the Pelicans I I

362e3bf9-0efc-40ec-9885-ca5a81260dfe-2
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.800
would say.

e053ee2c-7674-4617-a87f-00c7ecea13fb-0
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.480
And a bunch of other fish sea
life down below.

53e46374-b4e5-48b5-b6a2-195e8b9f83c4-0
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.840
All right, the boat is moving
along long.

0ca60f91-066f-472c-9d5e-d1457dab50b2-0
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:27.580
There's a bird I see. Looks like
to be hands.

e0e1e445-82e4-4db9-bbd4-5892e2544a96-0
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.500
And a bunch of other sea
creatures.

9c1ff9d0-dda0-4e00-a069-dd39093e0e28-0
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.530
Some of them look pretty pretty
dangerous.

5729fa7c-ae12-4119-8fd6-c4cc5bba7fcb-0
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.250
Maybe an alligator, not sure.

e40ea9bd-f970-473d-93eb-0e6cda5a3c3c-0
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.030
Alright, I see the seahorse is
still in the.

c7707c51-4d4f-40fb-85c7-079927e76311-0
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.254
Still on the boat, then big sea
creature down below the sea

c7707c51-4d4f-40fb-85c7-079927e76311-1
00:28:52.254 --> 00:28:54.340
horse is looking out and.

31e6315b-d5be-4a97-963e-286e6c99f4fd-0
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.540
Next page over there's other
seahorse. There's three other

31e6315b-d5be-4a97-963e-286e6c99f4fd-1
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.724
seahorses there, and it looks
like the seahorse that was on

31e6315b-d5be-4a97-963e-286e6c99f4fd-2
00:29:01.724 --> 00:29:03.210
the boat is out of the boat.

951f0351-9dad-4664-b6c3-f8088ccf495a-0
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.650
And he lost his hat.

2fab8afa-3176-46cc-a399-9080402241f9-0
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.540
Looks to be a big whale.

9a2a7c22-43d7-448c-bde6-b52973513d04-0
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.370
The birds on it and the boat is
next to the whale.

841ad654-4ddd-43b5-bc66-5c4f48929619-0
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.103
Looks like the whale is standing
on top of a like a bunch of

841ad654-4ddd-43b5-bc66-5c4f48929619-1
00:29:22.103 --> 00:29:25.907
boats, or yeah, looks like a
bunch of boats. Maybe it's a it

841ad654-4ddd-43b5-bc66-5c4f48929619-2
00:29:25.907 --> 00:29:29.960
looks like he has lobster claws,
so he looks pretty menacing. He

841ad654-4ddd-43b5-bc66-5c4f48929619-3
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.826
might have destroyed the boats
that he's standing on and he's

841ad654-4ddd-43b5-bc66-5c4f48929619-4
00:29:33.826 --> 00:29:35.510
looking at the little boat.

daf04aa2-f026-44ac-9432-f594dd0ccf94-0
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.950
That looks like a hat, OK.

ed062c79-bd63-4cc5-97f4-856475b9b698-0
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:47.990
OK.

a94b8662-2e9c-49f9-96a1-09c5e048b338-0
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.183
The boat is moving along in the
ocean with a bunch of sea

a94b8662-2e9c-49f9-96a1-09c5e048b338-1
00:29:54.183 --> 00:29:58.455
creatures around. It looks to be
a cat jumping in the in the boat

a94b8662-2e9c-49f9-96a1-09c5e048b338-2
00:29:58.455 --> 00:29:59.750
I'm starting to see.

74f4a305-5bb6-4d57-9b0a-3cd406ae37f3-0
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:05.320
Different looking sea creatures
now. Zebras, elephants, tigers.

74f4a305-5bb6-4d57-9b0a-3cd406ae37f3-1
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.400
But they look like they're.

aa725c07-0244-4bfe-b2ea-4b767e31755c-0
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.200
They can. They can swim.

54fc8d35-7f4f-4621-a624-81e4389bca14-0
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.330
In the ocean.

b91bdb3a-00a8-40cf-ad73-9558c659fb5c-0
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.460
And birds. Looks like there's
birds flying fish.

545cbaa6-0cf0-4bc8-82eb-017ec4845c06-0
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.022
And it's night time now. The
boat's moving along and there's

545cbaa6-0cf0-4bc8-82eb-017ec4845c06-1
00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.450
a bunch of fish underneath it.

37d918af-92e6-49ea-a3c2-b2ac6761f620-0
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.830
Pretty stars in the background.

9eb16cce-62f6-4b3b-9704-8b48ba4cd2c6-0
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.580
Looks like the fish are
surrounding the boat.

421e1ab4-27a9-47ab-8ba2-cb5fcf4f0875-0
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.000
Really can't see water, but I'm
assuming it's still in water.

4156bf16-039d-4725-b478-0192cf960b5e-0
00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.805
And it looks like it's just
surrounded it. It can't go

4156bf16-039d-4725-b478-0192cf960b5e-1
00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:49.660
anywhere by the because of the
fish.

5f0f31dd-58c6-4119-b48d-78070ff108d9-0
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.558
Looks like the fish let him go
and still the boat is still in

5f0f31dd-58c6-4119-b48d-78070ff108d9-1
00:30:56.558 --> 00:30:57.110
the water.

5df77893-42f1-49c7-a9f3-209ea61946f0-0
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.020
And it looks like a.

fd389d35-343b-4ef6-99e6-2b8d9d0b7dac-0
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.590
Is it the borealis?

308bd0ca-8170-46da-9652-d5864ed384c4-0
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:13.130
Possibly with stars starlit sky
and the fish are jumping up, up

308bd0ca-8170-46da-9652-d5864ed384c4-1
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.320
and up out of the water.

bb46748a-52d7-4402-b710-4a0be5cb67be-0
00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.257
Could be an iceberg, not sure,
but the boat is heading towards

bb46748a-52d7-4402-b710-4a0be5cb67be-1
00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:24.420
it.

686fcd52-457b-4155-afe6-cf68dfde8742-0
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.778
Looks to be looks to be colder
water. Looks like there's ice

686fcd52-457b-4155-afe6-cf68dfde8742-1
00:31:34.778 --> 00:31:39.194
build up in in the ocean now
it's going through a some sort

686fcd52-457b-4155-afe6-cf68dfde8742-2
00:31:39.194 --> 00:31:39.930
of tunnel.

e67f96c5-9b3c-4c49-b703-82a99b09a4ef-0
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.210
There's a light.

63e1448d-9fe4-4173-bcc3-e0d1d2abb93f-0
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.840
Looks to be a light that's
lighting the boat.

e8ab3e3e-073f-46dc-b17b-60d1d176acdc-0
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.940
Still past the iceberg?

b701b41b-7fb4-4da9-a8b2-1ce3cec11bcf-0
00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:03.114
Looks like a creature that
picked up the boat with a light

b701b41b-7fb4-4da9-a8b2-1ce3cec11bcf-1
00:32:03.114 --> 00:32:03.780
on it.

b2a6af41-ac35-47e5-9a2c-e1d70166296f-0
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.310
OK, looks like a scuba diver.

b837ee60-5595-4b77-bc13-0659686441ac-0
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.100
And the boat might be in
trouble.

b0f704e8-f391-4adc-83d2-d8d76110f100-0
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.080
The larger boat, the the little
boat is going towards it.

7870f17c-6030-4cf2-93a0-b5e98357a1a5-0
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.170
Looks like the scuba diver is
shining a light on the bigger

7870f17c-6030-4cf2-93a0-b5e98357a1a5-1
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:29.490
boat.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:30.950
OK.

370197f7-8fab-417c-a8ad-231564df32d6-0
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.797
Lots of birds in the picture.
Looks like maybe one of the

370197f7-8fab-417c-a8ad-231564df32d6-1
00:32:37.797 --> 00:32:39.120

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.720
Looks like they're going towards
a factory on the water.

f24644f0-e5ab-435f-bc17-2d7165c77222-0
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.850

Men shooting rifles down at
another man on a smaller boat,

92177af7-e660-4ea6-a025-2ef5f1d2747a-1
00:33:05.155 --> 00:33:10.340

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.463
Looks like a big crane in the
background. Don't know if it's

e45ed2b0-d773-476d-8af9-007c7bf06ebe-1
00:33:19.463 --> 00:33:23.467
going to attack anybody. And
then I see a man in another

e45ed2b0-d773-476d-8af9-007c7bf06ebe-2

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.407

airplane. So that is a paper
boat then.

2057e233-4e78-4c54-a755-5adcc985e23f-0

But it's not there. They're
probably sea creatures. In the

267c0a41-2533-42c8-b527-18a59c90648f-1
00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:07.652

00:35:45.094 --> 00:35:48.780
Then there's another one.
There's another creature.

843dfbeb-0f0e-44ef-8451-e1bfa2b07ead-1
00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:56.700
guess wearing underwear.

92fe5eed-ab8c-4329-9f81-df9e71033a3e-0
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.090
Sitting on the beach, looks like
he was drinking and eating.

56d27b6e-4a54-4b01-9fec-930b5377c9c8-0
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.659
Ohh paper boat with jellyfish
around it surrounded by looks

56d27b6e-4a54-4b01-9fec-930b5377c9c8-1
00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:13.050
like he's getting attacked by
it.

c6bdfe9c-003a-4e36-95d5-ac4855c4ddee-0
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.990
On both pages.

or or just one?}

184b291c-343e-4162-aa77-08650ed9b0ce-0
00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.465
OK, so looks like the sea boat.
I mean, the paper boat is by the

184b291c-343e-4162-aa77-08650ed9b0ce-1
00:36:32.465 --> 00:36:36.590
fish now and then. It looks like
it's getting ready to encounter

184b291c-343e-4162-aa77-08650ed9b0ce-2
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.240
with another sea creature.

it. They're they're on the boat

a1f6234d-da66-4d0f-9a4a-e55ab0e81306-1
00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:51.389
on the paper boat. Looks like
they're looking at it. Then it

a1f6234d-da66-4d0f-9a4a-e55ab0e81306-2
00:36:51.389 --> 00:36:55.995
looks like there's a submarine
with the with the boat with the

a1f6234d-da66-4d0f-9a4a-e55ab0e81306-3
00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:56.800
paper boat.

00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:05.727
it was like a scuba diver in the
upper right hand corner. Bunch

2abf1096-57fc-43ab-8611-b3308c7fc71a-2
00:37:05.727 --> 00:37:07.160
of scuba divers actually.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.300
Either that or fish, I can't
tell.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.600
Looks like the submarine is
coming above water.

faec897c-1b51-492c-82a8-f514849a4da0-0
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:27.117
Looks like it's actually saves
the paper, because now it's

faec897c-1b51-492c-82a8-f514849a4da0-1
00:37:27.117 --> 00:37:32.432
emptying the water out of the
boat with fish below looks like

faec897c-1b51-492c-82a8-f514849a4da0-2
00:37:32.432 --> 00:37:33.290

are attacking another boat, like
a fishing boat possibly, and the

af374a90-7adc-48cf-b14c-c00ec3c7e895-1
00:37:39.606 --> 00:37:41.390
paper boat is behind it.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.950
Looks like sea lions or seals
there. Looks like they're

fadebce8-305d-4e7b-9655-db027b09491f-1
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.749
playing with the paper boat now.
It's like they're having fun

fadebce8-305d-4e7b-9655-db027b09491f-2
00:37:53.749 --> 00:37:55.709
with it and a bunch of sea life.

Moving along and then down below
the boat there is a looks like a

70b487ac-075c-4f0b-9769-8acc6e8f90bc-1

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:35.051
Some sort of boat with it? I'm
not sure, but it has a suction

b9bdd922-c245-4719-bb66-708ffbb6991e-1
00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:35.420
cup.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.940
It looks like that's connected
to one of the fish.

49022670-f050-4611-8669-b4ce612ef57c-0
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.328
Looks like a buoy with birds
coming on it, with sea creatures

On a sea creature.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:24.209
But I do see a big bridge and
other boats going towards it.

02d8d6ef-ace9-48a1-bc85-0841d389a961-1
00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:26.790

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:32.723
Um, they're going towards it.
There's 1 2 3 boats and a sail,

0a89cc66-00cc-4614-97da-e3045518c8b3-1

a sailboat next to it.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:58.679
Looks like it might collide with
it with the with the submarine

89677e05-b11d-46aa-84a0-6995d5ac021b-1
00:39:58.679 --> 00:39:59.300

Looks like the paper boat is
back in the picture next to the

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.090
Looks like the submarine.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:24.001
Looks like a submarine? I can't
tell, but I see a man and a

5600f51e-7b28-4253-8630-46f812660252-1
00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:28.392
woman on the dock. Looks like
it's on a pier with the crane

5600f51e-7b28-4253-8630-46f812660252-2
00:41:28.392 --> 00:41:31.100

7e8c60ec-ab2d-48e4-ad21-de76197c46b3-1
00:41:52.672 --> 00:41:58.221
boat. Then there's a net, looks
like there's a sea creature in

7e8c60ec-ab2d-48e4-ad21-de76197c46b3-2
00:41:58.221 --> 00:41:58.750
there.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:06.160
And and a man could be a
fisherman or just a boatman.

b4e63948-dc9e-4e1a-9905-dcff58d8f2dc-0
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.972

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.190
Looks like a night scene. The
paper boat is in an area. It

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.029
The city now, so I guess it's
getting ready to dock with a

c60ff39a-1f14-406f-9961-5a7994fc4312-1
00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.060
boat going past it.

with wings.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.040
That's getting ready to step off
the tower.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.190

big creatures, the scuba man and
a cat.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:36.200
It looks like a jester is on a
step welcoming the boat

1d17ac1a-f276-4e25-a302-b4d0fff6f11d-0
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:41.470
Looks like the boat's gone
through a canal and there's

1d17ac1a-f276-4e25-a302-b4d0fff6f11d-1
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.367
there's a man there sitting on
the step with people in the

1d17ac1a-f276-4e25-a302-b4d0fff6f11d-2
00:43:44.367 --> 00:43:45.840
background on top of the step.

082028ce-5179-44e0-bed9-cae8f4c088b5-0
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.490
Looks like the the the paper
boats making its way through the

082028ce-5179-44e0-bed9-cae8f4c088b5-1
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.010
canal now.

52d5bcae-1b22-4786-9a50-b2fe2e732b5f-0
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:56.710
Uh.

480d642a-750d-4e87-bf6f-0a47b7254d4a-0
00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:02.873
Coming across another vessel and
fish looking at it, they look

480d642a-750d-4e87-bf6f-0a47b7254d4a-1
00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:07.492
like they're they're surprised.
It looks like a small fishing

480d642a-750d-4e87-bf6f-0a47b7254d4a-2
00:44:07.492 --> 00:44:10.770
boat that's docked to the left
of the boat.

d70328fe-fff1-495e-9608-6c99d7274ffb-0
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.210
Under the canal.

bd79fb58-2663-43d8-81a1-cffe968a619b-0
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.330
That is a house that's lit up by
a lamppost.

ad9b409e-86ea-4770-a8c4-d34d97309227-0
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.799
Up on a brick dock it looks like
and the boat looks like it's

ad9b409e-86ea-4770-a8c4-d34d97309227-1
00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:31.518
docking and a man is getting out
of the boat and going up the

ad9b409e-86ea-4770-a8c4-d34d97309227-2
00:44:31.518 --> 00:44:35.670
steps and I see feet at the top
of the dock.

The story let's take a 10
minute break, OK? Come back at

f32d578e-e4b3-434c-a027-9b54a0629ccf-1

Thank you.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.203
OK. So we're moving on to the
next items. We have 26 in

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.390
And we're on 18 right now.

1313fe48-6a0c-474a-811d-4c21f074c183-0
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:18.453
This is a graphic novel, so
please describe what you see as

1313fe48-6a0c-474a-811d-4c21f074c183-1
00:45:18.453 --> 00:45:23.051
you go through the story. OK?
#START_arrival_1 I see a man and

1313fe48-6a0c-474a-811d-4c21f074c183-2
00:45:23.051 --> 00:45:26.860
a woman, husband and wife for
the child, a daughter.

f0da1bae-7657-46c2-a14c-6585af57354c-0
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.000
it is a picture.

b1f58f75-b0a9-475b-be7b-08849f7b91c8-0
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.181
It looks like they're wrapping
it up, maybe sending it as a

b1f58f75-b0a9-475b-be7b-08849f7b91c8-1
00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:34.470
gift.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.010
Umm.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.370
OK. And then a.

f4a751a6-bd57-4cb0-9fb2-48f0098d60f5-0
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.800
Picture of a bird, a clock, a
hat.

08390fec-1124-4023-b05c-8353fbdde36c-0
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.630
Some sort of cooking where
cookware?

e41cb44b-80bd-4d7c-911c-b7eda535fffd-0
00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.090
A picture of the.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.935
A picture that somebody drew of
the of the man and the woman and

91bf7268-05f7-4eca-baf0-e261abef52a3-1
00:46:07.935 --> 00:46:11.380
the child a teapot, it looks
like or kettle.

9e2d28d4-4023-4a6e-a0a6-2b7042a68cf6-0
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:22.353
A cup of coffee or tea, probably
tea, looks like to be a picture

9e2d28d4-4023-4a6e-a0a6-2b7042a68cf6-1
00:46:22.353 --> 00:46:23.340
of a boat.

f665fa40-0d4d-48e2-97dc-b593ba4d360f-0
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:28.848
Looks like somebody's going to
travel somewhere or sending

f665fa40-0d4d-48e2-97dc-b593ba4d360f-1
00:46:28.848 --> 00:46:33.167
something off and a picture of
the man and the woman and the

00:46:33.167 --> 00:46:35.080
child. A daughter, I guess.

d75550f9-cefa-475a-a580-e4d2a3da7386-0
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.720
It looks like a man and a woman
are getting ready to.

c6b659e4-773e-4b58-b8fc-251172ba7dea-0
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.210
Either open up or send.

1a1c0380-ce02-4b53-948c-4172da0eac75-0
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:51.354
Something out. It looks like a
suitcase, so somebody's going on

1a1c0380-ce02-4b53-948c-4172da0eac75-1
00:46:51.354 --> 00:46:51.800
trip.

703d4279-7e0a-46db-a7e8-b36acd3a83e7-0
00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.323
Looks like the daughter is
waking, sleeping, waking up,

703d4279-7e0a-46db-a7e8-b36acd3a83e7-1
00:47:00.323 --> 00:47:03.927
having breakfast. She might be
going on a trip. A man looks

703d4279-7e0a-46db-a7e8-b36acd3a83e7-2
00:47:03.927 --> 00:47:07.891
like he's leaving. The woman had
gotten dressed. Looks like she's

703d4279-7e0a-46db-a7e8-b36acd3a83e7-3
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:11.375
getting the girl ready to go
somewhere. It looks like all

703d4279-7e0a-46db-a7e8-b36acd3a83e7-4
00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:14.919
three of them are going on a
trip and they're walking down

703d4279-7e0a-46db-a7e8-b36acd3a83e7-5
00:47:14.919 --> 00:47:15.580
the street.

fbbaca89-56d3-4d11-83a6-daeb4108430d-0
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.635
And there's a shadow of a
dragon, it looks like in the

fbbaca89-56d3-4d11-83a6-daeb4108430d-1
00:47:19.635 --> 00:47:20.130
background.

1969bf2c-e55e-4bce-b4d4-8792ae107ba8-0
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:27.151
Uh, looks like the girl might be
a little scared. She's holding

1969bf2c-e55e-4bce-b4d4-8792ae107ba8-1
00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:31.284
on to her parents hand real
tight. They've gotten to the

1969bf2c-e55e-4bce-b4d4-8792ae107ba8-2
00:47:31.284 --> 00:47:32.300
train station.

556f38e0-b7a6-4ec9-ab7d-787d13d8fb8a-0
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.984
Looks like the man is talking to
the daughter. Uh, he's trying to

556f38e0-b7a6-4ec9-ab7d-787d13d8fb8a-1
00:47:38.984 --> 00:47:42.625
make a laugh for the paper bird
and his and his head looks like

556f38e0-b7a6-4ec9-ab7d-787d13d8fb8a-2
00:47:42.625 --> 00:47:45.981
he's going to give it to her.
{I'm going to move this real

556f38e0-b7a6-4ec9-ab7d-787d13d8fb8a-3
00:47:45.981 --> 00:47:46.380
quick.}

f6b9a0b1-32ea-498f-a779-02690604209f-0
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.210
Um, looks like the mother is
upset.

d4438f20-033b-4de3-89ff-d4022fb43eac-0
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.760
Looks like the father is saying
goodbye to his family, to the to

d4438f20-033b-4de3-89ff-d4022fb43eac-1
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.400
his wife and to his child as he
boards the train.

6cfbb0fd-6c48-43f4-a664-3ef9169fa2e6-0
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.900
The man is sitting, eating,
looking at the picture of his

6cfbb0fd-6c48-43f4-a664-3ef9169fa2e6-1
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:12.410
family.

a37e073b-f94b-4f6f-944e-cc8085e9c5ba-0
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.370
Looks like he's having soup for
dinner.

55921e34-766a-474d-9151-93d6f210b433-0
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.600
Now he looks like he's on a
boat.

9453b71a-73d1-45a4-bae7-7e4db931be2a-0
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.550
So he went from a train to a
boat

bfcc01ca-19cb-4522-adb0-8f9ca5e17134-0
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.909
And he is still
on transportation here he is

bfcc01ca-19cb-4522-adb0-8f9ca5e17134-1
00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:29.500
going somewhere on a trip. #END_arrival_1 

03868ab6-77b4-42ab-9d76-96982c8bbc72-0
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.119
That was that part of the
story. Now we can move on to the

03868ab6-77b4-42ab-9d76-96982c8bbc72-1
00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:41.654
next item. It's also a story.
Um, again, describe what you see

03868ab6-77b4-42ab-9d76-96982c8bbc72-2
00:48:41.654 --> 00:48:43.310
and what is happening.

9fc8face-eda4-458e-88ae-a5aa6c6178e7-0
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:51.116
#START_journey OK, I see boys
high five each other on a bike

9fc8face-eda4-458e-88ae-a5aa6c6178e7-1
00:48:51.116 --> 00:48:55.850
and a girl on a skateboard and
another boy.

5ffdc95d-ad64-4da1-9ebc-8683d1b0a3f8-0
00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.908
Standing there on the street
looks like he has a skateboard

5ffdc95d-ad64-4da1-9ebc-8683d1b0a3f8-1
00:49:01.908 --> 00:49:03.490
or some kind of motorbike.

c6644355-4b69-455b-bb48-5fd0c4e4f948-0
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:08.460
Looks a little depressed, maybe
looking for a friend?

e105b165-2c3f-4c23-a762-20b9a0867856-0
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:15.694
And then I see a man in an
apartment sitting at his

e105b165-2c3f-4c23-a762-20b9a0867856-1
00:49:15.694 --> 00:49:16.590
computer.

0531bb4f-6c1a-4fd2-a9a2-92e228671e11-0
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.860
And it looks like a.

7ec6ecdd-69d3-4702-a8cd-d2696e1643d8-0
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.553
Girl sitting on a couch looking
at something, maybe something on

7ec6ecdd-69d3-4702-a8cd-d2696e1643d8-1
00:49:25.553 --> 00:49:27.870
her phone, and it looks like the
mother's cooking.

9af69256-4ee6-480e-91fd-d79dc7521100-0
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.031
Um, looks like the mother is
making dinner and the little

9af69256-4ee6-480e-91fd-d79dc7521100-1
00:49:38.031 --> 00:49:42.216
girl or a little boy is by the
mother. Looks like she's busy on

9af69256-4ee6-480e-91fd-d79dc7521100-2
00:49:42.216 --> 00:49:46.204
the phone cooking the man. I
guess the father is busy on his

9af69256-4ee6-480e-91fd-d79dc7521100-3
00:49:46.204 --> 00:49:50.192
computer and it looks like the
girl wants to play or the boy

9af69256-4ee6-480e-91fd-d79dc7521100-4
00:49:50.192 --> 00:49:54.180
wants to play. Looks like his
sister is looking at a camera.

203b0d81-0488-4335-a6b9-5ecc3edc4215-0
00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:00.281
And it looks like the little boy
wants to play with somebody. Now

203b0d81-0488-4335-a6b9-5ecc3edc4215-1
00:50:00.281 --> 00:50:02.420
he's sitting in his room
depressed

700d6385-eb38-4039-b8a8-531361972e0a-0
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:07.127
I'll call the child because I
can't tell if it's a boy or

700d6385-eb38-4039-b8a8-531361972e0a-1
00:50:07.127 --> 00:50:07.360
girl.

41f5821f-fc6c-4b41-9aed-dbda1a406326-0
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.900
sitting in his room

d621d14d-46b2-4deb-9e7b-2e27432c7b67-0
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.790
With the cat relaxing.

7a0cce2b-9eba-4aa7-99d0-650c456d515e-0
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.460
Umm.

65113aed-f63a-4ce0-9f8e-e81daad885de-0
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:22.715
The child looks startled. The
cat walks out of the room, looks

65113aed-f63a-4ce0-9f8e-e81daad885de-1
00:50:22.715 --> 00:50:24.240
like papers blew over.

b221e5a2-ac27-4000-81ef-fb803844b195-0
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:27.200
Now it looks like.

748942e7-54a0-497c-94ea-74b7b6519c84-0
00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:32.234
The child is getting ready to
Draw Something on a wall, a door

748942e7-54a0-497c-94ea-74b7b6519c84-1
00:50:32.234 --> 00:50:32.930
to escape.

b1c11fb2-fb88-4bf1-b118-0298569ef838-0
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:40.468
Looks like he's in a fantasy
land now. Out of a tree came out

b1c11fb2-fb88-4bf1-b118-0298569ef838-1
00:50:40.468 --> 00:50:44.720
of the tree and a fantasy land
with lights with lots of lights.

714e90e6-d091-4022-a518-f213fb8b3c6b-0
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:49.640
Looks pretty interesting.

57ec583a-8ac7-485d-9cf3-441919ed8b41-0
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.930
OK.

93ed0470-c663-4433-9427-15caaf3df9e6-0
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:59.580
 standing on the child, standing
on it on a dock.

5a94edf1-11c3-4fa8-b0b0-89ed88990cc1-0
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:06.758
With the something that he drew
with it earlier, see something

5a94edf1-11c3-4fa8-b0b0-89ed88990cc1-1
00:51:06.758 --> 00:51:12.299
in the water, now it's drawing a
boat on a dock. It's going to go

5a94edf1-11c3-4fa8-b0b0-89ed88990cc1-2
00:51:12.299 --> 00:51:14.230
on a boat off the dock.

c42ca755-871a-4a2f-af05-d900350faa19-0
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.950
The boat that he drew.

1e8f4643-1288-44dc-9300-bf99675e46a2-0
00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:22.238
And it looks like he's entering
a Moat and a big castle. Pretty

1e8f4643-1288-44dc-9300-bf99675e46a2-1
00:51:22.238 --> 00:51:23.020
adventurous.

c4db9a69-2c78-405e-afc9-78d09bd3711d-0
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.100
And he looks like he entered
into the castle.

22bf6389-b6bd-4df3-9a24-6be11f319375-0
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:38.831
Looks like he's being welcomed
by officers or soldiers and

22bf6389-b6bd-4df3-9a24-6be11f319375-1
00:51:38.831 --> 00:51:40.470
still on the boat.

5983991a-facf-4467-a3e8-c4bf93292ac0-0
00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.530
And there looks to be like a
water canal.

6074ae30-25a2-4f9f-9451-3b290a4904c2-0
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.860
With other boats and people on
it.

a8a579cd-96b4-408b-8bdb-2a82378e04b3-0
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.250
Hmm.

20e45cc7-ad93-44ae-9d31-637d2a5f9521-0
00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:02.251
Alright, looks like the child
has gone off the waterfall.

20e45cc7-ad93-44ae-9d31-637d2a5f9521-1
00:52:02.251 --> 00:52:07.580
Looks pretty steep drawing a not
sure what he's drawing.

0aaecc21-c275-40b2-a591-61168fd7d1df-0
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.410
But it is above the boat.

5ffcd494-433c-4c6b-9e6e-627c3e37968c-0
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.890
Ohh is it a balloon? People
waving goodbye.

9a3f1194-0cb9-4bb9-a62f-ddc15d61cd01-0
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:27.640
Now he's on another little
episode here with.

d3173799-eb18-4110-86dd-4afc471016d7-0
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.870
Looks like to be a boat in the
sky.

904d4fa1-f579-4e10-897d-2a5c0eadd221-0
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:39.270
So he's flying above the clouds
now.

a89dc0fb-2841-4212-a018-4e0b24bddf57-0
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:47.600
Still on the balloon that he
drew.

86d1b9eb-2aa1-416f-b46b-d846034f5c3e-0
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:53.979
Looks like to be another air
vessel up in the air and then

86d1b9eb-2aa1-416f-b46b-d846034f5c3e-1
00:52:53.979 --> 00:52:54.910
down below.

2b71cebc-9600-45c1-aaca-fd1bf8996052-0
00:52:56.230 --> 00:53:00.418
It looks like to be a big vessel
still still above the clouds,

2b71cebc-9600-45c1-aaca-fd1bf8996052-1
00:53:00.418 --> 00:53:02.080
and then it looks like a.

7df9609e-ee17-4518-b6d1-88bca44230b7-0
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.460
Man pointing a gun.

8a7b7de6-b08d-4f29-a5eb-a7134d27a1b5-0
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.266
And some kind of boat that's in
the air with three other

8a7b7de6-b08d-4f29-a5eb-a7134d27a1b5-1
00:53:15.266 --> 00:53:17.520
creatures and a bird flying.

19b93398-5cc7-4cea-ac35-f46aaf58d70a-0
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.290
{Can you describe a little bit
more of what's happening here?}

2bfc4239-56d2-4466-a16a-d39c638c9e1f-0
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.058
Yeah, it looks like the king is
on a some kind of air vessel or

2bfc4239-56d2-4466-a16a-d39c638c9e1f-1
00:53:33.058 --> 00:53:36.950
blimp or balloon itself and it
looks like the.

a0a1e416-d6ab-44df-a779-ff4e2760ff1c-0
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.918
One of the men on the boat has a
net. Looks like it wants to

a0a1e416-d6ab-44df-a779-ff4e2760ff1c-1
00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:43.180
capture the bird. Possibly.

0121558d-e276-4fbe-bf42-7361f9569edc-0
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.190
It looks like the bird and there
was a bird cage on the on the

0121558d-e276-4fbe-bf42-7361f9569edc-1
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.830
boat, so they were trying to get
the bird back I guess.

3b26b7ba-2640-44f0-9e9b-83f17d7df202-0
00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:57.180
The child is now is in the
balloon and it sees the.

f7952062-7a71-4147-bd7c-6e623624db96-0
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.486
vessel with the three men. The
one man looks like he's pointing

f7952062-7a71-4147-bd7c-6e623624db96-1
00:54:04.486 --> 00:54:09.123
a gun, and it looks like the
creature I thought it was a

f7952062-7a71-4147-bd7c-6e623624db96-2
00:54:09.123 --> 00:54:09.530
bird.

b561fa5d-7483-44e0-82e4-8d8e5d7a43e4-0
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:15.538
Is in a cage and it's being
lifted up into another vessel,

b561fa5d-7483-44e0-82e4-8d8e5d7a43e4-1
00:54:15.538 --> 00:54:16.360
air vessel.

41034ac9-d100-4a20-8fcc-c93c5a9cb294-0
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:18.770
And then?

b9f66313-59e6-42f3-ad31-1a05b71f2cb4-0
00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:24.900
The vessel is moving along up in
the clouds.

33c744d9-f40e-4cdc-8a0a-9f70be1729de-0
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.500
With the gold.

894f0d74-6081-44ad-8c13-25905acbedfa-0
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.670
Looks like a statue.

68102225-be9f-4221-b23a-af5ace4a996b-0
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:34.560
On on the boat.

b85c36eb-62ec-4c12-88d2-f356e70eadce-0
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:43.415
Looks like the boy is running
away or came off the balloon.

b85c36eb-62ec-4c12-88d2-f356e70eadce-1
00:54:43.415 --> 00:54:47.895
Still has the crayon or marker
that he's using the magic his

b85c36eb-62ec-4c12-88d2-f356e70eadce-2
00:54:47.895 --> 00:54:52.374
magic Draw pen. I guess you want
to call it. He's moving. He

b85c36eb-62ec-4c12-88d2-f356e70eadce-3
00:54:52.374 --> 00:54:54.210
landed on the big vessel.

19c6da39-3b9b-46ef-8e3b-98a0e34ea76b-0
00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:02.046
Now that looks like the bird is
that's in a bird cage is being

19c6da39-3b9b-46ef-8e3b-98a0e34ea76b-1
00:55:02.046 --> 00:55:07.327
guarded by two soldiers, and the
boy is climbing up a ladder,

19c6da39-3b9b-46ef-8e3b-98a0e34ea76b-2
00:55:07.327 --> 00:55:10.650
possibly to save the to save the
bird.

deaae103-944e-4bfe-8aa5-406d35247c43-0
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.856
Yeah. The boy grabbed the bird
cage along with the bird, and

deaae103-944e-4bfe-8aa5-406d35247c43-1
00:55:16.856 --> 00:55:19.020
the soldiers are running after
him.

8e7d6210-7c67-4c4a-a561-b5a3636c804e-0
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.550
And the boy let.

8a16c9e1-9b18-4753-aaeb-03e1568e1051-0
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.046
the bird go the bird is free and
the soldiers are running after

8a16c9e1-9b18-4753-aaeb-03e1568e1051-1
00:55:30.046 --> 00:55:30.630
the boy.

2e32253d-955b-4aab-9e2f-172aec3881df-0
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:39.125
Looks like they captured the
boy, but the bird is gone and

2e32253d-955b-4aab-9e2f-172aec3881df-1
00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:43.896
his magic pen or Crayon is is
fell and there's a soldier who

2e32253d-955b-4aab-9e2f-172aec3881df-2
00:55:43.896 --> 00:55:46.400
who looked like he threw it off.

e8064abf-9ff2-4843-a65a-f10e46bbbab7-0
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.801
Now it looks like they have the
boy and the bird cage in the

e8064abf-9ff2-4843-a65a-f10e46bbbab7-1
00:55:51.801 --> 00:55:52.190
vessel.

b899d213-ba79-44be-a50d-5926ba1951dc-0
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.110
It's taking the boy away.

e353a8de-a3e9-4aac-a95b-9f41fba76be1-0
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:07.030
Looks like the bird saved his
magic pen or crayon.

e3781d6a-55e3-4754-be91-6082870b09d7-0
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:12.418
He's coming back for the boy,
probably to rescue so the boy

e3781d6a-55e3-4754-be91-6082870b09d7-1
00:56:12.418 --> 00:56:15.843
could Draw Something else to
free him and the bird away from

e3781d6a-55e3-4754-be91-6082870b09d7-2
00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:16.180
there.

5215071b-86df-4cdd-8c43-0ab604a0d884-0
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:19.540
Looks like he's very happy.

705f5809-2c68-4ea4-8d8c-e0451b9ab576-0
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:27.349
And it looks like the boy is
drawing something with the bird

705f5809-2c68-4ea4-8d8c-e0451b9ab576-1
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:28.120
next to him.

ce044a6a-969c-44b0-9d47-dad70ed2ff70-0
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.420
Possibly to plan their escape to
get out of there.

af4f063c-f479-49cc-973f-79b6a476ce89-0
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.316
I see the bird cage sitting
above and now the boys on magic

af4f063c-f479-49cc-973f-79b6a476ce89-1
00:56:41.316 --> 00:56:45.459
carpet and he's flying through
the air. Looks like he's just

af4f063c-f479-49cc-973f-79b6a476ce89-2
00:56:45.459 --> 00:56:47.430
escaping along with the bird.

c9a307d7-ca3a-46a8-9674-3c66b2665c0d-0
00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:55.455
{No comment on also the
background.} The background

c9a307d7-ca3a-46a8-9674-3c66b2665c0d-1
00:56:55.455 --> 00:57:00.490
there's a city below looks like
the castle over a city.

0e38d839-a976-4d19-ba77-c4dbc1928d50-0
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:04.800
With.

6a9f0af8-eaac-487b-ba14-bfd36ec8100a-0
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:10.950
I see people and horse.

019c4a1c-5afd-4ee1-9f25-b7fc348f6c32-0
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.950
Camel.

ff6bc6ca-7e5e-40ea-a580-969aedc06866-0
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.540
And the boys flying above the
city.

db1061a3-46ad-4185-a281-abab7e6c24f4-0
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.530
Now he looks like he's.

8b2c2c58-274d-4a0a-89d4-5d7e62756a2a-0
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:26.480
On a magic carpet.

be9399a0-fb7e-4a97-aba2-461a2855a0c5-0
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:32.209
Very pretty sky, and it looks
like the bird is free as well,

be9399a0-fb7e-4a97-aba2-461a2855a0c5-1
00:57:32.209 --> 00:57:35.250
and it looks like they're not in
trouble anymore.

6d6aae23-30e6-4f61-a6a1-17731586e275-0
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:38.620
Looks like they might be going.

1354f7ea-3a14-47ad-97cf-f35f0e49f282-0
00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.970
I'm not sure where they're
going.

5d57fb39-e751-4289-bc21-e1c1e99bf1dc-0
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:45.220
Maybe part of a desert?

fca1581e-629b-42b5-bbd5-b851dd0abbc0-0
00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:52.922
The boys had a tree. He's down
on the ground. He's had a tree

fca1581e-629b-42b5-bbd5-b851dd0abbc0-1
00:57:52.922 --> 00:57:55.890
with a door. The bird helped him

They're drawing something else.

e86b2a25-62a5-4d69-9d1d-cb571395b537-0
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:55.520
To go underwater with it looks
like a squid or an octopus.

c7231aa8-8ad8-434e-8a3f-6a8ccaecf9e9-0
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.388
OK, they're with the like a
flying octopus, I guess with

c7231aa8-8ad8-434e-8a3f-6a8ccaecf9e9-1
01:22:03.388 --> 01:22:07.598
scuba gear on that they drew a
lot, looks like the bird too as

c7231aa8-8ad8-434e-8a3f-6a8ccaecf9e9-2
01:22:07.598 --> 01:22:11.674
well. And it looks like they're
going to the monument. Maybe

c7231aa8-8ad8-434e-8a3f-6a8ccaecf9e9-3
01:22:11.674 --> 01:22:15.683
that's where the king is and it
looks like it's underwater.

c7231aa8-8ad8-434e-8a3f-6a8ccaecf9e9-4
01:22:15.683 --> 01:22:19.893
There's a soldiers, looks like
they're after the boys. They're

c7231aa8-8ad8-434e-8a3f-6a8ccaecf9e9-5
01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:24.170
holding on to the octopus that
they drew. The bird has a scoop.

8029abf6-80b4-488b-aacc-464e0f736b9e-0
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:29.530
The bird has a air tank too as
well.

68edbc1f-5d28-47fb-aa2c-7ea4daf66d66-0
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.770
And it looks like the boys are
being chased by the soldiers.

1ea2d158-ca64-44e6-bb38-d7e3f8f59302-0
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:38.410
{There's a another piece. Oh,
I'm sorry, I didn't see this. I

1ea2d158-ca64-44e6-bb38-d7e3f8f59302-1
01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:39.900
got. I went right to hear.}

97a51352-22d2-4f7a-9742-b086d5409b40-0
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:46.895
Yeah, it's a looks like a shell
that the boys found something

97a51352-22d2-4f7a-9742-b086d5409b40-1
01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.130
with the bird.

9a65d438-dbf5-41f7-8fc8-5fc19150d8a8-0
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:54.900
And it looks like they grabbed
it. I'm not sure.

b06c48db-e4f0-40b4-84ff-95b171e2601f-0
01:22:56.350 --> 01:23:00.264
And then they're off and running
away from the soldiers

b06c48db-e4f0-40b4-84ff-95b171e2601f-1
01:23:00.264 --> 01:23:04.528
underneath the water. All right,
they made it to the island.

b06c48db-e4f0-40b4-84ff-95b171e2601f-2
01:23:04.528 --> 01:23:08.931
They're running away. The bird
is with them, and it looks like

b06c48db-e4f0-40b4-84ff-95b171e2601f-3
01:23:08.931 --> 01:23:10.049
they're drawing.

6508fcdf-8a83-4482-82c8-7de178c88b5e-0
01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:15.575
Another escape, or maybe
another, or an animal maybe? I'm

6508fcdf-8a83-4482-82c8-7de178c88b5e-1
01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:18.230
not sure what they're drawing,
but.

ca17aaba-6a92-4d40-81e6-b400b8ad0019-0
01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.540
To help them get away on the
island.

e0f25d77-4fce-4d11-bccd-1aeb8556f757-0
01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.150
A rhino, I should have known.

b63835dd-2c64-4615-9be0-76d99867d22e-0
01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.711
It looks like they're going
towards some kind of pyramid or

b63835dd-2c64-4615-9be0-76d99867d22e-1
01:23:31.711 --> 01:23:32.470
buildings.

07775a42-e907-48c1-93b1-7f5a2a99d060-0
01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:39.066
With the rhino, that's their
transportation right now. In the

07775a42-e907-48c1-93b1-7f5a2a99d060-1
01:23:39.066 --> 01:23:43.100
background I see birds and
another monument and in the

07775a42-e907-48c1-93b1-7f5a2a99d060-2
01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:47.720
water, so maybe that's where the
boys are going. It looks like

07775a42-e907-48c1-93b1-7f5a2a99d060-3
01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.920
they have to cross the bridge.

22138655-bec5-4812-86aa-eaae128a5e95-0
01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:54.360
They are crossing a bridge with
the bird.

ace933f4-20d5-4db4-a456-31c89b2e36e7-0
01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.632
And they're getting ready to go
on to the monument, it looks

ace933f4-20d5-4db4-a456-31c89b2e36e7-1
01:23:59.632 --> 01:24:00.830
like, or lighthouse.

3267e238-928a-4a5c-a976-497938bf95c3-0
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.197
Uh, they're on top of the, I'm
going to call it a lighthouse.

3267e238-928a-4a5c-a976-497938bf95c3-1
01:24:07.197 --> 01:24:10.895
And the soldiers are chasing
them. They're drawing something

3267e238-928a-4a5c-a976-497938bf95c3-2
01:24:10.895 --> 01:24:14.350
else, maybe to fly away. I'm
guessing one boy is drawing

3267e238-928a-4a5c-a976-497938bf95c3-3
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:18.047
something in purple, and the
other boys drawing something in

3267e238-928a-4a5c-a976-497938bf95c3-4
01:24:18.047 --> 01:24:18.290
red.

674af2a6-8337-4b12-99c5-ae49837d5dac-0
01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:25.005
Let's see what they're gonna do,
OK? They got away from the

674af2a6-8337-4b12-99c5-ae49837d5dac-1
01:24:25.005 --> 01:24:30.205
soldiers. They they attached the
they drew a swing and the bird

674af2a6-8337-4b12-99c5-ae49837d5dac-2
01:24:30.205 --> 01:24:31.830
is flying them away.

6ef08d1a-e8e0-44f2-acaf-4e3ccbfb0ddc-0
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:33.750
Hopefully to safety.

7b5154ac-9ea3-433a-92b6-0ddfa1c8c5fe-0
01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.009
It looks like they made it to
some kind of monument again.

7b5154ac-9ea3-433a-92b6-0ddfa1c8c5fe-1
01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:43.730
Looks like the soldiers are
still after them.

9bf8b6f8-d1ba-4a20-81e3-c7edfcc1310f-0
01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:48.750
Uh.

5695f859-ed8a-4892-ac8c-34e5b9ff90ff-0
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:57.230
They're on top of the monument
right now. Now they have 123456

5695f859-ed8a-4892-ac8c-34e5b9ff90ff-1
01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:58.250
magic pens.

16452679-0214-42cb-80bf-793b8367acaf-0
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:04.438
They look happy, so they don't
look like they're being. They

16452679-0214-42cb-80bf-793b8367acaf-1
01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:06.970
may not be. They may be out of
trouble right now.

b7b3fcb4-6bcd-4410-8faf-1695f01f56ab-0
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:10.200
Uh, no, they're not.

25794c11-3b66-4690-90ce-6042f54e8746-0
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:14.524
Soldiers are after them. They're
grabbing for the bird. They

25794c11-3b66-4690-90ce-6042f54e8746-1
01:25:14.524 --> 01:25:17.538
still have the bird cage that
the boys look like. They're in

25794c11-3b66-4690-90ce-6042f54e8746-2
01:25:17.538 --> 01:25:19.069
trouble on top of the monument.

4e466859-8d85-460e-9ed7-f82e00b93f7e-0
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:28.340
Don't know if the boys got away
or not, but.

66adbb34-21e7-46eb-8691-80a9d7a3934b-0
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.570
The

1a073fc8-7909-4405-89c8-0f626be475d8-0
01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:35.340
Yeah, looks like the boys are on
top of a monument again.

5286674d-5cc8-49f5-aeb3-10e07e494ba4-0
01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.999
The soldiers look like they
didn't get on, the boys look

5286674d-5cc8-49f5-aeb3-10e07e494ba4-1
01:25:39.999 --> 01:25:42.826
happy, now there is a rainbow A
rainbow that the bird drew in

5286674d-5cc8-49f5-aeb3-10e07e494ba4-2
01:25:42.826 --> 01:25:44.650
there. Looks like they're on
their way.

b503d250-be8e-4690-a998-d14cd6c39d16-0
01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.790
out of trouble, but the soldiers
still have the bird cage.

15dfe0b7-3584-4e43-8092-d880b7900bd9-0
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:53.320
The soldiers look like they're
in trouble.

f8ac2af2-fac1-4aa4-8646-5bdac785732a-0
01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:59.658
There's a rainbow in the
background, and there's the

f8ac2af2-fac1-4aa4-8646-5bdac785732a-1
01:25:59.658 --> 01:25:59.940
king.

208f8f55-0f86-48e6-9be8-4b3350823d27-0
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:07.465
And looks like soldiers are
being tossed off the boat and it

208f8f55-0f86-48e6-9be8-4b3350823d27-1
01:26:07.465 --> 01:26:11.260
looks like the king is going to
be saved by the bird.

1a6c234e-22f3-48a6-94e7-19eb00965548-0
01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:13.980
And and the boys.

a2a275d6-9a61-41ac-a1f3-4dd34b865f6a-0
01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:23.633
They're in a city, the birds
flying above. There's the king

a2a275d6-9a61-41ac-a1f3-4dd34b865f6a-1
01:26:23.633 --> 01:26:26.390
and the boys are on the rhino.

acaf9ae0-fee0-4c9d-954a-489dbd7b8acb-0
01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.039
And it looks like they're safe.
And it looked like they rescued

acaf9ae0-fee0-4c9d-954a-489dbd7b8acb-1
01:26:32.039 --> 01:26:32.540
the king.

a6bf541e-0fe6-4800-bd75-b4788b81e45e-0
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:38.080
And a lot of people.

a54c9435-a9d7-4fb1-a019-cb05a6b46535-0
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:43.770
 Are happy looks like they're
happy that they found them.

2b0b3ce6-a6c0-473a-bb65-dbd1fcaca0a1-0
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.300


b3e68bfa-1906-41e7-9a0e-f6dde2c95a5b-0
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:52.743
Looks like the boys got the king
to safety. There's a waterfall

b3e68bfa-1906-41e7-9a0e-f6dde2c95a5b-1
01:26:52.743 --> 01:26:55.340
and I see the bird in the
background.

20de86ce-1b6b-42b9-a665-02605f0bf1a1-0
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:01.690
The king is with the the boys
are smiling and the king is

20de86ce-1b6b-42b9-a665-02605f0bf1a1-1
01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:05.191
drawing something. He just
crowned the one of the boys for

20de86ce-1b6b-42b9-a665-02605f0bf1a1-2
01:27:05.191 --> 01:27:08.810
saving him, and it looks like
he's thanking them and they're

20de86ce-1b6b-42b9-a665-02605f0bf1a1-3
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:09.700
waving goodbye.

4ec4852f-7820-4e5a-beeb-7b5aec735bd6-0
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:16.304
And the boys are back in the
city with the rainbow. They look

4ec4852f-7820-4e5a-beeb-7b5aec735bd6-1
01:27:16.304 --> 01:27:19.850
like they both have crowns that
were given to them by the king.

90558503-7c0a-41e7-9240-0d8c19742040-0
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.960
As a gift. #END_quest

End of the story and the end of
this study, OK.
