61934c3b-77ce-4b0f-ab5f-2ebcfa02e25a-0
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.948
All right, so today we're
starting out with a complex

61934c3b-77ce-4b0f-ab5f-2ebcfa02e25a-1
00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:08.490
scene. I'm going to share my
screen.

5370a0ae-955f-406f-9041-944b7a76d0f0-0
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.120
All right.

69e24ab3-e6a9-4db4-844c-6aa7aae7abdb-0
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.080
Um, so you could begin when
you're ready? OK, we're looking

69e24ab3-e6a9-4db4-844c-6aa7aae7abdb-1
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.980
at a thing called escape from
the zoo.

309a2dce-ffae-4e08-982d-49bcad02327b-0
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.638
#START_escape_from_the_zoo So
the picture the scene is taking

309a2dce-ffae-4e08-982d-49bcad02327b-1
00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:36.430
place in a zoo and it's filled
with.

b0c520af-ecbd-486b-bf6d-4560e64c1d5d-0
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.697
Many people and many types of
animals. Different parts of the

b0c520af-ecbd-486b-bf6d-4560e64c1d5d-1
00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:47.072
zoo. It looks like a pretty
crazy zoo. Some of the animals

b0c520af-ecbd-486b-bf6d-4560e64c1d5d-2
00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:50.410
are running free, the pot or the
rhinoceros.

96e962ab-41d5-42ef-9e0f-69f5e9399b64-0
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.410
And is running down.

00b07ea6-7b61-468d-baae-448f52fd824f-0
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.935
The sidewalk with all the people
running in front of it, trying

00b07ea6-7b61-468d-baae-448f52fd824f-1
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:06.610
to escape from it, including a
snake. It's very colorful. There

00b07ea6-7b61-468d-baae-448f52fd824f-2
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.310
are there's an umbrella, a man
with a hot dog stand.

547a3740-f8fb-4bb2-8752-bdbecb7a5ccf-0
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.760
On one of the pathways and
serving a hot dog to a person

547a3740-f8fb-4bb2-8752-bdbecb7a5ccf-1
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.500
with a blue hat and black
backpack.

3a3ea3d9-cb49-4c57-b975-149acf915eb7-0
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.517
There's a pen that has the
zebras in it and then the

3a3ea3d9-cb49-4c57-b975-149acf915eb7-1
00:01:27.517 --> 00:01:32.707
zebras' cage. It's not really a
cage. It's kind of an open area

3a3ea3d9-cb49-4c57-b975-149acf915eb7-2
00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:37.572
that's surrounded by a clear
fence. That's the glass fence.

3a3ea3d9-cb49-4c57-b975-149acf915eb7-3
00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:42.113
And in that area there's a
hippopotamus. There are some

3a3ea3d9-cb49-4c57-b975-149acf915eb7-4
00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:44.869
flamingos, there are some
zebras.

3c00f96b-ca3b-4e97-b934-91cb63ac190e-0
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.382
And across the walkway in
another enclosure, there's the

3c00f96b-ca3b-4e97-b934-91cb63ac190e-1
00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:56.010
Lions' enclosure and.

e3a1ba44-2e1d-4032-9f95-8b5c4053aa46-0
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.057
The lion and the lioness are
sitting up on a rock, and

e3a1ba44-2e1d-4032-9f95-8b5c4053aa46-1
00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:02.090
they're both.

0b185735-e073-4924-9e2f-81287a682ca7-0
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.793
Licking their chops because some
some of the people have fallen

0b185735-e073-4924-9e2f-81287a682ca7-1
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.777
into their enclosure, so I guess
they're trying to decide if they

0b185735-e073-4924-9e2f-81287a682ca7-2
00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:11.200
should.

c7fa0ae3-5d1f-40b8-aef8-2787db824997-0
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.690
eat them.

0059814e-6066-4751-a436-dc4213a01054-0
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.623
In the middle of the picture
there is a enclosure that looks

0059814e-6066-4751-a436-dc4213a01054-1
00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:21.850
like an ice structure.

8ceae999-92bd-4618-87f8-d6e650885d95-0
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.580
I don't see anything in there.

87b24b02-bf2c-490d-b888-698ba80aced6-0
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.080
Umm.

d153317e-365e-4dc4-b06b-28fbfaf81a4c-0
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.560
So that may.

558f46f8-a604-4fd7-b5a7-94766dff1216-0
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.269
No, no, the hippopotamus or the
rhinoceros wouldn't have escaped

558f46f8-a604-4fd7-b5a7-94766dff1216-1
00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.380
from there anyway.

53f8699e-466c-45b9-a50a-e583050266cc-0
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.400
There was something in there I
can't see. Maybe Penguins, but.

c19d7b4b-069c-44e3-a363-88847af0f2ab-0
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.508
Further in the back there is an
area that's colder. It's got the

c19d7b4b-069c-44e3-a363-88847af0f2ab-1
00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:50.861
polar bears, the polar bear
enclosure, so. And then far to

c19d7b4b-069c-44e3-a363-88847af0f2ab-2
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:56.397
the right of the picture is the
cafe and the gift shop where

c19d7b4b-069c-44e3-a363-88847af0f2ab-3
00:02:56.397 --> 00:03:01.478
people can shop and eat. And
sitting on top of the cafe

c19d7b4b-069c-44e3-a363-88847af0f2ab-4
00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:06.560
there's an eagle and a parrot
and another kind of bird.

cf4bc8c0-b973-44ba-a638-303b725cb758-0
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.689
And if you look to the right of
the cafe and the shop, there's

cf4bc8c0-b973-44ba-a638-303b725cb758-1
00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.089
another enclosure that has the
great apes and there are 123456

cf4bc8c0-b973-44ba-a638-303b725cb758-2
00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:22.974
of them sitting out on a mound
with grass and rock, just

cf4bc8c0-b973-44ba-a638-303b725cb758-3
00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:28.459
looking at the people, and the
people are looking back at them.

0d0447f1-d983-40fd-8c06-9dda14c4f391-0
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.444
And finally, across from the
Lions and next to the Apes is an

0d0447f1-d983-40fd-8c06-9dda14c4f391-1
00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.720
enclosure that has the.

01246723-94f2-40e4-a4c5-59bf8ee4b304-0
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.550
Has the African animals the the
ze, no, the giraffe.

3574b5a4-9245-486e-8ab3-1eccb49793d3-0
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.860
Uh, the antelope and the
aardvark.

005c1d1c-7d31-43b8-8b52-a867e3e97032-0
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.169
two of the animals that are out
on the Savannah and there's a

005c1d1c-7d31-43b8-8b52-a867e3e97032-1
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:55.630
little.

c3c8f294-a3f0-4a0c-a774-b602ff68f8c1-0
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.101
Penguin in an airplane that's
flying past the enclosure, which

c3c8f294-a3f0-4a0c-a774-b602ff68f8c1-1
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:03.340
may have been what was in the.

e9560169-524d-427e-829d-e212f6b914e6-0
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.880
Umm.

099301e3-59b3-4cc5-89f5-d9814c65c7c5-0
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.050
The ice structure. Maybe the
Penguin escaped.

355abea7-c066-4e96-b282-e26addd49bfd-0
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.510
And finally, there is a tree
that overlooks the whole scene

355abea7-c066-4e96-b282-e26addd49bfd-1
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.984
that has some lemurs in it, and
they're sitting there looking at

355abea7-c066-4e96-b282-e26addd49bfd-2
00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:23.390
the people. So it's a beautiful
scene filled with lots of color

355abea7-c066-4e96-b282-e26addd49bfd-3
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.349
and lots of people looking at
the animals.

f8ad8317-3de1-4417-8ce0-19b9481fdda7-0
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.950
Walking.

fc5dd265-a8bf-422a-bc9c-8540ff2dc866-0
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.720
Through the exhibits.

e0bcacc2-8e05-42d7-8a20-2510cbfd81c2-0
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.298
And some animals with them.
There's a kangaroo amongst them.

e0bcacc2-8e05-42d7-8a20-2510cbfd81c2-1
00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:42.970
Away in the back I see that
there are some elephants as

e0bcacc2-8e05-42d7-8a20-2510cbfd81c2-2
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.975
well, and the rhinoceros, so I
guess that's where the rhino

e0bcacc2-8e05-42d7-8a20-2510cbfd81c2-3
00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.060
escaped from.

959fefcf-2aeb-4ceb-b7a6-23f7a5eb575f-0
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.710
The elephant cage.

ca6a6dc4-661d-4f4e-81f6-c6eff90eeda5-0
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.230
And all of this.

7184901f-1d5d-4622-9024-299b0f772a84-0
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.965
Right outside of the city, you
can see the city skyline way in

7184901f-1d5d-4622-9024-299b0f772a84-1
00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.258
the back of the scene. That's
the end.

7184901f-1d5d-4622-9024-299b0f772a84-2
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:03.670
#END_escape_from_the_zoo

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.420
OK, let me.

0140bfab-52ae-46c0-95e2-6dd6bcbf587e-0
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.620
Trying to be a little shorter.

36c9c849-ee80-40d1-a9b5-bdce8bd5db09-0
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.920

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.530
OK, Next is a story.

08f80437-d17a-4339-95a1-c82d53af9ceb-0
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.187
OK, so this one's a short story.
So describe the page and then

08f80437-d17a-4339-95a1-c82d53af9ceb-1
00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:47.650
ask me when to move on to the
next one. OK?

5b5b50df-2d21-4713-ae4a-6db5d1bb8bb6-0
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.339
#START_quest So this is, this is
this is the story for Darcy. It

5b5b50df-2d21-4713-ae4a-6db5d1bb8bb6-1
00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.350
says that on the first page and
on this page we see.

d19d4f1d-5f68-4f47-b981-d659bcd1c41a-0
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.910
A, a statute. It may be, I
wonder, it may be a statue of

d19d4f1d-5f68-4f47-b981-d659bcd1c41a-1
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:04.500
Darcy.

d54c4d1a-e39d-4bc7-add1-dc1f22383407-0
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.570
In a costume, a young Roman.

4ae45c39-da80-4cb8-8acc-d12a3d735eec-0
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.630
Child, young girl with wings on
her back and say.

c91e0525-2b0b-48dc-bfba-775a6de45887-0
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.895
vest made it looks like may have
been made of chain meal with

c91e0525-2b0b-48dc-bfba-775a6de45887-1
00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:25.630
sandals and a a skirt and.

3ee7216e-5ccf-43a1-add8-9e7e8b083081-0
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.840
I can't tell if she's holding a
sword in her hand.

b299da9f-3b5c-4b47-991a-8d43763d2137-0
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.820
Anyway, she's it's a statue of
Stone statue of her standing on

b299da9f-3b5c-4b47-991a-8d43763d2137-1
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.379
a wall, and and beside this wall
is a garbage can and a park

b299da9f-3b5c-4b47-991a-8d43763d2137-2
00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.300
bench and a lamp post. So it
looks to be that it's an

b299da9f-3b5c-4b47-991a-8d43763d2137-3
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.314
entrance to the park, and as you
look to the next page you'll see

b299da9f-3b5c-4b47-991a-8d43763d2137-4
00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:54.770
that.

b4f9cd96-0ff7-4e39-ada4-01d2328cb8a3-0
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.950
Behind the statue there is a
stone bridge.

b8218e9e-5e9e-44d1-9128-217a535904c8-0
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:06.491
So we are definitely in a park
and the walkway leads under the

b8218e9e-5e9e-44d1-9128-217a535904c8-1
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:12.411
bridge where there is a a wooden
door and two children are

b8218e9e-5e9e-44d1-9128-217a535904c8-2
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.820
standing underneath the.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.345
The bridge trying to get away
from the rain. They have ridden

dc5bb154-68bf-44a5-af62-46b82d7f1ff5-1
00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:26.580
their bike which is a tandem
that's parked outside the.

03f101da-44ea-4faa-94f9-3f9750daa324-0
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.253
Underpass sitting out in the
rain. It's a little bit

03f101da-44ea-4faa-94f9-3f9750daa324-1
00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:34.420
confusing scene because.

af325294-795c-4643-82e8-778da3a2c070-0
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.507
The one child is holding his
hands out to see if to feel the

af325294-795c-4643-82e8-778da3a2c070-1
00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:43.355
rain, but the other child is
looking suspiciously at the

af325294-795c-4643-82e8-778da3a2c070-2
00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:47.338
doors that are underneath the
bridge that they're standing

af325294-795c-4643-82e8-778da3a2c070-3
00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:51.254
beside. And above them is a
street lamp, but, well, not a

af325294-795c-4643-82e8-778da3a2c070-4
00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:55.507
street lamp, but a lamp that's
coming out of the bottom of the

af325294-795c-4643-82e8-778da3a2c070-5
00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:59.220
bridge and it's shining its
light on the two children.

0be8173d-eaa2-4711-ad0f-995e82772596-0
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.660

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.194
Or your Angel is a mermaid that
you can only see the bottom part

16715911-3060-43eb-8775-79b0e3421d4e-1
00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:13.810
of her.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.430
Her fin, but you can see her
hands and long hair.

bae6a23d-e45a-4673-b7d1-5d9988b55266-0
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.380
So at each abutment of the of
the.

756cf206-f689-4059-8a63-038bf3afe07f-0
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.818
Bridge there's a different
statue. On the other side.

756cf206-f689-4059-8a63-038bf3afe07f-1
00:08:28.818 --> 00:08:33.818
There's a Indian Buddha looking
statue and it the road leads on

756cf206-f689-4059-8a63-038bf3afe07f-2
00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:38.348
into the park and there's
another park bench on the other

756cf206-f689-4059-8a63-038bf3afe07f-3
00:08:38.348 --> 00:08:41.630
side of the of the Thruway into
the park.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.398
So as the children are standing
there, the next page shows that

c3de8aef-8285-4cfe-8229-cfb6424223f0-1
00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:55.959
the doors have opened and a
wizard looking King comes out.

c3de8aef-8285-4cfe-8229-cfb6424223f0-2
00:08:55.959 --> 00:09:00.598
He startles them, they both
fallen back and one, the little

c3de8aef-8285-4cfe-8229-cfb6424223f0-3
00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:05.237
girl's laying on the ground
leaning up on her elbow and the

c3de8aef-8285-4cfe-8229-cfb6424223f0-4
00:09:05.237 --> 00:09:09.180
boy is leaning against the wall
and the wizard is.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.612
Showing though a piece of paper
that has something that looks

a7ba3634-4419-4c73-a302-6d3237bb3b0f-1
00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:16.290
like a crown on it with.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.550
Creature that is flown out of

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.425
It's purple and it has a long
tail and wings and it's flying

6bdca8a3-4f05-44de-a254-e899937f90d3-1
00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:36.660
above the children.

On the the wall surrounding the
door.

Looks also like a picture of
the.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.010
The person, the king, who's come
out of the door.

d486ece6-ce04-48c6-bf06-8dfbb151e25f-0
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.640
And there's also the frame of
the door has a picture of.

51075c35-743b-4216-bb6c-f9f82ea0f8c7-0
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.498
What looks like to be a squid
and his tentacles form the shape

51075c35-743b-4216-bb6c-f9f82ea0f8c7-1
00:10:06.498 --> 00:10:07.290

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.080
The next page shows three scenes
where the Wizard King.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.640
His sash around the little girl.

753ddb48-d827-4c1f-a41d-b1039abfbb13-0
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.040
And gives the boy a piece of
paper and something in his hand.

1d148da7-ebc9-4f45-a698-d664cb541f3b-0
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.331
Something that they were holding
like a scroll and the little

1d148da7-ebc9-4f45-a698-d664cb541f3b-1
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:40.495
bird. The Purple bird is on the
boy's shoulder and the king is

1d148da7-ebc9-4f45-a698-d664cb541f3b-2
00:10:40.495 --> 00:10:45.249
pointing them to go. And as he
points to them to go, some

1d148da7-ebc9-4f45-a698-d664cb541f3b-3
00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:50.085
soldiers, Roman soldiers with
Spears, come out of the door

1d148da7-ebc9-4f45-a698-d664cb541f3b-4
00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:54.921
behind the king and the purple
bird flies away and and the

1d148da7-ebc9-4f45-a698-d664cb541f3b-5
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.380
soldiers grabbed the king and.

4466e8be-feb3-4c9a-818b-9a41023a396b-0
00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.900
The.

efa96e09-4c9f-4836-8413-fc56914e31c1-0
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.674
Children are startled and
staring at what's happening. And

efa96e09-4c9f-4836-8413-fc56914e31c1-1
00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:08.829
then the third scene on that
page, the soldiers are forcing

efa96e09-4c9f-4836-8413-fc56914e31c1-2
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:13.052
the king with the long white
beard and the crown on his head

efa96e09-4c9f-4836-8413-fc56914e31c1-3
00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:17.206
to go back into the door to the
doorway that he came out of

efa96e09-4c9f-4836-8413-fc56914e31c1-4
00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:18.730
underneath the bridge.

1d4ec22a-77f0-446d-a8a5-de671910265d-0
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.687
And leave the children there
with the scrolls, and the paper

1d4ec22a-77f0-446d-a8a5-de671910265d-1
00:11:24.687 --> 00:11:28.600
with the crown on it, and the
purple creature.

aa0da4c6-9070-4395-8e7b-a383e9d31a52-0
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.120
Turn the page.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.041
So it's still raining the the
the next page shows that it's

593970a0-1803-4c41-b677-2c19320dfd9e-1
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:45.431
still raining outside and the
children are still under the

593970a0-1803-4c41-b677-2c19320dfd9e-2
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:50.730
bridge and they're standing
around the door where the the

593970a0-1803-4c41-b677-2c19320dfd9e-3
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.010
king was just.

04ece66b-89f8-4b9d-995c-d3f3df9f3880-0
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.050
Captured and taken back inside.

87322859-c2b6-440c-adad-ad78d4bf7b70-0
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.160
And they're trying to decide
what to do. They they have.

ffbbf3c3-351a-44dc-b7c5-162fe90ab02a-0
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:05.060
3-4 Scrolls, one is Red, one is
orange, one is purple.

ba90d35f-30b6-489a-a7e8-a1446618287f-0
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.182
And the one that the larger
scroll that the king gave to

ba90d35f-30b6-489a-a7e8-a1446618287f-1
00:12:09.182 --> 00:12:12.721
them. So a white piece of paper.
And the little boy is standing

ba90d35f-30b6-489a-a7e8-a1446618287f-2
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:16.039
there looking at the purple
scroll that he has in his hand.

f925e19e-823b-4156-8fa5-11a22bb28fb7-0
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.630
In his left hand. In his right
hand he has a the white larger

f925e19e-823b-4156-8fa5-11a22bb28fb7-1
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.749
scroll that has the crown.
Picture the crown in it, and

f925e19e-823b-4156-8fa5-11a22bb28fb7-2
00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:29.942
still sitting on the little
boy's shoulder is the purple

f925e19e-823b-4156-8fa5-11a22bb28fb7-3
00:12:29.942 --> 00:12:32.589
bird with a long tail and
feathers.

2a0648a7-cf0d-4b99-b10d-4f31d16f77e9-0
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.081
They're talking to each other
and deciding what to do and on

2a0648a7-cf0d-4b99-b10d-4f31d16f77e9-1
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:40.960
the next page it's shows three
more scenes.

7b04ed8a-a26b-4a84-9209-aea0927c0b46-0
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.228
Where the the bird is flying in
the air. Although he's not

7b04ed8a-a26b-4a84-9209-aea0927c0b46-1
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:54.974
leaving, he's staying around
this. The children are still

7b04ed8a-a26b-4a84-9209-aea0927c0b46-2
00:12:54.974 --> 00:13:00.293
outside the door and inside the
scrolls they discover that there

7b04ed8a-a26b-4a84-9209-aea0927c0b46-3
00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:01.029
are keys.

7e3e3200-0774-4335-8ed6-6af8e2b39cb8-0
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:07.392
And they unfold the scrolls and
find that both of them, the red

7e3e3200-0774-4335-8ed6-6af8e2b39cb8-1
00:13:07.392 --> 00:13:12.637
and the purple scrolls, have
keys in them. And in the second

7e3e3200-0774-4335-8ed6-6af8e2b39cb8-2
00:13:12.637 --> 00:13:17.710
scene the the Purple Bird has
landed on the ground and the

7e3e3200-0774-4335-8ed6-6af8e2b39cb8-3
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:23.041
children are comparing their
keys to each other's. And in the

7e3e3200-0774-4335-8ed6-6af8e2b39cb8-4
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:27.340
third scene they've put the keys
in the door and.

9fc5e077-5f29-48c7-8e9c-6566c9b4ec5c-0
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:35.714
The keys opened the doors, and
they run into the doorway, which

9fc5e077-5f29-48c7-8e9c-6566c9b4ec5c-1
00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:42.139
the soldiers and the the
soldiers had taken the old king

9fc5e077-5f29-48c7-8e9c-6566c9b4ec5c-2
00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:42.590
and.

ddcb087d-77ae-4a32-ab0f-8dfd6305cc25-0
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.856
Taking him back into inside the
doorway into the hall and the

ddcb087d-77ae-4a32-ab0f-8dfd6305cc25-1
00:13:48.856 --> 00:13:52.770
purple bird follows them into
the door. Next page.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.290
So this page is.

6066b865-4397-42e0-a8d7-184f5646999d-0
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.840
Shows where the children ended
up as they ran through the door.

d8e5155a-7130-45b8-9844-9ee6d276ec63-0
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.490

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:22.020
And a an underground passage
that comes out into a city.

7c21e45a-bf72-4e52-9a5e-93adc7b65746-0
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.736
And it comes out into a small
body of water where there's a

7c21e45a-bf72-4e52-9a5e-93adc7b65746-1
00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:32.760
water fountain and a rock.

5cc6d5e1-a5a2-4d9f-b55b-072b8a4d3194-0
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.160
And um flying in the air are
some.

9b9a9fde-68f1-4454-b683-dcc945cca01e-0
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.170
Dirigible looking.

3c7a05eb-c50b-4aa3-b7db-3d345390697f-0
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:47.324
Vessels that are there are three
of them floating in the air that

3c7a05eb-c50b-4aa3-b7db-3d345390697f-1
00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:52.235
have propellers and each of them
contains people in them and

3c7a05eb-c50b-4aa3-b7db-3d345390697f-2
00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:57.147
they're probably air taxis or
something. But getting back to

3c7a05eb-c50b-4aa3-b7db-3d345390697f-3
00:14:57.147 --> 00:15:01.978
the children, they are hiding
behind a rock that is sitting

3c7a05eb-c50b-4aa3-b7db-3d345390697f-4
00:15:01.978 --> 00:15:06.889
next to The Cave entrance that
they came out of, and they're

3c7a05eb-c50b-4aa3-b7db-3d345390697f-5
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:11.640
looking across the water onto
the next page where you see.

520e0a88-5bce-4f22-8076-72031e44473d-0
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.120
The walls of the city and.

f400dde4-e45f-47d8-bede-5ec63ae0c38d-0
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.330


b06d3b3c-6135-4858-ac99-ae32e4f2db2f-0
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.944
A steamer boat or a wheel boat
that has crossed the river and

b06d3b3c-6135-4858-ac99-ae32e4f2db2f-1
00:15:24.944 --> 00:15:27.850
has the soldiers and the king.

af6d472a-d75d-417b-b753-0fb43dab9d32-0
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.628
On it, and the soldiers are
holding their Spears to the

af6d472a-d75d-417b-b753-0fb43dab9d32-1
00:15:33.628 --> 00:15:38.588
king, so he must have escaped to
give the children clues, and the

af6d472a-d75d-417b-b753-0fb43dab9d32-2
00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:43.248
soldiers have captured him and
are now taking him back across

af6d472a-d75d-417b-b753-0fb43dab9d32-3
00:15:43.248 --> 00:15:44.000
the water.

3e2d7a5f-6bc4-4336-9c02-84a2fd536345-0
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.882
Have taken him through The Cave,
across the water and back to

3e2d7a5f-6bc4-4336-9c02-84a2fd536345-1
00:15:48.882 --> 00:15:49.320
prison.

a222494f-7aa1-4c38-a361-b7c1b1763be3-0
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.725
The the the water leads into a
river that enters under a bridge

a222494f-7aa1-4c38-a361-b7c1b1763be3-1
00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:59.450
into the what looks like it goes
into the city.

2d6609a5-b823-4a4c-b33c-6303c755e945-0
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:07.421
And above the the wheeled ship,
the steamship is a bridge where

2d6609a5-b823-4a4c-b33c-6303c755e945-1
00:16:07.421 --> 00:16:08.420
there are.

fe0494f5-c3f0-425b-a536-4368eb46a9e3-0
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.160
Soldiers watching over the city.

a7633f95-a9fa-4a7d-89c6-5deeb864e1c8-0
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.390
Umm.

4a7e8278-53ed-4b2a-8d2d-befcf4cc3958-0
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.220
And.

de1ff32b-10be-42fa-bd7c-200aba00e2bf-0
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.035
There are things burning in the
city. There's a lot of smoke

de1ff32b-10be-42fa-bd7c-200aba00e2bf-1
00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:24.860
there. I'm not sure what that
means yet, but we'll find out.

fd85913c-41dd-4567-b5fb-ab299490fc3e-0
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.482
So the next page picture shows
the children still hiding behind

fd85913c-41dd-4567-b5fb-ab299490fc3e-1
00:16:36.482 --> 00:16:40.430
the rock, trying to figure out
what to do next.

e79315cc-fd6c-4b6e-b7ac-6b1d54e72fe4-0
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:48.490
And looking towards the archway
that the boat floated towards

e79315cc-fd6c-4b6e-b7ac-6b1d54e72fe4-1
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.820
and through.

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-0
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.953
Looked like it was heading into
the city. The children are

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-1
00:16:55.953 --> 00:17:00.619
looking at the paper that the
king gave to them that had the

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-2
00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:05.438
circles on it and the connecting
lines, and they're staring at

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-3
00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:09.874
it, trying to figure out what it
is. Standing next to the

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-4
00:17:09.874 --> 00:17:14.540
children across like a little
in, out, XX, is the red is the

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-5
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.053
purple bird looking into the
water, and in the distance is

c7f08989-559c-4d48-9212-373d8a643214-6
00:17:19.053 --> 00:17:22.190
the boat with the king and the
soldiers.

44cbe291-c2b1-4baa-989f-c1daa46f846f-0
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.790
Sailing under the archway.

b079c0a1-3edc-4a4e-b342-477b67c9e6ff-0
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.470
Of the bridge where

0957a8bc-8fe2-4933-b367-69108f4c28f0-0
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.625
The soldiers are standing,
watching the boat pass

0957a8bc-8fe2-4933-b367-69108f4c28f0-1
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:36.500
underneath.

332584b6-3b35-4b13-9765-edb550efabb8-0
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:44.687
The city itself is a great wall
city with tiled roofs and golden

332584b6-3b35-4b13-9765-edb550efabb8-1
00:17:44.687 --> 00:17:49.700
domed roofs and several fires
burning in the city.

88d8ebf0-0d23-4ec2-907d-15317fe8c569-0
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.301
The boat itself, with the king
on it, looks to be headed out to

88d8ebf0-0d23-4ec2-907d-15317fe8c569-1
00:17:55.301 --> 00:17:57.650
sea now instead of into the
city.

8c53650b-a7e1-43ce-8fdd-2da4b35d9aac-0
00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.970
Heading towards.

cec467b7-000a-455e-8b12-a3ac77aa5bb4-0
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.240


cb1020a7-09d8-4a40-9995-d2288e80b23d-0
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.570
An area that has lots of clouds
and smoke.

0a3a31b5-bb28-44c8-badd-2be2a2462bf7-0
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.350
On the next page, it's a

b5913f2d-4889-4180-a455-e3924f584ba2-0
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.276
Detailed close up of the paper
that the king gave to the

b5913f2d-4889-4180-a455-e3924f584ba2-1
00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:17.192
children and it shows 6 circles.
Multicolored circles, one circle

b5913f2d-4889-4180-a455-e3924f584ba2-2
00:18:17.192 --> 00:18:20.917
of yellow that has it's
underwater with some fish

b5913f2d-4889-4180-a455-e3924f584ba2-3
00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:24.269
swimming around it. Looks like
the pantheon.

83686a8a-e2dc-4286-be30-cde11471d41a-0
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.610
A green circle that has.

06a4c29d-f3e8-4af7-9593-d30405bc3935-0
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.840
Another building on it, a blue
circle that has a.

9c234cd6-ae68-43a6-b04a-42724594cae6-0
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:39.161
Mountain inside it, a purple
circle that has a palm tree in

9c234cd6-ae68-43a6-b04a-42724594cae6-1
00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:45.284
it, a red circle that has trees,
a forest with a door and a tree

9c234cd6-ae68-43a6-b04a-42724594cae6-2
00:18:45.284 --> 00:18:45.850
in it.

8badb689-b8a5-41b1-8293-994f408d515c-0
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.600
And the gold circle that shows
where they are currently.

4fa50ef5-46de-4824-8229-15658ac0bec8-0
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:53.950
at the city.

b27b2efc-661d-4503-92ad-d2ce2ada328a-0
00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:00.180
And these circles are
superimposed on a map.

03531f7c-9418-4d59-a833-e4a61ed2ebdb-0
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:01.810
Of.

2987bbb1-857f-4129-8bc3-71a18bfb5ef8-0
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.660
Of the country.

2cc0fd7b-0c8b-4a1f-abe9-3442c82be897-0
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.070
And the little boy, the little
girl's finger.

9a670f50-8de6-4266-8d71-207275e6dce5-0
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.943
Is pointing to the yellow circle
that looks under the sea with

9a670f50-8de6-4266-8d71-207275e6dce5-1
00:19:13.943 --> 00:19:17.990
the fish swimming, and each of
these circles is.

36d159ca-9982-4aeb-8001-41b7cdfc5fc9-0
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.300
Connected by colorful lines.

fd22e5a5-d5ba-4998-b6d8-938f8a748539-0
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.560
Some of them have full rainbow
between.

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-0
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.065
Blue and the purple between the
purple and the red, there's a

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-1
00:19:32.065 --> 00:19:36.582
purple line. Between the red and
the gold, there's a red and a

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-2
00:19:36.582 --> 00:19:40.598
purple line. Between the gold
and the yellow. There's a

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-3
00:19:40.598 --> 00:19:44.757
purple, gold and red line.
Between the yellow there's the

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-4
00:19:44.757 --> 00:19:48.915
purple, yellow, gold and red
line between the red and the

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-5
00:19:48.915 --> 00:19:53.074
green and the blue with the
purple, green, yellow, orange

324696aa-951d-48f6-b993-4996f749a303-6
00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:57.090
and red line, and then between
the blue and the purple.

c3a03bc6-4efc-4158-bbc6-a814483889db-0
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.717
Circles. They've come full
circle and the every color is

c3a03bc6-4efc-4158-bbc6-a814483889db-1
00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:04.980
represented as a rainbow.

b96c77de-f411-443b-969c-6c59b1fdd6f8-0
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.540
So that must be the end of.

5b76ff8a-36fc-4cfd-bc0c-da006193fd4b-0
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.011
When they finally get to where
they're going, they'll be at the

5b76ff8a-36fc-4cfd-bc0c-da006193fd4b-1
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:13.560
palm tree.

616fbfe4-aaa2-4e30-af27-29f54619c60f-0
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.000
Turn the page.

50f019e1-1eea-4433-912f-319d18237769-0
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.860
So the next page shows the
children still.

f988e791-c552-4b95-b08a-4e6987e436ec-0
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.460
Sitting at the rock beside the
water.

bfec6d4d-1ae8-46ff-bd01-f06a595d744b-0
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.570
The pointed rock.

fd5dbcc5-2370-4247-ae09-1d320690ed63-0
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.189
And they're hiding behind it.
It's big enough that they can

fd5dbcc5-2370-4247-ae09-1d320690ed63-1
00:20:35.189 --> 00:20:39.285
hide there and not be seen. The
little boy is crouched down,

fd5dbcc5-2370-4247-ae09-1d320690ed63-2
00:20:39.285 --> 00:20:42.979
holding the picture of the
circles, and the map on the

fd5dbcc5-2370-4247-ae09-1d320690ed63-3
00:20:42.979 --> 00:20:45.800
little girl is standing next to
the rock.

cc7060eb-f3d0-492d-b487-652badf3664b-0
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.580
Hiding and looking, and the
waterfall is behind them.

79418499-6590-4ba5-a6c8-fb279ad3c480-0
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:57.429
And coming towards them on the
water are the boats and these

79418499-6590-4ba5-a6c8-fb279ad3c480-1
00:20:57.429 --> 00:20:58.940
soldiers who were.

ce494090-f7ff-4e36-8bbe-c81f3edb5c2c-0
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.997
Formerly upon the bridge,
looking down into the water and

ce494090-f7ff-4e36-8bbe-c81f3edb5c2c-1
00:21:03.997 --> 00:21:08.865
watching the Boat go by. They're
coming towards them in canoes or

ce494090-f7ff-4e36-8bbe-c81f3edb5c2c-2
00:21:08.865 --> 00:21:13.290
the types of boats you would see

00:28:11.258 --> 00:28:15.862
flying in, through the sky, and
they're making their way up a

5ea28fed-6dd3-4c74-a8db-7918f27074ef-3
00:28:15.862 --> 00:28:19.130
slight slope into the forest of
palm trees.

bf9658fc-6182-4419-9225-49ba32f81809-0
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.931
And the next page is a blank
page with just the girl and the

bf9658fc-6182-4419-9225-49ba32f81809-1
00:28:25.931 --> 00:28:29.190
boy and the scrolls have turned
into.

4cf3bcac-cf7e-4d97-98ed-a03d2baa0c6e-0
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.213
Crayons and the little girl
holds a red crayon or marker and

4cf3bcac-cf7e-4d97-98ed-a03d2baa0c6e-1
00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:39.440
the little boy holds a purple
one and they are drawing.

aafae1e3-4e66-4635-83b4-ae4b70b9c4f8-0
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.310
Something on the page.

863bb9fd-5beb-44ab-8318-fe1d7cb6d616-0
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.400
And it looks like it's maybe an.

c2aec73b-6b48-4c72-b312-41153f2d2531-0
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.450
It's a purple hump.

8ced2d80-af64-4367-a7da-8929d06192bc-0
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.810
With a Red Square, it looks like
they may be drawing an elephant.

52a65f71-2446-4d98-8459-d7d10ce2a224-0
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.840
Or some kind of animal that they
can ride on.

9c6ec053-9d6d-4db5-b221-2b870ed9756f-0
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.172
It's hard to say yet, and
sitting on the boy's shoulder is

9c6ec053-9d6d-4db5-b221-2b870ed9756f-1
00:29:02.172 --> 00:29:03.160
the purple bird.

0343a010-b3f1-43c1-bd76-a46614a60f82-0
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.040
Umm.

4a1864b6-6b0a-460c-9d28-4c982f58638c-0
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.330
Next page.

d71487d2-a1b8-4cc1-803e-4f9b6e1ecfd2-0
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.330
Yes, so this page shows that.

0280a269-f44b-488e-b503-3bb1bc2c25a0-0
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.275
They decided to use their magic
scroll, which turned into a pen.

0280a269-f44b-488e-b503-3bb1bc2c25a0-1
00:29:22.275 --> 00:29:26.490
It turned into crayons and
markers to draw a.

130b2a66-5277-4560-a40d-b4698cd53d20-0
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.250
Purple.

ff2f4982-a7dd-4f4e-b819-945f83e464a7-0
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:35.740
Rhinoceros with, on top of is a.

6d1978de-e58b-4d49-b4c2-4f108aba863a-0
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.024
A canopied saddle where both the
boy and the girl are sitting

6d1978de-e58b-4d49-b4c2-4f108aba863a-1
00:29:41.024 --> 00:29:45.728
under the canopy. It's a very
tropical place and this picture

6d1978de-e58b-4d49-b4c2-4f108aba863a-2
00:29:45.728 --> 00:29:50.736
shows them riding the rhinoceros
along a dirt path that has taken

6d1978de-e58b-4d49-b4c2-4f108aba863a-3
00:29:50.736 --> 00:29:52.330
them into the jungle.

3b1b3e9a-807a-4861-abfe-3486e17fba67-0
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.250
And.

b8e8313b-ff90-411b-92fa-c2006bf83c82-0
00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.527
The bird is flying overhead with
them, and as they make their way

b8e8313b-ff90-411b-92fa-c2006bf83c82-1
00:30:00.527 --> 00:30:05.600
down the path they come to two
large statues of of men with.

4a46519d-e76d-49b2-9a7e-393507a416b5-0
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.500
Feathers on their back.

214e1c67-0c18-4fc5-b78f-7bf47a059c0f-0
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:14.273
And they're they're walking
towards these statues on either

214e1c67-0c18-4fc5-b78f-7bf47a059c0f-1
00:30:14.273 --> 00:30:16.100
side of the dirt road and.

44e6ee80-f020-4d2e-88c6-99b93a11756e-0
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.270
The dirt Road leads to.

5571c8ba-5d72-4937-af61-fb2bb4d23efe-0
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:25.415
The ancient civil ancient Incan
or Mayan civilization where they

5571c8ba-5d72-4937-af61-fb2bb4d23efe-1
00:30:25.415 --> 00:30:26.210
had these.

ffeba8ac-9bdb-4040-82e2-320a373c0424-0
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.778
Large pyramid type things with
steps going up and they would

ffeba8ac-9bdb-4040-82e2-320a373c0424-1
00:30:31.778 --> 00:30:36.603
have human sacrifices there. And
anyway the rhinoceros with the

ffeba8ac-9bdb-4040-82e2-320a373c0424-2
00:30:36.603 --> 00:30:40.824
children riding on top
underneath the canopy is heading

ffeba8ac-9bdb-4040-82e2-320a373c0424-3
00:30:40.824 --> 00:30:41.880
towards these.

73f4f891-859a-45af-b203-263ef7a94cdc-0
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.040
235 pyramidal.

48a3276e-d0ac-452d-a840-e51611cfb8fd-0
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.810
Pyramidical structures.

74e1943d-cd63-4656-88d4-c4838b4e89e2-0
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.471
And on the next page, it's a
continuation of the scene that

74e1943d-cd63-4656-88d4-c4838b4e89e2-1
00:30:54.471 --> 00:30:59.608
shows, an another area of the
island with lots of palm trees,

74e1943d-cd63-4656-88d4-c4838b4e89e2-2
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:04.497
and it's also, it shows an
inland of water, a Bay of water

74e1943d-cd63-4656-88d4-c4838b4e89e2-3
00:31:04.497 --> 00:31:06.900
with a waterfall and a beach.

7aca4fd9-ae4b-4bed-b1e7-c05c57dd8055-0
00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.502
That's overlooked by these
pyramids and the path that the

7aca4fd9-ae4b-4bed-b1e7-c05c57dd8055-1
00:31:13.502 --> 00:31:15.630
children are walking on.

0eaaac05-c5ec-4648-889a-e1cabc35f209-0
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:21.928
And in the distance there is
another pyramid and and also

0eaaac05-c5ec-4648-889a-e1cabc35f209-1
00:31:21.928 --> 00:31:27.913
from the Cliff there's a what
looks to be a bridge that leads

0eaaac05-c5ec-4648-889a-e1cabc35f209-2
00:31:27.913 --> 00:31:32.740
to an island made out of stone
with a large tall.

044233df-65a8-45e3-bbaf-c9d7c3b0f71f-0
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.540
Structure on it with a light at
the top.

ae650eaf-113e-407e-9b14-a6a58dce99e1-0
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.791
Across the water coming out of
the water and the sky is blue

ae650eaf-113e-407e-9b14-a6a58dce99e1-1
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.290
with lots of clouds.

845a535b-0295-45fc-89b0-6137ee9f9475-0
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.780


fd70e385-7a4d-42bb-bfac-ecd997ca3bb4-0
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.330
All done.

69b41ea7-3361-4b94-a380-74bf26d0302b-0
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.410
For the next page, the next
picture.

69df4ed1-2dc8-40b7-bee2-77c403ffbf37-0
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.404
Shows that the children have
made their way to the Cliff that

69df4ed1-2dc8-40b7-bee2-77c403ffbf37-1
00:32:12.404 --> 00:32:14.620
holds the bridge, the the.

0fda6bf4-16ea-4f69-ba1b-78e971e2d0f5-0
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.880
The rope bridge.

a27f15ef-ae2c-4d7a-9896-777e1d72da57-0
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.330
That goes over the sea or the
the Bay Area that leads to this.

056e7d76-67a7-4986-93c6-3f88ca79200c-0
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:30.564
Tall pyramidal structure that
has the light on it, and on each

056e7d76-67a7-4986-93c6-3f88ca79200c-1
00:32:30.564 --> 00:32:35.490
side of the structure there are
steps that very steep steps that

056e7d76-67a7-4986-93c6-3f88ca79200c-2
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.280
you can walk up, look down and
go into the water.

79d73b87-5f7e-4234-a19c-0c17b8aa98c3-0
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:48.337
But this rope bridge leads from
the tall steep Cliff across the

79d73b87-5f7e-4234-a19c-0c17b8aa98c3-1
00:32:48.337 --> 00:32:53.110
water to the top of this pyramid
and.

d711733f-952e-48fd-9582-d6b136198a49-0
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:59.829
The children are running across
this bridge that looks rather

d711733f-952e-48fd-9582-d6b136198a49-1
00:32:59.829 --> 00:33:01.800
rickety and unstable.

62bee5aa-2ff9-4dd4-a9ef-119b2221adf5-0
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.975
But they're running away. It
looks like from something

62bee5aa-2ff9-4dd4-a9ef-119b2221adf5-1
00:33:05.975 --> 00:33:10.113
they're looking back over their
shoulder and the purple bird is

62bee5aa-2ff9-4dd4-a9ef-119b2221adf5-2
00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:13.540
flying overhead with them and
staying with them and.

803ab3f0-d18e-4624-bea6-23d532ef59c1-0
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.237
Also in the distance it looks
like there may be other birds in

803ab3f0-d18e-4624-bea6-23d532ef59c1-1
00:33:19.237 --> 00:33:23.991
the sky flying, but it's hard to
say. Still could be some clouds,

803ab3f0-d18e-4624-bea6-23d532ef59c1-2
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:28.169
but anyway the children are
running across this this rope

803ab3f0-d18e-4624-bea6-23d532ef59c1-3
00:33:28.169 --> 00:33:30.330
bridge towards the top of the.

5750aa7b-373d-4b67-b8c6-73337b5e5be9-0
00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.470
Pyramid structure.

bd6d40fa-be43-4b1e-accd-3741347cc397-0
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.940
Towards the light.

c7816e57-5f7c-418c-9b9f-1828a403bdf1-0
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.210
Next page.

49178bdd-ef3b-4960-afce-b64896279885-0
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:46.122
This page, the next page, shows
that they escaped the soldiers

49178bdd-ef3b-4960-afce-b64896279885-1
00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:51.265
who are also running across the
bridge, which was missing a lot

49178bdd-ef3b-4960-afce-b64896279885-2
00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:52.389
of its wooden.

75222941-9daa-4e0b-9865-aa8323f5e988-0
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.500
Wooden

508d128b-bdfd-4edf-84c0-9055db76d354-0
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.610
I don't know what they're
called, planks.

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-0
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.821
But the soldiers are running
across and chasing them, and the

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-1
00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:07.032
children have made it to the
very top of the structure. And

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-2
00:34:07.032 --> 00:34:11.103
they're looking down at the
soldiers who are now crossing

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-3
00:34:11.103 --> 00:34:15.455
the bridge, also in in pursuit
of them. And there are 123, it

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-4
00:34:15.455 --> 00:34:19.806
looks like four soldiers with
Spears chasing the children who

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-5
00:34:19.806 --> 00:34:23.807
are now standing at the top
where the light is. And they

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-6
00:34:23.807 --> 00:34:28.018
have nowhere to go, but they do
have their scrolls in their

1935b833-1506-43a7-b45c-cea21f676f4e-7
00:34:28.018 --> 00:34:28.439
hands.

a6dab99a-b305-4761-9539-200d941d77e7-0
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.860
And their bird, the purple bird,
is there, flying above them.

14c7f496-dde1-4d2b-9a8c-a5609b87f041-0
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.090
Um, possibly guiding them where
to go next.

9a7707f9-6fbe-4c94-8fc8-43c3c17a1c37-0
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.660
So in the next page they have
taken out their magic scrolls.

ad991b29-1665-4530-912c-839146cc9958-0
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:50.512
And or have changed them into
their markers again and they're

ad991b29-1665-4530-912c-839146cc9958-1
00:34:50.512 --> 00:34:55.528
drawing. The little girl's
drawing a plank or little what

ad991b29-1665-4530-912c-839146cc9958-2
00:34:55.528 --> 00:35:00.544
looks like to be a red box, and
the little boy is drawing

ad991b29-1665-4530-912c-839146cc9958-3
00:35:00.544 --> 00:35:01.150
purple.

e603d700-624d-4a92-adc2-31079b35cc71-0
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.160
Looks like propellers, he's
drawn 4.

9d2dc5da-d160-43c5-9f55-911ca8588ddc-0

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.430
And then the next picture.

d520fdef-31db-4243-9443-8c81eacdc8b3-0
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:30.330
The dirigibles with the soldiers
in our have turned away and

d520fdef-31db-4243-9443-8c81eacdc8b3-1
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.680
they're heading back.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:38.503
I cannot tell if the children
left with them or if they're on

f0acfae5-87e4-44b0-9807-6dc11df99e05-1
00:42:38.503 --> 00:42:43.765
them, but they are flying away
and you can see that it's

f0acfae5-87e4-44b0-9807-6dc11df99e05-2
00:42:43.765 --> 00:42:49.120
snowing and that the skies are
dark and the soldiers are.

d741ba3e-e8d0-4e87-8de1-f9ad29aa1ee8-0
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.830
The three ships are flying away.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.980
Soldiers are back in the
picture. The children are still

21d27642-a3d3-4f6c-8938-1f8e2c4f31fc-1
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.910
standing on top of the
monuments.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.070
Holding on to this cone shaped.

cone shaped structure.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.590
And as the bird flies away.

af6bc73d-3aad-410f-83d5-ab832cd3a53c-0
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.470
He leaves a rainbow of color.

e389fc45-b35f-41ed-931b-9b1db2d38e79-0
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.035
That's made by the colorful
scrolls that were in the sash

e389fc45-b35f-41ed-931b-9b1db2d38e79-1
00:43:39.035 --> 00:43:41.300
that the girl gave to the bird.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:47.322
And the the color from the
rainbow is so bright that it

191e96c4-ac66-452c-a7d4-6e48ebb090fd-1
00:43:47.322 --> 00:43:52.920
startles the the men and the
dirigible and the the man in.

5ee58577-7e92-420f-83df-9c9e5e889326-0
00:43:53.650 --> 00:44:00.740
This soldier in gold and it's a
shocks the gerbil dirigibles and

5ee58577-7e92-420f-83df-9c9e5e889326-1
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.540
throws them off course. And one
of them is.

8367e1a0-7cb5-463a-936c-497a4e1e5eba-0
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.557
Tumbles and then the soldiers
fall out and are trying to hold

8367e1a0-7cb5-463a-936c-497a4e1e5eba-1
00:44:11.557 --> 00:44:12.860
on to stay inside.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:19.842
And the next picture shows that
the bird is heading towards the

21c287cd-8f61-4a71-9523-1b7bd076f940-1
00:44:19.842 --> 00:44:22.180
city, back towards the city.

d1c270d1-448d-4533-8117-5c598059ec9d-0
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.926
With the rainbow of color
following it, and in that

d1c270d1-448d-4533-8117-5c598059ec9d-1
00:44:27.926 --> 00:44:32.684
picture also shows the third
dirigible just tumbling through

d1c270d1-448d-4533-8117-5c598059ec9d-2
00:44:32.684 --> 00:44:37.286
the sky and all the soldiers
falling out of it. And one of

d1c270d1-448d-4533-8117-5c598059ec9d-3
00:44:37.286 --> 00:44:42.200
the soldiers has a golden cage
that I finally see in his hand.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.630
And so he is trying to hold on
to that golden cage.

3749d4fe-1369-450d-bcfb-da9e20d1789f-0
00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:54.648
And in the background is the
city with the golden domes and

3749d4fe-1369-450d-bcfb-da9e20d1789f-1
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:57.850
the the tall buildings sitting
on the water.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:01.400
And.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.560
The rainbow coming from the top
of the mountain in the distance.

acb9b426-9fba-4328-b4eb-9554cd23c23a-0
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:16.940

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.674
There was a snow covered
mountain and it lands on the

8bd1aae6-d968-4a58-b134-f663886a5413-1
00:45:24.674 --> 00:45:27.190

That the.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.820
The king was floating in and
this rainbow.

0b6ef2ef-4e5c-4ee9-8d84-0a2853f9df8f-0
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:40.010
Brings joy to the king and
strength to the king, but it

0b6ef2ef-4e5c-4ee9-8d84-0a2853f9df8f-1
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:45.081
looks like it's destroying the
soldiers, and the soldiers are

0b6ef2ef-4e5c-4ee9-8d84-0a2853f9df8f-2
00:45:45.081 --> 00:45:48.190
falling from the boat into the
water.

a6b1be0b-83f2-4a26-be3e-2c69ff60778f-0
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:54.250
And falling off the walls of the
city and.

95a873c2-b7dc-42df-be42-2d7af7ae6281-0
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.660
Bringing light to the city.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.030
It's reflected in the water that
is flowing.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:11.290
On the river, past the city and
past the aqueducts of the city

8e402884-a845-4411-bad3-6bdd3e9a7954-1
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.070
walls and the bird.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.721
Has brought this the rainbow and
the joy to the king and the

00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:23.182
city, and it looks to be like
he's going to fly out of the

14b7a9db-a490-440d-9286-f3418fa005b3-2
00:46:23.182 --> 00:46:24.770

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:18.676
And and it's shining on the city
with the stone city with lots of

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:39.460
It's not a it's not a river, but
it kind of looks like a river,

22126773-e62f-4d9d-a741-5b526ac30e79-1
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.430

waterway.

into the city because that they

Almost like a a wand, but it's a
crooked wand in his hands. It's

The King has also placed the
crown on the little girl's head

00:52:04.692 --> 00:52:06.940

her red crayon, and the little

a4dd7f91-2bdf-4240-8bdb-50545c5c77fd-0
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.916
It looks like some of the people
are trying to fight back the the

a4dd7f91-2bdf-4240-8bdb-50545c5c77fd-1
00:56:56.916 --> 00:57:00.381
of the little people they
there's like there's some

a4dd7f91-2bdf-4240-8bdb-50545c5c77fd-2
00:57:00.381 --> 00:57:04.311
soldiers on horseback, there's a
king that have swords and

a4dd7f91-2bdf-4240-8bdb-50545c5c77fd-3
00:57:04.311 --> 00:57:06.910
they're trying to hurt the
giants but.

bdbaab00-64a5-4eaf-86fc-99cf679a3777-0
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.101
They're not quite able to take
control of the situation. They

bdbaab00-64a5-4eaf-86fc-99cf679a3777-1
00:57:13.101 --> 00:57:17.423
have a a one of those things
from old times, old English

bdbaab00-64a5-4eaf-86fc-99cf679a3777-2
00:57:17.423 --> 00:57:22.124
times that what that throw, I
forget, catapult that throw the

bdbaab00-64a5-4eaf-86fc-99cf679a3777-3
00:57:22.124 --> 00:57:27.052
balls and one of the one of the
catapults has shot a big boulder

bdbaab00-64a5-4eaf-86fc-99cf679a3777-4
00:57:27.052 --> 00:57:30.010
and hit one of the giants in the
head.

a2a31bfd-fd8a-4d15-ab2a-3ffcf661a7ae-0
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.470
He has the face of, like, what
just hit me.

8a5febff-3df1-4d6d-9dc9-02fb2d0934e2-0
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.450
And there are some other.

acfb4c13-06c9-44d6-9a95-7ff5661257bc-0
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:43.046
It's hard to tell what actually
else is going on down there, but

acfb4c13-06c9-44d6-9a95-7ff5661257bc-1
00:57:43.046 --> 00:57:47.286
there's also another group of
little people that that has a a

acfb4c13-06c9-44d6-9a95-7ff5661257bc-2
00:57:47.286 --> 00:57:51.732
towering catapult with a hammer
on it, and they're just about to

acfb4c13-06c9-44d6-9a95-7ff5661257bc-3
00:57:51.732 --> 00:57:55.700
hit one of the giants on the
head with this giant hammer.

02d06f31-3f75-40c3-945b-42fb221b46ef-0
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:04.147
In the middle of the scene there
are five giants. Four of them

02d06f31-3f75-40c3-945b-42fb221b46ef-1
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:10.630
are men giants, and one, Oh no,
it's just four male giants.

694abbee-0178-4541-8ccc-c5cb9806afcb-0
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:13.330
And they are.

e158f712-0e1a-4fc5-9989-729f3609a11b-0
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.400
Looks like they are going to
lasso.

fe7bd2e1-0c34-4ad4-bb38-a9945c30d7cf-0
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.830
One of the houses with the.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:27.258
With the little people's houses,
they've put a rope around and

70de3f61-c561-4d5a-a46d-4ad5ce3ddc0f-1
00:58:27.258 --> 00:58:28.190
lasso around it.

c8c5ccc6-67a9-459d-ad66-39b7dfc9cbb4-0
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.940
Not sure what they're going to
do, except possibly destroy it.

89bf0f0f-96be-4161-98cf-1b3d22aaed9a-0
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:39.594
One of the Giants is walking
around with little people in his

89bf0f0f-96be-4161-98cf-1b3d22aaed9a-1
00:58:39.594 --> 00:58:39.980
belt.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:42.890
And then,

5896749b-8e5e-4605-a9ec-fcb800ccec57-0
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:45.310
The little people are.

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.180
Being very.

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.880


ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-0
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:55.730
um creative and attracting one
of the Giants to them to

ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-1
00:58:55.730 --> 00:59:00.726
hopefully hurt him and get rid
of him. They've they've built a

ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-2
00:59:00.726 --> 00:59:05.563
wooden woman, giant female giant
waving hello and one of the

ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-3
00:59:05.563 --> 00:59:10.321
giants is headed towards her
with a bouquet of pink flowers

ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-4
00:59:10.321 --> 00:59:15.238
and a little heart over his head
thinking that he will get to

ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-5
00:59:15.238 --> 00:59:19.837
know this wooden woman but
behind, hidden behind her is a

ca9e4366-8d8e-40d6-aff2-9f0357fd2d3d-6
00:59:19.837 --> 00:59:20.710
tall tower.

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:26.740
catapult mallet that will.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:31.817
Hit the giant on the head as he
gets closer to this fake wooden

32b90533-2fd1-4391-a287-45ce9721a70a-1
00:59:31.817 --> 00:59:32.230
woman.

ad8ecd99-fb3d-43ad-9c55-59f745e79fc5-0
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:38.903
The same thing is happening on
the left side of the picture

ad8ecd99-fb3d-43ad-9c55-59f745e79fc5-1
00:59:38.903 --> 00:59:43.420
with another giant who is
attracted to the another wooden

ad8ecd99-fb3d-43ad-9c55-59f745e79fc5-2
00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:48.327
woman who is standing in front
of a hidden catapult with a big

ad8ecd99-fb3d-43ad-9c55-59f745e79fc5-3
00:59:48.327 --> 00:59:53.234
mallet on top, and she's wearing
a light blue skirt with a red

ad8ecd99-fb3d-43ad-9c55-59f745e79fc5-4

00:59:56.950 --> 01:00:01.129
So that's all happening in the
middle of the picture and then

c8f982be-e5f3-4dfb-871a-040f1e2fa727-1
01:00:01.129 --> 01:00:04.770
at the top of the picture it
shows that a large hill.

b38af837-a86b-4d43-8440-1d038563ab1e-0
01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.390
Umm.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:11.743
But compared to the Giants, it's
not very large, but the hill

88267f3c-ecf9-4f0c-a08b-c09888c1af0b-1
01:00:11.743 --> 01:00:16.471
rises up out of a river, and at
the top of the hill the little

88267f3c-ecf9-4f0c-a08b-c09888c1af0b-2
01:00:16.471 --> 01:00:20.600
people had built a stone village
that the Giants have.

e07dd31c-97e5-4891-a578-86de5391407a-0
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.660
Have encircled and are taking
little people and putting them

e07dd31c-97e5-4891-a578-86de5391407a-1
01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:34.353
in their belts and trying to
harm them. One of the Giants has

e07dd31c-97e5-4891-a578-86de5391407a-2
01:00:34.353 --> 01:00:40.321
ripped up a tree and is sweeping
the little people away with it,

e07dd31c-97e5-4891-a578-86de5391407a-3
01:00:40.321 --> 01:00:44.820
and another giant is spinning
that the windmill.

604c34b0-a2bc-4fc1-af37-2b43a1d55618-0
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.780
Really fast and and ruining it
and.

a4381cb9-a221-4c91-9dc7-f69d76c7f2d4-0
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:55.164
Also, the little people have
built another wooden woman and

a4381cb9-a221-4c91-9dc7-f69d76c7f2d4-1
01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:59.063
then this one. They've actually
been able to hit the giant in

a4381cb9-a221-4c91-9dc7-f69d76c7f2d4-2
01:00:59.063 --> 01:00:59.630
the head.

bb65e24c-19ee-4b23-9d77-20cbdfd829fa-0
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.240
So it's really a scene of chaos
that this giant that these

bb65e24c-19ee-4b23-9d77-20cbdfd829fa-1
01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.993
giants have brought to the

Village.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.833
And they're doing their best to
destroy it, while the little

5a50741e-394a-4cd2-8941-73304ad81fdd-1
01:01:15.833 --> 01:01:20.055
people are doing their best to
save it by attacking the the

5a50741e-394a-4cd2-8941-73304ad81fdd-2
01:01:20.055 --> 01:01:22.660
giants with whatever means they
can.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.720
And everybody's very colorful.

c5d74bcd-a83a-4088-9111-7f91650d4efa-0
01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:33.664
The Giants have red and blue and
green and yellow bright yellow

c5d74bcd-a83a-4088-9111-7f91650d4efa-1
01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:39.079
striped clothing and the little
people are also in mostly

c5d74bcd-a83a-4088-9111-7f91650d4efa-2

suitcase beside them. The next

Then the second picture is a

It's hard to say, but it looks
like it's there. On the next

3c041dde-7516-45d9-8a27-6e1cc6b64f03-1

He's looking at something in the
sky.

7c6b78bd-343c-4eed-8b1e-26fd8bda0f75-0
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:30.886
That's bright. He's got his
hands protecting his eyes so

7c6b78bd-343c-4eed-8b1e-26fd8bda0f75-1
01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:35.640

01:06:54.587 --> 01:07:00.574
crossing the water, and on the
boat are many people. All of

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.303
Where maybe sound would come
from or smoke would come from to

28ebf25b-3c26-4d0b-aaf4-81c7cae4fa18-1
01:07:18.303 --> 01:07:20.120

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:26.734
But above these, above them all,
are these white birds that are

5068f383-c08d-4a32-90a7-b5fc2d595c59-1

01:13:41.026 --> 01:13:44.565
looks like they don't know what
what they need to do.

aa65b049-7252-4293-8ba5-98b408ba6b8c-3

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:27.090
is stuff from the parlor lead up
to, but if you were to go into.

c29e6190-4dc0-4815-9cb4-fa7990ff03c2-0
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:33.197
The next room you would find
yourself in the kitchen, and

c29e6190-4dc0-4815-9cb4-fa7990ff03c2-1
01:18:33.197 --> 01:18:36.430
from the kitchen they have, they
have.

4f917637-1e4a-4f65-ae2a-2ac9f2c1385a-0
01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.923
The the maids stairs that go up
the back stairs and those stairs

4f917637-1e4a-4f65-ae2a-2ac9f2c1385a-1
01:18:41.923 --> 01:18:43.740
lead to the second floor.

e34ebe44-d30d-4973-ba15-b94bbb6de18d-0
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:47.910
And up on the 2nd floor is the
hallway.

1ec7e9a5-b23e-4a10-ab3b-6d995b20fd28-0
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:53.010
Where you that leads into the
young man's room.

c063c654-1bf2-4f40-9df0-b2b3d306ca0f-0
01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:54.950
Umm.

280ae07d-61c1-43c6-bd4c-06126b5ae1f1-0
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.710
At the top of the steps.

2585fd88-adc2-4193-ba03-dd6ca71d5ae7-0
01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.004
There is a sitting area where it
has a couch and a little table

2585fd88-adc2-4193-ba03-dd6ca71d5ae7-1
01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:07.190
with a plant, and a table that
has a television on it and a

2585fd88-adc2-4193-ba03-dd6ca71d5ae7-2
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.400
blanket so that whoever can sit
on the chair.

f71b0056-89c4-4d5e-8f26-3a1ba2fca333-0
01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.556
Can stay warm underneath the
blanket. There are also a few

f71b0056-89c4-4d5e-8f26-3a1ba2fca333-1
01:19:15.556 --> 01:19:16.580
pictures on the.

30625a00-10cc-4dae-ac33-10602edc1b2f-0
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.300
On the walls in this room.

e4ef1393-8706-426d-b738-62f8b7a31826-0
01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.400
And the door in the wall.

f03c9d01-bc3a-4560-a4b4-bfdc5675f4e5-0
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.910
That leads to another room.

df84db3c-0040-41a0-9cf8-12c81fea3bed-0
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.880
That has the bed in it, and A
and a a wall lamp.

33ef0a67-aeee-4293-86d0-15151ddc7f73-0
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:37.348
It can be used to use a reading
lamp that's comes out from the

33ef0a67-aeee-4293-86d0-15151ddc7f73-1
01:19:37.348 --> 01:19:37.730
wall.

8cfdd34e-a2c3-40fc-9462-83eadff7aa85-0
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.100
And there's a cat laying on the
bed.

9d955d2f-a3a4-48c6-9648-50adac52022f-0
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:44.100
And it's not a very big bedroom.

1d637704-cb01-4ba8-b68b-d120d00bc138-0
01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.720
But it has a door that leads
into a bathroom that that would

1d637704-cb01-4ba8-b68b-d120d00bc138-1
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.270
be an on suite bathroom for the
bedroom.

66783cfe-d013-46f0-81d9-f01fb776dfc3-0
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:59.180
And in that that bathroom,
there's a pedestal sink.

24d02a0a-69d1-428a-b7c3-7a6773fb9824-0
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.190
And a couple light.

188feca3-9186-4781-8df6-686217b9648b-0
01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:04.620
A light.

14db7dfb-0be3-4cd8-a42f-0c230a64b3d3-0
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:07.130
Asking.

8de8e390-9ede-4472-b0a7-cf8f78e83b51-0
01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:12.935
It's a typical bathroom with a
pedestal sink and a mirror on

8de8e390-9ede-4472-b0a7-cf8f78e83b51-1
01:20:12.935 --> 01:20:17.816
the wall and a lamp coming out
of the wall so that you can see

8de8e390-9ede-4472-b0a7-cf8f78e83b51-2
01:20:17.816 --> 01:20:20.450
while you're in the bathroom
and.

23aa5135-4709-4d7f-9b43-eb30d1ba7d53-0
01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.540
And then there are also two
pictures on the wall with the.

59b4ed81-6f19-42cc-9ced-d99784a4e700-0
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:28.020
That little trash can next to
the the sink.

5f42d175-3460-448a-af65-4609975742be-0
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:34.296
And that is all on the 2nd
floor. On the 1st floor, as you

5f42d175-3460-448a-af65-4609975742be-1
01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:39.253
enter, you come into the parlor
area. That leads you into the

5f42d175-3460-448a-af65-4609975742be-2
01:20:39.253 --> 01:20:44.290
kitchen area, which has a stove
and a sink and some cabinetry.

2a542165-3fb9-4e86-b16f-fe3b9442f3cd-0
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.107
And then from the kitchen you
can walk forward through a door

2a542165-3fb9-4e86-b16f-fe3b9442f3cd-1
01:20:51.107 --> 01:20:56.012
that takes you into the little a
little child's bedroom with a

2a542165-3fb9-4e86-b16f-fe3b9442f3cd-2
01:20:56.012 --> 01:20:57.570
twin size bed and a.

334a0dc1-1e04-47b9-bd1b-5bc98c28e439-0
01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.204
What looks like a map on the
wall. There's also a window in

334a0dc1-1e04-47b9-bd1b-5bc98c28e439-1
01:21:02.204 --> 01:21:06.048
this little boy's room, and
underneath the window there's a

334a0dc1-1e04-47b9-bd1b-5bc98c28e439-2
01:21:06.048 --> 01:21:08.739
his dresser with a little lamp
on it and.

873438b1-9721-406e-b3ff-e63775ccb534-0
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:11.150
All kinds of things.

6b380c47-1b7f-4a38-b2c2-8d230202098a-0
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:18.151
Be using in his room and the
picture of little boy, he has a

6b380c47-1b7f-4a38-b2c2-8d230202098a-1
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:23.864
crown and something red in his
left arm that he's holding and

6b380c47-1b7f-4a38-b2c2-8d230202098a-2
01:21:23.864 --> 01:21:29.577
in his right hand arm he has a
red marker and he's drawing an

6b380c47-1b7f-4a38-b2c2-8d230202098a-3
01:21:29.577 --> 01:21:35.659
arch on the wall that looks like
maybe becoming a door, a doorway

6b380c47-1b7f-4a38-b2c2-8d230202098a-4
01:21:35.659 --> 01:21:39.530
to the walls. So again, there's
color in.

44137c36-39ca-4893-97b5-2ed8c6972603-0
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:42.740
Only two rooms of this house.

bd0b1941-f23a-4e0b-8895-59dfcf07d32d-0
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:47.373
The young man, the older man
who's drawing it up in his room

bd0b1941-f23a-4e0b-8895-59dfcf07d32d-1
01:21:47.373 --> 01:21:48.680
on the second floor.

1ae5bb06-a1f0-4fc9-9d10-6d0286b750e2-0
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:54.333
That the kite, the red kite has
flown into, and then on the

1ae5bb06-a1f0-4fc9-9d10-6d0286b750e2-1
01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:59.211
bottom room, the the 1st floor,
the far room to the right of the

1ae5bb06-a1f0-4fc9-9d10-6d0286b750e2-2
01:21:59.211 --> 01:22:03.790
house, there's a little boy who
has a gold crown and a white

1ae5bb06-a1f0-4fc9-9d10-6d0286b750e2-3
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:08.443
shirt and some blue pants and
brown shoes, who's drawing with

1ae5bb06-a1f0-4fc9-9d10-6d0286b750e2-4
01:22:08.443 --> 01:22:10.470
the red marker on the wall.

7ed2222b-4d46-427d-ae9b-c81b041cda14-0
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.950
Next page.

f7bce4a9-d816-420e-b3a8-d98bd2177ebd-0
01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:20.545
So on this white page is a page
that has three scenes. The top

f7bce4a9-d816-420e-b3a8-d98bd2177ebd-1
01:22:20.545 --> 01:22:25.351
scene is of the man sitting at
the desk drawing wearing a blue

f7bce4a9-d816-420e-b3a8-d98bd2177ebd-2
01:22:25.351 --> 01:22:28.249
light blue shirt and Navy blue
pants.

18d5fba4-da00-4260-9831-f6df0e164bad-0
01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.157
He turns around, he hears
something and turns around and

18d5fba4-da00-4260-9831-f6df0e164bad-1
01:22:32.157 --> 01:22:35.020
sees that there's the kite is
laying on the ground.

f718a350-4c30-4f2d-aa1d-18971560c54d-0
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.796
In the next scene underneath
that, the man is gotten up from

f718a350-4c30-4f2d-aa1d-18971560c54d-1
01:22:39.796 --> 01:22:43.663
his chair and picked up the red
kite and is looking at it

f718a350-4c30-4f2d-aa1d-18971560c54d-2
01:22:43.663 --> 01:22:44.330
perplexed.

4c57482e-68b6-4de4-857c-08ce4eae5c11-0
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.890
And in the third scene on the
bottom.

2d024c10-59aa-464b-91d1-5580f3f988ec-0
01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:49.260
Umm.

63950751-a758-4b90-b669-bfce3f0f6b48-0
01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.050
The man has left.

2344b048-5a75-4e38-8762-2ccbf5fc10ca-0
01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.440
And this kite is still laying on
the floor.

78fca606-ef1c-4451-aabe-a931dd56c1ef-0
01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.350
And as we look to the next page.

28bcb1f9-290b-4455-a9a3-aca5c7c7d489-0
01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:01.990
The man has.

adc1fcbf-0523-48f5-b201-6f186fce2f24-0
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.638
Gone to find the little boy, so
he has gone down the steps to

adc1fcbf-0523-48f5-b201-6f186fce2f24-1
01:23:07.638 --> 01:23:09.210
the little boys room.

3a6da358-0f9a-48dc-882d-90bac21426db-0
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.230
And sees that.

8dfb0f21-27e2-4732-8d39-06c878d85216-0
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:14.820
The that the little boy has.

33874d78-df02-4a10-ac3a-1c78735a4146-0
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:21.435
Made a door, red door out of his
room and so the picture is of

33874d78-df02-4a10-ac3a-1c78735a4146-1
01:23:21.435 --> 01:23:27.265
the little boys room and the man
is looking through this red door

33874d78-df02-4a10-ac3a-1c78735a4146-2
01:23:27.265 --> 01:23:32.741
that's bent over and is looking
through the red door that has

33874d78-df02-4a10-ac3a-1c78735a4146-3
01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:38.395
some bright light coming out of
and I'm wondering what is going

33874d78-df02-4a10-ac3a-1c78735a4146-4
01:23:38.395 --> 01:23:38.660
on.

dc1a6f03-5180-46ed-b410-c842293cc913-0
01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:49.560
And the man decides to walk
through that red door that the

dc1a6f03-5180-46ed-b410-c842293cc913-1
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:54.929
little boy drew, and he enters
into a beautiful forest that has

dc1a6f03-5180-46ed-b410-c842293cc913-2
01:23:54.929 --> 01:24:00.131
lots of candle Candelaria and
lanterns hanging from the trees

dc1a6f03-5180-46ed-b410-c842293cc913-3
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:04.830
and and small lights on stream
that are hanging to the.

430c2844-9989-4ced-a8e8-439da7371e17-0
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:08.050
Of.

44489c21-9d44-4871-b689-0047bc43987b-0
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.930
Life in the forest and in the
dark and.

bd002222-6a4b-4813-bc28-8d308cfd4d9b-0
01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:23.772
The trees are growing alongside
a pond or a river and jutting

bd002222-6a4b-4813-bc28-8d308cfd4d9b-1
01:24:23.772 --> 01:24:25.620
out from the.

9f9c2b4f-14de-419c-804d-30e2237f3862-0
01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:29.000
The land is a small.

a25701dc-916d-47df-bf93-3295e9206532-0
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.770
Dock.

724ac66f-21e3-45af-a85b-1e7c9b570225-0
01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:37.645
And on that dock it's a small
red ball and the man sees it

724ac66f-21e3-45af-a85b-1e7c9b570225-1
01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:38.000
and.

fd28985e-bc6e-4746-afba-36f713ebc068-0
01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:40.610
He's on the other side of the
water.

dd1c5f99-71e4-4dcf-81f4-0f67f1ff81f5-0
01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:44.670
But he starts to walk towards
the dock and the ball.

e339050d-c654-4132-8bd7-c47891bda58e-0
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:47.040
And turn the page.

2e4e20ac-6fd2-4fb5-a203-2636e764e526-0
01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.420
And he finds his way across the
water.

40a70b25-4f7b-4713-a977-eb4e25fde7c5-0
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:59.200
And in this picture we see the
man standing on the wooden dock.

aa0fcdc3-0931-442e-a7e5-8f2a837a77a7-0
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.970
Holding the red ball.

f33b49f1-05e0-44d5-9882-d3518299296b-0
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:03.310
Umm.

52c1e6f6-4526-45c6-9363-e0466c81eae6-0
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:08.696
And there are again that the
trees are filled with these

52c1e6f6-4526-45c6-9363-e0466c81eae6-1
01:25:08.696 --> 01:25:09.690
lanterns of.

fb3ee46b-4f65-4a87-875c-8da84b6ebf79-0
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:17.304
Red reddish light and the force
is lit up and along the

fb3ee46b-4f65-4a87-875c-8da84b6ebf79-1
01:25:17.304 --> 01:25:24.123
waterway. Coming towards the man
is a boat, it's an animal. It's

fb3ee46b-4f65-4a87-875c-8da84b6ebf79-2
01:25:24.123 --> 01:25:27.690
a boat that looks like an
animal.

2e40efc7-09fb-4eb5-a19b-658b998a2699-0
01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.078
In the front it looks like it
has the head of a horse, but on

2e40efc7-09fb-4eb5-a19b-658b998a2699-1
01:25:34.078 --> 01:25:38.773
the back it has the tail
feathers of a bird or the fins

2e40efc7-09fb-4eb5-a19b-658b998a2699-2
01:25:38.773 --> 01:25:44.307
of a of a of something. But this
thing is gently riding along the

2e40efc7-09fb-4eb5-a19b-658b998a2699-3
01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:49.505
the water towards around the
bend towards the man holding the

2e40efc7-09fb-4eb5-a19b-658b998a2699-4
01:25:49.505 --> 01:25:50.260
red ball.

2a141265-a04d-4c27-a137-d5914041aafe-0
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:56.834
And the next page is of white
page with three different scenes

2a141265-a04d-4c27-a137-d5914041aafe-1
01:25:56.834 --> 01:25:57.830
at the top.

d5bd5d46-824b-4019-8023-fcdcf31d9270-0
01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.701
The boat with the forehead or
kangaroo even had has stopped at

d5bd5d46-824b-4019-8023-fcdcf31d9270-1
01:26:03.701 --> 01:26:07.810
the dock and the man is looking
at it holding the ball.

8925c887-274c-4b6b-b48f-a7d21254172b-0
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:11.550
But the boat just.

e1f5c7cd-2a22-4674-98b9-cb1f44ef3143-0
01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:17.466
Continues past and it surprises
the man and so instead of just

e1f5c7cd-2a22-4674-98b9-cb1f44ef3143-1
01:26:17.466 --> 01:26:22.090
standing there he decides to
jump onto the boat. So he jumps

e1f5c7cd-2a22-4674-98b9-cb1f44ef3143-2
01:26:22.090 --> 01:26:26.942
onto the boat holding the hand
and the last scene on the bottom

e1f5c7cd-2a22-4674-98b9-cb1f44ef3143-3
01:26:26.942 --> 01:26:31.870
of the page is the man standing
on the boat holding the ball and

e1f5c7cd-2a22-4674-98b9-cb1f44ef3143-4
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:36.040
crouched over as the boat
continues to leave the page.

88cad017-37e8-4009-b63e-5015d523e16b-0
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:43.010
This page is shows the boat is
heading towards.

9aaaf2c8-1f43-43e6-88ad-b70ae83bc061-0
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.310
A great castle.

4ada6dd0-62bb-41c9-8a8f-b31e91375b41-0
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:52.201
And the man is standing on the
boat with his hands, his arm

4ada6dd0-62bb-41c9-8a8f-b31e91375b41-1
01:26:52.201 --> 01:26:53.980
raised above his head.

f6ec27c2-97fe-4292-b644-67dfe25d07a1-0
01:26:55.870 --> 01:27:00.796
Trying to see what what's ahead
of him. He is still holding the

f6ec27c2-97fe-4292-b644-67dfe25d07a1-1
01:27:00.796 --> 01:27:05.723
red ball and he looks like he's
trying to decide where the boat

f6ec27c2-97fe-4292-b644-67dfe25d07a1-2
01:27:05.723 --> 01:27:06.570
is heading.

3d4b56f8-bcb8-4d9f-8f3f-fbecaf77fafd-0
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:13.792
The entrance to the city is is
covered by two wooden doors that

3d4b56f8-bcb8-4d9f-8f3f-fbecaf77fafd-1
01:27:13.792 --> 01:27:17.990
are opening as the boat
approaches on the water.

cf32f82f-7f39-40b4-b5df-23cdfe6fb247-0
01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:22.100
And pretty soon, the vote will
pass through.

96a0555a-c8b6-419e-8d44-7a39ba7b6b61-0
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.630
The gate into a long.

7dd8e598-e9ed-4f4a-9d6e-f6689db41d0d-0
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.110
Hallway.

d3ca43d9-cef1-4405-a495-b45786058a18-0
01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:31.340
And the next page.

ddeb4a87-e1ed-42f3-b849-7b03c1abd360-0
01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:37.879
Is a picture of the night with a
beautiful full moon in the sky

ddeb4a87-e1ed-42f3-b849-7b03c1abd360-1
01:27:37.879 --> 01:27:40.850
that that's is shining on the
water.

ea571c11-20b6-4d3e-adbe-6326baf44ca2-0
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:42.090
And.

c8262483-a347-41ab-ba78-bbfbd1106242-0
01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:46.680
In this picture is.

a3716fdb-64af-4d34-90bc-0a0c7388b886-0
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:50.200
Shows an archway of a city.

83d0eed5-0ef4-469c-87e7-6a92c7b65b77-0
01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:56.570
That that spans over a body of
water.

98830838-0881-46d1-97ff-c3c5787fbe76-0
01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:02.870
And it's part of the city that
the man was entering in, but.

50aa7a1e-74f5-4271-bbf1-575416d0528f-0
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:06.370
Hmm.

510d9445-825d-45b5-bac8-9b5e51bcb4b9-0
01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.190
It looks like.

0b4f103d-7c39-4243-87d3-e36b138f1e38-0
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.510
The little boy.

4e73dbfa-c358-49cc-879e-fe94bae4ab18-0
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:17.690
Is riding in a boat cross the
bridge.

67e58fe4-eaff-4de7-93d0-e0070671c362-0
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:24.572
From one part of the city to the
next, Umm. On the left side of

67e58fe4-eaff-4de7-93d0-e0070671c362-1
01:28:24.572 --> 01:28:30.156
the city are the golden domes on
top of the buildings. And the

67e58fe4-eaff-4de7-93d0-e0070671c362-2
01:28:30.156 --> 01:28:35.917
man, maybe the man. When he has
his hands raised to his eyes, he

67e58fe4-eaff-4de7-93d0-e0070671c362-3
01:28:35.917 --> 01:28:37.690
sees the little boy.

f5623e93-14f4-4a9c-9493-a9eb87c6b003-0
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.190
Riding across the bridge and
he's trying to to catch up to

f5623e93-14f4-4a9c-9493-a9eb87c6b003-1
01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:47.421
him, but the little boy is
almost to the other side of the

f5623e93-14f4-4a9c-9493-a9eb87c6b003-2
01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:51.150
bridge and to the other side of
the city next page.

274000f6-53ad-401c-8980-a823853d3be5-0
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:58.680
And it shows that the man.

a3ca0583-5f5a-43dc-8894-ec92fe70f5fc-0
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:05.040
Was riding the boat and it did
catch up to the little boy.

90ea9415-21a7-427f-9a6e-8cee94a6e72a-0
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.880
Leaves.

a36f55c7-43d2-4324-94b2-7f49fcf3235e-0
01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:14.021
The the horse boat and the gall
behind and jumps onto the dock,

a36f55c7-43d2-4324-94b2-7f49fcf3235e-1
01:29:14.021 --> 01:29:20.039
just as the little boy and the
little girl are walking up the

a36f55c7-43d2-4324-94b2-7f49fcf3235e-2
01:29:20.039 --> 01:29:25.280
steps towards the king and the
purple bird that were.

ca7a20ca-d860-4a7e-b18b-d31adbd03564-0
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:30.289
In another part of the scene,
the little Boy and girl were

ca7a20ca-d860-4a7e-b18b-d31adbd03564-1
01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:31.780
riding on a red boat.

23f54216-4ca9-4574-900b-3e26261c9efa-0
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:37.467
And that is also docked and they
are being welcomed by the king

23f54216-4ca9-4574-900b-3e26261c9efa-1
01:29:37.467 --> 01:29:40.170
and they both still have their
crowns on.

655a29f6-60ba-4223-8b57-bef8ec2ae847-0
01:29:41.670 --> 01:29:45.391
And to the lower part of the
picture, there are some soldiers

655a29f6-60ba-4223-8b57-bef8ec2ae847-1
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:49.233
standing there. One has a bugle
or trumpet in his hand, and the

655a29f6-60ba-4223-8b57-bef8ec2ae847-2
01:29:49.233 --> 01:29:52.775
other, they both have trumpets
in their hands, and they're

655a29f6-60ba-4223-8b57-bef8ec2ae847-3
01:29:52.775 --> 01:29:56.256
looking at each other and
looking at the the king. And as

655a29f6-60ba-4223-8b57-bef8ec2ae847-4
01:29:56.256 --> 01:29:59.978
the father jumps out of the boat
onto the dock, he raises his

655a29f6-60ba-4223-8b57-bef8ec2ae847-5
01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:02.679
hand and calls to the children
and the king.

ea8e5edd-5318-4dbd-949f-1cc64aa79acf-0
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:10.002
And on the next page it's a
white page with with one single

ea8e5edd-5318-4dbd-949f-1cc64aa79acf-1
01:30:10.002 --> 01:30:10.580
scene.

02844962-0d4a-429c-89ad-935c5f375c12-0
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:15.991
And the man is reaching out
towards the king, but the

02844962-0d4a-429c-89ad-935c5f375c12-1
01:30:15.991 --> 01:30:18.000
children are ignoring him.

8f61e78e-f2e7-457a-ae0b-acb430441228-0
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:19.750
And the little girl.

e0a384ce-9b05-45a8-a3af-3d5386f213e1-0
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:23.860
Crosses her arms and turns her
head away.

154a1bdf-08fb-40b3-b0fd-206e009ea6c8-0
01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.293
As if she doesn't want to see
her father and the little boys

154a1bdf-08fb-40b3-b0fd-206e009ea6c8-1
01:30:28.293 --> 01:30:31.906
back to him and he's walking
towards his sister. Neither of

154a1bdf-08fb-40b3-b0fd-206e009ea6c8-2
01:30:31.906 --> 01:30:35.640
them are paying attention to
their father except for the king

154a1bdf-08fb-40b3-b0fd-206e009ea6c8-3
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.350
who's looking at the children
and wondering.

bcfe7032-1a19-44a8-8aa0-3b534cd51416-0
01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:41.570
What's happening?

b386e699-8f6b-4949-8171-d6855b28f5b7-0
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:47.060
And and the king has a throne
there with three chairs.

f52e2595-1b02-409c-a130-78ba1a35e40f-0
01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.520
And that is that the next page.

714b49a0-7d32-4be3-aa26-59af7e0d8ad7-0
01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:00.030
So as the king was greeting the.

254f33a3-6e89-4a3d-b5b8-255fc158a450-0
01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.430
The father and the children.

923c00ad-49e6-47e8-aa03-ef8f81e5663d-0
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:09.006
And the bird, the purple bird.
They now realize that the

923c00ad-49e6-47e8-aa03-ef8f81e5663d-1
01:31:09.006 --> 01:31:15.116
soldiers who were chasing them
have also appeared, and one of

923c00ad-49e6-47e8-aa03-ef8f81e5663d-2
01:31:15.116 --> 01:31:18.270
them, the one in the gold armor.

6b07b55b-3d9a-46a4-892c-b0f65bd02565-0
01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:24.117
Has arrived and is just about to
get off of the boat and come up

6b07b55b-3d9a-46a4-892c-b0f65bd02565-1
01:31:24.117 --> 01:31:25.970
the steps to chase them.

04009a21-a3b6-42af-a0cc-23b2860cb934-0
01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:30.989
And the king has his arm.
They're all facing the dock area

04009a21-a3b6-42af-a0cc-23b2860cb934-1
01:31:30.989 --> 01:31:35.290
from the top of the steps. The
father, the little girl, the

04009a21-a3b6-42af-a0cc-23b2860cb934-2
01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:39.519
little boy, and the king. The
king has this arm around the

04009a21-a3b6-42af-a0cc-23b2860cb934-3
01:31:39.519 --> 01:31:42.099
little boy, who's holding a
purple.

548579e5-3d99-49eb-8c82-42c89e38b08b-0
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:47.798
Crayon his hand and the little
girl has a red crayon in her

548579e5-3d99-49eb-8c82-42c89e38b08b-1
01:31:47.798 --> 01:31:52.985
hand. And the father. They all
look like they're about to run

548579e5-3d99-49eb-8c82-42c89e38b08b-2
01:31:52.985 --> 01:31:54.240
away from this.

c108ffa1-2c6f-40eb-89a9-4ebad8de5580-0
01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:58.650
Soldier who is chasing them? the
next page.

660a21b0-829f-4024-aede-abdf9e20242f-0
01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:04.925
It's now night time in the city,
and the next page shows that not

660a21b0-829f-4024-aede-abdf9e20242f-1
01:32:04.925 --> 01:32:09.945
only is the man in the gold
armor chasing them, but all of

660a21b0-829f-4024-aede-abdf9e20242f-2
01:32:09.945 --> 01:32:14.965
his soldiers have also arrived
and are on the boat heading

660a21b0-829f-4024-aede-abdf9e20242f-3
01:32:14.965 --> 01:32:19.900
leading up, running up the steps
to take the king and the

660a21b0-829f-4024-aede-abdf9e20242f-4
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:25.260
children and the man. But the
king is raising his hand. He has

660a21b0-829f-4024-aede-abdf9e20242f-5
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:29.430
something gold in his hand and
on the next page.

79ef46c8-0352-4afc-9e3a-9f806dd70929-0
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:37.990
Next page.

14199fd5-e1b2-47eb-853f-106f10b6422f-0
01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:42.400
We see that.

8a8f12c9-45aa-44e5-b0aa-d9a8502f627e-0
01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:49.840
The king threatens the soldiers
with this gold.

6f506f20-13f2-48bf-8f8a-0be571107f80-0
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:55.579
Crayon or gold thing, he's
drawing something and the

6f506f20-13f2-48bf-8f8a-0be571107f80-1
01:32:55.579 --> 01:33:00.038
children and the father in the
background watching him with

6f506f20-13f2-48bf-8f8a-0be571107f80-2
01:33:00.038 --> 01:33:04.423
concern as to what is happening.
And the soldiers are also

6f506f20-13f2-48bf-8f8a-0be571107f80-3
01:33:04.423 --> 01:33:08.734
standing at the bottom of the
steps, staring up to at the

6f506f20-13f2-48bf-8f8a-0be571107f80-4
01:33:08.734 --> 01:33:13.491
king, wondering what he's doing
with this gold crayon or pen in

6f506f20-13f2-48bf-8f8a-0be571107f80-5
01:33:13.491 --> 01:33:14.160
his hand.

d0e0f833-e8f5-478b-b99b-8c9129da4d25-0
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.976
And the man, the the gold man,
the Gold Soldier has something

d0e0f833-e8f5-478b-b99b-8c9129da4d25-1
01:33:19.976 --> 01:33:24.124
in his hand. It's not the cage
this time, but it's something

d0e0f833-e8f5-478b-b99b-8c9129da4d25-2
01:33:24.124 --> 01:33:27.932
that has a handle, like
something that maybe makes some

d0e0f833-e8f5-478b-b99b-8c9129da4d25-3
01:33:27.932 --> 01:33:28.340
noise.

ece7180e-c9fc-4f39-ba9f-e68aa1fc7bb3-0
01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:33.300
Anyway, in the next page is a
white page with three scenes.

37421c4f-05bc-40f8-9a5f-4da49b8bac7f-0
01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:40.579
The scene the first scene is
with the King has drawn a golden

37421c4f-05bc-40f8-9a5f-4da49b8bac7f-1
01:33:40.579 --> 01:33:45.510
sword and he threatens the the
the soldier with it.

5fb0e646-4b74-4cbb-ba50-aec2d223c44a-0
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:53.570
But in the second picture on the
page on the white page.

4b9db5b7-e24e-412c-946c-259ed1031002-0
01:33:54.650 --> 01:33:58.640
Something is flying
out-of-the-box that the, the,

4b9db5b7-e24e-412c-946c-259ed1031002-1
01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:58.960
the.

f1ff3d51-2d93-4c18-9f2b-d80c2c0139a5-0
01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:04.480
Soldier with the gold clothes
has on and it's.

f6860e39-2ce8-4d28-958c-8a50b11b1038-0
01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:13.938
It looks like it has taken the
sword as such. Maybe it's like a

f6860e39-2ce8-4d28-958c-8a50b11b1038-1
01:34:13.938 --> 01:34:19.518
vacuum that sucks the the
crayons out of the hands of the

f6860e39-2ce8-4d28-958c-8a50b11b1038-2
01:34:19.518 --> 01:34:23.560
king and out of his sash and
renders him.

682a2e1d-aa76-4e0b-8186-31be47f05345-0
01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:25.190
Harmless.

9a163035-b1fd-4990-b8a0-a236d39e0e77-0
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:31.516
And the the Gold Soldier tells
his soldiers to take the king

9a163035-b1fd-4990-b8a0-a236d39e0e77-1
01:34:31.516 --> 01:34:32.520
once again.

cdc5f0e3-3055-41df-a0cc-519bf1954f99-0
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.276
And they take the king down the
steps, and the man with the

cdc5f0e3-3055-41df-a0cc-519bf1954f99-1
01:34:38.276 --> 01:34:38.680
gold.

def7a896-b6b7-4a46-b9cd-b92daccc88de-0
01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:46.132
Hat and armor and the box. The
vacuum box runs off the picture

def7a896-b6b7-4a46-b9cd-b92daccc88de-1
01:34:46.132 --> 01:34:47.750
to the next page.

a75e74ce-c6fe-4ef2-a169-853804f31b2b-0
01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.570
And this is a white page.

e59b9d85-9c38-4671-b7da-e3c47f162ccf-0
01:34:57.550 --> 01:35:02.602
With three characters, 4
characters, you can see the the

e59b9d85-9c38-4671-b7da-e3c47f162ccf-1
01:35:02.602 --> 01:35:08.186
Golden Soldier in the back with
his box in his hand way in the

e59b9d85-9c38-4671-b7da-e3c47f162ccf-2
01:35:08.186 --> 01:35:09.250
in the back.

5bfc41e8-94c8-4fbc-975d-1cd3d159b333-0
01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:14.199
But closer to where you're
sitting is the little girl

5bfc41e8-94c8-4fbc-975d-1cd3d159b333-1
01:35:14.199 --> 01:35:18.612
holding the bird, the purple
bird and her red crayon, and

5bfc41e8-94c8-4fbc-975d-1cd3d159b333-2
01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:23.406
then the father. And then the
son is in the front drawing with

5bfc41e8-94c8-4fbc-975d-1cd3d159b333-3
01:35:23.406 --> 01:35:27.820
his purple crayon, and he's
drawing in wings, right wing.

ddcc4bab-ef8b-4aef-8bb9-94ca372888b0-0
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:33.281
And the little girl and the
father are concerned about what

ddcc4bab-ef8b-4aef-8bb9-94ca372888b0-1
01:35:33.281 --> 01:35:38.012
they're seeing him draw, but
just in the nick of time, the

ddcc4bab-ef8b-4aef-8bb9-94ca372888b0-2
01:35:38.012 --> 01:35:41.300
boy completes his drawing of the
flying.

f2a475d2-3603-41d9-a3d2-bfe10364ea4a-0
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.820
I have no idea the flying lion.

33f1ec52-f3ce-420c-bc6f-566639c14aa4-0
01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:50.720
Or dragon.

64ef75ec-0be3-49a8-ae5e-3ccd2d31bc9c-0
01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:59.705
The Purple Dragon you flies away
across the moon, across the

64ef75ec-0be3-49a8-ae5e-3ccd2d31bc9c-1
01:35:59.705 --> 01:36:07.030
water, away from the man with
the vacuum box, and away from.

6fb1f961-d774-4e74-b933-88a461634a78-0
01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.892
Place where the king was taken
off into the night. They fly,

6fb1f961-d774-4e74-b933-88a461634a78-1
01:36:13.892 --> 01:36:17.370
and all three of them are
sitting on this.

c88372b8-6d80-4ede-bcfc-2b8a3fe7a4a6-0
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:24.140
Lion Dragon watching, looking at
the man with the box who's

c88372b8-6d80-4ede-bcfc-2b8a3fe7a4a6-1
01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:27.620
reaching towards them but cannot
reach them.

b49c8cd9-e4ff-4bbc-bf8e-d20780371af1-0
01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:29.130
Next.

3ddda318-1c58-41c2-a650-268170989721-0
01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.220
But much to their surprise.

6162d774-9d13-4e62-a7fd-99d58c465732-0
01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:45.199
The next page is the picture of
the the Golden King, the Golden

6162d774-9d13-4e62-a7fd-99d58c465732-1
01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:51.853
Soldier who continues to pursue
them. But he has in this box a

6162d774-9d13-4e62-a7fd-99d58c465732-2
01:36:51.853 --> 01:36:58.719
lot of power because the the box
has the power to suck the color

6162d774-9d13-4e62-a7fd-99d58c465732-3
01:36:58.719 --> 01:37:05.056
away from people's lives and
make it dark again, and so the

6162d774-9d13-4e62-a7fd-99d58c465732-4
01:37:05.056 --> 01:37:09.069
the boat that he was in on the
water.

94a4f250-7843-42c6-82fa-6278b4bf70d6-0
01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:13.300
Now can fly through the air, and
it lifts up and follows.

9608ebe9-64d2-4b5f-879d-3919574ffa26-0
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:19.682
The father and the two children,
and it proceeds to stuck the

9608ebe9-64d2-4b5f-879d-3919574ffa26-1
01:37:19.682 --> 01:37:20.050
the.

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-0
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:25.041
Drawings of the the dragon that
the little boy made and also the

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-1
01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:28.901
the purple crayon out of the
little boy's hand and and the

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-2
01:37:28.901 --> 01:37:32.237
the dragon is starting to
dissolve. Is starting to

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-3
01:37:32.237 --> 01:37:35.965
dissolve and the father and the
son and the daughter are

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-4
01:37:35.965 --> 01:37:40.151
frightened. Now they don't know
what's going to happen, because

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-5
01:37:40.151 --> 01:37:44.272
if they lose the dragon they'll
drop into the ocean or or down

e8d27cef-1798-4c93-939a-ca7a8668e4aa-6
01:37:44.272 --> 01:37:44.599
into.

1ece0c94-367d-4e15-86d4-378c394c9416-0
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.680
Into the the castle.

0d820a2f-697b-4dbd-8dcb-b99f358a80ad-0
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.360
Next page.

81a20422-e2fc-4a7c-aa9b-264f597faabc-0
01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:01.844
Which is exactly what happens as
the as the box sucks in the the

81a20422-e2fc-4a7c-aa9b-264f597faabc-1
01:38:01.844 --> 01:38:04.820
Purple Dragon and finishes.

5e2301a2-f7a6-4726-a410-f2ed5cfc7aeb-0
01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.990
Sucking in all of the feathers
from it.

ecab0fd4-68d1-42bf-8b30-6ca6d9224a5c-0
01:38:09.670 --> 01:38:12.030
The the little boy.

8012118c-3062-45c1-85c5-768b6aa1d2a5-0
01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:13.670
Umm.

001cbbaf-0598-4058-a007-084c13a6c467-0
01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.481
Flies through the air and the
king grabs his hand. The King is

001cbbaf-0598-4058-a007-084c13a6c467-1
01:38:19.481 --> 01:38:23.971
also in the boat as a prisoner,
and the king grabs the little

001cbbaf-0598-4058-a007-084c13a6c467-2
01:38:23.971 --> 01:38:27.230
boy's hand to pull him into the
flying boat.

721551d0-25b8-4933-9f11-864c4550ec8d-0
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:32.814
And on the next page, it shows
the father and the little girl

721551d0-25b8-4933-9f11-864c4550ec8d-1
01:38:32.814 --> 01:38:36.993
floating through the air, but it
looks like they're going to fall

721551d0-25b8-4933-9f11-864c4550ec8d-2
01:38:36.993 --> 01:38:40.664
because they weren't able to
grab on to anything. And the

721551d0-25b8-4933-9f11-864c4550ec8d-3
01:38:40.664 --> 01:38:44.779
little girl still has the crayon
in her hand and the bird in her

721551d0-25b8-4933-9f11-864c4550ec8d-4
01:38:44.779 --> 01:38:48.957
arm, the purple bird in her arm,
but her crown is falling off her

721551d0-25b8-4933-9f11-864c4550ec8d-5
01:38:48.957 --> 01:38:51.680
head and the father is very
concerned and.

d7a681e9-0519-4d64-95f1-52ba6cb213ab-0
01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:56.420
Looks very surprised as they're
floating in the air.

4d104276-3ad1-44c9-81d0-5b77dc1c0c14-0
01:38:57.170 --> 01:38:57.780
Next page.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.670
And this is a picture of the
father and the daughter falling.

2dfafbc9-48d3-453a-b167-97135d1eb2d7-0
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:14.370
From the sky and from the the
bird into the water.

9dfafc66-3b38-4345-9fe9-c55cf6b5ebf9-0
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.591
And sinking down into the water
into the under and underwater

9dfafc66-3b38-4345-9fe9-c55cf6b5ebf9-1
01:39:20.591 --> 01:39:25.824
city where the fish are swimming
around and there are underwater

9dfafc66-3b38-4345-9fe9-c55cf6b5ebf9-2
01:39:25.824 --> 01:39:26.710
structures.

9d06362e-40a2-4da9-9535-7762fbd49953-0
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:33.462
The father and the daughter and
the purple bird have fallen, but

9d06362e-40a2-4da9-9535-7762fbd49953-1
01:39:33.462 --> 01:39:38.359
thankfully the little girl was
able to still hold on to her red

9d06362e-40a2-4da9-9535-7762fbd49953-2
01:39:38.359 --> 01:39:42.872
crayon and the next picture
shows it's a white page and it

9d06362e-40a2-4da9-9535-7762fbd49953-3
01:39:42.872 --> 01:39:44.250
shows her drawing.

27c9b4c8-4b59-479c-89b7-cbad34415f8b-0
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:49.670
Red outline that looks kind of
like a A.

157efe5c-34f6-4723-a03d-309f3cfb3219-0
01:39:50.650 --> 01:39:56.537
It could possibly be a submarine
type vessel, but she's enclosed

157efe5c-34f6-4723-a03d-309f3cfb3219-1
01:39:56.537 --> 01:39:56.900
her.

ead85d66-fe0a-47e3-9760-4087b0442149-0
01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:03.640
And the bird, the purple bird,
and her father within the lines

ead85d66-fe0a-47e3-9760-4087b0442149-1
01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.520
of this of this red.

870a74e5-87d7-455a-a4b4-2803bb699761-0
01:40:07.130 --> 01:40:08.710
Drawing next page.

0961b5db-3b29-49f9-8577-053e3f18ddda-0
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.245
And this page we see a scene of
the of an underground life and

0961b5db-3b29-49f9-8577-053e3f18ddda-1
01:40:19.245 --> 01:40:25.293
the colors it's green and and
blue water and yellow sea life

0961b5db-3b29-49f9-8577-053e3f18ddda-2
01:40:25.293 --> 01:40:25.690
and.

b94238f6-e530-4fda-bd9d-e72829f42803-0
01:40:27.670 --> 01:40:29.440
Corals and ends.

596d6102-60d6-4311-ae96-db6e90d672ff-0
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:38.043
Plants and on the next page we
see the under and underground

596d6102-60d6-4311-ae96-db6e90d672ff-1
01:40:38.043 --> 01:40:39.610
view of the the.

f14e3206-af63-440e-9c8e-b16be5cfcce6-0
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.375
Submarine that the little girl
had grown and in the submarine

f14e3206-af63-440e-9c8e-b16be5cfcce6-1
01:40:44.375 --> 01:40:48.370
you can see the the sides of the
submarine have been removed.

1e2f6767-c9f7-4917-b9d9-07238c46b16a-0
01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.198
Have been cut away so that we
can see what's going on in the

1e2f6767-c9f7-4917-b9d9-07238c46b16a-1
01:40:52.198 --> 01:40:52.690
submarine.

09e00cf2-058a-4ba1-b399-4a07ac9817bd-0
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:57.581
And submarine, there are three
compartments. The father

09e00cf2-058a-4ba1-b399-4a07ac9817bd-1
01:40:57.581 --> 01:41:02.221
inhabits the first compartments
and he's sitting down looking

09e00cf2-058a-4ba1-b399-4a07ac9817bd-2
01:41:02.221 --> 01:41:06.787
out the window and the little
girl is in the top compartment

09e00cf2-058a-4ba1-b399-4a07ac9817bd-3
01:41:06.787 --> 01:41:10.530
where she controls the the
telescope and can see.

9d42953e-db01-4a42-8dcd-e0deea64b9cf-0
01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:16.513
Up and outside of the water she
can see along the surface of the

9d42953e-db01-4a42-8dcd-e0deea64b9cf-1
01:41:16.513 --> 01:41:20.700
water and in the front of the
submarine is the bird.

aed4d90f-5ee1-4e56-b400-281809659c82-0
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.870
Who is?

b353738f-3f9d-4a6b-acf3-29be958e6904-0
01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.950
Excuse me, sitting there.

d6840ece-2367-48a1-bd47-959f247014f9-0
01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.050
And the submarine has bubbles.

4908d27e-5769-445b-845f-05ba1399c278-0
01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:33.122
Towards the back so it looks
like the propeller is on and

4908d27e-5769-445b-845f-05ba1399c278-1
01:41:33.122 --> 01:41:35.370
it's making its way through the
sea.

a2a2cd1f-d035-44fb-b65e-2fcd08097abb-0
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:36.730
Next page.

860af179-2304-4015-93a7-df6e1ffb62fc-0
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:46.521
And as the as the submarine made
its way through the sea, it came

860af179-2304-4015-93a7-df6e1ffb62fc-1
01:41:46.521 --> 01:41:47.740
to a landing place.

7613dc74-bd24-476c-a4b8-175f77159f9e-0
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:54.748
Which was the entrance to a
cave. And so they decided to

7613dc74-bd24-476c-a4b8-175f77159f9e-1
01:41:54.748 --> 01:41:59.983
stop and take a rest and climb
out of the climb out of the

7613dc74-bd24-476c-a4b8-175f77159f9e-2
01:41:59.983 --> 01:42:02.380
submarine through a little.

ff21a324-63d5-4a4b-9af5-17f1412c14b4-0
01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:06.430
Hole off a little hatchway.

bd3ceffe-091b-4618-b341-9334b2309650-0
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:11.530
And the the little girl and her
father and purple bird.

90880fd2-fcbe-40fc-b446-6731f3c4eda7-0
01:42:12.330 --> 01:42:16.865
Have come out of the submarine
and they see in the air what

90880fd2-fcbe-40fc-b446-6731f3c4eda7-1
01:42:16.865 --> 01:42:21.325
looks to be people floating
around, but they're not really

90880fd2-fcbe-40fc-b446-6731f3c4eda7-2
01:42:21.325 --> 01:42:25.936
quite sure. There may be some
fish there and people and some

90880fd2-fcbe-40fc-b446-6731f3c4eda7-3
01:42:25.936 --> 01:42:26.390
boats.

5622271e-d3f3-406d-9482-6f032ace8aae-0
01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:30.200
But they're all floating in the
air outside of this cave.

1768d3f3-4280-47d5-92fa-ec53860d93a6-0
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:32.410
And.

bcebd7df-4ac7-4a6b-983c-13507589bd94-0
01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:37.410
The camera moves.

f3a3095a-98ee-45f5-b3a1-c0c5e0c7d072-0
01:42:39.610 --> 01:42:43.479
The camera moves into a more
detailed shot closer into The

f3a3095a-98ee-45f5-b3a1-c0c5e0c7d072-1
01:42:43.479 --> 01:42:47.677
Cave and it it shows more people
and more boats floating in the

f3a3095a-98ee-45f5-b3a1-c0c5e0c7d072-2
01:42:47.677 --> 01:42:47.940
air.

655b7e0c-85d4-4163-a78f-ddb57d226233-0
01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.710
And and so.

822d75e3-becf-4dcb-adef-1de3129f6df4-0
01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:52.970
Uh.

29c9ec4c-40d6-4880-883c-9335ed84c093-0
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.790
We see that it's becoming a big
room next page.

8193ef5a-6295-4f7c-aa4a-b18eb8b03612-0
01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:06.124
So they leave the submarine, and
the father and the daughter and

8193ef5a-6295-4f7c-aa4a-b18eb8b03612-1
01:43:06.124 --> 01:43:10.403
the bird walk into The Cave and
they they're the little girl is

8193ef5a-6295-4f7c-aa4a-b18eb8b03612-2
01:43:10.403 --> 01:43:11.740
pointing to all the.

2d936c8e-75a4-41eb-aeff-0bd877aae2db-0
01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:13.410
Umm.

8132568a-ccb2-429a-ac32-91446b7f6282-0
01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:18.808
Ah, it seems like they're maybe
not floating in The Cave, but

8132568a-ccb2-429a-ac32-91446b7f6282-1
01:43:18.808 --> 01:43:22.090
more than they are cave drawings
on the walls.

fde54f86-c7c5-4a03-9507-e4d5113abd56-0
01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:26.300
They look like they were drawn
by the Kingsman.

2d19a0a0-11f3-4b5c-86ab-eb7f5bc78a9f-0
01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:31.130
Thousands of years ago, and the
little girl was pointing to

2d19a0a0-11f3-4b5c-86ab-eb7f5bc78a9f-1
01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:35.198
these drawings on the wall of
The Cave. Somehow they are lit

2d19a0a0-11f3-4b5c-86ab-eb7f5bc78a9f-2
01:43:35.198 --> 01:43:39.332
up. We're not sure why, except
maybe because of the sun. It's

2d19a0a0-11f3-4b5c-86ab-eb7f5bc78a9f-3
01:43:39.332 --> 01:43:41.200
the sun starting to come up.

a1e979e9-2b6f-4b9e-a266-0e61504456c8-0
01:43:42.090 --> 01:43:46.987
Also in this picture, there's a
little door underneath a mantle

a1e979e9-2b6f-4b9e-a266-0e61504456c8-1
01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:49.590
of rock. It's a little Gray
door.

c8492eb1-cf9c-49f0-bb3b-b16534e9aa90-0
01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.990
In the next picture there is.

b89428b8-f4f9-47db-95f0-0b40cd3d48d8-0
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:55.050
Just a view.

b8df189e-9f5f-462b-9e57-743838822501-0
01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:58.020
From inside The Cave, looking
out.

9ec11f1e-46ec-4ee4-a9a0-1cfa07b92cc5-0
01:43:59.670 --> 01:44:01.570
But danger lurks because.

30d5327d-c8bd-478e-9c83-09ae3808d113-0
01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:08.930
The shadow of the boat of the
soldiers is.

00db82ea-e245-4737-82c1-8321426e314c-0
01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:12.420
Is.

eae1338e-8dc6-451e-a64c-ac132660ab24-0
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:18.850
Showing on the wall eyes are
glowing and.

7d5fce2c-1b4e-4561-9dcb-0426e2777190-0
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:23.843
The father and the daughter do
not see it yet, but is

7d5fce2c-1b4e-4561-9dcb-0426e2777190-1
01:44:23.843 --> 01:44:25.280
approaching The Cave.

7e347feb-7009-4e68-bb80-8b9ceb0e6b2a-0
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:28.470
Anyway, next page.

f63a4358-495b-45af-9e3f-f82981db4e61-0
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.370
So.

5d99b27e-cd35-4f97-9116-9ae1ce245233-0
01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:44.186
As they as they suddenly realize
that the the boat has arrived

5d99b27e-cd35-4f97-9116-9ae1ce245233-1
01:44:44.186 --> 01:44:50.350
and they're hiding behind a big
pillar in The Cave.

c1ded611-a9a0-41b9-b058-5a45ccd605e4-0
01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.460
And they're looking up.

7b8dd30e-e69e-4f73-b0b3-646359d1413f-0
01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:57.394
At the the father's looking up
at the drawings still, but the

7b8dd30e-e69e-4f73-b0b3-646359d1413f-1
01:44:57.394 --> 01:44:59.400
little girl and the birds see.

01c2c19f-5628-4bbb-a585-70314ef0bdb2-0
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:04.153
The the the Gold Knight and his
boat, and the king and the

01c2c19f-5628-4bbb-a585-70314ef0bdb2-1
01:45:04.153 --> 01:45:07.910
knights that are holding him and
the brother hostage.

2c4f5114-2f0c-4e82-9c91-b9f1d8eec6eb-0
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.361
But they decide to try to
escape. And so the father takes

2c4f5114-2f0c-4e82-9c91-b9f1d8eec6eb-1
01:45:13.361 --> 01:45:17.948
the little girl's purple crayon.
And on the next page it's a

2c4f5114-2f0c-4e82-9c91-b9f1d8eec6eb-2
01:45:17.948 --> 01:45:22.761
white page and there are three
scenes. The first scene he takes

2c4f5114-2f0c-4e82-9c91-b9f1d8eec6eb-3
01:45:22.761 --> 01:45:27.423
the crayon. In the middle scene,
the little bird lands on the

2c4f5114-2f0c-4e82-9c91-b9f1d8eec6eb-4
01:45:27.423 --> 01:45:31.860
girl's shoulder and the father
takes the crayon and draws.

1a492711-0d12-4a74-914c-dbc03c490063-0
01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.170
A.

9689ab17-8825-4368-88a1-ddfd50592cb6-0
01:45:35.110 --> 01:45:35.620
Umm.

4ffa51c7-be71-452c-b07c-b0a6c9326645-0
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:41.052
It looks like he's drawing a
door, but it's actually a place

4ffa51c7-be71-452c-b07c-b0a6c9326645-1
01:45:41.052 --> 01:45:44.260
for the little bird to sit like
a bird house.

a34e6b45-8447-439a-911e-c8b07658b9f6-0
01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.860
And they they put the little
bird in this house.

ba76d3f4-8295-4e22-9f9b-cbc2d0a26ac2-0
01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:55.433
And the father is on his knees
finishing up the drawing, and

ba76d3f4-8295-4e22-9f9b-cbc2d0a26ac2-1
01:45:55.433 --> 01:45:59.287
the little girl is looking at
him with her hand on her head.

ba76d3f4-8295-4e22-9f9b-cbc2d0a26ac2-2
01:45:59.287 --> 01:46:01.120
Kind of perplexed. Next page.

5bdb61fe-1882-4fb1-992d-18032687b2a2-0
01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.540
And as the little bird is
sitting on his new little cage.

b2facbf5-fb0a-4fd2-8c0a-6af2fbe96c8f-0
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.730
The the soldier with the vacuum
machine.

01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:23.540
Runs toward the bird and sucks
it into his machine while the

1610141f-5a68-47de-a676-9377edbb7df5-1
01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:25.480

01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:27.810
Umm.

01:46:28.610 --> 01:46:29.190
Oh.

01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:35.580
But the next page shows that it
was a trap because the.

48a5e83e-e5e3-431b-acb2-e8fc3df1f05c-0
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.980
Umm.

01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:43.209
The bird is sucked into the
machine, but the father drew a

8fcd74a6-f3fb-48f8-96d2-aa6e7b4787e3-1
01:46:43.209 --> 01:46:48.231
trap. So when the man when the
knight ran up the ramp into this

8fcd74a6-f3fb-48f8-96d2-aa6e7b4787e3-2
01:46:48.231 --> 01:46:50.900
little cage that the bird was
in.

c5bd1d17-460c-4f66-a06e-fa5d5cce9703-0
01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:58.268
The the doors, the wooden doors
of the the wooden sides of the

c5bd1d17-460c-4f66-a06e-fa5d5cce9703-1
01:46:58.268 --> 01:47:00.230
cage quickly raise up.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:06.210
And capture the the Golden
Knight.

7b7c36bd-802f-436f-9289-2c1838d2ccf0-0
01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:12.496
And the the vacuum box flies out
of his hand and into the

7b7c36bd-802f-436f-9289-2c1838d2ccf0-1
01:47:12.496 --> 01:47:17.723
father's hands. And the little
girl. So now the knight is stuck

7b7c36bd-802f-436f-9289-2c1838d2ccf0-2
01:47:17.723 --> 01:47:22.868
in the the cage, the bird cage.
And the father has his machine

7b7c36bd-802f-436f-9289-2c1838d2ccf0-3
01:47:22.868 --> 01:47:27.850
and the little girl. They're
both standing out. And a couple

7b7c36bd-802f-436f-9289-2c1838d2ccf0-4
01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:31.606

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:41.658
And the father raises the box
over his head and smashes it

f970f7ba-70bc-460e-8694-023d7b62ab32-1
01:47:41.658 --> 01:47:45.842
onto a rock in The Cave, and
colors fly everywhere. The

01:47:45.842 --> 01:47:50.549

The Cave and the bird escapes.

01:47:50.549 --> 01:47:55.256
And all of the different things
that have been sucked into the

f970f7ba-70bc-460e-8694-023d7b62ab32-4

decided to stay back and and and

The end of the kite sticking out

flying above the city and
heading towards the house where

01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:31.390
This scene is called fun and

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:36.100

A Colosseum type structure

The gladiators to the Lions and
have battles, and but the Lions

01:51:57.703 --> 01:52:03.150
have all escaped, and the horses
have escaped they were going to

leopards and horses and lions

01:52:20.698 --> 01:52:25.894
are people just in togas, and
there are gladiators, and there

b7eb2d1a-c81f-4374-b96b-f867d234af13-4
01:52:25.894 --> 01:52:26.229

01:52:30.150 --> 01:52:35.245
I forget what those are called.
The the teams of horses that

01:52:35.245 --> 01:52:40.258

fights and feed the Christians

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:53.587
But everything's happening at
once here. And so the gladiators

3455d4d2-35a0-48ff-8bf0-a400b627c682-1
01:52:53.587 --> 01:52:58.164
are riding their horses. But
then the horses are riding, the

3455d4d2-35a0-48ff-8bf0-a400b627c682-2
01:52:58.164 --> 01:53:02.367
Chariots are in the Chariots,

01:53:02.367 --> 01:53:06.869
soldiers are pulling the horses
in the Chariots. And in one

3455d4d2-35a0-48ff-8bf0-a400b627c682-4
01:53:06.869 --> 01:53:11.371

02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:08.900
hand and he's standing looking
at one of the houses.

404bb7fd-e3ab-4377-ba50-1206804e51bf-0
02:01:10.190 --> 02:01:15.573
On the next page is his sister,
who's sitting out on the steps

404bb7fd-e3ab-4377-ba50-1206804e51bf-1
02:01:15.573 --> 02:01:20.957
of the house. The the sidewalk
steps and she's got her chin on

404bb7fd-e3ab-4377-ba50-1206804e51bf-2
02:01:20.957 --> 02:01:26.256
her knees, her knees tucked up
underneath her chin, and she's

404bb7fd-e3ab-4377-ba50-1206804e51bf-3
02:01:26.256 --> 02:01:27.879
staring at her red.

ee371df3-001e-4d27-a46d-2b4eae89b875-0
02:01:28.610 --> 02:01:29.300
Scooter.

201d97f3-6d44-4a20-b596-6aed446dfefe-0
02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:32.160
And.

6cb4f734-a857-49b3-bb74-c3265e066a93-0
02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.753
We see the same, a little bit of
a different scene of a different

6cb4f734-a857-49b3-bb74-c3265e066a93-1
02:01:37.753 --> 02:01:38.200
house.

81723cd2-8cd8-4041-bbb2-edaa608dc542-0
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:44.694
The the entryway is the same and
the kitchen is the same but the

81723cd2-8cd8-4041-bbb2-edaa608dc542-1
02:01:44.694 --> 02:01:45.030
the.

5c1fccfa-ef56-4119-ac9a-a70eee31e1a2-0
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:48.290
The second floor is a little bit
different.

67b61302-47ff-44c7-b831-cc151b90c9d1-0
02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:53.350
There's a father up there, but
he's changed his.

f770e1ee-df9c-4ed8-8987-b42ab2a67730-0
02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:59.675
Office around it looks to be a
little more modern he now rather

f770e1ee-df9c-4ed8-8987-b42ab2a67730-1
02:01:59.675 --> 02:02:03.911
than having an architectural
table, engineering table that

f770e1ee-df9c-4ed8-8987-b42ab2a67730-2
02:02:03.911 --> 02:02:04.270
that.

2dc5af66-6653-4668-b049-cabca57c4534-0
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.937
Stands up, he has a a regular
desk that has a computer on it,

2dc5af66-6653-4668-b049-cabca57c4534-1
02:02:10.937 --> 02:02:12.450
and he seems to be.

ddd9e743-d160-4013-8718-b9470d79b88e-0
02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:18.282
Working on his computer and in
the next room, the door next to

ddd9e743-d160-4013-8718-b9470d79b88e-1
02:02:18.282 --> 02:02:19.890
the room next to him.

40a3038e-0b44-4532-aeae-cc093f1a80da-0
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:25.220
There's someone laying on the
couch looking at her.

2d4a84bd-de6b-403e-b6fb-0592ab841946-0
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:29.890
Phone looking at something on
her phone on her screen.

14954514-398c-4386-aa43-7073521ff0ad-0
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:35.349
And on the 1st floor, the mother
is in the kitchen cooking

14954514-398c-4386-aa43-7073521ff0ad-1
02:02:35.349 --> 02:02:35.890
dinner.

4dd004fc-9683-4364-9e36-d0b5f745fde1-0
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.746
And and then the other little
girl sitting outside on the

4dd004fc-9683-4364-9e36-d0b5f745fde1-1
02:02:40.746 --> 02:02:42.920
stump looking at a red scooter.

e42be10d-1212-445c-bf38-4e6a6de8bc4e-0
02:02:43.650 --> 02:02:44.050
OK.

82d7fdde-a91c-4498-9180-2faecd58fe77-0
02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:50.370
The next page is a white page
with three different scenes.

3c146f07-2176-4c3a-bd23-8b81c621b6eb-0
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:55.605
The little girl who was outside
with her scooter is now in the

3c146f07-2176-4c3a-bd23-8b81c621b6eb-1
02:02:55.605 --> 02:02:59.358
kitchen with her mom, who's
talking on the phone. It is a

3c146f07-2176-4c3a-bd23-8b81c621b6eb-2
02:02:59.358 --> 02:03:03.175
landline phone. It has a long
cord and her mother stirring

3c146f07-2176-4c3a-bd23-8b81c621b6eb-3
02:03:03.175 --> 02:03:06.992
something on the stove, and the
little girl was looking at

3c146f07-2176-4c3a-bd23-8b81c621b6eb-4
02:03:06.992 --> 02:03:08.609
something on the counter.

7364d0a9-7d23-4283-a394-a8f2b7097709-0
02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:10.050
In the.

2a7dc7f5-293a-475e-9f2e-aca1ed9c46e2-0
02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:16.375
Scene the next scene? The little
girl is in her father's office,

2a7dc7f5-293a-475e-9f2e-aca1ed9c46e2-1
02:03:16.375 --> 02:03:21.476
looking over his chair and over
his shoulder at the computer

2a7dc7f5-293a-475e-9f2e-aca1ed9c46e2-2
02:03:21.476 --> 02:03:25.490
screen, and she now has a red
kite in her hand.

8d554f8f-e053-4a7e-8bbe-c91c41a5b508-0
02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:32.189
And then on the bottom scene,
she is sitting with what looks

8d554f8f-e053-4a7e-8bbe-c91c41a5b508-1
02:03:32.189 --> 02:03:37.353
to be another girl on the couch
who is still looking at her

8d554f8f-e053-4a7e-8bbe-c91c41a5b508-2
02:03:37.353 --> 02:03:37.870
phone.

f48290f6-ad71-4bc2-9616-4a29d8df1601-0
02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:41.810
And this time, the little girl
has the red ball in her hand.

323b1a1a-74ea-4208-9f9b-8c11ae388a19-0
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:47.920
In each of these scenes, the
person who she's trying to.

13db89f5-2a17-4df4-9905-9fbab651da02-0
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:52.842
Get their attention is ignoring
her. Her mother's on the phone

13db89f5-2a17-4df4-9905-9fbab651da02-1
02:03:52.842 --> 02:03:56.350
or father's on the computer and
her older sister is on a phone.

e4d00ce6-827c-45f2-8b5e-4f4aab521d8f-0
02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:03.472
And so the next picture is of
the little girl in her room.

e4d00ce6-827c-45f2-8b5e-4f4aab521d8f-1
02:04:03.472 --> 02:04:08.476
She's gone to her room, and it's
the same room where her little

e4d00ce6-827c-45f2-8b5e-4f4aab521d8f-2
02:04:08.476 --> 02:04:13.558
bed is against the wall. There's
a map above her bed on the wall

e4d00ce6-827c-45f2-8b5e-4f4aab521d8f-3
02:04:13.558 --> 02:04:18.014
with a little lamp that or
little light hanging from the

e4d00ce6-827c-45f2-8b5e-4f4aab521d8f-4
02:04:18.014 --> 02:04:22.940
ceiling that's actually a hot
air balloon and a window looking

e4d00ce6-827c-45f2-8b5e-4f4aab521d8f-5
02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:27.240
out into the city and a cat on
the floor taking a nap.

4aea316a-638b-457c-94d7-2025be860036-0
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:31.865
And her dresser drawer dresser
drawers with a little lamp on

4aea316a-638b-457c-94d7-2025be860036-1
02:04:31.865 --> 02:04:32.080
it.

0d7d811c-1ab3-413d-9c88-f3bdd8549d80-0
02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.680
And a garbage can next to it
next page.

bc65d5fd-10d8-4a9b-b79f-be9e23d1c27f-0
02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:43.342
So she was sitting on her bed
and then she noticed that the

bc65d5fd-10d8-4a9b-b79f-be9e23d1c27f-1
02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:43.610
cat.

fa4b41a9-2433-4ac9-8cb0-cf8730757bd9-0
02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.370
Who is now walking out of the
door of her room.

5ef6e099-f23e-4268-a78a-0ef28f8b681f-0
02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:52.632
Was sitting on a red crayon and
some papers, and as the cat gets

5ef6e099-f23e-4268-a78a-0ef28f8b681f-1
02:04:52.632 --> 02:04:55.650
up to leave, she notices the red
crayon there.

975517d6-1997-4ae3-b52b-5770f1631c26-0
02:04:56.290 --> 02:05:00.734
And on the next page it's a
white page with three scenes and

975517d6-1997-4ae3-b52b-5770f1631c26-1
02:05:00.734 --> 02:05:05.470
the first scene she picks up the
crayon and looks at the papers.

2f23e623-cc55-477c-978d-6e8b51296298-0
02:05:06.690 --> 02:05:12.044
But in the next scene she is
drawing a an arch on the wall

2f23e623-cc55-477c-978d-6e8b51296298-1
02:05:12.044 --> 02:05:17.852
and it looks like she's going to
draw a a door in the wall. And

2f23e623-cc55-477c-978d-6e8b51296298-2
02:05:17.852 --> 02:05:22.481
in the third scene she's
completed the door and is

2f23e623-cc55-477c-978d-6e8b51296298-3
02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:24.750
halfway through the door.

697e0b25-7305-46de-a31b-685d593e7cb3-0
02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:29.000
Running to another world.

7609c066-511a-4f66-80d6-bbf1cb197727-0
02:05:30.010 --> 02:05:30.800
From her room.

65354f6a-d86a-4e45-a86e-3ad918c53895-0
02:05:32.890 --> 02:05:33.400
Next page.

878cc5a1-c89a-482d-b1a6-f092d1b9c108-0
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:39.780
And she enters the forest again.

b051a5af-4db3-4e5b-be5d-9bf361ab7c33-0
02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:44.730
This time it's a little bit
different. The the.

95e17049-5a4c-4051-b3f7-922948073ab4-0
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.963
The lanterns are blue, although
the lights are still hung and

95e17049-5a4c-4051-b3f7-922948073ab4-1
02:05:49.963 --> 02:05:53.991
draped throughout the forest.
The lanterns are blue and it's a

95e17049-5a4c-4051-b3f7-922948073ab4-2
02:05:53.991 --> 02:05:55.270
little bit brighter.

be7643bd-32a6-4fa9-96b9-c8b981ed9dc7-0
02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:01.069
But the river still there and in
the distance down the winding

be7643bd-32a6-4fa9-96b9-c8b981ed9dc7-1
02:06:01.069 --> 02:06:06.212
river that's winding through the
trees is a is something floating

be7643bd-32a6-4fa9-96b9-c8b981ed9dc7-2
02:06:06.212 --> 02:06:11.277
along the river. And the little
girl still standing at the door,

be7643bd-32a6-4fa9-96b9-c8b981ed9dc7-3
02:06:11.277 --> 02:06:16.264
the light of her room is coming
through, you can see, but she's

be7643bd-32a6-4fa9-96b9-c8b981ed9dc7-4
02:06:16.264 --> 02:06:20.940
walked through into this new
world of the forest next page.

23d72ad2-68bc-42ce-aa2e-3c4a0d0a5a76-0
02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:31.265
And she, like her father, made
her, makes her way across the

23d72ad2-68bc-42ce-aa2e-3c4a0d0a5a76-1
02:06:31.265 --> 02:06:35.949
river into onto the the dock
that was standing there. And

23d72ad2-68bc-42ce-aa2e-3c4a0d0a5a76-2
02:06:35.949 --> 02:06:38.130
she's standing on the dock.

f656dc61-fca5-4e6c-823d-36e18a02e37d-0
02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:45.293
Looking into the water and you
can see a reflection of her self

f656dc61-fca5-4e6c-823d-36e18a02e37d-1
02:06:45.293 --> 02:06:50.387
and her red crayon in the water
as she stands at the end of the

f656dc61-fca5-4e6c-823d-36e18a02e37d-2
02:06:50.387 --> 02:06:51.819
dock looking down.

07d21b45-4511-43ed-ae32-fb50204e7429-0
02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:53.950
On the next page.

99f65a13-533b-4ca4-bd99-73c125f52b7c-0
02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:57.300
There are. It's a white page
with three scenes.

ac8c3cda-7302-4a70-9061-1db1dd025061-0
02:06:58.250 --> 02:07:02.572
And she gets down on her knees
on the dock and reaches into the

ac8c3cda-7302-4a70-9061-1db1dd025061-1
02:07:02.572 --> 02:07:06.489
water and takes her crayon and
begins to draw. And in the

ac8c3cda-7302-4a70-9061-1db1dd025061-2
02:07:06.489 --> 02:07:10.676
second scene we see that looks
like she's drawing a boat. And

ac8c3cda-7302-4a70-9061-1db1dd025061-3
02:07:10.676 --> 02:07:14.660
then the third scene she has
finished drawing the boat and

ac8c3cda-7302-4a70-9061-1db1dd025061-4
02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:18.240
colored it red and has climbed
into the boat and is.

f5a8820e-22ef-42c8-85bc-c8625ae28b2b-0
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:23.720
Sailing away in her boat next
page.

92d83a96-bc36-4880-94ab-3305c3466768-0
02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:32.054
On this page it shows that her
little boat and she are floating

92d83a96-bc36-4880-94ab-3305c3466768-1
02:07:32.054 --> 02:07:32.480
down.

ca6886e8-68d2-4385-9919-b8f2a8979d68-0
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:35.770
The small stream.

91e205fe-cb2c-4d35-adbc-008a32f029c4-0
02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:38.490
Into the entrance.

b5e40cc6-ecbb-490a-8e0c-d234e7f54306-0
02:07:40.230 --> 02:07:44.553
And a large city. And at this
entrance is a wood or wooden

b5e40cc6-ecbb-490a-8e0c-d234e7f54306-1
02:07:44.553 --> 02:07:49.096
doors that are opening as her
little boat is coming and she's

b5e40cc6-ecbb-490a-8e0c-d234e7f54306-2
02:07:49.096 --> 02:07:52.760
leaving the forest of lanterns
for this big city.

2e875218-8545-4f25-9ca3-44a5ff704f6a-0
02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:58.335
And up on the ramparts of the
towers of the city, there are

2e875218-8545-4f25-9ca3-44a5ff704f6a-1
02:07:58.335 --> 02:08:03.495
soldiers there watching her, her
little boat float towards the

2e875218-8545-4f25-9ca3-44a5ff704f6a-2
02:08:03.495 --> 02:08:07.510
moats and the the the bridge
that her boat will.

ae0efdff-6e93-4319-8f16-43f10b4ac531-0
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:10.920
Will float into.

61c77143-95a9-4453-9ae2-8c6b99593176-0
02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:14.290
And on the next page it's just
a.

3986609d-8f92-47d6-84db-2dc5f7f6bfce-0
02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:18.080
Full of pictures of the city.

83e7c49e-b36a-4260-b557-c8046860f081-0
02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:20.250
And.

95186be3-a0bc-4475-b6a3-69a06274415e-0
02:08:21.590 --> 02:08:25.440
City is has many floating.

45f5465c-0029-4bb6-9b40-9aba9f9fffb6-0
02:08:27.170 --> 02:08:31.311
Waterways running through it.
Lots of fountains that are

45f5465c-0029-4bb6-9b40-9aba9f9fffb6-1
02:08:31.311 --> 02:08:35.670
feeding these waterways where
boats float through the city.

c1450ab2-06f2-4fb2-9044-cefb3a435132-0
02:08:37.230 --> 02:08:37.870
And.

397f90e5-fee2-42de-b0c2-22027f364054-0
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:40.090
There's a boat.

062f9236-228c-428c-9c5c-2fd10ffc5a7d-0
02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:44.960
Up on a bridge of a of an arch,
that is.

c58a0f04-b614-48e8-9b2b-0e976dd18718-0
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:50.418
Floating across the bridge. And
it's the same bridge that this

c58a0f04-b614-48e8-9b2b-0e976dd18718-1
02:08:50.418 --> 02:08:54.105
little red boat was floating
across that the father was

c58a0f04-b614-48e8-9b2b-0e976dd18718-2
02:08:54.105 --> 02:08:57.924
chasing and saw. And and so
somehow this little boat will

c58a0f04-b614-48e8-9b2b-0e976dd18718-3
02:08:57.924 --> 02:09:00.690
get up to that bridge and we'll
find out.

5977f8ad-05d3-483b-beaf-e48930a5944a-0
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:03.850
In the next few pages, we can
turn the page.

c539bb9a-8130-4df8-8063-e0b4fa266a34-0
02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:16.502
So the little boat makes its way
through the locks and through

c539bb9a-8130-4df8-8063-e0b4fa266a34-1
02:09:16.502 --> 02:09:21.306
the dams of the of the city, and
as she's floating by in her

c539bb9a-8130-4df8-8063-e0b4fa266a34-2
02:09:21.306 --> 02:09:26.111
little red boat, people are
waving to her. The soldiers seem

c539bb9a-8130-4df8-8063-e0b4fa266a34-3
02:09:26.111 --> 02:09:30.679
very friendly this time, and
they're allowing her to pass

c539bb9a-8130-4df8-8063-e0b4fa266a34-4
02:09:30.679 --> 02:09:31.310
through.

57646ca1-a1aa-44b4-ba96-b6f0b15dc6d2-0
02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:33.510
Rather easily.

406da9f7-e66b-484e-a146-5f6bf364354a-0
02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:38.815
And there are people boating all
around. There's it looks,

406da9f7-e66b-484e-a146-5f6bf364354a-1
02:09:38.815 --> 02:09:39.500
resembles.

9ec28ddc-6993-4b1f-9d52-dc0dd1b2af22-0
02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:44.893
A lot like Venice, the types of
boats that you would find in

9ec28ddc-6993-4b1f-9d52-dc0dd1b2af22-1
02:09:44.893 --> 02:09:45.870
Venice, Italy.

1f2e0f8d-952e-47ed-b271-23829935bcad-0
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:50.160
But it's a strange and.

79c3106c-216a-435d-beee-2175f2873ada-0
02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:53.230
A strange and.

14d07aa1-43b0-4ca5-bc5e-8ed43c45e591-0
02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:56.110
Fantastical city.

7ff19ade-1351-44c7-8fc6-64cbee1b904a-0
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:57.310
Next page.

29d2105e-2c77-4b7f-b18e-6ee4460f15bb-0
02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:05.455
Oh, on this page, the little
girl and her boat come to a

29d2105e-2c77-4b7f-b18e-6ee4460f15bb-1
02:10:05.455 --> 02:10:08.220
water fountain, a waterfall,
and.

48a44fe1-32af-4126-a951-1c0de7dc941d-0
02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:12.380
Her boat is going to go over the
waterfall.

4b736a27-9180-468d-aa1b-32ba4039969c-0
02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:18.733
And as she looks down over the
Cliff to where the water's

4b736a27-9180-468d-aa1b-32ba4039969c-1
02:10:18.733 --> 02:10:23.052
going, she flies out of her
boat, but she pulls out her

4b736a27-9180-468d-aa1b-32ba4039969c-2
02:10:23.052 --> 02:10:27.834
crayon and draws in the air as
she's tumbling through the air

4b736a27-9180-468d-aa1b-32ba4039969c-3
02:10:27.834 --> 02:10:30.920
and the boat is falling down
next page.

e9ac3995-f4e3-4224-b407-4af93d520cd9-0
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:43.499
And as she tumbles through the
air, her crayon makes a round

e9ac3995-f4e3-4224-b407-4af93d520cd9-1
02:10:43.499 --> 02:10:49.096
circle, and that circle becomes
her balloon, her hot air

e9ac3995-f4e3-4224-b407-4af93d520cd9-2
02:10:49.096 --> 02:10:54.987
balloon, and it saves her from
from landing in in the water

e9ac3995-f4e3-4224-b407-4af93d520cd9-3
02:10:54.987 --> 02:10:55.380
and.

a7e7cb4f-1412-49c5-8da6-b5e8702f20f4-0
02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:00.392
It looks this this hot air
balloon looks very much like the

a7e7cb4f-1412-49c5-8da6-b5e8702f20f4-1
02:11:00.392 --> 02:11:04.452
light that was in her room. And
so the little girl is in the

a7e7cb4f-1412-49c5-8da6-b5e8702f20f4-2
02:11:04.452 --> 02:11:08.511
basket that's attached to the
red balloon and is floating up

a7e7cb4f-1412-49c5-8da6-b5e8702f20f4-3
02:11:08.511 --> 02:11:12.305
through the sky, and the
soldiers are waving to her, and

a7e7cb4f-1412-49c5-8da6-b5e8702f20f4-4
02:11:12.305 --> 02:11:15.299
she's waving goodbye as she
begins to float.

881485eb-ec8a-48d2-81e8-608e299f58c3-0
02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:22.342
And as she floats the next page,
you can see the purple bird that

881485eb-ec8a-48d2-81e8-608e299f58c3-1
02:11:22.342 --> 02:11:28.091
had become a had befriended her
and her brother and her father

881485eb-ec8a-48d2-81e8-608e299f58c3-2
02:11:28.091 --> 02:11:29.460
when they were.

524b42d7-a33c-43f6-a4e1-7a457fa0f29e-0
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:36.606
Escaping the city and that's in
the sky are these dirigibles

524b42d7-a33c-43f6-a4e1-7a457fa0f29e-1
02:11:36.606 --> 02:11:42.448
that are floating through the
air, that carry people from here

524b42d7-a33c-43f6-a4e1-7a457fa0f29e-2
02:11:42.448 --> 02:11:48.476
to there like the buses of this
city's time, and also a big ship

524b42d7-a33c-43f6-a4e1-7a457fa0f29e-3
02:11:48.476 --> 02:11:53.947
with a steam wheel on it that
makes it fly through the the

524b42d7-a33c-43f6-a4e1-7a457fa0f29e-4
02:11:53.947 --> 02:11:56.080
clouds or allows it to.

06821a6c-9c6c-4914-af2c-9b49cea49ba2-0
02:11:57.450 --> 02:12:01.640
Float on the water and make its
way through the water.

b0abf542-f49b-49a7-93f7-face919557ee-0
02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:11.880
So the little girl takes by the
soldiers, and then?

1ae02a98-c835-43a0-bb37-459db7c9ff4b-0
02:12:12.570 --> 02:12:16.613
Looks forward where her balloon
is floating and as as her

1ae02a98-c835-43a0-bb37-459db7c9ff4b-1
02:12:16.613 --> 02:12:20.587
balloons floating up, she
notices some of the dirigibles

1ae02a98-c835-43a0-bb37-459db7c9ff4b-2
02:12:20.587 --> 02:12:24.840
flying in the air and the big
ship that's flying in the air.

514c0368-15bf-4b6b-b65d-0224d8aaf7b0-0
02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:30.637
And she sees that that there the
Gold Knight is such a

514c0368-15bf-4b6b-b65d-0224d8aaf7b0-1
02:12:30.637 --> 02:12:35.980
troublemaker, is now still
trying to catch the purple bird.

807bf4aa-dd19-4219-bb2d-46cec2161500-0
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:42.539
And one of his, a couple of his
three of his Knights have a net

807bf4aa-dd19-4219-bb2d-46cec2161500-1
02:12:42.539 --> 02:12:48.478
in their hand and they're trying
to grab the bird with a net to

807bf4aa-dd19-4219-bb2d-46cec2161500-2
02:12:48.478 --> 02:12:51.170
because the golden cage that.

4731cfce-0c3b-4b50-98ab-f7c0d897340d-0
02:12:52.110 --> 02:12:55.861
The bird is supposed to be
captured in is sitting on this

4731cfce-0c3b-4b50-98ab-f7c0d897340d-1
02:12:55.861 --> 02:13:00.065
dirigible, and they're going to
put him in there when they catch

4731cfce-0c3b-4b50-98ab-f7c0d897340d-2
02:13:00.065 --> 02:13:00.260
it.

f74ac8c3-6a4d-4734-9628-0cd120f14462-0
02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:02.600
But they haven't caught it yet.

edb61ba2-8fbe-4b1e-8a37-b82eb0aec13e-0
02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:04.010
Turn the page.

d6595b24-f3d8-4173-8b57-b4117da7140b-0
02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:10.595
The the the balloon and the
little girl keep floating and

d6595b24-f3d8-4173-8b57-b4117da7140b-1
02:13:10.595 --> 02:13:11.220
they float.

251fa70c-72f9-4a3f-87f2-f5a8df067ab6-0
02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:13.280
Towards the big.

7fcc4e00-8e53-41ca-897d-30a1fa8252d1-0
02:13:14.010 --> 02:13:14.550
Ship.

4acf94b8-cbea-4b5e-9619-4338ed815b32-0
02:13:16.810 --> 02:13:17.480
Where?

203cc318-3cd0-4a83-8650-293d36025e07-0
02:13:18.150 --> 02:13:20.880
She sees that they actually did
catch.

0cb0ebc9-e3c7-46ba-b02b-ab732469582f-0
02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:22.670
The bird.

f54ee9c0-a570-4da4-a6ac-b1acbda4d60e-0
02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:26.710
They have taken it back to the
ship and it is.

5df08556-d416-4e76-8cb1-21645f5ae10c-0
02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:33.010
Sitting in its cage, I'm up on a
platform and the king is proud

5df08556-d416-4e76-8cb1-21645f5ae10c-1
02:13:33.010 --> 02:13:33.800
to display.

06e9391a-0222-4a00-b77b-599b936c8158-0
02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:40.431
Or they're lowering it, I'm
sorry, from the dirigible to to

06e9391a-0222-4a00-b77b-599b936c8158-1
02:13:40.431 --> 02:13:46.183
the big boat where that they're
waiting for it to put it on

06e9391a-0222-4a00-b77b-599b936c8158-2
02:13:46.183 --> 02:13:51.839
display in the shiny new cage
that's on the next page. I'm

06e9391a-0222-4a00-b77b-599b936c8158-3
02:13:51.839 --> 02:13:57.782
sitting on this boat that that
has the steam wheel that flies

06e9391a-0222-4a00-b77b-599b936c8158-4
02:13:57.782 --> 02:13:59.700
it through this sky.

80a3e463-c77e-49a8-a3c2-da47fb9389a1-0
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:05.250
And the little girl is just
floating by in her.

7983d54a-de7b-470e-896b-b5b0188c3a95-0
02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:07.430
On air balloon next page.

dc39a1dd-90a8-45f8-bf72-1c8b05ad0475-0
02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:18.197
So the little girl in the
balloon, they dock on this big

dc39a1dd-90a8-45f8-bf72-1c8b05ad0475-1
02:14:18.197 --> 02:14:22.732
ship, there's a platform and
they dock, and then she runs

dc39a1dd-90a8-45f8-bf72-1c8b05ad0475-2
02:14:22.732 --> 02:14:24.140
across the bridge.

1fc433a3-e977-4532-9beb-48c21e5f192e-0
02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:30.410
Towards a door that will take
her to the internal parts of the

ship.

26b1b2f0-c211-4ea9-b74b-491c07c061e7-0
02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:37.492
And we don't know where she's
headed yet, but we do see that

26b1b2f0-c211-4ea9-b74b-491c07c061e7-1
02:14:37.492 --> 02:14:41.570
if she if there are stairs
inside this big.

02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:44.400
Smokestack.

2ad8557e-8a09-4599-b804-9383c5dee31a-0
02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:50.857
They can get her up to another
bridge where the the Gold Knight

2ad8557e-8a09-4599-b804-9383c5dee31a-1
02:14:50.857 --> 02:14:56.340
and his his Knights and the the
bird in the cage are being taken

2ad8557e-8a09-4599-b804-9383c5dee31a-2
02:14:56.340 --> 02:15:01.147
into another smokestack and
little girls running towards

2ad8557e-8a09-4599-b804-9383c5dee31a-3
02:15:01.147 --> 02:15:06.123
that. And on the next page it
shows that the bird has been

2ad8557e-8a09-4599-b804-9383c5dee31a-4
02:15:06.123 --> 02:15:11.268
captured and put in the cage and
is now being guarded by two

2ad8557e-8a09-4599-b804-9383c5dee31a-5
02:15:11.268 --> 02:15:13.040
soldiers with Spears.

a5ff8aa6-b15f-4622-ba39-94343e7eed32-0
02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:17.580
Who are under threat of death if
they let anything happen to the

a5ff8aa6-b15f-4622-ba39-94343e7eed32-1
02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:17.850
bird.

ce749b02-7d8a-4992-91f3-93eb9494f3b9-0
02:15:18.570 --> 02:15:21.180
And it's in this Beautiful
golden.

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:25.800
Next page.

467b1f53-d60d-4733-afbc-21f64395e91f-0
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:34.097
Oh, I forgot to notice that on
the last page the girl found

467b1f53-d60d-4733-afbc-21f64395e91f-1
02:15:34.097 --> 02:15:38.230
followed the soldiers and was
climbing up a ladder.

e4efe246-47b8-41b9-821b-13aae4052336-0
02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:39.430
Umm.

714bc709-8885-40dc-9140-f18499888d8e-0
02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:42.280
With her.

feca0692-e420-4d33-9aab-9f8e47b87a2d-0
02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:47.900
Red Pen in hand and snuck up on
the soldiers and grabbed the

feca0692-e420-4d33-9aab-9f8e47b87a2d-1
02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:52.583
bird and ran away. And so on
that page the soldiers are in

feca0692-e420-4d33-9aab-9f8e47b87a2d-2
02:15:52.583 --> 02:15:57.662
shock and they're telling her to
stop and one of them loses his

feca0692-e420-4d33-9aab-9f8e47b87a2d-3
02:15:57.662 --> 02:16:01.630
spear and the little girl just
runs for her life.

dc7e2178-cf1b-4184-8a15-24b076f59796-0
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:06.666
And the next picture is a
picture of the insides of the

dc7e2178-cf1b-4184-8a15-24b076f59796-1
02:16:06.666 --> 02:16:11.376
boat and the panic that she's
created. The soldiers are all

dc7e2178-cf1b-4184-8a15-24b076f59796-2
02:16:11.376 --> 02:16:13.260
running and the boat is.

0b25b27a-ce5c-4e92-bb60-501c0c214a10-0
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:20.416
Four stories high and all the
soldiers are focused on getting

0b25b27a-ce5c-4e92-bb60-501c0c214a10-1
02:16:20.416 --> 02:16:25.630
to the girl who is going to free
the beautiful purple bird.

29c0bbf7-ee89-4aad-a4d9-d6bc756e737e-0
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:30.370
And so she sets the cage down
and opens it and frees the bird.

9f52e860-1966-430d-8b20-122c27ab9b3b-0
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:36.021
As the soldiers are running
towards her to capture her, and

9f52e860-1966-430d-8b20-122c27ab9b3b-1
02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:40.293
the Gold Knight is standing at
the top of his boat pointing

9f52e860-1966-430d-8b20-122c27ab9b3b-2
02:16:40.293 --> 02:16:44.920
down to the bird and telling his
soldiers to go and find her and

9f52e860-1966-430d-8b20-122c27ab9b3b-3
02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:45.490
grab it.

85b369a7-ec3b-420f-9561-d44aa8adfe1c-0
02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:49.704
But the bird is free and now the
little girl is stuck on the

85b369a7-ec3b-420f-9561-d44aa8adfe1c-1
02:16:49.704 --> 02:16:49.980
boat.

bb64afe9-7ae9-4352-87fe-f8a1fca3c81d-0
02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:51.200
Next.

5f8387ab-7cd9-4717-b17b-f5305ba041a5-0
02:16:54.760 --> 02:17:00.541
The soldiers grabbed the girl
and the king that the gold

5f8387ab-7cd9-4717-b17b-f5305ba041a5-1
02:17:00.541 --> 02:17:02.570
Knight comes to the.

02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:08.181
Place where she's standing with
the empty cage and throws her

b7f2e166-cc77-4814-b951-1f2d20691f7f-1
02:17:08.181 --> 02:17:12.000
crayon over the edge so that she
has no way to.

06a255d5-f359-48af-9d92-0896e8e39e04-0
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.680
Escape.

ecd13b01-8655-4126-b5a7-a044d6ef3c6f-0
02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:15.470
And so.

e660bafa-af58-408a-aacb-b36fea38ca50-0
02:17:16.850 --> 02:17:18.520
They put her in a cage.

e9103950-101a-4e7e-ae21-a8fd38850354-0
02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:24.516
On the next page they show her
being put in a cage and the

e9103950-101a-4e7e-ae21-a8fd38850354-1
02:17:24.516 --> 02:17:29.755
soldiers lowering her off of the
ship. Down, down, down and as

e9103950-101a-4e7e-ae21-a8fd38850354-2
02:17:29.755 --> 02:17:33.830
she's being lowered she's
looking over the edge.

180d03f2-34b2-46ef-a918-89a18d2ffe40-0
02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:37.330
To see where she's going to land
next page.

8747fe86-0734-43cc-8fa7-49b4a77435c9-0
02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:47.400
And to everyone surprise, the
purple bird.

095ecc1f-9d16-4b3c-834a-8dc810310b8c-0
02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:52.896
Finds her red crayon and flies
towards the little girl who is

095ecc1f-9d16-4b3c-834a-8dc810310b8c-1
02:17:52.896 --> 02:17:57.692
rejoicing and happy and jumping
up and down, waving her arms at

095ecc1f-9d16-4b3c-834a-8dc810310b8c-2
02:17:57.692 --> 02:18:00.090
the bird for coming to save her.

e0ea1b05-5d5e-4de7-9713-1df7ecb5e6e1-0
02:18:00.850 --> 02:18:04.200
And on the next page it's a
white page with three scenes.

794b6273-9441-4450-b371-74e43a79de59-0
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:11.175
Where the girl takes the the
bird lands on her shoulder and

794b6273-9441-4450-b371-74e43a79de59-1
02:18:11.175 --> 02:18:16.488
hands her the red crayon, and
she gets down on her knees and

794b6273-9441-4450-b371-74e43a79de59-2
02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:18.840
begins to draw a rectangle.

266ddaa0-3cd7-4097-a0a7-ccd165f72e6f-0
02:18:19.670 --> 02:18:24.604
And the little bird flies off of
her shoulder and sits on the

266ddaa0-3cd7-4097-a0a7-ccd165f72e6f-1
02:18:24.604 --> 02:18:27.550
ground beside her as she draws
this.

f05e8265-45f2-4a78-a859-a6718c78dc7d-0
02:18:28.390 --> 02:18:31.300
Purple rectangle.

a4cd5c13-963f-4a8f-b269-3b2fd2460903-0
02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:33.680
Next page.

0e2c575d-4699-484a-b1a7-0cb90b688dba-0
02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.538
This page is a view from the
ship, the flying ship, and it

0e2c575d-4699-484a-b1a7-0cb90b688dba-1
02:18:46.538 --> 02:18:51.071
sees that the the little girl's
cage is empty and we're looking

0e2c575d-4699-484a-b1a7-0cb90b688dba-2
02:18:51.071 --> 02:18:55.603
down into the city on the wall,
the great walled city with palm

0e2c575d-4699-484a-b1a7-0cb90b688dba-3
02:18:55.603 --> 02:18:57.870
trees and people walking around.

9a1d87f8-fcce-4a04-bae9-3ee8e8eec9e7-0
02:18:59.210 --> 02:19:02.635
But on the next page, it shows
that what the little girl was

9a1d87f8-fcce-4a04-bae9-3ee8e8eec9e7-1
02:19:02.635 --> 02:19:04.770
actually drawing was a flying
carpet.

dd571e8b-efd6-49dc-b498-bb7c90ac732c-0
02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.781
And this is allowing her to fly
above the city and the way from

dd571e8b-efd6-49dc-b498-bb7c90ac732c-1
02:19:10.781 --> 02:19:15.622
the city and follow the purple
bird as he shows her which

dd571e8b-efd6-49dc-b498-bb7c90ac732c-2
02:19:15.622 --> 02:19:20.964
direction to fly and they fly on
this page. They're flying past

dd571e8b-efd6-49dc-b498-bb7c90ac732c-3
02:19:20.964 --> 02:19:22.549
the beautiful tall.

265fcfa7-91aa-4bf2-bf49-7a1cc6d6cd84-0

02:19:31.330 --> 02:19:32.190
It looks like.

42ee13c8-3060-47b5-a4bd-f413ebf31775-0
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.820
It's.

We're following the purple bird
next page.

c70d47f1-f977-4747-a080-ee99244b9fcd-0
02:19:58.010 --> 02:20:00.560
And they fly away from the city.

a84fbf1f-eb40-418a-9b20-ff76c0f6ccd5-0
02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:03.460
It's the night sky.

82781bf8-e90a-4d2f-ae33-c425bb5a6836-0
02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:09.878
It's getting dark and the stars
are coming out and the little

82781bf8-e90a-4d2f-ae33-c425bb5a6836-1
02:20:09.878 --> 02:20:14.736
girl is flying on her magic
carpet over a beautiful scene of

82781bf8-e90a-4d2f-ae33-c425bb5a6836-2
02:20:14.736 --> 02:20:19.674
of the desert and the mountains
and following the purple bird

82781bf8-e90a-4d2f-ae33-c425bb5a6836-3
02:20:19.674 --> 02:20:20.790
towards alone.

74171a70-568a-4539-b494-6474b1271116-0
02:20:23.130 --> 02:20:29.690
Palm tree in the desert with
what looks to be a possible door

74171a70-568a-4539-b494-6474b1271116-1
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:30.960
in the base.

02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:32.790
And next?

151c4c2e-8bdd-4d3e-a8f8-8a1b4af9db34-0
02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:42.058
And the little girl sees the
tree and lands her carpet near

151c4c2e-8bdd-4d3e-a8f8-8a1b4af9db34-1
02:20:42.058 --> 02:20:47.397
the tree, something under her
red crayon. She walks towards

151c4c2e-8bdd-4d3e-a8f8-8a1b4af9db34-2
02:20:47.397 --> 02:20:52.824
the door that she saw in the
face of the tree with back then

151c4c2e-8bdd-4d3e-a8f8-8a1b4af9db34-3
02:20:52.824 --> 02:20:58.518
and then. Next page is a picture
of the scene of three pictures

151c4c2e-8bdd-4d3e-a8f8-8a1b4af9db34-4
02:20:58.518 --> 02:21:01.900
where the little girl opens the
door.

b8372002-d879-42a2-b4c4-2ec706046b13-0
02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:07.614
And there's white light coming
out. And the little purple bird

b8372002-d879-42a2-b4c4-2ec706046b13-1
02:21:07.614 --> 02:21:12.276
flies into the door and the
little girl crawls into the door

b8372002-d879-42a2-b4c4-2ec706046b13-2
02:21:12.276 --> 02:21:16.709
and be in it back home. {Oh,

b8372002-d879-42a2-b4c4-2ec706046b13-3
02:21:16.709 --> 02:21:17.550
That's OK.}

02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:24.710
That's.

little boy. And he's just so

02:24:38.574 --> 02:24:43.004
picture is of the little boy
helping the little girl stand

afbf9e04-96fe-4d4d-a200-746208ad5ba8-3
02:24:43.004 --> 02:24:43.230

02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:49.273
And he has the purple bird on
his hands. And the next picture

7a53657a-9afb-40b4-8a05-6504fcd8d6ae-1
02:24:49.273 --> 02:24:54.377
is of the little girl drawing a
circle red circle. And the

7a53657a-9afb-40b4-8a05-6504fcd8d6ae-2
02:24:54.377 --> 02:24:59.567
little boy has his purple marker
in his hand and he draws a

7a53657a-9afb-40b4-8a05-6504fcd8d6ae-3
02:24:59.567 --> 02:25:04.844
circle just like the girl and
the little purple bird. Or the

7a53657a-9afb-40b4-8a05-6504fcd8d6ae-4
02:25:04.844 --> 02:25:10.121
purple bird flies up off the
boy's shoulder and was covering

02:25:10.121 --> 02:25:11.160
both places.

02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:18.790
And out of the purple.

02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.672
Circle and the red circle, the
boy and the girl make a bike.

7e09cd8d-727e-4204-b222-29dcd1d7dc9f-1
02:25:24.672 --> 02:25:29.209
They add their their. They need
tires to make a bike, a tandem

7e09cd8d-727e-4204-b222-29dcd1d7dc9f-2
02:25:29.209 --> 02:25:33.674
in which they're going to ride.
And in this scene, the little

02:25:33.674 --> 02:25:38.067
girl points the direction she's
in the seat in front and the

7e09cd8d-727e-4204-b222-29dcd1d7dc9f-4
02:25:38.067 --> 02:25:41.956
little boys in the seat and
back, and she points that

7e09cd8d-727e-4204-b222-29dcd1d7dc9f-5
02:25:41.956 --> 02:25:46.637
they're going straight ahead and
the purple bird is flying right

7e09cd8d-727e-4204-b222-29dcd1d7dc9f-6
02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:51.029
behind them to protect them. And
you can also see the sewer.
