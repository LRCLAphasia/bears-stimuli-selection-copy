cb5e9cdf-2ef4-46ac-ab24-9c7cbbf107c6-0
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.970
OK.

0a1f5204-90ca-4936-b517-e4d6809c44c2-0
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.017
All right. So almost there with
our study. This next one is a

0a1f5204-90ca-4936-b517-e4d6809c44c2-1
00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:11.730
graphic novel that has around 8
pages. So again, describe what

0a1f5204-90ca-4936-b517-e4d6809c44c2-2
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.442
you see and what is happening as
you go through the story. OK.

0a1f5204-90ca-4936-b517-e4d6809c44c2-3
00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:19.210
And you can start when you're
ready.

68da8db0-7266-4572-aab3-ed551c9bf6b5-0
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.890
OK, wait a minute.

8d295d2b-9aac-444a-8673-cf3611dd86af-0
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.410
#START_arrival_5 OK, so I see a
man.

f251736f-f0d3-4d79-aecf-02403bd204ed-0
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.570
Taking a shower.

d6979fef-8858-46b2-8070-d15267cd3d71-0
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.868
And Umm, and of course I see the
shower, the mechanisms, and and

d6979fef-8858-46b2-8070-d15267cd3d71-1
00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:47.350
the next picture he's appears to
be shaving.

eec2f998-fb46-42da-a830-ef86a73088bd-0
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.060
He has a.

c22a4dbd-fab9-4402-8b89-e361dc474b5d-0
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.390
Shaving cream on his face and
he's bending over a sink.

52d218d2-38ef-4ebd-aeba-c5bbb665ef37-0
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.890
And then the next one, he's
getting dressed.

9c04bfa3-4a56-4dbc-91b6-a6bc839a172a-0
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.807
And putting on his weight, his
vest. Then in the next picture,

9c04bfa3-4a56-4dbc-91b6-a6bc839a172a-1
00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:08.560
he's tying his shoes.

fa0b8e24-b0f7-48ee-82ed-48c7f6b47137-0
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.320
And um.

f3de05bf-a7b7-40f5-880b-9975455e2003-0
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.100
Here he's counting his money.

081282b4-9e8d-4946-bd2a-c454592552cc-0
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.435
I guess to make sure he has
enough fair to get on the bus or

081282b4-9e8d-4946-bd2a-c454592552cc-1
00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:24.010
whatever he's riding and then
here he's getting grabbing his

081282b4-9e8d-4946-bd2a-c454592552cc-2
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.310
hat.

d77b20e7-7ab4-4271-b26a-806286c03773-0
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.690
And the next picture, he's
looking at a city map.

57c48991-d948-4b54-92e0-894bbee84edf-0
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.789
And the next one, and the next
two, he's still looking at the

57c48991-d948-4b54-92e0-894bbee84edf-1
00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:38.840
city map.

4ebd1817-32c4-42c9-9856-714a3e504102-0
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.961
And with his pet looking up at
him, and then he's walking down

4ebd1817-32c4-42c9-9856-714a3e504102-1
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.874
the street with his pet
following him, I see a fire

4ebd1817-32c4-42c9-9856-714a3e504102-2
00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.530
hydrant. Other people.

5b9d7990-894f-45d3-9173-0358626ec393-0
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.240
And then I see a boat. I mean,
it's not a boat.

46b422f8-ad52-41bd-8598-5026a398c3dc-0
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.690
Roads, like a freeway and
buildings and clouds.

b2bd6d50-7aaf-467c-bea2-ceb16a0856fa-0
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.510
And then

5a8fbd83-8f55-4fe9-a38e-4f333a06ac52-0
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.020
Umm, another map. Street street
map.

ee66a889-a0cb-42f5-b435-1eecff2a85db-0
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.270
And he's looking at the street
map, confused. And then in the

ee66a889-a0cb-42f5-b435-1eecff2a85db-1
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.640
other one he has, his pet is
looking at him.

0b53baaf-08f3-4061-b4a1-d7113320acd9-0
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.190
And then I see.

d9033a76-8543-4a37-a17a-7102aff6ab21-0
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.530
Uh, a lot of people.

6714e10b-d44a-46d5-95a7-a2d8d3fd23f8-0
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.030
They seem to be standing on some
type of platform.

f032c189-012b-4b1a-ab42-9e8355d5ff6f-0
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.350
With um.

0fd0bde5-db42-40e7-82cf-8842bf5af109-0
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.500
Pointed buildings.

2de7eeca-02f5-48ed-b30a-63b7cbbc364e-0
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.347
Yeah. And then over that
they're, they seem to be under a

2de7eeca-02f5-48ed-b30a-63b7cbbc364e-1
00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:48.770
bridge because I see a.

e3fa3049-c858-4c9f-9078-d97d0b762ca7-0
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.610
Whatever these are, flying over
them.

0efc539e-ac8a-4b32-9459-b9b128cc1ae3-0
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.120
Hmm.

eb623651-b174-458f-9673-849c58233094-0
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.550
OK, then the then the pet.

afb053c5-36a4-453f-85d8-b6ceacc55755-0
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.174
Is, well, I'm gonna say, talking
to another pet, and the other

afb053c5-36a4-453f-85d8-b6ceacc55755-1
00:03:10.174 --> 00:03:13.070
pet belongs to some woman.

b8a27a9e-2838-494a-9da2-c74f1698c55c-0
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.889
So, uh, they're standing next to
the man and then he's talking to

b8a27a9e-2838-494a-9da2-c74f1698c55c-1
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:21.270
her.

f415928c-ecc4-4f4e-8caa-9c7cd5f9cae9-0
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.250
She's holding a book.

086a2ed0-eaf8-4a28-9993-e9336017f7c4-0
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.400
And he's talking to her.

459e2463-0e7a-4b12-a1a6-3910cbba2803-0
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.080
And probably asking directions.

d8cd3329-3495-47c0-85a0-65f2cde80a71-0
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.760
So they're both looking at the
at the map and.

e7a2e80c-a762-409a-8aa1-08c9fe5428d3-0
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.370
Um. And then she's pointing to
certain things.

81595a31-89d4-4cb9-8845-4d49ecf18ece-0
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.690
And um.

6958e8e6-b19b-4594-b537-cbdd0ee67219-0
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.770
And I guess she's still talking
to him.

85aac914-4681-41b3-971d-492b534b18cd-0
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.170
And that's that's apparently a
phone behind them, behind her.

69888978-4dd5-4e9d-9157-55c1ec750314-0
00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.760
And so.

ae06261a-65ce-42ff-bed6-232de98fdde0-0
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.160
Somebody is dialing a number of
phone or something, but

ae06261a-65ce-42ff-bed6-232de98fdde0-1
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.402
somebody's dialing a number with
a, it's old fashioned phones,

ae06261a-65ce-42ff-bed6-232de98fdde0-2
00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:16.480
Rotary phones, and then she
pulls on the handle.

4e9c3bf7-8f34-4355-bfdf-67b97522d788-0
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.020
Looks like a slot machine, but
and then so the ticket comes

4e9c3bf7-8f34-4355-bfdf-67b97522d788-1
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.764
out, then she showing him the
ticket, then she gives him the

4e9c3bf7-8f34-4355-bfdf-67b97522d788-2
00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:29.800
ticket and.

d972bdba-f187-44c9-9f96-85a46e2327c3-0
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.772
And here I think they're looking
at a watch, trying to figure out

d972bdba-f187-44c9-9f96-85a46e2327c3-1
00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:36.560
what time the.

9d0000f2-b8b0-4039-b66c-9d85df20a965-0
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.060
Whatever he's waiting for is
coming.

5d68752c-2625-48b1-b808-4da2a3015c87-0
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.830
And then up here.

ca1ccf89-e26a-427f-b406-c10b5ad7b4af-0
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.270
They're all looking up.

26bd4dc4-e9fe-4f72-80bf-5b6550a98f4a-0
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.670
Looks like flying boats to me
and.

d13cf468-a132-4d0a-a582-090451f50bae-0
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.170
And here.

d3f0b8dd-12e2-4145-aa5a-622567b884f8-0
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.120
I see people.

be9b81fc-d3b8-4a44-8ab6-f08843d64beb-0
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.210
Other flying boats.

07a057a8-bb81-4a6e-a0b5-37ac61825881-0
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.140
And then here one is landing.

0914ecf2-87bd-4fa7-9800-e86ab01dcef5-0
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.850
And then now it's landed. Him
and his pet get on it.

b5f73292-e2da-4072-b1c8-00e17469f423-0
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.461
He shows the guy the ticket, the
conductor, and he stamps it or

b5f73292-e2da-4072-b1c8-00e17469f423-1
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:24.097
punches a hole through it or
whatever and and then welcomes

b5f73292-e2da-4072-b1c8-00e17469f423-2
00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:28.700
him onto this, this whatever it
is, this vessel.

b9cea108-3fce-4ed8-8bfb-8b7036e02869-0
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.630
OK then.

1e4cbd07-1931-455d-a71f-4f7be2785523-0
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.990
So now the man is sitting down.

3a0d54fe-ac4f-49b9-9fcd-3a9b168766f8-0
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.290
Or getting ready to sit down,
him and his pet.

92136268-07c4-4c47-b79e-6e57314293f3-0
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.980
Then um.

eadf6fb7-6b25-4c3f-a129-52a7d10467db-0
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.650
Then they're sitting down and
he's talking to I don't know if

eadf6fb7-6b25-4c3f-a129-52a7d10467db-1
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.700
it's the same lady or a lady.

eb39215e-8004-4b73-a5e0-0e3aa5e84ccf-0
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.011
Um with her pet in her lap, and
I see a a woman and a baby,

eb39215e-8004-4b73-a5e0-0e3aa5e84ccf-1
00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:07.520
another man, two other men, and
then here.

5ec938cd-54e9-4e5a-9758-64d484b85683-0
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.210
They're still talking.

ed93f5e1-9d64-432a-920a-7e89f5fc51d4-0
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.360
Looks like he's still confused
about something.

6f4ca16a-6fe2-485f-8525-90de0a8f96c8-0
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.310
And now he's reaching in his
pocket to show her.

b627b374-b726-448a-bb33-9a8ccdb6008b-0
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.180
Something, and that something
turns out to be a picture.

e44e4636-09c6-48ca-9d58-d6163aa0f967-0
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.620
And she looks at it.

8122c35d-1a49-4be2-85ee-fb8bc68c1eca-0
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.975
And I see your pet in the
background and she's saying

8122c35d-1a49-4be2-85ee-fb8bc68c1eca-1
00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:39.640
something to him and then she
reaches into her purse.

6a6758e4-45d0-4ebe-90c5-cb92f85febb2-0
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.710
Pulls out a picture the exact
same way.

abbb96c6-eab5-4d4d-8038-f7e529a2cbb4-0
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.928
Only her picture was on it, so
maybe that's a passport or

abbb96c6-eab5-4d4d-8038-f7e529a2cbb4-1
00:06:51.928 --> 00:06:57.974
something. OK, so now here, up
here, somebody's reading a book.

abbb96c6-eab5-4d4d-8038-f7e529a2cbb4-2
00:06:57.974 --> 00:06:58.730
A woman.

b804515c-95d4-47fe-a4d0-8dfc9e34f565-0
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.020
And looks like somebody's trying
to take the book from her.

cd05eb93-4b73-430c-a8a9-687b18c698d6-0
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.200
And took it and put it in a
drawer.

fff904bf-5e8b-4e15-8ed5-559e57947db4-0
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.800
And then uh.

34d041f9-454e-4fa9-bdc4-a1ffbf286301-0
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.740
Hmm.

fa2ed20b-30fe-4833-9c83-42b8889528ae-0
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.940
Then I see a lock and a key.

d735d431-ec7d-4559-9b4f-8f5e5cc2afd2-0
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.420
I don't know if she's the one
that's locked up.

ffdd3a2e-0fea-49de-b6df-a0bd07c45bd3-0
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:30.960
But somebody's uh locking a
lock, and they hand her a

ffdd3a2e-0fea-49de-b6df-a0bd07c45bd3-1
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.950
shovel.

4bf04205-4e56-4cb6-8e2a-9e5e723963f3-0
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.600
And I see a woman or somebody
pointing.

24667d9d-0e6d-4509-bbb8-8ca3e0315408-0
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.720
Tell her what to do, and now she
has to.

ec9ba52b-991e-4a80-b59d-e1c4dac67763-0
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.650
Shovel coal into this fire,
furnace.

62e6f5ab-7da9-40aa-9fed-2195f24b9fc0-0
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.374
So that's what she's doing.
She's shoveling coal into the

62e6f5ab-7da9-40aa-9fed-2195f24b9fc0-1
00:07:51.374 --> 00:07:51.990
furnace.

0daea6df-fcd8-463b-9cba-42a2bdcba706-0
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.610
And um.

f47c0022-9b40-45aa-a35b-806f1695f979-0
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.157
I see smoke coming out of it, so
I guess that means that the the

f47c0022-9b40-45aa-a35b-806f1695f979-1
00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:05.090
chimney part is closed so she
has to climb up the ladder.

c46d238c-a2cc-4c44-91b8-4afa413c1fe8-0
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.930
And and open it.

0125eff2-59db-4ced-9567-d55e0be240c0-0
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.940
Hmm.

5b663f65-84ad-47cc-b782-0984019426d8-0
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.360
OK, here they're on.

e6fe17ad-6ea4-4a79-b145-fe83d2c7c2bf-0
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:23.600
Ohh seems to be a big building
with nothing but furnaces.

8ec8b39e-bee4-4f9a-9e09-d7a1175ef464-0
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:31.940
And everybody's job is to shovel
coal into these furnaces.

e718981e-df61-40d5-a196-7781095d1a50-0
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.670
OK, so.

84af44ca-05ca-425f-a20d-c4a8cd5e4d5b-0
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.977
Up here you have somebody either
crying or just upset about

84af44ca-05ca-425f-a20d-c4a8cd5e4d5b-1
00:08:40.977 --> 00:08:41.850
something.

6e62d479-7ee3-4f3d-a909-81bd3e94e6be-0
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.750
And then the lady with the
shovel.

e7798056-df8d-456d-9b65-f2f880cd4fbb-0
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.520
She's looking up.

353d50da-6063-4b2f-98c3-663731e50dae-0
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.160
Then looks to me like, OK, she
uses the shovel to open the

353d50da-6063-4b2f-98c3-663731e50dae-1
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.490
door.

f78d3ce4-dea8-4018-b332-f91c2e142f5e-0
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.780
And then she goes in.

e3367021-2465-4a9c-9c47-b7dff90179d5-0
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:05.400
Or she's peeping around the
corner looks like to me and.

754980d5-bf82-445e-aa85-2c2f466be514-0
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.116
Oh, she grabs the key.
{Sometimes I have to look ahead

754980d5-bf82-445e-aa85-2c2f466be514-1
00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:14.480
to see what's going to happen.
OK. Is that normal?

4b252848-9faf-449e-ba4b-8cf1203cab11-0
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.324
Yes. OK, OK.} So she's grabbing
the key and unlocking the drawer

4b252848-9faf-449e-ba4b-8cf1203cab11-1
00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:28.710
that he put her book in. So she
takes her book and runs off.

e0e3cfa5-01fe-4027-83f6-10370b97bad2-0
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.320
And this picture is just her.

f30fc2e7-3739-407d-9cdc-79c7eeec1e7f-0
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.435
You know, I guess, trying to
decide where to go, she climbs

f30fc2e7-3739-407d-9cdc-79c7eeec1e7f-1
00:09:39.435 --> 00:09:42.280
into one of the box cars of the
train.

66268886-9a5c-46fa-9443-2389ad5880f0-0
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.830
And and then and then it goes.
Then the train starts moving.

b77def87-666a-4423-9a88-55269dfcf1fb-0
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.890
Hmm.

4dd9fca6-989d-4724-915c-b48685751523-0
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.940
OK, here we have a flying boat
again, I see.

75d6c72e-f224-4cb1-8844-87d6329796ec-0
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:09.140
I see buildings, pictures on top
of the buildings and.

9c29eb18-09a5-4c6b-ad95-6d47b3438458-0
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.440
Then the guy and his pet and the
girl and her pet.

1bc035a4-92f5-41ec-bc9b-51165f857741-0
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.789
And she's pointing at something.
Then the conductor says

1bc035a4-92f5-41ec-bc9b-51165f857741-1
00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.130
something and.

b0acb995-435d-4071-aa03-d0abf42f26b1-0
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.990
And then the boat is landing.

a58f65a7-d475-45e6-8ecf-b375c16bc6a6-0
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.060
He thanks her and him and his
pet walk off.

d126449d-a5bb-472b-9e7f-bb18c6872679-0
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.580
And then when and then he looks
up.

f6655646-1743-4275-ad0f-de2ab4c6fdfd-0
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.020
And what he sees is, uh

9dbf3b54-24f1-4a1a-8d04-4b3a746cc48e-0
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.610
Looks like a city. City with
people walking around Build, I

9dbf3b54-24f1-4a1a-8d04-4b3a746cc48e-1
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.460
see buildings and I see a big
giant.

26815d4e-3fff-4270-9e5c-aa284606b978-0
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.910
I don't know what that is, but
it's a statue of an animal.

80cee50b-0096-41b2-84ff-12c5d40fbae5-0
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.760
OK, so the man and the and his
pet is walking.

a02ad2c4-740e-4d2f-9a27-1cac9bb00a30-0
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:05.880
Um.

f5a376c7-f7de-4906-9882-1a8f0a73f07c-0
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.130
Then I see, uh, like a street.

58e8e08d-62f9-4eb8-b4b8-b52d5ca5d7f2-0
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.410
With everybody walking and
buildings.

647b4383-c4c8-4a94-be09-d57502c77a9e-0
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.550
And down here I'm seeing um.

7889f94f-1218-4d4d-b66a-bc59a2e629fa-0
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.679
Two people are talking and I
don't know what these are. I

7889f94f-1218-4d4d-b66a-bc59a2e629fa-1
00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:27.340
don't know if that's something
you eat or.

c719545d-1e16-4d2c-af07-36527a368993-0
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.430
Pets or what that is, but it's a
box full of something.

041729f8-6b8c-4b5b-bd56-1ff2fe4db6df-0
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.170
And then here.

512011d2-91f3-4736-9dae-730aff35eff7-0
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.389
OK, I don't know what this is.
It looks like a vending machine.

512011d2-91f3-4736-9dae-730aff35eff7-1
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:49.803
That's what it looks like to me.
OK, so then a lady. Old lady, an

512011d2-91f3-4736-9dae-730aff35eff7-2
00:11:49.803 --> 00:11:50.460
old man.

a90a20a8-0877-4047-a8c2-76b7d0969609-0
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.220
And I don't know if that's a pet
or something to eat.

3d051d2d-745d-409a-bf23-ce419797c043-0
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.610
And down here they're walking
around. The man is walking

3d051d2d-745d-409a-bf23-ce419797c043-1
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.130
around.

af2eb57d-b003-4f79-b10d-9f99fede0fcc-0
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.050
With his pet, pulls out a piece
of paper.

3e40a57e-f436-4629-ae43-e2e595c51cd4-0
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.520
Or book of some kind or
something and um.

f7883f49-3a5e-47c9-a668-d0392602d778-0
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.540
With and the book has a picture
of Apple.

20f7ce85-4ada-4a13-9854-fe1306ed3195-0
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.490
Milk jug or cheese. Bread, fish.

adf14531-0882-43cf-88e6-7016ed71d366-0
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.530
And something else.

4a6fe8be-28a0-4796-89b2-e91bf75b024d-0
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.690
And OK, so his pet is scratching
at something.

14595025-2e54-4817-a5ce-d03129dfb7b6-0
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.940
So he walks over to see what it
is.

65d36d15-e618-4d4b-bb12-3f409c5e4e87-0
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.530
He pulls out the drawer and
there's something in there and

65d36d15-e618-4d4b-bb12-3f409c5e4e87-1
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.513
then I guess he's comparing it
with to the the pictures in the

65d36d15-e618-4d4b-bb12-3f409c5e4e87-2
00:12:41.513 --> 00:12:41.829
book.

585e9c57-e534-4f63-8bc3-a9c02b268d77-0
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:48.490
OK, so he or somebody reaches
down and pulls one up.

b5a4743a-8fd4-433b-81f2-087fba09013e-0
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.910
And and here it turned out to be
a little boy.

7569f9f0-82b3-4a3c-be14-f58aa29fdd09-0
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:02.150
And the little boy and an older
man are waving at him. He's

7569f9f0-82b3-4a3c-be14-f58aa29fdd09-1
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.240
offering this thing to the man.

1f349de7-b490-425b-9012-d4133a4e53c7-0
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.737
Something edible, I'm assuming,
and the man points at the bread.

1f349de7-b490-425b-9012-d4133a4e53c7-1
00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:13.920
I guess that's what he wants, so
he's asking him.

a1586003-810b-4c2d-9f21-3d20c7a102f4-0
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.513
Probably asking him where can I
get bread. So the man shows him

a1586003-810b-4c2d-9f21-3d20c7a102f4-1
00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:21.600
on the wall.

e23f4919-b72b-4c7e-8d8b-6b08b0a70a46-0
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.970
Which one it is and then he
opens it up and pulls out.

e4a2b0f7-4133-4ac5-a029-0f4231c7b196-0
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.343
Something. Then he gives it to
the man. The man drinks or eats

e4a2b0f7-4133-4ac5-a029-0f4231c7b196-1
00:13:35.343 --> 00:13:40.405
from it. And then the boy has a
basket and he gives it to the

e4a2b0f7-4133-4ac5-a029-0f4231c7b196-2
00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:42.610
man. Now he has the basket.

9154946f-9888-408d-a5ca-c4ccd3da9c4b-0
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:50.946
OK, so now the older man man
with the glasses is holding

9154946f-9888-408d-a5ca-c4ccd3da9c4b-1
00:13:50.946 --> 00:13:54.420
something, look like shrimp to
me.

709929ee-e60a-4560-94df-735e31154c80-0
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.360
And the boy is holding.

6e0d46ff-8f65-44d2-85d3-0c612fc20c47-0
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.450
Something, I don't know what
that is.

2a8aea15-e7ad-4647-98a7-ccac75422862-0
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.520
And now the man is eating
something. I see a plant.

a7740dd4-8a18-4656-87eb-3ce810cb227b-0
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.230
The boy is holding something.

887400b7-6c8a-4466-9f1c-9e5ffacc1349-0
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.480
Uh, and here.

3523f60e-07f5-4de5-8a08-dc2722126e01-0
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.170
Somebody is holding.

9116761f-75ba-4234-9466-0f7551e1241f-0
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.391
Something, I don't know what
that is. And then here he's

9116761f-75ba-4234-9466-0f7551e1241f-1
00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:27.520
holding a snake.

98f2d651-74fc-4aff-b82f-b85acc62946a-0
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.820
Looks like.

d4511977-b897-48b6-839a-8f0dee8ec220-0
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.560
And then he's got a stomach and
he's holding a fish.

c0eec5fe-5c6c-4c9b-8cdf-fa81f5a6e760-0
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.880
Man on this one looks like some
type of fruit.

d0cebe9c-1a3e-41cd-bc06-6be9b6b94328-0
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.866
And the boy's eating something,
eating what he was offering to

d0cebe9c-1a3e-41cd-bc06-6be9b6b94328-1
00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:51.269
the man. The man takes a bite of
the fruit. The boy gives uh what

d0cebe9c-1a3e-41cd-bc06-6be9b6b94328-2
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:54.380
he was eating, some of it to the
pet.

9467ac90-b36e-43f4-9aed-6c657374730d-0
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.920
And down here now, he has a
basket full of everything.

ff0c5b9d-1824-4fb6-9bed-42be9370b038-0
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:07.156
And the boy is whispering
something to the eyeglass guy,

ff0c5b9d-1824-4fb6-9bed-42be9370b038-1
00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:13.761
and eyeglass guy is talking to I
see two baskets full of food.

ff0c5b9d-1824-4fb6-9bed-42be9370b038-2
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:19.843
They're talking to each other.
The boy is pet pointing at

ff0c5b9d-1824-4fb6-9bed-42be9370b038-3
00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:21.939
something. And then.

b49a9c3b-5c91-4ff6-a1dc-e81d92220fec-0
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:29.410
The three of them and the man's
pet is carrying baskets and

b49a9c3b-5c91-4ff6-a1dc-e81d92220fec-1
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.060
walking to a boat.

fe53d6b3-4420-4872-8815-01ab42d72861-0
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.550
OK, so the boy is getting ready
to get on a boat.

d87e277e-0866-4e05-8656-d6d4aa779e68-0
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.380
And the man's pet is with him.

04d9a213-3aea-49a3-acdd-fed15dbcdba7-0
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:53.701
Then the boy is, I guess,
reaching down into some vase

04d9a213-3aea-49a3-acdd-fed15dbcdba7-1
00:15:53.701 --> 00:15:59.070
that was already on the boat and
something comes up.

4ed8af21-8283-42a8-86f8-4f8028ffc218-0
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:08.970
And then the man is afraid. He
drops his basket and.

e11eeec5-fdc2-4591-a3d3-14d2911aa6ed-0
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.280
I think the boy is laughing at
him.

da6c56db-c5ed-4caf-a311-88d1cc67cd16-0
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.820
And then the other guy is
comforting him.

1b8acaeb-5527-425a-bdef-26a05abf96a3-0
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.011
And then he's, I guess,
explaining to him what it is.

1b8acaeb-5527-425a-bdef-26a05abf96a3-1
00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:25.040
It's coming out of the vase.

7ebb71b7-afb7-44bf-8999-518500ed0d37-0
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.920
And the boy is holding.

21ee17aa-cd46-4b6f-85ac-566fb91cde1c-0
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:35.180
Some kind of animal looks like a
cat in the vase. OK, so.

693cfca9-35a7-4e26-9c79-932b30ffa7c0-0
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.480
So now here he is holding the
cat.

eb82b0c7-51eb-4278-bcd2-686e25bfc657-0
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.180
And he.

f3fdb7f8-9600-46b0-81c5-676d0e9dfe89-0
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.340
Lets the man pet him.

8e38dcea-0d89-42b5-99e6-2cf87e5c16cf-0
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:52.071
Then the other guy's pointing
this pointing and the boy's

8e38dcea-0d89-42b5-99e6-2cf87e5c16cf-1
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:55.720
pointing and the man's pet and
the cat.

23bcc43d-8836-4c0e-ae64-60449a4d411d-0
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.780
Are getting along, getting to
know each other anyway.

ed79a7fa-c0e6-4331-9235-bd48ca10a46a-0
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.890
So here they continue to get to
know each other. The.

afa92019-78d1-468c-9750-1427e43e4339-0
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.220
The man and the boy, I guess.

6c92a9c0-4f6b-497e-adc1-95e8876d7794-0
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:19.733
Um, are picking up his his food
because he dropped his basket

6c92a9c0-4f6b-497e-adc1-95e8876d7794-1
00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:20.190
and.

8f59ed1f-a316-49b8-9aae-469c8f8cf0dc-0
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:27.380
And then the two men are
talking. The other guy is.

cb9f0ee6-eb40-4da1-afc2-40de7b219df6-0
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.969
Looks like he's asking a
question and then now he's

cb9f0ee6-eb40-4da1-afc2-40de7b219df6-1
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.540
writing something down.

2e063a80-63cd-471d-a64c-718d1775724d-0
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.741
And he' making drawing
something, drawing houses. OK,

2e063a80-63cd-471d-a64c-718d1775724d-1
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:40.490
so then.

a03d689b-80fd-4c95-b676-a0a91469ee41-0
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.990
He shows it to the man.

382a38dd-8973-45c3-8038-13df98229b90-0
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.400
The man is.

6baf8f56-b8a1-4a2a-a9cf-77ea2b548180-0
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.733
I don't know, in all of it, it
looks like. #END_arrival_5 OK,

6baf8f56-b8a1-4a2a-a9cf-77ea2b548180-1
00:17:53.733 --> 00:17:56.910
that's it. OK, so that was the
story.

f41088e2-af83-4ad8-8e2b-97160baac11b-0
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.660
So the next one is just one page
complex scene. OK, go.

Dinosaurs.

d432a396-0cb1-4669-9d54-1908b75fd209-0
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.560
