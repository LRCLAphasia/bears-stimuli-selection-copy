00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.213
OK, so you were about to look at
a series of pictures that tell a

35b38417-b94f-4557-818b-9bfc714a9525-1
00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:11.230
story. Imagine you were telling
the story to someone who cannot

35b38417-b94f-4557-818b-9bfc714a9525-2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.248
see the pictures. I'm going to
ask you to describe what you see

35b38417-b94f-4557-818b-9bfc714a9525-3
00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.450
and what is happening as you go
through the story.

55175357-388c-4c85-a4a1-76248e747899-0
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.948
This story, let me see and we
ask that you tell it in between

55175357-388c-4c85-a4a1-76248e747899-1
00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:32.160
10 to 15 minutes, I'm going to
pull up the slides for the first

55175357-388c-4c85-a4a1-76248e747899-2
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.490
story there, right here.

4d13b95f-0ddb-49a4-9ab9-47d042f612b5-0
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.336
So this story is approximate is
20 slides. When you're done

4d13b95f-0ddb-49a4-9ab9-47d042f612b5-1
00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:44.600
describing one page, you could
tell me to move on to the next

4d13b95f-0ddb-49a4-9ab9-47d042f612b5-2
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.420
page and I will click through
the story.

0ac6c2f0-1b39-4d55-aea9-e4d8682746bf-0
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.600
OK, that sounds good and I will
put this in a present mode.

0dd05bde-b5d0-4c16-aff6-15fd198dec59-0
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.140
OK.

aeffd7c5-9ee4-4c59-86cf-807069bc6a65-0
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.120
Great.

a07a1260-c0bc-45d7-af90-4aab4c5d2087-0
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.330
And you could start when you're
ready and I'll have a timer.

059b34df-68d5-4df3-b12f-f007ebdd343f-0
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.430
I'm not able to read this.

13e93ca7-7b76-4757-81d5-da5b475919c0-0
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.330
Oh.

aac7a3cb-e055-4142-8ca9-9ba8b3ca57f1-0
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.630
Yeah, the print is very light,
you don't need to.

2ffdac83-d841-456b-b31d-f99d48abd3c3-0
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.090
There's these are wordless
picture books. That's just

2ffdac83-d841-456b-b31d-f99d48abd3c3-1
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.270
something about the author's
writing, like a acknowledgement.

2ffdac83-d841-456b-b31d-f99d48abd3c3-2
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.900
So just describe the pictures
you see.

e71d7350-c922-43fd-ab4c-97e05c2ee9f8-0
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.690
OK, great. So.

646bb458-1f99-427c-9638-1149d6481f15-0
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.690
#START_quest I see a park bench
and a beautiful stone sculpture

646bb458-1f99-427c-9638-1149d6481f15-1
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.157
of maybe a Roman God on the
entrance to the park. There's a

646bb458-1f99-427c-9638-1149d6481f15-2
00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:44.170
lamp and it's apparently raining
and it does look like it's fall.

7d9c3a07-15cf-4302-96b3-952a5b0e7fac-0
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.330
Then the next photo is showing.

ec78ab2c-8712-4468-afd9-60f87a8a82e2-0
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.108
The entrance to the park and
there's there's a bridge, a

ec78ab2c-8712-4468-afd9-60f87a8a82e2-1
00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:59.317
stone bridge over the entrance,
and there are two children,

ec78ab2c-8712-4468-afd9-60f87a8a82e2-2
00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:00.620
maybe 10 or 12.

284dbefa-3d12-4525-be72-a16b09cd1aa3-0
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.100
Inside there, waiting for the
rain to stop, it looks like and.

1f452bfc-7458-4947-8161-21ccf69dfcf9-0
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.400
There's a bike with two seats.

2bc39154-d1eb-4e04-aecb-2fb6a26108a8-0
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.900
Very nice bike.

dc956f81-4660-40ca-8fd9-8c8c1cb016b6-0
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.756
And I could see another statue.
Oh, so there's a God and a

dc956f81-4660-40ca-8fd9-8c8c1cb016b6-1
00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:21.147
mermaid. It's definitely a City
Park. And then beyond that I see

dc956f81-4660-40ca-8fd9-8c8c1cb016b6-2
00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:23.580
another God, maybe Buddha,
sitting.

7ef65c17-5e6d-4911-a43e-cba249c73a2b-0
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.787
There's lamps and benches. It's
it looks like it's in a

7ef65c17-5e6d-4911-a43e-cba249c73a2b-1
00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:27.430
beautiful city.

e4ba648d-d7f0-4f59-8ae0-877d5d3dc904-0
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.460
{OK.

75d0e772-6a16-42df-9105-49479776c0f2-0
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.310
Would you like me to?

314e1342-e0ad-4c71-9986-d9709adad4ec-0
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.950
Yes. OK. We can go forward.
Thanks.}

d750018c-ba03-40eb-9400-7d268f8d6310-0
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.629
All righty. Oh, and the doors,
the wooden doors under that

d750018c-ba03-40eb-9400-7d268f8d6310-1
00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.510
bridge, which I saw but didn't
describe open and.

c11b4a4b-4825-41e2-b0e3-1985333df0a4-0
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.130
a very unusual.

bf3388ac-e11e-40e1-942c-bf3813f704b1-0
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.510
Character comes out wearing a
crown and antique garments.

4d406201-7fca-46b2-aaa0-efdd3a272393-0
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.022
Showing a scroll with the scroll
unrolled, showing it to the boy

4d406201-7fca-46b2-aaa0-efdd3a272393-1
00:03:00.022 --> 00:03:02.910
and the girl. Now I can see that
it's a boy and a girl.

716f9998-b0b6-467b-a01e-76dd8fe0eed6-0
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.870
And it looks as though.

b8a9b53b-f9fa-4b7c-9210-3f182a12b480-0
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.166
A purple bird with a very long
tail has probably come out with

b8a9b53b-f9fa-4b7c-9210-3f182a12b480-1
00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:14.220
that king. Will call him the
king.

b18a9b8c-aa83-4d8d-90fb-127dfcdad5c3-0
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.880
Fantasy King and.

6b4ce024-1e06-45d6-b131-1d26ebcb1d3c-0
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.310
From there we go.

dd2204b6-5e56-4b6c-bc91-0c257df1dac8-0
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.170
To smaller ones, all right.

4fdfc458-225b-4be3-b4b1-7f586a9d26cc-0
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.360
There we go, and.

97bbb150-d0cd-4c40-9813-96d3e0af4440-0
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.335
The boy is reading the scroll
with the bird on his shoulder.

97bbb150-d0cd-4c40-9813-96d3e0af4440-1
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.370
The king appears to be giving.

de5c6520-240e-4767-9f4e-3b616d34c33b-0
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.812
Something to the girl it's it's
an orange stick or something

de5c6520-240e-4767-9f4e-3b616d34c33b-1
00:03:37.812 --> 00:03:39.270
like that. A wand, perhaps?

92b4fd4b-b823-4761-9656-df24b3c31b33-0
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.424
But then a knight of some kind
comes out and grabs the king. A

92b4fd4b-b823-4761-9656-df24b3c31b33-1
00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:50.259
knight with a spear. Two knights
with Spears come out and grab

92b4fd4b-b823-4761-9656-df24b3c31b33-2
00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.950
the king.

6004091c-f80f-496c-80e4-a582da5a424c-0
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.412
And take him back inside, but
the scroll, the wand and the

6004091c-f80f-496c-80e4-a582da5a424c-1
00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:57.310
bird remain.

528c6f63-2528-4feb-b03c-33e86b1a40f2-0
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.740
With the kids. So yeah, ready
for the next one.

0f64c94a-dcbd-43a7-ae9c-a5ea68ee5b51-0
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.540
And the door is shut.

2bbfa03b-044e-4644-baa6-a15639571f45-0
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.560
Door's shut. Ohh, the girl's
wearing.

f35d159f-d182-4294-8b3f-6f84c77c5c2d-0
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.864
A belt, which could be the
King's belt, not too sure. Oh,

f35d159f-d182-4294-8b3f-6f84c77c5c2d-1
00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:19.075
it's ammunition. She's got not
just the red, but the orange.

f35d159f-d182-4294-8b3f-6f84c77c5c2d-2
00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:20.870
And then there's a purple.

ea70c951-d014-4e9d-8258-526b550d14c5-0
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.688
So it looks as though there were
some kind of wands in the belt,

ea70c951-d014-4e9d-8258-526b550d14c5-1
00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:27.220
which she's wearing now.

108a8b1d-9f4f-402f-bd78-0481697a2325-0
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.710
The boy has the bird and the
scroll and one of them.

de575e62-115d-4d5b-9a90-ce0c5ce006f3-0
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.260
OK, so very interesting. She's.

97791ace-7af9-4ca9-910f-bc870300916e-0
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.840
Got ohh.

f5ab3703-2959-46a5-9943-2338d06e668b-0
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.842
Keys. They find keys. OK, so
they each have a key. They each

f5ab3703-2959-46a5-9943-2338d06e668b-1
00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:45.590
have a key.

c59e6b7e-3213-4c9a-809f-5dea9662bc50-0
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.620
And they.

184c1b27-60f9-4700-92ef-330d3f2b8346-0
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.442
Acknowledge that the bird is
watching everything. He's very

184c1b27-60f9-4700-92ef-330d3f2b8346-1
00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:56.380
intent. And lo and behold, the
keys unlock the door and they go

184c1b27-60f9-4700-92ef-330d3f2b8346-2
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.550
running through it.

42fb44b0-c604-441f-8ec3-698c4d626304-0
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.490
OK. The next one.

e8afd350-e305-4624-a21f-d118abaebeed-0
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.010
Wow, they.

b2ca5c96-cdd7-4b52-b7bc-a2cf858455e8-0
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.960
Come out into a Moat surrounding
a castle.

2cc0001f-3053-449f-83c1-3a386c091672-0
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.930
Huge castle and they can see
ahead of them a barge.

6a3bd533-7013-4912-965f-3fd2744553ed-0
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.280
The beautiful.

03c5ff97-448c-4221-b63c-d2be92d9014d-0
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.420
Paddle wheel, a paddle wheel
barge.

ae82c326-4193-478b-b0bb-62d56cebaef5-0
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.290
It's an army barge full of
soldiers and they have the king

ae82c326-4193-478b-b0bb-62d56cebaef5-1
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.990
as prisoner.

30373320-3bdf-4369-a25b-d49876c97ba0-0
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.060
There's a lot of activity in the
castles and.

05c2a2f2-77cf-4449-9136-bc131803ad4a-0
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.970
There are very interesting.

c9b20615-bd35-4343-a718-e684f2c1d999-0
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.243
Balloon type flying vehicles in
the air and it looks as though

c9b20615-bd35-4343-a718-e684f2c1d999-1
00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:47.563
it's in a mountain range and
with a flowing water into the

c9b20615-bd35-4343-a718-e684f2c1d999-2
00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:47.929
Moat.

e6ea95c0-d38d-4a85-acb9-af520cc71e69-0
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.110
Very interesting. OK, I should
can see the next one. Thanks.

73a313bb-c1d4-4c2f-8e51-d7a664a74ffb-0
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.230
Ohh, it turns out that they have
a map.

e3877718-a9c5-4445-917f-6ba0242e8e29-0
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.598
So they've gotten in there
without being detected. The boy

e3877718-a9c5-4445-917f-6ba0242e8e29-1
00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:04.930
and the girl with the bird and
the map.

345bcd39-754f-438c-a3a3-94e13f0b6c88-0
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.680
And there's a close up of the
map.

3bd9ea2a-5b41-41a0-9fd2-8445cfef320d-0
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.640
And it looks as though

4242c740-3f49-43e3-baa8-44157ccc952a-0
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.740
They're in the castle.

9bcb3e7e-c17c-4c7b-9fd4-d706dc166314-0
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.130
Wow, very complex.

371b432c-5443-40ca-8b02-2b7d0a782686-0
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.000
Looks OK. The next one.

dae5382f-e6f9-44bb-b526-3810a2dbcc2f-0
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.030
The boy and the girl are hiding
to keep from being detected.

08a6b872-94f3-461a-8afe-3d089a40b5d1-0
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.640
And there are.

26db314a-a38c-46b3-8320-d2d8706d3fb9-0
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.710
Boats with soldiers in them and
I think they're searching.

02b48134-26b6-41cd-b9cf-d2a2cba76da9-0
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.100
For the boy and the girl and the
bird.

12ee5c71-f278-478e-b45e-54181de13aaf-0
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.050
They think they may be under a
waterfall.

88047db1-7ecb-4323-be0b-7a5a6cc8354c-0
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.980
Alright.

888d6ac2-9c3d-4bcf-a259-eef30a1f1b80-0
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.679
Somehow they have flippers
swimming flippers on and they've

888d6ac2-9c3d-4bcf-a259-eef30a1f1b80-1
00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:57.424
decided the way to survive this
predicament is to dive into the

888d6ac2-9c3d-4bcf-a259-eef30a1f1b80-2
00:06:57.424 --> 00:07:00.020
water and the bird goes with
them.

3c4b382f-3830-417f-ae06-9f05f0867560-0
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.680
Oh, no, there's an octopus. Oh,
yes, the bird. There's an

3c4b382f-3830-417f-ae06-9f05f0867560-1
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.455
octopus. OK, I'm ready. Thanks.
Yeah, there's an octopus that's

3c4b382f-3830-417f-ae06-9f05f0867560-2
00:07:08.455 --> 00:07:08.750
come.

7c01a236-4408-4ac3-8a51-88ac422c1f9b-0
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.725
An octopus or a ray of some kind
and all of a sudden they don't

7c01a236-4408-4ac3-8a51-88ac422c1f9b-1
00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:18.880
just have flippers on, they've
got their their divers' helmets.

35c01907-eb70-42d4-ad53-bb1a8ceef1fe-0
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.030
Bird has some swimming equipment
too.

d48636d7-61bd-49ed-bde2-3f6c662cbfe9-0
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.390
They're in an underwater city, a
very ornate city.

3a67f7f1-0a89-4627-8f52-fda4d532b4df-0
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.570
OK, next one.

38cffe45-954d-4f63-987d-d1e9e547a2a0-0
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.120
Yes, so they found.

8a43ba97-b0e2-4a50-9d25-a57ec571955a-0
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.650
An altar

314a3ff9-7139-4089-86f9-0a43e4ae38b5-0
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.850
in a little sunken temple area,
I'm guessing.

9b1c9489-15e3-4c7b-b9ba-485286afaa67-0
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.450
And they're using their wand.

4a42394e-73d8-4084-b6c6-c5627633fb52-0
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.210
Girl is using her wand.

9d99e414-9ab5-4b14-98eb-1d4788a6f02f-0
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.100
Putting it on that.

b2b72073-f2e7-458e-b651-21cbc35ac9a4-0
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.730
On that spot, meanwhile.

c3c1241b-d6df-4566-bc6b-916d1ba42196-0
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.952
Down come the guards, and
they're equipped for swimming

c3c1241b-d6df-4566-bc6b-916d1ba42196-1
00:08:01.952 --> 00:08:05.019
underwater too, so they've got
to stay ahead of things. But

c3c1241b-d6df-4566-bc6b-916d1ba42196-2
00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.188
they're grasping the octopus's.
That is an octopus that looks

c3c1241b-d6df-4566-bc6b-916d1ba42196-3
00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:09.160
like the octopus's.

9be001ba-987d-4a7d-a1ed-26a30a7c5dd3-0
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.112
Tail ends, or whatever you call
those things and they are using

9be001ba-987d-4a7d-a1ed-26a30a7c5dd3-1
00:08:14.112 --> 00:08:14.470
the map.

0831ac0e-d392-43e7-ac00-c3067014097a-0
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.560
OK.

cc22b9f2-f67a-44c5-b5c8-20d52117e7ab-0
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.285
Ok they come out on a tropical
island full of palm trees and it

cc22b9f2-f67a-44c5-b5c8-20d52117e7ab-1
00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:26.110
was exactly where they intended
to go.

ce3f718a-50b0-42ea-9025-e2a14c8dc042-0
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.670
Evidently it's one of the stops
on their map.

cbf08644-6d28-4778-8c95-ffce839b1cad-0
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.110
And they're.

afedb1ee-0895-4fec-9780-231e653dc24b-0
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.360
drawing in some way, they're
drawing.

d5ab0632-1808-4b07-819c-132e447b187f-0
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.791
Something or other map is
clutched. They're keeping

d5ab0632-1808-4b07-819c-132e447b187f-1
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:43.490
everything.

7678716d-4c4f-4f67-9808-7805ca54267c-0
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.160
That's val of value and the bird
is still with them, OK.

200a83c5-0589-4f86-a7f4-b0e66947e8a3-0
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.100
I can see the next one please.

14b90b2f-5aa4-43f1-bbaa-07cf8c43762b-0
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.340
Yeah, OK, they've drawn. I don't
understand why they were

14b90b2f-5aa4-43f1-bbaa-07cf8c43762b-1
00:08:59.340 --> 00:08:59.840
drawing.

6d6d0279-a509-462d-8134-45aa5628ab3a-0
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.590
But Oh yeah, I do. They drew
themselves a rhinoceros.

89f253c4-05f8-46da-b710-a11540767c29-0
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.800
To be their transportation on
this island.

52fe4a95-8fc3-4786-9155-229bbedb12df-0
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.669
And it's a remarkable looking
place with some very ancient

52fe4a95-8fc3-4786-9155-229bbedb12df-1
00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:16.510
buildings on it.

2b0df709-98a6-421f-a58a-a66359dab00b-0
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.072
A lot of palm trees and some
kind of an aqueduct maybe? I'm

2b0df709-98a6-421f-a58a-a66359dab00b-1
00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:23.000
not sure what.

187a3bd5-99bd-49bc-9af1-b4ac970ba8ed-0
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.480
OK, next one.

1cb81106-8ade-4332-8c5d-a48e97edbb70-0
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.250
Oh, it's a walkway.

edc657e5-379f-4ee6-ab57-6ff3c79ff18f-0
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.620
To a tower of some kind in the
Bay.

01e2f6be-68a3-46fb-83d9-5ca123361fc6-0
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.420
It's almost a lighthouse.
There's a light on its tower.

02b35195-09e7-4a2c-b282-e95a08c925de-0
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.350
The birds showing them the way
it looks like.

7056d697-35da-4981-b229-434f5739d531-0
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.780
Thanks. We can go to the next
one.

d7341d50-a661-4d28-a1d3-03a8f0820067-0
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.972
OK, so they reach the tower and
the soldiers are coming after

d7341d50-a661-4d28-a1d3-03a8f0820067-1
00:09:52.972 --> 00:09:53.440
them.

e091066a-5a74-4fef-aac7-aa19dd632103-0
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.040
And they continue to draw what
they need, apparently.

979c2a21-b749-4847-a283-0800f30881e5-0
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:02.220
Uh

19a20ee4-d542-4874-947c-798bde48a4e1-0
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.050
Next one.

5956c793-6392-4cac-8de6-4925a22d5273-0
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.360
Oh gosh. Oh, they draw a swing.

d6dde432-5205-4df5-8dc2-477d3a44d8c8-0
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.030
Which almost gets them captured.

97c16d12-b4a7-48a4-9849-ca26de6fc5c6-0
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.840
Bird is turned into a.

cad641b5-541c-4294-9cf7-f3560407558b-0
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.850
Dragonfly.

2c1495d6-4faa-4e4e-87ac-30af61ed8017-0
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.358
Oh no, no, a dragon. The
dragonfly. OK, a dragonfly is

2c1495d6-4faa-4e4e-87ac-30af61ed8017-1
00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:25.410
their swing.

50f58840-f0e0-45c8-9bac-84075601bd60-0
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.963
And it takes them to another
location. They're managing to

50f58840-f0e0-45c8-9bac-84075601bd60-1
00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:34.977
stay ahead of the soldiers who
are now are in those flying

50f58840-f0e0-45c8-9bac-84075601bd60-2
00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:35.590
vehicles.

830292b0-aa07-47bb-ac60-f8514707cc40-0
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.380
And they have their belt with
all their tools in it.

36b9ef04-d0d1-45d0-8eb4-c178f90610b4-0
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.860
They go from one top to another.
Thanks. OK, so now they're.

38c1edc5-fa48-4aaf-9f7b-da2925c56548-0
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.060
They're being approached by the
soldiers.

6569ca9f-964c-4b9e-8297-e1e97d77241d-0
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.370
in a number of flying vessels.

6ebe11ce-a99f-42c4-b952-d3ff79a0ae31-0
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.070
Ornate.

f8d1ee33-b54c-4569-ac51-4ef19c29f681-0
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.100
Ornate destination. They're on
the Spire again, OK.

fd69db57-d09a-4ace-ad61-4db73c7fe163-0
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.440
Next.

aaa7063a-9064-4759-a3f9-2bc5daf7ff56-0
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.200
Oh

a24a0dff-3da9-4a4c-b0f9-8f42009c3b9e-0
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.110
And a rainbow appears.

8ad6e952-dbd4-4263-8b04-44eacda5cb4c-0
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.980
It's flown out of the belt they
were carrying.

fda201fe-4024-4504-ae98-326260781339-0
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.380
Each of those wands has created
a color bridge in the rainbow.

1a876495-aa9f-4391-bec1-ead3cc2611de-0
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.915
Just as the soldiers are coming
in closer and look like they

1a876495-aa9f-4391-bec1-ead3cc2611de-1
00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:21.950
could be captured.

c87d09c7-6f3c-4cd6-9a2b-5378821b1f38-0
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.670
OK, next one.

0ae05629-f34b-4ec0-a0f1-9739d51a000c-0
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.961
Rainbow. What the heck are they?
I'm losing sight of the boy and

0ae05629-f34b-4ec0-a0f1-9739d51a000c-1
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:33.630
the girl.

8d37ac7a-98cc-45a6-8aaa-4f864776775e-0
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.760
On the rainbow I see the bird.

ca04b91e-898e-438d-bb87-19efdc1b1a35-0
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:46.790
Hmm. OK, I think I see the boy
and girl better go to the next

ca04b91e-898e-438d-bb87-19efdc1b1a35-1
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.420
page. They've landed in a boat.

2be2e940-6e4d-48a1-9d30-f038101cc5c7-0
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.420
Yeah, their rhino is in the
boat. Rhino is in the boat.

46b91042-e4a9-4b81-8761-db1384ad7aca-0
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.007
City. They've arrived in the
city that maybe that appears to

46b91042-e4a9-4b81-8761-db1384ad7aca-1
00:12:04.007 --> 00:12:05.110
be welcoming them.

371aab3c-0334-4d47-be83-420217f98262-0
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.072
Very interesting. The bird is
still with them. All their sav

371aab3c-0334-4d47-be83-420217f98262-1
00:12:12.072 --> 00:12:16.177
their savior animals are purple:
the quetzal bird, that's what I

371aab3c-0334-4d47-be83-420217f98262-2
00:12:16.177 --> 00:12:20.156
think it is, the octopus and the
rhinoceros. Very interesting.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:24.009
And they're in a parade. All
right. Do they're they're being

371aab3c-0334-4d47-be83-420217f98262-4
00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:25.020
greeted. Thanks.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.070
Oh, it's the king. He's welcomed
them.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.460
To this.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.510
This new city.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.320
And he's thanking them.

b00d9660-ea9a-40e6-8665-db7aa6b515aa-0
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.740
He's giving them crowns and
thanking them.

85b95130-6efb-4f2f-a839-8bace264aaf8-0
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.360
And they're heading back through
the doorway.

b3acb239-4f53-4fb3-b322-26558f720af6-0
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.900
OK. And?

abacee2e-f5e5-410a-9c84-0fe144cfa3f5-0
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.588
The rainbow ahead of them as
they leave the tunnel into the

abacee2e-f5e5-410a-9c84-0fe144cfa3f5-1
00:12:54.588 --> 00:12:56.580
park where they started.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.144
They're still accompanied by the
bird and they're wearing their

00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:03.210
crowns, carrying their tools.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.530
OK.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.760
OK, so that was an example of
like what the stories are like.

ec5f5128-0f98-4aad-9ef9-6405da4151e4-1
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.010
Let's see what you have next.

5842364f-f2a7-48e0-bd57-531d61c6df69-0
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.970
OK, next we actually have a
complex scene. I'll pull up.

cc55605e-b6a5-42a9-afa4-c90048be6472-0
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.610
The directions for complex
scene.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.640
OK.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.239
OK, so you are about to see a
complex scene. Imagine you are

602e3446-ae76-4ce2-9ede-6355c874c92b-1
00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:52.351
describing the scene to someone
who cannot see the picture.

602e3446-ae76-4ce2-9ede-6355c874c92b-2
00:13:52.351 --> 00:13:56.531
Describe what is happening and
what you see in this scene as

00:13:56.531 --> 00:14:00.985
thoroughly as possible, and for
scenes it's a little shorter. So

602e3446-ae76-4ce2-9ede-6355c874c92b-4
00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:04.480
it's around three to five
minutes. And now I will.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.470
Pull up the scene.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.400
So.

8fa6f507-865d-4a4f-ac98-a49166b6d167-0
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.896
Did I do 10 minutes in the last
one? Yeah, you did. Yeah. It was

8fa6f507-865d-4a4f-ac98-a49166b6d167-1
00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:27.750
very timely. I'm very impressed.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.450
That's good to know, and then
I'll put this in a.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.250
And I wish I were on a laptop.
I've got my iPad.

97d2fb4b-72fa-45dd-90bf-c62a9ffa90ed-0
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.410
#START_wild_west So Yep, I can
see it. It's a wild, Wild West.

8aa4675e-bc83-45ea-a057-0b703800e154-0
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.790
Alright, so.

97982654-2749-41c1-97f6-828d51073b5d-0
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.193
Who would have known the wild
Wild West was so heavily

00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:58.050
populated?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.310
And as we know.

4d2071bf-a9ec-4f79-9786-b8fd8712fc47-0
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.420
There are saloons and hotels and
jails.

c705440f-44be-456b-9898-f350c442aadd-0
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.010
It looks as though the Pioneer
saloon may be the most famous.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.090
There's a livery unstable.

cd8b76a5-3da1-47ff-896d-ac3ac420c61f-0
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.710
So there's.

b97f6270-aee7-445b-a058-a48e315111d3-0
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.200
a livery, of course, there has
to be places for all these.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.810
Characters, and there are
hundreds of them in this photo.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.951
There has to be places for them
to store their horses while

ec433101-27dc-4c5a-b348-64166782f2d4-1
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:31.800
they're in town.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.634
{I can't quite read. OK, here we
go. Wild, wild, west yeehaw,

00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:41.390
Waldo watchers. Oh, it's where?
Where's Waldo?

87632662-632f-4434-8bca-b640ff0bc133-0
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.404
Have you ever seen such a wild,
wild Western? Here comes the

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:51.959
wagon train. Ohh gosh. Steaming
into town. The gold rush. It's a

87632662-632f-4434-8bca-b640ff0bc133-2
00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.883
gold rush. Oh my gosh. Of
course. That's why there's so

87632662-632f-4434-8bca-b640ff0bc133-3
00:15:55.883 --> 00:16:00.087
many people. This is taking
place in Northern California in

87632662-632f-4434-8bca-b640ff0bc133-4
00:16:00.087 --> 00:16:03.941
1849 forward. And it's
interesting because my birthday

87632662-632f-4434-8bca-b640ff0bc133-5
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:07.935
was 1949 and my grandfather
wrote a poem about the Wild,

87632662-632f-4434-8bca-b640ff0bc133-6
00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:12.489
Wild West and the gold rush when
I was born.} Oh, and there are.

e9387a52-0bdf-46dd-93d4-5ba853082fc8-0
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.240
Umm.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.010
Buffalo stamps or something or
other so Buffalo.

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-0
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.412
Were the most classic American
animal at that point. So they're

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-1
00:16:25.412 --> 00:16:28.920
being represented there in some
way. Saloon. Saloon. Hotel,

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-2
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.312
hotel, it looks. Oh, there's
gunshots. You can see that's

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-3
00:16:32.312 --> 00:16:35.938
happening. I haven't found Waldo
yet because I don't remember

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-4
00:16:35.938 --> 00:16:39.329
exactly what he looks like. Oh,
there he is. He's got the

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-5
00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:42.604
striped hat. OK, I'm looking for
Waldo. There's so many

94fb959f-34c5-40db-8f01-499dd269eddb-6
00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:44.299

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.580
Maids and Cowboys galore.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.800

be.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.440
Very intent on doing whatever
and they're.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.033
Using ladders to get to this
complex one layer to another in

aab1ed9e-3563-4d70-8125-b258e44efa19-1
00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:05.330
this complex town.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.320
You know that I'm supposed to be
finding Waldo.

9b9ba1d6-7bcc-495f-847f-c2cf4a6592db-0
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.433
And it would be very interesting
to see what part of this crazy

9b9ba1d6-7bcc-495f-847f-c2cf4a6592db-1
00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:18.390
gold Rush town.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.860
He's decided to.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.580
hide in.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.100
A lot of guns drawn, train's
come into town.

6183f413-72c7-4aa8-939e-d74e2cddc99a-0
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.880
That he's somewhere near the
Buffalo stamps.

ff1db5b3-4fed-4b58-9377-0a8a926194c6-0
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.286
{Do I need to find Waldo? You
know, just describe what you

00:17:43.286 --> 00:17:43.590
see.}

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.665
And it looks like there's a
whole lot of drinking going on.

c8d149a6-1723-4957-b71d-5f75e643581c-1
00:17:50.665 --> 00:17:54.631
Everyone's in from the mind.
#END_wild_west Yep, that's it.

c8d149a6-1723-4957-b71d-5f75e643581c-2
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:55.160
Perfect.

OK, next we have. Let me check.

780a1926-3b12-4fe0-8669-510ef8243c5f-0
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.050
Next, we have another short
story.

7a4c30ef-ec54-48bd-b4b0-a24cbc17ff21-0
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.600
I'm gonna share my screen.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.410
OK, so this is approximately.

fc0de327-e3a2-4374-a661-de3111fceffa-0
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.012
Five slides describe what you
see in like. Let me know when to

fc0de327-e3a2-4374-a661-de3111fceffa-1
00:18:32.012 --> 00:18:32.680
move on.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.310
Alrighty, there's.

8366470f-7234-432e-af65-96e781a777f4-0
00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.182
#START_arrival_1 There's a
photo, I'm guessing, an old

8366470f-7234-432e-af65-96e781a777f4-1
00:18:42.182 --> 00:18:46.000
photo. It could be a painting on
a hanging on a wall of the.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:52.616
A mother, a father, and a young
girl. And then the hand comes in

ef7f299f-296c-4945-acc7-8b61d483883b-1
00:18:52.616 --> 00:18:57.155
to take it off the wall. Oh my
goodness. And it's getting

00:18:57.155 --> 00:19:00.520
wrapped in fabric for protection
in paper.

dd0b6c63-682f-42b6-b972-e541d9537727-0
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:07.590
And it's being wrapped and then
tied securely with a string.

e507ce0b-502e-41e9-9b2b-93f3014bc3cc-0
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.390
Into a bow.

905b32b5-f993-46cf-b527-3e113a033a4b-0
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.846
And it looks as though it's
being put into a suitcase. Oh

905b32b5-f993-46cf-b527-3e113a033a4b-1
00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:16.400
yeah, it's being put into a
suitcase. So.

e3e91405-8cfa-47b5-843a-8f53d4e6f9b9-0
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.515
Someone is moving and they're
taking a precious photo with

e3e91405-8cfa-47b5-843a-8f53d4e6f9b9-1
00:19:22.515 --> 00:19:22.890
them.

e0837fad-4015-454a-873e-8eec07a66359-0
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.820
Carefully.

080c0b1a-50fa-43df-9fcb-a19d99158d61-0
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.131
Tying things up. I don't
understand the lower left photo

080c0b1a-50fa-43df-9fcb-a19d99158d61-1
00:19:30.131 --> 00:19:32.981
where it looks like they're
pulling some kind of a string

080c0b1a-50fa-43df-9fcb-a19d99158d61-2
00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:35.487
through. Oh no, they're
tightening the belt on the

080c0b1a-50fa-43df-9fcb-a19d99158d61-3
00:19:35.487 --> 00:19:35.930
suitcase.

bcf6e5a2-58d1-423b-8f97-8218293121ba-0
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.770
And then?

bcf14407-12bb-4b87-a1c3-36a0403eb3be-0
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.020
Maybe meditating a little bit.

62a24d58-be34-43dc-86bd-03adcccf4af6-0
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.616
On the fact that something very
precious is in the suitcase and

62a24d58-be34-43dc-86bd-03adcccf4af6-1
00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:47.400
that a move is underway.

2e8667a7-0863-484e-9330-ed161d932c31-0
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.370
That's what I'm seeing from
those, Megan.

dedce5cc-f00b-403d-ab41-6b308b4bfc73-0
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:52.970
Oh my goodness. OK.

bf385e51-6739-4d46-9363-a0404770843a-0
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.210
Yep, there we go. So.

7ca94b80-78cf-473f-bdf5-92006cb614f0-0
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.300
In the large picture I can see.

d84eaa03-2adb-4277-98d1-0ced74a5386a-0
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.040
Mother and father.

4891455e-2afe-4dc5-bf7b-00a7dc03d793-0
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.340
Holding hands there.

b3493759-3a31-4f4b-bea7-98a181097edc-0
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.160
And moved by what they're doing,
and they're pausing.

1f2f793f-e7c8-4032-8d3f-9761e3b80e39-0
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.370
I'm curious.

d562953e-c333-49aa-b943-ac5c98ae15de-0
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.002
They're about to have tea, I
think, because the teapot has

d562953e-c333-49aa-b943-ac5c98ae15de-1
00:20:23.002 --> 00:20:24.540
steam coming out of it.

45e2b148-aa94-4fad-8c69-8c1ee5ec772c-0
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.314
And there's a beautiful little
child's drawing of the

45e2b148-aa94-4fad-8c69-8c1ee5ec772c-1
00:20:29.314 --> 00:20:32.000
photograph. Now I can see that
it is a photograph.

0f8e4475-e18c-414d-896f-bfd1b35b4f2f-0
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.075
It looks as though maybe the
child has passed away. Oh my

0f8e4475-e18c-414d-896f-bfd1b35b4f2f-1
00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:37.910
gosh, how sad.

d2e069a7-0d8c-4a0f-b36b-d7759c88610a-0
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.569
And there's a they're showing
more views of the house where

d2e069a7-0d8c-4a0f-b36b-d7759c88610a-1
00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:48.116
they all live. Yes, that child's
drawing of that photo is over

d2e069a7-0d8c-4a0f-b36b-d7759c88610a-2
00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:48.910
the mantle.

86332b12-00ba-478d-bd6b-180a27eb039b-0
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.580
Of the house.

a2d1dc15-4288-40d0-8753-393552c8bc2f-0
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.090
Yeah, there's a sadness.

5037f216-0458-4035-8dcb-f621870e90d1-0
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.538
And it looks as though they're
they have tickets to go on a

5037f216-0458-4035-8dcb-f621870e90d1-1
00:20:58.538 --> 00:21:01.420
steamer I bet they're coming to
the USA from.

b443e29b-6eb9-4ded-b5b7-c3c72696c359-0
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.000
From Europe back in the turn of
the century.

e45ede60-3837-44ad-8343-07ce2fdf2892-0
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:06.780
Yeah.

780d902f-94ad-4b4b-8123-54cc7e525582-0
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.560
OK, that's all I've got for
that.

ed2fd012-ae73-4d95-8c81-bbf8a504df83-0
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:17.269
Oh, Oh my goodness. All right,
so that's exactly what they're

ed2fd012-ae73-4d95-8c81-bbf8a504df83-1
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:22.141
doing. And luckily the child is
alive and well and she's waking

ed2fd012-ae73-4d95-8c81-bbf8a504df83-2
00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:22.370
up.

06cd0cf5-7b0a-4b6c-a7e0-a340b8cfaaca-0
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.064
Having some cereal, having some
breakfast and they're all

06cd0cf5-7b0a-4b6c-a7e0-a340b8cfaaca-1
00:21:27.064 --> 00:21:30.940
getting dressed in their coats
and warm garments, boots.

74ab0def-af4c-4e05-8502-968cbc9bf8f0-0
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.500
And leaving their home.

bfe6e12c-fe28-45c2-a925-17905f5e5d99-0
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.777
There's kind of a remarkable
Dragon's tail shadow on the

bfe6e12c-fe28-45c2-a925-17905f5e5d99-1
00:21:37.777 --> 00:21:39.180
House as they leave it.

b8a519c4-bb91-482c-85c7-cd8b8f6b4039-0
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.078
I don't quite know why, and
they're heading out to the

b8a519c4-bb91-482c-85c7-cd8b8f6b4039-1
00:21:43.078 --> 00:21:44.580
unknown as far as I can tell.

be07dad7-d35c-4af1-9d6b-19723d75b92f-0
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.410
OK.

9a9ae1c5-1e6c-4444-bb0b-f35c6f2a3607-0
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:53.950
Yeah, my goodness. So here.

717366ba-d496-49d0-b551-6354c4086caf-0
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.020
There's a beautiful little bit

c7281990-8527-4638-aa1b-a186b1b1230f-0
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.861
There's a little bit of a bird
sculpture that was probably made

c7281990-8527-4638-aa1b-a186b1b1230f-1
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:02.630
by the girl out of paper it
looks like and.

2a4730e4-8e9d-421a-ab2c-0a738284830b-0
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.980
She's holding it then saying
goodbye to the dad.

de8be4c1-d616-495e-bd55-6d86e9e0bec8-0
00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.377
Maybe he's putting the bird
under his hat. Yep, Yep, there's

de8be4c1-d616-495e-bd55-6d86e9e0bec8-1
00:22:12.377 --> 00:22:13.070
the train.

133ed1e1-794f-4bac-a84a-ad3a6793ed8c-0
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.090
The mother is crying.

b1deda49-2f1f-4040-9d39-390a5d849ca7-0
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.259
Yeah, both the mother... the
dad's getting on the train with

b1deda49-2f1f-4040-9d39-390a5d849ca7-1
00:22:21.259 --> 00:22:25.243
that suitcase that they packed
with the photo of the three of

b1deda49-2f1f-4040-9d39-390a5d849ca7-2
00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:25.949
them in it.

874fc6f7-ffe2-4f51-a904-4c631e873e32-0
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.055
They're all saying goodbye and
the train's going off. Oh my

874fc6f7-ffe2-4f51-a904-4c631e873e32-1
00:22:30.055 --> 00:22:30.550
goodness.

d8d887be-740b-45b2-8b99-c4ae4287aef0-0
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.810
Yep, off into the distance.

db576801-72fb-4b60-84ee-c5002de3fc79-0
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.700
OK.

669b0a31-b22d-4aac-a0e3-98ee7ce0973b-0
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.540
And now we're seeing that photo
again. So he's arrived at his

669b0a31-b22d-4aac-a0e3-98ee7ce0973b-1
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.200
destination and he unpacks.

a6fde13b-6a3c-4c96-8533-385658d026a1-0
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.300
Has a bowl of soup.

9b17b7fa-075c-4f37-bd75-5a28ea910f9d-0
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.776
Fondly looking at the photo of
all of them. Oh, he's on it.

9b17b7fa-075c-4f37-bd75-5a28ea910f9d-1
00:22:48.776 --> 00:22:51.570
Yeah, that's it. He's in a
steamer.

4b2139d5-273c-48c2-944b-c70480861d83-0
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.180
Probably crossing the Atlantic.

9aeb2050-59b9-4e3f-a6dc-b538f5c1ad73-0
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.100
Adding to the new world.
Interesting. OK. #END_arrival_1

8c4559f9-9f89-419e-9e31-40fd0f2d07d6-0
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.200
OK, perfect.

df653e2f-9c35-408a-b357-50a6cee60085-0
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.190
That one.

2f37a519-0924-4ff2-90a2-6fc310ba7995-0
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.510
Let's see what we have next.

6bf3f4e4-e84d-4884-a62a-bf2157ffec48-0
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.450
OK, next we have another.

023a68d3-ed73-4426-989c-24d06ce7cd31-0
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.710
Um, complex scene.

1d73424c-7bb4-472f-91ea-453dbcedd486-0
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.210
Pull it up.

58b205a4-dc5b-4785-a881-1a237caacac4-0
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.060
Yeah, very evocative scenes.

f9488676-cc22-4fb7-aa3b-89f44342fcf0-0
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.400
Ohh let me share my screen.

a17583bb-b6a1-410c-961a-b228232944be-0
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.670
Ohh wait.

f8d22f75-b045-4ca6-b055-731738bd07db-0
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.130
Yeah, OK. I'm gonna share.

ef50c4e1-cfef-4501-8ded-b08c6153ffeb-0
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.876
And this, like before, this is a
complex scene, so three to five

ef50c4e1-cfef-4501-8ded-b08c6153ffeb-1
00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:04.250
minutes to describe what you
see.

a4f0d2cf-e1d8-4dab-8437-de4fdbe68853-0
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.420
OK, great.

4fa89b04-ddea-4d2b-a56f-83dde68172e4-0
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.001
#START_by_the_lake Yeah, it's
amazing how many people are here

4fa89b04-ddea-4d2b-a56f-83dde68172e4-1
00:24:12.001 --> 00:24:12.230
and.

c8c64477-1954-4aa5-ae48-1af3f48be189-0
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.761
Here in a setting it's a lake,
and it looks like it's in

c8c64477-1954-4aa5-ae48-1af3f48be189-1
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:20.885
northern Europe because there
are castles on the shores of the

c8c64477-1954-4aa5-ae48-1af3f48be189-2
00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:22.980
lake. Beautiful rocky coastline.

655d900d-0df2-48e8-8bcd-8098067a15e6-0
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.370
Big Manor houses.

00d4c98d-0b43-4d43-ba90-0c56dcb7ee96-0
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.910
uh, which are probably modern
summer houses, the stairs down

00d4c98d-0b43-4d43-ba90-0c56dcb7ee96-1
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.520
to the water. And there are
people boating and swimming and.

41a01d2e-0689-400e-a53d-cde433ec2796-0
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.055
Just having a great time. Flying
kites. There are beach

41a01d2e-0689-400e-a53d-cde433ec2796-1
00:24:42.055 --> 00:24:46.686
umbrellas, so making sand
castles. The dogs are in the

41a01d2e-0689-400e-a53d-cde433ec2796-2
00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:48.370
midst of everything.

c516da80-1c97-4435-82d9-b6d3f5e7f12f-0
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.202
There are some people are
wearing life preservers out in

c516da80-1c97-4435-82d9-b6d3f5e7f12f-1

There's a kayak, which I'd like
to be in. Been kayaking enough

time playing beach volleyball. I

little bit more what you see.

00:26:20.357 --> 00:26:24.701

have to expect that. Maybe it

tall. And so it's it's like an

foreign cars, they're smaller.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.522
There's definitely a Volkswagen
bug and maybe a Peugeot, that

00:28:31.522 --> 00:28:32.230
kind of thing.

celebration going on because

00:28:36.668 --> 00:28:40.362
there are striped colored
awnings here in the front. Oh,

one of the nicest aspects of

There are there weekend
markets.} Sometimes every day I

00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:57.438
can see a fire engine, nice and
handy if it were ever needed in

293e23e7-92fa-4f23-8b8c-c8cb9ece7b6b-2
00:28:57.438 --> 00:28:58.640
the police station.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.773
Look, there's been some kind of
an altercation in the top there.

7ac88a33-2287-4958-a469-105945cbd80a-1
00:29:03.773 --> 00:29:07.633
A bicyclist, maybe or two, have
fallen off their bikes, and it

00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:09.840
looks as though people are
running.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:15.743

and little kids leaving their

00:29:15.743 --> 00:29:20.633
school building being guided
across the street. I can see a

42c3aeff-ff0f-49a9-8417-839468f68e50-2
00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:20.960

There is a very messy garage
situation.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.400

about. Carport and.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.740
It's a very busy place. People
know just what they're doing.

f1cee43b-efd6-41ca-b587-02de6aece1fb-0
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.319
It looks like there's some
mischief going on, not a lot.

f1cee43b-efd6-41ca-b587-02de6aece1fb-1
00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:44.470
The I haven't got great clarity
here on the photos, I mean of on

f1cee43b-efd6-41ca-b587-02de6aece1fb-2
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.174
the drawing on my screen,
because there's something going

f1cee43b-efd6-41ca-b587-02de6aece1fb-3
00:29:48.174 --> 00:29:52.069
on near the center here on the
rooftop, people coming out of

f1cee43b-efd6-41ca-b587-02de6aece1fb-4
00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:56.092
the dormers and running around
the roof. So I don't know if if

f1cee43b-efd6-41ca-b587-02de6aece1fb-5
00:29:56.092 --> 00:29:59.030
they're burglars or what they
might be up to.

a6897875-4a48-4fd4-b2c5-324d046ec61b-0
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.503
But it's pretty charming. I'd
love to drop in for a couple of

a6897875-4a48-4fd4-b2c5-324d046ec61b-1
00:30:04.503 --> 00:30:04.870
hours.

80db6983-82f0-4f6e-8a6f-f6f0a829fcd3-0
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.692
{Is there anything else you
should I go tell, look, try to

80db6983-82f0-4f6e-8a6f-f6f0a829fcd3-1
00:30:13.692 --> 00:30:17.880
tell you more. Just a little bit
more. Yeah, little bit more.}

80db6983-82f0-4f6e-8a6f-f6f0a829fcd3-2
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.201
OK. So on another rooftop I can
see some workmen setting up a TV

80db6983-82f0-4f6e-8a6f-f6f0a829fcd3-3
00:30:22.201 --> 00:30:26.390
antenna or an antenna of some
kind. So I'm guessing it's a TV.

0f223ce1-874e-4cd6-a861-fd3f41eac7b8-0
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.590
And.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:40.049
Then there's a really strange
little top of the building at

42bbe229-c501-4aeb-be70-c5836bc9be2d-1
00:30:40.049 --> 00:30:45.398
the just left of center. It
looks like two men in some kind

42bbe229-c501-4aeb-be70-c5836bc9be2d-2
00:30:45.398 --> 00:30:47.360
of costume are having.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.688
A jousting match. I know what
that's all about. They're

ee69e744-50fa-4121-9435-24b6b28fb424-1
00:30:52.688 --> 00:30:53.830
wearing overalls.

d62d580f-f3eb-4680-a500-5280a2e4e1c9-0
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.820
There are several of. There are
maybe four of those.

fb6cded5-cfd5-415e-882e-c6e197049b54-0
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.879
People up there? Oh, oh, there's
a ladder heading up. I don't

fb6cded5-cfd5-415e-882e-c6e197049b54-1
00:31:01.879 --> 00:31:03.180
know what they're up to.

64cf8d6e-15fb-4ac2-93a3-23d6650a41c0-0
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.810
Sorry to say.

2d5ebc0f-004e-40f5-ad59-f1803b5934b8-0
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.786
But it doesn't seem to be
bothering anyone in any other

2d5ebc0f-004e-40f5-ad59-f1803b5934b8-1
00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:13.101
area of that building. They're
going about their business. Oh,

2d5ebc0f-004e-40f5-ad59-f1803b5934b8-2
00:31:13.101 --> 00:31:16.521
there's a man standing on a bus
like I can't imagine why over in

2d5ebc0f-004e-40f5-ad59-f1803b5934b8-3
00:31:16.521 --> 00:31:17.890
the far left. #END_waldo_1

a51f9dbc-0f7b-4814-91fe-e7874e79c8a6-0
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:25.105
I still haven't seen Waldo. I
know. I'm like looking also. You

a51f9dbc-0f7b-4814-91fe-e7874e79c8a6-1
00:31:25.105 --> 00:31:28.070
too. Yeah. Also can't find him.

e9e401f6-d17d-40c9-bc67-e7ff0f6bf48f-0
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.960
Interesting.

4d7aa235-cc25-4a27-8325-5501762a05ae-0
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.260
Uh, let's see what we have next.
So.

bab7498b-56ea-4d4c-97d7-7489b6c27952-0
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.470
OK, we have another short story.

e9316412-baa3-4a29-9341-3531417bc9f4-0
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.000
OK, so this one is 3 slides.

fba1fa35-c7a5-4de4-8b4b-1594d7cc92d7-0
00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.380
Same thing as before when you
finish one slide.

f72106de-11ee-4cdf-a8d7-40bb2cc07169-0
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.700
You tell me to move on, OK?

e3f1c0d2-fc7c-4801-b081-66450ab70c6c-0
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:09.770
#START_arrival_2 OK, great. So
OK, this looks like it's a scene

e3f1c0d2-fc7c-4801-b081-66450ab70c6c-1
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:14.727
from inside the the sailing ship
now that's carrying the father,

e3f1c0d2-fc7c-4801-b081-66450ab70c6c-2
00:32:14.727 --> 00:32:18.921
husband and father of this
family. And there are women

e3f1c0d2-fc7c-4801-b081-66450ab70c6c-3
00:32:18.921 --> 00:32:23.268
sitting with their heads
covered, men sitting in another

e3f1c0d2-fc7c-4801-b081-66450ab70c6c-4
00:32:23.268 --> 00:32:26.089
area. There's one woman with a
baby.

eadf9095-c61e-4cc2-abf2-446e4e9aeff1-0
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.930
And the father

b1ec63bf-3c74-42fa-96eb-1356bd9389eb-0
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.360
Seems to be writing in a
journal.

c157892b-6802-4de6-9ed8-0bddc2b1221f-0
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.055
It's interesting that he's been
able to bring that along with

c157892b-6802-4de6-9ed8-0bddc2b1221f-1
00:32:35.055 --> 00:32:35.230
him.

fe384252-bc38-4dc9-83d4-b7759a68dd84-0
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.020
And.

7f43cad4-ab80-496a-a86b-6aa6641e59c7-0
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.700
And he's tearing out a page from
the journal.

339fe123-be8b-431c-8c5f-c17875227d26-0
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.930
And making a bird just like the
one his daughter gave him.

ce2329c6-f90d-4709-97fb-9cd28c2c5425-0
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.210
Very nice. And he holds it up.

bf3a45e3-6d7c-4112-86ff-2cef76917857-0
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.362
How interesting. Maybe this is
something a lot of people have

bf3a45e3-6d7c-4112-86ff-2cef76917857-1
00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:53.630
done.

8881b567-6b76-467e-afd6-9b5d5a063ce7-0
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.500
and

8a72b58c-56de-47d0-a47d-02d1b80a0b97-0
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.450
he is

65e0ebcb-aa70-49b1-8449-3883bf4ebd6f-0
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.167
Looking behind him, I can't
imagine why he's getting up. And

65e0ebcb-aa70-49b1-8449-3883bf4ebd6f-1
00:33:03.167 --> 00:33:04.440
on the next page.

598f5716-6dd1-4d7f-8eeb-df5642cd03c2-0
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.980
He's looking up into the sky and
it.

f2bcb9be-439f-4d79-a195-a1d43f819f18-0
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.810
It's showing.

62c609fa-f2e1-436f-b18f-23d3acc6bb23-0
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.888
Just a whole flock of birds
looking a lot like those paper

62c609fa-f2e1-436f-b18f-23d3acc6bb23-1
00:33:13.888 --> 00:33:18.190
birds that they've been folding
flying over the arriving ship.

b5a3354e-af76-40a8-8122-4c4dc11de927-0
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:23.525
Well, maybe the ship is still
underway and and the passengers

b5a3354e-af76-40a8-8122-4c4dc11de927-1
00:33:23.525 --> 00:33:27.388
are out all remarking and
watching these this flock of

b5a3354e-af76-40a8-8122-4c4dc11de927-2
00:33:27.388 --> 00:33:27.810
birds.

e8e3fbc7-3726-4bfe-aa63-17a4502ce17f-0
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.310
Very interesting.

e7646eec-cc03-454f-b2a3-3b75cb362d87-0
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.903
On the deck of the ship. Yep.
OK, I can see the next page,

e7646eec-cc03-454f-b2a3-3b75cb362d87-1
00:33:34.903 --> 00:33:39.900
please. K. Oh And here comes
that ship into New York Harbor.

c884b0c0-a62c-4633-ba13-5b24761518fa-0
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.400
It looks like from a distance,
however.

0f47a995-4e83-4d90-9d72-22ce6fb69855-0
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.880
As you see a close up of these
statues.

48fcb389-6cd5-4d32-ad9e-cf64f12317b2-0
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.696
They're very unusual, looks more
like it's gone somewhere in

48fcb389-6cd5-4d32-ad9e-cf64f12317b2-1
00:33:53.696 --> 00:33:54.050
Asia.

1be50619-8b35-4c99-a9a3-9c26f0009355-0
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:59.037
It's got some mythic statues
shaking hands or holding hands

1be50619-8b35-4c99-a9a3-9c26f0009355-1
00:33:59.037 --> 00:33:59.510
across.

74aee6f8-9f6b-4b95-8901-69a6c0ba5702-0
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.270
Across the water, maybe making a
bit of a bridge thing there.

24f9a12c-b9de-40a4-8ad1-2ff31359319e-0
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:10.671
With some mythic animals perched
on their arm and on a on the

24f9a12c-b9de-40a4-8ad1-2ff31359319e-1
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:11.130
back.

98d7ecac-2e40-408d-b07e-56855c62a92e-0
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.490
No.

861a5e4d-cab2-4ab7-9a16-d6a06e3b12cb-0
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.410
Very interesting.

5c06ab7d-429a-4985-b92a-4e7d179f909c-0
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.139
Arrival, definitely arrival. The
father is on the ship and it's

5c06ab7d-429a-4985-b92a-4e7d179f909c-1
00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.120
arriving at a harbor.

0be1b1e4-34ba-44c3-ad27-923fa5d411d3-0
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:28.653
OK, I guess the next one now
please. Mammoth ship, absolutely

0be1b1e4-34ba-44c3-ad27-923fa5d411d3-1
00:34:28.653 --> 00:34:30.200
mammoth. OK. And

4cb7f47d-09e1-498d-bc59-00c920e78221-0
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.713
See that on the left. And then
the father is in a crowd and

4cb7f47d-09e1-498d-bc59-00c920e78221-1
00:34:35.713 --> 00:34:40.471
they're being told where to go
and some gates are opening for

4cb7f47d-09e1-498d-bc59-00c920e78221-2
00:34:40.471 --> 00:34:43.080
them. He's carrying his
suitcase.

0c67c7da-f77a-4fb7-bfa6-2b90a1fe3436-0
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.511
Amongst the throng of people and
they're waiting in a line,

0c67c7da-f77a-4fb7-bfa6-2b90a1fe3436-1
00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:50.857
they've exited the boat and
they're waiting on the on the

0c67c7da-f77a-4fb7-bfa6-2b90a1fe3436-2
00:34:50.857 --> 00:34:52.530
pier, I'd say. #END_arrival_2

88580c79-d54b-482d-b163-ef28cd984e76-0
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:55.170
OK, go to the next one.

8516d215-57da-424f-b2ca-0e09136d2ec3-0
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.615
That's the end of that one. OK,
so we are halfway through our

8516d215-57da-424f-b2ca-0e09136d2ec3-1
00:35:01.615 --> 00:35:05.634
session today if you wanted to
take a 2 to 3 minute break if

8516d215-57da-424f-b2ca-0e09136d2ec3-2
00:35:05.634 --> 00:35:08.600
you needed to grab water or
anything if not.

c8044506-19d5-490e-aebe-b90e4ea5510d-0
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.350
Like.

8e4fac3d-6cc0-43f8-a9f6-ab31d18ea2f4-0
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.810
Yeah.

94760d2c-a596-42d5-8279-91b63508fabb-0
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.800
Let me just get a little Oh no,
I'm fine. I'm fine. I've got my

94760d2c-a596-42d5-8279-91b63508fabb-1
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.180
teeth.

4b7cf18b-768d-42c8-b121-1ea5f54bebd7-0
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.255
You wanna break? So Megan. Ohh
no I'm good. So I'm going to

4b7cf18b-768d-42c8-b121-1ea5f54bebd7-1
00:35:22.255 --> 00:35:24.540
pull up the next one. Our next
one is.

6517f0c1-3af9-4049-9c9c-b127448c0ee9-0
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.350
Also a short story.

1aa80a0d-6cbf-49c0-b93e-e25bb07147ce-0
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.470
Let me pull it up.

aedd1e35-726d-46bf-9883-f5c1b4109d01-0
00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.170
OK, so this one is.

1087e3ba-bd9f-45fe-a00d-e3102db6d0e5-0
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.160
Approximately 20 slides. Um,
same thing as before, whenever.

e31201a2-7eb7-4be7-b27e-f355e68424ae-0
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.340
Um, you want me to? I will.

115a7aa3-cb01-44ff-8e54-4b2aa0766800-0
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.980
Progress with the story.

37b5514a-eac3-46b3-bb29-bc6d7f30af96-0
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.680
OK.

d27c1d34-9322-4b33-9679-1c821036ae5d-0
00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.773
#START_journey So the story is
beginning here and says for

d27c1d34-9322-4b33-9679-1c821036ae5d-1
00:35:59.773 --> 00:36:00.450
Josephine.

da155e0e-fe9f-44a6-9ec3-7fb58b602620-0
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.886
And it looks as though we've got
the same characters, the boy and

da155e0e-fe9f-44a6-9ec3-7fb58b602620-1
00:36:04.886 --> 00:36:06.690
the girl that were in the last
one.

1fc3fe50-5e46-476b-91b2-e95dbedc1dd5-0
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.080
And they're in. They're in the
city again.

3770a92b-c63c-4c17-9619-e94dcaa75e7b-0
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.729
And the boy's got one of those
wands in his hand, and the girls

3770a92b-c63c-4c17-9619-e94dcaa75e7b-1
00:36:15.729 --> 00:36:19.997
sitting looking dejected or sad
on her step. And there's a

3770a92b-c63c-4c17-9619-e94dcaa75e7b-2
00:36:19.997 --> 00:36:24.265
scooter. A red scooter. Color
seems to be symbolic in this

3770a92b-c63c-4c17-9619-e94dcaa75e7b-3
00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:28.461
series of stories. She's sitting
on the front stoop of an

3770a92b-c63c-4c17-9619-e94dcaa75e7b-4
00:36:28.461 --> 00:36:32.728
apartment building, and I can
see her mom and her dad, I'm

3770a92b-c63c-4c17-9619-e94dcaa75e7b-5
00:36:32.728 --> 00:36:33.380
guessing.

57627328-cacd-4d34-8589-0b70d8207919-0
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:38.863
And maybe a sister, unless it's
actually her her inside the

57627328-cacd-4d34-8589-0b70d8207919-1
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:43.526
house. We can even see the
basement and the and the sewers

57627328-cacd-4d34-8589-0b70d8207919-2
00:36:43.526 --> 00:36:48.428
under the street. So it's a real
cross section of the city at

57627328-cacd-4d34-8589-0b70d8207919-3
00:36:48.428 --> 00:36:49.930
this point. Thanks.

4e2a878b-63f5-4525-89fe-ca09d4b99bdf-0
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.350
So now we see she's brought the
scooter inside and they're in.

0a9b2429-6a27-4a98-b3fd-f83405eb1d7c-0
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.060
Their kitchen. Her mom's.

40952551-540b-45d0-828e-bb00420df69f-0
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.640
Speaking on very old-fashioned
phone while cooking.

884e92a4-c4a0-49a7-8e10-cb94cce5e8a4-0
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.100
And it looks as though the
girl's busy at the counter.

a38c5e32-c57f-4bab-8ace-262c3d49d082-0
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.980
Her red scooter's.

2e2aea9f-9c72-4398-928b-119db9192335-0
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.949
Leaning against the counter, she
apparently leaves it there and

2e2aea9f-9c72-4398-928b-119db9192335-1
00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:24.615
now has a red kite, and these
things are probably significant.

2e2aea9f-9c72-4398-928b-119db9192335-2
00:37:24.615 --> 00:37:29.133
And she's looking over her dad's
shoulder as he works at the

2e2aea9f-9c72-4398-928b-119db9192335-3
00:37:29.133 --> 00:37:29.800
computer.

5134e26e-81ad-4173-a60d-efbf2fe26834-0
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.378
Both her mom and her dad are
busy and they're not paying her

5134e26e-81ad-4173-a60d-efbf2fe26834-1
00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:38.326
any attention, OK. And now she's
trying to get her older sister's

5134e26e-81ad-4173-a60d-efbf2fe26834-2
00:37:38.326 --> 00:37:42.034
attention, sister's sprawled on
the couch and she's busy with

5134e26e-81ad-4173-a60d-efbf2fe26834-3
00:37:42.034 --> 00:37:45.623
something or rather, I can't
quite tell what. And the girls

5134e26e-81ad-4173-a60d-efbf2fe26834-4
00:37:45.623 --> 00:37:49.092
got something else red, which
might be a balloon? I can't

5134e26e-81ad-4173-a60d-efbf2fe26834-5
00:37:49.092 --> 00:37:49.750
quite tell.

a9bc6405-5fa8-4959-9da6-9d4acbd4d4da-0
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.842
She realizes everyone else is
busy. She goes up to her room

a9bc6405-5fa8-4959-9da6-9d4acbd4d4da-1
00:37:54.842 --> 00:37:57.230
and it looks as though she's
taking a nap.

68252919-4da7-475b-a36f-183a9569094d-0
00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.317
On her bed, with the cat curled
up on the floor near her, I can

68252919-4da7-475b-a36f-183a9569094d-1
00:38:02.317 --> 00:38:04.410
see the city out the outer
window.

6478f44b-3bb5-4d08-a05b-f80c8574a575-0
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.210
And a map of the world.

caf74f72-b9a8-42fd-a488-64f97d54c4b2-0
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.210
So.

fcc51a18-9ac9-44c4-a550-500210b1c5d2-0
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.910
Cat wakes up. So does she.

c0fdda58-c7f5-4e70-9b4c-31384a3b5c15-0
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:18.030
And her red wand is on the floor
with some papers, and she gets

c0fdda58-c7f5-4e70-9b4c-31384a3b5c15-1
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:23.102
up and uses that red wand to
draw. If these are magic wands,

c0fdda58-c7f5-4e70-9b4c-31384a3b5c15-2
00:38:23.102 --> 00:38:24.100
aren't they?

2c58751d-2f74-4e03-bdb3-cb7e2a4b6704-0
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.722
She's drawing a portal on her
door, on her wall, and it

2c58751d-2f74-4e03-bdb3-cb7e2a4b6704-1
00:38:28.722 --> 00:38:31.410
becomes a doorway and she dashes
through.

9bcb7c30-c670-441d-9f5d-5fe1069292f8-0
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:39.273
And the red door opens onto a
beautiful forested park with

9bcb7c30-c670-441d-9f5d-5fe1069292f8-1
00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:42.100
lanterns hanging ornate
lanterns.

ed466de2-357c-4e67-9d0f-94dcf4aa74bc-0
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.830
And lights all through.

c47f0949-3526-47dc-ac9f-4c6184916176-0
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.650
I don't see anyone else but her
at the moment.

1085f19c-e510-491f-937a-603ba8c23326-0
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.802
There's something in the
distance I can't make it out.

1085f19c-e510-491f-937a-603ba8c23326-1
00:38:52.802 --> 00:38:54.980
Looks like a table or or bench
or something.

2de75127-a46d-4252-b928-9da134900661-0
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.600
OK, there it is. Oh.

df061c87-3aca-4567-93e1-f16d6b992e6e-0
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.810
It's a pier a little pier that
extends out into.

0be8d9b5-a8cf-4ee1-a1e3-4dc1e4b73467-0
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.670
Brook or river? Small river
tributary.

9febcc6f-f6ba-4420-a94b-f08773f328dd-0
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.840
She.

9a2b5790-a098-4e28-9def-bae6116b12da-0
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:15.833
Bins over the end of the pier
and draws herself a little, a

9a2b5790-a098-4e28-9def-bae6116b12da-1
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:20.135
little boat and takes off in the
boat. Everything, everything

9a2b5790-a098-4e28-9def-bae6116b12da-2
00:39:20.135 --> 00:39:21.940
that liberates her is red.

62086460-4c9e-47fb-8cdc-ab85af284236-0
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.360
K we can go on from there.

a5790222-067d-45d0-aecd-9dffa9255d34-0
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.529
Oh my gosh. And now she's
approaching a castle. And it

a5790222-067d-45d0-aecd-9dffa9255d34-1
00:39:31.529 --> 00:39:35.846
looks like the castle that she
and the young boy were visiting

a5790222-067d-45d0-aecd-9dffa9255d34-2
00:39:35.846 --> 00:39:38.930
before. I remember those those
gold turrets.

4cc62a70-577a-4856-a07e-488bbe119130-0
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.530
Round turrets on some of the
upper parts of the building.

a6b933b1-0d18-4ff8-bba4-7a766178e26b-0
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:48.549
And there's a windmill in the
distance, a body of water coming

a6b933b1-0d18-4ff8-bba4-7a766178e26b-1
00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:52.642
in, forming the moat around the
castle, and she is heading in

a6b933b1-0d18-4ff8-bba4-7a766178e26b-2
00:39:52.642 --> 00:39:56.010
her little boat directly into
the castle entrance.

97d0c339-850c-4878-a557-e009c736e9ad-0
00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.517
I don't see any other people. Oh
yes, I do a couple of them in a

97d0c339-850c-4878-a557-e009c736e9ad-1
00:40:01.517 --> 00:40:01.840
boat.

d55586e2-8053-4270-abc4-46df45b17220-0
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.380
In a boat.

84f89927-c624-4ed1-baf6-fa1ebe7f93fc-0
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.470
OK, we can go to the next one.

a4793430-c7e9-48cd-954f-c7e5a619cf50-0
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:14.090
So remarkable series of canals
here, on all different levels.

56b5006d-173f-4ef1-9c5b-b8884fe90bca-0
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.068
And this little girl is being
greeted by everyone. So this is

56b5006d-173f-4ef1-9c5b-b8884fe90bca-1
00:40:19.068 --> 00:40:20.250
the friendly city.

c4ab0a1d-1860-4379-a841-5f7e46d83615-0
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.893
And then she has the soldiers in
there, in uniforms waving to her

c4ab0a1d-1860-4379-a841-5f7e46d83615-1
00:40:25.893 --> 00:40:28.490
and guiding her onward, it looks
like.

d4ed73f7-a922-4206-88a4-d6ee2c4f7591-0
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.450
There's a series of locks.

21e3ce52-5474-4ef6-bb3e-1a498d551e52-0
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.900
In a very primitive castle, it's
pretty interesting.

1661f3b1-5e87-492a-b2c9-9fc3a0e9ebfb-0
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.920
Other people in boats.

dd178218-5bc8-4d6d-82ff-eaba42e62bc8-0
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:43.230
That are standing up and using
the Poles to navigate. I see a

dd178218-5bc8-4d6d-82ff-eaba42e62bc8-1
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:48.189
fish on top of a turret. There's
not a lot else going on besides

dd178218-5bc8-4d6d-82ff-eaba42e62bc8-2
00:40:48.189 --> 00:40:50.250
people in boats and in the.

4a9c2eb6-2fc4-4870-8c52-984efa5f3f70-0
00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.803
And the and the soldiers or the
police or something helping her

4a9c2eb6-2fc4-4870-8c52-984efa5f3f70-1
00:40:54.803 --> 00:40:55.580
find her way.

b0a242cd-f938-408b-925d-f6264ce58cfc-0
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:59.190
And a waterfall. OK, we can go
on.

bb17bf66-c7d8-4be5-8f9d-55a5747de2cb-0
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.020
And she.

d0db8ce9-0837-4aa1-bed1-b31573eefa2d-0
00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.980
Approaches the waterfall in her
boat.

52824f5b-022f-43f8-b049-b4da04a4364d-0
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.410
Draws herself, drawing herself
1/2 circle in the sky.

846c0f8d-a71a-4288-98bf-b10e84306bdf-0
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.413
She's heading around from one
side to the other and the boat

846c0f8d-a71a-4288-98bf-b10e84306bdf-1
00:41:18.413 --> 00:41:19.780
just falls away from her.

e3e8ed81-a3c3-4fad-ba1b-60ccce416525-0
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.445
I don't know where she's going,
but we should look at the next

e3e8ed81-a3c3-4fad-ba1b-60ccce416525-1
00:41:23.445 --> 00:41:23.610
one.

07e7fbcf-c1a7-45f1-b710-32f2b1b90038-0
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.750
Yep, it becomes a balloon with a
little little.

2f8df71a-f163-4dc5-a27e-831160b9a94f-0
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:33.190
Carriage.

a2a491c1-b83f-4209-99b7-3793656ef307-0
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.520
Suspended from it.

37cbedef-89cf-4d50-968e-c12e53c3597c-0
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.474
And she's waving goodbye. It's a
really friendly city, so I don't

37cbedef-89cf-4d50-968e-c12e53c3597c-1
00:41:40.474 --> 00:41:44.684
know why she wants to leave it,
but she is. Off she goes. And we

37cbedef-89cf-4d50-968e-c12e53c3597c-2
00:41:44.684 --> 00:41:48.505
can see on the next page the
beautiful purple quetzal bird

37cbedef-89cf-4d50-968e-c12e53c3597c-3
00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:52.132
with the tail. I think that's
what birds with tails are

37cbedef-89cf-4d50-968e-c12e53c3597c-4
00:41:52.132 --> 00:41:56.212
called, like the ones in Central
America, the beautiful purple

37cbedef-89cf-4d50-968e-c12e53c3597c-5
00:41:56.212 --> 00:41:56.990
tailed bird.

4dca3094-6960-4e5e-9826-d69e964649c9-0
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.490
Is in the distance and some of
those.

008b8abe-2f01-4ae6-b53f-b14326885f9b-0
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.540
That's really interesting,
flying boats.

5a511f63-6dcf-4b4e-b5da-1b19918805c4-0
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.610
One with two chimneys.

2c7de7df-e0ba-4286-b79d-a74c4f9f3adb-0
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.900
I don't know where they're
going.

eba556ef-3195-4198-a0ee-3373f3b04e49-0
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.460
Go to the next one.

e3d7d77c-f297-4825-a8ae-ffdfaec489d9-0
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.060
And a close up of her in the
balloon.

8e380638-e037-4380-a129-72abc6302996-0
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.660
And.

6e4529d0-c6fa-428e-9ae5-ccb4d264b726-0
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.090
Looks as though.

b7dcb4c0-db93-4f67-897a-2182341e01fa-0
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.190
In one of the one of those.

bee9df3a-12e0-4fc4-8abf-03fbfe401120-0
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.545
Those dirigibles is what they
were called in the old days. Ohh

bee9df3a-12e0-4fc4-8abf-03fbfe401120-1
00:42:29.545 --> 00:42:31.750
gosh, it looks as though there's
someone in.

c48622ef-dcc6-43ed-b9de-b4e0448c88c2-0
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.140
King's outfit or whatever.

84a66a28-bea3-4899-9930-7ed9ae14dc10-0
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.390
That's.

70007656-4bc0-46dd-b362-ac919d3bc89c-0
00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.230
Pointing a gun, perhaps, but
even more threatening is.

e413f719-662e-40d3-9a6c-8622706d25b6-0
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:46.137
Someone with a net trying to
catch her bird, and she could

e413f719-662e-40d3-9a6c-8622706d25b6-1
00:42:46.137 --> 00:42:49.023
see that happening from a
distance. She has her red wand

e413f719-662e-40d3-9a6c-8622706d25b6-2
00:42:49.023 --> 00:42:51.960
in her hand, but she doesn't
know what to paint next yet.

c261d631-6334-4b69-9736-f4a0568a060a-0
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.084
And there's those crazy flying
machines. You know, the ornate

c261d631-6334-4b69-9736-f4a0568a060a-1
00:42:56.084 --> 00:42:57.420
ones in the distance, too.

999e1602-b6bf-4d59-be94-88eeeafa52e0-0
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.270
OK, we should go to the next
one.

eed64405-6890-4ab7-b934-aa8120ade6a6-0
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:06.930
So, all right, she is. Where did
the bird go?

3eb713da-beef-4b40-9df3-5ec4d832dc5f-0
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.589
Oh, the bird's been captured.
Darn. Alright, and he's in a

3eb713da-beef-4b40-9df3-5ec4d832dc5f-1
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.900
cage.

e42d7f6b-d9c8-4ff4-9a18-4849cef19156-0
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.770
And on one of the upper decks,
the platforms of this ornate

e42d7f6b-d9c8-4ff4-9a18-4849cef19156-1
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.987
flying machine, that's a steam
machine, from the looks of it,

e42d7f6b-d9c8-4ff4-9a18-4849cef19156-2
00:43:20.987 --> 00:43:25.135
it's actually got steam coming
out of it. Just two chimneys.

e42d7f6b-d9c8-4ff4-9a18-4849cef19156-3
00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:27.040
It's kind of a paddle wheel.

16367622-7aec-48bb-ac4d-c02c2bd90168-0
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.440
boat.

cf28393d-c9cd-4590-86eb-ccccc015a246-0
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:35.063
And there are smaller versions
of them around. She's following

cf28393d-c9cd-4590-86eb-ccccc015a246-1
00:43:35.063 --> 00:43:35.910
it in her.

b5f9894b-00c2-42a1-ab7c-9e4047527ed4-0
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.330
Big red balloon I can't believe
she's not being.

ecd2ead3-8bd5-43ed-a2ca-daa73342e528-0
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:43.330
Being captured or whatever, but
she's just observing for now.

d59405e3-d83d-4b0a-808c-6b17d000ca2f-0
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.266
And it's making its way. They're
quite high up in the sky because

d59405e3-d83d-4b0a-808c-6b17d000ca2f-1
00:43:47.266 --> 00:43:50.290
they're really above the first
layer of clouds, it looks like.

d7be9a53-9b10-4e6f-9f6f-502258123278-0
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:52.390
Sky is blue otherwise.

fa1daee2-18b0-4c3f-8ed6-2425e5ed3a69-0
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.340
And there's a gold firebird
attached to this Firebird

fa1daee2-18b0-4c3f-8ed6-2425e5ed3a69-1
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.857
platform attached to that ornate
flying machine. Don't know why

fa1daee2-18b0-4c3f-8ed6-2425e5ed3a69-2
00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:03.140
yet.

d4ce3391-ed10-4448-aaa1-7fbc88c6dab8-0
00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.590
OK. We can go to the next one,
Megan. Thanks.

f0301ea1-2b6f-46e1-be44-928d6a32b468-0
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:12.631
Oh, there we go. There's a close
up and she's oh OK. So that's

f0301ea1-2b6f-46e1-be44-928d6a32b468-1
00:44:12.631 --> 00:44:17.029
where the birds being kept on
that platform and looks as

f0301ea1-2b6f-46e1-be44-928d6a32b468-2
00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:17.570
though.

ebb5d854-0b37-4181-8f8f-3ac9ffd5f076-0
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.380
They prize these birds and.

8148db58-f2a3-4c93-adcf-ad936a4cfbfe-0
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.500
They've got him there.

b45598f4-5d3d-499f-8ded-6acb0e148d32-0
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.320
Being guarded by two soldiers.

7ea7057a-960b-4b90-a5c1-51ae63002cf6-0
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:33.664
While she comes up a ladder
behind them with her red wand,

7ea7057a-960b-4b90-a5c1-51ae63002cf6-1
00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:36.870
ready to Draw Something, I'm
sure.

748377aa-939a-4849-a444-b84cc694f47d-0
00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.710
We should go to the next one and
hopefully find out.

38dfd4a3-569b-4771-9b17-19b9c19bf04c-0
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:45.390
Wow. She steals the bird right
off the pedestal.

2e23952b-d24a-478b-a861-1d95acffefd3-0
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.280
And she's running with it.

0e5c038d-73db-4759-9be0-dad8454abf2d-0
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:52.160
OK, she gets to the end of the
boat.

81ef1dc3-37bb-46f8-8278-043d9a080607-0
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.620
Extended platform and lets the
bird go off into the sky.

08e94e5e-65e6-4119-8675-ac850423d895-0
00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.890
Meanwhile, her red wand is
sitting on.

9578b615-6db0-4acf-84ec-81c28f646065-0
00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.791
The floor of this area and and
there are soldiers running

9578b615-6db0-4acf-84ec-81c28f646065-1
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:10.250
towards her. I hope she can get
it and we'll see.

fc963583-5b37-4424-817e-9205be61630b-0
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.323
Nope. It goes flying off and
she's been grabbed. That's her

fc963583-5b37-4424-817e-9205be61630b-1
00:45:16.323 --> 00:45:18.100
magic portal that she.

b2abd1df-684f-4d4f-a5e1-2991ceaf5bd6-0
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.819
Creates, you know, exits and
entrances with those things. So

b2abd1df-684f-4d4f-a5e1-2991ceaf5bd6-1
00:45:22.819 --> 00:45:26.202
she's she's been captured and
they've got her in a cage and

b2abd1df-684f-4d4f-a5e1-2991ceaf5bd6-2
00:45:26.202 --> 00:45:29.810
they're suspending her below the
flying machine. She looks like

b2abd1df-684f-4d4f-a5e1-2991ceaf5bd6-3
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:30.600
she's trapped.

e6853cdc-b66c-4bc1-a05f-0f97f7d44b37-0
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.340
Ohh dear.

b33023ec-f69c-4e82-afec-16dd82402390-0
00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.130
All right, we should look at the
next one.

aaf24a40-bb5d-4bfc-83af-64a2a625007e-0
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.780
Oh, the bird.

c74f2e5a-0c0c-4b05-b643-ab7bab68638e-0
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:46.047
has captured he's caught her red
wand, and he's heading for her

c74f2e5a-0c0c-4b05-b643-ab7bab68638e-1
00:45:46.047 --> 00:45:49.857
in her her little suspended jail
there. Oh my gosh. That

c74f2e5a-0c0c-4b05-b643-ab7bab68638e-2
00:45:49.857 --> 00:45:53.868
beautiful bird is sitting on her
shoulder while she draws a

c74f2e5a-0c0c-4b05-b643-ab7bab68638e-3
00:45:53.868 --> 00:45:57.611
rectangle, maybe. I'm not quite
sure. The bird's paying

c74f2e5a-0c0c-4b05-b643-ab7bab68638e-4
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:58.280
attention.

63d24e81-de8a-4653-930c-e432b135ebe7-0
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.050
What are they gonna do next?

284e1573-52c7-4911-badb-ce800d21b15d-0
00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.870
Oh, magic carpet. Fantastic. So.

11485012-f45f-4fc4-8c23-b6e01f1c33ce-0
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:11.402
She seems right at home on her
magic carpet and there's an

11485012-f45f-4fc4-8c23-b6e01f1c33ce-1
00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:15.220
absolutely beautiful view of
that, you know, Royal City down

11485012-f45f-4fc4-8c23-b6e01f1c33ce-2
00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.225
below. She's following the bird
who seems to have turned white.

11485012-f45f-4fc4-8c23-b6e01f1c33ce-3
00:46:19.225 --> 00:46:23.294
It might just be the time of day
and, you know, light reflecting

11485012-f45f-4fc4-8c23-b6e01f1c33ce-4
00:46:23.294 --> 00:46:23.919
off of it.

dd426310-2242-459b-9c95-7f44a7fa572d-0
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.389
But they're off on a mission
somewhere. I have no idea what

dd426310-2242-459b-9c95-7f44a7fa572d-1
00:46:27.389 --> 00:46:28.040
they're up to.

007d9555-14d5-4116-b2c4-2703b30607ce-0
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.559
OK, she's following the bird and
now it's night time and the sky

007d9555-14d5-4116-b2c4-2703b30607ce-1
00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:34.470
is full of stars.

b8c8a356-d754-40bf-9ad9-55f6dccbaef7-0
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.078
They're heading back to that
wild tropical island, maybe

b8c8a356-d754-40bf-9ad9-55f6dccbaef7-1
00:46:39.078 --> 00:46:41.380
because we can see one palm
tree.

a5e4475b-edc1-41fd-8deb-6755c07e146e-0
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:45.590
And they only had to Oh my gosh,
look at that.

a12d06fd-5251-4a4a-b958-1155700aad60-0
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:50.010
So they've landed, and there's a
doorway.

d587f580-5c61-44e9-b0c9-426ec28b2f08-0
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.780
At the foot of the pie palm
tree, the bird is waiting there

d587f580-5c61-44e9-b0c9-426ec28b2f08-1
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.180
for her. He's arrived ahead and.

effa05bf-8002-403f-ab00-6c542d3e63a5-0
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.817
It's a purple door, the same
shade as bird, and they both go

effa05bf-8002-403f-ab00-6c542d3e63a5-1
00:47:02.817 --> 00:47:03.010
in.

a8d54bfb-b4a1-40ae-b451-bc1a4cfa1819-0
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:10.821
And they come out in the city.
Ohh my gosh. And she arrives out

a8d54bfb-b4a1-40ae-b451-bc1a4cfa1819-1
00:47:10.821 --> 00:47:15.754
of what looks like a mailbox and
that's her door back into her

a8d54bfb-b4a1-40ae-b451-bc1a4cfa1819-2
00:47:15.754 --> 00:47:20.687
city reality. She's brought the
purple bird to her friend, her

a8d54bfb-b4a1-40ae-b451-bc1a4cfa1819-3
00:47:20.687 --> 00:47:22.410
original travel buddy.

24c6cc95-e129-4b20-bd00-f02cdcbd9b78-0
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:28.334
And he's got his purple wand,
and the three of them are

24c6cc95-e129-4b20-bd00-f02cdcbd9b78-1
00:47:28.334 --> 00:47:29.120
together.

5618a862-bae5-4371-a571-2ac106c7b5dd-0
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:31.770
at last again.

20989550-c972-459f-a888-c941d72ae97d-0
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.673
But they're not finished.
They're busy drawing a red

20989550-c972-459f-a888-c941d72ae97d-1
00:47:35.673 --> 00:47:39.062
circle and a purple circle. Gosh
only knows what's going to

20989550-c972-459f-a888-c941d72ae97d-2
00:47:39.062 --> 00:47:39.740
happen next.

cab3aeaa-f314-42cb-aca2-214c1d007807-0
00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:47.829
Oh the bicycle, that's the two.
That's two person, 2 wheel

cab3aeaa-f314-42cb-aca2-214c1d007807-1
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:50.390
color, two colored wheels.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.015
Bicycle. That was in the very
first page of this story. And

1cba5cb7-058a-4b51-a3f0-22da999e71ba-1
00:47:55.015 --> 00:47:58.930
off they go, racing with the
bird behind them. #END_journey

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:06.580
I'm going to have to get this
book.

998b417a-3858-4d65-9862-a1d2514adec7-0
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.410
Yeah, the art is so pretty.

2e4bb09d-9169-48af-a3e7-b3911664b59f-0
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.620
It is charming. Really charming.

c017a641-213f-4246-b5d1-cab9492b784f-0
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.020
Next is a complex scene.

b0f0a9b6-c9f9-4f55-9636-65fec83d2a2e-0
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.330
Birthday party fun. Oh my gosh.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.310
Right, OK, so this is just a
scene, so describe what you see.

00:48:52.883 --> 00:48:57.360
sure. And they have one of those
blow up inflatable castles with

4a12c4cf-1098-4845-bf59-286b86e0b8b5-2
00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.769
people having the greatest time.
They're in crocodile costumes,

4a12c4cf-1098-4845-bf59-286b86e0b8b5-3
00:49:01.769 --> 00:49:02.940
witch's costumes.

There there are some.

d684acda-d16f-4cf8-a231-cc66a5d5be85-0
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:21.964
Ghostly kind of Halloween
characters up there too, Uh

d684acda-d16f-4cf8-a231-cc66a5d5be85-1
00:49:21.964 --> 00:49:27.320
elephant, someone in a Penguin,
and a lion and zebra costume.

327b8999-f771-4455-b33e-5bffdb974b72-0
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.908
As well, everyone's having a
great time and they're thronging

327b8999-f771-4455-b33e-5bffdb974b72-1
00:49:31.908 --> 00:49:33.610
here. There are some clowns.

759f26cb-42b2-4537-8caa-4c80a639abfd-0
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.380
Superman.

1c2b8c79-05d8-42a5-a9aa-c02ef5140a68-0
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:41.992
They have. No, I haven't seen
Waldo yet. There's a robber

1c2b8c79-05d8-42a5-a9aa-c02ef5140a68-1
00:49:41.992 --> 00:49:42.820
character.

725852d7-bc15-4fe2-96d1-f68c1b449924-0
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.635
So it seems to be a big costume
party. That's the kind of

725852d7-bc15-4fe2-96d1-f68c1b449924-1
00:49:47.635 --> 00:49:51.190
birthday party fun that they're
having. There are costumes

725852d7-bc15-4fe2-96d1-f68c1b449924-2
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.806
throughout this entire party and
it's taking place inside a

725852d7-bc15-4fe2-96d1-f68c1b449924-3
00:49:54.806 --> 00:49:55.710
fenced in area.

6f005e21-adf0-4925-af79-82e75226d7b9-0
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.880
Grassy.

2a5b22e9-64e5-4eda-ba7c-ac4743cf13f5-0
00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.880
Inside there with a few nice
trees from the looks of it.

1007b5e6-35e6-4205-b959-d9e89a1a1f84-0
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.980
People are very busy. There's an
inflatable pool.

4c789adf-1703-4109-9f2b-a89e70ddb36e-0
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:07.830
There is.

4aec0497-f570-4885-97ab-1fc452af6db3-0
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.950
Oh, beautiful. Maybe.

eb633096-a1a9-435d-a4b1-305cad14d704-0
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.850
Six layer birthday cake pink.

c7f7c0e2-ffd0-4ddc-a40a-465eea7aa673-0
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.808
And there's lots of food on this
table. There are balloons, not

c7f7c0e2-ffd0-4ddc-a40a-465eea7aa673-1
00:50:20.808 --> 00:50:22.290
too too many, but there's.

1247372a-e98f-4ac7-90c5-de2169d71e21-0
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.866
One set, two sets of balloons
that I can see well, haven't

1247372a-e98f-4ac7-90c5-de2169d71e21-1
00:50:26.866 --> 00:50:30.402
figured out whose birthday it is
yet for someone in the

1247372a-e98f-4ac7-90c5-de2169d71e21-2
00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:32.550
strawberry outfit, Tarzan
outfit.

8b5b3d45-06c2-49fb-b4b9-addc0e4356b8-0
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:38.000
Ohh someone in a blindfold with
oh they have a piñata.

587079c9-3777-4176-9323-b3945e2f7ab5-0
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.991
Going oh, here comes the
birthday cake. Now I see it. So

587079c9-3777-4176-9323-b3945e2f7ab5-1
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:44.540
the birthday cakes being carried
to the table.

c4f7ce8a-5193-4ae6-ab51-d1c7702465e5-0
00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:50.673
And it's got pink frosting on
two, maybe three very fat

c4f7ce8a-5193-4ae6-ab51-d1c7702465e5-1
00:50:50.673 --> 00:50:51.340
layers.

5316da4b-da65-4d90-b662-2f07e8bc4c58-0
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.380
And.

d2a22110-8e5d-4a79-a0cb-96bf1fd1c593-0
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.560
I hope they can get everyone's
attention when it's time for the

d2a22110-8e5d-4a79-a0cb-96bf1fd1c593-1
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.790
birthday cake, because you can
tell it's just kind of chaotic.

9a2f7cbd-cbac-43a1-8fc9-cb58f935621f-0
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.680
Scene here but everyone's

66bf040d-d2d8-4510-b97c-ee6d3bf76fde-0
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:07.400
Having.

36654229-674e-4b79-a13c-698e34c95586-0
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.940
A good time they seem to be
getting.

fde010d3-f9e2-44ff-b4fc-fbc47fe3a72f-0
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.660
Doing exactly what they came
for: partying.

bcbe68cd-2bcf-481b-98ba-7c81e6a5b1a4-0
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.890
{Yeah, no Waldo yet.

96a1f1c6-5d2d-4271-85f2-622674b8cfc9-0
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:28.132
Waldo seems to have taken Friday
evening off. This one I don't

96a1f1c6-5d2d-4271-85f2-622674b8cfc9-1
00:51:28.132 --> 00:51:31.980
think has Waldo. I think it's
all different. It has.

7ff756aa-f3aa-4e4b-ac05-ebbbd0d6e568-0
00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:36.280
Yeah, this one's not a worsfold.

a27ea4a0-d218-4798-925e-e49772baa62a-0
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.310
Great. Thanks.}

57ce5c05-480b-4d4a-9c9c-a32114e6bd3b-0
00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.090
Oh, I see the mom and the dad, I
think. #END_birthday_party_fun

a50e6861-af7f-4e35-b88a-ae46966b18bd-0
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.280
OK, perfect.

d87873fa-0cfb-40d7-b44a-02727404ca03-0
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:58.560
OK, next one is a short story.

b5687930-912e-43d6-bce9-10df89d4443e-0
00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.760
This one has four slides.

4c8fc637-1a24-4153-8e02-cd559f1c1892-0
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:20.875
OK. You could begin when you're
ready and then tell me when to

4c8fc637-1a24-4153-8e02-cd559f1c1892-1
00:52:20.875 --> 00:52:22.330
move on to the next slide.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:24.620
#START_arrival_5 Alrighty, so.

aebe167e-bd05-4362-9fba-6974149c9cf3-0
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.150
This is very interesting.

5b8e9fc8-cf32-4ead-9ca5-a03b28a684ef-0
00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:37.110
Village hillside and it's it's
mythic. There's what looks like.

422a9a9e-3778-4837-b442-6f4369356b35-0
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.040
Guardian.

d9dd2731-edb2-4638-bf77-1ab778d00df3-0
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.090
Birds, owl like birds.

7d1b7ee6-893c-40d1-afe2-41051e9ca4a0-0
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.190
Statues. Big, you know,

e0113ad7-5593-42ae-b4e6-6fd4ac97c2e7-0
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:54.103
Brick or whatever commemorative
statues up on the hill. And

e0113ad7-5593-42ae-b4e6-6fd4ac97c2e7-1
00:52:54.103 --> 00:52:57.200
there's flocks and flocks of
birds swarming around.

d2f6739a-2c71-412b-9b9d-16f82937a8d7-0
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:02.160
Ohh my goodness, this is
actually there's a canal, many

d2f6739a-2c71-412b-9b9d-16f82937a8d7-1
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.080
many boats, so it almost looks
like Venice in the hills.

84aa6da1-aff7-4b98-882e-e15b467b3a81-0
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.090
And.

5ee999ff-1dd4-42d1-b2d0-ddfed89e2442-0
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.680
That's the first picture I'm
looking at. Now.

f99ac97e-3706-4649-9afd-fa3625f3f750-0
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.642
Trying to see what's happening
exactly. It looks like someone's

f99ac97e-3706-4649-9afd-fa3625f3f750-1
00:53:15.642 --> 00:53:17.840
maybe tied up their boat to
this. Interesting.

278deebb-58b6-4c08-a179-7bba5983d219-0
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.170
Interesting.

e8c5550c-446a-4605-87e9-90b53a7d6ea8-0
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:22.630
It appears.

da4318ac-9fe7-4744-83f4-7fb8014da0e7-0
00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:26.230
And it appears that it's the
father.

0ebaa9ae-e0f4-4b20-8acf-a783e885f79a-0
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:31.016
On his journey still and he's
arrived somewhere, he's being

0ebaa9ae-e0f4-4b20-8acf-a783e885f79a-1
00:53:31.016 --> 00:53:32.950
greeted and shown where to go.

31c40cba-daa5-4dcd-9a94-398cf23ab307-0
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:39.288
There is that Dragon character,
I think the shadow of the tail

31c40cba-daa5-4dcd-9a94-398cf23ab307-1
00:53:39.288 --> 00:53:43.858
that we saw on the House he was
leaving, where he left his wife

31c40cba-daa5-4dcd-9a94-398cf23ab307-2
00:53:43.858 --> 00:53:48.500
and daughter, appears to show up
here in the upper right corner.

31536675-3c94-4c6b-b6ce-af8d5c38c5aa-0
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.480
So the drawing and then the next
one too, but.

0fcaa537-7cb5-41b2-833b-5a5f67f33bf8-0
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.353
So there were people in this
city. He's dressed in dark, and

0fcaa537-7cb5-41b2-833b-5a5f67f33bf8-1
00:53:56.353 --> 00:53:57.590
they're all light, and they're.

6f50c660-c3b6-42b4-ab3c-ee06ce8330cd-0
00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:01.363
They're very lovely people.
They're welcoming him. It's

6f50c660-c3b6-42b4-ab3c-ee06ce8330cd-1
00:54:01.363 --> 00:54:02.560
appears to be a family.

10e50f16-9636-4e5a-83e1-cc5a7cfca621-0
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:06.650
People getting together and
they're toasting his arrival.

935be05b-6933-457b-bb1c-31bb78887240-0
00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:10.160
So they've been waiting for him
to arrive. It looks like.

4114b3d7-09b2-4b75-9b94-4ca53e879c28-0
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.291
It's got there. There's some
very unusual vegetables or

4114b3d7-09b2-4b75-9b94-4ca53e879c28-1
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:16.350
fruits that are being prepared
and.

e6cfbf67-96d3-4c73-8220-d960aa865b4b-0
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.308
guess they'll be eating them. I
don't know what's going to come

e6cfbf67-96d3-4c73-8220-d960aa865b4b-1
00:54:21.308 --> 00:54:21.630
of that.

ea58a697-45aa-4eaf-af78-3aa151818e36-0
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:27.392
OK. Is there another another
page? Oh, yeah, there we go.

ea58a697-45aa-4eaf-af78-3aa151818e36-1
00:54:27.392 --> 00:54:30.700
Yep, they're having a feast.
Wow. Very exotic.

d2dfcc02-e054-4756-82a3-f6cf19faf378-0
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.280
Dinner that they're having and
there's.

dee498e6-4be5-44d5-86af-366d597601d9-0
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.390
Fascinating lights in this home.

13c15248-771b-4a30-a6c3-49837c6dcc3c-0
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.900
They are very otherworldly, kind
of dreamlike.

96247bdb-580f-4b62-b030-873f02059bc3-0
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:47.318
Everyone's drinking wine and
laughing and eating and they're

96247bdb-580f-4b62-b030-873f02059bc3-1
00:54:47.318 --> 00:54:51.260
very good mood. And then playing
music after dinner with

96247bdb-580f-4b62-b030-873f02059bc3-2
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.090
instruments.

f6b1d1da-e8e1-4175-90f0-c3cde6e992ab-0
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.140
There are also kind of fantasy.

14ffb855-da22-4173-8787-8fdef91cd973-0
00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.996
Versions of instruments that we
use, there's an accordion with

14ffb855-da22-4173-8787-8fdef91cd973-1
00:55:01.996 --> 00:55:03.310
all kinds of little.

5ef2eace-5864-4a8e-bae6-6728e724eaf3-0
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.150
Trumpet.

b45df2ea-4b76-4990-bc4b-e9fc08bf8d67-0
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:11.983
Additions to it and a woman
paying playing a flute that's

b45df2ea-4b76-4990-bc4b-e9fc08bf8d67-1
00:55:11.983 --> 00:55:15.569
got a curved end that's really
looks a lot like the city that

b45df2ea-4b76-4990-bc4b-e9fc08bf8d67-2
00:55:15.569 --> 00:55:16.610
they're living in.

ab2adfb8-a78e-4bc6-80b2-22a911d0ef46-0
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.650
The boy's playing a banjo of
sorts and now the.

487f1724-ced3-4bed-bb63-7fe40f51e45a-0
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:26.742
The fantasy animals are showing
up. I suppose that's cat house

487f1724-ced3-4bed-bb63-7fe40f51e45a-1
00:55:26.742 --> 00:55:30.823
cat and the dad is now making a
paper version, an origami

487f1724-ced3-4bed-bb63-7fe40f51e45a-2
00:55:30.823 --> 00:55:32.160
version of the cat.

6bbc22a6-9785-426d-b670-f992f431cfd9-0
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.147
And gives it to, I think, the
son, who's wearing a hat for a

6bbc22a6-9785-426d-b670-f992f431cfd9-1
00:55:38.147 --> 00:55:38.680
moment.

bb519756-bc87-4104-a174-60a2cd8b08b8-0
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.230
And they've got.

cdf997e3-c887-4f07-873f-8a7a3cc88760-0
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:45.959
A very special kind of urn that
they've just taken out of the

cdf997e3-c887-4f07-873f-8a7a3cc88760-1
00:55:45.959 --> 00:55:49.567
cupboard. Looks like they're
offering it to the traveler. I

cdf997e3-c887-4f07-873f-8a7a3cc88760-2
00:55:49.567 --> 00:55:50.470
don't know why.

fb3b7a1f-43ed-41ac-b4b0-9a1d3d5530ca-0
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.290
We can go to the next one.

c2a1cc7a-2b69-4cbe-9c21-ac642f2a32d8-0
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:59.200
Yeah, there's that urn. It's
being set down.

8b220861-9517-4314-a2ca-8fa0b04b964b-0
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.810
In a

51bf9cec-0d39-46b6-99bb-9e5ac2144c92-0
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.860
An area that's lit.

351357fc-0a33-4dc0-9369-bb27da193429-0
00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.540


c9266603-fa06-46bd-81f4-54d00bc01714-0
00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.680
The traveler is sleeping, but.

d2d7a4af-f3c4-4def-a8d2-a95c228a8fd0-0
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.462
Turtle kind of thing. Maybe some
kind of a strange animal is

d2d7a4af-f3c4-4def-a8d2-a95c228a8fd0-1
00:56:15.462 --> 00:56:17.490
coming up to him in the night.

e6970e39-8dfe-4973-897f-5ae232b96657-0
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.153
Ohh my gosh, I don't know. He's
gonna eat it or no. He's made

e6970e39-8dfe-4973-897f-5ae232b96657-1
00:56:22.153 --> 00:56:25.151
cutting of fruit, so he's
getting dressed, putting on his

e6970e39-8dfe-4973-897f-5ae232b96657-2
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:28.354
shirt. He's cutting a piece of
fruit which almost looked like

e6970e39-8dfe-4973-897f-5ae232b96657-3
00:56:28.354 --> 00:56:28.819
that cat.

a672b396-a554-43af-8510-025358e8055c-0
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.420
And he's feeding the cat.

d330463a-8df5-4761-b909-e0654fed89c5-0
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.870
And the cat.

8f22e68a-ae20-41bb-89a6-f49627cd5727-0
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.390
That crazy cat is bringing him
his hat. So he's being.

b9649dee-da49-4752-a3d5-b1c2b5deb049-0
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.570
Sent on his way.

c852acb6-3533-47cc-8f39-1b2417d22ff8-0
00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.690
{We can go to the next page.}

f72985c9-8dfa-43c8-a079-26d558125edc-0
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:45.870
OK.

c8705b1b-c2e3-4718-8094-0eea336fab4c-0
00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:51.528
He's out walking with this cat
is accompanying him and he's

c8705b1b-c2e3-4718-8094-0eea336fab4c-1
00:56:51.528 --> 00:56:55.671
walking on the street. Some
other people have are being

c8705b1b-c2e3-4718-8094-0eea336fab4c-2
00:56:55.671 --> 00:57:00.332
accompanied by animals and he
goes to a door and a man in kind

c8705b1b-c2e3-4718-8094-0eea336fab4c-3
00:57:00.332 --> 00:57:04.844
of an Asian costume wearing
something that almost looks like

c8705b1b-c2e3-4718-8094-0eea336fab4c-4
00:57:04.844 --> 00:57:07.359
a crown, but a very fancy hat
is.

715a9f83-b03f-4d27-bee3-2b3ea9d6cd02-0
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.340
Greeting him at the door, he's
headed inside.

40475e86-2f76-4543-8c7e-1a07db73982e-0
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.660
Whoops, something's happening.

08ec6ab8-02fb-4a56-b68c-e28327cce50f-0
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:17.500
{Ohh I sorry I didn't see that
first.

20067359-4318-438b-8c61-b43e01379786-0
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:21.600
Couldn't do the whole left page
first I went across the top.}

b0501fe6-2c57-4da7-9cc5-af4d98e99177-0
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:26.090
So yeah, there's some kind of
altercation there, but then.

147128b1-5dc9-447d-a6e1-6c2e9ea4f7f3-0
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.797
That calms down. There's a man
in a Mexican hat and I don't

147128b1-5dc9-447d-a6e1-6c2e9ea4f7f3-1
00:57:30.797 --> 00:57:33.290
know what he's doing. Feeding
fish, maybe.

693508cd-e0e4-487b-8e5e-6f9fb3db3408-0
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.730
Definitely a fantasy world.

e9d6d74f-76a7-4fef-83da-631c47389edc-0
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.080
Very interesting scenes.

7b07097c-c50d-46f7-ade4-afda37b9cff8-0
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.260
Yeah, he's being greeted.

f90583a6-c9ae-44ce-a0d7-0c4fd4021f03-0
00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.248
Talk to it's not. He's not
really being welcomed, but he's

f90583a6-c9ae-44ce-a0d7-0c4fd4021f03-1
00:57:49.248 --> 00:57:53.267
getting directions, I think from
a variety of people. Ohh, there

f90583a6-c9ae-44ce-a0d7-0c4fd4021f03-2
00:57:53.267 --> 00:57:56.482
you go. And they've led him to
what looks like some

f90583a6-c9ae-44ce-a0d7-0c4fd4021f03-3
00:57:56.482 --> 00:58:00.007
transportation. Whether it's
going to be air or water, I

f90583a6-c9ae-44ce-a0d7-0c4fd4021f03-4
00:58:00.007 --> 00:58:03.470
don't know, but you can see a
propeller. #END_arrival_5

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.150
To go to the next one.

9430fa25-95d6-4fb6-b313-5e4fceb65ff7-0
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:07.630
Ohh.

fcd1900a-2e58-4b98-b806-2fa45d1c3e00-0
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.980
Except for that one. Let me see
what we have.

d29d4fd7-80f3-441f-967c-6ccf1bc8fb75-0
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.330
Next. OK, Next is a complex
scene.

93f6b438-d98c-4705-a83c-ec7284c3830d-0
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:25.740
Complex is right.

2f519117-7221-4a08-91c5-e4d3ed328fc8-0
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.730
Here.

5284d613-1b6b-4297-a214-006fa6c94e76-0
00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.280
OK.

40fe5fff-7db1-4dce-b68a-9833672a6f32-0
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.618
There you go so Just describe
what you see in this scene and I

40fe5fff-7db1-4dce-b68a-9833672a6f32-1
00:58:43.618 --> 00:58:45.000
will set a timer.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:47.290
OK.

028fb229-39ff-4f38-ac5a-6074da7f4074-0
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:53.667
#START_campsite OK, so here we
are again. And people seem to be

028fb229-39ff-4f38-ac5a-6074da7f4074-1
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:58.603
amusing themselves. They're,
they're in a beautiful area.

028fb229-39ff-4f38-ac5a-6074da7f4074-2
00:58:58.603 --> 00:59:03.200
Interesting. There's a waterway
and there's, there's.

27541882-9d89-4993-ad55-edca17cd7b11-0
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:09.446
A couple of boats, not a lot,
but Oh my gosh, yeah, it's a

27541882-9d89-4993-ad55-edca17cd7b11-1
00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:12.120
trailer park. There's a tent
area.

fcbc92c0-f9b2-4de0-b5b9-52f0c0254ace-0
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:18.986
There I think it's a Boy Scout
troop over on the right, upper

fcbc92c0-f9b2-4de0-b5b9-52f0c0254ace-1
00:59:18.986 --> 00:59:20.390
right area corner.

31848155-c046-4576-990b-661a48f2332e-0
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.030
People do a lot of vacationing
in these, these photos. There's.

f2286d73-04aa-4d68-b8ef-960f1ef74024-0
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.570
Horses or.

80188f6d-ec69-4f6f-9b3b-964f4ba4cf10-0
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.360
Donkeys.

2a0a189d-2d77-496b-ad97-1c5022129982-0
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:31.790
Maybe there?

bf5fe220-1ed0-44b5-b8b6-9ce4f5ae0bfa-0
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:33.780
There.

83f3e778-4e9c-4d9c-b409-b5e44c8585ad-0
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:37.310
I see it

8820e619-69f5-4c70-8ff9-e2b861fd4278-0
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:42.330
So funny, there's hikers that
are.

7f05002f-43cb-46bb-a950-a52190b58445-0
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:46.363
Making it look as though they're
going up a mountain, but they

7f05002f-43cb-46bb-a950-a52190b58445-1
00:59:46.363 --> 00:59:46.720
aren't.

a83dbcbf-ee18-4edf-918f-48804dea3219-0
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.375
They may be practicing hiking.
They have their backpacks on and

a83dbcbf-ee18-4edf-918f-48804dea3219-1
00:59:53.375 --> 00:59:56.190
their staff, and they're
following this walkway.

19fd0a94-27ad-4c75-bd21-17e03e806204-0
00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:58.840
Which leads to the river.

fb97276c-5496-48e6-ba86-f22fbdbc03f7-0
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:04.080
A lot of people walking just
kind of sightseeing.

f1e91690-025a-49d2-879f-7b76b0ece042-0
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.690
Sure, there's a lot of activity
in and around tents.

7fe3f5d6-cd25-4ebd-bde5-27d09c2b7410-0
01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:12.930
tents.

0ae22627-65c1-4f34-a727-a97f06cd1af7-0
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:15.880
Some people are wearing uniforms
you can see.

4c10a99d-c9ab-4372-8a3d-d98e51ed2558-0
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.436
Few people in a particular group
dressed in the same kind of way.

4c10a99d-c9ab-4372-8a3d-d98e51ed2558-1
01:00:21.436 --> 01:00:23.480
There's a tent being set up.

738e2059-7454-45f1-9772-76add44cfcc5-0
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.440
There's

f30b2e4f-6d96-4ba3-b099-d48b477b789d-0
01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.380
People gathering and eating.

9bc44bcf-98ac-44dd-94f7-717de689fb30-0
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.080
Yeah, a lot of people with.

3ab6a5ca-eda9-413b-8a85-b7b9b1d14c6b-0
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.430
It appeared to be hikers.

6fabfd6e-690f-49d7-8011-71aecab3c2d0-0
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.000
in all these different areas.

3179d42a-6fb7-4fa2-aa2d-4e1eb37c75e8-0
01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:45.406
I love the caravan area where
they have the campers. They're

3179d42a-6fb7-4fa2-aa2d-4e1eb37c75e8-1
01:00:45.406 --> 01:00:47.380
really charming with the.

3dc9aee9-7fb2-45f3-98ee-11122838c972-0
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.926
Vehicles, campers, right. Little
trailers. I don't know how they

3dc9aee9-7fb2-45f3-98ee-11122838c972-1
01:00:52.926 --> 01:00:57.501
got there because there are no
cars being shown, but they're in

3dc9aee9-7fb2-45f3-98ee-11122838c972-2
01:00:57.501 --> 01:01:01.290
place and people are like
evidently staying in them.

988ce28f-a765-4ba4-999e-3169d32f4777-0
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.280
You can see the in the distance
that there are hills and trees.

988ce28f-a765-4ba4-999e-3169d32f4777-1
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.430
It's a very pretty natural area.

8573dfe3-b7d7-4f8a-bde0-9707f995b72a-0
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.581
And it looks as though it's all
manicured, because maybe it's in

8573dfe3-b7d7-4f8a-bde0-9707f995b72a-1
01:01:15.581 --> 01:01:20.251
a farming area. There are
rectangles bordered by shrubs

8573dfe3-b7d7-4f8a-bde0-9707f995b72a-2
01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:22.670
and trees of different kinds.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.700
Openness in the middle of it.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.160
See a unicycle.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.690
And a couple of bikes in the
upper right hand corner.

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:36.140
There's a man fishing. There
are.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.650
People biking in the center and
one biker in the center.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.726
Oh yeah, so there's a really
beautiful roadway that borders

273ccdcc-e0a2-4595-b64e-4593a8449a8d-1
01:01:49.726 --> 01:01:50.520
this canal.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:55.230
People though are walking and
enjoying.

07dfbafc-cfdf-47af-957e-7ae12e3fa56c-0
01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.980
Taking in the entire area,
{saying wake up Waldo. Friends,

07dfbafc-cfdf-47af-957e-7ae12e3fa56c-1
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:05.346
have you ever seen mermaids?}
Yep, I see two mermaids out

07dfbafc-cfdf-47af-957e-7ae12e3fa56c-2
01:02:05.346 --> 01:02:09.937
there. The blondes near the man
who's fishing. {We're seeing

07dfbafc-cfdf-47af-957e-7ae12e3fa56c-3
01:02:09.937 --> 01:02:14.679
mermaids in a canal or flowers
painted all over a tent}. There

07dfbafc-cfdf-47af-957e-7ae12e3fa56c-4
01:02:14.679 --> 01:02:16.110
is the flower tent.

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.622
{Or a line of hikers winding
along the country lanes I have

01:02:20.622 --> 01:02:24.016
today. It was just amazing.} OK,
they're hikers. It's not that

d54ae5ca-68ed-4c68-b9d2-fe5cb3d12c17-2
01:02:24.016 --> 01:02:27.033
they're heading for the
mountains, they're just hiking,

01:02:27.033 --> 01:02:30.373
even though they have staffs,
but just to make them stronger.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.340

scene.

ready.

differently, some of these are

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:40.298
Group of what looks like the
kind of things you put on your

a massive refrigerator here with

77968e9a-0676-4b62-bc44-52e459fec24c-2

Places.

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:52.600
Perhaps, but definitely more
people and.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.640
Animals.

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:59.080
Like even a robot in one of them
I'm seeing.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.210
Little hippo and.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.445
They're interesting, all right.
They're each of them is framed

4e34927d-fbd7-446d-b861-c76c13d1359b-1
01:04:06.445 --> 01:04:09.690
in little brown. Not wood,
probably, but painted frame or

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:10.809
something like that.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.510
And sumo wrestlers.

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.350
Bags of money and.

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.000
Fish with legs.

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:29.411
It's just there are a lot of
fantasy characters, sort of

c928038f-3df3-4479-94e3-683527cb74e6-1
01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:31.500
magical hobbits with pointed
hats.

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:33.230
from the looks of it.

380578f3-0ec0-4c90-b19c-cfd1ca64956c-0
01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.210
There's one tree visible.

b1d90e4e-bbad-4a18-a6ab-38cc4e0d9c0f-0
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.170
It's not Waldo, but someones
leaning against a tree.

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.960
Otherwise it's more close-ups of
people and.

542b6c31-de34-49b7-8599-e3b81cd0651a-0
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:47.190
And a few animals with them.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.762
To say there's a variety of
character here, characters here

01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.830
is one of the greatest
understatements.

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:57.760
Because.

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.444
They're all kind of crazy.
There's a stick figure. It

42c7e731-0423-43e3-99b6-030435a8c033-1
01:05:01.444 --> 01:05:02.980
almost looks like a cactus
running.

41d500cc-71d2-44fd-adac-3d0ba91c3262-0
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.590
Personification of a cactus.

be769db4-592c-4920-8cdb-070ee19a9db2-0
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:15.180
The clarity on this photo is not
great, but I see Knights and

be769db4-592c-4920-8cdb-070ee19a9db2-1
01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:15.890
Cavemen.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.640
And.

3f4d1c6d-3cf3-49a0-ade8-af44caf8b5c1-0
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.780
A Unicorn? No, no. Some kind of
a dragon.

c464da99-d5ae-467c-ba66-8b8aea77890e-0
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:27.340
Horse that's thinking.

8bf78cdb-9f94-465c-aa7b-44dbe15a5fcd-0
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.990
Bear tapping a guy on the
shoulder.

de2f933d-c353-45e5-abff-11cca0a1e2fc-0
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:40.696
Hand, very unusual hand on the
right hand side of this thing

de2f933d-c353-45e5-abff-11cca0a1e2fc-1
01:05:40.696 --> 01:05:45.131
here. Fingers are look like
they've got some kind of a a

de2f933d-c353-45e5-abff-11cca0a1e2fc-2
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:45.910
condition.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.840
Glad I don't have that. There's
a man in the center.

4814e699-d582-416e-9cf5-ec47093cde1f-0
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:55.160
His eyes crossed, startled about
something.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.240
There's a knight from the court
of King Arthur.

0f1eb353-e210-4ebf-be2b-e2e7b12c98c1-0
01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.330
There's a.

King with a very.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.160
Wild looking hat in upper left.
There are sumo wrestlers. I

86c44125-8715-4149-8466-532d9e58034c-1
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.950
think I might have said that
before already.

ac462917-9d33-40db-8870-29f89956a8d0-0
01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.033
Yeah, I think I'm going to be
dreaming some of these insane

ac462917-9d33-40db-8870-29f89956a8d0-1
01:06:19.033 --> 01:06:19.390
scenes.

68c491a4-6eac-4aa8-9baf-dc120d17a216-0
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.850
There's a lot of raw material
here. #END_picture_this

9322abf3-40b6-4233-86ab-c302594f29b6-0
01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520
OK, let's.

d7aa116f-79ee-4ee0-ba01-30e141093c3c-0
01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:39.307
It's kind of overstimulating I
don't understand. I've never

d7aa116f-79ee-4ee0-ba01-30e141093c3c-1
01:06:39.307 --> 01:06:43.075
known anyone who had aphasia,
but I can only imagine it would

d7aa116f-79ee-4ee0-ba01-30e141093c3c-2
01:06:43.075 --> 01:06:44.170
be very confusing.

27f437eb-d125-4d20-bb9b-58cb2e421df2-0
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.280
To try to sort out what was in
that last frame.

28c747d2-bdb9-452f-bc21-38749d858259-0
01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.300
Yeah, there's a lot going on,
yeah.

b4c431bc-ed03-4493-81f0-a4079858f6e8-0
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.910
OK, next we have another complex
scene.

7f5c49ad-95e9-426f-b716-acdf726a46be-0
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.550
Let me.

57854b20-f657-4d86-be2a-255381eaf49b-0
01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.090
So this is also a scene so like
before.

21362ccc-ff65-41fe-98ac-b52fa2d8bc38-0
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.630
Just take 3 to 5 minutes to
describe it.

01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:15.090
OK, I should really have a
laptop for this.

3817cc4c-e8ae-431c-94b5-96cf2e1496b5-1
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:19.472
#START_exhibit_12 It's very hard
to make it out, it's just a

3817cc4c-e8ae-431c-94b5-96cf2e1496b5-2
01:07:19.472 --> 01:07:20.550
massive people.

7b5f7bde-6500-4a3e-a8d3-a9abe6db4c10-0
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.550
Great portrait exhibition. Oh,
how interesting. OK, so.

deff6fd5-4888-4a01-a872-9b7d6ab2a625-0
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:31.570
What we're seeing is a portrait
exhibition, probably in a

deff6fd5-4888-4a01-a872-9b7d6ab2a625-1
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:36.980
museum, and it has three levels
from what I can judge here. I

deff6fd5-4888-4a01-a872-9b7d6ab2a625-2
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.900
can see the stairways.

7576f089-48a5-46c4-8504-09365a8372cb-0
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:43.760
And people must have been
waiting for a very long time for

7576f089-48a5-46c4-8504-09365a8372cb-1
01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.905
this to come because it's come
out in throngs to see this, this

7576f089-48a5-46c4-8504-09365a8372cb-2
01:07:47.905 --> 01:07:49.330
grouping of portraits.

169de50d-c9d7-4d4c-a4da-9a2587d6d3f8-0
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:53.050
There are.

60295392-d66f-49c8-bc2a-e49bdec727dc-0
01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.860
Some of the most unusual.

db4a25d7-1eac-4a2a-b874-dfdf822927b4-0
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.370
Unusually dressed people you can
imagine.

5f32c359-501b-4db3-896f-633f39f03958-0
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.670
Every variety and ethnicity.

5c02225c-93d1-452e-855b-28a60baa706f-0
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.393
And from all the different
centuries, from the look of it.

5c02225c-93d1-452e-855b-28a60baa706f-1
01:08:06.393 --> 01:08:06.790
So it's.

874903aa-ec7f-4362-82b2-4e093685e474-0
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:09.220
It's a historical.

30e1ab73-cdc2-45db-9fd8-9b2ec30bfa6b-0
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:11.970
Mishmash.

ec75373e-fbba-4692-a02a-1ff4db14c770-0
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.280
As well.

97c2e9e1-3597-458d-b824-88da2be96bed-0
01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.803
On the far left middle, it looks
like they're still putting up

97c2e9e1-3597-458d-b824-88da2be96bed-1
01:08:20.803 --> 01:08:24.350
one of the portraits, so even
though this is an exhibition.

8ad4acd6-6e09-4d91-8854-8dc52356074b-0
01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.740
The exhibit is not quite
finished yet. There

c10d8a3d-95d9-4523-a5c7-ead45b7642eb-0
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.892
There's a Workman on a ladder.
Two workmen in overalls on a

c10d8a3d-95d9-4523-a5c7-ead45b7642eb-1
01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:33.370
ladder.

d7724d23-9382-47e9-a06f-c95dc83bfd19-0
01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.822
Finishing hanging things Ohh and
over on the the right at that

d7724d23-9382-47e9-a06f-c95dc83bfd19-1
01:08:38.822 --> 01:08:41.610
same level it looks as though
either.

9bebb24e-c997-425a-9ec4-4484e709c707-0
01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.910
Nope, Nope. It looks as though
some portraits are being stolen.

90c4ad33-96e1-4830-8cfc-398f3aa54722-0
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:49.320
By people acting up in the
crowd.

c44ec65e-6f7a-4a57-b66b-0ac4183e12d2-0
01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.319
Crowd is so massive that they're
probably going to get away with

c44ec65e-6f7a-4a57-b66b-0ac4183e12d2-1
01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:54.490
it.

82a86fd3-7147-4c62-beaf-669152acded1-0
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:59.570
And it almost looks like.

18cf662c-4cd0-46ff-8b70-3037e22c2922-0
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:06.370
Family portraits at the upper
level of the exhibition, except

18cf662c-4cd0-46ff-8b70-3037e22c2922-1
01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:11.420
that I see a cowboy in one of
them, a shark in another.

97900302-2026-4028-8e98-af62cadf0527-0
01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.740
But other than that, there.

f95480cf-13c7-474a-91ab-59f2050216f5-0
01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:16.190
There are definitely some
family.

060c5b30-55f3-4f41-a4c3-3568603969fa-0
01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:18.760
Portraits on that level.

6db6bc7c-ae9f-45cc-92fa-1fdaac8d3504-0
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.390
Whereas the level just below it.

3b75763a-e8c1-4f8f-9ac1-3beade2e666b-0
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.420
There are more individual
portraits, even a portrait of

3b75763a-e8c1-4f8f-9ac1-3beade2e666b-1
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.280
someone in jail.

6c861c83-5c80-4e38-b2a3-4d18a0d2abac-0
01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.428
I don't think you'd really want
your portrait if you're in jail,

6c861c83-5c80-4e38-b2a3-4d18a0d2abac-1
01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:32.200
but there you go.

a02f6d5a-c66d-4487-8257-6c169e0f8e72-0
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.634
And someone with a bizarre
mustache and the on the lower

a02f6d5a-c66d-4487-8257-6c169e0f8e72-1
01:09:38.634 --> 01:09:43.300
exhibit wall and it looks like a
monk in a red hooded.

a12423bc-ac58-4c00-b215-94b8ce6b6f46-0
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.960
Robe.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.420
Hung under, perhaps a wolf?
{It's a little bit fuzzy, Megan.

299fc53d-2802-4443-bc04-fbf52f1f1389-1
01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.380
I like the clarity on this one
is not so good.

a76a6c8a-bb2e-4ad8-96aa-d9cb8d744869-0
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.720
Oh yeah, that's yeah, you're
good. You're doing.

9574888a-f481-4be1-a0c5-10e9b798f53b-0
01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.950
You're right. OK. Good.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:01.550
Yep.}

eb1729ed-8abf-484d-ae2a-4fa9ca41bca5-0
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.073
People are just squeezed in here
and there's a lot going on on

eb1729ed-8abf-484d-ae2a-4fa9ca41bca5-1
01:10:07.073 --> 01:10:09.560
the lowest level, a lot of
activity.

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:14.576
There's a palm tree on almost
every one of these complex

51d6e99e-6442-44bc-a287-6875c9ee4f8d-1
01:10:14.576 --> 01:10:16.680
scenes. Here's the palm tree
here.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.270
I don't know why there's a palm
tree.

5b41c5d7-afd8-4723-8006-93b4dca15ad7-0
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.040
People in very exotic costumes.

imaginable. #END_exhibit_12

Yep. Yep. OK, perfect.

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:42.450
OK, next we have another.

01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:45.080
Short story.

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.360
So let me know when you want me
to move on.

7fef7153-e16e-4c44-9d67-89fb9dbe7ec2-0
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:12.340
OK.

66f02d9a-3937-47b1-b404-cd70a0c729f9-0
01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.820
OK, so.

96fe98f1-2079-424f-9271-a1fe4087b444-0
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.750
#START_arrival_3 We're seeing
more city scenes here and.

5d773a6e-cd1c-487e-ae3d-20a865b22401-0
01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:25.191
Looks like he might be a
newspaper carrier, young guy

5d773a6e-cd1c-487e-ae3d-20a865b22401-1
01:11:25.191 --> 01:11:25.780
with a.

856af669-26e3-4d1b-bf13-c8b54cf05691-0
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:31.116
Pork Pie hat, a pork pie, one of
those visor caps, and he's

856af669-26e3-4d1b-bf13-c8b54cf05691-1
01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:35.365
carrying a sign upside down. I
don't know why. And he has more

856af669-26e3-4d1b-bf13-c8b54cf05691-2
01:11:35.365 --> 01:11:39.277
of those signs under his arm.
There's a woman with a very

856af669-26e3-4d1b-bf13-c8b54cf05691-3
01:11:39.277 --> 01:11:43.660
exotic cat. The animals in this
in the story are phenomenal. And

856af669-26e3-4d1b-bf13-c8b54cf05691-4
01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:44.740
then below that.

27331426-7c1f-4c0d-8d72-3059dfa16691-0
01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:51.648
Yeah, it was a little a steaming
pushcart. My Oh yeah, it looks

27331426-7c1f-4c0d-8d72-3059dfa16691-1
01:11:51.648 --> 01:11:53.710
like he's serving tea.

5a70ac00-089a-44ee-9f8a-62826d511ae1-0
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.580
And he also has a a companion
animal who's quite unique.

a21ef6a9-6166-4809-acbf-c091eeb2ce4c-0
01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:04.844
A couple storing huge eggs. Like
dinosaur eggs. It looks like

a21ef6a9-6166-4809-acbf-c091eeb2ce4c-1
01:12:04.844 --> 01:12:06.220
they're for sale.

0dc7657d-f4ae-4afe-9184-f8ccf49c68fa-0
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.450
It's a marketplace. There's a
Barber.

372c378e-8e66-4e09-890b-ce07e9e1a1b1-0
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:14.803
Your snails passing through town
like very exotic animals and

372c378e-8e66-4e09-890b-ce07e9e1a1b1-1
01:12:14.803 --> 01:12:15.180
more.

0e4c8e2a-50e3-4114-9dc9-7bede7b9dae3-0
01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:20.370
Of those fantastic musical
instruments looks like this.

d1628e1e-493f-4ab9-aab0-c19bd44941fa-0
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:26.420
City has a lot of music being
played at any given time.

9b34e8ae-1bc0-4020-855b-408e956fc94e-0
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:31.780
The women sitting, one's
hugging, a rabbit, one's

9b34e8ae-1bc0-4020-855b-408e956fc94e-1
01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.205
knitting. I think once a man or
a woman is describing what

9b34e8ae-1bc0-4020-855b-408e956fc94e-2
01:12:36.205 --> 01:12:38.080
they're seeing in a book.

38185e1f-b493-4574-bfe9-0f8f8fd739be-0
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:42.736
And the dad, who's still
traveling and has a suitcase, is

38185e1f-b493-4574-bfe9-0f8f8fd739be-1
01:12:42.736 --> 01:12:44.910
trying to figure out where he
is.

4674a9d4-a0ba-42bf-a5c4-a47980601f83-0
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:46.520
Yep.

d66e6943-7734-4456-b32f-a09e85070ee6-0
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:51.890
OK, here he is. He's just.

0d20ff5b-6858-490b-81f5-aa071d541ab1-0
01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.670
grabbed a bird, maybe that he's
holding in his hand, I can't

0d20ff5b-6858-490b-81f5-aa071d541ab1-1
01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:58.220
quite see.

6011b8e2-fa29-46c8-945d-fad1b525354e-0
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.570
He's looking up above him.

d97f77a5-bb88-48c6-9944-e97cd65c4070-0
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.200
He's he's not knowing where he
is or where he should be going.

f9bcce2b-9549-41d0-9dc0-3f8fcc5c5a95-0
01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.050
There are strange lights that
star kind of.

a021f5bb-5882-4bc9-92b7-d236eef39f54-0
01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.750
Lights that are falling all
around him.

8a29e8b8-83e2-4a75-aac8-8c291b4756a3-0
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.851
And then a wind blows those
lights and his hat off his head.

8a29e8b8-83e2-4a75-aac8-8c291b4756a3-1
01:13:25.851 --> 01:13:28.900
Luckily he retrieves his hat.

77934e9c-143b-42d0-a814-c428c1aa149e-0
01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:32.330
And appears there's a map on the
ground.

401caaf8-20e7-49a2-b6e3-5340c949111f-0
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:37.059
Under where his his head is
falling. He starts paying

401caaf8-20e7-49a2-b6e3-5340c949111f-1
01:13:37.059 --> 01:13:38.730
attention to that map and.

cebd9616-7f7b-4b0b-b593-5ed745619045-0
01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.587
Using a book that he has is
trying to find his way. I'm

cebd9616-7f7b-4b0b-b593-5ed745619045-1
01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.260
judging.

00795ce3-4bb3-4314-b9f9-5ad2ede3af34-0
01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.810
He meets an exotic man.

9378be9d-9450-482d-8542-c2b0181c6b73-0
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:53.550
And they're having a
conversation.

8d6e4039-261c-405a-a945-ca5c7785a310-0
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:59.575
Perfect. So they don't share a
language. So the dad, the

8d6e4039-261c-405a-a945-ca5c7785a310-1
01:13:59.575 --> 01:14:02.717
husband, the dad is drawing a
bed and lets this fellow know

8d6e4039-261c-405a-a945-ca5c7785a310-2
01:14:02.717 --> 01:14:04.760
he's looking for a room for the
night.

b5486b92-4e50-4cff-88c6-8ca9dedbebbf-0
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:09.107
And the fellow says follow him.
So he does, even though there's

b5486b92-4e50-4cff-88c6-8ca9dedbebbf-1
01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:12.168
a very unusual animal in his
backpack and that fellow's

b5486b92-4e50-4cff-88c6-8ca9dedbebbf-2
01:14:12.168 --> 01:14:13.480
backpack. #END_arrival_3

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.360
OK.

627e128d-6142-4cc8-a073-6177cd2aafad-0
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.490
Let me see what we have.

a3884549-0ec5-4da5-a3ef-07d9af3dc3d0-0
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:29.190
OK, Next is a complex scene.

d91b8217-69cb-4ecc-8858-ee44db7de5ea-0
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:47.030
OK.

c0fa9f92-99b9-4080-960c-211e9361301d-0
01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.800
Ohh, when you're ready you could
start to describe this scene.

244a492a-b33a-4950-9347-636cc84adf69-0
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:58.447
#START_airport OK, this is an
airport, and there are a variety

244a492a-b33a-4950-9347-636cc84adf69-1
01:14:58.447 --> 01:14:59.290
of planes.

ef41b9ce-7cd1-4bb9-afb9-8fcf51b9fa38-0
01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.380
Loaded and a few in the air.

3d7aafa9-d818-42f5-9f9b-5ab1116d089b-0
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:07.852
There are planes from every era,
there's a dirigible. That's what

3d7aafa9-d818-42f5-9f9b-5ab1116d089b-1
01:15:07.852 --> 01:15:11.220
they call them. There's a a
balloon, one of those, you know.

79ac4076-d705-42a0-bf6b-e6ee6191d4d9-0
01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.290
Flying balloons.

7ee80088-f90a-426b-bc83-b8bdfca14d09-0
01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.574
There's what looks like the
Concorde, one of the most

7ee80088-f90a-426b-bc83-b8bdfca14d09-1
01:15:18.574 --> 01:15:23.078
advanced airplanes ever flying
above, and I can see the air

7ee80088-f90a-426b-bc83-b8bdfca14d09-2
01:15:23.078 --> 01:15:24.130
control tower.

94595676-3544-4d92-8cf3-c408d7e47535-0
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:27.440
Oh, this is another Waldo.

fe50d87b-7109-4f07-9963-bbf463643fb4-0
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:29.860
Seizing.

5b113545-7bdb-4c76-b26d-3cca2ab13e1e-0
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:36.487
There are the vehicles that take
passengers to the airplanes to

5b113545-7bdb-4c76-b26d-3cca2ab13e1e-1
01:15:36.487 --> 01:15:39.460
load them in, and there is a
rather large airplane.

11265136-ac03-41dd-af94-6276281a95b9-0
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.370
It's landed and everyone's
exiting.

a3f4380b-d779-422a-9d87-5a29a164cb55-0
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:49.480
And the luggage is being pulled
out by the, by the, by the, the

a3f4380b-d779-422a-9d87-5a29a164cb55-1
01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:49.960
staff.

1c13e759-119d-48b4-9ead-0f350093d3fa-0
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:54.631
There are people all over the
airplane climbing on top.

1c13e759-119d-48b4-9ead-0f350093d3fa-1
01:15:54.631 --> 01:15:55.700
There's a large.

3752e6d3-01ff-47c5-a53b-d7c88159bd98-0
01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:02.470
Case coming out of the back.
That's probably the food.

5ca644f5-e772-47e0-9228-a49fc8744162-0
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:07.651
The case being unloaded so they
can fill it up and get it ready

5ca644f5-e772-47e0-9228-a49fc8744162-1
01:16:07.651 --> 01:16:10.800
for the next one. So yeah, very
busy airport.

494cf7ad-9155-4ae2-a9c4-6510f1ff554c-0
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.770
Everything's being transported.

84ef1739-4145-4138-a16b-4981de2b6e11-0
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:16.940
People know what they're doing.

79c24161-edfb-426b-968c-590426104f0e-0
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:20.670
But there's a lot going on in
every sector.

52f6eaba-74df-404b-841c-ab79da534281-0
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:24.780
And then down below.

fafef640-717c-4cfb-bf93-a701297b0bdc-0
01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.810
What it looks like here, but
it's the.

04654f84-9c31-40bf-8b26-9771e64f834c-0
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:34.664
The interior of the airport and
the the the desks and so forth.

04654f84-9c31-40bf-8b26-9771e64f834c-1
01:16:34.664 --> 01:16:39.130
And everyone's getting their
tickets. People are arriving.

7f17cd35-0bc4-42cf-b64f-3277554159a8-0
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:41.550
They're putting their.

13c46575-bcd9-4219-b75f-1a2aedaeb891-0
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:45.380
Ohh yeah the ohh that's the
their

08574a8b-065b-4b26-847d-90f63b419502-0
01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.660
The baggage claim is there.

87f7b1a0-bd0c-4f47-8988-e0990c7e353f-0
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:54.044
And all the different airport
desks are there. So Yep, an

87f7b1a0-bd0c-4f47-8988-e0990c7e353f-1
01:16:54.044 --> 01:16:57.105
airplane has arrived and I'm
sure people are going to be

87f7b1a0-bd0c-4f47-8988-e0990c7e353f-2
01:16:57.105 --> 01:16:58.180
exiting the airport.

5951d1e3-02ef-4740-a205-a15dd11ee45a-0
01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.760
One of the most unusual airports
I've ever seen.

8d8a5935-a999-4b64-9ee5-3c506e0500b0-0
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.926
Yeah, something something crazy
going on in the middle there. Oh

8d8a5935-a999-4b64-9ee5-3c506e0500b0-1
01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:12.350
look, there's a fire.

74881dda-b5e8-4441-97cb-16c3bf4c8071-0
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.320
Hose being.

056e089a-26f5-4341-9a0a-b0b64b63f770-0
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:19.470
There's some crazy activity
going on. I didn't see it first.

32ffb022-63aa-4e59-ad77-d4392c78dc3e-0
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:23.790
And there's a fire engine coming
and spraying people.

cef32106-1175-4552-aa27-00025378aac9-0
01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.160
I can't even imagine why.

44fe4283-65c6-45e6-9477-797dae338f7a-0
01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.570
Unless this is smoke in the
foreground, I guess there is.

a62371f5-b7dc-4ac7-b4b7-a084042d9026-0
01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.575
Yeah, the baggage handlers are
all gathered in front right

a62371f5-b7dc-4ac7-b4b7-a084042d9026-1
01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:41.290
here, and they're smoking while
they.

0be71809-0cba-4d5b-b45c-3014a8ed7fb1-0
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.910
They're on their break and
maybe.

c0fc329c-d569-4cee-95d6-999a3e82032c-0
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:48.500
That's why the fire truck's been
called.

23529b08-8b68-4b14-96e9-10f7075476e1-0
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.660
Hard to tell because it's.

c8248613-9feb-421a-8aa2-bd8004fa318e-0
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:54.250
A little bit fuzzy.

d9f5fa2f-30a7-4fee-a9d7-e9832a21cde8-0
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.960
The police are busy over here
too.

c3433d0a-1801-487a-a87a-a968328e500d-0
01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.450
Someone's fallen out of one
plane. Oh good Lord.

fb9daaee-b485-44a3-8a82-0281cc42d627-0
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.842
There is a fair amount of chaos.
Oh yeah, good Lord. People get

fb9daaee-b485-44a3-8a82-0281cc42d627-1
01:18:05.842 --> 01:18:08.380
run over by the bus or knocked
over by the bus.

05724e93-4454-47df-a109-4001d0673235-0
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:14.242
There's a biplane to the right
of the bus, right out of the

05724e93-4454-47df-a109-4001d0673235-1
01:18:14.242 --> 01:18:18.182
First World War. Or they are the
Wright brothers, or villain,

05724e93-4454-47df-a109-4001d0673235-2
01:18:18.182 --> 01:18:21.360
what's his name, Wright...? And
it's showing the.

a36922b2-f4c2-44c0-97ec-cef09597f197-0
01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.730
Ace of Spades on it. I have no
idea why.

d0af293d-c136-4ea9-8ec4-ed41867b941c-0
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.220
Yeah, there's a lot of chaos
here. #END_airport

0e508c82-8ff9-4de3-a671-ac349487f13b-0
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.430
You also haven't seen Waldo yet.

ee84a7d8-e6c6-4c91-990f-0b148edca3fe-0
01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.480
Perfect.

b8485501-c415-4c80-9027-7a33b8608850-0
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.480
See what I have next?

b9e7dc9c-31ab-4a10-9a8c-79045460dce4-0
01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:54.670
OK, next I have another complex
scene.

bfa6f784-2d74-4808-b4c8-73d2e5723772-0
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.310
OK.

a4388dff-0019-499b-a03d-f9d965214ce8-0
01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.037
When you're ready. Ohh yeah
there you go. When you're ready,

a4388dff-0019-499b-a03d-f9d965214ce8-1
01:19:17.037 --> 01:19:18.270
describe this scene.

f1a139c9-3116-4e71-bb9b-129bdb3d0ca8-0
01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.580
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
It says dinosaurs, spacemen, and

f1a139c9-3116-4e71-bb9b-129bdb3d0ca8-1
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:21.830
ghouls.

ef51ddee-4288-45a2-b1fd-12399527bace-0
01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:24.580
Wow, what a combination.

6ad7d9b9-d401-4370-aefa-d1a5a0285274-0
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.750
So.

ea2292ec-1bd4-4a21-9e5d-39bb15bb8c5c-0
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:33.177
Dinosaurs, spacemen, and ah!
There are the dinosaurs. So

ea2292ec-1bd4-4a21-9e5d-39bb15bb8c5c-1
01:19:33.177 --> 01:19:38.689
they're in the upper left hand
area and they're on the planet

ea2292ec-1bd4-4a21-9e5d-39bb15bb8c5c-2
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:42.690
when it was still very
primitive. Beautiful,

fc095442-7dc6-492d-b975-3165cf15d7f7-0
01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:48.257
You know, like early Earth is
what I'm guessing that this is

fc095442-7dc6-492d-b975-3165cf15d7f7-1
01:19:48.257 --> 01:19:52.710
taking place on Earth and there
are dinosaurs of all types.

51ae9253-f3d2-4307-beed-f723b20e3bd6-0
01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:57.298
I don't know dinosaur names
because girls didn't tend to

51ae9253-f3d2-4307-beed-f723b20e3bd6-1
01:19:57.298 --> 01:20:01.039
remember their names. Boys were
really into dinosaurs growing

51ae9253-f3d2-4307-beed-f723b20e3bd6-2
01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:01.220
up.

e51589c8-c3c4-44b5-bace-b7f63ceff2ed-0
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:05.964
I know brontosaurus and
stegosaurus, and that's about

e51589c8-c3c4-44b5-bace-b7f63ceff2ed-1
01:20:05.964 --> 01:20:10.318
it, but it looks like there's
one of almost every kind of

e51589c8-c3c4-44b5-bace-b7f63ceff2ed-2
01:20:10.318 --> 01:20:11.370
dinosaur here.

320014e6-3a2f-472c-a778-a1994b9540ca-0
01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:12.970
And then some.

20cee51d-227d-47b7-9e84-b3d16eeb1bb3-0
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.090
Group of of Green Gumby
characters.

7bdd6137-b2bb-4488-819a-0a1d420b2801-0
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:22.444
And the cavemen. The cavemen who
would have been living at the

7bdd6137-b2bb-4488-819a-0a1d420b2801-1
01:20:22.444 --> 01:20:25.750
same time as the dinosaurs, all
in that upper left area.

df078e67-27a9-4d3a-9b80-08c9982221d9-0
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:30.735
Looks like a couple of Cavemen

df078e67-27a9-4d3a-9b80-08c9982221d9-1
01:20:30.735 --> 01:20:31.250
volcano.

8445a1ac-1d94-4c7d-b866-9350cfe206f0-0
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.650
So it's dinosaur, spaceman and
then if you travel.

cdb0948e-0aa8-4229-9c07-920428eba9dd-0
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:43.813
Right from the dinosaur Caveman
area. That's where this spacemen

cdb0948e-0aa8-4229-9c07-920428eba9dd-1
01:20:43.813 --> 01:20:48.080
and the flying saucers are all
concentrated.

d7083b25-95aa-4f84-ab59-16d52d79b8cd-0
01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.398
There are a lot of spacemen who
are orbiting or traveling space

d7083b25-95aa-4f84-ab59-16d52d79b8cd-1
01:20:54.398 --> 01:20:58.840
on their own without a without
any kind of a space capsule,

d7083b25-95aa-4f84-ab59-16d52d79b8cd-2
01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.210
which is kind of risky business.

8a793396-b0ad-40ea-bfe7-824b3ee535a9-0
01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:07.992
And oh, they're being suspended.
So this is more of a play. Those

8a793396-b0ad-40ea-bfe7-824b3ee535a9-1
01:21:07.992 --> 01:21:12.780
spacemen and space women are
being suspended from the

8a793396-b0ad-40ea-bfe7-824b3ee535a9-2
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:18.278
scaffolding behind the scenes.
So basically this is a play of

8a793396-b0ad-40ea-bfe7-824b3ee535a9-3
01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:20.850
dinosaur spacemen and ghouls.

5e5810a4-1977-4f4e-bfcc-0a2d18b32c99-0
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.550
Interestingly.

294363ea-2f0a-4559-aefe-02085c31221d-0
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:28.510
I don't see a separate ghoul.

b9eff1e3-c587-4e81-a838-a2c125f0aeab-0
01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.484
Stage setting. They're kind of
interspersed here and there.

b9eff1e3-c587-4e81-a838-a2c125f0aeab-1
01:21:35.484 --> 01:21:40.449
They're green ghouls, blue three
or four of them, beneath the

b9eff1e3-c587-4e81-a838-a2c125f0aeab-2
01:21:40.449 --> 01:21:41.250
dinosaurs.

8b9e6292-c9b9-4933-9346-b3cb44887120-0
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.790
And there are.

4f1ac527-a786-49a0-ac6e-1d38db0d92bf-0
01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.569
I saw the ghouls somewhere. Darn
it, yeah, there are some green,

4f1ac527-a786-49a0-ac6e-1d38db0d92bf-1
01:21:52.569 --> 01:21:55.230
some more green ghouls in the
lower center.

ae90010b-6242-4e7c-8c96-2edc7c26e792-0
01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:00.512
In the area of the Dairy Queen
ice cream cone, there's a tree

ae90010b-6242-4e7c-8c96-2edc7c26e792-1
01:22:00.512 --> 01:22:00.940
ghoul.

69f23d74-a330-4cbf-a65e-7df69b441a5f-0
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:05.541
Near there too, there's some
very big lights, so it looks as

69f23d74-a330-4cbf-a65e-7df69b441a5f-1
01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:05.940
though.

ed7cdf5d-f784-4825-967e-7c4b8bed3584-0
01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:08.840
They've got

cf84d631-88d3-49cb-90d6-a5cb35a01f9f-0
01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.530
Movie being made in the lower
center.

c52cbe48-e5f4-49d5-ba0f-ba7d492ff62b-0
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:21.000
Ghost movie The Ghouls are in
there.

da027c84-5826-4e02-bf54-405198dd9842-0
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.800
And they have this
cinematography.

df064c3b-8f03-4c3d-b223-9b1d6f2e2497-0
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:25.340
Lights.

de67c974-b203-419a-8cc8-4e90acb27e5d-0
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.206
Lighting the whole action
sequences there. And Oh yeah,

de67c974-b203-419a-8cc8-4e90acb27e5d-1
01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:32.660
there's more ghouls, there's
some.

f6c361d8-4553-4536-a779-c576854bfac0-0
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:38.080
Men wrapped up in bandages. That
kind of a ghoul classic.

bd75dd15-16ad-4050-a4b2-cb29d78361e8-0
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.278
And as usual, it's just
chockablock so stuffed with

bd75dd15-16ad-4050-a4b2-cb29d78361e8-1
01:22:43.278 --> 01:22:46.532
people. I don't know how
anybody's making sense of

bd75dd15-16ad-4050-a4b2-cb29d78361e8-2
01:22:46.532 --> 01:22:50.425
things, but Oh yeah, there are
lights suspended all over. So

bd75dd15-16ad-4050-a4b2-cb29d78361e8-3
01:22:50.425 --> 01:22:54.508
this is a movie set and a movie,
apparently. I haven't read the

bd75dd15-16ad-4050-a4b2-cb29d78361e8-4
01:22:54.508 --> 01:22:58.337
description, but it looks as
though there was a movie being

bd75dd15-16ad-4050-a4b2-cb29d78361e8-5
01:22:58.337 --> 01:23:00.889
made. Oh, and there's the time
clicker.

e53261c1-deb4-4d6b-9e82-1aa627f1b403-0
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:06.963
The cut action kind of thing
here. So it's a movie being made

e53261c1-deb4-4d6b-9e82-1aa627f1b403-1
01:23:06.963 --> 01:23:09.080
about dinosaurs, spacemen and
ghouls.

dd7d44d1-acbb-44f9-af83-6d1a07fb7ab7-0
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.680
OK.

9610deed-967f-4bdd-8df9-3ae39c966cfe-0
01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:16.450

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:24.750
The next one is another complex
scene.

e420394f-a5d5-40fb-b1cf-47fc8e9de483-0
01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.240

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:55.380
OK, same thing as before. It's a
complex scene. Yep.

9a3d602d-eb43-4f5c-b51f-8d8976b20689-0
01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:57.320
OK.

2a14c76d-e0b0-4a83-97ea-86c9721f90ef-0
01:23:58.030 --> 01:24:02.415
#START_being_a_pirate All right.
This is a great one. It's

2a14c76d-e0b0-4a83-97ea-86c9721f90ef-1
01:24:02.415 --> 01:24:07.247

if I told you, Megan, but I live

01:24:07.247 --> 01:24:11.410
right near Casco Bay and
Portland. ME. OK, so this kind

2a14c76d-e0b0-4a83-97ea-86c9721f90ef-3
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:16.019

half a mile from here in the

01:24:16.019 --> 01:24:20.776
back in the 1600s and 1700s, for
sure, I say.} And there's just

01:24:20.776 --> 01:24:24.864
it almost looks like Johnny

01:24:24.864 --> 01:24:25.980
Caribbean here.

c0e96b28-cff7-4960-b2fc-088a07bba1be-0
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.790
It's a pirate

ea18b650-5233-4f90-ad67-659ade26ac33-0
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:33.882
Pirate Mania, one very big ship
and then smaller ships and

ea18b650-5233-4f90-ad67-659ade26ac33-1
01:24:33.882 --> 01:24:37.973
they're there, those beautiful
old sailing ships. And they're

ea18b650-5233-4f90-ad67-659ade26ac33-2
01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:42.064
not underway right now because
their sails are all wrapped up

ea18b650-5233-4f90-ad67-659ade26ac33-3
01:24:42.064 --> 01:24:42.789
and stowed.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.170
And well.

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.794
Looks as though there's, yep,
there's some pirate warfare

f3675f3d-ad7d-44c7-858f-64d3fcce1d4b-1
01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:53.524
going on. There are smaller
boats trying to invade the

f3675f3d-ad7d-44c7-858f-64d3fcce1d4b-2
01:24:53.524 --> 01:24:56.169
larger boat, and they're firing
on it.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.759
To try to subdue everyone on
there. There are sailors,

e689e813-67c9-4310-8d64-b51f372d0e75-1
01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:06.350
whether they're pirates or or
not. There's sailors and all

e689e813-67c9-4310-8d64-b51f372d0e75-2
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:09.230
levels of the boat, right up to
the.

01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:13.220
The what do they call those
things up there in the?

6d26b191-108b-4aac-8bbc-ffdbdfbae2b7-0
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:19.223
I forget. Up there in the
rafters there's lots of small

6d26b191-108b-4aac-8bbc-ffdbdfbae2b7-1
01:25:19.223 --> 01:25:23.060
row boats full of pirates off to
do no good.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.923
I can see an octopus getting in
on the action and then on the

Many pa palm trees, so palm
trees showing up again. I've

01:25:35.373 --> 01:25:37.480

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.910
A lot of telescopes, those
single telescopes.

da58b0ba-e847-4c99-acc1-1ad9fd77d33b-0
01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.330

01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:59.650
Pirate flags hither and sither.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:01.380
I'm not seeing any.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:03.310
Pirate.

01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:09.041
Treasure. You know how they're
always after treasure? Not

a5d352cd-e081-499d-baeb-2e6a40670194-1
01:26:09.041 --> 01:26:12.411
seeing any treasure chests
anywhere, so they're they're

01:26:12.411 --> 01:26:16.203
probably stashed in that larger
boat and that's why there's so

a5d352cd-e081-499d-baeb-2e6a40670194-3
01:26:16.203 --> 01:26:19.995
much activity around it. They're
trying to get to the treasure

a5d352cd-e081-499d-baeb-2e6a40670194-4
01:26:19.995 --> 01:26:23.787
chest and take them ashore, fill
them from themselves, what it

a5d352cd-e081-499d-baeb-2e6a40670194-5
01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:24.449
looks like.
