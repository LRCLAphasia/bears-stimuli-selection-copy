b3774362-ac58-4368-be7d-8919e30ebdd7-0
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.887
All right. So like last week
you're going to see a complex

b3774362-ac58-4368-be7d-8919e30ebdd7-1
00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:11.572
scene and I want you to describe
what you see in the scene and

b3774362-ac58-4368-be7d-8919e30ebdd7-2
00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:16.257
take about 3 to 5 minutes to do
so. And I'll have a timer just

b3774362-ac58-4368-be7d-8919e30ebdd7-3
00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:21.016
to keep track of time and I will
share my screen now and I will

b3774362-ac58-4368-be7d-8919e30ebdd7-4
00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:21.760
make this.

04153abf-23cc-4623-b6e3-9e89b0564d74-0
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.194
Bigger. And again, you want like
3 to 5 minutes. Yeah. And you

04153abf-23cc-4623-b6e3-9e89b0564d74-1
00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:32.533
could start when you're ready.
OK, sounds good.

04153abf-23cc-4623-b6e3-9e89b0564d74-2
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:37.957
#START_deep_sea_divers All
right. So generally this is a an

04153abf-23cc-4623-b6e3-9e89b0564d74-3
00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:43.381
underwater scene with a lot of
activities involving Fisher,

04153abf-23cc-4623-b6e3-9e89b0564d74-4
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.805
like fishermen, mermaids and
other underwater creatures and

04153abf-23cc-4623-b6e3-9e89b0564d74-5
00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:49.890
marine life.

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-0
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.581
So the the scene is divided kind
of into thirds, the top third is

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-1
00:00:55.581 --> 00:01:00.019
all above the water, and the
lower 2/3 are scenes on what's

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-2
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.679
happening underwater. There's a
caption in the upper left hand

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-3
00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.191
corner that reads the deep sea
divers. The the text there. I

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-4
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:13.777
can kind of read it, but it's
blurry because of what's on the

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-5
00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:18.585
screen right now. So I'll start
with the top third of everything

4007a546-dc64-49ca-b2a7-e3514e320bdd-6
00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:21.470
that's happening above the water
line.

1be804d1-9eb0-4c4d-8a5d-999bb0c34e76-0
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.274
So there's probably about 10 to
a dozen boats, very small

1be804d1-9eb0-4c4d-8a5d-999bb0c34e76-1
00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:31.384
dinghies, on which people are
doing mostly fishing activities.

1be804d1-9eb0-4c4d-8a5d-999bb0c34e76-2
00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:35.844
So some of them are holding
fishing poles and actively

1be804d1-9eb0-4c4d-8a5d-999bb0c34e76-3
00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:40.792
fishing. Some of them are, you
know, kind of talking to each

1be804d1-9eb0-4c4d-8a5d-999bb0c34e76-4
00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:45.983
other. At least one person has a
big fishing net. More than one

1be804d1-9eb0-4c4d-8a5d-999bb0c34e76-5
00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:47.930
person has fishing Nets.

cc3615a3-21f6-4f48-8411-f227f3ec3453-0
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.970
Also in the background there are
large like kind of rock

cc3615a3-21f6-4f48-8411-f227f3ec3453-1
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.065
structures jutting out from
under the from the sea floor up

cc3615a3-21f6-4f48-8411-f227f3ec3453-2
00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:04.499
through the the surface of the
water. And on those rocky areas,

cc3615a3-21f6-4f48-8411-f227f3ec3453-3
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:09.510
we've got additional fishermen.
One rock is just mermaids.

27ab8e62-6f85-4a2c-9deb-9b1b7fc324b5-0
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.190
And.

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-0
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.662
We've got people swimming in the
water and and just kind of like

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-1
00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:21.764
generally there's a lot of
activity happening above the

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-2
00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:26.234
surface, but then when we look
at the lower 2/3 there's even

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-3
00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:30.263
more stuff going on. You can
barely see the blue water

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-4
00:02:30.263 --> 00:02:34.659
background because of how much
of the scene is comprised of

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-5
00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.542
just you know people and
mermaids and fish and other

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-6
00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:42.938
marine creatures. So in this
scene I would say that there's

56d6227b-8ed1-4050-81c8-d87c3bd2151b-7
00:02:42.938 --> 00:02:44.550
probably at least 100.

f2b2b540-6249-44a5-a4df-58f9a81b1422-0
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.270
If not like 200

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-0
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.037
Different people, and a lot of
them are fishermen. They're

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-1
00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:55.044
wearing like striped swim
trunks, doing lots of activities

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-2
00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:59.391
with fishing Nets. They're down
there actively swimming around,

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-3
00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:03.330
I guess trying to catch fish.
There's probably at least a

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-4
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.406
dozen, if not more, mermaids.
They all look pretty much the

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-5
00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:10.938
same with green tails. And
they're all white women.

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-6
00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:15.352
Everyone here is white. There's
no diversity at all, but they're

afb3fd15-301b-4444-a480-e7e9b1272726-7
00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:16.100
all blonde.

9c899802-d5b9-4262-b6a9-87a9546e1073-0
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.950
The the marine creatures are
mostly fish, so we've got just

9c899802-d5b9-4262-b6a9-87a9546e1073-1
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.887
hundreds of fish around. But
then there's other creatures,

9c899802-d5b9-4262-b6a9-87a9546e1073-2
00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:32.154
like even larger fish, or
there's like a Marlin or

9c899802-d5b9-4262-b6a9-87a9546e1073-3
00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:37.091
swordfish, an octopus down the
bottom. And then at the sea

9c899802-d5b9-4262-b6a9-87a9546e1073-4
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:42.278
floor we see like a coral and a
big clamshell. There's like a

9c899802-d5b9-4262-b6a9-87a9546e1073-5
00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:46.630
treasure chest down there and
just other creatures.

6bb41275-84d2-456c-8a08-eaf4919e6531-0
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.648
So yeah, lots of activities,
lots of crazy things happening

6bb41275-84d2-456c-8a08-eaf4919e6531-1
00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.890
that don't make any sense. Like
there's a cane, just kind of

6bb41275-84d2-456c-8a08-eaf4919e6531-2
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.131
like floating in the water. But
yeah, so the scene itself is

6bb41275-84d2-456c-8a08-eaf4919e6531-3
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.470
just underwater chaos.

aaa847d0-531c-4fd2-8e7e-f60cce7ae7f6-0
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.356
All right, I'm going to pull up
the next one and I'm going to

aaa847d0-531c-4fd2-8e7e-f60cce7ae7f6-1
00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:09.110
stop the timer.

83357255-897d-4dd6-b05e-ce4b093011e5-0
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.810
OK.

d568a10b-1b83-427e-a566-9be7acd219e0-0
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.810
So next we have.

5d001a0c-e92d-4022-a7b4-32efadcc900f-0
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.720
Another complex scene.

601b0b23-dcab-4e97-9df8-d13adf1ee391-0
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.330
I'm going to share my screen
again.

05de55d0-b14c-4c2a-bc81-6fc3ad0689b1-0
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.235
And I'd like you to do the same
thing. It's a complex scene, so

05de55d0-b14c-4c2a-bc81-6fc3ad0689b1-1
00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.580
three to five minutes to
describe what you see.

b1774776-a8b1-417d-a46b-535700721cbe-0
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.440
#START_ancient_rome OK, so here
we have a sort of gladiatorial

b1774776-a8b1-417d-a46b-535700721cbe-1
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.560
circus from.

c27875bf-45db-44dd-b8e2-6aceb3ba593a-0
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.148
What looks like ancient Roman
times. There is a caption in the

c27875bf-45db-44dd-b8e2-6aceb3ba593a-1
00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:03.010
upper left that says fun and
games in ancient Rome.

ba0cde5c-b3f7-4b7c-8c05-c2e6625726bc-0
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.950
written sort of like to look as
if it was on a tablet.

0afb9282-cade-4c55-9484-202be9f65d28-0
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.668
The scene is the interior of
like the circus, like the Circus

0afb9282-cade-4c55-9484-202be9f65d28-1
00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:16.430
Maximus.

3b6c920a-8134-475c-b0e5-6611751bf31c-0
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.601
And surrounding the the arena
itself, we see bleachers of some

3b6c920a-8134-475c-b0e5-6611751bf31c-1
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:30.650
people, you know, looking down
at the scene below.

ee8dadb0-f68a-461a-ae6a-8cd8c231e5e4-0
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.603
And what is happening on the
scene below is all sorts of

ee8dadb0-f68a-461a-ae6a-8cd8c231e5e4-1
00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:39.971
different fights that are
happening. And I would say that

ee8dadb0-f68a-461a-ae6a-8cd8c231e5e4-2
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:44.189
there's probably close to about
like 80 to 100 of these

ee8dadb0-f68a-461a-ae6a-8cd8c231e5e4-3
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.859
different individual battles or
fights going on. Primarily we

ee8dadb0-f68a-461a-ae6a-8cd8c231e5e4-4
00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:51.420
see people fighting other
people.

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-0
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.671
There are some of these men in
uniforms, like they're wearing

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-1
00:05:56.671 --> 00:06:00.208
helmets and they're holding
Shields and it looks like

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-2
00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:04.334
they're wearing armor. But then
some of these other people are

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-3
00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:08.330
wearing barely anything at all.
Like maybe they're barefoot.

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-4
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.391
They're, they're just wearing
like a loincloth, but otherwise

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-5
00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:16.518
they're not clothed. So I think
that it's indicating that, you

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-6
00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:20.644
know, some of these people are
gladiators and some of them may

1522d4a3-6600-4e03-b28a-3190b75f2a04-7
00:06:20.644 --> 00:06:22.610
have just been dragged in off.

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-0
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.963
Street, like maybe slaves or,
you know, prisoners of war that

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-1
00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:31.100
were thrown in there, you know,
like they were just unlucky

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-2
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.511
enough to be thrown in with the
gladiators. There's a couple of

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-3
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:39.992
Chariots, these sort of Chariots
that are being drawn by horses.

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-4
00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:44.059
But because these scenes are
chaotic, there's a couple of,

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-5
00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.264
like, silly things happening.
Like one of the Chariots has a

6659f38a-8973-4b92-9c42-00db9756327f-6
00:06:48.264 --> 00:06:52.470
horse riding the chariot and
it's being pulled by four guys.

af77c9a0-bbb4-41ad-bed4-a18b979fa3ad-0
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.044
Instead of what should be the
other way around, there are a

af77c9a0-bbb4-41ad-bed4-a18b979fa3ad-1
00:06:57.044 --> 00:07:01.316
number of lions also in the
circus. So there's a couple of

af77c9a0-bbb4-41ad-bed4-a18b979fa3ad-2
00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:06.096
scenes where people are fighting
the lions. In some cases they're

af77c9a0-bbb4-41ad-bed4-a18b979fa3ad-3
00:07:06.096 --> 00:07:10.513
people are winning. In most
cases, the Lions are winning. In

af77c9a0-bbb4-41ad-bed4-a18b979fa3ad-4
00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.712
one scene, a lion is sitting
down to dinner with a dinner

af77c9a0-bbb4-41ad-bed4-a18b979fa3ad-5
00:07:14.712 --> 00:07:19.130
napkin tied around its neck and
holding up a knife and fork.

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-0
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.680
While a person sits in like a
dinner plate or a dinner pot

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-1
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.298
nearby towards the back of the
arena, several lions have

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-2
00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:34.241
created a lion pyramid and are
trying to escape the arena by

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-3
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:39.507
climbing up into the stands. And
it looks like they're they have

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-4
00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:44.693
seen some success in doing that.
In the upper right hand corner

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-5
00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:49.068
you see an emperor figure
surrounded by centurions or

c2b25331-bd9f-427d-971a-8f571dc18fb1-6
00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:49.960
gladiators.

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-0
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.353
And that person is looking on,
though the picture is a little

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-1
00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:58.249
blurry and I can't really tell,
you know, like what their

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-2
00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:01.875
reaction is to to watching
everything take place. But

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-3
00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:06.174
that's the scene. So we've got
lots of lots of fights going on.

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-4
00:08:06.174 --> 00:08:10.338
Oh, there's some. There's some
cheetahs, I guess as well. So,

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-5
00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:14.501
Yep, there's animals, humans
fighting each other, and a large

87b5cdbb-9d62-42d6-93d9-79f3576630e4-6
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:17.859
group of spectators looking on.

e3f28c5f-a5bf-4118-8d8d-59d768573093-0
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.080
OK, perfect. I'll quote the next
one.

9e2b7e3d-fdc6-43ad-96b9-b476a9455bc4-0
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.200
OK, next one. We have a short
story, so like last week.

51ede76d-0205-4b58-8a5f-84abde74d0af-0
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.225
Describe what you see in each
scene and then as you go through

51ede76d-0205-4b58-8a5f-84abde74d0af-1
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.061
them, tell me when you would
like me to flip through the

51ede76d-0205-4b58-8a5f-84abde74d0af-2
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:40.410
slides.

f93bd4e9-7247-4ba4-9187-8ad209bbbe71-0
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.600
Sure.

e8124cdc-a368-43f7-a51e-28a009febe50-0
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.560
And this story is approximately
4 page, 4 slides long.

55ef674d-e8f7-4a6e-97ca-b7ee57010547-0
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.280
OK. And I will.

94d53a57-bdf8-4cb7-815a-c31bb5ec3e30-0
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.999
Put it in presenting mode. OK.
OK. So you should begin when

94d53a57-bdf8-4cb7-815a-c31bb5ec3e30-1
00:08:55.999 --> 00:09:00.320
you're ready. Yep. OK. All
right. Ready. #START_arrival_5

94d53a57-bdf8-4cb7-815a-c31bb5ec3e30-2
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.120
So this story is primarily told
in black and white

94d53a57-bdf8-4cb7-815a-c31bb5ec3e30-3
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.739
illustrations, except it's done
in a kind of a sepia tone. In

94d53a57-bdf8-4cb7-815a-c31bb5ec3e30-4
00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:13.507
the first scene we see a city,
you know, part of a city. That's

94d53a57-bdf8-4cb7-815a-c31bb5ec3e30-5
00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:14.549
part, I guess.

038626d1-8790-4cf0-bb47-4dfe8d6d0d5e-0
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.912
Where it, where it meets its
harbor. So we see a boat launch

038626d1-8790-4cf0-bb47-4dfe8d6d0d5e-1
00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:25.894
kind of jutting into the harbor
and a rowboat kind of either,

038626d1-8790-4cf0-bb47-4dfe8d6d0d5e-2
00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:30.635
you know, coming into the boat
launch or maybe just having

038626d1-8790-4cf0-bb47-4dfe8d6d0d5e-3
00:09:30.635 --> 00:09:35.778
launched a couple of empty row
boats or dinghies that have been

038626d1-8790-4cf0-bb47-4dfe8d6d0d5e-4
00:09:35.778 --> 00:09:38.270
stored up on the launch itself,

a8b4d748-541c-4ccf-b10c-447a2d544a5c-0
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.906
you know, lying in wait. The
city is comprised of what looks

a8b4d748-541c-4ccf-b10c-447a2d544a5c-1
00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:50.144
like a lot of townhouses or
apartment buildings that are

a8b4d748-541c-4ccf-b10c-447a2d544a5c-2
00:09:50.144 --> 00:09:55.566
very close into each other. It's
a fantasy kind of a world

a8b4d748-541c-4ccf-b10c-447a2d544a5c-3
00:09:55.566 --> 00:10:00.345
because coming up from these
buildings are enormous

a8b4d748-541c-4ccf-b10c-447a2d544a5c-4
00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:05.951
structures or statues of what
look like owls. So I mean like

a8b4d748-541c-4ccf-b10c-447a2d544a5c-5
00:10:05.951 --> 00:10:09.260
if a building is about 123456 or
7.

1486c813-33e5-4f95-92d7-271cb5b6bf86-0
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.039
Stories tall. That's how tall
these owl structures are. Again.

1486c813-33e5-4f95-92d7-271cb5b6bf86-1
00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.460
So like 14 stories.

b6174b56-f8fe-46de-8a8d-330719994d0f-0
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.855
Above sea level is the tallest
of these owls, so there's one

b6174b56-f8fe-46de-8a8d-330719994d0f-1
00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:26.841
giant owl in the center, and
it's surrounded by slightly

b6174b56-f8fe-46de-8a8d-330719994d0f-2
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:32.351
smaller but still gigantic owls.
And there are birds flying in

b6174b56-f8fe-46de-8a8d-330719994d0f-3
00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:37.249
the sky all over the place, so
several flocks of birds.

17456c40-084d-4010-ba87-e66b0c2402ea-0
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.310
Flying in and perching on the
tops of these large owl statues.

01895754-e1fb-4577-b555-d41b58d6f543-0
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.936
In the next scene, it's a it's
just, it's a series of very

01895754-e1fb-4577-b555-d41b58d6f543-1
00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:55.288
small illustrations. The first
one we see some hands tying a

01895754-e1fb-4577-b555-d41b58d6f543-2
00:10:55.288 --> 00:11:00.552
rope around a very small cat
statue. Then we see a man with

01895754-e1fb-4577-b555-d41b58d6f543-3
00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:05.641
suspenders gesturing towards
something in the background,

01895754-e1fb-4577-b555-d41b58d6f543-4
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:11.256
while a man wearing a suit and
hat stands in the foreground but

01895754-e1fb-4577-b555-d41b58d6f543-5
00:11:11.256 --> 00:11:14.590
facing away from us. So he's
looking.

003eab37-4396-4729-9289-3ce1475ccf1e-0
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.170
at where the man with suspenders
is gesturing.

7ab9de47-df04-4ddf-bf20-475bbc638fab-0
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.616
In the next scene we see a small
boy carrying something in his

7ab9de47-df04-4ddf-bf20-475bbc638fab-1
00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:26.836
arms and he's being followed on
either side by two fantasy

7ab9de47-df04-4ddf-bf20-475bbc638fab-2
00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:31.485
creatures. One is like the snake
mouse creature and another kind

7ab9de47-df04-4ddf-bf20-475bbc638fab-3
00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:31.699
of.

f5fbfb6c-16c8-4182-8fb2-cd56145c622d-0
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.480
Cat dragon creature.

5e365b99-2aef-47d8-86e2-3cae07585b29-0
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.752
And in the next scene, the boy
is handing what was in his arms,

5e365b99-2aef-47d8-86e2-3cae07585b29-1
00:11:39.752 --> 00:11:43.570
which is kind of a basket full
of food, it looks like, to a

5e365b99-2aef-47d8-86e2-3cae07585b29-2
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.642
woman who's reaching down, and
she appears to be very grateful.

5e365b99-2aef-47d8-86e2-3cae07585b29-3
00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:48.469
They're both.

72bc55d4-7cd5-43e5-b32a-cb35293a7272-0
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.382
Well, she's smiling. It's hard
to know what the boy is doing,

72bc55d4-7cd5-43e5-b32a-cb35293a7272-1
00:11:52.382 --> 00:11:55.250
but I think that this is like an
affectionate gesture.

6482ce07-00e7-4057-aa65-524cdd83ef73-0
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.759
And then we see the next scene
where the man with suspenders is

6482ce07-00e7-4057-aa65-524cdd83ef73-1
00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:03.289
coming in, and he himself is
also holding a basket of what

6482ce07-00e7-4057-aa65-524cdd83ef73-2
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.759
looks like food, and he's
reaching in for an affectionate

6482ce07-00e7-4057-aa65-524cdd83ef73-3
00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:10.529
kiss to the woman. And she has
his her arm around his neck, so

6482ce07-00e7-4057-aa65-524cdd83ef73-4
00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:13.940
she's pulling him in for a hug
and they kiss each other.

e62ea1df-a8b0-4428-ba73-5494de026bfb-0
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.319
Then we see the man who had been
wearing the suit and hat, except

e62ea1df-a8b0-4428-ba73-5494de026bfb-1
00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:23.393
now he's holding the hat in his
hand as he's being welcomed by

e62ea1df-a8b0-4428-ba73-5494de026bfb-2
00:12:23.393 --> 00:12:26.240
the man with suspenders and the
woman. She,

025da495-0e05-4c63-8db2-fcb0bddda195-0
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.595
The man with the hat and the
woman are are shaking hands and

025da495-0e05-4c63-8db2-fcb0bddda195-1
00:12:31.595 --> 00:12:35.828
everyone seems delighted, so
they're welcoming him. And in

025da495-0e05-4c63-8db2-fcb0bddda195-2
00:12:35.828 --> 00:12:40.132
the next scene she is gesturing
with her arms to, you know,

025da495-0e05-4c63-8db2-fcb0bddda195-3
00:12:40.132 --> 00:12:42.929
please come inside. In the next
scene,

0d74860c-0d6b-4402-aa86-c695ffb16330-0
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.283
We see four hands each holding
drinks. The four the three adult

0d74860c-0d6b-4402-aa86-c695ffb16330-1
00:12:49.283 --> 00:12:54.033
hands are holding squat like
highball glasses and the smaller

0d74860c-0d6b-4402-aa86-c695ffb16330-2
00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:58.860
hand from down below is holding
like a water glass. So I think

0d74860c-0d6b-4402-aa86-c695ffb16330-3
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.840
that the child is not allowed to
be drinking what the adults are

0d74860c-0d6b-4402-aa86-c695ffb16330-4
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.530
drinking.

9c75f595-6fd9-4a3b-a8b6-8f7121e15925-0
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.550
And the next scene we see, I
think probably the woman's hands

9c75f595-6fd9-4a3b-a8b6-8f7121e15925-1
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.188
going through the baskets of
food and pulling out some

9c75f595-6fd9-4a3b-a8b6-8f7121e15925-2
00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:17.488
creatures that they'll likely be
eating. The scene after that is

9c75f595-6fd9-4a3b-a8b6-8f7121e15925-3
00:13:17.488 --> 00:13:21.192
cutting. She's using a knife to
to slice the one of the

9c75f595-6fd9-4a3b-a8b6-8f7121e15925-4
00:13:21.192 --> 00:13:22.780
creatures or vegetables.

5fd3448f-e53a-4f6f-852e-209d949e9da7-0
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.430
It's hard to say into discs.

e909559b-4e31-47fd-b317-9e17c7d27b86-0
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.650
Or coins.

5e1eb291-03c8-43ff-a445-03cd7aca9057-0
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.874
In the next scene, she's she's
holding the top of what looks

5e1eb291-03c8-43ff-a445-03cd7aca9057-1
00:13:33.874 --> 00:13:38.148
like a teapot and twisting a
button on it or doing something

5e1eb291-03c8-43ff-a445-03cd7aca9057-2
00:13:38.148 --> 00:13:39.130
with this pot.

5ba7b7d9-12c8-49f6-addc-e9e94bee2257-0
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.070
You know, as part of the food
preparation, and in the last

5ba7b7d9-12c8-49f6-addc-e9e94bee2257-1
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.930
scene on this page, you know she
is.

6585fe25-113a-4f0f-8783-c0f0851b1790-0
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.134
Brushing on some kind of a
liquid onto the top of a

6585fe25-113a-4f0f-8783-c0f0851b1790-1
00:13:53.134 --> 00:13:57.813
presented food. So like there's
something that represents a

6585fe25-113a-4f0f-8783-c0f0851b1790-2
00:13:57.813 --> 00:14:02.570
Turkey, but obviously not a
Turkey on a platter. And she is.

a465836a-7ac3-44fe-8c65-bfd8b809d53b-0
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.800
She is brushing on, probably
some.

96073609-ec6e-4537-863e-364c4c2c4305-0
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.163
You know, like finishing element
to the top of this. Maybe maybe

96073609-ec6e-4537-863e-364c4c2c4305-1
00:14:11.163 --> 00:14:14.842
butter or maybe gravy. It's hard
to say. She's just holding a cup

96073609-ec6e-4537-863e-364c4c2c4305-2
00:14:14.842 --> 00:14:17.630
and and doing a brushing motion
on the top of it.

fd52a21c-a5a6-4f88-bc58-0b67ed8994cb-0
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.344
In the following scene of full
page scene we see the man with

fd52a21c-a5a6-4f88-bc58-0b67ed8994cb-1
00:14:27.344 --> 00:14:31.577
suspenders using a torch that
seems to have come out from

fd52a21c-a5a6-4f88-bc58-0b67ed8994cb-2
00:14:31.577 --> 00:14:36.394
under the table. So he's holding
the torch in one hand and it has

fd52a21c-a5a6-4f88-bc58-0b67ed8994cb-3
00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:40.992
a tube going under the table and
the other, and from the torch

fd52a21c-a5a6-4f88-bc58-0b67ed8994cb-4
00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:43.620
it's a large flame that he's
using.

60fcaae1-8d4d-4a4e-a01e-fc0e50382aab-0
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.001
to roast one of the creatures or
one of the vegetables that he's

60fcaae1-8d4d-4a4e-a01e-fc0e50382aab-1
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:53.151
holding with tongs with the
other hand. At the at the table,

60fcaae1-8d4d-4a4e-a01e-fc0e50382aab-2
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:57.505
the woman and the man with the
suit are leaning into each other

60fcaae1-8d4d-4a4e-a01e-fc0e50382aab-3
00:14:57.505 --> 00:15:01.723
and having a conversation. The
boy is more in the foreground,

60fcaae1-8d4d-4a4e-a01e-fc0e50382aab-4
00:15:01.723 --> 00:15:05.805
and we see him reaching down to
the floor and feeding table

60fcaae1-8d4d-4a4e-a01e-fc0e50382aab-5
00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:07.710
scraps to the two creatures.

dc26b67c-c7ff-44ce-81f7-3d42f28e2bc3-0
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.142
The following scenes are just
all what's happening at the

dc26b67c-c7ff-44ce-81f7-3d42f28e2bc3-1
00:15:13.142 --> 00:15:17.359
table. The first three are each
the suspenders, the woman, the

dc26b67c-c7ff-44ce-81f7-3d42f28e2bc3-2
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:21.442
man with the suit. We see them
each engaged in conversation,

dc26b67c-c7ff-44ce-81f7-3d42f28e2bc3-3
00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:25.793
smiling, having a good time. The
three scenes after that are all

dc26b67c-c7ff-44ce-81f7-3d42f28e2bc3-4
00:15:25.793 --> 00:15:29.810
music. So man with suspenders is
playing an accordion like.

864ce0d7-8a21-441b-be12-da3975d6d3cc-0
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.161
Instrument with three horns
coming out of it. The woman is

864ce0d7-8a21-441b-be12-da3975d6d3cc-1
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:36.750
playing some kind of a recorder
or piccolo.

63eb5a31-b4f6-4d9c-9f1b-bb3d1b5938d0-0
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.516
Style instrument. I mean, it
doesn't exist in real life,

63eb5a31-b4f6-4d9c-9f1b-bb3d1b5938d0-1
00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:41.860
it's.

34713e99-14d5-4adf-bbdd-839cd5d81618-0
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.707
It's an instrument that she's
blowing into and using her

34713e99-14d5-4adf-bbdd-839cd5d81618-1
00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:48.220
fingers to plug holes.

d8c78e6a-64eb-49d9-ba54-0880e3e35751-0
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.518
To produce the music. And then
the boy is also playing an

d8c78e6a-64eb-49d9-ba54-0880e3e35751-1
00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:59.466
instrument. It kind of looks
like a cross between a banjo and

d8c78e6a-64eb-49d9-ba54-0880e3e35751-2
00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:04.414
a mandolin. It's round like a
banjo, but it's open, more like

d8c78e6a-64eb-49d9-ba54-0880e3e35751-3
00:16:04.414 --> 00:16:06.249
a guitar or a mandolin.

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-0
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.300
And then in the following three
scenes, we see some paper

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-1
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.928
folding. So this is the man in
the suit. He's brought out some

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-2
00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:17.210
paper and he starts to make
folds in it. And then in the

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-3
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.839
next scene, he's holding up a
folded paper creature that looks

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-4
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:24.121
very much like the boy's
companion, like the kind of cat

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-5
00:16:24.121 --> 00:16:27.864
dragon creature. And then we see
the boy holding the cat, dragon

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-6
00:16:27.864 --> 00:16:31.550
creature and looking at it and
just delighted he's also wearing

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-7
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.660
the man's hat. So, I mean,
there's a lot of affection

843168f8-b22e-4c36-9e7f-ee7c5a32afd5-8
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.540
happening here that they're
sharing each other's.

d5a23bec-c932-4b19-92de-1700d714dad2-0
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.790
Special things with each other,
then the man with the suspenders

d5a23bec-c932-4b19-92de-1700d714dad2-1
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.390
in these last three scenes.

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-0
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.655
goes and pulls a pot out of one
of the cabinets in the home. And

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-1
00:16:49.655 --> 00:16:54.371
then the woman and the man both
together present the pot towards

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-2
00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:58.868
like I guess towards us as the
viewer, but presumably towards

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-3
00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:03.149
the man in the suit. They're
both holding it in both hands

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-4
00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:07.719
and and presenting it outwards,
holding it out from themselves

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-5
00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:12.217
and towards us or towards the
man in the hat. And then in the

543d3c20-6edb-4292-bec3-68182282497c-6
00:17:12.217 --> 00:17:16.280
final scene we see just an up
close picture of the man.

2b32bc94-3233-4d5b-bb93-984180afa35a-0
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:21.019
with the suspenders holding this
is pot and it does not look like

2b32bc94-3233-4d5b-bb93-984180afa35a-1
00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:25.264
a special pot. It just looks
like a normal kind of clay pot

2b32bc94-3233-4d5b-bb93-984180afa35a-2
00:17:25.264 --> 00:17:28.660
the size of, you know, two hands
held together.

b88faa4c-f894-4def-9d78-b188b0985e9d-0
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.997
And the next scene we see a
close up of the pot, it's just

b88faa4c-f894-4def-9d78-b188b0985e9d-1
00:17:37.997 --> 00:17:42.082
sitting on a table or a counter.
Then we get a sort of pulled

b88faa4c-f894-4def-9d78-b188b0985e9d-2
00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:46.300
away view and we see that the it
is a pot sitting on a counter.

c2a93bd4-dacf-4be9-b639-accd371cacdc-0
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.077
And then from there we pull out
even more and we see a mirror

c2a93bd4-dacf-4be9-b639-accd371cacdc-1
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:55.081
view or a through the window
view of the pot sitting on the

c2a93bd4-dacf-4be9-b639-accd371cacdc-2
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:58.951
counter. In the next three
scenes. In the next 6 scenes I

c2a93bd4-dacf-4be9-b639-accd371cacdc-3
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.289
would say we see the man waking
up. This would have been the man

c2a93bd4-dacf-4be9-b639-accd371cacdc-4
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:07.159
in the suit, but now he's not
wearing his suit, he's just

c2a93bd4-dacf-4be9-b639-accd371cacdc-5
00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:11.029
wearing a sort of an undershirt
and whatever he slept in.

fb5bbc04-5dd4-4db0-afe6-55a63eb2a6c1-0
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.001
And first we see him kind of
like under the covers, waking

fb5bbc04-5dd4-4db0-afe6-55a63eb2a6c1-1
00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:20.243
up, rubbing his eyes. And the
next scene he's sitting up a

fb5bbc04-5dd4-4db0-afe6-55a63eb2a6c1-2
00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:24.772
little bit more and his mouse
snake creature comes to to greet

fb5bbc04-5dd4-4db0-afe6-55a63eb2a6c1-3
00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:28.080
him and then he's he's petting
that creature.

4f458067-a1cd-48a4-aa75-b9ca2084c524-0
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.204
In the next few scenes, he's
getting ready. He's he's

4f458067-a1cd-48a4-aa75-b9ca2084c524-1
00:18:32.204 --> 00:18:35.756
buttoning up his shirt in the
first scene, and now he's

4f458067-a1cd-48a4-aa75-b9ca2084c524-2
00:18:35.756 --> 00:18:39.562
cutting up some kind of like
creature vegetable to have for

4f458067-a1cd-48a4-aa75-b9ca2084c524-3
00:18:39.562 --> 00:18:40.450
for breakfast.

2bed8fee-7c1a-4fdd-9bdf-500ce14a4590-0
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.018
In the next scene, he's reaching
down and feeding some of the

2bed8fee-7c1a-4fdd-9bdf-500ce14a4590-1
00:18:46.018 --> 00:18:50.040
scraps from his meal to his his
his pet companion.

2bf75a09-8ee8-49f5-a5fd-ca9d3181d764-0
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.060
Then we see him donning his
jacket. He's

86802137-212b-4776-9b62-55038ef0ec7b-0
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.948
He's already dressed in his
button down shirt and his

86802137-212b-4776-9b62-55038ef0ec7b-1
00:18:59.948 --> 00:19:03.697
waistcoat. Now he's putting his
jacket on. Then he's looking

86802137-212b-4776-9b62-55038ef0ec7b-2
00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:07.446
downwards and we see the snake
creature holding a hat in his

86802137-212b-4776-9b62-55038ef0ec7b-3
00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:10.520
mouth upwards. Like here you go,
here's your hat.

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-0
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.581
And in the next scene we we see
a city scene, like a busy street

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-1
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:24.493
scene with lots of people
around. We don't really get to

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-2
00:19:24.493 --> 00:19:28.062
see any details. Every
everything is backlit, so we

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-3
00:19:28.062 --> 00:19:32.180
really only see the silhouettes
of the people. There's some

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-4
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.710
banners hanging above everyone's
heads, but mostly it's just kind

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-5
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.623
of people walking around. Most
everyone is dressed to be

075e1d25-3b86-4fd3-beec-7f0ac0e4456d-6
00:19:40.623 --> 00:19:43.299
outdoors, lots of people wearing
hats.

14c34a4d-a817-49cc-8b87-4c0af3b3bd1c-0
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.737
And at least two or three that
we can see who have animal

14c34a4d-a817-49cc-8b87-4c0af3b3bd1c-1
00:19:47.737 --> 00:19:51.070
companions nearby, including our
friend, the man with the hat.

ff9b067d-ffa2-44dc-8228-e0aa96235d4c-0
00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.433
In the next few scenes, we just
see activities of like what's

ff9b067d-ffa2-44dc-8228-e0aa96235d4c-1
00:19:56.433 --> 00:20:00.847
going on around the town. In the
first scene there are men who

ff9b067d-ffa2-44dc-8228-e0aa96235d4c-2
00:20:00.847 --> 00:20:04.350
are at work, they're hoisting
something with long

656d9dff-8bf7-41f5-bbb7-e87e1f542d8f-0
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.242
Sticks or large, you know, large
canes maybe doing work in a

656d9dff-8bf7-41f5-bbb7-e87e1f542d8f-1
00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:14.878
factory. We see some some
chimneys behind them or some

656d9dff-8bf7-41f5-bbb7-e87e1f542d8f-2
00:20:14.878 --> 00:20:20.273
silos with smoke coming out of
them. In the scene after that we

656d9dff-8bf7-41f5-bbb7-e87e1f542d8f-3
00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:24.572
see a man with a big wide
brimmed hat feeding some

656d9dff-8bf7-41f5-bbb7-e87e1f542d8f-4
00:20:24.572 --> 00:20:30.052
creatures like that look like a
cross between fish and birds who

656d9dff-8bf7-41f5-bbb7-e87e1f542d8f-5
00:20:30.052 --> 00:20:33.930
are coming up to, you know,
expect food to be

fc005aa0-ce10-49b4-945e-d04d2a14fb21-0
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.490
Delivered to them from the man
with a big basket. In the scene

fc005aa0-ce10-49b4-945e-d04d2a14fb21-1
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.473
after that, it's kind of cut
off, but it looks like a

fc005aa0-ce10-49b4-945e-d04d2a14fb21-2
00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:44.953
transaction that takes place at
a store. A woman is exchanging

fc005aa0-ce10-49b4-945e-d04d2a14fb21-3
00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:47.936
money. It looks like we can't
really see what they're

fc005aa0-ce10-49b4-945e-d04d2a14fb21-4
00:20:47.936 --> 00:20:48.820
exchanging, but.

e2b9c2f0-73b5-4b7c-b629-c1e5379bc23e-0
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.000
They're passing something along.

1abd59b1-6675-4e7f-8b39-73be90cbd1c8-0
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.840
Over top of a counter where
there's some items there.

204c807e-979d-42bc-9137-dc2c908f9875-0
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.995
In the next scene, this might be
like a street artisan is working

204c807e-979d-42bc-9137-dc2c908f9875-1
00:20:59.995 --> 00:21:04.019
on something. It's it's just
kind of like a round disk, but

204c807e-979d-42bc-9137-dc2c908f9875-2
00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:07.908
it looks like it has some
intricate carvings or intricate

204c807e-979d-42bc-9137-dc2c908f9875-3
00:21:07.908 --> 00:21:11.395
design work done on it with
geometric patterns with

204c807e-979d-42bc-9137-dc2c908f9875-4
00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:15.620
something similar to that in the
background, like a rug maybe.

baab087d-c11a-45a0-aab7-bd1d559d11b2-0
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.610
In the scene after that, we've
seen a man up on a ladder and

baab087d-c11a-45a0-aab7-bd1d559d11b2-1
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.412
he's reaching down with like a a
stick or a paintbrush and it

baab087d-c11a-45a0-aab7-bd1d559d11b2-2
00:21:24.412 --> 00:21:27.968
looks like he's making some
designs onto a wall, but like

baab087d-c11a-45a0-aab7-bd1d559d11b2-3
00:21:27.968 --> 00:21:31.524
they're just large sweeping
motions. Doesn't seem obvious

baab087d-c11a-45a0-aab7-bd1d559d11b2-4
00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:32.690
what he's painting.

64123285-f170-4cce-8ea5-fd799f4a1800-0
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.406
And in the final scene on this
page, there's a woman who looks

64123285-f170-4cce-8ea5-fd799f4a1800-1
00:21:37.406 --> 00:21:40.895
like she's working on a
workbench, but it's a portable

64123285-f170-4cce-8ea5-fd799f4a1800-2
00:21:40.895 --> 00:21:44.638
workbench, like there's, you
know, it's on wheels. So it's

64123285-f170-4cce-8ea5-fd799f4a1800-3
00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:48.825
like she's she just moves around
town doing the kind of work that

64123285-f170-4cce-8ea5-fd799f4a1800-4
00:21:48.825 --> 00:21:49.840
she needs to do.

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-0
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:55.438
In the following page, there's
like 3-4, there's four larger

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-1
00:21:55.438 --> 00:22:00.157
scenes. The man with the hat has
gone up to a person who looks

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-2
00:22:00.157 --> 00:22:04.801
like, you know, he's maybe a
Baker or something. He's wearing

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-3
00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:09.594
an apron, a chef's hat, pointed
chefs hat. He's holding a bowl.

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-4
00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:13.489
The man with the hat is
gesturing with his hand and

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-5
00:22:13.489 --> 00:22:17.833
holding his hat in the other. It
looks like he's making a

ace50727-683f-4c75-9556-c17383d19152-6
00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:20.679
beseeching sort of like plea and
the.

5f3e5e16-54fe-4371-aa83-4a1a7e41221d-0
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.496
Man who's wearing the chef's
uniform is holding up his hand

5f3e5e16-54fe-4371-aa83-4a1a7e41221d-1
00:22:25.496 --> 00:22:30.044
and and looks like he has to
decline whatever the man with

5f3e5e16-54fe-4371-aa83-4a1a7e41221d-2
00:22:30.044 --> 00:22:34.979
the hat is trying to ask for. In
the next scene we see him, the

5f3e5e16-54fe-4371-aa83-4a1a7e41221d-3
00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.290
man with the hat.

bdaadf3d-ad95-4a3b-b919-7406dbd777e0-0
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.405
In a boiler room of some kind,
leaning down to speak with a

bdaadf3d-ad95-4a3b-b919-7406dbd777e0-1
00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:45.718
mechanic, the mechanic is
crouched down trying to fix some

bdaadf3d-ad95-4a3b-b919-7406dbd777e0-2
00:22:45.718 --> 00:22:50.250
kind of machinery. You know,
he's wearing work gloves. He has

930e9c45-57f0-496a-8b7f-27714e615e66-0
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.828
A wrench in his hand. His animal
companion holds a wrench in its

930e9c45-57f0-496a-8b7f-27714e615e66-1
00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:59.343
mouth, and once again the
mechanic is holding up a hand,

930e9c45-57f0-496a-8b7f-27714e615e66-2
00:22:59.343 --> 00:23:01.440
declining the man with the
hat's.

82df2655-5459-4325-8c83-00bd8377d8d7-0
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.770
ask. At this point, I'm going to
ask I'm I'm guessing the man

82df2655-5459-4325-8c83-00bd8377d8d7-1
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.235
with the hat needs a job and
he's going from place to place

82df2655-5459-4325-8c83-00bd8377d8d7-2
00:23:09.235 --> 00:23:10.160
to ask for work.

e59fd9d7-b886-4e8e-8da3-c7a9429a69c2-0
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.370
In the third scene, he's at the
interior of like an apothecary

e59fd9d7-b886-4e8e-8da3-c7a9429a69c2-1
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.920
or some other kind of shop that
would have lots of small bottles

e59fd9d7-b886-4e8e-8da3-c7a9429a69c2-2
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.330
and jars on shelving, and the
woman is standing at the counter

e59fd9d7-b886-4e8e-8da3-c7a9429a69c2-3
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.530
with all that stuff behind her
and she's all holding up two

e59fd9d7-b886-4e8e-8da3-c7a9429a69c2-4
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:28.950
hands.

6c2f6be2-b85b-418f-ab0c-0667f5bb94c0-0
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.389
With a look on her face also
saying, you know, like no.

6c2f6be2-b85b-418f-ab0c-0667f5bb94c0-1
00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:36.730
Unfortunately, whatever it is
you're asking, the answer is no.

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-0
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.899
And in the final scene on this
page, it looks like the man is

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-1
00:23:41.899 --> 00:23:45.722
at the airship yard. There's
lots of activities and work

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-2
00:23:45.722 --> 00:23:49.345
going on, sweeping, moving
things, taking care of the

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-3
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:53.235
airship on platforms, on a
pulley system. And once again,

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-4
00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:57.260
you know, he has his hands up
and the man he's talking with

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-5
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.419
holds up one hand once again,
probably in a, you know, sorry,

5641a59c-8395-4580-b448-cebdd577b198-6
00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:04.169
the answer is no gesture.
#END_arrival_5

b82fe7fb-2167-4194-9803-5a1c5cc864e3-0
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.720
OK, I'm going to pull up our
next.

b5bfa010-a67f-47f4-a0c7-45225dfb5fe5-0
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.510
One. OK, next we have another
complex scene.

355ba109-9040-41a6-9195-f2aea7faa727-0
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.750
OK, I'm going to share my screen
with the complex scene.

6a18b623-fe08-4383-b5db-639ce515429e-0
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:38.260
OK.

e67ef990-072c-425b-a9a8-d7e99831802e-0
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.410
And.

82ea208b-5e94-4230-89db-02b8acc6d571-0
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:02.680
OK, so just take 3 to 5 minutes
to describe what you see here.

b5867a92-20f3-4bf5-9a5a-a8555c223850-0
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:08.790
#START_picture_this So this is a
very involved and um.

5afe58ab-4767-488e-84e4-84bc35140ea3-0
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.170
Really.

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-0
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:17.260
Just like complicated picture of
a lot of pictures. So pictures

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-1
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.791
and frames sort of just
scattered around this scene,

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-2
00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:27.176
overlapping each other here and
there. The caption on this one

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-3
00:25:27.176 --> 00:25:32.391
reads picture this in, on the
upper left hand corner. So the

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-4
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:37.178
entire scene is comprised of
just images and scenes and

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-5
00:25:37.178 --> 00:25:42.392
people in picture frames, but
for two things. There's like a

d6b54e6f-2efb-4f68-9dc5-02d47f8e6612-6
00:25:42.392 --> 00:25:42.820
bird.

5ee4d5a7-bd89-45b0-bd3b-573ab2c3e292-0
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.049
That's on the left hand side,
that's not. It's actually just a

5ee4d5a7-bd89-45b0-bd3b-573ab2c3e292-1
00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:51.113
bird, not inside of a frame. And
there is a man in the bottom

5ee4d5a7-bd89-45b0-bd3b-573ab2c3e292-2
00:25:51.113 --> 00:25:54.850
right hand corner of this scene
who's also not framed in

5ee4d5a7-bd89-45b0-bd3b-573ab2c3e292-3
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.440
anything.

138eef0d-0835-4620-abce-bab61e35d465-0
00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:03.296
Scanning what's happening in all
of these scenes, there does not

138eef0d-0835-4620-abce-bab61e35d465-1
00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:08.636
seem to be any connected theme
or rhyme or reason to any of

138eef0d-0835-4620-abce-bab61e35d465-2
00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:14.155
these images. I mean it is just
pure random images. So just a

138eef0d-0835-4620-abce-bab61e35d465-3
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:19.051
couple of examples. Starting
from the middle and going

138eef0d-0835-4620-abce-bab61e35d465-4
00:26:19.051 --> 00:26:24.837
outwards, there's a scene where
a skier had, I guess rolled down

138eef0d-0835-4620-abce-bab61e35d465-5
00:26:24.837 --> 00:26:26.440
a hill and is now.

faeccdd1-83f3-4a3b-b8db-ce6dd4bef54f-0
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.602
has it's his head and limbs
sticking out of a giant

faeccdd1-83f3-4a3b-b8db-ce6dd4bef54f-1
00:26:30.602 --> 00:26:35.350
snowball. There's a scene where
somebody had been cloncked on

faeccdd1-83f3-4a3b-b8db-ce6dd4bef54f-2
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:40.098
the head with a giant playing
card. It looks like we can tell

faeccdd1-83f3-4a3b-b8db-ce6dd4bef54f-3
00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:44.616
he was cloncked on the head
because he's got like the star

faeccdd1-83f3-4a3b-b8db-ce6dd4bef54f-4
00:26:44.616 --> 00:26:47.910
circle dancing around the top of
his head.

b7e3a737-f2a9-4931-b909-66d493489178-0
00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.051
A little bit north of there.
Ohh. Waldo is very close to that

b7e3a737-f2a9-4931-b909-66d493489178-1
00:26:53.051 --> 00:26:54.040
guy, by the way.

0338a242-f3a4-47f3-9bfe-e003f8680baa-0
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.859
Going up the page from there,
there's like a giant whose head

0338a242-f3a4-47f3-9bfe-e003f8680baa-1
00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:04.089
is coming out of a thatched roof
cottage. It's kind of like a

0338a242-f3a4-47f3-9bfe-e003f8680baa-2
00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:08.251
waddle and beam cottage with a
thatched roof, and the Giants

0338a242-f3a4-47f3-9bfe-e003f8680baa-3
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:10.980
head is just coming from the top
of it.

4df7cb04-59bd-432e-8874-a7799a3735f1-0
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.530
Next to that is just a woman,
just who, just standing there

4df7cb04-59bd-432e-8874-a7799a3735f1-1
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.391
with her arms crossed. It's
possible she's standing next to

4df7cb04-59bd-432e-8874-a7799a3735f1-2
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:21.300
a man, but that's like on the
seam of the page. It's kind of

4df7cb04-59bd-432e-8874-a7799a3735f1-3
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:21.920
hard to know.

7fe686df-0b83-4071-a925-11cf218dd7a3-0
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.270
Umm.

46892b2d-b30e-40f5-8591-f543639720ec-0
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.570
A couple more scenes. As an
example, there is a.

a647745f-5dbe-4ef8-882b-93899047a6a5-0
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.566
There's a man leaning on a palm
tree, except that the palm tree

a647745f-5dbe-4ef8-882b-93899047a6a5-1
00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:38.852
is bent like where he's leaning
his hand as if he was so strong

a647745f-5dbe-4ef8-882b-93899047a6a5-2
00:27:38.852 --> 00:27:43.005
he bent the palm tree. And then
these dates maybe are falling

a647745f-5dbe-4ef8-882b-93899047a6a5-3
00:27:43.005 --> 00:27:46.756
out of the palm tree towards
somebody that was standing

a647745f-5dbe-4ef8-882b-93899047a6a5-4
00:27:46.756 --> 00:27:49.770
nearby who looks pretty
distressed about it.

57e203bd-d13e-448e-93e7-c3be79d33ee7-0
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.964
Towards the bottom left there's
a guy who just is being dragged

57e203bd-d13e-448e-93e7-c3be79d33ee7-1
00:27:55.964 --> 00:28:01.007
while he's holding on to a leash
by a dog that's just running at

57e203bd-d13e-448e-93e7-c3be79d33ee7-2
00:28:01.007 --> 00:28:05.662
an incredibly fast speed. The
guys hat has flown off of his

57e203bd-d13e-448e-93e7-c3be79d33ee7-3
00:28:05.662 --> 00:28:06.050
head.

fdff0cae-6eb3-4d0f-a534-360e139f069c-0
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.648
I don't know. There's no other
general way to describe all the

fdff0cae-6eb3-4d0f-a534-360e139f069c-1
00:28:12.648 --> 00:28:17.000
scenes that are happening. Like
I said, there's no rhyme or

fdff0cae-6eb3-4d0f-a534-360e139f069c-2
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.568
reason. It's just really silly
scenes happening in about maybe

fdff0cae-6eb3-4d0f-a534-360e139f069c-3
00:28:21.568 --> 00:28:25.630
I would say 2 to 300 of these
photos. #END_picture_this

bd4ec447-878e-41aa-9af8-f6d4e529da61-0
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.740
OK, perfect. Let's see what we
have next.

2cf4d29a-d9ff-4d44-90ed-3971982c1a05-0
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.510
OK, next we have another complex
scene.

d68d382f-a147-41c9-ac29-da21563d3723-0
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.300
Let me pull it out.

6efab7ac-beb2-487b-ab39-adf927532be0-0
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.050
OK, I'm going to share my
screen. Same thing as before.

6855010a-b382-4ae0-95fe-a5f6b118adb0-0
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.580
And I'll make it bigger, OK?

6000fb95-68f6-4034-97ac-a5811c097fe3-0
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:53.380
OK.

80add2d0-07e3-41cc-b2c3-7d499b8280f6-0
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.380
#START_by_the_lake OK, so in
this scene which is called by

80add2d0-07e3-41cc-b2c3-7d499b8280f6-1
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.293
the lake, according to the
caption, it is a, it's a, it's a

80add2d0-07e3-41cc-b2c3-7d499b8280f6-2
00:29:04.293 --> 00:29:09.287
lakeside scene somewhere in a
part of the country that would

80add2d0-07e3-41cc-b2c3-7d499b8280f6-3
00:29:09.287 --> 00:29:14.200
have snow capped mountains and
you know like a castle and a

80add2d0-07e3-41cc-b2c3-7d499b8280f6-4
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.440
chalet style cottages nearby. So
you know, you're thinking like

80add2d0-07e3-41cc-b2c3-7d499b8280f6-5
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.779
maybe Switzerland or Austria or
someplace like that.

bd9c2423-0e87-4399-a94c-397d88ca2a35-0
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:28.723
In the foreground we see a beach
scene happening with like, white

bd9c2423-0e87-4399-a94c-397d88ca2a35-1
00:29:28.723 --> 00:29:32.461
sand and sandcastles. So maybe
not Switzerland, maybe not

bd9c2423-0e87-4399-a94c-397d88ca2a35-2
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:36.521
Austria, you know, because you
don't really see these kinds of

bd9c2423-0e87-4399-a94c-397d88ca2a35-3
00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:40.645
like, white sand beaches in that
part of the world. Or, I don't

bd9c2423-0e87-4399-a94c-397d88ca2a35-4
00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.869
know, maybe you do.

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-0
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.561
And then in the middle of the
scene you've got people who are

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-1
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.739
in the water and doing all sorts
of water activities. And then

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-2
00:29:51.739 --> 00:29:55.387
towards the back we see
snowcapped mountains. We see a

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-3
00:29:55.387 --> 00:29:59.299
castle on the left hand side,
like a medieval style castle

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-4
00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:03.146
with turrets and pointed
rooftops. You know, and and then

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-5
00:30:03.146 --> 00:30:07.125
like a beach. Well, like a
mountainside cabin, kind of like

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-6
00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:11.170
on the right hand side, which is
actually more American than

2dba8adc-8f00-4992-b2e7-ba70bdc2c105-7
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.160
European. OK. So on the beach.

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-0
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.466
Scene down below, the kinds of
activities happening amongst

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-1
00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:21.843
the, you know, 80 or so people
down here are beach volleyball

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-2
00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:26.079
that's happening towards the
left. There's some sunbathers,

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-3
00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:30.456
somebody is standing knee deep
in the water holding a fishing

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-4
00:30:30.456 --> 00:30:34.974
net. There's an umbrella set up
with a cooler nearby and people

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-5
00:30:34.974 --> 00:30:39.069
just kind of hanging out and
lounging around. A couple is

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-6
00:30:39.069 --> 00:30:43.376
walking down the beach holding
hands. Down below somebody is

0193b6fe-2e15-4f4c-b82c-8de41ed2cf2f-7
00:30:43.376 --> 00:30:45.000
flying a multi colored.

ee73600e-fc2a-409d-bc9c-5e4ab0c93a37-0
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.510
kite, like a

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-0
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.626
Diamond shaped kite. There's a a
dingy nearby in front of which

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-1
00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:58.955
is a guy playing the guitar and
some people sitting around

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-2
00:30:58.955 --> 00:31:03.358
listening to the music he's
playing. On the right hand side

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-3
00:31:03.358 --> 00:31:07.027
there's some more just
sunbathing and people with

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-4
00:31:07.027 --> 00:31:11.650
coolers and umbrellas. A couple
of people are building a giant

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-5
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.979
sandcastle, so it's mostly
children with one adult looking

eda1370d-c639-4bf4-84f7-3e4229f5b461-6
00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:16.200
on.

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-0
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.244
And then if we look a little
further up, we see all the

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-1
00:31:21.244 --> 00:31:25.427
activities happening in the
water. So there's a dog playing

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-2
00:31:25.427 --> 00:31:29.541
with somebody wearing a bathing
suit in the water. There's

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-3
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:33.864
probably about, I don't know,
another 40 people in the water.

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-4
00:31:33.864 --> 00:31:38.186
Some are just swimming, some are
in kayaks, some are in inner

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-5
00:31:38.186 --> 00:31:42.370
tubes just floating around.
There's a small group of people

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-6
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:46.413
playing with a beach ball, a
couple of others on a banana

291c8b41-7dfe-44e2-8510-6a4f99aacd87-7
00:31:46.413 --> 00:31:47.390
boat, I think.

ba831df7-0d76-42f3-9d7c-80a6f02abdd8-0
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:54.321
Banana shaped blow up boat with
a pontoon maybe on one side, 3

ba831df7-0d76-42f3-9d7c-80a6f02abdd8-1
00:31:54.321 --> 00:31:58.020
people or so on a jet ski and
then.

77d2b7c1-3fe1-4972-8d09-47be2e7c5148-0
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.130
Probably about 10 or so people
all.

a144d1f8-aa7c-4ec5-a96b-a5074c3165d4-0
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.808
Crowded in together on a
platform. I don't know if that's

a144d1f8-aa7c-4ec5-a96b-a5074c3165d4-1
00:32:05.808 --> 00:32:08.930
called a pontoon or not, but
it's one of those like floating

a144d1f8-aa7c-4ec5-a96b-a5074c3165d4-2
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.052
platforms that you can climb up
on. It's got a ladder on one

a144d1f8-aa7c-4ec5-a96b-a5074c3165d4-3
00:32:12.052 --> 00:32:15.020
side and one person's climbing
up the ladder and a couple

a144d1f8-aa7c-4ec5-a96b-a5074c3165d4-4
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.170
people are jumping off on the
background.

974b412f-9125-4a91-acea-66a090b212c3-0
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.734
And then in the background we
see a water ski formation team

974b412f-9125-4a91-acea-66a090b212c3-1
00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:27.681
that's formed a pyramid. So like
the bottom 45678910 people are

974b412f-9125-4a91-acea-66a090b212c3-2
00:32:27.681 --> 00:32:32.086
all on water skis and then on
their shoulders is another

974b412f-9125-4a91-acea-66a090b212c3-3
00:32:32.086 --> 00:32:36.955
layer, so 12345 layers tall and
you know the person at the top

974b412f-9125-4a91-acea-66a090b212c3-4
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.970
is holding their hand up
triumphantly.

f2b97d2b-99cf-4d9e-bf69-91528fe20779-0
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.015
And yeah, and then finally in
the background, we've got people

f2b97d2b-99cf-4d9e-bf69-91528fe20779-1
00:32:45.015 --> 00:32:48.710
who are on, you know, like doing
some some parasailing.

d079fa10-7f04-4be8-9539-0c1ce9c917e6-0
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.873
So yeah, that's what's happening
here. Just lots of seaside

d079fa10-7f04-4be8-9539-0c1ce9c917e6-1
00:32:53.873 --> 00:32:57.414
activities or lakeside
activities. #END_by_the_lake OK,

d079fa10-7f04-4be8-9539-0c1ce9c917e6-2
00:32:57.414 --> 00:32:59.880
perfect. Let me see what we have
next.

8090c8b3-13b5-4dc8-ad12-711d7f2910ae-0
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.210
OK, next we have a short story.

6df98db0-c06d-4489-a357-af7a714e3544-0
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.160
We pull it up.

f3b5c2c2-0f00-4e4f-bdbf-bb00c960592c-0
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.250


7d629645-96a4-43af-b0a1-3a74375b4e87-0
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.770
OK, this one.

e12cf383-9597-4cab-aeaa-d35ff820d76b-0
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.710
All right, this one is about 26.

af86639c-856f-4327-a886-225b75e3706f-0
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.190
I'm going to.

dda84d2a-2f9f-46a9-86a7-17d819b0cd10-0
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.901
Put it in oh wait, I have to
share my screen and then I'll

dda84d2a-2f9f-46a9-86a7-17d819b0cd10-1
00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:29.110
put it in slideshow mode.

85847d9e-b937-43ca-ba4e-7ee212041342-0
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.930
Umm.

3bdcaf76-59b9-444d-922e-5f1fffdab445-0
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:34.940
OK.

6029c9c5-32a2-4d4d-b9d7-3968f091ce8e-0
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.570
You could start when you're
ready.

b925b2d8-b303-40b0-b388-c4c54e2770e8-0
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.629
#START_quest OK, so in this
scene we are looking at a rainy

b925b2d8-b303-40b0-b388-c4c54e2770e8-1
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:49.569
city scene, probably from it's
Central Park area, but we can

b925b2d8-b303-40b0-b388-c4c54e2770e8-2
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:54.105
see the Gray silhouette of some
tall skyscrapers in the

b925b2d8-b303-40b0-b388-c4c54e2770e8-3
00:33:54.105 --> 00:33:58.964
background. The scene we're
looking at has a park bench and

b925b2d8-b303-40b0-b388-c4c54e2770e8-4
00:33:58.964 --> 00:34:03.985
a street light to one side, and
the main part of the scene is

b925b2d8-b303-40b0-b388-c4c54e2770e8-5
00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:09.250
actually a sort of a pedestrian
walkway or a bridge under which.

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-0
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:13.845
are two boys, and one of them is
kind of holding what looks to be

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-1
00:34:13.845 --> 00:34:18.292
like a red crayon, and the other
one is holding a purple crayon,

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-2
00:34:18.292 --> 00:34:22.465
and he's reaching out and just
kind of like feeling the rain

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-3
00:34:22.465 --> 00:34:26.091
with one hand. So they're
trapped under this bridge.

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-4
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:30.470
Nearby is a bicycle. The front
tire is purple and the back tire

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-5
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:34.644
is red. The things that are
brightest in this scene, because

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-6
00:34:34.644 --> 00:34:38.612
everything has a sort of
monotone sepia tone, but the the

bf024e7b-899e-43c1-a8f7-2c91a796e304-7
00:34:38.612 --> 00:34:39.570
actual colors.

06ffd337-7b01-4967-af96-29fa4c257999-0
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.520
And really only the purple and
the red and there's a sort of

06ffd337-7b01-4967-af96-29fa4c257999-1
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.280
like highlighted area.

4b9c23d2-bc85-40b3-8de3-03c151d0de7e-0
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.440
Of this door that's underneath
the bridge.

d9e666de-216c-451b-879f-5beb9375ba14-0
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.260
In the next scene we see an a

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-0
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.407
King emerging from the doorway
and he is holding a orange

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-1
00:35:04.407 --> 00:35:09.563
crayon in one hand and I think
he's gesturing with a finger to

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-2
00:35:09.563 --> 00:35:14.556
his lips like a sort of like be
quiet kind of a thing. As he

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-3
00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:19.386
comes out of the doorway and
holds up a piece of paper for

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-4
00:35:19.386 --> 00:35:23.969
the two boys to look at, the
boys jump back, I think in

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-5
00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:28.880
surprise to see him. The paper
that he's holding has a ring

78866f52-fca5-4674-b426-d37da8f7f002-6
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.290
with.

63e14ae0-41c6-48fd-897e-73f8c6006311-0
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.611
246 colored dots on it. There
was a purple bird that was

63e14ae0-41c6-48fd-897e-73f8c6006311-1
00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:37.380
perched on one of the boy's
shoulders and the purple bird is

63e14ae0-41c6-48fd-897e-73f8c6006311-2
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.149
now alight, you know and and
just kind of like flying nearby

63e14ae0-41c6-48fd-897e-73f8c6006311-3
00:35:41.149 --> 00:35:43.930
but also looking down at the
sheet of paper.

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-0
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:49.319
In the next scene we see the
king, you know, speaking with

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-1
00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:54.036
the two boys. One of the boys is
now holding the sheet of paper

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-2
00:35:54.036 --> 00:35:58.312
and then we see some guards
coming out of the doorway and

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-3
00:35:58.312 --> 00:36:02.955
grabbing the king and pulling
him back through. The king loses

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-4
00:36:02.955 --> 00:36:07.083
the his grip on the Orange
Crayon and lets it go and it

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-5
00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:11.727
flies up in the air and then the
guards escort him through the

400333b5-4f91-4ed6-9ddf-fa44217d170c-6
00:36:11.727 --> 00:36:14.750
doorway. He tries to reach back
out but.

e239be75-9c93-4e29-9e1e-5917db4069c7-0
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.123
It's too late. The guards are
taking him back in, the orange

e239be75-9c93-4e29-9e1e-5917db4069c7-1
00:36:19.123 --> 00:36:23.638
crayon is on the ground and the
two boys are just looking on at

e239be75-9c93-4e29-9e1e-5917db4069c7-2
00:36:23.638 --> 00:36:25.190
this scene helplessly.

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-0
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.019
In the next scene, the doorway
is now closed. We get a better

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-1
00:36:32.019 --> 00:36:36.835
view of what the entire doorway
looks like. It's like a it's a

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-2
00:36:36.835 --> 00:36:41.651
pair of doors that kind of meet
up in an arch, but the rest of

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-3
00:36:41.651 --> 00:36:46.543
the archway is decorated with a
squid and some scenes that look

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-4
00:36:46.543 --> 00:36:50.518
like some some people
interacting, like a person on

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-5
00:36:50.518 --> 00:36:55.410
one side and possibly a mermaid
creature on the other side. The

8cd87a86-1c21-4328-ac1e-8d453486e53a-6
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.709
boys are outside.

70a77f7b-ee64-4def-af32-cd9459f5be0a-0
00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.574
The doorway. One of them is
holding up his own purple

70a77f7b-ee64-4def-af32-cd9459f5be0a-1
00:37:00.574 --> 00:37:04.930
Crayon, and the boy who had the
red crayon is now putting the

70a77f7b-ee64-4def-af32-cd9459f5be0a-2
00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.287
orange crayon that he picked up
from the ground into a into a

70a77f7b-ee64-4def-af32-cd9459f5be0a-3
00:37:09.287 --> 00:37:12.660
like a belt that he's wearing
around his chest.

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-0
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.494
All right. In the next scene,
that's like told in three

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-1
00:37:18.494 --> 00:37:22.933
different images. We've got the
boys now using their crayons to

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-2
00:37:22.933 --> 00:37:27.026
draw on the wall and on the
floor. So they're drawing like

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-3
00:37:27.026 --> 00:37:31.465
circle shapes with lines coming
out of them. In the next scene,

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-4
00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:35.418
we see that they're actually
keys, that they each drew a

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-5
00:37:35.418 --> 00:37:39.719
different style of key. So now
we have a red key and a purple

5066e0ea-7886-4d5b-b129-e9409c67e259-6
00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:44.020
key that they're holding up and
comparing them to each other.

ce6aba33-32d5-4d4f-b6e1-63bf3b9a26e7-0
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.527
And then in the final scene we
see them running through the

ce6aba33-32d5-4d4f-b6e1-63bf3b9a26e7-1
00:37:47.527 --> 00:37:51.084
doorway. The Red Key was used on
the left side, the Purple Key

ce6aba33-32d5-4d4f-b6e1-63bf3b9a26e7-2
00:37:51.084 --> 00:37:54.472
was used on the right side, and
they're running through the

ce6aba33-32d5-4d4f-b6e1-63bf3b9a26e7-3
00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:57.070
doorway and the bird is flying
in after them.

e384fe3b-f8e9-4194-ad21-dd955c991d34-0
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:05.482
In this next scene we get a full
on view of what's happening to

e384fe3b-f8e9-4194-ad21-dd955c991d34-1
00:38:05.482 --> 00:38:08.130
this particular like fantasy.

7948ffaf-04b7-4711-a8ac-c10de6d0a6dc-0
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:14.416
Castle. So it's a view from from
the moat. So we we kind of see

7948ffaf-04b7-4711-a8ac-c10de6d0a6dc-1
00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:18.444
that there's mountains in the
background, that there's

7948ffaf-04b7-4711-a8ac-c10de6d0a6dc-2
00:38:18.444 --> 00:38:22.911
airships on the left hand side
in the air. The castle itself

7948ffaf-04b7-4711-a8ac-c10de6d0a6dc-3
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:27.305
looks like it's in trouble.
There's fires happening on some

7948ffaf-04b7-4711-a8ac-c10de6d0a6dc-4
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:28.770
of the turrets, the.

39f9eb9d-c342-45ee-a675-bf31dff5b56c-0
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.283
The the building itself is
comprised of all of these like

39f9eb9d-c342-45ee-a675-bf31dff5b56c-1
00:38:34.283 --> 00:38:39.167
kind of turreted and tower areas
and most of them are all on

39f9eb9d-c342-45ee-a675-bf31dff5b56c-2
00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:41.650
fire. Down on the bottom right,

bd3a9728-4166-4ed1-87fc-2f7d3707b269-0
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:49.020
we see like this is still part
of the Moat of the castle, but

bd3a9728-4166-4ed1-87fc-2f7d3707b269-1
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:54.269
we see a a steamship or some
kind of a paddle boat going

bd3a9728-4166-4ed1-87fc-2f7d3707b269-2
00:38:54.269 --> 00:39:00.163
under one of the aqueducts, or
one under one of the bridges and

bd3a9728-4166-4ed1-87fc-2f7d3707b269-3
00:39:00.163 --> 00:39:03.940
it's the king is at the aft of
the boat.

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-0
00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:09.083
Sort of like above the paddle
area and he's being guarded. One

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-1
00:39:09.083 --> 00:39:13.277
of the guards is holding a spear
at the King's back. There's a

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-2
00:39:13.277 --> 00:39:17.271
couple of other guards nearby
and they're heading away from

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-3
00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:21.399
the scene under the bridge and
off the page on the right hand

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-4
00:39:21.399 --> 00:39:25.393
side. The two boys are watching
all of this happen. They're

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-5
00:39:25.393 --> 00:39:29.520
perched on a rock on the lower
left hand side of the page. We

bf0e9dda-5a75-4557-9460-35dc076347a5-6
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.250
see the doorway from which they
entered.

67bddaeb-08e8-4865-a65a-0d61062d4335-0
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:37.284
That's kind of behind a
waterfall. So kind of like I

67bddaeb-08e8-4865-a65a-0d61062d4335-1
00:39:37.284 --> 00:39:42.198
guess a secret area that they
emerged from and this is this is

67bddaeb-08e8-4865-a65a-0d61062d4335-2
00:39:42.198 --> 00:39:45.630
like they're looking at all of
this happen.

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-0
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.693
OK, so still behind their rock,
unseen, the boys are now

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-1
00:39:51.693 --> 00:39:56.030
referring to the page that they
got from the king. And one boy

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-2
00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.160
is pointing at the page, the
other boy is just kind of like

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-3
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.152
holding it and looking on in the
background we see just a

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-4
00:40:04.152 --> 00:40:08.351
different angle of the same
castle. You know, still on fire,

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-5
00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:12.481
the king on the boat still
heading off towards some kind of

5755c59c-643d-4b0b-b49a-5c7ad72e71f6-6
00:40:12.481 --> 00:40:14.339
just off into the distance.

c7ff6847-d9be-46a0-9c00-9cc2f88e9315-0
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:19.612
In the next scene, we get a
close-up view of what is on this

c7ff6847-d9be-46a0-9c00-9cc2f88e9315-1
00:40:19.612 --> 00:40:23.184
sheet of paper, and it is a
series of circles that are

c7ff6847-d9be-46a0-9c00-9cc2f88e9315-2
00:40:23.184 --> 00:40:27.017
connected by different lines.
Starting in the bottom right

c7ff6847-d9be-46a0-9c00-9cc2f88e9315-3
00:40:27.017 --> 00:40:31.239
hand of the scene, there's like
a purple circle with a palm tree

c7ff6847-d9be-46a0-9c00-9cc2f88e9315-4
00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:34.876
in it that's connected by a
purple line to a red circle

c7ff6847-d9be-46a0-9c00-9cc2f88e9315-5
00:40:34.876 --> 00:40:37.800
that's got some kind of like an
entranceway.

d7a558ad-18b9-4ec1-a454-0b3a807769cf-0
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.145
I think it's like a tree with a
door in it with lanterns on

d7a558ad-18b9-4ec1-a454-0b3a807769cf-1
00:40:43.145 --> 00:40:46.973
either side. The Red Circle is
connected by both by a purple

d7a558ad-18b9-4ec1-a454-0b3a807769cf-2
00:40:46.973 --> 00:40:50.927
circle and now also a red line.
Sorry, a purple line and a red

d7a558ad-18b9-4ec1-a454-0b3a807769cf-3
00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:54.943
line to an orange circle that's
got a city in it. And so on and

d7a558ad-18b9-4ec1-a454-0b3a807769cf-4
00:40:54.943 --> 00:40:56.450
so forth like every new.

2db5e5db-4335-45e0-acdb-1e4d40556709-0
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:01.432
Colored circle is connected by a
new line of that color and it

2db5e5db-4335-45e0-acdb-1e4d40556709-1
00:41:01.432 --> 00:41:05.059
progresses from Orange circle to
yellow circle to green circle to

2db5e5db-4335-45e0-acdb-1e4d40556709-2
00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:08.191
blue circle, so that the blue
and the purple are finally

2db5e5db-4335-45e0-acdb-1e4d40556709-3
00:41:08.191 --> 00:41:10.610
connected by all the colors of
the rainbow.

fa77baea-4d9c-4c2f-a13e-04209469355f-0
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:17.243
So the orange circle has like a
city, then the yellow circle has

fa77baea-4d9c-4c2f-a13e-04209469355f-1
00:41:17.243 --> 00:41:23.278
an underwater like a temple, and
then after that it looks like an

fa77baea-4d9c-4c2f-a13e-04209469355f-2
00:41:23.278 --> 00:41:23.370
a

b7f068fb-6008-4a6d-a1b5-96ba455a63e1-0
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:29.192
Bridge that connected to a tower
in the sky and then finally the

b7f068fb-6008-4a6d-a1b5-96ba455a63e1-1
00:41:29.192 --> 00:41:33.998
blue circle is a mountain. So
this gives the impression that

b7f068fb-6008-4a6d-a1b5-96ba455a63e1-2
00:41:33.998 --> 00:41:39.042
you know this is this, this is
the order of the adventures that

b7f068fb-6008-4a6d-a1b5-96ba455a63e1-3
00:41:39.042 --> 00:41:44.085
they have to go on. Behind all
of these circles is a hand drawn

b7f068fb-6008-4a6d-a1b5-96ba455a63e1-4
00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:48.813
map, so presumably the circles
are also indicating where in

b7f068fb-6008-4a6d-a1b5-96ba455a63e1-5
00:41:48.813 --> 00:41:51.020
this world these places are.

11338ba8-aefa-448e-9820-6d0c1a4b8c3b-0
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:58.033
All right, so now we get a view
of the kids behind the rock once

11338ba8-aefa-448e-9820-6d0c1a4b8c3b-1
00:41:58.033 --> 00:41:59.140
again, and the.

240b3bf6-2f9a-4134-bacc-fd6b863ac591-0
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:08.008
Across part of the Moat we see
some people in boats. One of the

240b3bf6-2f9a-4134-bacc-fd6b863ac591-1
00:42:08.008 --> 00:42:10.970
boats has a guy with a horned.

dd05dd33-d4b6-4dcd-94f9-8387581d89ed-0
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:16.872
Helmet, and he's next to a guard
that's holding like a a golden

dd05dd33-d4b6-4dcd-94f9-8387581d89ed-1
00:42:16.872 --> 00:42:18.750
bird cage of some kind.

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-0
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:24.153
And you get the impression that
the kids have been spotted. I

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-1
00:42:24.153 --> 00:42:27.605
think that the guy with the
horned helmet is pointing

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-2
00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:31.569
towards the rock where the kids
are hiding behind it, and the

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-3
00:42:31.569 --> 00:42:35.405
other guards are also facing
that same rock. So in the next

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-4
00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:39.305
scene, which is told in three
parts, we see the boys holding

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-5
00:42:39.305 --> 00:42:43.205
their crayons up to each other,
and then they're facing away

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-6
00:42:43.205 --> 00:42:46.913
from each other, using those
crayons to draw some things,

5cf6ef3a-b55a-4ce0-a920-a7b6f3bf6f78-7
00:42:46.913 --> 00:42:49.789
like the kid with the red crayon
is drawing.

b8e7553f-080e-425a-bc92-a059d31d719c-0
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.500
I think a diving helmet and some
fins and an air tank and the boy

b8e7553f-080e-425a-bc92-a059d31d719c-1
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.416
with the purple crayon is
drawing some tentacles. And then

b8e7553f-080e-425a-bc92-a059d31d719c-2
00:42:58.416 --> 00:42:59.810
finally you see them.

564b473a-0a85-4a19-8b17-700c3918427b-0
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:06.030
Go into the water so you see
their fins coming up from below.

02dd1865-60aa-4b50-a142-5ae2365fe73e-0
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:11.268
OK, so they worked together. The
boy with the Purple Gran Crayon

02dd1865-60aa-4b50-a142-5ae2365fe73e-1
00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:15.516
drew a creature, so he drew like
a giant squid, and the kid with

02dd1865-60aa-4b50-a142-5ae2365fe73e-2
00:43:15.516 --> 00:43:18.000
the red crayon drew for both of
them.

daa03764-b995-4fcb-92bb-5df7c4cedddf-0
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.690
Swimming fins and diving helmets
and air tanks.

534fb367-cd9e-4a52-8d65-18c2dab187c5-0
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:28.808
And even the bird, even the
purple bird has like a diving

534fb367-cd9e-4a52-8d65-18c2dab187c5-1
00:43:28.808 --> 00:43:33.706
helmet I guess. So the squid is
taking them far below the

534fb367-cd9e-4a52-8d65-18c2dab187c5-2
00:43:33.706 --> 00:43:38.857
surface of the water and we see
like an underwater temple in

534fb367-cd9e-4a52-8d65-18c2dab187c5-3
00:43:38.857 --> 00:43:43.080
this area that's kind of like
just surrounded by.

f58e23ac-5f05-4abd-9970-628ecb587345-0
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.866
Aqueducts and um, you know, we
see a shark swimming, we see a

f58e23ac-5f05-4abd-9970-628ecb587345-1
00:43:47.866 --> 00:43:51.318
couple of other fish swimming,
but there's this glow emanating

f58e23ac-5f05-4abd-9970-628ecb587345-2
00:43:51.318 --> 00:43:54.551
from the temple, so there's
definitely something happening

f58e23ac-5f05-4abd-9970-628ecb587345-3
00:43:54.551 --> 00:43:54.879
there.

355cfe70-daf9-491e-86c8-f756da7b8d1e-0
00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:01.627
So we see the boys enter the
temple area. There is a kind of

355cfe70-daf9-491e-86c8-f756da7b8d1e-1
00:44:01.627 --> 00:44:06.164
a shrine in the middle of the
temple of this, like statue of

355cfe70-daf9-491e-86c8-f756da7b8d1e-2
00:44:06.164 --> 00:44:10.924
seahorses with some kind of like
a shell at the top of it, like

355cfe70-daf9-491e-86c8-f756da7b8d1e-3
00:44:10.924 --> 00:44:15.610
it's a place to make an offering
of some kind. There's seaweed

355cfe70-daf9-491e-86c8-f756da7b8d1e-4
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.470
and there's coral nearby.

855e1c21-5609-44da-b234-1ce177a75df9-0
00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.393
It's hard to see because of the
screen, but I think that there's

855e1c21-5609-44da-b234-1ce177a75df9-1
00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:25.993
like a drawing at the base of
like where the statue stands and

855e1c21-5609-44da-b234-1ce177a75df9-2
00:44:25.993 --> 00:44:29.764
it looks as if it's a drawing of
like the king and maybe the boys

855e1c21-5609-44da-b234-1ce177a75df9-3
00:44:29.764 --> 00:44:32.450
doing something. It's hard to
see the details.

a1b4c3f9-ec82-487a-ba4e-0017d7bcb039-0
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.550
The boys are now swimming.

915d2a8d-edbd-488e-be20-34eecd2465cb-0
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.438
On either side of the seahorse
statue, and one of them is

915d2a8d-edbd-488e-be20-34eecd2465cb-1
00:44:41.438 --> 00:44:45.928
reaching kind of into it with
the orange crayon. Or no, this

915d2a8d-edbd-488e-be20-34eecd2465cb-2
00:44:45.928 --> 00:44:49.020
is a yellow crayon, so it's kind
of like.

d2350c49-9574-48e2-b9f9-b896819024ac-0
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.633
I guess that's maybe this is
where they found the yellow

d2350c49-9574-48e2-b9f9-b896819024ac-1
00:44:52.633 --> 00:44:52.980
crayon.

beeb09dc-6445-4d0f-bd5e-2468c00d977a-0
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:57.110
And then then they have to swim
away.

ddd5ceda-f248-4684-9840-01ae2f109b36-0
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:03.074
So now they are merging onto an
island and they're racing

ddd5ceda-f248-4684-9840-01ae2f109b36-1
00:45:03.074 --> 00:45:05.720
towards a Grove of palm trees.

66939f7d-8510-4afe-9a4e-177097177f69-0
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.565
One is like reaching back to
help the other come out of the

66939f7d-8510-4afe-9a4e-177097177f69-1
00:45:11.565 --> 00:45:15.741
water, and the next scene the
boy with the purple crayon is

66939f7d-8510-4afe-9a4e-177097177f69-2
00:45:15.741 --> 00:45:19.847
drawing a big humped something
with the red crayon drawing

66939f7d-8510-4afe-9a4e-177097177f69-3
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:22.770
maybe some kind of a saddle on
top of it.

ea6e2ec6-7315-4cfa-af04-812d498943bf-0
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.300
I think I figured out. The kid
with the purple crayon can only

ea6e2ec6-7315-4cfa-af04-812d498943bf-1
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.801
draw like creatures, whereas the
kid with the red crayon draws

ea6e2ec6-7315-4cfa-af04-812d498943bf-2
00:45:30.801 --> 00:45:31.190
things.

7fd4762e-2f57-403b-b912-8b442751ff9a-0
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.800
OK, Yep, so.

6a275dd4-3104-4584-91a5-4d19ea72b4f8-0
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.841
All right. So now we see an
overview of this jungle scene

6a275dd4-3104-4584-91a5-4d19ea72b4f8-1
00:45:41.841 --> 00:45:46.089
with like an A couple of like
Aztec style temples in the

6a275dd4-3104-4584-91a5-4d19ea72b4f8-2
00:45:46.089 --> 00:45:50.560
background. The kids are on the
back of a rhinoceros that's

6a275dd4-3104-4584-91a5-4d19ea72b4f8-3
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.403
traveling down a trail. We kind
of see them from a distance. The

6a275dd4-3104-4584-91a5-4d19ea72b4f8-4
00:45:55.403 --> 00:46:00.098
rhinoceros is purple and they're
riding in some kind of like a

6a275dd4-3104-4584-91a5-4d19ea72b4f8-5
00:46:00.098 --> 00:46:02.930
sedan, I guess, like a saddle
with a.

fb8b32a7-fc89-4e82-9dea-36ef74ca7479-0
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:04.920
Covering.

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-0
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.683
That's red that the kid with the
red crayon drew. So the

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-1
00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:13.665
rhinoceros is traveling down a
path towards the these Aztec

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-2
00:46:13.665 --> 00:46:17.913
temples and in the background we
see that connected to a Cliff.

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-3
00:46:17.913 --> 00:46:21.961
Way in the background is this
drawstring bridge or this rope

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-4
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.275
bridge that's connected to this
tower that's kind of like in the

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-5
00:46:26.275 --> 00:46:30.324
middle of the water. And we see
this beacon of light sort of

34b7cd5d-652f-4ad1-9193-d2dd018d2308-6
00:46:30.324 --> 00:46:33.509
yellow light coming from the top
of that tower.

8762486d-0e8f-4db8-8336-62406c58178a-0
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.190
OK, so now we actually get an
overview or like.

93553b7f-f2b3-4c42-bdb7-382429ddf2f4-0
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.240
General view of that bridge
that's stems from one end of

93553b7f-f2b3-4c42-bdb7-382429ddf2f4-1
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.760
page one and goes to the other
end of page 2.

95370a3d-abed-4171-856f-f1d8a69e31ab-0
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:54.851
And it's a real rickety looking,
unreliable looking rope bridge.

95370a3d-abed-4171-856f-f1d8a69e31ab-1
00:46:54.851 --> 00:46:58.766
The kids are crossing the
bridge, the bird is flying

95370a3d-abed-4171-856f-f1d8a69e31ab-2
00:46:58.766 --> 00:47:03.494
overhead and they are on their
way towards the top of the tower

95370a3d-abed-4171-856f-f1d8a69e31ab-3
00:47:03.494 --> 00:47:07.409
that's the other side of the
bridge is connected to.

5a538926-6159-43ab-8aad-b9bb89907825-0
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:12.240
At the top of the tower is
another.

06755dc0-b47a-489d-b59b-f7e60681c7ee-0
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:18.223
You know is another sort of like
statue or or a place like where

06755dc0-b47a-489d-b59b-f7e60681c7ee-1
00:47:18.223 --> 00:47:19.920
an offering can be made.

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-0
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.524
And it's, it's glowing yellow,
but one of the boys' head's is

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-1
00:47:24.524 --> 00:47:28.419
kind of like covering it, so
it's hard to see what's actually

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-2
00:47:28.419 --> 00:47:32.250
there. They're looking down
below at the rope bridge because

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-3
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:36.082
now the guards are down there
and on their way over to where

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-4
00:47:36.082 --> 00:47:39.851
the boys are. And so, you know,
you get the impression that

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-5
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:43.745
whatever they're doing, they're
going to have to act quickly.

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-6
00:47:43.745 --> 00:47:47.577
And in the next scene they're
drawing again. So the boy with

e28e3512-b639-41cd-924c-16204e6b081d-7
00:47:47.577 --> 00:47:50.530
the red crayon is drawing some
kind of like a.

16f6a3cb-58fd-4fe1-bd15-f040f403b847-0
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:56.656
Board and the purple crayon got
kid is drawing some elongated

16f6a3cb-58fd-4fe1-bd15-f040f403b847-1
00:47:56.656 --> 00:48:01.630
Oval shapes, thinner at one end
than on the other.

06fe0faa-1bf1-4269-8a81-091764d77d6d-0
00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:08.346
Possibly wings. Yep, dragonfly
wings. OK, so now the kids are

06fe0faa-1bf1-4269-8a81-091764d77d6d-1
00:48:08.346 --> 00:48:13.161
on the board, which turned out
to be the seat of a swing

06fe0faa-1bf1-4269-8a81-091764d77d6d-2
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:18.060
connected to a giant dragonfly
which is taking them away.

f06f8b49-9ab9-4545-aa3e-9cebf4efd988-0
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.430
It looks as if the kid that's
wearing the um.

6eb1e265-b006-474c-a3b0-d6684ea7461e-0
00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:28.760
The holster now has like a green
crayon in there.

2ca820b3-c2ae-4018-b746-9c38403ef0c3-0
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.419
And they're escaping just in
time as the guards are trying to

2ca820b3-c2ae-4018-b746-9c38403ef0c3-1
00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:36.430
reach up and grab their feet.

a96f6825-658e-4857-be3a-2aea98e97ac2-0
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.975
And they're heading towards the
snowcapped mountains in the

a96f6825-658e-4857-be3a-2aea98e97ac2-1
00:48:39.975 --> 00:48:40.460
background.

ea73b678-0fba-4897-a352-39726aee3d6b-0
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.974
The dragonfly deposits them at
the top of yet another temple.

ea73b678-0fba-4897-a352-39726aee3d6b-1
00:48:44.974 --> 00:48:48.333
This kind of looks like it's
been inspired by a Buddhist

ea73b678-0fba-4897-a352-39726aee3d6b-2
00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:51.929
temple. There's a statue of a
man sitting cross legged, eyes

ea73b678-0fba-4897-a352-39726aee3d6b-3
00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:55.230
closed, with a sash around one
arm, and he's wearing a.

6462ea60-79d6-4f6e-b1a4-4ef91a72b30e-0
00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:02.610
He's he's wearing some kind of
like a helmet or a hat, and the

6462ea60-79d6-4f6e-b1a4-4ef91a72b30e-1
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.180
temple has these lanterns built
into them.

6b10f936-f144-4de3-bee8-f2b678ebcbd0-0
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:12.080
The top of the temple is this
conical shaped.

d9a2d9ee-fcbc-4c22-85a3-35aa06c0de69-0
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.789
Piece of stone. It's like I
don't know the the top of what

d9a2d9ee-fcbc-4c22-85a3-35aa06c0de69-1
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.450
looks like a Faberge egg.

a04a10b3-d85f-40cb-a57f-8d592c550d0a-0
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:25.448
The the kid with the holster of
all of the different colored

a04a10b3-d85f-40cb-a57f-8d592c550d0a-1
00:49:25.448 --> 00:49:29.003
crayons is now taking it and
holding it upright like he's

a04a10b3-d85f-40cb-a57f-8d592c550d0a-2
00:49:29.003 --> 00:49:30.720
going to be doing something.

e7772f54-8ddb-44bf-9118-3ac6f96bde82-0
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.500
With the conical shape part of
the top of this temple.

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-0
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.198
However, it looks like before
any of that could actually

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-1
00:49:42.198 --> 00:49:46.260
happen, there's now a couple of
airships that have been dropped

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-2
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.322
in, and the guy with the horned
helmet is on one of them and is

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-3
00:49:50.322 --> 00:49:54.321
reaching towards the bird, and
the other guard is on the other

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-4
00:49:54.321 --> 00:49:57.812
airship and he's reaching
towards the bird holding the

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-5
00:49:57.812 --> 00:50:01.811
golden cage. The bird looks like
it's holding the holster with

028542fe-6b47-4084-b852-6850648c4791-6
00:50:01.811 --> 00:50:03.970
all of the colored crayons in
it.

b7634533-b960-4c52-987c-134e6d5eba38-0
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.255
So, um, so that's happening on
one page. On the other page is

b7634533-b960-4c52-987c-134e6d5eba38-1
00:50:09.255 --> 00:50:13.444
just additional airships to give
the impression that the kids are

b7634533-b960-4c52-987c-134e6d5eba38-2
00:50:13.444 --> 00:50:15.920
kind of just surrounded at this
point.

7253e6d8-3249-4af3-a2bb-04554c55d1f2-0
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:23.458
And as the bird flies away, back
towards the city with the

7253e6d8-3249-4af3-a2bb-04554c55d1f2-1
00:50:23.458 --> 00:50:28.898
castles, with the castle in it,
there is a rainbow emerging from

7253e6d8-3249-4af3-a2bb-04554c55d1f2-2
00:50:28.898 --> 00:50:34.255
the band of colored crayons from
like that the bird is carrying

7253e6d8-3249-4af3-a2bb-04554c55d1f2-3
00:50:34.255 --> 00:50:35.260
in its feet.

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-0
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:41.093
The rainbow arcs from this
holster all the way back towards

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-1
00:50:41.093 --> 00:50:46.127
where this temple is, and it's
shining brightly. The kids, the

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-2
00:50:46.127 --> 00:50:51.320
the one whose face we can see is
lit up in a smile. We can't see

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-3
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:56.433
with the other kid because he's
facing away from us, but we can

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-4
00:50:56.433 --> 00:51:01.147
see that the reaction from the
guards is that they are not

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-5
00:51:01.147 --> 00:51:06.260
happy. The guy with the horned
helmet is raising his fist up in

54997c1c-c10e-47b2-af9e-f7b237b5e6f8-6
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:06.819
defeat.

9b7fdf1f-8fde-4ae4-bdb8-6edf81f6754a-0
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.411
You know, shaking his arm in
defiance, the other airships

9b7fdf1f-8fde-4ae4-bdb8-6edf81f6754a-1
00:51:10.411 --> 00:51:13.630
look like they've actually kind
of like, lost their.

0bc867ac-3606-415a-b072-c98e27287126-0
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.369
Ability to fly upright, and some
of the guards are falling off of

0bc867ac-3606-415a-b072-c98e27287126-1
00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:23.451
the airship. They've been turned
sideways, so they may actually

0bc867ac-3606-415a-b072-c98e27287126-2
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:26.640
just be falling, like falling
towards the ground.

77f64275-8bab-423d-9fb2-add597cb886b-0
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:30.670
Umm.

242e6e32-cf50-4e56-a245-7ee93d58c7a5-0
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:36.145
OK, so in this next scene we get
a view from the city. The Moat

242e6e32-cf50-4e56-a245-7ee93d58c7a5-1
00:51:36.145 --> 00:51:40.430
still has the ship on it that's
carrying the king away from the

242e6e32-cf50-4e56-a245-7ee93d58c7a5-2
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:44.046
city. Except that in the
distance we can see the snow

242e6e32-cf50-4e56-a245-7ee93d58c7a5-3
00:51:44.046 --> 00:51:47.729
topped mountain with the with
the temple on it. In the

242e6e32-cf50-4e56-a245-7ee93d58c7a5-4
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:51.948
distance we can see the start of
an arc of a rainbow coming up

242e6e32-cf50-4e56-a245-7ee93d58c7a5-5
00:51:51.948 --> 00:51:53.889
from the temple into the air.

dec93e86-9045-4654-98a0-406ed502b4b5-0
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.097
And then we lose, you know, like
on the top of that arc, because

dec93e86-9045-4654-98a0-406ed502b4b5-1
00:51:59.097 --> 00:52:03.014
it goes off the page entirely,
but it actually comes back down.

dec93e86-9045-4654-98a0-406ed502b4b5-2
00:52:03.014 --> 00:52:06.931
The rainbow ends its arc on the
ship itself that's carrying the

dec93e86-9045-4654-98a0-406ed502b4b5-3
00:52:06.931 --> 00:52:10.970
king, and the king has risen his
hands in triumph as he's looking

dec93e86-9045-4654-98a0-406ed502b4b5-4
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.030
away towards the mountain from
which the rainbow.

5d757c06-3cbe-4fc0-ab2b-0c1847b311ae-0
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.556
Originated and I think that the
ship was carrying additional

5d757c06-3cbe-4fc0-ab2b-0c1847b311ae-1
00:52:20.556 --> 00:52:25.632
prisoners who have also raised
their hands in triumph as the

5d757c06-3cbe-4fc0-ab2b-0c1847b311ae-2
00:52:25.632 --> 00:52:30.874
guards are falling off of the
ship. The bird is nearby, so the

5d757c06-3cbe-4fc0-ab2b-0c1847b311ae-3
00:52:30.874 --> 00:52:35.701
the bird is still holding the
the belt of colors and it's

5d757c06-3cbe-4fc0-ab2b-0c1847b311ae-4
00:52:35.701 --> 00:52:41.110
feet. And so you got I guess the
idea that the bird flew, as the

5d757c06-3cbe-4fc0-ab2b-0c1847b311ae-5
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:46.020
bird flew, the rainbow followed
it, some of the bird flew.

a3731690-9cc1-47a5-9bbd-80cf5d223a58-0
00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:50.044
Towards this boat in order to, I
don't (know), bring the rainbow

a3731690-9cc1-47a5-9bbd-80cf5d223a58-1
00:52:50.044 --> 00:52:50.410
magic.

c25b1b36-85ec-4e6b-a0a9-48b4c895f208-0
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:58.070
And now we get a view of a
different part of the Kingdom.

c25b1b36-85ec-4e6b-a0a9-48b4c895f208-1
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:02.506
You know, we see all the parts
of the castles in the background

c25b1b36-85ec-4e6b-a0a9-48b4c895f208-2
00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:06.665
and part of the aqueduct we see
in the foreground with, you

c25b1b36-85ec-4e6b-a0a9-48b4c895f208-3
00:53:06.665 --> 00:53:10.547
know, people kind of like on
boats or just kind of like

c25b1b36-85ec-4e6b-a0a9-48b4c895f208-4
00:53:10.547 --> 00:53:12.349
walking through the water.

45bfa44a-bce8-4b56-b09d-70d7061280a8-0
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:18.901
I think the the rainbow appears
in the background, arching over

45bfa44a-bce8-4b56-b09d-70d7061280a8-1
00:53:18.901 --> 00:53:24.513
the sky. You know, everything is
sort of dancing with colors at

45bfa44a-bce8-4b56-b09d-70d7061280a8-2
00:53:24.513 --> 00:53:29.512
this point. Before everything
was had that kind of sepia

45bfa44a-bce8-4b56-b09d-70d7061280a8-3
00:53:29.512 --> 00:53:34.861
monotone, but here everything
has vibrant colors. The people

45bfa44a-bce8-4b56-b09d-70d7061280a8-4
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:39.771
that we can see look like
they're happy. We see the two

45bfa44a-bce8-4b56-b09d-70d7061280a8-5
00:53:39.771 --> 00:53:40.210
kids.

cea97fa7-87fb-4a9d-9207-d330aade0173-0
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:44.345
Riding on the back of their
rhinoceros, still in that red

cea97fa7-87fb-4a9d-9207-d330aade0173-1
00:53:44.345 --> 00:53:47.838
sedan, the king is in front of
them, waving to his people. The

cea97fa7-87fb-4a9d-9207-d330aade0173-2
00:53:47.838 --> 00:53:51.110
rhinoceros itself is on the back
of that same paddle boat.

fe7ce50c-e486-42c4-a9d9-fa00e9f6ad67-0
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.615
And they're just making their
way down one of these aqueducts,

fe7ce50c-e486-42c4-a9d9-fa00e9f6ad67-1
00:53:56.615 --> 00:54:00.782
kind of waving it with triumph
to all of the people of this

fe7ce50c-e486-42c4-a9d9-fa00e9f6ad67-2
00:54:00.782 --> 00:54:01.130
city.

9ffebf65-8e93-4fd6-9583-a1d6a733995b-0
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.587
At the end of the scene we see
that the boat has arrived back

9ffebf65-8e93-4fd6-9583-a1d6a733995b-1
00:54:08.587 --> 00:54:10.750
at that rock where the kids had
been.

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-0
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.423
Had used for cover when they
first entered this Kingdom. The

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-1
00:54:16.423 --> 00:54:20.960
King is helping them off of the
back of the rhinoceros and down

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-2
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.567
towards the rock once again. And
then in the background we still

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-3
00:54:25.567 --> 00:54:29.820
see, you know, like this, the
city, the rainbow, even this,

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-4
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.143
even the rock from which the
waterfall is is coming up above

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-5
00:54:34.143 --> 00:54:38.538
like now has flowers and plants
on it, whereas before I don't

1a7cf54d-e1bb-43b0-8292-7b91ad275229-6
00:54:38.538 --> 00:54:39.460
think it did.

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-0
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.859
The next scene told in three
parts is the King using his

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-1
00:54:44.859 --> 00:54:49.325
orange crayon to Draw Something
up on the wall, something like

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-2
00:54:49.325 --> 00:54:53.861
pointed. And then, oh he in the
next scene is reaching down and

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-3
00:54:53.861 --> 00:54:58.042
putting a crown on one of the
boys. And in the final scene

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-4
00:54:58.042 --> 00:55:02.437
both boys who now have crowns
are leaving through the doorway

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-5
00:55:02.437 --> 00:55:06.406
and the king is holding his
hands, both of them pressed

79226401-96ec-4642-badd-45992db8accf-6
00:55:06.406 --> 00:55:09.950
together towards his lips in a
gesture of thanks.

201af9df-8999-4b59-85d3-899e26966d0d-0
00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:14.290
As the boys waved goodbye as
they walk through the doorway.

0feed960-9b8d-46ce-b5fc-f73c7aa47f98-0
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.520
Finally, we see the city scene
once again. From the view of

0feed960-9b8d-46ce-b5fc-f73c7aa47f98-1
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.381
being in the doorway. We see the
backs of both boys looking

0feed960-9b8d-46ce-b5fc-f73c7aa47f98-2
00:55:23.381 --> 00:55:27.306
towards the city, which now once
again has all of these more

0feed960-9b8d-46ce-b5fc-f73c7aa47f98-3
00:55:27.306 --> 00:55:31.359
vibrant colors, whereas before
it was more sepia and monotone.

37b86f79-0179-47d6-b2f0-9d71de1bc3bd-0
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:37.998
So we see the cityscape, we see
some skyscrapers, and we also

37b86f79-0179-47d6-b2f0-9d71de1bc3bd-1
00:55:37.998 --> 00:55:43.047
see this rainbow, which is like
arching over the city, and the

37b86f79-0179-47d6-b2f0-9d71de1bc3bd-2
00:55:43.047 --> 00:55:48.257
same arc follows the arc of the
bridge that they're under. So it

37b86f79-0179-47d6-b2f0-9d71de1bc3bd-3
00:55:48.257 --> 00:55:53.306
creates this centralized focal
point on the boys in the middle

37b86f79-0179-47d6-b2f0-9d71de1bc3bd-4
00:55:53.306 --> 00:55:55.309
of this scene. #END_quest

e27b9e03-832e-4acb-8e17-da3bbe82face-0
00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:58.570
And that's it.

0019fa75-5f5e-40b6-95b9-9f439b38bc9a-0
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:10.840
Sorry, you were muted.

5f3ac0fd-03fd-418e-a862-1d71851896dd-0
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:18.636
Sorry. OK. So we have a short
story next. We're almost through

5f3ac0fd-03fd-418e-a862-1d71851896dd-1
00:56:18.636 --> 00:56:23.587
with our stimuli, so that's
good. I'm just trying to make

5f3ac0fd-03fd-418e-a862-1d71851896dd-2
00:56:23.587 --> 00:56:25.550
sure I could fit it in.

43664573-b2a0-4a3e-b453-5a81dd40c834-0
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.200


11bd6258-dda4-4c92-8b63-b155153ac92e-0
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.220
OK, so this.

15618094-6ddf-4fe2-aaff-92c75c01dc92-0
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:35.582
Short story is going to be 5
slides. Same thing as before.

15618094-6ddf-4fe2-aaff-92c75c01dc92-1
00:56:35.582 --> 00:56:39.170
Let me know when you would like
me to move on.

6bc8ba9a-24a4-4bec-9b51-fa5895e3b78b-0
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.631
And I'll do so. OK, alright,
sounds good. #START_arrival_1

6bc8ba9a-24a4-4bec-9b51-fa5895e3b78b-1
00:56:44.631 --> 00:56:47.190
Alright, so this scene is broken
into.

b21d2544-8bce-4982-9383-f54c2f14b1bb-0
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.930
9, 9 different parts.

74dd294a-9609-40de-beca-009a8a44972e-0
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.070
In this first scene, we see.

8959d722-f1f7-4528-8b7c-72e96297f87f-0
00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:01.559
A view of a picture frame and
like, there's a it's a family

8959d722-f1f7-4528-8b7c-72e96297f87f-1
00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:05.925
portrait. There's a mother and a
father and a child wearing some

8959d722-f1f7-4528-8b7c-72e96297f87f-2
00:57:05.925 --> 00:57:09.485
kind of like a white dress
sitting in front of them.

8959d722-f1f7-4528-8b7c-72e96297f87f-3
00:57:09.485 --> 00:57:13.447
Everything here is black and
white, sort of with a sort of

8959d722-f1f7-4528-8b7c-72e96297f87f-4
00:57:13.447 --> 00:57:15.530
sepia tone. Then we see a hand.

a2f56a53-6f45-4b90-9677-40329268803f-0
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.540
Picking the picture frame up
from its ledge.

d171def1-385c-4306-ae52-d870d106c671-0
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.654
And then next we see it being
placed inside of a sack or

d171def1-385c-4306-ae52-d870d106c671-1
00:57:23.654 --> 00:57:27.473
something. We're only seeing the
hands, we're not seeing who's

d171def1-385c-4306-ae52-d870d106c671-2
00:57:27.473 --> 00:57:28.140
doing this.

e91ad052-4869-4330-a2ef-1adbe8b95007-0
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:34.732
After that we see that it's not
quite a sack. It was more of a

e91ad052-4869-4330-a2ef-1adbe8b95007-1
00:57:34.732 --> 00:57:39.558
wrapping like it's it was
wrapped in either paper or some

e91ad052-4869-4330-a2ef-1adbe8b95007-2
00:57:39.558 --> 00:57:44.385
kind of a fabric or piece of
cloth and then the person is

e91ad052-4869-4330-a2ef-1adbe8b95007-3
00:57:44.385 --> 00:57:47.879
securing it with twine or yarn
or string.

76a33f20-1117-4183-a0b9-6af76f11a017-0
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.530
Wrapped around both with.

4b38577a-9141-44aa-9ab2-f4581470fe1b-0
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:57.516
Lengthwise and widthwise, you
know, wrapped both ways and they

4b38577a-9141-44aa-9ab2-f4581470fe1b-1
00:57:57.516 --> 00:58:02.703
were tying up a bow on the top.
Then we see the hands taking the

4b38577a-9141-44aa-9ab2-f4581470fe1b-2
00:58:02.703 --> 00:58:07.730
package, but we don't really see
what's happening. And then we

4b38577a-9141-44aa-9ab2-f4581470fe1b-3
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:12.597
see the hands on top of a a
briefcase. So presumably it went

4b38577a-9141-44aa-9ab2-f4581470fe1b-4
00:58:12.597 --> 00:58:15.549
inside of a suitcase or a
briefcase.

2b988261-19c6-4da8-a02b-61ba3da5d84f-0
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:20.909
And then we see the hands
clasping the sides of the case.

2b988261-19c6-4da8-a02b-61ba3da5d84f-1
00:58:20.909 --> 00:58:25.231
So this case has a belt around
the side of it, and they're

2b988261-19c6-4da8-a02b-61ba3da5d84f-2
00:58:25.231 --> 00:58:29.700
tightening it up. And now they
have one hand laid across the

2b988261-19c6-4da8-a02b-61ba3da5d84f-3
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.509
top of the suitcase, and then
there's another hand.

d16c600d-b332-4236-8222-857189dfae4a-0
00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:40.178
I guess that's the same person.
So they've laid both of their

d16c600d-b332-4236-8222-857189dfae4a-1
00:58:40.178 --> 00:58:46.076
hands on top of the belt. It's
kind of a gesture of like, you

d16c600d-b332-4236-8222-857189dfae4a-2
00:58:46.076 --> 00:58:48.170
know, it's secure now.

d191c9f5-ece3-41c7-bb5a-e3846b4e3485-0
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:59.006
The next scene, also told in
nine parts, is just objects at

d191c9f5-ece3-41c7-bb5a-e3846b4e3485-1
00:58:59.006 --> 00:59:04.613
first. So first it's an it's a
paper bird that's just perched

d191c9f5-ece3-41c7-bb5a-e3846b4e3485-2
00:59:04.613 --> 00:59:06.060
on a countertop.

3f1d2db0-581c-45a1-92d8-b174fd54778c-0
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:11.071
Next it's an old fashioned
mantle clock, like a wind up

3f1d2db0-581c-45a1-92d8-b174fd54778c-1
00:59:11.071 --> 00:59:11.520
clock.

5ece09e5-3fe2-4d8b-8096-eb996f36ffd7-0
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.792
Next it's a hat hanging on a
hook with a piece of fabric

5ece09e5-3fe2-4d8b-8096-eb996f36ffd7-1
00:59:17.792 --> 00:59:18.410
nearby.

43796897-b1a2-4ae8-8633-18d633e750dd-0
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:25.767
Next it's a pot with its lid on,
but ajar, with a wooden spoon

43796897-b1a2-4ae8-8633-18d633e750dd-1
00:59:25.767 --> 00:59:28.460
lying on the cabinet nearby.

f3b82446-f007-4316-b6b5-f14e874f26d4-0
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:34.826
Next we have a child's drawing
of of family. It's got father

f3b82446-f007-4316-b6b5-f14e874f26d4-1
00:59:34.826 --> 00:59:38.770
with a hat, mother wearing a
triangle dress.

6afc5e1d-7065-47b8-8e34-153b2b7bd91b-0
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.610
And then a child between them
holding hands with both of them.

45c46832-cf51-4164-a9d2-b6000422c31f-0
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.279
Next we've got a teapot with
Steam coming out of its spout

45c46832-cf51-4164-a9d2-b6000422c31f-1
00:59:50.279 --> 00:59:54.955
and the teapot's cracked down
one side. Next we've got a

45c46832-cf51-4164-a9d2-b6000422c31f-2
00:59:54.955 --> 00:59:59.548
couple of tea in a Tea Cup
sitting on a saucer. I think

45c46832-cf51-4164-a9d2-b6000422c31f-3
00:59:59.548 --> 01:00:04.798
there's steam coming out of the
the the teacup, and in front of

45c46832-cf51-4164-a9d2-b6000422c31f-4
01:00:04.798 --> 01:00:10.130
that, lying nearby, are pictures
of something like or pamphlets,

45c46832-cf51-4164-a9d2-b6000422c31f-5
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:14.150
but one of them is actually of
an old fashioned.

228950bd-3b2f-48bb-b244-ac9c262df18b-0
01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.580
Steamship with smoke coming out
of its chimneys.

742851a6-fdd9-40db-a4a3-49fe7fec2967-0
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.450
Next we have.

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-0
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:26.270
Piece of luggage like this would
be. Well no, it's it's not like

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-1
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:31.084
a steam truck, a steamship, like
a steamer, you know what I mean?

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-2
01:00:31.084 --> 01:00:35.825
Like a like a chest created for
long steamship journeys. I think

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-3
01:00:35.825 --> 01:00:39.910
that this is just a normal
suitcase packed, packed with

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-4
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:43.849
some items of clothing or
something. And then finally

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-5
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:48.225
we've got a close up picture of
the family. I think this is

ebe0880b-b9c9-4e15-ab1c-41574dc58d0d-6
01:00:48.225 --> 01:00:52.310
probably a close up of the
family photo from before or.

1888a250-b571-4f40-bff1-f3f70f8c1021-0
01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.703
Family picture from before. So
we see the man and the woman and

1888a250-b571-4f40-bff1-f3f70f8c1021-1
01:00:55.703 --> 01:00:56.690
the child in front.

c9cfc189-126f-442c-88b1-1a7ee8f9977e-0
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:04.996
In this next scene, which takes
up a whole page, we see a woman

c9cfc189-126f-442c-88b1-1a7ee8f9977e-1
01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:06.280
and a man at.

1c10c388-889a-4a5e-8deb-a2d948127427-0
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.127
The dining room table or kitchen
table and they both have their

1c10c388-889a-4a5e-8deb-a2d948127427-1
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.290
hands on the the trunk, so.

04de5368-eb7e-4dfe-823d-12f53374506d-0
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:20.484
So it was two different hands.
So they're both looking, they

04de5368-eb7e-4dfe-823d-12f53374506d-1
01:01:20.484 --> 01:01:22.680
they both look very unhappy.

1754b4ec-11d7-400a-83b7-301c09be9fe1-0
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.510
And um.

6d1a35cb-5bdc-4ab4-89e8-fe2324d68ff2-0
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.308
Yeah, I mean there's the the
teapot is there. 2, 2 cups of

6d1a35cb-5bdc-4ab4-89e8-fe2324d68ff2-1
01:01:33.308 --> 01:01:34.450
tea are there.

17a8628d-f6f5-427a-b22f-159937208a6b-0
01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.092
You know, there had been a child
I from what I remember from

17a8628d-f6f5-427a-b22f-159937208a6b-1
01:01:39.092 --> 01:01:41.510
before, but that child's not in
this scene.

9bfb808e-365d-4397-a1c0-b15c3e0376a2-0
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:43.390


53c3a270-bb22-4b12-b32a-d62e91455908-0
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.150
So yeah, the the time on the
clock is 10 after 10.

50e25572-ce4f-4bd5-bdd2-ec73e83a9b5c-0
01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.820
I'll know it in case it makes a
difference later.

c9bca000-3311-46b0-98bc-9021206fe5dd-0
01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:58.233
OK, well, there's the kid. OK,
so in this series of 12 small

c9bca000-3311-46b0-98bc-9021206fe5dd-1
01:01:58.233 --> 01:02:02.977
images, we see the head of a
child underneath some blankets,

c9bca000-3311-46b0-98bc-9021206fe5dd-2
01:02:02.977 --> 01:02:07.721
and we see a little bit more of
her face as she's coming out

c9bca000-3311-46b0-98bc-9021206fe5dd-3
01:02:07.721 --> 01:02:09.510
from under her blanket.

3b52a9fb-807f-4231-b6c9-b05c823098dc-0
01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:14.090
Then she's setting up and
yawning and rubbing one of her

3b52a9fb-807f-4231-b6c9-b05c823098dc-1
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:14.420
eyes.

ab9a7b62-cc8a-4bd4-82f4-a9d55a44912c-0
01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:19.677
Next we see that she's seated at
a table. She's holding a bowl in

ab9a7b62-cc8a-4bd4-82f4-a9d55a44912c-1
01:02:19.677 --> 01:02:23.269
front of her using a spoon.
She's kind of like not looking

ab9a7b62-cc8a-4bd4-82f4-a9d55a44912c-2
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:26.800
at her food. She's looking at
something off to her right.

43c1cf79-a8f3-4a07-b0c6-ec1f48e1c052-0
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:31.718
And now she's looking at
something down to her left. And

43c1cf79-a8f3-4a07-b0c6-ec1f48e1c052-1
01:02:31.718 --> 01:02:36.081
in that scene we just see the
suitcase. So I think that's

43c1cf79-a8f3-4a07-b0c6-ec1f48e1c052-2
01:02:36.081 --> 01:02:40.369
probably what she was looking
at. Then we see the father

43c1cf79-a8f3-4a07-b0c6-ec1f48e1c052-3
01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:45.184
putting his hat on, the mother
putting a scarf around her head,

43c1cf79-a8f3-4a07-b0c6-ec1f48e1c052-4
01:02:45.184 --> 01:02:47.139
and then we see the child.

db34bc4f-cdd0-498a-b8b6-0515a5c2e2ca-0
01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.046
We see hands helping the child
put on a jacket, so maybe you

db34bc4f-cdd0-498a-b8b6-0515a5c2e2ca-1
01:02:53.046 --> 01:02:57.270
know one of the parents is
helping as the child reaches up

db34bc4f-cdd0-498a-b8b6-0515a5c2e2ca-2
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:59.060
to put a hat on her head.

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-0
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.175
In the next scene we see her
putting her boots on and then in

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-1
01:03:05.175 --> 01:03:09.340
the scene after that she's
holding the suitcase up and

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-2
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:14.186
looking upwards. And in the last
scene on this page, we see, we

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-3
01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:18.200
see the father from the
perspective of someone who's

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-4
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.895
like down at his knee level. So
it's like we're looking up at

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-5
01:03:22.895 --> 01:03:27.742
him. So we're getting her like
the child's perspective and he's

e4583153-7512-4287-8577-56ac932b1c22-6
01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:30.089
reaching down so as of to take.

31bea94f-5519-476a-8ce9-0154c69f8379-0
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.680
The suitcase from the child.

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-0
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:36.633
In the next scene we see the
exterior of the building, I

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-1
01:03:36.633 --> 01:03:40.918
guess from which they emerged.
This is like where their home

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-2
01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:45.133
is. So we see the doorway with
the steps leading up to this

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-3
01:03:45.133 --> 01:03:49.629
this building. I mean look, it
looks pretty Spartan. The shadow

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-4
01:03:49.629 --> 01:03:54.054
that's that appears on the side
of this building looks like it

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-5
01:03:54.054 --> 01:03:58.339
came from an enormous creature
with a long dragon like tail.

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-6
01:03:58.339 --> 01:04:02.624
And we see them walking away
from their home with the father

31616a23-a876-4211-bca3-cdd7d9969fdd-7
01:04:02.624 --> 01:04:04.100
holding the suitcase.

52dde1f6-4075-4d37-96f4-5bc0a77491f2-0
01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:07.782
The child in between both
parents and they're very much

52dde1f6-4075-4d37-96f4-5bc0a77491f2-1
01:04:07.782 --> 01:04:10.870
dressed for weather or for like
a long journey.

fe9ea218-3122-488a-bea7-dd153ed65255-0
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:18.696
The next scene is the child who
I I think is looking sad. The

fe9ea218-3122-488a-bea7-dd153ed65255-1
01:04:18.696 --> 01:04:22.630
pixels of the screen is making
it hard to see her eyes, but

fe9ea218-3122-488a-bea7-dd153ed65255-2
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:26.696
she's kind of looking upwards
and then she's looking down and

fe9ea218-3122-488a-bea7-dd153ed65255-3
01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.730
then she's looking to the side.

2f5d9b6b-c35d-49cd-b4b0-952368afff8a-0
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.884
And in the next larger scene, we
see that we get this view of a

2f5d9b6b-c35d-49cd-b4b0-952368afff8a-1
01:04:35.884 --> 01:04:41.073
train station and there's an
old-fashioned locomotive that's

2f5d9b6b-c35d-49cd-b4b0-952368afff8a-2
01:04:41.073 --> 01:04:43.710
coming towards us, the viewers.

275bff14-369f-4301-ad62-e1f37effe8b6-0
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:48.227
And I don't know that we see
this. Oh, I think that this

275bff14-369f-4301-ad62-e1f37effe8b6-1
01:04:48.227 --> 01:04:51.638
family is actually in the middle
of the scene. There's a father

275bff14-369f-4301-ad62-e1f37effe8b6-2
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:55.156
with a suitcase and a mother and
a child in the middle. It's hard

275bff14-369f-4301-ad62-e1f37effe8b6-3
01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:58.141
to see because they're all
silhouetted. Everyone in the

275bff14-369f-4301-ad62-e1f37effe8b6-4
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:00.060
scene is just a silhouette,
really.

eb4ffdb4-b343-4745-bc14-627f91a81238-0
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.330
And then,

84534bb0-82e6-4af5-91e1-eab967d7fe01-0
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:07.184
The last three scenes on this
page is the child looking up and

84534bb0-82e6-4af5-91e1-eab967d7fe01-1
01:05:07.184 --> 01:05:11.206
the father's hand is on the
child's shoulder as she looks up

84534bb0-82e6-4af5-91e1-eab967d7fe01-2
01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:11.470
and.

604dda85-c684-4884-9537-810efc122ace-0
01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:17.088
And then after that we see that
he takes his hat off and he's

604dda85-c684-4884-9537-810efc122ace-1
01:05:17.088 --> 01:05:22.237
bending forward and on his head
that had been, under his hat is

604dda85-c684-4884-9537-810efc122ace-2
01:05:22.237 --> 01:05:27.306
a paper bird. And then he hands
that paper bird to her. In the

604dda85-c684-4884-9537-810efc122ace-3
01:05:27.306 --> 01:05:32.455
final scene on this page that we
just see that his hand and her

604dda85-c684-4884-9537-810efc122ace-4
01:05:32.455 --> 01:05:37.524
hand and the paper bird being
held by both of them at the same

604dda85-c684-4884-9537-810efc122ace-5
01:05:37.524 --> 01:05:42.110
time. Finally on this, the next
page, we see the father.

0b953a1c-8b75-41db-b8d4-38949422ca3c-0
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:46.975
You know, leaning down, putting
his arm gently around the girl

0b953a1c-8b75-41db-b8d4-38949422ca3c-1
01:05:46.975 --> 01:05:51.195
as she's holding the paper bird.
And then he come, like he

0b953a1c-8b75-41db-b8d4-38949422ca3c-2
01:05:51.195 --> 01:05:55.701
reaches in for, you know, like a
big embrace to the child. And

0b953a1c-8b75-41db-b8d4-38949422ca3c-3
01:05:55.701 --> 01:06:00.350
then the child is looking up at
him, holding the paper bird with

0b953a1c-8b75-41db-b8d4-38949422ca3c-4
01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:04.569
a an expression that's kind of
hard to read, I think from.

4c5fabd5-71f0-4535-a50f-565508fe2335-0
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.512
You know, from the media that we
have here on the screen, but I I

4c5fabd5-71f0-4535-a50f-565508fe2335-1
01:06:09.512 --> 01:06:11.020
think that she's looking sad.

c684dbac-596f-437c-965f-5b730065b830-0
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:16.482
The next scenes are of the woman
with the headscarf, who is

c684dbac-596f-437c-965f-5b730065b830-1
01:06:16.482 --> 01:06:21.490
incredibly sad. She's holding up
a a handkerchief to her eyes and

c684dbac-596f-437c-965f-5b730065b830-2
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:26.119
she's crying, and now she's
reaching in for a hug to the man

c684dbac-596f-437c-965f-5b730065b830-3
01:06:26.119 --> 01:06:30.444
with the hat and holding him
with both arms. And then he

c684dbac-596f-437c-965f-5b730065b830-4
01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:35.149
holds. He holds her cheek with
one of his hands as he reaches

c684dbac-596f-437c-965f-5b730065b830-5
01:06:35.149 --> 01:06:39.930
in, I think maybe to give her a
kiss on the side of her cheek.

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-0
01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:45.254
And now he boards the train. So
we see him stepping up onto the

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-1
01:06:45.254 --> 01:06:49.659
train car, and then we see his
hand with both the woman and the

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-2
01:06:49.659 --> 01:06:53.995
child holding onto his hand. And
then in the next scene we see

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-3
01:06:53.995 --> 01:06:58.055
them have to let go. So we see
all their hands again, just

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-4
01:06:58.055 --> 01:07:02.529
they're all disconnected at this
point. And then the final three

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-5
01:07:02.529 --> 01:07:06.865
scenes on that page are just the
train traveling away off into

39ce35c5-000b-4850-a5f3-b7ac407bac49-6
01:07:06.865 --> 01:07:07.760
the distance.

a079a584-f938-4372-b3ad-6cedec1b87d7-0
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:13.290
The next scene we see the
picture of the family.

3fdaee4d-3c07-48af-91e3-d3c11840c189-0
01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:18.944
We got an up close shot of the
picture, then as we back out we

3fdaee4d-3c07-48af-91e3-d3c11840c189-1
01:07:18.944 --> 01:07:20.520
see that the picture is.

4777d834-210f-4f1d-9e04-36b542c9f470-0
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.430
On a ledge.

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-0
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:29.287
You know with some the wall
behind it is riveted. And then

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-1
01:07:29.287 --> 01:07:33.110
we see him eating some soup,
he's holding a bowl and a spoon.

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-2
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:37.055
And then as we back out further
we see that he is sitting, he's

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-3
01:07:37.055 --> 01:07:40.570
eating his dinner and he's
looking at the picture of his

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-4
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:44.454
family. As we pull out more we
see that it's riveted because I

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-5
01:07:44.454 --> 01:07:48.215
think he is in a ship. We we get
a porthole view of him with

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-6
01:07:48.215 --> 01:07:51.975
rivets around the outside of
this round porthole. We see him

f58fa64f-d9e0-491e-9655-a78223597a53-7
01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:55.860
in the center and as we continue
to pull away from this scene.

9df55946-fd18-424e-b11b-5eea890517d5-0
01:07:55.930 --> 01:08:00.050
And get a sort of more distant
view.

7821fa3d-0ce2-4a1c-870a-0217eee93a29-0
01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:07.258
That we see that it's a porthole
of many that are on the side of

7821fa3d-0ce2-4a1c-870a-0217eee93a29-1
01:08:07.258 --> 01:08:12.323
this steamship or ocean liner
that's traveling just OK.

7821fa3d-0ce2-4a1c-870a-0217eee93a29-2
01:08:12.323 --> 01:08:13.590
#END_arrival_1

67bb5820-2746-40e3-9e98-d07605e38d68-0
01:08:27.610 --> 01:08:28.750
Sorry, you're still needed.

518c7b18-4cc7-4d03-a142-0211a980881d-0
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.441
You were muted that whole time,
but if you want, I can just. Oh

518c7b18-4cc7-4d03-a142-0211a980881d-1
01:08:43.441 --> 01:08:47.546
yeah, I was saying, next we have
another story I think you could

518c7b18-4cc7-4d03-a142-0211a980881d-2
01:08:47.546 --> 01:08:48.810
see. Yeah, I got it.

a8026d14-2c95-4371-bd85-4f2e60574b1f-0
01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.037
#START_journey All right, so, so
in this scene we've got like a

a8026d14-2c95-4371-bd85-4f2e60574b1f-1
01:08:59.037 --> 01:09:03.495
sepia town or village. There's
a, you know, there's a couple of

a8026d14-2c95-4371-bd85-4f2e60574b1f-2
01:09:03.495 --> 01:09:07.953
old fashioned town homes that we
can see in the foreground are,

a8026d14-2c95-4371-bd85-4f2e60574b1f-3
01:09:07.953 --> 01:09:11.854
you know, brownstones and in the
background we see some

a8026d14-2c95-4371-bd85-4f2e60574b1f-4
01:09:11.854 --> 01:09:12.690
skyscrapers.

7afc0541-daf1-4fe1-9bab-e31dd407cc43-0
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:19.001
Notably, the only colors really
that go beyond the sepia tones

7afc0541-daf1-4fe1-9bab-e31dd407cc43-1
01:09:19.001 --> 01:09:23.715
are the the crayon that's being
held by one child near a

7afc0541-daf1-4fe1-9bab-e31dd407cc43-2
01:09:23.715 --> 01:09:28.347
mailbox, and it's a purple
crayon, and then one scooter

7afc0541-daf1-4fe1-9bab-e31dd407cc43-3
01:09:28.347 --> 01:09:33.558
that's red that's near the stoop
where another kid is sitting.

7afc0541-daf1-4fe1-9bab-e31dd407cc43-4
01:09:33.558 --> 01:09:38.273
The street light also has two
red symbols that are being

7afc0541-daf1-4fe1-9bab-e31dd407cc43-5
01:09:38.273 --> 01:09:38.770
shown.

9a127f32-7fc6-4973-a72f-bdac6741fd70-0
01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:44.763
And to the right we got a cross
section of an apartment

9a127f32-7fc6-4973-a72f-bdac6741fd70-1
01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:49.940
building, so we only see the
four rooms of this apartment.

845a9fb3-1277-48d8-bcaa-add1ec97e8be-0
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.910
We have an entranceway.

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-0
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.742
That you would enter when you
came up the stoop. To the right

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-1
01:09:57.742 --> 01:10:01.094
of that is a kitchen, and
there's a woman who is standing

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-2
01:10:01.094 --> 01:10:04.735
in front of a stove. We only see
her back, but she's holding a

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-3
01:10:04.735 --> 01:10:07.971
spoon and she's stirring
something in the in a in a pan

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-4
01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:11.496
on top of the stove top. Above
that is a sitting room, and I

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-5
01:10:11.496 --> 01:10:15.136
think we see a kid who's holding
up a device like he's holding

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-6
01:10:15.136 --> 01:10:18.950
something up at about eye level,
and it looks as if there's white

7e1a9a07-56f9-4898-80be-096cc0db124b-7
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.280
light coming out of it.

f9ed3ecd-bc3f-4d2a-902e-0739ccfdb8e8-0
01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:26.545
And then to the left of that, or
in other words, like directly

f9ed3ecd-bc3f-4d2a-902e-0739ccfdb8e8-1
01:10:26.545 --> 01:10:31.457
above the front entrance way is
a study or a library and we see

f9ed3ecd-bc3f-4d2a-902e-0739ccfdb8e8-2
01:10:31.457 --> 01:10:36.369
a man sitting at a computer with
bookcases behind him. So yeah,

f9ed3ecd-bc3f-4d2a-902e-0739ccfdb8e8-3
01:10:36.369 --> 01:10:40.130
that is that is the scene that's
happening here.

a1b309e5-31d7-449e-8f93-a5e5a4f2b534-0
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:45.726
OK, so in the next scene, told
in three parts, we've got the

a1b309e5-31d7-449e-8f93-a5e5a4f2b534-1
01:10:45.726 --> 01:10:49.703
woman who's cooking something on
the stove and she's using an old

a1b309e5-31d7-449e-8f93-a5e5a4f2b534-2
01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:53.138
fashioned corded phone so she
has the the phone receiver

a1b309e5-31d7-449e-8f93-a5e5a4f2b534-3
01:10:53.138 --> 01:10:55.789
tucked under one of her
shoulders as she's.

5ad068cf-b042-4d6c-9666-11c322118323-0
01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.379
Continues to cook something on
the stove top. We see the kid

5ad068cf-b042-4d6c-9666-11c322118323-1
01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:03.582
who has the red scooter over
near part of the kitchen

5ad068cf-b042-4d6c-9666-11c322118323-2
01:11:03.582 --> 01:11:07.320
counter. His scooter is nearby.
It's just kind of like leaning

5ad068cf-b042-4d6c-9666-11c322118323-3
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.160
up against the kitchen drawers.

f8aa7ae1-b760-4d69-9aba-7c4f3a91b2c6-0
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:14.222
Next we see the boy, who's now
dragging a red kite behind him,

f8aa7ae1-b760-4d69-9aba-7c4f3a91b2c6-1
01:11:14.222 --> 01:11:17.848
coming up behind his dad's
office chair. His dad is

f8aa7ae1-b760-4d69-9aba-7c4f3a91b2c6-2
01:11:17.848 --> 01:11:22.380
immersed, has his full attention
on whatever the computer screen

f8aa7ae1-b760-4d69-9aba-7c4f3a91b2c6-3
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.170
is, while the boy looks on from
behind.

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-0
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:30.933
And then we see the boy kind of
come up behind the couch where I

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-1
01:11:30.933 --> 01:11:34.881
think his sister, maybe older
sister, is, you know, like

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-2
01:11:34.881 --> 01:11:39.246
taking up most of the couch just
by kind of lounging on it and

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-3
01:11:39.246 --> 01:11:43.403
she's holding something up to
her face. All of these scenes

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-4
01:11:43.403 --> 01:11:47.767
would tend to apply that this is
like the late 80s, so I don't

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-5
01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:52.132
think it would be a cell phone,
but I'm not sure what it would

728aae5d-8458-487d-b2bb-811c00d68251-6
01:11:52.132 --> 01:11:52.340
be.

a8d70ee6-02c7-48e2-b5f2-afdc4b4324c4-0
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:53.610
Umm.

64f91784-96ec-4283-ad02-3f33363cebc5-0
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:58.698
And so then finally, the next
scene is we see the boy in his

64f91784-96ec-4283-ad02-3f33363cebc5-1
01:11:58.698 --> 01:12:02.739
room and he's just sitting on
his bed. There is no color at

64f91784-96ec-4283-ad02-3f33363cebc5-2
01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:06.847
all in this room, so he's just
on his bed. There's a hot air

64f91784-96ec-4283-ad02-3f33363cebc5-3
01:12:06.847 --> 01:12:11.022
balloon in mobile hanging from
the ceiling. A cat is sleeping

64f91784-96ec-4283-ad02-3f33363cebc5-4
01:12:11.022 --> 01:12:14.928
on the floor. But otherwise,
like there is really nothing

64f91784-96ec-4283-ad02-3f33363cebc5-5
01:12:14.928 --> 01:12:16.680
happening in this bedroom.

6fec17f9-c584-4512-b7ae-6e2ee752b1d7-0
01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.032
In the next scene, it's still
the bedroom scene. He's looking

6fec17f9-c584-4512-b7ae-6e2ee752b1d7-1
01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:25.193
down and he sees a red crayon,
so that was not there before,

6fec17f9-c584-4512-b7ae-6e2ee752b1d7-2
01:12:25.193 --> 01:12:28.146
but also we now see the cat
leaving the room. So I think

6fec17f9-c584-4512-b7ae-6e2ee752b1d7-3
01:12:28.146 --> 01:12:30.530
maybe the cat was sleeping on
the red Crayon.

9d084995-ebc9-43a2-8f91-042a123293ec-0
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.190
So he looks down on it.

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-0
01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:38.947
And then in the next scene, told
in three parts, is we see the

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-1
01:12:38.947 --> 01:12:43.605
boy crouched down reaching for
the red crayon. Next we see him

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-2
01:12:43.605 --> 01:12:48.189
using the red crayon to draw an
archway on the wall, and then

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-3
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:52.773
finally we see him exiting the
room through a doorway that he

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-4
01:12:52.773 --> 01:12:57.283
just created. Next we've got a
forest scene. He emerges from

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-5
01:12:57.283 --> 01:13:02.015
the base of one of these trees
through the doorway that has the

177781ea-c9a5-4d88-bf84-c16daf515b31-6
01:13:02.015 --> 01:13:04.160
arched red door that he drew.

1a06d248-dbbb-4865-8541-a26d9e0b7ddc-0
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:09.578
The the forest is mostly green,
mostly green hues. There are

1a06d248-dbbb-4865-8541-a26d9e0b7ddc-1
01:13:09.578 --> 01:13:13.764
blue lamps like old style
Chinese lamps, kind of like

1a06d248-dbbb-4865-8541-a26d9e0b7ddc-2
01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:18.570
hanging from from the treetops,
and there are stringed lights

1a06d248-dbbb-4865-8541-a26d9e0b7ddc-3
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:23.298
also connecting some of the
trees to give this whole place a

1a06d248-dbbb-4865-8541-a26d9e0b7ddc-4
01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:28.027
sort of enchanted feel. And
there's a stream running through

1a06d248-dbbb-4865-8541-a26d9e0b7ddc-5
01:13:28.027 --> 01:13:28.880
the forest.

fa406379-8dec-4f2b-a569-dfc911218067-0
01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.810
He goes to um.

1de57ee6-c532-471f-81cb-f2f460a75f4e-0
01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:36.287
He goes to like the dock that
kind of juts into the stream a

1de57ee6-c532-471f-81cb-f2f460a75f4e-1
01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:40.631
little bit, and he's standing on
the edge of it and he's looking

1de57ee6-c532-471f-81cb-f2f460a75f4e-2
01:13:40.631 --> 01:13:44.842
down into the stream and he's
still holding the red crayon, so

1de57ee6-c532-471f-81cb-f2f460a75f4e-3
01:13:44.842 --> 01:13:47.849
you kind of see his reflection a
little bit.

6124ed03-7ad5-4920-a091-24076bee993e-0
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:52.770
In the next scene, again it's
sort of done in three parts.

547cef31-c613-4b82-a4fb-c8301cbefa42-0
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:57.365
First he reaches down and he
draws like an ark with his red

547cef31-c613-4b82-a4fb-c8301cbefa42-1
01:13:57.365 --> 01:14:01.410
crayon. Next he finishes up the
drawing a little bit more, so

547cef31-c613-4b82-a4fb-c8301cbefa42-2
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:05.456
you can see that he's started to
draw a boat, and then in the

547cef31-c613-4b82-a4fb-c8301cbefa42-3
01:14:05.456 --> 01:14:09.501
final scene he is in the boat
that he drew. Now it's entirely

547cef31-c613-4b82-a4fb-c8301cbefa42-4
01:14:09.501 --> 01:14:13.612
finished and he is. He starts to
travel down the stream inside

547cef31-c613-4b82-a4fb-c8301cbefa42-5
01:14:13.612 --> 01:14:14.200
the boat.

6f3f13ac-a78c-4f22-8d42-9a4f476c37f5-0
01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.370
Next, the stream.

e445545b-c2b5-4184-bf79-e239f02095a8-0
01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:26.910
That he's on emerge sort of like
comes out to this.

348ab7d1-dd3a-47b7-a8f5-2c28578260ef-0
01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:33.241
Large city. We've seen this a
couple of times, having done

348ab7d1-dd3a-47b7-a8f5-2c28578260ef-1
01:14:33.241 --> 01:14:39.014
this story a few Times now, but
it's the we we see a bird's eye

348ab7d1-dd3a-47b7-a8f5-2c28578260ef-2
01:14:39.014 --> 01:14:44.877
view of this fantasy city, many
like turreted areas. We see some

348ab7d1-dd3a-47b7-a8f5-2c28578260ef-3
01:14:44.877 --> 01:14:50.470
domed towers. Everything is done
in sort of muted green, Gray

348ab7d1-dd3a-47b7-a8f5-2c28578260ef-4
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:54.799
colors. The domes themselves,
though, are gold.

5b91896c-f3d5-4f72-9626-3ead4e5036e1-0
01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:00.991
And the boy who's in the red
boat is approaching the city

5b91896c-f3d5-4f72-9626-3ead4e5036e1-1
01:15:00.991 --> 01:15:06.618
through one of the channels that
leads into the city, across the

5b91896c-f3d5-4f72-9626-3ead4e5036e1-2
01:15:06.618 --> 01:15:07.830
Moat and into.

85ad7749-f2ae-48cf-afe5-54dddb6d9ea4-0
01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.837
The the city streams system. As
he arrives, he's being greeted

85ad7749-f2ae-48cf-afe5-54dddb6d9ea4-1
01:15:13.837 --> 01:15:18.388
by some of the guards. This is
obviously not his first time

85ad7749-f2ae-48cf-afe5-54dddb6d9ea4-2
01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:23.090
into the city. There's a lock
structure that makes it so that

85ad7749-f2ae-48cf-afe5-54dddb6d9ea4-3
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:27.565
when he enters parts of this
aqueduct city it it's evident

85ad7749-f2ae-48cf-afe5-54dddb6d9ea4-4
01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:32.191
that you know the boat itself
has to raise from one level to

85ad7749-f2ae-48cf-afe5-54dddb6d9ea4-5
01:15:32.191 --> 01:15:34.770
another. So it's like a lock
and.

4c01bcb3-db52-4dda-9a28-799adeed68f5-0
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:41.343
What's it called? Well, I'm
forgetting exactly the term, but

4c01bcb3-db52-4dda-9a28-799adeed68f5-1
01:15:41.343 --> 01:15:45.106
they have them in canals, like
in Europe. Anyway. So he enters

4c01bcb3-db52-4dda-9a28-799adeed68f5-2
01:15:45.106 --> 01:15:48.750
this lock system and you know
he's being greeted by everyone

4c01bcb3-db52-4dda-9a28-799adeed68f5-3
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:52.453
nearby. In the distance we can
just like the the tops of some

4c01bcb3-db52-4dda-9a28-799adeed68f5-4
01:15:52.453 --> 01:15:55.380
of the other aqueducts leading
through the city.

c816c739-9f84-4e1b-bad4-452995b067db-0
01:15:57.330 --> 01:16:01.268
In this next scene, the boy is
at the top of one of the

c816c739-9f84-4e1b-bad4-452995b067db-1
01:16:01.268 --> 01:16:05.559
aqueducts, which just kind of
actually ends, and his boat is

c816c739-9f84-4e1b-bad4-452995b067db-2
01:16:05.559 --> 01:16:07.810
about to go down this waterfall.

d1e17939-f252-444d-9dc7-011a5d75b29e-0
01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:12.842
So he's looking over the, the,
the aft, the stern of the boat,

d1e17939-f252-444d-9dc7-011a5d75b29e-1
01:16:12.842 --> 01:16:17.087
and he's looking down and as as
he's falling. I think that in

d1e17939-f252-444d-9dc7-011a5d75b29e-2
01:16:17.087 --> 01:16:21.263
this next scene, which just has
a white background, it looks

d1e17939-f252-444d-9dc7-011a5d75b29e-3
01:16:21.263 --> 01:16:25.507
like he's falling through the
air, but in doing so he also is

d1e17939-f252-444d-9dc7-011a5d75b29e-4
01:16:25.507 --> 01:16:28.520
drawing a large circle with his
red crayon.

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-0
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:34.699
And this next scene is seen from
the air and we see the top of

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-1
01:16:34.699 --> 01:16:38.880
one of the towers nearby. And
the kid is now in a a red hot

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-2
01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.130
air balloon. So he's in the
basket and he's weighing, waving

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-3
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:47.450
down to some of the guards below
who are at the top of one of

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-4
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:51.561
these towers. And he seems
totally fine. In the background

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-5
01:16:51.561 --> 01:16:55.741
there are a couple of airships,
one of them is particularly

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-6
01:16:55.741 --> 01:16:59.573
large. It looks like a, you
know, just kind of a large

369686ec-257d-42d2-bad3-d476dfaaa43d-7
01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:00.410
paddle boat.

042d629a-6fe7-4786-893e-5490e35b6bb6-0
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:05.865
With elements of airships in it,
but it's very clearly up in the

042d629a-6fe7-4786-893e-5490e35b6bb6-1
01:17:05.865 --> 01:17:09.246
clouds with some of the other
more traditional looking

042d629a-6fe7-4786-893e-5490e35b6bb6-2
01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:09.800
airships.

3f00ceec-e918-49a1-9935-379c59d3bb88-0
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:17.101
As he is looking down below, he
sees one of the airships with

3f00ceec-e918-49a1-9935-379c59d3bb88-1
01:17:17.101 --> 01:17:22.070
the guard with the horned hat or
the horned helmet and.

794e1fdf-0337-40dc-99ab-5705c833e668-0
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:26.747
On the ship with him is the
golden cage and a couple of

794e1fdf-0337-40dc-99ab-5705c833e668-1
01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:30.659
other guards. Two of them are
holding the feet of a third

794e1fdf-0337-40dc-99ab-5705c833e668-2
01:17:30.659 --> 01:17:34.773
guard who has a net in one hand,
and he is reaching over the

794e1fdf-0337-40dc-99ab-5705c833e668-3
01:17:34.773 --> 01:17:38.685
airship itself, sort of like
lunging into the air as he's

794e1fdf-0337-40dc-99ab-5705c833e668-4
01:17:38.685 --> 01:17:42.800
trying to catch the purple bird
which is also flying nearby.

e78a7815-6fda-4019-a72d-885613860400-0
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:51.455
Then we see the red hot air
balloon approaching the main

e78a7815-6fda-4019-a72d-885613860400-1
01:17:51.455 --> 01:17:56.529
airship, the one with the paddle
structure below. And on that

e78a7815-6fda-4019-a72d-885613860400-2
01:17:56.529 --> 01:18:01.440
ship we now see that the guard
with the horned helmet is on

e78a7815-6fda-4019-a72d-885613860400-3
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.778
that ship. And it looks like he
and his other guards

e78a7815-6fda-4019-a72d-885613860400-4
01:18:05.778 --> 01:18:10.852
successfully caught the bird.
Because I think in the distance

e78a7815-6fda-4019-a72d-885613860400-5
01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:15.600
we can kind of see the outline
of a golden bird cage and 

7d9f3b41-34a0-4e62-867e-5a535dec9af8-0
01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.701
inside of it is a purple bird
who has a really long purple

7d9f3b41-34a0-4e62-867e-5a535dec9af8-1
01:18:18.701 --> 01:18:21.550
tail that's kind of coming out
the bottom of this cage.

6f12004e-9e31-4072-9540-33aafcf5bd60-0
01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:25.710
Um.

cfa28065-27b0-442f-9cac-65ccac150bdc-0
01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:32.856
The boy now has landed on top of
one of the rear platforms of the

cfa28065-27b0-442f-9cac-65ccac150bdc-1
01:18:32.856 --> 01:18:38.680
ship and we see him sort of like
racing towards one of the open

cfa28065-27b0-442f-9cac-65ccac150bdc-2
01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.232
doorways and one of the shafts
of the the ship. Up above, we

cfa28065-27b0-442f-9cac-65ccac150bdc-3
01:18:44.232 --> 01:18:49.510
see that the two, these two
turrets, these two towers are

cfa28065-27b0-442f-9cac-65ccac150bdc-4
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:55.425
connected by a small footbridge
and that's where the bird in the

cfa28065-27b0-442f-9cac-65ccac150bdc-5
01:18:55.425 --> 01:18:56.700
cage is being.

f881fa67-3c84-4925-a0ed-6b391c0a5354-0
01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:02.553
Carried by two guards in the
cage, sort of like in a like

f881fa67-3c84-4925-a0ed-6b391c0a5354-1
01:19:02.553 --> 01:19:04.930
they're holding a a rod.

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-0
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:10.385
And the cage is suspended from
that rod and the guard with the

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-1
01:19:10.385 --> 01:19:15.002
horn helmet is holding the door
open for for the, you know, like

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-2
01:19:15.002 --> 01:19:19.264
the guards with the bird to
proceed through the 2nd opening

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-3
01:19:19.264 --> 01:19:23.668
and the next page, well there
was like some kind of, yeah. So

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-4
01:19:23.668 --> 01:19:27.929
we see this pagoda structure,
you know, it's just it's very

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-5
01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:32.049
fancy and it's bright golden.
The two guards are standing

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-6
01:19:32.049 --> 01:19:36.524
watch over this bird, which is
now being kept in the middle of

a7d07f2b-fb9a-4a48-999d-e84ed382fff6-7
01:19:36.524 --> 01:19:36.880
this.

838d0bee-1c58-4c2b-bb7e-e2014292f792-0
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.650
Pagoda was like.

34e630e8-0e39-4d09-9c45-c680bf2f2b2c-0
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:43.080
Just has like a giant gold
dragon statue at the top of it.

3da09e99-e32b-4c62-811c-274cd435fa71-0
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:49.364
In the next scene, the boy
snatches the cage and is

3da09e99-e32b-4c62-811c-274cd435fa71-1
01:19:49.364 --> 01:19:54.527
starting to run away as the two
guards look shocked to see that

3da09e99-e32b-4c62-811c-274cd435fa71-2
01:19:54.527 --> 01:19:59.367
this has happened. One of them
even loses hold of his spear

3da09e99-e32b-4c62-811c-274cd435fa71-3
01:19:59.367 --> 01:20:04.450
while the other one has his hand
up in a no stop halt gesture.

c1ba39b9-7a52-4c66-81ad-07cab9bfd43f-0
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:10.120
In the next scene we see that
the boy has run down to.

12324104-5ad2-448e-8389-0c1f67ba4f2b-0
01:20:11.530 --> 01:20:15.805
Part of the ship that juts out
from the rear, I believe. And

12324104-5ad2-448e-8389-0c1f67ba4f2b-1
01:20:15.805 --> 01:20:19.380
no, actually, maybe this is the
front of the ship.

5020cf65-5a2c-4f55-b763-1c78edc2ed4f-0
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:24.702
Guards are chasing after him and
all he has done is open the cage

5020cf65-5a2c-4f55-b763-1c78edc2ed4f-1
01:20:24.702 --> 01:20:28.698
and allow the bird to escape.
The red crayon is nearby, so he

5020cf65-5a2c-4f55-b763-1c78edc2ed4f-2
01:20:28.698 --> 01:20:31.919
I don't think he's even holding
it at this point.

82d1b5aa-b2d4-4ef2-a399-680b6a84880c-0
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:37.818
Now the guards have taken hold
of the boy who is reaching

82d1b5aa-b2d4-4ef2-a399-680b6a84880c-1
01:20:37.818 --> 01:20:42.087
desperately outwards because we
see that the guy with the horned

82d1b5aa-b2d4-4ef2-a399-680b6a84880c-2
01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:46.224
helmet has taken the red crayon
and has just dropped it off of

82d1b5aa-b2d4-4ef2-a399-680b6a84880c-3
01:20:46.224 --> 01:20:50.032
the side of the airship. So it
the red crayon is just now

82d1b5aa-b2d4-4ef2-a399-680b6a84880c-4
01:20:50.032 --> 01:20:51.740
falling towards the earth.

c38454a0-6d3b-4089-8f6f-0be2a819e8af-0
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:57.655
And in the next scene, we see
that the boy is now the one

c38454a0-6d3b-4089-8f6f-0be2a819e8af-1
01:20:57.655 --> 01:21:02.894
who's trapped in a cage. He is
being hoisted down below the

c38454a0-6d3b-4089-8f6f-0be2a819e8af-2
01:21:02.894 --> 01:21:05.340
back of rudder the the back.

a437bfaa-90d3-4036-a463-90766901ca70-0
01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600
The back of the ship.

2d0bc14e-3105-4bf4-8981-c84ba7694653-0
01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.826
You know, we we see a couple of
the guards that are using like a

2d0bc14e-3105-4bf4-8981-c84ba7694653-1
01:21:15.826 --> 01:21:18.220
winch system up above and the
boy.

3ac24855-0b4f-494a-909d-232317dc0e15-0
01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:22.786
In the cage is kind of like
looking down below, back down

3ac24855-0b4f-494a-909d-232317dc0e15-1
01:21:22.786 --> 01:21:23.980
towards the Earth.

4e0f455b-581f-480d-87c3-d49cc3ecfe03-0
01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.037
Now we see just an image of the
cage itself, with the boy

4e0f455b-581f-480d-87c3-d49cc3ecfe03-1
01:21:30.037 --> 01:21:34.466
jumping for joy as the purple
bird returns with the red crayon

4e0f455b-581f-480d-87c3-d49cc3ecfe03-2
01:21:34.466 --> 01:21:35.310
in its beak.

1cc5e6fb-20eb-4bde-9c25-521a16470034-0
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:41.441
And then in the next scene, told
in three scenes, we see the boy

1cc5e6fb-20eb-4bde-9c25-521a16470034-1
01:21:41.441 --> 01:21:45.965
using the red crayon down below
to draw first a single line,

1cc5e6fb-20eb-4bde-9c25-521a16470034-2
01:21:45.965 --> 01:21:50.712
then a right angle with another
line nearby. Then it looks like

1cc5e6fb-20eb-4bde-9c25-521a16470034-3
01:21:50.712 --> 01:21:54.570
he's completing a rectangle as
the bird watches on.

67aeea0a-0275-4dee-af81-9348eab83c58-0
01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:00.830
So now we see a bird's eye view
of the scene.

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-0
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:07.856
We see the the empty cage on the
left. We see the boy flying away

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-1
01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:12.889
on a magic carpet or flying
carpet that he created with the

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-2
01:22:12.889 --> 01:22:18.090
bird flying in front of him.
Down below, it looks like a sort

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-3
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:22.536
of a Middle Eastern town.
There's like, there's palm

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-4
01:22:22.536 --> 01:22:27.402
trees, there's like a minaret
nearby, and we've got other

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-5
01:22:27.402 --> 01:22:32.435
buildings, like one of them in
the background kind of looks

ad5d1dc0-b974-4958-9625-d18abe68000f-6
01:22:32.435 --> 01:22:33.610
like a mosque.

df4cf4d2-039a-41b2-9227-88fc7cf97693-0
01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:38.322
With its own like minarets and
domed ceilings. I think down

df4cf4d2-039a-41b2-9227-88fc7cf97693-1
01:22:38.322 --> 01:22:42.838
below there's something that
represents a camel. But yeah,

df4cf4d2-039a-41b2-9227-88fc7cf97693-2
01:22:42.838 --> 01:22:47.660
everything has this kind of like
orange, hazy, warm quality to

df4cf4d2-039a-41b2-9227-88fc7cf97693-3
01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:47.890
it.

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-0
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.719
So now it's night time. The
scene is mostly told in sort of

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-1
01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:59.321
Blues and purples, but so he's
leaving this Middle Eastern

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-2
01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:03.845
village or city to the all we
see is it of it is like a a

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-3
01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:08.524
tower, like a minaret to the
left. The boy is flying on the

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-4
01:23:08.524 --> 01:23:12.970
magic carpet towards the
distance. The bird continues to

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-5
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:18.040
sort of lead the way and in the
background we see the start of a

e4a998f9-2c9d-4ee9-91ee-12e16bcbf60a-6
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.209
mountain range.

e61b6ccc-0ba1-4dba-bd3c-30ebd7a54279-0
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:27.156
All right, so the boy has
landed. There's pretty much

e61b6ccc-0ba1-4dba-bd3c-30ebd7a54279-1
01:23:27.156 --> 01:23:31.851
just, it's a very simple scene.
The flying carpet is on the

e61b6ccc-0ba1-4dba-bd3c-30ebd7a54279-2
01:23:31.851 --> 01:23:36.547
ground, the boy holds his red
crayon. At the base of a very

e61b6ccc-0ba1-4dba-bd3c-30ebd7a54279-3
01:23:36.547 --> 01:23:41.634
thin palm tree is a small purple
door, and the the bird waits on

e61b6ccc-0ba1-4dba-bd3c-30ebd7a54279-4
01:23:41.634 --> 01:23:43.200
a small rock nearby.

b7763f41-a3c4-47ed-a161-e78f54b9b368-0
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:47.603
The next scene, told in three
parts, is the boy crouching

b7763f41-a3c4-47ed-a161-e78f54b9b368-1
01:23:47.603 --> 01:23:51.549
over, reaching towards the door
with his hand on the knob, and

b7763f41-a3c4-47ed-a161-e78f54b9b368-2
01:23:51.549 --> 01:23:54.179
then next we have him with the
door open.

fcee447e-2fec-4d47-8f9e-15954aa26ab6-0
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:58.816
And all we see from the other
side of the door is just white,

fcee447e-2fec-4d47-8f9e-15954aa26ab6-1
01:23:58.816 --> 01:24:02.502
white light, I guess. The bird
starts to fly in the door, and

fcee447e-2fec-4d47-8f9e-15954aa26ab6-2
01:24:02.502 --> 01:24:06.366
then finally in that last scene,
we see the boy crawling through

fcee447e-2fec-4d47-8f9e-15954aa26ab6-3
01:24:06.366 --> 01:24:07.080
the doorway.

6f20b3e8-c6bf-4ceb-9d4a-eb3f1e120b87-0
01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:08.630
OK.

98e5fe7e-c265-4066-9df5-7852c175aff3-0
01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:14.163
Next we're in the city. The
village again, so sepia tones.

98e5fe7e-c265-4066-9df5-7852c175aff3-1
01:24:14.163 --> 01:24:19.026
The boy with the red crayon
crawls out of the front of the

98e5fe7e-c265-4066-9df5-7852c175aff3-2
01:24:19.026 --> 01:24:24.384
mailbox, and the bird is flying
towards the open arms of the boy

98e5fe7e-c265-4066-9df5-7852c175aff3-3
01:24:24.384 --> 01:24:26.609
with the purple crayon. So.

a6d32a9b-e103-4846-b0b0-0ae0e4d6b677-0
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.450
Seems like in the scene they
were reunited.

00592681-ed0b-4d5b-a47b-f9888639d3df-0
01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.816
The next scene, told in three
parts, is the boy with the

00592681-ed0b-4d5b-a47b-f9888639d3df-1
01:24:33.816 --> 01:24:37.836
purple Crayon, helping the boy
with the red Crayon stand up as

00592681-ed0b-4d5b-a47b-f9888639d3df-2
01:24:37.836 --> 01:24:41.792
he looks on to you know, his
bird companion that he's holding

00592681-ed0b-4d5b-a47b-f9888639d3df-3
01:24:41.792 --> 01:24:43.259
up with his other hand.

976b94aa-529b-4cf5-af8e-84d39bd6e7a3-0
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:47.533
The boy with the red Crayon
draws a circle in the next

976b94aa-529b-4cf5-af8e-84d39bd6e7a3-1
01:24:47.533 --> 01:24:51.050
scene, and then finally the boy
with the purple Crayon also

976b94aa-529b-4cf5-af8e-84d39bd6e7a3-2
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:52.340
draws a purple circle.

b2bf4a71-ebd3-46e3-ba3d-01cbceef1431-0
01:24:55.450 --> 01:25:00.146
And then finally, we see the
boys complete their combined

b2bf4a71-ebd3-46e3-ba3d-01cbceef1431-1
01:25:00.146 --> 01:25:04.681
work of this bicycle, which
they're now riding down the

b2bf4a71-ebd3-46e3-ba3d-01cbceef1431-2
01:25:04.681 --> 01:25:09.378
street with the purple bird
following flying behind them.

b2bf4a71-ebd3-46e3-ba3d-01cbceef1431-3
01:25:09.378 --> 01:25:10.349
#END_journey

11782ece-00a7-4fe3-a11c-687e930697fd-0
01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.890
I think you're trying to talk,
but you're muted.

85529483-e644-4c3b-aaf1-bb1cfd3f884c-0
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.690
We just have two.

f02ee74b-f8cd-45ba-894b-ac3482e4475c-0
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.704
Scenes and then one short story
left the short story like really

f02ee74b-f8cd-45ba-894b-ac3482e4475c-1
01:25:36.704 --> 01:25:39.030
short, though I think it's like.

84a6394e-cf32-4f9a-9ce8-ec334dd80983-0
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:44.070
Like 5 slides like it's not like
this one was long.

04303a8e-9126-4d9a-b6b8-bab6213d0e80-0
01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.640
OK, we'll see if we can do it in
20 minutes.

03512b0a-36b5-4dd4-bb8a-bfd00a2bcda7-0
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:52.190
Should be able to.

3ec1ccda-5cb1-4f02-8946-19159b1e2527-0
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:56.590
So let me just pull up the next
short.

360b1a68-9149-48df-8b27-d3843403257f-0
01:25:58.090 --> 01:26:01.070
Vaccine, and it is.

2f6aa5c0-b8ad-456d-9074-ffaf983a9fe7-0
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:10.010
OK, here's this team and I'm
going to just make it.

ed5538a4-2d8b-4d81-a282-936e70794b88-0
01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:15.420
Bigger just like 3/3 to 4
minutes to describe it.

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-0
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.824
#START_exhibit_12 All right, so
the scene, which is like

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-1
01:26:20.824 --> 01:26:25.071
primarily red for the walls in
this building, plus all of the

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-2
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:29.044
colors that are being used to
represent all the people in

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-3
01:26:29.044 --> 01:26:33.497
here, represents a scene of the
interior of some kind of museum,

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-4
01:26:33.497 --> 01:26:37.333
perhaps. The caption in the
upper left hand corner says

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-5
01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:41.580
Exhibit 12, the Great Portrait
exhibit. So I think we're sort

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-6
01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.964
of like in a a Portrait Gallery.
The scene takes place over. It

3e3e6eb5-e50d-4646-9269-6d6c4b6e1d48-7
01:26:45.964 --> 01:26:47.540
looks like 3 different.

2f97046e-05b0-4615-815c-2a30dc724836-0
01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:51.557
Levels, so we've got like the
the the ground floor level and

2f97046e-05b0-4615-815c-2a30dc724836-1
01:26:51.557 --> 01:26:55.764
then you can go up a stairway to
the second level, which kind of

2f97046e-05b0-4615-815c-2a30dc724836-2
01:26:55.764 --> 01:26:56.670
has a balcony.

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-0
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:02.934
You know, where you can look
down to the main level and then

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-1
01:27:02.934 --> 01:27:06.807
from the second level towards
the background you can see

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-2
01:27:06.807 --> 01:27:10.951
there's yet another staircase
going up to yet another level.

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-3
01:27:10.951 --> 01:27:14.756
And that's where a lot of
additional like portraits and

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-4
01:27:14.756 --> 01:27:19.036
people are. So starting on the
ground level, there are so many

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-5
01:27:19.036 --> 01:27:23.045
people just generally in this
scene that you cannot really

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-6
01:27:23.045 --> 01:27:27.257
even see the floor. I mean, you
can see it here and there and

28f75291-dea8-412e-a5d7-f95e9cfa3fb2-7
01:27:27.257 --> 01:27:29.160
you can see that it's white.

e7cf00e8-26a8-436e-81f5-8ba528ba6139-0
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:34.475
But you know, just to give, you
know, just to give the

e7cf00e8-26a8-436e-81f5-8ba528ba6139-1
01:27:34.475 --> 01:27:38.730
impression of, you know, exactly
how many people are here.

798aea8c-c222-472d-af18-8a1c0b653a41-0
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.600
It's, um, it's a lot.

113f2a7a-1f96-4e2d-9826-3ba7a7feb8a5-0
01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.180
Uh, so there's.

1a9c3981-7402-4ab2-8ff3-18863c443c8a-0
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:47.130
Umm.

438b2ae6-64a9-43dc-b642-4ed4f6dee6ed-0
01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:53.297
I'm just trying to get a sense
of like the kinds of people in

438b2ae6-64a9-43dc-b642-4ed4f6dee6ed-1
01:27:53.297 --> 01:27:58.213
this scene. And so once again,
there really doesn't seem to be

438b2ae6-64a9-43dc-b642-4ed4f6dee6ed-2
01:27:58.213 --> 01:28:03.129
an overall theme of how people
are dressed or or who they are.

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-0
01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:08.321
There's no indication that
there's any kind of like rhyme

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-1
01:28:08.321 --> 01:28:13.004
or reason to any of this. So
just to give an example, maybe 3

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-2
01:28:13.004 --> 01:28:17.386
examples on each floor. All
right. So in the first floor,

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-3
01:28:17.386 --> 01:28:21.994
there's a woman who's sitting
on, you know, like on a stool,

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-4
01:28:21.994 --> 01:28:26.526
and she has a an easel and a
canvas in front of her and she

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-5
01:28:26.526 --> 01:28:31.059
is actively painting something.
Meanwhile, there's somebody

d1805f1f-846c-4923-9f40-d31753484447-6
01:28:31.059 --> 01:28:33.930
who's drawing something on the
floor.

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-0
01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:38.543
Um, but it's not just artists,
you know, there are other people

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-1
01:28:38.543 --> 01:28:42.857
here as well. There's somebody
dressed like a medieval knight

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-2
01:28:42.857 --> 01:28:47.311
with like a a hood covering his
head and he's holding some kind

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-3
01:28:47.311 --> 01:28:51.486
of rod. I mean, whether it's a
weapon or not, it's actually

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-4
01:28:51.486 --> 01:28:55.869
hard to say. Oh, actually, no.
OK. So I think he's on skis. So

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-5
01:28:55.869 --> 01:29:00.184
he actually has something in
both hands and it looks like ski

d5c9eaf9-2d17-4997-979e-34ff15010a71-6
01:29:00.184 --> 01:29:04.219
poles, right. OK, towards the
background there's on this.

f36d346a-1043-4ad1-99be-455829faf7ab-0
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.247
Same level. It appears like
there's some kind of like a

f36d346a-1043-4ad1-99be-455829faf7ab-1
01:29:08.247 --> 01:29:12.735
doorway. And there are guards,
you know, just trying their best

f36d346a-1043-4ad1-99be-455829faf7ab-2
01:29:12.735 --> 01:29:16.943
to hold back the crowds, you
know, it's hard to say exactly

f36d346a-1043-4ad1-99be-455829faf7ab-3
01:29:16.943 --> 01:29:21.222
what's happening, but they're
all crowded together, throwing

f36d346a-1043-4ad1-99be-455829faf7ab-4
01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:25.430
their arms up, and they're all
wearing blue with blue hats.

5b235414-7db1-44de-a198-7a37487599ae-0
01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:31.729
On the second level, there's
also a lot of activities going

5b235414-7db1-44de-a198-7a37487599ae-1
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:36.472
on, but there are like alien
creatures, like green, you know,

5b235414-7db1-44de-a198-7a37487599ae-2
01:29:36.472 --> 01:29:40.450
they look like people, but
they're green with like.

3a4abb53-06ed-45f9-930d-034ad318b9fa-0
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:46.374
Two toed feet and like no
clothes. And I think they have

3a4abb53-06ed-45f9-930d-034ad318b9fa-1
01:29:46.374 --> 01:29:47.180
antennas.

c85a1406-f2ab-4510-97a1-95e7e7ada788-0
01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:52.366
So there's a couple of those
guys around and then in the top

c85a1406-f2ab-4510-97a1-95e7e7ada788-1
01:29:52.366 --> 01:29:57.069
level, it's kind of like hard to
see each of these levels has red

c85a1406-f2ab-4510-97a1-95e7e7ada788-2
01:29:57.069 --> 01:29:58.210
walls with just.

b35f72b6-5dda-409a-93e6-e23d2c895fc4-0
01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:04.621
Portraits of different things,
you know, one guy looks like a

b35f72b6-5dda-409a-93e6-e23d2c895fc4-1
01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:09.800
Pilgrim, one, one is of a clown,
one is of a couple, one is

b35f72b6-5dda-409a-93e6-e23d2c895fc4-2
01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:15.237
wearing a blue suit. So yeah,
just generally this is a gallery

b35f72b6-5dda-409a-93e6-e23d2c895fc4-3
01:30:15.237 --> 01:30:17.999
picture with hundreds of people.

a8231a11-95c0-4771-b019-1b6a78d5b53a-0
01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:22.926
Crowded around and no real rhyme
or reason to like what's

a8231a11-95c0-4771-b019-1b6a78d5b53a-1
01:30:22.926 --> 01:30:25.400
happening. #END_exhibit_12 OK,
perfect.

c0038efe-9505-4c19-a4eb-9da56986652f-0
01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:31.879
See next I believe. Yep, it's
another short, but it's another

c0038efe-9505-4c19-a4eb-9da56986652f-1
01:30:31.879 --> 01:30:32.420
scene.

77fedcf2-36a7-42c7-a035-bc33315be5e4-0
01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.450
And then it's.

c242dc15-e3f4-4c97-b91c-ff7f53bdc9a1-0
01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.900
This one.

5e46a2b8-9d2c-4507-84ef-d40212ac5239-0
01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:46.677
OK. And then you could start
when you're ready. I'm just

5e46a2b8-9d2c-4507-84ef-d40212ac5239-1
01:30:46.677 --> 01:30:48.370
going to make sure, yeah.

c398663f-fa1f-46dc-9af4-9dcf46eda3d7-0
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:51.190
OK.

45392cac-f278-462e-bb79-415ace22c55b-0
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.492
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
So this scene is distinguished

45392cac-f278-462e-bb79-415ace22c55b-1
01:30:56.492 --> 01:30:56.870
by like.

59a409a7-9099-4395-abd3-a3eaef544b0e-0
01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:03.486
3-4 like 5 distinct areas of
stuff that's happening. The

59a409a7-9099-4395-abd3-a3eaef544b0e-1
01:31:03.486 --> 01:31:05.880
caption or the like. The.

c652fb1d-e853-47c9-8e31-cbaf3eb03179-0
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:08.480
Yeah, that.

4d8392d3-c2ed-42c0-b206-a01cf0cec5cf-0
01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:13.447
The description of this page is
up in the upper left and it

4d8392d3-c2ed-42c0-b206-a01cf0cec5cf-1
01:31:13.447 --> 01:31:13.680
says.

b3a0e6dc-3dd2-4df6-a05e-df2f45c27b27-0
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:19.437
Dinosaurs, spacemen and ghouls,
and it looks like, um, you know,

b3a0e6dc-3dd2-4df6-a05e-df2f45c27b27-1
01:31:19.437 --> 01:31:24.475
like a Clapper that they use for
the movie industry. So I think

b3a0e6dc-3dd2-4df6-a05e-df2f45c27b27-2
01:31:24.475 --> 01:31:29.120
that what we're looking at are
different stages on a sound

b3a0e6dc-3dd2-4df6-a05e-df2f45c27b27-3
01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.380
stage or like a.

049c275e-1a0e-4951-af30-d2381b1428c9-0
01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.124
You know, like different sets
that they would use for the

049c275e-1a0e-4951-af30-d2381b1428c9-1
01:31:35.124 --> 01:31:35.840
movie industry.

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-0
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:41.605
So I'll just kind of go through
each set. At the bottom, left

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-1
01:31:41.605 --> 01:31:46.127
hand one looks like it is like a
green room or a ready room.

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-2
01:31:46.127 --> 01:31:50.797
There's a three different booths
that you can go into and each

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-3
01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:55.170
one has a star on the door. So
it's like this is where you

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-4
01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:59.469
know, you know different people
who are starring in these

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-5
01:31:59.469 --> 01:32:03.769
different things can go and get
ready in their own space.

cab7b542-3e1e-45eb-9f68-3f3ab22bde4f-6
01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:06.660
There's also like mirrors with
lights.

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-0
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:11.370
Above it. And people kind of
like getting their hair done and

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-1
01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:15.785
makeup done in this particular
area. In the bottom middle,

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-2
01:32:15.785 --> 01:32:20.575
there seems to be a sort of like
haunted scene with like a tree

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-3
01:32:20.575 --> 01:32:24.915
that looks like it has this
horrible, you know, like evil

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-4
01:32:24.915 --> 01:32:28.882
face to it. There are some
Gothic windows, you know,

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-5
01:32:28.882 --> 01:32:33.597
denoting some kind of like evil
looking building, you know, in

f46828df-8549-4461-a6cf-7804d307e481-6
01:32:33.597 --> 01:32:36.890
the background there's lightning
happening.

9c738fe5-908b-4b2a-a3a9-276c959a6962-0
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:42.225
Nearby. And then in this set,
there's some monsters that we

9c738fe5-908b-4b2a-a3a9-276c959a6962-1
01:32:42.225 --> 01:32:46.979
see, you know, like a werewolf
and a mummy and a swamp thing

9c738fe5-908b-4b2a-a3a9-276c959a6962-2
01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:51.187
and lights and cameras
definitely shooting, you know,

9c738fe5-908b-4b2a-a3a9-276c959a6962-3
01:32:51.187 --> 01:32:53.370
throughout that whole scene.

9444716d-7f27-4046-abdd-5abfc539d90a-0
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:58.441
In the bottom right hand area
there is. I think it's sort of

9444716d-7f27-4046-abdd-5abfc539d90a-1
01:32:58.441 --> 01:33:02.473
like an eating area. Like, I
don't think that this is a set.

9444716d-7f27-4046-abdd-5abfc539d90a-2
01:33:02.473 --> 01:33:06.438
I think that this might just be
the cafeteria for the sound

9444716d-7f27-4046-abdd-5abfc539d90a-3
01:33:06.438 --> 01:33:10.140
stage because there's no cameras
or lights or anything.

56ca8101-0db8-4d28-9313-169c87c4f82f-0
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:16.688
you know, filming in this area,
it's just a bunch of tables and

56ca8101-0db8-4d28-9313-169c87c4f82f-1
01:33:16.688 --> 01:33:21.388
chairs and a cafeteria style
setup with a cash register on

56ca8101-0db8-4d28-9313-169c87c4f82f-2
01:33:21.388 --> 01:33:26.247
one side. So it's just like a
lot of people getting food and

56ca8101-0db8-4d28-9313-169c87c4f82f-3
01:33:26.247 --> 01:33:31.186
eating. In the back, the main
scene that takes up most of the

56ca8101-0db8-4d28-9313-169c87c4f82f-4
01:33:31.186 --> 01:33:35.170
space in the middle is this kind
of like a space.

435f654f-cd7e-488f-bec8-a94858740d41-0
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:42.624
Space set. So it looks to be the
surface of some kind of planet.

435f654f-cd7e-488f-bec8-a94858740d41-1
01:33:42.624 --> 01:33:48.237
There are green space guys all
around. A shuttle like a space

435f654f-cd7e-488f-bec8-a94858740d41-2
01:33:48.237 --> 01:33:54.030
rocket or something had landed
upside down onto this, you know,

435f654f-cd7e-488f-bec8-a94858740d41-3
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:59.371
alien planet. And there are
human astronauts, kind of like

435f654f-cd7e-488f-bec8-a94858740d41-4
01:33:59.371 --> 01:34:04.713
reaching out from the windows
and green spaceman and those

435f654f-cd7e-488f-bec8-a94858740d41-5
01:34:04.713 --> 01:34:05.890
like classic.

d92be5fb-e9dc-41da-828a-17e81d816d71-0
01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:10.810
Sci-fi disk spaceships floating
nearby.

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-0
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:17.043
And then in the left, there is a
sort of a volcano scene with

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-1
01:34:17.043 --> 01:34:21.179
like just dozens of people
dressed up like cliched Cavemen,

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-2
01:34:21.179 --> 01:34:25.522
you know, like with the togas,
except they're made with animal

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-3
01:34:25.522 --> 01:34:29.520
hides. And in this scene there
are probably about 7 or so

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-4
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.311
different dinosaurs of various
colors. So it's caveman

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-5
01:34:33.311 --> 01:34:37.585
interacting with dinosaurs in
that scene up and down the side

a5448ffd-6317-4222-9705-8e5b9ff88bfd-6
01:34:37.585 --> 01:34:41.169
of this volcano.

30981fbb-3407-4eb3-baf4-1adb7fdc96d0-0
01:34:43.230 --> 01:34:45.540
Perfect. And now we have our
last.

a7180375-8c1f-4b50-ada5-07e9bc644900-0
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:51.670
Saying which is a short story.
I'm going to just pull it up

a7180375-8c1f-4b50-ada5-07e9bc644900-1
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:52.930
really quickly.

380aad69-f7ef-42a7-be01-ca7e1426ca9a-0
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.830
OK, this is a story with three
slides.

2ef8840c-8b95-4f51-82c8-de6b187bcdbc-0
01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:02.930
OK.

b2cb4404-ae34-42a0-bcd0-e7bb32e93cef-0
01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.050
And I'll share it.

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-0
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:11.050
And I'll present. OK. So just
tell me when you want me to move

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-1
01:35:11.050 --> 01:35:15.311
on from each slide, OK, sure.
Alright. #START_arrival_2 So

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-2
01:35:15.311 --> 01:35:19.861
this first set of scenes is 12
small images. First we see sort

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-3
01:35:19.861 --> 01:35:24.266
of like some people huddled
together, probably women, their,

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-4
01:35:24.266 --> 01:35:29.033
their heads are covered in white
shawls and they're just kind of,

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-5
01:35:29.033 --> 01:35:33.583
yeah, they're just sitting on a
bench huddle together. Next we

99fb8981-5d23-431f-ba5a-b432a1ef2b9b-6
01:35:33.583 --> 01:35:36.400
see three men also sitting on a
bench.

5cfdcc72-3d9a-453b-a32d-0d5a828c5b82-0
01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:40.760
All just kind of like leaning
forward, their hands clasped

5cfdcc72-3d9a-453b-a32d-0d5a828c5b82-1
01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:45.175
together. In the next scene we
see a woman holding a bundle.

5cfdcc72-3d9a-453b-a32d-0d5a828c5b82-2
01:35:45.175 --> 01:35:49.446
It's likely a a a baby, like
maybe a child with a man in a

5cfdcc72-3d9a-453b-a32d-0d5a828c5b82-3
01:35:49.446 --> 01:35:53.499
hat. Just kind of like in the
background of that scene.

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-0
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:58.220
Then we see the man with the
hat, who I think is the

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-1
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:02.263
protagonist of this story,
sitting on his suitcase, kind of

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-2
01:36:02.263 --> 01:36:06.306
leaning forward with a journal
on his leg, and he's writing

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-3
01:36:06.306 --> 01:36:10.550
something in it. The next scene
is a bit more of a close up of

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-4
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:14.458
him writing in the journal.
After that, the next scene is

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-5
01:36:14.458 --> 01:36:18.703
him, I believe, tearing a page
out of that journal. Then after

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-6
01:36:18.703 --> 01:36:22.880
that we see him folding that
piece of paper that he just tore

4be503ab-ab59-42f7-8aa9-ba90719f783a-7
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.150
out.

65879f1b-e39a-4704-aa01-629b12e11711-0
01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.092
After that, we see that he's
actually folding the page again,

65879f1b-e39a-4704-aa01-629b12e11711-1
01:36:28.092 --> 01:36:32.304
or, you know, making it a little
bit more intricate. And then

65879f1b-e39a-4704-aa01-629b12e11711-2
01:36:32.304 --> 01:36:36.177
after that we see that he's
holding a paper bird between

65879f1b-e39a-4704-aa01-629b12e11711-3
01:36:36.177 --> 01:36:37.400
both of his hands.

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-0
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.345
In the final three small scenes,
first we see him like holding

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-1
01:36:43.345 --> 01:36:47.932
the paper bird up to face height
so that he's just examining it,

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-2
01:36:47.932 --> 01:36:51.884
I guess. Next he's looking
behind him over his shoulder

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-3
01:36:51.884 --> 01:36:55.906
while still sitting on his
suitcase. And then next he is

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-4
01:36:55.906 --> 01:37:00.211
standing up in front of his
suitcase. He's holding on to his

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-5
01:37:00.211 --> 01:37:04.657
booklet, his journal, and in the
right hand I think he's still

d891ef5f-e795-4d20-ba7e-48eb446aa73e-6
01:37:04.657 --> 01:37:08.749
holding the paper bird. That's
that's hard for me to see.

2718ced9-ea5e-410c-9bd5-23a7aaa49635-0
01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:09.520
On my screen.

ea5ea904-b1ad-45b6-933d-99b81f3e2754-0
01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.073
The next page is again three
small scenes with one larger

ea5ea904-b1ad-45b6-933d-99b81f3e2754-1
01:37:14.073 --> 01:37:17.474
one. So the small scenes are him
just really kind of looking

ea5ea904-b1ad-45b6-933d-99b81f3e2754-2
01:37:17.474 --> 01:37:20.708
around. First he is looking
behind him, then he's kind of

ea5ea904-b1ad-45b6-933d-99b81f3e2754-3
01:37:20.708 --> 01:37:24.164
looking upwards a little bit.
Now he's really looking upwards

ea5ea904-b1ad-45b6-933d-99b81f3e2754-4
01:37:24.164 --> 01:37:27.510
and shielding his eyes from the
sun using one of his hands.

1f896b77-44ad-41d8-8afd-a81b33f8c779-0
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:32.572
And in the larger scene below
that is we're at the bow of the

1f896b77-44ad-41d8-8afd-a81b33f8c779-1
01:37:32.572 --> 01:37:36.320
ship and lots of people are up
there, you know, just.

777a93f0-6b20-490f-99e2-de04d41e77be-0
01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.411
You know, we see them, you know,
dressed for travel. You know, we

777a93f0-6b20-490f-99e2-de04d41e77be-1
01:37:42.411 --> 01:37:46.960
see many of them have like their
bags with them and they're all

777a93f0-6b20-490f-99e2-de04d41e77be-2
01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.580
looking upwards. And the reason
for that is there are just these

777a93f0-6b20-490f-99e2-de04d41e77be-3
01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.987
dozens of white flying creatures
that have, you know, are are

777a93f0-6b20-490f-99e2-de04d41e77be-4
01:37:55.987 --> 01:37:58.120
flying by in this giant flock.

3f6fcc44-570b-4100-a64d-1664184f4c5c-0
01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:02.837
And I think it's just everyone
is amazed to see these flying

3f6fcc44-570b-4100-a64d-1664184f4c5c-1
01:38:02.837 --> 01:38:03.470
creatures.

07fb9319-dc18-4d6e-8ff6-61b811120fc5-0
01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:10.280
In the next scene we see still
the the bow of the boat with all

07fb9319-dc18-4d6e-8ff6-61b811120fc5-1
01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.721
of the people on it reaching a
harbor. In the background we see

07fb9319-dc18-4d6e-8ff6-61b811120fc5-2
01:38:14.721 --> 01:38:16.039
a cityscape like a.

dbab1ee4-e51a-4dad-a0b5-8a854b272005-0
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:22.442
Sort of a silhouetted cityscape
with many boats in the harbor

dbab1ee4-e51a-4dad-a0b5-8a854b272005-1
01:38:22.442 --> 01:38:27.511
that they're approaching. And
most notably in this scene are

dbab1ee4-e51a-4dad-a0b5-8a854b272005-2
01:38:27.511 --> 01:38:32.829
these two giant colossal statues
in the harbor itself. And like

dbab1ee4-e51a-4dad-a0b5-8a854b272005-3
01:38:32.829 --> 01:38:38.147
these statues are of two people
and the the people are reaching

dbab1ee4-e51a-4dad-a0b5-8a854b272005-4
01:38:38.147 --> 01:38:43.299
forward and shaking hands. So
like at the two statues kind of

dbab1ee4-e51a-4dad-a0b5-8a854b272005-5
01:38:43.299 --> 01:38:47.870
create like this big sort of
arch. The the two people.

44691e90-1ce1-43b7-a491-6395f069e16f-0
01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.298
They're kind of dressed
differently. They're wearing two

44691e90-1ce1-43b7-a491-6395f069e16f-1
01:38:51.298 --> 01:38:55.068
different style hats, each one
of which you know each. Each one

44691e90-1ce1-43b7-a491-6395f069e16f-2
01:38:55.068 --> 01:38:58.721
of the people in these statues
is holding some kind of animal

44691e90-1ce1-43b7-a491-6395f069e16f-3
01:38:58.721 --> 01:39:02.433
companion. One has like a mouse
kangaroo on his arm, the other

44691e90-1ce1-43b7-a491-6395f069e16f-4
01:39:02.433 --> 01:39:05.320
one has a bird kind of creature
on his shoulder.

ba3bf70e-5331-4c2c-b754-2f379b644b3d-0
01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:12.258
And in front of each statue is a
is a boat that they're both

ba3bf70e-5331-4c2c-b754-2f379b644b3d-1
01:39:12.258 --> 01:39:17.072
standing on with different like
wares, you know, like different

ba3bf70e-5331-4c2c-b754-2f379b644b3d-2
01:39:17.072 --> 01:39:19.480
possessions that they each have.

79b275ac-4dfd-4c7c-b618-1a3abb681f29-0
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:29.541
Now we see a sort of like
classic view of the front of

79b275ac-4dfd-4c7c-b618-1a3abb681f29-1
01:39:29.541 --> 01:39:34.724
this ocean liner, kind of like
coming into coming into port

79b275ac-4dfd-4c7c-b618-1a3abb681f29-2
01:39:34.724 --> 01:39:40.080
with all of the people still
standing on the bow of the ship.

79b275ac-4dfd-4c7c-b618-1a3abb681f29-3
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:40.340
Its

289073cd-09e9-4c8f-a970-366a2e8431ca-0
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:44.804
Its lines are now down, so like,
I think it's actually kind of

289073cd-09e9-4c8f-a970-366a2e8431ca-1
01:39:44.804 --> 01:39:48.680
attached to possibly a tugboat
nearby. We get to see, you know,

289073cd-09e9-4c8f-a970-366a2e8431ca-2
01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.950
like the silhouette of a buoy in
the foreground, but.

aff9dffb-1516-4149-9f21-f262fd5d731d-0
01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:57.373
You know, in some foreboding
clouds in the background. So in

aff9dffb-1516-4149-9f21-f262fd5d731d-1
01:39:57.373 --> 01:40:01.607
that scene the boat has just
come into harbor. Then the next

aff9dffb-1516-4149-9f21-f262fd5d731d-2
01:40:01.607 --> 01:40:03.620
few scenes are told in small.

8b7ff225-99de-4eeb-b6d9-e9d547f78605-0
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.758
Small pictures for the first six
and then a slightly larger one

8b7ff225-99de-4eeb-b6d9-e9d547f78605-1
01:40:08.758 --> 01:40:09.730
for the last one.

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-0
01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:15.291
So what's happening in these
small pictures is the people on

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-1
01:40:15.291 --> 01:40:19.684
the ship, we we see them just
kind of like looking and

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-2
01:40:19.684 --> 01:40:24.795
waiting. Next we see a man in a
white uniform with a white tall

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-3
01:40:24.795 --> 01:40:29.906
hat using a megaphone. So he's
like leaning forward and holding

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-4
01:40:29.906 --> 01:40:34.218
the megaphone up to his mouth
with one hand, and he's

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-5
01:40:34.218 --> 01:40:39.090
gesturing in a pointing gesture
with the other hand. Next we

fa399e6c-dde4-4ae1-bea2-c4242d0dcbe1-6
01:40:39.090 --> 01:40:39.410
see.

60405dcd-acb8-4bf3-9a1c-ddc6df5940b4-0
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:42.850
That hands are.

92e962b2-a0ee-4698-b650-943585344f6e-0
01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:48.156
In this scene where this door,
this yeah, just kind of like

92e962b2-a0ee-4698-b650-943585344f6e-1
01:40:48.156 --> 01:40:50.090
doorway is being unlatched.

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-0
01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:56.204
So something is being opened up.
Next we see a hand on a

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-1
01:40:56.204 --> 01:41:01.327
suitcase, so people are starting
to move. In the next two scenes,

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-2
01:41:01.327 --> 01:41:06.217
we see people lining up all of
their possessions and hand. Now

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-3
01:41:06.217 --> 01:41:10.642
they're like queuing up as
they're disembarking from the

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-4
01:41:10.642 --> 01:41:14.911
ship. And then in the last
larger scene, we see all of

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-5
01:41:14.911 --> 01:41:19.646
these, I guess, immigrants on
the dock of this area all kind

7fa2f15b-45b0-4b87-8e95-0862da3f6638-6
01:41:19.646 --> 01:41:21.820
of like lined up their bags.

3342aac8-6ad0-4af8-a578-98b76408b94f-0
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:24.957
At their feet, you know, and
just kind of waiting.

3342aac8-6ad0-4af8-a578-98b76408b94f-1
01:41:24.957 --> 01:41:25.800

39527f16-6d6d-4ade-97c7-760f3ff1810b-0
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.520
OK, perfect. Let me.

6eb4fc73-f5ac-4512-8111-27c35ec61085-0
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:32.910
