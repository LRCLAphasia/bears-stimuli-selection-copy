00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.920
OK.

1a5e9944-cb99-4422-9ad0-9243843334bc-0
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.365
So you are about to see a
complex scene. Imagine you are

1a5e9944-cb99-4422-9ad0-9243843334bc-1
00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.470
describing the scenes as someone
who cannot see the picture.

1a5e9944-cb99-4422-9ad0-9243843334bc-2
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.440
Describe what is happening and
what you see in this scene.

4a4b2841-be51-4497-a0ed-cd68b81bcce4-0
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.087
As thoroughly as possible,
please try to take roughly 3 to

4a4b2841-be51-4497-a0ed-cd68b81bcce4-1
00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:34.055
5 minutes to describe this
scene. Now I will pull up the

4a4b2841-be51-4497-a0ed-cd68b81bcce4-2
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:35.030
scene for you.

a0a2d5b1-d76e-494c-81f6-278420488833-0
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:55.780


eb51ee0a-e048-41bf-8f45-f120d1920cc3-0
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.520
Terials.

77f930a0-ffd8-4b8e-a21f-0e028f86e91a-0
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.040
OK.

a15d9467-e969-48ed-8992-0a7b30e105c6-0
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.410
And now I will share my screen.

93878c46-acd4-4983-b0c8-a8245e9793ad-0
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.550
And I will make this bigger for
you.

34e47230-18ca-4e49-887c-4a2da5ebc6df-0
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.540
OK, so.

af747c6c-5a31-4bff-ae5a-0429b1c7ddb3-0
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.473
Like I said before, just
describe the scene and take

af747c6c-5a31-4bff-ae5a-0429b1c7ddb3-1
00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:47.741
roughly 3 to 5 minutes and let
me know when you're ready or I

af747c6c-5a31-4bff-ae5a-0429b1c7ddb3-2
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:51.649
will tell you when the five
minutes is rough.

307a68fb-ebfc-41b4-9a0a-af6490ec4058-0
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.340
This this would really mess with
anyone's brain with aphasia.

18a7bbb5-4cb9-4b7a-a271-e9cf263d1867-0
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.891
#START_birthday_party_fun OK,
this scene has a lot of people

18a7bbb5-4cb9-4b7a-a271-e9cf263d1867-1
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:05.030
and a lot of animals and a lot
of activities in it.

665e7d2a-5b49-4927-b36e-a27a619cd70b-0
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.009
There's a large bouncy house
with a number of people in it.

665e7d2a-5b49-4927-b36e-a27a619cd70b-1
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.960
There's a witch and a.

4f1af2e2-529d-40e7-af4c-748da5c3c794-0
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.910
Little boy in a alligator
costume.

084a1d15-6e46-4251-b15f-9fd849b7b0cf-0
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.440
And a Bunny rabbit and a bat and
a clown and a little girl.

fad5f27e-051e-431a-a67f-31f43b3bff7f-0
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.745
Lots of other people are in the
bouncy house. The bouncy house

fad5f27e-051e-431a-a67f-31f43b3bff7f-1
00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:37.612
is bright colored yellow with
red on the corners which are

fad5f27e-051e-431a-a67f-31f43b3bff7f-2
00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:44.076
turrets. Looks like a castle and
people are sliding out of it on

fad5f27e-051e-431a-a67f-31f43b3bff7f-3
00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:45.170
a red ramp.

2d5e7ac2-9403-43b0-aecf-c28addcf28de-0
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.672
And then around it there's a lot
of other people. I don't know if

2d5e7ac2-9403-43b0-aecf-c28addcf28de-1
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:54.429
it's people in costumes. It
looks like people dressed up in

2d5e7ac2-9403-43b0-aecf-c28addcf28de-2
00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.370
costumes, like a costume party.

ede3ba8b-23f0-4753-98ca-a8a24da4322e-0
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.770
So there's a zebra and a lion. A
Penguin.

eb0f5ef7-bfa3-4575-b3d8-ec2f43ddd90b-0
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.679
And looks like an animal catcher
chasing them, elephant and a

eb0f5ef7-bfa3-4575-b3d8-ec2f43ddd90b-1
00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:11.678
giraffe. And then in front of
the bouncy house, a little ways

eb0f5ef7-bfa3-4575-b3d8-ec2f43ddd90b-2
00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:16.516
in front of there is a little
wading pool with some kids in

eb0f5ef7-bfa3-4575-b3d8-ec2f43ddd90b-3
00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:19.499
there splashing somebody with
water.

601a6287-33a7-4906-b10a-4927e2828859-0
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.439
Another little boy is spraying a
water gun at somebody and a

601a6287-33a7-4906-b10a-4927e2828859-1
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.610
couple kids are just just
lounging in the pool.

ddffc913-40ee-4968-a4c7-77b58d2f5f26-0
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.996
There's also a large table with
a lot of food on it. So there's

ddffc913-40ee-4968-a4c7-77b58d2f5f26-1
00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:41.061
sandwiches and cupcakes, looks
like salad and a cake and

ddffc913-40ee-4968-a4c7-77b58d2f5f26-2
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:46.392
cookies. A lot of people are
helping themselves through the

ddffc913-40ee-4968-a4c7-77b58d2f5f26-3
00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:49.680
food. There's a Princess and a
chef.

4c019afb-828e-4f5a-ba0b-59ca0dec05be-0
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.520
And a little girl dressed in a
strawberry costume.

141c2383-971b-41da-a5de-98921e2341d5-0
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.900
There's some.

568ae2bb-7103-4d24-a913-4b6595441817-0
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.320
Dogs. Real dogs. Not in, not in
a costume.

af49cd14-4502-41c7-95ee-40ebb073c7d4-0
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.080
And there's somebody in a little
pig costume.

3aa3d163-8123-4efc-a36e-54184b4e7fe7-0
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.073
There is. All of this is
enclosed in a little grass area

3aa3d163-8123-4efc-a36e-54184b4e7fe7-1
00:04:12.073 --> 00:04:17.211
that looks like there's a fence
at least on two sides, with a

3aa3d163-8123-4efc-a36e-54184b4e7fe7-2
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.200
house on the other side.

0b49f4d8-5870-4ad7-af7c-8cda52763087-0
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.479
And one of the fences, there's a
neighbor lady, an old neighbor

0b49f4d8-5870-4ad7-af7c-8cda52763087-1
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.824
lady with a Gray with Gray hair
and glasses looking over the

0b49f4d8-5870-4ad7-af7c-8cda52763087-2
00:04:28.824 --> 00:04:33.027
fence she probably wishes she
could join. There's a pinata

0b49f4d8-5870-4ad7-af7c-8cda52763087-3
00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:36.945
hanging from a tree, and a
little boy with a blindfold

0b49f4d8-5870-4ad7-af7c-8cda52763087-4
00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:41.433
who's trying to hit the pinata.
And another, a woman is trying

0b49f4d8-5870-4ad7-af7c-8cda52763087-5
00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:44.140
to guide the little boy a little
bit.

d56c5589-35df-4cf7-96bc-cd12a0f6a42d-0
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.910
There is a group playing tug of
war.

2c03a549-e89b-4999-8920-cb4331ffa63d-0
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.560
Looks like it might be girls
against boys.

28e2f18b-edfc-4807-9462-85b9463486fd-0
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.880
One side has someone who looks
like.

9b754353-b127-4b96-bdc0-d8fcd55d969a-0
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.770
Robin from Batman and a pirate
and a witch.

c58df796-9553-4adc-99bd-55032c70ba04-0
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.750
The other side has a Viking and
an Indian.

6b59a162-10c1-421a-aa3d-8d7b34c06621-0
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.150
And.

d7f479d9-8910-4f9f-ac2b-f5dbfeb9322f-0
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.012
I can't tell what that one is.
There's also some people who

d7f479d9-8910-4f9f-ac2b-f5dbfeb9322f-1
00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:19.889
look like they're just showing
up to the party. Must be a big

d7f479d9-8910-4f9f-ac2b-f5dbfeb9322f-2
00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.579
birthday party, and they are
handing someone some presents

d7f479d9-8910-4f9f-ac2b-f5dbfeb9322f-3
00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:25.079
and there's a big table.

55481374-5315-41c6-a865-fe818359c755-0
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.529
Filled with presents pink and
purple and yellow and orange and

55481374-5315-41c6-a865-fe818359c755-1
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.078
blue, all on a table that has
colorful pendants around it with

55481374-5315-41c6-a865-fe818359c755-2
00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:36.450
a white tablecloth.

3977cca9-fd30-4026-9e64-e4ef7d38b036-0
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.560
There are.

aec6cbdc-e143-44a3-b645-01a565c8c064-0
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.375
Let's see what these people are
doing. They're playing with

aec6cbdc-e143-44a3-b645-01a565c8c064-1
00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:51.020
water guns and somebody's
holding a hose.

1ed6b1fe-aa0b-429f-8f0e-0f36ae431a86-0
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.301
There's a lot of people in
costumes. There's a skeleton and

1ed6b1fe-aa0b-429f-8f0e-0f36ae431a86-1
00:05:57.301 --> 00:05:59.870
a devil and an Indian and a
robber.

c1b72026-894e-43ea-a8a4-dc3278e0c880-0
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.120
And a mummy and pilgrims.

5f8bfcec-c777-406c-97d9-69b638f33143-0
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.225
Um, there's also coming in. On
one side there's a green hedge

5f8bfcec-c777-406c-97d9-69b638f33143-1
00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:14.851
with a gate, and it looks like
that's how people are getting

5f8bfcec-c777-406c-97d9-69b638f33143-2
00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:18.358
into the party. Someone's
walking in with another present,

5f8bfcec-c777-406c-97d9-69b638f33143-3
00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:21.449
and some other people are
following, carrying other

5f8bfcec-c777-406c-97d9-69b638f33143-4
00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.469
presents.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.746
How long was that? yes, that
just hit. Yep, OK and now I will

e4a531ea-17f0-4e23-8eac-36676fd3cc04-1
00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:34.700
share the next one.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.410
See what's up next.

becfbb97-51d1-4533-82cc-62acd5008ea2-0
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.760
OK.

d8bf7c05-18c3-43d9-a72d-6ccc1e2807b9-0
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.120
But.

8c77e3d0-a586-455c-9aff-c0dc44ffcf66-0
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.970
The next.

2ae01c4d-b303-429a-b577-6dae7b78c711-0
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.370
OK. And?

9e329c97-948c-4d6f-b960-a3eae824b222-0
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.710
I'm going to share my screen.

870247cf-1de7-410c-8499-5b50bad0c88a-0
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.680
And I'm going to.

17ccf0d6-ee96-40b4-a3fa-3ef3a3633eb7-0
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.164
OK, so this is also another
complex scene. You could begin

17ccf0d6-ee96-40b4-a3fa-3ef3a3633eb7-1
00:07:20.164 --> 00:07:21.450
when you're ready.

18f88ab2-9122-404e-a86e-b7a280105053-0
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.770
#START_picture_this OK, so this
scene is.

ee2dac32-8043-4e05-9c7e-4ba518abab8f-0
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.255
Is a collage of pictures, and
each picture has a frame around

ee2dac32-8043-4e05-9c7e-4ba518abab8f-1
00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:34.510
it.

6c029405-f4d1-478b-9f9e-e8c6b7a44845-0
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.500
Umm.

76318d67-1af9-439a-a67a-4073a080aecc-0
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.657
Let's see. I'll just try to
describe some of the pictures.

76318d67-1af9-439a-a67a-4073a080aecc-1
00:07:42.657 --> 00:07:45.220
So there's pictures of sumo
wrestlers.

e2292dc6-f3d0-4dd2-93c3-fdfddfa48691-0
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.240
And fish.

5565af49-c37e-4db2-bb33-d3ce2b8de706-0
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.025
And an old man walking with an
umbrella and a suitcase, all

5565af49-c37e-4db2-bb33-d3ce2b8de706-1
00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:56.350
dressed in blue.

c430f6d2-1739-4c58-af7c-a362696f63a1-0
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.770
There's a camel.

e73e513a-330b-42c4-b88b-78f137989b53-0
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.730
There's.

9602606d-35f7-40ee-941a-4b89e9b74c8d-0
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.390
Uh, and and older man who is
bald with.

dd959090-798e-4725-9e8c-8d686f5a25bb-0
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.175
A little bit of brown hair and a
big brown mustache and brown

dd959090-798e-4725-9e8c-8d686f5a25bb-1
00:08:14.175 --> 00:08:14.770
eyebrows.

148fdc8e-111c-4714-bf2a-eadf77081d97-0
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.450
There's a.

15d030cd-c541-4c2e-8bde-fe78ce1ee913-0
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.327
Couple of boys leaning up
against a palm tree. One boy has

15d030cd-c541-4c2e-8bde-fe78ce1ee913-1
00:08:22.327 --> 00:08:26.512
a bright red shirt and blue
pants. The other boy has a green

15d030cd-c541-4c2e-8bde-fe78ce1ee913-2
00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:30.354
shirt and blue pants, and it
looks like they're shaking

15d030cd-c541-4c2e-8bde-fe78ce1ee913-3
00:08:30.354 --> 00:08:32.069
coconuts out of the tree.

4049e42f-4a71-4eb3-b83b-b655b1ff8d6d-0
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.650
There's.

6d8320ba-f574-4f4c-b876-189723527293-0
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.480
These are hard to describe.

73134c71-ac49-413b-96b4-ec36ef5774f1-0
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.035
There's a couple people looks
like just walking. Maybe a mom

73134c71-ac49-413b-96b4-ec36ef5774f1-1
00:08:46.035 --> 00:08:50.810
and her son and the moms got a
blue dress with a belt on and

73134c71-ac49-413b-96b4-ec36ef5774f1-2
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.750
white shoes.

7e6a9da9-1c7d-4f17-8e11-24b9ae27c4a7-0
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.486
And she's got dark hair. And the
boy or the man has also dark

7e6a9da9-1c7d-4f17-8e11-24b9ae27c4a7-1
00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:00.990
hair and a bright red shirt and
blue pants.

168f8f19-d1fa-47ca-9890-63aa825e7eb9-0
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.476
They're just walking. There's
another looks like a vendor

168f8f19-d1fa-47ca-9890-63aa825e7eb9-1
00:09:06.476 --> 00:09:11.449
who's selling hats and he has a
lot of hats on his head. In his

168f8f19-d1fa-47ca-9890-63aa825e7eb9-2
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:16.111
hand, he has a Red Hat and a
yellow hat, and he's got a big

168f8f19-d1fa-47ca-9890-63aa825e7eb9-3
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.530
across his shoulder. 2 bags, it
looks like.

06b29aea-592c-4e3c-b767-540f503facb4-0
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.429
It's not wearing any shoes. It's
white pants and a white shirt,

06b29aea-592c-4e3c-b767-540f503facb4-1
00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:30.436
and he has probably 20 hats on
top of his head. Blue, yellow,

06b29aea-592c-4e3c-b767-540f503facb4-2
00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:30.760
red.

9f5dd163-de1c-4e18-8222-1792910c7528-0
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.230
Green.

d8c21f98-0344-466e-a688-abdc5d04d6ef-0
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.430
Assume he's trying to sell them.
There's another person.

466f80a5-902f-4f56-aa84-b4b5ff6144ae-0
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.190
I guess playing.

3742b703-1e8e-42d4-a808-cd4724eb162a-0
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.018
Violin, but it looks like a very
large violin, and he's holding

3742b703-1e8e-42d4-a808-cd4724eb162a-1
00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:48.560
it kind of awkwardly. He has a
hat and a red.

e9084c6c-f6c4-4ae2-8217-88bcfcaf6d09-0
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.688
jacket looks like a cello, but
he's kind of playing it like a

e9084c6c-f6c4-4ae2-8217-88bcfcaf6d09-1
00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:54.170
violin.

a7a8505b-0b8f-4f33-8640-07cb5c84b15e-0
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.435
There's a cactus that is
running, so it's a green cactus

a7a8505b-0b8f-4f33-8640-07cb5c84b15e-1
00:09:59.435 --> 00:10:04.205
and you can see all the little
needles off of him and he's and

a7a8505b-0b8f-4f33-8640-07cb5c84b15e-2
00:10:04.205 --> 00:10:05.190
he's running.

24c3aed3-2bd8-47e9-a991-5f884e6c1750-0
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.440
There is.

dda3c59a-fa79-47f1-af5f-cc0ca9d74752-0
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.570
Man.

c96346a2-8cd0-416a-98d6-e4f60df2f23c-0
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.620
A man with Gray hair.

621670d9-3261-40d8-8d11-de672e87090f-0
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.180
And.

19baf5b4-12af-4f97-8a1c-9de9622cb971-0
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.650
Umm.

7ed0267e-7556-4cf2-9aa1-e0d913487165-0
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:26.281
A red grass skirt maybe? And
there's a bear who has a rope

7ed0267e-7556-4cf2-9aa1-e0d913487165-1
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:28.590
tied around the man.

0e27d0fc-78e2-471d-9384-f6b9243abec7-0
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.300
And the bear is holding up
something looking like.

ea0427b5-fcef-4ccc-9ed8-798a99d1e28c-0
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.610
A stick with two.

5e604a2b-08f6-4a8c-b775-2149ad7f64df-0
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.642
2 balls hanging off of it. Who?
And maybe he's trying to

5e604a2b-08f6-4a8c-b775-2149ad7f64df-1
00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:42.960
hypnotize the man.

70382359-5d74-44d2-8b5c-164a812c90d1-0
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.700
Umm.

c5bfcf40-198d-4691-b1bb-a8ba0e32fa03-0
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.230
That's quite odd.

b2f5e5c6-5b66-422e-83de-9f05c5442b6c-0
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.920
Let's.

3570c865-dcd9-4791-8a30-4883a1a11d79-0
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.633
These are very hard to describe.
There's a man who looks like he

3570c865-dcd9-4791-8a30-4883a1a11d79-1
00:10:58.633 --> 00:11:04.465
was in a boxing match, maybe
leaning laying over the the side

3570c865-dcd9-4791-8a30-4883a1a11d79-2
00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:10.014
ropes, and the man looks very
tired. His tongue is hanging

3570c865-dcd9-4791-8a30-4883a1a11d79-3
00:11:10.014 --> 00:11:15.470
out. He has a yellow shirt and a
blue hat and blue pants.

2607e41a-b94e-4848-a86a-093dd8c3b9ae-0
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.300
I don't know if he was fighting.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.602
How long was that? That was
perfect. I've I've been cutting

afc1efde-2615-49a9-b621-c6ea7ab57e72-1
00:11:23.602 --> 00:11:27.700
it around 4 minutes so it's in
the middle. OK here. Thank you.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.590
That those were hard to
describe.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.390
OK, now let me pull up the next
one.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.010
OK.

e9f9ce0a-642d-4bbe-875e-bba6cfc0caf6-0
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.090
Over the next.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.410
Makes sense?

bb4ac368-2d67-4fe9-ac5a-787af3de0c85-0
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.480
OK, I'm going to share my screen
now.

67081538-b56d-414b-9bf2-33757a76b3df-0
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.730
OK, do you see?

f1251fbd-75b4-4ccb-9688-10dd614366a2-0
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.420
By the lake.

facb9989-3d4d-4d11-a458-594953ef2bda-0
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.660
Yes, let.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:07.980
Present.

6d7af7f8-3a25-4dda-82e2-1c171d4b6c5d-0
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.190
Oh.

3060d8f8-af3d-4348-b43c-cfd4f60d26d5-0
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.350
Oh oh wait, what's happening?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.950
I didn't do that.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.542
Oh, there we go. Do you see it
now? OK, perfect. So like

2b4b93d9-08c7-40c2-924a-cad086f34581-1
00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:32.178
before, when you're ready, you
could just start describing

2b4b93d9-08c7-40c2-924a-cad086f34581-2
00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:35.999
there's just something covering
up. The bottom part says your

2b4b93d9-08c7-40c2-924a-cad086f34581-3
00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:39.820
session is live, but that's OK.
I can kind of see through it.

92fdb8f3-f667-451e-a115-b2e8c8b63d61-0
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.370
There we go.

8f71bc86-c3d2-4164-88de-b065f02a4273-0
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.505
#START_by_the_lake OK, so this
scene is at a lake and it looks

8f71bc86-c3d2-4164-88de-b065f02a4273-1
00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:51.680
like a mountain lake. In the
very back you can see really

8f71bc86-c3d2-4164-88de-b065f02a4273-2
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.760
tall mountains.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.220
And on the top of the mountains
is snow.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.290
And the sky is blue with some
white clouds.

75135d7f-d0c8-47b6-a551-d7bf2727c100-0
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.330
Around the lake there's a
castle.

ed87b3c7-dd10-4dc2-a5a7-6aae6f99b37a-0
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.005
And then on the other side, it
looks like a house with a lot of

ed87b3c7-dd10-4dc2-a5a7-6aae6f99b37a-1
00:14:15.005 --> 00:14:19.110
trees, tall trees, short trees,
medium trees, bushes.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:25.290
There is a lakeside cabin with a
front porch.

c43b08dc-b2bb-46ab-b09c-d6dde5df43a7-0
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.445
And on the front porch is a
yellow inflatable boat, and

c43b08dc-b2bb-46ab-b09c-d6dde5df43a7-1
00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:35.147
there's a man standing in pink
pants with a yellow shirt and

c43b08dc-b2bb-46ab-b09c-d6dde5df43a7-2
00:14:35.147 --> 00:14:39.925
blue cap with binoculars looking
out at everyone on the lake.

c43b08dc-b2bb-46ab-b09c-d6dde5df43a7-3
00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:44.550
There's a little boy running
down the path in front of him.

9d8168ea-cc24-433c-8f15-5fbf7a038492-0
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.638
With a yellow shirt and red
shorts carrying a blue bag,

9d8168ea-cc24-433c-8f15-5fbf7a038492-1
00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:51.620
running to greet a friend.

592bac36-502c-4841-895d-58fef0051fd7-0
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.711
In the lake, there's a lot of
people in the lake, so there's a

592bac36-502c-4841-895d-58fef0051fd7-1
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:02.055
group of people on a floating
platform. A lot of kids. Some

592bac36-502c-4841-895d-58fef0051fd7-2
00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:06.544
are sitting on the edge, some
are standing, some are climbing

592bac36-502c-4841-895d-58fef0051fd7-3
00:15:06.544 --> 00:15:10.815
up onto the platform on a
ladder. There's a boy sitting on

592bac36-502c-4841-895d-58fef0051fd7-4
00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:15.304
a chair on the platform. Some of
the kids are jumping off the

592bac36-502c-4841-895d-58fef0051fd7-5
00:15:15.304 --> 00:15:16.970
platform into the lake.

c4b095b7-d0ba-4f2a-9995-4471e3bc0a56-0
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.030
There's also people.

d80d7de8-1ab7-446c-ba94-d4338f8288b3-0
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.090

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.650
Kayaks paddling through the lake
in a red kayak and a blue kayak.

54c0a826-71f9-40a1-96a1-181d32ff44ce-0
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:36.625
There's three people on a green
and white jet ski and they're

54c0a826-71f9-40a1-96a1-181d32ff44ce-1
00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:42.050
all wearing orange life vests.
There is a dragon boat.

cdf0b9c7-37bb-461d-873e-51d4e4e33474-0
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.864
Full of people wearing yellow
shirts and dark pants, and

cdf0b9c7-37bb-461d-873e-51d4e4e33474-1
00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:53.595
they're rowing across the lake.
The dragon is yellow and green.

cdf0b9c7-37bb-461d-873e-51d4e4e33474-2
00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:58.789
There are some sailboats with
white sails and blue sails.

95eb77f0-2088-4de2-a9c5-2c107e6ff794-0
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.545
There is somebody parasailing,
looks like two people

95eb77f0-2088-4de2-a9c5-2c107e6ff794-1
00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:06.350
parasailing from a pink boat.
And their

63e4c1bb-9d90-4617-b13e-e72017496dc7-0
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.560
Parasail is all the colors of
the rainbow.

66317f30-7fdc-4268-989b-d4d448d7a85c-0
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.960
There.

352e30e8-7050-4364-8f8f-1503e97bb302-0
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.550
Are some dogs jumping into the
lake?

f79a1870-d352-4e66-ba4c-a14f16f93711-0
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.430
There are a group of people who
are building a large sandcastle.

1637307a-b4e0-4450-96d7-eabc0d3d0101-0
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.290
With an igloo.

98e82c87-ffae-4ad6-957f-ca73f247e9bd-0
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.900
And castles with turrets.

38fbf02d-6e4f-4b9b-a63a-4591d90e06ac-0
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.120
There is.

725bee6a-c7be-435d-9ed9-b07d8cbbfd96-0
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.220
People playing volleyball.

1009f526-1121-4c4e-bd9d-1be9dfde15f5-0
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.490
Umm.

a47e42dd-ad57-4fc9-8f03-782174711b44-0
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.908
Looks like a mix of boys and
girls are playing volleyball and

a47e42dd-ad57-4fc9-8f03-782174711b44-1
00:16:43.908 --> 00:16:48.236
someone is just hitting the ball
over the fence and he's got

a47e42dd-ad57-4fc9-8f03-782174711b44-2
00:16:48.236 --> 00:16:52.280
orange shorts and a pink shirt
on. I mean a pink cap on.

0296116b-d1c7-4e54-977b-e365e2c4be1d-0
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.593
There are people just sitting,
enjoying the days leading up

0296116b-d1c7-4e54-977b-e365e2c4be1d-1
00:16:57.593 --> 00:17:01.636
against a red and white boat,
and there's a man playing the

0296116b-d1c7-4e54-977b-e365e2c4be1d-2
00:17:01.636 --> 00:17:05.410
guitar and singing to another
girl sitting next to him.

14bddeb4-9b7c-48e7-9a12-8c818bc8a9a1-0
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.160
There are people flying kites,
there's a boy in.

94309b23-f432-4864-a74c-b91f3dd3877f-0
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.095
Bright green shorts with a
baseball cap turned backwards

94309b23-f432-4864-a74c-b91f3dd3877f-1
00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:19.671
and he's flying a kite that has
all the colors of the rainbow.

94309b23-f432-4864-a74c-b91f3dd3877f-2
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:20.580
#END_by_the_lake

bc5fa851-17e9-45dc-b4f4-044d087a67d4-0
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.690
You're just going to stop me
when time's up.

2aeb9cba-9dc1-40ee-8237-1206ae08c7eb-0
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.619
Oh yeah, you're you're good. So
we can move on to the next.

2aeb9cba-9dc1-40ee-8237-1206ae08c7eb-1
00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:32.320
There's so much you could talk
about this for hours.

3d63c384-6c58-4a4a-a788-dee3757aa627-0
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.260
Exactly.

4b96aace-42e3-41bf-8594-265f49961af7-0
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.750
Yeah, let me pull up the next
one.

8ccde5ab-9695-42fb-a9e9-17ddbd466717-0
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.928
Is there anything I should be
doing differently, or is this

8ccde5ab-9695-42fb-a9e9-17ddbd466717-1
00:17:44.928 --> 00:17:48.654
what you're looking for? Yeah,
this is what we're looking for,

8ccde5ab-9695-42fb-a9e9-17ddbd466717-2
00:17:48.654 --> 00:17:50.370
just describing what you see.

9928f634-5922-4497-8b63-2e81d492dc0e-0
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.620
Let's see what's next.

6b8d84d4-5e39-48ee-8391-c08b909e6c33-0
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:56.640
OK.

25fb9bd8-0bb7-43a8-b939-419bc361a30d-0
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.490
So the next.

2a8b3b91-f419-45b0-81b7-1fc7a84f4f58-0
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.310
Thing that we're going to do is
a complex.

ac90e560-3f9e-456e-9ed4-b74e1edd9b31-0
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.206
We were doing complex scenes and
now we're going to do a story.

ac90e560-3f9e-456e-9ed4-b74e1edd9b31-1
00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:24.080
So with this you will have to
just it's the same thing.

dfb6565c-109b-4040-ae0c-92e2ded1386a-0
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.360
Except we ask that you spend
like.

57e9fdf0-6434-4219-9675-e6e8ef496bb7-0
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.052
Let me just find the PowerPoint
really quick so I can make sure

57e9fdf0-6434-4219-9675-e6e8ef496bb7-1
00:18:33.052 --> 00:18:34.860
I'm saying the right amount
time.

69331b6d-f1d5-4c88-8553-d138b90bea78-0
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:38.630
OK.

c3e4c36a-d3f2-47c6-8db0-695bd2366dd0-0
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.092
OK, so with graphic novels, um,
you're going to be asked to look

c3e4c36a-d3f2-47c6-8db0-695bd2366dd0-1
00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:50.129
at a series of pictures that
tell a story. Imagine that you

c3e4c36a-d3f2-47c6-8db0-695bd2366dd0-2
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.695
were telling the story to
someone who cannot see the

c3e4c36a-d3f2-47c6-8db0-695bd2366dd0-3
00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:58.000
pictures. Describe what you see
and what is happening as you go

c3e4c36a-d3f2-47c6-8db0-695bd2366dd0-4
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.970
through the story, this story.
So the story will be about.

c42c88c5-3f23-4792-9e75-18d8e9b08806-0
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.145
But the examples like if it's
around 30 minutes long, it'll

c42c88c5-3f23-4792-9e75-18d8e9b08806-1
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.277
take roughly 10 to 15 minutes to
tell the story. So I will pull

c42c88c5-3f23-4792-9e75-18d8e9b08806-2
00:19:09.277 --> 00:19:11.430
up the story and see how many
slides it is.

3768735a-8a4e-49de-ad0c-89c04f27ed76-0
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.184
And you could tell me as you're
ready for me to like move

3768735a-8a4e-49de-ad0c-89c04f27ed76-1
00:19:16.184 --> 00:19:17.510
through each slide.

6b665ba2-bf52-4d22-94cc-d77aa0e17627-0
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.051
Are you going to tell me when 10
to 15 minutes is up or should I

6b665ba2-bf52-4d22-94cc-d77aa0e17627-1
00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:23.900
keep track OK?

4e98592b-db82-4561-acd5-358adb9f0f0a-0
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.510
I'll keep track of that.

e4e13380-4778-4748-ac50-2c956397f1fd-0
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:33.427
And you don't have to. So let me
just pull up the first one and

e4e13380-4778-4748-ac50-2c956397f1fd-1
00:19:33.427 --> 00:19:35.770
we'll see how long it is.

747194e5-23d0-42e2-a8ed-311edd9e546a-0
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.760
So you're gonna get.

4e80f7a7-eb3d-470a-81a9-93cc06b78db2-0
00:19:42.060 --> 00:20:00.470


6728f990-da91-42f3-82f8-630d3ec9be4c-0
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:07.700
Really.

e18c434d-1857-4079-93e3-27c36e0b75bf-0
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.980
OK, and I'm going to share my
screen now.

767baefa-944f-43d7-9567-2dfc798d214c-0
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.280
And there's the pictures in
there in sequential order, so.

714b061c-79f4-45b4-a2f0-9c37c35d0251-0
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.595
Yes, they will be influentials
order of a story. So this first

714b061c-79f4-45b4-a2f0-9c37c35d0251-1
00:20:25.595 --> 00:20:28.740
story that we have is 8 slides
long.

b6d3caa0-4e1e-4bc1-84db-185c2f442d04-0
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.301
You could tell me when to move
on. I will put it in present

b6d3caa0-4e1e-4bc1-84db-185c2f442d04-1
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:35.730
mode.

1f891b9d-ffb3-40bf-bc3a-3df560ee2627-0
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.722
Slideshow play from the
beginning. OK, so you could

1f891b9d-ffb3-40bf-bc3a-3df560ee2627-1
00:20:43.722 --> 00:20:44.270
begin.

296507ee-b32a-4100-a9c8-a420873a2c04-0
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.815
And I just started in anywhere
or you could start describing

296507ee-b32a-4100-a9c8-a420873a2c04-1
00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:52.610
anything on this page and when
you're done with this page, you

296507ee-b32a-4100-a9c8-a420873a2c04-2
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.840
tell me to move on to the next
page.

e8e5b579-5a67-4b46-82ad-14775ffbf5ad-0
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.720
OK.

4318d6db-9e5b-4c6e-ba90-f45db66882a9-0
00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.550


7527938a-0936-4b9d-8d2f-42347b6c741c-0
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.460
Well, let's see, there is a.

d08a0643-e41f-405b-b292-10b78289a237-0
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.831
#START_arrival_4 There is a man
standing, holding his stomach

d08a0643-e41f-405b-b292-10b78289a237-1
00:21:09.831 --> 00:21:10.800
and his neck.

ecd2dc8c-e431-4930-8545-353cde7c57ea-0
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.342
And I'm not sure if it's the
same and it looks like the same

ecd2dc8c-e431-4930-8545-353cde7c57ea-1
00:21:16.342 --> 00:21:20.572
man now is shaving. Looks like
he's probably getting ready to

ecd2dc8c-e431-4930-8545-353cde7c57ea-2
00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:21.459
go somewhere.

5e6a2236-f567-4763-9a0e-0337563a2786-0
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.530
I don't know if he's shaving.

925b7772-2d3e-4823-b31e-f4c328b04714-0
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.139
Yes, he's shaving. He's getting
ready to go some somewhere. So

925b7772-2d3e-4823-b31e-f4c328b04714-1
00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:33.662
he's standing in the bathroom
leaning over the sink and now

925b7772-2d3e-4823-b31e-f4c328b04714-2
00:21:33.662 --> 00:21:38.335
he's getting dressed. So he's
putting on a vest for his suit.

925b7772-2d3e-4823-b31e-f4c328b04714-3
00:21:38.335 --> 00:21:42.858
He already has on a white shirt
and he's buttoning his dark

925b7772-2d3e-4823-b31e-f4c328b04714-4
00:21:42.858 --> 00:21:47.532
colored vest. He's also got some
dark colored shoes that he's

925b7772-2d3e-4823-b31e-f4c328b04714-5
00:21:47.532 --> 00:21:49.040
leaning over to tie.

96bdae0e-d300-4d2f-8ee6-50f26da688b2-0
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.310
He is.

856a7b4a-0bd8-4c74-b145-1c9d3304bd1c-0
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.037
Looks like maybe getting some
money ready. Um, some paper

856a7b4a-0bd8-4c74-b145-1c9d3304bd1c-1
00:21:58.037 --> 00:22:02.300
money and coins. He's got it in
his hand right now. He's

856a7b4a-0bd8-4c74-b145-1c9d3304bd1c-2
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.040
reaching for his hat, which is
also dark colored.

9a8bd040-5bda-492f-ad74-d8e31247032d-0
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:13.221
Now he's looking at a map, a
very detailed map of streets and

9a8bd040-5bda-492f-ad74-d8e31247032d-1
00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:14.160
buildings.

a61a7e86-cb06-4243-a40a-58bb157a8969-0
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.794
He's folding... he's unfolding
the map so he can take a good

a61a7e86-cb06-4243-a40a-58bb157a8969-1
00:22:19.794 --> 00:22:23.260
look at it, and he's standing
out on a street corner.

075efe8f-3c3e-408c-82a0-f8049585f0e7-0
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.330
Looking at the map and studying
it.

48699a60-a411-4413-a6f6-3dc5953d852e-0
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.366
Trying to figure out where he's
supposed to go. He's walking

48699a60-a411-4413-a6f6-3dc5953d852e-1
00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:36.252
down the street and he's being
followed by a very strange

48699a60-a411-4413-a6f6-3dc5953d852e-2
00:22:36.252 --> 00:22:37.190
little animal.

ec8f2674-9b65-43b4-9ee5-dcbdee686367-0
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:44.495
With four legs and two ears,
looks like a fish that is not in

ec8f2674-9b65-43b4-9ee5-dcbdee686367-1
00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:50.065
water. Walking down the street
with him, he's out on a very

ec8f2674-9b65-43b4-9ee5-dcbdee686367-2
00:22:50.065 --> 00:22:50.529
busy.

b1064d4e-7375-48b5-bd80-11d070866953-0
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.410
Interstate Highway in a.

1d25c356-920c-4329-8825-60f42b9eff76-0
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.837
It is looks like in a city with
tall high-rise buildings, a lot

1d25c356-920c-4329-8825-60f42b9eff76-1
00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.760
of cars are on the highway.

e9a9b8cb-bcef-4ce7-a28f-50e4bc9e96b6-0
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.850
He's back to studying his map.

49d6f8d8-966f-4ca1-baf2-8140d3f3f8a3-0
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.239
And he seems a little confused
as to where he's supposed to go.

49d6f8d8-966f-4ca1-baf2-8140d3f3f8a3-1
00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:14.288
So he's looking very closely at
one section of the map. The

49d6f8d8-966f-4ca1-baf2-8140d3f3f8a3-2
00:23:14.288 --> 00:23:18.337
animal that's following him is
still following him, and the

49d6f8d8-966f-4ca1-baf2-8140d3f3f8a3-3
00:23:18.337 --> 00:23:19.890
animal has a tail also.

b5e060c5-80f0-4a09-8e73-0c128da81393-0
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.610
And is looking at the man.

bb687695-36b2-44b4-93f5-66f18fbb64d6-0
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.910
Now he's under a very tall.

2fc24178-4a8f-4c40-92cf-8079703a58c9-0
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.350
Bridge that looks like it's.

23f804f6-e931-47f4-a0f6-fb59bea2607c-0
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.600
Under water.

45540614-ff66-413e-b5be-01e42e4c4702-0
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.810
With boats going through the
arches of the bridge.

ef61b37f-28b5-4907-8306-5e2d912b76b4-0
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:47.050
And along the bottom of the
arches are a number of.

74a914b9-d6e4-445e-b9d4-cbabae593ae3-0
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:53.312
Buildings that look like
teepees. But I think the teepees

74a914b9-d6e4-445e-b9d4-cbabae593ae3-1
00:23:53.312 --> 00:23:58.502
are not built out of canvas. It
looks like they're built out of

74a914b9-d6e4-445e-b9d4-cbabae593ae3-2
00:23:58.502 --> 00:23:59.070
cement.

bd19c98f-0bd7-4593-ac91-491c635bea5e-0
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.900
The teepees also have big like.

ec54499c-6829-4172-b339-336df92c3435-0
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:10.800
Portholes in them tips are
decorated with stripes and.

70abdd72-af5c-4fcb-894a-28d7a3f2f38a-0
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.345
Can't really tell if they're
colored. A lot of people are

70abdd72-af5c-4fcb-894a-28d7a3f2f38a-1
00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:17.520
standing along the.

74d011b5-cebe-4a13-9539-9f98b31793e5-0
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.610
The area around the teepees.

87e9f6ab-7d41-45ce-9082-b5d2cafe22e3-0
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.541
Looks like the man who was
studying the map with the animal

87e9f6ab-7d41-45ce-9082-b5d2cafe22e3-1
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:29.792
who's following him is also
standing there, still looking at

87e9f6ab-7d41-45ce-9082-b5d2cafe22e3-2
00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:30.350
his map.

28902537-bd7f-4aa5-8e24-6bdf1541d0c2-0
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.290
There are some other animals
walking along looks like a.

d2f5118d-9523-4210-b903-ddcd5e02eee6-0
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.180
Dog and a cat and a snail.

7d8a8776-ad2c-433d-825b-143d6ad9c665-0
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.580
And a bird flying.

e78c5a38-b8f4-4ac7-a888-c79c295f226b-0
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.470
There.

d1eef24b-64a6-4fa7-958c-aad1480462fc-0
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.854
Seem to be a lot of boats. I
don't know if they're in in the

d1eef24b-64a6-4fa7-958c-aad1480462fc-1
00:24:51.854 --> 00:24:54.760
water or if these are flying
boats.

d8b602ec-d57c-4e29-b513-249cf3bb4fda-0
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.490
Going through the arches.

3f76b06f-76ac-438f-96d9-15c46c401fa4-0
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.430
Small boats and couple very
large boats.

fe143afe-2582-4432-b7b6-ffbca3b5cbd4-0
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.720
Umm.

89d88b6a-87a2-4ca4-9964-fbfa8c469ce3-0
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.560
It looks like in the.

c94f9dc2-408b-4954-9343-8ebbcf858fd4-0
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.450
In the back way behind the.

b6be2150-8feb-4b34-a984-ef667737aee7-0
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.380
Bridge.

ac231b9d-50e0-40cb-ae20-c8f15b39a529-0
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.480
Through the arches you can see
what looks like.

fac9ed41-a158-41a3-a0fc-e8ad56f2f3ef-0
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.490
Hillsides with trees.

6be4fb1c-7a54-441b-a439-fd3cd6c4c41e-0
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.420
And a road.

33e15677-10f2-4b9e-9664-97e1a32d4be3-0
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.490
Perhaps.

d2853727-d1de-41f5-9cb0-3ee3c9e228d7-0
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.957
They don't think these people,
these boats are underwater. I

d2853727-d1de-41f5-9cb0-3ee3c9e228d7-1
00:25:35.957 --> 00:25:39.454
think these boats are flying
boats. If they were underwater,

d2853727-d1de-41f5-9cb0-3ee3c9e228d7-2
00:25:39.454 --> 00:25:41.689
the people wouldn't be standing
there.

9766d192-a43f-4d02-a6a4-b7f0bf15275b-0
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.030
{Would you like me to?

5de596f2-9add-4fdb-ae4a-30c1e2ef9ad1-0
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.380
Sure.}

ef94f3ec-738b-4684-9244-7a52a9c57ed4-0
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.592
So the next page has this
strange looking animal again

ef94f3ec-738b-4684-9244-7a52a9c57ed4-1
00:25:55.592 --> 00:26:00.795
with the tail and feet talking
to another very strange looking

ef94f3ec-738b-4684-9244-7a52a9c57ed4-2
00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:02.860
animal that looks like a.

eb61f955-d0bf-4b9c-a0ec-5545237c7bfd-0
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.860
Bird, perhaps with two legs and
two big pointy ears.

044bc00a-9e6b-4365-949c-9dc10c2f9473-0
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:16.145
Standing by those two people is
the man who we have been talking

044bc00a-9e6b-4365-949c-9dc10c2f9473-1
00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:20.617
about with the dark Gray suit
and dark hat and with the map,

044bc00a-9e6b-4365-949c-9dc10c2f9473-2
00:26:20.617 --> 00:26:25.236
and next to him now is a lady
who looks like she is reading in

044bc00a-9e6b-4365-949c-9dc10c2f9473-3
00:26:25.236 --> 00:26:29.855
a book. She has a long dress and
dark hair, and now the man is

044bc00a-9e6b-4365-949c-9dc10c2f9473-4
00:26:29.855 --> 00:26:34.327
asking her a question, maybe
asking for directions or if she

044bc00a-9e6b-4365-949c-9dc10c2f9473-5
00:26:34.327 --> 00:26:36.160
knows where something is.

6f9f17b6-04ca-4aba-bbdc-63715e9bdc38-0
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.701
The lady has stopped reading her
book, and now she's pointing to

6f9f17b6-04ca-4aba-bbdc-63715e9bdc38-1
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.090
the map helping the man.

2a3d09e7-bff7-43e0-b36b-9145420affab-0
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.140
To find something on the map.

3f86fc71-9902-4322-8387-90907394516b-0
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.140
She's pointing to an object on
the map.

2a2bd898-08df-47cf-ab26-2ee0b62f5f25-0
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:57.630
The woman is talking to what
looks like a telephone.

611b1a49-999f-4763-8fd2-6ec055786e4b-0
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.360
Robot.

25879f60-02a2-4ffd-80ec-70283363e1d8-0
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:06.348
But it has a Rotary dial, like
on the old Rotary dial phones.

25879f60-02a2-4ffd-80ec-70283363e1d8-1
00:27:06.348 --> 00:27:10.817
And now I think the man is
probably dialing a number or the

25879f60-02a2-4ffd-80ec-70283363e1d8-2
00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:15.361
woman is dialing a number on
there and she's pulling a lever

25879f60-02a2-4ffd-80ec-70283363e1d8-3
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:17.000
and now there's a big.

d09acee2-16af-4dcc-b733-b81a41231870-0
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.010
Like megaphone.

c3283bca-5fba-45b7-a7f5-633d2bf407cb-0
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.140
On this robot telephone and it's
issuing a ticket.

1deee914-e62a-40b8-a608-e1a7c8be4d53-0
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.071
And she is pointing to the
ticket and handing it to the man

1deee914-e62a-40b8-a608-e1a7c8be4d53-1
00:27:31.071 --> 00:27:35.720
and he's putting the ticket in
his hand and he's holding it.

98e76473-05d0-4c06-8cad-fe652ee6d727-0
00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.800
And.

05db3003-25cc-42b8-bc73-a1762de6d8df-0
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.816
Now there's a group of people
who are around the teepee

05db3003-25cc-42b8-bc73-a1762de6d8df-1
00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:48.862
looking buildings pointing up in
the sky at the boats that are

05db3003-25cc-42b8-bc73-a1762de6d8df-2
00:27:48.862 --> 00:27:50.340
flying through the air.

345c90b0-b509-45e2-988d-7a1587e81287-0
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.240
Um, some people are pointing.

3bb06423-4b9a-4d84-9ff3-fbc3590746cb-0
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.430
A man on a bicycle is standing
and looking.

b1368266-9473-4c49-af8c-28ab4a4fa0d3-0
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.517
A lot of people are facing,
facing away, looking up at the

b1368266-9473-4c49-af8c-28ab4a4fa0d3-1
00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:05.870
sky.

894d61ab-14b1-4d9c-970b-782b844828bb-0
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.210
The strange animal with the tail
and the four legs is still

894d61ab-14b1-4d9c-970b-782b844828bb-1
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.221
following the man, who has
folded up his map and is walking

894d61ab-14b1-4d9c-970b-782b844828bb-2
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:17.889
somewhere.

ed71b740-fa42-43f5-b5ef-fbc5b3e11064-0
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.708
It looks like maybe a big boat
is there and now someone is

ed71b740-fa42-43f5-b5ef-fbc5b3e11064-1
00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:28.240
punching his ticket and guiding
him in.

0f250c4e-9814-4200-ba51-3366f0efa154-0
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:37.035
So now the man is about to sit
down on a bench with his strange

0f250c4e-9814-4200-ba51-3366f0efa154-1
00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:41.770
looking animal that's following
him and he's talking to another

0f250c4e-9814-4200-ba51-3366f0efa154-2
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.357
woman and there's other people
around, a woman with a baby on

0f250c4e-9814-4200-ba51-3366f0efa154-3
00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:51.240
her on her back in a little pack
and another man sitting in front

0f250c4e-9814-4200-ba51-3366f0efa154-4
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.350
of him reading.

7ced7a01-aae9-4126-9b93-34a94326313d-0
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.410
And the man is talking to this
woman, and.

341bc220-68fe-4baf-b094-0ffacc2a3e63-0
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.340
Gesturing with his hands. His
hand is his hands are out, maybe

341bc220-68fe-4baf-b094-0ffacc2a3e63-1
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.962
asking a question. So now he's
reaching in his suit coat pocket

341bc220-68fe-4baf-b094-0ffacc2a3e63-2
00:29:05.962 --> 00:29:10.368
and he's taking something out
and he's showing the woman a a

341bc220-68fe-4baf-b094-0ffacc2a3e63-3
00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:13.979
flyer. And it looks like the
flyer has a picture.

920bf47d-a614-410a-9810-3a7e5522ae21-0
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:19.626
On it, along with a number of
words, and the woman is looking

920bf47d-a614-410a-9810-3a7e5522ae21-1
00:29:19.626 --> 00:29:20.620
at the flyer.

d1eaa88f-8c5e-46e4-acc3-f8a568d02700-0
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:27.544
Now she's holding the flyer and
asking him some questions about

d1eaa88f-8c5e-46e4-acc3-f8a568d02700-1
00:29:27.544 --> 00:29:33.426
it. On the Flyer is a picture of
a young girl with chin length

d1eaa88f-8c5e-46e4-acc3-f8a568d02700-2
00:29:33.426 --> 00:29:36.040
hair. She looks kind of sad.

bd295746-9c5c-4aa7-b6f2-e0c23552b7df-0
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.862
I can't read anything that's on
the flyer, though it looks now

bd295746-9c5c-4aa7-b6f2-e0c23552b7df-1
00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:45.104
like we have gone to maybe where
this little girl is. Maybe this

bd295746-9c5c-4aa7-b6f2-e0c23552b7df-2
00:29:45.104 --> 00:29:47.520
man is looking for this little
girl.

0c202c10-fc00-46bc-a35c-71c13eb29184-0
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.884
So this little girl with the
short chin length dark hair is

0c202c10-fc00-46bc-a35c-71c13eb29184-1
00:29:51.884 --> 00:29:55.600
reading a book and now it looks
like someone is coming up to

0c202c10-fc00-46bc-a35c-71c13eb29184-2
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.560
take the book away from her and
she doesn't want him to do that.

8c0883db-92b3-494e-858e-99604481959f-0
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.860
But someone has taken the book
away from her and put it in a

efe2c014-d471-46a3-b708-1db4a8813df7-0
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.400
Pulled out a drawer in a dresser
and he's putting the book away

efe2c014-d471-46a3-b708-1db4a8813df7-1
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.930
and he's put a lock on it and
locked it up.

12917071-2ced-4a59-812f-cae55a66bc43-0
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:16.619
So now he's handing the little
girl a shovel, and the little

12917071-2ced-4a59-812f-cae55a66bc43-1
00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:18.800
girl has gone over to a big.

6fe0ba13-76ef-436f-9d41-f15cd972c2ee-0
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.780
Furnace looking.

275818db-5143-4921-9e07-016d6008d74d-0
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.240
Object that.

666deccd-6b4a-4664-bde8-3894580a64e5-0
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.831
Has fire inside of it, and she's
shoveling something inside

666deccd-6b4a-4664-bde8-3894580a64e5-1
00:30:28.831 --> 00:30:29.220
there.

12705fb9-25d7-4755-a41b-ab0a58cb5a01-0
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.350
Inside the into the fire and now
a lot of smoke is coming out.

877b77da-eaff-4220-9f52-f0ce08f919e1-0
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.941
And she is on a ladder, climbing
up to the top to clean out the

877b77da-eaff-4220-9f52-f0ce08f919e1-1
00:30:40.941 --> 00:30:41.470
chimney.

0cd93ec1-b386-4415-863b-d280505c01d7-0
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.320
So there are a lot of.

a4212b18-2c32-4fae-8fb5-62779daa1352-0
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.480
Looks like younger children.

ca313bca-1b99-4b2f-9a1a-89480be3cd4a-0
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.310
Each shoveling.

c558f533-d7e9-41cf-b293-bf0a5028ceba-0
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.070
It's probably coal or something
into these furnaces.

118ef99d-6156-4237-9ed2-c30802c990a5-0
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:08.040
Each furnace is divided by a by
by cement walls, and each

118ef99d-6156-4237-9ed2-c30802c990a5-1
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:14.740
furnace has a large smokestack
that has smoke coming out of it.

a61f9e99-ad13-4631-8237-f387a3494e85-0
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:20.181
You can see the little girl has
climbed up to the top and is

a61f9e99-ad13-4631-8237-f387a3494e85-1
00:31:20.181 --> 00:31:22.700
cleaning out one of the
smokestacks.

5b8cb38f-4e55-4aae-96f2-a1f29a034bcd-0
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.776
And now she's sitting on the
side with holding her head in

5b8cb38f-4e55-4aae-96f2-a1f29a034bcd-1
00:31:27.776 --> 00:31:32.188
her hands. And now she's gone
back with the shovel. It looks

5b8cb38f-4e55-4aae-96f2-a1f29a034bcd-2
00:31:32.188 --> 00:31:36.455
like maybe she's trying to
escape. She's put the shovel in

5b8cb38f-4e55-4aae-96f2-a1f29a034bcd-3
00:31:36.455 --> 00:31:40.721
the side of the door and has
managed to pry the door open,

5b8cb38f-4e55-4aae-96f2-a1f29a034bcd-4
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:45.277
checking to make sure nobody is
seeing her. She found the keys

5b8cb38f-4e55-4aae-96f2-a1f29a034bcd-5
00:31:45.277 --> 00:31:49.400
for the drawer that has her
book. She opened the drawer.

6bdbab00-995f-4b4a-af60-46de5a9ccd85-0
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:54.302
By putting the key into the
lock, and now she's gotten her

6bdbab00-995f-4b4a-af60-46de5a9ccd85-1
00:31:54.302 --> 00:31:55.910
book and she is running.

70b59d21-0267-446a-b80d-2fd1dbc85b68-0
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.384
She has escaped through by
crawling through a window, still

70b59d21-0267-446a-b80d-2fd1dbc85b68-1
00:32:03.384 --> 00:32:05.250
holding her book.

4f6a3c42-f97f-42e2-8c77-fadb4f1f9d5f-0
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:09.910
And she has found a train and
climbed onto 1 into one of the

4f6a3c42-f97f-42e2-8c77-fadb4f1f9d5f-1
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:14.023
train cars and is huddled in the
train car with her book by her

4f6a3c42-f97f-42e2-8c77-fadb4f1f9d5f-2
00:32:14.023 --> 00:32:16.530
side, and the train is traveling
away.

b0c645c8-64d5-4abe-80bb-359eb318e6b2-0
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.491
Now we're back to a scene where
it looks like these boats that

b0c645c8-64d5-4abe-80bb-359eb318e6b2-1
00:32:25.491 --> 00:32:29.166
are flying in the air. The boat
has a lot of people on it with a

b0c645c8-64d5-4abe-80bb-359eb318e6b2-2
00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:32.050
large smokestack and white smoke
coming out of it.

2d9d1dac-d02e-43ce-b398-3aaa9a3555f3-0
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.033
It looks like they're in a
foreign country because the

2d9d1dac-d02e-43ce-b398-3aaa9a3555f3-1
00:32:36.033 --> 00:32:39.287
words that are on the signs
along on the sides of the

2d9d1dac-d02e-43ce-b398-3aaa9a3555f3-2
00:32:39.287 --> 00:32:39.830
building.

1e093232-ceb2-4309-bc7f-e1539f3e00e9-0
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.345
Are in a language that I can't
read. It looks like different

1e093232-ceb2-4309-bc7f-e1539f3e00e9-1
00:32:44.345 --> 00:32:45.180
symbols maybe.

00f511cc-b92e-4733-a9b3-ed1ff78a3b2d-0
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.320
Asian symbols.

1a6535b4-c291-4df8-8b73-9a2241002d8e-0
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.040
A billboard with a woman with a
cup of coffee and she's smiling.

45d0e2e7-8c7a-4e70-90b0-cfa5a250be37-0
00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.960
Then there is.

222203ff-d392-4b85-a54e-43717a9d0e37-0
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:03.770
I think the man who has been
searching with the map.

cd734ce2-e5ab-4bd0-91b7-6efb6ad785b5-0
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.773
Is sitting on the bench talking
to a woman with a white dress

cd734ce2-e5ab-4bd0-91b7-6efb6ad785b5-1
00:33:08.773 --> 00:33:12.500
and she has dark hair and she's
pointing off to the side.

05c17a29-4a83-4e51-be5b-025c75f87788-0
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.080
There's a man with a megaphone.

2cdefc67-fba5-4d04-8a6c-b5fd9756ee4f-0
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.380
I don't know what he's
announcing.

2de20465-9a90-4005-b3c9-f77dad3f91ac-0
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.438
And it looks like people
standing along a pier with a

2de20465-9a90-4005-b3c9-f77dad3f91ac-1
00:33:24.438 --> 00:33:24.830
big.

88bc4b6a-66b2-4372-b04f-32a487caa055-0
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.200
With the big boat.

782464ed-dc16-409e-82e6-13cb46a7c980-0
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.214
The the man with the dark suit
and the map is saying goodbye to

782464ed-dc16-409e-82e6-13cb46a7c980-1
00:33:32.214 --> 00:33:32.810
the woman.

2f6dda15-58ac-4eb3-a3f0-9f87189af486-0
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.047
Who's still sitting on the
bench. She's the one in the

2f6dda15-58ac-4eb3-a3f0-9f87189af486-1
00:33:37.047 --> 00:33:40.872
white dress. And now the man's
walking away with his strange

2f6dda15-58ac-4eb3-a3f0-9f87189af486-2
00:33:40.872 --> 00:33:42.690
looking animal following him.

2a1318c0-2130-49f8-b70e-7a22209cf04a-0
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.221
And he's thinking about
something and has his hand on

2a1318c0-2130-49f8-b70e-7a22209cf04a-1
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:46.700
his chin.

2413d909-a31b-4872-ac88-591d252e585e-0
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.960
Now he's looking at a big
strange scene of.

21377ea8-198a-48d4-a63a-76e52d27ff05-0
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.450
Of buildings.

a0611a1b-7482-4e8a-b94d-8013944c847d-0
00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:58.830
With.

e3436311-8335-44eb-8bcc-c35d2997e4d8-0
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.350
Umm.

7d82e0d8-f476-46ab-a723-748ba89548e9-0
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.970
Pathways and and.

a532fb7d-080f-4d05-b242-88c7e9dff678-0
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.510
Short walls leading.

956efcc1-e8f2-4120-8a17-57ce7c81f3b3-0
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:13.135
Down to an area where there is a
very large animal. I don't know

956efcc1-e8f2-4120-8a17-57ce7c81f3b3-1
00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:18.623
if it's a real animal or a
statue who's holding a bowl with

956efcc1-e8f2-4120-8a17-57ce7c81f3b3-2
00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:19.630
maybe some.

8c2c3c6e-9a0d-4990-9830-d9b1c6e3cd40-0
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.050
Food in it.

81b7c574-b22c-4bd1-8cc0-56835c92d0d7-0
00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.624
And there's also some other
people walking around, one with

81b7c574-b22c-4bd1-8cc0-56835c92d0d7-1
00:34:27.624 --> 00:34:32.135
a basket and another one, and an
older man with somebody helping

81b7c574-b22c-4bd1-8cc0-56835c92d0d7-2
00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:32.760
him walk.

3c3aa969-f506-432d-b54e-ac9419f298a4-0
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.620
OK.

78b05da4-a95b-4f09-8880-b4893b8b72a8-0
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.561
Now the man in the brown suit is
still walking down the sidewalk

78b05da4-a95b-4f09-8880-b4893b8b72a8-1
00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:47.370
with his strange little animal
helper.

c0f3ad2b-487a-44ba-9a69-916d16b5b8f7-0
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.670
And there's a lot of people,
different people walking around.

e7a8d806-101a-49c5-ab51-d25f76b8b7f6-0
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.210
Umm.

f1055a89-5c4e-4e5c-bdfb-0562a7aa85df-0
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.260
And.

a1097bf6-4938-4ff1-b803-28165e93cfc7-0
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.770
It looks like an older.

d1e651d2-2438-444c-8364-b2623378b5e1-0
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:07.550
It looks like a man is maybe
selling some fish.

0140ec76-c045-4940-994e-1b55b0c80d38-0
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.508
Or alive fish? and an older man
with a beret is looking at it.

0140ec76-c045-4940-994e-1b55b0c80d38-1
00:35:13.508 --> 00:35:16.450
There's somebody looking in a
book.

b87ea2c3-45e9-4d73-8e37-9ebe149fdd61-0
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:25.023
That has a lot of drawings of
apple and cheese and bread and

b87ea2c3-45e9-4d73-8e37-9ebe149fdd61-1
00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:25.650
fish.

05dfbc26-1528-4ea7-baf4-5f8afffd174f-0
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.210
And milk.

a185f4df-fe47-49f8-88d8-d616db0885c1-0
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.440
And.

af49f1a9-1328-4411-a6cd-a9506185dea5-0
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.810
There is a wall with.

4d41097e-4b71-4f58-b95f-5582cc40cbd1-0
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:38.412
Maybe a lot of drawers, and the
strange little animal is looking

4d41097e-4b71-4f58-b95f-5582cc40cbd1-1
00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:39.700
at one of the drawers.

7c8eb049-2dce-4795-837c-5d4948c32065-0
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.776
And the man in the dark suit
with the map has now opened one

7c8eb049-2dce-4795-837c-5d4948c32065-1
00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:46.650
of the one of the drawers.

61ca17a7-a2b4-49b7-b68f-ac672447110f-0
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.910
So now the man's looking at a
book.

2b1d8036-6962-4852-a85f-9fd5b199a7f3-0
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.120
Now someone is taking something
out of one of those drawers.

1da075fc-e4a0-4ae3-a6a2-68bea7f7edb5-0
00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.590
And it looks like a boy is
holding.

97982726-f48a-44d8-b458-f6911cc46430-0
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:00.950
Umm.

3499b07a-4ab8-4c2a-ab8f-64ff72a5881e-0
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.020
Maybe some fruit?

f08c2bae-425e-4287-9c9b-dfce027b6c4e-0
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.546
Looks like a large strawberry.
Maybe he's trying to sell it to

f08c2bae-425e-4287-9c9b-dfce027b6c4e-1
00:36:09.546 --> 00:36:13.696
the to the man, but the man is
pointing to his book with the

f08c2bae-425e-4287-9c9b-dfce027b6c4e-2
00:36:13.696 --> 00:36:18.050
pictures, and in the book is a
loaf of bread, and he's pointing

f08c2bae-425e-4287-9c9b-dfce027b6c4e-3
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.160
to the loaf of bread, and he's.

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-0
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.580
I think asking if it can be
sliced. He's making a motion

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-1
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:28.526
with his hand like he's slicing
something. There's another man

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-2
00:36:28.526 --> 00:36:32.285
who is wearing glasses and a
white shirt and suspenders and

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-3
00:36:32.285 --> 00:36:36.356
he's pointing to something else
on the wall, the wall that looks

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-4
00:36:36.356 --> 00:36:40.115
like it has drawers and it's
taking something out of one of

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-5
00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:43.936
those. He's opened a door in
there and he's taking something

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-6
00:36:43.936 --> 00:36:47.569
out and it looks like he is
holding an eggplant. He has a

1a44eed8-6ef3-455e-bf2b-85cc015272c6-7
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:51.140
big smile and he's offering it
to the man and the man is

1b90af0a-5a25-4995-9793-72d8b65507ba-0
00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.060
Smelling it.

b2e4d222-0078-483c-a3b4-207558153c37-0
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.630
To see if he maybe wants to buy
it.

fc6ddb99-5d5f-4996-b6d4-4a61182d0e70-0
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.740
And there's a little boy with a
holding a big empty basket. I

fc6ddb99-5d5f-4996-b6d4-4a61182d0e70-1
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.420
think they've managed to sell
all of their food.

aeff8d68-b483-4f99-9564-c9a4e7c8dd0a-0
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:03.620
OK.

50292fa4-428f-4e2a-959b-77d0f245d679-0
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:10.209
Another man with the glasses in
the white shirt and suspenders

50292fa4-428f-4e2a-959b-77d0f245d679-1
00:37:10.209 --> 00:37:12.120
is holding more food. Maybe.

13151c59-307f-4a01-8aee-f5f5ceccfe5c-0
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.330
I don't know, shrimp or
something. And the little boy is

ba8e97c0-6533-4dbf-ad76-bcd53a345763-0
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:26.470
is next to him, holding a horn
of some sort.

21adedd1-f442-4d61-b08e-3c87c82faf33-0
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.320
And he has a big smile on his
face.

6af98439-5617-41f0-82ae-adce97876a2e-0
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.517
He's also holding what looks
like a very large... the little

6af98439-5617-41f0-82ae-adce97876a2e-1
00:37:34.517 --> 00:37:38.094
boy is holding a very large
strawberry with a big smile on

6af98439-5617-41f0-82ae-adce97876a2e-2
00:37:38.094 --> 00:37:38.640
his face.

3266ebbb-a2e0-4c69-9608-2d3cfc832ca2-0
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:43.110
And the man with the white shirt
and suspenders is.

11a78382-b982-42f2-bf05-4a011dedd05a-0
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:49.625
Opening up a shell that has like
little tentacles coming out of

11a78382-b982-42f2-bf05-4a011dedd05a-1
00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:53.980
it. Now he's also holding what
looks like a snake,

adec7a58-ec45-452a-aeae-f4726ef86b4f-0
00:37:55.670 --> 00:38:01.119
I guess. He's holding a lot of
different objects and with his

adec7a58-ec45-452a-aeae-f4726ef86b4f-1
00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:01.910
thumb up.

40aeb98f-d617-461d-a736-982297ba9e19-0
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.241
Like whatever he's holding is a
good item to buy. Little boy is

40aeb98f-d617-461d-a736-982297ba9e19-1
00:38:08.241 --> 00:38:12.014
taking a bite out of the
strawberry and now the little

40aeb98f-d617-461d-a736-982297ba9e19-2
00:38:12.014 --> 00:38:16.200
boy is also feeding something to
that strange looking animal

40aeb98f-d617-461d-a736-982297ba9e19-3
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.670
that's been walking along with
the.

4a4b2a28-a479-4e1a-b70b-907cb00df87e-0
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.760
Man with a dark suit.

6e278ca6-1585-4bb0-b918-4a4a78c5d251-0
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.759
The little boy is telling the
man with the white shirt and

6e278ca6-1585-4bb0-b918-4a4a78c5d251-1
00:38:25.759 --> 00:38:26.780
suspenders a secret.

67815c95-22dc-4a7a-b584-777cdbf25a89-0
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.757
And now the man with the white
shirt and suspenders is talking

67815c95-22dc-4a7a-b584-777cdbf25a89-1
00:38:31.757 --> 00:38:35.889
to the man with the dark suit,
and the little boy is pointing

67815c95-22dc-4a7a-b584-777cdbf25a89-2
00:38:35.889 --> 00:38:40.086
somewhere else. And now they're
walking towards a lot of boats

67815c95-22dc-4a7a-b584-777cdbf25a89-3
00:38:40.086 --> 00:38:40.419
on...

13cb3a53-7695-45f3-970f-09fe81fd6639-0
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.752
Tied up to dry ground with
castles in the background.

13cb3a53-7695-45f3-970f-09fe81fd6639-1
00:38:43.752 --> 00:38:44.440
#END_arrival_4

508a4f24-9e76-4a83-b043-d99bb07d33db-0
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.320
OK. Wow.

1c161247-e802-409b-beec-5a85519e268d-0
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.180
I know there's like a lot there.

89cb16f6-2f78-455d-b465-b00e997a1edb-0
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.640
Let me see what we have next.

6b6aeac4-7236-479e-8f91-74e0a83fa763-0
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.442
It's hard to describe something.
You don't know what it is. Yeah,

6b6aeac4-7236-479e-8f91-74e0a83fa763-1
00:39:06.442 --> 00:39:07.190
you know.

2bd79bf3-7302-4ef0-b295-53eade0001a8-0
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.912
And maybe that's part of the
study is describe something you

2bd79bf3-7302-4ef0-b295-53eade0001a8-1
00:39:11.912 --> 00:39:13.040
don't really know.

d2d1543a-312b-4dd3-af6f-716fd007fa84-0
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.010
Let's see what's next for you.

6f48acff-da47-4772-8948-592996ab31a9-0
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.580
OK, got to go.

1abdd47b-b702-43a9-bbe6-1e8bdc0fed79-0
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:29.256
OK, I'm going to share my screen
and if you would you like to

1abdd47b-b702-43a9-bbe6-1e8bdc0fed79-1
00:39:29.256 --> 00:39:31.660
take a break, like a 3 minute
break.

0e57b01f-e4a1-4132-9326-7f0576be4ea1-0
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.402
I'm good. I have something to
drink here. If if you're good,

0e57b01f-e4a1-4132-9326-7f0576be4ea1-1
00:39:36.402 --> 00:39:37.230
I'm good, OK.

d7e8b296-d327-4f47-95cb-a08495d92604-0
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.560
Wow.

23ab3794-529d-47cd-ab2b-57ae6166a540-0
00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.219
OK, so when you're ready, you
could be just describing it

23ab3794-529d-47cd-ab2b-57ae6166a540-1
00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:50.860
again. Yep, this is another
complex scene, like some of the

23ab3794-529d-47cd-ab2b-57ae6166a540-2
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.320
ones we were seeing before. So
not a story, not a story.

57851193-b515-48dc-a0dc-1db770228ee8-0
00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.982
#START_being_a_pirate OK, so now
we're looking at a large lake,

57851193-b515-48dc-a0dc-1db770228ee8-1
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:03.290
or perhaps a sea or the ocean.

5ef54417-efbb-41af-8b55-70b92112bf5b-0
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.469
And along the edge of the water
there is some land. They must be

5ef54417-efbb-41af-8b55-70b92112bf5b-1
00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:15.010
in a tropical area because there
are a lot of palm trees.

de0a5aa8-5f31-4840-b00b-98deefdd3eb4-0
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.380
There is a tall Cliff.

b0583554-b8a6-403f-a1b5-63419f6538d6-0
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.810
At one end.

7dfa9f40-8d56-4022-ae4c-01c11c2d0287-0
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.720
Of the land with palm trees on
the top.

d87f80a4-9688-4ca1-a9d9-822bac7d6398-0
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.070
Along the land there are people.

c7c7cdd0-5811-4fde-95f8-790bf42e7bc2-0
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.510
Looking out over the water.

ecfd07ad-c8e6-4666-b14d-5027d72f90d3-0
00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.606
There's another group who's
getting ready to launch a wooden

ecfd07ad-c8e6-4666-b14d-5027d72f90d3-1
00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:36.730
boat into the water.

c68efd56-24fd-4ff9-b2b0-ddd761e53b9e-0
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.430
There are.

5c7174b2-ba9f-412b-b4ec-9c0facf47d07-0
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.565
People looks like they're
protecting the land. Maybe they

5c7174b2-ba9f-412b-b4ec-9c0facf47d07-1
00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:45.320
are holding.

a7aa0155-8508-4e91-bc7b-1f2788d30a1b-0
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.110
Rifles or guns?

2b582c43-baf1-43db-a98c-4c668578b8f8-0
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.853
And there's another group that's
looking looks like they're

2b582c43-baf1-43db-a98c-4c668578b8f8-1
00:40:52.853 --> 00:40:56.437
looking into a treasure chest,
but the treasure chest looks to

2b582c43-baf1-43db-a98c-4c668578b8f8-2
00:40:56.437 --> 00:40:56.950
be empty.

b79580b1-ee68-49be-a206-866910674e4c-0
00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:03.428
So out in the water there is a
very large pirate ship, and the

b79580b1-ee68-49be-a206-866910674e4c-1
00:41:03.428 --> 00:41:04.690
pirate ship is.

5a482e3d-dc30-4e5f-b02c-a31c13a10553-0
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.390
Wooden.

fdbae588-a512-44e8-9574-eb812d1dfa3c-0
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.650
And has.

3cfc0fcf-e653-4054-8d3c-d25776bb85cc-0
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.480
Three different.

c8ec7d11-c08e-41c0-953b-401839ea44c1-0
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:17.781
Masts that have sails on them,
but the sails are are wrapped up

c8ec7d11-c08e-41c0-953b-401839ea44c1-1
00:41:17.781 --> 00:41:21.520
so the sails are not out. You
can't see them.

37e50fda-5110-4d18-9aec-56c9b0bfee05-0
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.354
But there's people climbing all
over the boat. Way up on the top

37e50fda-5110-4d18-9aec-56c9b0bfee05-1
00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:28.150
there are.

0300c4eb-4541-47e2-a9b4-a14d1f35d836-0
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.374
People who looks like they're
trying to push some people off

0300c4eb-4541-47e2-a9b4-a14d1f35d836-1
00:41:34.374 --> 00:41:34.980
the top.

95c2a944-e61b-471f-8edc-dd8818ed7abf-0
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.118
There's a somebody with a blue
and white striped shirt who's

95c2a944-e61b-471f-8edc-dd8818ed7abf-1
00:41:41.118 --> 00:41:45.681
falling off the top of it. It
looks like there's people who

95c2a944-e61b-471f-8edc-dd8818ed7abf-2
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:47.050
might be fighting.

00a7d6ce-d1fd-4801-97a7-7d87d1b07b96-0
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:52.307
It's a pirate ship, so there's
probably pirates and there's

00a7d6ce-d1fd-4801-97a7-7d87d1b07b96-1
00:41:52.307 --> 00:41:55.600
probably people who are trying
to take over the ship.

9269ff12-e568-4385-8d3d-4c2a092908a3-0
00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:03.161
There is a there are blue and
white flags on the pirate ship.

9269ff12-e568-4385-8d3d-4c2a092908a3-1
00:42:03.161 --> 00:42:05.280
There are rope ladders.

cede25c5-536c-43ff-a420-60ff243371d2-0
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.596
1234567 at least eight rope
ladders with people climbing up

cede25c5-536c-43ff-a420-60ff243371d2-1
00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:13.710
and down the rope ladders.

9f311cfd-b021-4acd-a83e-a37109961fb3-0
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.120
Trying to get off or trying to
get up to the top.

81936dfc-e208-4719-ab06-61422371de6d-0
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.060
Um.

b4a36f92-dc7f-4a26-ba11-5a1b250ac3ce-0
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.130
There.

2c7315f2-c4e2-4e4f-8d14-7c0b503ac917-0
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:31.285
It looks like there are cannons
and they are shooting cannons,

2c7315f2-c4e2-4e4f-8d14-7c0b503ac917-1
00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:36.109
the black cannons, and they have
big white puffs of smoke coming

2c7315f2-c4e2-4e4f-8d14-7c0b503ac917-2
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:37.000
out of them.

7cd933df-743c-4d00-871c-9e37e098f022-0
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:42.554
So the pirate ship is shooting
cannons out at other boats, but

7cd933df-743c-4d00-871c-9e37e098f022-1
00:42:42.554 --> 00:42:47.283
there are other smaller boats
who are shooting cannons at the

7cd933df-743c-4d00-871c-9e37e098f022-2
00:42:47.283 --> 00:42:50.410
big boat, so around the big
pirate ship.

886dc46c-0ce7-4aa5-b7d8-cde4dec853c1-0
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:56.713
There are a lot of small wooden
row boats that are full of

886dc46c-0ce7-4aa5-b7d8-cde4dec853c1-1
00:42:56.713 --> 00:43:02.207
people. They are rowing to and
from the large pirate ship.

886dc46c-0ce7-4aa5-b7d8-cde4dec853c1-2
00:43:02.207 --> 00:43:07.887
There's a couple wooden row
boats that have sunk and there's

886dc46c-0ce7-4aa5-b7d8-cde4dec853c1-3
00:43:07.887 --> 00:43:09.750
people in the water.

9685daf5-308d-4a84-a426-b425c8c8da53-0
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.490
Raising up their hands for help.

73c6adff-5304-4b31-b1d3-7f53311e69ea-0
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:15.660
There.

df34093d-49e6-4448-81a7-0518ec9747ca-0
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:22.970
Are people saving other people.
So there's a boat that has some

df34093d-49e6-4448-81a7-0518ec9747ca-1
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.360
men in it who have the blue.

d26aeb97-c930-4ae0-bb49-f5ba03ef69a5-0
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.579
Striped shirts on and they are
grabbing people who are in the

d26aeb97-c930-4ae0-bb49-f5ba03ef69a5-1
00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:35.008
water. There's someone with a
red shirt that they're trying to

d26aeb97-c930-4ae0-bb49-f5ba03ef69a5-2
00:43:35.008 --> 00:43:35.360
save.

4f447692-6b8f-4177-80e9-3d750d3d2a8a-0
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.560
And someone else with a blue
hat.

aa874d8a-20dc-48f2-8c06-cb262b42a4d2-0
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.390
There's also a large octopus in
the water.

d22bda88-45cd-41a9-a3cb-84923640a00a-0
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.187
That octopus is giant. It's as
big as some of the small wooden

d22bda88-45cd-41a9-a3cb-84923640a00a-1
00:43:50.187 --> 00:43:54.594
row boats, and the octopus has
grabbed some of the people with

d22bda88-45cd-41a9-a3cb-84923640a00a-2
00:43:54.594 --> 00:43:58.442
its tentacles and has its
tentacles wrapped around the

d22bda88-45cd-41a9-a3cb-84923640a00a-3
00:43:58.442 --> 00:44:02.780
people who are flailing their
arms and legs, asking for help.

6a08be98-9e3e-4e6e-996f-f43ffaa0c911-0
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:06.160
There.

1ed19bbe-74ed-4da1-ba7a-dbc1ad50a2aa-0
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.570
Is someone.

a7530b20-d20a-415c-928f-b37be49fd1fb-0
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.000
Who looks like they're in a
small.

e90d236d-758c-4f61-8460-35179507c34a-0
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.430
Rowboat. But I think the rowboat
actually looks like a bathtub.

4cc74a33-b601-4a92-b527-5baa954103a8-0
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.200
And the man is sitting in water
in the bathtub.

355d2dea-e564-4458-92f0-bea1abaed523-0
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:24.610
In the water.

edbe272e-c822-40d1-883f-024e2927f80b-0
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.530
Well, there's a pirate.

8894b43b-a4ac-42c8-bc8f-0e0c660e5b7a-0
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.860
These take taking place.

afe8dea0-cdd1-4c69-a101-22d0ddc7e47d-0
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:38.062
There are pirate flags. There's
another ship that's smaller than

afe8dea0-cdd1-4c69-a101-22d0ddc7e47d-1
00:44:38.062 --> 00:44:42.905
the large pirate ship, but it's
still a pretty good sized pirate

afe8dea0-cdd1-4c69-a101-22d0ddc7e47d-2
00:44:42.905 --> 00:44:45.960
ship with pirate flags on it and
people.

0dd76bb5-1c3f-4e14-bcc6-0347b6818ef5-0
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.293
Oh, there's somebody walking the
plank, so there's a pirate with

0dd76bb5-1c3f-4e14-bcc6-0347b6818ef5-1
00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:51.760
a sword.

aa9fe59a-3486-4dbf-95f2-5faeda895510-0
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.590
Walking someone out on the front
of the ship.

af7373c3-7b2b-4dc0-9508-93d02cdca720-0
00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:59.940
And that person has the blue
stripe shirt and pants on.

10b48bbf-9405-4431-a47b-79b533bc42a0-0
00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.240
And is on the edge of the.

957a2f3f-4717-4205-897a-888faa28e3c3-0
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.420
Plank. #END_being_a_pirate

5be5d9b0-02a2-45a2-9f74-2e050f4f373f-0
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:05.280
OK.

89d3467e-6662-48e5-ad28-3cbb77f613cc-0
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.880
Perfect. Go on forever.

25935e66-8edc-4405-ab29-2360c017652a-0
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.400
I know there is so much. Let's
see what we have next.

099d57a9-c7d0-4466-a40a-9c7a134b5fba-0
00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:20.255
I'm talking too long. Ohh here.
Good. I've I've been keeping

099d57a9-c7d0-4466-a40a-9c7a134b5fba-1
00:45:20.255 --> 00:45:24.870
track and trying to share. So
OK, so now we're going to have

099d57a9-c7d0-4466-a40a-9c7a134b5fba-2
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:25.929
another story.

6d1ba5f2-fe48-48ca-b59b-6edfa964f723-0
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.470
Let's go.

75d84f81-204b-477c-ab84-48acbe12c48c-0
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:40.050
OK.

07d0309d-cdbe-4132-87f4-aec78bdb7309-0
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:48.552
So this is a story and it's
three slides. So just tell the

07d0309d-cdbe-4132-87f4-aec78bdb7309-1
00:45:48.552 --> 00:45:49.290
story.

c83fea8f-e116-4ee4-bae6-8a16124f4305-0
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.863
Tell me when you would like me
to move on. There are three

c83fea8f-e116-4ee4-bae6-8a16124f4305-1
00:45:54.863 --> 00:45:56.350
slides to the story.

7ecb2dd6-62d3-4ab7-b85e-a9cc4a1b39e8-0
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.380
#START_arrival_2 So this story
starts with.

b7eae3e4-0e11-4e8f-9dac-da526b364f73-0
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.730
A couple people sitting with
some suitcases.

6ab0c6ca-8787-44ee-a10d-ab2338dfa1f4-0
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:15.736
And they have a white covering
over their head. Looks like

6ab0c6ca-8787-44ee-a10d-ab2338dfa1f4-1
00:46:15.736 --> 00:46:20.844
they're just waiting. And
there's also a group of men in

6ab0c6ca-8787-44ee-a10d-ab2338dfa1f4-2
00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:25.593
dark suits and dark hats and
looks like suitcases or

6ab0c6ca-8787-44ee-a10d-ab2338dfa1f4-3
00:46:25.593 --> 00:46:26.400
packages.

84670f15-ee88-4259-85dd-570d28ed4572-0
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.430
There's also a woman holding a
baby.

dc5ced4f-2ad3-466a-8128-4eac4a8af93b-0
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.429
The man with the dark suit and
hat is now writing in a book.

dc5ced4f-2ad3-466a-8128-4eac4a8af93b-1
00:46:36.429 --> 00:46:41.094
Looks like he's sitting on a
bench or his suitcase while he's

dc5ced4f-2ad3-466a-8128-4eac4a8af93b-2
00:46:41.094 --> 00:46:44.480
waiting, he's writing something
in his book.

9eac0403-e771-47d6-8a44-9412e74cd2cc-0
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.673
He's ripping a page out of the
book that he just wrote on and

9eac0403-e771-47d6-8a44-9412e74cd2cc-1
00:46:50.673 --> 00:46:52.320
he's folding it up.

0b745b77-244d-4d09-a076-e9645461603c-0
00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.810
Into an origami bird.

f9ddc24f-3a46-44dd-92d2-de42e9d87e34-0
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.360
And he's holding it.

e5340f1e-e055-48ce-b23c-e156824c32c4-0
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:03.820
Holding it by the tip of his
fingers, looking at the origami

e5340f1e-e055-48ce-b23c-e156824c32c4-1
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:08.562
bird and it looks like the bird
has now come to life and the man

e5340f1e-e055-48ce-b23c-e156824c32c4-2
00:47:08.562 --> 00:47:10.240
is watching it fly off.

a490ab3f-b174-4518-9d61-018b7a96a0e5-0
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:16.728
And he's got his hand up to his
hat watching the bird fly off.

a490ab3f-b174-4518-9d61-018b7a96a0e5-1
00:47:16.728 --> 00:47:22.446

are flying in the sky above a
large ship with smokestacks, or

a490ab3f-b174-4518-9d61-018b7a96a0e5-3
00:47:27.985 --> 00:47:33.346
maybe they're called gunnels
smokestacks. And on the on the

a490ab3f-b174-4518-9d61-018b7a96a0e5-4
00:47:33.346 --> 00:47:39.064

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.613
And now we're still on the ship
with all of the people, and it

00:47:52.613 --> 00:47:57.200
looks like the origami birds
have flown way off in the

dce9d81f-7039-451e-8c7f-581d0c6bb051-2
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.870

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:16.518
But by the big ship are a lot of
other smaller ships and medium

621abaf4-18da-4b60-8610-ef2cc172f39c-1
00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:21.080

00:49:31.897 --> 00:49:36.058
smaller ships around it. In the
sky it's very cloudy, but

00:49:36.058 --> 00:49:40.364
between the clouds you can see
the sun shining through very

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.550
His old antique watch.

05674811-a1b6-4c9c-9c7d-c27ed4f993ad-0
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:24.000
Umm.

3e9f4c3d-6427-47e0-85bc-99299635025e-0
00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:28.030
And he's.

98ea5fb8-800b-494a-9f82-42647a19a529-0
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.242
Looking at his watch, but
looking off in the distance

98ea5fb8-800b-494a-9f82-42647a19a529-1
00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:32.500
also.

01e83714-9465-49ba-8b31-7782d933294e-0
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:38.480
He's now walking down the street
with his suitcase, walking by

01e83714-9465-49ba-8b31-7782d933294e-1
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.290
some buildings with some strange
lettering on it.

f9028e6f-ac20-475e-822d-57ed4774de7e-0
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.036
The buildings also have big
doors with archways on them, and

f9028e6f-ac20-475e-822d-57ed4774de7e-1
00:54:47.036 --> 00:54:49.230
no one else is around him right
now.

74ba9412-9727-4b69-8db5-353bde05c2ec-0
00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.810
He's looking up in the sky.

32d38b5f-4d47-4112-ae55-525d98eea287-0
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:57.737
At what looks to be lights that
are round circle lights that are

32d38b5f-4d47-4112-ae55-525d98eea287-1
00:54:57.737 --> 00:55:02.677
floating in the sky like hail,
but they're lights, they're lit

32d38b5f-4d47-4112-ae55-525d98eea287-2
00:55:02.677 --> 00:55:06.990
up and now they're kind of
raining down on him and his

32d38b5f-4d47-4112-ae55-525d98eea287-3
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:11.852
hat's flying off. So his hat
flew down on the ground and he's

32d38b5f-4d47-4112-ae55-525d98eea287-4
00:55:11.852 --> 00:55:16.636
picked it up and put it back on
his head. I think that's his

32d38b5f-4d47-4112-ae55-525d98eea287-5
00:55:16.636 --> 00:55:21.419
map. He has his map again and
he's now crouched down on the.

67f4a591-9fa8-4f38-be8c-f8fb461c187a-0
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:26.264
I think the sidewalk actually
has a big map on it. He's

67f4a591-9fa8-4f38-be8c-f8fb461c187a-1
00:55:26.264 --> 00:55:29.363
crouched down on the sidewalk
with his suitcase, reading

67f4a591-9fa8-4f38-be8c-f8fb461c187a-2
00:55:29.363 --> 00:55:30.559
something in his book.

2a5449cd-7698-4d47-a453-f84d5d450c79-0
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.290
Someone has come up to him and
he's a little startled.

15506eea-aed6-407a-95bb-ba620008784d-0
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:36.640
But the man

225dc0d3-d547-499f-bcac-b7c868fea326-0
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:43.203
Is reaching out his hand, and
this man has a white turban kind

225dc0d3-d547-499f-bcac-b7c868fea326-1
00:55:43.203 --> 00:55:47.941
of hat with a white cloak, and
the man with the dark suit is

225dc0d3-d547-499f-bcac-b7c868fea326-2
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:52.291
asking him a question and the
man in the white cloak is

225dc0d3-d547-499f-bcac-b7c868fea326-3
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:53.690
thinking about it.

bb00d279-50a7-4536-bb29-19638f7d73de-0
00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:59.523
And now he is telling him
something, gesturing with his

bb00d279-50a7-4536-bb29-19638f7d73de-1
00:55:59.523 --> 00:55:59.980
hands.

88a5eebf-837b-4a36-8e65-ac7ae162b7eb-0
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.494
The man in the dark suit is
drawing something in his book

88a5eebf-837b-4a36-8e65-ac7ae162b7eb-1
00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:08.724
and showing it to the other man,
and the picture is a bed with a

88a5eebf-837b-4a36-8e65-ac7ae162b7eb-2
00:56:08.724 --> 00:56:09.180
window.

9bcd9c66-6566-46ac-b0bb-effe3af020c3-0
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:13.447
And the man in the white cloak
now knows what he's talking

9bcd9c66-6566-46ac-b0bb-effe3af020c3-1
00:56:13.447 --> 00:56:14.220
about. So he's

2d855a36-192d-461d-b06c-2111795e00c5-0
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:20.215
gesturing for him to follow him.
So the man in the dark suit is

2d855a36-192d-461d-b06c-2111795e00c5-1
00:56:20.215 --> 00:56:24.166
following the man in the white
cloak. The man in the white

2d855a36-192d-461d-b06c-2111795e00c5-2
00:56:24.166 --> 00:56:25.840
cloak has a like backpack

d2bb9fe8-3594-4106-b895-875917753cee-0
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:30.454
kind of on him that has a
strange looking animal in it.

d2bb9fe8-3594-4106-b895-875917753cee-1
00:56:30.454 --> 00:56:31.420

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.263
Yeah, can't wait. My husband can
hear me talking. I can't wait to

c1b264ad-9bad-439c-a109-821916e30323-1
00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.930
ask him later. Could you picture
what I was saying?

a5b7b28f-3f5b-4770-b309-b2e7e31a4713-0
00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:48.100
OK, let's see what we have next.

cc61ba34-c648-4dad-a85a-845ab91c4aba-0

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:18.270
If I can find it.

And then?

oh, ancient Rome in a big
Colosseum. So the

There are a number of lions. The
Lions are already in the arena

a440f8a4-3383-4847-884d-8033760cf078-1
00:58:34.904 --> 00:58:38.914

Whips. There's a person with a
whip is I supposed to control

6278d618-909f-4e5e-8881-222044c34c3f-1
00:58:51.144 --> 00:58:55.259
the lion if he gets out of
control, there's other people

6278d618-909f-4e5e-8881-222044c34c3f-2
00:58:55.259 --> 00:58:57.570

A chariot with.

0b54f3b2-86f9-41ae-b7ce-46a9d2a91cab-0
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:10.200
Four horses.

Pulling a chariot and the man
who was standing in the chariot

0d7389fd-b7aa-47cc-9f80-0daa86772cb2-1
00:59:19.893 --> 00:59:23.999
looks like he fell out and he's
holding on with one arm and

0d7389fd-b7aa-47cc-9f80-0daa86772cb2-2
00:59:23.999 --> 00:59:28.380
being kind of dragged behind the
chariot. He's wearing a green.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.650
I suppose wooden wheels and the
chariot is white and.

There's another chariot.

4495121f-008e-43d3-9bed-522926b20752-0

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:46.550
swords.

65ea4e5b-7597-4664-b9cb-bc0633406633-0
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:48.160
There.

35322ad4-7c72-4cf4-98ee-5f4662e96338-0
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:51.320
are

0d9408ad-63e6-4f33-b1f7-45fd54bed209-0
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:54.790
Goodness.

6477066c-f749-4dd7-a2ba-31850abe344e-0
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.890
Let's see. Oh, there's actually
a stack of lions.

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-0
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.628
There's a bunch of lions who
have formed a pyramid along the

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-1
01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:08.602
back wall of the arena, and the
lions are escaping. So they're

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-2
01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:12.387
climbing up to the top of the
pyramid and climbing over the

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-3
01:01:12.387 --> 01:01:16.361
wall, and as they climb over the
wall, they're scaring all the

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-4
01:01:16.361 --> 01:01:20.020
people who are sitting there
watching, and the people are

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-5
01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:23.616
scattering. The people are
wearing all different colored

d6370eeb-79b6-4ff5-b3df-117b1908db9a-6
01:01:23.616 --> 01:01:25.320
outfits, yellow, blue, red.

26f0da07-554b-4aa4-b8c3-1a1e29a08969-0
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:29.780
And they're running as fast as
they can away from the lions.

fe06a06f-86e1-4285-8e5c-082cabec55e5-0
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.360
There's also another.

f565e32b-2ec8-4df7-9daf-363260082e4d-0
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.700
Area of the wall where there's a
lion.

22cec4c4-7279-4b51-9694-48577aa0da4e-0
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:43.663
Leaning up against the wall as
some people are escaping up a

22cec4c4-7279-4b51-9694-48577aa0da4e-1
01:01:43.663 --> 01:01:45.660
rope up and over the wall.

1f40b970-3551-4c96-b32c-2f4b9725a1ab-0
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.120
They are getting away from the
lion.

4641fa6e-011f-4984-aa81-001bea2c1b72-0
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.652
So another group of people who
have formed not really a

4641fa6e-011f-4984-aa81-001bea2c1b72-1
01:01:55.652 --> 01:01:59.176
pyramid, but there's a man on
the bottom with another man

4641fa6e-011f-4984-aa81-001bea2c1b72-2
01:01:59.176 --> 01:02:02.883
standing on top of him, and a
man on top of him, and another

4641fa6e-011f-4984-aa81-001bea2c1b72-3
01:02:02.883 --> 01:02:06.347
man on top of him so that they
can escape over the wall.

4641fa6e-011f-4984-aa81-001bea2c1b72-4
01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:07.380

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:11.990
Time up.

cbda7f29-c645-4c29-a4a5-1b12b01d10a9-0
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.230
Yep, you're good.

75bb2da9-e2c3-438d-b6cd-cff3990ea775-0
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.104
You could just go on and on.
There's so much in these

75bb2da9-e2c3-438d-b6cd-cff3990ea775-1
01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:22.490
pictures. Let's see what's next.

26fd169a-a74d-47de-9ffb-4bd36c32f7b5-0
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:35.380
The horse and the chariot was so
funny, yes.

e100ebff-dbb3-4bae-b5c4-ece766c738f9-0
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.730
OK, next we have.

f6d05f13-865f-4d5f-be21-a5fdacd499f0-0
01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.540
OK. And I will.

ddffa89b-42ed-4fbd-80fd-cb8076b86b69-0
01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:55.870
So this is another.

9afabf08-4cd8-4b4c-a838-9099136f9439-0
01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.729
Short story, it's five slides.
You could let me know when to

9afabf08-4cd8-4b4c-a838-9099136f9439-1
01:03:01.729 --> 01:03:05.710
move on from each slide and I
will share my screen.

6468f175-2a8e-414c-953b-d45c6d9daac9-0
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.290
Five slides.

ad5b61f8-e1d0-4e34-a006-6b67475048dd-0
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:20.528
Am I giving too much detail or
this is OK? Yeah, this is what

ad5b61f8-e1d0-4e34-a006-6b67475048dd-1
01:03:20.528 --> 01:03:21.800
we're looking for.

8f3af5c0-b387-4b3a-9510-5975c5cae44c-0
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.820
OK, so you could begin when
you're ready.

78929aad-4653-42e0-922b-c431bb270e83-0
01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.610
#START_arrival_1 OK, the story
begins with a.

181e0975-e739-4a2b-b836-b36c53eb40d9-0
01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.892
Picture with a frame around it
and it looks to be a man and a

181e0975-e739-4a2b-b836-b36c53eb40d9-1
01:03:34.892 --> 01:03:36.150
woman and a child.

f7137659-03e4-4e23-bbc4-e018035d0118-0
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:41.155
The child is in a white dress,
the man's in a dark suit, and

f7137659-03e4-4e23-bbc4-e018035d0118-1
01:03:41.155 --> 01:03:45.521
the woman has a dark skirt with
a white blouse. Now someone's

f7137659-03e4-4e23-bbc4-e018035d0118-2
01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:49.535
picking up the picture and
wrapping it carefully in some

f7137659-03e4-4e23-bbc4-e018035d0118-3
01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:51.930
white fabric and tying it with
a.

a5c9a181-8648-4507-a63b-de7f1fadc1d0-0
01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:58.413
With some string, they've tied
it up and they've put it inside

a5c9a181-8648-4507-a63b-de7f1fadc1d0-1
01:03:58.413 --> 01:04:00.730
of a suitcase or a briefcase.

ad9ca5f7-e4d5-4530-a68c-745b207755dc-0
01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.566
And the probably the suitcase.
And the suitcase has a belt

ad9ca5f7-e4d5-4530-a68c-745b207755dc-1
01:04:07.566 --> 01:04:10.610
around it to secure it closed.

2c1ebcda-445e-4a8a-97ba-5735941993e9-0
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.870
OK.

f9a290de-dad8-44d3-be82-d0cb3196438e-0
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.330
And now we see the origami bird
again.

af2ee1b5-e7e1-4fca-bd8a-42425978410b-0
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:25.916
In one picture. And another
picture of a mantle clock and

af2ee1b5-e7e1-4fca-bd8a-42425978410b-1
01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:31.833
it's the time is 10 after 10,
and hanging on the wall is a

af2ee1b5-e7e1-4fca-bd8a-42425978410b-2
01:04:31.833 --> 01:04:37.649
dark hat, a man's hat with a
white towel. There's also a.

95b4ea68-fc6c-4f30-a643-a063ed793595-0
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.190
kettle with a spoon.

e1dba851-5756-4f39-a4ae-c50cc5125542-0
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.099
And there's also a picture that
has a hand-drawn picture of a

e1dba851-5756-4f39-a4ae-c50cc5125542-1
01:04:48.099 --> 01:04:53.478
man in a hat with a woman and a
child. And the sun is shining

e1dba851-5756-4f39-a4ae-c50cc5125542-2
01:04:53.478 --> 01:04:54.520
and there's.

e4f19ee2-4da5-4692-8ccd-840b08180529-0
01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.790
Birds flying and there's a bird
on the man's arm.

89f2ab43-0151-4c02-8479-32cc13beeda0-0
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.090
There's also a tea kettle.

778d912f-2f3d-4e7d-95cd-4efd382062b9-0
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:07.190
And a cup and saucer.

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-0
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:12.840
And open suitcase. And again a
picture with a man and a woman

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-1
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.494
and a child. Now all of those
individual pictures are also

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-2
01:05:17.494 --> 01:05:21.833
showing in a larger picture. So
in the larger picture,

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-3
01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:26.960
everything is showing together.
The origami bird, a shelf at the

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-4
01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.851
top with with bottles and the
mantle clock and clock is still

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-5
01:05:31.851 --> 01:05:36.742
showing 10 after 10. And on the
wall is hanging the man's hat

f54766c7-39a9-4150-b964-c37a900fafba-6
01:05:36.742 --> 01:05:38.319
and the white towel.

3cb5bd2e-e76f-4cd9-96fe-3d6216ca04ec-0
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:41.840
And the hand-drawn picture that
we saw.

21c411fa-f361-43b9-aba4-e1c56fa7206c-0
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:48.217
There's a wood table with three
wood chairs and on the table are

21c411fa-f361-43b9-aba4-e1c56fa7206c-1
01:05:48.217 --> 01:05:50.240
our cups and saucers with.

4dc0a7f6-f42b-465a-9876-36bd82aa0a7a-0
01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.976
Maybe tea in them and a teapot
and the suitcase that we saw

4dc0a7f6-f42b-465a-9876-36bd82aa0a7a-1
01:05:56.976 --> 01:06:02.205
earlier that has the leather
strap around it and there's a

4dc0a7f6-f42b-465a-9876-36bd82aa0a7a-2
01:06:02.205 --> 01:06:03.180
man with a.

b24bc3e0-21b1-4bc0-b08f-c94870ef674c-0
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:08.466
Dark suit. He has dark pants and
a dark vest and a white shirt,

b24bc3e0-21b1-4bc0-b08f-c94870ef674c-1
01:06:08.466 --> 01:06:13.033
and the woman has a white dress
and they have their hands on top

b24bc3e0-21b1-4bc0-b08f-c94870ef674c-2
01:06:13.033 --> 01:06:17.460
of the suitcase and she has her
hand on top of the man's hand.

35332d87-d5be-43b1-8446-24253e9d1021-0
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:20.810
OK.

10f5e426-338e-435a-b425-55529b4fb477-0
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.906
And now we see the little girl,
and the little girl is sleeping,

10f5e426-338e-435a-b425-55529b4fb477-1
01:06:28.906 --> 01:06:32.992
but now she's waking up and
yawning and she's sitting up in

10f5e426-338e-435a-b425-55529b4fb477-2
01:06:32.992 --> 01:06:37.215
in probably in bed with some
blankets yawning and rubbing her

10f5e426-338e-435a-b425-55529b4fb477-3
01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:41.301
eyes. Now she's eating something
out of a white bowl with a

10f5e426-338e-435a-b425-55529b4fb477-4
01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:41.709
spoon.

05c3658d-46d8-4ea0-8eb9-97fa6f9f9afc-0
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:46.830
And she is sitting at the wood
table.

2029c50f-eb05-430e-8fd3-dc309600c35a-0
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:51.610
We also see the same suitcase
with the strap around it.

2029c50f-eb05-430e-8fd3-dc309600c35a-1
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:55.320
There's the man in the dark suit
putting on his hat.

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-0
01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.462
And then the woman is putting on
a white cloth over her head

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-1
01:07:00.462 --> 01:07:04.825
scarf, and the little girl is
getting dressed with a hat and

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-2
01:07:04.825 --> 01:07:09.546
jacket and putting on boots. And
now the little girl is trying to

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-3
01:07:09.546 --> 01:07:14.124
lift up the suitcase and hand it
to the man with the dark suit,

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-4
01:07:14.124 --> 01:07:18.701
and the man has taken it in his
hand. And now all three of them

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-5
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:22.993
are walking down the sidewalk
and street outside of a large

1912337b-4d35-403b-8b80-e3e6f331d7d6-6
01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:27.070
building on the building is a
shadow of what looks like.

f4337a83-3856-48b4-8de3-5c3765d7753f-0
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:29.240
A Dragon's tail.

e51618b3-4be0-40c7-8d03-ae44156643bb-0
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:31.720
Very large dragon tail.

404d639b-e8d9-48c9-a55f-f189775b6558-0
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:38.516
So now the little girl is
looking up in the sky, holding

404d639b-e8d9-48c9-a55f-f189775b6558-1
01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:38.940
hands.

f860da91-4e32-459e-b301-acf7c7323ea4-0
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.700
With maybe both the man on one
side and the woman on the other,

f860da91-4e32-459e-b301-acf7c7323ea4-1
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.340
and they're at a train.

7a858fa4-a447-4a7c-bd88-45f89b7a9980-0
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:52.186
Depot. A train is just coming
into the station with Big Black

7a858fa4-a447-4a7c-bd88-45f89b7a9980-1
01:07:52.186 --> 01:07:56.846
smoke coming out of it and a lot
of people are are waiting

7a858fa4-a447-4a7c-bd88-45f89b7a9980-2
01:07:56.846 --> 01:07:59.690
alongside the train with
suitcases.

bc4fd001-0d19-470b-afc3-35af98d76063-0
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:01.890
Um.

692c93a7-75b2-446f-8fe8-f79605a069d2-0
01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.630
The man has taken off his hat
and there's the one of the

692c93a7-75b2-446f-8fe8-f79605a069d2-1
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:12.536
origami birds is on his head and
he's taken it in his hands and

692c93a7-75b2-446f-8fe8-f79605a069d2-2
01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:14.760
handed it to the little girl.

9bfefc1a-496b-4d88-85f4-236cc5ae61f4-0
01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:19.758
And the little girls taking the
origami bird and is holding it.

9bfefc1a-496b-4d88-85f4-236cc5ae61f4-1
01:08:19.758 --> 01:08:23.842
And she's hugged the man in the
dark. She's hugging the man in

9bfefc1a-496b-4d88-85f4-236cc5ae61f4-2
01:08:23.842 --> 01:08:24.750
the dark suit.

ca1983f1-a6f3-452d-a1a5-7ca601aff417-0
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.938
The woman with the white scarf
over her head is crying and

ca1983f1-a6f3-452d-a1a5-7ca601aff417-1
01:08:30.938 --> 01:08:36.340
dabbing a handkerchief to her to
her eyes and hugging the man.

edd0e77f-c7a7-49b9-9675-93a565ba4a28-0
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.420
Probably goodbye.

1fc48006-149e-4770-8e14-c06792aaa8df-0
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:42.995
And now the man is whispering
something in the man in the

1fc48006-149e-4770-8e14-c06792aaa8df-1
01:08:42.995 --> 01:08:44.900
woman's ear and holding her.

c1c769f8-4236-4e16-8f8d-1c540b77e422-0
01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:51.284
The man is now stepping on to
the train and he has the

c1c769f8-4236-4e16-8f8d-1c540b77e422-1
01:08:51.284 --> 01:08:55.561
suitcase with him. He's reached
his hand outside of the train

c1c769f8-4236-4e16-8f8d-1c540b77e422-2
01:08:55.561 --> 01:08:59.770
car and the woman and the little
girl have grabbed his hand.

3a8be745-5ad3-41de-a698-dbd9bf10bc26-0
01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.100
And now it's the train is going
away.

4edcad9c-c584-4831-8163-d21670816a4a-0
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.170
They're

84921028-b6ed-490b-912c-104935f5f4aa-0
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.165
They can't hold hands anymore
and the train is traveling away

84921028-b6ed-490b-912c-104935f5f4aa-1
01:09:09.165 --> 01:09:10.930
with black smoke coming out of
it.

e7d1ca65-22c5-41b4-b6f6-aa5832988953-0
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.542
So now we're back looking at the
picture with the frame, with the

e7d1ca65-22c5-41b4-b6f6-aa5832988953-1
01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:22.925
man and the woman and the little
girl, and they're all smiling in

e7d1ca65-22c5-41b4-b6f6-aa5832988953-2
01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:23.540
the picture.

6f5e90eb-5e01-4c2a-b50c-9c53f3f7bf75-0
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:29.350
And there is looks to be the
man.

bfab61ef-8096-4815-b93a-f00418c94dfd-0
01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:35.347
Eating something out of a white
bowl with a spoon and he's

bfab61ef-8096-4815-b93a-f00418c94dfd-1
01:09:35.347 --> 01:09:39.170
looking at the picture with the
man, the woman and the child.

8a73190c-54a7-45b9-bfc9-3f191d848666-0
01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.040
Now he's looking out of a
porthole and the porthole is

8a73190c-54a7-45b9-bfc9-3f191d848666-1
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.450
actually on a very large ocean
liner ship.

dc6bf5d2-e2ef-4c30-a658-64ca5f657fce-0
01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:53.438
And the ocean liner has rows of
lit up portholes. There are

dc6bf5d2-e2ef-4c30-a658-64ca5f657fce-1
01:09:53.438 --> 01:09:57.410
three smokestacks with smoke
coming out of the top of the

dc6bf5d2-e2ef-4c30-a658-64ca5f657fce-2
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:59.260
ocean liner. #END_arrival_1

1989f7af-e6b3-410e-945c-452cfebbf6f2-0
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.590
Hey, I'm going to pull up the
next.

57b46e0b-27d9-4776-b3ad-ca0b3837cc5f-0
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:09.490
OK.

a2375486-99c9-4abf-bb71-5852d0778137-0
01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:26.331
I hope these stories have an
ending. So like want to find out

a2375486-99c9-4abf-bb71-5852d0778137-1
01:10:26.331 --> 01:10:26.580
what.

62902730-0631-453e-a4ef-ed962c6b14f4-0
01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.480
Sure they don't.

1c9b1616-dc40-49f7-9e68-b75bfc27f164-0
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:44.709
OK. So the next one is a story.
It's 20 slides and like, so this

1c9b1616-dc40-49f7-9e68-b75bfc27f164-1
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:50.640
one, so like before 10 to 15
minutes to talk about the story

1c9b1616-dc40-49f7-9e68-b75bfc27f164-2
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.474
and then as you're ready, you
just have me move through the

1c9b1616-dc40-49f7-9e68-b75bfc27f164-3
01:10:56.474 --> 01:11:01.529
slides. I'm going to share my
screen and I'm going.

ed6c6cd5-1c4f-42db-9e33-bf932433e499-0
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:07.069
To play from the beginning, and
you could begin when you're

ed6c6cd5-1c4f-42db-9e33-bf932433e499-1
01:11:07.069 --> 01:11:11.610
ready. I'm just describing and
telling the story.

c13481c5-21d5-46fc-84a4-405727d259c0-0
01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.040
OK.

d59b5c9f-dc1a-4445-89c6-e98a70d68e4c-0
01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:22.912
#START_journey So we're standing
outside a building that looks to

d59b5c9f-dc1a-4445-89c6-e98a70d68e4c-1
01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:26.800
be a three story building.
There's a street lamp.

c6e81559-f6b5-402c-93d0-5cc6da513917-0
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.280
And there's a mailbox.

55bd9ed5-fc49-4455-aa13-9aa285f03e1a-0
01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.450
Can't quite see mailbox with.

76c48476-619e-4137-95ef-8e0dec7f8375-0
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:39.589
Oh yeah, and next to it is
someone on a bicycle and someone

76c48476-619e-4137-95ef-8e0dec7f8375-1
01:11:39.589 --> 01:11:43.960
on a skateboard and they're high
fiving each other. And then

76c48476-619e-4137-95ef-8e0dec7f8375-2
01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:48.403
there's another little boy who's
standing next to the mailbox

76c48476-619e-4137-95ef-8e0dec7f8375-3
01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:51.700
staring at the house and there's
a stoplight.

9450316f-1c2f-4ffb-a070-e022995173d6-0
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.530
This House must be on a corner.

8e1fe84f-497c-4c4b-bf02-90c1a869a5ce-0
01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:57.180
And a fire hydrant.

7caa3b6c-ef27-4ac8-a5b5-a2c6e025adc4-0
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.310
Then you can kind of see inside
the building, outside on the

7caa3b6c-ef27-4ac8-a5b5-a2c6e025adc4-1
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:07.340
front steps is a little girl.

0af29aca-71c0-4545-a6de-777e2430327a-0
01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.220
Sitting on the steps with her
red

2588b5e2-9c0a-4fa1-badf-1f57dc9cb9cf-0
01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:17.040
scooter, in front of her, leaned
up against the the railing.

6d3be376-a6d6-4cb5-8461-df19c9edebe0-0
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.110
And you can see.

9c9a7562-c58c-4fe2-90e3-bca7e7b7fa43-0
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:25.012
Inside the house in inside four
different rooms. So one room

9c9a7562-c58c-4fe2-90e3-bca7e7b7fa43-1
01:12:25.012 --> 01:12:29.845
looks to be a study where a man
is sitting at a desk with a

9c9a7562-c58c-4fe2-90e3-bca7e7b7fa43-2
01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:30.570
computer.

054dd0e2-2b6a-4188-9288-a37a64eab90f-0
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.326
And he's sitting in a rolling
desk chair and there are

054dd0e2-2b6a-4188-9288-a37a64eab90f-1
01:12:36.326 --> 01:12:37.170
bookshelves.

1daf0158-a01f-412f-9700-c7f419012698-0
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:40.280
Next to him, full of books.

1d32e12b-174c-4469-a84d-253c7b15cfbe-0
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:46.690
And on the wall are a couple
picture frames.

1c86f8a2-c850-4580-bceb-5e3628a3ccbe-0
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.750
In another room, you can see a
young girl lounging on a couch.

0d4248e8-d283-499d-8717-b4fe1e040061-0
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:59.160
Looking at something in her
hand.

48f5e951-6c17-4526-84fb-51dfe5f2286f-0
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.630
And there's a large picture on
the wall above her.

c6f07f1d-e67a-4f8c-8d29-f89e04178d36-0
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.812
And then you can see another
picture looks like a woman in a

c6f07f1d-e67a-4f8c-8d29-f89e04178d36-1
01:13:12.812 --> 01:13:15.530
kitchen, and the woman is
standing at the stove.

53cf9c9c-dd52-401d-802f-bc6bfd1baee1-0
01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:22.412
Stirring something that's on the
stove top, stirring something in

53cf9c9c-dd52-401d-802f-bc6bfd1baee1-1
01:13:22.412 --> 01:13:27.885
the saucepan and there's a large
vent above the stove. She's also

53cf9c9c-dd52-401d-802f-bc6bfd1baee1-2
01:13:27.885 --> 01:13:33.109
talking on the phone and has the
phone tucked on her left ear.

53cf9c9c-dd52-401d-802f-bc6bfd1baee1-3
01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:38.499
And the phone is is a wall phone
that has a cord attached to it.

53cf9c9c-dd52-401d-802f-bc6bfd1baee1-4
01:13:38.499 --> 01:13:40.489
So the old style phones.

7d8bc93f-c751-40f8-8105-9c4af1546fcb-0
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:45.085
And she's got a cupboard door
open with a lot of different

7d8bc93f-c751-40f8-8105-9c4af1546fcb-1
01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:48.580
things in the cupboard. Looks
like spices. She's probably

7d8bc93f-c751-40f8-8105-9c4af1546fcb-2
01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.870
adding to her pot that she's
cooking.

cbd22e50-9a3c-4e65-b092-008c8528a1cb-0
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.588
And then there's another room
that looks to be the entryway to

cbd22e50-9a3c-4e65-b092-008c8528a1cb-1
01:13:56.588 --> 01:14:01.031
the house. So there's a what's
called a coat tree. So it's a

cbd22e50-9a3c-4e65-b092-008c8528a1cb-2
01:14:01.031 --> 01:14:05.110
large stand that has coats
hanging on it and and a hat.

d6270435-ef88-49ed-b490-0cd083699d38-0
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:10.750
And there's a small entryway
table with a.

896c6a05-102a-49ef-8e0a-34e12f288df4-0
01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:17.522
Lamp on top of the table and a
large vase in the corner with

896c6a05-102a-49ef-8e0a-34e12f288df4-1
01:14:17.522 --> 01:14:17.970
some.

f44162c0-2193-4c90-848c-342bcec33309-0
01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.270
Flowers or foliage coming out of
the vase.

05b860e7-8617-4544-a9d6-3a474ff040f9-0
01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.330
And on the wall. The wall has
wallpaper on it.

43dd38ed-11c8-40a3-a78b-e25a5c4e47bf-0
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.840
And there's two pic two framed
pictures on the wall.

4523a05e-f380-4d34-8b9f-34c414280978-0
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.486
Then there's a door from the
entryway that looks like it goes

4523a05e-f380-4d34-8b9f-34c414280978-1
01:14:38.486 --> 01:14:43.568
to the steps that go upstairs,
and it has the steps have

4523a05e-f380-4d34-8b9f-34c414280978-2
01:14:43.568 --> 01:14:48.827
carpeting on and a curved
railing, and there's a mirror on

4523a05e-f380-4d34-8b9f-34c414280978-3
01:14:48.827 --> 01:14:49.630
the wall.

4a82b10e-cf16-4e6f-aade-a7254a09993e-0
01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.548
You can also kind of see
underneath that looks like it's

4a82b10e-cf16-4e6f-aade-a7254a09993e-1
01:14:55.548 --> 01:14:57.650
in the basement with big pipes
and.

574dcefa-89c4-4903-95ea-bedb47b54318-0
01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:00.530
And things running through it.

76a69212-391a-4a2c-b824-e48ab9654ac7-0
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:05.110
OK, sorry.

1bfc70fb-35ab-45be-a8c0-462a64c7e904-0
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.923
So now we see three individual
pictures. One is the woman in

1bfc70fb-35ab-45be-a8c0-462a64c7e904-1
01:15:11.923 --> 01:15:15.665
the kitchen stirring something
on the stove top in the kettle.

1bfc70fb-35ab-45be-a8c0-462a64c7e904-2
01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:17.150
She's still on the phone.

2cc5edc6-165d-49bc-a9f7-b10d7c45a9c3-0
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:20.600
She's wearing a skirt and a
blouse.

3f0180f5-1ec0-444c-822b-e366928af537-0
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:25.385
And there's the little girl that
had the red scooter. She's now

3f0180f5-1ec0-444c-822b-e366928af537-1
01:15:25.385 --> 01:15:29.360
inside the kitchen and has her
red scooter in the kitchen also.

e68b54f7-3fe0-43b0-a110-4e58c4ec0e80-0
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:35.785
Now the little girl has gone
into the study where the man is

e68b54f7-3fe0-43b0-a110-4e58c4ec0e80-1
01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:41.316
at the desk with the computer,
and now she has a red kite that

e68b54f7-3fe0-43b0-a110-4e58c4ec0e80-2
01:15:41.316 --> 01:15:45.969
she is pulling behind her,
dragging it on the floor.

049dcc90-2e08-457f-8ab9-8355f7017ed5-0
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:51.304
And now she's gone into the
room, I think, with the girl

049dcc90-2e08-457f-8ab9-8355f7017ed5-1
01:15:51.304 --> 01:15:56.493
who's lounging on the couch, and
it looks like the little girl

049dcc90-2e08-457f-8ab9-8355f7017ed5-2
01:15:56.493 --> 01:15:58.800
now has a red ball with her.

e8ba683e-74f9-4eae-a9fc-2678c94d7edc-0
01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.646
And then there's a large picture
where the little girl looks to

e8ba683e-74f9-4eae-a9fc-2678c94d7edc-1
01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:05.490
be very lonely and she's in her

152ac1a8-dbe6-42c1-9520-557ec62dec44-0
01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.230
bedroom.

4814193d-0f10-4037-af2e-1bc3dc0a2c6c-0
01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:13.732
And the the blanket on her bed
has sailboats on it, and she is

4814193d-0f10-4037-af2e-1bc3dc0a2c6c-1
01:16:13.732 --> 01:16:18.294
leaning up against the corner of
the bed with a pillow. On the

4814193d-0f10-4037-af2e-1bc3dc0a2c6c-2
01:16:18.294 --> 01:16:20.249
wall is a map of the world.

0b388657-1224-4e75-873b-b2f3114e2042-0
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.390
Her light that hangs down from
the ceiling is actually looks

0b388657-1224-4e75-873b-b2f3114e2042-1
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:26.910
like a hot air balloon.

3575b834-7fba-44d2-90fd-a5e1b85c8403-0
01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:28.280
Light.

02d3308a-5454-4326-8702-de12f1df8c42-0
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.980
On the floor is a cat who is
curled up sleeping.

15993b9f-50c0-4fae-8e36-7577a415bbd7-0
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:35.920
There's a dresser.

aaeda431-05a2-430d-acbd-27c32159c329-0
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.980
That has four drawers and on top
is a lamp.

3f1b8d4a-7b93-45cd-93a8-d95de87d6d27-0
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:44.810
And it's in front of a window
that looks outside.

acae229b-befe-4e31-8ec1-0952b05f4730-0
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:50.170
And you can see outside the
window are tall buildings.

fcdaed1d-f016-4c68-8d59-418fd827a58e-0
01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:52.570
OK.

ca8f31a8-1062-4005-81fd-c1baa90ac19d-0
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:57.350
Now the little girl is still in
her room.

3abc7baa-74aa-4ad1-b87d-639ba47b367e-0
01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:01.430
But the cat has woke up and is
walking outside the room.

f3379976-6162-42ee-867d-a1f77df69a4e-0
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:07.721
And on the floor, the little
girl is looking at something on

f3379976-6162-42ee-867d-a1f77df69a4e-1
01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:11.390
the floor it looks to be like
papers and a red.

6c144c18-5ee8-4ab3-b546-aa9ed80b1a0b-0
01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.990
Mark red marker.

be3cda7c-b4bd-4ab7-ab40-fbfd94f79e34-0
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.490
And now you can see the little
girl.

62c95e8f-09bd-447e-a329-1f50d50a7ca4-0
01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:27.075
Is grabbing the red marker and
she is drawing on the wall and

62c95e8f-09bd-447e-a329-1f50d50a7ca4-1
01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:31.250
she has drawn a door, a red door
that.

103c651c-2f52-462a-8fd5-8fadea78abc9-0
01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.670
Opens up and the little girl is
escaping through the door.

24a617ba-32d7-4921-b70c-eb37a3293f50-0
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.440
Now the little girl is on the
other side of the red door.

4d4ce916-efe4-4274-997c-0830fcb61082-0
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.680
And she has entered into a.

6ad3fed0-085a-4ee4-b389-3e43b55f5916-0
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:48.740
Beautiful, calm looking forest.

1ccb66d8-6870-441e-9129-e5f764df3dd7-0
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:56.189
And in the forest there is a
stream that is winding through

1ccb66d8-6870-441e-9129-e5f764df3dd7-1
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:57.430
the forest.

ac70f060-9cac-4888-a412-6a93d345488d-0
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.250
And hung up from tree to tree
are strings of lights.

4a45dd01-2c0e-4be3-9e6e-723dad246b54-0
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.330
And hanging from some of the
lights are blue lanterns.

0d8c9f43-d2cb-43b4-bca5-47199ed38be3-0
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.940
Umm.

eaf24b8a-9572-4d5d-b3de-bc773600c114-0
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.465
Some of the lanterns are real
small and some of them are

eaf24b8a-9572-4d5d-b3de-bc773600c114-1
01:18:17.465 --> 01:18:22.130
larger and some of them look to
be kind of an Asian style.

cf2b8d1a-4230-4e9e-8df2-a21c22e394db-0
01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.650
Lantern.

5a87c48a-1f1b-4433-924c-e0c82858ace2-0
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.300
And the girl is looking up at
all the lanterns.

e4e928e3-77f6-4dc8-928d-0bc0122d25ce-0
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.827
Now the little girl is by the
stream, and there is a little

e4e928e3-77f6-4dc8-928d-0bc0122d25ce-1
01:18:35.827 --> 01:18:39.841
short dock that is built from
the from the land out into the

e4e928e3-77f6-4dc8-928d-0bc0122d25ce-2
01:18:39.841 --> 01:18:43.788
stream, and she's standing at
the edge of the stream, still

e4e928e3-77f6-4dc8-928d-0bc0122d25ce-3
01:18:43.788 --> 01:18:47.736
holding her red marker, and
she's looking at the reflection

e4e928e3-77f6-4dc8-928d-0bc0122d25ce-4
01:18:47.736 --> 01:18:50.500
in the stream the little girl
has leaned.

c737ec48-09f9-4e92-8a57-0733137f69c1-0
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:56.045
kneeled down on the edge of the
dock with her red marker and

c737ec48-09f9-4e92-8a57-0733137f69c1-1
01:18:56.045 --> 01:19:00.442
she's drawing in the water.
She's now laying down with her

c737ec48-09f9-4e92-8a57-0733137f69c1-2
01:19:00.442 --> 01:19:05.137
feet up in the air, laying on
her stomach, continuing to draw,

c737ec48-09f9-4e92-8a57-0733137f69c1-3
01:19:05.137 --> 01:19:09.460
and she's actually drawing a
little boat and she's drawn.

5217c23d-29fc-435c-b261-90e3b474137f-0
01:19:10.170 --> 01:19:11.570
It's a bright red boat.

aba17f1c-6127-4cbf-875f-6c26a95e41ac-0
01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:14.740
And she has gotten into the
boat.

fd8f225d-d758-41fa-bed4-4f009ccd6f22-0
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:23.734
So now you can see the little
girl is still in the boat in the

fd8f225d-d758-41fa-bed4-4f009ccd6f22-1
01:19:23.734 --> 01:19:27.230
stream, headed towards a very
large castle.

24e139f4-3991-41bd-851c-75d6404eb2b6-0
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:33.710
I guess the castle has a large.

20e6c16c-d0c2-489e-b2e0-8a0ec1a24344-0
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.820
Moat around it.

088b7a8b-2d09-4858-9934-4b8545a9d263-0
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:42.429
And it looks like the Moat with
the water winds out into a

088b7a8b-2d09-4858-9934-4b8545a9d263-1
01:19:42.429 --> 01:19:44.380
larger body of water.

853aa016-61a7-41b7-b7bf-c7beb2e8833c-0
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:47.000
The.

c9d70b46-70ef-4ba0-9298-91ce294d9636-0
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:54.146
Castle is very large with a lot
of different turrets and domes.

c9d70b46-70ef-4ba0-9298-91ce294d9636-1
01:19:54.146 --> 01:19:59.281
Some of the domes look like they
are covered in gold, so they're

c9d70b46-70ef-4ba0-9298-91ce294d9636-2
01:19:59.281 --> 01:20:01.020
very bright and shiny.

11554bd4-9cb4-45b2-9665-e70c01470a16-0
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:05.700
There is.

07618727-c1e3-4677-83ba-207c319b3749-0
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.990
So the so the girl in the red
boat is headed towards a small.

51d7594e-09a1-4fbb-ab20-9367453163d4-0
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:17.878
Bridge over the Moat into
towards the castle, but there's

51d7594e-09a1-4fbb-ab20-9367453163d4-1
01:20:17.878 --> 01:20:21.610
also on the other side a much
taller bridge.

fe88d130-0457-4955-92c6-68f062f7e2b5-0
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.510
Um with.

254064b7-92eb-4408-8972-63df91835c7a-0
01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:30.540
A boat underneath in the water
in the Moat and on top of that

254064b7-92eb-4408-8972-63df91835c7a-1
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:35.350
bridge it looks like it's a
water bridge with another boat.

985c6f27-1cc6-45a0-b058-96636dd0a131-0
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.440
Crossing the bridge.

102f9f0c-b405-468f-a29e-1dcb1b134766-0
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:42.520
OK.

1167c2c8-3fd8-411f-ad81-cd6b7c8e3d3f-0
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:50.107
So now you can still see the
little girl in the red boat and

1167c2c8-3fd8-411f-ad81-cd6b7c8e3d3f-1
01:20:50.107 --> 01:20:55.728
she has made it into what looks
like a series of locks, raising

1167c2c8-3fd8-411f-ad81-cd6b7c8e3d3f-2
01:20:55.728 --> 01:20:58.100
her up higher on the water.

916f5835-2fe2-495e-bad0-9d6575a4af64-0
01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:04.242
Bridge, water bridges. And there
is an attendant at the at the

916f5835-2fe2-495e-bad0-9d6575a4af64-1
01:21:04.242 --> 01:21:08.686
bridge, at the locks, who is
waving to her, greeting the

916f5835-2fe2-495e-bad0-9d6575a4af64-2
01:21:08.686 --> 01:21:13.754
little boy, I mean greeting the
little girl. And there are other

916f5835-2fe2-495e-bad0-9d6575a4af64-3
01:21:13.754 --> 01:21:14.300
people.

595b7dee-f5f0-4141-9a6b-972654086eec-0
01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:20.501
Under one of the large domes who
are standing on the side waving

595b7dee-f5f0-4141-9a6b-972654086eec-1
01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:25.213
to the little girl, and they're
in uniforms that are kind of

595b7dee-f5f0-4141-9a6b-972654086eec-2
01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:30.080
greenish, yellowish uniforms.
There are also some other locks.

07707f61-dd2b-4fdb-bbc2-2fb17802bf01-0
01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:36.896
And water bridges where other
people are entering in other

07707f61-dd2b-4fdb-bbc2-2fb17802bf01-1
01:21:36.896 --> 01:21:39.780
boats and standing on the boats.

2cc2f806-07f0-4745-9072-8111a998b8bd-0
01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.550
Umm.

c825406f-18fa-4fad-bb8e-5d0597e112a7-0
01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.140
Yeah, OK.

e796fab5-29e5-463a-a7d7-22a532d6681d-0
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:55.176
So now the little girl in the
red boat has come to the edge of

e796fab5-29e5-463a-a7d7-22a532d6681d-1
01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:56.830
one of the water.

c7da0759-14e2-4c1c-a51a-6ab0e42ee85f-0
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.224
Waterways over the bridge and
she's coming to the edge where

c7da0759-14e2-4c1c-a51a-6ab0e42ee85f-1
01:22:02.224 --> 01:22:07.152
the water is falling down like a
big waterfall and there are men

c7da0759-14e2-4c1c-a51a-6ab0e42ee85f-2
01:22:07.152 --> 01:22:11.398
in uniforms up in the tower
above her who are waving, I

c7da0759-14e2-4c1c-a51a-6ab0e42ee85f-3
01:22:11.398 --> 01:22:13.370
think, trying to warn her.

827d6afa-5c20-44a1-966c-696a945fd813-0
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:16.020
Not to go over the waterfall.

ba7f070a-64b0-4b9d-b9c1-7b2b88b48b49-0
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:22.614
There are still some other water
bridges that you can see where

ba7f070a-64b0-4b9d-b9c1-7b2b88b48b49-1
01:22:22.614 --> 01:22:28.032
people are in other other boats.
So now the girl still has the

ba7f070a-64b0-4b9d-b9c1-7b2b88b48b49-2
01:22:28.032 --> 01:22:33.106
white marker with her and as
she's falling she's drawing a

ba7f070a-64b0-4b9d-b9c1-7b2b88b48b49-3
01:22:33.106 --> 01:22:33.450
big.

3f67f0e3-3da0-4df0-b224-57ebd0e665bc-0
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.470
Half circle with her red magic
marker.

2f02475b-8b82-496e-b611-4d282db4c014-0
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:46.165
So she hasn't just drawn half
circle, she's drawn an entire

2f02475b-8b82-496e-b611-4d282db4c014-1
01:22:46.165 --> 01:22:51.302
bright red hot air balloon, and
she is in the red basket at the

2f02475b-8b82-496e-b611-4d282db4c014-2
01:22:51.302 --> 01:22:55.797
bottom of the hot air balloon,
waving to the men in the

2f02475b-8b82-496e-b611-4d282db4c014-3
01:22:55.797 --> 01:22:56.440
uniform.

53821c94-d574-4265-9dfe-c40651bcde88-0
01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.120
That she is safe and the men in
the uniform are in a big tower.

47773eda-9aaa-4df7-85dc-4ead1ed0ffaa-0
01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:08.005
That at the very top has a
weather vane, and the weather

47773eda-9aaa-4df7-85dc-4ead1ed0ffaa-1
01:23:08.005 --> 01:23:10.540
vane has a sailboat on it.

622c0e31-bc13-4e40-80ab-7fcf0753e7b4-0
01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.650
So now we're also looking inside
the clouds.

49fa79fa-90a4-4ae5-a598-62b392329078-0
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:22.040
Where the girl is going with the
hot air balloon and there is a.

33bf75b7-e2c5-45df-9620-b50443dc3139-0
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:30.930
Steam contraption that looks
like it's a half boat.

816bd27e-e3ec-489b-a5d0-5e4b534feb15-0
01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.270
Half flying object with
smokestacks with smoke coming

816bd27e-e3ec-489b-a5d0-5e4b534feb15-1
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:41.795
out of them and what looks like
a large kind of paddle wheel and

816bd27e-e3ec-489b-a5d0-5e4b534feb15-2
01:23:41.795 --> 01:23:43.750
a propeller on the end.

78bf7ac4-913b-4a2f-b88c-e44ce9e1ff20-0
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:47.370
And you can see some other
smaller.

3b6a6dea-cfc3-40f1-88c7-6b5c5a7c97d9-0
01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:53.760
Well, it look like blimps with
people in them.

9bdbdc1d-c712-49d6-8d92-c8bffde7096c-0
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:02.490
Now you can still see the girl
in the red basket of the red hot

9bdbdc1d-c712-49d6-8d92-c8bffde7096c-1
01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:06.799
air balloon. She still has her
red magic marker with her and

9bdbdc1d-c712-49d6-8d92-c8bffde7096c-2
01:24:06.799 --> 01:24:09.060
she's looking out at the clouds.

aba36fc3-eaff-4f55-9059-51ca27893949-0
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.680
And you can still see the large.

b43ae8aa-f815-4049-a8be-01cff45dfecf-0
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:21.083
Contraption that has the
smokestacks and the paddle wheel

b43ae8aa-f815-4049-a8be-01cff45dfecf-1
01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:26.020
and the propeller still in the
clouds, along with a smaller.

116349cb-9887-4aed-b634-66c3857ba1c9-0
01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:34.610
Kind of blimp like object and it
looks like someone.

ffa7c39f-0df8-49d2-9fbe-98725cdb904b-0
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.943
With a has a net and is trying
to catch a purple bird that is

ffa7c39f-0df8-49d2-9fbe-98725cdb904b-1
01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:44.250
flying through the clouds and
the person with the net is.

cf58dd8c-3f36-4b85-b6c5-c8556045cb12-0
01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:50.843
Being held onto the blimp by two
people holding on to their the

cf58dd8c-3f36-4b85-b6c5-c8556045cb12-1
01:24:50.843 --> 01:24:55.620
person's legs and they're hoping
to catch the bird and put it in

cf58dd8c-3f36-4b85-b6c5-c8556045cb12-2
01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.780
the bird cage that they have on
the blimp.

47552f78-6591-49d0-a321-200814683843-0
01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.790
So now we still see the girl in
the red hot air balloon.

4c10e2df-56d8-407b-ae01-b7bf9d8e6542-0
01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.830
And she is much closer to the.

f4084dd0-ce70-47a6-b00c-370139fa33da-0
01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.230
Um, flying half boat half.

24206099-0d80-42ad-9d85-c332416afd8a-0
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:23.160
I don't know what it is.

630c9f89-e9fa-4227-9c60-484031ece0f4-0
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:29.403
The contraption with the
smokestacks and it is very

630c9f89-e9fa-4227-9c60-484031ece0f4-1
01:25:29.403 --> 01:25:33.820
large, much much larger than her
hot air balloon.

92ad3d30-7ecc-4af2-81ab-9368d2f1a67f-0
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.560
And on top of it, by the two
smokestacks you can see what

92ad3d30-7ecc-4af2-81ab-9368d2f1a67f-1
01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.360
looks like a gold.

46a7055c-b61a-4c5a-b3b9-567b3d2cea12-0
01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:51.892
Statue kind of built, and it's a
gold bird with its wings spread

46a7055c-b61a-4c5a-b3b9-567b3d2cea12-1
01:25:51.892 --> 01:25:55.380
out wide and on the other side.

cfc6033f-6e3e-460b-a37c-bc740d4317e3-0
01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:01.106
Is a platform where it looks
like the people have caught the

cfc6033f-6e3e-460b-a37c-bc740d4317e3-1
01:26:01.106 --> 01:26:06.195
purple bird and put it in the
bird cage and they are lowering

cfc6033f-6e3e-460b-a37c-bc740d4317e3-2
01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:09.150
the bird cage down to the
platform.

73dbe0b0-4808-4586-b01d-daaa15806c3a-0
01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:12.200
OK.

ec17ecd5-ae1e-4fe7-835d-dfd2a2e605df-0
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:19.231
And now you see the girl in the
hot air balloon has landed the

ec17ecd5-ae1e-4fe7-835d-dfd2a2e605df-1
01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:23.484
hot air balloon on that platform
on that large flying

ec17ecd5-ae1e-4fe7-835d-dfd2a2e605df-2
01:26:23.484 --> 01:26:28.446
contraption, and she is running
across a bridge still with her

ec17ecd5-ae1e-4fe7-835d-dfd2a2e605df-3
01:26:28.446 --> 01:26:33.566
red magic marker towards one of
the smokestacks that has an open

ec17ecd5-ae1e-4fe7-835d-dfd2a2e605df-4
01:26:33.566 --> 01:26:33.960
door.

28495749-aba4-4b17-b385-6e356857a298-0
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:39.846
Up above the between the two
smokestacks, there's a bridge

28495749-aba4-4b17-b385-6e356857a298-1
01:26:39.846 --> 01:26:42.680
and you can see two people are
marching.

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-0
01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:48.747
And they have a pole between
them that is carrying the bird

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-1
01:26:48.747 --> 01:26:53.739
cage, the bird cage that has the
purple bird in it. And they are

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-2
01:26:53.739 --> 01:26:58.577
going into an open door on the
other smokestack so you can see

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-3
01:26:58.577 --> 01:27:02.647
the the gold statue with the
bird that has its wings

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-4
01:27:02.647 --> 01:27:07.255
outspread. It looks more, the
bird looks more like a dragon

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-5
01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:12.247
with its wings stretched out, a
dragon with a long snout, and it

d1c4fb37-9a04-4af9-85f9-e056a6f8cc39-6
01:27:12.247 --> 01:27:13.860
looks to be all gold.

1fa99f0d-0365-451d-88cf-83c552fd064d-0
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:19.737
on a and there's a platform
under the gold roof and it has

1fa99f0d-0365-451d-88cf-83c552fd064d-1
01:27:19.737 --> 01:27:25.610
two guards who are guarding the
purple bird in the bird cage.

b0f95847-6381-45b8-a800-7bf65838c42b-0
01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:31.205
And down on either side of this
platform are two ladders, and on

b0f95847-6381-45b8-a800-7bf65838c42b-1
01:27:31.205 --> 01:27:35.120
one ladder the little girl has
climbed up, and she is.

78947934-a49f-405d-ab90-972849af0b16-0
01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:40.650
Right at the top of that
platform with her red marker.

1f80abc4-0f25-469b-adb1-325c583a0dd7-0
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:48.485
Now the two guards are startled
because the little girl has

1f80abc4-0f25-469b-adb1-325c583a0dd7-1
01:27:48.485 --> 01:27:53.247
grabbed that bird cage with the
purple bird and she is running

1f80abc4-0f25-469b-adb1-325c583a0dd7-2
01:27:53.247 --> 01:27:54.230
away with it.

82c21b34-1e02-475b-a1eb-472667845708-0
01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.020
You can see.

1a4fb9b5-088e-4bc4-a8b8-6bbdc95dcf05-0
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.362
The back end of the large
contraption with the the flying

1a4fb9b5-088e-4bc4-a8b8-6bbdc95dcf05-1
01:28:05.362 --> 01:28:07.880
contraption with the two
smokestacks.

68bc3094-810a-4f26-a69a-14ae6db5bfe5-0
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.036
You can see that she has made it
across a small bridge out onto

68bc3094-810a-4f26-a69a-14ae6db5bfe5-1
01:28:15.036 --> 01:28:20.457
a, a round platform and she is
releasing the purple bird into

68bc3094-810a-4f26-a69a-14ae6db5bfe5-2
01:28:20.457 --> 01:28:25.965
the air and the cage is next to
her with the open door and her

68bc3094-810a-4f26-a69a-14ae6db5bfe5-3
01:28:25.965 --> 01:28:27.190
red marker is.

a5d8f1c4-1c20-41fc-93cb-3409962d86f1-0
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:33.551
Is sitting next to the bird cage
and two of the security guards

a5d8f1c4-1c20-41fc-93cb-3409962d86f1-1
01:28:33.551 --> 01:28:36.610
with spears are running after
her.

e8e33285-faef-44b3-b615-72b2f51756b0-0
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.488
So now out on that platform, the
you can still see the bird cage

e8e33285-faef-44b3-b615-72b2f51756b0-1
01:28:45.488 --> 01:28:48.340
with the open door. And there's
one.

4f640431-c17d-468e-9f62-c06bb676e940-0
01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:54.842
Guard who is standing on the
edge and he has grabbed her red

4f640431-c17d-468e-9f62-c06bb676e940-1
01:28:54.842 --> 01:28:59.585
marker and has dropped it off
the side of that platform. There

4f640431-c17d-468e-9f62-c06bb676e940-2
01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:03.726
are two security guards, 2
guards who have grabbed the

4f640431-c17d-468e-9f62-c06bb676e940-3
01:29:03.726 --> 01:29:08.695
little girl's arm and pulling on
one arm while she's reaching out

4f640431-c17d-468e-9f62-c06bb676e940-4
01:29:08.695 --> 01:29:12.460
with the other arm trying to get
that red marker.

32bdbd1f-6edd-4534-80b3-de480ab0f6fc-0
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:20.497
At the back end now you can see
her in a kind of open cage like

32bdbd1f-6edd-4534-80b3-de480ab0f6fc-1
01:29:20.497 --> 01:29:26.110
that is being lowered by a
pulley down from the back end by

32bdbd1f-6edd-4534-80b3-de480ab0f6fc-2
01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:27.420
the propeller.

29594b6e-c643-4709-9345-99a57055d766-0
01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:33.367
Of this large contraption and
two people are lowering her

29594b6e-c643-4709-9345-99a57055d766-1
01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:33.820
down.

5218d1af-440d-4472-9c97-1f8d07268557-0
01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.771
So now the little girl is still
in this open cage like device

5218d1af-440d-4472-9c97-1f8d07268557-1
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:48.045
that is being lowered down, but
here comes the purple bird

5218d1af-440d-4472-9c97-1f8d07268557-2
01:29:48.045 --> 01:29:52.175
flying towards her and the
purple bird has found her red

5218d1af-440d-4472-9c97-1f8d07268557-3
01:29:52.175 --> 01:29:56.956
marker and is bringing it to her
and she's jumping for joy. So so

5218d1af-440d-4472-9c97-1f8d07268557-4
01:29:56.956 --> 01:30:01.593
now she's kneeling down on the
ground and the purple bird is on

5218d1af-440d-4472-9c97-1f8d07268557-5
01:30:01.593 --> 01:30:05.649
her shoulder and she's drawing
something on the ground.

94b974f3-e7a9-4963-8578-d9d77285c196-0
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.000
She continues to draw.

94804fd3-0e70-4d19-8fb8-b1a1f4cbbe78-0
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:14.200
I don't know what she drew. Ohh
she drew. OK, so.

1a83fcd8-d81b-472e-b85c-586aaad3e325-0
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:20.444
Now with her magic marker, she
drew a magic carpet, a red magic

1a83fcd8-d81b-472e-b85c-586aaad3e325-1
01:30:20.444 --> 01:30:25.435
carpet and she is on that and
has escaped from her kind of

1a83fcd8-d81b-472e-b85c-586aaad3e325-2
01:30:25.435 --> 01:30:30.257
cage and is flying above the
ground following the Purple

1a83fcd8-d81b-472e-b85c-586aaad3e325-3
01:30:30.257 --> 01:30:30.680
bird.

350dd6d7-e5e7-4975-bee5-0c9b3fb5d1d5-0
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:38.360
She's flying through the sky
that's full of stars.

d56358cc-2ab5-40da-8123-51c941ef12bc-0
01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:43.542
And down below is one of the
castles and then in the

d56358cc-2ab5-40da-8123-51c941ef12bc-1
01:30:43.542 --> 01:30:46.870
background you can see a
mountain range.

03181f9a-561d-4bc0-8964-c190977482a5-0
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.348
And the purple bird is also
flying. Looks to be guiding her,

03181f9a-561d-4bc0-8964-c190977482a5-1
01:30:52.348 --> 01:30:55.990
and they're headed towards a
large palm tree.

b1634a7b-4388-4509-9636-5c30f253f851-0
01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:02.808
So they've made it down to the
palm tree on the ground, and in

b1634a7b-4388-4509-9636-5c30f253f851-1
01:31:02.808 --> 01:31:04.750
the bottom of the palm tree is
a.

c7719b85-db94-4fab-8ba4-17284ef47460-0
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.390
Door.

034246aa-4566-41a4-a6d8-469382349b1d-0
01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:11.026
And the little girl has the
marker in her hand as he's

034246aa-4566-41a4-a6d8-469382349b1d-1
01:31:11.026 --> 01:31:14.829
walking towards the door. And
the purple bird is is next to

034246aa-4566-41a4-a6d8-469382349b1d-2
01:31:14.829 --> 01:31:18.886
the door. So she's reaching for
the door and is opening it. And

034246aa-4566-41a4-a6d8-469382349b1d-3
01:31:18.886 --> 01:31:22.562
as she opens that door, the
purple bird flies through the

034246aa-4566-41a4-a6d8-469382349b1d-4
01:31:22.562 --> 01:31:26.619
the opening and the little girl
is climbing is crawling through

034246aa-4566-41a4-a6d8-469382349b1d-5
01:31:26.619 --> 01:31:27.380
the opening.

fa06df90-ef3e-40a9-94f9-e5e572407a06-0
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.379
So now the little girl is
actually coming out of the

fa06df90-ef3e-40a9-94f9-e5e572407a06-1
01:31:35.379 --> 01:31:39.587
mailbox. The mailbox that was in
the very first picture we talked

fa06df90-ef3e-40a9-94f9-e5e572407a06-2
01:31:39.587 --> 01:31:39.970
about.

76896839-2483-4c5e-b4c2-850ef21da00c-0
01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.195
Where the little boy was
standing outside the house with

76896839-2483-4c5e-b4c2-850ef21da00c-1
01:31:45.195 --> 01:31:50.141
the stoplight and the and the
street lights. So she's climbing

76896839-2483-4c5e-b4c2-850ef21da00c-2
01:31:50.141 --> 01:31:54.460
out of that mailbox and the
purple bird is there also.

7cd78428-ce9a-416b-b0cd-574ecc4a837f-0
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:58.071
The little girl has the red
marker in her hand and the

7cd78428-ce9a-416b-b0cd-574ecc4a837f-1
01:31:58.071 --> 01:32:00.010
little boy that was standing
there.

c0fe0f87-59d9-4971-bae7-1e68ab3fbeca-0
01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.527
Standing there looking at the
house has a purple marker in her

c0fe0f87-59d9-4971-bae7-1e68ab3fbeca-1
01:32:04.527 --> 01:32:08.374
hand. His hand, and he's running
towards the bird and the little

c0fe0f87-59d9-4971-bae7-1e68ab3fbeca-2
01:32:08.374 --> 01:32:08.670
girl.

6b4fe799-cfef-43b6-b4de-42e9363febe5-0
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:10.350
The little.

26b33213-ff73-464a-9806-539b48f40b9d-0
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:12.070
Girl.

bcb7b03c-4922-47c8-9775-a928b49a98f3-0
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:18.431
Is crouching down on the ground
and the little boys reached out

bcb7b03c-4922-47c8-9775-a928b49a98f3-1
01:32:18.431 --> 01:32:23.286
his hand to her, and the boy is
now holding the purple bird on

bcb7b03c-4922-47c8-9775-a928b49a98f3-2
01:32:23.286 --> 01:32:23.980
his hand.

16bb936a-5832-4760-a1d1-478babf7cc80-0
01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:29.280
The girl has is drawing a red
circle with her marker.

b993feca-07f2-4d0d-aabb-4f5b13c41be5-0
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:34.670
And the little boy is drawing a
purple circle with his marker.

1196260a-e4b7-4fc0-a2d1-b830a7e1b5f7-0
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:37.240
Oops.

2aff7b9b-9e7f-45c5-a846-efe0f4e4d8f7-0
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:41.881
So now the red circle and the
Purple circle have become a

2aff7b9b-9e7f-45c5-a846-efe0f4e4d8f7-1
01:32:41.881 --> 01:32:45.328
bicycle built for two. So the
little girl is sitting on the

2aff7b9b-9e7f-45c5-a846-efe0f4e4d8f7-2
01:32:45.328 --> 01:32:48.946
front seat and the little boy is
sitting on the back seat, and

2aff7b9b-9e7f-45c5-a846-efe0f4e4d8f7-3
01:32:48.946 --> 01:32:52.450
they're riding away with the
purple bird flying behind them.

2aff7b9b-9e7f-45c5-a846-efe0f4e4d8f7-4
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:53.139
#END_journey

4a817ee3-c6c4-4a80-83ec-9a005ccf6761-0
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:55.790
Wow.

93409f9d-925d-4a2e-842f-16168ad8b592-0
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:58.140
Quite a story.

59332aa9-0ab0-421f-ae00-2e77ddb385f8-0
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:06.573
Yes. OK. So right now it's 2:00
o'clock. So this has been our

59332aa9-0ab0-421f-ae00-2e77ddb385f8-1
01:33:06.573 --> 01:33:07.220
hours.
