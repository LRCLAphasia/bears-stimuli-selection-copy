00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.120
And um, now we see just that
vase, um, sitting.

d9f9f83c-9dd2-4bd2-a6a0-7bc62dc5dd62-0
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.050
Um.

5f021fa8-7810-46f3-b825-2b7ebd5af75c-0
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.730
On what looks like a windowsill
or maybe inside a picture frame.

19921711-0126-49a4-b252-04a90496b28f-0
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.300
And um, someone is waking up.

29f5cbce-1ad0-4aee-85db-d4b78c7d90ca-0
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.020
So it's looks like it's the man
who was the guest.

c57ceb2d-3ce6-4b21-a525-1ae42fd757b5-0
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.992
And um, the little white
creature, pet creature, is

c57ceb2d-3ce6-4b21-a525-1ae42fd757b5-1
00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:27.820
coming up to greet him and wake
him up and he's petting him.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.724
And then we see he's putting on
his shirt and he's chopping up

63a79526-9e1b-4d2f-9be3-e684f9417704-1
00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:34.270
some food with a knife.

822f78d8-508e-463f-b477-c56551004a66-0
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.347
And I'm giving it to his pet
while he has the rest of the

822f78d8-508e-463f-b477-c56551004a66-1
00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:41.550
food on a plate on on a table.

d4505efb-101c-4aa1-ae34-3514c00e8b33-0
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.282
And then he's putting on his
jacket and his pet brings him

d4505efb-101c-4aa1-ae34-3514c00e8b33-1
00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:46.840
his hat.

81838548-b1df-4b4c-808d-390f3da3dd80-0
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.450
So that he can finish getting
ready.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.270
And now he's out walking in the
street with a ton of people.

298515af-42ea-4a78-b786-749873dbbe38-0
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.676

With maybe some basketry or some
some tapestries. There's someone

0fb62c27-05a5-42cc-acfa-4428c44d6cf2-1
00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:56.510

mural on the side of a building.

0fb62c27-05a5-42cc-acfa-4428c44d6cf2-2
00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.258
There's a woman, a street
vendor. She has a little cart

0fb62c27-05a5-42cc-acfa-4428c44d6cf2-3
00:08:00.258 --> 00:08:04.475

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.303
And the man with his little pet
and his suit in his hat, we see

9ddae774-9b5d-4198-a086-e08027bfccdb-1
00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:14.795
him, he goes up to a door and
he's talking to a gentleman with

9ddae774-9b5d-4198-a086-e08027bfccdb-2

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.766
Um, he's asking him something,
and the the gentleman is waving

370dba09-63cf-4391-9089-86eb6ae687ea-1
00:08:22.766 --> 00:08:24.630
up his hand like, you know, no.

339437a3-7a26-4cc4-aa69-ae788cb1a7b8-0
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.460
And then and then the gentleman
let me see our man. Um, he's

339437a3-7a26-4cc4-aa69-ae788cb1a7b8-1
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.180
asking. He's talking to somebody
else. I'm a guy who

f06ee481-61a7-4b59-b323-7fab34ac5948-0
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.920

work clothes and a frog looking

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.580
pet with a wrench in its mouth.
Looks like he works on a big

f06ee481-61a7-4b59-b323-7fab34ac5948-2
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.240
boiler and it looks like he's
asking him something. And this

f06ee481-61a7-4b59-b323-7fab34ac5948-3
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.000
means also putting up his hand
and saying no.

722a1e91-df5c-4bae-9117-5372b802fb20-0
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.852
And then we see the man in the
shop talking to the shopkeeper.

722a1e91-df5c-4bae-9117-5372b802fb20-1
00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:54.621
Same thing. He's asking her
something. She's saying, holding

722a1e91-df5c-4bae-9117-5372b802fb20-2
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.289

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.752
And then we see him outside next
to a big blimp with a huge fan

22ba5d0b-a77e-40ab-bd46-f930cc62946c-1
00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:03.150

And um, workers with brooms. And
he's talking to someone with a

7f888f63-e703-4cc7-bd69-8285be16fb3d-1
00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:09.770

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.381
#END_arrival-5 And he's also
holding his hand up and saying

53b51ed1-ee67-42f0-8603-dfc321b9e2f7-1
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:15.670

looking for work.

{OK. And like last week with
complex scenes, we asked that

6b33fe29-4eef-4164-9cd0-f3adfc2ac808-1
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.360
you take 3 to 5 minutes to
describe what you see happening

6b33fe29-4eef-4164-9cd0-f3adfc2ac808-2
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.030

Waldo and he has a letter there.
And, um, he's talking about he's

b13aff67-1692-4a66-a90f-c63566acb1b2-1
00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:17.210
setting off on a worldwide hike.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.550
And he's got all his supplies
and he's seen there's a lot of

6aefca1c-bd94-4c60-b497-a922c6ac61b8-1
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.460
other characters to spot.

f2a34600-aef3-4e7f-bce6-db79b9b634af-0
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.270
So this is a scene of it's a,
it's a city.

7a00aa65-62cf-4a83-9f9f-4f3e25b78787-0
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.430
And there are streets and
buildings and cars and people.

f0035a9b-cc4d-4289-87cd-e1db5cadea9f-0
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.390

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.689
So there's a large pink building
right in the center, with a

ae3e5774-290c-4448-82e8-e8015aa196e4-1
00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:48.464
white and red awning and pink
walls and windows and a red

00:10:48.464 --> 00:10:52.434
roof, and people out in the
roof. Looks like maybe there's a

ae3e5774-290c-4448-82e8-e8015aa196e4-3
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:56.469
guy trying to get a cat who's
escaped and maybe a firefighter

ae3e5774-290c-4448-82e8-e8015aa196e4-4
00:10:56.469 --> 00:10:56.990
helping.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.080
Um, across the street from there
is a blue brick building with.

9495b6d6-a5f4-4e60-aed2-b2892b45bf13-0
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.877
Looks like an office building.
You can see people working on

9495b6d6-a5f4-4e60-aed2-b2892b45bf13-1
00:11:06.877 --> 00:11:07.570
the computer.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.355
And there's men on ladders and
blue overalls. and they're

00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:17.641
cleaning the building, and some
of them up on top on the roof. A

00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:21.862
couple of have buckets on their
heads and they're fighting with

00:11:21.862 --> 00:11:24.830
mops. And one older person is
feeding birds.

down on the street, you know,

e8696543-0b31-48a8-870b-d54ec2cd4bec-1

One looks like a wizard. There's
a person with an awning selling

65864423-9fbd-4fff-b1bb-218d12614120-1
00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:43.090
pots, and there's a vine that's
like trailing all off the table

65864423-9fbd-4fff-b1bb-218d12614120-2
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.430
and onto the ground.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.597
There are people carrying dishes
and walking dogs and reading

26262540-9b0d-4afc-b52d-7449061fd9f7-1

4c7a07b4-ec4f-4b82-b5aa-1888bf1e7f54-0
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.664
There are people. Ohh. There's
Waldo walking with his walking

4c7a07b4-ec4f-4b82-b5aa-1888bf1e7f54-1
00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:59.020
stick and his backpack and all
the supplies.

824f5265-d27d-4a12-9171-3ad56338950e-0
00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:00.340
Um.

1e1ea4f8-4933-4ab5-81df-6df7cc41a00b-0
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.670
Passed him as a person with
yellow helmets.

a19680b4-906a-4897-82bb-7aca9b568c25-0
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.500

blue scooter.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.730
Is green and blue and cars and
yellow trucks.

2acc96a8-441b-44b9-b3ab-7be5c4fa6e39-0
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.450
Um, this person riding a
bicycle.

a65cc4c0-a157-4c54-b629-2b4b08f86f45-0
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.217
From the right, it looks like,
uh, like a bank or an official

a65cc4c0-a157-4c54-b629-2b4b08f86f45-1
00:12:21.217 --> 00:12:24.324
government building. And there's
someone raising their hat to

a65cc4c0-a157-4c54-b629-2b4b08f86f45-2
00:12:24.324 --> 00:12:26.479
someone important, maybe, maybe
the mayor.

273c6e97-2a24-46c8-9f00-6e291ae4ee4f-0
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.222
Um, there's like more window
washers, like hanging off with

273c6e97-2a24-46c8-9f00-6e291ae4ee4f-1
00:12:31.222 --> 00:12:32.610
ropes off a roof and.

ea391ee7-7ef4-49ed-8114-60e6e0cdb596-0
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.900
And it wouldn't platform
scrubbing the windows.

a8aa3e63-bdec-4f74-ad71-16d9600ff980-0
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.435
It looks like he dropped his hat
and it's falling down onto

a8aa3e63-bdec-4f74-ad71-16d9600ff980-1
00:12:41.435 --> 00:12:43.100
someone who's walking below.

39a7f8d6-7fde-4fde-a738-f66dd499b61b-0
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.810
In the distance there's a looks
like a.

62368de3-730a-48ff-ae31-a1b6a4a818de-0
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.668
A garage where cars are being
repaired. It's a green car with

62368de3-730a-48ff-ae31-a1b6a4a818de-1
00:12:54.668 --> 00:12:58.664
its hood up and again like a
blue overall person in the car

62368de3-730a-48ff-ae31-a1b6a4a818de-2
00:12:58.664 --> 00:13:02.660
with a bunch of tools and metal
parts laying on the ground.

7ec915ad-e552-4455-8bd9-41df945588ff-0
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.126
And. And there's a gas tank
outside, so maybe it's gas

7ec915ad-e552-4455-8bd9-41df945588ff-1
00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:08.899
station, someone standing by,
maybe the owner of the car

7ec915ad-e552-4455-8bd9-41df945588ff-2
00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:09.970
watching it get fixed.

366f5eac-fcf2-4a4e-8a4e-392556df521e-0
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.885
Uh, there's a fire engine house
with a fire truck and the doors

366f5eac-fcf2-4a4e-8a4e-392556df521e-1
00:13:13.885 --> 00:13:16.090
are open and a red fire truck is
coming out.

a5f23044-c20a-42ef-9f66-99a7283e953a-0

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.545
Uniform and a hat outside next
to that looks like a police

7e7272ab-8f75-4aab-acd0-ef0405d28a71-1
00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:27.683

uniforms coming in and out of a

00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:29.020
building. One person.

05839a72-dd37-4ced-aec2-c2f4703659f6-0
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.992
Has someone else with him?
Maybe, maybe someone who's been

05839a72-dd37-4ced-aec2-c2f4703659f6-1
00:13:31.992 --> 00:13:32.310
arrested.

1e966a2c-944b-4836-ab84-46d23c62d4bc-0
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.820
In the far, far back there's um
hospital.

ac169d13-62fa-4177-b667-f962645adda7-0
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.680
I see like a doctor and a white
coat and nurses and.

ab452d1d-dd44-4d82-9b05-09165ef16846-0
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.833
Um, so people are are on the
ground. They've been in a a bike

ab452d1d-dd44-4d82-9b05-09165ef16846-1
00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:50.338
accident and so the doctors and
nurses are rushing to help them.

ab452d1d-dd44-4d82-9b05-09165ef16846-2
00:13:50.338 --> 00:13:53.250
You see a white ambulance coming
out of the building.

92f0fdc6-edf7-4eee-adfe-1ced3302c9b2-0
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.391
There's another building with a
chain link fence around it and a

92f0fdc6-edf7-4eee-adfe-1ced3302c9b2-1
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:02.132
bunch of it looks like little
kids so and a clock on the wall

92f0fdc6-edf7-4eee-adfe-1ced3302c9b2-2
00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:05.270
above 2 big double doors so it
looks like a school.

9e540876-e33f-4f45-834e-a2aff5003e92-0
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.020
Um.

59c0a6d7-195f-45e6-8a20-d61039c9871d-0
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.810
And, um, there's some smoke
coming out of one of the houses.

40be624d-0986-47bc-ae70-1567dc873ab9-0
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.546
Might be a chimney, but there's
also looks like some

40be624d-0986-47bc-ae70-1567dc873ab9-1
00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:22.697
firefighters with hoses on a
house next door, so there could

40be624d-0986-47bc-ae70-1567dc873ab9-2
00:14:22.697 --> 00:14:23.990
be a fire going on.

a81b0e41-fdad-4750-8aca-34b04219eac4-0
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.610
And just a few other shops.
There's a Barber Barber shop.

866d4d8d-ca20-406d-b165-93866d8d64a0-0
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.030
With, you know, the Barber pole
out front.

a4d2fdb2-7256-4112-8369-c65a867fb5c3-0
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.550
And you know, outdoor restaurant
with the table.

8b78aa94-9e70-4fd3-83c9-da90eae73e27-0
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.910
And tables and chairs outside.
And a waiter pouring a drink.

8b78aa94-9e70-4fd3-83c9-da90eae73e27-1
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.531
Ohh. And then the big center of
all of this kind of town square

8b78aa94-9e70-4fd3-83c9-da90eae73e27-2
00:14:46.531 --> 00:14:47.550
is a big fountain.

fbb15977-03a4-4a4a-afc1-faf97ac6798d-0
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.148
And there's a person with a
snorkel and flippers riding

fbb15977-03a4-4a4a-afc1-faf97ac6798d-1
00:14:52.148 --> 00:14:55.790
sitting on the top of the
fountain. And people were.

c76589e6-f183-4c2c-b6ea-e041a6c74dc7-0
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.370
Walking by and looking at him,
and there's a statue with a.

953a4c51-649a-4655-853e-90540cf23225-0
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.620
Guy like looks like a Roman guy
with a bow and arrow.

65ecdf58-b750-414d-b21b-0d36dd4be932-0
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.837
#END_waldo-1 And the standing at

65ecdf58-b750-414d-b21b-0d36dd4be932-1
00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:11.230
square, which is actually a town
triangle.

084a59ae-41ec-40a1-b290-9e828ae521fc-0
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.890
{Yeah. So enough detail. Yep.
Perfect. Great. Thanks.

fbb583a0-4fbd-4ded-8c28-3b9383c4b27a-0
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.370
OK, next we have another short
story.

c5e3c4df-436e-4a8a-a8a7-5cea3aef4a11-0
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.120
OK, this one is 3 slides long.

18396a0d-3c72-41e6-b161-58657f99dd4c-0
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.020
OK.}

0e9bf261-cf2b-4c08-9efc-9376943e134f-0
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.780

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.150
#START_arrival-2 I've got some
people.

6276a267-aa0d-4520-b42f-26df950ce683-0
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.367
Sitting with shawls, looks like
they're traveling. Maybe a

6276a267-aa0d-4520-b42f-26df950ce683-1
00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:12.969
couple of women and a child. Two
children. There's some, some

6276a267-aa0d-4520-b42f-26df950ce683-2
00:16:12.969 --> 00:16:14.190
suitcases and trunks.

1e20fbfa-ed4d-4b3f-9a69-b1e7c17ce610-0
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.682
Uh, there's also some men in
dark suits and hats also sitting

1e20fbfa-ed4d-4b3f-9a69-b1e7c17ce610-1
00:16:19.682 --> 00:16:20.510

With Trunks um as a woman, um,

6b873511-1177-4d50-b28c-0d4c2080ea1b-0
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.820
Holding a baby.

04151f02-7453-420a-8e02-6b12f07b0fe8-0
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.590
Umm.

76433278-243d-4879-a404-82c90db45ee8-0
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.793
And then there's a man, he's got
a book open and he's writing in

76433278-243d-4879-a404-82c90db45ee8-1
00:16:36.793 --> 00:16:41.386
it. He's right-handed, he's got
a pen, he's writing something in

76433278-243d-4879-a404-82c90db45ee8-2
00:16:41.386 --> 00:16:43.859
it, and then he rips the page
out.

294af097-9cf7-4ee5-bcdc-0c2a4a2e4cb5-0
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.960
And, um, just to fold it.

6a841829-065f-46ba-a167-b5325700bff9-0
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.780
Into.

e71179b4-ef77-461f-b8b8-572f49b6bdde-0
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.382
A shape, and it turns out to be
a swan. She's made this paper

e71179b4-ef77-461f-b8b8-572f49b6bdde-1
00:16:54.382 --> 00:16:55.010

The the page that he wrote on
and.

4bde6fc8-dbe8-4752-b9a3-c04467b4a517-0
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.110
He's holding the swan. And then.

8839861d-2318-4757-8e96-ed8823a29743-0
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.510
Looks behind him.

4fdc2a6d-41a5-4f51-b4c6-71ebff9c165a-0
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.527
And gets up to walk. Ohh it
looks like this swan has has

4fdc2a6d-41a5-4f51-b4c6-71ebff9c165a-1
00:17:09.527 --> 00:17:11.010
flown away. Here's a little.

2e0f6197-2cc1-4798-9e05-994c6f7295aa-0
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.830
Paper Crane Um has flown away.

9e32a323-03c7-447a-8606-d50e18ac1a84-0
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.152
And he's looking around, he's
looking up in the sky and Sun's

9e32a323-03c7-447a-8606-d50e18ac1a84-1
00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:22.627
bright, kind of shading his
eyes. And then all of a sudden

9e32a323-03c7-447a-8606-d50e18ac1a84-2
00:17:22.627 --> 00:17:26.338
above the boat with all these
people on it are a ton of these,

9e32a323-03c7-447a-8606-d50e18ac1a84-3
00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:27.870
these birds, these flying.

2f53d1c9-f669-43b3-b53a-ea8f3f48a716-0
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.020
Birds that all look the same.

e032b3b1-04a4-4d6f-aba7-66d21a3360f9-0
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.054
And people are looking and
pointing at them as they fly

e032b3b1-04a4-4d6f-aba7-66d21a3360f9-1
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.320
over the the ship with its big
smokestacks.

25194da2-17c1-4604-ad0b-661476216591-0
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.734
And now we see the boat with all
these people and and big

25194da2-17c1-4604-ad0b-661476216591-1
00:17:46.734 --> 00:17:51.530
smokestacks. It's entering a
harbor of a huge city and the

25194da2-17c1-4604-ad0b-661476216591-2
00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.100
sky is.

cf3fed46-9fb6-4a49-a4a4-aa21c2bb50d6-0
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.881
This guy is cloudy and there the
birds are flying towards the

cf3fed46-9fb6-4a49-a4a4-aa21c2bb50d6-1
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:00.450
city and you can see tall
skyscrapers in the background.

78096408-fde0-4c8e-9aea-9dec549ebfe0-0
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.527

little house.

13110be1-c2f2-48df-a6a2-2c3d53d1d13b-0
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.174

And, um, this is we see the the
street where the man first came

579a8231-5060-4ca5-ba12-743fffd0fa64-1
00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:51.950

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.650
He's walking away from where he
was before.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.335
away from it and back up the
street from when he first came

0b5c622b-f623-4d7f-8ab6-d51fb587ebed-2
00:32:04.335 --> 00:32:04.730

f0589d39-1d09-41de-aada-fd091dc20aa3-0
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.645
The man is leaving, but it looks
like he gave her a purple flower

f0589d39-1d09-41de-aada-fd091dc20aa3-1
00:33:18.645 --> 00:33:22.020

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.800
From the man having given it to
them.

#START_unfriendly_giants OK, all
right, we've got a scene.

defdc101-7284-4d19-9e5f-f7db90a2905e-0
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.210
Of giants. It's called the
unfriendly giants.

317f1ff3-5634-4cce-9a6d-e197f6b906bf-0
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.661
And it says then Waldo and
Wizard White Beard came to the

317f1ff3-5634-4cce-9a6d-e197f6b906bf-1
00:34:35.661 --> 00:34:38.183
land of the unfriendly giants,
where many waldos had been

317f1ff3-5634-4cce-9a6d-e197f6b906bf-2
00:34:38.183 --> 00:34:40.009
before, and Waldo sought the
Giants were.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.390
Weirdly harassing little people.
And when he found the 10th

b384fe7d-b33b-47a6-af92-e3db51b69ef2-1
00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:45.600
scroll, it was time to continue
with his journey.

cc1fd1d9-bb8d-464e-aea3-959371d77040-0
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:51.410
So, um, it's we've got like a
great big field.

9105e00a-d2c5-41d1-bea7-51961cae931b-0

With bushes and hedges and a
hill with a.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.390
Like a small small castle or
keep.

22662ad9-f6d4-43ff-b2d9-793c66d5aaf6-0
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.700
And, excuse me, a windmill.

d1544dd0-90c8-4043-abf7-1a52a397065b-0
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.700
And these giants

9b5e0025-c60c-4c29-96c2-c9ef9ca8729b-0
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.282
Are running around all these
different places and there are

9b5e0025-c60c-4c29-96c2-c9ef9ca8729b-1
00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.360
tons of normal sized people.

6d4b8479-ccef-416a-8ae2-758094895ba6-0
00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:21.780

Kind of in between all these
giants and um.

9a978517-2a12-4782-8daa-51571243ce76-0
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.399
trying to deal with them. Some
of the giants are they have a

9a978517-2a12-4782-8daa-51571243ce76-1
00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:28.620
checkerboard and they're using
real people as pieces.

a341e335-8d27-4cd0-a005-4a9e38ee0ae3-0
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.970
And um, kind of swatting people
away who are trying to stop

a341e335-8d27-4cd0-a005-4a9e38ee0ae3-1
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:34.360
them.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.881
We have. It looks like maybe
there's a little pond or

76ccfc00-38b3-44ea-a9f8-54d0de772513-1
00:35:39.881 --> 00:35:43.500
something and a bunch of giants
have sucked up the water using

76ccfc00-38b3-44ea-a9f8-54d0de772513-2
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.430
straws and then they're spitting
it at the people.

f2079385-363b-4085-9a23-1944a520c601-0
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:47.990
Umm.

fdacf469-c802-464c-bed5-17ccab737060-0
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.390
There's a big siege tower with

There's another catapult.

6d8b153a-ef99-41d7-af58-145cf800d656-0
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.776
People have fired a rock at a
giant. It's bounced off the

6d8b153a-ef99-41d7-af58-145cf800d656-1

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.410
Doesn't look like he even really
stopped them.

6787b520-4943-4915-9c3e-d8b129f9e737-0
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.770

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.061
It's a it's a trap because
there's another siege tower with

93743597-fbde-470c-8b12-ba04c5d750ef-1
00:36:29.061 --> 00:36:31.240

Who's in love with this female
giant cut out.

d021f5c4-f56a-479c-be26-49df360252c8-0
00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.500
And then um.

8a6c06dc-1848-44db-8b82-4a41b14631b2-0
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.980

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.384
And um, a bunch of people
dragging behind him on a rope

7087c439-6c82-4b30-9d67-567bfc81ccf8-1
00:36:51.384 --> 00:36:54.600

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.090
Also, looks like they're doing
the trick too.

d86bc525-0cef-4fe2-8e71-9e9f1e55c0c1-0
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.068

00:37:10.068 --> 00:37:13.916
he's tipping his hat hat off to
a group of people. So he's

d86bc525-0cef-4fe2-8e71-9e9f1e55c0c1-2
00:37:13.916 --> 00:37:15.090

On the street, kind of using a
tree as it looks like, maybe a

2c5011d0-df3e-49b0-8da4-7e49be6e475b-1
00:37:22.414 --> 00:37:24.030

00:41:59.428 --> 00:42:03.119

00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:25.381
are following them and so they
have to get away again. So the

dab302da-de9d-4ece-8229-d8b451f72b67-2
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:26.920

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:52.669
They get to the top of a
snowcapped mountain and there's

928dc1c0-9959-417e-96e0-4af37024f461-1
00:46:52.669 --> 00:46:54.340

00:47:26.166 --> 00:47:26.740
this belt.

4fb4f56c-76eb-4bbc-ab4f-e470aab08aa1-0
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.876
But they're surrounded. The
King's soldiers and the blimp

4fb4f56c-76eb-4bbc-ab4f-e470aab08aa1-1
00:47:35.876 --> 00:47:40.091
creatures are flying around.
They have a cage to try to trap

4fb4f56c-76eb-4bbc-ab4f-e470aab08aa1-2
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:41.680

00:48:55.325 --> 00:48:58.020
creating this rainbow, knocking
the soldiers away.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.839

gone, and the people of the city

And the dragonfly flying
overhead, and the purple bird

26ec21a1-9a51-49ae-8af6-9232d22f7393-1
00:49:23.688 --> 00:49:27.220

00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:11.318

00:50:11.318 --> 00:50:15.065
the rain has stopped and a big

We have a man who has a chair in
the street and he's um.

f901c92d-7f2f-49a3-979f-4575438e38bd-0

he's saving this person well.

ea18642b-aea7-4ada-bccd-8b6f600e3241-0
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.510
Another child looks on.

9eb975d4-a120-41e9-b72a-8eaac7f66a76-0
00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:20.426
There are two musicians in the
street, one playing a accordion

9eb975d4-a120-41e9-b72a-8eaac7f66a76-1
00:52:20.426 --> 00:52:24.990
tuba phone kind of thing and
another like a fiddle. There's a

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:29.185
music stand holding some sheet
music and strange pigeons

00:52:29.185 --> 00:52:31.320
walking around on the bottom.

f35f3fe9-659c-4dfd-bf86-92d6ac87f955-0
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.670
There's a.

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:39.075
Looks like a shop or a
laundromat. There's some people

8957296f-5900-4339-ab06-1787dc2a0366-1
00:52:39.075 --> 00:52:39.510
sitting.

1e99d3b0-ed52-4256-b66e-d24bf17994f7-0
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.321
One woman was knitting and
another is looking through a

1e99d3b0-ed52-4256-b66e-d24bf17994f7-1
00:52:43.321 --> 00:52:43.590
book.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.010
Maybe telephone book or
something.

6b992e3b-622d-40df-a9b6-3693fa30a758-0
00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:53.050
And then we have a man in a dark
suit and a hat and a suitcase,

6b992e3b-622d-40df-a9b6-3693fa30a758-1
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:58.290
and he's standing in the middle
of the street, looking puzzled.

76a08595-366a-4284-9d24-a4f5a4904997-0
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:07.402
And he's checking his watch and
he's looking up at a clock

76a08595-366a-4284-9d24-a4f5a4904997-1
00:53:07.402 --> 00:53:07.840
tower.

3168bbf8-c922-40a5-ae48-d97829b0e188-0
00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:12.715
And um, he's walking along the
street and through different

3168bbf8-c922-40a5-ae48-d97829b0e188-1
00:53:12.715 --> 00:53:16.848
neighborhoods and it's getting
darker. And as it gets darker

3168bbf8-c922-40a5-ae48-d97829b0e188-2
00:53:16.848 --> 00:53:20.439
there, these like lights
floating in the air, and he

3168bbf8-c922-40a5-ae48-d97829b0e188-3
00:53:20.439 --> 00:53:24.301
reaches out to try to touch
phone and then they'll swarm

3168bbf8-c922-40a5-ae48-d97829b0e188-4
00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:27.080
past him and knock his hat off
his head.

18cbbc71-39c9-4676-9f0b-02ecc9c2ed8f-0
00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.710
And when he looks down, he picks
up his hat and there are arrows

18cbbc71-39c9-4676-9f0b-02ecc9c2ed8f-1
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.740
on the ground and he studies
them.

07446ec8-5adb-4ac1-a9fe-75dacc5fe503-0
00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.852
And these arrows, I think
they're giving directions to

07446ec8-5adb-4ac1-a9fe-75dacc5fe503-1
00:53:37.852 --> 00:53:39.900
point where different things
are.

b95cf8f1-1153-4ee4-82c7-6a6e193fb2b0-0
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:44.020
And so he gets out his book and
he's reading that and.

c0f1c931-021b-4a3b-87cd-bd5cb3a2a6f0-0
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:49.492
Someone comes along and offers a
hand out to him. Kind of like

c0f1c931-021b-4a3b-87cd-bd5cb3a2a6f0-1
00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:50.840
asking, are you lost?

7a139b9e-8c10-4c96-a935-dbf7efff74f6-0
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:53.260
And um.

dd923c19-c9a0-4a22-bc37-252c842b3cec-0
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:56.597
Looks like they're having
trouble, like they don't speak

dd923c19-c9a0-4a22-bc37-252c842b3cec-1
00:53:56.597 --> 00:53:57.650
the same language. Um.

bff3b666-6cba-4e10-8a6e-2f45b06f7b62-0
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.115
So they're having trouble
talking with each other. So

bff3b666-6cba-4e10-8a6e-2f45b06f7b62-1
00:54:02.115 --> 00:54:05.793
instead the the man with the hat
and the dark suit draws a

bff3b666-6cba-4e10-8a6e-2f45b06f7b62-2
00:54:05.793 --> 00:54:09.720
picture of a bed and points to
it and the man from the street.

d8bcc98c-278a-4b89-9e9b-22f374c70f52-0
00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.730
lifts his finger and says ah OK
I I can leads this.

76c119cd-80fe-4877-9bf0-6bc1c1a2f60d-0
00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:19.222
Moves his hands to show him he
can lead him for where to go,

76c119cd-80fe-4877-9bf0-6bc1c1a2f60d-1
00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:20.640

And I'll share my screen in one
second.}

c3189d1f-4b98-45db-a2c8-ec362d4f0f02-1
01:03:05.167 --> 01:03:08.962
like sitting at a an artist
board and he's drawing and

c3189d1f-4b98-45db-a2c8-ec362d4f0f02-2
01:03:08.962 --> 01:03:12.550
there's a red kite floating in
through the doorway.

935869ea-7211-416d-9a11-4de20c607817-0
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:17.310
Um, and the rest of the house is
empty. There's a cat.

7fe8c947-2985-4210-88dc-27ef2dfc24fd-0
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.522
I'm laying on a bed upstairs and
then the only other room that's

7fe8c947-2985-4210-88dc-27ef2dfc24fd-1
01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:26.560

Red ball, orange crown. And
she's drawing a doorway on her

931b5d84-06f3-4887-a8df-8ea30c4166b1-1
01:03:32.023 --> 01:03:32.430

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:46.720
And the dad looks around and he
sees the kite on the floor.

9752ab38-f193-4dbb-a10c-ea0d48e37020-0
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.826
He stops what he's doing and he
picks it up and he's kind of

9752ab38-f193-4dbb-a10c-ea0d48e37020-1
01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.122
like, hmm, looks like he's
thinking like we're just come

9752ab38-f193-4dbb-a10c-ea0d48e37020-2
01:03:52.122 --> 01:03:53.169
from and he leaves it and.

12a85088-522a-4c8f-b904-bbc38feb240f-0
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.046
He was looking for his daughter.
He goes into her room and

12a85088-522a-4c8f-b904-bbc38feb240f-1
01:03:57.046 --> 01:04:00.600
doesn't see her, but he sees the
red door. It's open and there's

12a85088-522a-4c8f-b904-bbc38feb240f-2
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.640
a light coming out.

7e0034fe-5ba3-4ed5-a0e5-41a8a78b9c04-0
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.540
Looking through it.

a764e2d9-0709-45a2-9fc0-101b507e2162-0
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:07.090

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.763
And he comes out into a forest.
Magical forest with lanterns

b2a95218-4d55-496c-8423-51b3688e8a11-1
01:04:12.763 --> 01:04:14.470
hanging through the trees.

bdbfbbeb-cbfc-41f5-bafb-70535b7e5de6-0
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.580
And very thick trees, um.

7063b070-dc0d-4965-bda5-7b19d3de7348-0
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:22.310
So you can't see the sky and
there's a river.

e831f940-773b-40ae-983d-27906d1a11e5-0
01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:27.992

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:41.452
And he goes to the end of the
dock and he picks up the ball

4e80832b-8e56-4c3e-94b5-48b34b09f895-1
01:04:41.452 --> 01:04:45.900
and as he does he looks down the
the river and a big boat.

17a827d4-00f2-40ba-9657-26348f3006eb-0
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.510

Um, like an animal

e0681b15-1191-4ae2-85dc-57612991bb0e-0
01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:57.177
Statue kind of shape at the
front and a tail at the back

e0681b15-1191-4ae2-85dc-57612991bb0e-1
01:04:57.177 --> 01:05:01.440
end. The boat pulls up and stops
at the dock and he gets on and

e0681b15-1191-4ae2-85dc-57612991bb0e-2
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.640
sails off with it.

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:13.606
And he's taken 2 a big kingdom
with the huge towers and castles

815e0360-3620-480a-a88f-34884d47b504-1
01:05:13.606 --> 01:05:13.980

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.626
Um, you know, bridges over this
river and and he sees way on the

8523655a-f6ad-4513-aa77-ddc056097d0c-1
01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:22.273
distance. He sees his daughter
on a red boat with her orange

8523655a-f6ad-4513-aa77-ddc056097d0c-2
01:05:22.273 --> 01:05:23.170
crown, sailing.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.830
On across one of these bridges.

9fa6e41f-0b8b-4ba0-b4aa-e1f2e99e89b1-0

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:35.729
And he jumps out of the boat
just as she is walking up some

bfb1791d-ec98-4863-aa6f-25af0e8f0f8f-1
01:05:35.729 --> 01:05:40.388

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.690
And um.

caad0a8a-f93f-4561-abfc-c4131e45a078-0
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.627
Looks like he's trying to talk
to her, but she doesn't want to

caad0a8a-f93f-4561-abfc-c4131e45a078-1
01:05:52.627 --> 01:05:55.735

is ignoring him. She's got her
arms crossed and she's looking

caad0a8a-f93f-4561-abfc-c4131e45a078-3
01:05:58.793 --> 01:05:59.040

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:13.166
Out of the boat that came in,
uh, some soldiers appear and

22630c11-0cac-4e0b-99b0-893d5cbbdd52-1
01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:15.270

up his orange chalk that stands

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.600
And she has drawn a submarine
with a pair and she's looking

dc61662f-6791-430d-b2d7-502a1708b874-1
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.377
out the Periscope with the dad
drives it and they're going

dc61662f-6791-430d-b2d7-502a1708b874-2
01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:41.530
through the water.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.050
um trying to find some place to
go.

dc790b1c-29e8-4669-9557-823fbdf46fd0-0

01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:54.510
And the get into a cave. And the
land, the boats.

d47730ff-96f6-44d3-a7fd-92d1cdc6fe1b-0
01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.740
And um.

9aaa30e8-e8e9-4411-a39d-0f1ac348113d-0
01:08:57.690 --> 01:09:01.740
There are all these cave
paintings drawn on the walls.

1b831be1-b0bd-4df2-a469-3a39e827b576-0
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:06.310
Kind of staring at them and
checking them out.

dc72ef20-f458-43ea-829c-258ac97b9343-0
01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:09.250

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:16.911
The girl points excitedly to the
pictures because she sees one

b37539ae-3b17-4a56-9ddc-a8f400092994-1
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:17.340
that.

135b576b-7630-40cb-9624-446d353c1332-0
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:21.953
Looks exactly what's happening
the it looks like the general

135b576b-7630-40cb-9624-446d353c1332-1
01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:24.270
with the machine sucking up the
chalk.

a4792955-5da0-4db7-b7d7-194f543c469b-0
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.630
And while she's showing the dad.

ed9ae50f-14e7-4348-843e-f815b4e33fce-0
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:32.787
This, uh, the bird is sitting,
looking out of The Cave

ed9ae50f-14e7-4348-843e-f815b4e33fce-1
01:09:32.787 --> 01:09:33.330
entrance.

604c64e9-4667-46e7-9525-81849e7b7ec9-0

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.672
And the general and his soldiers
have found them. And he's

1ce2c99a-5fcb-4a3b-950c-624f2cefef9f-1
01:09:43.672 --> 01:09:47.959
outside The Cave entrance. And
the girl's hiding behind a rock.

1ce2c99a-5fcb-4a3b-950c-624f2cefef9f-2
01:09:47.959 --> 01:09:50.840
And the dad gets an idea and he
takes the.

fbe1ad20-f60d-4f58-a0d0-b1ef97efe53c-0
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:56.122
Um takes like the green green
chalk, I guess, and he starts to

fbe1ad20-f60d-4f58-a0d0-b1ef97efe53c-1
01:09:56.122 --> 01:09:56.470
draw.

01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:58.040
Um.

f6541d56-df1d-4a5d-9e3f-73b7ec887126-0
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.393
Kind of a doorway with a cage
hanging down, the bird cage

f6541d56-df1d-4a5d-9e3f-73b7ec887126-1
01:10:02.393 --> 01:10:04.330
hanging down on the center of
it.

c76458e5-b28c-4044-9974-a7707bb4fc87-0
01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.670
And next page.

9f76790c-ce2c-4033-b418-11d1d1053c38-0
01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.322
And um, the general runs up and
um starts to suck the bird into

9f76790c-ce2c-4033-b418-11d1d1053c38-1
01:10:16.322 --> 01:10:21.449
his box. And as he gets the
bird, he steps into the middle

9f76790c-ce2c-4033-b418-11d1d1053c38-2
01:10:21.449 --> 01:10:25.100
of the cage and it turns out
it's a trap.

f487594a-3707-40ed-8eb8-c2174d82a569-0
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.520
And the trap

ff244068-b792-4c3f-b2a8-705e8d8e5f5a-0
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.739
shuts and traps the general in
it, and the dad has the box in

ff244068-b792-4c3f-b2a8-705e8d8e5f5a-1
01:10:31.739 --> 01:10:34.820
his hands and I, you know,
holding it overhead.

5e4907e7-8280-4a62-91b2-ded96da6b637-0
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.602
And as he smashes it on the
ground, all the colors come out

5e4907e7-8280-4a62-91b2-ded96da6b637-1
01:10:44.602 --> 01:10:44.860
the.

f891a647-1188-4fb7-afa5-37036957944d-0
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.081
The winged creature, and the
yellow and green and blue and

f891a647-1188-4fb7-afa5-37036957944d-1
01:10:49.081 --> 01:10:52.663
the bird is free and all these
other animals, and there's a

f891a647-1188-4fb7-afa5-37036957944d-2
01:10:52.663 --> 01:10:53.320
huge light.

b185304f-bf3e-4f05-9af1-86c951318864-0
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.560
Um and the boy and the King have
run up.

b762d99f-dba2-493e-9b70-74dea7fe8b8f-0
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:07.430
And as the general sails away

aa678281-94b1-4122-8002-fb7619fb7d51-0
01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:12.530
Um, all these colorful creatures
are flying away. Um, the king

aa678281-94b1-4122-8002-fb7619fb7d51-1
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:16.920
and the boy and the dad and the
the girl watched this boat go.

9ed5e43e-77e1-412f-8543-3b891e468821-0
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.951
And now the girl was really
happy with her dad and she gives

9ed5e43e-77e1-412f-8543-3b891e468821-1
01:11:20.951 --> 01:11:22.050
him a great big hug.

656c8be8-c5f8-4e15-9fb1-a00d76cba136-0
01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.495
Um, and down near them is a
little door with a kite tail

656c8be8-c5f8-4e15-9fb1-a00d76cba136-1
01:11:26.495 --> 01:11:27.650
hanging out of it.

ab3afbd7-835e-46c5-8ec5-2681213aa140-0
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.875
And they came out of the door
and into the dad's study where

ab3afbd7-835e-46c5-8ec5-2681213aa140-1
01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:38.900
he was working.

a022bddf-ffc3-43e8-b757-8acfb4a4f8d4-0
01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.277
But now he's no longer in the
study because he's, uh, you see

a022bddf-ffc3-43e8-b757-8acfb4a4f8d4-1
01:11:43.277 --> 01:11:44.670
the kite flying outside.

510580ef-f580-4eae-b3d1-78cadc36df31-0
01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.517
#END_return So it looks like he
and his daughter are outside

510580ef-f580-4eae-b3d1-78cadc36df31-1
01:11:47.517 --> 01:11:48.260
playing with the kite.

93c1e20f-3445-4901-b8ed-fa6ce25887e5-0
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.640
{OK. I'll pull up what's next,

86e82e71-38db-4a6b-b87d-8ebc316d2369-0
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:04.100
OK, next we have a complex
scene.

7b82ffa3-32d1-4dcb-ae07-352e31a52fab-0
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:05.390
OK.}

6354572d-d018-4489-8544-9c9d0a7661a8-0
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:25.440


d79d8d0c-08df-4a8b-b129-a7e926e03484-0
01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.039
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
this one says escape from the

d79d8d0c-08df-4a8b-b129-a7e926e03484-1
01:12:41.039 --> 01:12:41.230
zoo.

0bf61169-534f-4d7f-b1a5-832d80edf764-0
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.340
And, um, it's a picture of
different areas inside a zoo.

d62232b8-2bab-4fe3-a631-2fe70f88d762-0
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.720
Um, we've got different
enclosures and.

d4e332e5-c3f8-48df-9f99-7c5ded56c1f4-0
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.676
Uh, the sidewalks, uh, between
them got animals in the cages

d4e332e5-c3f8-48df-9f99-7c5ded56c1f4-1
01:12:58.676 --> 01:13:00.930
and people on the sidewalks and.

93269b47-f65d-4e17-94c4-1906f5548226-0
01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:05.817
Some buildings in the
background. So we have a a cage

93269b47-f65d-4e17-94c4-1906f5548226-1
01:13:05.817 --> 01:13:10.772
with zebras and flamingos and
hippopotamuses. We have one with

93269b47-f65d-4e17-94c4-1906f5548226-2
01:13:10.772 --> 01:13:13.840
a looks like a male and a female
lion.

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.569
There's some people in that one
trying to climb the wall and get

20b82ac4-872c-4f20-a713-5b8f3a97c2fe-1
01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:18.750

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.390
Like one person is jumping in.

7e575394-61a3-49e0-8156-54112dcff4ed-0
01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.280
with a smile on his face.

7b53fb26-e6c8-4e89-952a-2d9aaf4ebf99-0
01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:27.306
Ohh um, there's a rhinoceros
loose in the on the sidewalk and

7b53fb26-e6c8-4e89-952a-2d9aaf4ebf99-1
01:13:27.306 --> 01:13:30.600
it's running through and it's
scaring a bunch of people and.

c4d62533-68af-4a6f-9b66-a41359e8e21c-0
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.980
Snakes, even who are running
away from it and.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.729
People were trying to jump in
the lion cage to get away from

6d708d39-e18f-42fc-b196-102499c8039a-1
01:13:36.729 --> 01:13:36.830

There is an enclosure with a
giraffe, 2 giraffes, 3 giraffes.

Like an anteater and some other
African animals, I think it's a

0736f548-79eb-47c3-92a5-444e64c633a8-1

One of the persons around that
enclosure is shaking food into

The enclosure, which the animals
are looking at hungrily.

9f3f7529-4596-49d2-a758-c26966079aaf-0
01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.917
There's a yellow and blue and
green bird like a toucan kind of

A little little airplane with a
little propeller airplane.

Monkeys or apes and one is kind
of dancing and.

ed47a467-f928-4248-ae1e-b7628ecbbc9e-0

01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:50.577
The mailbox rises up into the
sky with a balloon, causing it

b597ebce-10de-443d-b63e-491ebed851c3-1
01:27:50.577 --> 01:27:51.330
to levitate.

9038ab52-a21f-4fa6-9339-fa7b9327bff2-0
01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.552
And it's flying away. It's the
man and his little pet creature

9038ab52-a21f-4fa6-9339-fa7b9327bff2-1
01:27:55.552 --> 01:27:56.500

01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:03.380
And then we see a leaf.

0ffbb735-af4b-413c-887d-457c6d1fdbae-0

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:17.308
out, and then the leaves shrivel
with the flowers left and it

434b169d-7b06-4e2b-a423-3c8a242584eb-2
01:28:17.308 --> 01:28:21.154
blooms and it's like a
dandelion. It's got all these

434b169d-7b06-4e2b-a423-3c8a242584eb-3

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:27.560
Fuzzy seeds that start to to
shake off and blow away.

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:33.300

normal flower with petals.

01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:46.542
And the seeds are falling on the
ground and then the flower

f894b158-bd03-4835-896c-97a5d6d5b911-1

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:52.090
As it looks like the snow comes
back and then it's falling apart

b6e2250c-5242-49a4-8b28-7643cbd51fa1-1
01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:55.495

An outline of the shape of the
flower, and it's buried in the

f99ef9a2-9d83-4a28-8cd4-7105f91b81ce-1
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.150

another gentleman's waving high.

e5deed15-cc3e-47d5-ace8-d3853f43ba0e-0
01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.594
And he says, oh, no, no thank
you, he's trying to find bread.

e5deed15-cc3e-47d5-ace8-d3853f43ba0e-1
01:39:48.594 --> 01:39:50.240

And then they're looking at a
fish and the boy has a horn with

01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:49.704
And then the boy whispers to his
dad and the dad and the man

39671dc8-5d03-4771-a516-f98e3436fa7e-1
01:40:49.704 --> 01:40:51.160

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:58.740
The boy is pointing and they're
inviting him to go with.

183d8c7d-403b-4e4f-a8ea-8262da4c6617-0
01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.780

And so he follows them down to
the rowboats.

92a7c55c-df3f-4dea-92b1-410f5305c74c-0
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:08.090
At the edge of the the ocean.

e878d836-f345-4e91-9b50-8857b78616bb-0
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:14.980
And they go to their rowboat and
there's a big vase.

adb4fd46-c760-4eb1-a7fe-941e12a8048c-0

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.634
Uh, the the man in the hat is
scared of the the creature, but

01c44efb-3505-4ba2-bf53-4761d31f91d9-1
01:41:37.634 --> 01:41:39.260

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:48.820
So the man with the hat draws a
picture of a dragon in the sky.

f85a1412-3a63-4ebf-ba64-2bd0b0a43963-0
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:52.150
