00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.730
There we go.

cd5dd71a-d65f-4662-b745-55c15ac38d24-0
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.310
This is being recorded.

842b4e24-f7df-448e-bc5b-dc63d66ec4c5-0
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.890
Got.

6bc3d6bb-412a-4608-8319-60a48a7862f8-0
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.862
OK, so our first item today is
a complex scene and I'm just

6bc3d6bb-412a-4608-8319-60a48a7862f8-1
00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:17.320
going to pull up the.

f44c147f-afeb-496a-8ad2-6789f363f4b9-0
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.112
Pull up the directions just as
like your voice is coming

f44c147f-afeb-496a-8ad2-6789f363f4b9-1
00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:24.580
across.

56661923-a072-4459-b218-dfe2cc0410ee-0
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.390
Your voice is coming across
very distorted.

73f3c215-290d-43c9-b086-67adec4ad454-0
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.160
Umm.

e8380b1c-f457-415e-b3f2-562e0387a7d7-0
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.700
Let me see.

a323e965-bf6b-4d4c-bdfb-2fb768581b28-0
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.040
Does it sound a little better
now?

b1cb6ea1-5fc6-4d57-96b6-4210906d0275-0
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.690
Yeah, a little.

8e80701d-5d57-4197-8990-029d4acf457c-0
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.480
It's breaking up. It's it's
it's it's scratchy.

c82304ad-c101-427c-b80c-b72b45fca37a-0
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.400
OK.

7d76e1d8-4557-486e-960e-0ae79e01fe23-0
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.748
And and the the little I can
see your lips move before I hear

7d76e1d8-4557-486e-960e-0ae79e01fe23-1
00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:02.340
the voice.

4f94d065-e60c-43d1-ac17-c9c6774abc17-0
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.880
Oh, OK.

c849cfb1-cda5-49f2-95d1-b3b472a61c46-0
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.990
I don't know. I will live with
it, but I.

5d1024c4-6cd6-4043-af0f-31cd1ef13e7e-0
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.081
Yeah. Is there anything
important you need to know? Then

5d1024c4-6cd6-4043-af0f-31cd1ef13e7e-1
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:19.000
then e-mail it.

552f896e-89cc-4d91-9ec6-0956908fe206-0
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.340
OK.

f00990e9-ed07-48bd-b5cc-a4167b44b315-0
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.954
OK, so today we're starting off
with a complex scene and I'm

f00990e9-ed07-48bd-b5cc-a4167b44b315-1
00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:37.046
just going to show you the
directions for a complex scene

f00990e9-ed07-48bd-b5cc-a4167b44b315-2
00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:37.540
again.

321342fd-614c-47f1-bd1e-05753f058391-0
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.290
So you are going to describe a
complex scene.

516c2edc-735d-40ae-9446-1057602dfd04-0
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.038
Imagine you were describing the
scene to somebody who could not

516c2edc-735d-40ae-9446-1057602dfd04-1
00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:46.700
see the picture.

26797fb7-79b5-4b88-a83c-ae6f4385adda-0
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.258
Picture describe what is
happening and what you see in

26797fb7-79b5-4b88-a83c-ae6f4385adda-1
00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:56.166
the scene as thoroughly as
possible, and then you'll have

26797fb7-79b5-4b88-a83c-ae6f4385adda-2
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.320
three to five minutes.

160975c6-011b-40c3-8900-deae7d7dbc95-0
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.970
Am I still breaking up a lot?

a60c7160-f2a1-4a11-97c6-b4ba2025ca4a-0
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.290
OK.

808868ff-b10d-4e0b-95b6-387be6f80ed8-0
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.430
Yes. Yeah.

5ba441ac-8ea6-4a4b-a144-2a050b5b477b-0
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.949
It's OK. I can I can understand
just saying it's just there's a

5ba441ac-8ea6-4a4b-a144-2a050b5b477b-1
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.220
delay in the break up.

b8864db6-c097-4794-bac2-bcf93fff0ba3-0
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.240
OK.

51b2608d-0364-4159-b222-2c13ac8bfe36-0
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.550
I'm just trying to think of
what.

29e876d1-1155-45fd-b960-d11cf0e7c6a1-0
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.200
{I could fix.}

9b2753d3-71c9-4514-995b-8759489ed986-0
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.430
I'm just making sure I'm on the
right Wi-Fi. I am.

c8e65d44-3e6b-43d3-87fb-c8927d074410-0
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.360
Change no.

aec8422b-c54e-4038-ba61-f5670cfc3621-0
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.960
OK, so now I'm going to share.

d2b6eb39-cba0-46dc-b0a8-dc5a6923a495-0
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.060
Oh, see, I kind of heard that.

c886aff6-f3b7-4672-9210-74ca1c7aa99d-0
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.480
OK, so I'm going to share this
picture and then.

b8c1d88d-46bf-4f13-8e9f-1af5f27a7274-0
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.380
Just for you to describe it in
three to five minutes.

271d3988-2065-4caa-a69d-9b9d7bde8999-0
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.790
As best you can.

b0c03bd3-2e73-4ebc-81fc-206c434217a0-0
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.020
OK.

c8cd9f3f-8b13-4d4f-9ce7-a496fe545801-0
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.120
That is large as you make it.

f7aef31c-991b-4b4e-b65b-db189ee80572-0
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.810
I could zoom in.

901642b7-9284-4ca8-8c38-4d110747305c-0
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.130
OK, so I'll be ready whenever
you're ready.

865ebd8c-e58c-47b3-855b-f58ccdef29fc-0
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.753
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
describing the scene, but it's

865ebd8c-e58c-47b3-855b-f58ccdef29fc-1
00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:38.110
very chaotic, very powerful.

08fd5264-2b17-4247-bfa7-bcc30dfd0b3c-0
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.848
Oh God it seems to be indoors
for the volcano model volcano.

08fd5264-2b17-4247-bfa7-bcc30dfd0b3c-1
00:03:44.848 --> 00:03:48.750
It may not be until they look to
be inside.

c0bd97b0-7665-4f85-87b1-a6dd9ef506c0-0
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.970
Like Conference Center with
stalls at and.

59218949-ef5a-443d-ba03-d2e568575218-0
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.250
Just just.

05f5a1a2-3e25-4899-82f8-d1d909bc8770-0
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.273
Room walls, rather than within a
large building, there's hundreds

05f5a1a2-3e25-4899-82f8-d1d909bc8770-1
00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:04.010
of people.

053a4c95-e7b6-4709-a3a9-1a702ed824bb-0
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.570
It splitted 2 halves.

3dc61253-1356-4feb-bfe1-6b672328e374-0
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.320
And.

ad0412e2-f676-4edb-a8d8-70c21e1adc23-0
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.250
It's titled Dinosaurs, Spacemen
and ghouls

6d19eedc-4af5-4dbc-ac4e-e18b7989db0d-0
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.400
Which seems a bit right. We've
got a volcano with.

9ad8179d-8324-4b25-96f4-1407aac5726f-0
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.172
Cavemen leaving into the lava
coming out and smoke cave in

9ad8179d-8324-4b25-96f4-1407aac5726f-1
00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:32.200
with wooden clubs, leaping and
down climbing up the volcano.

1e2e534d-d066-4bea-b211-2f6cfd67d858-0
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.130
Climbing down volcano.

419d8e24-d92e-461b-bd79-68913d6aae40-0
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.403
Dressed as you would expect in
animal skin, look like the

419d8e24-d92e-461b-bd79-68913d6aae40-1
00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:41.110
Flintstones.

af3160c3-9438-4fe0-bf4f-5f81939fd19e-0
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.827
All the scores of the milling
around on this volcano. So on

af3160c3-9438-4fe0-bf4f-5f81939fd19e-1
00:04:47.827 --> 00:04:50.190
the volcano a dinosaurs.

a7a7c570-d845-4f96-8c54-4b954b988787-0
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.640
peculiarly colored blue ones and
red ones, green ones.

e4b8476c-2b50-474e-9d05-7ce939a805c0-0
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.062
There's one that looks like a
giant gorilla dinosaur leaning

e4b8476c-2b50-474e-9d05-7ce939a805c0-1
00:05:00.062 --> 00:05:03.774
back with his chin on his elbow,
looking very relaxed, just

e4b8476c-2b50-474e-9d05-7ce939a805c0-2
00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:06.310
surveying the line he's sitting
next to.

2e566706-3e85-4d01-b62d-2f983aa5d8b1-0
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.000
Bright green dinosaur where the
caveman is.

8394372a-b184-4780-9306-a841516e87d3-0
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.890
Drawing some graffiti on the
side of the green dinosaur.

5fa0ee41-ff3b-4496-b391-1746d6a54240-0
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.830
There are two actually seen 

be768bf1-92ff-4ad5-9dee-ddf6931cd8e2-0
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.850
Little uncaring.

f0588e47-7c4a-47db-a569-39454bda55fd-0
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.250
Uh.

66acf9d3-d325-41e2-bd82-ec141a38b26d-0
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.050
There is big pink dinosaur, that
is all.

514a3e32-d01f-44bb-99c4-54a12ad85ac4-0
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.424
And a small dinosaurs and you
friend with the cavemen down

514a3e32-d01f-44bb-99c4-54a12ad85ac4-1
00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:31.930
below in the scene.

f6ea5af3-db9a-4539-b74f-15712cbe39d4-0
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.538
All the three bit like a party
rather than anyone being {oops

f6ea5af3-db9a-4539-b74f-15712cbe39d4-1
00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:37.940
gone.}

4dad2511-0dfc-469d-92a5-5828e7459197-0
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.870
{But back again.}

734085e1-5fec-454e-a911-b038dc8794af-0
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.740


90ba52e3-aa31-44c1-96bd-70ab670a719b-0
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.730
It is more like a party rather
than people being.

0b3e0d4a-c03e-4cb8-8418-5a6e91213678-0
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.120
You know, devoured by the
creatures.

24607b9e-2863-47c0-9662-cc99102a3e32-0
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.590
Hold on this left hand side side
of the.

1b8d7c85-b1a7-4b2a-a93f-a3501fc61899-0
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.410
it looks to be a film set.

2e47e57d-c7e6-4017-bc74-11047b593fa6-0
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.790
Don't see any cameras. There's
lots of.

2fb7ac2c-3961-4898-8227-114a8d50c310-0
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.810
Lights that you would expect on
a building. The cameras working.

f9a8b4aa-ae47-47d9-88fa-8511d1732dfa-0
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.557
The proposition I'm sure there
are. And maybe the dinosaurs are

f9a8b4aa-ae47-47d9-88fa-8511d1732dfa-1
00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:20.270
actors dressed up.

e0a93c05-cfba-44f2-8688-acbf0be33b15-0
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.970
You can see it on the screen
there are.

bdb80881-cc57-47b2-9b3a-1170bc9df78b-0
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.020
cavemen getting their makeup
line in front of.

9e30522d-6d7d-4430-b06f-2ce775b1f311-0
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.074
Mirrors with these four or five
light bulbs of mirror like

9e30522d-6d7d-4430-b06f-2ce775b1f311-1
00:06:38.074 --> 00:06:43.548
start. There's a door out from
the medium into the main area

9e30522d-6d7d-4430-b06f-2ce775b1f311-2
00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:48.932
where all the people are, the
big Gold Star at the door. So

9e30522d-6d7d-4430-b06f-2ce775b1f311-3
00:06:48.932 --> 00:06:53.150
presumably that's, that's that's

Actors again betray their
partners? Really. Very.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.750
Busy scene.

db54df86-75cd-4c2c-bf3a-cc232282b00d-0
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.830
My next slide of this of of the
bull spread.

36ffea65-aa0d-46d8-92a7-e35b67159bd1-0
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.417
There's a backdrop becoming the
gold blue screen films, but it's

36ffea65-aa0d-46d8-92a7-e35b67159bd1-1
00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:14.570
blue-green screen. Rather, it's
exactly blue in color.

13e025ce-0c54-4ecc-9578-406375e70111-0
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.940
With a.

c07fc3c4-5f05-4b53-a3ea-eaf506cfe1bb-0
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.402
Ships on it like a giant
wallpaper. They just happened

c07fc3c4-5f05-4b53-a3ea-eaf506cfe1bb-1
00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:26.047
known and left to right and
Cavemen hanging their ropes

c07fc3c4-5f05-4b53-a3ea-eaf506cfe1bb-2
00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:31.025
under the three ships and as
they crashed, rocket ship nose

c07fc3c4-5f05-4b53-a3ea-eaf506cfe1bb-3
00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:32.850
first into the ground.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.380
spacemen falling out it

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.290
There's no flames. It's crashed.
There are people floating.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.180

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.520
By disease.

bc4cc9fa-5fc8-4ef6-9e1b-8fc68f307d7d-0
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.070
Below them there's an over from
the previous half the page.

863e8b09-22eb-4a6e-a331-49886981c278-0
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.640
Caveman can't see any dinosaurs
on the part of the page.

21dff17a-e4fb-48ef-ac47-4376730fb858-0
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.605
But you can leave the the film
crew working feverishly behind

21dff17a-e4fb-48ef-ac47-4376730fb858-1
00:08:08.605 --> 00:08:09.650
the scenes.

1c5093b9-4c77-437f-acc9-dd4ec3d270a8-0
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.522
Carrying these, the road, the
cannon, the human cannonball is

1c5093b9-4c77-437f-acc9-dd4ec3d270a8-1
00:08:14.522 --> 00:08:18.674
in the top corner. He's going to
appear somewhere in the space,

1c5093b9-4c77-437f-acc9-dd4ec3d270a8-2
00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:20.750
and I think there's also a ship.

44dee35e-90e0-44e4-b64d-f2b9dcca5187-0
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.900
But rather, I think floating in
the sky with spaceships.

f71c76ab-b57d-41be-ad0f-b4b0115b9b11-0
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.396
Below all of that, I think
there's the looks like a

f71c76ab-b57d-41be-ad0f-b4b0115b9b11-1
00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:33.330

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:40.034
Busy feeding all the in the of
the page for the weekend is

42b4910b-4ddf-4d70-badc-88d9a5d38cf0-1
00:08:40.034 --> 00:08:42.780
going on, going on behind them.

1930eedd-28b3-4bb6-8901-2c97ff7dc762-0
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.530
Although there's a tree as
another creature

813f5fe2-3537-4c4a-ad79-dbdc852c9676-0
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.200
There seems to be a tree with
with or or a tree.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.670
Both of you.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.730
Somebody is inside it.

if you will adjust to that.}

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.660
I suppose there's probably 100
people in this scene, all small

3beaea24-1a15-40d9-8fbc-a11288cd2195-1
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.270
characters all doing their own
thing. There's a.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.520
Red green or pink or blue?

40382ee1-0901-4073-87d3-c2aa6bb09bad-0
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.960
Dinosaur look very they don't
look very, very, very dangerous.

bandages, walking in there with

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.380
them. Three of them.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.524
I think the Mad Hollywood scene
behind the scenes from

d40f409f-f940-4acc-b10f-023e196e65e4-1
00:09:47.524 --> 00:09:52.476
Hollywood. There's several films
all over lapping one as its

00:09:52.476 --> 00:09:57.185
title and all spacemen and
ghouls, many ghouls, maybe the

d40f409f-f940-4acc-b10f-023e196e65e4-3
00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.890
ghouls and the ghouls

lots.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.030
OK, perfect.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.850
Now let me pull up the next
one.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.697
OK, I found it. OK, I'm gonna
share my screen. It's another

00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:54.720
complex scene.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.218
So same thing as before, just
describe it for three to five

d426a21b-1309-4c8e-93ef-5cc49cb5c692-1
00:11:00.218 --> 00:11:02.390

you're ready.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.013
OK, right. OK. #START_picture_this The complex scene has
lots and lots going on and it looks

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.432
Pick the look at all these
framed portraits. For me, that's

bdc17761-3828-4b57-8d7e-11f25a57ff9a-1
00:11:40.432 --> 00:11:41.310

Some who are here elsewhere in

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.381

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.340
Two sumo wrestlers.

2ecdc4fb-ba77-4604-bfc4-34cc3a1db4e8-0
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.700

stealing the boy.

different things that appear
twice and I'm going to find

8733ac3f-9904-4b08-a688-6d63aef6867f-2
00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:06.710
them. There's a cactus.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.453
The caveman is. He's working. It
had to. I think he didn't think

3896370d-80fb-454d-9176-0ff7ee6dc0b3-1
00:15:24.453 --> 00:15:27.660

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.469
Everybody

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.958
I think that's about all I'm
getting out of this. It's a

8ed402c7-dd27-4a1c-95a0-7a15f6d40112-1
00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.660
little bit confusing to be
honest. There's so much going

Big Red truck and it used to be
a fire engine.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.397
That there are people on the
roofs of these people arguing

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:48.110

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:12.574
Maybe a very impressive, self
impressed person, the top of the

00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:18.286

A busy Town Center
in the middle of the day, with

00:22:17.817 --> 00:22:21.818

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.860
I can see how they could.

00:23:56.814 --> 00:24:00.599
there are some vines hanging off
the boats, and maybe there's a

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:04.266
breathing tubes. Maybe not all
the fears you might maybe some

themselves into a smiley face

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.543
Not sure why the people were on
fire while there is a fire, but

153d8d56-9d86-476f-bfd6-39cc3cc75c51-1
00:28:47.543 --> 00:28:50.190

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:21.471
The man on the wing, waving his
arm and some purple stuff,

804951fa-9ed4-4794-b1fb-9630692dafcb-1
00:29:21.471 --> 00:29:23.760

88e166e4-ec87-4abe-875a-4935e32f3d70-1
00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:39.544
another baggage cart train and
there's water bears that seems I

has run over this training hose

88e166e4-ec87-4abe-875a-4935e32f3d70-3
00:29:44.958 --> 00:29:46.420

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.608
And there are two people on top
of this airplane. Not sure why

07f7f63b-60ff-48ae-bec8-93a664b269c4-1
00:29:52.608 --> 00:29:55.693

Looking in all directions, we
were knocking, was looking in

846f88c6-b9cd-4976-a734-5052109a6a1d-1

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.970
There's an airplane with front.

3ed2d1a2-ecdd-40a0-99f9-04046679df0e-0

00:30:52.771 --> 00:30:53.400
the suitcases.

e209b0ea-7cdf-4bd6-8b7c-befc004cb527-0
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.533
Again, going in all directions
at the same time, no common

e209b0ea-7cdf-4bd6-8b7c-befc004cb527-1
00:31:00.533 --> 00:31:01.040

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.168
No, don't. It's smoke people.
The airport crew are hiding

73a3cec5-649e-4a6d-bf15-3abcc6a3307c-1
00:31:13.168 --> 00:31:14.240

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.288
These sneaky cigarettes. But we
can leave the smoke wafting

8d0c2af4-c9e0-4a3b-81fa-6a073e67c110-1
00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:21.650

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.610
It's all very well,
a small red plane in the

0e17fe95-4483-4cb1-a290-a40526bf4de1-1
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.580

scene.

bd13eef3-c756-4d1b-aff7-945771ad61b3-0

00:32:22.622 --> 00:32:25.280
3 to 5 minutes to describe what
you see.

7cb1d798-0017-4dd0-9113-a1383878c68b-0

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.574
OK, well another complex scene
is for the two pages.

52c6898e-204b-4f85-905a-bfed7cd68ce1-1
00:32:39.574 --> 00:32:44.051

00:32:48.454 --> 00:32:51.290
stumbled upon a birthday
celebration.

ebe5659b-d242-4af4-975f-6eba5f323e3c-0
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.718
The media thinks the monkeys of
the zoos calm in comparison to

ebe5659b-d242-4af4-975f-6eba5f323e3c-1
00:32:56.718 --> 00:32:58.390
the kids at this party.

3efaec16-0d4e-4ecd-a152-8001ffadd770-0
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.578
Hugo heads straight from the
party food to nibble  on

3efaec16-0d4e-4ecd-a152-8001ffadd770-1
00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:07.602
sandwiches, while annie
stretches and stretches his

3efaec16-0d4e-4ecd-a152-8001ffadd770-2
00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:12.554
wings and gets ready for game of
tug of war. There are Penguins

3efaec16-0d4e-4ecd-a152-8001ffadd770-3
00:33:12.554 --> 00:33:13.870
10 they can find.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:19.466
So we have it supposed to be
somebody's back garden was a

4e95361b-01f2-4af0-91f3-6b2544c3f8c3-1
00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:24.118
gated entrance to a fence all
the way around as a neighbour

4e95361b-01f2-4af0-91f3-6b2544c3f8c3-2
00:33:24.118 --> 00:33:28.615
old lady, peering over with
spectacles and a bum, peering

4e95361b-01f2-4af0-91f3-6b2544c3f8c3-3
00:33:28.615 --> 00:33:32.880
over the fence that's going on
the land and the trees.

d0ccc49b-611e-4aed-96a3-81918bebff18-0
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.470
People wearing masks.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.316
Old English policeman in his
blue uniform and pointy hat.

37d5acaf-678b-4984-a1c0-23b7cee0d11b-1
00:33:42.316 --> 00:33:45.593
He's in the middle of

37d5acaf-678b-4984-a1c0-23b7cee0d11b-2
00:33:45.593 --> 00:33:49.127
Vikings are attacking from
behind, so I suspect it's a

37d5acaf-678b-4984-a1c0-23b7cee0d11b-3
00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:52.532

people in costume. There's a

37d5acaf-678b-4984-a1c0-23b7cee0d11b-5

A knight in armor.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:15.005
I believe someone dressed an
elephant. He's walking past the

39e464ea-d1b9-4d0d-b35f-3a6e5c988e0a-1
00:34:15.005 --> 00:34:15.900

508dbd8a-cfb3-4ff6-984f-b6eee422f763-2
00:34:25.175 --> 00:34:26.930
behind the bouncy castle

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.760
And there's an old couple old
canvas Boy Scout tents that are.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.120
Look you bit shabby.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.690
Be looking at oops.

7d7aea48-991c-457a-a27d-3297913d5fc2-0
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.440
Gathered in small conversing.

867bddf6-1013-4178-93e6-bc4cd87954fd-0
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.131
People carrying walking, walking
staff, 6 foot walking staff.

867bddf6-1013-4178-93e6-bc4cd87954fd-1
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:14.649
They don't seem to be Spears,
but quite a lot of people have

867bddf6-1013-4178-93e6-bc4cd87954fd-2
00:42:14.649 --> 00:42:15.020
them.

8983ad70-3732-4405-b579-0bb74254f49a-0
00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:24.388
We had going to the caravans
that the ones seems to be on

8983ad70-3732-4405-b579-0bb74254f49a-1
00:42:24.388 --> 00:42:24.910
fire.

69764014-a8e3-416b-8460-f54d6d5f8088-0
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.430
On.

be7fbe16-a29f-4206-b994-3b0ddf6ad8aa-0
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.440
No, no vehicles have always been
parked in this field.

427de5e3-6ba3-4291-97ef-bc114ba78d47-0
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.760
The red walnut pink one and one
with the track.

919ecf95-3a00-434c-8377-0c6a12e61f13-0
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.500
Blue-green one.

4795f2d1-8d85-40a5-a0ff-c74c04823647-0
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.860
People just milling around them,
they know.

c5d7d01d-5805-4015-ab1d-a94f6ee50356-0
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.920
Actually sitting outside the.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.470
Proprietorially.

c0094a10-4cd8-45bc-a191-da5774ea4ef2-0
00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.010
But.

157a735a-e3fe-4665-afa5-4426f21145e2-0
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.990
With the owner of any farming,
the impossibles were behind.

2e196370-37e9-4cbc-b9f0-61d78cabf37a-0
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.094
in the distance there are gentle
hills with trees and throws

2e196370-37e9-4cbc-b9f0-61d78cabf37a-1
00:42:59.094 --> 00:43:03.841
quite small fields. No one sees
beer ball gazing 2 people in its

2e196370-37e9-4cbc-b9f0-61d78cabf37a-2
00:43:03.841 --> 00:43:04.280
field.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.780
We have.

6566e942-5807-4497-b0af-5bd155d04e24-0
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:19.083
We have a third. in the near
near the the ball and maybe

6566e942-5807-4497-b0af-5bd155d04e24-1
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:21.940
another donkey in the corner.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:26.549
I wouldn't then below has
another bull, but maybe they're

8286ae2c-ca4d-4982-80a6-1229f0db50cf-1
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:29.150
all bulls once that's grading as
donkey.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.150
We can see a couple of rabbits.

7f344676-2450-4e4f-96c1-e65e4e1f40e1-0
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:33.890
{Be ready.}

308b0be4-e78d-44aa-9612-d334f1489843-0
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:35.980
Of the fields.

d09d9c1f-8722-49cb-96c9-8ac1897753dc-0
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.710
I think some people, your people
feeding their kids perhaps.

0d7423ba-bda8-48e7-856c-bb26c8ffe652-0
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:49.936
 Someone is collapsing up his
tent or he's just a bad example,

0d7423ba-bda8-48e7-856c-bb26c8ffe652-1
00:43:49.936 --> 00:43:52.390
his tent right on the river
bank.

23b320cb-394b-42c3-9b44-37905045c8ea-0
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.460
There are sharks in the river.

202ebb34-66c5-45ac-924c-6f2ef4200bcd-0
00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.280
You see its
dorsals. #END_campsite 

79d8b7c3-a5b5-4d42-846c-c424da1d9b4d-0
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.570
No one else seems to know.

f742aa47-0267-4914-bd9d-899105a949b3-0
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.960
That's perfect.

28213e2f-3edb-49a8-9101-b62d6add06d7-0
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.110
And now I'll pull up.

d0a3d8f7-5d17-481a-a12f-b42dcd7e4e03-0
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:13.740
Our next one.

6487f212-62ce-4eb0-8d67-69ec5195881f-0
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.590
OK, so the next one, like I
said before, is going to be one

6487f212-62ce-4eb0-8d67-69ec5195881f-1
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:24.270
of the stories. So you you have
like 15 minutes to do the story

6487f212-62ce-4eb0-8d67-69ec5195881f-2
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.780
and let me know when you'd like
me to move on.

93287313-b534-4220-acd9-0e751cafa432-0
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:30.630
From each.

9a757010-9e24-4da9-bb1b-215694de714c-0
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.150
Uh, slide. And I'm going to
pull up.

eac930fd-1b5d-49e6-9fc9-30f061eb8b4c-0
00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:43.340
OK, I'm this. This story is 6
slides.

9bdc96ba-262d-40dd-a087-c1aefa55ee1d-0
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.460
Bless you.

21323163-14b3-4a40-a596-372f5041e074-0
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:58.061
You you're good. This story is
6 slides, so just let me know

21323163-14b3-4a40-a596-372f5041e074-1
00:44:58.061 --> 00:45:01.320
when you want me to move
forward.

b5191c21-adb9-4010-a88f-d2c8e472268c-0
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.410
OK.

f540533a-6f71-46d8-9058-ccdb33b9004c-0
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:05.800
OK.

b6279c4f-f07f-4e3f-aac8-e43567b8ee2b-0
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.510
#START_arrival_6 OK, so we have.

fbb14b18-f87f-41cd-b922-c3a92d344f34-0
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.850
A whole series
of small.

b3e8f656-0084-486e-a57b-36c14e4b1e8c-0
00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.160
Small little those little
pictures describing the scene.

74220dfc-293e-4078-bad4-630a12ddcd3b-0
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.260
And it is the man in a hat
wearing a

7b784beb-3c18-4141-a64d-f6a427d53f25-0
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.280
Suit

68e5ccef-0973-44f2-913c-6ef11b85d3f6-0
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:42.455
But didn't seem to be wearing
the tie anyway. So we we say we

68e5ccef-0973-44f2-913c-6ef11b85d3f6-1
00:45:42.455 --> 00:45:44.900
have like a table by the window.

a687855b-300a-4f5d-9b0c-eb96fd88e395-0
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.280
Empty pot.

d60ca4f5-6811-426d-a0dc-854cac3c39ab-0
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.320
And.

7afffbab-4bd1-4126-b04c-361c293df9f5-0
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:57.560
And it could be small origami
bird

68dac2a5-4aa3-4db6-8e13-520c68cad473-0
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.372
That the man is making and he's
written a letter on this small

68dac2a5-4aa3-4db6-8e13-520c68cad473-1
00:46:03.372 --> 00:46:08.322
piece of paper and he's then
turned into an origami bird and

68dac2a5-4aa3-4db6-8e13-520c68cad473-2
00:46:08.322 --> 00:46:13.110
put it into an envelope with
some cash money. He's sealing

68dac2a5-4aa3-4db6-8e13-520c68cad473-3
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.600
the envelope placing a postal
stamp on it.

0448ba70-9c5d-4b3b-bf8c-9b4dbe6b8600-0
00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.680
{There you go. That makes sense
now.}

804296ff-dc22-4a7e-9b79-263e1f6c06dd-0
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:26.490
Not sure what the flap is all
about, but he's now.

e449a32e-39dc-44f2-8728-829c9bf8590d-0
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.974
Written his letter, turned it
into a yellow folded origami

e449a32e-39dc-44f2-8728-829c9bf8590d-1
00:46:31.974 --> 00:46:37.013
bird. Places in the unrest that
stamped the envelope. sealed the

e449a32e-39dc-44f2-8728-829c9bf8590d-2
00:46:37.013 --> 00:46:40.890
envelope closed and he's walking
down the stairs.

bd587450-bcaa-4110-af85-92e1750afa7c-0
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.807
The peculiar creature is not as
he's seen him before, white with

bd587450-bcaa-4110-af85-92e1750afa7c-1
00:46:46.807 --> 00:46:49.550
a long tail, his bodies being
entirely.

db05e143-12b3-48ee-8375-d3599f7dd978-0
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.887
You can you can hinge mouth far
back in his body and I don't

db05e143-12b3-48ee-8375-d3599f7dd978-1
00:46:56.887 --> 00:47:01.495
know what it is. It seems to be
his pet he's going down a

db05e143-12b3-48ee-8375-d3599f7dd978-2
00:47:01.495 --> 00:47:06.342
staircase get an old woman with
a shopping basket and he's a

db05e143-12b3-48ee-8375-d3599f7dd978-3
00:47:06.342 --> 00:47:10.871
directions she's pointing just
behind him. So he and the

db05e143-12b3-48ee-8375-d3599f7dd978-4
00:47:10.871 --> 00:47:15.480
creature have walked off and
found a post box which seems

db05e143-12b3-48ee-8375-d3599f7dd978-5
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.499
quite complicated with buttons
on it.

83d85803-9aca-4676-b4f8-2f231c1158cf-0
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.937
He's reading the instructions
and turning a key in  into the

83d85803-9aca-4676-b4f8-2f231c1158cf-1
00:47:24.937 --> 00:47:26.360
slot. That's a bit.

455f5414-18e8-452f-9eea-cc8c80655520-0
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:32.322
He's looking for now. He's
posted his letter. He looks up

455f5414-18e8-452f-9eea-cc8c80655520-1
00:47:32.322 --> 00:47:35.800
and we see the next scene, which
is a.

671aa37f-266f-4c32-b482-233085a24930-0
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:42.430
Rural based with trees on it.
The trees.

65b4cdcf-5077-4603-83aa-e3ee70134548-0
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.575
More like just single leaves,
but they know they're standings

65b4cdcf-5077-4603-83aa-e3ee70134548-1
00:47:47.575 --> 00:47:50.410
to all these trees and floating
balloons.

507a16d9-d94c-4fd3-94fc-c4733919e4b3-0
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.180
Seems to be.

1d388228-c8ec-40c6-ad55-af89913dcca2-0
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.350
The mailbox seems to be hanging
below this floating door.

3e9e7003-c3c6-4993-b5c6-b6d3809a2ebf-0
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.786
And while the man walks all the
way down the hill with his

3e9e7003-c3c6-4993-b5c6-b6d3809a2ebf-1
00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:04.930
peculiar creature.

5d486c28-002f-46dc-8b3b-c68455abe3bf-0
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.510
Walking by his side had been
posted the envelope.

b80d270f-9d1f-4cd0-8b19-87ba2100fde9-0
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:10.900
{Next.}

54812404-db88-4175-9af7-4e17ac73af14-0
00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.716
OK, now we see in closer detail
what these trees are. Again,

54812404-db88-4175-9af7-4e17ac73af14-1
00:48:19.716 --> 00:48:24.352
they look like leaves, just
single leaves, but they're as

54812404-db88-4175-9af7-4e17ac73af14-2
00:48:24.352 --> 00:48:29.308
big as trees and we see them
developing. And of course of the

54812404-db88-4175-9af7-4e17ac73af14-3
00:48:29.308 --> 00:48:34.024
images, the first one is a leaf
planted in the ground, the

54812404-db88-4175-9af7-4e17ac73af14-4
00:48:34.024 --> 00:48:39.140
second one the splitting verdict
at the top, and it's it's it's

54812404-db88-4175-9af7-4e17ac73af14-5
00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.340
forming into 2.

6f7b7918-9305-421d-b2ba-ef98f1f31516-0
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:46.969
halves as it as it opens, the
several sprig appears and the

6f7b7918-9305-421d-b2ba-ef98f1f31516-1

00:49:05.427 --> 00:49:07.310

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:17.383
Blow away in the winter and back
and forth to the ground. The

00:49:17.383 --> 00:49:23.097
white filaments blew away and
form a snow scene, so we're left

discussing the dark and the the

00:49:36.466 --> 00:49:41.642
rest of his body is blown away
and perhaps formed the snow that

fee4cc22-ced4-4b0f-b9e9-15d6a734fe13-2
00:49:41.642 --> 00:49:45.120

 with roadways and chimneys and
smoke, and it all looks very

people around the ground.

00:50:37.275 --> 00:50:40.746
There's quite a huge building
and you see the people on the

I can't see man with the strange
creature, expect he'll appear

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.170

things and then in the first.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:18.642
Scene and then begin to grow and
it's almost as if the peculiar

69b68637-fca7-4776-b5dd-8f3790d2904a-1
00:52:18.642 --> 00:52:24.147
paper origami bird is got some
fledgling in this in this flap

on his feet. Meanwhile, the man.
Yeah, the man is sitting on the

69b68637-fca7-4776-b5dd-8f3790d2904a-3
00:52:29.918 --> 00:52:31.250

Poor picture of three people
maybe.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:45.776
And he's with me after that, we
that we have his desk and an oil

25159563-e4d6-4997-a867-460ddfff6c8b-1
00:52:45.776 --> 00:52:50.456
lamp, and the flat portion of
the strange creature feeding is

25159563-e4d6-4997-a867-460ddfff6c8b-2
00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:51.060

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:56.754
We come back the other strange
creature with a large long tail,

6a837f6d-a3a3-48c1-a6d3-e9f1ca85547f-1
00:52:56.754 --> 00:53:00.400
the white odd creature, then
maybe the end of the men's dog.

a87b5eb1-10d2-457e-9d90-584cbc20954e-0
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:05.587
He's as he's patiently he
suddenly appeared, disappeared

a87b5eb1-10d2-457e-9d90-584cbc20954e-1
00:53:05.587 --> 00:53:10.442
down a ladder. The man followed
near the ladder and found an

a87b5eb1-10d2-457e-9d90-584cbc20954e-2
00:53:10.442 --> 00:53:12.990
envelope with three stamps on it

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.641
Presumably, the man opens the
envelope looking inside. And

d62090f8-6dd8-4a3f-8933-8a2eb0ca28be-1
00:53:17.641 --> 00:53:21.874
there is that the origami bird
we saw being mailed a while ago.

d62090f8-6dd8-4a3f-8933-8a2eb0ca28be-2
00:53:21.874 --> 00:53:25.974
The man is obviously pleased
with this. He's finally gonna be

d62090f8-6dd8-4a3f-8933-8a2eb0ca28be-3
00:53:25.974 --> 00:53:30.141
reading message. He held it in
his hand and looked through the

d62090f8-6dd8-4a3f-8933-8a2eb0ca28be-4
00:53:30.141 --> 00:53:33.580

where it has come from.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:45.415
Ohh we see we have the origami
bird, but it actually looks more

31212cfc-534d-483f-973b-d016b78fe692-1
00:53:45.415 --> 00:53:50.841
like s scorpion or perhaps. It's
a it's a representation of the

31212cfc-534d-483f-973b-d016b78fe692-2
00:53:50.841 --> 00:53:53.300

Long tail and no back, like huge
mess that hinges half of its

00:54:01.478 --> 00:54:03.760

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:10.370
I'm gonna get a closer look at
the comical factory with a

The window in its side, which
has some sort of COG mechanism

00:54:16.877 --> 00:54:19.680
inside it, and we see a man's
land.

We have the newspaper with a cup
of tea.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:49.579
The man and his one child
unsuspectingly, the portrait

I think the man and depositing a
coin into or believe is the

giving her some money.

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:12.091
Well, we see a happy family
scene. There's a meal in the

801ec383-f772-4187-83b2-27f8426fb8b3-1
00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:16.522

doesn't look like a dining room.

801ec383-f772-4187-83b2-27f8426fb8b3-2
00:55:16.522 --> 00:55:18.400

The city is able to imagine that
we can see him.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:26.530

have a plate he has little tea.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:32.137
The mother has a plate I think
also, we can see it in front of

d84ed1c5-d4e9-4481-a937-515d762fc3c6-1
00:55:32.137 --> 00:55:36.249
the girl. Child has a plate and
the men's peculiar pet creature

00:55:36.249 --> 00:55:39.140
is sitting there. You feel the
little child.

31b91e58-1b4d-47e2-a730-9d4f98439fbd-0
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:46.440
So the child is putting on her
Wellington boots and patting the

31b91e58-1b4d-47e2-a730-9d4f98439fbd-1
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.720

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.503
And they're putting on her hat,
running down the staircase as

ead6a954-4c3c-412c-a6e3-54548f94a68c-1
00:55:53.503 --> 00:55:56.780
they are to leave their the,

00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.340

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.720

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.024
Malta, some of the of the

birds in the distance

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.580
This sky closing the sea

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:48.870
Is the man in the hat enough
fellow and the man has his pet

73f97687-d59e-480d-9d79-71eb0b50e892-1
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:54.877
cruder and the creature with an
even longer tail, and he has a

Ohh, he's he's kissing her on
the cheek.

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:18.570
quite happy about that.

off and they're all being
introduced and shaking hands

df3839f7-7e73-4123-abfe-606028fddbe9-3
00:59:33.405 --> 00:59:37.405
smiling, and she is now
gesturing him into the house.

df3839f7-7e73-4123-abfe-606028fddbe9-4
00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:39.480
Come this way, she's saying.

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:46.280
With the four hands and each
holding a glass of sort of like

think maybe they are all having

a glass of wine.

00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.050
Basket which has.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.548
Despite the leaking of the
evening meal or some very

44cd1868-df60-4bff-a262-e4b83afa9089-1
01:00:05.548 --> 01:00:10.751
strange creatures and like squid
and she's now chopping up in

44cd1868-df60-4bff-a262-e4b83afa9089-2
01:00:10.751 --> 01:00:15.787
preparation for the meal and
grinding them and putting them

44cd1868-df60-4bff-a262-e4b83afa9089-3
01:00:15.787 --> 01:00:17.970
into odd peaked pots with.

cce369a4-5bb6-40c1-bd0f-fa7208aecc90-0
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.319
With the pointy lid and some
holes to let the steam out like

cce369a4-5bb6-40c1-bd0f-fa7208aecc90-1
01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.890
she's made, it was like a
shaking.

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:32.010
About the gravy to it, like
getting married.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:33.990
having supper I think.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.252
And all indeed sitting there.
There are two creatures. The

15178695-17ed-49aa-a753-8e5c0e825fcb-1
01:00:43.252 --> 01:00:47.573
child is feeding one of them the
 one. We've known before the

15178695-17ed-49aa-a753-8e5c0e825fcb-2
01:00:47.573 --> 01:00:51.825
White one, there's a black one.
Pointy tails. Squirrel don't

15178695-17ed-49aa-a753-8e5c0e825fcb-3
01:00:51.825 --> 01:00:53.010
really know what.

ef4beec5-fcb9-4082-bf30-ef5b1687a812-0
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:57.160
They're all sitting in the
cloud.

01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:58.140
But.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.834
sitting at the dining table,
which has the clothing and the

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:07.610
dining room not the kitchen, and
it's laden with dishes.

e55c5455-236a-4434-a16c-c1d91d9c5de5-0
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.570
Or full of odd looking food
again.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.040
Like a still, you know,
deputizes squid. Maybe the fish

b77058a2-196b-4418-91df-73eb0869b613-1
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.060
in that too.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:26.101
And maybe in there is opening a
bottle and they're all we see

60b0b9c2-758a-4fb5-9c59-39e73a626deb-1
01:01:26.101 --> 01:01:29.890
images of them all eating and
laughing and joking and.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.380
trumpet horns coming out to make
it even louder. Woman is

blowing.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.180
Peculiar trumpet

a1bd8775-72f8-4cf6-a840-a3e080324b6f-0
01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:55.163
He's playing a banjo with the
the squirrel type creature

a1bd8775-72f8-4cf6-a840-a3e080324b6f-1
01:01:55.163 --> 01:01:56.210
joining in.

8fc576d8-e895-4900-b9c2-18117cda4dd7-0
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.314
And they're making the origami
creature by the second one that

8fc576d8-e895-4900-b9c2-18117cda4dd7-1
01:02:02.314 --> 01:02:06.270
that we gave her, the one that
looks like a squirrel.

c9106658-8c0e-4ecb-8257-fef6a2c9a625-0
01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.896
And the boy child is wearing his
father's hat he having been

c9106658-8c0e-4ecb-8257-fef6a2c9a625-1
01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:14.430
presented with his origami
creature.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:21.694
And every couple in the hat has
going to visit ohh on. He's

bfdf3f04-b90f-410e-9f6a-0610139a45b0-1
01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:26.318
removing a pot from the cabinet
and he and his wife are

bfdf3f04-b90f-410e-9f6a-0610139a45b0-2
01:02:26.318 --> 01:02:27.640
presenting this.

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:41.412
But we see the pot back where it
was in the first slide, sitting

c8f3c794-bb89-4473-8196-9b57f43d07d3-1
01:02:41.412 --> 01:02:44.390
on the dressing table by the
workshop.

f2564d22-fb7a-44bd-bde0-26be43768dba-0
