You might have to click OK if it
asks you to.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.110
OK.

7d7d331f-23b4-4551-936b-d49fbf2925df-0
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.795
As mentioned in the consent
process, you'll be seeing two

7d7d331f-23b4-4551-936b-d49fbf2925df-1
00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:26.063
types of pictures in this study.
The first type is graphic

7d7d331f-23b4-4551-936b-d49fbf2925df-2
00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:26.570
novels.

164eef3d-406e-461b-9644-32090f177784-0
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.079
They are series of pictures that
tells a story. Imagine you're

164eef3d-406e-461b-9644-32090f177784-1
00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.304
telling the story to someone who
cannot see the pictures.

164eef3d-406e-461b-9644-32090f177784-2
00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:43.821
Describe what you see and what
is happening as you go through

164eef3d-406e-461b-9644-32090f177784-3
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:44.550
the story.

761aed05-9244-44bd-a7cf-c810238143d7-0
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.060
Each story is around 30 pages.

b05acc23-42e0-4778-9c02-0ebd1a99e142-0
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.801
Please try to take around 10 to
15 minutes to tell the story and

b05acc23-42e0-4778-9c02-0ebd1a99e142-1
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:58.610
I will also keep track of the
time as we go through the story.

ef9430a5-1906-45ed-819e-dc8d3b35c88a-0
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.570
So the first story.

076b1f26-3e7a-4f91-b92e-1b95a74fe470-0
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:23.640


5813428e-cf91-447f-bb43-051833e51996-0
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.560
OK.

de5f403c-4651-414f-af57-c8da3f0cf523-0
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.180
I can't read the the story.

a9cf86e1-3381-4fc5-b7dc-f8cc53e101a4-0
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.540
That is OK. It will not. That is
just, um, won't matter at this.

a9cf86e1-3381-4fc5-b7dc-f8cc53e101a4-1
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.760
Yeah, it won't matter, OK.

4c29eeac-cd59-4e07-83c9-5df2abd23435-0
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.569
#START_journey So this there are
some children here are playing,

4c29eeac-cd59-4e07-83c9-5df2abd23435-1
00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.846
they look to be anywhere from 5
to 12 years old, and they're

4c29eeac-cd59-4e07-83c9-5df2abd23435-2
00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:26.140
playing outside an old building.

0bd36df5-0f36-4cd7-aa43-c1e5ae73df15-0
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.510
And in the city.

7e694c20-a3fd-4155-808c-74e2016e052b-0
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.465
There's a mailbox there and they
have one of them has a bicycle

7e694c20-a3fd-4155-808c-74e2016e052b-1
00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:43.027
and they seem to be very
friendly with each other and

7e694c20-a3fd-4155-808c-74e2016e052b-2
00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:48.433
they are playing near a corner
because there is a traffic light

7e694c20-a3fd-4155-808c-74e2016e052b-3
00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:48.939
there.

140f2e44-0112-42a7-9d3a-0063028e70ee-0
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.780
And there is a fire hydrant as
well and this is picture is

140f2e44-0112-42a7-9d3a-0063028e70ee-1
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.097
showing the sewer underneath the
street. So it's a cutaway of in

140f2e44-0112-42a7-9d3a-0063028e70ee-2
00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:09.950
the building. There's another
picture to the right.

2a108da8-e73b-4f65-a838-cd2d010a2699-0
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:18.331
That's showing a cut through of
a building, and there's a little

2a108da8-e73b-4f65-a838-cd2d010a2699-1
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:24.905
girl sitting on the steps,
looking somewhat despondent. She

2a108da8-e73b-4f65-a838-cd2d010a2699-2
00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:28.740
has a scooter, a red scooter,
and.

21274e35-e275-4c71-b203-8ac393de6c04-0
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.854
Inside the building it what is
probably her mother is preparing

21274e35-e275-4c71-b203-8ac393de6c04-1
00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:37.890
something on the stove.

f944538b-56ab-4a51-89d9-6fae66112bda-0
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.730
And there's a room in front of
her.

85bfac4b-2a5a-4694-9b90-e5e7e7369b7d-0
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.096
And a stairway. So you upstairs
there is a man at a desk with

85bfac4b-2a5a-4694-9b90-e5e7e7369b7d-1
00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:57.248
books. He must be in his office
or his study. And there's

85bfac4b-2a5a-4694-9b90-e5e7e7369b7d-2
00:03:57.248 --> 00:03:59.370
another little girl.

d0701d2f-c42c-4b32-ac14-8d574233541d-0
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.950
Uh, in another room upstairs.

8d6268e3-af5e-4026-aa72-da4c5cd12f8e-0
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.951
And downstairs we see the water
heater and what looks to be an

8d6268e3-af5e-4026-aa72-da4c5cd12f8e-1
00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:10.830
oil tank.

daa7e6e2-7f6f-4afd-b24e-87b44a060807-0
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.840
OK.

03fe5e60-5a72-42f4-ad09-b429fa68c643-0
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.290
Uh.

eb91799a-85de-46b7-9c70-9d33be206bed-0
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.360
OK.

3aeafc44-013f-4339-9d7d-fb5e8e853f6a-0
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.819
The mother is talking on the
phone while she's cooking at the

3aeafc44-013f-4339-9d7d-fb5e8e853f6a-1
00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.758
stove, and the little girl with
the scooter has brought the

3aeafc44-013f-4339-9d7d-fb5e8e853f6a-2
00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:36.827
scooter inside the house and is
there probably trying to help

3aeafc44-013f-4339-9d7d-fb5e8e853f6a-3
00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:37.550
her mother.

799becb8-2d1d-40bc-9d11-ec445c82086f-0
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.630
Now she has.

95d0cd04-3df6-42b1-93fb-ea4748be62f2-0
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.184
Uh is taking with her has gone
to see the man who is looking at

95d0cd04-3df6-42b1-93fb-ea4748be62f2-1
00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:56.210
a computer. What looks to be a
computer.

a78cc479-eda6-4d1b-a43a-fa92b8d241a8-0
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.140
And she has with her.

4622e0e2-ee93-4287-bcfa-059ea1608b3c-0
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.326
Something that looks like a
kite, that's a red kite I would

4622e0e2-ee93-4287-bcfa-059ea1608b3c-1
00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:09.272
say, and she is trying to talk
to him. He doesn't seem very

4622e0e2-ee93-4287-bcfa-059ea1608b3c-2
00:05:09.272 --> 00:05:11.180
interested in talking to her.

10d9c08f-b386-4e89-9076-e6c94c88d77f-0
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.848
Then she approaches another
sister. What it looks to be a

10d9c08f-b386-4e89-9076-e6c94c88d77f-1
00:05:17.848 --> 00:05:20.150
sister who was trying to.

8ab0de5e-801b-4a0a-b72e-7d1c58e3db31-0
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.265
Read on the couch and she has
the kite with her and is trying

8ab0de5e-801b-4a0a-b72e-7d1c58e3db31-1
00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:29.000
to show it to her.

7572a4bb-af47-4bfd-a7ea-469e4a54880f-0
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.494
And then we shall see a picture
of another little girl in her

7572a4bb-af47-4bfd-a7ea-469e4a54880f-1
00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:41.270
bed in her which is probably her
bedroom.

28b0e612-d7b0-4398-860e-582676bc4cdd-0
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.155
Maybe this is the same little
girl with the kite. The kite is

28b0e612-d7b0-4398-860e-582676bc4cdd-1
00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:51.258
no longer in evidence, but she
is there. She's wearing the same

28b0e612-d7b0-4398-860e-582676bc4cdd-2
00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:55.169
clothes, looks like a T shirt
and shorts, and there is a cat

28b0e612-d7b0-4398-860e-582676bc4cdd-3
00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.669
also in the room, curled up,
sleeping.

a4c9520a-7ef8-4071-954f-ca3494b25b69-0
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.807
And now here the little girl has
the cat is leaving and there is

a4c9520a-7ef8-4071-954f-ca3494b25b69-1
00:06:11.807 --> 00:06:12.910
a red item.

1d45192e-de9d-4a01-98bf-3f4a95e5df32-0
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.914
That maybe belongs to the little
girl who the cat had that under

1d45192e-de9d-4a01-98bf-3f4a95e5df32-1
00:06:18.914 --> 00:06:24.000
him, so he probably grabbed it
from her and was sleeping on it.

1cb3093d-e75f-4f72-87e3-c17e3ca375b8-0
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.195
She has a map on her wall and
you can see some of the

1cb3093d-e75f-4f72-87e3-c17e3ca375b8-1
00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:37.978
buildings outside her room. She
has a chest of drawers there and

1cb3093d-e75f-4f72-87e3-c17e3ca375b8-2
00:06:37.978 --> 00:06:41.840
it's a high ceiling room. Small
but.

747ff042-2712-4600-bc8f-910cc4c1e695-0
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.260
Uh.

ae681bbe-7fc8-41ca-8432-18995f9f29fc-0
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.810
It appears to be a room that
she.

8fda2493-4869-406a-a677-b9997f470a5c-0
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.030
She has for herself.

9269062b-6de2-4f05-994e-d82cc8498568-0
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.368
Then in the next one she is
taking this red object. I can't

9269062b-6de2-4f05-994e-d82cc8498568-1
00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:04.905
tell exactly what it may be as
some kind of a pen because she

9269062b-6de2-4f05-994e-d82cc8498568-2
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:08.119
is drawing on the wall with it
and.

5557bdf8-3800-4f43-9cd8-c9621743028b-0
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.631
There are papers there, but she
isn't drawing on those. She's

5557bdf8-3800-4f43-9cd8-c9621743028b-1
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:16.370
drawing on the wall with this
red object.

72b661a8-9a99-474f-b50a-6199f9f38a61-0
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.635
And then she's making a door in
the wall and when she has made

72b661a8-9a99-474f-b50a-6199f9f38a61-1
00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:29.102
that door, it's an archway and
she is able to open it and go

72b661a8-9a99-474f-b50a-6199f9f38a61-2
00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:34.300
into the next room. Amazing. And
the door has become red.

dc69015a-ad9c-42d3-9ab3-3c769055ae75-0
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.725
And in the next room, everything
has been rather colorless, kind

dc69015a-ad9c-42d3-9ab3-3c769055ae75-1
00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:47.945
of a sepia color until now, with
the exception of the scooter and

dc69015a-ad9c-42d3-9ab3-3c769055ae75-2
00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:49.830
this red pencil pen.

72a4dc08-510a-486d-9bb7-274b9031eea7-0
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.731
And now we see some green in the
adjoining room where she is has

72a4dc08-510a-486d-9bb7-274b9031eea7-1
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:58.400
gone through the wall.

8d86d987-820b-4b42-a19c-da2c001350fa-0
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.481
Oh, now we see that she has
connected with she's gone

8d86d987-820b-4b42-a19c-da2c001350fa-1
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:13.160
through a wall, making her own
door, and she is now in a woods.

f1327900-2600-491b-9990-a86c76aedf32-0
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:20.259
Lots and lots of trees, and
there are many balloons hanging

f1327900-2600-491b-9990-a86c76aedf32-1
00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:25.962
from wires throughout these
woods and there's a road, rather

f1327900-2600-491b-9990-a86c76aedf32-2
00:08:25.962 --> 00:08:28.300
a river going through it.

90ea4de6-76ee-4ee2-8bab-6338a2c37e0e-0
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.400
Through the woods.

d83970d8-f1b2-4f23-8cd4-7bb2c5986d99-0
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.190
And.

03321dd4-eac0-435d-8d3c-da17f242508e-0
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.850
She goes down the river.

7db16f74-543a-43f0-9496-21ef8daaf442-0
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.290
And is carrying her red as is
must be a magic pen.

6bf83fb1-9cff-4719-80b8-2cb5b81d593c-0
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.190
And there is also.

e7154012-53c8-46fb-9705-87247357b6b6-0
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.140
Something in the river that has
a similar pen.

bbdfaa46-65d0-4db8-85d9-d38eadbbd13e-0
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.196
Uh and there are lights hanging
to light her way. She is

bbdfaa46-65d0-4db8-85d9-d38eadbbd13e-1
00:08:59.196 --> 00:09:05.271
standing on a projection of kind
of a dock that projects out into

bbdfaa46-65d0-4db8-85d9-d38eadbbd13e-2
00:09:05.271 --> 00:09:09.230
the river and looking down into
the river.

9121af46-9e52-4925-ae08-912a1d720d29-0
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.370
And she.

7a71f257-cedf-499f-825a-0889bc54e659-0
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:19.588
Goes to the end of the dock with
her magic pen and starts to

7a71f257-cedf-499f-825a-0889bc54e659-1
00:09:19.588 --> 00:09:22.790
draw. She draws a little skiff.

7cde11d1-5736-48f7-b0df-005b77fdb63f-0
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.271
And gets into the skiff. The
skiff turns red, the dock is

7cde11d1-5736-48f7-b0df-005b77fdb63f-1
00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:34.895
green, and she gets into the
skiff and goes floating down the

7cde11d1-5736-48f7-b0df-005b77fdb63f-2
00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:35.440
river.

21bf2e59-cfa0-42e5-8cbf-082beac9e44b-0
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.970
Amazing, yeah.

e0dc29ac-56c0-49b3-8f87-b6470caa14f5-0
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.944
Now here she comes in her skiff
through the river and she is

e0dc29ac-56c0-49b3-8f87-b6470caa14f5-1
00:09:45.944 --> 00:09:48.390
approaching this huge castle.

8f37acf8-0776-4b0f-afc2-bf456f34d7d0-0
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.578
With a lot of minarets and
turrets and there's a Moat

8f37acf8-0776-4b0f-afc2-bf456f34d7d0-1
00:09:54.578 --> 00:09:56.190
around this castle.

609a1f9b-48cd-4bfb-b28e-3e31831bd2f5-0
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.595
Apparently she is on her way to
the entrance. She is between the

609a1f9b-48cd-4bfb-b28e-3e31831bd2f5-1
00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:06.974
walls of the entrance and it
appears that she is able to get

609a1f9b-48cd-4bfb-b28e-3e31831bd2f5-2
00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:07.620
in there.

3ebb02e9-9f95-4944-a69a-36c997538a30-0
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.260
In her magic boat.

822cc196-95d3-498f-94c0-7cf211a40741-0
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.810
Uh.

ddee1f00-a0ed-4415-8a99-43342e424a97-0
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.400
Now then, she has gone over a.

927c6b4d-27cf-4d22-b199-5f2fdeddcad9-0
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.080
Now I'm blanking out what you
call them the.

d25a6ec3-46d7-4b7f-aa22-f146d7a09538-0
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:37.124
Locks when you have different
levels of water in the uh in a

d25a6ec3-46d7-4b7f-aa22-f146d7a09538-1
00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:39.660
lake or a body of water.

4a767fb7-aa40-4ba9-af30-49e78d9f0a6a-0
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:46.515
And she has gotten through one
of those and is being greeted by

4a767fb7-aa40-4ba9-af30-49e78d9f0a6a-1
00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:48.580
what looks like a guard.

66a12d9e-937c-4735-943e-ff2c3c7a5c27-0
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.470
Waving to her and there are
other guards or people in

66a12d9e-937c-4735-943e-ff2c3c7a5c27-1
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:59.267
uniform, I should say. What what
they may be. They must be

66a12d9e-937c-4735-943e-ff2c3c7a5c27-2
00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:01.300
guardians of this castle.

63eb28d4-96fb-425e-bdc1-b564f9b7657b-0
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.260
And they're saluting one of them
is saluting her.

3cbb9074-df2b-42ca-9572-77a1eccec5d7-0
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:12.568
Others are waving to her, so she
is apparently known to them and

3cbb9074-df2b-42ca-9572-77a1eccec5d7-1
00:11:12.568 --> 00:11:14.840
maybe owns this castle.

7b3b9c47-e2af-4dd1-bc6b-73c5c7350f2c-0
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.933
Anyway, has a proprietary
interest in it, shall we say.

7b3b9c47-e2af-4dd1-bc6b-73c5c7350f2c-1
00:11:21.933 --> 00:11:28.048
There are other people on barges
there, gondolas maybe, that

7b3b9c47-e2af-4dd1-bc6b-73c5c7350f2c-2
00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:33.863
they're pulling along that look
as if they may be working

7b3b9c47-e2af-4dd1-bc6b-73c5c7350f2c-3
00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:36.570
somehow within this castle.

4af0f006-7549-4145-a099-58c26506e4ac-0
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.480
There's a waterfall coming from
one area that's replenishing the

4af0f006-7549-4145-a099-58c26506e4ac-1
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.940
water down below.

b949c059-a3bd-46b1-9bc0-5f743fc4c581-0
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:53.131
And there are several passages,
water waterways where she could

b949c059-a3bd-46b1-9bc0-5f743fc4c581-1
00:11:53.131 --> 00:11:59.313
go, so we're going to see what
happens to her. There are gold

b949c059-a3bd-46b1-9bc0-5f743fc4c581-2
00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:03.799
colored turrets on the top of
some of these.

ae72707c-5a05-4373-ba42-b6e4458dc391-0
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.550
Edifices.

75f89038-ee05-4747-83f2-7e6c1f559e20-0
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.290
Uh.

53d21e1f-d02c-4f82-8fac-3b5713714254-0
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.172
OK, whoops. She has come to the
end of one of these and there's

53d21e1f-d02c-4f82-8fac-3b5713714254-1
00:12:16.172 --> 00:12:19.540
a giant waterfall that she is
going to be.

9df746f6-f89f-4b76-be0c-1b09433aca89-0
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:26.810
Cascading down with that
waterfall into what looks like.

eae38243-a876-4a7c-b139-aa67c997ddbf-0
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.230
Uh, there's some, really.

5c71f813-a02f-4915-bdd0-562ee2459f63-0
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.010
Foaming water.

ab69e943-e4a4-4b71-9e43-dfa1dc8b0195-0
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.183
Looks like it might be very
dangerous, but again she takes

ab69e943-e4a4-4b71-9e43-dfa1dc8b0195-1
00:12:41.183 --> 00:12:42.530
out her magic pen.

5b45cadd-60cb-42e3-bcfd-37b1777fe9aa-0
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:49.493
And leaves the boat. The boat
falls down, but she is up here

5b45cadd-60cb-42e3-bcfd-37b1777fe9aa-1
00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:55.477
above it, marking out a what
appears to be a circle that she

5b45cadd-60cb-42e3-bcfd-37b1777fe9aa-2
00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:57.930
will probably be able to.

ba395d42-ab2e-4adf-890a-9f4541196472-0
00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.710
Go through.

5f6c19b0-7875-4c46-90ff-ff3eb5767d36-0
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.380
Ah, she's made herself a
balloon. That's a.

4b1bc618-765c-4ce9-b85f-fde713aab230-0
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:16.951
That she can be in a hot air
balloon and she's now up in the

4b1bc618-765c-4ce9-b85f-fde713aab230-1
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:22.200
sky and she's floating by a tall
tower with a.

cf55774f-6ec0-4040-8c85-c4e759279740-0
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.260
Ah, they are

2985235b-6d24-472f-9109-2e8a3701c565-0
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.470
It's a. It's a boat with an
arrow and it's a.

e93e186a-2d3e-43c4-886b-3d707d24cebb-0
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:37.900
Ha ha.

3f90f77c-cc18-4a01-bf24-439d66eccb4e-0
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.490
Blank out the word for it.
Anyway.

5ad294d2-ca5b-48c1-a6d0-7c7c36e60373-0
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.810
Ah.

c4511969-b17d-466b-88ad-ec1f64cc134b-0
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.480
Need to think. It will come to
me. In any event, they are

c4511969-b17d-466b-88ad-ec1f64cc134b-1
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.445
waving to her, so she's they're
not uh that's not an expected.

c4511969-b17d-466b-88ad-ec1f64cc134b-2
00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:05.780
This apparently is something
that she does frequently.

78d397b9-26e8-4021-a691-d2b29e3df8db-0
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.760
Um.

35fae428-41d5-456e-b18c-8cd6c72ab549-0
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.430
Ohh.

69415986-1e7a-4ee3-8e7d-65214db4fdb0-0
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.709
What I'm trying to think of is
it designates the direction of

69415986-1e7a-4ee3-8e7d-65214db4fdb0-1
00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:18.360
the wind.

160399c0-8a1c-4067-83b1-aa9c1d0390fb-0
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:27.943
Uh, anyway, uh, then we see over
in the right hand a lot of

160399c0-8a1c-4067-83b1-aa9c1d0390fb-1
00:14:27.943 --> 00:14:36.492
cumulus clouds, and she is now
on a what looks to be a paddle

160399c0-8a1c-4067-83b1-aa9c1d0390fb-2
00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:37.320
wheel.

6019e623-378c-434f-99e1-af2787962618-0
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:44.475
uh boat, but it's a plane
instead. There are a number of

6019e623-378c-434f-99e1-af2787962618-1
00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:50.826
objects in the sky here, and she
is standing on one of them. It

6019e623-378c-434f-99e1-af2787962618-2
00:14:50.826 --> 00:14:57.077
appears to be an old-fashioned
boiler of some kind with an old

6019e623-378c-434f-99e1-af2787962618-3
00:14:57.077 --> 00:15:01.940
fashioned paddle wheel. But it's
there's a bird.

12c5b16d-d01b-4997-8bb9-f5cb018ecd03-0
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:09.793
Looks to be a bird that is a
pink. It's not red, but it's

12c5b16d-d01b-4997-8bb9-f5cb018ecd03-1
00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:15.923
pink. So it's another form of
life I would say that we haven't

12c5b16d-d01b-4997-8bb9-f5cb018ecd03-2
00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:16.410
seen.

d780ce02-4d9f-4df6-9d3c-bdd6cf8da636-0
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.140
Yeah or before.

b385e848-5d90-4ca8-9aef-9189250a9f9d-0
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.467
OK, so she's back in her balloon
and she sees that thing go by.

b385e848-5d90-4ca8-9aef-9189250a9f9d-1
00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:29.900
It looks kind of like a
dirigible.

bc1a7a24-a025-4525-af22-d568d1daaa83-0
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.320
Uh.

764ee1f8-a5d2-493d-b985-f7cc011cc87d-0
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.770
And there are some people on it.

f7ac9bec-f54c-4f48-ad37-9e0a9ac8179b-0
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:44.122
Uh, trying to catch this bird,
this pink bird. Apparently

f7ac9bec-f54c-4f48-ad37-9e0a9ac8179b-1
00:15:44.122 --> 00:15:46.800
that's something valuable.

a22c937a-2ece-406b-9724-af54ee81a399-0
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.100
And they have a cage for it on
their

cdd1a0fa-9ae9-45a9-8f54-5cdf240affac-0
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:05.380
Vehicle. And again we have the
other piece that has a propeller

cdd1a0fa-9ae9-45a9-8f54-5cdf240affac-1
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:12.093
and it has a paddle wheel and it
has an old-fashioned looks like

cdd1a0fa-9ae9-45a9-8f54-5cdf240affac-2
00:16:12.093 --> 00:16:18.393
a plane. And again a number of
ways of going, moving through

cdd1a0fa-9ae9-45a9-8f54-5cdf240affac-3
00:16:18.393 --> 00:16:19.219
the air.

7ac5986d-83ef-4c70-9b7e-3450e5edf7db-0
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.120
And here it is again. This is
that a lot of moving parts.

62db7aa8-af72-4e4b-8ef8-25b95368fc59-0
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.210
And the.

9472f542-3803-4584-b80d-3ab2dbb27480-0
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.474
The dirigible is there with the
people who are trying to catch

9472f542-3803-4584-b80d-3ab2dbb27480-1
00:16:36.474 --> 00:16:40.662
the bird, or over in the one
area there is a what looks like

9472f542-3803-4584-b80d-3ab2dbb27480-2
00:16:40.662 --> 00:16:41.279
an eagle.

579fc831-5947-4cbc-87ee-9f7de6e63209-0
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.510
Or a some kind of a.

724bb4a2-4fc7-4158-968d-86cb2c3d7917-0
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.200
A bird of prey a.

b214007e-b551-4a26-90c1-a77f2b728c8a-0
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:57.052
In gold, on the top of this
boat, who appears to be steering

b214007e-b551-4a26-90c1-a77f2b728c8a-1
00:16:57.052 --> 00:17:02.851
it, and then on the back of it,
she is coming toward a woman and

b214007e-b551-4a26-90c1-a77f2b728c8a-2
00:17:02.851 --> 00:17:08.293
a child, two children and a
woman, and up on the top of this

b214007e-b551-4a26-90c1-a77f2b728c8a-3
00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:14.181
machine, this oiled machine. And
there's another dirigible in the

b214007e-b551-4a26-90c1-a77f2b728c8a-4
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:16.680
background. So they must be.

d96a8fae-2bef-47e8-837e-4553dbb67e94-0
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.582
One form of transportation that
are relatively common. And then

d96a8fae-2bef-47e8-837e-4553dbb67e94-1
00:17:26.582 --> 00:17:31.781
there's this large one that, as
I say, has a number of ways of

d96a8fae-2bef-47e8-837e-4553dbb67e94-2
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:33.020
getting around.

94ec1f20-cb4e-4401-97b2-907b88803630-0
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.580
Now she has landed on that
large.

75764a05-f38f-4aba-a235-d57e9cacdafd-0
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.470
Vehicle.

5531494c-134b-4f61-a861-3df646adff14-0
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.090
And is running down a

601d2ee6-62d8-426c-9314-d4667a380432-0
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.180
Bridge.

b1a7a4bd-13ec-431b-b375-df0df9b18301-0
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.560
And there are some people up on
another bridge who appear to be.

acb2d585-08b3-4b61-928b-cfe684c49aab-0
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.690
Dancing.

659ec43c-8571-462a-a756-142bd3fdaf77-0
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.350
And there is a closer up of the
winged bird.

994435b7-3946-40d1-ae24-f90ed432a6ae-0
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.903
And some people underneath
there, they appear to be guards.

994435b7-3946-40d1-ae24-f90ed432a6ae-1
00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:16.797
Ah, they've got that pink bird
in the cage and it's being

994435b7-3946-40d1-ae24-f90ed432a6ae-2
00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:21.776
guarded by some soldiers who
appear to be kind of Egyptian

994435b7-3946-40d1-ae24-f90ed432a6ae-3
00:18:21.776 --> 00:18:24.730
type soldiers. But the top on
the.

07e86dd0-6aff-4608-af0b-bc3fec6ea4e4-0
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:32.052
Where they are keeping the bird
looks more Chinese, and now in

07e86dd0-6aff-4608-af0b-bc3fec6ea4e4-1
00:18:32.052 --> 00:18:37.710
this one she is climbing a
ladder with her magic marker.

993edd2c-a063-41cd-8843-89542869df93-0
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:44.380
Uh, coming toward the bird. Ah,
she's grabbed the bird.

e997d584-6bd3-4c89-bcd5-477b51967f84-0
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.447
And the soldiers weren't
looking, and she managed to 

e997d584-6bd3-4c89-bcd5-477b51967f84-1
00:18:50.447 --> 00:18:53.450
snatch the bird away in its
cage.

bc00a158-678a-48e7-a012-fcfe2a339b28-0
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.720
And now,

f02d9800-679e-4746-a45f-9bf2e65fb945-0
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.120
We see another cutaway of this
ship. Yes, it looks this is the

f02d9800-679e-4746-a45f-9bf2e65fb945-1
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.491
ship part of it and what they
are doing, the people who are

f02d9800-679e-4746-a45f-9bf2e65fb945-2
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:12.610
running the thing with all of
its mechanisms.

8b51e8e5-cab0-48d3-a0fb-37e6d4a2902e-0
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.820
Inside and they are running
after her and she.

392147a2-6f92-4bba-9e84-3226f3c5b963-0
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:25.049
Is letting the bird go free, has
taken it out of its cage and is

392147a2-6f92-4bba-9e84-3226f3c5b963-1
00:19:25.049 --> 00:19:30.531
letting it go free but her magic
marker is left on the deck here.

392147a2-6f92-4bba-9e84-3226f3c5b963-2
00:19:30.531 --> 00:19:35.100
They're coming toward it, and
she has let the bird go.

cfdaad32-f7d4-4cd9-825e-b2d0f49b132b-0
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:45.072
And they've grabbed her and her
magic marker has fallen off. So

cfdaad32-f7d4-4cd9-825e-b2d0f49b132b-1
00:19:45.072 --> 00:19:48.450
she is not, does not have that
with her.

de76b015-24d6-4393-b8f4-68634f7ebd44-0
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:54.734
And the guards seem to be
annoyed that they're they're

de76b015-24d6-4393-b8f4-68634f7ebd44-1
00:19:54.734 --> 00:20:00.878
going to punish her because the
bird has escaped the cage that

de76b015-24d6-4393-b8f4-68634f7ebd44-2
00:20:00.878 --> 00:20:07.218
they had it in. So now they have
taken her and put her in a cage

de76b015-24d6-4393-b8f4-68634f7ebd44-3
00:20:07.218 --> 00:20:12.679
and they're dropping her from
one of the parts of this.

09a627a4-9ab0-4201-949a-5a080582703b-0
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.880
Vehicle.

c8fa8b21-c2f5-4f5a-8ca4-3a6c2493f2a1-0
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.431
From behind with the where the
propeller is. And here comes the

c8fa8b21-c2f5-4f5a-8ca4-3a6c2493f2a1-1
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.970
bird toward her. She's in this
cage.

0a430c6f-6a9c-4095-a50f-f02feec60df2-0
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.940
But the bird is coming with her
magic marker.

12c1c838-c868-46bd-bd7c-6094eb61caa1-0
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.660
Amazing.

5de8cc3b-85ad-4b9f-8401-43f66bbf71b1-0
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.949
And now she has the marker, the
bird is on her shoulder and she

5de8cc3b-85ad-4b9f-8401-43f66bbf71b1-1
00:20:39.949 --> 00:20:41.690
is making another.

29e81a99-9d74-493b-bf24-b8f89508ecda-0
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.180
Space where

aa4db759-579b-41b2-a0f3-9aca2d4c365e-0
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.040
Magic will happen again.

9e11a985-9fd9-49c0-8fb0-403b8e7cfcb1-0
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:57.614
And here she is on a red carpet,
a flying carpet. The bird is

9e11a985-9fd9-49c0-8fb0-403b8e7cfcb1-1
00:20:57.614 --> 00:21:04.184
leading her and she is. She has
escaped from this cage and it's

9e11a985-9fd9-49c0-8fb0-403b8e7cfcb1-2
00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:06.340
looking down on this.

c52d1e97-d5b1-45f5-90e6-672869f1bb11-0
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:13.595
Vehicle tram transport thing. It
looks like the whole city is on

c52d1e97-d5b1-45f5-90e6-672869f1bb11-1
00:21:13.595 --> 00:21:19.670
it and people are living there,
but she has gotten away from it.

c33f6656-5f41-4b65-ac7a-ad4a4df6bb03-0
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.850
And is.

450a735b-2ea4-4390-b627-2f8dc9e2abb0-0
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.310
Is uh.

e7b946ca-9f70-424a-85a2-448b78887e24-0
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.770
Has escaped with her bird.

548ee72a-3500-4a7a-ac18-7bec651aa0b9-0
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:40.988
Now it's nightfall and she is on
her flying carpet in the sky

548ee72a-3500-4a7a-ac18-7bec651aa0b9-1
00:21:40.988 --> 00:21:43.910
with a lot of stars out there.

ca9ea427-0021-414a-96ea-4c9aed345eb4-0
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.110
You can see some mountains in
the distance.

997509eb-58ae-44c5-97ea-e23029c0e268-0
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.687
And there is the bird ahead of
her. She's following the bird to

997509eb-58ae-44c5-97ea-e23029c0e268-1
00:21:54.687 --> 00:21:57.070
well, it looks like a tropical.

a4c9803b-2700-486a-a120-d8e54c9d4520-0
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:04.052
Area. There's a palm tree of
some kind and it looks very

a4c9803b-2700-486a-a120-d8e54c9d4520-1
00:22:04.052 --> 00:22:10.760
serene, and there's water below,
but nothing that appears to be.

58c60b91-c311-41e6-9edb-1c13eceada0e-0
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.360
Dangerous.

dcc055e7-36d5-4dd3-b497-3f7614c7562b-0
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.133
And she is back on land again
with her bird, and the bird has

dcc055e7-36d5-4dd3-b497-3f7614c7562b-1
00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:22.300
a.

cd4f95f9-dcb2-4adb-b790-15166d97b383-0
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:31.931
House has a lodging. It's a its
own door is colored the same as

cd4f95f9-dcb2-4adb-b790-15166d97b383-1
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:33.280
in the bird.

92257bbf-874b-4ee2-bd8c-161f76c98836-0
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.883
In in in what appears to be a
tree, and she is leaving her

92257bbf-874b-4ee2-bd8c-161f76c98836-1
00:22:39.883 --> 00:22:43.730
magic carpet and approaching
that door.

ef588879-8942-437c-a357-33ef6f2477f8-0
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.570
She comes to open the door, and
the bird is.

ed1b726f-541d-41ed-9ca8-c4464d1648c8-0
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.230
Welcoming her, and the bird
flies into its tree.

3280ff95-8620-46ba-841e-b474220ca269-0
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.470
And she takes her marker and
follows the bird into the tree.

556d95ac-f4d2-4b35-8a6d-a1060ce36480-0
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.380
Now we're back to the original
city scape.

da81e02c-77e9-4f2b-9815-f9fe83064441-0
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:19.231
Where the kids are running and
there's a little boy who is has

da81e02c-77e9-4f2b-9815-f9fe83064441-1
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:25.245
a magic marker the same color as
this bird, which is the pink

da81e02c-77e9-4f2b-9815-f9fe83064441-2
00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:25.730
bird.

52d313b0-90b4-443e-bc02-5412593b47fa-0
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.355
And the little girl is coming
out of the mailbox with her

52d313b0-90b4-443e-bc02-5412593b47fa-1
00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:33.650
magic marker.

fefc0bf9-9ac9-4404-a045-beb13476255a-0
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:47.602
Now we see the girl and the boy
and the bird is there with them

fefc0bf9-9ac9-4404-a045-beb13476255a-1
00:23:47.602 --> 00:23:53.670
and she is making a mark with
her marker, some circles. And

fefc0bf9-9ac9-4404-a045-beb13476255a-2
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:59.738
the little boy is making his
circle so they are playing the

fefc0bf9-9ac9-4404-a045-beb13476255a-3
00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:00.749
game that.

8d2bb8ec-58bd-4c61-bc06-0d73c613f29e-0
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.730
They have.

29432b6c-5ea0-4bda-bf27-9eb670b50404-0
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.850
Made up and had this adventure.

7255d8e0-5772-4ada-9a2b-a188babc1c01-0
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.250
And all has ended well.

c26704d2-4fa9-4348-ad0f-2d4c7e07b21e-0
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:17.803
And here they are on their
bicycle with the red and the

c26704d2-4fa9-4348-ad0f-2d4c7e07b21e-1
00:24:17.803 --> 00:24:19.680
purple, pinK purple.

0e73a14a-af85-4635-9427-7aaca3b76f0c-0
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.960
Markers. So they have.

937c3831-cae5-42d3-9e8e-c69aac3c3017-0
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.830
This is Alice in Wonderland.

f4bdefdf-6bc1-45c2-9f5b-c7bf23425282-0
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.140
OK, so that was the story.

8ba4b9b7-7f98-471c-88a8-5c936850720a-0
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.390
So the next item is also a
graphic novel.

Again, please describe what you
see and what is happening as we

c8a09410-3f5f-4a8c-a0fd-606d23145298-1
00:24:49.864 --> 00:24:51.300
go through the story.

d22e8143-b088-4b9b-8999-6c48836d66da-0
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:02.421
#START_arrival_2 Hey, this is in
again uh sepia and black and

d22e8143-b088-4b9b-8999-6c48836d66da-1
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:02.930
white.

3e52bde5-4973-431d-aa8e-909c6f02d237-0
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.740
Somewhat monochrome.

fe81dacc-70e9-4b9d-afab-e70243504845-0
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.210
And we see.

b9bbbb23-17fb-4266-b6ec-57edeba4e917-0
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.350
what appear to be uh, people

ad609462-490f-4c6b-b5d9-78ce0ff6a51b-0
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.750
Immigrating.

40711508-58ac-4996-b37a-1dad777adc3e-0
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.020
They're traveling in any case.

659b1b7f-ae86-49c1-b9e3-005a0d809fbd-0
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:32.360
And writing. One of them is
writing in a book.

8b874b42-145d-4d50-be93-49413eb77cbc-0
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:41.570
And has made a a paper airplane
out of one of the pages.

77a4ca16-4ee6-427e-9c77-fe5e904fdae9-0
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.190
Uh, what he's written on it and.

7c016e97-420e-41b2-80d6-8bc9dfb76d17-0
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.200
Uh.

e6a75ca0-a8da-4065-80aa-ad5a48b7553e-0
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.520
Is.

9e617f58-49a3-45a8-9afc-41da95deacbe-0
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.990
It appears he's dropped it,
where maybe somebody can find

9e617f58-49a3-45a8-9afc-41da95deacbe-1
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.200
it.

18f5afa0-93f1-43c5-9ddf-14f11b2cc232-0
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:06.256
Yeah, it has turned into, uh,
he's looking into the sky and he

18f5afa0-93f1-43c5-9ddf-14f11b2cc232-1
00:26:06.256 --> 00:26:10.900
sees many, many of these, what
could be that paper,

66ca200f-01d1-443e-8e59-ad14e59d85bc-0
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.470
Transformed into flying
creatures that are going to be

66ca200f-01d1-443e-8e59-ad14e59d85bc-1
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:23.700
dispersed everywhere. And these
people, it seems, are on a ship.

0c18432e-153d-44b9-9814-7ba5fedf0e75-0
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:25.690
Uh.

85e9e2bd-e668-4700-b923-20a8e5f6a559-0
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:34.620
Looking up and this is a very
hopeful kind of picture.

685e7667-2766-479c-a526-ad4fa39cbaf5-0
00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.140
There they're coming into a city
looks like New York.

f6ac62c7-c8a3-4fc0-9366-4bdd807f8ef5-0
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.920
And they are looking at.

7c2d0aaa-d633-417f-b9c0-9b825c03f7ce-0
00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:00.894
A couple of people who appear to
be the heads of State, probably.

7c2d0aaa-d633-417f-b9c0-9b825c03f7ce-1
00:27:00.894 --> 00:27:07.330
One with an animal on his arm,
and these people are.

edf7a287-9390-4132-84c4-7322e2960cab-0
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:14.517
Shaking hands or doing a fist
bump. One has a bird on his

edf7a287-9390-4132-84c4-7322e2960cab-1
00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:20.220
shoulder and the other one has
maybe a rabbit with a long tail.

5de716ac-c629-4624-a8b6-babc0d328ba3-0
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.010
And they are peacefully
conferring. Appears to be. There

5de716ac-c629-4624-a8b6-babc0d328ba3-1
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.300
is another boat in the harbor.
Looks to be a ferry boat.

dbc11441-2099-484c-994e-0265c3720e51-0
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:37.920
So this is a bunch of people
coming from a foreign land into.

c07e82ea-11d9-45bd-97eb-11c6283d46a4-0
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.390
The city.

ff248964-70b7-4f93-98e4-561c11d76274-0
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.320
Oh quite big great big ocean
liner.

78a2209c-e08b-43f4-9d6a-9699ed69863d-0
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.670
Uh.

db1be84f-bb50-4c72-a75d-4eecaa66c132-0
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.290
That's a lot larger than the
ferry boat.

8fa62293-c4b2-42d0-8c0d-205ae0f375ca-0
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.641
And now we see some of these
people close up, what they look

8fa62293-c4b2-42d0-8c0d-205ae0f375ca-1
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:00.000
like.

3529b2b8-ac2e-40eb-b721-466fe22650a9-0
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.390
And uh.

fdf7d496-c745-42a3-a1bc-c717f056c004-0
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:15.379
We are connecting to the shore
and the people are getting off

fdf7d496-c745-42a3-a1bc-c717f056c004-1
00:28:15.379 --> 00:28:16.450
of the ship.

8bd56279-9c5a-4c6a-b94a-fbe728af88c0-0
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.570
And they appear to be huddled
there and.

23c8bad4-fbf7-4de2-aeed-e092230aed3a-0
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.954
Probably not knowing what's
happening. They all have

23c8bad4-fbf7-4de2-aeed-e092230aed3a-1
00:28:26.954 --> 00:28:30.810
luggage. Not very much luggage,
but something with them.

d1e0f577-aeb1-4077-9916-829cfceed498-0
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.469
It appears that, that is, this
is a new beginning for them.

d1e0f577-aeb1-4077-9916-829cfceed498-1
00:28:34.469 --> 00:28:35.160
#END_arrival_2

ee4e9b75-0957-45e2-94f1-2fa49a787512-0
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.979
OK, so that was the story, um,
in the beginning we said that

ee4e9b75-0957-45e2-94f1-2fa49a787512-1
00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:47.370
there will be two types of
pictures. You've seen some

ee4e9b75-0957-45e2-94f1-2fa49a787512-2
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:51.680
graphic novels and the other
type is complex scenes.

79f97b11-0050-4fdf-ab9b-4d18c76240a5-0
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:56.587
Imagine you're describing the
scene as someone who cannot see

79f97b11-0050-4fdf-ab9b-4d18c76240a5-1
00:28:56.587 --> 00:29:00.261
the picture. Describe what is
happening and what you see in

79f97b11-0050-4fdf-ab9b-4d18c76240a5-2
00:29:00.261 --> 00:29:03.691
the scene as thoroughly as
possible. Please try to take

79f97b11-0050-4fdf-ab9b-4d18c76240a5-3
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:05.590
between three and five minutes.

1f1af9b1-8950-4bd4-8659-0097049f5c8f-0
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.670
So this next item is a complex
scene.

66f1e16e-3d11-4f0c-be51-1f33765d89a4-0
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:30.804
This is one picture. It is on 2
pages of just one scene on 2

66f1e16e-3d11-4f0c-be51-1f33765d89a4-1
00:29:30.804 --> 00:29:31.370
pages.

5d3b80bf-87c6-4cc8-a6d1-8d1d426b413e-0
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.156
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
Now we've got here something

5d3b80bf-87c6-4cc8-a6d1-8d1d426b413e-1
00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:43.511
that entitled dinosaurs,
spacemen and ghouls, like a take

5d3b80bf-87c6-4cc8-a6d1-8d1d426b413e-2
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:46.440
on them from a movie they're
shooting.

158b0b7c-56f4-40c1-b2e3-73f5c277db1e-0
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.430
uh it's a scene.

3fca3cf0-752c-4771-a190-f2fd75a6a334-0
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.965
There are dinosaurs on one part
of it, and in another part there

3fca3cf0-752c-4771-a190-f2fd75a6a334-1
00:29:54.965 --> 00:30:00.020
are spacemen and what appears to
be a machine that could get you

3fca3cf0-752c-4771-a190-f2fd75a6a334-2
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.720
to space.

9ff8d812-39d7-4162-9fce-03c4e5ba43e6-0
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:08.280
With other means of
transportation on water.

f47e3577-dc24-4c9f-bea5-998371a1ecdb-0
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.030
And the ghouls.

e8c679e3-3f55-45bd-ac21-eb8601ae82c1-0
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.360
Flying saucers.

adf631e1-c05f-41ae-aaba-cde377b8a2af-0
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:33.072
Also aliens, not actors. Anyway.
And then here are all the people

adf631e1-c05f-41ae-aaba-cde377b8a2af-1
00:30:33.072 --> 00:30:38.496
who are making this movie down
in the front part of it and the

adf631e1-c05f-41ae-aaba-cde377b8a2af-2
00:30:38.496 --> 00:30:43.919
extras and all of the people and
equipment that is being used.

c99b6aeb-415f-4d4a-8253-c5991c4455b8-0
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.470
So we see that they've got.

56dff70a-aed7-4541-937b-bd6ae2cf6f12-0
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.112
Very colorful dinosaurs, not so
colorful people wearing

56dff70a-aed7-4541-937b-bd6ae2cf6f12-1
00:30:56.112 --> 00:31:02.748
loincloths and rudimentary
clothes on one side. And so this

56dff70a-aed7-4541-937b-bd6ae2cf6f12-2
00:31:02.748 --> 00:31:08.720
is apparently going from way,
way back the dinosaurs.

40590ebd-6ecd-4bb7-b218-da509bedb72f-0
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:15.220
To something in the future, to
spaceman.

0cf6f320-3924-4339-821e-d0829b2adeb0-0
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.040
And those people are.

cb89ae85-d2d2-4a21-bea1-6bc2ba5f9bcc-0
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.530
It shows the scaffolding and all
of the.

3c2b72ea-6e97-4e54-ac96-123f2229af37-0
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.660
Props that are needed to.

9e570297-a33f-4d60-9c32-da8a4933aa2e-0
00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.510
Make this kind of a picture.

520f7d6e-ad36-403d-a09b-94f04f8e6d55-0
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.270
And all of the people who are
are being used to accomplish

520f7d6e-ad36-403d-a09b-94f04f8e6d55-1
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:42.710
that.

26200a0b-6632-49fb-913f-7b1941b6e4fa-0
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:44.700
Uh.

03397e26-a499-42d3-a5cd-41dbf94a44a8-0
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.010
That.

a8dd46ef-4d98-4671-9579-6979951dca66-0
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.370
Uh.

9caa30cc-93af-4a45-a8bb-26f8b286615e-0
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:03.140
There are a lot of cameras up
above and.

a7202bb8-18cc-4e1f-b146-08ed066de5c3-0
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.480
Showing all the lights.

782ce89b-bd9b-4ed9-a5d0-c96dec2379fe-0
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:13.195
Here are a couple of the people
who are, looks as if they've got

782ce89b-bd9b-4ed9-a5d0-c96dec2379fe-1
00:32:13.195 --> 00:32:17.220
a volcano going there with the
dinosaurs and.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.710
Anyway.

d90802d2-f8a6-4a14-ad08-f56b4f7c246e-0
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.552

00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:25.700
OK.

b455dbc0-3e2e-45ac-ab6f-95d428eea325-0
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.950
And we can go on to the next
one.

07608a33-0fc5-44ea-be5e-d1c75ac95609-0
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:37.044
This next item is a again a
graphic novel, so please tell

00:32:37.044 --> 00:32:42.666

15 minutes.

#START_wanderer OK. We have a

00:32:51.244 --> 00:32:56.519
assembling what appears to be a
boat out of a single piece of

71b13fc6-f4bd-452a-97e4-c747391e7f43-2
00:32:56.519 --> 00:33:01.198

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:09.840
Uh.

97712711-1fea-452b-9424-ec83d39dabe8-0
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.140
And it could be described as a
paper hat.

91f23f79-f13a-4256-9eb1-bee709dd8646-0
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:23.422
Or something that people could
get inside and could sail away

91f23f79-f13a-4256-9eb1-bee709dd8646-1
00:33:23.422 --> 00:33:28.650
on that. They uh one of them has
got horns on him and.

c3b4cfa8-702d-46d5-94dc-ecb4f2db33cb-0
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:33.020
A costume or uniform.

fee9a6d6-bfee-4c64-85fb-ef7bfc85935c-0
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:43.880
Maybe, like some of the Vikings
who did sail in Viking ships a

fee9a6d6-bfee-4c64-85fb-ef7bfc85935c-1
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.790
long time ago.

fa78af56-3708-49ef-8fe1-c6ba7cc05704-0
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.440
And one of the other person is
appears to be a.

510e626c-e71b-4439-aaad-7163909f1033-0
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.417
A person who is living today is
just dressed very casually and

510e626c-e71b-4439-aaad-7163909f1033-1
00:33:58.417 --> 00:34:04.128
as if he might be near a beach,
and they appear to be near a

510e626c-e71b-4439-aaad-7163909f1033-2
00:34:04.128 --> 00:34:04.690
beach.

09bb4e23-f260-4ecd-9805-3dc0b1b7f356-0
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.620
In a place where it's very, very
casual.

2b9eca62-191f-4393-9dff-e33873e3e2fe-0
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.230
And not at all high tech.

1f0feabd-8b9a-448e-919c-a48a396d20b3-0
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:27.530
Contrast this rudimentary boat
that they have assembled.

c9664635-6627-4619-9d1c-f2caacd5ccef-0
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:35.633
With, and you see it now on the
water over on the right hand

c9664635-6627-4619-9d1c-f2caacd5ccef-1
00:34:35.633 --> 00:34:37.450
side compared with.

f4a957e7-d81e-4e5f-8993-03e3313cf837-0
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.920
Gigantic boat ship.

b4ad193a-8dde-477d-b28a-2fea00518da5-0
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.830
With, uh, a piece underneath it
to.

acf8156c-de82-41d7-aabc-99ba3292a412-0
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.670
Dive with looks as if it could
be.

de2401d6-d6ca-4d65-bf53-b9eadfd5e0c2-0
00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.210
Uh, disassembled from the boat
that is

c37d7b11-88bc-4804-b5d0-87faaad006d4-0
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:08.770
Is carrying it and people could
go in this to very deep water.

78dab18f-ee2c-43d3-8e34-54c409792131-0
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:14.780
And on this ship, there are a
lot of balloons.

374daf3b-862e-42e3-9190-99610bb1d887-0
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.536
That are carrying it where it
needs to go, and the ladder is

374daf3b-862e-42e3-9190-99610bb1d887-1
00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:26.757
to get up to those balloons. And
it looks like quite a city on

374daf3b-862e-42e3-9190-99610bb1d887-2
00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:32.062
this ship all by itself, but a
lot of people on it. And there's

374daf3b-862e-42e3-9190-99610bb1d887-3
00:35:32.062 --> 00:35:36.870
a propeller, an old-fashioned
propeller at the same time.

1385bc82-3d06-4c35-a61f-09e21cbe45f2-0
00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:43.731
But it is what has the the
original ship of the little, the

1385bc82-3d06-4c35-a61f-09e21cbe45f2-1
00:35:43.731 --> 00:35:44.450
little.

197ffa07-3221-4c79-ab59-9c6bf521db1f-0
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.680
Hat. Compared with what has.

2665e6ef-f880-42f7-a509-5041d5ec7a4d-0
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.550
People have been able to do to
improve on that.

5e072c59-e02c-4b12-922f-10af8df970ae-0
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:04.020
{This story is around 40 pages
long, so little longer than the

5e072c59-e02c-4b12-922f-10af8df970ae-1
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:09.031
other stories. Um, you can kind
of looking at that time to OK,

5e072c59-e02c-4b12-922f-10af8df970ae-2
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:11.020
then I need to go faster.

9c53dd31-950d-46ac-868c-6cea17aa01dc-0
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:12.990
Yeah.}

02a775f9-2d28-43eb-b54b-5212fa00e982-0
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:21.001
Now we have birds flying,
there's the little paper ship on

02a775f9-2d28-43eb-b54b-5212fa00e982-1
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:26.120
the sea, and these are gulls.
Gulls looks like.

0f723d6b-5bdb-44ea-8c21-258039e82829-0
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.710
That are flying over the ship,
over the little boats.

c5a73030-22f3-4b3e-8194-068a9420fed2-0
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.260
And in the water there is a
whale.

e8ce6b5b-faee-4840-b4df-ff50341ed5d6-0
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:45.052
And there are some turtles and
what me they must be the

e8ce6b5b-faee-4840-b4df-ff50341ed5d6-1
00:36:45.052 --> 00:36:49.745
turtles. And they're
investigating the little boat

e8ce6b5b-faee-4840-b4df-ff50341ed5d6-2
00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:52.690
that that we'll call it the hat.

8c8d7ad5-5237-4bc6-82ec-4e87837d6ad6-0
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:59.439
The hat and the gulls are flying
over, so they're all looking at

8c8d7ad5-5237-4bc6-82ec-4e87837d6ad6-1
00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:04.369
that. The whale is looking at
it, the Marlin, other fish, and

8c8d7ad5-5237-4bc6-82ec-4e87837d6ad6-2
00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:09.459
it looks like a coral reef here.
And the boat is coming up, the

8c8d7ad5-5237-4bc6-82ec-4e87837d6ad6-3
00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:14.708
wheel has come up underneath the
boat, so the boat is not even on

8c8d7ad5-5237-4bc6-82ec-4e87837d6ad6-4
00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:16.140
the water anymore.

b408d97d-c0e7-4a35-b2c2-6db02d01f504-0
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.960
And here is a.

2c16cffc-04c2-43da-a7a7-c35d8ce77a28-0
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:29.141
You have all of the creatures
that are in this coral area.

2c16cffc-04c2-43da-a7a7-c35d8ce77a28-1
00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:34.712
Here's the boat who is come up
on it that is no longer has

2c16cffc-04c2-43da-a7a7-c35d8ce77a28-2
00:37:34.712 --> 00:37:40.849
enough water to float on. So it
is on the boat on the reef along

2c16cffc-04c2-43da-a7a7-c35d8ce77a28-3
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:44.059
with all the fish who live
there.

f9623d7c-836c-454d-a0c5-81e1c3741478-0
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.330
Yep.

d8352993-7e2b-4daf-8b2d-5aab79c0c92a-0
00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.888
And now it's got enough water on
it so that it can go ahead and

d8352993-7e2b-4daf-8b2d-5aab79c0c92a-1
00:37:53.888 --> 00:37:58.799
there are some creatures that
again are investigating it from

d8352993-7e2b-4daf-8b2d-5aab79c0c92a-2
00:37:58.799 --> 00:38:03.393
this side. There are a lot of
fish that seem to be living

d8352993-7e2b-4daf-8b2d-5aab79c0c92a-3
00:38:03.393 --> 00:38:05.690
happily there, Pairs of fish,

46c79ab3-bbf9-449a-8899-21df5e42bd66-0
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.333
as well as other assorted. So
now we've got the boat. There's

46c79ab3-bbf9-449a-8899-21df5e42bd66-1
00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:15.326
a fishing pole coming off of the
boat and one of the fish has

46c79ab3-bbf9-449a-8899-21df5e42bd66-2
00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:18.739
been hooked on it, somebody's
fishing from the boat.

4495bb7c-5a00-4757-8451-ddf7a4b9496b-0
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:20.970
You.

49cb030d-d3d9-4ebd-986a-c944a6f8b006-0
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:31.691
Now here's another view of
everybody trying to get a view

49cb030d-d3d9-4ebd-986a-c944a6f8b006-1
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:32.920
of this boat.

5ae891d1-6fe8-4973-9700-2bbfd093dab6-0
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.770
Uh, and there is.

52cd2b15-b6db-431b-bfae-f8f255021978-0
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.300
They've got onto the boat, some
of them.

6b4ebcfb-f900-450d-a12c-1a7d230759fb-0
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.696
And one of the snakes from down
below has gotten onto the boat

6b4ebcfb-f900-450d-a12c-1a7d230759fb-1
00:38:45.696 --> 00:38:47.260
to see what's there.

81c52b29-715b-4e6b-a445-a451544c2f2f-0
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:54.060
And there were a lot of rays on
there underneath the water.

80c5c3c1-621f-4c2e-a19f-a87f37d6d9d1-0
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.553
OK, now we have what appear to
be birds. This is up above over

80c5c3c1-621f-4c2e-a19f-a87f37d6d9d1-1
00:39:02.553 --> 00:39:07.041
the water now, and these have
grown from the water and are

80c5c3c1-621f-4c2e-a19f-a87f37d6d9d1-2
00:39:07.041 --> 00:39:11.834
bushes or trees or where there
are a lot of birds gathered and

80c5c3c1-621f-4c2e-a19f-a87f37d6d9d1-3
00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:16.856
there's something in the boat. I
can't tell exactly what it is if

80c5c3c1-621f-4c2e-a19f-a87f37d6d9d1-4
00:39:16.856 --> 00:39:18.530
it's a small creature.

c2b1919a-1aeb-4db5-a36e-de73c068a0c7-0
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.780
And.

01ac690d-ca4d-45d5-ab8a-ba7059c5976a-0
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.690
Down is sort of showing fish
below the water surface and the

01ac690d-ca4d-45d5-ab8a-ba7059c5976a-1
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:30.070
boat.

6dc4a5b7-053f-43bf-aa3f-1f222f58832e-0
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:38.333
In these trees with the birds in
them, so it's a scene of an

6dc4a5b7-053f-43bf-aa3f-1f222f58832e-1
00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:41.300
ecological system, I would.

5ab20ec5-db43-4892-829f-6f641502b345-0
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:52.654
Now here we are. This looks like
a seahorse in the boat with a

5ab20ec5-db43-4892-829f-6f641502b345-1
00:39:52.654 --> 00:39:57.477
companion and they're in these
area of maybe these are

5ab20ec5-db43-4892-829f-6f641502b345-2
00:39:57.477 --> 00:40:01.160
mangroves. They are clearly some
aquatic.

27f410eb-53d9-4d3c-b490-414fff2b375d-0
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.360
Flora.

8264c86b-b223-46d7-b286-bd485cd167cc-0
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.340
And fauna.

3b9e1936-26fe-4997-b2f7-0cc5b64d63a3-0
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:13.415
And they look like creatures
with eyes that are looking at

3b9e1936-26fe-4997-b2f7-0cc5b64d63a3-1
00:40:13.415 --> 00:40:17.200
the boat to see what's going on
with it.

7fc77f05-d7a3-43e2-acc2-7aaafbc7764f-0
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.447
And now we have more underwater
creatures in the boat going

7fc77f05-d7a3-43e2-acc2-7aaafbc7764f-1
00:40:25.447 --> 00:40:25.940
along.

469c3211-43d3-444e-a103-860cb465b1cf-0
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.922
The seahorse and companion
looking out to see what's going

469c3211-43d3-444e-a103-860cb465b1cf-1
00:40:32.922 --> 00:40:38.384
on and other seahorses who are
under the water who have seen

469c3211-43d3-444e-a103-860cb465b1cf-2
00:40:38.384 --> 00:40:43.935
this boat go by. And the sea
horse in the boat has jumped out

469c3211-43d3-444e-a103-860cb465b1cf-3
00:40:43.935 --> 00:40:49.665
to the other seahorses that he
has seen under beneath the water

469c3211-43d3-444e-a103-860cb465b1cf-4
00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:52.710
and he's very interested in
them.

a79aa796-9d0e-4c7b-9a28-6f961aeab11e-0
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.840
And here's the whale.

431ab5a4-f428-4ea5-a09f-82e85f8ba12d-0
00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.350
With a bunch of creatures on
him.

316c0155-4381-455a-8bdf-7193e8a103bf-0
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:08.820
Uh, looking at the boat and
hanging something from head.

60a87a5c-5247-4fb0-9d9d-787e0ca27ee8-0
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:18.248
So this is a female whale, maybe
a very enticing and is trying to

60a87a5c-5247-4fb0-9d9d-787e0ca27ee8-1
00:41:18.248 --> 00:41:20.950
lure the boat closer.

6022e0ad-624f-4be5-bdf6-ccbcb31cb8be-0
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:34.261
Now here's the boat in with a
bunch of creatures who are now

6022e0ad-624f-4be5-bdf6-ccbcb31cb8be-1
00:41:34.261 --> 00:41:35.720
above the water.

cff6b707-eb23-4dc2-a39a-44beaba6c15c-0
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.850
And some of them are in the air,
and the boat appears to have

cff6b707-eb23-4dc2-a39a-44beaba6c15c-1
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.290
been.

0a076fbb-0263-4a73-a66a-ca77c748251c-0
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.918
There's nobody in it except for
this creature that's going to

0a076fbb-0263-4a73-a66a-ca77c748251c-1
00:41:47.918 --> 00:41:52.629
leap into it. But the seahorse
has gone to meet his friends

0a076fbb-0263-4a73-a66a-ca77c748251c-2
00:41:52.629 --> 00:41:56.791
underneath the ocean,
apparently, and so the boat is

0a076fbb-0263-4a73-a66a-ca77c748251c-3
00:41:56.791 --> 00:41:59.540
left to the vagaries of the
tides.

13c3adda-e87f-4cea-9d8c-6dd1c0429438-0
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:10.638
And here is the boat out on the
water by itself. Uh, with the

13c3adda-e87f-4cea-9d8c-6dd1c0429438-1
00:42:10.638 --> 00:42:17.620
stars in the sky and the moon. A
partial moon. Again, very calm.

39801338-7391-4925-8392-2c165a4be0a8-0
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.260
uh landscape.

ed620a28-f86d-47ee-969f-baff7dc7db05-0
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:26.043
Hard to tell what's going on. We
don't see all of the creatures.

ed620a28-f86d-47ee-969f-baff7dc7db05-1
00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:30.560
Whoops. Now we have the boat
here with a lot of interested.

995debcb-e404-44ca-924b-181fa523008f-0
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.480
creatures

9dc5ac24-c3cd-47c9-a061-2423a537bcc6-0
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:42.082
Fish, underwater creatures who
have come up to see what this

9dc5ac24-c3cd-47c9-a061-2423a537bcc6-1
00:42:42.082 --> 00:42:44.470
boat is. It's surrounded it.

86fd1b62-7794-4725-82aa-3c60398482e7-0
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.921
Now the boat is sailing into
what looks to be a giant

86fd1b62-7794-4725-82aa-3c60398482e7-1
00:42:50.921 --> 00:42:51.620
curtain.

fd3d637a-65d7-4b8c-91f1-09c045e9b601-0
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:58.580
Coming out of the sky, we'll see
what that is about. Everything

fd3d637a-65d7-4b8c-91f1-09c045e9b601-1
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.410
has been in black and white so
far.

ecff9539-cda2-4450-8e8e-c3651c1e3c45-0
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.326
And now we have something coming
out of the water and the boat is

ecff9539-cda2-4450-8e8e-c3651c1e3c45-1
00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:10.080
going to have to sail around it.

3395738d-516a-4ccd-92bc-6ba2730b02e8-0
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:12.240


7da593a8-3968-4d3d-aef1-781690a6bb6b-0
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.405
Because, oops, now it's able to
go through it. There are things

7da593a8-3968-4d3d-aef1-781690a6bb6b-1
00:43:18.405 --> 00:43:23.425
in it, and it's hard to tell
where it may go, but the boat

7da593a8-3968-4d3d-aef1-781690a6bb6b-2
00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:28.189
seems to be without any kind of
navigation, any rudder.

7cfa3764-90bd-4e09-9efb-b1fd0a843c21-0
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.350
It's just going to go where it
will go.

68ab5c1a-3780-4fb9-ac76-1d9562fe27ea-0
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.729
And now there is something
coming up underneath the boat

68ab5c1a-3780-4fb9-ac76-1d9562fe27ea-1
00:43:42.729 --> 00:43:45.430
and it looks as if it's a diver.

327aa668-c01a-4aea-aee5-d610edb74f40-0
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:53.490
Who is surrounded with things
has many ways of of doing

327aa668-c01a-4aea-aee5-d610edb74f40-1
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.060
something to the boat.

28f3e6c5-a892-4700-b6a3-b2b36d3977a9-0
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:01.730
And he's got it in his hand and
he's seeing what it is. Many

28f3e6c5-a892-4700-b6a3-b2b36d3977a9-1
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.690
things going on here, not sure
what.

6c877c1b-51ac-4bd0-a19c-8e596f7ac571-0
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.440
And now,

0d4ba2c8-4995-4980-b5e7-dc1baab6d328-0
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.900
The boat.

ea6a9f92-4d86-4d63-bf93-e531a5cbd0d7-0
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:20.497
Is left by the wayside here as
this gigantic ocean liner comes

ea6a9f92-4d86-4d63-bf93-e531a5cbd0d7-1
00:44:20.497 --> 00:44:20.790
up.

0b375074-6cec-4b72-b33d-3a22e7a172a0-0
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:28.723
And we see that it has an anchor
on it and it is floating by

0b375074-6cec-4b72-b33d-3a22e7a172a0-1
00:44:28.723 --> 00:44:30.540
these trees and.

287dfe37-a024-4afb-a041-44cf479e2212-0
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.470
Whatever it is there that is
coming out from the water.

0638824e-eade-4c0d-9dfd-d640a30e7c6b-0
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:52.594
And this is night time and the
birds are flying. They're one of

0638824e-eade-4c0d-9dfd-d640a30e7c6b-1
00:44:52.594 --> 00:44:53.250
them has.

217fede0-10a9-41d0-b7fe-c831ea4cf29d-0
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.430
Stopped in the boat.

0607ab5e-9d06-49eb-aa30-fb7d185937a9-0
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.710
And.

08ed6f4f-1b55-4370-b6f8-881f315cb9f0-0
00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.820
They're diving into the water.

799c09f0-8e5e-4aa5-9542-9e142b131b2c-0
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.943
To see what's there. And in the
background there is a what looks

799c09f0-8e5e-4aa5-9542-9e142b131b2c-1
00:45:10.943 --> 00:45:12.050
to be a castle.

d092f1e6-d4ec-4302-b0b3-259cc0f46344-0
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.130
Has come up out of the water and
it is.

9c5c0d64-de11-45e1-b875-0a15b16a84fb-0
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.376
Has fish on it and cranes on it
and it looks to be there is

9c5c0d64-de11-45e1-b875-0a15b16a84fb-1
00:45:23.376 --> 00:45:27.050
something being built there on
platform.

947adcc9-a9a9-4469-a7d5-0526488c72f8-0
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.270
For the trees in the background.

961f0f0e-02c8-4fd0-8795-e40ae904f1d6-0
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:39.160
Now there is coming out of the
sky what appear to be.

5d964390-86c9-498d-971b-21503ff3ed7b-0
00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.890
Bombardments of something.

c39c10b2-e1ab-4496-b483-5d7794b22a1a-0
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:52.102
From the side of the boat,
possibly we have the anchor

c39c10b2-e1ab-4496-b483-5d7794b22a1a-1
00:45:52.102 --> 00:45:57.610
ready to drop and now we have
the diver who.

b35117a9-a1c8-402d-a7da-ffa6a4a8fbe9-0
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.990
Appears to have been on a
rocket.

fb12f509-7783-430f-b709-5c54313e53e9-0
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:09.389
The rocket maybe has been
underneath the water. Here's the

fb12f509-7783-430f-b709-5c54313e53e9-1
00:46:09.389 --> 00:46:14.962
little paper boat again and
there is something in it. Maybe

fb12f509-7783-430f-b709-5c54313e53e9-2
00:46:14.962 --> 00:46:16.820
a life raft, a life.

2a33c0b9-10a2-495d-af73-433c97b88946-0
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.610
Life saver.

deb84b70-728d-4f0f-9d1f-19e9165edac4-0
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.360
sort of thing.

a4e0521a-bae2-4bb8-9693-07c539b5584b-0
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:30.928
So here's the boat again, with
the diver investigating it, and

a4e0521a-bae2-4bb8-9693-07c539b5584b-1
00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:33.380
now we have from the land.

dd6af5ae-943a-4764-acc9-1fb3ba50a0e3-0
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.650
Horses and.

fbede289-8ac0-46ea-bdc1-b6bbf20a282d-0
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.670
A whale is coming.

fbb5baee-dc45-480f-aa77-3063f7a0a429-0
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.560
Bunch of creatures. A cat.

a8eb488e-fb33-4fd7-aefa-c30df7840d06-0
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:46.760
Uh.

0fd0f918-a240-4420-900c-74a71cae49c6-0
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:56.392
Several things. Hard to tell
what they are, whether they're

0fd0f918-a240-4420-900c-74a71cae49c6-1
00:46:56.392 --> 00:47:02.200
aquatic or what. And then we
have the original Viking person

0fd0f918-a240-4420-900c-74a71cae49c6-2
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.390
with the horns and the.

d6cd5bcf-912d-4b49-9c51-547f17fef775-0
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.940
Uniform with a cape.

8794b436-cc73-4ad4-962c-6167582b07b6-0
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:16.321
Now here's a big wave that is
bringing everyone together.

8794b436-cc73-4ad4-962c-6167582b07b6-1
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:19.610
People are having fun. They're
in a kite.

7007ef6a-9070-40b6-a9f2-a433d1018c10-0
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.871
Flying through the air, the
horses are trying to get up on

7007ef6a-9070-40b6-a9f2-a433d1018c10-1
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:29.410
what looks to be a giant snail.

023176d2-d441-44ad-88d4-d73ee432477a-0
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.440
And the wave is.

9586a6ca-5db5-470e-b803-8d8aa8532b5e-0
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:40.568
The boat is coming unraveled and
back to its original piece of

9586a6ca-5db5-470e-b803-8d8aa8532b5e-1
00:47:40.568 --> 00:47:43.770
paper, or its flat sheet, we
should say.

99719268-4abf-49e4-82e4-a32da90fd059-0
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:48.360
As the no, there it is
underneath the wave.

98972afe-d776-465f-8662-f9996dbeb411-0
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:55.350
Right there on the left and the
wave is overwhelming everybody.

cbc5c939-614d-4cc7-b339-2ff5f5b13c64-0
00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:07.041
Now we have a storm with
lightning and Thunder. And here

cbc5c939-614d-4cc7-b339-2ff5f5b13c64-1
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:12.417
is the man's missive,
apparently. His paper airplane

cbc5c939-614d-4cc7-b339-2ff5f5b13c64-2
00:48:12.417 --> 00:48:13.330
that has.

dc2a4f2e-4075-42f1-bdf5-770d6b9265f0-0
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.880
Flown out from where he?

c76b4618-973f-433e-bc7e-4c2cf585151c-0
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.330
Send it when he came on to the
shore.

7010d12b-d37e-43c3-b843-fc158d4d3d8f-0
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.755
And here is the boat again. And
there have been there's a lot of

7010d12b-d37e-43c3-b843-fc158d4d3d8f-1
00:48:32.755 --> 00:48:35.380
snail, and not snails, but
snakes.

e64cc6a4-580c-45fa-8f4b-2590c5db19e7-0
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.171
Aquatic creatures which have
taken over the they're coming up

e64cc6a4-580c-45fa-8f4b-2590c5db19e7-1
00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:46.743
out of the sea, and the boat is
going to have to make its way

e64cc6a4-580c-45fa-8f4b-2590c5db19e7-2
00:48:46.743 --> 00:48:48.440
through these openings.

f3ceeb14-b8e9-40e6-a701-aeb60e08ee03-0
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:59.102
And here is a sea horse of some
kind there. The boat is

f3ceeb14-b8e9-40e6-a701-aeb60e08ee03-1
00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:06.443
threading its way through trying
to get to outside of this this

f3ceeb14-b8e9-40e6-a701-aeb60e08ee03-2
00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:11.490
overwhelming snake like
creatures that are.

fd700dea-10b9-4f01-b979-66040c82641e-0
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:18.061
Somewhat threatening, but it
appears there are some friendly

fd700dea-10b9-4f01-b979-66040c82641e-1
00:49:18.061 --> 00:49:20.440
creatures at the end of this
tunnel.

b9e0ce17-3586-4747-9461-d7a7de881fa0-0
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.040
Where the boat is coming out by
itself.

b0ef4b8a-f645-42dc-b8f9-06f7b91d09d3-0
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.337
And the boat has made it. It's
being filled with water from

b0ef4b8a-f645-42dc-b8f9-06f7b91d09d3-1
00:49:34.337 --> 00:49:39.749
these whales and friendly
creatures. And there's another

b0ef4b8a-f645-42dc-b8f9-06f7b91d09d3-2
00:49:39.749 --> 00:49:45.446
one up here on the land that
looks like a beach that people

b0ef4b8a-f645-42dc-b8f9-06f7b91d09d3-3
00:49:45.446 --> 00:49:49.530
have made a mess of. And this
creature is.

c242a137-2b7b-4063-b6eb-eac558bb9620-0
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:56.570
Hard to tell whether it's fish
or fowl. It's got wings and.

af1ed3cb-8083-4efc-90e3-2d6b5a9853d4-0
00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:57.650
Uh.

000aee24-bbc5-4a6f-a15c-54209bfd96f3-0
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:08.797
It appears to be a friendly
creature, but the whales uni

000aee24-bbc5-4a6f-a15c-54209bfd96f3-1
00:50:08.797 --> 00:50:11.470
with a Unicorn horn on it.

059106d4-427e-4589-987e-5b1c5ff7d4c9-0
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.750
It's hard to tell if they are
friendly or not to the boat.

143ece28-4a03-4c76-a4b1-ca8e4f547e07-0
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:27.370
Now we have a lot of jellyfish,
inundated with jellyfish, and

143ece28-4a03-4c76-a4b1-ca8e4f547e07-1
00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:31.660
the boat is floating in the sea
of jellyfish.

c4bf6056-79f3-4286-b3a7-f9bbc54ad69c-0
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.470
And they're all gathered to see
what it is.

36d7241c-231a-4283-a6c5-1d2b08940c71-0
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:45.202
And here it is again. More fish.
The boat is kind of flying in

36d7241c-231a-4283-a6c5-1d2b08940c71-1
00:50:45.202 --> 00:50:50.555
with all of these other
creatures way down deep in the

36d7241c-231a-4283-a6c5-1d2b08940c71-2
00:50:50.555 --> 00:50:51.140
water.

9a2e943f-acf6-4356-bb07-889ea5c34157-0
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:58.386
And now here is a light shining
on some baby creatures of some

9a2e943f-acf6-4356-bb07-889ea5c34157-1
00:50:58.386 --> 00:51:04.570
kind. The boat is in there, and
here is a sunken boat, now that

9a2e943f-acf6-4356-bb07-889ea5c34157-2
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:05.730
this little.

40d5aafc-0cb1-488e-9076-47d122bd3cf0-0
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:14.409
Boat is passing by. We see this,
the wreckage of a former large,

40d5aafc-0cb1-488e-9076-47d122bd3cf0-1
00:51:14.409 --> 00:51:17.090
large boat that has sunk.

43b53120-966d-4004-953a-f3b07c4b84ec-0
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.310
Down here there is another sea
serpent.

e160374d-885b-4931-89ba-658de0bd67bd-0
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.900
And here is a close up of the
sunken boat.

90c83cae-321d-42a9-bcc5-5b24bb45a65d-0
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:35.572
That which is holding up the
little boat from which there is

90c83cae-321d-42a9-bcc5-5b24bb45a65d-1
00:51:35.572 --> 00:51:40.965
water pouring out, and the other
boat it looks like a pleasure

90c83cae-321d-42a9-bcc5-5b24bb45a65d-2
00:51:40.965 --> 00:51:45.760
boat that has been engulfed by
creatures from the deep.

f8cbc140-3dc6-4c9d-b0cb-d6137beb54cd-0
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:52.250
Whales and star sea serpents and
so forth. And here are seals

f8cbc140-3dc6-4c9d-b0cb-d6137beb54cd-1
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:56.040
that are playing with the little
paper boat.

fced0506-25db-489d-9ea8-205092270590-0
00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:59.030
The.

76b8dcea-5d86-48af-9faa-4701715073f9-0
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.450
Fish and Flora and the coral
reefs are.

33353117-4405-4360-91cd-3a889a24ed86-0
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:16.557
Growing underneath the sky with
the clouds look appears to be a

33353117-4405-4360-91cd-3a889a24ed86-1
00:52:16.557 --> 00:52:20.586
nice day up above and all of
these things are going on

33353117-4405-4360-91cd-3a889a24ed86-2
00:52:20.586 --> 00:52:24.761
underneath the sea, but the
seals are having a good time

33353117-4405-4360-91cd-3a889a24ed86-3
00:52:24.761 --> 00:52:26.300
with the little boat.

ac7c3fca-a6d3-4b43-910a-5370e3f583af-0
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:35.214
And here is the diver, seeing
all kinds of interesting fish

ac7c3fca-a6d3-4b43-910a-5370e3f583af-1
00:52:35.214 --> 00:52:40.862
down here, and the little boat
has now has another little boat,

ac7c3fca-a6d3-4b43-910a-5370e3f583af-2
00:52:40.862 --> 00:52:45.981
and they are bobbing on the
surface and all the creatures

ac7c3fca-a6d3-4b43-910a-5370e3f583af-3
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:49.070

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:57.872
And here we have a lighthouse
and the boats are passing by the

9bd6d3f4-6ad0-4664-9d4a-732d8be9d479-1
00:52:57.872 --> 00:53:00.210

Diver on his looks to be some
kind of a he's riding something.

e8721785-5efd-46e7-8361-32ca25757f9a-0
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.650
And there's a buoy. The
creatures are trying to climb up

e8721785-5efd-46e7-8361-32ca25757f9a-1
00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:19.154
the buoy and the birds are on
top of it. Difficult day on the

e8721785-5efd-46e7-8361-32ca25757f9a-2
00:53:19.154 --> 00:53:19.590
water.

f1b1feec-91fa-4f3c-bdf8-6f426292739d-0
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:26.854
And ships in the background,
there's a gigantic bridge, boats

f1b1feec-91fa-4f3c-bdf8-6f426292739d-1
00:53:26.854 --> 00:53:31.480
of all kinds going by, and fish
underneath the sea.

1857a2d0-e678-4d4d-a500-7e363870f99f-0
00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:40.182
And steamboat and a sailboat.
Forget what they're called, but

1857a2d0-e678-4d4d-a500-7e363870f99f-1
00:53:40.182 --> 00:53:44.700

And what looks like a.

8e196450-a4e2-45cb-aa44-e065c0bf1b5a-0
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:56.140

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.040
Celebration at the end of a long
pier.

8bc6a1d2-bdad-4035-a4f5-394ec022095b-0
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.960
And here is the bottom of the.

222967dd-47ac-4469-b43d-d51664f5f0ec-0
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:14.051
Ocean liner with a small boat
coming next to it. A tugboat.

222967dd-47ac-4469-b43d-d51664f5f0ec-1
00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:17.490
It's coming into the harbor of
the city.

2b3c98b1-67c2-4f81-95b3-b1e64a17d1cd-0
00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:22.320
And.

29269d0e-05e7-4a73-bf6e-12e6759570db-0
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.690
Here is the whale coming up from

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:36.920
Deep. And the ocean liners with
all of the people greeting them.

de8a8969-e555-4877-92ef-d3fd7d282178-0
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:42.880
And the tugboat has brought it
in to the port.

b4b3eaa3-c7af-4381-82b3-cd759321a019-0
00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:48.708
Here's our little boat again,
who has survived this journey

b4b3eaa3-c7af-4381-82b3-cd759321a019-1
00:54:48.708 --> 00:54:52.210
and has come at the same time as
the giant boat.

da845660-a69a-4054-8a40-90074d368ff6-0
00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:59.922
And it's still there in the
harbor keeping an eye on

da845660-a69a-4054-8a40-90074d368ff6-1
00:54:59.922 --> 00:55:02.800
everything that's going on and
here is.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:12.179
Thing that with where they
descend into the deep. I forget

875ed719-f976-454f-adfa-5e16a6f2533e-1
00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:17.010
what they're called with what it
looks to be an amalgam of.

28a11b40-b6e4-4b5b-9ef9-e6d5df358fa1-0
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:21.760
The seahorse and other diver.

83ea36bf-e00f-4409-9378-220b5b37cba4-0
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.390
And.

8717ff25-9ef7-43c0-95e6-01116b392a33-0
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.470
The city going on in back of the
building being built.

14eee1ca-1c1c-459e-9eac-844b03664350-0
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:34.360
Now we have we have caught some
creatures.

d84a652e-aa56-45af-9e74-6de855cff6c6-0
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.146
Uh, that are coming up on this
boat that looks to be like a

d84a652e-aa56-45af-9e74-6de855cff6c6-1
00:55:40.146 --> 00:55:43.260
ferry boat. And they're
observing that the.

397804cb-11bd-4d9d-8220-f99fe88632df-0
00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.800
The little paper boat.

6df3e7ed-9446-4a4a-b10c-899b22344c48-0
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:49.230
Uh.

2f21fe29-11f1-4158-94e2-2225db84e8bd-0
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.991
That boat is still in the harbor
here, looking at what's going on

2f21fe29-11f1-4158-94e2-2225db84e8bd-1
00:55:56.991 --> 00:56:01.530
with all of the buildings that
are part of the landscape now.

7f67f3ca-fea3-4e03-bd72-34078ddd0134-0
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:16.693
Here is the city looking down on
it with this creature with the

7f67f3ca-fea3-4e03-bd72-34078ddd0134-1
00:56:16.693 --> 00:56:22.567
wings and the bathing suit and
the spots on him and wings not

7f67f3ca-fea3-4e03-bd72-34078ddd0134-2
00:56:22.567 --> 00:56:23.610
wings, but.

4e81c5bb-c5fc-4973-aa10-dcc7f22545f7-0
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:30.033
Propellers that like a
helicopter who is able to go

4e81c5bb-c5fc-4973-aa10-dcc7f22545f7-1
00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:35.010
anywhere, apparently winging his
way over this city.

de64091d-dfdd-470b-a823-c9d701272e94-0
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.548
Which has the river going
through it and the little boat

de64091d-dfdd-470b-a823-c9d701272e94-1
00:56:40.548 --> 00:56:43.460
on the river. So it's a part of
the whole.

b1af1ff3-254e-4c55-85a9-224110db9af2-0
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.410
Of the city.

164799f4-07c8-4725-becb-e8a98d94c8b5-0
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.731
And here is a close up of the
little boat and all of the

164799f4-07c8-4725-becb-e8a98d94c8b5-1
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:59.259
revelers here are the people who
are have been involved in this

164799f4-07c8-4725-becb-e8a98d94c8b5-2
00:56:59.259 --> 00:57:02.230
story with a cat up at the top
the horse.

60df3058-3a9a-49c1-80d5-780aed3a0722-0
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:06.120
Harlequins.

67ddfa17-383f-4c3f-b5c5-2cd8e1e47448-0
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:10.160
What looks like a snail.
Gigantic snail.

15a040c5-c915-450e-969f-6ba21ecaa556-0
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.300
Sea monsters.

5c0b8dca-532b-4f6c-bff1-bc56774d16cc-0
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.960
These are.

fbeeb39d-132a-4fbe-8aa9-4d49b4a765f1-0
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:22.904
This is where the river is going
underneath the city, and there

fbeeb39d-132a-4fbe-8aa9-4d49b4a765f1-1
00:57:22.904 --> 00:57:26.950
goes the little paper boat,
still intact.

6777bcd7-c034-44a6-8434-51bc6f5e53c8-0
00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.030
Another closer up of a little
little.

621091fb-db57-42b3-8daa-32832e8f602c-0
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:41.540
tugboat.

4d385e9c-9c1b-4258-a0f0-b339bcdf3edf-0
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:51.269
And the stair is going on up to
the surrounding the river in the

4d385e9c-9c1b-4258-a0f0-b339bcdf3edf-1
00:57:51.269 --> 00:57:54.780
city. So you have the the case.

95a5e410-92b3-446e-9796-3fe498c639c8-0
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.190
Here's your boat again, still
floating in the river.

82e7e91e-5f1b-4ee0-9c85-f1350568944d-0
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:09.222
And now there is somebody in it.
This is a person, appears to be,

82e7e91e-5f1b-4ee0-9c85-f1350568944d-1
00:58:09.222 --> 00:58:11.510
who is going from the boat.

c6f6ce4e-6019-4efc-8406-a617b941d1cd-0
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:17.077
He must have come out from the
river and is going up onto the

c6f6ce4e-6019-4efc-8406-a617b941d1cd-1
00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:21.214
land and seeing somebody else up
there greeting someone up there.

c6f6ce4e-6019-4efc-8406-a617b941d1cd-2
00:58:21.214 --> 00:58:22.030

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:30.484
OK, that was a long story and
it's it's a real. OK that was

43cbadd1-a9ed-42d3-8fd3-d766c9674011-1
00:58:30.484 --> 00:58:31.060
good.

1690070b-a047-44f0-84aa-dfbe4a1fe899-0
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:38.419
And moving on, this is a complex
scene. Please describe what you

1690070b-a047-44f0-84aa-dfbe4a1fe899-1
00:58:38.419 --> 00:58:42.400
see and what is happening in
this scene.

95bee8ff-c73e-4fad-a74f-aa4486910792-0
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.830
With details and please take
between three and five minutes.

5eec467e-cd70-42a4-8696-e57d8c121987-0
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:55.622
#START_being_a_pirate OK, 150
years, 250 years ago being a

5eec467e-cd70-42a4-8696-e57d8c121987-1
00:58:55.622 --> 00:59:00.733
pirate. And so this is
apparently a depiction of a

5eec467e-cd70-42a4-8696-e57d8c121987-2
00:59:00.733 --> 00:59:03.840
pirate ship, and the pirate is.

cdcaa59c-dbf1-4989-9080-aabdb40609f4-0
00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.140
No.

a9721fec-3f71-400d-a161-dffd77dc37ca-0
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:13.591
All of these little boats are
coming out and from the land

a9721fec-3f71-400d-a161-dffd77dc37ca-1
00:59:13.591 --> 00:59:19.519
they're shooting from the land.
It's hard to tell exactly what's

a9721fec-3f71-400d-a161-dffd77dc37ca-2
00:59:19.519 --> 00:59:24.627
happening because there are
shots being fired from this

a9721fec-3f71-400d-a161-dffd77dc37ca-3
00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:29.370
boat. Hard to tell who are the
pirates and who are.

987f5e84-7c65-4bb3-a6e8-b346de7354f5-0
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:31.900
Dash.

63992421-a869-4c59-aae9-94c5e50294ea-0
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.290
We've got a part. Here's the
pirate ship.

a53a5b5a-fc91-40e6-bd03-acec26e465e2-0
00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:39.730
Just one.

ec47a89b-3450-4e72-ae00-2c64594b6807-0
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:46.670
At least it has the Jolly Roger
or the on it.

615b078c-7672-4b7d-9e73-cf8f977544ba-0
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.740
Uh.

34deddc8-b271-45fa-ad60-e627aeaa6b53-0
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:57.029
And they're firing on this boat,
or they're firing from the boat.

34deddc8-b271-45fa-ad60-e627aeaa6b53-1
00:59:57.029 --> 01:00:01.361
And it's really difficult to
say, oh, here's another boat

34deddc8-b271-45fa-ad60-e627aeaa6b53-2
01:00:01.361 --> 01:00:04.050
over here, this one here, which
is.

2aa4fb12-4bac-46f5-8c20-3480c7451550-0
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:09.989
that the pirate that looks to be
a pirate ship, and there's a

2aa4fb12-4bac-46f5-8c20-3480c7451550-1
01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:13.899
small one. To tell the truth,
it's very difficult for me to

2aa4fb12-4bac-46f5-8c20-3480c7451550-2
01:00:13.899 --> 01:00:16.310
tell what who's who in this
picture.

484f6306-379d-48d5-be07-82b156d32ad0-0
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.379
There is a an octopus in the
middle of it, who is taking in

484f6306-379d-48d5-be07-82b156d32ad0-1
01:00:22.379 --> 01:00:23.590
the whole thing.

10530883-7119-4a22-a981-af4421562399-0
01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:26.280
That's kind of fun.

ce194634-14a4-45e9-bf9d-2c1d4e9b82ed-0
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.515
And here is another boat that is
apparently capsized here in the

ce194634-14a4-45e9-bf9d-2c1d4e9b82ed-1
01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:34.430
middle of the thing. And here's
somebody out here.

e03c2ab3-c93d-4421-b11a-6ae0ec9d6874-0
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:42.428
None of the sails are up, but
everybody is out there trying to

e03c2ab3-c93d-4421-b11a-6ae0ec9d6874-1
01:00:42.428 --> 01:00:44.240
see what they can see.

d9e0565e-8e2f-4742-9f28-21f86d288af5-0
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:48.850
Hard to say.

dffe737d-dc71-4ffd-891d-4256fd445c37-0
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:50.990
Confusing.

a8e49c51-e83b-433f-9c61-422326c45ac3-0
01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.030
Yeah, one boat here that is
broken in half.

2075cc1c-4f85-4e6b-8b8f-1f79d313e240-0
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:05.220
And people are in the water, but
nobody seems to care much.

07adb494-0619-4983-a576-585882affd0b-0
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:11.710
OK.

deb43491-0ad2-450c-9441-934e9a856567-0
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.498
{Anything else you want to say
about this picture?} Well, I'm

deb43491-0ad2-450c-9441-934e9a856567-1
01:01:31.498 --> 01:01:35.375
looking, I'm trying to see,
trying to make out something

deb43491-0ad2-450c-9441-934e9a856567-2
01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:39.730
that I haven't seen in it. Have
a bunch of people in the water.

1bef3398-1036-4e56-988f-0329aaedb67e-0
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:44.200
It's really.

05899571-c8b8-4b4f-8366-28018cab2968-0
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.924
Hard to say who's who's getting
the better of anybody, if there

05899571-c8b8-4b4f-8366-28018cab2968-1
01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:52.230
is such a thing.

dd0167c6-e4f1-49da-9631-fd8902bc3478-0
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:08.583
Oh, here is another pirate ship
over here on the other side, but

dd0167c6-e4f1-49da-9631-fd8902bc3478-1
01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:12.290
those people aren't seeming to
do anything. I don't know.

ae34f573-3d66-441d-9518-47a90ea79466-0
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:17.200
That's confusing that picture.
OK. #END_being_a_pirate

ffedb774-983b-4abe-ab9c-17fcfca20f1f-0
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.210
OK, shall we go on to the next
picture?

5af6f1b3-42fc-4bdd-96b0-714887ad05ef-0
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:42.930


3fe81eda-e6ba-4050-ad5f-5ca4a0969db9-0
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:04.182
#START_exhibit_12 OK, the Great
Portrait exhibition and we're

3fe81eda-e6ba-4050-ad5f-5ca4a0969db9-1
01:03:04.182 --> 01:03:08.235
looking for characters that we
have seen before. That's going

3fe81eda-e6ba-4050-ad5f-5ca4a0969db9-2
01:03:08.235 --> 01:03:09.020
to be tough.

4694a429-462d-441e-9a9d-f8218e0373d0-0
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:17.960
We have several tiers here where
people can be.

2dcb0f53-5c6d-4ac3-adcc-56f76ca28f4d-0
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:21.570
There are some pictures on the
wall.

825ac0f9-8caf-4a61-a328-a298fed5c626-0
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:28.991
Some that have not been hung
yet. Here people are still

825ac0f9-8caf-4a61-a328-a298fed5c626-1
01:03:28.991 --> 01:03:35.768
trying to get to some place on
the wall and people everywhere

825ac0f9-8caf-4a61-a328-a298fed5c626-2
01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:37.190
on all three.

e074f0eb-c438-4faf-a179-be953e0bfad0-0
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:39.150
Floors.

4c3a8b43-41fc-4c13-a3cf-625a76d81e0d-0
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.340
Of this gallery.

7ebed78a-495f-437b-8fad-c205016ac145-0
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:46.980
And people climbing up ladders
to.

5e6d4be8-2fac-43c6-a88e-b1b39de1b83c-0
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:50.180
Further ones.

172b51ba-5fac-48b3-8328-b46c826f9121-0
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.730
Uh, again, it's pretty.

43eb92ad-b592-481d-9098-293f61683d57-0
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.010
confusing. uh, the walls are all
red.

b31ec8cd-1bbf-4a36-85cb-057eeaa593d3-0
01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.650
Kind of bizarre for an exhibit,
but what do I know?

79ad79b5-5918-42a0-911b-31a1ed14e47b-0
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.358
And at least the stairs the
superstructure is white, so you

79ad79b5-5918-42a0-911b-31a1ed14e47b-1
01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:25.380
can at least make that's
definitive.

53320c5a-67b3-4603-b8dd-10e7a98889cb-0
01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:34.230
Otherwise it just seems to be a
giant miasma of people and.

ce76bf05-7e33-41dd-82d6-634650f5fbc3-0
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:36.500
Artwork.

e2ba78f6-5ed2-4f26-b4cc-e0ac3fdc5bf0-0
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:46.760
{Yeah, you don't have to.

98f08200-45ef-46ca-8dbc-a87a1bf38b23-0
01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.674
Tell a story. You can just
describe what you see in the

98f08200-45ef-46ca-8dbc-a87a1bf38b23-1
01:04:51.674 --> 01:04:56.056
picture.} Yeah, well, I I see a
lot of people. There is just a

98f08200-45ef-46ca-8dbc-a87a1bf38b23-2
01:04:56.056 --> 01:04:57.029
mob of people.

5535a345-c84e-4bf9-97dc-5428e3082b4f-0
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.943
That you can't see very much of
anything. And if you've been in

5535a345-c84e-4bf9-97dc-5428e3082b4f-1
01:05:01.943 --> 01:05:05.332
a museum where there are a lot
of people, you can't see any of

5535a345-c84e-4bf9-97dc-5428e3082b4f-2
01:05:05.332 --> 01:05:06.140
the art anyway.

bb9ac079-55fa-4161-88a7-ea2a675266d5-0
01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.760
So that isn't unlikely.

1a4e4b99-a620-4891-bd10-2fdc019b5d45-0
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:19.260
It's so small that it's hard to
tell.

b4d69c00-0a84-4b03-8446-8d6efcb5e1e9-0
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.936
In any individuals I think see
there is somebody here who is

b4d69c00-0a84-4b03-8446-8d6efcb5e1e9-1
01:05:23.936 --> 01:05:25.230
appears to be running.

bd58f350-d0d2-44a1-805a-be595d3baacb-0
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:30.830
But it's hard to tell from any
expression on any faces what

bd58f350-d0d2-44a1-805a-be595d3baacb-1
01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:34.050
people are doing, whether
they're happy, sad.

c672cd10-297b-4f51-b76e-9c08cc464d64-0
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.615
uh whether they're. It's hard to
say why they're there other than

c672cd10-297b-4f51-b76e-9c08cc464d64-1
01:05:39.615 --> 01:05:40.650
just to be there.

7dad2ee0-bb50-4f9a-9963-74647ec4bc3e-0
01:05:47.770 --> 01:06:01.350


60fbfd74-c6ef-4b7c-bf50-78bfacd5c71a-0
01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.810
Makes you want to get away from
it quickly.

d66eafa7-52b5-40d4-b828-3b034758a382-0
01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.480
It makes you want to get away.

2ab61c83-2a70-457a-8114-38ce9741cf2e-0
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:14.410
Yeah.

90299a79-a84f-432c-b60e-5475482303d4-0
01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.822
If there's somebody still over
here hanging in one of the

90299a79-a84f-432c-b60e-5475482303d4-1
01:06:26.822 --> 01:06:27.450
paintings.

cd735851-33cd-49ef-bc1a-283617fd5b3f-0
01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.810
Over here anyway.

3f881f32-4172-4ae1-b077-bc6388da3950-0
01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.910
It seemed to be mostly portraits
on the walls.

45757398-983d-4f5b-88b5-17654c73e843-0
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:49.870
Uh, rather than places. And
somebody looks like a king here,

45757398-983d-4f5b-88b5-17654c73e843-1
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:51.210
and a clown and a.

61a49e16-ff8f-4eb6-8e0f-c0fc4a46f1c0-0
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.030
Uh.

8f8e4fc9-79cf-4aee-8f90-d35a09393d4d-0
01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.020
Rembrandt I see.

288d489d-6630-45a9-a07e-0f4b445f001a-0
01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.820
Uh.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:04.080
Anyway.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.370
There are some people dressed
as.

120499a1-38a3-4644-acde-e445e357ecca-0
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:34.274
And, and from other centuries,
there's some people here wearing

120499a1-38a3-4644-acde-e445e357ecca-1
01:07:34.274 --> 01:07:35.530
bathing trunks.

005bf4f1-c698-4b87-be8d-1d5c5212f7b6-0
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.970
So there's a really flotsam and
jetsam. #END_exhibit_12

23a1c26f-6793-41de-9d3f-834eee68d1a9-0
01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:44.920
OK.

e8a2558f-8c92-4b67-864f-06a2c66302ee-0
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.940
Then we can finish up with one
last one.

071618d3-fd11-454e-9aaa-a1e774725713-0
01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:52.520
Double check.

63a37216-6b43-4efa-be8c-1aaa4e7274f1-0
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.670
So this will be the last one.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.870
You described today.

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:18.910


1d8b6464-9919-4051-bb84-17b74bff732f-0
01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:25.241
So please describe what you see
in detail. #START_wild_west OK

1d8b6464-9919-4051-bb84-17b74bff732f-1
01:08:25.241 --> 01:08:26.570
there this is a.

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:34.460
Lot of pictures of places that
we one might have seen in the

2c7c733a-3b6a-42c5-9886-d93c0f785e45-1
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.710
West, the Wild West as it calls
itself.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:46.649
There's a saloon, there's the
jail, the those seem to be two

90a1ff56-a484-4b4f-88ff-fe1924f1dbf1-1
01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:47.930
fixtures of.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.990
The Wild West.

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:55.840
You went one from one to the
other and a hotel.

01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:58.390
That's.

01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:03.270
The bank. There's always bank
robbers.

46001662-fb81-4f06-b621-35e623bde5cf-0
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:10.086
There is a a horse in the middle
of the street, people walking

46001662-fb81-4f06-b621-35e623bde5cf-1
01:09:10.086 --> 01:09:11.430
through the street.

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:16.030
Dress as Cowboys with cowboy
boots.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.660
Uh, very few women in here.

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:28.340
Here are a bunch of well looked
to be bison.

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:30.910

01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:39.980
There is a general store.

a2f67b48-ec7a-4488-abc9-f93a2796ed1e-0
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.020
But more saloons than anything.

492c25fb-6007-4fb3-b05a-1ae7b8413d2a-0
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.430
Uh, the stable.

bfada548-76de-49b0-a270-02bddc22f19e-0
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.750
Ohh.

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.480
The blacksmith.

cee7eb0e-c24a-46f1-8faa-b22bfde286ca-0
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.820
And here looks like a train.

481b099d-a939-4641-945c-b46684e06b16-0
01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:12.154
Some people arriving in a
Stagecoach here and the train

481b099d-a939-4641-945c-b46684e06b16-1
01:10:12.154 --> 01:10:18.052
and there aren't a lot of horses
in here for some reason. There's

481b099d-a939-4641-945c-b46684e06b16-2
01:10:18.052 --> 01:10:19.839
just one that I see.

ba711838-a7ff-4ce2-922c-58cb1e2d7ca6-0
01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.430
I find kind of odd.

63e723f2-a557-44a7-b726-f7439dc910c3-0
01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:28.929
In the livery stable, there
aren't horses. Well, there's one

63e723f2-a557-44a7-b726-f7439dc910c3-1
01:10:28.929 --> 01:10:33.120
horse over here riding off into
the sunset. That's typical.

ffcde640-9ea3-4478-a27c-28c73f0db16b-0
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:38.500
In the old movies. Ohh. Here's a
horse here at the blacksmith.

Ah.

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:51.799
Kind of an amalgam of what we
used to think of the Wild West

24b31181-1d28-4a48-9db7-ef72e32850e2-1
01:10:51.799 --> 01:10:52.170

Roy Rogers and John Wayne, of
course. And yeah, all those

Here's some people who look very
contemporary, woman carrying a

01:11:16.652 --> 01:11:20.400
handbag and another with a towel
over her arm.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:30.540
Hmm.

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:34.030
Yeah.

d49a3076-fea5-4348-bb72-fa1144f108bb-0
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:36.680
A lot of bright colors.

1cc9a7ac-8a57-4bd8-b0ba-da506128ca94-0
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:49.593
So much action, so much
excitement, that I wonder if the

1cc9a7ac-8a57-4bd8-b0ba-da506128ca94-1
01:11:49.593 --> 01:11:53.976
real Wild West was as bright and
colorful as this. I doubt that.

1cc9a7ac-8a57-4bd8-b0ba-da506128ca94-2
01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:57.415
No, I think the whole Wild West
was a lot of dust.
