00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.910
It's a little low.

b486d323-bbd3-43ff-8793-11fc13cbc19b-0
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.776

can hear you too? Yes. OK,

b486d323-bbd3-43ff-8793-11fc13cbc19b-1
00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:13.010
great. OK, so we'll start with a
complex scene.

8aed70ad-aed0-472f-a95c-ff9879b739d7-0
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.700
This is a reminder. Imagine
you're describing the scene that

8aed70ad-aed0-472f-a95c-ff9879b739d7-1
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.086
someone who cannot see the
picture. Describe what is

8aed70ad-aed0-472f-a95c-ff9879b739d7-2
00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:26.855
happening and what you see and
take between three and five

8aed70ad-aed0-472f-a95c-ff9879b739d7-3
00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:27.429
minutes.

60971027-02d9-4806-9b9d-ecb540a80f9a-0
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.035
OK, so there's this. That
square is Zoom Square is in the

60971027-02d9-4806-9b9d-ecb540a80f9a-1
00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:37.630
middle of the picture again, ohh
yeah, that's asking if it's OK

60971027-02d9-4806-9b9d-ecb540a80f9a-2
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.210
to record so you can.

c38eecb4-060a-4296-99f8-417ba67db14b-0
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.480
It's OK. It moved all the way,
all right.

d0d9cb65-be27-4dcb-a99b-725f13102aa5-0
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.530
a picture of a zoo.

0b209830-b594-4fa0-890a-275051b7615b-0
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.620
In the center of the picture is
an ice cream stand.

f9664839-6405-4874-9e91-b000d02b7df0-0
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.410
There's a lot of people and
animals.

87662adf-5236-4c58-ace1-06a91f1dc03a-0
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.536

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:21.310
polar bears, raccoons and a
tree, zebras and flamingos.

A some kind of exhibit.

45aa52f7-14b1-4aa2-bd82-1f8f1eb0a9b4-0
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.326
Sand almost looks like a castle,
but I don't see any animals in

396ff5cf-7e12-4e2d-8648-98b7e4e7f40b-1
00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:41.740

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.802
There is a rhinoceros that got
loose and people are running

084cd506-1a79-43a1-a81b-ca88326a4155-1
00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:11.134
away from it. It's running
through the zoo, the bottom part

084cd506-1a79-43a1-a81b-ca88326a4155-2
00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:11.990

From above, the rhinoceros
chasing the people and there's a

b94d148c-086d-40a8-9bcb-aecfed6b63a7-1
00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:34.209
several large giraffes. They
middle right of the picture

b94d148c-086d-40a8-9bcb-aecfed6b63a7-2
00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.430

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.612
Below the ice cream stand there
is a hot dog vendor. People are

c35b627a-5981-424e-8aa0-d08c0a4dce27-1
00:02:44.612 --> 00:02:46.010
buying hot dogs.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.238
what else there's just a lot of
people, a lot of people looking

4374cde9-fcf4-46fa-aea2-36d177f136f7-1
00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:56.600
at the animals.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.960
Buying things.

The the one side were there. Ohh
some of the people were looks

fa05b291-bd9d-473c-8461-6dff59e954f9-1
00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:14.619
like to try to get away from the
rhinoceros. They're jumping into

fa05b291-bd9d-473c-8461-6dff59e954f9-2
00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:15.410
the elephant.

Um, there's a Peacock. We're
taking pictures of the Peacock.

f1ae7399-81e6-4647-9f31-93bcd36abf0a-0
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.765
Ohh,
and there's the zookeepers have

f1ae7399-81e6-4647-9f31-93bcd36abf0a-1
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:40.541
a net and they're looking at the
exhibit with no animals in it. I

f1ae7399-81e6-4647-9f31-93bcd36abf0a-2
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.593
guess the rhinoceros was
supposed to be in that exhibit

f1ae7399-81e6-4647-9f31-93bcd36abf0a-3
00:03:44.593 --> 00:03:48.934
where there is nobody there
asking customers what happened,

f1ae7399-81e6-4647-9f31-93bcd36abf0a-4
00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:53.492
and one of the zookeepers has a
net and I guess they're trying

f1ae7399-81e6-4647-9f31-93bcd36abf0a-5
00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:56.170
to find the rhinoceros that
escaped. #END_escape_from_the_zoo 

f785ec88-3421-4984-9270-b5547d2b9817-0
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.100
OK, you're good on time. So we
can go on to the next picture.

affb7667-970f-4293-aea4-d30ea93422ea-0
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.810
So it's also a complex scene.

60e2d584-f0bd-4cbf-b99f-cbdbf10d1e88-0
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.890

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.491
I guess like an art gallery, but
it's really, really crowded.

2882905e-a040-42e0-842d-5034679d6b30-1
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:37.563
There's basically doesn't look
like there's any room. The

2882905e-a040-42e0-842d-5034679d6b30-2
00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:42.198
entire place is completely
filled with people. Yeah,

2882905e-a040-42e0-842d-5034679d6b30-3
00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:47.183
there's a lot of portraits on
the walls. There's several

2882905e-a040-42e0-842d-5034679d6b30-4
00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:52.430
levels, 123 levels with steps,
and there's people carrying.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.870
There's some people on ladders.

fce49816-62a1-44c1-9b66-8d771dee8325-0
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.084
Um, different types of ladders
and scaffolding. There's people

fce49816-62a1-44c1-9b66-8d771dee8325-1
00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:13.430
putting up more photos, more
portraits.

230aab58-dc20-420a-b940-be4eb3bdf41d-0
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.590
Umm.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.730
And then?

7c745d38-428e-4b9f-8afa-d1c3c2c9dd1d-0
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.870
It's.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.400
In the middle there looks like
there's a policeman.

a32e74c6-110c-47e8-baa1-90173ce4aa5f-0
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.369
I don't know what they're doing.
Um, I guess we're trying to get

a32e74c6-110c-47e8-baa1-90173ce4aa5f-1
00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:43.093
control of what's going on,
whatever's going on, and there's

a32e74c6-110c-47e8-baa1-90173ce4aa5f-2
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:48.160
people dressed up in all
different cultural costumes.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.954
Different ones, and then there's
some of them are just dressed up

0d08cf27-1878-4566-8894-2cc4afa3cef9-1
00:05:56.954 --> 00:06:01.090
in different costumes, like
looks like aliens or astronauts.

e65ea787-fb84-4e55-82b9-d52680ec430c-0
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.928
Costumes. Almost everybody looks
like they're dressed up, and

e65ea787-fb84-4e55-82b9-d52680ec430c-1
00:06:06.928 --> 00:06:10.210
some, not all of them. Some
people just have regular.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.149
Clothes on. Some of them have
costumes on, some of them have

7f0e3922-07b3-44a6-9b9d-82114656b7ff-1
00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.670
masks.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.710
Hmm.

6455486f-1f94-4c47-a92d-b8c77b42a05a-0
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.750
Umm.

e522fd43-d08f-4aa7-891e-91cd1de3f5ef-0
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.749
And the portraits are all
different shapes, so there's a

e522fd43-d08f-4aa7-891e-91cd1de3f5ef-1
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:32.043
ovals and squares and rectangles
and some of them look like

e522fd43-d08f-4aa7-891e-91cd1de3f5ef-2
00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:34.690
Windows with portraits in them

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.510
Just.

32fc981f-8a0e-48b0-b0dc-d341c09a2a01-0
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.607
Can't really tell what's going
on, why it's it's almost like a

32fc981f-8a0e-48b0-b0dc-d341c09a2a01-1
00:06:54.607 --> 00:06:58.400
mob full of people, and I don't
know why, but they're doing some

32fc981f-8a0e-48b0-b0dc-d341c09a2a01-2
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.859
people with wheelbarrows.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.860
That's OK then we can go on to
a different picture. OK.

c3e7d4e5-cdc1-47d4-aaa6-8a3930ef3d4d-0
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.588
#START_waldo_1 Ohh, this is a
picture of. It looks like a

c3e7d4e5-cdc1-47d4-aaa6-8a3930ef3d4d-1
00:07:20.588 --> 00:07:27.512
center of a small town. In the
middle is a fountain and there

c3e7d4e5-cdc1-47d4-aaa6-8a3930ef3d4d-2

Scuba gear on and inside the

00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:39.540
fountain there's also a statue
of an Archer.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.540
with the bow and arrow.

57ca00b9-360e-4a4b-bd15-50e1fcdf83e4-0
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.880
In the triangles like a triangle
when they're going around the

57ca00b9-360e-4a4b-bd15-50e1fcdf83e4-1
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.760
triangle in different. Cars,
motorcycles, scooters.

a9e47770-8e08-4dbb-a8fb-85fce1486bc5-0
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.900
Um, there's lots of people
walking around.

f0cc53a8-05d7-4c14-af03-3c1ebc4205d9-0
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.660
On the bottom half of the photo,
that looks like some kind of.

56eb6b45-2b64-4b0b-b97a-54d6118c7fec-0
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.490
Market

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.820
People are selling things a lot
of.

24b1f46a-66bd-4ee8-a42a-69937c41e618-0
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:17.753
Like kiosks, tents, all the
Spanish people looking at the

24b1f46a-66bd-4ee8-a42a-69937c41e618-1
00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:22.390
merchandise to the left of that.

d9db70c4-b09e-438d-87c3-c855a18ab861-0
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.240
There is a.

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-0
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.565
Looks like an office building,
and there's a lot of people

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-1
00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:36.574
sitting with wind in windows.
You can see people working at

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-2
00:08:36.574 --> 00:08:41.666
desks, working on computers. In
the office building. There's

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-3
00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:46.842
several window washers, looks
like window washers or building

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-4
00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:51.601
washers with ladders. And then
there's, oh, there's some

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-5
00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:56.109
washers up on the roof and
they're like jousting with

b4fd0e62-8049-42b3-9f97-0bcde16e35f5-6
00:08:56.109 --> 00:08:56.610

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.150
You know mops.

c2e6c700-5a6a-49f8-ad2f-6345a855f464-0
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.290
Um.

ece4086a-a1c7-4398-9c90-cfeccf2e61e1-0
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.950
Uh, the next building

d8bbb8c1-1928-4fa6-8a17-575028dca3b0-0
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.200
Across the street.

2d240459-5e43-40f3-a8d9-fc145ba8ba17-0
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.707
It's hard to tell what kind of
building it is. It's a pink

2d240459-5e43-40f3-a8d9-fc145ba8ba17-1
00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:16.622
building. There's several people
on the roof and it looks like

2d240459-5e43-40f3-a8d9-fc145ba8ba17-2
00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:17.990
they're chasing a dog.

2bf1b853-501c-4c91-80c0-5cf233e2bdb1-0
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.560
And there's some people walking
around the building.

1defab99-7736-495c-93f5-d29550e84761-0
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.083
On the other side of the
triangle, there's another

1defab99-7736-495c-93f5-d29550e84761-1
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:31.460
building with.

cec34d88-46b0-4027-bcaa-38188dd80284-0
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.492
Ornate sign on top of another
triangle. Kind of looks like a

cec34d88-46b0-4027-bcaa-38188dd80284-1
00:09:38.492 --> 00:09:42.710
bank or something, but it
doesn't really say what it is.

c208c35e-904e-4b1b-a012-9330bfcd2fcc-0
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.910
In the street there's a.

ebfe1ef7-c9d6-428e-b335-3ec1f717ed3d-0
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.460
Somebody coming out of the
manhole cover in front of it.

93547aab-0742-45c9-bacf-68f51e37f9f5-0
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.577
And then the the buildings on
the office, the other side of

93547aab-0742-45c9-bacf-68f51e37f9f5-1
00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:03.950
the triangle is there's like 3
buildings to together.

e6c30d93-1227-46e9-8716-b125c3f099f4-0
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.289
Looks like it. Ohh. I guess it
looks like a restaurant with

e6c30d93-1227-46e9-8716-b125c3f099f4-1
00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:13.720
some people sitting outside.

f73b02b0-06fe-457c-a983-e245663b93e5-0
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.830
They're pouring wine.

336e39e5-0044-4635-810e-785650381f3f-0
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.750
In a barbershop.

71fedb99-775b-40d4-ab0f-b90ba19b5c1c-0
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.400
Next to that in a bookshop.

3d83972e-5ee4-4665-b90e-5e41d478520b-0
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.014
In and down the street there is
a police station in a fire

3d83972e-5ee4-4665-b90e-5e41d478520b-1
00:10:28.014 --> 00:10:28.520
station.

78117f6b-c4be-4c38-80b6-7d775294edcb-0
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.251
It's hard to tell
what the rest of the buildings

78117f6b-c4be-4c38-80b6-7d775294edcb-1
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:38.003
are. Maybe a shoe shop? I would
electronics store. People are

78117f6b-c4be-4c38-80b6-7d775294edcb-2
00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:41.210
watching the TV in the window in
an auto body store. #END_waldo_1 

ebf02c5c-efc6-4677-8dce-a940cdf15c42-0
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.940
It's midnight. Yeah. OK,
good.

4b706e57-f7c2-4818-92e3-5ded001ee92c-0
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.810
All right.

61e0ea1d-96f0-4a3c-acc6-7645e8335116-0
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.790
OK, so you're about to see
graphic novels next.

245cddf2-af93-43e0-8c94-7a188367e3ee-0
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.050
There are a series of pictures
that tell us story, and again

245cddf2-af93-43e0-8c94-7a188367e3ee-1
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.889
imagine you're telling the story
that someone who cannot see the

245cddf2-af93-43e0-8c94-7a188367e3ee-2
00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:07.504
pictures describe what you see
and what is happening. So take

245cddf2-af93-43e0-8c94-7a188367e3ee-3
00:11:07.504 --> 00:11:09.440
between 10 to 15 minutes.

985030c2-025a-4279-b427-3bb9c15443f3-0
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.980
And this first one, this first
part has about two slides.

dec00f03-bdd1-4989-85fd-d65aab07435c-0
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.326
As they are like a book, this
one is from left to right, top

dec00f03-bdd1-4989-85fd-d65aab07435c-1
00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:25.850
to bottom, just like you would
with a book.

929f461b-cb4c-41a8-9c40-fdb5964446b2-0
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.280
OK.

87c9cc66-cec0-4a7b-a18b-e51d6d54c243-0
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.520
#START_arrival_3 The pictures
are in black and white.

ae675dd5-1df2-4ef0-9ba4-cffc1b6c0181-0
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.510
Um, there is a.

075883a8-85e7-4836-8d58-8fb435b8c0ae-0
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.695
The boy maybe a teenage boy
holding what looks like a

075883a8-85e7-4836-8d58-8fb435b8c0ae-1
00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:53.150
newspaper and there's strange
writing on the paper. And then

075883a8-85e7-4836-8d58-8fb435b8c0ae-2
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:59.500
there is a woman holding a cat
to woman. The other woman is

075883a8-85e7-4836-8d58-8fb435b8c0ae-3
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.956
looking at at the woman holding
the cat, and then there is a

075883a8-85e7-4836-8d58-8fb435b8c0ae-4
00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:06.379
man.

1da42e71-7e59-4a3b-9fa5-706a4a832f08-0
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.500
With some kind of machine. Hmm,
smoke coming out of it.

7c6068d5-33d6-4436-90c9-7046c77a3b93-0
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.992
And some kind of lizard
creature, and then a man and a

7c6068d5-33d6-4436-90c9-7046c77a3b93-1
00:12:18.992 --> 00:12:22.050

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.396
crate. It's 4 eggs and they're
putting them. I don't know if

ac89bd18-11a0-40ee-97ec-d9335b4079f4-1
00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:30.245
they're putting them in the
crate or taking them out of the

ac89bd18-11a0-40ee-97ec-d9335b4079f4-2
00:12:30.245 --> 00:12:30.530
crate.

88bcf3ff-b15a-4a71-97af-6da81bafdf5e-0
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.520
The next photo is.

7a14f727-8c86-4d9d-ac39-a5feba7347c7-0
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.560
A man getting shaved.

24487745-0027-4137-9ac4-f4d9722c51a8-0
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.890
A little boy standing next to
him.

89f3d394-f1f2-43c5-ac5a-9122553fc154-0
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.107
Some kind of snail like
creatures walking down the

89f3d394-f1f2-43c5-ac5a-9122553fc154-1
00:12:47.107 --> 00:12:52.436
street and the next picture is 2
musicians, ones playing a some

89f3d394-f1f2-43c5-ac5a-9122553fc154-2
00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:57.350
type of accordion and the other
ones are playing a violin.

f49837eb-dffd-43a3-b0d4-3397cc76a874-0
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.058
And then there's a picture. It
looks like all this is going on

f49837eb-dffd-43a3-b0d4-3397cc76a874-1
00:13:03.058 --> 00:13:06.490

of several woman.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.121
Looks like she's reading. One
looks like she's knitting and

31204957-ee98-4555-87e4-7ed5750dbcfe-1
00:13:12.121 --> 00:13:15.833
one's holding up some kind of
rabbit type creature and then

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:19.668
there's two more women and then
there's a man standing in the

31204957-ee98-4555-87e4-7ed5750dbcfe-3
00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:23.379
street and he looks confused and
he's holding the suitcase.

696faeec-5034-4dab-a31d-97d61d67ff82-0
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.660
OK, the man.

1b3bbfae-528b-4340-9648-dc81ad1b8c39-0
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.769
Is looking at his stopwatch and
then he's looking up and then

1b3bbfae-528b-4340-9648-dc81ad1b8c39-1
00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:36.760
he's looking at.

e22c9d7b-a052-4a4a-90b9-251b76e23ddd-0
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.324
A building with a clock on it.
And then he's walking down the

e22c9d7b-a052-4a4a-90b9-251b76e23ddd-1
00:13:42.324 --> 00:13:46.126
street with his suitcase and
he's kind of looking around and

e22c9d7b-a052-4a4a-90b9-251b76e23ddd-2
00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:48.620
he keeps walking and then
there's like.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.050
Sparkly white lights.

82589283-023f-4802-95b9-edd78e6aef78-0
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.810
Floating in the ear and he looks
up at them and he tries to touch

82589283-023f-4802-95b9-edd78e6aef78-1
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.619
one because it looks like it
gets bigger and then it looks

82589283-023f-4802-95b9-edd78e6aef78-2
00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:05.249
like the lights are.

5c5a2553-5275-4589-9271-a7e95393fc3d-0
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.167
It's moving in his hat, or like
there's wind and his hat blows

5c5a2553-5275-4589-9271-a7e95393fc3d-1
00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:16.462
off. Hat falls on the ground
with some strange. The ground

5c5a2553-5275-4589-9271-a7e95393fc3d-2
00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:20.467
has some strange directional
writing on it with arrows

5c5a2553-5275-4589-9271-a7e95393fc3d-3
00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:24.981
pointing and he said man picks
up his hat and puts it back on

5c5a2553-5275-4589-9271-a7e95393fc3d-4
00:14:24.981 --> 00:14:28.039
and he's looking at these arrow

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.113
Um, he kneels down by his
suitcase and he's looking at a

6100b1cf-cf27-4bfe-9771-7de50dae977a-1
00:14:35.113 --> 00:14:40.020
book. The book has this strange
writing in it. And then

cd3794f1-8157-432e-8787-0298d36d4419-0
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.556
A hand shows up in the picture
and kind of like taps him on the

cd3794f1-8157-432e-8787-0298d36d4419-1
00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:47.770
shoulder and man looks up at
him.

51a27fb2-9f33-4970-a285-6ea84aa0a6a7-0
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.760
the man

72c33c7e-607a-4de6-ac48-051d115506a6-0
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.891
Looks like like he has a like an
Indian or Arabian outfit on

72c33c7e-607a-4de6-ac48-051d115506a6-1
00:14:58.891 --> 00:15:04.753
white turban on his head and
white clothes and he's puts out

72c33c7e-607a-4de6-ac48-051d115506a6-2
00:15:04.753 --> 00:15:10.518
his hand in the man's talking to
the man with the suitcases

72c33c7e-607a-4de6-ac48-051d115506a6-3
00:15:10.518 --> 00:15:11.960
talking to him.

550c3168-807c-4630-9fe8-f214601d4063-0
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.026
Can't see the whole picture on
the other one zoom but me and

550c3168-807c-4630-9fe8-f214601d4063-1
00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:23.714
showing them something. They
looked at the book and the man

550c3168-807c-4630-9fe8-f214601d4063-2
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:25.980
draws a bed and points to it.

a5a1912a-1618-4fbc-8305-16acb0907463-0
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:27.970
And.

cdec3469-2d19-4524-8a3b-871afa7d37e0-0
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.674
The man with the turban on his
head seems to know what he

cdec3469-2d19-4524-8a3b-871afa7d37e0-1
00:15:34.674 --> 00:15:39.434

00:15:39.434 --> 00:15:44.362
the suitcase starts following
him and the the man with the

cdec3469-2d19-4524-8a3b-871afa7d37e0-3

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.829
 Like a bat, sort
of like a backpack basket on his

28c8c3f1-0357-4324-812a-ed3361e8d233-1
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:53.850

it. #END_arrival_3

ddfdb356-2951-4979-bb67-0ad95c004f23-0
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.483
Alright, so this is that part
of the story and you were saying

ddfdb356-2951-4979-bb67-0ad95c004f23-1
00:15:59.483 --> 00:16:03.512
that you couldn't see part of
the picture. Is it because yeah,

ddfdb356-2951-4979-bb67-0ad95c004f23-2
00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:04.600
I can see, yeah.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:12.713
You can either you can either
try to use the trackpad to move

90d27490-9160-4df3-8f92-bfdeea316050-1
00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:17.430
my video around or I can stop
the video so.

8a7e00f5-dbd6-4d2f-85d9-06bea846c284-0
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.620
Or maybe I can do this hide?

ff2e10a2-9733-48a7-8c07-e28d8b42ebab-0
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.404
OK, so that's a little bit
better. OK, good, it helps

ff2e10a2-9733-48a7-8c07-e28d8b42ebab-1
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:31.285
picture. OK. OK. So for the next
one, maybe you can try to play

ff2e10a2-9733-48a7-8c07-e28d8b42ebab-2
00:16:31.285 --> 00:16:34.560
around with my video and or I
can also just stop it.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.140
All right, so we're going back
to a complex scene.

b7233f07-5891-4954-b8f4-2149c3071345-0
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.070
#START_wild_west This is.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.670
Ohh OK, there's two.

5fd545af-3b66-427e-959e-82b8086bd167-0
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:56.616
Pages to this scene it's a lot
of buildings that looks like a

5fd545af-3b66-427e-959e-82b8086bd167-1
00:16:56.616 --> 00:17:04.213
like a western town. Most of the
men wearing like cowboy hats and

5fd545af-3b66-427e-959e-82b8086bd167-2
00:17:04.213 --> 00:17:05.710
cowboy boots.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:16.171
There's a couple saloons,
several saloons in both pictures

09e28b49-8878-4963-9956-8595be5bff97-1
00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:21.300
onto saloons and hotels, general
stores and jail.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:30.882
Bank and in the far right there
is a train, the train engine.

b2ebbd88-0b9f-4b49-b581-a1e94e56cdf1-1
00:17:30.882 --> 00:17:31.930
Ohh God.

In the left hand picture.

ecbfac1e-1e11-4ba6-90a6-9ebd7ec0d8f1-0

Ohh.

cd8fd2ed-d783-47ff-932c-75e234bff5a5-0
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.530
It was a gold mine that people
were going in and out of.

ad8ee2ce-94e7-4883-b20e-6051f2b96f07-0
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.700
Um, there's people on the roof
for the hotel.

226df704-6772-41d8-87fe-f4317364f679-0
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.830
People on the roof of the the
saloon.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.429
on the jail there's more people
on the roofs and there's people

20843ab3-1e8a-4c4e-90fb-4dba13723904-1
00:18:08.429 --> 00:18:09.350
down below and.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.120
Or walking up and down the
streets.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.762
And then in the right hand
picture, there's more picture

e3c03969-f81f-4598-9512-100ce913da09-1
00:18:21.762 --> 00:18:26.112
more. People on all of the
roofs. Some people are painting

e3c03969-f81f-4598-9512-100ce913da09-2
00:18:26.112 --> 00:18:30.610
one of the solutions. It looks
like they're painting it red.

3967a3d6-ef7f-4187-8949-ef18ea2b355f-0
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:40.540

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.479
Cowboy riding on horse and he's
waving to the people. The people

89c29ace-912e-45fa-966f-c90c87da5aa0-1
00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:46.390
are watching him.

c671a850-3e3b-402c-a75c-62fcd764a487-0
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:56.997
livery stable with some. I guess
they're putting horseshoes on

c671a850-3e3b-402c-a75c-62fcd764a487-1
00:18:56.997 --> 00:18:58.040
the horses.

c85a2723-0eee-496d-83be-8bf0288639b4-0

There's some more people in the

00:19:11.627 --> 00:19:15.020
looks like it's a they're doing
a movie sheet type of thing.

440acfbb-6f87-49c0-955b-5f933ba83741-0
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.310

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:35.226
Not sure what they're doing with
the train, like there's a kind

9fdec598-41b4-4a9f-8c55-2d70d51f69a6-1

Can't remember what they're
called. Like a wagon.

2d79f965-9b28-4627-89db-1605a3228c61-0
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.200
Not a wagon or coach. A coach
stuck on the train tracks.

e99a1286-9c21-467e-af63-be1bad198f1d-0
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.330

Almost Castle rock type
buildings.

flocks, it looks like the town
is on some type of water.

51d13697-4291-417a-a692-f94a1ae60db4-2
00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:48.411
There's a boat in the water with
some people in it and then up on

51d13697-4291-417a-a692-f94a1ae60db4-3

d0c6d330-6c10-424a-b220-6fdaae28c109-1
00:21:11.744 --> 00:21:16.509
Then there's a picture of two
men being with a hat on and

d0c6d330-6c10-424a-b220-6fdaae28c109-2

boy going up a set of steps.

d0c6d330-6c10-424a-b220-6fdaae28c109-5
00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:34.909

The boy gives the basket to a
woman and then the man with the

They're fighting with each

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.580
They have Shields and swords.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.217
Carriages being pulled by
horses. And then there's lions.

8e1b05e6-9ca2-4ab5-832a-16b445aa8bd7-1
00:35:40.217 --> 00:35:43.610
In the arena there's a couple
lions.

47b2265d-b7af-47df-93eb-f915d3ed2ab6-0

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:15.310
Let's see. I guess a lot of the
gladiators are just fighting

99f4c040-e57d-411d-8eb7-57438d324a92-1
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.771

Oh, and then there's some type

6e83e464-8d02-4389-81bd-1c0a868642fe-1
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:56.355
an archway going farther into
the castle and the guards are

6e83e464-8d02-4389-81bd-1c0a868642fe-2
00:43:56.355 --> 00:43:57.750
with him on the boat.

74ce3ef9-3f55-4eed-ab18-49977a38f35e-0
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:03.660
OK.

deca9053-f0bd-42ed-94b1-5a9b42f290e1-0
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.653
On either side of the castle
there looks like there's a a

deca9053-f0bd-42ed-94b1-5a9b42f290e1-1
00:44:10.653 --> 00:44:15.778
bridge like a drawbridge, and
there's looks like a guard on

deca9053-f0bd-42ed-94b1-5a9b42f290e1-2
00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:21.329
it. Guards on top of the bridge
and there's the castle is has is

deca9053-f0bd-42ed-94b1-5a9b42f290e1-3
00:44:21.329 --> 00:44:22.440
more on fire.

b6786301-fb4e-4f01-b2c6-c118571eab79-0
00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.345
Fire is getting worse and the
the boy and girl are looking at

b6786301-fb4e-4f01-b2c6-c118571eab79-1
00:44:27.345 --> 00:44:31.482
the map with the circles at the
on that sitting on that rock

b6786301-fb4e-4f01-b2c6-c118571eab79-2
00:44:31.482 --> 00:44:35.823
that the wizard gave them. The
piece on the piece of paper with

b6786301-fb4e-4f01-b2c6-c118571eab79-3
00:44:35.823 --> 00:44:39.893
the circles and the boat is
going farther away, like out to

b6786301-fb4e-4f01-b2c6-c118571eab79-4
00:44:39.893 --> 00:44:44.166
sea with the wizard on it and
the two guards. And then there's

b6786301-fb4e-4f01-b2c6-c118571eab79-5
00:44:44.166 --> 00:44:46.540
a close up of this piece of
paper.

04880e82-6ab0-40ee-9ac7-16d65d8c8e92-0
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:53.368
that the Wizard gave them and it
looks like a map, and each

04880e82-6ab0-40ee-9ac7-16d65d8c8e92-1
00:44:53.368 --> 00:44:59.943
circle there's six circles has a
different picture on it. There's

04880e82-6ab0-40ee-9ac7-16d65d8c8e92-2
00:44:59.943 --> 00:45:05.523
pictures of like a sea, castle,
tree, the palm tree and

04880e82-6ab0-40ee-9ac7-16d65d8c8e92-3
00:45:05.523 --> 00:45:06.420
mountain.

9523819c-a490-4044-8ea2-af39ab3f2836-0
00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:17.993
OK, so the boy and girl are
still sitting standing on the

9523819c-a490-4044-8ea2-af39ab3f2836-1
00:45:17.993 --> 00:45:18.460
rock.

58517937-d9d9-44c4-be13-579e13650ac5-0
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:25.393
Holding the map in the purple
birds flying above them and down

58517937-d9d9-44c4-be13-579e13650ac5-1
00:45:25.393 --> 00:45:28.710
this river type Moat comes
several.

872a3fe1-46c7-47f3-b8e1-622113055ce5-0
00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:35.366
Ships looks like small Viking
type ships and there's guards on

872a3fe1-46c7-47f3-b8e1-622113055ce5-1
00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:40.863
them. Most of the guards are in
silver armor, but there's one

872a3fe1-46c7-47f3-b8e1-622113055ce5-2
00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:46.094
person in yellow in the guard
standing next to the persons

872a3fe1-46c7-47f3-b8e1-622113055ce5-3
00:45:46.094 --> 00:45:49.729
holding a yellow looks like a
bird cage.

acb6dfe3-b9a9-4959-8422-f6a1a656f5da-0
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.507
So the boy and the girl standing
on the rock get their red and

acb6dfe3-b9a9-4959-8422-f6a1a656f5da-1
00:45:57.507 --> 00:45:59.960
purple crayons. And the girl.

1f618bea-d148-4fd7-8484-44a10518ac0a-0
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.360
Draws a red.

0d0d9657-a6f5-4476-8504-81991e2eaff1-0
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.650
Red flippers on her feet and I
guess red.

235c0dd8-73a1-4524-947f-40bf01677f03-0
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.762
Scuba diving equipment helmet
and the boy in purple draws ohh.

235c0dd8-73a1-4524-947f-40bf01677f03-1
00:46:15.762 --> 00:46:20.680
He has red flippers on too, but
he draws it looks like 

e822e456-4981-403c-94eb-580121db269c-0
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:26.252
Tentacles, some type of octopus
type creature and then the boy

e822e456-4981-403c-94eb-580121db269c-1
00:46:26.252 --> 00:46:30.798
and girl dive into the water and
all you can see is the red

e822e456-4981-403c-94eb-580121db269c-2
00:46:30.798 --> 00:46:32.920
flippers up above the water.

a51ed663-4a98-4eb6-a668-55fe6172f07b-0
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:42.050
OK um, the boy and girl swimming
with the red helmets and red

a51ed663-4a98-4eb6-a668-55fe6172f07b-1
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:46.240
oxygen tanks and flippers under
the water.

fa642a67-3192-47dc-b15b-fa4d4ef16131-0
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:53.090
and the Purple Bird has a little
red oxygen tank one. Also, he's

fa642a67-3192-47dc-b15b-fa4d4ef16131-1
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:58.174
swimming under the water and
they're following the off the

fa642a67-3192-47dc-b15b-fa4d4ef16131-2
00:46:58.174 --> 00:47:01.880
purple octopus that the boy grew
and they.

b5dcc704-0d10-4db5-9d45-5318835ce6e2-0
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:07.100
Um, for being led to some type
of.

5597de88-0537-4ed9-b157-346b738c1cfd-0
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.067
Hard to tell what it is under
the water. Some kind of like

5597de88-0537-4ed9-b157-346b738c1cfd-1
00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.270
Atlantis type?

f6cadd38-0819-49e9-90d4-700673c33d69-0
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:25.084
Building and in the middle of it
is a like a Parthenon type thing

f6cadd38-0819-49e9-90d4-700673c33d69-1
00:47:25.084 --> 00:47:29.320
and it's yellow and glow glowing
yellow is gold.

b0f6f16c-b95a-4501-89f7-2ec80df19518-0
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:39.279
OK, so the boy and the girl in
the purple bird swim over into

b0f6f16c-b95a-4501-89f7-2ec80df19518-1
00:47:39.279 --> 00:47:44.616
this Parthenon type building
with columns, and some of the

b0f6f16c-b95a-4501-89f7-2ec80df19518-2
00:47:44.616 --> 00:47:49.139
columns are like broken in the
middle. There's a.

9be30564-1305-4340-8f65-41d05f0a1f1e-0
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:55.348
Almost like a fountain type
thing and it has seahorses all

9be30564-1305-4340-8f65-41d05f0a1f1e-1
00:47:55.348 --> 00:48:00.350
around it. It's a column on the
top is like a seashell.

4a632d6f-b8c4-4b70-a6ee-86f4a41c3e82-0
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.450
And.

0b0e9005-885b-435b-8ea0-dc1593343e96-0
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:09.126
The boys holding the map that
the wizard gave the girl looks

0b0e9005-885b-435b-8ea0-dc1593343e96-1
00:48:09.126 --> 00:48:13.858
like she's holding ohh she's
picks up a yellow crayon, yellow

0b0e9005-885b-435b-8ea0-dc1593343e96-2
00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:15.080
type crayon and.

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-0
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:19.711
The boy and girl start swimming
away in the purple bird,

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-1
00:48:19.711 --> 00:48:24.024
swimming away holding on to the
octopus. Plus the girl puts the

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-2
00:48:24.024 --> 00:48:28.336
yellow crayon into this belt she
has that's holding all all the

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-3
00:48:28.336 --> 00:48:32.582
crayons. So now she has a red
one and orange 1, yellow one and

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-4
00:48:32.582 --> 00:48:36.962
the boy's purple one. And guards
start swimming after them, with

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-5
00:48:36.962 --> 00:48:41.343
the Yellow Guard leading the way
with the Spears and pointing at

93dd8c89-e1cb-4182-a74e-486eb0719489-6
00:48:41.343 --> 00:48:41.680
them.

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-0
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.476
So the boy and girl make it back
to land, they get out of the

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-1
00:48:50.476 --> 00:48:54.850
water and they look like they're
on some type of like an island

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-2
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:59.087
type setting with palm, lots of
palm trees, and they pull out

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-3
00:48:59.087 --> 00:49:02.914
the red and purple crayons again
and they start drawing

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-4
00:49:02.914 --> 00:49:06.672
something. It looks like the
boys drawing some type of

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-5
00:49:06.672 --> 00:49:10.978
possibly an animal and the girl
looks like she's on top of the

558c54a7-f168-4d55-8307-546bca4762d4-6
00:49:10.978 --> 00:49:13.370
animal she's drawing some type
of.

13a49f76-22c2-4fff-b3d8-a3cf1fda381c-0
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.896
Saddle I don't. Maybe, but it's
hard to tell what they're what

13a49f76-22c2-4fff-b3d8-a3cf1fda381c-1
00:49:16.896 --> 00:49:17.990
they're drawing yet.

4ec51c29-3aa9-43f2-adc7-e0424b1945ee-0
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:27.533
OK, so they drew a purple
rhinoceros with a red saddle

4ec51c29-3aa9-43f2-adc7-e0424b1945ee-1
00:49:27.533 --> 00:49:35.154
like a a rug type saddle with a
with a canopy above it, and it

4ec51c29-3aa9-43f2-adc7-e0424b1945ee-2
00:49:35.154 --> 00:49:42.776
looks like they're sitting on
the rhinoceros. He's taking them

4ec51c29-3aa9-43f2-adc7-e0424b1945ee-3
00:49:42.776 --> 00:49:44.469
to a pyramids.

0d70c928-771d-48f2-8e7b-7463206f8455-0
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.588
And there's statues guarding the
pyramids, the purple birds

0d70c928-771d-48f2-8e7b-7463206f8455-1
00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:52.110
flying in above them.

c9dc3571-79d3-4b85-af04-e3762e69f9f2-0
00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.840
And then there is a photo of the
island.

1fcf7d5e-a57c-4c7b-a5e0-0b8154cdf2f0-0
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.441
looks very much like an island
with palm trees and some of the

1fcf7d5e-a57c-4c7b-a5e0-0b8154cdf2f0-1
00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:06.870
pyramids. And there is a.

9756f0e3-e423-45f5-9401-3d5bb21f637b-0
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:14.534
Like rope bridge, suspension
bridge from the Cliff over to

9756f0e3-e423-45f5-9401-3d5bb21f637b-1
00:50:14.534 --> 00:50:15.410
another.

cc9780a6-9d04-4c4a-9e14-470f0bbfaadb-0
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.290
Pyramid type structure that's
out into the water.

97f21fb5-6c12-41d9-8b49-9b50b6014695-0
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:27.961
OK, so the boy and girl start
going over the suspension bridge

97f21fb5-6c12-41d9-8b49-9b50b6014695-1
00:50:27.961 --> 00:50:31.868
towards this pyramid that's out
in the water and the birds

97f21fb5-6c12-41d9-8b49-9b50b6014695-2
00:50:31.868 --> 00:50:33.060
flying above them.

9f7bc80e-b8ec-40ae-833f-4bae808639a4-0
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.005
And on the very top of this
pyramid structure, there's some

9f7bc80e-b8ec-40ae-833f-4bae808639a4-1
00:50:39.005 --> 00:50:43.430
kind of yellow beacon beacon
flashing like flashing lights.

aea0ed49-7f4b-445d-8ece-87896fdbc649-0
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:52.364
So the boy and girl get to this
peak when they're at the top, at

aea0ed49-7f4b-445d-8ece-87896fdbc649-1
00:50:52.364 --> 00:50:56.160
the very top of this pyramid,
with this yellow beacon in.

d9dffeee-a586-4013-b8af-b0ad568e4bbb-0
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:01.671
The scourge or the soldiers
start coming across the

d9dffeee-a586-4013-b8af-b0ad568e4bbb-1
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:06.165
suspension bridge with their
Spears still chasing them and

d9dffeee-a586-4013-b8af-b0ad568e4bbb-2
00:51:06.165 --> 00:51:09.060
the purple bird is flying above
them.

968a5741-6e4c-456e-834c-3460cb9ca9f6-0
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.400
So then the boy starts drawing
some type of.

1a783c1e-e0ce-4fa4-9834-0ce1ecd37281-0
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.880
Um.

b9ee436a-c767-4937-ae18-74fa54a3bf84-0
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:22.520

00:58:55.778 --> 00:58:56.450
like a.

d15d7d7b-545a-4272-b35f-a9a113baf19d-0
00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.500
It's a sketchpad drawing
something, and there's a red.

c9ec4c9f-2fc0-4d81-8fcd-5d32bba67934-0
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:05.380
Kite coming into the room.

c3118ed3-0e6d-4d9f-a85f-9af28b870c36-0
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.250
And on the bottom floor.

38cc6348-11aa-4382-ab95-fb653d917fed-0
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:14.644
Is the little girl now she has
her yellow crown on holding

38cc6348-11aa-4382-ab95-fb653d917fed-1
00:59:14.644 --> 00:59:17.610
something red. Looks like a ball
and.

7823c170-37a3-46ca-96c5-d7c16c93e883-0
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:26.540
She's drawing a red door on the
wall in the first floor.

2d414349-735e-4122-b61e-bb2088304a28-0
00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:35.769
OK, so the man is sitting at the
sketch pad. He turns around and

2d414349-735e-4122-b61e-bb2088304a28-1
00:59:35.769 --> 00:59:38.530
sees the red kite on the floor.

c364f511-d317-43a1-a0fb-20c985419bb3-0
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:44.609
He bends over and picks up the
kite, and then the next picture

c364f511-d317-43a1-a0fb-20c985419bb3-1
00:59:44.609 --> 00:59:45.290
is he's.

601f3b27-7601-4a96-a651-ac2be5c4c3e4-0
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:50.051
He's gone. He's not at the
sketchpad anymore and the kite

601f3b27-7601-4a96-a651-ac2be5c4c3e4-1
00:59:50.051 --> 00:59:53.040
is on the ground. And then the
next photo.

b455ee8a-df41-4ce2-88c4-8518079bb6be-0
00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:58.479
He got went into the room where
the little girl had drawn the

b455ee8a-df41-4ce2-88c4-8518079bb6be-1
00:59:58.479 --> 01:00:01.440
red door and he's peeking inside
the door.

0b56afc3-2659-40a4-9886-7d7ccdfd8080-0
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:10.991
He goes inside the door and it
comes out into a forest with

0b56afc3-2659-40a4-9886-7d7ccdfd8080-1
01:00:10.991 --> 01:00:11.740
yellow.

89bd0f44-bd69-4d27-b2f2-9c465132dd1c-0
01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.530
Golden lit lanterns all hanging
from the trees, and there is a

89bd0f44-bd69-4d27-b2f2-9c465132dd1c-1
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:21.824
some kind of Creek or small
river running through the

89bd0f44-bd69-4d27-b2f2-9c465132dd1c-2
01:00:21.824 --> 01:00:26.595
forest. On the dock is of the
red ball that the little girl

89bd0f44-bd69-4d27-b2f2-9c465132dd1c-3
01:00:26.595 --> 01:00:27.550
was holding.

3527dc42-3df8-4604-b557-c75e67871046-0
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:36.726
So the man picks up the ball and
then coming down this Creek is a

3527dc42-3df8-4604-b557-c75e67871046-1
01:00:36.726 --> 01:00:42.730
Viking looking boat. It doesn't
seem like there's anybody in it.

974e23f9-6848-4165-a6df-2ba00eb959ee-0
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.370
Um.

91949e7f-6097-458d-aa8a-7deb4770f29b-0
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.580
It floats past the dock and the
man's holding the ball and he

91949e7f-6097-458d-aa8a-7deb4770f29b-1
01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:55.200
gets into the boat while he's
holding the ball, the red ball.

a0e8df2a-7345-4c5e-9a7f-438ba7d77940-0
01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:04.648
OK, another man is floating down
this river in this Viking

a0e8df2a-7345-4c5e-9a7f-438ba7d77940-1
01:01:04.648 --> 01:01:07.580
looking boat machine and he.

6a76a904-4761-4ac3-a06c-c5e63fab840f-0
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.170
Floats down past the castle.

4d92e5ee-9c65-4be4-93a7-ed06eef24468-0
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.230
And.

a661089d-7b1a-4c3b-9657-09ff82846fe5-0
01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:21.136
Up above on the drawbridge is
somebody in a looks like some

a661089d-7b1a-4c3b-9657-09ff82846fe5-1
01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:25.622
type of red, like some type of
little red boat, and they're

a661089d-7b1a-4c3b-9657-09ff82846fe5-2
01:01:25.622 --> 01:01:28.240
heavy, has have a yellow crown
on.

212f6f81-8fca-41bc-9735-322358f6444a-0
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:38.144
The man jumps off the Viking
type boat and he leaves the ball

212f6f81-8fca-41bc-9735-322358f6444a-1
01:01:38.144 --> 01:01:40.980
on the boat and he jumps onto
the dock.

957f7508-d8f3-45d6-91b7-aa5441f96523-0
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:46.582
And he waves, and the little boy
and little girl with their

957f7508-d8f3-45d6-91b7-aa5441f96523-1
01:01:46.582 --> 01:01:51.268
crowns on or or standing on the
steps of the dock. And the king

957f7508-d8f3-45d6-91b7-aa5441f96523-2
01:01:51.268 --> 01:01:55.368
is standing there, and the
purple bird is is there. And

957f7508-d8f3-45d6-91b7-aa5441f96523-3
01:01:55.368 --> 01:01:56.320
then the man.

c162d0d9-b578-43f8-ac05-5fa8a978367f-0
01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:58.820
Walks with them.

9e6a7369-5f15-4960-a69e-fd4572444b4d-0
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.999
In the king and the way or
looking at the little girl and

9e6a7369-5f15-4960-a69e-fd4572444b4d-1
01:02:07.999 --> 01:02:09.020
there's a.

659b99e0-6a76-4f6f-9d09-5bae81e8e13e-0
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.100
a chair 

e829525d-b406-4667-b718-6dedcf54d1cd-0
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:18.904
And the little boy turns like
she doesn't want to go back. And

e829525d-b406-4667-b718-6dedcf54d1cd-1
01:02:18.904 --> 01:02:23.995
the boy and the man and the king
all look upset. They're shocked

e829525d-b406-4667-b718-6dedcf54d1cd-2
01:02:23.995 --> 01:02:24.700
or upset.

74c43b79-24e9-44c5-b36a-3f397f5e5858-0
01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.190
Uh.

2f30f98d-5d32-428a-a0de-665208ccccec-0
01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:37.283
So while they're all the the man
the little boy, little girl in

2f30f98d-5d32-428a-a0de-665208ccccec-1
01:02:37.283 --> 01:02:42.298
the king are all standing there,
somebody comes on another one of

2f30f98d-5d32-428a-a0de-665208ccccec-2
01:02:42.298 --> 01:02:45.869
these Viking looking boats comes
off the boat.

2450989b-6c6e-46d7-a770-8d4f2411a7ec-0
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.635
And then they start coming up
the steps and they're and

2450989b-6c6e-46d7-a770-8d4f2411a7ec-1
01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:56.170
there's the guards with the the
Spears, and they're pointing.

7438569a-840e-44c8-8956-d3b2a1476dda-0
01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:01.161
Towards the king and the boy and
the girl and the the man. And

7438569a-840e-44c8-8956-d3b2a1476dda-1
01:03:01.161 --> 01:03:05.490
the king holds up his hand with
the yellow crayon and it's kind

7438569a-840e-44c8-8956-d3b2a1476dda-2
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.370
of lights up.

570c7321-965c-4c74-af5e-3de0a42d462b-0
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:13.720
So the king starts drawing
something in the air

ae22b8bf-6cbe-48a1-a0f9-12c358311eee-0
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:21.338
And he draws a yellow sword, and
he holds the sword up against

ae22b8bf-6cbe-48a1-a0f9-12c358311eee-1
01:03:21.338 --> 01:03:22.360
the guard.

ad9f41b3-d548-4451-b949-2cc3f81775b2-0
01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.630
And I can't tell the guard has
some kind of box.

45c8e298-76d2-4f85-a49a-2b8bbdfbf07b-0
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.709
Can't tell what it is, and it
looks like he's stealing all the

45c8e298-76d2-4f85-a49a-2b8bbdfbf07b-1
01:03:37.709 --> 01:03:41.184
crayons, all the different
colored crayons, and he runs

45c8e298-76d2-4f85-a49a-2b8bbdfbf07b-2
01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:44.845
away with the box and the
guards. They're holding the king

45c8e298-76d2-4f85-a49a-2b8bbdfbf07b-3
01:03:44.845 --> 01:03:47.390
back so the king can't chase
after them.

acd8ee7e-8745-4792-a686-305ef2714b4a-0
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:57.075
So then the little boy starts
drawing wings with the purple

acd8ee7e-8745-4792-a686-305ef2714b4a-1
01:03:57.075 --> 01:03:59.500
crayon and the man in the.

7685aea4-f5b5-414a-800a-29c99e6e32a5-0
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.540
Girl in the Purple Bird are
standing there while he's

7685aea4-f5b5-414a-800a-29c99e6e32a5-1
01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:09.488
drawing and then he draws some
type of Griffin type creature

7685aea4-f5b5-414a-800a-29c99e6e32a5-2
01:04:09.488 --> 01:04:14.598
with wings and they the man in
the little brown little boy all

7685aea4-f5b5-414a-800a-29c99e6e32a5-3
01:04:14.598 --> 01:04:17.600
get on the griffin type creature
in.

a6093bf7-34f8-4fc7-a4eb-deda642deca6-0
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.932
The creature flies away and the
guy with the box with the

a6093bf7-34f8-4fc7-a4eb-deda642deca6-1
01:04:22.932 --> 01:04:27.216
crayons in it or or trying to
get get them before they fly

a6093bf7-34f8-4fc7-a4eb-deda642deca6-2
01:04:27.216 --> 01:04:27.580
away.

0d9b9640-1726-4b57-aa54-c77db2264b9e-0
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.120
Ohh.

2e17df6c-f4e5-43df-991f-b40d96cc4b8e-0
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.330
So then, um, the king.

2a029cbf-7393-43d5-bd9e-2538843b40cf-0
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:46.864
I guess the guards captured them
and they're in some kind of now

2a029cbf-7393-43d5-bd9e-2538843b40cf-1
01:04:46.864 --> 01:04:50.482
it looks like the Viking type
ship has wings and it's flying

2a029cbf-7393-43d5-bd9e-2538843b40cf-2
01:04:50.482 --> 01:04:53.625
in the air and it's trace
chasing the little boy and

2a029cbf-7393-43d5-bd9e-2538843b40cf-3
01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:57.124
little girl in the me in on the
Griffin up in the air, the

2a029cbf-7393-43d5-bd9e-2538843b40cf-4
01:04:57.124 --> 01:04:57.540
castle.

d57c3b14-3576-417a-809c-3c905adc198d-0
01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.750
Ohh looks like the.

edb38553-44d8-4030-b779-b75d5f38f018-0
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.325
Also, the little boy might have
lost his purple pen. the boy

edb38553-44d8-4030-b779-b75d5f38f018-1
01:05:09.325 --> 01:05:09.940
falls out.

6d6372b1-a486-4147-a3b9-7335cf614481-0
01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:15.480
Yeah, the boy falls out of the
on the next page.

7731b9aa-dd5b-4d0e-8fdb-7d10ce097965-0
01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:20.884
Yeah, he falls out off the
Griffin and the king grabs them.

7731b9aa-dd5b-4d0e-8fdb-7d10ce097965-1
01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:25.487
That's on the. This Viking type
of airship now grabs him by the

7731b9aa-dd5b-4d0e-8fdb-7d10ce097965-2
01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:30.161
hand and then it looks like the
man and the little girl fall off

7731b9aa-dd5b-4d0e-8fdb-7d10ce097965-3
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:34.619
the Griffin and the and the man
grabs the little girl's hand.

83a77773-67a2-47a9-9ff9-5ea85213ec71-0
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.970
Yeah, and then the man and the
little girl.

34c35a4a-ead7-405d-8581-94d560bb12ef-0
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:47.940
In the purple bird like creature
fall into the water. In the

34c35a4a-ead7-405d-8581-94d560bb12ef-1
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:52.140
ocean, there's fish swimming
around under the water and the

34c35a4a-ead7-405d-8581-94d560bb12ef-2
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.990
little girl starts drawing
something with her red pen.

2a088ae0-5508-4a80-b694-4dbe34a6c90f-0
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.080
A red crayon.

5da63799-05a4-49d0-8cab-2b39f0eabc51-0
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:03.780
She draws a submarine.

763d722a-28ca-48f6-afa3-4c4981ddec07-0
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:10.904
So the men and the little girl
in the purple bird are now all

763d722a-28ca-48f6-afa3-4c4981ddec07-1
01:06:10.904 --> 01:06:12.420
inside the submarine.

fbf9e1ba-5d6a-4fec-80ed-4bd10dfe5a16-0
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:18.729
In the water, there's some
telescopes above the water in

fbf9e1ba-5d6a-4fec-80ed-4bd10dfe5a16-1
01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:19.600
the submarine

96ee1080-4267-464d-962a-c2e2d0783374-0
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:28.590
So they float into a cave.

bf84885f-1dad-4993-93ff-698da4c3fc88-0
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.040
and the man, in the little girl,
in the purple bird, or.

390aafc6-7aba-4fd7-84bf-69439fa81776-0
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.661
well the man and the little girl
standing on top of the submarine

390aafc6-7aba-4fd7-84bf-69439fa81776-1
01:06:39.661 --> 01:06:43.310
and they're looking at what
looks like cave drawings. Hmm.

35f5ae25-2269-43d6-89da-d847325fe83d-0
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:55.940
And the little girl points to a
cave drawing.

e0f7a503-6e68-451b-b0b6-4131ab8129d1-0
01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:00.580
Um, it looks like.

a8719f9e-12ba-4c39-b105-023a917f8c64-0
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.635
Two people and one of them's
holding something in their hand,

a8719f9e-12ba-4c39-b105-023a917f8c64-1
01:07:05.635 --> 01:07:09.763
maybe one of those crayons that
light up, and then the other

a8719f9e-12ba-4c39-b105-023a917f8c64-2
01:07:09.763 --> 01:07:13.350
person is might be a woman and
she has some type of.

16370ccb-fde3-45e0-b833-8b09c2e801ec-0
01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.961
Peel or something is point
something out of it in The Cave

16370ccb-fde3-45e0-b833-8b09c2e801ec-1
01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:22.685
drawing and then the second
picture is just a picture of the

16370ccb-fde3-45e0-b833-8b09c2e801ec-2
01:07:22.685 --> 01:07:24.090
The Cave and the water.

ea5daf0e-3cff-46e4-a587-e2843947bed0-0
01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:37.147
So the man and the little girl
looking at all the drawings on

ea5daf0e-3cff-46e4-a587-e2843947bed0-1
01:07:37.147 --> 01:07:41.520
The Cave and they're walking
through The Cave.

b2f3017c-3c98-420e-abd7-dcdb0afdf68d-0
01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:45.749
and coming towards them as a
looks like another one of the

b2f3017c-3c98-420e-abd7-dcdb0afdf68d-1
01:07:45.749 --> 01:07:48.640
Viking boats with the king on it
and the guards.

51cd6227-293a-48ff-a62d-25887dd6ff7e-0
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:55.239
So the man takes the purple
crayon, you know, I guess a

51cd6227-293a-48ff-a62d-25887dd6ff7e-1
01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:59.764
black crayon, and he starts
drawing something on the wall

51cd6227-293a-48ff-a62d-25887dd6ff7e-2
01:07:59.764 --> 01:08:04.601
and it's a looks like a bird
cage with a door or some kind of

51cd6227-293a-48ff-a62d-25887dd6ff7e-3
01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:09.360
frame that's holding the bird
cage. And the purple bird gets

51cd6227-293a-48ff-a62d-25887dd6ff7e-4
01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.340
on in the bird cage on the perch
of the bird cage.

14f88674-f183-4004-ac46-4a4d0d4118fa-0
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.190
So then the guard comes with the
box.

dfd0fbb0-4e47-4412-8f3f-6febb3fbca3c-0
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:28.906
And he's trying to get the bird
from the bird cage and it looks

dfd0fbb0-4e47-4412-8f3f-6febb3fbca3c-1
01:08:28.906 --> 01:08:34.140
like the tail or the purple bird
is going into this box.

4dfe4473-bd70-4a36-996a-f8686499b979-0
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.490
And then he the guard runs up
the ramp of this birdcage.

12bc7350-4cd2-42e9-b32b-3f056c90621a-0
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:51.323
And he gets the the the walls of
the bird cage all folded up and

12bc7350-4cd2-42e9-b32b-3f056c90621a-1
01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:55.610
he's the guard is captured
inside the cage and.

813b9a72-93d9-4778-981c-5b2f72b24124-0
01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.661
The man is holding this box and
there's some purple feathers

813b9a72-93d9-4778-981c-5b2f72b24124-1
01:09:00.661 --> 01:09:01.910
coming out-of-the-box.

43a9cab4-63ae-44a2-87f5-a0fa731d12df-0
01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:13.146
So the man throws the box on the
ground and breaks it open, and

43a9cab4-63ae-44a2-87f5-a0fa731d12df-1
01:09:13.146 --> 01:09:17.100
this bird turns into this large
purple.

20392a73-aa79-4ae5-974f-482577b76bf4-0
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.500
Dragon like creature and there's
all kinds of colors coming out.

cf14a9db-0f0b-4748-8f4b-78974f7ab6cd-0
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.020
Out into the year from the box.

4dfa1ac6-e7d1-4e90-8eda-f9826219673c-0
01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:32.502
Purple, red, yellow, greens,
Blues and the king and the

4dfa1ac6-e7d1-4e90-8eda-f9826219673c-1
01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.640
little boy.

a6fa49dd-e02f-4093-bc57-b9aba8fd30da-0
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.823
Jump off of the Viking boat into
The Cave or running towards

a6fa49dd-e02f-4093-bc57-b9aba8fd30da-1
01:09:39.823 --> 01:09:43.721
them. There's a perfect
butterfly and then the the

a6fa49dd-e02f-4093-bc57-b9aba8fd30da-2
01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:48.537
guards and the silver armor are
like holding their their hands

a6fa49dd-e02f-4093-bc57-b9aba8fd30da-3
01:09:48.537 --> 01:09:49.989
up over their eyes.

32a08932-3189-4aa3-9db2-1b63ad741418-0
01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.340
So the guards.

ae8ee112-0334-4804-a7f0-63dd1eb5e952-0
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:04.452
Float away in the Viking boat
they leave in the man, the

ae8ee112-0334-4804-a7f0-63dd1eb5e952-1
01:10:04.452 --> 01:10:08.280

01:10:19.569 --> 01:10:21.449
is holding the bird cage.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.081
And the little girl hugs the
man, and she still has the red

485ae268-771e-4047-97ea-26cc2cd2f577-1

01:10:33.952 --> 01:10:40.012
the little boy's shoulders, the
purple bird. And then there's a

485ae268-771e-4047-97ea-26cc2cd2f577-3

maybe defend the land from the

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:26.368
This one, if you didn't catch
it, we are at 23 and I told you

d4dcf343-807b-4e31-a85e-3b267ea72a96-1
01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:31.779

01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:41.892
three, 2425 and 26 are all
stories, so they're a bit

d4dcf343-807b-4e31-a85e-3b267ea72a96-4
01:27:41.892 --> 01:27:46.150
longer. We can either do them
now, which will.

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-0
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:51.620
Be a little overtime. You will
probably be 15 to 20 minutes

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-1
01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:55.717
over because there's stories,
but then you don't have to come

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-2
01:27:55.717 --> 01:27:59.550
again. Or we can save all of
them for next time. But that

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-3
01:27:59.550 --> 01:28:03.515
would just be maybe 20 minutes
that you called. Yeah. Well,

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-4
01:28:03.515 --> 01:28:07.083
will they just pay me for
whatever time I'm here, the

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-5
01:28:07.083 --> 01:28:11.048
extra 20 minutes or whatever?
Yeah. OK. So we might as well

f530bede-db6c-48e9-bd5c-35e8ab08d9d6-6
01:28:11.048 --> 01:28:13.889
just stay and get it done. OK.
Sounds OK.

That would be what I do. Just
just. Yeah, as long as I get

01:28:20.101 --> 01:28:24.892

all. Yes, of course. Right.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.910
It looks like the man's walking
down some type of Street

26f4d0c4-d00b-46a4-bb43-d609d749c407-0
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:44.398
and the mouse type creatures
walking behind them and then

26f4d0c4-d00b-46a4-bb43-d609d749c407-1
01:29:44.398 --> 01:29:47.240
there's a picture that looks
like.

1701b27e-ac86-47a6-8dbb-cfbc7306dc75-0
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.428
Some kind of Street almost a
highway and there's some

1701b27e-ac86-47a6-8dbb-cfbc7306dc75-1
01:29:52.428 --> 01:29:57.772
buildings in the background and
cone shaped buildings look like

1701b27e-ac86-47a6-8dbb-cfbc7306dc75-2
01:29:57.772 --> 01:29:58.190
tipis

815d274d-1ca6-42b6-8e81-c683142d6b75-0
01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:06.819
Then there's another picture of
the map and the man holding the

815d274d-1ca6-42b6-8e81-c683142d6b75-1
01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:07.200
map.

fc56ef04-502b-4d3c-884b-f94da55bfcda-0
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:12.627
Looking at the map, trying to
read the map, and then the

fc56ef04-502b-4d3c-884b-f94da55bfcda-1
01:30:12.627 --> 01:30:16.360
there's a farther away picture
of the man standing holding the

fc56ef04-502b-4d3c-884b-f94da55bfcda-2
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.915
map, and the mouse creatures
looking at him, standing below

fc56ef04-502b-4d3c-884b-f94da55bfcda-3
01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:21.100
him, looking at him.

45f9d671-4e14-423c-98e8-ddf0cfde6aaa-0
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.230
Umm.

06164265-bcf2-4c86-8599-5137cbb44ab6-0
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.800
And then there's a a larger
photo.

231cb9d1-1c31-4b18-afff-a8a014dff6cd-0
01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.793
With several people and there's
a lot of the cone tipi looking

231cb9d1-1c31-4b18-afff-a8a014dff6cd-1
01:30:32.793 --> 01:30:37.825
buildings and then there's a
looks like a some type of bridge

231cb9d1-1c31-4b18-afff-a8a014dff6cd-2
01:30:37.825 --> 01:30:40.260
with some kind of ship flying.

3afe6901-ffbb-46e1-9e1a-41dd81686b83-0
01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.510
In the air, but going underneath
the bridge.

72271e0d-06e2-4680-b95a-f967a88dd347-0
01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:48.960
Ohh.

be75312c-4050-42be-a619-530d6b21c2e0-0
01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.701
On the sidewalk or street, it
looks like the mouse creature is

be75312c-4050-42be-a619-530d6b21c2e0-1
01:30:54.701 --> 01:30:57.970
talking to another creature that
looks like a.

8d6349b1-4278-47ff-a9cc-dd663d4cdd0b-0
01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:04.570
Some kind of bird with pointy,
tall, tight pointy ears, long

8d6349b1-4278-47ff-a9cc-dd663d4cdd0b-1
01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:09.039
pointy ears. And the man is
holding the map with the mouse

8d6349b1-4278-47ff-a9cc-dd663d4cdd0b-2
01:31:09.039 --> 01:31:13.735
creature below him, standing
below him, and he's looking at a

8d6349b1-4278-47ff-a9cc-dd663d4cdd0b-3
01:31:13.735 --> 01:31:14.190
woman.

01bb054c-8f20-49e2-843a-f4edb566f6a0-0
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.417
And the bird like creature I
guess, is standing next to the

01bb054c-8f20-49e2-843a-f4edb566f6a0-1
01:31:20.417 --> 01:31:25.550
woman and she's holding a book,
reading a book, and the man says

01bb054c-8f20-49e2-843a-f4edb566f6a0-2
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:30.761
something to the woman, he holds
his hand out and the woman looks

01bb054c-8f20-49e2-843a-f4edb566f6a0-3
01:31:30.761 --> 01:31:31.630
at the map.

14ddb960-26be-4530-a6ad-d2b4aa59bb68-0
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:38.660
And it looks like she's pointing
at something on the map.

e8d5071c-62c3-441c-b8d4-e8dc929112fc-0
01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:46.725
Yeah, and then she's pointing to
a machine is a strange looking

e8d5071c-62c3-441c-b8d4-e8dc929112fc-1
01:31:46.725 --> 01:31:52.810
machine, but it looks like a
telephone. The phone dial on it

e8d5071c-62c3-441c-b8d4-e8dc929112fc-2
01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:53.210
and.

b88cfe44-1a4a-48ab-a0bf-cc4c6b8bd6dc-0
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:59.855
She dials something on the phone
and then pulls a lever and

b88cfe44-1a4a-48ab-a0bf-cc4c6b8bd6dc-1
01:31:59.855 --> 01:32:05.170
something comes out, almost like
it looks like some type of

b88cfe44-1a4a-48ab-a0bf-cc4c6b8bd6dc-2
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:07.120
ticket comes out of a.

2f61e0b8-8287-41d3-9250-7a72c1b55b62-0
01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:12.142
Tube or funnel in the women
points to holds the ticket and

2f61e0b8-8287-41d3-9250-7a72c1b55b62-1
01:32:12.142 --> 01:32:15.610
points to it, and then she hands
it to the man.

719ca69d-d8e1-4103-b0fa-0a9b52a82441-0
01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:24.215
And then the woman, and it's
hard to tell what they're doing.

719ca69d-d8e1-4103-b0fa-0a9b52a82441-1
01:32:24.215 --> 01:32:29.330
They're looking at something and
she's holding up three fingers

719ca69d-d8e1-4103-b0fa-0a9b52a82441-2
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:30.050
and then.

9ae84238-14ac-42d3-b04a-b093c093b7b0-0
01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.470
It's a scene of.

d7cd5325-e985-4bfd-95c0-ef0e385f66ad-0
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:39.314
A bunch of people standing and
looking up at the flying boat

d7cd5325-e985-4bfd-95c0-ef0e385f66ad-1
01:32:39.314 --> 01:32:39.730
type.

c057543f-9837-44de-82ea-e60b3a760f4a-0
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:45.100
Machines flying in the air and
then.

4f52d721-982c-4233-9ea4-37dd4d5cb0b1-0
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:50.479
Some of them are pointing to the
flying machines and they're

4f52d721-982c-4233-9ea4-37dd4d5cb0b1-1
01:32:50.479 --> 01:32:54.097
standing there in the flying
type machine that almost looks

4f52d721-982c-4233-9ea4-37dd4d5cb0b1-2
01:32:54.097 --> 01:32:54.520
like a.

1b03d9a0-b9df-4876-9f77-05efee34af0b-0
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.352
I can't think what it's called.
A sternwheel type of machine.

1b03d9a0-b9df-4876-9f77-05efee34af0b-1
01:33:02.352 --> 01:33:04.810
Looks like it lands on the
ground.

7283e0ec-d9f4-47be-89bd-bc7bec775036-0
01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:12.203
And then the man holding the map
and the mouse type creature are

7283e0ec-d9f4-47be-89bd-bc7bec775036-1
01:33:12.203 --> 01:33:17.136
walking and it looks like
somebody's stamping or

7283e0ec-d9f4-47be-89bd-bc7bec775036-2
01:33:17.136 --> 01:33:23.781
validating the man's ticket. And
then the person is pointing like

7283e0ec-d9f4-47be-89bd-bc7bec775036-3
01:33:23.781 --> 01:33:26.600
showing the man where to go.

19a98f11-1fdf-4eac-b9d4-98247cf70f21-0
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:36.750
So the man gets on, which I'm
assuming is this.

09962915-41f6-48f8-9e52-bb49e20d0cb3-0
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.710
A flying ship.

f3d2f4df-0dd6-4f25-9329-ff2f03320cfa-0
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:47.233
And there's wooden benches. He
sits down on the bench with the

f3d2f4df-0dd6-4f25-9329-ff2f03320cfa-1
01:33:47.233 --> 01:33:52.736
mouse type creature and the
woman, not sure if it's the same

f3d2f4df-0dd6-4f25-9329-ff2f03320cfa-2
01:33:52.736 --> 01:33:58.239
woman with the bird, is also
sitting on the bench talking to

f3d2f4df-0dd6-4f25-9329-ff2f03320cfa-3
01:33:58.239 --> 01:33:58.600
him.

ecc660a3-2fa8-4237-800a-b7ce6431c7e2-0
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.755
and the man is holding up his
arms like he doesn't know

ecc660a3-2fa8-4237-800a-b7ce6431c7e2-1
01:34:04.755 --> 01:34:05.590
something.

55e859f8-2a25-4e29-8cec-1880b2b9e952-0
01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.940
And he's gesturing.

e27520a4-aba4-4dc2-8606-944a77c2adca-0
01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.578
Putting his hand on his chest
and he has one hand out and then

e27520a4-aba4-4dc2-8606-944a77c2adca-1
01:34:14.578 --> 01:34:14.760
he.

8d0d834f-e842-4707-b621-3218764d4b99-0
01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:20.903
Is looking at something or
getting something out of like an

8d0d834f-e842-4707-b621-3218764d4b99-1
01:34:20.903 --> 01:34:25.873
inside coat pocket and he holds
up a piece of paper and on the

8d0d834f-e842-4707-b621-3218764d4b99-2
01:34:25.873 --> 01:34:30.607
paper in the top left corner of
this paper is a photo of it

8d0d834f-e842-4707-b621-3218764d4b99-3
01:34:30.607 --> 01:34:32.579
looks like a little girl.

aa9066b8-2e64-4eb9-a09c-eef4b75f647f-0
01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.120
and the woman.

bcd371bd-4dc4-4d3f-8035-1a20edb1e533-0
01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:41.045
Puts her hand up to her chest or
her heart like she shows concern

bcd371bd-4dc4-4d3f-8035-1a20edb1e533-1
01:34:41.045 --> 01:34:45.320
and then she goes into her bag
and she pulls out her.

bc1465ac-5281-45e5-9c1d-2a2d9115d025-0
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:51.355
Oh, it's hard to. That's a
picture. Her picture. There's a

bc1465ac-5281-45e5-9c1d-2a2d9115d025-1
01:34:51.355 --> 01:34:56.253
picture of a little girl on the
top left hand. The man's picture

bc1465ac-5281-45e5-9c1d-2a2d9115d025-2
01:34:56.253 --> 01:35:01.000
really doesn't show. You can't
tell what the picture is on the

bc1465ac-5281-45e5-9c1d-2a2d9115d025-3
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.239
top left hand side. So and then
there's a.

0b83844e-aa95-4141-944d-1dc6cc1c4541-0
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:08.750
Several small photos on the
other page.

ee2240d9-7003-4e26-a89f-4146412c5ca3-0
01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.162
Looks like a woman or a little
girl holding a book. Reading a

ee2240d9-7003-4e26-a89f-4146412c5ca3-1
01:35:13.162 --> 01:35:13.440
book.

bf7284a2-cf2a-4905-9dac-3cead36876f2-0
01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:19.210
and larger hands, grabbing her
and she looks very scared.

2d7ca640-a5cb-4349-bf67-fd2fdd499109-0
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:27.523
And then there's the larger
hands putting the book inside a

2d7ca640-a5cb-4349-bf67-fd2fdd499109-1
01:35:27.523 --> 01:35:33.500
drawer. And then he's locking
something with a key for and he

2d7ca640-a5cb-4349-bf67-fd2fdd499109-2
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:39.476
he grabs the little girl's arm
and he's holding a shovel, and

2d7ca640-a5cb-4349-bf67-fd2fdd499109-3
01:35:39.476 --> 01:35:41.789
he hands her the shovel.

b5146de8-34ac-4978-8eb6-abe6c07b706a-0
01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:48.726
And points to what looks like
some type of stove with a fire

b5146de8-34ac-4978-8eb6-abe6c07b706a-1
01:35:48.726 --> 01:35:54.690
inside, and the little girl is
shoveling something into this.

fbf504bd-d36a-4a27-af70-493d14d69cdd-0
01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:58.720
Furnace with the fire inside and
it's.

d5e43743-274f-4510-8636-4868922b86c9-0
01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.711
Showing like she's doing it in
the rain, she's doing snow.

d5e43743-274f-4510-8636-4868922b86c9-1
01:36:04.711 --> 01:36:09.380
She's doing it in the heat in
the daytime in the night time

d5e43743-274f-4510-8636-4868922b86c9-2
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:13.505
she climbed Ohh then  smoke
starts coming out of the

d5e43743-274f-4510-8636-4868922b86c9-3
01:36:13.505 --> 01:36:18.563
furnace. She gets a ladder with
a like a chimney brush and she's

d5e43743-274f-4510-8636-4868922b86c9-4
01:36:18.563 --> 01:36:23.699
putting the chimney brush inside
the the chimney of this furnace.

0af767e5-a97b-4b4c-ab63-220faee0a0bf-0
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:31.670
And then there's a picture like.

c6cf29e7-235b-41b6-af24-8d1329eddfe3-0
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:38.343
Ohh dozens and dozens of these
little rooms with Fern, all

c6cf29e7-235b-41b6-af24-8d1329eddfe3-1
01:36:38.343 --> 01:36:43.299
these furnaces in them. And
there's little girls inside each

c6cf29e7-235b-41b6-af24-8d1329eddfe3-2
01:36:43.299 --> 01:36:47.849
room shoveling into these
furnaces and and cleaning the

c6cf29e7-235b-41b6-af24-8d1329eddfe3-3
01:36:47.849 --> 01:36:52.886
furnaces. And the little girl,
once she gets up on top of the

c6cf29e7-235b-41b6-af24-8d1329eddfe3-4
01:36:52.886 --> 01:36:57.761
chimney, I think she's she
realizes there's dozens of these

c6cf29e7-235b-41b6-af24-8d1329eddfe3-5
01:36:57.761 --> 01:37:02.230
people, kids, these little girls
shoveling into these.

ac5e7a7d-dac4-40ec-b586-8aef9a67b376-0
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:07.272
furnaces. So then the next
picture is they're showing her

ac5e7a7d-dac4-40ec-b586-8aef9a67b376-1
01:37:07.272 --> 01:37:12.502
in this what it looks like a
small room sitting on the floor

ac5e7a7d-dac4-40ec-b586-8aef9a67b376-2
01:37:12.502 --> 01:37:16.359
in her bare feet, and she's
crying or upset.

0d800f18-6e31-42ad-b2d7-9bc2973c29e7-0
01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:23.484
And she takes the shovel and
she's looking at the door and

0d800f18-6e31-42ad-b2d7-9bc2973c29e7-1
01:37:23.484 --> 01:37:25.120
she uses the shovel to.

204bf043-490f-4228-aaed-d66b7c626c7a-0
01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:33.054
Open the door, get the door
opened, and she peeks out of the

204bf043-490f-4228-aaed-d66b7c626c7a-1
01:37:33.054 --> 01:37:33.560
door.

e3f74482-7de1-4b7c-add0-d2a8e983b83c-0
01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:41.373
She looks scary. It looks like
she goes outside the door into

e3f74482-7de1-4b7c-add0-d2a8e983b83c-1
01:37:41.373 --> 01:37:46.257
that the drawer, and she gets
her book and then she's running

e3f74482-7de1-4b7c-add0-d2a8e983b83c-2
01:37:46.257 --> 01:37:49.959
with her book and it looks like
she's running.

d8d3edec-c2c8-46bb-86fd-8c907f10b017-0
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:56.641
Outside, let's use escaping. She
climbs through some type of

d8d3edec-c2c8-46bb-86fd-8c907f10b017-1
01:37:56.641 --> 01:38:01.550
window with the book and she's
sitting inside the window or

d8d3edec-c2c8-46bb-86fd-8c907f10b017-2
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.960
door.

c7d787bd-a103-4581-83d9-38aacccbce03-0
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:04.760
Kind of crunched over.

ccac406d-658f-497f-b302-4d45d95ed017-0
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.154
and the books on the floor
beside her and then the next

ccac406d-658f-497f-b302-4d45d95ed017-1
01:38:09.154 --> 01:38:13.418
picture is a picture of a train.
Ohh she must have been. I guess

ccac406d-658f-497f-b302-4d45d95ed017-2
01:38:13.418 --> 01:38:17.290
she was going inside the train.
One of the train cars. OK.

06439188-5d10-4dcd-ac23-c36ae9d330eb-0
01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.690
So she she got into one of these
train cars.

b6057fc4-7664-4c3c-86af-ef179823c9cb-0
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:30.542
So the next picture is a picture
of the city with some billboards

b6057fc4-7664-4c3c-86af-ef179823c9cb-1
01:38:30.542 --> 01:38:31.660

01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.480
Boat.

8e5adb0e-6f9a-4fee-a9a4-596ee4908f49-0
01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.471
Type machine and you can see the
benches with people sitting on

8e5adb0e-6f9a-4fee-a9a4-596ee4908f49-1
01:38:39.471 --> 01:38:43.880
them and the man and the woman
are still sitting on the bench

8e5adb0e-6f9a-4fee-a9a4-596ee4908f49-2
01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:48.503
and they're pointing and then it
looks like some kind of type of

8e5adb0e-6f9a-4fee-a9a4-596ee4908f49-3
01:38:48.503 --> 01:38:52.130
conductor or person is using a
megaphone and then.

f81c8722-4b7f-4d92-b67b-3e61c0ae07ef-0
01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:55.220
It looks like they're lying.
They land.

b649c14a-898b-4499-8794-f26a7cb403df-0
01:38:56.650 --> 01:38:57.480
And.

b989b6ae-1871-4c7e-ba41-e098488944b7-0
01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:03.010
The man and woman shake hands
and the man walks away with his

b989b6ae-1871-4c7e-ba41-e098488944b7-1
01:39:03.010 --> 01:39:07.352
mouse type creature and then
he's looking up and he looks

b989b6ae-1871-4c7e-ba41-e098488944b7-2
01:39:07.352 --> 01:39:12.067
confused and then he looks like
he's in some type of town with

b989b6ae-1871-4c7e-ba41-e098488944b7-3
01:39:12.067 --> 01:39:16.708
steps, and there's a few people
walking up and down the steps

01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.450
Fruit in it.

dc2e1d2e-0440-435f-8c2f-6f7cd787623c-0
01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:36.359
Then the man is walking down the
street with his mouse creature

dc2e1d2e-0440-435f-8c2f-6f7cd787623c-1
01:39:36.359 --> 01:39:39.712

01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:56.869
And then there's another machine

Onion type vegetable and then
the man with the hat.

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-0
01:43:26.690 --> 01:43:30.854
Looks like he's eating the
whatever vegetable was that the

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-1
01:43:30.854 --> 01:43:35.089
man with the glasses cut in half
and then the little boy is

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-2
01:43:35.089 --> 01:43:39.606
feeding the mouse type creature
or some food and then they have

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-3
01:43:39.606 --> 01:43:44.194
a whole basket full of all kinds
of foods that they were eating.

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-4
01:43:44.194 --> 01:43:48.076
The little boy whispered
something to the man with the

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-5
01:43:48.076 --> 01:43:52.382
glasses, and the man with the
glasses are there puts his arm

61252cbb-60cd-46b0-ba2d-0b917d272e17-6
01:43:52.382 --> 01:43:55.770
around the shoulder of the man
of with the hat.

f1b02174-a63a-42fc-95f4-545b2f68a6b8-0
01:43:55.850 --> 01:44:01.535
And the both men are holding
baskets for food and the boy is

f1b02174-a63a-42fc-95f4-545b2f68a6b8-1
01:44:01.535 --> 01:44:07.034
pointing towards a boat. And
then the the both men and the

f1b02174-a63a-42fc-95f4-545b2f68a6b8-2
01:44:07.034 --> 01:44:12.160
little boy walk down to where
all these row boats are.

401806dd-7bde-40d5-9609-7375011777bb-0
01:44:15.730 --> 01:44:19.702
No. So then the little boy takes
a basket with the mouse like

401806dd-7bde-40d5-9609-7375011777bb-1
01:44:19.702 --> 01:44:23.418
creature and they're walking
towards a boat and there's a

401806dd-7bde-40d5-9609-7375011777bb-2
01:44:23.418 --> 01:44:25.340
some kind of pots on the boat.

2397abd8-b8b1-499a-988d-397d5f2d246d-0
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:32.958
Then something's growing out of
the pot. The boy motions over,

2397abd8-b8b1-499a-988d-397d5f2d246d-1
01:44:32.958 --> 01:44:34.970
and the man with the hat.

d6922079-289e-449c-8015-8bac647ea009-0
01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:39.795
Looks in the pot and it's some
type of tail was coming out of

d6922079-289e-449c-8015-8bac647ea009-1
01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:43.721
the pipe and the man with the
hat looks shy and the little

d6922079-289e-449c-8015-8bac647ea009-2
01:44:43.721 --> 01:44:47.913
boys laughing, and then the man
with the glasses puts his hand

d6922079-289e-449c-8015-8bac647ea009-3
01:44:47.913 --> 01:44:52.105
on the shoulder of the man of
with the hat and looks like he's

d6922079-289e-449c-8015-8bac647ea009-4
01:44:52.105 --> 01:44:53.170
reassuring them.

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-0
01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.904
He points over again to whatever
is in the pot, the the man with

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-1
01:45:00.904 --> 01:45:06.088
the glasses pointing for the man
with the hat, the and the little

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-2
01:45:06.088 --> 01:45:10.643
boy takes out a cat like
creature with this tail that was

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-3
01:45:10.643 --> 01:45:15.591
coming out of the pot. And he's
holding this cat like creature

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-4
01:45:15.591 --> 01:45:20.460
with his long tail. And the man
is showing it to the man with

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-5
01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:25.015
the hat and the man with the
glasses is pointing down and

ea59314f-1fac-4b56-913c-8f90eb9e1121-6
01:45:25.015 --> 01:45:25.329
the.

bc426ca3-bfbc-4644-9471-cbbcea528b9e-0
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:28.085
The cat like creature in the
mouse like creature looking at

bc426ca3-bfbc-4644-9471-cbbcea528b9e-1
01:45:28.085 --> 01:45:29.180
each other on the ground.

b991179c-3a0a-452b-a962-eef2dc6abe55-0
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:31.140
Um.

0a22c5fd-7d66-4d28-bc0e-cfeda9b3f8fc-0
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.170
And then?

730ed36a-09ef-478f-bfa0-5c55c57b2b2a-0
01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:39.740
There's hands picking up a bunch
of vegetables from the basket.

86a259c3-896d-4fc7-81ae-9019eff36f46-0
01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:41.770
And.

b7de38cf-bf71-477c-99be-a75fcad20358-0
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:46.660
The man with the hat looks
concerned.

b633ef71-93c6-4f97-8e09-0673d48c03ac-0
01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:51.678
It's hard to tell why, and the
man with the glasses looks like

b633ef71-93c6-4f97-8e09-0673d48c03ac-1
01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:56.155
he's trying to reassure him, and
the man with the hat is looking

b633ef71-93c6-4f97-8e09-0673d48c03ac-2
01:45:56.155 --> 01:45:58.910
up in the sky and holding his
hands up.

abf2d64d-7122-496a-a8d8-cdb793a60995-0
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.460
He takes out his book and he
draws.

9a9067ea-98d8-48b1-b9c4-001c2fa09f4d-0
01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:09.538
Um like 3 houses in a tail and
he holds it up and shows to the

9a9067ea-98d8-48b1-b9c4-001c2fa09f4d-1
01:46:09.538 --> 01:46:12.320
man with glasses and the man

deb96714-281f-43b5-8f1f-5af6fd48226b-0
01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.810
With the glasses puts his hands
on his chest and then he looks

deb96714-281f-43b5-8f1f-5af6fd48226b-1
01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:17.790
up in the sky.

86399c9f-3980-47d8-8ca0-3321e6497c66-0
01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.230
And he's looking at something in
the sky.

c764bd01-e95d-4653-8ba2-19b7a4154df8-0
01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:29.626
And like
reflection from his eye, like,

c764bd01-e95d-4653-8ba2-19b7a4154df8-1
01:46:29.626 --> 01:46:33.827
it's hard to tell what it is,
but it looks like fire or

c764bd01-e95d-4653-8ba2-19b7a4154df8-2
01:46:33.827 --> 01:46:38.479
something that he's looking up
at. #END_arrival_4 OK, so that was this part

c764bd01-e95d-4653-8ba2-19b7a4154df8-3
01:46:38.479 --> 01:46:41.630
of the story. And so we've got
two more.

b6cb98bb-26d1-4170-8608-2de27273536c-0
01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:44.890
Both of them are graphic
novels.

599189c2-e799-4748-b05a-a7a86041a957-0
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:48.610
I'm going to pull them up right
now.

2d4a661b-a62e-4c85-a19b-e43a4e985611-0
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:09.450
One has around 3 slides and the
other one has 11.

272e01a2-5de3-4ed4-9805-35d4c3a519f9-0
01:47:17.150 --> 01:47:17.650
OK.

d0ac0e28-c2d3-47c5-850e-12d030986685-0
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:21.810
OK.

2a8067c0-5bba-4d07-8926-bb34e759cc79-0
01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:29.182
#START_arrival_2 black and white
photos again. First photo is

2a8067c0-5bba-4d07-8926-bb34e759cc79-1
01:47:29.182 --> 01:47:33.806
showing. It looks like three
women sitting on a bench.

2a8067c0-5bba-4d07-8926-bb34e759cc79-2
01:47:33.806 --> 01:47:38.682
There's this, and there's a
child on the floor. They have

2a8067c0-5bba-4d07-8926-bb34e759cc79-3
01:47:38.682 --> 01:47:43.643
scarves on their heads and
there's a suitcase next to them

2a8067c0-5bba-4d07-8926-bb34e759cc79-4
01:47:43.643 --> 01:47:49.023
on the floor. And then there's
three men, caps on, sitting on a

2a8067c0-5bba-4d07-8926-bb34e759cc79-5
01:47:49.023 --> 01:47:53.900
bench, and they have suitcases
and packages on the floor.

e543718f-17d0-4d15-a74f-5df1fd7a4e1a-0
01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.150
And then there's a woman.

a4f63fa0-1034-47c1-a86d-8e903e1ee791-0
01:47:57.870 --> 01:48:01.899
Looks like she's holding she's
holding the package. Or child in

a4f63fa0-1034-47c1-a86d-8e903e1ee791-1
01:48:01.899 --> 01:48:05.740
arms and a man standing behind
her, facing the opposite way.

1f77a74c-b003-44c0-9bf7-c16c51b5b66a-0
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:13.104
Then the man with the hat is
sitting on a bench and he's

1f77a74c-b003-44c0-9bf7-c16c51b5b66a-1
01:48:13.104 --> 01:48:15.880
writing something in his book.

9d6ef34e-9b45-4e69-831d-ec0d94a10a13-0
01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:21.799
And there's a closer up of page
of the book, but you can't tell

9d6ef34e-9b45-4e69-831d-ec0d94a10a13-1
01:48:21.799 --> 01:48:26.454
what he's writing. And then he
ripped the page out of this

9d6ef34e-9b45-4e69-831d-ec0d94a10a13-2
01:48:26.454 --> 01:48:31.425
book, and he folds it over and
he folds it again. And he makes

9d6ef34e-9b45-4e69-831d-ec0d94a10a13-3
01:48:31.425 --> 01:48:36.395
a bird, origami bird out of the
page. And he holds the origami

9d6ef34e-9b45-4e69-831d-ec0d94a10a13-4
01:48:36.395 --> 01:48:41.366
bird up in his fingertips. And
then he looks away, and then he

9d6ef34e-9b45-4e69-831d-ec0d94a10a13-5
01:48:41.366 --> 01:48:43.260
stands up with his book.

96888da0-3d13-440f-9aec-7d113be03cb2-0
01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.564
And then it looks like he's
looking away and he's looking

96888da0-3d13-440f-9aec-7d113be03cb2-1
01:48:49.564 --> 01:48:54.478
farther away. And then he holds
his hand up to shade his eyes,

96888da0-3d13-440f-9aec-7d113be03cb2-2
01:48:54.478 --> 01:48:58.300
and he's looking even farther
away, and there's.

9057fbe9-e776-4bed-a95d-4e85b4992413-0
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:04.161
Several. There's all kinds of
people on some kind of ship, and

9057fbe9-e776-4bed-a95d-4e85b4992413-1
01:49:04.161 --> 01:49:05.380
there's white.

9f786e09-6a00-4a03-bec9-3f39a3831372-0
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:08.600
Birds all flying away.

6736e8d9-ea6e-442b-baa5-fb237f6b150b-0
01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:18.336
Um, so it looks like there's all
kinds of people on the ship, and

6736e8d9-ea6e-442b-baa5-fb237f6b150b-1
01:49:18.336 --> 01:49:22.511
there's steam funnels on the
ship, and it looks like they're

6736e8d9-ea6e-442b-baa5-fb237f6b150b-2
01:49:22.511 --> 01:49:26.480
in some type of harbor with Big
city and skyscrapers, and

6736e8d9-ea6e-442b-baa5-fb237f6b150b-3
01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:30.039
there's birds and flying
machines and there's other

6736e8d9-ea6e-442b-baa5-fb237f6b150b-4
01:49:30.039 --> 01:49:30.450
ships.

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-0
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:36.152
Uh, smaller ships, large ships,
sailboats and all the people are

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-1
01:49:36.152 --> 01:49:40.367
on deck looking out into the
city and then they pass a

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-2
01:49:40.367 --> 01:49:45.273
steamship and there's two giant
statues that looks like they're

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-3
01:49:45.273 --> 01:49:50.025
floating in the water on boats
and they're shaking hands. And

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-4
01:49:50.025 --> 01:49:55.008
one two men. One of the men has
a mouse like creature and one of

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-5
01:49:55.008 --> 01:49:59.147
the men has a a bird like
creature and then they have

88bea46e-91ad-429a-a2e4-def8bca44fd3-6
01:49:59.147 --> 01:50:01.140
different things in their.

78c42330-de1a-458e-ae41-2c28cd3472c5-0
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:07.140
Their boats, pots and suitcases
and baskets and teacup and

78c42330-de1a-458e-ae41-2c28cd3472c5-1
01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:07.830
teapot.

d046765e-c0b3-489a-b3ac-e6e479a89c0d-0
01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:17.634
So then there's a picture of the
large ship with the people on

d046765e-c0b3-489a-b3ac-e6e479a89c0d-1
01:50:17.634 --> 01:50:21.557
it. It's the farther away
picture. You could barely see

d046765e-c0b3-489a-b3ac-e6e479a89c0d-2
01:50:21.557 --> 01:50:23.660
the people on it the the boat.

c77fafc4-3553-4a04-a3c2-d0baa7c7439b-0
01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:28.829
It's looking out and then there
is a picture of the people

c77fafc4-3553-4a04-a3c2-d0baa7c7439b-1
01:50:28.829 --> 01:50:33.475
inside the boat and they're
standing and looking around and

c77fafc4-3553-4a04-a3c2-d0baa7c7439b-2
01:50:33.475 --> 01:50:37.967
then it looks like somebody's
conductor type person has a

c77fafc4-3553-4a04-a3c2-d0baa7c7439b-3
01:50:37.967 --> 01:50:42.769
megaphone and he's pointing like
directing them somewhere and

c77fafc4-3553-4a04-a3c2-d0baa7c7439b-4
01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:45.170
then two people open a gate up.

4d0299e5-0ecb-433d-a6f3-6c1f6b08a529-0
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:51.400
And there's a picture of a hand
with this holding the suitcase.

1f4615cc-12f7-4ac4-9ff4-1fa8b2bae346-0
01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:54.430
Um, and then a picture of.

28123a26-cc70-44a0-91ff-93813eff4953-0
01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.671
Families with
suitcases and, um, crates and

28123a26-cc70-44a0-91ff-93813eff4953-1
01:51:00.671 --> 01:51:05.708
packages walking like they're
getting off the ship. And then

28123a26-cc70-44a0-91ff-93813eff4953-2
01:51:05.708 --> 01:51:10.580
there's a line, a long line of
people with their suitcases

28123a26-cc70-44a0-91ff-93813eff4953-3
01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:15.700
getting off the ship. #END_arrival_2 right. So
we're done with this story.

6dac795b-78d3-411c-a676-f927934aff44-0
01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:22.650
The last one. Uh, we have
around 11 pages. Let's see.

5a8b8d6e-8281-4522-b8cf-e8b8a70d0687-0
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.570
Stop this one and start the next
one.

cf759050-79da-4f44-b907-40c6276a4df6-0
01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:49.620


8c1cc31f-d718-42c3-961d-8b44c056ec19-0
01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:53.310
So not the black and white
picture.

a26b48fb-ea5b-45f6-93e3-88dcece91917-0
01:51:57.380 --> 01:51:59.690
#START_flowerman It looks like a
town.

339b06f8-fee3-4254-981c-14d6aa7f0678-0
01:52:01.130 --> 01:52:04.940
There is a car in like an empty.

96139647-2d92-41fe-ac11-b443387a7a5e-0
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:13.430
pool of water or some type of
water because there was an old

96139647-2d92-41fe-ac11-b443387a7a5e-1
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:18.443
beat up dock and there's a
person with a green coat on.

96139647-2d92-41fe-ac11-b443387a7a5e-2
01:52:18.443 --> 01:52:23.994
It's the only color in in the
photo walking across the bridge

96139647-2d92-41fe-ac11-b443387a7a5e-3
01:52:23.994 --> 01:52:29.454
with the empty river or lake and
he's walking into a a town.

96139647-2d92-41fe-ac11-b443387a7a5e-4
01:52:29.454 --> 01:52:34.110
There's a gas station and a
Ferris wheel and a bar.

035c3170-56fc-494d-bc2c-2293b25b4abd-0
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:35.890
And bait shop.

df128021-a192-4bf3-a4b1-c1bca3ae5908-0
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.820
And some type of garage and some
other buildings. Some of the

df128021-a192-4bf3-a4b1-c1bca3ae5908-1
01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:45.140
buildings have like smoke coming
out of the chimneys and there's

df128021-a192-4bf3-a4b1-c1bca3ae5908-2
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.730
one other person that I see
walking along the street.

277a8817-3074-432b-8f2a-d17f98c8fb44-0
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:54.980
Um, so.

c988943b-123d-4d4a-89f4-a3b8410add59-0
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:59.657
It looks like it might be a man
with a green coat, and he has a

c988943b-123d-4d4a-89f4-a3b8410add59-1
01:52:59.657 --> 01:53:03.306
blue umbrella and blue hat. He's
holding a bag and he's walked

c988943b-123d-4d4a-89f4-a3b8410add59-2
01:53:03.306 --> 01:53:06.840
into the street. He's walking
down the street and everything

c988943b-123d-4d4a-89f4-a3b8410add59-3
01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.810
else is still in black and
white.

bcc7d38c-79fe-496f-8d7c-477c1f019b2a-0
01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:15.821
He's walking through the streets
and there's the houses are kind

bcc7d38c-79fe-496f-8d7c-477c1f019b2a-1
01:53:15.821 --> 01:53:20.873
of in disrepair, the shuttle
shutters on the windows are

bcc7d38c-79fe-496f-8d7c-477c1f019b2a-2
01:53:20.873 --> 01:53:26.456
falling off and the there's two
men on a roof looking, looking

bcc7d38c-79fe-496f-8d7c-477c1f019b2a-3
01:53:26.456 --> 01:53:26.900
down.

aeb2dd4b-9e99-413f-989e-5988b686b84b-0
01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:33.772
At the man in the next picture
you can see people in the

aeb2dd4b-9e99-413f-989e-5988b686b84b-1
01:53:33.772 --> 01:53:34.630
windows.

1cdce9e5-79f5-433c-8348-ab5ff597a9e3-0
01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:40.523
Of the houses, there's one
person on a motorcycle and one

1cdce9e5-79f5-433c-8348-ab5ff597a9e3-1
01:53:40.523 --> 01:53:42.970
per couple people driving a car.

dba669ac-42de-4eb7-9646-260efc96710e-0
01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:47.715
There's one people stand, one
person standing on the street,

dba669ac-42de-4eb7-9646-260efc96710e-1

another couple people walking, a
little boy standing on a

dba669ac-42de-4eb7-9646-260efc96710e-2
01:53:51.656 --> 01:53:52.199
balcony.

ea9aadc8-103d-4d3d-ab76-b4956200a69b-0
01:53:58.230 --> 01:54:04.300
So the man in the green coat and
the blue hat and the.

d8ec6967-887b-47ed-826e-025327d09c82-0
01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:12.167
The tote bag that he's carrying
continues walking and he stops

d8ec6967-887b-47ed-826e-025327d09c82-1
01:54:12.167 --> 01:54:17.244
at a house that looks like it's
in disrepair and there's a for

d8ec6967-887b-47ed-826e-025327d09c82-2

01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:24.440
And then there's people in the
windows.

16c3bfae-e5ca-4263-bb8d-deaf83e22343-0
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.750
Some of the other houses.

1cba664a-84bd-41ec-b1be-169ab3da088b-0
01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:32.162
A lot of people in and then the
next picture has all the houses

1cba664a-84bd-41ec-b1be-169ab3da088b-1
01:54:32.162 --> 01:54:32.540
to have.

8bff30f6-199a-4a38-99cd-82e4a0bca29e-0
01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:39.179
People in the windows doing
different things. The street

8bff30f6-199a-4a38-99cd-82e4a0bca29e-1
01:54:39.179 --> 01:54:43.556
lights are on, there's a couple
of people outside talking, and

8bff30f6-199a-4a38-99cd-82e4a0bca29e-2

people sitting on what looks
like a fountain.

ac248aa7-2939-46ba-bd4d-32fc19f1fd90-0
01:54:57.910 --> 01:55:01.828
So the next picture is all in
black and white except for the

ac248aa7-2939-46ba-bd4d-32fc19f1fd90-1
01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:05.040
man has taken off his coat. He
has blue shirt on.

ff5828aa-10c3-4cf9-b710-a2088d6f8ee2-0
01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.442
There's something red in the
yard. It might be a lawn mower,

ff5828aa-10c3-4cf9-b710-a2088d6f8ee2-1
01:55:11.442 --> 01:55:15.804
and he's fixing up the house
that he was looking at that was

ff5828aa-10c3-4cf9-b710-a2088d6f8ee2-2
01:55:15.804 --> 01:55:20.309
for sale. And the roof is now
purple and the shutters are blue

ff5828aa-10c3-4cf9-b710-a2088d6f8ee2-3
01:55:20.309 --> 01:55:24.814
and there's still people in the
window, all the windows of the

ff5828aa-10c3-4cf9-b710-a2088d6f8ee2-4
01:55:24.814 --> 01:55:25.530
different.

a28cbbc5-c436-4fef-b0af-c832f07fb7b7-0
01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:29.140
Houses right now.

01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:33.385
Um, there's a lot of people
walking around the streets.

18366cbb-1e62-422c-96b4-bf3bed217e27-1
01:55:33.385 --> 01:55:37.046
There's people in wheelchairs,
there's people in scooters, and

18366cbb-1e62-422c-96b4-bf3bed217e27-2

Briefcases.

ad181cf5-08b7-48a9-a950-b0ba587e083f-0
01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:42.640
Umm.

b321dd1f-4a31-40c1-ae2a-cebef2c9bd88-0
01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:45.070
there's a 

384ed443-ecb5-4d77-972f-fb3290744021-0

milkman

e5b3afb3-aab9-4238-aa6c-39a65a8ae3dd-0
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:54.115
And there's more activity in the
streets. And there's the little

e5b3afb3-aab9-4238-aa6c-39a65a8ae3dd-1
01:55:54.115 --> 01:55:57.555
boy is that was on the balcony
and was looking forlorn on the

e5b3afb3-aab9-4238-aa6c-39a65a8ae3dd-2
01:55:57.555 --> 01:56:00.606
at the fountain is still
standing there looking at the

e5b3afb3-aab9-4238-aa6c-39a65a8ae3dd-3

01:56:09.170 --> 01:56:14.294
So the man is in the yard of the
house that was for sale before,

8cca5a54-f1aa-4dfb-9656-dafc9b88b3b3-1
01:56:14.294 --> 01:56:18.945
and now he's has a fence around
the yard and he's planting

8cca5a54-f1aa-4dfb-9656-dafc9b88b3b3-2
01:56:18.945 --> 01:56:23.675
flowers and there's more color
of colorful flowers and then

8cca5a54-f1aa-4dfb-9656-dafc9b88b3b3-3
01:56:23.675 --> 01:56:26.749
there's a tree in the background

01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:32.057
Colorful orange and you can see
inside the house and there's

53c22a32-ea6d-4934-8ee1-749a96a476a5-1
01:56:32.057 --> 01:56:36.911
flowers on the windows and the
inside of the house is furniture

53c22a32-ea6d-4934-8ee1-749a96a476a5-2
01:56:36.911 --> 01:56:38.960
and it's all bright colors.

9717e305-273c-4bc8-86c3-0c0c4b3c8f48-0
01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.170
And the rest of the neighborhood
is still but in black and white.

34e132c2-8eb9-4f04-80f1-245a9bbe5dd3-0
01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:49.445
Um. In the next picture, though,
it's still all in black and

34e132c2-8eb9-4f04-80f1-245a9bbe5dd3-1
01:56:49.445 --> 01:56:53.472

reddish brown hair and a yellow
shirt and a blue skirt, and

34e132c2-8eb9-4f04-80f1-245a9bbe5dd3-3
01:56:57.638 --> 01:57:02.012
she's holding one of the flowers
looks like one of the flowers

34e132c2-8eb9-4f04-80f1-245a9bbe5dd3-4
01:57:02.012 --> 01:57:02.360
from.

f17ee869-2659-4e3e-8809-9b580561351b-0
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:08.850
The the man's yard and he's
might be waving at her.

908a26ae-7c7b-4e85-9cc3-64951770750e-0
01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.673
And there's still some activity,
and you can see people in the

908a26ae-7c7b-4e85-9cc3-64951770750e-1
01:57:14.673 --> 01:57:17.659
Windows, black and white, and
the little boy is still looking

908a26ae-7c7b-4e85-9cc3-64951770750e-2
01:57:17.659 --> 01:57:18.430
at the fountain.

9e64cd3c-f865-4e64-a96e-3ca26b7b4d15-0
01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:29.371
So in the next picture on the
left, now the the man and has

9e64cd3c-f865-4e64-a96e-3ca26b7b4d15-1
01:57:29.371 --> 01:57:33.841
finished fixing up the house and
he's talking to the neighbors.

9e64cd3c-f865-4e64-a96e-3ca26b7b4d15-2
01:57:33.841 --> 01:57:38.102
He has his hand on a woman's
shoulder and she's in color now

9e64cd3c-f865-4e64-a96e-3ca26b7b4d15-3
01:57:38.102 --> 01:57:42.293
and she's smiling. And then
there's another man next to him

9e64cd3c-f865-4e64-a96e-3ca26b7b4d15-4
01:57:42.293 --> 01:57:46.694

flowers, and he's in color and

9e64cd3c-f865-4e64-a96e-3ca26b7b4d15-5
01:57:46.694 --> 01:57:48.649
the little girls and colour.

e3acd5c3-f289-478d-b5c6-fd1fcad88809-0
01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.839
And another person is in color,
actually most of the people in

e3acd5c3-f289-478d-b5c6-fd1fcad88809-1
01:57:52.839 --> 01:57:53.060
the.

71ee051f-f6b5-4145-a57b-8be55525ff88-0
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.038
On the left hand side are all
now in color, but some of the

71ee051f-f6b5-4145-a57b-8be55525ff88-1
01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:03.010
houses are still in black and
white people in the windows.

71ee051f-f6b5-4145-a57b-8be55525ff88-2
01:58:03.010 --> 01:58:06.847
Some of the houses are getting
some color in them on the

71ee051f-f6b5-4145-a57b-8be55525ff88-3
01:58:06.847 --> 01:58:08.530
shutters and on the roof.

c11b171b-6510-43cb-9ba8-94215ffc744f-0
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:15.661
On the right hand side, there's
still people in the windows, but

c11b171b-6510-43cb-9ba8-94215ffc744f-1
01:58:15.661 --> 01:58:18.490
now some of the houses are have
color in them.

4a63bac1-8ec9-4b60-86db-003a92d55d47-0
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:23.008
Um, some of the shades and the
shutters and the roofs and a few

4a63bac1-8ec9-4b60-86db-003a92d55d47-1
01:58:23.008 --> 01:58:26.707
of the people are in color, and
a few of them are in black and

4a63bac1-8ec9-4b60-86db-003a92d55d47-2
01:58:26.707 --> 01:58:27.060
white.

2ce428e9-fe2b-4543-8c57-f9f2c6cc4898-0
01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:33.213
The boy is now in color and he's
looking into the fountain cause

2ce428e9-fe2b-4543-8c57-f9f2c6cc4898-1
01:58:33.213 --> 01:58:37.270
it looks like there's fish with
color in them now and.

8cccbf7a-8f01-4513-8364-da8cac9e7440-0
01:58:39.210 --> 01:58:43.548
There's a moving truck and
there's people. I can't tell

8cccbf7a-8f01-4513-8364-da8cac9e7440-1
01:58:43.548 --> 01:58:46.260
whether they're moving in and
out.

028876d1-ebb0-4088-87fc-8868ac53f831-0
01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:48.420
Some of the houses.

96bb9680-9787-4584-8d46-15ad3f18a467-0
01:58:53.250 --> 01:58:53.790
OK.

5f39ad37-c082-4e6f-80b9-ecf17f285b72-0
01:58:54.570 --> 01:58:56.800
So the picture on the left.

48a0c7b2-f507-4168-99cf-05c20a871192-0
01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:04.048
Um, the man is in his yard and
he's now grilling and all the

48a0c7b2-f507-4168-99cf-05c20a871192-1
01:59:04.048 --> 01:59:08.797
people, he's talking to the
people and all the people are in

48a0c7b2-f507-4168-99cf-05c20a871192-2
01:59:08.797 --> 01:59:12.690
the streets talking and they're
all in color now.

901b3784-e97f-4a02-b71f-71b198048fbc-0
01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:16.150
People in the windows.

caeee214-ed27-4341-a457-4eab428ffc69-0
01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:19.230
All the houses are in color.

a791252f-e4a5-4225-939e-dfce38711311-0
01:59:20.450 --> 01:59:21.920
And on the right.

1b5f3f6a-e813-4c13-8ba0-2a91bb6c7f4c-0
01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:27.009
Looks like everybody's in color
now also, and they're happy and

1b5f3f6a-e813-4c13-8ba0-2a91bb6c7f4c-1
01:59:27.009 --> 01:59:30.111
they're smiling and they're
talking to each other. And

1b5f3f6a-e813-4c13-8ba0-2a91bb6c7f4c-2
01:59:30.111 --> 01:59:33.721
there's people driving in cars
and the boys now in the fountain

1b5f3f6a-e813-4c13-8ba0-2a91bb6c7f4c-3
01:59:33.721 --> 01:59:36.880
is now working. And there's blue
water in the fountain.

6240ec17-6c53-4252-8f50-4e6df3a79b9b-0
01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:46.819
There's people driving in cars
with color, there's people with

6240ec17-6c53-4252-8f50-4e6df3a79b9b-1
01:59:46.819 --> 01:59:52.620
with paintings on the sidewalk,
and Yep, everything's in color.

d9bf77e9-3ff8-412b-96fa-5ef4f7a55f6d-0
01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:54.640
Uh.

6e1aa36c-248f-46dc-824e-5fd22c441f9d-0
01:59:57.210 --> 01:59:59.680

02:00:01.730 --> 02:00:05.865
Darker colors. It's all
colorful, but it's kind of

13d23d01-6793-49da-88ef-72c1b4a42b40-1
02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:10.812
darker against others. I think
that's the man with the green

13d23d01-6793-49da-88ef-72c1b4a42b40-2
02:00:10.812 --> 02:00:14.300
coat and he's walking away from
the house.

efdb0d64-b313-4752-b9c9-2d888a09e8a0-0
02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:17.260
With his bag.

68a45a96-5f04-4e61-881e-a98183dc6f48-0
02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:22.781
All the people from the
neighborhood are still talking

68a45a96-5f04-4e61-881e-a98183dc6f48-1
02:00:22.781 --> 02:00:27.365
to each other. It looks like
people have met each other and

68a45a96-5f04-4e61-881e-a98183dc6f48-2
02:00:27.365 --> 02:00:31.948
fallen in love. The kids are
playing. There's people in the

68a45a96-5f04-4e61-881e-a98183dc6f48-3
02:00:31.948 --> 02:00:32.560
windows.

5f972a07-64fb-45e3-95f0-b2f4f9a9ac3b-0
02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:38.295
There's people out of their
houses that were in the windows

5f972a07-64fb-45e3-95f0-b2f4f9a9ac3b-1
02:00:38.295 --> 02:00:41.850
before. Now they're on the roofs
or they're in the streets.

8b942bd3-6427-480a-965e-3a618a50cf9f-0
02:00:42.670 --> 02:00:43.390
Um.

941fede2-a819-4070-b951-df3c52a13ada-0
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:49.745
From playing with each other and
socializing and laughing and

941fede2-a819-4070-b951-df3c52a13ada-1
02:00:49.745 --> 02:00:50.210
happy.

a66bd016-39f9-4494-a3c5-7449d63ab507-0
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.936
Oh now the man in the green coat
is walking down the street and

a66bd016-39f9-4494-a3c5-7449d63ab507-1
02:00:58.936 --> 02:01:02.850
it looks like it's night time
again. The street lights are on.

0335faa2-8e91-491f-b3bb-4c51dc8b2e0d-0
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:04.690
Um.

8c9560d5-fec1-4d43-8034-949a34c46cd7-0
02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:11.652
Everything looks like it's the
houses look like they're losing

8c9560d5-fec1-4d43-8034-949a34c46cd7-1
02:01:11.652 --> 02:01:16.385
color again in the houses look
like they're in disrepair again

8c9560d5-fec1-4d43-8034-949a34c46cd7-2
02:01:16.385 --> 02:01:20.968
with the drapes or shredded in
the windows, and the shutters

8c9560d5-fec1-4d43-8034-949a34c46cd7-3
02:01:20.968 --> 02:01:22.169
are falling off.

6e3f0ba1-d892-434e-abe8-8d7280116612-0
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:25.970
And then the other picture it
looks like.

ffaea839-6887-4300-b4d3-9566eafb7947-0
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:32.574
It's hard to tell. It looks like
there's still people out in the

ffaea839-6887-4300-b4d3-9566eafb7947-1
02:01:32.574 --> 02:01:37.558
windows and socializing, but
it's very dark outside in colors

ffaea839-6887-4300-b4d3-9566eafb7947-2
02:01:37.558 --> 02:01:42.220
or dark. The colors on the roofs
and the houses are dark.

76d2d5db-1761-4b98-9d73-1101c96d6abd-0
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:46.810
So then.

8bde3018-68c9-495c-89d6-d8cb5b3b493c-0
02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:50.030
Um.

7e9bc785-ec43-4840-874a-a80d72729d86-0
02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:56.860
It's a photo of everything's
black and white again, except

7e9bc785-ec43-4840-874a-a80d72729d86-1
02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:01.681
for the purples. The sky is
purple and everybody looks sad

7e9bc785-ec43-4840-874a-a80d72729d86-2
02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:05.440
again and they're all there.
There's one guy.

e59417b9-39c0-4318-9913-0d039bf45069-0
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.823
That looks like he's drinking
and sitting on the fountain, but

e59417b9-39c0-4318-9913-0d039bf45069-1
02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:15.184
everybody else is inside the
house again, and they're all in

e59417b9-39c0-4318-9913-0d039bf45069-2
02:02:15.184 --> 02:02:18.830
the windows and it's all black
and white. And then

7b7e3595-7ecc-4aa2-abe9-4616ae67d280-0
02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:25.251
Second photos. Everything again
is in black and white, except

7b7e3595-7ecc-4aa2-abe9-4616ae67d280-1
02:02:25.251 --> 02:02:29.288

02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:37.213
And he walks to another house.
He's holding something that

a91b85fa-8f62-4d93-b840-639a790337c8-1
02:02:37.213 --> 02:02:38.940
looks like a candle.

a8166109-e5f5-46a0-944a-f48962486ffc-0
02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:44.838
And he looks at another
townhouse type house and it says

a8166109-e5f5-46a0-944a-f48962486ffc-1

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:57.689
Ohh, he maybe he was holding
flowers, I'm not sure. But

a8bb6761-9224-4061-a748-e929d3aa1c5c-1
02:02:57.689 --> 02:02:58.430
anyways he.

76f15f37-4475-42b1-bedb-7a8109072939-0
02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:06.278
Walks away and a boy. A girl is

02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:13.656
Her dress was on
color, she looks happy, and a

96159bd5-75f3-42b5-978c-10401fce6d2c-1
02:03:13.656 --> 02:03:17.133

red. He has a red, his bow tie
turned red, and he looks

96159bd5-75f3-42b5-978c-10401fce6d2c-3
02:03:20.273 --> 02:03:23.749
happier. But everything else is
in black and white except for

96159bd5-75f3-42b5-978c-10401fce6d2c-4

OK, that is everything.
