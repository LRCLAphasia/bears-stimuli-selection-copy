00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.579
So first we're starting out
with a complex scene. So you are

3e9a9368-f41a-418d-9c39-bbf02ebd3a2f-1
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.298
about to see a complex scene.
Imagine you are describing the

3e9a9368-f41a-418d-9c39-bbf02ebd3a2f-2
00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:16.139
scenes as someone who cannot see
the picture. Describe what is

3e9a9368-f41a-418d-9c39-bbf02ebd3a2f-3
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.675
happening and what you see in
this scene as thoroughly as

3e9a9368-f41a-418d-9c39-bbf02ebd3a2f-4
00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:23.150
possible. And with complex
scenes we ask that you take.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.008
Roughly 3 to 5 minutes to
describe the scene, so I'm going

4bafec61-1e29-4b5b-a470-ce01c11a9961-1
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:29.750

it's going like way over or if

3ee56ac1-41e3-4773-ae6e-9b49edb216ed-2

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.897
And it's, um, 2 pages. Um,

e9e11bbc-9e0d-4805-908e-038c8d7bbb90-1
00:07:13.897 --> 00:07:16.590

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.390
If that's relevant.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.182
It says it's me again, Waldo.
Folks, some very strange things

66e13d08-d566-4c37-9a31-33ac6ce1f6fc-1
00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:36.886
happen in the airport this
morning. A helicopter chopped

66e13d08-d566-4c37-9a31-33ac6ce1f6fc-2
00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:39.496
down all the flagpoles, the
smuggler was caught hiding

66e13d08-d566-4c37-9a31-33ac6ce1f6fc-3
00:07:39.496 --> 00:07:42.391

00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:43.530
onto a jumbo jet. Weird.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.414
And it's to auto focus under the
carpet, under the bed, down

6ee046b9-fdf6-4aa2-88ef-f862769d2fd4-1
00:07:48.414 --> 00:07:52.788

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.430
One of them has attached to the
underside of the boat.

82b74234-d1be-4045-bb66-a93ba609f9b2-0

You know human body with thumb
hands and can't see if they have

a69c3f3d-39db-4619-9e61-b346d3ef2bdf-1
00:31:55.234 --> 00:31:55.510

line down in the water, and it's
hooked to fish.

4803a146-35ab-44f8-9cb9-887959c8d966-0
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.786
So the the boat is fishing and
one of those sea creatures with

4803a146-35ab-44f8-9cb9-887959c8d966-1
00:32:11.786 --> 00:32:15.049

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.960
Some fish look up at this fish
getting hooked and pulled away.

4f134b1c-cd5f-4a92-9b60-2813bd2b0704-0
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.960

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:48.770
So the boat has continued on and
now there's.

c5d800cd-acb5-47e4-9876-f937d38f0d24-0
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.020
Um, some fish trying to check

84b6dedc-5f0d-4a45-a410-6ad3a2c850e3-0
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.681
And see what's going on. So 1
Fish has stuck its head up out

seahorse. Black and white

84b6dedc-5f0d-4a45-a410-6ad3a2c850e3-2
00:33:00.106 --> 00:33:01.210

d9488b16-cb55-49a6-a6ad-2ce0237ee9b4-0
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.770
With a little little cap.

bb27f502-6816-43ff-af75-449b3e178744-0
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.171

um, so that he's out of the

bb27f502-6816-43ff-af75-449b3e178744-1
00:33:08.171 --> 00:33:10.350
water and he can look at the
boat.

9d2909e9-8a64-47f8-b9cd-6cde557d07cd-0
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.540

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:18.710
Then, as the book continues on,
there's a whole cluster of

20f08b7e-e9bf-4f38-8df5-f01eff2d1414-1
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.480
Stingrays.

e83ee2cd-3ca3-4075-91b6-5945bb4a7bde-0
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.552
One of which has a tentacle up
through the water and into the

e83ee2cd-3ca3-4075-91b6-5945bb4a7bde-1
00:33:26.552 --> 00:33:31.071
boat and the black and white
checkered seahorses has climbed

e83ee2cd-3ca3-4075-91b6-5945bb4a7bde-2
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:33.220
on board the boat and is now.

07eb74a8-63a5-4088-8959-b9b7e60ec00f-0
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.690
Running at the front like the
captain.

07eb387e-1a50-45e1-94ff-bdfae8c4f145-0
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:41.960
Um, like a proud captain. Sort
of chest out, you know, as the

07eb387e-1a50-45e1-94ff-bdfae8c4f145-1
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.680
boat passes forward.

dc7153d4-5e81-4ca7-9368-005a856e727a-0
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.530
The boat is sailing.

8eb556d5-3bf3-4b96-8881-d86afcac7aad-0
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.080
So it's.

13eeaf8e-cdc8-433b-9886-2d6edb0cf88c-0

Umm.

ed07cf55-fbd0-43b1-936f-3b81adc23b6c-0
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:02.161
So the the water has changed um
instead of just like empty

ed07cf55-fbd0-43b1-936f-3b81adc23b6c-1
00:34:02.161 --> 00:34:02.600
ocean.

a56a5d04-3c34-477d-8ea4-699f6c7a78db-0
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.482
It's sailing through water that
now has like flowers, um, poking

a56a5d04-3c34-477d-8ea4-699f6c7a78db-1
00:34:07.482 --> 00:34:11.098
up out of the water with white
petals, and it's sailing into

a56a5d04-3c34-477d-8ea4-699f6c7a78db-2
00:34:11.098 --> 00:34:12.640
something that looks like.

ddfc92f2-c9a5-4c38-99de-55706fc4393a-0
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.189
Maybe like a a mangrove swamp or
something like that. It's like

ddfc92f2-c9a5-4c38-99de-55706fc4393a-1
00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:20.930
trees that have roots down into
the water.

7092ebfc-520a-48a2-b04c-d3c4ca52fb0c-0
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.820
And a lot of leaves, and there
are cranes.

2d0c65fc-5556-4e68-803c-a68715f229a6-0
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.450
Um.

653aa7f5-1dfd-4469-841a-2afac5bd254d-0
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.148
Bunch of white cranes standing
all over the trees, um, from top

653aa7f5-1dfd-4469-841a-2afac5bd254d-1
00:34:31.148 --> 00:34:34.621
to bottom, standing on the
branches and the leaves, and

653aa7f5-1dfd-4469-841a-2afac5bd254d-2
00:34:34.621 --> 00:34:38.403
there's an opening in the in
these trees that the boat looks

653aa7f5-1dfd-4469-841a-2afac5bd254d-3
00:34:38.403 --> 00:34:39.830
like it's sailing into.

13fe9e72-02bd-42f8-8058-c407634a6f85-0
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.930
Ready for the next page

62bbd298-e0f2-4757-a288-0fe61690a9d9-0
00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.480
Um, the boat has sailed inside

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.767
The trees and we can see more
closely the the cranes or Swans

5d17c26c-f8f4-4b19-8ffa-9554353b856a-1
00:34:58.767 --> 00:35:03.152
with the long necks and the
flowers that are reaching down

5d17c26c-f8f4-4b19-8ffa-9554353b856a-2
00:35:03.152 --> 00:35:06.720
into the water. We see the fish
underwater and.

fc377f39-66fe-4356-82f0-4501be79579a-0
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.259
Or schools of fish, some fish
with dark fish with glowing

fc377f39-66fe-4356-82f0-4501be79579a-1
00:35:12.259 --> 00:35:12.680
eyes.

5e75594a-8421-45c9-a696-90d6647f6143-0
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.010
Um, so the birds sailing into
all this mysterious.

2b67db49-c46a-4d7c-a266-aa367c1fc5b3-0
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:18.820
Wildlife.

9958dbbd-3cdd-4381-b069-ea71fe99cc8f-0
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:30.791
Now we're inside the trees and
it's dark in here. Um, other

9958dbbd-3cdd-4381-b069-ea71fe99cc8f-1
00:35:30.791 --> 00:35:35.355
birds with glowing eyes and
other other animals looks like

9958dbbd-3cdd-4381-b069-ea71fe99cc8f-2
00:35:35.355 --> 00:35:36.980
like a little weasel.

e71fa220-2e04-4fb0-96e6-9ad0423374e7-0
00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.440
Looking creature or something.

e7507119-aca4-432d-ba2b-1ec383e1dfbf-0
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.231
And it's it's so dark that the
or maybe like an alligator kind

e7507119-aca4-432d-ba2b-1ec383e1dfbf-1
00:35:44.231 --> 00:35:46.340
of see like the Ridge of scales
on the.

0da39e75-85a4-4e86-b34f-8cbd28ae2ec1-0
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.580
On the animal's back and um.

19b2f81d-c1e7-48e5-8aec-63d0d5aafafb-0
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.648
And the birds and these these
alligators like because it's so

19b2f81d-c1e7-48e5-8aec-63d0d5aafafb-1
00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:57.976
dark. I guess they're but their
eyes are reflecting the light

19b2f81d-c1e7-48e5-8aec-63d0d5aafafb-2
00:35:57.976 --> 00:36:01.196
and glowing and some small
little crabs and and things. The

19b2f81d-c1e7-48e5-8aec-63d0d5aafafb-3
00:36:01.196 --> 00:36:04.310
trees are so close together that
everything is in shadow.

028f255f-7510-4f12-b811-2dcc5822b8ef-0
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.541
And our seahorse is still
proudly aboard our our little

028f255f-7510-4f12-b811-2dcc5822b8ef-1
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:08.860
boat.

bb580795-baec-45b0-b22b-a6c5dd7701b6-0
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.010
Now it looks like the the boat
is sailing out of the trees.

8cd7f54c-e3e9-4c21-823f-fc0821948ac5-0
00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.320
And um.

581ad1ce-b8bf-4765-bdf0-96fbd9ac95d1-0
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.527
Um, a big sea creature who's
running on like a a lobster or

581ad1ce-b8bf-4765-bdf0-96fbd9ac95d1-1
00:36:29.527 --> 00:36:30.210
crayfish.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.430
It's a horse, um, and as it
sails out.

f3a2ab90-34fe-4818-871a-9bc42744727e-0
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.600

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.908
The seahorse that's on our boat
sees a bunch of other seahorses

0ecea17c-15c3-421d-983e-f3e20639b02a-1
00:36:45.908 --> 00:36:49.491
looking up at him and it looks
like maybe he's jumped out of

0ecea17c-15c3-421d-983e-f3e20639b02a-2
00:36:49.491 --> 00:36:50.020
the boat.

34d26706-f6f3-44b2-ac90-6634a976441e-0
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.497
his cap is flying One Direction
and he looks like maybe he's

34d26706-f6f3-44b2-ac90-6634a976441e-1
00:36:54.497 --> 00:36:55.180
gonna fall.

d82c66d3-d7a2-49cb-a304-652fecd02ef7-0
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.540
And join with the other sea
horses.

10a69f0c-fbda-4736-83ca-5649f5a0b4d4-0
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.112
Um, now the boat is sailing
past. Uh, another huge whale,

10a69f0c-fbda-4736-83ca-5649f5a0b4d4-1
00:37:09.112 --> 00:37:09.790
that is.

97602f42-da2c-4ccd-b702-8fc0c4fbfdba-0
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.540
Sort of like sitting up in the
water with the top of his head.

9bb8c30e-6e72-4d50-8291-eb2bafcbacb6-0
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:20.399
Out of the water, looking like
he's smoking a pipe out of his

9bb8c30e-6e72-4d50-8291-eb2bafcbacb6-1
00:37:20.399 --> 00:37:21.330
his air hole.

1236e53d-243d-4aa4-9c88-c6752245f86b-0
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:26.668
And the birds are hanging out on
top of his head. Um. Next the

1236e53d-243d-4aa4-9c88-c6752245f86b-1
00:37:26.668 --> 00:37:31.048
boat sails passed another huge
sea creature with like white

1236e53d-243d-4aa4-9c88-c6752245f86b-2
00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:34.260
white spots all the way down his
belly and.

97614afc-5081-43df-af75-5c44891370b7-0
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.310
Um, he looks like he's got a.

2673a92b-bf7e-4c1f-81f1-76ca4c76722d-0
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.990
Fishing rod with a TV or radio
hanging off the top.

de59b5a2-cf93-421e-a282-21314ecbeebc-0
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.330
And he's standing on top of a.

dac1b858-7333-44ae-aa41-d68a1dd43fc4-0
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.460
A collection of.

6d8f4478-c223-49c3-b206-fc5aaa246551-0
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.590
Boats and shipwreck boats and.

08cd12f3-5700-4974-bd2d-30b9961a70c9-0
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.005
Um, all piled together with all
the masts sticking out and

08cd12f3-5700-4974-bd2d-30b9961a70c9-1
00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:54.940
things like that.

0c937f95-4e60-4172-ad21-41fc1f9b64b7-0
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.360
Uh, it's the sun is starting to
set.

cfce4447-16a5-4cf7-b69b-a925103348ce-0
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.790
The boat is still seeing through
the ocean, but.

1fd4716d-7b47-445b-b9ff-77555abf2116-0
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.836
You know, there's just a number
of this. The sun is setting and

1fd4716d-7b47-445b-b9ff-77555abf2116-1
00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:14.428
the moon is coming out, and
there are a number of new

1fd4716d-7b47-445b-b9ff-77555abf2116-2
00:38:14.428 --> 00:38:16.490
creatures, like land birds and.

9d7c4f9d-c325-494c-935c-33b9f1d24f47-0
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:20.100
odd fantasy looking creatures
like a a

cc1334c3-dc8b-4e25-a8d4-3bfdff7635fd-0
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.250
A part jester.

45420f91-3ac3-40e5-95f3-7a501094a57e-0
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:29.123
Dolphin thing. Um elephants with
long trunks and wavy ears. A

45420f91-3ac3-40e5-95f3-7a501094a57e-1
00:38:29.123 --> 00:38:33.743
Jaguar with flippered feet. A
cat is trying to run away and

45420f91-3ac3-40e5-95f3-7a501094a57e-2
00:38:33.743 --> 00:38:36.900
from these things and get into
the boat.

20e6a06f-5c1f-422a-b931-2dc44fdb09ac-0
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:38.650
Um.

030ae0b7-da6d-4b4e-9345-0bd908e2e973-0
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.111
And all these different
creatures are kind of looking at

030ae0b7-da6d-4b4e-9345-0bd908e2e973-1
00:38:43.111 --> 00:38:46.539
the boat or some swimming or
flying towards it. It's a big

030ae0b7-da6d-4b4e-9345-0bd908e2e973-2
00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:47.760
snake on the horizon.

b3c4161c-bfdd-4ebd-ac19-e97a37bb50cc-0
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.850
With his mouth open.

995a0c00-fb78-4d3d-a935-cca6b601a086-0
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.090
Now it's night time. The sun is
set, the sky is dark, full of

995a0c00-fb78-4d3d-a935-cca6b601a086-1
00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:01.539
stars. There's a Crescent moon,
and you can still see the Milky

995a0c00-fb78-4d3d-a935-cca6b601a086-2
00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:02.860
Way across the sky.

2a595ab9-594f-469a-a266-e4830f7fb9d1-0
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.670
And a number of night time sea
creatures, um.

cf108fdf-d2c0-4ab0-bb2e-a3d46caffc54-0
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.550
With their eyes glowing, I'll
just swimming around the boat.

36c16d23-34cb-4563-b697-666229474e54-0
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.655
And they have surrounded the
boats. It's a bunch of fish with

36c16d23-34cb-4563-b697-666229474e54-1
00:39:19.655 --> 00:39:20.320
their fins.

6109b444-0464-4a14-aabf-ed7b0aef4517-0
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:25.243
And the boat is white and bright
and almost like it's giving off

6109b444-0464-4a14-aabf-ed7b0aef4517-1
00:39:25.243 --> 00:39:25.760
a light.

d55adc49-df3c-478c-b8fe-209576874e83-0
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.030
And all these dark fish, their
eyes are reflecting the glow.

1596e6aa-9512-4335-bc3c-518d6c102665-0
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.780
And they're just in a.

35ac5546-9566-4368-b335-8e9214d8dfe3-0
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.720
Just in a huge circle
surrounding the little boat.

0e16dfff-2cb6-45b3-ab1c-43b3e56783c8-0
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.020
And they have swam away the.

9c1afb8c-6bf3-4227-95db-cb314bfc4549-0
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:47.000
The Aurora borealis is rippling
across the sky. Huge.

2e89e4f6-8420-42c1-9b22-ad886eb6cf82-0
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.650
Sheets of light waving.

8b3475d3-f567-42b0-bcc7-f4d1a013ffcd-0
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.050
And um.

93f47ecc-be5b-40e4-bac1-8e9744f05f1d-0
00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.830
All the fish look like they have
disappeared, you know?

7aaff9bf-da38-4b18-9b3c-0f05be3fd623-0
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.450
Sort of swimming away from this
huge light show.

465048e8-309c-42b9-b12d-020c3a9a0eb9-0
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.980
That's happening above the
little boat.

9c8b25c0-8a76-4282-9db4-dbe90cea47f4-0
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.910
And now the boat

9023bbe6-d7bb-4faf-9a16-632370dfab56-0
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.010
It looks like it's traveling
next to a huge iceberg.

eb50b697-9ff7-40de-ab2d-2698453f86e1-0
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:22.332
It looks like a big Cliff with
sheer Cliff walls rising up out

eb50b697-9ff7-40de-ab2d-2698453f86e1-1
00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:23.330
of the ocean.

a8a45eca-74e5-4ca7-b5d2-d1884d7bb89b-0
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:29.337
And a large white surface tilted
towards the ocean just looks

a8a45eca-74e5-4ca7-b5d2-d1884d7bb89b-1
00:40:29.337 --> 00:40:33.400
like a mountain inside, you
know, in the water.

931a5b36-9408-4458-984b-f7eefe858278-0
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:42.763
And the boat is sailing through
the there are little ice flows

931a5b36-9408-4458-984b-f7eefe858278-1
00:40:42.763 --> 00:40:47.559
along with this glacier in the
water, and the boat is sailing

931a5b36-9408-4458-984b-f7eefe858278-2
00:40:47.559 --> 00:40:52.355
through them and into a little
cave that's in the ice. And as

931a5b36-9408-4458-984b-f7eefe858278-3
00:40:52.355 --> 00:40:56.686
it enters The Cave mouth, it
starts going through these

931a5b36-9408-4458-984b-f7eefe858278-4
00:40:56.686 --> 00:40:58.930
tunnels that are rounded out.

c5be8bb1-bd05-44c5-b768-bcc9fff7c2b7-0
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.313
And um, sailing around the
different corners through these

c5be8bb1-bd05-44c5-b768-bcc9fff7c2b7-1
00:41:03.313 --> 00:41:05.030
these tunnels in the iceberg.

0bae7d3b-0865-42dd-bf1e-367e662faa90-0
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.150
And um.

23268525-46f4-46e3-b23e-02b74f470ff6-0
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.537
As the boat sails out of the
iceberg, a tentacle with a

23268525-46f4-46e3-b23e-02b74f470ff6-1
00:41:18.537 --> 00:41:21.450
spotlight comes up out of the
water.

36880166-1502-45e0-967a-a32090838f13-0
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.770
And then this huge.

e4f612ed-a152-4386-8696-5a8d9652f41f-0
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:25.730
Creature.

0001ed8c-f70b-40f4-90b3-b31a0056327b-0
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.090
In a diving suit with.

68cb4135-a957-458e-9c92-59211ef563a3-0
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.170
Fish flippers for hands.

073bc242-312f-4037-9488-c1ccdf5a8478-0
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.861
Um, and light coming out of
these these light tentacles

073bc242-312f-4037-9488-c1ccdf5a8478-1
00:41:38.861 --> 00:41:40.240
coming off its body.

cb8c5185-fa58-4770-bf62-db34ac98873c-0
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.652
And light coming out of it's the
eyes and the diving helmets. Um,

cb8c5185-fa58-4770-bf62-db34ac98873c-1
00:41:45.652 --> 00:41:49.210
it picks up the boat and it's
looking at it, inspecting it.

cf504d73-4089-451e-b63b-1c34031c16fd-0
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.240
Umm.

ce26c188-06f1-4b3d-b7d1-39c9afc8246d-0
00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:10.838
And um, the boat is free that
that creature with the light

ce26c188-06f1-4b3d-b7d1-39c9afc8246d-1
00:42:10.838 --> 00:42:15.871
tentacles. We see a tentacle
sticking on the water, but the

ce26c188-06f1-4b3d-b7d1-39c9afc8246d-2
00:42:15.871 --> 00:42:21.156
rest of the creature is nowhere
to be seen and a big huge like

ce26c188-06f1-4b3d-b7d1-39c9afc8246d-3
00:42:21.156 --> 00:42:25.350
ocean steam ocean liner
steamship has come along.

2d86d177-5899-4154-a210-aa4f75568cdd-0
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.037
Um, maybe scare that creature
away and there's a ton of black

2d86d177-5899-4154-a210-aa4f75568cdd-1
00:42:30.037 --> 00:42:33.785
smoke in the air and this thing
is really tall and there's an

2d86d177-5899-4154-a210-aa4f75568cdd-2
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.720
anchor hanging off the side and.

6c272d70-a643-41a3-9129-16183b5f3a3d-0
00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.230
Um.

b029f888-b082-47f3-94e8-6fd54a61eac1-0
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.723
Birds flying along the bottom
looks like there's there's more

b029f888-b082-47f3-94e8-6fd54a61eac1-1
00:42:41.723 --> 00:42:45.639
than one boat and just massive
and they have things hanging off

b029f888-b082-47f3-94e8-6fd54a61eac1-2
00:42:45.639 --> 00:42:46.190
the side.

fe2d554d-e543-46d8-8432-e8f72121dfd7-0
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:54.855
And the boat is, um, sailed past
that, and other birds in the sky

fe2d554d-e543-46d8-8432-e8f72121dfd7-1
00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:55.290
again.

159532f2-2c71-414b-8459-67240abfaece-0
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.110
Um.

e6edbee3-bf5d-4429-a474-00f3310a77b5-0
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.620
The the huge steam thing is is
leaving.

229d0fdd-22c2-4a5f-9484-9ab80d7a0641-0
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.660
There's a ton of smoke in the
air.

bcfe5a6a-2e6e-4750-9674-b278a124e6b5-0
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.740
And um.

42b6ac5f-bb64-4cf4-b284-27bcd3817190-0
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.840
You see like platforms and
smokestacks and.

71c80a9a-fd12-4673-bd8d-7a758a8d981d-0
00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.817
Uh, all the smoke is is making
the birds sick, and they're all

71c80a9a-fd12-4673-bd8d-7a758a8d981d-1
00:43:16.817 --> 00:43:18.280
they're falling from the sky.

e73f28f5-ce79-4a67-be0e-e3ce60a70c94-0
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.660
And into the water.

52926344-38b3-458b-996b-c0970e13a13c-0
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.450
Kind of overcome with the smoke.

e3674433-c305-4ec7-8131-041b93894894-0
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.970
And.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.680
From the side of the so we see
the side of a boat.

560c89bc-312b-4408-8cf2-72befd6ce07b-0
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.350
Or a big tower.

dd07fa46-6688-4501-9fe0-49e06ebc1396-0
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.277
And there's a a big anchor and
people are like people in this

dd07fa46-6688-4501-9fe0-49e06ebc1396-1
00:43:44.277 --> 00:43:48.241
tower are shooting at the boat
and and one of the shots has

dd07fa46-6688-4501-9fe0-49e06ebc1396-2
00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:49.960
gone through the the mast.

05240a13-9f25-4061-a59f-7ef718e7781c-0
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.890
And created a whole.

b694669e-6474-4ff4-a43b-ce01ee2fee33-0
00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:57.203
Um, and someone has come out and
they're on a rocket. They're in

b694669e-6474-4ff4-a43b-ce01ee2fee33-1
00:43:57.203 --> 00:44:01.186
like a metal suit, and they're
on a rocket boat and they're

b694669e-6474-4ff4-a43b-ce01ee2fee33-2
00:44:01.186 --> 00:44:04.770
trying. Looks like they're going
to reach and try to.

3dba185d-6af0-463e-9da7-aa2719e2a26a-0
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.060
Try to get the boat they thrown
a.

525de7d7-95a2-4f3d-89d6-b8c66f24db41-0
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.610
A life.

602a1559-338f-4d5a-8e7c-ee66952753d1-0
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.530
Life Circle life vest on it.

515f67dd-b6f2-4ea8-b507-b5429fee2cfb-0
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.290
Preserver.

b49d78c8-a62d-4edc-9691-4c3337702558-0
00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:23.210
And this guy has has hooked the
boat and is following along

b49d78c8-a62d-4edc-9691-4c3337702558-1
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.410
behind it on the slate
preserver.

ceab9ae4-7652-4096-9d8d-e9d545609f28-0
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:30.480
Um, as the boat sails towards a
number of fantastical creatures.

844fb736-d815-4c6f-90ac-7c66c8085888-0
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:38.223
Black Horse with white spots and
an antlered thing with stars on

844fb736-d815-4c6f-90ac-7c66c8085888-1
00:44:38.223 --> 00:44:43.400
its skin and the gesture looking
fish. Checkered creature.

88e13d03-356f-4748-b686-d4ddbb391e75-0
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.230
Um and a.

838b7a6f-7eca-48a9-badb-741c6f25af7a-0
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.063
Like there's a cat and a kite
and the creature with the horn

838b7a6f-7eca-48a9-badb-741c6f25af7a-1
00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:55.479
and the black skeleton suit that
we saw in a Cape that we saw at

838b7a6f-7eca-48a9-badb-741c6f25af7a-2
00:44:55.479 --> 00:44:56.430
the beginning.

8f933034-6c97-43db-8f7a-8fb159fbd754-0
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.000
are all looking at this boat and
the creature falling behind.

521fec49-9da6-4008-8469-047795aded77-0
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.364
And how a big huge wave is
forming and the boat is getting

521fec49-9da6-4008-8469-047795aded77-1
00:45:09.364 --> 00:45:10.560
caught up in the wave.

cf469c12-eba8-457d-9854-53ac36310bd2-0
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:17.038
And the kite is ripped and two
little boys are hanging on to

cf469c12-eba8-457d-9854-53ac36310bd2-1
00:45:17.038 --> 00:45:17.420
the.

41405363-f5dd-43ee-80d1-f8ad7d84fe4a-0
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.910
This sticks with the kite in.

a84124fc-d9ae-4056-b86a-6bdebcf57d5b-0
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.430
Umm.

f2a69098-f890-4049-81fc-cb23923c2374-0
00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.058
And the the black skeleton
creature with the horn is

f2a69098-f890-4049-81fc-cb23923c2374-1
00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:31.876
standing on a mast and has a
huge paper airplane in his hand.

f2a69098-f890-4049-81fc-cb23923c2374-2
00:45:31.876 --> 00:45:34.830
It looks like he's about to
throw it.

95cb0f96-c70d-4541-a8e7-d80b0ca316fa-0
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.100
Towards the boat.

c007b13e-4161-4b45-bb19-ad9f904fb936-0
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.646
And as lightning strikes in the
sky overhead. In the dark sky

c007b13e-4161-4b45-bb19-ad9f904fb936-1
00:45:46.646 --> 00:45:47.140
overhead.

b252ecd3-32de-4039-a397-e84f65c5e172-0
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.780
Uh, the paper airplane flies
over the boat.

e654a6e1-f39f-4610-bf36-67678af90032-0
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.370
Which is free from the wave and.

31c4aa45-079c-49b2-b4ce-4e8bb8c50992-0
00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.944
Now sailing through um, big huge
loops of a huge sea snake, sea

31c4aa45-079c-49b2-b4ce-4e8bb8c50992-1
00:46:01.944 --> 00:46:02.660
serpent.

564db281-4957-4eda-855e-13308075a23c-0
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.350
One of the head of which has
caught the paper airplane.

01a804bc-22e2-40a1-aab7-a4fb117592b9-0
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.840
And inside the loop of the sea
serpent.

b99c2b2b-6b2b-467d-9bd1-4a6344a12e68-0
00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.810
We see more creatures like a
narwhal.

9439467e-8f7d-479b-a8d7-b734770aed3f-0
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.589
The head of the serpent, again,
because it's dark, the eyes are

9439467e-8f7d-479b-a8d7-b734770aed3f-1
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:24.476
glowing, and the poor boat with
a little hole in its sail is

9439467e-8f7d-479b-a8d7-b734770aed3f-2
00:46:24.476 --> 00:46:25.470
sailing through here.

a2484796-c0e9-484b-bd3f-24f66029dead-0
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.640
And now it's it's come out and
it's back into daylight and.

ecf1cdad-c1a7-4668-a05c-105e67fc91b7-0
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:40.282
There are narwhals with us
striped horns and blowing water

ecf1cdad-c1a7-4668-a05c-105e67fc91b7-1
00:46:40.282 --> 00:46:45.028
out of its nostrils, and it's
it's flooding the boat and

ecf1cdad-c1a7-4668-a05c-105e67fc91b7-2
00:46:45.028 --> 00:46:46.860
filling it with water.

f861945c-bd90-49d1-baf6-7be01beb9b91-0
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.701
And the boat sails on and
approaches a beach where a fish

f861945c-bd90-49d1-baf6-7be01beb9b91-1
00:46:54.701 --> 00:46:56.010
creature with.

3086b9b1-ac6f-41ad-aed3-5ec329781c8c-0
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.395
With fins that look like wings
and flippered feet and um spots.

3086b9b1-ac6f-41ad-aed3-5ec329781c8c-1
00:47:01.395 --> 00:47:05.260
Standing on a beach that has
litter and bottles and.

8fa30b90-2f2f-4dc6-a871-718185e95238-0
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.900
Different things on it.

4ba278e6-62ac-4ac1-a163-b0d059212e6e-0
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:17.795
And now the boat is sinking down
into the water. There are

4ba278e6-62ac-4ac1-a163-b0d059212e6e-1
00:47:17.795 --> 00:47:23.613
jellyfish floating all around
with their jellyfish design and

4ba278e6-62ac-4ac1-a163-b0d059212e6e-2
00:47:23.613 --> 00:47:28.680
their little feet kind of
flapping in a huge striped.

b1ca471b-8e75-467d-baa1-3db962c72d1a-0
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.359
Creature that's different from
the other Jelly feet fish is

b1ca471b-8e75-467d-baa1-3db962c72d1a-1
00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:34.560
approaching the boat.

405db492-7174-4356-b000-f9b105010791-0
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.945
And the book continues to fall
past the school of fish. It's

405db492-7174-4356-b000-f9b105010791-1
00:47:41.945 --> 00:47:44.970
getting it's it's deeper and
deeper. It's getting dark.

f82b6682-d865-45c8-aa4c-1aba0423a0cc-0
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:49.960
And, um, the creatures are
getting hotter and glow.

21d97337-ac69-4f0a-85fb-b502840131e2-0
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.150
Under the the dark water.

9c9ff48b-abb9-47e9-8db5-5d6e79f581f9-0
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:58.550
Um.

e8652abf-cabd-43e2-96f5-eb8d99db7343-0
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.470
And.

c85e80a4-1137-44a4-957b-68ead1983915-0
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.310
Till it lands on.

3a181f47-afd6-4cba-9b68-34c35b5516bd-0
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.974
Um, looks like it's landed on
something, and some creatures

3a181f47-afd6-4cba-9b68-34c35b5516bd-1
00:48:07.974 --> 00:48:08.190
are.

4eeb5dc9-b8af-4c22-b61f-fb4c607146da-0
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.750
Or crawling on it and sitting in
it and checking it out and

4eeb5dc9-b8af-4c22-b61f-fb4c607146da-1
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:16.868
there's a bright light and all
of a sudden a submarine. The the

4eeb5dc9-b8af-4c22-b61f-fb4c607146da-2
00:48:16.868 --> 00:48:19.120
boat is on the end of a
submarine.

39b12b88-d8af-4931-a4f7-914dd098c19b-0
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.690
That is.

bb1793ef-8238-4b4a-bbc6-581f8efd6817-0
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.920
It's swimming up from the depths
and comes out of the water.

34593266-e7d4-453f-b3fc-1466c6eefd3f-0
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.440


6ee45385-1d9c-4ecb-8aaa-ffc053ff500c-0
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:34.360
You know, and the the boat pours
out the water that that was

6ee45385-1d9c-4ecb-8aaa-ffc053ff500c-1
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.200
stuck in it.

55f392eb-96fc-44f0-b347-0309ba5637c7-0
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:36.680
Umm.

de5cf26f-d7db-4ba3-8338-d3fb19f017a7-0
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:40.240
And so it's it's up out of the
water and.

0e37dce8-c0d1-405f-adf2-5f51fa858036-0
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.116
There's a big sea creature
latching on to another sailing

0e37dce8-c0d1-405f-adf2-5f51fa858036-1
00:48:45.116 --> 00:48:49.237
boat. It looks like it's trying
to pull it into the water and

0e37dce8-c0d1-405f-adf2-5f51fa858036-2
00:48:49.237 --> 00:48:50.900
the boat is sailing free.

0b36dff6-ff99-4b2c-ae9f-a24d77064a67-0
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:59.797
Um, now some walruses. Um are
playing with the boat and

0b36dff6-ff99-4b2c-ae9f-a24d77064a67-1
00:48:59.797 --> 00:49:04.823
balancing on its on their noses
as others roll around and play

0b36dff6-ff99-4b2c-ae9f-a24d77064a67-2
00:49:04.823 --> 00:49:06.100
with each other.

12b3ddd2-3d6f-4433-b1ff-a14f68d16ca7-0
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:18.311
And then the boat sails passed.
What sort of fish and jellyfish

12b3ddd2-3d6f-4433-b1ff-a14f68d16ca7-1
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:21.800
and sea fronds and over top of?

d396d894-57d1-42e1-93e6-8e7cf969cf2d-0
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:27.351
And another diver who's inside a
big clam has the the clam wedged

d396d894-57d1-42e1-93e6-8e7cf969cf2d-1
00:49:27.351 --> 00:49:30.740
open and is taking the Pearl out
of the clam.

e4c32868-8457-4271-b0e0-944fff9addc2-0
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.400
or oyster.

e2b973be-900d-4426-9140-2204073d999e-0
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:40.010
And now there's a lighthouse
with a a buoy um that the boat

e2b973be-900d-4426-9140-2204073d999e-1
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.340
is sailing passed and the diver
is riding on on sea creature.

7b9e4798-44a4-434e-b8df-98637d050a27-0
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.890
And into looks like a port with
a really long.

f20562d8-c388-419b-a87d-8902b4d07cfb-0
00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.260
Long dock and there's sailing
vessels.

ee88a9ca-601a-4104-b003-b8615720dea6-0
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.960
And big, big ships with with
huge sails.

d4161170-458f-4a67-864a-ff9754a14d0d-0
00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:11.500
And this little bit is running
past these, these boats that are

d4161170-458f-4a67-864a-ff9754a14d0d-1
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.861
way bigger than it. A sailboat
and a tugboat and an even huger

d4161170-458f-4a67-864a-ff9754a14d0d-2
00:50:15.861 --> 00:50:19.668
boat. It's just gigantic and you
can see a town in the

There's a shadow of Dragon's
tail on the wall.

91069dc6-c0f9-4a3e-928c-865b3dad49e5-0
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.320
The girl looks up.

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.811
They've arrived at a train
station and the train is pulling

544bea36-0571-46f5-8572-38951416e699-1
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:48.632

Their luggage, and the dad puts
his hand on his daughter's

de387d88-11e5-4558-9d35-81ccde44d3c2-1

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.244
And to show her there's a paper
crane hiding underneath, and he

64195bbc-b256-40e0-b806-5e363985f973-1
01:02:00.244 --> 01:02:01.110
gives it to her.

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:05.570
And she admires it, and gives
him a hug. And.

3f4b8eb1-406b-41ee-8c90-f73b31acc26e-0
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:11.570

And he's whispering something in
her ear, and then he takes his.

06a5de2e-32da-48db-8b35-80c8871332cb-0
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:21.420
Trunk and he steps up on the
train.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:26.288
And he's holding the hand,
holding the hand of his wife and

4fd1b117-1fdb-4bb0-88ff-a3cb5f912c58-1

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.370
You know their hands pull away
as as the train pulls away and

6d9b8c59-5429-4c68-8e39-210bbe4e80cc-1
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:36.330

the trunk and the dad's having a

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:01.081
At a small circular window,
which turns out to be the

1db9241c-04ba-4d96-b5d4-b02924047d87-1
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:01.470

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.403
In a large
vessel, he's on a big ship

e40d6d82-9504-4322-abdd-2265e673d6ef-1
01:03:05.403 --> 01:03:08.663
sailing in the ocean, so he's
gone from a train to a to a ship

e40d6d82-9504-4322-abdd-2265e673d6ef-2
01:03:08.663 --> 01:03:10.320

Complex scene.

the deep sea divers.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.404
Then Waldo and Wizard White
Beard came to the watery world

66d8de24-8277-40bc-a14c-951a23e54581-1
01:04:38.404 --> 01:04:41.163
of the deep sea divers, where
many waldos had been before, and

01:04:41.163 --> 01:04:43.791
Waldo searched for the 8th

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.419
Among the mermaids, fishermen
and fish. And when he found it,

65ba99b5-28b5-46b3-9a3a-ee851275d7f2-1
01:04:47.419 --> 01:04:49.180

It's a city street and there's a

the mom is in the kitchen

01:08:27.022 --> 01:08:30.307

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:33.820
computer working, and she's just
sitting there looking bored.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.898
And she's standing next to her
mom, but the mom's busy cooking

9d110acd-9506-4b3c-a3f5-497b26bdc249-1
01:08:46.898 --> 01:08:49.330
and on the phone, so next she
goes to her dad.

41e404a4-3ea7-4037-a6f3-28efe02b0215-0
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.150

staring at the screen.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:56.208
And she goes and ohh she's got a
kite. It looks like he doesn't,

24a38b6d-0f62-4397-a701-982225c4baf3-1
01:08:56.208 --> 01:08:58.680

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:02.647
And then she's got a red ball
and she's hanging over the couch

ce295587-df60-4fac-b0bb-4e68a0eb6cb1-1
01:09:02.647 --> 01:09:04.460

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:08.507
Busy, um, you know, on her
phone. And so she just goes to

6145b378-2ff7-4418-8b3a-fd15f9a52572-1
01:09:08.507 --> 01:09:11.925
her room and she's sitting
there, bored as the cat sleeps

6145b378-2ff7-4418-8b3a-fd15f9a52572-2
01:09:11.925 --> 01:09:12.750
in the corner.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.350
And then she notices.

f6a8edb1-1078-4178-a785-6393460301b3-0
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.120
A piece of red chalk on the
floor.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.810

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.940
Draws a doorway in the wall, and
the door opens and she walks

00709014-7764-4b18-ad98-8ab16075be8d-1
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.390
through.

ffdb99d0-e2f5-487f-a733-e1a50de642b9-0
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:38.782
And out into a magical forest
with a stream and tall trees

ffdb99d0-e2f5-487f-a733-e1a50de642b9-1
01:09:38.782 --> 01:09:39.140
and.

27b762c4-aa58-4bfd-9a0e-a57e38713a19-0
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:43.991
Lantern like Chinese lanterns
hung from the trees and lights

27b762c4-aa58-4bfd-9a0e-a57e38713a19-1
01:09:43.991 --> 01:09:44.940
strung around.

85fe761b-1153-4673-a018-b2816cc8c0f3-0
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.446
And she walks um off. There's a
small wooden dock off the

85fe761b-1153-4673-a018-b2816cc8c0f3-1
01:09:53.446 --> 01:09:58.165
stream, and she walks to the
edge of the dock and leans down

85fe761b-1153-4673-a018-b2816cc8c0f3-2
01:09:58.165 --> 01:10:03.039
into the water and draws herself
a boat. And now she's sailing

85fe761b-1153-4673-a018-b2816cc8c0f3-3
01:10:03.039 --> 01:10:05.670
away from the dock on a red
boat.

fb522316-0cc7-491b-ae31-948c3871023a-0
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:15.428
And follows the stream to a huge
castle that's that's in the

fb522316-0cc7-491b-ae31-948c3871023a-1
01:10:15.428 --> 01:10:17.980
river with turrets and domes
and.

50febfb5-c59b-42de-977a-d2a6d044bf88-0
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:20.840
It's this huge fortress.

9c8ee213-ba5d-4731-a1ad-4e0657ebb989-0
01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:29.537
And she sails up a channel, and
the soldiers are waving to her

9c8ee213-ba5d-4731-a1ad-4e0657ebb989-1
01:10:29.537 --> 01:10:30.250
hello, and.

eeb6eef0-2856-49f4-86c1-9d46e6f8c0b3-0
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:34.285
She like there are all these
water, water channels through

eeb6eef0-2856-49f4-86c1-9d46e6f8c0b3-1
01:10:34.285 --> 01:10:35.670
the city that she can travel.

9ee63500-a02a-4bc6-8f22-47fafb9c9128-0
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.932
Only she gets to the end and
there's a big waterfall and as

9ee63500-a02a-4bc6-8f22-47fafb9c9128-1
01:10:42.932 --> 01:10:45.736
the boat is about to fall and
she's falling through, but

9ee63500-a02a-4bc6-8f22-47fafb9c9128-2
01:10:45.736 --> 01:10:48.934
starts to fall and she's falling
through there and she starts to

9ee63500-a02a-4bc6-8f22-47fafb9c9128-3
01:10:48.934 --> 01:10:49.820
draw a big circle.

398e48f3-deb2-45b4-bf1c-c972ea6b533b-0
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:57.073
And it turns and turns it into a
hot air balloon and she's

398e48f3-deb2-45b4-bf1c-c972ea6b533b-1
01:10:57.073 --> 01:10:59.720
sailing away and the soldiers
are waving by to her.

a2c1d18c-3b35-4480-b183-8caa6e555873-0
01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.188
Um, as she's sailing, she
there's a big airship or big

a2c1d18c-3b35-4480-b183-8caa6e555873-1
01:11:04.188 --> 01:11:05.940
airships in the background.

900c4658-22d1-4c25-9ef5-6f09733ee229-0
01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:15.045
And she notices that one of
these airships has someone

900c4658-22d1-4c25-9ef5-6f09733ee229-1
01:11:15.045 --> 01:11:19.437
directing soldiers to reach out
with a net and try to catch a

900c4658-22d1-4c25-9ef5-6f09733ee229-2
01:11:19.437 --> 01:11:22.200
purple bird with a long tail
feathers.

b53ea986-5c58-456c-b593-e090bb92844f-0
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:30.694
And she sails closer to the ohh
the they've caught the bird and

b53ea986-5c58-456c-b593-e090bb92844f-1
01:11:30.694 --> 01:11:34.376
they have it in a cage, and
she's sailing closer to this big

b53ea986-5c58-456c-b593-e090bb92844f-2
01:11:34.376 --> 01:11:34.860
airship.

f68b0501-a6f7-41d2-b668-f723843b1bf0-0
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:41.759
And she lands her balloon on the
airship and runs for the door

f68b0501-a6f7-41d2-b668-f723843b1bf0-1
01:11:41.759 --> 01:11:45.114
and climbs the tower to where
the bird is. The Purple bird is

f68b0501-a6f7-41d2-b668-f723843b1bf0-2
01:11:45.114 --> 01:11:46.630
being kept in a golden cage.

2296d7d0-4e04-4bb3-a88a-2b6d45108fb5-0
01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.776
She grabs the cage and runs, and
the soldiers are surprised and

2296d7d0-4e04-4bb3-a88a-2b6d45108fb5-1
01:11:54.776 --> 01:11:58.862
run after her. She runs to the
edge of the airship, opens the

2296d7d0-4e04-4bb3-a88a-2b6d45108fb5-2
01:11:58.862 --> 01:12:01.300
cage, and sets the Purple Bird
free.

cdc84cbe-3561-42ab-a6e1-1392bb2f5037-0
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:08.572
But the soldiers grabbed her and
the their commander drops the

cdc84cbe-3561-42ab-a6e1-1392bb2f5037-1
01:12:08.572 --> 01:12:12.175
piece of red shock off the
airship. And so now she's

cdc84cbe-3561-42ab-a6e1-1392bb2f5037-2
01:12:12.175 --> 01:12:16.390
trapped in her own cage, hanging
off the back of the airship.

2fce8c6e-16d2-4d6b-bba2-53c59e43ca94-0
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.868
But the purple bird, uh, has
caught the the red chalk and

2fce8c6e-16d2-4d6b-bba2-53c59e43ca94-1
01:12:25.868 --> 01:12:27.580
flies in to save her.

3bf5f67b-22e0-440d-abf2-f9aebaed8e8a-0
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:32.977
And um, as the bird sits on her
shoulders, she starts to draw a

3bf5f67b-22e0-440d-abf2-f9aebaed8e8a-1
01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:33.700
rectangle.

6321494b-3526-489d-9370-6b9c65cc29cd-0
01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:43.386
And she finishes a a carpet
which turns into a magic flying

6321494b-3526-489d-9370-6b9c65cc29cd-1
01:12:43.386 --> 01:12:48.694
carpet that's red, and she flies
out of her cage, following the

6321494b-3526-489d-9370-6b9c65cc29cd-2
01:12:48.694 --> 01:12:49.690
Purple bird.

b8938924-812a-4c47-b51a-d464259504d0-0
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:58.250
And they fly off through the
night, um, and over the desert

b8938924-812a-4c47-b51a-d464259504d0-1
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.780
single palm tree.

ebda745e-47cb-4b57-b42f-9a5d319eca31-0
01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:07.201
And they land and they come up
to the palm tree and she notices

ebda745e-47cb-4b57-b42f-9a5d319eca31-1
01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:10.166
that there's a purple door, a
small purple door in that palm

ebda745e-47cb-4b57-b42f-9a5d319eca31-2
01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:10.410
tree.

9d5de966-0dbf-456a-b600-b07d62c07586-0
01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.419
Which she opens and the bird
flies through, and then she

9d5de966-0dbf-456a-b600-b07d62c07586-1
01:13:14.419 --> 01:13:15.290
crawls after it.

b7452294-4f34-4c45-97bb-1386587f586f-0
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:22.673
And out into the cityscape where
she runs into the bird is flying

b7452294-4f34-4c45-97bb-1386587f586f-1
01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:26.010
towards a boy, the boy who was
holding something.

c17d46ea-4307-432b-b4ce-b64ffe0cd628-0
01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.550
And it turns out it's a piece of
purple chalk.

6af24f1a-eb29-40aa-8425-08632edc74a7-0
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:33.738
And so, um, he introduces her to
his bird, and she draws a red

6af24f1a-eb29-40aa-8425-08632edc74a7-1
01:13:33.738 --> 01:13:36.410
circle, and he draws a purple
circle.

48e0b915-2f87-4400-9af3-e253dca8b910-0
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.340
And together they finish a
bicycle.

9b08a416-9b7b-45d7-bf36-7114f8dff66d-0
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.252
That they can use
to ride through the city while

9b08a416-9b7b-45d7-bf36-7114f8dff66d-1
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:43.960
the bird follows them. #END_journey

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:52.645
I like that one. I've heard
that one with my son. Yeah,

84a08389-e0d3-4f3f-89fe-ae546760ced3-1
01:13:52.645 --> 01:13:54.380
that's a good one. Or Reddit.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.970
OK, next we have a complex
scene.

01479727-ba77-452c-893f-c9ae665582e6-0
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:09.040

these yet.

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:15.650
Wait one second.

806739c9-4652-4bc7-be7e-b324b11afdb1-0
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.700
OK, here we go.

3b7989a4-15f7-4c60-b39f-10dbeea8e4a9-0
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:31.920
#START_being_a_pirate OK, all
right. We have an animated

3b7989a4-15f7-4c60-b39f-10dbeea8e4a9-1
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.175
drawing of an ocean with a
pirate ship and and a beach and

3b7989a4-15f7-4c60-b39f-10dbeea8e4a9-2
01:14:36.175 --> 01:14:40.357
a little book that tells us 250
years ago being a pirate.

3b7989a4-15f7-4c60-b39f-10dbeea8e4a9-3
01:14:40.357 --> 01:14:41.799
Shroomy Timbers and.

01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:44.960
As we discover this pirate scene
and.

c122ad44-0966-4e09-903e-b131e70f1a9f-0
01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:50.010
we have a huge like 3 masted
pirate ship in the ocean with.

9cb62422-4151-45da-9e3f-69960f6fa954-0
01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.860
Cannons firing and.

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:58.530
People climbing all over the the
deck and the.

0ec7bda4-0344-4648-bc27-c961ccbcf0e9-0
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:03.972
You know the the lines and the
rigging and there are smaller

0ec7bda4-0344-4648-bc27-c961ccbcf0e9-1
01:15:03.972 --> 01:15:04.680
boots like.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.268
Smaller groups of pirates on on
small row boats and they're all

18f22c45-b10d-4eea-8fb8-605dd4a27ee9-1
01:15:10.268 --> 01:15:10.810
packed in.

86bf5732-4d0c-4768-92c1-9020981e1f5a-0
01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:15.300
One of them has the black and
white skull and crossbones,

86bf5732-4d0c-4768-92c1-9020981e1f5a-1
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.252
Jolly Roger flag, and one has
broken in half and is sinking

86bf5732-4d0c-4768-92c1-9020981e1f5a-2
01:15:19.252 --> 01:15:19.450

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.563
Um, there are waves all around
and there's an octopus grabbing

ebf69e8b-5cf6-4e96-b706-f5f414f845e2-1
01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:26.200
people and throwing them.

01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:28.530
There's.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.460
Um, another fancier pirate ship
nearby

5c473b4e-3df7-4b81-9694-247d26e877e6-0
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.790

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.340
And a bunch of looks like maybe
they're all.

466ec7df-afb0-4011-b281-7f85a501e0fa-0
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.530
Well, some of them are. Some of
the boats are sailing to the.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.345
Uh, to the beach where people
were digging and there's people

58bd1714-347d-43ac-8dc2-e583b4fae53b-1
01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:50.650
carrying chests and.

Uh, palm trees and um.

f686adcb-5dda-45b7-a5ed-66eb1783b477-0
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:57.480
A Cliff.

3e3a663c-762f-4da8-805f-34e8432d483e-0
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.050
And um.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:05.037

Looks like there's some other
fish in the water and people are

f30d381d-05ad-4110-8a08-3348c193ae1f-1
01:16:40.399 --> 01:16:43.030

OK, here we go.

65851bed-325b-44c5-bd36-ed0dbda6bf74-0
01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.667
#START_campsite OK, we have a
postcard from Waldo that says

65851bed-325b-44c5-bd36-ed0dbda6bf74-1
01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:48.924

65851bed-325b-44c5-bd36-ed0dbda6bf74-2
01:17:48.924 --> 01:17:51.229
flowers painted all over a tent
or a line of?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.918
Hikers running along the country
lanes I have today. It was just

a552fe30-7969-4c27-82b5-6aa291a067a6-1
01:17:54.918 --> 01:17:57.747
amazing to Waldo friends. North
of the South Pole. East of the

a552fe30-7969-4c27-82b5-6aa291a067a6-2
01:17:57.747 --> 01:17:58.690
West Pole, the world.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:10.100
Looks like a river or canal
flowing through the countryside.

4b654396-1697-4836-b274-44a1bab3aabf-0
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:15.364
Um, there are streets and
sidewalks and people camping.

01:18:15.364 --> 01:18:17.210
There's a ton of tents.

3397327d-bdd5-45f1-9247-e63cc8fabf9e-0
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:23.195
Like big wall tents and little
smaller just triangle tents.

3397327d-bdd5-45f1-9247-e63cc8fabf9e-1
01:18:23.195 --> 01:18:27.770
Most of them are playing, but
there's one with flowers and.

ab410f33-15e3-4ec6-98af-29b4e3766c0d-0
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:31.770
So looks like something like a
like a hippie tent.

5b913cf9-3391-4ce0-a7e7-c7a33638a656-0
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:35.655

01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:46.886
They're in the canal. There's a
boats with people sailing and

6a162f02-14ca-4a60-aa9d-3bb0c83e36e4-1
01:18:46.886 --> 01:18:48.660
fish people fishing.

b39e9038-d6ef-46aa-9de8-517d18c5c72f-0
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:52.650
Um, couple of mermaids.

8424acb1-9530-496d-bd4e-05557755011a-0
01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:56.898
A bridge connecting the two
sides of the the river. It's

8424acb1-9530-496d-bd4e-05557755011a-1
01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.680
like an arched bridge that
people are walking over.

4d788970-6fc9-4a2c-8c73-5c9882e8e03e-0
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.140
And one of the fields are a
couple of bulls and someone's.

65cf77ee-b007-4240-a4b4-310fcfe7657a-0
01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.904
Waving a piece of, you know, red
flag in front of a bull, he's

65cf77ee-b007-4240-a4b4-310fcfe7657a-1
01:19:09.904 --> 01:19:11.960
sort of storming towards him.

215ff916-50da-4a46-ad1b-970c03033127-0
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.660
Um.

Hikers.

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:22.060
With walking staffs and
backpacks, and some of them are.

99108279-2fea-4e1f-b87c-b43434e4ebdc-0
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.671
They look like they're really
tired. They're like crawling on

99108279-2fea-4e1f-b87c-b43434e4ebdc-1
01:19:25.671 --> 01:19:26.160
the ground.

821ce1ff-92bf-4716-b5c0-cd41cebe8b18-0
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:29.610
Like, maybe they're exhausted.

dc92f589-1be4-46db-9c45-56bb2916b007-0
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:35.325
On the other side of the river
are people with motorhomes and

dc92f589-1be4-46db-9c45-56bb2916b007-1
01:19:35.325 --> 01:19:35.720
RV's.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.577
Some are big, some. Some have a
single wheel, some have double

666d2169-1424-4b61-b75c-dcc24b432e69-1
01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.010
wheels.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.170
There's a red and white striped
awning.

77ffd3a9-9238-4670-8584-b519cac9c23e-0
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:50.520
Um, ton of people walking.
There's like a Boy Scout troop.

eb6174ef-790e-4170-9fc4-e207ceec61b6-0

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.440
There are, you know, kids in
their uniforms saluting.

82329c1f-a590-46c4-a69c-fde3e4ee8301-0
01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.829
There's 1 1 trailer with a bunch
of smoke coming out of it. Maybe

82329c1f-a590-46c4-a69c-fde3e4ee8301-1
01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:03.450
somebody's burning something.

b5ab0e65-47c2-48af-9126-a83e2c3a8f57-0
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.550
There's people riding bikes and
normal bicycles. One person has

b5ab0e65-47c2-48af-9126-a83e2c3a8f57-1
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:12.475
like a bicycle with a huge
wheel, like one of the old old

b5ab0e65-47c2-48af-9126-a83e2c3a8f57-2
01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:13.489
timey bicycles.

b065a920-809e-422f-93d7-17516b11a512-0
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:15.350
Umm.

01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:21.287
And someone has a dog on a
leash, um, and in the background

b4f3989d-165b-4e0f-bba5-c61840b0632f-1
01:20:21.287 --> 01:20:22.740
is like countryside.

b611c05f-0382-4bc6-b324-d2d15a5a7120-0
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.170
And the other pool chasing some
people, but a lot of fields.

99148e44-3f9b-423b-9dbb-2ba2a47a7224-0
01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.490
With trees in between for
boundaries.

0ee67abd-0aca-4fad-85fe-edfe61b3f3d3-0
01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.240
Umm.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.340
And you know a lot of the other.

84070390-ade2-49dc-a060-b62e1b20f715-0
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.370
But there's also hedge
boundaries everywhere.

0781099d-f27d-44ae-aba8-820777c2815e-0
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.610
Um, to separate these different sections. #END_campsite 

cda4f31e-34e8-41ac-b23d-e1ee46f5d8a5-0
01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:00.950
OK, next one's also a complex
scene.

8185ed61-1158-4259-b758-f3e699d1602b-0
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.770
OK.

0fb05c21-59fb-4fbb-bbd3-2dd384ad33d1-0
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.800
#START_make_a_splash Oh, this is
a water park.

e7e0acf8-daa1-4519-8352-0bf4947c9af4-0
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:43.048
Um, it says, making a splash.
Ever since Peewee and Snowflake

e7e0acf8-daa1-4519-8352-0bf4947c9af4-1
01:21:43.048 --> 01:21:45.647
spotted the bright wiggly slides
in the distance, they've been

e7e0acf8-daa1-4519-8352-0bf4947c9af4-2
01:21:45.647 --> 01:21:48.330
pestering Amelia to let them go
to the water park. Now the whole

e7e0acf8-daa1-4519-8352-0bf4947c9af4-3
01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:50.805
family is enjoying splashing
around. Amy is busy organizing

e7e0acf8-daa1-4519-8352-0bf4947c9af4-4
01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:53.199
fun games for everyone, while
Brian is trying to find the

e7e0acf8-daa1-4519-8352-0bf4947c9af4-5
01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:55.510
courage to fight his fear fights
and go down the giant.

750ab6ff-76b0-4536-a4b5-65631e5c99d0-0
01:21:56.930 --> 01:22:00.230
Giant flume, can you pick out
all 10 Penguins?

e944fa08-2817-42cc-8022-a9481e3f3f48-0
01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:06.687
Um, so this water park has a ton
of slides dumping out into a

e944fa08-2817-42cc-8022-a9481e3f3f48-1
01:22:06.687 --> 01:22:07.550
huge pool.

0b69f8b2-a394-4a49-be66-d959e67d7d4a-0
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.914
Um, there are slides in a
rainbow formation, like wavy

0b69f8b2-a394-4a49-be66-d959e67d7d4a-1
01:22:12.914 --> 01:22:17.949
slides. Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, purple. And then

0b69f8b2-a394-4a49-be66-d959e67d7d4a-2
01:22:17.949 --> 01:22:21.620
there are some larger ones that
have like.

91c83757-f90a-4db7-a874-d1c5fbd8c8fe-0
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.671
Like they're they're enclosed
and so people can slide through

91c83757-f90a-4db7-a874-d1c5fbd8c8fe-1
01:22:27.671 --> 01:22:31.022
the tunnels and they're they're
windy. There's a red one that

91c83757-f90a-4db7-a874-d1c5fbd8c8fe-2
01:22:31.022 --> 01:22:34.374
loops around and goes under a
yellow one and a green one that

91c83757-f90a-4db7-a874-d1c5fbd8c8fe-3
01:22:34.374 --> 01:22:36.050
loops in between the other two.

3c225d39-d969-4135-96b1-cca42bc164c2-0
01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.260
Um, there's a big pirate ship.

c9792e12-301d-4f34-868f-669f2c6ca601-0
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.813
In the center of the pool, the
kids can play on and there's a

c9792e12-301d-4f34-868f-669f2c6ca601-1
01:22:42.813 --> 01:22:45.550
yellow slide that they can come
down off of that.

f9a3639c-34f6-47fa-82a6-43859e4ac047-0
01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.700
You can climb the rigging like a
