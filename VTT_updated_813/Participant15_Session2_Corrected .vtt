cdc594fe-4776-49fc-bb53-fb06d8a3466f-0
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.983
So again, in the norming study
you may see one single picture,

cdc594fe-4776-49fc-bb53-fb06d8a3466f-1
00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:14.422
a complex scene where I would
ask you to take between three

cdc594fe-4776-49fc-bb53-fb06d8a3466f-2
00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:18.416
and five minutes to describe
what you see and what is

cdc594fe-4776-49fc-bb53-fb06d8a3466f-3
00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:19.230
happening.

4829eba3-b4ab-4fa9-9e40-fd83466ba03e-0
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.680
Yeah, let me get my watch
here.

80e9deda-8b43-4d35-8a82-edecd65d5e02-0
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.860
And I will let you know when
it's about 3 minutes.

b8f3fb6f-ae25-4222-a77f-163a881af374-0
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.940
As you go through your
description.

1aef4636-a905-4f77-9a87-eedc88946f91-0
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.340
Here's this item here.

6da2bdf8-27c8-4cc7-8b01-89471ec948b6-0
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.795
#START_airport OK, so we're
looking at a where's Waldo Scene

6da2bdf8-27c8-4cc7-8b01-89471ec948b6-1
00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.800
of the airport. So we're looking
at airplanes and many, many

6da2bdf8-27c8-4cc7-8b01-89471ec948b6-2
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.609
people lined up. Some look like
they're lined up to leave

6da2bdf8-27c8-4cc7-8b01-89471ec948b6-3
00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.630
luggage to check their luggage
or their trip.

c3c7cda9-2817-4986-8ba2-226f918865b0-0
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.541
Some people are going through
the security line to have their

c3c7cda9-2817-4986-8ba2-226f918865b0-1
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:09.752
clothing looked at and I see one
man looks like he has knives

c3c7cda9-2817-4986-8ba2-226f918865b0-2
00:01:09.752 --> 00:01:15.215
inside his coat, so I'm not sure
what's going on there. I do see

c3c7cda9-2817-4986-8ba2-226f918865b0-3
00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:19.670
luggage being taken on to a it
looks like a luggage.

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-0
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.886
Graph type of situation. Some
people in the airport are coming

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-1
00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:30.617
and some people are leaving. So
we have an airplane. It looks

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-2
00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:35.042
like people are coming off of
the airplane and people are

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-3
00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:39.696
working for the airline and
taking luggage and bringing them

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-4
00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:44.274
to the airport so that people
can collect their luggage. We

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-5
00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:48.699
have it looks like lots of
little planes and large planes

85eeeea3-39ba-4c8a-b379-d5463c4fef37-6
00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:51.370
in this at this airport and
buses.

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-0
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.205
Various buses doing different
things. Some buses are bringing

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-1
00:01:56.205 --> 00:02:00.176
gas to the air airplane, some
are bringing food to the

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-2
00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:04.508
airplane. I see also some air
airplanes that have taken off

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-3
00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:08.911
already and that are in the sky
and we have various ones. In

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-4
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:13.532
this picture we actually have a
dirigible which is fascinating.

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-5
00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:18.080
And we have again small planes
and large planes in the air. We

e8601a58-fba5-4da0-8293-bae4f03f23d9-6
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.690
have a hot air balloon in the
background we have.

947f6c53-ddf0-442d-a0c8-8c9a44c06b67-0
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.324
So many people, let's see, we
actually have elephants getting

947f6c53-ddf0-442d-a0c8-8c9a44c06b67-1
00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:28.477
on a plane. That's a fascinating
thing going on in the

947f6c53-ddf0-442d-a0c8-8c9a44c06b67-2
00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:31.572
background. Ohh, let's see.
We've got the air traffic

947f6c53-ddf0-442d-a0c8-8c9a44c06b67-3
00:02:31.572 --> 00:02:35.012
control tower and the people
working in the tower directing

947f6c53-ddf0-442d-a0c8-8c9a44c06b67-4
00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:35.700
the flights.

c879d715-7645-4062-8865-c768ca42ca1b-0
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.800
It looks like we have a
spaceship off in the corner.

19376570-7d50-405d-bcd3-d6c52ac9ff95-0
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.644
And people getting on buses to
be transported to other places.

19376570-7d50-405d-bcd3-d6c52ac9ff95-1
00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:50.461
We also have see, I'm looking
around here. There's so much to

19376570-7d50-405d-bcd3-d6c52ac9ff95-2
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:54.966
see in this. Where's Waldo
picture we have. It looks like

19376570-7d50-405d-bcd3-d6c52ac9ff95-3
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.210
some people are.

2289d71a-e85b-416f-b416-0634515e2163-0
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.807
Jumping out of the airplane.
Maybe there is some sort of

2289d71a-e85b-416f-b416-0634515e2163-1
00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:03.883
emergency going on there.
Unfortunately, it looks like

2289d71a-e85b-416f-b416-0634515e2163-2
00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:07.575
they're getting hurt jumping off
the plane instead of getting off

2289d71a-e85b-416f-b416-0634515e2163-3
00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:08.470
of some sort of.

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-0
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.447
The strip, but they're just
falling out of the plane, so I

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-1
00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:19.309
have no idea what that's all
about. It looks like there's a

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-2
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.978
fire truck that's spreading
water on some people. Again,

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-3
00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:27.097
there's some weird things going
on in this situation. It's not.

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-4
00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:30.445
I don't believe this is a
typical airport situation

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-5
00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:34.178
because a lot of people are
standing on the tarmac and in

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-6
00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:37.782
this day and age that is not
usually what happens at an

9e9d7eac-470e-4054-b67e-d0123265ca6b-7
00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:40.100
airport. You're usually going
down.

c5d85fd5-a78f-4e08-9089-5f0f76614ba9-0
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.537
jetway to get onto
the plane. #END_airport  Yeah, that was about

c5d85fd5-a78f-4e08-9089-5f0f76614ba9-1
00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:48.769
3 minutes. OK, I think that's it
for me then for this one. OK,

c5d85fd5-a78f-4e08-9089-5f0f76614ba9-2
00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.136
great. So moving on to the next
one, again, it's a complex scene

c5d85fd5-a78f-4e08-9089-5f0f76614ba9-3
00:03:53.136 --> 00:03:55.690
and you can start when you're
ready.

c7e3088e-fbfa-4a0c-9087-f29e5b3f4faa-0
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.540
#START_escape_from_the_zoo This
is a scene at the zoo.

aa964ecb-7136-4a88-b122-133e8e5dd330-0
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.017
And we are looking at a lot of
people visiting the zoo today

aa964ecb-7136-4a88-b122-133e8e5dd330-1
00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:14.721
and a lot of animals at the zoo.
We have a giraffe, we have a

aa964ecb-7136-4a88-b122-133e8e5dd330-2
00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.770
rhinoceros, we have a lion.

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-0
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.727
We have zebras, we have pink
flamingos, probably some animals

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-1
00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:26.063
that I don't even know what they
are exactly. I see some polar

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-2
00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:30.536
bears in the background here. I
don't know if these are ocelots.

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-3
00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:34.735
I see something with a striped
tail and I'm not sure exactly

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-4
00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:38.726
what those are. And the people
are walking all around and

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-5
00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:42.925
looking at things like Peacocks.
And also it looks like some

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-6
00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:46.848
people are running from the
rhinoceros, so something has

ff6fddb4-3e92-471c-8047-96e89470d143-7
00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:47.330
gotten.

a5d85ba8-2518-468a-aef8-bc6704a8023f-0
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.380
lose looks like and there is a
snake there too. And let's see

a5d85ba8-2518-468a-aef8-bc6704a8023f-1
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.150
what else is in the background.
I see an Anteater, an antelope.

8f2b3fb7-2993-4327-aba3-710349e3d508-0
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.600
I see a warthog.

0f85477a-bfe3-47f9-82c0-ba99b27ee557-0
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.145
I see some people feeding the
animals and I see some people

0f85477a-bfe3-47f9-82c0-ba99b27ee557-1
00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:09.586
sitting on a bench and some
people shopping and there's a

0f85477a-bfe3-47f9-82c0-ba99b27ee557-2
00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:14.105
little cafe. There is an ice
cream booth where you can get

0f85477a-bfe3-47f9-82c0-ba99b27ee557-3
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:18.623
some ice cream. I see a some
workers at the zoo. One has a

0f85477a-bfe3-47f9-82c0-ba99b27ee557-4
00:05:18.623 --> 00:05:18.930
net.

503e9e53-e021-4466-802b-3524d051fa0f-0
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.970
And it looks like one has a
camera.

f4ff5001-800a-44de-af35-33f51ff85cdb-0
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.622
And let's see, what else do I
see here? Just a lot of people

f4ff5001-800a-44de-af35-33f51ff85cdb-1
00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:32.102
just looking all around. It
looks like some Gophers coming

f4ff5001-800a-44de-af35-33f51ff85cdb-2
00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:35.519
out of a hole. I see an insect
of some sort.

817444da-c558-4c10-aeb4-dd1a91c9b9ca-0
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.870
And.

860fd360-edb3-4b39-ac6f-44d04ba7a45d-0
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.750
Let's see.

1998fc66-5bbc-4215-ac01-1e9a68627939-0
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.481
I see a man selling hot dogs and
people lining up to get

1998fc66-5bbc-4215-ac01-1e9a68627939-1
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.380
something to eat there at the
hot dog stand.

7d7f1068-0747-4876-810b-25b164c67124-0
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.640
I see.

e14035fe-5928-46e1-80c9-9f77d908a6a6-0
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.101
Looks like they're feeding
potato chips. Yeah to the

e14035fe-5928-46e1-80c9-9f77d908a6a6-1
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.832
antelope, but I'm not sure that
the antelope would like that

e14035fe-5928-46e1-80c9-9f77d908a6a6-2
00:05:57.832 --> 00:05:59.790
very much way in the background.

3e74b3b2-75e5-414e-b988-1a1ee908577c-0
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.700
I see an eagle on top of the
cafe and a couple of other

3e74b3b2-75e5-414e-b988-1a1ee908577c-1
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.030
little birds. Maybe one is a
parrot. I see an owl on top of

3e74b3b2-75e5-414e-b988-1a1ee908577c-2
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.680
the shop.

17bd9c18-01c0-4ac5-82ad-0baf5478240e-0
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.875
 And a
number of other little birds.

17bd9c18-01c0-4ac5-82ad-0baf5478240e-1
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:13.870
Not clear what those are.

94a4a24e-b06e-4ddd-b39d-f0ab2dee0632-0
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.300
And I think that's about it for
me for this picture. #END_escape_from_the_zoo

c177e2dc-e782-41f1-8148-6960f1d8dfb3-0
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.680
OK, how's my time on that one?

d1812472-1d84-4ba8-a174-c4c23207d257-0
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.910
Um, that was almost 3.

fa2d894e-46d7-4f03-b295-cabe7330ec9d-0
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.400
Yeah. OK. So the next one.

dd98e12f-cbbc-486b-adf6-5fba0a2a012f-0
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.450
It's again a complex scene.

20a48916-935a-4eff-80ea-61cc6e1e596d-0
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.427
#START_ancient_rome OK, this is
fun and games in ancient Rome,

20a48916-935a-4eff-80ea-61cc6e1e596d-1
00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:48.541
so this is a very unusual
setting for me {and it's very

20a48916-935a-4eff-80ea-61cc6e1e596d-2
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:53.021
small, so I have to get very
close to the screen here to see

20a48916-935a-4eff-80ea-61cc6e1e596d-3
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:57.796
what's going on. } Yes, it looks
like in ancient Rome the people

20a48916-935a-4eff-80ea-61cc6e1e596d-4
00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:02.424
have gathered to watch all sorts
of things going on and I have

20a48916-935a-4eff-80ea-61cc6e1e596d-5
00:07:02.424 --> 00:07:05.949
never seen anything like this,
but some people.

46cc9960-dc8e-426c-9aa9-2dcf57a9abc1-0
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.690
Are.

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-0
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.915
Carrying a chariot with a horse
on it instead of the opposite,

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-1
00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:18.620
where you would think the horse
would be carrying them. Horses

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-2
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.326
actually, on the chariot there
are a number of people fighting

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-3
00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:27.807
in different ways, some with
swords, some with large sticks

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-4
00:07:27.807 --> 00:07:32.213
or pitchforks, and there is at
least one chariot where the

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-5
00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:36.769
horses are taking a man on the
chariot around. This is a big

f6378e8a-418b-4019-ad2d-5552b50c7769-6
00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:39.160
circle, so there are, there are.

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-0
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.997
lions in this, I guess it's sort
of an arena with people all

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-1
00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:48.453
around watching this and
cheering things on. There is so

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-2
00:07:48.453 --> 00:07:53.221
much going on that I don't even
know how they would focus on

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-3
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:57.989
anything. There are leopards,
there are people killing other

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-4
00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:02.913
people with swords. There are
lions. There is a there is a man

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-5
00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:07.759
in a little swimming pool. There
is another man pouring water

65499b5f-7a07-439f-90fa-8e0ac0384287-6
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.870
into a some sort of a bowl.

91374b86-01e7-414f-9b88-0348b602c4f4-0
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.031
So many people hitting each
other in this a lots of fighting

91374b86-01e7-414f-9b88-0348b602c4f4-1
00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:17.500
going on everywhere in this
arena.

0ef08502-c55e-425f-b5bc-080f1c91a026-0
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.380
It's hard to even.

804731f4-fa53-42a7-af2e-9bc4a6b34b46-0
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.911
Imagine what this would be, that
there would be so many things

804731f4-fa53-42a7-af2e-9bc4a6b34b46-1
00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:31.028
going on. It looks like the
Lions have all gathered together

804731f4-fa53-42a7-af2e-9bc4a6b34b46-2
00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:35.483
and are making a pyramid so that
they can escape from this arena.

804731f4-fa53-42a7-af2e-9bc4a6b34b46-3
00:08:35.483 --> 00:08:39.465
And one is a few of them are
chasing people outside of the

804731f4-fa53-42a7-af2e-9bc4a6b34b46-4
00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:39.870
arena.

39bcaced-4651-49ef-82c6-c6abbe5e364e-0
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.270
Let's see. Some people are.

f4fe9ae5-2125-466a-a976-ca5a23fe029c-0
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.230
jumping into the arena from
outside, because there's a lion

f4fe9ae5-2125-466a-a976-ca5a23fe029c-1
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.242
after them, but then there's
another lion underneath them

f4fe9ae5-2125-466a-a976-ca5a23fe029c-2
00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:57.324
getting ready to eat them, it
looks like. And there are so

f4fe9ae5-2125-466a-a976-ca5a23fe029c-3
00:08:57.324 --> 00:09:01.682
many looks like there are baby
lions here. Let's see what else

f4fe9ae5-2125-466a-a976-ca5a23fe029c-4
00:09:01.682 --> 00:09:04.380
is going on. So many different
things.

4a1b4fa5-7ff1-45b5-98b3-8fb0094080c4-0
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.041
One gentleman has fallen off the
chariot and is being dragged by

4a1b4fa5-7ff1-45b5-98b3-8fb0094080c4-1
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:12.000
four horses.

3defab93-1cd3-4fc0-acf8-984215a011dd-0
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.960


e63ffe5a-0172-4e39-8980-c9d643c224ea-0
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.435
It looks like someone has
punched one person and he has

e63ffe5a-0172-4e39-8980-c9d643c224ea-1
00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:25.520
fallen down on the ground and
lost his shoes.

c1f9e270-0f48-4a6e-a979-6ff84dd8367a-0
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.121
There are
people jumping in the air. There

c1f9e270-0f48-4a6e-a979-6ff84dd8367a-1
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:32.931
are just so many people
fighting. It's unbelievable the

c1f9e270-0f48-4a6e-a979-6ff84dd8367a-2
00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:35.090
amount of fighting going on in
this arena. #END_ancient_rome 

081da313-c24d-4ac7-a1be-4d775d06b9d6-0
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.802
About 3 minutes. OK. I think
that's about it for me. Alright.

081da313-c24d-4ac7-a1be-4d775d06b9d6-1
00:09:40.802 --> 00:09:41.440
Thank you.

27a9c1f1-bffc-4ede-8fbf-9aa05210bcf4-0
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:48.294
He's going on. It's so instead
of 1 complex scenes now we will

27a9c1f1-bffc-4ede-8fbf-9aa05210bcf4-1
00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:53.491
have a series of pictures that
tell a story. And it's about

27a9c1f1-bffc-4ede-8fbf-9aa05210bcf4-2
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:58.776
five, I mean eight slides that
you will see. And please take

27a9c1f1-bffc-4ede-8fbf-9aa05210bcf4-3
00:09:58.776 --> 00:10:04.320
between 10 and 15 minutes. I'll
let you know when it's about 10

27a9c1f1-bffc-4ede-8fbf-9aa05210bcf4-4
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.099
minutes.

666ca2ed-a87b-430a-bd0c-e7c6287ed189-0
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.541
#START_arrival_4 OK, we start
with a picture of a man. It

666ca2ed-a87b-430a-bd0c-e7c6287ed189-1
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:19.655
looks like he is washing up and
shaving his face. He's holding a

666ca2ed-a87b-430a-bd0c-e7c6287ed189-2
00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:23.390
mirror and a shaver, and he has
shaving cream on his face.

a70c1346-2740-49c7-b027-80a0a78c8ae0-0
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.278
Looks like he's getting ready.
He's buttoning up his vest, he's

a70c1346-2740-49c7-b027-80a0a78c8ae0-1
00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:32.374
tying his shoes. Looks like he
has counting the money that he

a70c1346-2740-49c7-b027-80a0a78c8ae0-2
00:10:32.374 --> 00:10:35.480
has getting ready to go out, and
he's picking.

6b58bd18-ff01-49c4-8a77-8aa5a6c483da-0
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.140
up a hat to put on he's looking
at a map.

a7f6ffa3-4ed6-41b1-9238-850e8610e534-0
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.700
Looks like a map of the city.
Possibly he's opening up the map

a7f6ffa3-4ed6-41b1-9238-850e8610e534-1
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.489
and checking it out, and next to
him there is a little creature

a7f6ffa3-4ed6-41b1-9238-850e8610e534-2
00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:49.740
and this creature looks looks
like a.

e5c7f09a-975e-413f-b9af-866e4f062c12-0
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.604
Like a little tiny whale. It's
not. It's not a creature that I

e5c7f09a-975e-413f-b9af-866e4f062c12-1
00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:58.702
have ever seen before. So this
is an imaginary creature, and it

e5c7f09a-975e-413f-b9af-866e4f062c12-2
00:10:58.702 --> 00:11:02.481
looks like the man is now
heading out of the house and out

e5c7f09a-975e-413f-b9af-866e4f062c12-3
00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:06.067
on the city street with the
creature and we're seeing a

e5c7f09a-975e-413f-b9af-866e4f062c12-4
00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:07.219
scene of the city.

d64957ac-37e6-4a2d-a1a1-81d8adbb2633-0
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.280
And he's looking at the map and.

c73aac3a-a858-4d74-ac0e-4147054b044e-0
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.390
In this scene of this imaginary.

79fec4ca-8868-48e6-9c1b-1c8a5d9ba3e6-0
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.131
City, there is a lot of TiPi
type structures. They they're

79fec4ca-8868-48e6-9c1b-1c8a5d9ba3e6-1
00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:27.413
pointy on the top and it looks
like there are ships flying

79fec4ca-8868-48e6-9c1b-1c8a5d9ba3e6-2
00:11:27.413 --> 00:11:29.919
through the air. The man is.

a583c5b9-1e18-465c-905f-8af0e86439d9-0
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.428
Standing with his little
creature next to a number of

a583c5b9-1e18-465c-905f-8af0e86439d9-1
00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:39.814
other people. Some of them have
imaginary creatures with them,

a583c5b9-1e18-465c-905f-8af0e86439d9-2
00:11:39.814 --> 00:11:44.130
and it looks like he's waiting,
possibly at a subway station.

f9850d39-4da2-49a6-b970-692686de8267-0
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.030
{Ready for the next slide?}

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-0
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.881
The imaginary creatures are
making friends with each other

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-1
00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:57.717
as he is standing next to a
woman has who has another

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-2
00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:01.767
imaginary creature. So his
creature and her creature are

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-3
00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:06.171
making friends and he's starting
to speak with that woman. It

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-4
00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:10.505
looks like she's reading a book
while she's waiting and he's

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-5
00:12:10.505 --> 00:12:14.768
asking her a question about the
map and she is pointing out

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-6
00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:19.101
something on the map to him. She
is pointing to some sort of

9c18a6f4-1759-4145-b2e5-5f02f9b563fc-7
00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:19.669
robotic.

41cf5acb-479a-4964-bdbe-0d9f81efe0a2-0
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.532
creature it almost looks like a
telephone. An old-fashioned

41cf5acb-479a-4964-bdbe-0d9f81efe0a2-1
00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:25.630
telephone and.

a8c85411-cbd5-458b-ab2f-e07e9cc3d019-0
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.834
it isn't clear to me what is
going on here, but it looks like

a8c85411-cbd5-458b-ab2f-e07e9cc3d019-1
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.600
she's dialing the phone like.

6ef70731-4e4c-419d-9a07-ca9b9f6b682a-0
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.446
Machine and pulling a nod and
something comes out. So maybe

6ef70731-4e4c-419d-9a07-ca9b9f6b682a-1
00:12:38.446 --> 00:12:42.318
it's a way of buying a ticket.
Possibly. That's what it looks

6ef70731-4e4c-419d-9a07-ca9b9f6b682a-2
00:12:42.318 --> 00:12:46.190
like. she is pointing to the
ticket and handing the ticket to

6ef70731-4e4c-419d-9a07-ca9b9f6b682a-3
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.940
the man and.

2b1bf7e7-9f6a-43de-a57a-2c108ca25ff5-0
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.580
He is quoting something that
looks like a hand.

4a2e03d7-4736-432d-95fe-5d6ff6037be0-0
00:12:54.670 --> 00:13:00.642
And they're looking up into the
air, seeing some flying machines

4a2e03d7-4736-432d-95fe-5d6ff6037be0-1
00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:01.470
going by.

52422b76-e37d-4b35-80c4-8f8edfd51f2e-0
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.706
It looks like one of the flying
machines is going to stop and

52422b76-e37d-4b35-80c4-8f8edfd51f2e-1
00:13:07.706 --> 00:13:10.870
pick them up and he is getting
ready to go on to this.

2a9ee6e8-f3a1-441d-9f92-698d86cafb21-0
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.252
This method of transportation
and his ticket is being looked

2a9ee6e8-f3a1-441d-9f92-698d86cafb21-1
00:13:17.252 --> 00:13:21.510
at and the ticket taker is
allowing him to go {next week.}

5c1f2674-776e-4e38-bd75-92b96174c1ca-0
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.018
He sits down with his creature
and he's sitting next to the

5c1f2674-776e-4e38-bd75-92b96174c1ca-1
00:13:28.018 --> 00:13:32.222
woman that he had met outside
with her creature and they are.

5c1f2674-776e-4e38-bd75-92b96174c1ca-2
00:13:32.222 --> 00:13:36.493
They're talking together and he
is looking into his pocket and

5c1f2674-776e-4e38-bd75-92b96174c1ca-3
00:13:36.493 --> 00:13:40.765
getting something out. It almost
looks like a passport type of

5c1f2674-776e-4e38-bd75-92b96174c1ca-4
00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:44.630
document because it looks like
it has his picture on it.

53af72b2-d8f7-4de1-b8c0-9295bcffbff5-0
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.573
She is looking at it and she
gets out her document, which

53af72b2-d8f7-4de1-b8c0-9295bcffbff5-1
00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:52.150
again looks like a.

142699ce-6955-4280-b2bd-f75b568d283e-0
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.160
Some sort of a passport type
document with a picture and.

86fd036f-d92e-4306-92fa-80418c62d47b-0
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.020
writing

94ee9b67-6abe-49ca-a398-9d92e6038173-0
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.090
On the next, it looks like she
is.

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-0
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.417
Going back in time thinking of
something and she is thinking

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-1
00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:15.294
possibly of being, I don't know,
if she was in prison. She's

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-2
00:14:15.294 --> 00:14:19.172
reading a book, and then as
she's reading the book, somebody

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-3
00:14:19.172 --> 00:14:22.858
grabs her, takes the book and
puts it in a drawer, and it

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-4
00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:26.863
looks like they're locking her
in. I see a lock and a key, and

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-5
00:14:26.863 --> 00:14:30.740
it looks like they're locking
her in somewhere, giving her a

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-6
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.681
shovel, and making her shovel
something that looks like coal,

048bf73e-c8e6-4c66-992f-055a82e89943-7
00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:37.860
possibly into a fire. So she's
being given a job.

b36487e7-7278-46cc-9839-fefa9be1ef5f-0
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:43.670
And shoveling coal into a fire,
possibly. And she also has to.

375d452f-404d-43f7-8d46-2db1e4c283a4-0
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.105
Get on a ladder, climb up the
ladder and when the looks like

375d452f-404d-43f7-8d46-2db1e4c283a4-1
00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:56.400
when the top of the furnace gets
clogged, she has to take this.

3fadf5ca-3453-4c44-82f0-d4b0b7125064-0
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.920
Some sort of a.

1c3980eb-d80b-495e-9540-8d1b58dd7c73-0
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:05.572
Broom type item and clear out
the top of the furnace. {OK,

1c3980eb-d80b-495e-9540-8d1b58dd7c73-1
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.580
ready for the next?}

40bb3b27-af82-4d0c-b716-6ee10759b4b6-0
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.002
We then see that there are a
number of these furnaces with

40bb3b27-af82-4d0c-b716-6ee10759b4b6-1
00:15:14.002 --> 00:15:18.537
smokestacks and she is looking
over at all of these other

40bb3b27-af82-4d0c-b716-6ee10759b4b6-2
00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:23.150
people who are doing basically
the same job as her in this

40bb3b27-af82-4d0c-b716-6ee10759b4b6-3
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.870
prison type structure.

ce7e0c24-0d08-43a5-9359-67444dd98b74-0
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:31.135
She looks very dejected, and she
takes her shovel and it looks

ce7e0c24-0d08-43a5-9359-67444dd98b74-1
00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:36.300
like she's using it to open a
door, possibly to try to escape.

a0b6e16f-bd8f-42a6-a01c-a2526176b4a5-0
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.684
She is opening a drawer and
getting the book out that she

a0b6e16f-bd8f-42a6-a01c-a2526176b4a5-1
00:15:41.684 --> 00:15:46.467
that the guard had taken away
from her and she's running away

a0b6e16f-bd8f-42a6-a01c-a2526176b4a5-2
00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:51.481
with the book and it looks like
she's escaping. The next and the

a0b6e16f-bd8f-42a6-a01c-a2526176b4a5-3
00:15:51.481 --> 00:15:56.418
next scene we see her sitting in
a doorway with the book and we

a0b6e16f-bd8f-42a6-a01c-a2526176b4a5-4
00:15:56.418 --> 00:15:58.270
see a train going along.

029543b8-d3a0-4833-b5f6-eb55f6092099-0
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.170
{Next.}

7d80e8b4-3670-4c56-b610-bf57ed004131-0
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.405
In the next scene we see one of
these magical ships flying

7d80e8b4-3670-4c56-b610-bf57ed004131-1
00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:11.652
through the air, and we're back
to the man and the woman that we

7d80e8b4-3670-4c56-b610-bf57ed004131-2
00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:15.835
first started talking about with
their imaginary creatures, and

7d80e8b4-3670-4c56-b610-bf57ed004131-3
00:16:15.835 --> 00:16:19.559
we see what looks like a
conductor possibly telling them

7d80e8b4-3670-4c56-b610-bf57ed004131-4
00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:23.350
that they are to the destination
that they were going to.

0d8328c3-3b45-4fa7-99e4-0784efa660ad-0
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.250
The gentleman says goodbye to
his.

43ff2bf6-044f-4974-8821-afab5472d101-0
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.355
This woman friend and he takes
his imaginary creature and he's

43ff2bf6-044f-4974-8821-afab5472d101-1
00:16:33.355 --> 00:16:38.502
looking up into the air as if he
is in a quandary. And as he

43ff2bf6-044f-4974-8821-afab5472d101-2
00:16:38.502 --> 00:16:43.817
looks out into this imaginary
world, there are it looks like a

43ff2bf6-044f-4974-8821-afab5472d101-3
00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:44.829
city with a.

0fe4d8eb-7380-4d1c-a151-f3c3c0b72efa-0
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.328
A giant creature that he's
looking at, and it's not clear

0fe4d8eb-7380-4d1c-a151-f3c3c0b72efa-1
00:16:50.328 --> 00:16:54.155
if that is a statue or what that
is, but it's a it's a very

0fe4d8eb-7380-4d1c-a151-f3c3c0b72efa-2
00:16:54.155 --> 00:16:57.280
unusual looking city that he's
looking out into.

8a9cfbef-cc87-45a3-a97a-87db414991e2-0
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:04.068
He walks along in this city with
his pet, and there are a lot of

8a9cfbef-cc87-45a3-a97a-87db414991e2-1
00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:08.117
other people walking along the
street too. It looks like there

8a9cfbef-cc87-45a3-a97a-87db414991e2-2
00:17:08.117 --> 00:17:11.845
are some outside market and
outside marketplace with some

8a9cfbef-cc87-45a3-a97a-87db414991e2-3
00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:12.360
sort of.

5dc7402b-a682-4a41-96c4-aa4d1e89914c-0
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.400
Something that they're selling,
not sure what that is.

4d4bd20b-43e4-4f7c-b602-192f6706999e-0
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:22.177
Vegetable. Is it a creature?
It's not clear. And I see a a

4d4bd20b-43e4-4f7c-b602-192f6706999e-1
00:17:22.177 --> 00:17:22.650
woman.

9a3e46fe-ed2d-4e95-97ce-beaa2d276e5d-0
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.161
It looks like she's buying
something. It looks like

9a3e46fe-ed2d-4e95-97ce-beaa2d276e5d-1
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:32.202
somebody is selling fish. He
continues to walk along and he

9a3e46fe-ed2d-4e95-97ce-beaa2d276e5d-2
00:17:32.202 --> 00:17:36.377
is looking into what appears to
be some sort of a menu with a

9a3e46fe-ed2d-4e95-97ce-beaa2d276e5d-3
00:17:36.377 --> 00:17:40.283
foreign language, and he's
pointing to bread on the menu.

9a3e46fe-ed2d-4e95-97ce-beaa2d276e5d-4
00:17:40.283 --> 00:17:44.458
There's also fish, there's an
apple, there is milk and cheese

9a3e46fe-ed2d-4e95-97ce-beaa2d276e5d-5
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:48.229
and possibly a potato on that
menu. He's looking along.

9187c759-cd6b-4d60-9e3a-cd628e10cb83-0
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.460
Well, his imaginary creature.

77dd12b2-89c5-43b1-a64a-28aff4c2d807-0
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.969
Is checking out a wall of
drawers that have different

77dd12b2-89c5-43b1-a64a-28aff4c2d807-1
00:17:55.969 --> 00:18:00.398
things written on them and this
other language and the creature.

77dd12b2-89c5-43b1-a64a-28aff4c2d807-2
00:18:00.398 --> 00:18:04.555
His pet is looking at one drawer
which he opens and there it

77dd12b2-89c5-43b1-a64a-28aff4c2d807-3
00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:08.711
looks like it almost looks like
a strawberry. Not clear what

77dd12b2-89c5-43b1-a64a-28aff4c2d807-4
00:18:08.711 --> 00:18:12.732
that is he was looking at this
book that has a menu of all

77dd12b2-89c5-43b1-a64a-28aff4c2d807-5
00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:13.550
these items.

46fe91fd-cb96-4872-a3e5-f1beea2ee88e-0
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.130
And he picks up this strawberry
looking item.

ebc3ad7e-584f-4d2d-ba81-f22b70c77c84-0
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.658
Uh, there is another man and a
little boy there. The little boy

ebc3ad7e-584f-4d2d-ba81-f22b70c77c84-1
00:18:23.658 --> 00:18:25.720
is holding the item and.

aa91bc9b-057e-4022-b41b-db8a51a768ec-0
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.010
He is saying no, he doesn't want
that. He wants bread.

1cd1560e-c273-4c73-a770-d8c9fef9f144-0
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:36.970
The other man is telling him to
point at this other drawer.

fa28d671-37a7-4fe1-b256-0d06f22b0656-0
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.900
And he's opening this door and
getting this vegetable out.

767ef652-ba9a-4d4c-a96e-235bf778f308-0
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.280
And.

a30e8817-d327-4dac-a8fd-c1b1013096de-0
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.623
The first man that we have
started with in this story is

a30e8817-d327-4dac-a8fd-c1b1013096de-1
00:18:49.623 --> 00:18:51.710
biting onto this vegetable.

e3ab9665-1334-4d3f-9adc-49de99eaa33f-0
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.583
The little boy is holding a
basket and the basket is going

e3ab9665-1334-4d3f-9adc-49de99eaa33f-1
00:18:56.583 --> 00:19:00.937
to our first man and the 2nd man
is pointing him in a certain

e3ab9665-1334-4d3f-9adc-49de99eaa33f-2
00:19:00.937 --> 00:19:05.361
direction and it looks like he's
welcoming him to do something

e3ab9665-1334-4d3f-9adc-49de99eaa33f-3
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:07.959
{which I'm ready for the next
page.}

cabc8fd3-e664-4a9d-b755-2545eb753881-0
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.740
And the next page we are looking
at.

28853bee-11f8-404e-84e5-bc23318ecacf-0
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.996
I'm going to call him the
salesman. The salesman is

28853bee-11f8-404e-84e5-bc23318ecacf-1
00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:21.178
holding something. Again, these
are very imaginary looking

28853bee-11f8-404e-84e5-bc23318ecacf-2
00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:25.431
things so it's hard to know what
they are exactly. It looks

28853bee-11f8-404e-84e5-bc23318ecacf-3
00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:30.039
almost like a shrimp and the boy
is holding something that looks

28853bee-11f8-404e-84e5-bc23318ecacf-4
00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:34.647
like a tube and he they are all
looking very happy. The salesman

28853bee-11f8-404e-84e5-bc23318ecacf-5
00:19:34.647 --> 00:19:34.860
is.

ec519990-daff-4eca-8fb5-9529037831dd-0
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.415
Looking at a plant and the
little boy is looking at another

ec519990-daff-4eca-8fb5-9529037831dd-1
00:19:39.415 --> 00:19:41.640
plant that looks like a giant
artichoke.

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-0
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.928
They are holding all of these
very unusual looking vegetable

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-1
00:19:46.928 --> 00:19:51.584
items and showing them to our
first man. And the little boy is

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-2
00:19:51.584 --> 00:19:56.314
taking a bite out of what looks
like a strawberry and our first

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-3
00:19:56.314 --> 00:20:00.970
man is taking a bite out of some
sort of an unusual vegetable.

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-4
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.848
And the little boy is giving the
imaginary creature pet something

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-5
00:20:05.848 --> 00:20:10.209
to eat. And meanwhile in the
basket now we are observing a

df3258c4-d29f-4924-be12-ea270cc14397-6
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.870
number of different vegetable
like.

834467c4-6786-48b2-b077-1b5cc91fba90-0
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.110
Unusual.

58aa07f0-5af1-42ba-b643-68233ba0cbc1-0
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:15.560
Thing.

a1a8617e-aa59-4ce8-b86f-4015f4e003a3-0
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.080
The little boy is telling a
secret to the salesman. The

a1a8617e-aa59-4ce8-b86f-4015f4e003a3-1
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.896
Salesman has his arm around our
first man and they each have a

a1a8617e-aa59-4ce8-b86f-4015f4e003a3-2
00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:31.636
basket full of vegetables. Let's
see have you in front of the

a1a8617e-aa59-4ce8-b86f-4015f4e003a3-3
00:20:31.636 --> 00:20:36.452
picture. Here the little boy is
pointing off in a direction to

a1a8617e-aa59-4ce8-b86f-4015f4e003a3-4
00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:37.139
his left.

7e970137-8611-4817-8a2c-8bf247fef114-0
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:43.206
And we are looking at a scene
of, again, this city and some

7e970137-8611-4817-8a2c-8bf247fef114-1
00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:47.340
boats a number of votes and the
three of them.

a986e407-4443-454a-a7a6-f3339ea7d0ca-0
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.930
With the imaginary creature are
walking along.

9278cfe8-4510-402b-9fab-102edf494d19-0
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.800
{OK. So that was about 10
minutes and we'll keep going

9278cfe8-4510-402b-9fab-102edf494d19-1
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.220
here.}

2c5822fb-1a78-4467-9f87-a5a3556cfd04-0
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:04.645
They're walking towards a boat
and the little boy is welcoming

2c5822fb-1a78-4467-9f87-a5a3556cfd04-1
00:21:04.645 --> 00:21:06.270
him to a big urn

a7da21df-c2bc-47a2-a8ef-60fdd701549b-0
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:11.344
In the urn there is something
poking out, and as our first man

a7da21df-c2bc-47a2-a8ef-60fdd701549b-1
00:21:11.344 --> 00:21:15.320
is looking on, it looks like
it's the tail of a creature

a7da21df-c2bc-47a2-a8ef-60fdd701549b-2
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.180
coming out of the urn, and he's
looking.

728361e9-2b31-490b-b0e7-c7248d2c83a0-0
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.040
Surprised and.

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-0
00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.780
The salesman is comforting him
like he doesn't have to be

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-1
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.014
afraid of this item and oh, it's
it actually looks like it's some

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-2
00:21:31.014 --> 00:21:35.184
sort of a cat like creature with
a long tail. And the little boy

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-3
00:21:35.184 --> 00:21:38.904
is hugging onto this little
creature and so it looks like

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-4
00:21:38.904 --> 00:21:42.946
it's a very friendly creature
and no one has to be afraid. And

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-5
00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:46.410
this creature can be friends
with the other imaginary

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-6
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.745
creature so they can play
together and there's some

d71632bc-d349-4c41-a5c1-d251a23befb7-7
00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:53.210
communication going on here and
the our first man is.

bf49ac27-3d37-42c1-b619-1d5ea0f0bd1a-0
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.790
Drawing a picture. He's drawing
a picture of houses and a tail.

6637cda4-e863-4e76-9c99-4ae7fec69466-0
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.960
And he is showing that to the
salesman, the salesman.

aec3e7bf-e4b0-4784-bbc2-3be72f59c246-0
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.580
 Is looking up
into the sky. #END_arrival_4 OK.

c413ee48-50dd-4ca4-80ee-cef714d8bed1-0
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.127
Alright, so that was this part
of the story, OK, right. So then

c413ee48-50dd-4ca4-80ee-cef714d8bed1-1
00:22:11.127 --> 00:22:15.328
we can move on to the next
series or graphic novel. Again,

c413ee48-50dd-4ca4-80ee-cef714d8bed1-2
00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:19.742
take between 10 and 15 minutes.
But then since it's a shorter

c413ee48-50dd-4ca4-80ee-cef714d8bed1-3
00:22:19.742 --> 00:22:23.444
item, it will be around 3
slides. You don't have to

c413ee48-50dd-4ca4-80ee-cef714d8bed1-4
00:22:23.444 --> 00:22:27.644
intentionally track it out
either. So just go at your pace

c413ee48-50dd-4ca4-80ee-cef714d8bed1-5
00:22:27.644 --> 00:22:32.130
and describe what you see and
what is happening with details.

755862f5-338a-40ed-918a-236c2e379c51-0
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.820
#START_arrival_2 OK, we start
with.

6d9a10c1-32fc-4ecc-affb-b0cd895cc4c6-0
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.280
A scene of three people.

6eaf6b9c-b7ba-45e5-8df3-527b176a6f44-0
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.110
And it looks like they are
waiting.

3a3cf046-2112-465d-8e5c-b5dcc5ae7434-0
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.270
Yeah, it looks like there are.

807f852f-537e-4739-b00b-8520ee13e6d2-0
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.660
A number of other people also
waiting. There are three men and

807f852f-537e-4739-b00b-8520ee13e6d2-1
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.300
a woman holding a baby.

b91d44ad-b8f0-4ada-a5f1-c23f160975ec-0
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.970
There is a man looking down at a
book and writing something.

ab19663d-e0b7-40b8-8ff5-d769d39c6132-0
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.200
After he writes.

5d9275d8-6164-41d3-abee-770f799f1fe2-0
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.888
this He takes a page out of the
box  and he makes it into what

5d9275d8-6164-41d3-abee-770f799f1fe2-1
00:23:10.888 --> 00:23:12.640
looks like a crane.

e2fe5fa4-a497-4a27-9cea-e01d4cd138e1-0
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.650
Holds the crane up.

21725fc3-2666-4931-b6cf-a5d9d955c97d-0
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.630
And we see him looking off.

7a002d2c-40b4-44c7-9bbd-c9cb0ce04b3f-0
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.090


14f11281-343a-48a6-945a-f0947e6c5583-0
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.308
He's looking into the air and
there are a number of birds

14f11281-343a-48a6-945a-f0947e6c5583-1
00:23:26.308 --> 00:23:30.443
flying in the air and they are
flying over a ship with a number

14f11281-343a-48a6-945a-f0947e6c5583-2
00:23:30.443 --> 00:23:34.192
of people that are on the ship.
Quite a lot of people all

14f11281-343a-48a6-945a-f0947e6c5583-3
00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:38.069
crammed together on this ship
and it looks like all of them

14f11281-343a-48a6-945a-f0947e6c5583-4
00:23:38.069 --> 00:23:41.882
are looking into the air and
looking at all of these birds

14f11281-343a-48a6-945a-f0947e6c5583-5
00:23:41.882 --> 00:23:43.110
that are flying by.

09632a71-dd8a-4cb4-8b6e-1bb0dbe33808-0
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.310
OK.

b621035a-61ca-4938-be79-81b6296bdbfd-0
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.840
So that scene shows the people.

256d404e-c927-475c-bfea-a38c2a05cb2e-0
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:57.275
staring off of the ship and
they're looking out over a

256d404e-c927-475c-bfea-a38c2a05cb2e-1
00:23:57.275 --> 00:24:02.430
harbor that has a number of
boats on it, and there are two

256d404e-c927-475c-bfea-a38c2a05cb2e-2
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:08.197
very large it looks like they're
sculptures sitting on ships, and

256d404e-c927-475c-bfea-a38c2a05cb2e-3
00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:11.430
the sculptures are possibly two
men.

c0508936-4f91-472c-838e-2b6ca925c2a8-0
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.020
And.

62fb5a93-8d5f-4ec1-9d3f-6b65b1941719-0
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.879
The sculptures have one of the
one of the men as it looks like

62fb5a93-8d5f-4ec1-9d3f-6b65b1941719-1
00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:23.040
a suitcase, a cup and a saucer
and urn and a bowl.

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-0
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.008
The other one has oh, there's
also a creature sitting on his

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-1
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:32.001
arm which is sort of like a
rabbit with a long tail, either

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-2
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:36.192
imaginary type creatures. The
man. The the other statute has a

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-3
00:24:36.192 --> 00:24:40.451
bird on the shoulder of that man
and he also has some sort of a

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-4
00:24:40.451 --> 00:24:44.643
pot and a teapot and a little
tipi like structure on his boat.

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-5
00:24:44.643 --> 00:24:48.835
And these boats are next to each
other and there are these two

94209863-3c17-4aac-b669-c532a9cd56a1-6
00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:51.429
statue like figures are holding
hands.

8d16a9fd-d284-4798-a2d0-88f02f2571dd-0
00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.318
You think they're very tall,
tall statues and there's a city

8d16a9fd-d284-4798-a2d0-88f02f2571dd-1
00:24:56.318 --> 00:24:58.300
in the background. {OK, next.}

ec32c7f0-72ee-4a07-9205-4d5f92ba6cbe-0
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.020
The picture from.

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-0
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.152
The water of how large the boat
is and we're seeing the

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-1
00:25:09.152 --> 00:25:13.298
beautiful sky in the background
with lots of dark clouds.

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-2
00:25:13.298 --> 00:25:17.802
There's another ship next to the
it almost looks like an ocean

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-3
00:25:17.802 --> 00:25:22.233
liner that they are on and we
see some birds flying the next.

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-4
00:25:22.233 --> 00:25:26.737
The next page shows the people
on the ship, a number of people

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-5
00:25:26.737 --> 00:25:31.240
together. It looks like a some
sort of a conductor type figure

cfa7d95b-3fd0-487b-8946-ed3d3ba2795f-6
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.600
yelling something out to them
and the boat is.

3bb50754-a5e8-4813-ba4e-878a0434f62a-0
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.187
It looks like it's docking so
they're getting ready to line up

3bb50754-a5e8-4813-ba4e-878a0434f62a-1
00:25:38.187 --> 00:25:40.230
to get off of the boat, and
they're.

b01047f1-eac5-4437-a8c1-9fc60e3fb877-0
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.790
They have their
suitcases with them. #END_arrival_2 OK

9704cd6b-5ca8-42f8-85e4-d7e8adb35b97-0
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.990
So was that part of the story?

2455a212-be71-45e6-9e91-a9b578f317f1-0
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.130
Moving on, this is a complex
scene.

12b61624-fc45-4309-a5ad-bcda8abf52dd-0
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.125
And again, please take between
three and five minutes to

12b61624-fc45-4309-a5ad-bcda8abf52dd-1
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:58.700
describe what you see and what
is happening.

c3b38a5a-829d-4595-a6c6-7a07fed782f6-0
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.717
#START_waldo_1 OK, here's
another where's Waldo scene, and

c3b38a5a-829d-4595-a6c6-7a07fed782f6-1
00:26:07.717 --> 00:26:11.944
it's a very busy place as it
always is with where's Waldo.

c3b38a5a-829d-4595-a6c6-7a07fed782f6-2
00:26:11.944 --> 00:26:16.457
This looks like a little town
with a number of buildings and a

c3b38a5a-829d-4595-a6c6-7a07fed782f6-3
00:26:16.457 --> 00:26:20.971
number of people all over the
streets doing various things. We

c3b38a5a-829d-4595-a6c6-7a07fed782f6-4
00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:25.413
will start with a set of people
that are lined up to purchase

c3b38a5a-829d-4595-a6c6-7a07fed782f6-5
00:26:25.413 --> 00:26:26.130
something.

7900bcfd-35b9-4a7e-bcd7-b9f64801276d-0
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.210
And, uh, looks like somebody is
selling plants.

f259d1f7-7d7f-4a1a-897b-c82eb4a2cb5c-0
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.495
Uh, let's see. We have people
that are on motorcycles. We have

f259d1f7-7d7f-4a1a-897b-c82eb4a2cb5c-1
00:26:35.495 --> 00:26:36.860
cars. We have trucks.

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-0
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.900
We have people on bicycles. We
have people coming out of

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-1
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.960
manholes. We have a fountain and
someone in a scuba outfit who is

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-2
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.330
flying on top of the fountain
water. We have a number of

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-3
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.160
people watching him outside of
the fountain. We have people on

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-4
00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.836
the roof. We have two people
that look like they're fighting

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-5
00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:05.513
with mops with buckets on their
heads and someone is feeding

2dcac29e-d890-4e96-8b74-6aaa310111a4-6
00:27:05.513 --> 00:27:07.660
pigeons on on that same roof

44a65afd-3756-4db2-b10e-dec791a9f0ae-0
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.770
We have somebody on a ladder and
we have.

eb2d43ef-5121-409a-8028-34a9cadfd21f-0
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:19.119
This looks like a fireman on top
of a roof and they have hoses

eb2d43ef-5121-409a-8028-34a9cadfd21f-1
00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.930
that they are putting out of
fire.

81117480-d854-4b8b-abaf-e015a7845473-0
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.770
We have a

066813db-15db-4172-bd72-68f5fbf662d7-0
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:25.730
car

e418ac80-2c74-4800-a721-f0cc5907061c-0
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.548
polluting the air with some
smoke coming out of the back of

e418ac80-2c74-4800-a721-f0cc5907061c-1
00:27:31.548 --> 00:27:35.577
the car and we have a crossing
guard helping children to come

e418ac80-2c74-4800-a721-f0cc5907061c-2
00:27:35.577 --> 00:27:39.671
across the street. It looks like
somebody has fallen off their

e418ac80-2c74-4800-a721-f0cc5907061c-3
00:27:39.671 --> 00:27:43.050
bike and it's the doctor's
coming to help them and.

89d205ab-ad6d-4fa4-9a01-1c4c1922a3ac-0
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.791
Let's see. Got some people
staring into a window. It looks

89d205ab-ad6d-4fa4-9a01-1c4c1922a3ac-1
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:50.973
like they're staring at a
television. We have a shoe

89d205ab-ad6d-4fa4-9a01-1c4c1922a3ac-2
00:27:50.973 --> 00:27:54.515
store, people shopping in the
shoe store. We have somebody

89d205ab-ad6d-4fa4-9a01-1c4c1922a3ac-3
00:27:54.515 --> 00:27:58.237
that is working on a vehicle
that looks like there's a lot of

89d205ab-ad6d-4fa4-9a01-1c4c1922a3ac-4
00:27:58.237 --> 00:28:02.019
parts of that vehicle that are
outside that is putting, taking

89d205ab-ad6d-4fa4-9a01-1c4c1922a3ac-5
00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:03.460
out and putting back in.

f80278ec-ed7b-47ca-9aaf-c3f4c92b056c-0
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.480


e448c8ed-868b-4525-8c20-7e195ee06eae-0
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.190
we have people at a little cafe

d1945cf0-a542-4f10-b07a-6876a5bee792-0
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.560
And a waiter is pouring
something into.

0994723e-8209-49d4-ac92-b54ebefe0990-0
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.240
A cup.

300bd96e-2e34-45e1-91cb-3e2b2069bdd8-0
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.240
And I think that's about it for
me. #END_waldo_1 

fe292f3d-49b0-4fae-a033-3e8a591330ec-0
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.250
OK, it's like around 2 1/2
minutes.

ffe285a0-a4d6-4b7e-b0e7-637b755dfaa7-0
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:30.919
OK, moving on to the next one.
So we've got a really long one.

ffe285a0-a4d6-4b7e-b0e7-637b755dfaa7-1
00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:35.857
This is the longest of all the
items you'll see around 40

ffe285a0-a4d6-4b7e-b0e7-637b755dfaa7-2
00:28:35.857 --> 00:28:37.390
something slides.

ba463f97-30a6-4a75-bf86-735cd4f93f13-0
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.640
So just describe what you see.

4e39ff77-db92-4f73-a430-17c5ba80bcea-0
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.534
And even though the the target
time is 10 to 15 minutes, it's

4e39ff77-db92-4f73-a430-17c5ba80bcea-1
00:28:47.534 --> 00:28:51.282
OK to go a little over since
it's the longest one, OK,

4e39ff77-db92-4f73-a430-17c5ba80bcea-2
00:28:51.282 --> 00:28:51.760
right?

83a1541c-0697-44e7-8960-a78b904b873f-0
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:03.985
#START_wanderer OK, I'm seeing 2
individuals and it looks like

83a1541c-0697-44e7-8960-a78b904b873f-1
00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:09.507
they have a giant piece of paper
and they are holding the paper

83a1541c-0697-44e7-8960-a78b904b873f-2
00:29:09.507 --> 00:29:09.680
up

7d4265b1-c100-4218-8369-be0b188bfe64-0
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.340
and the paper is being folded
into what looks like a giant hat

86fe7d85-f114-4eb1-a367-32f5c5432b7f-0
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.400
And the two people, one looks
like he's some sort of evil

86fe7d85-f114-4eb1-a367-32f5c5432b7f-1
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.460
creature with a horn on his
head, and the other one looks

86fe7d85-f114-4eb1-a367-32f5c5432b7f-2
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.230
like a boy.

4476abf4-21d7-4441-bbe5-98d452f3082b-0
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.900
In the next picture we have a
ship.

30dcb05d-a0ac-4bd4-a20b-dbbbdbcb40e2-0
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.450
A very unusual looking ship.

277a3b80-4c0a-47f8-b1ca-4d63fa812e41-0
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:40.912
That looks like it is going on
the ocean towards this hat that

277a3b80-4c0a-47f8-b1ca-4d63fa812e41-1
00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:41.770
is also.

4b251445-8277-40e6-87df-390371c5b99f-0
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.430
Floating along on the ocean.

f436971c-ecd2-4fb4-a3ba-b7d40ed8304a-0
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.950
The next picture shows a lot of
seagulls flying over the ocean

f436971c-ecd2-4fb4-a3ba-b7d40ed8304a-1
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.110
and they are the little, I guess
it's not really a hat, it's a

f436971c-ecd2-4fb4-a3ba-b7d40ed8304a-2
00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:01.403
ship that they have folded into.
I mean it looks like a hat that

f436971c-ecd2-4fb4-a3ba-b7d40ed8304a-3
00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:05.299
it's actually a ship that they
have put on to the ocean to

f436971c-ecd2-4fb4-a3ba-b7d40ed8304a-4
00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:08.799
float along and so the seagulls
are flying above it.

a046611d-f500-41e9-bd5c-c4e79bdfa1ad-0
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.480
And in the next one as the.

ef242889-db80-43df-b18b-53b5fb6176ac-0
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.380
as the ship. As the little paper
ship is floating along, we see

ef242889-db80-43df-b18b-53b5fb6176ac-1
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.507
some turtles checking it out. We
see a seagull perched on the

ef242889-db80-43df-b18b-53b5fb6176ac-2
00:30:23.507 --> 00:30:24.240
side of it.

d2cfc2e4-f488-4306-a7d1-9ff470974214-0
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.739
And then we see what it looks
like, possibly a whale coming

d2cfc2e4-f488-4306-a7d1-9ff470974214-1
00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:29.440
towards it.

9fa9a559-5cc0-4c6f-b523-034a22be133d-0
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.387
And the whale is now holding
this little ship up with its I

9fa9a559-5cc0-4c6f-b523-034a22be133d-1
00:30:39.387 --> 00:30:44.132
don't know if it's a fin or a
fluke, but anyways it is going

9fa9a559-5cc0-4c6f-b523-034a22be133d-2
00:30:44.132 --> 00:30:49.188
well itself is swimming towards
what looks like a coral reef and

9fa9a559-5cc0-4c6f-b523-034a22be133d-3
00:30:49.188 --> 00:30:53.777
there are a number of little
fish swimming around and what

9fa9a559-5cc0-4c6f-b523-034a22be133d-4
00:30:53.777 --> 00:30:57.978
looks like a swordfish also
swimming along numbers of

9fa9a559-5cc0-4c6f-b523-034a22be133d-5
00:30:57.978 --> 00:31:01.089
schools of different types of
fish and.

38da7bb3-f84f-4903-a4f2-ea87b99f4e0c-0
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.630
Different types of coral that
we're going towards.

821ea51a-f111-471e-895c-2ac6bd35336e-0
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.532
The little ship is now above the
coral and sort of floating along

821ea51a-f111-471e-895c-2ac6bd35336e-1
00:31:15.532 --> 00:31:19.925
on a large school of fish. And
again, there are a number of

821ea51a-f111-471e-895c-2ac6bd35336e-2
00:31:19.925 --> 00:31:24.464
different types of schools of
fish, different types of coral,

821ea51a-f111-471e-895c-2ac6bd35336e-3
00:31:24.464 --> 00:31:27.100
and it's just a beautiful scene
of.

e7973009-9863-4198-98e0-d04ae08b69f0-0
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.860
What what it looks like around a
coral reef with a number of

e7973009-9863-4198-98e0-d04ae08b69f0-1
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.760
fish, different types of fish,
different schools of fish.

6ba427c2-efa9-43c9-aba7-f37060ac714c-0
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:39.600
And we have some kissing fish
down below, and we have.

5280b038-3299-4280-ae40-14bb03f21247-0
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.880
Hmm.

e0f17cad-da54-49ef-8845-d8a499e059bb-0
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.896
Again, we're still on, we're
still going along. The coral

e0f17cad-da54-49ef-8845-d8a499e059bb-1
00:31:47.896 --> 00:31:52.306
reefers, all sorts of creatures.
There are some unusual looking

e0f17cad-da54-49ef-8845-d8a499e059bb-2
00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:56.509
creature that has a pair of
scissors and there's a lionfish.

09a95c36-5be9-41c8-b366-db9475e7d11d-0
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.220
And it looks like someone on the
ship, a little boat you should

09a95c36-5be9-41c8-b366-db9475e7d11d-1
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.926
say, is fishing and trying to
catch a fish. I see a fishing

09a95c36-5be9-41c8-b366-db9475e7d11d-2
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:10.750
pole coming off of the little
boat.

2e9f8f46-7072-49d6-a33e-a759c9a39d0d-0
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.177
As we move along, there is a
seahorse standing on a fish

2e9f8f46-7072-49d6-a33e-a759c9a39d0d-1
00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:24.122
checking out a little boat. And
we do see some amazing creatures

2e9f8f46-7072-49d6-a33e-a759c9a39d0d-2
00:32:24.122 --> 00:32:29.068
in the coral, different types of
fish. And let's see, I'm seeing

2e9f8f46-7072-49d6-a33e-a759c9a39d0d-3
00:32:29.068 --> 00:32:33.710
these fish. Let's see. It looks
like there's an eel. That's.

47a384f7-6984-4545-911d-f4e46bf6840a-0
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.592
Going up to check out the little
boat and now there is a sea

47a384f7-6984-4545-911d-f4e46bf6840a-1
00:32:38.592 --> 00:32:41.400
horse on the boat going along on
the boat.

152690a5-df98-459e-ba82-a1ae1b9d4c98-0
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.490
floating along with the boat as
a passenger.

3b74fac5-4f9a-4824-b1f7-1fb93a825c70-0
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.890
Now we are going along and it
looks like we have.

e859f2ce-c209-4e5f-85ed-62bf9dc1e8d2-0
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.148
Let's see. The little seahorse
is still on the little boat as

e859f2ce-c209-4e5f-85ed-62bf9dc1e8d2-1
00:32:57.148 --> 00:32:58.410
it floats along.

9f4cba4e-e143-4e31-be6e-04343c65c07a-0
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.227
That looks like a forest full of
that looks like sort of a

9f4cba4e-e143-4e31-be6e-04343c65c07a-1
00:33:04.227 --> 00:33:09.279
Flamingo type bird. Many, many
of them in this little forest

9f4cba4e-e143-4e31-be6e-04343c65c07a-2
00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:14.332
and some flowers. As the little
boat is floating along it is

9f4cba4e-e143-4e31-be6e-04343c65c07a-3
00:33:14.332 --> 00:33:19.550
going past this beautiful forest
of unusual plants, trees with

9f4cba4e-e143-4e31-be6e-04343c65c07a-4
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.870
these flamingos all over it.

dcd8147d-85f4-4ce8-a665-e84e33fbd03a-0
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.145
As we get closer, we can see the
individual leaves on these

dcd8147d-85f4-4ce8-a665-e84e33fbd03a-1
00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:35.562
plants that are very unusual. It
looks like the roots go down

dcd8147d-85f4-4ce8-a665-e84e33fbd03a-2
00:33:35.562 --> 00:33:38.840
into the ocean. We see some tall
flower like.

e1f23deb-4501-4a41-9ffd-ec67e3fdc1a7-0
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.770
Plants and the fish take all
different types of fish.

90698a47-5eac-4562-a601-c067928b276e-0
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.620
That are floating along
underneath the boat.

4d7c82fb-6975-41b3-a2f7-b8d341877d94-0
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.730
As the boat goes further into
this magnificent forest.

b42a3011-b45d-4dd6-a4ad-a709f1d29bc9-0
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.080
It looks like there is a path
within that forest that the

b42a3011-b45d-4dd6-a4ad-a709f1d29bc9-1
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.843
water can flow through. We see
some Beautiful Creatures with

b42a3011-b45d-4dd6-a4ad-a709f1d29bc9-2
00:34:09.843 --> 00:34:15.418
lighted eyes, and we see some
birds with glowing eyes also

b42a3011-b45d-4dd6-a4ad-a709f1d29bc9-3
00:34:15.418 --> 00:34:21.276
that are somehow in this forest.
They almost look like dragon

b42a3011-b45d-4dd6-a4ad-a709f1d29bc9-4
00:34:21.276 --> 00:34:26.756
heads, but it's not clear
exactly what they are, but they

b42a3011-b45d-4dd6-a4ad-a709f1d29bc9-5
00:34:26.756 --> 00:34:27.890
are looking.

a5282dc9-eeea-4c7b-8de8-8313a5f611d5-0
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.925
Into the little boat that still
has the little seahorse floating

a5282dc9-eeea-4c7b-8de8-8313a5f611d5-1
00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:35.310
along with it, and the seahorse
has a little hat that looks very

a5282dc9-eeea-4c7b-8de8-8313a5f611d5-2
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.300
much like the boat.

1d27a324-912e-48d8-8591-2d68fe626405-0
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.485
And the little boat continues to
flow along through this

1d27a324-912e-48d8-8591-2d68fe626405-1
00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:50.049
imaginary world. We're seeing
some other unusual creatures.

1d27a324-912e-48d8-8591-2d68fe626405-2
00:34:50.049 --> 00:34:54.840
There's something actually on.
It looks like it's on a lobster

1d27a324-912e-48d8-8591-2d68fe626405-3
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.210
something that is.

4669bc91-4df9-4fa6-9a7e-01c4bd8530be-0
00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:03.983
Using a lobster to travel on and
there are a number of other

4669bc91-4df9-4fa6-9a7e-01c4bd8530be-1
00:35:03.983 --> 00:35:05.810
little fish and.

6ab9db97-7dad-4305-aceb-c7f28af807fe-0
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.410
eeel like creatures

a6cb8d1f-fca8-4274-8fb7-2a3845712755-0
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.040
In underneath the.

5471984e-9316-457f-b7f9-589bebbdf667-0
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.710
beneath the sea as we go by and
it looks like the seahorse is

5471984e-9316-457f-b7f9-589bebbdf667-1
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.656
looking down onto this creature
that is using the lobster to

5471984e-9316-457f-b7f9-589bebbdf667-2
00:35:20.656 --> 00:35:22.920
transport himself and the
lobster.

64fd5b97-97eb-4c4c-b44c-92510fe9f5c5-0
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:29.490
Has its antennae poking up water
towards the seahorse.

128ca721-ba8d-4567-9fad-dab559e853b0-0
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.450
and I see some other seahorses
too, and it looks like.

f557d76a-f25e-4209-9716-387a80616a68-0
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.320
The seahorse is going to jump
down off of the little boat to

f557d76a-f25e-4209-9716-387a80616a68-1
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.930
be with his fellow sea horse
creatures.

740889a9-abf3-4e68-8eb8-044fb9ab504f-0
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.935
Now we see the little boat
flying along and it looks like a

740889a9-abf3-4e68-8eb8-044fb9ab504f-1
00:35:48.935 --> 00:35:53.030
whale like creature. A very
large whale like creature with.

426ca2a9-c0a6-4f49-a2f3-c5c94fa5f906-0
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.880
Smoking a pipe and has little
birds.

6eebef15-2d1a-441e-90e2-a02f56bb68b0-0
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:06.093
A light on a light on the top of
the head of the whale as the

6eebef15-2d1a-441e-90e2-a02f56bb68b0-1
00:36:06.093 --> 00:36:12.591
little boat flies by and we see
another very unusual looking

6eebef15-2d1a-441e-90e2-a02f56bb68b0-2
00:36:12.591 --> 00:36:18.130
creature. And this creature has
has some sort of a.

0f621199-8849-4122-b780-196f37454763-0
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.730
Antennae can I that has what
looks like a machine that can

d38c0f5f-37eb-48a1-b8ca-1bbd29d99135-0
00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.382
View the boat. It's not clear to
me what is going on, but this

d38c0f5f-37eb-48a1-b8ca-1bbd29d99135-1
00:36:28.382 --> 00:36:31.801
creature is very unusual looking
and he's standing what looks on

d38c0f5f-37eb-48a1-b8ca-1bbd29d99135-2
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:34.219
what looks like a pile of trash
in the ocean.

7a608ab9-0694-4b94-a912-47ec0b51467c-0
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.870
As we move along.

1553bd02-9039-41fd-b605-411e21439c9d-0
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.640
We get into more and more
mysterious looking creatures.

0a278674-4ae9-4b94-8140-37b14976aff4-0
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.573
These creatures look similar to
creatures that we may know of,

0a278674-4ae9-4b94-8140-37b14976aff4-1
00:36:51.573 --> 00:36:56.500
like butterflies and cats and
zebras and leopards, but they

0a278674-4ae9-4b94-8140-37b14976aff4-2
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.755
are not the ones that we would
normally see elephants with very

0a278674-4ae9-4b94-8140-37b14976aff4-3
00:37:01.755 --> 00:37:04.630
strange ears that are ruffled
and.

f081fcaa-fd6b-4c3f-b253-4c5a6b50aedd-0
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.516
Horses with spots all over them,
and the little boat is going

f081fcaa-fd6b-4c3f-b253-4c5a6b50aedd-1
00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:14.494
along amongst all these
creatures as it continues its

f081fcaa-fd6b-4c3f-b253-4c5a6b50aedd-2
00:37:14.494 --> 00:37:18.840
path on the ocean. We see so
many different things. We see

f081fcaa-fd6b-4c3f-b253-4c5a6b50aedd-3
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.260
what like looks like a moon in
the sky and a bat flying by.

7a36b858-170d-4427-bcdf-eb33a58eb423-0
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.443
There's creatures that look like
butterflies in the sky, but

7a36b858-170d-4427-bcdf-eb33a58eb423-1
00:37:28.443 --> 00:37:31.110
they're not like anything that
we normally would.

7cedf167-0784-4238-aa8c-5e0930a8599d-0
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:37.100
Know about the boat continues
onward as the little pet.

c18590f4-2b88-45c9-bc5b-8e55f897870b-0
00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.080
flies onto the boat.

0af4348b-27d0-4643-b2e1-940904eacd3e-0
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.930
Now it's getting dark.

9198b4ae-7ef1-4968-9728-bcb7685dcb77-0
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.840
Going along in the night sky, we
see many, many.

51be591c-3dd6-4b16-bdf3-2dd386391f0a-0
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.400
Stars in the sky and planets and
we see the moon, a Crescent moon

51be591c-3dd6-4b16-bdf3-2dd386391f0a-1
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.533
in underneath the sea. We see a
lot of eyes, a lot of glowing

51be591c-3dd6-4b16-bdf3-2dd386391f0a-2
00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:01.400
eyes of different creatures.

4290738b-f5b9-409a-b7fd-c0c14a0ecb4e-0
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:10.367
And as we continue through this
night ocean scene, we see a lot

4290738b-f5b9-409a-b7fd-c0c14a0ecb4e-1
00:38:10.367 --> 00:38:14.997
of fish poking up through the
ocean with their glowing eyes.

4290738b-f5b9-409a-b7fd-c0c14a0ecb4e-2
00:38:14.997 --> 00:38:19.550
Many, many, many fish. And
they're all poking up looking at

4290738b-f5b9-409a-b7fd-c0c14a0ecb4e-3
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.600
the boat, the little boats.

8cc63349-761f-4787-a6d0-8dcd360fb5a9-0
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.530
And the boat continues on and
looks like in the sky there is.

bc929dec-15df-4997-a2f8-d4137bc109c1-0
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.238
Something like the Aurora
borealis floating all through

bc929dec-15df-4997-a2f8-d4137bc109c1-1
00:38:32.238 --> 00:38:36.761
the sky and again it's a night
scene. We have some fish jumping

bc929dec-15df-4997-a2f8-d4137bc109c1-2
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:39.730
up through the water and going
back down.

cd527774-8cfa-4be4-ac5c-80348b7d9cc5-0
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.600
And it looks very peaceful.

ec2a798b-3c28-46b5-b945-b3600269736d-0
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.410
And now it looks like it's going
by an iceberg in the water.

e5f940fe-8400-446d-abbc-ed411be25be9-0
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.640
A very tall iceberg.

3d635044-f69a-4f53-ae3b-de036abc8a05-0
00:38:54.810 --> 00:39:00.234
And it continues on through what
looks like a number of caves and

3d635044-f69a-4f53-ae3b-de036abc8a05-1
00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:03.440
mountains, possibly with snow on
them.

1545ccea-2faf-42a1-80f0-abe82d6e13ff-0
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:08.208
Multiple caves that have
archways that the boat can

1545ccea-2faf-42a1-80f0-abe82d6e13ff-1
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:10.580
continue to go sailing through.

216bd095-d4be-4052-b3e1-b4d2d50a1bab-0
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.360
As it continues on through these
glacier like and.

5b48fde8-74ed-4ab6-a441-e5351d23000c-0
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.270
A cave like structures.

9752cd65-3d18-4133-a40d-eb895490ef50-0
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.380
Something pops up.

66130ccb-91db-4b5c-9399-26910a7d733f-0
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.635
Through the ocean and it looks
like it has a light attached and

66130ccb-91db-4b5c-9399-26910a7d733f-1
00:39:29.635 --> 00:39:33.580
as we move forward it looks like
there is a creature.

1d4beb6f-061d-4821-a9e8-94e2a5f5fafe-0
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.370
Is that a human creature? It's
hard to know.

de601a4c-c038-4815-b3a2-8bf256be8e15-0
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.140
But it has eyes.

279407ed-52cc-4027-bd0c-e46c0c6f35b8-0
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:46.320
It's oh gosh, it's hard to even
describe this thing. It is.

641d94da-aaf8-4613-8739-28f8b843c479-0
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.130
Something.

0ee3a0d2-d38a-44ef-9e68-1e7feb28d906-0
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.950
That is like part mechanical.

ea6158de-7f67-410d-b1f8-6b7b6f46009d-0
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:57.292
Part human, part fish, and it's
picking up the boat and shining

ea6158de-7f67-410d-b1f8-6b7b6f46009d-1
00:39:57.292 --> 00:40:02.271
a light on the boat. It looks
like it is looking at the boat

ea6158de-7f67-410d-b1f8-6b7b6f46009d-2
00:40:02.271 --> 00:40:03.740
to see what it is.

68c47175-b325-42e4-a31c-981a8f961286-0
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.000
So it's the boat is being picked
up out of the ocean.

16b0796f-66e3-4c78-9bd0-6b8b55318060-0
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:14.557
Now, in this picture the boat is
that's sailing along the ocean

16b0796f-66e3-4c78-9bd0-6b8b55318060-1
00:40:14.557 --> 00:40:18.220
and it's going towards what
looks like a very tall.

8f5408e1-6631-4c32-80f5-85e7188f5a3e-0
00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.160
Ocean liner.

04e39011-88d7-4bdf-8516-e7420284cb09-0
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.020
Vessel there are some seagulls
flying by.

9377e9c1-1a76-49f5-a156-78dc347918f1-0
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.023
There is a that looks like a lot
of smoke coming out of the

9377e9c1-1a76-49f5-a156-78dc347918f1-1
00:40:33.023 --> 00:40:33.980
smokestacks.

81283afc-02a3-4bff-b27e-1496127f4916-0
00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.050
Of this ocean liner, there's an
anchor hanging. There's an

81283afc-02a3-4bff-b27e-1496127f4916-1
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:43.447
anchor hanging out of one of the
little ports on the on the boat,

81283afc-02a3-4bff-b27e-1496127f4916-2
00:40:43.447 --> 00:40:47.710
on the ocean liner, and again,
the creature that we just saw in

81283afc-02a3-4bff-b27e-1496127f4916-3
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.310
the last.

d388dce1-d1dd-4745-afac-e02314082552-0
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.567
Uh, page still has this little
light coming out of the ocean,

d388dce1-d1dd-4745-afac-e02314082552-1
00:40:53.567 --> 00:40:57.785
and he looks like he's checking
out the ocean liner with that

d388dce1-d1dd-4745-afac-e02314082552-2
00:40:57.785 --> 00:40:58.670
little light.

d9bb7010-6874-43fa-a6ef-26c6fe002fba-0
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:00.360
OK.

f1bafab2-5246-4b3c-9cac-3e29d1ae885d-0
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:03.870
Now.

928c2a14-5561-4be3-b182-8cc08353d2f5-0
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.721
We are still sailing along and
there are a number of white

928c2a14-5561-4be3-b182-8cc08353d2f5-1
00:41:08.721 --> 00:41:12.973
birds flying through the air.
Many many white birds. And we

928c2a14-5561-4be3-b182-8cc08353d2f5-2
00:41:12.973 --> 00:41:17.438
are still seeing that what looks
like an ocean liner now looks

928c2a14-5561-4be3-b182-8cc08353d2f5-3
00:41:17.438 --> 00:41:21.620
like it is almost on a pedestal.
3 pedestals in the water.

abf9b9b8-e316-4786-b7f2-5f498fc90275-0
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.165
It looks almost like a castle in
the water and it has a crane and

abf9b9b8-e316-4786-b7f2-5f498fc90275-1
00:41:27.165 --> 00:41:31.379
it looks like there's a whale
hanging off the crane and it has

abf9b9b8-e316-4786-b7f2-5f498fc90275-2
00:41:31.379 --> 00:41:35.728
has a lot of smokestacks and it
looks like they're blowing a lot

abf9b9b8-e316-4786-b7f2-5f498fc90275-3
00:41:35.728 --> 00:41:37.200
of smoke into the air.

494c03fe-c1da-408a-905e-6fb5dad4b84d-0
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.916
Now we see from this ocean
liner, there are a number of

494c03fe-c1da-408a-905e-6fb5dad4b84d-1
00:41:45.916 --> 00:41:49.943
creatures that are shooting.
They are shooting onto our

494c03fe-c1da-408a-905e-6fb5dad4b84d-2
00:41:49.943 --> 00:41:54.545
little boat. They are shooting
onto that other creature that we

494c03fe-c1da-408a-905e-6fb5dad4b84d-3
00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:59.003
spoke about earlier who looks
like a man in a scuba suit. And

494c03fe-c1da-408a-905e-6fb5dad4b84d-4
00:41:59.003 --> 00:42:03.749
there he is on what looks like a
rocket. And the rocket is coming

494c03fe-c1da-408a-905e-6fb5dad4b84d-5
00:42:03.749 --> 00:42:04.540
out of the.

a1b6fdad-db57-4df5-ac35-61fcacf93ba8-0
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:09.752
Ocean and it looks like it's
going up towards the air and

a1b6fdad-db57-4df5-ac35-61fcacf93ba8-1
00:42:09.752 --> 00:42:10.840
there is a life.

5f5b50fb-91da-478f-bfd8-ce94d33e194c-0
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:16.367
Ring being thrown onto the
little boat and the boathouse.

5f5b50fb-91da-478f-bfd8-ce94d33e194c-1
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:20.410
It looks like a hole in it from
the being shot up.

177b24a1-4bf9-4b60-8914-0647a4588146-0
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.950
As we go further.

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-0
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:28.209
Looks like the man in the scuba
suit is has a rope tied to the

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-1
00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:32.697
boat and is flying along sailing
along behind the boat and we're

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-2
00:42:32.697 --> 00:42:36.563
going towards a number of
creatures that we are seeing.

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-3
00:42:36.563 --> 00:42:40.775
Let's see, it's the original
evil looking man. I don't think

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-4
00:42:40.775 --> 00:42:45.263
he's evil but he has a horn and
he has got a black tape and he's

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-5
00:42:45.263 --> 00:42:49.475
all dressed in black and he is
on some sort of a vessel that

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-6
00:42:49.475 --> 00:42:53.617
has a number of amazing looking
creatures, horses that have

b51546cb-6ff0-4693-b9fb-b04e5bea74fc-7
00:42:53.617 --> 00:42:54.170
glowing.

4958482d-c532-4151-947f-3c4f90c21172-0
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:59.017
Eyes and spots and it looks like
a reindeer with star shapes,

4958482d-c532-4151-947f-3c4f90c21172-1
00:42:59.017 --> 00:43:03.785
dark dark skin with star light,
star shapes and glowing eyes.

4958482d-c532-4151-947f-3c4f90c21172-2
00:43:03.785 --> 00:43:08.245
And a creature that looks almost
like a Joker and another

4958482d-c532-4151-947f-3c4f90c21172-3
00:43:08.245 --> 00:43:09.630
creature that has.

5622813f-9108-4d5a-a064-73a4ffaf8f59-0
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:14.609
Checks, checks, design, check.
Design all over him. So many

5622813f-9108-4d5a-a064-73a4ffaf8f59-1
00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:18.344
different unusual creatures. A
little cat that is the only

5622813f-9108-4d5a-a064-73a4ffaf8f59-2
00:43:18.344 --> 00:43:22.460
thing that looks somewhat normal
to me. And also there is a kite

5622813f-9108-4d5a-a064-73a4ffaf8f59-3
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.120
there. There is a kite that's
flying off.

3d2b64ed-eda9-4ff5-92e7-55e693fc9a33-0
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:26.760
On the side.

22e6b1e9-5a20-493c-beb1-fb5b7d8047e0-0
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.070
{OK, then that one.}

3382205a-a328-400b-a83a-37775e5359bb-0
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:35.626
We're now seeing a giant wave
that looks like a tidal wave and

3382205a-a328-400b-a83a-37775e5359bb-1
00:43:35.626 --> 00:43:37.450
the boat is flying along.

f50c0eee-8ac3-428a-bb55-cac1288a97e5-0
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:44.520
Inside of this tidal wave and we
see, I'm going to call them the

f50c0eee-8ac3-428a-bb55-cac1288a97e5-1
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:50.253
evil one with a giant paper
airplane. We see two what looks

f50c0eee-8ac3-428a-bb55-cac1288a97e5-2
00:43:50.253 --> 00:43:51.399
like little.

f8859d8e-5717-438d-804c-69d315ede431-0
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:58.165
Little people hanging on to what
looks like a kite. You see a

f8859d8e-5717-438d-804c-69d315ede431-1
00:43:58.165 --> 00:43:58.530
cat.

70ac1d85-ee43-4277-8d4c-15058539a0a0-0
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.780
On a tightrope walking towards
the little people on the kite.

9ad34aef-dcfd-4aa6-9064-42d2979bd042-0
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.470
And we see these creatures that
I described earlier and.

7e5e1ae7-29cb-4a96-9f3d-9a18aaff5d80-0
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.101
It seems like the the boat that
they're on sort of looks like a

7e5e1ae7-29cb-4a96-9f3d-9a18aaff5d80-1
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:16.638
Nautilus shell that they're
flying along on and we still see

7e5e1ae7-29cb-4a96-9f3d-9a18aaff5d80-2
00:44:16.638 --> 00:44:19.190
the little the scuba man in the
background.

973e1a59-d67f-4733-8684-3cd9a4734abb-0
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.970
{And that's what I see on this
page.}

d3395ebf-10fd-4694-963a-396afa2b30aa-0
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:30.308
It looks like it's a storm. We
see lightning in the sky, the

d3395ebf-10fd-4694-963a-396afa2b30aa-1
00:44:30.308 --> 00:44:34.748
boat is flying along, and we see
the paper, what looks like a

d3395ebf-10fd-4694-963a-396afa2b30aa-2
00:44:34.748 --> 00:44:38.830
paper airplane, flying through
the sky in the night sky.

a377d2b7-adfa-42c1-8fd6-cc5172ec4c32-0
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.624
the little boat, as it goes a
sailing long and the ocean is

a377d2b7-adfa-42c1-8fd6-cc5172ec4c32-1
00:44:47.624 --> 00:44:51.771
coming to what looks like a
number of little. Well, they

a377d2b7-adfa-42c1-8fd6-cc5172ec4c32-2
00:44:51.771 --> 00:44:56.282
look like Donuts. They're not
doughnuts, but somehow they are

a377d2b7-adfa-42c1-8fd6-cc5172ec4c32-3
00:44:56.282 --> 00:45:00.865
little arches that the boat is
sailing through. And the arches

a377d2b7-adfa-42c1-8fd6-cc5172ec4c32-4
00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:01.519
could be.

71e6c971-c1c9-41bf-a601-d50d62120ad1-0
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:08.358
A long long type of eel. Many,
many, many, many bumps of an eel

71e6c971-c1c9-41bf-a601-d50d62120ad1-1
00:45:08.358 --> 00:45:12.660
that is just entwined in this
ocean setting.

b3a0015e-4e06-4c79-8a02-412b8e4b6084-0
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.040
It looks like we're seeing the
head of the eel.

af61698d-f714-4308-850b-9e207abb20d8-0
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.756
And it looks like it's there's
more than one of these

af61698d-f714-4308-850b-9e207abb20d8-1
00:45:26.756 --> 00:45:31.478
creatures, and they are looking
at the little boat as it sails

af61698d-f714-4308-850b-9e207abb20d8-2
00:45:31.478 --> 00:45:35.600
towards them. One of them has a
tall horn on its head.

1b00bdd3-bd01-4493-bdb1-3d4abd69108c-0
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:46.780
The boat is sailing along and
the creatures.

6f381fb7-0bf2-4735-9280-c108ba4959f9-0
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.476
Well, there are again, very
unusual looking creatures. They

6f381fb7-0bf2-4735-9280-c108ba4959f9-1
00:45:52.476 --> 00:45:57.060
sort of like they're like like
half whale, half fish, half man,

6f381fb7-0bf2-4735-9280-c108ba4959f9-2
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.643
one of them, and the one seems
to have water that it's spouting

6f381fb7-0bf2-4735-9280-c108ba4959f9-3
00:46:01.643 --> 00:46:01.929
off.

b8001555-9cb2-4a83-b7ce-cba28f1037a0-0
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.120
Onto the little boat and the
water is pouring off of the

b8001555-9cb2-4a83-b7ce-cba28f1037a0-1
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.648
little boat, and in the next
picture this man, who seems to

b8001555-9cb2-4a83-b7ce-cba28f1037a0-2
00:46:11.648 --> 00:46:16.175
be half fish, half man, is
watching the little boat sail by

b8001555-9cb2-4a83-b7ce-cba28f1037a0-3
00:46:16.175 --> 00:46:16.930
and he is.

c04e79d9-d67f-4fd4-86e7-b9f26bb387c8-0
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.540
On an island that seems to have
some trash on it some.

b0e5c5cb-4c44-493b-b493-973e2da7a2c9-0
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.490
Bottles and cans.

58e34765-0e0f-435f-999b-29a349848689-0
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.780
Some propellers, some paper.

660a7cf6-f44b-47c2-98d5-80af4f75733e-0
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.434
And it's just watching a little
boat go by and now we're seeing

660a7cf6-f44b-47c2-98d5-80af4f75733e-1
00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:35.897
all sorts of undersea creatures
like jellyfish. They look like a

660a7cf6-f44b-47c2-98d5-80af4f75733e-2
00:46:35.897 --> 00:46:40.360
lot of jellyfish. They're little
boat is sailing along with lots

660a7cf6-f44b-47c2-98d5-80af4f75733e-3
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.000
and lots of types of jellyfish
underneath the water.

0c2ddd98-c44a-431f-8489-f4033833f42c-0
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.036
And there are enormous amount of
other creatures under there.

0c2ddd98-c44a-431f-8489-f4033833f42c-1
00:46:53.036 --> 00:46:57.646
There is a school of fish, other
types of creatures of all sorts

0c2ddd98-c44a-431f-8489-f4033833f42c-2
00:46:57.646 --> 00:47:01.050
that we find in the ocean as the
boat sails on.

5ae9e9a3-0110-486b-a49d-9d1fa3f9efad-0
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:09.380
And this one.

84a777f3-44df-4a8b-be32-80fbae348be0-0
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.890
This boat seems to be picked up
by a submarine.

667561a8-fef7-4289-b560-ad9df4ae0e82-0
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.080
And as we are.

d9897d90-a640-46fc-b1ee-29e2fe51a57e-0
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.363
Looking at the boat picking up,
being picked up by the

d9897d90-a640-46fc-b1ee-29e2fe51a57e-1
00:47:21.363 --> 00:47:23.650
submarine, there are a number of
other.

91b8b77f-9054-4ab2-bd04-a52a842473fd-0
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:29.397
creatures that have lights
coming out of them, possibly

91b8b77f-9054-4ab2-bd04-a52a842473fd-1
00:47:29.397 --> 00:47:33.220
from their eyes, and there is a
number of.

358550eb-f804-4316-a5b6-9e5bd25c6f15-0
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:37.640
creatures that are on top of the
little.

bbb9f8eb-dbbc-46f2-8a2d-18be581c6ede-0
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.289
boat here are three of these
creatures. They look like they

bbb9f8eb-dbbc-46f2-8a2d-18be581c6ede-1
00:47:43.289 --> 00:47:48.270
have legs and pointy antennae
all over them. And after that?

30b68260-6baa-4e58-a59e-fda4803dee2d-0
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.010
They are.

5aa15f31-bf97-485c-82b4-875094427249-0
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:57.400
Let's see, the boat had water in
it and it's pouring the water

5aa15f31-bf97-485c-82b4-875094427249-1
00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:02.055
out as it's as the submarine
picks it up out of the ocean, it

5aa15f31-bf97-485c-82b4-875094427249-2
00:48:02.055 --> 00:48:05.510
can pour out the water that it
has picked up.

656bf033-8b06-4f37-a9db-ced0bf8844a4-0
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.320
And we see another ship.

815679b0-4ed7-4c92-92e2-9fea89510116-0
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.610
And we see what looks like a
giant octopus that looks almost

815679b0-4ed7-4c92-92e2-9fea89510116-1
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:14.410
like it is.

b211562f-6bf9-4275-b302-f35656beed6c-0
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.110
Eating this ship it's not clear
to me, but.

4e77cce6-2858-423c-b3e7-6eaed646ec93-0
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:25.380
It looks like the ship is in
some danger from this giant

4e77cce6-2858-423c-b3e7-6eaed646ec93-1
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.460
octopus and the boat is
continuing on sailing on.

2bafe445-4fb0-4aeb-95e0-913ba9099ef0-0
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.026
Now we have some seals that have
seen the boat and they are

2bafe445-4fb0-4aeb-95e0-913ba9099ef0-1
00:48:36.026 --> 00:48:40.012
playing with it. They have it
tipped on its side with their

2bafe445-4fb0-4aeb-95e0-913ba9099ef0-2
00:48:40.012 --> 00:48:43.467
little snouts. There are a
number of seals that are

2bafe445-4fb0-4aeb-95e0-913ba9099ef0-3
00:48:43.467 --> 00:48:47.320
swimming along in the ocean,
some that are outside of the

2bafe445-4fb0-4aeb-95e0-913ba9099ef0-4
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.506
ocean playing with the little
boat, and they are right next to

2bafe445-4fb0-4aeb-95e0-913ba9099ef0-5
00:48:51.506 --> 00:48:55.360
what looks like a garden of
ferns in the ocean with some.

ec5ab27b-5788-47a7-abbc-adefb9e299fa-0
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.130
Fish in there.

8267c611-2e5b-4073-adcb-8c34dd6be9c6-0
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.194
Now I guess the seals have left
the boat. Continue to sail along

8267c611-2e5b-4073-adcb-8c34dd6be9c6-1
00:49:05.194 --> 00:49:09.135
and we do see some jellyfish
underneath the ocean, some

8267c611-2e5b-4073-adcb-8c34dd6be9c6-2
00:49:09.135 --> 00:49:13.639
beautiful plants, some fish. We
see a man dressed up in a scuba

8267c611-2e5b-4073-adcb-8c34dd6be9c6-3
00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:18.003
suit way underneath the ocean
and we see some amazing looking

8267c611-2e5b-4073-adcb-8c34dd6be9c6-4
00:49:18.003 --> 00:49:21.099
creatures, eel like creatures
with stripes.

c5f573e3-b903-484f-ab57-88c633d0d0a0-0
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.798
It's not clear what the scuba
man is doing, but he looks like

c5f573e3-b903-484f-ab57-88c633d0d0a0-1
00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:26.520
he's playing with them with the
ball.

f8154b4a-3969-441f-b7f0-8eea29df313e-0
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.420
There's a lot of amazing plants
in this scene.

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-0
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.105
As the boat continues on we see
a buoy and a number of

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-1
00:49:40.105 --> 00:49:45.068
preachers, fantastical looking
creatures hanging on to the buoy

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-2
00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:49.876
along with the man and the scuba
suit who seemed to be riding

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-3
00:49:49.876 --> 00:49:54.761
another creature and some sort
of a fish looking creature that

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-4
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:58.871
has stripes and a beautiful
tail. The seagulls are a

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-5
00:49:58.871 --> 00:50:03.136
lighting on top of the buoy and
we are going towards a

ddf4703d-65c8-45c2-8589-0ba7879febe5-6
00:50:03.136 --> 00:50:03.990
lighthouse.

01fc4170-2aa8-4903-87a6-77c344703ebc-0
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:08.260
In the background we have a few
ships that are passing by.

02b55f48-d138-49de-9e47-580b4989167e-0
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.652
Looks like there's somebody on
the little island that has the

02b55f48-d138-49de-9e47-580b4989167e-1
00:50:13.652 --> 00:50:14.260
lighthouse.

91b19c3a-96c7-4354-8713-c51a93ee4543-0
00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.350
In this frame we see.

bcdba74f-ba5e-4479-96bd-a00677cad773-0
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:28.269
An amazing structure that the
boat is passing. It looks like

bcdba74f-ba5e-4479-96bd-a00677cad773-1
00:50:28.269 --> 00:50:30.670
some sort of a giant bridge.

2c905709-cf41-40f4-972c-9c074e6892fe-0
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:39.327
It's multi, let's see. There are
a number of boats all around,

2c905709-cf41-40f4-972c-9c074e6892fe-1
00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:44.619
and it looks like it's some sort
of a docking station for a

2c905709-cf41-40f4-972c-9c074e6892fe-2
00:50:44.619 --> 00:50:46.560
number of large boats.

ba98ade6-22da-48f8-a6a0-0797af64c96e-0
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.958
tall sailing ship in the
background we have see a smaller

ba98ade6-22da-48f8-a6a0-0797af64c96e-1
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:57.504
sailing ship, we see an ocean
liner and again they're

ba98ade6-22da-48f8-a6a0-0797af64c96e-2
00:50:57.504 --> 00:51:01.575
beautiful plants in the ocean
and a number of schools of fish

ba98ade6-22da-48f8-a6a0-0797af64c96e-3
00:51:01.575 --> 00:51:02.560
swimming along.

11159c70-2bc0-4656-b12e-b61fee8eb435-0
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:12.630
The little boat is continuing
onward and we see a.

5d8921b4-217c-495d-9db9-17fbc8ffa26a-0
00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:18.584
Some sort of a ship that has a
propeller and it's it looks like

5d8921b4-217c-495d-9db9-17fbc8ffa26a-1
00:51:18.584 --> 00:51:22.423
it's holding on to a little
sailboat that it can bring with

5d8921b4-217c-495d-9db9-17fbc8ffa26a-2
00:51:22.423 --> 00:51:26.517
it. We've got some birds flying
in the air and it looks like we

5d8921b4-217c-495d-9db9-17fbc8ffa26a-3
00:51:26.517 --> 00:51:29.716
are going towards a city.
There's a submarine way

5d8921b4-217c-495d-9db9-17fbc8ffa26a-4
00:51:29.716 --> 00:51:30.419
underneath.

63596468-ce97-49cd-a38d-00528bef2204-0
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:36.265
We are passing a giant ocean
liner that is taking up more

63596468-ce97-49cd-a38d-00528bef2204-1
00:51:36.265 --> 00:51:40.320
most of this page as it
continues on towards the city.

85230c04-9008-4255-93ab-058871b4bb80-0
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:51.020
a giant creature that looks like
a whale. A whale that has water

85230c04-9008-4255-93ab-058871b4bb80-1
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:56.102
flowing on it from some sort of
a device that it is encased in.

85230c04-9008-4255-93ab-058871b4bb80-2
00:51:56.102 --> 00:52:00.866
And we see a little boat with a
little motorboat with three

85230c04-9008-4255-93ab-058871b4bb80-3
00:52:00.866 --> 00:52:05.788
people on it. We see a buoy and
we see a A a smaller ship and

85230c04-9008-4255-93ab-058871b4bb80-4
00:52:05.788 --> 00:52:10.393
then a very large ocean liner
and a number of people that

85230c04-9008-4255-93ab-058871b4bb80-5
00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:12.220
looks like on the dock.

181d8e37-b5b5-447f-a325-00d006e7e391-0
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:16.706
Waiting for the ocean liner to
come. It's not clear to me, but

181d8e37-b5b5-447f-a325-00d006e7e391-1
00:52:16.706 --> 00:52:19.370
it looks like they are on a dock
and.

66408ddb-a2d6-4638-9c04-191d1effe2b1-0
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.147
There are some seagulls flying
and the little boat is

66408ddb-a2d6-4638-9c04-191d1effe2b1-1
00:52:23.147 --> 00:52:24.110
continuing onward.

f0ded28e-9ca9-45ef-9292-eaffe5ccae6f-0
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:26.620
Hmm.

6b6d13f8-39d9-47ab-84c6-d6ae67660d56-0
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:33.914
We are now getting closer to the
city, so we're starting to see

6b6d13f8-39d9-47ab-84c6-d6ae67660d56-1
00:52:33.914 --> 00:52:35.160
some fabulous 

9b997f23-8b48-4639-b590-d051d8147396-0
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.170
 constructions.

810e508f-400e-4361-8b39-a2fb2b3767cc-0
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:43.862
And there's some cranes, and
there are a number of people

810e508f-400e-4361-8b39-a2fb2b3767cc-1
00:52:43.862 --> 00:52:49.073
along the side doing various
things, walking up steps, two

810e508f-400e-4361-8b39-a2fb2b3767cc-2
00:52:49.073 --> 00:52:54.550
people talking. We have ladders
and we have a person inside a

810e508f-400e-4361-8b39-a2fb2b3767cc-3
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.610
bubble with.

659777a3-e5b1-49b7-afba-6d6c0d6d2d62-0
00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.180
It's a very unusual looking.

223dcebd-4866-41e8-80b1-29c5b2edd9d8-0
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.207
mechanical machine that looks
sort of like a seahorse, but

223dcebd-4866-41e8-80b1-29c5b2edd9d8-1
00:53:04.207 --> 00:53:08.252
then has a glass bubble on the
top and there's a person inside

223dcebd-4866-41e8-80b1-29c5b2edd9d8-2
00:53:08.252 --> 00:53:11.911
of it and it looks like he can
take this into the water,

223dcebd-4866-41e8-80b1-29c5b2edd9d8-3
00:53:11.911 --> 00:53:14.480
possibly like some sort of a
submarine.

95c443a1-339f-46c2-a78f-0d171b1c394d-0
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:25.233
And we continue onward and we
see the boat going by what looks

95c443a1-339f-46c2-a78f-0d171b1c394d-1
00:53:25.233 --> 00:53:25.780
like.

870aff49-512f-4655-82e0-14ea0901871d-0
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.319
Our little boat is going by
another, another little bit

870aff49-512f-4655-82e0-14ea0901871d-1
00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:34.047
larger boat, of course, than he
is. But there's a dog and

870aff49-512f-4655-82e0-14ea0901871d-2
00:53:34.047 --> 00:53:38.097
there's a person on. There are
two dogs on the boat that looks

870aff49-512f-4655-82e0-14ea0901871d-3
00:53:38.097 --> 00:53:42.211
like a sailor. On the boat there
is what looks like a giant net

870aff49-512f-4655-82e0-14ea0901871d-4
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:43.240
that is holding.

696d7c5b-3de3-4edf-9b26-6b46e949eecc-0
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.040
A giant fish of some sort that
they have caught.

77228969-8d7c-4784-87e3-c0a4d0ffdc69-0
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:50.090
In the net and there are some
seagulls.

0b8930a8-5216-4d36-a9b6-13c267348d2f-0
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.430
Standing on top of.

91763b3b-bf80-4560-9305-65c85086a9f8-0
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.491
That creature and there's a
giant. There's a crane that's

91763b3b-bf80-4560-9305-65c85086a9f8-1
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:57.410
holding the net.

623f2fb7-5898-4579-aa20-230b17b13f80-0
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.135
It's not clear what they have
caught in this net, but it looks

623f2fb7-5898-4579-aa20-230b17b13f80-1
00:54:03.135 --> 00:54:06.922
like a very big type of creature
of some sort, maybe like a

623f2fb7-5898-4579-aa20-230b17b13f80-2
00:54:06.922 --> 00:54:10.519
dragon type of creature that
they have gotten out of the

623f2fb7-5898-4579-aa20-230b17b13f80-3
00:54:10.519 --> 00:54:14.052
ocean and the little boat
continues on and there is the

623f2fb7-5898-4579-aa20-230b17b13f80-4
00:54:14.052 --> 00:54:17.649
rest of the city that we're
going by with buildings and.

3522b469-e54a-499f-9840-fa3ea4a977ad-0
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:22.515
 see a man that has come down
the steps towards the boat and

3522b469-e54a-499f-9840-fa3ea4a977ad-1
00:54:22.515 --> 00:54:23.800
there are some seagulls.

3ef466f6-de1c-4149-b53f-d41868d4841b-0
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.450
Going around in that area.

1e81464f-7270-44c8-8da3-325e421254ac-0
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.800
And looking at a giant.

f4db2f08-fd7f-4116-a782-75b1856db059-0
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:31.710
A picture of the city.

4ddc0728-c0d5-49a7-a5c5-4a56848f4f26-0
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:36.120
With lots of lights in the
buildings and lots of.

9afa6409-78d3-41d0-8772-78c74425b546-0
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.866
Let's see, creatures. Let's see,
it looks like we have what looks

9afa6409-78d3-41d0-8772-78c74425b546-1
00:54:41.866 --> 00:54:46.278
like a deer. A giant deer. On
top of one of the buildings. We

9afa6409-78d3-41d0-8772-78c74425b546-2
00:54:46.278 --> 00:54:50.974
have a creature that seems to be
flying around with the propeller

9afa6409-78d3-41d0-8772-78c74425b546-3
00:54:50.974 --> 00:54:53.750
and wings and dark skin he looks
like.

87e2ef40-34de-44cf-a3f5-e10b69810c2c-0
00:54:55.610 --> 00:55:00.410
Half fish, half man, half who
knows what. And we've got a lot

87e2ef40-34de-44cf-a3f5-e10b69810c2c-1
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:04.978
of towers in the city, a lot of
lights in the city, a bird

87e2ef40-34de-44cf-a3f5-e10b69810c2c-2
00:55:04.978 --> 00:55:09.546
flying by, some pigeons looking
onward. As the little boat

87e2ef40-34de-44cf-a3f5-e10b69810c2c-3
00:55:09.546 --> 00:55:14.423
continues on through the city,
it looks like a river that goes

87e2ef40-34de-44cf-a3f5-e10b69810c2c-4
00:55:14.423 --> 00:55:15.739
through the city.

b69641ec-68f5-4290-be95-d26ba99d90f8-0
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:19.200


62a381cb-6653-4ff4-99bc-f5416707f3b4-0
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.523
and again we're seeing some
amazing looking creatures. The

62a381cb-6653-4ff4-99bc-f5416707f3b4-1
00:55:24.523 --> 00:55:28.841
scuba man. We see the Nautilus
boat with the kite and that the

62a381cb-6653-4ff4-99bc-f5416707f3b4-2
00:55:28.841 --> 00:55:31.720
creatures that were on the
Nautilus boat.

7eb038e2-c479-45bf-b3e8-563eb3675893-0
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.620
The cat and the little. The
little people and.

2fad33e8-e7f0-416d-af34-26c40f899aa4-0
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:42.167
The reindeer with stars on it
and the the horse that has white

2fad33e8-e7f0-416d-af34-26c40f899aa4-1
00:55:42.167 --> 00:55:46.849
dots on it that what looks like
the evil looking man with the

2fad33e8-e7f0-416d-af34-26c40f899aa4-2
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:51.229
robe. And again the little boat
is sailing by these these

2fad33e8-e7f0-416d-af34-26c40f899aa4-3
00:55:51.229 --> 00:55:56.138
creatures as it goes through an
archway through the city on this

2fad33e8-e7f0-416d-af34-26c40f899aa4-4
00:55:56.138 --> 00:55:57.120
Little River.

ffa15061-7e49-4d60-b5ea-0e988024848d-0

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:08.024
So this scene, it's night and
the boat continues sailing on

049d291c-5781-477d-b3f8-c80e3cd62d0e-1
00:56:08.024 --> 00:56:12.607
and it we're seeing a lot of
stars in the sky and there are a

049d291c-5781-477d-b3f8-c80e3cd62d0e-2
00:56:12.607 --> 00:56:13.790
few boats along.

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:19.129
The river that are quiet now
since it's dark and we see some

2c4a5903-1a4c-4d4b-ac14-162d42824d39-1
00:56:19.129 --> 00:56:23.745
fish with glowing eyes looking
onward you see some of the, you

2c4a5903-1a4c-4d4b-ac14-162d42824d39-2
00:56:23.745 --> 00:56:26.090
know, lights of the night lamps.

2cb30a70-0bef-4a3e-832d-b0d04e7171a1-0
00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.190
By this Little River has the
boat continues on.

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:37.320
And finally, we see the boat.

875bc15e-3d50-4cad-a149-7cd276d9fbd7-0
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.240
Coming to.

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.550
Edge of the river to a wall.

e978446f-6ec2-409f-876d-29da4a57af22-0
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:53.441
And it looks like it's coming to
the wall and preacher a man of

e978446f-6ec2-409f-876d-29da4a57af22-1
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:54.900
some sort is.

44a68227-e615-4d67-805f-32181704aeb5-0
00:56:56.170 --> 00:57:00.462
standing with the boat and it's
disappearing and it's going

44a68227-e615-4d67-805f-32181704aeb5-1
00:57:00.462 --> 00:57:00.820
into.

62e08bef-a927-490a-82af-ddd9aaeeddeb-0
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.270
it's going on to the man And
that's the end.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:12.590
the man going up the steps with
a picture of the boat on his

5d6e7ef2-5f59-4a7a-aa87-8030b7507316-1
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:18.725
chest and we see some feet black
and white feet at the top of the

5d6e7ef2-5f59-4a7a-aa87-8030b7507316-2
00:57:18.725 --> 00:57:19.190
wall.

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:26.103
Looks like the boat was an
imaginary item that was part of

f2f3f00f-4cff-4679-952f-749669f7d782-1
00:57:26.103 --> 00:57:26.430
this.

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:34.930
I'm gonna take a break.

51bd8d79-221c-4a5c-987e-a136cbd367cb-0
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:41.357
Alright, so for the next item,
it is also a complex scene. And

51bd8d79-221c-4a5c-987e-a136cbd367cb-1
00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:45.616
yeah, go ahead and describe what
you see in the scene and take

51bd8d79-221c-4a5c-987e-a136cbd367cb-2
00:57:45.616 --> 00:57:47.780
between three and five minutes.

6888316d-d72c-439f-ae77-b5b5176affc8-0

00:57:55.070 --> 00:58:00.236
Seems like near the ocean. It's
a beach scene with many, many

36e90851-5c32-4882-92b5-e564d40e57af-1
00:58:00.236 --> 00:58:05.236
people on the beach and in the
water doing all sorts of fun

36e90851-5c32-4882-92b5-e564d40e57af-2
00:58:05.236 --> 00:58:08.820
things. It looks like we have
some people.

68b0868d-9411-495c-8ba0-894a9fca9c9d-0
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:11.980

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:18.100
We also have people on the beach
building sandcastles.

16850af6-4447-4bbf-9282-6d2f0faba18b-0
00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:19.510

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:43.735
Place in the water that they can
sit on and also jump off of.

b90b8d15-09a0-4dae-bde0-bc16555536a7-1
00:58:43.735 --> 00:58:48.715
Let's see. Let me think here.
What have we got going on? We

b90b8d15-09a0-4dae-bde0-bc16555536a7-2
00:58:48.715 --> 00:58:49.130

Some people playing beach
volleyball, some people just

e0499130-ac63-4c01-899f-2ed0f775c922-1
00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:59.019
lying on the sand on blankets
and they have their coolers so

e0499130-ac63-4c01-899f-2ed0f775c922-2
00:58:59.019 --> 00:59:03.934
that they can get refreshments.
We have someone with a nut and

e0499130-ac63-4c01-899f-2ed0f775c922-3
00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:08.614
it looks like he is looking for
things near the edge of the

e0499130-ac63-4c01-899f-2ed0f775c922-4
00:59:08.614 --> 00:59:13.451

people on a kayak and we have
some people flying kites.

00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:23.214
we have some people sitting
around and playing the guitar

94423279-4ea5-4f76-a19c-29e91a01e98a-1
00:59:23.214 --> 00:59:24.180
and singing.

778ef0a9-6f1f-491b-b97e-6be365f658cb-0
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:26.750


25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-0
00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.627
we've got so many things going
on here because there's a lot of

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-1
00:59:32.627 --> 00:59:36.887
people in this scene. You have
people far off in the distance,

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-2
00:59:36.887 --> 00:59:41.080
sitting at a picnic table and
enjoying some food and grilling

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-3
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.272
some food on a little grill and
they have, it looks like they

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-4
00:59:45.272 --> 00:59:49.397
have a little house by the water
that they can look out with

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-5
00:59:49.397 --> 00:59:53.657
binoculars onto what's going on
in the water. We have a number

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-6
00:59:53.657 --> 00:59:57.782
of people on various types of
boats, all sorts of boats wind

25907172-0cea-488d-b848-ffef3330eba2-7
00:59:57.782 --> 00:59:59.000
surfing, kayaking.

43fb71bf-8e18-474b-b04f-7761dfe1f424-0
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:05.812
Let's see far away background.
We have other houses that are

43fb71bf-8e18-474b-b04f-7761dfe1f424-1
01:00:05.812 --> 01:00:10.323
along the coast. One looks
almost like a little castle

43fb71bf-8e18-474b-b04f-7761dfe1f424-2
01:00:10.323 --> 01:00:15.736
along the coast. We have so many
things going on, people swimming

43fb71bf-8e18-474b-b04f-7761dfe1f424-3
01:00:15.736 --> 01:00:20.820
and swimming and swimming and
people on floating items of all

43fb71bf-8e18-474b-b04f-7761dfe1f424-4
01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:25.659
sorts and playing volleyball in
the water. We have someone

43fb71bf-8e18-474b-b04f-7761dfe1f424-5
01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:29.760
fishing off of the dock. We have
a we have a dog.

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-0
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.756
Near the water there. And we
have what looks like a little

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-1
01:00:33.756 --> 01:00:38.071
Penguin sitting on the dock, and
it looks like he's fishing. And

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-2
01:00:38.071 --> 01:00:41.788
let's see so many different
things. People playing with

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-3
01:00:41.788 --> 01:00:45.838
balls and people just playing
with their their fellow men on

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-4
01:00:45.838 --> 01:00:50.086
the water. And on the beach. It
looks like somebody does have a

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-5
01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:54.268
little computer with them. That
seems kind of odd, but that is

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-6
01:00:54.268 --> 01:00:58.318
something somebody might do. We
have people, there's a trash

492bacab-7aea-49e5-adde-313a34813c04-7
01:00:58.318 --> 01:01:01.039
can, people putting things in
the trash.

3ff670c8-2e68-4e94-8ed7-89ed04ad9e29-0
01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:05.346
Which is good,
and I think that's it. But it's

3ff670c8-2e68-4e94-8ed7-89ed04ad9e29-1
01:01:05.346 --> 01:01:09.450
it's a definitely a very busy
scene of people doing all sorts

3ff670c8-2e68-4e94-8ed7-89ed04ad9e29-2
01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:13.621
of water sports and water skiing
and windsurfing, all sorts of

3ff670c8-2e68-4e94-8ed7-89ed04ad9e29-3
01:01:13.621 --> 01:01:17.130
things, just enjoying the water
in the summer scene. #END_by_the_lake 

b11027bc-b486-418a-bb87-7feaaa52f0c3-0
01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.180
3 1/2 minutes. That was good.

8e0daa82-f01a-4afe-97a8-b8875e9b3741-0
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:25.750
Hey, going forward, another
complex scene.

bdc0bc71-9d69-42ec-bfca-15d964f84147-0
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.542
#START_unfriendly_giants OK,
this is another very, very busy

bdc0bc71-9d69-42ec-bfca-15d964f84147-1
01:01:31.542 --> 01:01:33.160
scene and it looks like it has.

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-0
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.924
Friendly and unfriendly giants
in the scene. It is a scene that

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-1
01:01:38.924 --> 01:01:43.241
looks like it has a lot of
forest and let's see, a lot of

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-2
01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:47.633
fields. And these giants are
doing all sorts of things. It

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-3
01:01:47.633 --> 01:01:51.876
looks like they are playing
chess with people on a chess

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-4
01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:56.789
board. But it looks like instead
of playing with a game of chess,

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-5
01:01:56.789 --> 01:02:01.032
they're actually playing with
little people on the chess

30131649-6467-49a6-99ec-d34a1f791c85-6
01:02:01.032 --> 01:02:04.010
board. Let's see, there are.
Let's see.

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-0
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:08.422
One giant is going over to what
looks like is a picture of a

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-1
01:02:08.422 --> 01:02:12.705
maiden that is painted on a big
board and it looks like he's

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-2
01:02:12.705 --> 01:02:17.127
getting ready to kiss her and it
is some sort of a contraption

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-3
01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:21.199
that looks like it's going to
hit him on the head when he

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-4
01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:25.482
actually does kiss her. And we
have one giant walking and as

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-5
01:02:25.482 --> 01:02:29.764
he's walking he is has a rope
tied around his foot and many,

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-6
01:02:29.764 --> 01:02:34.187
many people hanging on to that
rope I think they are trying to

4b231de3-5fe2-42b0-9414-bd4af699201a-7
01:02:34.187 --> 01:02:34.960
capture him

cdca747e-3a7e-4b5b-8aeb-640de794506e-0
01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.440
But it's not easy to do because
he's so much bigger than they

cdca747e-3a7e-4b5b-8aeb-640de794506e-1
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.950
are and he is holding 3.

0cf280d7-1eef-49cc-8e5f-7fad9947b008-0
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.957
Attached to his belt. And so
maybe they are trying to rescue

0cf280d7-1eef-49cc-8e5f-7fad9947b008-1
01:02:45.957 --> 01:02:50.270
those people that he is holding
and we also have a lot of other.

ecf330a3-d55e-4706-a8d1-f7507f7efc9d-0
01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:54.283
Giants doing other sorts of
things. Let's see, what are they

ecf330a3-d55e-4706-a8d1-f7507f7efc9d-1
01:02:54.283 --> 01:02:54.600
doing?

2fa237e2-8c85-4a51-9ca2-0304b6517f30-0
01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:01.368
See this one giant is blowing
water on a group of people.

2fa237e2-8c85-4a51-9ca2-0304b6517f30-1
01:03:01.368 --> 01:03:07.751
Another giant is sucking up
water, it looks like from a pond

2fa237e2-8c85-4a51-9ca2-0304b6517f30-2
01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:08.170
and.

18792dd4-38b2-45f9-a9ee-8c75a856a827-0
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:09.980
The little.

44db8696-3c20-426f-97be-f13f3cac1406-0
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.629
We have, of course we've got the
giants and then we have the

44db8696-3c20-426f-97be-f13f3cac1406-1
01:03:14.629 --> 01:03:18.090
normal sized human beings and it
looks like it's a big.

c0d9fc99-f4e8-4270-91b5-7407cb9c0f89-0
01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.416
or trying to fight against these
giants, and it's not easy.

c0d9fc99-f4e8-4270-91b5-7407cb9c0f89-1
01:03:24.416 --> 01:03:27.999
They're doing all sorts of
things. They have swords.

c0d9fc99-f4e8-4270-91b5-7407cb9c0f89-2
01:03:27.999 --> 01:03:32.258
They're gathering on Moss to go
after these giants. It doesn't

c0d9fc99-f4e8-4270-91b5-7407cb9c0f89-3
01:03:32.258 --> 01:03:36.247
seem like it's working that
well, though I must admit they

c0d9fc99-f4e8-4270-91b5-7407cb9c0f89-4
01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:40.438
do have a number of contraptions
that are designed to hit the

c0d9fc99-f4e8-4270-91b5-7407cb9c0f89-5
01:03:40.438 --> 01:03:44.630
giants in the head, and those
seem to be working pretty well.

c5ba999d-6f28-422c-8f8d-be66234e1dff-0
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.750
Let's see so many different.

618c5c24-9c9e-43a4-bdd6-b15963749fc5-0
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:52.880
Let's see, we've got a windmill,
we've got a giant.

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-0
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:59.251
When you think something to the
window, it looks like he's

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-1
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:03.526
pushing the arms of the windmill
around. He has a stone house in

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-2
01:04:03.526 --> 01:04:07.473
the background with a lot of
regular sized human beings all

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-3
01:04:07.473 --> 01:04:11.420
around. They're trying to fight
against the Giants, and the

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-4
01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:15.498
Giants are coming up against
them and they're being one giant

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-5
01:04:15.498 --> 01:04:19.314
is being hit with a rock,
another being is being hit with

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-6
01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:23.063
a large wooden mallet. That
seems to work pretty well as

46b6f450-706e-4a53-a460-033e9114483f-7
01:04:23.063 --> 01:04:25.300
we've got another giant that
has.

de425554-7158-47da-ba76-1bd566f2c131-0
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:32.337
The tiny humans around his waist
and in his hood of his tunic.

de425554-7158-47da-ba76-1bd566f2c131-1
01:04:32.337 --> 01:04:34.590
Let's see, we've got.

bc865b3d-812a-460c-aa6a-ab17eb90ebef-0
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.040
Again, humans are trying to
fight these giants.

235b4637-28b4-4070-9c61-25a050c1dc54-0
01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.657
It looks
like we have got a number of

235b4637-28b4-4070-9c61-25a050c1dc54-1
01:04:41.657 --> 01:04:44.534
these little humans holding a
giant punching bag and they're

235b4637-28b4-4070-9c61-25a050c1dc54-2
01:04:44.534 --> 01:04:47.270
punching one of the giants. That
seems to work very well. #END_unfriendly_giants 

4f67dd47-1718-4121-a7bb-6f19a04ee5c6-0
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.300
That scene, that was about 3
minutes. OK, that's good. OK.

8958e640-ef4d-4d24-9f0d-ab65fcc6d9a0-0
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:59.361
Going ahead, we have a story
that's around 20 pages long, so

8958e640-ef4d-4d24-9f0d-ab65fcc6d9a0-1
01:04:59.361 --> 01:05:04.114
please take between 10 and 15
minutes and I'll let you know

8958e640-ef4d-4d24-9f0d-ab65fcc6d9a0-2
01:05:04.114 --> 01:05:06.650
when we're about 10 minutes in.

5aa0f161-0d10-4e53-be11-5ab6bbe9f54f-0
01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:17.743
#START_quest We are seeing a
scene of a bench next to a light

5aa0f161-0d10-4e53-be11-5ab6bbe9f54f-1
01:05:17.743 --> 01:05:23.739
pole and a trash can, and there
is a statue of a person with

5aa0f161-0d10-4e53-be11-5ab6bbe9f54f-2
01:05:23.739 --> 01:05:25.999
wings, a winged person.

c0d0ed7a-fd28-44d0-b6fa-7e964070d6df-0
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:32.461
with a It looks like some sort
of a tunic and next in the next

c0d0ed7a-fd28-44d0-b6fa-7e964070d6df-1
01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:36.890
page we have a bicycle with a
purple and a red.

46cb2617-7a7e-49e2-a919-0f321b24e9ea-0
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.470
wheel and we have.

9ba7e103-1289-4829-ace8-2445c82703e5-0
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:47.238
Two youngsters, one with a red
crayon and another one with a

9ba7e103-1289-4829-ace8-2445c82703e5-1

779be03b-bf3a-4871-85f7-5239c07fe3d8-2
01:07:17.365 --> 01:07:21.945
and the purple bird is still on
the sole on the shoulder of the

purple key and a red key that

fd706805-1a37-4630-825e-5897f6f82957-3
01:07:44.317 --> 01:07:47.298
they have drawn with their

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:21.983
amazing. It has a lot of
different turrets and there are

e75cfa29-51b3-4169-9988-8ae28ec1e900-4
01:08:21.983 --> 01:08:24.300
flying machines in the air.

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:28.745
And they are sort of sitting
right in front of a waterfall

0698b78a-0718-4154-8cce-c164c80d1e67-1
01:08:28.745 --> 01:08:30.110

As they're looking at this map,
they're also staring at a boat

34aa1abb-8cef-4a63-8781-68d2a181ac73-1
01:09:10.086 --> 01:09:14.218

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.389
And they're looking at the
number of crayons that they have

005d4252-f894-4581-b345-429afd7ad100-1
01:12:46.389 --> 01:12:49.780
in different colors while
they're on top of this pagoda.

f604ef95-1843-4b1a-9fae-888e52a1c93d-0
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:56.636
And meanwhile the guards are
still after them. They are on

f604ef95-1843-4b1a-9fae-888e52a1c93d-1
01:12:56.636 --> 01:13:00.700
some flying ships and they are
looking towards them with

f604ef95-1843-4b1a-9fae-888e52a1c93d-2
01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.200
Spears.

3e17444d-c353-4941-af1c-6e88acc4e9fa-0
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:05.778
And they're looking to grasp the
purple bird because they have a

3e17444d-c353-4941-af1c-6e88acc4e9fa-1
01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:08.800
golden cage that they want to
put that bird into.

87011979-5643-4771-b9d7-ba6879fc6efb-0
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:15.830
Now

c23fec08-ebb2-4d10-ac29-6d10a152d82e-0
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:21.204
The Purple Bird has a hold of
the belt that has all the multi

c23fec08-ebb2-4d10-ac29-6d10a152d82e-1
01:13:21.204 --> 01:13:23.240
colored crayons and he has.

c102e113-66b9-4dd9-acf3-7a92dd1245c2-0
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:31.031
{Excuse me, } he has made a
rainbow with all of these colors

c102e113-66b9-4dd9-acf3-7a92dd1245c2-1
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:31.420
and.

c9b35c76-cdb0-4bb4-91ef-cea5eb8e9e40-0
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:34.170
The guard seemed to be.

3c6544c4-2c0a-4392-ba63-7d3b1181d25f-0
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:36.470
Very upset about this.

182ec0e0-8e87-46cf-9d0c-1989e93f2cc1-0
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.620
With the rainbow.

ff8b1607-6fe5-4a3b-a796-39d54e111071-0
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.839
Has come across from where they
are all the way down to where

ff8b1607-6fe5-4a3b-a796-39d54e111071-1
01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:51.550
the king is, and it has.

30ca7f55-f2ad-4a51-a337-bccedb588c7b-0
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:55.270
Seems to have some magical
powers to.

a3e9d168-14ec-4bcc-a4db-02b2be134a2d-0
01:13:56.130 --> 01:14:00.685
Keeps the guards from grasping
onto the king and they are

a3e9d168-14ec-4bcc-a4db-02b2be134a2d-1
01:14:00.685 --> 01:14:03.120
actually flying into the water.

a0d30eac-c040-42b2-aaad-da89386e6437-0
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:05.960
So it seems to have some magical
power.

f98219cc-70b0-47b3-995c-ce9949707a23-0
01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:08.760
To hurt the guards.

cca7faf3-a5bc-4f68-905c-58e914da38fc-0
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:15.850
At this point.

7267fc73-375a-4f2a-9e00-b01247e34332-0
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:22.378
We see the youngsters on the
purple rhinoceros with the king

7267fc73-375a-4f2a-9e00-b01247e34332-1
01:14:22.378 --> 01:14:24.710
and the purple bird flying.

818b0cfa-87b6-4346-ab6b-f52f47bf79f3-0
01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:31.285
behind them, and the rainbow has
lit up the whole city with

818b0cfa-87b6-4346-ab6b-f52f47bf79f3-1
01:14:31.285 --> 01:14:31.800
color.

dc4de362-4697-4ef8-a1ca-e5960da75b2a-0
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.610
At this point.

d5d7294f-7304-4734-abca-dcbbdb4b126b-0
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.619
They are getting off of the
rhinoceros and they are back to

d5d7294f-7304-4734-abca-dcbbdb4b126b-1
01:14:46.619 --> 01:14:50.360
the point where they started
with the waterfall and the rock.

8c3bc264-7ec9-41d4-9ac7-0a9b02310290-0
01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.130
And they are coming through the
door.

b2c5862a-681c-4a62-93a3-5c73152c91fa-0
01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.730
And the king.

1f75506e-a6e3-4e72-97fa-8c5af14c2614-0
01:14:57.650 --> 01:15:01.602
Is making a crown for both of
them. He is drawing a crown and

1f75506e-a6e3-4e72-97fa-8c5af14c2614-1
01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:05.300
he's crowning both of them and
they go back to looks like

1f75506e-a6e3-4e72-97fa-8c5af14c2614-2
01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.317
they're going to get ready to go
back through the door and the

1f75506e-a6e3-4e72-97fa-8c5af14c2614-3
01:15:09.317 --> 01:15:10.719
king is thanking them.

ccf62b07-bdd3-47ea-81b3-abe04b459938-0
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.230
It looks like that's
the end. They have their crowns

ccf62b07-bdd3-47ea-81b3-abe04b459938-1
01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.210
and they're looking out into the
city with a giant rainbow, and

ccf62b07-bdd3-47ea-81b3-abe04b459938-2
01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:21.004
they still have their purple
bird and their magical crayons

ccf62b07-bdd3-47ea-81b3-abe04b459938-3
01:15:21.004 --> 01:15:21.470
with them. #END_quest 

31cd6a7b-75a0-4e4a-9711-fe1dfb1af21d-0
01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:26.520
Took just around 10 minutes,
which is great.

9d7a89d5-c483-49f4-9a14-2c69e36b1f92-0
01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.310
Going on ahead and this is a
complex scene.

4c61f88d-beff-42bd-ba7e-fd72227b51ad-0
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.160
OK, we're doing a lot. Another
where's Waldo scene here and.

4e4b0d65-338f-4678-aa8a-e8a9e39337f4-0
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:47.311
Let's see. What is this scene?
What is this? This is. It looks

4e4b0d65-338f-4678-aa8a-e8a9e39337f4-1
01:15:47.311 --> 01:15:48.240
like it's.

2bc90fa3-a61d-4574-b89c-1d3fc959090d-0
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:54.097
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
A constructed scene of a space,

2bc90fa3-a61d-4574-b89c-1d3fc959090d-1
01:15:54.097 --> 01:15:57.853
bunch of spaceships in one area
and there is a volcano in

2bc90fa3-a61d-4574-b89c-1d3fc959090d-2
01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:01.803
another area that I'm seeing
some dinosaurs. So there's some

2bc90fa3-a61d-4574-b89c-1d3fc959090d-3
01:16:01.803 --> 01:16:05.429
dinosaurs in this area and
that's either are some other

2bc90fa3-a61d-4574-b89c-1d3fc959090d-4
01:16:05.429 --> 01:16:06.660
constructed scenes.

0838636a-62ca-4b8a-bb33-2227e8977a37-0
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:13.385
Let's see. We've got some
mummies in one area. We have

0838636a-62ca-4b8a-bb33-2227e8977a37-1
01:16:13.385 --> 01:16:18.903
what looks like a movie set in
another area, and some zombies

0838636a-62ca-4b8a-bb33-2227e8977a37-2
01:16:18.903 --> 01:16:24.332
and have all sorts of strange
creatures. One is looks like a

0838636a-62ca-4b8a-bb33-2227e8977a37-3
01:16:24.332 --> 01:16:26.380
tree that's come alive.

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-0
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:31.008
And we have what looks like a
cafeteria type setting where

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-1
01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:35.358
people are getting things to eat
and we have of course as it all

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-2
01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:39.441
wears Waldo areas, we have so
many people all over the place

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-3
01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:43.657
doing all sorts of things. So
let's see. And the volcano, they

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-4
01:16:43.657 --> 01:16:47.873
looks like there's some Cavemen
that are being shot out of the

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-5
01:16:47.873 --> 01:16:51.755
top of the volcano, some
pavement are flying down off the

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-6
01:16:51.755 --> 01:16:55.503
volcano and they're smaller
volcanoes coming off of the

6784fd20-2804-494e-9f6e-accb039386e4-7
01:16:55.503 --> 01:16:57.310
larger volcano we have got.

90857bbb-274f-45c3-a14b-a9e04dd3c676-0
01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:01.545
One caveman with a club that
looks like he's getting ready to

90857bbb-274f-45c3-a14b-a9e04dd3c676-1
01:17:01.545 --> 01:17:05.482
club a red dinosaur. We have a
green dinosaur and some Cavemen

90857bbb-274f-45c3-a14b-a9e04dd3c676-2
01:17:05.482 --> 01:17:07.420
are drawing pictures onto that.

d0d78324-ed27-4a01-bce7-49625bb90d1a-0
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:12.454
Green dinosaur. He doesn't seem
to mind. He seems happy. Then

d0d78324-ed27-4a01-bce7-49625bb90d1a-1
01:17:12.454 --> 01:17:16.839
there is a pink triceratops, it
looks like. And it looks like

d0d78324-ed27-4a01-bce7-49625bb90d1a-2
01:17:16.839 --> 01:17:20.870
the Cavemen are throwing rings
onto his horns as a game.

75ed2c07-b7d8-442b-9c13-9a9a5df6a3ac-0
01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:24.870
And there's a blue dinosaur,
there is a.

4dd1048c-149d-4af0-adaa-fe95d8e912b3-0
01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.225
Caveman that looks like a
dinosaur. It looks like he's

4dd1048c-149d-4af0-adaa-fe95d8e912b3-1
01:17:29.225 --> 01:17:33.354
taken off his head and there's a
dinosaur head underneath, and

4dd1048c-149d-4af0-adaa-fe95d8e912b3-2
01:17:33.354 --> 01:17:37.418
there's a pretend red dinosaur
where there's a man inside the

4dd1048c-149d-4af0-adaa-fe95d8e912b3-3
01:17:37.418 --> 01:17:41.088
dinosaur taking off the Red
dinosaur head. And it looks

4dd1048c-149d-4af0-adaa-fe95d8e912b3-4
01:17:41.088 --> 01:17:45.349
like, again, this is possibly a
big movie set where all kinds of

4dd1048c-149d-4af0-adaa-fe95d8e912b3-5
01:17:45.349 --> 01:17:47.250
unusual things are happening.

6900de30-a6ec-4367-a531-584c414e2d75-0
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.023
There's some other Cavemen that
are dreaming of dinosaurs, and

6900de30-a6ec-4367-a531-584c414e2d75-1
01:17:53.023 --> 01:17:57.266
there are dinosaurs dreaming of
female dinosaurs and Cavemen

6900de30-a6ec-4367-a531-584c414e2d75-2
01:17:57.266 --> 01:18:01.510
dreaming of women. Cavemen cave
women, I guess they would be

6900de30-a6ec-4367-a531-584c414e2d75-3
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:05.754
called. So we've got the whole
dinosaur series going on with

6900de30-a6ec-4367-a531-584c414e2d75-4
01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:08.119
the Cavemen in the one movie
set.

ba991b98-80fe-41d5-824a-c5020ededcb5-0
01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.062
And then we've got the ghouls
and it looks like the zombies

ba991b98-80fe-41d5-824a-c5020ededcb5-1
01:18:13.062 --> 01:18:15.810
walking around down here in the
bottom.

40fe4a23-9a9d-4447-a7fc-4985fb5c8006-0
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:20.461
That the other set and some
mummies. So that looks like it's

40fe4a23-9a9d-4447-a7fc-4985fb5c8006-1
01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:24.780
going to be a horror movie going
on down there. And we've got the

40fe4a23-9a9d-4447-a7fc-4985fb5c8006-2
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.641
makeup men working on putting
the makeup on the actors for

40fe4a23-9a9d-4447-a7fc-4985fb5c8006-3
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:32.960
this movie and we've got all the
costumes hanging on hangers that

40fe4a23-9a9d-4447-a7fc-4985fb5c8006-4
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.952
they can put on for the movie.
Let's see, let's move over to

40fe4a23-9a9d-4447-a7fc-4985fb5c8006-5
01:18:36.952 --> 01:18:40.290
the other side of the screen. We
have got a space.

77ead640-956a-45aa-ac8a-1a146bc3a6d7-0
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.122
Spaceships with aliens on them
and also it looks like

77ead640-956a-45aa-ac8a-1a146bc3a6d7-1
01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:49.390
astronauts of some sort, or
spacemen.

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-0
01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:56.963
Hurting other spacemen and
aliens, coming down and making

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-1
01:18:56.963 --> 01:19:01.198
friends with some of the
spacemen and fighting other

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-2
01:19:01.198 --> 01:19:05.992
spacemen. And we've got the
cameramen that are doing all of

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-3
01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:10.865
the movie work here. We've got
all sorts of cameras all over

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-4
01:19:10.865 --> 01:19:15.739
the place. We have people in
trees. We have people on top of

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-5
01:19:15.739 --> 01:19:20.932
cranes. We have people eating in
this cafeteria. I don't know if

55ce6b67-0f8a-456e-b4d9-657bcd75a568-6
01:19:20.932 --> 01:19:22.689
this is the cafeteria.

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-0
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.617
where the actors can go to get
something to eat, but there it

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-1
01:19:26.617 --> 01:19:30.411
looks like they can get pie
there. There are some big pieces

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-2
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:34.206
of pie. People are eating all
sorts of items there. Some are

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-3
01:19:34.206 --> 01:19:37.877
still dressed up in their
costumes from the space setting,

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-4
01:19:37.877 --> 01:19:41.796
and there's some aliens there,
and there's a Dracula there. So

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-5
01:19:41.796 --> 01:19:45.342
they have come from all
different areas to get something

337dd2fc-0204-45df-9a6f-98a41e0e58c7-6
01:19:45.342 --> 01:19:47.520
to eat. The Cavemen are there
too.

ca0e53f5-4874-455a-95d2-d7e69a81b319-0
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.163
Oh, let's see. What else? I

ca0e53f5-4874-455a-95d2-d7e69a81b319-1
01:19:51.163 --> 01:19:53.719
think that's it for me. #END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls I think
that's it. There's a lot of

ca0e53f5-4874-455a-95d2-d7e69a81b319-2
01:19:53.719 --> 01:19:56.530
stuff going on in these. Where's
Waldo? I can't believe somebody

ca0e53f5-4874-455a-95d2-d7e69a81b319-3
01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:57.510
has drawn all of this.

c667f2fd-d642-44c9-a3ee-e668899079ee-0
01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:01.500
Wonder how long it took for
that?

0fd02072-7846-4f37-b997-9505eb0bf460-0
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:06.280
Alright, so then the next one.

d90fcaad-7442-4368-80ff-2712afd63a08-0
01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:13.710
#START_make_a_splash OK, we have
another scene of.

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-0
01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:19.165
Another water scene here and it
looks like a lot of people are

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-1
01:20:19.165 --> 01:20:23.947
enjoying being in the water. We
have people going on a number of

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-2
01:20:23.947 --> 01:20:28.288
slides, all kinds of slides
here, flying around in circles

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-3
01:20:28.288 --> 01:20:32.555
around slides, waiting in line
to get on the slides. Some

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-4
01:20:32.555 --> 01:20:36.822
people are on inner tubes
floating along in the water. We

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-5
01:20:36.822 --> 01:20:41.163
have a lot of people just
swimming and enjoying their time

a7896da5-661e-4ffd-b336-30a193cf3ed4-6
01:20:41.163 --> 01:20:44.180
in the water with their friends
we have.

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-0
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:48.813
Uh, somebody that has a big
water gun and he is spraying

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-1
01:20:48.813 --> 01:20:53.625
somebody with a water gun. We
have some people that are laying

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-2
01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:58.361
out just to get a tan and we
have a giant an elephant that is

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-3
01:20:58.361 --> 01:21:02.943
spraying water into this area.
And because it has sort of a

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-4
01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:07.832
path that people can take their
inner tubes along this path and

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-5
01:21:07.832 --> 01:21:12.720
enjoy, just enjoy floating along
in the water. We have it looks

e3019d17-466c-4ec8-9642-7e9f5f621926-6
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.630
like we have a lifeguard.

7442ea1b-6f7e-4aef-b0d3-53966c32df71-0
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:21.198
and we have, let's see because
somebody that is snorkeling and

7442ea1b-6f7e-4aef-b0d3-53966c32df71-1
01:21:21.198 --> 01:21:26.930
we have one that looks like 1
sea creature that people can.

566818af-d8fb-426f-b45e-9ace4795651e-0
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.350
Ride along on people seem to be
enjoying that we have.

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-0
01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:39.567
what looks like a dragon that
can shoot water out of its mouth

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-1
01:21:39.567 --> 01:21:43.728
that people can ride on, and we
have a boat in the background

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-2
01:21:43.728 --> 01:21:47.889
that people can ride on and not
seeing anything else. I think

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-3
01:21:47.889 --> 01:21:51.916
that's really about it. People
just enjoying themselves and

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-4
01:21:51.916 --> 01:21:56.009
spraying water on each other and
there's a Penguin there and

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-5
01:21:56.009 --> 01:21:59.835
let's see, just doing all sorts
of swimming and enjoying

1ce1c576-343f-4360-883c-064ec8dec53e-6
01:21:59.835 --> 01:22:01.579
throwing balls in the air.

e5dad369-e041-41d5-90bd-6deb7f46686f-0
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:05.643
 They're just
enjoying being in the water in

e5dad369-e041-41d5-90bd-6deb7f46686f-1
01:22:05.643 --> 01:22:08.897
this in this scene and some are
toweling off, drawing off when

e5dad369-e041-41d5-90bd-6deb7f46686f-2
01:22:08.897 --> 01:22:10.240
they get out of the water.

ec0e12e7-02d6-4b8a-bb0b-0949ca3bff8e-0
01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.550
I think that's it for this one,
OK. #END_make_a_splash

ead210b8-3e47-49f7-839c-dcd3bc83bdb5-0
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:20.440
And go on to the next one. It
is a couple pages. Um.

1ad5f287-4a43-43c8-984e-467536dabfa7-0
01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:25.820
Just tell me what you see and
what is happening in the story.

3cf31eae-7ab5-4d90-9216-3e893f8ce023-0
01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:30.350
#START_arrival_3 OK, we start
with.

81c56da2-b42d-443d-9833-13ee157a7b36-0
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:36.081
A young boy that looks like he
is holding a newspaper under his

81c56da2-b42d-443d-9833-13ee157a7b36-1
01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:40.738
arm and it's possible if he's
selling newspapers, although

81c56da2-b42d-443d-9833-13ee157a7b36-2
01:22:40.738 --> 01:22:45.789
that's not clear to me. Next to
him we have two women holding a

81c56da2-b42d-443d-9833-13ee157a7b36-3
01:22:45.789 --> 01:22:47.210
cat like creature.

6bd0795d-5774-4578-9db5-68cf7921afab-0
01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:50.120
And there was a man with.

4038e76b-853a-45b9-8a8a-462653dbf340-0
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:53.540
Part of some sort.

6fa87fea-c559-42bb-a50d-7d699e6e6766-0
01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.942
Looks like he has a creature on
a basket with him and he has

6fa87fea-c559-42bb-a50d-7d699e6e6766-1
01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:01.160
like a teapot.

5324b275-01f7-4f52-b99e-53e9cd56f2ee-0
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.776
And we have a man and a woman
that are holding what looks like

5324b275-01f7-4f52-b99e-53e9cd56f2ee-1
01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:13.793
giant eggs. We have a Barber who
is shaving a man and it looks

5324b275-01f7-4f52-b99e-53e9cd56f2ee-2
01:23:13.793 --> 01:23:18.810
like his son, possibly in his
standing behind him waiting. And

5324b275-01f7-4f52-b99e-53e9cd56f2ee-3
01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:23.747
he had some creatures that look
like giant snails and smaller

5324b275-01f7-4f52-b99e-53e9cd56f2ee-4
01:23:23.747 --> 01:23:28.844
snails. Have a musician who is
playing an instrument that looks

5324b275-01f7-4f52-b99e-53e9cd56f2ee-5
01:23:28.844 --> 01:23:29.799
like it has.

adf997b5-1100-452b-a44d-91f447c0ed38-0
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.740
It's part accordion and part
trumpet, and another in another

adf997b5-1100-452b-a44d-91f447c0ed38-1
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:36.440
musician.

82a015a4-ade0-49b3-abee-3c1ba6df5d03-0
01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:40.689
Playing a violin type instrument
and they are looking at their

82a015a4-ade0-49b3-abee-3c1ba6df5d03-1
01:23:40.689 --> 01:23:44.312
music on a stand and there are a
number of birds that are hanging

82a015a4-ade0-49b3-abee-3c1ba6df5d03-2
01:23:44.312 --> 01:23:46.069
around on the floor beside them.

762434eb-6233-483a-bb4f-13ec68f44e46-0
01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:52.031
There is a group of people
sitting down and they're looking

762434eb-6233-483a-bb4f-13ec68f44e46-1
01:23:52.031 --> 01:23:52.290
at.

f9c14ee5-57a3-40a4-9b6a-e1c1ef287afd-0
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:58.203
A book of some sort and one
woman is doing some handwork.

f9c14ee5-57a3-40a4-9b6a-e1c1ef287afd-1
01:23:58.203 --> 01:24:02.160
While, another young person is
holding on to a pet.

b521e1b9-6235-4f03-93c9-73f11a9c1f75-0
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:05.950
and two people were in the
background and there is some.

503e2486-466f-4272-b22b-705df86ac339-0
01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.492
There are some wording on the on
the wall, but it's not clear to

503e2486-466f-4272-b22b-705df86ac339-1
01:24:11.492 --> 01:24:14.570
me what it says, what language
it is, and we see a man.

7eef2b1f-1018-409d-b0c7-8883700e209d-0
01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:19.560
Looking like he is in a quandary
and he's holding a suitcase.

3d50bc96-bef0-4b49-a064-f771643de3a4-0
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:26.840
he is looking at his watch.

9804e548-2a9a-4791-8666-eb9fac580510-0
01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:34.851
Pocket watch and he is looking
worried as he looks up into what

9804e548-2a9a-4791-8666-eb9fac580510-1
01:24:34.851 --> 01:24:38.380
looks like might be a clock up
on the.

a603e7f2-c34a-425e-a1b1-9ff6192163ef-0
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:44.858
he is walking along with his
suitcase, walking along, walking

a603e7f2-c34a-425e-a1b1-9ff6192163ef-1
01:24:44.858 --> 01:24:48.690
along, and he is looking up into
the air where there is.

485cd717-6456-4197-8c8a-2832302e49b4-0
01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:54.074
All around them, some sparkling
items like stars all around

485cd717-6456-4197-8c8a-2832302e49b4-1
01:24:54.074 --> 01:24:58.367
them. It's not clear if this is
snow or what. This is hail

485cd717-6456-4197-8c8a-2832302e49b4-2
01:24:58.367 --> 01:24:59.240
coming down.

f4663edd-2003-4eb5-b578-fbb937e80b44-0
01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:05.743
he drops his hat. His hat gets
blown off by the wind, and he

f4663edd-2003-4eb5-b578-fbb937e80b44-1
01:25:05.743 --> 01:25:09.650
picks it up off the ground and
puts it back on.

273643ce-84bc-4f8c-9c0a-b6dfb9e77079-0
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.860
And he was looking at what looks
like a map.

ecd44ca6-ec35-441e-8b67-af6299e00494-0
01:25:13.690 --> 01:25:14.980
That's on the ground.

e901d4f5-30d6-470d-b79c-7cbedc4941e5-0
01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.954
He opens the book and he's
looking at this book and someone

e901d4f5-30d6-470d-b79c-7cbedc4941e5-1
01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:24.040
comes up to him and is talking
with him.

6fd29e72-eea8-478f-80f1-8eb6e14e9b0c-0
01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.800
And he writes something down and
he shows this.

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-0
01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.483
what he is drawn to the man that
has come to talk with him, and

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-1
01:25:34.483 --> 01:25:38.306
it's a bed. He has drawn a bed.
It looks like he's looking for a

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-2
01:25:38.306 --> 01:25:41.893
place to stay that has a bed.
And the man that comes to talk

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-3
01:25:41.893 --> 01:25:45.539
to him says, oh, I know where
there, where you can find that.

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-4
01:25:45.539 --> 01:25:49.185
So he is taking him along. And
this man has a little creature

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-5
01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:52.596
on his back in a basket and
they're walking along and our

df270b6c-6177-4fbe-9d40-f5a567f1033a-6
01:25:52.596 --> 01:25:53.889
man was following him.

686ac8bd-a06b-44cf-8083-00df98a4dfdc-0
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.490
Hopefully to find a bed to sleep in. #END_arrival_3 

1559f70d-c2e6-4eb1-85d9-6bfea951b91b-0
01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:03.112
OK, good. Then we can move on
to the next one for this complex

1559f70d-c2e6-4eb1-85d9-6bfea951b91b-1
01:26:03.112 --> 01:26:03.760
scene.

6e39043a-51b4-4522-bc0b-48ce37730c9b-0
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.192
#START_exhibit_12 Oh my
goodness. This is a great

6e39043a-51b4-4522-bc0b-48ce37730c9b-1
01:26:08.192 --> 01:26:12.088
portrait exhibition and there
are people all over the place.

6e39043a-51b4-4522-bc0b-48ce37730c9b-2
01:26:12.088 --> 01:26:16.175
It is crazy. Oh, it looks like
it's a museum that has portraits

6e39043a-51b4-4522-bc0b-48ce37730c9b-3
01:26:16.175 --> 01:26:19.815
and there are portraits all over
the walls, all sorts of

6e39043a-51b4-4522-bc0b-48ce37730c9b-4
01:26:19.815 --> 01:26:23.710
portraits. And some people are
actually holding portraits as

6e39043a-51b4-4522-bc0b-48ce37730c9b-5
01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:25.690
they go up and down the stairs.

d11c3b9b-ee1d-4cc3-9b0b-589df97f1c34-0
01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.570
It looks like a giant museum
that has.

15be30eb-40e6-4a2f-812b-197d502b1880-0
01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:35.838
Portraits all over the place and
people are hanging portraits,

15be30eb-40e6-4a2f-812b-197d502b1880-1
01:26:35.838 --> 01:26:36.800
people are.

70b29093-03e3-40c5-9726-4e5d735c6c5a-0
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:39.040
Painting portraits.

caa98b26-82a6-4b76-bf93-78881b6427d4-0
01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:41.900
People are drawing things on the
ground.

a685b793-2bac-42af-a83e-1f297f58af96-0
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:46.620
People are selling things.
People are making portraits.

e3e14d8d-be35-4e31-a57b-17623f08d050-0
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.344
There are artists all over the
place. Some are making things,

e3e14d8d-be35-4e31-a57b-17623f08d050-1
01:26:52.344 --> 01:26:54.250
some are having portraits.

c4ce6a2b-6a6c-4533-9524-88d552591dff-0
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.970
Put over their head.

47637978-1a7e-4900-80a7-80d642a74479-0
01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:02.440
And for some reason people are
running. People are.

f591dece-40ae-4379-ab79-964c98cf8a6b-0
01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:03.870
Just.

c9a39ad0-6285-4212-800e-89df3032ec76-0
01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:07.430
Hanging portraits all over the
place.

16cfb332-0eb5-40ce-85f9-3228ceb97939-0
01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.064
It's not clear what exactly is
going on here. It's kind of

16cfb332-0eb5-40ce-85f9-3228ceb97939-1
01:27:12.064 --> 01:27:16.105
crazy. I've never seen so many
people in one place looking at

16cfb332-0eb5-40ce-85f9-3228ceb97939-2
01:27:16.105 --> 01:27:20.211
portraits. Of course there are
portraits hanging on the walls,

16cfb332-0eb5-40ce-85f9-3228ceb97939-3
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:24.316
and there are portraits being
carried around everywhere. There

16cfb332-0eb5-40ce-85f9-3228ceb97939-4
01:27:24.316 --> 01:27:27.510
are portraits being made, their
portraits being.

36079bd4-e7b2-4bdf-98b0-8344ec6902dd-0
01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:33.340
Damaged there are portraits.

903dc84d-6284-4752-93d4-65ab76a78a8c-0
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.752
It's like they
have let too many people in this

903dc84d-6284-4752-93d4-65ab76a78a8c-1
01:27:38.752 --> 01:27:42.957
into this museum and there is.
It's just complete chaos. I see

903dc84d-6284-4752-93d4-65ab76a78a8c-2
01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:46.895
people sitting for portraits,
people running for away from

903dc84d-6284-4752-93d4-65ab76a78a8c-3
01:27:46.895 --> 01:27:47.430
artists.

8e88491a-6e4f-4f1c-896a-6b5b98c1070d-0
01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:53.599
Ohh my gosh. I think that's all
I had to say about this. #END_exhibit_12 It's

8e88491a-6e4f-4f1c-896a-6b5b98c1070d-1
01:27:53.599 --> 01:27:57.548
just too crazy. This one's too
crazy for me. I'm sorry. That's

8e88491a-6e4f-4f1c-896a-6b5b98c1070d-2
01:27:57.548 --> 01:27:58.740
fine. Ohh my gosh.

7e50965f-790f-4356-8d43-8b19db24eb48-0
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.590
Let's try this one, OK?

c7b6752f-72ca-4392-9418-804693eddc0b-0
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.781
#START_being_a_pirate So this is
a scene on the ocean and it

c7b6752f-72ca-4392-9418-804693eddc0b-1
01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:13.219
looks like there are a number of
pirate ships all over the place.

c7b6752f-72ca-4392-9418-804693eddc0b-2
01:28:13.219 --> 01:28:17.455
There is one giant pirate ship
that has a number of sails that

c7b6752f-72ca-4392-9418-804693eddc0b-3
01:28:17.455 --> 01:28:21.691
are not curled right now, and
there's a smaller ship, and then

c7b6752f-72ca-4392-9418-804693eddc0b-4
01:28:21.691 --> 01:28:25.658
then there's a number of row
boats all over the place with

c7b6752f-72ca-4392-9418-804693eddc0b-5
01:28:25.658 --> 01:28:27.070
people all over them.

04c1916b-c205-4f60-b44a-a354ddc7a5b3-0
01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.640
There is also an island and
there are people on the island.

ec8a4920-6654-495a-85a6-eaf869e0248f-0
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:38.464
And on each boat, people are
doing different things. In some

ec8a4920-6654-495a-85a6-eaf869e0248f-1
01:28:38.464 --> 01:28:44.063
cases people are rowing. In some
cases people are jumping off. In

ec8a4920-6654-495a-85a6-eaf869e0248f-2
01:28:44.063 --> 01:28:49.492
some cases the boat is actually
capsizing and they're trying to

ec8a4920-6654-495a-85a6-eaf869e0248f-3
01:28:49.492 --> 01:28:54.497
swim away from the boat. The
large boat has people hanging

ec8a4920-6654-495a-85a6-eaf869e0248f-4
01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:55.940
off of ropes and.

0591df25-b41b-4057-a221-e55e35573261-0
01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.561
actually shooting cannons and
there are also birds flying in

0591df25-b41b-4057-a221-e55e35573261-1
01:29:03.561 --> 01:29:04.750
the air and.

c3d7f02f-e954-4d39-9304-e8aa02fda033-0
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:07.310
Let's see, there are.

ff8d5c22-ecc9-4728-8632-b760142187fc-0
01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:14.950
people walking, uh, people all
together on.

05c1994a-02ee-48f7-8a5f-da281cb4320f-0
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:20.252
Just all squeezed onto this boat
and they're fighting with

05c1994a-02ee-48f7-8a5f-da281cb4320f-1
01:29:20.252 --> 01:29:20.720
swords.

0093f083-34cb-43d6-9b8e-b22023c2f547-0
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:27.910
I see cannons. They're trying to
blow things up on this ship. I

0093f083-34cb-43d6-9b8e-b22023c2f547-1
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:31.686
also see some cannons just
throwing whatever they're

0093f083-34cb-43d6-9b8e-b22023c2f547-2
01:29:31.686 --> 01:29:35.818
shooting is going straight into
the water and not hitting

0093f083-34cb-43d6-9b8e-b22023c2f547-3
01:29:35.818 --> 01:29:36.460
anything.

cf4979d7-6505-4706-a0ad-87686b1f4765-0
01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.770
 there are a lot of.

db7fd4bc-01b6-4ffe-89c0-60c500ea96b0-0
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:48.029
People far in the background,
one is 1 one but has someone

db7fd4bc-01b6-4ffe-89c0-60c500ea96b0-1
01:29:48.029 --> 01:29:49.430
walking the plank.

bebd71c3-276a-4cfe-9063-9c635411160c-0
01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:53.290
And there are a number of fish
that are down in the ocean

bebd71c3-276a-4cfe-9063-9c635411160c-1
01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:56.530
waiting for that person to go
off the plane so that they can

bebd71c3-276a-4cfe-9063-9c635411160c-2
01:29:56.530 --> 01:29:59.823
eat them. Looks like they're
sharks, and they're all ready to

bebd71c3-276a-4cfe-9063-9c635411160c-3
01:29:59.823 --> 01:30:02.957
go out there. There's a giant
octopus that is playing with

bebd71c3-276a-4cfe-9063-9c635411160c-4
01:30:02.957 --> 01:30:04.020
people in the water.

d6d96c81-dedd-4d96-a1de-a8b6581185a7-0
01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:10.640
Yeah, it looks like there are
some men.

52273b41-6053-4ecc-bd0c-02bbfec8c928-0
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.021
One is taking a bath. It looks
like he's in a bathtub floating

52273b41-6053-4ecc-bd0c-02bbfec8c928-1
01:30:16.021 --> 01:30:17.270
along on the water.

f2a774dc-85e0-4d23-9b3d-9b0f7714d2e4-0
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:21.410
The people
on the island are looking at

f2a774dc-85e0-4d23-9b3d-9b0f7714d2e4-1
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:25.085
treasure that they have found,
that they've dug up some buried

f2a774dc-85e0-4d23-9b3d-9b0f7714d2e4-2
01:30:25.085 --> 01:30:25.610
treasure. #END_being_a_pirate 

5a221615-917a-4c58-8bd3-5da725f475b2-0
01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.340
OK. I think that's it for me
for this. OK. Thank you.

0834223a-98bc-4e7b-9ed2-765c0ecccf57-0
01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:35.070
This will be the last one we do
the day.

b3b7c142-3761-4b69-8984-363518d91bd0-0
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:40.424
#START_birthday_party_fun Ohh,
this one is birthday party fun.

b3b7c142-3761-4b69-8984-363518d91bd0-1
01:30:40.424 --> 01:30:44.458
Let's see, we've got all kinds
of things related to a birthday

b3b7c142-3761-4b69-8984-363518d91bd0-2
01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:48.364
party here. We have some people
playing in a little pool and

b3b7c142-3761-4b69-8984-363518d91bd0-3
01:30:48.364 --> 01:30:52.271
throwing water on each other and
using squirt guns to squirt

b3b7c142-3761-4b69-8984-363518d91bd0-4
01:30:52.271 --> 01:30:55.537
people. We have balloons,
presents. We have people

b3b7c142-3761-4b69-8984-363518d91bd0-5
01:30:55.537 --> 01:30:57.009
bringing more presents.

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-0
01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:01.840
We have people playing tug of
war and they're dressed up in

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-1
01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:06.418
outfits. It looks like they have
come in costume. They're dressed

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-2
01:31:06.418 --> 01:31:10.579
up as pirates and Batman and
Indians and Vikings. We have a

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-3
01:31:10.579 --> 01:31:14.809
table full of sweets and it
looks like there are cookies and

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-4
01:31:14.809 --> 01:31:19.039
candy and cupcakes and a cake
and also some things like that

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-5
01:31:19.039 --> 01:31:22.853
are probably better for us to
eat, like sandwiches and

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-6
01:31:22.853 --> 01:31:26.876
lettuce. And it looks like
they're they have a pinata, so

7f452f8a-f833-44dc-806d-3e3be0a87dae-7
01:31:26.876 --> 01:31:28.609
they're getting ready to.

a372d8ad-0505-4983-9654-eae484a58ff0-0
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:33.230
Play with the pinata. We have
some lanterns hanging in the

a372d8ad-0505-4983-9654-eae484a58ff0-1
01:31:33.230 --> 01:31:37.483
tree also, and we have a look.
Looks like a grandmother looking

a372d8ad-0505-4983-9654-eae484a58ff0-2
01:31:37.483 --> 01:31:41.338
over the fence to see what's
