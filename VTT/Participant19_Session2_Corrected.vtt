00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.886
{OK, so we'll continue on for a
study. The this item is a

073a5415-deb5-4e7f-bcf1-f7d836d8a451-1
00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:11.247
complex scene, so please
describe what you see and what

073a5415-deb5-4e7f-bcf1-f7d836d8a451-2
00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:16.154
is happening in detail and aim
to describe it in between three

073a5415-deb5-4e7f-bcf1-f7d836d8a451-3
00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:20.826
and five minutes and I'll let
you know when it's time, when

073a5415-deb5-4e7f-bcf1-f7d836d8a451-4
00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:22.540
it's about 5 minutes.}

f5cc262d-6a2c-4033-9cf4-fa8f1b5e5e5c-0
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.598
#START_airport Hi, it's me
again, Waldo. Folks, some very

f5cc262d-6a2c-4033-9cf4-fa8f1b5e5e5c-1
00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:36.522
strange things happened at the
airport this morning and

f5cc262d-6a2c-4033-9cf4-fa8f1b5e5e5c-2
00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:39.916
helicopter chopped down all the
flagpoles, a smuggler was caught

f5cc262d-6a2c-4033-9cf4-fa8f1b5e5e5c-3
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:43.101
hiding watches under this beard,
and a herd of elephants was

f5cc262d-6a2c-4033-9cf4-fa8f1b5e5e5c-4
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:45.659
getting onto a jumbo plate.
That's pretty weird.

0f19dfb6-b02e-4dde-8f4a-691da956ba6b-0
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.261
So in the sky you see a flying
saucer, an airplane and a

0f19dfb6-b02e-4dde-8f4a-691da956ba6b-1
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:56.351
rocket. Somebody fired a rocket.
Looks like it's towards the

0f19dfb6-b02e-4dde-8f4a-691da956ba6b-2
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.290
airplane even.

5581a137-9d51-4d1e-8e9f-bf72bc8b342c-0
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.160
People up on top of the tower
there.

4bc9e11e-bc6c-4f50-9d6a-0ba8ecdf9410-0
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.765
And then on the other side is
another plane. It's just taking

4bc9e11e-bc6c-4f50-9d6a-0ba8ecdf9410-1
00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:05.970
off.

758b4d1a-8ece-40ea-9a24-d11633df7861-0
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.816
Then you have a small biplane.
That's the ones with the four

758b4d1a-8ece-40ea-9a24-d11633df7861-1
00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:14.370
wings that they used to use in
the old days oh there's a blimp.

11fa2a61-56da-4030-811f-f0099ff6ddab-0
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.706
Those things are giant
ginormous. There's another

11fa2a61-56da-4030-811f-f0099ff6ddab-1
00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:23.042
rocket taking off, and there's
half plane, half eagle. That's

11fa2a61-56da-4030-811f-f0099ff6ddab-2
00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:27.517
very interesting. Maybe it's an
eagle plane. Then there's a hot

11fa2a61-56da-4030-811f-f0099ff6ddab-3
00:01:27.517 --> 00:01:31.503
air balloon down below the
they're getting ready to take

11fa2a61-56da-4030-811f-f0099ff6ddab-4
00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:35.490
off, it looks like, and next to
it there's a helicopter.

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-0
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.908
Several different country flags
as a British flag in American

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-1
00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:44.787
flag, like might be an Italian
flag and I'm not sure what the

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-2
00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:48.540
other one is. Then there's a
little policeman with a rescue

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-3
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.294
vehicle and there's a plane. It
must be a jumbo plane cause

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-4
00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:56.047
they're loading elephants. I
know that many elephants could

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-5
00:01:56.047 --> 00:01:59.863
fit on a plane. We have special
one and above that's a giant

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-6
00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:03.429
shoe though and a wind socks
finding which way the winds

f320b78d-1af4-4567-851c-9357e41c5272-7
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.930
blowing.

d469c839-d52c-4db6-855a-5bd5245480ab-0
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.850
you need that in an airport

b55e4884-9a5e-47e6-a1d1-d0681ebc5b7e-0
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.972
When you come down below and
there's a couple of other power

b55e4884-9a5e-47e6-a1d1-d0681ebc5b7e-1
00:02:10.972 --> 00:02:14.940
planes, 1 1 is the people are
coming out from the airport into

b55e4884-9a5e-47e6-a1d1-d0681ebc5b7e-2
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.830
the to loading onto the plane.

0d238e36-6068-4eec-8d05-600391c68265-0
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.608
And then ohh there is a bus
taking people probably off the

0d238e36-6068-4eec-8d05-600391c68265-1
00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:26.902
plane, taking them out out away
from the plane, taking them back

0d238e36-6068-4eec-8d05-600391c68265-2
00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:27.960
to the terminal.

4304550f-837f-44cb-bedf-816a8d5f9961-0
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.600
And then there's another vehicle
there. He's loading up another

4304550f-837f-44cb-bedf-816a8d5f9961-1
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.126
plane with gasoline or whatever
fuel they use airplane fuel

4304550f-837f-44cb-bedf-816a8d5f9961-2
00:02:36.126 --> 00:02:39.945
because you got to have airplane
fuel to take off and looks like

4304550f-837f-44cb-bedf-816a8d5f9961-3
00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.530
they're checking the whole plane
out to make sure it's safe.

c5e481aa-ffdb-4b1c-84ec-77671a4ab81a-0
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.790
There's people getting off that
plane, they're all boarding and

c5e481aa-ffdb-4b1c-84ec-77671a4ab81a-1
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.540
and walking into the airport.

75a44060-81c7-4f63-84e6-95ea9e18f1d3-0
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.289
Then there's a guy with a
tractor pulling some cows. Not

75a44060-81c7-4f63-84e6-95ea9e18f1d3-1
00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.860
sure where they're going.

6e46c3c7-cdfc-470b-9d2a-594982c05114-0
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.605
And we look over here and the
luggage guy, ohh, the luggage

6e46c3c7-cdfc-470b-9d2a-594982c05114-1
00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:06.254
guy has lost some of his luggage
that had fallen on top of one

6e46c3c7-cdfc-470b-9d2a-594982c05114-2
00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:06.659
person.

6d84a8f1-5d82-4fef-81e3-f1e321e11b2f-0
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.961
Oh, and then he ran over the gas
hose and disconnected it from

6d84a8f1-5d82-4fef-81e3-f1e321e11b2f-1
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:12.620
the airplane.

5f58d1e8-a1f0-4d02-a3ff-d97acf2851cf-0
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.600


507d2864-fbfd-4823-923b-831d5dad2c8d-0
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.765
And then, uh, and then there's
one these guys are throwing

507d2864-fbfd-4823-923b-831d5dad2c8d-1
00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:23.138
luggage from the there's a chute
that comes down to where all the

507d2864-fbfd-4823-923b-831d5dad2c8d-2
00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:26.256
luggage comes out, and these
guys are throwing their bags to

507d2864-fbfd-4823-923b-831d5dad2c8d-3
00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.578
each other, and one guy hits the
guy in the head, Ouch. And then

507d2864-fbfd-4823-923b-831d5dad2c8d-4
00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:32.696
they're loading it onto those
luggage trams and take it into

507d2864-fbfd-4823-923b-831d5dad2c8d-5
00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:33.310
the airport.

ea3847ca-3c17-4cc5-a769-09fcb9f69ee2-0
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.994
And then behind some boxes are
the guys taking breaks and

ea3847ca-3c17-4cc5-a769-09fcb9f69ee2-1
00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:41.735
they're all smoking, taking a
smoke break then sees them going

ea3847ca-3c17-4cc5-a769-09fcb9f69ee2-2
00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.119
or it might be their boss
saying, hey, what are you guys

ea3847ca-3c17-4cc5-a769-09fcb9f69ee2-3
00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.070
doing over here?

0545365e-143f-454e-a4b0-f382a438c293-0
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.882
And then other people are
walking to the some people are

0545365e-143f-454e-a4b0-f382a438c293-1
00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:52.515
falling out of the airplane. I
guess they forgot to put the

0545365e-143f-454e-a4b0-f382a438c293-2
00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:53.350
ramp down for them.

55ebd7e6-d72c-4206-a39d-8f1f221db4d9-0
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.760
Fire trucks running to escorting
people. Looks like a lot of

55ebd7e6-d72c-4206-a39d-8f1f221db4d9-1
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.120
chaos going on there.

520cec85-453e-4d9c-802c-a994057bc0c7-0
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.530
Right over there to where the
the luggage carousels are and

520cec85-453e-4d9c-802c-a994057bc0c7-1
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.517
luggage is coming out and it's
all open. It's all crushed. I

520cec85-453e-4d9c-802c-a994057bc0c7-2
00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:13.568
don't know what happened to all
that luggage, but it's in the

520cec85-453e-4d9c-802c-a994057bc0c7-3
00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:15.660
little boys on the luggage rack.

209c0f36-97eb-4813-b0ef-167656a5b126-0
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.408
And then they're walking up, and
then a man's showing them which

209c0f36-97eb-4813-b0ef-167656a5b126-1
00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:20.830
way to go.

88d2291c-b31f-4dfc-81db-a7b18b341526-0
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.451
And then there's a help. Oh, the
guys inspecting the luggage are

88d2291c-b31f-4dfc-81db-a7b18b341526-1
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:30.474
throwing everything out of her
luggage. What a mess. After you

88d2291c-b31f-4dfc-81db-a7b18b341526-2
00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:34.178
pack so neatly throwing it all
out. There's a guy selling

88d2291c-b31f-4dfc-81db-a7b18b341526-3
00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:37.500
watches, fake watches, and now
he's being arrested.

55b862a7-4e68-4a3e-953f-edcaf0e6e80c-0
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.002
Had chosen there's a guy looking
at this guy's beard and it's

55b862a7-4e68-4a3e-953f-edcaf0e6e80c-1
00:04:44.002 --> 00:04:44.690
very long.

752655ef-b1c8-497c-a249-368d6666599f-0
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.550
3 feet long.

64b77554-c389-421c-82a2-c895fd247e92-0
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.550
And then these other people.

630c7c55-7270-418f-8222-0e24c3c92ae8-0
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.304
Lot of attendants there. Another
lady dropped all of her luggage.

630c7c55-7270-418f-8222-0e24c3c92ae8-1
00:04:56.304 --> 00:04:59.426
Somebody's gonna have to help
her pick that up. Another guy

630c7c55-7270-418f-8222-0e24c3c92ae8-2
00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:02.548
hits the guy that's luggage
because he's staring at a woman

630c7c55-7270-418f-8222-0e24c3c92ae8-3
00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:04.369
and not watching where he's
going.

04093227-4014-4255-9f4a-d9aacb78bc45-0
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.119
Ohh yes, other counter must be
where the lost luggage goes or

04093227-4014-4255-9f4a-d9aacb78bc45-1
00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.609
where you're looking for your
luggage. That's no problem when

04093227-4014-4255-9f4a-d9aacb78bc45-2
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:14.580
you lose your luggage, not at
all.

42fdfe8d-fa95-478c-8e4b-0751525ceced-0
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.841
Then on top of that building or
little kids all and there's a

42fdfe8d-fa95-478c-8e4b-0751525ceced-1
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:23.632
looks like a pilot with little
airplane teaching the kids about

42fdfe8d-fa95-478c-8e4b-0751525ceced-2
00:05:23.632 --> 00:05:24.579
airplane flying.

ddf040a4-3a48-41d0-a9d4-ddf09350e5e3-0
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.942
#END_airport Very interesting.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.007
#START_wanderer This is very
interesting. Not sure what it

3cf1d758-68cc-46ad-b307-5ad8a4e2db61-1
00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:03.740
is, but it looks like a giant.

424eb7f9-3676-4540-9ec2-3cee3a78cf3a-0
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.076
Paper and there's a boy, and
then there's a man with a helmet

424eb7f9-3676-4540-9ec2-3cee3a78cf3a-1
00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:11.340
and two horns.

d60adf4f-9ea0-45ee-ac62-8f309d110c4c-0
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.590
And then they're starting to
roll the paper up.

e1ad2206-bfe1-4bdf-b1fd-59ae55b5a6f1-0
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.490
And then they're gone. And then
they're starting to fold the

e1ad2206-bfe1-4bdf-b1fd-59ae55b5a6f1-1
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.266
paper up. They're taking all
four corners and folding them

e1ad2206-bfe1-4bdf-b1fd-59ae55b5a6f1-2
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:23.690
together.

543a2d2e-abfc-4bc5-a57b-ddffe94888ef-0
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.000
And then it almost looks like a
giant hat.

030783f3-4781-4eec-8ec9-ce8134199f90-0
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.877
And then they're carrying this
hat over somewhere else and it

030783f3-4781-4eec-8ec9-ce8134199f90-1
00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:38.037
looks like a giant ship here.
Oh, it's a boat they made. And

030783f3-4781-4eec-8ec9-ce8134199f90-2
00:06:38.037 --> 00:06:41.720
they're sailing out to this boat
that's in the ocean.

b8281a97-ddbc-4b69-a855-85eafc1a5a67-0
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.531
I don't know that I know that
thing. I guess it can float it.

b8281a97-ddbc-4b69-a855-85eafc1a5a67-1
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.828
I wouldn't think it could. And
then the boat floating out to

b8281a97-ddbc-4b69-a855-85eafc1a5a67-2
00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:52.910
the out to sea and all the
seagulls are flying overhead.

ba9a6026-867c-41b1-ac52-f4b90f0c2c36-0
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.516
And the turtles are coming up to
say, what is this? What kind of

ba9a6026-867c-41b1-ac52-f4b90f0c2c36-1
00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:04.038
boat is this? And the birds are
looking at it. And oh, oh, here

ba9a6026-867c-41b1-ac52-f4b90f0c2c36-2
00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:07.559
comes the big whale next to the
boat. That boat, well, he might

ba9a6026-867c-41b1-ac52-f4b90f0c2c36-3
00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:08.550
swallow that boat.

5c8461ba-4eb6-4a20-a268-5802202d42ed-0
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.060
Always got the boat on his fin.
That's funny.

a11f2853-ed65-4489-bdb7-3f2ac95ccf90-0
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.164
There's a little teeny paper
boat or cloth boat, honest and

a11f2853-ed65-4489-bdb7-3f2ac95ccf90-1
00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:24.840
honest pen, and he's going away
with it.

3cf2eeb2-7332-485c-9c1f-51e0107761aa-0
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.525
Now the boat is on top of it
looks like a school of fish.

3cf2eeb2-7332-485c-9c1f-51e0107761aa-1
00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:34.680
There's a lot of fish down
there.

e4b25796-c4cb-4e18-a914-38ccf44a9ddb-0
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.018
It's like, yeah, big school of
fish in the boats floating along

e4b25796-c4cb-4e18-a914-38ccf44a9ddb-1
00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:39.650
the top of it.

f71ddb60-3f95-4383-86ca-9140725fbfff-0
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.280
Ah, there's.

96cc5865-d06b-4143-8f14-2bab0f79f03b-0
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.880
boats what looks like it's
raining down.

8b9bef29-e4b6-403a-888c-30ed0f602bd4-0
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.967
Yeah, there's two little fishes
down below kissing. I don't know

8b9bef29-e4b6-403a-888c-30ed0f602bd4-1
00:07:54.967 --> 00:07:58.377
what kind of fish those are.
There's other fish. And then,

8b9bef29-e4b6-403a-888c-30ed0f602bd4-2
00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:02.077
oh, somebody's fishing from the
boat. Looks like they've caught

8b9bef29-e4b6-403a-888c-30ed0f602bd4-3
00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:04.910
a fish on the hook. Oh, he's
going to be caught.

7a2b9e8b-deb6-4a05-9b38-f52bb8a9f5e0-0
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.153
Now there's a fish with a
little, almost like a seahorse

7a2b9e8b-deb6-4a05-9b38-f52bb8a9f5e0-1
00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:17.566
on his head, and he's got the
boat on top of his head, a

7a2b9e8b-deb6-4a05-9b38-f52bb8a9f5e0-2
00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:21.158
little one of the big boat.
There's a big boat and a little

7a2b9e8b-deb6-4a05-9b38-f52bb8a9f5e0-3
00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:24.751
teeny boat on top of his head,
and plenty of coral and fish

7a2b9e8b-deb6-4a05-9b38-f52bb8a9f5e0-4
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:25.589
under the sea.

6fa61917-089b-4d6e-9dc9-26e8a2eb0cf0-0
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.293
Then there's what looks like a
snake coming up to go into the

6fa61917-089b-4d6e-9dc9-26e8a2eb0cf0-1
00:08:30.293 --> 00:08:32.440
boat. Maybe it's an eel or
something.

b15b828e-33e9-4680-a4bc-097e858a00b6-0
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.670
Oh the seahorses is in the boat.

6521ef6b-c476-4db1-a9a8-168cf6c8b824-0
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.756
Now the boat looks like it's
sailing along to I don't know if

6521ef6b-c476-4db1-a9a8-168cf6c8b824-1
00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:51.270
it's an island or just a bunch
of trees with birds on it.

20b2f0a8-b2e0-4e47-991a-8ec3e5f953d6-0
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.450
Thousands of birds on it.

d4192ef1-8872-4cd7-81ac-b11f68378fab-0
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.710
The birds are looking at each
other.

c6d535f8-67ec-4c31-b5f9-a8819081e185-0
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.330
In the boat sailing through it,
I'm not sure what it is. Maybe

c6d535f8-67ec-4c31-b5f9-a8819081e185-1
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.675
it's like a coral reef or
something where they can fit

c6d535f8-67ec-4c31-b5f9-a8819081e185-2
00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:16.020
through all the different giant
plants that are there.

830b157f-c66c-4ae6-a067-92c5412e2aa6-0
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.803
Two birds are looking at each
other, talking to each other.

830b157f-c66c-4ae6-a067-92c5412e2aa6-1
00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:22.780
Little fish are fishing all
around, swimming all around.

fe35e4d8-4313-4758-9d67-8510c3b460cf-0
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.430
You know where the boats headed.

853d954d-46da-40ca-b675-495fa7d06395-0
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.600
And this is interesting.

b8d7dd4d-2434-4492-adb7-c86b8c15b28a-0
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.077
Fish and they have glowing eyes
and little birds looking at

b8d7dd4d-2434-4492-adb7-c86b8c15b28a-1
00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.540
them. All the birds got glowing
eyes too.

62c6d68a-230f-4377-a869-8b8c114c5e1f-0
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.684
Oh, and then it looked like
almost like alligators with

62c6d68a-230f-4377-a869-8b8c114c5e1f-1
00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:47.060
glowing eyes in the little
seahorses sailing along.

a93f28b5-de7d-4b1d-9b5f-26d06b334b60-0
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.470
Now the seahorse is looking
down.

6e3dbd0f-8c41-407c-b9c9-781c6eea340d-0
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.220
Funny looking.

dd0ac34b-e00d-403d-be26-37520baaeb08-0
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.875
Creature walking on look like
looks like a lobster riding the

dd0ac34b-e00d-403d-be26-37520baaeb08-1
00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:04.960
lobster along.

84acd081-17d6-4f26-a20b-9ebce4e6e0ea-0
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.119
There's all, then there's a
bunch of other seahorses and

84acd081-17d6-4f26-a20b-9ebce4e6e0ea-1
00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:12.300
looks like they found another
boat to get into.

a7cfccfd-46d4-4cd8-9a1b-43ee54ebd098-0
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.961
Oh, and there's a giant whale.
And that little little boat

a7cfccfd-46d4-4cd8-9a1b-43ee54ebd098-1
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:25.543
looks so little next to this
giant whale. Now all the birds

a7cfccfd-46d4-4cd8-9a1b-43ee54ebd098-2
00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:29.363
are sitting on top of of of the
whale. Then some strange little

a7cfccfd-46d4-4cd8-9a1b-43ee54ebd098-3
00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:32.885
things coming out of his head.
Not sure what it is, but it

a7cfccfd-46d4-4cd8-9a1b-43ee54ebd098-4
00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:36.825
looks like it's pulling the boat
up. I'm not even sure if this is

a7cfccfd-46d4-4cd8-9a1b-43ee54ebd098-5
00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:39.870
a whale anymore. I don't know
what this animal is.

b5aa7a2c-06bf-49de-a108-37a13d1e68ff-0
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.710
And it's on top of a ship.

e290ca00-2fc1-484f-bf4b-a121ccf1660d-0
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.180
Very interesting looking. He's
got sharp teeth though.

8bfc2eb5-fef7-43b9-a69c-a0138b82b661-0
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:49.570


985d649a-61cb-48f8-877f-d6a56fff658a-0
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.368
There's more birds and more
strange looking creatures under

985d649a-61cb-48f8-877f-d6a56fff658a-1
00:10:57.368 --> 00:10:57.800
the sea.

a2466f2e-eaa9-407e-828d-c028a3572656-0
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.395
some Look like snakes. Some look
like alligators, some look like

a2466f2e-eaa9-407e-828d-c028a3572656-1
00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:07.474
even look like tigers, but they
have fins and some have look

a2466f2e-eaa9-407e-828d-c028a3572656-2
00:11:07.474 --> 00:11:11.887
like elephants, but they're able
to be under the water, the lions

a2466f2e-eaa9-407e-828d-c028a3572656-3
00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:15.230
and everywhere not under there.
Very interesting.

222d4993-d2ab-4967-b1e5-7318dcf79cd2-0
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.827
Now it's night time. So many
stars and the little boats out

222d4993-d2ab-4967-b1e5-7318dcf79cd2-1
00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:25.845
there all by itself, and all the
glowing eyes of the fish are

222d4993-d2ab-4967-b1e5-7318dcf79cd2-2
00:11:25.845 --> 00:11:29.150
under the sea and the stars in
the sky are lit up.

77bb5815-44e0-49e0-b384-e841e4559c63-0
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.143
It's so beautiful. And this
little Half Moon out there.

77bb5815-44e0-49e0-b384-e841e4559c63-1
00:11:33.143 --> 00:11:36.440
Sliver of a moon, not 1/2 Moon,
sliver of a moon showing.

48d06616-c4b0-4212-9a45-e1df3353c03f-0
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.294
Now all the fish are surrounded,
have surrounded the little boat,

48d06616-c4b0-4212-9a45-e1df3353c03f-1
00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:50.750
and they all have glowing eyes.
They're all watching them both.

f5918516-c871-40f7-9fbb-6bf96c9d53b3-0
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.510
another boat sailing to. Not
sure what that is.

445850ec-7393-49b4-befc-95dc8598d1db-0
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.934
Something shimmering hanging
from the sky looks like a

445850ec-7393-49b4-befc-95dc8598d1db-1
00:12:02.934 --> 00:12:04.150
shimmering ribbon.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.344
Maybe it's a Cliff in the middle
of the ocean, maybe an iceberg

f1799fc3-1d88-4b2d-a1d2-a71bb18026f2-1
00:12:13.344 --> 00:12:16.992
or something, but it's a real
high and the boats are real

f1799fc3-1d88-4b2d-a1d2-a71bb18026f2-2
00:12:16.992 --> 00:12:17.810
little below.

794430c0-07e9-4397-9e91-d46c654d0dd0-0
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.584
And you can, the boat can go
through this little iceberg

794430c0-07e9-4397-9e91-d46c654d0dd0-1
00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:30.440
thing and it's floating in like
a tunnel part of the iceberg.

e5cfd8e2-bdb9-4562-ab4c-fae46e181fb2-0
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.340
Or rock, whatever it is.

0185ac8b-9059-4276-8271-73b12b0438e7-0
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.972
Ah, and then he came out the
other side and he sees the thing

0185ac8b-9059-4276-8271-73b12b0438e7-1
00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:48.894
staring at the boat. The next
one, it looks like it, almost

0185ac8b-9059-4276-8271-73b12b0438e7-2
00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:52.946
like a sea diver, but it has
fins on it, so I'm not sure what

0185ac8b-9059-4276-8271-73b12b0438e7-3
00:12:52.946 --> 00:12:56.803
it is. He's #8 though, that's
what he is. And he's got the

0185ac8b-9059-4276-8271-73b12b0438e7-4
00:12:56.803 --> 00:13:00.267
boat in his hand and he's
looking at it and stuff is

0185ac8b-9059-4276-8271-73b12b0438e7-5
00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:03.470
pouring out of his little
goggles on his helmet.

36c759af-7a83-41e7-afdd-521ce342b0b5-0
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.910
And a light shining on the boat.

b957773c-fc57-4829-8897-02f42509fd2e-0
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.880
And now we're next to a giant
ship. Ohh, it's very big.

fefb7c51-1064-4022-8846-dcafccecbf13-0
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.311
And the little boats next to it
and that little thing that was

fefb7c51-1064-4022-8846-dcafccecbf13-1
00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:25.556
shining is up above there
looking at the giant ship, is

fefb7c51-1064-4022-8846-dcafccecbf13-2
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:28.860
that giant bags hanging off it's
fishing bags of fishes.

1a685df7-c5f9-464d-8002-523972953aa4-0
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.110
Hmm, that's filled with fish.

a862cc78-5dbd-46e8-9072-d421a006dabc-0
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.883
Now the boats were the floating
along with all the birds. Lots

a862cc78-5dbd-46e8-9072-d421a006dabc-1
00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:45.852
of birds. The birds are in the
ocean, the birds are birds are

a862cc78-5dbd-46e8-9072-d421a006dabc-2
00:13:45.852 --> 00:13:49.501
in the sky. And then they're
coming to a strange looking

a862cc78-5dbd-46e8-9072-d421a006dabc-3
00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:51.870
building in the middle of the
water.

fc456296-43e0-4fff-8b6a-a800ad806c12-0
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.416
And share it might be an oil
rig, might be a fishing thing.

fc456296-43e0-4fff-8b6a-a800ad806c12-1
00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:58.416
It's holding up a big wheel on
the side of it though that they

fc456296-43e0-4fff-8b6a-a800ad806c12-2
00:13:58.416 --> 00:13:58.750
caught.

d3b665d4-4a14-4f08-84aa-a7545f6e970f-0
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.250
Smokes coming out the top of it.

3e277eb3-3f7e-4d8b-9ee1-be872ae228cf-0
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.740
Ohh, now somebody's out shooting
at the boat.

855e8d96-5782-4497-b1dd-09f8df5c69a7-0
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.440
A bunch of men are shooting at
the boat.

ddb04dc2-562f-47d7-83e6-3e1f3e2801b1-0
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.625
And then there's a guy on a
trying to get away on a little

ddb04dc2-562f-47d7-83e6-3e1f3e2801b1-1
00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:21.161
ride see riding thing and
they're shooting at him too. And

ddb04dc2-562f-47d7-83e6-3e1f3e2801b1-2
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:22.900
then big anchors coming down.

0679b967-63b8-46a2-86ef-6be6bffcc787-0
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.822
And then there's a guy in the
funny helmet and he's he's on a

0679b967-63b8-46a2-86ef-6be6bffcc787-1
00:14:27.822 --> 00:14:30.390
rocket. Looks like he's ready to
take off.

872fbcf1-ff38-4391-8b44-51f48e311c8b-0
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.310
Ohh, now he's holding on to the
boat.

bcd2ec0f-72d6-44ee-908f-2f1d9d031de8-0
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:40.810
with a rope

174fffd9-f5cd-430e-8064-a95aad8a0cd3-0
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.550
Then there's other people.
There's all kinds of strange

174fffd9-f5cd-430e-8064-a95aad8a0cd3-1
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.216
little creatures in another boat
coming towards them. One guy has

174fffd9-f5cd-430e-8064-a95aad8a0cd3-2
00:14:49.216 --> 00:14:52.548
a mean look with a horn on his
head, and there's a cat, and

174fffd9-f5cd-430e-8064-a95aad8a0cd3-3
00:14:52.548 --> 00:14:55.770
there's and a horse and strange
looking little creatures.

e089342b-1bf6-4700-85d2-a9e74c41eccf-0
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.397
And then there's a big wave,
like a big tidal wave coming the

e089342b-1bf6-4700-85d2-a9e74c41eccf-1
00:15:05.397 --> 00:15:07.770
little boats on its side under
the wave.

ef9e59d0-8912-4205-902f-0e8f11b02619-0
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.952
And the strange looking boat
with the strange looking people

ef9e59d0-8912-4205-902f-0e8f11b02619-1
00:15:12.952 --> 00:15:16.539
are riding right into the tidal
wave. It looks like a a curved

ef9e59d0-8912-4205-902f-0e8f11b02619-2
00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:19.784
wave that you can ride on
through and the path walk on a

ef9e59d0-8912-4205-902f-0e8f11b02619-3
00:15:19.784 --> 00:15:23.484
tightrope through all of this. I
don't know how he's keeping his

ef9e59d0-8912-4205-902f-0e8f11b02619-4
00:15:23.484 --> 00:15:23.940
balance.

a582e454-61c3-4614-8ae1-3942f3b7c5b3-0
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.587
Ohh and then there's a big
lightning bolt coming down from

a582e454-61c3-4614-8ae1-3942f3b7c5b3-1
00:15:34.587 --> 00:15:35.070
the sky.

ce1474e4-1eb8-48b0-944c-ad6762510fff-0
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.764
And then the next one that the
boat is turned into, it looks

ce1474e4-1eb8-48b0-944c-ad6762510fff-1
00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:41.840
like an airplane he's flying
over the ocean.

bbdc4e2a-5c43-4417-8403-a9038582a47e-0
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.199
Now the boats going through ohh
you got to see this picture.

bbdc4e2a-5c43-4417-8403-a9038582a47e-1
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.840
Looks like a bunch of Donuts.

03e2d7be-70c5-4e35-b2ac-6fa4576b7a3b-0
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.555
Makes you hungry, but the boats
able to float right on through

03e2d7be-70c5-4e35-b2ac-6fa4576b7a3b-1
00:15:57.555 --> 00:15:59.570
it, riding through the donut
holes.

2d926c77-42f9-44a0-a5db-d21531c8c6bc-0
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.976
Ohh, but inside those donut
holes are dinosaur looking

2d926c77-42f9-44a0-a5db-d21531c8c6bc-1
00:16:11.976 --> 00:16:16.161
things are very scary with the
glowing eyes. Again, they're

2d926c77-42f9-44a0-a5db-d21531c8c6bc-2
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:19.510
just staring at the little boat
coming through.

2d1397d3-365f-4b8d-bc6a-768f04ac6415-0
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.329
Now these guys are outside of
the little Donuts, but their

2d1397d3-365f-4b8d-bc6a-768f04ac6415-1
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:33.273
eyes are still glowing. One has
a squirrely little horn, and one

2d1397d3-365f-4b8d-bc6a-768f04ac6415-2
00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:33.820
it's got.

09d4ec01-8a26-4527-9e05-d935f3727cad-0
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.352
Water or something coming out of
his his little nostrils into the

09d4ec01-8a26-4527-9e05-d935f3727cad-1
00:16:39.352 --> 00:16:39.720
boat.

e0b0a486-5a0a-4e03-ac15-b43c9b78a45b-0
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.052
And then there's another one
standing on the island. He looks

e0b0a486-5a0a-4e03-ac15-b43c9b78a45b-1
00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:47.635
like a fish on top, but then
he's got a little bikini bathing

e0b0a486-5a0a-4e03-ac15-b43c9b78a45b-2
00:16:47.635 --> 00:16:51.160
suit and he's got web feet on
the bottom looking sea urchin.

64a7b2f0-9fba-4e04-a8f1-4a2051281b36-0
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.420
propellers and bottles are
laying.

83e3c732-f427-461c-8c2e-1257875adf5d-0
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.286
This looks like a bunch of
jellyfish, like a boat has. The

83e3c732-f427-461c-8c2e-1257875adf5d-1
00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:10.234
boat has gone into a whole bunch
of jellyfish everywhere,

83e3c732-f427-461c-8c2e-1257875adf5d-2
00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:14.115
millions of them all over the
place and the boats in the

83e3c732-f427-461c-8c2e-1257875adf5d-3
00:17:14.115 --> 00:17:15.000
middle of it.

37422808-213c-4a1c-bf8e-94e492b29ce5-0
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.750
Now the boats with the School of
Fish again.

8db2adae-e52d-40e4-91a6-09d39a4c945d-0
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.860
Another couple of strange sea
urchin looking animals in there.

e4d0f246-5e51-4900-8f77-5bed1e786727-0
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.580
And another boats by another
strange animal and there's.

fa20dcc2-a1c0-44e2-a429-00322989fb91-0
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.025
 And then there's a shining
light shining down on these

fa20dcc2-a1c0-44e2-a429-00322989fb91-1
00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:41.268
other strains of those sea
urchins, and they're all over

fa20dcc2-a1c0-44e2-a429-00322989fb91-2
00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:41.780
the boat.

de963a52-1774-4bdf-a9ee-695f506009d2-0
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.537
Ones upside down it, ones on top
of it, ones crawling into it

de963a52-1774-4bdf-a9ee-695f506009d2-1
00:17:47.537 --> 00:17:47.940
then.

c59e02d0-c641-4e2d-8c11-362a89209d20-0
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.921
sea urchin underneath it and
then there's a a boat looks like

c59e02d0-c641-4e2d-8c11-362a89209d20-1
00:17:53.921 --> 00:17:57.480
it's dive bomb diving into the
sea urchin.

3547f236-3d1f-490c-99ff-2235ce237eb5-0
00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.026
Ohh, it's actually going
upwards. It must have been a

3547f236-3d1f-490c-99ff-2235ce237eb5-1
00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:11.983
submarine and it's going up
above the water now and the

3547f236-3d1f-490c-99ff-2235ce237eb5-2
00:18:11.983 --> 00:18:13.680
boats on the nose of it.

b94f674e-ed87-4ca8-913f-0512cbef70af-0
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.092
It's going up against another
boat and the sea urchins pushing

b94f674e-ed87-4ca8-913f-0512cbef70af-1
00:18:19.092 --> 00:18:19.840
that boat up.

c8abf307-984b-4a1f-a4ec-bc36462d362d-0
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.444
Now there's some seals playing
where the boat seals are fun and

c8abf307-984b-4a1f-a4ec-bc36462d362d-1
00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:33.460
they like to play a lot. A bunch
of them.

37200532-4664-4465-bc08-2f358b82b392-0
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.852
All the fish are watching that
and all the seals are coming to

37200532-4664-4465-bc08-2f358b82b392-1
00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:40.360
help play with the the boat.

2190643c-60aa-42a0-a58a-4e774a9145c9-0
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.951
There's two boats on top of the
water again, and down below are

2190643c-60aa-42a0-a58a-4e774a9145c9-1
00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:54.360
some some jellyfish and some
other fish, some striped fish.

fa3c6098-7a6c-4a8c-b028-cb85769ab9e1-0
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.219
Down there is a man and little
those tanks and stuff that were

fa3c6098-7a6c-4a8c-b028-cb85769ab9e1-1
00:18:59.219 --> 00:18:59.990
under the sea.

2c49524a-82f7-49d4-ae7f-352a47a09622-0
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.614
Not sure what he's doing on
there. He has a glow glowing

2c49524a-82f7-49d4-ae7f-352a47a09622-1
00:19:04.614 --> 00:19:06.870
ball in his hand and watching
him.

8ef8bae0-6520-43dc-8f9a-21cf51062263-0
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.960
a buoy is a buoy with all kinds
of sea urchins all over it.

5b78ebd9-757c-46bf-8847-50df7151e503-0
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.307
And the birds on top and it's
got a light on top. And there's

5b78ebd9-757c-46bf-8847-50df7151e503-1
00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:27.019
the the the man with it was with
the sea sea gear on, riding a

5b78ebd9-757c-46bf-8847-50df7151e503-2
00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:28.590
strange looking fish.

2ed17f56-9478-4c9d-b906-6481c3f457d4-0
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.829
the boat still going along. And
then there's a lighthouse ahead

2ed17f56-9478-4c9d-b906-6481c3f457d4-1
00:19:33.829 --> 00:19:37.301
and there's a man on the
lighthouse looking out. Don't

2ed17f56-9478-4c9d-b906-6481c3f457d4-2
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:40.520
know if he's looking for that
boat or other boats.

f621628d-f79c-48fa-9f78-656a203a48ee-0
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.610
he is probably the caretaker of
the lighthouse.

5904a888-46e5-4a1e-8e8c-52594b8c96fd-0
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.978
Then there's a giant, giant
bridge, very big, with lots of

5904a888-46e5-4a1e-8e8c-52594b8c96fd-1
00:19:49.978 --> 00:19:50.560
sticks.

202ce26d-e54a-4e71-9739-a2e20bf58957-0
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.640
a little a round building on top
little flag and it goes very

202ce26d-e54a-4e71-9739-a2e20bf58957-1
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.560
long and all the boats are next
to it.

2e9012a8-00d2-4c89-8d88-070bac61986e-0
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.070
Some kind of pier

85b7a106-52ff-4914-84d4-84dffaf3e39b-0
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.150
There's an another boat flowing
along by the big boat.

b761016f-76c7-4e36-80cd-d7e953a8df73-0
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.900
Looks like they're heading to a
town maybe.

1036a1a0-af63-4cbb-9493-3915e72db02f-0
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.093
There's a giant giant whale
looking thing again on looking

1036a1a0-af63-4cbb-9493-3915e72db02f-1
00:20:27.093 --> 00:20:31.710
see animal and there's a little
rowboat with three guys in it.

4620c22a-cc57-4bfd-9c2b-84277c797707-0
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.750
And the buoy

2397165d-6edf-42f6-b24d-30b60bbd8133-0
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.570
And there's.

422dc2ec-996d-48e2-a00e-373aa584dc5e-0
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.166
Oh, there's a one boat. It's got
like a crane thing going up to

422dc2ec-996d-48e2-a00e-373aa584dc5e-1
00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:42.210
meet the giant sea looking
thing.

013ab191-f1e9-4b0c-9a36-929b45c3d753-0
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.662
giant people, there's big old
boats and all the people are

013ab191-f1e9-4b0c-9a36-929b45c3d753-1
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.930
waiting to greet things, greet
everyone.

01c2acbd-bc88-480b-8973-ecab09a49be7-0
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.212
Half of the people up there
greeting waiting for people to

01c2acbd-bc88-480b-8973-ecab09a49be7-1
00:20:53.212 --> 00:20:54.000
come into shore.

52f54ed3-f18a-45ab-a9d2-c58662889d2a-0
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.227
There's a boat with an A little
umbrella on it and someone

52f54ed3-f18a-45ab-a9d2-c58662889d2a-1
00:21:05.227 --> 00:21:08.764
driving that and there's,
there's our paper boat again,

52f54ed3-f18a-45ab-a9d2-c58662889d2a-2
00:21:08.764 --> 00:21:12.870
it's coming into shore too, big
cranes in the background loading

52f54ed3-f18a-45ab-a9d2-c58662889d2a-3
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:13.250
those.

1c5eb365-e05b-4caa-a060-63915b85820e-0
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.940
Train cars off.

e9bdfc97-26d8-4d4a-86e1-f0397094b5a2-0
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.622
Another giant building and it's
holding a boy and a round bubble

e9bdfc97-26d8-4d4a-86e1-f0397094b5a2-1
00:21:21.622 --> 00:21:25.510
type of thing and it looks like
a sea urchin creature again.

a216b631-835d-49f3-a535-a33f8cc5e3e7-0
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.000
more like a machine I think.

1e04ff2f-0a2f-4a95-92cd-52f1f405a856-0
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.798
Ohh, there's oh they caught that
we're looking animal with the

1e04ff2f-0a2f-4a95-92cd-52f1f405a856-1
00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:39.240
weird horn on his head.

6462c34a-9764-4d87-ad20-61938f706ce1-0
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.490
fisherman have caught him. They
got him in a net.

4956c2aa-8723-46b3-969c-24fcacf51731-0
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.092
And two, let lazy dogs are just
looking over the edge of the

4956c2aa-8723-46b3-969c-24fcacf51731-1
00:21:47.092 --> 00:21:50.936
water and the paper boats right
next to that. Again, there's a

4956c2aa-8723-46b3-969c-24fcacf51731-2
00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:54.719
bunch of buildings all around,
one of them called exploratio.

a485bd6e-21d6-4940-ac9f-a5f2aca83523-0
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.035
Being exploring or something,
and then there's a little paper

a485bd6e-21d6-4940-ac9f-a5f2aca83523-1
00:21:59.035 --> 00:22:01.250
boat there that the man's going
out to greet.

5beb8cdb-d409-475f-bd6f-0617dae38ab5-0
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.540
Ohh, and now we're in a city.

a46228cc-51ac-431c-9582-6047329ee53e-0
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.840
a city with water in it.

0b3164c9-5742-4269-8952-bedad39c36d4-0
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:15.131
Like, like kind of like Venice
is little boats floating to the

0b3164c9-5742-4269-8952-bedad39c36d4-1
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.840
city, the water canals and the
city and the giant.

64781ec9-17ee-4c31-96d9-396606c7ed37-0
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.648
Strange thing with wings taken
off from the top of the building

64781ec9-17ee-4c31-96d9-396606c7ed37-1
00:22:23.648 --> 00:22:27.233
and then there's a elk or
something or a reindeer up on

64781ec9-17ee-4c31-96d9-396606c7ed37-2
00:22:27.233 --> 00:22:30.883
top above them, way high on
until they the buildings are

64781ec9-17ee-4c31-96d9-396606c7ed37-3
00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:31.140
all.

6466fc8c-ea65-4d3f-8da4-84c5960f5f5f-0
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.230
Really Cool, cool shape. Kind of
like the the place in Russia.

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-0
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.380
And there's the cat and the
spotted horse and all those

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-1
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.461
other little sea creatures going
up the side of a building, and

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-2
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:55.541
the little boats down below. And
on the other side there's more

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-3
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:59.367
sea creatures. And there's a
little man just sitting on the

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-4
00:22:59.367 --> 00:23:03.447
steps, watching, all smoking a
cigarette. Looks like other ones

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-5
00:23:03.447 --> 00:23:07.209
are sitting up above. Looks like
they're just enjoying the

8fc93a32-589f-480d-9340-d30094e89457-6
00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:09.250
refreshment, watching the water.

85ef3617-a343-4926-af31-ccb622112226-0
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.624
There's the fish watching the
little boat float through the

85ef3617-a343-4926-af31-ccb622112226-1
00:23:19.624 --> 00:23:23.358
canals, and there's a bigger
boat, like the submarine is on

85ef3617-a343-4926-af31-ccb622112226-2
00:23:23.358 --> 00:23:26.720
one side, on the other side is a
little fishing boat.

7ede9315-0e4b-45bd-950e-c2676ff1f05a-0
00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.840
beside it

dee29272-3667-4f40-843d-d3c44a0f5c9e-0
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.550
Paper boat is still floating
along.

60e99441-6ddb-44a0-a967-3e210ef3b47c-0
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:41.611
Paper boat is floating up to a
little house that's lit up and

60e99441-6ddb-44a0-a967-3e210ef3b47c-1
00:23:41.611 --> 00:23:43.370
all trees are around it.

6bcc21a1-21d0-4437-a952-f91d7c791b37-0
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.389
The next one you see the paper
boat. It looks like someone's in

6bcc21a1-21d0-4437-a952-f91d7c791b37-1
00:23:48.389 --> 00:23:49.090
the paper boat.

0f8d4317-c1de-4b55-866f-12025b8ed5e5-0
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.434
#END_wanderer Go and yes, there
is someone in it. And now

0f8d4317-c1de-4b55-866f-12025b8ed5e5-1
00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:58.128
they're getting out of the boat
and looking, going up the

0f8d4317-c1de-4b55-866f-12025b8ed5e5-2
00:23:58.128 --> 00:24:02.205
stairs, looking back at the boat
and he's walking up the stairs

0f8d4317-c1de-4b55-866f-12025b8ed5e5-3
00:24:02.205 --> 00:24:06.154
to see somebody. And then the
next one you see just two pairs

0f8d4317-c1de-4b55-866f-12025b8ed5e5-4
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:09.594
of feet. So he's meeting
somebody at the top of those

0f8d4317-c1de-4b55-866f-12025b8ed5e5-5
00:24:09.594 --> 00:24:10.040
stairs.

c941bf54-6da6-4dc4-b90b-544f795595ab-0
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.220
{Alright, so that was the
story.}

2392c94e-c4a8-41bf-aa28-a8891cc82faa-0
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.464
{So we're going to switch it up.
Looking at the complex screen

2392c94e-c4a8-41bf-aa28-a8891cc82faa-1
00:24:22.464 --> 00:24:24.680
again, my favorite, yes.}

1bef52fa-8b70-461f-acff-3f6c9921009a-0
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.518
#START_by_the_lake after the
excitement of the past few days,

1bef52fa-8b70-461f-acff-3f6c9921009a-1
00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:36.022
the lake is the perfect place
for the Penguins to lie back and

1bef52fa-8b70-461f-acff-3f6c9921009a-2
00:24:36.022 --> 00:24:39.526
relax in the sunshine. There's
plenty to see to keep the young

1bef52fa-8b70-461f-acff-3f6c9921009a-3
00:24:39.526 --> 00:24:43.141
ones entertained. Pee Wee can't
stop playing in the sand and dot

1bef52fa-8b70-461f-acff-3f6c9921009a-4
00:24:43.141 --> 00:24:46.478
us, having a fantastic time
splashing around and trying out

1bef52fa-8b70-461f-acff-3f6c9921009a-5
00:24:46.478 --> 00:24:47.980
the different water sports.

abe3d386-d09f-4fea-8a71-d18b1f418f5e-0
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.335
OK, let's look at this. In the
back we have a the building and

abe3d386-d09f-4fea-8a71-d18b1f418f5e-1
00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:53.840
we have.

d335a8ba-2ed6-44d7-8a75-2925b3f5de28-0
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.446
Oh, a whole slue of Men and
women standing in a pyramid and

d335a8ba-2ed6-44d7-8a75-2925b3f5de28-1
00:24:59.446 --> 00:25:04.153
they're on water boat while
little water paddle boards, so

d335a8ba-2ed6-44d7-8a75-2925b3f5de28-2
00:25:04.153 --> 00:25:05.590
that's hard to do.

1172aa11-ff24-4077-a379-315ec0c2fa2d-0
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.873
12345 layers of them, one on
top, then two, then three and

1172aa11-ff24-4077-a379-315ec0c2fa2d-1
00:25:10.873 --> 00:25:12.250
then more and more.

2a1bdc4b-10c5-4dc1-8c31-2f12da34fd47-0
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.029
And there's a bunch of people
out there parasailing on the

2a1bdc4b-10c5-4dc1-8c31-2f12da34fd47-1
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.330
water.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.836
And then there is sailboats. And
then there's there's a paraglide

6a358162-8813-43c1-ad46-c7fc63720dc2-1
00:25:21.836 --> 00:25:26.133
where you can ride in a boat
closer behind it pulls you up

6a358162-8813-43c1-ad46-c7fc63720dc2-2
00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:27.079
into the air.

798f5c01-a752-442a-837e-e9a18b52f218-0
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.144
There's more boats in the water
and there's back in these

798f5c01-a752-442a-837e-e9a18b52f218-1
00:25:31.144 --> 00:25:34.259
buildings in the background and
then there's a family cooking

798f5c01-a752-442a-837e-e9a18b52f218-2
00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:34.460
out.

7516badc-d107-4aa3-968e-8635c525e609-0
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.391
It's like they're cooking up
lunch or dinner, barbecuing,

7516badc-d107-4aa3-968e-8635c525e609-1
00:25:39.391 --> 00:25:43.441
that's good. Then there's a
rope, men rowing like a rowing

7516badc-d107-4aa3-968e-8635c525e609-2
00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:47.696
team, and they have a dragon
head boat and they're all rowing

7516badc-d107-4aa3-968e-8635c525e609-3
00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:51.746
together. And there's a a man
with and it's just a bathing

7516badc-d107-4aa3-968e-8635c525e609-4
00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:53.600
suit and he's going hurrah.

7a513914-eb14-42d2-9536-8b3c270cdcd1-0
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.920
Then there's a a motorized boat
guy on the water, and then

7a513914-eb14-42d2-9536-8b3c270cdcd1-1
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.530
there's someone and tubes
floating around.

81248ad8-22ad-439f-a34e-a5a00a67eb8c-0
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.636
And then there's a sea. Ohh
some, some are even on sea doos

81248ad8-22ad-439f-a34e-a5a00a67eb8c-1
00:26:06.636 --> 00:26:09.633
out there. I don't know they're
getting around. It's pretty

81248ad8-22ad-439f-a34e-a5a00a67eb8c-2
00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:12.780
crowded out there. Yeah. Then
there's a little platform out in

81248ad8-22ad-439f-a34e-a5a00a67eb8c-3
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.076
the water where they're going to
wrap type of thing where they're

81248ad8-22ad-439f-a34e-a5a00a67eb8c-4
00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:19.322
jumping. All the kids are on it,
climbing on it and then jumping

81248ad8-22ad-439f-a34e-a5a00a67eb8c-5
00:26:19.322 --> 00:26:22.070
out of it and hanging out on it.
Those are always fun.

c923d4ce-d755-4866-959b-ebd74a26aae1-0
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.040
And then there's people in the
water swimming away.

74733f09-dada-44a2-82f4-0bc94529773d-0
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.415
And the guy with a net, he's
probably trying to catch some

74733f09-dada-44a2-82f4-0bc94529773d-1
00:26:30.415 --> 00:26:33.453
fish or something in that water.
I don't think he's gonna find

74733f09-dada-44a2-82f4-0bc94529773d-2
00:26:33.453 --> 00:26:36.347
any, though. And there's some
girls out suntanning and then

74733f09-dada-44a2-82f4-0bc94529773d-3
00:26:36.347 --> 00:26:38.180
they're playing volleyball over
here.

cb662dfe-8c86-4de8-b82e-dc2df5b740af-0
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.240
And they're having fun.

72fed496-8aca-4c87-b4a7-abaefd58cb09-0
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.026
got two teams of Volleyballers
playing, and there's a guy

72fed496-8aca-4c87-b4a7-abaefd58cb09-1
00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:48.984
sitting by a boat serenading his
girlfriend, playing guitar for

72fed496-8aca-4c87-b4a7-abaefd58cb09-2
00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:52.571
her, and some other people with
the Penguin and a guy are

72fed496-8aca-4c87-b4a7-abaefd58cb09-3
00:26:52.571 --> 00:26:54.549
listening to him play his music.

c9c71005-bbe2-431a-a63c-051031d2e9f1-0
00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.720
there is a guy flying a kite up
there and another one over here.

b314036d-fd29-4ace-9c8c-bcdc3fbb8f7d-0
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.980
There's some ice chest and more
people sunbathing, some playing

b314036d-fd29-4ace-9c8c-bcdc3fbb8f7d-1
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.495
and playing with your iPad. That
sounds like perfect what people

b314036d-fd29-4ace-9c8c-bcdc3fbb8f7d-2
00:27:10.495 --> 00:27:11.090
like to do.

73c43560-59e7-4a42-b691-22cce1d7b26e-0
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.419
There's a guy on one of those 2
wheel things that you ride with

73c43560-59e7-4a42-b691-22cce1d7b26e-1
00:27:17.419 --> 00:27:20.596
just the handles riding around
the beach, and there's another

73c43560-59e7-4a42-b691-22cce1d7b26e-2
00:27:20.596 --> 00:27:23.620
raft. They're getting ready to
push a girl into the water.

92c627a9-b5bd-4946-8066-cc83d6ef8747-0
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.050
can't forget the kids making
sandcastles.

9aced2dc-30d7-4481-b308-9ed968ca6c8e-0
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.635
Huge sandcastle has a little
eagle on it and castles and

9aced2dc-30d7-4481-b308-9ed968ca6c8e-1
00:27:32.635 --> 00:27:36.610
everything. It was a good job
and there's a little doggy.

07761d1a-e907-4707-b4fd-727f23bff176-0
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:42.428
Going to play with his his owner
in the water now above water

07761d1a-e907-4707-b4fd-727f23bff176-1
00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:44.680
probably as most people do.

59492ba9-a0ef-4d19-b243-82dd9bf6ab9f-0
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.236
Then some little boys are over
there fishing off the pier, and

59492ba9-a0ef-4d19-b243-82dd9bf6ab9f-1
00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:50.210
little girls too.

84326b43-1b5c-4a27-bc20-296dbe33d629-0
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.149
And then there's a little boy
looks like he's teaching his

84326b43-1b5c-4a27-bc20-296dbe33d629-1
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:57.469
little brother or dad, teaching
his little boy how to swim for

84326b43-1b5c-4a27-bc20-296dbe33d629-2
00:27:57.469 --> 00:27:58.260
the first time.

8cb2cf09-8542-4199-a693-c782a024afe7-0
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.522
And that's always fun. And then
there's the ones that are just

8cb2cf09-8542-4199-a693-c782a024afe7-1
00:28:02.522 --> 00:28:04.090
floating around enjoying the
water.

bdc2cdb2-00f4-4790-821b-b58a6a76866f-0
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.196
#END_by_the_lake And there's
some bicyclists up there, too,

bdc2cdb2-00f4-4790-821b-b58a6a76866f-1
00:28:08.196 --> 00:28:11.810
riding around. I think everybody
in town is at this beach today.

9d97b136-eb69-4e51-85d9-8c4c1b0e5355-0
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.348
{Alright Kate, we can move on to
the next item, which is a

9d97b136-eb69-4e51-85d9-8c4c1b0e5355-1
00:28:21.348 --> 00:28:24.490
graphic novel. It's about 8
pages.}

dfd2d9c5-79bc-4c1b-b18b-05bfce825e0c-0
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.864
#START_arrival-4 Ohh, looks like
this guy just woke up for the

dfd2d9c5-79bc-4c1b-b18b-05bfce825e0c-1
00:28:33.864 --> 00:28:34.950
first thing in the morning.

27732f58-aeb2-457a-b4a2-50f7260c3656-0
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.520
Nice getting ready to get ready.
He's starting to shave.

d1f52103-18f5-4b78-a9d9-b10e1da04d0b-0
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.922
Still got a shaving cream on and
his razor out and a little

d1f52103-18f5-4b78-a9d9-b10e1da04d0b-1
00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:45.860
mirror. He's looking into shade.

b8a0c13e-cb34-4367-991e-69068649a8ad-0
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:51.345
And he's putting on, he got his
dressed and he's buttoning his

b8a0c13e-cb34-4367-991e-69068649a8ad-1
00:28:51.345 --> 00:28:55.194
vest, he's tying his shoes and
he's checking to see how much

b8a0c13e-cb34-4367-991e-69068649a8ad-2
00:28:55.194 --> 00:28:57.150
money he has put in his pocket.

823791c6-4ff5-48de-a9d2-08ee64212916-0
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.320
And then last thing, he's
grabbing his hat and then he's

823791c6-4ff5-48de-a9d2-08ee64212916-1
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.885
looking at a map and trying to
figure out where he has to go

823791c6-4ff5-48de-a9d2-08ee64212916-2
00:29:04.885 --> 00:29:08.624
reading the map. He's standing
there reading the map some more,

823791c6-4ff5-48de-a9d2-08ee64212916-3
00:29:08.624 --> 00:29:12.364
and then there's a little fish
with them, helping them read the

823791c6-4ff5-48de-a9d2-08ee64212916-4
00:29:12.364 --> 00:29:12.539
map

1e1a8ee0-3f76-4ab6-9827-8e25d36319aa-0
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.186
I don't know where the fish came
from. He's walking and following

1e1a8ee0-3f76-4ab6-9827-8e25d36319aa-1
00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:17.580
the man.

2504463e-f2d7-421c-8e15-a0f70e60df1c-0
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.560
Looks like a.

af22160c-affe-4967-9ad8-ed4e9e95fc1e-0
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.490
Busy roads, busy factories and
roads. Still looking at the map

af22160c-affe-4967-9ad8-ed4e9e95fc1e-1
00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.249
and reading it and reading it.
I'm not sure if he's lost. I'm

af22160c-affe-4967-9ad8-ed4e9e95fc1e-2
00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:31.584
not sure if that's a fish
either. It's kind of strange

af22160c-affe-4967-9ad8-ed4e9e95fc1e-3
00:29:31.584 --> 00:29:33.040
looking, a little thing.

59849a49-b45c-4453-9029-c0c5490d293a-0
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.969
And then there's a bunch of
people down below and there's

59849a49-b45c-4453-9029-c0c5490d293a-1
00:29:37.969 --> 00:29:41.645
boats up hanging up above, or
propeller, propeller boats that

59849a49-b45c-4453-9029-c0c5490d293a-2
00:29:41.645 --> 00:29:42.120
can fly.

5e570a26-5d8f-44ad-95db-69e21475d0f3-0
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.312
looks like the people are all
just hanging out waiting to get

5e570a26-5d8f-44ad-95db-69e21475d0f3-1
00:29:46.312 --> 00:29:48.430
take their ride to maybe to work
or something.

5b83d452-524a-49eb-914d-e39fa8c8de6f-0
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.830
Yeah.

f32b52b2-111a-4c54-8f6f-f946e411d67f-0
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.603
That funny little animals got a
different strange looking looks

f32b52b2-111a-4c54-8f6f-f946e411d67f-1
00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:03.600
like a bird type of animal next
to him.

3a0cca8c-e9f5-42ef-bd69-8c9259836967-0
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.247
And he's got real pointy ears. A
bird with real pointy ears. Yes,

3a0cca8c-e9f5-42ef-bd69-8c9259836967-1
00:30:09.247 --> 00:30:13.413
we got bird feet and a bird
tail. Still, looking at the map,

3a0cca8c-e9f5-42ef-bd69-8c9259836967-2
00:30:13.413 --> 00:30:17.648
it seems like he's lost and he's
looking at a woman reading a

3a0cca8c-e9f5-42ef-bd69-8c9259836967-3
00:30:17.648 --> 00:30:17.990
book.

c3314e77-ab20-4851-9df9-bec7b34ebacb-0
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:23.161
he finally goes, looks like all
he's asking for directions. You

c3314e77-ab20-4851-9df9-bec7b34ebacb-1
00:30:23.161 --> 00:30:27.013
show me how to get here. So the
lady looks at the map and she's

c3314e77-ab20-4851-9df9-bec7b34ebacb-2
00:30:27.013 --> 00:30:29.300
pointing out to where he needs
to go.

a0dd2c88-3f66-46c1-bc55-a9c97f0c0489-0
00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.752
And then she says, oh, that's a
strange looking phone, but she's

a0dd2c88-3f66-46c1-bc55-a9c97f0c0489-1
00:30:33.752 --> 00:30:34.910
pointing to a phone there.

734d52c2-914a-45ae-b9c8-715f6b8edea0-0
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.318
And it's a fancy phone. And so
that he's dialing or she's

734d52c2-914a-45ae-b9c8-715f6b8edea0-1
00:30:40.318 --> 00:30:44.941
dialing the phone and that she
pulls a lever and then something

734d52c2-914a-45ae-b9c8-715f6b8edea0-2
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:47.180
comes out. Maybe it's a ticket.

6c1b0294-ba07-4032-a388-1b34b59e5eed-0
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.078
Ticket, and then she gives a
ticket to the man and the man's

6c1b0294-ba07-4032-a388-1b34b59e5eed-1
00:30:53.078 --> 00:30:57.335
looking and they're looking at
it and she's got three fingers

6c1b0294-ba07-4032-a388-1b34b59e5eed-2
00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:58.640
up for some reason.

6d5f7a9c-38be-47c7-abc8-12b9d12c5e78-0
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:05.054
But she's pointing up in the sky
with all the different propeller

6d5f7a9c-38be-47c7-abc8-12b9d12c5e78-1
00:31:05.054 --> 00:31:06.590
vehicles flying around.

8e9a450e-b660-4c38-a3f4-f19014c566a7-0
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.869
They're still waiting and
looking and waiting and looking

8e9a450e-b660-4c38-a3f4-f19014c566a7-1
00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:15.626
and they're waiting and looking
and there's that little animal

8e9a450e-b660-4c38-a3f4-f19014c566a7-2
00:31:15.626 --> 00:31:19.444
again. Ohh. And then it's time
that is a ticket because he just

8e9a450e-b660-4c38-a3f4-f19014c566a7-3
00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:22.963
gave the ticket to the the man
in charge to get on the the

8e9a450e-b660-4c38-a3f4-f19014c566a7-4
00:31:22.963 --> 00:31:26.601
vehicle and the man took his
ticket and told him walked this

8e9a450e-b660-4c38-a3f4-f19014c566a7-5
00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:26.840
way.

40897e6a-5477-48ca-9b11-0cbc37f507a7-0
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.676
Then he found him a bench to sit
on, on, on. He's on there, the

40897e6a-5477-48ca-9b11-0cbc37f507a7-1
00:31:35.676 --> 00:31:40.230
vehicle now and the little weird
animal sitting next to him.

2511e329-c066-4630-bfce-5d3000b9d13f-0
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.352
Oh, she's got the other animal,
the girl that helped him. And so

2511e329-c066-4630-bfce-5d3000b9d13f-1
00:31:45.352 --> 00:31:48.360
they're starting to talk.
They're talking away.

108a469b-2ba9-4993-80c8-a44b69c4a36b-0
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.531
he pulls out a picture. Ohh he's
looking for somebody. He pulled

108a469b-2ba9-4993-80c8-a44b69c4a36b-1
00:31:54.531 --> 00:31:58.935
out a picture and and she's
looking at it and she pulls out

108a469b-2ba9-4993-80c8-a44b69c4a36b-2
00:31:58.935 --> 00:31:59.670
a picture.

6360f526-57ae-4b8b-9400-d1139da63137-0
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.310
And they're both looking at it,
and they both look sad.

6ab62126-b933-43ce-820d-bad34e8e6b85-0
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.400
And she's reading the book.

9a6fa46f-abc7-4c43-8c36-306ad627fe82-0
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.151
Then the man comes and takes the
book from her and puts it in a

9a6fa46f-abc7-4c43-8c36-306ad627fe82-1
00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:19.653
drawer. Looks like he locks her
away. Now she's like a slave and

9a6fa46f-abc7-4c43-8c36-306ad627fe82-2
00:32:19.653 --> 00:32:22.700
having to do shovel coals and
the hot fire.

5d0c1a7a-3cef-4061-84d0-bc5af3416da9-0
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.487
She's shoveling coals and
shoveling coals and a really hot

5d0c1a7a-3cef-4061-84d0-bc5af3416da9-1
00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:31.651
fire. It's hot and smoky, and
then she has to get on top and

5d0c1a7a-3cef-4061-84d0-bc5af3416da9-2
00:32:31.651 --> 00:32:33.289
clean the thing out too.

9b1b5693-02d1-4e69-a4c8-0176cf79c331-0
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.691
She's on top cleaning the thing
out, and there's a bunch of

9b1b5693-02d1-4e69-a4c8-0176cf79c331-1
00:32:42.691 --> 00:32:46.922
women down there having to
shovel the coals into whatever's

9b1b5693-02d1-4e69-a4c8-0176cf79c331-2
00:32:46.922 --> 00:32:50.660
burning down there. She's very
sad she has a shovel.

90279429-b5be-4646-b81c-061caa37b54d-0
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.163
And she figured she could open
the door with the shovel. So she

90279429-b5be-4646-b81c-061caa37b54d-1
00:32:55.163 --> 00:32:57.090
opened the door and she snuck
out.

653e8456-156d-42c3-9185-8fc614297ac4-0
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.292
Went to the next thing and then
she found the keys and she got

653e8456-156d-42c3-9185-8fc614297ac4-1
00:33:02.292 --> 00:33:06.164
her book back out of the drawer.
She's running with her book and

653e8456-156d-42c3-9185-8fc614297ac4-2
00:33:06.164 --> 00:33:09.678
running and running, and she
pops on a train car and she's

653e8456-156d-42c3-9185-8fc614297ac4-3
00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:13.252
sitting in an empty training
car, but she has her book with

653e8456-156d-42c3-9185-8fc614297ac4-4
00:33:13.252 --> 00:33:16.349
her and she's running away and
got away on a train.

b5e6f48c-72c2-4c14-9989-ac12f87f0555-0
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.530
good for her

622ecb5c-4fab-49f0-8492-0ddc5f469465-0
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.049
There's the the flying vehicle
that they're on and they're

622ecb5c-4fab-49f0-8492-0ddc5f469465-1
00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:28.519
talking away, sitting and
talking in the man's announcing

622ecb5c-4fab-49f0-8492-0ddc5f469465-2
00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:31.810
they must have been arriving at
where they were going.

0fb53bb4-3eaa-439a-aa4e-1052626f6b5a-0
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.460
And so that he says goodbye to
her.

d01bca12-d9f4-4895-bbe3-a3302ab4c371-0
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.230
And him and the little.

397b336d-54cf-435c-b42d-ba0ff2ded412-0
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.550
Strange animal thing or walking
away and he said looking,

397b336d-54cf-435c-b42d-ba0ff2ded412-1
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:45.246
thinking, and he's just looking
at this new city that he's gone

397b336d-54cf-435c-b42d-ba0ff2ded412-2
00:33:45.246 --> 00:33:45.420
to.

b18c4493-4408-4181-976a-acff8d66dc59-0
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.690
It's a strange looking city,
yeah.

042ae5ae-8612-4872-a51b-c1c12ec736ca-0
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.533
And then he's walking around his
little funny animal. Lots of

042ae5ae-8612-4872-a51b-c1c12ec736ca-1
00:34:02.533 --> 00:34:04.280
people are walking around.

0b274c30-f478-491d-a4aa-6e368b00bb9e-0
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:11.092
And she's going to look like a
mailbox getting something out of

0b274c30-f478-491d-a4aa-6e368b00bb9e-1
00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:11.280
it.

d2ccadb0-8292-45b3-93c0-2de1d8269c94-0
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.095
And then you see an old man and
a woman and they got looks like

d2ccadb0-8292-45b3-93c0-2de1d8269c94-1
00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:17.000
she bought a fish.

c4f7f55c-b87c-40a8-91d0-ad1be7c6bc44-0
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.940
And then he's just down there
looking at the.

bb9c969b-6c01-44ef-afef-2c9c641860cd-0
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.026
Trying to figure out how to talk
in another language, maybe

bb9c969b-6c01-44ef-afef-2c9c641860cd-1
00:34:28.026 --> 00:34:30.450
because this little book with
him again.

8f4d6258-548b-4825-85bd-0f8d7a88ab07-0
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.700
He's looking and he's looking
and.

5054bcf9-e11b-4cec-ac9e-36339a15b3cb-0
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.065
little animal showing him on
which one to open, which door he

5054bcf9-e11b-4cec-ac9e-36339a15b3cb-1
00:34:39.065 --> 00:34:41.050
should open. He opens that door.

eb928f4d-f2c8-4480-8ab9-1cf63f1b1730-0
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.820
And then you see he's looking in
a book now.

9e159092-c3f7-45f2-b4d6-031a2d2136da-0
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.790
pulling a strange animal out of
the drawer.

703e80c5-4b8c-4432-a959-732583ab423f-0
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.640
Then he's talking to a little
boy.

1e3e8213-1b78-4446-bbb2-9f99783efe42-0
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.570
all of a sudden there's a dad
and a little boy all happy.

92711293-90b8-46d3-8570-9a7c566f3b28-0
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.159
And then they try to hand him.
The little boy tries to hand

92711293-90b8-46d3-8570-9a7c566f3b28-1
00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:05.430
them that, I don't know, it's an
animal or it's a piece of food.

03a5aa28-606f-4f74-9e34-cf567d52aaeb-0
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.852
Still pointing to a picture in
the book, he must a picture in

03a5aa28-606f-4f74-9e34-cf567d52aaeb-1
00:35:09.852 --> 00:35:10.280
the book.

98128ac7-15b0-4026-b10f-11256e41a8e8-0
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.094
And a man goes over and shows
them which one to push and he

98128ac7-15b0-4026-b10f-11256e41a8e8-1
00:35:15.094 --> 00:35:18.280
opens that and he brings out
another funny looking thing.

0a112085-5af0-45e6-b1dc-9fabed760c35-0
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.064
With food though, and he's
taking a bite of that food, and

0a112085-5af0-45e6-b1dc-9fabed760c35-1
00:35:23.064 --> 00:35:27.112
the little boy is bringing him a
basket and they give the basket

0a112085-5af0-45e6-b1dc-9fabed760c35-2
00:35:27.112 --> 00:35:30.910
to the man and the boy in the
center standing there with the

0a112085-5af0-45e6-b1dc-9fabed760c35-3
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.160
man.

eafaecbc-946e-4a4f-8c46-6dec38c1646c-0
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.960
And then he's got more food,
more different kinds of food.

d0ac024d-52d7-42f5-8c96-945735e5e668-0
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.370
strange looking food I've never
seen before.

32f8b156-3826-48d8-b22c-c19c4208b083-0
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:48.088
they seem to like it and are
eating it, somebody. Somebody's

32f8b156-3826-48d8-b22c-c19c4208b083-1
00:35:48.088 --> 00:35:48.690
real giant.

884aeef1-0bb7-498d-9993-1ff89543e33e-0
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.822
Then cutting it and they said,
oh, it tastes good. Then they're

884aeef1-0bb7-498d-9993-1ff89543e33e-1
00:35:55.822 --> 00:35:58.520
breaking it in half and sharing
it with the man.

c7ce34b9-9ebd-488c-92cc-155a515c218a-0
00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.951
Ohh they gave him some to his
little pet too. They gave him a

c7ce34b9-9ebd-488c-92cc-155a515c218a-1
00:36:03.951 --> 00:36:08.215
whole basketball, all this
different food. And a little

c7ce34b9-9ebd-488c-92cc-155a515c218a-2
00:36:08.215 --> 00:36:13.089
boy's whispering to the dad and
the man puts his arm around the

c7ce34b9-9ebd-488c-92cc-155a515c218a-3
00:36:13.089 --> 00:36:17.734
man that he was helping, and
little boys showing him the way

c7ce34b9-9ebd-488c-92cc-155a515c218a-4
00:36:17.734 --> 00:36:22.380
and they go off together walking
together. How nice of them.

8bfb0596-b313-4239-b150-bedb61b6a9f8-0
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.567
And they're walking towards a
boat and then they're walking.

8bfb0596-b313-4239-b150-bedb61b6a9f8-1
00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.350
They have a big jar or
something.

06358252-3eec-4773-9f9c-b0441b5ed3ca-0
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.490
Ohh, there's an animal inside
that jar.

b1739a35-194f-48fb-82fd-103ea2ce13c8-0
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.676
And it's tails coming out and
the man drops the basket going,

b1739a35-194f-48fb-82fd-103ea2ce13c8-1
00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:43.340
what is that?

93f42d24-cf37-4557-b033-4d9d3d01f365-0
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:48.646
Like kind of the dad in the
center laughing because it's a

93f42d24-cf37-4557-b033-4d9d3d01f365-1
00:36:48.646 --> 00:36:50.620
it's like a cat looking animal.

8caf6a82-b78b-4165-b926-7f11f0000d87-0
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.673
And he's looking at the, the
strange man and the and the

8caf6a82-b78b-4165-b926-7f11f0000d87-1
00:36:55.673 --> 00:36:56.850
dad's laughing again.

fd65f2a2-d786-4aba-b70b-1dd6427e5770-0
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.630
And then they the.

c8eb6a62-47d9-490b-9db4-2420503af86e-0
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:05.665
The cat and the strange animal
are looking at each other and

c8eb6a62-47d9-490b-9db4-2420503af86e-1
00:37:05.665 --> 00:37:07.480
he's picking up his fruit.

fa0d463c-15f2-4c6d-81a3-bb4b49bb8d21-0
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.850

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.248
And he draws a house and this,
and this and this book. Now he's

971c0d09-2ab5-4c73-88fd-b93b301ad59f-1
00:37:18.248 --> 00:37:21.791
drawing a house at three
buildings and the tail of that

971c0d09-2ab5-4c73-88fd-b93b301ad59f-2
00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:22.930
weird looking cat.

5a22e73d-6e0d-4102-b43b-2f80d677c0da-0
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.375
Then he shows the man, the
picture man. Oh, that's really

5a22e73d-6e0d-4102-b43b-2f80d677c0da-1
00:37:28.375 --> 00:37:32.176

it's it's touching his heart

5a22e73d-6e0d-4102-b43b-2f80d677c0da-2

00131f21-24bb-4c29-9315-fda1dcfd68ad-0
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.319
#END_arrival-4 We're not sure
what's going on here. They just

00131f21-24bb-4c29-9315-fda1dcfd68ad-1

there.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.770
{ I will see another part of the
story now.}

95e03ae3-2702-423b-8670-e8b0510504ee-0
00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.821
#START_arrival-5 Now there's a
big city and on the top of bird

95e03ae3-2702-423b-8670-e8b0510504ee-1
00:37:55.821 --> 00:37:59.338
looking buildings, but they have
eyes and the beak almost looks

95e03ae3-2702-423b-8670-e8b0510504ee-2
00:37:59.338 --> 00:38:02.800
like a bunch of birds on top of
there. With their giant birds,

95e03ae3-2702-423b-8670-e8b0510504ee-3
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.987
they look like part of the
building. Down below there's a

95e03ae3-2702-423b-8670-e8b0510504ee-4
00:38:05.987 --> 00:38:08.350
bunch of boats and then there's
the water.

1d59a429-1eb3-42f5-ba2b-fdc7fb46a824-0
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.779
And then there's the same man,
but he's got a kind of a cat

1d59a429-1eb3-42f5-ba2b-fdc7fb46a824-1
00:38:13.779 --> 00:38:16.110

a rope.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.234
And then in the next one, he's
showing the man the way and the

eb4c947b-003e-4276-97f1-df2b39ebfc58-1
00:38:21.234 --> 00:38:24.619

little animals following him

00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:27.440
with the Big bowl of fruit that
they had veggies.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.200
And you bring it to the mom. The
little boy gives it to the mom.

7c684a44-7fdc-4cf9-b56c-e83807f480d9-0
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.871
and the mom and the husband
kisses the mom and he introduces

7c684a44-7fdc-4cf9-b56c-e83807f480d9-1
00:38:35.871 --> 00:38:39.030
the man to her and she says
welcome, come on in.

984ef822-059b-4609-8ad0-cb299b7fb45f-0
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.590
Share a drink together.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.580
And then they got their food and
she's cutting the food up.

2ef2d0a8-721d-4191-8180-a9a2c1d5376c-0
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.805
And it looks like he's gonna
make something to drink. And

2ef2d0a8-721d-4191-8180-a9a2c1d5376c-1
00:38:48.805 --> 00:38:51.548
they're, oh, they're cooking the
meat up, they're basting. It

2ef2d0a8-721d-4191-8180-a9a2c1d5376c-2
00:38:51.548 --> 00:38:54.070
looks like they're going to cook
up a nice meal for him.

325b8cb9-6481-4505-bb93-85453504a0cd-0
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.418
The little boys feeding the two
animals from the table, that's

325b8cb9-6481-4505-bb93-85453504a0cd-1
00:39:04.418 --> 00:39:05.910
typical little boy thing.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:11.889
and the man's firing up whatever
he's cooking kind of roasting it

5cd70edc-edbd-4246-b570-dcd7b7b1c9b7-1
00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:12.780
with a torch.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.090
A man and a woman are having a
good conversation.

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-0
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.999
Man's drinking looks like
they're drinking, maybe drinking

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-1
00:39:21.999 --> 00:39:25.238
a little bit of wine, and
they're having fun. And she says

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-2
00:39:25.238 --> 00:39:28.696
she's laughing, he's laughing.
They're strangers laughing. And

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-3
00:39:28.696 --> 00:39:32.210
the man starts playing music and
oh, the woman plays, Mom plays

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-4
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.394
music too, and the little boy
plays music. So they're all

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-5
00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:38.853
playing music on their different
instruments. And then the man

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-6
00:39:38.853 --> 00:39:41.982

it, fold it makes a little

097ba89f-73fb-4adc-ba7c-657ebe26d5b8-7

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.904
And he gives it to the little
boy. Little man takes the the

c65ff2c8-88f0-443c-afd5-663bfc016342-1
00:39:47.904 --> 00:39:52.145
dad takes a cup and takes it out
of the drawer cupboard. And they

c65ff2c8-88f0-443c-afd5-663bfc016342-2
00:39:52.145 --> 00:39:56.128
they got it, mom and him having
them both hands. I'm not sure

c65ff2c8-88f0-443c-afd5-663bfc016342-3
00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:59.020
what's in that bowl, but it must
be special.

81a99851-e826-4317-9973-65c6e3932e32-0
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.126

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.177
And then the little boy is
waking up little. And I said, oh

3287abee-ad65-455e-bce2-f1ed40380b9a-1
00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:16.940

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.895
in the bed with them and he's
petting his little pet and he's

3287abee-ad65-455e-bce2-f1ed40380b9a-3
00:40:20.895 --> 00:40:24.595
getting dressed. And then he's
cutting some food and he's

3287abee-ad65-455e-bce2-f1ed40380b9a-4
00:40:24.595 --> 00:40:28.550

pet, brings him his hat.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.400
And he's walking off with this
little pet

8c6f96f0-cd11-4bfd-b4fa-1ad8bd7b4458-0
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.600

bunch of strange looking fish.

doing business. Somebody's

And then there's some boy ohh
the boys. They caught a fish,

92c22cef-997a-497e-8220-af23db877855-1
00:43:00.097 --> 00:43:02.800
but the fish is taking all of
them underneath the sea.

05c1b241-f21f-4fe8-a099-cfcdc587903b-0
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.550
They couldn't get it.

679e779d-1419-4859-8f91-3684565a67b3-0
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.684
And another guy with this kind
of spear of fish, but he speared

679e779d-1419-4859-8f91-3684565a67b3-1
00:43:09.684 --> 00:43:11.270
somebody in the bottom instead.

59756ef2-4285-4d41-b5aa-2590ece73ecb-0
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.090
Lot of chaos and there's a shark
going after these guys.

508cfe68-05cd-4ce4-a08d-346f8bc650db-0
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.540
a little breakfast there's
another mermaid under the sea.

41ed13a9-e36e-4695-adbd-0eeb4479e842-0
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.606
And then a bunch of mermaids
under the sea, not just the ones

41ed13a9-e36e-4695-adbd-0eeb4479e842-1
00:43:27.606 --> 00:43:30.200
on the rocks. There's a bunch
under the sea, too.

e3250deb-1467-4ac5-b54a-2c12eab10eae-0
00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.318
And then there's a one guy gotta
catch a giant fish. I bet it's

e3250deb-1467-4ac5-b54a-2c12eab10eae-1
00:43:34.318 --> 00:43:36.590
going to pull him and his boat
under the water.

54008d3c-fc15-4add-860e-f222766967c7-0
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:42.302
There's a woman's scuba diving
men scuba diving over here and

54008d3c-fc15-4add-860e-f222766967c7-1
00:43:42.302 --> 00:43:46.850
over here. There's the ice skate
under there. What the heck is an

54008d3c-fc15-4add-860e-f222766967c7-2
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:47.540
ice skate?

58f76038-27f8-4122-876f-ba7d1e1c59d2-0
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.390
Oh, there's some jellyfish.

99aba408-bb0b-4fd0-8af7-a37a0c60436b-0
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.290
There are some schools of fish.

2d496173-d3b9-4bbf-9b65-ff414f3c3c4e-0
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.670
There's one other guy with a
net.

c29d4874-9ee5-4c0c-8b47-f217820a77c9-0
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.673
There's a guy covered in fish in
there. The other guys are

c29d4874-9ee5-4c0c-8b47-f217820a77c9-1
00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:03.320
spearing him.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.330
Fishing down here, this looks
like the guys.

c0ea8ab3-d325-4be6-9a82-a523ef29c55b-0
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.640
One guy's got a line, the other
guys gonna catch it.

41e45bfa-ec27-49b1-a78f-bb5e6f29b741-0
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.237
And there's more people walking
on the bottom and they're

41e45bfa-ec27-49b1-a78f-bb5e6f29b741-1
00:44:18.237 --> 00:44:20.000
stepping on crabs, getting their
feet bit.

ab42043f-aed3-4992-9b03-0153d9ff0769-0
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.750
The crabs are biting them.

7bc31618-fe9c-476f-9c6d-560758cfee01-0
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.552
There's a big old hand that
looks looks like a hand, but

7bc31618-fe9c-476f-9c6d-560758cfee01-1
00:44:26.552 --> 00:44:28.170
it's actually fish on top of it.

d3585e7b-aed3-4db6-9ee3-58e5e005f1c7-0
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.070
Another guy with the fishnet and
there's an octopus.

3b43e86d-62fa-4071-a921-bb70d137e410-0
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.960
little octopus. They're all
looking at. They don't see the

3b43e86d-62fa-4071-a921-bb70d137e410-1
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.591
big Mama octopus behind them.
Not happy. They're picking on

3b43e86d-62fa-4071-a921-bb70d137e410-2
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:41.560
her little baby.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.601
And there's a catfish. It's
really got a cat head and a fish

5875ebc6-3bef-4379-925b-57abe84eb779-1
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:46.880

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.150
And then there's a dog.

3c0cfa75-b6e9-40c0-9c03-5e71e5333351-0
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.860
Right, the strange things under
this ocean.

8f0579a0-6901-4fe9-a790-0c8b38a612a9-0
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.731
Yeah, these guys are riding on.
They think it's a rock, but it's

8f0579a0-6901-4fe9-a790-0c8b38a612a9-1
00:44:58.731 --> 00:45:01.890
a giant fish they're riding on.
You know? He's happy.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:08.300
And then there's a seal with a
lions head on it. That is funny.

0b3c1cc5-d499-42f3-abd5-45397ba9a232-0
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.340
Is that a lionfish?

4f68a0ba-277e-4d74-b965-cf1504dac6fe-0
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.700

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:19.760
And then then then one of the
mermaids is getting a drink.

1a25ebd5-6957-4546-9601-97941c31daf6-0
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.084

water, but it looks better.

f04abcb0-7aaa-446f-9fac-bd678fb9d89e-0

A swordfish, only it has a real
sword on his ohh his nose

f04abcb0-7aaa-446f-9fac-bd678fb9d89e-1

Ohh, there's some guys above the
water. They don't realize they

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.596
got there in the middle of a
shark swimming around. Oh, but

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.960
it's not a shark, it's a guy
pulling a prank on them.

00:46:47.766 --> 00:46:52.138

man looks like he might be

00:46:58.864 --> 00:47:02.789

He has a strange looking

like he's just came into town.

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:59.231
He's got a suitcase and he looks
like he's pondering where where

e70deee0-8ab0-4e31-9b2b-5bc27f0a68c5-2
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.980

keeps looking at it looking up

little suitcase.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.930
Walking down the street some
more, walking some more.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.105
He looks up and he sees these
little bright shiny ball things.

b7cb0f7c-30bf-4968-b908-7ce308e827b2-1
00:48:25.105 --> 00:48:27.180

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.588
And all of a sudden this hat
comes, blows off. It takes this

00:48:32.588 --> 00:48:36.633
hat right off his head, yes, and
the hat falls on the ground with

00:48:36.633 --> 00:48:40.433
arrows pointing. It picks up his
hat and he's looking at this

7500f001-259d-4f69-9272-16fa4f85b153-3
00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:41.720

book again, and he's all of a

f74ad5cb-f5ab-4c40-a732-8df8a0747f69-2
00:48:51.283 --> 00:48:53.780
sudden the man reaches out his
hand.

08ccf72a-f3d1-426a-8960-24196157e485-0
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.920
He's he's he's asking if he
could help him.

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-0
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.648
#END_arrival-3 trying to tell my
what he needs and the man's

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-1
00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:06.302
thinking about it and listening
to him and listening to him, but

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-2
00:49:06.302 --> 00:49:10.012
he draws him picture so he could
understand because I don't think

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-3
00:49:10.012 --> 00:49:13.722
they speak the same language. He
draws him a picture of a bed and

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-4
00:49:13.722 --> 00:49:17.094
a window and he goes, I know
what you want now, so, the man

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-5
00:49:17.094 --> 00:49:20.298
said, looking at him and shows
him come with me and he's

b0f2b2f4-85f1-445d-8831-369559382ac0-6
00:49:20.298 --> 00:49:23.390
carrying this strange looking
pet out of his backpack.

b4f2f73b-74ea-43c0-aa1b-ac7868e0faf9-0
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.940
{OK, so this is another part of
this story.

33a8519b-4760-4c3b-b4cb-f57f19e43ef0-0
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.300
And then we'll go to see another
part.}

53a9a9e9-7def-408a-a2f8-d99df99d9689-0
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.320
#START_arrival-6 There's the jar
again.

b54c190d-3df4-48ae-83ce-ab9247287378-0
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.534
Jars all by itself and then a
little fish looking thing is

b54c190d-3df4-48ae-83ce-ab9247287378-1
00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:43.030
coming to land on the jar.

0d65603f-2939-40ce-a0d4-903d3f9b3fa2-0
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.130
Looks like he's trying to eat
something out of it.

5dd7d135-3622-4bae-b9bb-84978e220278-0
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.881
then you see the reflection of
the man in the mirror and he has

5dd7d135-3622-4bae-b9bb-84978e220278-1
00:49:50.881 --> 00:49:53.180
a lamp and he's writing a
letter, it looks like.

659ca40c-7a6c-4f04-a12f-e456f4fbdfd5-0
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.360
He's got the old kind of pen and
quill, quill and ink pen to

659ca40c-7a6c-4f04-a12f-e456f4fbdfd5-1
00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.520
write the letter.

ea2e282d-6283-40c2-9ba3-2a3b723685c1-0
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.910
That's a long time ago. If
they're writing with that, yeah.

ea2e282d-6283-40c2-9ba3-2a3b723685c1-1
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.179
And he's got his money on the
table and he's folding his

ea2e282d-6283-40c2-9ba3-2a3b723685c1-2
00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:10.620
little letter up. He's folding
it into the shape of a bird.

5a30afb5-8ad2-415c-a020-49cf82d1930d-0
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.790
And then it's putting it inside
an envelope.

79111acf-48a7-416f-9c08-13e82be5fde2-0
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.596
And he's looking about how much
money he has and looking for a

79111acf-48a7-416f-9c08-13e82be5fde2-1
00:50:18.596 --> 00:50:22.101
stamp, I think. And he's licking
the envelope and he puts a stamp

79111acf-48a7-416f-9c08-13e82be5fde2-2
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:22.420
on it.

138b9873-50b5-465f-8b03-59f1f5572388-0
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:27.343
Then he goes out with his little
pet and he goes and sees a woman

138b9873-50b5-465f-8b03-59f1f5572388-1
00:50:27.343 --> 00:50:30.662
there asking her where he can
mail the letter. He says she

138b9873-50b5-465f-8b03-59f1f5572388-2
00:50:30.662 --> 00:50:33.926
points to where she can go to
the mailbox there, mail his

138b9873-50b5-465f-8b03-59f1f5572388-3
00:50:33.926 --> 00:50:34.320
letter.

f20cab24-6880-4738-bec0-7b3cbc6d5a92-0
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.700
So he goes up to the mailbox.
He's trying to figure it out.

57ef2889-c632-4ea9-b86f-9d01e1f87bb2-0
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.050
He figures out how to open it
and puts it in there.

84d09159-b702-4621-9c8c-f5cbab6dd429-0
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:46.313
And then he's looking up at the
sky. I don't know if he's lonely

84d09159-b702-4621-9c8c-f5cbab6dd429-1
00:50:46.313 --> 00:50:49.728
or what, and then you see him
walking down, always watching it

84d09159-b702-4621-9c8c-f5cbab6dd429-2
00:50:49.728 --> 00:50:53.197
take off. Apparently this letter
has an air balloon attached to

84d09159-b702-4621-9c8c-f5cbab6dd429-3
00:50:53.197 --> 00:50:53.360
it.

0dd5f8f9-3edb-4590-8f4b-ad84f7dee5ab-0
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:55.470
must be airmail.

378d00e1-d4ef-48d9-a8ec-4f82cbf68ad9-0
00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.907
And then he's walking down the
hill, walking away from them and

378d00e1-d4ef-48d9-a8ec-4f82cbf68ad9-1
00:51:00.907 --> 00:51:02.520
the mailbox it just took off.

597cd98e-7262-4c01-be73-a4bce7c0cd57-0
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.870
Then there's a leaf.

7565e5c1-b19a-4d75-b970-c6a9d3f802e8-0
00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:14.589
Is there again leaf is
splitting? Ohh it's not really a

7565e5c1-b19a-4d75-b970-c6a9d3f802e8-1
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:16.200
leaf, it's a bird.

8fc05cee-06a2-46be-950e-1b83c5da6df6-0
00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:22.050
A bird or a flower, maybe a
flower spreading open and then

8fc05cee-06a2-46be-950e-1b83c5da6df6-1
00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.896
it has a little round thing in
the middle. Once it's totally

8fc05cee-06a2-46be-950e-1b83c5da6df6-2
00:51:25.896 --> 00:51:28.230
spread open, there's a little
round.

849c68c3-eb74-4dc3-b93b-3e4bf6fa5bd3-0
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:32.947
Flower opening and it's brighter
and brighter. It's really

849c68c3-eb74-4dc3-b93b-3e4bf6fa5bd3-1
00:51:32.947 --> 00:51:37.283
shimmering in the night and it's
brighter and brighter and then

849c68c3-eb74-4dc3-b93b-3e4bf6fa5bd3-2
00:51:37.283 --> 00:51:38.909
it's back to dull again.

8bc08d58-5ed4-4cf3-a905-bdd35d8357df-0
00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:41.540
And then there's another flower.

da2be3e8-4c1b-4120-b1f7-d8d141a717f7-0
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.206
it's different and it's growing.
Little buds on it, almost like

da2be3e8-4c1b-4120-b1f7-d8d141a717f7-1
00:51:46.206 --> 00:51:46.550
pearls.

f3782a91-8d89-4b7e-aba1-0eeb0864fea8-0
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.954
And then they dropped on the
ground. That little lamb was

f3782a91-8d89-4b7e-aba1-0eeb0864fea8-1
00:51:49.954 --> 00:51:52.777
like they might be eating them,
so maybe it's some kind of

f3782a91-8d89-4b7e-aba1-0eeb0864fea8-2
00:51:52.777 --> 00:51:54.500
fruit. And then the tree is
barren.

add0d1b3-6ab9-4db1-8fbb-1f48c2b6316a-0
00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:58.818
And then there is a fading
looking one and it looks like

add0d1b3-6ab9-4db1-8fbb-1f48c2b6316a-1
00:51:58.818 --> 00:52:01.920
the leaves are falling. It's
getting less leaves and less

add0d1b3-6ab9-4db1-8fbb-1f48c2b6316a-2
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.150
leaves and less leaves.

082245e5-9341-4550-98a3-8f3839dcc598-0
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.509
and less leaves until there's
just a bare bare shape of a

082245e5-9341-4550-98a3-8f3839dcc598-1
00:52:08.509 --> 00:52:10.470
flower with nothing left.

1e3c6735-e841-4bea-9866-fed9d2591886-0
00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:16.920
Then we're in a giant.

edb4814d-a9c6-42ef-b685-810c589fb50e-0
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.577
City, factory, whatever it is,
it's a big place. The plane, the

edb4814d-a9c6-42ef-b685-810c589fb50e-1
00:52:23.577 --> 00:52:27.580
strange looking air air vehicles
flying around.

0a3b78f3-83dd-47c1-883f-760d4b6a1d34-0
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.020
Steam coming out of a lot of
steam pipes out there.

f3cc37b9-ed63-4504-88ab-b9d4d331cf82-0
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:40.570
Pyramid shaped buildings. Very
interesting looking place.

ea85d645-6c69-4973-9fae-f8b2b718041a-0
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:47.573
There's the jar again. Oh, and
there's babies inside the jar

ea85d645-6c69-4973-9fae-f8b2b718041a-1
00:52:47.573 --> 00:52:51.540
now, and the fish looking thing
is coming to feed her babies.

f9138075-6d01-4520-a617-c2d87f4b6e78-0
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:54.400
123 she feeds them.

fce8864b-b5b9-4bf7-9766-fa9f991be428-0
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.961
And there's the man in his room
all by himself. He's lonely. I

fce8864b-b5b9-4bf7-9766-fa9f991be428-1
00:52:58.961 --> 00:53:01.688
think he misses his family
because he's looking at a

fce8864b-b5b9-4bf7-9766-fa9f991be428-2
00:53:01.688 --> 00:53:02.820
picture of his family.

792479c1-e6d9-4210-b78b-f34b2841a7ec-0
00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:08.910
Then there's little pets there
and his pets sleeping and his

792479c1-e6d9-4210-b78b-f34b2841a7ec-1
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:09.640
pet wakes up.

4017cb95-414a-443e-b43d-1e5f2de41396-0
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.090
The pets running down.

823a247f-5d63-4783-848d-c8119615e808-0
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.427
And then guys looking for words
to pet going, he's running down

823a247f-5d63-4783-848d-c8119615e808-1
00:53:16.427 --> 00:53:20.084
the stairs, so he goes down the
ladder and follows him down the

823a247f-5d63-4783-848d-c8119615e808-2
00:53:20.084 --> 00:53:23.170
ladder. At the bottom of the
ladder there's a letter.

163a982a-f695-4460-9986-f19c23c60918-0
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:27.784
The pet shows him it's a letter
and he opens the letter and then

163a982a-f695-4460-9986-f19c23c60918-1
00:53:27.784 --> 00:53:31.728
the bird shaped letter he sent a
bird shaped letter, came back to

163a982a-f695-4460-9986-f19c23c60918-2
00:53:31.728 --> 00:53:35.075
him and it's written. It's
probably from his family and

163a982a-f695-4460-9986-f19c23c60918-3
00:53:35.075 --> 00:53:36.450
it's made him so happy.

7124ce78-f644-42e1-94b6-114a080edb2c-0
00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.850
then there's the paper shape
looking crab looking thing.

2e84787b-e72b-4b03-9367-ae5464ff9ec6-0
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.150
Funny looking oven type of
thing.

a8893626-c18a-4004-867d-234d05a893ed-0
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.070
And there's a hat.

e2fe0462-3a53-41b6-a08d-90361f2a71bd-0
00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:55.280
And a coat rack.

750847d7-bd81-4bab-bf70-8117cdbaf2df-0
00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:00.313
And both of strange looking
things. It's a picture of the

750847d7-bd81-4bab-bf70-8117cdbaf2df-1
00:54:00.313 --> 00:54:02.050
flying machine in the air.

da7eea47-0227-4667-b2c2-b570d275f8b3-0
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.937
Little contraption, not sure
what that is. A cup of must be a

da7eea47-0227-4667-b2c2-b570d275f8b3-1
00:54:07.937 --> 00:54:11.574
coffee maker because you had a
cup of coffee and then there's

da7eea47-0227-4667-b2c2-b570d275f8b3-2
00:54:11.574 --> 00:54:13.099
the picture of his family.

e834b48e-08f6-4d4f-b83a-22a414d7e005-0
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.900
There is pain, but somebody some
money, maybe for the coffee.

9dd532a1-d0e3-43a2-8075-c898dc2b1488-0
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.552
Ohh, looks like he's found his
family came to see him maybe.

9dd532a1-d0e3-43a2-8075-c898dc2b1488-1
00:54:24.552 --> 00:54:28.027
And he's got his wife and his
little girl with him and the

9dd532a1-d0e3-43a2-8075-c898dc2b1488-2
00:54:28.027 --> 00:54:31.090
little pet looking for food
dropping off the table.

10a39bce-43d9-4be5-8ab8-68fc4c200e3a-0

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:39.090
There's a girl with wings.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.790
scroll in their hand.

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.171
might be a girl might be a boy.
This is for Darcy and a bench

955d4012-68ed-4660-84e8-afd114d5899a-1
00:55:47.171 --> 00:55:51.295
and a little porch light. And
the next scene is two children

955d4012-68ed-4660-84e8-afd114d5899a-2
00:55:51.295 --> 00:55:55.622
under a tunnel. One has a purple
bird with a purple crayon, and

955d4012-68ed-4660-84e8-afd114d5899a-3
00:55:55.622 --> 00:55:59.746
the girl girl has a red crayon
in her hand. And then over on

955d4012-68ed-4660-84e8-afd114d5899a-4
00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:03.937
the bicycle they painted one
wheel red and one wheell purple,

955d4012-68ed-4660-84e8-afd114d5899a-5
00:56:03.937 --> 00:56:06.980
and there's a door there they're
looking at.

1c2e0cff-02a7-4366-8632-2c391dc23f4a-0
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:18.571
Ohh and it looks like the King
has opened the door and he's

1c2e0cff-02a7-4366-8632-2c391dc23f4a-1
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:23.251
showing them a picture. A
special picture with circles of

1c2e0cff-02a7-4366-8632-2c391dc23f4a-2
00:56:23.251 --> 00:56:25.350
purple and red and yellow.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.026
And that purple bird is back
again. The little boy with the

38a514b3-7839-4307-90b5-34e408ba49c8-1
00:56:30.026 --> 00:56:34.104
purple crayon, a little girl
with a red crayon, or looking at

38a514b3-7839-4307-90b5-34e408ba49c8-2
00:56:34.104 --> 00:56:37.130
the king and he's telling them,
shh be quiet.

3ec63c70-1a84-4be5-8e9b-0034d7091b46-0
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.385
Gives the little boy a scroll
and he pushes like looks like a

3ec63c70-1a84-4be5-8e9b-0034d7091b46-1
00:56:44.385 --> 00:56:48.292
bullet sling around the little
girl and he's showing them where

3ec63c70-1a84-4be5-8e9b-0034d7091b46-2
00:56:48.292 --> 00:56:49.880
to go. He's saying go now.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.430
And then the guards are coming
out to grab the king.

92726072-fa18-4c98-b8c9-1f10e5490cdf-0
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.936
And they grabbed the king and
pulled them back inside the

92726072-fa18-4c98-b8c9-1f10e5490cdf-1
00:56:56.936 --> 00:56:57.160
door.

55129304-51ef-48c7-befd-0a15b9ec8514-0
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:01.501

king away.

3db936e7-d5a7-42c0-b3c7-0a04ea107fdd-0
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:06.692
little purple birds on the boys
shoulder watching them too and

3db936e7-d5a7-42c0-b3c7-0a04ea107fdd-1
00:57:06.692 --> 00:57:08.570
dropped his yellow crayon too.

1f067f67-c44f-4de0-9f4b-bac3355b61ac-0
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:18.459
So she puts a little crayon in
her little belt. Ohh that's it's

1f067f67-c44f-4de0-9f4b-bac3355b61ac-1
00:57:18.459 --> 00:57:21.922
a belt. A whole different
different magic crayons. She

1f067f67-c44f-4de0-9f4b-bac3355b61ac-2
00:57:21.922 --> 00:57:25.763
puts the King's yellow in her
belt and she's got the red one

1f067f67-c44f-4de0-9f4b-bac3355b61ac-3
00:57:25.763 --> 00:57:29.730
in her hand and the little boy
has the purple one in his hand.

eb40beb5-ff36-44e5-be70-b208a76102e4-0
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.800
They're looking at each other.

e4e593c1-9b58-4ba4-9c88-1630e8fae43c-0
00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:36.171
And then on the next picture
they're starting to draw and

e4e593c1-9b58-4ba4-9c88-1630e8fae43c-1
00:57:36.171 --> 00:57:40.023
they both draw keys. That's what
they both Drew and you keys to

e4e593c1-9b58-4ba4-9c88-1630e8fae43c-2
00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:43.575
open the doors. One opens one
side and one opens the other

e4e593c1-9b58-4ba4-9c88-1630e8fae43c-3
00:57:43.575 --> 00:57:47.247
side and into the door they go
and the little Purple bird is

e4e593c1-9b58-4ba4-9c88-1630e8fae43c-4
00:57:47.247 --> 00:57:48.150
following them.

2bc53f00-b024-4ad5-8d61-0aafef6d98a7-0
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.351
And there's a big castle, Ohh
it's ginormous castle and it's

2bc53f00-b024-4ad5-8d61-0aafef6d98a7-1
00:57:56.351 --> 00:57:59.839
got a Moat and it's got a
waterfall and it's flying

2bc53f00-b024-4ad5-8d61-0aafef6d98a7-2
00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:03.729
machines with men and them all
around. And there's guards

2bc53f00-b024-4ad5-8d61-0aafef6d98a7-3
00:58:03.729 --> 00:58:07.620
around the castle and they see
the king on a boat and the

2bc53f00-b024-4ad5-8d61-0aafef6d98a7-4
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:11.979
guards are taking him away down
the river on the the Moat River.

c5870c1d-6d75-4efd-accb-9b0b028b98ca-0
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:15.961
Little boy and a little girl on
a rock trying to figure out how

c5870c1d-6d75-4efd-accb-9b0b028b98ca-1
00:58:15.961 --> 00:58:17.160
they can go help the king.

6b274c12-d2da-498a-baed-39d1762ddeb7-0
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:25.859
Looking at the circle that the
king gave him the piece of

6b274c12-d2da-498a-baed-39d1762ddeb7-1
00:58:25.859 --> 00:58:26.140
paper.

b471ffb0-5113-42f7-8ed6-593b5180cf6a-0
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.108
Looking at it to figure out what
to do and the little purple

b471ffb0-5113-42f7-8ed6-593b5180cf6a-1
00:58:31.108 --> 00:58:34.663
birds looking in the water and
they keep getting farther away

b471ffb0-5113-42f7-8ed6-593b5180cf6a-2
00:58:34.663 --> 00:58:38.391
and up on top there's a bunch of
guards and a bunch of boats. So

b471ffb0-5113-42f7-8ed6-593b5180cf6a-3
00:58:38.391 --> 00:58:41.602
I said look at closer at the
map, they're pointing to 1

b471ffb0-5113-42f7-8ed6-593b5180cf6a-4
00:58:41.602 --> 00:58:43.610
circle and it has a picture in
it.

f63efe58-48be-4bb5-8eaf-b6012ba47e9c-0
00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.970
maybe it's telling them how to
find the king.

a79f6e3a-2300-44c4-9ebf-422808a16bbc-0
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.753
but they are still on the rock,
and they're watching for the

a79f6e3a-2300-44c4-9ebf-422808a16bbc-1
00:58:56.753 --> 00:59:00.263
guards. Looks like the guards in
the boats might have spotted

a79f6e3a-2300-44c4-9ebf-422808a16bbc-2
00:59:00.263 --> 00:59:03.603
them, but they see one is
colored in the King's color with

a79f6e3a-2300-44c4-9ebf-422808a16bbc-3
00:59:03.603 --> 00:59:06.887
a cage and the and and the one
guard is a coloring of the

a79f6e3a-2300-44c4-9ebf-422808a16bbc-4
00:59:06.887 --> 00:59:07.850
King's color too.

de01ce17-6d6b-4c09-9844-9187b01c513b-0
00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:14.067
then the rock and they go with
their true crayons and they're

de01ce17-6d6b-4c09-9844-9187b01c513b-1
00:59:14.067 --> 00:59:18.762
starting to color, he's drawing,
it looks like a ball and oh, it

de01ce17-6d6b-4c09-9844-9187b01c513b-2
00:59:18.762 --> 00:59:22.806
might be a a breathing helmet
drawing flippers and he's

de01ce17-6d6b-4c09-9844-9187b01c513b-3
00:59:22.806 --> 00:59:25.839
throwing some kind of sea
looking urchin.

6e0eb75c-038a-4556-8ded-34eaad765c86-0
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.417
Ohh now they're under the water.
Oh it's like an octopus. And

6e0eb75c-038a-4556-8ded-34eaad765c86-1
00:59:36.417 --> 00:59:39.555
they're holding on to the
octopus and it's taking him down

6e0eb75c-038a-4556-8ded-34eaad765c86-2
00:59:39.555 --> 00:59:42.692
beneath the sea there. Yeah, she
gets what it was. She was

6e0eb75c-038a-4556-8ded-34eaad765c86-3
00:59:42.692 --> 00:59:45.990
drawing little sea helmets oh
she even drew one for the bird.

14107337-b10f-4db8-bb6a-daf09a0ddfbc-0
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:50.543
And we got little flippers, and
they're going down below the sea

14107337-b10f-4db8-bb6a-daf09a0ddfbc-1
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:51.650
to a city down below.

09d64146-4e26-4a89-9840-6f1c5688997e-0
00:59:56.790 --> 01:00:01.688
Then they find a a it looks like
kind of a water fountain and

09d64146-4e26-4a89-9840-6f1c5688997e-1
01:00:01.688 --> 01:00:03.900
seahorses made of seahorses.

f8168e89-908b-46ca-b912-ab34b21199ff-0
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.139
It looks magical, and she's got
these magic yellow kings and

f8168e89-908b-46ca-b912-ab34b21199ff-1
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:10.750
magic yellow crayon there.

d72b4e31-81aa-49c6-a1d4-66e1c00b64a7-0
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.661
Actually, what he's doing. Then
all of a sudden the guards are

d72b4e31-81aa-49c6-a1d4-66e1c00b64a7-1
01:00:15.661 --> 01:00:19.186
coming under the water after
them, they're chasing them, so

d72b4e31-81aa-49c6-a1d4-66e1c00b64a7-2
01:00:19.186 --> 01:00:20.420
they're running away.

3044f97c-40b6-42b6-aa1a-217829865430-0
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.250
Let me go away.

712071b1-74dd-46f6-82b8-fddce7010fb8-0
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.424
They swam to an island, they're
running up onto the island

712071b1-74dd-46f6-82b8-fddce7010fb8-1
01:00:30.424 --> 01:00:33.713
really fast. They got to kick
off the flippers and run away

712071b1-74dd-46f6-82b8-fddce7010fb8-2
01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:34.700
from these guards.

59522488-3319-45c0-825f-7c7831853f0c-0
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.890
Now they're drawing another
picture.

a8617153-82e5-4e50-89bd-a19abb85875c-0
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.407
This purple crayon and she's
drawing a little square on top

a8617153-82e5-4e50-89bd-a19abb85875c-1
01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:44.810
of whatever he's drawing.

59f2a813-0b97-48d5-81e0-3cb26eef1978-0
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.970
It's an elephant with those
elephant carrier on top.

6ab0daef-7a84-420c-aa43-d50bf5e4599a-0
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:55.130
not an elephant, that's a
rhinoceros.

53859b0d-1dbf-45db-9ea5-3cfb5f4ed189-0
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.830

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.010
That's going down the road.

9f7863d9-8862-4339-ad37-ca26bd56237a-0
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.253
To these ancient statues going
over to another building and it

9f7863d9-8862-4339-ad37-ca26bd56237a-1
01:01:06.253 --> 01:01:10.952
was like they're on a beautiful
island with lots of buildings on

9f7863d9-8862-4339-ad37-ca26bd56237a-2
01:01:10.952 --> 01:01:12.470
it, lots of greenery.

638a57f8-c9c1-4b87-b725-1e85131ec63f-0
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.387
Ohh, and it's one of those
little rope suspension bridges

638a57f8-c9c1-4b87-b725-1e85131ec63f-1
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:26.264
never are always kind of scary
to go across because they move

638a57f8-c9c1-4b87-b725-1e85131ec63f-2
01:01:26.264 --> 01:01:30.204
shaky. This one looks like it's
pretty worn out running across

638a57f8-c9c1-4b87-b725-1e85131ec63f-3
01:01:30.204 --> 01:01:34.270
this bridge to get to the other
side of the building over there.

e9d44cf0-b149-45b1-a6ce-fadb9190a288-0
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.350
They made it across. That's
good. But the soldiers are

e9d44cf0-b149-45b1-a6ce-fadb9190a288-1
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:47.632
coming right after them, and now
they're standing on top of a

e9d44cf0-b149-45b1-a6ce-fadb9190a288-2
01:01:47.632 --> 01:01:50.489
tower and watching the soldiers
come fast after them.

cbc3ac74-8455-453f-826d-ea53f68c1308-0
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:55.520
The girl is drawing a box
looking thing and the boy is

cbc3ac74-8455-453f-826d-ea53f68c1308-1
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.720
drawing huge large Oval circles.

88d55625-12a8-4469-86fc-567487d9abbe-0
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.110
Ohh, it's a swing. She drew a
swing and he drew a big.

e77e7fda-e86b-4d10-b003-20b8b1b4cd3c-0
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:12.184
Gotta get them being like a
Caterpillar, not Caterpillar.

e77e7fda-e86b-4d10-b003-20b8b1b4cd3c-1
01:02:12.184 --> 01:02:15.340
Grasshopper type looking thing
flying them away.

e3aa98ce-c290-479d-8bf6-26f2dcbcd119-0
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.469
Soldiers can't quite reach them.
They try, but they can't get

e3aa98ce-c290-479d-8bf6-26f2dcbcd119-1
01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.900
them because they're flying
away.

24d65624-f82b-48f5-8b78-2a8b91b815cb-0
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.260
They land on top of another
statue.

4fcd01d6-8302-4fbe-8be9-4f1c5582ab03-0
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.538
They're both on top of there,
but now ohh, here comes the

4fcd01d6-8302-4fbe-8be9-4f1c5582ab03-1
01:02:31.538 --> 01:02:34.590
soldiers. They got air air
machines flying after them.

1c25e528-37b7-4d66-b93f-7f3abdd38e23-0
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.097
And now she has several colors.
She has purple and green and

1c25e528-37b7-4d66-b93f-7f3abdd38e23-1
01:02:40.097 --> 01:02:41.870
yellow and orange and red.

4e6a78eb-774e-4a0d-bedf-77364a332370-0
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.986
she is looking at all of them
and they're on top of the tower

4e6a78eb-774e-4a0d-bedf-77364a332370-1
01:02:45.986 --> 01:02:48.500
and he's looking at them too and
he's still got his little.

e7923e02-57bf-49d4-ae03-68c2757c4f97-0
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.400
Circular map that the king gave
them.

82e62755-93df-4f6d-9b56-c2434d8b2da0-0
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.590
Ohh, here come the soldiers
trying to grab the thing from

82e62755-93df-4f6d-9b56-c2434d8b2da0-1
01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:03.070
the bird.

f3875a18-b2cd-48b7-ab49-06ad6641b050-0
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:08.916
The kids are on top of the tower
still, and they got the cage.

f3875a18-b2cd-48b7-ab49-06ad6641b050-1
01:03:08.916 --> 01:03:12.966
Are they going to try to catch
the bird in the cage? Oh no, not

f3875a18-b2cd-48b7-ab49-06ad6641b050-2
01:03:12.966 --> 01:03:16.763
again. And all a bunch of the
soldiers around flying closer

f3875a18-b2cd-48b7-ab49-06ad6641b050-3
01:03:16.763 --> 01:03:17.460
and closer.

32d65a9e-56c9-4e83-ae8e-760e0061cc20-0
01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.670
Ohh, she made a rainbow.

a396c12d-8475-4f93-9802-60bd75943ef6-0
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:28.879
she made a beautiful rainbow
with all the different colors

a396c12d-8475-4f93-9802-60bd75943ef6-1
01:03:28.879 --> 01:03:32.692
and the bird is carrying them.
Her belt held all the colors

a396c12d-8475-4f93-9802-60bd75943ef6-2
01:03:32.692 --> 01:03:34.979
across the sky. It looks so
pretty.

57623dcb-6316-4563-a040-ff85a4b7da00-0
01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:39.300
These planes can't catch them
that the the soldiers are all

57623dcb-6316-4563-a040-ff85a4b7da00-1
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.150
falling out of their air
machines.

a97e8c30-81ab-4414-b63a-22f8b9b9b801-0
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.082
yay and the rainbow goes right
into the boat where the king was

a97e8c30-81ab-4414-b63a-22f8b9b9b801-1
01:03:51.082 --> 01:03:54.921
where they captured the king and
the soldiers are all getting

a97e8c30-81ab-4414-b63a-22f8b9b9b801-2
01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:58.574
knocked off the boat, so they
saved the king again. That's

a97e8c30-81ab-4414-b63a-22f8b9b9b801-3
01:03:58.574 --> 01:03:59.070
awesome.

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-0
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:04.790
Beautiful colors, yeah. Not a
city is all lit up, but the

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-1
01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:08.741
rainbow colors that they put
across the sky. Everyone is

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-2
01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:12.831
happy again. Everybody is
celebrating and and they're in a

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-3
01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:17.407
boat and they're on their purple
rhinoceros carrying them and the

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-4
01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:21.635
kings with them on top of their
rhinoceros waving to all the

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-5
01:04:21.635 --> 01:04:25.933
people and in pieces there's
peace again and all the soldiers

70cfd557-d30b-44a0-8347-7171a4c6bd7a-6
01:04:25.933 --> 01:04:28.360
they've destroyed. Yeah, for
them.

ebd0f866-3791-4b4c-ab43-5c84d04cbaea-0
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:35.457
Now they're getting off that
rhinoceros and the King's

ebd0f866-3791-4b4c-ab43-5c84d04cbaea-1
01:04:35.457 --> 01:04:39.363
helping the little girl down,
coming down by the little

ebd0f866-3791-4b4c-ab43-5c84d04cbaea-2
01:04:39.363 --> 01:04:40.480
waterfall again.

1f9f3d0b-f6eb-474d-909e-682116029847-0
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.190
they are standing by

58bcc25d-9ed4-49d3-8be0-25c9a229c2c7-0
01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:49.554
An opening in the rock and the
King is drawing something for

58bcc25d-9ed4-49d3-8be0-25c9a229c2c7-1
01:04:49.554 --> 01:04:53.176
him before they leave. He's
drawing a crown for both of

58bcc25d-9ed4-49d3-8be0-25c9a229c2c7-2
01:04:53.176 --> 01:04:56.410
them. He's crowning both of them
for her bravery.

b044d9b7-6ba8-46a0-bf98-182141dafc83-0
01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:00.470
And then they're waving goodbye
to the king and he's saying

b044d9b7-6ba8-46a0-bf98-182141dafc83-1
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:01.400
thank you so much.

The two of them are back in the
tunnel, and what do they see? A

rainbow in the sky.

#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
Dinosaurs, spacemen and ghouls,

511d865c-5878-41c3-ab09-5fdd0de1d6c5-1
01:05:29.798 --> 01:05:33.720
Pew, incredible time, space and
horror are all in mighty middle

511d865c-5878-41c3-ab09-5fdd0de1d6c5-2
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.458
here. But cosmic costumes and
what great special effects one

511d865c-5878-41c3-ab09-5fdd0de1d6c5-3
01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:41.135
of those flying saucers looks
like. It's really flying. Are

511d865c-5878-41c3-ab09-5fdd0de1d6c5-4
01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:44.812
those real aliens inside? Not
actors at all. So what's real

511d865c-5878-41c3-ab09-5fdd0de1d6c5-5
01:05:44.812 --> 01:05:48.673
and what's made-up in the films
like these? Well, let's take a

511d865c-5878-41c3-ab09-5fdd0de1d6c5-6
01:05:48.673 --> 01:05:48.980
look.

e9fb24fd-d8e2-4b0f-8112-092fed1b8dff-0
01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.158
Start off with the that that
writing was on a big movie

e9fb24fd-d8e2-4b0f-8112-092fed1b8dff-1
01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:56.260
clipboard where they say action.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.857
Then there's little dinosaurs
are in the background, and

da5134f2-a56f-4c57-b79e-d5b40d7c9304-1
01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:03.390
there's a caveman fighting the
dinosaurs off.

058c837e-a23a-49e1-96d7-b058186032d1-0
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:08.614
Then there's some caveman on top
of a volcano, and the volcanoes

058c837e-a23a-49e1-96d7-b058186032d1-1
01:06:08.614 --> 01:06:12.747
erupting then, and so they're
getting a little bottoms burned,

058c837e-a23a-49e1-96d7-b058186032d1-2
01:06:12.747 --> 01:06:16.552
smaller eruptions right down
below it, and then there's a

058c837e-a23a-49e1-96d7-b058186032d1-3
01:06:16.552 --> 01:06:20.225
sleeping dragon, and the
dinosaur is about ready to pop

058c837e-a23a-49e1-96d7-b058186032d1-4
01:06:20.225 --> 01:06:24.161
them on the head. And then this
other one, dinosaurs on his

058c837e-a23a-49e1-96d7-b058186032d1-5
01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:27.770
back, and they're tickling him
and he's laughing away.

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.290
dinosaur is making faces at at
them.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.390

making faces at him.

01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:41.200
This other dinosaur is dreaming
of dinosaurs and and.

e50f6c48-d48f-4394-bbdb-a64014830dfe-0
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:46.234
And dinosaur girlfriend. Ohh,
he's dreaming of dinosaurs and

e50f6c48-d48f-4394-bbdb-a64014830dfe-1
01:06:46.234 --> 01:06:46.720

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.446
The caveman's drinking, well,
some are dreaming of dinosaurs

e3b3110c-70b2-4c2a-88b0-fcb918761afa-1
01:06:50.446 --> 01:06:52.330
and some are dreaming of pretty
women.

b3af8cee-f8a2-4e03-97f6-87678f2a65cb-0
01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:59.577
And this one dinosaur, and he's
letting them write all over him,

b3af8cee-f8a2-4e03-97f6-87678f2a65cb-1
01:06:59.577 --> 01:07:03.380
and they're drawing airplanes
and cars all over our dinosaur.

b3af8cee-f8a2-4e03-97f6-87678f2a65cb-2
01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:07.429
And there's a blue dinosaur, and
then there's a red dinosaur. But

b3af8cee-f8a2-4e03-97f6-87678f2a65cb-3
01:07:07.429 --> 01:07:11.110
the Red Dinosaur isn't really
real because there's an actor

b3af8cee-f8a2-4e03-97f6-87678f2a65cb-4
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.913
inside of it. So he has a fake
head. He just took off. How do

b3af8cee-f8a2-4e03-97f6-87678f2a65cb-5
01:07:14.913 --> 01:07:18.900

sky, and then you have aliens
and space saucers. Are they real

dcdabf25-078a-45da-89a3-5e57554c91c4-2
01:08:21.174 --> 01:08:25.481

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.435
And it was like they're just
floating around because they got

b847aa0c-613e-48c4-88b2-12175f659c0d-1
01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:34.357
them all hanging by strings

b847aa0c-613e-48c4-88b2-12175f659c0d-2

flying.

f9954b67-6522-4c72-9899-5b9ffbb573d0-0
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:39.951
there is a guy sitting on a
flying saucer, and then there's

f9954b67-6522-4c72-9899-5b9ffbb573d0-1
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:43.921
another flying saucer full of
aliens about ready to crash, and

f9954b67-6522-4c72-9899-5b9ffbb573d0-2
01:08:43.921 --> 01:08:47.891
there's a man painting the whole
sky scene he's not quite done

f9954b67-6522-4c72-9899-5b9ffbb573d0-3
01:08:47.891 --> 01:08:51.672
before he started. And then
there's a big contraption where

f9954b67-6522-4c72-9899-5b9ffbb573d0-4
01:08:51.672 --> 01:08:53.500
all the guys have fallen out.

47a953fe-7c5e-4f09-baf4-50d899f166a7-0
01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.980
And then there's more aliens out
of their ship now.

4eafec6f-58e0-4a1b-8e14-141140efdcc2-0
01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:05.225
And the aliens and the and the
and the people are actually

4eafec6f-58e0-4a1b-8e14-141140efdcc2-1
01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:09.582
talking and they're filming it.
There's a cameraman filming all

4eafec6f-58e0-4a1b-8e14-141140efdcc2-2
01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:13.938
this commotion going on at the
boom microphone so they can hear

4eafec6f-58e0-4a1b-8e14-141140efdcc2-3
01:09:13.938 --> 01:09:15.300
what they're saying.

4d87d353-18b3-4575-a329-b6cd663e2e3f-0
01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.819
And then there's more lights,
more camera lights, and you go

4d87d353-18b3-4575-a329-b6cd663e2e3f-1
01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:26.135
down below and that's the other
half of the film. There's

4d87d353-18b3-4575-a329-b6cd663e2e3f-2
01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:30.674
they're filming over here with a
scary looking tree and more

4d87d353-18b3-4575-a329-b6cd663e2e3f-3
01:09:30.674 --> 01:09:31.269
zombies.

ebe284e3-94bc-495d-9916-ebab6f8c84c4-0
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:37.130
More cameras and more lights and
then they're over here and this

ebe284e3-94bc-495d-9916-ebab6f8c84c4-1
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:41.351
looks like it looks like a deli
where they can eat big pieces of

ebe284e3-94bc-495d-9916-ebab6f8c84c4-2
01:09:41.351 --> 01:09:45.442
pie on the wall, big hamburgers
on the wall because waitresses

ebe284e3-94bc-495d-9916-ebab6f8c84c4-3
01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:48.560
there and a lady bringing up the
cash register.

a0df57fa-c7d7-409e-880d-00b349fe01b7-0
01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.653
People eating pie at the table
and eating other things. And

a0df57fa-c7d7-409e-880d-00b349fe01b7-1
01:09:52.653 --> 01:09:55.987
then there's people. Aliens
they're eating too, and Dracula

a0df57fa-c7d7-409e-880d-00b349fe01b7-2
01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:59.599
is eating. They're all in their
costumes from making the movies.

a0df57fa-c7d7-409e-880d-00b349fe01b7-3
01:09:59.599 --> 01:10:03.155
They're all in like a cafeteria
line where they can go get what

a0df57fa-c7d7-409e-880d-00b349fe01b7-4
01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:04.100
they want to eat.

9813f59f-4885-4d65-9ccf-f523358b30fa-0
01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.424
There's a clown half his clown
outfit on. There's a robot and

9813f59f-4885-4d65-9ccf-f523358b30fa-1
01:10:08.424 --> 01:10:11.970
he's got his food over. It's
going to be hard for him to eat

9813f59f-4885-4d65-9ccf-f523358b30fa-2
01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:13.540
with that robot costume on.

890e43e8-f09f-4d80-823b-46ffb18fdeea-0
01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:19.400
And then there's a guy with a
looks like a werewolf head on.

52b28b98-21f3-4c2a-b51a-a5838558d6c1-0
01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.000

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.734
Giant purple blue Turkey. I
never saw blue Turkey before,

a2a8d687-9f66-4921-be64-d5346a80af07-1
01:10:27.734 --> 01:10:31.623
but I guess they like it. Just
people running around

a2a8d687-9f66-4921-be64-d5346a80af07-2
01:10:31.623 --> 01:10:32.430
everywhere.

doing makeup on on a lady.

a6939aa0-a00d-4c8c-b27e-c7032f38c69a-0

next one.}

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-0
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.345
#START_birthday_party_fun
Birthday party fun. Oh, I like

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-1
01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:54.877
birthdays. Penguins stumble upon
a birthday celebration. Amelia

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-2
01:10:54.877 --> 01:10:58.409
thinks the monkeys at the zoom
seemed calm in comparison to the

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-3
01:10:58.409 --> 01:11:01.941
kids at the party. Huge heads,
straight. Hugo head straight for

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-4
01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:05.528
the party food to nibble on the
sandwiches while Arnie stretches

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-5
01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:08.950
his wings and gets ready for a
game of tug of war. Let's look

c9776fe2-4a95-45c9-a0d6-dfcb84211b0e-6
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:10.330
and see what we got here.

761e5070-ee1f-4037-a991-7155538ebd4b-0
01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.974
First, little old the lady.
That's the neighbors looking

761e5070-ee1f-4037-a991-7155538ebd4b-1
01:11:14.974 --> 01:11:18.198
over going what's all the
commotion going on here? Because

761e5070-ee1f-4037-a991-7155538ebd4b-2
01:11:18.198 --> 01:11:20.330
there's a lot of people at this
party.

413b618b-6dd1-470e-8a93-b8dd22188de1-0
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:25.401
there is a pinata first of all,
and then the kid is blindfolded

413b618b-6dd1-470e-8a93-b8dd22188de1-1
01:11:25.401 --> 01:11:28.707
trying to hit the pinata. Those
are fun when, especially when

413b618b-6dd1-470e-8a93-b8dd22188de1-2
01:11:28.707 --> 01:11:29.560
the candy drops.

124c6343-7ddf-41ad-aebb-2247efb45cf3-0
01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:33.635
And then we go up above and the
kids are all dressed in

124c6343-7ddf-41ad-aebb-2247efb45cf3-1
01:11:33.635 --> 01:11:35.410

party.

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:40.844
And then there's dad's carrying
the cake out to the table.

5f01e009-a8cb-4670-85e8-bdc8e9e27de2-1
01:11:40.844 --> 01:11:45.181
There's a table full of all
kinds of food, cupcakes and cake

5f01e009-a8cb-4670-85e8-bdc8e9e27de2-2
01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:47.030

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:52.215
And not much healthy stuff at
that table, little boy dressed

35e464e7-bad1-4994-b5b7-05aa33507b15-1
01:11:52.215 --> 01:11:54.050
like a little pig outfit.

3178dc3e-45c7-4a7d-9b68-ed3ff0a5121f-0
01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.198

war.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.821
And I don't know who's winning.
It looks like they're pretty

641269cc-5701-4e2d-b505-6fed6820ca33-1
01:12:06.821 --> 01:12:09.874
even as a kid with a whistle
ready to blow for the to say

641269cc-5701-4e2d-b505-6fed6820ca33-2
01:12:09.874 --> 01:12:12.664
who's the winner. And then
there's the table full of

641269cc-5701-4e2d-b505-6fed6820ca33-3
01:12:12.664 --> 01:12:15.980

place. Lots of presents. That's

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:19.296
always fun, right? A birthday
party. And more people are still

641269cc-5701-4e2d-b505-6fed6820ca33-5
01:12:19.296 --> 01:12:20.559
coming in with presents.

50cd02ad-182f-47b3-8e9f-6437ef1936c0-0
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:26.319
And there's a clown there to
entertain the kids. And there's

50cd02ad-182f-47b3-8e9f-6437ef1936c0-1
01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:30.960
a swimming pool too, and they're
swimming dumping water on on the

50cd02ad-182f-47b3-8e9f-6437ef1936c0-2
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.070

pool with squirt guns which boys

9c4caac1-1423-4008-83c2-e07a286ad48c-1
01:12:38.139 --> 01:12:41.594

birthday party because everyone

9c4caac1-1423-4008-83c2-e07a286ad48c-2

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:48.543
And up above we have some
ghoulish looking people that

91e2bf48-2900-45ed-be33-2694c564c1f4-1
01:12:48.543 --> 01:12:51.648

Then there's a A. It looks like
it might be where the Penguins

50564397-b3bf-47db-8b9b-24e4a4dae63e-1
01:16:30.297 --> 01:16:33.800

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.718
So there's a lot of people
watching and looking. Oh,

623498b3-7daf-4804-b519-7f046ac08acd-1
01:16:43.718 --> 01:16:47.543

flamingos and a hippopotamus.
And the people are all watching

01:17:02.347 --> 01:17:07.096
And there's a Peacock all inside
the Peacock wings. Guess what's

33afad2a-c478-4a34-bc09-b090249963c6-4
01:17:07.096 --> 01:17:11.626

01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:17.816
And the kids have jumped over
the edge. I guess they want to

014ea61b-c88e-4753-9e8c-7d4daa9837ec-1
01:17:17.816 --> 01:17:21.420

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:25.631
And then there's a rhinoceros is
running through the whole crowd.

acd6640d-8f03-4e63-aad3-49c38633faa1-1
01:17:25.631 --> 01:17:28.657

scaring them. But then they
don't realize they're jumping in

acd6640d-8f03-4e63-aad3-49c38633faa1-4
01:17:34.173 --> 01:17:37.200
