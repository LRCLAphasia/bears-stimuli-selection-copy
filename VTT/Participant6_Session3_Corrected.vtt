00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.770
Remember.

e1e7e1f9-35d9-4699-a759-3ac0a09dc38a-0
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.109
OK. So as we have been doing
this time, we'll also see either

e1e7e1f9-35d9-4699-a759-3ac0a09dc38a-1
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.752
graphic novel as you can see
right now, they tell the story.

e1e7e1f9-35d9-4699-a759-3ac0a09dc38a-2
00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:17.091
So describe what you see and
what is happening as you go

e1e7e1f9-35d9-4699-a759-3ac0a09dc38a-3
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:21.810
through the story. OK. I can't
remember, am I picking up from

e1e7e1f9-35d9-4699-a759-3ac0a09dc38a-4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.834
the last time or is this a whole
new story? This should be, it's,

e1e7e1f9-35d9-4699-a759-3ac0a09dc38a-5
00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:30.639
it's a whole new, whole new
story. OK. All right.

1ed86194-1b69-41e8-b1f4-7ee492897f21-0
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.080
Oh boy. OK.

5615fd5e-9a6f-4a55-bb03-490cb94a00ff-0
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.716
#START_arrival_3 So we have kind
of like a black and white

5615fd5e-9a6f-4a55-bb03-490cb94a00ff-1
00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:49.030
charcoal type of picture scene
here there is a picture of a.

10ce0d89-e064-4e5d-865d-273975b53382-0
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.359
Young man probably like early
teens out on the streets. He's

10ce0d89-e064-4e5d-865d-273975b53382-1
00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.344
wearing black pants, black
shoes, a white shirt, black

10ce0d89-e064-4e5d-865d-273975b53382-2
00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:03.880
jacket or coat, and he's got a
hat on.

b9915c7d-4926-4a7a-890d-d1af6aaf5cca-0
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.290
And he is holding some.

09c70e27-df09-4e88-8208-9c3002801927-0
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.521
Folded papers that have some
kind of language written on

09c70e27-df09-4e88-8208-9c3002801927-1
00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:20.607
them, almost as if he might be
selling newspapers. That's what

09c70e27-df09-4e88-8208-9c3002801927-2
00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:25.290
it kind of looks like to me,
like he's a a newspaper boy.

33f71443-2cea-4273-ab9d-68ee60c8d615-0
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.590
Um, we also have a picture of a
woman kind of middle-aged.

35bd49a0-0634-4e56-8098-5b69a02c872c-0
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.202
Who is holding an animal that is
very reminiscent of a cat? It's

35bd49a0-0634-4e56-8098-5b69a02c872c-1
00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:45.186
a little bit different, but it's
it's very similar to a cat and

35bd49a0-0634-4e56-8098-5b69a02c872c-2
00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:50.092
there's she's kind of looking
off to the side. There's another

35bd49a0-0634-4e56-8098-5b69a02c872c-3
00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:55.154
woman kind of standing in front
of her, looking the opposite way

35bd49a0-0634-4e56-8098-5b69a02c872c-4
00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:56.790
we have a picture of.

f9732581-2c8c-4828-8e62-8584be1dc6fa-0
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.800
A man.

5575d5fc-23ec-4554-b66a-4941f3b9201e-0
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.390
Just Scroll down so I can.

08fd0979-7a2f-4f44-9b02-31d9ff4e9d3d-0
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.037
Maybe I can't see it. There's a
picture of a man also out on the

08fd0979-7a2f-4f44-9b02-31d9ff4e9d3d-1
00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:14.990
street, and he has a little
cart, almost kind of like a

08fd0979-7a2f-4f44-9b02-31d9ff4e9d3d-2
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.500
little hot dog vendor, like a
little hot dog cart.

c67f9dd4-f2f6-4e7d-9bfd-7389f00d3289-0
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320
It has.

98c98a6a-8f9d-4cf5-8933-b5a5b2985d11-0
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.419
It has some kind of there's a
little basket on the other side

98c98a6a-8f9d-4cf5-8933-b5a5b2985d11-1
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:33.467
where there's an animal that's
kind of sitting in the basket

98c98a6a-8f9d-4cf5-8933-b5a5b2985d11-2
00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:34.460
peering out.

84d67349-dfb7-4d82-a7c7-5276f80a7003-0
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.910
And I'm not even sure what kind
of an animal that resembles um.

c24666f4-8af5-403f-ac60-2719dd30eb11-0
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.835
But he's he's kind of smaller in
size, dark. He's got little

c24666f4-8af5-403f-ac60-2719dd30eb11-1
00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:48.890
spikes that begin on the top of
his head and go down his back.

917d5f0a-72b6-45f2-b50a-67da59607677-0
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.168
Maybe kind of like a squirrel
but with spikes and then on the

917d5f0a-72b6-45f2-b50a-67da59607677-1
00:02:54.168 --> 00:02:55.850
cart there appears to be.

c56ac525-9bd2-4af6-9d74-eb8bed44a6e9-0
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.604
Like maybe a tea or coffee urn
of some sort. Like a like a

c56ac525-9bd2-4af6-9d74-eb8bed44a6e9-1
00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:07.100
kettle or an urn. And there's a
center part.

8d8ccc26-7341-4d22-9608-f782b0c65788-0
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.237
That is tall, that sticks out.
And it looks like there's steam

8d8ccc26-7341-4d22-9608-f782b0c65788-1
00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:16.475
coming from that, so I would
imagine that that cart has some

8d8ccc26-7341-4d22-9608-f782b0c65788-2
00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:17.170
kind of a.

9124ff7e-d449-4315-a26c-ee8701fdf099-0
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.574
A heating system for to keep
warm whatever is stored in the

9124ff7e-d449-4315-a26c-ee8701fdf099-1
00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:28.444
cart and served, and then
there's a little pop up on the

9124ff7e-d449-4315-a26c-ee8701fdf099-2
00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:32.790
other side where the top of the
cart kind of lifts up a little.

93e81e12-f1a3-407d-a3e9-92383953a30a-0
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.390
Uh.

cec93aaa-0c38-47c0-96c9-1c6f0174aacb-0
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.298
Section in the man is reaching
into the cart, but I can't quite

cec93aaa-0c38-47c0-96c9-1c6f0174aacb-1
00:03:40.298 --> 00:03:45.391
tell what is inside of the cart.
And then in the last picture

cec93aaa-0c38-47c0-96c9-1c6f0174aacb-2
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.610
there is a man and a woman.

c02556f8-4772-4592-b554-d767a2dd5983-0
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.110


2e0077b3-0d7d-4e08-8bc9-c1fcd7063905-0
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.060
They are holding like very large
eggs.

7cbe77d2-e101-4169-90b1-c24c9015c2c0-0
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.006
And there's a crate, like like a
wooden crate that the eggs are

7cbe77d2-e101-4169-90b1-c24c9015c2c0-1
00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:06.822
in. The man is holding one egg
in his arm. The woman is picking

7cbe77d2-e101-4169-90b1-c24c9015c2c0-2
00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:11.487
up an egg in her arms, and then
there's two more eggs left in

7cbe77d2-e101-4169-90b1-c24c9015c2c0-3
00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:12.240
the crate.

4fbe81ec-8567-4e32-8624-46c055ab4b31-0
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.540
Then we move to the next page
and we see.

dfebbd35-c34c-48d0-8416-87f8f4f9fe23-0
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.290
We see a young boy.

bb36fd60-24b3-4486-a79a-300720bc3033-0
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.640
And.

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-0
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.977
I would say probably a man may
potentially his father, maybe

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-1
00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:34.691
the dad. The boy is standing
behind a chair and the dad is in

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-2
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.328
the chair, as if it looks like
they're at a Barber shop. The

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-3
00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:44.042
dad has a white cloth draped
over his shoulders and his front

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-4
00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:48.679
side kind of to protect him.
Kind of like you would get like

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-5
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:53.697
if you're at the salon or you're
getting you're at the barbershop

f3fe7672-cd4e-4631-b3ac-eabaf39e25f4-6
00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:55.750
when you get your hair cut.

1bbe692f-3977-4e2e-8852-dc621ec78b3d-0
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.710
And the dad has.

de3d69fe-df8a-4e25-9266-6042a5866eba-0
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.088
I all three of them have hats
on. The little boy and the dad

de3d69fe-df8a-4e25-9266-6042a5866eba-1
00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:10.942
have like kind of cone shaped
hats and he has shaving cream on

de3d69fe-df8a-4e25-9266-6042a5866eba-2
00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:16.889
his cheeks and his chin and he's
got his head tilted back while

e4073ee0-aad3-4df4-9312-09e973d61c0e-0
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.310
The work the man who works there
is got like a.

12b8ef50-58b1-4266-9b52-ce27c8a823b0-0
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.001
A straight razor and he's
appears to be shaving him. The

12b8ef50-58b1-4266-9b52-ce27c8a823b0-1
00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:34.354
man that works there is wearing
like more of a white pillbox

12b8ef50-58b1-4266-9b52-ce27c8a823b0-2
00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:39.355
style hat. He's got on a long
white sleeve, long kind of

12b8ef50-58b1-4266-9b52-ce27c8a823b0-3
00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:44.796
buttoned down shirt and white
slacks. And the boy has on like

12b8ef50-58b1-4266-9b52-ce27c8a823b0-4
00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:49.622
a dark colored jacket and
slacks. And there are little

12b8ef50-58b1-4266-9b52-ce27c8a823b0-5
00:05:49.622 --> 00:05:54.010
there's little snails that have
like little feet.

a4c1167f-f6a1-4112-b9b8-67fafa2b601b-0
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.426
Underneath of them, so they are
able to walk on feet and they

a4c1167f-f6a1-4112-b9b8-67fafa2b601b-1
00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:03.800
are kind of on the ground
surrounding these three.

6e6ca386-bb87-4b68-aec9-bf111592a610-0
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.660
Very odd, OK.

881cce2e-7842-469f-a43e-b3a462e3a872-0
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.440
In the next picture we have.

60f9d8ef-9556-4f6d-a0b4-9d0c7b02c766-0
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.411
A man who is sitting down
wearing a very long dark kind of

60f9d8ef-9556-4f6d-a0b4-9d0c7b02c766-1
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:24.604
like trench coat, overcoat type
of a coat. He's also got a looks

60f9d8ef-9556-4f6d-a0b4-9d0c7b02c766-2
00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:29.845
like maybe dress shoes. They
look a little shiny. He's

60f9d8ef-9556-4f6d-a0b4-9d0c7b02c766-3
00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:35.562
wearing black slacks and maybe

60f9d8ef-9556-4f6d-a0b4-9d0c7b02c766-4
00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:41.469
like a top hat type of a hat.
And he is playing an instrument

60f9d8ef-9556-4f6d-a0b4-9d0c7b02c766-5
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:43.280
that is similar to.

086cd22d-6f72-4713-93ab-35b53833e1bc-0
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.994
Like an accordion, because he's
got his hands one hand on each

086cd22d-6f72-4713-93ab-35b53833e1bc-1
00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:54.420
side. But in this on the front
center part of the accordion,

086cd22d-6f72-4713-93ab-35b53833e1bc-2
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.890
there is another piece that
comes out.

bac5afca-21d7-4857-9509-5e62aff99db9-0
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.280
That is.

0cf1999f-1ee7-490f-a7b9-3780072f1fc0-0
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.180
Uh, I don't know. Kind of like a

00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:15.423
that sticks out but it's it's
longer than a trumpet almost

d692d9cb-3fb5-464a-a47a-00ec1879754e-2
00:07:15.423 --> 00:07:16.939
kind of like maybe a.

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-0
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.697
Well, I don't know. I don't
know. It's like it's a mixture

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-1
00:07:22.697 --> 00:07:26.713
of like an accordion or some
kind of brass trumpet, tuba

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-2
00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:30.658
clarinet type of, well,
clarinets win, but some kind of

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-3
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:34.463
metal piece and they're
connected. And he has a music

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-4
00:07:34.463 --> 00:07:38.973
stand in front of him that he's
looking at and there appears to

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-5
00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:43.553
be a music book or some kind of
sheet music in front of him. And

42f4ae47-628e-451b-a6ff-77c5af82bc9b-6
00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:46.160
then off to his side is another
man.

4d613b51-e864-41db-bfd8-746dd36ea81a-0
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.515
Also wearing all black with
dress shoes and a hat, and he is

4d613b51-e864-41db-bfd8-746dd36ea81a-1
00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:56.315
playing something very similar
to a violin. And they're sitting

4d613b51-e864-41db-bfd8-746dd36ea81a-2
00:07:56.315 --> 00:08:00.665
outside on the street. There's
some brick behind them, so

4d613b51-e864-41db-bfd8-746dd36ea81a-3
00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:05.465
they're in front of some kind of
a brick building and there are

4d613b51-e864-41db-bfd8-746dd36ea81a-4
00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:10.190
little birds that are down on
the ground at their feet kind of

4d613b51-e864-41db-bfd8-746dd36ea81a-5
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.390
all around them.

c31d336a-e4e2-41df-9a74-03cd717d8816-0
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.000
In the next picture we see.

96d231e6-911a-485d-bcb0-6a116c235e41-0
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.560
There's.

989762c7-f23d-469b-824d-2dcfac0634cf-0
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.482
Three women that are kind of
sitting next to one another and

989762c7-f23d-469b-824d-2dcfac0634cf-1
00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:31.708
then off kind of to their side
is a row of another two women.

989762c7-f23d-469b-824d-2dcfac0634cf-2
00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:37.272
They're sitting in front of some
kind of brick wall, but the wall

989762c7-f23d-469b-824d-2dcfac0634cf-3
00:08:37.272 --> 00:08:38.789
has writing on it.

5b6ed898-0002-4cbc-91bc-ee0e20f04e43-0
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.200
Like etched into the brick.

3e8d6116-2397-47aa-99be-607462034392-0
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.389
And I can't tell what language
it is, but it's it's some kind

3e8d6116-2397-47aa-99be-607462034392-1
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:51.595
of a language. Uh. And then in
front of these three women is a

3e8d6116-2397-47aa-99be-607462034392-2
00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.400
pot that you can see steam
coming out of.

ebe65a38-dc5b-4979-87ae-8f1ef9c54df0-0
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.843
Uh, that's kind of on the
ground. They're sitting there.

ebe65a38-dc5b-4979-87ae-8f1ef9c54df0-1
00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:05.081
The one woman all the way to the
right is holding open some kind

ebe65a38-dc5b-4979-87ae-8f1ef9c54df0-2
00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:09.835
of a book or paper, and the
woman next to her is knitting.

ebe65a38-dc5b-4979-87ae-8f1ef9c54df0-3
00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:10.480
She has.

b555be60-ec4c-4ae9-8ac7-3dc8118ae0eb-0
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.903
Something that she's knitting in
her lap. And then the third

b555be60-ec4c-4ae9-8ac7-3dc8118ae0eb-1
00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:20.821
woman has some kind of an
animal. It's appears like it's

b555be60-ec4c-4ae9-8ac7-3dc8118ae0eb-2
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:24.877
got tall, it's white with tall
pointy ears, kind of like a

b555be60-ec4c-4ae9-8ac7-3dc8118ae0eb-3
00:09:24.877 --> 00:09:29.345
Bunny rabbit. And she's kind of
holding that on the lap. And the

b555be60-ec4c-4ae9-8ac7-3dc8118ae0eb-4
00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:32.920
woman with the Bunny rabbit and
the woman with the.

a82f8922-85a6-40d5-90c0-f13080214a47-0
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:41.555
Knitting materials are both
looking over to the woman who

a82f8922-85a6-40d5-90c0-f13080214a47-1
00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:44.210
has this book or these.

5d7fb6b7-b8b6-48f3-94b4-f50e20361250-0
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.270
But I guess it's a book in her
lap.

4f659b8b-825a-40d4-9900-b128be1b932f-0
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.825
And they're kind of looking
over, down at her hands towards

4f659b8b-825a-40d4-9900-b128be1b932f-1
00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:54.560
the book.

26bc675e-3893-48da-8719-4fb68e4afe60-0
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:02.121
In the last picture we see again
a street scene with a man

26bc675e-3893-48da-8719-4fb68e4afe60-1
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:08.416
standing kind of just inside,
just into the road. Just off of

26bc675e-3893-48da-8719-4fb68e4afe60-2
00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:11.260
the sidewalk. Behind him is.

55e931b8-df98-45f2-9b5e-7ad024bcbe93-0
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.100
A man and.

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-0
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.181
Possibly a little boy, a little
boy or a little girl. Definitely

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-1
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:25.232
looks like a younger person. And
there's also a man on a bicycle

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-2
00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:30.129
behind him. But this particular
man is standing in the street.

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-3
00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:34.714
He's holding a suitcase in his
left hand. He's got on dark

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-4
00:10:34.714 --> 00:10:39.454
slacks, looks like maybe like a
a vest of some sort, a white

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-5
00:10:39.454 --> 00:10:43.729
collared shirt and then a
jacket. And he also has on a

977d842d-54ce-47be-b540-1b01c1a2ba98-6
00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:44.040
hat.

7057b6c3-c28f-40ea-838a-b07a5d2c911a-0
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.574
And he is. He's got his right
hand up to his chin and he's

7057b6c3-c28f-40ea-838a-b07a5d2c911a-1
00:10:49.574 --> 00:10:51.560
looking off to his right.

e366b45c-5906-4435-b861-b1a3b59802be-0
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:03.672
Then we see a picture of the man
who was holding this suitcase

e366b45c-5906-4435-b861-b1a3b59802be-1
00:11:03.672 --> 00:11:09.591
and he opens up he's got a
pocket watch that he opens up

e366b45c-5906-4435-b861-b1a3b59802be-2
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:15.717
and he pulls out the pocket
watch and he looks at the time

e366b45c-5906-4435-b861-b1a3b59802be-3
00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.210
and then he looks up at.

9d47a59e-e504-4db2-a6b1-d4ef89447869-0
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.595
What appears to be a building
can't tell if it's a church or

9d47a59e-e504-4db2-a6b1-d4ef89447869-1
00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:26.190
some kind of a building that
has.

b5a28c94-8621-4049-8cd1-76917fc5b830-0
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.170
A round circular.

c82ea3f8-cd6c-4fdf-951f-8790386c5fba-0
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.000
Clock.

4adacaae-5964-449c-a7e7-96e5c3c5fa19-0
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.023
On the front of it. But the
clock does not have hands, it's

4adacaae-5964-449c-a7e7-96e5c3c5fa19-1
00:11:37.023 --> 00:11:37.580
more of.

3fef0d30-bb01-46c7-87db-99b2efd48fb2-0
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.340
Looks like some kind of like a
mechanical.

db9ca3e2-1381-461a-8c63-efd336724723-0
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.046
Type of clock, like you might
see on a watch, but it doesn't

db9ca3e2-1381-461a-8c63-efd336724723-1
00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:49.762
have numbers or hands. It's more
like the mechanical parts. I

db9ca3e2-1381-461a-8c63-efd336724723-2
00:11:49.762 --> 00:11:52.580
don't. I don't know how else to
describe that.

507902cb-d334-4fba-bb4a-f37116ef2e94-0
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.245
Then we see the man walking
across the street. He's still

507902cb-d334-4fba-bb4a-f37116ef2e94-1
00:11:57.245 --> 00:12:00.889
holding his luggage, he's got
his luggage in his right hand.

507902cb-d334-4fba-bb4a-f37116ef2e94-2
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:04.474
He's crossing. There's other
people crossing the street and

507902cb-d334-4fba-bb4a-f37116ef2e94-3
00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.430
he crosses over.

304aa6a9-b513-43a6-ba8c-f2c11bb0d5d1-0
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:12.737
And he is. He's walking down the
sidewalk. There's a man behind

304aa6a9-b513-43a6-ba8c-f2c11bb0d5d1-1
00:12:12.737 --> 00:12:18.170
him sitting on the curb with
maybe reading something.

47a9e17a-3642-484d-95d6-802617c9b34c-0
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.406
He proceeds to walk further down
the the street. He's now passing

47a9e17a-3642-484d-95d6-802617c9b34c-1
00:12:24.406 --> 00:12:28.802
a building that has some arched
doorways on it, and it looks

47a9e17a-3642-484d-95d6-802617c9b34c-2
00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:30.460
like maybe a string of.

ac89e138-1a57-4880-a80d-b216d3f64c11-0
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.540
Looks like there's lights.

d6bc7915-ca6a-442e-93c9-3819b2eea10e-0
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.870
Maybe it was a string of lights,
but now it looks like they're

d6bc7915-ca6a-442e-93c9-3819b2eea10e-1
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.010
just like little floating.

e7b6d31c-deb0-4fac-aeab-2f5d443ed04c-0
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.490
Lights almost kind of like you
would see stars in the sky.

cf3492c3-5d10-4c3a-85ee-dac802bee6b5-0
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.950
The man looks up and he sees
these lights.

4c1fb72a-fab9-46df-83cf-c8ea7001d6fa-0
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.960
And it looks like he tries to
touch one of the lights, the

4c1fb72a-fab9-46df-83cf-c8ea7001d6fa-1
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.511
floating lights. They're just
around little circles of light.

4c1fb72a-fab9-46df-83cf-c8ea7001d6fa-2
00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:01.420
And when he does, his hat.

db3bfc99-c3ef-4d46-bacb-8ceba5f1f1c4-0
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.470
Comes off of his head, kind of
like blows off of his head.

19fb03ed-489b-489b-9af1-85bbaf8d7f1f-0
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:15.359
And he reaches down to pick up
the hat and place it back on his

19fb03ed-489b-489b-9af1-85bbaf8d7f1f-1
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:15.880
head.

1369bc27-e35a-42af-965b-e328a238f404-0
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.858
And he realizes that the hat
fell on this some sort of a map.

1369bc27-e35a-42af-965b-e328a238f404-1
00:13:21.858 --> 00:13:26.759
It looks like a map. It's got
letters and words. It's got

1369bc27-e35a-42af-965b-e328a238f404-2
00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:31.829
arrows in different directions.
It's got some circles. So I

1369bc27-e35a-42af-965b-e328a238f404-3
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:37.322
don't know if it's a street map
or what, but it's some kind of a

1369bc27-e35a-42af-965b-e328a238f404-4
00:13:37.322 --> 00:13:37.660
map.

3ace829e-faec-448a-bdf1-3df6c6f2f098-0
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.488
And the man leans down. He says
his luggage down. He leans down

3ace829e-faec-448a-bdf1-3df6c6f2f098-1
00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:45.160
and he pulls out a book.

9c633f4b-a564-4095-b5db-493348aaca41-0
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.228
Um, that's got writing on it.
And he's reading a page in the

9c633f4b-a564-4095-b5db-493348aaca41-1
00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:56.628
book when another man comes up
kind of behind him and over his

9c633f4b-a564-4095-b5db-493348aaca41-2
00:13:56.628 --> 00:14:02.114
shoulder, and reaches his hand
out towards the man, and the man

9c633f4b-a564-4095-b5db-493348aaca41-3
00:14:02.114 --> 00:14:06.400
looks up to the second man
reaching his hand out.

1d77b31a-00b7-4a15-a3a3-dfb00e36223a-0
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.780
Umm.

8ae79973-241e-45ce-ac30-cacee8f51712-0
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:18.130
The so the two of them the man
obviously stands up and.

ade46172-e6a2-4ec7-ae70-b4c1f32c1286-0
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.236
Begins a conversation with this
other man. This particular man

ade46172-e6a2-4ec7-ae70-b4c1f32c1286-1
00:14:23.236 --> 00:14:27.091
is dressed in all white. He's
got like on a white, like a

ade46172-e6a2-4ec7-ae70-b4c1f32c1286-2
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:30.680
short collared shirt that
buttoned down partially. It

ade46172-e6a2-4ec7-ae70-b4c1f32c1286-3
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.066
looks like he's got some kind of
beaded necklace around his neck.

ade46172-e6a2-4ec7-ae70-b4c1f32c1286-4
00:14:35.066 --> 00:14:37.060
He's also got on like a white.

3496aff6-15db-4dad-9f24-1e6385948ec1-0
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.433
Pillbox style hat, but it does
have some fabric that hangs down

3496aff6-15db-4dad-9f24-1e6385948ec1-1
00:14:42.433 --> 00:14:46.050
in the back and it looks like
they're having a conversation.

2ca79256-2a4e-43ea-b1c3-b099a403b898-0
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.730
And it looks like the.

221942a2-f5d8-4222-bdc9-f5a2db5de123-0
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.927
Original man at is asking this
other man a question. He then

221942a2-f5d8-4222-bdc9-f5a2db5de123-1
00:14:57.927 --> 00:15:03.138
pulls out his book that has
blank paper and he begins to

221942a2-f5d8-4222-bdc9-f5a2db5de123-2
00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:08.624
draw something. And he writes
something on the left side of

221942a2-f5d8-4222-bdc9-f5a2db5de123-3
00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:13.744
the page inside the the
notebook, and then on the right

221942a2-f5d8-4222-bdc9-f5a2db5de123-4
00:15:13.744 --> 00:15:19.687
side he draws a picture of a bed
with a pillow and a blanket and

221942a2-f5d8-4222-bdc9-f5a2db5de123-5
00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:20.510
a window.

de77b2ac-b15c-4c49-9315-63103893a3e3-0
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.040
And the second man says, ah,
yes.

f8f187c3-fcef-409f-b054-a992f6a00675-0
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.110
And he.

ca3008a5-f1e8-458a-a32a-07e90c6b9fe7-0
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.352
He must say follow me because he
kind of motions with his arms

ca3008a5-f1e8-458a-a32a-07e90c6b9fe7-1
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:40.605
for the man to come with him.
And then the second man picks up

ca3008a5-f1e8-458a-a32a-07e90c6b9fe7-2
00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:45.525
a basket that he places on his
back, almost kind of like a

ca3008a5-f1e8-458a-a32a-07e90c6b9fe7-3
00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:50.611
backpack. And there is another
little animal that is kind of

ca3008a5-f1e8-458a-a32a-07e90c6b9fe7-4
00:15:50.611 --> 00:15:53.530
sitting in the basket looking
out.

38129fb8-c76d-4655-a0b7-f1f8e8fdd6e9-0
00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:00.280
Don't know what kind of animal
this is. Possibly.

3b1bb34a-5df4-44d8-a200-16a5dd290e4c-0
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.940
I don't know, kind of like a
possum. He's got a very narrow.

b3f2d75d-39a2-417f-b1e5-5080a0af9f3a-0
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.189
Mouth. It's almost kind of like
a beak. Yeah. And then he has

b3f2d75d-39a2-417f-b1e5-5080a0af9f3a-1
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:17.091
two ears that are kind of tall.
They're they're good size that

b3f2d75d-39a2-417f-b1e5-5080a0af9f3a-2
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:20.560
are tall and thin. Kind of kind
of like a Bunny rabbit.

2f280ba8-b9f2-45fe-807a-93911bba1617-0
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.892
And the man with the suitcase
picks up his suitcase and he

2f280ba8-b9f2-45fe-807a-93911bba1617-1
00:16:25.892 --> 00:16:30.786
follows this other man and the
animal. #END_arrival_3 OK, that

2f280ba8-b9f2-45fe-807a-93911bba1617-2
00:16:30.786 --> 00:16:34.670
was good. OK, so then moving on
to the next item.

9c5ad61d-66e8-4259-9b79-e46f05a80ddc-0
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.731
Um, it is. As you can tell, the
drawing is by the same artist,

9c5ad61d-66e8-4259-9b79-e46f05a80ddc-1
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:45.040
but it's gonna be a different
it's a new story. Yep. OK.

5023402a-8f1f-434e-8677-a583d32ddde6-0
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.806
#START_arrival_6 Alright, so we
have again in these charcoal

5023402a-8f1f-434e-8677-a583d32ddde6-1
00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:57.389
type drawings, black and white
charcoal type drawings, we have

5023402a-8f1f-434e-8677-a583d32ddde6-2
00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:02.884
a picture of a like a little
pot, like a little clay pot that

5023402a-8f1f-434e-8677-a583d32ddde6-3
00:17:02.884 --> 00:17:03.150
is.

1fb1ccb6-3474-434a-aa92-73003ed10126-0
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.380
Sitting on a.

80553990-d9e0-4e93-84a4-7057958726f8-0
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:12.568
Looks like a a desk or a vanity
and behind it kind of against

80553990-d9e0-4e93-84a4-7057958726f8-1
00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:17.385
the wall is a mirror. But we
don't realize it's a mirror

80553990-d9e0-4e93-84a4-7057958726f8-2
00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:21.610
right away. But there is light
that is reflected.

36e1889d-1e73-483a-93e2-5508e4295e16-0
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.712
Maybe it's not a mirror. I feel
like it's a mirror. Yeah, but

36e1889d-1e73-483a-93e2-5508e4295e16-1
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.310
there is light reflected.

f8b940d0-ab19-4abb-9874-b2b028420035-0
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.580
Uh.

b42e79b6-3bf4-4f8b-b7e8-46767bc3b963-0
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.960
Behind this little clay pot and
then in the next picture we see.

ee92d091-eb5b-4ec3-8247-b8646bfeca11-0
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.440
We see something, some kind of
like animal or insect fly down.

850dfa1d-6f09-48cc-8a66-c20041d9b887-0
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.340
To the pot.

33107508-351a-47f5-a546-752a75af2312-0
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.560
It is.

ed99db51-8a8f-4a44-8670-b9e8b0744af5-0
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.400
phew

380e5410-3254-4d58-8e81-ea490fe4f92b-0
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.350
It's got two small legs on the
bottom side.

d195a664-693b-4cfa-9e59-8abea6db69c2-0
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.560
It is.

c411237c-302c-4843-87d4-712e35c96632-0
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.550
Small enough to easily fit into
this pot.

d7739808-32d4-42a4-bf1c-03937dc4319e-0
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:09.203
And it's got wings kind of like
a bird. They're kind of curved

d7739808-32d4-42a4-bf1c-03937dc4319e-1
00:18:09.203 --> 00:18:14.350
on the bottom side and then they
also kind of curve on the top to

d7739808-32d4-42a4-bf1c-03937dc4319e-2
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.520
kind of create.

393c2230-8426-4f5e-b5c9-ed0fc77f3054-0
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.180
like a

cf1eefe2-3e0a-4845-a27d-6f00718753b2-0
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.530
I don't know.

6443d254-e227-4e3d-b0ad-80ab8f6a4712-0
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.793
Trying to think of what shape
that is, kind of like a kind of

6443d254-e227-4e3d-b0ad-80ab8f6a4712-1
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:27.610
looks like a perogie to me or
something like that.

82419804-00cf-4308-a2d8-c1e5e847f420-0
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.040
And then it has.

677454fe-3991-40ca-958d-a89e8a7e6000-0
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.651
Potentially like a whisker on
each side of its little face and

677454fe-3991-40ca-958d-a89e8a7e6000-1
00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:39.933
then on the backside it has a
little bit of a tail, kind of a

677454fe-3991-40ca-958d-a89e8a7e6000-2
00:18:39.933 --> 00:18:43.939
long tail that's splits into
two, kind of like a cocktail

677454fe-3991-40ca-958d-a89e8a7e6000-3
00:18:43.939 --> 00:18:45.390
fork at the very end.

841ba52f-7df9-4d5d-8ac1-753ad4c35823-0
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.750
Anyway, he this little animal
lands onto the pot.

16a32ac6-379a-4dd1-a461-ae33e193302a-0
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:57.525
And then it dives into the pot,
it goes down into the pot and

16a32ac6-379a-4dd1-a461-ae33e193302a-1
00:18:57.525 --> 00:19:02.578
hides. And in that picture we
can clearly see now that there

16a32ac6-379a-4dd1-a461-ae33e193302a-2
00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:07.547
is, I think it's a mirror and
that there is an oil lamp and

16a32ac6-379a-4dd1-a461-ae33e193302a-3
00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:12.517
there's a picture of a man
sitting at the desk he's holding

16a32ac6-379a-4dd1-a461-ae33e193302a-4
00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:17.653
like a fountain pen and he is
writing something on a piece of

16a32ac6-379a-4dd1-a461-ae33e193302a-5
00:19:17.653 --> 00:19:18.150
paper.

8c4fe160-b910-4ca5-962c-8a8b92e91ff4-0
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.770
Uh, in the next picture.

2e6ce7a9-e728-43f9-b068-a5b9a98edaf6-0
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.990
We see.

015ef436-33ab-48bf-983f-32a02bcb12c7-0
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.270
The man. It's a close up of the
man writing.

272d7df4-1dd2-433f-bb40-f5aff8c6c947-0
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.250
On this piece of paper.

c001aa78-41ea-41e9-8e8e-6bcd3cec0b0f-0
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.742
Uh, there's a couple of bills
that are on the table. It looks

c001aa78-41ea-41e9-8e8e-6bcd3cec0b0f-1
00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:41.470
like it's some sort of money,
and it looks like there's.

ada8113a-ec7e-4cda-b2fa-d5f904ccdd08-0
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.140
Possibly like a pepper shaker.

278d6b6a-e24c-4e24-9741-54e96660ae8a-0
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.869
It looks like it's like a glass
container with a lid on the top,

278d6b6a-e24c-4e24-9741-54e96660ae8a-1
00:19:51.869 --> 00:19:57.258
and it's filled about 1/3, maybe
1/3 of the way with like a dark

278d6b6a-e24c-4e24-9741-54e96660ae8a-2
00:19:57.258 --> 00:20:02.481
grain of some sort. It looks to
me like a potentially a pepper

278d6b6a-e24c-4e24-9741-54e96660ae8a-3
00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:07.787
shaker. And the man, after he's
done writing, he begins to fold

278d6b6a-e24c-4e24-9741-54e96660ae8a-4
00:20:07.787 --> 00:20:12.844
the paper into the shape of a
triangle, and then you realize

278d6b6a-e24c-4e24-9741-54e96660ae8a-5
00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:16.410
that he is folding the paper the
triangle.

ead22a8e-5a95-4f7d-92da-c2538710dc84-0
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.262
Into like an origami bird. It's
got like a little beak, it's got

ead22a8e-5a95-4f7d-92da-c2538710dc84-1
00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:27.778
wings. And he puts this little
origami bird into an envelope.

ead22a8e-5a95-4f7d-92da-c2538710dc84-2
00:20:27.778 --> 00:20:32.939
He puts the money into the
envelope and then he licks the

ead22a8e-5a95-4f7d-92da-c2538710dc84-3
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:38.277
seal on the envelope and he
places a stamp in the top right

ead22a8e-5a95-4f7d-92da-c2538710dc84-4
00:20:38.277 --> 00:20:38.899
corner.

22e2a636-ab47-4456-ad38-87e50139c5b5-0
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.180
He then takes.

660e5d8d-0688-447e-908d-74ad8900bd9f-0
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.280
He then gets up and goes
downstairs. We see him walking

660e5d8d-0688-447e-908d-74ad8900bd9f-1
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.716
down a set of stairs. He has
this envelope in his left hand

660e5d8d-0688-447e-908d-74ad8900bd9f-2
00:20:52.716 --> 00:20:57.152
and he's accompanied by this
little animal that I feel like

660e5d8d-0688-447e-908d-74ad8900bd9f-3
00:20:57.152 --> 00:21:01.292
we've seen before in other
stories. It's a little white

660e5d8d-0688-447e-908d-74ad8900bd9f-4
00:21:01.292 --> 00:21:01.810
animal.

942a8c5e-ee3d-49af-adfe-ee33eb5e72c7-0
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.549
It's got like it's kind of like
the shape of like a an Oval kind

942a8c5e-ee3d-49af-adfe-ee33eb5e72c7-1
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:12.707
of like a blimp like that shape
and it's got 2 little ears on

942a8c5e-ee3d-49af-adfe-ee33eb5e72c7-2
00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:15.860
the side and it does have like
kind of a long.

31c3a0e5-178d-4bed-ad0e-cc103cd0637f-0
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:23.014
Tail and the man is now stops in
the street and he's talking to a

31c3a0e5-178d-4bed-ad0e-cc103cd0637f-1
00:21:23.014 --> 00:21:28.099
woman who is dressed in a long
dress. She's carrying a a larger

31c3a0e5-178d-4bed-ad0e-cc103cd0637f-2
00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:33.105
basket in her right hand that
has some kind of an animal in it

31c3a0e5-178d-4bed-ad0e-cc103cd0637f-3
00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:37.952
because we can see the tail
sticking out. And she has like a

31c3a0e5-178d-4bed-ad0e-cc103cd0637f-4
00:21:37.952 --> 00:21:43.116
scarf kind of covering over her
head. We can't see her face, but

31c3a0e5-178d-4bed-ad0e-cc103cd0637f-5
00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:45.579
she has her left hand pointing.

0045c100-f1ab-4308-9d60-e7f1fbf3d1e7-0
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:52.422
And the man is showing her the
envelope, and she's pointing to

0045c100-f1ab-4308-9d60-e7f1fbf3d1e7-1
00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:57.412
him. And so he takes he follows
in the direction that she tells

0045c100-f1ab-4308-9d60-e7f1fbf3d1e7-2
00:21:57.412 --> 00:22:00.220
him, and he comes upon this
little.

44ea0246-f425-48d0-b8a2-cfb599ce229a-0
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.482
Contraption. Uh, it's kind of.
It's. It's kind of like a box,

44ea0246-f425-48d0-b8a2-cfb599ce229a-1
00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:10.910
but then it has wings on the
side and kind of like a cone.

0b1b03e4-d650-4538-a15f-9909617ebe7b-0
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.727
Like birthday cone type of a hat
that sits on the top of it. It

0b1b03e4-d650-4538-a15f-9909617ebe7b-1
00:22:17.727 --> 00:22:18.110
has.

8c8b511d-93d6-4b31-a942-016f03d0561b-0
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.940
2 doors it has.

9114b3c6-4d82-449c-99a1-6533e43fd032-0
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.857
It has a posting on the right
side of some. It's got some kind

9114b3c6-4d82-449c-99a1-6533e43fd032-1
00:22:26.857 --> 00:22:31.624
of writing and then to the left
of that is an opening and it's

9114b3c6-4d82-449c-99a1-6533e43fd032-2
00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:36.089
got 2 doors. It looks like 2
wooden doors that maybe slide

9114b3c6-4d82-449c-99a1-6533e43fd032-3
00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:40.554
opens and then below that there
are a bunch of little like

9114b3c6-4d82-449c-99a1-6533e43fd032-4
00:22:40.554 --> 00:22:45.019
buttons or knobs like control
buttons or knobs. So the man

9114b3c6-4d82-449c-99a1-6533e43fd032-5
00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:48.500
goes up to this contraption and
he reads the.

da0a0801-8168-4f66-a3c5-14bb0dc665fa-0
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.765
He reads what's written that's
posted on the top right and he

da0a0801-8168-4f66-a3c5-14bb0dc665fa-1
00:22:55.765 --> 00:23:01.094
pulls one of the knobs. We can
now see in this picture that he

da0a0801-8168-4f66-a3c5-14bb0dc665fa-2
00:23:01.094 --> 00:23:06.340
it's a knob and he pulls one of
the knobs out towards him and

da0a0801-8168-4f66-a3c5-14bb0dc665fa-3
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:11.754
when he does, the two doors open
up and he is able to place the

da0a0801-8168-4f66-a3c5-14bb0dc665fa-4
00:23:11.754 --> 00:23:14.800
envelope inside of this little
box.

b2e0a561-b7a9-46c0-a204-e7b8d30be9a4-0
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.670
Then we see the man looking up
into the sky.

866bafa7-b121-4f3d-a109-913c2d53bbd9-0
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.310
And you can see that this box,
this cone.

9f10fb46-78d5-4f9b-beac-ba524bf54c48-0
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.340
Piece that was on the top part
of the box is.

6c14a7ff-79a7-4dc0-8fec-761294f0f281-0
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:35.133
Is attached to a string that
leads to a very large white

6c14a7ff-79a7-4dc0-8fec-761294f0f281-1
00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:40.565
round shaped object that appears
to be maybe of some kind of a

6c14a7ff-79a7-4dc0-8fec-761294f0f281-2
00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:45.651
balloon, and it carries this
contraption away and then the

6c14a7ff-79a7-4dc0-8fec-761294f0f281-3
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:50.910
man turns with his little animal
and he walks down the hill.

6b3ed662-d97b-4b86-8e52-efcddc30ef22-0
00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:02.299
{Alright, then we have is this a
new one? This is not just yeah,

6b3ed662-d97b-4b86-8e52-efcddc30ef22-1
00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:06.477
this. OK, there isn't much on
this page so you can just

6b3ed662-d97b-4b86-8e52-efcddc30ef22-2
00:24:06.477 --> 00:24:10.953
describe it really quickly.} OK,
we see, we see a series of

6b3ed662-d97b-4b86-8e52-efcddc30ef22-3
00:24:10.953 --> 00:24:15.280
pictures that are again black
and white, although they be

6b3ed662-d97b-4b86-8e52-efcddc30ef22-4
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.681
they're really kind of brown.
And the first, the first six

6b3ed662-d97b-4b86-8e52-efcddc30ef22-5
00:24:19.681 --> 00:24:21.920
pictures are like a very pale.

e434abb1-d1e6-4b32-b254-8dcaa8dd549c-0
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.586
Brown and white, uh, the second
set of six changes and it

e434abb1-d1e6-4b32-b254-8dcaa8dd549c-1
00:24:27.586 --> 00:24:32.789
becomes a little bit warmer of a
warmer brown. The third set

e434abb1-d1e6-4b32-b254-8dcaa8dd549c-2
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:37.991
becomes a little bit warmer and
then begins to get paler and

e434abb1-d1e6-4b32-b254-8dcaa8dd549c-3
00:24:37.991 --> 00:24:43.279
more muted until it fades out
into more of like a black and a

e434abb1-d1e6-4b32-b254-8dcaa8dd549c-4
00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:48.737
truer black and white type of a
a picture. And we'll start with

e434abb1-d1e6-4b32-b254-8dcaa8dd549c-5
00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:50.870
a leaf it's a picture of.

b1611650-d19b-4b49-9f33-8d696c1cbf04-0
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.680
Don't know if it's the ground or
snow. I would say maybe snow and

b1611650-d19b-4b49-9f33-8d696c1cbf04-1
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.680
there's a leaf. It is.

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-0
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.784
Kind of a shape, maybe like a
pear shape. It's kind of wide at

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-1
00:25:08.784 --> 00:25:12.931
the bottom and then it curves
and is it goes to the top, it

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-2
00:25:12.931 --> 00:25:17.148
points in and narrows. In the
second picture it appears that

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-3
00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:21.295
there might be rain because we
see these little streaks all

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-4
00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:25.719
throughout the picture and the
leaf kind of splits in half. And

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-5
00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:30.212
the next picture you can see the
leaf splitting in half a little

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-6
00:25:30.212 --> 00:25:34.705
bit more and the center stem is
kind of beginning to curl out of

677ab6fd-c3b0-4628-886a-ade9ffbc754b-7
00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:35.120
there.

9303c29d-de12-4d8b-a9ef-e1063c8d5bb9-0
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.326
And in the next picture we see
it open a little bit more. The

9303c29d-de12-4d8b-a9ef-e1063c8d5bb9-1
00:25:40.326 --> 00:25:41.950
stem is more prominent.

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-0
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.705
We see it really kind of open
wide, almost as if it's like a

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-1
00:25:47.705 --> 00:25:52.103
butterfly type of like the leaf
is now split into two, so

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-2
00:25:52.103 --> 00:25:56.653
they're almost kind of like
wings to this stem. And then in

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-3
00:25:56.653 --> 00:26:01.506
the last picture on the top, we
see the leaves kind of wilt and

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-4
00:26:01.506 --> 00:26:05.980
start to die. But the center
stem, the top part has like a

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-5
00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.909
flower that is beginning to get
a little bit bigger. We moved to

6d1ed48b-3e63-4073-93fa-04bfc434cbb4-6
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:12.349
the second set and.

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-0
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.663
The leaves have, are are really
kind of coming off of this stem

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-1
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:22.051
and the the center part of the
flower, the the flower face I

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-2
00:26:22.051 --> 00:26:26.583
guess is getting bigger until
the leaves are completely off of

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-3
00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:30.827
the stem at this point and we
can see that the face of the

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-4
00:26:30.827 --> 00:26:35.071
flower kind of like a very
similar to like a sunflower. So

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-5
00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:39.675
there's like these little petals
that go all the way around and

73275d0b-6c2e-4be5-90b9-2e4b3d97289c-6
00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.330
then a center like eye.

f63a0bb5-988d-49a8-a769-323e361b0faa-0
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.305
We see it in the next picture
very bright. There's like

f63a0bb5-988d-49a8-a769-323e361b0faa-1
00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:46.720
little.

d9930879-c9a8-4ae4-ac01-e783877dd1db-0
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:52.330
Looks like little birds in the
shape of a V that are kind of

d9930879-c9a8-4ae4-ac01-e783877dd1db-1
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:57.586
flying around it. And it's it's
now the stem is now deeper into

d9930879-c9a8-4ae4-ac01-e783877dd1db-2
00:26:57.586 --> 00:26:58.490
the ground.

daf758b2-ea3a-47e1-ba90-b0633fec534d-0
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:05.019
And the next picture we can see
some of the little pieces of the

daf758b2-ea3a-47e1-ba90-b0633fec534d-1
00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:08.690
flower are actually beginning to
come off.

8b7441d4-de7b-44bb-bf39-e65a7f634960-0
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.124
Kind of like a dandelion, like
when those little pieces fall

8b7441d4-de7b-44bb-bf39-e65a7f634960-1
00:27:15.124 --> 00:27:16.040
off and then.

be1e8b61-86fa-4743-bf3f-ec9291949d6a-0
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.559
It appears that there's wind
because now when the next

be1e8b61-86fa-4743-bf3f-ec9291949d6a-1
00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:24.706
picture more is blowing off,
more of these little pieces are

be1e8b61-86fa-4743-bf3f-ec9291949d6a-2
00:27:24.706 --> 00:27:29.125
blowing off the flower until all
of those little pieces are gone

be1e8b61-86fa-4743-bf3f-ec9291949d6a-3
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:33.273
off the flower and it's just,
Umm, it does have a curvy kind

be1e8b61-86fa-4743-bf3f-ec9291949d6a-4
00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:37.420
of back shape to it. And then it
does still have that little

be1e8b61-86fa-4743-bf3f-ec9291949d6a-5
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.159
round center, like like dial in
the center part of it.

dac4b4b0-36f7-4e19-9672-624a3d96a52e-0
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.640
When we moved to the third set
of pictures.

072317b2-6061-4b19-a98e-8913ce1cacdf-0
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.430
We can see now that the.

043999f8-0353-4e68-81be-1b5859167351-0
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.180
There's 12345, 6 kind of curved
scalloped.

999a581d-d3e6-4e0f-aadc-c56f1363b36e-0
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.646
Parts to the edge of the flower
and they have a little white

999a581d-d3e6-4e0f-aadc-c56f1363b36e-1
00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:04.598
speck that is coming through and
each the center of each curve

999a581d-d3e6-4e0f-aadc-c56f1363b36e-2
00:28:04.598 --> 00:28:07.985
part. Then we see in the next
picture what looks like

999a581d-d3e6-4e0f-aadc-c56f1363b36e-3
00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:11.811
dragonflies to be flying around
it. You can see those little

999a581d-d3e6-4e0f-aadc-c56f1363b36e-4
00:28:11.811 --> 00:28:15.387
white specks become a little bit
more prominent when the

999a581d-d3e6-4e0f-aadc-c56f1363b36e-5
00:28:15.387 --> 00:28:16.829
dragonflies fly around.

ce7b8866-2140-4225-9ae4-6491071c816d-0
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.833
Then we see them become even
bigger and they look like eggs.

ce7b8866-2140-4225-9ae4-6491071c816d-1
00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:27.548
These little white specks look
like eggs and the center part of

ce7b8866-2140-4225-9ae4-6491071c816d-2
00:28:27.548 --> 00:28:29.390
each petal of the flower.

0b4e71e7-0dfb-4da2-ac6d-07948710f236-0
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.310
Then we see some of these little
white.

2b8b4cf6-cc44-4e57-a138-daed7dd56c8e-0
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.598
Egg like pieces fall to the
ground and there is another

2b8b4cf6-cc44-4e57-a138-daed7dd56c8e-1
00:28:41.598 --> 00:28:42.880
small animal.

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-0
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:49.313
That has kind of like a curl, a
long curved tail and very pointy

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-1
00:28:49.313 --> 00:28:53.890
ears and a very long narrow
face, and they are over at the

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-2
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:58.468
little white pieces that have
fallen off of this flower. I

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-3
00:28:58.468 --> 00:29:03.433
don't know if they're eating it,
but they're over on the ground

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-4
00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:08.244
with these white pieces until
the white pieces are completely

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-5
00:29:08.244 --> 00:29:12.976
gone from the flower and it all
kind of turns and fades into

4bd76167-e22c-4419-9a5d-14da3feefb86-6
00:29:12.976 --> 00:29:13.519
just a.

85e313a9-9684-4236-830b-163bc139090d-0
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:20.830
Black flower with six scalloped
edges and then the last series

85e313a9-9684-4236-830b-163bc139090d-1
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.830
we see little pieces of the
black.

62896216-c814-4362-a6cb-544dbc61bccd-0
00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.700
Parts of the flower are just
falling off. It does leave

62896216-c814-4362-a6cb-544dbc61bccd-1
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.852
behind still the scalloped
edges, but it's almost like a

62896216-c814-4362-a6cb-544dbc61bccd-2
00:29:34.852 --> 00:29:39.370
webbing that's behind it, so
it's clear and you just see like

62896216-c814-4362-a6cb-544dbc61bccd-3
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:43.450
this webbing behind it and the
pictures progress until.

2ecc79a6-d075-4216-8b10-a4cf8c389386-0
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:50.713
Most of the black has fallen off
and all that's left behind is

2ecc79a6-d075-4216-8b10-a4cf8c389386-1
00:29:50.713 --> 00:29:55.725
like this webbing of the of the
veins of the petals and the

2ecc79a6-d075-4216-8b10-a4cf8c389386-2
00:29:55.725 --> 00:30:00.821
flowers, and then the flower
actually just kind of starts to

2ecc79a6-d075-4216-8b10-a4cf8c389386-3
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:02.910
get deeper into the snow.

90026184-249e-45cf-8bfb-32d7c05f09c3-0
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:12.142
{All right. These are hard.
Yeah, they're really hard.

90026184-249e-45cf-8bfb-32d7c05f09c3-1
00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:14.460
They're so hard to describe.

52c90f2e-35e9-478f-abe8-c8adb93a35c0-0
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.444
It's definitely to move a little
faster, and I'm not sure you can

52c90f2e-35e9-478f-abe8-c8adb93a35c0-1
00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:21.210
just be like.

5cae150a-2c31-438d-8422-d160f5ad9444-0
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.380
You can just move on to the next
thing. OK, alright.}

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-0
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.883
We're back in this black and
white kind of charcoaled

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-1
00:30:30.883 --> 00:30:35.123
picture. It's a scene, it's a,
it's a cityscape. It looks very

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-2
00:30:35.123 --> 00:30:38.891
familiar to what we've
previously seen. But a cityscape

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-3
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:42.525
with these big kind of
industrialized buildings there

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-4
00:30:42.525 --> 00:30:46.764
is, it does look like there's
some white on the ground and the

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-5
00:30:46.764 --> 00:30:51.205
top of the building. So it would
look like it's a cold area where

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-6
00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:55.175
they're potentially would be
snow, like a snowdrift that's

30bff9f6-956a-4a86-ab41-c49abffccc48-7
00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:57.060
kind of fallen on this. Umm.

631c7a08-6df5-4297-9329-affd94ad1c9f-0
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.300
There are cone shaped.

fb6a5e36-35bd-4cfe-93ba-ee3d88f03bf1-0
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.937
Buildings and then there are
little keep calling them pots,

fb6a5e36-35bd-4cfe-93ba-ee3d88f03bf1-1
00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:10.130
but they're like kind of little
pot shaped pieces that are on

fb6a5e36-35bd-4cfe-93ba-ee3d88f03bf1-2
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.120
top of the building you will see
some of the flying boats.

c10ea739-81ad-40b6-998a-78e4620dc458-0
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:20.036
In here we see we do see a
building that has lots of

c10ea739-81ad-40b6-998a-78e4620dc458-1
00:31:20.036 --> 00:31:20.700
little.

6261c220-523d-4c65-999e-2766d30b3393-0
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.299
Openings that would appear to be
like Windows maybe. And again

6261c220-523d-4c65-999e-2766d30b3393-1
00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:30.461
that's like a factory type
industrialized building. It's

6261c220-523d-4c65-999e-2766d30b3393-2
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:34.987
got a lot of different chimneys
that have steam coming out of

6261c220-523d-4c65-999e-2766d30b3393-3
00:31:34.987 --> 00:31:36.010
them and then.

b227e846-5712-4cc0-9d75-879d607be07a-0
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:42.230
In the next picture we see kind
of a close up of some of this.

b227e846-5712-4cc0-9d75-879d607be07a-1
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:47.497
We do see a very large cone
shaped structure. We see kind of

b227e846-5712-4cc0-9d75-879d607be07a-2
00:31:47.497 --> 00:31:47.670
a.

11dffd44-6545-479f-a0e1-3b7aa6f01ac9-0
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.501
Tubular structure that has these
little pots of different sizes

11dffd44-6545-479f-a0e1-3b7aa6f01ac9-1
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:57.110
that are on them and then
there's some round.

8b89e20c-769a-4ceb-87c4-807c017c669b-0
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.525
Round pieces, they look like
plates, they look like dinner

8b89e20c-769a-4ceb-87c4-807c017c669b-1
00:32:04.525 --> 00:32:08.391
plates and they have a
triangular kind of geometric

8b89e20c-769a-4ceb-87c4-807c017c669b-2
00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:13.148
pattern to them. We do see some
other buildings in the back. We

8b89e20c-769a-4ceb-87c4-807c017c669b-3
00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:14.709
see some more of the.

546b0fea-d024-4274-b855-6e034994371d-0
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:20.777
Flying boats and some more of
the chimneys that have the steam

546b0fea-d024-4274-b855-6e034994371d-1
00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:22.420
coming out of them.

ea9371b5-0a00-4bd9-a67e-0e6fb628eb0b-0
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.700
All right, we're back and we see
a little pot and.

1cd87ad4-3c70-4fb3-b31e-88a41525d56c-0
00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.238
{Should I tie this into the
previous one or no? Do I always

1cd87ad4-3c70-4fb3-b31e-88a41525d56c-1
00:32:36.238 --> 00:32:38.510
pretend like they've never seen
the others?

4be05b1d-2301-4a78-b350-4c0a04a0ff92-0
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.798
This is 1 item, so definitely
back to if you've seen this in

4be05b1d-2301-4a78-b350-4c0a04a0ff92-1
00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:49.607
this same set, then you can tie
it back because it tells the

4be05b1d-2301-4a78-b350-4c0a04a0ff92-2
00:32:49.607 --> 00:32:54.416
story. Yes. OK, all right.} So
we see the little pot that we

4be05b1d-2301-4a78-b350-4c0a04a0ff92-3
00:32:54.416 --> 00:32:59.461
previously saw on the desk that
had the little animal or insect

4be05b1d-2301-4a78-b350-4c0a04a0ff92-4
00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:04.349
in it, and we can see the tips
of what appears to be 3 little

4be05b1d-2301-4a78-b350-4c0a04a0ff92-5
00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:07.659
ones that are inside of the pot.
Another.

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-0
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.825
Animal, the same animal, maybe
the mom, it looks like maybe

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-1
00:33:12.825 --> 00:33:17.346
there's babies inside of there.
The mom animal is flying back

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-2
00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:22.086
down to the pot where the three
little babies are, and she lands

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-3
00:33:22.086 --> 00:33:26.535
on the pot with their three
babies. And then we get a bigger

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-4
00:33:26.535 --> 00:33:31.275
picture and we can tell that the
pot is kind of in the window of

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-5
00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:35.650
this little apartment. There's
just inside of the apartment

31893922-92b2-47e7-afcc-587986a907de-6
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.369
from the window. Oh, now we
realize it's a window.

fbad3567-1812-4cf3-89ac-2fdef9c8c5f2-0
00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:44.283
Not a mirror. We can see the
desk that we saw with the man

fbad3567-1812-4cf3-89ac-2fdef9c8c5f2-1
00:33:44.283 --> 00:33:49.444
that was writing with the oil
lamp. We see the desk inside. We

fbad3567-1812-4cf3-89ac-2fdef9c8c5f2-2
00:33:49.444 --> 00:33:54.441
can tell that there is clothes.
Clothes that are hanging off

fbad3567-1812-4cf3-89ac-2fdef9c8c5f2-3
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:59.356
like a clothesline with clothes
pins. We see some socks and

fbad3567-1812-4cf3-89ac-2fdef9c8c5f2-4
00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:02.470
pants, maybe a towel or
handkerchief.

4e924433-0388-42c5-aa53-6745f69c536f-0
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.850
You see on the wall of the
apartment a bunch of letters and

4e924433-0388-42c5-aa53-6745f69c536f-1
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.223
maybe postcards that are pinned
against the wall. The desk also

4e924433-0388-42c5-aa53-6745f69c536f-2
00:34:12.223 --> 00:34:16.665
has a bunch of books on it, and
there's two drawers. On the left

4e924433-0388-42c5-aa53-6745f69c536f-3
00:34:16.665 --> 00:34:20.696
side of the desk there is a
chair that's got some clothing

4e924433-0388-42c5-aa53-6745f69c536f-4
00:34:20.696 --> 00:34:21.790
hanging over it.

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-0
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:27.434
And then behind the desk we see
a bed. We see the man that had

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-1
00:34:27.434 --> 00:34:31.919
drawn the picture of the bed. He
is sitting on the edge of the

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-2
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:36.546
bed looking at a frame, a framed
picture of him and his wife and

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-3
00:34:36.546 --> 00:34:40.675
his child that I know we've
previously seen. He does have

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-4
00:34:40.675 --> 00:34:44.946
his little white animal friend
is sitting behind him on the

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-5
00:34:44.946 --> 00:34:49.360
bed. He's got his shoes off to
the right side and then to the

05d3130c-227a-4af3-9e86-4c9da7535803-6
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.920
left. It looks like there's
another small little.

79faee51-685c-4324-81e5-6e263d4ad220-0
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:57.862
Bookshelf that has, uh, like a
vase with another animal tail

79faee51-685c-4324-81e5-6e263d4ad220-1
00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:02.636
hanging out. And then in front
of that there's a bigger pot

79faee51-685c-4324-81e5-6e263d4ad220-2
00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:05.580
it's got. It's kind of like a
round.

01bb0b7c-a13e-4ee1-9596-e962703eca8d-0
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.300
Pot, and it's got like a dome.

325b7da3-4762-4ec6-bfaf-7e04ab5318c1-0
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.510
A domed style lid on it.

fdc9e740-6b86-4c33-ba1b-427a1132f091-0
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:21.064
We see the little white animal
that's lying behind him on the

fdc9e740-6b86-4c33-ba1b-427a1132f091-1
00:35:21.064 --> 00:35:22.580
bed gets up and.

a7020dd4-7a9b-43c1-b066-d11eb7e9362a-0
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:29.576
He gets off of the bed. The man
turns around to his right, still

a7020dd4-7a9b-43c1-b066-d11eb7e9362a-1
00:35:29.576 --> 00:35:33.644
holding the picture in his left
hand, and he watches as the

a7020dd4-7a9b-43c1-b066-d11eb7e9362a-2
00:35:33.644 --> 00:35:38.051
animal goes down. There's like a
little hole in the wooden floor

a7020dd4-7a9b-43c1-b066-d11eb7e9362a-3
00:35:38.051 --> 00:35:42.390
with a ladder, and he hops down
the ladder down into the wooden

a7020dd4-7a9b-43c1-b066-d11eb7e9362a-4
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.255
floor and the male. The man,
follows behind him down the

a7020dd4-7a9b-43c1-b066-d11eb7e9362a-5
00:35:46.255 --> 00:35:46.729
ladder.

1321f57b-253d-44ad-a92f-a11d7f01c9cd-0
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:53.128
Where he sees the little animal
is next to the wall, where there

1321f57b-253d-44ad-a92f-a11d7f01c9cd-1
00:35:53.128 --> 00:35:58.090
is a little opening of some
sort, and on the ground is a

1321f57b-253d-44ad-a92f-a11d7f01c9cd-2
00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:58.699
letter.

3ad7404f-6459-46e5-8e39-a7da35a623d5-0
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:04.374
And the man picks up the letter,
he opens up the letter and he oh

3ad7404f-6459-46e5-8e39-a7da35a623d5-1
00:36:04.374 --> 00:36:06.180
this is a different man.

aa86443a-87ec-4b58-9c57-45fc8c6f56ac-0
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.984
Oh wait, I'm so confused. He
opens up the letter and out he

aa86443a-87ec-4b58-9c57-45fc8c6f56ac-1
00:36:11.984 --> 00:36:17.094
pulls this origami bird and then
and he opens up the origami bird

aa86443a-87ec-4b58-9c57-45fc8c6f56ac-2
00:36:17.094 --> 00:36:21.816
and it is the note that the
previous man had written. And he

aa86443a-87ec-4b58-9c57-45fc8c6f56ac-3
00:36:21.816 --> 00:36:26.771
goes to the window and he looks
out the window holding the note

aa86443a-87ec-4b58-9c57-45fc8c6f56ac-4
00:36:26.771 --> 00:36:28.010
up into the sky.

aa81843c-5dc8-4cc7-b01d-8c8240fa8fc1-0
00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:38.253
And we see a series of nine
pictures, 3, 3 vertical and

aa81843c-5dc8-4cc7-b01d-8c8240fa8fc1-1
00:36:38.253 --> 00:36:40.100
three horizontal.

aba576b5-4777-49ae-804e-60b8010fc7ad-0
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.303
Like, yeah. So that it's kind of
like a square. We see another

aba576b5-4777-49ae-804e-60b8010fc7ad-1
00:36:47.303 --> 00:36:49.030
picture of an origami.

55a4ffdb-9157-4014-bff2-40e7ae48af5f-0
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:53.602
Animal of some sort. It's not a
bird though. It's got four legs

55a4ffdb-9157-4014-bff2-40e7ae48af5f-1
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:57.086
and it looks like it has, it
looks like the little white

55a4ffdb-9157-4014-bff2-40e7ae48af5f-2
00:36:57.086 --> 00:37:00.938
animal actually kind of, it's
kind of got a tail. It's like an

55a4ffdb-9157-4014-bff2-40e7ae48af5f-3
00:37:00.938 --> 00:37:04.728
origami of this little white
animal. In the second picture we

55a4ffdb-9157-4014-bff2-40e7ae48af5f-4
00:37:04.728 --> 00:37:05.890
see some kind of a.

4f715791-f8af-4bb7-83d2-c15cfe7c1cbb-0
00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:12.669
Oh what is this like a machine?
It's kind of like a cone top

4f715791-f8af-4bb7-83d2-c15cfe7c1cbb-1
00:37:12.669 --> 00:37:17.668
shaped machine and on the inside
it's got kind of like the plates

4f715791-f8af-4bb7-83d2-c15cfe7c1cbb-2
00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:22.136
that we saw in the other one.
It's got they're round plate

4f715791-f8af-4bb7-83d2-c15cfe7c1cbb-3
00:37:22.136 --> 00:37:26.908
like type. There's two sizes,
the smaller one and a larger one

4f715791-f8af-4bb7-83d2-c15cfe7c1cbb-4
00:37:26.908 --> 00:37:31.528
and they appear to have like
that triangular geometric shape

4f715791-f8af-4bb7-83d2-c15cfe7c1cbb-5
00:37:31.528 --> 00:37:32.740
pattern to them.

d09bdbe3-05c7-4fdd-bf51-d89d721d3580-0
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.400
We have a picture of a.

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-0
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.671
Like a a a rack, like a wooden
little rack with hooks on it

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-1
00:37:43.671 --> 00:37:48.463
that would be affixed to a wall.
There's a picture of the man's

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-2
00:37:48.463 --> 00:37:53.254
hat and then some kind of white
fabric that's hanging. There is

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-3
00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:57.971
a bowl with something kind of
similar to like a cocktail fork.

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-4
00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:02.613
There's only two sprongs on the
end and there are like tails,

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-5
00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:07.554
kind of like that curve that are
coming out of the bowl and there

979dbf5a-4a81-4034-ab73-ac3747b50a02-6
00:38:07.554 --> 00:38:09.950
is a little egg off to the side.

296d4d37-a375-4f34-927b-9421c05bf0c5-0
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:14.112
There is a picture that looks
like it's been hand drawn by a

296d4d37-a375-4f34-927b-9421c05bf0c5-1
00:38:14.112 --> 00:38:18.139
kid of the clouds and one of
those flying boats, and it has a

296d4d37-a375-4f34-927b-9421c05bf0c5-2
00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:22.231
picture of a person in there,
one of the other ones that looks

296d4d37-a375-4f34-927b-9421c05bf0c5-3
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:24.700
like it has pictures of like the
sun.

92b38a83-252c-459e-8b1c-d613eb9df70f-0
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.640
We see.

a2cdcc84-93b7-4359-8de5-582b525fe76f-0
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:34.111
I guess what is like a coffee
type of a urn, some something

a2cdcc84-93b7-4359-8de5-582b525fe76f-1
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:38.985
that's metal that has like a
little bit of a spout on the

a2cdcc84-93b7-4359-8de5-582b525fe76f-2
00:38:38.985 --> 00:38:42.010
front side that somehow would
hold.

7dbf522e-6609-424f-bc41-18e0c3cea4e8-0
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:47.355
And pour out coffee, because we
do see a coffee cup and a saucer

7dbf522e-6609-424f-bc41-18e0c3cea4e8-1
00:38:47.355 --> 00:38:52.092
sitting on top of a newspaper in
the next scene. Then we see this

7dbf522e-6609-424f-bc41-18e0c3cea4e8-2
00:38:52.092 --> 00:38:56.613
picture of a man and a woman and
a little girl. And finally we

7dbf522e-6609-424f-bc41-18e0c3cea4e8-3
00:38:56.613 --> 00:39:00.848
see the picture of the man's
hand giving the little girl a

7dbf522e-6609-424f-bc41-18e0c3cea4e8-4
00:39:00.848 --> 00:39:02.140
coin at the table.

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-0
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.380
All right, now we can see the
bigger picture, and we've got

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-1
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.626
the man and the woman sitting at
the table. The woman is sitting

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-2
00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:18.612
at one end. The man is sitting
next to her, and at the other

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-3
00:39:18.612 --> 00:39:22.140
end is the little girl. She's
sitting in a chair with

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-4
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.125
something kind of draped over
one of the sides of the chair.

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-5
00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:30.111
And we can see the food on the
table, the coffee cup. We see

24bef1f2-da63-41db-989a-9d28d7e1f439-6
00:39:30.111 --> 00:39:32.789
the man giving the little girl
the coin.

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-0
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.508
We see the little animal, white
animal friend with the curved

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-1
00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:41.956
tail is to the right of little
girl on the floor and he's kind

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-2
00:39:41.956 --> 00:39:46.193
of looking up. It appears that
he might have his tongue out

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-3
00:39:46.193 --> 00:39:50.783
trying to get some kind of food.
And then we can see against the

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-4
00:39:50.783 --> 00:39:55.373
wall behind the mom, like maybe
the side of a fireplace that has

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-5
00:39:55.373 --> 00:39:59.751
also a, a triangular geometric
pattern to it similar to those

f5d584dd-1b2a-4883-95ff-83756510f8a3-6
00:39:59.751 --> 00:40:04.130
plates does have little mantle.
And then there are there's a.

4036d956-2a44-41b5-8350-d291be6085d1-0
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.783
On the ledge of the wall we can
see the hook with the hat and

4036d956-2a44-41b5-8350-d291be6085d1-1
00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:12.903
this fabric that's hanging.
Pictures that the little girl

4036d956-2a44-41b5-8350-d291be6085d1-2
00:40:12.903 --> 00:40:17.094
has probably drawn that are
posted on the wall. Origami of

4036d956-2a44-41b5-8350-d291be6085d1-3
00:40:17.094 --> 00:40:21.426
the little white animal, as well
as the family picture. Some

4036d956-2a44-41b5-8350-d291be6085d1-4
00:40:21.426 --> 00:40:25.901
other pictures. A plant looks
like there's a vase with a large

4036d956-2a44-41b5-8350-d291be6085d1-5
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:29.240
flower sitting out of it and
then this little.

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-0
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:34.215
Contraption that's kind of cone
shaped that has the two little

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-1
00:40:34.215 --> 00:40:38.453
plates on the inside. Then we
see the little girl in the next

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-2
00:40:38.453 --> 00:40:42.553
picture putting on her boots.
They're like rain boots, like

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-3
00:40:42.553 --> 00:40:46.996
plastic kind of rain boots. And
the little animal friend fetches

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-4
00:40:46.996 --> 00:40:51.165
her her hat, she has like a
black knit hat. She puts her hat

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-5
00:40:51.165 --> 00:40:55.060
on her head and she goes with
the animal friend down the

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-6
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.956
steps. She's they're now
outside, so they've gone out of

91e66ef0-01c9-4217-9efd-98324b2d5b51-7
00:40:58.956 --> 00:40:59.640
the house.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.217
And they've gone down the steps
and they crossover. Looks like

6ca32e4b-a139-4855-836f-ccf367b88c5c-1
00:41:04.217 --> 00:41:08.445
they crossover some water. She
hops over, they both hop over

6ca32e4b-a139-4855-836f-ccf367b88c5c-2
00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:12.465
some water and there are these
little white lights. These

6ca32e4b-a139-4855-836f-ccf367b88c5c-3
00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:16.832
little white orbs that we saw
previously in the air are now on

6ca32e4b-a139-4855-836f-ccf367b88c5c-4
00:41:16.832 --> 00:41:21.130
the ground. And the little girl
points to one of them and she

6ca32e4b-a139-4855-836f-ccf367b88c5c-5
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.250
picks it up in her left hand.

57a715b8-dbbc-405d-9b9a-ff432a3ac3b7-0
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:32.701
OK. That was good. That was a
that part of the story. So OK,

57a715b8-dbbc-405d-9b9a-ff432a3ac3b7-1
00:41:32.701 --> 00:41:34.720
another part, OK.

3df9132a-36f0-44e2-8336-6c2e5f678cc0-0
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.720
All right. We're back in the
same.

26d428a3-e9f9-4275-ac2c-8f093c5283a6-0
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.633
#START_arrival_5 Black, brown
and white charcoal, we see kind

26d428a3-e9f9-4275-ac2c-8f093c5283a6-1
00:41:44.633 --> 00:41:49.890
of looking down on the edge of a
boating town. There is a dock,

26d428a3-e9f9-4275-ac2c-8f093c5283a6-2
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:54.983
there's we can see water at the
bottom of the picture. We can

26d428a3-e9f9-4275-ac2c-8f093c5283a6-3
00:41:54.983 --> 00:41:59.830
see a boat that has I believe
three people in it and it is

26d428a3-e9f9-4275-ac2c-8f093c5283a6-4
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:05.087
rowing to shore, but there is a
little bit of like a boat ramp.

26d428a3-e9f9-4275-ac2c-8f093c5283a6-5
00:42:05.087 --> 00:42:09.769
So it's very close to the ramp.
It does have some large.

6a404068-61f6-4358-8fc9-8a57bc37e034-0
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:15.870
Rocks to the left that kind of
are in the front of this.

9a78dd85-008f-4c22-8f44-c32f916ce87b-0
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.070
Little.

25f3a87c-0b46-4044-a3d0-60856b6b411a-0
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.020
Oh, what do you call it? It's.

5e0b3b9e-f00a-4d18-9569-1b7881049c15-0
00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.444
It's like a bunch of different
housing and apartments that are

5e0b3b9e-f00a-4d18-9569-1b7881049c15-1
00:42:28.444 --> 00:42:32.549
all connected together and kind
of built into the side of this

5e0b3b9e-f00a-4d18-9569-1b7881049c15-2
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:36.327
hill or this mountain. It's
really, I guess it's really a

5e0b3b9e-f00a-4d18-9569-1b7881049c15-3
00:42:36.327 --> 00:42:39.390
hill, but the boat dock leads in
front of the.

cf08f3ea-2cf3-4cae-9458-227118fc8bc0-0
00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.395
The residences and the houses
and it leads kind of all the way

cf08f3ea-2cf3-4cae-9458-227118fc8bc0-1
00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:48.264
up and you can see there's
different boats lined up that

cf08f3ea-2cf3-4cae-9458-227118fc8bc0-2
00:42:48.264 --> 00:42:52.404
people would use instead of
cars. So you normally would park

cf08f3ea-2cf3-4cae-9458-227118fc8bc0-3
00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:56.408
your car there. You would you
instead have all these boats

cf08f3ea-2cf3-4cae-9458-227118fc8bc0-4
00:42:56.408 --> 00:42:59.937
lined up and it goes up the
hillside. On top of the

cf08f3ea-2cf3-4cae-9458-227118fc8bc0-5
00:42:59.937 --> 00:43:01.770
buildings are these little.

ba6c617b-5c05-43f7-8588-ed0d49f26f85-0
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.550
They're structures and there's
they're different sizes.

bce7025a-9fb1-4af1-af98-1e2046ed8433-0
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.978
But they look like owls. They're
like structures that kind of

bce7025a-9fb1-4af1-af98-1e2046ed8433-1
00:43:11.978 --> 00:43:16.413
look like owls that you can see
the a real prominent kind of

bce7025a-9fb1-4af1-af98-1e2046ed8433-2
00:43:16.413 --> 00:43:20.921
flat nose and eyes and the arch
arches over the eyes and then

bce7025a-9fb1-4af1-af98-1e2046ed8433-3
00:43:20.921 --> 00:43:25.648
flat tops. You do see a bunch of
birds flying around at the very

bce7025a-9fb1-4af1-af98-1e2046ed8433-4
00:43:25.648 --> 00:43:30.156
top of it and you can kind of
see, I guess that's the sun off

bce7025a-9fb1-4af1-af98-1e2046ed8433-5
00:43:30.156 --> 00:43:31.320
in the distance.

21ca6809-2d5f-4779-9e73-db2eee25b601-0
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:37.286
We then see a pair of hands, a
pair of man's hands, and they

21ca6809-2d5f-4779-9e73-db2eee25b601-1
00:43:37.286 --> 00:43:37.560
are.

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-0
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:42.414
Tying. They're putting rope
around a something that looks

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-1
00:43:42.414 --> 00:43:47.130
like it's got like a cat's face,
but then the neck goes down into

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-2
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:51.488
the shape of a cone and he's got
like rope that he's putting

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-3
00:43:51.488 --> 00:43:55.704
around this. Then we see him
holding a basket in his right

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-4
00:43:55.704 --> 00:43:59.634
hand, and he's got on
suspenders, eyeglasses, he's got

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-5
00:43:59.634 --> 00:44:03.992
a smile on his face and he's
holding his left hand open. And

106f20f7-98bf-4166-8dc7-ff6f9768a31d-6
00:44:03.992 --> 00:44:08.280
there is another man off to his
right wearing a black coat.

618d0ffe-95ae-43b5-9fea-5a62f54d4fc0-0
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.248
In a Black Hat, we can't see his
face. Um. We then see a little

618d0ffe-95ae-43b5-9fea-5a62f54d4fc0-1
00:44:13.248 --> 00:44:17.831
boy carrying a basket with a
little white animal behind him

618d0ffe-95ae-43b5-9fea-5a62f54d4fc0-2
00:44:17.831 --> 00:44:19.970
to the left and a different.

a6cd30df-4546-41ca-be4b-d8db6bf846b9-0
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.228
Black animal, kind of more like
the shape of a cat with spikes

a6cd30df-4546-41ca-be4b-d8db6bf846b9-1
00:44:25.228 --> 00:44:29.460
on the back and a longer tail is
off to his right he then.

33c5e39e-00a5-4aad-a07a-beda5466e2e5-0
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.280
Goes up the stairs and he.

d920598d-df41-4e69-9a76-9ed9543f897e-0
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.470
Takes the basket.

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-0
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:42.161
To a woman who's wearing kind of
like a white patterned dress.

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-1
00:44:42.161 --> 00:44:45.816
She's got dark brown hair. We
then see the man with his

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-2
00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:49.798
glasses and suspenders. He's
carrying his basket and he goes

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-3
00:44:49.798 --> 00:44:53.583
and he kisses the woman on the
cheek and she puts her arm

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-4
00:44:53.583 --> 00:44:57.630
around the neck. And we see that
the man with the glasses and

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-5
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.872
suspenders has brought the other
man with the hat and the jacket

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-6
00:45:01.872 --> 00:45:05.984
up and the woman put holds out
her hand and shakes the hand of

77182940-6cb6-4544-80b0-ff6295418b63-7
00:45:05.984 --> 00:45:07.420
that the man with the.

793198fc-ff2c-4809-89de-a899f34e4f00-0
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:09.930
Hat. She invites him in.

0a7b2a50-440b-4e78-b1f1-13532459d689-0
00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:15.817
And then they cheers. There's
four hands that are toasting

0a7b2a50-440b-4e78-b1f1-13532459d689-1
00:45:15.817 --> 00:45:20.255
with of glasses, drinking
glasses with some kind of liquid

0a7b2a50-440b-4e78-b1f1-13532459d689-2
00:45:20.255 --> 00:45:24.692
in it, and they kind of cheers
each other. You can see the

0a7b2a50-440b-4e78-b1f1-13532459d689-3
00:45:24.692 --> 00:45:29.280
woman take the items out of the
basket, one of which kind of

0a7b2a50-440b-4e78-b1f1-13532459d689-4
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.710
looks like a snail.

fb7e6318-f122-4a6f-b899-a950fca9d091-0
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.180
She then begins to.

e8d8dfc1-e456-4b8b-828f-7e6f59c5f22d-0
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.530
Cut another.

1512418c-e558-4ed4-b2d5-e6dd55f4639f-0
00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.543
Round kind of gourd like item in
the basket. It's dark on the

1512418c-e558-4ed4-b2d5-e6dd55f4639f-1
00:45:41.543 --> 00:45:45.886
outside, but when she slices it
like a cucumber almost with like

1512418c-e558-4ed4-b2d5-e6dd55f4639f-2
00:45:45.886 --> 00:45:49.829
a butcher knife, there's like a
round center part and then

1512418c-e558-4ed4-b2d5-e6dd55f4639f-3
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:54.106
there's a white. The rest of it
is white, but it does have like

1512418c-e558-4ed4-b2d5-e6dd55f4639f-4
00:45:54.106 --> 00:45:58.182
white, she it does have dark,
kind of like spikes all around

1512418c-e558-4ed4-b2d5-e6dd55f4639f-5
00:45:58.182 --> 00:45:59.720
it. She then begins to.

21573735-41e1-4669-8e1e-284486625688-0
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.658
I don't know what she's doing in
this picture. It looks like

21573735-41e1-4669-8e1e-284486625688-1
00:46:04.658 --> 00:46:05.780
maybe that coffee urn.

2fc890ff-eebe-4163-a544-f8726d08ef70-0
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:08.570
That we've seen before she's
putting.

8eb9e80a-34bf-4053-9fb7-e60145e6a5ee-0
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.534
Something, maybe into the coffee
urn to grant that some in this

8eb9e80a-34bf-4053-9fb7-e60145e6a5ee-1
00:46:14.534 --> 00:46:19.389
machine must make it into. Take
this and make it into a liquid.

8eb9e80a-34bf-4053-9fb7-e60145e6a5ee-2
00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:21.209
Maybe it's a juicer and.

3246cd3d-41f3-4497-8ec5-a5462bd3931e-0
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.060
She then takes a cup.

bd1a6f80-872d-4679-8efd-5438a806b23a-0
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.200
And you can see her with.

bdb088c8-f996-4cec-bc9f-25096d7d423c-0
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.309
Like a kind of like a paint
brush or like a pastry brush and

bdb088c8-f996-4cec-bc9f-25096d7d423c-1
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:33.650
she is brushing.

17697b88-441d-4a6b-b58c-38f522cccb8a-0
00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.940
What looks like might be a
chicken.

60ff4e8c-ee68-4042-bbdc-ebd50ac1c285-0
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:44.472
That's like ready to be cooked,
right? Then we see the ohh. Then

60ff4e8c-ee68-4042-bbdc-ebd50ac1c285-1
00:46:44.472 --> 00:46:49.301
we see them all at the dining
table. We see the little boy at

60ff4e8c-ee68-4042-bbdc-ebd50ac1c285-2
00:46:49.301 --> 00:46:51.560
one end. He's got his little.

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-0
00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:57.030
Black cat friend and this little
white animal friend and he's

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-1
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:01.447
giving them some food from the
table. They're down on the

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-2
00:47:01.447 --> 00:47:06.167
ground, but we see like a table
runner that is running across

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-3
00:47:06.167 --> 00:47:11.040
the table. Across the table is
his mom. To his right is the man

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-4
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.761
who is their guest and then his
dad is to the left and we can

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-5
00:47:15.761 --> 00:47:20.254
see plates and silverware and
food platters. We see a wine

5a961b50-184c-4b43-83d6-a02da7ad0609-6
00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:22.310
glass all out on the table.

f6fe2c6c-ca6e-4f1f-baef-b76fcc813989-0
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.868
The mom is talking to the man
who is the guest and the dad is

f6fe2c6c-ca6e-4f1f-baef-b76fcc813989-1
00:47:27.868 --> 00:47:33.180
cooking the food. He has this
contraption, it's kind of got

f6fe2c6c-ca6e-4f1f-baef-b76fcc813989-2
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:39.023
like a hose and it it shoots out
fire and he is holding like with

f6fe2c6c-ca6e-4f1f-baef-b76fcc813989-3
00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:44.247
a pair of tongs, a piece of
food. And he's using this fire

f6fe2c6c-ca6e-4f1f-baef-b76fcc813989-4
00:47:44.247 --> 00:47:47.699
to kind of cook the food at the
table.

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-0
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:53.428
Then we see a series of smaller
pictures. We can see the dad

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-1
00:47:53.428 --> 00:47:57.009
drinking a glass of wine,
smiling. We see the mom

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-2
00:47:57.009 --> 00:48:01.521
laughing. She's got a glass of
wine and and food on her plate.

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-3
00:48:01.521 --> 00:48:05.961
We can see the man who's the
guest is eating. He's got like a

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-4
00:48:05.961 --> 00:48:10.472
a fork and he's got a piece of
food on the fork. He's smiling.

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-5
00:48:10.472 --> 00:48:15.199
We see the dad then after dinner
bring out this instrument that's

4b58a0ee-e085-463e-8de4-74d31f034683-6
00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:19.209
kind of like a xylophone. Again.
His hands are on each.

ae323dbc-6e1a-4b99-84b5-b714b8b52704-0
00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:24.609
end and you can kind of expand
and contract contract this this

ae323dbc-6e1a-4b99-84b5-b714b8b52704-1
00:48:24.609 --> 00:48:28.240
instrument it does have these
little like.

e1002f5f-36f6-4f5f-9516-74e56d758436-0
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.980
Tuba not tuba like trumpet type
of.

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-0
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.917
Things that come out of the top,
there's two on one side, one and

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-1
00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:43.769
another. Then we have the mom
playing kind of like a flute,

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-2
00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:47.622
but it has like a trumpet end.
And at the end of that it, I

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-3
00:48:47.622 --> 00:48:51.667
swear there's like a either fire
or candle coming out of that.

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-4
00:48:51.667 --> 00:48:55.776
Some kind of a light is coming
out of it, but she's playing it.

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-5
00:48:55.776 --> 00:48:59.949
She's got it up to her lips and
she's using her fingers to cover

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-6
00:48:59.949 --> 00:49:03.930
holes while she blows through
the instrument. And then we see

2d00d3fd-a53d-4e86-85f4-7a4686b9e9e5-7
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.599
the boy playing something.

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-0
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:10.062
Kind of like a banjo. It's got
some strings. It's round and

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-1
00:49:10.062 --> 00:49:14.747
he's playing that and we can see
his little Kitty cat friend is

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-2
00:49:14.747 --> 00:49:19.139
smiling and laughing very, very
wide. The the man who's the

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-3
00:49:19.139 --> 00:49:23.678
guest then pulls out some paper
that is kind of folded and he

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-4
00:49:23.678 --> 00:49:28.290
makes a piece of he turns the
piece of paper into origami that

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-5
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:32.975
is kind of like this cat for the
little boy, and he gives it to

1f48f2e4-c6e1-4f3f-91d7-3234fae00a57-6
00:49:32.975 --> 00:49:35.830
the little boy. Then the dad
opens up.

5c63d3aa-4d15-4654-9b14-ae7f47aacc37-0
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:41.232
A little cabinet against he
pulls out a pot, and then he and

5c63d3aa-4d15-4654-9b14-ae7f47aacc37-1
00:49:41.232 --> 00:49:46.283
his wife were holding this pot
in their hands, and they I

5c63d3aa-4d15-4654-9b14-ae7f47aacc37-2
00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:49.070
believe they give it to the man.

75748282-455d-4394-afdf-d953707f0e6d-0
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:57.740
Now we see this same pot sitting
on that desk. You're sitting on

75748282-455d-4394-afdf-d953707f0e6d-1
00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:03.330
a table or a desk in front of
this, this window. We see that.

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-0
00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:08.595
The man rises from Brett from
bed. He he kind of sits up,

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-1
00:50:08.595 --> 00:50:13.235
partially sits up, rubs his
eyes. He's wearing like a white

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-2
00:50:13.235 --> 00:50:18.261
sleeveless tank top. We see the
little animal hop on his lap and

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-3
00:50:18.261 --> 00:50:23.365
he pets the little white animal.
And then we see him get dressed.

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-4
00:50:23.365 --> 00:50:28.237
He's buttoning his white button
down collared shirt. He slices

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-5
00:50:28.237 --> 00:50:33.264
some kind of food with a paring
knife, and then he gives half of

44eba7c7-367b-43bb-b651-aa0802888453-6
00:50:33.264 --> 00:50:33.960
the food.

556cd8f1-5d55-4f82-9439-8e663e78445c-0
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:38.258
To the little white animal. Then
he puts on his vest and his

556cd8f1-5d55-4f82-9439-8e663e78445c-1
00:50:38.258 --> 00:50:42.140
jacket, and the little animal
brings him his Black Hat.

a633be10-cd3e-4e45-af3f-1a1780c9770f-0
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.470
Then we can see the man walking.

5a7f40ed-f98d-41f8-8973-9580d4971be1-0
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.449
down the street, I guess,
through the street with a lot of

5a7f40ed-f98d-41f8-8973-9580d4971be1-1
00:50:54.449 --> 00:50:57.425
people. We're seeing the
backside of him, but we can see

5a7f40ed-f98d-41f8-8973-9580d4971be1-2
00:50:57.425 --> 00:51:00.661
the animal, we can see all these
people walking around him as

5a7f40ed-f98d-41f8-8973-9580d4971be1-3
00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:03.584
well. So he's walking in a
crowd. There are some little

5a7f40ed-f98d-41f8-8973-9580d4971be1-4
00:51:03.584 --> 00:51:06.769
dragonflies flying through the
air and it looks like there's

5a7f40ed-f98d-41f8-8973-9580d4971be1-5
00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:07.030
some.

99f49a80-5411-459b-83f6-e743e6eaf219-0
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:13.575
Like clotheslines with clothes
kind of hanging above these

99f49a80-5411-459b-83f6-e743e6eaf219-1
00:51:13.575 --> 00:51:14.780
people we see.

3eb94e27-d1da-412f-87f0-1aa68c73d77f-0
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:17.540
{Ohh boy.

4644d262-797a-4457-84e7-27c89f0fd198-0
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:24.712
Just out of curiosity, does it
go left and then to the right?

4644d262-797a-4457-84e7-27c89f0fd198-1
00:51:24.712 --> 00:51:29.355
It's 2 pages, right? Right.
Yeah. OK, go down to. OK, all

4644d262-797a-4457-84e7-27c89f0fd198-2
00:51:29.355 --> 00:51:34.318
right, to the other side. All
right, perfect.} So then in the

4644d262-797a-4457-84e7-27c89f0fd198-3
00:51:34.318 --> 00:51:36.640
next scene, we see these men.

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-0
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:42.427
Holding like these long daggers,
um, I'm not sure what they're

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-1
00:51:42.427 --> 00:51:46.585
doing with it. They're, they're
holding them out horizontally.

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-2
00:51:46.585 --> 00:51:50.611
We see a picture of a man with
kind of like a sombrero. He's

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-3
00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:54.834
got on a white collared shirt,
but his, his sleeves are kind of

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-4
00:51:54.834 --> 00:51:58.992
rolled up and he has on a black
vest, and he's carrying a very

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-5
00:51:58.992 --> 00:52:02.688
large basket filled with
something. And there are these

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-6
00:52:02.688 --> 00:52:06.780
little animals that with their
mouths open and they have like

b9effeab-30e9-4d18-a65a-02d44880015d-7
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.760
one eye in the center of them.

d4fe3dfb-a8a6-48c8-9e9b-c91be713f703-0
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:13.502
And they are. They're obviously
to eat. They want whatever the

d4fe3dfb-a8a6-48c8-9e9b-c91be713f703-1
00:52:13.502 --> 00:52:18.303
man is going to hand them. From
this basket we can see a picture

d4fe3dfb-a8a6-48c8-9e9b-c91be713f703-2
00:52:18.303 --> 00:52:20.150
of looks like a tabletop.

f64dc4c6-a913-47e4-8ada-54c89dd955f4-0
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:26.119
A woman dressed with a nice hat
looks like a man behind her with

f64dc4c6-a913-47e4-8ada-54c89dd955f4-1
00:52:26.119 --> 00:52:30.794
kind of like an army uniform,
and I believe she's perhaps

f64dc4c6-a913-47e4-8ada-54c89dd955f4-2
00:52:30.794 --> 00:52:35.953
buying something from the woman
on the other side of the table.

f64dc4c6-a913-47e4-8ada-54c89dd955f4-3
00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:36.760
We have a.

9c418e45-be82-4a5a-b92e-0eea9b5f72a9-0
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.033
A picture of I believe it's a
man who was kind of sitting off

9c418e45-be82-4a5a-b92e-0eea9b5f72a9-1
00:52:43.033 --> 00:52:44.530
on the street and.

63f004d4-c9f2-4382-88eb-94156ddcf5e9-0
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:50.482
Creating art and it's one of
these wheels, it's one of these

63f004d4-c9f2-4382-88eb-94156ddcf5e9-1
00:52:50.482 --> 00:52:54.680
like round circular dinner
looking plates. It looks like

63f004d4-c9f2-4382-88eb-94156ddcf5e9-2
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.246
he's painting the triangular
geometric pattern to that plate,

63f004d4-c9f2-4382-88eb-94156ddcf5e9-3
00:52:59.246 --> 00:53:03.664
like kind of like a street
vendor. We see a man on a ladder

63f004d4-c9f2-4382-88eb-94156ddcf5e9-4
00:53:03.664 --> 00:53:07.715
on an out the outside of a
building and he is painting

63f004d4-c9f2-4382-88eb-94156ddcf5e9-5
00:53:07.715 --> 00:53:09.630
something on the building.

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-0
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.587
And then we see a woman with a
very small cart and she can't

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-1
00:53:14.587 --> 00:53:18.784
quite tell what it is, but
there's some kind of contraption

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-2
00:53:18.784 --> 00:53:22.841
where it kind of like a food
cart, hot dog cart, where it

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-3
00:53:22.841 --> 00:53:27.248
would open up, but I don't know
exactly what she has in there.

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-4
00:53:27.248 --> 00:53:31.166
Then we see the man with his
little white animal friend

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-5
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:35.643
approach a door. We can see what
appears to be a cook come out.

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-6
00:53:35.643 --> 00:53:40.120
The the man has on an apron and
a hat, and he's got a bowl with

156821c4-3f65-4b24-8d6c-16c85ce1f93e-7
00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.029
like a spoon.

f6fdeefa-5126-4437-8973-3542e1a67ceb-0
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:45.577
In his hand, the man is asking

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.191
We then see the man with the
little white animal friend go to

ed2a1931-b24a-4fb1-8329-1f4c4ca88b25-1
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:57.561

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:22.091
Then we see the man go into a
shop. There's a woman at the

OK. OK.

45c7f167-38a5-4dc5-87c0-ca3e6c9f9001-0
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:19.140
And we can go on to the next
item.

9f114b61-c832-4278-ab44-1868389dcc64-0
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.730
OK, the complex scene, OK.

e438f416-f1b6-4010-87f6-a1aa1cd7a8e1-0
01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:28.580
So.

01715040-502e-49e9-8952-ce2165ddbc45-0
01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:35.318
This is also very similar to a
where's Waldo. So I don't think

01715040-502e-49e9-8952-ce2165ddbc45-1
01:03:35.318 --> 01:03:40.342
it is where's Waldo, but it's
that style. #START_by_the_lake

01715040-502e-49e9-8952-ce2165ddbc45-2
01:03:40.342 --> 01:03:45.449
We see a picture, it's titled by
the Lake and it says that it

01715040-502e-49e9-8952-ce2165ddbc45-3
01:03:45.449 --> 01:03:50.473
actually asks you can you pick
out all 10 Penguins. So there

01715040-502e-49e9-8952-ce2165ddbc45-4
01:03:50.473 --> 01:03:54.921
must be 10 Penguins hidden
throughout this particular

01715040-502e-49e9-8952-ce2165ddbc45-5
01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:55.580
picture.

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-0
01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.434
And it's kind of like the shore
of a beach that leads out into

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-1
01:04:01.434 --> 01:04:05.631
the water. You do have some
little little rocks, clusters of

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-2
01:04:05.631 --> 01:04:10.034
rocks off on the side a little
bit further back in the picture,

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-3
01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:14.299
you're kind of looking straight
out of the water, but on each

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-4
01:04:14.299 --> 01:04:18.565
side of the water is is land.
It's a little bit more greenery

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-5
01:04:18.565 --> 01:04:22.968
than the beach that we have at
the bottom front of the picture,

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-6
01:04:22.968 --> 01:04:26.546
but you can see houses,
different houses off to the

e00cffca-52d6-44a7-a9f3-d21f11ceb1b8-7
01:04:26.546 --> 01:04:26.890
left.

83df189c-9235-4533-866e-6c526aadc116-0
01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.400
And to the right that are kind
of like waterfront homes.

d466a2f0-745d-4e4d-90a5-d7a0ee0697d2-0
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:34.543
In the distance you do see a
bunch of like sailboats and

d466a2f0-745d-4e4d-90a5-d7a0ee0697d2-1
01:04:34.543 --> 01:04:37.976
people out on boats in the
water. We do see people out at

d466a2f0-745d-4e4d-90a5-d7a0ee0697d2-2
01:04:37.976 --> 01:04:41.467
one of the houses. They're kind
of having like a grill out

d466a2f0-745d-4e4d-90a5-d7a0ee0697d2-3
01:04:41.467 --> 01:04:44.959
because you can see somebody
with a grill. They're sitting

d466a2f0-745d-4e4d-90a5-d7a0ee0697d2-4
01:04:44.959 --> 01:04:48.629
out at a picnic table and then
as they get closer down to the

d466a2f0-745d-4e4d-90a5-d7a0ee0697d2-5
01:04:48.629 --> 01:04:52.179
beach, obviously the beach is
filled with different people.

46e9afc9-1a5c-4cac-b633-7f26d5e74d86-0
01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:56.250
Kids. Adults. Men. Women.

11fa4399-d0d0-4208-94cd-4a67ee7d70f8-0
01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.332
There's a bunch of different,
uh, beach umbrellas people have

11fa4399-d0d0-4208-94cd-4a67ee7d70f8-1
01:05:01.332 --> 01:05:04.843
set up with like, beach chairs,
coolers, beach umbrellas.

11fa4399-d0d0-4208-94cd-4a67ee7d70f8-2
01:05:04.843 --> 01:05:08.778
There's off to the left, a game
of volleyball going. They've got

11fa4399-d0d0-4208-94cd-4a67ee7d70f8-3
01:05:08.778 --> 01:05:12.228
a volleyball net and they're
playing volleyball. There's

11fa4399-d0d0-4208-94cd-4a67ee7d70f8-4
01:05:12.228 --> 01:05:15.678
somebody, somebody flying a
kite, a kid who has a really

11fa4399-d0d0-4208-94cd-4a67ee7d70f8-5
01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:16.949
pretty colorful kite.

42ea7293-8ff9-4cb6-9c6f-42f38cfe0130-0
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.108
There is one boat that's kind of
up on the shore, and there's a

42ea7293-8ff9-4cb6-9c6f-42f38cfe0130-1
01:05:22.108 --> 01:05:25.851
man playing guitar, kind of
leaning against the boat. People

42ea7293-8ff9-4cb6-9c6f-42f38cfe0130-2
01:05:25.851 --> 01:05:29.227
are kind of sitting around
listening and watching him.

42ea7293-8ff9-4cb6-9c6f-42f38cfe0130-3
01:05:29.227 --> 01:05:32.910
There's some kids building. Let
me just move you for a SEC.

c0c52fbb-56d0-44d9-9b4a-8a4302602119-0
01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.720
There's some kids building.

1316c3fc-c5f7-4fb6-89b8-30883da87036-0
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.780
A sandcastle.

d64a951d-3a22-4881-b043-94594be70c44-0
01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:44.057
There's somebody in like a raft.
There is a little dock off of

d64a951d-3a22-4881-b043-94594be70c44-1
01:05:44.057 --> 01:05:48.044
the beach that leads over to the
water and there's some people

d64a951d-3a22-4881-b043-94594be70c44-2
01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:50.260
that are fishing off of that
dock.

a4764045-6c9e-42fc-8622-9da2ac310392-0
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:56.996
It looks like there's people on
rafts and canoes out on the

a4764045-6c9e-42fc-8622-9da2ac310392-1
01:05:56.996 --> 01:06:02.103
water. There's people on maybe
like jet skis, paddle boats,

a4764045-6c9e-42fc-8622-9da2ac310392-2
01:06:02.103 --> 01:06:06.700
kayaks. We see all different
kinds round inner tubes.

cd9e8ce0-64d2-4e06-a6a9-c9eaf3634891-0
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.360
But just all different kinds of.

Uh.

774dd6f8-f88d-4e60-9670-52780b195c00-0
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:17.242
What are the? I I guess there's
more sailboats up in the front,

774dd6f8-f88d-4e60-9670-52780b195c00-1
01:06:17.242 --> 01:06:19.370

kinds of.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:25.566
Water vehicles and and things
for the water. People are out in

61e5c8c5-49f3-4286-9ca9-c5d80ba8da7a-1
01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:30.208
the water enjoying themselves.
There's even a dog like on the

61e5c8c5-49f3-4286-9ca9-c5d80ba8da7a-2
01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:34.850
edge of the beach that's kind of
a happy to see its its human

61e5c8c5-49f3-4286-9ca9-c5d80ba8da7a-3
01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:38.220
person who's coming to hug it,
pool noodles.

9a8d42a2-45d4-40a4-9f27-f1a9f8caafaa-0
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:44.177
People in a lot of the people in
the boats are do have on life

9a8d42a2-45d4-40a4-9f27-f1a9f8caafaa-1
01:06:44.177 --> 01:06:45.950
vests, which is good.

6266d66f-1f2e-44ed-a8b1-798a7885e076-0
01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:51.110
And trying to think of what else
we can.

5027f1c8-4756-41a2-ae2b-ad5310b0d713-0
01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.610
I can kind of say about it.

4939285f-c1ed-4596-b6b7-ba1d1b48b548-0
01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:57.710
Uh.

cad20408-698c-48b9-8f0f-9b819358ed1a-0
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.146
There's a man and a woman kind
of holding hands, walking the

cad20408-698c-48b9-8f0f-9b819358ed1a-1
01:07:04.146 --> 01:07:09.070
beach. A kid with a net. People
sitting on the rocks and going

cad20408-698c-48b9-8f0f-9b819358ed1a-2
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:14.227
swimming. There is a swan over I
think it's a swan or a duck over

cad20408-698c-48b9-8f0f-9b819358ed1a-3
01:07:14.227 --> 01:07:17.510
in the and it's a swan over in
the water.

cd3dce2e-87e8-40a0-b0e2-f5f07a137ed4-0
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:22.878
Oh wait, I do see a Penguin. I
did find one Penguin, amazingly

cd3dce2e-87e8-40a0-b0e2-f5f07a137ed4-1
01:07:22.878 --> 01:07:23.310
enough.

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-0
01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:29.507
Oh, and then there are there's a
couple like teams. It looks like

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-1
01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:33.705
maybe there's a a rowing team on
a boat that has like a dragon

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-2
01:07:33.705 --> 01:07:37.769
kind of like head. And then
there's also people who are like

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-3
01:07:37.769 --> 01:07:41.567
water skiing and they are
forming a pyramid. So there is

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-4
01:07:41.567 --> 01:07:45.698
12345678, there's nine on the
bottom, there's six on the that

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-5
01:07:45.698 --> 01:07:49.829
they're holding up above them,
three on top of them, and then

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-6
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:54.093
two and then one person all the
way up. So that's kind of cool.

07534356-4665-4f30-a4a5-932b585dfed9-7
01:07:54.093 --> 01:07:55.160
#END_by_the_lake

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.180
OK. Yeah, we're good. OK, the
next one.

6dcb7f7e-da2d-4f9a-9ba0-7bf0b2b92fbe-0
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:05.440
It's a story, so OK.

0c2fcb90-77ed-4160-8321-90b327e80589-0
01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:10.077
And I'll go through the pages.
So tell the story, what you see

0c2fcb90-77ed-4160-8321-90b327e80589-1
01:08:10.077 --> 01:08:12.890
and what is happening. Let me go
through it.

1622614b-62df-4605-9bcc-25e0b95ab059-0
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.262
#START_return OK, so I know
we've seen this story before.

1622614b-62df-4605-9bcc-25e0b95ab059-1
01:08:19.262 --> 01:08:24.718
This one's titled for my parents
and it's another most kind of

1622614b-62df-4605-9bcc-25e0b95ab059-2
01:08:24.718 --> 01:08:30.000
looks like a water colored.
It's, it's kind of predominantly

1622614b-62df-4605-9bcc-25e0b95ab059-3
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.283
brown and white, but it's more
less charcoal and more like a

1622614b-62df-4605-9bcc-25e0b95ab059-4
01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:40.738
watercolor and it's on the left
hand side we see the, we see a

1622614b-62df-4605-9bcc-25e0b95ab059-5
01:08:40.738 --> 01:08:43.510
small sreet, we see the edge of.

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-0
01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.568
The like an apartment building.
We see some bigger size scrapers

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-1
01:08:48.568 --> 01:08:52.779
and buildings off in the
distance with some trees, some

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-2
01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:57.517
stop sign or I'm sorry, street
signs and stop lights. And then

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-3
01:08:57.517 --> 01:09:02.180
we see this one particular house
or building and it's got the

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-4
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.617
front steps or four steps. But
we see as if you've cut the

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-5
01:09:06.617 --> 01:09:11.355
house open in half, we can see
the inside of the House and the

c0033648-47ad-41d6-b743-61495889bcbb-6
01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:14.740
different rooms. So when you
enter into the.

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-0
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.357
Apartment or the residents.
You've got the main little like

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-1
01:09:19.357 --> 01:09:23.707
foyer area. There's like a coat
rack. There's a doorway that

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-2
01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:28.127
leads up to a stairwell. There's
a mirror on the wall, little

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-3
01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:32.191
hall table with a lamp and a
plant. Some pictures on the

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-4
01:09:32.191 --> 01:09:36.327
wall. The room behind that is
the kitchen. We can see the

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-5
01:09:36.327 --> 01:09:40.747
cabinets, we can see the sink,
the oven. There's a oven, vent

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-6
01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:45.310
hood drawers. Behind that is a
little hallway that has a set of

342c6db8-d51d-4ebd-9b2a-c49fd733bb5e-7
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:45.809
stairs.

c8345b65-984d-49b9-a131-586fa95e20e0-0
01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:49.540
And on the other side of that
wall is.

3f40ef60-5b9b-4ca3-bbc3-575efed1e32a-0
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:52.970
The door to a bedroom.

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-0
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:59.491
And that particular bedroom is
that of a little girl who has a

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-1
01:09:59.491 --> 01:10:04.631
red crayon. And even though the
pic the main picture, is kind of

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-2
01:10:04.631 --> 01:10:09.059
brown and white, she is in
color. And anything that she

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-3
01:10:09.059 --> 01:10:14.120
draws with the red crayon is in
color. She also has, let's see,

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-4
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.181
she's got her bed and a map of
the world on the wall. There's a

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-5
01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:24.083
window, a dresser. She's got a
little lamp and a wastebasket.

c27520ca-c501-4eef-bd5d-36d4b8c47450-6
01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:24.399
She.

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-0
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:28.327
It looks like she's drawn like a
little hot air balloon and I

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-1
01:10:28.327 --> 01:10:32.226
forget what this something else
that's purple. There's a couple

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-2
01:10:32.226 --> 01:10:35.943
items that are purple on the bed
I can't make out, but she's

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-3
01:10:35.943 --> 01:10:39.660
currently holding a red ball and
she is drawing a red arched

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-4
01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:43.071
doorway on the wall to her
bedroom. And then real quick

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-5
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:46.971
above her bedroom is on the 2nd
floor is a little bathroom. You

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-6
01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:50.200
can see a pedestal sink, a
mirror, some pictures and

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-7
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.795
lights. On the other side of
that it appears that there is

573df781-03d3-40bf-8cf8-37fea6bfdd84-8
01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:54.769
another bedroom.

4d7798e0-bac3-4283-baf8-ec39f37266c9-0
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.783
You can see an Ottoman with the
cat sleeping on it and the

4d7798e0-bac3-4283-baf8-ec39f37266c9-1
01:10:58.783 --> 01:11:00.120
window. Then we see.

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-0
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:06.106
Uh, two other rooms. One's like
a little living area we can. We

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-1
01:11:06.106 --> 01:11:10.543
see a couch and a TV, pictures
on the wall. And then that front

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-2
01:11:10.543 --> 01:11:14.495
room is a man who is in his
office. He's got a bookshelf

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-3
01:11:14.495 --> 01:11:18.724
with books on it. He's got a
picture hanging on the wall. He

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-4
01:11:18.724 --> 01:11:22.953
has one of those, like, little
art desks. Umm, I forget what

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-5
01:11:22.953 --> 01:11:27.182
they're called, but they they
move kind of like an easel. It

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-6
01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:30.718
kind of moves. And he is
drawing. He's got a light

de449797-a2b4-449d-b123-ad5fa93a9348-7
01:11:30.718 --> 01:11:32.590
overhead and he is drawing.

73f16e8b-c5b8-493c-855e-dc5fed1584d1-0
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:35.923
On that art board. But the
little girl is down in her

73f16e8b-c5b8-493c-855e-dc5fed1584d1-1
01:11:35.923 --> 01:11:39.589
bedroom. She is drawing a red
door and we will see where that

73f16e8b-c5b8-493c-855e-dc5fed1584d1-2
01:11:39.589 --> 01:11:40.239
door leads.

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-0
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:46.846
Oh, oh, I guess I forgot to
mention the man who is drawing

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-1
01:11:46.846 --> 01:11:51.062
in his little Art Room, there
was a red kite that was drawn

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-2
01:11:51.062 --> 01:11:55.419
and left behind in that room. So
in the next scene we see the

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-3
01:11:55.419 --> 01:11:59.636
man, but we're really focusing
on him at his his art table.

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-4
01:11:59.636 --> 01:12:03.993
He's sitting on his stool at the
art table, and he looks back

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-5
01:12:03.993 --> 01:12:08.139
behind him and he sees the red
kite. So he gets off of the

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-6
01:12:08.139 --> 01:12:12.426
stool, he goes down, he picks up
the kite and looks a little

6bc62a3b-4f06-4129-aa01-d832be8d7b01-7
01:12:12.426 --> 01:12:13.269
inquisitive.

b53a1c9b-eec7-419c-9f7e-b15407fad8dc-0
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:17.497
And then we see he leaves the
kite on the floor and then we

b53a1c9b-eec7-419c-9f7e-b15407fad8dc-1
01:12:17.497 --> 01:12:21.713
see him in the bedroom of the
little girl, and there the red

b53a1c9b-eec7-419c-9f7e-b15407fad8dc-2
01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:25.999
door that she has drawn is now
open and he is kind of peering

b53a1c9b-eec7-419c-9f7e-b15407fad8dc-3
01:12:25.999 --> 01:12:29.870
down through that door to see
what's on the other side.

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-0
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:37.329
And when he comes through that
red door onto the other side, he

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-1
01:12:37.329 --> 01:12:41.323
enters the forest with all of
the there's all these really,

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-2
01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:45.516
really tall trees, and there are
lanterns, these really pretty

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-3
01:12:45.516 --> 01:12:49.643
lanterns, kind of like Chinese
lanterns hanging down with the

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-4
01:12:49.643 --> 01:12:53.903
like tassels at the bottom. And
they're just really cool shapes

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-5
01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:58.296
and designs, and they're kind of
hanging from the trees, lighting

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-6
01:12:58.296 --> 01:13:01.890
it up. There's also string
lights, like little string

f52dea70-0cfe-4028-9e66-ebd06602125c-7
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:02.290
globe.

13055a71-9c39-4805-a31f-be4c303c57c6-0
01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:06.659
Sites that are hanging from the
trees to help light it up, as

13055a71-9c39-4805-a31f-be4c303c57c6-1
01:13:06.659 --> 01:13:10.611
well as these little yellow
orbs, but it looks like they

13055a71-9c39-4805-a31f-be4c303c57c6-2
01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:14.841
might be like lightning bugs.
And the man comes out, he does

13055a71-9c39-4805-a31f-be4c303c57c6-3
01:13:14.841 --> 01:13:19.209
see the water in the center. On
the other side of the water is

13055a71-9c39-4805-a31f-be4c303c57c6-4
01:13:19.209 --> 01:13:23.647
this red ball that's sitting on
like a dock, like a wooden dock

13055a71-9c39-4805-a31f-be4c303c57c6-5
01:13:23.647 --> 01:13:25.449
that hangs over the water.

05964e7d-3639-49ce-801b-a2445d773c1b-0
01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:32.234
And the man crosses, somehow
crosses the water. He picks up

05964e7d-3639-49ce-801b-a2445d773c1b-1
01:13:32.234 --> 01:13:36.447
the red ball. He's standing on
the edge of the dock and he's

05964e7d-3639-49ce-801b-a2445d773c1b-2
01:13:36.447 --> 01:13:40.798
looking over and there is this,
this boat, this big kind of, I

05964e7d-3639-49ce-801b-a2445d773c1b-3
01:13:40.798 --> 01:13:45.357
don't know what that looks like,
maybe like it kind of looks like

05964e7d-3639-49ce-801b-a2445d773c1b-4
01:13:45.357 --> 01:13:48.119
a deer, like the the head and
the face.

be8d0226-93ab-4c59-8274-4e8d105611a9-0
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:53.704
Looks like a deer. It has a
green eye and then it goes down

be8d0226-93ab-4c59-8274-4e8d105611a9-1
01:13:53.704 --> 01:13:57.750
and it has. It goes down to the
base of the boat and it's.

e2ebf435-8320-4a68-897d-fdd8bd607328-0
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:01.720
The back of it is like a tail.
It's almost like a.

ca6d016e-a349-4e12-8e6b-0a93bdb06efd-0
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:07.711
Like a webbed foot, like you
would find on like an amphibian,

ca6d016e-a349-4e12-8e6b-0a93bdb06efd-1
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:12.366
like a wet web or a webbed foot
of some sort. But it's, it's

ca6d016e-a349-4e12-8e6b-0a93bdb06efd-2
01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:17.097
kind of curved and that's the
back part of this boat. And the

ca6d016e-a349-4e12-8e6b-0a93bdb06efd-3
01:14:17.097 --> 01:14:21.829
man. So the boat comes along the
dock, the man hops on to the

ca6d016e-a349-4e12-8e6b-0a93bdb06efd-4
01:14:21.829 --> 01:14:24.500
boat with his red ball and is
off.

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-0
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:32.149
And this this little boat takes
him to the castle. We've I'm

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-1
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:36.194
pretty sure we've seen this
castle before as well and

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-2
01:14:36.194 --> 01:14:40.988
there's like wooden doors that
open on the waterway it's like a

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-3
01:14:40.988 --> 01:14:45.483
little canal and the boat is
taking him through these doors

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-4
01:14:45.483 --> 01:14:49.977
and under the it's it's it's I
guess it's not a castle it's

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-5
01:14:49.977 --> 01:14:54.472
like castle like structure but
it's really like a a city so

600b35d2-3874-478f-8e5b-66eaf9db414e-6
01:14:54.472 --> 01:14:56.569
there's different buildings.

a63444ec-74f8-4648-9ccc-8da56f5ba2bc-0
01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:57.090
Umm.

8eb41065-f0ce-4c8e-84fd-772eb9dbf6bd-0
01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:02.909
So he's going into this little
city through the wooden doors

8eb41065-f0ce-4c8e-84fd-772eb9dbf6bd-1
01:15:02.909 --> 01:15:03.440
and he.

1e47443c-7116-47fc-8ed6-b9a2e6ead560-0
01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.935
The next scene we can see on one
of the bridges leading to the

1e47443c-7116-47fc-8ed6-b9a2e6ead560-1
01:15:09.935 --> 01:15:13.966
other side of the city, the
little girl, and she is in a

1e47443c-7116-47fc-8ed6-b9a2e6ead560-2
01:15:13.966 --> 01:15:18.492
little like red, like a little
red rowboat that she's traveling

1e47443c-7116-47fc-8ed6-b9a2e6ead560-3
01:15:18.492 --> 01:15:20.190
through on the waterway.

ee140135-fb1b-48bf-8c63-c072207c6d94-0
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:28.850
We then see the boat kind of
dock at.

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-0
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:36.475
At I guess at the dock center
and in front of when he, the man

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-1
01:15:36.475 --> 01:15:41.440
exits the boat, he does leave
the red ball behind. We can see

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-2
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.324
the little girl's red little
rowboat has been left behind in

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-3
01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:51.209
the waterway and we can see
little girl heading up the steps

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-4
01:15:51.209 --> 01:15:56.174
to where the little boy is. And
then that older man that they

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-5
01:15:56.174 --> 01:16:00.739
met that time under the bridge
is there with this little

d01bfcde-940b-42bb-b332-d1e469daa961-6
01:16:00.739 --> 01:16:01.300
purple.

716267ed-748e-465f-a9f9-9fbf91566aa5-0
01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:02.100
Uh.

5a64626f-a416-45c0-8ab6-cfaa67c6d82e-0
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:07.974
Like, hawk. Like not a hawk, but
like a, I guess like a hawk. And

5a64626f-a416-45c0-8ab6-cfaa67c6d82e-1
01:16:07.974 --> 01:16:12.824
there are people on each side of
the waterway kind of dressed in

5a64626f-a416-45c0-8ab6-cfaa67c6d82e-2
01:16:12.824 --> 01:16:17.375
military uniforms, and they're
holding trumpets. And the man

5a64626f-a416-45c0-8ab6-cfaa67c6d82e-3
01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:22.300
and the boy are waiting to greet
this girl, and this other man is

5a64626f-a416-45c0-8ab6-cfaa67c6d82e-4
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:26.180
kind of running after her. And
then we see the man.

c7d9210e-78aa-49dd-a1e6-507af1518ae6-0
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:34.245
Go up, we can see that there is
like a royal chair that has

c7d9210e-78aa-49dd-a1e6-507af1518ae6-1
01:16:34.245 --> 01:16:35.500
three seats.

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-0
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:41.036
And little girl has got her arms
crossed and she's staring at the

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-1
01:16:41.036 --> 01:16:45.001
chair. Little boy is behind her.
He's got his purple pen and the

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-2
01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:48.844
little bird on his shoulder. And
then the older man is kind of

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-3
01:16:48.844 --> 01:16:52.687
back looking at them. And then
this other man kind of comes up

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-4
01:16:52.687 --> 01:16:56.286
to them. And the little boy,
little girl and the older man

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-5
01:16:56.286 --> 01:17:00.190
are all three wearing a crown.
And so this is like a royal seat

fe041ef0-87d4-47c7-a5a7-2b37c4939bbc-6
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:00.740
for them.

5a07438a-5999-4cd0-8f30-810f8ef8757c-0
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:09.088
We then can see and they're on.
They're under like a, like a

5a07438a-5999-4cd0-8f30-810f8ef8757c-1
01:17:09.088 --> 01:17:13.947
pergola. It's like a there's a
top structure to it, but it's

5a07438a-5999-4cd0-8f30-810f8ef8757c-2
01:17:13.947 --> 01:17:18.886
not enclosed at all. It's kind
of open aired. We can see then

5a07438a-5999-4cd0-8f30-810f8ef8757c-3
01:17:18.886 --> 01:17:20.320
on the other side.

71b73208-084a-4ad8-a9bc-d72715fefaaa-0
01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:28.361
This another kind of like a deer
boat that brings a different man

71b73208-084a-4ad8-a9bc-d72715fefaaa-1
01:17:28.361 --> 01:17:33.727
who's in like body armor and I'm
pretty sure we've seen him

71b73208-084a-4ad8-a9bc-d72715fefaaa-2
01:17:33.727 --> 01:17:36.410
before as well. He's carrying.

06411796-1fd9-464d-980d-0651abc6fe8f-0
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:42.581
I feel like it's a cage of some
sort anyway. The two young kids,

06411796-1fd9-464d-980d-0651abc6fe8f-1
01:17:42.581 --> 01:17:46.358
little boy, little girl, the
older man, and then the

06411796-1fd9-464d-980d-0651abc6fe8f-2
01:17:46.358 --> 01:17:47.000
neighbor.

b0e5d4f7-5b19-4adf-bc2f-772c27e05698-0
01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:51.981
All appear startled and
frightened by this man. And we

b0e5d4f7-5b19-4adf-bc2f-772c27e05698-1
01:17:51.981 --> 01:17:56.506
can see in the next picture that
this guy, this man with the body

b0e5d4f7-5b19-4adf-bc2f-772c27e05698-2
01:17:56.506 --> 01:18:00.826
armor, and he has, he has like a
crew that also has body armor

b0e5d4f7-5b19-4adf-bc2f-772c27e05698-3
01:18:00.826 --> 01:18:03.980
and daggers and they're running
up the steps.

1a5cfe4b-0a05-45f2-bd2a-3cf720aa9dc3-0
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:09.665
Towards them we see the older
man with his arm outstretched up

1a5cfe4b-0a05-45f2-bd2a-3cf720aa9dc3-1
01:18:09.665 --> 01:18:13.813
in the air. He is holding his
orange crayon and he is holding

1a5cfe4b-0a05-45f2-bd2a-3cf720aa9dc3-2
01:18:13.813 --> 01:18:17.961
a little boy behind him and the
little girl, and the bird and

1a5cfe4b-0a05-45f2-bd2a-3cf720aa9dc3-3
01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:20.370
the other man are back behind
them.

b937b54e-abd8-4c2f-8f71-d3c4e2654993-0
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.533
Now we can see the man drawing
with his orange crayon a line

b937b54e-abd8-4c2f-8f71-d3c4e2654993-1
01:18:29.533 --> 01:18:34.427
from the air from as far he had
had his arm up, and he's now

b937b54e-abd8-4c2f-8f71-d3c4e2654993-2
01:18:34.427 --> 01:18:39.001
drawing it down and everybody
else is behind him. And we

b937b54e-abd8-4c2f-8f71-d3c4e2654993-3
01:18:39.001 --> 01:18:44.055
realize that he is drawing like
a sword of some sort. And then

b937b54e-abd8-4c2f-8f71-d3c4e2654993-4
01:18:44.055 --> 01:18:48.708
we see he's at the top of the
stairs, we see him with the

b937b54e-abd8-4c2f-8f71-d3c4e2654993-5
01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:52.640
sword, but we see this other man
with this body.

5a20c1b8-5590-4228-bc3d-e5ca9969adb0-0
01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:57.555
Armor and he's carrying. I
thought it was a cage, but it's

5a20c1b8-5590-4228-bc3d-e5ca9969adb0-1
01:18:57.555 --> 01:19:02.564
it's a box of some sort and it
has like a crank arm that you

5a20c1b8-5590-4228-bc3d-e5ca9969adb0-2
01:19:02.564 --> 01:19:07.656
would turn on the right hand
side and then it opens up on the

5a20c1b8-5590-4228-bc3d-e5ca9969adb0-3
01:19:07.656 --> 01:19:11.269
front, kind of like an old style
camera or.

8907a3e7-a68e-403b-a0f8-e6d18a8ccf3f-0
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:18.305
Yeah, like an old style camera
box. But we see in the picture

8907a3e7-a68e-403b-a0f8-e6d18a8ccf3f-1
01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:23.458
that the man this box, what it
does is it grabs the crayons

8907a3e7-a68e-403b-a0f8-e6d18a8ccf3f-2
01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:28.698
that the man had holstered in.
He had that belt holstered on

8907a3e7-a68e-403b-a0f8-e6d18a8ccf3f-3
01:19:28.698 --> 01:19:34.023
his chest like across his body
with the different crayons. We

8907a3e7-a68e-403b-a0f8-e6d18a8ccf3f-4
01:19:34.023 --> 01:19:39.262
see this box when the man cranks
the arm on it, it draws the

8907a3e7-a68e-403b-a0f8-e6d18a8ccf3f-5
01:19:39.262 --> 01:19:42.870
crayons out of the possession of
the man.

848c068c-93fa-4f4c-9a15-e20fc944c020-0
01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:47.696
So we see the blue crayon go in
the green, the yellow, and even

848c068c-93fa-4f4c-9a15-e20fc944c020-1
01:19:47.696 --> 01:19:51.758
the orange crayon from the man,
as well as the sword, this

848c068c-93fa-4f4c-9a15-e20fc944c020-2
01:19:51.758 --> 01:19:56.096
orange sword that he drew. And
this box is like sucking it up,

848c068c-93fa-4f4c-9a15-e20fc944c020-3
01:19:56.096 --> 01:20:00.433
almost kind of like a vacuum.
And then we see some of his, the

848c068c-93fa-4f4c-9a15-e20fc944c020-4
01:20:00.433 --> 01:20:04.496
crew members that are also
dressed in body armor with like

848c068c-93fa-4f4c-9a15-e20fc944c020-5
01:20:04.496 --> 01:20:05.460
these daggers.

cc5a454d-e26a-409d-961c-b1be36446412-0
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:11.237
Take the older man and they they
grab him and they have

cc5a454d-e26a-409d-961c-b1be36446412-1
01:20:11.237 --> 01:20:16.037
possession of him and he is
reaching back to the others, but

cc5a454d-e26a-409d-961c-b1be36446412-2
01:20:16.037 --> 01:20:20.760
the man with the box and the
body armor is running towards.

706e5cec-76dc-4d59-a3a2-79aaec1cc352-0
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.350
The two kids and the neighbor.

0bebd601-e19c-4dad-b2fa-84d215509795-0
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:31.446
Um, but then we see the little
boy pull out his purple crayon

0bebd601-e19c-4dad-b2fa-84d215509795-1
01:20:31.446 --> 01:20:36.252
and he begins to draw what
appears to be like a wing. And

0bebd601-e19c-4dad-b2fa-84d215509795-2
01:20:36.252 --> 01:20:41.472
we can see the neighbor behind
him, the little girl and little

0bebd601-e19c-4dad-b2fa-84d215509795-3
01:20:41.472 --> 01:20:46.608
purple bird, or standing right
behind him and in the distance

0bebd601-e19c-4dad-b2fa-84d215509795-4
01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:51.580
we see this man with the box
running towards them. But then

0bebd601-e19c-4dad-b2fa-84d215509795-5
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.060
we see that the little boy, the
neighbor.

2504f2b2-5f0a-4753-8f4d-92087d7300c6-0
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:59.053
Little girl and the purple bird
have made it onto this creature

2504f2b2-5f0a-4753-8f4d-92087d7300c6-1
01:20:59.053 --> 01:21:02.679
that the little boy has drawn.
It's a purple, kind of like a

2504f2b2-5f0a-4753-8f4d-92087d7300c6-2
01:21:02.679 --> 01:21:03.690
Pegasus creature.

4e6acea9-8435-4b25-b6dd-55fa68ad7fdc-0
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:09.520
I guess kind of like that it's
got wings, like a Pegasus, and

4e6acea9-8435-4b25-b6dd-55fa68ad7fdc-1
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.531
this creature is carrying them
off. It can fly because it has

4e6acea9-8435-4b25-b6dd-55fa68ad7fdc-2
01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:17.671
wings, so it's carrying them off
into the sky, and the man with

4e6acea9-8435-4b25-b6dd-55fa68ad7fdc-3
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:20.969
the box and the body armor is at
the edge of this.

09565440-7d14-4b83-90fa-b54030656727-0
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.820
He's like at the edge of the.

2c41dd1f-c65c-4f0b-ad8e-62dc6f979f6a-0
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.650
God, my words are escaping me
tonight.

784594d6-5425-4351-b5c4-2fa680371891-0
01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:37.044
It's like a, I guess like a like
a balcony or a railing for the

784594d6-5425-4351-b5c4-2fa680371891-1
01:21:37.044 --> 01:21:41.147
the curved balcony and he's like
standing up there trying to

784594d6-5425-4351-b5c4-2fa680371891-2
01:21:41.147 --> 01:21:45.116
reach after them, but they are
in front of him and able to

784594d6-5425-4351-b5c4-2fa680371891-3
01:21:45.116 --> 01:21:48.210
escape him and they're flying
over the water.

a604e2f5-c49a-4176-beab-6ec5944b29fb-0
01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:54.377
We then see, uh, the three of
them riding this purple Pegasus

a604e2f5-c49a-4176-beab-6ec5944b29fb-1
01:21:54.377 --> 01:21:59.195
and we can see the man and his
crew do have this older man kind

a604e2f5-c49a-4176-beab-6ec5944b29fb-2
01:21:59.195 --> 01:22:03.787
of taken hostage. They're back
on this little boat. It's the

a604e2f5-c49a-4176-beab-6ec5944b29fb-3
01:22:03.787 --> 01:22:07.100
it's kind of the deer boat with
the webbed.

68fc1f0e-3c76-4960-bdea-5db248e25356-0
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:13.547
Background and they're flying
behind them and the man has the

68fc1f0e-3c76-4960-bdea-5db248e25356-1
01:22:13.547 --> 01:22:18.706
box and he's cranking it and he
is trying to suck the purple in

68fc1f0e-3c76-4960-bdea-5db248e25356-2
01:22:18.706 --> 01:22:23.704
the back part of this Pegasus
into the box so that the animal

68fc1f0e-3c76-4960-bdea-5db248e25356-3
01:22:23.704 --> 01:22:28.702
will disappear and he can get
them and they're they're flying

68fc1f0e-3c76-4960-bdea-5db248e25356-4
01:22:28.702 --> 01:22:33.700
high above bridges and open sea
water and above the the town.

fa9f1978-ef3f-4750-bba4-251c23d7e0e5-0
01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:46.413
Oh boy. Next thing we know, we
see a lot of feathers. We see a

fa9f1978-ef3f-4750-bba4-251c23d7e0e5-1
01:22:46.413 --> 01:22:52.226
lot of feathers in the sky, and
we can see that the man with the

fa9f1978-ef3f-4750-bba4-251c23d7e0e5-2
01:22:52.226 --> 01:22:57.324
box has been able to kind of
suction in or vacuum in the

fa9f1978-ef3f-4750-bba4-251c23d7e0e5-3
01:22:57.324 --> 01:23:03.047
majority of this Pegasus animal.
And all that's left behind are

fa9f1978-ef3f-4750-bba4-251c23d7e0e5-4
01:23:03.047 --> 01:23:04.210
these purple.

ae74aefb-938c-406f-a2fe-fe756b62f47f-0
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.160
Feathers, we do see that.

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-0
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:13.313
The little boy, because they
have, because the animal is

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-1
01:23:13.313 --> 01:23:17.814
gone, they're kind of free
floating in the air. We do see

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-2
01:23:17.814 --> 01:23:22.470
that the little boy is able to
grab a hold of the older man

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-3
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:27.514
who's on the back of this deer,
deer ship, flying deer ship, and

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-4
01:23:27.514 --> 01:23:32.170
the older man is leaning over
holding on to the little boy.

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-5
01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:37.137
Then we see the little girl with
the neighbor and he is holding

e6918144-f490-494d-b3b9-988fab773b70-6
01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:39.000
on to her wrist but her.

053c1a21-0a12-4809-b1e1-2fac7777136c-0
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:42.781
Crown is coming off of her head
now. She does still have the

053c1a21-0a12-4809-b1e1-2fac7777136c-1
01:23:42.781 --> 01:23:45.580
bird, and she does still have
her red crayon.

bc371460-4b61-4903-99f1-98808f020c51-0
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:52.019
And we see them. Those two, the
neighbor and little girl, fall

bc371460-4b61-4903-99f1-98808f020c51-1
01:23:52.019 --> 01:23:53.060
into the water.

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-0
01:23:54.450 --> 01:23:57.490
You can see there's like a
little bit of an under

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-1
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:01.321
underwater city with some some
greenery and plants, sea plants

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-2
01:24:01.321 --> 01:24:04.969
that's under there. We do see
little like goldfish that are

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-3
01:24:04.969 --> 01:24:08.617
kind of swimming through, but
they kind of plunge down into

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-4
01:24:08.617 --> 01:24:12.509
the water both the neighbor and
little and the purple bird. She

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-5
01:24:12.509 --> 01:24:16.461
does take her red crayon though
and the Crown also sinks down to

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-6
01:24:16.461 --> 01:24:19.867
the bottom. Sorry, I forgot
that. The Crown you can see

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-7
01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:23.697
sinking down to the bottom of
the sea floor, but she pulls out

8debe338-8964-4548-b972-5040b870018a-8
01:24:23.697 --> 01:24:24.610
her red crayon.

bc8c86a8-23d0-4574-8dfb-b4bb21a76662-0
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:30.183
And she begins to make
something. It's like 2/3 of the

bc8c86a8-23d0-4574-8dfb-b4bb21a76662-1
01:24:30.183 --> 01:24:36.154
way, the shape of an Oval like
pill, but then on the other end

bc8c86a8-23d0-4574-8dfb-b4bb21a76662-2
01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:40.420
it becomes a harder, more
triangular shaped.

a942372c-2700-4155-9ee2-6c7ecf44abf7-0
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:48.795
Shape. I don't know. I don't
know what it is yet. OK, now we

a942372c-2700-4155-9ee2-6c7ecf44abf7-1
01:24:48.795 --> 01:24:50.610
see a picture with.

0d6f9528-1946-49fe-84f5-6fa5bcc04fa4-0
01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.472
I don't know what that is. I
think it's just supposed to be

0d6f9528-1946-49fe-84f5-6fa5bcc04fa4-1
01:24:56.472 --> 01:25:00.836
one big picture and it's below
the water. We can again still

0d6f9528-1946-49fe-84f5-6fa5bcc04fa4-2
01:25:00.836 --> 01:25:05.486
see the sea floor and plants and
little fish and everything, but

0d6f9528-1946-49fe-84f5-6fa5bcc04fa4-3
01:25:05.486 --> 01:25:09.850
what the girl has has drawn is
kind of like a red submarine.

6f29d0fa-ee31-4afa-9da7-f38b3ebbff2c-0
01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:16.060
And we can kind of see as if it
was cut in half. We can kind of

6f29d0fa-ee31-4afa-9da7-f38b3ebbff2c-1
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.482
see the inside of it. We have
the girl on the top half where

6f29d0fa-ee31-4afa-9da7-f38b3ebbff2c-2
01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:25.122
there is a feeling that I need
to study submarines now. There's

6f29d0fa-ee31-4afa-9da7-f38b3ebbff2c-3
01:25:25.122 --> 01:25:26.210
some kind of a.

fe0e00a6-4ff0-4ba7-8130-824970a14fe1-0
01:25:27.450 --> 01:25:28.480
A little.

9ef3ee00-8c80-42a1-8fe7-dcd693a233ca-0
01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.030
Oh boy. What do you call those?

d5832919-b815-4855-9d98-7b627fba1cd4-0
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.830
The piece that sticks up outside
of the water.

0c0c1478-21ff-4352-ae4a-e31e6b7a0c76-0
01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:42.111
And she's operating that I would
imagine. So that they have some

0c0c1478-21ff-4352-ae4a-e31e6b7a0c76-1
01:25:42.111 --> 01:25:46.410
kind of has something to do with
the air. It does have a

0c0c1478-21ff-4352-ae4a-e31e6b7a0c76-2
01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:51.237
propeller in the back, so it's
propelling to move along. In the

0c0c1478-21ff-4352-ae4a-e31e6b7a0c76-3
01:25:51.237 --> 01:25:56.139
front part of the like submarine
is the little purple bird. It's

0c0c1478-21ff-4352-ae4a-e31e6b7a0c76-4
01:25:56.139 --> 01:26:00.588
controlling something. And in
the main section we have the

0c0c1478-21ff-4352-ae4a-e31e6b7a0c76-5
01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:04.510
neighbor who is sitting down
controlling something.

4a661360-153b-4950-94c8-9f506b214cbb-0
01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:13.222
Then we're able to see the
submarine. It is kind of like

4a661360-153b-4950-94c8-9f506b214cbb-1
01:26:13.222 --> 01:26:17.679
docked up on a little like cave.
It's come to like this little

4a661360-153b-4950-94c8-9f506b214cbb-2
01:26:17.679 --> 01:26:22.206
cave area and there's a bunch of
rocks and so they kind of pull

4a661360-153b-4950-94c8-9f506b214cbb-3
01:26:22.206 --> 01:26:26.734
over to the rocks and and stop
they get out of the from the top

4a661360-153b-4950-94c8-9f506b214cbb-4
01:26:26.734 --> 01:26:31.049
of the submarine. So they're
standing on the very top of the

4a661360-153b-4950-94c8-9f506b214cbb-5
01:26:31.049 --> 01:26:32.959
submarine and they can see.

c2de2d5e-ffad-4c04-88e8-a335d311e574-0
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:36.320
I guess what appears to be.

49c58110-e0f3-4ed9-bc76-5d2059c06c67-0
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:42.483
Drawings or writings that are
carved into the stone or drawn

49c58110-e0f3-4ed9-bc76-5d2059c06c67-1
01:26:42.483 --> 01:26:43.490
on the stone.

28d21068-1e12-4fcf-ae57-e47b1bff005b-0
01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.410
Kind of like hieroglyphics.

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-0
01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:53.439
But it's pictures of looks like
pictures of people, primarily

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-1
01:26:53.439 --> 01:26:58.069
women, that I see. Maybe there's
a man here and there too and

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-2
01:26:58.069 --> 01:27:02.698
kids. There's also some other
shapes. I'm not quite sure what

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-3
01:27:02.698 --> 01:27:07.179
they are, but there's some
shapes that looks like some like

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-4
01:27:07.179 --> 01:27:11.584
maybe doors or some boats that
are drawn on there. I'm not

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-5
01:27:11.584 --> 01:27:15.617
quite sure exactly what the
scene is saying, but it's

4ab86c97-a22a-40df-97dc-db392862b3f3-6
01:27:15.617 --> 01:27:18.380
definitely a a picture scene
within.

0ffa9adc-ff2d-43de-b5fc-bb2468019a60-0
01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:23.020
The stone, and they're kind of
peering up looking at that.

af2b6b7f-9a63-4082-b18a-308a6c8c7acf-0
01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.557
Um, they get off of the
submarine. They kind of walk in

af2b6b7f-9a63-4082-b18a-308a6c8c7acf-1
01:27:27.557 --> 01:27:29.870
more towards a little bit into
The Cave.

5ae6a80e-4ccb-49a8-81b0-6fcd524c03a1-0
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.830
And the girl is pointing up at,
oh, the little girl's pointing

5ae6a80e-4ccb-49a8-81b0-6fcd524c03a1-1
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:41.060
up at one of the picture scenes.
And you can see she's showing

5ae6a80e-4ccb-49a8-81b0-6fcd524c03a1-2
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:46.124
the neighbor and the bird is
kind of behind them, perched on

5ae6a80e-4ccb-49a8-81b0-6fcd524c03a1-3
01:27:46.124 --> 01:27:51.437
something. You can see there is
the drawing of a person holding

5ae6a80e-4ccb-49a8-81b0-6fcd524c03a1-4
01:27:51.437 --> 01:27:56.169
a crayon, and another person
with this box in the box is

5ae6a80e-4ccb-49a8-81b0-6fcd524c03a1-5
01:27:56.169 --> 01:28:00.570
sucking whatever has been drawn
from the crayon, so.

eea413aa-c061-4351-8408-341500fa66d8-0
01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:04.599
Kind of a picture depicting
exactly what they just went

eea413aa-c061-4351-8408-341500fa66d8-1
01:28:04.599 --> 01:28:09.031
through. Is is inside this cave.
There's also a little doorway

eea413aa-c061-4351-8408-341500fa66d8-2
01:28:09.031 --> 01:28:10.720
inside The Cave as well.

0550a660-6e71-4e29-b5ca-0dbbe054c286-0
01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:13.890
Um.

31fa2fb8-b185-402c-8024-c589ee5c7e20-0
01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.090
Once these, ohh once they.

651bb6a9-0cf1-4c11-b93e-8c396a189d77-0
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.133
After they see this picture,
they turn around and they

651bb6a9-0cf1-4c11-b93e-8c396a189d77-1
01:28:23.133 --> 01:28:23.950
realize that.

61466be6-b425-49d6-bb6a-2eac3d3e3679-0
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:30.330
The deer boat ship has come upon
this cave as well. There's

61466be6-b425-49d6-bb6a-2eac3d3e3679-1
01:28:30.330 --> 01:28:35.332
still, I still see the see think
I see the little boy and the

61466be6-b425-49d6-bb6a-2eac3d3e3679-2
01:28:35.332 --> 01:28:40.334
older man on the back. They're
both kind of like prisoners on

61466be6-b425-49d6-bb6a-2eac3d3e3679-3
01:28:40.334 --> 01:28:45.417
the back of the ship. And the
man with the box has stepped off

61466be6-b425-49d6-bb6a-2eac3d3e3679-4
01:28:45.417 --> 01:28:50.419
and has come closer into The
Cave to try to get them. They're

61466be6-b425-49d6-bb6a-2eac3d3e3679-5
01:28:50.419 --> 01:28:55.259
kind of hiding behind a a side
stone and the next thing we.

3dcea5a7-4736-49ea-a902-3621d195138d-0
01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.215
We see, we see the bird. We see
the man actually holding the

3dcea5a7-4736-49ea-a902-3621d195138d-1
01:29:00.215 --> 01:29:05.070
crayon. He's holding a brown
crayon it looks like. So this is

3dcea5a7-4736-49ea-a902-3621d195138d-2
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:09.846
a new color that for us. And he
pulls out a brown crayon. He

3dcea5a7-4736-49ea-a902-3621d195138d-3
01:29:09.846 --> 01:29:14.465
begins to draw like a doorway,
something that looks like a

3dcea5a7-4736-49ea-a902-3621d195138d-4
01:29:14.465 --> 01:29:18.850
doorway and like a little swing
for the bird to sit on.

a5506153-e728-411d-867a-53d6697b12d5-0
01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.910
And.

76899a57-c569-49da-9326-8c3074ced979-0
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:34.825
OK, we see the little girl and
the neighbor kind of hiding

76899a57-c569-49da-9326-8c3074ced979-1
01:29:34.825 --> 01:29:40.458
behind this stone still, but we
realize what the man has built

76899a57-c569-49da-9326-8c3074ced979-2
01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:41.800
is this little.

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-0
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:47.715
Box, it's almost like a like a
telephone booth type of a thing,

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-1
01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:51.983
but it's it's open on all sides,
it's closed at the top. It's

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-2
01:29:51.983 --> 01:29:56.182
kind of like a cage actually.
And the side doors are kind of

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-3
01:29:56.182 --> 01:30:00.450
like a cage, but they're down
and they're acting almost as if

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-4
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:04.786
it's a ramp to get up into the
cage. And in the center part is

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-5
01:30:04.786 --> 01:30:09.054
the swing and little Purple bird
is swinging on the swing and

e3f9a185-5ea3-41c5-817f-92b489332ea5-6
01:30:09.054 --> 01:30:13.460
next thing you know the man runs
up one of the cage door ramps.

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-0
01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:18.514
And he's got the box, and he's
trying to suck the bird into the

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-1
01:30:18.514 --> 01:30:23.302
box. But what happens is the box
goes flying out of his hands.

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-2
01:30:23.302 --> 01:30:28.090
You can see two feathers from
the bird kind of come out of the

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-3
01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:32.955
box. And the man is then inside
of this cage and the doors flip

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-4
01:30:32.955 --> 01:30:37.667
up and contain him in the cage.
And then you see a picture of

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-5
01:30:37.667 --> 01:30:42.075
the man in the cage and the
neighbor and the little girl.

cd0d323f-8e52-4d1c-bb08-2bd1a4276ee7-6
01:30:42.075 --> 01:30:43.900
The neighbor is holding.

5f97c9c3-4757-496b-bea9-40315a67d3a6-0
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:48.182
This box that he, the other man,
was carrying behind his head as

5f97c9c3-4757-496b-bea9-40315a67d3a6-1
01:30:48.182 --> 01:30:49.860
if he's going to throw it.

2c11fbd9-47be-482e-95bc-8e5343e471a2-0
01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:59.856
And when he does, he smashes it
down to the ground and the box

2c11fbd9-47be-482e-95bc-8e5343e471a2-1
01:30:59.856 --> 01:31:05.884
kind of goes into a million
pieces. And out of the box comes

2c11fbd9-47be-482e-95bc-8e5343e471a2-2
01:31:05.884 --> 01:31:11.813
this really, really, really
bright light. And the light, in

2c11fbd9-47be-482e-95bc-8e5343e471a2-3
01:31:11.813 --> 01:31:17.842
addition to the light comes all
of the colors of the crayons

2c11fbd9-47be-482e-95bc-8e5343e471a2-4
01:31:17.842 --> 01:31:23.080
that the box had had suctioned
in. We see the purple

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-0
01:31:23.150 --> 01:31:27.788
bird fly out, we see the purple
Pegasus fly out, we see a green

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-1
01:31:27.788 --> 01:31:31.847
dragonflies, blue birds, blue
butterflies, green yellow

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-2
01:31:31.847 --> 01:31:36.341
butterflies. And there's just
swirls of the different colors.

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-3
01:31:36.341 --> 01:31:40.545
So there's a a swirl of blue
that then kind of leads into

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-4
01:31:40.545 --> 01:31:44.822
purple and then that leads into
red and then that leads to

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-5
01:31:44.822 --> 01:31:49.461
orange, to yellow, to green. And
it's just swirls of color that

9297ff8f-6c9b-476b-b1bd-e59fd89c18c2-6
01:31:49.461 --> 01:31:53.809
are coming out and out through
the and out from the cavern.

4c594296-9ea8-4d58-abc8-fb6aa8ee7534-0
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:58.189
And it's very bright. And the
other crew members that are back

4c594296-9ea8-4d58-abc8-fb6aa8ee7534-1
01:31:58.189 --> 01:32:01.973
on that little deer boat are
kind of being blinded by the

4c594296-9ea8-4d58-abc8-fb6aa8ee7534-2
01:32:01.973 --> 01:32:05.170
colors and the light, as is the
man in the cage.

123bcb1f-0152-46ce-9696-f5cafb3aaffa-0
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:10.569
And then we see the little boy
and the older man get off the

123bcb1f-0152-46ce-9696-f5cafb3aaffa-1
01:32:10.569 --> 01:32:14.542
boat. We see different colored
birds flying through the the

123bcb1f-0152-46ce-9696-f5cafb3aaffa-2
01:32:14.542 --> 01:32:18.912
sky. We see the Pegasus carrying
the man in the cage away. And we

123bcb1f-0152-46ce-9696-f5cafb3aaffa-3
01:32:18.912 --> 01:32:23.150
see the little boy and the man
with their crown, and the little

123bcb1f-0152-46ce-9696-f5cafb3aaffa-4
01:32:23.150 --> 01:32:27.322
girl and the neighbor kind of
standing at the edge of The Cave

123bcb1f-0152-46ce-9696-f5cafb3aaffa-5
01:32:27.322 --> 01:32:29.110
looking out into the water.

4d83fc6e-03a6-44a0-9a8e-691b0d963ea2-0
01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:34.997
Um, in the next picture we see
them at that little door that

4d83fc6e-03a6-44a0-9a8e-691b0d963ea2-1
01:32:34.997 --> 01:32:39.096
was in The Cave. We see the
little girl with her crayon in

4d83fc6e-03a6-44a0-9a8e-691b0d963ea2-2
01:32:39.096 --> 01:32:43.264
her back shorts pocket and she
is hugging the neighbor. And

4d83fc6e-03a6-44a0-9a8e-691b0d963ea2-3
01:32:43.264 --> 01:32:47.711
then the man in the I'm sorry,
the older man and the little boy

4d83fc6e-03a6-44a0-9a8e-691b0d963ea2-4
01:32:47.711 --> 01:32:51.810
are kind of standing off with
the purple bird to the side.

5e683615-e4c2-4398-8cfd-433574476068-0
01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.246
Oh, and then on the I'm sorry,
the the door and The Cave is

5e683615-e4c2-4398-8cfd-433574476068-1
01:33:00.246 --> 01:33:04.089
open ajar just a little bit and
you can see that the edge of the

5e683615-e4c2-4398-8cfd-433574476068-2
01:33:04.089 --> 01:33:07.518
red kite that was in that man's
apartment is kind of come

5e683615-e4c2-4398-8cfd-433574476068-3
01:33:07.518 --> 01:33:11.183
through the doorway, a little
bit. You can see the edge of it

5e683615-e4c2-4398-8cfd-433574476068-4
01:33:11.183 --> 01:33:12.070
in the doorway.

7918aabf-245b-4400-9e43-be156d886b6b-0
01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.549
And then we then we have the
picture back to the House that

7918aabf-245b-4400-9e43-be156d886b6b-1
01:33:19.549 --> 01:33:23.585
the little girl and the man or
that residence that they live

7918aabf-245b-4400-9e43-be156d886b6b-2
01:33:23.585 --> 01:33:27.820
in. I'm thinking it might be 2
separate apartments, but we see.

eccc87c1-4319-426e-a244-66ffee4c025a-0
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:32.871
That that little door in The
Cave leads to the man's little

eccc87c1-4319-426e-a244-66ffee4c025a-1
01:33:32.871 --> 01:33:37.091
Art Room and office. And the
doors open and there's a bright

eccc87c1-4319-426e-a244-66ffee4c025a-2
01:33:37.091 --> 01:33:41.105
light and we see out in the
front of the building. We can

eccc87c1-4319-426e-a244-66ffee4c025a-3
01:33:41.105 --> 01:33:45.118
see the main door to the
building above the steps is open

eccc87c1-4319-426e-a244-66ffee4c025a-4
01:33:45.118 --> 01:33:49.338
and you can see a kite, a red
kite that's being flown out on

eccc87c1-4319-426e-a244-66ffee4c025a-5
01:33:49.338 --> 01:33:50.930
the street. #END_return

39aae464-1ad0-40eb-a028-84771086549b-0
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:57.620
That was the story was great.
OK, so we're gonna do.

67a89250-de0a-4414-9cab-82f5bb5a8ff1-0
01:33:59.430 --> 01:34:01.390
A couple more, OK.

ee377886-8e4a-4bf2-b5b1-63316b48b545-0
01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:05.530
Alright, let's see.

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-0
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:12.888
#START_picture_this All right,
so we've it looks like we have

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-1
01:34:12.888 --> 01:34:17.541
another wal. Where's Waldo? This
one is entitled picture this.

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-2
01:34:17.541 --> 01:34:22.046
That scene card is written on a
piece of notebook paper that

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-3
01:34:22.046 --> 01:34:26.329
comes out of like a spiral
notebook. So when you tear it,

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-4
01:34:26.329 --> 01:34:30.982
the little edges are still on
the paper and kind of torn. {And

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-5
01:34:30.982 --> 01:34:35.118
it's about there's it says
there's four characters that

a9163278-f168-4cea-96cb-c0c4e77e9fbf-6
01:34:35.118 --> 01:34:38.220
appear twice in the display, but
it's a.}

11774abd-a884-4090-a288-bda3daad5442-0
01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.926
It's a collage of different
framed portraits, so the people

11774abd-a884-4090-a288-bda3daad5442-1
01:34:42.926 --> 01:34:47.861
that we see in this one are all
in individual framed portraits,

11774abd-a884-4090-a288-bda3daad5442-2
01:34:47.861 --> 01:34:52.257
if that makes sense. So it's
just literally a collage of

11774abd-a884-4090-a288-bda3daad5442-3
01:34:52.257 --> 01:34:56.189
framed portraits in each
portrait has a different.

82e5e57c-3487-47c9-876a-367f3567707a-0
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.865
Person in it in a different
scene. We've got and they're all

82e5e57c-3487-47c9-876a-367f3567707a-1
01:35:01.865 --> 01:35:05.877
different colors. Some of the
backgrounds are yellow, some are

82e5e57c-3487-47c9-876a-367f3567707a-2
01:35:05.877 --> 01:35:09.890
a pale or yellow, green, pink.
There's like a pale blue-green.

f0355e73-7499-450e-bbe8-f9641270518a-0
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.380
And there's.

660f2155-536c-4e4f-9a1b-92f7c7529c49-0
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.480
Trying to figure out the theme
of these people.

7ec08b90-9ce7-49e7-8f91-b3312a8e9aeb-0
01:35:21.130 --> 01:35:28.913
Let's see. We see. We see some
Cavemen. We see some Vikings. We

7ec08b90-9ce7-49e7-8f91-b3312a8e9aeb-1
01:35:28.913 --> 01:35:35.967
see some like jokers or clowns.
We see like bodybuilders,

7ec08b90-9ce7-49e7-8f91-b3312a8e9aeb-2
01:35:35.967 --> 01:35:42.900
Cowboys. We see a cactus person.
We see a witch. We see.

e5e20cbf-ec99-4208-9881-8e70e5645e7a-0
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.870
Uh, let's see.

cb825c8e-df74-4458-82e8-107b9c645b12-0
01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:56.095
Huh. Now it looks like maybe a
wizard. In that one we see a man

cb825c8e-df74-4458-82e8-107b9c645b12-1
01:35:56.095 --> 01:36:00.630
looks like sumo wrestlers, two
sumo wrestlers. We see.

46d03cda-5040-450e-9d26-52f58a3ce50d-0
01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:05.353
Ah, we do have a couple that
have animals. Looks like there's

46d03cda-5040-450e-9d26-52f58a3ce50d-1
01:36:05.353 --> 01:36:08.860
one with the deer looks like,
one with a cat, one with the.

9a6745ca-1ecd-4004-9197-212c82f500aa-0
01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:13.430
Feel like that's almost kind of
like a hippopotamus maybe?

933e70d6-a9a6-4eb4-843e-7bbaf87c833e-0
01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.915
Yeah, just different. There's
one that has a hand, it has a

933e70d6-a9a6-4eb4-843e-7bbaf87c833e-1
01:36:19.915 --> 01:36:23.027
picture of like somebody's
fingers and I don't know what

933e70d6-a9a6-4eb4-843e-7bbaf87c833e-2
01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:26.303
they are like on the knuckles,
but it's got some kind of, I

933e70d6-a9a6-4eb4-843e-7bbaf87c833e-3
01:36:26.303 --> 01:36:29.579
don't know, maybe a tattoo on
the knuckles or they're maybe

933e70d6-a9a6-4eb4-843e-7bbaf87c833e-4
01:36:29.579 --> 01:36:31.490
they're wearing like rings like
a.

423d78cb-1556-48e5-8464-0b5ecbb51f02-0
01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.810
Knuckle brace of some sort.

967e8485-e1f2-40bf-ad02-077e5e16070a-0
01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:42.390
There's a fish that has like
human legs and feet.

af5557ad-3bf1-4517-89ec-5b5157166dc8-0
01:36:44.150 --> 01:36:46.760
Lots of different interest,
interesting things.

7eb6ac47-79a6-4125-861f-e81138727aad-0
01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.071
There's another. Let's see,
there's a dog. There's a woman

7eb6ac47-79a6-4125-861f-e81138727aad-1
01:36:54.071 --> 01:36:59.358
pouring water on three men who
are laying down. There is looks

7eb6ac47-79a6-4125-861f-e81138727aad-2
01:36:59.358 --> 01:37:04.310
like a bear that is got a
caveman tied up in a rope maybe.

9837f856-8edb-49dc-9ad6-54f4f9976d71-0
01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:10.280
A witch, I did say that one
already. Three ducks.

d3ad6291-980e-4d58-b5aa-150e1ce5d84e-0
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:15.121
It's an interesting there's two
like two young guys next to a

d3ad6291-980e-4d58-b5aa-150e1ce5d84e-1
01:37:15.121 --> 01:37:18.383
palm tree, and it looks like
maybe there's coconuts falling

d3ad6291-980e-4d58-b5aa-150e1ce5d84e-2
01:37:18.383 --> 01:37:19.580
out. #END_picture_this

d2aab8b6-3a82-4933-9ec7-3f9cfed4d6f8-0
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.220
Oh boy. OK.

fdc8dc3c-88e8-4c37-b9cc-a1056ffbbf5f-0
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.360
OK.

bb069ae7-6fab-40b0-82ed-f47349e69c80-0
01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.213
This will likely be our last
one. #START_make_a_splash OK,

bb069ae7-6fab-40b0-82ed-f47349e69c80-1
01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:35.750
this one's called making splash.
This is another.

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-0
01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.765
Um, it's another where where's
Waldo? Esque type. I don't think

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-1
01:37:41.765 --> 01:37:46.614
it's where's Waldo, but it's
that type of a picture scene. It

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-2
01:37:46.614 --> 01:37:51.463
is looks like it's a water park
and again it's it asks you to

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-3
01:37:51.463 --> 01:37:56.156
take if you can see all 10
Penguins, but it's got the water

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-4
01:37:56.156 --> 01:38:01.005
shoots, you know the like tubes
that are that come out of the

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-5
01:38:01.005 --> 01:38:05.697
mountain and sometimes they're
completely covered up and so

fa8d5f5b-236b-44c9-b44e-492e562fab57-6
01:38:05.697 --> 01:38:07.340
you're going through.

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-0
01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:11.262
You wouldn't. You what you do is
you start at the beginning and

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-1
01:38:11.262 --> 01:38:15.054
you slide down. There's water on
the bottom and you slide down

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-2
01:38:15.054 --> 01:38:18.425
through the tube, and then
there's portions of the tube

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-3
01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:22.218
where it opens up. So it's just
the bottom half you're sliding

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-4
01:38:22.218 --> 01:38:25.769
on, but it's open air. There's
three of those. There's one

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-5
01:38:25.769 --> 01:38:29.080
green, one yellow and one red,
and they're all kind of

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-6
01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:32.391
intertwined and tangled
together. And there's kids and

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-7
01:38:32.391 --> 01:38:35.943
adults that are sliding down
those. And then at the end it

35528cb1-9bb9-4c0a-a7b8-79addded3fd1-8
01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:38.050
leads into the main body of
water.

428b925f-b0bc-4c4c-8863-ccf6d59e75a5-0
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:43.740
Which is filled with people.
There's a long line of people to

428b925f-b0bc-4c4c-8863-ccf6d59e75a5-1
01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:47.818
get to the inner the the tubes,
but then there's also all kinds

428b925f-b0bc-4c4c-8863-ccf6d59e75a5-2
01:38:47.818 --> 01:38:51.960
of people in the water. Once you
slide out of the tubes that are

428b925f-b0bc-4c4c-8863-ccf6d59e75a5-3
01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.000
swimming in the water, there is.

daf32914-3168-4fb6-8676-9b94148383d8-0
01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.846
There is a ship there. It looks
like there's an inner tube canal

daf32914-3168-4fb6-8676-9b94148383d8-1
01:38:58.846 --> 01:39:02.119
in the waterway where people are
on like yellow inner tubes.

daf32914-3168-4fb6-8676-9b94148383d8-2
01:39:02.119 --> 01:39:05.552
Those are always fun where you
sit kind of on them and you lean

daf32914-3168-4fb6-8676-9b94148383d8-3
01:39:05.552 --> 01:39:06.250
back on them.

5e0ee13b-bd36-4407-8d34-0da4e389723e-0
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:12.367
There is a ship, it looks like a
pirate type ship and there's

5e0ee13b-bd36-4407-8d34-0da4e389723e-1
01:39:12.367 --> 01:39:17.009
people on the ship and it's got
kind of a bigger water slide

5e0ee13b-bd36-4407-8d34-0da4e389723e-2
01:39:17.009 --> 01:39:21.803
that you can slide down from the
top of the ship down into the

5e0ee13b-bd36-4407-8d34-0da4e389723e-3
01:39:21.803 --> 01:39:22.260
water.

651d5822-8970-4f7a-8240-d2633c185a20-0
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:26.550
There is looks like there is a
dragon, and I don't know if

651d5822-8970-4f7a-8240-d2633c185a20-1
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:29.604
that's a part of the ship or
just something else, but it

651d5822-8970-4f7a-8240-d2633c185a20-2
01:39:29.604 --> 01:39:32.819
looks like there's a dragon and
he curls around and there's

651d5822-8970-4f7a-8240-d2633c185a20-3
01:39:32.819 --> 01:39:36.194
people kind of hanging on him
and he's spouting out water from

651d5822-8970-4f7a-8240-d2633c185a20-4
01:39:36.194 --> 01:39:36.729
his mouth.

cac50069-e9fd-431b-89cc-eddcb5a6c2f8-0
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:44.097
There's another slide that is
open. I forget what they call

cac50069-e9fd-431b-89cc-eddcb5a6c2f8-1
01:39:44.097 --> 01:39:48.420
those, but it's an open slide,
so you slide down.

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-0
01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:54.079
And it's different colors. So
it's like the first lane, it's

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-1
01:39:54.079 --> 01:39:58.147
got like 5 lanes, I think to it.
And the 1st lane is red, next

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-2
01:39:58.147 --> 01:40:02.086
one is orange, the third one is
yellow. Oh no, it's got six,

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-3
01:40:02.086 --> 01:40:05.961
then green, then blue and then
the darker blue, which looks

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-4
01:40:05.961 --> 01:40:10.029
like it might be a purple. And
you start up high and it curves

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-5
01:40:10.029 --> 01:40:14.098
like down a hill and it's, it's
like a water slide that you go

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-6
01:40:14.098 --> 01:40:18.295
down. So there's kids and people
that are sliding down that into

86be67fa-d818-4472-9d2d-b418ca72b8ec-7
01:40:18.295 --> 01:40:19.910
the water. There are two.

381d6718-c1c2-4828-b295-d56602f7faa8-0
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:24.177
I don't know what they're. They
kind of look like mushrooms,

381d6718-c1c2-4828-b295-d56602f7faa8-1
01:40:24.177 --> 01:40:27.549
ones bigger. It's green with
little white specks. The other

381d6718-c1c2-4828-b295-d56602f7faa8-2
01:40:27.549 --> 01:40:30.865
one is smaller with red with
white specks. And it's one of

381d6718-c1c2-4828-b295-d56602f7faa8-3
01:40:30.865 --> 01:40:34.405
those things where there's water
that comes around the edge of

381d6718-c1c2-4828-b295-d56602f7faa8-4
01:40:34.405 --> 01:40:37.833
it, so you can kind of stand
under it and it'll rain kind of

381d6718-c1c2-4828-b295-d56602f7faa8-5
01:40:37.833 --> 01:40:38.620
on top of you.

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-0
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:44.018
There is a little on the other
side of the waterway. There is

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-1
01:40:44.018 --> 01:40:47.880
like a little bridge and a
little walkway that people are

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-2
01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.675
walking on. There's a lifeguard
on a life chair under an

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-3
01:40:51.675 --> 01:40:55.537
umbrella. You've got kids
squirting water guns at people.

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-4
01:40:55.537 --> 01:40:59.466
There's a little grassy area
where people have towels laid

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-5
01:40:59.466 --> 01:41:03.328
out and they're laying down and
chatting and getting just

e4745b14-4d06-4c2e-9a68-846ec66ef70e-6
01:41:03.328 --> 01:41:04.460
enjoying the sun.

db42f869-d81d-430b-ae67-900ac9c37eba-0
01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:10.694
And there is looks like there's
a snake in the water. It looks

db42f869-d81d-430b-ae67-900ac9c37eba-1
01:41:10.694 --> 01:41:15.392
like a big snake that people are
kind of sitting on. There's also

db42f869-d81d-430b-ae67-900ac9c37eba-2
01:41:15.392 --> 01:41:20.019
an elephant over along the canal
that the inner tubes are coming

db42f869-d81d-430b-ae67-900ac9c37eba-3
01:41:20.019 --> 01:41:24.290
down and out of his trunk is
spraying water. So as you come

db42f869-d81d-430b-ae67-900ac9c37eba-4
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:28.419
down the canal with the inner
tubes, you get wet from the

db42f869-d81d-430b-ae67-900ac9c37eba-5
01:41:28.419 --> 01:41:29.059
elephant.

e794fa4b-0ee2-4231-aa6d-cb29b24195e1-0
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:35.120
And then there's looks like I
see a couple of lifeguards

e794fa4b-0ee2-4231-aa6d-cb29b24195e1-1
01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:35.690
actually.

fdfa54cc-d101-4ee6-86be-fe746ee585ab-0
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:42.620
Yeah, I'm trying to think if I
missed anything else.

0e4e185a-13e2-4df2-b84f-da0829e4f041-0
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:48.598
But yeah, just people enjoying
time out at the lake or the

0e4e185a-13e2-4df2-b84f-da0829e4f041-1
01:41:48.598 --> 01:41:52.395
water, the water park.
#END_make_a_splash OK, well,

0e4e185a-13e2-4df2-b84f-da0829e4f041-2
01:41:52.395 --> 01:41:55.900
thank you. That's all for today.
OK, recording.
