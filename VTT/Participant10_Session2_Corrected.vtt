00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.770
Both of the children look very
surprised.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.082
One child has a purple piece of
looks like chalk in his hand, a

eaafac20-09e2-4b04-8867-3e11255453c5-1
00:20:52.082 --> 00:20:56.641
large piece of purple chalk, and
the other child has a large

eaafac20-09e2-4b04-8867-3e11255453c5-2
00:20:56.641 --> 00:20:58.509
piece of red chalk. They.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.184
Kids have fallen over in
surprise. They get up and the

e51cf3c2-260c-4132-8f58-e5fcb248e532-1
00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:04.590
king.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:14.740
Belt or sort of sash around the
shoulder of the other child.

ffa61498-16ad-4885-9f8f-aebcccf5131e-0
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:23.245
He points forward, and as he is
gesturing to forward of them,

ffa61498-16ad-4885-9f8f-aebcccf5131e-1
00:21:23.245 --> 00:21:28.941
several soldiers reach out from
the door and grab the king and

ffa61498-16ad-4885-9f8f-aebcccf5131e-2
00:21:28.941 --> 00:21:30.930
pull him back through.

1ab600d5-86a8-49c0-a350-a4893dedf203-0
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.700
The.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.359
Soldiers pushed the king back
through the door, and as he has

59ab8adc-7d44-4cf9-84d0-2d15d233735e-1
00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:41.270
pulled back, the king gestures
at the children.

bab68602-1ffd-4207-baeb-4873994ac45c-0
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.890
The two children look at each
other in surprise.

3be177e8-8047-4fed-b66d-ccdaf091a812-0
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:54.367
And excitement. The one boy
looks at his purple crayon or

3be177e8-8047-4fed-b66d-ccdaf091a812-1
00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:54.910
purple.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.230
Chalk

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.960
The other child takes his.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.750
Red Crayon and begins to draw
and he draws a red key.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.820
And the other boy with the
Purple bird draws a purple key.

6e0438fd-26d6-4b90-ba20-cd03475ebc3d-0
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.572
They then use both their keys to
open the doors and they go

6e0438fd-26d6-4b90-ba20-cd03475ebc3d-1
00:22:15.572 --> 00:22:16.080
through.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.180
On the other side of the door
they emerge.

b765215f-b71b-433d-93b5-8c046aa6d7c1-0
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.980

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.360
Clearly been transported.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.830
To a much different place from
the park there where they

133bdd2d-dba9-4636-a3c5-c19f5073e89c-1
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.920
started, they are.

f26bfaad-fc9b-4df7-beda-f1b283360cf8-0
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.140
On one side of a river or a
Moat.

5ada4d9b-3bc4-408c-89ea-daf8c21a5b3c-0
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.650
And and the other side is a
large castle.

566dcb06-98bb-4846-96f1-7783d0a59278-0
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.258
The children are cracked,
crouched behind a rock, and they

566dcb06-98bb-4846-96f1-7783d0a59278-1
00:22:55.258 --> 00:23:00.510
can see that the king is being
held on a large paddle boat by

566dcb06-98bb-4846-96f1-7783d0a59278-2
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.730
many soldiers. And the boat is
going.

14fc59bc-4d96-4b93-9b87-3a03582772f6-0
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.460
Under the tunnel into the
castle.

0259583e-991f-4b93-bce4-fc8382230a78-0
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.900
Around you can see that the
castle is on fire.

2a4f7922-c45a-4582-bfe5-216e733ea2bc-0
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.780
And burning. Many of the turrets
have red flames and smoke coming

2a4f7922-c45a-4582-bfe5-216e733ea2bc-1
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.540
out of them.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.630
And in the distance you can see
some clouds and mountains.

c41ff645-2c55-4f36-8f9b-dd8509bd26db-0
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.440
But in the sky you can see many.

5cababdb-3626-47e4-a55b-c8f059ec8662-0
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.790
Three different.

Flying.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.260
Flying vehicles which

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.580
Sort of look like.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.121
Not not hot air balloons, but
looks like they're being held up

277e6175-d16a-4af9-a597-d4e746bf3889-1
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:52.099
by air in a large tank or or
helium in a large tank, and they

277e6175-d16a-4af9-a597-d4e746bf3889-2
00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:52.420
have.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.690
Fans that run them.

f9768166-5123-4abb-bd6f-20b57bdbefb4-0
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.890
The children are looking at the
piece of paper that the king

f9768166-5123-4abb-bd6f-20b57bdbefb4-1
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:08.430
gave to them.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.960
You can see that the.

97c6af83-0f5f-4318-871b-dc4b52c4a604-0
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.900

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.620
And is headed off into the
distance.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.992
Above the tunnel, up on top of
the bridge, there are several

ad6e7dcc-a23b-43a1-b015-f27704681ad5-1
00:24:25.992 --> 00:24:30.443
boats that must run in a stream,
and there are many people

ad6e7dcc-a23b-43a1-b015-f27704681ad5-2
00:24:30.443 --> 00:24:32.330
looking down at the king.

57e35c37-699b-478e-ad65-2daedcf9eb1a-0
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.829
There's a close up view of the
piece of paper the King has

57e35c37-699b-478e-ad65-2daedcf9eb1a-1
00:24:37.829 --> 00:24:40.620
given them, and it shows a very
detailed map.

09eee899-cd3c-4d69-a317-5161d156d7f4-0
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.670
And on the map.

see.

a7dbcef3-1f3e-426f-a27d-a423dccec16a-0
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.260
A large land mass.

c78cceda-8b02-43f2-8104-bff4862b451c-0
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.950
Separated by water.

castle.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.490
And it's like temples.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.450

water.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.955
You can see it starts with a a
palm tree and then progresses

73d50994-78a2-4f09-81b5-36de9ca25807-1
00:25:17.955 --> 00:25:18.180

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.418
A forest with a door in the
trunk of a tree and then a

And then what looks like a
Grecian temple ruins under the

e22b8944-9bad-4966-b0b6-a6f853ac48f8-1
00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:30.520

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.153
Tall, pointy building and a
mountain top, and as the map

proceeds in the circle, it picks
up different colors and ends in

00:25:41.856 --> 00:25:42.579
a rainbow.

The children continue to hide
behind the rock while their

00:25:50.426 --> 00:25:51.940
purple bird flies around them.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.199
The three boats that were up on
top of the bridge have made

00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:59.290
their way down to the the river.

507cb056-cbc2-46f6-a9fe-eac28aa483ce-0

Uniform is pointing to the rock
as if he has seen the children.

6bf7f623-c68a-474f-9106-30b22e2783ea-1
00:26:09.223 --> 00:26:13.828
The children climb up on top of
the rock and use their pieces of

6bf7f623-c68a-474f-9106-30b22e2783ea-2
00:26:13.828 --> 00:26:14.820
chalk to draw.

d98514c6-22b3-4de8-bacd-17faca927fc7-0
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.957
The boy with the purple piece of
chalk turns the bird into a sea

d98514c6-22b3-4de8-bacd-17faca927fc7-1
00:26:21.957 --> 00:26:26.377
monster, a Purple Sea monster
with tentacles, and the other

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.998

see that they're, they're

that sort of looks like like the

Grecian ruins and they are
swimming down towards it. There

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.720

Made from several seahorses
back-to-back, it's a carved

And a in the center of the shell
is another piece of chalk that

They pick up the chalk and they
grab back onto the tentacles of

And start swimming away. As they
start swimming away, they see

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.338

What the children drew was a
large purple rhinoceros and a

it knocks some of the soldiers

01:31:11.150 --> 01:31:12.350
The man from the boat.

382cb8c2-4fdd-449a-9d62-f9e8e7be04b0-0
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.930
Stands looking confused with
this suitcase.

958e139d-def5-42bb-b799-78e05c7e0c1a-0
01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:27.511
The man opens up a pocket watch
and looks at the time. He then

958e139d-def5-42bb-b799-78e05c7e0c1a-1
01:31:27.511 --> 01:31:29.640
looks at the time upon a
building.

8977ff99-35b0-4117-8ada-3b1373a40742-0
01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.470
He walks along with his
suitcase.

aa3ff9bd-2993-4241-9ccf-7d741cae6ce9-0
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:34.680
Past different stores.

805eb800-3bf0-4c88-93e3-ddefb60bfa0d-0
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:40.169
Suddenly there are small glowing
orbs floating through the air.

805eb800-3bf0-4c88-93e3-ddefb60bfa0d-1
01:31:40.169 --> 01:31:41.530
He tries to touch one.

06218f01-cf08-4878-bab0-7c5e70b0ef23-0
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:46.190
And then they all go whizzing
away. His hat falls off.

d36b6559-5566-4915-9613-212c70eeeac2-0
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.570
He picks it up and looks at a
book.

ce30cec6-248e-4006-9060-dbadec7c334b-0
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:54.610
The book is in an unknown
language, man.

b255f868-d4ef-40a5-96dd-f353156c2588-0
01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.491
Bent over and taps him on the
shoulder. He offers him his

b255f868-d4ef-40a5-96dd-f353156c2588-1
01:31:58.491 --> 01:31:58.770
hand.

01:31:59.690 --> 01:32:00.980
The two of whom talk.

bd2e7377-e0db-421d-bed7-cc5315977a66-0
01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.810
The one man.

86f615d4-c849-4ea8-9836-0191329ff16b-0
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.977
Draws a picture for the other
man, and the man seems to have

86f615d4-c849-4ea8-9836-0191329ff16b-1
01:32:07.977 --> 01:32:08.420
an idea.

41ebe119-861d-442b-a1c0-3a11bd88765f-0
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:13.241
The man gestured for him to
follow him, and the man with the

41ebe119-861d-442b-a1c0-3a11bd88765f-1
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:14.680
suitcase follows him along.

01949717-dce4-4bb6-8e99-60e40b0f10ee-0
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:18.228
#END_arrival-3 The second man
has a satchel on his back with

01949717-dce4-4bb6-8e99-60e40b0f10ee-1
01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:18.650
an animal.

d7b559bb-cdcb-4a4d-9609-a74332ea9fce-0
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.560
{OK, next we have a complex
scene.}

2ab110c1-be6f-4384-b16b-88d90fdc7e84-0
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:34.790
{OK.}

264073e3-af85-404f-92e4-1842c1ccddd9-0
01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.390
{Um, so just describe what you
see in the scene.}

383447b1-441b-4e39-bdb9-b3f41769afb3-0
01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.060
{And you could be when you're
ready.}

c59a304a-e160-4a84-b709-24acfb149e4a-0
01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.730
#START_campsite This is a scene
of.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.010
Multiple large grassy fields.

01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:54.470
That are walled by hedges.

5e594af5-4010-40eb-a5af-0b0e72746216-0
01:32:56.540 --> 01:33:00.690
Some of the fields are very
large, while some of them are

5e594af5-4010-40eb-a5af-0b0e72746216-1
01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:01.120
small.

bcfa4ac1-402c-4baf-a0f0-7100f770fa0c-0
01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:05.320
There are white pathways in
between them.

e753a271-ff30-48bf-a7d0-dc8bf7caa9c9-0
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:09.130
And there is a stream that runs
down the center.

1e97449c-aab7-4256-a351-356f8b1e3bcc-0
01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.170
There is a bridge that goes over
the stream.

ca1e456a-7ae2-4bb2-b3b7-9d2d0d394f82-0
01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:17.599
In the background you can see
more and more fields going off

ca1e456a-7ae2-4bb2-b3b7-9d2d0d394f82-1
01:33:17.599 --> 01:33:19.590
into the distance with some
trees.

d114db0d-432c-4f7b-b5b0-372df48e391a-0
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:24.330
And people are camping in the
different fields.

e749779e-1374-4413-9701-1df01fb4fed5-0
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:26.800
One field is.

6af1d78a-fb1d-4987-ab25-92d1b75eb9bf-0
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:30.240
Has nine different.

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:33.280
RV's or campers in it?

6e1c57eb-9c15-4cb5-940a-1228e7e177c6-0
01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.250
And the people have.

7d69734e-8770-410e-81f0-dbe6dfdb18a8-0
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.002
Have all gotten out of their
RV's and are talking to each

7d69734e-8770-410e-81f0-dbe6dfdb18a8-1
01:33:40.002 --> 01:33:40.520
other and.

Setting up.

01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:47.410
One of the RV's has smoke coming
out of it.

19121ebb-dfa1-4f81-9ba1-4e067ee24a05-0
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:51.990
There is a man barbecuing.

06b78965-8026-4594-8cf5-c7106284b835-0
01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:57.190
There are lots and lots of
people in the pathways.

745e478f-b6b7-445c-8249-fcb84a09baf5-0
01:33:58.150 --> 01:34:02.049
Some of them are fishing in the
stream, some of them are waving

745e478f-b6b7-445c-8249-fcb84a09baf5-1
01:34:02.049 --> 01:34:03.390
at people in the boat.

01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.460
Some of them are talking to each
other.

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:11.232
There is a man riding a bicycle
and a little boy is sprinkling

fa9cd768-125d-4f25-ad7f-4911cc3259a4-1
01:34:11.232 --> 01:34:12.440
tacks in front of it.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.280
There are a couple of dogs.

5d59b65b-19b2-45fa-8f02-7f0adc171671-0
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:19.980
There is a group of.

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:26.698
Boy Scouts, perhaps, and they
seem to be doing some kind of

69638440-f920-40e8-b1a7-9b3852748bcd-1
01:34:26.698 --> 01:34:27.340
exercise.

01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:29.650
Some of those scouts are
learning.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.070
How to start a fire?

86a95ea2-f147-4874-b830-9ad1c37908a6-0
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.507
In one of the smaller fields,
there are several bulls being

86a95ea2-f147-4874-b830-9ad1c37908a6-1
01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:44.057
held. There's a gate and a break
in the hedge. People are

86a95ea2-f147-4874-b830-9ad1c37908a6-2
01:34:44.057 --> 01:34:48.843
standing around and looking at
the Bulls. Some of the people

86a95ea2-f147-4874-b830-9ad1c37908a6-3
01:34:48.843 --> 01:34:53.080
have jumped the hedge and are
antagonizing the Bulls.

ba989a68-bd63-465b-8674-47d702f68eed-0
01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:55.620
Uh.

bd890a8f-3f3b-4ccd-b1fa-7ddad914af81-0
01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.350

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.400
From the edge of the scene.

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:06.588
Is a large group of travelers
who look like they have been

da3420ac-030d-4366-8cd9-d94fe533d677-1
01:35:06.588 --> 01:35:08.230
hiking for a long, long time.

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:13.655
They're having holding them very
heavy packs on their backs and

022a9ae2-6ac5-48d7-bc06-f58b48f3ce06-1
01:35:13.655 --> 01:35:15.160
using walking sticks.

22a1567d-c6eb-466f-9a78-349400100c82-0
01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:20.203
Towards the front of the line,
the people have fallen down or

22a1567d-c6eb-466f-9a78-349400100c82-1
01:35:20.203 --> 01:35:23.693
crawling along on their hands
and knees towards a water

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:31.760
Section field people are camping
in tents.

tents, all different shapes, all

01:35:36.622 --> 01:35:37.550
different colors.

01:35:39.850 --> 01:35:45.110
Some peak, some blue, some are
yellow. One of the tents appears

5706aa69-19be-4fff-934f-36b5e84b4bd8-1
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:50.124
to be occupied by hippies, and
they have flowers painted all

01:35:50.124 --> 01:35:51.440
over their tent.

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.660
One of the tents is actually a
teepee and there are several

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.930
Native Americans sitting outside
it.

people are trying to put it back

of people.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.260
