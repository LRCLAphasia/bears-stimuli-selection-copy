00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.832
{OK, so you are about to see a
complex scene. Imagine you are

b3a1995a-2840-4d41-9ca7-6ab3b748f53c-1
00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:10.790
describing the scene to someone
who cannot see the picture.}

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-0
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.299
{Describe what is happening and
what you see in the in the scene

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-1
00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.819
as thoroughly as possible. And
then for complex scenes we ask

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-2
00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.194
that you take between 3 to 5
minutes to describe the scene.

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-3
00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:29.788
And I will also keep a timer to
like let you know if we want a

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-4
00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:34.235
little bit more description or
if we're ready to move on. So

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-5
00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:38.610
I'm going to stop my share and
I'm going to share the first

2013c621-3978-4a07-beff-54c025e5ffc0-6
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.850
scene, which is.}

877a671b-f2d7-4304-9c8b-c18f0bdb4b5f-0
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.020
{Hey, which I have to pull up.}

6cb64b08-8b54-4f1d-b861-c58d890e061a-0
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.740
{OK.}

f733e554-ba47-49be-afea-6eb63b1900b6-0
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.940
{Right. Yep. OK. And now I'm
going to share my screen.}

8da942f1-baee-4921-83e4-0287eda872c7-0
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.610
{OK, and I will make this
bigger.}

35f25222-3f9d-40b1-b060-36182f83c562-0
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.849
{You could begin when you're
ready. OK. }

35f25222-3f9d-40b1-b060-36182f83c562-1
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.160
#START_escape_from_the_zoo And
so this is a scene at the zoo.

a5b1c6f9-e02f-4bda-b507-b3fe03de580d-0
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.593
There are a lot of people at the
zoo. There are also a lot of

a5b1c6f9-e02f-4bda-b507-b3fe03de580d-1
00:01:24.593 --> 00:01:25.150
animals.

fd8e7f10-1faf-4e0e-8d09-0cf84c041f33-0
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.980
The top right has two buildings.

7412cc6d-7086-4e5a-b45b-22a03af4a3aa-0
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.964
The shop is the one on the
further right. Left of that is a

7412cc6d-7086-4e5a-b45b-22a03af4a3aa-1
00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:41.737
cafe and towards the center is
an ice cream stand. The ice

7412cc6d-7086-4e5a-b45b-22a03af4a3aa-2
00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:46.429
cream stand is shaped like an
ice cream cone and says ice

7412cc6d-7086-4e5a-b45b-22a03af4a3aa-3
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.070
cream, there's a man inside like
the vendor.

272033a8-c887-4b6e-b7e1-10aa08d23490-0
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.299
To the left of that, it looks
like kind of an ice rink. Maybe

272033a8-c887-4b6e-b7e1-10aa08d23490-1
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.334
it has little steps, like an ice
sculpture that seems to be empty

272033a8-c887-4b6e-b7e1-10aa08d23490-2
00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:03.700
and.

40c986b1-cc7b-4d50-ba61-7f11df62377e-0
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.102
In the upper left hand corner is
the polar bear exhibit. I see 3

40c986b1-cc7b-4d50-ba61-7f11df62377e-1
00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:15.427
white polar bears in there and
in the foreground of that is a

40c986b1-cc7b-4d50-ba61-7f11df62377e-2
00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:20.665
tree branch that you can see.
There are two I believe lemurs

40c986b1-cc7b-4d50-ba61-7f11df62377e-3
00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:25.818
in the tree and then also a
green bird that kind of appears

40c986b1-cc7b-4d50-ba61-7f11df62377e-4
00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:27.880
to be squawking at them.

20095260-0cac-40a2-8ffc-03632ace13cf-0
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.314
So closer towards the center of
the scene, like I said, it's

20095260-0cac-40a2-8ffc-03632ace13cf-1
00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:39.214
very crowded, so there are a lot
of people in the walkway. The

20095260-0cac-40a2-8ffc-03632ace13cf-2
00:02:39.214 --> 00:02:43.881
walkway goes around that ice
sculpture and then to the cafe

20095260-0cac-40a2-8ffc-03632ace13cf-3
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:48.393
and shop at the top, also
towards the left with the polar

20095260-0cac-40a2-8ffc-03632ace13cf-4
00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:49.560
bear enclosure.

b15da856-d037-43e2-b6e1-7c2f93c1acf3-0
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.167
At the very top, it looks like
the elephant is in there. It

b15da856-d037-43e2-b6e1-7c2f93c1acf3-1
00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:01.968
looks like maybe two or one
elephant, 1 rhinoceros and an

b15da856-d037-43e2-b6e1-7c2f93c1acf3-2
00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:07.184
ostrich in that area together.
And there are people looking at

b15da856-d037-43e2-b6e1-7c2f93c1acf3-3
00:03:07.184 --> 00:03:12.234
that exhibit. There are people
looking at the polar bears in

b15da856-d037-43e2-b6e1-7c2f93c1acf3-4
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:16.787
the middle of kind of this
chaotic scene as a kangaroo

b15da856-d037-43e2-b6e1-7c2f93c1acf3-5
00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:17.450
jumping.

6be6c56b-bdff-41a9-be81-198343f0dbc2-0
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.830
With a crowd of people around,
there's also a tree with a bench

6be6c56b-bdff-41a9-be81-198343f0dbc2-1
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.310
around it and three people are
sitting there.

8f83ac59-e6c1-4980-b4b9-f02965a23989-0
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.047
Now, if you go below that ice
exhibit area to the left,

8f83ac59-e6c1-4980-b4b9-f02965a23989-1
00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:41.934
there's an exhibit with zebras.
I see two zebras, white and

8f83ac59-e6c1-4980-b4b9-f02965a23989-2
00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:46.640
black stripes, and three pink
flamingos.

a9a7bb57-8c66-49f3-b653-6dcc1afb085c-0
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.499
There's a white bird there that
has a large flat beak. It looks

a9a7bb57-8c66-49f3-b653-6dcc1afb085c-1
00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:57.094
like there's also a hippo
swimming, what kind of appears

a9a7bb57-8c66-49f3-b653-6dcc1afb085c-2
00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:02.334
to be a Moat around the zebras,
so the hippo is only half above.

a9a7bb57-8c66-49f3-b653-6dcc1afb085c-3
00:04:02.334 --> 00:04:07.252
The water you can see its 2
ears, two eyes and two nostrils.

a9a7bb57-8c66-49f3-b653-6dcc1afb085c-4
00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:11.686
There's a little white bird
perched on the back of the

a9a7bb57-8c66-49f3-b653-6dcc1afb085c-5
00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:12.170
hippo.

9624ffa5-4fb1-45a3-86d0-7e81d916b325-0
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.739
Down from that, there is a
walkway that leads between that

9624ffa5-4fb1-45a3-86d0-7e81d916b325-1
00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.400
exhibit and the lions. So a male
and female lion perched on top

9624ffa5-4fb1-45a3-86d0-7e81d916b325-2
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.354
of a rock and it looks like
maybe, Umm, I don't know, a

9624ffa5-4fb1-45a3-86d0-7e81d916b325-3
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:37.103
weasel something that is poking
his head out of the dirt next to

9624ffa5-4fb1-45a3-86d0-7e81d916b325-4
00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:37.900
the lion.

cb023c9a-c130-494e-b470-0d4f5b797c55-0
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.590
Umm.

4b11ae16-7931-4e71-8500-4fdd11ef9ffd-0
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.280
In that exhibit, you can tell
that it's deep.

efd391ca-6ea7-4d29-b1f0-a034d3a8f1b7-0
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.931
Between the walkway and the
rocks that the lions are perched

efd391ca-6ea7-4d29-b1f0-a034d3a8f1b7-1
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:56.165
on top of, and there are two
people hanging from the the

efd391ca-6ea7-4d29-b1f0-a034d3a8f1b7-2
00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:56.760
railing.

5f4a79b4-d178-4de7-9eaa-fc5a87a3a1fc-0
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.840
One looks like his jumping into
that exhibit.

e6d10e4e-2f51-4a00-b927-eb2be870c5d1-0
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.352
One is kind of leaning and the
reason that they're trying to

e6d10e4e-2f51-4a00-b927-eb2be870c5d1-1
00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:13.035
get away from a rhinoceros that
is running through the pathway

e6d10e4e-2f51-4a00-b927-eb2be870c5d1-2
00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:14.840
with all the people.

22045acf-a69e-4761-b7f3-f72fda1c987d-0
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.513
And there are a couple in the
Lions exhibit that look like

22045acf-a69e-4761-b7f3-f72fda1c987d-1
00:05:21.513 --> 00:05:22.290
they have.

22f81d32-4319-497d-811a-2dc53fd4e8ba-0
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.291
Been hit, you know, by the
rhinoceros possibly. And then in

22f81d32-4319-497d-811a-2dc53fd4e8ba-1
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:31.734
front of the rhinoceros there is
a mob of people trying to get

22f81d32-4319-497d-811a-2dc53fd4e8ba-2
00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:33.850
away. So a lot of chaos there.

0e9d3cad-0e6c-4cc3-a07c-17ab0a678b8b-0
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.530
Just above that walkway.

eeb6d52a-ecdf-41cc-8523-c0d2bd1088ce-0
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.757
There it's the walkway between
the Lions exhibit and the the

eeb6d52a-ecdf-41cc-8523-c0d2bd1088ce-1
00:05:44.757 --> 00:05:49.851
bottom, and then there's giraffe
exhibit kind of in the middle on

eeb6d52a-ecdf-41cc-8523-c0d2bd1088ce-2
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:52.630
the right there are three
giraffes.

cc7c152a-a0f5-4f4c-90bf-68c019b8966b-0
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.970
There is a parrot that is blue
and looks like a green head,

cc7c152a-a0f5-4f4c-90bf-68c019b8966b-1
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.602
yellow on the underside. The
parrot is flying. There's also a

cc7c152a-a0f5-4f4c-90bf-68c019b8966b-2
00:06:05.602 --> 00:06:10.780
small plane with a propeller in
the front and one pilot.

bb1c3072-431f-4147-b35e-f7fdbbd4c036-0
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.990
In the same exhibit with the
zebras.

1b524178-4fba-4f39-bd7c-9cd94cfc8851-0
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.740
Looks like a couple antelope.

7c46a69e-111c-42c5-9111-b025a5d482e4-0
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.591
Maybe anteaters? The one
anteater is standing up and

7c46a69e-111c-42c5-9111-b025a5d482e4-1
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.150
pointing.

338745a9-3607-40d9-b639-835e23b7ec45-0
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.183
Umm, kind of above that exhibit
with the giraffes. And just to

338745a9-3607-40d9-b639-835e23b7ec45-1
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:37.414
the right of the shop is a
gorillas. So there are six

338745a9-3607-40d9-b639-835e23b7ec45-2
00:06:37.414 --> 00:06:43.517
guerrillas that I count kind of
rocks that go up to a point on

338745a9-3607-40d9-b639-835e23b7ec45-3
00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:49.814
the right hand side. That's the
side of the page and they're all

338745a9-3607-40d9-b639-835e23b7ec45-4
00:06:49.814 --> 00:06:50.590
kind of.

dca95e30-1768-43b4-aa85-552b76761e90-0
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.421
#END_escape_from_the_zoo Placed
on the rocks there. {OK, that

dca95e30-1768-43b4-aa85-552b76761e90-1
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:00.020
was perfect. Let me see what we
have next.}

79f98125-2b3d-4338-b382-342fc7304746-0
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.740
{We have another complex scene.}

f14b4afe-a642-4a8a-a802-762cf5f4ef8d-0
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.080
{I'm going to share my screen.}

d682f726-06b8-406e-8824-c1a610ef8514-0
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.553
{And I will make it bigger, so
I'd like you just to do the same

d682f726-06b8-406e-8824-c1a610ef8514-1
00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:19.000
thing but with this one.}

c283aef2-8bdd-4111-99bd-d83ea43faf8f-0
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.304
#START_being_a_pirate Right. So
this is being a pirate. The

c283aef2-8bdd-4111-99bd-d83ea43faf8f-1
00:07:26.304 --> 00:07:31.270
majority of the scene is in a
sea, so there's water. It looks

c283aef2-8bdd-4111-99bd-d83ea43faf8f-2
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.475
like the water is pretty rough.
There's a lot of waves going on,

c283aef2-8bdd-4111-99bd-d83ea43faf8f-3
00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:41.600
white kind of in the mix of that
Blue Sea. On the far right, it

c283aef2-8bdd-4111-99bd-d83ea43faf8f-4
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.565
looks like a shoreline. So on
the shoreline there are several

c283aef2-8bdd-4111-99bd-d83ea43faf8f-5
00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:50.570
people. I see a few palm trees
just on the right.

bb43a3e5-a915-457a-ae60-ab49ec85ae31-0
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.951
The upper right hand side of the
picture is it looks like a Cliff

bb43a3e5-a915-457a-ae60-ab49ec85ae31-1
00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:58.780
with trees on the top and then
also rocks.

6e08d985-0611-4a8e-a2e9-79c2d2eaadb8-0
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.980
So in the sea.

c5c413e6-8499-4bc9-a905-46f170ce7328-0
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.550
There is towards the middle one
very large pirate ship.

26ca6394-767c-4d68-b79e-00aaba7cab7b-0
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.422
It is very crowded. There are a
lot of people. It looks like

26ca6394-767c-4d68-b79e-00aaba7cab7b-1
00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:18.710
people are kind of flinging
themselves off the boats over.

c6a8166a-9e87-459b-aae2-3768e8aa88cc-0
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.080
The, I don't know what they're
called, but the polls that you

c6a8166a-9e87-459b-aae2-3768e8aa88cc-1
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.696
would climb up to like look out,
and all of the sails are drawn

c6a8166a-9e87-459b-aae2-3768e8aa88cc-2
00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:34.470
up, so you don't see any of the
sails out.

f5dc4748-bb0c-4316-bc0f-b84c9cd02510-0
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:43.674
Around the large ship are two
other like medium sized ships in

f5dc4748-bb0c-4316-bc0f-b84c9cd02510-1
00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:45.500
the sea and then.

f0005ef5-0f8c-4249-b59f-9695d6dc0413-0
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.677
Maybe 17 or more little boats
that are like, they're all

f0005ef5-0f8c-4249-b59f-9695d6dc0413-1
00:08:54.677 --> 00:08:59.236
filled with people and they have
paddles, so they're paddle boats

f0005ef5-0f8c-4249-b59f-9695d6dc0413-2
00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:03.450
that they're and it looks like
they're maybe going to shore.

caf42f20-23f9-4651-9fa0-79b777081cfe-0
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.829
Now in the sea is a very chaotic
scene. There is an octopus, what

caf42f20-23f9-4651-9fa0-79b777081cfe-1
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:13.970
it looks like, maybe like a sea
monster with legs out.

094468fe-73b7-4ffc-ba33-5bd9a25609cd-0
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.790
He has three people in his
tentacles.

5c6cae48-f550-4d8d-9c81-eeec8490699f-0
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:21.790
And.

0ca2aea9-386c-4ac7-87cf-747b3fd71a43-0
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:30.502
And then there is also on that
one main ship, it looks like

0ca2aea9-386c-4ac7-87cf-747b3fd71a43-1
00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:36.361
there's a cannon beam shot from
that. Umm, maybe a few of them.

0ca2aea9-386c-4ac7-87cf-747b3fd71a43-2
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:42.037
I see four like puffs of smoke.
Two of them it looks like red

0ca2aea9-386c-4ac7-87cf-747b3fd71a43-3
00:09:42.037 --> 00:09:46.340
flames kind of from the cannon
being shot off.

311a3304-fbf4-4db1-b898-545a92bbe216-0
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.460
The ship.

bf344942-099e-47cb-85f0-49d55f909039-0
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.024
That is to the left of that,
that large one has a pirates

bf344942-099e-47cb-85f0-49d55f909039-1
00:09:54.024 --> 00:09:58.091
flag. You can't see the entire
ship, but you can just see the

bf344942-099e-47cb-85f0-49d55f909039-2
00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:02.355
back of it and it looks like one
of the row boats was collecting

bf344942-099e-47cb-85f0-49d55f909039-3
00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:03.930
people from there maybe.

f464fef4-1309-4dc5-82a8-572a4b8b6bf1-0
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.300
But that one is also full.

64b46c20-a3e7-41b8-a373-6877f587de7e-0
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.690
Above in the sky there are six
birds flying around.

b904283d-8b90-4e9e-8357-d382235d73a8-0
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.343
And now the other medium size
ship has three of the pirate

b904283d-8b90-4e9e-8357-d382235d73a8-1
00:10:21.343 --> 00:10:26.017
flags of the skull and
crossbones. There are people

b904283d-8b90-4e9e-8357-d382235d73a8-2
00:10:26.017 --> 00:10:31.680
there also. The sails are drawn
up, but they're sitting on top

b904283d-8b90-4e9e-8357-d382235d73a8-3
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.490
of those.

56460624-ae31-4024-8b1a-a4450d1e6ec3-0
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.730
Post that the sails come down
from.

4f9972a5-d8c0-40c5-91d4-2173ac4f7c00-0
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.687
I see another maybe cannon
that's going over. It's being

4f9972a5-d8c0-40c5-91d4-2173ac4f7c00-1
00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:47.136
shot, so like an arch into the
water towards another small

4f9972a5-d8c0-40c5-91d4-2173ac4f7c00-2
00:10:47.136 --> 00:10:47.740
rowboat.

ae4cc88e-7743-476b-9207-f3e36204014b-0
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.427
But all of the row boats again
are very crowded. People trying

ae4cc88e-7743-476b-9207-f3e36204014b-1
00:10:56.427 --> 00:11:01.722
to escape either the ships being
shot or the sea monster and

ae4cc88e-7743-476b-9207-f3e36204014b-2
00:11:01.722 --> 00:11:06.930
they're trying to get to the
shore. It looks like one boat.

47c7b2d1-1284-4fe3-a9e9-d10dd6b1e03d-0
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.343
Made it to shore. It's fully on
shore one is getting there and

47c7b2d1-1284-4fe3-a9e9-d10dd6b1e03d-1
00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:13.930
they're in the process of
unloading people.

956e471d-027f-4301-b066-17796ca1f0c0-0
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.236
#END_being_a_pirate There's
another small rowboat. It looks

956e471d-027f-4301-b066-17796ca1f0c0-1
00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:24.446
like they're shooting at people
on shore. I see kind of a cannon

956e471d-027f-4301-b066-17796ca1f0c0-2
00:11:24.446 --> 00:11:26.130
with the smoke coming out.

2567920d-3dbd-4800-8452-e891f9c8f64b-0
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.230
This person has walked up into.

82643020-50eb-4ac5-9a21-fd1a8e25ea94-0
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:03.760
A sketchy looking area the
houses seem to the.

47833353-b8d3-4558-ac7d-bb74a6a5fadf-0
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.050
The shutters aren't right. A lot
of them are open. There are

47833353-b8d3-4558-ac7d-bb74a6a5fadf-1
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.631
people inside doing different
activities. One man is inside,

47833353-b8d3-4558-ac7d-bb74a6a5fadf-2
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:17.710
maybe sitting at a table or
watching TV.

2fcc2a8e-1f5b-426b-9f71-3332c54122eb-0
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.870
One man is looking over a book.

8a38f3a8-4ac1-4cf7-bd71-a1ac27b03f8c-0
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.788
There's another apartment and
the third floor. The shutters

8a38f3a8-4ac1-4cf7-bd71-a1ac27b03f8c-1
00:15:31.788 --> 00:15:37.041
are open. Smoke is coming out of
the houses. You can tell it's a

8a38f3a8-4ac1-4cf7-bd71-a1ac27b03f8c-2
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:37.930
cold night.

ad1c5ef8-37fe-4d0d-beee-fb931a60ed05-0
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.020
This person is walking through.

ad164b10-e439-4a15-8ad3-f50e8b9120ce-0
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.600
{Genext.}

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.580
So now it's.

f870585f-01f2-4523-b42d-4bde3ebc44ac-0
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.360
There's a house.

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-0
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.803
That this person has painted, so
now they're trying to bring

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-1
00:15:56.803 --> 00:16:01.496
color to this town. You can tell
that it's daylight now. The sun

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-2
00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:06.189
is up. There's a tree that looks
to have some color next to this

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-3
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:10.304
house. He's painting the
shutters. He seems to be taking

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-4
00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:14.780
care of his home amongst all of
these dilapidated places. But

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-5
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.040
other than this person, you
know, bringing color, everyone

1be11180-412e-49ef-a22e-a56c32ca8c87-6
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.000
else is still very Gray and dark
around.

9de11e9e-34fd-4eb9-9084-8a88d13ac51c-0

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.565
It looks like this old man has
taken care of his home and now

e36ef4f0-801a-4877-885c-6693173eb29b-1
00:16:31.565 --> 00:16:34.967
it's starting to spread that
color to other people. While

e36ef4f0-801a-4877-885c-6693173eb29b-2
00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:38.720
most people are still Gray and
without color, there is a little

e36ef4f0-801a-4877-885c-6693173eb29b-3
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.769
girl walking down the sidewalk
and she is in color.

b159d84e-b7d1-4916-b0f4-15864981b50f-0

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.628
And now you can tell that it was
slowly started to spread color

dc670bf2-c531-4922-81ab-43a8fcab3829-1
00:16:53.628 --> 00:16:58.240
all around the town. People are
more cheerful there.

d6c5f2d8-910f-4488-a2b2-705cf52f8d31-0
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:04.506
Places, you know, homes,
apartments that have color in

d6c5f2d8-910f-4488-a2b2-705cf52f8d31-1
00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:09.530
them. It's spreading to all of
that gloomy dark area.

c06af11e-7e8b-471a-814a-4c0aed700551-0
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.030

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.820
They continue to.

492524bf-e63a-4784-89a8-060566814be9-0
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.970
To share that with with their
neighbors.

926009c4-88f4-4f3c-9995-8aef55329fd8-0

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.581
And now the full town seems to
be alive and colorful and much

8ad8e1b6-f021-4194-adc0-7beb40227529-1
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:30.105
prettier. There's a milk truck
that's coming out for delivery,

8ad8e1b6-f021-4194-adc0-7beb40227529-2
00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:34.557
people are out on the street
enjoying life. There's an artist

8ad8e1b6-f021-4194-adc0-7beb40227529-3
00:17:34.557 --> 00:17:38.721
selling pictures, and there's a
little kid playing in the

8ad8e1b6-f021-4194-adc0-7beb40227529-4
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:43.029
fountain. There's a person
driving a car around, and people

8ad8e1b6-f021-4194-adc0-7beb40227529-5
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:46.907
are out. They seem to be
talking, interacting to each

8ad8e1b6-f021-4194-adc0-7beb40227529-6
00:17:46.907 --> 00:17:50.999
other, whereas before they were
very isolated, it seems.

6f6c2f2e-dc33-4f43-81eb-b2ce979cba40-0
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.426
In the apartments, you can tell
that people are together and not

6f6c2f2e-dc33-4f43-81eb-b2ce979cba40-1
00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:55.820
alone.

9f937c99-63b5-40d6-956b-80dae60e42e1-0
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.525
There's a balcony at the top of
one of the buildings and it

9f937c99-63b5-40d6-956b-80dae60e42e1-1
00:18:00.525 --> 00:18:04.197
seems to be a family. Together
they've continued to spread

9f937c99-63b5-40d6-956b-80dae60e42e1-2
00:18:04.197 --> 00:18:06.750
happiness and share all around
the town.

de9d34e3-3690-4beb-ad57-fe80e7d593e9-0
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.520

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.720
So.

380d77ee-3b9b-4499-b25d-687b6167918d-0
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.290
Now it seems maybe it's getting
to be.

06e80521-c007-46c2-a169-68ec57f97797-0
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.462
That towards dusk there are
people. On one rooftop, a

06e80521-c007-46c2-a169-68ec57f97797-1
00:18:29.462 --> 00:18:35.240
grandpa and his grandchildren
with a telescope looking at the

06e80521-c007-46c2-a169-68ec57f97797-2
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:35.800
stars.

f983994e-66e0-47dc-a9f1-eec75c03a843-0
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.238
There are two people out of
woman and a man. It seems

f983994e-66e0-47dc-a9f1-eec75c03a843-1
00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:45.781
they're on a date together.
There are people still walking

f983994e-66e0-47dc-a9f1-eec75c03a843-2
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:49.940
around and kids kind of kicking
ball down the street.

a11c1d6c-3491-4690-93b2-b4608fd339dd-0
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.414
A mother and a daughter and
older couple walking home,

a11c1d6c-3491-4690-93b2-b4608fd339dd-1
00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:56.060
possibly.

ad52db12-ba86-4426-a1d7-43666d3054cf-0
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.980
Everything is still in color and
seems happy.

28f201a8-9b72-4da7-aaa0-f1b1ba5159af-0
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.950
{Next one.}

baf4e38a-591e-40bf-ba3a-ca84bb00cf80-0
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.364
It seems that you know it is
getting darker. The street

baf4e38a-591e-40bf-ba3a-ca84bb00cf80-1
00:19:11.364 --> 00:19:15.414
lights have come on, but
everything is still in color.

baf4e38a-591e-40bf-ba3a-ca84bb00cf80-2
00:19:15.414 --> 00:19:19.612
Where the little boy was
standing on the balcony before,

baf4e38a-591e-40bf-ba3a-ca84bb00cf80-3
00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:24.178
he has his family with him now.
He's not alone any longer and

baf4e38a-591e-40bf-ba3a-ca84bb00cf80-4
00:19:24.178 --> 00:19:28.523
there are people out on the
street together. Fewer people,

baf4e38a-591e-40bf-ba3a-ca84bb00cf80-5
00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:29.260
but still.

732e10fa-514e-47c5-86fb-6fb53f1392d5-0
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.561
Sill a handful and the original
person that walked into town is

732e10fa-514e-47c5-86fb-6fb53f1392d5-1
00:19:35.561 --> 00:19:40.015
now turned the other way. It
looks like he's leaving town.

732e10fa-514e-47c5-86fb-6fb53f1392d5-2
00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:43.790
He's done his job and and made
it happier {next.}

a08a2255-a877-431d-9f6f-2968f7a53d07-0
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.160
It looks like this old man has
gone. He found another area that

a08a2255-a877-431d-9f6f-2968f7a53d07-1
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.649
is really dark and gloomy and
people seem isolated and he's by

a08a2255-a877-431d-9f6f-2968f7a53d07-2
00:19:55.649 --> 00:19:56.790
a street lights.

d38c5d2d-9c0a-4200-a14e-fe07ec660501-0
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.321
With a little it looks like a
little flame, so I would assume

d38c5d2d-9c0a-4200-a14e-fe07ec660501-1
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:08.060
he's there to light up the next
place, {the next one.}

bf9c783d-6ecd-4d9d-9b84-8cab3c17e929-0
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.164
#END_flowerman It's a little
girl with a flower. The old man

bf9c783d-6ecd-4d9d-9b84-8cab3c17e929-1
00:20:14.164 --> 00:20:18.076
has given her the flower and she
is in color. And then there's an

bf9c783d-6ecd-4d9d-9b84-8cab3c17e929-2
00:20:18.076 --> 00:20:21.809
old gentleman in the window that
looks like he has a flower as

bf9c783d-6ecd-4d9d-9b84-8cab3c17e929-3
00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:25.365
well. So as they spread these
flowers, that looks like it's

bf9c783d-6ecd-4d9d-9b84-8cab3c17e929-4
00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:27.380
spreading color and cheer
around.

have.}

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.120
{Pull it up.}

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:11.135
{OK, let me just make sure this
is the one I needed. OK, so this

38a3af1e-f71c-4e1f-b766-c4569bd1c4e9-1
00:21:11.135 --> 00:21:13.770
next story is 5 slides long.}

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.992
{I'm going to put it in present
mode and just same thing like I

6cd65654-54f7-448c-a816-02a17bde5fa8-1
00:21:17.992 --> 00:21:21.124
did before. Let me know when you
would like me to move forward,

6cd65654-54f7-448c-a816-02a17bde5fa8-2
00:21:21.124 --> 00:21:21.320
OK?}

056a9538-2546-41c2-8a5b-cbed4f0ad887-0
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.150
#START_arrival-1 So it looks
like.

1aac28e2-5808-4422-be84-17a68c854b88-0
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.250
There's a family.

175faed5-4e7b-4ff9-861a-53a6e5495639-0
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.642
Portrait being taken down from
the wall and a person is

175faed5-4e7b-4ff9-861a-53a6e5495639-1
00:21:32.642 --> 00:21:33.900
wrapping it up.

b4492041-0328-44d9-a67b-0040634b5980-0
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.826
Very carefully to put away in a
suitcase. It looks like maybe

b4492041-0328-44d9-a67b-0040634b5980-1
00:21:38.826 --> 00:21:42.593
they're they're taking it

efbef4cc-9791-4899-aaa2-3dd6dc05a470-0
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:01.345
It looks like they have. It's a
couple that's packing up a box

efbef4cc-9791-4899-aaa2-3dd6dc05a470-1
00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:03.560
and they have their items.

b34f3624-b277-4441-b8bf-3c8bf66cd25e-0
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.967
That they're moving, so they're
valuable possessions. The family

b34f3624-b277-4441-b8bf-3c8bf66cd25e-1
00:22:09.967 --> 00:22:15.005
photo teapot. They have their
clothing, hats, clock, and it

b34f3624-b277-4441-b8bf-3c8bf66cd25e-2
00:22:15.005 --> 00:22:17.439
looks like a little figurine.

0b87620b-25ef-4ec1-9292-3e175959c610-0
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.720
Cookware.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.921
You know a TV set there with
that, the teapot and their

8238b47a-f99e-4b07-857f-3d7d4b845403-1
00:22:25.921 --> 00:22:26.540
suitcase.

{Next.}

edbf6ebf-c648-4a37-b20a-f3c7a0785bf1-0
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.558
It looks like they are traveling
and it seems like a dangerous

edbf6ebf-c648-4a37-b20a-f3c7a0785bf1-1
00:22:40.558 --> 00:22:45.340
situation that they're they're
leaving and they have to go in

edbf6ebf-c648-4a37-b20a-f3c7a0785bf1-2
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.120
the nights their daughter was
woken up to leave.

b3dfda6e-d847-4d63-8c6a-c99e61ca097d-0
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.984
And they've they've gotten
dressed and then they're

b3dfda6e-d847-4d63-8c6a-c99e61ca097d-1
00:22:54.984 --> 00:22:58.560
fleeing. Like to go somewhere
else next.

894422f0-0c4c-46d4-9ae4-c40a2822ece2-0
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.936
So it looks like the wife and
husband are going to be

894422f0-0c4c-46d4-9ae4-c40a2822ece2-1
00:23:11.936 --> 00:23:15.430

away.

ede599f6-22e9-467f-aa5b-af584de15642-0
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.170
And there's a a train that they
have to catch.

e03af5d5-a40f-4739-af1d-4dfc7a76a039-0
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.880
And so they're saying their
goodbyes. It's very hard. The

e03af5d5-a40f-4739-af1d-4dfc7a76a039-1
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.614
dad is trying to stay positive
and strong for the mother and

e03af5d5-a40f-4739-af1d-4dfc7a76a039-2
00:23:28.614 --> 00:23:32.409
daughter, and he plays with the
daughter and shows the little

e03af5d5-a40f-4739-af1d-4dfc7a76a039-3
00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:33.450
figurine origami.

e02daeb4-b37f-4cdc-b92c-702776f80502-0
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.890
Under his hat.

29f65306-7ce3-486c-bff7-67a42db1fb76-0
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.584
The the wife is crying and very
sad. They're all holding hands

29f65306-7ce3-486c-bff7-67a42db1fb76-1
00:23:41.584 --> 00:23:43.240
and just saying goodbye.

681c2f20-ee09-4e3b-a6ed-8293e6e30ec9-0
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.100
{Do next.}

27651e17-8c2e-447e-a4a2-ff11fe6820cc-0
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.780
That looks like the.

320cb5c7-64be-4e0a-9ab0-bb5c880d893f-0
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.050
Dad has boarded a ship, so.

158f2f0d-84e2-4a02-8c80-cf9b9919889a-0
00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.782
He has the family picture, you
know, to remember his wife and

158f2f0d-84e2-4a02-8c80-cf9b9919889a-1
00:24:01.782 --> 00:24:02.610
daughter bye

#END_arrival-1 He is alone on
the ship ship, traveling by

00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:08.110
himself.

dc9bea53-edb4-4e12-92ee-4c6fe753e1cd-0
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.470
{Next, set it.}

a25cc0ca-2961-4864-9a44-87fd1327d57c-0
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.190
{Oh, let me see.}

129f127c-5521-4d24-bdd0-e98f72099de2-0
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.630
{OK, Next is a complex scene.}

c0146d3a-2959-48bb-94b3-88ee868bf7fc-0
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.197
{Same thing as before. You'll
have like 3 to 5 minutes to

c0146d3a-2959-48bb-94b3-88ee868bf7fc-1
00:24:37.197 --> 00:24:41.400
describe what you see happening
in this scene.}

bf80cfad-32c0-42e2-b40f-f99a28534d4b-0
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:48.958
{And you could start when you're
ready. } #START_airport OK. And

bf80cfad-32c0-42e2-b40f-f99a28534d4b-1
00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:54.390
so this looks like a where's
Waldo page. This is at an

bf80cfad-32c0-42e2-b40f-f99a28534d4b-2
00:24:54.390 --> 00:25:00.018
airport, so you have the
observation deck, and there are

bf80cfad-32c0-42e2-b40f-f99a28534d4b-3
00:25:00.018 --> 00:25:05.450
several aircraft around. It
looks like a UFO, a plane.

c66be18f-060f-4837-9470-a9c61ab8f268-0
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.940
Rocket A blimp even like a A.

942f5f67-b14f-4532-a454-c5ed418701f3-0
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.028
Base rockets or fighter jets. So
there's the old, you know,

942f5f67-b14f-4532-a454-c5ed418701f3-1
00:25:17.028 --> 00:25:19.730
original, like propeller plane.

09d179f5-55bb-4634-a6e9-f11f8523e675-0
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:27.970
Those are all in the air. On the
ground there is a hot air

09d179f5-55bb-4634-a6e9-f11f8523e675-1
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.990
balloon, a helicopter, there's a
large freight.

a3060827-13d6-4b9f-aa2a-f25586f9cca3-0
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.742
Jet that is being loaded up with
elephants and there are several

a3060827-13d6-4b9f-aa2a-f25586f9cca3-1
00:25:39.742 --> 00:25:43.870
different colors of planes on
the ground so.

1b59f248-2b3d-4cee-85e4-8f1c7990bad7-0
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.360
Most of them are are white, but
they have different stripes. So

1b59f248-2b3d-4cee-85e4-8f1c7990bad7-1
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.928
one has green stripe down the
middle and the tail ring is

1b59f248-2b3d-4cee-85e4-8f1c7990bad7-2
00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:59.574
green, another is blue, one is
yellow, one is red, there's

1b59f248-2b3d-4cee-85e4-8f1c7990bad7-3
00:25:59.574 --> 00:26:01.780
another green, another blue.

1dc2bc0a-01cd-4df0-94a4-acb68b2fc54b-0
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:08.150
There's one of those old planes
in the middle of the scene.

42cd746e-741b-45b6-ab79-4d349ea464a3-0
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:18.729
There are several workers
around, so loading cargo trying

42cd746e-741b-45b6-ab79-4d349ea464a3-1
00:26:18.729 --> 00:26:21.950
to direct sky traffic.

3db8236f-9c2b-4571-99bc-39c1b5349053-0
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.490
There is also a.

56dd9e73-b0d1-44e7-a604-833136cead0a-0
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.060
A fire engine in the middle of
all of this. It looks to be

56dd9e73-b0d1-44e7-a604-833136cead0a-1
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.125
spraying water on a group of
people, but there are a lot of

56dd9e73-b0d1-44e7-a604-833136cead0a-2
00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:42.840
people all around. Some are
boarding a bus.

44fd2442-6a03-42e8-ab13-6cf5caa3eaed-0
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.310
Some are around like a green
truck.

3ad5ad98-9403-45c8-8697-31c67ec5bdfd-0
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.877
There's also all of the people
loading luggage, so there's a

3ad5ad98-9403-45c8-8697-31c67ec5bdfd-1
00:26:55.877 --> 00:27:00.724
luggage cart in the center of
the scene at the bottom of the

3ad5ad98-9403-45c8-8697-31c67ec5bdfd-2
00:27:00.724 --> 00:27:05.413
page that's kind of inside the
airport and you can see the

3ad5ad98-9403-45c8-8697-31c67ec5bdfd-3
00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:10.339
ticket desk, crowds of people
ticket desk towards the middle.

3ad5ad98-9403-45c8-8697-31c67ec5bdfd-4
00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:13.280
The left bottom of the scene is
the.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.320
Luggage area with the belt that
goes around in a circle.

8172ee27-32ff-4525-9209-7cf7dbf95874-0
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.370
To the far right side, the
bottom it looks like.

935c2c14-b642-42d8-a7c4-b1f88f0303ee-0
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.890
Maybe that's where there's like
missing desk.

d1c21725-9cbe-4fb4-90fb-f6265aa5da5a-0
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:38.480
But there's very crowded
airport. Multiple people like

d1c21725-9cbe-4fb4-90fb-f6265aa5da5a-1
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.200
you can see air.

1a9dee52-c2ab-4db4-903b-e60cb89e55dc-0
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.300
Air flight attendants
passengers.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.720
Outside there's also like a.

6f46045e-67ff-45a1-99dc-a9aa9fee1656-0
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:02.886
There's one large plane in the
middle that's being deplaned,

6f46045e-67ff-45a1-99dc-a9aa9fee1656-1
00:28:02.886 --> 00:28:07.602
all the people leaving. To the
left of that, there's a red

6f46045e-67ff-45a1-99dc-a9aa9fee1656-2
00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:11.520
tanker truck with a hose out. It
looks like the.

b65e4dc8-1a7e-4b34-9240-88b517a9d088-0
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:17.130
Cargo like the luggage
transporter ran over his hose.

124ceccc-92f9-4646-97e3-3b0f5beba364-0
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.290
Umm.

ae74cac3-44ba-417e-82a1-2fd39e025d68-0
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.078
Below that is a forklift. Below
the main plane in the center is

ae74cac3-44ba-417e-82a1-2fd39e025d68-1
00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:35.490
a forklift. It literally has a
fork it's lifting up.

77f103c4-e332-4513-aa6d-7017c93a906a-0
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:42.042
Several boxes that are being
loaded while they're sitting

77f103c4-e332-4513-aa6d-7017c93a906a-1
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:44.930
there to be loaded, presumably.

c30601ea-cb39-48a4-ad6f-7a21edb0e386-0

5f88d17b-62b2-4a6c-be6d-412bbe532533-1
00:28:56.326 --> 00:28:57.190
separated.

26e5ecea-f4d6-43a0-9d23-9cc22bc37f67-0
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.760

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.810
{OK, next I have another complex
scene.}

62396aa4-f953-40bd-8876-766238e67213-0
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.610

b53bcd90-0701-4abc-ad66-ae18b23eb37d-0

#START_birthday_party_fun So
this is a birthday party

45e24505-277e-4258-93e8-25c9d29b34f8-0
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:39.090
The upper right hand side is a
large bouncy house. It's kind of

45e24505-277e-4258-93e8-25c9d29b34f8-1
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:45.435
a castle looking one has four
turrets and the middle is open,

00:29:45.435 --> 00:29:51.985
but you can tell that it's all
inflated. There are several kids

45e24505-277e-4258-93e8-25c9d29b34f8-3
00:29:51.985 --> 00:29:58.433
dressed up in costume. There's
the pink Bunny, a bat. It looks

45e24505-277e-4258-93e8-25c9d29b34f8-4
00:29:58.433 --> 00:30:02.220
like kind of a devil with Red
Wings.

a453d9f2-494c-48d0-87af-3595b8d6881c-0
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.070
Umm.

4e917e88-0db3-40f7-894f-ac6532581004-0
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:09.790
Iron Man, a crocodile, a witch.
But kids having fun in there.

71e6f4a7-57f2-443f-aa90-2ba90e0c165e-0
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.770
There are people all around in
the yard.

e40aaead-79ac-4130-868d-df2b90dfd14a-0
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:25.614
Kind of. In this backyard scene,
there's a large table with food

e40aaead-79ac-4130-868d-df2b90dfd14a-1
00:30:25.614 --> 00:30:28.530
set up that's towards the left.

c5f04865-a406-402e-b3e5-f53cf4257e08-0
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.391
Of that bouncy house. And
there's cakes and cupcakes that

c5f04865-a406-402e-b3e5-f53cf4257e08-1
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:39.421
looks like a salad and some sort
of mold in the middle. It's a

c5f04865-a406-402e-b3e5-f53cf4257e08-2
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:40.460
it's a large.

50f7a985-6e3c-4f64-bf98-cd083937bb4c-0
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.480
Object.

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-0
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.831
But a lot of people in costume.
You see a clown holding

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-1
00:30:48.831 --> 00:30:53.432
balloons. He has blue, red and
yellow balloon towards the

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-2
00:30:53.432 --> 00:30:57.874
middle of the page. Down at the
bottom there's a little

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-3
00:30:57.874 --> 00:31:02.237
inflatable pool. So kids are
playing in there. One boy

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-4
00:31:02.237 --> 00:31:06.996
dumping a bucket of water on
another girl that's dressed up

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-5
00:31:06.996 --> 00:31:11.596
as a mermaid. There's another
boy shooting a water gun at

c210b95a-9546-4003-afad-93f9d35e3790-6
00:31:11.596 --> 00:31:13.579
someone else in the yard.

1406bf38-e7db-4db9-bdfa-1038d978e763-0
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.043
And it looks like the entire
yard is surrounded by shrubs and

1406bf38-e7db-4db9-bdfa-1038d978e763-1
00:31:20.043 --> 00:31:21.380
a kind of a fence.

c51e35bb-6d7e-4a66-bdb4-cc0ae4c135c5-0
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.084
In the back with trees and
lanterns hanging from that, a

c51e35bb-6d7e-4a66-bdb4-cc0ae4c135c5-1
00:31:27.084 --> 00:31:31.478
flag like flag banners hanging
from all the trees as

c51e35bb-6d7e-4a66-bdb4-cc0ae4c135c5-2
00:31:31.478 --> 00:31:32.390
decoration.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.003
At the bottom, there's kids
playing with the hose next to

166fe2c4-7fe5-4713-8d0a-c75de824dfe6-1
00:31:41.003 --> 00:31:41.660
the pool.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:48.634
All different costumes of
fireman. Another witch looks

09e16df6-ac9d-44f4-8d7c-568fde6561c6-1
00:31:48.634 --> 00:31:49.770
like a fairy.

c4225a5a-4026-4a77-a2c5-2c395db72c4e-0
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.940
And a shepherd and a sheep.

b2951982-285c-4d5c-9f40-a41327c1f9b5-0
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:58.794
there are Kids also running
around kind of chasing each

b2951982-285c-4d5c-9f40-a41327c1f9b5-1
00:31:58.794 --> 00:32:02.130
other in the very middle part of
the page.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.455
The upper right, they're all
dressed as zoo characters, so a

6d204eed-3d57-48f3-9d3f-bbe8652c655e-1
00:32:10.455 --> 00:32:14.351
lion, zebra, Penguin, elephant,
and then the zookeeper there

6d204eed-3d57-48f3-9d3f-bbe8652c655e-2
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:14.990
with them.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.455
In the upper middle there's a
tree and underneath there are

0532557b-59d3-4ea5-86d5-d05d8db80b6b-1
00:32:23.455 --> 00:32:28.055
shrubs. There's one boy dressed
as a monster in the shrubs, kind

0532557b-59d3-4ea5-86d5-d05d8db80b6b-2
00:32:28.055 --> 00:32:31.310
of hiding out other kids playing
with swords.

aa658272-6165-4008-9448-12edfa283f80-0
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.970
Right below the shrubs.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.870
There is a man in the center
he's carrying.

f5b40344-8e1f-41c1-9c94-3c2848d47cc0-0
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.590
A birthday cake. It looks like a
3 tier birthday cake with lit

f5b40344-8e1f-41c1-9c94-3c2848d47cc0-1
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.744

he's taking that to the table

f5b40344-8e1f-41c1-9c94-3c2848d47cc0-2
00:32:47.744 --> 00:32:48.690

one.}

know when you'd like me to move

418e3e86-05db-432b-afa2-58e15a51fb3f-2

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.956
#START_wanderer It looks like 2
characters are putting together

1323160b-4595-45a7-a1c2-b5726941da22-1
00:34:23.956 --> 00:34:28.720
a paper boat on the left so
they're it's a life-size boat.

45da14fd-41df-42f7-9627-02645c6c2d93-0
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.636
The paper they're working
together, one is a horned

45da14fd-41df-42f7-9627-02645c6c2d93-1
00:34:33.636 --> 00:34:37.971
character, almost looks like a a
devil, and the other is, you

45da14fd-41df-42f7-9627-02645c6c2d93-2
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:39.720
know, an old old man and.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.030
But they have worked together to
form.

101044b0-4521-4129-a83f-8eac7b62c36d-0
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:49.470
This paper boats on the right is
a large.

645b6bcc-9564-4214-908c-bff4217bbd18-0
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:50.840
And.

2384ceef-1b74-4b20-a6b7-acd2f8851a99-0
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.674
Ship a large vessel, it has a
lot of sails on it, very big and

2384ceef-1b74-4b20-a6b7-acd2f8851a99-1
00:34:58.674 --> 00:35:00.490
it has underneath.

14a81aff-795f-49e0-b4af-7b0672f09545-0
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:07.896
Kind of like a observation area
with this little paper boat on

14a81aff-795f-49e0-b4af-7b0672f09545-1
00:35:07.896 --> 00:35:08.780
the water.

5a97b06a-2280-413e-a0b8-531214057b42-0
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:10.700
{Next.}

93bf4847-8f8d-4738-8f2a-79de806ddcf3-0
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.152
You can see the paper boat
making their way through the

93bf4847-8f8d-4738-8f2a-79de806ddcf3-1
00:35:17.152 --> 00:35:19.840
rough seas and there's birds
flying over.

48042b5e-9453-49b0-8a00-2a6a19bb5905-0
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.430
This little paper boats just
sailing by and next.

7cab8aa9-6c83-4ce3-a5a0-cbbd879ddec1-0
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:37.341
So now this paper boat has come
up upon a large whale that's in

7cab8aa9-6c83-4ce3-a5a0-cbbd879ddec1-1
00:35:37.341 --> 00:35:38.080
the sea.

ab30eb04-0204-453b-abfd-0d5f2cbdb595-0
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.986
And also looks like you know
it's encountering sea life. So

ab30eb04-0204-453b-abfd-0d5f2cbdb595-1
00:35:44.986 --> 00:35:47.750
turtles, a bird has landed on
it.

0e77a68c-95d9-4f8d-8daf-6d9f8db3c43d-0
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.410
And it looks very small compared
to this whale {next.}

883bbf7f-d82c-4657-8c7e-6e4d8bf5cafa-0
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:03.142
You can see all of the creatures
underneath the water, so the

883bbf7f-d82c-4657-8c7e-6e4d8bf5cafa-1
00:36:03.142 --> 00:36:06.970
whale has lifted up this little
paper boat.

4f944778-21d3-4507-8caf-15e0b59cc891-0
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:15.067
From it it's side and you can
see all the coral underneath the

4f944778-21d3-4507-8caf-15e0b59cc891-1
00:36:15.067 --> 00:36:20.440
schools of fish, it looks like a
swordfish is swimming by.

bbfc69e8-f715-476a-b78e-cb045d62ac7e-0
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:22.900
{Next.}

6aa7eb13-b669-463a-b2c0-2ae4eda54a9e-0
00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.550
Now this little paper boats.

2d0347d8-0078-4372-aafa-c84019d78bc9-0
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.023
It looks to be going. The fish
are kind of carrying this boat

2d0347d8-0078-4372-aafa-c84019d78bc9-1
00:36:35.023 --> 00:36:35.510
along.

a2474922-2dbd-4c9f-b870-843e8d7b8811-0
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.720
There's a large number, a large
school of fish.

b23b05e8-ab2f-4190-873e-c900ec991947-0
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.280
And then?

10c6a6e6-2d81-4962-b988-36e625f4e04f-0
00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.950
The little paper boat is not
there.

f784e45d-f2fc-458a-98e7-894f6b448a2a-0
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.730
{Next.}

5d5ab23d-5a88-49df-98c4-89a7e66b07a4-0
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.380
So now it looks like this paper
boat.

fb0df548-ab34-47af-9976-d05000a438a6-0
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.114
Has made it away from all of the
fish. It's over coral now.

fb0df548-ab34-47af-9976-d05000a438a6-1
00:37:03.114 --> 00:37:05.640
There's little squid next to it.

974f4ad5-8764-46b6-be13-f7dc148af123-0
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.539
Now it seems that the the
characters are fishing. There's

974f4ad5-8764-46b6-be13-f7dc148af123-1
00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:11.700
a.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.510
A fishing pole and line dangling
from the side of this little

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.650

You can see all of the plants
that are growing up, their roots

5c5ffdf8-75e2-4979-a266-2e55722866bc-1
00:37:57.115 --> 00:37:59.650

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:33.286
A horned caped creature leading
the way. In this he has other

they're kind of being guided by.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.780
And now this little paper boat
is being overtaken by a huge

d3b2db54-5cfe-443c-9e3a-5eeb1b427116-1
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.190

The shell vessel, the kite, has
been ripped open.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.140
The creatures are still on that,
but this wave is crashing over

197ceb87-d9b8-4b76-90fb-876dcc842875-1
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.830

now, it looks like there's a
storm the paper boat made it

d8a9a18d-dc5a-4ee7-97fe-141e860f63f3-1
00:45:24.911 --> 00:45:28.030

crashing down.

00:46:01.259 --> 00:46:03.870

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.480
The boat made it out of the Eels
and now it looks like a

d95bdc61-5573-4c9e-bf9d-39794753b006-0
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:17.454

So now the paper boat is
underwater and it's surrounded

0afe4ce9-1b79-4f5d-be9f-1c0d121f5742-1
00:46:43.396 --> 00:46:44.210

00:47:20.033 --> 00:47:24.585

is draining from this paper

99c810d5-e5bc-4d1b-9358-5137662b4788-2
00:47:44.543 --> 00:47:49.380

half half ship and half.

It looks like the paper boat has
made its way to.

f867eda7-8b98-460c-bc07-3c2f8f10db6e-0
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:59.163
Maybe a river? A smaller water
passageway that's going through

f867eda7-8b98-460c-bc07-3c2f8f10db6e-1
00:51:59.163 --> 00:51:59.840

Bridges that go over the water
and the little paper boat is

a477af99-4f77-4bac-a31c-20fcfe1ba68d-1
00:52:09.661 --> 00:52:11.790

So this little paper boat
continues to float its passing

And the creatures that it ran
into previously and the shell

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:29.019

little paper boat is just

00:52:38.419 --> 00:52:40.990

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.623
Paper boat is still is still
floating through. It looks like

00:52:50.623 --> 00:52:54.380
it's headed out of the city now
and it's night time.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:30.980
The left side of the page it
looks like.

15b296f2-7fa0-40a1-80a4-6d6fbd07e798-0
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:39.220
A volcano with several Cavemen
around.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.400
There are dinosaurs.

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:46.240
If you look at the very top.

486169ca-5ffe-4b73-a418-12675f16ff32-0
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.542
It's theatrical lights hanging
down. There are dinosaurs kind

486169ca-5ffe-4b73-a418-12675f16ff32-1
00:54:52.542 --> 00:54:57.082
of coming down from this volcano
of various colors. There's

486169ca-5ffe-4b73-a418-12675f16ff32-2
00:54:57.082 --> 00:55:01.774
green. One green dinosaur has a
spikes on its back. There's a

486169ca-5ffe-4b73-a418-12675f16ff32-3
00:55:01.774 --> 00:55:06.088
pink dinosaur that also has
spikes on its back down from

00:55:06.088 --> 00:55:09.040
that a blue dinosaur to red
dinosaurs.

2f5908bb-be75-4eae-9181-feef3cb357b6-0

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.840
Very bottom. It looks like it's
the dressing room for this

31a6f6cc-21a8-414a-b8d8-175d1e2b764c-1
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.700

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:31.647
mirrors and like a vanity
counter. Three changing rooms,

31a6f6cc-21a8-414a-b8d8-175d1e2b764c-3
00:55:31.647 --> 00:55:36.768

their dinosaur.

56cf03b1-5cbf-4790-8cfe-a9d7ef8e3bdf-0
00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:43.680
And then in the middle of the
page it looks like a smaller

56cf03b1-5cbf-4790-8cfe-a9d7ef8e3bdf-1
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:43.940
set.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:52.783
That has maybe like zombies. It
looks like a Halloween scene, so

02a208b7-b9da-4ff6-9877-21f6baa6dc31-1
00:55:52.783 --> 00:55:57.320
there's lights, large theatrical
lights there.

f556330b-a225-4628-95b8-01c9020614a7-0
00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:07.038
Mummy's acting out. It's a
crowded scene. To the right is a

00:56:07.038 --> 00:56:09.540
different stage area.

67981aa4-2bd8-4efd-8868-61275b1ad116-0
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.744
It looks like a a cafeteria,
actually. It might just be where

67981aa4-2bd8-4efd-8868-61275b1ad116-1
00:56:14.744 --> 00:56:18.406
everyone's taking a break and
eating, and there are several

67981aa4-2bd8-4efd-8868-61275b1ad116-2
00:56:18.406 --> 00:56:22.006
tables and everyone gathered
around it looks like a buffet

67981aa4-2bd8-4efd-8868-61275b1ad116-3
00:56:22.006 --> 00:56:23.960
line where they're getting food.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.700
Outside of that, so just up on
the page.

bc88fe82-e82a-4aae-b41f-85727723c3e3-0
00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:37.540
It's a space scene, so that
stage is set up with spaceships.

96e0f920-08d5-4bab-9871-c74123453a94-0
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:43.778
Looks like 4 spaceships. It
looks like a crashed rocket, so

96e0f920-08d5-4bab-9871-c74123453a94-1
00:56:43.778 --> 00:56:44.970
maybe like a.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.690
A scene for a landing.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.650
Everyone there is dressed up.

And.

d56882ed-6887-41af-87f3-76ad1e6a179d-0

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:12.907
there between the two stages.
With the dinosaurs and Cavemen

d56882ed-6887-41af-87f3-76ad1e6a179d-2
00:57:12.907 --> 00:57:17.955
and the space scene, it looks
like crowds of people just all

d56882ed-6887-41af-87f3-76ad1e6a179d-3
00:57:17.955 --> 00:57:20.520
all working on this production.

18f31028-4a7c-4c9f-8d61-738b0d4c8853-0

OK?}

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.070
{OK, this one's also a complex
scene.}

4c7aef1c-218f-48fc-83fc-e2e0cb34023c-0
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.370
#START_waldo-1 OK, so this scene
is.

6760b1f4-9d04-4efe-a49e-d4d8c7137355-0
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:09.385
Like a village scene, in the
middle is a fountain. The water

6760b1f4-9d04-4efe-a49e-d4d8c7137355-1
00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:14.910
is on and spraying up. There's a
man in kind of diving gear with

6760b1f4-9d04-4efe-a49e-d4d8c7137355-2
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:16.100
a snorkel and.

9de09f37-b5ee-454a-bf49-5370c23ffb42-0
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:23.100
The fins on and floating in the
water and that's in a triangle.

6ecdff56-6ca7-41c5-b586-96982073014f-0
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:29.840
And then around that is a a road
with cars, so.

0eb70210-c6f5-4776-a4a2-8213a3a24f46-0
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:36.326
There's a red car and a yellow
truck. It looks like the red car

0eb70210-c6f5-4776-a4a2-8213a3a24f46-1
00:58:36.326 --> 00:58:40.605
ran into the back of the truck
that's just above the fountain

0eb70210-c6f5-4776-a4a2-8213a3a24f46-2
00:58:40.605 --> 00:58:44.607
and people are out and about.
The two drivers are kind of

0eb70210-c6f5-4776-a4a2-8213a3a24f46-3
00:58:44.607 --> 00:58:47.230
yelling at each other, it looks
like.

56c1ba91-b707-4395-8866-7f76a227887a-0
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:55.080
Around this fountain square, um,
our buildings. So there appears

56c1ba91-b707-4395-8866-7f76a227887a-1
00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:01.431
to be a cafe, maybe like that's
on the right. It looks like a a

56c1ba91-b707-4395-8866-7f76a227887a-2
00:59:01.431 --> 00:59:05.600
Barber there next to it, and a
bookstore.

97052107-e70f-4763-a278-8d9205aaaf73-0
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:08.720
In that little block.

a5c71b48-b283-46d3-84ae-25c32701cff1-0
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:17.586
There is either a theater or a a
church. Maybe people going in

a5c71b48-b283-46d3-84ae-25c32701cff1-1
00:59:17.586 --> 00:59:18.170
that.

0266f1a8-b4ca-4673-8ea7-2d34b41abb28-0
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:25.035
Below the fountain square and it
looks like an open market, so

0266f1a8-b4ca-4673-8ea7-2d34b41abb28-1
00:59:25.035 --> 00:59:28.630
there are stands with the
striped awnings.

6bc9c496-5f68-4220-8c4c-e5b7e4f5d2fd-0
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.558
And have a crowd of people. It
looks like 1 stand is selling

6bc9c496-5f68-4220-8c4c-e5b7e4f5d2fd-1

01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:55.210

So the man and the son.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:09.147
Various items that looks like
items from the sea. Shrimp,

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.730
And they do offer it looks like
a a cucumber the man is eating

24e64c85-3f98-4a16-b2e8-99442083dde8-1
01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:25.476
that they feed the creature that
the man is also traveling with.

24e64c85-3f98-4a16-b2e8-99442083dde8-2
01:08:25.476 --> 01:08:29.200
In this basket they put all the
items for the man.

602d6da6-c54a-4f0f-8463-35c466898405-0
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:32.810

This man.

e7afc968-2250-477c-9e5e-a6154dbbe63b-0
01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:48.872

01:08:54.205 --> 01:08:59.801
and the boy. They look and the
boy pulls out this creature with

e7afc968-2250-477c-9e5e-a6154dbbe63b-3
01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:04.260
the spiky tail that kind of
looks like an owl cat.

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:09.977
Or dragon, and then that dragon
creature and the creature the

a966ee65-82fb-49e1-8675-10cba78c871c-1
01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:13.900

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:29.110
And the traveling man jots down
this interaction in his book.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:25.644
#START_return There's an
apartment, it looks like, with

00ab3218-1bf3-4149-89ff-0e2466f282ac-1
01:10:25.644 --> 01:10:30.471
several rooms in the building.
There's a man at a drawing table

00ab3218-1bf3-4149-89ff-0e2466f282ac-2
01:10:30.471 --> 01:10:34.620
and there's a a red kite that is
in the room with him.

5ba85a93-1b9c-4d8f-b2bc-d7168e94e8b3-0
01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:39.608
There's also a little boy
downstairs playing and it looks

5ba85a93-1b9c-4d8f-b2bc-d7168e94e8b3-1
01:10:39.608 --> 01:10:43.560
like he's drawing a red door on
the wall. He's wearing a crown

5ba85a93-1b9c-4d8f-b2bc-d7168e94e8b3-2
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.000

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.791
Man at the drawing desk, he
notices the kite has fallen down

fb22d37b-626d-47d7-8c87-cfe3eb1e1626-1
01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.680
and he picks up this kite.

39a14bdf-c0a5-4ea4-a711-bdb816d23ab9-0
01:10:56.370 --> 01:11:00.835
Looks at that and then he goes
downstairs to the little boys

39a14bdf-c0a5-4ea4-a711-bdb816d23ab9-1
01:11:00.835 --> 01:11:05.227
room and finds this red door
that the boy has drawn and the

39a14bdf-c0a5-4ea4-a711-bdb816d23ab9-2
01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:07.350
door opens. The man looks in 

81906e04-5cb6-4f52-a2ed-c97f6720b263-0
01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:16.999
He comes across this forest of
trees with lanterns that are lit

81906e04-5cb6-4f52-a2ed-c97f6720b263-1
01:11:16.999 --> 01:11:21.820
and a little stream. It's a
different world outside of the

81906e04-5cb6-4f52-a2ed-c97f6720b263-2
01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.210
apartment {next.}

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:33.663
On this stream is a ship that
has like a dragon head and a

90166b06-feda-4827-a31a-3dda264a3836-1
01:11:33.663 --> 01:11:40.865
fanned tail, and the middle is
flat. So the man goes from the

90166b06-feda-4827-a31a-3dda264a3836-2
01:11:40.865 --> 01:11:44.350
dock and he gets on this ship.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.310
That this takes him to.

41f4149b-7f29-40aa-86b0-8945c8983722-0
01:11:57.490 --> 01:11:59.850
A city that's like a a castle.

81856ca2-2a94-4752-8a29-61e03f6394fe-0
01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.700
And there's a several bridges.

8749f5f1-f1c5-45e4-bdaa-5609799863e3-0
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:10.365
There are large overlooks and
turrets and round domes and

8749f5f1-f1c5-45e4-bdaa-5609799863e3-1
01:12:10.365 --> 01:12:15.243
little flags, and the moon is
bright and shining over this

8749f5f1-f1c5-45e4-bdaa-5609799863e3-2
01:12:15.243 --> 01:12:15.740
place.

ef444ef0-74ba-4258-b4e0-3e2c50bff353-0
01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.630
as the man looks on

94b7edd8-38fd-4ae6-8720-7d89b2eb8335-0

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:27.803
So the man gets off the ship and
he's flagging down people. He

664cefc0-25fe-4c1d-88cd-40e4f3ea8187-1
01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:30.520
sees the boy that was wearing
the crown.

abecff71-12de-4082-ae6f-1bbfaf24e1bb-0
01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:36.080
And he he goes to this king, it
appears.

a12c9c5b-f341-48b7-99c1-69cae60d0c5b-0
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:38.140
And.

a2e0e56c-45e2-4d2a-88ed-9896670a83ad-0
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:42.380
The boy doesn't want to go home
with him. He's saying no.

5dc7d222-1e20-4975-879e-1e4245c2f9e5-0

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.830
And they look over and there's
another ship.

5f6ecc1c-7597-4deb-aa0d-0b710cc7d1d5-0
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.480
With other people coming up
towards them.

2a442b81-48d0-4415-a66c-ed6bed0e45fa-0

616e5b70-8440-4a16-ab16-a1d22771c378-0
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:08.720
There is a fight that ensues
between these other people and

616e5b70-8440-4a16-ab16-a1d22771c378-1
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.660
the king, and the King wields
his sword, and these other

616e5b70-8440-4a16-ab16-a1d22771c378-2
01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.120
soldiers are they knock it out
of his arms. They're taking the

616e5b70-8440-4a16-ab16-a1d22771c378-3
01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.760
king and they they take this
that he has.

fc6e7f4a-6d6f-4d24-9b70-b87aa53974bf-0
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.740
It's the box next.

230aa5c1-73fd-41a2-827f-e971f3534304-0
01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:35.943
So the boy wearing the Crown
draws a wing. He's drawing a

230aa5c1-73fd-41a2-827f-e971f3534304-1
01:13:35.943 --> 01:13:41.248
purple like Griffin Dragon to
take them away from these other

230aa5c1-73fd-41a2-827f-e971f3534304-2
01:13:41.248 --> 01:13:46.554
men, these soldiers that came
up. And so this dragon comes to

230aa5c1-73fd-41a2-827f-e971f3534304-3
01:13:46.554 --> 01:13:51.089
life and they fly off together
over the moon {next.}

e8793f8d-26df-44ea-903c-38a9b553dd6e-0
01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.286
As they're flying and they're
fleeing and these other men,

e8793f8d-26df-44ea-903c-38a9b553dd6e-1
01:13:58.286 --> 01:14:02.650
they're going high in the sky
above the city and above all the

e8793f8d-26df-44ea-903c-38a9b553dd6e-2
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:03.620
all the water.

9bbbfed7-85e0-4abe-b1f7-70bd745bed46-0
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.720
It appears that the.

c53b7c1b-37e5-4688-8d04-c0a1d8c9a371-0
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:13.383
The king has been taken captive
by the soldiers and they are on

c53b7c1b-37e5-4688-8d04-c0a1d8c9a371-1
01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:18.981
the ship which also has wings,
so they are flying after them

c53b7c1b-37e5-4688-8d04-c0a1d8c9a371-2
01:14:18.981 --> 01:14:19.440
next.

c02a548a-c87e-4f09-b903-884a0fd99f3a-0
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:24.640
So this ship.

02d54c77-60f3-4792-9a29-e0ffb16e5259-0
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:33.580
Meets up with the Dragon, and
the King tries to take the boy.

58ae81b0-bc46-4c4f-9e35-d8309796785e-0
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.581
And then the boy and the father
are falling through the sky. The

58ae81b0-bc46-4c4f-9e35-d8309796785e-1
01:14:41.581 --> 01:14:46.290
Dragon has poofed into feathers,
and they're falling down next.

aa2c04f4-4a3d-4a7a-83f3-7abac8980266-0
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.920
So they fall under the water.

c1fc012c-3a31-4ce0-ac7a-9f4d4c62ec4d-0
01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:58.038
And so now they're surrounded by
by fish, and the boy draws in

c1fc012c-3a31-4ce0-ac7a-9f4d4c62ec4d-1
01:14:58.038 --> 01:14:58.410

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:07.733
He's drawn a red submarine, so
now they're safe in a submarine,

8f1795b0-938e-4cdc-aade-e883bc817cfb-1
01:15:07.733 --> 01:15:11.010
underwater and traveling through

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.970
The submarine takes them to an
under ground.

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:32.121
So now in The Cave they see
these old drawings left there

93bb8736-5176-4878-b1eb-a369ac2192d3-1
01:15:32.121 --> 01:15:38.275
and people with light people it
looks like with something coming

93bb8736-5176-4878-b1eb-a369ac2192d3-2
01:15:38.275 --> 01:15:44.145
out of a bucket the the boys

01:23:05.287 --> 01:23:10.490
him. And then he's also at what
looks like a an airport sort of

cb0b047c-81c1-4eda-a189-3f1e88f72dba-3
01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:13.009
place talking to people {next.}

3f96e94b-30ed-45be-861e-9974b4d8ac3a-0
01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:15.620


0e3ee7ab-c484-4338-8f51-6641dbefc04d-0
01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:35.660


26d2f76a-9998-4395-82e8-eafc4b79a7a8-0
01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.190
{Oh, sorry, Megan, I can't hear
you.}

c70eb36c-1471-414f-9c90-fbd83517806b-0
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:54.091
{Sorry, this one's a complex
scene, so this one is just like

c70eb36c-1471-414f-9c90-fbd83517806b-1
01:23:54.091 --> 01:23:58.492
the three to five minutes to
describe what you see. OK, here

c70eb36c-1471-414f-9c90-fbd83517806b-2
01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:00.079
and I will make this.}

7f2377ef-a407-4e1d-98cc-80b1a607d675-0
01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.110
{Bigger there we go.}

663f2ea2-7f48-4cbc-8407-9e320f14b96e-0
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.730
#START_exhibit-12 Right, so this
looks to be.

97f01835-eb89-465c-b7f7-5e729e9178bf-0
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:17.688
Almost like a an Art Museum,
there are portraits hanging on

97f01835-eb89-465c-b7f7-5e729e9178bf-1
01:24:17.688 --> 01:24:22.928
the walls. It is very crowded,
so in this museum there are

97f01835-eb89-465c-b7f7-5e729e9178bf-2
01:24:22.928 --> 01:24:27.990
three levels with a set of
stairs separating each one on

97f01835-eb89-465c-b7f7-5e729e9178bf-3
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:29.499
the bottom floor.

1a5993a0-32ff-4dc9-9fc9-8eadb81f4283-0
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.410
There is.

7ee0b817-1c9d-4866-9d92-db590e6b3d38-0
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:43.280
A large portrait, sort of in the
center and with a horse and.

ab936854-d5ea-4941-8259-9d73507da289-0
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.617
It looks like that's being
painted. There are several

ab936854-d5ea-4941-8259-9d73507da289-1
01:24:47.617 --> 01:24:51.810
pictures on the walls. The walls
are red, the floors are white.

0e81cdb8-b028-4e02-b618-74c1ac7db50f-0
01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.220
Umm.

2e1c70ab-e760-49c8-90bb-b8910f471737-0
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.570
Each.

84d8feef-b516-4d31-951a-59a422519d86-0
01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:01.738
The the second and third floor
have like white rails as well

84d8feef-b516-4d31-951a-59a422519d86-1
01:25:01.738 --> 01:25:02.840
going around.

638107ed-d117-4b42-8c58-e44d44045c5c-0
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:09.438
So on that first floor, there's
one doorway opening, and it

638107ed-d117-4b42-8c58-e44d44045c5c-1
01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:10.380
looks like.

8a9d141e-646b-4fcd-a117-572498282d73-0
01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.791
Police are trying to come
through with a mob of people

8a9d141e-646b-4fcd-a117-572498282d73-1
01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:15.470
behind them.

54f8b614-84fb-462e-a829-28fa782ad2c0-0
01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:21.528
To the right there are people
taking portraits off the wall

54f8b614-84fb-462e-a829-28fa782ad2c0-1
01:25:21.528 --> 01:25:25.896
and passing them up to the
second floor. There's a portrait

54f8b614-84fb-462e-a829-28fa782ad2c0-2
01:25:25.896 --> 01:25:29.610
being passed on the the main
level amongst people.

e04a8bb1-c891-4c45-bc0c-d7bb2f0f497f-0
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:36.149
A lot of crowds and it looks
like a little scaffolding that

e04a8bb1-c891-4c45-bc0c-d7bb2f0f497f-1
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:39.430
they're walking on on the main
floor.

16d3f562-0de2-428b-9a9f-d7c254a5eb8b-0
01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.874
So they can reach the 2nd floor
and going up the steps to that

16d3f562-0de2-428b-9a9f-d7c254a5eb8b-1
01:25:44.874 --> 01:25:49.139
second floor. This is on the
left hand side of the screen,

16d3f562-0de2-428b-9a9f-d7c254a5eb8b-2
01:25:49.139 --> 01:25:49.790
the page.

86887aab-3c2d-4209-a656-3839d56e9acb-0
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.403
People are passing portraits up,
so there's like gold, a gold

86887aab-3c2d-4209-a656-3839d56e9acb-1
01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:04.765
frame, a a green frame, another
gold or red frame and portraits

86887aab-3c2d-4209-a656-3839d56e9acb-2
01:26:04.765 --> 01:26:07.350
still hanging on the wall.

6c3b04c7-88fe-482f-aec7-9c9aea3ca9f0-0
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:11.840
On the second floor.

97cc108d-58b1-4626-8c9f-0b3b7a90debf-0
01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:18.410
It seems even more crowded. And
there's a ladder and.

bb2633ff-1a89-4c64-9efc-5ad794c8a3ac-0
01:26:20.410 --> 01:26:23.881
People hanging off of the
there's two ladders, people

bb2633ff-1a89-4c64-9efc-5ad794c8a3ac-1
01:26:23.881 --> 01:26:27.675
hanging off 2 ladders on the
left and then kind of hanging

bb2633ff-1a89-4c64-9efc-5ad794c8a3ac-2
01:26:27.675 --> 01:26:30.440
platforms. There are people
there as well.

885d54a2-bb85-4635-9f3c-f6adfd173d4e-0
01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:33.870
And so.

42cdb53e-ed34-4c1d-945a-a7c55f01b3c6-0
01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:39.932
Pictures of portraits all along
these walls, also on the second

42cdb53e-ed34-4c1d-945a-a7c55f01b3c6-1
01:26:39.932 --> 01:26:40.430
floor.

b89c8167-b42a-4475-a062-080727ef5435-0
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:45.390
There are people trying to take
the portraits.

6bc46b78-67e5-4430-b104-4d462457618f-0
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:51.530
There are more people carrying
portraits up to the third floor.

0fd1bfa7-78d2-4dd8-b9bc-c4abe64d8326-0
01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.420
Umm.

5f7c9435-80c8-4b6c-9e08-051ba44c04ec-0
01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:58.481
And it looks like that wall is
higher. It has several portraits

5f7c9435-80c8-4b6c-9e08-051ba44c04ec-1
01:26:58.481 --> 01:27:02.075
hanging and there's also
scaffolding and multi layer

5f7c9435-80c8-4b6c-9e08-051ba44c04ec-2
01:27:02.075 --> 01:27:04.450
scaffolding of people hanging
off.

8c6b004f-66bf-43ca-af73-d97b726182ea-0
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.413
#END_exhibit-12 But very
crowded. It's hard to make out

8c6b004f-66bf-43ca-af73-d97b726182ea-1
01:27:11.413 --> 01:27:13.960
individual costumes or or
people.
