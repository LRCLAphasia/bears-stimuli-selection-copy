{OK, so.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.840
This is session 2.

c7d311d0-aa4f-4391-bc1d-b28a1e4323d0-0
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.906
Can you see two types of
pictures in the study? The first

c7d311d0-aa4f-4391-bc1d-b28a1e4323d0-1
00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:17.056
type is a complex scene and
describe it in as much detail as

c7d311d0-aa4f-4391-bc1d-b28a1e4323d0-2
00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:20.730
you can and take between three
and five minutes, OK?}

94c6deca-1cf3-4452-88e5-1da29c6dcc68-0
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.600
{And you can start when you're
ready.}

4e1e990e-a771-4af4-8001-7ca8e789eff6-0
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.630
#START_birthday_party_fun OK.
This is a birthday party scene.

11f2bbff-ffd5-4933-a845-43c998f9b751-0
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.360
Once again, lots of people. Lots
of.

2543bca4-26ce-46c8-96db-900769065d19-0
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.020
children as well as family as
well as.

eea8cbe5-69ed-40c5-88ee-977806a92d8a-0
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.000
Many people dressed in costumes.

b52bd9e8-231d-4ada-9244-c40e5bd9d2a7-0
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.753
There are many activities taking
place. To the right of the the

b52bd9e8-231d-4ada-9244-c40e5bd9d2a7-1
00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:58.810
page there is a bouncing castle.

191b0088-6649-462d-895c-2a5c94df01ac-0
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.277
Many of those who are bouncing
are in costumes I see Spiderman

191b0088-6649-462d-895c-2a5c94df01ac-1
00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:13.376
or bat or rabbit frog as well as
people sliding down from the the

191b0088-6649-462d-895c-2a5c94df01ac-2
00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:14.130
castle.

751f58a9-d976-4f30-a9d6-609e5421512b-0
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.840
There are people who are dressed
in animals.

638703e6-30fd-4b75-b056-dcf6bdda5cd0-0
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.650
Elephants, giraffe, lions.

3912fc00-6b27-4cec-9715-8f76c4d13d35-0
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.540
I see a clown.

1415096e-5130-45e3-ae3c-b32d83d04991-0
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.164
I guess. But the clown is
actually looking more serious

1415096e-5130-45e3-ae3c-b32d83d04991-1
00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:34.550
than the rest of the the people.

ec06f000-e0d4-4ff5-b50b-a033cd972306-0
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.960
I see.

998b7462-b4a2-49e5-bf82-e2901cf847d2-0
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.737
Witch, as well as a Princess,
there's a group of people

998b7462-b4a2-49e5-bf82-e2901cf847d2-1
00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:48.340
playing in an inflatable pool.

9f935434-d194-454a-9fde-e4f2b3757136-0
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.485
Which suggests this must be
sometime in the summer or in

9f935434-d194-454a-9fde-e4f2b3757136-1
00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:59.954
early fall. It is taking place
outdoors in some kind of a

9f935434-d194-454a-9fde-e4f2b3757136-2
00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:05.518
either a park or somebody's
home. There is, there seems to

9f935434-d194-454a-9fde-e4f2b3757136-3
00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:11.460
be a house next to the party, so
it could be somebody's house.

b4760d5b-ea63-48f1-a356-5e5236a70397-0
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.658
To there's a table that has a
lot of food for the guests,

b4760d5b-ea63-48f1-a356-5e5236a70397-1
00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:20.980
including a.

2ad18bc8-fab9-4062-9a8b-56b4f19ae8cd-0
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.720
A couple of cupcakes and a
birthday cake.

b53278c2-2e45-4c5e-9394-8de3da0ff2b2-0
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.110
There are angels and fairy tale
fairy fairy princesses.

69801fde-761d-45bf-9f98-9d8ad62d9651-0
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.860
There's also a an activity that
is taking place with a.

f3ca1547-c728-44ff-b9d4-cf8b5bcb888a-0
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.860
Yes, that's called a it's it's
slamming a paper mache.

8970f457-2796-47d2-93d5-45242b5a18ac-0
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.993
With blindfolds I can't my my
mind is disappearing as to what

8970f457-2796-47d2-93d5-45242b5a18ac-1
00:02:49.993 --> 00:02:51.660
you call this actual game.

152be76f-1ef3-4096-b85e-932366e8b9d6-0
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.195
But it's close to a tree because
the the paper mache is is hooked

152be76f-1ef3-4096-b85e-932366e8b9d6-1
00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:04.593
to a tree. There's also like a
tug of war that's taking place

152be76f-1ef3-4096-b85e-932366e8b9d6-2
00:03:04.593 --> 00:03:05.290
between.

f4cac129-90bd-4088-9f65-2b46ad3ac1f6-0
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.700
the Group.

6ddad19a-5146-4e0c-8a90-ed445d777005-0
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.254
And it seems right now they are
both competing to push the other

6ddad19a-5146-4e0c-8a90-ed445d777005-1
00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:22.124
down. There's like 112344 4
people on each side. There's

6ddad19a-5146-4e0c-8a90-ed445d777005-2
00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:27.480
also a table close to the
entrance where there are.

2f661853-da81-4038-b8e4-eca36710a489-0
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.860
Um, putting the birthday gifts.

dc63f96b-3d76-432f-a9b9-e4abde02693c-0
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.720
There seems to be quite a large
number of birthday gifts, and it

dc63f96b-3d76-432f-a9b9-e4abde02693c-1
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.338
looks as though there is a a
parent, maybe like a father and

dc63f96b-3d76-432f-a9b9-e4abde02693c-2
00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:43.549
a mother who is.

4a4775c0-0865-4f82-b766-557f5e2c0088-0
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.679
Giving a box to a girl, but you
can't see the girl's face, so I

4a4775c0-0865-4f82-b766-557f5e2c0088-1
00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.390
don't know if the girl is.

e32fccb5-138c-4de7-a4d1-d53b426c828b-0
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.444
The birthday girl or whether the
is it is it. She's been invited

e32fccb5-138c-4de7-a4d1-d53b426c828b-1
00:03:57.444 --> 00:04:03.565
to give the the gift to the the
girl. It's hard to tell who is

e32fccb5-138c-4de7-a4d1-d53b426c828b-2
00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:05.800
actually the the party.

a5b46b80-b67e-4e2f-a855-305ee9cd68a9-0
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.864
who the party is for I do see
another big cake that is is

a5b46b80-b67e-4e2f-a855-305ee9cd68a9-1
00:04:11.864 --> 00:04:16.985
being about to be placed onto
the big table by another person.

a5b46b80-b67e-4e2f-a855-305ee9cd68a9-2
00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:22.024
It looks as though 12347, the
birthday person, is going to be

a5b46b80-b67e-4e2f-a855-305ee9cd68a9-3
00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:23.000
7 years old.

48565bc4-4dbe-4307-9a18-f486d02b9258-0
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.016
There's some more people coming
and going from the entrance to

48565bc4-4dbe-4307-9a18-f486d02b9258-1
00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:30.510
the to the backyard.

4dbb1c47-a452-4b06-94cb-71c644c21bd2-0
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.200
And so it seems to be, for the
most part, slightly chaotic, but

4dbb1c47-a452-4b06-94cb-71c644c21bd2-1
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.040
managed well. At this point it
must have been.

be54d939-7bd0-477a-905d-6792f699864c-0
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.283
#END_birthday_party_fun It must
have been a a costume party

be54d939-7bd0-477a-905d-6792f699864c-1
00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:54.035
slash birthday party. But at
this point I still can't find

be54d939-7bd0-477a-905d-6792f699864c-2
00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:59.110
the person who's the birthday is
for. {All right good, so that

be54d939-7bd0-477a-905d-6792f699864c-3
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.346
was just over 4 minutes. We can
move on to the next item. Again,

be54d939-7bd0-477a-905d-6792f699864c-4
00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.360
this is a complex scene.}

a6040a1a-6bb7-4760-b7a2-22ba2c1435e1-0
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.930
{And you can start when you're
ready.}

3da0bb25-4215-4922-9b18-5cde1ffdaf11-0
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.730
#START_ancient_rome Ohh, this is
another.

8fa8111a-e1af-4723-aa5d-1ea28e9845b8-0
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.899
Two page, um, part of this book
that really depicts a lot of

8fa8111a-e1af-4723-aa5d-1ea28e9845b8-1
00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:25.581
people. I can't. I can't imagine
how many people there, there

8fa8111a-e1af-4723-aa5d-1ea28e9845b8-2
00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:31.354
there is at this point, but it
takes place. Looks like it's an

8fa8111a-e1af-4723-aa5d-1ea28e9845b8-3
00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:33.370
ancient Rome or Greek.

254ebfa4-c312-4e5c-8049-e6578344cb7f-0
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.940
Um.

46e71a1b-a8a1-4d49-870d-c7bafac494d2-0
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.220
Kind of like a a game fighting
scene that's taking place.

8e282588-149c-42bf-af25-28b723777eef-0
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.533
The actual it's it's taking
place in around Arena where

8e282588-149c-42bf-af25-28b723777eef-1
00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:51.840
there are spectators on one side
cheering on.

2da7b68c-5068-4724-beb2-429155eff4dc-0
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.471
I guess it is a fight between
men and animals. And on the

2da7b68c-5068-4724-beb2-429155eff4dc-1
00:05:58.471 --> 00:06:04.525
other scene, on the other side
of the arena, I do see a a a

2da7b68c-5068-4724-beb2-429155eff4dc-2
00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:10.881
royal couple who's sitting on
also observing, as well as a lot

2da7b68c-5068-4724-beb2-429155eff4dc-3
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:11.889
of guards.

00dc0585-52d3-4238-9b73-6fcff171aa42-0
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.850
And.

6686d47c-15ba-4e22-b95b-8bb82ec94603-0
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.885
I do see at one side that there
is a a group of lions that have

6686d47c-15ba-4e22-b95b-8bb82ec94603-1
00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:26.464
actually pyramided themselves,
123456788 lions that have

6686d47c-15ba-4e22-b95b-8bb82ec94603-2
00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:32.730
pyramided themselves enough so
that the lions are actually now.

e4358e5d-9cb4-46a9-86bd-c237f1a7604b-0
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.320
at the spectators.

dd37e672-401b-46b1-831f-00b9eecac255-0
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.598
seating area, which has caused a
bit of disruption on the lower

dd37e672-401b-46b1-831f-00b9eecac255-1
00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:44.560
on the upper left side of the
the page.

f91c706a-9c3c-4e4f-8094-d4931437eae8-0
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.804
Which is very interesting how
this has been done without the

f91c706a-9c3c-4e4f-8094-d4931437eae8-1
00:06:51.804 --> 00:06:57.613
lions being trained on the the
rest of the the the arena. Ohh

f91c706a-9c3c-4e4f-8094-d4931437eae8-2
00:06:57.613 --> 00:07:03.141
this, it says games in ancient
Rome. So this is this isn't

f91c706a-9c3c-4e4f-8094-d4931437eae8-3
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:09.137
depiction of what's happening in
ancient Rome. There's a lot of

f91c706a-9c3c-4e4f-8094-d4931437eae8-4
00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:15.226
animals I see, mostly lions but
also leopards or that are trying

f91c706a-9c3c-4e4f-8094-d4931437eae8-5
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.070
to fight.

991a54f9-3fa0-47f6-84cf-8a1b64dbadc7-0
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.900
Against.

aa9541a0-fc7c-49ca-802a-26dcbf86ecda-0
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:26.300
The men's men are carrying
swords and protectors.

8da61819-eedb-4d3f-82f6-ed3b3785b553-0
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.280
Since there are also some
fighting that are taking place

8da61819-eedb-4d3f-82f6-ed3b3785b553-1
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.100
between men.

7f6a8b6f-69ad-4382-802a-2eebd988cf85-0
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.336
With each other and not animals.
So there's a lot of activities

7f6a8b6f-69ad-4382-802a-2eebd988cf85-1
00:07:37.336 --> 00:07:38.420
that's going on and.

6d083ef2-84d1-4f6a-ac7e-ea2e7ef30fdf-0
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.429
But there's also to the middle
left side there's a group of

6d083ef2-84d1-4f6a-ac7e-ea2e7ef30fdf-1
00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:49.030
horses being dragged.

4c049c89-e2b2-41de-b303-aba1d377d935-0
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.240
Or is is it looks like it's like
a plow

702b1651-a19c-4bb1-bcd8-547925d81f0d-0
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.420
Plant.

b4daf956-9923-443a-85ed-c4e4caf0e88b-0
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:04.100
A horse that's pulling a person
who has just run over.

527b452d-3909-4c5f-bee1-64d295db9c16-0
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.306
Another person, and I don't know
if it's a race, oh, there is

527b452d-3909-4c5f-bee1-64d295db9c16-1
00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:13.792
another race. That's oh, there
is. There's actually now I see

527b452d-3909-4c5f-bee1-64d295db9c16-2
00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:18.279
there's a couple of races that
are taking place with a number

527b452d-3909-4c5f-bee1-64d295db9c16-3
00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:21.970
of of horses pulling a man,
although there is one.

2bc4f10f-0ace-4478-9b5b-4127b092415d-0
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.590
That shows the opposite of four
men pulling a horse.

582b9362-c8a1-43ba-ad5f-58fcd732cd93-0
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.946
Which is also, I guess it's
showing how fast they're running

582b9362-c8a1-43ba-ad5f-58fcd732cd93-1
00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:38.782
because there's there's like
123456 people who have been run

582b9362-c8a1-43ba-ad5f-58fcd732cd93-2
00:08:38.782 --> 00:08:43.777
over by this race that's taking
place kind of in the middle of

582b9362-c8a1-43ba-ad5f-58fcd732cd93-3
00:08:43.777 --> 00:08:48.535
of the arena with everything
else that's going on. So it is

582b9362-c8a1-43ba-ad5f-58fcd732cd93-4
00:08:48.535 --> 00:08:49.090
fairly.

1c0cb68c-4592-4702-994a-3f5935b34cad-0
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.840
A chaotic scene.

e54bc655-b3b0-43bd-857b-981d5c781a07-0
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.050
There's also.

7f511b7e-17cc-4606-b4b3-323162a26cdc-0
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.418
Another ladder that's going up
on the to the right corner of

7f511b7e-17cc-4606-b4b3-323162a26cdc-1
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:08.450
the page with 1234 people trying
to go up.

1de15b98-afde-40a4-a4ca-f121e5b07972-0
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:15.401
And also to the spectators
level, but is being suppressed.

1de15b98-afde-40a4-a4ca-f121e5b07972-1
00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:21.431
So in many ways the lion was
much more successful in getting

1de15b98-afde-40a4-a4ca-f121e5b07972-2
00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:27.560
to the spectators than the man
and the men for the most part.

e063ef50-18a2-4dd0-9cc1-c7a342071120-0
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.180
There are a number of.

f0e8c3b4-0b60-45b6-a16d-8b705494773e-0
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:41.387
What's interesting is that the
spectators to the bottom of the

f0e8c3b4-0b60-45b6-a16d-8b705494773e-1
00:09:41.387 --> 00:09:41.990
page.

02ae81b5-73e4-4a56-8a01-c4252cdf8723-0
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.097
They seem to be cheering. They
all seem to be mostly men. It's

02ae81b5-73e4-4a56-8a01-c4252cdf8723-1
00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:53.625
difficult to see because they're
not really showing their faces.

02ae81b5-73e4-4a56-8a01-c4252cdf8723-2
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:58.983
But I don't own maybe one or two
women, but for the most part,

02ae81b5-73e4-4a56-8a01-c4252cdf8723-3
00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:01.960
this is a male activity. The
only.

42ce4dc3-8ad9-40ea-8bf8-b903df900e48-0
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.471
The female that I see here is
the Princess, one of the the

42ce4dc3-8ad9-40ea-8bf8-b903df900e48-1
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:08.450
royal couple.

938d0591-3ede-4277-8ce4-a740c10bb08f-0
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.472
#END_ancient_rome Depicts
depicting how it was like in the

938d0591-3ede-4277-8ce4-a740c10bb08f-1
00:10:13.472 --> 00:10:14.930
ancient Roman times as well.

c5941855-79a1-40c0-9781-1e013ce6c9c1-0
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.360
{All right, that was about 5
minutes, OK.

cd980620-b819-4925-8bd9-34152cc8d9e6-0
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.080
OK, so.

0aa83ef9-9ae1-45cc-b670-ac7551ad2cbf-0
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.840
Now we're going into a different
type of pictures of the graphic

0aa83ef9-9ae1-45cc-b670-ac7551ad2cbf-1
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.020
novels. This one in particular
is about 6 pages, OK?}

fae03502-653f-4390-9e97-521f2bf631ad-0
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.330
{We're aiming for between 10 to
15 minutes, OK?}

a1813d87-7d92-4492-a1d4-5396d1e49f88-0
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.330


810f50c0-1d18-4e2a-8718-a13f0d98a53f-0
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:48.415
#START_arrival-6 This is a
series of of of illustrations

810f50c0-1d18-4e2a-8718-a13f0d98a53f-1
00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:49.460
that show.

bd125c91-ae4d-43cc-90ca-31507b98d6a2-0
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.840
Um.

d67a26c0-5dad-472c-8571-e288a97d0d60-0
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.090
I see a a pot. It starts from
left to right.

0bbb45b6-0538-4bc1-9896-7cf085c98a2f-0
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.520
And I see and it's in not black
and white, but in.

6ace70f5-295b-4770-9bbc-e26a79d6d14f-0
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.570
Light, silver or light.

9aa1a051-0799-4515-8996-7d672dee69ac-0
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.260
It's not. It's not in in a
colorful way, but it depicts.

1997e35d-a4e1-4770-9f99-d4ff61873944-0
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.974
The illustration is very warm in
the sense of how the color is

1997e35d-a4e1-4770-9f99-d4ff61873944-1
00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:18.280
used.

19c50269-3a46-4eba-b5db-58eb017f3b98-0
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:25.234
To it shows a a pot in one scene
and an animal flies over. An

19c50269-3a46-4eba-b5db-58eb017f3b98-1
00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:29.660
unusual looking animal flies
over to the pot.

2984fcf7-6907-490b-bba9-6019927f266a-0
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.120
To drop something into the pot.

9b7e4be0-91b8-40d0-8216-51c4a345bf50-0
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.380
The pot is now being shown.

59dd9882-d952-4d07-9fa7-5d9c360bbebf-0
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.040
With a man writing a letter.

7b6e03f0-ee14-4ed2-b3b8-59c185e65afa-0
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.055
And it looks as though it's at
the end, it's in the evening,

7b6e03f0-ee14-4ed2-b3b8-59c185e65afa-1
00:11:47.055 --> 00:11:52.689
he's writing a letter and he's
folding the letter in the shape

7b6e03f0-ee14-4ed2-b3b8-59c185e65afa-2
00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:58.233
of a a bird and he's now putting
it in an envelope with looks

7b6e03f0-ee14-4ed2-b3b8-59c185e65afa-3
00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:02.705
like they are tickets of maybe
for a rail pass or

7b6e03f0-ee14-4ed2-b3b8-59c185e65afa-4
00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:07.981
transportation. He licks the
envelope and places the stamp

7b6e03f0-ee14-4ed2-b3b8-59c185e65afa-5
00:12:07.981 --> 00:12:11.380
and is about to take the letter
down.

27d3a3d5-94ee-440b-8a06-1ef90ae3f19f-0
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:18.540
Outside with another animal that
is looking more like a fantasy.

2eedc2c4-4501-49ed-b5da-6a21330f9290-0
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.020


caecc4b1-ed67-41f6-a6f9-c2faacbbabdc-0
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:27.374
Unusual animal, he is then now
talking to somebody, a woman who

caecc4b1-ed67-41f6-a6f9-c2faacbbabdc-1
00:12:27.374 --> 00:12:30.840
is also carrying another
unusual.

fe2b54a5-32ec-4ced-b7b2-014945db1e84-0
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.870
Animal with a tail and a basket,
and she is actually pointing.

20628791-8b11-451e-9c77-6f400ca37fae-0
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.996
Maybe to help him direct where
the post box is, he gets to the

20628791-8b11-451e-9c77-6f400ca37fae-1
00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:47.060
post box, which is also a fairly
unusual looking post box.

0dc5b010-ee05-4eae-9df0-9f9c09e0a04f-0
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.430
And he's reading and then opens
the.

9729545c-5723-4176-88fe-f1e4be63ee9d-0
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.350
The post box with the puller.

34d0c3c2-1d2e-40cd-a731-cbbbfcf166c1-0
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.320
Drops off the envelope, then he
looks up.

9db4c091-9339-4548-b1f1-8a607c8431ae-0
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.520
And he sees that actually the
the post box is now sailed away.

79ade25f-3fd6-41c4-88ef-48f49f9df53d-0
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.380
because it is high up in 

cf43b7cd-4113-42f4-a1fc-8f1f86b1289c-0
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.250
the sky overlooking a valley as
as the man is walking away.

9239e5e2-b768-41a3-bb48-68b9f70cc070-0
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.550
Um.

45fa1a09-4efa-43a2-827c-d7c5a04fdb26-0
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:28.792
The first picture shows a leaf
that's standing in in the ground

45fa1a09-4efa-43a2-827c-d7c5a04fdb26-1
00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:31.460
and as the leaf gets water.

df4ab3b9-56f8-406a-bd55-cf7c880d28bc-0
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.540
It is actually growing, but it's
also splitting up into.

fdfa3dde-3241-4c63-a5b9-2a64de1204de-0
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.730
In it is is is forming from one
leaf to possibly 2 leaf.

64fa5d53-c4cd-43bb-a665-39ed70ad7057-0
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.940
But then it shows that it was
actually a flower, or a flower

64fa5d53-c4cd-43bb-a665-39ed70ad7057-1
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.000
of some kind of growth.

32b26a84-149b-44f7-9b6c-642f838463ba-0
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.189
Looks like a flower, and it's
actually gotten to be a bigger

32b26a84-149b-44f7-9b6c-642f838463ba-1
00:13:59.189 --> 00:14:02.040
flower that seems to illuminate
light.

cb3d09db-4ed5-400b-813f-cbc48d35c0de-0
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.730
And then?

7670039f-0db7-4890-a64d-87d43bd3ba78-0
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.290
At times it is not showing. It
is not illuminating, but.

ae1b75e5-5a50-44c5-a83d-3c4dcb4c7fcf-0
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.871
It looks as though there are
dragonfly like insects that are

ae1b75e5-5a50-44c5-a83d-3c4dcb4c7fcf-1
00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:19.790
flying around maybe.

da01bc13-f184-4b70-bf7b-d3d233225d7e-0
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:31.280
Planting eggs onto the flower.
The flower then is as a.

2f472ffe-6588-487b-91e3-e523ae0f53ca-0
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.430
Showing signs of where it looks
as though.

bd3496f5-d6c0-47f3-bc38-bcdeef5bfb4a-0
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.652
{Oh, I'm wondering whether I'm
I'm maybe going in a different

bd3496f5-d6c0-47f3-bc38-bcdeef5bfb4a-1
00:14:39.652 --> 00:14:42.330
sequence, because now I've
noticed that.}

8f18e249-fba3-4d4d-9281-7810a94a912e-0
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.026
{For this page, it looks as
though the pictures are all

8f18e249-fba3-4d4d-9281-7810a94a912e-1
00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:52.537
going in sequence from left to
right. I'm sorry I wasn't. I was

8f18e249-fba3-4d4d-9281-7810a94a912e-2
00:14:52.537 --> 00:14:56.907
going left one side going down,
} but it looks as though this

8f18e249-fba3-4d4d-9281-7810a94a912e-3
00:14:56.907 --> 00:15:00.290
page is showing four different
kinds of plants.

357722c5-133c-4431-858f-36346b31a017-0
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.448
That are showing ways in which
it's growing and also then

357722c5-133c-4431-858f-36346b31a017-1
00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:07.100
decaying.

4c1661f2-609a-4e54-9ee4-8f6b6cf91a17-0
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.353
One is a shape of a leaf that
looks as though it's about to

4c1661f2-609a-4e54-9ee4-8f6b6cf91a17-1
00:15:13.353 --> 00:15:16.760
become like a butterfly, but
then it becomes.

c7527f95-908d-4156-b9ad-481bd3589406-0
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.940
{No, I actually now see. OK.

ec8b85cc-84ad-4088-8938-2549403ade6c-0
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.978
It's a different sequence,
sorry.} It's changing. It's

ec8b85cc-84ad-4088-8938-2549403ade6c-1
00:15:24.978 --> 00:15:26.060
changing from.

a9e6e4d7-834c-4aac-9141-385aa59d29e5-0
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.795
It opens up almost like a
butterfly and it exposes like a

a9e6e4d7-834c-4aac-9141-385aa59d29e5-1
00:15:32.795 --> 00:15:37.911
flower. The flower is now
starting to drop the leaf, but

a9e6e4d7-834c-4aac-9141-385aa59d29e5-2
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:42.220
the flower part itself is is
beginning to grow.

6fe32eec-2382-4324-ad31-2fcfe7f78507-0
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.706
At the height of its growth, it
is illuminating light, and it's

6fe32eec-2382-4324-ad31-2fcfe7f78507-1
00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:49.460
also producing a lot of.

a569cf16-af38-4a98-81f4-c6080a64d982-0
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.400
Not petals, but.

d0e4ea30-db7a-4a96-ac46-e52d2e5157e0-0
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:59.697
Petal likes. I don't know if
it's producing seeds of that

d0e4ea30-db7a-4a96-ac46-e52d2e5157e0-1
00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:04.100
kind, but it is being whisked
away with the wind.

3dae6052-e1f6-42c8-910c-101ed436d927-0
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:10.285
And as the flower slowly changes
its shape, it becomes from

3dae6052-e1f6-42c8-910c-101ed436d927-1
00:16:10.285 --> 00:16:11.880
illuminated bright.

4618f070-91b6-4d26-8252-46068443f5b6-0
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.350
Just slowly showing.

f59ac646-b897-483c-be75-0ca859b03052-0
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.630
Signs that it's past its peak.

075275c3-5fd2-4a32-8ed8-ce4dc6a634d5-0
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.820
Now on the third column, 3rd row
of the of the pages.

5cf578d3-8d6d-4bd3-b85d-745191cc8784-0
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.810
There are insects like.

f79a0f76-cc60-4d35-ae79-a3ac8d3d1779-0
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.170
There are insects that are
coming to the flower.

6508d416-c324-4ace-a750-4faf90c53c62-0
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.620
And it is.

682f5f46-6604-4a62-bcfa-9b3256f676b0-0
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.150
It has created 123456 seeds, 6
big seeds almost like eggs.

5a2726ac-82e5-47e7-ae13-c7f7e22c5b28-0
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.979
And they have dropped onto the
floor onto the ground and are

5a2726ac-82e5-47e7-ae13-c7f7e22c5b28-1
00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:51.429
being taken by these insects
like creatures and it looks as

5a2726ac-82e5-47e7-ae13-c7f7e22c5b28-2
00:16:51.429 --> 00:16:55.970
though that seems to be the end
of the the Leafs.

bf74eb4f-9ad3-46a1-b9d1-acd6079a1d50-0
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.530
Life as once the eggs are
dropped.

e10b6292-d15c-4873-998d-d21904ca878c-0
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.645
There are several sequences of
pictures showing that the leaf

e10b6292-d15c-4873-998d-d21904ca878c-1
00:17:06.645 --> 00:17:08.610
is showing signs of decay.

e295dc98-a0cf-40fd-8295-4eb72e632aeb-0
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.300
It's it's turning from black.

ece58d70-ff00-45cc-ad6c-816d1ed4e851-0
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.486
To the black is slowly becoming
crumpled up and now looking

ece58d70-ff00-45cc-ad6c-816d1ed4e851-1
00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:17.950
like.

442ef94b-9e84-45f3-9fec-9d2f037b0672-0
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:24.308
Towards the end, it's no longer
looking like a black flower or a

442ef94b-9e84-45f3-9fec-9d2f037b0672-1
00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:27.230
black leaf, but more like A and
hold.

0e1a7976-cbdb-4127-9316-58ab18996884-0
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.490
Transparent.

a62463bb-9398-4626-97ae-9fdc96b9ffad-0
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.860
Shape.

12f4d6d9-e89b-4797-aefa-91d3d48bfcb0-0
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.750
It almost looks like a.

cc7c54f7-d307-44f4-9f98-90d2f6a3179a-0
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.913
Snowflake as I see that the
ground is beginning to be

cc7c54f7-d307-44f4-9f98-90d2f6a3179a-1
00:17:39.913 --> 00:17:41.980
covered with snow, OK.

b1f15c14-14fd-4213-9508-336a83cea4fd-0
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:54.760
This is an image of another
fantasy like picture of either a

b1f15c14-14fd-4213-9508-336a83cea4fd-1
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.810
factory.

9fbeb085-6cd9-4168-b520-b1d85d175185-0
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.880
It's in an urban setting.

faf9a3ab-7efe-464c-ab66-8fc7dfdc719c-0
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.350
I do see either people, but
they're very, very small.

8e6c5882-af07-4461-9db5-071cdbd2ce25-0
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.221
It is in the winter time, I
think, because there seems to be

8e6c5882-af07-4461-9db5-071cdbd2ce25-1
00:18:13.221 --> 00:18:13.720
things.

adfa6d50-6c4b-4357-9e27-48254084faca-0
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.870
That are covered in white.

d3ceb56a-5036-466d-a205-5011dc6c85d6-0
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.860
From there and not very many
trees.

a4fb50aa-a6f5-4eb1-b05c-f710de29231e-0
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.710
Umm.

cf3a4119-76c2-4ec6-836f-fc20340a58a2-0
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:31.010
And the main picture is focused
on the on a.

152d2cda-5609-4076-9b7f-c981a6ee91ed-0
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.430
A building structure.

b02d9398-cff5-4a3a-b807-29c1d0f46eb1-0
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.170
That kind of looks like a.

02e84a03-1ca2-4b23-98fb-08fd3a43e773-0
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:39.890
Umm.

d7cb0897-88ba-4656-a86a-ed95986dd621-0
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:45.212
That kind of looks like a
factory of some kind, because it

d7cb0897-88ba-4656-a86a-ed95986dd621-1
00:18:45.212 --> 00:18:46.780
has one two chimneys.

7ee4c36e-b7ad-4b2d-9ae2-86494252bcb4-0
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.860
Homes that are producing smoke.

4ff6546b-3c6a-40cc-b603-66afe4293d37-0
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.290
And on the top of the structure
is another.

79ec468e-4bee-4ca8-ab54-6ab515858fbf-0
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.150
Area where

847e4adb-e59b-4f76-bccc-594ade327204-0
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.640
People could either walk or.

18df44ee-4f32-411c-99ba-a71a443bce26-0
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.570
I guess in.

f1b74734-b260-4be9-b699-6c9ff0aff4b4-0
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:16.087
It could look like a an open
area where people can can walk.

f1b74734-b260-4be9-b699-6c9ff0aff4b4-1
00:19:16.087 --> 00:19:22.370
It shows how big it is because I
think to the lower left.

c3815634-b2ed-4411-8d97-639ee4824c20-0
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.470
There are.

efc21648-2dc6-41c7-b867-72e2e6bd183c-0
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:31.222
Signs that there might be
people, but that they're almost

efc21648-2dc6-41c7-b867-72e2e6bd183c-1
00:19:31.222 --> 00:19:37.748
like dots. So I think it's also
showing how big the structure is

efc21648-2dc6-41c7-b867-72e2e6bd183c-2
00:19:37.748 --> 00:19:40.660
actually is in proportion to.

597cbbb5-0740-4f7a-acf3-861860df24bb-0
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:48.360
There's another big structure to
the to the back of the the the

597cbbb5-0740-4f7a-acf3-861860df24bb-1
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.110
factory, but it's taller.

fee1060a-9abb-4bed-b9e5-a6e21d9df502-0
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:58.132
But it has very small windows in
proportion and also it also has

fee1060a-9abb-4bed-b9e5-a6e21d9df502-1
00:19:58.132 --> 00:20:00.140
some kind of a almost.

7eada87e-0c35-4a37-8c81-a7cb8c3837a3-0
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.430
Like a playground effect.

c22710ee-82bf-4ccc-a112-5d4cd89c8e11-0
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.920
On top of the roof.

9754b5d4-0db6-4c18-855e-3eaf88ec9db0-0
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.150
There seems to be another.

0a633ba9-1a2b-4f5b-923e-deaaa277f240-0
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:16.390
Like a tribal Native American
like tent.

97bec35c-c1a3-41ac-93d6-c0c0f405c006-0
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.880
Like structure to the right with
a big window, but a pointed

57cd5cc0-a38b-4b9b-8bc0-e02eb431f302-0
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.250
Roof.

6eda2cd0-b6ae-4d45-9ac9-e83214c99c2a-0
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.130
And then in the background there
seems to be other.

ea96e4ad-eeb8-4388-91fc-a7cce7ab44bb-0
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.320
Structures with tall chimneys.

d49ba57b-5b95-453a-a8f2-e636e1877b70-0
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.050


5fad63a0-cdc5-4e69-86d8-0e650438701e-0
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.040
And some flying objects they
look like.

48e303d1-901d-48ea-be8f-ed0b34ebc444-0
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.900
They look like ships, but um.

3b73ba30-ac2d-4db4-bf61-c828261e4b9e-0
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.306
They're shaped in the form of a
of ships, but there seems to be

3b73ba30-ac2d-4db4-bf61-c828261e4b9e-1
00:20:51.306 --> 00:20:53.300
a few of them flying around.

d21b6f97-a3a3-47b9-bd3b-11c1788b1666-0
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.040
OK.

b50be22b-95ed-4d5b-bdcc-197d35641a25-0
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.100
I think I now see OK, the.

bc5037b4-1d93-4ca3-a60a-6cd80db0d13b-0
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.590
This page starts off with the
the the jar where.

08e2f4e7-60e4-4a2b-bedb-8311ca94ff24-0
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.070
Um and.

402acf5f-f67c-478b-8e04-9c1037ceb0a7-0
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:25.393
Just a picture of the jar and
then the flying bird. An unusual

402acf5f-f67c-478b-8e04-9c1037ceb0a7-1
00:21:25.393 --> 00:21:28.290
looking bird is about to feed.

b71cb1d6-31d2-4b44-8377-8b12ec4554d5-0
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.790
Um 3.

780954ea-9a58-4730-b23f-695e34e35b42-0
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.800
Baby birds that are in the pot.

4d8c024b-aae7-4a8d-af29-c9cf0a8abc3d-0
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:44.261
Meanwhile, there's one big one
larger picture frame which shows

4d8c024b-aae7-4a8d-af29-c9cf0a8abc3d-1
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:50.020
on the pot in the background,
and a picture of a man sitting

4d8c024b-aae7-4a8d-af29-c9cf0a8abc3d-2
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.870
on a bed.

d334eae9-7ae6-4584-8a54-3b5286cd7f33-0
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.902
Looks like it's more like during
the day because there's light

d334eae9-7ae6-4584-8a54-3b5286cd7f33-1
00:21:55.902 --> 00:21:57.420
coming out from the window.

40a04578-d2d5-4114-ae3d-2adf89003ab1-0
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.470
Um, and he is sitting.

6671f2ae-bd7c-4517-b6a7-d0a9171e3cd4-0
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:07.754
On the bed facing the window,
but he holds a picture of his

6671f2ae-bd7c-4517-b6a7-d0a9171e3cd4-1
00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:12.250
family. I think the family is a
girl himself.

1e3ef97f-3976-428c-8dd6-94191362fea5-0
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:18.890
And his his partner there is a
an animal that.

e252bc02-d13b-418f-b5f8-262cf2f6eb6f-0
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.645
Also walk with him to the post
box that is also lying on this

e252bc02-d13b-418f-b5f8-262cf2f6eb6f-1
00:22:24.645 --> 00:22:24.970
bed.

35cb3bb6-74d1-41ce-8a20-87ca6d5f0588-0
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.850
And there's a few laundry.

d8d9382c-8761-4436-ad3f-b74334e332f3-0
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.080
Hanging from the.

cfaf27db-251e-49b7-85cf-8decd82c32f1-0
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.613
Uh against the wall would
suggest that he this is not a

cfaf27db-251e-49b7-85cf-8decd82c32f1-1
00:22:39.613 --> 00:22:44.312
hotel room. That is a room that
he lives and he's been living

cfaf27db-251e-49b7-85cf-8decd82c32f1-2
00:22:44.312 --> 00:22:48.783
there for, for a longer than a
hotel stay. That there is a

cfaf27db-251e-49b7-85cf-8decd82c32f1-3
00:22:48.783 --> 00:22:53.709
chair and a desk and a couple of
books that suggest that he is a

cfaf27db-251e-49b7-85cf-8decd82c32f1-4
00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:54.770
very studious.

f413c4ab-c441-4b35-8a49-00c82a4d55e8-0
00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.495
Or an academic oriented person.
The then the picture frame

f413c4ab-c441-4b35-8a49-00c82a4d55e8-1
00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:05.902
focuses on the animal that was
sleeping on the bed, but then he

f413c4ab-c441-4b35-8a49-00c82a4d55e8-2
00:23:05.902 --> 00:23:08.860
wakes up and he jumps off the
bed.

e8ba5932-1fa9-4d66-9fb9-9a178ef32599-0
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:16.578
The the man notices that the the
animal jumps off and as the

e8ba5932-1fa9-4d66-9fb9-9a178ef32599-1
00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:19.440
animal is going down a ladder.

7803c83e-e898-4d09-91a5-324b98c2d66a-0
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.130
To the lower level.

660bea35-44f7-403d-8c01-712436d11d76-0
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.540
He himself also.

53a40838-92f3-4dbc-ae16-241bfeaba16d-0
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.941
Goes down the ladder. The animal
finds a letter that was some

53a40838-92f3-4dbc-ae16-241bfeaba16d-1
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:36.330
placed in from out, which is on
the floor. The man picks up the

53a40838-92f3-4dbc-ae16-241bfeaba16d-2
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:36.920
letter.

3cb76101-5b2b-4a74-a87d-9f07c0f7441d-0
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:44.350
Um, he opens it up and he sees
that there is a a letter that

3cb76101-5b2b-4a74-a87d-9f07c0f7441d-1
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:51.170
has been folded in the shape of
a bird. He reads the the letter

3cb76101-5b2b-4a74-a87d-9f07c0f7441d-2
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.580
after he opens up the bird with.

fa8a0abf-5834-4e54-971e-11e975807646-0
00:23:55.410 --> 00:24:00.144
A look of a content and then
he's also looking outside the

fa8a0abf-5834-4e54-971e-11e975807646-1
00:24:00.144 --> 00:24:05.360
window with the with the letter
in his hand and he's looking up.

04fe8bbe-c67e-4ce0-bedb-024146e36b39-0
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.607
There's another picture of a
another origami like paper

04fe8bbe-c67e-4ce0-bedb-024146e36b39-1
00:24:14.607 --> 00:24:18.930
creature that's been made by
somebody.

3e858d77-5a76-4d37-a100-16dd07fe5eef-0
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.520
Um and.

8f511174-b50c-4950-8d74-bdb856a24c5e-0
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.640
I don't know what this is. Is
that an oven?

5b832f1a-a16f-462c-83d8-a06441bccdfe-0
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.670
Or a furnace.

8ef4407d-11bf-4195-8d97-aa549cac832f-0
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.831
Some kind of an unusual object
that I've never seen, but it

8ef4407d-11bf-4195-8d97-aa549cac832f-1
00:24:32.831 --> 00:24:35.430
looks like they had. It's had a
big hole.

32b8de59-1cea-4f16-8f21-53f804dd9670-0
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:42.607
And two dishes that are are are
visible, and it's a a pointed

32b8de59-1cea-4f16-8f21-53f804dd9670-1
00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:48.201
shape with that little chimney
to the side. Then there's a

32b8de59-1cea-4f16-8f21-53f804dd9670-2
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:51.140
picture of him in his hat and a

b4ad6647-1c42-4dad-85a1-58fa7dd006b4-0
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.500
A cloth that's hanging against
the wall of a hook.

e1700ea0-6861-453b-a4a7-9671e2223656-0
00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.680
And another image that is of a
bowl.

1125311c-f885-43c5-99b3-319559c4d332-0
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.220
either.

323103f6-0640-4201-a73e-984786bc0cb9-0
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.850
 kind of an unusual plant.

976e791c-b29e-4ff3-82ae-8083f2ff67ae-0
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:16.782
That looks like an artichoke,
but it could also look like a

976e791c-b29e-4ff3-82ae-8083f2ff67ae-1
00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:20.958
fish or a mouse. And then
there's a picture in the

976e791c-b29e-4ff3-82ae-8083f2ff67ae-2
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:24.070
background of an egg in a spoon
like.

f3bdb372-e929-4f85-88e8-75aa86a1f3ef-0
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:33.057
In this spoon near the bowl,
there's a more detailed picture

f3bdb372-e929-4f85-88e8-75aa86a1f3ef-1
00:25:33.057 --> 00:25:39.700
of a drawing. Looks like it was
being drawn by a child of.

ea29c16d-78a6-48cc-af7a-bb3557ccd162-0
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.297
Of a of a plane or a ship that's
acts as a plane and there's a

ea29c16d-78a6-48cc-af7a-bb3557ccd162-1
00:25:46.297 --> 00:25:47.630
person inside it.

9ea7d5e2-d53f-4432-8c5f-e2f14c675c32-0
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.260
I still can't figure out what
this is.

57fa1955-763e-4b95-818a-c4bced3aa7de-0
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.130
There's an unusual tool.

e729e678-c87c-476e-9eb1-6701f957cf5d-0
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.465
there is an image of an unusual
tool or a machine that I don't

e729e678-c87c-476e-9eb1-6701f957cf5d-1
00:26:03.465 --> 00:26:05.000
know how to describe.

b96d0f01-779e-4be1-b087-6c2d15eab764-0
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:10.509
Could it be like a coffee maker?
Maybe it's a coffee machine,

b96d0f01-779e-4be1-b087-6c2d15eab764-1
00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:15.169
because if the next picture is a
picture of an unusual coffee

b96d0f01-779e-4be1-b087-6c2d15eab764-2
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.470
cup.

2044436b-29b9-4f1a-9f2a-aa0c3411b533-0
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:23.603
And on top of either a newspaper
or a fabric with writing. And

2044436b-29b9-4f1a-9f2a-aa0c3411b533-1
00:26:23.603 --> 00:26:30.118
then the image is of his family
with the girl and his wife. The

2044436b-29b9-4f1a-9f2a-aa0c3411b533-2
00:26:30.118 --> 00:26:36.023
image that he was holding the
family portrait when he was

2044436b-29b9-4f1a-9f2a-aa0c3411b533-3
00:26:36.023 --> 00:26:42.334
sitting on the bed. And then
there's an image of a man giving

2044436b-29b9-4f1a-9f2a-aa0c3411b533-4
00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:44.880
either a woman or a girl.

e452b4c1-63f2-4ad9-8685-f91bc93f4e74-0
00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:51.878
A coin or a button, something
round, and he's about to place

e452b4c1-63f2-4ad9-8685-f91bc93f4e74-1
00:26:51.878 --> 00:26:53.420
it on her hand.

21c53849-f888-4d1d-8d7e-d77c557c359a-0
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.560
So it was a. The image is now
bigger.

c6378c87-3fa0-4c2c-bcb0-3b753331cdc5-0
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.696
With the man giving a either a
coin or something round to a

c6378c87-3fa0-4c2c-bcb0-3b753331cdc5-1
00:27:05.696 --> 00:27:06.660
little girl.

15f36e40-3866-4c6b-bbed-575824dc282a-0
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.681
And she's facing him and he has
three fingers pointed and

15f36e40-3866-4c6b-bbed-575824dc282a-1
00:27:11.681 --> 00:27:15.680
they're exchanged in a dialogue.
He looks happy. The mother is

15f36e40-3866-4c6b-bbed-575824dc282a-2
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.600
also sitting at the table and
they're having.

00c3ef63-5c78-4888-b895-9872c8a0a70b-0
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:25.787
Either a fruit or and coffee
that's being placed on the

00c3ef63-5c78-4888-b895-9872c8a0a70b-1
00:27:25.787 --> 00:27:30.450
table. The animal is by the
girl's foot.

044e9d50-3f42-49ec-9c68-cfc3528f7993-0
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.770
Is seeking attention from the
girl. It looks to be in a.

b503f947-f13b-40dd-9781-efc4c5fa59cf-0
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.411
In the kitchen dining room area,
there's pictures of of drawings

b503f947-f13b-40dd-9781-efc4c5fa59cf-1
00:27:44.411 --> 00:27:47.220
by the girl that's actually put
up.

faaeeaae-13e1-47f4-8b11-db2246c63643-0
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.650
On the wall against the wall.

4ba0a68b-ea36-4825-8796-c17c4b2f67d3-0
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.130
Um, the picture frame is also on
on the.

fa036453-c04a-4668-8caf-28bbbb70fde2-0
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.810
Is also placed.

be1c4385-708e-489b-97bf-928da137b880-0
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.910
On a shelving.

78883fc3-0cfd-467d-b3f6-e1372ccf9b0b-0
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:04.030
In this room along with the
folded origami.

39d6f801-b85d-4e92-8811-44cfd1bce592-0
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.230
Of a creature, so it looks as
though.

3a427c17-938f-49c9-a468-5c3d49d4be88-0
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.010
The picture that was drawn was
giving was sent.

5f9e184c-ceb6-47a9-9be9-d75d4c4f3d20-0
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.300
By the girl to the father.

52b5f450-b15f-43be-88c8-d66e900f8fd3-0
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.860
As well as the origami.

b0c16682-5709-4f4f-becc-cad7a7998aab-0
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.510
And the image of of the.

d22b6ddb-abe5-480d-adb0-ea696923719f-0
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.260
Of the.

cfb8db08-9048-4e6d-bb6d-656a967d132c-0
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.280
So there these are all of the
previous.

082d3490-8f2d-4437-bb2e-ed28845cb49f-0
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.358
Looks as though there were
memories of him as he was going

082d3490-8f2d-4437-bb2e-ed28845cb49f-1
00:28:35.358 --> 00:28:40.034
through his house and the room
that he liked to be with his

082d3490-8f2d-4437-bb2e-ed28845cb49f-2
00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:43.619
family. The girl is now putting
on her boots.

e1c90094-3c84-4636-a404-46f8f32b819f-0
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:50.884
And the animal has given her a
hat so that she can place it on

e1c90094-3c84-4636-a404-46f8f32b819f-1
00:28:50.884 --> 00:28:53.160
her head. She is running.

e78e4c14-0dc9-4577-91cc-e17c70f70b5d-0
00:28:54.550 --> 00:29:01.990
Outside and down the stairs with
the animal and they stop.

05e53390-45bd-4f20-9c26-37e4dfb88a7d-0
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:08.210
She points to either a flower or
some kind of a.

02bf5431-dce3-4708-b7c1-055c92fea8d4-0
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.480
A button as the animal looks on
and then.

531cf3f0-6ecd-45af-afb4-435c35e46175-0
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.523
#END_arrival-6 She's holding
something that is illuminating

531cf3f0-6ecd-45af-afb4-435c35e46175-1
00:29:16.523 --> 00:29:17.190
in the light.

67e0418c-f5cb-469e-84c4-c83d0a2057f0-0
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.330
{All right. So that's this part
of the story.}

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.240
{And now for the next item. It
is a complex scene.}

54c32170-a363-4f24-a99f-efaf5ad68ef9-0
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.280
{ok}

1ad48eef-57cf-4444-a2e6-551e2199a490-0
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.800
#START_waldo-1 Um, so another
picture from the Waldo series.

23f2e9cf-a59f-4e2a-b1bd-a95bdc277689-0
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.300
I guess you're supposed to find
Waldo in a picture that.

a1fdea47-db15-488a-8f26-e12635fc7dfc-0
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:49.820
Looks to be like a urban Town
Center.

f934f987-9844-4265-85e6-71f921a6a93f-0
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.590
Right in the middle of the town
is a fountain.

5e356003-e57a-467c-8cde-2c8f7a62f6ab-0
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.873
Uh, I would say it's a town
square. There's a fountain and

5e356003-e57a-467c-8cde-2c8f7a62f6ab-1
00:29:59.873 --> 00:30:04.364
people are walking, as well as a
couple of cars are going in

5e356003-e57a-467c-8cde-2c8f7a62f6ab-2
00:30:04.364 --> 00:30:05.910
different directions.

87cb6fbc-e924-4883-b5c5-9a974c081b58-0
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.360
Umm.

879b5756-e90d-4efc-81bb-4fd56643d803-0
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.550
There seems to be.

849e189b-2f0f-42e5-8d3a-f4249c6b61c7-0
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:18.250
A mixture of people walking,
running on scooters, on bikes.

ead5543d-6b90-4cac-acfa-87da7e7f361d-0
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:19.750
Umm.

139aaacf-e896-419e-95b2-fb80a537e284-0
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.326
To the lower bottom of the page
there seems to be a market open

139aaacf-e896-419e-95b2-fb80a537e284-1
00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:29.940
air, open air market that's
taking place.

09f659e6-ce65-440a-86c1-9e03fdf5de6b-0
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.230
Either selling flowers or
selling.

0e5ba586-d307-49ca-b795-94d28909023e-0
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:35.980
Umm.

01499022-8ab4-48bc-9746-427023691483-0
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:42.062
Hard to tell what that is, but
there's a couple of outdoor

01499022-8ab4-48bc-9746-427023691483-1
00:30:42.062 --> 00:30:47.160
vendor vendors and people are
wandering as well as looking.

9131cf6e-3ecd-46dc-9e70-405449c22d70-0
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.450
There are a number of cars on
the picture. There's actually

9131cf6e-3ecd-46dc-9e70-405449c22d70-1
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:59.940
one accident that has taken
place in the center of of the of

9131cf6e-3ecd-46dc-9e70-405449c22d70-2
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.730
the page, near the town square.

2f639937-abe9-4e18-8dda-d911bf1dd6eb-0
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.142
The town square is humorous in
the sense that there is a a

2f639937-abe9-4e18-8dda-d911bf1dd6eb-1
00:31:09.142 --> 00:31:14.322
person in on top of the fountain
dressed as though he's about to

2f639937-abe9-4e18-8dda-d911bf1dd6eb-2
00:31:14.322 --> 00:31:17.590
go scuba diving and people are
watching.

5f4efaf8-35be-4c2d-858e-4c4679662797-0
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.960
And uh.

9881972e-e430-4b75-8e89-2c5a746422b5-0
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.533
There also seems to be some
workers that are working

9881972e-e430-4b75-8e89-2c5a746422b5-1
00:31:27.533 --> 00:31:29.100
cleaning the windows.

80b584b7-ab8e-43c9-b87f-b6d40403f94a-0
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:34.998
But he seems is has dropped his
tool and it's about to land on

80b584b7-ab8e-43c9-b87f-b6d40403f94a-1
00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:37.140
somebody who is below him.

4fa81506-6b57-47f8-b124-f01e550eebdf-0
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.480
There's also another worker.

bb3cfc71-4e9d-4547-a86a-cc16dd174b87-0
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.400
Group. They're supposed to be
mopping.

1592339a-b4f2-4655-9aae-fb961d3a20ae-0
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.120
But instead on the rooftop.

001add45-8e90-4591-9f5e-e43bcee27bc0-0
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.600
They are pretending like they're
playing battlefield or or joking

001add45-8e90-4591-9f5e-e43bcee27bc0-1
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.479
around while one person is
actually just sitting and

001add45-8e90-4591-9f5e-e43bcee27bc0-2
00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:01.723
feeding the birds. So they're
supposed to be working, but

001add45-8e90-4591-9f5e-e43bcee27bc0-3
00:32:01.723 --> 00:32:06.261
they're not. There's another
group of workers on another part

001add45-8e90-4591-9f5e-e43bcee27bc0-4
00:32:06.261 --> 00:32:10.579
of the roof to the to the right
hand side. I think they're

001add45-8e90-4591-9f5e-e43bcee27bc0-5
00:32:10.579 --> 00:32:13.580
supposed to be checking the
electricity.

bc1b3072-d425-4f2f-bfbd-a2d708d185af-0
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:15.240
Umm.

c258dd5f-5ef2-4e3a-9934-8ae5f3edbf91-0
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:20.240
And that's on the rooftop. There
are also people who are.

066b5c23-7ddb-489a-a36f-7578cd63f129-0
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.730
Walking as well as showing
their.

adb63520-0657-4fce-b0b8-f7271a3ecff0-0
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.989
Faces through the windows of the
building. One person is watering

adb63520-0657-4fce-b0b8-f7271a3ecff0-1
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:30.280
the.

401a9203-8d64-4f4e-8b37-f4f753dca833-0
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.280
Watering the plant.

6446f263-4d02-450b-ba71-f529f4828d28-0
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.470
Another person is just saying
hello to people.

6b2bd1f4-9f8a-421b-99d5-d13866550b46-0
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.100


6377ca24-b239-4376-9721-1e61b5922686-0
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.870
One person is, I think, sitting
on the windowsill

d159d522-d572-4f8b-b394-f552bd4dfb29-0
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.300
Either with a fan.

9bfbd4f8-7478-4f1a-ae78-42e13acca8c5-0
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:53.066
Or watching TV, it's hard to
tell. There's another accident

9bfbd4f8-7478-4f1a-ae78-42e13acca8c5-1
00:32:53.066 --> 00:32:57.982
that's taking place at the top
corner of the page between 2

9bfbd4f8-7478-4f1a-ae78-42e13acca8c5-2
00:32:57.982 --> 00:33:03.309
cyclists, and it looks as though
it just happened because people

9bfbd4f8-7478-4f1a-ae78-42e13acca8c5-3
00:33:03.309 --> 00:33:07.570
are running to help them and
there's also a school.

e816480b-334e-4b19-8c5b-42d203ec46c4-0
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.930
Near that accident, because the
children must have.

bd0a16f7-b817-47c7-b798-0d13d60c8ead-0
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.730
About to.

d120294c-a058-4f78-adea-6270e9e423e5-0
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.440
Go to school or come.

4230bd13-d630-4794-80a4-bf4994b8348d-0
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.892
Leave the school, but there's a
lot of children going in and out

4230bd13-d630-4794-80a4-bf4994b8348d-1
00:33:23.892 --> 00:33:28.210
of the building as the principal
or the teacher says greets them.

6ae0d906-a605-4f83-b56e-10e0248bc748-0
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.100
Hello there is a.

ddb8ed2d-d49a-49f8-9bfc-025ac6ede623-0
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.940
There's another scene on the
roof where.

df5be9ba-a216-4edf-915a-82831f5db478-0
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.412
Two people are trying to rescue
a dog that seemed to have landed

df5be9ba-a216-4edf-915a-82831f5db478-1
00:33:44.412 --> 00:33:46.190
on the roof by accident.

f9045f38-9901-4440-9cf4-066bda2e1729-0
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:51.321
#END_waldo-1 They're trying to
grab the dog's leash so that

f9045f38-9901-4440-9cf4-066bda2e1729-1
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:55.379
they can rescue the dog. So
there's a lot of activity that's

f9045f38-9901-4440-9cf4-066bda2e1729-2
00:33:55.379 --> 00:33:58.838
taking place both on the
rooftops as well as on the

f9045f38-9901-4440-9cf4-066bda2e1729-3
00:33:58.838 --> 00:34:01.500
ground, as well as through the
windows.

787d0651-d989-42b8-83e8-07f3a39aaac6-0
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.510
{OK.

94310a74-a007-48cf-9d4d-07d8939f62ff-0
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.310
How long was that it was about?

0580859f-a7b8-4aa8-92bf-65c6b60093eb-0
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:17.090
5 minutes. OK, alright, so let's
take a break.}

bca5a5c0-fc40-4d7b-ab35-173895343b9f-0
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:26.513

pages.

bfbf5cb6-542c-4315-870e-21070c3f4a1e-0
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.050
For between 10 and 15 minutes to
tell the story.}

53959b6e-ce19-435d-8268-b81e9e99e4ab-0
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.880
{Umm.}

1a62c8ec-f4a8-449b-b03e-ed12824b12e3-0

ee719ae1-9adb-4f68-8303-66efbeed69f7-0
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.560
A location seems to be sometimes
somewhere in the park.

2ba64a1a-045e-456d-bb6a-a51122d91806-0
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:55.827
Um, there are two characters,
and the and the and the and the

2ba64a1a-045e-456d-bb6a-a51122d91806-1
00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:58.080
page looks like a boy.

21f89aa9-7b1e-42e7-83a7-5592006b65e2-0
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.490
Two boys or a boy and a girl?
Hard to tell.

373de958-c8dc-4018-b894-d1ae45a3b105-0
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.480
It is mostly in color.

ab346e11-dac5-4a91-84a6-0d873fd74b1a-0
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.440
It looks as though it's raining.

c7afb6fa-3833-4778-8ec7-fa98ccd1a7fd-0
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.972
And there is a little bit of
illumination that's taking place

c7afb6fa-3833-4778-8ec7-fa98ccd1a7fd-1
00:35:14.972 --> 00:35:15.540
as the boys.

45929d20-b43a-4e2d-80c7-de1f758e1d2d-0
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.640
To to.

23553736-1719-4436-9f07-9b8204e5032f-0
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:25.982
Children are under a bridge and
they're staying outside of the

23553736-1719-4436-9f07-9b8204e5032f-1
00:35:25.982 --> 00:35:26.510
rain.

197eb883-5615-4ad5-b35d-f493076b73cf-0
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.250
The bridge seems to be located
at a park.

f331a205-0237-49aa-a3c8-564ca712198c-0
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.390
Because there are two park
benches.

09149723-a4e9-43b3-9ce6-7ee9ece3d1e5-0
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:42.796
They are close to a lamp pole
and they seem to have arrived at

09149723-a4e9-43b3-9ce6-7ee9ece3d1e5-1
00:35:42.796 --> 00:35:48.496
this location by bike to two
person bike and looks as though

09149723-a4e9-43b3-9ce6-7ee9ece3d1e5-2
00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:54.662
they're just trying to stay away
from the rain. There seems to be

09149723-a4e9-43b3-9ce6-7ee9ece3d1e5-3
00:35:54.662 --> 00:35:58.120
a bird, a purple bird on one of
the.

Boys shoulder.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:04.730
Umm.

09cafd4c-9713-4b0a-a826-1e78e75a1b5d-0
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.420
All of a sudden, the door.

1c8166e5-7302-455d-8899-847e1bc6b2d0-0
00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.425
To under the bridge that they
were staying underneath the

1c8166e5-7302-455d-8899-847e1bc6b2d0-1

bridge has.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.360
Um quickly opened.

77862d39-4ee1-4685-80e5-24822b78ccc0-0
00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:19.930
Because.

4439a606-63d4-4df2-beb8-5cd58f25905c-0
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.120
It looks as though they were
almost pushed open by the door.

8d05b769-c973-47cd-9586-1c9944073f2e-0
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.370
There is a person that's come
out from the door.

65aab0f4-ce08-4ac1-af46-dea3593951db-0
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:38.530
A man with a an orange costume
and a beard and wearing a crown.

ff0432a1-4e2a-47aa-8744-380decc24ce1-0
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:44.710
Um, he's showing the two boys a
picture.

251e769f-00f7-4781-bd31-9345b4bc7896-0
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.310
A map of some sort, but is also
telling them to be quiet.

59ca65d6-98c0-4e81-8c03-040f01cdb745-0
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:57.035
The bird is also kind of scared
off when they the person

59ca65d6-98c0-4e81-8c03-040f01cdb745-1
00:36:57.035 --> 00:37:03.155
abruptly opened the door because
he is flying off the the child's

59ca65d6-98c0-4e81-8c03-040f01cdb745-2
00:37:03.155 --> 00:37:03.990
shoulder.

f3842644-2dab-4198-9fb5-02b2f426534c-0
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.430
Um, the man is pointing to the
map.

d5aa5002-356a-4bc7-9c35-a9190b9d5f8d-0
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.694
And giving the two boys
instructions and then all of a

d5aa5002-356a-4bc7-9c35-a9190b9d5f8d-1
00:37:14.694 --> 00:37:18.090
sudden there are two armed men
who pulls

cce52390-5c5f-42a3-a74f-a8eaf98157ac-0
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:25.488
The man away from the boys and
telling him to come back into a

cce52390-5c5f-42a3-a74f-a8eaf98157ac-1
00:37:25.488 --> 00:37:26.230
a room.

b1f64dd7-b590-4505-a179-a98025e34a05-0
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:35.201
He in the means, in the midst of
of being pulled away, drops a an

b1f64dd7-b590-4505-a179-a98025e34a05-1
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:37.990
orange tube on the floor.

72820feb-1471-455b-9b24-3cfb6027e0cb-0
00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.030
And is being pulled away and
taken back into the room.

5eaa6f02-b86c-4ba7-8f37-9e03f3dddde9-0
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.690
The room door has closed.

3da300e2-3e67-4f49-be5c-6e323c18f529-0
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.440
The boys are now.

57c0dd92-8c54-4c93-a5f0-6d63ea23dc26-0
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.600
Looking at having the orange
tube.

715825cc-6eaa-4c6e-b333-d9dc89ef79b7-0
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:03.120
Ah, it looks as though they seem
to fit.

1cb2e0d8-ac44-4270-8f8c-e17140636926-0
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.730
Umm.

9531bdb5-8fc5-440c-b33e-6026f7173fff-0
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.550
There are keys.

3d5bc479-06c0-4786-a96c-4c6800218307-0
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.170
Umm.

cd845e49-35f3-4fa6-93f4-07967c4295ec-0
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:14.945
That have that will allow them,
the boys, to open the door and

cd845e49-35f3-4fa6-93f4-07967c4295ec-1
00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:20.659
then once the keys have opened
the door they rush in with the

cd845e49-35f3-4fa6-93f4-07967c4295ec-2
00:38:20.659 --> 00:38:21.120
bird.

7d41713c-e407-4636-878f-2ec7d2195aa6-0
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:29.079
They get to a point that the
scene of the the the page is the

7d41713c-e407-4636-878f-2ec7d2195aa6-1
00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:33.460
two boys have have arrived at a
very different scene.

ecf18067-3edf-4adf-860a-3e9070ce4253-0
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.190
They seem to have come in from
under a tunnel cave.

bf564d46-3f19-4622-9a35-bd215432e171-0
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.280
And are looking from afar.

3c375e06-986b-4afc-b835-480f5be4ba51-0
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:50.931
At the old man in dressed in
orange, who is at the base of a

3c375e06-986b-4afc-b835-480f5be4ba51-1
00:38:50.931 --> 00:38:51.510
large.

ce75583a-3572-4c08-a709-bed67d62a27c-0
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.440
castle or at the start of a.

3c31188c-25a0-4e9d-838f-2abe139df892-0
00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.523
Oh no, it's actually a boat. OK,
got it. The boat is sailing

3c31188c-25a0-4e9d-838f-2abe139df892-1
00:39:03.523 --> 00:39:03.950
away.

8ad528db-c467-47e5-96da-b0bbc618c453-0
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:11.057
And the man is being held
hostage by the two army men.

8ad528db-c467-47e5-96da-b0bbc618c453-1
00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:14.180
They're dressed in medieval
times.

e4dfbc30-7e4a-494b-b22c-f05fb1538fb9-0
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:19.181
The people who are on the boat
as well as the army and they're

e4dfbc30-7e4a-494b-b22c-f05fb1538fb9-1
00:39:19.181 --> 00:39:20.350
about to be whisked.

7f676048-b7e2-4995-8727-daedba68aa0f-0
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.530
Driving away from the two boys
that are looking.

cd725033-05a6-4cff-89f6-84bbb8aa803a-0
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.150
At the scene, but from afar
away.

32ef1806-3066-4147-bcaa-209dbcd49011-0
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:35.900
They are looking at a there's a
river that's in between them.

d8869fb0-340d-4ab0-ad23-882b9551151a-0
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:41.823
And it looks as though it's a
medieval town, an entry to a

d8869fb0-340d-4ab0-ad23-882b9551151a-1
00:39:41.823 --> 00:39:42.260
town.

71cf6620-c8e6-464d-b3bb-a5883d2ae771-0
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.679
There are also some flying
objects onto the sky, as well as

71cf6620-c8e6-464d-b3bb-a5883d2ae771-1
00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:53.880
some chaos that's taking place
because one of the towers.

326e5053-0d34-4dba-a9d2-4492d21cf5fd-0
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:58.904
Of the town is actually burning,
there's another fire that's

326e5053-0d34-4dba-a9d2-4492d21cf5fd-1
00:39:58.904 --> 00:40:02.805
actually taking place at the
base of the tower as well. So

326e5053-0d34-4dba-a9d2-4492d21cf5fd-2
00:40:02.805 --> 00:40:06.509
there's a little bit of
corruption or disruption that's

326e5053-0d34-4dba-a9d2-4492d21cf5fd-3
00:40:06.509 --> 00:40:08.890
taking place at this medieval
town.

617c2f81-2136-4a61-b1e6-11245c54e195-0
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.900
The boy's, meanwhile, are still
hiding.

2ca10135-8e28-471b-911d-4f365e1c2364-0
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.724
But they are now looking at this
map that the old man had given

2ca10135-8e28-471b-911d-4f365e1c2364-1
00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:23.770
to the boy.

e17f7808-da35-443c-8f26-da6941e2da82-0
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.730
And the map shows.

aa5275f8-76a7-47d5-b7b8-1cd5f1b5473c-0
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.070
12346 circles.

8c1a80fe-15f3-4714-aeba-10a8c84b333f-0
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.830
Um.

986bb154-bac2-410f-93e0-db268e1f655a-0
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:39.311
I think there are locations of
this medieval city that they

986bb154-bac2-410f-93e0-db268e1f655a-1
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:40.730
have arrived at.

5ef804aa-234d-437e-bf80-25811d48a292-0
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.190
Umm.

d46c9b76-d1a5-4d7f-989b-2627355b2342-0
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.058
It seems like people are
escaping and leaving this

d46c9b76-d1a5-4d7f-989b-2627355b2342-1
00:40:47.058 --> 00:40:51.887
medieval town because there are
three, at least three fires that

d46c9b76-d1a5-4d7f-989b-2627355b2342-2
00:40:51.887 --> 00:40:56.716
are taking place. So don't know
if it's like a war that's taking

d46c9b76-d1a5-4d7f-989b-2627355b2342-3
00:40:56.716 --> 00:40:59.539
place or there's chaos or
corruption.

0beb94f2-c0bd-47e0-b77a-b98af3f2088e-0
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.580
And the the image of the map
shows that the boy.

dd0b39c7-0ae1-401b-8910-9c6f6ddd418e-0
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.797
The boy needs to. The boys are
pointing that they need to get

dd0b39c7-0ae1-401b-8910-9c6f6ddd418e-1
00:41:11.797 --> 00:41:16.537
to the first location, which
seems to be underground because

dd0b39c7-0ae1-401b-8910-9c6f6ddd418e-2
00:41:16.537 --> 00:41:20.190
there are fish and it's
highlighted in yellow.

ca4cbf2a-0c0b-4eb8-bd05-252073be9d34-0
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:30.630
The boys are waiting until the
medieval soldiers.

fe7e3187-6e08-47ae-91e6-4463846e97ff-0
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.160
Uh have have.

d5a1055d-9f2f-4e85-8ed2-1f05e239b52f-0
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.908
They look, they seem to be
looking for somebody, and so

d5a1055d-9f2f-4e85-8ed2-1f05e239b52f-1
00:41:39.908 --> 00:41:45.077
they're waiting until they find
an opportunity. They're still

d5a1055d-9f2f-4e85-8ed2-1f05e239b52f-2
00:41:45.077 --> 00:41:49.329
hiding behind the rock along the
river. They both.

670592e3-f429-41cc-9e03-73c462ec155f-0
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.420
Are now.

8d52614f-b0c6-4b0d-8d51-6c5848e554eb-0
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.130
About to get into the water.

1583da96-8b69-423b-8ccc-a812fcb96860-0
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.610
Meanwhile, they be. They have
been.

49cfef6f-9c49-49eb-aa38-d35b27f94eec-0
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.140
They're about to get into the
water because one of the boys.

8aef9c76-a2d9-4f6c-ac73-2c94f86a9bde-0
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.890
Now have.

9c85fcc1-12bf-44c4-bae0-46290d834551-0
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:08.580
Umm.

dd5d4a06-713a-4a9e-b27f-75c9265cb89e-0
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.980
Of the flippers for the water.

27349d45-08d6-4ddc-baa3-bebe047a0c4b-0
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.050
And this second boy seems to be
holding on to.

61ce2f96-3194-4f66-8098-30d1742dfc4f-0
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.510
An octopus, leg of an octopus.

e6daee5d-6427-408e-b0fa-ef26921fe710-0
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.340
And they dive into the river.

6246f11e-0e68-45f4-89d4-e22a2966feca-0
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:34.912
Ohh I see. OK, so somehow they
are now able to draw items that

6246f11e-0e68-45f4-89d4-e22a2966feca-1
00:42:34.912 --> 00:42:40.530
they need and are able to obtain
it. So they were able to obtain.

af08b070-8c8c-4e6d-b520-69dee2331348-0
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.123
Oxygen masks as well as flippers
so that they could go

af08b070-8c8c-4e6d-b520-69dee2331348-1
00:42:47.123 --> 00:42:52.407
underground. Even the the bird
now has an oxygen mask and a

af08b070-8c8c-4e6d-b520-69dee2331348-2
00:42:52.407 --> 00:42:57.251
tank and they are both being
guided by this very large

af08b070-8c8c-4e6d-b520-69dee2331348-3
00:42:57.251 --> 00:43:02.887
octopus purple octopus creature
who is heading down towards the

af08b070-8c8c-4e6d-b520-69dee2331348-4
00:43:02.887 --> 00:43:08.435
side of the the first map point
that they have to go to, which

af08b070-8c8c-4e6d-b520-69dee2331348-5
00:43:08.435 --> 00:43:08.700
is.

bf044a90-037c-46a5-869f-0d7172d6fbef-0
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.030
Um a

ac13b090-b4fb-4739-973e-35f615692ebf-0
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.760
A city that was buried under the
water.

dd50c682-1c72-4add-ad9e-15d37580a91a-0
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.491
But it seems to be showing some
light and they're they're

dd50c682-1c72-4add-ad9e-15d37580a91a-1
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:21.960
swimming towards that
destination.

59718e3f-45e6-49a5-8864-1a34bd88e553-0
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.130
Umm.

24d82f8d-44f5-47b4-a5c2-bd28904f1c45-0
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.650
Let's see.

031fc345-8612-41ee-9785-25789639766f-0
00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.350
When they get to, uh this

6673e682-af39-4a2d-a318-92fa35bac37e-0
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.760
Ancient underground.

4e25b201-a938-45c4-945c-34dd1c8e2b4b-0
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.000
Uh, remains, they find.

68c46ae9-bbb8-4027-aa4b-acb74a21c153-0
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.658
This is if they find another
item that could potentially be a

68c46ae9-bbb8-4027-aa4b-acb74a21c153-1
00:43:43.658 --> 00:43:45.200
key and one of the.

e235bea8-a645-4f3e-a8ac-3995ddc68533-0
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:53.510
Underground underwater statues
that are that has since.

1f4626bb-0afe-4b21-be77-4341f212e0ec-0
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:54.980
Umm.

025c655e-1d40-44a2-be21-ba0fd188f4a7-0
00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:01.233
Probably been shown on the map
they seem to have located.

025c655e-1d40-44a2-be21-ba0fd188f4a7-1
00:44:01.233 --> 00:44:06.324
Meanwhile, they have been found
underwater by the soldiers. The

025c655e-1d40-44a2-be21-ba0fd188f4a7-2
00:44:06.324 --> 00:44:07.040
soldiers.

3b5d67d1-c4c3-4240-a5bb-ba022cdca0b5-0
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.400
I think that the the head of
this soldier might be the person

3b5d67d1-c4c3-4240-a5bb-ba022cdca0b5-1
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.670
that's a leader because he's
wearing a gold outfit and he is

3b5d67d1-c4c3-4240-a5bb-ba022cdca0b5-2
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:21.010
telling his soldiers to follow
the two boys who are now being

3b5d67d1-c4c3-4240-a5bb-ba022cdca0b5-3
00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:21.710
pulled up.

56ad7c55-52f4-40c9-8ae9-3eae139c58fe-0
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:26.560
By the large purple octopus to
get to the next destination.

f25db009-6570-44d1-977b-235ca7e2d9e8-0
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.160
Um, the boys have arrived.

2f2510d7-398a-4886-86a4-16ce1f73f453-0
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:40.020
At a an island that looks more
tropical, there are about to

2f2510d7-398a-4886-86a4-16ce1f73f453-1
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:45.480
take off. One has taken off his
oxygen tank and his.

f2e2f384-aeff-4097-94cb-5ef05af517cc-0
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.910
Uh is now running up the hill
with his shoes and.

6384d348-9f53-4a7b-bb85-ff8371e585b4-0
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.500
Looks as though these are the
items that they hold.

fcb16fdb-6363-4ee3-85f0-9caf90a7d704-0
00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:02.305
Are large crayons that they can
draw so that they can obtain the

fcb16fdb-6363-4ee3-85f0-9caf90a7d704-1
00:45:02.305 --> 00:45:04.280
things that they need. So.

e36b7d40-1053-44d3-a9cb-ee294ca9bdff-0
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.185
Like the shoes and the flippers,
I think they drew them back, the

e36b7d40-1053-44d3-a9cb-ee294ca9bdff-1
00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:14.171
shoes that he has drawn them
back so that he can have shoes

e36b7d40-1053-44d3-a9cb-ee294ca9bdff-2
00:45:14.171 --> 00:45:14.570
again.

820d4f61-eb8b-4ef8-94f9-ea20b2e82b22-0
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.216
And the second picture to the
right shows that the boys are

820d4f61-eb8b-4ef8-94f9-ea20b2e82b22-1
00:45:22.216 --> 00:45:27.740
about to draw the next item that
they need for their.

f12e21f2-cf75-4e9f-bddd-80cecaa67255-0
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:34.346
In their in search for their
item that they need to need to

f12e21f2-cf75-4e9f-bddd-80cecaa67255-1
00:45:34.346 --> 00:45:34.690
find.

4f077ddf-b13c-4de4-a8a2-029feb5633d6-0
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:44.223
Oh, so they drew a a rhinoceros
that is going to be used that is

4f077ddf-b13c-4de4-a8a2-029feb5633d6-1
00:45:44.223 --> 00:45:50.480
used as a traveling
transportation. The two boys are

4f077ddf-b13c-4de4-a8a2-029feb5633d6-2
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.139
sitting on a purple rhinoceros.

9f1cab93-ee91-4cc4-9b27-08006e318e04-0
00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.820
And is heading into another town
that is.

e5363fb2-5556-4eb5-8d9c-72b13e98bba3-0
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.160
Almost like another.

1ebd10bf-5358-4f4c-9e85-70f8d45b6ca4-0
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:05.870
Medieval.

7ab630a8-4301-4bbf-b66e-84349a14d34a-0
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:12.350
Ohh town but is full of of
trees. It looks tropical.

6aa205f9-a443-416d-afd4-475399f2a739-0
00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:19.239
Now and that they are on a road
heading into the gates of a of

6aa205f9-a443-416d-afd4-475399f2a739-1
00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:24.990
an almost like a Mayan like town
that has many structures.

39db5cbc-c83f-4785-8b93-4aa83d71c7f3-0
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.685
So once again, it looks as
though it's it's taking place at

39db5cbc-c83f-4785-8b93-4aa83d71c7f3-1
00:46:29.685 --> 00:46:31.230
a different point in time.

12a5903e-2eec-4a5e-abb0-bcaeb514e627-0
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.653
There seems to be an A further
distance a bridge that's has

12a5903e-2eec-4a5e-abb0-bcaeb514e627-1
00:46:37.653 --> 00:46:38.210
fallen.

3a41f3e3-ee92-4ebd-b743-ba6e6607a682-0
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.290
Falling off and there is light.

ed595b61-53a2-4912-9af0-703c1a3f67fa-0
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.330
Um, that

3df1de26-114c-4b45-b1cc-68e6adf8d987-0
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:51.177
Is the bridge. The bridge that's
fallen is connected to a

3df1de26-114c-4b45-b1cc-68e6adf8d987-1
00:46:51.177 --> 00:46:53.610
structure that seems to.

f2b29504-15d8-4adc-baaa-d96c76e31017-0
00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.640
Have some kind of illumination
at a top of a tower.

fe8e258e-3625-41dc-a692-fa925b84ff04-0
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.300
There is a more careful.

3c36ce78-c56e-4702-85f4-45ac1ffa49f1-0
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.326
Picture of of the two boys. A
closer picture of the two boys

3c36ce78-c56e-4702-85f4-45ac1ffa49f1-1
00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:11.390
on a bridge that looked.

6d08bc9f-f5da-49dc-8686-7ce88fde4b7b-0
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.590
Unstable, but seems to still
work because they are running

6d08bc9f-f5da-49dc-8686-7ce88fde4b7b-1
00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:19.540
towards the.

fcff124d-595d-4791-baf1-c179ba57b4a1-0
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:24.742
The structure that has the
light, the bird is also still

fcff124d-595d-4791-baf1-c179ba57b4a1-1
00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:26.810
with them guiding the way.

cc0bb12d-0d4d-4761-b7af-ec0c980e5cb5-0
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.140
And it looks like it's during
the day.

39e1f29e-a42b-4e5c-82fb-07a873ad9b7a-0
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.490
Hmm.

eaf3c2b4-6549-407f-9991-b30e0a69de4b-0
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.320
Ohh OK.

998751f4-806a-4e58-94a1-d35d1bc14e57-0
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:36.760
Now.

2f7612fe-6894-437c-be8a-d4a186afe580-0
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:44.120
The two boys have reached the
top of the tower structure.

9d81fa48-6f1a-454b-8d7e-417b7e9b7c3f-0
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:51.634
Um, they are now looking towards
the medieval soldiers that are

9d81fa48-6f1a-454b-8d7e-417b7e9b7c3f-1
00:47:51.634 --> 00:47:58.289
actually coming after them, who
are 1234. At least five of them

9d81fa48-6f1a-454b-8d7e-417b7e9b7c3f-2
00:47:58.289 --> 00:48:03.280
are actually running on a very
unstable bridge.

dca51d7c-6e3b-4ee0-a48b-59e20284c144-0
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:10.285
And the bird and the two boys
are watching as the medieval

dca51d7c-6e3b-4ee0-a48b-59e20284c144-1
00:48:10.285 --> 00:48:15.513
soldiers are coming after them,
and so they are now once again

dca51d7c-6e3b-4ee0-a48b-59e20284c144-2
00:48:15.513 --> 00:48:20.575
trying to draw something so that
they could use it for their

dca51d7c-6e3b-4ee0-a48b-59e20284c144-3
00:48:20.575 --> 00:48:20.990
next.

8cee4dad-9cc4-4bab-af44-8d6e9fc091ff-0
00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:22.680
Escape.

a07bd3f9-1bdc-41e7-9ead-fef429b5548f-0
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.919
Yes, now I think. I think now
looks as though it's a boy and a

a07bd3f9-1bdc-41e7-9ead-fef429b5548f-1
00:48:31.919 --> 00:48:32.290
girl.

25f77f41-c021-4778-ab03-52fbcc2b0227-0
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:39.878
They are about to they barely
escape from the medieval army

25f77f41-c021-4778-ab03-52fbcc2b0227-1
00:48:39.878 --> 00:48:44.758
soldiers who are trying to
capture them because they were

25f77f41-c021-4778-ab03-52fbcc2b0227-2
00:48:44.758 --> 00:48:48.040
able to draw with their magic
crayons.

16a792e6-abf4-468a-b53f-e04ab7d2c06b-0
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.090
A picture of a big swing.

cfacb99e-63fe-4f0c-aa1c-abf4632ea693-0
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:59.840
As it is being pulled by a very
large purple dragonfly.

27212cbe-142d-4b95-aa9b-b2e08c614be5-0
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.620
And the dragonfly and the swing.

7e00df3b-2634-4dfe-8923-4b5049251e88-0
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.040
Have given them.

a96ca06e-3193-4804-bf7f-449c648be500-0
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:15.486
A ride to their next
destination, which is at the top

a96ca06e-3193-4804-bf7f-449c648be500-1
00:49:15.486 --> 00:49:17.570
of top of a mountain.

84d3882e-7d6f-4c26-9d87-d73ed96c7a98-0
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:26.240
At the top of a temple because
there is an image of a praying.

21d1b09b-a9b7-4e11-a6d7-b35722553578-0
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.950
Statue.

8c489dfe-78f9-4fe7-8493-c1bc08341599-0
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:35.311
On the structure that they land
on top of. Meanwhile, you see

8c489dfe-78f9-4fe7-8493-c1bc08341599-1
00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:41.012
pictures of the Army soldiers
still chasing after them. Now on

8c489dfe-78f9-4fe7-8493-c1bc08341599-2
00:49:41.012 --> 00:49:42.370
kind of balloon

516d4310-f875-46b4-b17e-34970e13cea6-0
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.160
Planes blimps.

1888157c-1c76-4ffa-a156-6dc225208897-0
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:54.976
The the the boy and a girl seems
to be able to collect these

1888157c-1c76-4ffa-a156-6dc225208897-1
00:49:54.976 --> 00:50:02.317
items. The these tubes that are
now in 1234566 different colors

1888157c-1c76-4ffa-a156-6dc225208897-2
00:50:02.317 --> 00:50:05.070
carrying it like a belt.

b0fbf69a-d603-4388-9332-62ce2d73f26f-0
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.830
And the other boy is holding on
to the mat.

5d6c4c79-bcb4-4b88-8130-ff2a552eea47-0
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:20.560
However, now they are being
surrounded by 12345.

27f2c12e-a2fa-4f2c-97ab-1acde5246bea-0
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:27.870
Balloon airplanes that are being
flown by the medieval.

6fe39736-e976-4b54-9708-116ef4c2ead8-0
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:35.265
Soldiers. There is one creature.
There's one person that is

6fe39736-e976-4b54-9708-116ef4c2ead8-1
00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:36.790
dressed in gold.

9fd045ae-607a-4d24-94cc-62f3009b2e4a-0
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.485
He seems to be the leader and
he's about to grab onto the

9fd045ae-607a-4d24-94cc-62f3009b2e4a-1
00:50:42.485 --> 00:50:42.870
bird.

f6ed2ae3-3029-473f-b738-8a3ed98cb77d-0
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:49.538
The purple bird that's been with
them throughout this adventure.

f6ed2ae3-3029-473f-b738-8a3ed98cb77d-1
00:50:49.538 --> 00:50:54.549
And there's another group of
army soldiers who is holding on

f6ed2ae3-3029-473f-b738-8a3ed98cb77d-2
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:59.723
to a bird cage. And so the idea
is for the for the, the leader

f6ed2ae3-3029-473f-b738-8a3ed98cb77d-3
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.120
of this military.

8fb135e7-d09b-4826-96f7-9eb4073115e8-0
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.480
Armed to capture the bird.

0c64d753-8ee9-4488-995f-20f9259777be-0
00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:16.495
However, the bird escapes after
grabbing the belt that has the

0c64d753-8ee9-4488-995f-20f9259777be-1
00:51:16.495 --> 00:51:22.851
tubes the the different colored
tubes and this tube is actually

0c64d753-8ee9-4488-995f-20f9259777be-2
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:25.830
allowing the boy and the girl.

0253763c-5599-4e62-977c-06b9f7accbe6-0
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:36.970
To maybe walk on as part of a
rainbow, there are two 123.

95aa3a61-de30-406c-98fe-318cccc0e9cb-0
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.640
I ballooned.

2e6810fd-28f2-4420-b4fb-bbbc8cb0b13a-0
00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.666
Airplanes that have been
disrupted by the power of the

2e6810fd-28f2-4420-b4fb-bbbc8cb0b13a-1
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:45.670
birds flying.

a5e02137-0bda-4dd4-8fda-65a05755bc8d-0
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:53.960
On carrying this magical belt
with colors and the boys are oh,

a5e02137-0bda-4dd4-8fda-65a05755bc8d-1
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.210
go ahead, go ahead.

e154e500-fa02-4cdc-920a-a901e729b630-0
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.575
And it looks as though the bird
was able to draw using the Magic

e154e500-fa02-4cdc-920a-a901e729b630-1
00:52:04.575 --> 00:52:10.600
belt draw a large, very large
rainbow that is in multi colors.

d06fbb56-d0a6-4dbf-ac71-702f0b5b1350-0
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.110
That.

5d82994c-bfa0-4438-b51f-527be7991713-0
00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:17.351
Starts from the top of the
temple where the two boys were

5d82994c-bfa0-4438-b51f-527be7991713-1
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:22.230
all the way to the boat that was
actually carrying the old man.

286bc6a9-acad-4a8d-8bd7-71e86cbcac34-0
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.980
And who has who has also been

2b0f5b40-57f3-4794-986a-ebc1f0d27192-0
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:31.572
Previously captured, it looks
like it was a long way, but

2b0f5b40-57f3-4794-986a-ebc1f0d27192-1
00:52:31.572 --> 00:52:35.090
because of the birds ability to
use the magic belt.

25bd4153-f4ac-428f-aea8-3c47ce59d56b-0
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:38.760
The old man is looking at.

e5ff68c0-7fe7-4cd0-819a-6c1987962228-0
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.573
The other range of the other end
of the rainbow, where he

e5ff68c0-7fe7-4cd0-819a-6c1987962228-1
00:52:43.573 --> 00:52:48.085
believes that he knows that he
has been rescued by the boys or

e5ff68c0-7fe7-4cd0-819a-6c1987962228-2
00:52:48.085 --> 00:52:49.590
the boy and the girl.

6a05968e-7606-4b78-87f8-17964223648d-0
00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:59.110
The picture now we see is.

17f0f766-e2d7-4d87-b720-fab7619703ec-0
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:00.730
Of.

ee44035b-0a92-4813-92bd-1574b52cbba6-0
00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:08.044
The man who must have been like
a king or somebody quite

ee44035b-0a92-4813-92bd-1574b52cbba6-1
00:53:08.044 --> 00:53:10.120
powerful at the 1st.

79cfbe12-b989-48b4-bf42-a4e9c7a12533-0
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.110
Medieval town.

abd9276a-7098-4cc4-a289-1d0877657388-0
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:19.724
He is being whisked on top of
the rhinoceros with the boy and

abd9276a-7098-4cc4-a289-1d0877657388-1
00:53:19.724 --> 00:53:25.545
a girl also joining. They are
leading a parade of of people

abd9276a-7098-4cc4-a289-1d0877657388-2
00:53:25.545 --> 00:53:29.620
who are coming back to the
medieval town.

9a8539f7-da48-422a-9164-309f277094e3-0
00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:35.453
Um, that is no longer occupied
by the military soldiers. But

9a8539f7-da48-422a-9164-309f277094e3-1
00:53:35.453 --> 00:53:36.950
have been rescued.

74877e70-a40a-422b-99d3-16b87a487cdb-0
00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:41.020
By the two, by the boy and a
girl and the bird.

13ad48ab-e042-4631-bc8b-d3ddaccd0cac-0
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.593
Um, so they're walking back.
They're they're being escorted

13ad48ab-e042-4631-bc8b-d3ddaccd0cac-1
00:53:47.593 --> 00:53:53.134
back to the medieval town. The
medieval town now has the

13ad48ab-e042-4631-bc8b-d3ddaccd0cac-2
00:53:53.134 --> 00:53:59.064
rainbow in the back. There are
people waving and and showing

13ad48ab-e042-4631-bc8b-d3ddaccd0cac-3
00:53:59.064 --> 00:54:05.383
signs of of welcoming. The man,
as well as the purple octopus is

13ad48ab-e042-4631-bc8b-d3ddaccd0cac-4
00:54:05.383 --> 00:54:05.870
also.

6cdf643f-70b6-49f4-bed0-fc0f2d2ecf77-0
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.250
In.

608c2505-d1b7-4363-9451-8024c32c50e1-0
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:09.960
The bed of the river.

c28e3fb9-8c0d-462d-ae66-9625865e42fe-0
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:13.580
Um, showing that he was also.

adf89f3c-dab5-4a7b-ab02-254ef1209e95-0
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:16.910
A participant of this adventure.

49556247-f7cb-47dc-838a-b3d093edf630-0
00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.100
And.

f0b1d758-6b11-4b65-b9e5-443d8e83ca80-0
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.580
Um.

cd5328b4-d547-4ef6-8b60-7e1cdd0c955e-0
00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:32.153
Now the old man is helping the
the children get off the

cd5328b4-d547-4ef6-8b60-7e1cdd0c955e-1
00:54:32.153 --> 00:54:38.541
rhinoceros and back closer to
the entrance to The Cave where

cd5328b4-d547-4ef6-8b60-7e1cdd0c955e-2
00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:45.243
they first entered the medieval
town. He's helping the girl get

cd5328b4-d547-4ef6-8b60-7e1cdd0c955e-3
00:54:45.243 --> 00:54:51.839
off the rhinoceros and down the
stairs, closer onto the steps.

3ddef224-5bde-404f-809d-220ed1705a08-0
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:59.937
They're octopuses also close by.
The Purple bird is also close

3ddef224-5bde-404f-809d-220ed1705a08-1
00:54:59.937 --> 00:55:00.260
by.

3e355b8b-d2f9-40ea-bd78-1e9b12b38317-0
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:08.780
Well, the the man is now drawing
what looks to be a crown.

c564871a-b0b6-432a-9309-6f003bb5eb7a-0
00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:13.360
Which he has drawn to.

1ce9fd04-21a5-4d83-aeb0-e41f926e89b1-0
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:19.455
And he has placed each of the
crown onto the boy and the girl

1ce9fd04-21a5-4d83-aeb0-e41f926e89b1-1
00:55:19.455 --> 00:55:25.080
as they waved goodbye and enter
back into The Cave entrance that

1ce9fd04-21a5-4d83-aeb0-e41f926e89b1-2
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.359
will lead them back to the park
entrance of the. The king is

1ce9fd04-21a5-4d83-aeb0-e41f926e89b1-3
00:55:30.359 --> 00:55:35.724
very grateful. He shows a lot of
gratitude by placing 2 hands

1ce9fd04-21a5-4d83-aeb0-e41f926e89b1-4
00:55:35.724 --> 00:55:41.350
together and the two boy and the
and the children waved goodbye.

e7cda14c-0057-459f-8885-ad0fe2700813-0
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.160
And the final picture is of.

b858736a-a563-4c37-b54a-76a49debc55b-0
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:52.835
The boy and the girl coming back
into their own world with a

b858736a-a563-4c37-b54a-76a49debc55b-1
00:55:52.835 --> 00:55:53.580
rainbow.

244bf28f-685d-4652-9682-e3aaa5f2ec38-0
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:56.040
At the.

8c138f92-0268-4bb7-94c3-c498ef87d38a-0
00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.550
#END_quest Also visible in the
sky.

433b7123-7120-452b-a669-d05381fc761e-0
00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.730
{Please tell us this story. Nice
story, yeah.}

3e29d874-1712-4fc1-9836-b14fb675382b-0
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.000
{OK, switching it up this time
though with the complex scene.

e70df0cb-beeb-4bc6-882f-63d9a6708ade-0
00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:17.246
Oh, do you need to see me?
That's fine, because I have to

e70df0cb-beeb-4bc6-882f-63d9a6708ade-1
00:56:17.246 --> 00:56:21.950
hold the computer quite close to
me, so that's fine, yeah.}

5908a37a-8194-4116-b76d-c7d148162b27-0
00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.941
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
OK, I think this is another

5908a37a-8194-4116-b76d-c7d148162b27-1
00:56:26.941 --> 00:56:27.670
scene of the Waldo.

63e525f3-b530-48d9-8b66-695d3767ce30-0
00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:29.460
Series.

30639092-f3c1-41b0-b634-6e217dc2ea30-0
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.690
This is a picture.

daef9cdd-98a5-4a08-928b-68ae345f21f5-0
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.210
Also lots of people.

d80c2f83-bdd1-4303-b448-ed787306f7ae-0
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:42.592
But it's saying that it's of
dinosaur spacemen and ghouls. So

d80c2f83-bdd1-4303-b448-ed787306f7ae-1
00:56:42.592 --> 00:56:47.450
it's a mixture of it looks as
though it's even like.

53fff30c-38f6-4c78-b7b1-3a2a7d95082b-0
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.220
It is set in a filming studio.

a1d96a8c-8162-4d84-8b34-ce6dcad937fb-0
00:56:53.630 --> 00:57:00.805
And various areas have different
themes. So there's one area that

a1d96a8c-8162-4d84-8b34-ce6dcad937fb-1
00:57:00.805 --> 00:57:04.720
shows a group of people in a
space.

86c50efb-5ae2-4a8f-92df-b717bea22032-0
00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:09.680
Uh, in in in outer space.

4ad47df0-2220-4679-9ad5-c9075a857fe0-0
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:16.120
There's like 1234567.

1c9fbd5d-5dab-402f-8de1-16400f0c7dcc-0
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:21.360
Um, spaceships and a group of.

ac60f157-9efd-457e-adef-070ae7555e72-0
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:28.784
Spaceman, as well as a upside
down rocket ship that seems to

ac60f157-9efd-457e-adef-070ae7555e72-1
00:57:28.784 --> 00:57:33.670
have landed incorrectly because
it is facing down.

d1537438-ce68-4d85-a245-7085b931102f-0
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:35.200
Um.

fcdb291d-ac7b-4576-b40d-fca8ab0e8fb8-0
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:40.732
But I think they're trying to
show that these spacemen are

fcdb291d-ac7b-4576-b40d-fca8ab0e8fb8-1
00:57:40.732 --> 00:57:43.690
flying because they're all
harnessed.

62c8cd8b-7724-4e6e-bc1e-da005e38bc4e-0
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.190
On strings but.

3511def7-65e1-473a-981e-248183d0f258-0
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:52.948
It looks like they don't really
have good grasps of their

3511def7-65e1-473a-981e-248183d0f258-1
00:57:52.948 --> 00:57:58.540
movement because a few of them
have landed on the floor. There

3511def7-65e1-473a-981e-248183d0f258-2
00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.050
seems to also be.

6225591f-583f-450b-95f1-c7318c0504ad-0
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.420
Outer creature type.

af6d7565-8b30-43ee-8702-f43fbaee7312-0
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:05.990
Um.

df83d029-f52c-41a5-b04b-585efda30bd8-0
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.500
Figures interspersed with the
spaceman.

42f45156-9b03-431d-8eca-05158c18f8f2-0
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.240
In this scene.

e9a1e550-4460-44dd-af16-6715d205ad6d-0
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:20.997
It's funny that there's there's
a guy on a ladder that's still

e9a1e550-4460-44dd-af16-6715d205ad6d-1
00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:26.064
trying to paint the the sky to
the that showing that it's outer

e9a1e550-4460-44dd-af16-6715d205ad6d-2
00:58:26.064 --> 00:58:26.540
space.

ab0c5eb2-a824-47b7-9478-5af557f2a379-0
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:32.085
So it looks as though they're
doing it in a very haphazard

ab0c5eb2-a824-47b7-9478-5af557f2a379-1
00:58:32.085 --> 00:58:33.410
way. There is a.

1ee0aa5c-798b-475f-a816-82c22473b591-0
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:39.110
Into the right side with picture
there is a man who is.

fd8a7fa2-6334-48df-9d84-5efa230941fa-0
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:41.540
Trying to film.

f9fc8c39-979e-43e6-b5ff-ab7d782ddf07-0
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:47.230
Many of these scenes with a big
camera.

f0790dbf-1a04-40e5-9971-a41a832f8d5d-0
00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.170
On a.

7073865f-55a2-4de5-b6ea-1fb869b0074c-0
00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.950
On a crane like structure.

16531632-2289-4644-aa51-5d4dec317760-0
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:59.727
But it's hard to tell whether
he's taking a picture of these,

16531632-2289-4644-aa51-5d4dec317760-1
00:58:59.727 --> 00:59:04.609
the outer space scene, or
there's actually a scene to the

16531632-2289-4644-aa51-5d4dec317760-2
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:06.040
left of the page.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:13.532
Of the medieval, not even the
medieval times. The Cavemen ages

6e9c031c-3344-46d2-8751-4a92136e9d06-1
00:59:13.532 --> 00:59:19.888
where there are dinosaurs and a
group of of Cavemen who are

6e9c031c-3344-46d2-8751-4a92136e9d06-2
00:59:19.888 --> 00:59:25.290
either dancing or fighting or
being scared though.

5f3a5060-8036-4905-b9a6-7bf979023bf3-0
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.874
The dinosaurs and other
dinosaurs look very scary. They

5f3a5060-8036-4905-b9a6-7bf979023bf3-1
00:59:29.874 --> 00:59:34.140
all seem a little silly because
even one dinosaur that's asleep.

403f28a7-5445-4caa-aa63-3c1f29501220-0
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:39.134
Or is it another dinosaur that
doesn't mind being written upon

403f28a7-5445-4caa-aa63-3c1f29501220-1
00:59:39.134 --> 00:59:41.070
or drawn upon by the caveman

7d481d40-ff95-4ed0-a7dc-3318a3637673-0
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.230
There is another.

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.600
Uh.

48beba1b-4472-441d-bca9-4ef28ed1a255-0
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.840
Dinosaur that looks as though
he's being tickled.

cc83d034-1085-4ec6-89e0-6cc320b821b4-0
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.020
Um.

09498a9d-c2b5-4f43-bbf1-36220f446258-0
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:58.560
And this is also a part of a a
scene in a in a.

f81af8f8-1f6c-4c10-bd6e-f8bc32491eb1-0
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.681
It's a studio because there are
lights at the top of the page

f81af8f8-1f6c-4c10-bd6e-f8bc32491eb1-1
01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:07.926
that shows that this is all
fake. There's also like a fake

f81af8f8-1f6c-4c10-bd6e-f8bc32491eb1-2
01:00:07.926 --> 01:00:12.244
volcano and part of the scene
between the dinosaurs and the

f81af8f8-1f6c-4c10-bd6e-f8bc32491eb1-3
01:00:12.244 --> 01:00:12.820
caveman.

page is actual.

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:24.350
Actors.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.130
What do you call the powder
rooms?

1df667de-b499-479b-8509-7508ef528c40-0
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.450
There are actors getting ready.

f7e4f9d6-547e-43c2-9085-b3cced2cdf13-0
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.010
For these various films, films.

7071159f-cc60-4155-aec0-d2c4977b2540-0
01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:41.103
Production scenes they're in the
changing rooms, they're getting

7071159f-cc60-4155-aec0-d2c4977b2540-1
01:00:41.103 --> 01:00:45.288
costumes. Some of them are
having their facial and their

7071159f-cc60-4155-aec0-d2c4977b2540-2
01:00:45.288 --> 01:00:46.169
makeup done.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.560
Um.

5a507fe6-9dcd-4ef0-ac80-1f169d3adb3b-0
01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.860
And then in the middle of.

98726a89-0b0d-47b4-840b-5bec53f090bb-0
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:56.016
There is one there. There's
another scene that is being

98726a89-0b0d-47b4-840b-5bec53f090bb-1
01:00:56.016 --> 01:00:56.540
filmed.

f486e2a9-d5e5-4ec7-845c-ebd31fbae697-0
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.530
Hard to tell what it is. It's
taking place in a.

abdade92-9e10-4a66-9263-f50f42ef37de-0
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:07.926
Maybe it's like supposed to be
like a scary picture because

abdade92-9e10-4a66-9263-f50f42ef37de-1
01:01:07.926 --> 01:01:09.220
there's some mummies.

4a96a96c-7267-4f31-9a23-fcd79723c8b4-0
01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:16.804
And a tree that looks as though
it's supposed to talk, and a lot

4a96a96c-7267-4f31-9a23-fcd79723c8b4-1
01:01:16.804 --> 01:01:17.080
of.

2a3952ee-ecc1-421d-a823-8ca7eb0b47cc-0
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.510
Just eyes staring from the
window.

d13ade2c-ccc8-4e35-bb72-cb2e8de2f6f1-0
01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:25.651
There's some bats, so it's I
think it's supposed to be a

d13ade2c-ccc8-4e35-bb72-cb2e8de2f6f1-1
01:01:25.651 --> 01:01:26.250
scary scene.

4c01915e-9b30-4ef4-91fc-9ee3a9f791d4-0
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:30.690
But intermixed with the mummies,
there's some.

3951d757-9fbd-4034-8afb-fe276cb1fbe1-0
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.700
People dressed as goats, ghosts.

212b5c29-9cd8-47c1-856c-adc2333430e5-0
01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.355
There's actually like a dinosaur
that's also from another scene

212b5c29-9cd8-47c1-856c-adc2333430e5-1
01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:47.957
that's being part of this this
filming. And then the final

212b5c29-9cd8-47c1-856c-adc2333430e5-2
01:01:47.957 --> 01:01:50.900
filming scene takes place in a.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:57.377
Either a cafeteria or maybe it's
not even a filming screen. Maybe

7475ccaa-306e-45d1-be33-0e10865935e8-1
01:01:57.377 --> 01:01:59.510
it's part of the the actors.

ccbd42fd-e3a1-4ffa-8bce-8550fbffdaa7-0
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.880
Umm.

71fe09cc-c2e1-418b-9912-50b2b8243230-0
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:07.181
Feeding the actors and actresses
and people who are part of the

71fe09cc-c2e1-418b-9912-50b2b8243230-1
01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:07.500
film.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.460
Crew food because it looks like
it's.

34dbb755-3c66-4802-9f5c-d2e2e254e689-0
01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:17.182
It's a cafeteria. People are
eating. Some people are dressed

34dbb755-3c66-4802-9f5c-d2e2e254e689-1
01:02:17.182 --> 01:02:19.200
in costumes, other people are

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.890
Just trying to grab some food.
There's a caveman, there's a

24790873-f7a0-4954-ad87-c3b3c0f92f98-1
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:25.010
dinosaur, there's a.

A space person, they're all

01:02:30.504 --> 01:02:33.460
intermingled in a very busy
cafeteria.

dce4aed5-3243-4b4d-bdbe-0824c393ff43-0
01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:36.290

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:38.570
So let's.}
