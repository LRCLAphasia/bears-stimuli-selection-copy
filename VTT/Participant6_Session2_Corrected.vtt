00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.974
OK. So as a reminder, there will
be two types of stimuli that you

54801661-dcd7-43b6-81b0-ac3f2a10d84a-1
00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:14.480
see or the pictures that you
see.

730010bd-70ef-41bc-a934-778792ee4875-0
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.806
This is an example of a wordless
picture books in which you will

730010bd-70ef-41bc-a934-778792ee4875-1
00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:22.810
see a series of picture that
tells a story.

29fbb813-d875-43d4-9aa4-bffe4bee3b53-0
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.670
Of the story between 10 to 15
minutes and describe in describe

29fbb813-d875-43d4-9aa4-bffe4bee3b53-1
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.780
what you see and what is
happening. I mean as much detail

29fbb813-d875-43d4-9aa4-bffe4bee3b53-2
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.450
as you can and whenever you're
ready. OK, all right.

3c4fb4c2-77bd-4b02-9717-493127f1dc58-0
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.880
#START_quest So the story is.

698b2582-95cd-419d-8910-480ddb890757-0
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.893
Maybe I I guess it's titled for
Darcy. Maybe. I would assume

698b2582-95cd-419d-8910-480ddb890757-1
00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:56.690
that's a person or an animal.
Some somebody is, I guess,

698b2582-95cd-419d-8910-480ddb890757-2
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.097
dedicating this story to Darcy.
Whoever that person is, it's a

698b2582-95cd-419d-8910-480ddb890757-3
00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:09.606
picture of is, like somebody's
in a park within a city. There's

698b2582-95cd-419d-8910-480ddb890757-4
00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:15.809
a street lamp, a park bench, a
trash can, and then a bridge.

98ad3516-4a94-4803-a3ec-c65c867ced97-0
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.026
Um, and it's the underside of
the bridge. There is a statue at

98ad3516-4a94-4803-a3ec-c65c867ced97-1
00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.630
the entrance to the bridge of a.

17fc4d55-33bf-43e3-b46c-ee6ea60c398b-0
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.351
Person holding up possibly a
candle, and the person has

17fc4d55-33bf-43e3-b46c-ee6ea60c398b-1
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:30.960
wings.

defd6eeb-bfee-456e-b6ff-2881f483b503-0
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.910
And then under the bridge there
is what appears to be a little

defd6eeb-bfee-456e-b6ff-2881f483b503-1
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.452
boy and a little girl, and they
are sheltering under the bridge

defd6eeb-bfee-456e-b6ff-2881f483b503-2
00:01:41.452 --> 00:01:46.136
there they have a double bicycle
and they're sheltering under the

defd6eeb-bfee-456e-b6ff-2881f483b503-3
00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:50.040
bridge because it it looks like
it is raining outside.

323d28cd-8776-4fd0-9a90-9f268424d2f8-0
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.530
Oh boy. OK.

622cf481-6485-4f02-877d-4f6e7364e928-0
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.290
Um.

fa3a8f68-99da-4034-b530-6073f671f7aa-0
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.297
Is it possible to go back? Yes.
OK. Sorry, I'm trying to figure

fa3a8f68-99da-4034-b530-6073f671f7aa-1
00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:13.014
out. OK, so I'll add to that.
They're sheltering under this

fa3a8f68-99da-4034-b530-6073f671f7aa-2
00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:18.159
bridge and they're standing just
to the right of two.

04052bee-8bce-4a86-a81d-a57e12980dea-0
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.739
Double wooden doors and there's
a overhead light that hangs

04052bee-8bce-4a86-a81d-a57e12980dea-1
00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.683
above the door that is shining
down in front of the doors. Now

04052bee-8bce-4a86-a81d-a57e12980dea-2
00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:30.960
I think we're good to go, OK?

000360f7-1371-49a1-b61f-df12f90cf488-0
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.122
And then all of a sudden, the
two wooden doors open and an

000360f7-1371-49a1-b61f-df12f90cf488-1
00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:45.134
older man wearing a long orange
type of robe, maybe with an

000360f7-1371-49a1-b61f-df12f90cf488-2
00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:51.247
orange crown. He's got long
white hair, white Gray hair, and

000360f7-1371-49a1-b61f-df12f90cf488-3
00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:57.160
a long white Gray beard. He also
has some kind of a brown.

2ccdd70b-318f-4a38-a0e6-8d4d2ff9cdcf-0
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.176
Like sash or um kind of covering
over the robe that he's wearing

2ccdd70b-318f-4a38-a0e6-8d4d2ff9cdcf-1
00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:07.940
and he.

5cbf4760-1f4c-44c1-978c-933c75366759-0
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.610
The little girl is holding a
little red.

3d3fbdea-4963-4fd5-8872-c3b580a4ee95-0
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.070
Stick the little boy is holding
a purple stick.

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-0
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.952
And the man is holding an orange
stick. And he is showing the the

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-1
00:03:23.952 --> 00:03:28.586
boy and the girl who appeared
quite frightened by the man who

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-2
00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:33.220
has come out from the door, he
is showing them a picture of a

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-3
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.779
circle and on on the circle
there's different color, smaller

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-4
00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.563
circles. So there's a green, a
small green circle, then a small

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-5
00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:47.197
yellow, then an orange, then a
red, then a purple, and then a

d3aaa3f5-f46b-4254-ba28-96e7ec9d52b8-6
00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:47.870
blue and.

d45491d3-bf38-40df-84ea-df3b48cf4ca3-0
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.145
He is telling the boy and the
girl to be quiet. He's holding

d45491d3-bf38-40df-84ea-df3b48cf4ca3-1
00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:56.077
up his finger to his mouth to
indicate that they should be

d45491d3-bf38-40df-84ea-df3b48cf4ca3-2
00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:59.410
quiet and above the boy and the
girl is a purple.

db255ecc-7bc2-46b4-b028-e3d1bce77d41-0
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.766
Kind of a bird with a very long
tail that is also looking down

db255ecc-7bc2-46b4-b028-e3d1bce77d41-1
00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:07.980
at this picture.

1134c0fc-41df-42f8-ada1-01b90115b810-0
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.990
And.

e0ecbb78-788c-4836-8d51-74c541fb363c-0
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.249
It looks like the boy then, or
I'm sorry. The man then takes

e0ecbb78-788c-4836-8d51-74c541fb363c-1
00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:24.977
the sash, this brown sash that
he's wearing, which has it looks

e0ecbb78-788c-4836-8d51-74c541fb363c-2
00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:29.810
like maybe the sash holds the
different color sticks.

c185e469-cc52-42bf-86ed-c875b13e219a-0
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.630
Um and the man puts the sash on
the little boy.

201b10de-609b-4f54-838b-238f3b0ccb4d-0
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.040
And I'm sorry on the little
girl. And then he gives.

4ec9f830-85be-424e-a535-dbd624b967e2-0
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.030
The picture to the little boy.

51b73b09-3ed5-4a04-9de9-39980a32345b-0
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.015
And I'm going to have to move
you. Sorry, one SEC. OK. And

51b73b09-3ed5-4a04-9de9-39980a32345b-1
00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:50.810
then he.

1642d5eb-494f-4845-b8d0-998d48fbd80c-0
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.614
All of a sudden there are two.
Two people come in what appears

1642d5eb-494f-4845-b8d0-998d48fbd80c-1
00:04:56.614 --> 00:04:59.770
to be like full body armor.
They're like.

1a50cebf-3486-459e-afab-ea4096ba0960-0
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.630
Looks like like a metal body
armor, and they're holding 2.

cfc9a8ff-87e8-4e59-9fc3-a119fed34b94-0
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.240
Umm.

61178187-8f86-457f-be51-8729105f9b61-0
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.048
God, what are they called?
They're not swords, they're

61178187-8f86-457f-be51-8729105f9b61-1
00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:11.580
they're like.

c1258a8f-7bc3-48ba-9988-158395b464f1-0
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.820
Daggers, I guess, or.

5f14b9e6-8524-444b-b041-f0093f5cdc70-0
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.320
I hope I get the right word, but
they're holding these two.

6661ac1a-bbed-44c4-af9b-3c55a12f3186-0
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.529
Long dagger type things that
have a point at the end. I don't

6661ac1a-bbed-44c4-af9b-3c55a12f3186-1
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.591
know if I'm saying the right
word. I feel like it's escaping

6661ac1a-bbed-44c4-af9b-3c55a12f3186-2
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:35.721
me and they grab the old man and
the old man loses his orange

6661ac1a-bbed-44c4-af9b-3c55a12f3186-3
00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:40.050
stick. It goes flying out of his
hand when the two men grab him.

e60430ad-9008-4457-930c-7222233edbda-0
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.610
And.

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-0
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.019
The kids kind of lean back and
they two men take in the body

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-1
00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:51.415
armor, take the old man back
into the doorway, which it

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-2
00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:56.362
appears leads to maybe some kind
of a tunnel. And the kids are

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-3
00:05:56.362 --> 00:06:01.072
kind of crouched down with this
purple bird who's also with

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-4
00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:05.233
them. And they're kind of
watching as the old man is

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-5
00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:09.866
trying to reach out for them,
but he is being carried back

834b78c8-998c-49f9-b8ee-2340cef7b06d-6
00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:12.300
into this tunnel and his stick.

35561681-6cdf-4f63-9cc0-73c6ef67e704-0
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.930
Is lying on the ground.

0fa24ca0-63f7-494a-a5fc-e5b6f640113c-0
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.206
So then in the next scene,
excuse me, the little girl picks

0fa24ca0-63f7-494a-a5fc-e5b6f640113c-1
00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:23.430
up.

3d3512ee-144e-4857-ac8e-437b7e2ba755-0
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.751
The man's orange stick, and she
places it into one of the

3d3512ee-144e-4857-ac8e-437b7e2ba755-1
00:06:27.751 --> 00:06:29.010
holders on her sash.

55afbefb-4847-4fb4-88eb-86c2b71aa542-0
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.602
She's still carrying her red
stick and the boy is still

55afbefb-4847-4fb4-88eb-86c2b71aa542-1
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:37.292
carrying his purple stick and
he's got the picture and the

55afbefb-4847-4fb4-88eb-86c2b71aa542-2
00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:41.232
little arm or the little Purple
bird is on the shoulder of the

55afbefb-4847-4fb4-88eb-86c2b71aa542-3
00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:41.920
little boy.

4fd94a81-6205-4899-9f32-ce56c0223d8c-0
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.175
And the doors, the wooden doors
closed because they've taken the

4fd94a81-6205-4899-9f32-ce56c0223d8c-1
00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:56.650
man back inside. And they, the
two young children are trying to

4fd94a81-6205-4899-9f32-ce56c0223d8c-2
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.460
oh with.

191ac552-44e4-4c71-b489-f1f76a8b87d0-0
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.804
With the sticks are we realized
now that the sticks can draw.

191ac552-44e4-4c71-b489-f1f76a8b87d0-1
00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:08.670
They can also be a type of a
crayon. So the girl begins to

191ac552-44e4-4c71-b489-f1f76a8b87d0-2
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.949
draw a key with her red crayon
and the boy begins to draw a key

191ac552-44e4-4c71-b489-f1f76a8b87d0-3
00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.064
with his purple one. And then
they are able to once they draw

191ac552-44e4-4c71-b489-f1f76a8b87d0-4
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:24.425
the keys, the keys kind of come
to life. Each one is holds a key

191ac552-44e4-4c71-b489-f1f76a8b87d0-5
00:07:24.425 --> 00:07:28.220
to the matching color of the
stick or crayon.

058fc008-185a-4146-9cc7-cfdc49a128aa-0
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.780
That they have and the bird is
kind of watching them and they

058fc008-185a-4146-9cc7-cfdc49a128aa-1
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.199
hold up the keys and they put
each one puts their key in the

058fc008-185a-4146-9cc7-cfdc49a128aa-2
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:41.835
one of the double doors and they
then open the double doors and

058fc008-185a-4146-9cc7-cfdc49a128aa-3
00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:46.398
head into the tunnel along with
this purple bird to go and try

058fc008-185a-4146-9cc7-cfdc49a128aa-4
00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:47.630
to find this man.

3e6536b2-804b-4fbd-ac97-b6137ca70736-0
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.290
Oh wow.

39078657-4b39-41b3-9cab-5f87fc5d39d1-0
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.292
So when they travel through the
tunnel, the other side of the

39078657-4b39-41b3-9cab-5f87fc5d39d1-1
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:00.540
tunnel leads to.

57494844-f057-4bd2-9ef2-377dac5c6366-0
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.760
A body of water. So the tunnel
is almost built into like a

57494844-f057-4bd2-9ef2-377dac5c6366-1
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.737
Cliff side because it's it looks
like rock and and dirt. And

57494844-f057-4bd2-9ef2-377dac5c6366-2
00:08:14.737 --> 00:08:18.950
above the Cliff you can tell
that there's.

ba620b60-89a6-49b8-a24b-7893cad591fc-0
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.936
A grassy like vegetative area
that's above on the top part of

ba620b60-89a6-49b8-a24b-7893cad591fc-1
00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:29.352
this Cliff, but there is some
water that it appears is coming

ba620b60-89a6-49b8-a24b-7893cad591fc-2
00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:33.626
down through either a pipe or
something from the top of the

ba620b60-89a6-49b8-a24b-7893cad591fc-3
00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:37.687
Cliff and it pours over the
Cliff into the body of water

ba620b60-89a6-49b8-a24b-7893cad591fc-4
00:08:37.687 --> 00:08:40.750
that the the tunnel door kind of
leads to.

966a8774-b446-4f74-a079-e88f6f2937e0-0
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.914
On the other, it's not a big
body of water. Um, I would say

966a8774-b446-4f74-a079-e88f6f2937e0-1
00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:48.560
it's like a little bit of like
a.

a992edb5-92bc-4853-b517-68407abfd8a3-0
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.520
Umm.

22a11703-6beb-413e-97da-e534fe976748-0
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:58.701
I don't know if it's a canal
maybe, but on the other side of

22a11703-6beb-413e-97da-e534fe976748-1
00:08:58.701 --> 00:08:59.710
the water.

9f6b29d1-1a59-4c69-9434-2a073d45d819-0
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.740
Is there's some vegetation and
then on that ground there is.

56ad7a95-2326-403e-b92e-b88d77772f7a-0
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.490
A big.

3ef090f3-164f-4e84-ab62-214bf9db1b21-0
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.446
It almost kind of looks like a
castle. It's very castle like,

3ef090f3-164f-4e84-ab62-214bf9db1b21-1
00:09:15.446 --> 00:09:20.363
but I believe it's different
buildings. So on the other side

3ef090f3-164f-4e84-ab62-214bf9db1b21-2
00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:22.619
is another very tall bridge.

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-0
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.386
That underneath the bridge there
is a boat that has the two men

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-1
00:09:28.386 --> 00:09:32.920
in the body armor that took the
old man, the old man, and then

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-2
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.879
there appeared to be other
people, Umm, a couple other

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-3
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:41.342
people wearing body armor. And
then the other people that are

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-4
00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:45.804
on the boat appear to be dressed
in green and they're kind of

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-5
00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:50.482
leading. They're telling the old
man to head to the front of the

29a23fe7-76bb-4730-955d-6c057c4c6df9-6
00:09:50.482 --> 00:09:53.289
boat and the boat is headed
under the.

9c24d122-914e-42c3-be19-be02a97975d7-0
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.120
Bridge.

3a074bf3-4129-4c43-98a2-abaf79bddded-0
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.811
Um, and again there's there's
people in body armor above the

3a074bf3-4129-4c43-98a2-abaf79bddded-1
00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:04.375
bridge kind of guarding. There
are in some of the other

3a074bf3-4129-4c43-98a2-abaf79bddded-2
00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:09.265
buildings. You can tell that
there's people with body armor

3a074bf3-4129-4c43-98a2-abaf79bddded-3
00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:14.644
guarding. There's some planes in
the air that are carrying people

3a074bf3-4129-4c43-98a2-abaf79bddded-4
00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:19.615
with body who have this body
armor. So they look like guards

3a074bf3-4129-4c43-98a2-abaf79bddded-5
00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:21.490
of some port some type.

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-0
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.648
And it looks like there is some
fires at the top of some of the

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-1
00:10:27.648 --> 00:10:32.539
buildings because it you can see
some red and orange coming up

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-2
00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:37.353
from the top of the buildings
and that leads into smoke. So I

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-3
00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:42.321
would assume that maybe there is
some kind of a war or somebody

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-4
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:47.212
has taken over this little city
area and some of the buildings

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-5
00:10:47.212 --> 00:10:51.948
are on fire and and so the kids
have exited out through that

94ec63bd-1b3e-459d-a6e8-0f27bd111eba-6
00:10:51.948 --> 00:10:52.879
tunnel door.

c57c5efc-84e0-4eca-a93f-baa4bd8c082c-0
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.269
And they're not quite in the
water, but there's a couple of

c57c5efc-84e0-4eca-a93f-baa4bd8c082c-1
00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:01.784
large rocks that lead out into
the water, and they are perched

c57c5efc-84e0-4eca-a93f-baa4bd8c082c-2
00:11:01.784 --> 00:11:05.653
on one of the large rocks
watching this boat take the

c57c5efc-84e0-4eca-a93f-baa4bd8c082c-3
00:11:05.653 --> 00:11:08.090
older gentleman under the
bridge.

06b2e733-cd15-4202-8447-e4def0f745c4-0
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.935
So now we have a view where you
can actually tell that the water

06b2e733-cd15-4202-8447-e4def0f745c4-1
00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:22.720
is much bigger when you when the
water goes through or under the

06b2e733-cd15-4202-8447-e4def0f745c4-2
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.211
bridge, it leads out to more
water. So it looks like it is a

06b2e733-cd15-4202-8447-e4def0f745c4-3
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:31.481
bigger body of water. The kids
are still at this rock and

06b2e733-cd15-4202-8447-e4def0f745c4-4
00:11:31.481 --> 00:11:35.898
they're looking at the map,
they're, they're looking at the

06b2e733-cd15-4202-8447-e4def0f745c4-5
00:11:35.898 --> 00:11:38.770
different circles that are on
the map.

6c10d4b7-cb5f-482b-a870-1482fe89ea6f-0
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.895
And they're looking at the
yellow circle or the the little

6c10d4b7-cb5f-482b-a870-1482fe89ea6f-1
00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:50.351
girl's pointing to the yellow
circle. And the next frame we

6c10d4b7-cb5f-482b-a870-1482fe89ea6f-2
00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:56.080
see a closer picture of the. We
see a close up of the picture,

6c10d4b7-cb5f-482b-a870-1482fe89ea6f-3
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.991
which appears to also be kind of
a map. Even though it's got the

6c10d4b7-cb5f-482b-a870-1482fe89ea6f-4
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.720
circles drawn, we can tell now
that the.

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-0
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.297
Red. So the red is drawn around
to the purple, and then the

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-1
00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:16.519
orange draws around to the
purple. Yellow draws around to

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-2
00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:20.741
the purple. So on one side of
the purple you only see the

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-3
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:25.036
purple, but on the other side
you see all of the different

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-4
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:29.403
colors drawn into the purple.
And each smaller circle has a

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-5
00:12:29.403 --> 00:12:33.989
different scene on the inside of
that circle. For instance, it

d27a5171-18b6-44de-9d3d-96128b300584-6
00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:37.119
begins with the Red circle,
which has the.

486ed91b-c419-4304-a6ca-30e200082fb4-0
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.084
Picture of under the bridge
where the two kids were by the

486ed91b-c419-4304-a6ca-30e200082fb4-1
00:12:41.084 --> 00:12:45.070
wooden doors. That's the scene
for the Red Circle, the orange

486ed91b-c419-4304-a6ca-30e200082fb4-2
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.550
circle where they took.

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-0
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.642
The man is a picture of this
little city that they saw when

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-1
00:12:52.642 --> 00:12:57.060
they come, came through the
tunnel and they're pointing to

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-2
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.853
the yellow circle, which would
be the next in the sequence. And

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-3
00:13:01.853 --> 00:13:06.346
that is a picture of another
building, but it appears to be

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-4
00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:10.614
underwater because it's got
some, it looks like it's got

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-5
00:13:10.614 --> 00:13:15.032
some sea plants around it and
that there are fish swimming

107f82f4-6331-4ecc-b537-77143eb316e0-6
00:13:15.032 --> 00:13:16.530
above this building.

659c0a28-060f-43ab-97ed-1eb99b098b43-0
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:24.841
And then on the behind that is
kind of a a hand drawn map of

659c0a28-060f-43ab-97ed-1eb99b098b43-1
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:30.684
vegetation, mountains, water.
It's like a hand drawn map of

659c0a28-060f-43ab-97ed-1eb99b098b43-2
00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:34.970
what the layout of the land
looks like. OK.

9bfea008-13ee-40c0-85a0-0cfcdaf6ec04-0
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:44.090
Alright, so still on the still
kind of perched on the rock.

04533cc8-b24f-4003-822e-00b04c04786a-0
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.890
The two kids then see some
smaller little boats.

ea56d0c5-1f20-41fc-a7f5-ef0b43e0bb2a-0
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.313
Like gondola type boats that
come around through the water

ea56d0c5-1f20-41fc-a7f5-ef0b43e0bb2a-1
00:13:56.313 --> 00:14:01.518
and they are carrying more men
in body armor. The first boat,

ea56d0c5-1f20-41fc-a7f5-ef0b43e0bb2a-2
00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:02.610
however, has.

daf7cfff-6011-48e7-b794-e51aae0ebabf-0
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.380
Uh.

45d8335e-7ae7-4b84-84fd-b86cf86d63fc-0
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.614
A man wearing yellow. I can't
tell if it's body armor or if

45d8335e-7ae7-4b84-84fd-b86cf86d63fc-1
00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:13.917
it's just his his uniform, but
he has some kind of a. He also

45d8335e-7ae7-4b84-84fd-b86cf86d63fc-2
00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:18.012
has some kind of a crown or
something on his head. And you

45d8335e-7ae7-4b84-84fd-b86cf86d63fc-3
00:14:18.012 --> 00:14:22.107
can tell he is leading the men
in the body armor and he is

45d8335e-7ae7-4b84-84fd-b86cf86d63fc-4
00:14:22.107 --> 00:14:26.480
pointing to the rock that the
two young kids are on. And then.

2f79377b-1983-47c6-8baa-b71a7cf2e43a-0
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.990
In the next scene we see.

efd4e41c-5da4-458f-94eb-0c0ed4ef0e14-0
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.135
Each we see the boy and the girl
pull out their sticks and begin

efd4e41c-5da4-458f-94eb-0c0ed4ef0e14-1
00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:36.680
to draw.

1027f0c2-6104-4a3c-ac1e-10ad4e357c8d-0
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.390
Begin to draw.

b1f5ad42-c170-4298-9908-01bb1134f9c7-0
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.370


be22cfa9-b18d-4dd6-9330-eb00020cc5ce-0
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.780
Oh God, what are those things
called?

399ab735-336c-4bb5-9575-4ff6d48c71b5-0
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.010
Umm.

87b2948a-d996-48ab-bbf2-9881236da226-0
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.111
They're like the they're like
the flappers that you put on

87b2948a-d996-48ab-bbf2-9881236da226-1
00:14:52.111 --> 00:14:55.360
your feet when you swim. So you
have kind of like webbed feet.

cb8757ed-66f4-47d5-a21d-2a8de5b5b0b1-0
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.133
So the little girl is drawing
those and it also appears that

cb8757ed-66f4-47d5-a21d-2a8de5b5b0b1-1
00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:07.600
she is drawing like a tank and
headgear for them to be able to

cb8757ed-66f4-47d5-a21d-2a8de5b5b0b1-2
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.154
wear to go into the water. And
then the boy it looks like he is

cb8757ed-66f4-47d5-a21d-2a8de5b5b0b1-3
00:15:13.154 --> 00:15:18.014
drawing possibly an octopus. It
looks like he's drawing

cb8757ed-66f4-47d5-a21d-2a8de5b5b0b1-4
00:15:18.014 --> 00:15:20.010
tentacles of some sort.

361552d6-c893-443b-b4aa-b53ffb36eba6-0
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.420
And then then in the next scene
you see.

be04a397-260c-4943-b485-f25b0e675dff-0
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.650
Just the feet of the children
both wearing these little.

45c90202-5902-4f90-8e05-a5a607dffcdd-0
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.458
Swim, swim flappers I guess on
their feet. And then you can see

45c90202-5902-4f90-8e05-a5a607dffcdd-1
00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:37.710
the tentacles kind of still in
the water as well and they have

45c90202-5902-4f90-8e05-a5a607dffcdd-2
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.870
it It shows that they have then.

c0a77861-fce6-4ed3-938b-1eba7fbdd1e0-0
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.700
They've dove into the water to
go under, to go under the water.

638ee466-7712-406f-80fa-6d12272c87f8-0
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.000
Alright, let me move you back.

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-0
00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.780
Once OK, once under the water
that you can see that they they

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-1
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.327
have on their gear, they have on
their tanks or oxygen tanks

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-2
00:16:05.327 --> 00:16:09.649
their headgear. The little boy
still has the picture, the

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-3
00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:14.270
little girl still has the sash
and they are hold and the bird

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-4
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:19.040
is with them as well. The Purple
bird is with them as well. And

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-5
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.661
they have each grabbed a hold of
one of the tentacles of it's

65cb09c8-893a-4c39-9640-905f54c9f3cb-6
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:25.449
kind of like an octopus.

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-0
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.813
But it doesn't have the head of
it as little different. It's uh,

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-1
00:16:30.813 --> 00:16:35.681
I'm not quite sure what the head
is like, but whatever this

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-2
00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:40.306
creature is has has a lot of
tentacles, 123456789, 10, I

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-3
00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:45.417
believe. There's 10 tentacles
and they're each holding one and

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-4
00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:50.123
this creature is taking them
down under the water to this

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-5
00:16:50.123 --> 00:16:55.397
little underground city and you
can see the building that was in

0b50808b-1a1d-401a-b544-64263b7b1b0a-6
00:16:55.397 --> 00:16:56.290
the yellow.

f0aac5a1-5d5b-4e52-b7a0-b85ba8c5cbfd-0
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.226
circle on the picture is within
this city and it is lit up, so

f0aac5a1-5d5b-4e52-b7a0-b85ba8c5cbfd-1
00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:05.783
it is taking them down to that
building and you can see it

f0aac5a1-5d5b-4e52-b7a0-b85ba8c5cbfd-2
00:17:05.783 --> 00:17:10.650
looks like there might be some
sharks and some other fish that

f0aac5a1-5d5b-4e52-b7a0-b85ba8c5cbfd-3
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.740
are swimming through the water
as well.

29f6938f-628a-4763-a6d3-bffe087b4291-0
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:21.915
Uh, once down into this city,
which is kind of like it's, it's

29f6938f-628a-4763-a6d3-bffe087b4291-1
00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:26.358
kind of like ruins because it's
not a completely built building.

29f6938f-628a-4763-a6d3-bffe087b4291-2
00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:30.254
There are columns. This
particular building that it took

29f6938f-628a-4763-a6d3-bffe087b4291-3
00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:32.100
them to, there are columns.

e1aa9954-5a1b-4aa0-8484-4310647eb524-0
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.960
It's uh.

9d88cab6-3548-43eb-ba62-bd816abe08ba-0
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.294
It's got in the center of. It
doesn't have a roof, it's it's

9d88cab6-3548-43eb-ba62-bd816abe08ba-1
00:17:39.294 --> 00:17:43.434
open air because the roof it
appears has come off, as are

9d88cab6-3548-43eb-ba62-bd816abe08ba-2
00:17:43.434 --> 00:17:47.360
some other parts of the
building, but in the center of

9d88cab6-3548-43eb-ba62-bd816abe08ba-3
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.000
the square or the columns in the
in the building on the floor is

9d88cab6-3548-43eb-ba62-bd816abe08ba-4
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.500
around.

c2f7f672-2eda-4c3a-b9a0-4793c0e0bfb1-0
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:59.960
Kind of statue, pedestal statue.
There's some drawings of.

4a2ae4a6-bc4a-465b-8917-545049735624-0
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.908
I guess the little boy and the
little girl that are actually on

4a2ae4a6-bc4a-465b-8917-545049735624-1
00:18:05.908 --> 00:18:09.905
the base of the pedestal and
then the center part of the

4a2ae4a6-bc4a-465b-8917-545049735624-2
00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:12.500
pedestal is kind of like a
seahorse.

979cf553-c936-4c3e-ad33-215fa7b98104-0
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.360
Or a sea lion.

4d8d752a-0b1f-4058-8ca2-840bb18e7819-0
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.330
No seahorse.

369cc542-8de8-4bf7-b4ce-806a1cfb41cb-0
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.074
It's got it looks like it might
have a couple of seahorses and

369cc542-8de8-4bf7-b4ce-806a1cfb41cb-1
00:18:23.074 --> 00:18:27.995
their backs are to each other so
that they form a pedestal, and

369cc542-8de8-4bf7-b4ce-806a1cfb41cb-2
00:18:27.995 --> 00:18:30.840
at the top it appears that there
is.

7ca94824-8bf2-4bf5-9c8a-115bbbf5eaab-0
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.056
It's almost kind of like an
oyster, but instead of a Pearl,

7ca94824-8bf2-4bf5-9c8a-115bbbf5eaab-1
00:18:40.056 --> 00:18:43.560
it has the yellow like another
yet the yellow stick.

3b50bfd2-618f-4bb1-b397-8f63d8444ff4-0
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.706
And then the purple bird is
still with them as well. The

3b50bfd2-618f-4bb1-b397-8f63d8444ff4-1
00:18:48.706 --> 00:18:52.277
Purple bird also has his gear.
He's got a little oxygen tank

3b50bfd2-618f-4bb1-b397-8f63d8444ff4-2
00:18:52.277 --> 00:18:56.024
on, and you can see some of the
sea plants and the sea life all

3b50bfd2-618f-4bb1-b397-8f63d8444ff4-3
00:18:56.024 --> 00:18:59.829
throughout the picture as well.
And the little girl picks up the

3b50bfd2-618f-4bb1-b397-8f63d8444ff4-4
00:18:59.829 --> 00:19:00.590
yellow stick.

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-0
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.386
And in the next frame you can
see she has placed the yellow

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-1
00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:12.233
stick along with the orange
stick from the old man, the red

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-2
00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:17.080
stick that she had and the
purple stick that the little boy

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-3
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.927
had in her sash. And she's
carrying them on her and they're

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-4
00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:27.096
swimming away onto the next spot
of the map. But behind them is

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-5
00:19:27.096 --> 00:19:32.024
the men with the body armor and
the man that was wearing the

f8652cf3-a7f6-4372-a847-67c614b6a0d9-6
00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:32.590
yellow.

df7a0798-681a-4b23-b199-ca15d2b2fdf5-0
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.160
And they're kind of charging
after them in the water.

d0c0f56f-e369-4106-93ef-a7253f788b07-0
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.593
Then we see them swim so that
they finally make it to land,

d0c0f56f-e369-4106-93ef-a7253f788b07-1
00:19:44.593 --> 00:19:46.760
and they come up from the water.

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-0
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:52.405
And they run onto the grass. Um,
this particular land has a

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-1
00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:57.423
little bit more vegetation. It
looks like it's got some palm

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-2
00:19:57.423 --> 00:20:01.947
trees, and so a lot more
greenery. So they come out of

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-3
00:20:01.947 --> 00:20:07.376
the water. The little girl hands
the little boy his purple stick,

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-4
00:20:07.376 --> 00:20:12.312
and you can then see them use
their sticks, the red and the

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-5
00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:17.659
purple stick, to create another
drawing. So there it it appears,

308b94a4-52cd-4869-ae93-9e5dd5b8694b-6
00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:19.140
if I had to guess.

772d6db4-eb56-4075-9a36-e5ec9e640f9f-0
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.394
They're going to possibly be
drawing an elephant, but we'll

772d6db4-eb56-4075-9a36-e5ec9e640f9f-1
00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:25.610
see. We'll see in the next page.

a3ab2980-4f01-487c-b266-5fc1a75ffefd-0
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.780
Boom, OK.

27ef9dcf-d505-4d05-ad6b-dc730203456e-0
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.500
Maybe I was wrong. I think it
actually might be more like a

27ef9dcf-d505-4d05-ad6b-dc730203456e-1
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.140
rhinoceros.

f5a9bcc9-a582-4af6-9204-6819548c1bd0-0
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.849
But it is kind of like a
rhinoceros type of animal and

f5a9bcc9-a582-4af6-9204-6819548c1bd0-1
00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:42.090
they also drew.

e19a6ac8-a763-44e7-a015-47e63855b2f6-0
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.690
Oh boy, they drew.

90733487-cd47-4801-a35e-233216eb50f5-0
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.630
A kind of canopy.

a19fb1cd-0660-4388-8ed6-e5e1d5241d79-0
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.137
That sits on the top back of the
rhinoceros for them to sit in so

a19fb1cd-0660-4388-8ed6-e5e1d5241d79-1
00:20:56.137 --> 00:21:01.189
that they're sheltered and they
sit on top of this rhinoceros

a19fb1cd-0660-4388-8ed6-e5e1d5241d79-2
00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:05.834
like creature as the rhinoceros
carries them through the

a19fb1cd-0660-4388-8ed6-e5e1d5241d79-3
00:21:05.834 --> 00:21:07.790
vegetation along a road.

b958d6fa-4879-48ec-a47e-ef1a72cd43f4-0
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.680
That leads to what appears to
be.

cb516cf4-6374-4cc9-bac7-46ef665ede0e-0
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.460
Another little city this now
this city is almost more like.

5d9cb6b3-ca76-43fd-9ff7-7813d50d357b-0
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.220
Like the pyramids, it's kind of
built more like a pyramid style,

5d9cb6b3-ca76-43fd-9ff7-7813d50d357b-1
00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.500
um, the architecture.

d1d38c0b-7e88-4742-a92a-8ab82fe51db7-0
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.390
I don't know if I said the.

8b088edb-7cc1-4d49-8b35-35a8a7f529ca-0
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.900
The style before was a little
bit more like the.

9c7dff8c-0dcf-454b-a2ac-f22c123d65af-0
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.090
Like the Greek or the Roman
columns.

0322a7ff-8ee6-4b96-8de7-f49b24f7ff46-0
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.610
And there's two statues that are
along the road.

aa5b4ec8-8194-4c54-afdb-2d6cceb5faf1-0
00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.690
That kind of let you know that
you're entering into this city.

ce274abd-d05b-4c58-b39a-908914c4c3cb-0
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:50.335
And the next scene you can kind
of see the at the edge. The city

ce274abd-d05b-4c58-b39a-908914c4c3cb-1
00:21:50.335 --> 00:21:53.200
kind of is on the edge of the.

36860ff6-187f-4f23-910a-ffe68067346d-0
00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.730
Of the island, and there is some
kind of a.

8a74e259-3589-4b7c-bd21-373a19532d2d-0
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.797
I guess it's like a hand bridge,
you know those really soft like

8a74e259-3589-4b7c-bd21-373a19532d2d-1
00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:13.659
suspension type bridges that
leads to another building that's

8a74e259-3589-4b7c-bd21-373a19532d2d-2
00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:17.110
kind of out in the middle of the
water and.

5ac222b3-c0ff-4852-8806-7afd7b3b5a45-0
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.730
So we're kind of just looking
down from that.

ee0b158b-ed0c-4ecb-ad58-1c68fc3f546c-0
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.786
All right. Now we've got a close
up of that, we'll call it

ee0b158b-ed0c-4ecb-ad58-1c68fc3f546c-1
00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:35.543
suspension bridge. I don't know
if that's the right word, but

ee0b158b-ed0c-4ecb-ad58-1c68fc3f546c-2
00:22:35.543 --> 00:22:39.993
it's a very soft bridge and
it's, it's old, it's worn. So

ee0b158b-ed0c-4ecb-ad58-1c68fc3f546c-3
00:22:39.993 --> 00:22:44.673
there's, you know, parts of it
that are kind of missing. But

ee0b158b-ed0c-4ecb-ad58-1c68fc3f546c-4
00:22:44.673 --> 00:22:49.506
the kids are running from the
edge of this little pyramid town

ee0b158b-ed0c-4ecb-ad58-1c68fc3f546c-5
00:22:49.506 --> 00:22:53.650
at the edge of that Cliff across
this little hand or.

9b038757-e353-44d8-9a02-ef075d829801-0
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.588
uh foot suspension bridge trying
to get to this building that is

9b038757-e353-44d8-9a02-ef075d829801-1
00:22:58.588 --> 00:23:02.310
in the center of the water and
at the top of the.

cbec0338-78fd-4806-8091-d07bc81c9646-0
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.095
Top of the building there's a
yellow glow. I don't know if

cbec0338-78fd-4806-8091-d07bc81c9646-1
00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:08.885
there's a person or something
waiting up there, but there's a

cbec0338-78fd-4806-8091-d07bc81c9646-2
00:23:08.885 --> 00:23:10.910
yellow glow at the very top of
the building.

af01c7d9-48c1-487a-a25b-8e0a9c8f99ca-0
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.650
All right, once.

369271d8-d0d4-46b9-8979-f249fee78ca8-0
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:23.258
Once they finally meet the get
to the top, you can see that

369271d8-d0d4-46b9-8979-f249fee78ca8-1
00:23:23.258 --> 00:23:26.760
they maybe it's supposed to be
green.

9f902e10-716b-418f-b2a7-1fe14a98525d-0
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.070
Looks like it, yeah. OK. Sorry,
I thought it was yellow.

38350917-903a-49a7-83d6-f18c43b79d79-0
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.962
Yeah, it it's kind of like a
yellow green. We'll go with the

38350917-903a-49a7-83d6-f18c43b79d79-1
00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:38.080
yellow green. So it appears that
they.

ca149f49-fe2e-4622-8266-8a1116b8e878-0
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:44.964
That might have a green stick
here. And again, the men with

ca149f49-fe2e-4622-8266-8a1116b8e878-1
00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:50.753
the body armor are right behind
them on their trail, walking

ca149f49-fe2e-4622-8266-8a1116b8e878-2
00:23:50.753 --> 00:23:54.550
this, this footbridge, this
footbridge.

07439863-83e5-480b-b27c-0009f2e1c46a-0
00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.415
But they grabbed the stick and
then they pull out their purple

07439863-83e5-480b-b27c-0009f2e1c46a-1
00:24:00.415 --> 00:24:03.840
and their red sticks and they
begin to draw.

4f09c93a-c89f-4e89-8baa-6903162222c7-0
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:09.274
Um, some some other items that
will hopefully help them escape

4f09c93a-c89f-4e89-8baa-6903162222c7-1
00:24:09.274 --> 00:24:12.040
these men that are wearing the
armor?

708c3d0c-8131-4b13-8c84-67d0a1686151-0
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.490
Umm.

152be7f6-7f5e-4503-b008-a38a002ea0e7-0
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.098
I guess I should have said if we
go back one, I could say that

152be7f6-7f5e-4503-b008-a38a002ea0e7-1
00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:25.230
the boy, the boy begins to draw
these.

033d4a98-0430-42ac-ae0a-665ebf35a428-0
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.897
Long Oval shapes, kind of like
the shape of a fan blade, and

033d4a98-0430-42ac-ae0a-665ebf35a428-1
00:24:31.897 --> 00:24:37.059
the girl is drawing a look what
appears to be a kind of a thin

033d4a98-0430-42ac-ae0a-665ebf35a428-2
00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:38.370
rectangular box.

acf55a86-c9e7-442a-976f-fbe68e516bfe-0
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.310
Um.

ad01ddfa-3649-485c-9285-d540014a4a4b-0
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.250
And then on the next scene we
see that the.

80a63294-4f7c-458a-82d6-0db9b7034644-0
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.496
The long ripped, the long
rectangular things the boy was

80a63294-4f7c-458a-82d6-0db9b7034644-1
00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:56.030
drawing were the wings for what
looks like.

a944a622-7041-4f16-994b-812545f21dd8-0
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.600
Is that like a dragonfly?

0567f149-b958-4c8f-8dd4-397dc8e80c51-0
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.403
Ohh yeah it I guess that
creature kind of appears to be

0567f149-b958-4c8f-8dd4-397dc8e80c51-1
00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:11.324
kind of like a dragonfly, but on
the bottom it has like little

0567f149-b958-4c8f-8dd4-397dc8e80c51-2
00:25:11.324 --> 00:25:14.989
legs as well and it's holding in
each.

bcce7d6e-7906-461e-8591-bb629210283a-0
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.023
Each set of legs I would it
looks like there's three on each

bcce7d6e-7906-461e-8591-bb629210283a-1
00:25:20.023 --> 00:25:21.540
side and it's holding.

a83ca8c1-2ebe-488a-8c93-66e50141686f-0
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.351
A rope and the rope leads down
to kind of like a a seat rope

a83ca8c1-2ebe-488a-8c93-66e50141686f-1
00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:32.483
that you would have. So that box
actually is like the seat. And

a83ca8c1-2ebe-488a-8c93-66e50141686f-2
00:25:32.483 --> 00:25:37.696
there's a rope on each side like
for a swing. And the little boy

a83ca8c1-2ebe-488a-8c93-66e50141686f-3
00:25:37.696 --> 00:25:42.828
and little girl and the purple
bird are sitting on the red seat

a83ca8c1-2ebe-488a-8c93-66e50141686f-4
00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:47.799
and the dragonfly is carrying
them away and they are just out

a83ca8c1-2ebe-488a-8c93-66e50141686f-5
00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:52.049
of the reach of the men with
wearing the body armor.

5856c9e3-3a5d-45d8-8103-ccfe52940cf8-0
00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.030
So the dragonfly.

15e79179-7e8e-4feb-b57e-c7b76fec0e0c-0
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.030
OK, the dragonfly takes them.

9948f945-715a-47a8-b648-72b03d00cdb8-0
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.820
To another building and this
building.

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-0
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:19.604
Building appears to be more like
it. It looks like it has some

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-1
00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:24.539
kind of a a Buddha of some sort
on the side. And the lanterns.

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-2
00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:29.395
There's a couple lanterns kind
of hanging from each corner of

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-3
00:26:29.395 --> 00:26:34.252
the building, and at the very
top there is what appears to be

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-4
00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:39.421
a green stick at the top of this
building. So the dragonfly takes

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-5
00:26:39.421 --> 00:26:44.435
the little boy and little girl
drops them off at the top of the

99ecccbb-6291-460e-b5c1-529459d7dc4e-6
00:26:44.435 --> 00:26:45.139
building.

9d619e25-5c2c-42ee-b1ce-a5691054f74b-0
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.561
The little girl secures the
stick and you can see in the

9d619e25-5c2c-42ee-b1ce-a5691054f74b-1
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:54.454
background the men in the armor
are now on these planes. There's

9d619e25-5c2c-42ee-b1ce-a5691054f74b-2
00:26:54.454 --> 00:26:58.520
these planes that look like
some, almost like an egg.

ec21c4ac-0946-4856-9c30-0a4e6a44104e-0
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.070
Like an egg shape that is
carrying.

d17bef37-5986-4fcb-8594-b7c3b9a6f61c-0
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.464
I don't know what they are. It's
like an egg on top of a boat. Or

d17bef37-5986-4fcb-8594-b7c3b9a6f61c-1
00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:14.955
like the egg is carrying the
boat and the on the boats are

d17bef37-5986-4fcb-8594-b7c3b9a6f61c-2
00:27:14.955 --> 00:27:15.310
these.

9b7c66e1-e22d-4e44-ab81-7782a6c10595-0
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.640
Men and body armor, but they are
going through the air. They're

9b7c66e1-e22d-4e44-ab81-7782a6c10595-1
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.940
not going through the water.

1d4250ae-85c6-4413-bd78-ee45753e230a-0
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.019
So once once they pick up the
green stick, they've completed

1d4250ae-85c6-4413-bd78-ee45753e230a-1
00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:31.653
the circle of all the different
colors. So the little girl has a

1d4250ae-85c6-4413-bd78-ee45753e230a-2
00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:33.080
red, orange, yellow.

69ca195c-e9ed-46f9-9765-f0bd92bf637d-0
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.230
Yellow green, green and purple.

33cc8504-bf92-47ee-9cdc-ff6b8744b431-0
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.504
Stick in each holder of the sash
and the little boy still has the

33cc8504-bf92-47ee-9cdc-ff6b8744b431-1
00:27:45.504 --> 00:27:48.860
picture and they still have the
bird with them as well.

9d12e45d-942e-4c3e-9a29-16546a37b45c-0
00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.640
So in the next frame we can see.

cacf4417-52a6-4e94-acf0-85213ddf685e-0
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.220
That two of these.

adf3e610-6803-44cc-b2d2-82754c110645-0
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.230
Two of these little.

a75b4ee5-16ff-4918-b553-07401fa2ad11-0
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.641
Boat planes have kind of caught
up and are hovering right above

a75b4ee5-16ff-4918-b553-07401fa2ad11-1
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:13.470
the top of this building.

5485b2b8-a8c6-4aec-9c31-d6cead54b4d7-0
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.760
And you can see the bird. The
Purple Bird has the sash with

5485b2b8-a8c6-4aec-9c31-d6cead54b4d7-1
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:25.145
all the colored sticks and he's
in the air and there is a man on

5485b2b8-a8c6-4aec-9c31-d6cead54b4d7-2
00:28:25.145 --> 00:28:25.560
each.

60a5e5e5-e886-4fd4-933d-02479e45aad3-0
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.321
Plane that is reaching out for
the bird. Trying to grab the

60a5e5e5-e886-4fd4-933d-02479e45aad3-1
00:28:32.321 --> 00:28:32.690
bird.

e9a0708f-3f7e-44a5-a2ea-caec54b76d00-0
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.361
And you can kind of see the kids
or feel fearful at the top of

e9a0708f-3f7e-44a5-a2ea-caec54b76d00-1
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:39.140
the building.

64c97e5f-c12b-4087-951c-1ab4bc3918e8-0
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.960
And then in the next frame.

6ca7165e-0a29-469a-979a-b3cdd28450ed-0
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:47.819
We don't see the kids, we don't
see the bird, we don't see the

6ca7165e-0a29-469a-979a-b3cdd28450ed-1
00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:50.290
sticks. We just see the three.

100e372c-808a-4307-b831-bda3aa1c0749-0
00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.140
Planes of the men in the body
armor.

ccd62e26-d04c-48a6-9c30-aa06ed18382e-0
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.900
But then we get to a page where
we can see.

ec492eeb-c9c6-4b1b-b450-533002180ef0-0
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:14.553
The bird that had the sash with
all the different sticks lined

ec492eeb-c9c6-4b1b-b450-533002180ef0-1
00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:20.645
up in the sash is is flying away
from that top of that building,

ec492eeb-c9c6-4b1b-b450-533002180ef0-2
00:29:20.645 --> 00:29:26.080
and as he does, the colors from
the sticks are creating a

ec492eeb-c9c6-4b1b-b450-533002180ef0-3
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.829
rainbow.

9f831ea5-05cd-4f7a-a3e3-87ef2d6bbc14-0
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:33.158
That runs from where the kids
are at the top of the building

9f831ea5-05cd-4f7a-a3e3-87ef2d6bbc14-1
00:29:33.158 --> 00:29:37.906
to where the bird is flying with
the sash. So it's kind of

9f831ea5-05cd-4f7a-a3e3-87ef2d6bbc14-2
00:29:37.906 --> 00:29:42.896
running across the sky and the
colors are coming out from the

9f831ea5-05cd-4f7a-a3e3-87ef2d6bbc14-3
00:29:42.896 --> 00:29:45.230
rainbow and the force of the.

ebe7c83f-175b-4b59-af27-484cf23260ae-0
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.160
Rainbow is blinding the men who
are wearing body armor in these

ebe7c83f-175b-4b59-af27-484cf23260ae-1
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.837
planes, so the color is so
forceful from the rainbow that

ebe7c83f-175b-4b59-af27-484cf23260ae-2
00:29:55.837 --> 00:30:00.675
they're the men are covering
their eyes and they're falling

ebe7c83f-175b-4b59-af27-484cf23260ae-3
00:30:00.675 --> 00:30:05.675
out of the planes and they're
trying to hold on because it is

ebe7c83f-175b-4b59-af27-484cf23260ae-4
00:30:05.675 --> 00:30:07.530
so bright and forceful.

a838b518-7276-4d7e-89c7-80a9f204e664-0
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:11.920
Um.

60bbd2fa-6ed3-4a14-8257-43e6e4bd84f4-0
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:20.046
Then you can see at this point,
from this perspective, we can

60bbd2fa-6ed3-4a14-8257-43e6e4bd84f4-1
00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:25.513
see where the rainbow begins
with the kids at the top of the

60bbd2fa-6ed3-4a14-8257-43e6e4bd84f4-2
00:30:25.513 --> 00:30:31.248
building, but the bird continues
to fly away and create an even

60bbd2fa-6ed3-4a14-8257-43e6e4bd84f4-3
00:30:31.248 --> 00:30:36.805
bigger rainbow. And he flies
over the bridge that we saw with

60bbd2fa-6ed3-4a14-8257-43e6e4bd84f4-4
00:30:36.805 --> 00:30:42.361
the Castle like City, and he
flies all the way above the boat

60bbd2fa-6ed3-4a14-8257-43e6e4bd84f4-5
00:30:42.361 --> 00:30:45.139
that had been carrying the man.

04169346-090c-45d2-9349-3050544881f7-0
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.210
In the orange robe, the older
man in the orange robe, and so

04169346-090c-45d2-9349-3050544881f7-1
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.540
the rainbow hits.

d91ad6cf-0c0f-4e77-827e-7eda125840c1-0
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.320
The rainbow hits the the boat.

adbde4ef-29e9-4de3-96b0-78a24f78aa7b-0
00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.783
And the man is rejoicing. The
man in the orange is rejoicing

adbde4ef-29e9-4de3-96b0-78a24f78aa7b-1
00:31:00.783 --> 00:31:05.417
as is, as are the people that
were wearing green. But all of

adbde4ef-29e9-4de3-96b0-78a24f78aa7b-2
00:31:05.417 --> 00:31:10.279
the men in the body armor again
are being blinded by the colors

adbde4ef-29e9-4de3-96b0-78a24f78aa7b-3
00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:14.837
and the forcefulness of the
colors of the rainbow, and they

adbde4ef-29e9-4de3-96b0-78a24f78aa7b-4
00:31:14.837 --> 00:31:18.560
are falling off of the ship over
into the water.

4f2aa46b-a3b7-4d6b-9148-e4181576f840-0
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:30.020
All right. And then finally in
this scene, we see a.

4f9cc31c-d0f5-43e9-855d-9bcfe4ce7577-0
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.480
We see a view of a.

074adaba-62d2-4414-af07-0ac42a525240-0
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.370
This is like the top of one of
the bridges, but it's.

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-0
00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:45.576
In this city that's kind of that
castle like city, and you can

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-1
00:31:45.576 --> 00:31:50.611
see it's very it's a lot more
colorful. There's a big rainbow

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-2
00:31:50.611 --> 00:31:55.240
in the sky that's that's kind of
going over the city and

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-3
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.869
protecting it. You see the
dragonfly, you see the purple

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-4
00:31:59.869 --> 00:32:04.499
bird, you see the purple
octopus, you see the rhinoceros

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-5
00:32:04.499 --> 00:32:09.209
and all the people who were
dressed in green, you kind of

ab71fbb6-d886-4b26-bfcc-7c09bf9804c3-6
00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:10.590
see them leading.

5816cb06-72b3-4247-ab8f-dff2c24cdcf6-0
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:15.700
They're back in their boats and
they're back guarding the city.

d305f272-d783-4b2b-a00d-22f0cf080bc8-0
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.498
And and we still see that one
boat that that they had the old

d305f272-d783-4b2b-a00d-22f0cf080bc8-1
00:32:22.498 --> 00:32:23.690
man on is now.

9034ee68-fc7a-439b-90a4-d225bea7f763-0
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.530
It's now being led by.

65dddf16-b343-4106-acb8-d0ad52d1ec0d-0
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.884
The men who were dressed in
green and the man is now riding

65dddf16-b343-4106-acb8-d0ad52d1ec0d-1
00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:37.373
the rhinoceros in front of the
little boy and little girl, so

65dddf16-b343-4106-acb8-d0ad52d1ec0d-2
00:32:37.373 --> 00:32:41.718
they're still under that red
canopy and in front of them is

65dddf16-b343-4106-acb8-d0ad52d1ec0d-3
00:32:41.718 --> 00:32:45.918
the man in the orange, and
they're waving to everybody in

65dddf16-b343-4106-acb8-d0ad52d1ec0d-4
00:32:45.918 --> 00:32:46.569
the city.

5241a0d8-bb17-41aa-b623-3cab675e155c-0
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.520
It's.

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-0
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.098
Then once they get to the rock,
they go back to the rock that's

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-1
00:32:57.098 --> 00:33:01.568
just outside of where that
tunnel led to, and the man is

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-2
00:33:01.568 --> 00:33:06.429
held. The older man is helping
the kids off of the rhinoceros

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-3
00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:11.056
and they come down to the rock.
You can also tell that the

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-4
00:33:11.056 --> 00:33:15.917
greenery that was on top of that
Cliff and that ledge now has

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-5
00:33:15.917 --> 00:33:20.936
pretty colorful flowers growing
on that greenery. You still see

f4825cfd-23a5-4bee-affb-a1003960c243-6
00:33:20.936 --> 00:33:21.250
the.

4ff1de0e-20cb-4d01-b0e9-df4e420f18f5-0
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:27.299
The rainbow in the background
and the sky. The octopus is down

4ff1de0e-20cb-4d01-b0e9-df4e420f18f5-1
00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:32.738
in the water, the dragonfly is
flying in the air. And the kids

4ff1de0e-20cb-4d01-b0e9-df4e420f18f5-2
00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:33.170
then.

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-0
00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:39.360
Um, the kids then go into
they're standing by the tunnel

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-1
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.390
door, the man. They still have
their purple bird with them, by

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-2
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:49.101
the way. The man pulls out his
orange stick and he draws a

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-3
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:54.290
crown for each of the children,
and he places the crown on their

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-4
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:59.001
heads and he waves. He thanks
them, and then he waved. The

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-5
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:03.791
kids waved goodbye to them, to
him, each one carrying their

df462d9d-203c-42c4-a167-990637b56d0b-6
00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:04.670
respective.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.600
Stick still.

bec69180-7d09-4a2e-b116-c9a90562fec0-0
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.750
And then as they exit back
through the wooden doors that

bec69180-7d09-4a2e-b116-c9a90562fec0-1
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.906
were under the tunnel where they
were sheltering while it was

bec69180-7d09-4a2e-b116-c9a90562fec0-2
00:34:16.906 --> 00:34:19.320
raining, you can see them look
out.

851d9e4d-7ae7-4814-b0bd-032a81e97fd3-0
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.437
On the other side of the tunnel
to see the cityscape and a

851d9e4d-7ae7-4814-b0bd-032a81e97fd3-1
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.470
really pretty beautiful rainbow.

4aa691d9-7ab9-44cd-849d-0ab82ca41231-0
00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.670
Over the city.

c1428336-c88a-4e9a-858a-e0f30d9ae123-0
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.190
And you can see the street
lights and all the greenery and

c1428336-c88a-4e9a-858a-e0f30d9ae123-1
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.730
it's everything has come back to
life. It's sunny and very

c1428336-c88a-4e9a-858a-e0f30d9ae123-2
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.170
colorful now. #END_quest

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:45.800
Yeah, that was the last page of
the story. OK, good.

42eab9d6-b0db-4da5-b69e-22fde769f959-0
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:52.208
OK, so now let's move on to the
next item. OK, another as you

42eab9d6-b0db-4da5-b69e-22fde769f959-1
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:57.130
can tell, the styles are similar
to those two stories.

d8a66012-60fc-4d0d-b3d0-263d8ecb802e-0
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.200
Again, whenever you're ready.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:01.610
OK.

c856535e-e4a1-426b-9961-df0f0e207869-0
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:08.568
#START_journey Alright, so this
book is, it looks like it is a

c856535e-e4a1-426b-9961-df0f0e207869-1
00:35:08.568 --> 00:35:13.641
similar story of the two kids we
see the same little boy and

c856535e-e4a1-426b-9961-df0f0e207869-2
00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:18.880
there's the same little girl.
This time they are. They're also

c856535e-e4a1-426b-9961-df0f0e207869-3
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.460
in a a city center.

e8ad04e6-08d8-44ae-8fb7-a60fcbf50994-0
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.380
I'm trying to think of this
style.

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-0
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.301
It's the buildings and in the
background is kind of a brownish

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-1
00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:35.578
Gray. This one is titled for
Josephine, so maybe we'll find

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-2
00:35:35.578 --> 00:35:39.856
out who Josephine is. But we're
looking at them on a street

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-3
00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:44.276
level and you can see the boy
holding his purple stick. He is

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-4
00:35:44.276 --> 00:35:48.625
by a mailbox. You can see some
other kids in the background,

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-5
00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:52.760
skateboarding, riding their
bikes high fiving each other.

90130d34-50d5-4619-96a5-c96ff36eff26-6
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.610
You see the old style street
lamps, but you also see.

d6be391c-103b-42cf-812d-83fb4b39bb49-0
00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.753
Regular Street lights and signs
arrow signs you see street signs

d6be391c-103b-42cf-812d-83fb4b39bb49-1
00:36:01.753 --> 00:36:06.281
that have the name of the
streets, you see a fire hydrant

d6be391c-103b-42cf-812d-83fb4b39bb49-2
00:36:06.281 --> 00:36:07.530
and then on the.

132ba63f-f3eb-4a96-9532-7000aecaa0e1-0
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.140
Other.

287f6eb0-054d-40b4-9060-dae56e7baa5f-0
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.916
Picture on the second page you
see the little girl, kind of

287f6eb0-054d-40b4-9060-dae56e7baa5f-1
00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:20.453
sad. She's sitting on the top of
the step outside of the

287f6eb0-054d-40b4-9060-dae56e7baa5f-2
00:36:20.453 --> 00:36:21.170
building.

0e3397da-5390-44ad-a2d9-34fd26ab9410-0
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.760
And you would assume that that
building is where she lives

0e3397da-5390-44ad-a2d9-34fd26ab9410-1
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.463
because you can kind of see the
inside of the rooms. You can see

0e3397da-5390-44ad-a2d9-34fd26ab9410-2
00:36:29.463 --> 00:36:33.222
there's a stairway when you walk
in, a place to hang your hat and

0e3397da-5390-44ad-a2d9-34fd26ab9410-3
00:36:33.222 --> 00:36:36.526
your coat with a mirror. Then
there is like a little hall

0e3397da-5390-44ad-a2d9-34fd26ab9410-4
00:36:36.526 --> 00:36:40.000
table with pictures and a light
and a plant. There's a woman

0e3397da-5390-44ad-a2d9-34fd26ab9410-5
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.450
behind that that's cooking in
the kitchen.

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-0
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.808
And then upstairs you can see a
man at a computer with

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-1
00:36:47.808 --> 00:36:52.507
bookshelves and looks like maybe
some certificates on the wall.

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-2
00:36:52.507 --> 00:36:57.353
And in the room behind that, you
can see a girl who appears to be

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-3
00:36:57.353 --> 00:37:01.611
on her phone or playing with
something while she's laying

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-4
00:37:01.611 --> 00:37:05.797
down on the couch. But the
little girl is sitting at the

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-5
00:37:05.797 --> 00:37:10.349
top of the outside porch, front
step, and she is kind of sad,

9620540e-92ca-4dc3-adf3-739ed4371144-6
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:13.580
kind of hugging her knees and
looking down.

393b63f8-bea7-417e-be4b-eefe686af189-0
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.184
And it looks like she has a red
scooter that's kind of parked

393b63f8-bea7-417e-be4b-eefe686af189-1
00:37:17.184 --> 00:37:19.410
right at the bottom of the step
as well.

df73170c-5ae3-4e37-a05f-017b76686909-0
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.010
Keep them in this one today.

d5dbc455-3432-4c4a-9703-aa952e485669-0
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.570
OK.

1929a379-bed1-4072-8fee-5181e748e51b-0
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.410
So.

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-0
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.985
And the next page we see the
little girl in the kitchen with

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-1
00:37:36.985 --> 00:37:40.950
her mom. She has her scooter,
her red scooter in the kitchen

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-2
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.850
and her mom is cooking and on
the phone and she's on an old

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-3
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.815
style phone. So Umm when that
had a has a cord. So the phone

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-4
00:37:48.815 --> 00:37:53.040
is actually like on the wall. I
don't think it's a Rotary phone,

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-5
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.135
but the phone is attached to the
wall and there's a long cord.

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-6
00:37:57.135 --> 00:38:01.360
The mom is talking on the phone
while she's cooking and then the

d8b5a646-ae8e-4fbf-aa8c-388af95c8e83-7
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.050
little girl decides to go.

0c7c63a5-001d-49bc-86a0-e4fbd6562604-0
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.833
She she now has a red kite and
she takes the kite upstairs to

0c7c63a5-001d-49bc-86a0-e4fbd6562604-1
00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:12.523
where her dad is and her dad is
sitting at a desk on a computer

0c7c63a5-001d-49bc-86a0-e4fbd6562604-2
00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:17.140
and he's busy with what appears
to be working on the computer.

53c2c97f-9580-44db-bd77-2bef03b52a82-0
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:25.700
Then she goes and she she takes
a red ball up to.

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-0
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.450
The girl who is laying on the
couch on her phone, I would

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-1
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.677
assume that's maybe her older
sister. And all of them are just

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-2
00:38:35.677 --> 00:38:40.037
kind of busy and preoccupied in
their own activities, not really

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-3
00:38:40.037 --> 00:38:44.062
paying attention to her and not
really able to give her any

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-4
00:38:44.062 --> 00:38:48.221
attention or be able to play
with her. So in then in our next

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-5
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:52.314
frame, we see her back in her
room and she's just sitting on

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-6
00:38:52.314 --> 00:38:56.204
her bed looking very upset, her
head down, frowning, arms

33477c70-8cbd-4adb-a2cb-5c38d1d1c381-7
00:38:56.204 --> 00:38:57.010
crossed and.

cfeddf41-1d8a-4eb4-9297-e00d783e8f42-0
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.356
We see she's got a map of the
world above her bed. She's got a

cfeddf41-1d8a-4eb4-9297-e00d783e8f42-1
00:39:01.356 --> 00:39:04.659
little sailboats on her
comforter. She has a dresser

cfeddf41-1d8a-4eb4-9297-e00d783e8f42-2
00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:08.335
with little trash can and a
light picture on the wall. And

cfeddf41-1d8a-4eb4-9297-e00d783e8f42-3
00:39:08.335 --> 00:39:12.262
then she does have a cute little
Kitty cat that's curled up on

cfeddf41-1d8a-4eb4-9297-e00d783e8f42-4
00:39:12.262 --> 00:39:13.820
the floor on some papers.

d2543664-8655-4039-b843-15a3cac5d035-0
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:24.383
Then we see the Kitty cat get up
and head out the door outside of

d2543664-8655-4039-b843-15a3cac5d035-1
00:39:24.383 --> 00:39:28.000
out her bedroom door and when he
gets up.

66219349-ffe3-4f45-8553-4d10717beb48-0
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:33.160
She sees that the cat was laying
on her red stick.

d9d53968-f556-4ce5-81e9-9a68cf0a975f-0
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:37.830
So she looks over at the stick.
She picks it up.

70921b72-4465-4310-a52b-d9ae9bac6eb0-0
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:44.420
And she begins to draw on her
wall a door.

1aa04955-7b31-48e7-8f8e-f86ed0505cfb-0
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.844
An arched door, and once she's
finished drawing the arched

1aa04955-7b31-48e7-8f8e-f86ed0505cfb-1
00:39:49.844 --> 00:39:54.606
door, she opens the doors and
she goes through the door into

1aa04955-7b31-48e7-8f8e-f86ed0505cfb-2
00:39:54.606 --> 00:39:57.650
where the to see where the door
leads.

7cc79de2-37c3-4e6d-9506-847b9543f211-0
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:05.280
On the other side of the door,
she comes out.

b5a825de-74ff-4528-93e5-9391f98e46c4-0
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.840
It's not a tunnel, it's like the
door just opens into.

9e8a8fc8-af94-4b05-a4df-7cdad6afc285-0
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.300
Umm.

0bf5947b-eebc-4342-a0da-31e89a1b6f32-0
00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.061
It's kind of like a forest. The
door is actually like a part of

0bf5947b-eebc-4342-a0da-31e89a1b6f32-1
00:40:20.061 --> 00:40:21.890
the base of a tree trunk.

66dbe0ce-a90b-4c1c-8e63-c128c741e178-0
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:27.936
And it's very pretty. It's kind
of all, it's all green tones,

66dbe0ce-a90b-4c1c-8e63-c128c741e178-1
00:40:27.936 --> 00:40:32.110
and it looks like there is a
small little Creek that winds

66dbe0ce-a90b-4c1c-8e63-c128c741e178-2
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:36.071
through the land, through the
trees. But there are also

66dbe0ce-a90b-4c1c-8e63-c128c741e178-3
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:40.528
strings of little lights running
through the trees, as well as

66dbe0ce-a90b-4c1c-8e63-c128c741e178-4
00:40:40.528 --> 00:40:43.500
different lanterns. They're kind
of like.

8703e3f0-1b29-45ca-a89d-fff225dd44b4-0
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.980
Like Asian lanterns that are
hanging.

84e17697-90a7-4117-8f65-6653bc54e84b-0
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:52.570
And it's very pretty and very it
looks very peaceful and calm.

59219f89-729c-4205-91e2-6ab35560f0aa-0
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.749
And she is. She's still standing
at the door when she walks

59219f89-729c-4205-91e2-6ab35560f0aa-1
00:40:56.749 --> 00:41:00.276
through holding her red stick,
and she's looking out into this

59219f89-729c-4205-91e2-6ab35560f0aa-2
00:41:00.276 --> 00:41:01.340
little forest area.

e0fa65d0-1e70-4b6d-95f8-cc712d8bfc41-0
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.571
So she walks through the forest.
She does find a little, very

e0fa65d0-1e70-4b6d-95f8-cc712d8bfc41-1
00:41:10.571 --> 00:41:15.442
small little wooden dock that
extends into the water, and she

e0fa65d0-1e70-4b6d-95f8-cc712d8bfc41-2
00:41:15.442 --> 00:41:20.471
goes to the edge of the dock and
looks down into the water. She

e0fa65d0-1e70-4b6d-95f8-cc712d8bfc41-3
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:24.871
then begins to draw at the
bottom of the dock above the

e0fa65d0-1e70-4b6d-95f8-cc712d8bfc41-4
00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:29.900
water, a red boat. And so she's
drawing this red boat, and once

e0fa65d0-1e70-4b6d-95f8-cc712d8bfc41-5
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.750
she is completed drawing the red
boat, she hops.

2837d072-4b59-4112-af50-78f4cad7ed10-0
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.650
Into the boat.

7452528a-5654-4383-bf65-df8dec8e1f17-0
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.470
And starts to sail away from the
dock.

23078c5a-5767-4501-8ec4-5222733f5b81-0
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.680
And she takes.

7a349ef7-439f-4a60-b323-94b4a799ef34-0
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:50.020
The boat down the Little Creek
or canal and it leads.

3d068a90-3b52-443a-b0c5-947238b96ea5-0
00:41:53.700 --> 00:42:00.110
Back over to this castle. Kind
of castle like city.

c8109399-c18b-4743-a297-571ec0b9193c-0
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.950
And we see this big castle like
city. It is primarily of a.

c9aa6d95-ebce-43dd-ae0b-d48a98239d0a-0
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:12.551
This is primarily green tones to
the coloring of everything.

c9aa6d95-ebce-43dd-ae0b-d48a98239d0a-1
00:42:12.551 --> 00:42:17.651
There are some gold domes on top
of some of the buildings. Some

c9aa6d95-ebce-43dd-ae0b-d48a98239d0a-2
00:42:17.651 --> 00:42:22.432
of the buildings have little
flags. You can see some people

c9aa6d95-ebce-43dd-ae0b-d48a98239d0a-3
00:42:22.432 --> 00:42:23.150
that are.

70f3fe40-7470-4bcc-ac6b-d9aa7e0327d6-0
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:30.247
Guarding on the top you can see
some people in boats going along

70f3fe40-7470-4bcc-ac6b-d9aa7e0327d6-1
00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:35.700
the waterways and the bridge,
but not too too populated.

47fae438-d84d-4826-bc22-e08ba7f2d38e-0
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:47.805
All right, so the little girl
has now entered into the city

47fae438-d84d-4826-bc22-e08ba7f2d38e-1
00:42:47.805 --> 00:42:51.210
and instead of roadways, they
are.

5920b0a4-1a38-4443-a8b8-64936e752bd4-0
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.057
Waterways kind of similar to
Venice. And it looks like there

5920b0a4-1a38-4443-a8b8-64936e752bd4-1
00:42:57.057 --> 00:43:00.728
is like a couple of gondola like
boats that are on these

5920b0a4-1a38-4443-a8b8-64936e752bd4-2
00:43:00.728 --> 00:43:04.527
waterways. And so the little
girl's in her red boat and as

5920b0a4-1a38-4443-a8b8-64936e752bd4-3
00:43:04.527 --> 00:43:08.326
she enters back into the city,
all the men who are wearing

5920b0a4-1a38-4443-a8b8-64936e752bd4-4
00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:12.189
green are waving at her and
welcoming her back to the city.

03d92c70-13fa-4bca-87fe-f932ae746550-0
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.270
Let's see. And she gets to the
end of.

705b26f3-cd5a-47db-9a42-1e84edb0046f-0
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:30.606
The one waterway and it is, it's
a drop, so the water just pours

705b26f3-cd5a-47db-9a42-1e84edb0046f-1
00:43:30.606 --> 00:43:31.110
down.

61be033f-9ace-46d6-9c90-5410466c2c45-0
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.820
Into.

b910d328-015d-4e67-b3d2-45ff56dcf360-0
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.906
I guess the main body of water
and so she gets to the end of

b910d328-015d-4e67-b3d2-45ff56dcf360-1
00:43:38.906 --> 00:43:43.181
the waterway and her red boat
and she goes overboard and as

b910d328-015d-4e67-b3d2-45ff56dcf360-2
00:43:43.181 --> 00:43:43.680
she is.

4ab9999b-ef9c-44c8-b046-b59ba6337324-0
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:49.292
Going down, she pulls out her
red stick and she begins to draw

4ab9999b-ef9c-44c8-b046-b59ba6337324-1
00:43:49.292 --> 00:43:51.400
what appears to be a circle.

fcc793b5-4d5d-418a-aa67-a2cc43781ec7-0
00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:00.354
And the circle ends up a like a
hot air balloon, like a red hot

fcc793b5-4d5d-418a-aa67-a2cc43781ec7-1
00:44:00.354 --> 00:44:04.970
air balloon. So she hops into
the hot air balloon and she

fcc793b5-4d5d-418a-aa67-a2cc43781ec7-2
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.666
waves goodbye to the men in
green, and the hot air balloon

fcc793b5-4d5d-418a-aa67-a2cc43781ec7-3
00:44:09.666 --> 00:44:10.940
carries her off.

666898e9-670d-4e31-b4b0-0359f6daff9a-0
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:17.482
Um, we see in the next picture
that she's... well We don't see

666898e9-670d-4e31-b4b0-0359f6daff9a-1
00:44:17.482 --> 00:44:23.397
her. We see above the clouds. We
can see the little purple bird.

666898e9-670d-4e31-b4b0-0359f6daff9a-2
00:44:23.397 --> 00:44:24.580
We can see a.

7fa88697-9ad0-4636-9fe2-9536e17c40c5-0
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.990
We can see some of those little.

1e7e8e03-b871-446e-8dec-e4e4669b0f5b-0
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:35.186
Flying boats. They're like boat
planes, but there's also a

1e7e8e03-b871-446e-8dec-e4e4669b0f5b-1
00:44:35.186 --> 00:44:35.780
bigger.

c23a98d0-2f2c-4974-a29c-00e684550072-0
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.932
Contraption, and I don't know,
this is hard to explain. It's

c23a98d0-2f2c-4974-a29c-00e684550072-1
00:44:40.932 --> 00:44:45.035
kind of like a boat because it
has like a water wheel that you

c23a98d0-2f2c-4974-a29c-00e684550072-2
00:44:45.035 --> 00:44:49.073
would find on like a bigger boat
or a ship, but it's a little

c23a98d0-2f2c-4974-a29c-00e684550072-3
00:44:49.073 --> 00:44:52.330
more industrialized because it
looks like it has.

a698d3f0-39aa-463f-bcbf-cd8e0d4285fe-0
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:57.972
I don't know if it's got it's
got some kind of industrialized

a698d3f0-39aa-463f-bcbf-cd8e0d4285fe-1
00:44:57.972 --> 00:45:02.427
component to it, like a a
machine would on the top part of

a698d3f0-39aa-463f-bcbf-cd8e0d4285fe-2
00:45:02.427 --> 00:45:04.240
it and you do see a man.

ec8098af-94a5-4b68-b89d-3cbfa955b00d-0
00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:09.444
Kind of kind of yellow, golden
in color, holding something up

ec8098af-94a5-4b68-b89d-3cbfa955b00d-1
00:45:09.444 --> 00:45:13.150
in his hands, but I'm not quite
sure what that is.

8c67dd07-0e33-44f6-bb02-62b41ed514ad-0
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.870
The little girl is flying high
above the clouds. And she.

93cfc4e5-23da-45b6-9457-c636c47237dd-0
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.640
Looks down and she can see.

46cc6e40-bf7a-43aa-b832-d5d4e406cf6b-0
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.410
Umm.

f37cda41-43c7-4671-b718-fcdd983b9270-0
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:31.150
This man, this kind of yellow
man is.

7fd19fa8-18e4-4f20-90a5-ed9f36e5b3a4-0
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.630
It looks like he's got a gun,
and he is.

04c15ac2-c80f-48d3-9a78-2961140b2ff4-0
00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:39.200
No, maybe it's not a gun.

6ded1e61-ccae-42a2-be88-95b24193aefb-0
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.954
I think he's pointing. He does
have a couple of people who are

6ded1e61-ccae-42a2-be88-95b24193aefb-1
00:45:44.954 --> 00:45:49.868
dressed in body armor and he's
pointing to them to capture the

6ded1e61-ccae-42a2-be88-95b24193aefb-2
00:45:49.868 --> 00:45:52.520
purple bird. And so there is
one.

dedfea75-9845-46a4-8358-f1a645b4db0f-0
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.825
Man who is basically off of the
plane and he's got a net trying

dedfea75-9845-46a4-8358-f1a645b4db0f-1
00:45:57.825 --> 00:46:02.358
to capture this purple bird, and
then he's being held onto the

dedfea75-9845-46a4-8358-f1a645b4db0f-2
00:46:02.358 --> 00:46:06.676
plane by a second man who is
being held back by a third man

dedfea75-9845-46a4-8358-f1a645b4db0f-3
00:46:06.676 --> 00:46:10.129
so that they don't fall off of
this this plane.

89e90d4f-e430-430e-ad9a-a5e1b608dcaf-0
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.358
And ohh, now we can tell the
thing that the man was holding

89e90d4f-e430-430e-ad9a-a5e1b608dcaf-1
00:46:17.358 --> 00:46:21.524
was some kind of a there's a
cage because unfortunately they

89e90d4f-e430-430e-ad9a-a5e1b608dcaf-2
00:46:21.524 --> 00:46:23.710
have now gotten the purple bird.

cc0d3614-d327-43cb-a48d-5dcb66a960ea-0
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.065
And the little girl still in her
red air hot air balloon and

cc0d3614-d327-43cb-a48d-5dcb66a960ea-1
00:46:29.065 --> 00:46:30.760
she's overlooking this.

e2765ab7-f942-4f15-9f07-a5a3acf14333-0
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:38.058
Um, where they have got the
purple bird in a cage and it

e2765ab7-f942-4f15-9f07-a5a3acf14333-1
00:46:38.058 --> 00:46:44.302
looks like on the backside of
this contraption is a gold thing

e2765ab7-f942-4f15-9f07-a5a3acf14333-2
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:48.960
with Umm, it's got like a gold
bird on it and.

fc3769f2-08da-4d98-acb6-726f20a59f6b-0
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:56.313
I I'm still not 100% sure of
what it is. Maybe we'll find

fc3769f2-08da-4d98-acb6-726f20a59f6b-1
00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:59.060
that out in the next in the next
page.

3ffabe19-e865-4861-ae99-e949a468bae9-0
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.592
But we can see now that we're
closer to this big machine like

3ffabe19-e865-4861-ae99-e949a468bae9-1
00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:13.062
ship, we can see that it is
metal. It is. It's almost like a

3ffabe19-e865-4861-ae99-e949a468bae9-2
00:47:13.062 --> 00:47:16.799
factory. So it's got like
mechanical parts, like a

3ffabe19-e865-4861-ae99-e949a468bae9-3
00:47:16.799 --> 00:47:20.170
factory, but it's built to
propel in the air.

d0806b96-b93b-409f-8a49-b26e52962bcc-0
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.729
So little girl hops out. She
lands on one of the landings of

d0806b96-b93b-409f-8a49-b26e52962bcc-1
00:47:26.729 --> 00:47:27.150
this.

077c2ce9-6f99-4cb8-aa77-6d67931a235a-0
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.727
I'm going to call the
contraption because I don't know

077c2ce9-6f99-4cb8-aa77-6d67931a235a-1
00:47:30.727 --> 00:47:34.134
what it is, but she exits out of
the hot air balloon and she is

077c2ce9-6f99-4cb8-aa77-6d67931a235a-2
00:47:34.134 --> 00:47:34.560
running.

8652d91b-0350-4a1a-8df5-868ed473ff86-0
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:41.090
Along into a doorway that leads
to one of the towers.

5e0aec1c-87a8-4661-8997-ef361aa72a7e-0
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:47.169
And she's got her red stick. And
once she gets over there, she

5e0aec1c-87a8-4661-8997-ef361aa72a7e-1
00:47:47.169 --> 00:47:52.170
climbs the ladder and she climbs
up to this little golden.

d9e19294-c489-45a4-9547-451636957346-0
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.860
Umm.

9f447784-8511-4e9b-bfb8-0ee085721996-0
00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:00.578
I don't know if it's a statue or
or topped building and on the

9f447784-8511-4e9b-bfb8-0ee085721996-1
00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:05.615
inside of that there are two men
in armor and they are guarding

9f447784-8511-4e9b-bfb8-0ee085721996-2
00:48:05.615 --> 00:48:10.573
this purple bird that is in a
gold cage and she is climbing up

9f447784-8511-4e9b-bfb8-0ee085721996-3
00:48:10.573 --> 00:48:15.060
to hopefully try to rescue this
cute little purple bird.

3f951463-3739-4981-a53c-5621055b61ca-0
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.121
And of course she does, because
she's successful. And she she

3f951463-3739-4981-a53c-5621055b61ca-1
00:48:23.121 --> 00:48:28.218
grabs the cage that has the bird
in it and she still has her red

3f951463-3739-4981-a53c-5621055b61ca-2
00:48:28.218 --> 00:48:33.001
stick, and she runs away and you
see the two men in the body

3f951463-3739-4981-a53c-5621055b61ca-3
00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:36.530
armor and they have, they have
their little.

d6418a28-c533-4ac1-80fd-1eae27d2da6b-0
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.735
Spears. Maybe it wasn't dagger.
I was thinking of a spear

d6418a28-c533-4ac1-80fd-1eae27d2da6b-1
00:48:40.735 --> 00:48:43.690
earlier. They're Spears. They
have these two long Spears.

4bd7d234-48cb-48b8-882a-98458e608eb4-0
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.370
And they are.

6fd461e5-e733-4644-8015-a0c4d73e1639-0
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:52.312
Telling her to stop and then
trying to reach after her, but

6fd461e5-e733-4644-8015-a0c4d73e1639-1
00:48:52.312 --> 00:48:55.000
she is determined and she runs.

1ccd58fa-170b-448a-b6ee-1093135fafa4-0
00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:01.635
And she gets to the edge and she
opens the cage and she lets the

1ccd58fa-170b-448a-b6ee-1093135fafa4-1
00:49:01.635 --> 00:49:06.990
bird fly away. She frees the
bird. But you can see all these

1ccd58fa-170b-448a-b6ee-1093135fafa4-2
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:12.082
men in body armor that are
inside of this factory machine

1ccd58fa-170b-448a-b6ee-1093135fafa4-3
00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:15.330
start running with Spears after
her.

51545b3e-d253-4c7a-98ad-7c7f6b80636c-0
00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:25.707
And because she had to let the
cage door open and let the bird

51545b3e-d253-4c7a-98ad-7c7f6b80636c-1
00:49:25.707 --> 00:49:30.728
go, she set her red crayon down
next to the cage. And

51545b3e-d253-4c7a-98ad-7c7f6b80636c-2
00:49:30.728 --> 00:49:36.400
unfortunately, it looks like a
couple of the men in the body

51545b3e-d253-4c7a-98ad-7c7f6b80636c-3
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.770
armor grab the arm of the little
girl and the.

9f4cb885-ec66-4eeb-80fe-444f960e16b7-0
00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.390
Umm.

0190d334-54cd-4444-a5dd-0fac3733d1fb-0
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.625
Man that was in the yellow is
standing at the edge with his

0190d334-54cd-4444-a5dd-0fac3733d1fb-1
00:49:47.625 --> 00:49:52.151
hand on his hip and his other
arm outstretched, and you can

0190d334-54cd-4444-a5dd-0fac3733d1fb-2
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:56.753
see the red stick dropped down
and fall from the ledge where

0190d334-54cd-4444-a5dd-0fac3733d1fb-3
00:49:56.753 --> 00:49:58.789
where they're all standing.

be7bef21-6508-4d62-a312-562ec4faea78-0
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.240
In the next page we see.

f9f4ea14-a906-4f08-ba3d-2b7162ad66fe-0
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:09.642
We see the girl, she's in a
she's in a different, she's like

f9f4ea14-a906-4f08-ba3d-2b7162ad66fe-1
00:50:09.642 --> 00:50:13.765
in a hanging cage. It's
different than the one that the

f9f4ea14-a906-4f08-ba3d-2b7162ad66fe-2
00:50:13.765 --> 00:50:18.258
bird was in. But she's in a
hanging cage and at the top it's

f9f4ea14-a906-4f08-ba3d-2b7162ad66fe-3
00:50:18.258 --> 00:50:20.320
hanging off of this factory.

8ffb7edf-4a02-48e0-b40e-f61961749dca-0
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.018
boat Contraption airplane
contraption because it it has a

8ffb7edf-4a02-48e0-b40e-f61961749dca-1
00:50:25.018 --> 00:50:29.285
wheel like a boat. It has a
propeller like a plane, but it's

8ffb7edf-4a02-48e0-b40e-f61961749dca-2
00:50:29.285 --> 00:50:33.763
almost like a factory. But above
she's hanging like by a chain.

8ffb7edf-4a02-48e0-b40e-f61961749dca-3
00:50:33.763 --> 00:50:38.031
And there's two men that are
kind of turning this wheel like

8ffb7edf-4a02-48e0-b40e-f61961749dca-4
00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:41.390
you would see on a boat, like a
captains wheel.

f43af26d-0e83-40e2-b1d5-450585a9e36a-0
00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:48.994
And they're turning it, and she
is in this kind of cage kind of

f43af26d-0e83-40e2-b1d5-450585a9e36a-1
00:50:48.994 --> 00:50:52.800
hanging, and she's looking down
below her.

00140f40-53db-4b5a-9718-89fbb81a8598-0
00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:01.783
And then we see the bird save
the day. He is flying back to

00140f40-53db-4b5a-9718-89fbb81a8598-1
00:51:01.783 --> 00:51:07.174
the little girl and he has got
her red stick in his beak and he

00140f40-53db-4b5a-9718-89fbb81a8598-2
00:51:07.174 --> 00:51:12.565
is flying to her. She is jumping
for joy with her arms open and

00140f40-53db-4b5a-9718-89fbb81a8598-3
00:51:12.565 --> 00:51:13.660
outstretched.

08813eeb-b2a7-4ee6-8b15-d9cd5cb07a5f-0
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:20.901
And the bird gives her back the
red stick and he sits on her

08813eeb-b2a7-4ee6-8b15-d9cd5cb07a5f-1
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:24.950
shoulder and she begins to draw
a box.

c8b074f0-f056-4028-b79a-398b8ebd176f-0
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:34.306
And the box that she's drawing
ends up kind of like a magic

c8b074f0-f056-4028-b79a-398b8ebd176f-1
00:51:34.306 --> 00:51:40.162
carpet. So she sits on this red
carpet and she is flying through

c8b074f0-f056-4028-b79a-398b8ebd176f-2
00:51:40.162 --> 00:51:45.388
the air. Following this,
following the Purple Bird she is

c8b074f0-f056-4028-b79a-398b8ebd176f-3
00:51:45.388 --> 00:51:46.830
now flying over.

faa90dcd-0d9d-4848-b333-476241bbc881-0
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:55.449
Possibly the same city. She
might be flying over the city

faa90dcd-0d9d-4848-b333-476241bbc881-1
00:51:55.449 --> 00:51:56.060
right now.

db763de2-a71f-45a5-b06c-add567049138-0
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.180
And we see in the next picture.

e121c60e-0c9a-4334-8ce9-dd84316af421-0
00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:09.776
That it's kind of dusk and
turning to night time, the the

e121c60e-0c9a-4334-8ce9-dd84316af421-1
00:52:09.776 --> 00:52:14.859
sky has gotten darker. It's now
a bit more of like a purple and

e121c60e-0c9a-4334-8ce9-dd84316af421-2
00:52:14.859 --> 00:52:19.545
then closer to the horizon it's
a little bit more pink and

e121c60e-0c9a-4334-8ce9-dd84316af421-3
00:52:19.545 --> 00:52:24.707
there's little stars in the sky.
And the little girl is still on

e121c60e-0c9a-4334-8ce9-dd84316af421-4
00:52:24.707 --> 00:52:29.393
her red carpet, traveling over
this city and following the

e121c60e-0c9a-4334-8ce9-dd84316af421-5
00:52:29.393 --> 00:52:33.920
bird. And on the next page we
see the bird head down to.

c2a45b9f-212d-43fb-b218-6fa61d793c37-0
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.850
A part of land where there is
like a single palm tree.

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-0
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.767
And so they land on the ground.
The little girl gets off of the

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-1
00:52:47.767 --> 00:52:52.444
carpet. She does have her red
stick. And at the base of this

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-2
00:52:52.444 --> 00:52:57.505
palm tree is a purple arch door.
And the the bird is sitting next

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-3
00:52:57.505 --> 00:53:02.028
to the palm tree. And so the
little girl gets down and she

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-4
00:53:02.028 --> 00:53:06.782
opens the purple door and the
bird flies through and then she

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-5
00:53:06.782 --> 00:53:11.306
goes behind the bird with her
red stick through the purple

f4bb6f4b-b825-47ab-95ec-ef250ac69679-6
00:53:11.306 --> 00:53:11.690
door.

c45b079d-65df-42d6-9927-3adc996c4326-0
00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.400
And on the other side of the
door.

4c635193-f5cc-403d-adbb-98bd5d52dc8d-0
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.030
Is.

d87a8e61-6dd4-48fd-9775-259951e057c2-0
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:23.411
It leads it, actually. The
doorway leads to the mailbox

d87a8e61-6dd4-48fd-9775-259951e057c2-1
00:53:23.411 --> 00:53:26.914
that we saw in the very first
picture of that was on the

d87a8e61-6dd4-48fd-9775-259951e057c2-2
00:53:26.914 --> 00:53:30.539
street that the little boy was
standing there. There was a

d87a8e61-6dd4-48fd-9775-259951e057c2-3
00:53:30.539 --> 00:53:31.400
mailbox there.

ef87eb18-05bf-408d-89e2-1439d66285b7-0
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:38.244
And through that mailbox comes
the purple bird and the little

ef87eb18-05bf-408d-89e2-1439d66285b7-1
00:53:38.244 --> 00:53:43.699
girl carrying her red stick. And
the little boy sees them, and he

ef87eb18-05bf-408d-89e2-1439d66285b7-2
00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:47.750
is running towards them with his
arms wide open.

7b3685e9-7378-4e70-90e6-c04388c3f94c-0
00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.132
Very happy to see them. He's got
his purple stick. The little

7b3685e9-7378-4e70-90e6-c04388c3f94c-1
00:53:53.132 --> 00:53:57.645
bird perches on the stick in his
hand and he helps the little

7b3685e9-7378-4e70-90e6-c04388c3f94c-2
00:53:57.645 --> 00:54:01.940
girl up and she draws a circle
and the boy draws a circle.

fba121f6-ab55-48b4-8b90-f81a29d18975-0
00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:10.913
And together they they drew a
bicycle. So one wheel is purple,

fba121f6-ab55-48b4-8b90-f81a29d18975-1
00:54:10.913 --> 00:54:17.145
one wheel is red, and it's a
double seater bicycle and little

fba121f6-ab55-48b4-8b90-f81a29d18975-2
00:54:17.145 --> 00:54:17.950
girl is.

8e962753-22c7-460d-9d2d-644aae4e6fbf-0
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:22.736
At the front of the bike and she
is pointing forward and the bird

8e962753-22c7-460d-9d2d-644aae4e6fbf-1
00:54:22.736 --> 00:54:26.390
is following behind them as they
peddle away. #END_journey

b92f7a5e-1702-44f8-834d-1fa7fa8c22a5-0
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:32.062
All right. That was great. That
was that. Was that it? Yeah,

b92f7a5e-1702-44f8-834d-1fa7fa8c22a5-1
00:54:32.062 --> 00:54:34.170
that was OK. Good story. OK.

154b8f36-0ed9-47c7-b0c2-a0d88a82dce6-0
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.150
OK then.

8d5cc50d-2faf-4114-bc8c-0df20d79e976-0
00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.730
We have another story you.

386e8a0b-64e7-4db8-800a-597b5c6387d0-0
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:48.402
My head remembered. Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah. Whenever you're

386e8a0b-64e7-4db8-800a-597b5c6387d0-1
00:54:48.402 --> 00:54:52.970
ready, take 10 between 10 to 15
minutes to OK.

e675725f-1be8-4243-b462-1bb9a864fe08-0
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.210
That's fine, um.

d3de72b6-eaf6-4efa-9903-442836d76a22-0
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.245
All right, I got to switch
modes. Are these all the same

d3de72b6-eaf6-4efa-9903-442836d76a22-1
00:55:01.245 --> 00:55:04.709
artists or is it different
artists for different types?

d3de72b6-eaf6-4efa-9903-442836d76a22-2
00:55:04.709 --> 00:55:08.482
Before those two stories, they
are from the same artist from

d3de72b6-eaf6-4efa-9903-442836d76a22-3
00:55:08.482 --> 00:55:12.070
the same series, and right now
we're looking at parts of.

739de857-f696-455b-aa06-2c8aaf5b5536-0
00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:18.025
Of different book, so they're OK
from different books. They just

739de857-f696-455b-aa06-2c8aaf5b5536-1
00:55:18.025 --> 00:55:19.430
all have this like.

fa074eda-ba44-4d31-b51d-6e895d7e79a4-0
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:24.668
Variations of real animals and
variations of real planes or

fa074eda-ba44-4d31-b51d-6e895d7e79a4-1
00:55:24.668 --> 00:55:28.741
real, you know, they're all. So
it's like it's I wonder if it's

fa074eda-ba44-4d31-b51d-6e895d7e79a4-2
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:29.760
the same person.

43e4bf12-9305-4284-84ee-7734d47b19d5-0
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.190
#START_arrival_1 OK, so in this
we see a series of.

1d8fb86f-3617-4021-8ae8-1fb956e4afdb-0
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:38.460
Um.

e8f2ac0a-1ffc-4792-aeb4-5bc99ea2f496-0
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.280
Pictures they they're kind of.

c62bd6a9-c65e-4256-8655-ab772be77c80-0
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:51.914
Like a hand drawn or like a
charcoal type of a picture, but

c62bd6a9-c65e-4256-8655-ab772be77c80-1
00:55:51.914 --> 00:55:56.854
they're brown, they're brown in
tone. And in the first picture

c62bd6a9-c65e-4256-8655-ab772be77c80-2
00:55:56.854 --> 00:56:01.559
we see an actual picture in A
frame of a man, a woman and a

c62bd6a9-c65e-4256-8655-ab772be77c80-3
00:56:01.559 --> 00:56:02.500
little girl.

2a4bdcc3-6e26-49c4-a71f-963b31b9c944-0
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:08.480
We then see a hand reach to pick
up the picture frame.

69d7f8f9-accb-497f-bd40-8df0f8391e66-0
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:15.941
Then you see two hands and you
can see like a white cloth. They

69d7f8f9-accb-497f-bd40-8df0f8391e66-1
00:56:15.941 --> 00:56:21.776
place the picture in a white
cloth and fold it over to cover

69d7f8f9-accb-497f-bd40-8df0f8391e66-2
00:56:21.776 --> 00:56:27.801
and protect the picture. Then
you see the two hands, take some

69d7f8f9-accb-497f-bd40-8df0f8391e66-3
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:32.680
string and tie it around the
cloth in the picture.

06ec83f6-a9fc-4e07-af36-749b8b4a0386-0
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:38.725
Um, kind of tie it into a bow
like you would around the

06ec83f6-a9fc-4e07-af36-749b8b4a0386-1
00:56:38.725 --> 00:56:43.520
present, and then they put it in
a suitcase, they.

835eda35-9969-4e18-8630-3c2d708d6c11-0
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.808
Seal the suitcase up and rest
both of their hands on the top

835eda35-9969-4e18-8630-3c2d708d6c11-1
00:56:49.808 --> 00:56:51.070
of the suitcase.

7545f82a-df22-49a3-9c85-f9b8d040e56d-0
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.210
Um, then we see a.

e3ce9d8a-54c2-4948-91ee-b0d7aec12e79-0
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:07.037
Paper. It's kind of like a paper
crane, kind of like origami. We

e3ce9d8a-54c2-4948-91ee-b0d7aec12e79-1
00:57:07.037 --> 00:57:08.890
see a picture of a.

59df4ab1-212c-446b-af46-bee43455b313-0
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.500
Of a clock um.

dc0fcb5d-917c-4b92-86ef-4f65577a36f7-0
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.895
I don't know why I'm drawing a
blank on some of these things.

dc0fcb5d-917c-4b92-86ef-4f65577a36f7-1
00:57:17.895 --> 00:57:22.958
It's a clock that's in. It's not
a wall clock. It's like a little

dc0fcb5d-917c-4b92-86ef-4f65577a36f7-2
00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:26.410
desk clock and it's in like a
little wooden.

c85d38ab-305d-49c3-b64d-d5a91eab8741-0
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.450
Not a box, but it's a decorative
wooden.

0c71a059-f47e-4762-8b35-6e99461ad88f-0
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.574
Clock that you would see like on
a desk or a shelf. We see a

0c71a059-f47e-4762-8b35-6e99461ad88f-1
00:57:36.574 --> 00:57:41.343
picture of a hat, a black, kind
of like a black top hat, hanging

0c71a059-f47e-4762-8b35-6e99461ad88f-2
00:57:41.343 --> 00:57:42.150
as well as.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.440
Umm.

0402cb0a-6897-4303-b9d8-957bfab245a0-0
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:49.920
It's a piece of fabric. I don't
know if it's a towel or a shirt.

479d8f36-1bf2-40db-aacf-9a7a77fa9ddd-0
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:55.459
We see a pot and a spoon, a
cooking pot and a spoon. We see

479d8f36-1bf2-40db-aacf-9a7a77fa9ddd-1
00:57:55.459 --> 00:58:00.450
a hand drawn picture from a
child of a mom and a dad and the

479d8f36-1bf2-40db-aacf-9a7a77fa9ddd-2
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:05.769
child and a little bird with the
sun, maybe some birds flying in

479d8f36-1bf2-40db-aacf-9a7a77fa9ddd-3
00:58:05.769 --> 00:58:10.923
the background. We see a cracked
porcelain teapot that has hot

479d8f36-1bf2-40db-aacf-9a7a77fa9ddd-4
00:58:10.923 --> 00:58:15.669
water in it because we see the
steam coming out. We see a

479d8f36-1bf2-40db-aacf-9a7a77fa9ddd-5
00:58:15.669 --> 00:58:20.170
picture of a coffee pot. We see
a picture of a teacup.

ba9184d1-ca95-464f-8718-7af5d583e3fd-0
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.380
Or coffee cup.

79bcf1a1-e55b-4891-b0d6-18150ecf5b20-0
00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:27.118
With some kind of liquid in
there. And then it appears that

79bcf1a1-e55b-4891-b0d6-18150ecf5b20-1
00:58:27.118 --> 00:58:32.180
there is maybe some money, some
bills of money next to that.

36748aaa-98ab-4a5f-bbc6-da188bf02b10-0
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:38.458
We see the opening of the
luggage with the wrapped picture

36748aaa-98ab-4a5f-bbc6-da188bf02b10-1
00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:44.441
frame that's sitting on the top,
and then we see the picture kind

36748aaa-98ab-4a5f-bbc6-da188bf02b10-2
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:50.242
of up close of the husband and
the wife and the child, and then

36748aaa-98ab-4a5f-bbc6-da188bf02b10-3
00:58:50.242 --> 00:58:52.690
in the next picture we see.

fb218ba1-01a3-4fa3-8f31-381914c79827-0
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.700
what appears to be the man and
the woman.

167e0e29-69eb-4b69-aa0f-8d8a499e9a47-0
00:58:56.990 --> 00:59:00.650
Looking kind of sad and.

1aa95f56-3353-430a-82ba-734ece834a1f-0
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.152
Worried. And they have closed up
the suitcase and they're holding

1aa95f56-3353-430a-82ba-734ece834a1f-1
00:59:08.152 --> 00:59:13.624
each other's hands on the top of
the suitcase and they're kind of

1aa95f56-3353-430a-82ba-734ece834a1f-2
00:59:13.624 --> 00:59:17.190
looking down at the hands, at
their hands.

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-0
00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:24.052
And they're in, oh, I guess I
should say they're in a kitchen

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-1
00:59:24.052 --> 00:59:27.803
and the the luggage is on a
table. There's three chairs

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-2
00:59:27.803 --> 00:59:31.822
surrounding the table and you
see the items that you saw in

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-3
00:59:31.822 --> 00:59:36.042
the previous picture. So you see
the little origami crane on a

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-4
00:59:36.042 --> 00:59:40.195
shelf. You see the clock on a
shelf. You see the picture, the

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-5
00:59:40.195 --> 00:59:44.348
hand drawn picture hanging in
the background, the hat hanging

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-6
00:59:44.348 --> 00:59:48.702
in the background. On the stove,
you can see the pot and you see

ea1934ac-c17d-44af-89c5-6227eb493320-7
00:59:48.702 --> 00:59:48.969
the.

192e14e1-8806-43f1-85a7-544cd5762b98-0
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:54.741
Teacup or the coffee cup with
the kettle and the money on the

192e14e1-8806-43f1-85a7-544cd5762b98-1
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:57.360
table in front of the luggage.

7909ab6a-5976-4d2a-aa18-a14839d338ee-0
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.298
Then we see a picture of a
little girl sleeping with her,

7909ab6a-5976-4d2a-aa18-a14839d338ee-1
01:00:05.298 --> 01:00:09.979
kind of covering her face with
her covers, and then she lifts

7909ab6a-5976-4d2a-aa18-a14839d338ee-2
01:00:09.979 --> 01:00:14.584
her head. You can kind of she
peers out from the covers, she

7909ab6a-5976-4d2a-aa18-a14839d338ee-3
01:00:14.584 --> 01:00:16.999
sits up, she yawns, and she Umm.

b2d735e8-3e35-437a-9c4c-66434734b74d-0
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:25.320
Kind of rubs her eyes. She then
comes down to the kitchen.

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-0
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.819
And she has a bowl and a spoon
where she's having breakfast.

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-1
01:00:30.819 --> 01:00:35.708
And while she's eating she looks
over and she sees the luggage.

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-2
01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:40.749
She sees the luggage over on the
side. Then we see the man put on

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-3
01:00:40.749 --> 01:00:45.485
his coat and his hat. We see the
woman take the fabric or the

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-4
01:00:45.485 --> 01:00:50.068
scarf, cover her head, and they
put a coat and a hat on the

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-5
01:00:50.068 --> 01:00:55.033
little girl as well. She puts on
her rain boots and she picks up

3750a205-8005-4d94-9a40-c08250d673ee-6
01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:55.950
the luggage.

cfc95c10-ab11-4e3a-a523-afaa7d084bc9-0
01:00:56.290 --> 01:01:01.608
And the father takes the luggage
from her, and you see them exit

cfc95c10-ab11-4e3a-a523-afaa7d084bc9-1
01:01:01.608 --> 01:01:06.436
out of a doorway, down a few
steps, and then head off. The

cfc95c10-ab11-4e3a-a523-afaa7d084bc9-2
01:01:06.436 --> 01:01:11.428
husband, the wife, the daughter,
and the man is carrying the

cfc95c10-ab11-4e3a-a523-afaa7d084bc9-3
01:01:11.428 --> 01:01:16.011
luggage, but you see a
reflection. There's a shadow and

cfc95c10-ab11-4e3a-a523-afaa7d084bc9-4
01:01:16.011 --> 01:01:20.920
a reflection of a spiked tail
against the building of which

cfc95c10-ab11-4e3a-a523-afaa7d084bc9-5
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.330
they.

1480da15-770b-4167-b7dc-0532484eb3a2-0
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.990
Were just in that they exited. 

310e7f63-ce65-44b8-91b7-5e5ebe112986-0
01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.372
{EXTRA CONTENT FROM CHAPTER 1 We
can see that that building was

310e7f63-ce65-44b8-91b7-5e5ebe112986-1
01:01:35.372 --> 01:01:40.327
kind of like a townhouse or row
house style of housing. We can

310e7f63-ce65-44b8-91b7-5e5ebe112986-2
01:01:40.327 --> 01:01:44.888
now see that there are several
connected and we can see a

310e7f63-ce65-44b8-91b7-5e5ebe112986-3
01:01:44.888 --> 01:01:49.606
bigger reflected. We can see a
bigger shadow and the actual

310e7f63-ce65-44b8-91b7-5e5ebe112986-4
01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:54.639
tail is much bigger, this spiked
tail, but we're still not able

310e7f63-ce65-44b8-91b7-5e5ebe112986-5
01:01:54.639 --> 01:01:55.190
to see.

0e2bef7e-6b48-4816-9cb5-eb6c901d91d0-0
01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:02.050
The creature just the tail is a
lot bigger. In the second photo

0e2bef7e-6b48-4816-9cb5-eb6c901d91d0-1
01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:07.779
we see each of these little
townhouses row houses has

0e2bef7e-6b48-4816-9cb5-eb6c901d91d0-2
01:02:07.779 --> 01:02:14.675
chimneys and we can see rows of
these houses and this spike tail

0e2bef7e-6b48-4816-9cb5-eb6c901d91d0-3
01:02:14.675 --> 01:02:21.360
kind of weaves over and through
each row of the houses. So the

0e2bef7e-6b48-4816-9cb5-eb6c901d91d0-4
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.710
tail is quite long and it just
it winds.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.810
Through each row of the houses.}

0f6ddc54-af26-4908-9a78-81141cfa420b-0
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.135
Then we see the little girl look
up, kind of frightened and sad.

0f6ddc54-af26-4908-9a78-81141cfa420b-1
01:02:36.135 --> 01:02:39.725
She's holding her dad's hand.
She then looks down, kind of

0f6ddc54-af26-4908-9a78-81141cfa420b-2
01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:42.220
sad, and then she looked
straight ahead.

5b72c7a1-0a3b-421e-8be1-ae4d5e022061-0
01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.647
And we can see people with their
luggage waiting along the side

5b72c7a1-0a3b-421e-8be1-ae4d5e022061-1
01:02:48.647 --> 01:02:53.730
with the train. There's like a
locomotive train that's coming

5b72c7a1-0a3b-421e-8be1-ae4d5e022061-2
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:56.190
in and we see the little girl.

b526dd66-9519-4ed3-af6a-61f2a43a7dfa-0
01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.343
Worried, and the father puts his
hand on her shoulder, and he

b526dd66-9519-4ed3-af6a-61f2a43a7dfa-1
01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:06.977
lifts up his hat and on his
head, under his hat is the

b526dd66-9519-4ed3-af6a-61f2a43a7dfa-2
01:03:06.977 --> 01:03:10.010
origami crane, and he gives
little.

c1112894-2896-4bea-ad89-44df4afc03d1-0
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.930
Origami bird to the little girl.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.410
And she holds it and looks at it
in her hand. And then she hugs

f0c9c912-e306-410a-a485-6605358ce917-1
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.100
the father.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:26.032
And then she is continuing to
hold the the little bird and we

85d6e178-eadc-4a6a-8c7d-5f56de740c1b-1
01:03:26.032 --> 01:03:30.293
see the mother with her scarf on
and she's got like a

85d6e178-eadc-4a6a-8c7d-5f56de740c1b-2
01:03:30.293 --> 01:03:34.870
handkerchief and she's crying

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.566
We can see her then hug the
father, and the father whispers

e864c4df-6764-47b4-92bc-22db2652806f-1
01:03:41.566 --> 01:03:46.270
something into her ear. And then
we see the Father board the

e864c4df-6764-47b4-92bc-22db2652806f-2
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:51.050
train with his luggage and then
he grabs the hand of the wife

e864c4df-6764-47b4-92bc-22db2652806f-3
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:53.210
and the hand of little girl.

5bdb6d14-aed3-49be-aa43-bbd50b49b3e7-0
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:56.680
To say goodbye and then.

470ccb4b-507f-4b72-ba5a-a677876b9278-0
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:03.435
Their hands let go and the train
starts off and carries him away

470ccb4b-507f-4b72-ba5a-a677876b9278-1
01:04:03.435 --> 01:04:04.860
into the distance.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:13.077
{EXTRA CONTENT FROM CHAPTER 1
Then we see the little girl and

451d8ec9-f4e0-4015-a6e1-5cc452e42c50-1
01:04:13.077 --> 01:04:16.881
the mother head back along the

winding through the street,

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.719
through one of the rows of
these.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:29.334
Row homes or townhomes and you
can see the waves of the spike

a1fe3e96-2a0b-4fb3-9c6a-eb94b76ec35f-1

going over and curving through

the sky over these homes.}

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:44.302
All right. That was that part of
the story. OK, why don't we take

fa536754-f301-42c9-a1ae-c0a61eba24ed-1
01:04:44.302 --> 01:04:46.220
the 10 minute break, OK?

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.000
OK.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.509
So this is a complex scene.
Please take between three and

29e7b026-159b-4d73-8c70-fe4368675437-1
01:04:56.509 --> 01:05:01.980
five minutes to describe the
scene in as much detail as you

29e7b026-159b-4d73-8c70-fe4368675437-2
01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.710

So in this scene, which is a

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.160
where's Waldo? We've got.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:12.750
Huh.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:19.146
I'm bad. Today we have one of
those scene like scene cards

a435846a-1ca3-4cb7-ae4a-7522697d9e7a-1
01:05:19.146 --> 01:05:24.135
that they use where they go
lights, camera, action and it's

a435846a-1ca3-4cb7-ae4a-7522697d9e7a-2
01:05:24.135 --> 01:05:29.623
black and white and they clip it
up and then put it down to start

a435846a-1ca3-4cb7-ae4a-7522697d9e7a-3
01:05:29.623 --> 01:05:34.530
the scene and it's called
dinosaurs, spacemen, and ghouls.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:42.022
And it has like, a little bit of
a description of this particular

55e26479-ca1f-4a20-a141-f0e0cdd693e7-1
01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:43.490
where's Waldo story?

39bd5a7c-44ca-4ffe-8250-d36acb3edf4f-0
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.960
So in the first page.

cfcb30cc-3bae-421d-959c-b1ada0b60413-0
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.670
Which I can't tell her the page
is supposed to be.

01c16566-afb5-49b0-b188-f553f4fb55e0-0
01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:54.720
Like connecting.

e0851270-57f4-43bd-9ee5-4c1d99f915b1-0
01:05:56.190 --> 01:06:01.155
Perhaps of the same page. {OK,
scan those pictures. So we OK,

e0851270-57f4-43bd-9ee5-4c1d99f915b1-1
01:06:01.155 --> 01:06:06.120
what happened? And the other
OK.} So in this scene we see, we

e0851270-57f4-43bd-9ee5-4c1d99f915b1-2
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.204
see a lot going on in the
Where's Waldo? It's very

e0851270-57f4-43bd-9ee5-4c1d99f915b1-3
01:06:10.204 --> 01:06:15.170
colorful. Lots of people on the
left side of the page we see.

bf641d0c-352c-402a-ba28-80abd6aadbf2-0
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.190
What appears to be.

cf50a592-4d9c-41d6-84a3-2ec240ecb746-0
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:26.562
Some kind of almost like volcano
type of a structure. It's kind

cf50a592-4d9c-41d6-84a3-2ec240ecb746-1
01:06:26.562 --> 01:06:31.695
of orange in the background, but
it does have a a peak that has

cf50a592-4d9c-41d6-84a3-2ec240ecb746-2
01:06:31.695 --> 01:06:36.827
like yellow and white coming out
of it. And there's almost like

cf50a592-4d9c-41d6-84a3-2ec240ecb746-3
01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:41.879
Cavemen at the top of that. But
then all over the side of this

cf50a592-4d9c-41d6-84a3-2ec240ecb746-4
01:06:41.879 --> 01:06:46.691
volcano there's lots of Cavemen
and then there appear to be

cf50a592-4d9c-41d6-84a3-2ec240ecb746-5
01:06:46.691 --> 01:06:50.140
dinosaurs kind of lounging
around as well.

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-0
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:55.395
Um, I'm not very good with my
types of dinosaurs, but we've

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-1
01:06:55.395 --> 01:07:00.404
got them green, we've got them
red, blue, pink. They seem to be

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-2
01:07:00.404 --> 01:07:04.708
happy and playful. They're
smiling. They are lounging.

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-3
01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:09.795
One's laying on his back. While
a caveman is like, tickling him.

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-4
01:07:09.795 --> 01:07:14.490
One is kind of sticking his
tongue out and waving his hands

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-5
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:19.421
next to his ears, playing with
the others. So lots of Cavemen,

8ba86e9d-a9df-4a2f-9ddf-4de25d573425-6
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:20.829
lots of dinosaurs.

6e73da03-28d1-4375-81eb-72797179b54e-0
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:23.220
On the other side of the.

4a01e55c-32fa-488e-9d2d-c51ce390c784-0
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:31.934
Of the volcano and what's kind
of on the right side is a scene.

4a01e55c-32fa-488e-9d2d-c51ce390c784-1
01:07:31.934 --> 01:07:34.260
It looks like this is.

937bdfa9-021c-42fe-b0a7-dc1a50ad2759-0
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:39.403
Uh, again, a movie. So it's
almost like it's a set. And

937bdfa9-021c-42fe-b0a7-dc1a50ad2759-1
01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:40.100
there is.

5a4c33e5-3e66-406b-aed5-63f8f9eb4e25-0
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.620
Like a a scene background that
they that there are men.

c884546e-1b40-4fb0-8ea5-f40f254d8f34-0
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:54.330
Um, kind of putting together and
behind this, this background you

c884546e-1b40-4fb0-8ea5-f40f254d8f34-1
01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:56.980
see ladders and all kinds of.

a2386a34-c341-4a18-a811-2a752f809182-0
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:05.183
Uh, ropes hanging. And I forget
what those are called too. But

a2386a34-c341-4a18-a811-2a752f809182-1
01:08:05.183 --> 01:08:10.454
you can see them kind of working
on putting this background

a2386a34-c341-4a18-a811-2a752f809182-2
01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:16.076
together, and they are. There's
a man who's painted most of the

a2386a34-c341-4a18-a811-2a752f809182-3
01:08:16.076 --> 01:08:21.697
background. It's actually being
painted blue, and then it's got

a2386a34-c341-4a18-a811-2a752f809182-4
01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:24.860
spacemen and spaceships as well
as.

21388159-48ce-4b5a-9b85-ce2d8220f89e-0
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.651
I don't know what those are.
They're these little green,

21388159-48ce-4b5a-9b85-ce2d8220f89e-1
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:34.664
little green men. Maybe those
are the ghouls, I don't know.

21388159-48ce-4b5a-9b85-ce2d8220f89e-2
01:08:34.664 --> 01:08:38.342
But there's a man on a ladder
and he's almost finished

21388159-48ce-4b5a-9b85-ce2d8220f89e-3
01:08:38.342 --> 01:08:42.221
painting this background. You
can also see that there are

21388159-48ce-4b5a-9b85-ce2d8220f89e-4
01:08:42.221 --> 01:08:46.568
camera lights above the volcano
as well as above this background

21388159-48ce-4b5a-9b85-ce2d8220f89e-5
01:08:46.568 --> 01:08:46.970
scene.

1d4d2f28-bd61-43ee-b7b6-5797cb989060-0
01:08:48.610 --> 01:08:55.344
And then on the on the bottom of
the pages, you can see that

1d4d2f28-bd61-43ee-b7b6-5797cb989060-1
01:08:55.344 --> 01:09:01.858
there are smaller sets. So
there's three smaller sets. One

1d4d2f28-bd61-43ee-b7b6-5797cb989060-2
01:09:01.858 --> 01:09:05.060
set is. It looks like it's a.

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-0
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.840
Costume area. You can see
several chairs along a vanity

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-1
01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.914
with three different mirrors and
there's three different people

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-2
01:09:15.914 --> 01:09:20.275
sitting in the chairs and
someone is doing their hair.

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-3
01:09:20.275 --> 01:09:25.429
There's also 3 doors for kind of
for wardrobe, for changing. You

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-4
01:09:25.429 --> 01:09:30.583
can see a spaceman is coming out
of one, a dinosaur's going into

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-5
01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:35.262
another. You can see racks of
clothing and lots of workers

a1bb4bdb-1f63-48d9-8f44-9bc45c58365d-6
01:09:35.262 --> 01:09:36.610
kind of prepping.

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-0
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:41.432
The caveman and the dinosaurs,
the spacemen and all the actors

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-1
01:09:41.432 --> 01:09:46.066
for the scene, the middle set is
painted blue. It's night time.

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-2
01:09:46.066 --> 01:09:50.484
You can see that there are some
trees. There is kind of some

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-3
01:09:50.484 --> 01:09:54.611
like they're not arched, but
they're kind of like church

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-4
01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:58.884
style windows that I guess
they're kind of arched. They're

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-5
01:09:58.884 --> 01:10:03.084
kind of pointed and they are
black, but there are sets of

d3367831-fbc1-44ea-a970-416fa469da64-6
01:10:03.084 --> 01:10:07.139
eyes on the other side. So you
see these sets of white.

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-0
01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:11.825
Eyes, sets of green eyes, sets
of red eyes. And then there's

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-1
01:10:11.825 --> 01:10:16.591
actors and directors and just
costume people, people that work

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-2
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:20.828
on the set that are kind of
surrounding this particular

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-3
01:10:20.828 --> 01:10:25.671
scene set. They also have lights
and cameras, but there's a big

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-4
01:10:25.671 --> 01:10:30.135
ice cream cone kind of on a
pedestal in front of these two

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-5
01:10:30.135 --> 01:10:34.599
windows, like a vanilla ice
cream cone, like a soft serve.

fa9886c0-7fd8-4e1e-b57e-52c679f86ff5-6
01:10:34.599 --> 01:10:37.550
That sounds really good right
now and.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:43.079
And the third scene we see a set
that is a kind of like a

5c05a6a7-c9ba-4bd6-bd82-5b1243430f25-1
01:10:43.079 --> 01:10:48.311
cafeteria. It's got some
pictures of of pie on the wall

5c05a6a7-c9ba-4bd6-bd82-5b1243430f25-2
01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:53.544
like pie ice cream. We can see
women and men dressed in

5c05a6a7-c9ba-4bd6-bd82-5b1243430f25-3
01:10:53.544 --> 01:10:58.963
waitress style clothing, pink
with white aprons and white

5c05a6a7-c9ba-4bd6-bd82-5b1243430f25-4
01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:04.663
hats, men dressed with chef hats
and white coats and they're

5c05a6a7-c9ba-4bd6-bd82-5b1243430f25-5
01:11:04.663 --> 01:11:07.280
behind a buffet style glass.

c5c2f464-8e50-4d0e-880e-fc41120f56be-0
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:08.860
Partition.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.558
And they're serving food and
then at the end there's a woman

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-1
01:11:14.558 --> 01:11:18.852
who is at a cash register that's
ringing people. So you've got

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-2
01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:23.010
and you've also got some tables.
You have diners, people are

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-3
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:27.237
dining. So they go through kind
of like cafeteria style. They

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-4
01:11:27.237 --> 01:11:31.668
get what they want, they pay for
it and then they go sit at the,

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-5
01:11:31.668 --> 01:11:35.758
Umm, the tables. So I would
imagine that's kind of like the

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-6
01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:40.120
little lunch, dinner, breakfast
spot while they're on set. It's

f3aae5b1-734a-4d89-8d48-80af75704e5b-7
01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:40.530
a lot.

e52b7e8d-c91f-410b-be36-b3d1a0e045f5-0
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.722
It's just a lot going on. Yeah,
that's good, yeah.

e52b7e8d-c91f-410b-be36-b3d1a0e045f5-1

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:51.510
And then we're gonna move on to
another similar picture.

492ee140-2ded-4ded-a9ad-5d6cafa1f58d-0
01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:01.130
Oh wow. OK, a lot going on.
#START_wild_west All right, so

492ee140-2ded-4ded-a9ad-5d6cafa1f58d-1
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:05.950
this is this looks like it's
another scene for for where's

492ee140-2ded-4ded-a9ad-5d6cafa1f58d-2
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:11.015
Waldo. This one also has one of
the movie little movie cards.

492ee140-2ded-4ded-a9ad-5d6cafa1f58d-3
01:12:11.015 --> 01:12:15.998
I'm going to have to look that
up. The black and white movie

492ee140-2ded-4ded-a9ad-5d6cafa1f58d-4
01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:20.409
card. This one's called the Wild
Wild West and it is.

53e047f3-4a61-45c7-8fd9-4b72d11842f3-0
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.390
Kind of it kind of reminds me
of.

e17f24e6-2ecc-4bd1-9e37-fef59482dd3c-0
01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:34.970
It's it's like a little city
town center and used to have.

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-0
01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:41.744
Like everything kind of next to
each other old style. So there's

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-1
01:12:41.744 --> 01:12:46.843
a general store, there's a
saloon, there's a hotel, there's

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-2
01:12:46.843 --> 01:12:51.007
a jail and a lot of the
buildings have are multi

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-3
01:12:51.007 --> 01:12:56.106
stories. And the second story
has like a little balcony, so

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-4
01:12:56.106 --> 01:13:01.120
like on the saloon the first,
the first level has a little

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-5
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.965
balcony or like a little porch
and then there's a like a

6dac0c05-9174-4eec-9c2c-33e7d606df95-6
01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:06.560
canopy.

d01a79d7-1b93-44fb-8691-4707acb239b1-0
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:11.290
or partition that comes out for
a balcony to be on the top level

d01a79d7-1b93-44fb-8691-4707acb239b1-1
01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:15.521
of that as well, and there's
almost, there's one on almost

d01a79d7-1b93-44fb-8691-4707acb239b1-2
01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:19.967
every building and there are
people everywhere, so let's see.

d01a79d7-1b93-44fb-8691-4707acb239b1-3
01:13:19.967 --> 01:13:22.190
In the first picture we've got.

8192e6cd-f062-41b7-b5e3-366294884eaa-0
01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.072
A lot of men and women, lot of
the men wearing cowboy hats

8192e6cd-f062-41b7-b5e3-366294884eaa-1
01:13:28.072 --> 01:13:31.170
because this is appears to be
taking place.

e321255f-6453-4c83-834f-d7e502918c25-0
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.391
Quite a while ago, during kind
of like the Wild West, so a lot

e321255f-6453-4c83-834f-d7e502918c25-1
01:13:38.391 --> 01:13:43.868
of men wearing cowboy hats,
boots, carrying guns and and on

e321255f-6453-4c83-834f-d7e502918c25-2
01:13:43.868 --> 01:13:49.711
holsters on their belts. You see
women dressed in long dresses,

e321255f-6453-4c83-834f-d7e502918c25-3
01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:52.450
some of them are wearing hats.

e36ebbff-8967-4e59-bd9a-850f98ab47de-0
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:59.582
You see, let's see, there's a I
did say there's a jail. There's

e36ebbff-8967-4e59-bd9a-850f98ab47de-1
01:13:59.582 --> 01:14:04.705
some wanted posters on the
outside of the jail. There are

e36ebbff-8967-4e59-bd9a-850f98ab47de-2
01:14:04.705 --> 01:14:10.004
people. Oh, it looks like,
behind the jail and the hotel is

e36ebbff-8967-4e59-bd9a-850f98ab47de-3
01:14:10.004 --> 01:14:15.480
a gold mine. So you see like a
mound of gold and the gold is.

38d93f6d-bbf6-452a-bad5-bce5882a973a-0
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:21.344
I don't know if it's kind of
running through on the streets,

38d93f6d-bbf6-452a-bad5-bce5882a973a-1
01:14:21.344 --> 01:14:24.875
but there's a lot of people
entering and exiting the gold

38d93f6d-bbf6-452a-bad5-bce5882a973a-2
01:14:24.875 --> 01:14:25.850
mines there are.

db4cdf29-bcfc-44cd-a601-a0470439c885-0
01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.898
People on the top of the hotel
looks like they're tourists, and

db4cdf29-bcfc-44cd-a601-a0470439c885-1
01:14:32.898 --> 01:14:36.660
they're being held up by
somebody wearing a cowboy hat

db4cdf29-bcfc-44cd-a601-a0470439c885-2
01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.902
and a bandana scarf, and he's
got two guns in his hands. He's

db4cdf29-bcfc-44cd-a601-a0470439c885-3
01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:44.870
kind of holding them up. It
appears that there are people

db4cdf29-bcfc-44cd-a601-a0470439c885-4
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:46.170
robbing the saloon.

ae661df8-63f2-494a-b773-519e12c347ec-0
01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.389
So, so maybe this is like a hold
up. Maybe there's like people

ae661df8-63f2-494a-b773-519e12c347ec-1
01:14:51.389 --> 01:14:55.361
all in the town, but there's
also these people that came in

ae661df8-63f2-494a-b773-519e12c347ec-2
01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:59.464
and are robbing them. So there's
two men that are leaving the

ae661df8-63f2-494a-b773-519e12c347ec-3
01:14:59.464 --> 01:15:03.370
saloon on the top through the
window and they're carrying.

99806508-e785-4ca4-ae40-b9e937a55b33-0
01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:09.378
Bags. So it looks like they've
got bags of money. People coming

99806508-e785-4ca4-ae40-b9e937a55b33-1
01:15:09.378 --> 01:15:12.930
out of this saloon kind of
running very chaotic.

4864f9a7-c267-4a32-8530-62c1c9ed9cd2-0
01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:19.467
It's it looks like there's a
Stampede of Buffalo, but it's

4864f9a7-c267-4a32-8530-62c1c9ed9cd2-1
01:15:19.467 --> 01:15:23.765
Buffalo on an actual stamps. So
there's these like 29 cent

4864f9a7-c267-4a32-8530-62c1c9ed9cd2-2
01:15:23.765 --> 01:15:28.355
stamps of Buffalo and they're
all lined up behind one another.

4864f9a7-c267-4a32-8530-62c1c9ed9cd2-3
01:15:28.355 --> 01:15:32.798
That's very clever. There are
some wagons with people in the

4864f9a7-c267-4a32-8530-62c1c9ed9cd2-4
01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:35.639
wagons traveling through on the
roads.

b15c48fe-5798-4aef-b2f3-bfed19159993-0
01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:42.576
There's a on top of another
saloon there is looks like there

b15c48fe-5798-4aef-b2f3-bfed19159993-1
01:15:42.576 --> 01:15:47.461
were musicians playing violin,
playing the piano, and on some

b15c48fe-5798-4aef-b2f3-bfed19159993-2
01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:52.267
of the other saloons you see
even more people coming through

b15c48fe-5798-4aef-b2f3-bfed19159993-3
01:15:52.267 --> 01:15:54.710
the windows with bags of money.

cb285d42-6eb7-4a19-b68f-1201eba3796f-0
01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.357
There's people painting above
the bank, the sides of some of

cb285d42-6eb7-4a19-b68f-1201eba3796f-1
01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:05.570
the buildings, workers out, you
see.

9483d140-c3cc-4cef-8b36-f8af840f2b62-0
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:11.840
Actually, in the one on the
right. You see a train coming

9483d140-c3cc-4cef-8b36-f8af840f2b62-1
01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.020
through and you see workers with
the train. I don't know if it's

9483d140-c3cc-4cef-8b36-f8af840f2b62-2
01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:19.879
something is maybe broken.
They're kind of fixing something

9483d140-c3cc-4cef-8b36-f8af840f2b62-3
01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:23.930
on the wheel. See people waiting
for the train, people getting

9483d140-c3cc-4cef-8b36-f8af840f2b62-4
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.860
off, waving to each other and.

6f16e615-996b-4a6e-9279-994c55f6017d-0
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:32.515
You know, coming into town, so
it it appears that the scene on

6f16e615-996b-4a6e-9279-994c55f6017d-1
01:16:32.515 --> 01:16:36.623
the right is kind of, it's
crowded and there's a lot going

6f16e615-996b-4a6e-9279-994c55f6017d-2
01:16:36.623 --> 01:16:40.800
on, but it's normal. But the
scene on the left, you see all

6f16e615-996b-4a6e-9279-994c55f6017d-3
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.907
these people with guns kind of
robbing these people in the

6f16e615-996b-4a6e-9279-994c55f6017d-4
01:16:44.907 --> 01:16:46.300

That was a hard one, yeah.

44054f75-ddcd-428d-869c-71cd4be553ca-0
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:58.709
And OK, praise yourself because
OK, got another one. Alright.

44054f75-ddcd-428d-869c-71cd4be553ca-1
01:16:58.709 --> 01:17:04.415
Ohh, this one isn't as bad. This
one seems a little easier. Yeah.

44054f75-ddcd-428d-869c-71cd4be553ca-2
01:17:04.415 --> 01:17:09.516
I think the OK versions of the
Waldo books are little less

44054f75-ddcd-428d-869c-71cd4be553ca-3
01:17:09.516 --> 01:17:10.640
chaotic. Yes.

a13e4253-8dc0-4283-a2ac-b5623fd3dd16-0
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.697
#START_unfriendly_giants
Alright, so this one instead of

a13e4253-8dc0-4283-a2ac-b5623fd3dd16-1
01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:19.554
little movie scene, we've got
actually like a paper that

a13e4253-8dc0-4283-a2ac-b5623fd3dd16-2
01:17:19.554 --> 01:17:22.870
unrolls this one's called the
unfriendly giants.

bc80ecfc-5b83-4749-b4dd-fc6f6cde68cc-0
01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:33.648
So it looks like Waldo is in the
land of unfriendly giants. We

bc80ecfc-5b83-4749-b4dd-fc6f6cde68cc-1
01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:37.610
see land, literally. Greenery.

258f2dc8-bd70-4dc0-bfa0-ed6d6974c776-0
01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:43.296
Some patches of kind of like
forestry with lots of trees.

258f2dc8-bd70-4dc0-bfa0-ed6d6974c776-1
01:17:43.296 --> 01:17:47.583
Otherwise it's just kind of
grassy. There is a little bit of

258f2dc8-bd70-4dc0-bfa0-ed6d6974c776-2
01:17:47.583 --> 01:17:51.869
a Cliff in a hill towards the
top in the back of the picture

258f2dc8-bd70-4dc0-bfa0-ed6d6974c776-3
01:17:51.869 --> 01:17:56.297
leads up to kind of like a stone
castle. There's a windmill in

258f2dc8-bd70-4dc0-bfa0-ed6d6974c776-4
01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:56.929
the back.

f4abe06f-fea9-4756-a816-7fe55a4f4d4e-0
01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:02.728
There are some of those towers.
They're like wooden towers and

f4abe06f-fea9-4756-a816-7fe55a4f4d4e-1
01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:07.432
they have like a wooden. It's
not an axe, but it's like a

f4abe06f-fea9-4756-a816-7fe55a4f4d4e-2
01:18:07.432 --> 01:18:07.999
wooden.

e243bf42-fadc-4b50-8c77-dcfa1aa8dc1e-0
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:13.653
Piece that, uh, like a gavel
almost. That kind of comes down

e243bf42-fadc-4b50-8c77-dcfa1aa8dc1e-1
01:18:13.653 --> 01:18:14.660
and it helps.

6c6376c6-435f-4e57-a795-6dc31e70599e-0
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.810
It helps them with water and.

aae4cf3a-eb33-4023-a4e2-2ad299b82de9-0
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.560
Like farming and then.

1d4f3e64-9891-4468-8b69-0b82f8796642-0
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:30.978
There's obviously lots of little
people, people running through

1d4f3e64-9891-4468-8b69-0b82f8796642-1
01:18:30.978 --> 01:18:35.646
the town, people coming out from
a house, people working on the

1d4f3e64-9891-4468-8b69-0b82f8796642-2
01:18:35.646 --> 01:18:39.439
land, and some people have
swords, some people are.

4b7a5ab9-3e33-41c5-a68f-13721ec15ca2-0
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:43.640
Fighting.

4d8634e3-3aae-4d08-a3ac-083da44c16e0-0
01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:50.185
Some people are just climbing
the hill. But among all these

4d8634e3-3aae-4d08-a3ac-083da44c16e0-1
01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:55.358
people are these really big
giants. Predominantly, let's

4d8634e3-3aae-4d08-a3ac-083da44c16e0-2
01:18:55.358 --> 01:19:00.078
see, it looks like it's
predominantly men. However,

4d8634e3-3aae-4d08-a3ac-083da44c16e0-3
01:19:00.078 --> 01:19:02.709
there are wooden giant women.

08cad33e-5790-45c2-b204-36a87922cd74-0
01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.320
Um, they're they're actually.

aab3cd5b-a9ef-45e7-a1bd-7ecf7d5d76c5-0
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:07.480
Like wooden.

119b8662-8763-4577-a9d6-c777c30be8e9-0
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:13.951
Not statues, but they're like
wooden panels that are carved in

119b8662-8763-4577-a9d6-c777c30be8e9-1
01:19:13.951 --> 01:19:18.926
the shape of women and they are
painted and made-up to look like

119b8662-8763-4577-a9d6-c777c30be8e9-2
01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:23.518
women. So they've got hair,
faces, lips, they've got shirts

119b8662-8763-4577-a9d6-c777c30be8e9-3
01:19:23.518 --> 01:19:28.416
on, hands. They're one hand is
waving and the other one is down

119b8662-8763-4577-a9d6-c777c30be8e9-4
01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:32.855
and then they've got on skirts
and they're kind of on the

119b8662-8763-4577-a9d6-c777c30be8e9-5
01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:37.600
backside of these wooden towers
that are used in the farming.

9e9b6890-e706-4650-9b4d-8c4d108e0098-0
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.068
But the Giants are unaware that
these went these women are

9e9b6890-e706-4650-9b4d-8c4d108e0098-1
01:19:43.068 --> 01:19:47.791
wooden, because there is I see
two of the women and there is

9e9b6890-e706-4650-9b4d-8c4d108e0098-2
01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:52.824
man. No, there's I see three of
them, and there's a man, a giant

9e9b6890-e706-4650-9b4d-8c4d108e0098-3
01:19:52.824 --> 01:19:54.450
man, who is actually.

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-0
01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:00.333
Approaching the women like each
one and it looks like, I don't

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-1
01:20:00.333 --> 01:20:04.298
know, it's almost like they're
trying to kiss them because

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-2
01:20:04.298 --> 01:20:08.666
their lips are pointed out as if
they want to kiss. One has some

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-3
01:20:08.666 --> 01:20:13.034
flowers, although it's really a
tree, like a tree that he pulled

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-4
01:20:13.034 --> 01:20:17.268
out and he's giving it to her.
But there's all kinds of giants

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-5
01:20:17.268 --> 01:20:21.569
throughout here as well, and the
Giants seem to be not friendly

bec30cad-3791-48af-a25e-2fc99ee64902-6
01:20:21.569 --> 01:20:25.870
and kind of wreaking havoc. Some
are playing chess with little.

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-0
01:20:26.290 --> 01:20:30.732
With actual people, some are
drinking through straws, the

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-1
01:20:30.732 --> 01:20:35.175
water in the Little lakes and
rivers of the land. They're

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-2
01:20:35.175 --> 01:20:40.154
drinking all the water out with
the straw. Some are. There's one

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-3
01:20:40.154 --> 01:20:44.903
guy that had a couple guys that
have ropes and they're roping

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-4
01:20:44.903 --> 01:20:49.346
some of the little people
together. And then there's some

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-5
01:20:49.346 --> 01:20:54.095
that have put people on their
belts. They've like put them in

6f3d1d68-9ec7-47e7-b166-506b36323cca-6
01:20:54.095 --> 01:20:56.470
little holsters on their belts.

97580aca-3439-4dbf-bb8e-73bec0867182-0
01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:00.168
And they're carrying these
little people around as they run

97580aca-3439-4dbf-bb8e-73bec0867182-1
01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:01.620
around through the land.

b8f1b23e-ae12-4178-8a75-08856e886750-0
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.660
Making havoc.

Some.

01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:28.840
Uh from Waldo and he is at the
airport.

0cbd544c-5a6c-4b6c-9b68-51b4c4cce287-0
01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:34.069
{It says, it's me again, Waldo.
Folks. Some very strange things

0cbd544c-5a6c-4b6c-9b68-51b4c4cce287-1
01:21:34.069 --> 01:21:37.479
happened at the airport this
morning. A helicopter chopped

0cbd544c-5a6c-4b6c-9b68-51b4c4cce287-2
01:21:37.479 --> 01:21:40.542
down all the flagpoles, a
smuggler was caught hiding

0cbd544c-5a6c-4b6c-9b68-51b4c4cce287-3
01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:44.067
watches under his beard, and a
herd of elephants was getting

0cbd544c-5a6c-4b6c-9b68-51b4c4cce287-4
01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:46.900
onto a jumbo jet. Weird.} So we
are. We're at a.

54d64a8d-7bb7-4a88-8a1c-34de90934d17-0
01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.370
We're at a an airport. We can't.
We're kind of like on the.

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-0
01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:57.956
On the runway here because or
the tarmac or the runway, we can

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-1
01:21:57.956 --> 01:22:02.458
see all different types of
planes, some big planes and then

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-2
01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:07.034
some are smaller planes. We can
see the little shuttle buses

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-3
01:22:07.034 --> 01:22:11.536
that the that take people but
also that the workers use. So

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-4
01:22:11.536 --> 01:22:16.037
there's some shuttle buses that
actually have customers and

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-5
01:22:16.037 --> 01:22:20.389
people who are going to board
the airplane or deboard the

dbf16c2a-50ae-4642-b9f5-2c76afa1141e-6
01:22:20.389 --> 01:22:23.089
airplane and pick them up and
then.

fb96ab4c-aa3d-4c07-9dae-6e458c50a10a-0
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.833
Some of the little shuttles are
for the workers to carry luggage

fb96ab4c-aa3d-4c07-9dae-6e458c50a10a-1
01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:34.419
and to any equipment that they
might need to prep the plane. We

fb96ab4c-aa3d-4c07-9dae-6e458c50a10a-2
01:22:34.419 --> 01:22:35.380
do see the.

64991b28-62b5-46fe-a8c7-a720b09c80c8-0
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:40.460
The like air traffic control
building.

54de2a16-2c55-4a9d-8d61-3dcef75fb1ab-0
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:47.300
We see. And there's just planes
galore. There's actually, I want

54de2a16-2c55-4a9d-8d61-3dcef75fb1ab-1
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:51.640
to say there's a spaceship in
one corner. It looks like there

54de2a16-2c55-4a9d-8d61-3dcef75fb1ab-2
01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.670
might be some kind of rocket.

ea013594-07ff-4854-a3ee-171513f2e9c3-0
01:22:55.290 --> 01:23:00.360
On another one. Um, just all
kinds of different planes here.

87e44f91-de21-4151-ad20-3208c92c1cd8-0
01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.270
And then?

435ae289-0488-4223-b0b7-136d4f87f1ad-0
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.815
A lot going on. Like I said,
there's one big plane where

435ae289-0488-4223-b0b7-136d4f87f1ad-1
01:23:07.815 --> 01:23:11.371
people are deboarding, luggage
is being loaded. There are

435ae289-0488-4223-b0b7-136d4f87f1ad-2
01:23:11.371 --> 01:23:14.743
people boarding one of the
shuttles, obviously lots of

435ae289-0488-4223-b0b7-136d4f87f1ad-3
01:23:14.743 --> 01:23:18.606
workers, lots of workers running
around. One of the workers, I

435ae289-0488-4223-b0b7-136d4f87f1ad-4
01:23:18.606 --> 01:23:22.346
don't know if that's a fire
truck, I don't think so, but one

435ae289-0488-4223-b0b7-136d4f87f1ad-5
01:23:22.346 --> 01:23:25.290
of the worker, one of the
shuttles, has a hose.

84d27a59-0228-467f-bfb1-bc4222b0a78a-0
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:31.190
And it's spraying, it's spraying
people. Yeah, ohh.

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-0
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:37.614
There are, there's luggage that
and freight that has been set

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-1
01:23:37.614 --> 01:23:42.322
down and there are employees
hiding behind the freight that

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-2
01:23:42.322 --> 01:23:47.030
are smoking cigarettes. And so
there's smoke coming up from

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-3
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:51.973
behind the freight. And so this
shuttle is coming with a water

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-4
01:23:51.973 --> 01:23:56.602
hose because they probably think
something is on fire, but

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-5
01:23:56.602 --> 01:24:01.545
instead they're spraying some of
the people from another plane

290b1cec-4bf7-4698-875c-fbe9e967213c-6
01:24:01.545 --> 01:24:02.330
that that.

3afec174-a57e-4eea-8561-1e35c7ca4af7-0
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.610
Is deboarding.

004d67f4-be5f-4f74-84e0-a38bf343ec96-0
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.550
We can see.

0b2c8d0d-139f-41b4-8830-d13cd7b99796-0
01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.613
Let's see. There's a hot air
balloon. There's a helicopter.

0b2c8d0d-139f-41b4-8830-d13cd7b99796-1
01:24:13.613 --> 01:24:16.990
Just all kinds of things.
There's a random shoe.

01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:18.140
Out.

e867e366-048b-46d6-a694-21749092bb61-0
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.855
Uh, in the grassy part of the
runway and then at the bottom of

e867e366-048b-46d6-a694-21749092bb61-1
01:24:23.855 --> 01:24:28.557
the screen, we can kind of see
the inside of the building of

e867e366-048b-46d6-a694-21749092bb61-2
01:24:28.557 --> 01:24:32.719
the airport where lots of
passengers waiting, lots of

e867e366-048b-46d6-a694-21749092bb61-3
01:24:32.719 --> 01:24:36.650
airline flight attendants and
airline workers who.

3555ce6e-ba4b-448a-b2a8-ea76687f6336-0
01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.030
Who do the ticketing. The
baggage carousel.

3059d5cb-3093-46b9-8f96-1c6b5f723dff-0
01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:49.498
Possibly, maybe lost and found.
And you can kind of see them

3059d5cb-3093-46b9-8f96-1c6b5f723dff-1
01:24:49.498 --> 01:24:54.955
all. On the inside there is a
man who has a coat and he's got

3059d5cb-3093-46b9-8f96-1c6b5f723dff-2
01:24:54.955 --> 01:24:57.420
all kinds of watches on him.

c86e8535-e6ac-4939-bc22-076345dee06d-0
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:03.646
There is a trying to find the
elephant but I don't know. Ohh,

c86e8535-e6ac-4939-bc22-076345dee06d-1
01:25:03.646 --> 01:25:07.450
there are elephants boarding a
plane. Yep, there there's a

c86e8535-e6ac-4939-bc22-076345dee06d-2
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:11.060
jumbo jet and there are four
elephants. One is actually

c86e8535-e6ac-4939-bc22-076345dee06d-3
01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.670
stepping up and the other three
are in line to step up.

7f12a982-09e4-4532-9e17-8ccdacd8d200-0
01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.237
Um, and it does appear that the
flagpoles, the helicopter I

7f12a982-09e4-4532-9e17-8ccdacd8d200-1
01:25:21.237 --> 01:25:26.237
guess trying to land, did chop
down some of the flagpoles so

7f12a982-09e4-4532-9e17-8ccdacd8d200-2
01:25:26.237 --> 01:25:30.089
there's some flags on the
ground. #END_airport

91d7ea9f-c7fd-4669-ab1f-841de29fd4f2-0
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:33.960
Uh, yeah, it's uh, it's a lot.

58a4ce8f-6516-4362-ba81-04126c45902a-0
01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:37.240
That was good. OK.

97083e62-2b04-464f-94a0-f6b03cf0a81f-0
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.250
OK.

7b34e31a-26b1-480d-ba69-074352eefd25-0
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:52.473
#START_ancient_rome Alright, so
this where's Waldo takes us back

7b34e31a-26b1-480d-ba69-074352eefd25-1
01:25:52.473 --> 01:25:57.700
2000 years ago. This one is a
book that's open. It's called

7b34e31a-26b1-480d-ba69-074352eefd25-2
01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:03.015
fun in games in ancient Rome,
but instead of a you, it's a V

7b34e31a-26b1-480d-ba69-074352eefd25-3
01:26:03.015 --> 01:26:08.504
in fun because it's the the Old
English style from 2000 or the

7b34e31a-26b1-480d-ba69-074352eefd25-4
01:26:08.504 --> 01:26:10.770
old Roman style from 2000.

4f646d26-3404-4b84-bca6-a1cbbe3736fe-0
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:13.540
Years ago and we see.

98f9f012-16c0-43de-9dc8-0c78a2f9ca51-0
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.180
Inside um.

87ef8178-7c43-409d-9b55-db516a4ad487-0
01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:26.834
I guess it's like the Colosseum,
maybe? It's round, it's open air

87ef8178-7c43-409d-9b55-db516a4ad487-1
01:26:26.834 --> 01:26:34.035
and it appears to have some kind
of like a sand, a sand floor,

87ef8178-7c43-409d-9b55-db516a4ad487-2
01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:35.750
maybe. There's.

7f15f3a7-0da5-4fe5-8107-bda9802a4999-0
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:41.496
A lot going on on stage. There
are, it looks like the Colsseum.

7f15f3a7-0da5-4fe5-8107-bda9802a4999-1
01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:45.947
It does have a lot of people.
There's people sitting in the

7f15f3a7-0da5-4fe5-8107-bda9802a4999-2
01:26:45.947 --> 01:26:49.730
stands watching down to watch
the games there are.

6ee8ee99-b94c-4046-a726-862239e2f29c-0
01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.520
There are some.

d5681746-d050-46dc-8047-61e9a55d4211-0
01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.529
kind of like horse drawn
carriages, but there's instead

d5681746-d050-46dc-8047-61e9a55d4211-1
01:27:00.529 --> 01:27:05.065
of it being a carriage, there's
just a small little carriage on

d5681746-d050-46dc-8047-61e9a55d4211-2
01:27:05.065 --> 01:27:08.610
the backside. One of the horse
is reining people.

c850082f-9f8b-4ba8-a9a1-62555d2077d1-0
01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.667
And the other two have uh, well
they there was two people

c850082f-9f8b-4ba8-a9a1-62555d2077d1-1
01:27:13.667 --> 01:27:17.780
reining the horses, although on
one of them it looks like the

c850082f-9f8b-4ba8-a9a1-62555d2077d1-2
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.230
man has slipped off and is
trying to hold on to it.

9ddc88db-5449-49fa-9d16-4ff43a2bc6bd-0
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.590
There are lions that are.

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-0
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:31.291
Have gotten loose and there's a
couple that are running around.

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-1
01:27:31.291 --> 01:27:35.970
One has chased some people up
the side of the Coliseum. The

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-2
01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:40.962
there is also a group of lions
that has decided to climb on top

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-3
01:27:40.962 --> 01:27:45.485
of one another to allow the
Lions to get into the seating

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-4
01:27:45.485 --> 01:27:50.398
area. And so there's two lions
that have come over the top out

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-5
01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:55.546
of the arena and into the stands
and you see people just running.

1743c8ca-2e96-4e8a-8b60-0919235ee70f-6
01:27:55.546 --> 01:27:56.560
You see them.

5a6aaaa1-fcf8-40bb-88a0-4e5f44bc0570-0
01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.931
Leaving behind their belongings
and they're running on that part

5a6aaaa1-fcf8-40bb-88a0-4e5f44bc0570-1
01:28:00.931 --> 01:28:04.864
of the Coliseum. Meanwhile,
everybody else in the stadium on

5a6aaaa1-fcf8-40bb-88a0-4e5f44bc0570-2
01:28:04.864 --> 01:28:07.960
the other side is really still
cheering on the.

eb700414-28d1-4831-9681-d8f8a03f4efb-0
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.867
The games. Behind the main
entryway into the Coliseum, you

eb700414-28d1-4831-9681-d8f8a03f4efb-1
01:28:12.867 --> 01:28:17.003
see the guards and you see kind
of like a bed, like a royal

eb700414-28d1-4831-9681-d8f8a03f4efb-2
01:28:17.003 --> 01:28:21.277
style bed seating area. So you
would assume that there's some

eb700414-28d1-4831-9681-d8f8a03f4efb-3
01:28:21.277 --> 01:28:25.344
kind of royalty sitting there
because there's there's some

eb700414-28d1-4831-9681-d8f8a03f4efb-4
01:28:25.344 --> 01:28:29.825
guards standing next to them and
then there's guards in front of

eb700414-28d1-4831-9681-d8f8a03f4efb-5
01:28:29.825 --> 01:28:30.169
them.

53ef32ea-f8e2-4f1f-a73a-86cd2246279a-0
01:28:32.130 --> 01:28:35.390
And there's people with Spears,
there's people.

2fb553fe-85df-486d-9fa4-191e173621d0-0
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:40.970
There's tigers, there's Jaguars,
there's.

44e9e860-c76c-40de-8d06-ccb85c497ee0-0
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:42.420
Um.

df0d48ae-76fa-4d33-8f84-aa879c98c12d-0
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:48.900
Or maybe leopards, all kinds of
these wild animals and.

ce1ca23f-a074-4aee-beaf-6a02e72bd692-0
01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:54.687
Some of them are wreaking havoc
with the people. There's one

ce1ca23f-a074-4aee-beaf-6a02e72bd692-1
01:28:54.687 --> 01:28:59.395
who's on top of a a man. There's
another one who's quite hungry

ce1ca23f-a074-4aee-beaf-6a02e72bd692-2
01:28:59.395 --> 01:29:03.808
and is licking his lips. He's
got on a bib and a fork and a

ce1ca23f-a074-4aee-beaf-6a02e72bd692-3
01:29:03.808 --> 01:29:04.250
knife.

6e592f9c-2c5f-4409-b126-b13507fc74c8-0
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:07.280
Ready to eat them.

1508e489-5bd6-4b33-9110-99a643cddb44-0
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:13.519
But you see, you know, all these
people kind of running through

1508e489-5bd6-4b33-9110-99a643cddb44-1
01:29:13.519 --> 01:29:14.900
on the sand and it.

7db967ba-a74a-419d-80bb-dc3d4766cc0c-0
01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.758
I don't know. This is bizarre.
Yeah, they have Shields and

7db967ba-a74a-419d-80bb-dc3d4766cc0c-1
01:29:20.758 --> 01:29:24.610
swords, you know, they're,
they're, they're in the middle

7db967ba-a74a-419d-80bb-dc3d4766cc0c-2
01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:28.661
of games. But somehow these,
these animals have gotten loose

7db967ba-a74a-419d-80bb-dc3d4766cc0c-3
01:29:28.661 --> 01:29:32.646
and descended onto the games
inside of the Coliseum. And so

7db967ba-a74a-419d-80bb-dc3d4766cc0c-4
01:29:32.646 --> 01:29:36.100
there's a there's a lot going
on. #END_ancient_rome

01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:39.910
Yeah, that was good. OK.

b44fa04f-3243-439e-8d8d-384dcb71c03c-0
01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:43.260

01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:52.020
The fun goes on, OK.

1dc71943-728c-4204-9e49-6bd6de07b8e9-0
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:58.535
#START_campsite Now we've got
another where's Waldo postcard.

1dc71943-728c-4204-9e49-6bd6de07b8e9-1

He's traveling and. Umm.

fe50c82a-9b05-4724-a75c-1936518108d3-0
01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:10.413
It's so we see an area of land
that's fairly flat, some

fe50c82a-9b05-4724-a75c-1936518108d3-1
01:30:10.413 --> 01:30:15.838
greenery, some some grassy land,
maybe some bushes, not a lot of

fe50c82a-9b05-4724-a75c-1936518108d3-2
01:30:15.838 --> 01:30:21.346
trees. We do see some trees, but
it's pretty flat and open. There

fe50c82a-9b05-4724-a75c-1936518108d3-3
01:30:21.346 --> 01:30:26.270
is a little canal that kind of
runs through the center and

fe50c82a-9b05-4724-a75c-1936518108d3-4
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:31.361
there's a little arched bridge
that you can walk over to get

fe50c82a-9b05-4724-a75c-1936518108d3-5
01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:32.530
from one side.

d616cdc6-7159-4e9b-8b34-9602ea958968-0
01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.900
Of the canal to the other.

b2bd8617-cae9-4e25-a46d-f3bed49d094c-0
01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:40.117
And on the top part you have
like a little camping area, so

b2bd8617-cae9-4e25-a46d-f3bed49d094c-1
01:30:40.117 --> 01:30:44.992
you have a lot of people with
RV's and campers, and on the

b2bd8617-cae9-4e25-a46d-f3bed49d094c-2
01:30:44.992 --> 01:30:48.050
South side you have people in
tents.

bd88bf13-1221-4105-9c2f-8dc6cf18e4f5-0
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.530
Um.

74b4dd54-d6ff-4a14-97be-c2734d8f271b-0
01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:57.664
People in tents and there might
even be like a little house or

74b4dd54-d6ff-4a14-97be-c2734d8f271b-1
01:30:57.664 --> 01:31:02.654
or there's some kind of
structure off to the side. There

74b4dd54-d6ff-4a14-97be-c2734d8f271b-2
01:31:02.654 --> 01:31:03.530
are a few.

204050b2-5d58-4ebb-b3b4-460820f22210-0
01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.619
Looks like there's bulls and and
cattle that are in some grassy

204050b2-5d58-4ebb-b3b4-460820f22210-1
01:31:09.619 --> 01:31:14.443
areas. They're kind of gated off
and in the grassy areas, but

204050b2-5d58-4ebb-b3b4-460820f22210-2
01:31:14.443 --> 01:31:19.500
primarily you've got the campers
and the tents on the South side

204050b2-5d58-4ebb-b3b4-460820f22210-3
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.690
and the campers in the RV's and
the Umm.

3986d5d6-27af-4e58-9e33-a7f6d04cf2b8-0
01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.430
Up on the top. You do see.

432ebb63-acf6-4187-bbe9-793cef6da0e6-0
01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.984
Let's see, there's people
running, walking, bicycling.

432ebb63-acf6-4187-bbe9-793cef6da0e6-1
01:31:33.984 --> 01:31:39.114
There's somebody grilling out
outside of their RV camper.

432ebb63-acf6-4187-bbe9-793cef6da0e6-2
01:31:39.114 --> 01:31:39.910

You know, people are just kind
of mingling with each other and

1f267244-21f3-4d9e-87d8-059fdb0bad08-1
01:31:46.202 --> 01:31:50.745
talking. People are walking
along the sidewalk to the canal.

1f267244-21f3-4d9e-87d8-059fdb0bad08-2
01:31:50.745 --> 01:31:55.586
Some are there's a man riding a
bike. There's a man with a fish,

1f267244-21f3-4d9e-87d8-059fdb0bad08-3
01:31:55.586 --> 01:32:00.130
a couple men with fishing poles
that are fishing. There is a

1f267244-21f3-4d9e-87d8-059fdb0bad08-4
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:04.822
little boat with some men that
it's sailing through the canal.

1f267244-21f3-4d9e-87d8-059fdb0bad08-5
01:32:04.822 --> 01:32:09.291
And there's also, Umm, I don't
think it's a kayak, but it's

1f267244-21f3-4d9e-87d8-059fdb0bad08-6
01:32:09.291 --> 01:32:11.600
kind of like a very small boat.

ebf69e5a-7314-4e32-a276-70a2898ee6dc-0
01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:16.657
With a couple of people sailing
through as well. In the water

ebf69e5a-7314-4e32-a276-70a2898ee6dc-1
01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:21.081
there are looks like there's
some fish. There are some

ebf69e5a-7314-4e32-a276-70a2898ee6dc-2
01:32:21.081 --> 01:32:25.826
mermaids that are up and they
are waving to the fishermen.

ebf69e5a-7314-4e32-a276-70a2898ee6dc-3
01:32:25.826 --> 01:32:30.331
Umm, down in the distance
there's actually a shark. You

ebf69e5a-7314-4e32-a276-70a2898ee6dc-4
01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:33.790
can see a shark fin heading into
the town.

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-0
01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:39.320
Um, and then on the South side
where the tents are, you see

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-1
01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.518
there's a lot of hikers and
campers, people with their

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-2
01:32:43.518 --> 01:32:47.793
walking sticks and big heavy
camping like backpack type

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-3
01:32:47.793 --> 01:32:52.602
hiking backpack. And they are,
they're really thirsty. You can

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-4
01:32:52.602 --> 01:32:57.106
tell they've been walking and
they're trying to get to the

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-5
01:32:57.106 --> 01:33:02.068
water and some of them are lying
on the floor with their tongues

0d827634-53c5-4e8e-99e7-97c3a171c991-6
01:33:02.068 --> 01:33:04.740
out because they are so
exhausted.

39c56d55-ef9e-4e78-bd43-f90b5ddbdaf3-0
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:10.265
They're literally having to
crawl their way to to get water

39c56d55-ef9e-4e78-bd43-f90b5ddbdaf3-1
01:33:10.265 --> 01:33:14.590
at the building or try to get
over to the canal.

c02c4ce9-647c-4e23-a2bc-fb8bc7d9069a-0
01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:19.366
And then everybody else is just
kind of hanging outside of their

c02c4ce9-647c-4e23-a2bc-fb8bc7d9069a-1
01:33:19.366 --> 01:33:20.980
tent. Uh, there are a couple of.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.350
Uh.

44ad0852-32a8-42cd-93de-a765b01ba0ee-0
01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.407
Looks like it's a maitre-d' and
a man and a woman in like

44ad0852-32a8-42cd-93de-a765b01ba0ee-1
01:33:29.407 --> 01:33:33.832
lederhosen, maybe with beer.
Somebody's playing a guitar and

44ad0852-32a8-42cd-93de-a765b01ba0ee-2
01:33:33.832 --> 01:33:38.547
there's some hippies. There is a
hippie tent with flowers. There

44ad0852-32a8-42cd-93de-a765b01ba0ee-3
01:33:38.547 --> 01:33:42.610
is a what is supposed to be a
teepee with some Indians.

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-0
01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:47.503
Um, each tent has something
going on. One tent has somebody

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-1
01:33:47.503 --> 01:33:51.451
trying to put it up, and the
tent has collapsed on top of

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-2
01:33:51.451 --> 01:33:55.943
them. Some other people, they're
just getting their tent started.

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-3
01:33:55.943 --> 01:34:00.163
They've got a like they've got
it still in a bag. And there's

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-4
01:34:00.163 --> 01:34:04.247
there's some Bunny rabbits,
there's some birds, some people

01:34:04.247 --> 01:34:08.262
dining outside their tent,
having a little picnic. There's

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-6
01:34:08.262 --> 01:34:12.074
some people drinking coffee, and
it looks like a man is

37e3544d-dc53-4e6c-92ec-9313da813e53-7
01:34:12.074 --> 01:34:13.979
accidentally pouring coffee.

734e7dd2-20cd-408d-b56a-3f90bc0df30f-0
01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.557
on another man. #END_campsite
Umm, OK. And yeah, that was

734e7dd2-20cd-408d-b56a-3f90bc0df30f-1
01:34:18.557 --> 01:34:21.260

Let's see what's this one.

551433cf-0523-4a6d-ad9b-218cdb505b98-0
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.560
Would do. Two more of these will
be done OK.

133c2110-5953-4b78-8a98-bc43daa173b1-0
01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.967
#START_birthday_party_fun So

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.692
And it's in somebody's backyard.
There's a fence, there's a brown

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.902
Party decorations, like the
little hanging signs that are

934e6b29-bcf3-4455-b982-d8f0b3fc0b6f-1

01:35:16.248 --> 01:35:18.309
when you first enter in.

1f7b46d1-74e4-4587-afea-665a59d2ba93-0
01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.918
And it looks like, uh, people
had to come in costume.

1f7b46d1-74e4-4587-afea-665a59d2ba93-1
01:35:24.918 --> 01:35:30.890
Everybody's in costume. So we've
got football players, we have

1f7b46d1-74e4-4587-afea-665a59d2ba93-2
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:36.861

01:36:47.024 --> 01:36:50.059
from the different activities.
And then there is a neighbor,

cc2a11ba-44c3-466e-ab4d-96741965f4c6-2
01:36:50.059 --> 01:36:53.094
there's an old lady who's a
neighbor, and she's peering over

cc2a11ba-44c3-466e-ab4d-96741965f4c6-3
01:36:53.094 --> 01:36:55.980

Very summery, yes.

70ca11e2-02aa-4214-a008-2ac53ebbe3cb-0
01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:12.190
Oh, this will be a little
longer. So that'll be longer.

70ca11e2-02aa-4214-a008-2ac53ebbe3cb-1
01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:15.490

All right. How am I doing on
