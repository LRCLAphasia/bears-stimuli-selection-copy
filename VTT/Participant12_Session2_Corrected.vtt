ab738008-e967-4699-941e-4f0d5fddbc37-0
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.888
OK, so as a reminder, with
graphic novels you're going to

ab738008-e967-4699-941e-4f0d5fddbc37-1
00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:09.661
look at a series of pictures
that tell a story. Imagine that

ab738008-e967-4699-941e-4f0d5fddbc37-2
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:13.188
you were telling us someone who
cannot see the pictures.

ab738008-e967-4699-941e-4f0d5fddbc37-3
00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:17.023
Describe what you see and what
is happening as you go through

ab738008-e967-4699-941e-4f0d5fddbc37-4
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:17.889
the story and.

d857733d-7b9f-4491-8094-d7180c7b1009-0
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.670
This is our story. It's
approximately 20 slides.

3d3641a4-fc7c-4f3f-9a71-c8ba78194ace-0
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.234
And um, like before, when you're
done with each slide, you could

3d3641a4-fc7c-4f3f-9a71-c8ba78194ace-1
00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:31.440
tell me to move on.

f07107b1-7115-4e97-a19d-fec0f25bff53-0
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.840
Great hoops and you could begin
whenever.

df94736f-255c-42cc-9736-73213b452caf-0
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.040
You're ready?

ac6c09af-b7a3-4961-b8cb-c29c75026aba-0
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.492
#START_return So it looks like
this is a continuation of the

ac6c09af-b7a3-4961-b8cb-c29c75026aba-1
00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:48.560
story that we were doing last
time.

76f6187e-1921-445c-8fbc-a071c6e47392-0
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.060
And it's set in a city which.

10239ed8-6ce9-47c4-bab6-1dabfc068c78-0
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.290
Looks like it might be New York
City.

d9232eab-2507-4250-bf6a-48330e5f2c22-0
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.581
In a very old apartment
building, old in a good way I

d9232eab-2507-4250-bf6a-48330e5f2c22-1
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:02.761
think and looks like they are
the second the first and second

d9232eab-2507-4250-bf6a-48330e5f2c22-2
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:06.672
floors of this old apartment
building and the highlighted

d9232eab-2507-4250-bf6a-48330e5f2c22-3
00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:10.650
room on the upper left is a
person I think is the dad, and

d9232eab-2507-4250-bf6a-48330e5f2c22-4
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550
he seems to be working at a
drawing board.

a918753a-fd47-437c-9994-162b16eded63-0
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.970
And.

24f91cab-9b68-495f-825d-a03f367bf984-0
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.241
He's highlighted in color, as is
the kite, the red kite, which

24f91cab-9b68-495f-825d-a03f367bf984-1
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.800
has made its way in that door.

0a10ba55-21a7-4f31-ab31-003f0dd1b96b-0
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.557
From where? I don't know,
because we're seeing other

0a10ba55-21a7-4f31-ab31-003f0dd1b96b-1
00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:34.161
rooms, but that red kite figured
in the story last week. OK, then

0a10ba55-21a7-4f31-ab31-003f0dd1b96b-2
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:38.276
we can look across and follow
the stairway down. The other

0a10ba55-21a7-4f31-ab31-003f0dd1b96b-3
00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:42.741
rooms are interesting but empty
of people. There's no people in

0a10ba55-21a7-4f31-ab31-003f0dd1b96b-4
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:43.089
them.

5acadd95-16e1-4b6f-aad5-c0c712078e36-0
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.367
Until you get to the lower right
and that appears to be the young

5acadd95-16e1-4b6f-aad5-c0c712078e36-1
00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:54.364
girl's bedroom. And she again
has her red wand or crayon and

5acadd95-16e1-4b6f-aad5-c0c712078e36-2
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.149
she's drawing a door on her
wall.

0efe92bc-b822-4f1d-9127-98f8e9d5be4d-0
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.230
And has something red in her
arm. Don't know exactly what.

ec066ae9-34d6-4260-8e25-fa27abd72144-0
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.805
The figure red's important now.
Also there's a red balloon like

ec066ae9-34d6-4260-8e25-fa27abd72144-1
00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:13.440
the one she and her her, you
know, companion or you know,

ec066ae9-34d6-4260-8e25-fa27abd72144-2
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.400
cohort took.

58d2b83c-1d57-4447-abf1-1dffecea086e-0
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.791
Through the Kingdom last week
when we saw it, there's a fan in

58d2b83c-1d57-4447-abf1-1dffecea086e-1
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:24.082
the room. It's a beautiful old
apartment building and it looks

58d2b83c-1d57-4447-abf1-1dffecea086e-2
00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:24.899
tidy, homey.

e3b04126-672c-4285-a514-7f4da558e4b6-0
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.229
Alrighty. I think that's as much
as I see there, alrighty. So

e3b04126-672c-4285-a514-7f4da558e4b6-1
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.959
here is the dad, and he's seeing
the kite. It's fallen on the

e3b04126-672c-4285-a514-7f4da558e4b6-2
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.320
floor.

99c58b28-4831-4879-93f6-bab6893abfe4-0
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.400
And behind him and he picks it
up.

2aeda4a8-f548-48d7-aac7-0cff6fe6f3a7-0
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.010
And then he seems.

dc2701c6-21f6-49d0-8bc5-8255bb00d05d-0
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.540
Not he disappears from that
drawing, but.

12ae0e64-aad6-4354-a2be-85ac56976376-0
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.888
Realizes that his daughter's up
some up to something runs to her

12ae0e64-aad6-4354-a2be-85ac56976376-1
00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:55.422
room, and he's looking through a
doorway. The doorway that she

12ae0e64-aad6-4354-a2be-85ac56976376-2
00:02:55.422 --> 00:02:59.884
drew, which turned into a red
door, and she's passed into the

12ae0e64-aad6-4354-a2be-85ac56976376-3
00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:01.180
tunnel from there.

53cde784-74d8-4a04-be18-dced8df3358f-0
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.000
So it'll be interesting to see.

63e444f2-79ca-439a-bb27-0f8f2f0c0b70-0
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.798
Next, the dad enters that
doorway and a whole world opens

63e444f2-79ca-439a-bb27-0f8f2f0c0b70-1
00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:12.470
up. It's the forest again. And.

e02b77df-8c36-4a06-9e13-c6daa7523cb0-0
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.849
Probably a park more than a
forest because it's lit by

e02b77df-8c36-4a06-9e13-c6daa7523cb0-1
00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:17.420
lanterns.

d8715449-1d31-4f76-9644-6a06696faa00-0
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.725
There's a small river or stream
going through it, and her red

d8715449-1d31-4f76-9644-6a06696faa00-1
00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:25.190
balloon is sitting on a boat
dock.

464022bf-2609-4033-8972-ec742a437680-0
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.400
On the far right, but there's no
sign of his daughter.

d7fb0194-4e0f-4747-99b9-85c698459ea1-0
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.940
Yeah.

735779c7-a9ab-44ca-ad11-81fa3e111b9d-0
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.140
OK picks up her red balloon or
orb and.

4961307b-47e1-457c-ab08-e68da2f84282-0
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.060
Sees kind of a dragon boat
coming, coming towards him.

9eed67fa-b89d-49e8-b7bf-48f2612e62dc-0
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.230
And.

9b1604d0-afff-48b1-b9b1-fe8b5ea3eec0-0
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.180
He gets on board.

d0c1f052-d337-44f0-b2e9-f9499a8ff042-0
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.390
And is actively looking for his
daughter.

26ee91fd-1594-479d-b87a-05ed0ea215fe-0
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.790
Looks like the boat heads off
from the dock.

7b302ca4-ed2e-4af9-8bbe-c8ed0f274104-0
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.780
He gets to the Kingdom on that
stream and it's night time.

7b302ca4-ed2e-4af9-8bbe-c8ed0f274104-1
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.620
There's a huge full moon.

0b7fd7f1-0ae8-4879-b9bc-7b769a65ea60-0
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.024
Lighting up all those buildings
with their gold Spires and all

0b7fd7f1-0ae8-4879-b9bc-7b769a65ea60-1
00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:21.253
the turrets and he spots his
daughter on I think what you

0b7fd7f1-0ae8-4879-b9bc-7b769a65ea60-2
00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:25.410
would call an aqueduct going
across the river ahead, and

0b7fd7f1-0ae8-4879-b9bc-7b769a65ea60-3
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.890
she's in that little red
rowboat.

8cef19dd-cf12-4fcf-86a3-8f0417f1ed1c-0
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.398
And again, she's doesn't have
her pal with her, she's all on

8cef19dd-cf12-4fcf-86a3-8f0417f1ed1c-1
00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:34.750
her own. She seems to be on a
mission.

408d8a86-5223-4c7f-bbc1-7e3410fc75f7-0
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.090
Up above.

144d0157-6d23-4ba1-a6c1-9d1c45c9a00c-0
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.070
Where she's passing, there's a
beautiful.

90415602-184c-4932-81fe-a9d68c75e4df-0
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.894
Like, what would you call it? A
gazebo, almost. And it's lit up.

90415602-184c-4932-81fe-a9d68c75e4df-1
00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:50.437
It looks like that's possibly
where she would be heading. And

90415602-184c-4932-81fe-a9d68c75e4df-2
00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:53.979
then meanwhile, the moonlight on
the water is very beautiful.

06f86150-0dec-4803-8b65-983179ca759e-0
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.430
But the dad's concerned he's
going to try to catch up to her.

81de8e2c-245a-4b5c-b5e5-6840ed0e0ea0-0
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.550
Boy, and somehow he does and.

d66e33e2-8771-4444-ab5e-7701239f6e45-0
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.110
She has arrived.

cf3cd920-22f6-469c-9fa0-45474a6ca040-0
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.293
At that gazebo. And there's her
friend, the young boy and their

cf3cd920-22f6-469c-9fa0-45474a6ca040-1
00:05:15.293 --> 00:05:18.050
bird, who's now purple again.

7eab7ca1-50d0-42ff-88eb-982c8697cd50-0
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.078
And either the king or a younger
version of himself. And just

7eab7ca1-50d0-42ff-88eb-982c8697cd50-1
00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:24.170
then the dad arrives and catches
up with him.

eab2938f-0e31-4f78-a5a0-cf6578c51548-0
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.330
It's the king, OK, that's the
king.

1c3597b9-bc69-44c0-8ce2-378688831692-0
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.000
And he's asking the king what's
going on.

d4d29ac9-a0af-428a-a610-b75e59b2f3e1-0
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.070
The girls and the boy.

39e22299-f277-4a79-82fc-53cb726a5fcc-0
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.622
Seemed fine. It looks as though
the girl knows she has. She

39e22299-f277-4a79-82fc-53cb726a5fcc-1
00:05:42.622 --> 00:05:46.977
wants to be sitting in that King
seat from the looks of the her

39e22299-f277-4a79-82fc-53cb726a5fcc-2
00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:47.930
body language.

07c4420e-03ee-4b6c-a7aa-ea70d4d1ceec-0
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.540
But Umm.

f4c584ff-856e-4326-8f03-0ec3399009d5-0
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.310
The king appears to be friendly.
Hope so.

f29c5c05-0fdf-4f4b-bec3-12e6ce8e3ed9-0
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.270
OK, now we're seeing the view of
the whole palace.

09d796e7-081d-419b-ba8c-ec0e10d6d859-0
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.689
From where the four of them are
standing and there's someone

09d796e7-081d-419b-ba8c-ec0e10d6d859-1
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.938
threatening that's coming out of
the front of the boat that the

09d796e7-081d-419b-ba8c-ec0e10d6d859-2
00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:14.930
father just took to get there.

8f99b143-53e7-4ea2-b092-af368cf07858-0
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.241
Boat's some kind of an animal
shape and there's a door in its

8f99b143-53e7-4ea2-b092-af368cf07858-1
00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:21.760
chest.

13da5871-5a96-4e47-b3e4-65a71edc70bf-0
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.060
Some kind of a knight with.

1d13bb20-7236-4905-a970-adccf9280bda-0
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.101
You know, weapons seems to be
entering in. And the bird senses

1d13bb20-7236-4905-a970-adccf9280bda-1
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.620
the danger. The quetzal bird is
flying around above them.

17ed6f4f-f1b4-4068-9e9e-ddf367c6eca8-0
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.800
The boy has the purple wand. The
girl has the red wand.

34a33e1e-a231-4c16-8ba1-cb9a7185dab8-0
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.200
Oh, and the king.

de4bfbb3-39dd-4bfe-bff3-ab48824da7be-0
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.920
In the next frame, has a gold
wand and is holding it aloft.

43f4d0b5-10d2-48c1-9fec-c5946577be56-0
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.100
To stop.

bb18bd57-6503-4a75-9a95-6f9dadc97410-0
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.494
The soldiers from coming up any
farther, he's got the boy by the

bb18bd57-6503-4a75-9a95-6f9dadc97410-1
00:06:54.494 --> 00:06:58.850
hand and is protecting them to
the best of his ability.

97fc1bbe-2c14-4139-8a4c-8d2ecf12c658-0
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.920
Stars are out.

8fcd08fb-bb54-4b15-9787-666c1fe0d53f-0
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.070
OK, the king.

b45a83fa-f973-4f51-9c5b-7a8e46370d74-0
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.380
Wields his wand.

c3bd6d92-5974-439d-8b1a-5ffad66e72d7-0
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.060
And it becomes a sword. He's
drawn. He's drawn a sword.

dda866a1-f47a-4a16-b330-6d3afdf55bb4-0
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.080
And points it at the first.

bb60dc72-132d-4576-ad6b-a553ace03f3e-0
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.910
Of those soldiers.

41dfb50c-1a43-4300-90a1-88085e076898-0
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.120
OK, that soldiers got some crazy
weapon.

e0ed50f6-13d0-40b8-8dca-18b7737011ab-0
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.050
And it seems to.

a82904a0-e872-457c-b645-6eb8fa2945c3-0
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.510
Throw the king off.

c0909dc6-7e77-4f3c-a17c-6166d3d48876-0
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:39.310
His balance and he loses his
sword and is taken hostage.

74e6111b-2bb2-40a5-b7fb-79fe3d0b36f8-0
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.247
One of them by two soldiers and
the third heads off, chasing the

74e6111b-2bb2-40a5-b7fb-79fe3d0b36f8-1
00:07:46.247 --> 00:07:48.100
dad and the two children.

e83782ee-1c8d-4442-b622-8567db27af84-0
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.050
OK, the soldier's awfully small.
It's really interesting.

fb3074f2-5e7e-4568-820f-e032522e7919-0
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.500
Umm.

ff4d6afc-267e-46d8-b6c1-3ebff9bb341e-0
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.430
Girl's holding the bird for
protection.

777b9c2d-35be-452a-a908-d485ec44316d-0
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.678
And as they do that, the boy
draws something. Oh my goodness,

777b9c2d-35be-452a-a908-d485ec44316d-1
00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:10.610
he draws a Pegasus with his
purple.

05826314-6860-43a0-943c-3fe814af6c7c-0
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.610
wand crayon.

f352d91e-3a91-4dd9-8838-4e20fd02f901-0
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.170
And the three of them boy, the
girl and the dad.

8f4de3c6-028e-4eb5-9021-e3b91c585c56-0
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.030
With the bird, hop onto the
Pegasus and escape.

9ff646b8-239e-4eae-9ada-e9c23fbfb6df-0
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.404
From that gazebo, leaving the
soldiers behind. And I'm sure

9ff646b8-239e-4eae-9ada-e9c23fbfb6df-1
00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.210
they just hope the King's going
to be all right.

1b10fc49-ac57-4e7c-b121-245e7f972841-0
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.690
Off they go.

ef6ecaa7-d04a-43dc-bca8-8f33174a565f-0
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.000
Wow, this is an amazing view of
where they've just been.

62b19f34-45fb-48ed-99d5-c8f743dc22b2-0
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.370
But unfortunately, what they're
seeing is that that.

8127da6a-798f-45f7-8fe5-588b57f95afb-0
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.720
boat

294ef182-93a5-4f16-aebc-4eb633519632-0
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.350
And the shape of some kind of a
creature.

90b8da0f-01bc-499a-9335-f21876b579a7-0
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.410
Has sprouted wings and it's
flying and pursuing them.

ec7edd9d-ca49-436f-92b2-8d74637f9e6b-0
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.490
And they're both airborne.

b4cb2d8a-2b6b-468e-aeb4-27617c09abae-0
00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.590
Heading off?

7fdbd432-466a-440e-8254-fafa8c5abc71-0
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.034
We'll see what happens. There's
going to be an air battle. Looks

7fdbd432-466a-440e-8254-fafa8c5abc71-1
00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:07.350
like. Oh Oh my gosh.

c365225f-e130-4568-b5c0-f467102a3391-0
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:14.079
So the soldiers have some kind
of crazy weapons that are that

c365225f-e130-4568-b5c0-f467102a3391-1
00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:14.440
are.

64180a98-c914-458a-9258-ff1b0c73ebbc-0
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.996
Coming. It's like it's a box
that these soldiers hold and

64180a98-c914-458a-9258-ff1b0c73ebbc-1
00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:19.540
they shoot.

57274426-1cfa-4d67-b79d-1254a9a27652-0
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.363
Never seen anything quite like
it. It looks like an old

57274426-1cfa-4d67-b79d-1254a9a27652-1
00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:28.767
fashioned camera, but it's a
weapon and they they obliterate

57274426-1cfa-4d67-b79d-1254a9a27652-2
00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:32.739
the purple Centaur flying
Centaur that the dad and the

57274426-1cfa-4d67-b79d-1254a9a27652-3
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:37.143
daughter and the boy were on.
And they go. All three of them

57274426-1cfa-4d67-b79d-1254a9a27652-4
00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:41.547
go flying through the air, but
the king manages to catch the

57274426-1cfa-4d67-b79d-1254a9a27652-5
00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.270
young boy.

dde1995a-f4dd-48e4-96c8-842746b59062-0
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.676
Meanwhile, there are feathers
from the Centaur all over the

dde1995a-f4dd-48e4-96c8-842746b59062-1
00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:48.470
place, and.

61bc9625-9e76-4325-9ffc-0a9e4b58267b-0
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.531
The dad and his daughter are
free falling. She's even losing

61bc9625-9e76-4325-9ffc-0a9e4b58267b-1
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:55.490
her crown. But has her crayon.

c73f1983-609f-4b4f-b517-805efc38c0bb-0
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.970
See what happens.

1b6dff80-14ba-49e8-9228-b673a251609f-0
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.360
Whoa, OK, so they they fall into
the river.

926e6ec3-1ced-4c97-8511-f6f163eaaf78-0
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:11.328
And of course, there's a lot
under the river, as well as

926e6ec3-1ced-4c97-8511-f6f163eaaf78-1
00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:16.212
fish. Falling, falling. The bird
is with them and the daughter

926e6ec3-1ced-4c97-8511-f6f163eaaf78-2
00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:18.150
starts drawing some kind.

4cbdb80f-b7b9-4e6c-94fb-81d57de06b85-0
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.350
Of a shape around them with her
red wand, the birds very

4cbdb80f-b7b9-4e6c-94fb-81d57de06b85-1
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.897
comfortable underwater.
Meanwhile, they're all

4cbdb80f-b7b9-4e6c-94fb-81d57de06b85-2
00:10:24.897 --> 00:10:25.440
breathing.

e022a817-7abc-4a30-99e7-26b25a0535ca-0
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.670
OK.

400db32b-7cbd-4115-b419-9f8b86ecdb6b-0
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.580
Ah, she's throwing them a
submarine.

b430a2fb-9533-47d0-8d9a-c9e785d3cdb0-0
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.590
Red submarine, of course.

1884fd9a-9073-412f-8573-2938e57ba673-0
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.315
And it's almost as if they're
exploring this underground area

1884fd9a-9073-412f-8573-2938e57ba673-1
00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:40.620
with.

87b7c067-b41f-4af5-8806-827e5dfe0f12-0
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.130
with um

bb814afa-78d3-45ee-89d9-9861c65962ff-0
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.180
Sea growths that looks like
cactus.

f50538d3-19f3-491f-8367-ce5ce57c38f5-0
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.940
Stone turrets.

60722ca3-3681-4bf4-98d0-b6e6a4f22df0-0
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.885
It's the dad, the girl and the
bird. The bird seems to be

60722ca3-3681-4bf4-98d0-b6e6a4f22df0-1
00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:56.840
forward in the boat and maybe
doing the navigating.

3b27d01a-6afe-40e1-a330-48524efcdd64-0
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.410
Underneath there.

96e83992-2a7e-4201-9c96-14ec443a3070-0
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.354
It's a very capable boat. It has
a paddle wheel behind and

96e83992-2a7e-4201-9c96-14ec443a3070-1
00:11:04.354 --> 00:11:08.258
periscopes, so they're actually
the girl's watching what's going

96e83992-2a7e-4201-9c96-14ec443a3070-2
00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:09.400
on above the water.

e099cd0f-4ff2-4c8e-bdc1-9b7c271e6f31-0
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.170
They have an idea of it.

af7a0cd0-da3e-49ab-bed4-b38f0055272d-0
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.400
Who knows what will happen next.

2c652c2d-6321-41d1-ad5b-3362bde3aca0-0
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.370
OK. And they landed, they've
come to a place where?

73b0af13-e529-4772-a38a-e0a93d30b5b8-0
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.610
There's actually a cavernous
opening.

7824d326-be08-452d-9b98-654579761bbf-0
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.765
And allows them to sort of pull
up on a shore and they get out

7824d326-be08-452d-9b98-654579761bbf-1
00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:34.079
that the girl and the bird and
they're seeing cave drawings.

7824d326-be08-452d-9b98-654579761bbf-2
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.070
How beautiful.

d50b17f2-1f59-4712-ab1b-c5c50436eb4b-0
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.798
Probably an earlier
civilization, and Oh no, it's

d50b17f2-1f59-4712-ab1b-c5c50436eb4b-1
00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:44.012
there are drawings similar to
what they've been going through

d50b17f2-1f59-4712-ab1b-c5c50436eb4b-2
00:11:44.012 --> 00:11:45.780
that's really interesting.

c75ad45f-2ff4-4ec9-8a82-1381314a1854-0
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.650
Oh yeah.

7a9547b8-c7d7-40b5-867b-bb5f3d56e94a-0
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.490
OK, here's another view of that,
and there's an opening to the.

c2844891-f1e2-4d02-b64e-3b6b0e5398b7-0
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.130
To some outdoor area.

8d4e0a41-4871-4cee-8870-d57793a95a93-0
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.630
The girl though is pointing so
yeah.

57fc07f6-6f7c-4404-8b83-e8b9067b8c8a-0
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.917
It looks as though what's been
drawn on the walls is their

57fc07f6-6f7c-4404-8b83-e8b9067b8c8a-1
00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:08.110
adventure. You can't be sure of
that, but it looks pretty close.

898fc498-c3a0-424d-be75-04d0a4df5cc6-0
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.440
Bird's come looking forward to
getting out. You can see that.

d44da942-12b1-4859-8a09-05573116c9a5-0
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.201
And it's a sunny day out there.
Pretty sunny day. Little few

d44da942-12b1-4859-8a09-05573116c9a5-1
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:17.530
clouds.

b710aa28-d630-4a50-8855-6d9419cfb069-0
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.540
They're probably going to head
out.

96395dde-f0bf-4987-945f-4c337bea0f26-0
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.970
So for some reason.

e4968e87-199a-41a6-954f-9de54abcc7ee-0
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.160
The dad is drawing.

f270fe06-92d6-4c97-94ea-7388fd2a962a-0
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.410
His pencil which is.

148d4fc9-306f-4322-970b-6f8895822531-0
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.040
Gray.

483fd87e-3ccc-4849-af0c-b365841bed27-0
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.627
He draws what looks like a
doorway and with the cage for

483fd87e-3ccc-4849-af0c-b365841bed27-1
00:12:43.627 --> 00:12:46.846
the bird hanging in it, or a
seat for the bird. I can't tell

483fd87e-3ccc-4849-af0c-b365841bed27-2
00:12:46.846 --> 00:12:47.480
which it is.

a09e2481-cdcf-4168-9bd1-4d90a37d701d-0
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.080
Who knows what's next?

1f44999c-50b6-400f-8371-d12e794ec72d-0
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.090
Interesting.

fc0dfca5-2a38-467a-a327-b3248547e188-0
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.630
Oh my gosh. Fascinating. So he's
drawn it as a trap.

8d4cdcad-738a-41c8-b348-f513f671cb0c-0
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.470
To attract the soldiers when
they spot them.

1e3c22f4-c22b-4caf-9349-64a82c5eb3e8-0
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.840
They run.

b3fdeaa5-7f0c-497e-a7a5-09a77e618cfe-0
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.330
Heading for the bird.

8503250e-80cc-4560-bc46-c890b6512adf-0
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.280
And it's very clever, the doors.

b2c74cfb-140e-4721-b401-5350decbe726-0
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.990
To that little trap.

fff850c4-92fd-497f-9574-b9b9da0e16c0-0
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.945
Aren't evident until someone
gets inside and they quickly

fff850c4-92fd-497f-9574-b9b9da0e16c0-1
00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:30.220
flip up and trap them. Literally
trap them there, so the.

0dd1ed90-a7ec-40f3-9c47-18c018ac566f-0
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.510
That scary weapon weapon that
the soldier was brandishing is

0dd1ed90-a7ec-40f3-9c47-18c018ac566f-1
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.720
knocked out of his hand as the
trap closes with him inside.

cd9fdc39-6a3e-4f62-906d-f02d5bd1bf7f-0
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.850
And the dad picks it up and is
just about to destroy it.

63f7da60-a340-4986-8422-d31203930e97-0
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.990
Not sure what's happening with
bird.

68c20331-37f7-4411-b3bb-6df6ba3e1f38-0
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.130
OK Oh yeah, yeah, the bird is
turning into.

e362044e-7a10-4f07-9291-dbc4c510dcd7-0
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.080
A really threatening looking
monster.

11428110-8fef-4ed7-be51-9e07dfcc264a-0
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.190
in purple now the bird flies
off.

d9b73f8e-8311-401f-b43f-13e0dcd175a6-0
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.530
A monster is born out of the
weapon.

6150474e-99ea-4c52-a7f4-968e5101c186-0
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.180
Along with dragonflies and
butterflies.

f3b2a555-e21f-4c8f-9fc7-d6d8cdfcb4bd-0
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.600
The King and the boy.

a4678f18-bcec-4908-ba2d-c5ee53dde9f0-0
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.010
Are.

19cac88b-23e9-4104-86c4-1d2b3883787a-0
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.550
Appearing now too, on some kind
of a gold.

9682d3fa-e5ca-46cd-8d3a-ed99091008db-0
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.630
SWATH. 

0a970de3-7c92-4185-a210-336df54ad6ad-0
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.580
The other soldiers.

b38bd2e2-8080-49a8-8ec4-c88d4b188c8e-0
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.022
Are afraid of what's going on.
They realize that their comrade

b38bd2e2-8080-49a8-8ec4-c88d4b188c8e-1
00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:31.980
has been trapped and they don't
want any part of it, so they're

b38bd2e2-8080-49a8-8ec4-c88d4b188c8e-2
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.430
kind of reeling backwards and
dropping their swords.

34fe25ac-4971-4f66-bd75-fbb7c4a541f6-0
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.577
The dad's been fierce in the way
that he broke up the weapon, so

34fe25ac-4971-4f66-bd75-fbb7c4a541f6-1
00:14:39.577 --> 00:14:42.990
yeah, it's quite a scene. Don't
know what's happening next.

f0d19ac6-41cd-48a5-a984-6b86afa6a22b-0
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.460
Oh my goodness.

9c128d58-ec22-4523-ad2d-4eea16e5ca6d-0
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.940
Looks like they've won their
freedom.

039b290e-d682-4240-b2d1-60418e52b936-0
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.200
And all these multi colored
birds are flying off.

92b55962-fda8-4514-8230-389e62271093-0
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.780
With that soldier.

8d21d1bb-b244-44b1-a518-f588c080a5d9-0
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.552
Captive. taking him to jail,
probably back at the castle and

8d21d1bb-b244-44b1-a518-f588c080a5d9-1
00:15:03.552 --> 00:15:05.310
every all the threatening.

1961dbe2-5f48-4b87-a849-9259e6be4a16-0
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.600
Characters or disappearing into
the.

92001234-acc7-41c8-9b4b-8db75655ef00-0
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.620
Onto the hearth.

72549891-203a-4ab8-9303-69262a0bbaa5-0
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.000
Beyond the horizon.

d3fb89c3-e3ce-46ee-b446-0c31afc844aa-0
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.720
And the king, the two children
and the dad are there.

bcfcd06b-6def-450c-b7e4-c50a054b4f17-0
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.540
The girl's hugging her dad, so
thankful he arrived to save

bcfcd06b-6def-450c-b7e4-c50a054b4f17-1
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.860
them. They wouldn't have made
it. Probably.

c706e6b4-ed7d-4015-ac36-31b613e95e0a-0
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.310
Looks like they're going to have
a chance to go through that

c706e6b4-ed7d-4015-ac36-31b613e95e0a-1
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.410
door. Yep, end of slide show.
They're back back home.

419c3213-361a-44c7-af18-79c78fff15a7-0
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.134
Flying the kite, thankfully I
bet home never looks so good.

419c3213-361a-44c7-af18-79c78fff15a7-1
00:15:37.134 --> 00:15:37.830

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.520
Hey.

e0aa3934-69cd-412e-8cf8-d450168c6e27-0
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.410
Let me see what's next.

341b7776-70cc-4a29-9f14-d0348014e51c-0
00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:08.450


d8b80a53-6270-4402-8729-34591f4f8f48-0
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.670
OK, next we have a.

4ee02f47-0260-4d0b-85dd-1571b29deaff-0
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.000
Um, complex scene.

d98e86b0-3349-4260-b1fd-966e379e10a3-0
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:45.040


72cc527d-8851-43fa-bdd0-1baefea11925-0
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.921
And I'm going to share my screen
so with complex scenes like

72cc527d-8851-43fa-bdd0-1baefea11925-1
00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:57.100
before, just take 3 to 5 minutes
to describe the scene.

de106699-de1d-4812-a9ed-c06e5f946410-0
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.870
And let me put this into
presenting mode.

0deb2bad-9003-477e-8721-e27cfa1592fa-0
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.540
OK.

e57d5aa2-9acb-43c5-9622-17475b4ec18d-0
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.633
Well, thanks. That's helpful. No
problem. You could begin

e57d5aa2-9acb-43c5-9622-17475b4ec18d-1
00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:17.029
whenever you're ready.
#START_make_a_splash Alright, so

e57d5aa2-9acb-43c5-9622-17475b4ec18d-2
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:18.050
this story or

6dd0fe96-d116-4e3d-8703-15602774da38-0
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.060
Page.

d7c959f9-6c30-4c1e-bd84-663c0e99a837-0
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.400
Series. It's called making a
splash. {Ever since Peewee and

d7c959f9-6c30-4c1e-bd84-663c0e99a837-1
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.720
Snowflake spotted the bright
wiggly slides in the distance,

d7c959f9-6c30-4c1e-bd84-663c0e99a837-2
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.440
they've been.

0170bdfa-aa56-4953-93cb-06ea369e445e-0
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.160
Pestering to listen go to the
water park.}

13dec5ed-fd98-4b07-bd74-bebb777d81f7-0
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.333
So it it's definitely a water
park and it looks like it's

13dec5ed-fd98-4b07-bd74-bebb777d81f7-1
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:42.850
probably in New Jersey judging
from the number of people in it.

d1b28b5d-fef3-49d9-a0c0-0b6e5d7c387b-0
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.781
Or, you know, Thailand or
something. Oh my God, I've never

d1b28b5d-fef3-49d9-a0c0-0b6e5d7c387b-1
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:49.500
seen so many people in one
place.

8f4e4bee-cf9b-4be5-bde5-41486b7b9f3b-0
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.262
And the variety of people is
fascinating too. All ages,

8f4e4bee-cf9b-4be5-bde5-41486b7b9f3b-1
00:17:55.262 --> 00:18:00.953
nationalities, races, you know,
it's just a throng. There's, you

8f4e4bee-cf9b-4be5-bde5-41486b7b9f3b-2
00:18:00.953 --> 00:18:03.930
know, moms and dads and kids.
So.

9a9af94a-7bd9-4aa4-ba73-265e960ee92b-0
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.010
Everyone's.

0f24b80c-9c58-4f00-aa18-71e87361fec7-0
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.550
Swimming.

4d32b652-c3ee-41ca-8a54-a6a21b67250e-0
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:15.750
Or sliding your are some really
intricate fun water slides here.

347662ec-e286-44f3-b902-d769c3c9ef8a-0
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.829
Are full of people, some
traveling even into little

347662ec-e286-44f3-b902-d769c3c9ef8a-1
00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:24.360
tunnels as part of the
experience.

1459841e-0637-4ff0-962c-5881da79e6cf-0
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.530
And just imagine how much
squealing is going on.

2a4715d6-9cf9-426d-be21-6b2e58c2f318-0
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.724
And there are lines of people
waiting to get onto those water

2a4715d6-9cf9-426d-be21-6b2e58c2f318-1
00:18:31.724 --> 00:18:32.090
slides.

84bc7bd5-513f-43b8-9707-a75d53caa1f5-0
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.090
There are.

f1da7219-7dbf-4b72-b5c0-3b3419a06d66-0
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.000
Cute little boats, these little
yellow doughnut kind of things.

ee455707-cde1-4fe7-914f-694e24df0e65-0
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.550
That people are floating on and.

2e75cfe7-abf2-44e9-8ea5-1aa80f409685-0
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.970
in the upper, upper area.

0bc04c59-de2e-49e5-b946-0e96d17ce69f-0
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.250
And then there's a fascinating
old timey kind of a pirate ship.

af055e1e-e17d-4683-99d9-d9a3d1071f61-0
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.560
That you can get on to and
there's.

74674080-3cf2-4d7b-a177-05b79186c384-0
00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.390
Different kinds of toys and
tricks on there, as well as a a

74674080-3cf2-4d7b-a177-05b79186c384-1
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.680
giant wide water slide from the
ship down to the pools below.

cc909a9d-8304-41af-9761-7bd82de1ca89-0
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.364
That the kids are getting to to
climb the into the up to the

cc909a9d-8304-41af-9761-7bd82de1ca89-1
00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:13.641
lookouts on the ship with those
ladders, those rope ladders that

cc909a9d-8304-41af-9761-7bd82de1ca89-2
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:17.786
they used to have back in back
in the day. It's very authentic

cc909a9d-8304-41af-9761-7bd82de1ca89-3
00:19:17.786 --> 00:19:21.537
looking, but painted more
interesting colors than usual,

cc909a9d-8304-41af-9761-7bd82de1ca89-4
00:19:21.537 --> 00:19:22.130
I'm sure.

b292cd38-7bb1-42e1-a2d0-ebb6c50d7525-0
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.083
Most kids are having a great
time, they are water sliding

b292cd38-7bb1-42e1-a2d0-ebb6c50d7525-1
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:27.360
down.

c355d7b4-fe12-41b0-b21c-911cd76aa65d-0
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:34.020
Into the main pool area.
Everyone sort of arrives in the

c355d7b4-fe12-41b0-b21c-911cd76aa65d-1
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.080
center pool from all.

7e8a8c71-74c6-46c7-9252-01e86411bce5-0
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.320
Different accesses.

4e62f6f0-56a5-4eb2-b3fe-8feb6943d7c7-0
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.210
Some of them have floaty toys,
those what do they call those

9c09aa02-66ce-4185-b889-28c7f8997663-0
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.090
Noodles. Some of them have those
noodles.

47b89990-9c40-4ce5-a98d-e23317932d02-0
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:52.313
And then there's a big blow up
dragon that's actually spinning

47b89990-9c40-4ce5-a98d-e23317932d02-1
00:19:52.313 --> 00:19:53.900
water. Pretty realistic.

3c71e6d1-0dcf-498f-b7a7-12a103695f5a-0
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.580
And there's.

0b60eff3-6f83-4263-84d9-31c5d6f64298-0
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.960
Different things they can step
off. Almost looks like floating

0b60eff3-6f83-4263-84d9-31c5d6f64298-1
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.760
pieces of logs.

476dc0bc-85a6-4144-a783-d28918d2f961-0
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.510
And.

5a922192-f500-4fcd-b806-5391e3c44c13-0
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.620
There's a wonderful bridge.

04b77bf0-d758-4e80-ad5a-fedb9455b292-0
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.550
Bathing suits.

f47cd90d-9121-40d6-aca7-7c5592e6c082-0
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.580
Every color imaginable.

37a1ac61-6ef9-474f-8aa7-a7de8e1bdaa2-0
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.824
{I used to design bathing suits
for a short time. It was a lot

37a1ac61-6ef9-474f-8aa7-a7de8e1bdaa2-1
00:20:18.824 --> 00:20:19.150
of fun.}

a71495a4-97f4-4098-b65f-ccf7f79cac0b-0
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.692
There's some submerged snake
with two bulbous eyes, and the

a71495a4-97f4-4098-b65f-ccf7f79cac0b-1
00:20:28.692 --> 00:20:33.160
kids are having a great time
climbing on to the different

a71495a4-97f4-4098-b65f-ccf7f79cac0b-2
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.780
parts of the long, winding
snake.

f96f7eb0-3244-4be4-af35-9aed38c6d55e-0
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.390
There's two big polka dots
balls.

77210076-646c-4e3a-828f-d7bd83faf434-0
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.480
A green one and a red one.

a6ee6a7f-c251-4cd0-9669-4d2d8818fdd0-0
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.020
And they seem to.

1e18c324-bce6-4ef3-80e9-b5ba20e870d6-0
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.019
Maybe the umbrellas or something
that are sending water down onto

1e18c324-bce6-4ef3-80e9-b5ba20e870d6-1
00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:50.460
people.

5d81a581-d1da-4f3a-9cbf-5217b4edee40-0
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.470
Everyone under those.

561395b2-ad39-42ec-8028-3ad6a0fecd6e-0
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.970
Mushroom caps or whatever they
are, is having a good time.

c33eedbd-ba6f-4770-bad0-7daa8a0c2813-0
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.590
Ohh of course.

2851fd6c-2682-455b-ad8e-bc671929791f-0
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.468
From the bridge, that beautiful
semicircular bridge on the left

2851fd6c-2682-455b-ad8e-bc671929791f-1
00:21:06.468 --> 00:21:11.342
side, there, there's a young kid
with a water cannon shooting it

2851fd6c-2682-455b-ad8e-bc671929791f-2
00:21:11.342 --> 00:21:16.140
at a girl that he probably has a
crush on. Who knows? Oh, there

2851fd6c-2682-455b-ad8e-bc671929791f-3
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.590
are guys and girls. There are
people selling.

77ead6cf-df07-4375-8e6d-395d78fde9b8-0
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.630
You know snacks, I suppose.

f0425197-dc08-4bb2-99e6-3e3ac7200534-0
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.530
They seem to be carrying these
trays of snacks over them. Some

f0425197-dc08-4bb2-99e6-3e3ac7200534-1
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.320
people are stretching on
blankets.

b1839921-e66a-495e-b04c-783f007bf352-0
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.640
Relaxing. We've had enough of
the water. And there's a giant

b1839921-e66a-495e-b04c-783f007bf352-1
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.170
pink elephant who squirts water
out of its the end of its trunk.

7238ed4c-67f2-49c5-95a1-377bca69ed2f-0
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.038
Yeah, there couldn't be more
people there than there are at

7238ed4c-67f2-49c5-95a1-377bca69ed2f-1
00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:50.961
the moment and luckily a few
palm trees to send kind of calm

7238ed4c-67f2-49c5-95a1-377bca69ed2f-2
00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:54.370
the mood down and give it a more
natural aspect too.

618e67dc-6b18-4cea-bb80-febe96e709a1-0
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.989
But it looks like a very
successful water park. If you

618e67dc-6b18-4cea-bb80-febe96e709a1-1
00:21:56.989 --> 00:21:58.978
want to invest in a water park,
this might be the one.

618e67dc-6b18-4cea-bb80-febe96e709a1-2
00:21:58.978 --> 00:21:59.630
#END_make_a_splash

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.970
OK.

6503d554-229b-4069-a984-7a51c4691c69-0
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.430
Perfect. Now let me see what we
have next.

6cc5ee02-7cec-493f-90f0-b3acdec56488-0
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.360
OK, we have another complex
scene.

e08b2f04-80c6-4826-8db0-fcd7226a51a8-0
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.220
Hello.

a3406a57-674a-45b5-84f5-15b3a6f9b0e6-0
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.020
Pull it up.

ac49a79e-7cd1-40cf-bd32-f52b0ee7e1fc-0
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:32.990
OK.

9f8968fb-bb26-4a95-824f-6466e3abea5f-0
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.240
Same thing as before. This is
another scene.

087a3b2e-464d-4ba8-a4d3-33685c751bff-0
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.990
#START_escape_from_the_zoo And
this one's called.

814f74b0-a856-438c-ac24-d111292fcce7-0
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.749
Escape from the zoo? That sounds
frightening. {I have a nephew, a

814f74b0-a856-438c-ac24-d111292fcce7-1
00:22:44.749 --> 00:22:47.670
nephew who works in the
Melbourne FL Zoo and.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.340
This would give him a nightmare,
I'm sure.

fcd6a356-0085-449d-9b36-cadb15cb9055-0
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.590
So Oh well, what fun. Let's
see.}

e09ba2d3-2d29-4964-86d3-cab6102b1017-0
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.210
There's a city in the
background, so this is a zoo.

264f5aa7-4c1a-4d46-a611-44ff9d6ccd5c-0
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.790
That's available probably by
subway and buses and whatever.

a27b081b-91ff-47de-94ca-a3438e94494f-0
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.567
To get to for city dwellers to
go to the zoo on the weekend I'm

a27b081b-91ff-47de-94ca-a3438e94494f-1
00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:12.990
guessing.

8b2f67aa-a32f-49b3-a4c5-9ba18a435e16-0
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.640
And there's a tremendous variety
of animals from the looks of it.

de9e864e-d7a5-481f-8d3c-da2f0bb24ba5-0
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.710
Although it's unlike any zoo.

81866577-200f-42e9-8f62-051ef6da3e94-0
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.858
Most of us have ever been to
because the animals are all

81866577-200f-42e9-8f62-051ef6da3e94-1
00:23:26.858 --> 00:23:31.561
mixed in their areas. Not always
an easy thing to get away with

81866577-200f-42e9-8f62-051ef6da3e94-2
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:35.749
as a zookeeper, I'd say and and
some of them seem to be.

da565d97-1499-476c-bb72-53702051cf9c-0
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.135
Yeah, running amuck like the
rhinoceros is definitely on the

da565d97-1499-476c-bb72-53702051cf9c-1
00:23:41.135 --> 00:23:41.530
loose.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.030
And he has a Penguin, it looks
like, on his back.

aab16db4-3b83-45ff-b907-bfcbdcfc16e6-0
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.357
People are fleeing the
rhinoceros, as they probably

aab16db4-3b83-45ff-b907-bfcbdcfc16e6-1
00:23:51.357 --> 00:23:51.890
should.

fcd98ae3-a108-408a-bf9c-e462faaf43a9-0
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.880
I know now I see the kangaroo
also escaped.

db9b82af-e9e0-4ddb-9e02-5ab86812baa2-0
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.410
As well as some birds.

cf9798fb-b872-4d4e-82b4-c42a71405995-0
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.930
And there's someone, maybe the
zookeeper in a very small plane.

912f5755-2122-423b-bdbf-b1e9d0511cb7-0
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.810
Trying to steer animals back to
where they belong, I'm guessing.

0431ab13-615c-4eb5-9db0-50bc643b0c83-0
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.736
All right. And as far as the
loose animals go, one of them is

0431ab13-615c-4eb5-9db0-50bc643b0c83-1
00:24:17.736 --> 00:24:21.439
a Peacock and its tail would be
a male peacock. His tail is

0431ab13-615c-4eb5-9db0-50bc643b0c83-2
00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:24.711
completely opened. It's
beautiful. People are taking

0431ab13-615c-4eb5-9db0-50bc643b0c83-3
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:25.390
photos and.

82c94cc7-8c37-4353-b7ea-bc7ef2e25710-0
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.050
You know, like noticing it.

7a1e5c90-8cea-4baa-a17e-edf1dfc92c45-0
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.180
Oh gosh, the zookeepers.

2a3a3a62-80f5-4e18-898c-241069918683-0
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.550
Some of the people have.

d45397ec-03de-4e59-9291-7ff7bfd4a401-0
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.706
Gotten themselves into the Lions
area. Even the Lions are

d45397ec-03de-4e59-9291-7ff7bfd4a401-1
00:24:42.706 --> 00:24:43.210
shocked.

7a04058c-b78f-44ff-b944-67bd0e14fa1f-0
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.180
Even the Gopher, somehow.

652556a9-48cf-4be4-9da0-3ad04c12f144-0
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.580
Found found a little.

da589d6d-a555-4d1c-8fd3-8e037d5a555f-0
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.061
A way to get get himself above
ground through little tunnel

da589d6d-a555-4d1c-8fd3-8e037d5a555f-1
00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:58.760
finds he's next to the male
lion. Not a good idea.

ceba6115-b858-4776-9bd3-d06d077a4c1b-0
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.300
No, there's oh gosh.

951f53da-d010-4e32-abb7-0f44aa2974df-0
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.647
Snakes are amongst the runners,
but meanwhile with all that

951f53da-d010-4e32-abb7-0f44aa2974df-1
00:25:07.647 --> 00:25:09.530
peril on the lower right.

c15c1ee2-04b7-4fe7-9090-7b8d87ef1ebf-0
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.780
There are still ice cream
sellers.

2782b56d-dfe8-4ab3-9315-f5d0e704829f-0
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.259
Or hot dog. No, it's a hot dog
vendor. There are moms pushing

2782b56d-dfe8-4ab3-9315-f5d0e704829f-1
00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:20.779
their babies, all heading in
that direction, not realizing

2782b56d-dfe8-4ab3-9315-f5d0e704829f-2
00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:24.597
how insane things are ahead of
them. So moving backward, moving

2782b56d-dfe8-4ab3-9315-f5d0e704829f-3
00:25:24.597 --> 00:25:25.969

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.702
In the exciting area now going
backward. Oh, there's a really

4c36f8e1-edb3-4727-95be-8f8db1255e9d-1
00:25:30.702 --> 00:25:33.740
lovely grandfather. There are
babies in strollers.

82e8163a-2752-4915-afb9-b0d84ff2101e-0
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.460
And then there are the
zookeepers. And they're wearing

82e8163a-2752-4915-afb9-b0d84ff2101e-1
00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.870
khaki outfits and have butterfly
Nets or bird catching nets. I

82e8163a-2752-4915-afb9-b0d84ff2101e-2
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.270
guess they might be.

b06ac24a-b319-4fdd-ab23-88c158ffee54-0
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.250
That's pretty interesting. Oh
boy, there's someone feeding.

93f8a954-f9f0-403b-b2ea-934d84d6919a-0
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:54.044
Potato chips or something to the
animals. Absolute wrong thing to

93f8a954-f9f0-403b-b2ea-934d84d6919a-1
00:25:54.044 --> 00:25:54.660
be doing.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.330
Something's in the trees above

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.815
coatimundi, I think that is. And
there are birds in the trees.

d020e537-0040-49d4-ae82-aef39be5eefd-1
00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:09.350
There are polar bears.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:17.251
Elephants, ostriches, eagle.
There's an eagle on the rooftop

e0280dc7-a93b-4676-928c-75b8c365bb13-1
00:26:17.251 --> 00:26:21.453
and a stork on another one and
then in the upper right. Keep

e0280dc7-a93b-4676-928c-75b8c365bb13-2
00:26:21.453 --> 00:26:24.759

beginning down below.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.460
Upper right are all the
primates, the gorillas,

2dad362e-0380-4c75-800b-30cbba9fbc26-0
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.580
Gorilla family. A big gorilla
family.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.110

00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:44.520
movements.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.960
having a good time. There's a
shop and a cafe.

3291d06f-8cc0-4952-ba3a-ab891fbdddc5-0
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.520
Zebras are beautiful. There's a
zebra pair. Flamingos.

And then that little thing.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.640
Ice cream seller and the crowd.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.747
Yeah, it's one crazy day at the
zoo and escape from the zoo I

9e164774-26b8-4b07-9e63-f359501b6b91-1
00:27:14.747 --> 00:27:18.118

trying to do as much as the

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.120
OK, NEXT is another complex
scene.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.710
Same thing as before.

816dd18a-ec4b-4f00-9fba-be6fb8de21ab-0
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.650
You gave us more.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.320
#STRAT_deep_sea_divers So, deep
sea divers.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.470
Still haven't found Waldo. Why
don't I ever see Waldo?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.910
Well, anyway.

655b43d1-e7b9-46d7-819f-26aba2f2c2e4-0
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:24.658
I've never seen so many boats,
and certainly never so many

655b43d1-e7b9-46d7-819f-26aba2f2c2e4-1
00:28:24.658 --> 00:28:27.620
striped boats as we're seeing
here and.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.150
They look rather old fashioned.

a7454aad-1c21-45b5-b96c-6a16135ba3aa-0
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.711
Like a pirate ship with a
striped sail and a banner flying

a7454aad-1c21-45b5-b96c-6a16135ba3aa-1
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:35.120
above it.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.530
And there's some fishing going
on.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.420
Someone who's actually.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.740

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.370

people.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.610
Preparing to deep sea dive.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.390
And a lot of people fishing.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.040
As usual.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.072
There's a crush of people in
this thing as you look down

0530cfc1-1294-44ae-81f2-2cbb69c3bce7-1
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:02.190

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.470
Pillows tied to them, which must
be some kind of a flotation.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.370

Fish.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.460
Who's caught

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.420

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.709
There's no way the person in
that little boat is going to be

00:29:32.709 --> 00:29:33.450
able to haul them up.

ea26bdf4-031f-4ab6-8cf9-708acc27c0d0-0
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.665
There are sea snakes, I think is
what I'm seeing there, the green

ea26bdf4-031f-4ab6-8cf9-708acc27c0d0-1
00:29:38.665 --> 00:29:39.970
ones on the far right.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.156
But they can't be too
threatening because people are

e76c7d3a-77e7-4c3e-809e-ddd1e0ef6364-1
00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:43.800

All of the free sea creatures we
see here.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.420
Fish. There's a fish with a net
just about to catch a person.

bffa2d89-24e2-4dc4-af36-0939888c36c6-0
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:54.440

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.510

himself against getting caught.

their way down to the.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.930

water.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.294

bottom, there's an octopus and

617d87cf-fc20-47b4-84f6-cfacded7477c-1
00:30:58.294 --> 00:31:01.857
some kind of a sea sloth. From
what it looks like, there's

617d87cf-fc20-47b4-84f6-cfacded7477c-2
00:31:01.857 --> 00:31:02.220
coral.

which is probably a another kind

e7e190e5-869e-4a1d-b593-0339ebd2277b-1
00:31:06.969 --> 00:31:08.960

c7bfcf90-a09c-415a-ab5c-f8c7a3662017-1
00:32:11.123 --> 00:32:12.420
scenes have been.

b879d3cd-c685-4d7b-b09b-b3f7030ae789-0
00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:18.277
There are people and animals and
everything seems to be going

b879d3cd-c685-4d7b-b09b-b3f7030ae789-1
00:32:18.277 --> 00:32:18.610
awry.

63f659f7-3fd4-45f9-ab12-47628cc5c63e-0
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.800
Gladiators was probably the
nature of the people there.

3f60d33d-dec9-43f6-b583-9ec673a1b25d-0
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:26.170
but

6bab459d-9d4b-4dd8-9f6e-b9af142e53ae-0
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.240
At the at the top here.

4b227541-f9fc-4aeb-aef5-bcde603613ee-0
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.630
On the left, you see that the
Lions are getting creative and

4b227541-f9fc-4aeb-aef5-bcde603613ee-1
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.218
they've actually made a make.
They're making a pyramid out of

4b227541-f9fc-4aeb-aef5-bcde603613ee-2
00:32:37.218 --> 00:32:40.460
themselves so that they can get
up into the arena area.

e4629085-8190-4330-8f8d-0be6dd2ed182-0
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.170
And attack people.

5351a357-5d23-436c-9f8c-98d4d6f00ca9-0
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.264
As if there aren't enough down
below, but maybe the ones up

5351a357-5d23-436c-9f8c-98d4d6f00ca9-1
00:32:48.264 --> 00:32:51.623
above look more tasty, I don't
know. Or they're annoying the

5351a357-5d23-436c-9f8c-98d4d6f00ca9-2
00:32:51.623 --> 00:32:52.780
lions, more possible.

a47d0827-283b-4bcf-8eda-cd7e877cf137-0
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.250
So there are.

538904ba-e9e7-4710-8601-6047a272396d-0
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.810
Guards with Shields and swords.

ebfe085a-b681-4c73-af72-3566d9fb7b95-0
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:06.013
And those crazy helmets they
wore back in the time of Rome,

ebfe085a-b681-4c73-af72-3566d9fb7b95-1
00:33:06.013 --> 00:33:06.920
Ancient Rome.

7903574e-82be-465a-b286-02bffffa0935-0
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.280
There are teams of horses and
Chariots.

b368c606-0281-4402-96cc-0e7bb56f1cfd-0
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.778
There are people with Tridents,
which you usually see in

b368c606-0281-4402-96cc-0e7bb56f1cfd-1
00:33:15.778 --> 00:33:17.030
connection with.

59b7005b-9447-4859-881d-f39c2f49a196-0
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.906
Defending ourselves at sea, but
here they're being used just

59b7005b-9447-4859-881d-f39c2f49a196-1
00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:26.785
kind of randomly and there are
some beautiful leopards running

59b7005b-9447-4859-881d-f39c2f49a196-2
00:33:26.785 --> 00:33:28.510
and actually chasing people.

19391719-ca93-49d1-869e-813abb3f1b88-0
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.290
Probably getting ready to eat a
few.

e37c8496-befc-44c1-832c-186f7aca3457-0
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.300
Now it's.

83f85b9e-0aa2-45a0-aa4e-dbd779bc6e82-0
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.677
Again, I'm working for my iPad
so the details a little hard to

83f85b9e-0aa2-45a0-aa4e-dbd779bc6e82-1
00:33:38.677 --> 00:33:42.365
get in some of these here in the
front, whether people are

83f85b9e-0aa2-45a0-aa4e-dbd779bc6e82-2
00:33:42.365 --> 00:33:45.490
actually being eaten or just,
you know, bothered.

ffe8612c-3fce-4e60-a0b9-6e33fcd6531a-0
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.526
Not seeing blood flowing,
although there is a lot of red,

ffe8612c-3fce-4e60-a0b9-6e33fcd6531a-1
00:33:50.526 --> 00:33:53.490
but I don't know. Yeah, there's
some chaos.

7b3e3c5e-c00c-4bfe-8cf0-58c3d69fd5ec-0
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.170
From animal attacks it looks
like.

c617f2b7-d3e3-44d0-b921-039864d239c0-0
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.690
And people attempting to get out
of.

7a95abd2-a465-483b-8549-8f8d9bc1537b-0
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:11.209
This lower arena and they're
using each other as stepping

7a95abd2-a465-483b-8549-8f8d9bc1537b-1
00:34:11.209 --> 00:34:15.240
stones to get up above and
escape.

8b1986d1-eb77-4af0-96cc-d2a6a0b95f47-0
00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:19.370
Yeah, more lions are being
released.

87bb77ee-de6a-4440-82f2-66a7e39cf24d-0
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.710
Into the arena.

90fc687f-d547-4eb7-b9b5-bc07617dd154-0
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.050
Not the kind of place you want
to spend any time.

a1709b79-f552-44db-9b42-77428130b9f2-0
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.899
But the audience is massive.
Massive number of people down

a1709b79-f552-44db-9b42-77428130b9f2-1
00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:34.630
there, gesturing with their
arms.

68e963f9-a442-4312-b85c-cee298e5f607-0
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.110
Trying to.

4d848ce4-b77c-49c6-b32c-15faf152117d-0
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.563
Tell people where the danger is.
Maybe. Oh, I see a tiger now

4d848ce4-b77c-49c6-b32c-15faf152117d-1
00:34:41.563 --> 00:34:44.970
another tiger. So we have leped
leopards. Tigers.

34db6bef-ca50-403a-a559-ec38d35e7c6d-0
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.250
Male lions. I don't see any
female lions.

ba779c1f-abef-4385-a6ca-c00aee63bb75-0
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.480
And.

f66e68c7-bba4-4fd9-bc0c-2bf42d17844f-0
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.830
Gladiators who are in a terrible
state of affairs.

c7fa556b-31fa-4cdb-80f8-b3af7d69017b-0
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.050
Who knows how it's turning out?

f56d4632-791a-4152-8d61-23057ce2fd04-0
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.770
I think that's as much as I can
narrate. 

711a7838-f9d5-4657-b567-61fe41b3188d-0
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:08.520
of it. #END_ancient_rome

1bdd1a1a-3630-4e9e-8331-f2c9e95821d6-0
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.530
OK, next one is a short story.

e517b156-2041-4520-a798-e65c7d16ae31-0
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:35.570

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.890
OK.

64e99abd-3c35-4d4c-9928-d6e9ecbd47d0-0
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.201
So when you want me to move on
from each page, just let me

64e99abd-3c35-4d4c-9928-d6e9ecbd47d0-1
00:35:47.201 --> 00:35:47.480
know.

4fd67adf-c3d1-409f-8072-111f8c53a6bd-0
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.630
Alrighty. Thanks, Megan.

b79657bd-abc8-4194-a868-671a5a6bb70d-0
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:55.930
#START_flowerman So it's it's
evening night time here in a.

ee8caf1e-2dfd-418a-b687-e8560f94c1a0-0
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.328
In a very old-fashioned village,
it's obviously Europe and

ee8caf1e-2dfd-418a-b687-e8560f94c1a0-1
00:36:00.328 --> 00:36:00.780
there's.

6f2acd56-26ba-43b5-b683-33d79f1d23ff-0
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.680
River again.

3689f1bd-4177-4545-919c-5e2ca814f45d-0
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.049
It's a little hard to make out
the river. It looks as though

3689f1bd-4177-4545-919c-5e2ca814f45d-1
00:36:08.049 --> 00:36:11.200
the river might have drained.
Yeah, that's what we're seeing.

84945264-e1a5-44b3-be9e-b01b1f27a1c9-0
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.260
And.

0d9c95a0-a3c7-4591-ac1c-49393fa0be05-0
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.820
Someone, probably a fellow, is
walking his dog.

04974377-cc47-4e8a-bb80-141616e5e59b-0
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.770
Over the bridge.

89f9e923-4d47-4346-9894-03d0d348c36b-0
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.550
Which is lit by Street lights.

b1992e05-c18d-4cbc-8c6a-ad178c629fca-0
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:26.910
And noticing.

ef35d928-91de-4844-82a9-c56d2f3102d5-0
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.545
But the rivers gone, all the
water in the river's gone.

ef35d928-91de-4844-82a9-c56d2f3102d5-1
00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:35.275
There's a car that had evidently
been lost into the river, and

ef35d928-91de-4844-82a9-c56d2f3102d5-2
00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:38.768
the dock on the other side just
sticking up there. There's

ef35d928-91de-4844-82a9-c56d2f3102d5-3
00:36:38.768 --> 00:36:40.129
another little rowboat.

7810cbfd-562c-4f0b-88e7-2eea63b6821e-0
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:41.880
And an anchor.

73949282-2d6f-4ab1-850d-e0a7ea30f4b1-0
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.870
In the bottom of that river bed,
now that it's all exposed.

c2bc95d1-e894-47ed-b969-85f194fc1681-0
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.553
Who knows where the river's
gone? And interest

c2bc95d1-e894-47ed-b969-85f194fc1681-1
00:36:49.553 --> 00:36:53.657
Interestingly, there appears to
be a circus over to the left of

c2bc95d1-e894-47ed-b969-85f194fc1681-2
00:36:53.657 --> 00:36:54.940
this little village.

5e0c5a4d-a3e8-4bc2-8df8-94069318be7d-0
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.820
It's winter time because there
are no leaves on the trees, and

5e0c5a4d-a3e8-4bc2-8df8-94069318be7d-1
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.640
whoever's crossing the bridge is
wearing a hat and a coat.

34f96956-92d8-4f12-8d59-c11242640da3-0
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.510
There's a little gas station
ahead.

3865f747-66a9-4c7d-a1ac-9f07a807851b-0
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:11.473
There's a bar and a bait shop of
all things, so this is a coastal

3865f747-66a9-4c7d-a1ac-9f07a807851b-1
00:37:11.473 --> 00:37:12.920
village, probably.

d76f3cba-9663-4090-bc68-d2e47b8de827-0
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.520
Umm.

72c0e634-3693-4595-8a70-f028ebdfaba1-0
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.740
And someone approaching.

bcc814b3-2e92-433b-9e38-8126bc09ecf9-0
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.870
Walking along the other side of
the river there.

d1381734-60ac-4cbf-a438-f4416c9ce4be-0
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.470
Little truck parked.

3ef251a5-beab-4487-a15e-32547dfbad72-0
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.787
Charming smoke coming out of a
chimney. All the chimneys smoke

3ef251a5-beab-4487-a15e-32547dfbad72-1
00:37:32.787 --> 00:37:35.560
coming out, so it's definitely
fall or winter.

6eb8605d-1aff-4817-bb7a-0d67b34eac27-0
00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.820
Yep. Don't know what's going to
happen next.

02da12c9-ef28-43fe-ae81-62d5c65aa691-0
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.191
OK, all right. It's a fellow and
walking his dog, even though

02da12c9-ef28-43fe-ae81-62d5c65aa691-1
00:37:45.191 --> 00:37:45.500
it's.

fa3a2d01-ff4b-435f-b564-9f39ceb6403f-0
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.960
Not too clear and I think maybe
he has an umbrella.

5d2015ce-420a-4a25-bb9a-023362542351-0
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.820
OK, there are.

29199819-6b74-4b84-8a0f-aef34ce897d5-0
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.226
People in windows. So he's
getting into the town square

29199819-6b74-4b84-8a0f-aef34ce897d5-1
00:37:58.226 --> 00:37:59.600
from having been at the.

21d782dc-552c-40f0-b6fa-27c3edffe610-0
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.642
The Riverside. There's a cafe
ahead. It's all lit up and there

21d782dc-552c-40f0-b6fa-27c3edffe610-1
00:38:03.642 --> 00:38:05.670
appear to be people in all the
rooms.

f2ddb554-028f-42d5-abcf-afe42ffd1b4f-0
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:11.855
There are wonderful little
porches and there's a couple, I

f2ddb554-028f-42d5-abcf-afe42ffd1b4f-1
00:38:11.855 --> 00:38:16.253
think, on this porch or no.
Maybe it's one person with it's

f2ddb554-028f-42d5-abcf-afe42ffd1b4f-2
00:38:16.253 --> 00:38:16.840
the cat.

80688ebf-59f0-4f3c-a7c2-6973decea694-0
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.460
Someone's driving through town
in a truck or a car.

d0638291-945e-4c1b-820d-3691e86ad584-0
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.833
Someone loitering under a street
lamp at the cafe entrance, and

d0638291-945e-4c1b-820d-3691e86ad584-1
00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:27.940
there's a couple.

f7af29d6-ba9b-4e09-af61-5c9be75d472d-0
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.150
Looking on.

9b1b230a-13c1-44ec-aeeb-ba4def1adab9-0
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.020
Sitting. Maybe outdoors.

964f9b0d-fdbe-4602-911c-8787d85de40a-0
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.790
Yeah, it's a charming city, very
old architecture.

bb7173db-979c-449f-8f9a-46bfd1f2b42e-0
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.310
And even though heat is on in
all the buildings.

ff282d00-09bb-462d-8e5a-f4f14b2e2092-0
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:42.470
No.

3f804675-0da3-4426-83f8-3f4d85bb3e18-0
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.590
Yeah, it's definitely fall or
winter, but there are some of

3f804675-0da3-4426-83f8-3f4d85bb3e18-1
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.644
the windows appear to be open.
OK, and the fellow arrives at a

3f804675-0da3-4426-83f8-3f4d85bb3e18-2
00:38:52.644 --> 00:38:54.060
little house for sale.

b503b603-49b2-4b5c-a4f9-0bdd77601cdd-0
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.211
The garden's all overgrown, and
the house looks like it's in

b503b603-49b2-4b5c-a4f9-0bdd77601cdd-1
00:38:59.211 --> 00:38:59.700
disrepair.

1bfeaa1d-1edd-4f61-821b-81894a4cc43f-0
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:06.489
It's a heavily settled
neighborhood, very old kind of

1bfeaa1d-1edd-4f61-821b-81894a4cc43f-1
00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:07.680
crazy buildings.

2cd85d5e-63ab-41c4-9c7a-c4c98c79dce7-0
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.228
The roofs all have slopes and
they are rickety looking,

2cd85d5e-63ab-41c4-9c7a-c4c98c79dce7-1
00:39:11.228 --> 00:39:12.150
beautiful stonework.

567a8ba8-1fe6-417c-9864-cd45b1fe0111-0
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.910
More people out doing things
even though it's night time.

c598887c-751e-4db6-920b-5361dd4112be-0
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.120
People having conversations.

f8575499-6a22-46f0-98d1-56becc1246d6-0
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.240
Looks like there's an artist at
work one of these.

ebf14d96-dd94-4705-bc2e-e7bf5729ba06-0
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.490
OK and then.

83dd0745-0916-4d63-b3fc-d25aaddc49f9-0
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.040
Morning comes. {ohh yeah, sorry
there.

519db7ca-d9a1-4e94-9403-27501c96a1e4-0
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.020
Yeah, no problem.}

5fba72ba-3ea5-4b5e-ba7d-b8601c7d463d-0
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:52.170
And Oh my gosh, he's bought the
house and is fixing it up.

1d7c0b90-e9ae-456b-af6f-a3cee126188f-0
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.980
We're looking at a daytime scene
and it's in a really busy area.

c7afd7aa-9f06-4997-b055-22dcac88f9df-0
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:58.970
Sweet little city.

47f9ab22-46ef-4132-b0d8-0d8acca1fe6e-0
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.310
So many people involved in doing
things.

f765a19a-ed93-4ee4-9609-8d89f68954f3-0
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.110
A milk delivery man.

20026331-cc5c-4fdc-8551-3b70a97bd8ee-0
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.040
Shoppers. people commuting to
work on scooters.

25777a24-5a85-41ad-b1bc-71a0bc8cf5e9-0
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.846
Very unusual looking people.
There's a Coca-Cola sign there,

25777a24-5a85-41ad-b1bc-71a0bc8cf5e9-1
00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:18.746
even though it appears to be
Europe, but we all know

25777a24-5a85-41ad-b1bc-71a0bc8cf5e9-2
00:40:18.746 --> 00:40:20.770
Coca-Cola is drunk around the
world.

d3a29438-b5ab-46cd-ad55-55b020568fbd-0
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:22.680
Unfortunately.

924dd4cc-cbed-4f45-bc96-100e4e2431d3-0
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:25.290
For all of us.

b98feb76-c260-46f8-97f0-a0a5de1ae275-0
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.292
From one of the higher
buildings, there's a a telescope

b98feb76-c260-46f8-97f0-a0a5de1ae275-1
00:40:31.292 --> 00:40:31.610
set.

64eeba39-72c1-447b-8f1e-8daee4602551-0
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.845
On what looks like a ship's
bridge at the very top of one of

64eeba39-72c1-447b-8f1e-8daee4602551-1
00:40:36.845 --> 00:40:37.590
the houses.

30f96f24-ee00-4598-8182-46cc5b67c769-0
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:45.037
Oh, so this fellow is at work
repairing a a shutter at the

30f96f24-ee00-4598-8182-46cc5b67c769-1
00:40:45.037 --> 00:40:48.140
moment, and there's a beautiful
tree.

45fccb93-b067-487a-9c45-840648832b68-0
00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:52.119
Shading his house. Then there's
something that looks like a

45fccb93-b067-487a-9c45-840648832b68-1
00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:55.628
leopard on one part of his roof
at the very point there. I have

45fccb93-b067-487a-9c45-840648832b68-2
00:40:55.628 --> 00:40:56.780
no idea what that is.

16a13d01-5486-4be5-965a-20db91da5f03-0
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.190
He's bringing the house back to
life again. Very nice to see.

07443695-7096-4ff7-a0aa-da8824576d48-0
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.280
OK, yeah, I'm still seeing that
leopard there flowering tree.

266ea3f8-7680-4756-91a0-dedf9587b164-0
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:17.004
And the fence is done. The
fellow has finished his work,

266ea3f8-7680-4756-91a0-dedf9587b164-1
00:41:17.004 --> 00:41:17.690
and he's.

c8645dc6-bf95-439b-b0f9-6ac2275f16e4-0
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:21.699
He's becoming a a lovely
neighbor from the looks of it. I

c8645dc6-bf95-439b-b0f9-6ac2275f16e4-1
00:41:21.699 --> 00:41:24.780
see him waving as someone
passing on a motor scooter.

efa8c6fe-f2b8-421b-8c9f-b65bdf206ca5-0
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.360
And down the road, also in
Multicolor, is a young girl with

efa8c6fe-f2b8-421b-8c9f-b65bdf206ca5-1
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.110
a ponytail.

aad5d833-c7e4-47a8-8148-a73e78c8033c-0
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:37.319
Heading off, we're seeing a lot
of the same characters and it's

aad5d833-c7e4-47a8-8148-a73e78c8033c-1
00:41:37.319 --> 00:41:41.190
definitely an artist in the
second story there with the the

aad5d833-c7e4-47a8-8148-a73e78c8033c-2
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.610
curved window opening.

5309f4ca-3f20-461a-90c1-f49fe426d092-0
00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.430
Kids. A few kids in the area,
which is nice to see.

3bcc7bc6-522d-427b-ac3c-53ef1ec09114-0
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:53.046
Parents lot of activity. It's
probably afternoon from looks of

3bcc7bc6-522d-427b-ac3c-53ef1ec09114-1
00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:53.250
it.

81fcc153-96d3-49d6-a683-6826fd9d9925-0
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.340
OK, that's all I've got for
that.

38646711-3d3e-4006-a883-2ee8ce38c080-0
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.560
And.

9534d4e9-eddd-47d9-914e-fa0745b2efb6-0
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.700
Movers.

ffd10142-d90d-4e7f-9d4d-4723bd0ba1f2-0
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.281
All right, someone appears to be
leaving the house next door.

ffd10142-d90d-4e7f-9d4d-4723bd0ba1f2-1
00:42:11.281 --> 00:42:12.130
Maybe, yeah.

1dd28535-63c8-445a-895b-ad676b5de98a-0
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.830
Because there's a girl is very
sad upstairs window.

25ef32cb-88f2-4659-b174-5125482e51d0-0
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:19.820
Her neighbors are moving.

dc673cad-dea7-4c6d-a663-2877c992faa6-0
00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:24.016
I might be wrong about that, but
neighbors appear to be moving

dc673cad-dea7-4c6d-a663-2877c992faa6-1
00:42:24.016 --> 00:42:24.230
out.

9cd52280-5abe-4a3b-98af-fb422c9e6d79-0
00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.140
And meanwhile, the fellow who's
moved in.

8360f969-063b-4565-9125-9a0403567678-0
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.720
Is getting to know people.

91787d08-052b-437a-b077-f8fdc42f47a8-0
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:38.200
The neighborhood's coming to
life. Color's in more areas.

cb6168de-1521-4e90-93e9-8bc1f3559361-0
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.377
There's always a fellow in an
upstairs window watching

cb6168de-1521-4e90-93e9-8bc1f3559361-1
00:42:43.377 --> 00:42:46.570
everything that's going on. He
must be retired.

d44ebdb0-6bd7-4737-a2b6-13c63592cda1-0
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.320
He needs a part time job.

7747393f-e941-4af9-b4dc-273c5ab34b6a-0
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.760
But it's a lively village.

9cbac146-e50f-4c34-85bb-93e2a04b2228-0
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:53.790
Yeah.

4d4b88f0-f240-4b8f-9e35-23407d737de0-0
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.390
Things are coming to life.

12df9197-21a0-4e67-9db6-98d7f4a32e67-0
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:11.620
So an adorable little car coming
into view.

36633f07-acf0-4a90-b17c-d4961d3acf15-0
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.824
And the artist has finished the
painting. He's wearing his

36633f07-acf0-4a90-b17c-d4961d3acf15-1
00:43:16.824 --> 00:43:17.270
beret.

4cdc87f5-5dac-439f-a0ce-92d9dc22c590-0
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.710
Oh my gosh, all the roofs.

c870f32f-afea-4f31-ac29-b05da5d26f94-0
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.100
Are colored and there's some
beautiful.

9fec17d2-4b03-40eb-ab1c-9c29baf5650a-0
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.710
Multi colored tiles on some of
them.

f03be4ac-01c5-4000-b1de-a8f78624d7dc-0
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.280
This is a very old village, but
it's being lived in and taken

f03be4ac-01c5-4000-b1de-a8f78624d7dc-1
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.320
care of from the looks of
things.

0f1c5c8e-cd10-43c4-9ef0-5b7df705f876-0
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.980
And young boy's.

8f8fd2df-a45a-4fbb-be29-2dc8427acb76-0
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.230
Gotten into the fountain, he
can't resist.

46f8f8ce-c5ed-4847-a2bb-df18b30a83a5-0
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:42.830
Add oh.

a124c1cf-792f-4bd1-8853-6fad7c85e433-0
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.760
Someone's selling artwork on the
sidewalk.

072a1319-c6db-44e2-95dd-1e72c30bab6f-0
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.892
Maybe by the artist upstairs.
Can't really tell. The fellow in

072a1319-c6db-44e2-95dd-1e72c30bab6f-1
00:43:52.892 --> 00:43:56.440
the window is still in the
window and I wish I could see.

9bc49523-be00-4982-8f0e-ea05f262d1b2-0
00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.680
What's going on? He's got
something in front of him there.

9bc49523-be00-4982-8f0e-ea05f262d1b2-1
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.270
Almost looks like a camera. I'm
not sure. Oh my goodness, years

9bc49523-be00-4982-8f0e-ea05f262d1b2-2
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.999
have gone by.

4e9c89bb-bbfa-46fc-b9e0-c993ab6c897d-0
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.470
And the fellow who repaired the
house.

fce3c449-8bae-48de-9f63-052e8a4782c6-0
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.930
Is much older.

2e943129-fb7b-4163-95bc-0126bd605238-0
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.540
it appears or.

2c8fef3b-6ffc-45de-9672-56bff1b9806d-0
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.836
There's an older gentleman there
now, and his wife, and it looks

2c8fef3b-6ffc-45de-9672-56bff1b9806d-1
00:44:17.836 --> 00:44:19.220
like their grandchild.

708912c6-bd56-437d-a546-382aecf24c2c-0
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.242
And there's this very
interesting little girl with red

708912c6-bd56-437d-a546-382aecf24c2c-1
00:44:23.242 --> 00:44:26.899
hair and glasses. It's been in
the last few of these, and she's

708912c6-bd56-437d-a546-382aecf24c2c-2
00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:30.499
talking to a fellow who's being
pushed in a wheelchair because

708912c6-bd56-437d-a546-382aecf24c2c-3
00:44:30.499 --> 00:44:33.984
he's got a broken leg and people
have been signing his cast.

708912c6-bd56-437d-a546-382aecf24c2c-4
00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:36.670
Maybe she's asking if she can
too. Very sweet.

9674d1bf-3bed-48a8-ab22-a7dac678114c-0
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.804
The milkman is dancing with Ohh
the young girl with the

9674d1bf-3bed-48a8-ab22-a7dac678114c-1
00:44:40.804 --> 00:44:43.495
ponytail. Yep, this is
definitely years on. She's

9674d1bf-3bed-48a8-ab22-a7dac678114c-2
00:44:43.495 --> 00:44:46.833
growing up and now the milkman
and she are dancing out in the

9674d1bf-3bed-48a8-ab22-a7dac678114c-3
00:44:46.833 --> 00:44:47.210
square.

f4fa4bcd-079e-45b7-8db3-bf2f322c723b-0
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.510
There is a guitarist.

860d53a8-cba9-47b1-acca-c9a9c2eddc4a-0
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.200
And people on a roof. A man on a
roof with his kids.

78324064-bac8-4514-86ab-0c699407a7e4-0
00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.580
I keep seeing that fire hydrant.

1cc2e07e-ede7-4167-a517-87c093de1a6e-0
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.140
Yeah, there are a lot of
generations here. It's lovely.

034273c4-e483-493a-a449-6c6f3cab9b18-0
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.740
Kids in the foreground, 3 boys.

ce5f8308-7b5e-4249-9d42-cfabe67c81fd-0
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.750
And a dog. They appear to be
friendly.

a7987b09-6ae2-40d3-bcbc-ddd3248ff0d3-0
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.980
With each other getting to know
one another maybe?

6fd4345d-ae16-4b57-99b6-1390781621ac-0
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.540
Yeah, looks like a lovely town.

571c9f79-b715-4f1c-9668-823938898d79-0
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.030
That's all I've got. Women
chatting. That's sweet.

588b48bc-7513-4ff3-9119-96e14942f77a-0
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.970
{OK. I guess next one.

a6855613-9bcc-4a19-a0bb-64346e3fdb75-0
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:36.123
Oh, is this it? Yeah. OK, this
is the next one. Sometimes when

a6855613-9bcc-4a19-a0bb-64346e3fdb75-1
00:45:36.123 --> 00:45:39.909
you switch it, I don't see the
switch. It's weird. And so

a6855613-9bcc-4a19-a0bb-64346e3fdb75-2
00:45:39.909 --> 00:45:43.761
yeah.} Oh my goodness. So yeah,
time probably has moved on

a6855613-9bcc-4a19-a0bb-64346e3fdb75-3
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:44.480
again. And.

3d5ce741-be60-45af-a7a5-c0b611ea8e23-0
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.463
For several oh, it's not a
leopard chimney on that

3d5ce741-be60-45af-a7a5-c0b611ea8e23-1
00:45:49.463 --> 00:45:53.690
beautiful little house. It's a
chimney set with stones that

3d5ce741-be60-45af-a7a5-c0b611ea8e23-2
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.846
look like leopard spots. And
it's fall, the tree's turning

3d5ce741-be60-45af-a7a5-c0b611ea8e23-3
00:45:57.846 --> 00:45:58.339
colors.

2c9c945a-a1f6-4a53-8f6a-736a82df5425-0
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:00.180
Umm.

288c3658-c42f-4bc5-bc86-761a56c1af6f-0
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.410
I don't see the the man who
fixed that house up.

c8cba08b-9d0f-4aef-9472-9be24f65bf19-0
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.754
But the house is still in
beautiful shape. Someone's

c8cba08b-9d0f-4aef-9472-9be24f65bf19-1
00:46:09.754 --> 00:46:10.450
caring for it.

3378bfa6-f30e-4ca8-a6d7-f869f5706378-0
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.980
And there may be someone in bed
upstairs, I can't tell.

6a05c6db-d87a-4db8-baab-579f953f1456-0
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.070
And this little cart.

10b06143-2d37-405e-bc15-ca27b4a5dc93-0
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.150
Is like.

bea5faa8-00a5-4839-9a07-84d1f5a13ead-0
00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.820
Selling flowers, apparently.
Something like that.

f5f0ad00-3a68-40aa-9da0-5e60fcb435e5-0
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:25.130
Wow.

49a2eae7-6976-4bce-acc6-543f24c91df5-0
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.578
Here in the foreground, I can't
believe it. The fellow with this

49a2eae7-6976-4bce-acc6-543f24c91df5-1
00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:32.823
leg in a cast with signatures on
it still has his leg in the

49a2eae7-6976-4bce-acc6-543f24c91df5-2
00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:35.750
cast, so this might just be
another day, I don't know.

44b5bd9c-eeaa-4b30-b061-49a81bf94c3f-0
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.710
Hard to tell.

04f3ff85-e91a-4909-b88c-745614f47da5-0
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.410
Oh yeah. There's the gentleman
who fixed the house up with his

04f3ff85-e91a-4909-b88c-745614f47da5-1
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.800
wife. They've been out walking.
Very sweet.

47493c92-ea74-43a7-8a3f-74d1792b69c2-0
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:49.100
And the artist is not in his
studio.

fcc63648-030d-46d3-a8d8-bcde1bbeb13a-0
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.803
And the fellow who's always in
his window watching things is

fcc63648-030d-46d3-a8d8-bcde1bbeb13a-1
00:46:53.803 --> 00:46:57.416
not there. This is a very unique
day. There are two important

fcc63648-030d-46d3-a8d8-bcde1bbeb13a-2
00:46:57.416 --> 00:46:58.289
people missing.

9603d8f7-8a5a-4ec9-9260-74d79f20c392-0
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.236
There's the fellow. Maybe the
fellow who's always been

9603d8f7-8a5a-4ec9-9260-74d79f20c392-1
00:47:04.236 --> 00:47:04.940
looking.

e82bcfee-3b0d-4073-9ab0-fa18bf4e3d96-0
00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.690
Is on a rooftop wearing a towel.

4eded8bf-f684-4023-8e57-c3741199db14-0
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.410
Maybe he's.

d0a71a41-1be0-4793-8c4a-8e1e6efa04bd-0
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.620
Been getting some sun.

2b9e1e78-4720-4be1-a3cc-040c06d14e33-0
00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.560
Hard to say.

9db345ae-3dfa-4916-a3ed-01d6148df950-0
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:19.250
And there's a dad and his
daughter, it looks like.

fbf7b9aa-427b-433d-81cd-68c00921b13b-0
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:21.920
All the windows are open.

0e9fa58b-0272-40b7-8e6e-4feb3aa40bfa-0
00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.784
Fewer people on the street. They
all seem to be moving in One

0e9fa58b-0272-40b7-8e6e-4feb3aa40bfa-1
00:47:26.784 --> 00:47:27.230
Direction.

3a0ad29a-3989-41f6-9c71-ffd259a99dc3-0
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.898
Ohh my gosh I wonder. So the
milk truck is always here. Looks

3a0ad29a-3989-41f6-9c71-ffd259a99dc3-1
00:47:35.898 --> 00:47:38.900
like the milkman may be off duty
though.

f4a58510-9313-442a-aa41-a6fbd65bc67a-0
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.141
And maybe he married that young
girl with the red hair and now

f4a58510-9313-442a-aa41-a6fbd65bc67a-1
00:47:43.141 --> 00:47:46.218
they're grown up. Oh gosh, no,
no. It's too hard to judge a

f4a58510-9313-442a-aa41-a6fbd65bc67a-2
00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:49.346
time. I don't think much time
has gone on because of the guy

f4a58510-9313-442a-aa41-a6fbd65bc67a-3
00:47:49.346 --> 00:47:50.270
in the cast there.

2960e7d4-e603-4f78-b7f5-89623b3f14bc-0
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.010
The boys are still.

211f9d74-8dd7-4efb-9fd1-b6e2401cd092-0
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.660
Doing some mischief.

812e399d-fdf9-443a-be21-d61e5d31f326-0
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:00.860
There's.

d8c7b777-01a6-479f-9ceb-50d21d290fbe-0
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.880
Umm.

6090d072-71e4-4d10-bde0-cf66bda18cd5-0
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.480
Oh yeah, the two women are still
in their step, chatting.

7178ef51-4fa0-48e8-b7b7-1c4a0f2a324e-0
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.490
In exactly the same way.

cbce1a2b-5bde-4896-88e0-5caab778dfaf-0
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.590
Alrighty, next one, I guess.

40d5d041-f890-4096-8a72-e21e1dbcff5d-0
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.333
Alright then, we're back to a
view of the square where the

40d5d041-f890-4096-8a72-e21e1dbcff5d-1
00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:27.130
fellow with the hat first
entered and he's retreating.

76ae770e-bf32-41a7-9911-00d9cdaeb8a7-0
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.610
And it appears to be dusk.
There's some nice color in the

76ae770e-bf32-41a7-9911-00d9cdaeb8a7-1
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:32.810
sky.

dcd5350b-eff9-4f26-a719-147d288ca503-0
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.240
We see the cafe.

43972788-3a43-4f1c-9932-008eef5bc2bd-0
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.470
The young girl in one window
upstairs.

acec83cc-d39e-4ccc-b3bb-d979b332cc24-0
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:42.780
There's a couple, romantically.

cbea422d-7a92-4a8e-b821-82fd226822a2-0
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.790
snuggling in one of the windows
above.

b9f30ea3-f63a-4202-8b1f-1ecb482b3b13-0
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:50.410
There's a father and a son and a
daughter.

84f344d6-888c-4aa2-8ff7-0574758aa0fc-0
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.110
Looking out on the little
village.

3f2c9efd-3ae0-4df4-a8ea-90e7632415d7-0
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:55.910
It's quite quiet.

f1211e49-92e0-48e8-af86-1f978925e3b4-0
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:59.330
But some people still moving
through.

46d68f8a-a0a1-4aad-995c-7d8e28350a11-0
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.130
It's a sweet little town.

52800e41-0963-465d-af23-5ac6dab81dc9-0
00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:04.290
Just about to go to bed for the
night, I think.

9a4b63de-2ca8-4406-82e6-01fb69accf43-0
00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.290
Aha.

44045542-90c5-4527-bb8e-7aae6ad58edb-0
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.160
So.

d622a7ef-94e9-4530-a70a-cc141d1c7a06-0
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.940


f33014bf-80af-4d35-b475-590904b084b0-0
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.770
Here's a gentleman.

1a9d2e0a-9e0e-4fe7-865d-3268ae3e228e-0
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.070
Who we first saw.

81981702-1d07-4814-bde8-f6513755b41f-0
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.990
And his little dog.

311a2501-2231-4b84-85c8-d16b0303444c-0
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.209
I think he's gotten older. I
think this is the man that

311a2501-2231-4b84-85c8-d16b0303444c-1
00:49:28.209 --> 00:49:29.610
bought and fixed up the.

e9bc1330-f1b2-46fc-85bd-88869b93ea64-0
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.060
The home for himself.

30bf74d4-464e-4659-ae31-c13aabea3677-0
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.810
And we see the for sale sign
again.

5fa94cf8-2809-4d32-bfa8-af6ec6ab76d4-0
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.330
Everything's.

4fe4dcfb-d627-4424-b3d5-4db9c94f353a-0
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.000
In black and white now and
people are startled.

747db1f4-c4b0-402e-990f-7b9e1a2af698-0
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:43.320
Looking out their windows.

90a86abb-6a78-4129-a44b-ba726e87c034-0
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.690
Seeing this.

f023c10d-badc-48ac-bf09-158c43e2b1fa-0
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:52.120
He has a bag with flowers
printed on it.

5f9e6cc2-159c-4237-bacf-07013ab5d2ab-0
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.700
His umbrella.

f03cb5ac-5043-4b46-b84a-5fefff8ea68a-0
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.131
Maybe he's a ghost, I don't
know. But he's multicoloured,

f03cb5ac-5043-4b46-b84a-5fefff8ea68a-1
00:49:59.131 --> 00:50:02.110
he's technicolored. Don't really
know what's happening, but.

23028546-1d62-4d0a-b674-a8a3e54e9835-0
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.660
Sweet kind of evening.

b8a99702-5eb3-4b52-8adb-c97d9751b5da-0
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.780
With the cloud over him. So
yeah, he's under a misty cloud.

29c76d66-7d3e-4216-bad0-75c59572f411-0
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.100
And the for sale sign's back up.

a5c92427-068d-4b52-a63c-fbda0c7f4889-0
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.330
So ah, interesting.

a5334935-5e8b-4fe9-82ba-e8762d5e6182-0
00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:19.550
Huh.

9d3f1f18-0607-47ad-a537-ea63df7ee2a3-0
00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.590
So the older fellow.

2e9d488d-6587-44d7-850e-fbe0af0dd12e-0
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:31.324
Somehow, left is leaving his
flowers behind and he's on his

2e9d488d-6587-44d7-850e-fbe0af0dd12e-1
00:50:31.324 --> 00:50:31.680
way.

3ed60634-e338-4e86-8e9c-3bec47d25da4-0
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.310
And people are very happy to be
finding these flowers.

b0c56d1f-bbc3-4b9d-9646-e4e99aeb0b96-0
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.550
I think he's saying a goodbye.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:46.740
Hmm.

4eecfe7b-339c-4c9f-a362-d72c7115f319-0
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:58.120
Let me see what next. OK, next
we have another short story.

9f19ead2-3bda-46d8-955a-3cceeff55304-0
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.490
This one six slides.

27f4b7e6-f940-47ea-8230-4b72e6d2c8a8-0
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.620
Next.

15a9173c-bc68-47d1-89a3-21a57dff77ea-0
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:26.200
Slides.

03d15829-87cd-4b9a-b004-eda58ac67d43-0
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.160
#START_arrival_6 So there's an
earthenware.

36e62ed4-6259-42b9-8eec-20bd7afe4ce6-0
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.020
Jug.

700aa181-050c-4d06-a3e3-1359173683ad-0
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.470
On a window sill.

d560cd1a-4336-44c5-95ac-f9a19c72faf7-0
00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.770
And out of it flies.

b29a6983-9854-4581-8e97-f5735ae9e26a-0
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.060
Something. We've seen this kind
of a critter before, last week.

ce5bd381-c305-4961-a110-f9fa8c4900f0-0
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.940
Crazy little pointy arms.

549c30e8-5135-4ce4-ba11-5646dd1d9e54-0
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.680
Ohh.

0f9e6072-b490-4631-b30a-42d4b6c69457-0
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.200
Yeah. And then.

3419ade3-37d8-44ec-a0bf-1dbd070de9b6-0
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.780
The legs of this.

f087d936-db9e-4139-b8f0-e46a2139f487-0
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.541
Traveler, the husband or father
father that we knew from some

f087d936-db9e-4139-b8f0-e46a2139f487-1
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:57.490
from last week.

6be734a1-efea-4be8-85bc-4dbde0c36c61-0
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.170
And he's carrying this creature,
which is like a mouse.

d54fc912-d926-4c98-9465-e5d8e4e55c08-0
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:07.608
Oh no, he's not carrying it, but
the creatures walking alongside

d54fc912-d926-4c98-9465-e5d8e4e55c08-1
00:52:07.608 --> 00:52:07.810
him.

8971d72d-6296-4c27-855b-c51fe2b8b871-0
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.950
As he asked directions of a
villager.

d66380c3-6d16-487b-beb4-a02dde185a84-0
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.740
Who has shown him?

69c57073-2d31-4dae-890d-dc04c6885aae-0
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.850
To this kind of a robot looking
thing.

70429bb4-d03f-4d76-be41-1a0bfdc68749-0
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.580
OK and then.

af625a4b-8bc0-4d85-afa3-87d04b429783-0
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:30.030
It's night time. He's at his
desk.

02fa8a8b-2a0a-49cc-85e3-8739643f5160-0
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:32.830
And writing.

d1e2ce4d-c0e6-4a55-8a25-f0f05dffb19a-0
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:36.140
umm

6dc36b17-4c00-492f-807d-aca714359105-0
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.660
A letter, probably a letter
home.

4b5d0be0-af8e-4322-ab92-8707a06f9503-0
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.780
And he goes out to a mailbox and
inserts it.

ad9badd6-2862-46bb-ac57-b103f561ab26-0
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:48.090
Unusual mailbox.

8eb4ca7d-5205-4fa0-aa90-e1b7d1fc3a8b-0
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.580
And then

2570c0a4-6f88-4025-a9db-2bbb8c7fffa5-0
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.500
When you see him.

98d921f6-36c7-44d7-9667-b1b9e6aaa6a5-0
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:59.829
{Oh, wait a minute. Should I
have gone? Is it one page on the

98d921f6-36c7-44d7-9667-b1b9e6aaa6a5-1
00:52:59.829 --> 00:53:04.092
left, Megan, and then one page
on the right? I yeah, yeah,

98d921f6-36c7-44d7-9667-b1b9e6aaa6a5-2
00:53:04.092 --> 00:53:08.571
yeah. OK. I was going all the
way across, all right. So he so

98d921f6-36c7-44d7-9667-b1b9e6aaa6a5-3
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:09.150
alright.

e253fc2f-134f-48fb-847f-3cab4520e9b4-0
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:15.352
Something where} earthenware
little bird flies out. Oh, he

e253fc2f-134f-48fb-847f-3cab4520e9b4-1
00:53:15.352 --> 00:53:16.400
writes a letter.

d57b4128-5cbd-4f58-81db-7aee9eca9e25-0
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:23.302
Folds it into a bird, puts it in
an envelope. OK with money.

d57b4128-5cbd-4f58-81db-7aee9eca9e25-1
00:53:23.302 --> 00:53:24.820
Seals the envelope.

c3ae1f7b-d8bc-4a79-ad46-489e98c58817-0
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.618
Goes out with this little
creature accompanying him, asks

c3ae1f7b-d8bc-4a79-ad46-489e98c58817-1
00:53:29.618 --> 00:53:31.840
directions to get to the
mailbox.

80784c65-d195-47ea-8999-371e8ee95127-0
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.892
All right, then puts the letter
with the money and the bird into

80784c65-d195-47ea-8999-371e8ee95127-1
00:53:36.892 --> 00:53:37.700
the mailbox.

c27d7c2f-0ae2-460b-905f-43881695d666-0
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.640
And looks up.

7be34eca-d690-4c9a-b030-de67ec7d286f-0
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.724
Oh, because, Oh my gosh, this
thing levitates. It goes to the

7be34eca-d690-4c9a-b030-de67ec7d286f-1
00:53:44.724 --> 00:53:48.519
destination with your letter.
Absolutely unbelievable. And he

7be34eca-d690-4c9a-b030-de67ec7d286f-2
00:53:48.519 --> 00:53:51.580
heads off across the countryside
with his little.

a8177ed2-6bf9-4ce9-8f9f-32d9c29434b7-0
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:57.349
Companion, which is some kind of
a funny mouse that he maybe it's

a8177ed2-6bf9-4ce9-8f9f-32d9c29434b7-1
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:59.700
has crawled out of that jar,
evidently.

22ccc7b5-dab7-463c-9554-ddbab81926cb-0
00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:05.382
Wow. I hope the letter gets
where it's supposed to be going.

22ccc7b5-dab7-463c-9554-ddbab81926cb-1
00:54:05.382 --> 00:54:06.250
{Excuse me.}

0dae4316-c9dc-45cf-bec7-83bce99056b5-0
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.670
And OK so.

25069691-325a-4e8c-b6be-e2935deaf744-0
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:15.073
He's walking through this
countryside and the what appear

25069691-325a-4e8c-b6be-e2935deaf744-1
00:54:15.073 --> 00:54:17.820
to be trees transform or leaves
transform.

550db632-4a21-4ed9-bb35-ef3b685cdfe3-0
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.020
Into flowers.

ddcd8044-3175-41fd-b2d9-c5fd89881598-0
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:27.610
Fascinating.

71e0ef82-86b8-4e8d-9b0f-5ccdfb1dee8e-0
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:29.810
Yeah.

97ebed04-b782-4533-a185-714872bbaa94-0
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:32.940
All the seasons of the year.

ea9ce7db-852d-46bf-9531-80414c3e1553-0
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.930


7221701b-0ff7-4796-9e30-a30cbbbc7f41-0
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.090
I see an amazing Kingdom.

f64bc619-751e-4cca-909f-f2edc9c2658c-0
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.360
Just created or shows up.

5360a79d-30d1-4052-82ea-a0c3c3509a63-0
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:47.297
I've never seen anything quite
like it. There's a giant

5360a79d-30d1-4052-82ea-a0c3c3509a63-1
00:54:47.297 --> 00:54:50.824
building with Windows randomly
placed all the way down its

5360a79d-30d1-4052-82ea-a0c3c3509a63-2
00:54:50.824 --> 00:54:51.899
side, and there's.

d388e7df-bbc6-4148-b320-5123998fbcd7-0
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.610
Roadways on top of buildings.

89b1957a-d5e2-4c4e-81b1-aea2f26ef371-0
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.944
It almost looks as though snow
has fallen, but it might just

89b1957a-d5e2-4c4e-81b1-aea2f26ef371-1
00:54:59.944 --> 00:55:00.120
be.

8863d489-5c3a-4a36-8b36-c6de3120982c-0
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:01.920
Sand.

07663785-b852-441a-bba3-86280f37c294-0
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.140
Surfaces and.

a54ca297-30b0-4de2-9eea-6f4287b0908e-0
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:12.901
Smokestacks, ornate smokestacks,
and something that looks like a

a54ca297-30b0-4de2-9eea-6f4287b0908e-1
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:13.480
teepee.

aeb58364-b9be-48f5-a0fb-ad6b4bdd8208-0
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.810
Well.

e83da798-af6d-4c1f-9eae-b53afd234c68-0
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.891
Vegetation over the rolling
hills and you see roads heading

e83da798-af6d-4c1f-9eae-b53afd234c68-1
00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:21.150
out.

ad4c20d8-1825-4214-b9a1-06baaa44762c-0
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.023
A lot going on in the distance.
Things flying in the air in the

ad4c20d8-1825-4214-b9a1-06baaa44762c-1
00:55:26.023 --> 00:55:26.460
distance.

4588b771-4c3f-4d57-b9af-938fc90e7fe9-0
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.098
Something looks like a Ferris
wheel. Several somethings look

4588b771-4c3f-4d57-b9af-938fc90e7fe9-1
00:55:31.098 --> 00:55:34.996
like Ferris wheels but they're
patterned discs. Don't really

4588b771-4c3f-4d57-b9af-938fc90e7fe9-2
00:55:34.996 --> 00:55:38.000
know why and a lot of chimney
type things but.

b5a95542-3ff0-47c8-b8bf-f27c8ee90134-0
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.540
Much more primitive than Aztec
looking than.

fea2ed79-4166-493c-9c48-14aca567a114-0
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.180
Anything we know.

19bfd5d6-8112-429e-be0e-32b0bf83b4ef-0
00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.680
That's kind of futuristic and
ancient at the same time.

c7615f7f-158b-49a8-a1f6-33a294399144-0
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.390
This little village, yeah. Don't
know what's going on here.

9808dc31-4e87-4ae9-9974-ab7396146825-0
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.870
{Ready for the next one?}

1d8027d4-4532-4b56-86f0-c04229087c14-0
00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:00.890
So all right, there's something
growing in the earthenware pot.

985b6d2c-994d-4e68-bc4d-9cd300acb05b-0
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.940
And his little.

fcb2fa31-b0ce-41a3-b9f1-c352627c7a4e-0
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.790
Comrade is tending to it. Oh
gosh, maybe there are a little.

ec406f65-0b23-4140-851a-e1468126ff95-0
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.610
Little animals growing in there.

755e163f-f9ca-4a95-a28f-32b640329e98-0
00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:16.586
Meanwhile, the dad is sitting on
his bed looking at the family

755e163f-f9ca-4a95-a28f-32b640329e98-1
00:56:16.586 --> 00:56:19.550
photo. He misses them a lot, he
can tell.

e89ad0f2-e5ec-4b4f-86b1-22dfc48d309c-0
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.140
And it's almost as if his
little.

fe1387a0-ccaf-450d-995a-d0c5a28f4133-0
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.590
Creature.

d34243dc-ec44-4420-9ae8-e82723aae405-0
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.100
Is sad.

d0f59f77-e0cf-4175-86ad-138681e325c0-0
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:31.060
Feeling like it's not getting
noticed when the dad is lost in.

f6ea1d29-5862-46cb-94aa-4217991a5ebc-0
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.240
Thought missing his family.

a5a124bb-1375-4d3e-b530-c2132c22af40-0
00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:36.780
And.

0046476c-75ff-460f-baba-7ba3a931166f-0
00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:43.465
The little creature runs, trying
to escape, maybe? goes down this

0046476c-75ff-460f-baba-7ba3a931166f-1
00:56:43.465 --> 00:56:46.650
ladder. The man follows down the
ladder.

799b9ef3-a0e7-4e11-a717-c09c3b35191a-0
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.150
And finds a letter has arrived.

be17c581-ddc8-4155-bc77-f1a55ac2cd14-0
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:50.950
Ah.

2a195991-5ddc-40c3-b314-b9c977fe59e0-0
00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.200
They open it and it's a bird in
an envelope.

019fb98c-29c3-40ce-a991-15d75fdce99c-0
00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:01.080
And Oh my gosh, the dad's
smiling, getting the bird he's

019fb98c-29c3-40ce-a991-15d75fdce99c-1
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.220
smiling, reading.

49e575a0-1888-40ca-b613-f9d07505623d-0
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:03.830
The note.

75e2dcfa-49b9-4e06-b389-8680bdb2485f-0
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.240
It's really amazing that.

03dfae29-4def-4e9f-b478-f8d89734db76-0
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:11.071
His words got to his family and
that he's hearing back. It's so

03dfae29-4def-4e9f-b478-f8d89734db76-1
00:57:11.071 --> 00:57:12.520
nice to see him smiling.

0325fb0a-38fd-43c0-91fd-4c1cdee9631e-0
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:15.170
He's looking out the window.

07ce986e-d6a9-49bd-9f7a-d1704d68b3c6-0
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:23.360
OK, there's the paper model of
his little his little friend.

aa145e60-549b-45af-a6f4-09d5bec302ad-0
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:28.290
And some kind of a crazy
machine, the dad's hat and a

aa145e60-549b-45af-a6f4-09d5bec302ad-1
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:28.750
towel.

0ad02c68-e9a8-4ddb-bee7-677108ae2800-0
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.330
Map hanging from a.

badce111-810b-433d-8093-05429d6f3f02-0
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:33.770
Hanging from pigs.

a6a41fba-f560-47f6-b3c7-e2580ef16e9c-0
00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.780
There is what looks like a bowl
of food.

fcd1b433-3e83-4ae3-b7d2-39c2bafc4e35-0
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:39.530
Don't know about that.

30fa2493-d5aa-44f2-9806-18e07d1591a5-0
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:43.670
Doesn't look terribly edible and
the fork's scary.

1fafd35d-321b-4511-9b4d-7f76293b4f0f-0
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.640
Ohh, maybe the dad's been
drawing there's this flying

1fafd35d-321b-4511-9b4d-7f76293b4f0f-1
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.000
ship.

fee33089-c9ad-4350-baea-7fcf436c7195-0
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.630
Got a couple of contraptions.

9d316f78-2859-4b50-8f1a-8c922c94495a-0
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:58.050
And there's a cup of tea or
coffee newspaper.

776c8a67-e2aa-432f-8f96-7de3d8a2196a-0
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:06.011
And the beautiful family photo
that he takes such good care of.

776c8a67-e2aa-432f-8f96-7de3d8a2196a-1
00:58:06.011 --> 00:58:07.260
Then we see.

e43de7e3-f4d4-4c4e-86c4-26d83ab96335-0
00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.795
His hand giving a small hand
some money coin from the looks

e43de7e3-f4d4-4c4e-86c4-26d83ab96335-1
00:58:12.795 --> 00:58:14.510
of it, don't know why.

e33c3220-0840-4a65-b5be-b9f162315b00-0
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:17.000
Yep.

6994681c-9e07-4656-b70e-0c9c8246e325-0
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.330
Oh my gosh, is it possible

e6544959-fddf-4e2e-b6fb-71adb10efde8-0
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.907
That he's back with his family?
Yes. And the crazy little

e6544959-fddf-4e2e-b6fb-71adb10efde8-1
00:58:25.907 --> 00:58:27.410
creature came with him.

4e630b07-a42d-4131-b0d4-27eddc474223-0
00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:33.006
Oh my gosh. And the paper model
of his creatures on the mantle.

4e630b07-a42d-4131-b0d4-27eddc474223-1
00:58:33.006 --> 00:58:34.870
He's actually made it home.

5e2ea3b8-f72f-4855-ac47-2c389eff8209-0
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:40.580
So they've just had a meal
together, it looks like.

ba8cfbfc-89b2-4019-9623-c9c6fed51b21-0
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:45.020
He's teaching her something with
three fingers of his hand.

a7b40708-ca79-47bd-b7e8-0de02c1f5268-0
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.240
Being some kind of a message or
a sign.

64ffc11e-bd46-49ed-b734-a3d687a46451-0
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:53.890
And the young girl puts on her
boots in her coat and her hat.

e49e37f3-8749-486c-925d-823be7b8409e-0
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:57.500
And heads out with that adorable
little creature.

a0e5a0ad-8eda-4188-8749-aa6749bc5caa-0
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.400
And she's showing him.

52369615-d4e1-4a24-a5ae-638c1eabfe7b-0
00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.560
How

12297694-0e60-46e1-b329-daf41b027342-0
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:04.920
There are these little.

212f8af9-8cbc-4362-aa83-7859ae3dbcca-0
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:06.900
Stars.

140b3569-e796-4c67-870a-4dd7ccf01c6c-0
00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.710
That live amongst them.

3973dc18-5c4c-4566-a9d2-b24b7cf3e924-0
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.400
Introducing a little creature to
the landscape. #END_arrival_6

c68f65df-cc9b-4865-bbdc-8f576f2e18b7-0
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.560
OK, let me see.

cadbd890-969a-4610-81ba-ffe8cea38563-0
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.420
OK, we have another short story.

810f70d8-8b80-4626-a1c2-be9e29f1cbc7-0
00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:41.198
OK. If you wanna take a break
now, you could and then we'll

810f70d8-8b80-4626-a1c2-be9e29f1cbc7-1
00:59:41.198 --> 00:59:44.580
continue. OK. I should stretch
Megan so.

7c617b82-588e-4588-9fc8-526cb9a36293-0
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.740
Just take a couple of minutes,
yes. OK. Thanks.

3fcd788c-0e58-45a0-81c7-cd84e95e2ee8-0
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.130
So.

c7512fbe-26a4-48eb-a6d6-480a0031412d-0
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:10.767
#START_arrival_4 All right,
we've got a new page here and

c7512fbe-26a4-48eb-a6d6-480a0031412d-1
01:00:10.767 --> 01:00:14.405
I'm I'm seeing with the father's
home, he's taking a shower and

c7512fbe-26a4-48eb-a6d6-480a0031412d-2
01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:14.859
shaving,

82434179-98b9-4c58-9e19-28a8c37833bd-0
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:18.520
Putting on new clothes, getting
the shoes on.

fcf5d8ca-8254-4473-bf0e-49c99b4e54bf-0
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:22.070
It looks like that center is.

d23a82f3-6870-4473-bffc-ffe4b66a3cd1-0
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:26.221
Maybe putting some money
together? I can't see quite what

d23a82f3-6870-4473-bffc-ffe4b66a3cd1-1
01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:28.140
he has in his hand, clearly,
but.

ccb4fedc-699f-4ec4-aec9-a5786d66e5b5-0
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:34.710
He picks up his hat and it's a
map.

1f6ca42c-85fb-41ee-a194-f44bc815606c-0
01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:38.960
And he's opening the map, he and
his little creature.

823d26e3-6da5-495b-b6f7-301b7e7ce194-0
01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.090
Or heading out with the
destination.

a23e1a87-d6d9-4d2a-be44-3d3b4978bb87-0
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.300
They're following a winding Road

5b008e23-707c-4187-b5fb-45aae8aa7188-0
01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:52.090
Just as it is on the map. He's
studying things carefully.

12f6155d-c7d8-41c0-80e5-e865ecb187da-0
01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:54.090
And.

6cf375e9-a2c2-407f-bdda-eb06db59c73d-0
01:00:56.410 --> 01:01:00.610
Again, they are in the city
that.

527d9b30-23e9-43f6-8521-c3a56d26310c-0
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.050
Is really remarkable.

e753e40c-8b29-4286-a134-5e91cfddb3d2-0
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.370
There are things floating.

ef1c4011-2a93-413b-a1da-431d22b85bdc-0
01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:10.482
Through the air, boats floating
through the air. There's what

ef1c4011-2a93-413b-a1da-431d22b85bdc-1
01:01:10.482 --> 01:01:11.020
looks like.

b4bf8f93-24ef-4ff5-b248-104a6942dc78-0
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.470
You know, early American teepees
and.

8fb1ed4e-f6a9-4952-a7d0-949af0e0d939-0
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:22.663
An aqueduct above it. So and all
these things have patterns on

8fb1ed4e-f6a9-4952-a7d0-949af0e0d939-1
01:01:22.663 --> 01:01:23.080
them.

e475e647-cd08-43a4-a38d-b82e3fee10c4-0
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.986
Buildings and the boats and all.
It's fascinating civilization.

e475e647-cd08-43a4-a38d-b82e3fee10c4-1
01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:29.520
Don't know where he is.

3bd9e928-cb8f-4e7a-8c11-87fd0f695f75-0
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.762
{Ready for next, yep.} So Oh my
gosh, his creature, his little

3bd9e928-cb8f-4e7a-8c11-87fd0f695f75-1
01:01:35.762 --> 01:01:37.030
critter friend finds.

25f4b3d1-6974-4462-912d-75cc2bdcbdbf-0
01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:41.808
Another little animal with
adorable ears that stands

25f4b3d1-6974-4462-912d-75cc2bdcbdbf-1
01:01:41.808 --> 01:01:44.280
straight up a lot like the
teepees.

26397436-b2ad-4a28-9b0e-8dd07e16fdd7-0
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:48.750
That appears to be the pet of a
woman who's also.

00e35e7f-4aa2-4951-b23b-466a069ec2ea-0
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.581
Reading that, who, woman a woman
who's standing there reading a

00e35e7f-4aa2-4951-b23b-466a069ec2ea-1
01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:52.810
book.

4b492bfd-d2f5-46c4-9bfd-2ecc04ee8c49-0
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.370
And the dad

3882b4b9-3cc8-40a9-bea5-f66dfc1a4092-0
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.200
Asks her a question, maybe for
directions, yeah.

eddbc1c9-37f3-4970-a579-833b07cb3ffd-0
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.810
Ask her to help him.

feb55013-b43b-4371-91dc-5107f84e8af6-0
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.720
Navigate.

ed79a753-a41d-4dba-8a75-0d5674176ee6-0
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.460
And.

2c0ee69a-3bc1-4ded-85ff-4a279496c465-0
01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.997
She shows him how to do
something with this machine,

2c0ee69a-3bc1-4ded-85ff-4a279496c465-1
01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:12.950
which is maybe to get a ticket.

9826a684-a31a-481d-8f09-3d41c8e62691-0
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.570
Looks like he might need
transportation.

cb1617cd-7688-462a-9acf-7c55f9402674-0
01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.325
And here comes one of those
vehicles. It's floating

cb1617cd-7688-462a-9acf-7c55f9402674-1
01:02:23.325 --> 01:02:27.340
vehicles. It's kind of a
steamship, an air steamship.

92b31bcb-d2ae-4e6e-a053-d342e046a8b2-0
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.810
People are waiting down below.

247930a7-12b2-45fa-a11d-58d6850cc713-0
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:32.300
His creatures with him.

ad033087-7efd-49f5-b1c9-4cdb24cbdc4e-0
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.600
His ticket gets checked.

d53f6ef6-63b0-49cf-9aec-575c73daf093-0
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.160
And he's motioned to get on
board.

0abe8777-2a3b-46a6-8322-aea825a04e46-0
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.910
{Ready for the next one?}

36a0a9f7-1f6f-4f9f-a143-d91e34487276-0
01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:49.457
OK, and he's sitting on a seat
woman who helped him figure out

36a0a9f7-1f6f-4f9f-a143-d91e34487276-1
01:02:49.457 --> 01:02:51.140
where he needs to go.

a9b92c34-f404-4f34-82a8-cb38812cb967-0
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.100
Is also traveling the same
direction and her little pet is

a9b92c34-f404-4f34-82a8-cb38812cb967-1
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:56.720
with her.

e9222283-f570-44ce-9260-b9a31ddbd0af-0
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.080
There are other travelers.

2a18a6b6-09d0-4a1b-a1ae-9e7313d53fcc-0
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.140
And he's.

c8f4ff9e-933f-46e6-8b8c-5618434f7396-0
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.440
Telling her.

34e3f480-3fad-4903-93b9-3f802e096123-0
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.291
Why he's what He's up to telling
her his story, and it looks as

34e3f480-3fad-4903-93b9-3f802e096123-1
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:13.870
though.

7d9e5280-96b7-4263-b87a-79ab45fefdb6-0
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.520
He's trying to find someone.

d8f92adb-3f4f-4723-8de4-02fae78ff645-0
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.010
And maybe she's trying to find
the same person.

cbc945c5-0d72-4fa3-825f-4f8bb7390cae-0
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:31.312
It's amazing on the next page
we're seeing that person that

cbc945c5-0d72-4fa3-825f-4f8bb7390cae-1
01:03:31.312 --> 01:03:32.670
they're trying to find.

910536f5-00ab-4b89-855b-f6d53f0b64e6-0
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:34.740
And.

2dd3c232-3e3f-4c53-9ef7-c35831cf6118-0
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.360
She's reading a book and being.

01a56558-b5e0-47bb-b4b5-6c2b62e522fc-0
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:45.781
uh, someone's taking the book
away from her. It's put in a

01a56558-b5e0-47bb-b4b5-6c2b62e522fc-1
01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:49.018
drawer. The drawer's locked.
She's given a shovel. She's

01a56558-b5e0-47bb-b4b5-6c2b62e522fc-2
01:03:49.018 --> 01:03:52.483
being put to work. Oh, my gosh.
So they're trying to rescue.

01a56558-b5e0-47bb-b4b5-6c2b62e522fc-3
01:03:52.483 --> 01:03:56.005
Maybe they're each trying to
rescue this little girl who's in

01a56558-b5e0-47bb-b4b5-6c2b62e522fc-4
01:03:56.005 --> 01:03:56.630
a terrible.

cb2ff599-890a-4695-a2e8-4aae1724d54d-0
01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.610
Kind of.

ee87a196-ec83-47e6-87b0-76a28f6a486e-0
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.690
Jail situation.

c0ad74ab-d888-46ab-b0a9-541a8d0a40eb-0
01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.510
Being held captive.

2ed44feb-ab8d-40ed-92b2-29e3c2526b79-0
01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.410
{Yeah, next one.}

9576dc76-6605-48f3-885f-19cbb0eb454a-0
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.980
OK, oh, there she is.

04819748-7ac5-43fd-8f73-e4d05b3a3284-0
01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.390
She's not alone. Other people.

a2251369-32c2-4115-9f25-d95bdef2c87b-0
01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:22.610
are being held.

f47048e3-f544-44bb-986e-8c97a87d0373-0
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.110
Horrible situation.

2ae8ba02-500a-40cb-b834-0452d4e0a118-0
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:29.000
But somehow she's getting back
into that drawer.

6982b53f-cea0-4450-8299-11b230c0ce5f-0
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:33.100
Looks like.

6e648179-d676-4d24-8ad6-a1cc7b26c764-0
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.230
Maybe escaping?

e294eddc-8d83-4801-975f-0c183205bf2d-0
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.398
There's a train in the last
drawing there. I can't believe

e294eddc-8d83-4801-975f-0c183205bf2d-1
01:04:42.398 --> 01:04:45.747
she's found her way out of this
situation, but it would be

e294eddc-8d83-4801-975f-0c183205bf2d-2
01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:46.940
wonderful if she has.

ae34d16b-5e7d-46b2-b433-db87571e5aca-0
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.960
OK.

40ddc4e5-1029-40ac-9a14-340548cbb284-0
01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:52.750
And here comes.

026b5739-b79d-43bc-b7b7-4e7a03d2c595-0
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.210
the dad.

60aaacf9-99f7-49a2-8c20-bdf00702f389-0
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.680
on this flying paddle wheel
steamer.

9705bf4d-efea-4903-9677-5c87b2bb9669-0
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.987
And the woman who's helping him
find his way there is pointing

9705bf4d-efea-4903-9677-5c87b2bb9669-1
01:05:04.987 --> 01:05:06.970
out where he'll need to go.

4e03fa87-95cf-4e48-b70e-fff44eeb56a4-0
01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.310
The.

99597fa2-da07-40f3-a3e3-f39b149bce15-0
01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.060
Boat conductor calls out the
stop.

fd2310ef-5740-4ff6-8370-b795b06cdd22-0
01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.592
He thanks the woman who's helped
him so much, and he and his pet

fd2310ef-5740-4ff6-8370-b795b06cdd22-1
01:05:18.592 --> 01:05:22.290
get off, get a look at where
they're headed, it's.

a54fb704-4385-401f-b853-0cba8be69be8-0
01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.710
Really quite unusual.

cc6be420-e5aa-465f-bf91-cc334074d954-0
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:31.021
A huge animal building or
sculpture up ahead and there are

cc6be420-e5aa-465f-bf91-cc334074d954-1
01:05:31.021 --> 01:05:33.220
people in exotic dress here.

e4fc0d72-bc81-498f-8f57-d233a170757c-0
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.630
Somewhat Asian and ancient at
the same time.

e44d88f9-c09d-42ee-9461-f4f612b9f672-0
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.320
This guy is such an adventurer.

ca6617ea-d868-4c95-92fb-265f9960bf30-0
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.141
And luckily, he still got his
companion pet companion with

ca6617ea-d868-4c95-92fb-265f9960bf30-1
01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:45.420
him.

7748eab7-51a0-4402-beb6-2fef66f6f2c1-0
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.340
looks they're walking through
the streets.

0f71ae96-55d6-4c75-ac1c-ee722659da0c-0
01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.350
There's so many tentacles.

3329d40a-9868-480d-97c7-11a8cd93546e-0
01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:04.380
Whether it's things growing or
what, I don't really know.

6ffcb7c9-a738-4b0c-afab-a8612b416331-0
01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:08.820
You see them a lot, just like
the tail of this animal and.

6deb443d-5b4c-44df-b7a5-06faa1df31cf-0
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:13.150
If we're seeing things right,
there's a young woman.

7afd7155-8d67-457c-a388-58975f03da69-0
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:17.173
and is buying something or
getting a ticket? There's

7afd7155-8d67-457c-a388-58975f03da69-1
01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.470
someone buying a fish.

82f52e0d-75bb-4f31-89a0-b319f6229317-0
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.210
You see him walking down the
Boulevard, a very wide sidewalk,

82f52e0d-75bb-4f31-89a0-b319f6229317-1
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.560
and he still has his pet with
him and he's.

66d9b7b3-58da-4bd5-ad91-63faaae70f3a-0
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:29.470
he's reading.

0ce3745d-1ed0-4b85-a154-fa2e221eaa20-0
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.120
In a book, maybe it's a
language. Maybe.

7e9a1999-a9b5-4a67-a343-2b1ee2f57e79-0
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:39.110
Maybe it's a language, but there
are pictures and.

1774081c-efa1-44c8-adfe-e5774d37f8fa-0
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.130
Names next to the pictures here
from the looks of it.

4582229c-5006-408a-9135-3fd6ecd222a0-0
01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:48.320
Drawers.

0153e581-07de-4bc2-9275-901de5f13c31-0
01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.490
{Lord have mercy.}

d64c0d3f-50d3-4027-84a9-23d33d0161e6-0
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.280
So.

a99ec0ac-f30a-4243-be29-92316d63083f-0
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.418
What is he looking for? He's
looking for a little creature,

a99ec0ac-f30a-4243-be29-92316d63083f-1
01:06:57.418 --> 01:06:57.750
maybe.

774cf4db-28a5-401b-9483-44b6e8ca311b-0
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:00.980
Puppy.

105f64fc-aece-46ee-beb8-4ee5cd587fab-0
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.388
And a boy comes up to him and
ask if this is what he wants.

105f64fc-aece-46ee-beb8-4ee5cd587fab-1
01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:07.350
And the father.

a37df688-db4d-49cf-b44c-3dc1489995f8-0
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:12.190
His father in here are waving at
him.

9a94d331-2308-43fc-bcf1-261a897a53be-0
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.600
Yeah, and he says no, this is
what I want.

9fc15e47-341a-4567-8b25-933088583ff9-0
01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.120
They help him open another door.

9cfde71a-d61f-4206-9d45-66d5743b7b4b-0
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.660
Pull out something.

938c1935-d741-44ec-ae3c-c7647a6650ec-0
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.270
And.

5632a4dd-17c3-4f17-b54d-6453a2e4b1a5-0
01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.390
He holds it. The dad holds it.

d2c87cb3-25fd-4444-aa17-2aad8578ad48-0
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.642
He's being offered a bowl of a
basket or a basket perhaps for

d2c87cb3-25fd-4444-aa17-2aad8578ad48-1
01:07:37.642 --> 01:07:39.380
carrying this creature.

d05c4c92-9863-429e-8190-4cfb6982de00-0
01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:44.592
Boy offers him a basket. He
takes the basket and the father

d05c4c92-9863-429e-8190-4cfb6982de00-1
01:07:44.592 --> 01:07:48.796
and son who've helped him are
showing him where he go next, it

d05c4c92-9863-429e-8190-4cfb6982de00-2
01:07:48.796 --> 01:07:49.530
looks like.

bc9dc0a9-33f1-4e40-9ae7-a7d1979285a7-0
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.690
OK.

a257fb16-5ff7-4902-af5e-d151661ada03-0
01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:04.190
All these creatures, it's food.
So they're

420b3d84-5e3b-472d-a4c3-55134fd7eb3b-0
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.970
Introducing him to new food.

0de10fa4-5b83-4f10-b3f8-a657419f7f49-0
01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.650
Showing him how to eat it.

23e5e129-ed0a-47e0-b94b-195a5ba0f924-0
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.230
He tries it.

42836799-0126-4eef-be54-1f8ced135bd8-0
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:19.950
Doesn't look like it's agreeing
with him. The boy is trying to

42836799-0126-4eef-be54-1f8ced135bd8-1
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:23.630
feed the pet something. They
have a whole basket of edibles.

c344fd62-ea39-4e7c-84aa-a384b6ee2ea9-0
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.530
The boy's whispering to the dad.
The dad.

cf3d5034-6e28-4b18-98ce-7d39888e6397-0
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:34.230
The boy's dad puts his arm on
the shoulder.

8d877333-2d5b-4951-b6e9-908993b83d6a-0
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.050
Of our dad, our character dead.

c3372f81-33b7-46f7-85a7-1a40b0ee3b4e-0
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.450
They're walking along together.

9af61f03-de1f-4202-b5b9-26b612d86edd-0
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.285
They're at the shore. There are
a lot of adorable little row

9af61f03-de1f-4202-b5b9-26b612d86edd-1
01:08:46.285 --> 01:08:46.530
boats.

bb31e85e-d4be-45dc-8e50-d42a41f135df-0
01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:49.960
No water to be found. I think
these are more flying boats.

783449ee-6bf2-4d8e-8717-bdc1c121be58-0
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:54.240
It looks as though these people
you've met are helpful.

e3c3762a-f446-47d8-bed6-b9b37d370901-0
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.730
Father and the son. We'll see.

d0005616-ecb3-4a9b-92df-f9b7ab64f38c-0
01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.268
OK, they're approaching one of
these boats with a big

d0005616-ecb3-4a9b-92df-f9b7ab64f38c-1
01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:08.190
earthenware.

6d072df8-a2de-4f35-be87-fddb32262c9d-0
01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.601
Container on the bow. And of
course there's some kind of a

6d072df8-a2de-4f35-be87-fddb32262c9d-1
01:09:12.601 --> 01:09:14.030
tail that comes out of it.

3bb0c409-9b92-45c1-8442-8e10ee34fe6b-0
01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.950
And the boy pulls that.

4bdc3cd4-53a4-4431-b0fe-b2d53dc9b7b8-0
01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.689
Creature pulls a creature out of
it, and it's an adorable kind of

4bdc3cd4-53a4-4431-b0fe-b2d53dc9b7b8-1
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.900
fox.

6f29da2a-c214-4997-b907-a5faa08518a7-0
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.080
Shape.

028dfa9f-d06a-4250-ae39-81b5c2602188-0
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:28.140
Almond eyes.

195bba98-3433-4136-958d-2281926949c8-0
01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:30.450


f715f985-2f19-41a1-849b-006d21a5280d-0
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.750
They're introducing

dc7fa972-b8b8-44e6-8859-6fc58a00e5ec-0
01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.410
the two animals to one another.

326a2fda-af73-4d60-946b-f5a96734da11-0
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.276
It's almost like a cat and a dog
kind of thing. They're putting

326a2fda-af73-4d60-946b-f5a96734da11-1
01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:39.730
out food.

e8a0d8ff-869d-43fc-b672-251d98c644ad-0
01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.690
And the two dads have a
conversation.

ff352210-115d-4770-9fd8-5e4425397c66-0
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:52.940
In order to make himself
understood.

b9f886b6-1317-4f71-81d1-18e2da845675-0
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:57.080
Dad #1 draws.

4c4f1764-5285-4f54-90d3-5caebc20059e-0
01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.820
A scene where there's a village.

448e7459-83d6-40f5-a57c-1be6fc7c5d2c-0
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:05.140
And one of those serpent tailed
creatures flying above it.

5aac9154-0d2b-45ca-9ccd-de4aa726d354-0
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.100
He shows it.

5c11f826-aa5b-4a34-aa75-51611dee7d0c-0
01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:12.430
To his newly acquainted dad, who
tells a story.

683ad44c-c793-4adf-91ff-4ee43c44dae1-0
01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:14.870
And.

931bf779-ea61-4b28-b232-7d079980ef27-0
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:18.560
It's quite an important story to
him.

520a856f-9e50-4148-8510-37cd6c01559f-0
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.059
And he looks off into the
distance while he is telling it,

520a856f-9e50-4148-8510-37cd6c01559f-1
01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:23.050
and his eyes get misty.

03c64f2a-469f-4ba2-af02-d578c67fb89d-0
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:26.602
You're seeing it all again as if
he was there, it looks like.

03c64f2a-469f-4ba2-af02-d578c67fb89d-1
01:10:26.602 --> 01:10:27.170
#END_arrival_4

7acca293-7d6a-45ae-b6b5-54fcdb20ddaa-0
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.790
I don't know how helpful that's
going to be.

e8706c2a-d480-4573-b571-e1d9612edb22-0
01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:32.400
Hmm.

d7aacaf4-cc6f-4f64-a1a2-ab5db44c4d63-0
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:40.790
Whoops, I can't hear you.

db644671-fac0-4095-8c78-8fef251b80e7-0
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:47.660
Next is another short story. I'm
going to pull it up. OK. Thanks.

a5740aa1-9e65-4bfa-a717-835895d1f109-0
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:53.820
OK, I'll share my screen.

d38cb0fa-fcc7-4fac-b756-19ce30f553e0-0
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:00.920
No.

766cf4be-da99-46f9-a8f8-98052592cd8b-0
01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.600
OK, same thing as before.

c459a980-75ea-4456-ab92-43d56bcb6295-0
01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.829
Just tell me when you want.
Wait, let me just make sure.

c459a980-75ea-4456-ab92-43d56bcb6295-1
01:11:14.829 --> 01:11:15.780
Yeah, that was fine.

ab169ba0-5a1e-4a1f-aa4f-71f9a8d4c1c0-0
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.440
There we go.

351c7e0f-71c9-4e24-997f-9ff9b79839ea-0
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:20.900
Tell me when you would like me
to move on with each page.

acfd477f-ccbb-4f09-a783-3500c5e0fa5f-0
01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.190
Thanks.

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:28.904
#START_wanderer So there's what
looks like a devil in the upper

84588818-7ade-484d-a841-55e2d2be0b27-1
01:11:28.904 --> 01:11:32.290
left hand corner, but it's a
helpful devil and.

3cd72aab-f0c4-4862-849b-fd8208c22233-0
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:36.300
There's a boy or a man in a
striped shirt.

5f761ea8-418e-42a8-a121-553f1e66d28f-0
01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.976
Trying to fold something, it
looks like a giant piece of

5f761ea8-418e-42a8-a121-553f1e66d28f-1
01:11:41.976 --> 01:11:43.340
paper and they're.

3a9d92d8-6a41-4e92-95b0-52e90b1903a8-0
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:48.514
Working on this together and
what they've made is some kind

3a9d92d8-6a41-4e92-95b0-52e90b1903a8-1
01:11:48.514 --> 01:11:49.510
of a hat shape.

cd8e7f57-6327-4597-84bf-e23d94a54b61-0
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:52.670
And they're carrying it.

14e9309d-1417-4f51-9c13-a68aebb30a41-0
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:58.440
And it's not a hat, but a boat,
it turns out.

70e27ac2-9eb0-4914-b563-34e65122c67f-0
01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:03.338
And in the next on the next page
here, we're seeing a giant

70e27ac2-9eb0-4914-b563-34e65122c67f-1
01:12:03.338 --> 01:12:04.220
sailing ship.

1b83ad93-bc38-4df2-8788-8358f4bd0fa4-0
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.931
Heading out to sea with this
paper boat that they've made

1b83ad93-bc38-4df2-8788-8358f4bd0fa4-1
01:12:08.931 --> 01:12:10.190
floating towards it.

d6af21ed-41a4-47ae-87b9-115dd9a26e86-0
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:13.240
{OK. Next page. Thanks.}

0b0572b4-d22d-4c40-80f7-12cee16c4df1-0
01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:19.268
And above all of this is a flock
of beautiful sea birds. They

0b0572b4-d22d-4c40-80f7-12cee16c4df1-1
01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:20.540
look like gannets.

9242b8b2-eb95-4fb3-b7ea-d14a337442ef-0
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:22.550
And down below.

e8bd2c94-2de0-4f52-924a-3c35d6341074-0
01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:24.800
Is the paper boat.

3dae7364-800e-44e1-82f8-8de5bdec1f5d-0
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:30.465
And it's floating unbelievably
well. It even looks like there's

3dae7364-800e-44e1-82f8-8de5bdec1f5d-1
01:12:30.465 --> 01:12:34.991
a wake. It's creating a wake as
it moves on, but there are there

3dae7364-800e-44e1-82f8-8de5bdec1f5d-2
01:12:34.991 --> 01:12:37.010
are a wave, so it's got some.

bac8fe63-8d74-4b10-983e-6c00b6acfaa7-0
01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.346
Navigating to do but yeah,
beautiful birds above it.

bac8fe63-8d74-4b10-983e-6c00b6acfaa7-1
01:12:40.346 --> 01:12:42.950
They're they're all heading in
the same direction.

5d4908f4-8346-447b-8fab-a1a872be22c6-0
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.140

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:50.510
And encountering as they sail.

9383c7fd-1a3b-4baf-8cc1-7f45ff11e4c4-0
01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:53.200
Crazy sea creatures.

b3d57d20-270e-412d-8dbb-2cbb14605ad6-0
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:54.990
Turtles.

197549af-a7de-461a-aeb7-fe45d068d15e-0
01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:56.660
OK.

2488e34c-8e62-4854-acd4-2e937a7aaa32-0
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:59.880
Patchwork looking.

887d437f-7a64-448a-8f23-873aeb0f97c8-0
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:03.730
Shells, and they're very curious
about this boat.

d85e8f88-0ed1-4b84-84cb-0df7d7c4d561-0
01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.990
As is.

caed25b6-95c7-49f0-b881-b96d15b66b7e-0
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.610
One of the birds who comes down.

3e0b3628-db0e-41c5-8b20-d7c17e05a499-0
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:12.210
The boat sails on and.

c50c2d32-74a4-494c-9520-b9c310bab680-0
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.897
And encounters a massive object.
It looks like a creature and

c50c2d32-74a4-494c-9520-b9c310bab680-1
01:13:16.897 --> 01:13:18.720
it's rising out of the water.

a943bade-8a34-4b94-9b5a-72305f415d1e-0
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:21.350

49b6dc3e-fbd8-4f27-a3ac-781a8cfb6e44-0
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.189
OK, it's kind of a whale. You
know, from this vantage point,

49b6dc3e-fbd8-4f27-a3ac-781a8cfb6e44-1
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:28.570
it looks like a whale.

7c5dd95f-2924-458d-8760-f8a7155c540e-0
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.550
There's a gorgeous swordfish.

3a0cc0a1-f4b2-470f-8f1c-3a3557e6a3fe-0
01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:34.380

74d5ce3f-6b68-415c-bcc8-8b4ba1b9deed-0
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:39.035
The whale has sort of a mane
that flows from it. Oh my gosh,

74d5ce3f-6b68-415c-bcc8-8b4ba1b9deed-1
01:13:39.035 --> 01:13:42.660
the boat's gotten stuck on the
whale's sprout sprouts brow,

74d5ce3f-6b68-415c-bcc8-8b4ba1b9deed-2
01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.050

01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:52.224
That's a state of affairs, and
there's beautiful undersea life

3055be3f-554e-455b-a268-89af6af6cde9-1
01:13:52.224 --> 01:13:54.020
tubes and fish and.

8393bde1-3a3b-4c8a-a53f-641d21072202-0
01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:59.612
Ferny things and the anemones,
striped fish flowing. But yeah,

8393bde1-3a3b-4c8a-a53f-641d21072202-1
01:13:59.612 --> 01:14:03.341
what a predicament. Who knows
what's going to happen next?

8393bde1-3a3b-4c8a-a53f-641d21072202-2

This page so the whale must have
submerged in the boats.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.920

The tide is low and it seems to
be caught up now on this on the.

01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:32.270
That's interesting.

01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:37.540
It's still sailing.

There's.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:48.271
Crazy kind of Mane, like a sea
urchin mane attached to this

741dd18e-f22a-4b6c-9a60-ea75e8411b68-1
01:14:48.271 --> 01:14:50.700
boat, to the boat now and then.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.145
All that activity down below,
somehow a fishing rod has

69db59ff-55dd-4b5b-b519-4059544a2a20-1
01:14:56.145 --> 01:14:59.901
appeared. We're not seeing
anyone using it, but it's caught

69db59ff-55dd-4b5b-b519-4059544a2a20-2
01:14:59.901 --> 01:15:00.340
a fish.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.240
As it moves along.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.580
Yeah, I don't know what happened
to the fish, but a seahorse

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.605
Interested. And is wearing a
crazy little paper hat on its

3800af9c-da64-4038-924e-45eafafd9152-1
01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:24.040
head, just like the boat.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.241
All the creatures are getting
interested in this boat and

01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:31.020
there's a sea snake trying to
get on board, it looks like.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:36.280
They might be going to take it
over. {So yeah, next page.}

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:48.664
Gorgeous foliage coming up out
of the sea with what looks like

0529b3d4-9043-4c59-95ba-1a663be095ac-1
01:15:48.664 --> 01:15:49.720

a sea forest.

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:59.051

new passengers, is sailing

And the boat's getting into
interesting territory, the

4bc82bc8-ac75-4445-80eb-7e93f99f7fd5-1
01:16:18.075 --> 01:16:19.350

there's, there's.

8fedecec-6b95-4764-bb09-eabfb317b2b2-0

Arms and fingers extending from
some of these.

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:14.210
Below, and it cranes over itself
over the bow.

some kind of a seahorse riding a

01:17:19.643 --> 01:17:20.180
lobster.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.440
And the lobsters' tentacles.

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.820
are extending up above.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.870
Up above the water at, you know,
like surface.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:33.049
And the seahorse cranes his neck
to see what's happening down

696b97d9-b7e8-419c-8649-eddbee77235c-1
01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:33.370
below.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.370
And then?

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:41.458
Has found more of its kind, more
seahorses, just like itself, and

ac9800eb-e292-48b5-9da8-f4759927ed1d-1
01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:44.980
it jumps out of the boat, losing
its hat in the process.

b77dbf86-7ac3-4029-bdf8-5b37bedf8626-0
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:48.480

creatures.

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:51.350
that it understands.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.780
There's one of those massive
whales.

86395cba-fedd-4539-a703-474338c4d7fd-0
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.060
And it's.

19df74fc-835a-4ddd-a75d-764acbbcdae3-0
01:17:56.850 --> 01:18:00.288

are swimming swim upright,

19df74fc-835a-4ddd-a75d-764acbbcdae3-1
01:18:00.288 --> 01:18:00.690
totally

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.210
Different than the ones we're
used to seeing.

01:18:04.190 --> 01:18:08.040
And the tentacle on the top of
this whale's head.

01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:11.730
Works like a fishing rod or
something.

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:16.100
He's dangling something to show
to the boat.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:25.128
Oh, my gosh. Standing on top of
all the boats he's captured. Oh,

bc541785-d099-45fa-9714-c0b8d97f878b-1
01:18:25.128 --> 01:18:28.990
boy, this is dangerous. {All
right, next page.}

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:33.840
What has happened? Where's the
boat? So the boat's.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.520
Been captured it looks like.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.630
And it's been a chaotic area.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.390
These.

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:49.620
Sea animals looking like zebras
and leopards and elephants.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.300
All dwell here, and crazy flying
objects.

01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.960
Looks.

a8db6061-9ee8-4af8-9bde-23004d39fdfc-0
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.630
Like our little boats in
trouble.

e1ae0f95-0f32-4151-abcf-6b30a09b158d-0
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:05.780
Yep, there's even a king. A Sea
King snake.

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:09.350
Doesn't look good. Better check

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:13.960
It survived.

cd077775-5f29-487c-af11-3b014b44af6d-0
01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:19.801
The boat sails off into a
beautiful starry night with a

cd077775-5f29-487c-af11-3b014b44af6d-1
01:19:19.801 --> 01:19:21.100
Crescent moon ahead and.

d362c718-ef54-4972-bea3-815689b7ca36-0
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:25.449
All the little sea creatures
kind of guiding it along, I'd

d362c718-ef54-4972-bea3-815689b7ca36-1
01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:26.690
say it's very lucky.

14adb925-cf04-442b-856a-94e95a8c48d9-0
01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:28.130
to have escaped.

c3885d47-b51f-480b-b06e-44b27a9a65cd-0
01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:33.310
This might be the end. Nope. OK.

cb920806-47e9-43ec-9d3d-5c5f0aae4cc8-0
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.540
Massive number of fish.

2d917f7d-df2f-474d-a05d-4c11cfa82e67-0
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.340
Are gathered around the boat.

5fb97695-03c0-427c-99a6-ccdf9fa55478-0
01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.190
As the boat sails on.

923bb25e-e3e5-4913-b483-d1797207f622-0
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:50.980
And what appears to be.

651248cc-4dce-4491-acb2-74ac78adbb0f-0
01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:51.970
An

01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:54.410
A curtain hanging above.

a66fe050-e1ec-41a1-9d8e-a17b5e99d969-0
01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.580
Coming down from the sky.

c62ede88-5806-4205-a79c-277dd4ec4d74-0
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:58.590
Who knows why?

732719ae-bad0-43f0-b0ee-b5c9f94326dd-0
01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:03.592
The whale's periscope's ahead of
it. Who knows. The whale's

732719ae-bad0-43f0-b0ee-b5c9f94326dd-1
01:20:03.592 --> 01:20:06.460
taking care of things now. {Yep,
next page.}

77a9218c-b394-40ab-bfb6-27a8abc4195a-0

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:11.450
Well, it's like the Rock of
Gibraltar.

ac08dedc-547e-4edd-9a93-9b44a90a975a-0
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.700
So.

50d8799e-ee90-4a8f-9ee3-213683842833-0
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:19.747
what looked like a mane or
curtain hanging is just the

50d8799e-ee90-4a8f-9ee3-213683842833-1
01:20:19.747 --> 01:20:20.280
edges.

1babf188-acbd-4ee0-a898-3fe1670593eb-0
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.070
The circumference of a rock.

3049ae56-7d86-4a76-8c27-c11c7e281cb7-0
01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:27.579
Rugged rock. It looks like this
might be the Mediterranean. The

3049ae56-7d86-4a76-8c27-c11c7e281cb7-1
01:20:27.579 --> 01:20:30.502
ancient Mediterranean or
something. Hard to say, and

3049ae56-7d86-4a76-8c27-c11c7e281cb7-2
01:20:30.502 --> 01:20:33.921
there's still a lot of waves,
but the little paper boat is on

3049ae56-7d86-4a76-8c27-c11c7e281cb7-3
01:20:33.921 --> 01:20:35.190
its own again, sailing.

b02da0a3-98af-49ef-abe1-a043d6ae249e-0
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:41.270
It comes to.

26ffc3a8-df1a-4523-87ae-dee6ffa91b7d-0
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.380
An opening in the rock.

68fadbbe-8f96-4e02-96e9-ba422c97ec9b-0
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.950
What look like icebergs
floating.

116ace79-1647-4141-a773-01dfaa3afe3c-0
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:54.060
And then it sets down this
tunnel of arches.

0f33fdb2-cea8-4be9-93df-215c36a64363-0
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:57.460
Beautiful.

1eddced5-93d8-4089-9a0f-d3421c8e7385-0
01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:02.000
OK, let's come out into the
open.

1b189f44-166a-4d25-ace9-855b6e8c29bb-0
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:03.810
And.

dcfb5aaf-e38f-456d-b8f3-dd31761bd292-0
01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:12.042
There' creatures coming up that
shines creatures from below kind

dcfb5aaf-e38f-456d-b8f3-dd31761bd292-1
01:21:12.042 --> 01:21:14.040
of Periscope on a sneaky.

aebc6b26-68dd-4617-86ec-a0e293d9a2e8-0
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.560
You know extension that shines
light.

8e0bb126-be7b-4c2f-b1b4-af1810fd5152-0
01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:25.060
And makes a lit path for the
little boat to sail when we see.

243db0a8-e9b9-4669-ba79-98b3c297ccaa-0
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:29.746
This deep sea diver emerged.
He's giant, and he dwarfs the

243db0a8-e9b9-4669-ba79-98b3c297ccaa-1
01:21:29.746 --> 01:21:30.470
little boat.

cae48caf-690d-4d74-a428-ae6bb4261646-0
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.020
Who knows what's going to happen
from here?

8de1c83f-3443-4fa7-b7fc-770c483460af-0
01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.020
So.

ebc6f82b-145f-48d2-96b5-16836b493938-0
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.670
Now they've.

7055a5e0-dd4f-411a-af2d-09b7976bc1e9-0
01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.010
Encountered 2.

a0e6aa4a-b495-459f-a737-102a2e9190f5-0
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.280
Giant ships, it appears. Oh a
giant ship.

0daa5ece-3b44-4927-ac9b-e282b7cf697c-0
01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:55.040
At least one maybe. I think it
is two and smokestacks going

0daa5ece-3b44-4927-ac9b-e282b7cf697c-1
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:55.500
strong.

25041015-4856-4126-9291-d8a67fe94ebb-0
01:21:56.430 --> 01:22:00.382
They're underway because you can
see the waves at the bow and

25041015-4856-4126-9291-d8a67fe94ebb-1
01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:04.272
flocks of birds has returned.
There's a lot of sea life, you

25041015-4856-4126-9291-d8a67fe94ebb-2
01:22:04.272 --> 01:22:07.460
know, reaching up his tentacles
from below still.

9cb0c3ff-99b9-491a-bae6-51a94e0ae961-0
01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:10.070
{OK, next one.}

5f181a11-281d-4bc5-9b9b-04e5e8250b2c-0
01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:13.960
And.

3c79d2f3-ddae-47d3-8be1-d05a5eb52afd-0
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:16.780
These birds.

aabc75b5-87a3-4ab2-a03d-3a17aaafa678-0
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:23.510
Birds are diving or dying, I
can't tell which.

79f20166-99c6-4b9a-90f8-4e4ac92628de-0
01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:27.640
One seems to be on our boat.

314cb14a-5720-4626-8ed6-e1d1a1dd2fcd-0
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:29.910
Then.

30cf4284-4eea-445b-8491-2a940fded0c2-0
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.970
The boat seems to have
disappeared.

03e7fa5e-4a68-4e79-a6f0-656b58d5ec53-0
01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:36.300
I don't know what happened.
What's happened?

a6c9b78d-7ab3-444e-8736-4c255e11906d-0
01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.110
But.

65319d3b-a4a6-4421-a656-9da82f08bc36-0
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:44.390
The ship perhaps is up ahead, or
it might be a new city because

65319d3b-a4a6-4421-a656-9da82f08bc36-1
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:46.820
it looks as though it's on
pedestals.

2d2b9325-b405-4eee-877d-b77108ade579-0
01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:49.490


7963fec8-6741-4418-ab13-da006b7e7d13-0
01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.920
Better look at the next one. I
don't know what's happening.

145e1529-628e-445e-b0dd-113e4cc8a44c-0
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:57.860
OK, Yep. Ohh boy and.

4ae10d23-9841-4d73-b150-e6da457e3f1e-0
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.500
They're in dangerous territory.

ac489669-6c96-4f92-9622-105c8b2d8daf-0
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.140
The boat is the ship.

6e1dfa0a-dac6-4169-b12b-eba0a3e0db60-0
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:06.720
has.

89b05b5a-4934-4eef-a551-096aafaf76f0-0
01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:13.240
People, creatures firing at our
boat and its helpers.

bcefbadb-c41a-4bb9-aeac-bc9d7764dcd0-0
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:15.060
Luckily.

d1bd6056-dca2-481c-8387-2f3f358f5fdd-0
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.980
The deep sea diver.

b1c4436c-da94-4202-97be-3240571d0a85-0
01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.440
Throws a life preserver.

f2e5223d-39e6-4118-8d8d-6924f75128ea-0
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.800
At our little boat to try to
keep it afloat.

122f2bb7-8df4-4f68-81fb-65811453910a-0
01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:27.200
Crazy.

2e27b5d5-c922-46e7-9265-81000b8ce3fb-0
01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:28.540
Right.

f3182c22-cdd0-455f-b1a9-6fdeef9e0bea-0
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:35.400
They're

02552283-94e0-43f2-9ef0-3625c5662e3a-0
01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.740
They're making it through the
bounding waves.

6c4c0dab-9b3e-4da8-9926-f87335b23d39-0
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:43.450
The deep sea diver and the boat.

64f2fdab-8075-48a1-bc88-8be0242a8d32-0
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:47.820
And next thing you know,
encountering.

67d518a0-aa88-466b-8ba0-a7ffbce3fe69-0
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:54.860
a crazy group here horses and
court jesters and the devil who

67d518a0-aa88-466b-8ba0-a7ffbce3fe69-1
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.171
helped devil like creature who
helped fold the boat in the

67d518a0-aa88-466b-8ba0-a7ffbce3fe69-2
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:02.460
first place it looks like and
they're being.

02537559-23a7-4d3f-bc91-5ba89fbf1dfd-0
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:05.940
They're using as a sail a kite.

f065c61a-4755-40d2-8f67-f88e56464864-0
01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:08.140
A suspended kite.

ff75948f-4221-4e2f-876f-ca5eb43e84be-0
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:12.150
The boat itself is a seashell.

82ac6655-6767-4058-b0d5-1309f258ad67-0
01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.920
Maybe they'll be helpful.

c379b1ec-1dcb-41f8-ba7e-70bcccb10dd6-0
01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:26.300
{Yeah, next page.} Oh boy. So
then this huge vortex opens up.

dbe92d08-cb10-4010-b06e-08de001672c0-0
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:29.120
Yikes. It's.

a64c63d2-15ae-49ed-ac52-167ac666ea1f-0
01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:33.320
Frightening there are mammoth
waves and our little boat is.

5e350246-7273-464a-bad1-bca673658f5d-0
01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:39.453
Trying to keep afloat as it goes
up the vertical edge, vertical

5e350246-7273-464a-bad1-bca673658f5d-1
01:24:39.453 --> 01:24:40.940
sides of the wave.

896b854a-19b5-4de3-bc6c-33634d0475b8-0
01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.020
And the.

677e3a30-e1c6-4a8f-a780-d0170201d16b-0
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.270
Additional boat.

947dc8cb-97e8-48ea-8856-14c6c07800e5-0
01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:50.041
The sail, I mean the kite for
sail is just destroyed. The

947dc8cb-97e8-48ea-8856-14c6c07800e5-1
01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:51.200
kites come apart.

f42a4db7-a2af-4bbf-81ab-18ab43e6d39d-0
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:53.130
There are two kids.

b8438066-68d3-4f2b-b0fa-45f64d6c76b1-0
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.330
And it's

fab00eec-a760-4314-94cd-a8977f2c688c-0
01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.620
Dangerous territory.

53f4dd13-9b39-45fc-9a6d-e60a97388492-0
01:24:58.730 --> 01:24:59.600
Huge storm.

57660a7e-827a-440c-84a6-c69150834a17-0
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:05.890
Yeah, paper airplane.

1c064d03-16da-4f6f-9c2f-8cd963214375-0
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:07.520
So.

4873276b-c965-4329-8bb9-45081232f6e3-0
01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:11.630
The deep sea diver fashioned a
paper airplane.

f711ee87-e112-4d18-abae-87f8cb9a46fa-0
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.890
When

3286c99a-5a75-411b-a520-33749ea858ab-0
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:17.130
Their kite got destroyed and
they couldn't keep up with the

3286c99a-5a75-411b-a520-33749ea858ab-1
01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:17.370
boat.

93fa7e1b-ae5d-4f5d-a4d4-fbdea8b220d1-0
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:22.958
There's lightning and waves and
clouds and the paper airplane is

93fa7e1b-ae5d-4f5d-a4d4-fbdea8b220d1-1
01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:26.230
underway. Maybe going to save
our little hat boat.

de17af3a-307f-4663-b1e7-1c125f55f88b-0
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.640
Not sure.

681b8f06-4aa5-403d-af9d-1d88e830780a-0
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.230
OK.

0aa63327-91b0-4b09-9c6b-4eb9923dcb0a-0
01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.660
More crazy territory.

5f4c69bc-619c-41ca-b22a-626a0d134751-0
01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:41.660
This some kind of a sea snake
has caught the airplane.

e0f2189b-60cd-4bad-a681-84f38deda8f1-0
01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:50.201
Snatched it out of the sky as
our boat moves its way down

e0f2189b-60cd-4bad-a681-84f38deda8f1-1
01:25:50.201 --> 01:25:50.670
below.

a21c4c25-dc6e-46a5-877b-5e6de8ad75ef-0
01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:52.600
Doesn't look good.

2625cb7d-3f60-4f4a-b957-613c6a1b1379-0
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.570
{New next page. Thanks.}

d9dc1e82-9312-4216-b81a-0079d91d797e-0
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.600
Yeah the sea, sea snakes.

03813554-b104-48f5-932b-6dcaa8aef59c-0
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.590
are gesturing. Maybe they're
helpful.

b2e160dd-a304-46ad-8957-e79a71ea36d5-0
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.880
And our little hat boat makes
its way through a tunnel.

3fa68090-d3f8-4573-ba1f-ac25a5670ff1-0
01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:13.300
of Snakey loops.

e795ca0f-8b56-4fc7-9dec-9e5006b77087-0
01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:21.983
Looks like it's heading for day

areas.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.850
Yep, it's come out into the
open.

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:32.880
All these characters.

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:38.990
There's a very funky island,
perhaps.

469cfd0a-e48f-409a-9c55-daecbe94e22c-0
01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:43.400
Oh, what was happening there?
OK, so on the first page, the

469cfd0a-e48f-409a-9c55-daecbe94e22c-1
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.800
first page is on the left.

2b8f8c0a-ee81-4a50-bd4b-ef5a65232ec8-0
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.150
The sea snakes are.

04aabffd-ad55-4448-8c3c-beb0307f5061-0
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.240
Pouring water.

0958dd6c-6051-4e51-ab86-dd5cd06a4688-0
01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:51.920
Into the hat boat.

faf432d6-2b34-4966-86e4-e3de4bb74502-0
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:54.300
I don't know if they're trying
to sink it.

5fd34248-9555-4fb5-99dd-98328b219c0f-0
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.860
It's really hard to say, but
somehow it stays afloat.

b7e1ede6-77e6-4f4f-87a0-147eddeafa13-0
01:26:58.890 --> 01:26:59.960
And avoids this.

fd114cef-8003-4062-9a31-61491c89f414-0
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:03.780
Horrible island littered.

5485534f-aa18-4b88-b87c-adf88a1399f8-0
01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:06.670
An inhabitant inhabited by.

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:11.439
Creatures. The whole new kind of
fly. It's a flying fish, that's

0b0e6579-ad05-4bd2-a289-f03a106bf2fe-1
01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:14.670
what it is, isn't it? Wearing a
striped bathing suit.

d3576a9f-6b95-4cbd-bdef-703a0566ca6d-0
01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.879
But it looks like our little
boat has escaped again. I don't

d3576a9f-6b95-4cbd-bdef-703a0566ca6d-1
01:27:18.879 --> 01:27:19.260
know how.

01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:21.850
{Better see the next page.}

01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:27.190
Sea urchins galore.

3e4f1f32-1f5c-44fc-a800-d12f204b35e4-0
01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:32.061
Jellyfish. Jellyfish it's. so
yeah, it's in a sea of

3e4f1f32-1f5c-44fc-a800-d12f204b35e4-1
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:34.730
jellyfish. That happens
sometimes.

66b748d7-fc1f-4e65-8274-aa73bed3572a-0
01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:36.240
But.

b0678b84-e2a3-4a45-8a91-4dd07a619b7d-0
01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:41.400
Can the little boat survive that
much mass of?

af52c9d8-a689-4764-866e-43d5ae25001f-0
01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.730
Sea, blubber and tentacle.

a0cc0737-c7e1-4ed5-be5e-b89f0bd211a9-0
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.714
I'm not seeing it on the second
page. {You better go in the

next.}

01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.990
Yeah, that's it. It's sunk. It's
underwater now.

9d0ec649-b99e-4ec7-a51c-18cf3569d79b-0
01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.440
It's in the world of.

328facbe-a539-40c5-87d6-7d0db913e2ed-0
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:58.060
Jellyfish and sea urchins and.

8388ca1c-a951-4e02-9528-70ad119eaca9-0
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.240
All these weird.

e7cef291-49da-4c0c-80ce-ce08cb3174d8-0
01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.020
Creatures.

c738b1ea-d14e-4ca1-9d57-c8f8d89f6aef-0
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.050
{OK, next page.}

01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:10.240
Ohh, it's been.

b5755281-8c21-46ff-a12b-fd8b08c2de1b-0
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.800
Taken over

325af06b-a31e-43c9-ac80-a9ae2c8627e3-0
01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.755
by these sea creatures who look
like they're going to be eating

325af06b-a31e-43c9-ac80-a9ae2c8627e3-1
01:28:16.755 --> 01:28:16.880
it.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.560
However.

1589cafb-c3f3-4ef3-91f2-0b36bcbd2251-0
01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.900
Unbelievably.

99813e62-b313-4f28-8e65-bece150a2e87-0
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:28.520
There's been some kind of a ship
fashioned and the boat is on.

4bf45a8d-a102-4485-98f2-4df41292fe22-0
01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.469
Its forward point, wow. And it
looks like it's going to get

4bf45a8d-a102-4485-98f2-4df41292fe22-1
01:28:33.469 --> 01:28:34.110
launched.

9a47af90-30bd-4d40-806a-71d54a52fbb6-0
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.670
Who knows how that happened?

a5956d8b-2795-4489-b600-4832ba0d65c1-0
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.430
Yep, above water again.

9e7b561e-a1f4-4945-b96a-0b24e58f356a-0
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:47.977
The day is saved and it's kind
of being delivered, pouring

9e7b561e-a1f4-4945-b96a-0b24e58f356a-1
01:28:47.977 --> 01:28:50.770
water out of its, out of its
deck.

89b8ccf0-2dac-48cd-bdb6-0a5ff154cf07-0
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:56.140
And lo and behold, it's quite
close to this.

8a7059dd-3286-4712-8c64-e5a83e0773b6-0
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:59.580
Fishing boat. Maybe it's a
friendly fishing boat.

55f4f104-ca15-4b53-9b6a-a0eaba0b1ccb-0
01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:05.590
Yeah.

8d0d37aa-7d26-4cc4-af53-3288906cb381-0
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:11.921
Some seals get a hold of it.
They're definitely playing with

8d0d37aa-7d26-4cc4-af53-3288906cb381-1
01:29:11.921 --> 01:29:14.100
it. Seals never take life
seriously.

b76b9db2-0974-40a7-9ac2-cab21ab47b0d-0
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.980
Holding it aloft and.

9c438b01-ffc1-47a1-8fcf-79543f60bf6d-0
01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:23.860
And on that next page.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.130
Yeah, beautiful scenery.

154f4e4d-7dbc-4e4e-8e94-8be9cd997516-0
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:28.720
There's hope. It's daytime.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.860
Little boat continues.

efcf9e15-2823-4d26-a2ef-5b3a5518b6dc-0
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:35.660
And.

10d50aac-d333-4057-8746-bdca2c6468b4-0
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:38.270
Before you know it is directly
over.

57f99a1b-2b88-4948-b1d9-bcca985c526a-0
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:41.960
a deep sea diver.

768fc984-78dd-4af3-ba13-f353f63378af-0
01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:45.940
Whatever he's doing down below
there, it's always interesting.

d3eb67fe-3324-4093-a1dc-c56716a2d65a-0
01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.795
I've never seen anyone on board
our little boat other than sea

d3eb67fe-3324-4093-a1dc-c56716a2d65a-1
01:29:51.795 --> 01:29:53.130
animals that it encounters.

b313bb5f-c6e1-46eb-b39d-2c6daef9b719-0
01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:57.330
But yeah, and there's some light
being cast off from whatever

b313bb5f-c6e1-46eb-b39d-2c6daef9b719-1
01:29:57.330 --> 01:30:00.473
that deep sea diver is doing
down below because it it's

b313bb5f-c6e1-46eb-b39d-2c6daef9b719-2
01:30:00.473 --> 01:30:01.540
casting his shadow.

404086a5-09f7-490b-83b3-fd818311f7dc-0
01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:04.800
Of onto what's behind him.

52254e80-07cb-4223-bbf7-b2375c72b433-0
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:07.330
Interesting.

237e0de2-372e-4a6c-afe7-a1c39d353e4b-0
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.190
{OK, next page.}

253635c3-a3d1-4c17-9cd8-0d5b0f6e806c-0
01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:17.700
Yep, everybody's there. They're,
they are on a navigational buoy.

001c8320-b927-4e75-b7a8-39fcd8c6819c-0
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:20.320
Everyone's sitting and relaxing.

a32d9193-fc41-4bc4-8d0f-1dbaa8448211-0
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:24.420
Quite a cast of characters. The
birds are back.

2ba5520d-04c0-4a1e-984c-9ef20f30910e-0
01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:26.420
And.

baae1e30-2134-42b5-b7cb-e545fc61d3bf-0
01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.544
Our little boat is somehow still
afloat, but it does have a

baae1e30-2134-42b5-b7cb-e545fc61d3bf-1
01:30:30.544 --> 01:30:33.965
little dot on it now that I've
never seen before. Maybe some

baae1e30-2134-42b5-b7cb-e545fc61d3bf-2
01:30:33.965 --> 01:30:37.161
kind of a badge for having
survived everything it's been

baae1e30-2134-42b5-b7cb-e545fc61d3bf-3
01:30:37.161 --> 01:30:37.610
through.

a3db962c-9482-4a4e-a952-7632ae3587c3-0
01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.600
And and.

8572d7d0-4060-4a60-9132-8aaff2c4491b-0
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:44.776
It continues floating to the
point where it's approaching a

8572d7d0-4060-4a60-9132-8aaff2c4491b-1
01:30:44.776 --> 01:30:45.990
beautiful lighthouse.

7bccdba5-e7ad-47c8-9105-7de2ed54dbb3-0
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.040
And some boats, some ships.

a79b24ee-1f47-4aa8-addd-f1abe59b22c0-0
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.224
As well. So our little boat
might be coming into a harbor

a79b24ee-1f47-4aa8-addd-f1abe59b22c0-1
01:30:53.224 --> 01:30:54.700
now from the looks of it.

5f854c12-13fc-4271-87bc-642e0a9261bb-0
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:02.160
Wild, yeah.

2689b3ae-5e23-46e7-8c39-241656645e41-0
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:03.630
Yeah.

a85f2b6a-7611-414a-b21e-b7c10f4b67a5-0
01:31:06.730 --> 01:31:07.310
Approaching.

44037cdb-eb9c-4678-9816-c14dfc100e22-0
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:11.340
Entering a harbor with a lot of
building.

f9c89ace-f7e0-404c-9827-0db43181cc5a-0
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:13.190
Crazy.

bc09d6b2-78d2-473f-b475-25d9ea93117a-0
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:15.820
Bridge like.

04708895-71bf-437a-be4b-3f0e880ffe2b-0
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:17.560
Construction.

965c0998-ff74-4745-835b-fa9b67c3a17c-0
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.570
Yeah, whole new world. We'll see
how things go.

59ec9672-d2d1-4796-9401-536a2fc19a42-0
01:31:27.730 --> 01:31:32.445
It's found itself quite close to
a massive ship, very near a

59ec9672-d2d1-4796-9401-536a2fc19a42-1
01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:34.610
tugboat headed right for it.

5d6712c9-c0fc-4841-8695-fdadaf4b7fdc-0
01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:37.060
Yeah.

95698f85-9258-465b-8244-6a081631bda5-0
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:43.473
The little ship that saved it is
down below, still on the same

95698f85-9258-465b-8244-6a081631bda5-1
01:31:43.473 --> 01:31:47.197
course. It looks like perhaps
they're keeping track of things

95698f85-9258-465b-8244-6a081631bda5-2
01:31:47.197 --> 01:31:50.080
in case our little paper boat
needs help again.

582ea93e-20ab-411d-b1a4-76f2c1d3ab1d-0
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:59.516
And everyone's coming into port.

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:10.907
There is an absolutely wacky
boat that looks like it's made

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.970
So it's not a tugboat, it was a
fishing boat.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.540

stairway from the pier.

01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:36.893
And a sailor or or someone is
meeting it. Seabirds flying all

179ef592-07e7-45de-9014-998cd808ef25-1

01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:23.315
seen it once before. For a
moment he's looking at things

5f44cc9b-1ba3-47bd-918c-12aa20ff5956-2
01:34:23.315 --> 01:34:26.923
from above, but our little boat
is making its way down the

5f44cc9b-1ba3-47bd-918c-12aa20ff5956-3
01:34:26.923 --> 01:34:27.290

01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:42.942
Fascinating. And what looked
like the devil is on a horse, a

6d552c7d-b21e-4b12-8186-24b6e0d39720-1
01:34:42.942 --> 01:34:44.000
polka dot horse.

Crescent moon.

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:52.633
Piercing his head so his horns
have changed nature. Unless I'm

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:01.754
Coming down the canal. Maybe
we're coming home. I don't know.

6e3e2662-0faf-4bdb-84ff-37865d7e6182-1
01:35:01.754 --> 01:35:03.250
Creatures everywhere.

01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:11.840
Beautiful starry sky.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.150
Still traveling.

Under another bridge.

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:21.730
"Actineow." And the boat that's
helped him out.

01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:24.750
Seems to be.

think.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.399
There's a building, a little bit
of a house shape to it being lit

67767753-f18d-4c2a-a049-b684c002d9d0-1
01:35:44.399 --> 01:35:47.250
up by a street light with
nothing else visible.

288af8d2-851e-4ad4-98cc-b6d747b7115b-0
01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.370
It's all on its own.

01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:52.620
So we float right up there.

876c2255-a0c9-4787-846c-b03952038da5-0
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:55.440
To the stairway.

dabcd13e-c357-40cf-85ba-6e7056dfe34d-0
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:58.910
And is it possible?

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:05.377
Oh my gosh. So there's been a
creature on board our boat all

98bedf68-63d8-415c-8bad-a95c7fcd6257-1
01:36:05.377 --> 01:36:06.300

01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:12.340
And this creature

5afd2a58-4ca0-485d-bdfe-9c3b6ae99eaa-0
01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.670
Comes out and climbs the stairs.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.670
ascends them and.

01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:25.170
Is talking to someone who's a
white person. There is artwork

255e9076-ca5b-4b1b-ba9d-238472e87cc7-1
01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:26.280
on the dark person.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.476
And they seem to be having a
conversation on the top.

706de77c-5088-4708-894c-27d5679c8597-1

01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:38.772
female giants are just cut outs.
They're wooden cutouts and

01:37:38.772 --> 01:37:39.910
they're waving.

01:37:54.724 --> 01:37:57.529
were horribly harassing the
little people.}

a5fa146a-b642-47c2-87d6-b435b59a4daa-0
01:37:59.110 --> 01:38:01.080
Oh my gosh, now I see the little
people.

5b29e899-77d2-4629-a863-5ef52e02df00-0
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:04.420
I thought it was flowers.
Sheesh.

bedb0614-1e1c-4fe0-b044-4bcb9cb95ba8-0
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:08.630
So the Giants are doing
everything in their power to

bedb0614-1e1c-4fe0-b044-4bcb9cb95ba8-1
01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:10.240
torment the little people.

b6439c50-1440-4923-a072-bfb1b80a418a-0
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:13.310
They're shaking them out of the
trees.

9ba60473-4f75-4cd4-9162-35c65de2a832-0
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:16.670
They're plucking them out of the
castles.

19602d06-6f67-4241-858c-23da695d214e-0
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.920
They're disturbing their
windmills.

0bef719f-92ac-48e2-8342-26496e99f827-0
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:26.330
Going into the fields and it
looks like they're up to no good

0bef719f-92ac-48e2-8342-26496e99f827-1
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.920
there also.

65f286a4-a6bc-47c3-a76f-bbc7a4875c5a-0
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:32.070
Giants really are massive. One
of their feet could crush three

65f286a4-a6bc-47c3-a76f-bbc7a4875c5a-1
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:33.090
or four people.

e595b693-ea60-41d0-ab43-9de779117e3a-0
01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.192
And I don't think they're
careful when they move around

e595b693-ea60-41d0-ab43-9de779117e3a-1
01:38:37.192 --> 01:38:38.040
the landscape.

eb615615-1d3c-4585-89fd-487c50f2bf55-0
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:46.268
There's in particular, one giant
who's tucked people captive into

eb615615-1d3c-4585-89fd-487c50f2bf55-1
01:38:46.268 --> 01:38:47.130
his belt.

b4e53df9-b82b-43b0-bb28-947cccbc2cc9-0
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:51.170
As another giant.

374abdb0-68fb-42cd-8591-f2f9cee6c151-0
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.351
Takes a chain around a home and
who knows what he's going to do

374abdb0-68fb-42cd-8591-f2f9cee6c151-1
01:38:57.351 --> 01:38:57.830
with it.

1d60d947-dcc0-4a74-a91f-4a366b8b9f22-0
01:38:58.740 --> 01:38:59.880
Puts the chain around a home.

e606e4fe-da73-43e6-b908-40b9a52666a7-0
01:39:00.850 --> 01:39:05.922
There's a giant on his kneels,
knees kneeling, who doffs his

e606e4fe-da73-43e6-b908-40b9a52666a7-1
01:39:05.922 --> 01:39:09.830
hat in deference to some of the
little people.

1e235ecc-6a2b-4358-aff1-756deae8c683-0
01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:14.392
So maybe there's one friendly
giant from the looks of things.

1e235ecc-6a2b-4358-aff1-756deae8c683-1
01:39:14.392 --> 01:39:14.610
Ohh.

c8882dc3-d204-4212-bc9a-4b1cc7ec480c-0
01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:19.693
Oh no. There may be 2, because
here's a giant with a bouquet of

c8882dc3-d204-4212-bc9a-4b1cc7ec480c-1
01:39:19.693 --> 01:39:20.230
flowers.

4025c95a-8e22-448d-8fa1-b83e190ed564-0
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:22.700
And a heart over his head.

933e001a-1727-4930-b54f-dff20e311a17-0
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:25.700
Who's approaching the

44461d79-5dd6-4393-aa8c-f63f11a40ac9-0
01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.390
Wooden woman.

e5db4c4d-d358-4ed1-9b59-fe1a51c676fa-0
01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.200
Thinks he's in love.

ba06f223-25f8-44f2-a8ec-1112b7930c3e-0
01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:33.560
So he's been distracted from
being an unfriendly giant.

35b1a8db-528a-47c7-8828-3a6e9d2ef300-0
01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.903
And another one over on the
other side doing something

35b1a8db-528a-47c7-8828-3a6e9d2ef300-1
01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:37.270
similar.

6158db98-7d29-492f-8407-aecac1d5f137-0
01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.740
Meanwhile, down. Down. Below.

7c9a0f25-c38d-4066-882b-963cb791029c-0
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:45.259
Hosts of unfriendly giants. I
think six of them are playing

7c9a0f25-c38d-4066-882b-963cb791029c-1
01:39:45.259 --> 01:39:45.610
chess.

258a94e9-eb84-419b-b762-469e3d89220e-0
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.400
With humans. And that can't be
good.

1c910ea9-cf01-407d-a38a-1c4c10a8bc11-0
01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:53.440
And.

4a43c585-9eda-4555-92fc-c74e2296477b-0
01:39:54.190 --> 01:39:58.173
A lot of the humans, some
soldiers have banded together

4a43c585-9eda-4555-92fc-c74e2296477b-1
01:39:58.173 --> 01:40:02.512
and they're starting to torment
and attack the chess playing

4a43c585-9eda-4555-92fc-c74e2296477b-2
01:40:02.512 --> 01:40:03.010
giants.

c439f0b8-aabf-45f2-8a0e-01ed7441560a-0
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:06.640
So, but the giant.

a175aaa6-0213-4a8c-833e-576c7ea74f4b-0
01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:11.496
Like just casually smacks them
all over with his right hand as

a175aaa6-0213-4a8c-833e-576c7ea74f4b-1
01:40:11.496 --> 01:40:13.070
they approach in a group.

8b0535f0-ed75-4169-a936-1b56dc3b6d76-0
01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.030
Doesn't look good. There is a
giant with a peashooter.

093eebaa-a6e1-45c2-8e53-192ca6fc8d49-0
01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:22.750
Firing at one of the little
people's armies.

766b2e2b-8296-4334-9f5d-94d4c0b27ac9-0
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:27.101
And there's another Yep, there
are three peashooters. There you

766b2e2b-8296-4334-9f5d-94d4c0b27ac9-1
01:40:27.101 --> 01:40:27.240
go.

ec856e65-5788-4538-8e89-010273171bab-0
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:32.610
It's not going to turn out well.
And a crazy platform. oh Oh my

ec856e65-5788-4538-8e89-010273171bab-1
01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:36.418
gosh, the little people have
built a platform that wields a

ec856e65-5788-4538-8e89-010273171bab-2
01:40:36.418 --> 01:40:40.478
hammer, and it's about to whack
one of the unfriendly giants in

ec856e65-5788-4538-8e89-010273171bab-3
01:40:40.478 --> 01:40:41.050
the head.

165c1c4e-7200-41f6-9426-18c088e73d73-0
01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:47.105
That's probably the most
creative weapon so far. Oh no,

165c1c4e-7200-41f6-9426-18c088e73d73-1
01:40:47.105 --> 01:40:50.040
oh oh, so that the wooden women.

719f9dd6-d032-4096-8bc8-28a8f658fa19-0
01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:55.001
Are there for a reason. Now I'm
seeing the hammers on platforms

719f9dd6-d032-4096-8bc8-28a8f658fa19-1
01:40:55.001 --> 01:40:55.620
behind them.

4b5b3da7-50eb-41d6-8e02-60d14b6209fd-0
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:59.760
When these unfriendly giants
fall for these ladies, they

4b5b3da7-50eb-41d6-8e02-60d14b6209fd-1
01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.322
approach and get hit over the
head with the swivel swivel

4b5b3da7-50eb-41d6-8e02-60d14b6209fd-2
01:41:03.322 --> 01:41:07.130
hammer. Oh my God, there are
three of them. That's brilliant.

0321085d-356b-4bbd-b3da-34c90cfb0053-0
01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:10.500
Yeah, so there's hope. 

210737a1-e235-4d6c-914a-5b07e6cf59ae-0
01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:12.870
So.

03fa977e-72cd-4571-b760-9d733d9c3c38-0
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:19.380
Yep. No Waldo.

f0de462c-0617-4c58-96a0-7a30c69edddb-0
01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:23.080
Wherever Waldo is, is not there.
