00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.860
OK, so, um, a complex scene.

1ef2d623-af06-4c18-b5ed-ae1ff6895357-0
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.995
You are about to see a complex
scene. Imagine you are

1ef2d623-af06-4c18-b5ed-ae1ff6895357-1
00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:10.620
describing.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.586
This scene to somebody who
cannot see the picture. Describe

7c7bd31b-06f1-4a71-83d4-c202073dcdcb-1
00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:18.540
what is happening and what you
see in the scene.

ea4f47fd-9371-4413-a3ba-1829aa5cee8c-0
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.757
As thoroughly as possible and
then with complex scenes we ask

ea4f47fd-9371-4413-a3ba-1829aa5cee8c-1
00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:29.181
that you take between 3 to 5
minutes to describe each scene.

ea4f47fd-9371-4413-a3ba-1829aa5cee8c-2
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.850
I will have a timer if.

b5ca3eeb-bb69-47c3-bfed-63e9ce372776-0
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.778
Like you need, like if you're
going way over or if you need

b5ca3eeb-bb69-47c3-bfed-63e9ce372776-1
00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:36.110
some.

30c315d9-65f9-417e-a329-6148eedb0873-0
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.330
Need to know.

21122e4f-bc12-485f-b2ea-2e1bc223174f-0
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.080
Like how much left?

e0929ac2-0ca6-4889-bc3a-f9189f8fec60-0
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.060
Umm.

7059c4bd-16d4-4643-9a64-8416b79ceae6-0
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.190
I'm going to pull up your first
scene.

4e346ef5-f66a-4acb-a5ec-e2e0b9cb1748-0
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.180
Wake me up in the morning.

78010de2-fdfc-4bad-81b6-51458acfd312-0
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.050
OK.

228394e4-2338-4aa8-afe8-dc86d58cbbcd-0
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.180
Let me just double check.

187f69e5-0f36-4891-b148-8c9b29129e56-0
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.383
OK, now I will share my screen
and I will put it in a

187f69e5-0f36-4891-b148-8c9b29129e56-1
00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:21.780
presenting mode.

dd55569c-5969-46f7-af50-5cac3764fb7a-0
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.913
All right, you could begin when
you're ready. You know what? I

dd55569c-5969-46f7-af50-5cac3764fb7a-1
00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:30.430
have that circle again.

3ad4aa1a-33a2-4ec4-8da1-596fe12f283e-0
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.330
Getting accept the black screen.
Let me try to reshare.

34516319-c334-4b45-90e7-ff275a26235b-0
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.561
OK, now I see that perfect. OK.
So when you're ready, just start

34516319-c334-4b45-90e7-ff275a26235b-1
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:52.800
to describe what you see.
#START_ancient_rome OK. So this

34516319-c334-4b45-90e7-ff275a26235b-2
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.020
is.

897fca70-eabb-4138-9d2f-35e0a5feea6d-0
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.576
Some sort of a game, it says.
F-V-N and games and ancient Rome

897fca70-eabb-4138-9d2f-35e0a5feea6d-1
00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:01.160
from 2000 years ago.

e5200022-9c29-4d3c-b8bd-5879d274c463-0
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.797
It looks like there is a lot of
fighting going on. They're in a

e5200022-9c29-4d3c-b8bd-5879d274c463-1
00:02:07.797 --> 00:02:13.204
big stadium and there are a
whole bunch of people around in

e5200022-9c29-4d3c-b8bd-5879d274c463-2
00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:17.260
the audience. There are some, it
looks like.

863a9790-c1cf-4f1e-b39a-a84f1aecf3fe-0
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.524
Lions that are getting into the
stands and like getting at the

863a9790-c1cf-4f1e-b39a-a84f1aecf3fe-1
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:26.862
people. So the people are are
running and scattering in the

863a9790-c1cf-4f1e-b39a-a84f1aecf3fe-2
00:02:26.862 --> 00:02:31.417
stands and then down in the the
area where like the stadium or

863a9790-c1cf-4f1e-b39a-a84f1aecf3fe-3
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:36.045
the stage or where everything is
taking place, there is a whole

863a9790-c1cf-4f1e-b39a-a84f1aecf3fe-4
00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:39.660
bunch of stuff going on. So
there's like animals.

3acb7446-3c18-45be-97f8-2d9fe90e948d-0
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.736
There are, there's horses,
there's people fighting, there's

3acb7446-3c18-45be-97f8-2d9fe90e948d-1
00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:52.373
lions that like, look like
they're trying to, you know, get

3acb7446-3c18-45be-97f8-2d9fe90e948d-2
00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:54.910
people or like kill people.

184b62db-b39b-4f5b-b714-f56ff38d4601-0
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.036
There's people that are trying
to crawl out of the the stage or

184b62db-b39b-4f5b-b714-f56ff38d4601-1
00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:05.876
the stadium so it's it's sunk
in. It's like in a big hole and

184b62db-b39b-4f5b-b714-f56ff38d4601-2
00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:10.325
then the stands are are well
above it. So the people are

184b62db-b39b-4f5b-b714-f56ff38d4601-3
00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.979
trying to climb out of that
area.

38ca34d4-f224-4c43-b315-49f673c23b96-0
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.780
There's horses.

3fba00ce-f823-4ff7-8f17-4770feb9a8db-0
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.311
And there's a horse that's like
instead of the people with the

3fba00ce-f823-4ff7-8f17-4770feb9a8db-1
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:27.101
reins and the horse, the horse
has the reins and the people are

3fba00ce-f823-4ff7-8f17-4770feb9a8db-2
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.990
in front of it.

4a7a6e17-c6f7-4ff5-ab93-939690e4b9a2-0
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.090
There's tigers. I believe that's
tigers in there too.

8ba7fc66-d531-4e34-8eac-42c261cd2788-0
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.301
There's people with Shields and
people with like big sticks or

8ba7fc66-d531-4e34-8eac-42c261cd2788-1
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:42.960
swords.

1a03093d-e30c-47af-9cfb-e1629267864b-0
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.570
{Am I at 3 minutes yet?

86160e78-2bcb-43a0-be98-55ff13db5d69-0
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.780
Or keep going.

78179f16-aca9-4b10-8819-5383629bae11-0
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.240
Oh, I can't hear you. I think
you're muted.

d0d97e0d-6de0-43e1-a98a-911e0646a131-0
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.983
You could talk for like one more
minute about it. Yeah. OK.

d0d97e0d-6de0-43e1-a98a-911e0646a131-1
00:04:03.983 --> 00:04:04.650
Alright.}

0d3d0a61-11e9-426c-bdde-8ba36eb9122d-0
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.968
Let's see so it looks like
they're in like like the dirt or

0d3d0a61-11e9-426c-bdde-8ba36eb9122d-1
00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:14.330
something. I don't know. It's
yellow, but it kind of looks

0d3d0a61-11e9-426c-bdde-8ba36eb9122d-2
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.900
like dirt.

82748ed9-22ff-446d-82db-d3212fcd0433-0
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.673
{I'm going to read what the
little page says. It says the

82748ed9-22ff-446d-82db-d3212fcd0433-1
00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:24.729
Romans spent most of their time
fighting, conquering, learning

82748ed9-22ff-446d-82db-d3212fcd0433-2
00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.210
Latin and making roads.

e5a435eb-ef8f-4883-9e0d-75873604fa0a-0
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.240
It's like really tiny. I can't
see it.

8c0979e1-c7ed-43f9-8829-9e97fd085a5f-0
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.840
So.}

5712c724-309d-45ca-9324-5323dd48590c-0
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.166
Apparently this is about 2000
years ago in ancient Rome. Oh,

5712c724-309d-45ca-9324-5323dd48590c-1
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:40.923
they're fighting to the death.
It looks like they are fighting

5712c724-309d-45ca-9324-5323dd48590c-2
00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:44.679
to the death in this scene. Like
everybody is just fighting to

5712c724-309d-45ca-9324-5323dd48590c-3
00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:48.256
the death. And then there's
people there that are observing

5712c724-309d-45ca-9324-5323dd48590c-4
00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:49.329
and watching this.

cc6818a2-a5e6-40df-91d4-6e410f24ce63-0
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.326
People in the stands, so people
on the other side of the stands

cc6818a2-a5e6-40df-91d4-6e410f24ce63-1
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:56.502
where there's not lions chasing
them, are kind of like cheering

cc6818a2-a5e6-40df-91d4-6e410f24ce63-2
00:04:56.502 --> 00:04:56.900
and and.

8c837156-b34a-47b2-b926-142219419d0b-0
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.190
Cheering them on as they fight
to the death.

df467dcb-2d35-4baa-a640-d60588a35d1b-0
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.940
Oh, I think you're muted. I got.
I will pull up our next.

bd73cd9f-75f6-4895-914f-1875a26eea32-0
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.000
Item.

8174a21f-e5f8-44dc-9e44-89a5cbb48d96-0
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.440
OK, our next item is a short
story, so I will pull up the

8174a21f-e5f8-44dc-9e44-89a5cbb48d96-1
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.650
instructions for a short story.
OK.

f13f32cd-a800-43f4-86fc-36d47730918f-0
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.790
OK.

a671916c-ec4f-4771-8c81-df1237f34eaf-0
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.090
Oh, I hit the wrong one.

5eca14b1-9d68-4148-9466-a78c3ec49b7d-0
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.560
There we go.

eaa4ce5c-4a09-489b-a2ab-596a0840678a-0
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.110
OK, so with our graphic novels,
you're going to oh.

6415ba1f-973b-49d0-a515-9cfbaaf11845-0
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.938
That was weird. With our graphic
novels, you are going to look at

6415ba1f-973b-49d0-a515-9cfbaaf11845-1
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.980
a series of pictures that tell a
story.

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-0
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.893
And imagine that you are telling
the story to somebody who cannot

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-1
00:06:03.893 --> 00:06:07.934
see the pictures. Describe what
you see and what is happening as

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-2
00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:11.912
you go throughout the story. And
then with these stories, after

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-3
00:06:11.912 --> 00:06:16.016
you finish a slide or describing
the picture in front of you, you

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-4
00:06:16.016 --> 00:06:19.994
could tell me to move on to the
next page. And then the stories

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-5
00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:23.973
kind of vary on length. So I'm
going to pull up our first story

24571c5b-39fb-463a-8b85-c5c4d424ee56-6
00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:27.020
and I'll let you know how many
slides it is, OK?

a41f36e9-5f9b-4faa-bb59-3892c81519e8-0
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.290
OK.

07285aae-a41e-4e08-a070-411300e2b7a5-0
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:52.330


665ff8ce-f590-4220-b0b0-d2ca29fc8af7-0
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.930
OK, and I'm going to.

9d19425e-f55d-4f8a-80fe-38b2d9adaf15-0
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.540
Share my screen.

3558cbc0-7f42-4c15-98a7-0599fcd74498-0
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.498
And I'm going to put this in
presenting mode. This slide,

3558cbc0-7f42-4c15-98a7-0599fcd74498-1
00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:08.290
this, this story is
approximately 20 slides.

b207f879-48d8-435f-9a8c-fb29d2fb898f-0
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.450
OK, so I should take about 30
seconds to a minute.

c7c83723-dcde-4b4a-8362-9aa4d6bd4935-0
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.975
Yeah, like over for each one,
some slides will have more

c7c83723-dcde-4b4a-8362-9aa4d6bd4935-1
00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:21.876
detailed pictures. Like this
slide has more detailed pictures

c7c83723-dcde-4b4a-8362-9aa4d6bd4935-2
00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:26.028
than some of the other slides in
the story. So like it could vary

c7c83723-dcde-4b4a-8362-9aa4d6bd4935-3
00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:28.230
on how, but just an
approximation.

5b5711fb-1dd9-4d24-b92b-c4d7d603cb13-0
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.550
OK, and I've got the the circle
again and the black screen. Oh,

5b5711fb-1dd9-4d24-b92b-c4d7d603cb13-1
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.340
here, I could reshare it.

93b33123-6635-4477-aa98-785a29df2eb0-0
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.680
OK. Can you see it now? Yes. OK,
perfect.

658a6d44-5500-4c4c-b083-b9442e191a6a-0
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.973
Alright, so start describing
what's going on? Yes.

658a6d44-5500-4c4c-b083-b9442e191a6a-1
00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:01.990
#START_return OK, so so I see it
says for my parents.

5795d5b7-35c8-41db-80b6-3a36c8fc6e7f-0
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.618
The words are a little bit too
small for me to really read but

5795d5b7-35c8-41db-80b6-3a36c8fc6e7f-1
00:08:07.618 --> 00:08:11.018
I'm thinking it's like a
dedication to the author's

5795d5b7-35c8-41db-80b6-3a36c8fc6e7f-2
00:08:11.018 --> 00:08:13.110
parents, and it starts out with.

30651fa7-35ae-48ff-8e70-e3092e96f828-0
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.215
There's a man and he is doing
either some type of art or it

30651fa7-35ae-48ff-8e70-e3092e96f828-1
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:22.160
might be.

c9fddb6e-41c8-4fcd-8f1d-a93a43976c8c-0
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.627
Architecture. It's like a a
slanted desk that he's working

c9fddb6e-41c8-4fcd-8f1d-a93a43976c8c-1
00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:30.580
on and there's a kite coming in
the door.

8d9e0d18-b892-4c29-86ef-4ec095cef9a1-0
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.849
There is a there's like a little
door that is too small for a

8d9e0d18-b892-4c29-86ef-4ec095cef9a1-1
00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:41.479
person to to go into that's
that's on the wall. So that's

8d9e0d18-b892-4c29-86ef-4ec095cef9a1-2
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:46.030
kind of interesting. I'm not
sure what that is and then.

9354baca-95c9-4695-92b8-2b2b74943f18-0
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.712
If we move downstairs, the
downstairs is it's just showing

9354baca-95c9-4695-92b8-2b2b74943f18-1
00:08:51.712 --> 00:08:55.839
a picture of the house so it
looks like the this is actually

9354baca-95c9-4695-92b8-2b2b74943f18-2
00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:56.990
maybe like a big.

c320941b-d927-4856-9358-fe472fd3e5f9-0
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.207
Yep, it looks like it all goes
together. So it's a it's a big

c320941b-d927-4856-9358-fe472fd3e5f9-1
00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:08.035
picture of the house. So the the
man is upstairs. Downstairs

c320941b-d927-4856-9358-fe472fd3e5f9-2
00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:09.460
there's a kitchen.

6f594732-7feb-4cd3-b8ed-4cf3a70e5e67-0
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.572
There's a stove. Upstairs there
is a bedroom. So it looks like

6f594732-7feb-4cd3-b8ed-4cf3a70e5e67-1
00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:19.751
he's working in an office.
There's like a bookshelf there,

6f594732-7feb-4cd3-b8ed-4cf3a70e5e67-2
00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:23.929
a picture on the wall. There's a
light where he's working.

2c90ab1b-9db9-4309-95ea-4350e3713a31-0
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.420
Um, there's a bathroom upstairs.
Downstairs there is a looks like

2c90ab1b-9db9-4309-95ea-4350e3713a31-1
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:38.020
it. I would assume it's a child
and they are like drawing a red.

c5242912-e1ab-4326-bd48-8a8672175d09-0
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.678
Semicircle on the wall and it
almost looks like it's kind of

c5242912-e1ab-4326-bd48-8a8672175d09-1
00:09:42.678 --> 00:09:45.752
like the door that's upstairs.
So there's a little door

c5242912-e1ab-4326-bd48-8a8672175d09-2
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:49.046
upstairs that that a person
cannot fit through. And the the

c5242912-e1ab-4326-bd48-8a8672175d09-3
00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:52.450
child downstairs is wearing a
crown and they are drawing like

c5242912-e1ab-4326-bd48-8a8672175d09-4
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.360
a bigger sized version of that
door. So it's like a.

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-0
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.364
A semi circle. And the picture
is, it's not black and white,

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-1
00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:05.352
but it's like a there's not a
lot of color in it except

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-2
00:10:05.352 --> 00:10:09.697
certain things. So, so the man
is in color, the kite is red,

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-3
00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:13.828
the kite is in color, and then
downstairs the child is in

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-4
00:10:13.828 --> 00:10:18.243
color. The marker that they're
using to draw is in color. And

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-5
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:22.445
then there's a couple other
things in the bedroom that are

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-6
00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:26.790
like hanging from the ceiling.
It looks like that might be a

6801350c-f62d-4a89-ada0-cc69eb78c5f2-7
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.930
hot air balloon.

24e46a48-064c-4170-9e1e-6edecaf2a8eb-0
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.460
And then, I don't know, maybe a
plane or something that's

24e46a48-064c-4170-9e1e-6edecaf2a8eb-1
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.500
hanging from the ceiling and
then it shows even below the

24e46a48-064c-4170-9e1e-6edecaf2a8eb-2
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.590
house like it shows the pipes.

c6c77676-f933-4124-b450-b0036ae2833d-0
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:43.677
And the brick from below the
house, and then it even shows

c6c77676-f933-4124-b450-b0036ae2833d-1
00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:48.159
like the steps leading outside
and the tree outside. And it

c6c77676-f933-4124-b450-b0036ae2833d-2
00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:52.716
looks like they must live in
some sort of a big city because

c6c77676-f933-4124-b450-b0036ae2833d-3
00:10:52.716 --> 00:10:56.675
there are very big buildings
outside, like high-rise

c6c77676-f933-4124-b450-b0036ae2833d-4
00:10:56.675 --> 00:10:58.019
buildings outside.

fb0d555e-c6e7-4e90-ae00-c7aaa5b27b79-0
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.450
{And we can move on to the next
page.

5cbd2daa-11a8-4c6f-a892-529a2becaacd-0
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.750
OK.}

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-0
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.384
So and then next page, it looks
like the man sees the kite. So

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-1
00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:16.356
the man is working at his desk,
he sees the kite, he looks down

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-2
00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:21.406
at it on the ground, and then he
goes to pick it up. And then he

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-3
00:11:21.406 --> 00:11:25.990
drops the kite, and now he's
down in the child's room. And

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-4
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.807
the red drawing that the child
is making on the wall is now a

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-5
00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:35.779
door. And it's a red door, and
it's open and the man is peeking

1b3a86f6-bdc6-4a09-ab22-9b93b3e80630-6
00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.099
through the door.

c5ae6e11-cec5-4da5-822d-9213c144681d-0
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.387
And, um, it looks like he's
trying to figure out what's

c5ae6e11-cec5-4da5-822d-9213c144681d-1
00:11:41.387 --> 00:11:45.544
going on and if his child went
through the door or what

c5ae6e11-cec5-4da5-822d-9213c144681d-2
00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:50.146
happened. The man, let's see,
the man's wearing a blue shirt.

c5ae6e11-cec5-4da5-822d-9213c144681d-3
00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:51.260
He has a beard.

a5e82e9c-912e-4f18-82ad-d340f2c8e3c3-0
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.980
And.

53a67e0a-5f1b-45ec-9e92-15f3a91dd77b-0
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.433
Um, the kite is red. The door is
also red. I don't know if that's

53a67e0a-5f1b-45ec-9e92-15f3a91dd77b-1
00:11:59.433 --> 00:12:01.100
any significance there.

d98b9068-5c7c-4240-9ea0-e190d3260bc4-0
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.820
Um.

990c60f4-fef6-463c-b040-cd052eae8ba8-0
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.020
{And.

789a1161-b81c-4680-b535-da9d7f0e0586-0
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.480
Yeah, that's it. We can move on
to the next page.

be276cbe-2605-4841-9ca5-f9b41ceee001-0
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.898
So I don't know if this matters,
but the the page on the the left

be276cbe-2605-4841-9ca5-f9b41ceee001-1
00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:20.590
side is cut off a little bit.

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-0
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.530
There we go. OK. Thank you.} So
the man goes through the door,

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-1
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.132
and the door leads him through a
tree. It's almost like they're

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-2
00:12:33.132 --> 00:12:37.663
living in the tree because the
door is shown. He's now outside

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-3
00:12:37.663 --> 00:12:42.121
of the tree, and it looks like
he went through that red door.

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-4
00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:46.724
The door is part of the tree. So
now we're outside. He is among

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-5
00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:51.326
the trees. {Thank you. Yeah, I
can see everything now.} There's

845211bc-b8f3-46c2-8777-cf4c166a07b8-6
00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:54.850
lights. There's like lanterns
and string lights.

982a1ab0-b3ba-4d0c-9be1-80cfbb9b5712-0
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.180
Hanging from the trees.

7992e606-e901-4943-9cc4-874435be9c26-0
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.924
Um, almost like like a magical
forest or something, because

7992e606-e901-4943-9cc4-874435be9c26-1
00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:07.336
there's very big trees
surrounding him. He just came

7992e606-e901-4943-9cc4-874435be9c26-2
00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:12.331
out of the tree and there's a a
river or some sort of water

7992e606-e901-4943-9cc4-874435be9c26-3
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:13.830
there. There is a.

785376a7-e22d-4506-b9ec-1e962dcbbf62-0
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.081
A deck or a trying to think of
the other word that I could use

785376a7-e22d-4506-b9ec-1e962dcbbf62-1
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:23.041
for a deck. There's like a pier
that has some sort of red

785376a7-e22d-4506-b9ec-1e962dcbbf62-2
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:27.548
something on it. I can't tell if
it's like a balloon or a ball or

785376a7-e22d-4506-b9ec-1e962dcbbf62-3
00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:31.918
probably not a balloon because
it's not floating so like a ball

785376a7-e22d-4506-b9ec-1e962dcbbf62-4
00:13:31.918 --> 00:13:34.240
or some sort of red circle on
it.

3b13cd61-4299-4850-a11f-181ce2cdf73b-0
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:40.077
And then the the lights are
really pretty. It looks like the

3b13cd61-4299-4850-a11f-181ce2cdf73b-1
00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:45.184
trees are losing some of their
leaves. There's some like leaves

3b13cd61-4299-4850-a11f-181ce2cdf73b-2
00:13:45.184 --> 00:13:49.972
or something falling from the
trees, and the man is outside

3b13cd61-4299-4850-a11f-181ce2cdf73b-3
00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:51.010
just kind of.

3e36b134-ab9f-4868-814c-01adba8e544a-0
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.832
Looking to see, you know, to see
where he is now, because now

3e36b134-ab9f-4868-814c-01adba8e544a-1
00:13:55.832 --> 00:13:59.945
he's outside and his kid just
like drew this door and now the

3e36b134-ab9f-4868-814c-01adba8e544a-2
00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:03.991
man is is going through the
door. {I can move on to the next

3e36b134-ab9f-4868-814c-01adba8e544a-3
00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:04.390
page.}

2a5b39f9-9307-415d-974c-cb872a6e4ed6-0
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.035
So it yeah, looks like it is a
ball. So the man makes it to the

2a5b39f9-9307-415d-974c-cb872a6e4ed6-1
00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:15.165
pier. He's now holding the ball
and on this Little River or

2a5b39f9-9307-415d-974c-cb872a6e4ed6-2
00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:19.364
stream or Creek, whatever it is,
it's some sort of a body of

2a5b39f9-9307-415d-974c-cb872a6e4ed6-3
00:14:19.364 --> 00:14:22.599
water that is surrounding him.
There is a big.

7d36b976-ace0-4b35-a1e7-3b12e1dbe6d3-0
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.306
Looks like a boat, but it's in
the shape of a dragon that is

7d36b976-ace0-4b35-a1e7-3b12e1dbe6d3-1
00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:32.458
coming around towards him. So
he's holding the ball, he's

7d36b976-ace0-4b35-a1e7-3b12e1dbe6d3-2
00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:36.395
standing on the pier, he's
looking at this dragon boat

7d36b976-ace0-4b35-a1e7-3b12e1dbe6d3-3
00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:39.329
coming towards him and on the
next page.

f8ba4ebb-d973-4dbd-9edd-6cc30d4d087a-0
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:44.138
It looks like the boat is there.
The boat comes up to the pier

f8ba4ebb-d973-4dbd-9edd-6cc30d4d087a-1
00:14:44.138 --> 00:14:48.181
and he steps on the boat with
the ball. So he's got the ball,

f8ba4ebb-d973-4dbd-9edd-6cc30d4d087a-2
00:14:48.181 --> 00:14:52.160
he's on the boat and now the
boat is moving forward and they

f8ba4ebb-d973-4dbd-9edd-6cc30d4d087a-3
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.268
are moving away from the pier
{and you can move on to the next

f8ba4ebb-d973-4dbd-9edd-6cc30d4d087a-4
00:14:56.268 --> 00:14:56.659
page}.

1eaf9e1e-f5fe-44bd-866c-8e7b9b465bac-0
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.242
Now it looks like he's at a
magical castle. So he is kind of

1eaf9e1e-f5fe-44bd-866c-8e7b9b465bac-1
00:15:05.242 --> 00:15:10.334
like peering. He's got his hand
at his head. He's peering to

1eaf9e1e-f5fe-44bd-866c-8e7b9b465bac-2
00:15:10.334 --> 00:15:15.175
this big giant castle. He's
still on this boat that looks

1eaf9e1e-f5fe-44bd-866c-8e7b9b465bac-3
00:15:15.175 --> 00:15:19.850
kind of like a dragon or
whatever it happens to be. And

1eaf9e1e-f5fe-44bd-866c-8e7b9b465bac-4
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:25.192
and he's looking at this giant,
giant, giant castle and there's

1eaf9e1e-f5fe-44bd-866c-8e7b9b465bac-5
00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:29.450
a bridge from the castle. The
Moon is a full moon.

89fad751-4ad8-4f05-8ae5-f15196c3a788-0
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.170
The sky is just some beautiful
colors. It is blue and purple.

89fad751-4ad8-4f05-8ae5-f15196c3a788-1
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.468
There's some pink in it. They
are headed down the stream or

89fad751-4ad8-4f05-8ae5-f15196c3a788-2
00:15:38.468 --> 00:15:42.693
whatever the body of water is
and they are, they are right

89fad751-4ad8-4f05-8ae5-f15196c3a788-3
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:46.847
there at the the castle and
there's, I mean gosh, there's

89fad751-4ad8-4f05-8ae5-f15196c3a788-4
00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:51.145
like layers upon layers of this
castle. It looks like it is

89fad751-4ad8-4f05-8ae5-f15196c3a788-5
00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:51.790
probably.

c14eb5d4-412f-4c10-aeff-311578fd0082-0
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:59.085
Four or five stories high, with
all kinds of different little

c14eb5d4-412f-4c10-aeff-311578fd0082-1
00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:03.220
buildings around and all kinds
of peaks and.

d69691f3-9d91-49ca-a115-65aa67c24a65-0
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:11.109
Like rooftops that are separate,
but it's all together. There's

d69691f3-9d91-49ca-a115-65aa67c24a65-1
00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:15.238
the big bridge. There's
something on top of the bridge.

d69691f3-9d91-49ca-a115-65aa67c24a65-2
00:16:15.238 --> 00:16:20.105
I can't tell exactly what it is.
It looks like maybe it's a child

d69691f3-9d91-49ca-a115-65aa67c24a65-3
00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.760
in a little boat, but I can't
tell.

bd0b805d-628a-4fbd-b4f5-0ff2d741402d-0
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.313
And on the other side of the
bridge, it looks like there's

bd0b805d-628a-4fbd-b4f5-0ff2d741402d-1
00:16:28.313 --> 00:16:29.600
like a tiny little.

3dff4238-6994-42f0-88d3-8c01aaa4c3f2-0
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.506
I don't know, maybe a castle or
some kind of something with with

3dff4238-6994-42f0-88d3-8c01aaa4c3f2-1
00:16:35.506 --> 00:16:38.490
roofs. That's an outdoor that's
outdoors.

edf71b89-130c-4f99-9e71-379e638eb1cf-0
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.710


88a7eb82-3069-492f-9cf4-c027808600e3-0
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.104
Yeah, and there's flags. There's
a lot of the roofs have flags

88a7eb82-3069-492f-9cf4-c027808600e3-1
00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:50.100
that are flying on the top of
the castle.

463489e2-390d-425e-b411-1cc56eb754a9-0
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.940
Umm.

6fa5c590-a9cc-4ec2-b158-9f28d9e5dc6b-0
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.630
{Yeah. And we can move on to the
next page.}

85a7c585-ef04-45fb-bb37-e1bc924a6c10-0
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:07.186
So he is stepping off the boat
and now he's coming on to where

85a7c585-ef04-45fb-bb37-e1bc924a6c10-1
00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:08.770
the castle is.

35c57320-1b3f-4f37-afe7-6030064d5a2b-0
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.124
He dropped the ball. The red
ball is like he just kind of

35c57320-1b3f-4f37-afe7-6030064d5a2b-1
00:17:14.124 --> 00:17:17.924
threw it as he dropped as he
came off the boat and it looks

35c57320-1b3f-4f37-afe7-6030064d5a2b-2
00:17:17.924 --> 00:17:21.598
like, I'm guessing that is that
one of those is his child

35c57320-1b3f-4f37-afe7-6030064d5a2b-3
00:17:21.598 --> 00:17:25.209
because they're there's two
children and they're wearing

35c57320-1b3f-4f37-afe7-6030064d5a2b-4
00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:26.920
crowns and then there is a.

52afc053-8065-4671-9388-a92c246a8443-0
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:33.025
It looks like a king. It's a man
with a very long white beard and

52afc053-8065-4671-9388-a92c246a8443-1
00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:38.160
he's wearing a crown as well and
he's wearing like some special

52afc053-8065-4671-9388-a92c246a8443-2
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.134
clothing that that looks like it
could be clothing of a king.

52afc053-8065-4671-9388-a92c246a8443-3
00:17:43.134 --> 00:17:48.029
There is a a bird like a hawk.
He's sort of a big bird there

52afc053-8065-4671-9388-a92c246a8443-4
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:51.800
too. There's some guards that
are on the side.

eec7601d-4374-4556-8b54-88c380402eb7-0
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.891
On the other side, it looks like
there's some people as well, and

eec7601d-4374-4556-8b54-88c380402eb7-1
00:17:58.891 --> 00:17:59.710
let's see.

903c8998-f2df-47db-ad20-3c2a2b3e8f75-0
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.197
So he is. So the man is like
running off the boat to get to

903c8998-f2df-47db-ad20-3c2a2b3e8f75-1
00:18:06.197 --> 00:18:11.484
the people in the castle, and
then on the next page there's a

903c8998-f2df-47db-ad20-3c2a2b3e8f75-2
00:18:11.484 --> 00:18:16.601
chair which looks like it's
probably like a King's chair or

903c8998-f2df-47db-ad20-3c2a2b3e8f75-3
00:18:16.601 --> 00:18:20.610
some sort of a special chair.
The man is with.

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-0
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.030
I would call him the king.
Whoever the you know the man

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-1
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:29.146
with the white beard is, let's
just call him the king unless we

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-2
00:18:29.146 --> 00:18:32.746
find out otherwise. And then
he's also with the the two

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-3
00:18:32.746 --> 00:18:36.669
children. One of the children
looks a little like annoyed or

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-4
00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:40.462
peeved or something. He's
crossing his arms and looking at

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-5
00:18:40.462 --> 00:18:44.578
the chair and the other child is
standing with the king and the

4b6e8c68-b484-47a5-a403-29b3d23df229-6
00:18:44.578 --> 00:18:47.150
man is is just approaching all
of them.

a039727e-3fa9-4c35-95ee-a62bb0ad19ec-0
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.830
{And you can move on to the next
page.}

fd03ed96-0aff-4070-b0c7-29b2dccc70aa-0
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.030
And now they're inside the
castle.

32f16d29-0f3b-4192-a568-63eee9d7a6bf-0
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.500
They are overlooking the water.

e20ac250-126c-4acd-a56e-e8b592078243-0
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.430
That bird.

2d818b50-0af1-4835-b0c5-78bdf479aefc-0
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.937
Is still with them. It's like a
hawk, but it's got a really long

2d818b50-0af1-4835-b0c5-78bdf479aefc-1
00:19:07.937 --> 00:19:11.877
tail. So it's it's not exactly a
hawk, but it's it's it's a

2d818b50-0af1-4835-b0c5-78bdf479aefc-2
00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:15.160
purple bird with some sort of a
really long tail.

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-0
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.931
Yep. The one looks like it must
be his child because he's got

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-1
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:26.707
the crown and he's holding a red
marker and then there's another

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-2
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:30.425
child there and he's holding a
purple marker and he's wearing a

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-3
00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:34.027
crown as well. So the man, the
king, the two children are all

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-4
00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:37.396
together. And there is some
other people that are coming,

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-5
00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:41.172
coming to the place as well. And
I'm thinking from what it looks

f90f24d3-8333-43b6-bbc2-d5fe2d9f8e46-6
00:19:41.172 --> 00:19:43.380
like that they don't want them
there.

85b0239f-f43e-4255-9bf7-858be05d0337-0
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.800
That boat is still there.

fa04b51f-689c-4f1c-a504-fec5824ade8b-0
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.850
The people are coming off.

6431e280-4f84-4e9d-9460-78742af1ca59-0
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.748
Of the boat that looks really
similar to what the man came off

6431e280-4f84-4e9d-9460-78742af1ca59-1
00:19:55.748 --> 00:19:59.237
of, and they're like inside the
boat. So the man was just kind

6431e280-4f84-4e9d-9460-78742af1ca59-2
00:19:59.237 --> 00:20:02.394
of like on the boat. These
people are inside the boat. I

6431e280-4f84-4e9d-9460-78742af1ca59-3
00:20:02.394 --> 00:20:05.993
don't know if it's the same boat
or not, but they are coming to,

6431e280-4f84-4e9d-9460-78742af1ca59-4
00:20:05.993 --> 00:20:09.150
they're coming up to the castle
and the king is holding.

a7d09dd4-f300-4ee9-99c7-4612d01c4558-0
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.600
Some sort of a light or a wand
or something and.

11397f37-2ab8-471a-97c7-a84e6b0c2006-0
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.988
Ah, there's the sky in the
background with stars, the

11397f37-2ab8-471a-97c7-a84e6b0c2006-1
00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:21.160
really pretty colors, and the
water.

b2fd50dd-e174-4912-b783-11f4b321fadf-0
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.110
Umm.

352f2fcc-cac6-48f5-ad5c-0c4e9c397640-0
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.370
And that the man and the
children are there as well.

88bd3354-d732-4055-8312-2c7351c1f7bd-0
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.816
They're like standing on the top
of the stairs as these people

88bd3354-d732-4055-8312-2c7351c1f7bd-1
00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:33.320
come up {and we can move on to
the next page}.

ec77d360-8de5-49d8-a0da-30290446626d-0
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.370
And OK, it looks like the king
is holding a sword.

42315668-772c-4bae-a833-ccbd2aad1977-0
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.701
So the king is now in front of
the two children and the man,

42315668-772c-4bae-a833-ccbd2aad1977-1
00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:49.189
the people are approaching the
king. They've got some sort of

42315668-772c-4bae-a833-ccbd2aad1977-2
00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:52.452
like a box that, I don't know,
it's like a kind of like a

42315668-772c-4bae-a833-ccbd2aad1977-3
00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:55.997
jack-in-the-box where you would
like turn something on it, but

42315668-772c-4bae-a833-ccbd2aad1977-4
00:20:55.997 --> 00:20:59.259
it's not a jack-in-the-box. So I
don't know what that is.

5ab4d1d8-cd10-48b3-b5c0-3e274856f236-0
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.690
And.

54c5bede-e650-45f6-8680-60c817c5c447-0
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.950
The people look like, they're
dressed like.

d96a9640-1154-4422-a819-ccdfaed5576c-0
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.960
Guards, maybe?

f333f279-663e-43bd-946f-260a18f2256c-0
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.030
They're wearing hats.

28241b47-1757-4137-a631-4967cc544b10-0
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.120
Or maybe they're wearing like.

7cd70c02-ebab-4ac8-888f-50a806545c27-0
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.966
Like metal armor suits. They
might be wearing like some sort

7cd70c02-ebab-4ac8-888f-50a806545c27-1
00:21:21.966 --> 00:21:25.980
of metal armor suits. So the
king is there, he's got his

7cd70c02-ebab-4ac8-888f-50a806545c27-2
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.853
sword almost like stay back to
the the people that are

7cd70c02-ebab-4ac8-888f-50a806545c27-3
00:21:29.853 --> 00:21:33.938
approaching. And then on the
next page, one of the people

7cd70c02-ebab-4ac8-888f-50a806545c27-4
00:21:33.938 --> 00:21:35.840
tries to approach and then.

6074c418-1a20-414e-8c1d-085da5f7376b-0
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.974
King puts his sword out towards
him. The person is coming up the

6074c418-1a20-414e-8c1d-085da5f7376b-1
00:21:40.974 --> 00:21:45.193
stairs at him. He's got his
sword out towards him. That guy,

6074c418-1a20-414e-8c1d-085da5f7376b-2
00:21:45.193 --> 00:21:48.720
that person has the
jack-in-the-box thing, and he.

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-0
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:54.186
He puts it towards the king and
the king loses his sword and

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-1
00:21:54.186 --> 00:21:58.252
maybe it's like a magic box. The
other two men have Spears and

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-2
00:21:58.252 --> 00:22:02.318
they take the king. Looks like
they're about to take the king.

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-3
00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:05.738
And this man who had the
jack-in-the-box thing, he's

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-4
00:22:05.738 --> 00:22:09.739
running towards the castle, so
he ran past the king. The king

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-5
00:22:09.739 --> 00:22:13.547
has reaching his arm out like,
no, don't go there. And the

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-6
00:22:13.547 --> 00:22:17.548
other two men with the Spears
have the king. {You can move on

6558774f-33cd-4323-8284-4db81a48b854-7
00:22:17.548 --> 00:22:18.710
to the next page.}

147ecb1e-5f4d-46a0-b387-e68daee91d07-0
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.447
So now we're at a page with the
so the the man who had gotten

147ecb1e-5f4d-46a0-b387-e68daee91d07-1
00:22:25.447 --> 00:22:27.590
past them with the jack with
the.

ae988448-c3cc-4247-97cf-619214a03b6d-0
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.724
Umm, the jack-in-the-box, or
whatever The thing is called, is

ae988448-c3cc-4247-97cf-619214a03b6d-1
00:22:33.724 --> 00:22:39.253
coming towards the man with the
children, the one child with the

ae988448-c3cc-4247-97cf-619214a03b6d-2
00:22:39.253 --> 00:22:41.040
crown and the purple.

37cf067b-c0d0-414f-a9a6-a98215370fe8-0
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.751
The purple marker is drawing.
He's drawing like a wing with

37cf067b-c0d0-414f-a9a6-a98215370fe8-1
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:50.830
his purple marker. And now on
the next page, the man.

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-0
00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.340
And the two children are flying
off on the Purple Dragon. So the

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-1
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.308
wing turned into a purple
dragon. So it's like they're

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-2
00:23:00.308 --> 00:23:04.637
they're drawing what they want
and then it's it's coming to

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-3
00:23:04.637 --> 00:23:09.039
life and so they're flying away
on the purple dragon and the

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-4
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:13.657
let's just call them the bad man
because I don't know what they

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-5
00:23:13.657 --> 00:23:18.202
are but they it looks like they
stole the king. So the bad man

b4351e98-a793-4c39-b451-4be74e7efe3f-6
00:23:18.202 --> 00:23:22.460
with the the jack-in-the-box is
reaching out towards them.

a1fe505f-8b47-46be-86d6-4f1c2e6d5051-0
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.450
He's still on the.

d3550ab1-9bf4-42d7-87d9-d856b5add1e7-0
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.059
On the um, the deck of the
castle. He's reaching out to

d3550ab1-9bf4-42d7-87d9-d856b5add1e7-1
00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:35.874
them. They are flying over the
water in front of the moon on

d3550ab1-9bf4-42d7-87d9-d856b5add1e7-2
00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:36.900
their dragon.

c50f2b69-36c0-423f-8f55-d6bafe84e7f6-0
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.060
{We can move on to the next
page.}

936b8e41-3663-45c6-8a84-4b4f44753e2c-0
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.359
OK, now we're on a page where
they're all on the dragon. The

936b8e41-3663-45c6-8a84-4b4f44753e2c-1
00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:53.142
purple dragon. We can see the
castle below. We can see there's

936b8e41-3663-45c6-8a84-4b4f44753e2c-2
00:23:53.142 --> 00:23:58.833
like a waterfall below, there's
water below. We could see the

936b8e41-3663-45c6-8a84-4b4f44753e2c-3
00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:03.240
the boat that the original man
came in on, and.

5a4493f9-88a8-4ec1-a29a-8b605d1f6b05-0
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.510
The one child is just kind of
reaching off.

e3328864-542b-4ccf-a4de-46519fc13f99-0
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.356
But they're all flying on the
dragon. {Move on to the next

e3328864-542b-4ccf-a4de-46519fc13f99-1
00:24:13.356 --> 00:24:13.740
page.}

1da99533-1e29-4d86-b943-ebc0e33ca20e-0
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.680
And OK, so the child with the
red.

284dc062-e788-4b5b-b436-42d69762f5c2-0
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.463
Marker and the man are holding
hands and they have fallen off

284dc062-e788-4b5b-b436-42d69762f5c2-1
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:27.778
the dragon. It looks like
something happened to the

284dc062-e788-4b5b-b436-42d69762f5c2-2
00:24:27.778 --> 00:24:28.480
Dragon, so.

5b7c4a29-3bc8-4a58-9040-4925861e32a5-0
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.610
Looks like that.

cbb43b45-2f11-4711-8b54-ca05d69a7862-0
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.064
Boat is now in the air and
there's like purple dragon

cbb43b45-2f11-4711-8b54-ca05d69a7862-1
00:24:38.064 --> 00:24:39.700
feathers everywhere.

c8097588-598a-4df8-b4b0-2880d10ad278-0
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.070
The other child is hanging on on
the boat.

f5feea0f-5b97-4f91-a84f-1a5de11d5373-0
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.006
And there are four people on the
boat. Looks like they must have.

f5feea0f-5b97-4f91-a84f-1a5de11d5373-1
00:24:51.006 --> 00:24:53.810
Maybe they killed the dragon
with the boat?

1b7bf4b0-d7c7-481a-b61b-90b0be33fa9b-0
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.816
They're all in the sky, so two
of them are falling. There's

1b7bf4b0-d7c7-481a-b61b-90b0be33fa9b-1
00:25:00.816 --> 00:25:04.127
four people on the boat and the
one child is like somebody's

1b7bf4b0-d7c7-481a-b61b-90b0be33fa9b-2
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:07.492
like reaching out to him from
the boat and he's holding on on

1b7bf4b0-d7c7-481a-b61b-90b0be33fa9b-3
00:25:07.492 --> 00:25:08.469
that person's arm.

89631a46-4a10-41ad-926e-c190d40327e7-0
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.380
{Make you go to the next page.}

0dab363c-013d-418c-b338-4d378e61ad47-0
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.970
OK, now we're underwater.

5feb975c-e4e5-4a26-ab01-d6f7010c4b24-0
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:21.858
There's a lot going on in this
story. So now we're underwater,

5feb975c-e4e5-4a26-ab01-d6f7010c4b24-1
00:25:21.858 --> 00:25:25.521
we can see there's fish or
something with them. It's the

5feb975c-e4e5-4a26-ab01-d6f7010c4b24-2
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:29.506
man who had fallen off the boat
along with the child with the

5feb975c-e4e5-4a26-ab01-d6f7010c4b24-3
00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:31.370
red crayon or the red marker.

06987d3c-59db-48a0-971a-b34b23c52594-0
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.440
They've splashed down into the
water.

38d84497-0029-41f8-97e0-22c213430ad1-0
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.870
Some like purple hook or
something with them and then.

1ad1b860-7425-4466-8fe3-0cc845feafc5-0
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.953
And the next page, the child
with the red marker is drawing

1ad1b860-7425-4466-8fe3-0cc845feafc5-1
00:25:48.953 --> 00:25:51.120
something with his red marker.

51916732-07c0-43e9-9414-fb5714e3587f-0
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.380
{OK, we can move on.}

6fcc140c-e777-4ec6-b57c-a46adb897414-0
00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.505
OK, it looks like he was must
have been drawing a submarine,

6fcc140c-e777-4ec6-b57c-a46adb897414-1
00:26:01.505 --> 00:26:04.920
because now there there is a
submarine. They are.

f3781993-fb0d-4704-a806-2157cfe01a0e-0
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.110
Still underwater.

105b28c9-e450-45de-870a-75a13da9b3d4-0
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.208
They're on the submarine, but
they're like on the outside of

105b28c9-e450-45de-870a-75a13da9b3d4-1
00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:11.370
it.

f39d2bd4-4e9c-4dd9-9dcc-1d3eefe2bc30-0
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.567
Yeah, I'm going to turn it into
a real submarine. {Move on to

f39d2bd4-4e9c-4dd9-9dcc-1d3eefe2bc30-1
00:26:22.567 --> 00:26:23.370
the next page.}

3e6c8b92-87bc-4239-bba5-af1181ee7e77-0
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.440
Now they are on top of the water
on the submarine. They're

3e6c8b92-87bc-4239-bba5-af1181ee7e77-1
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.623
standing on top of the
submarine. I'm not sure what

3e6c8b92-87bc-4239-bba5-af1181ee7e77-2
00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:35.234
this purple thing is. It looks
like it was part of the the

3e6c8b92-87bc-4239-bba5-af1181ee7e77-3
00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:38.783
Purple Dragon, but it's still
with them. And then there's

3e6c8b92-87bc-4239-bba5-af1181ee7e77-4
00:26:38.783 --> 00:26:39.090
like.

16e3cc05-31cb-4389-89c4-7bca9996325e-0
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.250
They're in like a cave.

91c0e26a-6b1b-4133-8a1b-aed121cb460e-0
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.291
They're still water there,
they're in a cave and then

91c0e26a-6b1b-4133-8a1b-aed121cb460e-1
00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:45.930
there's like.

95f38221-98b4-4c5b-9340-85a3d04c1122-0
00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.660
Faded pictures of people around
them.

ce598be8-8f58-4164-bb5f-dcf1c82652a0-0
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.292
I can't tell if they're like
drawings of people in The Cave

ce598be8-8f58-4164-bb5f-dcf1c82652a0-1
00:26:56.292 --> 00:26:58.700
or if they're like the ghosts of
people.

1d438c53-3f7b-4e3b-9247-6dbb8a89b889-0
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.572
But they're not. It doesn't look
like they're actual people and

1d438c53-3f7b-4e3b-9247-6dbb8a89b889-1
00:27:05.572 --> 00:27:08.200
the the man and the child are
looking up at them.

d4d7297e-0ae3-4fe8-9578-e32a218531b7-0
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.400
{OK, move on to the next.}

46f61e1e-2502-42c6-a597-fd828394868c-0
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.521
Yeah, it looks like they must be
drawings. So now they're inside

46f61e1e-2502-42c6-a597-fd828394868c-1
00:27:19.521 --> 00:27:22.604
The Cave, they've stepped off of
the submarine. They still have

46f61e1e-2502-42c6-a597-fd828394868c-2
00:27:22.604 --> 00:27:24.580
whatever that purple thing is
with them.

6a2024a1-6f8c-42da-85dd-0a9198bb191f-0
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.486
They're pointing at the drawings
in The Cave and there's a

6a2024a1-6f8c-42da-85dd-0a9198bb191f-1
00:27:30.486 --> 00:27:31.260
drawing of.

271cebd3-7556-48ea-9f1d-9229a295b3dd-0
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.680
Um, let's see if two people
one's got like a star. The other

271cebd3-7556-48ea-9f1d-9229a295b3dd-1
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.360
one is like pouring something
out.

5aaf8bfa-4cea-467b-908d-24ba89b67228-0
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.129
Yeah, the submarine's not on
this page anymore, so they're

5aaf8bfa-4cea-467b-908d-24ba89b67228-1
00:27:48.129 --> 00:27:49.340
not on the submarine.

4989c3c7-8f38-4b47-950d-8080c4f270a0-0
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.172
And there's like a little like
house inside The Cave with a

4989c3c7-8f38-4b47-950d-8080c4f270a0-1
00:27:55.172 --> 00:27:55.490
door.

a910445c-a885-4e79-b74b-b05069a36dde-0
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.440
{OK, we can move on.}

abaead30-4183-41c2-a85f-584949ac438f-0
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.800
And.

351cbfe7-f3a9-4405-b9b8-b4abf5584957-0
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.508
So they are still in The Cave.
Now there's oh, now there's

351cbfe7-f3a9-4405-b9b8-b4abf5584957-1
00:28:13.508 --> 00:28:17.482
people there. So now the the
people on the Dragon boat have

351cbfe7-f3a9-4405-b9b8-b4abf5584957-2
00:28:17.482 --> 00:28:21.590
followed them to The Cave. They
are standing just outside The

351cbfe7-f3a9-4405-b9b8-b4abf5584957-3
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.630
Cave, and the man and the child
are hiding in The Cave along

351cbfe7-f3a9-4405-b9b8-b4abf5584957-4
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.870
with their purple whatever it is
that they got from the dragon.

351cbfe7-f3a9-4405-b9b8-b4abf5584957-5
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:34.110
On the next page, there's they
still got that purple thing and.

a75bd026-6c9d-4b3b-a6c7-ab1e4dedba23-0
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.534
The man is now drawing with, it
looks like a black marker. He's

a75bd026-6c9d-4b3b-a6c7-ab1e4dedba23-1
00:28:39.534 --> 00:28:40.060
drawing

e96a63fe-4959-41e4-9286-b3a555895b09-0
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.493
a rectangle. It might be a door,
I'm not sure. And then with the

e96a63fe-4959-41e4-9286-b3a555895b09-1
00:28:45.493 --> 00:28:48.460
purple thing, it's like hanging
from the door.

65e829c9-f2ea-4ca0-8d78-7df739be8d7e-0
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.050
Almost like a like a bird cage.
And they've got it.

7c903de3-24f3-421e-98ed-ec2b443bd7a9-0
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.090
Got it.

61ea685c-88d3-43e6-914a-c507e5fd5948-0
00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.077
As part of that. But that was
just something that the man

61ea685c-88d3-43e6-914a-c507e5fd5948-1
00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:00.320
drew.

7a30cae9-4a9f-4bb9-953f-326a7f4e1c07-0
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.230
And the child is watching him.

90b44776-7fda-4a7b-a344-93583a9720d6-0
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.540
{All right, let's go on to the
next one.}

a63bc6a4-80f6-47f7-9601-a3be01f7e4c1-0
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.560
OK, so.

98918eb8-74dd-4149-9c4f-c9b8eb7b2730-0
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.992
The child, the child and the man
hid, they're hiding, they're

98918eb8-74dd-4149-9c4f-c9b8eb7b2730-1
00:29:22.992 --> 00:29:28.495
peeking. They're watching the
bad man come off of the dragon

98918eb8-74dd-4149-9c4f-c9b8eb7b2730-2
00:29:28.495 --> 00:29:34.449
boat and he's got his, his magic
jack-in-the-box and he's pulling

98918eb8-74dd-4149-9c4f-c9b8eb7b2730-3
00:29:34.449 --> 00:29:34.810
the.

702eed7a-1337-49fa-9b71-6444b873f826-0
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.710
The purple purple thing.

d994d1fa-bca6-4193-9c09-a8f045e7ce73-0
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:43.651
And he is getting trapped. So
they have created a trap for

d994d1fa-bca6-4193-9c09-a8f045e7ce73-1
00:29:43.651 --> 00:29:49.011
him. So he is now inside of this
almost like it's like a little

d994d1fa-bca6-4193-9c09-a8f045e7ce73-2
00:29:49.011 --> 00:29:54.120
jail and he is trapped inside
and they have stolen his magic

d994d1fa-bca6-4193-9c09-a8f045e7ce73-3
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.460
jack-in-the-box.

b8d3dc74-56c7-44bf-9df6-e2c67232586c-0
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.692
{You can move on to the next.}
Sorry, the man and the child

b8d3dc74-56c7-44bf-9df6-e2c67232586c-1
00:29:59.692 --> 00:30:00.420
have done that.

3d79fd97-99f6-4f57-bfa2-cef416c95d46-0
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.082
OK and now this page is super
colorful, so it looks like the

3d79fd97-99f6-4f57-bfa2-cef416c95d46-1
00:30:05.082 --> 00:30:06.690
Jack-in-the-box has like.

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-0
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.688
Exploded. Maybe they've
destroyed it, like they've like

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-1
00:30:11.688 --> 00:30:15.827
thrown it, and there's just all
these beautiful colors coming

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-2
00:30:15.827 --> 00:30:20.032
out of it. There's the purple
Dragon, there's that purple bird

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-3
00:30:20.032 --> 00:30:23.971
from before. We've got some
other beautiful bright colors,

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-4
00:30:23.971 --> 00:30:27.509
some Blues and greens and
yellows and Reds. Ohh. And

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-5
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:31.714
there's the king and the other
child. They're like part of the

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-6
00:30:31.714 --> 00:30:35.719
colors too. They're in there.
And there's some other things

241179a1-6493-4fea-ad5a-7700afec0796-7
00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:38.390
like butterflies and maybe
dragonflies.

64c174a6-59ee-443a-b1a6-c481f8bb6efd-0
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.420
Things like that.

4bee8bb1-3a8b-46f1-b542-1eca9c8c4919-0
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.229
The other two bad men that are
on the boat are watching this

4bee8bb1-3a8b-46f1-b542-1eca9c8c4919-1
00:30:45.229 --> 00:30:49.742
from the Dragon boat and they're
just kind of like holding up

4bee8bb1-3a8b-46f1-b542-1eca9c8c4919-2
00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:54.182
their arms as though like to
stay away. The person the other

4bee8bb1-3a8b-46f1-b542-1eca9c8c4919-3
00:30:54.182 --> 00:30:58.039
bad man is still captured inside
of the little jail.

d5239807-cd49-4f41-afb1-dbc3fe27a56f-0
00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.780
{Again, move on to the next
page.}

2a581af7-efd2-4978-9c2f-f87c5cdb9450-0
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:08.365
And everything is. Looks like
they saved everything. So the

2a581af7-efd2-4978-9c2f-f87c5cdb9450-1
00:31:08.365 --> 00:31:13.580
birds and the purple dragon,
they're all flying away. The

2a581af7-efd2-4978-9c2f-f87c5cdb9450-2
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.749
King is safe.

e3c31c8f-90bb-4206-b70f-20ac11681eb0-0
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.988
So the other child maybe is the
is the King's child. He's safe.

e3c31c8f-90bb-4206-b70f-20ac11681eb0-1
00:31:19.988 --> 00:31:23.864
He's with the king as well, and
then the man and the child are

e3c31c8f-90bb-4206-b70f-20ac11681eb0-2
00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:27.495
together. So they're all just
kind of like watching all of

e3c31c8f-90bb-4206-b70f-20ac11681eb0-3
00:31:27.495 --> 00:31:30.880
this happen. The bad men are
going away on their boat.

8108a10b-5e01-49ea-a593-ccc778762361-0
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.978
And on the next page, we've got
the King and his child. They're

8108a10b-5e01-49ea-a593-ccc778762361-1
00:31:35.978 --> 00:31:40.102
standing off to the side, the
man and his red marker child.

8108a10b-5e01-49ea-a593-ccc778762361-2
00:31:40.102 --> 00:31:44.364
The red marker child is giving
him a hug and there's a little

8108a10b-5e01-49ea-a593-ccc778762361-3
00:31:44.364 --> 00:31:48.900
door next to them. It looks like
it was that little door from the

8108a10b-5e01-49ea-a593-ccc778762361-4
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.230
the office that was too small
for a person to fit through, but

8108a10b-5e01-49ea-a593-ccc778762361-5
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.430
they're on the other side of it.

3bde4ee1-621e-492f-ac86-72a9b255d4e9-0
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.560
And we can move on.

af0a443e-37f2-4ff9-b914-69a5f7055262-0
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.199
And then at the end we see the
red kite that's flying in the

af0a443e-37f2-4ff9-b914-69a5f7055262-1
00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:11.660
wind and we're back at the.

20134a3f-ead8-47b6-941b-f2e9419f5234-0
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:17.488
House, the little door in that
in the office is now open. You

20134a3f-ead8-47b6-941b-f2e9419f5234-1
00:32:17.488 --> 00:32:22.487
can just see like light coming
through it. We don't see any of

20134a3f-ead8-47b6-941b-f2e9419f5234-2
00:32:22.487 --> 00:32:23.360
the people.

4c2ef392-6901-4461-8d22-27d89c58c461-0
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.964
And we see the city, we see the
outside. So we're we're back in

4c2ef392-6901-4461-8d22-27d89c58c461-1
00:32:29.964 --> 00:32:30.480
the city.

9e804316-b7d3-4565-885b-440720a13c5c-0
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:35.660
We're back in real time and
that's it. #END_return

7f7b1080-4497-46e2-b31f-dbf17b0106e0-0
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.790
OK, you are muted.

a1780932-266d-4c26-aec3-977f5cab0d57-0
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:48.050
All right. So that was perfect
if you'd like to take like a two

a1780932-266d-4c26-aec3-977f5cab0d57-1

dd228d5c-96cf-453e-9002-531c8833d303-0
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.486

Oh, wait.

df1dd347-5e1e-4a2f-8ebf-f0b42ada1951-0
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.940
I could get rid of.

7c200b4a-7c8e-4f95-81c0-5c020511f84c-0
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.090
That's good.

505cfa0d-673e-4764-96c1-bcf7bf71b6aa-0
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.670
I'm just not sure why.

91535f40-0790-4833-995d-12a64e6de1f8-0
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.790

5a025654-cfea-48c8-bd5b-b5b01eb5fa22-0
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.830
Let me see if maybe if I make
it.

32a28bc7-f46a-4025-b7ea-4a83063c1f3e-0
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.660
Bigger first if that works.

4d96e01d-4817-47d4-86e9-96474d312e5e-0
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.350
Well, I don't know if I could do
it backwards like this actually.

17364a96-d1f5-4d51-9b88-fe6a86b90566-0
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.640
Oh, here.

3ad0ce62-b919-4480-adf0-c8480c406af6-0
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.302
How about now? Yep, that's
perfect. OK, I don't know how I

3ad0ce62-b919-4480-adf0-c8480c406af6-1
00:35:36.302 --> 00:35:38.020
got it like this, but OK.

381ea1fc-4797-4398-926e-be6ce646c185-0
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.208
Alright. Yeah, I know it looks
good. Let me know when you're

381ea1fc-4797-4398-926e-be6ce646c185-1
00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:45.513
ready. Yep, you could start. OK,
alright.

381ea1fc-4797-4398-926e-be6ce646c185-2
00:35:45.513 --> 00:35:48.642
#START_escape_from_the_zoo So
this is a picture. It says

381ea1fc-4797-4398-926e-be6ce646c185-3
00:35:48.642 --> 00:35:49.740
escape from the zoo.

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-0
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:55.580
We are at the zoo. There's lots
of people here. There is a

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-1
00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.215
rhinoceros. It looks like it is
escaping. It's like among the

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-2
00:36:00.215 --> 00:36:04.924
people and they are running from
it. There's a there's a snake

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-3
00:36:04.924 --> 00:36:09.111
along with them, there's a
giraffe. Now those are in an

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-4
00:36:09.111 --> 00:36:13.895
enclosure here. So we've got a
giraffe and then and a couple of

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-5
00:36:13.895 --> 00:36:18.305
giraffes, a few giraffes I
should say, and enclosure along

f863cdce-d5d3-4507-89b9-289a7d26ac29-6
00:36:18.305 --> 00:36:20.100
with some other animals.

a2676716-af97-4075-9cf4-10f9004b9d96-0
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.674
There's a hot dog vendor and
he's just right over there by

a2676716-af97-4075-9cf4-10f9004b9d96-1
00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:30.063
the escaped rhinoceros and he
seems OK. There's still people

a2676716-af97-4075-9cf4-10f9004b9d96-2
00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:34.236
buying hot dogs, but he's
chasing, he's kind of going the

a2676716-af97-4075-9cf4-10f9004b9d96-3
00:36:34.236 --> 00:36:38.697
other way, chasing some of the
other people there is. There's

a2676716-af97-4075-9cf4-10f9004b9d96-4
00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:43.229
all kinds of animals. Most of
them are in enclosures as far as

a2676716-af97-4075-9cf4-10f9004b9d96-5
00:36:43.229 --> 00:36:45.460
I can tell. We've got apes and.

d6c01357-9666-4a0c-a26e-5130d6433752-0
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:51.299
Baboons. There's a bunch of
birds, a whole bunch of

d6c01357-9666-4a0c-a26e-5130d6433752-1
00:36:51.299 --> 00:36:56.801
different kinds of birds.
There's lemurs, there's polar

d6c01357-9666-4a0c-a26e-5130d6433752-2
00:36:56.801 --> 00:37:02.992
bears, there's zebra, there's
flamingos. There's a lion. Maybe

d6c01357-9666-4a0c-a26e-5130d6433752-3
00:37:02.992 --> 00:37:05.940
a tiger with it, or two lions.

a0001b3a-9114-4055-b7b4-1102b3923cf0-0
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.350

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.310
That's one of the.

56bd5679-cc99-4e09-9aa1-0d72ebabe7c4-0
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:19.015
There's like an ice, ice thing
that looks like there should be

56bd5679-cc99-4e09-9aa1-0d72ebabe7c4-1
00:37:19.015 --> 00:37:22.977
an animal there, but I don't see
an animal, so maybe, I'm not

56bd5679-cc99-4e09-9aa1-0d72ebabe7c4-2
00:37:22.977 --> 00:37:26.620
sure what escape from there.
There's an ice cream stand,

56bd5679-cc99-4e09-9aa1-0d72ebabe7c4-3
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.240

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:38.610
an owl. There's something in a
little plane. There's like like

02de390b-5a03-4eee-a544-7cc610958ee7-1
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:44.048
a bird, like a little. It's like
a cartoon when it's in a little

02de390b-5a03-4eee-a544-7cc610958ee7-2
00:37:44.048 --> 00:37:44.550
plane.

26b702f5-f6ab-42cc-9bc6-6f50ff9672e4-0
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.730
There's a hippo, there's a
Peacock.

55a7bab0-9296-488c-a6e5-c5e98b21758b-0
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.620
There's people with babies.

ee4b4289-1a4a-47b9-85c5-2bd3d6a851a4-0
00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:00.512
There's children and dived one
of the enclosures, oh, because

ee4b4289-1a4a-47b9-85c5-2bd3d6a851a4-1
00:38:00.512 --> 00:38:03.806
they're running away from the
rhinoceros, so they are like

ee4b4289-1a4a-47b9-85c5-2bd3d6a851a4-2
00:38:03.806 --> 00:38:06.990
running into the the Lions den.
#END_escape_from_the_zoo

51d4bef7-5f21-4d6f-ab5d-93dbed878f7b-0
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.190
Yeah. Do you want me to keep
going?

69ae25e1-11fb-4a98-940f-f1426d62f37b-0
00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.690
OK. And I will.

380e4e43-2609-4ea1-882a-f70d0a1a988f-0

After this one escape.

a7569a95-3da4-48e7-9426-bca5398d559b-0
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.480
OK, next we have another complex
scene.

b77da67b-f7e8-4c5b-8525-901ad5f75415-0
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.000
I'm going to pull it up.

a0743211-6e7b-40e1-83f0-beacb9be32cd-0
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:01.780
Um.

98b02e92-942a-4d66-927d-48d036f9837b-0
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.819
I don't remember how I went made
it then it's OK. I mean, I could

98b02e92-942a-4d66-927d-48d036f9837b-1
00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:09.630
do it with it like this.

7006e5dd-498c-4fd0-8044-3182c0699f42-0
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:15.416
Yeah, it's black again with a
circle. So did I like go like

7006e5dd-498c-4fd0-8044-3182c0699f42-1
00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:15.830
this?

262255fa-9365-4b4a-b515-c9bba8bae583-0
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:30.270
And then I think I shared my
screen. Let me see.

254c92ff-d2d4-4025-8126-ec8dda392f76-0
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.540
Umm.

a7ffe05d-2836-418a-a434-92b240c25cc1-0
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:42.650
There we go.

8672faf6-fc0a-4f9b-bf0b-3ebe1a388d14-0
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.950
Yep, that's good.

67d6b59d-15df-4f98-8336-5d639ee6542e-0
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.740
So same thing. It's a complex
scene. Describe what you see.

9eed2589-168d-496a-b102-e7d2cec7976d-0
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:57.743
#START_make_a_splash All right.
So we're at a water park. There

9eed2589-168d-496a-b102-e7d2cec7976d-1
00:39:57.743 --> 00:40:01.616
is all kinds of really fun
looking slides. There are some

9eed2589-168d-496a-b102-e7d2cec7976d-2
00:40:01.616 --> 00:40:01.950
like.

895ff846-7bcb-4032-864f-79641dcb584f-0
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.268
Swirly slides or some straight
slides with some bumps. There's

895ff846-7bcb-4032-864f-79641dcb584f-1
00:40:07.268 --> 00:40:11.310
like a lazy river with people in
inner tubes. There's.

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-0
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:16.866
There's like a let's see, it's
like a ship with a bunch of kids

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-1
00:40:16.866 --> 00:40:20.650
on it and that's got a little
slide that goes down as well.

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-2
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.246
There's some spouts of water
that's coming down on them.

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-3
00:40:24.246 --> 00:40:28.219
There's there's tons of people
like the people are like on top

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-4
00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:32.066
of each other. There's a ton of
them. There's a kid with a a

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-5
00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:35.977

inner tube. There's some people

c6f356c7-3d3c-4767-a5f4-69cd16e1ebcb-7
00:40:40.014 --> 00:40:42.600

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.444
There's kids at the top of the
slide waiting to go down the

e16778f0-9d5b-403d-869b-bf7ccd49cd46-1
00:40:50.444 --> 00:40:53.598

letting them all go down. Like

00:40:56.753 --> 00:40:59.907
They're not like making weight

e16778f0-9d5b-403d-869b-bf7ccd49cd46-4
00:40:59.907 --> 00:41:01.799

There's.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.050
The top of the boat

7886b95a-498d-429f-8b8a-21a908455003-0
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:10.522
They're like ship has a spout
with water and it's going down

7886b95a-498d-429f-8b8a-21a908455003-1

the boat that people can climb
on. There's a girl climbing on

7886b95a-498d-429f-8b8a-21a908455003-3
00:41:19.987 --> 00:41:24.961

00:41:24.961 --> 00:41:29.934
say like a net climb. And then
there's a dragon with a spout.

7886b95a-498d-429f-8b8a-21a908455003-5
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:34.907
It's like spouting water and the
kids are kind of climbing on

7886b95a-498d-429f-8b8a-21a908455003-6

de6ac853-edd5-49dc-8703-eb7a0a1124f8-0

There's like a snake thing. I
mean it's just like, you know, a

de6ac853-edd5-49dc-8703-eb7a0a1124f8-1
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.530
fake thing in the water that the
kids are climbing and playing on

de6ac853-edd5-49dc-8703-eb7a0a1124f8-2

de6ac853-edd5-49dc-8703-eb7a0a1124f8-3
00:41:48.721 --> 00:41:52.579
little rocks or something that
they can go across and and

de6ac853-edd5-49dc-8703-eb7a0a1124f8-4

little platforms. I'm not sure

2a9036c8-4d86-4ada-b89c-5118e06dc5f5-1

Another complex scene.

OK.

9c3e3d83-796c-46ae-98eb-9865fd895a74-0
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:03.230
Alright, so I'm just describing
the scene, right? I'm not like

9c3e3d83-796c-46ae-98eb-9865fd895a74-1
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.401

OK, OK, alright. That's what I

9c3e3d83-796c-46ae-98eb-9865fd895a74-2
00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:09.320

e5abd523-ce42-4023-80b1-9bbb925bfeb6-0

Hey, I just wanted to make sure
I was doing it right. OK.

e5abd523-ce42-4023-80b1-9bbb925bfeb6-1
00:43:14.186 --> 00:43:17.869
#START_waldo_1 So yeah, so this
is it is a where's Waldo scene.

e5abd523-ce42-4023-80b1-9bbb925bfeb6-2
00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:21.148
So there is a lot of like red
and white stripe things on

e5abd523-ce42-4023-80b1-9bbb925bfeb6-3
00:43:21.148 --> 00:43:23.910
there. There is we are in the
middle of a town.

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-0
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:29.518
I think it looks like a cute
little town, all kinds of shops.

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-1
00:43:29.518 --> 00:43:33.590
There's a fountain in the middle
of the town. There's somebody

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-2
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.727
riding on the fountain. They've
got like flippers and a snorkel

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-3
00:43:37.727 --> 00:43:41.671
mask on. And then there are
there's cars all around. There's

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-4
00:43:41.671 --> 00:43:45.614
little shops and there's people.
There's also like a maybe a

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-5
00:43:45.614 --> 00:43:49.493
little festival or something
going on because there's tents

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-6
00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:53.630
with red and white stripes and
blue and white stripes and green

95d7e300-ec5d-484e-8efd-4c5fe222e82c-7

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:59.232
People all around there kind of
shopping at each of the tents.

61f3793f-16e2-467b-b76e-bd4af2c6c3c0-1
00:43:59.232 --> 00:44:02.701
There's a building that they
seem to be working on, or maybe

61f3793f-16e2-467b-b76e-bd4af2c6c3c0-2
00:44:02.701 --> 00:44:05.886
washing the windows or
something, because there's three

61f3793f-16e2-467b-b76e-bd4af2c6c3c0-3
00:44:05.886 --> 00:44:09.412
ladders there, and then there's
people on top of the building

61f3793f-16e2-467b-b76e-bd4af2c6c3c0-4
00:44:09.412 --> 00:44:12.824
and they're like mopping or
something, but they're fighting

61f3793f-16e2-467b-b76e-bd4af2c6c3c0-5
00:44:12.824 --> 00:44:16.520
with their mops. And then people
on top of another building. I'm

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.932
not sure why. It looks like
maybe the dog got away onto the

61f3793f-16e2-467b-b76e-bd4af2c6c3c0-7
00:44:19.932 --> 00:44:21.070
top of the building.

1bda1bf8-fbad-47ef-8d82-62658ce74553-0
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.049
And then there's people in the
window. There's like people

the place. There's there's a

5f25bd94-a525-46fa-ae2f-cb1b624eaaab-0

00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:52.361
looks like maybe like a little
Fender Bender. There's a red car

5f25bd94-a525-46fa-ae2f-cb1b624eaaab-3
00:44:52.361 --> 00:44:56.413
and a a yellow truck that got
into a Fender Bender. And

5f25bd94-a525-46fa-ae2f-cb1b624eaaab-4

5f25bd94-a525-46fa-ae2f-cb1b624eaaab-5
00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:04.010
out of the yellow truck. And
then there's.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.427
And then there's just like a
random guy on the side, not in a

08de3dee-e592-444e-a9be-d51de6161014-1
00:52:21.427 --> 00:52:26.236
portrait, like a caveman. Let's
see if we could describe some of

08de3dee-e592-444e-a9be-d51de6161014-2
00:52:26.236 --> 00:52:30.898
these things in the portraits.
So we've got this in one of the

08de3dee-e592-444e-a9be-d51de6161014-3
00:52:30.898 --> 00:52:34.450

people fighting.

a77f9148-1570-4508-a9a5-2c50b620d3c6-0
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.348
In one of the portraits there is
a guy in a like a full on green

a77f9148-1570-4508-a9a5-2c50b620d3c6-1

suit with a green hat and an
umbrella and a a briefcase.

a77f9148-1570-4508-a9a5-2c50b620d3c6-2
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:50.070
There's a person with a
backpack. There's.

81dc513d-72d5-4b86-9681-0fb2345cd710-0
00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.290

cb284a27-46bd-4164-8751-af186ad8ecd8-0
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.785
Let's see, there's a there's two
people near up like a palm tree,

cb284a27-46bd-4164-8751-af186ad8ecd8-1
00:52:57.785 --> 00:53:02.168
and one of them is leaning on
the palm tree and the other one

cb284a27-46bd-4164-8751-af186ad8ecd8-2
00:53:02.168 --> 00:53:06.481
like it almost looks like their
hair is attached to the palm

cb284a27-46bd-4164-8751-af186ad8ecd8-3
00:53:06.481 --> 00:53:08.390
tree. And then we've got a.

d7c06a52-0346-46ff-a485-b480d4bbb82b-0
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.572
Let's see, there's all kinds of
things going on and like every

d7c06a52-0346-46ff-a485-b480d4bbb82b-1
00:53:15.572 --> 00:53:19.186
picture or something different,
there's a lot of people fighting

d7c06a52-0346-46ff-a485-b480d4bbb82b-2
00:53:19.186 --> 00:53:22.299
in the pictures, like lots of
swords and lots of people

d7c06a52-0346-46ff-a485-b480d4bbb82b-3
00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:22.800
fighting.

23a306d6-071e-49f5-86f5-3513bd535aa7-0
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:27.460
There's.

833dd0f0-818b-42ad-8386-a3a080c237e0-0
00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:33.947
One of them was just like a a
weird looking hand with like

833dd0f0-818b-42ad-8386-a3a080c237e0-1
00:53:33.947 --> 00:53:39.259
maybe four rings on it. And then
there's a tree that has a face

833dd0f0-818b-42ad-8386-a3a080c237e0-2
00:53:39.259 --> 00:53:44.489
and it's like sticking out its
tongue. And there's a mummy and

833dd0f0-818b-42ad-8386-a3a080c237e0-3
00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:49.386
there's a dog on a leash.
There's a 2 headed fish. So like

833dd0f0-818b-42ad-8386-a3a080c237e0-4
00:53:49.386 --> 00:53:54.449
each side of the fish has a
head, there's no tail, it's just

833dd0f0-818b-42ad-8386-a3a080c237e0-5
00:53:54.449 --> 00:53:55.280
two heads.

5feb16e6-9dbc-4d98-b83e-7c17fee1908b-0
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:02.675
There's kind of looks like a guy
coming out of a garbage can or

5feb16e6-9dbc-4d98-b83e-7c17fee1908b-1
00:54:02.675 --> 00:54:05.910
something. There's two people
dressed up like.

b9779a3b-2cf7-4dcb-b6cf-95f96a7084d6-0
00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.610
Dogs, I think.

8c15f4d7-34ae-4b81-8290-080eaf3a7e53-0
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.220
Um.

d5c41e22-613f-4b56-bd20-e81f48518b2d-0

the thing where I.

243d6518-fb5c-40b3-bdc2-2f6756d255c1-0
00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.560
Slideshow.

67b2dfd8-b52e-4418-8db1-3eafbc069e61-0
00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:58.790
So.

218cf2df-7ba9-4586-b63d-001ae06dc444-0
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.350
This story is 3 slides long.

b7e7bdf2-7f6f-4216-82ca-9d9cecefe0b0-0
00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:09.493
And like before with the
stories, just let me know when

b7e7bdf2-7f6f-4216-82ca-9d9cecefe0b0-1
00:55:09.493 --> 00:55:11.570
you'd like me to move on to the
next slide.

520a7d52-5840-4914-b80e-a1dafcc49f43-0
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:15.804
OK, about how long do you want
me to take to describe the

520a7d52-5840-4914-b80e-a1dafcc49f43-1
00:55:15.804 --> 00:55:16.160
story?

5c6687a8-2495-4a6b-880b-5120029683df-0
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.819
This one I mean, it's only three
slides, so between 5 and 10

5c6687a8-2495-4a6b-880b-5120029683df-1
00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:25.160
minutes in between it, it might
take less.

80264281-1a4c-4320-b70c-15ac7df770cf-0
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.676
Definitely not more. Yeah. OK,
got it. All right.

80264281-1a4c-4320-b70c-15ac7df770cf-1
00:55:29.676 --> 00:55:34.297
#START_arrival_2 So it looks
like an like an old timey story.

80264281-1a4c-4320-b70c-15ac7df770cf-2
00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:36.980
We're looking at pictures that
are.

b2835984-66a6-43e9-96b4-441e9b34d247-0
00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:42.430
They're not black and white. I
think it's called sepia and.

490c8744-49a3-42c4-b415-3bc004681a7c-0
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:48.004
Just a bunch of pictures. So the
first picture it looks like a a

490c8744-49a3-42c4-b415-3bc004681a7c-1
00:55:48.004 --> 00:55:49.340
man, woman and a child.

defb0406-b6cb-4774-afc8-02073ddd5e9f-0
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.370
And they're dressed up in like
they've got like head coverings.

dd2a3d1f-24eb-4d9e-90a2-abdad34094f5-0
00:55:55.810 --> 00:56:00.685
And long. It's like a long white
head covering outfit. They have

dd2a3d1f-24eb-4d9e-90a2-abdad34094f5-1
00:56:00.685 --> 00:56:04.660
luggage with them and then the
next picture it is 3.

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-0
00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:09.435
Look like men with hats and
suits, and they have luggage as

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-1
00:56:09.435 --> 00:56:13.657
well. There's a woman with a
baby and a man behind her. So it

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-2
00:56:13.657 --> 00:56:17.811
looks like maybe we're at a
scene at like a don't know, some

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-3
00:56:17.811 --> 00:56:21.828
sort of transportation place.
And then we see a man with a

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-4
00:56:21.828 --> 00:56:26.050
hat. He's sitting on a piece of
luggage and he has a book and

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-5
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.068
he's writing in his book and
we're looking at him writing.

cc768790-a02a-4adb-97b6-a3c98a787993-6
00:56:30.068 --> 00:56:32.860
We're watching him tearing the
page out.

53c1b0cc-70df-4764-ba40-ef0398215339-0
00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:39.434
And then he's folding it up
into, I think it's like a swan.

53c1b0cc-70df-4764-ba40-ef0398215339-1
00:56:39.434 --> 00:56:44.644
So he folds up the page into a
swan and he's looking at it, and

53c1b0cc-70df-4764-ba40-ef0398215339-2
00:56:44.644 --> 00:56:49.040
then he's looking behind him and
now he's getting up.

8804847c-05db-4dd1-b2b9-a10b5e761298-0
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:53.908
And he's looking, let's see,
he's looking behind him. And

8804847c-05db-4dd1-b2b9-a10b5e761298-1
00:56:53.908 --> 00:56:58.117
then he's looking up and he's
kind of got his hands on his

8804847c-05db-4dd1-b2b9-a10b5e761298-2
00:56:58.117 --> 00:57:01.970
forehead looking up. And now
we're looking at a boat.

f13dff73-5ee3-4f66-98c7-e1f6dd2d6579-0
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.365
There's a bunch of people on the
boat and there's a whole bunch

f13dff73-5ee3-4f66-98c7-e1f6dd2d6579-1
00:57:05.365 --> 00:57:05.490
of.

64dfcbab-4c33-4313-9ca9-22aa7bcfa841-0
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:11.323
What are those? I don't know if
that's the paper like it. Maybe

64dfcbab-4c33-4313-9ca9-22aa7bcfa841-1
00:57:11.323 --> 00:57:13.420
those are the paper things
they're like.

5a04cdf6-f95c-4467-9354-9f115f4c5f46-0
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.590
Paper.

d0e7b26c-4a37-4c35-9ff7-3850b6dae59c-0
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:20.268
Dragonflies above them, and
they're all kind of like looking

d0e7b26c-4a37-4c35-9ff7-3850b6dae59c-1
00:57:20.268 --> 00:57:24.103
up at them. They're all on the
boat and they're all kind of

d0e7b26c-4a37-4c35-9ff7-3850b6dae59c-2
00:57:24.103 --> 00:57:27.810
looking up. So maybe so he
whatever he folded it into, if

d0e7b26c-4a37-4c35-9ff7-3850b6dae59c-3
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:31.708
it's a swan or a dragonfly,
that's like above all the people

d0e7b26c-4a37-4c35-9ff7-3850b6dae59c-4
00:57:31.708 --> 00:57:35.159
now, and they're all on a that
looks like a big ship.

57bbe2ef-8e0c-4330-bdc6-ba6177609875-0
00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:36.740
Umm.

41d0f985-3836-4e53-baaf-7b23add995f8-0
00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:40.140
{OK, we can move on to the next
page.}

acfa52d1-3ddb-4368-9cdb-2e0ac6adbc57-0
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.630
OK, and now so we're we're still
on the ship.

04aedc12-ead4-4351-8085-2df61d7ec5a2-0
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:48.520
Umm.

c3cd27e5-a6f8-4c35-817b-518ee2755710-0
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:54.478
They are looking out at the
water and there's some other

c3cd27e5-a6f8-4c35-817b-518ee2755710-1
00:57:54.478 --> 00:57:56.420
boats and other ships.

0ec18ddc-6594-4846-8136-f95f31fcdf89-0
00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.070
And a big city.

7192527f-bf65-4bf2-bbf0-f91c35fcfe7f-0
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.250
Like birds in the sky.

66a73433-e560-4b86-aed3-3f5e85917be2-0
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.690
And then on the next page it is.

6e979437-b77b-47c5-887c-884b35c4b1a3-0
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.971
I don't know if those are like
concrete structures or what they

6e979437-b77b-47c5-887c-884b35c4b1a3-1
00:58:13.971 --> 00:58:14.960
are, but it's like a.

bb381ac8-8495-4397-b769-083ce91aefb3-0
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.668
Some sort of structure where
there's people shaking hands.

bb381ac8-8495-4397-b769-083ce91aefb3-1
00:58:20.668 --> 00:58:24.610
The one has a bird on its
shoulder, the other one has.

242d4c60-1fd8-4da4-8115-124df3173261-0
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.559
like a rabbit or some sort of
animal on there, they're

242d4c60-1fd8-4da4-8115-124df3173261-1
00:58:29.559 --> 00:58:33.660
holding. And then they're so the
one with the, they're both

242d4c60-1fd8-4da4-8115-124df3173261-2
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.780
wearing hats, the one with the.

77dd47a4-4e30-4a10-af03-c748674607fa-0
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.679
Rabbit. I don't know if it's a
rabbit or not, but some sort of

77dd47a4-4e30-4a10-af03-c748674607fa-1
00:58:40.679 --> 00:58:44.831
animal like that. The one with
the rabbit, let's just say has

77dd47a4-4e30-4a10-af03-c748674607fa-2
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:47.510
luggage and a like a teacup and
a vase.

33d1c2f4-14f2-46aa-b28d-a087695cb4c4-0
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:53.991
And it's on like a like a little
ship, and then the one with the

33d1c2f4-14f2-46aa-b28d-a087695cb4c4-1
00:58:53.991 --> 00:58:54.780
bird has.

510003c5-5447-44c7-930a-d00d7f53ac51-0
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:59.160
Teapots and a big.

2d008188-4ecf-4376-8b87-41ca7a2a9e7d-0
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:05.413
pot and like a triangle, some
sort of triangle thing. It's

2d008188-4ecf-4376-8b87-41ca7a2a9e7d-1
00:59:05.413 --> 00:59:09.127
also on like a ship looking
thing. And these are giant

2d008188-4ecf-4376-8b87-41ca7a2a9e7d-2
00:59:09.127 --> 00:59:13.381
because there's big boats around
and these are way bigger than

2d008188-4ecf-4376-8b87-41ca7a2a9e7d-3
00:59:13.381 --> 00:59:17.567
the boats and they're also way
bigger than the buildings that

2d008188-4ecf-4376-8b87-41ca7a2a9e7d-4
00:59:17.567 --> 00:59:21.484
are in the town. And and the
buildings are high rises. So

2d008188-4ecf-4376-8b87-41ca7a2a9e7d-5
00:59:21.484 --> 00:59:23.510
these are very very very tall.

df8268f6-6fe4-4798-b98d-42722c47425a-0
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.010
{OK. Can you go back to the next
page?}

958facc7-070d-432f-a393-f598014c46eb-0
00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:33.409
And now we're looking at this
ship from a different angle. We

958facc7-070d-432f-a393-f598014c46eb-1
00:59:33.409 --> 00:59:37.485
still see all those little like
paper dragonflies. They're like

958facc7-070d-432f-a393-f598014c46eb-2
00:59:37.485 --> 00:59:38.249
coming down.

6eef8628-4476-4769-b042-bce6c06d747d-0
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.150
Around the ship and there's.

7f126257-0e86-4ea3-8d07-d61fa7fa84db-0
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:43.790
Clouds in the sky.

115ae7f6-d670-4fed-9593-3e487501f265-0
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:49.172
We're kind of looking at the
ship from a different angle

115ae7f6-d670-4fed-9593-3e487501f265-1
00:59:49.172 --> 00:59:52.920
here, and then on the next page
we've got a group of people.

57b13772-a45f-4bb9-9f16-c9f0aad5375a-0
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:58.988
Some of the people that we found
in the very beginning and then

57b13772-a45f-4bb9-9f16-c9f0aad5375a-1
00:59:58.988 --> 01:00:01.920
we've got a man with a big
megaphone.

4c313cf1-c755-410e-97e7-4e86926e7503-0
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:06.636
Pointing and they're opening up
something and they must be

4c313cf1-c755-410e-97e7-4e86926e7503-1
01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:10.456
opening up the ship for more
people maybe. And then we're

4c313cf1-c755-410e-97e7-4e86926e7503-2
01:00:10.456 --> 01:00:11.840
seeing a hand with a.

ba0c1fb6-7d34-49b4-bfb9-cd69f7116edd-0
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.714
On luggage. So he's like holding
on to his luggage handle and

ba0c1fb6-7d34-49b4-bfb9-cd69f7116edd-1
01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:20.875
then we've got the people again,
they've all got their luggage

ba0c1fb6-7d34-49b4-bfb9-cd69f7116edd-2
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:23.979
and the next slide is a whole
bunch of people.

6a5be2ec-d9db-4cc8-9b0d-467fe57921d0-0
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.986
Walking maybe like walking the
plank towards the boat and then

6a5be2ec-d9db-4cc8-9b0d-467fe57921d0-1
01:00:29.986 --> 01:00:31.400
the last slide is.

6be93cc4-f5c8-48e1-ab8e-3a2f30b063cb-0
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.092
A bunch of people all with their
luggage standing in line.

6be93cc4-f5c8-48e1-ab8e-3a2f30b063cb-1
01:00:36.092 --> 01:00:36.840
#END_arrival_2

62056a19-24f0-4a44-95f8-3ee3d7895462-0
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.110
Yeah.

9ce2ddca-e907-41eb-8685-219b87d972f0-0
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:43.730
OK.

c38a2de1-267b-4b7b-9af4-f15dab63d9ee-0
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.680
Let me see what's.

ff129b29-18fc-4417-a262-eda3bd610a62-0
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:49.470
Next.

39abf103-acda-492f-9677-77e9caf0745e-0
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.940
OK, now we have another short
story.

7a705249-afce-4246-bf34-08d12a8d4817-0
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:02.800
OK.

08590bf8-6b33-42f7-9d37-48a96abd4a88-0
01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:06.610
This one is.

5716112a-b50c-408e-b6b0-00ccf9dffa32-0
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.270
Six slides, OK.

2d303fb9-cbdd-4860-a9e0-a8737249ea97-0
01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:13.710
Ohh.

d2c400e9-714f-4a12-9ea3-b1fe51c01b62-0
01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:37.113
#START_arrival_6 All right, so
we have another old timey story

d2c400e9-714f-4a12-9ea3-b1fe51c01b62-1
01:01:37.113 --> 01:01:40.110
with those sepia looking colors
we start out.

01a9e0b1-fd8f-40bc-aab1-a70ab1089c2c-0
01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:45.540
With a like a vase and then.

79ecedef-c734-4217-9b0e-68fb2e363e6a-0
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:48.830
I think coming towards the vase,
it's like a.

24e956ea-5df7-4c98-80f4-a1ca57a754be-0
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.586
I don't know what that thing is.
It looks similar to the last

24e956ea-5df7-4c98-80f4-a1ca57a754be-1
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:58.407
story. It's like a dragonfly
paper dragonfly or something,

24e956ea-5df7-4c98-80f4-a1ca57a754be-2
01:01:58.407 --> 01:02:00.610
and then it's coming to the
vase.

212881eb-bcb9-451a-bb18-0f055a671ebb-0
01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:07.249
It's like standing on the edge
of the vase. So we've got a man

212881eb-bcb9-451a-bb18-0f055a671ebb-1
01:02:07.249 --> 01:02:12.450
with he's wearing. I'm thinking
it's a man in a mirror. I can't

212881eb-bcb9-451a-bb18-0f055a671ebb-2
01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:16.920
see the head. He's wearing a
vest and holding on to a.

7f02763c-b774-4d99-ac06-5d92303ef574-0
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:23.048
Like a pen that you have to dip
in ink with a piece of paper and

7f02763c-b774-4d99-ac06-5d92303ef574-1
01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:27.602
then the the vase is right there
and he's writing something on

7f02763c-b774-4d99-ac06-5d92303ef574-2
01:02:27.602 --> 01:02:31.650
the paper, folding it up,
there's some money next to it

7f02763c-b774-4d99-ac06-5d92303ef574-3
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:35.554
sitting next to it along with
like a pepper shaker or

7f02763c-b774-4d99-ac06-5d92303ef574-4
01:02:35.554 --> 01:02:37.000
something. And then.

e274c3d2-cef4-492d-895b-49e1df8f7948-0
01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.565
He folds it up into that shape,
whatever that is. It's like a

e274c3d2-cef4-492d-895b-49e1df8f7948-1
01:02:43.565 --> 01:02:44.850
bird. It's like a.

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-0
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:49.979
Like a paper, or I mean, it's,
it's kind of cool. It's like

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-1
01:02:49.979 --> 01:02:54.148
origami for sure. But I think
it's a bird. And he puts that in

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-2
01:02:54.148 --> 01:02:58.316
an envelope and then he's adding
the money to the envelope and

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-3
01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:02.485
he's licking the envelope and
then he's putting a stamp on the

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-4
01:03:02.485 --> 01:03:06.719
envelope. Now he's walking with
the envelope. I don't know what

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-5
01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:10.888
that is next to him. It's some
sort of animal next to him. I'm

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-6
01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:14.990
walking down the stairs and then
he runs into a woman and she

f7616c48-4159-40ee-80d0-543ffc96fd6d-7
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:16.380
seems to have a tail.

521bd739-eb40-4c04-af27-3a78c568c28b-0
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:21.630
And she's pointing at something,
she's holding a basket, and then

521bd739-eb40-4c04-af27-3a78c568c28b-1
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:25.350
he's walking over to. I mean, it
must be like a.

a76ff26e-61ac-48e7-b426-ace95f84a052-0
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:30.153
A mailbox doesn't look like a
mailbox from today, but maybe

a76ff26e-61ac-48e7-b426-ace95f84a052-1
01:03:30.153 --> 01:03:34.043
like an old time mailbox. He's
reading whatever it says on it

a76ff26e-61ac-48e7-b426-ace95f84a052-2
01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:37.681
and then he's putting the
letter. So that's the folded up

a76ff26e-61ac-48e7-b426-ace95f84a052-3
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.759
thing in the envelope along with
the money into it. And now he's

a76ff26e-61ac-48e7-b426-ace95f84a052-4
01:03:41.759 --> 01:03:45.836
looking up at the sky and now he
and his animal are walking away

a76ff26e-61ac-48e7-b426-ace95f84a052-5
01:03:45.836 --> 01:03:49.349
from it and there's like a bunch
of leaves on the page.

90258f06-97d2-40f4-b961-0832819a1d61-0
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.540
And like a whole scene.

a4ce4a55-1e37-4a53-8865-bb9adaae8ad8-0
01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.210
{Move on to the next page.

89998d6c-2bd9-4970-a1a2-e7a4b074bda6-0
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:57.390
Oh.

469a77c0-ecf1-4397-93f4-3d4506120ae5-0
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:00.590
There we go.}

68e1ee16-77b9-453a-8a36-8d35f9771f33-0
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:04.988
OK, OK, now we're looking at the
individual leaves. So we've got

68e1ee16-77b9-453a-8a36-8d35f9771f33-1
01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:08.573
a leaf. So this is like from the
other page. There was a whole

68e1ee16-77b9-453a-8a36-8d35f9771f33-2
01:04:08.573 --> 01:04:12.214
bunch of these like giant leaves
on the page along with him. So

68e1ee16-77b9-453a-8a36-8d35f9771f33-3
01:04:12.214 --> 01:04:15.458
now we're looking at an
individual leaf and then it gets

68e1ee16-77b9-453a-8a36-8d35f9771f33-4
01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:19.042
cut down the center and then it
gets cut a little further. And

68e1ee16-77b9-453a-8a36-8d35f9771f33-5
01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:20.749
now we're moving on to like a.

5d000b3a-a2c2-46bf-a68e-39843096b7f4-0
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.469
Kind of. I mean, it kind of
looks like a flower and then

5d000b3a-a2c2-46bf-a68e-39843096b7f4-1
01:04:25.469 --> 01:04:29.678
it's getting bigger and bigger
and there's some little things

5d000b3a-a2c2-46bf-a68e-39843096b7f4-2
01:04:29.678 --> 01:04:33.887
coming out of it that sort of
look like the the paper that he

5d000b3a-a2c2-46bf-a68e-39843096b7f4-3
01:04:33.887 --> 01:04:38.164
folded up into the origami. And
I've got another flower again,

5d000b3a-a2c2-46bf-a68e-39843096b7f4-4
01:04:38.164 --> 01:04:41.830
there's that origami paper
coming out of it and then.

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-0
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.989
And then we're moving on to
another flower, and that flower

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-1
01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:50.758
has black, and it's getting, the
black is coming off of it. So

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-2
01:04:50.758 --> 01:04:54.467
like the black part is getting
smaller, but you can still see

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-3
01:04:54.467 --> 01:04:58.296
the outline of the flower, but
the black color is coming off of

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-4
01:04:58.296 --> 01:05:02.065
it. And then. Oh, wait, OK. So
it looks like it actually moves

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-5
01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.954
across the page. I was trying to
do 2 separate pages. OK, so the

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-6
01:05:05.954 --> 01:05:09.603
first one, so we're back to the
leaf, so it's split down the

ec93afe8-4cfe-4e83-bdcf-af7707f1a592-7
01:05:09.603 --> 01:05:10.800
middle and now it's.

ae45d337-c2f3-4513-9f8b-a10064d20644-0
01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.211
There's like a stem growing from
the top and then by the time we

ae45d337-c2f3-4513-9f8b-a10064d20644-1
01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:18.210
get to the end it's got like a.

5688920d-c0a8-4f81-b14d-17cd4af4be5f-0
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:23.545
Circle on top and the Leaf has
split into almost like it looks

5688920d-c0a8-4f81-b14d-17cd4af4be5f-1
01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:27.450
like wings. The second picture
with the flower where the

5688920d-c0a8-4f81-b14d-17cd4af4be5f-2
01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:31.150
origami was coming out of it,
it's just getting like.

cb6aba34-d2b0-4c7e-a4a6-e95640666f78-0
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.362
It just looks kind of bright and
then it looks like it's kind of

cb6aba34-d2b0-4c7e-a4a6-e95640666f78-1
01:05:35.362 --> 01:05:36.710
like one of those little.

c1708e87-4347-42ba-9d00-f3d73d614be6-0
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.356
I don't know. People call them
like snowman flowers, but

c1708e87-4347-42ba-9d00-f3d73d614be6-1
01:05:41.356 --> 01:05:44.039
they're the they're kind of like
some people call them weeds,

c1708e87-4347-42ba-9d00-f3d73d614be6-2
01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:46.678
some people call them flowers
are the ones that you can blow

c1708e87-4347-42ba-9d00-f3d73d614be6-3
01:05:46.678 --> 01:05:49.447
on and it looks like the little
parts are blowing away and then

c1708e87-4347-42ba-9d00-f3d73d614be6-4
01:05:49.447 --> 01:05:50.140
we're left with.

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-0
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:56.118
Without the the little snowy
parts of it. And then the third

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-1
01:05:56.118 --> 01:06:00.247
one, we also had the flower and
also had the origami parts.

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-2
01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:04.583
There's something underneath it,
I don't know what's happening

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-3
01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:08.919
there. And then the flower just
turns like blacker and blacker

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-4
01:06:08.919 --> 01:06:12.980
and it's by the end it's all
black. Now the other one that

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-5
01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.247
was that started out almost all
black is losing its black and

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-6
01:06:17.247 --> 01:06:21.445
the black is like going down
almost into it looks like. It's

086eb6cc-d623-46c8-9c2f-12f776d700a0-7
01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:21.790
like.

27dc1b07-45c2-4ad6-b725-3de30e52b66d-0
01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.961
sitting in the snow and the
like, the little black pieces

27dc1b07-45c2-4ad6-b725-3de30e52b66d-1
01:06:25.961 --> 01:06:30.486
are going into the snow and now
it's like snowing on it. And by

27dc1b07-45c2-4ad6-b725-3de30e52b66d-2
01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:34.941
the end it is. It's snowed on
and the black parts are gone and

27dc1b07-45c2-4ad6-b725-3de30e52b66d-3
01:06:34.941 --> 01:06:39.325
it's it's a flower that has an
outline and the black parts of

27dc1b07-45c2-4ad6-b725-3de30e52b66d-4
01:06:39.325 --> 01:06:42.789
it are gone. {We can move on to
the next shoot.}

a0261c94-f004-4676-b34a-745354018662-0
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:47.720
Um, OK, so this is.

efad5c37-981b-401a-a3e7-7714335e3a49-0
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.100
And I'm now.

ed68a2ae-2b5f-49f5-946d-253c9b543ccd-0
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.990
It looks it's outdoors.

7be04957-81a3-49de-87f0-350bd97f276c-0
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.090
There's like chimneys with smoke
coming out of them.

4175c8f9-c7f6-424f-a4cf-8f497fd449b4-0
01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:08.560
Maybe some sort of a? Maybe it's
a factory?

17fe9f68-9026-4860-a971-61e86b943bbf-0
01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.170
Umm.

9d5b8a56-5ec6-45e6-86da-b54fa0ec6e02-0
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:17.696
There's a it looks like it's a
person walking next to it, that

9d5b8a56-5ec6-45e6-86da-b54fa0ec6e02-1
01:07:17.696 --> 01:07:19.920
kind of like a like a shadow
person.

ee87b2d8-f415-4273-8593-5b808daf4528-0
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:22.760
There's.

8c01aabd-7b2b-49d5-ac12-f01de89340ca-0
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.500
Just a lot of chimneys.

fcb85348-8e4b-4345-95c5-d451713a2a7b-0
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.370
And there's it looks like
there's snow on the ground.

bd931bc0-2a9a-4bb5-8ac9-66a88fc15e00-0
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:39.010
There's some smoke in the
picture.

122fbbc8-c73f-4c24-8f8f-f16cea58c4c9-0
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.123
Some of the buildings are
circular and some of them are

122fbbc8-c73f-4c24-8f8f-f16cea58c4c9-1
01:07:44.123 --> 01:07:47.790
triangle shape, so they're
really different shape buildings

122fbbc8-c73f-4c24-8f8f-f16cea58c4c9-2
01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:48.830
than I'm used to.

471a0b77-5c3f-45bb-8acf-d650e12acc2a-0
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.444
I'm not 100% sure what's
happening in these pictures, but

471a0b77-5c3f-45bb-8acf-d650e12acc2a-1
01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.510
that's my best description of
it.

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-0
01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.140
{And move on to the next one.}
OK, so now we're back to the

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-1
01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.187
vase from the beginning. So
we've got the vase and then, oh,

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-2
01:08:06.187 --> 01:08:10.035
now the, the, the origami has
like children, so it's like

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-3
01:08:10.035 --> 01:08:14.280
little birds inside the vase and
it's coming to feed the little

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-4
01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.995
birds. And then we've got the
man and he's looking at a

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-5
01:08:17.995 --> 01:08:21.777
picture of what looks like a
family. It looks like maybe

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-6
01:08:21.777 --> 01:08:25.890
there's three people in it. So
he's got a picture in A frame.

c7a9d39b-5eac-48f4-bd1b-d848f582baf2-7
01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:27.350
He's, he's sitting in.

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-0
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:31.554
He's sitting in a bed and he's
looking at the picture. His desk

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-1
01:08:31.554 --> 01:08:35.724
is right next to him. That vase
is kind of off to the side there

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-2
01:08:35.724 --> 01:08:39.829
by the desk too. And then on the
next page his little animal is

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-3
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:43.805
there and it jumps off the bed.
He's got the picture frame in

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-4
01:08:43.805 --> 01:08:47.910
his hand and he's looking to see
where the animal went. And the

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-5
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:51.887
animal is going down a ladder.
It's like there's like a hole,

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-6
01:08:51.887 --> 01:08:56.056
maybe like a hole in the ground
and a ladder. So the animal went

eb3a8611-2520-4ba4-8935-3c6a7b97dc6f-7
01:08:56.056 --> 01:08:57.660
down the ladder, the man.

2818d002-bbdf-457d-a814-a6efc55a0983-0
01:08:57.730 --> 01:09:03.510
Follows him down the ladder. The
animal finds an envelope.

5bd91299-6af3-46e2-ae54-d47ca7398079-0
01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:09.110
Which looks like the letter from
the person in the beginning, so.

6ed1f2f9-7f3d-465f-8f52-f4faad628740-0
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.795
Same person? I don't know, but
this looks like the letter that

6ed1f2f9-7f3d-465f-8f52-f4faad628740-1
01:09:13.795 --> 01:09:16.859
was written in the beginning
because he picked up the

6ed1f2f9-7f3d-465f-8f52-f4faad628740-2
01:09:16.859 --> 01:09:17.370
envelope.

011cbb83-ca28-4238-9403-b83182de07fc-0
01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:21.643
He opened the envelope and
there's the origami inside of

011cbb83-ca28-4238-9403-b83182de07fc-1
01:09:21.643 --> 01:09:25.384
it. Now he's unraveling the
origami to read the letter, and

011cbb83-ca28-4238-9403-b83182de07fc-2
01:09:25.384 --> 01:09:29.186
now he's got the letter in his
hand and he's looking out the

011cbb83-ca28-4238-9403-b83182de07fc-3
01:09:29.186 --> 01:09:31.930
window. {You can move on to the
next page.}

dfcda12b-1f6a-42f8-833a-7e3684e774db-0
01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:39.556
And there's another origami in
the first picture, and then the

dfcda12b-1f6a-42f8-833a-7e3684e774db-1
01:09:39.556 --> 01:09:40.810
second picture is.

21a9f800-84a8-4fe1-8159-90bee6e49185-0
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:46.703
I don't know. It's sort of a
triangle thing with what looks

21a9f800-84a8-4fe1-8159-90bee6e49185-1
01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:51.254
like maybe plates inside. And
then the third picture is a it's

21a9f800-84a8-4fe1-8159-90bee6e49185-2
01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:55.660
like a hat hanging on a hook
alongside something else that's

21a9f800-84a8-4fe1-8159-90bee6e49185-3
01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:00.138
hanging next to it. Might be a
jacket. It's hard to tell. And

21a9f800-84a8-4fe1-8159-90bee6e49185-4
01:10:00.138 --> 01:10:02.450
then the next picture is a bowl.

a9df8f4e-92b6-42a1-9565-c05999641300-0
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:07.936
Look like. I mean it kind of
looks like tails coming out of

a9df8f4e-92b6-42a1-9565-c05999641300-1
01:10:07.936 --> 01:10:11.800
it. I don't know exactly what
that is. And then the next

a9df8f4e-92b6-42a1-9565-c05999641300-2
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.205
picture is pieces of paper with
hand drawn pictures on them. One

a9df8f4e-92b6-42a1-9565-c05999641300-3
01:10:16.205 --> 01:10:20.204
of the pictures is a ship with
smoke coming out of it. The

a9df8f4e-92b6-42a1-9565-c05999641300-4
01:10:20.204 --> 01:10:21.560
other ones got like.

41ce4137-60c3-40f5-aaf8-967aa7902dec-0
01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.750
Sort of doodles with sunshines
on them.

6eb79745-4a2d-499a-8607-1bd4f2a63fa5-0
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:29.300
And then the next picture is.

435e6290-9624-4a3f-a366-ad66328a574a-0
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.210
I don't know.

8234f215-775c-4723-8381-228c6c500fde-0
01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.890
I don't know what that is
exactly.

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-0
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.606
Tea pot, maybe? And then we go
on to a cup of tea or coffee on

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-1
01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:48.083
top of a paper, and then we've
got a picture of what looks like

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-2
01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:52.699
a family, three people. And then
we have a hand and it has a coin

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-3
01:10:52.699 --> 01:10:56.686
in it and it's giving it to
another hand. So there's one

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-4
01:10:56.686 --> 01:11:00.533
hand on top with the coin and
another hand underneath,

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-5
01:11:00.533 --> 01:11:04.380
probably from a different
person, that they're handing

9d87daf7-2bdf-4c9c-a424-26c91df5acca-6
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.359
them the coin.

9c30b4ef-bb76-4dbb-bb12-1bbd323abab3-0
01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.540
{Move on to the next page.}

bb9a4b65-cd6e-4c95-af57-f1f5e3dd45e6-0
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:17.883
And now we see a family sitting
at a table. OK, so now we see a

bb9a4b65-cd6e-4c95-af57-f1f5e3dd45e6-1
01:11:17.883 --> 01:11:22.770
little bit more of the picture
because we see the hand that's

bb9a4b65-cd6e-4c95-af57-f1f5e3dd45e6-2
01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:27.893
giving the coin and he's giving
it to a child. That animal thing

bb9a4b65-cd6e-4c95-af57-f1f5e3dd45e6-3
01:11:27.893 --> 01:11:32.542
is there too, and looks like
they're eating some sort of a

bb9a4b65-cd6e-4c95-af57-f1f5e3dd45e6-4
01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:36.720
meal or drinking some tea or
something at the table.

8c34e71b-456f-49f2-b913-ea2094f6bba9-0
01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.880
The man is holding up three
fingers.

5c6a2563-d4f1-4691-8b3a-0e5620f36842-0
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.690
And giving the.

763ba675-e8a0-47b9-bfd9-64cfe862ef51-0
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.210
Girl the coin. In the
background, we see the drawings

763ba675-e8a0-47b9-bfd9-64cfe862ef51-1
01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:53.820
that we saw earlier and they're
up on the wall. We also see the

763ba675-e8a0-47b9-bfd9-64cfe862ef51-2
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.854
family photo up on the up on a
shelf. It's kind of like

763ba675-e8a0-47b9-bfd9-64cfe862ef51-3
01:11:57.854 --> 01:12:02.465
everything came together in this
picture, like everything we've

763ba675-e8a0-47b9-bfd9-64cfe862ef51-4
01:12:02.465 --> 01:12:06.859
kind of been seeing throughout
is coming together, even like

763ba675-e8a0-47b9-bfd9-64cfe862ef51-5
01:12:06.859 --> 01:12:10.749
some of the flower shapes and
things are on the wall.

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-0
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:17.672
And the hat is hanging there, a
lot. It looks like it's a rag

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-1
01:12:17.672 --> 01:12:21.658
next to it. It's not a jacket,
it's a rag. But yeah, it's kind

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-2
01:12:21.658 --> 01:12:25.328
of like all together in this
scene. Everything that we've

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-3
01:12:25.328 --> 01:12:29.377
seen throughout is now together
in this. And it's come together

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-4
01:12:29.377 --> 01:12:33.236
as a scene. And then the next
picture is somebody putting on

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-5
01:12:33.236 --> 01:12:37.033
rubber boots, and then the
animal is giving them something,

be7abd17-b326-4975-a3de-197809cf83e1-6
01:12:37.033 --> 01:12:40.070
oh hats, and then the girl is
putting on a hat.

cf604fbf-969d-4837-bf59-8af52acb51a1-0
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:46.838
She's got her rubber boots and
her animal and they are going

cf604fbf-969d-4837-bf59-8af52acb51a1-1
01:12:46.838 --> 01:12:47.530
outside.

85589fd2-fc11-42c5-8032-47d7088c727e-0
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.120
And she's pointing to something
on the ground, and then she's

85589fd2-fc11-42c5-8032-47d7088c727e-1
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.876
like got her hand lifted and
there's like a light above it,

85589fd2-fc11-42c5-8032-47d7088c727e-2
01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:59.570
kind of like almost like magic
right there. #END_arrival_6

bba048df-4a5f-44db-8ec7-c003c74c33a5-0
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:04.660
And we can go on to the next
page and that's it.

8ff5c473-264a-4d4c-a1b0-0dbfdc7232d1-0
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.710
Oh, I think you're muted again.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.160
Let me see what's.

f8683e42-b021-4428-9ec6-9aed9709e281-0
01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.940
Next.

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:20.040
OK, next is.

92d127ab-ff4c-42f6-8173-00f21b2559e6-0
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.210
A complex scene.

89973745-d52b-448a-8d96-2d5fd93bfead-0
01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:41.590
Oh, let me.

84c7b3a7-9c78-4c6a-b4db-213eb0a59d11-0
01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:44.150
Make sure I share this
correctly.

01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.840
OK.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:59.380
And you see it.

2553ab12-bf44-4651-b31f-5d3be45ed0ce-0
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:03.905
OK so this is just a complex
scene, so like before 3 to 5

2553ab12-bf44-4651-b31f-5d3be45ed0ce-1
01:14:03.905 --> 01:14:06.300
minutes to describe what you see
in the scene.

5fc46ab3-4c7f-43c9-b244-e474a9cdf36d-0
01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.220
#START_unfriendly_giants OK,
alright, so it says the

5fc46ab3-4c7f-43c9-b244-e474a9cdf36d-1
01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:16.016
unfriendly giants. So there's a
whole bunch of giants on this

5fc46ab3-4c7f-43c9-b244-e474a9cdf36d-2
01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:17.100
page. There's.

ed4236be-c319-4c12-be78-4699f2832de8-0
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:24.030
123456 of them playing chess
with what looks like people

ed4236be-c319-4c12-be78-4699f2832de8-1
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:29.617
they're using as their like
chess pieces and then there's

ed4236be-c319-4c12-be78-4699f2832de8-2
01:14:29.617 --> 01:14:31.640
they're kind of like.

0f22c441-2e0b-431c-919d-4a9bd3242b1b-0
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:37.605
Pushing some people away. Some
of the other ones have big giant

0f22c441-2e0b-431c-919d-4a9bd3242b1b-1
01:14:37.605 --> 01:14:39.260
straws, and they're.

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-0
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:43.952
Like sucking up some water and
then spitting it out on the

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-1
01:14:43.952 --> 01:14:48.142
people. So the people are look
little, but I think it's just

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-2
01:14:48.142 --> 01:14:52.607
because, you know, the the other
things here are giants and then

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-3
01:14:52.607 --> 01:14:56.659
the people are like trying to
hurt the giants. They've got

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-4
01:14:56.659 --> 01:15:00.506
like a big hammer thing and
they're all like holding it

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-5
01:15:00.506 --> 01:15:04.833
together and trying to hit the
giant doesn't seem to really be

e958bfe2-4ae8-4dd9-b6f6-2718200063cc-6
01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.070
doing a whole lot.

4ecfee4f-a4d7-4949-b323-7db8ebe29dfe-0
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.797
And then there's people at their
house. They're all standing

4ecfee4f-a4d7-4949-b323-7db8ebe29dfe-1
01:15:11.797 --> 01:15:16.007
outside of their house and on
top of the roof. And then one of

4ecfee4f-a4d7-4949-b323-7db8ebe29dfe-2
01:15:16.007 --> 01:15:20.218
the Giants has a big rope and
like he's going to drag it along

4ecfee4f-a4d7-4949-b323-7db8ebe29dfe-3
01:15:20.218 --> 01:15:24.095
with him. And then there's
another giant in the middle of

4ecfee4f-a4d7-4949-b323-7db8ebe29dfe-4
01:15:24.095 --> 01:15:27.370
the screen and he's just got
people on his belt.

3b16de83-e566-4d63-adf7-75be467856d9-0
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.119
And he's just walking. And then
we've got a lady giant and a man

3b16de83-e566-4d63-adf7-75be467856d9-1
01:15:32.119 --> 01:15:35.986
giant and a man who looks like
he's coming over to kiss her.

3b16de83-e566-4d63-adf7-75be467856d9-2
01:15:35.986 --> 01:15:40.042
There's another lady giant and a
man giant on the other side of

3b16de83-e566-4d63-adf7-75be467856d9-3
01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:43.909
the screen. So we've got like,
little hearts above the men's

3b16de83-e566-4d63-adf7-75be467856d9-4
01:15:43.909 --> 01:15:47.585
head. So they're like, in love
with these women. And he's

3b16de83-e566-4d63-adf7-75be467856d9-5
01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:48.790
giving her flowers.

abbcdbca-93c8-43d1-bfd5-9c74bf480d8b-0
01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.766
We've got in the background
there's another man and woman,

abbcdbca-93c8-43d1-bfd5-9c74bf480d8b-1
01:15:54.766 --> 01:15:58.956
giants. There's a big giant.
He's got a tree, like he's using

abbcdbca-93c8-43d1-bfd5-9c74bf480d8b-2
01:15:58.956 --> 01:16:03.213
it almost like a broom. So he's
like tore it out of the ground

abbcdbca-93c8-43d1-bfd5-9c74bf480d8b-3
01:16:03.213 --> 01:16:07.672
and put it upside down. And he's
like sweeping some of the people

abbcdbca-93c8-43d1-bfd5-9c74bf480d8b-4
01:16:07.672 --> 01:16:11.794
away. We've got, yeah, a couple
of them have people on their

abbcdbca-93c8-43d1-bfd5-9c74bf480d8b-5
01:16:11.794 --> 01:16:12.200
belts.

8172d87c-26f8-4e19-b616-3142fe9f5cac-0
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:16.370
There's another giant and
there's a big.

a whole bunch of little people
coming out of it and there's a

cab49206-c5fe-4e61-8137-5ab4497ab862-2
01:16:26.158 --> 01:16:30.952
giant that's behind it, a couple
of giants that are going towards

cab49206-c5fe-4e61-8137-5ab4497ab862-3
01:16:30.952 --> 01:16:31.170
it.

cea6de9f-7ec8-4452-82ce-a8c2f9b62120-0
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:37.207
There's a windmill and a giant
that's like spinning the

cea6de9f-7ec8-4452-82ce-a8c2f9b62120-1
01:16:37.207 --> 01:16:37.810
windmill.

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:49.626
There's another windmill on the
other side, so the Giants are

54f9b5ac-b74c-4ddf-990d-81d877a2ba84-1
01:16:49.626 --> 01:16:51.310

Kind of hurting the people in
the process.

763424a6-e916-4191-ae15-505ce421a6d8-0
01:16:56.270 --> 01:17:00.775

Forgetting this isn't 50 way
though I didn't know I could do

3de224e3-a4a7-4158-a8cc-31a9ee2f04d2-1
01:18:02.682 --> 01:18:06.495
it like this before. We've had
the problem with sharing screen

3de224e3-a4a7-4158-a8cc-31a9ee2f04d2-2
01:18:06.495 --> 01:18:07.040

All right, there are people
everywhere, like people on top

e29b425a-be32-45bc-8f55-3e02db0ebc70-2
01:18:25.348 --> 01:18:30.400
of people on top of people. They
are at. It looks like some sort

e29b425a-be32-45bc-8f55-3e02db0ebc70-3
01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.800
of an art gallery.

66d3b7d4-2873-4be6-b3a9-5ac99e56d50f-0
01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:37.453
So there's pictures on the wall.
Some of them are taking the

66d3b7d4-2873-4be6-b3a9-5ac99e56d50f-1
01:18:37.453 --> 01:18:41.949

ladder with a board in between,
and they're trying to take some

66d3b7d4-2873-4be6-b3a9-5ac99e56d50f-3
01:18:46.517 --> 01:18:50.727
of the pictures down. Maybe
they're stealing them. There's

66d3b7d4-2873-4be6-b3a9-5ac99e56d50f-4
01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:54.795
somebody from above that's
trying to get it from the one

66d3b7d4-2873-4be6-b3a9-5ac99e56d50f-5
01:18:54.795 --> 01:18:56.580
that's down on the board.

af0a0ab4-62cb-4540-8448-fc0db5e6a9f7-0
01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.180
Umm.

5fde68eb-c546-4928-ba26-90d021e35b7e-0
01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.600

people in blue, maybe police
officers coming in on the other

8bebf1ef-2404-4b5e-89ad-597c16bbe422-2
01:19:11.316 --> 01:19:15.883
side. Let's see if there's more
pictures, there's more. There's

8bebf1ef-2404-4b5e-89ad-597c16bbe422-3
01:19:15.883 --> 01:19:19.950
people on the stairs that are
like carrying pictures and

8bebf1ef-2404-4b5e-89ad-597c16bbe422-4

And then we're so if we move

424cbfad-ea2e-4b17-8f73-dcca6f89c613-1
01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:31.740
platform and a third platform.
And on the second platform

424cbfad-ea2e-4b17-8f73-dcca6f89c613-2

01:19:36.312 --> 01:19:40.673
many people that that shouldn't
be on ladders. And then we've

424cbfad-ea2e-4b17-8f73-dcca6f89c613-4
01:19:40.673 --> 01:19:44.683

There's some people dressed up
in costumes. I'm seeing like an

183820f3-80af-434e-8afc-78ded8d34b41-2

And then we go upstairs again
and we're going up the stairs

170dcabe-dd7f-49f0-8efd-a20127838a8f-1
01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.630

01:20:35.912 --> 01:20:39.226
third floor. It doesn't look
like they're trying to get the

e36a2ea2-6be6-4639-acba-2e5aefe99341-3
01:20:39.226 --> 01:20:42.540

01:21:45.449 --> 01:21:49.500

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:53.417

well. There are people both

catch a person, there's some

b8c7a22a-fdf6-4c98-9939-7525d5dddfa1-1
01:22:16.085 --> 01:22:19.680

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.735
And then if we go above the sea,
we've got a bunch of people in

c0f73796-c642-4321-b504-e542fed2d50c-1
01:22:41.735 --> 01:22:42.110

We've got some fishermen on
another rock. We have some

448f776b-1763-4159-950a-58165c89287e-1
01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:56.820

b6e0bbe1-df51-42f3-ad33-0bab618c87b1-0
01:22:57.530 --> 01:23:01.072
Like almost like a rainbow of
fish. They're like jumping over

b6e0bbe1-df51-42f3-ad33-0bab618c87b1-1
01:23:01.072 --> 01:23:04.785

cbecad2c-80db-42dc-99fd-b9e606c83bbf-0
01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:10.621
Can't tell that's part of the
rock or if that's actually a

cbecad2c-80db-42dc-99fd-b9e606c83bbf-1
01:23:10.621 --> 01:23:13.995

open and there's people in a

cbecad2c-80db-42dc-99fd-b9e606c83bbf-2
01:23:13.995 --> 01:23:17.315
boat right there. I'm thinking
it's part of the rock though.

cbecad2c-80db-42dc-99fd-b9e606c83bbf-3
01:23:17.315 --> 01:23:19.220
