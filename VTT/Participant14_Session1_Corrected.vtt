10ffc4be-4200-4c72-9670-85ece6b66559-0
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.975
OK, so with graphic novels you
will be asked to look at a

10ffc4be-4200-4c72-9670-85ece6b66559-1
00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:12.381
series of pictures that tell a
story. Imagine you were telling

10ffc4be-4200-4c72-9670-85ece6b66559-2
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:16.856
the story to someone who cannot
see the pictures. Describe what

10ffc4be-4200-4c72-9670-85ece6b66559-3
00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:21.191
you see and what is happening as
you go through the story and

10ffc4be-4200-4c72-9670-85ece6b66559-4
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:22.729
then your first story.

944f3bdc-0dcd-4972-8e88-3120c02f0e0b-0
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.180
Is.

34e02455-de0c-4fb1-bcb1-b9e19676d115-0
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:45.220


ca341c5a-7033-44b9-912d-8987507dc16a-0
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.550
8 slides long.

12beb438-60f1-4e79-a28b-98f29efeb5f0-0
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.670
OK.

dda46804-2e29-4ea3-9098-8326397d1e35-0
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.962
So just describe what you see
and then when you're done

dda46804-2e29-4ea3-9098-8326397d1e35-1
00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.550
describing each page.

6c1d3cbf-4f16-4044-b556-fc3abb3098cb-0
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.826
#START_arrival_4 OK, sure. All
right, so the story begins with

6c1d3cbf-4f16-4044-b556-fc3abb3098cb-1
00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:20.205
a man who looks to be in his 30s
or early 40s, shirtless, and

6c1d3cbf-4f16-4044-b556-fc3abb3098cb-2
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:24.804
something that resembles a
shower. And there's water

6c1d3cbf-4f16-4044-b556-fc3abb3098cb-3
00:01:24.804 --> 00:01:29.490
pouring down on him. After that,
he goes to his sink.

f9a8a971-9205-474d-afe2-1a0ede4bf77a-0
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.630
And begins to.

1d9265cf-55d9-4eb9-b683-193f6f45fad1-0
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.720
He has.

e0777d24-72ff-4661-8ee1-8edba9582fdb-0
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.403
Shaving cream on his face and it
looks as if he's using something

e0777d24-72ff-4661-8ee1-8edba9582fdb-1
00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:45.093
like a razor to shave his face.
Then he begins to get dressed.

e0777d24-72ff-4661-8ee1-8edba9582fdb-2
00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:49.560
He's wearing a button down
collared shirt over top of which

e0777d24-72ff-4661-8ee1-8edba9582fdb-3
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.399
is a vest and we see a close up
of his hands buttoning the vest.

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-0
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.850
From there the next panel is
that he's leaning over and we

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-1
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.825
see his hands tying his
shoelace. He's wearing, you

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-2
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:08.488
know, nice looking shoes. It's
kind of hard to tell from the

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-3
00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:13.457
screen what style they are, but
the kind of style that you would

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-4
00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:18.197
wear if you were wearing a a
button down suit. The next scene

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-5
00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:23.166
is he's holding what looks to be
a bill like a current like form

8490affb-9606-4dfe-9a64-b0e0ebafbc06-6
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:26.530
of currency. I can't tell the
denomination.

adcaeb2d-1931-4377-950f-96ca27eabb4f-0
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.244
On top of that there are some
coins, so it looks as if he's

adcaeb2d-1931-4377-950f-96ca27eabb4f-1
00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:33.989
counting the money that he has
on him at the moment. Then the

adcaeb2d-1931-4377-950f-96ca27eabb4f-2
00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.553
next scene is he is grabbing his
hat off of some kind of a

adcaeb2d-1931-4377-950f-96ca27eabb4f-3
00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.876
platform of some kind, like
maybe a ledge or a desk or

adcaeb2d-1931-4377-950f-96ca27eabb4f-4
00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:44.380
something, and we just see his
hand taking hold of a hat.

268b256f-a4a9-4dde-9b16-bd148547f10a-0
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.684
The next scene is a close-up
image of a map. We see streets,

268b256f-a4a9-4dde-9b16-bd148547f10a-1
00:02:50.684 --> 00:02:56.261
uh little small squares that are
not identified that are probably

268b256f-a4a9-4dde-9b16-bd148547f10a-2
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:59.980
buildings. You know, at some
point there's.

4023e609-8c30-48e4-9fd3-dadd0a5f2401-0
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
There's like a.

9c0376a5-1ee9-4ffc-b837-573b7689d580-0
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.714
You know, side avenue that
connects to a circle, you know,

9c0376a5-1ee9-4ffc-b837-573b7689d580-1
00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:12.350
so some kind of like maybe a
roundabout of some kind in this

9c0376a5-1ee9-4ffc-b837-573b7689d580-2
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.730
town.

02bf67de-ac6c-41fc-925b-60656a9109a4-0
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.740
After that, we see him holding
the map. It's a trifold map and

02bf67de-ac6c-41fc-925b-60656a9109a4-1
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.522
it's sort of, you know, partway
bent in the middle. So he's

02bf67de-ac6c-41fc-925b-60656a9109a4-2
00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:25.429
looking it over. And then the
next scene after that is seeing

02bf67de-ac6c-41fc-925b-60656a9109a4-3
00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:26.690
him from a distance.

0dcad723-5353-4daf-936b-d6b93cf67e5d-0
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.330
So we have a full body view of
him looking at the map.

4cfe1711-3652-4b46-9a56-18e9417fc365-0
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.329
And there's some kind of a
creature at his feet and you

4cfe1711-3652-4b46-9a56-18e9417fc365-1
00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.838
know, it's kind of the a cross
between a cat and a mouse and

4cfe1711-3652-4b46-9a56-18e9417fc365-2
00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:45.125
with some kind of a snake
tongue. And it's it's just kind

4cfe1711-3652-4b46-9a56-18e9417fc365-3
00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:49.634
of like looking up at him, sort
of just possibly waiting for

4cfe1711-3652-4b46-9a56-18e9417fc365-4
00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:49.930
him.

a416e55c-f54c-410e-85ea-351ae8d73ddb-0
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.379
The next scene is him just
walking down the sidewalk.

a416e55c-f54c-410e-85ea-351ae8d73ddb-1
00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.673
There's some other people in
view. This creature is following

a416e55c-f54c-410e-85ea-351ae8d73ddb-2
00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:02.967
behind him. It's got a really
long tail. This is some kind of

a416e55c-f54c-410e-85ea-351ae8d73ddb-3
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:06.914
a fantasy creature. This
creature does not exist in real

a416e55c-f54c-410e-85ea-351ae8d73ddb-4
00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:11.416
life. So I guess we'll find out
more about this world that we're

a416e55c-f54c-410e-85ea-351ae8d73ddb-5
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.810
in. You know, as the story
progresses, the next.

e49a610f-7fe8-437c-ada8-b267a310c3f2-0
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.620
So now we begin to see sort of
a.

7e095ca2-8f8d-491b-b32a-875a7edca277-0
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.098
A broader view of the town or
the city that they're in, and it

7e095ca2-8f8d-491b-b32a-875a7edca277-1
00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:33.048
definitely does seem sort of a,
you know, futuristic, futuristic

7e095ca2-8f8d-491b-b32a-875a7edca277-2
00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:37.237
landscape with conical
buildings, clouds in the middle

7e095ca2-8f8d-491b-b32a-875a7edca277-3
00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:42.188
of the landscape, much lower to
the ground than they would be in

7e095ca2-8f8d-491b-b32a-875a7edca277-4
00:04:42.188 --> 00:04:42.950
real life.

8b20e153-ae0d-4b85-a305-7c01207917b6-0
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.496
In the next scene we see um,
also the close up of a map, but

8b20e153-ae0d-4b85-a305-7c01207917b6-1
00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:54.724
it looks slightly different with
the language up at the top that

8b20e153-ae0d-4b85-a305-7c01207917b6-2
00:04:54.724 --> 00:04:57.620
doesn't exist in real in real
life.

fdbecc09-9d58-41a8-9c79-02c1722cbbaf-0
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.310
Then we see.

a5c59f15-b310-4f34-904f-b9bf99466ac7-0
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.871
We see once again the man
looking at the map. Um, he's we

a5c59f15-b310-4f34-904f-b9bf99466ac7-1
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.626
can see his face sort of more
clearly. For the first time,

a5c59f15-b310-4f34-904f-b9bf99466ac7-2
00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:11.254
he's squinting at the map. I
think maybe looks like he's

a5c59f15-b310-4f34-904f-b9bf99466ac7-3
00:05:11.254 --> 00:05:15.137
trying to find something. Seen
after that is he's once again

a5c59f15-b310-4f34-904f-b9bf99466ac7-4
00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:18.701
looking at the map and this
creature, this kind of like

a5c59f15-b310-4f34-904f-b9bf99466ac7-5
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.020
half.

98f509ba-d492-4127-a41a-f0d1b1635fac-0
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.270
Mouse.

0704bb10-b29a-4487-afad-f81ce3a48776-0
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.240
Lizard creature is still waiting
for him.

bcc57163-8b39-4754-83b4-55668b6b1f2a-0
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.310
And then after that we see once
again a sort of.

b8961272-be8e-4fa0-a0db-1cba1cc02a1e-0
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.450


93c47a4b-92e6-4ff7-a657-9e4fc0d1cc1a-0
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.819
A A scene, you know, like the
scene of the actual city that

93c47a4b-92e6-4ff7-a657-9e4fc0d1cc1a-1
00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:42.180
he's in, and there are airships
and an aqueduct.

516a85c4-5a9f-4451-9d8e-691ef4aebe3a-0
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.381
Sort of in the background and in
the foreground where he's

516a85c4-5a9f-4451-9d8e-691ef4aebe3a-1
00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:53.252
standing are these conical
teepee like structures that are

516a85c4-5a9f-4451-9d8e-691ef4aebe3a-2
00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:58.618
there amongst the sidewalk with
a lot of people, sort of fantasy

516a85c4-5a9f-4451-9d8e-691ef4aebe3a-3
00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:03.985
creatures and at least one thing
that looks like a robot. If and

516a85c4-5a9f-4451-9d8e-691ef4aebe3a-4
00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:09.021
if not a robot, then some kind
of parking meter or something

516a85c4-5a9f-4451-9d8e-691ef4aebe3a-5
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:13.479
that one of the other characters
is interacting with.

ccf310e3-6833-4414-a818-eea57d02dfa4-0
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.248
But, you know, seems for sure
confirmed that we are definitely

ccf310e3-6833-4414-a818-eea57d02dfa4-1
00:06:18.248 --> 00:06:20.630
in some kind of science fiction.

9cf2d282-f532-4e66-a230-17ace9285208-0
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.080
Um world.

c04f5713-0140-4134-b59a-a1363adb0d1a-0
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.728
OK, so from here we see the
creature that we've seen before,

c04f5713-0140-4134-b59a-a1363adb0d1a-1
00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:36.110
the mouse snake creature. I'll
just call it a.

b7ad8e42-c71f-4663-8858-d34cb4a89495-0
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.976
Um, yeah, like the mouse snake
creature is interacting with

b7ad8e42-c71f-4663-8858-d34cb4a89495-1
00:06:40.976 --> 00:06:45.309
something that looks like a a
rabbit owl creature, and the two

b7ad8e42-c71f-4663-8858-d34cb4a89495-2
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:49.435
are just hanging out. The man
that's looking at the map now

b7ad8e42-c71f-4663-8858-d34cb4a89495-3
00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:53.424
looks over at the woman who
seems to be the companion for

b7ad8e42-c71f-4663-8858-d34cb4a89495-4
00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:53.699
the.

ce0bedf2-be2a-45db-9b66-74596d13bd4c-0
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.032
Bunny owl creature. And now he
begins to interact with her. She

ce0bedf2-be2a-45db-9b66-74596d13bd4c-1
00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:03.284
is reading a book and he is
looking over the map. He holds

ce0bedf2-be2a-45db-9b66-74596d13bd4c-2
00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:07.608
his hand up like a gesture of
kind of like can you help me?

ce0bedf2-be2a-45db-9b66-74596d13bd4c-3
00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:09.770
And then he shows her the map.

45047ac0-848a-4a95-94ce-7397ac2e62af-0
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.300
And she begins to point at
something on the map.

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-0
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.470
So we see her pointing at the
map. She's wearing a ring on her

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-1
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.910
pointer finger. And then she
gestures over to the the machine

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-2
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.062
that I kind of thought was a
parking meter before, and it

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-3
00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:32.287
seems to be some kind of a
telephone. She's gesturing over

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-4
00:07:32.287 --> 00:07:36.440
at it. And so now we see the
machine that she's gesturing

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-5
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.807
towards has a Rotary dial and
some other kind of elements to

3e690dd2-a556-4a22-a3ee-2d4bd25cc059-6
00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:44.029
it that you could potentially
interact with.

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-0
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.379
The next scene is her putting
her finger into the Rotary dial

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-1
00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:53.880
and probably like turning it to
to turn. You know, she's she's

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-2
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.167
inputting data of some kind by
interacting with this Rotary

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-3
00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:02.454
dial or or possibly just pushing
buttons on it. After that,

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-4
00:08:02.454 --> 00:08:06.669
there's a crank on the side of
the machine, and we see her

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-5
00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.884
grabbing hold of the crank,
probably to crank it, and then

2e6a3ccc-4005-48da-999a-5690949df09f-6
00:08:10.884 --> 00:08:14.600
after that she's reaching her
hand down underneath.

b8cca08d-cd76-43a4-bd34-889eba8786ee-0
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.070
What's this

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-0
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.998
This horn looking thing that's
coming out of the machine, she's

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-1
00:08:21.998 --> 00:08:26.197
holding her hand underneath it
because being dispensed from

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-2
00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:30.325
from that tube is something is
it looks like maybe a small

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-3
00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:34.874
sheet of paper or you know, some
kind of a card or something. So

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-4
00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:39.352
now she's holding that card up
to the man and she's pointing at

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-5
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:43.901
the card as if to tell him like
this is information or something

628cca9c-41d2-4f03-8285-882769676c93-6
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:47.610
on this card is what you need.
Now she's handing it.

824ebcab-2a24-4414-95ce-6c4b0d46547f-0
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.742
Over to the man. We see his hand
held open, waiting to receive

824ebcab-2a24-4414-95ce-6c4b0d46547f-1
00:08:51.742 --> 00:08:52.320
the card.

795ef7c0-6c15-49ff-805d-32e5cde93c5d-0
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.840
And.

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-0
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.467
In the scene after that, there,
the man and the woman are sort

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-1
00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:02.322
of both leaning towards each
other a little bit as she begins

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-2
00:09:02.322 --> 00:09:05.928
to describe something else to
him. She's holding up three

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-3
00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:09.845
fingers as if to describe, you
know, that three is going to be

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-4
00:09:09.845 --> 00:09:13.513
an important number of some
kind, or possibly the letter W

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-5
00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:17.431
she's also holding something in
her hand, which is hard to see

0084e06f-a2dd-4bb7-9dfd-0e207a5c8147-6
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.540
at this point, but maybe some
kind of a receiver.

48348ffe-39b9-46cc-956a-28b8ee05b17d-0
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.382
The next scene is once again as
sort of like overall shot of

48348ffe-39b9-46cc-956a-28b8ee05b17d-1
00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:30.645
what's going on. In this scene,
we see just many people kind of

48348ffe-39b9-46cc-956a-28b8ee05b17d-2
00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:34.708
pointing up towards the air
where these sailing vessels are.

48348ffe-39b9-46cc-956a-28b8ee05b17d-3
00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:38.837
I mean, they are airships, but
they also just look like boats

48348ffe-39b9-46cc-956a-28b8ee05b17d-4
00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.170
floating in the sky.

203cf93a-d080-4fe0-9842-65eefc4d152d-0
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.425
And the woman who was helping
that man is pointing up towards

203cf93a-d080-4fe0-9842-65eefc4d152d-1
00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:49.379
one of them, and he's holding on
to his hat as he probably

203cf93a-d080-4fe0-9842-65eefc4d152d-2
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:53.534
Shields his eyes from the sun as
he is looking up towards the

203cf93a-d080-4fe0-9842-65eefc4d152d-3
00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:53.869
boat.

bef7ff7d-91c8-4d6f-b129-cc5e4bc89fe5-0
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.589
In the next scene we just see
the silhouettes of people who

bef7ff7d-91c8-4d6f-b129-cc5e4bc89fe5-1
00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:02.378
are just kind of waiting, I
think probably for this airship

bef7ff7d-91c8-4d6f-b129-cc5e4bc89fe5-2
00:10:02.378 --> 00:10:03.010
to arrive.

94889367-16a3-42e0-afc9-155b4a1edda0-0
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.482
And in the next scene, the
airship is coming down and we

94889367-16a3-42e0-afc9-155b4a1edda0-1
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:08.010
can see.

669cd9e1-525b-4453-8572-2d407040f9f0-0
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.500
More clearly that it's actually
just going to land in front of

669cd9e1-525b-4453-8572-2d407040f9f0-1
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.340
them and the next scene verifies
that the the the airship is on

669cd9e1-525b-4453-8572-2d407040f9f0-2
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.220
the ground and everyone is
waiting to to board.

b845092e-a743-4097-bb69-53803ef11721-0
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.834
Now we see the fate, the feet
and legs of the man going up a

b845092e-a743-4097-bb69-53803ef11721-1
00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:30.715
plank with his mouse snake
companion going up there with

b845092e-a743-4097-bb69-53803ef11721-2
00:10:30.715 --> 00:10:35.853
him. Then we see that I guess
it's a ticket. So we now know

b845092e-a743-4097-bb69-53803ef11721-3
00:10:35.853 --> 00:10:40.906
it's a ticket being checked in
by somebody who's wearing a

b845092e-a743-4097-bb69-53803ef11721-4
00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:45.873
uniform that looks like he's
probably an official for the

b845092e-a743-4097-bb69-53803ef11721-5
00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:50.070
vessel that just landed. So his
ticket was just.

cc4b5d20-ff6f-4c4b-902c-b58363b7faaf-0
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.403
Checked off by the
transportation official who's in

cc4b5d20-ff6f-4c4b-902c-b58363b7faaf-1
00:10:56.403 --> 00:10:58.510
charge of this airship.

73b654c6-9216-46fa-8d31-e300950c1fa7-0
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.160
At least the ticketing for the
airship.

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-0
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.678
So in the next scene, the man
finds a place to sit, and it

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-1
00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:12.917
looks like he found like a a
wooden bench, and his mouse

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-2
00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:17.678
snake companion comes up next to
him and sits down next to him.

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-3
00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:22.289
Next to the man is the woman
from earlier, and she has a seat

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-4
00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:26.826
next to him with her Bunny owl
companion sitting on her lap.

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-5
00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:31.438
And she's she's gesturing. She
looks like she's talking about

cc30f60e-8aed-46ac-b9b5-553deefe5bd4-6
00:11:31.438 --> 00:11:34.190
something. The man, we see him
next.

72e6c300-366a-4c29-9c74-df80ff04a5d1-0
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.889
Holding up both hands as if to
say that he's uncertain about

72e6c300-366a-4c29-9c74-df80ff04a5d1-1
00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:43.670
something, and then he's leaning
forward, gesturing with one hand

72e6c300-366a-4c29-9c74-df80ff04a5d1-2
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.871
and holding his chest with
another. You know he's looking

72e6c300-366a-4c29-9c74-df80ff04a5d1-3
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:52.146
apologetic. Possibly he, you
know, once again just doesn't

72e6c300-366a-4c29-9c74-df80ff04a5d1-4
00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:56.420
understand something or is
trying to find more information

72e6c300-366a-4c29-9c74-df80ff04a5d1-5
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.710
and.

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-0
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.856
Is is asking for additional
help. Then he holds open his

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-1
00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:07.615
jacket and starts to reach
inside for something. The next

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-2
00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:12.456
scene we see him holding a
document of some kind. It looks

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-3
00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:17.625
like there's a photo on it and
and maybe some official stamps.

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-4
00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:22.138
The woman. Now we see her
clutching her chest with one

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-5
00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:27.143
hand as if to say oh I'm so
sorry. And she's leaning forward

ce1c82cb-35b4-4325-9d12-fe4d4e8849a6-6
00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:28.210
and her face.

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-0
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.737
Looks sympathetic. Her animal
companion is behind her, just

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-1
00:12:32.737 --> 00:12:37.344
looking on at this point. Now
she reaches into her bag and is

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-2
00:12:37.344 --> 00:12:41.951
pulling something out, and she
also pulls out a document very

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-3
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:46.706
similar to the one he had, and
she's holding that up for him to

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-4
00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:51.238
see. And once again, it's a
document with a photograph on it

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-5
00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:56.142
and with some official markings,
and we see, it's the images of a

45a900e6-57ac-430e-aa83-994c7c5ff9f3-6
00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.520
young woman. And so then we see.

3deb259c-105a-49e6-be89-bc711089cc08-0
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.659
A close up of the the face of
the person that's on her

3deb259c-105a-49e6-be89-bc711089cc08-1
00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:06.970
document and it's it's a person
who's younger than she is,

3deb259c-105a-49e6-be89-bc711089cc08-2
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.843
possibly related to her or
possibly she herself as a

3deb259c-105a-49e6-be89-bc711089cc08-3
00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:11.940
younger person.

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-0
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.951
Next we go to a set of images
which are different in color. So

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-1
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:22.237
before, all of these were black
and white images that had a

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-2
00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:26.167
sepia tone. And now the
following images are black and

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-3
00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:30.668
white images that have more of a
Gray, Gray tone. You know, so

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-4
00:13:30.668 --> 00:13:34.526
all of this is going to imply
that we're looking at a

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-5
00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:38.956
different scene, possibly at a
different period of time. This

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-6
00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:43.171
could be a flashback. So what's
happening now is the young

f1ef9cbb-51bf-43d1-a193-c2f725864dcc-7
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:43.600
woman.

90e42f7d-da15-442e-a627-90d6fc08a0f6-0
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.530
Was reading a book.

fcdb6a4f-d10f-439f-a253-461a942d4190-0
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.200
And then she's.

241aa746-dddb-428c-b089-58ac52ee949d-0
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.991
She looks incredibly scared and
is clutching her book as two

241aa746-dddb-428c-b089-58ac52ee949d-1
00:13:54.991 --> 00:14:00.395
hands enter the scene and begin
to grab her. Her face looks like

241aa746-dddb-428c-b089-58ac52ee949d-2
00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:05.633
she's terrified and the hands
belong to obviously a man is the

241aa746-dddb-428c-b089-58ac52ee949d-3
00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:10.870
way that they're they're drawn,
has to look much older and and

241aa746-dddb-428c-b089-58ac52ee949d-4
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.030
you know, they are holding on to
her.

c44f51f7-5a1b-420d-913d-8ecc34cda516-0
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:20.752
And the next scene, those same
hands that had grabbed her are

c44f51f7-5a1b-420d-913d-8ecc34cda516-1
00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:25.765
now storing the book in some
kind of a drawer. And then after

c44f51f7-5a1b-420d-913d-8ecc34cda516-2
00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:30.698
that, that same drawer is now
being padlocked by those hands

c44f51f7-5a1b-420d-913d-8ecc34cda516-3
00:14:30.698 --> 00:14:34.660
and then the the man brings is
holding a shovel.

3f67c38a-41e7-49eb-9b4d-8fb6ad3b79a8-0
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.380
With one hand and clutching her
arm in the other hand.

b224ba39-9c22-40aa-a789-03b6e894d9dc-0
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.080
From there we see that he's.

c8ed1c71-4d9b-4f99-a6f2-103a4523af9b-0
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.701
We now see that, you know, it's
actually her. He's holding on to

c8ed1c71-4d9b-4f99-a6f2-103a4523af9b-1
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:53.140
her shoulder with one hand. Now
she has the shovel as he's

c8ed1c71-4d9b-4f99-a6f2-103a4523af9b-2
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.881
directing her attention towards
something that he wants her to

c8ed1c71-4d9b-4f99-a6f2-103a4523af9b-3
00:14:57.881 --> 00:15:02.396
be doing with that shovel. So
he's kind of pointing towards

c8ed1c71-4d9b-4f99-a6f2-103a4523af9b-4
00:15:02.396 --> 00:15:07.137
the ground a little bit. Next we
see her shoveling coal into a

c8ed1c71-4d9b-4f99-a6f2-103a4523af9b-5
00:15:07.137 --> 00:15:08.040
furnace, so.

0f4dddfc-dae1-45da-b487-bb0d46cbd221-0
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.970
The the furnace is part of some
kind of.

a5a5e76e-8d00-459f-bea9-445fc80410a3-0
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.477
We we actually don't really see
what this furnace is attached

a5a5e76e-8d00-459f-bea9-445fc80410a3-1
00:15:16.477 --> 00:15:19.194
to. We just see that she's
shoveling something into the

a5a5e76e-8d00-459f-bea9-445fc80410a3-2
00:15:19.194 --> 00:15:20.310
furnace, probably coal.

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-0
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.034
The next scene, she's still
doing that same work, but now

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-1
00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:28.842
it's raining. And the next
scene, she's doing that same

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-2
00:15:28.842 --> 00:15:32.854
work now, except that there's
snow on the ground and she's

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-3
00:15:32.854 --> 00:15:37.002
still out there. Finally we see
that, you know, she's, she's

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-4
00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:41.354
there with the shovel, and she's
meant to be probably shoveling

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-5
00:15:41.354 --> 00:15:45.230
coal into the furnace, but
there's a lot of smoke coming

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-6
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.174
directly out of the furnace
where the fire is meant to be

ed2f08c1-949b-4042-91fd-3a013d5d0235-7
00:15:49.174 --> 00:15:49.650
stoked.

d85bfe16-13b9-489b-9f9f-dd049de49084-0
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.084
And so to investigate why the
smoke is coming out the front of

d85bfe16-13b9-489b-9f9f-dd049de49084-1
00:15:55.084 --> 00:15:55.860
the furnace.

8d8e0067-276c-45aa-967d-e05ad357deb8-0
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:02.371
The next scene we see her on a
ladder with a chimney like a the

8d8e0067-276c-45aa-967d-e05ad357deb8-1
00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:06.580
kind of a brush that a chimney
sweep would use.

a94ee279-7fcd-4faf-a135-25bfcf4ca238-0
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.455
So she's taking that up the
ladder towards the chimney of

a94ee279-7fcd-4faf-a135-25bfcf4ca238-1
00:16:11.455 --> 00:16:16.000
the furnace, and then we see her
at the top of the chimney using

a94ee279-7fcd-4faf-a135-25bfcf4ca238-2
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.770
that brush.

56c1e69f-b367-49cd-9820-5a77b76221e7-0
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.090
Down the down the smokestack so
that she can clean it out.

47f4fe06-d8f5-48a5-8b9b-8b4c19f5cbac-0
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.300
And in the following scene we
see.

c49c9943-10cf-49db-a0ed-8bf960d7e0ba-0
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.420
We see a.

2379c3ea-6e5b-4558-9080-58e6a8e9810a-0
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.870
The.

d314a54a-9b7c-4a79-8c5b-1c2d0e3d2b25-0
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.207
We see the view of what she
sees, you know. So when she's at

d314a54a-9b7c-4a79-8c5b-1c2d0e3d2b25-1
00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:48.525
the very top of the chimney,
she's looking out on this scene

d314a54a-9b7c-4a79-8c5b-1c2d0e3d2b25-2
00:16:48.525 --> 00:16:51.640
that looks like she's in the
middle of the.

f8c0b299-00f2-4ace-81e6-556198bd503a-0
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.730
This.

4b906da9-28d0-46a8-b11a-019a1f827708-0
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.380
Circular building that has.

48e41084-089c-42fd-888f-77f52362de51-0
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:04.728
Dozens of these furnaces that
are have all been cordoned off,

48e41084-089c-42fd-888f-77f52362de51-1
00:17:04.728 --> 00:17:10.184
so each one of these furnaces
has somebody assigned to work

48e41084-089c-42fd-888f-77f52362de51-2
00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:15.914
it, and their whole world are
these individual cells that have

48e41084-089c-42fd-888f-77f52362de51-3
00:17:15.914 --> 00:17:17.459
nothing but coal.

d7de6e06-c35e-4c30-ad0b-0708867037b8-0
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.980
And a furnace and all of these
people are sort of just destined

d7de6e06-c35e-4c30-ad0b-0708867037b8-1
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.270
to.

e7cc20d4-ba4f-406c-9132-8cf0d653aee5-0
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.500
To just work their particular
furnace.

cab6078b-9f56-4dcf-9700-22c026218e94-0
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.110
Umm.

bca0076d-2401-406b-b470-62dea615ad5f-0
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.220
And the next scene we see that
she's.

9d355d4f-d18a-4d5f-babc-032fd23aeec9-0
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.890
Kind of like crouched down,
feeling despair, holding her

9d355d4f-d18a-4d5f-babc-032fd23aeec9-1
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.450
head in her hands.

15daf8aa-4b58-4102-a0a4-b59113265a09-0
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.780
And then

602bdc39-5f69-41c3-8888-7f1f8e33caaa-0
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.026
And then we see her standing up
and she's holding her shovel and

602bdc39-5f69-41c3-8888-7f1f8e33caaa-1
00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:55.812
looking at the door of the cell
that she's in. Then she uses the

602bdc39-5f69-41c3-8888-7f1f8e33caaa-2
00:17:55.812 --> 00:17:59.199
shovel to Jimmy the door away
from its hinge.

07492446-67d9-4e99-a703-326c36160aab-0
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.080
So that it looks as if she's
breaking the door down.

4018d7cd-fa93-4fb0-88e4-0961b9c9be9b-0
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.772
It's hard to say what's
happening in the very next

4018d7cd-fa93-4fb0-88e4-0961b9c9be9b-1
00:18:07.772 --> 00:18:11.916
scene, because the image is kind
of partway cut off, but it looks

4018d7cd-fa93-4fb0-88e4-0961b9c9be9b-2
00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:15.808
as if she's she's looking around
the side of the door just to

4018d7cd-fa93-4fb0-88e4-0961b9c9be9b-3
00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:18.760
make sure that there's no one
nearby, perhaps.

e146aa18-d7df-424c-8492-3b0c9e303925-0
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.770
And then she.

8df0c83f-a71b-4bdb-938d-841af640275a-0
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.090
She is um.

e1642a42-9e67-4753-b5ed-ba4bfd0c4179-0
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.386
Looking in a drawer, I think, or
looking in a place where

e1642a42-9e67-4753-b5ed-ba4bfd0c4179-1
00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:35.477
possibly the same cabinet or the
same drawer that the book had

e1642a42-9e67-4753-b5ed-ba4bfd0c4179-2
00:18:35.477 --> 00:18:36.690
been stored in.

912353b6-c772-4da5-98be-7056095bfcb9-0
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.800
And so she finds it.

0af82a65-ea7a-4a90-8cd7-ccded5f8e54f-0
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.715
She opens the drawer, and so we
see her hands reaching inside

0af82a65-ea7a-4a90-8cd7-ccded5f8e54f-1
00:18:43.715 --> 00:18:47.360
the drawer and clutching and
taking hold of the book.

40f21823-f635-4883-837c-54b1a8c3ad69-0
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:53.429
That had been taken from her
from earlier, and the next scene

40f21823-f635-4883-837c-54b1a8c3ad69-1
00:18:53.429 --> 00:18:58.796
we see her clutching the book to
her chest as we as she run like

40f21823-f635-4883-837c-54b1a8c3ad69-2
00:18:58.796 --> 00:18:59.870
hastens away.

50bab538-110d-460d-807f-19d897998f32-0
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.150
And then we see this like.

bc2128df-099b-4f87-9ca6-9c3c6ebad40a-0
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:08.209
Overview of what the what the
area looks like. It almost looks

bc2128df-099b-4f87-9ca6-9c3c6ebad40a-1
00:19:08.209 --> 00:19:12.102
as if it's a train station.
There's some train tracks nearby

bc2128df-099b-4f87-9ca6-9c3c6ebad40a-2
00:19:12.102 --> 00:19:14.080
and she's running towards them.

43587782-c732-463e-845f-8ed755781c87-0
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.620
She she gets on board of.

f836d696-5069-4851-a07f-52b56b6c7054-0
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:26.742
She she does, she gets on, she
climbs inside one of the box

f836d696-5069-4851-a07f-52b56b6c7054-1
00:19:26.742 --> 00:19:32.872
cars on the train and she, she
now crouches inside of the the

f836d696-5069-4851-a07f-52b56b6c7054-2
00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:39.299
Boxcar and she's looking outside
and then in the very next scene

f836d696-5069-4851-a07f-52b56b6c7054-3
00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:40.979
we see the train.

459ad39c-ac69-41ea-9c91-5dfc61a16a34-0
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:49.580
It's so it's a it's a steam
engine and we see the locomotive

459ad39c-ac69-41ea-9c91-5dfc61a16a34-1
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:55.656
sort of coming around the corner
of a bend with probably about,

459ad39c-ac69-41ea-9c91-5dfc61a16a34-2
00:19:55.656 --> 00:19:58.220
you know, 5678 at least 10.

e3efebcd-d64b-4fb4-affb-8054aea600ce-0
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.370
Cars that it's pulling behind
it.

92549b70-1063-4e49-b98e-0c25e6f18d1f-0
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:07.860
OK.

a59615b9-0363-434a-ae7d-a2f6cb6b71ab-0
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.830
Next we have this overview shot
of an airship.

4b2a8eca-f34f-407c-a5e6-d362dc34fb65-0
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.552
We see a little bit more of the
city with a lot of of the

4b2a8eca-f34f-407c-a5e6-d362dc34fb65-1
00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:20.856
billboards and things,
advertising products and a

4b2a8eca-f34f-407c-a5e6-d362dc34fb65-2
00:20:20.856 --> 00:20:24.491
language that doesn't really
exist. A woman is holding

4b2a8eca-f34f-407c-a5e6-d362dc34fb65-3
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:28.390
something that looks like coffee
or some hot beverage and.

0da618a9-0cbe-4cf9-a488-aeec894c441a-0
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.463
You know, it's, it's just, it's
very much a sort of a blend of a

0da618a9-0cbe-4cf9-a488-aeec894c441a-1
00:20:34.463 --> 00:20:35.550
futuristic slash.

e82402ad-0bf9-4f49-becc-db87d94c1ab9-0
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.840
Asian inspired slash Moroccan
inspired cityscape.

a2c4df5f-8d5d-431c-b849-afdea3ae9dc4-0
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.310
With something that looks like a
minaret in the background, so

a2c4df5f-8d5d-431c-b849-afdea3ae9dc4-1
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.440
like sort of a mosque, but not
really.

f00e06e7-ccf2-4c0a-ae39-b201b203acc7-0
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.200
And then we return to the same
sepia tones here. So this is

f00e06e7-ccf2-4c0a-ae39-b201b203acc7-1
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.233
likely modern day, where we see
the woman once again holding on

f00e06e7-ccf2-4c0a-ae39-b201b203acc7-2
00:20:57.233 --> 00:21:01.202
to her rabbit owl companion in
her lap, and the man is sitting

f00e06e7-ccf2-4c0a-ae39-b201b203acc7-3
00:21:01.202 --> 00:21:04.920
next to her, looking at where
she is, gesturing, and she's

f00e06e7-ccf2-4c0a-ae39-b201b203acc7-4
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.630
pointing to something off in the
distance.

4b7cdbec-9235-4b09-a113-44f39c27aa3b-0
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.433
Then we see some somebody, some
man who looks like he's wearing

4b7cdbec-9235-4b09-a113-44f39c27aa3b-1
00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:17.708
some official uniform of some
kind, holding a megaphone up to

4b7cdbec-9235-4b09-a113-44f39c27aa3b-2
00:21:17.708 --> 00:21:21.570
his mouth. So he's making some
kind of an announcement.

9e1e442a-2797-4521-b4e1-06816cf2e0c3-0
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.550
Then we see the ship.

e0df5215-e564-45b7-b39e-5a3d3a65d6ef-0
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.413
Sort of hovering above what
looks to be another kind of a

e0df5215-e564-45b7-b39e-5a3d3a65d6ef-1
00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:34.437
platform where additional
passengers are waiting possibly

e0df5215-e564-45b7-b39e-5a3d3a65d6ef-2
00:21:34.437 --> 00:21:36.380
for the arrival of the ship.

75e52810-5eb7-484c-a9cf-798afb4b26f2-0
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.445
And so it seems that we've come
to the end of whatever part of

75e52810-5eb7-484c-a9cf-798afb4b26f2-1
00:21:42.445 --> 00:21:47.525
this journey he we are, we are
at. We see the man in the hat

75e52810-5eb7-484c-a9cf-798afb4b26f2-2
00:21:47.525 --> 00:21:52.771
saying farewell to the woman.
They're holding hands or shaking

75e52810-5eb7-484c-a9cf-798afb4b26f2-3
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:57.684
hands. And then he begins to
walk down the platform and he

75e52810-5eb7-484c-a9cf-798afb4b26f2-4
00:21:57.684 --> 00:22:02.846
has his mouse snake companion
with him. And then he's looking

75e52810-5eb7-484c-a9cf-798afb4b26f2-5
00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:07.509
upwards towards the sky, sort of
uncertain because his.

7a8adde4-62f6-4a2d-a2d8-0cca6ebecfa3-0
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:14.070
His brow is furrowed and he has
his hand sort of tapped onto his

7a8adde4-62f6-4a2d-a2d8-0cca6ebecfa3-1
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:18.692
chin, sort of as he's in
thought, looking up at what he's

7a8adde4-62f6-4a2d-a2d8-0cca6ebecfa3-2
00:22:18.692 --> 00:22:19.250
saying.

e720558e-b729-41c2-9df9-e11f0efe3c2d-0
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.358
And then in the next scene we
see what he is saying, which is

e720558e-b729-41c2-9df9-e11f0efe3c2d-1
00:22:24.358 --> 00:22:24.700
this.

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-0
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.607
You know, really kind of
confusing landscape where

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-1
00:22:30.607 --> 00:22:35.976
there's this giant statue of a
creature that kind of looks like

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-2
00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:40.337
a squirrel but not really,
holding a bowl of items,

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-3
00:22:40.337 --> 00:22:44.867
possibly food items with
additional food items at its

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-4
00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:49.900
feet. But this is a giant statue
since surrounded by it are

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-5
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.681
buildings and you can see how
enormous this the squirrel

91408ffa-032c-430e-8273-9de6cc2d88ec-6
00:22:54.681 --> 00:22:55.520
statue is.

077f7bb1-c1c5-4db9-95d4-8724a9534cb8-0
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.693
By comparison to the people and
the buildings that surround it,

077f7bb1-c1c5-4db9-95d4-8724a9534cb8-1
00:22:59.693 --> 00:23:03.283
and it looks almost like a
labyrinth in the way that he

077f7bb1-c1c5-4db9-95d4-8724a9534cb8-2
00:23:03.283 --> 00:23:07.130
would have to approach the
middle of this part of the city.

a78b437a-e8ca-4585-8bd8-2ba9602abda5-0
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.725
So it's possible that he was
wondering where he should be

a78b437a-e8ca-4585-8bd8-2ba9602abda5-1
00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:12.400
going next.

1cd668bc-3f5f-40cc-9c22-7e1a28eee6ad-0
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.021
So he begins to to walk and we
just see him walking down the

1cd668bc-3f5f-40cc-9c22-7e1a28eee6ad-1
00:23:19.021 --> 00:23:23.544
sidewalk and there's a wall kind
of behind him with indescript,

1cd668bc-3f5f-40cc-9c22-7e1a28eee6ad-2
00:23:23.544 --> 00:23:27.785
you know, just like bricks or
messages behind him. And then

1cd668bc-3f5f-40cc-9c22-7e1a28eee6ad-3
00:23:27.785 --> 00:23:31.814
from there we see that, you
know, he's just in a part of

1cd668bc-3f5f-40cc-9c22-7e1a28eee6ad-4
00:23:31.814 --> 00:23:34.500
town, you know, there's other
people.

8b27aa05-c950-4949-b031-7a55eff90ea1-0
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.679
You know, playing sidewalk
games, interacting with each

8b27aa05-c950-4949-b031-7a55eff90ea1-1
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:41.130
other, just walking around.

a907c365-47ef-412a-9522-0d4b08126418-0
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.586
And then we see two, two men
interacting with each other kind

a907c365-47ef-412a-9522-0d4b08126418-1
00:23:46.586 --> 00:23:50.553
of near a box of squid arms. So
possibly some kind of a squid

a907c365-47ef-412a-9522-0d4b08126418-2
00:23:50.553 --> 00:23:54.712
arm transaction that's happening
in that scene. In the following

a907c365-47ef-412a-9522-0d4b08126418-3
00:23:54.712 --> 00:23:58.678
scene, there's somebody who's
reaching into what looks like a

a907c365-47ef-412a-9522-0d4b08126418-4
00:23:58.678 --> 00:24:01.430
vending machine and pulling
something out.

e22680bd-5185-4b96-b895-00f6442cbb41-0
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.950
After that, there's a scene
where an older man is looking

e22680bd-5185-4b96-b895-00f6442cbb41-1
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:12.458
inside of a box being held up by
a slightly younger but still old

e22680bd-5185-4b96-b895-00f6442cbb41-2
00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:15.880
man, and inside the box is some
kind of.

aa84c21e-0a88-464c-9e05-9c0bfdee8b0c-0
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.090
A fish lizard of some kind.

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-0
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.237
And then after that, we see that
the man is standing in the

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-1
00:24:25.237 --> 00:24:29.514
middle of the sidewalk. His
Companion of the Mouse Snake is

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-2
00:24:29.514 --> 00:24:34.147
still near him. He's pulling out
a book now, and he's looking at

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-3
00:24:34.147 --> 00:24:38.139
the book, and there's many
images in the book with some

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-4
00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:42.630
script next to each one. So he's
looking at the one that looks

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-5
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.551
like a loaf of bread, and he's
looking at whatever the

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-6
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:50.686
characters are that would
describe what the loaf of bread

6edabb44-6b23-439f-8deb-5953906022f9-7
00:24:50.686 --> 00:24:50.900
is.

7d70bdd5-63b5-41c5-bca2-f2ded201a496-0
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:56.743
And then he looks over to what
seems to be the vending machine

7d70bdd5-63b5-41c5-bca2-f2ded201a496-1
00:24:56.743 --> 00:24:57.790
area and his.

6a738a2f-1a8a-446e-88a7-34fa0ed99211-0
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.580
Mouse Snake companion has
already kind of like identified.

3833c633-cef5-4303-b607-9e823036059a-0
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.797
Which thing he should be
opening, or at least which thing

3833c633-cef5-4303-b607-9e823036059a-1
00:25:08.797 --> 00:25:13.088
that the mouse, the mouse snake
wants. So the man goes over

3833c633-cef5-4303-b607-9e823036059a-2
00:25:13.088 --> 00:25:17.164
there and he pulls open the
drawer, but inside of it are

3833c633-cef5-4303-b607-9e823036059a-3
00:25:17.164 --> 00:25:20.240
they look like just giant rattle
tadpoles.

e623c86e-2c98-4d78-9670-7358fc3fe51a-0
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.224
So then he consults his book
again, and then he pulls out one

e623c86e-2c98-4d78-9670-7358fc3fe51a-1
00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:26.760
of the.

07cf6f78-b8ac-4595-80d2-a8b108d675d1-0
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.830
Strange giant tadpoles um.

06970b78-974b-4fde-a619-1afa58d16551-0
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.090
And.

f9307bfd-4399-4412-82f0-0c2fa2827cb2-0
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.208
Oh, he's not the one that pulls
it out, OK. A hand reaches in

f9307bfd-4399-4412-82f0-0c2fa2827cb2-1
00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:39.090
and pulls out a giant tadpole.

fee3df0a-eee8-4c1d-81ff-149af8d6ecdb-0
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.014
It actually this, this boy,
this, this, this young boy who

fee3df0a-eee8-4c1d-81ff-149af8d6ecdb-1
00:25:45.014 --> 00:25:50.453
pulls one of them out. And then
next to that boy is a slightly

fee3df0a-eee8-4c1d-81ff-149af8d6ecdb-2
00:25:50.453 --> 00:25:55.720
older man wearing suspenders.
And the boy and the man seemed

fee3df0a-eee8-4c1d-81ff-149af8d6ecdb-3
00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.814
very friendly and they were
waving as if to say, here, did

fee3df0a-eee8-4c1d-81ff-149af8d6ecdb-4
00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:06.253
you want this? The man with a
hat gestures No, he does not. He

fee3df0a-eee8-4c1d-81ff-149af8d6ecdb-5
00:26:06.253 --> 00:26:09.879
holds up one hand outwardly and
his face.

ef3adc41-3f28-4223-8d43-11e9fa7360a6-0
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.640
As an expression of, you know,
no I'm.

d0411a32-0cf1-4536-aa28-a0ca4a6968c9-0
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.284
I'm all set, thank you so much.
And instead he actually pulls

d0411a32-0cf1-4536-aa28-a0ca4a6968c9-1
00:26:18.284 --> 00:26:23.128
the book out and he gestures at
the loaf of bread that he was

d0411a32-0cf1-4536-aa28-a0ca4a6968c9-2
00:26:23.128 --> 00:26:27.817
trying to find. This time the
loaf of bread is on the other

d0411a32-0cf1-4536-aa28-a0ca4a6968c9-3
00:26:27.817 --> 00:26:32.817
side of the page. I'm not really
sure that that matters, but in

d0411a32-0cf1-4536-aa28-a0ca4a6968c9-4
00:26:32.817 --> 00:26:37.662
any case, so he points at the
symbol of the loaf of bread and

d0411a32-0cf1-4536-aa28-a0ca4a6968c9-5
00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:39.850
then he uses a hand gesture.

ef9d54c7-707b-4feb-84f2-87113a51e07f-0
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.353
I guess to seem to imply that
that's what he actually wants.

ef9d54c7-707b-4feb-84f2-87113a51e07f-1
00:26:45.353 --> 00:26:49.288
The hand gesture that he's using
is like one, one palm facing up

ef9d54c7-707b-4feb-84f2-87113a51e07f-2
00:26:49.288 --> 00:26:51.649
and the other palm facing
towards him.

f264e16d-1d21-406f-8116-84cb74855629-0
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.250
On top, like a sweeping motion.
That's not a gesture I

f264e16d-1d21-406f-8116-84cb74855629-1
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.083
recognize, but the result is
that the man with the suspenders

f264e16d-1d21-406f-8116-84cb74855629-2
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:03.730
who's friendly and trying to
help, he points to one of the

f264e16d-1d21-406f-8116-84cb74855629-3
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.080
other drawers of the vending
machine.

3a7942bc-c4d8-45e4-a4c3-4ca24bf94cb0-0
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.632
And then he opens that drawer
and he pulls out what looks to

3a7942bc-c4d8-45e4-a4c3-4ca24bf94cb0-1
00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:15.270
be like an eggplant with a
really curled top.

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-0
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.652
And he gives that to the man in
the hat, who looks like he took

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-1
00:27:20.652 --> 00:27:24.760
a bite out of it. So it's
possible that that's just what

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-2
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.300
bread looks like. Then we see
the boy return, and he's holding

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-3
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.057
this large Wicker basket, like a
large shallow Wicker basket. And

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-4
00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:38.165
in the next scene, the man of
the hat is now holding the

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-5
00:27:38.165 --> 00:27:42.561
Wicker basket. The friendly man
with suspenders is gesturing

0d6d304b-1051-4373-b700-58bb53f2054f-6
00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:42.850
for.

3fe690de-7e3f-48db-be8a-f6753e768276-0
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.797
Him to follow along. He wants
the man in the hat to follow

3fe690de-7e3f-48db-be8a-f6753e768276-1
00:27:47.797 --> 00:27:51.697
them. The boy is kind of leading
the way, smiling towards

3fe690de-7e3f-48db-be8a-f6753e768276-2
00:27:51.697 --> 00:27:52.370
somewhere.

0d5ed18c-1307-4a24-9d91-5a048f9b3a3f-0
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.714
And then we see the friendly man
with the suspenders holding up

0d5ed18c-1307-4a24-9d91-5a048f9b3a3f-1
00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:05.430
some kind of oversized shrimp,
maybe.

b20d85a3-ff8f-4aaf-b536-444be7da0ee5-0
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:12.428
And then we see the boy holding
up some kind of geoduck that has

b20d85a3-ff8f-4aaf-b536-444be7da0ee5-1
00:28:12.428 --> 00:28:14.940
that's hollow on one side.

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-0
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.072
And it has like it's
effervescent, there's bubbles

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-1
00:28:20.072 --> 00:28:24.258
coming out of it, and then we
see the man in suspenders

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-2
00:28:24.258 --> 00:28:28.744
leaning over something and
tasting something which we can't

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-3
00:28:28.744 --> 00:28:33.453
really see what it is. In the
foreground it looks like there's

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-4
00:28:33.453 --> 00:28:38.312
some kind of an aloe plant. And
then we see the boy holding what

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-5
00:28:38.312 --> 00:28:42.947
seems to be of very, very, very
large dragon fruit, like just

e56ad8b6-9788-45b0-a4b7-4545875e5fa4-6
00:28:42.947 --> 00:28:43.770
this giant.

197d7304-c891-45ed-a68c-255246e17921-0
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.070
Something, just giant vegetable.

15f454aa-f17d-40ab-a3d8-d2f4cf3a9c55-0
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.514
And then um, and then the man is
holding some kind of a shellfish

15f454aa-f17d-40ab-a3d8-d2f4cf3a9c55-1
00:28:53.514 --> 00:28:55.990
out of which is like several.

b74d91d6-b895-4193-b4a8-fbae867353df-0
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.880
You know, several tentacles are
coming out of it.

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-0
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.758
And then we see the man in
suspenders holding a giant snake

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-1
00:29:04.758 --> 00:29:08.788
like creature with a big bulbous
head. And then we see him

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-2
00:29:08.788 --> 00:29:13.227
holding what looks like a sweet
potato with legs giving a thumbs

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-3
00:29:13.227 --> 00:29:17.189
up gesture. And then we see him
holding what looks like a

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-4
00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:21.492
cucumber that has like a sort of
a star shape on the inside of

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-5
00:29:21.492 --> 00:29:25.727
it. Ohh. And then we see the boy
happily taking a bite out of

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-6
00:29:25.727 --> 00:29:29.688
what looked like that giant
tadpole that he had extracted

33e553fa-a16e-457e-b9b4-7311ae5d252e-7
00:29:29.688 --> 00:29:30.849
from the cabinet.

384401b8-c4b8-43a3-8813-aa7ef95642eb-0
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.530
From earlier.

d6fd1886-8d82-403f-b960-a050633cc695-0
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.626
So now we see the man in the hat
kind of taking a bite and

d6fd1886-8d82-403f-b960-a050633cc695-1
00:29:37.626 --> 00:29:42.410
holding food in his mouth,
looking with curiosity at the.

b95eb102-d5ff-4206-a146-fa2a3c3fb8e9-0
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.490
Cucumber that had a sort of a
star shape on the inside of it.

eda9f6e9-66d7-4957-bc86-82d2111e3e15-0
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.444
And then we see the boy leaning
over and feeding something to

eda9f6e9-66d7-4957-bc86-82d2111e3e15-1
00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:57.080
the mouse snake companion.

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-0
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.265
All right, so now the man with
the hat's basket is full of all

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-1
00:30:03.265 --> 00:30:07.690
sorts of different kinds of
strange foods that he's taking

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-2
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.115
home with them. The boy is
whispering something to the man

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-3
00:30:12.115 --> 00:30:16.840
with the suspenders, who I think
at this point we can probably

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-4
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.190
presume is his father and the
the man with the suspenders

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-5
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.990
leans in to the man wearing the
hat and and embraces him warmly

36346f5f-afa1-4c85-82d1-925e0df2fdb8-6
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.590
with a hand on his shoulder and
leans into him.

c5f72605-7543-44db-8aa6-8d5ebb8077b9-0
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.360
As the boy points towards.

59c6831c-ef73-4651-9561-4a13068e7929-0
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:38.943
What looks to be a boat like a a
few boats, but maybe in a harbor

59c6831c-ef73-4651-9561-4a13068e7929-1
00:30:38.943 --> 00:30:39.880
of some kind.

442b864f-9a69-4c26-ae49-4d5f350554dd-0
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.697
In the next scene, we see them
all walking out to the harbor

442b864f-9a69-4c26-ae49-4d5f350554dd-1
00:30:44.697 --> 00:30:46.010
together. Except that.

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-0
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.560
There's there's no water here.
It's either incredibly low tide

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-1
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.244
or these boats don't require
water to move because everything

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-2
00:30:56.244 --> 00:31:01.155
is shored and the the boats are
moored to these parts of the the

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-3
00:31:01.155 --> 00:31:06.142
land but there's no water coming
in. And in the background we see

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-4
00:31:06.142 --> 00:31:10.600
you know some kind of like
spectacular series of buildings

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-5
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.511
that almost look like a Fort or
a castle with all various shapes

70cc9e6a-99f0-4a2b-aaa6-1d6283593633-6
00:31:15.511 --> 00:31:17.400
and mostly triangles and.

5f29f4e7-307c-4eb4-b64d-261d82cdea58-0
00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.450
and circles and arches.

6cb53835-d76b-42c9-a691-529fa009f828-0
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.150
Coming out of it, like a giant
sandcastle.

f72a7942-4cc3-4b8d-9cd3-988421e6deb5-0
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:33.570
So they continue walking towards
one of the small row boats.

57725886-c608-4d0b-95b1-c0fc344783bf-0
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:38.590
And then the boy gestures over
as he's holding some kind of

57725886-c608-4d0b-95b1-c0fc344783bf-1
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:42.650
like a pot in front of him. The
pot was on the bow of the

57725886-c608-4d0b-95b1-c0fc344783bf-2
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.920
rowboat, and the man with the
hat peers into the pot, out of

57725886-c608-4d0b-95b1-c0fc344783bf-3
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.330
which is a tentacle very slowly
raising its way out. And then.

8a0a86b8-ccce-4aed-87ef-5a62a0deecbd-0
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.855
In the next scene, the tentacle
is most of the way out, actually

8a0a86b8-ccce-4aed-87ef-5a62a0deecbd-1
00:31:56.855 --> 00:32:01.470
looks like about 2 feet worth of
tentacle coming out of this pot

8a0a86b8-ccce-4aed-87ef-5a62a0deecbd-2
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:06.015
and the man with the hat drops
his basket of strange food items

8a0a86b8-ccce-4aed-87ef-5a62a0deecbd-3
00:32:06.015 --> 00:32:10.204
and looks quite shocked and
upset to see this tentacle and

8a0a86b8-ccce-4aed-87ef-5a62a0deecbd-4
00:32:10.204 --> 00:32:14.393
the boy clutching his mouth as
if to say oh whoops, I'm so

8a0a86b8-ccce-4aed-87ef-5a62a0deecbd-5
00:32:14.393 --> 00:32:14.820
sorry.

a6d2ce12-8a87-43a8-b954-3e3bb45224af-0
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.271
The man with the suspenders is
laughing and kind of gesturing

a6d2ce12-8a87-43a8-b954-3e3bb45224af-1
00:32:21.271 --> 00:32:26.563
towards the tentacle, and the
man with the hat now is leaning

a6d2ce12-8a87-43a8-b954-3e3bb45224af-2
00:32:26.563 --> 00:32:31.769
in with curiosity, holding his
chin with one of his hands, I

a6d2ce12-8a87-43a8-b954-3e3bb45224af-3
00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:37.146
think with caution as he looks
on. Then we see the boy holding

a6d2ce12-8a87-43a8-b954-3e3bb45224af-4
00:32:37.146 --> 00:32:41.670
what looks to be, you know, some
kind of a a rodent.

4cd97932-bb72-45a9-8499-eb732d404bc5-0
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:50.820
Slash Dragon creature the rodent
dragon creature is.

f310ac32-7408-44a7-af8f-382cb1cda299-0
00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:57.231
Pretty obviously this child's
companion. Then we see a sort of

f310ac32-7408-44a7-af8f-382cb1cda299-1
00:32:57.231 --> 00:33:02.210
like a close up on the rodent
fox like face and then the the

f310ac32-7408-44a7-af8f-382cb1cda299-2
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.190
man takes a.

6a18571a-60dc-48a3-a263-4d09571c3f90-0
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:10.579
Actually looks like he's petting
the monster so he's kind of like

6a18571a-60dc-48a3-a263-4d09571c3f90-1
00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:15.473
letting he's he's leaning in and
his hand is over top the the

6a18571a-60dc-48a3-a263-4d09571c3f90-2
00:33:15.473 --> 00:33:19.420
creature's head as the boy holds
it to his chest.

bacfe554-9db5-4b28-be38-217004a7940b-0
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:24.237
And the man with the suspenders
now is crouched down and still

bacfe554-9db5-4b28-be38-217004a7940b-1
00:33:24.237 --> 00:33:27.990
laughing and pointing at
something. And then in the next

bacfe554-9db5-4b28-be38-217004a7940b-2
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.110
scene we see the.

0973ae6c-86c9-46c0-9a9f-09b72c86b53e-0
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.820
Fox.

f13c2aaf-5b3b-47ab-a4ef-ab2780ac296e-0
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.430
Rodent dragon creature
interacting with the mouse

f13c2aaf-5b3b-47ab-a4ef-ab2780ac296e-1
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.400
lizard snake.

d9fa37b8-2612-4a27-bcd8-e0e9171c0d0a-0
00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.791
And in the next scene, the two
of them continue to interact

d9fa37b8-2612-4a27-bcd8-e0e9171c0d0a-1
00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:46.455
with each other, and now the man
with the hat is picking up his

d9fa37b8-2612-4a27-bcd8-e0e9171c0d0a-2
00:33:46.455 --> 00:33:50.244
food and the man with the
suspenders is helping and

d9fa37b8-2612-4a27-bcd8-e0e9171c0d0a-3
00:33:50.244 --> 00:33:54.689
putting it back in the basket.
The man with a hat apologizes

d9fa37b8-2612-4a27-bcd8-e0e9171c0d0a-4
00:33:54.689 --> 00:33:59.061
with his hand on his chest, and
the man with the suspenders

d9fa37b8-2612-4a27-bcd8-e0e9171c0d0a-5
00:33:59.061 --> 00:33:59.790
tells him.

6317b44c-9dd4-4ff0-8748-f7fb044a46a9-0
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.040
You know, in a gesture that says
don't worry about it.

0d8d56bb-bbbf-4135-b8df-e28473148060-0
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.668
Just holding his hand up as if
you know he's he's trying to

0d8d56bb-bbbf-4135-b8df-e28473148060-1
00:34:10.668 --> 00:34:12.770
comfort the man with the hat.

575eb5ad-4459-4f89-be46-379e9425f375-0
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.797
And then after that, we see the
man with the hat gesturing

575eb5ad-4459-4f89-be46-379e9425f375-1
00:34:18.797 --> 00:34:19.510
upwards.

0c508faa-97ec-4ecc-927f-f7db84aec29d-0
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.100
In in maybe some kind of a
confused way.

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-0
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:30.645
Possibly upset. Then we see him
taking out his notebook and he's

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-1
00:34:30.645 --> 00:34:34.941
he's writing something with his
pen or drawing something. In the

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-2
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:39.105
next scene we see that he drew a
series of very simple looking

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-3
00:34:39.105 --> 00:34:43.004
houses side-by-side, like
townhouses. And then over top of

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-4
00:34:43.004 --> 00:34:47.168
that is a long tail going off
off to the side of the page with

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-5
00:34:47.168 --> 00:34:51.398
spikes coming on the tail as if
there was a dragon or something

5406b29a-ad7b-4343-af47-8e1701232e82-6
00:34:51.398 --> 00:34:53.910
that had just flown over these
homes.

caaf2504-4d2e-46d8-b114-365b5b2921e7-0
00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.488
And the man with the suspenders
once again puts in a reassuring

caaf2504-4d2e-46d8-b114-365b5b2921e7-1
00:35:00.488 --> 00:35:05.317
hand on the man with the hats
shoulder as he leans in and

caaf2504-4d2e-46d8-b114-365b5b2921e7-2
00:35:05.317 --> 00:35:10.230
describes what he himself wants
to say in terms of his own

caaf2504-4d2e-46d8-b114-365b5b2921e7-3
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.730
story.

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-0
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:16.528
So he gestures towards himself,
and then he gestures upwards,

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-1
00:35:16.528 --> 00:35:20.738
you know, remembering something
that had happened. The man with

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-2
00:35:20.738 --> 00:35:24.686
the suspenders wears glasses,
and in his glasses we can see

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-3
00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:28.962
something like that's happening
in terms of a flashback. There's

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-4
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:33.304
fire in whatever memory this man
has returned to. And then we see

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-5
00:35:33.304 --> 00:35:37.053
fire in his eyes, you know,
possibly something that he's

35697371-63fb-4967-8aa0-d67f27a322c6-6
00:35:37.053 --> 00:35:38.830
remembering. #END_arrival_4

8996a66f-ff73-4a6c-9d04-31339f7fa483-0
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.000
What a weird story.

59ae5bf0-48f9-411d-ba27-e0276215eccf-0
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.350
And next?

f49d954a-4c8e-4ea0-aeb3-41abbeba6b50-0
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.965
We have a complex scene, so
these ones let me just show you

f49d954a-4c8e-4ea0-aeb3-41abbeba6b50-1
00:35:55.965 --> 00:35:56.330
the.

Directions.

3eca3ed5-7990-4d97-874d-b5657bd5dc8b-0
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.163
OK, so for a complex scene it's
going to be one page and you'll

3eca3ed5-7990-4d97-874d-b5657bd5dc8b-1
00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:08.510
be asked to describe.

be2164c9-5b84-4388-9dec-13fc16e8d8ed-0
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.073
As if you're describing it to
somebody who cannot see the

be2164c9-5b84-4388-9dec-13fc16e8d8ed-1
00:36:12.073 --> 00:36:14.876
picture. Describe what is
happening and what you see in

be2164c9-5b84-4388-9dec-13fc16e8d8ed-2
00:36:14.876 --> 00:36:18.180
the scene, and then to take 3 to
5 minutes to describe the scene.

bfd817d2-f848-41a7-b4a5-2ea126508852-0
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.360
OK. And I will share.

2e81c26e-95d3-49bc-8427-678eade9cfd3-0
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.350
My screen.

f4eff755-9536-4075-8959-ada353298dd9-0
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:39.810
OK.

a1f06452-3add-4db4-81c1-9a35212db626-0
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.800
And I will make this.

d0472d0e-3ddb-470d-a1e5-bacd0b22aa9b-0
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.100
Bigger, OK.

295d150b-bc9d-438f-9ede-5451baf8a765-0
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.283
So begin when you're ready.
#START_being_a_pirate The

295d150b-bc9d-438f-9ede-5451baf8a765-1
00:36:50.283 --> 00:36:54.942
overall picture is of a pirate
ship off of the coast of some

295d150b-bc9d-438f-9ede-5451baf8a765-2
00:36:54.942 --> 00:36:59.142
kind of piece of land, and
there's a caption up in the

295d150b-bc9d-438f-9ede-5451baf8a765-3
00:36:59.142 --> 00:37:04.183
upper left of the two page image
called being a pirate. Shiver me

295d150b-bc9d-438f-9ede-5451baf8a765-4
00:37:04.183 --> 00:37:08.841
Timbers. There's some language
there I can't really read too

295d150b-bc9d-438f-9ede-5451baf8a765-5
00:37:08.841 --> 00:37:10.140
well on a screen.

4052abe7-66b0-4e10-85f2-410f420db980-0
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:16.829
But in the scene itself there is
chaos. There's little images of

4052abe7-66b0-4e10-85f2-410f420db980-1
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:21.984
pirates and boats absolutely
everywhere in this scene. The

4052abe7-66b0-4e10-85f2-410f420db980-2
00:37:21.984 --> 00:37:27.576
main pirate ship itself has at
least 50 if not more individuals

4052abe7-66b0-4e10-85f2-410f420db980-3
00:37:27.576 --> 00:37:32.644
packed onto the deck of the
ship. And everything that you

4052abe7-66b0-4e10-85f2-410f420db980-4
00:37:32.644 --> 00:37:37.799
can imagine happening on a
pirate ship is happening in the

4052abe7-66b0-4e10-85f2-410f420db980-5
00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:41.120
scene. Cannons are going off.
People.

fea6980d-e2be-48a2-b16c-a14473576129-0
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:46.366
are fighting, being pushed off
of the boat, Being clunked on

fea6980d-e2be-48a2-b16c-a14473576129-1
00:37:46.366 --> 00:37:47.130
the head,

017d80af-56a1-4425-a4fc-bd5c50a0ca5d-0
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.732
Going up and down the lines that
are attached to the sails, going

017d80af-56a1-4425-a4fc-bd5c50a0ca5d-1
00:37:53.732 --> 00:37:58.797
up and down the masts. They are
both firing their cannons and

017d80af-56a1-4425-a4fc-bd5c50a0ca5d-2
00:37:58.797 --> 00:38:00.840
also being fired upon in.

1e132d15-8e92-42fd-8830-ab1f3f73b8d6-0
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:06.158
Sort of the area further away
from shore we see a couple of

1e132d15-8e92-42fd-8830-ab1f3f73b8d6-1
00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:10.436
additional larger boats like
larger pirate boats. We see the

1e132d15-8e92-42fd-8830-ab1f3f73b8d6-2
00:38:10.436 --> 00:38:14.784
stern of one of those boats and
then in the background we see

1e132d15-8e92-42fd-8830-ab1f3f73b8d6-3
00:38:14.784 --> 00:38:18.993
like the full-on pirate ship
with like 3 Jolly Rogers being

1e132d15-8e92-42fd-8830-ab1f3f73b8d6-4
00:38:18.993 --> 00:38:22.570
displayed, which is the skull
and cross bone flag.

277b760e-9519-44c9-9e13-7c029df4503e-0
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:28.800
In addition to these main three
ships we see at least.

371b2e01-e054-443c-88ad-f8a08ed3c88b-0
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:36.943
Oh man 12345678910,11,12 at
least a dozen up to 15 dinghies

371b2e01-e054-443c-88ad-f8a08ed3c88b-1
00:38:36.943 --> 00:38:43.187
or row boats, all of which are
packed with once again like at

371b2e01-e054-443c-88ad-f8a08ed3c88b-2
00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:46.310
least a dozen pirates each. So.

dcbd0ba7-7d11-4981-8575-f5f2411c3d8b-0
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.703
Most of them are afloat. Some of
them are fighting sea monsters

dcbd0ba7-7d11-4981-8575-f5f2411c3d8b-1
00:38:51.703 --> 00:38:55.422
like giant Kraken or octopus
that's come out of the water.

dcbd0ba7-7d11-4981-8575-f5f2411c3d8b-2
00:38:55.422 --> 00:38:59.456
One of them has sunk and you see
pirates reaching out for help.

dcbd0ba7-7d11-4981-8575-f5f2411c3d8b-3
00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:03.364
Some of them are going to and
from the ship. Some of them are

dcbd0ba7-7d11-4981-8575-f5f2411c3d8b-4
00:39:03.364 --> 00:39:06.390
going to and from the other
ships in the scene.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:12.589
We see a few people jumping out
of these dinghies into the sea

7910a888-896c-47e8-8c6a-a23425f58240-1
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:16.988
and we see people trying to
climb back into them in other

7910a888-896c-47e8-8c6a-a23425f58240-2
00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:17.520
scenes.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.540
We see.

7951ca70-858d-4471-9bfa-03383b2248cb-0
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.178
We see at least one pirate
trying to walk the plank in one

7951ca70-858d-4471-9bfa-03383b2248cb-1
00:39:26.178 --> 00:39:27.190
of these boats.

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-0
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.339
And then there's everything
that's happening on the shore.

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-1
00:39:33.339 --> 00:39:38.271
So there is some shoreline that
we can see off of to the right

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-2
00:39:38.271 --> 00:39:43.203
side of this image. And on that
we see once again, just like a

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-3
00:39:43.203 --> 00:39:47.901
variety of different scenes.
Some pirates are digging, some

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-4
00:39:47.901 --> 00:39:52.755
pirates have an empty treasure
chest in front of them and are

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-5
00:39:52.755 --> 00:39:57.531
examining it. Some of them are
fighting with each other, and

70e4ca34-1938-42e1-8269-b275a2ea9493-6
00:39:57.531 --> 00:39:59.410
there's some palm trees.

b6cd4c50-4819-485d-bc64-b067103ecd13-0
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.146
They are cutting down the palm
trees and at least one of those

b6cd4c50-4819-485d-bc64-b067103ecd13-1
00:40:04.146 --> 00:40:08.715
scenes further in the background
we see at least one of the row

b6cd4c50-4819-485d-bc64-b067103ecd13-2
00:40:08.715 --> 00:40:12.070
boats or dinghies being pulled
onto the shore.

bd970904-96f0-47f8-987a-d7eaa43d4ab9-0
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.941
Or being dragged back out to
sea, it's hard to say like

bd970904-96f0-47f8-987a-d7eaa43d4ab9-1
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:19.309
what's happening in that
particular scene and I would say

bd970904-96f0-47f8-987a-d7eaa43d4ab9-2
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.890
that that.

92f44592-96b4-45bc-951d-1859b84de31b-0
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.190
Describes what's going on.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.520
OK, perfect.

32e00711-7b8b-438d-b35f-863702d38377-0
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:34.250
Let me put the next one. Let's
see we have another short story.

74066980-9644-4fd5-b5b7-203e5038bcd2-0
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.970
This one is 2 slides.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:56.870
OK.

75dd2919-288f-4825-b328-a6424990a87e-0
00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:58.960
Hello.

ac42a968-1ed4-48cf-8934-a1a961287341-0
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.260
OK. And I will.

2a4d21bf-9ecb-4b3e-9311-32b5fd694d34-0
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.481
You could start when you're
ready. OK, all right.

2a4d21bf-9ecb-4b3e-9311-32b5fd694d34-1
00:41:06.481 --> 00:41:08.920

9fddd647-d865-427e-b19a-8ecb8ec73d3a-0
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.668
Futuristic sci-fi world from
before. In the black and white

9fddd647-d865-427e-b19a-8ecb8ec73d3a-1
00:41:15.668 --> 00:41:20.490
sepia tones, we see what looks
to be a paper boy wearing.

f57d314f-99c7-4ab0-89b5-f073cdcda47e-0
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.559
One of those, I forget what
they're called exactly. The kind

f57d314f-99c7-4ab0-89b5-f073cdcda47e-1
00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:27.330
of like Paperboy newsboy hats.

cc7560a2-e551-48e2-bcab-12cb28ab570c-0
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.271
Holding up what looks to be some
kind of like a big sign, and

cc7560a2-e551-48e2-bcab-12cb28ab570c-1
00:41:33.271 --> 00:41:37.256
holding several other papers
under his arm and just standing

cc7560a2-e551-48e2-bcab-12cb28ab570c-2
00:41:37.256 --> 00:41:40.981
on the sidewalk while people
behind him are reading what

cc7560a2-e551-48e2-bcab-12cb28ab570c-3
00:41:40.981 --> 00:41:44.640
looked to be the newspapers that
he probably sold them.

31ae406c-8c71-4d3b-8293-d51ffec5b2cc-0
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.160
In the next scene we see.

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-0
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.566
a working woman who's holding a
creature of her own in her arms.

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-1
00:41:53.566 --> 00:41:58.497
After that we see a a vendor. He
looks like he has like this push

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-2
00:41:58.497 --> 00:42:03.054
cart of food in front of him. So
like, he's probably this is

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-3
00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:07.612
probably his food stall that
he's pushing around selling hot

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-4
00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:12.543
food. It's got like a chimney in
the middle of the cart and steam

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-5
00:42:12.543 --> 00:42:17.025
is coming out of it. He also has
an animal companion that's

3cebe47a-09e1-4414-a714-336791e2aa6a-6
00:42:17.025 --> 00:42:18.519
riding in the front.

6bba87b5-d211-44ec-beb3-d3818d01091c-0
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:23.979
basket of this cart looking out
ahead. That animal kind of looks

6bba87b5-d211-44ec-beb3-d3818d01091c-1
00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:27.870
like an iguana of some kind. The
next scene or.

6ae10715-249b-47f0-b935-4221588502dc-0
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.450
Kind of a couple looking into a
crate of.

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-0
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.935
What looked like very giant eggs
and he is holding one under his

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-1
00:42:37.935 --> 00:42:42.067
arm and she is examining one
with both of her hands and

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-2
00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:46.642
there's a couple of additional
giant eggs in this crate, look

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-3
00:42:46.642 --> 00:42:50.847
like they're surrounding by
something soft like straw or

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-4
00:42:50.847 --> 00:42:54.906
something. In the next scene we
see what looks to be a

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-5
00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:59.259
professional Barber who has
somebody sitting in a chair in

7439b3a2-aa46-4568-a6c3-db01293b3070-6
00:42:59.259 --> 00:43:03.760
front of him and he is using a
razor to shave that person's.

d69668f2-7408-4a60-a186-b263550649da-0
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:07.747
Face. That person's face is
covered also with shaving cream,

d69668f2-7408-4a60-a186-b263550649da-1
00:43:07.747 --> 00:43:11.644
and in the foreground we have
some kind of mollusk creatures

d69668f2-7408-4a60-a186-b263550649da-2
00:43:11.644 --> 00:43:13.050
that are just kind of.

7788ed2f-994e-4aae-a94d-8737b5613b5f-0
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:19.980
Scampering around on the on the
street in the foreground.

c58313ab-d585-43cb-adfd-1d37ac43dd30-0
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:26.410
In the next scene, we see a
musician playing on the

c58313ab-d585-43cb-adfd-1d37ac43dd30-1
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:32.460
sidewalk. He's got the
combination of a accordion kind

c58313ab-d585-43cb-adfd-1d37ac43dd30-2
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.670
of trumpet.

40201020-738d-4239-b975-70d1e4262e2a-0
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.780
Instrument, some kind of a.

65da192d-084f-4eaa-a5e1-5ef1028f28a7-0
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.780
Yeah, just some kind of a
made-up instrument.

fd4b2f16-5ef2-447f-88b2-d27784b2064c-0
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:45.941
A fictional instrument, and he's
playing that while he's reading

fd4b2f16-5ef2-447f-88b2-d27784b2064c-1
00:43:45.941 --> 00:43:50.225
some sheet music on this, on a
stand that's in front of him, in

fd4b2f16-5ef2-447f-88b2-d27784b2064c-2
00:43:50.225 --> 00:43:53.639
the background, there's
somebody, also a musician,

fd4b2f16-5ef2-447f-88b2-d27784b2064c-3
00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:57.655
playing what looks to be a
violin, and in front of them are

fd4b2f16-5ef2-447f-88b2-d27784b2064c-4
00:43:57.655 --> 00:43:59.530
some kind of like, you know.

adee3d4e-d29e-4644-93a7-13f86e59c7e3-0
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.880
Pigeon. Bird.

32db940e-1aee-4dc7-a106-016d59cc72eb-0
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.360
Bunny hybrid creatures.

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-0
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:10.571
And then after that, there's a
scene where there's a bunch of

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-1
00:44:10.571 --> 00:44:14.637
people sitting side by side with
books or other information in

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-2
00:44:14.637 --> 00:44:18.316
front of them, like maybe a
newspaper. It looks like one

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-3
00:44:18.316 --> 00:44:22.383
woman might be using her hands
on some kind of like a knitting

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-4
00:44:22.383 --> 00:44:25.868
project or something. It's very
difficult to see, but

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-5
00:44:25.868 --> 00:44:29.934
everything's everyone seems to
be looking on towards the woman

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-6
00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:33.936
who's reading out loud. She's
gesturing with her hands, which

88a5f5f5-5e84-4c10-93ec-26a797d421e0-7
00:44:33.936 --> 00:44:36.260
makes it look as if she's
probably.

7a9572cb-321e-4928-a0cb-06a059c44af4-0
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.397
Communicating, and everyone
seems to be, you know, listening

7a9572cb-321e-4928-a0cb-06a059c44af4-1
00:44:39.397 --> 00:44:40.550
to what she has to say.

33570adf-aba0-4b87-91a3-2c8e61e38e3a-0
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.251
And then in the final scene is
the the man who I think we've

33570adf-aba0-4b87-91a3-2c8e61e38e3a-1
00:44:45.251 --> 00:44:49.177
seen before, but this time he
has a suitcase, which I don't

33570adf-aba0-4b87-91a3-2c8e61e38e3a-2
00:44:49.177 --> 00:44:52.972
remember him having before. Or
maybe he did and he's he's

33570adf-aba0-4b87-91a3-2c8e61e38e3a-3
00:44:52.972 --> 00:44:57.159
looking in wonder kind of around
him with his hand on his chin.

1b7efac8-9753-4a81-a519-36eb3b1069cb-0
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.010
As activity is happening in the
background behind him.

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-0
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.725
Then he takes out a device and
and looks at it or opens it up

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-1
00:45:07.725 --> 00:45:11.668
and taps on it. It's possible
that it's some kind of a

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-2
00:45:11.668 --> 00:45:15.683
compass, or maybe it's some kind
of a clock or watch or

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-3
00:45:15.683 --> 00:45:20.128
something. And then he looks
upwards while he's still holding

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-4
00:45:20.128 --> 00:45:24.573
this compact. It's like a you
know, it's like a round item in

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-5
00:45:24.573 --> 00:45:29.305
his hand that he clasped open or
unclasped into an open position.

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-6
00:45:29.305 --> 00:45:34.037
He's looking up at a building at
what looks to be some kind of an

9be38492-4548-491a-8c7f-eaac5f809195-7
00:45:34.037 --> 00:45:34.970
astronomical.

cb78cccd-b633-4ec4-b4b5-be79f7c96865-0
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.899
Clock, so it's possible he's
trying to tell the time by

cb78cccd-b633-4ec4-b4b5-be79f7c96865-1
00:45:38.899 --> 00:45:41.380
looking at whatever device this
is.

dfd155c2-75ae-4cd1-8e8d-514cb44aa25b-0
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.950
It just kind of looks like one
sun in front of another sun.

5a205a59-c76f-4726-b27b-9d1928a163a2-0
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.753
Next we see him with his
suitcase again, and he's like in

5a205a59-c76f-4726-b27b-9d1928a163a2-1
00:45:50.753 --> 00:45:53.520
the middle of the sidewalk
crossing the street.

fd884ab0-3fa5-4266-ac7d-2b12cfb5d6e4-0
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.021
And then we see him in a
different part of town with, you

fd884ab0-3fa5-4266-ac7d-2b12cfb5d6e4-1
00:45:58.021 --> 00:46:01.914
know, person in the background,
and now he's in a section of

fd884ab0-3fa5-4266-ac7d-2b12cfb5d6e4-2
00:46:01.914 --> 00:46:05.680
town that's different, with
archways in the background and

fd884ab0-3fa5-4266-ac7d-2b12cfb5d6e4-3
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.850
he's still carrying his
suitcase.

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-0
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.656
Next we see him looking up at
these, at these glowing orbs

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-1
00:46:13.656 --> 00:46:18.097
sort of that have surrounded
him, and they almost look like

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-2
00:46:18.097 --> 00:46:22.390
fireflies. And we see him sort
of leaning into one that's

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-3
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:26.831
glowing kind of brightly in
front of him, and he reaches up

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-4
00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:31.272
as if to touch it, but then all
of a sudden they all streak

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-5
00:46:31.272 --> 00:46:36.083
away. So before he has a chance
to, I think, know what they are,

5242a676-d957-4a43-9d18-3353218b9e1b-6
00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:36.750
they all.

8a1a2155-7528-4ff1-8fb2-5287fa420e73-0
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:39.640
They all sort of just vanish.

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-0
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.884
And it's it happened so quickly
that he loses his hat. So his

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-1
00:46:44.884 --> 00:46:48.650
hat flies off his head. He
reached down, he reaches down,

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-2
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:52.804
he picks up the hat and he puts
it back on, and then he notices

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-3
00:46:52.804 --> 00:46:57.024
that there was some markings on
the ground where had his hat had

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-4
00:46:57.024 --> 00:47:01.244
fallen. So he's looking down at
the ground, where he sees all of

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-5
00:47:01.244 --> 00:47:05.009
these arrows pointing in
different directions. Some point

3cf7d3d7-ce82-4dea-8665-9ab4a48fd27d-6
00:47:05.009 --> 00:47:08.579
left, some point up, some point
down, some are curved.

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-0
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:13.980
And then he pulls his book back
out. So he's looking at his book

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-1
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.565
and he's cross referencing it
with the designs that he sees on

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-2
00:47:18.565 --> 00:47:22.931
the ground. And as he's doing
this and trying to figure out

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-3
00:47:22.931 --> 00:47:27.297
what it means, another, he looks
over his shoulder upwards.

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-4
00:47:27.297 --> 00:47:31.809
Somebody has approached him from
behind. And then we see that

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-5
00:47:31.809 --> 00:47:36.321
there's this man's hand that
he's looking at. And then in the

bc82da74-49b2-4cc8-b540-f80b8fb9f224-6
00:47:36.321 --> 00:47:39.160
next scene we see the man
himself. So.

93c252d1-ae1e-4c00-bfd2-c1c27bd6f935-0
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.252
A man who would is dressed as if
he, you know lives in, you know,

93c252d1-ae1e-4c00-bfd2-c1c27bd6f935-1
00:47:44.252 --> 00:47:48.923
Egypt or another part of the
Middle East or something to make

93c252d1-ae1e-4c00-bfd2-c1c27bd6f935-2
00:47:48.923 --> 00:47:53.745
a modern day sort of analog to
whatever he's wearing. He's sort

93c252d1-ae1e-4c00-bfd2-c1c27bd6f935-3
00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:58.492
of gesturing towards the the man
on with the hat as if to ask,

93c252d1-ae1e-4c00-bfd2-c1c27bd6f935-4
00:47:58.492 --> 00:48:02.711
you know, can I help you? Is
there anything that you're

93c252d1-ae1e-4c00-bfd2-c1c27bd6f935-5
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:05.650
looking for? And the man with
the hat.

17bc46f2-c315-48e8-aa9d-899645c180c4-0
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:12.310
And the the the the local, I
guess the local start to

17bc46f2-c315-48e8-aa9d-899645c180c4-1
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:17.420
interact with each other. The
local then gestures.

3bb2603b-74d9-414d-98c4-bb9f107a0063-0
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.136
And towards the man again,
possibly as if, you know, he's

3bb2603b-74d9-414d-98c4-bb9f107a0063-1
00:48:23.136 --> 00:48:27.346
trying to say, you know, I'm, I
want to help you, I just don't

3bb2603b-74d9-414d-98c4-bb9f107a0063-2
00:48:27.346 --> 00:48:31.556
know what you need. So the man
with the hat takes his notebook

3bb2603b-74d9-414d-98c4-bb9f107a0063-3
00:48:31.556 --> 00:48:35.700
back out again and starts to
draw. The local looks on as he's

3bb2603b-74d9-414d-98c4-bb9f107a0063-4
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.440
drawing. The man with a hat
draws a bed.

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-0
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.965
A bed with a window in the
background, so like he's looking

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-1
00:48:43.965 --> 00:48:48.277
for a bedroom and the the local
raises his finger and his eyes

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-2
00:48:48.277 --> 00:48:52.588
go a little wider and looks to
smile a little bit as if to say

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-3
00:48:52.588 --> 00:48:56.625
ohh right, yes I know what you
need. And then he starts to

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-4
00:48:56.625 --> 00:49:01.073
gesture away from the spot where
they are. So the man with a hat

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-5
00:49:01.073 --> 00:49:05.111
taking his suitcase back in
hand, follows the local who is

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-6
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:09.559
carrying his own companion in a
sort of a pack on his back which

cd199572-d1f8-4140-9247-592af8661e5b-7
00:49:09.559 --> 00:49:09.970
looks.

3c1b45e2-3b70-4b3c-b9ce-7e197b9886c8-0
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.520
Like some kind of

f6afbae2-776b-46c8-91c5-978b678b0d3d-0
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.270
A rabbit squirrel.

45da45b9-4b35-4f6d-a31b-ab340fc59e23-0
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.960
Creature. #END_arrival_3

0d46ed82-a81c-4e94-8c08-20ab91cc989b-0
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.910
Hey if you need to take like a.

57f6bc15-b345-41a2-8aa3-8a9f59864212-0
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:33.843
2 to 3 minute break. Get any
water? I don't know. OK, I'm

57f6bc15-b345-41a2-8aa3-8a9f59864212-1
00:49:33.843 --> 00:49:36.070
good. You got it? I got it.

e66b925e-4e07-4404-98df-fa2ad6c0267a-0
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.670
Now next, let me see what we
have. We have a complex scene.

d79e813c-aa9a-48a0-8288-bc81b740f6af-0
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.520
And I'm going to pull it up.

4f812e93-4211-4053-b2de-23f95db04ef6-0
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.420
Yep.

02872329-d3b9-4805-aec9-a90b7c21fb1a-0
00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:00.709
OK, like before, take 3 to 5
minutes, describe the scene and

02872329-d3b9-4805-aec9-a90b7c21fb1a-1
00:50:00.709 --> 00:50:01.700
I will share.

7223e0c6-a7c4-4cef-8245-3dd22ad31f7a-0
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.470
My screen and put this in a
presenting mode.

597098b2-0d01-4dfa-b2ae-0b6b6b05d9db-0
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:12.870
#START_campsite OK. All right.
So in this scene we've got.

428ff13e-2ad7-420b-8ca2-a1f91c181f0b-0
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:20.213
Once again, like utter chaos
happening across these pages,

428ff13e-2ad7-420b-8ca2-a1f91c181f0b-1
00:50:20.213 --> 00:50:26.816
it's the colors used are bright
and cheerful, lots of greens and

428ff13e-2ad7-420b-8ca2-a1f91c181f0b-2
00:50:26.816 --> 00:50:33.115
pinks and Blues, like a lot of
really vibrant primary colors.

428ff13e-2ad7-420b-8ca2-a1f91c181f0b-3
00:50:33.115 --> 00:50:38.702
And the scene itself is
primarily a canal splitting or

428ff13e-2ad7-420b-8ca2-a1f91c181f0b-4
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:44.290
bifurcating the page, so we've
got like a scene below.

186c89fc-3eb2-4ad7-a8ea-bea8db4a43b3-0
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.160
and a scene above the canal.

0f227b24-a2d9-41e3-a1f6-c6385c326763-0
00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:52.290
Which are both these kind of
fields that have lots of people

0f227b24-a2d9-41e3-a1f6-c6385c326763-1
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.740
and lots of activities going on.

9e4d555c-6348-46bf-8d65-5c0b49465b3d-0
00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:01.116
In the fields, we've got tents
on one side of the canal and

9e4d555c-6348-46bf-8d65-5c0b49465b3d-1
00:51:01.116 --> 00:51:05.803
camper vans on the other side.
So I guess in the scene that's

9e4d555c-6348-46bf-8d65-5c0b49465b3d-2
00:51:05.803 --> 00:51:09.810
kind of like on the closer side
like the towards us.

de92865c-dbe1-4605-ac8f-47b6471781c9-0
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.735
Are the ones that are tents. So
we've got like maybe

de92865c-dbe1-4605-ac8f-47b6471781c9-1
00:51:16.735 --> 00:51:22.790
3456789101213 or between 13 and
14 tents set up with activities

de92865c-dbe1-4605-ac8f-47b6471781c9-2
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:28.657
happening all around them. Like
definitely camping activities

de92865c-dbe1-4605-ac8f-47b6471781c9-3
00:51:28.657 --> 00:51:30.550
ranging from people.

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-0
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.008
Cooking. Cooking. Like s'mores.
Or at least it looks like

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-1
00:51:36.008 --> 00:51:39.614
they're Oh no, wait, they're
being served coffee. OK, so

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-2
00:51:39.614 --> 00:51:43.409
they're they're being served
coffee, except that the person

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-3
00:51:43.409 --> 00:51:47.330
pouring the coffee missed and
just pouring it onto one of the

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-4
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:51.252
people instead. There's a guy
with a guitar that's sitting on

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-5
00:51:51.252 --> 00:51:54.857
the ground and surrounded by
people who are listening to

80134fcf-5326-47c6-833d-012218c1b95c-6
00:51:54.857 --> 00:51:58.399
them, just like I think they're
supposed to be hippies.

1b864a12-b0de-4fab-9c18-801826d6b9e6-0
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.359
There's a dog in the scene.
There's some people blowing up a

1b864a12-b0de-4fab-9c18-801826d6b9e6-1
00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:03.670
raft.

8038b3a0-edd2-4ade-980d-a917df034a32-0
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.830
And.

8ac52796-d06d-4464-aaa2-90c23f4aa133-0
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.530
In addition, you know, to to the
camping activities happening

8ac52796-d06d-4464-aaa2-90c23f4aa133-1
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:16.911
around the tent scene, there's
just like probably about 100 or

8ac52796-d06d-4464-aaa2-90c23f4aa133-2
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:21.013
so people ranging in ages from
very very young to probably

8ac52796-d06d-4464-aaa2-90c23f4aa133-3
00:52:21.013 --> 00:52:24.907
middle age or so. Not, not
anyone too old. There is one

8ac52796-d06d-4464-aaa2-90c23f4aa133-4
00:52:24.907 --> 00:52:27.480
hiker that's, that's pretty old
but.

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-0
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.845
There's just lots of activities
inside the canal itself. Um,

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-1
00:52:32.845 --> 00:52:36.670
there is at least one canal
boat, a couple of mermaids, some

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-2
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.182
fish, somebody's fishing.
There's a bridge crossing the

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-3
00:52:40.182 --> 00:52:43.882
canal, and underneath the bridge
it looks like there's two

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-4
00:52:43.882 --> 00:52:47.833
people, like kind of just doing
a log ride or or maybe they're

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-5
00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:51.658
just doing like a Venice. Oh
yeah, that's what it's meant to

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-6
00:52:51.658 --> 00:52:55.358
be. They're like in a Venice
style canal boat with the big

dc6b5f79-becd-4796-8b4e-4553bf9115e0-7
00:52:55.358 --> 00:52:56.550
rod and everything.

50217c5f-28fc-49db-bb28-4058f04ac331-0
00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:03.118
In addition, this is back on our
side of the canal. We see a

50217c5f-28fc-49db-bb28-4058f04ac331-1
00:53:03.118 --> 00:53:08.240
couple of bulls in one of the
small fields. There's also these

50217c5f-28fc-49db-bb28-4058f04ac331-2
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:13.036
walkways and there's tons of
people just walking around on

50217c5f-28fc-49db-bb28-4058f04ac331-3
00:53:13.036 --> 00:53:17.914
the walkways. Most mostly there
are people I think carrying

50217c5f-28fc-49db-bb28-4058f04ac331-4
00:53:17.914 --> 00:53:22.873
packs as if they're hiking or
camping or something. And then

50217c5f-28fc-49db-bb28-4058f04ac331-5
00:53:22.873 --> 00:53:27.670
on the far side of the canal is
where all the camper vans.

72184875-7678-4835-9575-fc2d8ba9a883-0
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:32.013
are. There's 34579 camper vans,
yeah. And once again, like the

72184875-7678-4835-9575-fc2d8ba9a883-1
00:53:32.013 --> 00:53:36.074
activity is over on that side
are more subdued. It actually

72184875-7678-4835-9575-fc2d8ba9a883-2
00:53:36.074 --> 00:53:40.067
looks like there's just more
people standing around having

72184875-7678-4835-9575-fc2d8ba9a883-3
00:53:40.067 --> 00:53:43.789
conversations than anything
else. One camper van is in

72184875-7678-4835-9575-fc2d8ba9a883-4
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:47.850
distress. It looks like they've
had a fire going on, on the

72184875-7678-4835-9575-fc2d8ba9a883-5
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:48.730
inside of it.

723f6826-5e91-41fc-a8d7-25cea651e895-0
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.946
And in the background we see
fields, some additional bulls,

723f6826-5e91-41fc-a8d7-25cea651e895-1
00:53:53.946 --> 00:53:58.103
are at least one bull chasing a
couple of people, people on

723f6826-5e91-41fc-a8d7-25cea651e895-2
00:53:58.103 --> 00:54:02.606
bikes. Overall, over the entire
scene, I mean, there's likely to

723f6826-5e91-41fc-a8d7-25cea651e895-3
00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:06.763
be at least 200, if not more
people. And the whole scene is

723f6826-5e91-41fc-a8d7-25cea651e895-4
00:54:06.763 --> 00:54:08.980
like just camping. #END_campsite

c3d47037-8368-420d-aa8b-dc10cef030e5-0
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:17.510
OK, perfect.

a95547dc-4994-4cd8-8e38-9c9a2151b742-0
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.830
Next one, OK. The next one is
also a complex scene.

6e834d57-ef1f-406e-9cc9-46c07f057010-0
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:43.360
OK, so same thing as.

73b898c0-bc0e-4ac9-b235-bd0895ab504e-0
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.247
Before, it's just one scene.
#START_waldo_1 So this is the

73b898c0-bc0e-4ac9-b235-bd0895ab504e-1
00:54:49.247 --> 00:54:54.320
sort of of an over sort of a
bird's eye view of a city, like

73b898c0-bc0e-4ac9-b235-bd0895ab504e-2
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.810
the middle of a small city where
we've got a triangular Rotary. I

73b898c0-bc0e-4ac9-b235-bd0895ab504e-3
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:05.050
guess it's not really a Rotary
if it's a triangle, but an area

73b898c0-bc0e-4ac9-b235-bd0895ab504e-4
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:09.790
of town that's shaped like a
triangle in the very center

73b898c0-bc0e-4ac9-b235-bd0895ab504e-5
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:10.290
where.

cbc3aa73-4eaf-41a2-8864-a056689b93b9-0
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:18.226
Several streets intersect, and
so we've got vehicles who are

cbc3aa73-4eaf-41a2-8864-a056689b93b9-1
00:55:18.226 --> 00:55:23.862
navigating this, this triangle
like a center of town.

cbc3aa73-4eaf-41a2-8864-a056689b93b9-2
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:29.603
Surrounding it are various
buildings, shops, apartment

cbc3aa73-4eaf-41a2-8864-a056689b93b9-3
00:55:29.603 --> 00:55:35.134
buildings, and additional
sidewalks. And then in the

cbc3aa73-4eaf-41a2-8864-a056689b93b9-4
00:55:35.134 --> 00:55:41.710
background we've got what looks
to be a school and a hospital.

c72949dd-350b-453c-ae3f-92366ee81343-0
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:48.770
And a fire station. So the
activity that's happening around

c72949dd-350b-453c-ae3f-92366ee81343-1
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:49.900
this area.

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-0
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:55.254
Are various things that you
would see in a city, you know,

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-1
00:55:55.254 --> 00:55:59.694
so we've got people in their own
apartment buildings that are

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-2
00:55:59.694 --> 00:56:03.560
leaning out the window, watering
their plants, having

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-3
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:07.785
conversations with people in
other windows. We have people

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-4
00:56:07.785 --> 00:56:12.009
going into the shops. So in one
area there's a barbershop,

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-5
00:56:12.009 --> 00:56:16.091
there's a Barber pole, and
people are going into it with

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-6
00:56:16.091 --> 00:56:20.387
incredibly long hair and coming
out of it with much shorter

c00b0240-2fe7-485d-8583-2bd125f57ebc-7
00:56:20.387 --> 00:56:21.389
hair. There's.

3a4bb6ba-44a9-49a0-9a3b-0705373e4a9a-0
00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.140
Uh.

df00a38c-08f0-4a8d-9bff-ec03a6ee8acc-0
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:27.696
There's a hospital scene in the
background where we've got

df00a38c-08f0-4a8d-9bff-ec03a6ee8acc-1
00:56:27.696 --> 00:56:32.603
people dressed as if they worked
in hospitals, like wearing

df00a38c-08f0-4a8d-9bff-ec03a6ee8acc-2
00:56:32.603 --> 00:56:37.593
scrubs and doctor's uniform
rushing out helping victims of a

df00a38c-08f0-4a8d-9bff-ec03a6ee8acc-3
00:56:37.593 --> 00:56:41.520
bike accident that looks like it
just happened.

7ca1f2fe-fe27-419c-a36d-841caa0a3ede-0
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:48.212
And in the background also is a
school, it looks like somebody

7ca1f2fe-fe27-419c-a36d-841caa0a3ede-1
00:56:48.212 --> 00:56:52.621
like a principal or somebody is
standing outside of a school

7ca1f2fe-fe27-419c-a36d-841caa0a3ede-2
00:56:52.621 --> 00:56:56.885
that's gated and outside are
students on the sidewalk that

7ca1f2fe-fe27-419c-a36d-841caa0a3ede-3
00:56:56.885 --> 00:57:00.860
are walking towards school, the
clock on the school's.

fe476f65-92f2-4ee3-8c36-6d8f39d76d94-0
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:06.326
Facade looks like it's early in
the morning, so probably the

fe476f65-92f2-4ee3-8c36-6d8f39d76d94-1
00:57:06.326 --> 00:57:07.380
start of school.

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-0
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:13.572
In the foreground, there's just
other, you know, chaotic scenes.

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-1
00:57:13.572 --> 00:57:18.079
Um, there's some maintenance
people on the top of one of the

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-2
00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:22.513
buildings that are having some
kind of a mop fight, wearing

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-3
00:57:22.513 --> 00:57:26.946
buckets on their head as one of
the other workers looks on.

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-4
00:57:26.946 --> 00:57:31.305
While he's looking on, he's
feeding the birds. We also see

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-5
00:57:31.305 --> 00:57:35.738
in the foreground some kind of
like a a farmers market with

70eb5c5c-9122-4add-ad8c-713935285619-6
00:57:35.738 --> 00:57:38.989
tents set up and people milling
around and.

12cc54f1-3319-4150-80a2-025bd8d288ad-0
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.950
And buying things from plants to
it's hard to say what else

12cc54f1-3319-4150-80a2-025bd8d288ad-1
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:47.079
they're buying. There's there's
a man playing the violin in the

12cc54f1-3319-4150-80a2-025bd8d288ad-2
00:57:47.079 --> 00:57:48.950
middle of the farmers market.

4fe599b0-cb0f-4775-9c68-3c3fab013d66-0
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.330
And in the middle of the
triangle is a fountain. And

4fe599b0-cb0f-4775-9c68-3c3fab013d66-1
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:59.705
people are looking at the
fountain and at least one guy

4fe599b0-cb0f-4775-9c68-3c3fab013d66-2
00:57:59.705 --> 00:57:59.940
is.

d7ff86d3-c442-4344-8e3b-a2aa1b419fff-0
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.960
Playing in the fountain, wearing
fins and a snorkel, and he's

d7ff86d3-c442-4344-8e3b-a2aa1b419fff-1
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.932
like being lifted up by the
fountain. And there's also a

d7ff86d3-c442-4344-8e3b-a2aa1b419fff-2
00:58:08.932 --> 00:58:12.765
statue of um Looks like some
kind of a Greek shirtless

d7ff86d3-c442-4344-8e3b-a2aa1b419fff-3
00:58:12.765 --> 00:58:17.015
soldier, and he's holding a bow
and pulling or Roman I guess

d7ff86d3-c442-4344-8e3b-a2aa1b419fff-4
00:58:17.015 --> 00:58:20.500
Roman is the one that has those
kinds of helmets.

bced887c-c3d3-4f95-b49a-7b275dd4f573-0
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:26.437
And he's the statue is holding a
bow, and nearby is a car that

bced887c-c3d3-4f95-b49a-7b275dd4f573-1
00:58:26.437 --> 00:58:30.746
looks like it has a flat tire,
possibly because an arrow went

bced887c-c3d3-4f95-b49a-7b275dd4f573-2
00:58:30.746 --> 00:58:35.054
through it so confusingly, it
looks like this statue shot the

bced887c-c3d3-4f95-b49a-7b275dd4f573-3
00:58:35.054 --> 00:58:37.070
arrow that went into the car.

28ac275c-2f70-44a7-b10a-04d61f03ab37-0
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:42.813
And yeah, so that is the scene.
It's businesses and residential

28ac275c-2f70-44a7-b10a-04d61f03ab37-1
00:58:42.813 --> 00:58:46.798
buildings and commercial,
commercial buildings and lots of

28ac275c-2f70-44a7-b10a-04d61f03ab37-2
00:58:46.798 --> 00:58:50.784
people. #END_waldo_1 Perfect.
Thank you. Let's see what we

28ac275c-2f70-44a7-b10a-04d61f03ab37-3
00:58:50.784 --> 00:58:51.459
have next.

eaaf6c60-ed2a-4148-8835-8e4e8cf5452c-0
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:56.560
OK, we have another complex
scene next.

5a644609-cef5-40de-8783-bd51eb84b46c-0
00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:14.150
OK.

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-0
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.808
#START_wild_west All right. So
this is generally the scene of

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-1
00:59:21.808 --> 00:59:26.696
like a pioneer town, like an Old
West, a Wild West. There's a

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-2
00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:31.506
caption on this one, too that
just says the wild, Wild West.

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-3
00:59:31.506 --> 00:59:35.763
And so I think that in this
scene we see a lot of the

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-4
00:59:35.763 --> 00:59:40.258
different kinds of really
cliched buildings and costumes

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-5
00:59:40.258 --> 00:59:45.225
and people that you would see in
the Wild West. So most of the

5cdf303f-1a82-43aa-93fd-3add1670c80b-6
00:59:45.225 --> 00:59:46.960
most of the buildings.

aa289603-3ac3-4fdc-acf1-4ed511a02562-0
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:52.826
Are the kinds of facades that
have the, the, I don't know,

aa289603-3ac3-4fdc-acf1-4ed511a02562-1
00:59:52.826 --> 00:59:57.820
honky-tonk kind of like
lettering on them that say

aa289603-3ac3-4fdc-acf1-4ed511a02562-2
00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.169
saloon, hotel, jail and.

7f3d2638-a5fa-4f8c-8d15-171af6660275-0
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:09.403
But behind the facades are are
basically you can you can see

7f3d2638-a5fa-4f8c-8d15-171af6660275-1
01:00:09.403 --> 01:00:13.530
that there's a lot going on,
sort of like behind.

5ae1e411-2eb2-4fcd-90d1-cc6e53c5ea0b-0
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:22.301
The, the, the, the facade
itself. So in front of these

5ae1e411-2eb2-4fcd-90d1-cc6e53c5ea0b-1
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:29.430
buildings are tons of people
dressed in cowboy boots.

a7c0adeb-0d3a-47da-80d1-26296a8fe51f-0
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:36.027
You know, vests, cowboy hats, a
lot of them have guns, are using

a7c0adeb-0d3a-47da-80d1-26296a8fe51f-1
01:00:36.027 --> 01:00:40.548
guns on each other or just
carrying them. The women are

a7c0adeb-0d3a-47da-80d1-26296a8fe51f-2
01:00:40.548 --> 01:00:44.100
dressed more like in Victorian
era dresses.

1c43a515-0c0a-426e-ac33-576fb1720725-0
01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.041
And then there's a lot that
doesn't really kind of make

1c43a515-0c0a-426e-ac33-576fb1720725-1
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:53.186
sense about, like, what's going
on in this scene. So, for

1c43a515-0c0a-426e-ac33-576fb1720725-2
01:00:53.186 --> 01:00:57.402
example, there's like a herd of
bison or a herd of Buffalo

1c43a515-0c0a-426e-ac33-576fb1720725-3
01:00:57.402 --> 01:01:01.833
that's coming through town, but
they're not actually Buffalo.

1c43a515-0c0a-426e-ac33-576fb1720725-4
01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:06.335
They're just Buffalo stamps. We
see like a horse in the middle

1c43a515-0c0a-426e-ac33-576fb1720725-5
01:01:06.335 --> 01:01:10.480
of the road that's drawing a
portrait of a covered wagon.

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-0
01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.288
In the background of one of the
scenes, we we see a cowboy

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-1
01:01:15.288 --> 01:01:18.428
that's riding off onto the
sunset and everyone's waving

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-2
01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:21.848
goodbye to him and he's he's
turning around and not watching

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-3
01:01:21.848 --> 01:01:25.381
where he's going and he's waving
goodbye to them. But he's not

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-4
01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:28.408
really riding off into the
sunset. He's riding into a

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-5
01:01:28.408 --> 01:01:32.109
billboard or some kind of like a
canvas or something, so it's not

977b8995-69a3-454f-9cf5-d3657d223eee-6
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.389
real.

17c437df-5c2f-4f88-8f74-32804552ea7f-0
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:38.604
So I mean like it's a lot of a
lot of scenes like that, you

17c437df-5c2f-4f88-8f74-32804552ea7f-1
01:01:38.604 --> 01:01:44.014
know, there's a, there's a, a, a
Stagecoach that's in the middle

17c437df-5c2f-4f88-8f74-32804552ea7f-2
01:01:44.014 --> 01:01:49.009
of a rail, like a railroad, and
there's an engine coming, a

17c437df-5c2f-4f88-8f74-32804552ea7f-3
01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:53.587
steam engine coming down, a
locomotive coming down the

17c437df-5c2f-4f88-8f74-32804552ea7f-4
01:01:53.587 --> 01:01:58.998
railroad. Except that of course
the the Stagecoach is in the way

17c437df-5c2f-4f88-8f74-32804552ea7f-5
01:01:58.998 --> 01:02:03.160
and it looks like the Stagecoach
is being robbed.

c705fc80-177e-4c9d-b8b2-2781d4ba2849-0
01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.390
By bandits that have their faces
covered.

9cdc90ed-7db3-45bb-aecc-844d7e96b435-0
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:07.700
Umm.

b8b26d59-7a60-40bf-8d80-96bb8c11b82b-0
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:12.445
I'm trying to think there's
there's a lots of people who are

b8b26d59-7a60-40bf-8d80-96bb8c11b82b-1
01:02:12.445 --> 01:02:14.090
painting some of the buildings.

543649b3-3e03-4398-8401-5f26d2c709a1-0
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.850
I'm just looking for more of
these like.

e05d7e55-c3b3-49fe-9c7e-76e14e15546f-0
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:21.520
Visual absurdities.

fc7d80b3-ea11-48a2-a4e4-4fcc5f779960-0
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:28.447
Yeah, there's like a fake couple
of gold mines that people are

fc7d80b3-ea11-48a2-a4e4-4fcc5f779960-1
01:02:28.447 --> 01:02:32.977
are going into. It's almost as
if the whole thing is like an

fc7d80b3-ea11-48a2-a4e4-4fcc5f779960-2
01:02:32.977 --> 01:02:37.803
attraction, you know, like, like
none of it is real. It's almost

fc7d80b3-ea11-48a2-a4e4-4fcc5f779960-3
01:02:37.803 --> 01:02:39.140
like a theme park.

bb7c5db6-386d-4806-bf46-0d6d72516a9a-0
01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.496
Once again, like just hundreds
of people in this scene.

bb7c5db6-386d-4806-bf46-0d6d72516a9a-1
01:02:43.496 --> 01:02:44.250
#END_wild_west

9724ef14-f5a6-4d5b-965d-c24987a3cae4-0
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.190
OK, perfect.

11533c2b-d77b-4a04-a6e1-10b894424697-0
01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.450
Let's see what we have.

3b0bc03f-c58f-4103-b902-1c5c232b6072-0
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.970
Next. OK, Next is a short story.

9544fc6c-eb70-4819-8a78-0191e0adbc9b-0
01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:14.010


39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-0
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.254
OK, there we go. And I'm going
to share my scene. This one's

39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-1
01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:24.717
approximately 11 slides. And
same thing with the stories.

39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-2
01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:29.642
When you're done with one slide,
let me know and I will move on

39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-3
01:03:29.642 --> 01:03:33.336
with it. OK? OK.
#START_flowerman All right. So

39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-4
01:03:33.336 --> 01:03:38.184
here we have a real bleak scene
that's mostly black and white,

39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-5
01:03:38.184 --> 01:03:42.878
of what looks like an abandoned
town that there's one person

39490b48-e66b-458f-a037-d25e97cd33e6-6
01:03:42.878 --> 01:03:44.110
trying to enter.

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-0
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.878
He's crossing a bridge. He's the
only thing in the scene that's

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-1
01:03:48.878 --> 01:03:53.119
kind of in color. So we can
guess that the story is about

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-2
01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:57.797
him and he's entering this real
bleak abandoned town. Maybe not

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-3
01:03:57.797 --> 01:04:02.184
abandoned. I mean, there are
some people that we can see in

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-4
01:04:02.184 --> 01:04:06.132
the foreground of these
buildings and there are smoke

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-5
01:04:06.132 --> 01:04:10.810
coming out of the chimneys, but
it looks like this is not, this

4ee04ee4-138f-42de-b3db-b59f6a4e7d73-6
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:14.320
is not a place that's booming
with like, modern

ecdebf4a-8fd5-488f-9997-ed5380358b43-0
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.160
Day success. {Go to The next.}

2d9d3ccf-1b08-4423-a9da-13c806ba397b-0
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.457
So our protagonist is now
standing sort of more at a

2d9d3ccf-1b08-4423-a9da-13c806ba397b-1
01:04:27.457 --> 01:04:32.471
crossroads in the middle of the
town. It's like a cobbled Street

2d9d3ccf-1b08-4423-a9da-13c806ba397b-2
01:04:32.471 --> 01:04:32.780
and.

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-0
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:38.094
The the buildings surrounding
him look kind of worn out. The

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-1
01:04:38.094 --> 01:04:42.644
shutters don't look like they're
in great shape. The the curtains

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-2
01:04:42.644 --> 01:04:46.573
are tattered. The in the
background we do see that there

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-3
01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:50.916
are people that we can kind of
see through the windows. That's

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-4
01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:54.777
very difficult to tell what
they're doing. At least one

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-5
01:04:54.777 --> 01:04:59.257
person on a motorbike is in the
background, sort of like heading

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-6
01:04:59.257 --> 01:05:02.635
into the direction of the
intersection where our

2df05e28-30b4-48f4-b31e-8cf0a0e33b40-7
01:05:02.635 --> 01:05:04.290
protagonist is standing.

07b09160-bc06-4baa-ad02-2a3ee9006d41-0
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.250
And once again, everything is
black and white except for him.

e5705114-094f-4d64-9541-81f7b4fd98b3-0
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.620
Or her.

8edbf1e5-8756-43b0-99c4-068eb7aea055-0
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:12.446
We can't really tell because
we're looking down from a bird's

8edbf1e5-8756-43b0-99c4-068eb7aea055-1
01:05:12.446 --> 01:05:12.890
eye view.

d0de03fd-4c4b-43aa-b22c-b8ba38044208-0
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.183
And the next scene our
protagonist is standing. We now

d0de03fd-4c4b-43aa-b22c-b8ba38044208-1
01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:24.001
see that it's it's more clear
that he's holding some kind of a

d0de03fd-4c4b-43aa-b22c-b8ba38044208-2
01:05:24.001 --> 01:05:25.880
handbag and wearing a blue hat.

99e33fe1-d5d7-4452-8b4e-7815c0263dfc-0
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.934
He is once again standing on the
sidewalk of a cobblestone

99e33fe1-d5d7-4452-8b4e-7815c0263dfc-1
01:05:32.934 --> 01:05:38.057
Street, looking up at these
buildings. The, the architecture

99e33fe1-d5d7-4452-8b4e-7815c0263dfc-2
01:05:38.057 --> 01:05:42.928
of these buildings is very
storybook like, you know, with

99e33fe1-d5d7-4452-8b4e-7815c0263dfc-3
01:05:42.928 --> 01:05:48.051
sort of skewed perspective on
the houses themselves. Nothing

99e33fe1-d5d7-4452-8b4e-7815c0263dfc-4
01:05:48.051 --> 01:05:53.174
is quite rectangular. Everything
is angled in a sort of like

99e33fe1-d5d7-4452-8b4e-7815c0263dfc-5
01:05:53.174 --> 01:05:57.290
fairy tale kind of a way. And
here we get to see

25804ad0-ce15-4af6-adfe-99bc39fe74fc-0
01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:02.779
A lot more activity that in each
of the windows of the buildings

25804ad0-ce15-4af6-adfe-99bc39fe74fc-1
01:06:02.779 --> 01:06:07.735
is activity of some kind, you
know, from people painting to

25804ad0-ce15-4af6-adfe-99bc39fe74fc-2
01:06:07.735 --> 01:06:12.774
watching television or just
people standing together. And we

25804ad0-ce15-4af6-adfe-99bc39fe74fc-3
01:06:12.774 --> 01:06:16.739
see some people in the
background and two small

25804ad0-ce15-4af6-adfe-99bc39fe74fc-4
01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:21.696
children kind of like looking,
looking on at him. There's a

25804ad0-ce15-4af6-adfe-99bc39fe74fc-5
01:06:21.696 --> 01:06:26.570
clock nearby and it looks to
probably be about 6:30 or so.

12bd8226-82a4-40bc-8fe0-8c2cfaa0f03a-0
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.760
{You can go next.}

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-0
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:39.510
In this next scene, we see the
very small house that was on the

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-1
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:43.735
corner. This is the house he was
standing in front of before,

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-2
01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:47.891
much smaller and more modest
than the houses that surrounded

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-3
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:52.115
it. But the the protagonist now
seems like this is his house,

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-4
01:06:52.115 --> 01:06:55.999
and he's standing up on a
ladder. The entire house is in

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-5
01:06:55.999 --> 01:06:59.746
color, including part of the
tree that's still on that

08ed4f42-0809-4104-a52d-50a4f27b7d1b-6
01:06:59.746 --> 01:07:00.359
property.

e49a2d29-a420-444f-82c3-98bee49993e7-0
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.324
Everything else is in black and
white. He's standing up on a

e49a2d29-a420-444f-82c3-98bee49993e7-1
01:07:05.324 --> 01:07:08.968
ladder and it looks as if he's
doing some work on one of the

e49a2d29-a420-444f-82c3-98bee49993e7-2
01:07:08.968 --> 01:07:12.493
shutters. Everyone nearby is
still in black and white, but

e49a2d29-a420-444f-82c3-98bee49993e7-3
01:07:12.493 --> 01:07:16.376
now there's a lot more people on
the scene, on the street, up in

e49a2d29-a420-444f-82c3-98bee49993e7-4
01:07:16.376 --> 01:07:17.869
their windows, up in the.

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-0
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:23.287
Maybe not on the rooftops, but
um, but it looks as if, you

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-1
01:07:23.287 --> 01:07:27.637
know, like he's he's putting
some care and some effort into

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-2
01:07:27.637 --> 01:07:31.697
this one place. And it's
possible that that's what, you

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-3
01:07:31.697 --> 01:07:36.047
know, that's what it takes to
kind of bring the color back.

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-4
01:07:36.047 --> 01:07:39.745
People are watching and
observing what he's doing.

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-5
01:07:39.745 --> 01:07:43.805
There's a girl, a couple of
girls actually kind of like

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-6
01:07:43.805 --> 01:07:48.372
looking on with wonder. At least
one of the girl's mother, you

1e4b3285-f788-4171-b136-59edce9c40ef-7
01:07:48.372 --> 01:07:50.040
know, looks disdainful.

94149eb7-d8d8-4c05-8279-f98c52f3a757-0
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:56.091
At like what's happening? She's
she's feeling, you know, put out

94149eb7-d8d8-4c05-8279-f98c52f3a757-1
01:07:56.091 --> 01:08:00.600
by having her daughter look at
this with wonder.

3d814b69-6246-4214-a1aa-1ec01f09a78c-0
01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.550
So yeah, this the scene is.

59a5ab42-87ac-47b0-b9b5-0185d7339bcf-0
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:08.941
You know, it's just very
involved with lots of people

59a5ab42-87ac-47b0-b9b5-0185d7339bcf-1
01:08:08.941 --> 01:08:12.439
around. Most everyone is like,
you know, carrying on with their

59a5ab42-87ac-47b0-b9b5-0185d7339bcf-2
01:08:12.439 --> 01:08:13.150
own business.

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-0
01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.969
In the next scene, it appears as
if the old man whose house this

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-1
01:08:22.969 --> 01:08:27.260
is has had some success in
getting things cleaned up. The

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-2
01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.552
yard looks much better. There's
flowers on the fence that

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-3
01:08:31.552 --> 01:08:36.361
surround his house. His house is
in good shape. Everything about

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-4
01:08:36.361 --> 01:08:41.170
his house is in color. The tree
behind the house is also sort of

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-5
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:45.240
like a colorful, autumnal
looking, you know, just like

dd5cd7fa-cc31-4180-a980-6da29ee47a95-6
01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.350
deciduous tree.

0bfa4cb5-71de-4633-99cd-a89e5861dac2-0
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:51.770
And now there is one other
character in color, which is

0bfa4cb5-71de-4633-99cd-a89e5861dac2-1
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:55.760
this small girl who's walking
away from his house.

db96af96-7084-4fbb-9dda-b549bfe932f2-0
01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.503
And he's waving goodbye to her.
And as she's walking away, she's

db96af96-7084-4fbb-9dda-b549bfe932f2-1
01:09:01.503 --> 01:09:06.279
doing something in front of her.
But it's hard to say. Everything

db96af96-7084-4fbb-9dda-b549bfe932f2-2
01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:10.910
else is in color. I mean, sorry,
it's still in black and white.

70540ab7-3469-4a41-a28a-cb7a8b26ee2d-0
01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.547
So, I mean, he's had some effect
on his environment, but only for

70540ab7-3469-4a41-a28a-cb7a8b26ee2d-1
01:09:16.547 --> 01:09:20.667
this one person. Meanwhile, it
looks as if there's some kind of

70540ab7-3469-4a41-a28a-cb7a8b26ee2d-2
01:09:20.667 --> 01:09:24.399
a thief character hovering
nearby his house he's wearing.

6ab7790e-d6bd-40cc-9aa4-52a653364858-0
01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:30.610
A mask over his eyes, and he's
got the really like kind of

6ab7790e-d6bd-40cc-9aa4-52a653364858-1
01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:36.083
cliched striped shirt and beret,
so it's possible that he's

6ab7790e-d6bd-40cc-9aa4-52a653364858-2
01:09:36.083 --> 01:09:41.920
looking at this colorful house,
looking to rob it or something.

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-0
01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:46.580
Meanwhile, everyone else once
again is carrying on with their

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-1
01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.258
own business. The guy on the
scooter coming down the street

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-2
01:09:50.258 --> 01:09:54.058
takes notice of the colorful
girl. The milkman I think that's

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-3
01:09:54.058 --> 01:09:58.043
down the street also is kind of
looking on with astonishment. We

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-4
01:09:58.043 --> 01:10:01.843
now see that there is a painter
in one of the windows and now

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-5
01:10:01.843 --> 01:10:05.828
he's not inside of his apartment
painting. He's kind of come out

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-6
01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:09.689
onto his ledge and is looking
down at the girl. So it seems as

faa81be4-bdc0-41f2-8bd4-d78cb9853e21-7
01:10:09.689 --> 01:10:12.999
if though everyone is sort of
living their own lives.

8071d693-8619-4288-8652-3786d6fa1eaf-0
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:17.490
They've now taken more notice of
this change that's happening.

d7e8ae7c-7de0-4132-b970-281b8a7cba26-0
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.220
All right, so everything is much
more colorful in this next

d7e8ae7c-7de0-4132-b970-281b8a7cba26-1
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.806
scene. The man with the colorful
house remains so. But now many

d7e8ae7c-7de0-4132-b970-281b8a7cba26-2
01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:34.178
more of the characters that
surround his house are in color.

d7e8ae7c-7de0-4132-b970-281b8a7cba26-3
01:10:34.178 --> 01:10:37.690
So we have a lot more children
who are colorful.

af366a91-bf1c-40b7-b7be-ee890f938af7-0
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.254
And ohh, he's not a thief at all
now he's just kind of like

af366a91-bf1c-40b7-b7be-ee890f938af7-1
01:10:42.254 --> 01:10:44.970
hanging out. Maybe I was
mistaken about the thief.

a1279c2c-d7f2-43a6-8116-4e237158b32f-0
01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.342
We've we've got people in their
own homes that we can see

a1279c2c-d7f2-43a6-8116-4e237158b32f-1
01:10:50.342 --> 01:10:54.215
through their windows who are
colorful. The painter very much

a1279c2c-d7f2-43a6-8116-4e237158b32f-2
01:10:54.215 --> 01:10:55.590
has color in his life.

f1e055f0-6fbc-47ac-b350-f488a490a2c0-0
01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:00.783
The there's there are some
people who are moving. So it

f1e055f0-6fbc-47ac-b350-f488a490a2c0-1
01:11:00.783 --> 01:11:05.607
seems as if the woman who looked
on earlier, that all of this new

f1e055f0-6fbc-47ac-b350-f488a490a2c0-2
01:11:05.607 --> 01:11:10.065
change was dreadful. She and her
family are choosing to move

f1e055f0-6fbc-47ac-b350-f488a490a2c0-3
01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:14.670
rather than to stay in this new
world with all of the color in

f1e055f0-6fbc-47ac-b350-f488a490a2c0-4
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:14.890
it.

9b5dfd4c-197f-4fda-af23-cf1a227a14ee-0
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.950
But yeah, it looks as if, you
know, there's some change

9b5dfd4c-197f-4fda-af23-cf1a227a14ee-1
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:24.900
happening and some people are
accepting it and some people are

9b5dfd4c-197f-4fda-af23-cf1a227a14ee-2
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.530
are not and and moving on.

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-0
01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.519
OK, in this next scene it looks
as if pretty much everyone who

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-1
01:11:36.519 --> 01:11:41.440
remained is now in full color.
The color ranges from like the

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-2
01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.885
buildings to the people
themselves, to the tiles on the

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-3
01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:50.488
ceiling or on the tile tiles on
the roofs which are multi

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-4
01:11:50.488 --> 01:11:55.329
colored, and in a couple of
different cases. The milkman has

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-5
01:11:55.329 --> 01:11:59.615
found love, I guess in the
intersection of one of the

60ccfdae-e481-47f7-98d2-96d3cc595342-6
01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.250
streets.

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-0
01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:05.326
A child is playing in the
fountain. This time everyone is

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-1
01:12:05.326 --> 01:12:10.101
going about their own business,
but everyone seems to be in a

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-2
01:12:10.101 --> 01:12:14.414
much better mood. And the man
who started this story is

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-3
01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:19.266
lifting a small child into the
air as a an old woman who's now

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-4
01:12:19.266 --> 01:12:23.964
on his property is also nearby.
And they're grilling, so you

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-5
01:12:23.964 --> 01:12:28.431
know, they're having some kind
of a a get together. Yeah,

c5ed9f6b-6f18-46a1-9c47-d06a7fa6ba25-6
01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.280
everyone who remains is.

20359895-bf74-4925-b185-5e37ae2d3a8a-0
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.410
Seems very happy with this new
world.

629081e3-cb88-4fff-a019-6a26cc52fdc8-0
01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.770
In this last scene, it looks as
if the man who came on the scene

629081e3-cb88-4fff-a019-6a26cc52fdc8-1
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:50.861
to begin with might actually be
leaving. It seems like, you know

629081e3-cb88-4fff-a019-6a26cc52fdc8-2
01:12:50.861 --> 01:12:51.329
he's.

3351c835-c889-487d-9f31-4f0e3839984f-0
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:57.548
Sort of like exiting the scene
away from his house. You know, I

3351c835-c889-487d-9f31-4f0e3839984f-1
01:12:57.548 --> 01:13:01.672
think he's wearing his hat and
he has his bag in hand.

3351c835-c889-487d-9f31-4f0e3839984f-2
01:13:01.672 --> 01:13:06.095
Everything remains incredibly
colorful. People are doing a

3351c835-c889-487d-9f31-4f0e3839984f-3
01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:08.270
street race like a foot race.

1863c000-172a-4591-af0d-0ca0af307ad9-0
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:14.194
There is a scene where two
people are on a date in the

1863c000-172a-4591-af0d-0ca0af307ad9-1
01:13:14.194 --> 01:13:17.190
foreground near one of the
fountains.

bd1e2c1a-5608-406d-8481-5af4cfcc35f6-0
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:23.672
You know, neighbors are chatting
with each other. There's a

bd1e2c1a-5608-406d-8481-5af4cfcc35f6-1
01:13:23.672 --> 01:13:28.976
couple that's kind of like in an
embrace in the background. The

bd1e2c1a-5608-406d-8481-5af4cfcc35f6-2
01:13:28.976 --> 01:13:31.380
painter is not in his window.

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.447
I don't see where he went.
There's somebody on the rooftop

ad12c574-51af-4c6c-8eba-aafa69f4de4f-1
01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:41.949
who's in his towel decorating? I
don't know. Just wave just

ad12c574-51af-4c6c-8eba-aafa69f4de4f-2
01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:43.450
waving at the world?

b2db8f13-558e-4ece-b762-4227b39209de-0
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:48.828
And yeah, so generally speaking,
I think everyone has found new

b2db8f13-558e-4ece-b762-4227b39209de-1
01:13:48.828 --> 01:13:52.380
connections with the people in
their lives. So they're no

b2db8f13-558e-4ece-b762-4227b39209de-2
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.625
longer living their lives
independently, now they're

b2db8f13-558e-4ece-b762-4227b39209de-3
01:13:55.625 --> 01:13:57.340
living their lives together.

68079a91-bf9f-4f0d-8073-04ca7d2f8d02-0
01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:05.332
And in the scene we returned to
that intersection of town where

68079a91-bf9f-4f0d-8073-04ca7d2f8d02-1
01:14:05.332 --> 01:14:10.052
the old man had arrived to begin
with. Except that this time

68079a91-bf9f-4f0d-8073-04ca7d2f8d02-2
01:14:10.052 --> 01:14:14.540
everything is in color and
people once again are spending

68079a91-bf9f-4f0d-8073-04ca7d2f8d02-3
01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:19.570
time together. And it definitely
seems as if he is leaving town.

4dcad59c-4677-44c2-af37-24d3e9e7357b-0
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:28.882
And in this last scene we see
the man at the intersection of a

4dcad59c-4677-44c2-af37-24d3e9e7357b-1
01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:34.007
new place. This new place is
entirely in black and white and

4dcad59c-4677-44c2-af37-24d3e9e7357b-2
01:14:34.007 --> 01:14:38.964
he is standing in front of
another little house that has a

4dcad59c-4677-44c2-af37-24d3e9e7357b-3
01:14:38.964 --> 01:14:44.256
for sale sign in front of it.
And he's holding up some kind of

4dcad59c-4677-44c2-af37-24d3e9e7357b-4
01:14:44.256 --> 01:14:49.213
a diamond shaped object and
everyone's looking down at him

4dcad59c-4677-44c2-af37-24d3e9e7357b-5
01:14:49.213 --> 01:14:53.330
with suspicion and it looks as
if the neighbors.

35911984-8c9f-4779-8661-6d72f1d4f167-0
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.557
Of this House are the same
neighbors that he had before,

35911984-8c9f-4779-8661-6d72f1d4f167-1
01:14:57.557 --> 01:15:01.859
who moved rather than stay in
his Happy New World. And the

35911984-8c9f-4779-8661-6d72f1d4f167-2
01:15:01.859 --> 01:15:06.308
girl is looking down at him,
delighted to see him again, and

35911984-8c9f-4779-8661-6d72f1d4f167-3
01:15:06.308 --> 01:15:10.611
the parents very much the
opposite. But it looks as if the

35911984-8c9f-4779-8661-6d72f1d4f167-4
01:15:10.611 --> 01:15:14.987
story is going to continue in
this new town where he brings

35911984-8c9f-4779-8661-6d72f1d4f167-5
01:15:14.987 --> 01:15:17.540
color and togetherness once
again.

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-0
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.328
And in this scene, we see him
leaving that house. The girl is

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-1
01:15:25.328 --> 01:15:29.430
standing outside of the house
holding a colorful flower. She

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-2
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:33.868
herself is in color. And there's
a man looking on from the window

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-3
01:15:33.868 --> 01:15:38.239
who has also changed from black
and white to color. And they are

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-4
01:15:38.239 --> 01:15:42.475
both holding colorful flowers.
And then we see sort of like on

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-5
01:15:42.475 --> 01:15:46.778
the edge of this screen, the old
man carrying on and moving on.

5eacf648-534c-48f8-aaf9-509352485f48-6
01:15:46.778 --> 01:15:47.720
#END_flowerman

4ff60d14-f35e-4d43-80e0-62e4d55978b4-0
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.930
OK. Thank you. Let me see what.

8a31a623-070a-422e-b0cf-86e79b0bd65c-0
01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.150
We have next.

6fd3179f-bab5-48f9-9474-077c15900ee3-0
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:03.520
OK, we have another short story.

009cdd07-5df0-4f7b-9cbf-29a13f0fb596-0
01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.410
This one is 66 slides.

a6c8bb83-3b35-4988-82d7-651cea29edea-0
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:25.930
#START_arrival_6 OK. All right.
So we return to the sepia

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-0
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.865
Dystopian future world, fantasy
world. Alright, so in this scene

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-1
01:16:31.865 --> 01:16:36.115
we see a pot, it looks like it's
an empty pot, and then something

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-2
01:16:36.115 --> 01:16:39.850
alights on the side of the pot
like some kind of a winged

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-3
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:44.036
creature of some kind. And then
that creature kind of like bends

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-4
01:16:44.036 --> 01:16:48.157
forward and looks inside of the
pot and possibly falls into the

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-5
01:16:48.157 --> 01:16:52.278
pot. Because in the next scene
we see, you know, just maybe the

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-6
01:16:52.278 --> 01:16:56.142
part of a tail or something
peeking out from the pot behind

b89bb61a-65be-45cf-b27f-b4efafb2b04a-7
01:16:56.142 --> 01:16:57.430
the pot or possibly.

5c4c67c4-61e3-41da-bc6c-1f7edb595f50-0
01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.375
In a mirror view it's hard to
see, but yeah, like behind the

5c4c67c4-61e3-41da-bc6c-1f7edb595f50-1
01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:07.301
pot is somebody who's wearing a
waistcoat and long sleeve shirt

5c4c67c4-61e3-41da-bc6c-1f7edb595f50-2
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:12.304
dipping a pen into some kind of
an ink well with with a gas lamp

5c4c67c4-61e3-41da-bc6c-1f7edb595f50-3
01:17:12.304 --> 01:17:17.230
nearby so they begin to write in
the next scene. So we see them

5c4c67c4-61e3-41da-bc6c-1f7edb595f50-4
01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:21.310
writing on a piece of paper
using this fountain pen.

559182f5-1b53-4ce2-9860-bb74c08affdf-0
01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:26.117
And possibly in the foreground
of that scene looks to be like

559182f5-1b53-4ce2-9860-bb74c08affdf-1
01:17:26.117 --> 01:17:29.239
some money. So like some
currency bills just sitting on

559182f5-1b53-4ce2-9860-bb74c08affdf-2
01:17:29.239 --> 01:17:32.585
the paper. Sorry, sitting on the
countertop in front of the

559182f5-1b53-4ce2-9860-bb74c08affdf-3
01:17:32.585 --> 01:17:32.920
paper.

aa8a85cd-0163-4769-8f10-64d59af6d6c8-0
01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:37.810
Then once the once the writing
is complete, in the next scene

aa8a85cd-0163-4769-8f10-64d59af6d6c8-1
01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:41.997
we see the the person folding
the paper, and then in the scene

aa8a85cd-0163-4769-8f10-64d59af6d6c8-2
01:17:41.997 --> 01:17:46.051
following that it looks like
they've made a paper crane or a

aa8a85cd-0163-4769-8f10-64d59af6d6c8-3
01:17:46.051 --> 01:17:47.780
paper pigeon of some kind.

fdd903de-47f3-4f96-b192-14178f0f5e1a-0
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:56.027
And they then tuck that paper
bird into an envelope. And so

fdd903de-47f3-4f96-b192-14178f0f5e1a-1
01:17:56.027 --> 01:18:02.465
then, oh, then we see them
reaching into some kind of like

fdd903de-47f3-4f96-b192-14178f0f5e1a-2
01:18:02.465 --> 01:18:03.120
maybe.

8956bf20-aaf0-415c-8ceb-e5e0f388f9ae-0
01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.365
Wallet. No, no, it's the same
envelope. We see them putting

8956bf20-aaf0-415c-8ceb-e5e0f388f9ae-1
01:18:08.365 --> 01:18:12.634
the currency into the the same
envelope. So the paper crane or

8956bf20-aaf0-415c-8ceb-e5e0f388f9ae-2
01:18:12.634 --> 01:18:16.631
the paper bird plus a bunch of
money is put inside of this

8956bf20-aaf0-415c-8ceb-e5e0f388f9ae-3
01:18:16.631 --> 01:18:20.764
envelope, and then we see the
person's face as they lick the

8956bf20-aaf0-415c-8ceb-e5e0f388f9ae-4
01:18:20.764 --> 01:18:22.120
envelope to seal it.

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-0
01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.328
And then they put in the next
scene we see them putting a

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-1
01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:31.775
stamp on the envelope. Following
that we see that this must have

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-2
01:18:31.775 --> 01:18:35.402
been our protagonist from
before, because we see his

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-3
01:18:35.402 --> 01:18:39.370
companion, the mouse snake,
following him down the stairs

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-4
01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:43.749
with the shot is only from the
waist down, but he's holding the

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-5
01:18:43.749 --> 01:18:47.581
envelope that he just created.
He is now on the street,

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-6
01:18:47.581 --> 01:18:51.618
speaking with an older woman
who's wearing like a kerchief

7d11ee73-0ef3-45c4-bf65-31c69b1a3ea2-7
01:18:51.618 --> 01:18:52.850
over her head and.

bbc1ab81-bb05-4262-ab31-bc312a9ed9b8-0
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:57.830
He's holding up the envelope and
she is pointing off somewhere in

bbc1ab81-bb05-4262-ab31-bc312a9ed9b8-1
01:18:57.830 --> 01:19:02.165
the distance, so it's as if he's
asking her where he can go mail

bbc1ab81-bb05-4262-ab31-bc312a9ed9b8-2
01:19:02.165 --> 01:19:06.566
it and then in the next scene we
see some kind of like what looks

bbc1ab81-bb05-4262-ab31-bc312a9ed9b8-3
01:19:06.566 --> 01:19:08.700
like a post office box or like a

5094a0f9-a340-40c5-baac-16449530a527-0
01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:11.320
Mailbox.

710dfc18-83ec-4e2f-9d93-9d49dc4a076b-0
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.430
And it.

cc91e3f0-cb78-4d94-ab43-04d2927df24b-0
01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:20.832
Is just this square, rectangular
kind of cuboid shape, but with

cc91e3f0-cb78-4d94-ab43-04d2927df24b-1
01:19:20.832 --> 01:19:21.460
wings.

e34bc484-7c07-4de8-8350-673700469d6f-0
01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.033
It looks like there's like wings
coming out of it, just like

e34bc484-7c07-4de8-8350-673700469d6f-1
01:19:25.033 --> 01:19:25.320
flaps.

7de66b64-ea0c-42aa-b6fa-6626134e1a24-0
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:31.288
So he leans forward and he's
like, reading instructions on

7de66b64-ea0c-42aa-b6fa-6626134e1a24-1
01:19:31.288 --> 01:19:36.228
the front of the mailbox. And
then he pulls something on one

7de66b64-ea0c-42aa-b6fa-6626134e1a24-2
01:19:36.228 --> 01:19:40.925
of the there's like levers or
buttons on the front of the

7de66b64-ea0c-42aa-b6fa-6626134e1a24-3
01:19:40.925 --> 01:19:46.027
machine. He pulls one of them
out. A set of small doors on the

7de66b64-ea0c-42aa-b6fa-6626134e1a24-4
01:19:46.027 --> 01:19:51.210
front of the mailbox opens, and
he slips his letter inside. And

7de66b64-ea0c-42aa-b6fa-6626134e1a24-5
01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:56.070
then he looks upward because in
the next scene we see that.

02fa6912-9099-4571-9c86-2b42f8815f5c-0
01:19:56.140 --> 01:20:00.320
That mailbox has actually
started to fly, not because of

02fa6912-9099-4571-9c86-2b42f8815f5c-1
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.160
its wings, but because there's a
giant balloon that's attached to

02fa6912-9099-4571-9c86-2b42f8815f5c-2
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.853
the mailbox from above. So the
mailbox is attached via a string

02fa6912-9099-4571-9c86-2b42f8815f5c-3
01:20:09.853 --> 01:20:13.960
to just this giant round
balloon, and he begins to walk

02fa6912-9099-4571-9c86-2b42f8815f5c-4
01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.700
away, knowing that that mailbox
is now on its way.

1df21f7d-ec18-42c5-8000-cde3249ec720-0
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:24.825
Here we see the progression of a
plant. So it's it starts and

1df21f7d-ec18-42c5-8000-cde3249ec720-1
01:20:24.825 --> 01:20:28.607
we're looking at a leaf shape,
which is like a very simple

1df21f7d-ec18-42c5-8000-cde3249ec720-2
01:20:28.607 --> 01:20:32.070
design and then it starts to get
split in the middle.

75e05f6f-0678-4aae-86e9-071c61ca66d2-0
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:37.525
That splitting kind of
continues, and so now there's

75e05f6f-0678-4aae-86e9-071c61ca66d2-1
01:20:37.525 --> 01:20:40.890
like a prominent V, splitting
the leaf in half.

8b4dfa08-0d96-417e-86e7-b09d09e6772e-0
01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:48.341
And that continues to split open
as this stamen of a new plant

8b4dfa08-0d96-417e-86e7-b09d09e6772e-1
01:20:48.341 --> 01:20:53.710
kind of like emerges from the
center and that new.

fa57c816-a2fb-455e-9a1a-01ad21343438-0
01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.207
The new seedling continues to
expand as the the leaf shape on

fa57c816-a2fb-455e-9a1a-01ad21343438-1
01:21:00.207 --> 01:21:05.010
either sides continues to kind
of shrink down and shrivel.

8640d9de-f40b-418b-b26c-fbc83e72b3bb-0
01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:11.612
The the, the stamen looking
seedling then, you know, sprouts

8640d9de-f40b-418b-b26c-fbc83e72b3bb-1
01:21:11.612 --> 01:21:14.120
like this kind of bulbous.

bb1df328-f5db-43e0-913b-f4aacf2c1bfe-0
01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:20.087
And like top and then that
continues to grow. So now the

bb1df328-f5db-43e0-913b-f4aacf2c1bfe-1
01:21:20.087 --> 01:21:24.400
leaf shape that has been on
either side of this.

53f3bc6a-e563-4874-81b6-c3bef5fa3c4e-0
01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:30.763
Of this like stamen is now
completely disintegrated on the

53f3bc6a-e563-4874-81b6-c3bef5fa3c4e-1
01:21:30.763 --> 01:21:35.340
ground and what's left is a very
dandelion looking.

486c4e85-9f4b-405a-bc96-c9436ac783eb-0
01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.186
Stem with with a sort of like a
bulbous or spherical top and it

486c4e85-9f4b-405a-bc96-c9436ac783eb-1
01:21:42.186 --> 01:21:47.376
looks as if you know it's some
kind of like a flower that

486c4e85-9f4b-405a-bc96-c9436ac783eb-2
01:21:47.376 --> 01:21:52.477
continues to grow and get
incredibly large and dandelion

486c4e85-9f4b-405a-bc96-c9436ac783eb-3
01:21:52.477 --> 01:21:58.114
like and how feathery and and
large it is. And then it gets so

486c4e85-9f4b-405a-bc96-c9436ac783eb-4
01:21:58.114 --> 01:22:03.841
big it looks as if parts of it
do start to fly away like a like

486c4e85-9f4b-405a-bc96-c9436ac783eb-5
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:05.900
dandelions seeds would.

0786fa60-1453-419b-8e7b-770f1475adbf-0
01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:11.486
As the dandelion seeds float
away, what's left is something

0786fa60-1453-419b-8e7b-770f1475adbf-1
01:22:11.486 --> 01:22:12.380
that looks.

fdefc9f5-eb4a-4d41-b4f6-d1485c985192-0
01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:20.053
You know, it just continues to
look flower like kind of like a

fdefc9f5-eb4a-4d41-b4f6-d1485c985192-1
01:22:20.053 --> 01:22:26.361
Daisy and then after that there
are these small white, six small

fdefc9f5-eb4a-4d41-b4f6-d1485c985192-2
01:22:26.361 --> 01:22:31.310
white lines that appear inside
of the flower like.

af55c585-ee18-4aa0-b95c-4d6ab38bc461-0
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:33.300


7daf1115-ab0a-4081-b47c-db9df816ad2a-0
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:35.720
Plant that remains.

74270404-c2dd-4796-8205-62eb8837ab7e-0
01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:41.887
And then on this, on the scene
next, they continue to get

74270404-c2dd-4796-8205-62eb8837ab7e-1
01:22:41.887 --> 01:22:43.050
bigger like seeds.

d55e31c2-eed4-4b58-bdd4-4c1ff1182860-0
01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:47.819
So these seeds continue to get
bigger. Um, there's some flying

d55e31c2-eed4-4b58-bdd4-4c1ff1182860-1
01:22:47.819 --> 01:22:51.527
creatures which kind of appear.
Possibly they interact with the

d55e31c2-eed4-4b58-bdd4-4c1ff1182860-2
01:22:51.527 --> 01:22:53.150
flower, possibly they don't.

a3be56c8-4f83-4851-8606-a7fef9bc00ab-0
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:59.446
The seeds are now quite seed
like now and take up probably

a3be56c8-4f83-4851-8606-a7fef9bc00ab-1
01:22:59.446 --> 01:23:04.631
about like 10% of the plant
overall, maybe more than 10%

a3be56c8-4f83-4851-8606-a7fef9bc00ab-2
01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:05.450
like 30%.

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-0
01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:10.710
And then in the next scene we
see that these seeds are

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-1
01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:15.177
actually dropping to the ground.
So 3 seeds remain in the plant,

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-2
01:23:15.177 --> 01:23:19.163
3 seeds have dropped to the
ground and also on the ground

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-3
01:23:19.163 --> 01:23:23.700
with them are these kind of like
rodent tailed creatures that are

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-4
01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.755
possibly eating the seeds or
taking them away. In the next

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-5
01:23:27.755 --> 01:23:32.085
scene the plant which is kind of
a tree like flower like thing

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-6
01:23:32.085 --> 01:23:36.277
remains barren. There's no,
there's no seeds on the plant or

9463b967-d637-45fa-ac06-c984d7993fa8-7
01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:37.240
on the ground.

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-0
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:42.359
So I think that that part of the
tree's lifespan is over. The

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-1
01:23:42.359 --> 01:23:47.278
next scene is very similar, just
a little bit more bleak. And

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-2
01:23:47.278 --> 01:23:52.277
then the next scene we see the
tree like structure be begin to

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-3
01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:57.196
deteriorate. So all that's left
of the tree begins to sort of

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-4
01:23:57.196 --> 01:24:01.957
like disintegrate and fall
apart. And we see that happening

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-5
01:24:01.957 --> 01:24:06.638
in the next 4 scenes where the
solid structure of the tree

87f29764-a18e-42a7-bd89-ab5aa9c3edfb-6
01:24:06.638 --> 01:24:07.670
gives way to.

67b28f6d-1c90-4233-ac88-8036a7701209-0
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:09.250
More of a Lacy.

2b4a7f97-25fe-4187-8215-5ffc2707e45f-0
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:13.650
Skeletal structure that remains.

417c1b86-743d-493f-9a0e-8d05ba7a57a1-0
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.487
That looks kind of like a sand
dollar, like the under sand out

417c1b86-743d-493f-9a0e-8d05ba7a57a1-1
01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:19.480
of a sand dollar.

8097cf9c-dffb-45b3-841e-e8b812522f7b-0
01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.658
And we're entering a sort of a
winter season with snow on the

8097cf9c-dffb-45b3-841e-e8b812522f7b-1
01:24:25.658 --> 01:24:30.269
ground. Snow is falling. Now.
There's nothing left of the tree

8097cf9c-dffb-45b3-841e-e8b812522f7b-2
01:24:30.269 --> 01:24:35.027
at all, except for that skeletal
structure that just looks as if

8097cf9c-dffb-45b3-841e-e8b812522f7b-3
01:24:35.027 --> 01:24:38.980
the tree has gone like totally
dormant at this point.

7ccf346b-e7ea-49d1-8a3f-9d3818eb5a3d-0
01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:50.093
In this scene we have a bird's
eye view of like the center of a

7ccf346b-e7ea-49d1-8a3f-9d3818eb5a3d-1
01:24:50.093 --> 01:24:55.845
city, where we've got these
incredibly monolithic large

7ccf346b-e7ea-49d1-8a3f-9d3818eb5a3d-2
01:24:55.845 --> 01:25:02.008
architectural structures that
look very imposing. There are

7ccf346b-e7ea-49d1-8a3f-9d3818eb5a3d-3
01:25:02.008 --> 01:25:05.090
flying creatures and airships.

7a4e362e-8d7f-43c2-9f7d-d8b564578671-0
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:12.610
Around the scene on the ground,
you know, we see the, you know,

7a4e362e-8d7f-43c2-9f7d-d8b564578671-1
01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:17.812
very small lines indicating
people going up and down the

7a4e362e-8d7f-43c2-9f7d-d8b564578671-2
01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:18.360
roads.

65067529-1d59-4a0f-8d2e-933355d61153-0
01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:27.205
The architectural style is once
again reliant on just these

65067529-1d59-4a0f-8d2e-933355d61153-1
01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:34.135
large shapes. Cuboids, cones,
cylinders, all very basic

65067529-1d59-4a0f-8d2e-933355d61153-2
01:25:34.135 --> 01:25:39.210
fantasy like shapes for these
buildings.

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-0
01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:52.369
In that next scene we see the
what had been empty vessel, this

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-1
01:25:52.369 --> 01:25:56.310
pot and the flying creature
coming back to it. Except now

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-2
01:25:56.310 --> 01:26:00.318
when it approaches the pot,
these little heads pop out. So

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-3
01:26:00.318 --> 01:26:04.462
it's a flying creature that's
feeding some some babies, it's

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-4
01:26:04.462 --> 01:26:08.878
bringing something in it's beak
and it's kind of leaning forward

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-5
01:26:08.878 --> 01:26:13.226
to babies that are reaching up
with open mouths. So this flying

0e0fe2fe-333b-46c5-bbc7-d3c84b383c6c-6
01:26:13.226 --> 01:26:15.400
creature's taking care of those.

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-0
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:21.197
The next time we see the the
man, our protagonists sitting on

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-1
01:26:21.197 --> 01:26:25.787
a bed inside of a room, there's
lots of things happening in the

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-2
01:26:25.787 --> 01:26:30.020
room. He's got a he's got a
desk, he's got books, he's got

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-3
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.323
an oil lamp, he's hanging his
laundry out to dry. His snake

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-4
01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:38.627
mouse companion is on the bed
resting behind him. His shoes

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-5
01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:42.644
are on the ground, and he is
holding what looks to be a

22d9ace1-f4a4-4dc8-941d-72c4eaf82a88-6
01:26:42.644 --> 01:26:47.020
framed photograph in the next
scene where we get a close up.

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-0
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:51.452
Of his companion, who kind of
wakes up. He's sleeping. And

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-1
01:26:51.452 --> 01:26:55.889
then he wakes up with a start
and then he jumps off the bed

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-2
01:26:55.889 --> 01:26:59.882
and the man holding the
photograph kind of like looks

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-3
01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:04.615
over to the side wondering what
happened to his friend. And the

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-4
01:27:04.615 --> 01:27:08.756
the the animal kind of like
ducks out of sight down a a

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-5
01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:13.414
hatch in the floor. So it's it's
evident then that this man is

2d1d3869-21c2-4d85-b29c-a97802a65762-6
01:27:13.414 --> 01:27:17.259
staying in some kind of like an
attic room because.

b00990b6-1b9f-4d37-a21b-7866fc283478-0
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:21.702
You see like a step ladder or a
ladder coming out from from

b00990b6-1b9f-4d37-a21b-7866fc283478-1
01:27:21.702 --> 01:27:25.992
underneath this hole in the
ground. So then we see the man

b00990b6-1b9f-4d37-a21b-7866fc283478-2
01:27:25.992 --> 01:27:27.810
climbing down the ladder.

9fc6436e-c5fc-42fa-a57b-9de09477dfb5-0
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:34.770
Going after his companion and
the animal creature is now.

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-0
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:40.308
Looking at a envelope on the
ground. Above the envelope is

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-1
01:27:40.308 --> 01:27:44.946
probably the mail slot through
which it was slid, so he's

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-2
01:27:44.946 --> 01:27:50.065
probably at the front door. The
creature looks up with worry as

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-3
01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:54.863
the man reaches down to take
hold of the envelope. The man,

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-4
01:27:54.863 --> 01:27:59.741
we see his face and his hands
open the envelope, and then he

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-5
01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:04.700
pulls out a bird, so it's the
paper bird, and then he unfolds

3706e571-fcad-4648-938d-a4f4cb19433e-6
01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:05.419
the bird.

cd510368-664c-4b72-8910-124b771c71c8-0
01:28:05.490 --> 01:28:10.627
And he sees the message and he
now is looking out the window,

cd510368-664c-4b72-8910-124b771c71c8-1
01:28:10.627 --> 01:28:15.600
probably wondering how that how
the letter even got to him.

19110ee8-3914-4bf5-8527-8d310a72627f-0
01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:26.611
And now we see a couple of
different scenes. The 1st is a

19110ee8-3914-4bf5-8527-8d310a72627f-1
01:28:26.611 --> 01:28:32.990
folded paper version of his
mouse Snake creature pet.

c247386f-1046-48b2-84cf-22d39d8d9190-0
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:38.790
The second is some kind of
conical um.

77fb5cbd-68b1-4377-a47c-074d2d3a7490-0
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:42.520
Once again, like the
astronomical clock looks like a

77fb5cbd-68b1-4377-a47c-074d2d3a7490-1
01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.870
sun in front of a sun.

953dcd71-1200-49fc-baea-86eb3135fd48-0
01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:49.196
That's like a mechanical object
that probably is for telling

953dcd71-1200-49fc-baea-86eb3135fd48-1
01:28:49.196 --> 01:28:49.540
time.

dc0459d1-f8b2-4bb2-9169-60c76bcc2e3f-0
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:55.363
The next scene is a hat on a hat
rack, next to maybe what looks

dc0459d1-f8b2-4bb2-9169-60c76bcc2e3f-1
01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:59.170
to be a handkerchief with some
patterns on it.

accaad24-89c4-44aa-b4ea-469c1307d22b-0
01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:06.059
In the next scene we see a bowl
with some of the strange food

accaad24-89c4-44aa-b4ea-469c1307d22b-1
01:29:06.059 --> 01:29:11.059
items he had acquired from
before. Next we see a child's

accaad24-89c4-44aa-b4ea-469c1307d22b-2
01:29:11.059 --> 01:29:16.410
drawing of one of the airships
that we had seen from before.

accaad24-89c4-44aa-b4ea-469c1307d22b-3
01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:21.937
And behind that, once again an
astronomical, you know, kind of

accaad24-89c4-44aa-b4ea-469c1307d22b-4
01:29:21.937 --> 01:29:25.709
a drawing of like a sun over top
of a sun.

c2e7b8f1-bcff-4eb7-ad6c-81efc42631f0-0
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:32.518
Next to that is some kind of
mechanical device that looks

c2e7b8f1-bcff-4eb7-ad6c-81efc42631f0-1
01:29:32.518 --> 01:29:38.037
like it's like a clockwork or a
spring key mechanism of some

c2e7b8f1-bcff-4eb7-ad6c-81efc42631f0-2
01:29:38.037 --> 01:29:38.490
kind.

bea350fa-32aa-465c-860b-4495d5e01580-0
01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.130
Then we see like a cup of coffee
or a cup of hot beverage on top

bea350fa-32aa-465c-860b-4495d5e01580-1
01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:44.460
of a.

5b242126-d8d0-4537-83d8-db0cf9c0286e-0
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:47.560
Uh.

fc08587a-7473-400a-9cb4-b60fd39d79e3-0
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:50.730
It's on a, you know,

7a1971c2-0a5c-4ab4-b4ba-80dbe0156c23-0
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:57.690
It's it's a it's a teacup on a
saucer on top of maybe what

7a1971c2-0a5c-4ab4-b4ba-80dbe0156c23-1
01:29:57.690 --> 01:30:02.935
looks to be a newspaper. Then we
see a scene with a family. It's

7a1971c2-0a5c-4ab4-b4ba-80dbe0156c23-2
01:30:02.935 --> 01:30:07.938
like it's a man, it's a woman
and looks to be like a a child,

7a1971c2-0a5c-4ab4-b4ba-80dbe0156c23-3
01:30:07.938 --> 01:30:09.230
but like a girl.

1a9482f9-328b-4306-9bd7-adc7ca6b0902-0
01:30:10.630 --> 01:30:16.575
And then we see a scene where
there's an older male hand with

1a9482f9-328b-4306-9bd7-adc7ca6b0902-1
01:30:16.575 --> 01:30:20.220
a coin that's giving it to a
smaller.

84b3ae76-5754-48b5-b338-2ffac2d1ac5a-0
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.949
a smaller child's hand. But then
we still see that teacup on top

84b3ae76-5754-48b5-b338-2ffac2d1ac5a-1
01:30:25.949 --> 01:30:26.230
of a.

3a525560-02c5-4e67-867e-4f659a36f39c-0
01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:28.410
Newspaper in the background.

8791dfe7-39cb-44d2-8a9b-6c1554e9e2a8-0
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.565
So in the next scene we see the
overall picture of everything

8791dfe7-39cb-44d2-8a9b-6c1554e9e2a8-1
01:30:38.565 --> 01:30:44.299
pulling together from what we
saw from before. So we've got

8791dfe7-39cb-44d2-8a9b-6c1554e9e2a8-2
01:30:44.299 --> 01:30:49.938
the the paper, the origami
version of the the pet, the the

8791dfe7-39cb-44d2-8a9b-6c1554e9e2a8-3
01:30:49.938 --> 01:30:54.430
picture of the family, the
astronomical clock.

4cfc1e6b-a80d-48ba-992b-9b0b97ce4d07-0
01:30:55.610 --> 01:31:00.860
So we've we've got the man and
his child and and his wife, and

4cfc1e6b-a80d-48ba-992b-9b0b97ce4d07-1
01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:05.860
he's holding up the number 3 as
he's giving her some coins.

1c35dc4f-f16e-4c7d-a8b7-4ec2fe860be5-0
01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:11.182
And they're all sitting at a
table and having breakfast

1c35dc4f-f16e-4c7d-a8b7-4ec2fe860be5-1
01:31:11.182 --> 01:31:14.651
together or some kind of a meal
together. It looks like she's

1c35dc4f-f16e-4c7d-a8b7-4ec2fe860be5-2
01:31:14.651 --> 01:31:15.770
wearing a nightgown.

0730ce85-6ea8-4441-a57f-703fe37585bb-0
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:21.839
In the next scene, she's pulling
some some boots on and then we

0730ce85-6ea8-4441-a57f-703fe37585bb-1
01:31:21.839 --> 01:31:26.277
see her hand reaching towards
the the pet snake mouse creature

0730ce85-6ea8-4441-a57f-703fe37585bb-2
01:31:26.277 --> 01:31:30.716
who has something in his mouth.
So maybe like a hat or item of

0730ce85-6ea8-4441-a57f-703fe37585bb-3
01:31:30.716 --> 01:31:35.366
clothing. Oh, it's a hat because
then we see that she's pulling a

0730ce85-6ea8-4441-a57f-703fe37585bb-4
01:31:35.366 --> 01:31:35.859
hat on.

866ffa68-1665-4b1e-80af-c5174d706dde-0
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:38.010
Over top of her head.

ac0e6fb1-d6f2-47aa-b66b-62266f5a1174-0
01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:43.062
And then in the next scene we
see her. It's like an exterior

ac0e6fb1-d6f2-47aa-b66b-62266f5a1174-1
01:31:43.062 --> 01:31:47.660
shot, so she's outside. We see
the House that they probably are

ac0e6fb1-d6f2-47aa-b66b-62266f5a1174-2
01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:52.259
living in in the background or
the apartment, and she's running

ac0e6fb1-d6f2-47aa-b66b-62266f5a1174-3
01:31:52.259 --> 01:31:56.570
down some stairs with some mouse
snake sort of at her side.

2372c011-a56f-4997-97e1-638414225500-0
01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:01.432
And then in the next few scenes
we see her sort of running

2372c011-a56f-4997-97e1-638414225500-1
01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:05.168
alongside the pet, and then
she's reaching down. We see them

2372c011-a56f-4997-97e1-638414225500-2
01:32:05.168 --> 01:32:08.903
both looking down below on the
ground at a couple of glowing

2372c011-a56f-4997-97e1-638414225500-3
01:32:08.903 --> 01:32:12.699
objects. She's pointing at one,
and then the mouse is kind of

2372c011-a56f-4997-97e1-638414225500-4
01:32:12.699 --> 01:32:16.251
like looking on as she's
pointing at it, and then then in

2372c011-a56f-4997-97e1-638414225500-5
01:32:16.251 --> 01:32:17.170
the next scene.

99f19213-adca-4894-aaf9-fb5c05969932-0
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.702
She's surrounded by those
glowing fireflies, so it's like

99f19213-adca-4894-aaf9-fb5c05969932-1
01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:25.386
they lifted off of the ground
and started glowing around her

99f19213-adca-4894-aaf9-fb5c05969932-2
01:32:25.386 --> 01:32:27.560
after that happened.
#END_arrival_6

ef3f2225-f32c-4341-ad05-680d7a940f31-0
01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:35.340
OK.

c436a298-ae06-437e-b4ab-2ab9ba99f235-0
01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:36.720
Umm.

ed6914e8-4abe-4ce8-a100-f9dce615b368-0
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:40.080
So let me just.
