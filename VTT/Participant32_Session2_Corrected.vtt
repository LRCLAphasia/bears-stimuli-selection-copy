00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.853
OK, so today we're starting off
with a complex scene. So with

f7cdb138-2a3a-4520-8a91-e1ebb3f4093f-1
00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:10.429
complex scenes like we were
doing last time, I tried to take

f7cdb138-2a3a-4520-8a91-e1ebb3f4093f-2
00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.004
3 to 5 minutes to describe what
you see in the scene and I'm

f7cdb138-2a3a-4520-8a91-e1ebb3f4093f-3
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:15.470
going to share my screen.

7d68ad0a-ac2d-42f9-9aa9-63953d3ad6f4-0
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.365
OK. Can you see my screen? Yes.
OK, perfect. So you could begin

7d68ad0a-ac2d-42f9-9aa9-63953d3ad6f4-1
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:26.720
when you're ready.

eab6954f-2385-4318-8409-58fd71fa93e1-0
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.280
OK.

3f97434a-6ad1-4932-bd84-c3362cf41509-0
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.730
Umm.

e4b7b99d-a5b6-48b1-b1a5-7159f7db47f6-0
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.569
#START_waldo_1 It looks like a
where's Waldo? Scene of

e4b7b99d-a5b6-48b1-b1a5-7159f7db47f6-1
00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:40.605
somewhere, most likely in
Europe. There's the main Plaza

e4b7b99d-a5b6-48b1-b1a5-7159f7db47f6-2
00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:45.199
that's triangle. Triangle that
triangularly shaped.

e40f3621-dfa6-49f1-a777-5e5f37fab2ba-0
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.860
With a fountain in the middle.

e7c1af9b-5bcc-446e-b42f-72d24532108b-0
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.775
And with water shooting on the
fountain and on top of the

e7c1af9b-5bcc-446e-b42f-72d24532108b-1
00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:57.240
fountain it's a man with the
goggles or with a.

779ea381-cf30-4258-8ffa-9457ccec84ef-0
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.660
A mask and fins.

d59a353b-e501-4ae5-9403-ced21182b4fe-0
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.056
Looks like he should be scuba
diving. There are people walking

d59a353b-e501-4ae5-9403-ced21182b4fe-1
00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:12.138
all around. Also within the
triangle within the Plaza is an

d59a353b-e501-4ae5-9403-ced21182b4fe-2
00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:17.136
Archer from ancient Rome and
driving on the streets around

d59a353b-e501-4ae5-9403-ced21182b4fe-3
00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.000
this triangular Plaza.

f9bd61d4-92da-45f7-8e03-5f36edccf5d2-0
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.017

colored cars. Volkswagen Bugs

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:30.212
green, blue. There's a yellow
truck, a red car, a Gray car.

f9bd61d4-92da-45f7-8e03-5f36edccf5d2-2
00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:35.666
There are. There's a main pink
building with a green carpet in

f9bd61d4-92da-45f7-8e03-5f36edccf5d2-3

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.556
Off the front and then all the
windows around the pink

70d816cd-a0de-4f20-8ea2-4e507064e784-1
00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.310
Quite a lot. There are little
flower boxes at each window.

2dfb9761-18e4-4045-807c-0ba02bf72cd5-0
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.850
There is a house or a building
on another corner of the Plaza

2dfb9761-18e4-4045-807c-0ba02bf72cd5-1
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.370

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.610
I can't tell what they have.
They're fighting with either

38de2fcf-49d6-4a30-ae60-19232ddaf566-1
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.210
mops or and then buckets on
their head.

442f7bf4-301b-4fb5-a94b-4ba186dcb1f8-0
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.640
On the roof of the building.

a69d8410-b953-411d-ba83-521cea002807-0
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.410
At street level, there are other
vendors.

9db74c23-d10e-4b63-a0ff-e04f1fc3c25b-0
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.560
With red and white.

b571bec4-b0f9-4653-9fbe-7ae3a4287778-0
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.588
vending tables or red and white
awnings covering their vending

b571bec4-b0f9-4653-9fbe-7ae3a4287778-1
00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:31.372
tables that people are milling
around and buying plants or

b571bec4-b0f9-4653-9fbe-7ae3a4287778-2
00:02:31.372 --> 00:02:36.237
food. There's another building
on another corner that looks

b571bec4-b0f9-4653-9fbe-7ae3a4287778-3
00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:37.210
like a bank.

01df87d2-419b-4b7e-947d-b3c1bd871234-0
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.310
Walking up some stairs through
the door.

1dd01156-36e3-44a9-948a-bf171413e232-0
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.220
There's a veranda with a.

bffff247-103c-41cf-95f8-09aeeb582159-0
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.920
Figure on the roof.

9d51c069-9a87-4c06-bb8d-54fccfaa465c-0
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.410
Umm.

62cd6423-062c-4981-bcf4-2e7a49cc5141-0
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.399
And the rest of the scene is
mostly just people walking

62cd6423-062c-4981-bcf4-2e7a49cc5141-1
00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:58.640
around. There are a number of
streets in different directions.

5a289793-814e-4ad0-b33d-912383610bf1-0
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.660
But it's a very colorful scene
and lots of people. And then

5a289793-814e-4ad0-b33d-912383610bf1-1
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.899
with ladders, cleaning windows
and buildings, people on roofs

5a289793-814e-4ad0-b33d-912383610bf1-2
00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.350
walking around chasing a cat.

d1257621-8ed1-4872-a12c-7efce1fda39f-0
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.947
Then fixing things on the roof,
maybe air conditioning systems

d1257621-8ed1-4872-a12c-7efce1fda39f-1
00:03:18.947 --> 00:03:19.170
or.

c11c8f79-2a4b-4a5c-a877-ab2e77bf9127-0
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.730
Whatever it is they're doing.

b62d4228-5654-4741-8965-e641cfa7065c-0
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.120
That's it. #END_waldo_1

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.840
OK.

b359bfd0-da95-4a9a-bc12-69ed678a266b-0
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.480
OK, next is.

23070b03-a40f-46c4-8001-980962d14c38-0
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.270
The short story.

893583d4-2a05-4bb2-8c5b-94355460146d-0
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.658
So like last last time, when
you're done describing the one

893583d4-2a05-4bb2-8c5b-94355460146d-1
00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:09.250
page, you could ask me to move
on to the next page.

c4e7aea7-35fa-4242-9057-8b8d61d54f51-0
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.560
It's loading, Sir.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.629
Does this have a time, a time
frame? I forget. So the stories

fad04f9f-c4e3-4b64-b4b0-9f02635f5231-1
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.465
kind of just depend because like
some of them have like way more

fad04f9f-c4e3-4b64-b4b0-9f02635f5231-2
00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:30.183
slides than others, usually like
between 10 to 15 minutes. But

fad04f9f-c4e3-4b64-b4b0-9f02635f5231-3
00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:33.783
some stories that are really
short, it'll be like probably a

fad04f9f-c4e3-4b64-b4b0-9f02635f5231-4
00:04:33.783 --> 00:04:37.501
little less than that. And you
just want me to tell this story

fad04f9f-c4e3-4b64-b4b0-9f02635f5231-5
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:40.865
or just describe this. So
describe what you see and what

fad04f9f-c4e3-4b64-b4b0-9f02635f5231-6
00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.399
is happening in the story.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.340
Still loading OK.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.670
OK.

99435c64-2ea6-4818-bc9b-1bd3bcca8f4e-0
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.730
I'm just going to grab it. Oh
yeah.

c180cc89-21cc-4f01-a38c-94d2dd317ca9-0
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.510

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.630

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.030

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.130
Yep, you could start. OK.

Umm.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.669
Parts. They're laid out in three
sections, 3,3 squares with

1515da36-a845-4494-bd3e-c2596d7fffc8-1
00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.460
pictures in them on the 1st.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.200
Well, it's a cube.

1019a0f9-b7ff-4016-b580-70143a0e6fc3-0
00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.431
With three cubes, 3 cubes and
three cubes. Um the first three

1019a0f9-b7ff-4016-b580-70143a0e6fc3-1
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:05.743
on the top. In the first one
there's a picture of a family, a

1019a0f9-b7ff-4016-b580-70143a0e6fc3-2
00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:11.055
young girl and her parents. In
the second picture, there is a

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:16.367
hand lifting up the picture of
the family that was sitting up

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:21.765
on a mantle. And then the third
picture there's a it's showing

1019a0f9-b7ff-4016-b580-70143a0e6fc3-5
00:08:21.765 --> 00:08:26.905
two hands, the hands of a person
folding the picture into a

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.846
The 4th picture is on the 2nd
row down of this cube of nine

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:33.580

Although there's steam coming

00:11:38.727 --> 00:11:40.380

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:32.632
or the suitcase and the parents
are standing on each side of the

29a06a7e-0eb0-4ead-a3a8-b5e059ebbc0e-2
00:13:32.632 --> 00:13:37.939

anticipating or excited about

a83412b7-51e4-4f8a-872e-ad6512563c9a-1
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:46.480
what's to happen. Someone's

steaming so they're hot. And

43791842-5d18-4371-a0ae-7e39900c4466-2
00:14:01.824 --> 00:14:06.156
then there is the money or
passport or something sitting on

43791842-5d18-4371-a0ae-7e39900c4466-3
00:14:06.156 --> 00:14:07.240

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.583

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.390
And she looks to the left of
her.

3eb1d9ec-a410-422e-a9b1-98b95922e4ac-0
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.390

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.406
The picture. The next picture
shows the suitcase. So she's

586ad9d1-f844-4ba9-bcc5-f6f63c8c18d4-1
00:15:26.406 --> 00:15:29.825
probably looking at the suitcase

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.983
Gone down out the door, down

This.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.366
The first page that we're

father's hand and she's looking
up.

84f6fed6-5fbc-4dae-9c41-d74a4048b020-0
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.958

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.060
And then it shows her looking to
the left.

48c1e50c-9c91-47fc-b0c0-88674f9903a4-0
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.820

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.676
The person who's holding her
left hands, so she's in between

20be4337-7c6e-4023-be8f-9169021e6ee7-1
00:17:25.676 --> 00:17:29.510
two people, she's holding I
guess her parents' hands still.

7f502e42-cc3b-4850-829b-725430980ceb-0
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.685

00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:39.980
train station and it looks as
though they've they're standing

7f502e42-cc3b-4850-829b-725430980ceb-2
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.276
there waiting for the train and
there are other people around

7f502e42-cc3b-4850-829b-725430980ceb-3
00:17:44.276 --> 00:17:48.502
them with luggage, also waiting
for the train that's pulling

7f502e42-cc3b-4850-829b-725430980ceb-4
00:17:48.502 --> 00:17:49.680
into the station.

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-0
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.505
Um it's a steam train or a coal
burning train. There's a lot of

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-1
00:17:55.505 --> 00:18:00.436
smoke coming out of the stack of
the or the the steam engine. On

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-2
00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:04.988
the bottom row of pictures,
there are three. The girl looks

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-3
00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:09.691
worried and her father has his
hand on her shoulder and she's

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-4
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:14.622
looking up at him. And the next
picture shows him lifting up his

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-5
00:18:14.622 --> 00:18:19.174
hat and the folded bird is on
his head under his hat and he

0d2e48a6-9abb-42a6-abb3-40091c7525c1-6
00:18:19.174 --> 00:18:20.539
takes it down and.

Hands it to his daughter and she
holds it.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.972
And he whispers in her ear that
this is his gift to her as he's

678d72ce-9b41-4eb3-acac-3c5991b65064-1
00:18:27.972 --> 00:18:29.500
leaving, and to remember him.

d0dfb12d-f9f4-40b2-ba5d-c4af19a2cf0d-0
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.130
By it. And this is on the next
page. So she takes the bird and

d0dfb12d-f9f4-40b2-ba5d-c4af19a2cf0d-1
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.530
he gives her a hug.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.228
And she looks at him and she
looks at her mother. In the next

her handkerchief.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.687
And giving her husband a hug.
She's obviously sad, she doesn't

a11a8b75-18d1-4a63-b246-42434f6d12b8-1

he'll see her soon, and he takes
the suitcase and climbs up into

a11a8b75-18d1-4a63-b246-42434f6d12b8-3
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:26.320

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.800

the window.

a595b937-5970-4400-9907-ae172724d485-0
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.963

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.810
Actually 3 rows of windows and
in each row there are.

851ee18e-cd6f-4888-88dd-87baa6c52ae5-0
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.840
At least four Windows.

a805f283-350d-42f2-a753-caff72395cfd-0
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.800
That there are different scenes
in the windows.

cd81c2ab-ab78-4a71-9062-15fae73d0233-0
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.191
And the middle picture as it
comes out further shows that

cd81c2ab-ab78-4a71-9062-15fae73d0233-1
00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:38.872
these are windows on a boat.
That's the steamliner, and in

cd81c2ab-ab78-4a71-9062-15fae73d0233-2
00:22:38.872 --> 00:22:43.711
each window there's a scene
taking place of an an individual

cd81c2ab-ab78-4a71-9062-15fae73d0233-3
00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:48.630
doing something. Finally, the
last picture on the bottom row,

on the water.

eb24eae3-e1c1-4139-91e0-d366ec782139-0
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.730
Taking people somewhere.

Alright, let me see.

e267b81e-a7a2-4726-b9ca-cb2a40cd58f7-0
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.560
And next is a complex scene.

ab5d3d30-5ced-4c11-846c-70ed32d32b63-0
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.796
OK, so this is just the scenes
to describe what you see

ab5d3d30-5ced-4c11-846c-70ed32d32b63-1
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:43.060
happening in the scene.

f062b210-d60c-42cb-b1f7-d9555bb469e0-0
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:44.360
OK.

402e03f0-43da-4708-baf5-6847a61872d9-0
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.270
#START_campsite So this is a
scene.

dca27093-39b3-4ec7-a6dd-2d5d0900e04d-0
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.780
Um, it's another where's Waldo
scene?

cc7554b2-b5cc-4881-bff6-2695c0d10a44-0
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.250
And.

fcdf5cad-ed04-49e0-9c71-3b43d308db6d-0
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.360
The picture is separated by a
river.

04ff2e15-306a-4e6a-943e-746fbb4c0c6b-0
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.850
On the lower part of the river.

269fc6fa-327b-4e2b-a1ed-4e863f00156d-0
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.260
It's a scene of mostly.

ae8b6cd4-cee3-43f4-adac-5b943a9a7dbd-0

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:16.720
More.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.000
Umm.

d96d149d-2b73-44fb-ab0c-b05530afd02d-0
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.630
I'm trying to think of the word.

f15ac468-9298-4b5c-ac2d-06eb958c99e5-0
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:28.330
Less elegant types of outdoor
activities.

fd8e8ccb-177a-44cc-bb90-8c6655e2660d-0
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:36.880
There are tents, teepees, lots
of fabric.

83078443-9c65-4bb9-b5c3-c7eaf35c7837-0
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.475
Lean-to's and places where
people are inhabiting. It looks

83078443-9c65-4bb9-b5c3-c7eaf35c7837-1
00:24:43.475 --> 00:24:48.657
like they're out camping, having
a good time, people around

83078443-9c65-4bb9-b5c3-c7eaf35c7837-2
00:24:48.657 --> 00:24:53.580
campfires and enjoying the
water, fishing, walking along

83078443-9c65-4bb9-b5c3-c7eaf35c7837-3
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.480
paths. There are some.

4da532a1-d938-4d95-a806-6c7877f13f3f-0
00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.055
Areas of green that are
surrounded by bushes and a

4da532a1-d938-4d95-a806-6c7877f13f3f-1
00:25:01.055 --> 00:25:06.607
fence, where a bull and a donkey
are enclosed and some animals

4da532a1-d938-4d95-a806-6c7877f13f3f-2
00:25:06.607 --> 00:25:12.072
are enclosed. And there are some
people inside the enclosure,

4da532a1-d938-4d95-a806-6c7877f13f3f-3
00:25:12.072 --> 00:25:15.510
someone who's doing like a bull
fight.

6a972f1c-04fa-45e2-8026-3051154773b8-0
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.745
With the bull, has a red, they
have a red cape in their hands

6a972f1c-04fa-45e2-8026-3051154773b8-1
00:25:19.745 --> 00:25:22.580
and people are worried that
they're going to get hurt.

87f05b3f-188a-4f8b-83d5-e9332315c7fd-0
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.736
There are hikers and people that
are walking up and down the

87f05b3f-188a-4f8b-83d5-e9332315c7fd-1
00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:30.140
road.

d4d935df-5c95-45d0-867d-2bdc9c6682dc-0
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.566
And so on the one side, the
lower side of the river, you

d4d935df-5c95-45d0-867d-2bdc9c6682dc-1
00:25:36.566 --> 00:25:41.538
have lots of campers and hippie
type people. You have people

d4d935df-5c95-45d0-867d-2bdc9c6682dc-2
00:25:41.538 --> 00:25:46.265
blowing up their their raft to
go into the water, lots of

d4d935df-5c95-45d0-867d-2bdc9c6682dc-3
00:25:46.265 --> 00:25:49.200
children and people looking
around.

f89acb57-c88a-4905-878b-701c3b79ae78-0
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.960
Just enjoying their time and
their tents.

3654c50c-f50f-4de4-96a5-47a265a4c2db-0
00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.555
And then you have a bridge where
people are coming and going and

3654c50c-f50f-4de4-96a5-47a265a4c2db-1
00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:04.696
walking over the bridge to the
other side of the river, the

3654c50c-f50f-4de4-96a5-47a265a4c2db-2
00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:07.940
upper part of the page, where
you have a more.

62f328b1-20d9-4887-8757-bbf0ce2e3804-0
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:15.070
Modern scene of campers. People
in.

031850a4-9df6-4327-ba91-95c4a3b35d3e-0
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.730


7b387e27-4549-4f41-b9f5-c40986ebc932-0
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.060
Their

bd87de2a-7bd4-4dba-a37b-eacdf2884e92-0
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.030
Camping.

82f2604e-3f4d-479e-9dd2-01b91e2e4b51-0
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.250
I guess the only best way to say
it is campers.

cb51f4e2-f10a-4b01-8303-b24b5fc9aecb-0
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:31.454
So they have, you know, modern
amenities such as running water

cb51f4e2-f10a-4b01-8303-b24b5fc9aecb-1
00:26:31.454 --> 00:26:35.964
and probably a toilets, and
they've got an awning. One

cb51f4e2-f10a-4b01-8303-b24b5fc9aecb-2
00:26:35.964 --> 00:26:40.801
camper has an awning where the
people can sit under it and

cb51f4e2-f10a-4b01-8303-b24b5fc9aecb-3
00:26:40.801 --> 00:26:45.719
covers the door so that if it's
raining they won't get wet.

fe5d3d21-f781-43ca-aa76-003653a02833-0
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.850
You have.

05c4fc88-7b22-44b2-93b5-78c9c92e4236-0
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:53.443
Multi colored campers. There's a
pink one and a blue one and a

05c4fc88-7b22-44b2-93b5-78c9c92e4236-1
00:26:53.443 --> 00:26:54.100
green one.

9e8e6edd-90c7-4d18-a2fe-8bc00faa688d-0
00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:03.748
And the campsite is bordered by
a bunch of bushes, so it kind of

9e8e6edd-90c7-4d18-a2fe-8bc00faa688d-1
00:27:03.748 --> 00:27:04.450
keeps.

309890f1-5164-49b6-841d-999b6ca1f7e4-0
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.320
The other people out.

8cf5a038-2e62-4ccb-ba8e-a72c38ace0ca-0
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.774
So you don't have the number,
same number of people in this

8cf5a038-2e62-4ccb-ba8e-a72c38ace0ca-1
00:27:12.774 --> 00:27:15.510
campsite as you do in the
campsite that

629354a5-ac35-429e-98d0-dd05c42dafde-0
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.033
Where the tents are and and
people are coming and going and

629354a5-ac35-429e-98d0-dd05c42dafde-1
00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:21.130
jumping in the water.

95cdfd83-547d-4876-a9d5-c5d8b87e151f-0
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.770
The one that the.

324878d1-88b5-4e8b-8d12-401045c19ab2-0
00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.211
The camper side, there's a
walkway along the water where a

324878d1-88b5-4e8b-8d12-401045c19ab2-1
00:27:29.211 --> 00:27:33.380
lot of people are just milling
around. There's a biker.

132e6d43-0949-4127-b10f-020709f07772-0
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:39.257
There are people sitting on the
wall, dangling their feet over

132e6d43-0949-4127-b10f-020709f07772-1
00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:44.126
over the wall into the water or
close to the water. There's a

132e6d43-0949-4127-b10f-020709f07772-2
00:27:44.126 --> 00:27:48.995
man sitting on the wall fishing.
There's some people swimming

132e6d43-0949-4127-b10f-020709f07772-3
00:27:48.995 --> 00:27:53.942
with the fish and there's a big
boat in the middle with people

132e6d43-0949-4127-b10f-020709f07772-4
00:27:53.942 --> 00:27:56.220
in bathing suits and getting.

2a40457d-bf2a-4430-be80-7db14418f898-0
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.410
Ready to dive in the water.
Underneath the bridge, the

2a40457d-bf2a-4430-be80-7db14418f898-1
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.420
arched bridge that goes from one
side to the other.

bd461ad0-da0d-41b9-acdb-a62c629fa545-0
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.070
There's a.

4430d61c-2e73-469d-8d24-a378cb195dfb-0
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.820
There's there are three people
in a canoe.

ca23aca4-b5de-458d-a257-b0e07ee5b32c-0
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:17.435
Umm, it looks actually more like
a raft and someone is standing

ca23aca4-b5de-458d-a257-b0e07ee5b32c-1
00:28:17.435 --> 00:28:19.010
on it pushing it.

cfecc449-d932-423d-a548-1e48260c1900-0
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.820
With a long pole.

76f35f75-d566-419a-b20c-13aba667769f-0
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.060
And so they're heading down the
river actually towards the where

76f35f75-d566-419a-b20c-13aba667769f-1
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.310
people are jumping off.

e29213d0-eaa3-4fb6-a7aa-1071e3e43000-0
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.930
Umm.

4ec350af-4de4-47a9-aaa2-0245bb3e7b76-0
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.140
And.

478f2b9c-a041-452e-ad54-35b12921f1f9-0
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.190
There are also.

58fbbff9-6b31-48bb-9782-91217e4b19a1-0
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.217
Let's see. There's a group of
scuba divers practicing their

58fbbff9-6b31-48bb-9782-91217e4b19a1-1
00:28:41.217 --> 00:28:44.442
swimming on land, heading
towards crawling towards the

58fbbff9-6b31-48bb-9782-91217e4b19a1-2
00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:48.136
river. Not really sure what that
is, but they're laying on the

58fbbff9-6b31-48bb-9782-91217e4b19a1-3
00:28:48.136 --> 00:28:51.888
ground. Or maybe they're thirsty
and they're just trying to get

58fbbff9-6b31-48bb-9782-91217e4b19a1-4
00:28:51.888 --> 00:28:53.530
to the water to get a drink.

4f2777bc-a501-4d71-a831-3ae036817365-0
00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.444

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.840
Canvas tents across the river

4bcbcf94-6e71-4df7-bcc5-1f023274db9a-0
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.260

Umm.

67f9ed2d-3560-4182-9055-a2f7de58864d-0
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.390
#START_birthday_party_fun I read
the title. It's a page that says

67f9ed2d-3560-4182-9055-a2f7de58864d-1

00:30:08.804 --> 00:30:14.301
like a really fun birthday. So
somebody's having a birthday

The first page people are
entering.

2e5e5a11-a6d9-48d1-85b3-7f14f500366e-0
00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.980
And as you enter the yard.

699545e9-99e8-4f43-8f8a-b97ffb3b1250-0
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.745
Right on the left hand side
there. First of all, there are

699545e9-99e8-4f43-8f8a-b97ffb3b1250-1
00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:40.544
balloons at the gate, so you
know that there's a party there

699545e9-99e8-4f43-8f8a-b97ffb3b1250-2
00:30:40.544 --> 00:30:44.655

have gifts. And as you enter the
yard, there's a big table that

699545e9-99e8-4f43-8f8a-b97ffb3b1250-4

df5a9d4e-fb07-4fd6-80e4-a8f6ed0ad74a-1

An above ground baby pool that's

f492b68c-728d-4b88-a1b4-e88dd0f1a339-0
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.885
Anybody jumping in, it looks

f492b68c-728d-4b88-a1b4-e88dd0f1a339-1
00:31:14.885 --> 00:31:18.940
there and they're having a good
time. Actually, no. There's some

f492b68c-728d-4b88-a1b4-e88dd0f1a339-2
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.932
adults in there too, but they're
splashing each other, throwing

f492b68c-728d-4b88-a1b4-e88dd0f1a339-3
00:31:22.932 --> 00:31:24.180
water on each other.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.787
They have some guns, water guns,
that they're squirting people

0c399ac7-ae65-4f54-ba19-14f8ebe9494b-1
00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:33.862
outside the boats or outside of
the pool with the water, and

0c399ac7-ae65-4f54-ba19-14f8ebe9494b-2
00:31:33.862 --> 00:31:38.070
everybody seems to be having a
good time laughing and smiling.

a5bd1c57-f9ba-49c1-aff7-3aea03fb43c0-0
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.450
They, there's a group doing a
tug of war.

fda2a190-0766-4904-a87c-b799db353389-0
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.892
Between there's the the gift
table and then there's the food

fda2a190-0766-4904-a87c-b799db353389-1
00:31:46.892 --> 00:31:50.482
table, and between those two
tables there's a group playing a

fda2a190-0766-4904-a87c-b799db353389-2
00:31:50.482 --> 00:31:51.120
tug of war.

a856e580-06c5-4740-9785-5b843b03aa68-0

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.793
Flag is right above the line, so
nobody's winning. It's pretty

eaf2804f-74dd-4200-88cb-8ae384850cb0-1
00:32:02.793 --> 00:32:03.930
even right now.

bbe21dc6-e06f-40d3-90e8-4344c3ae2537-0
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.950
On one side of the tug of war.

b9b03c6c-eea9-4436-8545-53026d967cce-0

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:17.546
Looks like the pirates and then
the other side are the Vikings

0f6b86f4-143c-4a9c-a911-5a4ac926896e-1
00:32:17.546 --> 00:32:22.360

At the food table, it's stacked
high with good food and people

954f4e32-5ff3-42db-b834-b7cbe85c9a14-1
00:32:31.064 --> 00:32:32.500

Enjoying that.

0273dca3-08dc-4a49-8dab-7d018d12b1bf-0
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.990
In the middle of the yard in a
tree.

30eee954-68b3-4a65-ab30-168c535d8868-0
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.760
With looks like some lanterns on
it and some flowers.

950973e8-a0e7-4ffd-a2f7-c668860117cf-0
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.760
Um, and people are gathered
around the tree, but not really

950973e8-a0e7-4ffd-a2f7-c668860117cf-1
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.320
looking at the tree or anything.
It's just there.

dce15802-980e-4c2d-ae78-0c2b4d02de9a-0
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.992
It's just there. But between the
little swimming pool and the

dce15802-980e-4c2d-ae78-0c2b4d02de9a-1
00:33:05.992 --> 00:33:10.700
food table, there is a clown and
he has a bunch of balloons in

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.810
his hand. They're helium
balloons. They're floating in

dce15802-980e-4c2d-ae78-0c2b4d02de9a-3
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:18.920
the air and people are watching
him do his tricks. And

dce15802-980e-4c2d-ae78-0c2b4d02de9a-4
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.179

group, is in a costume. They

dce15802-980e-4c2d-ae78-0c2b4d02de9a-5

A renaissance gown on and
there's a lion.

e6f8cfb0-79e3-4672-a4b3-233d4a862cab-0
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.250
Anyway, they're all enjoying the
clown show.

62637b46-b92e-4cf4-8501-0c6341024266-0
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.621
And as you go on to the next oh,
at the top of the page, heading

62637b46-b92e-4cf4-8501-0c6341024266-1

towards the table is a man with
the birthday cake.

95be29f0-5b33-4ab6-9eea-cc5857192f56-0
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.702
And he's singing Happy Birthday,
but and there's a few people

95be29f0-5b33-4ab6-9eea-cc5857192f56-1
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:59.905

00:33:59.905 --> 00:34:04.244
one's really paying attention to
that because everybody's doing

95be29f0-5b33-4ab6-9eea-cc5857192f56-3
00:34:04.244 --> 00:34:08.582
something besides the tug of war
and the clown and the swimming

95be29f0-5b33-4ab6-9eea-cc5857192f56-4
00:34:08.582 --> 00:34:11.430
pool and the food. There's also
a pinata.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.702
And the pinata is a colorful
donkey hanging from the tree,

572f63a0-01be-4d81-b524-77034728050b-1
00:34:16.702 --> 00:34:20.300
and there's a group of parents
helping the kids.

610e7026-95a8-497b-b994-ab7f8d5a1bb9-0
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:27.615
Put their blindfold on and and
strike the pinata so they're all

610e7026-95a8-497b-b994-ab7f8d5a1bb9-1
00:34:27.615 --> 00:34:32.871
enjoying the pinata. This looks
like such a fun party. And then

610e7026-95a8-497b-b994-ab7f8d5a1bb9-2
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:38.044

They're running around chasing

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.960
I'm looking at a scene. It's 2
pages of a book.

b8bb08e8-342f-4689-b156-0d9cbe26ea44-0

That's very dark.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.840
It's actually kind of hard to
see.

512a7b25-1b93-4dc6-b396-c1f81f71ff74-0
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.730
On the left page.

bf8bbbe0-3fae-4192-9a9f-d9ead200b52c-0
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:28.570
Obviously it's at night because
the main part of this.

149f6367-95d6-459a-ada6-91ec226d9224-0
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.850

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.277
That is lit, and you can tell
that the lights are on because

845f831e-a235-4642-b168-b73171d606d2-1
00:37:39.277 --> 00:37:43.421

man in the middle of the bridge

bridge there is looks to be like

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:20.672
That has stripes on the sides
that looks like a big top tent

f22e3955-6655-434d-8a96-2af4c1cbcf14-1
00:38:20.672 --> 00:38:22.690
where a circus might be held.

0523efd8-edbb-4afd-9d7d-7c7f2bd94a77-0
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.860
And behind that tent.

a82af596-39bf-48b3-bbd5-adcdde379779-0
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.080

A metal Ferris wheel. It's very
dark so it's hard to tell. And

a1f3df9b-e18e-47c9-9118-46bd57424607-1
00:38:35.004 --> 00:38:36.310
then there's a.

18d3498a-a051-4940-866f-7350b7a320fb-0
00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:42.933
A building to the right of the
Ferris wheel that's just a tower

18d3498a-a051-4940-866f-7350b7a320fb-1
00:38:42.933 --> 00:38:48.370

or door and a little balcony.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.770
Towards the bottom of this
picture, underneath the bridge.

6a4a62f2-7374-4716-a79b-44d4b7b73e35-0

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.960
A car has gone off the road and
it has.

25a2c1f5-e623-477e-9115-b9ff51b88559-0
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:10.454
Gone into a ditch. It doesn't
look like there's liquid down

25a2c1f5-e623-477e-9115-b9ff51b88559-1
00:39:10.454 --> 00:39:11.360
there although.

f2441e80-6221-4602-9a61-1a0785ef7208-0
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.600
It looks like yeah the river is
dry, but the car has.

63b08b64-95f2-43ff-b10b-ab3565c1d9d4-0
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:20.129
Gone off the road and down into
the river and as I look at the

63b08b64-95f2-43ff-b10b-ab3565c1d9d4-1
00:39:20.129 --> 00:39:20.710

Umm.

8bdfa8e8-03c4-4755-8851-22eb397da10e-0
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.613
To the right of the gas station,
in front of the gas station

8bdfa8e8-03c4-4755-8851-22eb397da10e-1
00:39:27.613 --> 00:39:32.119
there's a road, and to the right
of the gas station there's a

8bdfa8e8-03c4-4755-8851-22eb397da10e-2
00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:32.410
bar.

fbb5c040-9fab-4448-bee9-41f3ac3e3f73-0
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:37.957
And there's a truck that's
sitting parked on the road

fbb5c040-9fab-4448-bee9-41f3ac3e3f73-1
00:39:37.957 --> 00:39:41.340
outside of the bar and the bait
shop.

3a6cba3f-8fac-4f7c-9e41-3b0de2d87895-0
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.983
Between the bar and the bait
shop there is a stairway, a

3a6cba3f-8fac-4f7c-9e41-3b0de2d87895-1
00:39:47.983 --> 00:39:51.697
concrete stairway heading up to
what looks to be like an

3a6cba3f-8fac-4f7c-9e41-3b0de2d87895-2
00:39:51.697 --> 00:39:54.759
apartment building with some
windows that are.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.180
Lighted up.

494ba311-3494-4cab-b3c4-8537df2a4dfa-0

Umm.

1a4c826c-b93e-45bf-bf94-bbd0df6b290c-0
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.110
So the bait shop.

34786b54-98be-4eb7-94c3-a29feaac0894-0
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:05.562
It's after the bar and then next
to the bait shop. It looks like

34786b54-98be-4eb7-94c3-a29feaac0894-1
00:40:05.562 --> 00:40:06.060
a garage.

4e60129c-6b59-4d34-b02b-2239efa5b303-0
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.290
That may have.

1e6246f2-1ef5-4d58-9ed5-fb6036b6c588-0
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:13.005
Had an old warehouse or
something, and there's a person

1e6246f2-1ef5-4d58-9ed5-fb6036b6c588-1
00:40:13.005 --> 00:40:17.411
crossing the street between the
bait shop and the bar or in the

1e6246f2-1ef5-4d58-9ed5-fb6036b6c588-2
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:18.099
warehouse.

71522abf-a813-44e6-8c54-770c1b117b0a-0
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.370
Umm.

5fab80fc-8e93-4afe-9eca-04befa52dd3a-0
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:27.448
Along the road in front of the
bait shop opposite the bait shop

5fab80fc-8e93-4afe-9eca-04befa52dd3a-1
00:40:27.448 --> 00:40:28.480
is a wooden.

38e1218c-2914-4b7c-9eaa-4f9470952157-0
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.650
Dock.

c964a096-649f-4237-b30b-afbebf061684-0
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.372
But because there's no water in
the river, you can see the poles

c964a096-649f-4237-b30b-afbebf061684-1
00:40:36.372 --> 00:40:39.320
that the that are holding the
dock up.

fa9a32a4-4556-4f36-ae84-37c8782574b0-0
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:45.752
And if you were standing on the
dock and looking into the river,

fa9a32a4-4556-4f36-ae84-37c8782574b0-1
00:40:45.752 --> 00:40:50.923
all you would see is mud and
sand and a little bit of water

fa9a32a4-4556-4f36-ae84-37c8782574b0-2
00:40:50.923 --> 00:40:56.180
at the bottom, and then there's
a an old anchor stuck in the

fa9a32a4-4556-4f36-ae84-37c8782574b0-3
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.559
sand in the mud.

7a823ca0-a9d3-4e25-94d7-0403f4fbf8d9-0
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.590
And that's that scene.

9aa00016-bea8-424c-a74f-bf5f40218210-0
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:07.880
So.

b01d514b-4d57-48e3-9e70-4dca1365bcdf-0
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.140
The man who was originally on
the.

304d352f-cecb-44f1-8d59-f781951c9918-0
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.560
bridge

2fd29da8-3d55-4b8b-b9f3-9ddda65b242b-0
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.049
As he crossed the river towards
the bar and walked past the bait

2fd29da8-3d55-4b8b-b9f3-9ddda65b242b-1
00:41:21.049 --> 00:41:26.324
shop and the warehouse and has
come to a main square, another

2fd29da8-3d55-4b8b-b9f3-9ddda65b242b-2
00:41:26.324 --> 00:41:26.920
Piazza.

e224abc2-ab8a-48cd-8eab-fdbcc49408f7-0
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.800
And.

b71c96b1-70f8-4dba-a942-928681c0cd04-0
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.941
It's well lit and there are some
people walking around. Not many.

b71c96b1-70f8-4dba-a942-928681c0cd04-1
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:39.833
Most of the people are up in
their, up in their rooms or in

b71c96b1-70f8-4dba-a942-928681c0cd04-2
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:41.220
their apartments.

d763d993-4108-467e-958e-b9e66b792cd1-0
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.570
Umm.

519194ba-ce79-4ebf-9cda-79afa02cf4cf-0
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.178
On the left page of this scene,
the man is standing under, a

519194ba-ce79-4ebf-9cda-79afa02cf4cf-1
00:41:49.178 --> 00:41:54.522
bright street light is lit up
and you can see that he now has

519194ba-ce79-4ebf-9cda-79afa02cf4cf-2
00:41:54.522 --> 00:41:56.850
a blue hat and a red scarf.

392c78f1-8f0c-468c-9764-e2ba8be55a28-0
00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.270
And it looks like a.

a5b3db57-0c28-48e7-a26f-2a851b10ef5a-0
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.920
Gray or brown coat?

7e7150fb-1c5a-4c33-a955-d53cb1b07af4-0
00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:07.807
And what looks like maybe a cat
instead of a dog, I can't really

7e7150fb-1c5a-4c33-a955-d53cb1b07af4-1
00:42:07.807 --> 00:42:08.530
tell yet.

1119f07d-16d0-418c-bf8b-387332f2e3dd-0
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.740
But he's lit up and the store.

86cd12b2-42c7-4c84-819b-3edbd5582956-0
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:14.930
And.

95a87ff1-8214-4980-8bf3-e4ac4ae45e90-0
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.869
To his left, as I'm looking at
it, there is an apartment

95a87ff1-8214-4980-8bf3-e4ac4ae45e90-1
00:42:21.869 --> 00:42:26.220
building or a house that is made
of stone, and it has.

88bf1ba8-e23f-4363-850a-279238015816-0
00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.090
On the 2nd floor 2 Windows that
have.

8adacefb-89da-47f1-bfa6-297c1ace6d39-0
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.910
I forget things that you close
that you can close the window.

7aa2636c-7faa-427d-bb93-402b250c5af7-0
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:38.230
And.

380b5f03-25bd-4576-9d02-54289531cb3b-0
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:43.128
An arched doorway with four
steps that you can walk up into

380b5f03-25bd-4576-9d02-54289531cb3b-1
00:42:43.128 --> 00:42:43.820
the house.

d656278f-ecba-491a-892c-7afa4ba8c089-0
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:48.290
And outside the stairwell is a
garbage can.

f0608e66-ea7b-41ae-adf1-1aebf965633f-0
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.805
In front of the man where he's
walking straight ahead, there's

f0608e66-ea7b-41ae-adf1-1aebf965633f-1
00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:58.550
a fountain that looks like with
a statue of a man on a horse.

bd047a04-6cd6-4b84-adc2-e45547c50799-0
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.961
And to the to the right of the
man. As I'm looking at the

bd047a04-6cd6-4b84-adc2-e45547c50799-1
00:43:03.961 --> 00:43:07.621
picture, there's another
building. It looks like a

bd047a04-6cd6-4b84-adc2-e45547c50799-2
00:43:07.621 --> 00:43:11.926
storefront with windows on the
1st floor and an awning. And

bd047a04-6cd6-4b84-adc2-e45547c50799-3
00:43:11.926 --> 00:43:16.088
then when there's a couple
windows on the 2nd floor where

bd047a04-6cd6-4b84-adc2-e45547c50799-4
00:43:16.088 --> 00:43:16.950
people live.

9abe2d36-1a6d-4041-a78d-d08f8c8c2579-0
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:19.460
Um.

0cd3a8a2-7781-42dd-ad6d-a9cae1a1ec8d-0
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:26.236
There's a corner and as in well
in front of the man as he's

0cd3a8a2-7781-42dd-ad6d-a9cae1a1ec8d-1
00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:31.073
walking straight ahead past the
fountain there's a cafe, which

0cd3a8a2-7781-42dd-ad6d-a9cae1a1ec8d-2
00:43:31.073 --> 00:43:35.910
is maybe where he's heading to
go have a drink or some dinner.

9e9829b7-e891-4acd-9810-c6b0dab43d47-0
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.920
And the cafe is 3 stories. It
looks like it has the business

9e9829b7-e891-4acd-9810-c6b0dab43d47-1
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.894
on the bottom and then there are
apartment buildings on the

9e9829b7-e891-4acd-9810-c6b0dab43d47-2
00:43:45.894 --> 00:43:50.200
second and third floor where you
can see there are people inside

9e9829b7-e891-4acd-9810-c6b0dab43d47-3
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:50.730
sitting.

7aff29af-0c98-40ce-b3cc-5c78db47d15e-0
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:52.790
or talking.

93d335e2-efa6-49d1-aa16-3720a41e563b-0
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:57.609
And there's this, there's a
lamppost down in front of the

93d335e2-efa6-49d1-aa16-3720a41e563b-1
00:43:57.609 --> 00:43:59.350
cafe that's brightly lit.

6b5bb72d-4e09-4fee-bf25-65ed7df93940-0
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.290
And underneath that lamppost,
there's a man sitting in a car.

cc744bdd-b289-4fd8-9c1d-7e60b6b1c5ea-0
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.586
With the lights on, I don't know
if he stopped there or if he's

cc744bdd-b289-4fd8-9c1d-7e60b6b1c5ea-1
00:44:08.586 --> 00:44:12.709
just waiting until the man, the
man who's walking gets out of

cc744bdd-b289-4fd8-9c1d-7e60b6b1c5ea-2
00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:15.370
the street so that he can move
forward.

6ef5b139-862f-4bf6-965e-5a6e7b88c57c-0
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:21.942
And in the lower right hand
corner of the second page,

6ef5b139-862f-4bf6-965e-5a6e7b88c57c-1
00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:23.140
there's a man.

a575bbcd-e381-4d6b-bb4a-804ce1208589-0
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.860
Standing at his balcony.

6781f3de-cae8-4b71-842f-92645858bd9d-0
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.688
He's just walked out onto his
balcony and looking down into

6781f3de-cae8-4b71-842f-92645858bd9d-1
00:44:32.688 --> 00:44:36.530
something that's well lit
because his face is bright.

32d566dd-91dd-4108-b246-97f184af9439-0
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.660
Next page.

655dca63-ad21-4329-8860-f12fe1b45134-0
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.760
So.

4fa5ff10-f97f-40fc-85a9-c12254aeeb35-0
00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:53.430
The man who was walking over the
bridge and down the road in the

4fa5ff10-f97f-40fc-85a9-c12254aeeb35-1
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.260
blue hat and red scarf.

45d354de-1595-477c-abdf-0b5e14c80cb1-0
00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.160
Has crossed the street and
walked past the fountain.

2be72d25-9108-4172-9b1d-c985af197e71-0
00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.720
Umm.

fc9ae36d-1aef-4eb2-8e89-d364735a52f4-0
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.690
And.

81a2e443-d1d0-4e0f-8fa2-5eb624ac8412-0
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.210
Has passed the cafe.

af21288f-b542-4690-8149-788d2b1bd999-0
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:12.210
Where there was a man sitting
out in front.

97f767e5-e2a0-4c5c-8b91-1ef967171766-0
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.540
And is heading towards.

63c612bc-d5c4-4fd0-b3e5-d3453a3b0749-0
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.570
A small house.

35ead27a-fa93-4a6a-81a8-38f77c23a65c-0
00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.080
A little.

b836d7a3-7acb-438e-a38a-fbecc74e2a44-0
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.090
Two-story house. Very cute.

fe3f9d91-a8ea-4163-ac17-581928ccc4f5-0
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.150
With the big door in the front
and two windows.

b5b433c7-e4e2-4eca-b507-3e9f40dde780-0
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.803
And a walkway and and in in
front of the house it says that

b5b433c7-e4e2-4eca-b507-3e9f40dde780-1
00:45:32.803 --> 00:45:33.740
it's for sale.

4bec0ef9-e235-4949-904e-9e211784d789-0
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.670
So it looks as if he's wondering
if he should buy this house.

17876e34-6db8-4f74-ad70-5ac987f08fb4-0
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:42.720
Um, behind this little house
there's a big tree.

bac90ef3-cb09-4a49-96c2-a95f9119f384-0
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.485
It looks like the house is not
in that great of a condition.

bac90ef3-cb09-4a49-96c2-a95f9119f384-1
00:45:49.485 --> 00:45:51.010
There's a ladder in front.

d379d7c0-82ce-440f-8f80-3934d506ddcb-0
00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.651
The windows look like they're
broken or the the the curtains

d379d7c0-82ce-440f-8f80-3934d506ddcb-1
00:45:56.651 --> 00:46:01.010
and the windows are tattered and
torn. The roof is sagging.

6ef0984e-723f-4353-bc53-af06283c38c5-0
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.310
So that hasn't been habited in a
long time, but.

b8a2d41d-ffed-46a5-ac26-1a8f587e31fa-0
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.632
It looks like it would be a good
deal. You can get it for a good

b8a2d41d-ffed-46a5-ac26-1a8f587e31fa-1
00:46:10.632 --> 00:46:10.930
price.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.533
Behind that, there are other
houses where people are

07d7c764-3b3d-4b2a-b7bf-1e661a37370c-1
00:46:15.533 --> 00:46:16.510
currently living.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.283
To the right of the little house
that's for sale is a brick house

d7538b4b-5b71-419a-b752-dfbd1807cb5a-1
00:46:23.283 --> 00:46:28.055
that's two stories high. And
there are people living in that

d7538b4b-5b71-419a-b752-dfbd1807cb5a-2
00:46:28.055 --> 00:46:31.810
house and they each window has

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.843
And next to the Brick House is a
a stone house with stucco and

b215b576-3625-45e1-828e-29921e16bf2c-1
00:46:38.843 --> 00:46:43.885

At the window on the 2nd floor

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.741
And a fountain across the little
road. where there's a man

18ac2b49-22be-4cb2-b1c6-e7c485089aa4-1
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:13.150
sitting there with his daughter.

d7343d7b-8c77-4487-9c20-321660b397f6-0
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:14.810
Umm.

fcf50b6e-90e5-4f3b-b871-119096a45e2a-0
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.589
And there are a couple of other
three story houses that have

fcf50b6e-90e5-4f3b-b871-119096a45e2a-1
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:21.920
people in the windows.

460a5f97-eb11-4fc3-870e-2936c3c2ad32-0
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.257
So everybody seems to be home
for the night and enjoying their

460a5f97-eb11-4fc3-870e-2936c3c2ad32-1
00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:31.094
evening and doing what they do
and some people are out walking

460a5f97-eb11-4fc3-870e-2936c3c2ad32-2
00:47:31.094 --> 00:47:31.459

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:36.007
But the main scene is this man
trying to decide if he should

3bd9e14f-c1d1-482e-80ed-930a274e5894-1
00:47:36.007 --> 00:47:36.750

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:55.874
And the day has come and the for
sale sign has come down. The man

ab0606c5-3d22-4a10-8537-c75637297923-1
00:47:55.874 --> 00:48:00.570
has decided to buy the house and
he is fixing the house up.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:08.631
In this picture, the only
colorful image is the man and

b77b29aa-bb3b-449f-8bd9-ed1dc8018013-1
00:48:08.631 --> 00:48:11.970
his house and the tree that's.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:18.147
On his property, it's a
beautiful tree and it shades the

8b4a9d20-cf6a-474b-896c-1a50414655d0-1
00:48:18.147 --> 00:48:22.543
house and everything else. It's
the same scene except it's

8b4a9d20-cf6a-474b-896c-1a50414655d0-2
00:48:22.543 --> 00:48:26.939
daytime. The people have come
out of their houses, they're

00:48:26.939 --> 00:48:30.740
walking in the roads, they're
riding their Vespas.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.510
But the main thing that catches
your eye is the colorful scene

ea410192-f117-49db-a8a9-14c2ee92f417-1
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.730

And he's on a ladder.

ca32296f-1fde-496d-9820-f8bed9a30be8-0
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.560

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.990
Things that close, open, and
close.

e287d3c3-bf68-45fc-b921-daec7c2ea494-0
00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.590

has his lawn mower out and he's
mowed the lawn and so he's

63d9a3ae-e84b-423f-88cc-2de49f7deaa7-2
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:15.650

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.850
And you can see now that the
roof is.

f75df544-b7f6-467e-b046-41bdb81cd4ec-0
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:24.110

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.940
And the chimney is stone.

81e5c8d2-f599-4958-9953-972ca61cc817-0
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.750
And his house is made of stone.
It's very cute.

792cbfd0-e443-4b94-b531-8442f4c21de5-0
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:33.050

stopped by to talk to him.

17ea86a2-bd49-4eca-9cdf-f10b393749dc-1
00:49:39.027 --> 00:49:42.689
Everybody's just doing their
thing. And again, there are

17ea86a2-bd49-4eca-9cdf-f10b393749dc-2
00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:46.415
people in every every house.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.772
That's the other colorful thing
is the sky. The sky is blue with

726965bc-5410-4542-b2b8-1e6bd08466d2-1
00:50:03.772 --> 00:50:05.600
some pretty white clouds.

afa899f5-65eb-4a06-87b4-290fdc010709-0

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.940
As the day goes on.

9177a6e7-cdd4-4a4e-8571-2c63e8c13a06-0
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:29.415
The the sky gets less blue, the
scene is brighter, but the only

9177a6e7-cdd4-4a4e-8571-2c63e8c13a06-1
00:50:29.415 --> 00:50:30.980
thing that's bright.

The house is brighter, the the
windows are open, the he

45e773bd-e77a-4925-992a-d3a33f96d709-0
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:51.877
He has a chair sitting in the
window. The roof is now painted

45e773bd-e77a-4925-992a-d3a33f96d709-1
00:50:51.877 --> 00:50:55.690
a beautiful purple. The tree is
blooming red.

0b4c869d-ecb2-4669-829f-85fe26eacd91-0
00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.210
And.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.340
The man is off of his ladder and
it looks like he's heading out.

04f5481b-29f6-4946-a7e1-c0d384e7e4fe-0
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:11.676

0bd493e7-b042-4bdb-8f2f-928ab1afedbb-0
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.260
But it's very colorful, his
little corner of the world. The

0bd493e7-b042-4bdb-8f2f-928ab1afedbb-1
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.341
rest of the picture on both
sides is still black and white,

0bd493e7-b042-4bdb-8f2f-928ab1afedbb-2
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:29.149
although it's clearer and
brighter. Black and white and

0bd493e7-b042-4bdb-8f2f-928ab1afedbb-3

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.795
But there is one little other
colorful piece of the picture,

4a1eff21-7c33-414f-9c10-1d97020413bf-1
00:51:34.795 --> 00:51:36.370

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:51.393
Towards the fountain in the
picture, there's a little boy

059e54d7-8ac8-42ce-956b-09d30742b8dd-1
00:51:51.393 --> 00:51:55.120

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.915
And she's on the sidewalk,
walking towards the the Big

79cf97a2-ac93-4267-bbe8-b999dd7a0025-1
00:51:59.915 --> 00:52:01.940
Stone house with the stucco.

walkway in his yard, which also

0baa2ad2-c887-43f2-9b7f-149b28023c2e-2

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.230
Elsewhere in the scene there
are.

5e9be59b-b17a-4bf8-a7cc-549b8a56a9a5-0
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.498
Many more people on the streets
aren't quite as full as they

5e9be59b-b17a-4bf8-a7cc-549b8a56a9a5-1
00:52:34.498 --> 00:52:38.000

In the stone house with the
stucco, there's an artist

7d196708-d047-4912-97f5-cf7a89803a2c-1
00:52:46.146 --> 00:52:48.470

Artist palette in his hands.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.630

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.120
So the picture has gotten more
color.

590ec15b-2ace-4cbc-97ce-a5e11cb68be1-0
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.800

man and the little girl.

dbc03284-9b29-419c-a2c8-28b17ffb9e2d-0
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:39.010

4586ee11-4a17-4ba9-b57d-52d10914ae3d-1
00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:18.410
have gotten color, and maybe it
means that these are places

4586ee11-4a17-4ba9-b57d-52d10914ae3d-2
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.080
where the man has been, or or
people that the man has spoken

4586ee11-4a17-4ba9-b57d-52d10914ae3d-3
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.390
to and he's brought life and
meaning into their lives.

b7d048fd-e55d-45e6-92a9-99e0331b320d-0
00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.430
And there's one.

48cc2bf3-e747-4eb9-8130-55cfa15467c9-0
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:32.950
On the second page on the right
hand side.

07734484-981b-49c6-8407-d92489c6fa0b-0
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.104
There's a moving truck, a moving
van, and people are moving. It

07734484-981b-49c6-8407-d92489c6fa0b-1
00:55:38.104 --> 00:55:42.302
looks like they're moving things
into the van, so a family's

07734484-981b-49c6-8407-d92489c6fa0b-2
00:55:42.302 --> 00:55:43.060
moving out.

4e725a99-29ab-41bc-8c37-c3229be0648d-0
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.590
Umm.

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:50.950
Not much to say about that,
except that they're moving.

bd1502f2-9cb2-4fbc-b746-ed7215188297-0
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.436
And that there are. It's just
that the picture is taking on

bd1502f2-9cb2-4fbc-b746-ed7215188297-1
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:58.853
more color and it will be
interesting to see the next

bd1502f2-9cb2-4fbc-b746-ed7215188297-2
00:55:58.853 --> 00:55:59.170
page.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.856
So much more color in these
pages. As a matter of fact, I

e76ffc1d-1905-4b97-964d-14e6f57164a3-1
00:56:07.856 --> 00:56:13.381
think it's probably as bright as
it could be. And life is good.

e76ffc1d-1905-4b97-964d-14e6f57164a3-2
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:18.129
This old man seems to have
brought life to this little

e76ffc1d-1905-4b97-964d-14e6f57164a3-3
00:56:18.129 --> 00:56:18.820
village.

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:25.548
Filled up the house with joy.
People are coming and going and

bcd3e0be-e696-431f-abd8-79097079c686-1
00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:26.150
at this.

c3c5e044-63cd-46b2-ac7b-8579c66af998-0
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.608
At this time he's having a
cookout and he's inviting people

c3c5e044-63cd-46b2-ac7b-8579c66af998-1
00:56:31.608 --> 00:56:36.433
to come by and and enjoy each
other's company and be together

c3c5e044-63cd-46b2-ac7b-8579c66af998-2
00:56:36.433 --> 00:56:40.790
and possibly may have even
gotten married and there's a

c3c5e044-63cd-46b2-ac7b-8579c66af998-3
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.670
woman in along the walkway with
him.

0e62ed52-1b17-4bdb-9bb7-42bf4efa555a-0
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.560
Um, and maybe.

bbf4433a-dbc6-4cc4-8bb1-f1a520f59caa-0
00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.270
She had some grandchildren and
they've come to visit.

ec177c3e-faa0-4cd0-b1bf-730217a2e862-0
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:58.230
And the kids are playing in the
street and the dog, and there's

ec177c3e-faa0-4cd0-b1bf-730217a2e862-1
00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:02.164
a man in a wheelchair who broke
his leg and he's walking past

ec177c3e-faa0-4cd0-b1bf-730217a2e862-2
00:57:02.164 --> 00:57:05.210
and the little girl is saying
hello to him and.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.600
People are talking and meeting
and.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.920
The brick is bright red and the
walls are.

ad5b21e3-630e-4e12-85ac-e9c192f6dece-0
00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:19.857
um white and the roofs are
purple. And the awnings, they're

ad5b21e3-630e-4e12-85ac-e9c192f6dece-1
00:57:19.857 --> 00:57:23.680
colorful and there's a bright
red car in the road.

1fe589e4-d3a7-49be-8eb1-0fe93c03f065-0
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.380
And just people coming and
going.

c3369629-8c2a-4800-803a-efd0be32aca1-0
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:28.840
In color and life.

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.790
Umm.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.160
So the day is passing.

a7e2953e-a025-4f34-bb6d-23bc11aaa717-0
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.400

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:46.790
It starts to and dusk is
dawning.

6ceb862d-417f-4e10-9832-3b487c7aa4dd-0
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.617
And the people are still out
they're enjoying the time

6ceb862d-417f-4e10-9832-3b487c7aa4dd-1
00:57:51.617 --> 00:57:52.290
together.

e5bbcdd2-2e6a-4b0c-951d-7b0f8767094a-0
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.180
The ice cream truck has come by.

b88b432e-1978-4df5-9af7-2fd9ba83398f-0
00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.728
Our ice cream cart in front of
the man's, the little little

b88b432e-1978-4df5-9af7-2fd9ba83398f-1
00:58:01.728 --> 00:58:06.656
man's, the man's small house,
humble abode. The milk truck is

b88b432e-1978-4df5-9af7-2fd9ba83398f-2
00:58:06.656 --> 00:58:07.609
still there.

aedb44a7-c6ea-4425-be56-4f69558725b3-0
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.107
The lamp, the street lamps are
coming on, but people are out

aedb44a7-c6ea-4425-be56-4f69558725b3-1
00:58:13.107 --> 00:58:17.567
enjoying themselves. The kids
are still out playing ball. The

aedb44a7-c6ea-4425-be56-4f69558725b3-2
00:58:17.567 --> 00:58:19.150
the artist is now out.

Umm.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.280
On the street.

a61345b3-1ea3-40cc-aecb-1468e8a23942-0
00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:25.870
Umm.

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:33.292
People are at the cafe, sitting
out and talking and eating and

55def0c8-f212-4a02-bb0c-64278823484d-1
00:58:33.292 --> 00:58:37.841
people are up in their rooms,
the lights are on and everybody

00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:40.630
seems to be so happy and the man
has.

4fe060bf-bf53-45dc-919d-b93698f6513f-0
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:45.090
Is playing with the children in
the street.

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:50.294
Has one child on his shoulders
and another one is pushing him

00:58:50.294 --> 00:58:51.420
and laughing and.

fc5be852-c1e3-4e39-adbd-0f3f89dc8fd1-0
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:56.120
Walking in a little parade down
the cobblestone Street.

33660b5b-0697-47b4-9178-1c3e583f88ab-0
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.460
Umm.

71669803-360a-45a2-a14d-1d102610f572-0
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.783
And a young and old elderly
couple is walking arm in arm,

71669803-360a-45a2-a14d-1d102610f572-1
00:59:02.783 --> 00:59:06.750
and the mom and her daughter are
over by the fountain.

c4da8819-5de8-44cd-8d8c-10b633974a62-0
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:09.880
And there's even a man up on the
roof.

2a85ed38-317f-4664-860e-f18e81c61ee0-0
00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:12.510
Waving to the crowds.

5fcb302e-5e33-4700-b206-df174fb0b0f8-0
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.775
But the town, the little
village, is lit up, and the

5fcb302e-5e33-4700-b206-df174fb0b0f8-1
00:59:17.775 --> 00:59:20.340
cobblestone streets are alive
with life.

4459e3e6-940b-4fe2-bd9a-ce199be02309-0
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.740
Ohh.

12a19283-ec3a-4c00-bc01-a4ad3febf755-0
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:43.747
It's night time again. The
village is full of life. The

12a19283-ec3a-4c00-bc01-a4ad3febf755-1
00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:44.690
colors are.

c8b34769-0a94-44ca-a1e5-638f10fccd16-0
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:51.819
Back and this is a picture on
the left side of the old man

c8b34769-0a94-44ca-a1e5-638f10fccd16-1
00:59:51.819 --> 00:59:55.990
walking out of town as he came
into town.

830bede4-b089-4010-aa4a-be5520eca017-0
00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.480
But this time, the town is
colorful and alive.

bfb003c4-86b3-4c71-a9c2-81ea40a3b84f-0
01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:04.400
And I don't know if he's leaving
for good, but it looks like.

720271c1-32c5-4926-a9b8-980f55cd9735-0
01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.180
There is a.

ced4daf4-9f39-409f-833b-f0ce06dbad9b-0

Family.

e9de6e52-03a0-43dc-a77b-6d2e1b1754d7-0
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:15.732
Maybe he sold his house to them
or he's renting it to them, but

e9de6e52-03a0-43dc-a77b-6d2e1b1754d7-1
01:00:15.732 --> 01:00:18.520
they are standing up on the
balcony.

5bc56509-4d4b-4ca2-9b06-eb2a4b62f80a-0
01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:25.745
Looking towards the back of
man's house, where maybe the

5bc56509-4d4b-4ca2-9b06-eb2a4b62f80a-1
01:00:25.745 --> 01:00:27.840
tree was or is standing.

0567dea2-f3ff-42c3-89dd-107bf76c4c3f-0
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.083
There's three people, man and
his wife and their little girl,

0567dea2-f3ff-42c3-89dd-107bf76c4c3f-1
01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:38.242
and they're looking over the
balcony, away from the the

0567dea2-f3ff-42c3-89dd-107bf76c4c3f-2
01:00:38.242 --> 01:00:42.697
streets, away from the fountain
and away from the cafe, and

0567dea2-f3ff-42c3-89dd-107bf76c4c3f-3
01:00:42.697 --> 01:00:46.410
they're looking to the back
where the tree stood.

9b07982a-b789-45b8-9542-d4316a2d0dc0-0
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.407
And the old man is in his blue
hat and green coat and red scarf

9b07982a-b789-45b8-9542-d4316a2d0dc0-1
01:00:52.407 --> 01:00:57.390
and his little dog or cat, and
they're walking away down the

9b07982a-b789-45b8-9542-d4316a2d0dc0-2
01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.720
cobblestone street out of town
the way they came in.

00e68506-2b5f-459f-b6f4-1ae32ea76068-0
01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.170
Turn the page.

7f05f612-2f62-4fe1-b7ad-b9a248b13559-0
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:10.300
And.

4151dd9c-0748-4e15-86fb-1aa547f9e708-0
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.654
As he walks to another part of
town, he finds another house

4151dd9c-0748-4e15-86fb-1aa547f9e708-1
01:01:16.654 --> 01:01:20.650
that's for sale in another area
where the.

e28b9fda-1270-47ad-9387-27772d1b2061-0
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:26.289
The houses are black and white
and Gray and there is no life

e28b9fda-1270-47ad-9387-27772d1b2061-1
01:01:26.289 --> 01:01:31.330
and it's just people are looking
out their windows at him, but he

e28b9fda-1270-47ad-9387-27772d1b2061-2
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.760
still has color, he still has
life, and it looks as if he

e28b9fda-1270-47ad-9387-27772d1b2061-3
01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.419
wants to bring his joy and his
life to another part of town.

3cb7f448-1efe-4322-8119-32b7bc6853e2-0
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.170
So he's standing in front of
this House, contemplating

3cb7f448-1efe-4322-8119-32b7bc6853e2-1
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.480
whether or not he should buy it.

71a9906d-2eac-4026-a893-cee2e3966b59-0
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:58.700

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:05.400
There's a little girl standing
on her doorstep.

2f5553e3-87a4-4b63-8fc1-c7a7134e996e-0
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.110
And she's.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:13.430
In color. She has a red jumper
with yellow shirt.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.300
And and headband in her hair.
And her eyes are big and blue

74b4785d-6b7e-48f9-be33-96cf0ce84493-1
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.271
and she's excited about a
beautiful little Violet flower

74b4785d-6b7e-48f9-be33-96cf0ce84493-2
01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:22.620
that.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.860
I'm guessing the man just gave
to her and she's so happy and.

Her father is sitting in the
window and.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:37.639
He also is holding a red flower
and he has a red bow tie and he

4c00cbbc-3319-4f60-8510-4b9d207c5163-1
01:02:37.639 --> 01:02:42.478
seems to be happy with his
flower also and happy that his

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:51.631
In the lower right part of this
picture, all you see is the man,

7d8a5522-2f3d-443b-a90f-61e0fb3657f7-1
01:02:51.631 --> 01:02:53.700

the little girl and her father.

7db1c57b-5204-4bd0-b157-7ae361033ae6-3
01:08:53.699 --> 01:08:58.761
entangled. But on each slide
there are lots of people sliding

7db1c57b-5204-4bd0-b157-7ae361033ae6-4
01:08:58.761 --> 01:08:59.170

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:05.650
And lots of people in line. The
slides come down a group of

26617576-3a28-4e4d-8520-de961fc6e9fa-1
01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:10.560
rocks so that people are are
climbing up the rocks and then

26617576-3a28-4e4d-8520-de961fc6e9fa-2
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.979
getting on the slide and sliding
down into the water.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:21.736
Where it's full of people, it's
a very crowded day at the water

1c14c839-2ca9-4a48-a382-fd5417bbfea2-1
01:09:21.736 --> 01:09:22.130

So the water is full of crowds
of people in inner tubes and

dd2ade3e-ccff-4a1e-b1ff-e0d2b447b30f-1
01:09:29.458 --> 01:09:34.500
just swimming and and then

01:09:44.163 --> 01:09:49.077
the pirate ship is a big slide,
a big yellow slide and kids are

08d0c621-74a9-47ef-9419-0032c00de146-2

The rope lines.

8f8d126f-7577-4b30-9a22-354165e244b4-0
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:13.532
Up to the top of the masts on
the pirate ship, they're

8f8d126f-7577-4b30-9a22-354165e244b4-1

ship, maybe even some of them

8f8d126f-7577-4b30-9a22-354165e244b4-2
01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:23.954

the pirate ship there's a sea

8f8d126f-7577-4b30-9a22-354165e244b4-3

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:26.759
Oh, not balls. They're
sprinklers that look like

d15a2d97-84b4-4511-b8b1-76cdd0c8dec9-1
01:11:26.759 --> 01:11:30.247

Lots to do at this park.

f8fd45e2-c297-41e3-a086-a4c0084fc1ed-0
01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:03.801
And there are. There's one area
away from the swimming area that

f8fd45e2-c297-41e3-a086-a4c0084fc1ed-1
01:12:03.801 --> 01:12:08.950
has a lazy ride, I forget, it's
on inner tubes, whatever those

f8fd45e2-c297-41e3-a086-a4c0084fc1ed-2
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:14.016
are called. The inner tube rides
where the people are just in

f8fd45e2-c297-41e3-a086-a4c0084fc1ed-3
01:12:14.016 --> 01:12:16.060

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.730
Floating down the river.

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:21.630
And.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.629
Sometimes there's a bridge
crossing over the the lazy

e0a9095a-beaf-47a1-b0d4-0f94245263b4-1
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:31.185
lagoon and people are standing
on the bridge squirting the

e0a9095a-beaf-47a1-b0d4-0f94245263b4-2
01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:35.972
people in the inner tubes and
looks like they're having a lot

e0a9095a-beaf-47a1-b0d4-0f94245263b4-3
01:12:35.972 --> 01:12:40.837
of fun and lots of people just
relaxing in their inner tube as

e0a9095a-beaf-47a1-b0d4-0f94245263b4-4
01:12:40.837 --> 01:12:42.150
they float along.

20a99c21-75f7-4119-9137-1329402ee8bd-0
01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:47.372
And on the one side of the
bridge, there's a seating area,

20a99c21-75f7-4119-9137-1329402ee8bd-1
01:12:47.372 --> 01:12:51.767
so if you don't want to be in
the water, sit and get a tan on

20a99c21-75f7-4119-9137-1329402ee8bd-2
01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:52.759
your blankets.

4f774403-e523-4649-9e0f-fbf2d7c053e3-0

01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:40.117
This story has 44 slides to it,
so some of the pages will have

3 rows of two pictures each. In
the first picture top left

A person, I don't know if it's a
person in a costume or a

2f8f7db0-8908-448f-bd63-c1f3ce8da860-1
01:14:13.604 --> 01:14:16.310
creature that has, is black.

And it has a horn coming out of
it.

559ea2aa-c5a5-48f8-8501-0b9e5a755e1c-0
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.725
Or head and a horn coming out
the back of its head and he's

559ea2aa-c5a5-48f8-8501-0b9e5a755e1c-1
01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:28.420
helping a young man.

4ff7710a-42fd-4271-8d5f-697999e3b8bb-0
01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:37.112
Fold a large piece of paper or
fabric, a white piece of paper

4ff7710a-42fd-4271-8d5f-697999e3b8bb-1
01:14:37.112 --> 01:14:44.065
or fabric, and they and so they
fold it one time over on the top

4ff7710a-42fd-4271-8d5f-697999e3b8bb-2
01:14:44.065 --> 01:14:50.269
left. After the second picture,
on the top right is there

4ff7710a-42fd-4271-8d5f-697999e3b8bb-3
01:14:50.269 --> 01:14:57.115
folding each of the corners in
and again it's this black figure

4ff7710a-42fd-4271-8d5f-697999e3b8bb-4
01:14:57.115 --> 01:14:59.790
in a cape with the horns.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.289
And a young man in the striped
shirt with blonde hair, a hat, a

7e7ceb14-e127-4182-9472-e4375a817bf2-1
01:15:04.289 --> 01:15:04.960

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:13.056
In the middle 2 pictures they
are folding the bottom half up

3891b6cf-6dd2-405f-9b6a-103ad1d8ec11-1
01:15:13.056 --> 01:15:18.900
towards the corners that were
folded and in the the.

9e7b8727-bb67-4d85-a999-cbeeef50fd08-0
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.300
Next picture, they folded the
other side and it looks like

9e7b8727-bb67-4d85-a999-cbeeef50fd08-1
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:28.760
they're folding a hat that we
used to make we were kids to

1bb87e83-47b8-48f2-a895-fda49e54a1bf-0
01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:30.140
Umm.

7f1d6f5a-cd78-46ee-9a32-731251479ea6-0
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:31.850
Put on.

95bbcf8a-b35f-4ae8-ad71-2a772a5c1614-0
01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.660
So they've come in the bottom
right, left picture, they're

95bbcf8a-b35f-4ae8-ad71-2a772a5c1614-1
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:42.395
still folding up the hat, and
then the bottom right picture,

95bbcf8a-b35f-4ae8-ad71-2a772a5c1614-2
01:15:42.395 --> 01:15:47.053
it's done. They finish their
sailor hat that is made out of

95bbcf8a-b35f-4ae8-ad71-2a772a5c1614-3
01:15:47.053 --> 01:15:51.710
paper or fabric, and they're
both holding it up in the air.

95bbcf8a-b35f-4ae8-ad71-2a772a5c1614-4
01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:55.670
And then the next page that you
look at is a boat.

b4c96332-c490-488d-8bd5-e32505e7afa9-0
01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.685
On top it's a pirate ship, a
very strange looking pirate ship

b4c96332-c490-488d-8bd5-e32505e7afa9-1
01:16:01.685 --> 01:16:02.050
with.

668f9069-3f47-4385-9ec7-7b389f3cea0c-0
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.950
Sails that.

6be72231-7dcd-41e4-b178-ff3810bd8f8d-0
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.340
Are balloon like.

d890990c-2dcb-4d51-80c2-759f5c8c132f-0
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.430
And it has a little.

e44a2bc9-5b0c-4fa9-95fa-ced4dd3f43d8-0
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.620
City on top.

dfd2fbe7-1525-4524-b7d1-d83b866eedbe-0
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:19.763
And underneath, instead of
having a propeller, it has what

dfd2fbe7-1525-4524-b7d1-d83b866eedbe-1
01:16:19.763 --> 01:16:24.215
looks like a submarine
containment that's a round

dfd2fbe7-1525-4524-b7d1-d83b866eedbe-2
01:16:24.215 --> 01:16:24.750
shape.

15a40fe2-a88c-4f6c-9ed5-23814993036f-0
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:25.810
that

0bfa9f3a-5df8-479a-8e55-dda800f82ff1-0
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:31.263
Someone could live in underneath
the water and there's a fan.

0bfa9f3a-5df8-479a-8e55-dda800f82ff1-1
01:16:31.263 --> 01:16:35.018
Looks like a a kind of
propeller, a fan propeller that

0bfa9f3a-5df8-479a-8e55-dda800f82ff1-2
01:16:35.018 --> 01:16:35.770
would move.

a7d5c78b-2834-4b1e-8cdc-d7004583d98a-0
01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:37.220
The boat.

7e81bc20-9d86-4c67-8e2b-5fe74cec8b5d-0
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:43.100
Mechanically and I can see now
this little hat.

b57024b9-2114-4fff-b721-c2bbc0c91628-0
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:47.944
That the man and the the black
being made is floating on the

b57024b9-2114-4fff-b721-c2bbc0c91628-1
01:16:47.944 --> 01:16:52.050
water towards the boat, or the
boat is floating towards it.

5f8e61c0-3557-435a-92bd-114ada6e9339-0
01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.280
And the boat

ee0e4bb3-3883-40c4-8392-b37fa1a5e9eb-0
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.130
The little hat.

79cddb4f-d2a1-4573-b818-f6a907d0c094-0
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.500
Boat

6a8cfaf2-8519-469b-bce7-c37aec0d9398-0
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:09.134
It's floating on the water. At
least it looks like water. It

6a8cfaf2-8519-469b-bce7-c37aec0d9398-1
01:17:09.134 --> 01:17:13.306
could be sand dunes, I can't
really tell, but there are

6a8cfaf2-8519-469b-bce7-c37aec0d9398-2
01:17:13.306 --> 01:17:18.222
seagulls that are floating above
it, they're flying above it. And

6a8cfaf2-8519-469b-bce7-c37aec0d9398-3
01:17:18.222 --> 01:17:22.841
so this little hat in the whole
2 pages is the whole scene is

6a8cfaf2-8519-469b-bce7-c37aec0d9398-4
01:17:22.841 --> 01:17:26.789
the birds flying through the air
and the little hat,

24f9c6af-7e39-4a09-85a4-bc36633ceffc-0
01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:30.950
A paper hat floating on the
water below them.

ab9d0ec0-da91-4a7e-96bc-ed9f9f810447-0
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:42.018
And out of the water, what looks
to be water, anyway, comes some

ab9d0ec0-da91-4a7e-96bc-ed9f9f810447-1
01:17:42.018 --> 01:17:44.230
strange looking turtles.

c29a36a2-a870-4316-b1bd-d02cbe6a5a7a-0
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:45.830
Umm.

e667f54d-1d04-4da1-8eda-c7efe7bdb266-0
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.690
On the left side of the picture
is the hat.

de1a03e8-dacd-40d9-ac6d-ba8cbbded12b-0
01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:53.797
It's floating But it's been
stopped by turtles that have

de1a03e8-dacd-40d9-ac6d-ba8cbbded12b-1
01:17:53.797 --> 01:17:57.070
come up out of the water who are
curious about what this is.

0383600f-f616-450b-adec-7a30307ad800-0
01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:01.294
And one of the birds has also
flown down and is floating on

0383600f-f616-450b-adec-7a30307ad800-1
01:18:01.294 --> 01:18:03.190
the water looking into the hats.

915979c0-2973-48ef-9725-45d825b608eb-0
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.500
Umm but.

1377b5e5-f998-4143-b0c5-9c112ca9242a-0
01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.010
It seems like the.

1d40b859-3deb-4753-9268-ec57ac677eb1-0
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:10.840
Turtles have decided that.

e63458e0-6ad8-46d4-90f7-ce1b497bee16-0
01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.683
They're going to let the hat
pass and it floats on towards a

e63458e0-6ad8-46d4-90f7-ce1b497bee16-1
01:18:16.683 --> 01:18:17.140
large.

a42393fb-fdde-4fe4-8b06-d769d131508c-0
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:21.860
Something. You can't tell what
it is, but it's a large.

c10fb4c0-c587-41a8-a683-ce8612cb4456-0
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.911
brick, rock formation or some
kind of formation coming out of

c10fb4c0-c587-41a8-a683-ce8612cb4456-1
01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:33.044
the water and the birds are
flying are a bird is flying past

c10fb4c0-c587-41a8-a683-ce8612cb4456-2
01:18:33.044 --> 01:18:35.620
it and it's got big white dots
on it.

50384056-cb83-4d23-a746-bb7bf90fe0d4-0
01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:40.970
And as we.

b6b10c89-5665-41cd-82c4-7f1ff8316a88-0
01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:47.410
As the page has turned, the hat
is stuck on.

90eaaa4a-5fb7-4ecd-bbf6-9f276e9cfa1c-0
01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:55.480
This large, it looks like what
is now a fin of a whale.

c250246c-cc6b-4610-bbad-e015ebceaf83-0
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.890
Umm.

2fefedc2-78f0-4d30-928a-b0c15867dc61-0
01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.560
The whale.

87fd23b0-c54a-4acf-a075-f760e113a427-0
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.350
wanted to. {Oh, I'm sorry.
Shoot.

6dad66e3-d535-4fff-ad5e-656673e01630-0
01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:05.040
I'm sorry, can I take a moment?

6aa7be5a-a892-4ed9-b127-070c9d103bd7-0
01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.590
I'm sorry.

cc1e5c5b-6a26-4255-a4c9-ff75a581f4b9-0
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.530
So with that.

c0957501-e7a2-4f48-93b2-8e931089e380-0
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.710
Alright, let's OK.

98a0352e-b8e1-4944-ad97-10a6919e1a57-0
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:50.230
I think. }

89566a5e-3e25-4e74-9e12-ee4cf9bff858-0
01:19:54.630 --> 01:20:00.085
So it looks like there's the
whale has decided that it would

89566a5e-3e25-4e74-9e12-ee4cf9bff858-1
01:20:00.085 --> 01:20:05.720
like to wear the paper hats or
the paper boat, and has found a

89566a5e-3e25-4e74-9e12-ee4cf9bff858-2
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.549
way to get it onto his fin, his
dorsal fin, and he's.

75413ad2-0cd9-4a79-ae67-641a9d7d4277-0
01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.530
Swimming through the water so
that it's kind of sticking out

75413ad2-0cd9-4a79-ae67-641a9d7d4277-1
01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:16.120
in the hat is above the water.

8b103798-38ba-4ea3-a4d4-c005ad66b753-0
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:19.700
And underneath the water there
is.

ce8d6f39-9884-46dc-a85a-b64c0fb850ab-0
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:21.900
Beautiful.

a7f2d6c8-d606-454a-9c50-2b60e2200c88-0
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.650
Fish life.

500a34e4-2da6-4612-bda1-9c82e6de0c2d-0
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:29.750
And you see on the next page
there's, well, there's a

500a34e4-2da6-4612-bda1-9c82e6de0c2d-1
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:34.950
swordfish and lots of schools of
little fish swimming around the

500a34e4-2da6-4612-bda1-9c82e6de0c2d-2
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:35.750
swordfish.

c7d4008c-f96d-468c-be13-09d26446a558-0
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:42.213
And on the right side of the
page there are lots of fish

c7d4008c-f96d-468c-be13-09d26446a558-1
01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:44.880
swimming through the water and.

aaff4f4f-58b5-4456-a903-e7a5cfca9b31-0
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.770
Algae and coral that's filled
with life with fish.

3280395c-358d-4796-a0f2-560b85993283-0
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.870
Tiger fish and.

53f289ac-dea8-43c8-9b22-37d15c5d59f8-0
01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:01.160
Just many different kinds of
fish.

3e420fe3-7197-45f7-a822-18e233811f57-0
01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.720
And coral.

e38f7759-b0c9-46ca-9167-49c63cd0f98f-0
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:05.660
Next page.

b6afd134-c397-4fbc-9849-59bb3c85bbf2-0
01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:13.861
This picture is of these two
pictures are of the coral life

b6afd134-c397-4fbc-9849-59bb3c85bbf2-1
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:17.580
underneath the water again and
that the.

d4b40f95-300b-4b0d-b225-5139e437efab-0
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:21.320
The whale seems to have.

9b2089df-7fd2-48e9-9a68-bc84548aa9d8-0
01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:27.270
Let go of the hat boat and it's
floating again.

2b7bd2ef-de2f-44f7-b48b-655bdd903b5f-0
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.548
And it has floated up on top of
some other fish, some smaller

2b7bd2ef-de2f-44f7-b48b-655bdd903b5f-1
01:21:33.548 --> 01:21:37.804
fish that are in a big school.
So I don't know if once they go

2b7bd2ef-de2f-44f7-b48b-655bdd903b5f-2
01:21:37.804 --> 01:21:42.195
into the water the boat the the
hat will float on, or if they've

2b7bd2ef-de2f-44f7-b48b-655bdd903b5f-3
01:21:42.195 --> 01:21:46.518
decided that they want to wear
it. But for now the hat is stuck

2b7bd2ef-de2f-44f7-b48b-655bdd903b5f-4
01:21:46.518 --> 01:21:48.410
on this large group of fish.

115782c3-82eb-46b5-b5ca-9dac1bbfec15-0
01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:55.471
And underneath them are just
another beautiful view of

115782c3-82eb-46b5-b5ca-9dac1bbfec15-1
01:21:55.471 --> 01:22:02.516
underwater life, of coral and
fish who live in the coral and

115782c3-82eb-46b5-b5ca-9dac1bbfec15-2
01:22:02.516 --> 01:22:07.020
big schools of fish who swim
together.

41874b5d-4840-454f-b1fc-3e20f8dafbc5-0
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:10.330
Next page.

df0b5d8b-56e6-4e52-9d5e-38cbdf1d2a2b-0
01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.290
So the hat

e73d4b54-4f3c-4876-97f0-d49f4515eed6-0
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:17.150
Is floating on.

cb71494a-3c43-42eb-853c-b519811ac7bd-0
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:23.520
And it looks like underneath the
on the first page.

434c29b8-3327-4b78-bfd5-f2742bd95fce-0
01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.470
Underneath the hat.

605a4dd3-d071-49bc-9a41-4aaa73b704db-0
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:33.249
Are again another scene of of
life, of underwater life, of

605a4dd3-d071-49bc-9a41-4aaa73b704db-1
01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:35.730
coral fish. And there are two.

6e647e1c-14be-4b32-9be9-39564e1f2846-0
01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.530
Strange looking fish.

4162caf6-7db5-43a1-a370-c3057bfbf3d0-0
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:40.900
That are.

699cc1f4-705f-41e1-bf60-08944709eacf-0
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:46.150
Hiding behind a piece of coral.

8a9fa60a-ee37-4b81-ab47-0593c49c4111-0
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:51.365
That's flowing and they are
kissing. They are kissing fish.

8a9fa60a-ee37-4b81-ab47-0593c49c4111-1
01:22:51.365 --> 01:22:55.845
They have arms and hands and
fingers and hands, but they have

8a9fa60a-ee37-4b81-ab47-0593c49c4111-2
01:22:55.845 --> 01:22:56.639
fish heads.

9a01091d-1eb2-42b5-a774-c013d809eed5-0
01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:01.183
And it's the fish heads that are
kissing, but they also have

9a01091d-1eb2-42b5-a774-c013d809eed5-1
01:23:01.183 --> 01:23:01.620
bodies.

52feaa93-7526-44c4-b6ed-0c320ba98f18-0
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:06.932
And under coming out of the hat
that's now floating on the

52feaa93-7526-44c4-b6ed-0c320ba98f18-1
01:23:06.932 --> 01:23:10.159
water, or what looks like
tentacles or some kind of

52feaa93-7526-44c4-b6ed-0c320ba98f18-2
01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:13.449
spaghetti strings hanging down
from the hat now. And

52feaa93-7526-44c4-b6ed-0c320ba98f18-3
01:23:13.449 --> 01:23:15.560
something's happening to the
hat.

9a11d74f-6730-4c44-8159-ea349e2b1a41-0
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:19.350
Something else has attached
itself to the hat.

08d389c3-e98d-4eda-802f-1b78dcd05694-0
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.300
And I can't really tell what it
is.

5b9d7314-9fac-4a78-b30b-fce66d0dee18-0
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:23.740
Umm.

e1d15ccc-255a-452e-a9ec-dfd991e4a77a-0
01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:26.500
But.

9c294112-c6a7-472b-a97d-1a5dd87686f3-0
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.369
The next page shows that there's
a fishing pole, something has

9c294112-c6a7-472b-a97d-1a5dd87686f3-1
01:23:31.369 --> 01:23:35.354
gotten into the hat and is now
fishing, and there's a fishing

9c294112-c6a7-472b-a97d-1a5dd87686f3-2
01:23:35.354 --> 01:23:39.210
pole coming and, and there's
still the the the filaments or

9c294112-c6a7-472b-a97d-1a5dd87686f3-3
01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:41.460
the tentacles coming from the
hat.

a840c669-2517-4af9-b08a-3b114a0e9066-0
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:43.620
Into the water.

83c7a0f9-54c2-407f-8943-c2799d831dd5-0
01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:51.120
But attached to the fishing pole
of fish has taken the bait and.

822f255f-684c-454d-86e9-0871579a63ea-0
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:56.040
has um now stuck to the pole.

39e9427a-fa25-4fe7-8863-ddb4c4d32acb-0
01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:01.340
And the other there are more
human looking fish.

9261bc63-0ad0-410e-bc5e-6b3ef209e9ee-0
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:07.355
One of them has a pair of
scissors in his hand and it

9261bc63-0ad0-410e-bc5e-6b3ef209e9ee-1
01:24:07.355 --> 01:24:11.890
looks like he's going to cut the
line so the little fish can go

9261bc63-0ad0-410e-bc5e-6b3ef209e9ee-2
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:13.520
free and not be caught.

27074d66-e7cb-466f-a396-dae4b083a3ac-0
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:18.698
Um, while the other fish are
watching this happen, there are

27074d66-e7cb-466f-a396-dae4b083a3ac-1
01:24:18.698 --> 01:24:22.546
some striped fish and other
schools of fish that are

27074d66-e7cb-466f-a396-dae4b083a3ac-2
01:24:22.546 --> 01:24:26.540
watching this human looking fish
cut the fishing line.

e311052c-2c21-4cf1-928a-8f360b29f5ff-0
01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:27.920
Turn the page.

3acc5f5a-5e68-4cf9-af1b-d566ce71499c-0
01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:41.030
In this picture, the first
picture of the two.

82cc71d4-7d3f-444c-bbc5-e1092af8e73c-0
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:47.563
The fish has decided that they
want to know what this is, so

82cc71d4-7d3f-444c-bbc5-e1092af8e73c-1
01:24:47.563 --> 01:24:52.598
they form a, one Fish, gets up
on the top of a piece of coral

82cc71d4-7d3f-444c-bbc5-e1092af8e73c-2
01:24:52.598 --> 01:24:57.713
and another fish stands on his
head and they look into the hat

82cc71d4-7d3f-444c-bbc5-e1092af8e73c-3
01:24:57.713 --> 01:24:58.120
boat.

eb4ef031-22eb-47d4-b8e4-f82ac7dc5b6e-0
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:03.500
And there's still the filaments
coming from the hats.

8a7d2ea1-2465-4291-823b-6e869d2cd667-0
01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:08.623
It's very hard to say what that
is, but underneath the coral,

8a7d2ea1-2465-4291-823b-6e869d2cd667-1
01:25:08.623 --> 01:25:12.757
where the two fish are standing
looking into the fish hat, there

8a7d2ea1-2465-4291-823b-6e869d2cd667-2
01:25:12.757 --> 01:25:13.330
are more.

c083d522-5b80-4496-93d6-da17dbade162-0
01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.010
Striped swimming around.

2a65ca5e-0be2-45f0-9cfc-4b5809713adc-0
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:20.610
Waiting to find out what's
happening.

86a15bd1-c806-49b0-91e9-32fd0e009834-0
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.350
And this filament.

9087546f-8510-4380-b8cd-0ab6d16da84e-0
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.650
I just noticed is also.

f82c6ca9-cabd-499c-a221-bc64cdc3659d-0
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:31.630
Starting to come down from the
coral. It's strings. I can't

f82c6ca9-cabd-499c-a221-bc64cdc3659d-1
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:33.640
really tell what they are but.

eab074a5-0267-44f5-a861-5dbe342570ee-0
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:34.960
Umm.

40adff5d-2f5d-45c2-bcc2-faea95ac3c9b-0
01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:39.790
Anyway, it's looking like the
water is filling up with this

40adff5d-2f5d-45c2-bcc2-faea95ac3c9b-1
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:41.620
string that's coming from this.

806e57e3-ebc4-403c-98c2-47bf19fadb42-0
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:47.671
Little hat and on the next page
there's a Stingray that also

806e57e3-ebc4-403c-98c2-47bf19fadb42-1
01:25:47.671 --> 01:25:52.755
has, that's swimming around that
also has this filament or these

806e57e3-ebc4-403c-98c2-47bf19fadb42-2
01:25:52.755 --> 01:25:56.510
strings flowing from it down to
the sea bottom.

28e5f7d2-f9d3-4305-bc1a-f12d1dbce14b-0
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:01.489
And out of the sea bottom are
these little worms, I think

28e5f7d2-f9d3-4305-bc1a-f12d1dbce14b-1
01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:05.902
they're called sea worms, that
have all popped their heads up

28e5f7d2-f9d3-4305-bc1a-f12d1dbce14b-2
01:26:05.902 --> 01:26:10.387
out of the sand wondering what's
happening because, and one of

28e5f7d2-f9d3-4305-bc1a-f12d1dbce14b-3
01:26:10.387 --> 01:26:12.310
them is so curious that he.

83a362a2-9097-4f4a-a3ff-aa0aa14decd0-0
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:14.250
{Ohh.

a1c3553c-8503-4c15-a9a8-fd8612ee5568-0
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:18.010
That might be losing battery.}

028e717d-9a39-4ca5-acca-4b31efd7a1da-0
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.026
One of the sea worms is so
curious that he stretches as

028e717d-9a39-4ca5-acca-4b31efd7a1da-1
01:26:24.026 --> 01:26:28.690
high as he can up to look into
the boat at the top of the.

7c91af85-7900-4cd4-bc82-5eb91b2ab1a4-0
01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:31.090
The water. And he sees that.

2e30692d-5020-42e3-a7c8-8dc85fc1ee54-0
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.720
One of the.

d0c20c9a-fa47-4b58-9709-d0dc2affcff5-0
01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.050
fish

f33b85e3-38dc-49f8-8b29-f62a6d1e55a1-0
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:37.120
Has gotten into the boat.

a85dc4ee-32e9-49ab-a9b4-a4d7cbf2bb5f-0
01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:38.620
Umm.

82938cb6-887a-4e8e-b5e7-42600bfe57f9-0
01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:42.050
And anyway, so that next page.

5d11443e-ba6a-4cc1-898c-e66228b1037f-0
01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.300
Oh, I see there are.

0d593d86-d18b-4e43-a387-e5ffc6888b4e-0
01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:58.360
Lots of these Stingrays. There's
a whole school of Stingrays.

3160b679-5ded-4e0e-9675-30865265b60a-0
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.910
Floating by.

cc135fce-79c9-4f13-8bbc-c32836f0aa19-0
01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.790
Underneath the boat.

18e9628d-cb9e-4d0c-9d11-913a97ece41d-0
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:06.740
OK, next page.

4c680be8-473d-4116-be88-bb61983f8d57-0
01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:16.710
So the hat is having has now
picked up a passenger.

2be981e7-5d9a-45f7-9a03-236fc182a6c1-0
01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.340
A little.

e031a305-2116-49db-aebe-95d5f7b33dfb-0
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:25.120
Some kind of little sea worm
fish.

594c41ca-4234-4822-9090-1d1ab47d7231-0
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:31.659
And anyway, he's continuing his
trip and comes to a large group,

594c41ca-4234-4822-9090-1d1ab47d7231-1
01:27:31.659 --> 01:27:32.360
a large.

1562c639-2f5a-4a2b-a65f-d9e186395d81-0
01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:34.320
Umm.

65f5611d-f259-414a-8cb2-c81765a8fe6b-0
01:27:36.570 --> 01:27:39.940
Group of trees in the middle of
the.

3eb60dff-d5ba-40d0-9e57-efe29faa34fe-0
01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:45.550
Or water, and in the trees sit
these beautiful herons and

3eb60dff-d5ba-40d0-9e57-efe29faa34fe-1
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:49.880
cranes. White herons and cranes
are sitting in the trees.

aa2ccad7-cd50-45f4-86ee-08371891d736-0
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:57.610
And starting to grow from the
water are flowers, white flowers

aa2ccad7-cd50-45f4-86ee-08371891d736-1
01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:03.582
that look like daisies and so
the in the first page the the

aa2ccad7-cd50-45f4-86ee-08371891d736-2
01:28:03.582 --> 01:28:06.270
hat is just floating along.

c3edb80f-0c9e-4eba-a512-9905594048d6-0
01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.640
Heading towards the the past.

4f7eb116-b29d-426c-91ad-52f95c9cb3dc-0
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:16.580
Floating past this, these trees
full of these birds, these

4f7eb116-b29d-426c-91ad-52f95c9cb3dc-1
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.961
beautiful long necked birds of
herons and cranes and maybe even

4f7eb116-b29d-426c-91ad-52f95c9cb3dc-2
01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:22.550
egrets.

78bd63c2-e0bc-42a0-961a-1522a3acf67c-0
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:26.800
OK, next page.

c937cbf7-16a6-4ad6-86f4-64257f7de3a7-0
01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.041
And they have decided to go in
amongst the trees to check out

c937cbf7-16a6-4ad6-86f4-64257f7de3a7-1
01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:36.810
the birds.

0f42aeb8-8d9f-472f-88c6-b2f99c53d322-0
01:28:38.530 --> 01:28:39.370
So.

6df233c6-a6bb-44b9-a47f-d990ca7ed6e9-0
01:28:40.130 --> 01:28:45.093
The page is divided into 2
sections. The top section is of

6df233c6-a6bb-44b9-a47f-d990ca7ed6e9-1
01:28:45.093 --> 01:28:50.141
the tree with the birds and it
shows the roots of the trees

6df233c6-a6bb-44b9-a47f-d990ca7ed6e9-2
01:28:50.141 --> 01:28:55.189
that the birds are in and the
roots are going down into the

6df233c6-a6bb-44b9-a47f-d990ca7ed6e9-3
01:28:55.189 --> 01:29:00.237
water and under the water are
more beautiful fish, fish who

6df233c6-a6bb-44b9-a47f-d990ca7ed6e9-4
01:29:00.237 --> 01:29:01.500
live there and.

deaf2975-1b5d-4696-a591-72a72518f188-0
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:07.367
There's actually a big shark
looking fish in the background

deaf2975-1b5d-4696-a591-72a72518f188-1
01:29:07.367 --> 01:29:11.880
and there's more coral and the
fish live in the roots of these

deaf2975-1b5d-4696-a591-72a72518f188-2
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.309
trees.

78c8beb3-55cf-4fb8-ab17-fa3ddb803e30-0
01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:17.140
And on this this second page as
the.

1c9938ce-658b-4c6f-9736-2d263ff66d57-0
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.105
As the hat is passing through or
passing into the area where the

1c9938ce-658b-4c6f-9736-2d263ff66d57-1
01:29:23.105 --> 01:29:27.504
trees are, there are more
schools of fish and there's a

1c9938ce-658b-4c6f-9736-2d263ff66d57-2
01:29:27.504 --> 01:29:29.390
starfish underneath and.

fc439120-6d58-4efa-adc0-0ed157a2150a-0
01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:34.901
There are fish with white eyes
watching, watching the whole

fc439120-6d58-4efa-adc0-0ed157a2150a-1
01:29:34.901 --> 01:29:38.915
scene, and there's a large
school of fish swimming through

fc439120-6d58-4efa-adc0-0ed157a2150a-2
01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:40.480
the roots of the trees.

b4e02ad7-bf5f-474a-a48e-438492ae2fc2-0
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:43.880
But the hat just passes by.

3dfe52a1-67b1-463c-8d63-4d401cb4e09a-0
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.850
Next page.

40ae68ce-3306-45f0-ab38-69c733ac01cd-0
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:55.275
And the hat is getting deeper
and deeper into the forest of

40ae68ce-3306-45f0-ab38-69c733ac01cd-1
01:29:55.275 --> 01:29:55.700
trees.

5e38da14-9041-4098-882d-7a2a57992f10-0
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:57.220
And.

adefb9cf-e37d-4cf9-969a-fc2d6ad80242-0
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:07.714
Up in the trees, in addition to
the white birds that you don't

adefb9cf-e37d-4cf9-969a-fc2d6ad80242-1
01:30:07.714 --> 01:30:12.701
see anymore, there are other
kinds of animals. And there's

adefb9cf-e37d-4cf9-969a-fc2d6ad80242-2
01:30:12.701 --> 01:30:17.941
another type of bird, a little
dark bird, who's sitting up on

adefb9cf-e37d-4cf9-969a-fc2d6ad80242-3
01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:21.660
the tree branch, and other birds
that have.

1ce8f2c5-c55f-41b3-8836-bc2f7579059e-0
01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.860
White eyes watching.

aa7fe434-d852-4e24-a36b-4447ad762be6-0
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.150
Watching the hat pass by.

13b86960-2c00-453d-b21a-f5f42bb6523b-0
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:32.020
And he still has.

8f5a687e-2685-4d36-aeed-ddb59c60536b-0
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.570
A little.

4f29f3b0-6e92-4e7a-9ed8-63bb4daae15d-0
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.220
He's still oh, I guess it's a.
What is this called?

12824183-f538-480c-9d45-81515757c2ce-0
01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.610
Can't think of it. He has a
little passenger in his hat.

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-0
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:50.606
Also has a little hat on his
head now, and as they're

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-1
01:30:50.606 --> 01:30:55.099
floating past and through these
trees, there are lots of

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-2
01:30:55.099 --> 01:30:59.750
creatures with white eyes
looking at them as they pass by,

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-3
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:04.638
and they're actually something
with hands reaching out to the

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-4
01:31:04.638 --> 01:31:09.525
boat. The little hat boat as
it's floating by, but it doesn't

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-5
01:31:09.525 --> 01:31:14.491
seem to be in any danger yet.
Although it could be a dangerous

f5018604-d65f-4520-ab0b-95a8a084eaf6-6
01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:16.620
scene, it's getting darker.

eaca963d-a578-4c32-84b4-b1423142a6c6-0
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.400
OK, next.

f70f0be4-9325-4fbf-8acf-83e4680fdecf-0
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.560
OK, so.

1fb33b1f-f1b1-4588-a66f-71852b7948e2-0
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:29.803
The Hat has made its way through
the forest of trees that had the

1fb33b1f-f1b1-4588-a66f-71852b7948e2-1
01:31:29.803 --> 01:31:32.400
birds in it, and this picture is
also.

caa252ab-6681-4cc9-90bc-17e1a6eab54c-0
01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:35.550
Shows, uh,

38300054-713d-4890-b124-87673a69f55b-0
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:40.487
Above water and about. Well,
about 1/3 above water and 2/3

38300054-713d-4890-b124-87673a69f55b-1
01:31:40.487 --> 01:31:44.484
below water. Above the water,
the little creature that's

38300054-713d-4890-b124-87673a69f55b-2
01:31:44.484 --> 01:31:47.780
floating in the hat, he looks
like a seahorse.

2b678e7c-6f79-42eb-a105-e092a1100077-0
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.130
Looks out into the water and
realizes that.

be24b804-15b5-4f84-9076-91d50fdb58b2-0
01:31:55.570 --> 01:31:56.590


ac7d8490-65e7-4c52-bbca-83750d2de860-0
01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:01.316
He sees something underneath,
something different. There's

ac7d8490-65e7-4c52-bbca-83750d2de860-1
01:32:01.316 --> 01:32:01.950
actually.

d32adafe-1be9-4be4-b2cb-f48aa8a057c4-0
01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:08.810
A kind of shellfish. No, not a
shrimp.

8c3487a4-e176-4547-a773-9b50a4c746b5-0
01:32:10.330 --> 01:32:12.190
Some kind of shellfish.

f0d6c688-2038-4611-985e-617949a304b0-0
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.115
Eyes and tentacles come up out
of the water to look at the

f0d6c688-2038-4611-985e-617949a304b0-1
01:32:19.115 --> 01:32:21.310
little seahorse in the hat.

b43ea303-3a81-444c-939b-0e8f0c0e8d70-0
01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.870
And there's another shellfish
that's riding this.

c03785f9-821e-4736-abf1-c8e661fccaac-0
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:29.880
Lobster. That's what it looks
like.

3e8c9dbd-16fb-471c-85b1-f642c09eaecf-0
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:35.024
And they're riding past, but
they see as as the lobster's

3e8c9dbd-16fb-471c-85b1-f642c09eaecf-1
01:32:35.024 --> 01:32:39.280
eyes reach up out of the water
and see the hat they're just

3e8c9dbd-16fb-471c-85b1-f642c09eaecf-2
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.260
riding past and take and observe
the hat.

93ff2024-c812-487a-99cb-d5becdf05dc0-0
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:45.860
And on the next page, the hat
has exited the.

f0858f7f-d7db-446d-b304-aa595c53ff35-0
01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.670
The forest of trees and.

bf65dd3d-fa17-4cf4-85f8-8bd13efc2175-0
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.797
The little seahorse that was in
the hat sees that his friends

bf65dd3d-fa17-4cf4-85f8-8bd13efc2175-1
01:32:56.797 --> 01:33:01.365
have been following him and are
they called back to him to come.

bf65dd3d-fa17-4cf4-85f8-8bd13efc2175-2
01:33:01.365 --> 01:33:05.933
When he jumps out of the hat and
he loses his own little hat, it

bf65dd3d-fa17-4cf4-85f8-8bd13efc2175-3
01:33:05.933 --> 01:33:07.620
goes back into the boat.

f1ca7135-2797-49ab-a13f-d2859ccc312f-0
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:14.356
And he goes back into the sea
where his friends are and where

f1ca7135-2797-49ab-a13f-d2859ccc312f-1
01:33:14.356 --> 01:33:16.620
it's inhabited by other.

6edfba73-e7e5-42d2-a692-87f89c9a129d-0
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:23.960
New types of fish. I see an eel
and some other flowers and.

8e202c17-b487-4faf-aa67-32858aa2f3ff-0
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.740
Different unique kinds of sea
life.

f49a645c-bae6-4258-a7e0-b4401ceb92ea-0
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:32.510
And the and the hat is floating
on.

3ba21347-9ef7-4d76-9be3-7b34a164bc8e-0
01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.880
Turn the page.

776208df-c914-4038-911f-501d2a4d773f-0
01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:45.430
In this picture on the left hand
side we see a what looks like a

776208df-c914-4038-911f-501d2a4d773f-1
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:47.200
whale and the whale.

5aa4bade-26ef-4f1b-bff3-e6d72de9b00d-0
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.510
Is.

1e77e274-1dd4-4b0f-b3f6-14849fae86f9-0
01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:53.810
Instead of floating horizontally
in the water, it's floating

1e77e274-1dd4-4b0f-b3f6-14849fae86f9-1
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:55.400
vertically in the water.

5d2e7cd3-1c32-472d-a57f-28447955a66d-0
01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.042
And you can't. If you were
floating on top of the water,

5d2e7cd3-1c32-472d-a57f-28447955a66d-1
01:34:00.042 --> 01:34:02.270
you would not know that it's a
whale, because.

482865a3-4ac4-4b77-9f81-4ec798de759f-0
01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:08.365
Almost all of the whale is
underneath the water, except for

482865a3-4ac4-4b77-9f81-4ec798de759f-1
01:34:08.365 --> 01:34:13.641
what looks just like a big rock
on top of the water and on top

482865a3-4ac4-4b77-9f81-4ec798de759f-2
01:34:13.641 --> 01:34:14.730
of this rock.

f4026238-f126-43bb-9984-fdd47ac98a52-0
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.880
Are birds sitting there enjoying

41f6a4be-edc0-411c-bec3-20bc89753d74-0
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.729
Their sun, enjoying the sun and
and the ability to rest after

41f6a4be-edc0-411c-bec3-20bc89753d74-1
01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:26.938
flying for so long, and there's
also a pipe with smoke coming

41f6a4be-edc0-411c-bec3-20bc89753d74-2
01:34:26.938 --> 01:34:29.450
out of the rock. Maybe the whale
is.

e7057cbb-040d-4407-859b-b184b7fffc98-0
01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.418
Smoking a pipe, but anyway,
underneath the water where you

e7057cbb-040d-4407-859b-b184b7fffc98-1
01:34:33.418 --> 01:34:35.600
would be able to see that it's a
whale.

c34954a1-7c99-44dd-8f84-4486086a7253-0
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:40.783
You can see the underside of the
whale and his fins, and there

c34954a1-7c99-44dd-8f84-4486086a7253-1
01:34:40.783 --> 01:34:45.136
are some little fish that are
swimming around him and there's

c34954a1-7c99-44dd-8f84-4486086a7253-2
01:34:45.136 --> 01:34:49.629
also some more tentacles or some
filaments that are coming from

c34954a1-7c99-44dd-8f84-4486086a7253-3
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:53.070
the whale and what that is yet
on the next page.

f797ca6c-13a4-4b5d-8d42-264d78a37518-0
01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:59.160
The whale, oh is a new creature
that the Hat

b98d07e2-260a-47fb-ad75-eeaed43f01a7-0
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:01.800
Has floated towards.

c2a38c65-382f-405d-a5a0-66937a184037-0
01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.150
Umm.

1a4db3ec-3942-47fb-93ae-480a2f5c97e8-0
01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.370
Looks very similar to the first.

0de820fe-21f4-4c67-9cc3-a70919f998fd-0
01:35:10.630 --> 01:35:14.530
Whale, the whale on the other
page, except this creature,

0de820fe-21f4-4c67-9cc3-a70919f998fd-1
01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:18.902
which is also underwater for the
most part and only looks like a

0de820fe-21f4-4c67-9cc3-a70919f998fd-2
01:35:18.902 --> 01:35:20.920
rock on top of the water, has.

b2ff214f-0db4-44ec-a383-bf4519bef0b0-0
01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:27.525
A hook or a pole with something
hanging from it. I can't really

b2ff214f-0db4-44ec-a383-bf4519bef0b0-1
01:35:27.525 --> 01:35:33.180
tell what it is, but underneath
the water is a creature that's

b2ff214f-0db4-44ec-a383-bf4519bef0b0-2
01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:38.297
very interesting. It's black
with these big pincher arms

b2ff214f-0db4-44ec-a383-bf4519bef0b0-3
01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:41.170
coming out of it and a colorful.

758e2217-44dc-4ef5-b233-5247b7ae3ffb-0
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:48.909
Coral tail and coral coming off
its back and its mouth is full

758e2217-44dc-4ef5-b233-5247b7ae3ffb-1
01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:53.604
of very sharp teeth with a
bright white eye. But the little

758e2217-44dc-4ef5-b233-5247b7ae3ffb-2
01:35:53.604 --> 01:35:57.360
hat can't see this. It's
floating on the water.

9bf923dd-1765-4e37-909c-859de174c783-0
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:02.760
The only people who can see what
this creature looks like is.

6ed3ea88-996b-497e-ae0c-8dc2a109dc85-0
01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:07.767
People that can see under the
water like us as we're looking

6ed3ea88-996b-497e-ae0c-8dc2a109dc85-1
01:36:07.767 --> 01:36:11.440
at the page and this creature is
standing on a boat.

876bcb36-0619-48ef-aa1b-ceb11ba4753e-0
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:15.620
or a pile of old boats that have
sunk.

76febefa-a4f6-46f4-a964-7679708e59ad-0
01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:19.850
Maybe it actually destroyed
these boats. There's.

47b85aaf-4127-4fba-8ff6-a6dfea00316d-0
01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:26.800
I see the boats and their old
masts that are just in a pile.

cac31f88-33f7-4a69-8133-de34971e32b4-0
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.050
Next page.

600a7a02-ee18-4704-81d1-b68d216edb66-0
01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.560
These two pages are a picture
of.

01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:43.766
Many different creatures. We
are. No, I guess we. I can't

55c83256-6792-4781-9728-d3569fbb9dba-1
01:36:43.766 --> 01:36:46.847
tell if we're on the sea
anymore. Actually, we are.

55c83256-6792-4781-9728-d3569fbb9dba-2
01:36:46.847 --> 01:36:50.521
There's the hat. It was almost
disguised. I couldn't find it.

55c83256-6792-4781-9728-d3569fbb9dba-3
01:36:50.521 --> 01:36:53.010
But there's the hat. He's still
floating.

f33ca779-984d-4683-8f31-c02d97dcab43-0
01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:58.781
But this scene is taking place
on top of the water, and like

f33ca779-984d-4683-8f31-c02d97dcab43-1
01:36:58.781 --> 01:37:03.749
underneath the water, it's
fantastical. There are all kinds

f33ca779-984d-4683-8f31-c02d97dcab43-2
01:37:03.749 --> 01:37:08.470
of creatures. There are flying
creatures, um birds with.

5e184133-6fb3-487c-a6d7-8fca963e996a-0
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:15.222
Striped wings and tails that
look like fins. The dorsal fin

5e184133-6fb3-487c-a6d7-8fca963e996a-1
01:37:15.222 --> 01:37:20.957
of a of of a shark and there is
actually a shark floating

5e184133-6fb3-487c-a6d7-8fca963e996a-2
01:37:20.957 --> 01:37:22.540
through the air.

b84359fb-6e93-431a-96a8-351b4b36985d-0
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:24.690
And there are.

4bf62f6c-df0b-45d0-a318-c3fb02e12d53-0
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:30.881
Birds that with a hat that looks
like a jester hat and a body

4bf62f6c-df0b-45d0-a318-c3fb02e12d53-1
01:37:30.881 --> 01:37:34.800
that looks like a jester body
with triangles on it.

5afc64eb-7452-459e-bf4f-c835734203fe-0
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:41.578
And then there's a there's a
fish that looks like the moon.

5afc64eb-7452-459e-bf4f-c835734203fe-1
01:37:41.578 --> 01:37:42.140
That's.

b8ae72d3-fe97-4990-84c1-fe8e79931f5a-0
01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:47.969
Got all kinds of different
shapes on it, with a tail and a

b8ae72d3-fe97-4990-84c1-fe8e79931f5a-1
01:37:47.969 --> 01:37:52.717
little mouth and eyes on one
end, but it's colorful and and

b8ae72d3-fe97-4990-84c1-fe8e79931f5a-2
01:37:52.717 --> 01:37:56.200
light like the moon and it's up
in the sky.

d40bd92a-d1dd-4179-9a71-20869d661879-0
01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.250
And on top of the water.

be138da0-9d6f-4bf0-87eb-1bc143a6e3c7-0
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:05.569
There are there's a creature
like an elephant that he has

be138da0-9d6f-4bf0-87eb-1bc143a6e3c7-1
01:38:05.569 --> 01:38:10.600
flowing ears and a lion and
horses and leopards, but all

be138da0-9d6f-4bf0-87eb-1bc143a6e3c7-2
01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.720
oddly shaped. They have fins for
hands and fins for feet.

e0c90758-6ec3-4b6f-bc6b-97e94f112995-0
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:20.990
Umm, and a cat jumping into the
hat.

93673a67-042e-4ef8-95c2-f9a863bc3759-0
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:24.750
A cat with a long tail and fin
feet.

94fa75a8-3711-44b1-a960-f6585aafae98-0
01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:30.620
And an aardvark looking creature
also.

b7528c82-1ff7-4537-80a1-78c3e030e21d-0
01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.720
Turn the page.

48e40484-aeb8-4035-a98b-3bec38458242-0
01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:45.082
So the hat floats on. It's
seeing many many different sites

48e40484-aeb8-4035-a98b-3bec38458242-1
01:38:45.082 --> 01:38:47.910
and creatures and nothing usual.

a63c62af-5103-4625-8c48-4847fc3add7a-0
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:53.480
And now it's just dark and it's
floating through.

304baf6a-4f99-4b28-b718-035b9481263d-0
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.060
The night.

7a1c0004-b8b0-40bd-883a-2f69fc853c70-0
01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:56.340
Umm.

d549892a-66ab-4027-a7a9-e59e708db425-0
01:38:57.270 --> 01:39:02.049
The sky is filled with stars,
bright stars and planets, and a

d549892a-66ab-4027-a7a9-e59e708db425-1
01:39:02.049 --> 01:39:07.059
and a Crescent moon and the. The
on the left side of the page is

d549892a-66ab-4027-a7a9-e59e708db425-2
01:39:07.059 --> 01:39:11.684
the hat, just floating across
the dark water and underneath

d549892a-66ab-4027-a7a9-e59e708db425-3
01:39:11.684 --> 01:39:13.380
are are are eyes just.

1e4976a3-123b-4800-8d7a-fbea3a1a7b90-0
01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.069
Pairs of eyes looking and
swimming through the water, but

1e4976a3-123b-4800-8d7a-fbea3a1a7b90-1
01:39:19.069 --> 01:39:23.063
the hat is unaware of these eyes
because he's on top of the water

1e4976a3-123b-4800-8d7a-fbea3a1a7b90-2
01:39:23.063 --> 01:39:26.150
and just floating. The only
thing the hat can see.

f0baed4a-335d-458c-b743-5c0965320d23-0
01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:33.410
Is the stars in the sky and and
the next page is just nothing.

f0baed4a-335d-458c-b743-5c0965320d23-1
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:38.504
It's just the the the eyes
underneath the water and the

f0baed4a-335d-458c-b743-5c0965320d23-2
01:39:38.504 --> 01:39:43.780
Crescent moon and the Milky Way
full of stars in the sky.

f439c62c-7335-4916-b3fc-c8618c4b7ba8-0
01:39:50.650 --> 01:39:54.731
Those eyes that were underneath
the water have now come to the

f439c62c-7335-4916-b3fc-c8618c4b7ba8-1
01:39:54.731 --> 01:39:58.813
surface of the water and have
surrounded the Hat. This picture

f439c62c-7335-4916-b3fc-c8618c4b7ba8-2
01:39:58.813 --> 01:39:59.849
is just full of.

99050f24-ec06-445b-bdc0-b91b8e18f5a2-0
01:40:00.570 --> 01:40:05.460
The hat is almost in the middle
of the picture and the fish.

31bf1527-2acd-4ebf-aa02-50b622ce8261-0
01:40:06.230 --> 01:40:09.567
With the glowing eyes have come
up out of the water and

31bf1527-2acd-4ebf-aa02-50b622ce8261-1
01:40:09.567 --> 01:40:12.070
surrounded the hat and are
looking at it.

4dc83f02-14d8-4e9c-8a01-25355c91a5fe-0
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.620
Hundreds of them.

97f2f29e-e8be-42ea-badc-4c771e1ab281-0
01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:19.832
And the hat is still white and
glowing, so they're wondering

97f2f29e-e8be-42ea-badc-4c771e1ab281-1
01:40:19.832 --> 01:40:21.270
what it is. Turn the page.

4d3ca187-4491-46da-813c-6e4cf3d851d1-0
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.297
And that the fish seemed to have
said OK, you're fine. And they

4d3ca187-4491-46da-813c-6e4cf3d851d1-1
01:40:29.297 --> 01:40:33.732
let the hat go and it's floats
along the fish have all turned

4d3ca187-4491-46da-813c-6e4cf3d851d1-2
01:40:33.732 --> 01:40:36.450
around and gone back under the
water.

8edf05c2-6270-4763-af72-634d65ac7bc7-0
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:42.080
But now flowing as the as the as
the hat is flowing along,

8edf05c2-6270-4763-af72-634d65ac7bc7-1
01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.260
floating along.

7f7a5039-de84-4bdb-a155-1bf040376c13-0
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.506
Out of the sky comes the Aurora
borealis, but it's a strange

7f7a5039-de84-4bdb-a155-1bf040376c13-1
01:40:49.506 --> 01:40:54.652
Aurora borealis. It's a it
starts lowering itself to the

7f7a5039-de84-4bdb-a155-1bf040376c13-2
01:40:54.652 --> 01:41:00.158
water, but it's in beautiful
ribbons above the Hat and it's,

7f7a5039-de84-4bdb-a155-1bf040376c13-3
01:41:00.158 --> 01:41:05.575
hangs down on filaments from the
sky and it is really quite

7f7a5039-de84-4bdb-a155-1bf040376c13-4
01:41:05.575 --> 01:41:10.991
lovely. And it fills up the
whole second page where the the

7f7a5039-de84-4bdb-a155-1bf040376c13-5
01:41:10.991 --> 01:41:13.790
the hat is floating towards it.

77f1434f-464e-40a4-8e24-f1a82c19e1ea-0
01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.220
It just covers the sky.

90c1daeb-2f40-4804-87bc-70ef8bd16e5c-0
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:17.850
Turn the page.

0bbe6482-b3f0-4763-a9af-27b5bd8074c6-0
01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:30.738
And as the hat floats on, it's
now floating. The first page

0bbe6482-b3f0-4763-a9af-27b5bd8074c6-1
01:41:30.738 --> 01:41:32.630
comes upon an iceberg.

976c3f20-0b30-40f8-9a4b-f79e85d6531d-0
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:39.017
That's an ice shelf actually
it's not pointed it has its flat

976c3f20-0b30-40f8-9a4b-f79e85d6531d-1
01:41:39.017 --> 01:41:43.560
top but it the has floating past
this ice shelf.

b92f85bb-1a49-438f-aaa8-8edfe8b5886d-0
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:45.000
Umm.

9a788970-f1ec-4569-b6e8-f722df3e7b93-0
01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:47.080
That's.

e904489b-3c0f-48e3-947f-18adb7e55240-0
01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:50.010
Takes up almost the whole page.

fbc7f43b-e680-4810-8c92-01c22fe766f7-0
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.737
Of the first page, and then gets
even bigger on the second page,

fbc7f43b-e680-4810-8c92-01c22fe766f7-1
01:41:55.737 --> 01:42:00.067
and the hat hasn't reached the
second page yet it's just

fbc7f43b-e680-4810-8c92-01c22fe766f7-2
01:42:00.067 --> 01:42:02.650
floating towards the second
page.

ea9b21a4-f64f-4fc9-a2b6-51a13f74732a-0
01:42:04.610 --> 01:42:05.580
But the ice

7d8e529a-7179-4429-a758-83f0b9254730-0
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:10.100
Shelf or the iceberg is just
floating.

943e122a-daac-451f-afd7-4b8cfffb899d-0
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.630
On the sea.

3cb10741-a0d4-4e68-b937-b977bee0427d-0
01:42:12.330 --> 01:42:13.020
Turn the page.

5d26b79b-3878-4de1-b23e-c35b7f425b58-0
01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:25.880
So we see that the hat has
floated north.

073b6696-8e21-4658-ae74-a13a325bbb51-0
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:31.187
As it comes to the cold regions
where it went past the iceberg

073b6696-8e21-4658-ae74-a13a325bbb51-1
01:42:31.187 --> 01:42:33.020
and now it's floating in.

3e56e988-d1ec-4c02-8bac-0067df2868a2-0
01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:37.980
Seas that are full of ice, small
ice.

a1e5904d-b286-4aa3-aa50-e222f54a9974-0
01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:45.449
Particle particles of ice
floating in the water and then

a1e5904d-b286-4aa3-aa50-e222f54a9974-1
01:42:45.449 --> 01:42:49.610
the first page it's floating
through a.

36376397-4d52-4396-82d6-16a55ac89f18-0
01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:52.360
A hole in the ice.

0a1929b6-5d03-4b2f-9622-f48ba54eecde-0
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:55.480
Would that be?

1b71544f-cdfc-42b6-8488-da4044047d66-0
01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.990
The water has created this hole
in the ice.

4181fd66-7b7d-4432-ba06-65c4119cdfa6-0
01:43:02.730 --> 01:43:06.139
And on the other side of the
hole are these beautiful trees

4181fd66-7b7d-4432-ba06-65c4119cdfa6-1
01:43:06.139 --> 01:43:09.377
that are covered with snow that
would almost look like a

4181fd66-7b7d-4432-ba06-65c4119cdfa6-2
01:43:09.377 --> 01:43:10.230
Christmas tree.

a1d46291-a77c-4ea6-bb4c-d5c135b37e87-0
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:16.632
But there are snow covered, so
he's obviously floating into a

a1d46291-a77c-4ea6-bb4c-d5c135b37e87-1
01:43:16.632 --> 01:43:19.830
very cold area and underneath
the ice.

2867a319-0338-48cd-878e-f1037e6bf3c2-0
01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:28.970
Floats are little tunnels, and
the shell or the the.

4dcba201-142d-43f6-9894-705d465f7861-0
01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:30.490
The hat

97e70e8b-6ba8-467d-8bb1-81f553607761-0
01:43:31.670 --> 01:43:34.330
Has floated into these tunnels.

18a257fd-02f6-43a5-ad79-3ea96c5f620e-0
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:38.170
And it's just trying to find his
way out.

d64dc907-ba72-4142-96e2-3a07c75199de-0
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:41.720
Ice tunnels.

85b8b5ad-6e5b-41c0-80d0-0566e507a498-0
01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:43.320
Turn the page please.

ce7bb460-5b91-4510-bff8-4a70fa75557e-0
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:53.620
So the.

a94e9458-f7f8-4668-bd3c-f36c69b6ec63-0
01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:59.210
Hat has made his way, floated
past the ice tunnels.

365b8f72-30f0-40a6-b539-30aa5e02321c-0
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:03.990
And is heading towards the open
sea when he comes.

2dd26b7b-e6dc-47c5-b53e-ab213448b630-0
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.300
across.

e99fe8f5-96be-4c45-a086-38afe1848e98-0
01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:11.262
Something that shines a light on
him. It's coming from the bottom

e99fe8f5-96be-4c45-a086-38afe1848e98-1
01:44:11.262 --> 01:44:13.100
of the ocean or underneath.

618420ac-184d-4afa-9803-e735bf05a16d-0
01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:17.097
And whatever it is, it's the
spotlight that has spotted the

618420ac-184d-4afa-9803-e735bf05a16d-1
01:44:17.097 --> 01:44:17.700
little hat.

cb0905dc-8ce7-4773-9c0e-559a2555946f-0
01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:26.010
And so on the next page it shows
a a a sea creature that has.

642a32e3-341f-4729-a4ab-a70b09c5ee44-0
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.720
Umm.

a6eedbd7-48a5-4425-b0ab-804499052ce7-0
01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:34.782
It can't live under the sea. It
can't breathe water. So it has a

a6eedbd7-48a5-4425-b0ab-804499052ce7-1
01:44:34.782 --> 01:44:40.574
tank of air on its back and lots
of different tubes coming away

a6eedbd7-48a5-4425-b0ab-804499052ce7-2
01:44:40.574 --> 01:44:46.185
from it. And the tubes, one of
them has the light that is was

a6eedbd7-48a5-4425-b0ab-804499052ce7-3
01:44:46.185 --> 01:44:51.163
shined on the hat. So the
creature has come out of the

a6eedbd7-48a5-4425-b0ab-804499052ce7-4
01:44:51.163 --> 01:44:56.050
water and has picked up the hat
and is looking at it.

1dcadd6b-7ce4-45b0-b235-43fe2f812306-0
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:57.590
Umm.

65ec63f0-0fb9-455d-9b3e-1f81c31bd3e9-0
01:44:59.040 --> 01:44:59.660
And.

8d941af1-56ef-43c6-9c00-9b856c28291b-0
01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.610
It's just hard to say what this
creature is, but it has.

1157990f-5baa-4bd8-84cf-f8815ac35275-0
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:12.317
Not even fins. It has like leaf
fronds for hands, has a sweater

1157990f-5baa-4bd8-84cf-f8815ac35275-1
01:45:12.317 --> 01:45:12.590
on.

9ab1824e-fe87-4f50-bb19-7cefa3c73191-0
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:18.030
And just tubes and tentacles
coming from all over the place.

0426e756-bc03-40e9-9bfd-fd32734e9a3f-0
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.412
Anyway, this creature has the
hat in its hands, and we will

0426e756-bc03-40e9-9bfd-fd32734e9a3f-1
01:45:22.412 --> 01:45:24.620
find out what happens on the
next page.

e793d919-7b17-43ad-9121-55985af31a35-0
01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.090
So.

f331938d-a80b-43f0-8e83-eecf91600627-0
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:37.691
The hat is floating, but it
looks like the creature may be

f331938d-a80b-43f0-8e83-eecf91600627-1
01:45:37.691 --> 01:45:42.352
with it because one of the the
tentacles of light that the

f331938d-a80b-43f0-8e83-eecf91600627-2
01:45:42.352 --> 01:45:43.380
creature had.

5d5184c5-be2e-463d-884f-b92a2b34aa64-0
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.500
Has.

c0aa2265-02cc-4cb6-a5cc-af207666bcc6-0
01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:51.379
Helped him swim towards a boat.
There's a huge ship or two ships

c0aa2265-02cc-4cb6-a5cc-af207666bcc6-1
01:45:51.379 --> 01:45:56.458
that are floating towards the
Hat and they are giving off lots

c0aa2265-02cc-4cb6-a5cc-af207666bcc6-2
01:45:56.458 --> 01:46:01.294
of smoke in the first on the
first page. Just the the whole

c0aa2265-02cc-4cb6-a5cc-af207666bcc6-3
01:46:01.294 --> 01:46:05.970
top page. The whole top of the
page is filled with smoke.

5ec3503a-d0e6-4ff6-95c4-7bc6e54b1632-0
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:10.750
And the ship is headed right
towards the little hat.

0f111f3a-c498-4a79-b296-4876d86d1b7c-0
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:13.160
And on the second page.

031aee6f-8a2c-4c4b-a1aa-6a6ce2c04a19-0
01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:18.168
The birds are back and and
flying along the the bottom part

031aee6f-8a2c-4c4b-a1aa-6a6ce2c04a19-1
01:46:18.168 --> 01:46:19.010
of the boat.

3eeb82d9-513d-4f65-8585-22b5e9c62d00-0
01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:20.680
But.

00056ea6-18fb-4b4e-b40f-62fadfa9b52e-0
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.140
Actually, maybe the.

5aebf174-28b3-48a5-8c70-39f04142cca8-0
01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.200


23844054-1eea-4da8-85fa-ccfce95eff01-0
01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.023
No, what I think is the first
page is the boat and then the

23844054-1eea-4da8-85fa-ccfce95eff01-1
01:46:32.023 --> 01:46:34.050
second page is the boat has.

381e5c95-06fc-40d9-beed-1062d4f83e4b-0
01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:40.675
Moved, has seen the hat and has.
We're now on the other side of

381e5c95-06fc-40d9-beed-1062d4f83e4b-1
01:46:40.675 --> 01:46:45.696
the boat. You can see the side
the anchor is moored up and

381e5c95-06fc-40d9-beed-1062d4f83e4b-2
01:46:45.696 --> 01:46:50.631
where it belongs in the top of
the ship. And the water is

381e5c95-06fc-40d9-beed-1062d4f83e4b-3
01:46:50.631 --> 01:46:55.311
coming out of holes on the
bottom of the ship. And the

381e5c95-06fc-40d9-beed-1062d4f83e4b-4
01:46:55.311 --> 01:47:00.417
birds are flying where the
water's coming out. And the ship

381e5c95-06fc-40d9-beed-1062d4f83e4b-5
01:47:00.417 --> 01:47:03.140
is very tall and it has lots of.

4a53c1a8-8574-42af-8510-b9d451a2b22a-0
01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.847
Rooms in it. You can see little
windows at the top where there

4a53c1a8-8574-42af-8510-b9d451a2b22a-1
01:47:07.847 --> 01:47:11.600
may be people or something
living up there. Turn the page.

25b95e85-8198-4501-9d2a-2221fb6ab00f-0
01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.320
So.

4eb8fb65-53ff-4b82-b832-3e43db459683-0
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.030
I.

31eb381d-ddb5-4fcf-9a26-51b15e91f7b5-0
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:27.998
I can't really tell on the first
page here, but the hat is moving

31eb381d-ddb5-4fcf-9a26-51b15e91f7b5-1
01:47:27.998 --> 01:47:29.350
along. It's floating.

07cd7b67-3674-43ff-838c-63f83f118563-0
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.740
{Oh gosh.

fa407c10-db92-44ca-ae94-be038cb0c80b-0
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:32.830
You know what?

eadc5461-1f17-405f-8821-4481188ba1b5-0
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:36.545
Megan, my batteries going to die
on me. Do you have a minute

eadc5461-1f17-405f-8821-4481188ba1b5-1
01:47:36.545 --> 01:47:38.290
where I can run and get my
battery?

18fa3c00-043f-46e3-9c81-d98dadf24024-0
01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.960
OK. Sorry, one SEC.

dd9a3129-7408-4830-90bd-f28c1817f4f7-0
01:47:43.400 --> 01:48:02.000


83303c4a-5a61-4085-a0b5-780002a68a6d-0
01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:22.000


3a8ae863-88fe-4d9d-981c-ce78537aec64-0
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:23.180


cc1a334d-2ba9-4fc6-b925-e92630d0f155-0
01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:47.800
OK.}

5e2b543e-1bee-479a-b6b0-a4095510a05c-0
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:49.930
So.

9f97c949-44d8-48c2-afef-ceb3d6cdbf44-0
01:48:50.710 --> 01:48:52.400
I can't really tell.

77881973-9bd0-48f9-8310-7306af1466de-0
01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.850
On this first page.

9abe228a-0eb1-4fe3-9ed5-094b1bdf78ee-0
01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:59.640
If it's dark at night, or if
it's just the smoke.

9703d6b8-7b65-446c-b592-6fe4f1de3a47-0
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:05.989
Um, that's polluting the air.
But the picture is very dark

9703d6b8-7b65-446c-b592-6fe4f1de3a47-1
01:49:05.989 --> 01:49:11.925
with lots of smoke, and it seems
like the smoke is killing the

9703d6b8-7b65-446c-b592-6fe4f1de3a47-2
01:49:11.925 --> 01:49:17.672
birds. So the birds are the
beautiful birds that were flying

9703d6b8-7b65-446c-b592-6fe4f1de3a47-3
01:49:17.672 --> 01:49:23.043
all around the sea are now
falling from the air into the

9703d6b8-7b65-446c-b592-6fe4f1de3a47-4
01:49:23.043 --> 01:49:23.420
sea.

1102c24e-55ca-4a53-be90-0b9c8f16b145-0
01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:30.065
Looks like they are dying or
dead, and as the hat is

1102c24e-55ca-4a53-be90-0b9c8f16b145-1
01:49:30.065 --> 01:49:34.570
floating, one of the birds lands
on the hat.

59bd735f-1615-493f-a830-91ff40bece79-0
01:49:37.130 --> 01:49:41.415
On the first page, and then as
we get to the second page, we

59bd735f-1615-493f-a830-91ff40bece79-1
01:49:41.415 --> 01:49:42.610
see that there's.

db3e0c88-ba67-4cd4-a6dd-591a83ff6efd-0
01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:48.699
What looks to be like an oil rig
in the middle of the ocean and

db3e0c88-ba67-4cd4-a6dd-591a83ff6efd-1
01:49:48.699 --> 01:49:49.790
it's spewing.

c3b830bc-fa18-44b5-94d1-9cf4b95228a2-0
01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:56.054
Tons and tons of pollution, just
terrible smoke. And this smoke

c3b830bc-fa18-44b5-94d1-9cf4b95228a2-1
01:49:56.054 --> 01:50:01.454
is killing the birds. They have
no air to breathe and they're

c3b830bc-fa18-44b5-94d1-9cf4b95228a2-2
01:50:01.454 --> 01:50:06.679
also killing the fish. It looks
like they're fish, fishing.

c3b830bc-fa18-44b5-94d1-9cf4b95228a2-3
01:50:06.679 --> 01:50:12.253
There's a big whale hanging from
a crane off of this rig in the

c3b830bc-fa18-44b5-94d1-9cf4b95228a2-4
01:50:12.253 --> 01:50:14.169
middle of the sea and.

276d790a-589b-458b-8d9b-264dd587b390-0
01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:17.800
Yeah, so.

54913db1-448c-4eb9-8384-9fe0f36209b9-0
01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:23.160
It looks like there might even
be some fish in the water. I

54913db1-448c-4eb9-8384-9fe0f36209b9-1
01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:27.030
don't know if they're dead, they
may be dead as also.

8a01a76f-ad1a-4d76-a6cb-e2d3969d8b40-0
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:30.460
Underneath the.

5ac1d210-e4e3-447f-af31-2581c9807d6f-0
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:32.450
Terrible.

6442e33b-1899-4609-a84a-76b61d889602-0
01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:38.671
Rig in the middle of the sea
that's spewing smoke, lots of

6442e33b-1899-4609-a84a-76b61d889602-1
01:50:38.671 --> 01:50:39.080
deaths.

b536d19a-f5c2-4d09-9ac1-9fd499cdd051-0
01:50:40.190 --> 01:50:40.890
Turn the page.

90e25e22-6e81-42f7-a3dc-0f85216d73af-0
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:50.390
So this.

7985a14a-3d60-4644-937a-45803dde88e0-0
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:58.888
On this first page, it seems to
be a death star in the middle of

7985a14a-3d60-4644-937a-45803dde88e0-1
01:50:58.888 --> 01:51:00.030
the ocean.

01660d1d-c96f-446a-a643-6ac8bb64c6ac-0
01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.540
That there are creatures on
board that have guns and as the.

06afde8b-d94e-4cce-8f3b-990ffa04719b-0
01:51:07.230 --> 01:51:07.690
Hat.

559b9ddf-b535-44f3-9202-5fdd26351c6d-0
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:10.020
Is passing by.

b11734aa-2d8c-436b-93b5-7cf8ef4789cb-0
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:15.868
They shoot it and one of them
shoots a hole in the hat, and

b11734aa-2d8c-436b-93b5-7cf8ef4789cb-1
01:51:15.868 --> 01:51:20.747
they're also shooting the fish
and they're shooting the the

b11734aa-2d8c-436b-93b5-7cf8ef4789cb-2
01:51:20.747 --> 01:51:25.219
creature that was under the
water that helped the hat.

e0e5e541-6f03-4e82-9fec-268e3703a654-0
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:31.100
And it's just bringing death and
destruction.

304e0e52-9ebc-476b-9b83-9096fd71905a-0
01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:37.700
So it looks as though though on
the next page that the.

30f61599-30a0-4898-ab7e-083a2d396b23-0
01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.710
The creature, The person.

c7f56b81-301e-47ef-9765-d29e46549a58-0
01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.692
I guess he was trying to escape.
Maybe it was someone who was

c7f56b81-301e-47ef-9765-d29e46549a58-1
01:51:48.692 --> 01:51:50.130
trying to escape this.

21eb923a-8f41-40ec-a206-e4569c218700-0
01:51:51.810 --> 01:51:52.430
Rig.

bd028e10-320e-484e-9585-e39fa565fc88-0
01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:56.060
Anyway, he on the next page.

eafa51df-2bb7-4a6f-ab53-201da54b0b14-0
01:51:58.130 --> 01:51:58.910
The hat

6fdc1689-8151-43ba-a895-2f5cc298c732-0
01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:04.490
Has a life preserver in it and
is floating along, and it looks

6fdc1689-8151-43ba-a895-2f5cc298c732-1
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:08.489
like he's going to try to save
the person who is trying to

6fdc1689-8151-43ba-a895-2f5cc298c732-2
01:52:08.489 --> 01:52:10.320
escape this terrible death.

07cecef3-0c9d-4d93-8fcf-4a82f0f71147-0
01:52:13.230 --> 01:52:15.630
Death platform in the middle of
the ocean.

74b0e2f4-f838-4455-8363-c66b80523a76-0
01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:18.060
And there's also a little.

2c7b76ec-7494-4ad8-93be-33be6f8a3309-0
01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:22.365
I can't tell if it's a creature
or if that's just the fuel tank

2c7b76ec-7494-4ad8-93be-33be6f8a3309-1
01:52:22.365 --> 01:52:22.970
of the ship.

44b0d8ec-2a90-418b-9054-3d706ecc5e2c-0
01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:24.770
Next page.

2b6efb8a-b396-4168-92ff-e2805f23a2db-0
01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:31.270
Yes, so the hat, even though it
has a hole in it.

7c8eb6c8-2a82-46d5-a3e0-ea122bacb316-0
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:37.040
On the first page throws the
life preserver to the the the

7c8eb6c8-2a82-46d5-a3e0-ea122bacb316-1
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:41.320
being that was trying to escape
the oil platform.

67b16513-40c9-4562-b333-d1596a865cd0-0
01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:45.645
And it was killing everything.
And they float, they begin

67b16513-40c9-4562-b333-d1596a865cd0-1
01:52:45.645 --> 01:52:49.230
floating and there's a big wave,
so it carries them away.

514881d2-9ad2-4c86-8305-1a7641fddd35-0
01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.180
To.

c3939856-ee89-4147-be01-a4e581369366-0
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:54.370
Back to.

36f98dca-6661-4768-beca-ecf1fbbd59db-0
01:52:57.610 --> 01:52:59.000
The original.

8abccaac-1f68-492a-a616-9d65e003fcba-0
01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:04.868
Creature that was helping to to
make the hat, the creature that

8abccaac-1f68-492a-a616-9d65e003fcba-1
01:53:04.868 --> 01:53:08.937
was in the Black Cape and the
black suit with the white horn

8abccaac-1f68-492a-a616-9d65e003fcba-2
01:53:08.937 --> 01:53:13.006
out of his head and the white
horn coming at the back of his

8abccaac-1f68-492a-a616-9d65e003fcba-3
01:53:13.006 --> 01:53:13.340
head.

dcd0641a-7194-4b00-b916-7528033d2fb5-0
01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:14.770
Umm.

7a8e638e-a77d-45f8-8cbf-b3418187b699-0
01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:21.177
He's on a on a boat that's made
of a seashell and he has these

7a8e638e-a77d-45f8-8cbf-b3418187b699-1
01:53:21.177 --> 01:53:23.520
strange looking horses and.

c41eb9eb-76d9-4c6e-b5dd-5fbfbcd720cf-0
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:27.140
Deer, antelope, and a jester.

dc8d99f5-d1c1-477b-932a-0a5deaa4f728-0
01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:29.450
And little.

607193cf-0e91-42db-bacb-56dad8679eb7-0
01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.685
White little creatures. And they
have. They're attached to a

607193cf-0e91-42db-bacb-56dad8679eb7-1
01:53:35.685 --> 01:53:41.302
kite, and the hat is floating
towards this this strange group

607193cf-0e91-42db-bacb-56dad8679eb7-2
01:53:41.302 --> 01:53:42.480
of creatures.

299920f9-4806-4c1a-8e99-a2d718738a5c-0
01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:47.220
And there's even a cat standing
up in the mast.

b31b9b82-931b-47f8-8d4e-56b5014e8f91-0
01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:48.920
And.

41dbf7f7-9b17-437b-8b0c-c6f432b54d9e-0
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:50.590
Next page.

f5ecd2ca-ef2e-4108-8e08-10c80e6155bb-0
01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:57.630
But as they try to reach.

27a8da9b-c7a7-4194-9077-0cc6c23a5ef3-0
01:53:58.310 --> 01:54:03.430
The as as the Hat tries to reach
the.

36e539a5-428b-4c63-9b49-7343673b6f39-0
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.819
The the the seashell boat with
all the creatures on it, a huge

36e539a5-428b-4c63-9b49-7343673b6f39-1
01:54:10.819 --> 01:54:15.639
wave comes along and engulfs the
hat and picks it up, and it's

36e539a5-428b-4c63-9b49-7343673b6f39-2
01:54:15.639 --> 01:54:20.689
one that curls so as if a surfer
could go through the curl of it.

36e539a5-428b-4c63-9b49-7343673b6f39-3
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:25.126
When it's, you know when the
wave is breaking, the hat is

36e539a5-428b-4c63-9b49-7343673b6f39-4
01:54:25.126 --> 01:54:29.793
stuck in that and it's it's
flying, it's floating up towards

36e539a5-428b-4c63-9b49-7343673b6f39-5
01:54:29.793 --> 01:54:34.460
the top of the wave, looking as
if it's going to be crushed.

c6f511f2-cbe1-4cf9-9284-c446eb8979be-0
01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.710
And on the next page as the.

760800e3-1e3c-4e49-8dcb-c94680837965-0
01:54:38.890 --> 01:54:40.670
As the hat is floating.

f99883bb-518d-4985-b738-6f0cd2b64a87-0
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:44.380
To its destruction, the.

5d4a9339-c3fd-46e9-8519-27bf07ac44e2-0
01:54:45.150 --> 01:54:46.930
Umm, its.

dfb88aad-2dc0-4432-884c-51e9a415f367-0
01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:53.214
Maker, the the creature with the
Black Cape and the horns coming

dfb88aad-2dc0-4432-884c-51e9a415f367-1
01:54:53.214 --> 01:54:58.885
out of his head, who's riding in
the seashell with the horse, the

dfb88aad-2dc0-4432-884c-51e9a415f367-2
01:54:58.885 --> 01:55:04.299
crazy horses, and the the man
that he saved, the creature that

dfb88aad-2dc0-4432-884c-51e9a415f367-3
01:55:04.299 --> 01:55:07.649
he saved, that the hat saved
with the.

28b6d2c0-0a85-4375-9333-8dce99e6643e-0
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:09.810
Life preserver.

ec6bb26e-ffcd-4b8b-a2bb-185bf58d8db3-0
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:15.100
The man, the the creature that
originally.

7332ddc3-6313-4aa3-9b89-c4ffcba73fc9-0
01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:21.498
Folded the hat, has a paper
airplane in his hand, and it

7332ddc3-6313-4aa3-9b89-c4ffcba73fc9-1
01:55:21.498 --> 01:55:26.787
looks as if he's going to throw
the paper airplane to the hat to

7332ddc3-6313-4aa3-9b89-c4ffcba73fc9-2
01:55:26.787 --> 01:55:29.880
try to save the hat from
destruction.

f77a540f-7724-48f5-9f21-71d110fead3f-0
01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.530
The next page.

192f0646-f45b-4d17-8ac9-2ff15a206ea7-0
01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:38.140
Hmm.

b155784b-c7c5-48df-ae12-3f6cebe8a0df-0
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:43.650
So the picture.

b971a70c-a9fd-4eb7-b987-5b6829b1230b-0
01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:49.410
What happens is I don't know
what happened to the.

42a81bd8-e140-425a-a780-ef4aa55dff65-0
01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:55.060
The boat with the seashell and
all the creatures in it.

fef3c5f0-3e9e-4cf8-b356-c74eb768e078-0
01:55:55.810 --> 01:55:59.718
Or anything, except that we see
the hat floating. He still has a

fef3c5f0-3e9e-4cf8-b356-c74eb768e078-1
01:55:59.718 --> 01:56:00.380
hole in it.

7886f3c8-1b5d-40b0-983d-62c3ba002329-0
01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.240
From being shot.

a03f0d41-438b-43ed-af2f-c7b59e42467e-0
01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:06.860
But there's a bolt of lightning
that has come down to the sea.

91fcd2f0-45da-4e9b-a1a0-e5ac1ed954e1-0
01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:13.229
surrounded by all the smoke, and
it's a light that lights up,

91fcd2f0-45da-4e9b-a1a0-e5ac1ed954e1-1
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:18.323
separating the smoke and the
sea, and on the next page,

91fcd2f0-45da-4e9b-a1a0-e5ac1ed954e1-2
01:56:18.323 --> 01:56:20.780
through the dark comes the.

cc58b074-3918-4f88-9fc1-2ea016825975-0
01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:22.810
Umm.

9b644771-b13c-41f5-ad4d-dd86ddaf7089-0
01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.850
The paper airplane swooshing
through the air.

ba239d82-e436-4e06-9c00-4cd3f0ed4eea-0
01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:32.860
So I guess the little hat
survived.

df182ba6-8717-4cad-9804-4bf263036a46-0
01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:38.253
The wave and he floats on and
the next scene, the next page is

df182ba6-8717-4cad-9804-4bf263036a46-1
01:56:38.253 --> 01:56:42.623
just the paper airplane flying
through the air over the sea.

df182ba6-8717-4cad-9804-4bf263036a46-2
01:56:42.623 --> 01:56:43.340
Next page.

6249e4b9-fd7b-4271-89e6-f4aa4527f8c9-0
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:52.970
And.

aa6ecdc5-76d1-4736-b665-90561a65a910-0
01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:02.448
As the paper hat floats along,
it comes to an area that looks

aa6ecdc5-76d1-4736-b665-90561a65a910-1
01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:05.880
like Donuts floating on the sea.

17e0a62a-fa7e-4edb-ab29-49dee68d2035-0
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:10.190
And these Donuts are actually.

f6c4ca50-a6f0-414e-a206-7f9d424b18bc-0
01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:18.177
As, so he floats into one of the
donut holes or into the arch,

f6c4ca50-a6f0-414e-a206-7f9d424b18bc-1
01:57:18.177 --> 01:57:23.974
and there are hundreds of them.
But what he finds out in the

f6c4ca50-a6f0-414e-a206-7f9d424b18bc-2
01:57:23.974 --> 01:57:26.540
next picture is that these.

5169b80b-dbc4-4ef8-a04b-f6f6a6f10aa2-0
01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.470
The Donuts were actually sea
creatures or sea serpents.

03e7ad8f-3d24-4f05-87f1-6ad679ef5abf-0
01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:38.211
And they come to life, and one
of them picks him up and looks

03e7ad8f-3d24-4f05-87f1-6ad679ef5abf-1
01:57:38.211 --> 01:57:38.850
at him.

293b77cb-3bcf-4a93-b701-8c374a023219-0
01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:44.645
And he keeps what he keeps
floating. And then he sees

293b77cb-3bcf-4a93-b701-8c374a023219-1
01:57:44.645 --> 01:57:49.634
another set of creatures on the
other side of these these the

293b77cb-3bcf-4a93-b701-8c374a023219-2
01:57:49.634 --> 01:57:50.600
sea serpent.

7a880785-f485-4bcb-9fc8-023ab1cec543-0
01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:56.207
And this creature has a big,
it's like a narwhal. He has a

7a880785-f485-4bcb-9fc8-023ab1cec543-1
01:57:56.207 --> 01:58:00.878
big harpoon coming out of his
head, and his eyes are glowing

7a880785-f485-4bcb-9fc8-023ab1cec543-2
01:58:00.878 --> 01:58:05.779
and he's waiting for the little
hat to come floating out of the

7a880785-f485-4bcb-9fc8-023ab1cec543-3
01:58:05.779 --> 01:58:08.000
sea serpents area. Next page.

8536eb43-c326-46fb-a0d8-e08393f448ca-0
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:17.500
And as the hat floats by the
narwhal creature.

79fb8e64-d7d9-445a-a654-91cf36f27b7a-0
01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.600
Shoots water from his nose into
the hat.

a28ebe7b-72b0-4309-aada-b031c55e877d-0
01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:24.890
And tries to capsize it.

204f22ed-7dc0-4447-99fe-ef1a4d5241d0-0
01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.470
But the hat survives.

9365e52e-bca5-47de-bc70-1de4d6717928-0
01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:32.970
Not much worse for the wear and
continues on his journey.

599ba2d4-b9fc-4746-836e-d4452aa6e9ec-0
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:37.560
To where it looks as if there's
land.

e104991e-3fd2-413b-82f6-a131c5de59ce-0
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:43.560
And a human looking bird
creature.

fb30692e-6a07-4529-8ec2-4c3b099e8f8b-0
01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:45.790
This creature.

d7635411-ca90-482c-a90d-6f070eb05672-0
01:58:46.710 --> 01:58:52.746
That creature is standing on
land with propellers all around

d7635411-ca90-482c-a90d-6f070eb05672-1
01:58:52.746 --> 01:58:57.200
him and old bottles of wine and
old cans of.

220de29d-6144-4255-9642-32fe8aa546ab-0
01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:02.570
pop and just standing there
watching the hat for by.

1dacc2f4-d401-430b-b712-d2c2fc1b694c-0
01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:07.775
And the smoke is starting to
dissipate and there's a bird in

1dacc2f4-d401-430b-b712-d2c2fc1b694c-1
01:59:07.775 --> 01:59:11.964
the air, so it looks like the
bird the the hat is getting away

1dacc2f4-d401-430b-b712-d2c2fc1b694c-2
01:59:11.964 --> 01:59:16.220
and moving away from the death
and destruction of that oil rig.

0cbdbf0e-a750-4d4c-ba01-401c40bd0c82-0
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:17.710
Next page.

a8b840e0-46d5-4136-a31c-b33972c17b82-0
01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:24.290
So

2ab40493-9070-4239-93c0-53069568ef22-0
01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:27.340
The water.

c25099ff-ae33-4715-9d27-2ee26667e140-0
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.900
Of the.

55b4786b-0c54-4d02-8795-472250bb2d2f-0
01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:34.110
The water that the creature
poured into the hat.

649ecdcd-5214-47fd-a183-2864c738aefb-0
01:59:36.230 --> 01:59:41.008
Made it soggy and it started to
sink and it began to sink into a

649ecdcd-5214-47fd-a183-2864c738aefb-1
01:59:41.008 --> 01:59:44.390
world of jellyfish. Beautiful
jellyfish with.

b542e0fd-08ca-4800-b7c4-70627abec310-0
01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:50.690
Beautiful colors and just
floating along and the hat.

27e2122d-bb9e-40ed-bc9e-4265789bf39b-0
01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:53.120
Began to float among them.

d47a747a-1ac3-472c-921a-e330a1fa1766-0
01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.910
Jellyfish with round umbrellas.

5a71a117-2894-49a9-82b0-6cfaaabdd380-0
01:59:57.570 --> 02:00:01.649
And the tentacles floating
downward and that looked like

5a71a117-2894-49a9-82b0-6cfaaabdd380-1
02:00:01.649 --> 02:00:06.230
they have a pretty flower on top
of, a four-leaf flower on top.

720aa1b6-43b8-40c9-be66-4660df529618-0
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:10.290
And the next picture is just.

d713b68b-f013-40ea-981f-d25defa77fb7-0
02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:14.813
Again filled with these
jellyfish just floating in the

d713b68b-f013-40ea-981f-d25defa77fb7-1
02:00:14.813 --> 02:00:18.920
dark sea. They're light colored
and they have these four-leaf

d713b68b-f013-40ea-981f-d25defa77fb7-2
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:19.450
flowers.

865a20e3-bcb1-41cc-b5da-626e2f00928c-0
02:00:20.110 --> 02:00:24.419
Tentacles. But as they're
floating along, a different kind

865a20e3-bcb1-41cc-b5da-626e2f00928c-1
02:00:24.419 --> 02:00:27.560
of jellyfish comes up, and this
one has a.

b83248aa-4220-4fbc-bd7c-b95198ce78e9-0
02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:33.054
A black and white or Gray and
white umbrella shaped, mushroom

b83248aa-4220-4fbc-bd7c-b95198ce78e9-1
02:00:33.054 --> 02:00:37.640
shaped top that's different from
the others with long tentacles.

ca11be1c-288a-4a23-8935-4c324937bf71-0
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:41.940
Flowing from it. Long worm like
tentacles flowing from it.

77ab0a10-08c5-4f3e-8c55-c7456f92faba-0
02:00:42.710 --> 02:00:43.350
Next page.

7428068c-3f32-4633-85a7-258da16fe5a8-0
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:47.870
So the hat

ad2fd5cc-068c-4fb2-b754-0858237b9b7f-0
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:51.040
Makes it through the jellyfish.

de69dce1-0630-4905-af5d-761b60828bad-0
02:00:51.710 --> 02:00:53.860
And is now floating under the
water.

11b1937d-5388-4d58-80d4-4127327a3186-0
02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:55.450
Umm.

11443c02-5818-4cc8-bcfd-4e16db8b43b2-0
02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:02.128
Being carried along at first by
the jellyfish and now he's being

11443c02-5818-4cc8-bcfd-4e16db8b43b2-1
02:01:02.128 --> 02:01:07.278
carried along by a school of
fish with glowing eyes and that

11443c02-5818-4cc8-bcfd-4e16db8b43b2-2
02:01:07.278 --> 02:01:12.513
look like piranhas. The same
shape as a piranha would be kind

11443c02-5818-4cc8-bcfd-4e16db8b43b2-3
02:01:12.513 --> 02:01:16.060
of like an almond shaped eye of
fish and.

9919ff43-15a2-418a-a30c-aadbd9b0c731-0
02:01:18.130 --> 02:01:22.567
Every, we must be deep down
because all the fish have

9919ff43-15a2-418a-a30c-aadbd9b0c731-1
02:01:22.567 --> 02:01:24.540
glowing eyes or no eyes.

34487230-ad45-4775-bbbe-93a0af7fcae5-0
02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:29.750
And on the next page the Hat

d70583d8-8475-4bae-92c4-131102d321a9-0
02:01:30.490 --> 02:01:34.650
Is surrounded by all kinds of
just floating.

c09aeb0a-5b5f-4ffc-bf99-108a85dd0b8a-0
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:36.790
Strange looking.

b6b7b9cb-f8d3-42b7-8220-22f0adde1cdd-0
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:42.510
Jellyfish and lanternfish that
are just floating around.

6a56b5a4-9698-44f6-a54b-af284ee13475-0
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:45.800
As well as him.

00592efb-922e-4248-98aa-2717f8efd3a5-0
02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:51.070
And as he.

67d2863c-118b-4e38-a02d-7bf9d0cea3d6-0
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:56.418
Floats lower and lower, he
settles into the bottom of the

67d2863c-118b-4e38-a02d-7bf9d0cea3d6-1
02:01:56.418 --> 02:02:01.273
sea. And when, when it's when
suddenly my hat has become a he.

67d2863c-118b-4e38-a02d-7bf9d0cea3d6-2
02:02:01.273 --> 02:02:02.660
So when my he hat.

fd7c7878-1fab-4857-94b5-02ae2c263203-0
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:06.330
Gets to the bottom of the sea.

dab19fdf-b982-4d14-8b7f-63de5af2e86e-0
02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:12.756
Little creatures with long legs
and tentacles coming out of

dab19fdf-b982-4d14-8b7f-63de5af2e86e-1
02:02:12.756 --> 02:02:15.470
their heads and arms. Long arms.

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-0
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:21.967
Climb all over the hat. There
are three of them, and they're

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-1
02:02:21.967 --> 02:02:25.715
climbing in the hat to
investigate what it is that has

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-2
02:02:25.715 --> 02:02:29.600
come into their area. And
there's a light that's beaming

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-3
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.689
down onto the hat so we can
actually see what is happening.

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-4
02:02:33.689 --> 02:02:37.710
So we can see these three
creatures as they climb into the

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-5
02:02:37.710 --> 02:02:41.459
hat and feel the hat and
possibly eat the hat. I don't

b78490cf-e9b0-46b6-ab34-26fa5d702257-6
02:02:41.459 --> 02:02:41.799
know.

98c5f600-5623-47bf-8aa0-b47d5643bb32-0
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:49.060
And the next page though shows
that the hat is actually.

4156c948-d3f5-4303-904b-ac0260b2e21d-0
02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.980
Illuminated by a light.

f9f715c7-b0db-4713-919b-63eff3c73abd-0
02:02:55.670 --> 02:02:56.820
And the tip of a.

c327c372-0fa9-4f4e-9f13-79e7ff8a46a2-0
02:02:57.890 --> 02:02:58.860
Submarine.

12b6fc9a-11ed-4aed-88cd-998af661c17c-0
02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:04.330
And the submarine is
investigating all of the.

bba730f7-c264-4a85-a5d9-d91f6cc31146-0
02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:10.540
The fish life at the bottom of
the sea and there's a big.

55066f1b-40c4-4f0c-8255-eb11f77702bd-0
02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:17.193
Serpent with tentacles coming
out of his head looking like a

55066f1b-40c4-4f0c-8255-eb11f77702bd-1
02:03:17.193 --> 02:03:22.776
big snake and lots of little
fish that are swimming around

55066f1b-40c4-4f0c-8255-eb11f77702bd-2
02:03:22.776 --> 02:03:23.250
this.

a393ffc9-c1b4-4312-b0d3-8c8f87dcd79b-0
02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:30.944
Submarine with lights that are
flashing out into the dark dark

a393ffc9-c1b4-4312-b0d3-8c8f87dcd79b-1
02:03:30.944 --> 02:03:31.310
sea.

dfec81e3-8011-4323-8110-e94ca2ae6681-0
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:37.613
And the hat is sitting at the
tip of the submarine where the

dfec81e3-8011-4323-8110-e94ca2ae6681-1
02:03:37.613 --> 02:03:38.360
light is.

5acb3ae2-d3c7-4a85-a67c-16f5971886a9-0
02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:48.280
And now everything is bright
white again.

fa16d241-be0e-427c-8581-1bb5d8bfb690-0
02:03:49.050 --> 02:03:54.392
And the submarine has picked up
the hat and brought it to the

fa16d241-be0e-427c-8581-1bb5d8bfb690-1
02:03:54.392 --> 02:03:59.562
surface and is draining the
water. The hat is at the tip of

fa16d241-be0e-427c-8581-1bb5d8bfb690-2
02:03:59.562 --> 02:04:04.818
the submarine. The submarine is
almost vertical in the water

fa16d241-be0e-427c-8581-1bb5d8bfb690-3
02:04:04.818 --> 02:04:06.800
with its the tip of it.

5d9cc4b0-899e-4bf7-a2a3-02971cfa6e77-0
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.730
At above the water with the hat.

b4692920-ac94-428c-b593-11c27c2c11bd-0
02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:16.916
Emptying itself of the water and
there are still some fish

b4692920-ac94-428c-b593-11c27c2c11bd-1
02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:21.557
underneath the water where the
rest of the submarine, most of

b4692920-ac94-428c-b593-11c27c2c11bd-2
02:04:21.557 --> 02:04:22.830
the submarine is.

bf797257-d246-41c0-a426-194bc4b927f7-0
02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:26.100
But on the next page.

d8c550f2-be8e-489a-9396-ff4ef4470716-0
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:31.000
Uh, another submarine was there
with lots of.

f47e4bd5-ecba-44cf-a347-99742a6be847-0
02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:37.813
Octopus tentacles coming out of
it and birds floating around it

f47e4bd5-ecba-44cf-a347-99742a6be847-1
02:04:37.813 --> 02:04:43.225
and it looks like the original
submarine that that the boat

f47e4bd5-ecba-44cf-a347-99742a6be847-2
02:04:43.225 --> 02:04:48.728
that the hat first saw with the
engine, the propeller in the

f47e4bd5-ecba-44cf-a347-99742a6be847-3
02:04:48.728 --> 02:04:49.269
front.

983236f4-7f4b-40d1-b024-948bb7a8b048-0
02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:50.720
Umm.

117a4c70-7143-4359-9f43-c3240f954313-0
02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:53.120
But anyway, the the.

e35a1e2b-86e4-458a-96e9-26cc79062117-0
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:59.482
The hat just floats by. It
floats past this strange looking

02:04:59.482 --> 02:05:02.290
boat contraption. Octopus boat.

02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:08.710
And let's see what its next
adventure is on the next page.

cfd52b10-45ec-4a0e-b85e-f9d3de991ba5-0
02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:17.609
So after he floated by the two
boats, submarine and the the

cfd52b10-45ec-4a0e-b85e-f9d3de991ba5-1
02:05:17.609 --> 02:05:20.580
Whale boat or the octopus boat.

237b65d7-8f74-4eba-abbc-a3ee319ebe4c-0
02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:26.929
A big wind blew up and picked up
the hat and flew, it started

237b65d7-8f74-4eba-abbc-a3ee319ebe4c-1
02:05:26.929 --> 02:05:32.630
floating in the air and as it
floated it passed by a group of.

4e75ff70-4b59-4f9d-8031-53a3caa6e581-0
02:05:33.970 --> 02:05:34.760
Sea

02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.750
Seals.

710b0ecf-046b-4316-aa7c-1c4a9de8a8b5-0
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:42.688
And with those other things, the
seals who were swimming in the

710b0ecf-046b-4316-aa7c-1c4a9de8a8b5-1
02:05:42.688 --> 02:05:43.990
ocean, they were.

dc21f201-3038-4890-981d-307ce48a6079-0
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:48.309
Dark colored, Gray and black
seals with glowing eyes and

dc21f201-3038-4890-981d-307ce48a6079-1
02:05:48.309 --> 02:05:52.118
there most of them were under
the water, but there were four

dc21f201-3038-4890-981d-307ce48a6079-2
02:05:52.118 --> 02:05:56.239
that were floating vertically in
the water with their heads above

dc21f201-3038-4890-981d-307ce48a6079-3
02:05:56.239 --> 02:05:58.799
the water and they saw the hat
float by.

0fa5ef1b-7f62-4d89-8fc8-c22bcc79f39e-0
02:05:59.450 --> 02:06:01.030
And they watched it for by.

437dc023-8d7e-4219-b70a-b5b038d621e7-0
02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:05.890
Until it passed them and.

1f577955-c9ca-4a1d-9977-5b414f7c2922-0
02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.190
In the next on the next picture.

03a51266-7e2d-49b8-b7da-c37621f4d142-0
02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:15.750
Well, one of those seals was
balancing the hat on its nose.

59cc68a2-3cba-49aa-84c2-db830f789275-0
02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:22.010
And so the hats stayed there for
a minute, but the next picture

59cc68a2-3cba-49aa-84c2-db830f789275-1
02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:23.870
shows underneath the sea.

617f447e-a41a-4acb-8cdd-d92b0861bde2-0
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:30.812
More sea life and more
vegetation. See vegetation and

617f447e-a41a-4acb-8cdd-d92b0861bde2-1
02:06:30.812 --> 02:06:34.720
lots more fish coming back to
life.

c2006b04-44b9-456b-b258-70115fa68945-0
02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:36.500
With.

02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:40.550
Yes, more.

02:06:42.170 --> 02:06:49.620
Jellyfish and tiger fish and sea
Fern and plants and the the.

61fb3320-aab9-414d-b611-67037543b707-0
02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:53.250
The sea, the seal.

3fab9d76-528b-462f-82b1-2e500b3e79ae-0
02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:57.630
Finally, let the hat float by.

5c2f4ef2-2a26-47e5-bd6e-fc40b20173b5-0
02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:01.368
Place the heat on the water and
it's floating again now on top

5c2f4ef2-2a26-47e5-bd6e-fc40b20173b5-1
02:07:01.368 --> 02:07:04.514
of the water, but underneath the
water you see all the beautiful

5c2f4ef2-2a26-47e5-bd6e-fc40b20173b5-2
02:07:04.514 --> 02:07:05.239
sea vegetation.

02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:07.690
Umm.

ba4cff6a-edbc-4493-8a36-acf51cb9df6f-0
02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.770
But then it runs into.

97f6c962-978f-4504-a889-3d039a5d4222-0
02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:17.579
Some seaweed that kind of makes
it tilt towards the bottom of

97f6c962-978f-4504-a889-3d039a5d4222-1
02:07:17.579 --> 02:07:23.070
the, towards the sea again, and
underneath you see a picture of

97f6c962-978f-4504-a889-3d039a5d4222-2
02:07:23.070 --> 02:07:24.100
a sea diver.

6922757c-f0e1-404a-bc74-d9a695c2b002-0
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:27.160
Looks like he's looking for
pearls.

35a97dcf-8146-4bf0-8e3b-c2b82b3d738d-0
02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:35.477
He's taking pearls from the sea
and some strange sea eels are

35a97dcf-8146-4bf0-8e3b-c2b82b3d738d-1
02:07:35.477 --> 02:07:40.975
helping him harvest these
pearls, and the hat just floats

35a97dcf-8146-4bf0-8e3b-c2b82b3d738d-2
02:07:40.975 --> 02:07:41.260
by.

7bdd4471-1d8d-4ac1-b4fa-af84c20452e3-0
02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:43.620


b5e094d9-fca6-4035-af01-6353b24ceb6d-0
02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:54.790
The boat is by another scene of
a buoy, a sea buoy, that's.

85019b30-937e-4f25-8fa6-812f124f4f70-0
02:07:56.060 --> 02:08:00.120
Is there to warn ships that the
the.

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:06.566
The sea is getting shallower and
climbing all over the buoy that

d571c8a7-d086-4a03-8865-6b9ce88713d1-1
02:08:06.566 --> 02:08:07.960
has a light on top.

a5f182b5-5209-40eb-8e1d-0f3a335c4c5d-0
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:15.719
Are more sea creatures that have
legs and arms and have starfish

a5f182b5-5209-40eb-8e1d-0f3a335c4c5d-1
02:08:15.719 --> 02:08:21.719
heads and glowing eyes. And then
the the the the sea creature

a5f182b5-5209-40eb-8e1d-0f3a335c4c5d-2
02:08:21.719 --> 02:08:22.590
with the.

Underwater.

02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:28.280
Oxygen mask.

c788ee63-4b44-4221-9caf-00b50d15855a-0
02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.712
That was harvesting the pearls
is floating along the top of the

c788ee63-4b44-4221-9caf-00b50d15855a-1
02:08:34.712 --> 02:08:36.540
water near the sea buoy.

7a49beaf-ec78-4ecf-a556-402026104962-0
02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:40.190
Riding on his.

d2255058-8f9c-48e3-99b4-e2bc86efff8b-0
02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:44.900
Sea creature and the hat just
floats past.

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-0
02:08:45.810 --> 02:08:50.216
And it floats passed on the next
page, the lighthouse, where it

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-1
02:08:50.216 --> 02:08:54.415
warns the ships that are in the
backgrounds. There are three

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-2
02:08:54.415 --> 02:08:58.339
ships in the background. It
warns them of the of shallow

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-3
02:08:58.339 --> 02:09:02.883
grounds, but the the hat doesn't
have to worry about that because

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-4
02:09:02.883 --> 02:09:07.289
he's so light and he just floats
by, the boats and the hat. And

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-5
02:09:07.289 --> 02:09:11.557
there's a lot of smoke in the
background, though, because the

28a59121-d275-419b-a918-ac26b625608d-6
02:09:11.557 --> 02:09:13.210
boats are spewing smoke.

5dda6673-7e95-47da-8366-1e893522fd2b-0
02:09:15.710 --> 02:09:16.180
And the.

9888fd19-829d-4f08-90af-9961e0207c07-0
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:18.840
The hat

4114910c-d9ed-427a-8825-251106d38005-0
02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.250
Continues the float by.

86eafbee-9d34-4410-9965-4152c8c99d32-0
02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.950
A beautiful pier.

bbb7525f-b30a-4719-a226-6aabc4bfa606-0
02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:32.650
Where

bdfc78d0-5852-447a-8f84-6f361764a6d6-0
02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:37.060
Looks like people may entertain
themselves.

10437377-82f7-4d4c-b8a2-265eb3e35063-0
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.860
It's up. It's on stilts and.

e75b5146-c82a-46ac-9ef1-1439e7de8b27-0
02:09:43.110 --> 02:09:44.780
Beautiful iron work.

befcd868-c99e-42bf-b371-6f433aa771e7-0
02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:52.868
And up on top of it is a is a
hall where people would walk and

befcd868-c99e-42bf-b371-6f433aa771e7-1
02:09:52.868 --> 02:09:59.171
maybe enjoy a concert. And on
top of this hall is a flag or

befcd868-c99e-42bf-b371-6f433aa771e7-2
02:09:59.171 --> 02:10:05.160
flags flying and in the
background there's a a big ship.

09288696-c6b7-4aa9-8030-f49376ff9943-0
02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.320
And underneath the water that
the the hat.

2b82154f-1ee1-46c9-bce4-cdfc3f6135e3-0
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:15.390
boat is is floating on are more
fish and more sea life and more

2b82154f-1ee1-46c9-bce4-cdfc3f6135e3-1
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:18.550
sea farms and as it floats past
this.

80e90874-fcda-42e2-acb7-df35853db460-0
02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:21.830
This sea

47a03491-b081-453f-9f5b-47de9c0c0005-0
02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:23.690
Pier.

7165c8dc-a12d-429a-94fd-9c66881e077e-0
02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:25.040
Umm.

211708b4-367c-4a96-9083-ff1360d93ab9-0
02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:35.442
We see in in the distance
towards the shore. It's it that

211708b4-367c-4a96-9083-ff1360d93ab9-1
02:10:35.442 --> 02:10:35.800
this.

38cc2879-a3ee-44e4-b7b4-c7a9954b0b96-0
02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:38.500
Gathering place.

a5f3d756-4bd4-4ac8-a2f5-f35353c9d08b-0
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:42.600
Is way, is a long.

c0512e67-3b38-44fb-9975-a6bf8e812465-0
02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:45.870
Bridge to the shore.

f05d0a6a-4346-4991-a771-1ea2cd8b0cb2-0
02:10:47.130 --> 02:10:51.460
But there's nowhere for the
boats to get past it.

80e6d7a5-ad53-44bf-8c14-4a9692bd9c95-0
02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.960
They have to. They're stuck.

886e9451-db8e-46b4-9708-5c340ab9f2d8-0
02:10:56.110 --> 02:10:58.040
On one side of it. So they must.

26b7d0b9-2c5c-4045-8458-5b79eee2d913-0
02:10:58.770 --> 02:11:05.279
Float out towards where the hat
is and float around the the end

26b7d0b9-2c5c-4045-8458-5b79eee2d913-1
02:11:05.279 --> 02:11:11.890
of the pier or else they cannot
get out to sea. And on the right

26b7d0b9-2c5c-4045-8458-5b79eee2d913-2
02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:18.502
side of the page there's a large
ship that has many, many sails.

26b7d0b9-2c5c-4045-8458-5b79eee2d913-3
02:11:18.502 --> 02:11:20.740
It's a very tall ship.

369ab149-4649-404a-a7f4-d1f052cf99c3-0
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:24.996
And then there's a steamship,
and all these different boats

369ab149-4649-404a-a7f4-d1f052cf99c3-1
02:11:24.996 --> 02:11:28.230
are floating on the water as the
little hat floats by.

93f803f1-2697-4d9a-8475-9cac67b2306b-0
02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:33.020
And that big.

17bf9d3a-606b-451f-ab4d-ea2112726102-0
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:34.380
Ship.

c1d7526c-3b56-4692-ac25-e04cb5c6833a-0
02:11:37.190 --> 02:11:38.480
Doesn't see the hat.

4fede5fc-58c8-4ef0-bd96-7f2ffad6a3b7-0
02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:42.100
And so the hat gets caught up in
the wave.

9546295d-7e0b-4094-8090-f0c06f6e447e-0
02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:44.140
Of it, uh

02:11:45.150 --> 02:11:46.800
Up the back of it and it.

fc97ec81-ba79-4c46-9149-21c13f684179-0
02:11:48.330 --> 02:11:54.071
Kind of goes over a wave and the
wave takes it towards the city

fc97ec81-ba79-4c46-9149-21c13f684179-1
02:11:54.071 --> 02:11:57.480
that that the ships were coming
from.

3ab1fcff-72cb-4f89-ae8e-dd7099ef33b9-0
02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:03.608
And also at the base of this big
ship is a tiny ship, looks more

3ab1fcff-72cb-4f89-ae8e-dd7099ef33b9-1
02:12:03.608 --> 02:12:08.840
like a tugboat, but attached to
the tugboat is a sailboat and.

293fc9d3-b3f8-4122-89eb-2bf01af39ae3-0
02:12:10.570 --> 02:12:16.506
A fan that seems to be blowing
the ship forward and also in

293fc9d3-b3f8-4122-89eb-2bf01af39ae3-1
02:12:16.506 --> 02:12:22.838
this scene of the ocean are some
more birds and fish underneath

293fc9d3-b3f8-4122-89eb-2bf01af39ae3-2
02:12:22.838 --> 02:12:24.520
the big ship and.

41897502-098d-410e-b682-a642fedf7494-0
02:12:25.450 --> 02:12:26.480
A submarine.

a4b5ef47-b20c-4c08-b233-45ea31b2922b-0
02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:31.490
And in the distance is the city
with lots of smoke and.

655dfb8b-038c-452d-b416-5d532518669a-0
02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:34.290
Big buildings.

d72f0f91-8e18-4374-a453-aca1ae86b092-0
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.740
Turn the page.

61865a44-c5f3-47d7-bd95-139fc7e83c5b-0
02:12:43.730 --> 02:12:46.390
And on the first page we see.

8e7e6b34-7c43-4742-8047-effa1e25248b-0
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:49.890
The whale creature.

c1a3cd00-2f8a-4082-8380-ed9571853e85-0
02:12:50.590 --> 02:12:55.333
From many pages ago that was
under the sea that we thought

c1a3cd00-2f8a-4082-8380-ed9571853e85-1
02:12:55.333 --> 02:12:56.620
was just a rock.

84edcf44-c0c8-4453-b321-aa56295c0d6f-0
02:12:57.970 --> 02:13:04.755
He has come to the port where
the boats are and the people are

84edcf44-c0c8-4453-b321-aa56295c0d6f-1
02:13:04.755 --> 02:13:10.140
and the it's we see this big
whale creature with.

746bca4a-4da2-4d02-a0f4-0cc54fef6def-0
02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:15.460
Washing himself off with water
tank of water on his back.

33ae4386-1ebd-4d7a-a783-2ceaeb27d47d-0
02:13:16.130 --> 02:13:22.266
And he is pulling up to the pier
where the big ships are are

33ae4386-1ebd-4d7a-a783-2ceaeb27d47d-1
02:13:22.266 --> 02:13:27.900
docked and there's a buoy there
and some men in a boat.

42fb2da2-d128-4831-92da-e1b3501189b7-0
02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:33.110
And it looks like this whale is
getting ready to go onto land.

b535590b-577f-484b-b146-e84730e87af5-0
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:34.480
Umm.

89f878d9-9184-4d77-95bc-a6ac6ca7afdd-0
02:13:35.850 --> 02:13:39.980
But the in the next page, the
hat's just floating by, he

89f878d9-9184-4d77-95bc-a6ac6ca7afdd-1
02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:44.617
floats by the pier where all the
people are standing, where the

89f878d9-9184-4d77-95bc-a6ac6ca7afdd-2
02:13:44.617 --> 02:13:49.109
big ships have arrived. A couple
of, some seagulls are flying

89f878d9-9184-4d77-95bc-a6ac6ca7afdd-3
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:53.240
around and everybody's waiting
to welcome the big ships.

29d39cbc-6aa4-4747-9e5e-f110a65dff14-0
02:13:54.170 --> 02:13:55.930
But the hat just floats by.

cf50a439-e553-4797-a896-2ac8d4d3e9e3-0
02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:03.284
And he's floating by this busy,
busy port where there are

cf50a439-e553-4797-a896-2ac8d4d3e9e3-1
02:14:03.284 --> 02:14:09.682
cranes, two or three cranes
coming off of this, the roofs of

cf50a439-e553-4797-a896-2ac8d4d3e9e3-2
02:14:09.682 --> 02:14:12.410
that unload the ships and.

e2d3ead9-7527-4f1e-8d1d-c6817e2829f1-0
02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:20.809
Fishing ships that are in the
harbor and it's very Gray. It

e2d3ead9-7527-4f1e-8d1d-c6817e2829f1-1
02:14:20.809 --> 02:14:26.479
looks like there's a lot of
pollution here and the, but the

e2d3ead9-7527-4f1e-8d1d-c6817e2829f1-2
02:14:26.479 --> 02:14:31.110
hat just floats by. In the next
scene there's a.

e41f6d59-77da-4ab8-90a7-1ea431fea907-0
02:14:31.650 --> 02:14:32.650


02e24113-f839-4956-a156-9d195436d661-0
02:14:35.070 --> 02:14:40.863
Picture of a crane that's
unloading what looked to be like

02e24113-f839-4956-a156-9d195436d661-1
02:14:40.863 --> 02:14:41.060
a.

f35f1ff0-c0ee-4898-98f1-a6b247970914-0
02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.420
A submarine that had been
floating under the water.

93013c29-c541-48a8-888d-f1cace05cec2-0
02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.934
That kind of looks it has, it
looks more like a a seahorse

93013c29-c541-48a8-888d-f1cace05cec2-1
02:14:53.934 --> 02:14:54.370
tail.

56b148e0-e9d2-4bb8-b29f-82bd4f09feca-0
02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:59.490
And that's who is being unloaded
from the water.

977b18d9-8f9c-4819-996e-294590a01b84-0
02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:05.061
And in this scene, it's it's
next to a building that has a

977b18d9-8f9c-4819-996e-294590a01b84-1
02:15:05.061 --> 02:15:05.650
door that.

4669fcea-76d6-45de-999d-22d2a1fc5fb6-0
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:10.977
In which someone can come down
and walk down steps and go into

4669fcea-76d6-45de-999d-22d2a1fc5fb6-1
02:15:10.977 --> 02:15:12.180
the sea. Next page.

a5477a4e-dabf-4120-9c1e-7dba0c8e103d-0
02:15:19.450 --> 02:15:22.840
And the hat stops because he
finds a friendly person who is.

f0720c56-7153-408e-a727-bc369e2fe2c5-0
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:28.700
Willing to give him directions.
So he stops for directions and

f0720c56-7153-408e-a727-bc369e2fe2c5-1
02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:30.520
then he notices also that.

1e48abac-5e82-4b05-8fef-1dc8443cd1b8-0
02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:37.223
The fishing boat has caught one
of the creatures who he passed

1e48abac-5e82-4b05-8fef-1dc8443cd1b8-1
02:15:37.223 --> 02:15:43.130
by. The narwhal that he met out
at sea is stuck in the net and.

d1f3cfb5-c00b-4d16-8e96-cf509ffa971f-0
02:15:44.130 --> 02:15:47.300
He asks if they'll let him go.

bf41f238-41a1-45d2-8ae8-1a8d889005dd-0
02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:53.300
The Narwhal seems very sad.

9fcaaeba-b5f7-4cf7-bac6-2ea241342607-0
02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:54.950
Umm.

4d3c9dae-afb3-4239-8ba0-6cdd5668fe2d-0
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:57.090
And so.

68c09dbd-169d-41ff-b2e7-e0680d947e92-0
02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:04.306
It doesn't show what actually
happens to the creature, but the

68c09dbd-169d-41ff-b2e7-e0680d947e92-1
02:16:04.306 --> 02:16:04.570
hat.

f2fecf9b-2b72-4f71-8917-57a54f79c8bd-0
02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:10.530
Continues to float on by and
sees more birds and.

b8e4cd6e-564c-497b-a3e3-f2fadd6bbef7-0
02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:13.900
More ships and.

03c23b95-5bd8-461d-a1b5-497e28184f83-0
02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.163
One of the ships that looks like
it has a big house on it is

03c23b95-5bd8-461d-a1b5-497e28184f83-1
02:16:19.163 --> 02:16:20.810
called the exploratio.

1dcc8449-1bbc-4a2c-b713-fb90a2098b6e-0
02:16:22.190 --> 02:16:22.840
Umm.

3bee228f-811d-4c99-9501-27f49054f96f-0
02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:30.651
And something else is called the
Pheno or something. I can't read

3bee228f-811d-4c99-9501-27f49054f96f-1
02:16:30.651 --> 02:16:35.024
it, but anyway. So the little
hat pulls up to or is either

3bee228f-811d-4c99-9501-27f49054f96f-2
02:16:35.024 --> 02:16:39.470
floating by or pulling up to a
man that's standing on steps

3bee228f-811d-4c99-9501-27f49054f96f-3
02:16:39.470 --> 02:16:42.880
leading from this city area or
this big boat.

31e98874-1618-4afd-86a2-7537b8dc4f66-0
02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:44.310
Next page.

f5ef13e9-f371-40aa-b762-4d92d354e13f-0
02:16:52.650 --> 02:16:56.550
And then, after talking with the
man, the little.

c62de6a9-5116-4426-877d-08046875bb5b-0
02:16:57.930 --> 02:17:02.720
Hat boat floats on down the
river that goes through.

e3a785ec-e421-429f-9c11-82927dd90aa4-0
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:07.960
From the port, the river
continues on through the city.

408c9479-1917-462b-b80e-49e14b02d31c-0
02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:14.155
And it's actually quite a pretty
city, with houses on each side

408c9479-1917-462b-b80e-49e14b02d31c-1
02:17:14.155 --> 02:17:19.136
of the riverbanks and the a
walkway where people can walk

408c9479-1917-462b-b80e-49e14b02d31c-2
02:17:19.136 --> 02:17:20.510
along the river.

ec8d58f2-18ec-45f6-85ec-f82d65a0f026-0
02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:23.610
And crossing the seas are.

3949422a-0e99-49f5-8551-2d3a2d0d8bbe-0
02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:27.570
Bridges where people can live.

9c1ad122-72d9-48f4-b8a0-9dedf12f3f42-0
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:30.650
um or walk across.

1f3cb723-e492-47cc-b13e-07d671fda334-0
02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:35.570
And the city is full of lights
and.

a03cf118-2299-4ad8-afc8-35e37965de97-0
02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:42.432
Although there doesn't show many
people there, there are signs

a03cf118-2299-4ad8-afc8-35e37965de97-1
02:17:42.432 --> 02:17:44.270
that people live there.

e1c303bb-4214-4d70-b766-3b4b9d97baf5-0
02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:51.021
There are also pigeons sitting
on the roofs watching over the

e1c303bb-4214-4d70-b766-3b4b9d97baf5-1
02:17:51.021 --> 02:17:53.240
city, and there's a strange.

Winged.

02:17:58.690 --> 02:18:03.900
Bird creature. The one that was
sitting on the island with the

9e6f8ef4-5de0-40a4-b69c-289437d17458-1
02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:09.028
propellers and the old glass
bottles and the old tin cans. He

9e6f8ef4-5de0-40a4-b69c-289437d17458-2
02:18:09.028 --> 02:18:13.825
is sitting or walking off a
roof, one of the roofs of the

9e6f8ef4-5de0-40a4-b69c-289437d17458-3
02:18:13.825 --> 02:18:17.630
houses in the city with the
little hat below.

aa3044be-7b9a-4d57-a71b-ea8fc3de6983-0
02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:22.340
The hat as it floats down the
river is being followed by a

aa3044be-7b9a-4d57-a71b-ea8fc3de6983-1
02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:23.130
little boat.

02:18:30.930 --> 02:18:34.220
And as the boat as the hat is
floating down, it

54aad35e-a55c-469a-84e7-c266d3efd15b-0
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:39.283

02:18:39.283 --> 02:18:43.510
saw out on the sea. The

the black Cape and the horn
coming out of his forehead in

54aad35e-a55c-469a-84e7-c266d3efd15b-3
02:18:48.051 --> 02:18:53.061
the back of his head, riding the

02:19:07.415 --> 02:19:09.140
with the Deep Sea Diver.

2a3c23e8-2808-47a3-89e7-415549f687cf-0
02:19:09.930 --> 02:19:11.940
Who lit up the hat.

531c0c8d-85b6-41e8-b627-760a5f3dbb95-0
02:19:12.570 --> 02:19:14.320
And then on the next page.

2cd414ca-2b6d-41ef-b317-798b78adff45-0
02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:24.072
More of the creatures that the
man who was riding the sea

2cd414ca-2b6d-41ef-b317-798b78adff45-1
02:19:24.072 --> 02:19:24.900
creature.

82fd975b-4167-471e-8e55-ff9faea2dd13-0
02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:30.260
he's pulled up and they're
walking up the steps into the

82fd975b-4167-471e-8e55-ff9faea2dd13-1
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:33.740
city, but the hat continues
along its way along the along

82fd975b-4167-471e-8e55-ff9faea2dd13-2
02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.340
the river.

af34ba8f-c4d6-4c28-91ac-20798bd95d3b-0
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:39.370
Underneath the city and just
continues on his way.

3fa3878f-36fd-44cf-8b0b-d101f0d33f81-0
02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:40.680
Next page.

abaeb2df-4394-4523-966a-945076d123d6-0
02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:47.530
And.

b40c3ffd-5f3a-4050-8b11-2db2ab040207-0
02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:49.680
The little black.

cd91e2b7-d91c-43d1-8421-3737706d9d91-0
02:19:50.390 --> 02:19:53.670
Fish from the water with the
glowing eyes.

29948ce3-fdbd-4169-af09-899b127c64a1-0
02:19:54.390 --> 02:19:57.190
And the submarine that was
following it are.

d12d99c5-7e3c-4228-a920-0712861458a8-0
02:19:58.130 --> 02:20:02.489
Shown in the picture, probably
looking at the hat as it as it

d12d99c5-7e3c-4228-a920-0712861458a8-1
02:20:02.489 --> 02:20:06.778
floats on down through the city,
down the river, through the

d12d99c5-7e3c-4228-a920-0712861458a8-2
02:20:06.778 --> 02:20:07.130
city.

8877e8ea-3490-4732-ad0b-45b65524b632-0
02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:12.846
Umm, and the the scene on the
right page shows the boat

8877e8ea-3490-4732-ad0b-45b65524b632-1
02:20:12.846 --> 02:20:18.317
following the little hat and the
hat's floating towards a group

8877e8ea-3490-4732-ad0b-45b65524b632-2
02:20:18.317 --> 02:20:20.540
of trees and a lighthouse.

8a60e154-e598-49b8-a0d6-3013efdefd9f-0
02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:23.830
That sits up on a on a wall.

fa572165-919d-46fb-bcbd-188fe2f5b573-0
02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:25.400
In the city.

37513254-2de2-4d6a-8914-b39cab0376d1-0
02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:27.040
Next page.

e4cf33e5-e862-4fc3-8a0f-1c4a416ab2ed-0
02:20:31.290 --> 02:20:35.640
Butt the hat seems to be
attracted to the House there's a

e4cf33e5-e862-4fc3-8a0f-1c4a416ab2ed-1
02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:37.140
light shining on it.

8092f4e9-06f0-4e57-a9ab-cad633b46c4f-0
02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:40.810
So it floats towards the house.

c54355ee-7489-43b9-823d-2e85403a5249-0
02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.520
And the tree.

d47e8074-5b44-459a-832d-2d2b051db625-0
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:45.290
Where the house sits under.

6cae977f-2969-4816-a6a3-d2ba59fe2b69-0
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:51.010
And on the next page it's broken
into four pictures or 6

6cae977f-2969-4816-a6a3-d2ba59fe2b69-1
02:20:51.010 --> 02:20:51.670
pictures.

5b431e14-1996-4b23-accb-401e67921c1b-0
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:56.937
Two on the top, two in the
middle and two in the bottom and

5b431e14-1996-4b23-accb-401e67921c1b-1
02:20:56.937 --> 02:20:57.900
the top 2 pictures.

0ef49905-924b-49d6-9dac-249818994b23-0
02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:02.580
One picture is of the hat
floating on water.

57a4a2ee-127d-4a04-9e1c-bd2022ccd251-0
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:07.690
With a slight shadow looks like
a,

43227f26-7b4a-4eed-8a05-5e3cd3035de3-0
02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:12.830
A head, a body, the next.

67193776-5931-4543-bab6-2e78e2d8ebb0-0
02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:16.060
Picture on top right.

50214133-4e49-47d6-b42c-d86df8c45c47-0
02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:21.657
Is the hat still floating. But
there's it's becoming clearer

50214133-4e49-47d6-b42c-d86df8c45c47-1
02:21:21.657 --> 02:21:24.180
that there is a shadow on the
hat.

d845db65-de7c-4b75-adb4-5601ef994340-0
02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.740
And the hat's beginning to fade.

16286ee2-a00e-47be-8c79-1558d54c5c75-0
02:21:28.330 --> 02:21:33.678
And the next line down the first
picture to the left the the the

16286ee2-a00e-47be-8c79-1558d54c5c75-1
02:21:33.678 --> 02:21:38.697
shadow is getting off the hat
and the hat is fading more and

16286ee2-a00e-47be-8c79-1558d54c5c75-2
02:21:38.697 --> 02:21:43.963
then the shadow gets clearer and
it starts to walk up steps and

16286ee2-a00e-47be-8c79-1558d54c5c75-3
02:21:43.963 --> 02:21:47.090
the hat begins to fade into the
wall.

331ae618-f8eb-4d2d-8be3-657a61819b43-0
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:50.060
And then the shadow.

bbc8bf19-743e-44eb-b1ad-d93cdf3c7d0b-0
02:21:50.810 --> 02:21:52.710
Becomes a full human.

597be067-94d7-4c64-aeea-b953a7884f17-0
02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:54.250
Person.

23ccfa0e-b5d1-4be2-ab8b-37e8fa175e22-0
02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:00.193
And starts climbing steps. The
hat is gone and climbs these

23ccfa0e-b5d1-4be2-ab8b-37e8fa175e22-1
02:22:00.193 --> 02:22:05.394
steps to what looks like another
person, but you only see the

23ccfa0e-b5d1-4be2-ab8b-37e8fa175e22-2
02:22:05.394 --> 02:22:10.427
bottom parts of the legs. And
then the final block, the the

23ccfa0e-b5d1-4be2-ab8b-37e8fa175e22-3
02:22:10.427 --> 02:22:15.796
second scene, third line down is
some you can see both pairs of

23ccfa0e-b5d1-4be2-ab8b-37e8fa175e22-4
02:22:15.796 --> 02:22:21.332
legs, one black pair of legs and
one white pair of legs on top of

23ccfa0e-b5d1-4be2-ab8b-37e8fa175e22-5
02:22:21.332 --> 02:22:21.919
a wall.

31eb4c3e-8a0f-4145-b714-679a265b2dc0-0
02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:24.060
Meeting. #END_wanderer

02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:30.510
OK.

22cccff6-0c92-45e0-8ef0-2fc78eb233bd-0
02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:32.820
Let me.
