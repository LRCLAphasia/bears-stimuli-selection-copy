00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.670
For the.

b3f2493a-4a62-43db-a793-4e2260825ac8-0
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.066
OK, so in our study you will see
two types of pictures. The first

b3f2493a-4a62-43db-a793-4e2260825ac8-1
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.810
type is complex scenes.

941df3d5-68ce-4602-997f-1663df0d1cf1-0
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.505
Imagine that you're describing
the scene to someone who cannot

941df3d5-68ce-4602-997f-1663df0d1cf1-1
00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.611
see the picture. Describe what
is happening and what you see as

941df3d5-68ce-4602-997f-1663df0d1cf1-2
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:29.652
thoroughly as possible, and I
will time between three and five

941df3d5-68ce-4602-997f-1663df0d1cf1-3
00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:30.230
minutes.

485a08ab-38a0-491a-b807-66f4208669e9-0
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.150
Just start when you're ready.

05ca3c6c-7d2a-4b0b-8095-fddb9407251a-0
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.710
#START_airport This appears like
it is a picture in a book. It

05ca3c6c-7d2a-4b0b-8095-fddb9407251a-1
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.740
takes the entire page, so it's a
very big and complex picture.

7ee5c165-4dd7-4ab0-bf25-303aa59df7ab-0
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.071
And as you look at the picture,
you also will notice that in

7ee5c165-4dd7-4ab0-bf25-303aa59df7ab-1
00:00:58.071 --> 00:00:58.460
the.

82cc0ec0-1313-4071-84b1-bc1b400e5682-0
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.260
Left Upper Corner there is a
postcard a little bit set at an

82cc0ec0-1313-4071-84b1-bc1b400e5682-1
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.300
angle on top of the picture. You
can actually see that it's on

82cc0ec0-1313-4071-84b1-bc1b400e5682-2
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.820
top because there's a shadow
underneath it.

6d80b611-ab8e-4dee-8844-dbabe35b7fe4-0
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.745
So this tells you, um, and I'm
going to read the postcard to

6d80b611-ab8e-4dee-8844-dbabe35b7fe4-1
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:23.976
Waldo, folks, under the carpet,
under the bed, down under, and

6d80b611-ab8e-4dee-8844-dbabe35b7fe4-2
00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:29.041
it says it's me again, Waldo
folks, some very strange things

6d80b611-ab8e-4dee-8844-dbabe35b7fe4-3
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.940
happened at the airport this
morning. A helicopter chopped

6d80b611-ab8e-4dee-8844-dbabe35b7fe4-4
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.341
down all the flagpoles, a
smuggler was caught hiding

6d80b611-ab8e-4dee-8844-dbabe35b7fe4-5
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:43.489
watches under his beard, and a
herd of elephants was getting.

86871ae2-bb51-42b6-8757-f25e40ce4a93-0
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.350
Onto a jumbo jet. Weird. And he
signed it. Waldo and the stamp

86871ae2-bb51-42b6-8757-f25e40ce4a93-1
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.028
in the upper right corner of
that postcard shows a picture of

86871ae2-bb51-42b6-8757-f25e40ce4a93-2
00:01:55.028 --> 00:02:00.066
Waldo. And the postmark says
where's Waldo and it says

86871ae2-bb51-42b6-8757-f25e40ce4a93-3
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:05.928
airport. So that's the postcard.
As you go back to the picture,

86871ae2-bb51-42b6-8757-f25e40ce4a93-4
00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:11.240
it is a scene of this very
airport that was described. So

86871ae2-bb51-42b6-8757-f25e40ce4a93-5
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.080
you're viewing it from the top.

1a8845bf-dc7f-432a-8566-7933680db825-0
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.668
Above everything, and we'll
start at the middle. The middle

1a8845bf-dc7f-432a-8566-7933680db825-1
00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:24.460
is the biggest plane that you
see.

a8897042-6eb3-4334-bdc4-def900bd059f-0
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.574
Let's go ahead and describe that
plane first. So that plane has

a8897042-6eb3-4334-bdc4-def900bd059f-1
00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:37.932
just landed because there are
people coming down the stairs

a8897042-6eb3-4334-bdc4-def900bd059f-2
00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:43.646
and going to the left when they
get down the staircase into the

a8897042-6eb3-4334-bdc4-def900bd059f-3
00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:48.825
terminal and you can see those
same people going into the

a8897042-6eb3-4334-bdc4-def900bd059f-4
00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:54.004
terminal. We'll talk about the
terminal later back to the

a8897042-6eb3-4334-bdc4-def900bd059f-5
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.130
plane. There are people
attending.

34439358-6077-4696-89b4-00dc3854ab95-0
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.173
That plane that are taking
luggage off directly underneath

34439358-6077-4696-89b4-00dc3854ab95-1
00:03:02.173 --> 00:03:02.760
it and.

2158510d-e018-460e-b47e-687fdb713296-0
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.850
Relaying all of the luggage to
12345 people, putting them on a

2158510d-e018-460e-b47e-687fdb713296-1
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.740
long luggage cart that has a
tractor like motor vehicle at

2158510d-e018-460e-b47e-687fdb713296-2
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.332
the top. Actually there's
another person at the back of

2158510d-e018-460e-b47e-687fdb713296-3
00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:22.630
that as well.

1facec24-27a5-4bf6-be9c-1e06a1852fa5-0
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.430
Moving upward just a bit, since
those guys are underneath the

1facec24-27a5-4bf6-be9c-1e06a1852fa5-1
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.680
train, there is a wing that they
are under and on top of that

1facec24-27a5-4bf6-be9c-1e06a1852fa5-2
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.099
wing there is another attendant
pointing to things that need to

1facec24-27a5-4bf6-be9c-1e06a1852fa5-3
00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.264
be done. And then further back
on the plane is the back door

1facec24-27a5-4bf6-be9c-1e06a1852fa5-4
00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:50.768
and there's no one coming out of
that part, but there is a truck

1facec24-27a5-4bf6-be9c-1e06a1852fa5-5
00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:54.410
with a lift on it that has one,
I believe.

27d1e469-537d-4dd7-a526-43f9e8c55174-0
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.260
One attendant um going into the
plane and probably going to

27d1e469-537d-4dd7-a526-43f9e8c55174-1
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.279
bring things that they need. As
far as supplies up on the very

27d1e469-537d-4dd7-a526-43f9e8c55174-2
00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:08.980
top of the plane, between the
two wings is another person.

cdcb9b2a-910a-4f0a-bc51-3463cc52694e-0
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.167
Also, looks like they're
directing someone and I'm

cdcb9b2a-910a-4f0a-bc51-3463cc52694e-1
00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:16.910
looking to see now.

025688e7-86ea-4524-b1f7-25a048801a33-0
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.571
OK, toward the back of the plane
there are other people directing

025688e7-86ea-4524-b1f7-25a048801a33-1
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.907
things. And then we go further
back to where it says that

025688e7-86ea-4524-b1f7-25a048801a33-2
00:04:29.907 --> 00:04:35.242
things were being chopped down
and everything was kind of

025688e7-86ea-4524-b1f7-25a048801a33-3
00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:40.854
crazy. So behind the plane is
what looks like a fire engine,

025688e7-86ea-4524-b1f7-25a048801a33-4
00:04:40.854 --> 00:04:46.926
with people kind of either lying
on the ground behind it and then

025688e7-86ea-4524-b1f7-25a048801a33-5
00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:48.490
people directing.

d888f7ea-5419-4a0e-857f-b0bdc13c2788-0
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.284
In front of it and
probably the firemen spraying a

d888f7ea-5419-4a0e-857f-b0bdc13c2788-1
00:04:54.284 --> 00:04:59.829
hose onto a fire. So as you look
at that, we're moving to the

d888f7ea-5419-4a0e-857f-b0bdc13c2788-2
00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:04.927
right in the middle of the
picture and there is an older

d888f7ea-5419-4a0e-857f-b0bdc13c2788-3
00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:10.383
plane like a biplane that has
people around it and an ace of

d888f7ea-5419-4a0e-857f-b0bdc13c2788-4
00:05:10.383 --> 00:05:15.660
spades sitting in the seat on
top of it. Very interesting. #END_airport 

b6aa9346-e61e-4f48-86e2-3ba084e49fbf-0
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.010
About 5 minutes.

4ee336bc-dfb2-4ba5-982a-5f44a95c7437-0
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.330
Yeah, that's a complex picture
to describe. Yes, it is, and I

4ee336bc-dfb2-4ba5-982a-5f44a95c7437-1
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.760
think it might be.

82676b58-fdfe-4959-909f-debd5dde24e0-0
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.450
Better to focus on the picture
and just you don't have to talk

82676b58-fdfe-4959-909f-debd5dde24e0-1
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.120
about the postcard. Ohh OK I
would yeah that will help to.

cea7e39c-cd7c-4271-a8f1-2e828724443b-0
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.433
Allocate more time in actually
talking about what's happening.

cea7e39c-cd7c-4271-a8f1-2e828724443b-1
00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:47.520
OK, OK, you need me to do it
again? Nope. You're good. OK,

cea7e39c-cd7c-4271-a8f1-2e828724443b-2
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.399
just as I get another picture.
OK, you will get another

cea7e39c-cd7c-4271-a8f1-2e828724443b-3
00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:54.170
picture. More of an overview.
OK. Yes.

46629da8-9b98-41eb-9f47-1c7c4137b197-0
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.430
Alright, so this is the second
picture and you can start to

46629da8-9b98-41eb-9f47-1c7c4137b197-1
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.900
describe it when you're ready.

727308f0-cb79-402d-973f-6a9683890b3a-0
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.280
#START_birthday_party_fun OK
this.

b1707671-3e4f-48ac-aa6e-4b7c315f5b91-0
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.872
Is a full page picture as well.
Looks like it's from a book and

b1707671-3e4f-48ac-aa6e-4b7c315f5b91-1
00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:22.278
on the right hand bottom corner
it has a description that says

b1707671-3e4f-48ac-aa6e-4b7c315f5b91-2
00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:27.341
birthday party fun so that
alerts you to what is going on.

b1707671-3e4f-48ac-aa6e-4b7c315f5b91-3
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:32.061
This appears to be in a
backyard, possibly a park, but

b1707671-3e4f-48ac-aa6e-4b7c315f5b91-4
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:37.554
it looks like a big backyard to
me. Over to the left is a table

b1707671-3e4f-48ac-aa6e-4b7c315f5b91-5
00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:41.329
with presents stacked on it as
bottom left.

4f9510de-b5a1-4bc6-90cd-5f21c6ea7501-0
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.333
is where you actually walk into
the gated entrance of this

4f9510de-b5a1-4bc6-90cd-5f21c6ea7501-1
00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:51.684
backyard and as you look to the
right there is a swimming pool.

4f9510de-b5a1-4bc6-90cd-5f21c6ea7501-2
00:06:51.684 --> 00:06:57.036
It looks like one of those blow
up swimming pools with a lot of

4f9510de-b5a1-4bc6-90cd-5f21c6ea7501-3
00:06:57.036 --> 00:07:02.136
children in it in bathing suits.
If you look directly ahead,

4f9510de-b5a1-4bc6-90cd-5f21c6ea7501-4
00:07:02.136 --> 00:07:07.153
there is one of those  bounce
houses, I would guess I would

4f9510de-b5a1-4bc6-90cd-5f21c6ea7501-5
00:07:07.153 --> 00:07:11.920
call it. It's very large. It's
in the shape of a castle.

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-0
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.157
And there are kids all over it.
Some are in costumes. So I guess

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-1
00:07:17.157 --> 00:07:22.352
this might be a costume party if
you're not in the pool. Yes, now

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-2
00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:27.076
that I look at it, everyone's in
costumes. And so there's a

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-3
00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:32.035
costume, children jumping all
over that and sliding down it as

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-4
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:36.838
well. And then let's go back to
the the entryway. And as you

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-5
00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:41.797
walk in and that present table
is on your left there, the next

40bcb6dd-eb2e-4c9e-ae44-08e96bedee36-6
00:07:41.797 --> 00:07:42.270
table.

07e9f0cf-6d22-43a2-8798-d52387acdb89-0
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.410
On the left.

596528f1-a911-4528-85ac-7ae107d7ddee-0
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.330
Going lengthwise is um.

e7f98a27-5426-4ad7-8caf-c721c165cd37-0
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.258
Filled with food. Looks like
cakes and cupcakes and maybe

e7f98a27-5426-4ad7-8caf-c721c165cd37-1
00:07:53.258 --> 00:07:58.437
even salads. So maybe there's
something substantial there. And

e7f98a27-5426-4ad7-8caf-c721c165cd37-2
00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:03.699
there's a Baker there with this
really tall. Must be a dessert,

e7f98a27-5426-4ad7-8caf-c721c165cd37-3
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:08.632
but I can't tell what it looks
like. It's nothing like I've

e7f98a27-5426-4ad7-8caf-c721c165cd37-4
00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:13.811
ever seen. And then further to
the left, along the the side of

e7f98a27-5426-4ad7-8caf-c721c165cd37-5
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:18.580
the backyard, it is totally
enclosed with a wooden fence.

57cb782b-0290-464f-b16e-d2bdd6f818bb-0
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.965
And there's a tree there that
has some lanterns, and one of

57cb782b-0290-464f-b16e-d2bdd6f818bb-1
00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:27.339
the neighbors is peering over.
There's also flags draped. It's

57cb782b-0290-464f-b16e-d2bdd6f818bb-2
00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:31.505
very celebratory. And then
further back on the left corner,

57cb782b-0290-464f-b16e-d2bdd6f818bb-3
00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:35.879
there are more trees and there's
some shrubbery back there. It

57cb782b-0290-464f-b16e-d2bdd6f818bb-4
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:39.490
looks like people are even
hiding in the shrubbery.

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-0
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.686
And then if, wow, if you go
along all the way along the

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-1
00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:50.618
perimeter and you find the right
side coming back toward the

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-2
00:08:50.618 --> 00:08:55.306
front entrance, there are
there's some more trees. And it

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-3
00:08:55.306 --> 00:09:00.156
looks like it's not totally
rectangular. At first I thought

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-4
00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:04.764
it was, but it looks like it
goes over to the right. And

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-5
00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:09.210
there are those flags
everywhere, balloons everywhere,

c61284ca-f6b1-435b-b2a6-6f00096ad7d3-6
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.070
some are being held by.

7544f56e-19fb-46e0-b662-ca4e8db69896-0
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.180
People,
and some are, are fastened to

7544f56e-19fb-46e0-b662-ca4e8db69896-1
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.140
the fence. Actually, the front
part of the fence has a hedge

7544f56e-19fb-46e0-b662-ca4e8db69896-2
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.880
and some of them are being
carried by people. #END_birthday_party_fun 

0d38ed40-36bb-4da8-b4b6-87b2fcb28e33-0
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.120
Other than that, it's yeah,
that's 5 minutes, OK.

78e57552-7468-4c73-8511-11822ac9cbf0-0
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.541
Was that better? Yes, now that
we get more detail of the the

78e57552-7468-4c73-8511-11822ac9cbf0-1
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.510
scene itself.

1c2bf9dd-f617-49ee-b03f-d6b28ed4b88b-0
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.060
OK, so let's try another one.

6f41d23d-5326-4433-a5d7-13e8fcb5d370-0
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.140
Hey.

b3ed552b-e7e4-4487-8861-1999abdcfbcf-0
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.850
#START_unfriendly_giants OK, so
this one is the same thing from

b3ed552b-e7e4-4487-8861-1999abdcfbcf-1
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.186
a picture book. And up in the
top left there is an

b3ed552b-e7e4-4487-8861-1999abdcfbcf-2
00:09:58.186 --> 00:10:03.372
explanation, and it's called the
unfriendly giants. So these

b3ed552b-e7e4-4487-8861-1999abdcfbcf-3
00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:08.813
giants tend to throw me off at
first. So I have to realize that

b3ed552b-e7e4-4487-8861-1999abdcfbcf-4
00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:13.744
if they're that big, all the
other stuff is going to look

b3ed552b-e7e4-4487-8861-1999abdcfbcf-5
00:10:13.744 --> 00:10:15.700
very small. So we have.

f09aa531-02cb-42b1-8ada-01746135825c-0
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:22.027
A number of giants just
guessing. It looks about 15 to

f09aa531-02cb-42b1-8ada-01746135825c-1
00:10:22.027 --> 00:10:22.340
20.

2487a521-185d-4d7f-9866-0406b105c5f8-0
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.403
And and they're much bigger in
the front of the picture than

2487a521-185d-4d7f-9866-0406b105c5f8-1
00:10:26.403 --> 00:10:29.564
they are toward the back of the
picture. So you've got some

2487a521-185d-4d7f-9866-0406b105c5f8-2
00:10:29.564 --> 00:10:31.250
perspective here and some depth.

70dd3506-f740-45f9-b09e-9ca2adfd0912-0
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.493
There's a house on the bottom
left and toward the bottom

70dd3506-f740-45f9-b09e-9ca2adfd0912-1
00:10:38.493 --> 00:10:44.500
center, and those houses are
much smaller than the Giants,

70dd3506-f740-45f9-b09e-9ca2adfd0912-2
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:50.711
which is interesting. And then
you see people, regular sized

70dd3506-f740-45f9-b09e-9ca2adfd0912-3
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:57.430
people everywhere, and there are
123456 giants playing what looks

70dd3506-f740-45f9-b09e-9ca2adfd0912-4
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.940
like.

c13ffc4c-b954-4d4d-8d58-f4fc8da51ddb-0
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.396
Chess on I'm I'm going to say
it's chess because it's got

c13ffc4c-b954-4d4d-8d58-f4fc8da51ddb-1
00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:10.550
people on it instead of like
little checkers, but they are

c13ffc4c-b954-4d4d-8d58-f4fc8da51ddb-2
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.870
playing, the Giants are playing
with.

c51e4697-9187-4c9d-8688-7f8aa297cff5-0
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.120
Probably. Probably real people.

a4f8fbba-a5b8-41ab-9f51-7ecd38896f86-0
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.930
On the chess board, that's
interesting.

f6963014-9007-4484-8297-165743397e91-0
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.270
In the middle of the picture
going left to right is what?

20eb29e9-5245-494a-851d-7a5e9a981755-0
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:35.850
Looks to me like a river, but
there's nothing that I can see

20eb29e9-5245-494a-851d-7a5e9a981755-1
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.870
that is affecting the giants
like they're in a river.

60ab0da2-3a3e-4231-88fd-ae0fd260a57c-0
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.285
The people in the river are in
boats and such, but but the

60ab0da2-3a3e-4231-88fd-ae0fd260a57c-1
00:11:48.285 --> 00:11:54.164
Giants aren't affected like
they're in a river, so maybe

60ab0da2-3a3e-4231-88fd-ae0fd260a57c-2
00:11:54.164 --> 00:12:00.867
this is a picture of everything
that the giants are standing on.

60ab0da2-3a3e-4231-88fd-ae0fd260a57c-3
00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:07.468
In the background there are two
windmills and one on each side,

60ab0da2-3a3e-4231-88fd-ae0fd260a57c-4
00:12:07.468 --> 00:12:12.110
and something that looks like a
castle or a.

bc784739-a5f2-45ef-be7f-ea3a766fd760-0
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.852
Tunnel people are walking into
it and through it, but they but

bc784739-a5f2-45ef-be7f-ea3a766fd760-1
00:12:18.852 --> 00:12:22.760
the giants are towering over it
and.

ab8c5508-bc46-4033-b5f6-90c814931686-0
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.866
It has a thatched roof in two
places, and one of the roofs

ab8c5508-bc46-4033-b5f6-90c814931686-1
00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:33.610
looks like it's being tipped off
by people underneath it.

ab8c5508-bc46-4033-b5f6-90c814931686-2
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.518
Actually, I now see two more
windmills, but they're way far

ab8c5508-bc46-4033-b5f6-90c814931686-3
00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:41.790
away in the background, left and
right.

6ec5a4b9-8ff6-4328-a212-fcc2b776255c-0
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.260
There are.

ef7d139f-e531-4b45-b017-276582d14ac7-0
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:50.809
3 structures that four
structures that are wooden and

ef7d139f-e531-4b45-b017-276582d14ac7-1
00:12:50.809 --> 00:12:56.554
tall. They're as tall as the
giants and they have and I

ef7d139f-e531-4b45-b017-276582d14ac7-2
00:12:56.554 --> 00:13:03.325
initially would have called them
a catapult, but they have like a

ef7d139f-e531-4b45-b017-276582d14ac7-3
00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:09.788
a log on a long stick like it
would be a log hammer on the top

ef7d139f-e531-4b45-b017-276582d14ac7-4
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:15.020
of it. I cannot tell what those
would be used for.

0bb05518-a68e-4deb-bfcd-8c0d2b216928-0
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.773
And I'm not gonna read to see if
there's an explanation. The

0bb05518-a68e-4deb-bfcd-8c0d2b216928-1
00:13:20.773 --> 00:13:23.590
houses that belong to the
people.

468208b7-3847-42e3-81fc-8cd467246443-0
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:32.376
All have thatched roofs and you
can see some birds on one and

468208b7-3847-42e3-81fc-8cd467246443-1
00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:39.981
the houses themselves look like
they would be in an old English

468208b7-3847-42e3-81fc-8cd467246443-2
00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:47.467
kind of countryside with a kind
of stucco and wood with wooden

468208b7-3847-42e3-81fc-8cd467246443-3
00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:48.180
doors.

5b10e9b8-615f-475d-b24b-06957185452f-0
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.384
Other
than that, there's a garden

5b10e9b8-615f-475d-b24b-06957185452f-1
00:13:54.384 --> 00:13:59.948
backed by the castle. Looks like
apple trees. Maybe so there this

5b10e9b8-615f-475d-b24b-06957185452f-2
00:13:59.948 --> 00:14:05.174
is quite a little city, but the
Giants make it look like it's

5b10e9b8-615f-475d-b24b-06957185452f-3
00:14:05.174 --> 00:14:06.860
not very big at all. #END_unfriendly_giants 

2a97f649-7d5a-4eec-8f09-646c0fe2eaa5-0
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.320
Yeah, that was five minutes,
OK.

3f90019f-a97d-40c7-8557-64576840e5cb-0
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.030
OK.

b6669f79-0c14-42e3-813f-b109a1891ec3-0
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.700
Do you have like a feel for how
it goes now?

862a7ac7-aaa6-4540-872e-a3ab73d10fba-0
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.190
You see, do you think I'm
improving? Yes.

d3d6f7e5-f982-438e-ac44-6296ac1926fe-0
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.650
OK. OK.

ba75cbaa-54b1-4712-9707-16b1b55008b8-0
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.050
So going on to the next scene.

8c8543b3-74ec-4f0b-9e7f-6d72570b6c46-0
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.110
Ah.

98438885-121d-4925-a776-5935e163c220-0
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.200
OK.

7ac446e1-d250-419e-93de-20c3f4621b7f-0
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.124
#START_waldo_1 This is another
page from this Waldo kind of

7ac446e1-d250-419e-93de-20c3f4621b7f-1
00:14:48.124 --> 00:14:51.320
book and the description on the

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.730
Appears to be um.

dbbf9c4d-3bda-4ddf-ae6d-bd9eaa411775-0
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.060
An introduction and Waldo was at
the top.

84f2c5dd-4faf-4860-9f15-555a5ffb117b-0
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:07.699
So as I look at this without
reading it, this looks like what

84f2c5dd-4faf-4860-9f15-555a5ffb117b-1
00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:12.830
you would expect to see in a
rather modern.

99838bba-1227-447f-b6ee-1e56d5933590-0
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.983
Yeah, rather modern city from
looking down on it from above.

99838bba-1227-447f-b6ee-1e56d5933590-1
00:15:20.983 --> 00:15:26.742
Not straight above, but at an
angle. So let's describe the

99838bba-1227-447f-b6ee-1e56d5933590-2
00:15:26.742 --> 00:15:32.891
city where it looks like we're
in the center of town. There is

99838bba-1227-447f-b6ee-1e56d5933590-3
00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:34.160
a triangular.

2ae1e341-f499-41ad-83c2-ca43dd72f2e6-0
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.444
Instead of a town square, it's a
town triangle, and in the middle

2ae1e341-f499-41ad-83c2-ca43dd72f2e6-1
00:15:40.444 --> 00:15:44.875
is a fountain. And there's a
scuba diver on the very top of

2ae1e341-f499-41ad-83c2-ca43dd72f2e6-2
00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:49.232
the fountain being bounced
around by the water. People are

2ae1e341-f499-41ad-83c2-ca43dd72f2e6-3
00:15:49.232 --> 00:15:53.590
looking at him and walking
around that fountain. There's a

2ae1e341-f499-41ad-83c2-ca43dd72f2e6-4
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:58.390
statue on one of the corners of
that triangle. In the center you

2ae1e341-f499-41ad-83c2-ca43dd72f2e6-5
00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:58.760
have.

2c47719e-61e8-43a8-861e-6da84ae6b0e1-0
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.968
Buildings all around it, many of
which have striped awnings on

2c47719e-61e8-43a8-861e-6da84ae6b0e1-1
00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:07.450
them.

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-0
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.997
Actually, let's just say
several, of which there are also

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-1
00:16:13.997 --> 00:16:18.484
appears to be a farmers market
at the bottom of the picture and

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-2
00:16:18.484 --> 00:16:22.972
some sorts of stalls. And they
also have those striped awnings,

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-3
00:16:22.972 --> 00:16:26.969
which is why I at a first
glance, it looked like more of

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-4
00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:31.387
the buildings had them, but only
a few buildings have them. So

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-5
00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:35.384
there's people in the farmers
market buying all kinds of

810289f4-eaf9-4363-a397-9ac3ed22c32a-6
00:16:35.384 --> 00:16:38.539
things and all ages of people
you see young.

e9606305-04ea-4f07-a5f4-69bd770982c8-0
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:44.696
Young people running around, you
see an older person with a cane,

e9606305-04ea-4f07-a5f4-69bd770982c8-1
00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:49.334
um, little children, and it
appears that it's very well

e9606305-04ea-4f07-a5f4-69bd770982c8-2
00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:54.304
attended to the left of the
farmers market. There's a large

e9606305-04ea-4f07-a5f4-69bd770982c8-3
00:16:54.304 --> 00:16:55.050
building.

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-0
00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.207
Um, that is white. It's
rectangular and it it's under

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-1
00:17:00.207 --> 00:17:05.244
construction or repair, even
though there are things going on

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-2
00:17:05.244 --> 00:17:09.875
inside of it. So you have
someone walking inside through

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-3
00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:15.156
the windows. You can see various
offices and probably buildings.

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-4
00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:20.031
I mean services. But you also
see on the outside that there

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-5
00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:25.393
are three ladders with people on
them, either cleaning windows. I

fa2bd1f6-f967-4b35-a33a-093741b4a05d-6
00:17:25.393 --> 00:17:26.450
only see two.

9a957a98-4f25-4ae9-86d9-a41f8966c571-0
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.295
People, and one of them looks
like he's cleaning a window, so

9a957a98-4f25-4ae9-86d9-a41f8966c571-1
00:17:31.295 --> 00:17:35.685
that's probably what is
happening. But on the roof there

9a957a98-4f25-4ae9-86d9-a41f8966c571-2
00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:40.153
are more workmen and looks like
maybe there's pigeons and

9a957a98-4f25-4ae9-86d9-a41f8966c571-3
00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:44.697
they're taking a break and
feeding them and playing around

9a957a98-4f25-4ae9-86d9-a41f8966c571-4
00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:49.395
with with their buckets on their
heads and their mops like a

9a957a98-4f25-4ae9-86d9-a41f8966c571-5
00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:53.169
sword fight. So it must be a
break of some sort.

2ba1942e-1236-4867-be73-a836a5302d63-0
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.220
Um, to the right there is.

fe7b3a88-2f13-40e5-a138-b577babddd0d-0
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:06.399
A building that has a fancy
front on it, it possibly is a

fe7b3a88-2f13-40e5-a138-b577babddd0d-1
00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:12.628
bank, but it doesn't give an
indication that it's a bank.

fe7b3a88-2f13-40e5-a138-b577babddd0d-2
00:18:12.628 --> 00:18:19.071
People in the streets are on
motorcycles, bicycles walking,

fe7b3a88-2f13-40e5-a138-b577babddd0d-3
00:18:19.071 --> 00:18:25.300
little cars, bigger cars, a
truck. Further back you see a

fe7b3a88-2f13-40e5-a138-b577babddd0d-4
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.160
bus and.

91ce36d1-f79e-4ae5-a677-b8cadc74e0df-0
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.720
There's one.

8d58198c-9641-4ae9-8e52-064e644c52ab-0
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.200
2-3, maybe you can see three or
four blocks. A fire house is on

8d58198c-9641-4ae9-8e52-064e644c52ab-1
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.159
the upper right corner of the
picture, so it's a couple of

8d58198c-9641-4ae9-8e52-064e644c52ab-2
00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:45.371
blocks over with a fire engine
coming out of it. Next to that

8d58198c-9641-4ae9-8e52-064e644c52ab-3
00:18:45.371 --> 00:18:50.499
is another building with people
going in and out, and on the

8d58198c-9641-4ae9-8e52-064e644c52ab-4
00:18:50.499 --> 00:18:56.047
left side of the Firehouse there
are people looking in the window

8d58198c-9641-4ae9-8e52-064e644c52ab-5
00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:59.410
like they're window shopping and
above.

38e7f0a0-2bdf-4849-9ae3-66c48e191766-0
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.669
Those buildings there are rooms
where people are living or

38e7f0a0-2bdf-4849-9ae3-66c48e191766-1
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:07.220
working and you can see them
through the windows.

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-0
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.216
If you're at the
town triangle and at the top of

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-1
00:19:13.216 --> 00:19:17.467
it in the picture, you go
directly up there and there is a

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-2
00:19:17.467 --> 00:19:21.934
mechanics place and a mechanic
is working on a car with tools

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-3
00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:26.041
all over the ground and it's
apparently a gas station as

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-4
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:30.436
well. I see a gas pump, although
no one is pumping gas right

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-5
00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:34.543
behind it. #END_waldo_1 Did you say
something? Oh yeah, it's about 5

379592da-4d75-444f-8784-e0cee88979c1-6
00:19:34.543 --> 00:19:38.650
minutes. OK, good. Alright,
cool. So then the next one.

5430ddb0-1846-4fbc-b01f-1ae80e0cee31-0
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.465
There's something different. So
then the other type of pictures

5430ddb0-1846-4fbc-b01f-1ae80e0cee31-1
00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:45.870
that you see are graphic
novels.

c9ef4e20-fad1-4b2d-a898-5f1f5aa03449-0
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.066
Which are a series of pictures
that tell a story. Describe what

c9ef4e20-fad1-4b2d-a898-5f1f5aa03449-1
00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:56.744
you see and what is happening as
you go through the story, and

c9ef4e20-fad1-4b2d-a898-5f1f5aa03449-2
00:19:56.744 --> 00:20:00.679
I'll let you know when it's
about 10 to 15 minutes.

96ae9530-2d02-4d3d-99d8-6d8451907181-0
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:08.507
OK, so story yes, is this going
to it says 30 pages, so each one

96ae9530-2d02-4d3d-99d8-6d8451907181-1
00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:13.647
will actually be different
because there are different

96ae9530-2d02-4d3d-99d8-6d8451907181-2
00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:15.330
parts of a story.

bb4ef611-8266-4985-b78e-62c4099ac294-0
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.256
The first one stop me or you
turning pages or how does that

bb4ef611-8266-4985-b78e-62c4099ac294-1
00:20:21.256 --> 00:20:26.261
work right? I'll see how it goes
when you do your first story and

bb4ef611-8266-4985-b78e-62c4099ac294-2
00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:31.191
see how we will adjust. And the
first only seeing the first page

bb4ef611-8266-4985-b78e-62c4099ac294-3
00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:33.770
of a story that's 30 pages
long.

367a3bff-ab01-4b3e-8f6f-c28ba771a995-0
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.802
Around 30 pages. OK, one is
longer, everything else are

367a3bff-ab01-4b3e-8f6f-c28ba771a995-1
00:20:39.802 --> 00:20:44.612
shorter. But they're not
separate stories. Some are

367a3bff-ab01-4b3e-8f6f-c28ba771a995-2
00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:50.255
separate stories, some are all
part of the same book. OK, so

367a3bff-ab01-4b3e-8f6f-c28ba771a995-3
00:20:50.255 --> 00:20:55.990
you will see familiar style,
maybe not very complete stories,

367a3bff-ab01-4b3e-8f6f-c28ba771a995-4
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.060
but OK yeah, so I only
describing the the.

78d2154b-18c4-48d1-8868-c01c8d0e2fc8-0
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.155
The content of the one that I'm
looking at at the time. Or will

78d2154b-18c4-48d1-8868-c01c8d0e2fc8-1
00:21:05.155 --> 00:21:05.350
I?

024d5b56-42f4-4701-8659-ec70074ab651-0
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.650
Will I be suggesting that it
will be going on?

a10d63e8-8436-4894-bdf3-287035be410a-0
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.030
Umm.

ef9f1ea1-a1f3-4040-b044-702447d3b037-0
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.330
You will only see the the pages
on the screen.

1530c2e9-e500-471c-8fdc-ae7c8d9708e5-0
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.768
Really describing that one at
the time, right. And you're

1530c2e9-e500-471c-8fdc-ae7c8d9708e5-1
00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:29.025
talking about those pages, but
you can, if you feel like it,

1530c2e9-e500-471c-8fdc-ae7c8d9708e5-2
00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:33.423
you can use transitional words
like and then and then you wait

1530c2e9-e500-471c-8fdc-ae7c8d9708e5-3
00:21:33.423 --> 00:21:34.470
for. Yeah, OK.

3c8fac16-5a2f-4c65-8687-5e5f4519ad83-0
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:40.749
OK. The first one that we're
going to do is around 20 pages,

3c8fac16-5a2f-4c65-8687-5e5f4519ad83-1
00:21:40.749 --> 00:21:41.100
OK.

f0739226-5f3f-4fbf-aa23-d2e796d51dab-0
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.800
And you're going to turn the
pages.

e9740b99-da0c-4e9d-a7a5-61369bbba221-0
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.100
If you're done describing the
pages, I'll turn OK pages OK.

be3a0a8f-b219-4674-bea4-fa030c05258e-0
00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:00.968
#START_journey OK, so we're
starting a story here that

be3a0a8f-b219-4674-bea4-fa030c05258e-1
00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:06.932
doesn't have words. It is done
in sepia tones, mainly as you

be3a0a8f-b219-4674-bea4-fa030c05258e-2
00:22:06.932 --> 00:22:12.800
look at the pictures, which
indicates that it's some older.

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-0
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.914
it looks like it's set in a
city, and on the left hand side

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-1
00:22:18.914 --> 00:22:23.316
of the page you have a tall
building. It looks like it's

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-2
00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:28.182
three stories with an attic and
a basement. There's a big door

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-3
00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:32.970
going into it, and there's some
children playing outside by a

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-4
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.295
street lamp. It's also on a
corner, so you have traffic

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-5
00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:41.929
lights and a directional arrow
across the street from that,

dd1b30c0-4ab8-4769-ae6e-da5f8c6556ef-6
00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:45.560
which brings us to the right
side of the page.

64a8b6dd-e14a-4cf6-980a-a7f9b0a3ad5c-0
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.488
There is another building, and
this building, you don't see the

64a8b6dd-e14a-4cf6-980a-a7f9b0a3ad5c-1
00:22:52.488 --> 00:22:57.465
exterior, it's cut away so that
you see the interior of the

64a8b6dd-e14a-4cf6-980a-a7f9b0a3ad5c-2
00:22:57.465 --> 00:23:02.358
building like you would a
dollhouse. And I also notice now

64a8b6dd-e14a-4cf6-980a-a7f9b0a3ad5c-3
00:23:02.358 --> 00:23:07.169
that the entire bottom below
street level is exposed in a

64a8b6dd-e14a-4cf6-980a-a7f9b0a3ad5c-4
00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:12.395
cutaway across both pages, and
so you see the workings of what

64a8b6dd-e14a-4cf6-980a-a7f9b0a3ad5c-5
00:23:12.395 --> 00:23:15.630
goes on with pipes and maybe a
boiler.

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-0
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.691
Um and and a gas tank below on
this building on the right that

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-1
00:23:20.691 --> 00:23:25.732
is cut away. First I notice and
I guess I notice it because out

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-2
00:23:25.732 --> 00:23:30.221
of all the sepia tones there is
one red item and it is a

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-3
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:35.104
scooter. And there's a little
girl sitting on the steps going

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-4
00:23:35.104 --> 00:23:39.356
up into that house and the
scooter is in front of her

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-5
00:23:39.356 --> 00:23:44.003
leaning on a post and it's
totally red. Everything else is

2b6992e3-47d6-4282-902d-766aaab75266-6
00:23:44.003 --> 00:23:46.130
sepia tones except for the.

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-0
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.009
The red lights on the street
light, and they are muted. So in

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-1
00:23:51.009 --> 00:23:55.360
this cutaway house on the right,
we'll start on the bottom floor

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-2
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.376
and as you walk into the front
door there's a place to hang

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-3
00:23:59.376 --> 00:24:02.990
coats and hats. And then
immediately to the left is a

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-4
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.207
doorway that goes to a to stairs
that are curved going upward.

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-5
00:24:07.207 --> 00:24:11.490
We're not going to go upstairs
right now. We're going to finish

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-6
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.439
with that room, which is an
entryway with some pictures on

7e01b016-1518-4471-a623-be9c3b0c1361-7
00:24:15.439 --> 00:24:16.310
the wall and.

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-0
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.055
A lamp on a table. And then if
you walk through the next door

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-1
00:24:23.055 --> 00:24:27.622
and you see the cutaway of the
kitchen and there is a woman at

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-2
00:24:27.622 --> 00:24:31.900
a stove with a range hood over
it and to the right of that

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-3
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.105
there's a little cupboard and
then drawers. It looks like

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-4
00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:40.600
she's preparing a meal. There's
a couple of things there. And

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-5
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.732
then you can see the open
shelves. OK, now going back to

f6ce64e4-8aae-4eb7-846e-08cb209cb46f-6
00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:46.980
the front room, the entry room.

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-0
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.538
Where you turn left and go into
the stairwell. If you go up

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-1
00:24:51.538 --> 00:24:56.325
those stairs at the front of the
building, it appears that's an

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-2
00:24:56.325 --> 00:25:00.963
office or a library. There's a
man sitting at a desk with a a

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-3
00:25:00.963 --> 00:25:05.750
large bookshelf behind him, not
filled with books but with many

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-4
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:10.014
books. And next to that, on the
right of it is a smaller

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-5
00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:14.877
bookshelf with a good number of
books on the bottom and a couple

855f246c-b888-4b71-a406-ee5e77d292c6-6
00:25:14.877 --> 00:25:17.570
of pictures that might be
diplomas.

fc4d8d45-0891-4859-8381-7112703b9400-0
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.919
Or certificates of some some
note up at the top behind that

fc4d8d45-0891-4859-8381-7112703b9400-1
00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:28.323
as you go to the back of the
house there is another room that

fc4d8d45-0891-4859-8381-7112703b9400-2
00:25:28.323 --> 00:25:33.640
actually looks like it might be
a living room, and there is.

485964c3-da45-4574-8849-82cf2b9e7cc5-0
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:40.243
Ah, it's it looks like a young
person kind of sitting on the

485964c3-da45-4574-8849-82cf2b9e7cc5-1
00:25:40.243 --> 00:25:45.876
couch full length with back up
against the couch cushion on on

485964c3-da45-4574-8849-82cf2b9e7cc5-2
00:25:45.876 --> 00:25:51.329
the side, little table there
with a big picture up above it.

6d3f2ac7-a400-42c5-9def-36b390e6d584-0
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.340
So then as you turn the page.

e9e738de-f334-4d72-abe6-fb4f3f4110bc-0
00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.810
We see.

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-0
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:06.560
Some several scenes that are not
filling the page. They are just

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-1
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.530
little things that are happening
telling part of the story. So I

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-2
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:16.577
would say that the girl has come
inside and she's brought her red

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-3
00:26:16.577 --> 00:26:20.859
scooter in and it's still
everything is in sepia except

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-4
00:26:20.859 --> 00:26:25.370
the red scooter and the items
that the girl is holding. So

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-5
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:30.111
maybe she's key to the story. So
right now at the top of that

3aea7d29-30d3-4d39-af04-34df17d40212-6
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:32.100
picture, the little scene.

684f4f11-f8d9-4d1e-b7f8-e0fb9d44f5ea-0
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.385
Shows her in the kitchen looking
on the counter while the mother

684f4f11-f8d9-4d1e-b7f8-e0fb9d44f5ea-1
00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:42.520
is talking on on the phone. It
is an old fashioned phone on the

684f4f11-f8d9-4d1e-b7f8-e0fb9d44f5ea-2
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.574
wall and she has a long cord and
has the phone tucked up under

684f4f11-f8d9-4d1e-b7f8-e0fb9d44f5ea-3
00:26:47.574 --> 00:26:52.629
her ear while she's cooking at
the stove. Then just below that

684f4f11-f8d9-4d1e-b7f8-e0fb9d44f5ea-4
00:26:52.629 --> 00:26:57.443
is the next scene. Looks like
the little girl brought a red

684f4f11-f8d9-4d1e-b7f8-e0fb9d44f5ea-5
00:26:57.443 --> 00:26:59.610
kite in and went up to the.

477f0e83-6e0b-4d7f-be45-872f9f357d0d-0
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.961
To the top floor to see the man,
probably the father, and he is

477f0e83-6e0b-4d7f-be45-872f9f357d0d-1
00:27:05.961 --> 00:27:10.138
looking at his computer. At the
desk you don't see the

477f0e83-6e0b-4d7f-be45-872f9f357d0d-2
00:27:10.138 --> 00:27:14.771
bookshelves anymore and I did
not notice the computer in the

477f0e83-6e0b-4d7f-be45-872f9f357d0d-3
00:27:14.771 --> 00:27:19.480
other picture, so she's just
leaning on the back of his chair

477f0e83-6e0b-4d7f-be45-872f9f357d0d-4
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.620
and then below.

ab512928-6227-490f-86f7-24d40b9ff9c2-0
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.447
She is talking to the young
person on the couch, leaning on

ab512928-6227-490f-86f7-24d40b9ff9c2-1
00:27:27.447 --> 00:27:32.295
the back of the couch with a red
ball it looks like and still not

ab512928-6227-490f-86f7-24d40b9ff9c2-2
00:27:32.295 --> 00:27:36.849
getting attention. So this this
left side shows that the girl

ab512928-6227-490f-86f7-24d40b9ff9c2-3
00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:37.069
is.

aeca87f2-0fb5-462e-93f9-8102983764e1-0
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:43.408
Ready to interact I would say
with family members, but not

aeca87f2-0fb5-462e-93f9-8102983764e1-1
00:27:43.408 --> 00:27:48.576
getting the attention that she
had hoped for. So then you see

aeca87f2-0fb5-462e-93f9-8102983764e1-2
00:27:48.576 --> 00:27:53.661
on the right hand side this
little girl going up to probably

aeca87f2-0fb5-462e-93f9-8102983764e1-3
00:27:53.661 --> 00:27:58.746
what is her room. And the only
reason I say up is because if

aeca87f2-0fb5-462e-93f9-8102983764e1-4
00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:04.081
you look through the window in
that room you are doesn't appear

aeca87f2-0fb5-462e-93f9-8102983764e1-5
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:09.000
that you're at street level, it
appears that you're above.

dfa4e222-11e2-4d0a-a7d3-23eeafbc1328-0
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.366
So she's in this room by
herself, with a single bed and a

dfa4e222-11e2-4d0a-a7d3-23eeafbc1328-1
00:28:13.366 --> 00:28:18.073
dresser, a map on the wall and a
lamp, a light coming down from

dfa4e222-11e2-4d0a-a7d3-23eeafbc1328-2
00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:22.413
the ceiling, a lamp on the
dresser wastebasket next to it.

dfa4e222-11e2-4d0a-a7d3-23eeafbc1328-3
00:28:22.413 --> 00:28:23.370
And there is.

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-0
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.885
It looks, I can't tell if it's a
dog or cat, I'm sorry, I just

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-1
00:28:29.885 --> 00:28:34.265
can't tell. But there's a little
animal sleeping, probably a cat

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-2
00:28:34.265 --> 00:28:38.376
by the way, that it's rolled up
on the floor in front of the

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-3
00:28:38.376 --> 00:28:42.352
dresser. And she came and sat on
her bed leaning against a

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-4
00:28:42.352 --> 00:28:46.328
pillow, and it appears that
she's doing nothing. Her knees

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-5
00:28:46.328 --> 00:28:50.102
are up. It appears that she's
just sitting there, maybe

b930d32d-3b3c-4c09-8de6-1b99f0da61cb-6
00:28:50.102 --> 00:28:53.000
wishing that something would be
happening.

242a6cac-f47f-42e7-b02d-b5f8e08cbd04-0
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.360
Next double page spread.

e1147c68-8ee0-4f66-bf71-2508fec313d5-0
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.900
You see the girl. Same scene
with the girl in her room.

bdd33ae3-8eef-4e14-8cb2-974a0df30758-0
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.160
Ah, I only see that she's
turning to the side.

54ed1a7a-7f37-4da7-b68a-a9ea5dadcf09-0
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.510
On.

ab6fbc96-bbf3-4e2e-9958-f7fbba939859-0
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:20.015
Her position on the bed, the
cat. Now I see that it's a cat

ab6fbc96-bbf3-4e2e-9958-f7fbba939859-1
00:29:20.015 --> 00:29:25.859
has gotten up and is walking out
the door and underneath where

ab6fbc96-bbf3-4e2e-9958-f7fbba939859-2
00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:31.146
the cat was lying, we now see
what looks like a bunch of

ab6fbc96-bbf3-4e2e-9958-f7fbba939859-3
00:29:31.146 --> 00:29:34.300
papers and a red writing
utensil.

8d73f878-4a0e-419d-85c7-ac96116c69a6-0
00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:44.470
So then on the next page you see
you see something that.

f91c6248-1570-4b23-a446-2132b5ae4d88-0
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.047
Uh is like we saw before, 3
little scenes that with no

f91c6248-1570-4b23-a446-2132b5ae4d88-1
00:29:50.047 --> 00:29:55.734
background, the tops and except
these are in a descending order

f91c6248-1570-4b23-a446-2132b5ae4d88-2
00:29:55.734 --> 00:30:01.154
on a diagonal. And so the top
one shows the little girl down

f91c6248-1570-4b23-a446-2132b5ae4d88-3
00:30:01.154 --> 00:30:06.486
on the floor picking up that
writing utensil. And I'm going

f91c6248-1570-4b23-a446-2132b5ae4d88-4
00:30:06.486 --> 00:30:12.084
to call it a crayon because it's
red and so she's picking that

f91c6248-1570-4b23-a446-2132b5ae4d88-5
00:30:12.084 --> 00:30:14.750
up. The next scene going down.

87fcbd72-0550-40f0-b1c9-3fd40f314602-0
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.710
Shows her standing right next
to.

351bb1cc-fc7b-4a7d-8e43-0e8760ea5e68-0
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:24.547
Those papers on the floor with
the crayon and she's turned to

351bb1cc-fc7b-4a7d-8e43-0e8760ea5e68-1
00:30:24.547 --> 00:30:29.828
what is likely to be a wall, but
it looks like she's using her

351bb1cc-fc7b-4a7d-8e43-0e8760ea5e68-2
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:34.439
imagination and so she is
drawing a red archway on the

351bb1cc-fc7b-4a7d-8e43-0e8760ea5e68-3
00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:39.469
wall. Now it might not be on the
wall because I don't see a

351bb1cc-fc7b-4a7d-8e43-0e8760ea5e68-4
00:30:39.469 --> 00:30:44.666
background, maybe it's just in
the air, but it's showing red.

351bb1cc-fc7b-4a7d-8e43-0e8760ea5e68-5
00:30:44.666 --> 00:30:49.780
So I'm saying that it's on the
wall when you go down to the.

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-0
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:54.983
Bottom right, which is the next
photo there or the next drawing

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-1
00:30:54.983 --> 00:31:00.198
there? She has made a red door.
The papers are still in front of

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-2
00:31:00.198 --> 00:31:05.011
it, and you see her walking
through the door that she made,

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-3
00:31:05.011 --> 00:31:09.423
which is obviously an
imagination. And so she is going

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-4
00:31:09.423 --> 00:31:13.835
through that because in my
opinion, she wasn't finding

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-5
00:31:13.835 --> 00:31:18.889
anything to do and no one was
interacting. So she's making her

329e3a3a-e0e9-4d9c-b6c9-c5d484ba8ec1-6
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:19.210
own.

050db8f3-d1e5-4e11-82ea-9dbf991bc1ac-0
00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.730
Imagination of what she would
like to do.

02c7ef32-1bfe-485f-aadb-04e9e6fb7f32-0
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.900
Ah.

3888102d-c5f1-4256-a8d9-804d06660ef5-0
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:32.303
Lovely. So now we have a double
page spread that with a picture

3888102d-c5f1-4256-a8d9-804d06660ef5-1
00:31:32.303 --> 00:31:37.866
entirely filling it no longer in
sepia, so there are many, many

3888102d-c5f1-4256-a8d9-804d06660ef5-2
00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:43.343
trees. There's a big one right
in the middle, a pretty big one

3888102d-c5f1-4256-a8d9-804d06660ef5-3
00:31:43.343 --> 00:31:49.080
on the right hand side and a big
one on the left. On the left you

3888102d-c5f1-4256-a8d9-804d06660ef5-4
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.817
see where the girl came from. So
at the bottom of the tree is the

3888102d-c5f1-4256-a8d9-804d06660ef5-5
00:31:54.817 --> 00:31:56.730
red door and the girl.

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-0
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.008
Having walked through it into
this green forest, and I

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-1
00:32:01.008 --> 00:32:06.058
remember now that on the picture
before, when she was drawing the

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-2
00:32:06.058 --> 00:32:10.496
door and walking through it,
there was green on the other

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-3
00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:15.241
side of that door. So now she's
in the green world, the green

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-4
00:32:15.241 --> 00:32:19.985
forested world, and left the
sepia world behind. So I'm going

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-5
00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:25.035
to assume this means this is her
imagination and so she's walking

9004d05a-9576-4313-a48e-2419f735da31-6
00:32:25.035 --> 00:32:26.260
into it. Whoops.

562df1ab-c3e6-4867-b9f8-40e7df86534d-0
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.960
She's she still has the crayon
in her hand.

4380cfb7-385f-4aff-bde9-65348e9eb36a-0
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:37.049
In the in this forest there are
beautiful blue lanterns, kind of

4380cfb7-385f-4aff-bde9-65348e9eb36a-1
00:32:37.049 --> 00:32:42.622
elongated with different shapes
and hanging from the trees and

4380cfb7-385f-4aff-bde9-65348e9eb36a-2
00:32:42.622 --> 00:32:47.840
also stringed smaller lights.
From tree to tree there is a

4380cfb7-385f-4aff-bde9-65348e9eb36a-3
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.610
river going through.

510676a3-d46f-49a0-b23a-bf9bca832ffd-0
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.719
There's a river going through
this forest, and it's a

510676a3-d46f-49a0-b23a-bf9bca832ffd-1
00:32:54.719 --> 00:32:55.780
beautiful forest.

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-0
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.097
The river is bluish, bluish
green, and there's a dock that

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-1
00:33:01.097 --> 00:33:05.447
the little girl is now standing
on. She still has the red crayon

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-2
00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:09.060
in her hand, and there is
something floating down the

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-3
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.477
river that I honestly can't tell
what it is, but there's a little

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-4
00:33:13.477 --> 00:33:17.692
bit of red in there that's on
the left side of the page, full,

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-5
00:33:17.692 --> 00:33:21.908
full background where you see
all the beautiful forest. On the

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-6
00:33:21.908 --> 00:33:26.057
right hand side we have another
series of three drawings like

f8f513fa-c442-46f2-91ba-29118738e65f-7
00:33:26.057 --> 00:33:27.730
we've seen before and so.

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-0
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:32.624
The girl is leaning in the top
one over the edge of the dock

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-1
00:33:32.624 --> 00:33:37.173
with her red crayon and drawing
on what appears to be the

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-2
00:33:37.173 --> 00:33:42.349
surface of the water. The second
one shows that she is completing

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-3
00:33:42.349 --> 00:33:47.133
the drawing of a boat, and right
now we just see the outline

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-4
00:33:47.133 --> 00:33:52.074
while she's lying on the dock
drawing this boat below her. The

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-5
00:33:52.074 --> 00:33:56.623
next one down shows that she's
left the dock. The boat is

527c8586-f915-4686-80be-db4053039fb2-6
00:33:56.623 --> 00:33:58.820
totally completed, it's red.

fdae9623-8f1b-468f-99cd-2c01103d743b-0
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.398
Are now a totally red boat, and
she is in it and floating off

fdae9623-8f1b-468f-99cd-2c01103d743b-1
00:34:04.398 --> 00:34:09.045
toward the right, obviously on
her way to her imagined

fdae9623-8f1b-468f-99cd-2c01103d743b-2
00:34:09.045 --> 00:34:09.890
adventure.

3f5e80ae-dc59-47c9-9f2d-ed44a49d7332-0
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:17.916
Whoa. Now, this double page
spread shows that we are coming

3f5e80ae-dc59-47c9-9f2d-ed44a49d7332-1
00:34:17.916 --> 00:34:23.897
out of the forest. We we as we
watch her, she's in the red boat

3f5e80ae-dc59-47c9-9f2d-ed44a49d7332-2
00:34:23.897 --> 00:34:29.784
on the left side coming out of
the forest with the little Blue

3f5e80ae-dc59-47c9-9f2d-ed44a49d7332-3
00:34:29.784 --> 00:34:35.578
Lanterns and going down this
Little River, which empties into

3f5e80ae-dc59-47c9-9f2d-ed44a49d7332-4
00:34:35.578 --> 00:34:40.904
this big river that also
includes a Moat, or it's a Moat

3f5e80ae-dc59-47c9-9f2d-ed44a49d7332-5
00:34:40.904 --> 00:34:42.400
around a castle.

e11758ed-9ce4-43e9-b032-72ff912acb5a-0
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.636
So maybe the castle is in the
middle of the river and the

e11758ed-9ce4-43e9-b032-72ff912acb5a-1
00:34:47.636 --> 00:34:53.215
river goes around it serving as
a Moat. So as you look at this

e11758ed-9ce4-43e9-b032-72ff912acb5a-2
00:34:53.215 --> 00:34:58.971
huge beautiful castle and we are
no longer just in green, we see

e11758ed-9ce4-43e9-b032-72ff912acb5a-3
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:04.639
Browns and Blues and yellows on
the castle. But it is a totally

e11758ed-9ce4-43e9-b032-72ff912acb5a-4
00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:10.041
colored picture, even though
it's a little bit shaded on the

e11758ed-9ce4-43e9-b032-72ff912acb5a-5
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:13.230
dark side she is directly going
to.

33a81ccd-316e-44b4-810c-68ffc893c96f-0
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:18.433
What looks like a bridge over
the Moat, but that seems a

33a81ccd-316e-44b4-810c-68ffc893c96f-1
00:35:18.433 --> 00:35:23.338
little odd to me because the
bridge would have to have water

33a81ccd-316e-44b4-810c-68ffc893c96f-2
00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:28.242
in it for her to get across in
the boat. Unless it stops and

33a81ccd-316e-44b4-810c-68ffc893c96f-3
00:35:28.242 --> 00:35:31.620
she goes in. We'll find out to
the right.

3996c097-d32e-4f8c-8fd5-ed42c1d8ca3d-0
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.933
There was a huge bridge that
boats can go under, so, oh,

3996c097-d32e-4f8c-8fd5-ed42c1d8ca3d-1
00:35:37.933 --> 00:35:43.379
there's a boat above it on a
little waterway going into the

3996c097-d32e-4f8c-8fd5-ed42c1d8ca3d-2
00:35:43.379 --> 00:35:48.915
castle, so maybe hers also is a
waterway. And then there are

3996c097-d32e-4f8c-8fd5-ed42c1d8ca3d-3
00:35:48.915 --> 00:35:54.270
boats going underneath the
castle. There's a little turret

3996c097-d32e-4f8c-8fd5-ed42c1d8ca3d-4
00:35:54.270 --> 00:36:00.079
also in the middle of the Moat,
but this castle has lots of big

3996c097-d32e-4f8c-8fd5-ed42c1d8ca3d-5
00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:02.530
gold domes on it, and it's.

f043e558-91ed-442f-82fd-16823df300c9-0
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:09.051
Multi storied, not all the same.
Various heights and lots of

f043e558-91ed-442f-82fd-16823df300c9-1
00:36:09.051 --> 00:36:09.780
towers.

66654d3c-ca10-4cf6-9179-649744da6b8d-0
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:20.685
Now oh wow. OK, now we see that
this castle quite an imagination

66654d3c-ca10-4cf6-9179-649744da6b8d-1
00:36:20.685 --> 00:36:23.000
that this castle has.

1c6a9370-7f07-4bf7-9d1b-4cd13215960d-0
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.852
Waterways and locks that the
boats go up and down to go

1c6a9370-7f07-4bf7-9d1b-4cd13215960d-1
00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:34.465
through the castle and we see
her in her boat having already

1c6a9370-7f07-4bf7-9d1b-4cd13215960d-2
00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:40.353
gone up one of the locks and on
a second level and going toward

1c6a9370-7f07-4bf7-9d1b-4cd13215960d-3
00:36:40.353 --> 00:36:43.850
another lock where she can
either go.

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-0
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.912
Well, it looks like she could go
either way, but there are men

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-1
00:36:49.912 --> 00:36:54.558
directing her and waving. If she
goes to the left, she would go

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-2
00:36:54.558 --> 00:36:58.768
to a forked waterway where
there's a boat coming from the

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-3
00:36:58.768 --> 00:37:03.268
left part of the for fork and
nothing to the right. She is up

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-4
00:37:03.268 --> 00:37:07.550
on the level of some of the
highest domes, and then if she

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-5
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:11.615
were to go through this lock
ahead of her and go to the

d1cad630-99dc-47d2-a13a-781bcd61f4d3-6
00:37:11.615 --> 00:37:15.389
right, she would have to go
down. But there's also.

c8f7d576-2caf-4f58-862f-d2d7e48de643-0
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.631
Someone coming in that waterway,
so if she goes straight, it's

c8f7d576-2caf-4f58-862f-d2d7e48de643-1
00:37:20.631 --> 00:37:25.456
clear. So it looks like she has
a choice of going left and

c8f7d576-2caf-4f58-862f-d2d7e48de643-2
00:37:25.456 --> 00:37:30.362
forking to the right. Or she
could go straight and we don't

c8f7d576-2caf-4f58-862f-d2d7e48de643-3
00:37:30.362 --> 00:37:35.269
know where she's going, but
she'll end up with another lock

c8f7d576-2caf-4f58-862f-d2d7e48de643-4
00:37:35.269 --> 00:37:40.257
that she'll need to go through.
So on the right side of this

c8f7d576-2caf-4f58-862f-d2d7e48de643-5
00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:43.609
direct waterway that she's
taking there.

a61412e4-7537-4100-9df1-8b69aad025ab-0
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.536
There is two different waterways
coming toward her, so she

a61412e4-7537-4100-9df1-8b69aad025ab-1
00:37:49.536 --> 00:37:54.401
couldn't go in either of those.
Then as she goes further, if she

a61412e4-7537-4100-9df1-8b69aad025ab-2
00:37:54.401 --> 00:37:59.191
goes straight, there is also one
that is like a waterfall where

a61412e4-7537-4100-9df1-8b69aad025ab-3
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:03.757
all the water is dumping out of
one of those into the bigger

a61412e4-7537-4100-9df1-8b69aad025ab-4
00:38:03.757 --> 00:38:08.472
waterway below. But she's pretty
far up right now and has some

a61412e4-7537-4100-9df1-8b69aad025ab-5
00:38:08.472 --> 00:38:09.670
choices to make.

3feaf9a7-b510-43d6-8d9a-f62660824b33-0
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.902
Yeah, OK, looks like she went
straight. And what we see here

3feaf9a7-b510-43d6-8d9a-f62660824b33-1
00:38:20.902 --> 00:38:26.431
is what happens as she goes
straight and there's people

3feaf9a7-b510-43d6-8d9a-f62660824b33-2
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:32.453
looks like they're yelling at
her from above because she has

3feaf9a7-b510-43d6-8d9a-f62660824b33-3
00:38:32.453 --> 00:38:36.600
taken the straight road and her
waterway.

04082da3-3d7e-4a37-a997-bbac3682d74a-0
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:43.813
Ends, and she would be right at
the edge in her red boat, ready

04082da3-3d7e-4a37-a997-bbac3682d74a-1
00:38:43.813 --> 00:38:49.535
to go down this waterfall, but
just kind of hanging over it.

04082da3-3d7e-4a37-a997-bbac3682d74a-2
00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:55.257
Below her are two other levels
of people in boats going both

04082da3-3d7e-4a37-a997-bbac3682d74a-3
00:38:55.257 --> 00:39:00.979
ways. Both of those appear to be
gondolas with people being.

a59672e0-97d2-4c2c-af62-1a773806abe6-0
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.773
Road I don't know what they call
a gondola pole by individuals

a59672e0-97d2-4c2c-af62-1a773806abe6-1
00:39:07.773 --> 00:39:12.706
who are standing up with poles
and above her is a is the tower

a59672e0-97d2-4c2c-af62-1a773806abe6-2
00:39:12.706 --> 00:39:17.326
where people are shouting at her
to the left of the tower.

a59672e0-97d2-4c2c-af62-1a773806abe6-3
00:39:17.326 --> 00:39:22.025
Interestingly enough, it looks
like there's a kite in a red

a59672e0-97d2-4c2c-af62-1a773806abe6-4
00:39:22.025 --> 00:39:26.410
kite in the air, and we saw that
red kite before in her

a59672e0-97d2-4c2c-af62-1a773806abe6-5
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.350
imagination.

5770b33f-484b-47ea-9bee-67d91b1617a6-0
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:33.599
To the left of her is the city
in the background and then on

5770b33f-484b-47ea-9bee-67d91b1617a6-1
00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:35.170
the right-hand page.

9799e614-2b79-4df6-8fd8-c9e732113ad0-0
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:43.044
We're back to a drawing that
doesn't have a background and it

9799e614-2b79-4df6-8fd8-c9e732113ad0-1
00:39:43.044 --> 00:39:48.546
appears that the boat has fallen
and she is in a free form,

9799e614-2b79-4df6-8fd8-c9e732113ad0-2
00:39:48.546 --> 00:39:54.323
falling in a circle that she is
making with her crayon. So you

9799e614-2b79-4df6-8fd8-c9e732113ad0-3
00:39:54.323 --> 00:39:59.916
see three pictures of her in
different tumbling positions as

9799e614-2b79-4df6-8fd8-c9e732113ad0-4
00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:05.784
she goes around this circle that
she's created. So she's in the

9799e614-2b79-4df6-8fd8-c9e732113ad0-5
00:40:05.784 --> 00:40:06.610
air, but.

a8d3b52e-0e13-42e3-aaf5-4a50efa502de-0
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:12.176
Uh hasn't fallen. She's doing a
circle in the air on this red

a8d3b52e-0e13-42e3-aaf5-4a50efa502de-1
00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:16.902
circle that she's drawing with
her crayon in her imagination,

a8d3b52e-0e13-42e3-aaf5-4a50efa502de-2
00:40:16.902 --> 00:40:19.569
and the boat is falling below
her.

f0b67ae5-df1b-4389-9332-ae70ee6db484-0
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.070
Well, as we turn the page.

be6e508c-b8e9-452a-97d3-8a23971c9d98-0
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.800
It looks like the circle that
she was making.

632a99c7-72c2-4cc9-93f0-a3405de084e8-0
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:38.494
Was creating a red hot air
balloon. And so now you see a

632a99c7-72c2-4cc9-93f0-a3405de084e8-1
00:40:38.494 --> 00:40:44.182
completed red hot air balloon
with a red basket and it looks

632a99c7-72c2-4cc9-93f0-a3405de084e8-2
00:40:44.182 --> 00:40:50.150
like she is in the basket waving
to the people on the tower who

632a99c7-72c2-4cc9-93f0-a3405de084e8-3
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:56.117
were alerting her of danger. And
she is still drawing and she's

632a99c7-72c2-4cc9-93f0-a3405de084e8-4
00:40:56.117 --> 00:41:02.178
drawing the lines that hold the
basket of the hot air balloon to

632a99c7-72c2-4cc9-93f0-a3405de084e8-5
00:41:02.178 --> 00:41:03.950
the balloon itself.

d858ec39-7ddd-4992-9d45-b6acc64229af-0
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.597
On the right hand side of the
page, because she's floating in

d858ec39-7ddd-4992-9d45-b6acc64229af-1
00:41:08.597 --> 00:41:12.854
the air on the left hand side
and you see clouds in just the

d858ec39-7ddd-4992-9d45-b6acc64229af-2
00:41:12.854 --> 00:41:17.320
top of the tower. On the right
hand side you see all the clouds

d858ec39-7ddd-4992-9d45-b6acc64229af-3
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:17.600
and.

ea598f65-63db-4e6e-860c-ced4a1743b43-0
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.880
Several things flying in the
air.

852b9e13-1fce-454e-a74c-6e5f6bb3872c-0
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.454
Looks like ohh gosh, what is the
name of that? A blimp and a

852b9e13-1fce-454e-a74c-6e5f6bb3872c-1
00:41:26.454 --> 00:41:30.819
flying machine of some sort. 2
blimps, maybe one further back

852b9e13-1fce-454e-a74c-6e5f6bb3872c-2
00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:35.465
and this flying machine like you
would see in a Leonardo da Vinci

852b9e13-1fce-454e-a74c-6e5f6bb3872c-3
00:41:35.465 --> 00:41:39.830
drawing of what could possibly
be a flying machine. But she's

852b9e13-1fce-454e-a74c-6e5f6bb3872c-4
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.280
up there in the clouds with all
of those things.

92daa6a9-ebcd-49e4-b5e0-b8147ea2d5de-0
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:52.100
And now as you turn the page,
you see that she continues to

92daa6a9-ebcd-49e4-b5e0-b8147ea2d5de-1
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:57.214
float upward. She has the
typical sandbags. Now that she's

92daa6a9-ebcd-49e4-b5e0-b8147ea2d5de-2
00:41:57.214 --> 00:42:02.588
drawn onto her hot air balloon
and she's not drawing anymore,

92daa6a9-ebcd-49e4-b5e0-b8147ea2d5de-3
00:42:02.588 --> 00:42:07.702
she's peering down. And around
her are two blimps and that

92daa6a9-ebcd-49e4-b5e0-b8147ea2d5de-4
00:42:07.702 --> 00:42:10.130
flying machine, which is so.

41f2602e-5246-4cb3-827f-5a2538101058-0
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.057
Intricate and old-fashioned and
interesting. And there is a

41f2602e-5246-4cb3-827f-5a2538101058-1
00:42:16.057 --> 00:42:20.020
bird. There was a bird in the
other picture. I couldn't tell

41f2602e-5246-4cb3-827f-5a2538101058-2
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.177
if it was a bird or a plane, but
it's purple. It's first purple

41f2602e-5246-4cb3-827f-5a2538101058-3
00:42:24.177 --> 00:42:28.010
that we've seen, and it's a
purple bird with a long plumed

41f2602e-5246-4cb3-827f-5a2538101058-4
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.529
tail in.

ca61ad0d-a7e6-4f6f-9859-4582eeb2e9c1-0
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.720
The two blimps are people.

e0b3ea4a-e3f6-468b-8823-5d5e0c2b5559-0
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.680
With.

d4be9827-7c37-4000-b61c-064eb3df7308-0
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.020
Nets and in the closer one you
can see.

82830499-f047-42c2-ad9f-3111e330d7ed-0
00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:45.712
That there is a cage in the
bottom and it appears that they

82830499-f047-42c2-ad9f-3111e330d7ed-1
00:42:45.712 --> 00:42:50.729
are taking that net and trying
to catch this plumed bird. There

82830499-f047-42c2-ad9f-3111e330d7ed-2
00:42:50.729 --> 00:42:54.099
are two people in the front of
this blimp.

99e539af-d449-481e-89d2-78e885e847ee-0
00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.399
Who are are the basket hanging
from the blimp and they're

99e539af-d449-481e-89d2-78e885e847ee-1
00:43:00.399 --> 00:43:05.872
holding the legs of the person
who is stretching out with the

99e539af-d449-481e-89d2-78e885e847ee-2
00:43:05.872 --> 00:43:11.257
net to catch the bird in the
back of it. It looks like there

99e539af-d449-481e-89d2-78e885e847ee-3
00:43:11.257 --> 00:43:12.140
is a king.

ad75dd2a-bde1-49ac-98e5-88e60b59d933-0
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.819
Directing those people, I can't
tell if he's pointing at them or

ad75dd2a-bde1-49ac-98e5-88e60b59d933-1
00:43:18.819 --> 00:43:20.070
if there's a gun.

aaf9aa58-9f9c-40d4-ba44-1ecff78a3d85-0
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:24.440
But it's interesting, and she's
watching this happen.

ffcde818-9583-4e39-9dd8-85ec6c94c5c6-0
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.819
OK, now we see that she has
moved in her hot air balloon

ffcde818-9583-4e39-9dd8-85ec6c94c5c6-1
00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:40.389
much closer to this intricate
flying machine, and we see great

ffcde818-9583-4e39-9dd8-85ec6c94c5c6-2
00:43:40.389 --> 00:43:45.428
detail on the flying machine in
the background. Before I

ffcde818-9583-4e39-9dd8-85ec6c94c5c6-3
00:43:45.428 --> 00:43:50.733
describe that in the background
is one of those blimps with

ffcde818-9583-4e39-9dd8-85ec6c94c5c6-4
00:43:50.733 --> 00:43:55.772
three people in a cage in it,
and we can't tell anything

ffcde818-9583-4e39-9dd8-85ec6c94c5c6-5
00:43:55.772 --> 00:43:56.480
further.

88f52c4a-0592-4bc2-bb47-a553a751df83-0
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.060
I don't see any purple bird.

fea8cf67-3a8e-4f52-9165-d2c8e048b70d-0
00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.730
But as she's gotten closer to
this flying machine in her red

fea8cf67-3a8e-4f52-9165-d2c8e048b70d-1
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:10.161
hot air balloon, the flying
machine is huge compared to her,

fea8cf67-3a8e-4f52-9165-d2c8e048b70d-2
00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:15.858
absolutely huge. And so you see
the detail, and it has two tall

fea8cf67-3a8e-4f52-9165-d2c8e048b70d-3
00:44:15.858 --> 00:44:20.309
smokestacks. The front looks
like the front of a.

bd21ae12-fc25-41d6-992d-f0a5293132ff-0
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.590
Big boat like an ocean liner.

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-0
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.153
It has looks like some steam
coming from various parts

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-1
00:44:30.153 --> 00:44:35.061
underneath and several gears up
on top and a boiler type looking

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-2
00:44:35.061 --> 00:44:39.818
thing that has two smokestacks
with smoke coming out of it and

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-3
00:44:39.818 --> 00:44:44.349
then something at the very
bottom below the smokestack that

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-4
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:49.182
looks like a paddle wheel but it
doesn't have a complete wheel,

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-5
00:44:49.182 --> 00:44:54.166
actually looks like the shape of
a spider web and there are three

ec6355c4-ff2b-4239-a22f-420047555c7a-6
00:44:54.166 --> 00:44:56.960
people on very top who are her
size.

be9eb41d-aaa1-4f04-b4be-5b1f4728ff2f-0
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.820
And they are um.

6df1a205-d2cb-4b49-ae81-073a6c7e41e0-0
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:04.200
Oh, I do see the purple bird.
They have received the Purple

6df1a205-d2cb-4b49-ae81-073a6c7e41e0-1
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.726
bird or caught it, and it is
small in this picture and in the

6df1a205-d2cb-4b49-ae81-073a6c7e41e0-2
00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:12.960
cage. And now it seems to me
that maybe the people on the

6df1a205-d2cb-4b49-ae81-073a6c7e41e0-3
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.048
blimp above have brought it
there. Either that or these

6df1a205-d2cb-4b49-ae81-073a6c7e41e0-4
00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.750
people caught their own purple
bird.

aef0a4ab-f373-4f50-bfc1-f6e1f735911a-0
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.878
And the this king person seems
to be there now, or at least

aef0a4ab-f373-4f50-bfc1-f6e1f735911a-1
00:45:25.878 --> 00:45:29.910
another king with those people.
So on this big.

725ad5b8-d084-4f49-9697-c0bf8b0d4ce8-0
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.720
A flying machine you have.

a0e2063d-afd3-43ba-bd86-d38f0c02107a-0
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:39.679
Three people at the top and
she's rather close to them and

a0e2063d-afd3-43ba-bd86-d38f0c02107a-1
00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:44.124
they have a cage with purple
bird in it. If you go toward the

a0e2063d-afd3-43ba-bd86-d38f0c02107a-2
00:45:44.124 --> 00:45:48.353
front of the flying machine,
there is a gold pedestal like

a0e2063d-afd3-43ba-bd86-d38f0c02107a-3
00:45:48.353 --> 00:45:52.654
thing with a gold bird on top
and then in the very front of

a0e2063d-afd3-43ba-bd86-d38f0c02107a-4
00:45:52.654 --> 00:45:52.870
it.

77d014a9-6b5f-4762-a62d-8c3b79e25f62-0
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.550
Stretched out.

47bdb340-08c8-4121-bf89-1883fe0136c2-0
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:02.900
At the bottom of the flying
machine is a long.

f746f2ab-c467-43f2-92b7-54e241503a5e-0
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.834
I can't tell what it is. It
looks like a ramp maybe, or a

f746f2ab-c467-43f2-92b7-54e241503a5e-1
00:46:08.834 --> 00:46:13.499
gear that goes to another small
platform out in front and up.

f746f2ab-c467-43f2-92b7-54e241503a5e-2
00:46:13.499 --> 00:46:18.240
Above in the background is the
other blimp that we saw before.

aadf2b49-674e-42fc-8c59-dc38fa242b0c-0
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:19.380
This is.

6e430581-77d7-49dd-9586-b094f23ea8bd-0
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.280
Alright, so as we turn the page.

60189b08-96a7-4244-b58e-eadedf21b8c7-0
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.537
This little adventuresome girl
has her crayon in her hand, and

60189b08-96a7-4244-b58e-eadedf21b8c7-1
00:46:31.537 --> 00:46:32.230
she has.

36130cb4-b0b3-4e9b-a202-c6decf8638d1-0
00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.584
Landed her hot air balloon,
apparently without the

36130cb4-b0b3-4e9b-a202-c6decf8638d1-1
00:46:37.584 --> 00:46:42.764
assistance of anyone else, which
is part of her imagination. And

36130cb4-b0b3-4e9b-a202-c6decf8638d1-2
00:46:42.764 --> 00:46:47.944
she has gotten out of it and is
now walking along a pathway or a

36130cb4-b0b3-4e9b-a202-c6decf8638d1-3
00:46:47.944 --> 00:46:53.124
walkway with a rail on it on the
big flying machine. And we only

36130cb4-b0b3-4e9b-a202-c6decf8638d1-4
00:46:53.124 --> 00:46:57.986
see a portion of the flying
machine because it's so huge and

36130cb4-b0b3-4e9b-a202-c6decf8638d1-5
00:46:57.986 --> 00:47:02.210
we're focusing on the girl, so
the other people are.

70374856-b63b-4d6d-aeb4-94dc1813f76c-0
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.370
Up above, she's heading toward
the first smokestack, and

70374856-b63b-4d6d-aeb4-94dc1813f76c-1
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.472
there's door in the bottom of
it, so she could go in,

70374856-b63b-4d6d-aeb4-94dc1813f76c-2
00:47:11.472 --> 00:47:12.840
apparently and as.

ebabb3ac-1baf-4768-a7e1-e70fff771b67-0
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:18.242
As you look at the two
smokestacks, there is a walkway

ebabb3ac-1baf-4768-a7e1-e70fff771b67-1
00:47:18.242 --> 00:47:23.172
bridged across them, and the
three people, including the king

ebabb3ac-1baf-4768-a7e1-e70fff771b67-2
00:47:23.172 --> 00:47:27.306
and the bird in a cage, are
walking into the second

ebabb3ac-1baf-4768-a7e1-e70fff771b67-3
00:47:27.306 --> 00:47:31.600
smokestack, where there's
another arched door on the.

7f549074-7d23-4921-a2e4-56c8dd08a788-0
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.081
Right side of the page you see a
close up of that gold pedestal

7f549074-7d23-4921-a2e4-56c8dd08a788-1
00:47:39.081 --> 00:47:45.340
that we saw before on the front
of the flying machine and it now

7f549074-7d23-4921-a2e4-56c8dd08a788-2
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:51.405
appears to have a pagoda shape
with the with the tile roof all

7f549074-7d23-4921-a2e4-56c8dd08a788-3
00:47:51.405 --> 00:47:57.567
in gold and the gold bird kind
of like with dragon wings on the

7f549074-7d23-4921-a2e4-56c8dd08a788-4
00:47:57.567 --> 00:48:00.360
very top of it in the middle.

0cd2533b-36d0-4cd0-b8e3-57629a56cc35-0
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:08.741
Is a platform that the purple
bird in the cage has now been

0cd2533b-36d0-4cd0-b8e3-57629a56cc35-1
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:09.620
placed.

6bf3d45f-71de-49e9-ae2d-edee3f910b39-0
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:17.150
In actually on a smaller
pedestal, um in that platform,

6bf3d45f-71de-49e9-ae2d-edee3f910b39-1
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:23.235
on that platform and there are
two armored people around it

6bf3d45f-71de-49e9-ae2d-edee3f910b39-2
00:48:23.235 --> 00:48:25.670
like it's being guarded.

b22c6906-05cb-4394-a7f9-194a9a5ef460-0
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:33.210
On the base of that platform,
which is on the larger gold

b22c6906-05cb-4394-a7f9-194a9a5ef460-1
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:39.733
pedestal, we see that there are
two ladders, one on the left and

b22c6906-05cb-4394-a7f9-194a9a5ef460-2
00:48:39.733 --> 00:48:45.453
one on the right, going down,
and the little girl is now

b22c6906-05cb-4394-a7f9-194a9a5ef460-3
00:48:45.453 --> 00:48:51.574
climbing up the ladder on the
left, almost to the top of the

b22c6906-05cb-4394-a7f9-194a9a5ef460-4
00:48:51.574 --> 00:48:55.889
platform, with her red crayon in
her hand.

51be122d-cfe4-4922-8547-2112a119a6f1-0
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:07.567
OK, the next action shows that
the little girl has taken the

51be122d-cfe4-4922-8547-2112a119a6f1-1
00:49:07.567 --> 00:49:13.957
purple bird in the cage off the
pedestal and is running to the

51be122d-cfe4-4922-8547-2112a119a6f1-2
00:49:13.957 --> 00:49:15.580
right with that.

c193ddb5-511a-45e0-9c7c-659b5c4dfe99-0
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.842
Cage in her hand and the two
guards are alarmed and one of

c193ddb5-511a-45e0-9c7c-659b5c4dfe99-1
00:49:21.842 --> 00:49:26.848
them has dropped his spear and
is jumping in the air, and

c193ddb5-511a-45e0-9c7c-659b5c4dfe99-2
00:49:26.848 --> 00:49:32.199
they're both looking frantic
because she has grabbed the bird

c193ddb5-511a-45e0-9c7c-659b5c4dfe99-3
00:49:32.199 --> 00:49:33.580
and is escaping.

265fd314-0d02-4712-9cd6-9d04fe2e3765-0
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:41.603
On the right hand, oh, that was
just a drawing. On the left hand

265fd314-0d02-4712-9cd6-9d04fe2e3765-1
00:49:41.603 --> 00:49:46.753
side, no background. On the
right hand side we now see a

265fd314-0d02-4712-9cd6-9d04fe2e3765-2
00:49:46.753 --> 00:49:52.627
very dark background, very dark
and the only thing bright in the

265fd314-0d02-4712-9cd6-9d04fe2e3765-3
00:49:52.627 --> 00:49:53.349
picture.

a8656b57-fac8-4a79-ba00-e70595e39147-0
00:49:54.740 --> 00:50:00.127
Well, let me, let me back up. So
the dark background is clouds,

a8656b57-fac8-4a79-ba00-e70595e39147-1
00:50:00.127 --> 00:50:05.430
so it's looks like it's night
time or they're saying that this

a8656b57-fac8-4a79-ba00-e70595e39147-2
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:10.817
was a frightening experience and
you see the front of the boat,

a8656b57-fac8-4a79-ba00-e70595e39147-3
00:50:10.817 --> 00:50:16.204
excuse me, of the machine that
has that appearance of the front

a8656b57-fac8-4a79-ba00-e70595e39147-4
00:50:16.204 --> 00:50:21.255
of a boat. You see it in a
cutaway so that you actually can

a8656b57-fac8-4a79-ba00-e70595e39147-5
00:50:21.255 --> 00:50:24.369
see levels in that with 1234
levels.

a578be23-0606-449d-a3f4-2394ac3d7e60-0
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:31.393
Lots of machinery and boiler
type things and 1234567 people

a578be23-0606-449d-a3f4-2394ac3d7e60-1
00:50:31.393 --> 00:50:36.540
that appear in shadow form. Oh
there's eight.

e789e131-1134-41e0-96f1-f7ebc9b13c32-0
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.145
In shadow form, silhouette
against a lighter sepia

e789e131-1134-41e0-96f1-f7ebc9b13c32-1
00:50:42.145 --> 00:50:47.497
background, they all appear to
have Spears in their hands, like

e789e131-1134-41e0-96f1-f7ebc9b13c32-2
00:50:47.497 --> 00:50:52.766
the men that we saw at the top
that were guarding the bird. So

e789e131-1134-41e0-96f1-f7ebc9b13c32-3
00:50:52.766 --> 00:50:57.784
they are in various stages of
action, doing various things,

e789e131-1134-41e0-96f1-f7ebc9b13c32-4
00:50:57.784 --> 00:51:02.969
and one is climbing up the top,
one is climbing up the ladder

e789e131-1134-41e0-96f1-f7ebc9b13c32-5
00:51:02.969 --> 00:51:07.819
toward the golden pedestal that
the bird had been on and.

031b14eb-d424-4140-b5a6-ef85f1790e6e-0
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.795
The golden pedestal is at the
top left of this page. As you

031b14eb-d424-4140-b5a6-ef85f1790e6e-1
00:51:14.795 --> 00:51:19.630
look at that cutaway, you also
see that when I had described

031b14eb-d424-4140-b5a6-ef85f1790e6e-2
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:24.702
before that there was a walkway
onto a smaller pedestal. Out in

031b14eb-d424-4140-b5a6-ef85f1790e6e-3
00:51:24.702 --> 00:51:29.220
the very front of the boat, you
see a silhouetted guard.

efb5aa13-57a0-4d14-afa9-4eae3c8fd07a-0
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:35.230
Um, going out onto that walkway
with two behind him still in the

efb5aa13-57a0-4d14-afa9-4eae3c8fd07a-1
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:40.104
boat, and at the end of that
walkway, sticking way out from

efb5aa13-57a0-4d14-afa9-4eae3c8fd07a-2
00:51:40.104 --> 00:51:43.759
the front of the flying machine,
is another.

d8672694-5091-490f-b2c7-877fbf70cc3f-0
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.600
Um.

d4524281-06bf-48e9-8411-a31459ae5914-0
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:53.350
Gosh, it's a platform with a
pretty bottom on it. It looks

d4524281-06bf-48e9-8411-a31459ae5914-1
00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:58.199
very fancy and you see the gold
cage that has the doors been

d4524281-06bf-48e9-8411-a31459ae5914-2
00:51:58.199 --> 00:52:02.651
opened. The girl is in front of
the gold cage and she's

d4524281-06bf-48e9-8411-a31459ae5914-3
00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:07.342
releasing the Purple Bird and
her red crayon is sitting on

d4524281-06bf-48e9-8411-a31459ae5914-4
00:52:07.342 --> 00:52:07.660
the.

51c416c4-d99c-4739-a6af-267cb8234493-0
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:12.700
Platform next to the cage.

801d92a9-4ea7-4199-bf73-8ae827bb1e5c-0
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.810
OK, next page.

54282d71-b283-4433-a7d7-a1d9cdbd253e-0
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:23.837
Well, the story continues. We
have a drawing and two of the

54282d71-b283-4433-a7d7-a1d9cdbd253e-1
00:52:23.837 --> 00:52:26.700
guards had the girl by the hand.

929895dc-e7b5-4c86-a070-5a074e48649a-0
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.400
Toward the back of of the.

86f1983c-7391-4489-ab77-86922d60bafe-0
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:37.805
Fancy pedestal, she the bird is
released and is not insight.

86f1983c-7391-4489-ab77-86922d60bafe-1
00:52:37.805 --> 00:52:43.268
They have grabbed her and are
dragging her apparently back to

86f1983c-7391-4489-ab77-86922d60bafe-2
00:52:43.268 --> 00:52:46.000
the flying machine. And she is.

c6bf85ea-c107-4f51-a9f5-727a1e5836b4-0
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:52.630
Resisting, she's leaning
forward. There is a guard in.

2c6e362c-34e9-4332-82fb-a262b19b1d1a-0
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:59.047
Oh, it looks like the king, or
what I had called the King

2c6e362c-34e9-4332-82fb-a262b19b1d1a-1
00:52:59.047 --> 00:53:05.042
because he is in gold and he has
that crown on his head and he is

2c6e362c-34e9-4332-82fb-a262b19b1d1a-2
00:53:05.042 --> 00:53:11.036
looking at her with his arm, his
right arm crooked in his hand on

2c6e362c-34e9-4332-82fb-a262b19b1d1a-3
00:53:11.036 --> 00:53:16.576
his hip. And the left arm is
pointing out like you've let go

2c6e362c-34e9-4332-82fb-a262b19b1d1a-4
00:53:16.576 --> 00:53:22.026
of my bird and someone has
released the red crayon and it's

2c6e362c-34e9-4332-82fb-a262b19b1d1a-5
00:53:22.026 --> 00:53:23.570
falling into the.

d768a347-7bc1-49b9-bba9-e7b699b93350-0
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.429
air I don't know if it got
knocked off or if it was thrown

d768a347-7bc1-49b9-bba9-e7b699b93350-1
00:53:28.429 --> 00:53:33.098
off. The Kings hand is open and
it's possible that he has

d768a347-7bc1-49b9-bba9-e7b699b93350-2
00:53:33.098 --> 00:53:37.928
dropped that purposefully, the
red crayon purposefully, and

d768a347-7bc1-49b9-bba9-e7b699b93350-3
00:53:37.928 --> 00:53:42.999
that he's not just pointing at
the bird on the right hand side

d768a347-7bc1-49b9-bba9-e7b699b93350-4
00:53:42.999 --> 00:53:46.299
of the page. We're in sepia
tones again.

9f5aa701-9e45-4a60-891b-79640f76fead-0
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.360
We're at the back.

14b8fcb2-fd9a-420b-83ef-2b533bc17349-0
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:54.790
It's not the back. We're at
another place on the.

4e87e9dc-589d-4c43-96f6-eea5715755a3-0
00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.330
Flying machine that actually is
about the middle of the bottom.

4e87e9dc-589d-4c43-96f6-eea5715755a3-1
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:04.617
If I remember correctly, it's
near the propeller and that

4e87e9dc-589d-4c43-96f6-eea5715755a3-2
00:54:04.617 --> 00:54:08.756
wheel that I described as a
water wheel, but it doesn't

4e87e9dc-589d-4c43-96f6-eea5715755a3-3
00:54:08.756 --> 00:54:11.270
really have edges to it.
There's.

676175f4-55fe-4135-9e51-6645e7e5f971-0
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.166
Smoke coming out of that water
wheel and between the water

676175f4-55fe-4135-9e51-6645e7e5f971-1
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:18.260
wheel and the.

b8dcf728-d3c5-42aa-bebf-2edb3d04c3e3-0
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:24.766
Propeller we now see that
there's another walkway and this

b8dcf728-d3c5-42aa-bebf-2edb3d04c3e3-1
00:54:24.766 --> 00:54:30.000
we we're getting a close up of
this and there is a gear.

e9a6ca32-a728-4993-9680-1c4ab29fd3b4-0
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:36.810
That is being moved by two of
those guard type people.

6370fa2e-eef4-4d69-b189-ed68032b21f8-0
00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:43.630
And it is lowering a cage, a
large cage.

2640f8db-fcc3-4d57-84aa-ea1f6050a46f-0
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:49.258
That is not gold. There's no
gold in this picture, it's all

2640f8db-fcc3-4d57-84aa-ea1f6050a46f-1
00:54:49.258 --> 00:54:53.792
sepia tones. But in that large
cage they have placed the girl

2640f8db-fcc3-4d57-84aa-ea1f6050a46f-2
00:54:53.792 --> 00:54:57.230
and she is leaning over the edge
looking down.

6a7f91de-0b4c-4bc0-9146-e162a20118db-0
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.680
Ha so now.

e75dbda1-68f6-478c-b94c-ba90489d6fbd-0
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.152
On the next page, we have a
background that's turned a bit

e75dbda1-68f6-478c-b94c-ba90489d6fbd-1
00:55:09.152 --> 00:55:13.832
reddish. We see a close up of
the girl in the cage, only none

e75dbda1-68f6-478c-b94c-ba90489d6fbd-2
00:55:13.832 --> 00:55:18.586
of the flying machine, but we
know that she's hanging from the

e75dbda1-68f6-478c-b94c-ba90489d6fbd-3
00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:22.964
flying machine and she is
jumping with her arms up in the

e75dbda1-68f6-478c-b94c-ba90489d6fbd-4
00:55:22.964 --> 00:55:27.417
air, like jumping for joy
because she sees the purple bird

e75dbda1-68f6-478c-b94c-ba90489d6fbd-5
00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:31.870
coming toward her and bringing
her red crayon in its beak.

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-0
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.729
Very exciting on the right hand
side. She is now back to the

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-1
00:55:37.729 --> 00:55:42.382
drawings. She is because there's
no background. We can only

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-2
00:55:42.382 --> 00:55:47.267
assume that she's sitting on the
floor of some sort in the top

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-3
00:55:47.267 --> 00:55:52.229
drawing, drawing a straight line
and the purple bird is perched

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-4
00:55:52.229 --> 00:55:57.269
on her shoulder as she's sitting
on the floor drawing a straight

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-5
00:55:57.269 --> 00:56:02.232
line or straight red line with
her red crayon. The next picture

260ae419-b3aa-4c9c-a0b8-aeed26b9dbc0-6
00:56:02.232 --> 00:56:02.929
the bird.

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-0
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.970
It's up in the air, flying over
her. She's leaning over, drawing

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-1
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:12.863
more of a part of the rectangle,
leaning on her arms to be very

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-2
00:56:12.863 --> 00:56:17.451
sure of what she's doing, and
the bottom one, she's drawing

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-3
00:56:17.451 --> 00:56:22.191
the other side of what appears
to be a rectangle. She's lying

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-4
00:56:22.191 --> 00:56:26.932
on her stomach with her, her
knees up in the air, very intent

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-5
00:56:26.932 --> 00:56:31.826
and very relaxed, and the bird
is in front of her now, standing

fda139b1-57ad-46d5-81ae-ba217a7e0de9-6
00:56:31.826 --> 00:56:32.820
and watching.

ed5810a3-0a64-4be9-a4ff-53b62614c94d-0
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:37.780
Wow.

a9169ae3-7a20-4a31-9ad4-1d78ca103f45-0
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:45.925
OK, so here the imagination
really kicks in. What she was

a9169ae3-7a20-4a31-9ad4-1d78ca103f45-1
00:56:45.925 --> 00:56:52.894
drawing apparently was a magic
carpet, and the magic carpet is

a9169ae3-7a20-4a31-9ad4-1d78ca103f45-2
00:56:52.894 --> 00:56:59.862
red and beautiful with tassels
on it. And she's already flying

a9169ae3-7a20-4a31-9ad4-1d78ca103f45-3
00:56:59.862 --> 00:57:04.729
in this next picture, so we see
her flying.

cea20eac-c1cd-41a3-b1eb-22cd092cb5ab-0
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:11.137
With the cage that held her on
the left side, this is a fully

cea20eac-c1cd-41a3-b1eb-22cd092cb5ab-1
00:57:11.137 --> 00:57:16.260
colored picture. You see behind
her the city with the castle

cea20eac-c1cd-41a3-b1eb-22cd092cb5ab-2
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:21.383
that she had been in, and in
front of her you see one of the

cea20eac-c1cd-41a3-b1eb-22cd092cb5ab-3
00:57:21.383 --> 00:57:26.843
tall turrets of that castle. And
the purple bird is flying quite

cea20eac-c1cd-41a3-b1eb-22cd092cb5ab-4
00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:32.386
a ways in front of her past that
turret, but she's heading toward

cea20eac-c1cd-41a3-b1eb-22cd092cb5ab-5
00:57:32.386 --> 00:57:35.830
it and appears to be following
the bird.

292b2f32-eb7b-4d4e-b854-eca9dc57c47e-0
00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:40.681
As the flying machine is above
her, but they are very much

292b2f32-eb7b-4d4e-b854-eca9dc57c47e-1
00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:45.500
closer to the city where the
castle is or the castle itself.

e9b2815d-2f8e-49ab-ac46-66c290faf754-0
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.670
The next picture is a double
page spread of.

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-0
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:59.199
Of night with lots of stars in a
purple sky and the silhouette of

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-1
00:57:59.199 --> 00:58:03.597
the castle on the left and the
girl on the magic carpet up

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-2
00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:08.367
above the castle, but past it,
it's still a red carpet. She now

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-3
00:58:08.367 --> 00:58:13.212
has a blue shirt on. We haven't
seen a blue shirt before. And on

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-4
00:58:13.212 --> 00:58:17.610
the other side of the page you
see the continuation of the

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-5
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.306
landscape with mountains, kind
of desert looking mountains and

eb2d23f7-548b-4fe4-8aa0-503ced93dd25-6
00:58:22.306 --> 00:58:24.169
a palm tree on the right.

3955771d-7c7d-4b98-865b-5d58921341e4-0
00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:28.460
And the purple bird is flying
down further.

5bc1105d-c350-45e5-9e20-057083cbbff5-0
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:34.539
To the ground than she is but
heading what appears to be in

5bc1105d-c350-45e5-9e20-057083cbbff5-1
00:58:34.539 --> 00:58:36.880
the direction of the palm tree.

c1e77afb-84d3-4ae6-a864-b68e382142f2-0
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:44.752
And yes, the bird was going to
the palm tree and is sitting now

c1e77afb-84d3-4ae6-a864-b68e382142f2-1
00:58:44.752 --> 00:58:49.226
at the bottom of the palm tree.
Everything's in a purple

c1e77afb-84d3-4ae6-a864-b68e382142f2-2
00:58:49.226 --> 00:58:52.130
background and the girl has in
this.

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-0
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.437
Uh, in this left side of the
picture, she has just gotten up

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-1
00:58:58.437 --> 00:59:02.576
from the magic carpet, which is
now on the ground. She has the

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-2
00:59:02.576 --> 00:59:06.715
red crayon in her hand, and her
shirt is still a bit blue, but

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-3
00:59:06.715 --> 00:59:10.722
she's heading toward the palm
tree where the bird is sitting

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-4
00:59:10.722 --> 00:59:14.598
next to the base of the palm
tree, where there is a purple

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-5
00:59:14.598 --> 00:59:18.737
door. So she's heading toward
that. On the right hand side, we

9bf30ef6-0dd4-400a-8ed2-595c2ce0c0bd-6
00:59:18.737 --> 00:59:20.840
have a series of drawings again.

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-0
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:27.205
Um, this time it has the black
purplish black background and

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-1
00:59:27.205 --> 00:59:31.554
the only colors basically are
white. The girl shirt is now

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-2
00:59:31.554 --> 00:59:36.050
white and when she opens the
door, the door is white. So the

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-3
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:40.841
first picture at the top she has
a crayon in her hand. She's got

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-4
00:59:40.841 --> 00:59:45.410
her hand on the door handle and
the bird is in the air flying

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-5
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.980
next to her when she opens the
door, inside the door is white

eedf2c8c-409f-4b12-b5f8-1e0e7cb75eda-6
00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.559
light. The bird is flying into
it.

3130afb6-05be-42b0-aed3-7d60b8061419-0
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:57.482
In the second picture, she is
holding the door open for the

3130afb6-05be-42b0-aed3-7d60b8061419-1
00:59:57.482 --> 01:00:02.415
bird, and in the third picture,
which is in a diagonal going

3130afb6-05be-42b0-aed3-7d60b8061419-2
01:00:02.415 --> 01:00:07.429
down the page, she is the bird
is no longer seen. It's in the

3130afb6-05be-42b0-aed3-7d60b8061419-3
01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:12.282
door and she is crawling into
the white space that the door

3130afb6-05be-42b0-aed3-7d60b8061419-4
01:00:12.282 --> 01:00:13.010
shows as.

4a9c7256-0582-4eed-b8f0-52203e794acb-0
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.200
As if she's following the bird.

17683af6-652f-4711-8192-e5cb7298ff5c-0
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:27.090
OK, so when she comes out the
other side of that door.

6c1a5593-d869-4873-8ade-bbbd56c736d9-0
01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.580
She still has the red crayon in
her hand and she is still

6c1a5593-d869-4873-8ade-bbbd56c736d9-1
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.236
crawling. And it turns out that
that door was the side of a

6c1a5593-d869-4873-8ade-bbbd56c736d9-2
01:00:37.236 --> 01:00:41.892
mailbox and she comes out the
arch side of a mailbox on the

6c1a5593-d869-4873-8ade-bbbd56c736d9-3
01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:46.160
same street that we started at.
Everything has a sepia

6c1a5593-d869-4873-8ade-bbbd56c736d9-4
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.661
background. She is right, the
mailboxes right next to the

6c1a5593-d869-4873-8ade-bbbd56c736d9-5
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:55.550
street light, which I did not
notice the mailbox there before.

d72a0b73-b1f3-4040-abf3-b305e672bed4-0
01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.921
And the traffic light is in
front of her. The same traffic

d72a0b73-b1f3-4040-abf3-b305e672bed4-1
01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:05.126
light before as we saw before,
but it now has the green light

d72a0b73-b1f3-4040-abf3-b305e672bed4-2
01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:09.127
on instead of the red light on.
And the boy there is a boy

d72a0b73-b1f3-4040-abf3-b305e672bed4-3
01:01:09.127 --> 01:01:09.670
running.

76769d63-b5f2-49e6-ba43-c0423fa07edb-0
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:16.635
Toward her. But actually it
appears that the bird is between

76769d63-b5f2-49e6-ba43-c0423fa07edb-1
01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:20.800
the girl at the mailbox flying
toward the boy.

97725d60-fe6d-41e9-a5e5-92281f5df4ae-0
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:28.910
Who is facing her? And the boy
has a purple crayon in his hand,

97725d60-fe6d-41e9-a5e5-92281f5df4ae-1
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:35.690
like that's his imagination. And
you still see the Sepia street

97725d60-fe6d-41e9-a5e5-92281f5df4ae-2
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.140
scene and the cutaway of the
underground.

72bcec6d-449a-4ad8-b99c-73f3d5af652f-0
01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:45.110
On the right side you see the
girl and boy.

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-0
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.967
It looks like they're holding
hands, touching hands, greeting

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-1
01:01:52.967 --> 01:01:57.723
each other, something like that.
There are three drawings. Again,

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-2
01:01:57.723 --> 01:02:02.191
no background, but the boy has
the purple bird perched on his

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-3
01:02:02.191 --> 01:02:06.082
hand, the girl, and he's
standing. The girl is on the

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-4
01:02:06.082 --> 01:02:10.261
left, still in 1/2 kneeling
position, and she has the red

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-5
01:02:10.261 --> 01:02:14.224
crayon in her left hand and
she's smiling. So the next

0ad52cb0-bcbe-47bf-98d9-6fcc0dfe7325-6
01:02:14.224 --> 01:02:18.260
picture going down because
there's three of them again.

79907706-faa8-4cff-ae7c-92c15e61d5ee-0
01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:19.990
Um, she has.

b03ceff6-7b61-4470-90a4-af3c0f93a561-0
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.608
Stood up is taking her red
crayon while the boy watches

b03ceff6-7b61-4470-90a4-af3c0f93a561-1
01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:29.004
with the with the purple crayon
in his hand and the bird perched

b03ceff6-7b61-4470-90a4-af3c0f93a561-2
01:02:29.004 --> 01:02:31.440
on his shoulder. She is taking
her.

f00edc6a-c5de-42a1-bc28-54b4db1db081-0
01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.000
Crayon and drawing a red circle.

1511fa32-a3a3-4131-b277-ff997da44333-0
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.893
Then the next picture down.
She's standing there next to her

1511fa32-a3a3-4131-b277-ff997da44333-1
01:02:41.893 --> 01:02:47.106
red circle with a red crayon in
her hand, and the boy is leaning

1511fa32-a3a3-4131-b277-ff997da44333-2
01:02:47.106 --> 01:02:51.839
over, drawing a purple circle
with his purple crayon still

1511fa32-a3a3-4131-b277-ff997da44333-3
01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:55.770
facing her, and the bird is
fluttering over him.

553325b2-0fee-4ab4-a9d0-d4bdf42ca744-0
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.503
So it looks like this might be
the last picture, but I don't

553325b2-0fee-4ab4-a9d0-d4bdf42ca744-1
01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:03.850
know.

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-0
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:10.705
Because they are friends and now
she has something to do because

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-1
01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:15.840
they have made a bicycle. So she
is on the front of the bicycle,

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-2
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.975
the purple wheel is in front of
her that he made. The red crayon

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-3
01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:25.715
is in her back pocket. She's
pointing forward like let's go

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-4
01:03:25.715 --> 01:03:30.692
do this. And he is on the back
of this two seat bicycle on top

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-5
01:03:30.692 --> 01:03:35.511
of the red wheel that she had
created with the purple crayon

f5fffdaa-d4f1-4dad-a1e4-73835f99e04e-6
01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.459
in his hand.

fe14cc19-6f3c-4465-86ea-482bd1e2284c-0
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:42.092
Pedaling furiously, and the
purple bird is behind them,

fe14cc19-6f3c-4465-86ea-482bd1e2284c-1
01:03:42.092 --> 01:03:42.780
flying.

281869da-f649-4773-bdcf-493f5024b2e3-0
01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:47.742
Looks like they're
off on an adventure and she

281869da-f649-4773-bdcf-493f5024b2e3-1
01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:51.403
found something to do. #END_journey Yeah, so
that was the story. How do you

281869da-f649-4773-bdcf-493f5024b2e3-2
01:03:51.403 --> 01:03:53.120
feel about telling the story?

b840f779-b1c8-4771-acba-03fbe48f9c01-0
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.210
I feel like.

802e9274-7bf7-451c-8f80-bb2a9ebdd766-0
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.674
The story was not hard to tell,
but without any indication of

802e9274-7bf7-451c-8f80-bb2a9ebdd766-1
01:04:11.674 --> 01:04:12.180
the.

9af0e747-2f13-458f-a0ed-916eee735c31-0
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.200
Title of the book.

7e5f125d-84c8-46dd-9e65-65631aafd47a-0
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:21.021
Uh, there was nothing to
indicate that it was an

7e5f125d-84c8-46dd-9e65-65631aafd47a-1
01:04:21.021 --> 01:04:26.614
adventure or an imagination or
anything like that. That would

7e5f125d-84c8-46dd-9e65-65631aafd47a-2
01:04:26.614 --> 01:04:31.667
have been helpful to know a
little bit more about where

7e5f125d-84c8-46dd-9e65-65631aafd47a-3
01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:37.621
we're going. Because normally if
you pick up a book for the first

7e5f125d-84c8-46dd-9e65-65631aafd47a-4
01:04:37.621 --> 01:04:41.050
time to read to a child or a
person.

9a44a345-6a6e-445b-a529-5aa5afa2a0cc-0
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.480
You do have an indication from
the cover. Are you OK? Do you

9a44a345-6a6e-445b-a529-5aa5afa2a0cc-1
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.470
need a break?

d217da8f-c8eb-4570-96bc-7485c48168b6-0
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:54.893
I'm good, OK, alright. So
moving on to the next one. So

d217da8f-c8eb-4570-96bc-7485c48168b6-1
01:04:54.893 --> 01:04:58.860
this one is just one page, a
complex scene.

a8fb499c-59d6-46c5-b375-9310d2032c86-0
01:04:59.650 --> 01:04:59.950
OK.

b4b8dafb-4437-4855-8cd0-cff57cc5be0a-0
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:07.141
And by describing this to
someone who is with me or not

b4b8dafb-4437-4855-8cd0-cff57cc5be0a-1
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:09.270
with me or can see this or not.

04ae23e9-92dd-4a73-ad97-d3e223acef08-0
01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.361
Cannot see this. They cannot
see this. OK, just like we did

04ae23e9-92dd-4a73-ad97-d3e223acef08-1
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:16.210
before, yes.

4a1ab753-66e5-443c-b281-3f4575d3074c-0
01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:17.900
Wow.

68588af4-3875-4aaf-ac07-bc4d68c18363-0
01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:23.808
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
OK. We are looking at a double

68588af4-3875-4aaf-ac07-bc4d68c18363-1
01:05:23.808 --> 01:05:28.280
page spread from a book that's
very detailed and up in the.

971926d6-fcd4-4389-8953-931e14e28f19-0
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:35.568
Top left corner there is ohh. I
don't remember what it's called

971926d6-fcd4-4389-8953-931e14e28f19-1
01:05:35.568 --> 01:05:41.630
but it's those little clapboards
that they use for movie sets.

971926d6-fcd4-4389-8953-931e14e28f19-2
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:47.404
Black and white and it says
dinosaurs, spacemen and ghouls.

971926d6-fcd4-4389-8953-931e14e28f19-3
01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:52.889
So I'm I'm looking at this
realizing I should be looking

971926d6-fcd4-4389-8953-931e14e28f19-4
01:05:52.889 --> 01:05:58.662
for dinosaurs, spacemen and
ghouls and they are around, but

971926d6-fcd4-4389-8953-931e14e28f19-5
01:05:58.662 --> 01:05:59.240
it is.

189f618b-1cdb-4813-b923-83d2e234be45-0
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.754
So complex and convoluted that
it's really hard to tell. So

189f618b-1cdb-4813-b923-83d2e234be45-1
01:06:04.754 --> 01:06:10.238
let's start with the fact that
it appears to be a movie set,

189f618b-1cdb-4813-b923-83d2e234be45-2
01:06:10.238 --> 01:06:15.811
and that is why the descriptor
is like that. From the top you

189f618b-1cdb-4813-b923-83d2e234be45-3
01:06:15.811 --> 01:06:17.610
see many, many many.

4e32a329-969d-488e-b94e-fe07e7671f8b-0
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:26.784
Lights that are like, uh, those
spotlights that they use in

4e32a329-969d-488e-b94e-fe07e7671f8b-1
01:06:26.784 --> 01:06:33.408
theaters. And so you see many,
many lights hanging from the

4e32a329-969d-488e-b94e-fe07e7671f8b-2
01:06:33.408 --> 01:06:36.500
ceiling and then there is a.

50b95556-799c-427b-a042-e5882904f362-0
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:43.644
Stage set, it's not on a stage.
It's like an outdoor movie set

50b95556-799c-427b-a042-e5882904f362-1
01:06:43.644 --> 01:06:49.568
with a structure around it
that's like wooden scaffolding

50b95556-799c-427b-a042-e5882904f362-2
01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:52.020
and people on top of it.

45f12209-8b0e-4808-b8b2-bfd0e14e8b24-0
01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:59.110
Working some of the things that
will be hanging down, including

45f12209-8b0e-4808-b8b2-bfd0e14e8b24-1
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:04.071
spaceman. So that is the
spaceman scene. I don't see

45f12209-8b0e-4808-b8b2-bfd0e14e8b24-2
01:07:04.071 --> 01:07:09.594
ghouls in that. I see all
spacemen. So it looks like we're

45f12209-8b0e-4808-b8b2-bfd0e14e8b24-3
01:07:09.594 --> 01:07:14.930
doing 3 different sets possibly.
And so this one is the.

62b339b7-4288-4fff-a4e7-273a78bd64d0-0
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:21.383
It's the most prominent. It's
not necessarily the largest, but

62b339b7-4288-4fff-a4e7-273a78bd64d0-1
01:07:21.383 --> 01:07:26.504
it's the most prominent. So you
see spaceships and around you

62b339b7-4288-4fff-a4e7-273a78bd64d0-2
01:07:26.504 --> 01:07:27.000
see a.

b05e74be-5f81-4267-99da-380f749c8913-0
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.780
Uh.

d7f37b13-510a-461a-a77a-10dfe7208bc1-0
01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:34.267
You see spaceships flying like
flying saucers. You see one that

d7f37b13-510a-461a-a77a-10dfe7208bc1-1
01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:35.140
looks like a.

dc1b3faf-a1c1-4328-8cfd-2d8f697d883b-0
01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:41.601
Cruise ship flying and you see
one that looks like a planet

dc1b3faf-a1c1-4328-8cfd-2d8f697d883b-1
01:07:41.601 --> 01:07:46.422
with someone sitting on the
rings like Saturn has, and then

dc1b3faf-a1c1-4328-8cfd-2d8f697d883b-2
01:07:46.422 --> 01:07:51.564
you see one of those spaceships
with the legs extended like you

dc1b3faf-a1c1-4328-8cfd-2d8f697d883b-3
01:07:51.564 --> 01:07:56.385
see on a lunar module. So it has
landed on this blue planet

dc1b3faf-a1c1-4328-8cfd-2d8f697d883b-4
01:07:56.385 --> 01:08:00.804
turquoise planet and next to
that is what I guess is a

dc1b3faf-a1c1-4328-8cfd-2d8f697d883b-5
01:08:00.804 --> 01:08:02.010
spaceship that.

70c2ffd5-e868-4441-b133-0eca53aa221e-0
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:08.142
I would say is upside down
because what looks like the

70c2ffd5-e868-4441-b133-0eca53aa221e-1
01:08:08.142 --> 01:08:13.574
landing gear for legs is at the
top, like it landed wrong. And

70c2ffd5-e868-4441-b133-0eca53aa221e-2
01:08:13.574 --> 01:08:18.748
yeah, and there's even stairs at
the top going in the wrong

70c2ffd5-e868-4441-b133-0eca53aa221e-3
01:08:18.748 --> 01:08:24.266
direction. So I would say this
one landed wrong and that's part

70c2ffd5-e868-4441-b133-0eca53aa221e-4
01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:25.560
of their story.

45a4da6c-4a65-49d1-b9a2-7c1e69326e03-0
01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:32.727
There are aliens that are green.
Interesting. And then you see

45a4da6c-4a65-49d1-b9a2-7c1e69326e03-1
01:08:32.727 --> 01:08:37.528
other. All the spacemen are in
orange and there some are

45a4da6c-4a65-49d1-b9a2-7c1e69326e03-2
01:08:37.528 --> 01:08:42.667
flying, some are running, some
are on this planet, this blue

45a4da6c-4a65-49d1-b9a2-7c1e69326e03-3
01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:47.553
planet. And then you see the
stagehands, the actual movie

45a4da6c-4a65-49d1-b9a2-7c1e69326e03-4
01:08:47.553 --> 01:08:52.860
set, people in normal clothes in
various places getting things

45a4da6c-4a65-49d1-b9a2-7c1e69326e03-5
01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.450
set up.

7d6ceff5-4f3f-49ff-b9c1-ac01c9f4b3f2-0
01:08:54.580 --> 01:09:01.412
Uh, moving to the left of that.
On the left side of the page is

7d6ceff5-4f3f-49ff-b9c1-ac01c9f4b3f2-1
01:09:01.412 --> 01:09:08.031
the dinosaur park. So you have,
oh, I would say, half a dozen

7d6ceff5-4f3f-49ff-b9c1-ac01c9f4b3f2-2
01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:13.690
big dinosaurs in various colors.
You have a volcano.

446c43ee-65de-4f5e-b106-e7bba50e9cf9-0
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:21.219
You have a lot of Cavemen, many,
many, many, many Cavemen doing

446c43ee-65de-4f5e-b106-e7bba50e9cf9-1
01:09:21.219 --> 01:09:23.960
all sorts of things in there.

d66f65c8-a1e6-4a2a-a621-d245fae22198-0
01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:30.571
Clothes made out of skins and
barefoot, like you would see in

d66f65c8-a1e6-4a2a-a621-d245fae22198-1
01:09:30.571 --> 01:09:35.872
the Flintstones and movie people
around them. A few in normal

d66f65c8-a1e6-4a2a-a621-d245fae22198-2
01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.780
clothes, mostly around the
edges.

c9db22fb-6a1c-46e7-9de2-54abf44702d3-0
01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.519
And then below that is what
looks like we're looking from

c9db22fb-6a1c-46e7-9de2-54abf44702d3-1
01:09:46.519 --> 01:09:53.039
above into the dressing room.
There's stars on the doors and

c9db22fb-6a1c-46e7-9de2-54abf44702d3-2
01:09:53.039 --> 01:10:00.093
lighted mirrors where people are
sitting, getting themselves make

c9db22fb-6a1c-46e7-9de2-54abf44702d3-3
01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:06.720
up and all of that. So that's
that dressing area and it looks

c9db22fb-6a1c-46e7-9de2-54abf44702d3-4
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.210
like there are spacemen in it.
Dinosaurs.

4e30806a-5f52-4165-aff3-e68806ea7349-0
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.160
Cavemen.

1f06da09-9eeb-42b2-9196-e72bab8cdf6d-0
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.580
Aliens.

75b5ce4d-6238-498d-bcc0-c21c4037d224-0
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.152
So it's oh, and then there's
ghouls. And I haven't gotten to

75b5ce4d-6238-498d-bcc0-c21c4037d224-1
01:10:21.152 --> 01:10:22.590
that part yet, so.

0b83fd56-cb78-48fe-ba68-12d1d559ca0f-0
01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:30.945
Let me give you some detail here
of spacing. So the top has on

0b83fd56-cb78-48fe-ba68-12d1d559ca0f-1
01:10:30.945 --> 01:10:36.857
the left the caveman area and
then on the right the spaceman

0b83fd56-cb78-48fe-ba68-12d1d559ca0f-2
01:10:36.857 --> 01:10:42.770
area and then below the spaceman
in the bottom right corner.

82b8988e-785d-41e2-8d1d-2c4d08fe8d2b-0
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:46.890
It appears that there is
another.

e0122d0f-0073-47c2-9123-9e857d0b82b9-0
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.970
Uh.

72350f99-7105-4581-ac9e-462ebfd3aea2-0
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:56.315
Another area where they are
working on the movie details. So

72350f99-7105-4581-ac9e-462ebfd3aea2-1
01:10:56.315 --> 01:11:02.395
the two bottom corners have
actual movie details. You have

72350f99-7105-4581-ac9e-462ebfd3aea2-2
01:11:02.395 --> 01:11:08.887
three sets, the dinosaurs on the
top left, the spaceman on the

72350f99-7105-4581-ac9e-462ebfd3aea2-3
01:11:08.887 --> 01:11:14.863
top right and in the middle
bottom. Between the two movie

72350f99-7105-4581-ac9e-462ebfd3aea2-4
01:11:14.863 --> 01:11:17.440
staging areas is another.

e85b26b6-ae7c-428e-8c7c-bbf16ea40e4f-0
01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.960
Another set, and it looks like
there's a haunted house.

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-0
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:30.491
Some interesting things. There 1

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-1
01:11:30.491 --> 01:11:34.890
looks like a big ice cream cone
in the middle. I don't know what

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-2
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:39.220
that is. You don't see too many
ghouls there. Most of the ghouls

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-3
01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:43.348
I guess are still getting ready,
or there's not very many in

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-4
01:11:43.348 --> 01:11:47.070
them, but you see a lot of
people staging and a lot of

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-5
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:50.995
lights up close. So this is more
in a preliminary area of

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-6
01:11:50.995 --> 01:11:54.920
readiness than the others.
There's not a lot of the stage

16cf857f-cd96-4573-925c-c609eca89370-7
01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.800
people on it. #END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls

9a5bebbf-2a60-4cae-bf78-7040f43b8af9-0
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:59.310
OK, so that was about 5
minutes. We are good.

30a0d32f-c7cc-421b-9b76-b4643e53fd62-0
01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.450
Goodness gracious.

49248908-b10a-45fc-828a-dd6d41b1c5d8-0
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:08.578
What? That's crazy. It's. Yeah.
It's just, yeah, it's totally OK

49248908-b10a-45fc-828a-dd6d41b1c5d8-1
01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:13.440
to not talk about everything. I
like that. You sort of.

f1e92a83-a059-45a6-9718-5091996d685d-0
01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.925
Big picture, just these are the
things people here and then

f1e92a83-a059-45a6-9718-5091996d685d-1
01:12:18.925 --> 01:12:22.420
yeah, I think that's that's a
good way to do that, yeah.

e2f173c8-813a-4837-86c3-94b293a2dbcd-0
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:24.350
OK.

fd9c8b38-55b7-44bc-ae0e-c7631c56207b-0
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.800
So this is a story about 8 pages
we can.

9fb23cd9-fc2c-4935-af58-eff616fd5da7-0
01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:33.858
Thank you. We just talked about
it might be more helpful to

9fb23cd9-fc2c-4935-af58-eff616fd5da7-1
01:12:33.858 --> 01:12:37.248
think about it as someone
sitting next to you and you're

9fb23cd9-fc2c-4935-af58-eff616fd5da7-2
01:12:37.248 --> 01:12:40.698
telling the story. I will do
that. Yeah, that will be the

9fb23cd9-fc2c-4935-af58-eff616fd5da7-3
01:12:40.698 --> 01:12:43.910
last one. This will be the last
one we do today. OK.

3f1d784e-b72d-4249-9db0-cbefc2560a3c-0
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:57.170
OK. Wow.

26bfd060-ff0a-4040-9ccd-0036c21dd06a-0
01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:00.420
#START_arrival_4 Well, as we
look at this book.

743ae11c-9d58-468a-86cf-69d56f95a1eb-0
01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:06.040
We can see that there's a lot of
things that we have to.

4ed5ace3-be39-48f6-af64-c285b602964e-0
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.050
Have to figure out.

11e771f2-1e40-424d-b0fd-716b42604363-0
01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:14.690
So we're going to start with top
left and realize that.

0c1b719a-e88b-4594-a37c-a3228ed27c4a-0
01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:20.870
There is a man here who is just
kind of getting ready for his

0c1b719a-e88b-4594-a37c-a3228ed27c4a-1
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:25.619
day. So there's all these
pictures. And if we start at the

0c1b719a-e88b-4594-a37c-a3228ed27c4a-2
01:13:25.619 --> 01:13:30.449
left and go to the right at the
top and then go to the next

0c1b719a-e88b-4594-a37c-a3228ed27c4a-3
01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:35.118
level like we do when we read,
we will say, OK, the man's

0c1b719a-e88b-4594-a37c-a3228ed27c4a-4
01:13:35.118 --> 01:13:39.786
getting up, he's shaving, he's
putting on his clothes and

0c1b719a-e88b-4594-a37c-a3228ed27c4a-5
01:13:39.786 --> 01:13:43.570
buttoning his vest. He's putting
on his shoes.

54a352b0-8ff9-4c9c-af67-e43e091aed0f-0
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:49.493
Looks like he's getting a wallet
or money or tickets and then

54a352b0-8ff9-4c9c-af67-e43e091aed0f-1
01:13:49.493 --> 01:13:53.963
he's grabbing his hat like he's
going to be ready to go out.

54a352b0-8ff9-4c9c-af67-e43e091aed0f-2
01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:54.550
This is.

5a6f420a-a464-4798-a5db-48339a128ef9-0
01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.879
Going somewhere and the next one
you realize, oh, he's getting a

5a6f420a-a464-4798-a5db-48339a128ef9-1
01:14:01.879 --> 01:14:06.344
map, so he has to find out where
he's going, and then he's

5a6f420a-a464-4798-a5db-48339a128ef9-2
01:14:06.344 --> 01:14:10.582
holding the map, and then you
see further out that he's

5a6f420a-a464-4798-a5db-48339a128ef9-3
01:14:10.582 --> 01:14:15.350
holding the map and he's going
to read it. The bottom picture.

6648d3ed-d018-4009-95d8-04a6d64b6e04-0
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.992
I can't tell if he still has the
map in his hand or if he's

6648d3ed-d018-4009-95d8-04a6d64b6e04-1
01:14:21.992 --> 01:14:25.922
dropped it. I don't think he's
dropped it. I think he's on the

6648d3ed-d018-4009-95d8-04a6d64b6e04-2
01:14:25.922 --> 01:14:29.602
street now, starting on his
trip. And so you see a picture

6648d3ed-d018-4009-95d8-04a6d64b6e04-3
01:14:29.602 --> 01:14:29.789
of.

5e6d224c-9e75-4931-81d4-e69f772bfb8f-0
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:36.703
Where he's headed and it's a
curved roadway, so then we go up

5e6d224c-9e75-4931-81d4-e69f772bfb8f-1
01:14:36.703 --> 01:14:41.950
to the top of the next and he's
checking the map. So he didn't

5e6d224c-9e75-4931-81d4-e69f772bfb8f-2
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:43.449
he didn't drop it.

db9ee4b5-b8aa-428b-9e72-54f17ec7ea48-0
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.582
It has a foreign words up at the
top, so we don't know what it

db9ee4b5-b8aa-428b-9e72-54f17ec7ea48-1
01:14:49.582 --> 01:14:54.440
says, but he's looking at it and
studying it in those top three

db9ee4b5-b8aa-428b-9e72-54f17ec7ea48-2
01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.223
pictures and then down at the
bottom you see where he is. He's

db9ee4b5-b8aa-428b-9e72-54f17ec7ea48-3
01:14:59.223 --> 01:15:03.474
in front of one of those tipi
looking things and it's a

db9ee4b5-b8aa-428b-9e72-54f17ec7ea48-4
01:15:03.474 --> 01:15:05.600
strange looking environment.

8978fc40-08ee-46ca-be91-5a356d774ad1-0
01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.271
But there's lots of them, so
let's turn the page and see what

8978fc40-08ee-46ca-be91-5a356d774ad1-1
01:15:11.271 --> 01:15:11.670
happens.

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-0
01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:18.564
Ohh, there's some creatures
talking. And then you see that

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-1
01:15:18.564 --> 01:15:22.993
the creatures are talking of on
the ground right where he's

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-2
01:15:22.993 --> 01:15:27.495
standing looking at his map, and
he sees someone else and is

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-3
01:15:27.495 --> 01:15:31.776
asking in the next picture,
probably for help. Because we

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-4
01:15:31.776 --> 01:15:36.131
see that this lady, or it
appears to be a lady, is looking

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-5
01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:40.707
at the map with him, pointing
out some things and then giving

e4915294-223f-4fd5-ae8a-3caf4278f2e7-6
01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:42.110
him an explanation.

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-0
01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:48.461
Of how he can get further help.
So showing him this machine that

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-1
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:53.232
in the next picture looks like a
dial phone and a crank. So he's

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-2
01:15:53.232 --> 01:15:57.563
getting something from that
machine that she's helped him.

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-3
01:15:57.563 --> 01:16:02.261
It looks like a ticket. So down
at the bottom she's showing him

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-4
01:16:02.261 --> 01:16:06.886
the ticket, explaining it, and
then giving him the ticket. And

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-5
01:16:06.886 --> 01:16:11.216
I can't tell what that next
picture is. Maybe he's I can't

80b1b945-fb24-4f7a-bd73-0ed44d0a6ba2-6
01:16:11.216 --> 01:16:14.300
tell what that is. Maybe he's
paying her.

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-0
01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:19.641
Anyway, on the right hand side
you see all this stuff going on

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-1
01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:24.713
in the sky, and possibly that's
the kind of thing that he wants

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-2
01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:29.150
to see. She and he are on the
right hand side and she's

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-3
01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:33.746
pointing to this. So the next
few pictures show that he's

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-4
01:16:33.746 --> 01:16:38.421
going underneath that like a
sailing machine that seems to

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-5
01:16:38.421 --> 01:16:43.492
have landed. And so he's going
to be in line, looks like, to go

1450e4f5-78b8-43fe-817d-4c9e32b562b8-6
01:16:43.492 --> 01:16:44.760
on that machine.

87426296-90f2-4d5d-99a3-2866fd1eb81f-0
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:49.065
And this little critter is down
there next to him, and then he

87426296-90f2-4d5d-99a3-2866fd1eb81f-1
01:16:49.065 --> 01:16:53.075
turns in the ticket and the man
gives him the direction to go

87426296-90f2-4d5d-99a3-2866fd1eb81f-2
01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:53.270
in.

7843f467-70ea-4d79-8ab2-be28dd50535c-0
01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:58.820
So once he's in and this little
critter is sitting next to him.

e0310d44-5b3d-40b8-bfa8-87c733409dd0-0
01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.354
Looks like that same lady is
there, and so maybe she was

e0310d44-5b3d-40b8-bfa8-87c733409dd0-1
01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:09.024
going in that direction. And
there's a lot of people in this,

e0310d44-5b3d-40b8-bfa8-87c733409dd0-2
01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:13.544
so they're having a conversation
and he must be looking for

e0310d44-5b3d-40b8-bfa8-87c733409dd0-3
01:17:13.544 --> 01:17:17.914
someone because he pulls
something out of his pocket that

e0310d44-5b3d-40b8-bfa8-87c733409dd0-4
01:17:17.914 --> 01:17:22.434
looks like, how do I find this
person? I'm looking for this

e0310d44-5b3d-40b8-bfa8-87c733409dd0-5
01:17:22.434 --> 01:17:23.790
person and so she.

de67a337-9882-46bb-80d8-f629214d30ad-0
01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:29.763
Puts her hand on her chest like
ohh my I know exactly what

de67a337-9882-46bb-80d8-f629214d30ad-1
01:17:29.763 --> 01:17:33.520
you're doing. Reaches into her
bag and pulls out.

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-0
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:40.234
The same thing, yeah. I mean, we
can't see his up close, but we

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-1
01:17:40.234 --> 01:17:45.128
can see hers. And that's the
picture of what appears to be a

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-2
01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:50.182
younger girl. So as we go to the
next page, it looks like that

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-3
01:17:50.182 --> 01:17:55.317
younger girl has had something
happen to her. She was reading a

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-4
01:17:55.317 --> 01:18:00.211
book, she was taken. Somebody
took her book and put it away,

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-5
01:18:00.211 --> 01:18:05.426
unlocked something, put a shovel
in her hand and pointed to what

2730004b-02f7-4922-a3ce-0d83257368a4-6
01:18:05.426 --> 01:18:06.710
she needs to do.

4185147e-3cdf-4dc5-8b0d-959e4e874b6b-0
01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:12.716
Is to do this work where he
placed her. So she's shoveling

4185147e-3cdf-4dc5-8b0d-959e4e874b6b-1
01:18:12.716 --> 01:18:18.483
something looks like into a
furnace, maybe coal, and just

4185147e-3cdf-4dc5-8b0d-959e4e874b6b-2
01:18:18.483 --> 01:18:22.560
keeps doing that and then at the
bottom.

52f084ba-45ec-4b7a-9d69-5cdbff804097-0
01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:30.388
It looks like there's smoke
coming out of that and she's

52f084ba-45ec-4b7a-9d69-5cdbff804097-1
01:18:30.388 --> 01:18:32.900
trying to shield herself from
it, so.

3859016d-9c8d-48da-ac1e-5e6e1d1869e4-0
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.535
Uh, yeah, it shouldn't be
smoking. And so in the middle

3859016d-9c8d-48da-ac1e-5e6e1d1869e4-1
01:18:37.535 --> 01:18:41.962
picture, uh, we get a little bit
more information. She's bringing

3859016d-9c8d-48da-ac1e-5e6e1d1869e4-2
01:18:41.962 --> 01:18:46.120
up this big brush and going to
the top of the chimney of that

3859016d-9c8d-48da-ac1e-5e6e1d1869e4-3
01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.010
furnace and it looks like she's
cleaning out the chimney.

330c196c-d8c6-4fcf-9ab0-13704a78f337-0
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:59.120
So she is in a place where
there's lots of these furnaces

330c196c-d8c6-4fcf-9ab0-13704a78f337-1
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.417
and she's cleaning out the
chimney and it looks like a

330c196c-d8c6-4fcf-9ab0-13704a78f337-2
01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:07.869
never ending job. So on the
right hand side you see that

330c196c-d8c6-4fcf-9ab0-13704a78f337-3
01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:10.760
she's not happy. She's leaning
over.

cccb3c56-19e8-499d-a813-d71bcdcf58cf-0
01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:13.660
And she sees.

3e7d99d7-f17b-42c0-ad71-95d21ab707cb-0
01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:20.080
A door. Maybe it's the door of
the room that she's in, and she

3e7d99d7-f17b-42c0-ad71-95d21ab707cb-1
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:25.119
takes her shovel and tries to
use the shovel to get out of

3e7d99d7-f17b-42c0-ad71-95d21ab707cb-2
01:19:25.119 --> 01:19:28.450
that door, so looks like she
gets out.

1e6c2d6e-4ec6-43e0-967a-5035123bfafc-0
01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:36.141
Finds her book in that drawer
and takes her book and runs away

1e6c2d6e-4ec6-43e0-967a-5035123bfafc-1
01:19:36.141 --> 01:19:40.230
and goes to where there are some
houses.

69cf9859-095d-45f5-92ba-543e415643b2-0
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:46.665
But it's train tracks. If we
look down below, we see a train.

69cf9859-095d-45f5-92ba-543e415643b2-1
01:19:46.665 --> 01:19:51.151
So maybe those houses are next
to the train track or are the ed

69cf9859-095d-45f5-92ba-543e415643b2-2
01:19:51.151 --> 01:19:55.146
ends of trains. And so she
climbs in. Yeah, looks like a

69cf9859-095d-45f5-92ba-543e415643b2-3
01:19:55.146 --> 01:19:59.632
boxcar, like she's trying to get
away in that train. And so she

69cf9859-095d-45f5-92ba-543e415643b2-4
01:19:59.632 --> 01:20:03.977
now sitting in the train with
her book with her and the train

69cf9859-095d-45f5-92ba-543e415643b2-5
01:20:03.977 --> 01:20:05.730
takes off with her in it.

37d99a7c-c525-45fa-a07e-1f461d7f4126-0
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:15.303
So now we're back to where this
man and the lady are in this

37d99a7c-c525-45fa-a07e-1f461d7f4126-1
01:20:15.303 --> 01:20:20.441
city, in this flying machine,
and they are sitting next to

37d99a7c-c525-45fa-a07e-1f461d7f4126-2
01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:25.493
each other looking out the
window and the ladies pointing

37d99a7c-c525-45fa-a07e-1f461d7f4126-3
01:20:25.493 --> 01:20:30.719
and she sees someone who's
giving a message. And so the the

37d99a7c-c525-45fa-a07e-1f461d7f4126-4
01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:36.294
flying machine that looks like a
boat is landing. He thanks the

37d99a7c-c525-45fa-a07e-1f461d7f4126-5
01:20:36.294 --> 01:20:38.820
lady and this little critter.

3cae1dcc-f869-4433-99c2-9b8a85e1a41b-0
01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.140
Walks out. As he does. He looks
up.

9300dbc3-63b4-4452-8cbd-591aec6d44fc-0
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:49.510
Not knowing what he's doing for
sure, but then you see what he's

9300dbc3-63b4-4452-8cbd-591aec6d44fc-1
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:51.630
seeing and it is this.

11036099-b7f5-4431-8474-148a7beec358-0
01:20:54.620 --> 01:21:00.418
Maybe a statue with the smoke
coming out of it in this city

11036099-b7f5-4431-8474-148a7beec358-1
01:21:00.418 --> 01:21:06.506
and people are around him that
have those hats on like the man

11036099-b7f5-4431-8474-148a7beec358-2
01:21:06.506 --> 01:21:07.570
did in the.

64f95e7d-5831-4479-9915-3d3de1c836d6-0
01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:13.740
When he got onto the ship and so
he's looking over the city scene

64f95e7d-5831-4479-9915-3d3de1c836d6-1
01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.714
and it looks like that little
animal is next to him because

64f95e7d-5831-4479-9915-3d3de1c836d6-2
01:21:17.714 --> 01:21:18.840
you see the tail.

1e163ab6-e2df-4eed-b01f-86fe9cd1318e-0
01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:23.976
Let's see what happens. So he's
still walking along, trying to

1e163ab6-e2df-4eed-b01f-86fe9cd1318e-1
01:21:23.976 --> 01:21:28.240
find his way, walking along in
the city, and that little animal

1e163ab6-e2df-4eed-b01f-86fe9cd1318e-2
01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.503
is next to him. He sees people
talking with all these tentacles

1e163ab6-e2df-4eed-b01f-86fe9cd1318e-3
01:21:32.503 --> 01:21:36.633
around them. He goes to no, he
sees someone at a ticket place

1e163ab6-e2df-4eed-b01f-86fe9cd1318e-4
01:21:36.633 --> 01:21:40.697
getting a ticket and people
talking. It's like a carnival in

1e163ab6-e2df-4eed-b01f-86fe9cd1318e-5
01:21:40.697 --> 01:21:41.429
my opinion.

c0402fe6-8a8a-4c10-871f-d9579b66fa12-0
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:44.330
He.

c02cbf27-61a7-4ca9-8506-d110414dc87a-0
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:50.059
He sees someone talking to
another little critter and

c02cbf27-61a7-4ca9-8506-d110414dc87a-1
01:21:50.059 --> 01:21:55.926
smiling. Lots of people around.
So he has in this book in his

c02cbf27-61a7-4ca9-8506-d110414dc87a-2
01:21:55.926 --> 01:21:57.630
hand a picture of.

b2944c1b-a6aa-4d22-8934-528675dccb4b-0
01:21:59.270 --> 01:22:04.744
I'm going to say that's like,
Umm, it's a a book that has

b2944c1b-a6aa-4d22-8934-528675dccb4b-1
01:22:04.744 --> 01:22:07.010
pictures when you can't.

178367e6-411d-4c74-9ede-d403d0d074e0-0
01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.139
Speak the same language, and so
he wants bread, and so he is

178367e6-411d-4c74-9ede-d403d0d074e0-1
01:22:13.139 --> 01:22:17.646
going to this place and this
little critter is showing him

178367e6-411d-4c74-9ede-d403d0d074e0-2
01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:18.410
something.

e0501077-0ced-4da5-b760-08d1f5b31e63-0
01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:24.755
Like he's gonna help him. And so
he opens the drawer that the

e0501077-0ced-4da5-b760-08d1f5b31e63-1
01:22:24.755 --> 01:22:29.604
critter is showing him and
there's something in the drawer

e0501077-0ced-4da5-b760-08d1f5b31e63-2
01:22:29.604 --> 01:22:30.920
that looks like.

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-0
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:37.134
I don't know. It looks like the
critter, but it's probably not.

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-1
01:22:37.134 --> 01:22:41.277
It's something with a little
tail on it, but it looks like

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-2
01:22:41.277 --> 01:22:45.561
it's not an animal. And so he
looks in his book and he takes

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-3
01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:49.915
one of those and he goes and
finds someone who or gives it to

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-4
01:22:49.915 --> 01:22:54.339
him and everybody's happy. So he
gives it to this boy. And the

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-5
01:22:54.339 --> 01:22:58.552
boy is with an older man, might
be his dad, and they want a

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-6
01:22:58.552 --> 01:23:03.187
picture of it because it's cool.
And so they went to give it back

4b8c194d-cbbf-4114-9c7d-7511869d810c-7
01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:03.960
to the man.

6612d0af-7727-464d-aedd-ba22f92237f8-0
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:09.523
And the man says, no, this is
what I'm looking for and I need

6612d0af-7727-464d-aedd-ba22f92237f8-1
01:23:09.523 --> 01:23:15.016
help. And so the father figure
points to this place where you

6612d0af-7727-464d-aedd-ba22f92237f8-2
01:23:15.016 --> 01:23:20.687
should be able to get something
that you want, and he goes into

6612d0af-7727-464d-aedd-ba22f92237f8-3
01:23:20.687 --> 01:23:25.383
it and pulls out this other
thing that looks like an

6612d0af-7727-464d-aedd-ba22f92237f8-4
01:23:25.383 --> 01:23:28.749
eggplant and gives it to the man
and.

a1e1d3c3-e924-432e-8148-bc91eea87446-0
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:35.206
Explains something to him and
the boy brings a basket for the

a1e1d3c3-e924-432e-8148-bc91eea87446-1
01:23:35.206 --> 01:23:39.877
man to carry that in. And so
they're helping him and they're

a1e1d3c3-e924-432e-8148-bc91eea87446-2
01:23:39.877 --> 01:23:40.260
he's.

0ba62bea-811b-46cc-bf01-a251287b5f2e-0
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.702
He's obviously in a good place
where people are helping him and

0ba62bea-811b-46cc-bf01-a251287b5f2e-1
01:23:45.702 --> 01:23:49.463
he's ready to go do something
next. So then you have the

0ba62bea-811b-46cc-bf01-a251287b5f2e-2
01:23:49.463 --> 01:23:53.290
father showing him something
else and the boy showing him

0ba62bea-811b-46cc-bf01-a251287b5f2e-3
01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:54.279
something else.

515f4840-9421-44c9-ae56-8f7b3c546066-0
01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:55.760
And.

eff30094-93ab-4e42-a383-45995b62023d-0
01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.845
I can't tell what the father's
doing. It looks like he's

eff30094-93ab-4e42-a383-45995b62023d-1
01:23:59.845 --> 01:24:02.470
eating, so maybe this is food. I
don't know.

866501ad-e09a-4791-93e6-afa929207ad7-0
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:08.086
But it's interesting. And the
boy brings this big thing over

866501ad-e09a-4791-93e6-afa929207ad7-1
01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:11.680
that also looks like food. And
then the father has.

20fa4296-cce3-4fe0-8ba3-448997651a21-0
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:19.663
Some little pocket like thing
that has something in it that

20fa4296-cce3-4fe0-8ba3-448997651a21-1
01:24:19.663 --> 01:24:20.940
now appears to be.

1b9829a5-132b-482c-a792-e6a09ab91a58-0
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:27.896
A snake like thing and he's
explaining all this stuff to him

1b9829a5-132b-482c-a792-e6a09ab91a58-1
01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:32.980
and they keep showing him
different things and the boy.

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-0
01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:37.551
Shows him that he can eat it. So
the man takes a bite of

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-1
01:24:37.551 --> 01:24:41.643
something that he's not familiar
with and he knows he's OK. So

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-2
01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:45.475
then the boy shows him that the
animal can eat it too, the

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-3
01:24:45.475 --> 01:24:49.501
little critter. And the father
walks away. I mean, excuse me,

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-4
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:53.073
the man walks away with all
these things that he's not

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-5
01:24:53.073 --> 01:24:56.905
familiar with, but they've
explained to him that are OK to

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-6
01:24:56.905 --> 01:25:01.127
take. And so the boys whispering
to his dad, telling him what he

102eefb8-bf5c-41e7-817a-0e30d44acfee-7
01:25:01.127 --> 01:25:03.660
thinks they should do to help
the man.

5c3716c9-1d93-4999-a512-a14a03989187-0
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:07.941
And the father shows the man,
hey, I've got a basket and

5c3716c9-1d93-4999-a512-a14a03989187-1
01:25:07.941 --> 01:25:11.983
you've got a basket and the boy
has a basket. So let's go

5c3716c9-1d93-4999-a512-a14a03989187-2
01:25:11.983 --> 01:25:16.234
together. And they go to this
place where there looks like a

5c3716c9-1d93-4999-a512-a14a03989187-3
01:25:16.234 --> 01:25:17.140
lot of boats.

629fd751-dbb3-4e48-9f8b-ad47990a3a7b-0
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:21.180
Ohh.

51ba2071-d631-44d4-9941-fd216ddb5e92-0
01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:30.636
So the boy in the in the critter
approached this boat with a big

51ba2071-d631-44d4-9941-fd216ddb5e92-1
01:25:30.636 --> 01:25:34.680
pot on it, and the boy goes over
and.

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-0
01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:41.176
Tells the man to come over here
and then there's this critter

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-1
01:25:41.176 --> 01:25:45.612
coming out of the pot and they
are not familiar with it. I mean

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-2
01:25:45.612 --> 01:25:49.770
he is not familiar with it and
is a bit alarmed and I think

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-3
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.997
he's dropping his basket and the
boy is kind of covering his

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-4
01:25:53.997 --> 01:25:58.155
mouth like Oh no, it's really
OK. And the father comes over

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-5
01:25:58.155 --> 01:26:02.729
and explains to the man it's OK.
And the boy picks up this animal

90d999f3-d410-4324-b396-6c9ca6bbb42f-6
01:26:02.729 --> 01:26:05.710
that was in the pot like it's
his pet and.

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-0
01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.051
Introduces him to the man, and
the father is pointing and

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-1
01:26:10.051 --> 01:26:14.798
saying, look there, that the two
critters are gonna make friends.

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-2
01:26:14.798 --> 01:26:19.114
So they're both looking at each
other and they're fine. The

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-3
01:26:19.114 --> 01:26:23.645
critters are. And so the father
is helping the man pick up his

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-4
01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:28.248
things from the basket that he
had dropped. And then the father

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-5
01:26:28.248 --> 01:26:32.851
explains more to him and the man
is asking another question and

9f89ccba-ab33-4fc5-b67d-9d91e54ccf92-6
01:26:32.851 --> 01:26:36.520
going back to his book saying
this is what I need.

d209013e-6faf-436e-9b98-10b6f95e4be1-0
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:41.091
Help with and he shows them what
looks like houses. And so the

d209013e-6faf-436e-9b98-10b6f95e4be1-1
01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:44.450
father puts his hand on his
shoulder and says.

492d8f11-b146-4154-a540-f5ad94c6c60a-0
01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:52.659
That he is going to explain
whatever he can about it and you

492d8f11-b146-4154-a540-f5ad94c6c60a-1
01:26:52.659 --> 01:26:53.840
see the father.

0f995bd1-844d-431d-9f7e-be1f65ed713c-0
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:58.646
