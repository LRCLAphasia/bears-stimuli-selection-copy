00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.550
Please.

0461256f-6887-4517-941f-7f6f2ec66883-0
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.717
Alright, so in this study you
will see two types of pictures.

0461256f-6887-4517-941f-7f6f2ec66883-1
00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:11.797
This first type we call it
graphic novels. They are series

0461256f-6887-4517-941f-7f6f2ec66883-2
00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:16.155
of pictures that tell a story.
Imagine that you're telling the

0461256f-6887-4517-941f-7f6f2ec66883-3
00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:20.374
story that someone who cannot
see the pictures describe what

0461256f-6887-4517-941f-7f6f2ec66883-4
00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:24.040
you see and what is happening as
you go through it.

d2edd0f8-5949-4c92-8373-e26e80b91dbf-0
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.540
So usually we aim for 10 to 15
minutes for each one.

8c2dde0e-8068-4bf1-b113-56a25913d9a1-0
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.270
And the first one, the this
graphic novel has 8 pages.

40df7dd3-f072-48f5-a8d2-3119d8b59ba7-0
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.900
And you can start when you're
ready.

5230934b-1afd-4435-89d1-95a211967efc-0
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.680
So I just described what's
going on in the pictures.

ce2a2d89-3f2e-42a3-a028-f49c03475f80-0
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.414
#START_arrival_4 Top left looks
like somebody showering and

ce2a2d89-3f2e-42a3-a028-f49c03475f80-1
00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:54.810
shaving and getting dressed and
tying their shoes.

7e000e65-1ed4-4987-b433-78e4617f5009-0
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.340
Look like they're counting money
in their hand.

138e301e-a6ad-4b41-adfe-edaa69113bed-0
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.900
Getting a hat to put on.

b113da50-0f60-4f22-9a0c-05e8e27f6948-0
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.280
And looks like they're looking
at a map and.

ee62432e-c28a-4cd2-92c6-97523fc5eea8-0
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.546
The man standing there with it
looks like a fish out of it at

ee62432e-c28a-4cd2-92c6-97523fc5eea8-1
00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:08.960
his feet.

7bd88c04-2277-47b5-bc47-1073c37804cc-0
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120
And then there's a picture of
him walking on the sidewalk.

ad145f16-09b7-405f-8cb6-95aea942dc7f-0
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.943
Some kind of little fish type
creature behind him. And then

ad145f16-09b7-405f-8cb6-95aea942dc7f-1
00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:21.151
there's a cities scape with
streets and buildings and

ad145f16-09b7-405f-8cb6-95aea942dc7f-2
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.537
there's some smoke coming out of
the some of the factory

ad145f16-09b7-405f-8cb6-95aea942dc7f-3
00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:27.804
buildings looks like the top,
right again there's more

ad145f16-09b7-405f-8cb6-95aea942dc7f-4
00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:31.189
pictures of the map and the
person's looking at the map.

7624d9cb-7a22-48ff-b90e-62709204a533-0
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.626
And again, pictures of him
looking at the map, reading it

7624d9cb-7a22-48ff-b90e-62709204a533-1
00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:38.280
with that little fish type thing
at his feet.

5c9a5291-d677-4284-bfe3-db15251a35ec-0
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230
And then the big picture at the
bottom.

1c094031-ed23-49f1-9087-df4fd1acbaf3-0
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.750
Looks like it's.

e962a9b4-15ea-4a08-883f-4ab36c92bb11-0
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.287
bunch of people on the ground,
they have these like cone type

e962a9b4-15ea-4a08-883f-4ab36c92bb11-1
00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:52.922
things behind them with holes in
it and then there is a big

e962a9b4-15ea-4a08-883f-4ab36c92bb11-2
00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:56.679
bridge with archways underneath
it and there's ships that are

e962a9b4-15ea-4a08-883f-4ab36c92bb11-3
00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.073
going under the bridge and
there's big ones and they're

e962a9b4-15ea-4a08-883f-4ab36c92bb11-4
00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:00.740
small ones.

7a58d9f3-39dd-4afe-9b16-577da9e55b78-0
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.130
OK.

23dffb2a-edc1-4826-ba55-b496fd65a8ab-0
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.520
OK, so there's these two little
creatures in the top left.

bf768ae5-3bcd-4a09-9c24-4efd13d60439-0
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.472
Sounds like a bird type thing
one's, like a fish type thing

bf768ae5-3bcd-4a09-9c24-4efd13d60439-1
00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:15.040
with the tail.

cb123bc7-e88c-4b19-b3cf-7545ca2f1aa3-0
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.593
And then there's a man and a
woman. They're both reading and

cb123bc7-e88c-4b19-b3cf-7545ca2f1aa3-1
00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:21.298
they're standing on the street
with the two creatures of

cb123bc7-e88c-4b19-b3cf-7545ca2f1aa3-2
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:24.191
between them and the on the
ground, and then looks like he's

cb123bc7-e88c-4b19-b3cf-7545ca2f1aa3-3
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:27.038
talking to her. He has like a
folded pamphlet in his hands.

cb123bc7-e88c-4b19-b3cf-7545ca2f1aa3-4
00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:27.750
She has a book.

5e3d0455-d359-4b5f-9113-abad5ad1e8e1-0
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.078
And then maybe that's like a
map, because it looks like in

5e3d0455-d359-4b5f-9113-abad5ad1e8e1-1
00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:35.448
the next row pictures she's
pointing to something on his

5e3d0455-d359-4b5f-9113-abad5ad1e8e1-2
00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:39.291
pamphlet. And then you can see a
picture of it looks almost like

5e3d0455-d359-4b5f-9113-abad5ad1e8e1-3
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.779
a I don't know if it be a map,
but it's some kind of weird

5e3d0455-d359-4b5f-9113-abad5ad1e8e1-4
00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.326
paper that's different shapes
and stuff on it. And then the

5e3d0455-d359-4b5f-9113-abad5ad1e8e1-5
00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.460
next picture she's pointing to
some kind of machine.

b5b5f10d-c3d7-40ed-934a-2d8d5637c21a-0
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.975
And it has a dial on it. Maybe
it's like a phone. And then she

b5b5f10d-c3d7-40ed-934a-2d8d5637c21a-1
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:57.410
shows that she's spinning the
dial almost like a Rotary phone.

b5b5f10d-c3d7-40ed-934a-2d8d5637c21a-2
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.681
And then there's like a lever
she pulls and something comes

b5b5f10d-c3d7-40ed-934a-2d8d5637c21a-3
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.190
out. So I don't know if it's a
money or what.

3ccb574e-b8b4-4b65-a117-1910919178f2-0
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.453
And then there's a picture of
her pointing to that and then he

3ccb574e-b8b4-4b65-a117-1910919178f2-1
00:03:08.453 --> 00:03:12.430
she's handing it to him and then
she has almost like a.

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-0
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.886
Little timepiece like pocket
watches and she's pointing to

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-1
00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:19.839
him. And then the top right
there's a bunch of people

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-2
00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.121
looking at the sky, but in the
sky there's a bunch of those

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-3
00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:26.402
like weird looking ships that
are different sizes. And then

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-4
00:03:26.402 --> 00:03:29.902
there's a couple other pictures
of people from different angles

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-5
00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:32.801
of on the ground looking up.
There's a bridge in the

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-6
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:36.246
background of one of them. And
then there's ships a little bit

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-7
00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.364
up up close, and the next
picture and then the next one,

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-8
00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:42.864
they're standing there, it just
shows another angle. Looks like

50540bf5-b3d0-46d6-ba34-80e5f0f31bab-9
00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:43.630
almost like a.

67317a2e-3f29-4dde-8694-cd94f3b2ba3e-0
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.020
Like a circle type building with
like factory chimneys.

ad1c9f23-93c5-4291-8142-8b00dbfaa529-0
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.975
And then at the bottom there is
a guy who is the pamphlet in his

ad1c9f23-93c5-4291-8142-8b00dbfaa529-1
00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.980
hand and there's a fish thing on
the ground.

7a4c606a-946a-4b28-a1a7-98889a7c2536-0
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.020
And there's a couple woman's
footsteps in front of him. Shoot

7a4c606a-946a-4b28-a1a7-98889a7c2536-1
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.196
feet in front of him, and then
he has whatever little piece of

7a4c606a-946a-4b28-a1a7-98889a7c2536-2
00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.920
paper and someone else is.

33639e21-e72e-43da-919b-d21ee43fabf1-0
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.929
I don't know. Most like ticket
punching, like punching the

33639e21-e72e-43da-919b-d21ee43fabf1-1
00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.444
ticket. And then there's a
picture of a guy with

33639e21-e72e-43da-919b-d21ee43fabf1-2
00:04:11.444 --> 00:04:13.550
interesting uniform on and some
glasses.

985bfcff-9862-4fc2-a1e7-60c1d6045b11-0
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.670
OK.

7be32ddc-8b24-4953-aedf-bed76574dcff-0
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.666
OK, so on the top left there's a
weird fish animal again getting

7be32ddc-8b24-4953-aedf-bed76574dcff-1
00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:26.110
onto a bench, and there's a guy
also sitting on a bench.

764c8be3-2900-4962-8d0d-0091a2a32372-0
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.451
And the next picture is him
sitting there with the little

764c8be3-2900-4962-8d0d-0091a2a32372-1
00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:32.423
fish thing. There's a woman next
to him with a little bird thing,

764c8be3-2900-4962-8d0d-0091a2a32372-2
00:04:32.423 --> 00:04:35.079
and then there's some other
people around. It's a bunch of

764c8be3-2900-4962-8d0d-0091a2a32372-3
00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:35.800
rows of benches.

6f62dd29-8795-4c1e-b012-63db382d1dd7-0
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.090
And then he's talking to her.
She still has that bird thing on

6f62dd29-8795-4c1e-b012-63db382d1dd7-1
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.520
her lap.

aad8117c-2931-4ff5-990c-136e3957481a-0
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.652
And then he's using different
gestures and he reaches into his

aad8117c-2931-4ff5-990c-136e3957481a-1
00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:47.960
pocket and pulls out a piece of
paper with a picture on it.

30569888-9a23-4b1c-b8fe-ece50a3a1fbc-0
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.080
And then she used the gesture
like with her hand on her heart,

30569888-9a23-4b1c-b8fe-ece50a3a1fbc-1
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.134
on her chest, and then she
reaches into her pocket or into

30569888-9a23-4b1c-b8fe-ece50a3a1fbc-2
00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:57.930
her purse and find pulls out a
piece of paper with a.

b9492cc6-e40c-43dd-aae4-36def6dd9f7c-0
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.805
Another picture on it and it
shows a more up close. She was

b9492cc6-e40c-43dd-aae4-36def6dd9f7c-1
00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:04.550
an idea like a little girl.

e443a825-31ba-4fb6-a656-1abe99b09cf6-0
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.100
And then it's a closer picture
of that little girl.

d56a9e12-bb13-4092-b9c5-3a8a83be7e0e-0
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.363
And then on the right side,
there's a girl reading a book

d56a9e12-bb13-4092-b9c5-3a8a83be7e0e-1
00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:16.734
and then looks like somebody's
trying to take the book off of

d56a9e12-bb13-4092-b9c5-3a8a83be7e0e-2
00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:19.887
her, and then they put it into a
drawer and then it shows

d56a9e12-bb13-4092-b9c5-3a8a83be7e0e-3
00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:22.660
somebody's being there's
something's being locked.

caf2cf92-9393-4447-8027-3835da148ff6-0
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.074
Maybe the doors being locked and
then somebody's putting a shovel

caf2cf92-9393-4447-8027-3835da148ff6-1
00:05:27.074 --> 00:05:30.062
in her hand and then she's
standing there sad with the

caf2cf92-9393-4447-8027-3835da148ff6-2
00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:33.212
shovel and there's somebody
bigger behind her holding her

caf2cf92-9393-4447-8027-3835da148ff6-3
00:05:33.212 --> 00:05:36.797
shoulder. And then she uses that
shovel to put something into it.

caf2cf92-9393-4447-8027-3835da148ff6-4
00:05:36.797 --> 00:05:39.730
Looks like a incinerate like
incineration type thing.

e1171418-8d0f-4a66-b18e-1bb27ab7bc31-0
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.360
And and then she's, you see,
you're still standing there.

ee2d6533-ce0e-477f-8214-632552e460a9-0
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.053
And putting things into there.
And then you see her climbing up

ee2d6533-ce0e-477f-8214-632552e460a9-1
00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:49.580
a ladder.

8edd4a18-90cf-42c7-bcd9-9eccfb41ba37-0
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.601
And like cleaning out the
chimney with like one of the

8edd4a18-90cf-42c7-bcd9-9eccfb41ba37-1
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:53.150
chimney sweeps.

a9ed8e32-73c7-4ab4-ad3a-de91093a9d36-0
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.728
So then it's like a bigger
picture of her at the top of the

a9ed8e32-73c7-4ab4-ad3a-de91093a9d36-1
00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:01.170
ladder.

63aaa80b-c65c-4646-bec0-82e2be59525d-0
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.497
The chimney sweep brush and the
chimney and then around her.

63aaa80b-c65c-4646-bec0-82e2be59525d-1
00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:08.436
It's almost like a picture from
further back. You can see a

63aaa80b-c65c-4646-bec0-82e2be59525d-2
00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:11.276
bunch of the same situations
happening, a bunch of people

63aaa80b-c65c-4646-bec0-82e2be59525d-3
00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:14.068
standing in front of these
incinerators with the chimney

63aaa80b-c65c-4646-bec0-82e2be59525d-4
00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:14.460
smoking.

88e2aae5-a7f9-433b-84cb-3a02e326170c-0
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.129
And then the top right there's a
girl, I'm assuming the same

88e2aae5-a7f9-433b-84cb-3a02e326170c-1
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.289
girl. She's sad, sitting there,
cross legged, her head in her

88e2aae5-a7f9-433b-84cb-3a02e326170c-2
00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.296
hands. And then there's a
picture of her holding a shovel,

88e2aae5-a7f9-433b-84cb-3a02e326170c-3
00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:28.405
looking at the door, and then
she's trying to use the shovel

88e2aae5-a7f9-433b-84cb-3a02e326170c-4
00:06:28.405 --> 00:06:29.169
to open a door.

bbcce23d-976e-4e32-90f1-c315669375d5-0
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.943
She's at the edge of the door
with the door. Looks like it's

bbcce23d-976e-4e32-90f1-c315669375d5-1
00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:34.770
cracked open now.

18abb99c-1045-4d9c-a16d-c0c643844437-0
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.270
And then she tries to get into
she has the key, she tries to

18abb99c-1045-4d9c-a16d-c0c643844437-1
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.164
get into the drawer, she gets
her book, and then it shows her

18abb99c-1045-4d9c-a16d-c0c643844437-2
00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:44.860
walking away with the book.

1650ef50-5762-49a5-a8ed-02b67ab79b8f-0
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.460
And.

e4a27cea-b5e6-4f6b-9e6e-b0a8d4629ea6-0
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.363
Looks like she's just trying to
get on to a train, then there's

e4a27cea-b5e6-4f6b-9e6e-b0a8d4629ea6-1
00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:54.872
next to train tracks and then
she gets on to like a train car

e4a27cea-b5e6-4f6b-9e6e-b0a8d4629ea6-2
00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:58.609
and she's sitting there with her
book and then it shows the train

e4a27cea-b5e6-4f6b-9e6e-b0a8d4629ea6-3
00:06:58.609 --> 00:07:01.270
going around a like a bend with
a train track.

bf218960-2bc8-444d-835d-c0de7a0d5803-0
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.680
And then, um, top left, there's
like a.

a04dd1fd-314a-40a4-b754-447da4296093-0
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.718
Almost like a Times Square type
thing. Looks like there's like a

a04dd1fd-314a-40a4-b754-447da4296093-1
00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:12.920
city.

d1b1175f-6758-4242-83b2-48959daa4b63-0
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.116
Area with a bunch of billboards
and different language, and

d1b1175f-6758-4242-83b2-48959daa4b63-1
00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:20.127
there's a woman crying cup of
coffee on the billboards.

d1b1175f-6758-4242-83b2-48959daa4b63-2
00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:23.568
There's a weird ship type thing
with that chimney on it and was

d1b1175f-6758-4242-83b2-48959daa4b63-3
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.020
like, there's people on it.

50e8db4f-9e34-4db1-b27f-c167348ad22e-0
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.100
And then below that there's.

d60c1271-2d56-4384-aa79-286f76f28790-0
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.274
Up close of a man and a woman
sitting there. She has a weird

d60c1271-2d56-4384-aa79-286f76f28790-1
00:07:32.274 --> 00:07:35.730
bird thing on her lap, and then
there's a guy with a megaphone.

b62b285e-c12d-447c-848e-9c47db0f2239-0
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.919
And then there's a closer up
picture of some people standing

b62b285e-c12d-447c-848e-9c47db0f2239-1
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:42.530
with one of those type shift
things in front of them.

e6751731-2419-4707-ab36-86cef6a9d4ba-0
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.415
And then there's a picture of
the woman sitting there with the

e6751731-2419-4707-ab36-86cef6a9d4ba-1
00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:49.174
bird thing in her hand, and
there's a guy shakes her hand.

e6751731-2419-4707-ab36-86cef6a9d4ba-2
00:07:49.174 --> 00:07:52.026
He looks like he's leaving and
he has a little fish thing at

e6751731-2419-4707-ab36-86cef6a9d4ba-3
00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:54.925
his feet. And then he's had his
head in his hands, looks like

e6751731-2419-4707-ab36-86cef6a9d4ba-4
00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:55.580
he's thinking.

8928f2f3-d630-4136-90c9-64947b734b7e-0
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.600
And then the next on the right
side, there's a big picture of.

3d3e34d1-ae86-4e0a-be10-87f2ab76e721-0
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.400
Guy looks like he's standing in
the city area where there's a

3d3e34d1-ae86-4e0a-be10-87f2ab76e721-1
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.372
couple of stairs in front of
him, the windy sidewalks around

3d3e34d1-ae86-4e0a-be10-87f2ab76e721-2
00:08:07.372 --> 00:08:09.370
them. There's some other people
walking.

aa973f59-df28-4915-99c3-044271e617e0-0
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.793
they have some interesting hats
on pointy and then there's some

aa973f59-df28-4915-99c3-044271e617e0-1
00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:17.676
buildings on the right and then
you can see almost like a little

aa973f59-df28-4915-99c3-044271e617e0-2
00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:19.230
bit of a valley, but it's.

f1843749-5cea-4519-8afe-e6b41e04141f-0
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.153
Like a circle area where there's
some people or trees around and

f1843749-5cea-4519-8afe-e6b41e04141f-1
00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:26.310
then there's some really weird
shapes.

907d7c6a-5789-4f48-af05-ca668ed092c4-0
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.969
Creature that looks like it's
holding a bowl with other little

907d7c6a-5789-4f48-af05-ca668ed092c4-1
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.941
things in it and there's some
vases and stuff at the vase of

907d7c6a-5789-4f48-af05-ca668ed092c4-2
00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:35.890
that and it's a really big like
statue.

cc8f7a6e-2ea1-453f-8880-3b766892f013-0
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.666
Uh, top left. There's a guy
walking with the little fish

cc8f7a6e-2ea1-453f-8880-3b766892f013-1
00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:46.634
thing on the sidewalk with
building behind them. And then

cc8f7a6e-2ea1-453f-8880-3b766892f013-2
00:08:46.634 --> 00:08:49.500
there's a broader picture of the
building. More people.

023935c6-dd55-4aea-aecb-db0a535afff9-0
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.320
More little animals.

0ad8e9f0-8f47-4b0f-9a4e-4885a0375d68-0
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.590
And then this picture of bottom,
I mean not bottom left, but the

0ad8e9f0-8f47-4b0f-9a4e-4885a0375d68-1
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.803
next row left is 2 guys talking
with looks like almost like

0ad8e9f0-8f47-4b0f-9a4e-4885a0375d68-2
00:08:59.803 --> 00:09:03.015
little eels or a little tails
coming out of boxes. And then

0ad8e9f0-8f47-4b0f-9a4e-4885a0375d68-3
00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:05.799
there's a woman who's putting
something into a box.

6f3233b2-d04f-4eb1-9181-a810b35209d7-0
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.332
And a wall of like almost makes
me think of like, PO boxes. And

6f3233b2-d04f-4eb1-9181-a810b35209d7-1
00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:13.554
then there's a guy and a woman
and she, the woman holding a box

6f3233b2-d04f-4eb1-9181-a810b35209d7-2
00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:16.827
with the little fish in it. He's
looking at it. And then there's

6f3233b2-d04f-4eb1-9181-a810b35209d7-3
00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.999
people again that spanned out
picture of people walking on the

6f3233b2-d04f-4eb1-9181-a810b35209d7-4
00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:21.459
sidewalk with little animals.

3e1ea51b-43c7-4f32-861b-ee563288676f-0
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.852
And then somebody's pointing to
a a booklet and it has some

3e1ea51b-43c7-4f32-861b-ee563288676f-1
00:09:26.852 --> 00:09:31.360
pictures of fruit like milk,
cheese, bread, fish, potato.

03fb15a7-c024-434f-8f14-a73d25cdad61-0
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.390
And then a guy sitting somewhere
with that in his hand.

4d662e59-2efe-4cff-9f7f-f03246276a08-0
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.210
And there's a wall behind him
and there's that little fish

4d662e59-2efe-4cff-9f7f-f03246276a08-1
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.260
thing looking at the wall.

9b87bfa8-86ba-43ad-8b19-0a987da43130-0
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.793
Looks like he puts the fish
thing in one of the drawers in

9b87bfa8-86ba-43ad-8b19-0a987da43130-1
00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.570
the wall and he's looking at a
book.

b9110f85-a0cc-44ab-b45f-286d03e7cd95-0
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.844
And then somebody reaches into
the drawer with a little fish

b9110f85-a0cc-44ab-b45f-286d03e7cd95-1
00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:51.220
things.

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-0
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.450
And he saw his book in his hand.
He's talking to a little boy who

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-1
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.688
has a little fish thing in his
hand. And then there's a picture

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-2
00:09:58.688 --> 00:10:01.674
of the boy with the fish in his
hand and another guy who's

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-3
00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:04.711
waving. And the guy with the
book is putting his hand up as

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-4
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:07.899
if he's saying no to the little
fish thing that the kid pulled

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-5
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.087
out of the drawer. And the guys
pointing to bread in his book.

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-6
00:10:11.087 --> 00:10:14.123
And looks like he's trying to
communicate that to the first

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-7
00:10:14.123 --> 00:10:17.160
the people, and then the other
guy, the one who was waiting

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-8
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.994
before with glasses of white
shirt. He then points to a

78ad30a2-a89d-49ea-a4d0-bfc78cdbf740-9
00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.979
different drawer in the wall and
he pulls out a different.

a592e6e3-d5dd-4c8f-bac7-93a5f1492e23-0
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.103
Shape and it's like a black
curly thing. The guy with the

a592e6e3-d5dd-4c8f-bac7-93a5f1492e23-1
00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:29.251
book smells, looks like he's
smelling it or has it up close

a592e6e3-d5dd-4c8f-bac7-93a5f1492e23-2
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:32.504
to his face. The kid has a a
basket now and then the guy with

a592e6e3-d5dd-4c8f-bac7-93a5f1492e23-3
00:10:32.504 --> 00:10:35.862
the book carries the basket with
that little black swirly thing

a592e6e3-d5dd-4c8f-bac7-93a5f1492e23-4
00:10:35.862 --> 00:10:39.220
in it, and he's talking to the
guy with the white shirt and the

a592e6e3-d5dd-4c8f-bac7-93a5f1492e23-5
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.060
glasses and the.

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-0
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.339
Um, the guy in the top left is
the one who is waving in the

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-1
00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:50.976
last picture of the white shirt
and he pulled things out of the

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-2
00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:54.328
drawer before. So he has a
different type shape like Ridge

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-3
00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:57.511
thing, Ridge creature or
something. And then the kid is

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-4
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:01.147
holding this big black, almost
looks like a cornucopia. And and

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-5
00:11:01.147 --> 00:11:04.443
then the guy next to him looks
like he has something else

1723b494-1007-4e68-b990-6bd3e21e0f48-6
00:11:04.443 --> 00:11:07.910
pulled out of the drawer, almost
looked like a like a plant.

a1657d36-0027-44ff-9eee-5f4553ca9e2b-0
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.648
And the kid has this big thing.
Looks like a big artichoke in

a1657d36-0027-44ff-9eee-5f4553ca9e2b-1
00:11:12.648 --> 00:11:16.247
his arms now and then. Looks
like the guys hands are holding

a1657d36-0027-44ff-9eee-5f4553ca9e2b-2
00:11:16.247 --> 00:11:18.430
something. Looks almost like a
crab.

f9895373-6d83-45af-bba4-8ffd7e51ef79-0
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.513
And then the next picture, he's
pulling out what looks like a

f9895373-6d83-45af-bba4-8ffd7e51ef79-1
00:11:22.513 --> 00:11:25.826
snake out of one of the other
drawers in the in the wall. And

f9895373-6d83-45af-bba4-8ffd7e51ef79-2
00:11:25.826 --> 00:11:29.032
then there's a picture of him
with thumbs up and holding it

f9895373-6d83-45af-bba4-8ffd7e51ef79-3
00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:31.329
different, like a a fish in his
left hand.

ff36b5e7-296b-4ccf-92da-f0d28b54297f-0
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.240
And then there's a picture of
him.

357b3334-5e5e-4fe8-ac09-f5148bd73e13-0
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.438
Having something looks like it
was cut open, so I don't know if

357b3334-5e5e-4fe8-ac09-f5148bd73e13-1
00:11:38.438 --> 00:11:39.020
it was like a.

b4a9e63f-4524-43bd-8a78-6753faf628e7-0
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.210
Sweet potato or something looks
like that's got kind of shape.

b4a9e63f-4524-43bd-8a78-6753faf628e7-1
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.223
And then the kid next to him has
something that he is holding up

b4a9e63f-4524-43bd-8a78-6753faf628e7-2
00:11:46.223 --> 00:11:46.780
to his hand.

850b420c-3012-4729-9187-7a353fb2d1b2-0
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.003
And then jump to his mouth, I
mean, and then the bottom left

850b420c-3012-4729-9187-7a353fb2d1b2-1
00:11:51.003 --> 00:11:51.560
of the guy.

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-0
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.574
It's the original guy in the
last picture he had the book, he

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-1
00:11:56.574 --> 00:11:59.767
was one of the suit and he his
holding that half of those sweet

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-2
00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:02.961
potato type thing at the other
guy I've been holding before and

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-3
00:12:02.961 --> 00:12:05.955
there's a kid in the bottom
center who's now feeding. Looks

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-4
00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:09.000
like he's feeding something to
the little fish creature that

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-5
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.193
was on the floor. And then the
guy in the suit now has a basket

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-6
00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:15.337
full of all these things that
they had pulled out of the wall.

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-7
00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:18.282
So the plant looking thing,
sweet potatoes and black curly

7d3b6270-bcc9-4ffa-a9f0-f65197b9dbde-8
00:12:18.282 --> 00:12:19.380
thing, all that stuff.

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-0
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.435
In the top right, there's a
little kid saying something to

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-1
00:12:23.435 --> 00:12:26.804
the white, the guy in the white
shirt, and then he also has a

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-2
00:12:26.804 --> 00:12:30.281
basket of stuff, and the guy in
the suit has a basket of stuff.

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-3
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:33.215
And then the kid also has a
basket of stuff, and he's

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-4
00:12:33.215 --> 00:12:36.475
pointing away in the picture.
And then you see the three of

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-5
00:12:36.475 --> 00:12:39.681
them in a broader span of the
picture walking. And there's

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-6
00:12:39.681 --> 00:12:43.050
like a couple ships that are
docked like on land, though. And

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-7
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.418
then behind them you see pretty
like white cityscape skyline.

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-8
00:12:46.418 --> 00:12:49.624
And there's like on a hill and
there's circles and there's

068aeae6-ba0a-4060-8b3d-20db81b4dc48-9
00:12:49.624 --> 00:12:51.200
pointy buildings and there's.

51b3be98-8e97-4b5b-9d8b-7ec8478a5d75-0
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.090
Some of the big bases and things
that are kind of out of

51b3be98-8e97-4b5b-9d8b-7ec8478a5d75-1
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.550
proportion.

9a72feb8-196f-4d1c-9975-b612430e76e8-0
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.088
The top left, there's a kid
walking with the basket, and the

9a72feb8-196f-4d1c-9975-b612430e76e8-1
00:13:03.088 --> 00:13:05.931
little fish thing is speaking.
He's walking towards one of

9a72feb8-196f-4d1c-9975-b612430e76e8-2
00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:08.821
these little boats that are
docked with the vase in it. And

9a72feb8-196f-4d1c-9975-b612430e76e8-3
00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.760
then there's kid standing next
to the vase, and then there's

9a72feb8-196f-4d1c-9975-b612430e76e8-4
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.940
the guy in the suit and the kid.
I'm looking at the vase that has

9a72feb8-196f-4d1c-9975-b612430e76e8-5
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.000
something black in it.

08c52dbb-f537-4cf7-9acb-5104a3ea5620-0
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.079
And then looks like the guy
startled by that black thing

08c52dbb-f537-4cf7-9acb-5104a3ea5620-1
00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:23.184
coming out of the face, and he
drops his basket full stuff and

08c52dbb-f537-4cf7-9acb-5104a3ea5620-2
00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:24.910
the kid has a hand over his
mouth.

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-0
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.143
The guy in the white shirt looks
like he's trying to console the

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-1
00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:32.314
guy in the suit and he's smiling
and he points to it and then the

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-2
00:13:32.314 --> 00:13:35.198
kid pulls out, looks like a
weird cat looking creature that

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-3
00:13:35.198 --> 00:13:38.177
came out of the vase. And then
the kid holds the cat up close

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-4
00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:41.252
and the picture you can see it.
And then the guy in the suit of

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-5
00:13:41.252 --> 00:13:44.184
looking at it closer while the
kids still holding it and the

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-6
00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:47.115
guy in the white shirt is knelt
down pointing to it and he's

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-7
00:13:47.115 --> 00:13:50.238
pointing to in the next picture
you can see the cat and the fish

f5ff6e3b-235f-4064-a496-db4e4535caaa-8
00:13:50.238 --> 00:13:53.169
are on the floor. That's kind of
like looking at each other.

bc753e67-9a09-48d8-b641-e574f86a3f64-0
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.169
And then it looks like maybe
they're playing together in the

bc753e67-9a09-48d8-b641-e574f86a3f64-1
00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:00.578
top right side and then they're
picking up the items out of the

bc753e67-9a09-48d8-b641-e574f86a3f64-2
00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:02.070
guys basket that he dropped.

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-0
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.323
And then they use
talking to the guy in the white

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-1
00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:10.163
shirt and looks like he's trying
to use some hand gestures. And

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-2
00:14:10.163 --> 00:14:12.824
then he pulls out his book and
he starts drawing things and

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-3
00:14:12.824 --> 00:14:15.575
then he shows it to the guy in
the white shirt. And the white

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-4
00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:18.148
shirt guy seems like he's a
little confused. He uses hand

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-5
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:20.721
gestures and he's looking up.
And then you see closer and

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-6
00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:23.295
closer to his face and his
glasses, and then you see just

e35edaf2-d105-449a-8460-bcd6cf4a78ad-7
00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:23.650
his eye. #END_arrival_4 

b9fdfe1e-2f31-4041-a11a-389a53b2706f-0
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.383
All right. That was his part of
the story. And you took around

b9fdfe1e-2f31-4041-a11a-389a53b2706f-1
00:14:28.383 --> 00:14:30.030
12 minutes, which is good.

d7e87b8c-2336-42a4-978b-89758c230740-0
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.220
So a different type of pictures
that you'll see in this study,

d7e87b8c-2336-42a4-978b-89758c230740-1
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.100
we called them complex scenes.

3ecf9308-ab58-4586-a90b-35ed033ce4de-0
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.048
So they're just one page, and
again, imagine you're describing

3ecf9308-ab58-4586-a90b-35ed033ce4de-1
00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:46.145
it to somebody who cannot see
it. Describe what is happening

3ecf9308-ab58-4586-a90b-35ed033ce4de-2
00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:50.174
and what you see as thoroughly
as possible, and try to take

3ecf9308-ab58-4586-a90b-35ed033ce4de-3
00:14:50.174 --> 00:14:53.130
between three and five minutes
to do that.

5d582be2-ecd9-4448-8ad1-a9a5cd233a0e-0
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.680
So here we go.

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-0
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.460
So just this one picture. Yes.
OK all right.

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-1
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.510
#START_escape_from_the_zoo So
this is an open, I guess two

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-2
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.560
page spread and it says escape
from the zoo. And there's a

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-3
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.714
caption on the bottom that says
the Penguins were bored with

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-4
00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:13.868
life at the zoo, so they hatched
a plan to escape from their

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-5
00:15:13.868 --> 00:15:16.608
enclosure. They are enjoying
their newfound freedom,

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-6
00:15:16.608 --> 00:15:19.866
completely unaware of the chaos
they have created around them.

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-7
00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:22.916
Spike love skateboarding and
Muffy cannot believe that ice

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-8
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:26.225
cream cones taste so good. And
it says can you pick all out all

ea8bcfca-32a7-4d79-be84-4d0891273f71-9
00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.879
10 Penguins. So in the top left.

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-0
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.114
On the broader scheme, you see
almost like a central part of

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-1
00:15:32.114 --> 00:15:35.989
the zoo. When you first walk in,
there's a center area and then

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-2
00:15:35.989 --> 00:15:39.744
there is a pathway that goes
left or right towards the front,

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-3
00:15:39.744 --> 00:15:43.680
towards the bottom of the page.
So in the top left you see polar

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-4
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.435
bears and and little bit more.
In the foreground you see like

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-5
00:15:47.435 --> 00:15:51.068
some lemurs and a tree branch.
And then to the right of the

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-6
00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:55.004
polar bears there's an elephant
enclosure and there's an ostrich

e91722ff-6cb6-4f53-b997-39edfd5ba7fe-7
00:15:55.004 --> 00:15:57.730
and a rhinoceros and then you'll
see a cafe.

a4750f9e-37ac-4cfd-a6cc-a4182abae227-0
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.223
And then next to the cafe you
see like a shop at the gift

a4750f9e-37ac-4cfd-a6cc-a4182abae227-1
00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:07.719
shop. And then to the right of
that now you're at the top right

a4750f9e-37ac-4cfd-a6cc-a4182abae227-2
00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:11.582
of the page is a bunch of
gorillas which 1236, about 6

a4750f9e-37ac-4cfd-a6cc-a4182abae227-3
00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:15.656
gorillas there. And then
underneath the gorillas there is

a4750f9e-37ac-4cfd-a6cc-a4182abae227-4
00:16:15.656 --> 00:16:19.730
it looks like a helicopter or a
Penguin and a helicopter.

501ebc0b-8c18-41eb-be05-7e6c74be11e8-0
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.870
And there's like a parrot or a
macaw next to it.

e6ef6eb8-5287-49f7-8ef3-e120a46aaf42-0
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.357
And then underneath them now,
because they're kind of in the

e6ef6eb8-5287-49f7-8ef3-e120a46aaf42-1
00:16:28.357 --> 00:16:31.849
air underneath them as an
exhibit with some drafts, some

e6ef6eb8-5287-49f7-8ef3-e120a46aaf42-2
00:16:31.849 --> 00:16:35.648
kind of antelope with a bunch of
big antlers on, maybe like a

e6ef6eb8-5287-49f7-8ef3-e120a46aaf42-3
00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:39.447
wild boar, maybe anteater, a
couple different animals in that

e6ef6eb8-5287-49f7-8ef3-e120a46aaf42-4
00:16:39.447 --> 00:16:40.060
enclosure.

a4c0d12e-7853-4c78-8181-09ba09629e59-0
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.491
And then underneath that in the
so the bottom right of the

a4c0d12e-7853-4c78-8181-09ba09629e59-1
00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:48.252
screen, you'll see a bunch of
people running because there's a

a4c0d12e-7853-4c78-8181-09ba09629e59-2
00:16:48.252 --> 00:16:50.699
rhinoceros that's loose in the
sidewalk.

86f61a77-4f4a-4948-8695-45cbe0de1124-0
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.281
There's also a snake that's also
loose on the sidewalk, so

86f61a77-4f4a-4948-8695-45cbe0de1124-1
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:56.195
there's a bunch of people
running there. One has an

86f61a77-4f4a-4948-8695-45cbe0de1124-2
00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:58.220
umbrella on their hands, a
couple of different colors.

bfbd5ecd-9e40-4e50-8df8-469c99189dda-0
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.678
And then towards the center
bottom of the page. You'll see a

bfbd5ecd-9e40-4e50-8df8-469c99189dda-1
00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:06.355
line exhibit. There's like
there's a female and a male lion

bfbd5ecd-9e40-4e50-8df8-469c99189dda-2
00:17:06.355 --> 00:17:07.030
and like a.

f018d992-3b9a-4f4d-a22a-788ab335b87c-0
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.330
Little animal that's popping out
of the ground as well and

f018d992-3b9a-4f4d-a22a-788ab335b87c-1
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.085
there's some people that are in
the line enclosure, so they're

f018d992-3b9a-4f4d-a22a-788ab335b87c-2
00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:15.753
trying to pull themselves out.
Some people are sitting there

f018d992-3b9a-4f4d-a22a-788ab335b87c-3
00:17:15.753 --> 00:17:18.464
and you see like they have the
cartoons, that they're scared.

f018d992-3b9a-4f4d-a22a-788ab335b87c-4
00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:21.263
They have this little hash marks
around their face like they're

f018d992-3b9a-4f4d-a22a-788ab335b87c-5
00:17:21.263 --> 00:17:21.570
afraid.

43796b84-f810-4136-aaea-e0df95566a69-0
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.188
And then you see, um, towards
the center of the page. There's

43796b84-f810-4136-aaea-e0df95566a69-1
00:17:26.188 --> 00:17:28.880
a Peacock right there in the
middle of the sidewalk.

10ac6691-deda-472d-8da1-472c04422584-0
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.709
And
then towards the center left,

10ac6691-deda-472d-8da1-472c04422584-1
00:17:32.709 --> 00:17:35.693
you'll see that an enclosure on
the left has a hippo and

10ac6691-deda-472d-8da1-472c04422584-2
00:17:35.693 --> 00:17:38.940
flamingos and looks like some
kind of a Pelican and then some

10ac6691-deda-472d-8da1-472c04422584-3
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.820
zebras when you get to the full
left side of the page. #END_escape_from_the_zoo 

65889a80-94ca-4792-b080-c23d5c2e7000-0
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.625
And then there was about 5
minutes. OK, we are good here

65889a80-94ca-4792-b080-c23d5c2e7000-1
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:50.320
and you're about to see more of
these complex scenes.

92d901fd-0eaa-4978-b112-d6add7c97e5f-0
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.420
So just do the same thing
again.

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-0
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.008
#START_unfriendly_giants OK, so
this one says the unfriendly

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-1
00:18:01.008 --> 00:18:04.230
giants. Um. Then Waldo and
Wizard White Beard came to the

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-2
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.396
land of the unfriendly giants
where many waldos had been

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-3
00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:10.507
before. And waldos. All of the
Giants were horridly and

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-4
00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.673
harassing that little people.
And when he found the 10th

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-5
00:18:13.673 --> 00:18:17.062
scroll, it was time to continue
with his journey. So you see

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-6
00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:20.395
there's a bunch of smaller
people and a bunch of giants and

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-7
00:18:20.395 --> 00:18:24.061
there's kind of like 3 levels of
the picture. At the bottom level

7c72a793-acfd-4835-bc37-1570d6581768-8
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:27.449
there's 123456 giants that are
playing like a chess game or.

49a42cd0-d957-46bc-9769-ced6b62c9be1-0
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.165
and different smaller people has
figurines around them. There's a

49a42cd0-d957-46bc-9769-ced6b62c9be1-1
00:18:32.165 --> 00:18:36.200
bunch of small people. They have
a like little house on the left.

109cbb46-0513-443d-886a-004028b77b28-0
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.559
A little smaller house in the
center and then on the far right

109cbb46-0513-443d-886a-004028b77b28-1
00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:45.721
bottom they have there's four
giants and looks like they're

109cbb46-0513-443d-886a-004028b77b28-2
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:49.120
using straws to suck up water
out of the ground.

0a0a1d74-b741-4429-ac03-5a65305d00dc-0
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.700
And the one has sucked it up
completely dry and the one spot.

2fc42320-b2b1-4bb3-8fd5-3f6ea707da7a-0
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.234
Um, so the second tier of the
picture, there's a man or male

2fc42320-b2b1-4bb3-8fd5-3f6ea707da7a-1
00:18:57.234 --> 00:19:00.999
giant, looks like he pulled out
a tree out of the ground, and

2fc42320-b2b1-4bb3-8fd5-3f6ea707da7a-2
00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:04.885
he's handing it to a woman as if
it's like a bouquet of flowers

2fc42320-b2b1-4bb3-8fd5-3f6ea707da7a-3
00:19:04.885 --> 00:19:06.100
next to her. Is this

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-0
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.120
Built up wooden structure with
like almost like a hammer kind

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-1
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.751
of thing that you hold you would
see at a carnival that would

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-2
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:18.324
kind of fall down. But next to
the left of him there's a guy

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-3
00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:22.130
knelt down with his tipping his
hat off to so little people next

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-4
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.761
to him. And then there's two
gentlemen or two giants that are

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-5
00:19:25.761 --> 00:19:29.392
in the middle. One has a piece
of rope tied around his ankle,

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-6
00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:33.199
looks like the small people are
trying to pull him down. Another

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-7
00:19:33.199 --> 00:19:36.888
one has a rope wrapped around a
bunch of small people in their

f3d98928-2ce2-41de-85c6-755de50202b5-8
00:19:36.888 --> 00:19:37.240
house.

df7cd973-f5c3-4dd7-bdb5-74726ea27adc-0
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.380
And then the far left, there's a
woman waving again. She has one

df7cd973-f5c3-4dd7-bdb5-74726ea27adc-1
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.547
of those wooden structures built
up with a hammer on top, and

df7cd973-f5c3-4dd7-bdb5-74726ea27adc-2
00:19:44.547 --> 00:19:47.612
she's waving to another male
giant. And there's a couple of

df7cd973-f5c3-4dd7-bdb5-74726ea27adc-3
00:19:47.612 --> 00:19:49.860
small houses and little people
around them.

647366b8-7c3d-4e10-aec0-6d29e3cebaee-0
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.181
And then the top right of the
picture, there's a little bit

647366b8-7c3d-4e10-aec0-6d29e3cebaee-1
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:57.701
further distance back, there is
a man and a woman again with a

647366b8-7c3d-4e10-aec0-6d29e3cebaee-2
00:19:57.701 --> 00:20:01.276

he's using an upside down tree
as like a a broom.

57c21020-558a-47e6-918a-4f6f1f572d8f-0
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.850
And then above him there's a
windmill with a giant up there.

3ee4c6a9-89aa-4b4a-b687-5862da769f42-0
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.507
And there is. It's a couple more
giants that are going looking at

3ee4c6a9-89aa-4b4a-b687-5862da769f42-1
00:20:13.507 --> 00:20:17.055
the little people within their
boats in the river, and there's

3ee4c6a9-89aa-4b4a-b687-5862da769f42-2
00:20:17.055 --> 00:20:20.715
some giants that are up towards
the top of the castle. There's a

3ee4c6a9-89aa-4b4a-b687-5862da769f42-3
00:20:20.715 --> 00:20:22.180
castle on top of the page.

2a8db938-0c6d-4feb-ad83-1627c9fcbf44-0
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.037
And then there's some giants
that are like overreaching over

2a8db938-0c6d-4feb-ad83-1627c9fcbf44-1
00:20:27.037 --> 00:20:27.620
some trees.

ae254a1a-77b8-43cd-b673-1d9cfdeb27fc-0
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.061
Let's see, there's some other
looks like they pulled a house

ae254a1a-77b8-43cd-b673-1d9cfdeb27fc-1
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:35.783
out of the ground, and then
there's a window on the top left

00:20:35.783 --> 00:20:36.140
as well.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.620
And let's see.

badb0307-8255-4c7d-bfcd-df97a5ce450e-0
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.720
Pictures
for general in general. The

badb0307-8255-4c7d-bfcd-df97a5ce450e-1
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.650
colors are all like red, yellow,
blue-green and most of the

badb0307-8255-4c7d-bfcd-df97a5ce450e-2
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.360
picture and some orange and
brown. #END_unfriendly_giants 

56e74157-ada5-4062-a112-dd8635e11a76-0
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.280
Do you need anymore?

1945e70e-a91e-484b-8e7b-c9fa3dbe5374-0
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.980
No, we're good. That was about
four minutes. We're good.

63f58c9a-0638-456f-b2a8-f686ca7516c7-0
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.610
So.

fceb1626-f461-4cdd-a801-7b5dacdb391d-0
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.820
Here's the next one.

a82ae221-f2d7-4375-9bd3-1d7ce27e726d-0
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.448
Umm, again, I'll just, um, I
notice that you've been reading

a82ae221-f2d7-4375-9bd3-1d7ce27e726d-1
00:21:05.448 --> 00:21:10.184
some of these description. It's
good to read them so that maybe

a82ae221-f2d7-4375-9bd3-1d7ce27e726d-2
00:21:10.184 --> 00:21:14.402
that's helpful for you that
describe them, but you don't

a82ae221-f2d7-4375-9bd3-1d7ce27e726d-3
00:21:14.402 --> 00:21:16.770
have to read them out loud, OK?

b8d896a3-8005-4975-a1d8-a0a5b4cfe737-0
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.500
#START_wild_west OK, so this one
is wild Wild West and it looks

b8d896a3-8005-4975-a1d8-a0a5b4cfe737-1
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.461
like it's like a two page
spread. So the left side on the

b8d896a3-8005-4975-a1d8-a0a5b4cfe737-2
00:21:26.461 --> 00:21:30.627
bottom there's a jail with a
sheriff sign and there's people

b8d896a3-8005-4975-a1d8-a0a5b4cfe737-3
00:21:30.627 --> 00:21:34.724
standing outside looks like
cowboy hats and there's a horse

b8d896a3-8005-4975-a1d8-a0a5b4cfe737-4
00:21:34.724 --> 00:21:38.890
that looks like actually he's
painting something on a canvas

b8d896a3-8005-4975-a1d8-a0a5b4cfe737-5
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.120
look like a wagon.

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-0
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.497
And then there's a bunch of
stamps that are upright that

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-1
00:21:44.497 --> 00:21:48.398
have a bunch of bison, their
faces on them on the side of the

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-2
00:21:48.398 --> 00:21:52.489
jail there's a wanted sign with
two faces on it and in black and

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-3
00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:55.950
white picture. And then the
buildings are kind of on a

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-4
00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:00.104
diagonal. So next to the jail is
the hotel and it looks like it's

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-5
00:22:00.104 --> 00:22:03.628
a 3 tiered building. There's
people all around and it's

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-6
00:22:03.628 --> 00:22:07.530
almost like an open building.
The way it looks in the picture

bcec014c-79b3-45af-b539-f49118d3db5c-7
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.739
next to that is a saloon and it
has a front porch.

13b0a4e4-76e3-45fa-b853-1303e5678f35-0
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.197
And the word Saloon on top with
the slanted roof above that, and

13b0a4e4-76e3-45fa-b853-1303e5678f35-1
00:22:14.197 --> 00:22:17.116
there's two guys on the slanted
roof. Looks like they're

13b0a4e4-76e3-45fa-b853-1303e5678f35-2
00:22:17.116 --> 00:22:20.239
throwing things at each other.
And next to that is a general

13b0a4e4-76e3-45fa-b853-1303e5678f35-3
00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:23.260
store looks like, but the part
of that picture is cut off.

a5a691c1-652b-4297-9aa1-1119e1a94e06-0
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.073
And so then above that it's a
another row of buildings and the

a5a691c1-652b-4297-9aa1-1119e1a94e06-1
00:22:28.073 --> 00:22:31.391
top it says the tangy saloon
again, there's a like a patio

a5a691c1-652b-4297-9aa1-1119e1a94e06-2
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:34.821
and there's people on the patio
and there's people on top of

a5a691c1-652b-4297-9aa1-1119e1a94e06-3
00:22:34.821 --> 00:22:38.196
that on the roof and the same
thing in the building next to

a5a691c1-652b-4297-9aa1-1119e1a94e06-4
00:22:38.196 --> 00:22:41.682
that. And then it looks like
there's a hotel and then another

a5a691c1-652b-4297-9aa1-1119e1a94e06-5
00:22:41.682 --> 00:22:43.370
Wild West and then next to it.

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-0
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.908
Underneath that you'll see some
wagons and some people in the

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-1
00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:51.655
streets and looks like gold
mines and there's a bunch of you

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-2
00:22:51.655 --> 00:22:55.525
know yellow and I am assuming
gold. And then on the right side

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-3
00:22:55.525 --> 00:22:59.088
and right side of the picture
there is no top right again

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-4
00:22:59.088 --> 00:23:02.835
there's a saloon sign patio that
people around people on the

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-5
00:23:02.835 --> 00:23:06.644
roof. There's looks like once
like a movie picture screen and

da08f42d-b4a7-4732-8464-1927fa2dca36-6
00:23:06.644 --> 00:23:08.180
there's a guy on a horse.

ea5869b6-524d-40be-a239-67adaf46b870-0
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.470
It's like breaking through the
screen.

2c316afa-3b3e-4c0d-ad6e-f3959d4f2fa3-0
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.715
And there's a bunch of people
standing next to it, and there's

2c316afa-3b3e-4c0d-ad6e-f3959d4f2fa3-1
00:23:15.715 --> 00:23:18.990
some of the people holding
luggage and bags and there's a.

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-0
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.025
Delivery unstable or livery
stable blacksmith. And then

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-1
00:23:23.025 --> 00:23:26.508
there's a guy standing on a
ladder and then there's people

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-2
00:23:26.508 --> 00:23:29.813
also on the roof of that
building. They're looking down

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-3
00:23:29.813 --> 00:23:33.473
at the the screen with the guy
and the horses running through

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-4
00:23:33.473 --> 00:23:37.310
the screen. Next to that there's
like a saloon building. There's

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-5
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.205
people on playing on a piano and
singing and playing music on the

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-6
00:23:41.205 --> 00:23:44.865
roof part of the building. And
then below that and the second

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-7
00:23:44.865 --> 00:23:48.289
tier of the picture is the the
Pioneer Saloon, which more

0f39f4be-6db4-4703-a7fc-be53bfe9e0a4-8
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:50.060
people with guitars and stuff.

f3b4ec96-9109-4439-b7b3-e0ce4c44e3ee-0
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.698
On the roof of that building and
then next to that's a bank and

f3b4ec96-9109-4439-b7b3-e0ce4c44e3ee-1
00:23:53.698 --> 00:23:57.099
then next to that's another
saloon and there's people on the

f3b4ec96-9109-4439-b7b3-e0ce4c44e3ee-2
00:23:57.099 --> 00:24:00.555
roof of the saloon and looks
like they're doing some painting

f3b4ec96-9109-4439-b7b3-e0ce4c44e3ee-3
00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:02.340
of the the buildings next to it.

2765db86-b173-4126-829b-a8535d124ca5-0
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.812
Um, there's looks like a
cannonball on the one roof of

2765db86-b173-4126-829b-a8535d124ca5-1
00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:10.310
the the one more saloon building
on the far right.

b7f0cea9-1338-4fb7-9fc7-c2af2f020011-0
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.811
And then underneath that, you'll
see a train track coming in from

b7f0cea9-1338-4fb7-9fc7-c2af2f020011-1
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:18.297
a diagonal. There's a train,
it's a red and black train, and

b7f0cea9-1338-4fb7-9fc7-c2af2f020011-2
00:24:18.297 --> 00:24:21.897
there's also like a wagon that
was right in front of the train

b7f0cea9-1338-4fb7-9fc7-c2af2f020011-3
00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:24.640
tracks. It looks like it's on
the train tracks.

0f61d414-0ba6-4ac0-977e-52ea6b8beb9c-0
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.835
And then next to
that, there is a building with a

0f61d414-0ba6-4ac0-977e-52ea6b8beb9c-1
00:24:28.835 --> 00:24:31.872
bunch of people and they're
carrying some things. So it

0f61d414-0ba6-4ac0-977e-52ea6b8beb9c-2
00:24:31.872 --> 00:24:35.289
looks like it's leaning, looks
like a saloon, maybe some signs

0f61d414-0ba6-4ac0-977e-52ea6b8beb9c-3
00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:38.760
and their brooms and all kinds
of things that they're carrying. #END_wild_west 

7767c69e-4cdd-4ece-8e0d-bc70c7ad5746-0
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.970
OK, so that was about 5
minutes. We can move on to the

7767c69e-4cdd-4ece-8e0d-bc70c7ad5746-1
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.920
next one.

e024bec4-4961-4506-8592-1e337a60ab80-0
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.958
#START_being_a_pirate OK, so
this picture is one a bunch of

e024bec4-4961-4506-8592-1e337a60ab80-1
00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:57.849
people on the sorry bunch of
boats. There's one large ship on

e024bec4-4961-4506-8592-1e337a60ab80-2
00:24:57.849 --> 00:25:00.834
the left, it's like another two
page spread, another large ship

e024bec4-4961-4506-8592-1e337a60ab80-3
00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:02.140
on the left and then change.

c7e4a38d-096d-4462-8f5c-a42223804ea8-0
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.273
About 15 small boats, Umm, and
the little row boats because

c7e4a38d-096d-4462-8f5c-a42223804ea8-1
00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:12.183
they have the oars. And then
there's a smaller pirate ship in

c7e4a38d-096d-4462-8f5c-a42223804ea8-2
00:25:12.183 --> 00:25:15.840
the back in the top right
because you see a couple pirate

c7e4a38d-096d-4462-8f5c-a42223804ea8-3
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.497
flags with the skull and
crossbones. And then also on the

c7e4a38d-096d-4462-8f5c-a42223804ea8-4
00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:23.344
far left of the screen looks
like there is just the the back

c7e4a38d-096d-4462-8f5c-a42223804ea8-5
00:25:23.344 --> 00:25:25.109
end of another ship as well.

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-0
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.661
Some pirate flags as well, and
on the far right you'll see like

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-1
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:33.065
a beach line scape, some sand,
some palm trees. Some people

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-2
00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:36.696
were digging for treasure. I'm
seeing some treasure chests. You

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-3
00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:39.986
see people who are in like
sailor outfits or the blue and

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-4
00:25:39.986 --> 00:25:43.334
white outfits and they're in
some of these ships. And then

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-5
00:25:43.334 --> 00:25:46.625
the top right of the screen
you'll see on the beach has a

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-6
00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:50.142
little bit of a hillside as well
with some mountains and some

04f364ad-fbdf-48bf-8002-ed9e7126d78e-7
00:25:50.142 --> 00:25:50.710
trees too.

46ebb17a-2973-43a0-920e-37d0cc5288fe-0
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.598
So the ship that's on the top
right, and you'll see that

46ebb17a-2973-43a0-920e-37d0cc5288fe-1
00:25:54.598 --> 00:25:55.830
there's a bunch of people.

c936b05d-8094-4af3-b33c-719101bb13dc-0
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.176
On the different masts of the
tree, I mean of the ship. And

c936b05d-8094-4af3-b33c-719101bb13dc-1
00:26:00.176 --> 00:26:03.927
then there's people, you know,
walking around the ship. There's

c936b05d-8094-4af3-b33c-719101bb13dc-2
00:26:03.927 --> 00:26:07.561
people, you know, sliding off of
the rope. Looks like there's

c936b05d-8094-4af3-b33c-719101bb13dc-3
00:26:07.561 --> 00:26:11.430
some sharks in the water and the
left of that. And there's people

c936b05d-8094-4af3-b33c-719101bb13dc-4
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.888
who are throwing things into
another row boats. Looks like

c936b05d-8094-4af3-b33c-719101bb13dc-5
00:26:14.888 --> 00:26:17.350
there's some people were
throwing things.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.825
I can't tell. The cannibals are
going towards the shipper coming

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-1
00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:25.073
away from the ship, but then
there's a couple other boats and

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-2
00:26:25.073 --> 00:26:28.269
there's a guy looks like he's
almost taking a bath in one of

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-3
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:31.517
the small little boats just by
himself. There's an octopus in

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-4
00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:34.608
the water who has a couple
people on it and its tentacles.

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-5
00:26:34.608 --> 00:26:37.647
There's towards the bottom
you'll see there's a ship that

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-6
00:26:37.647 --> 00:26:41.000
looks like a little rowboat that
broke in half, and some people

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-7
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.300
who were scrambling out water
and there was a guy surfing on a

4dcec6c8-75a9-43d4-91a0-bd66445675ff-8
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.820
piece of the boat next to it.

7da4a7a9-281a-4a02-a7b9-ee0f7309fa60-0
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.240
Umm.

7647dab1-c051-48d5-8742-44966b90d72f-0
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.601
And then see it towards the
bottom right, you'll see more

7647dab1-c051-48d5-8742-44966b90d72f-1
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:54.610
people trying to jump off of one
of those row boats.

13678c37-a5e2-4859-a825-04fd0b629b95-0
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.070
And towards the left the big
ship that has like a.

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-0
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.886
Like a Gold Mermaid type figure
at the bottom left. See a

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-1
00:27:04.886 --> 00:27:07.872
cannonball that's being released
off of that ship. Couple

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-2
00:27:07.872 --> 00:27:10.755
cannonballs from different
directions. It's also taking

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-3
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:13.998
fire from cannonballs from on
the small boats, and you can see

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-4
00:27:13.998 --> 00:27:17.087
one of the top of the mass, like
crows nest, there's people

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-5
00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:20.125
flying out of it, a bunch of
ladders and lots of people on

c0d7affe-a6e9-44ff-a6a5-256897be23f3-6
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:20.640
that ship.

98c675f5-ea5d-47f6-b96e-b56b2873f4a0-0
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.393
And then the
far left, just the tail end of

98c675f5-ea5d-47f6-b96e-b56b2873f4a0-1
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:27.143
that ship is you see the red and
the gold of it and sort of

98c675f5-ea5d-47f6-b96e-b56b2873f4a0-2
00:27:27.143 --> 00:27:29.160
people also on a little rowboat
next to it. #END_being_a_pirate

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.840
Alright, so that was about 3
minutes.

One more of them.

05c00d8a-8463-4704-9d85-a7d98d0db896-0
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.946
#START_by_the_lake So this one
says by the lake um, so it looks

05c00d8a-8463-4704-9d85-a7d98d0db896-1
00:27:46.946 --> 00:27:50.458
like there is a beach line on
the bottom, kind of almost like

05c00d8a-8463-4704-9d85-a7d98d0db896-2
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:54.084
a see part of the bottom part of
the of the picture. And you'll

05c00d8a-8463-4704-9d85-a7d98d0db896-3
00:27:54.084 --> 00:27:57.710
see people on the beach playing
volleyball or some people under

05c00d8a-8463-4704-9d85-a7d98d0db896-4
00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.166
umbrella. There's some people
playing music, there's lots of

05c00d8a-8463-4704-9d85-a7d98d0db896-5

crowds of people.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.220
There's somebody flying a kite
and.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.795
Looks like somebody playing like
a bocci ball game as well.

b420a421-03c0-44f3-b4da-37e40e4c5d08-1
00:28:10.795 --> 00:28:14.439
There's kids playing in the sand
and in the water. They're

b420a421-03c0-44f3-b4da-37e40e4c5d08-2
00:28:14.439 --> 00:28:18.330
building a sandcastle. There's
some people who are laying on a

b420a421-03c0-44f3-b4da-37e40e4c5d08-3
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.379
raft on the sand.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.800
The bottom right looks like
there's people's.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.921
And people standing and talking
like there's a trash can and

95ae8de6-20c9-46a9-ab2a-70cafe50a758-1

next to the one of the umbrellas
where people are sitting by. And

95ae8de6-20c9-46a9-ab2a-70cafe50a758-3
00:28:37.355 --> 00:28:40.646
then if you go up towards the
right middle of the screen,

95ae8de6-20c9-46a9-ab2a-70cafe50a758-4
00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:44.335
there is the right middle of the
picture. I mean, there's like a

95ae8de6-20c9-46a9-ab2a-70cafe50a758-5
00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:47.569
little dock or there's some
people fishing off the dock.

95ae8de6-20c9-46a9-ab2a-70cafe50a758-6
00:28:47.569 --> 00:28:51.258
Above that you'll see some kids
doing different like stances and

95ae8de6-20c9-46a9-ab2a-70cafe50a758-7
00:28:51.258 --> 00:28:52.279

up ones on handstand and then
going up above that, you'll see

dfad1c92-7c29-4ecc-a90c-db1bccb8812d-2
00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:04.381
like a little cabin where
somebody is looking off of the

dfad1c92-7c29-4ecc-a90c-db1bccb8812d-3
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:07.230
railing and they're just kind of
looking at the water.

f2fd670d-dbd0-4a4a-9025-3b78e4f7a516-0
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.188
And then there's other people
who are grilling and like

00:29:11.188 --> 00:29:14.357
barbecuing. You'll see there's a
couple little rocks there.

f2fd670d-dbd0-4a4a-9025-3b78e4f7a516-2
00:29:14.357 --> 00:29:17.632
There's some people sitting on
top of the rocks and there's a

00:29:20.854 --> 00:29:24.129
bicycles on the rocks. And then
next to that. So in the water

f2fd670d-dbd0-4a4a-9025-3b78e4f7a516-5
00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:27.562
itself, there's people on rafts,
there's people who are on inner

f2fd670d-dbd0-4a4a-9025-3b78e4f7a516-6
00:29:27.562 --> 00:29:30.362

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.026
Um, there's also like a
stationary dock in the middle of

fdbd1cf1-7b15-417e-8634-8f8a39d9841c-1
00:29:46.026 --> 00:29:48.966
the water where there's some
people sitting there. There's a

fdbd1cf1-7b15-417e-8634-8f8a39d9841c-2
00:29:48.966 --> 00:29:52.050
ladder to get to it, left side
of the screen, there's some high

fdbd1cf1-7b15-417e-8634-8f8a39d9841c-3
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.990
rocks as well, and then it kind
of goes towards some smaller

fdbd1cf1-7b15-417e-8634-8f8a39d9841c-4
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.870
rocks. You see people like on a
canoe.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.747

00:30:01.747 --> 00:30:05.277
in a period pyramid. And then
you'll also see there's like a

5ffdf05d-4811-471a-b048-b6d7cae29dd9-2
00:30:05.277 --> 00:30:08.923
little building like Castle type
building on the water. And in

5ffdf05d-4811-471a-b048-b6d7cae29dd9-3
00:30:08.923 --> 00:30:12.511
the background at the very top
you see there's mountains with

5ffdf05d-4811-471a-b048-b6d7cae29dd9-4
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:15.809

And those
people were in their little

00:30:19.916 --> 00:30:22.819
boats. Also, there's some
sailboats in the background that

88779aa5-2bbb-4b7e-b37f-dfc1f76af048-2
00:30:22.819 --> 00:30:24.640
you don't necessarily see people

All right. OK. So let's see. So
before we go on to the next one,

fee0e16a-49e5-4553-8ea3-518401d04fb8-1

let's take a break.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.515
And this next one is a graphic
novel that has around 20 pages.

9be73bcb-055f-4dc6-a929-9c71a0e8b056-1
00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:47.881
Again, as you go through the
story, describe what is

9be73bcb-055f-4dc6-a929-9c71a0e8b056-2
00:30:47.881 --> 00:30:49.660
happening and what you see.

#START_quest OK, so on the left
page looks like its in a Park.

bdb18430-da59-40ac-a0f1-1897d1d39445-1
00:30:58.388 --> 00:31:02.964
There's a park bench with a lamp
post, a trash can next to it,

bdb18430-da59-40ac-a0f1-1897d1d39445-2
00:31:02.964 --> 00:31:07.540
some leaves behind it, and some
trees. And then there's like a

bdb18430-da59-40ac-a0f1-1897d1d39445-3
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.720

Um, almost looks like a figurine
of Hermes. Like like a.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.656
Like a God with wings and
there's like something on their

4600daea-bffa-4c3e-b823-fcddaf92e494-1
00:31:17.656 --> 00:31:19.880
head and they're wearing its
like a dress type.

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-0
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.759
Clothing and sandals, and
they're on a rock, that's what

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-1
00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:27.958
the statue is. And have
something in their hand. And

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-2
00:31:27.958 --> 00:31:31.700
then in the background it looks
like there's some like little

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-3
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.019
bit cloudier, but in the
background looks like there's

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-4
00:31:35.019 --> 00:31:38.580
some buildings behind it and
then another part of like the

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-5
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.502
Stonewall. And then on the right
side, it's kind of continuation

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-6
00:31:42.502 --> 00:31:45.761
of that wall. And you see
there's like an archway and

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-7
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:49.503
underpass. And underneath the
underpass there's two children.

24d43a64-f828-4083-ba5e-9220cd4a76bf-8
00:31:49.503 --> 00:31:50.650
Umm, they have Umm.

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-0
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.547
Bicycle next to him as well. And
then the bicycle is A 2 seater

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-1
00:31:54.547 --> 00:31:57.872
bicycle with a purple front
wheel and a red back wheel. The

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-2
00:31:57.872 --> 00:32:01.087
kids looked like might they be
doing, they might be doing

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-3
00:32:01.087 --> 00:32:04.690
graffiti. It looks like the one
has something red in his hand. I

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-4
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.960
want something purple in his
hand. And then behind them is

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-5
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.507
some purple on the wall. Looks
like there's some rain happening

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-6
00:32:11.507 --> 00:32:14.667
and they're taking you know,
some shelter underneath the

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-7
00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:18.048
archway. There's like a light
above them, like a little lamp

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-8
00:32:18.048 --> 00:32:21.318
above them, and then there's
like a wooden door built into

76d196b2-6df5-4fd2-99a8-60baf5057417-9
00:32:21.318 --> 00:32:21.539
the.

5d6cab08-eccf-4156-be5b-c41df9bde9eb-0
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:25.108
Underpass where their standing
next to the door is closed and

5d6cab08-eccf-4156-be5b-c41df9bde9eb-1
00:32:25.108 --> 00:32:28.541
then on the other side of the
underpass you see continuation

5d6cab08-eccf-4156-be5b-c41df9bde9eb-2
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:32.029
of the Stonewall and there's
another park bench and some more

5d6cab08-eccf-4156-be5b-c41df9bde9eb-3
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.930
light lampposts.

c5ad7169-c561-47a3-96ff-c5b3354f56d1-0
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.743
And then there's another statue
above that Stonewall on the

c5ad7169-c561-47a3-96ff-c5b3354f56d1-1
00:32:39.743 --> 00:32:43.608
other side of the underpass as
well. And then in the foreground

c5ad7169-c561-47a3-96ff-c5b3354f56d1-2
00:32:43.608 --> 00:32:47.352
on the right side, you can see
presumably another side of the

c5ad7169-c561-47a3-96ff-c5b3354f56d1-3
00:32:47.352 --> 00:32:51.096
underpass, the archway. There's
another statue on our side of

c5ad7169-c561-47a3-96ff-c5b3354f56d1-4
00:32:51.096 --> 00:32:53.270
the underpass, and it is a
mermaid.

f161c97e-f5aa-4eec-a02c-9dccf25deece-0
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.066
Alright, so on the left side
there is where those wooden

f161c97e-f5aa-4eec-a02c-9dccf25deece-1
00:32:59.066 --> 00:33:02.643
doors were under the underpass
and there's a guy who comes out,

f161c97e-f5aa-4eec-a02c-9dccf25deece-2
00:33:02.643 --> 00:33:05.941
looks like he has like a crown
on his head and he has some

f161c97e-f5aa-4eec-a02c-9dccf25deece-3
00:33:05.941 --> 00:33:09.463
brown and orange like clothing
on. It's kind of baggy and it's

f161c97e-f5aa-4eec-a02c-9dccf25deece-4
00:33:09.463 --> 00:33:10.190
like a dress.

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-0
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:15.052
Something other shoulders too.
And then that he's holding a

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-1
00:33:15.052 --> 00:33:18.589
piece of paper that has a ring
with green, blue, purple, red,

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-2
00:33:18.589 --> 00:33:22.354
orange and yellow circles around
that ring and it looks like it's

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-3
00:33:22.354 --> 00:33:25.720
he's startling the kids when he
comes out and he's has his

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-4
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.200
finger over his mouth as his to
shush them. And then there's

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-5
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.794
this purple what it looked like,
I thought was graffiti on the

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-6
00:33:32.794 --> 00:33:36.331
wall before. Now it's like this
purple winged creature with a

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-7
00:33:36.331 --> 00:33:39.868
really long tail that's up in
the air above the kids and then

5a478007-893e-46ac-939f-c098a8a9b40d-8
00:33:39.868 --> 00:33:41.580
on the right side you can see.

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-0
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.423
There's the guy, or it's called
the king for now. So then the

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-1
00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:49.258
king has the two guys and the
two kids sitting next to him. He

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-2
00:33:49.258 --> 00:33:53.092
put something over the one kid's
shoulder, like on a diagonal.

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-3
00:33:53.092 --> 00:33:56.744
And then he has the other kid
holding a piece of paper. And

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-4
00:33:56.744 --> 00:34:00.518
then below that you'll see that
there's two like armed guards

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-5
00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:04.475
who come out and they have like
swords that they go and grab the

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-6
00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:08.431
king. And then the two kids are
still outside. One has the paper

ece906e6-483d-42fd-870d-e6e3bdc5b819-7
00:34:08.431 --> 00:34:11.839
and his hands and that purple
creature is flying above.

3ce55432-2d3b-465f-b3da-98fc5a782697-0
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.248
And then it shows. Then the
third part of that picture, it

3ce55432-2d3b-465f-b3da-98fc5a782697-1
00:34:15.248 --> 00:34:18.116
shows that the two guards are
bringing that king back through

3ce55432-2d3b-465f-b3da-98fc5a782697-2
00:34:18.116 --> 00:34:20.290
the door, and then the kids are
still outside.

b85ea3f2-79c7-475e-b4bb-b6c185f717d2-0
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.602
Umm, so the kids are standing
outside that closed wooden door

b85ea3f2-79c7-475e-b4bb-b6c185f717d2-1
00:34:26.602 --> 00:34:30.254
now where the king and the
guards went back in and and then

b85ea3f2-79c7-475e-b4bb-b6c185f717d2-2
00:34:30.254 --> 00:34:34.148
on the right side it looks like
there's a three-part picture in

b85ea3f2-79c7-475e-b4bb-b6c185f717d2-3
00:34:34.148 --> 00:34:34.940
the top left.

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-0
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.521
It looks like they're, they made
keys out of the purple and red

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-1
00:34:39.521 --> 00:34:42.354
things that they had in their
hands and then that purple

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-2
00:34:42.354 --> 00:34:45.436
creature still kind of flying
above them. And then the second

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-3
00:34:45.436 --> 00:34:48.418
part of the picture you can see
that they have keys and the

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-4
00:34:48.418 --> 00:34:51.649
purple creatures on the the feet
of their, I mean at their feet.

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-5
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:54.880
And then they use those keys in
the bottom right, the third part

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-6
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.962
of the picture to open the doors
and they go, they're running

0791f06a-9fc5-4e42-8a4d-20982417a1e5-7
00:34:57.962 --> 00:35:00.150
inside with the purple creature
above them.

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-0
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.977
Uh, looks like now that they're
inside. They went through that

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-1
00:35:06.977 --> 00:35:10.803
door, they came out the other
side and it's like a old little

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-2
00:35:10.803 --> 00:35:14.505
different world with a a Moat
and then there's a big castle

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-3
00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:17.837
and then there's like a
waterfall right, right at the

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-4
00:35:17.837 --> 00:35:21.539
entrance of the door they came
out of where they're kind of

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-5
00:35:21.539 --> 00:35:25.365
hiding underneath a rock. And up
in the sky there are some, I

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-6
00:35:25.365 --> 00:35:28.820
don't know, raft type boats or
you know, they have like

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-7
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.523
something that there are a
couple of people are sitting on,

9af15bec-eed5-4f9e-8ca4-a87dbbff5a8d-8
00:35:32.523 --> 00:35:32.770
but.

45facde2-d18e-4c22-9f1b-aa49fd71678b-0
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.531
And there's something that it's
like oblong above it on this,

45facde2-d18e-4c22-9f1b-aa49fd71678b-1
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:40.342
like inflated that's keeping the
boats in the air or something.

45facde2-d18e-4c22-9f1b-aa49fd71678b-2
00:35:40.342 --> 00:35:43.379
And then in the background
you'll see there's some

45facde2-d18e-4c22-9f1b-aa49fd71678b-3
00:35:43.379 --> 00:35:44.569
mountains with snow.

0e02e4cb-a5d1-4afc-80e1-d3a3fbb58045-0
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.520
But the Castle itself has lots
of.

93ea1632-fe29-4055-9288-1a2e551a7cac-0
00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.709
Torts and other there's an
archway, and then underneath the

93ea1632-fe29-4055-9288-1a2e551a7cac-1
00:35:52.709 --> 00:35:56.059
archway there's like this water
boat that has the king and the

93ea1632-fe29-4055-9288-1a2e551a7cac-2
00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:58.770
armed guards and looks like
they're taking them in

93ea1632-fe29-4055-9288-1a2e551a7cac-3
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.099
underneath the underpass.

dc68e24c-9579-42bc-9f25-6a5e8ea79063-0
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.931
This picture it shows the kids
pointing  to the piece of paper

dc68e24c-9579-42bc-9f25-6a5e8ea79063-1
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:10.397
with the ring that the king had
given them and they're pointing

dc68e24c-9579-42bc-9f25-6a5e8ea79063-2
00:36:10.397 --> 00:36:13.646
to the yellow circle. On the
yellow circle has on the right

dc68e24c-9579-42bc-9f25-6a5e8ea79063-3
00:36:13.646 --> 00:36:16.841
side you see more up close
picture of the map and then the

dc68e24c-9579-42bc-9f25-6a5e8ea79063-4
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:20.252
yellow circle has looks like a
picture of a building with some

dc68e24c-9579-42bc-9f25-6a5e8ea79063-5
00:36:20.252 --> 00:36:21.390
grass in front of it.

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-0
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.762
The orange circle to the left of
that has like a picture of the

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-1
00:36:26.762 --> 00:36:30.540
castle itself, and to underneath
that the red circle, and it

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-2
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.565
shows more of a doorway with two
lanterns on either side. To the

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-3
00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:38.651
right of that on the circle is a
purple circle, and it has a palm

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-4
00:36:38.651 --> 00:36:42.491
tree. To the right of that more
like 3:00 o'clock. Now of the

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-5
00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:46.330
circle it's a blue circle that
has a snowy mountain, and then

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-6
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:50.169
above that on the circle is a
small green circle and that has

2ce3e865-771c-4cc2-a582-1768e76ebc38-7
00:36:50.169 --> 00:36:52.769
like a part of a suspension
bridge maybe.

e8ffb4bc-5079-4309-b97a-9fdff1930b19-0
00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.280
That's about 1:00 o'clock on the
circle.

281dc5f3-2905-4095-9efe-6355d4224248-0
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.310
And then going back to the left
side. {Sorry.}

f80fd4e7-8956-4f35-b2e3-3f2c467f91d1-0
00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.716
I was just gonna say and left
side picture, you can just see

f80fd4e7-8956-4f35-b2e3-3f2c467f91d1-1
00:37:01.716 --> 00:37:03.980
that they're just looking
through the archway from a

f80fd4e7-8956-4f35-b2e3-3f2c467f91d1-2
00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.800
different angle and they can see
that picking on that little boat

f80fd4e7-8956-4f35-b2e3-3f2c467f91d1-3
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.040
going underneath it actually.

11110d56-c63c-45c3-b645-1928f509d12a-0
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.873
Um, so now it shows the kids are
hiding by rock, and there's a

11110d56-c63c-45c3-b645-1928f509d12a-1
00:37:16.873 --> 00:37:20.363
couple smaller boats with a
bunch of armed guards on it, and

11110d56-c63c-45c3-b645-1928f509d12a-2
00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:23.681
you can see also some fire
coming from different parts of

11110d56-c63c-45c3-b645-1928f509d12a-3
00:37:23.681 --> 00:37:25.340
the castle in the background.

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-0
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.831
And on the right side you can
see the three-part picture. The

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-1
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:33.388
top is the two boys they have
that one has a red thing in

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-2
00:37:33.388 --> 00:37:36.944
their hand, one has a purple
thing in their hand and that

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-3
00:37:36.944 --> 00:37:40.869
purple creature is just kind of
hanging out with them the whole

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-4
00:37:40.869 --> 00:37:44.732
time. And the second part of the
picture they guy with the red

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-5
00:37:44.732 --> 00:37:48.472
draws like little like flippers
for their feet and something

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-6
00:37:48.472 --> 00:37:52.152
also in the air like a little
circle. And then the kid with

0087ef92-89b0-4f04-8f3f-3711672b4d35-7
00:37:52.152 --> 00:37:55.770
the purple kind of creates
almost like looks like octopus.

dd12a0b5-72f0-4e90-920c-487a17ae7ca2-0
00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.240
legs

2a24cb89-de9f-4e98-ab51-1a37be8409b2-0
00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.027
And then the bottom right you
just see the flipper feet. So

2a24cb89-de9f-4e98-ab51-1a37be8409b2-1
00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:03.219
there's two sets of flipper feet
and the little purple creatures

2a24cb89-de9f-4e98-ab51-1a37be8409b2-2
00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:04.890
tail and then these octopus
legs.

851ce531-a115-496b-9fa3-2fe11bf26b3b-0
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.607
So then you see looks like
they're gone underwater and you

851ce531-a115-496b-9fa3-2fe11bf26b3b-1
00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:15.406
can see that they have a flipper
feet, but then they also have

851ce531-a115-496b-9fa3-2fe11bf26b3b-2
00:38:15.406 --> 00:38:18.180
almost like like a little oxygen
helmet mask.

9b43b819-9ae9-4489-9153-664ca7748b11-0
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.600
And then you can see they're
following this big octopus that

9b43b819-9ae9-4489-9153-664ca7748b11-1
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.853
looks like the purple creature
turned into the big octopus. But

9b43b819-9ae9-4489-9153-664ca7748b11-2
00:38:25.853 --> 00:38:29.156
then there's also or maybe they
just made an octopus type thing,

9b43b819-9ae9-4489-9153-664ca7748b11-3
00:38:29.156 --> 00:38:32.104
because then there's a small
purple creature still on the

9b43b819-9ae9-4489-9153-664ca7748b11-4
00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:34.697
left also has like a weird
little oxygen mask, and

9b43b819-9ae9-4489-9153-664ca7748b11-5
00:38:34.697 --> 00:38:37.340
underneath you can see there's
like a big circular.

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-0
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.660
Structure with bunch of tiny
arches in it and it's like a

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-1
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.200
there's another ring of that
same circular structure with

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-2
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.740
tiny arches in it. They get
double wall and then there is

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-3
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.707
looks like almost like a little
Parthenon with a bunch of lights

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-4
00:38:52.707 --> 00:38:56.675
down there and is that like the
bottom And then it's on. There's

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-5
00:38:56.675 --> 00:39:00.276
some other fish and things
flying in the water or swimming

44569150-c5a3-4139-a98b-b64523c69648-6
00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:01.070
in the water.

e44e8b17-bb0d-46bf-b22e-8c2a53a07357-0
00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.832
So on the left, you see the two
kids they go to looks like a

e44e8b17-bb0d-46bf-b22e-8c2a53a07357-1
00:39:08.832 --> 00:39:12.132
little statue, like a seahorse
statue, and they're putting

e44e8b17-bb0d-46bf-b22e-8c2a53a07357-2
00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:15.376
something at the top and it's
the, it's lit up at the top

e44e8b17-bb0d-46bf-b22e-8c2a53a07357-3
00:39:15.376 --> 00:39:18.564
there. And around them you can
see these different stone

e44e8b17-bb0d-46bf-b22e-8c2a53a07357-4
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:22.144
pillars and there's like mermaid
statues and there's a bunch of

e44e8b17-bb0d-46bf-b22e-8c2a53a07357-5
00:39:22.144 --> 00:39:24.549
like coral and other things on
the ground.

2aeb560c-35ff-42ab-8272-6bb11d65ff8c-0
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.146
And then on the right side of
the picture, you can see there's

2aeb560c-35ff-42ab-8272-6bb11d65ff8c-1
00:39:29.146 --> 00:39:31.999
like the armed guards that they
now also have flippers and

2aeb560c-35ff-42ab-8272-6bb11d65ff8c-2
00:39:31.999 --> 00:39:34.851
there's an armed guard with gold
and towards the front and

2aeb560c-35ff-42ab-8272-6bb11d65ff8c-3
00:39:34.851 --> 00:39:37.607
they're pointing towards the
boys. And then they are now

2aeb560c-35ff-42ab-8272-6bb11d65ff8c-4
00:39:37.607 --> 00:39:40.654
swimming away and they have that
map in their hand and they're

2aeb560c-35ff-42ab-8272-6bb11d65ff8c-5
00:39:40.654 --> 00:39:42.830
holding on to some of the
octopus tentacles.

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-0
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:49.038
Then it shows the boys they were
getting out of the water onto

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-1
00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:52.433
like a grassy area with a bunch
of palm trees and that purple

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-2
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:55.882
creature still above them. And
then there's like clouds in the

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-3
00:39:55.882 --> 00:39:59.330
mountains in the background. And
then on the right side of the

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-4
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.725
picture, they're again using
that purple and red markers that

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-5
00:40:02.725 --> 00:40:05.955
they have to make something else
looks like they're making

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-6
00:40:05.955 --> 00:40:09.184
something that's arched. And
then the one boy is on top of

72a1c748-e89e-46ec-8d9f-2cfd17459391-7
00:40:09.184 --> 00:40:11.320
the arch and he's making a Red
Square.

65ea6963-5208-4f1b-b9d9-853fbe665ebf-0
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.966
So it looks like what they made
was a rhinoceros was to the

65ea6963-5208-4f1b-b9d9-853fbe665ebf-1
00:40:17.966 --> 00:40:21.664
purple thing and then the Red
Square turned into like almost

65ea6963-5208-4f1b-b9d9-853fbe665ebf-2
00:40:21.664 --> 00:40:23.240
like a saddle that it has.

de5571ba-51e3-498d-94e5-d5ae9f1107f6-0
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.214
Like the little tent above it.
So they're riding the rhinoceros

de5571ba-51e3-498d-94e5-d5ae9f1107f6-1
00:40:28.214 --> 00:40:31.698
and they're writing a rhinoceros
now through this forested area

de5571ba-51e3-498d-94e5-d5ae9f1107f6-2
00:40:31.698 --> 00:40:35.073
there's on, they're on a little
trail, there's two big statue

de5571ba-51e3-498d-94e5-d5ae9f1107f6-3
00:40:35.073 --> 00:40:38.612
figurines that they're about to
walk through lots of palm trees,

de5571ba-51e3-498d-94e5-d5ae9f1107f6-4
00:40:38.612 --> 00:40:41.661
up to grass, and then you see
some like pyramids in the

de5571ba-51e3-498d-94e5-d5ae9f1107f6-5
00:40:41.661 --> 00:40:42.260
background.

ac8a241f-7686-4ab3-a22c-04dfad14bbb6-0
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.312
stone pyramids, then they are
kinda on a mountain because if

ac8a241f-7686-4ab3-a22c-04dfad14bbb6-1
00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:46.090
you look below there is a
waterfall and beach line and

ac8a241f-7686-4ab3-a22c-04dfad14bbb6-2
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.062
then there's the water going
there, and then the background.

ac8a241f-7686-4ab3-a22c-04dfad14bbb6-3
00:40:48.062 --> 00:40:50.196
You can see like a statue in the
middle of the water as well, and

ac8a241f-7686-4ab3-a22c-04dfad14bbb6-4
00:40:50.196 --> 00:40:52.039
it has like orange towards the
top of it, like a temple.

03e6caac-1999-49cd-a013-4a6b6b9f7498-0
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.770
And then it looks like they're
on a suspension bridge to get to

03e6caac-1999-49cd-a013-4a6b6b9f7498-1
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.930
that structure that was in the
middle of the water and they get

03e6caac-1999-49cd-a013-4a6b6b9f7498-2
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.510
to the top of it. Well, they're.

82781a11-0f5d-4e85-bbf3-b4bc2465737e-0
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.926
You're on suspension bridge, but
towards the top of that

82781a11-0f5d-4e85-bbf3-b4bc2465737e-1
00:41:04.926 --> 00:41:07.040
structure that's in the water is
a big green light.

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-0
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.286
So now they're at the top of
that structure where the big

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-1
00:41:14.286 --> 00:41:17.585
green light was, and then
there's the armed guards that

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-2
00:41:17.585 --> 00:41:21.237
are on this suspension bridge
coming after them, and then the

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-3
00:41:21.237 --> 00:41:24.889
purple creature still hanging
above them. And then now on the

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-4
00:41:24.889 --> 00:41:28.247
right side of the picture
they're using those purple and

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-5
00:41:28.247 --> 00:41:32.134
red markers to draw more things.
So the kid on the left is on the

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-6
00:41:32.134 --> 00:41:35.669
ground drawing 3 dimensional
like rectangle and then like a

a6116086-b227-44a1-89b4-f91b6a1c2cc5-7
00:41:35.669 --> 00:41:38.850
plank. And then the guy on the
right is drawing four.

4c753cee-a48e-4c93-8803-efc078ebef1c-0
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.545
Oval type structures unless
looks like maybe like wings or

4c753cee-a48e-4c93-8803-efc078ebef1c-1
00:41:42.545 --> 00:41:43.040
something.

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-0
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.543
Umm so yeah, it looks like he
drew almost looks like a big

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-1
00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:51.654
dragonfly. It's a purple
structure and then the red ended

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-2
00:41:51.654 --> 00:41:54.657
up being like a wooden plank
swing with like 2 ropes to

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-3
00:41:54.657 --> 00:41:57.928
hanging onto the big dragonfly.
So then they use that to get

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-4
00:41:57.928 --> 00:42:01.199
away from the armed guards who
are now at the tip top of the

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-5
00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:04.632
temple and trying to grab their
feet. In the background you see

96c31a46-aed0-4f44-92f7-a04f8bee145b-6
00:42:04.632 --> 00:42:06.080
a bunch of snowy mountains.

e187b3e7-ad47-48a1-afc5-43d2e1156025-0
00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:12.329
Um, so now they're on top of a
different temple and must looks

e187b3e7-ad47-48a1-afc5-43d2e1156025-1
00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:15.331
like a little Buddha like
underneath with some hanging

e187b3e7-ad47-48a1-afc5-43d2e1156025-2
00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:16.860
lanterns part of the temple.

3910641e-35b1-4397-aca0-258ead5d4ed9-0
00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.843
The dragonfly finally drops them
off there, and that other little

3910641e-35b1-4397-aca0-258ead5d4ed9-1
00:42:20.843 --> 00:42:22.360
purple creatures there too, at
the top.

edf8b75b-962e-4b80-8f8c-8a2af73539b1-0
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.030
And then the other kid pulls out
the.

112feace-4c05-40cf-b253-40bf8e12512a-0
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.384
The diagonal thing that the king
had put around his shoulder and

112feace-4c05-40cf-b253-40bf8e12512a-1
00:42:30.384 --> 00:42:30.590
has.

0ee3c53a-52b8-47fb-884e-9b60d9d005bf-0
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.564
Six different marker colors.
They're purple, teal, light

0ee3c53a-52b8-47fb-884e-9b60d9d005bf-1
00:42:35.564 --> 00:42:38.943
green, yellow, orange and red,
and they're both looking at

0ee3c53a-52b8-47fb-884e-9b60d9d005bf-2
00:42:38.943 --> 00:42:39.230
that.

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-0
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.094
So they're still at the top of
that and then it looks like the

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-1
00:42:47.094 --> 00:42:50.317
purple creature now has a little
like a rainbow assortment of

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-2
00:42:50.317 --> 00:42:53.592
colors like at this feet. So I
don't know if he had held on to

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-3
00:42:53.592 --> 00:42:56.711
something there. But then you'll
see the two like boat type

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-4
00:42:56.711 --> 00:42:59.986
things in the air and the armed
guards are trying to reach for

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-5
00:42:59.986 --> 00:43:03.001
the purple creature in those
colors and then on the right

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-6
00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:06.380
side of the picture you see more
of the armed guards and like in

d90f48f8-a06e-4630-b1e3-0e0e177473bc-7
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.200
those boat type things in the
air.

8a8eecdd-58c5-4350-9ad6-4e12cf23710b-0
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.772
So it looks like the purple
creature then used that belt of

8a8eecdd-58c5-4350-9ad6-4e12cf23710b-1
00:43:15.772 --> 00:43:19.433
different colors to make a
rainbow from the point of where

8a8eecdd-58c5-4350-9ad6-4e12cf23710b-2
00:43:19.433 --> 00:43:22.659
the boys were at the top of that
temple to mid air.

2e2a3e9c-db83-42fd-bb82-35d2148d530d-0
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.325
And then it looks like it's
really bright because some of

2e2a3e9c-db83-42fd-bb82-35d2148d530d-1
00:43:27.325 --> 00:43:30.611
the armed guards on the left are
like covering their eyes from

2e2a3e9c-db83-42fd-bb82-35d2148d530d-2
00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:33.688
it. And you'll see it's also
like throwing off some of the

2e2a3e9c-db83-42fd-bb82-35d2148d530d-3
00:43:33.688 --> 00:43:36.870
other guards from their boats on
the other boats in the air.

6abc4666-b05f-4232-8cd9-f959542198da-0
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.933
Looks like the rainbow goes all
the way down from that temple

6abc4666-b05f-4232-8cd9-f959542198da-1
00:43:43.933 --> 00:43:47.208
down to the boat in the water
that we originally saw where the

6abc4666-b05f-4232-8cd9-f959542198da-2
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.820
king was with the armed guards.

0e9ce426-66b0-417e-8cd4-1fcbc1538497-0
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.488
And it looks like it knocks all
the guards off, or it's really

0e9ce426-66b0-417e-8cd4-1fcbc1538497-1
00:43:53.488 --> 00:43:56.676
bright and throws them off and
then the king is has his hands

0e9ce426-66b0-417e-8cd4-1fcbc1538497-2
00:43:56.676 --> 00:43:58.990
up in the air if he's happy
about something.

22a10b56-d978-4c9a-81f7-75d8fd975e5c-0
00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.538
And then you have a picture of
like the whole castle  area is

22a10b56-d978-4c9a-81f7-75d8fd975e5c-1
00:44:06.538 --> 00:44:09.751
not like an overshadowed in
rainbow colors. You see the

22a10b56-d978-4c9a-81f7-75d8fd975e5c-2
00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:11.990
dragonfly type figure at the top
left.

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-0
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.478
And then we'll see. It's, I
think there's still in the water

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-1
00:44:16.478 --> 00:44:19.749
because there's much smaller
boats and there are some guards.

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-2
00:44:19.749 --> 00:44:23.074
You see the octopus legs from
the water you see on this like a

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-3
00:44:23.074 --> 00:44:26.398
band on one of the boats. And
then you'll see the main boat on

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-4
00:44:26.398 --> 00:44:29.669
the right has the king and the
two boys on top of that purple

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-5
00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:32.888
rhinoceros with that red tent
over the two boys. And they're

e130ad84-0275-4307-b24d-fe7c9286dfbb-6
00:44:32.888 --> 00:44:35.790
on that boat and they look
happy. The king is waiting.

0d8062c5-1083-4416-a6e6-d59c9e553687-0
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.811
Um, so then it shows the
rhinoceros and the boat going

0d8062c5-1083-4416-a6e6-d59c9e553687-1
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:46.532
back to the First rock where the
guys, the boys first came out of

0d8062c5-1083-4416-a6e6-d59c9e553687-2
00:44:46.532 --> 00:44:49.915
that door by the and they went
through that underpass area.

0d8062c5-1083-4416-a6e6-d59c9e553687-3
00:44:49.915 --> 00:44:53.355
Some the boys were getting off
the rhinoceros and the King's

0d8062c5-1083-4416-a6e6-d59c9e553687-4
00:44:53.355 --> 00:44:55.780
helping them down some stairs
and you see.

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-0
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.422
a dragonfly still in the sky and
you see the little tentacle of

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-1
00:45:00.422 --> 00:45:03.140
the octopus on the bottom, and
then on the right side of the

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-2
00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.725
page there's a three-part
picture. There's one looks like

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-3
00:45:05.725 --> 00:45:08.443
the king is pointing something
towards the two boys and they

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-4
00:45:08.443 --> 00:45:11.028
have that purple creature and
one of their shoulders. The

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-5
00:45:11.028 --> 00:45:13.746
second part of the picture looks
like that with the king was

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-6
00:45:13.746 --> 00:45:16.465
pointing, was drawing a crown
and you put a crown on the one

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-7
00:45:16.465 --> 00:45:19.317
kid. And then the third part of
the picture you see the both of

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-8
00:45:19.317 --> 00:45:22.214
the kids have crowns on and then
they're waving to them and then

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-9
00:45:22.214 --> 00:45:24.932
they're going back through the
doorway and the king has both

fa9aa55b-07e8-4dd1-9bf2-dc68a2ddf5ff-10
00:45:24.932 --> 00:45:27.249
hands in front of his face as if
he's thanking them

42ab77df-ca9a-4996-be7b-f839039de22c-0
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.584
And then the two boys, you see
them from a back angle. They've

42ab77df-ca9a-4996-be7b-f839039de22c-1
00:45:33.584 --> 00:45:37.328
come back out through the doors,
back to where they originally

42ab77df-ca9a-4996-be7b-f839039de22c-2
00:45:37.328 --> 00:45:40.954
were under the underpass. Looks
like it's no longer raining.

42ab77df-ca9a-4996-be7b-f839039de22c-3
00:45:40.954 --> 00:45:44.758
There's a rainbow and you see a
nice like a modern city skyline

42ab77df-ca9a-4996-be7b-f839039de22c-4
00:45:44.758 --> 00:45:47.730
with some trees and some that
post and fence and.

5884b4aa-c853-4b3a-b9c4-b0fbd86a05f7-0
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.350
The purple creatures
above them and they both are

5884b4aa-c853-4b3a-b9c4-b0fbd86a05f7-1
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.921
still wearing their crowns. #END_quest 
Alright, so that was the story,

5884b4aa-c853-4b3a-b9c4-b0fbd86a05f7-2
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:56.160
OK?

3a028e92-4bd9-4ab8-9b05-20c60852cdbc-0
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.360
Now we're going back to a
complex scene.

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-0
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.080
#START_make_a_splash OK, so this
one called making a splash, so

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-1
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.600
it looks like it's a water park.
The top left, there's a couple

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-2
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.900
tubular slides or inclosed
slides I should say. And there's

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-3
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.760
green, yellow and red and
there's an open sections,

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-4
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.335
there's some closed sections to
each of them and there's a bunch

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-5
00:46:20.335 --> 00:46:23.800
of people going up and down the
slides, some of their bellies,

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-6
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.430
some on their backs and and then
there's a bunch of people at the

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-7
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:31.060
top of that and then towards the
bottom. Then it goes into like a

e7378eb0-dd2a-4994-a451-4708d3578985-8
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.920
pool area where there's some
people in inner tubes.

54ca00bf-2904-4edd-83b3-bfb52761da5e-0
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:35.280
There's people walking around.

3bc86313-e7de-4e23-acb4-0d22e00a13cb-0
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.491
On the bottom left is almost
like a lazy river. There's a

3bc86313-e7de-4e23-acb4-0d22e00a13cb-1
00:46:39.491 --> 00:46:43.294
bunch of people on inner tubes.
I mean, yeah, inner tubes. And

3bc86313-e7de-4e23-acb4-0d22e00a13cb-2
00:46:43.294 --> 00:46:46.977
then there's like a big pink
elephant statue where there's a

3bc86313-e7de-4e23-acb4-0d22e00a13cb-3
00:46:46.977 --> 00:46:50.660
kid climbing on it. There's a
lifeguard on a lifeguard bench

3bc86313-e7de-4e23-acb4-0d22e00a13cb-4
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.230
with an umbrella over her.

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-0
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.488
There's under over the lazy
river. There's like a little

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-1
00:46:56.488 --> 00:46:59.489
arched bridge and there's
somebody with a water gun

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-2
00:46:59.489 --> 00:47:02.893
spraying somebody on one of the
inner tubes on the bottom,

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-3
00:47:02.893 --> 00:47:06.413
bottom left, and there is just a
little patch of grass where

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-4
00:47:06.413 --> 00:47:09.759
there's some people laying out
in towels on their bathing

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-5
00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:13.221
suits. There's a sidewalk going
around the lazy river where

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-6
00:47:13.221 --> 00:47:16.799
there's people walking, and that
also leads to the other side

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-7
00:47:16.799 --> 00:47:20.549
when there's like another water
section, there's like a snake in

7b9812a5-c6b9-4815-a5a9-30aeceb30aec-8
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:22.800
the water that people are
climbing on.

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-0
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.575
There's a red and white and a
green and white big ball and it

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-1
00:47:26.575 --> 00:47:29.850
looks like there might be water
coming out of the some of the

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-2
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.126
white spots or the holes in the
balls and the water. Maybe it

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-3
00:47:33.126 --> 00:47:35.767
looks like they're like
umbrellas or mushrooms if

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-4
00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:39.096
there's water coming out of and
there's people underneath them

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-5
00:47:39.096 --> 00:47:42.213
and then right above that. So
the right center of the page

20e5c0d9-b9ab-43a3-9059-5d45b0509d90-6
00:47:42.213 --> 00:47:42.900
there is 123.

9eb2a733-e793-499e-84c5-6811391d776a-0
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:48.360
Six open slides, their rainbow
colors are red, orange, yellow,

9eb2a733-e793-499e-84c5-6811391d776a-1
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.373
green, blue, purple and there's
people sliding down those sides

9eb2a733-e793-499e-84c5-6811391d776a-2
00:47:52.373 --> 00:47:56.260
and and then next to that, so
back into the water above where

9eb2a733-e793-499e-84c5-6811391d776a-3
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.960
the snake was is there's a
couple brown discs in the water

9eb2a733-e793-499e-84c5-6811391d776a-4
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.847
and looks like there's people
trying to balance on them going

9eb2a733-e793-499e-84c5-6811391d776a-5
00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:04.600
across them.

2f2cbd30-c84a-47b8-90a7-56969f55f788-0
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.329
Above that it's like a red
dragon. It's water coming out of

2f2cbd30-c84a-47b8-90a7-56969f55f788-1
00:48:09.329 --> 00:48:12.570
its mouth, and that's a
structure in the water. And

2f2cbd30-c84a-47b8-90a7-56969f55f788-2
00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:16.310
above that is like a boat or a
ship has a wide yellow slide

2f2cbd30-c84a-47b8-90a7-56969f55f788-3
00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.987
where there's some people
sliding down and there's a bunch

2f2cbd30-c84a-47b8-90a7-56969f55f788-4
00:48:19.987 --> 00:48:23.539
of people on the ship itself. On
the ship there is like.

15058eb1-0cba-4379-9a86-2303c7ae5bb3-0
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.330
cannons but the cans were blown
out. Water, people.

927c098c-46d2-4bdd-819e-21465d396b18-0
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.191
And there's
some people in inner tubes on

927c098c-46d2-4bdd-819e-21465d396b18-1
00:48:31.191 --> 00:48:34.002
the other side of the ship.
Looks like it's part of the Lazy

927c098c-46d2-4bdd-819e-21465d396b18-2
00:48:34.002 --> 00:48:36.952
River. It continues all the way
at the top of the screen and it

927c098c-46d2-4bdd-819e-21465d396b18-3
00:48:36.952 --> 00:48:39.810
goes down to the bottom left,
underneath the enclosed slides. #END_make_a_splash 

453e9c51-9df0-4b71-aaf7-6b71c4ea08e7-0
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.570
All right, that was about 3
minutes.

9ced38f2-9c4d-4f4f-b06a-cd45f6abc7f8-0
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:50.370
Then going back to a graphic
novel, it has 2 pages.

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-0
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.644
#START_arrival_3 OK, so for this
one looks like it's a layout of

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-1
00:48:57.644 --> 00:49:00.982
four pictures or maybe 8
pictures. So the top left

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-2
00:49:00.982 --> 00:49:05.106
there's a kid holding a piece of
paper, different language and

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-3
00:49:05.106 --> 00:49:09.034
then he has something also
rolled up under his arm and he's

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-4
00:49:09.034 --> 00:49:13.092
wearing like a jacket, shoes, a
hat and he's on a sidewalk or

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-5
00:49:13.092 --> 00:49:17.019
some other people standing
around him also or in the jacket

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-6
00:49:17.019 --> 00:49:20.881
hat next to him is a picture of
a woman holding a cat type

99c61e40-6ee0-4b89-ad06-9da389169430-7
00:49:20.881 --> 00:49:21.340
figure.

8914bed4-c32a-48c5-9692-a9cda5a2c94c-0
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.558
She's in a dress, she has dark
hair and there's also another

8914bed4-c32a-48c5-9692-a9cda5a2c94c-1
00:49:24.558 --> 00:49:25.470
woman next to her.

61b35711-faca-4305-b24a-98351aa0f664-0
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.690
And then the picture next to
that.

7c756a48-5d01-4aa4-9620-821692404492-0
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:35.047
Is to the right of that is a man
looks like almost like a Barber

7c756a48-5d01-4aa4-9620-821692404492-1
00:49:35.047 --> 00:49:38.513
situation and the kid or the
person that he's you know

7c756a48-5d01-4aa4-9620-821692404492-2
00:49:38.513 --> 00:49:42.295
attending to has like one of
those Barber like a bibs on or

7c756a48-5d01-4aa4-9620-821692404492-3
00:49:42.295 --> 00:49:46.014
around pop around him and
there's a kid next standing next

7c756a48-5d01-4aa4-9620-821692404492-4
00:49:46.014 --> 00:49:49.733
to them on the ground. There's a
bunch of these snail type

7c756a48-5d01-4aa4-9620-821692404492-5
00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:51.939
creatures to the right of that
is.

0cd8f50a-3bda-4d1e-b3c3-04d3953546d5-0
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.047
Some musicians, the ones playing
an instrument also looks like an

0cd8f50a-3bda-4d1e-b3c3-04d3953546d5-1
00:49:57.047 --> 00:50:00.057
accordion at the bottom, but
then it has a big role like a

0cd8f50a-3bda-4d1e-b3c3-04d3953546d5-2
00:50:00.057 --> 00:50:03.221
tuba part that goes up into the
air and then the other person

0cd8f50a-3bda-4d1e-b3c3-04d3953546d5-3
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:06.180
looks like they're playing like
string instrument, like a

0cd8f50a-3bda-4d1e-b3c3-04d3953546d5-4
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.548
violin, and they have some music
on a stand and there's some bird

0cd8f50a-3bda-4d1e-b3c3-04d3953546d5-5
00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:11.640
type figures on the ground next
to them.

01f7375d-7559-4d70-8ad2-4507af530773-0
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.380
And then the bottom left of the
screen um.

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-0
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.611
It's like there's a guy who has
like a cart and maybe some

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-1
00:50:20.611 --> 00:50:24.717
pulling some things out of the
cart, maybe like a food cart.

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-2
00:50:24.717 --> 00:50:28.958
And then there's still a black
creature that's on the left end

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-3
00:50:28.958 --> 00:50:33.064
of his food cart. Next to them
is under the right of that as

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-4
00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:37.372
two people as a man in a jacket
and shirt and a woman who has a

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-5
00:50:37.372 --> 00:50:41.613
dress on. They're both carrying
these really big eggs that are

b22e7097-3805-443e-9d18-563afce9ee41-6
00:50:41.613 --> 00:50:45.719
like size of their torso So Umm.
And then next to that is a.

3962b56f-4e42-428a-ae90-51663b73768d-0
00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.855
The row of women sitting looks
like they have some kind of

3962b56f-4e42-428a-ae90-51663b73768d-1
00:50:49.855 --> 00:50:53.121
papers across their lap. The one
does, at least the one has like

3962b56f-4e42-428a-ae90-51663b73768d-2
00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:54.730
a rabbit type figure on its lap.

43aaa3de-077a-4b18-b8b9-2964c918ab55-0
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.347
In quite clear what they're
doing, but looks like they're

43aaa3de-077a-4b18-b8b9-2964c918ab55-1
00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:02.572
talking to each other. And then
on the far right is a man who is

43aaa3de-077a-4b18-b8b9-2964c918ab55-2
00:51:02.572 --> 00:51:05.647
holding a suitcase and yet in
suit and shoes, and he's on the

43aaa3de-077a-4b18-b8b9-2964c918ab55-3
00:51:05.647 --> 00:51:08.922
edge of the sidewalk. He's a hat
on. He has his head in his hands

43aaa3de-077a-4b18-b8b9-2964c918ab55-4
00:51:08.922 --> 00:51:10.460
as if he's looking or thinking.

128bbc13-9368-4e31-84a8-645076fd78dc-0
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:17.874
Alright. And then the top left,
there's a guy who has like a

128bbc13-9368-4e31-84a8-645076fd78dc-1
00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:21.349
time piece in his hand and then
he's looking, he's like

128bbc13-9368-4e31-84a8-645076fd78dc-2
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:25.319
concerned and he looks up at the
one building, looks like maybe

128bbc13-9368-4e31-84a8-645076fd78dc-3
00:51:25.319 --> 00:51:28.360
it's supposed to be a big clock
at the building.

4ce8a8f2-438a-427b-b393-b657587f8953-0
00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.217
see him carrying across the
street with his suitcase, and

4ce8a8f2-438a-427b-b393-b657587f8953-1
00:51:32.217 --> 00:51:34.780
there's people around him and
you see him walking on down the

4ce8a8f2-438a-427b-b393-b657587f8953-2
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.384
sidewalk with the suitcase and
then he's walking past somebody

4ce8a8f2-438a-427b-b393-b657587f8953-3
00:51:37.384 --> 00:51:39.947
who's on the ground. Then he's
walking past another building,

4ce8a8f2-438a-427b-b393-b657587f8953-4
00:51:39.947 --> 00:51:40.940
has a bunch of archways.

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-0
00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:45.441
And then you see him look up at
the sky and there's are in the

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-1
00:51:45.441 --> 00:51:49.225
air and there's all these little
right circles, and he's with his

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-2
00:51:49.225 --> 00:51:52.895
one hand on the strip, goes to
grab on the circles. And then in

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-3
00:51:52.895 --> 00:51:56.220
the air there's a bunch of
streaks in the picture and his

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-4
00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.889
hat gets flown off his head. He
goes, bends down to pick up the

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-5
00:51:59.889 --> 00:52:03.386
hat, puts the hat back on his
head, and he sees something on

7d48b5ea-a802-43a6-8d68-7d3ff4a1c400-6
00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:06.540
the ground. It looks like a
bunch of arrows and words.

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-0
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.557
And it's the top right side,
right page. He then pulls out

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-1
00:52:11.557 --> 00:52:14.935
like a book and he's looking at
the ground and he's also

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-2
00:52:14.935 --> 00:52:18.610
talking, looking at the book,
and has a suitcase next to him.

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-3
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:22.226
And then somebody comes over,
you see a hand by his shoulder

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-4
00:52:22.226 --> 00:52:25.723
and he looks up and there's
somebody who's talking to him.

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-5
00:52:25.723 --> 00:52:29.398
He has a hat on. He's a white
dress and white attire as well.

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-6
00:52:29.398 --> 00:52:33.133
And then he talks to the both,
talking to each other, and then

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-7
00:52:33.133 --> 00:52:36.808
the guy in the suits writing
something down and looks like he

0ace1182-4073-41ab-bbdc-bd355e87b90b-8
00:52:36.808 --> 00:52:38.290
draws a picture of a bed.

7a4cc2bc-ef40-4107-a40e-543f189e5d24-0
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:42.153
And then the guy
in the white clothes with his

7a4cc2bc-ef40-4107-a40e-543f189e5d24-1
00:52:42.153 --> 00:52:45.308
finger up in the air as he knows
what he's talking about now. And

7a4cc2bc-ef40-4107-a40e-543f189e5d24-2
00:52:45.308 --> 00:52:48.320
then he looks over your points
and then you see the guy in the

7a4cc2bc-ef40-4107-a40e-543f189e5d24-3
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.283
suit and the suitcase following
the guy in the white. And the

7a4cc2bc-ef40-4107-a40e-543f189e5d24-4
00:52:51.283 --> 00:52:54.199
guy in the white also has a
basket or some kind of animal in

7a4cc2bc-ef40-4107-a40e-543f189e5d24-5
00:52:54.199 --> 00:52:54.630
the back. #END_arrival_3 

90b2e961-9403-4ad0-baf2-cf3661a3b0db-0
00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.430
So that was this part of the
story.

c55984d7-8a70-47aa-934a-24a47577380e-0
00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.880
Here's another part.

02a5ae10-9e04-4f6f-819b-5e6ae8f39c7b-0
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:07.191
#START_arrival_2 OK, so then top
left, you see three women or

02a5ae10-9e04-4f6f-819b-5e6ae8f39c7b-1
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:10.592
three people looks like um with
blankets or you know like a a

02a5ae10-9e04-4f6f-819b-5e6ae8f39c7b-2
00:53:10.592 --> 00:53:13.829
hood over their head and then
some suitcases next to them.

02a5ae10-9e04-4f6f-819b-5e6ae8f39c7b-3
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:17.011
Then you see three guys and
suits with bags and suitcases

02a5ae10-9e04-4f6f-819b-5e6ae8f39c7b-4
00:53:17.011 --> 00:53:20.631
next to them as well. And then a
woman holding child or something

02a5ae10-9e04-4f6f-819b-5e6ae8f39c7b-5
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:21.290
in her arms.

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-0
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:25.596
With the man in the background.
And then you see the man in the

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-1
00:53:25.596 --> 00:53:29.068
suit now sitting on his suitcase
with a book in his hand and make

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-2
00:53:29.068 --> 00:53:32.067
it an upper close picture of
what he's writing. And then

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-3
00:53:32.067 --> 00:53:35.381
looks like he tears out a sheet
of the book. And then he folds

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-4
00:53:35.381 --> 00:53:38.484
up that sheet into a paper
crane. And then the paper crane

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-5
00:53:38.484 --> 00:53:41.746
he has in his hand and looks
like it comes a lot because it's

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-6
00:53:41.746 --> 00:53:45.165
kind of the way it's sitting on
top of his fingers. And he looks

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-7
00:53:45.165 --> 00:53:48.216
back behind himself and looks
like he still has it in his

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-8
00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:51.057
hand. And then you see him
looking left and right and

8bc7506c-c0ac-4bd7-8da0-46b81d9e85fc-9
00:53:51.057 --> 00:53:52.320
looking up and you just.

bde535bf-25dd-4e0f-9cf2-7165979d9162-0
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.124
Covering his eyes from the sun a
little bit while he looks up and

bde535bf-25dd-4e0f-9cf2-7165979d9162-1
00:53:57.124 --> 00:54:00.565
you see in the next picture
there's a ton of those white

bde535bf-25dd-4e0f-9cf2-7165979d9162-2
00:54:00.565 --> 00:54:04.368
paper cranes that maybe flying
in the sky over a boat, and the

bde535bf-25dd-4e0f-9cf2-7165979d9162-3
00:54:04.368 --> 00:54:07.870
boat's full of people and
they're all looking up at them.

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-0
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:15.363
But then you see like the same
kind of angle of the boat

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-1
00:54:15.363 --> 00:54:18.794
because there's the same type of
steam stacks. But now you're

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-2
00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:22.446
seeing a little bit up close and
you see more people work towards

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-3
00:54:22.446 --> 00:54:26.043
the edge of the boat and they're
looking out and they see in the

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-4
00:54:26.043 --> 00:54:29.528
water. There's smaller boats in
the background. There's a city

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-5
00:54:29.528 --> 00:54:32.738
skyline some and there's some
things flying in the air as

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-6
00:54:32.738 --> 00:54:35.892
well. And then on the right
side, you see these two very

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-7
00:54:35.892 --> 00:54:39.267
large or they're figures or
statue that are coming up out of

b498aa2e-c4bb-475a-950b-5309a8acb776-8
00:54:39.267 --> 00:54:42.200
two large boats and they're both
like shaking hands.

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-0
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:46.202
The one guy on the left of the
the big figure has like a animal

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-1
00:54:46.202 --> 00:54:50.043
on his a rabbit with a long tail
in his one arm and the guy on

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-2
00:54:50.043 --> 00:54:53.640
the right who's also they're
shaking hands. The guy on the

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-3
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.481
right has a kind of bird on his
back and they're both on these

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-4
00:54:57.481 --> 00:55:01.261
boat type things and they've got
on the left has suitcase and

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-5
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:05.041
some coffee cup and the mug and
vase and bowl. And the guy on

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-6
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:08.943
the right has like a big basket,
a teapot and like a clone type

c18d7f46-2992-4484-b683-f13663521b28-7
00:55:08.943 --> 00:55:10.589
figure on his boat as well.

c278de6a-a8c2-458b-993d-7291eb2b7fec-0
00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:18.549
On the left you see up close
picture of a front of the boat

c278de6a-a8c2-458b-993d-7291eb2b7fec-1
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:22.047
from like if you're in the water
and you're looking up at it, you

c278de6a-a8c2-458b-993d-7291eb2b7fec-2
00:55:22.047 --> 00:55:25.386
see the I don't know if that's
the bow or whatever, that's the

c278de6a-a8c2-458b-993d-7291eb2b7fec-3
00:55:25.386 --> 00:55:28.460
front of the podence. And then
you see it's a cloudy sky.

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-0
00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:32.643
So on the right
side you see, um, couple people

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-1
00:55:32.643 --> 00:55:35.950
again, there's womans and guys,
and there's a kid. And then

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-2
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:39.203
there's a guy with a white hat
and a megaphone and a white

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-3
00:55:39.203 --> 00:55:42.566
jacket, and he's pointing and
he's saying something into the

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-4
00:55:42.566 --> 00:55:45.929
megaphone. And then you see
they're opening the gates, looks

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-5
00:55:45.929 --> 00:55:49.291
like, of the the boat, and you
see a guy grabbing a suitcase

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-6
00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:52.820
and everybody has their bags in
their hand and they're not just

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-7
00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:56.348
embarking off of the boat. And
now there's a line of people and

950864b8-b188-4951-b008-640aef17aef8-8
00:55:56.348 --> 00:55:59.160
they're about luggage off of the
boat on the dock. #END_arrival_2 

854ac391-4a32-4668-96b8-7e4b68262355-0
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:04.040
Alright, so that was another
part.

d148f106-2c51-494a-b6e5-80cf82d07b9d-0
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:11.680
Continuing with this four page
graphic novel.

d86652e0-047f-4752-86b2-cacddd06ce60-0
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.760
#START_arrival_5 OK, so.

3d945b50-06df-4b92-acb1-5d4eed40383d-0
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:19.832
Now you see on the left is a
large picture. Um, looks like

3d945b50-06df-4b92-acb1-5d4eed40383d-1
00:56:19.832 --> 00:56:22.840
there's water at the very bottom
because there's a little row

3d945b50-06df-4b92-acb1-5d4eed40383d-2
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.042
boat with people in it, and then
there's a dock, but it's kind of

3d945b50-06df-4b92-acb1-5d4eed40383d-3
00:56:26.042 --> 00:56:26.770
like stairs up.

ce30da19-2f6b-4ae2-adf2-9d08fe7f3787-0
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:32.189
Um, and then there's a bunch of
rock type buildings that are

ce30da19-2f6b-4ae2-adf2-9d08fe7f3787-1
00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:34.210
into the the mountainside.

684e6b3d-e2db-47fc-89aa-6c3a37c3f249-0
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.980
And at the very top there's
some.

e14d1d85-cd43-4c54-a950-5ec0c077f794-0
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.388
Look like vases, but they
aren't. I don't know if they're

e14d1d85-cd43-4c54-a950-5ec0c077f794-1
00:56:41.388 --> 00:56:44.178
buildings, but they have like an
owl face on them and then the

e14d1d85-cd43-4c54-a950-5ec0c077f794-2
00:56:44.178 --> 00:56:46.924
one is a really, really large
one at the top and there's lots

e14d1d85-cd43-4c54-a950-5ec0c077f794-3
00:56:46.924 --> 00:56:48.120
of birds flying in the sky.

b7f79984-00d2-4548-bdbf-10b5e54681cb-0
00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.477
And then at the bottom where the
the first stairs start to come

b7f79984-00d2-4548-bdbf-10b5e54681cb-1
00:56:52.477 --> 00:56:55.691
up into the all these buildings,
there's a bunch of row boats

b7f79984-00d2-4548-bdbf-10b5e54681cb-2
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:57.350
that are docked on those stairs.

89373a0a-7307-4af5-815a-64d735bc0ff4-0
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:02.552
And on the right side, you'll
see there's somebody looks like

89373a0a-7307-4af5-815a-64d735bc0ff4-1
00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:03.540
they're tying.

fa2c1680-283e-4249-98d9-e0c55e23eed6-0
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:07.400
Something to have to a figurine
idk if they're tying a boat to

fa2c1680-283e-4249-98d9-e0c55e23eed6-1
00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.178
it or something, and then you
see a guy in a white shirt

fa2c1680-283e-4249-98d9-e0c55e23eed6-2
00:57:10.178 --> 00:57:13.297
pointing towards something and
the guy in the suit, you see the

fa2c1680-283e-4249-98d9-e0c55e23eed6-3
00:57:13.297 --> 00:57:15.539
back of it and they're talking
to each other.

1f764d3b-a570-4c03-8a31-d6d4ce110a57-0
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.328
Then you see a little boy
carrying something with a white

1f764d3b-a570-4c03-8a31-d6d4ce110a57-1
00:57:19.328 --> 00:57:22.672
little fish type thing and a
black little cat type thing next

1f764d3b-a570-4c03-8a31-d6d4ce110a57-2
00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:23.050
to him.

767abfd1-f632-4ebb-81d1-d725900755df-0
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:27.710
And then you see the boy
offering a basket of things to a

767abfd1-f632-4ebb-81d1-d725900755df-1
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.384
woman, and you see that cat tail
in the foreground picture, and

767abfd1-f632-4ebb-81d1-d725900755df-2
00:57:31.384 --> 00:57:35.059
you see the woman then embracing
the guy in the white shirt. He

767abfd1-f632-4ebb-81d1-d725900755df-3
00:57:35.059 --> 00:57:36.610
also has a basket of stuff.

9bb3f43b-9ba1-448f-ac04-707cceceb2c7-0
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.232
And then the guy in the suit
takes his hat off as if he's

9bb3f43b-9ba1-448f-ac04-707cceceb2c7-1
00:57:40.232 --> 00:57:43.367
greeting the woman in the white
dress and then the guy in the

9bb3f43b-9ba1-448f-ac04-707cceceb2c7-2
00:57:43.367 --> 00:57:45.390
white shirt that he already met
before.

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-0
00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:49.584
And then the woman, the dress is
like kind of waving her arms in.

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-1
00:57:49.584 --> 00:57:52.779
They like to bring them inside
and they all have a glass of

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-2
00:57:52.779 --> 00:57:56.080
something to drink and they'll
have their hands together. And

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-3
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.062
then it shows. Looks like
they're pulling things out of

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-4
00:57:59.062 --> 00:58:02.417
that basket and she's chopping,
or somebody's chopping them up

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-5
00:58:02.417 --> 00:58:05.665
and then looks like they're
cooking something and looks like

02be0703-68a5-45ad-870e-e062b669651c-6
00:58:05.665 --> 00:58:07.209
maybe even basting some kind.

1c9271f4-8379-44e4-bc9b-f9777bb786bc-0
00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:13.890
And then they're all sitting at
a table and.

f46c4cef-a3bd-4971-b806-39b5a5566fed-0
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.010
The guy looks like he has one
thing and was like almost like a

f46c4cef-a3bd-4971-b806-39b5a5566fed-1
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:22.381
torch that he's cooking the one
item with it with tongs in the

f46c4cef-a3bd-4971-b806-39b5a5566fed-2
00:58:22.381 --> 00:58:22.969
other hand.

a19b9482-5ca2-4905-808b-0cd04f1f2c73-0
00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:26.991
And then that's the guy in the
white shirt, and then the kids

a19b9482-5ca2-4905-808b-0cd04f1f2c73-1
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:30.547
sitting in a chair and he's kind
of kneeling down, giving food to

a19b9482-5ca2-4905-808b-0cd04f1f2c73-2
00:58:30.547 --> 00:58:33.942
the white fish. That creature
and the black cat creature. They

a19b9482-5ca2-4905-808b-0cd04f1f2c73-3
00:58:33.942 --> 00:58:37.337
were both on the ground. The guy
in the suit is talking to the

a19b9482-5ca2-4905-808b-0cd04f1f2c73-4
00:58:37.337 --> 00:58:40.678
woman in the white dress and
they all have food around tables

a19b9482-5ca2-4905-808b-0cd04f1f2c73-5
00:58:40.678 --> 00:58:40.839
on.

64acbdfa-bd58-43c5-bfb0-5ad4e71b9ab7-0
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.210
Food around on the table with
plates and glasses.

74a22064-7aa5-4f2b-84e8-8e68576c1b65-0
00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.584
And then it shows. The
individuals are laughing and

74a22064-7aa5-4f2b-84e8-8e68576c1b65-1
00:58:47.584 --> 00:58:50.636
talking. The guy in the white
shirt, the woman in the white

74a22064-7aa5-4f2b-84e8-8e68576c1b65-2
00:58:50.636 --> 00:58:53.891
dress, and the guy in the suit,
they all their hands up is that

74a22064-7aa5-4f2b-84e8-8e68576c1b65-3
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:57.044
they're gesturing and talking
and they're eating. And the guy

74a22064-7aa5-4f2b-84e8-8e68576c1b65-4
00:58:57.044 --> 00:59:00.299
in the white shirt also now has
that accordion type instrument.

23a6610c-6445-40c6-8c5a-167190988e95-0
00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:04.816
And she looks like she starts
playing an instrument like most

23a6610c-6445-40c6-8c5a-167190988e95-1
00:59:04.816 --> 00:59:08.381
like a flute, and the kid
playing like a banjo and the cat

23a6610c-6445-40c6-8c5a-167190988e95-2
00:59:08.381 --> 00:59:09.590
sitting next to him.

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-0
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.082
And then you see the guy in the
suit folding up some paper,

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-1
00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:15.924
looks like he made another
little creature, it looks like a

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-2
00:59:15.924 --> 00:59:19.050
little cat. And he held hands to
the kid. And and then the guy in

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-3
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:21.750
the white jacket white shirt is
putting something into a

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-4
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.734
cupboard or pulling something
out of the cupboard. And there's

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-5
00:59:24.734 --> 00:59:27.718
a picture of him in in the woman
holding it together. And then

12c6d492-c627-4a8a-bd37-91dd95fe0afc-6
00:59:27.718 --> 00:59:30.040
you see it up close of just a
little pot itself.

b9f50dfc-6257-44bd-add8-e1675b52c019-0
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.400
So then you see it up close to
the pot, and then it looks like

b9f50dfc-6257-44bd-add8-e1675b52c019-1
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.238
it's on a counter, and then it
looks like it's on a counter

b9f50dfc-6257-44bd-add8-e1675b52c019-2
00:59:38.238 --> 00:59:40.840
through a window or through a
frame, and then you see.

4f21e4c5-dac5-4d23-9051-26ddde5e2ba4-0
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.817
I can't tell if that's a kid or
which guy that is, but I think

4f21e4c5-dac5-4d23-9051-26ddde5e2ba4-1
00:59:45.817 --> 00:59:46.220
it's the.

ecf052bb-04a2-456c-b2af-9efeab4090ba-0
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.253
The guy in the suit, he's waking
up, rubbing his eyes, he's

ecf052bb-04a2-456c-b2af-9efeab4090ba-1
00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:53.060
getting out of bed. There's
quite fishy things with him.

25bcebb3-37aa-4fb1-95e7-beaaf73109ef-0
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.377
And then you see him getting
dressed, buttoning his shirt,

25bcebb3-37aa-4fb1-95e7-beaaf73109ef-1
00:59:56.377 --> 00:59:59.284
cutting one of these little food
things, weird shaped food things

25bcebb3-37aa-4fb1-95e7-beaaf73109ef-2
00:59:59.284 --> 01:00:02.146
up, and then he hands a piece of
that to the white fish thing on

25bcebb3-37aa-4fb1-95e7-beaaf73109ef-3
01:00:02.146 --> 01:00:04.568
the floor, and you see him
putting on his vest and his

25bcebb3-37aa-4fb1-95e7-beaaf73109ef-4
01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:07.033
jacket. And then a little
whitefish thing, hands on his

25bcebb3-37aa-4fb1-95e7-beaaf73109ef-5
01:00:07.033 --> 01:00:07.209
hat.

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-0
01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:14.135
And so the top left, you see the
back at the backs of a bunch of

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-1
01:00:14.135 --> 01:00:17.979
people as they're walking, looks
like their little hats and suits

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-2
01:00:17.979 --> 01:00:21.357
on or good clothes on. They're
wearing bags and they have

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-3
01:00:21.357 --> 01:00:25.143
little creatures at their feet.
And then there's some clothes or

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-4
01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:28.754
something hanging on strings.
And the the up in the air above

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-5
01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:32.482
them. And then you'll see some
some guys on the looks like they

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-6
01:00:32.482 --> 01:00:35.860
have some kind of sticks or
something and they're working

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-7
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:39.587
and then it shows somebody else
who's has a basket of something

3ffa542f-6f32-44d6-a699-2a8d52d530c0-8
01:00:39.587 --> 01:00:40.170
that he's.

1e783b91-329e-4e33-a02a-04e4f802fce4-0
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.350
Giving to these little white
creatures on the ground.

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-0
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.602
And then there's a woman, a man,
and another woman looks like

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-1
01:00:46.602 --> 01:00:49.924
they're exchanging something
over a counter. And then you see

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-2
01:00:49.924 --> 01:00:53.460
a guy with a wheel on a bunch of
different shapes on it. And then

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-3
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.514
you see a guy looks like he's
painting on a ladder, he's

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-4
01:00:56.514 --> 01:00:59.836
painting something on a wall.
And then you see a woman with a

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-5
01:00:59.836 --> 01:01:03.212
cart, like she might have some
kind of a hammer or tool in her

5c799197-f434-4ff0-9d2d-53caf2ee9b75-6
01:01:03.212 --> 01:01:03.479
hand.

866b87eb-5e8d-4004-bceb-0636f36c4b49-0
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:08.264
And then on the top right, you
see the guy in the suit has the

866b87eb-5e8d-4004-bceb-0636f36c4b49-1
01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:11.553
little white fishy thing at his
feet and he's talking to

866b87eb-5e8d-4004-bceb-0636f36c4b49-2
01:01:11.553 --> 01:01:15.072
somebody in a doorway. That guy
in the doorway has a hat, an

866b87eb-5e8d-4004-bceb-0636f36c4b49-3
01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:18.130
apron and white apron on and has
a bowl in his hand.

a2ff9c62-6949-4b5c-a99b-7e966faf3d69-0
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.689
And then you see the guy in the
suit talking to somebody else

a2ff9c62-6949-4b5c-a99b-7e966faf3d69-1
01:01:22.689 --> 01:01:25.790
who looks like he's at some kind
of an industrial.

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-0
01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:29.832
Thing, because he has this big
old metal device behind him with

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-1
01:01:29.832 --> 01:01:33.147
all these valves, and that guy
has glasses, a hat, and he has

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-2
01:01:33.147 --> 01:01:36.409
this little creature sitting
next to him holding a wrench in

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-3
01:01:36.409 --> 01:01:39.884
his mouth. And then you see the
guy in the suit has his hat off.

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-4
01:01:39.884 --> 01:01:43.413
Now he's inside and he's talking
to a woman at a counter. She has

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-5
01:01:43.413 --> 01:01:46.889
a bunch of containers behind her
behind the counter, and she has

3145561b-8ccf-4e82-beaa-77f626939563-6
01:01:46.889 --> 01:01:48.440
her hands up as if she can't.

aa06c594-34f8-48bf-9f41-289af3a2fc6f-0
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:52.626
Give him whatever
he wants or she says if she's

aa06c594-34f8-48bf-9f41-289af3a2fc6f-1
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.911
saying no. And then to the right
of that is the last picture is a

aa06c594-34f8-48bf-9f41-289af3a2fc6f-2
01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:58.699
bunch of people looks like
they're guys, they're all in

aa06c594-34f8-48bf-9f41-289af3a2fc6f-3
01:01:58.699 --> 01:02:01.785
their suits and hat and they
have all creatures at their feet

aa06c594-34f8-48bf-9f41-289af3a2fc6f-4
01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:04.772
and they're underneath one of
those flying boat things with

aa06c594-34f8-48bf-9f41-289af3a2fc6f-5
01:02:04.772 --> 01:02:05.270
the power. #END_arrival_5

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:10.110
OK, so we're good with this
part of the story.

80d0d4d5-5e70-4942-aae0-99fe29fd5dc9-0
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:14.620

minutes.

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.410
So here is a complex seed.

275ab6b1-2c67-424d-8703-7966b95c577e-0
01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:40.693
FBN so fun games in ancient
Rome, so it looks like they're

275ab6b1-2c67-424d-8703-7966b95c577e-1
01:02:40.693 --> 01:02:44.725
in a big arena eventually, let's
say Coliseum. And then there's a

275ab6b1-2c67-424d-8703-7966b95c577e-2
01:02:44.725 --> 01:02:48.207
bunch of people in the middle,
and then around the edges

275ab6b1-2c67-424d-8703-7966b95c577e-3
01:02:48.207 --> 01:02:52.238
there's people in the stands. So
at the top of the screen there's

275ab6b1-2c67-424d-8703-7966b95c577e-4
01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:56.026
a pyramid of liones and some of
the lines are getting up into

275ab6b1-2c67-424d-8703-7966b95c577e-5
01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:59.629
the stands. So this people are
clearing out of the stands.

2c1e7209-a62e-458c-b328-7580ba9ddf32-0
01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:04.017
There's also looks like some
people who had a rope, whether

2c1e7209-a62e-458c-b328-7580ba9ddf32-1
01:03:04.017 --> 01:03:06.895
they're trying to get down to
the ring or back out because

2c1e7209-a62e-458c-b328-7580ba9ddf32-2
01:03:06.895 --> 01:03:10.067
there's a lion at the bottom so
that by trying to get out of the

2c1e7209-a62e-458c-b328-7580ba9ddf32-3
01:03:10.067 --> 01:03:10.359
arena.

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-0
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:16.412
And then the you'll see there's
a door towards the right of them

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-1
01:03:16.412 --> 01:03:20.097
where there's lions coming out
of the door. So in the arena

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-2
01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:23.906
there is a lion underneath that
towards the center right, who

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-3
01:03:23.906 --> 01:03:27.652

bib on knife and a fork. And

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-4

And then underneath that you'll
see there's a couple of Chariots

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-6
01:03:35.453 --> 01:03:39.323
with horses. There's one that
has four horses, 2 brown, like a

3efbfa99-4c6a-4858-add0-b4c68728cae1-7
01:03:39.323 --> 01:03:42.640

Umm, there's a couple of those
situations. There's somebody

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.991
also looks like on the far right
of that, that the chariot itself

6d564158-f9e0-461e-9a5d-7113264ead13-2
01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:53.750

Umm.

And underneath that, there's a
couple lines that are actually

on top of a person in the arena.
And there's a couple people who

01:04:07.507 --> 01:04:10.980
are looks like they're fighting
a guy who has a shield.

230fce8f-782a-4df2-a252-5d38b4eb26de-0
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.822

looks like one of the shields

230fce8f-782a-4df2-a252-5d38b4eb26de-2
01:04:18.742 --> 01:04:21.814
they're being ripped in half.
And then there's a horse who's

230fce8f-782a-4df2-a252-5d38b4eb26de-3

He actually looks like he has it
together. He's not being

051f6442-e14d-480a-b4ee-a76e996f4a41-2
01:04:33.768 --> 01:04:37.084

01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:43.353
chariot and they're trying to
run away from those. Looks like

051f6442-e14d-480a-b4ee-a76e996f4a41-5
01:04:43.353 --> 01:04:46.409

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-0
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:20.086
Says for my parents, I'm just on
the side, but it looks like

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-1
01:06:20.086 --> 01:06:23.760
there's a picture on the left of
like a street corner. So you see

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-2
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.878
like a red stoplight on the
sign. There's a corner of a

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-3
01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:30.275
building. There's like a little
tree that's you know has the

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-4
01:06:30.275 --> 01:06:33.949
little sticks tied to it to keep
it straight up on the one corner

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-5
01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:37.345
of the sidewalk. And then you
see and then it takes a couple

500915ca-e789-4b38-9f4e-496e45188022-6
01:06:37.345 --> 01:06:39.739
steps in and then you see almost

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:44.014
I thought that the house was
cut. The side of the house was

1e69b7e1-a114-4e19-803b-6b50877fbcb5-1
01:06:44.014 --> 01:06:47.739
cut so you could see the inside
of it and you can see there's

1e69b7e1-a114-4e19-803b-6b50877fbcb5-2
01:06:47.739 --> 01:06:51.584
six rooms and then a basement.
And so that you first walk into,

1e69b7e1-a114-4e19-803b-6b50877fbcb5-3
01:06:51.584 --> 01:06:55.069
you would first walk into a
room. It's like the entryway.

1e69b7e1-a114-4e19-803b-6b50877fbcb5-4
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:58.553
You see stairs or sitting
dresser with the lamp vase with

1e69b7e1-a114-4e19-803b-6b50877fbcb5-5
01:06:58.553 --> 01:07:02.098
a plant and some pictures on the
wall. And then above that

1e69b7e1-a114-4e19-803b-6b50877fbcb5-6
01:07:02.098 --> 01:07:03.360

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.757
And he has a light above him
while he's working on. And then

7f7ea13c-f17c-4b55-976f-1bf63fae11b8-1
01:07:13.757 --> 01:07:17.434
there's a window in front of him
and there's pictures in the

7f7ea13c-f17c-4b55-976f-1bf63fae11b8-2
01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:20.870
background beside him. And
there's some books on shelves

7f7ea13c-f17c-4b55-976f-1bf63fae11b8-3
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.668
coming through the door of his
room as a red kite. You see the

7f7ea13c-f17c-4b55-976f-1bf63fae11b8-4
01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:28.526

01:07:28.526 --> 01:07:32.203
It goes to the next room on the
2nd floor, where you see the

7f7ea13c-f17c-4b55-976f-1bf63fae11b8-6
01:07:32.203 --> 01:07:36.182
staircase and looks like there's
like a TV on a table and a couch

7f7ea13c-f17c-4b55-976f-1bf63fae11b8-7
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:39.979
and a chair. Nobody's in that
room. So you see the red string.

484653b1-7a8e-4de8-8023-be415a7e5945-0
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.590
Go down the staircase that would
take you to the first floor.

eded7ae6-510a-4dbc-9d1e-4f1f87a22cc6-0
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:48.212
1st floor looks like that's the
kitchen staircase goes towards

eded7ae6-510a-4dbc-9d1e-4f1f87a22cc6-1
01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:50.840
the kitchen. There's cabinets,

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.860
And there's nobody in the
kitchen. Then you go to the

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-1
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.100
right of that, through a
doorway, into a looks like a

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-2
01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.000
bedroom. In the bedroom there's
a bed with some purple things on

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-3
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.660
it. And then you see there's a
boy, one of the boys from the

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-4
01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:09.080
four he has a crown on. He has
some red string that he's

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-5
01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.740
drawing archway on his one wall
and has something red in his

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-6
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.640
left hand. And he's drawing with
his right hand he has a dresser

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-7
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.480
a lamp and a window next to it.
And then on the ceiling you see

58fcae47-e472-438c-9031-83ba6277ea67-8
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.440
it looks like a.

fd6cb43d-f4e5-459f-9f49-9b5fc1d281f3-0
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:25.616
Purple dragonfly and like a red
hot air balloon hanging from the

fd6cb43d-f4e5-459f-9f49-9b5fc1d281f3-1
01:08:25.616 --> 01:08:26.120
ceiling.

584be1bb-f4b1-4c2d-ba31-3fbc813ba050-0
01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:30.946
And then in the room above him,
there's nobody in it, but it

584be1bb-f4b1-4c2d-ba31-3fbc813ba050-1
01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:35.328
looks like there is a bathroom
or at least a sink. And and then

584be1bb-f4b1-4c2d-ba31-3fbc813ba050-2
01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:39.709
through the door there is a bed
with or piece of furniture with

584be1bb-f4b1-4c2d-ba31-3fbc813ba050-3
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:40.600
like a black.

a8398e4f-fafb-4e9f-a070-2ec36757d297-0
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.090
Creature on it.

98a73396-c774-4afc-b7ff-c898fa23d0f8-0
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.578
So then on the left there's a
three-part picture on the top

98a73396-c774-4afc-b7ff-c898fa23d0f8-1
01:08:48.578 --> 01:08:48.860
left.

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-0
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:53.369
Is, uh, the man who's working on
that on the desk on the easel

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-1
01:08:53.369 --> 01:08:56.553
looks like he's drawing. He
looks back behind him and he

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-2
01:08:56.553 --> 01:09:00.128
sees the red flag, a red kite on
the floor, and the second part

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-3
01:09:00.128 --> 01:09:03.647
of the picture, he gets up off
his chair and he goes and picks

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-4
01:09:03.647 --> 01:09:06.831
up the kite. On the third
picture, you see the desk, the

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-5
01:09:06.831 --> 01:09:10.295
chair, and the kite, but the
guy's not there anymore. So then

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-6
01:09:10.295 --> 01:09:13.758
on the next picture you see the
room where the little boy was

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-7
01:09:13.758 --> 01:09:17.110
before, the far right bottom
room floor, and the doors open

9c83b92d-b280-4662-863b-b2d7732ca3d3-8
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:20.350
into his room, and you can still
see the hot air balloon.

83861b4d-e0b8-44a4-90b4-e6b795a32e37-0
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:24.005
Dragonfly thing from the ceiling
and the purple creature on the

83861b4d-e0b8-44a4-90b4-e6b795a32e37-1
01:09:24.005 --> 01:09:27.302
bed, and then where the boy had
drawn the red archway. Now

83861b4d-e0b8-44a4-90b4-e6b795a32e37-2
01:09:27.302 --> 01:09:30.598
there's a little red door, and
you see the man in the blue

83861b4d-e0b8-44a4-90b4-e6b795a32e37-3
01:09:30.598 --> 01:09:33.560
shirt and shorts peeking his
head through that door.

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-0
01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.147
So the man goes through that
door, and on the other side of

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-1
01:09:40.147 --> 01:09:43.745
the door, that door is actually
at the base of one of a really

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-2
01:09:43.745 --> 01:09:47.344
tall tree. So now he's in like
this forest where there's these

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-3
01:09:47.344 --> 01:09:50.714
really tall trees. There's
hanging lanterns with like warm

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-4
01:09:50.714 --> 01:09:54.141
orangish yellowish light. And
there's some other strings of

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-5
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.740
lights also hanging between the
trees. There is some yellowish

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-6
01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:01.167
green. There's just a couple
yellowish green lights hanging

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-7
01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:04.766
in the trees as well. There's a
Little River, a little just so

04e3da09-8364-419e-815b-a7525b213f85-8
01:10:04.766 --> 01:10:06.080
low river next to them.

8ba99101-f6b7-4a5a-b3ba-2b548ed0a5c5-0
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:08.967
the Creek. And then you see
there's a little wooden dock

8ba99101-f6b7-4a5a-b3ba-2b548ed0a5c5-1
01:10:08.967 --> 01:10:11.982
with a red ball at the edge of
the dock on the other side of

8ba99101-f6b7-4a5a-b3ba-2b548ed0a5c5-2
01:10:11.982 --> 01:10:13.909
the Little River that he's
looking at.

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-0
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:20.419
So then you see the guy who's
now at the end of that dock

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-1
01:10:20.419 --> 01:10:23.481
holding the red ball. You see
still the lights in the

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-2
01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:27.054
lanterns, and then the water.
Now it's glistening a little bit

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-3
01:10:27.054 --> 01:10:30.513
with reflection of the lights.
And you see there's like this

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-4
01:10:30.513 --> 01:10:34.029
dragon shaped yellowish boat
that's now coming down the river

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-5
01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:37.432
with nobody on it. And then on
the right side of the screen

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-6
01:10:37.432 --> 01:10:40.721
there's a three-part picture.
The top part has the demand

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-7
01:10:40.721 --> 01:10:44.294
still standing on the dock with
the red ball. And there's that

cd7c5d01-9420-4ef9-ac66-11a8e6174241-8
01:10:44.294 --> 01:10:47.130
dragon type colored boat which
has a wheel on it.

268e1232-bea9-4335-81bc-3d6f594e6210-0
01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.204
And then you second part of the
picture, you see him, the boats

268e1232-bea9-4335-81bc-3d6f594e6210-1
01:10:51.204 --> 01:10:54.529
kind of moving in front of him
now and he's looking at it as if

268e1232-bea9-4335-81bc-3d6f594e6210-2
01:10:54.529 --> 01:10:57.854
he's going to get on it. And the
third part of the picture, the

268e1232-bea9-4335-81bc-3d6f594e6210-3
01:10:57.854 --> 01:11:00.919
the boat is now past the dock
and the guys now on the boat

268e1232-bea9-4335-81bc-3d6f594e6210-4
01:11:00.919 --> 01:11:02.010
holding the red ball.

ddc005bd-9fbe-41cb-ad51-274947b8f4b2-0
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:08.280
So then you see the guy um still
on the boat with the red ball

ddc005bd-9fbe-41cb-ad51-274947b8f4b2-1
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.848
and the boats now approaching
these open doorways that are

ddc005bd-9fbe-41cb-ad51-274947b8f4b2-2
01:11:11.848 --> 01:11:13.360
going towards the castle.

859c2b6d-4c10-4714-baaa-c43f866e6c12-0
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:17.375
And the castle, it's like this
big stone castle. Bunch of

859c2b6d-4c10-4714-baaa-c43f866e6c12-1
01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:20.878
turrets and different shapes and
arches and stone bluish roof.

859c2b6d-4c10-4714-baaa-c43f866e6c12-2
01:11:20.878 --> 01:11:24.381
And there's some flags hanging
from the different peaks of the

859c2b6d-4c10-4714-baaa-c43f866e6c12-3
01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:24.659
roof.

e347165a-b3df-456f-9b5c-438bb2d4837e-0
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:29.274
And towards the right you see
there's a large archway, and on

e347165a-b3df-456f-9b5c-438bb2d4837e-1
01:11:29.274 --> 01:11:31.850
top of the archway there's a
little red.

4fc574bf-1a3a-489c-b199-1f7c96b95fee-0
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.501
A boat or something or car that
you see the little boy sitting

4fc574bf-1a3a-489c-b199-1f7c96b95fee-1
01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:40.203
in, and then there's some other
buildings on the right and the

4fc574bf-1a3a-489c-b199-1f7c96b95fee-2
01:11:40.203 --> 01:11:41.320
one has some light.

dc42ff4c-c8c5-4e1d-8875-79f3cbd92aff-0
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.100
Under the structure and there's
a million factors.

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-0
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:49.868
And then you see the boy
presumably have followed that

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-1
01:11:49.868 --> 01:11:52.676
and the man who followed the
boys. And then you see the

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-2
01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:55.685
Dragon boat now docked, where
the little boy's red boat is.

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-3
01:11:55.685 --> 01:11:58.795
There's people around, there's
some musicians who are holding

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-4
01:11:58.795 --> 01:12:02.004
trumpets, and then a little boys
kind of dashing up the stairs.

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-5
01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:05.164
He has a crown on and he has the
red marker. And at the top of

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-6
01:12:05.164 --> 01:12:08.223
the stairs it's the other boy
with the purple marker and the

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-7
01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:11.132
crown on, the little purple
creatures hanging above them.

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-8
01:12:11.132 --> 01:12:13.840
And then the king from
previously he sent sending out

9e86162c-858e-4c0c-af4e-81b26ea2ef29-9
01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.899
the top was there as well with
the board, the purple crayon.

e9063740-269b-4622-a427-6c4fcd0d27ff-0
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.000
And there's some lights behind
them under the building that

e9063740-269b-4622-a427-6c4fcd0d27ff-1
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:20.470
they're at.

861546a8-47df-47a7-8a6c-5a2096cfa033-0
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:26.285
On the right side of the picture
it's shows the man approaching

861546a8-47df-47a7-8a6c-5a2096cfa033-1
01:12:26.285 --> 01:12:30.369
the king and the boy with the
purple crayon, and then the boy

861546a8-47df-47a7-8a6c-5a2096cfa033-2
01:12:30.369 --> 01:12:34.255
with the red crayon far away
from him next to like a royal

861546a8-47df-47a7-8a6c-5a2096cfa033-3

chair or like a kings chair.

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-0
01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.159
So then you see the back angle
of that's if you're standing

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-1
01:12:42.159 --> 01:12:45.679

and the the man, the blue shirt,

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-2
01:12:45.679 --> 01:12:48.878
they're all standing together
now, and the purple creatures

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-3
01:12:48.878 --> 01:12:51.971
being on top of them hanging in
the air. And then they're

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-4
01:12:51.971 --> 01:12:55.011
looking down at that dragon
boat, and at the Dragon boat

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-5
01:12:55.011 --> 01:12:58.317
that brought the guy at the blue
shirt. There's now like some

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-6
01:12:58.317 --> 01:13:01.250
kind of an armed guard looks

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-7
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:04.610
approaching them. And they all
seem to be a little startled by

b01192c2-4f50-4d3c-9fe5-859f41bb35a8-8
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.770
it.

d4118372-12e6-488c-bbbd-5904a6fd4e77-0
01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.694
And then on the next side of the
picture you see a bunch of

d4118372-12e6-488c-bbbd-5904a6fd4e77-1
01:13:08.694 --> 01:13:11.808
guards coming up the stairs off
of that boat. Looks like they

d4118372-12e6-488c-bbbd-5904a6fd4e77-2
01:13:11.808 --> 01:13:12.060
came.

ed41b3b1-2c68-49f0-87c5-f02ea4b9033e-0
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.870
Out of the.

51777c7c-9434-4f14-8a48-9e05f5b10840-0
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.168
Part of the boat, not where the
guy was standing on, but like

51777c7c-9434-4f14-8a48-9e05f5b10840-1
01:13:17.168 --> 01:13:18.620
the front part of the boat, like
a.

0e04c663-d54d-446c-ae6b-08db2bca05a9-0
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.971
And then they're coming up the
stairs and the king is first,

0e04c663-d54d-446c-ae6b-08db2bca05a9-1
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:27.557
and then the two boys and the
guy in the blue shirt are behind

0e04c663-d54d-446c-ae6b-08db2bca05a9-2
01:13:27.557 --> 01:13:28.070
the king.

c09d27b3-77ed-44d1-af80-642da279fb2b-0
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.870
And the king has his hand up his
pistol.

961dbb25-5bd7-4c0e-94f0-4d53864ee141-0
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:39.762
And so it looks like the king is
drawing something with gold. He

961dbb25-5bd7-4c0e-94f0-4d53864ee141-1
01:13:39.762 --> 01:13:43.666
has gold stick he has in his
hand, and the one guard has this

961dbb25-5bd7-4c0e-94f0-4d53864ee141-2
01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:47.570
weird contraption with like a
crank handle, like a box with a

961dbb25-5bd7-4c0e-94f0-4d53864ee141-3
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:51.410
crank handle on his left hand.
And then the boys and the man

961dbb25-5bd7-4c0e-94f0-4d53864ee141-4
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:52.670
are behind the king.

45d6fcab-ecd2-429a-a4f2-c0566fd4ffc6-0
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:56.810
Um, so then on the right side
there's a three-part picture.

45d6fcab-ecd2-429a-a4f2-c0566fd4ffc6-1
01:13:56.810 --> 01:14:00.537
You see the king with the yellow
looks like he drew a sword, and

45d6fcab-ecd2-429a-a4f2-c0566fd4ffc6-2
01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:03.805
he's pointing a sword towards
the one guy, the one guard

45d6fcab-ecd2-429a-a4f2-c0566fd4ffc6-3
01:14:03.805 --> 01:14:06.500
where, whoever that is, who has
that crank box

264f64d0-d2eb-4669-b472-c0bc75819ca2-0
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.090
And then the second part of the
picture.

8467a610-531f-41e0-a86d-e2c5c7e19996-0
01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.330
Looks like.

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-0
01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.314
The King is losing the sword and
the different color things he

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-1
01:14:15.314 --> 01:14:18.556
has with them. They're coming
off of that belt. He has across

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-2
01:14:18.556 --> 01:14:21.851
them. So the guy with the crank
box looks like it's sucking in

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-3
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:25.093
all those things into his box.
And then the third part of the

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-4
01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:28.336
picture, you see the King now
being detained by the two armed

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-5
01:14:28.336 --> 01:14:31.735
guards towards the bottom of the
stairs and the guy with a crank

d67af01f-70ca-4c42-98d4-aab126ff2923-6
01:14:31.735 --> 01:14:35.029
box running up past the king and
there's no more colors in it.

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-0
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:39.851
And then on this side you see
the guy with a crank box

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-1
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:43.446
approaching the boys, and the
guy in the blue shirt. The boy

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-2
01:14:43.446 --> 01:14:47.041
still has with the Red Crayon,
still has the purple creature

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-3
01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:50.400
with him. And the boy with the
blue purple Crayon is now

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-4
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.054
towards the far right of the
page, and he's drawing something

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-5
01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:57.708
in the air. It looks like some
kind of wings. And then on the

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-6
01:14:57.708 --> 01:15:01.244
right side you see where they
were was the top of a pyramid

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-7
01:15:01.244 --> 01:15:04.721
next to some water, and you see
the guy with the crank box

eea4d12d-b27d-4af6-8ee5-01ca3e65143f-8
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:06.490
reaching for them at the edge.

092a9283-1278-4dd4-8cb1-ea50475fbbe3-0
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:10.766
That that building or the edge
of that patio and in the air you

092a9283-1278-4dd4-8cb1-ea50475fbbe3-1
01:15:10.766 --> 01:15:14.897
see this big purple lion type
creature with the tail and wings

092a9283-1278-4dd4-8cb1-ea50475fbbe3-2
01:15:14.897 --> 01:15:19.160
and it has the two boys and the
guy in the blue shirt riding it.

727d9f7b-7309-43ae-9d75-7a4edee4e23f-0
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:20.940
And they're getting away.

7ce1dcf9-6082-463c-8d58-d090756132bb-0
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.619
Um, so there's a two page spread
where you see the same picture

7ce1dcf9-6082-463c-8d58-d090756132bb-1
01:15:27.619 --> 01:15:28.620
of the guys who are

bd238c46-a6b3-426f-8e69-55c76cdd3c3c-0
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.302
And the two boys and the guy who
were on that lion, the one

bd238c46-a6b3-426f-8e69-55c76cdd3c3c-1
01:15:33.302 --> 01:15:36.234
towards the front has the red
stick and the purple, small

bd238c46-a6b3-426f-8e69-55c76cdd3c3c-2
01:15:36.234 --> 01:15:39.367
purple creature with them and
the guy towards the kid towards

bd238c46-a6b3-426f-8e69-55c76cdd3c3c-3
01:15:39.367 --> 01:15:42.552
the back, looks like he's losing
his purple crayon in the air.

bd238c46-a6b3-426f-8e69-55c76cdd3c3c-4
01:15:42.552 --> 01:15:45.786
And then because it looks like
further back on the left you see

bd238c46-a6b3-426f-8e69-55c76cdd3c3c-5
01:15:45.786 --> 01:15:48.870
the guy, that crank box kind of
like sucking the the purple.

3d5810bb-1cf0-40de-8896-51606e041a3e-0
01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.840
Creature or whatever the magical
creature is into his crank box

3d5810bb-1cf0-40de-8896-51606e041a3e-1
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.540
as well. It's by where the kids
perfect plans going.

1d19cee9-c423-4d97-bc69-79cc13639c8d-0
01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.160
So then it looks like.

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-0
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:06.074
That guard must have sucked that
creature up. And then you see

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-1
01:16:06.074 --> 01:16:09.819
the people are now in the air.
So the guy in the blue shirt or

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-2
01:16:09.819 --> 01:16:13.563
in the air just floating in the
air or falling. And the kid on

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-3
01:16:13.563 --> 01:16:17.248
the far left is being the one
who had the purple crowns being

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-4
01:16:17.248 --> 01:16:21.112
grabbed by the king who's on now
boat in the air. And the guy in

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-5
01:16:21.112 --> 01:16:24.857
the blue shirt grabbing on to
the other little boy who has the

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-6
01:16:24.857 --> 01:16:28.304
red crayon on the purple
creature, and they're hanging in

1065efee-640c-4408-963e-036006039709-7
01:16:28.304 --> 01:16:28.779
the air.

40497768-164a-4a71-af1c-a8b5edba4209-0
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.214
And then you see those two, the
the guy with the blue shirt and

40497768-164a-4a71-af1c-a8b5edba4209-1
01:16:35.214 --> 01:16:38.344
the other kid with the I think
that's the red Crayon kid and

40497768-164a-4a71-af1c-a8b5edba4209-2
01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:41.577
the purple creature now falling
into the water. And underneath

40497768-164a-4a71-af1c-a8b5edba4209-3
01:16:41.577 --> 01:16:44.400
the water there's some goldfish
and there's different.

0dd43382-9024-4630-a79f-84fe83870cd5-0
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.934
Like pieces of land sticking up
out of the and into the water,

0dd43382-9024-4630-a79f-84fe83870cd5-1
01:16:48.934 --> 01:16:52.422
but they're still in the water.
And then you see the little boy

0dd43382-9024-4630-a79f-84fe83870cd5-2
01:16:52.422 --> 01:16:55.857
drawing something with his red
marker and looks like he's draw

0dd43382-9024-4630-a79f-84fe83870cd5-3
01:16:55.857 --> 01:16:57.220
like a boat or something.

1e9b05ba-452e-4b70-b350-aaf0a34b84e2-0
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.216
And so then you see looks like
what you Drew was a submarine

1e9b05ba-452e-4b70-b350-aaf0a34b84e2-1
01:17:03.216 --> 01:17:06.423
and so he is towards the top of
the submarine control like a

1e9b05ba-452e-4b70-b350-aaf0a34b84e2-2
01:17:06.423 --> 01:17:09.525
Periscope, and then the guy in
the blue shirts towards the

1e9b05ba-452e-4b70-b350-aaf0a34b84e2-3
01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:12.731
bottom submarine and they're
going under the water, which is

1e9b05ba-452e-4b70-b350-aaf0a34b84e2-4
01:17:12.731 --> 01:17:15.149
the Periscope sticking out, out
of the water.

5e663cfd-41e0-4223-8a16-d0df1da6a4e2-0
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:21.229
And now it looks like the
submarine has surfaced up onto

5e663cfd-41e0-4223-8a16-d0df1da6a4e2-1
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:24.529
the water and they're standing
on top of the submarine. They're

5e663cfd-41e0-4223-8a16-d0df1da6a4e2-2
01:17:24.529 --> 01:17:27.675
like under a cave or in a cave
area. There's drawings on the

5e663cfd-41e0-4223-8a16-d0df1da6a4e2-3
01:17:27.675 --> 01:17:31.027
wall. And so the guy in the blue
shirt, blue shirt, the kid with

5e663cfd-41e0-4223-8a16-d0df1da6a4e2-4
01:17:31.027 --> 01:17:34.018
a red crayon on, the little
small flying purple creature,

5e663cfd-41e0-4223-8a16-d0df1da6a4e2-5
01:17:34.018 --> 01:17:34.740
all with them.

9bde8033-019f-45af-9c47-ec225f4251a6-0
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.920
And there's nobody else around.

6d412a8d-85c5-4626-a36f-ff106c4e3482-0
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:42.629
And then looks like they get off
the submarine. They're now on

6d412a8d-85c5-4626-a36f-ff106c4e3482-1
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:45.243
the ground in The Cave. And
their point, the little boy's

6d412a8d-85c5-4626-a36f-ff106c4e3482-2
01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:48.083
pointing at the wall with the
different creatures on the wall.

6d412a8d-85c5-4626-a36f-ff106c4e3482-3
01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:50.968
I mean different drawings on the
wall and there the guy in blue

6d412a8d-85c5-4626-a36f-ff106c4e3482-4
01:17:50.968 --> 01:17:52.139
shirts looking up at that.

c3769ab3-3bfd-497f-bdd3-c6fe5831073e-0
01:17:56.110 --> 01:18:00.864
So it looks like they're looking
up at that and then now they see

c3769ab3-3bfd-497f-bdd3-c6fe5831073e-1
01:18:00.864 --> 01:18:03.890
that the guy with the crank box
and that.

a5deb598-9962-41f1-8e09-acfa95bd90e0-0
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.940
Dragon type boat with the king
and the armed guards are now

a5deb598-9962-41f1-8e09-acfa95bd90e0-1
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.778
approaching the beginning of The
Cave, so they're trying to hide

a5deb598-9962-41f1-8e09-acfa95bd90e0-2
01:18:10.778 --> 01:18:11.390
behind a rock.

0d942565-5c28-490a-8d87-c38f760cf2c0-0
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.190
And then on the right side of
the picture.

a9ecd7fc-0057-40df-8cce-e194eede6246-0
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:17.590
Umm, you see

b669696a-d2a1-4517-b6ca-42bee9abd135-0
01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.322
So also I was just saying the
top left, the drawings in The

b669696a-d2a1-4517-b6ca-42bee9abd135-1
01:18:23.322 --> 01:18:25.741
Cave looks kind of like similar
to what's happening in the sense

b669696a-d2a1-4517-b6ca-42bee9abd135-2
01:18:25.741 --> 01:18:28.160
that there's somebody with a box
and there's stuff coming out of

b669696a-d2a1-4517-b6ca-42bee9abd135-3
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.170
it and then there's somebody
reaching for things, so.

f9ac8510-53d7-42fa-9ecd-a1705030bb2c-0
01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:34.994
But then, so on the right side
of the picture, there's three

f9ac8510-53d7-42fa-9ecd-a1705030bb2c-1
01:18:34.994 --> 01:18:38.219
parts of that picture. The top
left is the guy in the blue

f9ac8510-53d7-42fa-9ecd-a1705030bb2c-2
01:18:38.219 --> 01:18:41.171
shirt and the kid, and the
purple creature looks like

f9ac8510-53d7-42fa-9ecd-a1705030bb2c-3
01:18:41.171 --> 01:18:44.614
they're coming up with a plan.
And then the second part is the

f9ac8510-53d7-42fa-9ecd-a1705030bb2c-4
01:18:44.614 --> 01:18:46.200
guy starts to Draw Something.

f3a39427-b793-4b92-bcc4-d7fc043584ca-0
01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.870
And then it looks like.

061a1f7b-5379-4dfd-895b-582dfd869f66-0
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:51.590
He finishes in the.

5e3de4f5-aabd-4689-aa16-c0731379734b-0
01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.943
Purple small purple creature is
like in like a bird cage what

5e3de4f5-aabd-4689-aa16-c0731379734b-1
01:18:55.943 --> 01:18:56.590
the guy drew.

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-0
01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:06.219
So the guy and the boy are still
hiding behind a rock and now

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-1
01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:10.378
they have that purple creature
just on a bird cage in this bird

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-2
01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:14.472
cage type structure that they
grew that's sitting next to them

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-3
01:19:14.472 --> 01:19:18.567
in The Cave. So the guy with the
crank box goes over trying to

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-4
01:19:18.567 --> 01:19:22.531
suck that up and then ended up
being a trap. So then he gets

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-5
01:19:22.531 --> 01:19:26.625
towards the middle of the that
bird cage and then the walls of

3fb1077b-8c26-424b-860c-d60917fd4793-6
01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:30.199
it start to go up and he loses
the crank box and then.

a59c2266-c123-4629-a869-e05eba03ed71-0
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:34.106
It's the walls go up. So now
he's stuck in the cage and the

a59c2266-c123-4629-a869-e05eba03ed71-1
01:19:34.106 --> 01:19:37.376
guy with the blue shirt and the
kid with a white and the kid

a59c2266-c123-4629-a869-e05eba03ed71-2
01:19:37.376 --> 01:19:40.861
little kid has the little crank
box and looks like the guys that

a59c2266-c123-4629-a869-e05eba03ed71-3
01:19:40.861 --> 01:19:44.239
has it over his shoulders like
it's about to throw it or smash

a59c2266-c123-4629-a869-e05eba03ed71-4
01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:44.400
it.

76aa8a5a-9327-41a4-8e8c-d15871d086c2-0
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:49.845
So it looks like he does smash
it, and when he smashes it, all

76aa8a5a-9327-41a4-8e8c-d15871d086c2-1
01:19:49.845 --> 01:19:51.990
these different colors come out
so that purple.

ec742dfa-ae66-450e-8a45-41abc8924b45-0
01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.360
Lion type wing creature that got
them off that last temple is now

ec742dfa-ae66-450e-8a45-41abc8924b45-1
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.357
up in the air. The little purple
creature that was in the bird

ec742dfa-ae66-450e-8a45-41abc8924b45-2
01:19:59.357 --> 01:20:02.402
cage trap is now out in the air.
There's swirls of blue and red

ec742dfa-ae66-450e-8a45-41abc8924b45-3
01:20:02.402 --> 01:20:05.257
and yellow and green and all
kinds of different colors, and

ec742dfa-ae66-450e-8a45-41abc8924b45-4
01:20:05.257 --> 01:20:08.350
all these little dragonflies and
creatures are coming out of it.

999bc95e-96dd-4eff-87ad-b74c461bea9a-0
01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.836
The one guy still stuck in that
little cage box, you see the

999bc95e-96dd-4eff-87ad-b74c461bea9a-1
01:20:12.836 --> 01:20:15.705
king and the other boy now
coming into The Cave. And then

999bc95e-96dd-4eff-87ad-b74c461bea9a-2
01:20:15.705 --> 01:20:18.969
there's two armed guards who are
on that dragon boat who are kind

999bc95e-96dd-4eff-87ad-b74c461bea9a-3
01:20:18.969 --> 01:20:22.035
of like their arms in front of
them, as if they're, you know,

999bc95e-96dd-4eff-87ad-b74c461bea9a-4
01:20:22.035 --> 01:20:24.953
they're surprised and like,
protecting themselves from all

999bc95e-96dd-4eff-87ad-b74c461bea9a-5
01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:26.140
those colors coming out.

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-0
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:33.112
And then you see the two boys,
the guy in the blue shirt and

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-1
01:20:33.112 --> 01:20:36.651
the king and the little small
purple creature, I'll just kind

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-2
01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:40.190
of hanging on the edge of The
Cave and they're looking out at

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-3
01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:43.844
the water and at the water. You
see the little dragon boat, the

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-4
01:20:43.844 --> 01:20:47.383
armed guards, and you see the
tentacles, the purple tentacles

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-5
01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:51.094
from previous part of the story
that are now outreached right by

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-6
01:20:51.094 --> 01:20:54.633
that dragon boat. You see all
the different colors in the air

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-7
01:20:54.633 --> 01:20:58.344
and then the purple dragon, and
I mean the purple Lion type wing

3f891432-9a2f-4e0b-a7e8-92f7d6a3bcfa-8
01:20:58.344 --> 01:20:59.999
creature is now carrying off.

45cc8646-e9f1-44ff-90da-2adb150ea633-0
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.110
That guy who's in that cage

908fa0d6-20d6-4090-9202-3826e04d2377-0
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:05.580
And then the right side.

db30ff97-b4eb-433b-a1bf-30b4a6dd2e00-0
01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.782
You see the one little boy
hugging the guy in the blue

db30ff97-b4eb-433b-a1bf-30b4a6dd2e00-1
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:13.770
shirt, and then there's the door
with the kite string close to

db30ff97-b4eb-433b-a1bf-30b4a6dd2e00-2
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:16.430
it. So looks like the door to
his bedroom

3d4c4fd6-be74-411a-9a9e-bd3807d1533a-0
01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.969
So and then you see you're back
to the regular city skyline and

3d4c4fd6-be74-411a-9a9e-bd3807d1533a-1
01:21:24.969 --> 01:21:29.386
you see the red kite in the air
with some trees and then you see

3d4c4fd6-be74-411a-9a9e-bd3807d1533a-2
01:21:29.386 --> 01:21:33.803
like that slice of the house and
there's third store, nothing in

3d4c4fd6-be74-411a-9a9e-bd3807d1533a-3
01:21:33.803 --> 01:21:38.084
there. The second story is the
guy's work room area and he has

3d4c4fd6-be74-411a-9a9e-bd3807d1533a-4
01:21:38.084 --> 01:21:41.890
a little arch like cubbyhole
door and it's very bright.

baee8c0f-d984-4674-a887-98db50be9979-0
01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.676
And underneath that
is first floor. There's nothing

baee8c0f-d984-4674-a887-98db50be9979-1
01:21:45.676 --> 01:21:47.910
in there. It's just the entry
though. #END_return alright?
