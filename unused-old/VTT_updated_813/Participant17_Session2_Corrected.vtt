00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:12.111
scene and what is happening.
#START_picture_this OK, it looks

4944fbcf-a58a-48aa-adf1-3845fbe5a207-2
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:16.485
like there are several
individual pictures within this

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.382
There are many kind of layered
on top of each other, scattered

35d1eab1-4018-4009-833c-52a2f4682748-1
00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:23.740

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.570
Disorganized.

bcda362c-ee3e-42b8-8b3c-4eafcd462472-0
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.566
There are pictures of individual
animals and creatures such as

bcda362c-ee3e-42b8-8b3c-4eafcd462472-1
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.490
like a camel face I see a
dragon.

There are human figures. A man

a2fe82b3-d27d-4c4d-8645-f8e18d03241c-1
00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:49.835
walking it looks like in scuba
deer scuba gear carrying an

a2fe82b3-d27d-4c4d-8645-f8e18d03241c-2
00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:55.164
umbrella. And a man standing
underneath a palm tree with

a2fe82b3-d27d-4c4d-8645-f8e18d03241c-3
00:00:55.164 --> 00:01:00.120
coconuts kind of falling on
another gentleman there.

62d4b2ba-e71a-4835-9676-2eb4788d9d78-0
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.980
That's in the center.

3653d8a6-94e5-4660-b30a-36e5aedac32f-0
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.470

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.634
Cactus that seems to be running
in one of the photos there's a

0f5f175d-b983-4c92-8ade-eefc56af15e6-1
00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:12.100
hippo.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.800
It looks like kind of two men
and Knights armor there's.

45ba03bf-f25f-474e-94ca-b374a8720008-0
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.730
A plane and several different.

c84f9f9b-6ae7-4744-a751-de6be4e37884-0
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.470
Figures.

256bc138-817e-4ace-ab7f-89340893e6a4-0
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.332
And most of the pictures have
one or two individuals in each

256bc138-817e-4ace-ab7f-89340893e6a4-1
00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:37.710
one.

7af9fc8c-9d96-4914-85e8-7a8eb480f8e5-0

And there are some that are
doing activities. Like in one

7af9fc8c-9d96-4914-85e8-7a8eb480f8e5-1

like it's feeding something to a

7af9fc8c-9d96-4914-85e8-7a8eb480f8e5-2

ef81f624-da35-4086-8054-abc9cdb804e6-0
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.414
A man laying down and another
stepping on him with like a pile

ef81f624-da35-4086-8054-abc9cdb804e6-1
00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:01.600
of wood maybe.

290bcb6e-1ffe-4106-af32-7db1a045f397-0
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.180

wearing multiple hats layered on

6036571a-256b-4ce3-80f5-78592132c9f6-1
00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.770
top of their head and also
holding a couple. There's a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.040
jester in one of the individual
pictures.

838ac696-a3b9-4b88-9959-2d113b9523e9-0
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.915
Bars and one of the picture kind
of looks like leaning over

838ac696-a3b9-4b88-9959-2d113b9523e9-1
00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:30.430

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.100
There's a hand in one of the
pictures.

eb432d29-ef6e-4baf-8974-f84679b6ff66-0
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.020
There are what looks like two
kind of sumo wrestlers.

bc47484c-0fab-4355-9fb5-a08cad020103-0
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.360
There are two Cavemen.

fc1631ac-ebf1-44ca-86de-f95f887952f4-0
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.512
But all of
these pictures are kind of again

fc1631ac-ebf1-44ca-86de-f95f887952f4-1
00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:57.356
disorganized, strewn about, and
kind of layered on top of each

fc1631ac-ebf1-44ca-86de-f95f887952f4-2
00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:58.760
other. No organization. #END_picture_this 

19e64aa6-c8ad-42fd-af10-bda9de96119c-0
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.960
OK, perfect. The next one is
also a complex scene.

71f0be58-675f-4491-9591-7899c5593c60-0
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.132
You know, share my screen in
one second. Just let me make

71f0be58-675f-4491-9591-7899c5593c60-1
00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:23.930
sure it's the right one.

3cbb964b-ecbe-433d-8d7f-a5cb5a70bb1c-0
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.870
Oh, there we go.

7c8de248-d0ca-4a29-a9ce-5707348ae4eb-0
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.792
OK, now I'm gonna share my
screen. OK, there we go. Do you

7c8de248-d0ca-4a29-a9ce-5707348ae4eb-1
00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:57.115
see my screen? OK, perfect. So
same thing. This is also a

7c8de248-d0ca-4a29-a9ce-5707348ae4eb-2
00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:00.916
complex scene. OK?
#START_ancient_rome this looks

7c8de248-d0ca-4a29-a9ce-5707348ae4eb-3
00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:05.612
like the old games and like the
Colosseum. So you see the back

7c8de248-d0ca-4a29-a9ce-5707348ae4eb-4
00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:10.010
wall of the Colosseum on the
upper portion of the picture.

71c67479-1f49-4a6d-936c-d14fefffabb8-0
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.181
There are what looks like
observers around, so there's

71c67479-1f49-4a6d-936c-d14fefffabb8-1
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:23.182
like the the crowd of people
watching and then in the middle

71c67479-1f49-4a6d-936c-d14fefffabb8-2
00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:29.479
in the ring, there are several
things going on. So you see kind

71c67479-1f49-4a6d-936c-d14fefffabb8-3
00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.660
of like the.

c9f7f503-93f8-4876-8481-2639ff472381-0
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.419
The trojan horses, it looks
like, are the the horses with

c9f7f503-93f8-4876-8481-2639ff472381-1
00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.260
the riding carriage on the back.

e8a23851-61b6-44ee-a5e1-668fc8df5ed4-0
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.745
The upper wall has lions going
from kind of that ring, crawling

e8a23851-61b6-44ee-a5e1-668fc8df5ed4-1
00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:54.538
into the stands with the crowds,
and also looks like there's a

e8a23851-61b6-44ee-a5e1-668fc8df5ed4-2
00:04:54.538 --> 00:05:00.147
band in the stands in the right
upper right hand side of the

e8a23851-61b6-44ee-a5e1-668fc8df5ed4-3
00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:04.010
picture. Or soldiers maybe, I
can't tell.

6fa75e0b-eaa5-4dc6-bca3-19fb1f5b36e2-0
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.400
Maybe like the Trojan sword, the
Roman soldiers.

a927b352-0509-4b4b-ace0-9931991b6d9e-0
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.168
There are several people in the
ring, lions running around and

a927b352-0509-4b4b-ace0-9931991b6d9e-1
00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:20.540
so some of the people are
holding.

63890ed4-24d8-47c6-b9b4-1ac1f66ff584-0
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.031
You know, something to fight
with. They have like the

63890ed4-24d8-47c6-b9b4-1ac1f66ff584-1
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:32.096
Shields, swords, and several,
several people are trying to run

63890ed4-24d8-47c6-b9b4-1ac1f66ff584-2
00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:36.760
out of the way of these horses
and the lions in the ring.

6ac76662-44fc-40c6-ac13-06c83fc696ee-0
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.008
I also see it looks like maybe
cheetahs that are in the ring. A

6ac76662-44fc-40c6-ac13-06c83fc696ee-1
00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:49.830
couple other large cats besides
the lions.

2d2588cd-d42b-4da3-91c4-7a63f0296300-0
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.620
Umm.

f1f93867-bb10-4e0f-8535-72049e9eecaa-0
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.138
People kind of fighting all over
and trying to get away from the

f1f93867-bb10-4e0f-8535-72049e9eecaa-1
00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:06.903
animals. In that ring. There's
even a man kind of being dragged

f1f93867-bb10-4e0f-8535-72049e9eecaa-2
00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:11.667
with his hands. You can see as
he was like being dragged by his

f1f93867-bb10-4e0f-8535-72049e9eecaa-3
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:15.389
feet and trying to grasp
something in the ground.

9133b0ed-56aa-45f2-baed-606febcbcb07-0
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.940
And.

24046553-ff1a-454f-91f8-97f01c08e02f-0
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.070
There's a lion on top of a man.

7dbcc9fa-5e2e-4650-aa5d-e53448e627d0-0
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.400
There's one of the kind of
carriages has.

8e5d45e3-5156-438b-b761-b3e987b1e578-0
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.359
Detached from the horses,
there's a man trying to rein in

8e5d45e3-5156-438b-b761-b3e987b1e578-1
00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:34.980
the horses.

1c44e17d-bbff-4c58-9b03-a8054016aef7-0
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.230
But there's four. It looks like
4 four groups of those.

2666e25d-33b2-498e-9ec3-7c625d2d8d14-0
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.673
There's one horse that's riding
on the carriage while being

2666e25d-33b2-498e-9ec3-7c625d2d8d14-1
00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:47.940
pulled by Foreman.

e6d0b5f9-b0cf-47d7-a143-9bc24d11b254-0
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.513
And then you
can see a lot of hitting and

e6d0b5f9-b0cf-47d7-a143-9bc24d11b254-1
00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:58.220
action going on in the middle of
the ring as well. #END_ancient_rome 

69af2c20-e39f-41eb-8995-0413c6aa3060-0
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.990
OK, perfect. Let me see.

0a084c0a-e314-41d9-b000-a4e31f48fc19-0
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.890
Well, we have next.

3d026073-0efc-4e97-9d0e-a7c7491ea1fa-0
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.870
About today's.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.110
Or.

9df4e436-8d84-4514-b064-c655e2b9c211-0
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:22.400
OK.

3c3ccd9a-a00f-4789-a2a5-48f2c1bd7124-0
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.310
Next we have another complex
scene.

d5920d25-ed7e-45ae-ace9-9280d1418b4a-0
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.010
OK.

f5076c96-76f7-40a7-9740-d9134eec260f-0
00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:01.004
#START_campsite All right, this
scene appears to be kind of like

f5076c96-76f7-40a7-9740-d9134eec260f-1
00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:06.717
a campsite with like a a stream
or river that runs between two

f5076c96-76f7-40a7-9740-d9134eec260f-2
00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:12.430
sides. So the side on the top of
the page, it looks to be like

f5076c96-76f7-40a7-9740-d9134eec260f-3
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:18.052
RV's. There are different like
campers, and one has a red and

f5076c96-76f7-40a7-9740-d9134eec260f-4
00:08:18.052 --> 00:08:21.680
white striped awning that's
pulled out.

101366dc-27ce-4b9a-9937-943c2f2f45cd-0
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.730
Umm.

5a6000f3-793c-44d6-8a31-a609e4d3be46-0
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.382
There are like kind of shrubs or
bushes around a walkway between.

5a6000f3-793c-44d6-8a31-a609e4d3be46-1
00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:37.883
So there's the bushes are
between the camping area with

5a6000f3-793c-44d6-8a31-a609e4d3be46-2
00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:43.580
the RV campers and a walkway
that goes next to the river.

9b65b17a-d4cf-4a6a-a8b6-e6dd253dce28-0
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:51.045
And it looks like there might be
a Boy Scout troop towards the

9b65b17a-d4cf-4a6a-a8b6-e6dd253dce28-1
00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:54.590
right side of that screen down
below.

783a0df4-b8a7-444f-a7e6-5fcdcdfe592d-0
00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:01.372
The stream there seems to be
tent campers, so there are

783a0df4-b8a7-444f-a7e6-5fcdcdfe592d-1
00:09:01.372 --> 00:09:06.946
multiple tents, different
colors, green, red, blue,

783a0df4-b8a7-444f-a7e6-5fcdcdfe592d-2
00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:14.020
yellow, brown. Different campers
there. Some are setting up camp,

783a0df4-b8a7-444f-a7e6-5fcdcdfe592d-3
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.700
others are playing music.

4edebd5c-1334-4115-8cee-ca8292be2902-0
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.320
There are some that appear to be
kind of just gathered around.

e7fef2c0-1322-4e10-a96d-018db34dba96-0
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:30.061
There is a bridge between that's
going over the the stream.

e7fef2c0-1322-4e10-a96d-018db34dba96-1
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:35.685
People are walking on that to
the left hand side of the tent

e7fef2c0-1322-4e10-a96d-018db34dba96-2
00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:41.770
camp, and they're also like kind
of a dividing line of shrubs and

e7fef2c0-1322-4e10-a96d-018db34dba96-3
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.260
then a sidewalk or walkway.

7d1a9b4b-eaaa-4f00-a28f-f67ebbb01776-0
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.775
With people walking back and
forth to the left of that, there

7d1a9b4b-eaaa-4f00-a28f-f67ebbb01776-1
00:09:51.775 --> 00:09:57.171
is a section that has it looks
like a bowl and a donkey and

7d1a9b4b-eaaa-4f00-a28f-f67ebbb01776-2
00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:59.870
with a couple people in there.

2c05703d-c0bf-4adc-a532-8ed530e257f2-0
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.851
And then further to the left,
there's another sidewalk, and it

2c05703d-c0bf-4adc-a532-8ed530e257f2-1
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:08.090
looks like a building of some
sort that's cut off.

004b1bbe-0d80-4d84-81ec-5adb2215900f-0
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.730


235a30c7-af12-42ed-9074-df38d9dbc595-0
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.128
Over to back up to the like RV
campers, there's one on the top

235a30c7-af12-42ed-9074-df38d9dbc595-1
00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:21.900
right that seems to be smoking
or something coming out of it

235a30c7-af12-42ed-9074-df38d9dbc595-2
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.985
and and then people also walking
on a sidewalk that's just above

235a30c7-af12-42ed-9074-df38d9dbc595-3
00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:31.913
that camping area with the RV's.
And in the background there's

235a30c7-af12-42ed-9074-df38d9dbc595-4
00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:36.998
kind of like rolling hills with
trees and shrubs and you can see

235a30c7-af12-42ed-9074-df38d9dbc595-5
00:10:36.998 --> 00:10:38.250
the green grass.

c4da0823-2aca-43ad-aa72-af7e72473d8e-0
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.860
And.

73af33ed-15dc-411d-b28a-4e989bea2c3d-0
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.715
And then all of
the camping areas have green

73af33ed-15dc-411d-b28a-4e989bea2c3d-1
00:10:46.715 --> 00:10:50.490
grass that it's on several
people on the sidewalks, on the

73af33ed-15dc-411d-b28a-4e989bea2c3d-2
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.050
walkways and also in the camping
areas. #END_campsite

fba70c53-adbf-46ac-be26-872fdeae617f-0
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.310
OK. Thank you.

396eab5d-c536-44a7-b362-8c9885af9480-0
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.080
OK, we have another complex
scene.

e120961a-1827-49ce-b480-6208c61bb965-0
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.660
OK. Yeah.

cc5ee682-2c0c-437b-9d98-40a16191dbce-0
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:34.390
OK. Can you see my screen? Yeah.
When you're ready, you could

cc5ee682-2c0c-437b-9d98-40a16191dbce-1
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:40.429
begin. #START_wild_west All
right. And so this scene looks

cc5ee682-2c0c-437b-9d98-40a16191dbce-2
00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:46.367
to be a very crowded scene,
maybe like a Western. So there

cc5ee682-2c0c-437b-9d98-40a16191dbce-3
00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:49.790
are saloon fronts, hotel in
jail.

0a7c2626-261d-4141-8438-35d1b5515dce-0
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.170
And.

2bc489ec-58c0-4a66-b193-7cb9447a5d5a-0
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.740
Bank looks like a stable.

93fbad09-22ce-48bd-ae32-b222325dcdb7-0
00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.282
So kind of all of these little
buildings, you know, next to

93fbad09-22ce-48bd-ae32-b222325dcdb7-1
00:12:01.282 --> 00:12:02.080
each other.

dba0b67d-f5b9-4f67-ab77-165eb019f046-0
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.730
No real space in between.

de5610c1-e9da-418e-a574-1e419a175cf3-0
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.050
Umm.

d5b89661-0997-4de7-97e4-bc5a6214a457-0
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.564
It looks like a a set, so
there's like open space inside

d5b89661-0997-4de7-97e4-bc5a6214a457-1
00:12:16.564 --> 00:12:19.390
and above all of the buildings.

d013931a-9270-4c77-8aba-8077991cae90-0
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.060
There are people.

9b95a76d-5191-4610-bc6d-c64aa6a67bb9-0
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:32.096
In each of the buildings, kind
of hanging out on the balconies,

9b95a76d-5191-4610-bc6d-c64aa6a67bb9-1
00:12:32.096 --> 00:12:38.039
up and down the stairs to the
far right, it looks like a train

9b95a76d-5191-4610-bc6d-c64aa6a67bb9-2
00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:42.190
that is kind of, you know,
billowing smoke.

41f74653-e626-49c6-bb46-95e0d38c516e-0
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.960
All of the.

1043d42f-1df3-479e-a79c-a61d44885cd3-0
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.213
Kind of storefronts or saloon
fronts are different colors, so

1043d42f-1df3-479e-a79c-a61d44885cd3-1
00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:57.420
blue, red, green, yellow.

15717faa-0027-4e80-85ac-bd94bec59c52-0
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.870
There are horses in the stable
area.

58c39e85-6612-4b6a-ba6a-16ed95592daa-0
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:14.647
It looks like to the right of
the stable there's a crowd of

58c39e85-6612-4b6a-ba6a-16ed95592daa-1
00:13:14.647 --> 00:13:20.357
people and a scene kind of
painted of the sun setting, and

58c39e85-6612-4b6a-ba6a-16ed95592daa-2
00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:24.809
they seem to be waving to a man
on the horse.

fd3691fe-1f38-4680-b558-498149cb0a16-0
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.550
To the left of that, as a saloon
that has a band and kind of on

fd3691fe-1f38-4680-b558-498149cb0a16-1
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.610
the upper balcony, there are
people inside.

fdc2b96c-4b75-4f0a-8539-e98b6ebd057f-0
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.856
There is another saloon below
that with people on the balcony

fdc2b96c-4b75-4f0a-8539-e98b6ebd057f-1
00:13:40.856 --> 00:13:45.421
as well. There are people kind
of climbing from the ground

fdc2b96c-4b75-4f0a-8539-e98b6ebd057f-2
00:13:45.421 --> 00:13:50.217
level to the second level and
then up on the roof of the bank

fdc2b96c-4b75-4f0a-8539-e98b6ebd057f-3
00:13:50.217 --> 00:13:55.091
that is against the saloon. It
seems they're painting the side

fdc2b96c-4b75-4f0a-8539-e98b6ebd057f-4
00:13:55.091 --> 00:14:00.120
of that building, the brick, and
they're painting from yellow to

fdc2b96c-4b75-4f0a-8539-e98b6ebd057f-5
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.430
red.

07d86262-59f6-4e20-9519-df5483276577-0
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.830
And on the other corner is a
saloon as well.

6a78d336-596f-437b-9a94-a3df7d68a016-0
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.210
At the bottom of the page it
looks like.

2f94d392-933e-44f1-8dbf-e57e96b26877-0
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.593
Like cut outs of Buffalo that
are kind of lined up down the

2f94d392-933e-44f1-8dbf-e57e96b26877-1
00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:20.240
street.

fa42d0d7-8c6d-4c87-a148-904c44a74aad-0
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.465
So there are people just
everywhere. There's a jail with

fa42d0d7-8c6d-4c87-a148-904c44a74aad-1
00:14:28.465 --> 00:14:30.740
bars and a wanted poster.

436a3f13-5002-43be-9150-21a50d044add-0
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.060
And then?

274df203-b777-4315-8298-743bf5780efa-0
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.140
Another like hotel and saloon in
that row.

6242aaeb-b8a8-4279-92d8-694adb5937c7-0
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.550
And people on the 1st and second
floors of the that.

a405bbcf-cc5f-479c-98ae-55eed5a29440-0
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.245
And then towards
the back there's a few it looks

a405bbcf-cc5f-479c-98ae-55eed5a29440-1
00:14:48.245 --> 00:14:49.390
like covered wagons as well. #END_wild_west 

6d78440b-5880-4c17-981a-ce73989646bc-0
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.670
Sounds good. Thank you.

10cf9f49-3d12-4304-bc43-cddf3b7c7915-0
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.570
OK, we have another complex
scene.

f6a5f7e4-36ab-4fe8-b143-9ca95004f06d-0
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.770
Oh wait, I have to like.

1b0cf986-aa02-4079-bb93-a7fcc45caa98-0
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.030
Sometimes when I share it.

5a20e215-890e-4a1b-95ab-1d69bfe64d4c-0
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.714
If I want to try to make it
bigger, I have to like make it

5a20e215-890e-4a1b-95ab-1d69bfe64d4c-1
00:15:29.714 --> 00:15:31.440
bigger first as well, yeah?

54ef8a59-146f-475f-9dde-39585210ba87-0
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.390
There we go.

4ec38474-b973-4da5-be43-af7feb569223-0
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.550
Do you see it OK?

1b30c492-7c39-4c84-ada2-47a1444f6c04-0
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.567
#START_make_a_splash This is a
water park. It looks like the

1b30c492-7c39-4c84-ada2-47a1444f6c04-1
00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:46.384
main kind of center of the
picture is a pool. It's very

1b30c492-7c39-4c84-ada2-47a1444f6c04-2
00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:48.770
crowded. A lot of people in
there.

c455091d-5c76-4ad0-bf17-28b28fc72b28-0
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.360
Umm.

b7233e5f-6aa7-408c-97b3-818a6df38ebf-0
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.187
It seems like they're kind of
stepping stones or like floating

b7233e5f-6aa7-408c-97b3-818a6df38ebf-1
00:15:57.187 --> 00:15:59.230
things to to walk on.

0fa6a2af-81f0-430d-9003-ad412697a907-0
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.606
In the pool there's several
people just swimming and some

0fa6a2af-81f0-430d-9003-ad412697a907-1
00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.720
that have floats that they're
in.

21d7767e-8b96-4e47-8ca7-32c2314027f6-0
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:14.485
To the left of that, there are
three water slides. That kind

21d7767e-8b96-4e47-8ca7-32c2314027f6-1
00:16:14.485 --> 00:16:14.760
of.

9fe9f2d5-726b-4fb6-bed4-920bce4bf0c1-0
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.617
Loop around, there's green,
yellow and red and they all go

9fe9f2d5-726b-4fb6-bed4-920bce4bf0c1-1
00:16:20.617 --> 00:16:22.200
into that main pool.

b9ed4d18-4f80-4598-9461-666319e8416d-0
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.126
There are several people on the
water slides at once and then

b9ed4d18-4f80-4598-9461-666319e8416d-1
00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:32.882
kind of above and to the left
there people in line waiting to

b9ed4d18-4f80-4598-9461-666319e8416d-2
00:16:32.882 --> 00:16:34.340
go down the slides.

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-0
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.721
Towards the bottom of the
screen, it kind of looks like

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-1
00:16:39.721 --> 00:16:44.594
the Kitty area. There's a big
pink elephant spraying water and

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-2
00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:49.389
it looks like a lazy river sort
of thing. So everyone is on a

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-3
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:53.875
yellow float going down this
lazy river. There's a bridge

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-4
00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:58.594
that connects kind of a walkway
to the left side of the Lazy

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-5
00:16:58.594 --> 00:17:03.621
river over it and to the right,
and that has a walkway that kind

9a61c073-b36e-40b2-8015-5c128548d69e-6
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:05.709
of leads to that main pool.

fa1fdd59-6ca1-4b3b-99ab-114459df148c-0
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.550
Umm.

adb26e1e-6c0c-459d-b5a7-74bb20b8322e-0
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.902
On the right side of the main
pool, it looks like two large

adb26e1e-6c0c-459d-b5a7-74bb20b8322e-1
00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:20.161
balls that are green, one green,
one red with white spots on

adb26e1e-6c0c-459d-b5a7-74bb20b8322e-2
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:25.592
them, and then a floating snake.
It looks like that people are

adb26e1e-6c0c-459d-b5a7-74bb20b8322e-3
00:17:25.592 --> 00:17:30.506
kind of climbing on. There also
is a set of kind of wavy

adb26e1e-6c0c-459d-b5a7-74bb20b8322e-4
00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:34.300
straight slides that go into the
main pool.

81658831-76d7-46cc-8de5-d260a9e400e5-0
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.153
So it looks like six of those
all connected red, orange,

81658831-76d7-46cc-8de5-d260a9e400e5-1
00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:44.705
yellow, green, blue and purple,
and people going down those

81658831-76d7-46cc-8de5-d260a9e400e5-2
00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:47.360
slides as well into the main
pool.

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-0
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.243
On the upper side of the main
pole there's like a dragon um

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-1
00:17:53.243 --> 00:17:57.036
that's belly is curled up and
then its head is out of the

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-2
00:17:57.036 --> 00:18:00.828
water and it looks like it's
kind of blowing water out of

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-3
00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:04.883
there. Above that is a pirate
ship and that people are all on

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-4
00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:09.133
the ship, and there's one large
wide yellow slide that goes into

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-5
00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:13.253
the main pool. The ship is also
spraying water out to the main

acfc33d1-88c3-4b15-8c2f-cb6dac9dd2a1-6
00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:13.580
pool.

76df82a0-b33a-4791-b627-5b8c6da08684-0
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.026
And then the
Lazy River is kind of a it wraps

76df82a0-b33a-4791-b627-5b8c6da08684-1
00:18:19.026 --> 00:18:22.948
around the pirate ship,
underneath the the slides that

76df82a0-b33a-4791-b627-5b8c6da08684-2
00:18:22.948 --> 00:18:26.942
are covered and loop and then
back to the bottom of the

76df82a0-b33a-4791-b627-5b8c6da08684-3
00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:28.939 
picture where the bridge is. #END_make_a_splash 

2e68118e-bf64-4311-80ff-3c4657a41c58-0
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.230
OK, perfect.

848b8417-7be6-4033-919b-4021490405b8-0
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.210
Let me stop sharing that one
and pull up the next one.

3ea802c9-c308-4610-b9cd-2e31fc714c6b-0
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.250
OK, Next is a short story.

edf2099c-6a01-4fe6-ae84-98c4e13441cb-0
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.303
So like before, like last week
when you do the short story when

edf2099c-6a01-4fe6-ae84-98c4e13441cb-1
00:18:54.303 --> 00:18:58.183
you're done with a slide. Let me
know if you'd like me to flip

edf2099c-6a01-4fe6-ae84-98c4e13441cb-2
00:18:58.183 --> 00:18:58.430
it.

a649f75e-9237-43d8-9720-8df16063f4ed-0
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.060
OK, this one is 3 slides long.

1067d05b-3650-46eb-bc1f-2889559ac239-0
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.870
And I will.

44da6fe5-5625-4a41-870d-8bd0fcf96822-0
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.370
Share my screen.

3281f1e8-9b11-4a2e-97cd-170cef928bb0-0
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.540
OK.

9c7f816f-88b5-40da-8c57-bb5d7c584127-0
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:41.412
#START_arrival_2 All right, so
this appears to be a man that is

9c7f816f-88b5-40da-8c57-bb5d7c584127-1
00:19:41.412 --> 00:19:45.110
on a ship boat of some kind.

52c09b3d-d7e3-4b7b-b0d7-756b81734cbb-0
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.500
There are.

e264ffc6-b499-44a8-8284-78fa0674436c-0
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.620
Flying birds above the boat.

3ff0629d-1998-4ff9-bc7a-f0ca2edfa32e-0
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.800
They're little scenes of the man
writing something in a journal.

3ff0629d-1998-4ff9-bc7a-f0ca2edfa32e-1
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.025
He takes it, he rips the page,
and he makes a little like bird

3ff0629d-1998-4ff9-bc7a-f0ca2edfa32e-2
00:20:05.025 --> 00:20:06.270
origami figure.

f6518ff5-b266-468f-a11a-1d3870d4c2db-0
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.844
And then he's looking up in the
sky, presumably at all these

f6518ff5-b266-468f-a11a-1d3870d4c2db-1
00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:12.360
flying.

6302d218-6398-4362-92f3-35ea3d3ca491-0
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.000
Birds that kind of have long
tails and big wings. They're

6302d218-6398-4362-92f3-35ea3d3ca491-1
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.130
white {next.}

0e026407-dd07-430f-b9bc-81c7786b0dd4-0
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.742
And so now the scene of the
boat. It looks like there are

0e026407-dd07-430f-b9bc-81c7786b0dd4-1
00:20:32.742 --> 00:20:37.330
pulling into a Bay. There are
large statues with.

bd96aaaf-5754-4496-8532-09b9bfb5f61e-0
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.010
Two men kind of shaking hands.
One has.

198796e7-c0f5-4ee1-970b-95f8af868cd3-0
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.830
And maybe it looks like a.

c7881644-ec07-465a-8ccd-6e1002b35455-0
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.556
Kind of rabbit. Rabbit rodent
type of figure and the other has

c7881644-ec07-465a-8ccd-6e1002b35455-1
00:20:51.556 --> 00:20:55.365
a a bird on him and it looks
like they are arriving at the

c7881644-ec07-465a-8ccd-6e1002b35455-2
00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:57.560
destination in the bay
somewhere.

92d5dee3-4999-4598-bad2-2ee67dcc8531-0
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.070
{Next.}

d67f3ef0-dc13-4a01-9f64-36936a038e9d-0
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:07.315
And so now it
looks like the ship has arrived

d67f3ef0-dc13-4a01-9f64-36936a038e9d-1
00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:11.896
and the people are getting off
and you know it's a crowded

d67f3ef0-dc13-4a01-9f64-36936a038e9d-2
00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:16.554
situation, so they're very
slowly getting off the ship. The

d67f3ef0-dc13-4a01-9f64-36936a038e9d-3
00:21:16.554 --> 00:21:20.980
man has his suitcases luggage
and they are walking away.

11435488-57e3-4abf-94f2-cc2d61d17dc2-0
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.610
That's it. #END_arrival_2 

98523907-43c8-42ed-8d4f-86735da62f36-0
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.430
Oh my. I'm sorry, I can't hear
you. Is it?

f796c9ce-520b-4065-a614-526e6dc7a8c6-0
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.620
This is another short story and
it's 20 slides, same thing as

f796c9ce-520b-4065-a614-526e6dc7a8c6-1
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.870
before. When you would like me
to move on, I'll click and move

f796c9ce-520b-4065-a614-526e6dc7a8c6-2
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.410
on, OK?

fa18c991-5c1e-423e-b208-766567449325-0
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.653
#START_journey Right. There's a
little girl sitting outside her

fa18c991-5c1e-423e-b208-766567449325-1
00:22:19.653 --> 00:22:20.120
apartment.

defebe5d-b578-435b-a5fa-19c01d3acf58-0
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.142
Everything is kind of Gray with
this one little scooter is is

defebe5d-b578-435b-a5fa-19c01d3acf58-1
00:22:25.142 --> 00:22:25.390
red.

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-0
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.586
And she's sitting on the corner
by herself, kind of on the

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-1
00:22:31.586 --> 00:22:35.790
stoop, and it looks like she is
pretty lonely as she slumped

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-2
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.719
over. Maybe she's sad or
reflecting on something. And it

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-3
00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:44.199
looks like her mom is inside in
the kitchen, her dad is upstairs

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-4
00:22:44.199 --> 00:22:48.541
in his office working, and her
sibling is upstairs, like on on

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-5
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:52.952
the couch by themselves across
from her. It looks like there is

3979c0cc-445a-41e7-a124-9e2a01fa6fd7-6
00:22:52.952 --> 00:22:56.950
a group of kids kind of playing,
but but she's all alone.

58c85485-8a98-4b8c-8052-c1b273f98ea6-0
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.350
{Next.}

3a83cd5e-700c-465d-b785-112edbad8bce-0
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.480


48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-0
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.372
She has this scooter inside and
the kitchen, her moms on the

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-1
00:23:09.372 --> 00:23:13.691
phone, not paying any attention
to her. She kind of goes in to

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-2
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:17.942
see her dad, who's working on
his computer, and he's also not

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-3
00:23:17.942 --> 00:23:22.193
paying attention to her. She has
a red kite and then she also

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-4
00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:26.444
goes to see her siblings on the
couch and she's leaning over.

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-5
00:23:26.444 --> 00:23:30.557
And her sister also wasn't
paying any attention to her. She

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-6
00:23:30.557 --> 00:23:34.877
has a red balloon, and so she
goes to her room and sits in her

48362026-0520-4653-92d9-bce26e34c48c-7
00:23:34.877 --> 00:23:35.220
room.

26b08a4d-3062-4783-8ef3-fc02c4709302-0
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:35.950
By herself

38a0c682-e54b-41db-bee6-8b236e3d15e9-0
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.330
Even the cat is kind of curled
up in the corner and not with

38a0c682-e54b-41db-bee6-8b236e3d15e9-1
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.070
her at all.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.950
Then she.

edaa2189-bca4-4244-86c1-7f6bb8752b75-0
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.980
Finds a red.

62dac2fc-00ab-4f1d-b452-7ad3902011c6-0
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:58.837
Marker on the floor in her
bedroom and she draws on the

62dac2fc-00ab-4f1d-b452-7ad3902011c6-1
00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:03.880
wall a doorway and it looks like
that doorway.

cc6174cd-eef0-4115-9970-b63adbbb0fe4-0
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.128
She draws a door, and then that
door opens and leads somewhere

cc6174cd-eef0-4115-9970-b63adbbb0fe4-1
00:24:09.128 --> 00:24:11.130
else, and so she leaves her
room.

b73a22cb-a58a-46a8-b228-89d8b892ef3f-0
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:17.944
{Next,} that doorway has opened
up into a magical forest, and

b73a22cb-a58a-46a8-b228-89d8b892ef3f-1
00:24:17.944 --> 00:24:23.596
there are several trees with
lanterns and lights on, strings

b73a22cb-a58a-46a8-b228-89d8b892ef3f-2
00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:24.429
dangling.

65d4d957-4332-40e5-a91c-e317a56b4318-0
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.910
And a little stream that.

e62aaa77-b437-409c-b1c5-aa21f5e472af-0
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.790
That goes through the forest.

fd7a1418-4c77-486e-b1af-27b70f27a003-0
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.080
{Next.}

8301a517-cb19-4b6f-9f20-10f10f1ecc65-0
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.310
The little girl finds a dock

e6311a3b-8518-40ba-a0c7-a11a25f004ce-0
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.692
In the stream and she still has
her red marker and so she leans

e6311a3b-8518-40ba-a0c7-a11a25f004ce-1
00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:49.530
over and draws a red boat and
she gets in the boat.

6ef0f1e9-f01b-467a-82e5-03ae3479952c-0
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.110
{Next.}

1a31bd12-7970-489e-b302-be21f4e8975f-0
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:58.278
She takes this boat up the
stream and she comes upon a huge

1a31bd12-7970-489e-b302-be21f4e8975f-1
00:24:58.278 --> 00:25:01.400
castle with several golden domes
and.

a52e9c98-f656-47e1-bb7a-46fa15f4d040-0
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.134
It looks like she's going
towards kind of the Moat that

a52e9c98-f656-47e1-bb7a-46fa15f4d040-1
00:25:06.134 --> 00:25:07.480
goes around the castle.

618247fc-72ad-4170-9fed-8087678220e2-0
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.300
{Next.}

5d703aa7-a71f-42a0-ad6a-a2a3abbb1692-0
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.288
So it looks like she's riding
through on this boat and all of

5d703aa7-a71f-42a0-ad6a-a2a3abbb1692-1
00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:19.960
these waterways that go.

383f5330-fb47-43d6-90d5-68ee9239ecd4-0
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.940
Through the outside of the
castle, there are a few.

78fd43ef-1f72-4d45-89f9-04669c345d47-0
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.320
It looks like guards that she
encounters.

2c2f6aa3-c2c8-4f50-b78f-f4bb4c54a8a2-0
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.400
And kind of different.

403e9da2-0cee-4b72-bdb7-4d9749922250-0
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.510
Almost like a traffic pattern
with.

2cf6ab6c-fca8-4150-82ef-8587a78e9269-0
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.870
With this water system next.

29df0fc7-85e7-4875-8307-9edf2a57a940-0
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.010
And so she comes to the edge of

93232bdd-2085-4bc3-afcd-d171eee064d5-0
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.350
The kind of.

f4e0c3f4-1aae-45db-9a26-9819351930c7-0
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.961
Stream that she's in and and she
falls out of the boat because

f4e0c3f4-1aae-45db-9a26-9819351930c7-1
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:05.524
it's a big waterfall. So with
her red marker she is drawing

f4e0c3f4-1aae-45db-9a26-9819351930c7-2
00:26:05.524 --> 00:26:09.140
something else as she falls down
next.

bf2550cd-d99c-491f-81b4-45542305e02c-0
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.939
She's drawn a big red hot air
balloon and so now she's taking

bf2550cd-d99c-491f-81b4-45542305e02c-1
00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:23.731
off in the sky in her balloon
and you can see that she's above

bf2550cd-d99c-491f-81b4-45542305e02c-2
00:26:23.731 --> 00:26:25.110
and the castle.

e4899dea-2fba-45e3-b186-21c1fdfb6f54-0
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.177
And she's flying next to this
other space craft that looks

e4899dea-2fba-45e3-b186-21c1fdfb6f54-1
00:26:31.177 --> 00:26:33.020
like a couple blimps.

ec5c3d93-61d4-4f4b-a155-45c7fc250dcd-0
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.514
And, you know, high amongst
looks like there's a bird with

ec5c3d93-61d4-4f4b-a155-45c7fc250dcd-1
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:39.200
her next.

bd6b3db2-0bba-4f11-8346-47e9e63176a9-0
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.720
So now you can see into these
other.

5d0b2127-7b01-496a-8c1c-1e12ac4fb5fe-0
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:54.824
Blimp kind of shifts, and one of
the men on that is trying to

5d0b2127-7b01-496a-8c1c-1e12ac4fb5fe-1
00:26:54.824 --> 00:26:57.100
catch this purple bird.

01adc431-2d07-4c04-b587-05f764de63d0-0
00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.540
And the girl is just watching
this {next.}

8f0a8f04-43b2-481c-9cbd-27ccd48454c0-0
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:11.090
She comes upon a large air
vessel.

47c73385-afd1-4c3e-9028-0f087d95fceb-0
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.760
Umm.

77c3c770-7c69-4bd9-b099-5bb7ebc6209f-0
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.640
Then it.

47487c0c-69e0-4d4d-ad00-e9624ee14e66-0
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.018
It doesn't seem that there are
many people on it, but there are

47487c0c-69e0-4d4d-ad00-e9624ee14e66-1
00:27:21.018 --> 00:27:23.550
a couple on the deck outside
{next.}

92c1dea3-6d85-476a-a10b-ddd65934c22d-0
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:34.566
So she lands her hot air balloon
on this large vessel and she

92c1dea3-6d85-476a-a10b-ddd65934c22d-1
00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:40.362
starts to explore. And she found
finds that there is a golden

92c1dea3-6d85-476a-a10b-ddd65934c22d-2
00:27:40.362 --> 00:27:41.110
kind of.

e80cb3d2-5ac2-4e66-9630-7ae164bad4e3-0
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.862
Platform that she climbs up and
there are two soldiers that are

e80cb3d2-5ac2-4e66-9630-7ae164bad4e3-1
00:27:46.862 --> 00:27:51.220
standing guard and this purple
bird is in a golden cage.

94d563f7-51e3-456d-9710-5fb6b8a4f27a-0
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:52.840
{Next.}

5a80826d-63c2-448f-be0b-c7e9c4ee49c3-0
00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.800
She takes the cage with the bird
and the soldiers are surprised

5a80826d-63c2-448f-be0b-c7e9c4ee49c3-1
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.751
they're going to chase after
her, but she runs to the back of

5a80826d-63c2-448f-be0b-c7e9c4ee49c3-2
00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:11.942
this vessel and she releases the
bird and she freezes it so that

5a80826d-63c2-448f-be0b-c7e9c4ee49c3-3
00:28:11.942 --> 00:28:13.220
it can fly away.

999ef655-8975-4673-bb24-6862faf3bcc2-0
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.450
{Next.}

a0c79435-c4db-4167-b592-634811564444-0
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.970
Now the guards capture her.

deff17db-5ecf-4daf-ad17-1b7ebbfa37ce-0
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.160
And they take her red marker and
they throw it overboard and now

deff17db-5ecf-4daf-ad17-1b7ebbfa37ce-1
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.497
they place her in a cage and
she's dangling at the back of

deff17db-5ecf-4daf-ad17-1b7ebbfa37ce-2
00:28:32.497 --> 00:28:32.950
this.

5feec740-c0c0-49be-93a4-99d30eb41fd1-0
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.230
This air vessel, she's in this
cage, dangling {next.}

f4763ca9-bad7-4c89-ac40-056b0e61ed32-0
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.040
So this purple bird has.

d4e9e8ee-a0f6-46b8-86b9-8a12d2843c5e-0
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:51.244
Collected her red marker when it
was thrown overboard and the

d4e9e8ee-a0f6-46b8-86b9-8a12d2843c5e-1
00:28:51.244 --> 00:28:55.646
bird brings it to the girl and
so now the girl can draw with

d4e9e8ee-a0f6-46b8-86b9-8a12d2843c5e-2
00:28:55.646 --> 00:29:00.337
the red marker and she has this
bird that has befriended her and

d4e9e8ee-a0f6-46b8-86b9-8a12d2843c5e-3
00:29:00.337 --> 00:29:01.419
is by her side.

f2524c0f-0fb1-4604-9dbf-c14a8faa817c-0
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:03.490
{Next.}

55f0f8b5-3111-4f48-94e6-b088c718b011-0
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.894
It looks like she has drawn a
magic flying carpet and so now

55f0f8b5-3111-4f48-94e6-b088c718b011-1
00:29:10.894 --> 00:29:13.600
she and the bird are flying.

cd145952-9f78-459a-9f9f-de33ef8133f1-0
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.080
Over.

456b5171-f6f5-41fc-9ef5-743b9572f10f-0
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.260
The town.

50af76ee-c51f-4c9a-ba6f-70c3b9e55214-0
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.750
{Next.}

4bddcabf-6471-4d1b-922e-78402dd4b462-0
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:26.020
They continue to fly at night
over.

f3d67dbf-6cdd-4bc8-8d27-c7208a26e653-0
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.518
Over the town and all the stars
are out and they're just

f3d67dbf-6cdd-4bc8-8d27-c7208a26e653-1
00:29:34.518 --> 00:29:38.350
enjoying this freedom that they
have next.

9b85e480-d6a2-4eb0-9948-e6b76f2dc8f3-0
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.500
Now she lands.

d2205f86-def2-4cc9-ba8d-91eff80f9c86-0
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:49.503
The carpets and she's found a
little door inside a palm tree

d2205f86-def2-4cc9-ba8d-91eff80f9c86-1
00:29:49.503 --> 00:29:54.572
and the bird has led her here
and it's purple just like the

d2205f86-def2-4cc9-ba8d-91eff80f9c86-2
00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:59.978
bird. So she is able to open the
door and the bird goes through

d2205f86-def2-4cc9-ba8d-91eff80f9c86-3
00:29:59.978 --> 00:30:03.020
and then she's going to go
explore.

d067f078-85e3-443c-bb6d-e5f7a89f52e6-0
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.310

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:14.103
She comes out and she exits what
is a mailbox back in her

862a29d7-31e4-40fb-bb48-eda8f3651403-1
00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:21.579
hometown, and the bird leads her
to this boy that has a purple

862a29d7-31e4-40fb-bb48-eda8f3651403-2
00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:23.360
marker. And so.

a692653c-c9d8-41eb-a376-b2d7c41d43c8-0
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:30.710
The girl and the boy are drawing
in red and purple and the bird.

862b994b-f1b4-4639-bf0b-e928b2fe61bf-0
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.660
Looks like knows the boy and his
friends with him.

17c491ba-4798-442d-b6f8-3844551b9e34-0
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:35.760

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.251
So together they
have drawn a tandem bike and now

8e12e9b2-e7f1-4c2f-a92c-9ebc9e152343-1
00:30:43.251 --> 00:30:47.670
they are gonna ride bikes
together and be friends next. #END_journey

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.937
OK, so this one's also a short
story and this 16 slides and I'm

294e9566-d955-42d1-b6b1-458511b7b6dd-1
00:31:19.937 --> 00:31:21.730
going to share my screen.

918ab120-b9ed-4d46-a842-95ad9d856ace-0
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.470
OK.

5008efc7-1333-406e-ac6f-3a14e6694bbc-0
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.770
#START_arrival_6 it looks like
there is a pot.

d2b3d48c-f828-4e4d-9f09-441ace4def3a-0
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.710
And a gentleman has.

36e89774-f165-443e-8505-66da891c2549-0
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:45.080
Written a letter and he's paying
to have it sent.

7f73e901-4c4e-4a5e-bda9-3b8052b31b6c-0
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.800
He puts a stamp on it and he
also folds up.

53295788-b961-4a8a-9d65-7c12ee63d7e3-0
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:57.460
The the letter is folded as
origami inside the envelope.

3ca6cdf1-8b5b-4ffe-a781-f969cddb1f60-0
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:03.469
And then he he includes the
stamp on that, and it looks like

3ca6cdf1-8b5b-4ffe-a781-f969cddb1f60-1
00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:08.799
he's taking it to be mailed. And
in the process he sees a woman

3ca6cdf1-8b5b-4ffe-a781-f969cddb1f60-2
00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:12.380
on the street and she's
directing him and.

2f0a79ef-828e-431b-a7db-3fe58702ab9a-0
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.564
He's kind of looking at this
machine and dropping the letter

2f0a79ef-828e-431b-a7db-3fe58702ab9a-1
00:32:18.564 --> 00:32:19.200
in next.

a1b4e3c3-8670-4933-bf96-e09cc8b96782-0
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.490
So this little leaf grows.

81c268c5-b964-4fe7-bead-a10f33246097-0
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.480
And becomes.

dcecaeb8-844d-47cf-9329-6661df49ab16-0
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.450
 a flower.

f9318b70-e711-42f3-95f7-959bebfb0c96-0
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:39.686
And you see it go through all of
the seasons. And so it starts

f9318b70-e711-42f3-95f7-959bebfb0c96-1
00:32:39.686 --> 00:32:44.890
out in the spring and the rain
and then it is suddenly in.

0e5c02b3-a35c-4aba-a5bf-5dbc8e317838-0
00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.930
The snow and the cold.

8f5bb817-7087-4814-9169-65029ecec45f-0
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.500

c99b5c27-b679-4c18-ab30-bf9b6e6c05d3-0
00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.290
There is a scene of city.

44f7f78b-83f0-4e23-89a0-fd772b7bc904-0
00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:06.385
That looks like everything is
covered in snow and it looks

44f7f78b-83f0-4e23-89a0-fd772b7bc904-1
00:33:06.385 --> 00:33:11.920
very cold and and not many
people out, but you can see the

44f7f78b-83f0-4e23-89a0-fd772b7bc904-2
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:17.080
kind of steam rising from all of
the like smokestacks.

27514231-f564-4e6b-ba8b-e7dd6eeccfe9-0
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.220
{Next.}

bdb41b72-ce6d-4e89-b14d-fbb4c61108c0-0
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:32.935
So this man is in his home, he's
sitting in bed and he's looking

bdb41b72-ce6d-4e89-b14d-fbb4c61108c0-1
00:33:32.935 --> 00:33:34.070
at a picture.

c72df427-cb3c-4825-9174-f6c1fa64eafb-0
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.555
And reminiscing, his little
creature friend is at his side

c72df427-cb3c-4825-9174-f6c1fa64eafb-1
00:33:40.555 --> 00:33:46.071
and suddenly runs down the
ladder. The man follows him and

c72df427-cb3c-4825-9174-f6c1fa64eafb-2
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:49.530
finds that he has received a
letter.

dc54fd09-cf79-47ea-91cc-0e6a7805bfe6-0
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.937
And so he opens the letter and
reads it, and this makes him

dc54fd09-cf79-47ea-91cc-0e6a7805bfe6-1
00:33:54.937 --> 00:33:56.840
very happy and he looks out.

2a2e1184-19a6-487b-b9ed-6c4a12d306f6-0
00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.860
And looks out of the window.

ecf6aad9-71c0-4317-ac60-8bef704e5eef-0

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.910
So you see an origami.

72fdfd1b-baab-483d-8965-3a704ee5a9ac-0
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:18.570
Figure in the shape of his
creature friend there is.

bde24f53-c766-42f4-a426-ebbd7e2f1228-0
00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.908
What looks to be like a
fireplace, a smoke, some sort of

bde24f53-c766-42f4-a426-ebbd7e2f1228-1
00:34:25.908 --> 00:34:31.754
heat source. There's a hat and a
coat hanging on a a rack on a

bde24f53-c766-42f4-a426-ebbd7e2f1228-2
00:34:31.754 --> 00:34:33.610
wall. There also is.

c43c1883-fbbc-4081-bfc7-4c31638d9df4-0
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.189
a dish prepared, it looks like
it kind of has squid in it in

c43c1883-fbbc-4081-bfc7-4c31638d9df4-1
00:34:40.189 --> 00:34:45.075
the bowl and there's a hand
drawn picture of like flying

c43c1883-fbbc-4081-bfc7-4c31638d9df4-2
00:34:45.075 --> 00:34:45.590
craft.

ad0823fa-c6cd-4fe6-ad2c-b4bd25e5d65e-0
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.140
There is what appears to be
maybe a.

7f4f8a31-ba34-4fdc-ac71-fef79e337583-0
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.800
petal of some sort and a cup of
tea and the family portrait of

7f4f8a31-ba34-4fdc-ac71-fef79e337583-1
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.939
this man, his wife and his
daughter. And then the man is

7f4f8a31-ba34-4fdc-ac71-fef79e337583-2
00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:08.709
giving a coin to a young child
and it looks like his daughter's

7f4f8a31-ba34-4fdc-ac71-fef79e337583-3
00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:09.160

This family is eating together.

c9c6ed90-6fd0-4219-b9a4-2e2a5e9fa380-0
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.840
At the table.

d7ab5871-4a26-4e13-9de7-f6ea746c9e48-0
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.100
And the creature is there, and
they all seem very happy.

f177da5b-16b6-4765-b066-c0c833bb6916-0
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:35.538
kinda sharing a
meal and smiling and telling

f177da5b-16b6-4765-b066-c0c833bb6916-1
00:35:35.538 --> 00:35:40.935
stories. And then the little
girl gets her boots and hat on,

f177da5b-16b6-4765-b066-c0c833bb6916-2
00:35:40.935 --> 00:35:46.067
and she and the creature go
outside and go exploring, and

f177da5b-16b6-4765-b066-c0c833bb6916-3
00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:51.729
she's running down the steps and
through the town and she finds

f177da5b-16b6-4765-b066-c0c833bb6916-4
00:35:51.729 --> 00:35:54.029
this little glowing light. #END_arrival_6

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:09.522
OK, let me see what's next
11-1. OK, NEXT is another short

2544a4a2-02e3-4d2c-b66b-99a85d7cf36b-1
00:36:09.522 --> 00:36:10.230
story.

0485c45c-a062-4d91-9c70-bd4fc661fdc8-0
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.810
This one is 20 slides.

6163ccda-720f-49f6-8ba1-679b2b25ef06-0
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.180
And I'm going to share my screen
now.

bf12d7ee-1a91-4bf1-aa41-6be5c305f261-0
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:37.080
OK, can you see my screen? OK,
perfect.

4df51c4e-e2c8-490e-a285-9e89b68ab9d4-0
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.620
#START_quest The little girl and
little boy and have been riding

4df51c4e-e2c8-490e-a285-9e89b68ab9d4-1
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.690
their bike around the city and
they're in a park and it starts

4df51c4e-e2c8-490e-a285-9e89b68ab9d4-2
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.180
to rain and so they're taking
shelter under a bridge.

9c4963da-145f-4e06-97bc-d95c8452f36a-0
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.170

e193e6df-baf5-441a-876e-a95600c94ec5-0
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.080
A door suddenly opens under this
bridge.

5677770a-e982-4de2-9608-ea86ab36a813-0
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.892
And there is a king that
appears, and he comes out and

5677770a-e982-4de2-9608-ea86ab36a813-1
00:37:06.892 --> 00:37:13.040
suddenly soldiers grab him and
take him back in the doorway.

ea72244c-4ffd-4c6e-bd23-ef77955ebdbe-0
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.880

And so the girl and the boy.

452bbfad-61b1-4668-91c5-75af18711472-0
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.650
Umm.

09c7fb55-e226-4475-b43e-b170552deac1-0
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:28.920
Draw. They use their red and
purple markers to draw keys, and

09c7fb55-e226-4475-b43e-b170552deac1-1
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.270
they're able to open the doorway
back up and go through next.

2ae03f3a-7f5b-480e-8132-518b12420cc9-0
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:44.073
So they come upon the king in a
boat being, you know, led away,

2ae03f3a-7f5b-480e-8132-518b12420cc9-1
00:37:44.073 --> 00:37:49.476
they're going next to this
castle, kind of in the the water

2ae03f3a-7f5b-480e-8132-518b12420cc9-2
00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:55.060
or moat that runs next to it.
And they're watching right now.

c410b475-9aae-4f66-adb6-4da708c2b2e7-0
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.440

1ba0adfa-cc66-4721-bbc5-095b89eb28a2-0
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.274
The king has left them a map of
sorts, and so they're looking at

1ba0adfa-cc66-4721-bbc5-095b89eb28a2-1
00:38:05.274 --> 00:38:09.490
the different areas that are
pointed out on this map.

871d271a-c4bf-42cb-94bf-fdea6d59dbb8-0

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.812
They watch as other soldiers
come down through through the

712574a0-e6ef-46fc-92ef-843722193554-1
00:38:22.812 --> 00:38:26.030
water on small boats and
together.

b9f51411-8980-4776-9246-c2846ef83dad-0
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.443
They draw different things, so
the boy, it looks like, is

b9f51411-8980-4776-9246-c2846ef83dad-1
00:38:30.443 --> 00:38:30.900
drawing.

6ebf8f77-f428-4867-9064-564efa3eda76-0
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:38.183
A squid or octopus, maybe a sea
creature with the tentacles and

6ebf8f77-f428-4867-9064-564efa3eda76-1
00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:42.847
the girl is drawing scuba gear
and so they jump in the water

6ebf8f77-f428-4867-9064-564efa3eda76-2
00:38:42.847 --> 00:38:43.230
next.

d98dde1a-c431-410b-98ac-97c83c81f7a5-0
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.895
So they're going underneath. It
looks like there's an

d98dde1a-c431-410b-98ac-97c83c81f7a5-1
00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:51.740
underwater.

7c644f4c-749a-4925-ade8-47732ed19c1b-0
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.973
City that they're going down
towards and the bird is also

7c644f4c-749a-4925-ade8-47732ed19c1b-1
00:38:55.973 --> 00:38:59.900
with them, so the three of them
are riding on this kind of squid

7c644f4c-749a-4925-ade8-47732ed19c1b-2
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.350
that's taking them down.

460a1a33-f8a6-4bea-91e6-488661ca2d1b-0

They come down and they find.

4ae9dd1b-8f80-496f-8e9e-356acfa337f4-0
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:16.319
A treasure in this underwater
area and and it looks like the

4ae9dd1b-8f80-496f-8e9e-356acfa337f4-1
00:39:16.319 --> 00:39:22.907
the guards have come down these
soldiers and they're underwater

4ae9dd1b-8f80-496f-8e9e-356acfa337f4-2
00:39:22.907 --> 00:39:27.540
as well and they spot them
taking something.

fdfc15de-82b1-42ab-a9f3-9ac557e5583f-0
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.660
And so the girl and the boy
start going.

1dd11229-ffd9-40e4-a2a1-4f4b03768c6c-0
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.200
Up towards the surface of the
water to get away.

f4c86ad4-e7ab-4046-bcd2-fe1eb99c29a4-0
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.760
{Next.}

f16bac1e-6d8a-4ee5-a0f9-1bd753152c57-0
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:43.490
So they come out of the water
and they have found an island

f16bac1e-6d8a-4ee5-a0f9-1bd753152c57-1
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.680
with palm trees.

0cb9d95a-1295-4c10-aa97-373cd4b3ba21-0
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.885
And the bird is with them and
they're taking off their scuba

0cb9d95a-1295-4c10-aa97-373cd4b3ba21-1
00:39:50.885 --> 00:39:54.030
gear and now they're drawing
something.

fd7386ff-65e8-49ff-82c4-14329772f839-0
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:55.360
{next}

8459dea9-3e6b-45f5-83f0-e255cc7d209b-0
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:04.490
They together drawn a rhinoceros
and.

4b0c4c2a-5f35-4d5e-b418-99f30eaea231-0
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:11.917
And kind of seat on top of it to
ride and they're going towards a

4b0c4c2a-5f35-4d5e-b418-99f30eaea231-1
00:40:11.917 --> 00:40:12.650
pyramid.

f8571bcd-971e-44c9-992b-9e669e154c81-0
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.950
{Next.}

060b6fb4-7c42-43e0-9f06-87f4e2eade8b-0
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.433
And so the bird is kind of
leading them and they come

060b6fb4-7c42-43e0-9f06-87f4e2eade8b-1
00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:24.240
across a walking bridge, so.

c72fe853-39ef-4006-a0de-906cd2f2a3e2-0
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:30.394
They're running over this
bridge. That is, they're going

c72fe853-39ef-4006-a0de-906cd2f2a3e2-1
00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:34.740
to a light that this bridge is
over the sea.

246553d3-644a-4c03-8107-876ddca97a0b-0
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:36.980
{Next.}

f0fde73e-c431-4cca-ad09-f36765a61122-0
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.909
So they get up to this light,
they climb up on the tower and

f0fde73e-c431-4cca-ad09-f36765a61122-1
00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:49.288
they can see that these soldiers
are still chasing after them.

f0fde73e-c431-4cca-ad09-f36765a61122-2
00:40:49.288 --> 00:40:53.389
And so again they're drawing
something else with their red

f0fde73e-c431-4cca-ad09-f36765a61122-3
00:40:53.389 --> 00:40:54.710
and purple markers.

8cc2b038-032e-4a26-8446-3958723d553d-0
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.000
{Next.}

51610326-df8f-4039-8b3e-f39d1592b8aa-0
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:05.223
So they've drawn a swing and a
giant dragonfly to carry them

51610326-df8f-4039-8b3e-f39d1592b8aa-1
00:41:05.223 --> 00:41:11.762
off. And so the girl and the boy
and the purple bird are escaping

51610326-df8f-4039-8b3e-f39d1592b8aa-2
00:41:11.762 --> 00:41:14.139
the soldiers again next.

9a563835-d446-4c2e-a7da-dc5a5c72f8e7-0
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.720
They come across

1f29662d-3c86-482d-9ad5-1bd1430e9818-0
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.230
another.

9cd2f888-720b-460a-8cf7-67dfb3ff2eee-0
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:30.266
Area, and they're getting off of
the swing on top of kind of a

9cd2f888-720b-460a-8cf7-67dfb3ff2eee-1
00:41:30.266 --> 00:41:35.338
tower on a mountain, and they
can see that the soldiers are

9cd2f888-720b-460a-8cf7-67dfb3ff2eee-2
00:41:35.338 --> 00:41:40.411
still after them. They have
blimp ships, and they're coming

9cd2f888-720b-460a-8cf7-67dfb3ff2eee-3
00:41:40.411 --> 00:41:45.822
after them. And so the girl and
the boy have found a whole belt

9cd2f888-720b-460a-8cf7-67dfb3ff2eee-4
00:41:45.822 --> 00:41:51.148
full of markers. And so now they
have several different colors

9cd2f888-720b-460a-8cf7-67dfb3ff2eee-5
00:41:51.148 --> 00:41:51.740
{next.}

1094e25e-aede-4098-9903-978dac9d7f96-0
00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.573
They're still on this tower and
there are more and more soldiers

1094e25e-aede-4098-9903-978dac9d7f96-1
00:42:00.573 --> 00:42:05.165
coming after them and they're
getting scared leaning on this

1094e25e-aede-4098-9903-978dac9d7f96-2
00:42:05.165 --> 00:42:08.929
tower and the bird is is trying
to distract them.

786fe01c-d55e-46bb-997b-6a48a0d5de6e-0
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.390
But the soldiers are coming and
trying to grab all of them next.

07ce1791-b918-4f1e-9022-de0159ef5dc3-0
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:23.059
So the bird has taken this belt
with all the colors, and there's

07ce1791-b918-4f1e-9022-de0159ef5dc3-1
00:42:23.059 --> 00:42:28.186
a rainbow going down to the
tower and through the sky, and

07ce1791-b918-4f1e-9022-de0159ef5dc3-2
00:42:28.186 --> 00:42:33.053
it's kind of knocking these
soldiers out of the way and

07ce1791-b918-4f1e-9022-de0159ef5dc3-3
00:42:33.053 --> 00:42:35.399
hitting there, their ships.

7365c0a8-5b01-4f0b-a8e0-5162a74007e9-0
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.820
Their aircraft and knocking them
down next.

6c471211-dc92-4f59-8b3b-553e6643375a-0
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:48.164
So this rainbow leads all the
way back to the ship that the

6c471211-dc92-4f59-8b3b-553e6643375a-1
00:42:48.164 --> 00:42:49.020
king is on.

e7eb0901-0090-48d2-a09a-18f4559843e5-0
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.440
From the mountain top down next
to the castle in the in the

e7eb0901-0090-48d2-a09a-18f4559843e5-1
00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.117
water and the soldiers are being
knocked off the ship and the the

e7eb0901-0090-48d2-a09a-18f4559843e5-2
00:43:01.117 --> 00:43:04.300
king is very happy and excited
next.

1b308bfb-06fb-420a-b227-713c2ab4aac1-0
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:16.169
So now you can still see this
rainbow that's over this place

1b308bfb-06fb-420a-b227-713c2ab4aac1-1
00:43:16.169 --> 00:43:21.851
with the palace, and the king
is, is running along. He's

1b308bfb-06fb-420a-b227-713c2ab4aac1-2
00:43:21.851 --> 00:43:28.229
victorious. He's riding on the
rhinoceros with the girl and the

1b308bfb-06fb-420a-b227-713c2ab4aac1-3
00:43:28.229 --> 00:43:31.219
boy parading through the city.

c96e1ac0-25b6-4b5a-9fdd-dbc65eecde40-0
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.040
{Next.}

fbc0cf37-c411-4c86-986a-84055d34496b-0
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:43.757
So they reach the area where the
girl and boy have entered this

fbc0cf37-c411-4c86-986a-84055d34496b-1
00:43:43.757 --> 00:43:48.376
town and the king leads them
back to that original door. He

fbc0cf37-c411-4c86-986a-84055d34496b-2
00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:53.303
came through and it looks like
he is saying his goodbyes to the

fbc0cf37-c411-4c86-986a-84055d34496b-3
00:43:53.303 --> 00:43:58.000
girl and the boy, but he is
handed a crown to the little boy

fbc0cf37-c411-4c86-986a-84055d34496b-4
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.004
that he has drawn to thank him.
And so now they're going back to

fbc0cf37-c411-4c86-986a-84055d34496b-5
00:44:03.004 --> 00:44:05.160
their own world with crowns.

e5b71d1a-96e6-47a8-abf1-d8f321538b4c-0
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:06.610
{Next.}

0e95bc3f-a38d-45de-a542-ea5ba1a5cf17-0
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:15.173
And when they get
back under the bridge, they look

0e95bc3f-a38d-45de-a542-ea5ba1a5cf17-1
00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:19.150
out and there's a rainbow that's
over their home city. #END_quest

3e43d439-90f3-4982-84e1-14553f525971-0

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.590
And let me see what we have
next.

c376dbc5-74e3-44b2-a0d6-491b64f8732f-0
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.070
OK, we have a complex scene.

257c0bfa-2cea-47bf-9a0e-56b459e9c365-0
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.010

Hey, I'm gonna wait.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.030
Going to share my screen.

a28fa4c9-1487-4db3-bc55-06c42901d9d3-0
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:18.624
OK, so this is just a complex
scene, so three to five minutes

a28fa4c9-1487-4db3-bc55-06c42901d9d3-1
00:45:18.624 --> 00:45:20.300
to describe what you see.

3d414df4-fb49-4376-aff3-3d59eb6a5bea-0
00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.967
#START_deep_sea_divers This is a
water scene. It looks like it is

3d414df4-fb49-4376-aff3-3d59eb6a5bea-1
00:45:25.967 --> 00:45:28.850

Some of the people seem to be
fishing, some have gotten out to

32d029e9-0ccf-4511-b0cd-e8c1cb356583-1
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:04.240

It's a crowded area.

d98c5fbf-c283-4561-8d76-35f21bdc3010-0

7ee1ef02-b28d-4a66-a2ee-59f185a2e59e-1
00:46:28.532 --> 00:46:29.550
something.

659458e3-6bd1-4add-ac7a-2f589b292782-0
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.836
There is one fish that is
chasing a man. It's a large pink

659458e3-6bd1-4add-ac7a-2f589b292782-1
00:46:35.836 --> 00:46:40.787
fish and the fish is holding a
net trying to capture this

659458e3-6bd1-4add-ac7a-2f589b292782-2
00:46:40.787 --> 00:46:42.580

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.730
people kind of walking around on
the sand bed.

00:47:04.142 --> 00:47:05.120
on the bottom.

97d01a57-62c5-4cbd-a0a8-a62e68f400b0-0
00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.640
Umm.

8f5a5c63-027e-4618-977a-91dab0b377ba-0
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.460
There are school of fish that
kind of make.

d2b0db7e-ece9-45ee-8dff-b53509c99471-0
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:20.216
Shape. So one shape is of the
outline of a fish and the other

d2b0db7e-ece9-45ee-8dff-b53509c99471-1
00:47:20.216 --> 00:47:21.620
is a smiley face

fd565a7b-d866-4c70-a7f6-c56155f75ff5-0
00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:26.443
That they have outlined. There
also are three arrows that they

fd565a7b-d866-4c70-a7f6-c56155f75ff5-1
00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:27.100
have made.

a9c3fa90-68e8-4336-a6b6-ad0049fb2dbe-0
00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.000
Underneath the water.

b5d0eb2b-4e55-4198-a14b-fc615c3058ad-0
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.700
And then several people.

b50de262-2d09-4074-8918-8fa798f624ae-0
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.160
I'm kind of going down. There's.

9e086622-f533-451c-a9a1-6565a605a6f6-0
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.499
It looks like a few people that
have kind of harpooned a fish

9e086622-f533-451c-a9a1-6565a605a6f6-1
00:47:41.499 --> 00:47:43.900
and the fish is pulling them
underneath.

059aa04a-2ebe-4187-84a5-1c0d88a263e7-0
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.650
Looks like 5 people that are
trying to to get this fish.

9743e5bb-a9ef-4e39-b7a6-18154beee8b6-0
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.788
Several
different colors, blue and

9743e5bb-a9ef-4e39-b7a6-18154beee8b6-1
00:47:55.788 --> 00:47:57.940
yellow and green and red fish
all around. #END_deep_sea_divers 

7f3bb93b-db37-4634-9fd2-a3c47a189bb9-0
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:15.900
I'm going to see what's next.
OK, another complex scene.

086e19a1-b0b2-47f6-9a05-17e176661baf-0
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.780
And I'll share my screen again.

2e7c669a-fc6b-4f0b-a701-a58f68ccf316-0
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:40.490
OK.

ecd84dca-e409-44c3-9e83-95b7847f07ec-0
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:47.680
#START_by_the_lake And so this
is a lake scene, so.

ff9c23ce-c2ac-4abd-ba35-a6e5917b631a-0
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.913
In the center of a picture is a
large Blue Lake, and it looks

ff9c23ce-c2ac-4abd-ba35-a6e5917b631a-1
00:48:52.913 --> 00:48:56.330
like there's kind of a beach
that wraps around it.

57913119-4444-4c38-89d8-5c008e466f7e-0
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.330
On the beach there are a lot of
people. There's a volleyball

57913119-4444-4c38-89d8-5c008e466f7e-1
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:08.101
net, so there are people playing
that game. There's a little boat

57913119-4444-4c38-89d8-5c008e466f7e-2
00:49:08.101 --> 00:49:09.619
that is docked there.

16cadab0-69b9-421c-b5f1-0080966c96a3-0
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:15.155
There are people flying a kite
and a lot of people, you know,

16cadab0-69b9-421c-b5f1-0080966c96a3-1
00:49:15.155 --> 00:49:18.800
in the sand playing and playing
with a soccer ball.

3b9a1ffa-6043-4008-895c-448b67e03394-0
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.220
There's someone riding

883e09ca-e452-4324-8f6b-a3b19e29811a-0
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.450
Riding the two wheeled.

199ea484-f158-4a52-9909-a3be97721ba9-0
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:33.000
Like scooter on there on the
beach there's a small dock.

3b38ac50-3e5c-408a-ba89-e43a6236516a-0
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:39.263
And it looks like one person is
fishing, a couple of people just

3b38ac50-3e5c-408a-ba89-e43a6236516a-1
00:49:39.263 --> 00:49:43.761
standing or sitting, and then
this beach kind of leads to a

3b38ac50-3e5c-408a-ba89-e43a6236516a-2
00:49:43.761 --> 00:49:47.210
path to a cabin in the upper
right hand side.

eab0a3be-7f3e-4d98-9968-763507518960-0
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:53.857
And there are a couple of people
at the cabin, kind of on the

eab0a3be-7f3e-4d98-9968-763507518960-1
00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:58.822
balcony, and then a group
outside overlooking the lake as

eab0a3be-7f3e-4d98-9968-763507518960-2
00:49:58.822 --> 00:50:03.787
well. So in the lake there are
people swimming. Some have

eab0a3be-7f3e-4d98-9968-763507518960-3
00:50:03.787 --> 00:50:09.008
flotation devices and like big 
rafts or the circular rafts.

eab0a3be-7f3e-4d98-9968-763507518960-4
00:50:09.008 --> 00:50:11.319
There's a couple in kayaks.

495aee21-7856-4e23-9687-231ef69e8b73-0
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.687
And in the middle of the lake
there is like a platform that

495aee21-7856-4e23-9687-231ef69e8b73-1
00:50:16.687 --> 00:50:20.140
several people are standing on
and jumping from.

4750f43e-828f-4364-9ab2-5830d7ab2338-0
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:24.640
And then out further in the
lake, it looks like.

18142e77-2baf-470a-b30f-beb7f5bf59c4-0
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:31.207
Boats are pulling skiers and one
group is they formed a large

18142e77-2baf-470a-b30f-beb7f5bf59c4-1
00:50:31.207 --> 00:50:36.507
pyramid that they're being
pulled by the boat and there's a

18142e77-2baf-470a-b30f-beb7f5bf59c4-2
00:50:36.507 --> 00:50:40.130
pair of sailors far out in the
distance.

cdf1f353-a121-4668-a84f-43b629516de8-0
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.863
To the left you can tell there's
a very like large castle and in

cdf1f353-a121-4668-a84f-43b629516de8-1
00:50:46.863 --> 00:50:47.810
the background.

01f28d4f-2097-4d09-9fb6-2f8a1add4828-0
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.980
Mountains with snow tops on on
that.

02cdc200-0016-4d83-93f0-4ac1e42eafc3-0
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.588
But crowds of
people, it looks like everyone

02cdc200-0016-4d83-93f0-4ac1e42eafc3-1
00:50:59.588 --> 00:51:01.160
is having fun on the lake. #END_by_the_lake

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.500
And.

4d42573b-492a-4d27-bd67-01c6da19b971-0
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.540
There is another. The next one
is a complex scene.

e709f82b-dc07-4a13-a0d9-c2190706eee6-0
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.300
OK oh wait, I need to.

0b93a800-8a07-4688-9038-d4d886393c0c-0
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.540
Slideshow from beginning.

5c5b2e31-544f-4f56-bb1d-00428b53ca66-0
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.320
OK.

1d97bfbe-ee4a-4ca9-9864-5358ab12b51f-0
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.120
Here you go.

ec693fe7-bd7e-469e-b442-4c572642f37f-0
00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.960
#START_unfriendly_giants And so
this scene has a lot of giants.

2ff292c5-6a1c-4c91-9595-fea2a66a7a96-0
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:58.630
And and they are kind of you can
tell that the houses.

fa96567a-cc4c-4c8a-9864-067bf3988557-0
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.260
And hats are are very small
compared to these large giants.

27543aeb-4ae1-4c4f-b4ef-61176b3a2e12-0
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:06.270
And.

560a6a57-95ba-4d65-9045-811ca54d7051-0
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.775
Towards the bottom of the scene
you can see people kind of

560a6a57-95ba-4d65-9045-811ca54d7051-1
00:52:12.775 --> 00:52:17.116
trying to run and get away from
the giants or fight them.

560a6a57-95ba-4d65-9045-811ca54d7051-2
00:52:17.116 --> 00:52:21.681
There's some with pitchforks and
the Giants are just kind of

560a6a57-95ba-4d65-9045-811ca54d7051-3
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:26.097
slapping them away, and there's
a group of giants that are

560a6a57-95ba-4d65-9045-811ca54d7051-4
00:52:26.097 --> 00:52:29.389
playing chess using these people
as pieces.

a062e800-14fd-4163-b4fa-b06768c74106-0
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:36.808
There is another group of giants
at the bottom. It looks like

a062e800-14fd-4163-b4fa-b06768c74106-1
00:52:36.808 --> 00:52:42.237
they have straws and they're
sucking the water sources up and

a062e800-14fd-4163-b4fa-b06768c74106-2
00:52:42.237 --> 00:52:45.390
then spraying the people with
that.

d71bed57-9e7e-4ce3-a848-ad5d89a3583f-0
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.960
And the people have.

bc50edf9-5acb-4e6f-97c3-62b1ed29c8c8-0
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.054
Built like a A contraption to
kind of hammer one of the Giants

bc50edf9-5acb-4e6f-97c3-62b1ed29c8c8-1
00:52:55.054 --> 00:52:57.540
on the head so he is crying out.

d5145ea7-6a4c-46f8-afa4-86d8f3161631-0
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:00.270
Um.

15b048fd-d3df-4425-957a-bc96ef910f3d-0
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.510
Towards the middle.

0c00b877-04fe-4a5d-abfc-1227e64dc9a4-0
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:10.373
It looks like they're trying to
kind of again, they've built

0c00b877-04fe-4a5d-abfc-1227e64dc9a4-1
00:53:10.373 --> 00:53:16.133
different towers to try to catch
the giants and hit them over the

0c00b877-04fe-4a5d-abfc-1227e64dc9a4-2
00:53:16.133 --> 00:53:21.718
head. And so one trap is a woman
that's built out of boards and

0c00b877-04fe-4a5d-abfc-1227e64dc9a4-3
00:53:21.718 --> 00:53:24.860
the giant is is taking her
flowers.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:31.396
There's also one giant that's
trying to rope an entire crowd

2992c15b-8831-4b51-a55e-d4bd35149edc-1
00:53:31.396 --> 00:53:33.520

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:41.532
And then at the top it looks
like they're kind of storming a

89f4a7ba-b16a-4eb5-ae54-3e08eefa8e74-1
00:53:41.532 --> 00:53:46.718
castle. There's a windmill that
the Giants are as tall as the

89f4a7ba-b16a-4eb5-ae54-3e08eefa8e74-2
00:53:46.718 --> 00:53:49.730

that.

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:58.339
And there are people all over,
just kind of the small people

bac3c23f-1af7-44d8-83fe-5d02512b3a5c-1
00:53:58.339 --> 00:53:59.550
like running.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.190
and trying to get away.

f7efa426-03cc-4ff8-8af8-8aa9e4d487e2-0
00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:09.079
And there's another giant
towards the top that's like kind

f7efa426-03cc-4ff8-8af8-8aa9e4d487e2-1
00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:13.329
of hovering over trees and
raising his fists. Some are

f7efa426-03cc-4ff8-8af8-8aa9e4d487e2-2
00:54:13.329 --> 00:54:17.580
pulling something from from the
ground, it looks like.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.851
One is
kind of climbing up a hill

f3acad44-3c8a-47c8-b01e-12a1000abe01-1
00:54:25.851 --> 00:54:30.117
towards the castle and one giant
in the middle has a belt and he

f3acad44-3c8a-47c8-b01e-12a1000abe01-2
00:54:30.117 --> 00:54:34.056
has three of the people in his
