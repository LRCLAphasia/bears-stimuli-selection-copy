00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.243
OK, I'm going to share my
screen in one second with the

dff97ad0-4d35-4b2c-91a1-4d5c1c172234-1
00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:09.730
directions for.

e1012019-d802-4091-9f91-3e7c35391102-0
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.250
What we will be doing.

615193c3-3a29-453b-b90f-cda11f977757-0
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.032
OK, so we're starting out with
a graphic novel. I'm going to

615193c3-3a29-453b-b90f-cda11f977757-1
00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:20.850
share my screen.

f3806c2a-7397-4ab0-9904-021c205d41b4-0
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.910
So.

4cca4d67-0c88-4a4f-86b8-f921a6efbde8-0
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.384
You are about to look at a
series of pictures that tell a

4cca4d67-0c88-4a4f-86b8-f921a6efbde8-1
00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:30.339
story. Imagine you are telling
the story to someone who cannot

4cca4d67-0c88-4a4f-86b8-f921a6efbde8-2
00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.470
see the pictures.

f7c9144d-2e03-43fe-9a58-6ee45c99aa1b-0
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.772
Describe what you see and what
is happening as you go through

f7c9144d-2e03-43fe-9a58-6ee45c99aa1b-1
00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:36.330
the story.

624fc0d0-6758-4b0c-b8aa-b48282c37201-0
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.230
And this story?

c93f82bb-9839-469a-b3e5-f2774afc8261-0
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.680
Let me see how long this story
is about 6 slides long.

e4bdb9f9-0aa6-4aa9-a4e3-898ccf12d8ca-0
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.123
And it typically takes between
like 10 like take between 10 to

e4bdb9f9-0aa6-4aa9-a4e3-898ccf12d8ca-1
00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:54.254
15 minutes to tell the story,
but that kind of depends on how

e4bdb9f9-0aa6-4aa9-a4e3-898ccf12d8ca-2
00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.720
long the story is so.

afecbed1-4175-4ff1-ba28-af55af066ffa-0
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.050
Well, I'll let you know how
it's going.

b29c23b7-0cbd-449c-9d79-c50e2036b29e-0
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.599
And I will also keep a
stopwatch, so if at any point

b29c23b7-0cbd-449c-9d79-c50e2036b29e-1
00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:07.429
you want to like a check in on
how long it's been or like if

b29c23b7-0cbd-449c-9d79-c50e2036b29e-2
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:11.195
you should speed it up or slow
it down, I'll have that. And

b29c23b7-0cbd-449c-9d79-c50e2036b29e-3
00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:15.025
since it's a story, whenever
you're done with one slide, you

b29c23b7-0cbd-449c-9d79-c50e2036b29e-4
00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:17.849
could tell me to move on to the
next slide.

e1bac184-a67d-4c26-9c0a-6cb21ad2a631-0
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.440
And I will share this.

d309d4f3-7ea3-42e2-aa5c-a0be0605da43-0
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.000
Slideshow OK.

ebb6be14-4baf-4685-adbd-1c5a915deb66-0
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.890
So I should start.

ef0c8838-49e0-4d65-82e0-7e2023f57b9c-0
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.690
Yes.

c61b7892-5707-47c8-ab6a-846918d6c6f3-0
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.670
#START_arrival_6 All right,
there is an empty pot sitting.

02f865cc-5e94-44cc-8e56-f90de2996c6a-0
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.842
On a table or outside a window.
And then there is I think is a

02f865cc-5e94-44cc-8e56-f90de2996c6a-1
00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.890
bird, and the bird comes and
lands.

a5ae65cc-2907-49e7-bf56-bddafb2b9b9d-0
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.080
Next to the pot.

7837e139-b1e6-400b-b68c-df0f82e18e79-0
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.056
lands on the pot and he's
looking in it. I think it's a

7837e139-b1e6-400b-b68c-df0f82e18e79-1
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:02.410
bird.

3f3bfc9d-55d9-41f9-bdd2-964900a42c8f-0
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.220
{Dude does.}

8626a476-12de-4e77-901f-eba0cd6de94d-0
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.430
{Yeah.}

3ce2c11b-ee62-4afb-9e93-b9089424208b-0
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.730
{Is the story progress?}

26d373b1-5a0c-418f-a6b6-319b85c669a8-0
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.920
{Um, yeah. It goes like, like,
yeah, up and down.}

8bf8d7e9-d87f-4a5a-8412-5ccc79b438cf-0
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.458
{And page OK yeah, it's weird
reading it. Graphic novels and

8bf8d7e9-d87f-4a5a-8412-5ccc79b438cf-1
00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.320
flat page.}

e9e8bca2-68b3-4e24-a3da-4df75a1488ae-0
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.365
Then it looks like the bird has
gone into the pot and there is a

e9e8bca2-68b3-4e24-a3da-4df75a1488ae-1
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:34.126
man sitting inside, writing with
a fountain pen. He's writing a

e9e8bca2-68b3-4e24-a3da-4df75a1488ae-2
00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:35.540
letter and he then.

7de8c65d-dbd6-49c6-b5cf-983ce4a9f210-0
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.479
Has is folding the letter into
the shape of a bird, and he is

7de8c65d-dbd6-49c6-b5cf-983ce4a9f210-1
00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:46.691
putting the letter inside of an
envelope along with some money.

7de8c65d-dbd6-49c6-b5cf-983ce4a9f210-2
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:51.578
He licks the envelope closed and
puts the stamp on. Then he

7de8c65d-dbd6-49c6-b5cf-983ce4a9f210-3
00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:53.940
leaves the place where he is.

eaf6d25e-05ef-428a-a6de-76dc9739c613-0
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.490
With a

e931a389-57a3-41ef-9e16-4cccc85985dc-0
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.080
Small animal companion.

4a4b4a44-77d1-4de1-a5c6-119673b81471-0
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.980
And he speaks with a woman on
the street.

31a5e623-72f0-42d8-9b58-9ebc7ac2055f-0
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.460
As if he is getting directions.

c00f1402-df15-493a-9824-7bf768e9ce83-0
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.490
Then he goes to.

68ac7ea7-2b3d-4be5-aed7-6da8a0ee61e6-0
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.040
A postal like box reads the
directions on the box.

35bd8ee1-22ac-45e8-82b7-61d1c53e125c-0
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.170
And sends his letter.

6122ffff-b0ae-4992-b4ff-083dd56ab33d-0
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.880
He seems to need a key to open
the box.

a5e7313d-569e-49b1-b196-41c733fb39cf-0
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.770
He looks up.

a954cfd9-bfc3-43c5-ba47-c1fb9830f74a-0
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.599
In a contemplative fashion, and
he walks away from the box with

a954cfd9-bfc3-43c5-ba47-c1fb9830f74a-1
00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.040
his animal companion.

bb6a478c-7405-4c17-bff2-7bf842747cf3-0
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.080
There is a leaf

27cd20ea-2492-432f-9a7c-7bae6385e54a-0
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.030
Standing.

e835487a-8714-4b56-b880-0b22e233af37-0
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.240
Up in the snow.

85e4db91-6656-49c8-8691-7a667fe16da2-0
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.520
It then begins to rain.

b435f101-de1a-42fe-a7f9-d54f087155ee-0
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.070
The leaf splits.

79037a34-bc74-48c1-a2b0-1204d6204d2a-0
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.040
And a.

76800793-206c-4e7e-8c9e-cc2ff948fd57-0
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.210
Stem emerges from the middle of
the leaf.

df84c841-5495-4cd5-9ed6-a43d699688e2-0
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.430
It slowly unfurls and becomes
what looks like a dandelion.

897e9366-57bc-44e5-abf0-37bc291cbd42-0
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.440
The leaves fall off, the flower
gets bigger and brighter.

f9dbd198-9c62-49f3-bea9-53a7ffacc0e0-0
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.860
The pieces start to blow away.

25339275-46b0-403f-8e3f-6d8de2103740-0
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.310
Than they are.

ea8cdad9-a3d7-4e04-920e-be98564798c0-0
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.530
Mostly gone, leaving in the
center of the flower.

4984b4be-3a2f-4ae9-8805-3ced614546db-0
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.960
The flower.

c597b05c-6414-42ef-a527-5cdcd45773fe-0
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.220
Stands alone darkly.

8e717305-077b-409d-ac23-e1d4bf88ebb7-0
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.780
Then birds come and fly to it.

912c7e58-a32e-4c96-899a-2e56c41de1dc-0
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.681
There seem to be fruit growing
from the center and the birds

912c7e58-a32e-4c96-899a-2e56c41de1dc-1
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.820
eat the fruit.

db2ba05d-7ebf-4d7b-b45b-08b7cad557d2-0
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.230
The plant is all alone and dark.

9e3540ea-21ef-4b6e-ad8f-90344b794896-0
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.810
Gets darker and then begins to
age and pieces fall off.

7b0808c5-486d-46fb-ac77-33b9d34f58c2-0
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.870
It becomes skeletal like.

e0b0af4c-b176-4c40-b9b3-330b3318aef3-0
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.060
It seems to snow again. And
then.

5254983b-8273-4d68-acf5-f3cfb0dcba21-0
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.596
The plant is submerged in the
snow partially and there are

5254983b-8273-4d68-acf5-f3cfb0dcba21-1
00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:05.310
footprints in the snow.

61f7533f-4841-4d6b-b35e-885bfdd5af33-0
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.790
There is a.

06c15704-29ee-402b-b3fc-3e7d42ec8b6c-0
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.560
This picture of a large
futuristic.

347a333a-88a1-4b0a-81d5-1a1635a31bb8-0
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.280
City there are.

38d45cc6-2f25-496f-804f-27716ce55bd6-0
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.890
Flying boat mobiles.

770f6fde-220d-4489-bdf9-3441aeae4ff0-0
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.620
There are pointy buildings and
round buildings.

a0180075-25bf-43ee-bb79-066f897632ee-0
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.770
There is a park on top of a
building.

e824e5af-0082-40ed-84c1-160fc0b53ca1-0
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.330
There are dragon like birds
flying around.

e21d199f-8570-44d6-ad41-e6375671d3c7-0
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.640
It seems to be winter and
there's snow on the ground.

c532b783-4fa0-4ec1-afa8-917d96727512-0
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.330
Steam coming out of the
chimneys.

647b4a40-0eb4-4332-8d44-81e3aede2e5c-0
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.040
And there are people walking
about.

51d76036-31ab-43a4-aeaf-d43521d32680-0
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.560
And.

7fffafe5-dbdb-4279-90e0-9d2bca7a836b-0
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.077
Then there's another view of a
futuristic city with a big

7fffafe5-dbdb-4279-90e0-9d2bca7a836b-1
00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:05.370
pointy building.

a5288ef5-adac-4438-b879-d41afb9fff73-0
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.280
And.

ddc8f8e6-49a5-4644-b71d-cfded8284630-0
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.100
Spires and smokestacks.

cdea132a-fbc9-49ec-8d27-7784728ee877-0
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.890
And.

555a3018-405e-4c00-882c-6d65b25a3279-0
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.710
Snowy fields. Some sort of
figures in the fields.

26ee5638-b746-44fe-9bad-36d0e94ed6fb-0
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.210
And more flying.

ace16323-66f1-4642-ae71-fdf27f086711-0
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.424
Boat transportation, vehicles in
the background and smoke lots of

ace16323-66f1-4642-ae71-fdf27f086711-1
00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:34.660
smokestacks.

517948bc-f8a5-4f5c-b567-7089c1b79162-0
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.550

00:11:21.307 --> 00:11:25.066

e7d1a0b8-9a3f-4318-8627-be3d4f6510e2-0
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.830
Same thing as before.

987bd3c1-13b0-44e9-bab3-d77db8d64171-0
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.850
Just describing the scene.

a74151d9-847e-47fb-b7f3-ecd6b69b2991-0
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:06.655
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
This is a scene of a movie

a74151d9-847e-47fb-b7f3-ecd6b69b2991-1
00:22:06.655 --> 00:22:10.900
that's being shot in on an
inside inside of a movie lot.

6a2e31e8-6d64-407b-b5aa-fde789f23ad7-0
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:18.077
There looks like it's actually
two different movies being shot

6a2e31e8-6d64-407b-b5aa-fde789f23ad7-1
00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:21.887
in the same place. One is an
outer space movie with aliens

6a2e31e8-6d64-407b-b5aa-fde789f23ad7-2
00:22:21.887 --> 00:22:23.760
and astronauts, and one is a.

c4b38188-3264-49aa-a26e-e2d4b8670fb4-0
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.510
Movie with dinosaurs and
Cavemen.

feff77fa-25e6-4467-9785-9cc8d4f78616-0
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.130
The dinosaurs are.

d316ec3a-7e1a-47c7-bb72-ad09aa49e078-0
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.555
All about mid size and different
colors and looks like that they

d316ec3a-7e1a-47c7-bb72-ad09aa49e078-1
00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:40.164
are being played by actors.
They're inside of them and there

d316ec3a-7e1a-47c7-bb72-ad09aa49e078-2
00:22:40.164 --> 00:22:41.880
are lots and lots of Cavemen.

300300e7-a347-41fb-a7e8-05e69dbac1b0-0
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.535
And the Cavemen are teasing the
dinosaurs and playing games with

300300e7-a347-41fb-a7e8-05e69dbac1b0-1
00:22:46.535 --> 00:22:48.900
the dinosaurs and climbing on
the dinosaurs.

cc51ea7d-9707-4394-b052-77e14ce2f7f8-0
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.084
There is a volcano up in the
corner and some of the Cavemen

cc51ea7d-9707-4394-b052-77e14ce2f7f8-1
00:22:55.084 --> 00:22:57.670
are trying to climb up into the
volcano.

87bdf11d-b2e6-4685-bf89-e7868fa41aaf-0
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.168
On the other stage there are
lots of aliens in flying saucers

87bdf11d-b2e6-4685-bf89-e7868fa41aaf-1
00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:09.315
which are being suspended on
rope by ropes, and there is a

87bdf11d-b2e6-4685-bf89-e7868fa41aaf-2
00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:14.898
spaceship that has landed upside
down. The scene is seems to be

87bdf11d-b2e6-4685-bf89-e7868fa41aaf-3
00:23:14.898 --> 00:23:16.120
like the moon.

ff8f67c1-9686-4b5d-9898-66766d8217cb-0
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:22.016
Or a barren planet where all
these spaceships are. One of the

ff8f67c1-9686-4b5d-9898-66766d8217cb-1
00:23:22.016 --> 00:23:24.420
spaceships is actually a ship.

79da2546-61e2-4983-8b10-937d2a202206-0
00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.680
Like a boat.

721823d7-7779-4a85-b513-c1fc1ef67ae7-0
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.640
The aliens are green with red
eyes.

0becde9b-3d05-4fee-bcd4-087c1f529b7d-0
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.517
Some of them have two arms, some
of them have one set of arms, so

0becde9b-3d05-4fee-bcd4-087c1f529b7d-1
00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:38.670
some of them have two sets of
arms.

2eefb6d3-77e7-4602-bd56-7292dd84f5b4-0
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.370
Umm.

47673529-2f89-407b-9004-8eb93abdcd46-0
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.756
The astronauts are wearing
orange suits with yellow gloves

47673529-2f89-407b-9004-8eb93abdcd46-1
00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.420
and that matches their
spaceship.

f8095a1c-102a-4dff-a03b-39acafbf3bf5-0
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.300
And they are all.

fe0e73a5-d2ce-4bfc-ab24-bd98a48aca5a-0
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.283
Some of them are running around
on the ground and some of them

fe0e73a5-d2ce-4bfc-ab24-bd98a48aca5a-1
00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:53.240
suspended by ropes.

a6fac780-0f0f-43f0-9cc5-c4400cc444c2-0
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.170
Uh, there are.

576889ed-8384-4ae9-89da-46ca9ac3a9ee-0
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.315
There's a camera crew that is
filming the astronauts, but it

576889ed-8384-4ae9-89da-46ca9ac3a9ee-1
00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:04.420
doesn't seem like anyone is
filming the other movie right

576889ed-8384-4ae9-89da-46ca9ac3a9ee-2
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.920
now. There's lots of lights.

e5ca1d9b-c907-49b6-b3d5-c5cd9be921d0-0
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.310
Then behind the two stages there
are.

7910c6f0-d144-426b-8399-ca5fcba21fd9-0
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.328
Smaller stages set up for
smaller scenes and possibly

7910c6f0-d144-426b-8399-ca5fcba21fd9-1
00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:22.160
different movies. 1 scene seems
to be a diner scene where the

9181ceaa-764f-43a3-ada5-43fe48c1a015-0
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.240
The diner is pink.

e4d5eece-b95c-44f3-86f4-98e91afd145f-0
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.148
Where this actually could be the
cafeteria for the movie. For the

e4d5eece-b95c-44f3-86f4-98e91afd145f-1
00:24:30.148 --> 00:24:33.480
movie lot, there seems to be
lots of different actors.

c7cd5686-71e6-4c78-b65f-951886469d9e-0
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.200
From both movies inside, so
that's probably what that is.

c7cd5686-71e6-4c78-b65f-951886469d9e-1
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.878
And then in the middle there's a
small scene that looks like it's

c7cd5686-71e6-4c78-b65f-951886469d9e-2
00:24:42.878 --> 00:24:43.019
a.

b541156b-5155-4812-a2e5-3ebe944bcfbc-0
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.950
Monster movie maybe?

f0f99462-ce98-40d5-8c35-2e01a3f38f44-0
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.687
And there are it's night and
there are lightning bolts

f0f99462-ce98-40d5-8c35-2e01a3f38f44-1
00:24:52.687 --> 00:24:56.030
painted on this the boards
behind the scenes.

96af80d8-fc0a-4798-90b2-d77e1829997c-0
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:02.022
There's a giant ice cream cone
in the middle. There are ghosts

96af80d8-fc0a-4798-90b2-d77e1829997c-1
00:25:02.022 --> 00:25:05.090
and mummies and monsters and a
werewolf.

69829985-57d3-4520-b6a5-97214a52fd9b-0
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.580
And they are being filmed by
multiple camera crews.

7c13c1eb-4584-45e0-b96f-e230c9856369-0
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.432
Then on the far left, there is a
small dressing room area that's

7c13c1eb-4584-45e0-b96f-e230c9856369-1
00:25:15.432 --> 00:25:19.198
very crowded and it has actors
and actresses getting dressed

7c13c1eb-4584-45e0-b96f-e230c9856369-2
00:25:19.198 --> 00:25:22.655
and changing and putting on
their makeup and getting on

7c13c1eb-4584-45e0-b96f-e230c9856369-3
00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:23.520
their outfits.

4ffe6c60-5dd8-4d04-93b6-03dfd025c20b-0
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.680
Umm.

304b3bb2-fd5d-47b1-a3b2-c580c5cd4c83-0
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.826
Most of the actors don't seem to
be taking their job very

304b3bb2-fd5d-47b1-a3b2-c580c5cd4c83-1
00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:36.070
seriously. They're all.

5d5bf406-7576-46e6-aef4-bdb70d7d1f76-0
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.510
Messing around and getting in
fights and falling over.

109044c8-4d75-4375-909c-28293f4769fc-0
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:44.910
There.

75d8b19c-7617-4536-a858-d7383636d46c-0
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.510
Doesn't seem to be anyone in
charge.

b0ab1d99-4529-4a04-bd71-1820825cfc2c-0
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:52.580
Umm.

caf2c342-78ef-49d3-9fa8-517d283a94d2-0
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.599
But lots and lots and lots of

caf2c342-78ef-49d3-9fa8-517d283a94d2-1
00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:56.150
people in the scene. #END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls

156ddc96-5dc2-4661-ad67-74fc9602887d-0
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.840
Perfect. OK, I'll see. Let's
see what we have next.

fe114e8a-0aa6-4381-8cbc-2f61a3e35ac8-0
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.520
OK, another complex scene is
next.

5414b227-402b-476e-bbdd-b853d3eebff8-0
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.090


195e2164-9e7f-4173-a342-9f71c62b6508-0
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.610
OK and I will put this in.

564d52b2-f3ba-482f-936d-56da15de65bb-0
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.480
OK.

fe89f5f6-4d5d-405b-8a5b-6d8f407431fc-0
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.784
And same thing as before, just
describe the scene and what you

fe89f5f6-4d5d-405b-8a5b-6d8f407431fc-1
00:26:35.784 --> 00:26:37.540
see in three to five minutes.

c6ab3f2a-eea5-4386-8e11-220cb000035e-0
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:40.580
#START_by_the_lake In this
scene.

147a2b1d-6377-4ab8-b0f8-98b3c4b3761b-0
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.890
There is a lake.

b4ddb7d6-8b41-4d07-8254-28f467ec5c0d-0
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.530
And there is a beach on the side
of the lake.

4de395f8-e232-4484-ac62-6f82b2a081bf-0
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.500
There.

465ab407-a237-4ee8-8a4f-f7dedc2e7f2f-0
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.737
Are lots of sandy areas. There
are rocky areas. There are many,

465ab407-a237-4ee8-8a4f-f7dedc2e7f2f-1
00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:57.635
many people on the beach. It's
very crowded. There's a

465ab407-a237-4ee8-8a4f-f7dedc2e7f2f-2
00:26:57.635 --> 00:27:01.747
volleyball game. There are
people flying kites, there are

465ab407-a237-4ee8-8a4f-f7dedc2e7f2f-3
00:27:01.747 --> 00:27:05.363
people playing soccer and
building sandcastles and

465ab407-a237-4ee8-8a4f-f7dedc2e7f2f-4
00:27:05.363 --> 00:27:06.710
listening to music.

664701a1-d76c-478e-b81f-46e9b992cf17-0
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.120
There are people sitting under
umbrellas.

364192ef-b6e5-49a1-b3f4-c6f81f42c26d-0
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.773
Then there are lots of people in
the water in the lake. There's a

364192ef-b6e5-49a1-b3f4-c6f81f42c26d-1
00:27:17.773 --> 00:27:21.547
float that people have swum out
to, and the float is very

364192ef-b6e5-49a1-b3f4-c6f81f42c26d-2
00:27:21.547 --> 00:27:25.450
crowded. There are kayakers and
people laying on inflatable

364192ef-b6e5-49a1-b3f4-c6f81f42c26d-3
00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:29.288
rafts. There are people in
tubes. There are people playing

364192ef-b6e5-49a1-b3f4-c6f81f42c26d-4
00:27:29.288 --> 00:27:30.719
with inflatable balls.

4d6d74fe-82e5-4152-bb3a-7c78df8258a0-0
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.920
There is a dock and a couple of
people are fishing off the dock.

4509b27d-92ad-485c-ac19-1b69ac7c18c1-0
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:41.097
There are lots of boats farther
off in the distance. There are

4509b27d-92ad-485c-ac19-1b69ac7c18c1-1
00:27:41.097 --> 00:27:43.420
sailboats, they're motorboats.

c702862f-a884-475f-926a-d6c92081c31d-0
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:44.840
There's.

5711198e-9cb5-47d6-b8b5-0914fa10cf04-0
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.950
What seems to be

63686c20-9c5a-474d-a25f-c9900c3900fe-0
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.142
A large dragon boat with many
rowers. They're paddle boarders

63686c20-9c5a-474d-a25f-c9900c3900fe-1
00:27:54.142 --> 00:27:55.030
there are.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.390
Paddle boats. Windsurfers.

90fa1fa4-884d-4a84-933e-6eb81ed02bae-0
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.785
There is a person riding a boat,
riding like a a tricycle with

90fa1fa4-884d-4a84-933e-6eb81ed02bae-1
00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:08.010
inflatable wheels.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.180

#START_being_a_pirate This is a
picture of what looks like a

71191643-6161-41b4-9355-f93f951a9e26-1
00:35:54.089 --> 00:35:56.250
battle between different pirate
ships.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.560
And they are off of the coast of
a beach.

f1975744-48d7-4557-8c78-4b353af319c6-0
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.531
There are lots and lots of
smaller boats in the water that

f1975744-48d7-4557-8c78-4b353af319c6-1
00:36:05.531 --> 00:36:06.600

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:12.356
There are people pirates on the
beach. It looks like some of the

a9fa4d3b-566b-48dc-b052-c39d99650313-1
00:36:12.356 --> 00:36:16.550
people in the scene are actually
maybe from some kind of Navy.

f44b6726-7829-4c11-bd30-6e4f6c206f1c-0
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.193
It looks like two of the larger
ships are pirate ships, and the

f44b6726-7829-4c11-bd30-6e4f6c206f1c-1
00:36:22.193 --> 00:36:26.256

00:36:30.122 --> 00:36:33.923
wearing all different colored
clothing. Some of them have

f44b6726-7829-4c11-bd30-6e4f6c206f1c-4
00:36:33.923 --> 00:36:38.051

some of them have swords.

All the little boats are.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.740
Going around the bigger boats
and attacking each other.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.349
Cannons on it and they are
shooting at the smaller boats.

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:02.036
One of the smaller boats has a
cannon on it and a shooting at

00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:02.810
at the shore.

One of the smaller boats has a
cannon on the front and has

eda1c78a-c5c6-4316-ba6a-c4aaa8cc622d-1
00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:15.560

in the crows nest area.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.600
And looks like they've
splintered one of the masts.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.540
Umm.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.899
The sea looks relatively calm.
There aren't any. There's a

ea4c51c9-688f-482d-bef9-12107586aabc-1
00:37:27.899 --> 00:37:29.420
couple of smaller waves.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.540
It doesn't look that rough.

1bb2fb0a-6789-4846-be9b-610138e03dd7-0
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:34.920
On the beach.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.787
There are some of the naval
officers, but also there are

1620d0d5-dcfa-459b-b197-bb8948478f4e-1
00:37:39.787 --> 00:37:43.459
some pirates who seem to be
trying to bury treasure. There

1620d0d5-dcfa-459b-b197-bb8948478f4e-2
00:37:43.459 --> 00:37:45.140
are a couple of palm trees.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.610
In the very center in between
the boats there is what looks

8dca8378-4fb8-4058-a600-50e0fa4a6e97-1
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.626
like a sea monster or giant
octopus, and it has gotten

8dca8378-4fb8-4058-a600-50e0fa4a6e97-2
00:37:58.626 --> 00:38:03.080
several of the pirates and is
waving them around in the air.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.301
There are some sharks in the
water that are waiting for

b1b5eb28-188f-4c86-9bfd-ba5415f3b1fd-1
00:38:07.301 --> 00:38:08.700
people to fall off the boats.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.860
The naval boat seems to be the
largest boat of the three.

4fcfae8a-dea9-402b-b6d2-19275da59dce-0
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.114
People are climbing on the boat,
people have fallen off and are

4fcfae8a-dea9-402b-b6d2-19275da59dce-1
00:38:26.114 --> 00:38:27.780
trying to climb back up the
sides.

7327bf7d-80f1-43e4-8f12-9b986f7fee4c-0
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:32.545
People have climbed all the way
up to the top of the masts and

7327bf7d-80f1-43e4-8f12-9b986f7fee4c-1
00:38:32.545 --> 00:38:33.850
are fighting up there.

15593c37-cca1-45b6-9afc-012bdf8e7e39-0
00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.300
Some of the rope ladders to the
masks have been cut.

d2618610-a921-4df0-8ddc-72d2f496bca4-0
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.550
Lots of them have people
climbing up and down them.

954e14a6-69a6-4782-9175-8a3f4b95458b-0
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.810
Most of the people in the
picture seem to be men.

73ad8dee-aafe-4d4d-b65b-2050227b2aa0-0
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.705
There are some women on one boat
that looks like the pirates are

73ad8dee-aafe-4d4d-b65b-2050227b2aa0-1
00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:56.865
chasing that boat and trying to
get the women off the boat, but

73ad8dee-aafe-4d4d-b65b-2050227b2aa0-2
00:38:56.865 --> 00:39:00.570
some of the women have jumped
into the water or swimming

73ad8dee-aafe-4d4d-b65b-2050227b2aa0-3
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:00.960
shore.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.482
A lot of the pirates are wearing
black shirts. What's going

cad6390e-611a-4b19-97b6-090e539c2894-1
00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:15.275
crossbones on them, and a lot of
smaller boats have flags with

cad6390e-611a-4b19-97b6-090e539c2894-2
00:39:15.275 --> 00:39:16.540
skull and crossbones.

Umm.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.180
They don't look like they're
very organized.

9990bd17-992d-4408-ab44-9a7ada68a0b4-0
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.380
One of the boats has sunk. It
looks like it's broken in half.

ec73bb43-c374-4115-96fa-a5c2841f443c-0
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.280
And the naval officers are
trying to swim to another boat.

dfb1d8fa-cd71-4d5d-bece-ca68510323c9-0
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.286
The naval officers all have long
guns, or a lot of them have long

dfb1d8fa-cd71-4d5d-bece-ca68510323c9-1
00:39:47.286 --> 00:39:49.810
guns where most of the pirates
have swords.

6cb57aa9-aaef-436f-a674-8e581588ae6d-0
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.770
The naval boat doesn't seem to
be identified with any

6cb57aa9-aaef-436f-a674-8e581588ae6d-1
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.759
particular country, it just has
long blue and white striped

6cb57aa9-aaef-436f-a674-8e581588ae6d-2
00:40:02.759 --> 00:40:05.020
flags up on the top of the
masts.

96de3ab9-48b6-46d1-8aaa-9cbc9e6b5db7-0
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.940
The naval boat has a figurehead.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.890
At the very front of the ship.

46efd1e5-321b-4a8c-97f4-aec5d2c55d8c-0
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.170
That is.

edc5190f-238e-4b66-a490-a5a29fc7ca30-0
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.070
A gold woman, maybe a mermaid.

f93f02cb-8d23-4f89-93b0-54d5743e38ca-0
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:37.058
Some of the pirates have big
hats on, and they look like they

f93f02cb-8d23-4f89-93b0-54d5743e38ca-1
00:40:37.058 --> 00:40:39.960
might be in charge of the other
pirates.

47c5c02c-203d-4558-b312-6b75e604d1ab-0
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.930
they seem to be directing the smaller boats. #END_being_a_pirate 

dedb0e1f-f2be-457c-8eb7-e4c5403c4557-0
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.910
OK, perfect.

151c5a09-188b-45e0-a356-68d3b7442a04-0
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.640
What's?

1f5304f3-6991-431f-bff8-1c92819ecc75-0
00:40:55.510 --> 00:41:02.072
OK. Now do you do you want to
take a 3 minute break or would

1f5304f3-6991-431f-bff8-1c92819ecc75-1
00:41:02.072 --> 00:41:08.000
you like to keep going? I'm OK.
OK. So next we have a.

d4dd466d-ae9d-43ab-8fd0-9a25d8704755-0
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.500
Short story.

61ee2018-6f62-46a7-863d-62856d83fa3a-0
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.950
OK, so this story is.

0c05e86e-4d3f-41df-965f-f2ba6e75120e-0
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.061
11 slides. So like we were
saying before, like it, it'll

0c05e86e-4d3f-41df-965f-f2ba6e75120e-1
00:41:36.061 --> 00:41:40.381
take 10 to 15 minutes to tell
the story. Whenever you're done

0c05e86e-4d3f-41df-965f-f2ba6e75120e-2
00:41:40.381 --> 00:41:44.771
with one slide, just tell me to
move on and I'll click through

0c05e86e-4d3f-41df-965f-f2ba6e75120e-3
00:41:44.771 --> 00:41:45.050
it.

d0390ce2-ad71-4bda-88bf-92a468fb2d4b-0
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.690
And let me just go to.

aa20d0a1-f1d6-4d98-a437-6d4f11924d6e-0
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.310
#START_flowerman It is night
time.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.520
It is a.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.860
Very barren landscape. There's a
town.

12c09f6a-bb70-421c-ba3f-adcae4c08ed7-0
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.400
On one side of what seems to be
a dried up riverbed.

cdf0b9b3-c676-4cea-bb5c-f2ccb7b4d122-0
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.001
And it looks like there's a
little bit of water left at the

cdf0b9b3-c676-4cea-bb5c-f2ccb7b4d122-1
00:42:15.001 --> 00:42:18.394
very bottom, but this was a Deep
River and there are some things

cdf0b9b3-c676-4cea-bb5c-f2ccb7b4d122-2
00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:21.630
down at the bottom that have
fallen into the river. There's a

d7dbc30f-56a7-4083-b518-1ff2e8e0e890-0
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:27.527
Old Rusty abandoned car. There's
a boat that sunk. There's an

d7dbc30f-56a7-4083-b518-1ff2e8e0e890-1
00:42:27.527 --> 00:42:28.040
anchor.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.910
The town looks very desolate.

306f446a-bcda-4944-9328-f25e952956e3-0
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:39.462
There, going over the river is a
bridge. Looks like it's a stone

306f446a-bcda-4944-9328-f25e952956e3-1
00:42:39.462 --> 00:42:41.860
bridge, and there is what

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.560
Looks like an elderly woman.

ec75dfeb-9d86-42ff-9d79-62f394d1e2c7-0
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:50.100
Crossing the bridge by herself
with maybe a small dog.

1cc79c4d-3fdf-43db-9ff5-d53ca3ae86fb-0
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:54.895
She's wearing a green coat and a
Black Hat with a red flower on

1cc79c4d-3fdf-43db-9ff5-d53ca3ae86fb-1
00:42:54.895 --> 00:42:58.678
it. There are four lamps, 2 on
either side of the bridge, and

1cc79c4d-3fdf-43db-9ff5-d53ca3ae86fb-2
00:42:58.678 --> 00:43:01.180
those that's the only light in

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.320
There's something else that I I
can't read the sign.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.200
All the buildings seem to be two
or three stories tall.

d65d6e2d-659b-4ba9-8c81-f1ddfd897b13-0
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:37.741
There are a couple people that
are walking around, but it's

d65d6e2d-659b-4ba9-8c81-f1ddfd897b13-1
00:43:37.741 --> 00:43:39.530
mostly abandoned, quiet.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.590
Some of the buildings have smoke
coming out of the smokestacks

aac19f89-7ccf-45b8-9d3b-33f5a66869bd-1
00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:45.630
and it looks like.

f2c4b23d-d6ec-417e-9d90-7858257f1230-0
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.938
There are people home and then
at the far left of the town

f2c4b23d-d6ec-417e-9d90-7858257f1230-1
00:43:50.938 --> 00:43:53.610
there's what looks like a
carnival.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:55.830
Which seems out of place.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:16.152
There are a couple of Street
lights, but other than that

0959663e-6e55-4edc-a024-2dfb6fc4214f-1
00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:18.480
everything is very dark and
Gray.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.313
There, the street looks like it
It's stone or cobblestones, and

27a2e830-95b1-4251-b6cb-09adb1ba08ed-1
00:44:25.313 --> 00:44:27.610
the sidewalks are larger stones.

And two people are standing in a
doorway to the person's right,

ac925cf1-027e-4d47-b713-870b7057eaad-1
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:42.213
which the person's left and it
looks like they are discussing

ac925cf1-027e-4d47-b713-870b7057eaad-2
00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:44.970

their town?

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.932
There is a car that is coming
out of one side street and it

c3269000-3b75-4c8d-9be2-292c903d72ad-1
00:44:49.932 --> 00:44:53.444
has its headlights pointed
directly at the person the man

c3269000-3b75-4c8d-9be2-292c903d72ad-2

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.370
There's also in part of the
picture there is a small balcony

176945a8-2d4d-47fb-8ae7-2abdc2b22e75-1
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.415
off the top of one of the
buildings and there's a boy

176945a8-2d4d-47fb-8ae7-2abdc2b22e75-2
00:45:07.415 --> 00:45:10.630
standing looking over the
balcony and he looks very sad.

4a4285fd-dd8f-4abc-ab98-59033faf7dd8-0
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.780
The person has walked farther
into the town.

e39e7d40-cc19-4b17-bbee-f699ca7b1a63-0
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.574
They're standing in a street
light. It looks like it actually

e39e7d40-cc19-4b17-bbee-f699ca7b1a63-1
00:45:25.574 --> 00:45:28.130
might be an older man. Looks
like they might have a beard.

f9de64b3-63c0-4f48-9601-0a23d6e2b683-0
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.317
And they're standing in front of
a house that is smaller compared

f9de64b3-63c0-4f48-9601-0a23d6e2b683-1
00:45:33.317 --> 00:45:37.329
to all the other houses in town.
It's two-story it looks like a

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.154
The curtains are all torn up and
it looks like the windows are

ab1c45db-52b6-48b6-9503-d3cde6db5090-1
00:45:42.154 --> 00:45:45.409
broken and it's been abandoned,
and there's a sign in front that

ab1c45db-52b6-48b6-9503-d3cde6db5090-2

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:51.880
You can see that there are
actually lots of people inside

525280bb-e1b9-4802-ad7f-11275468a828-1
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.232
the other buildings doing many
things. Some of the people are

525280bb-e1b9-4802-ad7f-11275468a828-2
00:45:56.232 --> 00:46:00.303
looking out at the man, but most
of them are entertaining

525280bb-e1b9-4802-ad7f-11275468a828-3
00:46:00.303 --> 00:46:02.760

It is now daytime.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.977
And it looks like the man has
been working on the House. The

00290bd3-8c39-4811-b44d-d8e94eb5c530-1
00:46:18.977 --> 00:46:20.510

fabdbe0d-87e8-49ee-a3a6-11ac23de8cdd-0
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.110
He's painted the shutters. He's
painted, he's put on a new roof.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.670
And behind the house there is a
tree that is flowering.

0e84807e-7c13-4751-bc77-962f7dc729cc-0
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.803
There are lots and lots of
people now out of their houses,

0e84807e-7c13-4751-bc77-962f7dc729cc-1
00:46:41.803 --> 00:46:45.220
going around the town, doing
different things, going

0e84807e-7c13-4751-bc77-962f7dc729cc-2
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.959
different places, talking to
each other, playing, but the

0e84807e-7c13-4751-bc77-962f7dc729cc-3
00:46:48.959 --> 00:46:51.860
rest of the town remains dark
and grayscale.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.991
It looks like more time is
elapsed because the man has

d439ad0a-db13-4362-b22e-e76c91887bdf-1
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:09.530

And fixed up the chimney.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:19.064
He is standing or kneeling at
the edge of his walkway and

3a749e31-d7f9-402c-b541-5f877d039bfc-1
00:47:19.064 --> 00:47:23.740
picking some flowers and waving
at someone who's going by on a

3a749e31-d7f9-402c-b541-5f877d039bfc-2
00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.780

c4dfd3e3-ece7-485f-a224-dbfb7ea4798e-0
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.166
But the person on the motor
scooter has turned and is

c4dfd3e3-ece7-485f-a224-dbfb7ea4798e-1
00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:33.907
watching a girl with red hair
who is walking away from the man

c4dfd3e3-ece7-485f-a224-dbfb7ea4798e-2
00:47:33.907 --> 00:47:37.470
and she's carrying a flower,
which he probably gave to her.

fb7f7b32-4383-4540-a4fd-0ce6a0f830b7-0
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.894
The girl is wearing a yellow
shirt and a blue skirt, and

fb7f7b32-4383-4540-a4fd-0ce6a0f830b7-1
00:47:42.894 --> 00:47:46.799
besides, the man in his house is
the only other part of the town

fb7f7b32-4383-4540-a4fd-0ce6a0f830b7-2
00:47:46.799 --> 00:47:47.460
with color.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:02.469
The man has gotten up and is
talking to another young girl

18dd53cb-1250-47cf-9361-065752c9a5f0-1
00:48:02.469 --> 00:48:07.870
with red hair, but her hair is
more orange and she has glasses.

77ec64c5-63e4-4089-a559-864097f843e9-0
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.520
And he has put one arm around
her.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.085
And looks like he has been
giving out flowers to other

15ba7732-8daf-4624-9a7d-fb436b125b4c-1
00:48:16.085 --> 00:48:17.320
people in the town.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:22.179
And the people in the town that
have flowers are very colorful

dc762580-a3c8-4f72-9449-57bb8cff2c36-1
00:48:22.179 --> 00:48:22.900

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:28.014
And it looks like as they take
their flowers and they go home

10388834-788d-41c2-aa94-85ee70e016e6-1
00:48:28.014 --> 00:48:31.550
and they go around the town
there and return, brightening up

10388834-788d-41c2-aa94-85ee70e016e6-2
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.290
the areas that they return to.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.278
The town has gotten even more
colorful, so in fact there is

4b0be5ed-a444-4e49-9944-64848dcef745-1
00:48:46.278 --> 00:48:48.550
very little grayscale left.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.821
The people are still milling
about and doing things, but they

00:48:53.821 --> 00:48:55.290
look happier than before.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:01.791
The man is having a cookout on
his lawn and he is throwing a

00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:07.080

Something to give him.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.820
The town seems to have.

Looking at the stars.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:04.499
But you can see that the man has
packed his bag again and he is

a292fe39-a82c-4fe1-9040-a03dc2215b31-1
00:50:04.499 --> 00:50:09.200
leaving his house and he is
headed what seems to be out of

is.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:29.120
Not like the night of before.
There are lots of lights on.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.929
There are a few people outside,

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:45.409
And the people who are pictured
in their windows seem to be very

05549334-c9fe-46a9-b4c8-e3dffda7077d-1
00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:45.710

It's triangular diamond shaped

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.056
You can see people in the
windows and they are looking out

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.797
The man is walking out of the scene and

9116ed66-b815-41b9-8805-d58f8a5575d4-0
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:48.830
They stand for a while and then
more people join them.

12dd8ba7-99f7-46fc-ba0c-a9a61aaf9859-0
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:55.980
The large ship that is up above
them comes in and.

1c4126ac-c1d7-4fe9-affa-1269d9910127-0
01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.348
Goes down so that the deck is
level with the platform that

1c4126ac-c1d7-4fe9-affa-1269d9910127-1
01:04:00.348 --> 01:04:03.350
people are standing on and they
board the ship.

a6e3ad94-8f04-4492-92c9-2a78b45b59e4-0
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:09.939
The man's ticket is punched and
the conductor directs him to get

a6e3ad94-8f04-4492-92c9-2a78b45b59e4-1
01:04:09.939 --> 01:04:10.950
onto the ship.

d5c75899-01c2-4e40-84b0-abe19848a0dc-0
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:14.630
{Next page.}

93823331-a637-49dd-b2a7-bc4c4f038fa5-0
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.632
The man and the animal find a
seat up on the deck. They sit

93823331-a637-49dd-b2a7-bc4c4f038fa5-1
01:04:21.632 --> 01:04:24.090
next to the woman who helped
them.

73febbd7-53f3-4718-9300-dda27aaea99a-0
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:27.030
The two of them have a
conversation.

bc28f377-7b16-4bb1-ac99-7486a1f5205d-0
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.607
The man pulls a piece of paper
out of his pocket and asks the

bc28f377-7b16-4bb1-ac99-7486a1f5205d-1
01:04:31.607 --> 01:04:32.790
woman to look at it.

5cac6aba-8ba6-4f53-bb81-5ce3dc72aa74-0
01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:35.680
The woman

b4875a95-0127-4d91-ac69-e3fb9a9597da-0
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:41.239
Then pulls another piece of
paper out of her purse, her bag,

b4875a95-0127-4d91-ac69-e3fb9a9597da-1
01:04:41.239 --> 01:04:42.780
and shows it it is a

e909f79a-e3c3-4d58-ad57-cc988de31a10-0
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:44.130
Picture.

dfa0f2aa-c42a-4e54-ad6e-ba95224d8293-0
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.547
Is as a page with some writing
on it and a stamp and the left

dfa0f2aa-c42a-4e54-ad6e-ba95224d8293-1
01:04:49.547 --> 01:04:54.174
side there is a picture of a
young girl with a short haircut,

dfa0f2aa-c42a-4e54-ad6e-ba95224d8293-2
01:04:54.174 --> 01:04:55.070
looking sad.

8e8c1e28-6d98-454e-a5ee-1ef4c3ad1a8d-0
01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.210
The girl from the picture is
then

a9e09ebf-68b5-4523-9261-5e1a37467e69-0
01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.138
She looks in a book and someone
takes the book away from her and

a9e09ebf-68b5-4523-9261-5e1a37467e69-1
01:05:05.138 --> 01:05:06.270
puts it in a drawer.

5beb81f4-e1d5-4f60-b252-990ed041a5dc-0
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.905
They then lock the drawer and
hand her a shovel and send her

5beb81f4-e1d5-4f60-b252-990ed041a5dc-1
01:05:10.905 --> 01:05:11.970
off with a shovel.

23dd6658-e278-416d-a415-a598db4d7b23-0
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.100
She shovels

cc146bca-a1b5-4901-970e-24fd847c8dbb-0
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.160
Something into

7022cbc8-cca1-44c5-80dc-c99eb27e04d0-0
01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:24.141
A hole in a small building that
appears to have fire inside of

7022cbc8-cca1-44c5-80dc-c99eb27e04d0-1
01:05:24.141 --> 01:05:24.380
it.

122c7403-b460-4612-a620-860bc2cf1723-0
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.115
She keeps shoveling things into
it. Looks like there is maybe

122c7403-b460-4612-a620-860bc2cf1723-1
01:05:31.115 --> 01:05:32.450
snow on the ground.

10e03ad8-df61-40ee-b17a-f0592663109d-0
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:38.081
And the burning continues. A lot
of smoke comes out of the hole

10e03ad8-df61-40ee-b17a-f0592663109d-1
01:05:38.081 --> 01:05:42.820
and she has to get a ladder and
climb up on top and clean out

10e03ad8-df61-40ee-b17a-f0592663109d-2
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.960
the chimney of the building.

a7114f68-6a16-4074-aff2-3ffdd223fc95-0
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:53.980
It now appears that she is in a
place with lots of these

cb9d63b0-27df-4fbf-9d8f-6b4ce6d7bf84-0
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:55.780
Little

35173593-976c-4169-969b-e11371ec89dd-0
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.257
Ground stoves with smokestacks
coming out of the top and they

35173593-976c-4169-969b-e11371ec89dd-1
01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:03.650
are all separated.

3d136566-9e78-430b-bb0f-c1a550777ac1-0
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:09.975
By walls. And there is a person
in every little compartment with

3d136566-9e78-430b-bb0f-c1a550777ac1-1
01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:14.050
their own stove shoveling things
into the stove.

4441f2c4-9888-4970-9086-757fefb0c69e-0
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.117
She is standing up on the top of
her smokestack and she is

4441f2c4-9888-4970-9086-757fefb0c69e-1
01:06:19.117 --> 01:06:22.750
cleaning it out while she looks
over at all the other.

2d6092bc-8072-4792-a58a-b97b2e0fb886-0
01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:27.240
Uh, people in all their
compartments shoveling.

53d77a76-441e-4a64-bf54-6ccd729a4808-0
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:35.092
She is sitting on the ground,
cross legged, looking very sad,

53d77a76-441e-4a64-bf54-6ccd729a4808-1
01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:40.863
stands up and takes her shovel
and pries the door open. She

53d77a76-441e-4a64-bf54-6ccd729a4808-2
01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.210
looks out and.

2ded9145-8632-4739-b97a-9ce43ce1a40f-0
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.527
Can see no one is coming and she
pulls a key out of a pocket of a

2ded9145-8632-4739-b97a-9ce43ce1a40f-1
01:06:47.527 --> 01:06:51.601
coat hanging on the wall. She
then takes the key and unlocks

2ded9145-8632-4739-b97a-9ce43ce1a40f-2
01:06:51.601 --> 01:06:55.941
the drawer where the person had
put her book. She grabs the book

2ded9145-8632-4739-b97a-9ce43ce1a40f-3
01:06:55.941 --> 01:06:56.810
and runs off.

ae8523f8-703a-4c9e-b189-5b2a582d81c2-0
01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.050
She is running across

90360b13-e774-4964-80a4-040dc3ef21fd-0
01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.940
An open space.

251badb3-141d-47a9-8c09-950441556b83-0
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:08.778
In this area with lots of large
buildings and trains, she climbs

251badb3-141d-47a9-8c09-950441556b83-1
01:07:08.778 --> 01:07:10.040
onto the train

fd924bf9-5ac8-4ece-b42e-ce8d1003ab77-0
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:17.509
Into a large cargo car and she
sits with her book. The train

fd924bf9-5ac8-4ece-b42e-ce8d1003ab77-1
01:07:17.509 --> 01:07:18.580
then leaves.

7f13c579-07df-4e95-8242-c3402b27aaf9-0
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:32.762
We are now back on the boat with
the the man and the woman who

7f13c579-07df-4e95-8242-c3402b27aaf9-1
01:07:32.762 --> 01:07:34.730
are flying through the air.

3fc6b84b-38a9-44f8-aadf-bb26d228d851-0
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:40.447
It is journeying through a city
with lots of billboards in an

3fc6b84b-38a9-44f8-aadf-bb26d228d851-1
01:07:40.447 --> 01:07:41.750
unfamiliar language.

fbd63831-7d54-430e-af92-5d26ab18be6e-0
01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:46.416
The woman is pointing things out
to the man as they go along, and

fbd63831-7d54-430e-af92-5d26ab18be6e-1
01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:48.410
the conductor makes an
announcement.

626722bd-e18d-4a5f-83f5-7fba2ee4ad39-0
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:54.004
The boat docks again and the man
gets off, but the woman remains

626722bd-e18d-4a5f-83f5-7fba2ee4ad39-1
01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:54.810
on the boat.

25e19e6d-0adf-4389-95c3-5bb477b21fd0-0
01:07:56.230 --> 01:08:01.408
The man looks about and looks
confused. He is now in another

25e19e6d-0adf-4389-95c3-5bb477b21fd0-1
01:08:01.408 --> 01:08:06.670
large city, but it's different
than the one before. There are

25e19e6d-0adf-4389-95c3-5bb477b21fd0-2
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.350
lots of.

cf3958b3-c9e4-4490-a976-fc1abaeca836-0
01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:14.020
Roads upon platforms and all
different shaped buildings.

dede7bb3-4993-42fb-941a-93039511ba04-0
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.200
There are lots of roads divided
by walls.

69ec9611-7763-4532-a018-babbfc68f799-0
01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:24.270
And in the center of the town is
a very, very large statue.

55fe0ad6-a9c7-4177-98ad-68715679321d-0
01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:31.460
And it has. It's depicting an
animal that is holding a bowl.

f62a80ca-b36b-4366-bf35-53a0fc11dfd1-0
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:37.080
{No, it's page.}

8f0e99a3-8e23-49b0-a745-6957ec058af3-0
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:44.571
The man walks along with his
animal companion. They are going

8f0e99a3-8e23-49b0-a745-6957ec058af3-1
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:45.740
along a street.

1c719f69-d415-4dfe-b736-4e2680455050-0
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.490
There

82277e08-4f82-4855-a1a5-90f36026b054-0
01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:54.074
Are some people that seem to be
bartering over large curly

82277e08-4f82-4855-a1a5-90f36026b054-1
01:08:54.074 --> 01:08:54.890
vegetables

c57463d2-53b2-4763-82e9-beda66b4795a-0
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.420
There is a woman.

80332d21-3a87-49f6-bc08-a09544674bce-0
01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:01.770
It was buying something from a
sort of.

036d04da-c48a-479b-a614-cabb51ad42f2-0
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.970
Vending machine with full doors
that open.

c5de7806-e1cf-4784-ac6e-c7edc3a3c8a8-0
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:11.066
A man in a beret is looking at
an animal that is being offered

c5de7806-e1cf-4784-ac6e-c7edc3a3c8a8-1
01:09:11.066 --> 01:09:12.220
him by a woman.

0d3e288c-dc2b-436f-8f8e-8b05714ffe34-0
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.980
The man consults a book.

f2f52845-1b20-48d7-96c8-8d3b9fa65e10-0
01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:20.870
And looks at different pictures
of food.

cf5daf95-a40f-4b4b-9ca1-35641dd755ab-0
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:26.550
He seems to be looking for a
translation. Perhaps and

f9061d33-ee91-43e3-9b90-5396842fa806-0
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.442
The his animal companion pulled
his attention to the vending

f9061d33-ee91-43e3-9b90-5396842fa806-1
01:09:31.442 --> 01:09:34.130
machine that the woman got
something out of.

14a26612-680d-401e-9990-e530f233c110-0
01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:39.450
He opens a little drawer in the
machine and finds vegetables. He

14a26612-680d-401e-9990-e530f233c110-1
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:40.730
consults his book.

6b1dbbe3-c7d1-4ccc-ba45-9421ed4882ac-0
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.690
And he pulls one out.

4d5bc5a7-406f-4969-96a6-f25787a14ca9-0
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:48.700
He is then approached by the boy
from earlier.

7d22a2d6-efe3-4e9e-8e9a-d7236e7500f0-0
01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.420
Who takes the vegetable from him

6149da05-d9d6-4053-86ba-6d30259f1852-0
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.274
That man with the suspenders the
glasses, joins them and waves

6149da05-d9d6-4053-86ba-6d30259f1852-1
01:09:57.274 --> 01:09:59.150
and offers him the vegetable.

5e0e3fe7-0c5b-49c8-bc8f-6bd5a49fb28a-0
01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:03.013
The man does not want the
vegetable and he shows them a

5e0e3fe7-0c5b-49c8-bc8f-6bd5a49fb28a-1
01:10:03.013 --> 01:10:05.230
picture in his book of a loaf of
bread.

d468b315-e244-4860-b837-59855e30699f-0
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.930
The man with the glasses then
shows him another compartment.

5b9e4177-4197-48a9-8d0d-49162ac88dc7-0
01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:17.480

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:27.735
And the boy offers him a bowl,
which the man takes. The man

a8ac1b18-3441-468b-9c92-d0831ba0f552-1
01:10:27.735 --> 01:10:31.810

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:56.990
Like fruits with roots, the man
eats a piece of something.

0d21bef3-dae1-494a-b365-48928c9dc2f8-0

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:25.546
And another one looks like a
type of cucumber with segments

dd36cadd-4c71-4456-9ea1-b4861e27b1e0-1
01:11:25.546 --> 01:11:26.090

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.314
And the man takes a bite of the
cucumber like one. The boy then

63895f34-1bec-4d65-a55f-73c75df740de-1
01:11:35.314 --> 01:11:38.752

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:47.720
The boy whispers a question to
the man with the glasses, and

ddde00e0-b261-47f4-ba50-0726569ae233-1
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.386
the man with the glasses puts
his arm around the traveler and

01:11:52.386 --> 01:11:57.051

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.730
The boy approaches one of the
boats and

The man looks in and is very
surprised by a large tentacle

5dad1fb4-f54f-4ec1-b1f3-fe9b640013d1-1
01:12:16.409 --> 01:12:20.281

by the other man who encourages

01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:21.370

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:27.409
And the boy pulls another small
animal out of the pot that has a

4c47ea84-d665-4d2d-9e8f-4eda0c44e97f-1
01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:31.681

d75a7b73-197d-4bec-917b-534cdabcacb5-0
01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:54.962
The man had dropped his
vegetables when he was surprised

d75a7b73-197d-4bec-917b-534cdabcacb5-1
01:12:54.962 --> 01:12:57.810

seems apologetic.

The traveler then takes his book
and draws a picture of some

01:13:09.534 --> 01:13:14.039

the people are sneaking out

track of how many lions have

ignoring these groups of people

stepping into another loop.

Up you can see that the stream
joins a river that goes through

98ed71ff-47ba-45b7-904c-1fdd8790cf62-1
01:30:24.389 --> 01:30:28.668

of him, he is motioning at the

2d22f9d5-88f9-4153-b3cb-588f6fdc95dd-1
01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:02.795

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.684
And it looks as if he is
refusing to sit down or to do

31239ec3-a4fc-4360-adb6-4c69ad81fd90-1
01:31:25.684 --> 01:31:29.859
something. The king and the
other Prince look very confused,

31239ec3-a4fc-4360-adb6-4c69ad81fd90-2

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:51.013
This figure seems to be leading
a group of soldiers to attack

478a98bc-45a2-40cb-810b-46039e12ccdf-1
01:31:51.013 --> 01:31:56.311

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.690

I'm going to share and then.}

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.586
One of the two boys at the top
of the stairs takes out a purple

60e0bc7d-25c8-4ca6-b0d6-4d8cda84c865-1
01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.470

Large winged animal.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.378
The group jumps up onto the
animal, which becomes real and

e7eb82b7-53e0-40da-a407-96ddc8f3453d-1
01:33:24.378 --> 01:33:26.590
flies off over the ocean.

01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:37.860
As they escape the.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:44.125
Original figure jumps back onto
his craft, which then unfurls

215334d8-18de-4021-9d34-74cbb8b46037-1
01:33:44.125 --> 01:33:49.601
large purple wings from the
sides and lifts off into the air

01:33:49.601 --> 01:33:54.897
after them. The the man takes
out his box again and shoots

purple streamers after him.
After the people on the

01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:14.660
It seems that the.

01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:20.524
Man with the box is able to
destroy the thing that the boy

01:34:20.524 --> 01:34:25.142
had drawn and they all fall off
of it. The king grabs the one

e7e21275-b221-427a-9e51-6359f9620727-2
01:34:25.142 --> 01:34:28.420

from falling.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.271
And the man and the other boy
fall down through the air. The

5271d147-e5c6-4b09-9e7d-fe14508139fb-1
01:34:33.271 --> 01:34:36.130

They fall all the way down into
the ocean.

01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:49.950
It is a a deep.

01:34:57.130 --> 01:35:02.011
Cliffs and turrets the boys
crown falls off. The boy pulls

f5931a7e-cfee-439b-ba4e-52180ec19aba-1
01:35:02.011 --> 01:35:04.990
out his red crayon again and
draws.

01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:09.320
A vessel.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.690
But the boy continues drawing
and completes a submarine.

964b0e5e-9b14-4371-9645-a125c185f746-0
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:20.190

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:25.886
Boy and the man are safe inside
the submarine and they begin to

63a8f777-73aa-4ff1-9221-59aa5f9f8ad1-1
01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:27.980
pilot it around under the water.

01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:37.720
They pull the submarine up.

01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:39.460
On to.

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:47.660
A shore next to a set of cliffs
with a cave.

0c9de775-f69a-444a-b948-40f027c6b3fd-0
01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:55.263
They can see that inside The
Cave someone has drawn pictures

0c9de775-f69a-444a-b948-40f027c6b3fd-1
01:35:55.263 --> 01:35:56.770
of people and.

01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:00.540
Flying things and.

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.330
A dragonfly and lots of
interesting shapes.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.784
The man and the boy stand on top
of the submarine and observe the

5e6eda99-165f-48d0-9f4a-ec87bd0b018c-1
01:36:10.784 --> 01:36:12.150
shapes on the walls.

01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:15.530
The purple bird circles over
them.

01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:28.336
It appears that the pictures on
the wall seem to be a

f98048d8-d608-477c-80ff-78355836053c-1
01:36:28.336 --> 01:36:31.340
representation of what just
happened to them.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.030
The boy points excitedly at the
wall and.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.440
The man looks at the pictures.

e58cec29-bf5a-4140-a5a8-8d9e179ee96e-0
01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:43.140
There is a small Gray door.

81e4d4e0-7049-4655-96a7-5ce37b3b27ef-0
01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.400
Shorter than the man and the boy
that is on the wall.

5b0acdb4-5a35-41f0-acb2-4b465a61697b-0
01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.370
The man.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.637
Continues to look at the
pictures, but the boy notices

32991bb1-0422-4738-b87d-0fd7b3516188-1
01:37:02.637 --> 01:37:07.078
that the menacing figures from
before have found them and have

32991bb1-0422-4738-b87d-0fd7b3516188-2
01:37:07.078 --> 01:37:10.180
docked their boat at the mouth
of The Cave.

1a315813-4ea6-4700-a1a5-14ddd8a277b7-0
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.150
The man.

06661f8e-d703-428b-a41d-b9999bb126d8-0
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:16.390
Takes out a black marker.

08d5d470-ce59-4bc1-b3d5-3491a17e6f06-0
01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:20.370
And seems to have an idea. He
then draws.

177db980-04bd-4b3e-90b7-5c361bbac623-0
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:24.450
Perch for the bird to sit on.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:37.551
The menacing figure from before
is very excited to see the bird

7a02b082-b150-4097-813d-0d4a2a5c99a9-1
01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:41.121
and runs up to the bird sitting
on the perch with his box,

7a02b082-b150-4097-813d-0d4a2a5c99a9-2
01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:43.420
trying to suck the bird into his
box.

01:37:45.190 --> 01:37:47.460
It is revealed that the.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.960
Perch platform that he the bird
is sitting on is actually a trap

8b517b55-3638-45a6-8b67-e191a68115a2-1
01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.425
and as the man sucks the bird
into his box, the gates come up

8b517b55-3638-45a6-8b67-e191a68115a2-2
01:37:58.425 --> 01:38:03.034
and capture the man. The man's
box is outside the cage. The boy

8b517b55-3638-45a6-8b67-e191a68115a2-3
01:38:03.034 --> 01:38:07.355
and the man run up to it and
grabbed the box. The man looks

8b517b55-3638-45a6-8b67-e191a68115a2-4
01:38:07.355 --> 01:38:11.100
like he is trying to smash the
box onto the ground.

3eec443a-6be8-4bb7-8dc8-a49a4c7518d2-0
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:18.940
As he smashes the box, it splits
open and.

01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:25.589
Many colors of light come out.
The bird escapes, the winged

01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:10.513
And the Gray door in the wall is
a jar. You can see the tail of
