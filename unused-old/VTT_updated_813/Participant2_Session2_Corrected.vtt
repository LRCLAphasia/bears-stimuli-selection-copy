6892d8d9-e2fe-4e88-b37c-397417f3f40e-0
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.769
OK, so you are about to look at
a series of pictures that tell a

6892d8d9-e2fe-4e88-b37c-397417f3f40e-1
00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.762
story. So imagine you are
telling the story to someone who

6892d8d9-e2fe-4e88-b37c-397417f3f40e-2
00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:14.552
cannot see the pictures.
Describe what you see and what

6892d8d9-e2fe-4e88-b37c-397417f3f40e-3
00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:18.410
is happening as you go through
the story and this story.

63d594ab-051a-4809-9fd6-2c18a88eac1e-0
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.847
Let's see. This story is about
20 slides long, so it'll take

63d594ab-051a-4809-9fd6-2c18a88eac1e-1
00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:28.668
you roughly 1010 to 15 minutes
to tell the story. So I'm going

63d594ab-051a-4809-9fd6-2c18a88eac1e-2
00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:33.260
to stop sharing that, and now
I'm going to share the story.

75da0b8a-9797-4250-a5fe-0e374370ed8a-0
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.140
And I'll make this bigger for
you.

506dd1cf-d1bb-42a5-aecd-4c83bdfc2320-0
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.241
OK. And like before, like
before, when you're writing,

506dd1cf-d1bb-42a5-aecd-4c83bdfc2320-1
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:48.550
move on. I could.

f2ddb1c3-727c-4bd2-8a05-5a5da6191df7-0
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.360
Flip the pages. OK and.

281545be-6702-4c18-8f48-8f014f484745-0
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.190
Yes.

27ef18f4-d683-468b-86ce-de173b705dff-0
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.640
And So what I did last time is
what you're looking for.

9146d015-2f2d-4281-baf0-8d554695061f-0
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.480
What you see and tell the story.
What I see and tell the story.

2f6c034a-8bd1-47aa-a99d-8709398f10da-0
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.420
OK. Ready. Yep.

685ebc73-f69b-4fbe-9bc5-4f626d6f4ccf-0
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.902
#START_return So we start off
with a man who's in an office in

685ebc73-f69b-4fbe-9bc5-4f626d6f4ccf-1
00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:23.790
his home and he's writing.

f5e750d4-9bcf-44ef-87b4-ff63e8e6fde6-0
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.530
With his left hand on a desk.

e81f9102-9b1f-4472-ba1e-f6d0d68ce7c6-0
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.142
There's a bright light above his
head, shining down onto what

e81f9102-9b1f-4472-ba1e-f6d0d68ce7c6-1
00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:35.400
he's writing, or maybe drawing
something.

0b5b80bc-d5bd-4510-9397-18b3dea92f81-0
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.994
In the room, there's a picture
on the wall with a picture

0b5b80bc-d5bd-4510-9397-18b3dea92f81-1
00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:45.479
frame. There's a bookshelf full
of books, and there's a real

0b5b80bc-d5bd-4510-9397-18b3dea92f81-2
00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.258
short, small wooden door that's
closed. And then there's a large

0b5b80bc-d5bd-4510-9397-18b3dea92f81-3
00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:54.449
door that's open, and coming in
that door is a red kite.

bba2c844-5d89-4279-ad89-a947c067419c-0
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.403
Now we're outside the room and
you can still still see the tail

bba2c844-5d89-4279-ad89-a947c067419c-1
00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:06.258
of the kite and the and the line
that leads to the kite, and

bba2c844-5d89-4279-ad89-a947c067419c-2
00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:11.431
that's in red. And there's a set
of stairs going down in a table

bba2c844-5d89-4279-ad89-a947c067419c-3
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:16.444
with the TV, then another table
with a plant and some pictures

bba2c844-5d89-4279-ad89-a947c067419c-4
00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:17.400
on the wall.

9af6b4d1-edef-40d1-abef-f291887af20c-0
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.951
Then there's also another room,
so we're clearly in a house

9af6b4d1-edef-40d1-abef-f291887af20c-1
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:28.404
upstairs. And there's a bedroom
and on the bed is a cat

9af6b4d1-edef-40d1-abef-f291887af20c-2
00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:29.120
sleeping.

6c82fae2-afe1-4dfc-a88b-db5c2024830b-0
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.516
There's a door between the
bedroom and a small bathroom.

6c82fae2-afe1-4dfc-a88b-db5c2024830b-1
00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:40.132
The bathroom has a sink and a
waste basket, and one light

6c82fae2-afe1-4dfc-a88b-db5c2024830b-2
00:02:40.132 --> 00:02:42.440
above the sink with a mirror.

8d361df9-6561-4bce-a516-b52c278b3e56-0
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.150
And a couple of pictures on the
wall.

f58604f4-3813-47a4-aeb8-210a45c63981-0
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.970
And then we've gone downstairs
and we're in the entryway.

1fcbf993-4e57-42fe-98f2-b2941f575d72-0
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.136
So there's the front door, and
there's a coat tree with some

1fcbf993-4e57-42fe-98f2-b2941f575d72-1
00:02:56.136 --> 00:03:00.728
coats and hat hanging on it, and
a small entryway table with a

1fcbf993-4e57-42fe-98f2-b2941f575d72-2
00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:01.530
lamp on it.

1667519a-2ccd-4c0e-952b-9ce0375631f5-0
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.244
There's a large vase on the
floor with some plants coming

1667519a-2ccd-4c0e-952b-9ce0375631f5-1
00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:08.090
out of it.

b0cd524f-6659-4d33-81b4-43329ab91ff1-0
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.270
And on the wall is wallpaper.

c9c8fe9c-5af4-4962-acd6-d1430a8527a3-0
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.660
And two picture frames.

14aac564-24aa-4478-94be-17906fa6b740-0
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.494
And there's an open doorway that
where you can see towards the

14aac564-24aa-4478-94be-17906fa6b740-1
00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:28.826
stairs that are curved to stair
rail with the stairs going

14aac564-24aa-4478-94be-17906fa6b740-2
00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:29.640
upstairs.

b408aeca-c135-436c-aaad-2f5f7fffbd27-0
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.620
And on the wall is wallpaper and
a mirror.

a3a90f19-4dbf-496a-b33f-efddca990caf-0
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.571
{Excuse me. You're good.} So now
we see the kitchen and there's a

a3a90f19-4dbf-496a-b33f-efddca990caf-1
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:46.443
stove with a pot on the stove, a
white stove with a with a hooded

a3a90f19-4dbf-496a-b33f-efddca990caf-2
00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:51.870
vent and some cabinets below and
cabinets above. Some of the

a3a90f19-4dbf-496a-b33f-efddca990caf-3
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.564
cabinets below open and others
are are drawers, and you can see

a3a90f19-4dbf-496a-b33f-efddca990caf-4
00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:03.080
that there's also a sink there.
And up above the cabinets are

a3a90f19-4dbf-496a-b33f-efddca990caf-5
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.970
different.

197b4c49-d122-4706-a11b-3e8e57558a62-0
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.900
Pieces of dishes or decorative
items.

0c0d3afb-31ab-498f-b8a5-067dedf86bdc-0
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.003
Now you can see also a set of
stairs, but I don't know where

0c0d3afb-31ab-498f-b8a5-067dedf86bdc-1
00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:17.763
that's leading with the stairs
go up and I don't know where

0c0d3afb-31ab-498f-b8a5-067dedf86bdc-2
00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:21.900
it's leading, but there's a door
at the bottom of the stairs that

0c0d3afb-31ab-498f-b8a5-067dedf86bdc-3
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.530
lead into another bedroom.

a9487e62-05c9-47cd-84f9-93ee79870474-0
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.610
This bedroom has a small bed.

f7c0896d-8bf1-4b9d-a125-16dc95dad67f-0
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.670
And above the bed.

11240b37-5457-4cc8-8a14-88cc8a65718b-0
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.130
Is a map of the world and a red
hot air balloon is hanging from

11240b37-5457-4cc8-8a14-88cc8a65718b-1
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.722
the ceiling as well as a blue, I
mean a purple bird hanging from

11240b37-5457-4cc8-8a14-88cc8a65718b-2
00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:48.940
the ceiling.

fdb599db-34ca-4004-b5b2-52a15c396813-0
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.517
And there's a window, and below
the window is a dresser. Dresser

fdb599db-34ca-4004-b5b2-52a15c396813-1
00:04:55.517 --> 00:05:00.434
with a lamp on on top of the
dresser and a wastebasket down

fdb599db-34ca-4004-b5b2-52a15c396813-2
00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:01.500
on the floor.

e774a727-4041-40d0-a3e2-0c49c280b685-0
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.990
And there's a girl who is
holding a red ball.

69e6c99b-7986-42c5-a164-2dbde960f90b-0
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.248
And she's got an orange crown on
her head. She has brown hair,

69e6c99b-7986-42c5-a164-2dbde960f90b-1
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:19.757
wearing a white shirt with Gray
shorts and brown shirt shoes.

69e6c99b-7986-42c5-a164-2dbde960f90b-2
00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:24.999
She has a red pen in her hand
and she's drawing a doorway.

3258c5b3-0d5c-484d-b397-3a2b414dffe4-0
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.640
OK.

e77da89c-faaa-42a4-8cfa-7e2613bd435c-0
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.497
So now we see not just one large
picture, but but three snippets

e77da89c-faaa-42a4-8cfa-7e2613bd435c-1
00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:42.072
of a picture. So in the top
picture is the man who was in

e77da89c-faaa-42a4-8cfa-7e2613bd435c-2
00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:42.940
his office.

a9ab5f9b-6748-400a-8466-54e181a37ffd-0
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.627
Sitting at his desk drawing, and
he stopped drawing and turned

a9ab5f9b-6748-400a-8466-54e181a37ffd-1
00:05:47.627 --> 00:05:51.600
around and looked at the red
kite that's laying on the floor.

a9ab5f9b-6748-400a-8466-54e181a37ffd-2
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.509
Now he's gotten up off of his
desk stool and he's picking up

a9ab5f9b-6748-400a-8466-54e181a37ffd-3
00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.880
the red red kite with his left
hand.

f5c6e134-25a5-46a8-b0ed-0eef4c53817e-0
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.487
And now you see the red kite
laying on the floor, and you see

f5c6e134-25a5-46a8-b0ed-0eef4c53817e-1
00:06:03.487 --> 00:06:07.500
his desk and his stool. But I
don't know where the man is.

be9b449c-11c9-450a-a25c-5d4bed89dfe8-0
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.858
So now in the bigger picture, he
is in the little girl's bedroom,

be9b449c-11c9-450a-a25c-5d4bed89dfe8-1
00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:19.085
the bedroom where she drew the
red door, and the man's leaning

be9b449c-11c9-450a-a25c-5d4bed89dfe8-2
00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:22.440
down, looking through the red
door that's opened.

872d8be5-f8e9-4925-b119-2c7d271a7095-0
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.740
OK.

792ccba5-05f3-481c-9aba-cce5f019857e-0
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.503
So now we're in a forest, and
the forest has a lot of really

792ccba5-05f3-481c-9aba-cce5f019857e-1
00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:40.423
big trees. In between the trees
is hanging a string of lights.

792ccba5-05f3-481c-9aba-cce5f019857e-2
00:06:40.423 --> 00:06:45.342
There are some small lights, and
then there's also some larger

792ccba5-05f3-481c-9aba-cce5f019857e-3
00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:49.949
lights that are like lanterns,
all hanging from the trees.

ab5da409-8c44-4347-ba52-e14f7d7db302-0
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.910
And.

615cdb89-e880-4a09-8f84-44cb6f6c1678-0
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.284
From one of the big trees is the
red door that the little girl

615cdb89-e880-4a09-8f84-44cb6f6c1678-1
00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.630
drew in when she was in her
bedroom.

0bd22cb8-f023-49d3-b368-56db0bd6f310-0
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.172
And the the man has walked
through that red door and is now

0bd22cb8-f023-49d3-b368-56db0bd6f310-1
00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:08.040
standing in the forest.

f745a7de-93d9-409a-a0c4-7dcb53d3b405-0
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.527
There's a a stream and across
the stream is a small pier or a

f745a7de-93d9-409a-a0c4-7dcb53d3b405-1
00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:22.811
small deck that's coming out,
wooden, wooden deck that's

f745a7de-93d9-409a-a0c4-7dcb53d3b405-2
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:28.373
coming out from the land into
the water, and on the edge of

f745a7de-93d9-409a-a0c4-7dcb53d3b405-3
00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:31.340
that deck or pier is a red ball.

0b871b77-6347-484d-bcb6-b5cd42f83669-0
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.482
Now the man has gone over to
that wooden pier and he's

0b871b77-6347-484d-bcb6-b5cd42f83669-1
00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:45.670
standing on the edge of it and
he's holding the red ball.

5d4fbb70-2b51-4310-b87f-e732b89de407-0
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.452
He still is amongst all the
trees, with all the lights that

5d4fbb70-2b51-4310-b87f-e732b89de407-1
00:07:50.452 --> 00:07:54.549
are strung between the trees and
the lanterns hanging from the

5d4fbb70-2b51-4310-b87f-e732b89de407-2
00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:54.940
trees.

7082ecf2-0156-48cd-94e1-58b870928364-0
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.923
And coming down the stream is a
is a boat that looks like a

7082ecf2-0156-48cd-94e1-58b870928364-1
00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:05.724
dragon. So you can see the
Dragon's head and part of his

7082ecf2-0156-48cd-94e1-58b870928364-2
00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:11.030
body on the front of the boat,
and on the back is a is a tail.

429a423e-d4fd-4c22-9c61-1fe6613fb155-0
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.916
In the next picture we see three
different images in the first

429a423e-d4fd-4c22-9c61-1fe6613fb155-1
00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:19.210
one.

2efdbff5-1369-4407-89d4-b94f732bbf2d-0
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.911
Again, the man is standing on
the deck holding the ball red

2efdbff5-1369-4407-89d4-b94f732bbf2d-1
00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:27.010
ball, and the dragon boat is
approaching him.

be1a1fa0-7bc9-4d73-a225-ead0945c8ec6-0
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.279
So now the Dragon boat is right
in front of him, and the man has

be1a1fa0-7bc9-4d73-a225-ead0945c8ec6-1
00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.970
jumped onto the dragon boat and
it's going past on the water.

0e230139-1851-4903-b6c7-3ca48e3f5d0f-0
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.659
So the man is riding on the
dragon boat and he has his hand

0e230139-1851-4903-b6c7-3ca48e3f5d0f-1
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:50.639
up above his eyes, looking
towards the front to what he can

0e230139-1851-4903-b6c7-3ca48e3f5d0f-2
00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:55.950
see. He's still holding the red
ball, and right in front of him

0e230139-1851-4903-b6c7-3ca48e3f5d0f-3
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.681
now is a large castle. The
castle has a lot of different

0e230139-1851-4903-b6c7-3ca48e3f5d0f-4
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:05.661
towers and tur...turrets on it,
and some of those have blue

0e230139-1851-4903-b6c7-3ca48e3f5d0f-5
00:09:05.661 --> 00:09:07.569
roofs and some of them.

0675ac9a-65e4-4f50-912e-b31d09b886e2-0
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.555
Are Dome shaped and are gold
with flags flying off the top of

0675ac9a-65e4-4f50-912e-b31d09b886e2-1
00:09:12.555 --> 00:09:17.630
them. So the boat is is in the
water and it's headed towards an

0675ac9a-65e4-4f50-912e-b31d09b886e2-2
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.960
A large open door headed into
the castle.

4abff674-501e-4180-8dec-1335de35a576-0
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.450
Now you'll see a larger picture
of the castle.

7d18ecb1-a643-4a79-a732-b1c555de5f88-0
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.415
And I don't see the man in the
dragon boat, but between the

7d18ecb1-a643-4a79-a732-b1c555de5f88-1
00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:37.263
left side castle and the right
side castle is a very tall

7d18ecb1-a643-4a79-a732-b1c555de5f88-2
00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:42.613
bridge going over the the water
or the Moat, and on top of that

7d18ecb1-a643-4a79-a732-b1c555de5f88-3
00:09:42.613 --> 00:09:44.870
bridge is a small red boat.

15438b6b-c569-4dc8-905c-771796a7674e-0
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.240
With a person in it.

2bac7901-5a97-42ae-82ad-dda1c9e3b588-0
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.702
Going from one side of the
castle to the other side of the

2bac7901-5a97-42ae-82ad-dda1c9e3b588-1
00:09:51.702 --> 00:09:52.030
castle.

e895c3e3-2ec2-42fd-a8e2-7be615f36d91-0
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:54.690
OK.

ed8a6d78-5c0c-408e-bedc-be7b04004a2e-0
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.104
So now we're back to the Dragon
boat, and we can see the the man

ed8a6d78-5c0c-408e-bedc-be7b04004a2e-1
00:10:01.104 --> 00:10:03.350
has arrived at the end of the
water.

48b84856-6cbd-44df-9e0a-da6aab44cdca-0
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.125
To a the bottom of a set of
stairs and he's jumped off the

48b84856-6cbd-44df-9e0a-da6aab44cdca-1
00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:13.691
boat. He left the red ball on
the boat and he jumped off the

48b84856-6cbd-44df-9e0a-da6aab44cdca-2
00:10:13.691 --> 00:10:17.957
boat and he's racing towards
some people and there's the

48b84856-6cbd-44df-9e0a-da6aab44cdca-3
00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:19.080
small girl who.

860316a3-4224-4324-82ab-9dfff550bb91-0
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.320
Is the one with the Red Pen who
was in her bedroom and drew the

860316a3-4224-4324-82ab-9dfff550bb91-1
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.782
red door, and she's running up
those steps towards another

860316a3-4224-4324-82ab-9dfff550bb91-2
00:10:30.782 --> 00:10:32.220
child and an adult.

754ba293-bd9a-46ea-9b89-59db6d90a2ed-0
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.670
Above the child and the adult.

0b943d18-ef3a-4714-9d79-926f095803c0-0
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.970
Is a purple bird flying just
above them along the.

dc941e25-a899-4658-8307-65e3caafb282-0
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.108
The the side of there watching
are two probably security

dc941e25-a899-4658-8307-65e3caafb282-1
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:56.560
guards. They're in uniform, they
have bugles in their hands.

76bbc7f8-7774-406a-8e1d-b7d51ea5caff-0
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.105
And on the other side of that
water, the same thing, there's a

76bbc7f8-7774-406a-8e1d-b7d51ea5caff-1
00:11:01.105 --> 00:11:02.560
group of people over there.

69491db2-a6d1-457c-9a92-2cfaf7ae3f07-0
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.700
Ohh.

bcb9f132-1225-4291-9793-8ddf187bd7b2-0
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.670
I can't tell what they're
wearing, really.

0f44f37d-af92-4ce8-abbc-c15a14e7f010-0
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.547
So now we see the man
approaching who looks like a

0f44f37d-af92-4ce8-abbc-c15a14e7f010-1
00:11:15.547 --> 00:11:17.310
Prince or a king.

2e7aaef0-fe5e-4cdf-8725-2aaccfe08b11-0
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:24.070
This king has a crown. He has a
long white beard. He is a long

2e7aaef0-fe5e-4cdf-8725-2aaccfe08b11-1
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.340
yellow cloak with a brown.

157bbf6c-c8ee-4850-bc9b-294dacefb6d4-0
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.780
Cloak over it.

6521df81-18fb-4232-8349-0c2be28b73a3-0
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.540
And some.

e91b2d2a-aacc-4bf4-94a2-f4c195640372-0
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.920
Decorative.

db657a6f-2a9c-4d44-856d-9b50462a6968-0
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.746
Like banner kind of across his
chest, across his chest, and

db657a6f-2a9c-4d44-856d-9b50462a6968-1
00:11:41.746 --> 00:11:47.353
standing by him is the young boy
who has a purple pen with him.

db657a6f-2a9c-4d44-856d-9b50462a6968-2
00:11:47.353 --> 00:11:52.260
The boy has a striped shirt and
blue pants and a crown.

bf526e56-3908-4bcf-b4b0-2e7d5ca6e0c0-0
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.160
And the purple bird.

cd24ea93-6269-4728-9e1c-260a73989428-0
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.260
Is now sitting on the shoulder
of the young boy.

38c6a421-dd03-4189-90f6-c28729531e99-0
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.860
They're looking towards the
young girl who is still holding

38c6a421-dd03-4189-90f6-c28729531e99-1
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.560
her red pen.

b90ee349-7801-4bae-bd34-9dc9ef4f7982-0
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.921
Wearing a crown and she has her
arms crossed and is looking the

b90ee349-7801-4bae-bd34-9dc9ef4f7982-1
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:13.199
other way, kind of trying to
ignore them and she's looking

b90ee349-7801-4bae-bd34-9dc9ef4f7982-2
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:13.780
towards.

8460f90a-fae6-4e3e-8206-3b5216bd8d11-0
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.430
Looks like the throne of a king.

d0a12d84-09d1-4fba-b744-dab756cd27ff-0
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.690
OK.

5566fc47-6980-4d77-91fc-63b318acb053-0
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.268
So now we see all four of them.
The King, the little boy, the

5566fc47-6980-4d77-91fc-63b318acb053-1
00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:34.673
little girl. The little boy
still has his purple pen. The

5566fc47-6980-4d77-91fc-63b318acb053-2
00:12:34.673 --> 00:12:38.849
girl has her red pen. And we see
the the the man also.

05b9ce22-df7b-41a3-90e9-2ad9bf24b892-0
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.450
They're looking out. Oh, and
above them is the purple bird.

861df10a-8c11-4e42-ae17-4beb61e0d456-0
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.939
They're looking out towards some
water where the dragon boat is,

861df10a-8c11-4e42-ae17-4beb61e0d456-1
00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:55.143
which would be right at the
bottom of those steps. Now

861df10a-8c11-4e42-ae17-4beb61e0d456-2
00:12:55.143 --> 00:12:59.807
they're at the top of those
steps, and on the Dragon boat is

861df10a-8c11-4e42-ae17-4beb61e0d456-3
00:12:59.807 --> 00:12:59.960
a.

e939fa1f-5a5a-46ef-8774-c0b6ca647801-0
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.630
Like a guard.

1a8c7882-9065-4c78-8ba3-e05fc6cbea3c-0
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.637
Who seems to be stepping off the
boat towards them and he's

1a8c7882-9065-4c78-8ba3-e05fc6cbea3c-1
00:13:06.637 --> 00:13:08.310
carrying something in his hand.

ad491d4d-c25b-47d9-9a5c-0c732ef3da05-0
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.357
Following that, that guard are
other guards coming off the the

ad491d4d-c25b-47d9-9a5c-0c732ef3da05-1
00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:22.043
Dragon boat and they have like
sword swords in their hands, and

ad491d4d-c25b-47d9-9a5c-0c732ef3da05-2
00:13:22.043 --> 00:13:27.107
the swords look like large
arrows. And they're headed up

ad491d4d-c25b-47d9-9a5c-0c732ef3da05-3
00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:32.349
the steps towards the the the
four, the king, the man, the

ad491d4d-c25b-47d9-9a5c-0c732ef3da05-4
00:13:32.349 --> 00:13:37.768
young boy, and the young girl.
And the king has something in

ad491d4d-c25b-47d9-9a5c-0c732ef3da05-5
00:13:37.768 --> 00:13:39.190
his hand that's.

a8e6de50-7eea-4c17-a5dd-cefc9a832bae-0
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.190
Looks like it's shining.

823e5fe7-5525-4b5d-a677-e35f186365b0-0
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.040
But I don't know if it's a
weapon or a light.

8e613497-07ff-4935-9af7-89e02a03b323-0
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.841
So now the guards who have come
off the dragon boat are getting

8e613497-07ff-4935-9af7-89e02a03b323-1
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:59.213
closer and they're headed up the
steps, but the king has come

8e613497-07ff-4935-9af7-89e02a03b323-2
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:00.410
down a few steps also.

5c7cdc90-d60a-47e9-b96b-bd24506a83c6-0
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.650
He.

93109fb0-3a08-4c90-9e7f-49a6d18f8a52-0
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.394
Still has something in his hand
that I'm unsure. I think it is

93109fb0-3a08-4c90-9e7f-49a6d18f8a52-1
00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:14.789
probably a sword of some sort
trying to hold back those. Those

93109fb0-3a08-4c90-9e7f-49a6d18f8a52-2
00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:20.013
guards and behind the king are
the the man, the boy, and the

93109fb0-3a08-4c90-9e7f-49a6d18f8a52-3
00:14:20.013 --> 00:14:23.610
girl, and the girl is holding
the purple.

d51107fd-202e-40ba-8180-401d2cd35378-0
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:24.830
Bird.

b5798e08-fdcd-430d-91cf-74af57bbff9e-0
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.782
So the king has now taken his
sword out and pointed it towards

b5798e08-fdcd-430d-91cf-74af57bbff9e-1
00:14:31.782 --> 00:14:36.518
the first guard who's coming up
the steps, and he has something

b5798e08-fdcd-430d-91cf-74af57bbff9e-2
00:14:36.518 --> 00:14:40.070
in his hand that has a crank on
the side of it.

0c3e2e54-6588-49f6-b744-379f2f852d53-0
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.700
Now he's taken that.

fdb91832-f377-409a-9383-d5e76b3af67d-0
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:51.028
Device with the crank and put it
aimed it at the king, and it has

fdb91832-f377-409a-9383-d5e76b3af67d-1
00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:55.360
managed to take the sword out of
the King's hand.

0a36ba9f-5bd3-4fa9-a1c4-76a4ef5d1023-0
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.351
So now they've captured the
king. One guard is holding on to

0a36ba9f-5bd3-4fa9-a1c4-76a4ef5d1023-1
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:04.784
his right hand, and the other
guard is is standing on his left

0a36ba9f-5bd3-4fa9-a1c4-76a4ef5d1023-2
00:15:04.784 --> 00:15:08.935
side, and the man with the
device that has the crank on it

0a36ba9f-5bd3-4fa9-a1c4-76a4ef5d1023-3
00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:11.750
is now running, running away
from them.

bea31358-4ae9-4375-a713-50b3bc13e661-0
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.760
So now we see the man with the
young boy and the young girl.

d5248d81-f91c-433f-855e-f883ea37a8fc-0
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.600
And the young boy with the
purple Pen is drawing.

60c9528e-9220-4e46-be5a-7dd3d62a1573-0
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.680
Is drawing. It looks like a
purple animal of some sort.

d9b41602-205b-4459-b9c1-57a8ad49e766-0
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.646
And the young girl is behind.
Behind them, she's holding her

d9b41602-205b-4459-b9c1-57a8ad49e766-1
00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:41.786
red pen along with the purple
bird, and approaching them from

d9b41602-205b-4459-b9c1-57a8ad49e766-2
00:15:41.786 --> 00:15:45.600
behind is the guard with the
cranking device.

e6bb4fe3-bc65-46d3-ba4a-c0fc87f4fe8d-0
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.740
So the boy has managed to draw.

d0ca48d5-79eb-42e6-9273-8f2d705020c9-0
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.440
Excuse me has managed to draw a
purple.

07b62f7d-849b-46ba-a578-495c4babdcee-0
00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:01.324
Animal that is very mystical
looking. It's kind of like a a

07b62f7d-849b-46ba-a578-495c4babdcee-1
00:16:01.324 --> 00:16:07.888
lion, but it has big wings and
the man along with the young boy

07b62f7d-849b-46ba-a578-495c4babdcee-2
00:16:07.888 --> 00:16:13.940
and the young girl have climbed
on the back of this purple

07b62f7d-849b-46ba-a578-495c4babdcee-3
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.530
winged animal and are flying
away.

345fdea3-f343-4db7-9b3c-1bec03a5c0f8-0
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.722
And they're up in the sky
already, and behind them is a

345fdea3-f343-4db7-9b3c-1bec03a5c0f8-1
00:16:22.722 --> 00:16:26.765
small tower with the guard who
has the crank device, and he's

345fdea3-f343-4db7-9b3c-1bec03a5c0f8-2
00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:28.200
reaching towards them.

49594156-10e0-4975-bf73-819d06d2a523-0
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.119
So the the man, the boy and the
girl are still on the the the

49594156-10e0-4975-bf73-819d06d2a523-1
00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:39.030
flying purple animal.

df56d5dd-c3fc-4c33-96ba-6bd97a5e9940-0
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.660
And the girl has her red pen and
the purple bird. But the boy has

df56d5dd-c3fc-4c33-96ba-6bd97a5e9940-1
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.740
now lost his purple pen. It's
flying off the back end and

df56d5dd-c3fc-4c33-96ba-6bd97a5e9940-2
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.280
trying to follow them is the.

abf645c5-6759-4145-923a-613dbb71d33d-0
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.786
Dragon boat that now appears to
be flying. It's out of the

abf645c5-6759-4145-923a-613dbb71d33d-1
00:16:58.786 --> 00:17:03.165
water. It has the king who's
been captured along with three

abf645c5-6759-4145-923a-613dbb71d33d-2
00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:06.450
guards, and they're flying above
the castle.

f184aee8-6c4b-43be-9cf5-2c960de0aefd-0
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.660
So the.

68d78060-7bd2-49e9-b7e1-f8f7ace63d50-0
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.180
Dragon boat that is now flying,
so now it's a dragon.

4fb1afd1-7c6c-4dc7-b96d-675c1f32d4db-0
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.720
plane.

a22bb810-b9f0-4bbf-90ba-ff80fc32dd3f-0
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.955
Still has the king with the with
the guards on it, and they have

a22bb810-b9f0-4bbf-90ba-ff80fc32dd3f-1
00:17:29.955 --> 00:17:34.456
captured the little boy. So
they're hanging on to the little

a22bb810-b9f0-4bbf-90ba-ff80fc32dd3f-2
00:17:34.456 --> 00:17:38.956
boy with one hand off the side
of the the dragon, and on the

a22bb810-b9f0-4bbf-90ba-ff80fc32dd3f-3
00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:43.604
front of the dragon is the guard
with the crank device, and it

a22bb810-b9f0-4bbf-90ba-ff80fc32dd3f-4
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:43.900
has.

c55ad7e1-af2e-41b1-b525-e9b1fc3a564b-0
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.360
Seems to have maybe.

835a27e7-dd55-4f4b-b9d1-fc58271aa589-0
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.020
Sucked in the flying purple.

36d7170e-6a81-4b5b-b0b0-ee56860da98b-0
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.510
Animal and there's feathers
flying all over so.

cf0c9e14-210a-48c9-a49b-23ef6428a4ec-0
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.834
Now the man is holding the hand
of the little girl, and they're

cf0c9e14-210a-48c9-a49b-23ef6428a4ec-1
00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:07.772
falling in the sky, and the girl
still has her red pen in one

cf0c9e14-210a-48c9-a49b-23ef6428a4ec-2
00:18:07.772 --> 00:18:11.520
hand and she's holding on to the
purple bird in the other.

a242709e-a834-45c4-876c-a8c489507c5a-0
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.308
So now the man and the little
girl have fallen from the sky

a242709e-a834-45c4-876c-a8c489507c5a-1
00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:25.582
and they've fallen down into the
water and under the water. It's

a242709e-a834-45c4-876c-a8c489507c5a-2
00:18:25.582 --> 00:18:30.450
very deep and there are a few
schools of fish and some rock

a242709e-a834-45c4-876c-a8c489507c5a-3
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:35.400
formations growing up from the
from the bottom of the water.

1518e219-92c5-4248-a3d0-1f33b9202aa4-0
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.513
And they're falling down into
the into the water. And as

1518e219-92c5-4248-a3d0-1f33b9202aa4-1
00:18:40.513 --> 00:18:45.203
they're falling, the little girl
has now taken her red pen and

1518e219-92c5-4248-a3d0-1f33b9202aa4-2
00:18:45.203 --> 00:18:45.650
she's.

5a2c9fdc-bd8e-47a7-8f3b-b440a3b3dd78-0
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.470
Drawing a boat.

85fd18b7-ec33-418f-84a1-57fa5f528ba0-0
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.309
So they're still in the water
and and what she has really

85fd18b7-ec33-418f-84a1-57fa5f528ba0-1
00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:01.960
drawn is not just a boat but a
submarine.

0ea8498c-1e6f-4665-b89f-c92a53c6d2b5-0
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.991
So now the submarine is under
the water with just the very top

0ea8498c-1e6f-4665-b89f-c92a53c6d2b5-1
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:10.981
showing and you can see inside
the submarine is the purple

0ea8498c-1e6f-4665-b89f-c92a53c6d2b5-2
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:11.320
bird.

c3fc3905-fd59-4fb3-b37b-221a7e624d2d-0
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:18.750
And you can see the man sitting
at a desk with a porthole.

ab8bd76d-980b-469c-9562-728f1884d695-0
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.730
And above the man.

95d8ab82-7e6a-4f43-9183-715f1ed013df-0
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.420
The little girl is.

d62a89a3-dd1e-4996-a3d1-622d2f821c32-0
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.860
Standing and looking through the
Periscope.

81393e76-5545-4efe-b804-6b2afe45a1ac-0
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.360
That's above the water, just to
see what's out there.

9cc73ad4-a5b4-44e3-ad73-f0a58a5437fc-0
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.501
So now the submarine has
surfaced and it's right by a

9cc73ad4-a5b4-44e3-ad73-f0a58a5437fc-1
00:19:44.501 --> 00:19:45.200
large cave.

153c4eaa-88fe-445d-bc29-86c3521a1225-0
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.631
And we still see the man and the
little girl standing on top of

153c4eaa-88fe-445d-bc29-86c3521a1225-1
00:19:52.631 --> 00:19:57.067
the submarine. The little girl
still has her red pen in her

153c4eaa-88fe-445d-bc29-86c3521a1225-2
00:19:57.067 --> 00:20:01.725
pocket, and above them is the
purple bird. And they're looking

153c4eaa-88fe-445d-bc29-86c3521a1225-3
00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:06.013
towards the The Cave. And above
The Cave are all sorts of

153c4eaa-88fe-445d-bc29-86c3521a1225-4
00:20:06.013 --> 00:20:09.340
drawings or hieroglyphs.
Drawings of people.

815e241f-0ed3-404e-8f69-92358189cb4c-0
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.020
And.

20931bd7-f485-437c-acce-29b690803db4-0
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.720
And.

bb1337b9-2510-4a70-8db0-d9c0b01e697d-0
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.110
Maybe some animals?

3b2d9639-06b1-4d5b-a885-51adb102fb8a-0
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.100
A boat.

f0dbd849-e5ff-4d94-bf1a-e5a88dfcf0d0-0
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.300
Hot air balloon.

7322b4a5-438b-40fa-81c5-9813c4571e47-0
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.293
And now you can still see the
opening to the large cave, with

7322b4a5-438b-40fa-81c5-9813c4571e47-1
00:20:25.293 --> 00:20:28.350
the water also going into The
Cave and the hieroglyphs.

34ac8712-ded9-4161-b132-d4a4b736aec1-0
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.372
So now they're starting to go
into The Cave and they're

34ac8712-ded9-4161-b132-d4a4b736aec1-1
00:20:37.372 --> 00:20:40.370
pointing to some of the drawings
up on the side of The Cave.

ad84d0b0-8d60-48b4-b2b5-3f7c2950802b-0
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.450
And one of the drawings looks to
be a a man.

2069363c-2604-4ef3-98ae-0806ff3b74a9-0
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.710
And a woman. The woman has a
bucket.

c4d0ad47-9351-45d1-adbe-e18dedebdb93-0
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.050
May be pouring something and
there's a bird.

382505e6-95ac-4913-a6ed-38c63e0abce3-0
00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.550
And there's also another person.

13f5876e-0a74-47f9-8780-1e3247fe23bc-0
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.530
Um standing under a bit of a
canopy.

5e907171-cbaf-45b6-831c-9797a2efadc4-0
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.840
And down at the bottom, where
the man and the little girl are

5e907171-cbaf-45b6-831c-9797a2efadc4-1
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.270
standing right on the edge of
the water, there's also a small

5e907171-cbaf-45b6-831c-9797a2efadc4-2
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.700
door that's leading into a rock
formation and sitting next to

5e907171-cbaf-45b6-831c-9797a2efadc4-3
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.630
the man and the girl is the
purple bird.

f7b7448b-7621-4f86-84bc-b8e09c4afbf7-0
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.537
So now you see the man and the
little girl and the purple

f7b7448b-7621-4f86-84bc-b8e09c4afbf7-1
00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:34.331
purple bird, and the man now has
a pen in his hand and he's

f7b7448b-7621-4f86-84bc-b8e09c4afbf7-2
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:35.470
drawing something.

fb2f3980-db63-4799-bcc0-8aa728b29731-0
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.686
And what he's drawn is actually
a bird cage that's hanging off

fb2f3980-db63-4799-bcc0-8aa728b29731-1
00:21:40.686 --> 00:21:43.810
of a stand, a stand that is
rectangular shape.

9a60091f-b947-4473-8c58-e85cd7546650-0
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.450
That looks like a door, and the
birdcage is hanging from it.

24e2d530-36fe-4303-a5bc-c7d13b618a83-0
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.055
So now you can see the man and
the little girl are crouched

24e2d530-36fe-4303-a5bc-c7d13b618a83-1
00:21:59.055 --> 00:22:00.320
down behind a rock formation.

238de330-9cea-4727-a3e0-eeaafdd0cd07-0
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.503
The little girl has her red pen
in her back pocket of her

238de330-9cea-4727-a3e0-eeaafdd0cd07-1
00:22:05.503 --> 00:22:10.189
shorts. They're peering around
the rock formation towards the

238de330-9cea-4727-a3e0-eeaafdd0cd07-2
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:10.870
birdcage.

b1aa347b-d0dd-40f4-920e-9afb1fc2105e-0
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.770
With the purple bird in it.

d69aa98f-47f0-4448-a1af-b0a6c50a81a9-0
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.523
And running towards the Purple
Bird is the man with the crank

d69aa98f-47f0-4448-a1af-b0a6c50a81a9-1
00:22:19.523 --> 00:22:20.020
device.

90489fd1-ec52-465a-81cf-e4fedebdf036-0
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.260
And now he has.

4645df9c-04c0-4b21-bc78-ed1cfcd75fd7-0
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.220
Entered the bird cage. The sides
of the cage had bars that were

4645df9c-04c0-4b21-bc78-ed1cfcd75fd7-1
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.390
on them that that are now down.

f01ca105-7fd0-4f8d-93ed-37dd4a3c1269-0
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.510
On all four sides, so the cage
is open.

a94457be-c475-4072-83b6-0c822683966b-0
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.600
And the man is approaching the
purple bird and.

6d41ca36-683b-498f-973f-ae13a7e5d48b-0
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:45.508
Looks like the bird has has been
sucked into that crank device,

6d41ca36-683b-498f-973f-ae13a7e5d48b-1
00:22:45.508 --> 00:22:50.139
but now the crank device has
fallen out of the guard's hands

6d41ca36-683b-498f-973f-ae13a7e5d48b-2
00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:54.997
and the guard is standing in the
open cage and the crank device

6d41ca36-683b-498f-973f-ae13a7e5d48b-3
00:22:54.997 --> 00:22:56.440
is falling outside.

05e00d12-bea2-435e-a9dd-86832aefbdb7-0
00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.340
The.

93fa9365-83be-4e47-8a3e-571aa303c41f-0
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.470
The man and the little girl.

b64010be-510b-4a5c-b613-92a6870f2dfd-0
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.050
Have managed to put up the sides
of the bird cage that are bars.

a22c4478-a074-41b5-b217-f9dc9fe55c0d-0
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.250
And they have now trapped the
guard.

61629a72-994f-45b1-9cb1-dc1be727a020-0
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.331
And they have the crank device
and they're throwing it at the

61629a72-994f-45b1-9cb1-dc1be727a020-1
00:23:17.331 --> 00:23:19.980
cage. The cage again has the
guard inside of it.

e2a16f3d-1926-4d21-b3fd-e97c2096e118-0
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.770
So now we see a very colorful,
colorful picture.

969b0c6f-f5e8-442b-9bb3-e133b608677b-0
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:38.975
You can see the man and the
little girl and they have the

969b0c6f-f5e8-442b-9bb3-e133b608677b-1
00:23:38.975 --> 00:23:43.659
crank device that is now
exploded into pieces and off to

969b0c6f-f5e8-442b-9bb3-e133b608677b-2
00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:48.671
the side is the large cage that
has the guard in it and once

969b0c6f-f5e8-442b-9bb3-e133b608677b-3
00:23:48.671 --> 00:23:50.890
that crank device exploded.

fac5ef22-2ae4-4c58-bc46-55f7a67d0728-0
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.930
Out came the flying.

08ac062a-e183-4994-97b4-1c3ac7b364c7-0
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.400
Purple animal.

a99b1bee-a993-4bd0-a461-54752fd8bed0-0
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:04.014
Along with the Purple Bird is
flying and there's all rainbow

a99b1bee-a993-4bd0-a461-54752fd8bed0-1
00:24:04.014 --> 00:24:09.242
colors swirling around in the
sky. There's blue and green,

a99b1bee-a993-4bd0-a461-54752fd8bed0-2
00:24:09.242 --> 00:24:11.280
orange, yellow, purple.

49e6c45a-b338-494d-b120-7c4f45b30ada-0
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.430
And there's also different
colored butterflies and

49e6c45a-b338-494d-b120-7c4f45b30ada-1
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.750
dragonflies. Red and yellow,
green, blue.

ba1ee381-06e3-4dad-99f8-69033254b718-0
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.680
And let's see.

3e157235-4cd9-4543-bde0-3573f44bea4b-0
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.878
The man and the girl are still
standing down near the edge of

3e157235-4cd9-4543-bde0-3573f44bea4b-1
00:24:29.878 --> 00:24:30.590
the water.

7461771a-586f-4ede-917f-ace27e4a3d57-0
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.217
Where we had seen the rock
formation with the small door

7461771a-586f-4ede-917f-ace27e4a3d57-1
00:24:34.217 --> 00:24:36.540
and they're standing right at
the edge there.

de82c128-f54e-4027-b37f-db287a77b072-0
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:43.854
Then we also see the Dragon boat
has come towards the open cave

de82c128-f54e-4027-b37f-db287a77b072-1
00:24:43.854 --> 00:24:48.700
in the in the water. So the
dragon boat is now a boat again.

9da4cf8a-e273-49af-b7fb-36e1ed096235-0
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.925
And there's two security guards
who are have their hands up in

9da4cf8a-e273-49af-b7fb-36e1ed096235-1
00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:54.700
front of them guarding
themselves.

e768f3de-c4f5-47f3-b4ee-1f01004240a9-0
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:03.138
And swirling above them are the
rainbow colors again with the

e768f3de-c4f5-47f3-b4ee-1f01004240a9-1
00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:04.340
butterflies.

b6c582c1-e58b-4726-a081-c76ef44f6f0f-0
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.650
And you can see the.

2d71c0bb-cd85-48b1-80a9-4e459a4b6788-0
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.740
King and the little boy have now
escaped.

02978325-9815-48c1-bf1b-13451e12c848-0
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.140
So now you can see the man and
the king.

dffd298e-7ed8-4865-b15e-11bc774534ba-0
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:26.326
Along with the little boy and
the little girl standing at the

dffd298e-7ed8-4865-b15e-11bc774534ba-1
00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:30.692
edge of the water, right near
that rock formation with a small

dffd298e-7ed8-4865-b15e-11bc774534ba-2
00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:34.920
door. Above them are flying all
the different colored birds.

6f320635-0cde-4144-a7f9-61595c384ce9-0
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.330
And butterflies.

630e6e07-aace-432e-8a84-1b9f2583ac5c-0
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.870
All the different colors purple,
green, blue, yellow, red.

c4a4feef-d9df-4b97-aab0-767136f60b92-0
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.678
And you can see in the distance
outside The Cave in the water as

c4a4feef-d9df-4b97-aab0-767136f60b92-1
00:25:48.678 --> 00:25:49.550
the dragon boat.

3458425b-183c-4bcd-ad63-c2584e9732f3-0
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.530
And it's going away from them
and has a couple guards on it.

a22e1b10-0740-4f15-8c25-3e999363ec8a-0
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.947
And it looks like coming out of
the water is the tail of a

a22e1b10-0740-4f15-8c25-3e999363ec8a-1
00:25:59.947 --> 00:26:00.390
purple.

a07633db-471a-4f71-ab6b-1dc78c33344a-0
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.760
Animal.

af81ac14-55ee-4362-832c-4c4d6325e7be-0
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.243
Above them is flying the purple
flying animal and it's carrying

af81ac14-55ee-4362-832c-4c4d6325e7be-1
00:26:09.243 --> 00:26:14.426
the the cage that I think still
has the guard trapped inside of

af81ac14-55ee-4362-832c-4c4d6325e7be-2
00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:14.750
him.

82cdc017-ee3c-4c8c-9035-c818fdefe910-0
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:16.680
Inside the cage.

d0df1e48-cc4b-4c55-a44d-5739eb44a56d-0
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.893
So now you can see the man, and
the little girl has the red pen

d0df1e48-cc4b-4c55-a44d-5739eb44a56d-1
00:26:22.893 --> 00:26:26.861
in her back pocket and she's
hugging the man, and the man is

d0df1e48-cc4b-4c55-a44d-5739eb44a56d-2
00:26:26.861 --> 00:26:30.764
kind of surprised that she's
hugging him. You can then also

d0df1e48-cc4b-4c55-a44d-5739eb44a56d-3
00:26:30.764 --> 00:26:31.610
see the king.

bc4186f1-c415-4a0d-9d8d-7968e7782579-0
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:36.670
Standing with the little boy and
on the King's arm is the purple

bc4186f1-c415-4a0d-9d8d-7968e7782579-1
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:36.990
bird.

ce44dde3-8171-4d4e-bf88-437271c2e967-0
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.869
The man and the little girl are
standing right near the small

ce44dde3-8171-4d4e-bf88-437271c2e967-1
00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:45.860
door that is now slightly open
and.

900aa08d-5e2d-42e4-a4e7-3ae8c007f99a-0
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.480
And leading out of that doorway.

ce0a3bcd-ea1b-464d-a8c9-74e859a961c0-0
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.180
Is the red tail of a kite.

fddc0b7d-91f5-4758-ae0f-dfb4a29de21d-0
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.630
So now we're back. Back to the
beginning where we saw the

fddc0b7d-91f5-4758-ae0f-dfb4a29de21d-1
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.890
house, the House where that we
saw the man in his office.

be4962fd-5f50-4558-bade-f3d04acea70b-0
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.030
And you can still see.

70c1e7b5-4fcd-40ab-87f4-3c6ce0e59c92-0
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.570
You can still see his his
office.

2d2efef2-7847-4b2e-96bf-2d50756ec572-0
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.730
You can see his desk.

5a5ad810-9928-4c54-9558-15974f91c84f-0
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.057
And remember, on that wall was a
small door, and that door is now

5a5ad810-9928-4c54-9558-15974f91c84f-1
00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:25.215
open. There's also a larger door
that's open leading out of his

5a5ad810-9928-4c54-9558-15974f91c84f-2
00:27:25.215 --> 00:27:25.669
office.

48cc27f1-9e7c-4795-b061-a1a65ff721b6-0
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.210
You can also see.

b014a3e1-16bc-43c6-816b-711291c26e8a-0
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.590
Uh.

85f523da-ce4a-4e51-9fd6-c69e989dd521-0
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:35.023
Below that you can see the
entryway where we saw the coat

85f523da-ce4a-4e51-9fd6-c69e989dd521-1
00:27:35.023 --> 00:27:40.164
tree and the entryway table and
the door leading to the to the

85f523da-ce4a-4e51-9fd6-c69e989dd521-2
00:27:40.164 --> 00:27:45.223
steps. You can see part of the
kitchen where we saw the stove

85f523da-ce4a-4e51-9fd6-c69e989dd521-3
00:27:45.223 --> 00:27:47.590
with some a pot on the stove.

8a487b7b-5967-495f-92f4-68910846c8a8-0
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:54.637
You can also see down below
what's like the basement where

8a487b7b-5967-495f-92f4-68910846c8a8-1
00:27:54.637 --> 00:27:58.790
you can see mechanical equipment
like a A.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.391
a water heater and an oil tank
that's Oval shaped and pipes

00:28:05.391 --> 00:28:10.674
leading to and from all of
those. And outside the building

bfd1e16b-d604-47d2-8443-728abd88410b-2
00:28:10.674 --> 00:28:15.330
you can see a lot of tall sky
skyscraper buildings.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.600
And below those is a Grove of
trees.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:21.840
Flying above.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.464
Flying outside the house and
above the trees is the red kite.

e6ffc688-768d-4f64-8828-4cd324576dfa-1

And now I'm going to share the
next one.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.480
OK, and now I'm gonna share my
screen.

ea86faf6-3028-42ae-8e4e-ef9de2f0b594-0
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:55.703
And this is just a complex
scene, so you'll have three

ea86faf6-3028-42ae-8e4e-ef9de2f0b594-1
00:28:55.703 --> 00:29:00.850
approximately 3 to 4 minutes to
describe the scene.

f409df22-09be-41d9-98c7-62b444c79ae8-0
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.870
And you could begin whenever
you're ready.

c7dc4c95-43ff-40c2-a9d4-27e616974f27-0
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.366
#START_make_a_splash So now
we're looking at a large picture

c7dc4c95-43ff-40c2-a9d4-27e616974f27-1
00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:15.330
with many, many people, both
adults and children.

4812fea3-f80e-4f0d-a31c-35248cf79f54-0
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.730
They're at a water park.

155f8cc7-d7f4-49c1-a9e2-5cf5cefae888-0
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.233
And so we can see the water, and
the water has a lot of people in

155f8cc7-d7f4-49c1-a9e2-5cf5cefae888-1
00:29:24.233 --> 00:29:24.410
it.

318ff8cf-bd18-4ecc-9266-eb5e37f0bfcf-0

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.320
There are slides that are
leading down to the water.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.290
And these slides.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:38.308
are water slides and they they
twist around and are mingled

a624e91a-4681-4424-a3fc-6f77028602ab-1
00:29:38.308 --> 00:29:42.464
together. So there's a green
slide that twists around and

a624e91a-4681-4424-a3fc-6f77028602ab-2
00:29:42.464 --> 00:29:47.121
leads down to the water. There's
a yellow one and there's also a

a624e91a-4681-4424-a3fc-6f77028602ab-3
00:29:47.121 --> 00:29:51.420
red one. And in every slide you
can see people entering the

a624e91a-4681-4424-a3fc-6f77028602ab-4
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:51.850

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.797
They're on the slide in the
water coming down and then at

66f2b533-dd6c-42c8-ae6b-90d7fd188787-1
00:29:55.797 --> 00:29:59.300
the very bottom you can see them
falling into into the water.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.090
In the water you can also see a
large boat.

bded0bbd-a5f2-432e-b7dc-97fb2fe80676-0
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.816
And the boat has a very large
slide that leads from the top

bded0bbd-a5f2-432e-b7dc-97fb2fe80676-1
00:30:10.816 --> 00:30:15.967
deck all the way down to the
water and the boats like a like

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.510
You can see a lot of people in

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.629
You can see some people are just
swimming or sitting and enjoying

f7d45fc7-174d-4d7d-bfe1-c37911aa383c-1
00:30:47.629 --> 00:30:52.644
it. Others are in little inner
tubes, floating and sitting on

f7d45fc7-174d-4d7d-bfe1-c37911aa383c-2

00:31:14.061 --> 00:31:19.052
large inflatable snake that's
floating in the water and kids

62c4157d-fb28-4a27-b88c-a1126e02588a-2
00:31:19.052 --> 00:31:24.123
are sitting on it. There are
also really big inflatable balls

62c4157d-fb28-4a27-b88c-a1126e02588a-3

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.091
Maybe they're not ball
inflatable and it looks like

ef784bd3-abb5-47c5-b01b-8177ea60d8a1-1
00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:37.890
there's water pouring out of
them.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:43.074
And the kids are enjoying being
splashed by the water

9c92fdd1-595b-4144-ac08-54b7bff6ffc5-1
00:31:43.074 --> 00:31:47.995
underneath. You also see a
really large slide on the right

9c92fdd1-595b-4144-ac08-54b7bff6ffc5-2
00:31:47.995 --> 00:31:49.830

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.206
And the slide has 123456
different slides coming down,

52315fe7-822d-4a4c-8511-7dbc5a1db06b-1
00:31:55.206 --> 00:32:00.341

cdfdda4a-3392-4c1d-aabf-1d02187c9d93-1
00:35:02.976 --> 00:35:09.188
like I said before. So just take
between 10:10 to 15 minutes to

cdfdda4a-3392-4c1d-aabf-1d02187c9d93-2
00:35:09.188 --> 00:35:14.430
describe the story and I will
share this full screen.

a25842d0-41b5-4149-ab46-0c973080479b-0
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:24.373
And let me know when you'd like
me to flip the page. New story,

a25842d0-41b5-4149-ab46-0c973080479b-1
00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:24.770
yes?

cda070c1-6a5e-41e0-ac75-3648cc7427ea-0
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:27.950
OK.

8877b26e-7326-4ed3-9d4d-d5b6e39d89cb-0
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.110
Wow. Where to begin? OK.

747b6548-f1ff-48a8-a195-c14dc7ae88a1-0
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.558
#START_flowerman So our story
begins with a person who's

747b6548-f1ff-48a8-a195-c14dc7ae88a1-1
00:35:45.558 --> 00:35:46.630
crossing over a.

655e4c12-1cf2-4612-b005-dab649fbd92e-0
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.031
A bridge and the bridge is
leading from one side of the

655e4c12-1cf2-4612-b005-dab649fbd92e-1
00:35:52.031 --> 00:35:57.016
land over to the other side of
the land, and underneath it

655e4c12-1cf2-4612-b005-dab649fbd92e-2
00:35:57.016 --> 00:35:58.030
looks to be.

7a4fdaa8-19ab-458c-844f-fb18bb8f238a-0
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.480
What used to be?

21e46a48-79be-4829-aebe-ac0cc647ecad-0
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:06.072
A lake, maybe, but the lake
doesn't have any water in it

21e46a48-79be-4829-aebe-ac0cc647ecad-1
00:36:06.072 --> 00:36:11.100
anymore. And in the bottom of
the lake you can see an old car

21e46a48-79be-4829-aebe-ac0cc647ecad-2
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.480
with a with broken windows you
can see an old anchor.

56ee5961-fc79-4137-af84-47a566d8dcdd-0
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.146
And you can see part of a
rowboat on the on the bottom of

56ee5961-fc79-4137-af84-47a566d8dcdd-1
00:36:21.146 --> 00:36:22.790
the of the dry lake.

d7e1e182-b8c8-425f-b1a5-a26af91a7e61-0
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.484
So you can see this person
walking over the bridge being

d7e1e182-b8c8-425f-b1a5-a26af91a7e61-1
00:36:29.484 --> 00:36:31.410
followed by a small animal.

db38c363-3a2f-41b4-bf31-ff392ccad33c-0
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.940
And the person is has a green
jacket.

6338585a-d55d-4102-b998-82aa880709ef-0
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.030
With a purple hat.

433dc76c-75b6-496e-9b20-5ed0b00dbb53-0
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.825
And on the small bridge that is
a curved top to the bridge on

433dc76c-75b6-496e-9b20-5ed0b00dbb53-1
00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:51.791
each corner, our street lights
and the person is right in the

433dc76c-75b6-496e-9b20-5ed0b00dbb53-2
00:36:51.791 --> 00:36:56.917
middle of the bridge and they're
walking to the other side that

433dc76c-75b6-496e-9b20-5ed0b00dbb53-3
00:36:56.917 --> 00:36:58.760
has a lot of buildings.

407c702e-aeb6-4269-a632-180d0044da09-0
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:05.674
So there's one smaller building
that has a sign that says gas,

407c702e-aeb6-4269-a632-180d0044da09-1
00:37:05.674 --> 00:37:11.325
and outside there is a man
standing next to the front door

407c702e-aeb6-4269-a632-180d0044da09-2
00:37:11.325 --> 00:37:13.050
and there's a gas.

bf776791-083b-4aa9-9983-f47ba9526851-0
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.860
It's a gas station with a gas
pump next to the door.

ccd1554f-b6f0-4a91-8bab-574b02813b7c-0
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:28.032
Next to that building is another
building with a striped roof,

ccd1554f-b6f0-4a91-8bab-574b02813b7c-1
00:37:28.032 --> 00:37:32.500
and there's a sign above the
doorway that says bar.

d884d2ae-e3ed-4deb-88fb-6fd1484cbbe5-0
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.934
And that building is a two-story
building and to the side of the

d884d2ae-e3ed-4deb-88fb-6fd1484cbbe5-1
00:37:38.934 --> 00:37:41.910
building is a set of stairs that
go up.

ed386e8f-22d7-4fca-8d78-17a077f10826-0
00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:47.839
Towards a door, and then the
steps turn and go up another

ed386e8f-22d7-4fca-8d78-17a077f10826-1
00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:49.550
level to another door.

c9f72f4e-dde0-4062-b4a9-74bee52fefe7-0
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.919
Between the bar and the next
building is an old pickup truck

c9f72f4e-dde0-4062-b4a9-74bee52fefe7-1
00:37:56.919 --> 00:38:01.732
that is parked. In the back of
the pickup truck has wood rails

c9f72f4e-dde0-4062-b4a9-74bee52fefe7-2
00:38:01.732 --> 00:38:06.544
on the side of it and that one
is parked right near a building

c9f72f4e-dde0-4062-b4a9-74bee52fefe7-3
00:38:06.544 --> 00:38:11.510
with a sign that says bait shop
and the building has a door with

c9f72f4e-dde0-4062-b4a9-74bee52fefe7-4
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.420
one window with shutters.

1303cb52-0476-48bb-89ab-1b052948ede4-0
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.880
And in the roof are two like
dormer windows.

a61a25a3-4b92-48ac-8016-fbfdccc7ec27-0
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.110
That bait shop is right on the
corner of a street.

e1b00658-d025-474a-9c44-95c9894c3594-0
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.310
And um, across.

d0ea6dc9-92a5-466d-9835-a9e8af9dc9f0-0
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.191
Walking from across the street
is another person walking

d0ea6dc9-92a5-466d-9835-a9e8af9dc9f0-1
00:38:31.191 --> 00:38:32.420
towards the bait shop.

f16c1f06-e070-48cc-ab98-e90faf410e04-0
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.569
On the other corner, across from
the bait shop, is a a large

f16c1f06-e070-48cc-ab98-e90faf410e04-1
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:43.111
building that looks like it has
a very large garage door, but

f16c1f06-e070-48cc-ab98-e90faf410e04-2
00:38:43.111 --> 00:38:47.800
there's no sign on it, so we're
not sure what that building is.

f16c1f06-e070-48cc-ab98-e90faf410e04-3
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.610
Behind those buildings are lots
of other buildings.

efe46277-3e21-48db-a7d8-87711bf1e264-0
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:58.379
OK, so the one door that has the
large garage door on it does

efe46277-3e21-48db-a7d8-87711bf1e264-1
00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:01.580
have a sign off the side of it
that says garage.

ea4caecc-361f-40de-b107-a44e559617f6-0
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.620
So behind all those buildings
look to be.

688f4999-b69b-4d9a-ba86-c0e1df830425-0
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.420
Homes.

78fb6a87-130a-4b6f-95e2-72484f999855-0
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.108
You can see one tall building
with some windows and a person

78fb6a87-130a-4b6f-95e2-72484f999855-1
00:39:13.108 --> 00:39:17.227
is standing in the window, and
from one house to the next is a

78fb6a87-130a-4b6f-95e2-72484f999855-2
00:39:17.227 --> 00:39:20.170
clothesline with some clothes
hanging on it.

76bf91b2-e1f5-463a-b00b-9ca28994d1f1-0
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:28.343
On the other side, where we
started with the gas station,

76bf91b2-e1f5-463a-b00b-9ca28994d1f1-1
00:39:28.343 --> 00:39:32.740
next to that gas station looks
to be a circus tent is set up.

f4acfbda-94ec-462b-9a32-9b547ffccd99-0
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:39.370
Right on the corner, right on
the edge of the of the dry lake.

1f61db34-4f4e-4fe4-9de0-6496815e78f7-0
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.300
And behind them is a large
Ferris wheel.

804a7229-4e2b-4ffa-b01e-f8d9cf43997b-0
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.050
Behind the gas station is a
large Ferris wheel.

88b7e999-f280-431a-af36-91e30944d69a-0
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:49.180
OK.

5c26d1ee-54ac-457f-b891-8b4e9a556601-0
00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.251
So now we can see the person who
has had crossed the bridge with

5c26d1ee-54ac-457f-b891-8b4e9a556601-1
00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:01.510
the green jacket.

9e16928b-3680-4fb5-8b31-6feccccde900-0
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:07.260
Has a blue hat and an orange
scarf. They're carrying a blue

9e16928b-3680-4fb5-8b31-6feccccde900-1
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.060
umbrella that is not open and
carrying a bag in their hand.

355bed89-d794-42a7-9b69-824f3c85a217-0
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.750
And they have a.

91a7934e-6e4b-4f6b-95bf-3a9d387e51d3-0
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.151
I think some type of animal
following them. They're walking

91a7934e-6e4b-4f6b-95bf-3a9d387e51d3-1
00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:24.313
down the street in between all
of the houses that we saw in the

91a7934e-6e4b-4f6b-95bf-3a9d387e51d3-2
00:40:24.313 --> 00:40:27.110
other picture and all the other
buildings.

2a1f0ecc-4c43-4933-845a-f36b6e0efe07-0
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.530
You can see another building.

6c357f0c-3147-4a59-b318-845427a98ca9-0
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.900
Up ahead of the person.

7246db88-23a4-473a-9872-31b5136eb352-0
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:40.391
That has a sign outside that
says CAFE and it's a three story

7246db88-23a4-473a-9872-31b5136eb352-1
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:41.240
building.

a7f3260e-1c8d-42ee-891a-b1b4eed40b5e-0
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.450
The front door is a large arched
doorway up two steps.

406d50a8-f34f-455b-ab85-f1c01aa5efac-0
00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.347
And then above that, on that
next level you can see into some

406d50a8-f34f-455b-ab85-f1c01aa5efac-1
00:40:51.347 --> 00:40:52.240
of the windows.

60943451-2c47-46fa-863c-6fea13268ddb-0
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.810
And one of the windows you can
see two people.

84713005-0491-4bb1-92f0-6ab042fd64d4-0
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.010
Talking. These might be
apartments above the cafe.

a7680bd6-50ea-4835-a430-1e6af3577414-0
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.640
And you can see another person
sitting.

0efdaa57-02f5-4813-9eb1-831fa6d2c7e9-0
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.970
And you can see another person
maybe.

2d419e83-ea23-4dc1-98a8-6aca7912a4b4-0
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.090
Jumping on her bed.

8bb67916-5548-4f5e-a325-2a346326af20-0
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:16.063
And you can see another into
another window with a couple

8bb67916-5548-4f5e-a325-2a346326af20-1
00:41:16.063 --> 00:41:16.550
people.

8b1d68d5-fede-485d-8c0d-4012d345edd0-0
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.900
There is.

eabd1aa6-1f6e-46aa-91d4-f34244c58739-0
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:26.334
So the the person in the green
jacket walking in the street is

eabd1aa6-1f6e-46aa-91d4-f34244c58739-1
00:41:26.334 --> 00:41:28.310
standing right below a street
light.

0d07144b-e35c-4083-8b0d-0d9394cd5d6e-0
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.641
And on that corner is another
building that looks like a

0d07144b-e35c-4083-8b0d-0d9394cd5d6e-1
00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:33.030
house.

858c290e-06aa-42ba-84c8-04c278683055-0
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:39.174
And it has above it the front
doors. There are two windows

858c290e-06aa-42ba-84c8-04c278683055-1
00:41:39.174 --> 00:41:40.360
with shutters.

45c2755b-fe31-4d20-86db-0c1fa116ae70-0
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.200
And above that looks to be like
a a small attic.

c9659b73-7e40-4ac2-91b6-d8bae53fcfec-0
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:51.922
With a window with shutters and
a child or a person looking out

c9659b73-7e40-4ac2-91b6-d8bae53fcfec-1
00:41:51.922 --> 00:41:52.900
that window.

3fddd024-6e8e-4783-834d-3e76e7981d0e-0
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.347
Right outside to the side of
that building, you can see a

3fddd024-6e8e-4783-834d-3e76e7981d0e-1
00:41:59.347 --> 00:41:59.600
man.

3643f384-8214-4f7b-bfd2-74f5b91c4ce4-0
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.440
Talking with a young boy, the
man does not look like he's very

3643f384-8214-4f7b-bfd2-74f5b91c4ce4-1
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.890
happy.

8447876a-660f-47a1-bc1e-6fce999e6544-0
00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.994
On the other side of the person
who's walking in the street, you

8447876a-660f-47a1-bc1e-6fce999e6544-1
00:42:12.994 --> 00:42:15.120
can see another building on the
corner.

5df12177-073a-4bde-981b-08603aa04610-0
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.533
Where I do not see a sign as to
what kind of building it is

5df12177-073a-4bde-981b-08603aa04610-1
00:42:20.533 --> 00:42:24.216
looks to have a shop on the
bottom floor and maybe

5df12177-073a-4bde-981b-08603aa04610-2
00:42:24.216 --> 00:42:28.549
apartments on the upper floor
and you can see a little girl

5df12177-073a-4bde-981b-08603aa04610-3
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:33.099

the side street in front of that

5df12177-073a-4bde-981b-08603aa04610-4
00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:33.749
building.

459b4e98-ffff-4faf-a48c-1738826ed617-0
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.320
Coming towards her on the street
is someone on a motorcycle.

ba18f049-2c30-4534-bf32-f96a3aaac65a-0
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.603
Oh, you also see another
building. The person in the

ba18f049-2c30-4534-bf32-f96a3aaac65a-1
00:42:49.603 --> 00:42:54.954
green jacket is walking towards
another building that has a very

ba18f049-2c30-4534-bf32-f96a3aaac65a-2
00:42:54.954 --> 00:42:55.860
steep roof.

d4e6996a-f015-4f39-a96d-0999893ad429-0
00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:02.314
And there's a set of glass doors
that lead out of the top of that

d4e6996a-f015-4f39-a96d-0999893ad429-1
00:43:02.314 --> 00:43:07.283
house or roof onto a small
porch. And on that porch is a

d4e6996a-f015-4f39-a96d-0999893ad429-2
00:43:07.283 --> 00:43:12.601
young boy who's standing there
who doesn't look happy, looks

d4e6996a-f015-4f39-a96d-0999893ad429-3
00:43:12.601 --> 00:43:18.181
like he has his eyes closed and
he's frowning and there's a cat

d4e6996a-f015-4f39-a96d-0999893ad429-4
00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:21.930
sitting on the on the railing

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:30.431
So now you can still see all of
the buildings and the

a17651ad-62c5-464d-8b59-73f353cefff8-1
00:43:30.431 --> 00:43:34.774
cobblestone street. The streets,
all full of cobblestones, and

a17651ad-62c5-464d-8b59-73f353cefff8-2
00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:39.047
you can see the person in the
green jacket is standing on the

a17651ad-62c5-464d-8b59-73f353cefff8-3
00:43:39.047 --> 00:43:39.530
corner.

e863030a-0d1c-493b-9f9f-a6c3fc85c639-0
00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:45.025
Under a street light and is
looking towards a very small

e863030a-0d1c-493b-9f9f-a6c3fc85c639-1
00:43:45.025 --> 00:43:49.640
house that is very run down,
very dilapidated and in the

e863030a-0d1c-493b-9f9f-a6c3fc85c639-2
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.960
front lawn is a sign that says

5d2433bc-4d8c-49b8-bdc8-2af538f8cdf0-0
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.120
That house is next to.

31f23fa6-f120-43fd-8745-2d11737682b3-0
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.495
Some of the other buildings we
saw that looked to have

31f23fa6-f120-43fd-8745-2d11737682b3-1
00:44:02.495 --> 00:44:06.440
businesses on the bottom floor
with apartments up above it.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.960
So this little house is real.

d4ae0d39-8bab-41d6-ae54-a91aab84cddf-0
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.880
Real small and the all the
buildings around it are real

d4ae0d39-8bab-41d6-ae54-a91aab84cddf-1
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.825
tall, like two or three stories,
kind of towering over the small

d4ae0d39-8bab-41d6-ae54-a91aab84cddf-2
00:44:18.825 --> 00:44:23.618
house. In all of the houses or
buildings around it you can see

d4ae0d39-8bab-41d6-ae54-a91aab84cddf-3
00:44:23.618 --> 00:44:27.498
Windows are open. All the
windows have shutters or

d4ae0d39-8bab-41d6-ae54-a91aab84cddf-4
00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:32.367
canopies over the top of them.
You can see people inside. Looks

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.880
Sitting and chatting with with
other people. One of them you

67b0a9e2-30d4-4420-9d52-522e7547bdab-1
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.583

an artist's easel drawing a

67b0a9e2-30d4-4420-9d52-522e7547bdab-2
00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:46.210
picture.

24937e1e-562f-43b0-9883-b85579b55ceb-0
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.240
Along the cobblestone street.

e2e281e3-2892-4a8b-81c8-331be41c008e-0
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:56.534
You can see people standing
outside businesses chatting.

e2e281e3-2892-4a8b-81c8-331be41c008e-1
00:44:56.534 --> 00:45:01.806
There's there's two men who are
chatting on the corner. One has

e2e281e3-2892-4a8b-81c8-331be41c008e-2

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:15.833
Playing in this in the street,
or walking in the street next to

1ddf15aa-a45f-49ac-8b0a-ce21e0bfe81c-1
00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:20.397
them. There's also some people
just lounging by the fountain, a

1ddf15aa-a45f-49ac-8b0a-ce21e0bfe81c-2
00:45:20.397 --> 00:45:24.533

OK.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.248
So now in this picture you can
still see all of the tall

96aa72a1-3fef-43a4-a40d-5c5ba06cb286-1
00:45:40.248 --> 00:45:43.541

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:49.347
And you can see the the man in
the green Jack or the person in

ce1dc906-b40e-4c34-b66f-9cc7d00d4d80-1

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.099
Turns out to be an old man and
the old man now has his jacket

0a4f6455-a9cd-4a42-bb1f-85e7f4797948-3
00:46:04.459 --> 00:46:08.500

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:30.320
OK.

still all inside of those
windows. There's still people in

875bc65e-6a86-46ca-a77c-041877c60bce-3
00:48:47.895 --> 00:48:48.210
the.

c7ae51a3-8be9-4426-9969-02bbad03f2ed-0
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:53.695
In the street there's a little
boy over by the fountain.

c7ae51a3-8be9-4426-9969-02bbad03f2ed-1
00:48:53.695 --> 00:48:58.866
There's a food vendor pushing a
food cart, selling something, a

c7ae51a3-8be9-4426-9969-02bbad03f2ed-2
00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:00.240
man on a scooter.

0e76c8d1-0522-4725-934b-1f9c1b651eb9-0
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:07.209
You can see people sitting on
the front steps or walking down

0e76c8d1-0522-4725-934b-1f9c1b651eb9-1
00:49:07.209 --> 00:49:08.170
the sidewalk.

513fcf81-6771-4a2a-a301-965c3e55ecf3-0
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:13.491
There's someone who looks like a
milkman, maybe delivering some

513fcf81-6771-4a2a-a301-965c3e55ecf3-1
00:49:13.491 --> 00:49:17.930
milk to one of the houses. You
can see the artist is taking a

513fcf81-6771-4a2a-a301-965c3e55ecf3-2
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:22.368
break, sitting on the windowsill
of his open window, and he's

513fcf81-6771-4a2a-a301-965c3e55ecf3-3
00:49:22.368 --> 00:49:26.950
holding his artist palette with
all the different paints on it.

f0b49f2f-1643-449e-8e94-3d6c4c56f6d1-0
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.150
And over on the.

1fee56bd-2aee-40b4-888c-b9de501753c6-0
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.434
Other side you can see two
little girls talking and

1fee56bd-2aee-40b4-888c-b9de501753c6-1
00:49:35.434 --> 00:49:36.110
playing.

da7c53df-2303-46aa-8c6d-4b45283bc978-0
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.980
And right on the corner.

90b10313-f79d-4b55-84fe-dda3320ef750-0
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:44.464
Is the House that the old man
has fixed up and it looks really

90b10313-f79d-4b55-84fe-dda3320ef750-1
00:49:44.464 --> 00:49:44.810
nice.

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-0
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.101
The man is out in his front yard
and he's planted some flowers

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-1
00:49:50.101 --> 00:49:54.630
all along his wood fence and
he's picked some flowers and has

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-2
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.721
them in his right in his right
hand, and he's waving to

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-3
00:49:58.721 --> 00:50:02.739
somebody with his left hand.
He's kneeling down on the

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-4
00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:07.267
ground. The grass looks really
green and cut. You can see the

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-5
00:50:07.267 --> 00:50:11.869
little dog is standing there.
You can see the blue shutters on

846df2b1-233a-413a-97e4-d8311b3d66b4-6
00:50:11.869 --> 00:50:15.229
the two windows on his house.
Look very nice.

7c9afc81-b01a-41fa-9bb0-5f9ff31ce548-0
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:21.106
You can see into his house with
a Big Blue chair in one of the

7c9afc81-b01a-41fa-9bb0-5f9ff31ce548-1
00:50:21.106 --> 00:50:26.092
rooms, and in each of those
windows are flower boxes with

7c9afc81-b01a-41fa-9bb0-5f9ff31ce548-2
00:50:26.092 --> 00:50:28.500
flowers growing out of them.

3c7973fe-cfd3-4876-a2de-48929dfd29d8-0
00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:34.729
The blue or the purple roof is
much more purple now, so he must

3c7973fe-cfd3-4876-a2de-48929dfd29d8-1
00:50:34.729 --> 00:50:39.359
have painted it. It's a very
beautiful purple with with a

3c7973fe-cfd3-4876-a2de-48929dfd29d8-2
00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:43.989
flower boxes in the windows that
are in the second story.

a9bb41c3-c48a-4dd3-98bd-abf508eb6843-0
00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.500
Coming out from the roof.

5a317083-b0b5-470e-9f3f-9f95525b1ef1-0
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:55.023
You can also see a large tree is
now in bloom that must be on the

5a317083-b0b5-470e-9f3f-9f95525b1ef1-1
00:50:55.023 --> 00:51:01.366
in his backyard and the tree is
very large and is orange and

5a317083-b0b5-470e-9f3f-9f95525b1ef1-2
00:51:01.366 --> 00:51:05.630
yellow and has some small white
flowers.

9ef7b21f-4474-43b6-9133-a97acb5d8a28-0
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:08.970
On the corner of the house is a
street light.

4b1fc56d-ea93-4795-b28d-69e8aef9ecbe-0
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:14.105
And at the bottom of that street
light is a man with a mask and a

4b1fc56d-ea93-4795-b28d-69e8aef9ecbe-1
00:51:14.105 --> 00:51:14.500
black.

9101e280-84ed-46bf-86b5-0e0e40471143-0
00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:21.388
He has a black eye mask and a
Black Hat, and he looks to be

9101e280-84ed-46bf-86b5-0e0e40471143-1
00:51:21.388 --> 00:51:23.390
spying on the old man.

256e2287-e8e7-4663-89ab-2265c4317f22-0
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.087
Now we see the same picture
again with the small house

256e2287-e8e7-4663-89ab-2265c4317f22-1
00:51:36.087 --> 00:51:40.066
that's been fixed up and around
it, the two and three story

256e2287-e8e7-4663-89ab-2265c4317f22-2
00:51:40.066 --> 00:51:40.730
buildings.

e661b7bb-91d8-4c00-b958-5cd668e29b87-0
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.884
And now it looks like other
people are starting to fix up

e661b7bb-91d8-4c00-b958-5cd668e29b87-1
00:51:45.884 --> 00:51:49.533
their buildings so you can see
some of the shutters have been

e661b7bb-91d8-4c00-b958-5cd668e29b87-2
00:51:49.533 --> 00:51:50.240
painted red.

d5670cb6-8673-4999-9b41-23f7198190df-0
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:53.970
Some of them blue.

b22ef407-2139-40f4-8b67-2440fbcf5380-0
00:51:54.670 --> 00:52:00.187
The canopies have been cleaned
up and are striped purple and

b22ef407-2139-40f4-8b67-2440fbcf5380-1
00:52:00.187 --> 00:52:00.730
lilac.

706ccf3e-f2ad-4dca-80b1-c1627858ccb5-0
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.890
You can see.

66923c57-4952-48dc-ae46-62a74ca56d35-0
00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:09.040
In in all of the windows, you
can still see inside in some of

66923c57-4952-48dc-ae46-62a74ca56d35-1
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.837
the apartments, and it looks
like maybe they've started to

66923c57-4952-48dc-ae46-62a74ca56d35-2
00:52:12.837 --> 00:52:16.570
fix up some of their apartments.
You can see the artist's

66923c57-4952-48dc-ae46-62a74ca56d35-3
00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:20.753
apartment and he's got an orange
wall and he's out on his window

66923c57-4952-48dc-ae46-62a74ca56d35-4
00:52:20.753 --> 00:52:21.140
ledge.

e7f5550d-00be-46c2-9dea-605b8325ca33-0
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:27.241
With the big doors open to the
window or shutters open to the

e7f5550d-00be-46c2-9dea-605b8325ca33-1
00:52:27.241 --> 00:52:27.760
window.

baa4b8a7-ee48-4c21-9398-fe440ebe01f4-0
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.680
And he's looking out.

95d7aeea-598c-4c18-a494-9b2f25f17dd6-0
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.249
In the street below you can see
a truck that says movers and

95d7aeea-598c-4c18-a494-9b2f25f17dd6-1
00:52:35.249 --> 00:52:39.153
shakers, and there are some
people who are moving some

95d7aeea-598c-4c18-a494-9b2f25f17dd6-2
00:52:39.153 --> 00:52:39.650
things.

bdf81c28-c9d1-48ad-89e8-ec4db352eb55-0
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.992
In or out of the truck, not sure
what, there's a man holding a

bdf81c28-c9d1-48ad-89e8-ec4db352eb55-1
00:52:45.992 --> 00:52:51.001
box with a lamp and another man
with a blue shirt and a blue

bdf81c28-c9d1-48ad-89e8-ec4db352eb55-2
00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:51.330
hat.

54a0d2bd-1c39-4d4c-8422-67246364d34f-0
00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.260
Over by the fountain is still
the little boy leaning on the

54a0d2bd-1c39-4d4c-8422-67246364d34f-1
00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.020
edge of the fountain playing.

5997b080-323d-4502-94bd-0d15b43efe49-0
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:05.291
In the street you can see an old
old lady with a blue skirt and a

5997b080-323d-4502-94bd-0d15b43efe49-1
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:06.070
pink shirt.

ffa970a0-1ecd-4b19-97c5-ac5c30340ce4-0
00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:12.075
Gray hair and glasses and she's
talking to a man. They're

ffa970a0-1ecd-4b19-97c5-ac5c30340ce4-1
00:53:12.075 --> 00:53:17.367
looking towards one of the
buildings and looking towards

ffa970a0-1ecd-4b19-97c5-ac5c30340ce4-2
00:53:17.367 --> 00:53:18.760
the moving van.

6f95da76-763d-443b-9205-bd79f5ef69fe-0
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:24.372
Over on the other side, where
the old man has fixed up his

6f95da76-763d-443b-9205-bd79f5ef69fe-1
00:53:24.372 --> 00:53:28.386
house, you can still see the old
man with his blue shirt and

6f95da76-763d-443b-9205-bd79f5ef69fe-2
00:53:28.386 --> 00:53:31.150
brown pants, and he's wearing
suspenders.

0e85aa8e-447c-4ceb-bad2-d19bc1418afc-0
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:37.642
And he's talking to a little
girl who has red hair and red

0e85aa8e-447c-4ceb-bad2-d19bc1418afc-1
00:53:37.642 --> 00:53:42.882
glasses and a green sweater and
a blue skirt. And there's a

0e85aa8e-447c-4ceb-bad2-d19bc1418afc-2
00:53:42.882 --> 00:53:45.240
young boy approaching them.

6ba2db09-92a2-4fd7-aac3-773ccd964ec6-0
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:50.259
And the young boy has brown hair
and a green shirt and blue

6ba2db09-92a2-4fd7-aac3-773ccd964ec6-1
00:53:50.259 --> 00:53:50.660
pants.

3cd89287-cfbf-4658-88cf-885f79733e89-0
00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:57.107
And next to them, standing on
the sidewalk, is another man

3cd89287-cfbf-4658-88cf-885f79733e89-1
00:53:57.107 --> 00:53:57.440
and.

ab2fce1e-9766-40ae-a553-c41755670a83-0
00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.840
Young boy, maybe.

a58758ce-cd12-47af-9960-a7d83b98af5f-0
00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:08.562
And the the man is wearing a
yellow shirt that's too short so

a58758ce-cd12-47af-9960-a7d83b98af5f-1
00:54:08.562 --> 00:54:13.414
you can see his tummy sticking
out and and purple pants and

a58758ce-cd12-47af-9960-a7d83b98af5f-2
00:54:13.414 --> 00:54:18.750
he's got red hair, very dark red
hair. And he's holding a flower.

a58758ce-cd12-47af-9960-a7d83b98af5f-3
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:23.520
And you can still see the old
man's house is fixed up very

a58758ce-cd12-47af-9960-a7d83b98af5f-4
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.239
nice with this purple roof and
blue shutters.

d769f80e-abd4-4ed0-b20c-38613fb3f08b-0
00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:32.882
And its grass and flowers are
growing and the orange tree is

d769f80e-abd4-4ed0-b20c-38613fb3f08b-1
00:54:32.882 --> 00:54:33.750
is growing.

704113f9-a9ca-41c0-b0e0-55cf7c7c5559-0
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.280
And standing on the corner under
the streetlight.

ec3be389-89a0-4d64-8f19-02e64a6fe547-0
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.030
Is another.

f3fc6322-795a-429a-b83d-d64ccb9a05e7-0
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:44.960
Man with black pants and a white
shirt and a pink tie.

c4edc788-2027-41e0-a476-65fb9deb5892-0
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:47.390
And.

d74396d8-8ed2-4354-8507-ac6c8ff6766b-0
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:53.074
I think he might also be holding
some of the flowers. There's

d74396d8-8ed2-4354-8507-ac6c8ff6766b-1
00:54:53.074 --> 00:54:57.232
lots of people all around.
There's a street vendor behind

d74396d8-8ed2-4354-8507-ac6c8ff6766b-2
00:54:57.232 --> 00:55:01.247
the house that looks to be
dressed up like a clown or a

d74396d8-8ed2-4354-8507-ac6c8ff6766b-3
00:55:01.247 --> 00:55:05.620
clown face pushing a vendors
cart across the street. You can

d74396d8-8ed2-4354-8507-ac6c8ff6766b-4
00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:10.065
see an old man standing outside
the building with a sign says

d74396d8-8ed2-4354-8507-ac6c8ff6766b-5
00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:13.220
Coca-Cola on the side side of
the building.

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:17.889
And the old man is being hugged
by a little girl with red hair

4923dfa4-5071-4465-a4b9-df21511a624e-1
00:55:17.889 --> 00:55:21.240

So now you can still see all of
the two and three story

3becbce8-c09e-447e-8a52-71205a650bbf-1
00:55:43.426 --> 00:55:47.107

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:39.049
And behind him you can see the
street vendor that has the the

55962ef2-9a6e-48a3-84cc-a5c55c08e39f-1
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:42.680
clown clown face pushing the
vendor cart.

08e8e11e-5e4b-4a19-9bc0-6b5ce6c70836-0
01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.847
The clown is wearing a green
shirt with brown pants and a

08e8e11e-5e4b-4a19-9bc0-6b5ce6c70836-1
01:01:47.847 --> 01:01:52.204
yellow tie, and he's got orange
hair and a big Red Nose and he's

08e8e11e-5e4b-4a19-9bc0-6b5ce6c70836-2
01:01:52.204 --> 01:01:53.880
talking to a little girl.

b27c8977-7fe2-40d3-ac1b-72298534f8e1-0
01:01:58.790 --> 01:01:59.810
Let's see.

cd8b8d76-b64e-423d-90fb-9b1b2922a908-0
01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.815
So now we can still see the
neighborhood, and it's even more

cd8b8d76-b64e-423d-90fb-9b1b2922a908-1
01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:08.280
colorful and beautiful than it
was before.

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-0
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.282
Everything has become colored
and isn't black and Gray any

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-1
01:02:13.282 --> 01:02:17.834
longer. There's still a lot of
people out playing. You can see

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-2
01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:22.386
people in all of the windows of
the houses. You can see people

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-3
01:02:22.386 --> 01:02:27.010
on top of the houses on decks on
top of the houses. You can see

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-4
01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:31.200
the old man's house is still
there on the corner with the

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-5
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.752
flowers and the wood fence and
the dog and the green grass and

66c73bec-0531-46b4-a81c-d64137e83baf-6
01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.570
the blue shutters and the purple
roof.

bca09c6c-60ed-41c8-83df-0e95be1c1b81-0
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:45.120
And I do not see the old man at
his house right now.

22845db0-087f-4830-ba83-a0f0ef8d805d-0
01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.751
The milk truck is still parked
next to his house, between his

22845db0-087f-4830-ba83-a0f0ef8d805d-1
01:02:49.751 --> 01:02:51.490
house and the Coca-Cola
building.

f1a4d02a-7bac-425e-9e83-d25215a64ea1-0
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:56.425
And in front of the Coca-Cola
building, walking away from the

f1a4d02a-7bac-425e-9e83-d25215a64ea1-1
01:02:56.425 --> 01:03:00.323
old man's house, is the old man,
and he's now back in his green

f1a4d02a-7bac-425e-9e83-d25215a64ea1-2
01:03:00.323 --> 01:03:00.750
jacket.

f70b29c2-3fa3-4ed4-b32d-11ec786d494c-0
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:02.370
And his.

bfedb8ad-6ed2-4eca-a4e2-008a10c937c1-0
01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:07.673
Orange scarf and his hat with a
little orange flower off the top

bfedb8ad-6ed2-4eca-a4e2-008a10c937c1-1
01:03:07.673 --> 01:03:12.083
of his hat. The old man has a
big white mustache, by the way,

bfedb8ad-6ed2-4eca-a4e2-008a10c937c1-2
01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:13.720
and he's holding a bag.

9414581f-b8cb-4050-8e3d-562ddbbd45ac-0
01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:21.168
In all of the buildings you can
still see some of the same

9414581f-b8cb-4050-8e3d-562ddbbd45ac-1
01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:26.006
things. You can see the artist's
building, you can see the

9414581f-b8cb-4050-8e3d-562ddbbd45ac-2
01:03:26.006 --> 01:03:31.173
picture he's painted, but the
artist is not not there. You can

9414581f-b8cb-4050-8e3d-562ddbbd45ac-3
01:03:31.173 --> 01:03:36.011
see the mailman sitting on the
steps outside the red brick

9414581f-b8cb-4050-8e3d-562ddbbd45ac-4
01:03:36.011 --> 01:03:36.750
building.

e56bdfda-9961-4b69-8a84-2b3e16d8368f-0
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.960
And he's taking a break and he's
got a he's holding a dog.

0935dadd-6ffd-46f1-99be-ae05838a194c-0
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:47.268
In in the street you can see the
man with a broken leg in the

0935dadd-6ffd-46f1-99be-ae05838a194c-1
01:03:47.268 --> 01:03:50.087
wheelchair and he's Wheeling
down the street with kids

0935dadd-6ffd-46f1-99be-ae05838a194c-2
01:03:50.087 --> 01:03:51.010
running after him.

7afe6c85-213a-4c52-bc67-001b17b77f17-0
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:57.360
Kicking. They're kicking a ball.
You can see another dog.

4dcd3553-4060-4bad-a319-bcbf913292b7-0
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.928
Chasing along with them, you can
see the man with the orange hair

4dcd3553-4060-4bad-a319-bcbf913292b7-1
01:04:02.928 --> 01:04:07.370
and the yellow shirt. That's too
short for him, and he's also

4dcd3553-4060-4bad-a319-bcbf913292b7-2
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:11.453

somebody on his shoulders and

somebody pushing behind him.

c69f8036-3248-4cf9-aad1-599f32359693-0
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:17.830
You can see the fountain.

e0ba5912-335d-4a31-abf3-8c67ef30a494-0

01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:29.979
look happy. And you can see an
older couple walking down the

e0ba5912-335d-4a31-abf3-8c67ef30a494-3

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:38.269
With smiles on their faces, the
old lady has a orange red top

e58510a7-4d5f-4d36-8bda-8ab3e332cb56-1
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:39.910

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.031
And the man has light colored
pants with a light blue shirt

3e7bbabb-9976-4054-9836-c829295d8134-1
01:04:46.031 --> 01:04:49.960
and they look to be very happy
with each other.

4f6217c0-1ef7-403e-a8aa-73da108cc452-0
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:55.348
You can see a lot of people kind
of dancing and playing in the

4f6217c0-1ef7-403e-a8aa-73da108cc452-1
01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:58.220
street, somebody playing their
guitar.

28683890-59cd-46ae-9911-e81bec7ffd42-0
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.010
Umm.

7dffc25c-c111-442a-a2b8-865d84dbc73b-0
01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.892
OK, except on top of the
building there are some open

7dffc25c-c111-442a-a2b8-865d84dbc73b-1
01:05:06.892 --> 01:05:11.591
decks. So on top of the
Coca-Cola building that has the

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:18.600
Kind of deck area with a flower
box with flowers growing.

2a3ebd55-47ea-4fba-924f-76fefd0ecb36-0
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.389
And there's an old man with a
white beard and bald, with a

2a3ebd55-47ea-4fba-924f-76fefd0ecb36-1
01:05:23.389 --> 01:05:28.031
little bit of white hair, with a

01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:32.111
a little boy who's looking
through a telescope. There's a

2a3ebd55-47ea-4fba-924f-76fefd0ecb36-3
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:36.401
little boy and a little girl.
The little girl's pointing off

2a3ebd55-47ea-4fba-924f-76fefd0ecb36-4
01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:38.090
to something in the sky.

dbd3fe97-c08d-42e9-9661-c11f2b933c6d-0
01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.790
Um.

a6cd3635-a6fe-41be-a612-c7bc2f55112c-0
01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:43.620
On top of the.

19b47dee-4256-4385-9ab0-57b407d9a305-0
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:51.281
Building with the artist's
apartment there is a purple

19b47dee-4256-4385-9ab0-57b407d9a305-1
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:51.870
roof.

1a55c75a-146e-4b45-b6c3-4669a0635dea-0
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.652
And on top of the roof is a very
large man who only is wearing a

1a55c75a-146e-4b45-b6c3-4669a0635dea-1
01:05:58.652 --> 01:06:00.610
towel around his waist.

2e40c2e5-2a88-4b7a-afcc-2d3b225dc0e9-0
01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:06.122
And he looks happy and looks
like he's dancing on his rooftop

2e40c2e5-2a88-4b7a-afcc-2d3b225dc0e9-1
01:06:06.122 --> 01:06:09.810
and he's holding flowers or
something in his hand.

44580ce2-80fd-464a-ac35-e143f469323b-0
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:12.550
{Here.}

d39e513b-b78a-416f-a671-3a263ca66b21-0
01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.144
So now we can see the
cobblestone streets with the

d39e513b-b78a-416f-a671-3a263ca66b21-1
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:25.456
buildings, and these are the
buildings that we saw earlier.

d39e513b-b78a-416f-a671-3a263ca66b21-2
01:06:25.456 --> 01:06:29.840
One of them has a sign out on
the side of it that says Cafe.

fa06e697-ae08-49ae-8c7d-6585ee8877ab-0
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:35.803
And you can see into those
windows above the front door,

fa06e697-ae08-49ae-8c7d-6585ee8877ab-1
01:06:35.803 --> 01:06:41.029
and it looks like an apartment.
So you can see two people in one

fa06e697-ae08-49ae-8c7d-6585ee8877ab-2
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:46.014

green chair in the window of

fa06e697-ae08-49ae-8c7d-6585ee8877ab-3
01:06:46.014 --> 01:06:51.161
another apartment. And you can
see on the top floor, one of the

fa06e697-ae08-49ae-8c7d-6585ee8877ab-4

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.212
Looks to be dreaming and that
building is orange with yellow

419881e9-22cb-438d-8bd4-6dbfde592c70-1
01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:02.770

205cb95c-05b6-46a3-947a-1e378913b368-0
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:07.330
And there's still the building
with the purple roof.

7a2d8f29-7db7-4bc6-975f-87b722d3f68f-0
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.620
With the small deck.

0546ff3b-c92a-4296-a922-003dda740c57-0

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:47.581
There's another man walking with

right hand he's he's carrying
his bag.

2c4c4d12-e5ae-4469-a048-d65f440e98dc-0
01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:17.654
So now in this picture, things
have gone back to black and

2c4c4d12-e5ae-4469-a048-d65f440e98dc-1
01:08:17.654 --> 01:08:18.550
black and Gray.

5fd7fd8d-693a-41ce-a551-4fcddc1db2d6-0
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:23.796
White, black, and Gray except
for the sky. The sky is a bright

5fd7fd8d-693a-41ce-a551-4fcddc1db2d6-1
01:08:23.796 --> 01:08:26.450
purple, light purple, and dark
purple.

3bb9f406-e02b-4c09-929e-f533fc3d7a93-0
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.538
And now you can see the old man
in the green jacket and the

3bb9f406-e02b-4c09-929e-f533fc3d7a93-1
01:08:32.538 --> 01:08:36.186
orange scarf, and he's now
standing on the corner of

3bb9f406-e02b-4c09-929e-f533fc3d7a93-2
01:08:36.186 --> 01:08:38.870
another building with a for sale
sign.

1d902441-dee5-4183-9d87-3b29a0a2278b-0
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.971
And this building is also kind
of dilapidated, a little bit

1d902441-dee5-4183-9d87-3b29a0a2278b-1
01:08:45.971 --> 01:08:47.510
dilapidated and.

5158f0a5-7bcd-4e03-a299-a3fff89b3f00-0
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:53.444
You can see a cobblestone
sidewalk that leads to the front

5158f0a5-7bcd-4e03-a299-a3fff89b3f00-1
01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:53.730
door.

5996ab68-dc3e-4a14-a7a4-c77ef1622f75-0
01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:59.125
The front door has a number 19
above it, and there's a dog

5996ab68-dc3e-4a14-a7a4-c77ef1622f75-1
01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:04.177
standing right at the bottom of
the steps. And in the windows of

5996ab68-dc3e-4a14-a7a4-c77ef1622f75-2
01:09:04.177 --> 01:09:08.685
these buildings, of this
building, you can see people. So

5996ab68-dc3e-4a14-a7a4-c77ef1622f75-3
01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:13.348
there's a man smoking a pipe in
the first floor window, and

5996ab68-dc3e-4a14-a7a4-c77ef1622f75-4
01:09:13.348 --> 01:09:16.380
above him there's a woman and a
child.

f4d0fb02-1bea-4dc4-830f-2622e7c1d5c1-0
01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:22.340
And they're all looking down
towards the old man, who is a

f4d0fb02-1bea-4dc4-830f-2622e7c1d5c1-1
01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:27.711
holding something in his hand
with a number on it. It looks to

f4d0fb02-1bea-4dc4-830f-2622e7c1d5c1-2
01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:28.820
be maybe #20.

6f9e7fb5-f3f2-4cd5-942e-e48d0359379d-0
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:35.430
OK.

01a76a35-272c-49ee-82e1-3f837ab1c48c-0
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:39.040
Oh, I forgot this picture.

3c28316d-c17e-4b46-9587-797efc0720b5-0
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:44.497
The other picture is also
cobblestone streets with a lot

3c28316d-c17e-4b46-9587-797efc0720b5-1
01:09:44.497 --> 01:09:44.680
of.

3f4896c2-e561-4f05-b6a1-252dcfc1ee33-0
01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:50.855
Two and three story buildings.
Every building, you can see the

3f4896c2-e561-4f05-b6a1-252dcfc1ee33-1
01:09:50.855 --> 01:09:55.780
windows are open and you can see
people in one of them. On the

3f4896c2-e561-4f05-b6a1-252dcfc1ee33-2
01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.236
1st floor it looks to be a
bakery and there's a man in a

3f4896c2-e561-4f05-b6a1-252dcfc1ee33-3
01:10:00.236 --> 01:10:05.083
kitchen. He's got a white apron
and a white beard and a white

3f4896c2-e561-4f05-b6a1-252dcfc1ee33-4
01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:09.070
baker's chef's hat. And outside
the building is a.

bff9f656-8fa0-47ae-ab16-b9f2094f53cc-0
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.140
A car that's parked and there's
a fountain.

75859ed8-9d7b-4b32-8623-dfb79dd1d0bf-0
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:18.800
In the middle of the cobblestone
streets with a dog.

6c9a4601-83a2-4570-be81-b4d7c948370e-0
01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:26.454
And there's a man sitting on the
edge of the fountain who has a

6c9a4601-83a2-4570-be81-b4d7c948370e-1
01:10:26.454 --> 01:10:31.080
long brown beard, and he has a
bottle in his hand.

188282aa-dfba-4cd9-b42d-4be22902ecc1-0
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:34.760
OK.

af86ae3d-3b28-4837-8755-f8e3112da8ac-0
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:42.196
So now we can see just the very
front of one of the buildings,

af86ae3d-3b28-4837-8755-f8e3112da8ac-1
01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:45.670
with three steps leading up to
the front door.

1b4812de-9c82-42cd-913c-0e39abebcdf3-0
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:48.180
And.

fa422099-04e4-42af-96c4-ea91987bc284-0
01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:54.855
Kind of walking past those steps
is the man with the green jacket

fa422099-04e4-42af-96c4-ea91987bc284-1
01:10:54.855 --> 01:10:59.776
and the orange scarf. He's still
carrying his bag and there's a

fa422099-04e4-42af-96c4-ea91987bc284-2
01:10:59.776 --> 01:11:04.774
little dog at walking with him.
And at the top of those steps is

fa422099-04e4-42af-96c4-ea91987bc284-3
01:11:04.774 --> 01:11:07.620
a young girl in a red jumper
with a.

40f46214-00e9-42d7-88d5-4507e859abf6-0
01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.476
Yellowish blouse and she has big
curly brown hair with a ribbon

40f46214-00e9-42d7-88d5-4507e859abf6-1
01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:18.493
holding it back off of her face
and on her shoulder. There's a

40f46214-00e9-42d7-88d5-4507e859abf6-2
01:11:18.493 --> 01:11:23.431
mouse sitting on her shoulder,
and she has a big smile on her

40f46214-00e9-42d7-88d5-4507e859abf6-3
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:28.130
face with freckles, and she's
holding out with both hands,

40f46214-00e9-42d7-88d5-4507e859abf6-4
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:30.360
holding out a purple flower.

b4e2426b-d3db-4335-89c1-9c2e0fb56371-0
01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:36.165
And in the window of the house,
there's a another man leaning on

b4e2426b-d3db-4335-89c1-9c2e0fb56371-1
01:11:36.165 --> 01:11:39.540
the window sill. He's holding a
red flower.

a77f18cf-73e3-4fb1-8945-d6112d394e25-0
01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.414
And he has a white shirt with a
Gray vest and a red bow tie, and

a77f18cf-73e3-4fb1-8945-d6112d394e25-1
01:11:44.414 --> 01:11:48.221
he's wearing glasses with a big
round face and a very nice

a77f18cf-73e3-4fb1-8945-d6112d394e25-2
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.576
smile. And he's looking out
towards the young girl.

a77f18cf-73e3-4fb1-8945-d6112d394e25-3
01:11:51.576 --> 01:11:52.479
#END_flowerman

d67b6c34-5098-4355-b5d3-b31df1e438ec-0
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:55.880
Perfect. OK.

9ba2c6e0-ad5a-4bdd-8f0d-3a8fafd93c7d-0
01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.720
So that's the end of that story
if you wanted to take a.

d9e30cc3-635a-42f9-a846-ae756155f9f6-0
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:07.124
2 to 3 minute break. It's up to
you. Or we could just keep

d9e30cc3-635a-42f9-a846-ae756155f9f6-1
01:12:07.124 --> 01:12:07.480
going.

dacdb46a-bda7-4d69-89ea-922e9cd3e6d3-0
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.010
I'm good as long as I can keep
drinking something. Keep

dacdb46a-bda7-4d69-89ea-922e9cd3e6d3-1
01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:14.470
drinking stuff. Thank you. Yeah,
of course.

3341268d-af48-42ad-b680-17f4da0c4cdd-0
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.208
OK, now let me pull up the next
one. I'm going to share my

3341268d-af48-42ad-b680-17f4da0c4cdd-1
01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:22.090
screen. This is also a story.

6406f820-9ebd-42fb-adfa-0a1f74910b42-0
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:31.351
Like I said before, just take
between 10 to 15 minutes. This

6406f820-9ebd-42fb-adfa-0a1f74910b42-1
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:38.160
one's 20 slides, so you could
tell me when to flip and let me.

36e497ca-e45a-4d5e-975f-5083f891b6da-0
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.760
Is that OK? So whenever you're
ready.

34b994ea-3df8-4bf1-91c5-5d6000e152d5-0
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.610
OK, the story starts by.

f859cf05-db27-415e-bcf2-fd57a8ca6e46-0
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.751
#START_quest Looking looks like
we're in a park, maybe with a

f859cf05-db27-415e-bcf2-fd57a8ca6e46-1
01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:03.498
park bench, and there's a street
light next to it, and then

f859cf05-db27-415e-bcf2-fd57a8ca6e46-2
01:13:03.498 --> 01:13:05.310
there's a wall with a winged.

96a77f8d-c3f7-4655-85c3-4e805a6e7c1b-0
01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.970
Warrior of some sort.

4abf0b1b-d93d-408d-8f04-0cd9d7e67999-0
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:16.797
Standing on the on the edge of
it, and he's holding something

4abf0b1b-d93d-408d-8f04-0cd9d7e67999-1
01:13:16.797 --> 01:13:17.730
in his hands.

6c99f8d5-125a-40d3-9d1b-7c71d77b2280-0
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:21.320
At the.

98eb1e39-c879-47c2-855a-6d34b6ccec13-0
01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:27.180
Behind there is a large archway.

a94dfc73-0072-4428-8ce3-37a25932052b-0
01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.330
And under that Archway being
protected by the rain.

c688a84c-623e-4759-98e8-eb183620407a-0
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.920
Is a little girl.

b40f1716-291b-4e69-9fdd-e135b2daad3d-0
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.600
And a little boy.

33fc1aa5-75eb-4b62-bf15-769d21871ff4-0
01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:40.261
And the little girl is the one
with the red pen. She's got

33fc1aa5-75eb-4b62-bf15-769d21871ff4-1
01:13:40.261 --> 01:13:44.055
brown hair and a white shirt.
She's wearing shorts. And she's

33fc1aa5-75eb-4b62-bf15-769d21871ff4-2
01:13:44.055 --> 01:13:46.810
with the little boy that has the
purple pen.

Dark shorts.

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:57.780
And sitting on his shoulder is
the purple bird.

35f1c639-1d79-45cf-ae7e-d4cdaea66107-0
01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:05.168
You can also see a 2 wheeled
bicycle that they must have

35f1c639-1d79-45cf-ae7e-d4cdaea66107-1
01:14:05.168 --> 01:14:09.918

purple and the back wheel is

red.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.791
So you can see the little girl
in the little little boy along

2255c7b4-1712-4411-8548-6ea4d7d679e3-1
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.500

Castle or a palace.

38ad5f0d-b422-447b-a24e-0a8c7cc89760-0
01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:36.798
And the front doors are open and
there's a king who has come out

38ad5f0d-b422-447b-a24e-0a8c7cc89760-1
01:14:36.798 --> 01:14:40.840
the front door and he's got a
long orange.

Robe on with a brown cloak over
the top of that and something

He's got an orange crown on.

eacefbd8-c5e8-41bc-a6c9-45e8e6801fac-0
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:05.099

piece of paper that looks to

eacefbd8-c5e8-41bc-a6c9-45e8e6801fac-2
01:15:11.047 --> 01:15:11.559
have.

c5e1889a-75a7-4f04-8d4e-8e26c838c593-0
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:16.850
Double circle drawn on it and
along the circles are.

4f165826-a7c8-4e8f-809a-4c3dcbdf8a66-0
01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:23.300
Are other circles drawn and they
are all in different colors.

4f165826-a7c8-4e8f-809a-4c3dcbdf8a66-1
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.890
He's holding either a flashlight
or a orange pen.

f133cbda-08d4-41a1-ae6a-86d92e8f02ae-0
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.120
So you can see the.

6c7e5e34-1da4-4017-b89b-45104607c80c-0
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:39.850
Uh, King has now taken off the
how to describe the.

f010bc2f-6b52-48ce-bf5b-9d14137c77a4-0
01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:40.990
The.

5ba0ca2a-45a2-458f-bf28-8cf460bb3ab3-0
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:47.335
What he had across his shoulder
and the cross the front of him

5ba0ca2a-45a2-458f-bf28-8cf460bb3ab3-1
01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:50.949
looks like maybe it holds
ammunition. He's taken that off

5ba0ca2a-45a2-458f-bf28-8cf460bb3ab3-2
01:15:50.949 --> 01:15:54.812
and he's put it on the little
girl. The little girl still has

5ba0ca2a-45a2-458f-bf28-8cf460bb3ab3-3
01:15:54.812 --> 01:15:55.560
her red pen.

a3d6b5c8-20ba-4a63-a5fc-0f60387c8a27-0
01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:01.420
The the King is pointing to
something and the little boy is

a3d6b5c8-20ba-4a63-a5fc-0f60387c8a27-1
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.966
standing there and he has the
paper in his right hand now, the

a3d6b5c8-20ba-4a63-a5fc-0f60387c8a27-2
01:16:05.966 --> 01:16:10.513
paper that had the circles drawn
on it. The little boy has his

a3d6b5c8-20ba-4a63-a5fc-0f60387c8a27-3
01:16:10.513 --> 01:16:14.771
purple pen and the purple bird
is sitting on his shoulder.

a3d6b5c8-20ba-4a63-a5fc-0f60387c8a27-4
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:18.380
They're standing in front of the
open front door.

7b5c2af8-7cee-400c-b889-2e338d4c6b74-0
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:26.122
Now you can see coming out of
that door are two guards and

7b5c2af8-7cee-400c-b889-2e338d4c6b74-1
01:16:26.122 --> 01:16:32.019
they have their Spears with them
that look like large arrows and

7b5c2af8-7cee-400c-b889-2e338d4c6b74-2
01:16:32.019 --> 01:16:37.735
they are in in silver armor and
they've grabbed the arm of the

7b5c2af8-7cee-400c-b889-2e338d4c6b74-3
01:16:37.735 --> 01:16:43.451
king and when they did that the
his orange Pen went flying out

7b5c2af8-7cee-400c-b889-2e338d4c6b74-4
01:16:43.451 --> 01:16:44.540
of his hand.

da856d01-0a37-4fff-8319-a6c7ab5b2e3c-0
01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:49.064
And the little girl and the
little boy are standing next to

da856d01-0a37-4fff-8319-a6c7ab5b2e3c-1
01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:52.951
him and are very startled. And
the little girl has the red pen,

da856d01-0a37-4fff-8319-a6c7ab5b2e3c-2
01:16:52.951 --> 01:16:56.717
and the boy has his paper with
the Purple Pen. And the purple

da856d01-0a37-4fff-8319-a6c7ab5b2e3c-3
01:16:56.717 --> 01:17:00.544
bird is flying above them. And
now the guards are marching the

da856d01-0a37-4fff-8319-a6c7ab5b2e3c-4
01:17:00.544 --> 01:17:03.460
king into the open, back into
the open doorway.

b855eb0c-320c-4ee1-ae0b-35f26c907c9a-0
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:12.624
And now you can see the little
boy and the little girl are

b855eb0c-320c-4ee1-ae0b-35f26c907c9a-1
01:17:12.624 --> 01:17:16.696
standing outside the door, but
the double doors are now closed.

b855eb0c-320c-4ee1-ae0b-35f26c907c9a-2
01:17:16.696 --> 01:17:20.451
The little boy has his purple
pen in his left hand and the

b855eb0c-320c-4ee1-ae0b-35f26c907c9a-3
01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:24.332
rolled up paper in his right
hand, and the purple bird is on

b855eb0c-320c-4ee1-ae0b-35f26c907c9a-4
01:17:24.332 --> 01:17:25.160
his shoulder.

c976fc71-c248-4ccc-ba2d-026c9a28cf06-0
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.850
The little girl.

137f8388-3047-4b34-8d42-eaadba53de42-0
01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:32.710
still has her red pen in her
right hand. She has that.

920ad4c0-1240-4c7c-aa88-8a19e7c684fd-0
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:39.437
Banner belt across her shoulder,
and in one of the slots she's

920ad4c0-1240-4c7c-aa88-8a19e7c684fd-1
01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:42.990
putting her oran, putting the
King's Orange Pen.

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-0
01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:50.541
You can see outside the closed
doors, the little girl has taken

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-1
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:54.936
the Red pen and she's drawing
something on the wall, and the

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-2
01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:59.115
little boy is kneeled down on
the ground and he's drawing

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-3
01:17:59.115 --> 01:18:03.510
something with his purple pen.
And the purple bird is flying

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-4
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:07.689
above them. They finished
drawing and the little girl has

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-5
01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:12.156
drawn a red key and the little
boy has drawn a purple key and

3e24189f-3140-4a78-853f-7cd0b4ad46d8-6
01:18:12.156 --> 01:18:14.389
they're holding them up to one.

e55223d3-c87a-4d03-987c-36c594294cb1-0
01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:14.830
Another.

4c4707d5-f018-4de1-b741-f35d6569c097-0
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.405
So they've put them in the front
doors, the red pen and the right

4c4707d5-f018-4de1-b741-f35d6569c097-1
01:18:19.405 --> 01:18:23.193
door, and the purple pen and the
sorry, the red pen in the left

4c4707d5-f018-4de1-b741-f35d6569c097-2
01:18:23.193 --> 01:18:26.862
door and the purple pen in the
right door, and they've opened

4c4707d5-f018-4de1-b741-f35d6569c097-3
01:18:26.862 --> 01:18:30.532
and unlocked those doors, and
they're running inside with the

4c4707d5-f018-4de1-b741-f35d6569c097-4
01:18:30.532 --> 01:18:32.130
purple bird following them.

e58c2e95-fa61-45cd-bc6e-3df7a77aa6b4-0
01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:44.790
So now you can see outside the
large castle.

43be1b44-988f-42e5-8cae-47aad7fae8bd-0
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:50.332
The castle's grey but has a lot
of towers and turrets on it that

43be1b44-988f-42e5-8cae-47aad7fae8bd-1
01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:51.530
have purple roofs.

358775c9-40d4-40e3-9bbf-e7c8c246cfd0-0
01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:55.520
Some of the domed Dome.

4529b26b-f390-4119-8b73-8189224b8d36-0
01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:02.351
Domes have gold covering on
them. You can see water or a

4529b26b-f390-4119-8b73-8189224b8d36-1
01:19:02.351 --> 01:19:05.450
Moat outside this cal castle.

4595a04a-0d3b-41b6-b80d-dfb346377b32-0
01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.210
With a paddle boat.

308ea8af-e686-4b03-a73e-907e5ad9e5b3-0
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:15.790
Full of people that's paddling
in the water and on the boat you

308ea8af-e686-4b03-a73e-907e5ad9e5b3-1
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:16.520
can see.

59326d79-b570-465c-b6fc-2ab5423523be-0
01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:22.419
Some of the guards with the
wearing their armor and with

59326d79-b570-465c-b6fc-2ab5423523be-1
01:19:22.419 --> 01:19:26.900
their Spears and you can see the
king is on the the paddle boat.

465dd239-5a1d-463d-8cfe-0f8398cc1426-0
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:33.148
And the paddle boat is going
through the water under a large

465dd239-5a1d-463d-8cfe-0f8398cc1426-1
01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:36.470
archway that above it has a
bridge.

8e47e0f1-0f26-4333-a538-dad253833568-0
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.730
Over on the other side of the
water under a small waterfall.

8a86b8a8-9851-4000-9f4a-559c08194173-0
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:45.626
And a rock formation. You can
see the little boy and the

8a86b8a8-9851-4000-9f4a-559c08194173-1
01:19:45.626 --> 01:19:49.834
little girl and the purple bird
are hiding, watching what's

8a86b8a8-9851-4000-9f4a-559c08194173-2
01:19:49.834 --> 01:19:53.270
happening with the with the
boat, with the king.

6f06b289-cf13-4a88-982e-bf620b6d5034-0
01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.320
OK.

3bebaf4a-f5b9-458a-821c-4f3d8fda8bf5-0
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:08.308
So now you can still see the
castle with the gold domes and

3bebaf4a-f5b9-458a-821c-4f3d8fda8bf5-1
01:20:08.308 --> 01:20:12.946
the blue roofs and the large
archway that has a bridge across

3bebaf4a-f5b9-458a-821c-4f3d8fda8bf5-2
01:20:12.946 --> 01:20:17.209
the top. The bridge across the
top must have water on it

3bebaf4a-f5b9-458a-821c-4f3d8fda8bf5-3
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:20.950
because there are boats floating
into the castle.

bc7c5728-a043-46d9-b005-cfd7ec4b6db7-0
01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.521
And under the archway is where
you can still see the large

bc7c5728-a043-46d9-b005-cfd7ec4b6db7-1
01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:26.250
paddle boat.

1d04848c-d0b6-4aa2-a733-dc343a9e6531-0
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:27.500
Umm.

82b623aa-0c7d-4b1a-8bec-7d98f134f23c-0
01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:30.140
Going under the archway.

c32dbbf0-b2ac-43f4-95a9-588ab006b853-0
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:35.040
And that's the boat that has the
king on it. You can see the

c32dbbf0-b2ac-43f4-95a9-588ab006b853-1
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.240
castle domes with the gold domes
and the blue roofs, and it

c32dbbf0-b2ac-43f4-95a9-588ab006b853-2
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.230
actually looks like some of the
towers might be on fire.

b85ba80c-2e09-464e-98af-6cba9c6fe3b2-0
01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:49.325
Down by the rock formation under
the waterfall is where you can

b85ba80c-2e09-464e-98af-6cba9c6fe3b2-1
01:20:49.325 --> 01:20:53.518
still see the little boy and the
little girl and the purple bird.

b85ba80c-2e09-464e-98af-6cba9c6fe3b2-2
01:20:53.518 --> 01:20:57.583
And they're now looking at that
map or that piece of paper that

b85ba80c-2e09-464e-98af-6cba9c6fe3b2-3
01:20:57.583 --> 01:21:01.586
had all the circles drawn on it,
the little girl's pointing to

b85ba80c-2e09-464e-98af-6cba9c6fe3b2-4
01:21:01.586 --> 01:21:05.080
one of the one of the circles.
So there are two large.

aab28060-c142-44d4-84f5-84d8f72edf16-0
01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:13.310
um there there's a large circle
with rainbow colors and then in.

ab29bc4a-74c9-45cf-ae69-23f0e9a3cb42-0
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.316
Place along the large circle are
smaller circles with pictures in

ab29bc4a-74c9-45cf-ae69-23f0e9a3cb42-1
01:21:20.316 --> 01:21:24.410
them. There's 123456 smaller
circles with pictures.

403529bb-4676-4400-8222-30c0ddf12cad-0
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:29.050
The first picture they're
pointing to looks to be under

403529bb-4676-4400-8222-30c0ddf12cad-1
01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:33.132
water, but it looks like a
building with columns and. But

403529bb-4676-4400-8222-30c0ddf12cad-2
01:21:33.132 --> 01:21:37.002
it looks like there's fish
floating around and they're

403529bb-4676-4400-8222-30c0ddf12cad-3
01:21:37.002 --> 01:21:38.480
pointing to that one.

064f042f-db0e-4984-9b09-573d4f83d91f-0
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:49.741
So now you can still see the
little boy and the little girl

064f042f-db0e-4984-9b09-573d4f83d91f-1
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:52.560
are crouched down by the rock
formation under the waterfall.

156a77c3-0e99-439b-bd8d-b9b216ec1169-0
01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:58.102
And they still have their map
with them and the purple bird,

156a77c3-0e99-439b-bd8d-b9b216ec1169-1
01:21:58.102 --> 01:21:59.430
but in the water.

691ab894-c92d-4deb-aa80-92da2c25f3e7-0
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.860
are three boats with.

08e993a4-aa00-44b9-9036-cb589d8b4362-0
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:10.310
With guards, guards in them and
the.

46feaad1-54f5-40ae-9667-6b744b1991ba-0
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.525
The boats are getting closer to
the to the two children and in

46feaad1-54f5-40ae-9667-6b744b1991ba-1
01:22:15.525 --> 01:22:17.590
one of the boats you can see.

f5cb99c7-ba83-4cab-943d-8076c6fcf41a-0
01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:24.792
One of the guards is holding a
gold birdcage and standing next

f5cb99c7-ba83-4cab-943d-8076c6fcf41a-1
01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:30.354
to him is a man that has a has
gold on his clothing as well as

f5cb99c7-ba83-4cab-943d-8076c6fcf41a-2
01:22:30.354 --> 01:22:34.680
his his hat. Behind them you can
see the castle.

7ee4a0a8-c100-4cb3-b27f-4c572c652722-0
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.660
And it still looks like towers
on the castle are on fire.

7bd7b811-4e4c-49a5-b6ba-6655c969543a-0
01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:45.730
Now you can see the boy and the
girl on the rock formation, and

7bd7b811-4e4c-49a5-b6ba-6655c969543a-1
01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:49.330
the girl has her red pen and the
boy has his purple pen and

7bd7b811-4e4c-49a5-b6ba-6655c969543a-2
01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:51.190
they're each drawing something.

f8bdf5a7-bafe-4afa-856f-306e5aa6b8c6-0
01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.990
The little girl has drawn red
flippers.

6ec2eed2-f90e-40f4-abc8-fd7ffa6b86e3-0
01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:58.690
And.

a5f665dc-400b-40bd-8a10-4be7e0978200-0
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.870
The.

c27ac0a9-2263-4a19-8960-242635238b44-0
01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:09.220
Something else she's also drawn
a red circle with red circles on

c27ac0a9-2263-4a19-8960-242635238b44-1
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:14.137
it that I don't know what it is
yet, and the boy has has the

c27ac0a9-2263-4a19-8960-242635238b44-2
01:23:14.137 --> 01:23:18.329
purple bird sitting on his
shoulder and he's drawn.

1bd1a630-4f76-4776-b6af-ce44e0f973e5-0
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.620
Large purple.

55cf65e0-19fb-411e-81ed-1ac05a3a7a4f-0
01:23:24.150 --> 01:23:28.570
And tentacles of a octopus
coming up out of the water.

07c64cbc-b807-4211-9aa4-e57173909a94-0
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:33.648
And now the two kids have their
red flippers on and they've

07c64cbc-b807-4211-9aa4-e57173909a94-1
01:23:33.648 --> 01:23:35.170
jumped into the water.

90d7f332-c772-4936-8b45-6d1c1953362b-0
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:47.688
Now you can see under the water
and you can see the red octopus

90d7f332-c772-4936-8b45-6d1c1953362b-1
01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:53.415
that the boy has drawn. And the
two kids have their red flippers

90d7f332-c772-4936-8b45-6d1c1953362b-2
01:23:53.415 --> 01:23:58.789
on them and they have red scuba
tanks on their backs and red

90d7f332-c772-4936-8b45-6d1c1953362b-3
01:23:58.789 --> 01:24:04.515
scuba helmets on. The boy still
has his map wrapped up or rolled

90d7f332-c772-4936-8b45-6d1c1953362b-4
01:24:04.515 --> 01:24:08.040
up in his hand. You can see the
purple.

be1cd2fc-7fd9-46b4-b18b-d84c1cd94bc2-0
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.160
bird and the Purple Bird has a
scuba tank.

7f688afa-abf1-4dcd-92a3-a6b1223c8a18-0
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.420
On him also.

5d212ac5-e201-4efc-84d0-315598fbbf6f-0
01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.850
They are grasping onto the
tentacles of the purple octopus.

6e63125c-97c8-4b50-90bb-4059b035c5bb-0
01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:25.012
And the purple octopus is going
towards a building that's under

6e63125c-97c8-4b50-90bb-4059b035c5bb-1
01:24:25.012 --> 01:24:25.580
the water.

b3ccdfdc-f0fc-4cec-a9ee-610c4cef20e9-0
01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.940
That looks to be.

eda9b482-7f08-44a9-bcc7-52c106d87a84-0
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:32.655
Umm, it It's the building that
we saw in the picture that was

eda9b482-7f08-44a9-bcc7-52c106d87a84-1
01:24:32.655 --> 01:24:36.530
in the circle that that they
were drawing at drawing pointing

eda9b482-7f08-44a9-bcc7-52c106d87a84-2
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.530
to on their map.

af1afb18-a601-450a-8739-fbfc04f93520-0
01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:40.480
And this building is.

599bf821-5f9b-43cb-a29a-927d5d83246e-0
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.972
Has large columns and is lit up
somehow underwater. There's

599bf821-5f9b-43cb-a29a-927d5d83246e-1
01:24:46.972 --> 01:24:49.610
towers around this building.

0904cac6-edf9-4bb4-8d71-e357b6cf97d8-0
01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:54.720
On top of one of the towers is a
mermaid.

b18bc24f-94ce-411d-a140-56538c2ad65e-0
01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:02.373
And around all of that it looks
to be like a Colosseum or large

b18bc24f-94ce-411d-a140-56538c2ad65e-1
01:25:02.373 --> 01:25:08.360
archways around it. And there
are fish, fish in the water.

3b2eba78-eaa6-4c3d-b4f3-870bc034f9de-0
01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:20.898
So now the two kids have gotten
down to the bottom where they're

3b2eba78-eaa6-4c3d-b4f3-870bc034f9de-1
01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:25.941
at the building with the
columns, and in the middle of

3b2eba78-eaa6-4c3d-b4f3-870bc034f9de-2
01:25:25.941 --> 01:25:31.533
that building is a statue with
seahorses, and on top of that

3b2eba78-eaa6-4c3d-b4f3-870bc034f9de-3
01:25:31.533 --> 01:25:32.450
statue is.

fc86cd2e-60b6-40ab-be73-a0fd3472ae3b-0
01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:36.490
Maybe a large open seashell?

6a05eafa-32b5-4e70-aa88-c0fc11268a6b-0
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:41.312
And the little boy and the
little girl still have their red

6a05eafa-32b5-4e70-aa88-c0fc11268a6b-1
01:25:41.312 --> 01:25:45.454
flippers on and their red scuba
tanks and red scuba helmets. And

6a05eafa-32b5-4e70-aa88-c0fc11268a6b-2
01:25:45.454 --> 01:25:48.640
the purple bird is there with
the red scuba tank.

1fde32e5-2f75-43df-8462-3a295f36e6e8-0
01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:58.130
Now you can see in the water the
kids are hanging on to the.

0e3a0718-4715-4c6b-9a1b-428fed78d54b-0
01:25:59.950 --> 01:26:04.677
Purple octopus, and they have
the map in their hand and the

0e3a0718-4715-4c6b-9a1b-428fed78d54b-1
01:26:04.677 --> 01:26:09.562
little girl has the like belt
across her and she's got all of

0e3a0718-4715-4c6b-9a1b-428fed78d54b-2
01:26:09.562 --> 01:26:14.605
the pens. She's got the red pen,
orange pen and purple pen. And

0e3a0718-4715-4c6b-9a1b-428fed78d54b-3
01:26:14.605 --> 01:26:19.648
they're now being chased in the
water by the guards, led by the

0e3a0718-4715-4c6b-9a1b-428fed78d54b-4
01:26:19.648 --> 01:26:24.612
one guard with the gold on him,
and he has gold flippers and a

0e3a0718-4715-4c6b-9a1b-428fed78d54b-5
01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:25.400
gold gold.

e935bc33-6a6d-475d-985f-578326e580a9-0
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.410
Spear and.

1dd90c78-a44d-403a-8f70-715bea6a7883-0
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:33.020
Behind him are 4-5 more guards.

b2f427b8-8d37-4ae3-aa62-0b2c6491f53e-0
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.042
The kids have now gotten to some
land and they're coming up out

b2f427b8-8d37-4ae3-aa62-0b2c6491f53e-1
01:26:44.042 --> 01:26:47.290
of the water, the little girl's
taking off her scuba gear.

8a450be0-f716-4496-8454-78708067d80d-0
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.725
The little boy is just coming up
out of the water with his red

8a450be0-f716-4496-8454-78708067d80d-1
01:26:52.725 --> 01:26:56.891
scuba gear still on, but he's
grabbing the purple pen from the

8a450be0-f716-4496-8454-78708067d80d-2
01:26:56.891 --> 01:27:00.924
little girl. Above them is the
purple bird flying and on the

8a450be0-f716-4496-8454-78708067d80d-3
01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:05.090
land it are a lot of palm trees.
Way behind the palm trees you

8a450be0-f716-4496-8454-78708067d80d-4
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:08.000
can see a mountain range in the
background.

ee355bdc-8a7b-4ce9-a447-c2ef2055af2d-0
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:13.669
Now you can see the little boy
and the little girl are drawing

ee355bdc-8a7b-4ce9-a447-c2ef2055af2d-1
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:18.468
something. The little girl has
her red pen and the boy has the

ee355bdc-8a7b-4ce9-a447-c2ef2055af2d-2
01:27:18.468 --> 01:27:23.115
purple pen. The Purple bird is
on the shoulder of the little

ee355bdc-8a7b-4ce9-a447-c2ef2055af2d-3
01:27:23.115 --> 01:27:23.420
boy.

b61edaed-500e-4885-93f8-651b0cf27a52-0
01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:30.790
So what they have drawn is a
purple rhinoceros.

77105d87-23a5-49e3-93db-dd687335d0ab-0
01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.540
And on top of the purple
rhinoceros is a red.

6b782418-854e-409d-863f-af96406bac51-0
01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:39.780
Red.

e488648a-54b8-4cf2-820d-c02f127e44f1-0
01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.810
Blanket over the top of the
rhinoceros and the little boy

e488648a-54b8-4cf2-820d-c02f127e44f1-1
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:48.633
and the little girl are sitting
on that blanket and above them

e488648a-54b8-4cf2-820d-c02f127e44f1-2
01:27:48.633 --> 01:27:49.180
is a red.

7ae3bfaa-f4d4-4881-b1bc-d7866bdd17d1-0
01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:50.970
Umm.

89ba4c00-5eed-478d-b6e5-85d98540ef7a-0
01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:53.380
Canopy.

50ed293f-0a46-47e6-ad38-0aa33efd847d-0
01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.700
I can't think of the word.

71ae6696-b277-4af5-bc7f-cbbf884b8b09-0
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:02.620
And the purple bird is flying
along with them. They're headed

71ae6696-b277-4af5-bc7f-cbbf884b8b09-1
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:07.068
towards something that looks
kind of like a pyramid building

71ae6696-b277-4af5-bc7f-cbbf884b8b09-2
01:28:07.068 --> 01:28:09.619
built on the side of the
hillside.

d6461704-64ee-4421-a0dc-2ad4ce5ec942-0
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.825
In the larger picture you can
see part of the pyramid looking

d6461704-64ee-4421-a0dc-2ad4ce5ec942-1
01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:17.630
buildings.

732e841c-02ce-4dd2-9a9f-e0a8a0a7b71a-0
01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:25.073
And the hillside with a lot of
palm trees on it and a very

732e841c-02ce-4dd2-9a9f-e0a8a0a7b71a-1
01:28:25.073 --> 01:28:25.620
tall.

b482bf19-abcc-4546-9228-5ab496359199-0
01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:27.490
Cliff.

92ae3c15-321a-4c4d-ac65-35d257bf2b23-0
01:28:28.210 --> 01:28:34.966
Maybe that has a dilapidated
rope bridge leading out into the

92ae3c15-321a-4c4d-ac65-35d257bf2b23-1
01:28:34.966 --> 01:28:35.620
water.

00fd2047-91fc-4eb0-bf91-3fc480a4a6e1-0
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:38.200
Toward to a building.

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-0
01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:47.808
Now there's a close up of the
cliffside on one side and the

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-1
01:28:47.808 --> 01:28:52.354
and the building that's out in
the water on the right side and

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-2
01:28:52.354 --> 01:28:56.827
the rope bridge is leading from
one side to the other. And on

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-3
01:28:56.827 --> 01:29:01.444
that rope bridge you can see the
little boy and the little girl

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-4
01:29:01.444 --> 01:29:05.340
are are running across the
bridge. The Purple bird is

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-5
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:09.524
flying above them and they're
headed towards the building

45942c05-aee8-465e-8b04-20429e10665b-6
01:29:09.524 --> 01:29:10.030

01:33:15.810 --> 01:33:20.591
fist at something. You can see
another blimp with two guards

f1057586-d632-4beb-b2e9-16e4e1caf879-2
01:33:20.591 --> 01:33:25.529
who are hanging off the edge of
the blimp, and they've dropped

f1057586-d632-4beb-b2e9-16e4e1caf879-3
01:33:25.529 --> 01:33:26.470
their spear.

55357d08-6cb7-4fac-979c-ebaefd9441f4-0
01:33:27.710 --> 01:33:30.919
Between the little boy and the
little girl from that bright

55357d08-6cb7-4fac-979c-ebaefd9441f4-1
01:33:30.919 --> 01:33:31.240
light.

01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:37.579
Is a rainbow of red and yellow

c12d5707-d33c-4be5-9d1e-4c50d3e669a5-1
01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:42.684
that Rainbow was is leading up
to the belt that had all the

c12d5707-d33c-4be5-9d1e-4c50d3e669a5-2
01:33:42.684 --> 01:33:47.789
different colored pins in it,
the belt that the little girl

c12d5707-d33c-4be5-9d1e-4c50d3e669a5-3
01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:48.810
was wearing.

01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:52.730
And the belt is being carried
and flown away by the Purple

4f0496ae-66fa-4654-9467-800c50314448-1
01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:53.000
bird.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.153
And as it's flying away, all of
those pens are drawing this

29910b97-d264-406a-9882-f28a268b1755-1
01:33:58.153 --> 01:34:02.030
rainbow down to the little boy
and the little girl.

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.195
The rainbow must be super bright
because some of the guards are

a0c93b94-69e5-43cb-b51c-8cbbfd742ba1-1
01:34:08.195 --> 01:34:11.190

their hand.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:18.090
Including the guard that has the
Gold bird cage.

01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:25.430
So now we're.

29cde067-4ee4-4a56-8ab5-2c4f178581f3-0
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:33.122
Back at the castle and you can
see way in the distance on the

29cde067-4ee4-4a56-8ab5-2c4f178581f3-1
01:34:33.122 --> 01:34:38.814
top of that mountain is where
the rainbow is coming from, and

29cde067-4ee4-4a56-8ab5-2c4f178581f3-2
01:34:38.814 --> 01:34:44.414
that's probably where the little
boy and the little girl are

29cde067-4ee4-4a56-8ab5-2c4f178581f3-3
01:34:44.414 --> 01:34:50.198
standing. And that rainbow has
come up in the sky and has come

29cde067-4ee4-4a56-8ab5-2c4f178581f3-4
01:34:50.198 --> 01:34:51.299
down to the.

3b87c100-e237-4081-891c-60e9cb00703f-0
01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:56.669
The boat, the paddle boat that
is in the water outside the

3b87c100-e237-4081-891c-60e9cb00703f-1
01:34:56.669 --> 01:35:01.387
castle, and this is the boat
that has the king on it and that

3b87c100-e237-4081-891c-60e9cb00703f-2
01:35:01.387 --> 01:35:05.952
rainbow has come down right into
that boat. You can see the

3b87c100-e237-4081-891c-60e9cb00703f-3
01:35:05.952 --> 01:35:10.290
purple bird with the belt and
all the different colored.

435ae54b-7e01-4514-a161-46441abeed32-0
01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:15.652
Pens is the flying there. He's
drawn that rainbow straight into

435ae54b-7e01-4514-a161-46441abeed32-1
01:35:15.652 --> 01:35:18.820
the boat, so it's blinding some
of the guards.

4a57590f-2436-4b9c-985e-b48dfd81ae53-0
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:23.760
Some of the cards have fallen
over the side of the boat.

a8a5e838-28db-474b-9329-5398cea02a36-0
01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:28.944
And the king is standing on the
very back with his hands up in

a8a5e838-28db-474b-9329-5398cea02a36-1
01:35:28.944 --> 01:35:32.615
the in the in the air, looking
towards the other end of the

a8a5e838-28db-474b-9329-5398cea02a36-2
01:35:32.615 --> 01:35:35.920
rainbow where the little boy and
the little girl are.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.360
So now everything's becoming
much more colorful instead of

4e9154eb-c647-4582-a844-c51502d26b9a-1
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.880
just Gray and dull.

de03277e-7e96-41da-9e34-2aea3a042757-0
01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:54.540
You can see the castle, which is
all lit up with color.

147b645b-27cb-4ebb-881c-a4574b5e874c-0
01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.540
With the rainbow behind it from
one side to the other.

05c5cbb2-69f6-4d51-a9c5-d9192b8d570e-0
01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:05.528
You can see the water bridge
leading from the archway on one

05c5cbb2-69f6-4d51-a9c5-d9192b8d570e-1
01:36:05.528 --> 01:36:07.840
side to the archway on another.

419960b0-9fae-434f-9b91-480fd27d6416-0
01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:15.230
And in that water bridge are
some boats with gondoliers.

a8c73bc6-aba4-4231-827a-07d57de29cb2-0
01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:16.810
And.

81e9552f-804d-4946-8bf1-bbb611a55694-0
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:22.406
Out of coming up out of the
water are purple tentacles from

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:33.080
There's a boat with a band
playing music with drum and tuba

4a0d929e-b571-48f6-8353-740c6dbf0933-1
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:34.740

01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:41.670
And you can see the back end of
the large paddle boat.

ee4a873b-fb70-47ac-833f-caa14a3eacf5-0
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:47.200
And on the top of the paddle
boat is our purple rhinoceros.

9e3e850b-25fe-45c7-b3b7-d7e06cba38fb-0
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.601
With the red blanket over the
top and the red canopy, and

9e3e850b-25fe-45c7-b3b7-d7e06cba38fb-1
01:36:52.601 --> 01:36:57.086
sitting under the canopy are the
little boy and the little girl,

9e3e850b-25fe-45c7-b3b7-d7e06cba38fb-2
01:36:57.086 --> 01:37:00.260
and in front of them is the king
and they're.

1ca929f2-a71f-42fa-aad6-9e4edd53bf90-0
01:37:01.110 --> 01:37:06.470
Waving to other people, there
are people that you can see.

cb5af615-326c-4422-9dab-6443be3f0b79-0
01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.500
In the castle.

01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:25.359
So the paddle boat has come to
the rock formation that's under

bba5596b-134e-4297-8c1a-721bc9bae929-1
01:37:25.359 --> 01:37:26.430
the waterfall.

01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:32.185
And the little boy has gotten
off the paddle boat, down some

5a75f84a-6a54-4c22-a18a-87f5c61f11e9-1
01:37:32.185 --> 01:37:37.096

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.700
And he's reaching out his hand
to the little girl to help her

255f3ffc-d902-4bf8-86f2-46c8a8e3bdd3-1
01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:51.040
get down off of the the purple
rhinoceros in the water by the

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.770
You can see the tentacles of the
purple octopus.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:08.540
And the rainbow is still in the
sky with the purple dragonfly.

cf0e6a6d-2e33-482e-9e85-f3b935e64453-0
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:16.316
On the large rock formation
above the waterfall you can see

e3bba1c7-5b4e-4aef-905f-5df2f67e2eac-0
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:58.363
He's placing the crown on the
boy's head while the boy is

e3bba1c7-5b4e-4aef-905f-5df2f67e2eac-1

125b009d-a561-48ef-9bba-30eb3cdfdea6-0

You don't even know where to
start.

aca4b31d-c36c-4d98-8966-a886d6ad2466-0
01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:39.050

01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:34.215
Let's see, there's also a red
dinosaur that must be a costume

0d3f292e-c979-486a-a0ca-8bf21a7e7067-1
01:49:34.215 --> 01:49:36.850
because out of the top of the.

01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:42.976
Where the head would be of the
dinosaur, the head is off and

ee4fd046-daa8-4552-a699-491d392a5e03-1
01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:46.930

01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:32.432
Cavemen just lounging. So

Like theater lights that are
blue and they're pointed towards

2b173ffe-19c4-461c-833e-b9395e486ded-1
01:50:53.148 --> 01:50:54.160

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:21.660
#START_arrival_6 OK, we start
out by seeing a pot or a vase.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.970
Sitting on a table.

01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.290
Maybe an open window or a
mirror?

eec0e50f-fdab-4e64-9617-be1bb7b949a1-0
01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:33.598
And flying down to the edge of
the pot is a little flying

eec0e50f-fdab-4e64-9617-be1bb7b949a1-1
01:53:33.598 --> 01:53:37.105
insect. He's got something in
his mouth and he's dropping that

eec0e50f-fdab-4e64-9617-be1bb7b949a1-2
01:53:37.105 --> 01:53:37.940

01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:45.232
Not sure which direction it goes
here, let's go here. So now

6c9dbef5-ff1f-409b-bd1d-7d9e199cf35b-1
01:53:45.232 --> 01:53:49.758
we've gone back a little bit and
you can still see the pot on the

6c9dbef5-ff1f-409b-bd1d-7d9e199cf35b-2
01:53:49.758 --> 01:53:50.650

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:55.992
And it's a mirror that's on the
wall. And reflected in the

2880d557-ed6c-4b4d-b470-8cf33b76261c-1
01:53:55.992 --> 01:53:59.310
mirror you can see an oil lamp
that's lit.

01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:05.213
And there's a person sitting at
the table. He has a paper and an

a11450e0-dd38-4c06-9ee6-5c9a820c1f22-1
01:54:05.213 --> 01:54:06.750
ink pen in his hand.

01:54:08.170 --> 01:54:11.760
He's writing something on the
paper with the ink pen.

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.580
And some.

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:20.320
Maybe money sitting on the table
in front of him?

d773ca5c-17ce-44c4-ab1a-9fcf23fc8e04-0
01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:25.384
He's now finished writing on the
paper and he's folding it and

d773ca5c-17ce-44c4-ab1a-9fcf23fc8e04-1
01:54:25.384 --> 01:54:28.140
he's folding it into a little
origami bird.

76c5bd4f-be27-40e5-b284-82fc141a1021-0
01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.270
He's put the origami bird inside
it in a large envelope.

b3ec1697-1089-4786-995c-ad6c06a6364e-0
01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:37.090
He's put the money in the
envelope.

8d47768a-9a0a-43d9-9547-d794a28b9f52-0
01:54:38.050 --> 01:54:41.430
And he's licked the envelope
shut and put a stamp on it.

f8ed350c-bb10-44f7-9835-8841a5e6ebb6-0
01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.260
He has the envelope in his hand.

a0200aaa-d0b4-4ecc-8dc6-ea555d2e34a0-0
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:47.450
And he's walking down the steps.

229d7aec-c8d6-449c-a26c-68b7251b01a0-0
01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:53.210
The man has a dark suit and dark
shoes.

01:54:54.300 --> 01:55:01.230
And he's being followed by a
strange mouse looking animal.

fb73dcf0-44b8-4939-add2-cc6f49f0f337-0
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:07.640
He's talking to a woman on the
street, and the woman on the

fb73dcf0-44b8-4939-add2-cc6f49f0f337-1
01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.070

01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.980
Out of the basket is a tail.

44378142-4a30-4d53-8d94-488ec235baf8-0
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:17.850
She has on a long dark.

01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:25.030
Dress with a white scarf over
her head and she's pointing.

8127878a-0597-40b1-b43e-8ea8c1424be0-0
01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:27.960
Pointing towards something.

3ff86975-1224-4770-b9a9-cc90e9d8b0fc-0
01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:33.200
The man and the strange animal
are now walking towards.

ad542c73-e22f-4b1e-b360-c5ff52854390-0
01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:40.588
Kind of a mailbox. A mailbox
that is rectangular but it

ad542c73-e22f-4b1e-b360-c5ff52854390-1
01:55:40.588 --> 01:55:41.160
looks.

e55f0761-35c4-47a8-8a62-2bc7be6b35eb-0
01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.554
To have a kind of wings on
either side of it and he's

e55f0761-35c4-47a8-8a62-2bc7be6b35eb-1
01:55:45.554 --> 01:55:48.350
walking towards it pressing some
buttons.

c2135a7c-9eca-459f-9368-82418030d68b-0
01:55:49.090 --> 01:55:50.910
Pulling a handle and.

2beeea72-3d4e-4b04-b497-17899c3d51d5-0
01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.220
The little doors open.

c8101da4-2425-47af-88fc-5d427b7cd44c-0
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.230
And he's putting the envelope
inside.

3c806e3b-9509-478e-9e86-78cf63c52afb-0
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:59.240
The man's now looking up at the
sky.

9bb51292-b228-4176-a83d-d48a5afe14e0-0
01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:00.960
And these.

55858cf6-c0a0-4fde-a807-8f7ef9e3b583-0
01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:07.292
Walking away with the animal
along a hillside that have not

55858cf6-c0a0-4fde-a807-8f7ef9e3b583-1
01:56:07.292 --> 01:56:12.734
trees but very large leaves.
Leaves that are growing up like

55858cf6-c0a0-4fde-a807-8f7ef9e3b583-2
01:56:12.734 --> 01:56:13.270
trees.

6481187d-220a-4e10-8b1b-26582bd5f626-0
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:21.341
And flying behind him is now the
mailbox with a being being

6481187d-220a-4e10-8b1b-26582bd5f626-1
01:56:21.341 --> 01:56:24.170
floated by a large ball.

8e81e914-f0c3-4be0-9728-a459a1cbfffe-0
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:31.520
One of the leaves is now
splitting open.

f59dcb11-bbae-4ad7-a6b8-0824e4639951-0
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:34.570
And as it splits open.

8eccc567-03ad-44d8-8204-bd781a071174-0
01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:42.243
There is something that's
growing out of the middle,

8eccc567-03ad-44d8-8204-bd781a071174-1
01:56:42.243 --> 01:56:46.680
middle of it, so a stem grows up
out of the middle of the leaf.

cd5ac0b3-9522-4ce4-ac0c-66ae1868a72b-0
01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.820
And at the top of the stem.

bda51ddf-a325-489c-b8f3-9589506142f1-0
01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:56.300
A flower or circle is is forming
and a flower is forming.

61fc0d7f-bebf-4335-9ad4-84a49e48d2ca-0
01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.860
And the flowers becoming very
bright and.

3591a026-8b3e-4efd-a857-a17a602f2048-0
01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:03.640
Intricate.

57cc2240-6e39-4920-b071-edb9fc26bf14-0
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:09.580
With a center and pedals around
it.

e7f6a853-0054-4c30-9c05-22c7c19ca4de-0
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.294
And it's very bright, but now
it's becoming very dark and it

e7f6a853-0054-4c30-9c05-22c7c19ca4de-1
