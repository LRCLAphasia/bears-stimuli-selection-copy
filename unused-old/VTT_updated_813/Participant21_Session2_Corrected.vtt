d2bd21f0-5b32-46a4-95a9-31c18b9eb532-0
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.994
I will also repeat the prompts
as we go on, but we'll start

d2bd21f0-5b32-46a4-95a9-31c18b9eb532-1
00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:11.805
with just one page complex scene
and describe it as if you're

d2bd21f0-5b32-46a4-95a9-31c18b9eb532-2
00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:16.539
telling someone else who's not
seeing the picture about it.

de0006fb-d890-41c6-8dac-d79a602bc55d-0
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.352
Describe what you see and what
is happening and take between

de0006fb-d890-41c6-8dac-d79a602bc55d-1
00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:23.210
three and five minutes, OK?

2a1c2054-9ce2-4a5e-88e7-05ce0eafa56d-0
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.590
Here we go.

baa17164-0f20-4976-b04c-cedbd05ab561-0
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.469
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
I'm seeing {can, I'm in the

baa17164-0f20-4976-b04c-cedbd05ab561-1
00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.112
first click, got it here. So
that gets out of the middle. OK}

baa17164-0f20-4976-b04c-cedbd05ab561-2
00:00:36.112 --> 00:00:40.606
OK. So I'm seeing again what's
like a color book, open face

baa17164-0f20-4976-b04c-cedbd05ab561-3
00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:45.550
color book for probably, I'd say
for children and it is about the

baa17164-0f20-4976-b04c-cedbd05ab561-4
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.850
zoo.

2931a65c-8ff4-4425-a345-20ee180c4f22-0
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.190
And I see a very tall

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-0
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.115
Giraffe. And then another
giraffe that's right there with

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-1
00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.627
him. There's a rhinoceros and
people are trying to run from

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-2
00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:01.906
the rhinoceros. It's very
colorful. They're little tiny

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-3
00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.891
mini people. There's a lion
that's overseeing this

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-4
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.345
rhinoceros that is scaring the
people, but they don't look

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-5
00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:11.975
awful scared. They look kind of
like funny scared, if you can

56586b18-8992-4519-96cf-c6a9e259dc25-6
00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.610
imagine that. You know that kind
of like ahh

ae3f0601-6a2b-451b-a5c1-3a2a53b1a2b6-0
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.840
Um, there are. There's a zebra
and some.

982e3232-d353-4927-8ce1-1aa2a6367fdd-0
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.913
What do you call those pink
birds that's down on one leg? I

982e3232-d353-4927-8ce1-1aa2a6367fdd-1
00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:26.170
forget what they're called.

daa73b54-3e2b-4764-be54-d5c57db1c70d-0
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.287
But uh, they're, they're,
they're, they go in the water.

daa73b54-3e2b-4764-be54-d5c57db1c70d-1
00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:31.620
I've seen them in Mexico.

4fd328aa-4160-4051-8896-db5c91701104-0
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.518
Uh, it'll come back to me. Look,
there's lots of people just very

4fd328aa-4160-4051-8896-db5c91701104-1
00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:41.647
calmly watching the zebra and
the duck and these, gosh, I

4fd328aa-4160-4051-8896-db5c91701104-2
00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:44.210
would remember what they're
called.

52def2ef-7a20-4299-b4ab-2cdede908d9d-0
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.346
Flamingos, flamingos. And an odd
thing about this whole picture

52def2ef-7a20-4299-b4ab-2cdede908d9d-1
00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:52.480
as well is that if the zoo.

4a3beb90-2ebb-4bd8-8bb3-55efa21d4c32-0
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.736
There's like an ice castle, I
guess. Maybe that's where the

4a3beb90-2ebb-4bd8-8bb3-55efa21d4c32-1
00:01:57.736 --> 00:02:02.511
aquatic animals are, but I can't
see what aquatic think figures

4a3beb90-2ebb-4bd8-8bb3-55efa21d4c32-2
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:06.838
there are. But I can see that
people are surrounding this

4a3beb90-2ebb-4bd8-8bb3-55efa21d4c32-3
00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:11.539
enclosed ice castle and you can
see that the the animals would

4a3beb90-2ebb-4bd8-8bb3-55efa21d4c32-4
00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:16.239
go in and out of these holes.
It's like, it's like a it's like

4a3beb90-2ebb-4bd8-8bb3-55efa21d4c32-5
00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.030
a pyramid, but it's ice.

05714544-dc14-4710-95f9-21739e061a29-0
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.332
And let's see what else we have.
We have people that are just

05714544-dc14-4710-95f9-21739e061a29-1
00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:24.360
talking. I think I see a kid on
a skateboard.

bda00ad7-8ad8-45d9-a430-de6388c17be7-0
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.544
There's somebody looking at a
polar bear, there's some funny

bda00ad7-8ad8-45d9-a430-de6388c17be7-1
00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:31.958
looking animals in the trees.
Everybody seems to be having a

bda00ad7-8ad8-45d9-a430-de6388c17be7-2
00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.260
good time except for those
people that are being chased by

bda00ad7-8ad8-45d9-a430-de6388c17be7-3
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.100
the rhinoceros 

591752f1-5697-4aae-8607-63f642b6ae1b-0
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.710
There are some people.

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-0
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.091
And these are all just
characters of people. Obviously

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-1
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:46.977
there's an ice cream stand,
there's a big umbrella with hot

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-2
00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:50.798
dogs, there's ketchup and
mustard, and then there's a lady

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-3
00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:54.814
pushing a baby carriage. And we
have a shop where you can buy

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-4
00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:58.829
your souvenirs from the zoo and
a cafe where you can get some

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-5
00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.844
real meals instead of just ice
cream. And I think I see some,

3f3900f6-40f3-4067-aa6f-bcb0992c3f6e-6
00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:06.860
see some other people in the
background looking at elephants.

5463ee4f-3d23-4e0c-a573-fd5801994b15-0
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.850
Um, let's see, what else is
there?

3b54370b-cfe0-4bd2-925f-490f25626c97-0
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.676
Ohh and let me tell you what it
says that I know that I struck

3b54370b-cfe0-4bd2-925f-490f25626c97-1
00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:18.222
it is about now because there's
a little corner picture here. It

3b54370b-cfe0-4bd2-925f-490f25626c97-2
00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:21.550
says the Penguins were bored, so
they had to plan to escape.

3b54370b-cfe0-4bd2-925f-490f25626c97-3
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.986
They're enjoying their newfound
freedom, completely unaware of

3b54370b-cfe0-4bd2-925f-490f25626c97-4
00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:28.532
the chaos they've created. Does
that sound like I was describing

3b54370b-cfe0-4bd2-925f-490f25626c97-5
00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:28.860
chaos?

7c5eb3a2-f8c8-4b04-b3a0-41c53e882850-0
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.492
There was a skateboarder and
somebody's eating ice cream cone

7c5eb3a2-f8c8-4b04-b3a0-41c53e882850-1
00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:37.344
and then they asked you in this
book, can you pick out all 10

7c5eb3a2-f8c8-4b04-b3a0-41c53e882850-2
00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:41.258
Penguins? Now if the Penguins
escaped and I'm supposed to find

7c5eb3a2-f8c8-4b04-b3a0-41c53e882850-3
00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:44.923
them, it would take me a little.
It would take more than 3

7c5eb3a2-f8c8-4b04-b3a0-41c53e882850-4
00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:45.980
minutes, I think.

b6145c20-c3a6-4a49-8acc-1f655b4158d8-0
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.792
 {Quotes from the book. Just
this. Yeah. Yeah. }So that's

b6145c20-c3a6-4a49-8acc-1f655b4158d8-1
00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.411
what's going on here. Oh, and
then there's a gorilla with a

b6145c20-c3a6-4a49-8acc-1f655b4158d8-2
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:54.987
baby gorilla. {But we're we're
kind of face. We're kind of

b6145c20-c3a6-4a49-8acc-1f655b4158d8-3
00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:56.689
covering that. Your face and my
face.}

b62753e2-d263-4ba2-942c-bc5a4fcd674f-0
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.049
And there's a bird. And yeah,
most it looks like they did

b62753e2-d263-4ba2-942c-bc5a4fcd674f-1
00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.191
create quite a issue by
escaping, but they're not to be

b62753e2-d263-4ba2-942c-bc5a4fcd674f-2
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:08.410
found. At least not right now.

91796414-e2cc-44f0-94d6-fbcd75b7e3bb-0
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.050
They have a kangaroo at the zoo. 

850adf72-3ca4-4e0e-b334-717f82761ebf-0
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.620
And yeah, I think that just
about covers it. #END_escape_from_the_zoo 
Yeah, you took

850adf72-3ca4-4e0e-b334-717f82761ebf-1
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.750
about four minutes, so that's
good. OK. This one will be you

850adf72-3ca4-4e0e-b334-717f82761ebf-2
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.881
can continue doing the same
thing with this. Again a complex

850adf72-3ca4-4e0e-b334-717f82761ebf-3
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:29.470
scene.

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-0
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.996
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
Oh boy, this one is a lot more,

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-1
00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:40.888
like you said, complex. There's
a lot more color, and the color

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-2
00:04:40.888 --> 00:04:44.719
is also blended. It's confusing
a lot for the eyes to take in,

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-3
00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.611
but I can tell you it's about it
looks like an outer space type

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-4
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.199
of deal, like a science fiction
with dinosaurs. Here we go

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-5
00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.726
again, mixing these two worlds.
It's like, why do we have

5600e429-a311-43f2-90ee-3248851eac39-6
00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:58.219
dinosaurs and spacemen at the
same time?

b2a4e3ee-bda2-4d54-9b1c-2841069d515b-0
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.090
But that's one side of the page
looks like dinosaurs.

7475412f-9ac0-42eb-b719-f987e5f02abe-0
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.375
And the other side of the page
looks like the space world, so

7475412f-9ac0-42eb-b719-f987e5f02abe-1
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.740
you go all the way from.

d1693d30-9370-40bc-97bd-8af12a41d0cd-0
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.176
Ancient days to future days. Now
on the dinosaur side, it's

d1693d30-9370-40bc-97bd-8af12a41d0cd-1
00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:19.501
entertaining because it kind of
looks like like it's a play like

d1693d30-9370-40bc-97bd-8af12a41d0cd-2
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:23.844
there's going to be they're
filming this and the the

d1693d30-9370-40bc-97bd-8af12a41d0cd-3
00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:28.842
characters, the people have
sitting in front of their makeup

d1693d30-9370-40bc-97bd-8af12a41d0cd-4
00:05:28.842 --> 00:05:34.086
mirror like in a studio and they
have their own little dressing

d1693d30-9370-40bc-97bd-8af12a41d0cd-5
00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:39.330
rooms and it looks like either
they dress up like dinosaurs or.

b73a4a80-fa17-44b2-87fb-784abde596e5-0
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.361
It's real people with dinosaurs.
It takes a little bit to, you

b73a4a80-fa17-44b2-87fb-784abde596e5-1
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:45.940
know, your imagination. There's
mummies.

a1d13e7b-9554-4e81-a323-5f8004241be9-0
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.368
This is probably all production,
really. It's probably all

a1d13e7b-9554-4e81-a323-5f8004241be9-1
00:05:50.368 --> 00:05:53.652
made-up they've got because
they've got real people in with

a1d13e7b-9554-4e81-a323-5f8004241be9-2
00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:54.090
Cavemen.

be58a234-ca44-433c-9682-e4c13abc22b9-0
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.815
And animals that I don't
recognize and like I said,

be58a234-ca44-433c-9682-e4c13abc22b9-1
00:05:58.815 --> 00:06:01.090
dinosaurs. And then they've got.

826239fc-09d6-4e04-9cf4-efe9efb583e2-0
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.517
Some people that are climbing a
lava lava mountain of lava looks

826239fc-09d6-4e04-9cf4-efe9efb583e2-1
00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:10.226
like lava. Maybe it's not, but
because you would think they

826239fc-09d6-4e04-9cf4-efe9efb583e2-2
00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:13.811
would be like it would be red.
Maybe it's just water it's

826239fc-09d6-4e04-9cf4-efe9efb583e2-3
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.110
coming out of like a.

8f6af70b-7ff2-4032-9ded-c9fec301d945-0
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.803
Like I said, like a mountain
that has an open top and you can

8f6af70b-7ff2-4032-9ded-c9fec301d945-1
00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:25.035
also see in this picture the
their movie cameras on the top

8f6af70b-7ff2-4032-9ded-c9fec301d945-2
00:06:25.035 --> 00:06:26.870
too. So yeah, this is all.

63098b13-38b5-4edd-a726-5a35daf9e043-0
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.968
A production of some sort that
has to do with prehistoric days,

63098b13-38b5-4edd-a726-5a35daf9e043-1
00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:36.250
but on the right hand side.

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-0
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.807
You've got the space set up, and
that's probably still in the

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-1
00:06:41.807 --> 00:06:46.477
studio. In fact, I'm positive of
it. Now, there are more of these

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-2
00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:50.864
little actors, and some of them
are dressed up as a spaceman.

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-3
00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:54.898
The other people look like
they're just kind of working.

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-4
00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:59.002
Maybe. Oh, I know what it is.
It's the cafeteria taking a

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-5
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:02.611
break. So this is all like
somewhere in Hollywood,

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-6
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:06.856
obviously New York. Who knows?
You've got set people on the

acd90187-1446-4092-8e8d-3691b82f6df0-7
00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:07.140
top.

a93eb6f0-054d-4a0d-b69e-721a7296055c-0
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.515
You know, dropping things down
from the sky, you've got all the

a93eb6f0-054d-4a0d-b69e-721a7296055c-1
00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:16.299
apparatus that you need for a
production of this sort. It

a93eb6f0-054d-4a0d-b69e-721a7296055c-2
00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:20.213
looks also like there's some
water or something in this one

a93eb6f0-054d-4a0d-b69e-721a7296055c-3
00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:24.519
for the spaceman, or a blue blue
ground of some sort, and there's

a93eb6f0-054d-4a0d-b69e-721a7296055c-4
00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:27.260
an escalator that get them up to
the top.

11b23a34-7dfa-4126-bcaf-925760cd8318-0
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.130
There's quite a few, quite a lot
of activity here.

bc8afd11-8ed9-4f81-b726-9a6b95adef0d-0
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.272
But I think, I think the most
entertaining is the cafeteria

bc8afd11-8ed9-4f81-b726-9a6b95adef0d-1
00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:37.869
part. Looks like there's a
little bit of chaos going on

bc8afd11-8ed9-4f81-b726-9a6b95adef0d-2
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:40.420
there. Somebody looks like
they're spilling something.

7f0660fc-5408-48f9-a698-af38cb39f163-0
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.391
And then you can see the cooks
and you can see that they're

7f0660fc-5408-48f9-a698-af38cb39f163-1
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:44.920
serving pie.

95624ded-582e-4630-a22a-7f964855ba5b-0
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.774
And Ohh, part this entertaining

95624ded-582e-4630-a22a-7f964855ba5b-1
00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:52.648
about that too is in this
cafeteria again. You've got

95624ded-582e-4630-a22a-7f964855ba5b-2
00:07:52.648 --> 00:07:56.000
people that are in costume and
people that are just, you know,

95624ded-582e-4630-a22a-7f964855ba5b-3
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.820
working. So just a blend of some
kind of production. #END_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls

591a8661-a758-4e1b-a494-2f862546f445-0
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.880
OK. Again, you took about four
minutes, so that was good.

c97c91a6-3b68-4561-82ec-7705ca57a0f5-0
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.125
OK, we're going to see a
different complex scene this

c97c91a6-3b68-4561-82ec-7705ca57a0f5-1
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:11.650
time.

c2b4c68a-a960-40c5-ac52-ef6762c8dde8-0
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.120
OK.

fa289145-4517-406a-8ea8-da5d1a6a23b8-0
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.711
#START_make_a_splash This looks
like a water park again. It's a

fa289145-4517-406a-8ea8-da5d1a6a23b8-1
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:29.913
open face, colorful caricature,
cartoon type of picture, and you

fa289145-4517-406a-8ea8-da5d1a6a23b8-2
00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:34.875
can see that kids are getting on
at the top left of the book.

fa289145-4517-406a-8ea8-da5d1a6a23b8-3
00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:39.917
That's where the slide starts
and you can see they're going to

fa289145-4517-406a-8ea8-da5d1a6a23b8-4
00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:45.119
go around and down and twist and
turn and come out into this big

fa289145-4517-406a-8ea8-da5d1a6a23b8-5
00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.039
pool of a whole bunch of

1f872fa6-6300-4994-836e-b690a14d7eb8-0
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.349
People and the people are
swimming. There's other people

1f872fa6-6300-4994-836e-b690a14d7eb8-1
00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:55.961
that are just waiting. There's
people on water tubes. There's

1f872fa6-6300-4994-836e-b690a14d7eb8-2
00:08:55.961 --> 00:09:00.201
an elephant, a fake elephant
that squirts water onto the

1f872fa6-6300-4994-836e-b690a14d7eb8-3
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:02.730
people while they go through
the.

3fc90a36-92d0-4b44-8e99-92322b46b025-0
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.030
The trail. The water trail.

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-0
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.248
And then, of course, there's
somebody, a young kid, who's

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-1
00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:13.950
squirting people just on his
own, hitting somebody right in

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-2
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.836
the head. And actually, I don't
know if you want to know this,

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-3
00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:21.538
but they can see that the guy
getting hit in the head looks

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-4
00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:25.363
like Bob Marley. He's got, you
know, he's got the dreadlocks.

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-5
00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:29.250
And the rest of the people are
fairly calm. {I'm going to have

82c25c27-389e-4506-8268-38f74b3d245d-6
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.150
to turn this off. Hang on.
Sorry. No worries.}

9e0cbddb-18ad-4a52-acfc-a40900de788d-0
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.260
{I'm sorry about that.}

52711416-66f1-4676-85a4-4c99b33cbc8e-0
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.144
And there's this, there's
another slide, a bigger slide.

52711416-66f1-4676-85a4-4c99b33cbc8e-1
00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:43.622
Wide wider slide where the
people are coming down, but

52711416-66f1-4676-85a4-4c99b33cbc8e-2
00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:47.353
they're also landing the same
pool. And above that is some

52711416-66f1-4676-85a4-4c99b33cbc8e-3
00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:50.957
other child. I think it is
squirting almost like what it

52711416-66f1-4676-85a4-4c99b33cbc8e-4
00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:54.878
would be a fire hydrant on to
somebody. That doesn't look too

52711416-66f1-4676-85a4-4c99b33cbc8e-5
00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:56.079
comfortable either.

5b3229c3-ad32-4f02-82d4-70feec3805d7-0
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.814
It's a water park. It also has a
kind of like a pirate ship in

5b3229c3-ad32-4f02-82d4-70feec3805d7-1
00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:05.630
it, with people playing on that
too.

5256930d-0134-4a68-a3ed-69e75f1f659b-0
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.600
And some kind of of a.

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-0
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.897
I guess you I don't know what
you call it. It's it's would be

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-1
00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:19.301
man made something that the kids
play on. They can climb on it.

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-2
00:10:19.301 --> 00:10:23.500
It's a colorful animal with
eyeballs and hair sticks out and

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-3
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.560
big nose and water is coming out
of it. It's like a dragon

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-4
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.690
because I think that's supposed
to be smoke came out of his

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-5
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.819
mouth and on the very right hand
side you can see some moms

916fcbd9-7b54-49b2-a278-06cdb1c8c340-6
00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:38.160
helping a child out of the
water.

a5a2ed94-6dc4-4e7f-adb9-696a9fde812b-0
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.850
And other people are just
playing with the the water toys.

a7011d5b-1239-4bd7-9287-cef06515b568-0
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.293
Um, there's another set of
slides that's coming down into

a7011d5b-1239-4bd7-9287-cef06515b568-1
00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:50.120
the same pool. There's a. This
reminds me of.

f5ed47e4-0687-4a78-8029-605169b93dac-0
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.990
I've I've slip and slide more
than more than.

cacd709c-042c-426f-9b64-b048200addb0-0
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.471
More than like a what I want to
say the slides that you that you

cacd709c-042c-426f-9b64-b048200addb0-1
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.180
turn on, this is more like just
straight on down.

c4b808fe-9564-4103-b3c3-6e472cbef2fd-0
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.760
It's like you're just gonna ski
right in.

d552d297-81c9-460e-973a-bddc9323f3db-0
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.274
Umm, aside from all the other
little like rubber toys and

d552d297-81c9-460e-973a-bddc9323f3db-1
00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:14.218
people walking around in their
bathing suits, I don't see

d552d297-81c9-460e-973a-bddc9323f3db-2
00:11:14.218 --> 00:11:14.830
anything.

0a33d6f1-bdcb-4212-ae14-c75241e63421-0
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.980
Extraordinary to tell you about.

ce6bf7d9-649f-468b-b5b0-46a3ffd7d9c9-0
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.383
Let's see,
let's see. Let's see. There are

ce6bf7d9-649f-468b-b5b0-46a3ffd7d9c9-1
00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:26.290
there are some trees. I didn't
mention there's trees here. #END_make_a_splash 

bb273bda-cc07-41a0-b8e8-a87c29c1b9ca-0
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:29.650
Yep.

69e012aa-f791-497e-a747-d5948eae3b51-0
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.770
OK. So that was about 3
minutes, OK.

2cf1af86-0799-4012-9296-69ad9a84a1bf-0
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.575
With an interruption from the
phone, yeah. OK. So besides the

2cf1af86-0799-4012-9296-69ad9a84a1bf-1
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:44.998
complex scenes we talked about
in the beginning, they're also

2cf1af86-0799-4012-9296-69ad9a84a1bf-2
00:11:44.998 --> 00:11:49.422
graphic novels. And this one,
it's about 11 pages. You can go

2cf1af86-0799-4012-9296-69ad9a84a1bf-3
00:11:49.422 --> 00:11:53.560
through the story, describe
again what is happening, what

2cf1af86-0799-4012-9296-69ad9a84a1bf-4
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.270
you see, and take between 10 and
15 minutes for the whole thing.

a58bc951-fb7a-4ffe-ac13-8d306acaaa06-0
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.410
#START_flowerman Alright, this
is um.

89c37157-ccb0-476d-bbf4-40773f867c30-0
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.660
How can I describe this? This
looks like it's a very.

a5649898-4403-489e-84ea-13f81df708f7-0
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:16.520
It's night time. OK, let's start
with that. It's night time, and

a5649898-4403-489e-84ea-13f81df708f7-1
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.980
it looks to me like there's a.

6e5a92cc-1bb7-400e-8cae-c4466657c8fc-0
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.100
Old

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-0
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.562
Water. Something that had water
in it, but the water is

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-1
00:12:26.562 --> 00:12:30.790
depleted. Maybe like a lake
because there's a bridge over

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-2
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.165
this lake. Now mind you, this
picture is very dark. There's

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-3
00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:39.903
it's mostly like black and white
and Gray. However, over on this

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-4
00:12:39.903 --> 00:12:44.350
bridge that I'm telling you
about, there's light and there's

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-5
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.724
a person and he it's a color
color-coded person. Looks like

4e5f88bd-3566-4c69-a6d1-06692498a920-6
00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:52.370
an older person walking with an
animal some sort.

334733d7-3c8d-4bd9-a061-16deb8b8730f-0
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.700
Like maybe a rabbit or a dog and
they are approaching.

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-0
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.639
Some buildings in the background
you can see the pink sky. And

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-1
00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:06.432
the important part about this
empty bed of what I thought

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-2
00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:10.618
would be water is it looks like
the car broke down and they had

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-3
00:13:10.618 --> 00:13:14.607
to get out and walk up this hill
to get to this neighborhood

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-4
00:13:14.607 --> 00:13:18.531
where there's a Ferris wheel.
Looks like it was a carnival,

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-5
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:22.782
some sort. ferris wheel I don't
know why they have a gas station

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-6
00:13:22.782 --> 00:13:26.902
there, but probably need to fill
up things with gas. There's a

d59bbcb4-fccf-47f3-89d3-339edf075a8e-7
00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:28.209
bar which you always

fba2af54-c651-45e0-a328-be0c82e0b4ab-0
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.334
need at a picnic park and a bait
shop so people can get fed, and

fba2af54-c651-45e0-a328-be0c82e0b4ab-1
00:13:32.334 --> 00:13:36.388
there's also another individual
walking over in the darkness, so

fba2af54-c651-45e0-a328-be0c82e0b4ab-2
00:13:36.388 --> 00:13:40.443
I don't know if they're going to
meet up maybe that that the one

fba2af54-c651-45e0-a328-be0c82e0b4ab-3
00:13:40.443 --> 00:13:42.190
guy will help the other guy.

eab47ad0-0231-490b-a53f-2bfa8572d42c-0
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.770
Uh, we'll see.

d23b352b-e8b8-437d-8c5e-d2f94cc2c778-0
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.418
OK, so now we're at this same
spot. It's going to continue

d23b352b-e8b8-437d-8c5e-d2f94cc2c778-1
00:13:52.418 --> 00:13:56.572
this graphic novel. We've got
the color, the person in focus

d23b352b-e8b8-437d-8c5e-d2f94cc2c778-2
00:13:56.572 --> 00:14:00.318
with the color, you can see
they're wearing a hat. And

d23b352b-e8b8-437d-8c5e-d2f94cc2c778-3
00:14:00.318 --> 00:14:04.336
again, I think they have a bag
with them. They have a warm

d23b352b-e8b8-437d-8c5e-d2f94cc2c778-4
00:14:04.336 --> 00:14:08.286
thing around their neck. It's
orange. And the rest of the

d23b352b-e8b8-437d-8c5e-d2f94cc2c778-5
00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:11.760
scene is again, very monotone,
black, white, Gray.

8564d955-2032-4136-bb69-326f102f9daa-0
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.398
If you want to call out
monotone, now you can see over

8564d955-2032-4136-bb69-326f102f9daa-1
00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:18.455
on the left there's some people
watching. They're just hanging

8564d955-2032-4136-bb69-326f102f9daa-2
00:14:18.455 --> 00:14:21.366
out, I think. And actually The
funny thing is, one of these

8564d955-2032-4136-bb69-326f102f9daa-3
00:14:21.366 --> 00:14:24.132
guys wearing like a wife beater
shirt, you know, like no

8564d955-2032-4136-bb69-326f102f9daa-4
00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:27.092
clothes. So if it's a cold, one
guy's cold, one guy's not. I

8564d955-2032-4136-bb69-326f102f9daa-5
00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:27.819
don't get that.

ff4801c8-4fd3-46e8-888f-7e9e138352a4-0
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.617
Anyways, they're watching from
their looks, like from their

ff4801c8-4fd3-46e8-888f-7e9e138352a4-1
00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:36.244
apartment or the building they
live in. It's old. This is an

ff4801c8-4fd3-46e8-888f-7e9e138352a4-2
00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:36.779
Old Town.

80c64b7b-5e70-46b5-9279-3f30a20093bb-0
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.280
And we're going to find out
where this guy's going next.

feaf6fdf-39b1-46a2-b2c4-077567e0f7c3-0
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.647
There's a little boy sitting
outside his a building with and

feaf6fdf-39b1-46a2-b2c4-077567e0f7c3-1
00:14:47.647 --> 00:14:51.560
he has a little animal with him
too, and there's a cafe.

f568afb2-5983-435c-8421-e1d538d6700e-0
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.727
So we're walking to this town.
We're going to find out what

f568afb2-5983-435c-8421-e1d538d6700e-1
00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.260
happens next.

203e482b-483a-4d95-801d-6c45e88f6644-0
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.180
Alright, so again our the
primary, primary

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-0
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.499
Focus or color of this is all
that that purply black and white

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-1
00:15:08.499 --> 00:15:12.270
Gray of the town. Now we're
being able to see into the

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-2
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.178
people's windows. You can see
that a man is sitting at a

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-3
00:15:16.178 --> 00:15:20.429
table. Another one inside looks
like he's painting. There's a

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-4
00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:24.337
couple more people that are
talking to each other on the

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-5
00:15:24.337 --> 00:15:28.382
street. Looks like there's a
lady, 2 ladies maybe talking.

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-6
00:15:28.382 --> 00:15:32.633
It's hard for me to see. There
is a child that's sitting by a

6791e14f-abe4-4817-b3d6-02f480d56a70-7
00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:34.210
wishing pond and I see.

bbe01898-8f8e-4914-8ee7-a6941656e638-0
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.469
This person, that's the colorful
person walking with the bag is

bbe01898-8f8e-4914-8ee7-a6941656e638-1
00:15:39.469 --> 00:15:44.090
walking up to a house and that
house is for sale. So I'm

bbe01898-8f8e-4914-8ee7-a6941656e638-2
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:49.280
wondering do they want to move
here? Do they used to live here?

66274d47-c624-4e6c-910d-0a972af130f0-0
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.570
We'll find out.

89e8b70e-622d-4e1a-999d-00e27e0e534c-0
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.070
OK, things are starting to
brighten up now. I think what

89e8b70e-622d-4e1a-999d-00e27e0e534c-1
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.910
happened was that that colorful
person purchased the house

89e8b70e-622d-4e1a-999d-00e27e0e534c-2
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.880
because the house is now not a
shambles. He's working on it.

89e8b70e-622d-4e1a-999d-00e27e0e534c-3
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.981
He's even got a lawn mower on
his lawn. He's got a cobblestone

89e8b70e-622d-4e1a-999d-00e27e0e534c-4
00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:15.886
pathway. He's painting blue
shutters. There's a tree that's

89e8b70e-622d-4e1a-999d-00e27e0e534c-5
00:16:15.886 --> 00:16:18.100
blossoming right above his
house.

6c2c7bc1-bcae-4128-ac55-38c204b177bb-0
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.361
And then then the rest of the
people, they're still, you know,

6c2c7bc1-bcae-4128-ac55-38c204b177bb-1
00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:25.479
they're still, you can see the
back black, white, Gray

6c2c7bc1-bcae-4128-ac55-38c204b177bb-2
00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:28.880
background of the people that
live there. And there's a lot

6c2c7bc1-bcae-4128-ac55-38c204b177bb-3
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.565
more activity, people walking on
the streets. There's a guy in a

6c2c7bc1-bcae-4128-ac55-38c204b177bb-4
00:16:32.565 --> 00:16:35.740
wheelchair. There's a like some,
like a Baker. There's.

0620324d-bd65-4d6c-bfc4-260ee9ea2d08-0
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.236
Looks like a Robin Hood type of
Pied Piper. Maybe he's just cold

0620324d-bd65-4d6c-bfc4-260ee9ea2d08-1
00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:42.510
wearing a hat. Oh.

41bbc1d9-4a16-471f-9f0e-15d344c545d9-0
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.470
Little guy on a scooter. So
there's activity now. This is

41bbc1d9-4a16-471f-9f0e-15d344c545d9-1
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.020
blossoming or waking up in this
town.

09b33c3b-db61-4ad3-adc8-8ce9d4293022-0
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.144
OK, so this next segment is
similar. The house is getting

09b33c3b-db61-4ad3-adc8-8ce9d4293022-1
00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:04.555
even brighter. He's got a rock
steeple and a purple roof and

09b33c3b-db61-4ad3-adc8-8ce9d4293022-2
00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:09.877
he's out in his garden, so
that's that's colorful. And his,

09b33c3b-db61-4ad3-adc8-8ce9d4293022-3
00:17:09.877 --> 00:17:14.932
the tree is blossoming and
around him also is still this

09b33c3b-db61-4ad3-adc8-8ce9d4293022-4
00:17:14.932 --> 00:17:19.899
blend of the dark white, black,
there's people talking.

d57707be-ba91-4084-97ca-d038b302e0cd-0
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.088
Walking, talking, just living
their lives. This child is at

d57707be-ba91-4084-97ca-d038b302e0cd-1
00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:27.036
the wishing well still,
somebody's pushing an ice cream

d57707be-ba91-4084-97ca-d038b302e0cd-2
00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:27.300
cart.

4ff0bab4-c340-4883-8e83-8614e4b474ca-0
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.970
The interesting thing that's
changing in this one is that.

8d81241c-f9d3-4472-9534-dc07cc68e663-0
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.630
There's also another colorful
person. There's a cartoon girl.

746da241-e06b-46f1-b65d-d31f7be503c9-0
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.215
And these two, I don't know if
they're gonna meet up or what's

746da241-e06b-46f1-b65d-d31f7be503c9-1
00:17:41.215 --> 00:17:42.240
going to happen, but.

11077599-5409-4616-88ec-b3a45e9bc020-0
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.488
Uh, that's her first appearance
in this book and this graphic

11077599-5409-4616-88ec-b3a45e9bc020-1
00:17:46.488 --> 00:17:46.790
novel.

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-0
00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.888
Ohh, there's a lot going on here
now, so don't know where the

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-1
00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:00.876
girl went. Not sure yet, but
there's a lot more colorful

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-2
00:18:00.876 --> 00:18:05.145
people. We've got one of the
buildings on the very left hand

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-3
00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:09.623
side coming to life and it's a
building where it looks like the

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-4
00:18:09.623 --> 00:18:14.032
little girls hugging somebody.
If that's the same little girl,

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-5
00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:18.160
there is somebody serenading.
There's the man, I'm told. I

676298e5-53a8-46c6-80ef-9492a832d0a1-6
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.560
think it's the man I

ffdf325b-b058-4b68-af86-ed6883e41dc6-0
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.371
Told you about with another
young person. There's a several

ffdf325b-b058-4b68-af86-ed6883e41dc6-1
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:26.854
other colorful people now. I
even see a clown that's so

ffdf325b-b058-4b68-af86-ed6883e41dc6-2
00:18:26.854 --> 00:18:30.400
strange. I think the clown is
also serving up ice cream.

594ec1b3-aa24-49f3-8fd6-29d7b704ecce-0
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.350
Moving along throughout the
pages, we've got some another

594ec1b3-aa24-49f3-8fd6-29d7b704ecce-1
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.899
building that's still partially
it's not all bright yet, it's

594ec1b3-aa24-49f3-8fd6-29d7b704ecce-2
00:18:38.899 --> 00:18:42.105
just still kind of in that
black, white, Gray mode. But

594ec1b3-aa24-49f3-8fd6-29d7b704ecce-3
00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:45.654
half of it is starting to get
colorful and the most important

594ec1b3-aa24-49f3-8fd6-29d7b704ecce-4
00:18:45.654 --> 00:18:47.199
thing, I think in this one.

ac0acdd2-b80b-48fb-865e-ae9d18d6738c-0
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:52.303
Is that there's a mover moving
truck coming to town. It says

ac0acdd2-b80b-48fb-865e-ae9d18d6738c-1
00:18:52.303 --> 00:18:56.495
movers and shakers, and there's
a lady watching and other people

ac0acdd2-b80b-48fb-865e-ae9d18d6738c-2
00:18:56.495 --> 00:19:00.623
are just doing their business.
There's the milkman I think, and

ac0acdd2-b80b-48fb-865e-ae9d18d6738c-3
00:19:00.623 --> 00:19:04.170
I don't know who's who's
unpacking, but it looks like.

cd14eecf-b91f-4dbc-98d2-c532b6550f1f-0
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.888
It looks like another family.
They're either. I think there

cd14eecf-b91f-4dbc-98d2-c532b6550f1f-1
00:19:09.888 --> 00:19:12.000
might be leaving, I can't be
sure.

2a8ff990-5de0-4d22-86fe-a86b2a26a674-0
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.462
It's almost like a transition of
a of a how housing environment

2a8ff990-5de0-4d22-86fe-a86b2a26a674-1
00:19:18.462 --> 00:19:22.630
like is it coming to life? I
think it's coming to life.

cc4ae8f8-1f19-4a36-802d-8faa4b052415-0
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.870
Back to life, yeah.

c47a375a-e6de-4a01-8b0c-599d8f0db962-0
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.255
We'll see what happens next. Now
we're talking now. We've got

c47a375a-e6de-4a01-8b0c-599d8f0db962-1
00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:34.693
lots of life. Everything is
coming in color now. This man

c47a375a-e6de-4a01-8b0c-599d8f0db962-2
00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:37.480
must have done something special
to this town.

50301f03-75d7-4811-9b5b-5646f0be05aa-0
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.744
There's a milkman or it looks
like a milkman dancing in the

50301f03-75d7-4811-9b5b-5646f0be05aa-1
00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:46.973
street with a young girl.
There's a man with a broken leg

50301f03-75d7-4811-9b5b-5646f0be05aa-2
00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:51.493
being wheeled by a chubby lady
and a little girl with big old

50301f03-75d7-4811-9b5b-5646f0be05aa-3
00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:55.941
round glasses that's talking to
him. It looks like the house

50301f03-75d7-4811-9b5b-5646f0be05aa-4
00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:59.951
that was being built with the
purple roof and the blue

50301f03-75d7-4811-9b5b-5646f0be05aa-5
00:19:59.951 --> 00:20:04.180
shutters keep there's activity
there. They're barbecuing.

176c3159-2202-4395-bad5-3445aa54fdbd-0
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.028
And there's people in the
streets playing, there's a a man

176c3159-2202-4395-bad5-3445aa54fdbd-1
00:20:10.028 --> 00:20:14.810
selling paintings and there's a
crazy car coming through with.

d4553e6f-87e1-4855-a748-523979143fce-0
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.170
A lady hanging out the window
with frizzy hair and people in

d4553e6f-87e1-4855-a748-523979143fce-1
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.889
there in their own little
apartments, just looking out on

d4553e6f-87e1-4855-a748-523979143fce-2
00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:27.928
the town. Everything's getting a
lot brighter. I'd see another

d4553e6f-87e1-4855-a748-523979143fce-3
00:20:27.928 --> 00:20:28.570
clown too.

5db43dc7-4c21-4b28-a49e-55e89fafcca7-0
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.843
OK, now this is quite the simp.
This picture is quite similar to

5db43dc7-4c21-4b28-a49e-55e89fafcca7-1
00:20:39.843 --> 00:20:42.678
the previous pages, except for
that it's got a few other

5db43dc7-4c21-4b28-a49e-55e89fafcca7-2
00:20:42.678 --> 00:20:45.862
characters and it looks like a
lot of people are moving towards

5db43dc7-4c21-4b28-a49e-55e89fafcca7-3
00:20:45.862 --> 00:20:48.499
the right. Don't know why
they're moving towards the

5db43dc7-4c21-4b28-a49e-55e89fafcca7-4
00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:51.583
right, but everything looks a
lot of people are going towards

5db43dc7-4c21-4b28-a49e-55e89fafcca7-5
00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:54.170
the right. We've got a guy in
the wheelchair still.

e609f8ab-2339-4354-b62c-97dc3590448f-0
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.430
We've got somebody pushing or
pulling a cart, flowers. There's

e609f8ab-2339-4354-b62c-97dc3590448f-1
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.618
a dog in the street now. People
at the house where I was telling

e609f8ab-2339-4354-b62c-97dc3590448f-2
00:21:03.618 --> 00:21:07.485
you about that house is like
they've gone inside now. Maybe

e609f8ab-2339-4354-b62c-97dc3590448f-3
00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:11.481
it's coming towards night. It
says it's 8:50 on the clock, so

e609f8ab-2339-4354-b62c-97dc3590448f-4
00:21:11.481 --> 00:21:15.218
I think it's coming to evening.
People are starting to go

e609f8ab-2339-4354-b62c-97dc3590448f-5
00:21:15.218 --> 00:21:15.670
inside.

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-0
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.277
And maybe start to go to bed.
There's a sweet little couple.

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-1
00:21:21.277 --> 00:21:25.937
They're older, they're hugging
each other. And I think they

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-2
00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:31.063
might be somewhere where there's
music, street music, and they've

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-3
00:21:31.063 --> 00:21:35.490
got the fountains on that
colorful. Now the fountain has

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-4
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.149
color and there's a a lady and
her daughter, I think there.

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-5
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:44.965
Let's see. Nothing else that I
can think of. I tell you about

b4ebf874-6c5d-446a-a7e0-501235732f97-6
00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:46.130
the milk truck.

4b79a601-b7be-4b78-9feb-92573e128a17-0
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.689
Um, and there's a man sitting
outside of the building, just

4b79a601-b7be-4b78-9feb-92573e128a17-1
00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:56.245
relaxing. Here we have somebody
with a, what do you call those

4b79a601-b7be-4b78-9feb-92573e128a17-2
00:21:56.245 --> 00:22:00.730
scope. And tell us not to tell.
I think it's telescope. Yeah.

94651a68-547e-4abb-a503-e0713c2fed37-0
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:06.350
Where an older man showing his,
uh, younger children the sky.

bf77db34-44b2-415b-9010-6e76f735ec38-0
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.100
And strangely enough, there's a
man on a roof.

fac4a87a-5dcf-43d4-ab61-799c6718f2c4-0
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.240
More than one man on more than
one roof.

a53b648b-b579-4e3b-baa0-aaf4b5fa3735-0
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.560
OK.

f684ca4d-0910-4f82-a56d-6955e9acab60-0
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.594
Definitely time to go to bed.
The town is winding down now.

f684ca4d-0910-4f82-a56d-6955e9acab60-1
00:22:27.594 --> 00:22:30.933
There's a few stragglers. A lot
of the windows are shut now,

f684ca4d-0910-4f82-a56d-6955e9acab60-2
00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:33.780
people. A few people are looking
out their windows.

1b2fadfe-eb38-43ce-ae75-32568b9f97f3-0
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.410
I think, uh, this part of the
town is where there's a soda

1b2fadfe-eb38-43ce-ae75-32568b9f97f3-1
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.610
fountain ice cream, but the shop
is closed.

d56bdb73-05e6-4a6c-89e7-e76b7bf06595-0
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.989
Most of the doors are closed,
just a few people in the street,

d56bdb73-05e6-4a6c-89e7-e76b7bf06595-1
00:22:47.989 --> 00:22:51.239
I'd say half a dozen in the
street, all walking different

d56bdb73-05e6-4a6c-89e7-e76b7bf06595-2
00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:54.432
directions, a couple people
talking and then we've got a

d56bdb73-05e6-4a6c-89e7-e76b7bf06595-3
00:22:54.432 --> 00:22:56.450
family that's sitting on a
balcony.

7086decf-4a4e-4bbd-887f-aad90a34a173-0
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.906
Looking out at their yard or
whatever they're looking at,

7086decf-4a4e-4bbd-887f-aad90a34a173-1
00:23:00.906 --> 00:23:02.760
they live in front of the
fountain.

d8c10b76-98ff-41f1-a659-68d9c8d20ccb-0
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.257
And then there's a curious
little guy in the bottom left

d8c10b76-98ff-41f1-a659-68d9c8d20ccb-1
00:23:08.257 --> 00:23:11.970
hand corner. I don't know what
he's doing. He's observing.

66ce5d89-7b60-4021-a9f2-eca9568bdcaa-0
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.526
And I see a couple upstairs
above the where the cafe is.

66ce5d89-7b60-4021-a9f2-eca9568bdcaa-1
00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:20.510
They're kind of just romancing.

44fb9950-69c4-4b88-a364-fe4e347ede66-0
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.262
And you can see the rest of the
town pretty much shut up for

44fb9950-69c4-4b88-a364-fe4e347ede66-1
00:23:26.262 --> 00:23:30.058
night. Not completely dark yet,
but they it's going to be

44fb9950-69c4-4b88-a364-fe4e347ede66-2
00:23:30.058 --> 00:23:31.039
nighttime soon.

19dddf49-8659-4700-a55c-8da7ebb33951-0
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.340
OK. So we're back to the kind of
dreary.

b41e79df-4246-4750-bb55-b54a18c9a3d1-0
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.830
I guess you I call it black,
white, grey.

cfbe244f-4d3d-425a-92a5-6eb7d8667e42-0
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.872
I mean, that's what happens when
the when the night sunsets,

cfbe244f-4d3d-425a-92a5-6eb7d8667e42-1
00:23:47.872 --> 00:23:51.325
maybe because we've got people
still in there. You can see them

cfbe244f-4d3d-425a-92a5-6eb7d8667e42-2
00:23:51.325 --> 00:23:54.510
in their windows, you can see
the awnings, the purple sky.

8db98d75-9290-4ff1-9d25-a970cd6b7b7e-0
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.290
And again, here we are back
towards the beginning where

eaa5c9ca-bb8c-4661-b99c-19e46483bf37-0
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:06.703
Everything is matted color
except for this gentleman with

eaa5c9ca-bb8c-4661-b99c-19e46483bf37-1
00:24:06.703 --> 00:24:07.520
his bag.

ebee02f5-a7e5-45f1-bf2c-10f3331fd61d-0
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.721
With his hat with his neck wrap,
which would indicate to me that

ebee02f5-a7e5-45f1-bf2c-10f3331fd61d-1
00:24:12.721 --> 00:24:16.514
was a little bit cold there, and
his animal and he's looking at

ebee02f5-a7e5-45f1-bf2c-10f3331fd61d-2
00:24:16.514 --> 00:24:20.128
the for sale sign and there's
people looking at him from the

ebee02f5-a7e5-45f1-bf2c-10f3331fd61d-3
00:24:20.128 --> 00:24:23.624
window, like what are you doing?
Are you going to, are you

ebee02f5-a7e5-45f1-bf2c-10f3331fd61d-4
00:24:23.624 --> 00:24:27.180
thinking about buying this
place? Who are you? What are you

ebee02f5-a7e5-45f1-bf2c-10f3331fd61d-5
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.780
doing here? kinda like that

af81e0fd-ec66-4e86-9b03-062bdf252692-0
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.397
and also there is a pizza man in
background making some pizza.

af81e0fd-ec66-4e86-9b03-062bdf252692-1
00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:33.273
We're going to find out what's
happening with this older man

af81e0fd-ec66-4e86-9b03-062bdf252692-2
00:24:33.273 --> 00:24:35.241
with he's holding the business
card like he's going to buy this

af81e0fd-ec66-4e86-9b03-062bdf252692-3
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.009
place or he's interested.

fc14a515-f107-4d63-b679-ad63897bc990-0
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.320
OK now.

8b4e7cd6-b54f-458a-bfc7-1eb4d2908d24-0
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:45.298
This, the man is still involved.
This picture is completely

8b4e7cd6-b54f-458a-bfc7-1eb4d2908d24-1
00:24:45.298 --> 00:24:50.147
changed form in terms of size,
we're down to where we had a

8b4e7cd6-b54f-458a-bfc7-1eb4d2908d24-2
00:24:50.147 --> 00:24:51.440
whole spread of.

a07fb557-998a-433c-b4f5-7146525df597-0
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.846
{I think I'm doing the wrong
thing right now. I think I'm

a07fb557-998a-433c-b4f5-7146525df597-1
00:24:56.846 --> 00:24:59.430
doing too descriptive } anyways
little girl

88036fa2-a66a-4fdc-9a09-e6b53d7afe73-0
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.170
Has found life in a flower.

40f2c4b0-ca18-446f-bad1-5021c785a90f-0
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.790
She's colorful and it looks like
her mother or father.

8a53f91f-9f98-42ef-93c6-bff1dd8e435b-0
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.313
In the window
also has a flower, and the man

8a53f91f-9f98-42ef-93c6-bff1dd8e435b-1
00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:19.647
is passing. We'll find out maybe
where the man goes, life

8a53f91f-9f98-42ef-93c6-bff1dd8e435b-2
00:25:19.647 --> 00:25:20.320
develops. #END_flowerman 

9a5c3089-082b-486b-81fb-a74b709fc4ac-0
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.219
Don't know, alright. That was
the story, was it? That was the

9a5c3089-082b-486b-81fb-a74b709fc4ac-1
00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:27.810
story.

dc8bdd4e-0093-4f98-b7b1-9b7bc00d5856-0
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.200
Hmm. OK. Interesting. That's
good. Yeah.

002311ad-cfeb-4441-9f91-20616fa75a12-0
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.530
OK, switching it up, we're
going back to complex scene. The

002311ad-cfeb-4441-9f91-20616fa75a12-1
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.853
orders are all randomized.
That's why you see sometimes

002311ad-cfeb-4441-9f91-20616fa75a12-2
00:25:40.853 --> 00:25:44.354
complex scenes, sometimes
graphic novel and this one again

002311ad-cfeb-4441-9f91-20616fa75a12-3
00:25:44.354 --> 00:25:47.440
just describe what you see and
what is happening.

002311ad-cfeb-4441-9f91-20616fa75a12-4
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.942
#START_by_the_lake OK, well,
we're back to the little mini

002311ad-cfeb-4441-9f91-20616fa75a12-5
00:25:50.942 --> 00:25:52.070
people, the little.

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-0
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.495
Waldo type of individuals, let's
call it. But this is by a lake

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-1
00:25:58.495 --> 00:26:02.989
and it's a dry. It's a summer
day. You can tell there's not.

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-2
00:26:02.989 --> 00:26:07.409
There's nothing not great about
this day. It's bright, it's

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-3
00:26:07.409 --> 00:26:11.535
warm. People are in their
bathing suits, they're flying

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-4
00:26:11.535 --> 00:26:15.587
kites, they're playing
volleyball. It's pretty crowded

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-5
00:26:15.587 --> 00:26:20.081
for volleyball. They have a
little canoe, there's umbrellas,

dd42ed74-f981-47b8-940f-1c8f5f89876d-6
00:26:20.081 --> 00:26:23.470
there's people with the they're
in the water.

bf4a2e43-8317-45db-b9de-a981facda2e3-0
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.974
with their tubings and in the
background you see balloons

bf4a2e43-8317-45db-b9de-a981facda2e3-1
00:26:27.974 --> 00:26:32.475
being pulled by boats and it
looks like you've got a whole

bf4a2e43-8317-45db-b9de-a981facda2e3-2
00:26:32.475 --> 00:26:36.976
team of people water skiing.
I've never seen anything like

bf4a2e43-8317-45db-b9de-a981facda2e3-3
00:26:36.976 --> 00:26:41.935
that. There must be. There must
be a whole team, 15 people being

bf4a2e43-8317-45db-b9de-a981facda2e3-4
00:26:41.935 --> 00:26:43.080
led by one boat

07f5c7a8-faf4-4e0b-9b22-c95b78d12ac6-0
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.760
There's a funny little uh.

3493ce9a-47ed-4784-ab99-830d78cc48f7-0
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.280
What a, canoe left and it's got
a.

3a0712b3-2e4b-4e20-aa71-e93c3f34f83c-0
00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.713
I don't know what you call it.
Not a dinosaur, but some. Yeah,

3a0712b3-2e4b-4e20-aa71-e93c3f34f83c-1
00:26:56.713 --> 00:27:00.616
maybe. It's a dinosaur's face on
front of it and there's a man

3a0712b3-2e4b-4e20-aa71-e93c3f34f83c-2
00:27:00.616 --> 00:27:04.209
getting ready to jump in the
water. There's people on the

3a0712b3-2e4b-4e20-aa71-e93c3f34f83c-3
00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:07.988
paddle paddle rafts, there's
people in boats. There's people

3a0712b3-2e4b-4e20-aa71-e93c3f34f83c-4
00:27:07.988 --> 00:27:08.979
on a party raft.

30688cfc-ef21-4932-9265-53b109221f95-0
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.280
I don't see any.

ce5fe360-2993-499d-a454-4eedf632dd23-0
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.670
Any type of like not I want to
say protection.

f370038c-061a-4c31-8b90-02ab9684409d-0
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.140
I don't see any like, uh.

27e85d3e-8437-435a-b582-fb349bb44c7a-0
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.531
Oh, maybe I do. There's a
lifeguard I'm looking for. You

27e85d3e-8437-435a-b582-fb349bb44c7a-1
00:27:25.531 --> 00:27:29.285
know how when you have this many
people together, you usually

27e85d3e-8437-435a-b582-fb349bb44c7a-2
00:27:29.285 --> 00:27:32.615
have some direction? Somebody
who's in charge. There's

27e85d3e-8437-435a-b582-fb349bb44c7a-3
00:27:32.615 --> 00:27:36.126
somebody playing a guitar,
romancing his girl next to the

27e85d3e-8437-435a-b582-fb349bb44c7a-4
00:27:36.126 --> 00:27:36.490
canoe.

41e5e389-4187-4843-93dd-83aa1361a83b-0
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.940
Yeah, but there's no trouble.
There's no trouble.

62770619-a8e3-4c9f-819d-3c7fac12fef9-0
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.620
All fun. They're building
sandcastles.

d654e3c0-0dae-458d-9d86-d003c6313785-0
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.380
They're fishing.

e37f8ec7-9291-4003-9603-0dbd5ded9af8-0
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.990
Cooking in the background.

e6c07efb-9489-4edc-941e-6595cc1abc9b-0
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.587
Somebody's on his deck watching.
He must have. That's a nice home

e6c07efb-9489-4edc-941e-6595cc1abc9b-1
00:27:56.587 --> 00:27:58.030
right there on the beach.

e6c4b1cc-ea95-410c-9ac9-904b9f690ce3-0
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.490
Yep. And then what? They want me
to find the Penguins again?

842681a5-bf44-45e8-bad5-be1826829856-0
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.900
in the little corner of the
reading, yeah.

9283dec9-2397-4175-b80f-8ddbbf460241-0
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.240
Uh-huh. The Penguins are back,
OK.

3928c0a7-5ec3-4b41-8d2c-482b2220ddb5-0
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.599
Hmm. Alright. I
can't. I don't see the Penguins

3928c0a7-5ec3-4b41-8d2c-482b2220ddb5-1
00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:26.020
yet. #END_by_the_lake Yeah, there with that many
people, it's hard to find them.

79c22f1c-8f89-4c70-ade9-841ce04b3c2c-0
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.730
So that was about just about 3
minutes, and we'll go on to the

79c22f1c-8f89-4c70-ade9-841ce04b3c2c-1
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:36.540
next one. As you can see, it's a
graphic novel containing about

79c22f1c-8f89-4c70-ade9-841ce04b3c2c-2
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.974
20 pages. Again, tell the story
and take between 10 and 15

79c22f1c-8f89-4c70-ade9-841ce04b3c2c-3
00:28:40.974 --> 00:28:43.529
minutes for the whole thing,
OK?

a3feb188-c7b2-4e21-a0bf-e52a56f77158-0
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.250
#START_return OK, this is gonna

6b83bf31-34dd-43ae-adea-c1805ed0755f-0
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.280
I don't know what to call it a.

64820a8d-467b-4c0d-8b78-57c53dd414ff-0
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.625
When you open a book and it
gives acknowledgements to people

64820a8d-467b-4c0d-8b78-57c53dd414ff-1
00:28:57.625 --> 00:29:01.628
this book was written, it says
for my parents and it's special.

64820a8d-467b-4c0d-8b78-57c53dd414ff-2
00:29:01.628 --> 00:29:03.880
Thanks so and so for this and
that.

0a4b8c7e-cf13-4da3-8927-bdc3d96b9b0b-0
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.910
And uh.

787f2fe7-bc81-4de5-8b01-41803113cd1b-0
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:14.237
Starts out with a street light,
the street lights red. You move

787f2fe7-bc81-4de5-8b01-41803113cd1b-1
00:29:14.237 --> 00:29:19.166
on over and there's a red kite
and a caricature. It looks like

787f2fe7-bc81-4de5-8b01-41803113cd1b-2
00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:21.670
he's drawing on a drawing board.

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-0
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.561
He's upstairs. And according to
this picture, this is a brick

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-1
00:29:27.561 --> 00:29:31.248
building, an older building
which probably heated by some

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-2
00:29:31.248 --> 00:29:35.316
kind of, you know, it's not like
nowadays with the electric and

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-3
00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:39.257
gas, it's something else. You
see that pipes and it's a sepia

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-4
00:29:39.257 --> 00:29:43.198
picture. It's probably, I guess
this would probably be in the

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-5
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.885
40s. Maybe. You can see their
kitchen, it's very nice and

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-6
00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:50.445
neatly organized. You can see
that there's at least two

6248ee95-f9ba-4c37-a1b2-d519a266f79f-7
00:29:50.445 --> 00:29:52.670
staircases to get up to that
room.

8f3065fd-092f-45b3-bddd-40bd44754cd0-0
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.192
Where this man is sitting in his
shorts drawing something, but

8f3065fd-092f-45b3-bddd-40bd44754cd0-1
00:29:57.192 --> 00:30:01.534
there's a red kite behind him
again. Could tell that kite went

8f3065fd-092f-45b3-bddd-40bd44754cd0-2
00:30:01.534 --> 00:30:02.430
upstairs now.

943eb25f-6929-45bf-a8e2-8ed60e4caea0-0
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.942
It looks like on the right hand
side of this picture if you

943eb25f-6929-45bf-a8e2-8ed60e4caea0-1
00:30:06.942 --> 00:30:07.740
followed along.

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-0
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.740
Somebody's drawing ohh, this is
going to be one of those ones

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-1
00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.866
where you go through the
imaginary door. I think that I

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-2
00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:19.159
know what it is. That's the
father. The father's doing his

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-3
00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:22.452
work upstairs and the son is
downstairs in his bedroom and

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-4
00:30:22.452 --> 00:30:25.745
he's going to make at least a
little secret out about he's

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-5
00:30:25.745 --> 00:30:29.374
going to open the door, he's got
red crayon again. He's going to

c63a7be1-8ae4-48d8-a5d8-c29ab117011e-6
00:30:29.374 --> 00:30:31.830
open that door. He's going to go
somewhere.

a35ea178-aeb7-478f-ad4b-82ee53904f11-0
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.980
Got a ball in his hand, I think.

18a11338-fbab-4c26-8cc6-d604a5886f03-0
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.010
There you go. OK, so.

07c174f7-7d16-49b8-8e53-8ac23b6c75e4-0
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.096
It looks like I was right on the
left hand side of this page.

07c174f7-7d16-49b8-8e53-8ac23b6c75e4-1
00:30:47.096 --> 00:30:49.530
We've got a father or
supervisor.

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-0
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:54.377
Uh, who's working on his drawing
board and sees that there's a

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-1
00:30:54.377 --> 00:30:58.470
kite that has been dropped right
behind him and at his desk, and

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-2
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.311
the kite was part of what was
going on with the child at the

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-3
00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:06.404
bottom right earlier. So he sees
this kite, he stopped his work.

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-4
00:31:06.404 --> 00:31:10.183
Now he's wanting to know what
where did this kite come from

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-5
00:31:10.183 --> 00:31:14.024
and why is it here? Next thing
you know, he's not there, but

28aae28f-8758-4733-8291-525676774935-6
00:31:14.024 --> 00:31:14.780
the kite is.

d38a00a7-103e-4fef-96e7-bd898a07a673-0
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.074
Moving over to the next picture,
you can see that he went into

d38a00a7-103e-4fef-96e7-bd898a07a673-1
00:31:19.074 --> 00:31:21.570
his the child's room, the little
boy's room.

2f68add2-dc51-4379-ae33-2333604387c7-0
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.825
And he's there's no child
anymore. But he, this person,

2f68add2-dc51-4379-ae33-2333604387c7-1
00:31:26.825 --> 00:31:31.129
this elder, lets just call the
father, is looking through this

2f68add2-dc51-4379-ae33-2333604387c7-2
00:31:31.129 --> 00:31:35.433
imaginary door, the red door.
He's looking for this child. The

2f68add2-dc51-4379-ae33-2333604387c7-3
00:31:35.433 --> 00:31:37.620
child must have escaped somehow.

cd7f09c6-2fe1-403b-843d-17ac3c25fb51-0
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:46.046
And so then this adult person
goes through the door and he's

cd7f09c6-2fe1-403b-843d-17ac3c25fb51-1
00:31:46.046 --> 00:31:49.520
now outside. He's outside in a
magical.

f4351a2c-d24b-4ead-80a5-a274a354a4b7-0
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:55.180
Forest with lamps hanging from
the trees.

05071cf5-930b-4c2a-babd-8bde520d2fd6-0
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.880
And he's looking across the way
over some water to a little

05071cf5-930b-4c2a-babd-8bde520d2fd6-1
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.440
bench.

1af3539b-fabc-470a-9a86-968d0975f9ca-0
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:07.345
Or I guess you would call it a
dock of some sort where there's

1af3539b-fabc-470a-9a86-968d0975f9ca-1
00:32:07.345 --> 00:32:11.415
a little red ball. Now that red
ball has something to do with

1af3539b-fabc-470a-9a86-968d0975f9ca-2
00:32:11.415 --> 00:32:15.420
what we saw before with the
child and the ball and the kite.

bfacc1b9-4b1d-423e-89f8-e7bd8352f50c-0
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.374
All right. So I have a feeling
that he's going to try and

bfacc1b9-4b1d-423e-89f8-e7bd8352f50c-1
00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:20.150
follow that ball.

2edda6f0-b6e2-4483-a65f-5e9070899b17-0
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:28.002
He did. He went over to that
little dock over the waterway,

2edda6f0-b6e2-4483-a65f-5e9070899b17-1
00:32:28.002 --> 00:32:34.040
picks up the ball and he sees a
fixture coming towards him. It's

2edda6f0-b6e2-4483-a65f-5e9070899b17-2
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.870
like a it's a wooden structure,
like a little boat.

3e7439ae-ae55-4c6f-a327-c0d66e388f06-0
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.144
And it's, it's fantasy. It's
like a little animal head and

3e7439ae-ae55-4c6f-a327-c0d66e388f06-1
00:32:44.144 --> 00:32:48.008
little tail and it looks like
somebody could actually like

3e7439ae-ae55-4c6f-a327-c0d66e388f06-2
00:32:48.008 --> 00:32:52.069
stand in the middle. I don't
know what kind of watercraft you

3e7439ae-ae55-4c6f-a327-c0d66e388f06-3
00:32:52.069 --> 00:32:55.867
call that, but it's, it's
definitely fantasy. And then on

3e7439ae-ae55-4c6f-a327-c0d66e388f06-4
00:32:55.867 --> 00:32:59.601
the right hand side, he's
holding the red ball still and

3e7439ae-ae55-4c6f-a327-c0d66e388f06-5
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:03.399
this watercraft comes up to him.
He decides to get on it.

a3d832bc-26b0-42c8-91c8-e2e43f9100aa-0
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.630
And it goes away from the dock,
and he's now.

d91596f8-bb5c-4945-8a70-f4615d808273-0
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.123
Floating towards the castle that
this water craft is going

d91596f8-bb5c-4945-8a70-f4615d808273-1
00:33:16.123 --> 00:33:20.650
towards. It's a very intricate
castle. Lots of.

a4317a93-b45c-40f1-b0e0-8bc8427597e1-0
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.662
Uh, what they called it. I don't
know what you call those things,

a4317a93-b45c-40f1-b0e0-8bc8427597e1-1
00:33:24.662 --> 00:33:26.780
but you know what a castle looks
like it's got.

57c209ac-c063-4e6a-8e23-77bd64aab72f-0
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.150
When you call if we deep
steeples.

17cc7c61-bfe6-4e1f-a4b4-d184b7e72105-0
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.270
And again, there's a waterway.
It's like a Moat. It's like a

17cc7c61-bfe6-4e1f-a4b4-d184b7e72105-1
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.680
Moat around a castle now.

8e9c32d3-db54-406a-953b-3dbf2b97ddae-0
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.258
I can see up in the upper right
hand corner that little boy. It

8e9c32d3-db54-406a-953b-3dbf2b97ddae-1
00:33:41.258 --> 00:33:44.412
looks like if it's the same
little boy, there's a little boy

8e9c32d3-db54-406a-953b-3dbf2b97ddae-2
00:33:44.412 --> 00:33:47.566
in a red boat. So I think he's
going to follow along in this

8e9c32d3-db54-406a-953b-3dbf2b97ddae-3
00:33:47.566 --> 00:33:50.823
watercraft with the red ball and
he's going to find out what's

8e9c32d3-db54-406a-953b-3dbf2b97ddae-4
00:33:50.823 --> 00:33:54.029
going on with that little red
boat and is that the child he's

8e9c32d3-db54-406a-953b-3dbf2b97ddae-5
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.650
looking for?

a9bff0ad-43da-4efc-8b9a-bcd3ab35bd4f-0
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.170
Makes sense that it would be OK.
So he gets over to.

e4b6fb72-2709-4193-9831-4ac261a86437-0
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.223
Where there's more people that
the watercraft has a place to

e4b6fb72-2709-4193-9831-4ac261a86437-1
00:34:07.223 --> 00:34:11.420
park a dock, {excuse me?} And he
drops the ball.

42839266-cc80-427f-b035-11fd7722dbe5-0
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.195
Runs up, wants to know what's
going on. I think it's his

42839266-cc80-427f-b035-11fd7722dbe5-1
00:34:15.195 --> 00:34:15.520
child.

98a8af98-113c-4d51-9147-4532d9e14059-0
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.814
You can see that maybe it's not.
It's it's like a royal family.

98a8af98-113c-4d51-9147-4532d9e14059-1
00:34:22.814 --> 00:34:27.413
They all have crowns on and
there's security, bugler type of

98a8af98-113c-4d51-9147-4532d9e14059-2
00:34:27.413 --> 00:34:31.560
individuals protecting this
building this this castle.

cf63cc57-2d44-43a0-a249-1f89a9e8947a-0
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.838
There's the red boat is empty.
Nobody's in that little red boat

cf63cc57-2d44-43a0-a249-1f89a9e8947a-1
00:34:35.838 --> 00:34:39.296
anymore. So I want to know what
happened to his little boy. And

cf63cc57-2d44-43a0-a249-1f89a9e8947a-2
00:34:39.296 --> 00:34:42.377
I think you and I might be
hiding something here. Let me

cf63cc57-2d44-43a0-a249-1f89a9e8947a-3
00:34:42.377 --> 00:34:43.619
see if I can move this.

3f865f56-bed2-40d7-8387-61b4222d3330-0
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:47.860
We do view through side by side.

a63a20bc-f63d-4c0b-83aa-066f59158704-0
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.284
I don't know what to fix here,
but anyways, our faces are

a63a20bc-f63d-4c0b-83aa-066f59158704-1
00:34:52.284 --> 00:34:55.854
covering something like a chair
and there's somebody standing in

a63a20bc-f63d-4c0b-83aa-066f59158704-2
00:34:55.854 --> 00:34:59.423
front of the chair. I think what
they've done is they've they've

a63a20bc-f63d-4c0b-83aa-066f59158704-3
00:34:59.423 --> 00:35:01.510
captured his son or his son is
being.

29b9ec55-8140-4dab-9b99-5a1e0d30188c-0
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.170
Guarded by this royal family.

38b62f18-a5b4-4c2e-9ca9-deb01db6b706-0
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.341
And the man is saying to this
king or whatever he is. What?

38b62f18-a5b4-4c2e-9ca9-deb01db6b706-1
00:35:11.341 --> 00:35:15.458
Why? Why is my son? Can I have
my son? Why do you have my son?

38b62f18-a5b4-4c2e-9ca9-deb01db6b706-2
00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:17.549
Why do you have this little boy?

577f9a40-25f9-4c3a-8293-be354b768ff7-0
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.620
OK, so.

766cd3c2-8424-44b0-b90e-cb2896b51a42-0
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.430
We've got.

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-0
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.540
It looks like another intruder
coming into this whole scene

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-1
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.705
because the the Crown people,
the people that are wearing the

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-2
00:35:34.705 --> 00:35:38.871
crowns, whether they be real or
real, royalty or not, they're

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-3
00:35:38.871 --> 00:35:43.036
kind of taking heed that there's
another person coming out of

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-4
00:35:43.036 --> 00:35:47.268
this watercraft boat and we're
not sure who it is. So it looks

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-5
00:35:47.268 --> 00:35:51.568
a little bit like they're taken
aback. There's they're on edge,

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-6
00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:55.867
they don't know what's going on.
There's a whole bunch of other

fa73d83b-d40d-4dba-9a9b-fce015d049d7-7
00:35:55.867 --> 00:35:57.480
people on the next page.

d83c7822-51ab-4926-9205-9e3bee31c616-0
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.569
Getting out of this same
watercraft I think it is, and

d83c7822-51ab-4926-9205-9e3bee31c616-1
00:36:01.569 --> 00:36:05.871
the little red boat still there,
but they're trying to fend off.

d83c7822-51ab-4926-9205-9e3bee31c616-2
00:36:05.871 --> 00:36:09.180
What are these people coming on
to my castle for?

b68dc220-710f-42a7-9785-cf3939209332-0
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.440
Alright, so we've got.

af41b8f5-8fe8-47ea-b5c6-28074e40f0fe-0
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.980
The man with the crown is now.

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-0
00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.613
Kind of, I guess he's defending
himself against these people

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-1
00:36:23.613 --> 00:36:27.502
that are coming off of this
watercraft, but they don't look

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-2
00:36:27.502 --> 00:36:31.780
like they're bad people. I can't
tell yet. He looks like he has a

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-3
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:35.733
sword of some sort. And our
other people, the father who was

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-4
00:36:35.733 --> 00:36:39.428
the architect earlier, drawing
his his work, and the two

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-5
00:36:39.428 --> 00:36:43.251
children, now we have two
children with crowns on. They're

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-6
00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:47.400
standing in the background. But
the man with the sword, I think

cdda33b8-3b40-44a8-a4dd-4a07418e9bf3-7
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.149
it's a sword. It's a sword.

afdbe7fb-dbaa-467b-8cfc-797135a5cf15-0
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:54.809
He is saying back off to
whoever's trying to climb these

afdbe7fb-dbaa-467b-8cfc-797135a5cf15-1
00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:55.470
stairs.

0e8acffe-88a0-4c2a-a443-78cbbfd298a8-0
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.579
Well, it looks like they have a
music box, and I think that's

0e8acffe-88a0-4c2a-a443-78cbbfd298a8-1
00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:01.360
all it is, but I can't tell why.

9c785fc8-b3df-402e-899f-920a70013817-0
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:08.015
They are fighting over this
music box. And so at the very

9c785fc8-b3df-402e-899f-920a70013817-1
00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:13.201
tail end of this picture here,
we've got the the king, the man

9c785fc8-b3df-402e-899f-920a70013817-2
00:37:13.201 --> 00:37:18.635
who was wearing the crown, being
withheld by two other people who

9c785fc8-b3df-402e-899f-920a70013817-3
00:37:18.635 --> 00:37:23.245
have bigger swords, and
somebody's running off with the

9c785fc8-b3df-402e-899f-920a70013817-4
00:37:23.245 --> 00:37:28.350
time clock or the water, the
music machine, whatever that is.

b1618602-1502-40fa-9c85-2db9d805fb1d-0
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.240
All right. So we're back to.

eefc7497-4ad7-4ae6-b1a0-3cd405a91e73-0
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:38.600
A a simple picture of

7b7d5751-f30e-4cb3-a8c7-52826182a53a-0
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.440
One of the children is now
drawing a purple.

c7a0fd01-da27-44db-a002-c13436a0ad08-0
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.423
Wing like and the fathers
watching him and then those are

c7a0fd01-da27-44db-a002-c13436a0ad08-1
00:37:47.423 --> 00:37:51.597
the younger child that has also
a purple bird and at the very

c7a0fd01-da27-44db-a002-c13436a0ad08-2
00:37:51.597 --> 00:37:55.904
tail end of those those people
this is all like a lineup you've

c7a0fd01-da27-44db-a002-c13436a0ad08-3
00:37:55.904 --> 00:37:58.530
got the guy that was running
with the.

e20bec75-46fc-433f-af18-55bf4b987cd9-0
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.655
With the box, the music box or
time machine or whatever, you

e20bec75-46fc-433f-af18-55bf4b987cd9-1
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:04.690
know might have been a time
machine.

8395e750-c278-4bbb-aa69-de8be0d1b1f0-0
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.270
And the next picture we have is.

7f6eb85d-376e-46d0-98fc-0a87f61f7cc6-0
00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:15.158
The four individuals are flying
on this imaginary flying bird,

7f6eb85d-376e-46d0-98fc-0a87f61f7cc6-1
00:38:15.158 --> 00:38:19.680
flying away from this structure
where they're leaving.

dbc118a0-7407-4198-8138-50e01fa5ef9b-0
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:26.079
This gentleman, this person who
was chasing them with The Time

dbc118a0-7407-4198-8138-50e01fa5ef9b-1
00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:30.130
Machine and they're flying over
a windmill.

5b0b1925-19d6-4b5f-a7cb-9d5109ec1289-0
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.870
I don't know what they're gonna
go next.

139e6372-2eef-4fdd-b0d9-0becdd156e45-0
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.010
OK, let's see what happens here.

2ee1db94-f24e-43de-bcbd-d60a3609dea2-0
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:42.168
Looks like they're up in the sky
and they do look a little

2ee1db94-f24e-43de-bcbd-d60a3609dea2-1
00:38:42.168 --> 00:38:47.027
frightened, but you can see that
they're leaving. They're being

2ee1db94-f24e-43de-bcbd-d60a3609dea2-2
00:38:47.027 --> 00:38:51.733
sent away from this place where
they were what I call kind of

2ee1db94-f24e-43de-bcbd-d60a3609dea2-3
00:38:51.733 --> 00:38:56.136
attacked. The red boat still
there, the Moat still there.

2ee1db94-f24e-43de-bcbd-d60a3609dea2-4
00:38:56.136 --> 00:38:56.439
The.

bbb7a5ec-b701-4170-a4ce-8a029606cd19-0
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:02.666
Water device that this animal
water carrier is still there,

bbb7a5ec-b701-4170-a4ce-8a029606cd19-1
00:39:02.666 --> 00:39:06.600
but there this is like almost
like they're on a.

64095dda-76d5-47d6-a581-44ee012aed5d-0
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:14.090
A horse, a Unicorn, something
fantasy where they're being.

b146f55f-75c0-426e-beaf-29c82a93717b-0
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.240
Taken to safety.

484d5e61-2b2e-46c2-bf97-a44deb193c27-0
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.450


abd7cad2-7d6e-4f67-8ea2-e014c523bfd7-0
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:31.800
This flying machine where they
thought they were safe.

739c9de1-7beb-4418-b2bf-59742de625ab-0
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.440
There's

2072b05b-c941-49fd-8592-af598ebb7b5a-0
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.741
Purple feathers coming out of
the machine or whatever the

2072b05b-c941-49fd-8592-af598ebb7b5a-1
00:39:40.741 --> 00:39:41.890
flying machine.

8921c3fd-1359-407d-a561-218a021784ff-0
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:46.729
And they're almost going to
lose. They're trying to hold on

8921c3fd-1359-407d-a561-218a021784ff-1
00:39:46.729 --> 00:39:50.655
to the little boy. He's falling
out. The man with the Crown is

8921c3fd-1359-407d-a561-218a021784ff-2
00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:51.840
trying to help him.

9124b25d-bd88-4ffe-8c7f-e932d1b35df4-0
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.030
It looks like.

234d8e6d-efcb-4618-bec0-d35525b2e9c1-0
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:59.106
This is not going to be good
because on the right hand side

234d8e6d-efcb-4618-bec0-d35525b2e9c1-1
00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:02.905
what you got is people flying
through the air with the purple

234d8e6d-efcb-4618-bec0-d35525b2e9c1-2
00:40:02.905 --> 00:40:06.213
feathers. But the what I'm
thinking is that these two

234d8e6d-efcb-4618-bec0-d35525b2e9c1-3
00:40:06.213 --> 00:40:10.012
people are the father and the
son from the very beginning and

234d8e6d-efcb-4618-bec0-d35525b2e9c1-4
00:40:10.012 --> 00:40:10.380
maybe.

028aeb56-d8ea-4fd8-b4b5-bde5161db761-0
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.316
It's time for them to go be
together. It's just the two of

028aeb56-d8ea-4fd8-b4b5-bde5161db761-1
00:40:14.316 --> 00:40:17.440
them in that picture, the red
crayon and the purple bird.

335ac466-b1e4-4c8d-9cb3-e9c6d1c5094b-0
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:24.130
purple feathers maybe they just
need to go be by themselves

335ac466-b1e4-4c8d-9cb3-e9c6d1c5094b-1
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:24.720
again.

17b16639-8a47-4183-939a-9b85afd54b38-0
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.460
Oh boy, they've dived into some
water. This is a real.

006efc67-c031-4435-a7c9-954276e7aeb3-0
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.159
Will adventure the man and the
son. I can't, I'm assuming, fell

006efc67-c031-4435-a7c9-954276e7aeb3-1
00:40:37.159 --> 00:40:41.622
into water and there's some
fish, one big pool of fish, one

006efc67-c031-4435-a7c9-954276e7aeb3-2
00:40:41.622 --> 00:40:46.158
little fish all by itself, three
together and they're in the

006efc67-c031-4435-a7c9-954276e7aeb3-3
00:40:46.158 --> 00:40:50.695
water going down. And the next
thing I see, I think, is that

006efc67-c031-4435-a7c9-954276e7aeb3-4
00:40:50.695 --> 00:40:55.380
the little boy is going to Draw
Something with that red crayon

006efc67-c031-4435-a7c9-954276e7aeb3-5
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.239
to get them out of there.

a0b8b6d3-156d-46f6-a1af-266059df2652-0
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:05.496
It's true, it's true. They are
in the bottom of the ocean and

a0b8b6d3-156d-46f6-a1af-266059df2652-1
00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:10.284
he has drawn a submarine and his
father is down in the bottom of

a0b8b6d3-156d-46f6-a1af-266059df2652-2
00:41:10.284 --> 00:41:14.777
the submarine. The Little purple
bird is on there, you know,

a0b8b6d3-156d-46f6-a1af-266059df2652-3
00:41:14.777 --> 00:41:19.417
watching, and the little boy is
Manning the eye machine so you

a0b8b6d3-156d-46f6-a1af-266059df2652-4
00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:21.480
can see where they're going.

5bab197c-70f3-4b35-9b12-ee43bf0d688f-0
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:29.662
So this little submarine then
ends up in a cave and in that

5bab197c-70f3-4b35-9b12-ee43bf0d688f-1
00:41:29.662 --> 00:41:30.040
cave.

699d3c48-e122-493d-a031-3e8760f11015-0
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.880
There's all sorts of drawings on
The Cave walls.

f8ea1f93-8e61-401a-9526-1678b2c87b79-0
00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:35.840
Umm.

8e272fbb-033b-4dc5-a558-7fd6082cf857-0
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.215
It might be representative of
what they've just been through,

8e272fbb-033b-4dc5-a558-7fd6082cf857-1
00:41:42.215 --> 00:41:45.950
or it could just be something
that somebody drew on that wall.

8e272fbb-033b-4dc5-a558-7fd6082cf857-2
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:49.744
Maybe it's happened to somebody
else and they are telling their

8e272fbb-033b-4dc5-a558-7fd6082cf857-3
00:41:49.744 --> 00:41:50.100
story.

ce716198-ca88-41c5-a63e-a85523f7cb92-0
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.878
It's hard for me to see what the
drawings are of, but they

ce716198-ca88-41c5-a63e-a85523f7cb92-1
00:41:54.878 --> 00:41:55.460
definitely.

61a7157d-4a0d-47e4-b7ba-69e09afdcf46-0
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.630
They're in a cave.

a9fab40e-2d0e-40e8-a50a-12c436e81f6a-0
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:06.010
And the little boy saying to the
to the dad. Hey Dad, look at

a9fab40e-2d0e-40e8-a50a-12c436e81f6a-1
00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.890
this hieroglyphics. What do you
think it means?

7369a617-86d9-469d-87fb-b33945fecc6c-0
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.794
And they've got that purple bird
still, I don't know what. That's

7369a617-86d9-469d-87fb-b33945fecc6c-1
00:42:13.794 --> 00:42:15.360
just part of their repertoire.

cff53db0-045d-4f13-9ba8-68e0ad25d65d-0
00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.770
You can see on the other side of
this cave is freedom.

8f42f759-8105-41ac-8a72-b0662e841059-0
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:28.010
Um, openness. An open spot to
another part of the world.

e41de24c-e212-4cd7-a48b-ffbd31a7b863-0
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.580
Looks calm.

3c2fb363-1d9a-45e6-becf-4a4e4901606b-0
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.960
And as they are exploring this
cave and the hieroglyphics.

c381fc66-8c4f-494a-9980-41cec2fe2ebc-0
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.830
Yeah, looks like.

53da2508-7518-418a-8000-ab25310e6821-0
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:47.210
The watercraft has also parked
itself outside of The Cave.

bf87f347-7115-4024-8b92-4084906ee366-0
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.090
Let's see what happens next.

fdda97af-17ea-4bc2-a158-3e1929060328-0
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:55.720
We've got the father and the son
and this purple bird.

5d74fddd-d7d9-4bf7-8288-0e72c591c91b-0
00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.660
And the father is now going to
draw.

14a52d4e-4bef-44c5-ae42-45b3956ae1c6-0
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.780
That's where the kid probably
learned how to draw.

0cc5aceb-aa09-4cb6-90cc-4e489262deed-0
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.600
He's going to draw.

7d1d24b7-d0c1-4e92-90d2-906a23e6b141-0
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.270
Security for the bird, it's
either going to be a door.

f13958f4-7c3f-4ac0-b017-b148a88f5534-0
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.706
Or just an awning, you know,
like a a door face. But let's

f13958f4-7c3f-4ac0-b017-b148a88f5534-1
00:43:15.706 --> 00:43:17.760
see what happens next.

c4f3dd5b-5ac8-4c2d-beaa-4d82ce26be52-0
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.533
OK, OK, OK, what is this going
to be called, a bird cage? It's

c4f3dd5b-5ac8-4c2d-beaa-4d82ce26be52-1
00:43:25.533 --> 00:43:30.811
a bird cage, and it's quite
intricate. The father and son

c4f3dd5b-5ac8-4c2d-beaa-4d82ce26be52-2
00:43:30.811 --> 00:43:36.363
are now hiding behind a part of
probably part of The Cave or

c4f3dd5b-5ac8-4c2d-beaa-4d82ce26be52-3
00:43:36.363 --> 00:43:42.005
something outside The Cave, and
they see that the man who had

c4f3dd5b-5ac8-4c2d-beaa-4d82ce26be52-4
00:43:42.005 --> 00:43:46.737
what I thought was a time
machine or a music box is

c4f3dd5b-5ac8-4c2d-beaa-4d82ce26be52-5
00:43:46.737 --> 00:43:49.650
actually trying to get that bird

3d8fe45c-eac6-4e00-ace0-3c1e32fb20ce-0
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.030
Into that box.

db50fcac-cfe6-46f1-b074-75a495a134a3-0
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:52.700
And.

e51a246f-3db7-469b-a383-79aa25cb3c0e-0
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.160
I don't think we want this to
happen. I think he's trying to

e51a246f-3db7-469b-a383-79aa25cb3c0e-1
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.130
capture the bird.

5f3be623-e4e6-43d5-9121-13238094f98f-0
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.930
It doesn't go well. That bird is
not gonna.

5d88524f-8b72-4ea9-a54c-9a99119c29e7-0
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.420
Funny thing is.

a16f2481-99bd-49f5-8eb6-f8be116e4dab-0
00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:09.988
Well, turns around on him and
the the man ends up wrapped up

a16f2481-99bd-49f5-8eb6-f8be116e4dab-1
00:44:09.988 --> 00:44:10.950
in this bird cage.

2b645fa0-2a49-472b-a32e-e3fdba26f70f-0
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.070
And the father has the

78e861f5-b2fc-41ce-81df-300cfbeb02a1-0
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.130
Box that the man was trying to
get the bird into.

2dec83fe-2d40-4b6c-afc1-8c9591a0f39c-0
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.110
And this next part is is kind of
odd, I think it's more like.

2feb37a3-738a-44f4-9c4e-b3e30ad8b986-0
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.040
The man.

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-0
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:35.864
The man that was trying to
capture the bird is now stuck in

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-1
00:44:35.864 --> 00:44:39.360
the bird cage. It's now human
size I guess, and the

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-2
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.731
contraption that he was using to
try and capture the bird is now

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-3
00:44:43.731 --> 00:44:47.698
in the hands of the father,
looks like. And it's broken to

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-4
00:44:47.698 --> 00:44:51.732
pieces and as it breaks to
pieces all these colors come out

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-5
00:44:51.732 --> 00:44:55.834
of it. It's like psychedelic
red, orange, blue-green and the

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-6
00:44:55.834 --> 00:44:59.599
birds flying off with some
flowers around it, the birds

82ce2515-9760-4e62-84e2-20a48bef5e44-7
00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:02.019
flying off the sky and on the
right

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-0
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:05.390
hand side of the other page,
you've got the, the crowned

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-1
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:08.922
people again, the people with
the crowns, the ones that were

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-2
00:45:08.922 --> 00:45:12.397
supposed to be the the Majesty.
They are chasing after this

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-3
00:45:12.397 --> 00:45:15.987
colorful rainbow. And there's
still people on that watercraft

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-4
00:45:15.987 --> 00:45:19.461
that are kind of like in a
quandary. They look like they're

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-5
00:45:19.461 --> 00:45:23.051
they've got their their sword
still, and they don't know what

50713d78-5659-4bc0-a79e-b510ffd0d945-6
00:45:23.051 --> 00:45:26.409
they're doing. They're just
trying to protect themselves.

312258e5-4def-4f58-b0dc-44314a7525c6-0
00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.150
OK, so now what's happened is.

7d72c586-bcbd-407f-9169-fbf47c827548-0
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.970
The.

0fa80289-d3e8-45dd-a4e7-a1c8e66a1e02-0
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:40.849
Four individuals, the father and
the son and the crown, the king

0fa80289-d3e8-45dd-a4e7-a1c8e66a1e02-1
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:45.675
and the Prince, let's say, and
the purple bird are all looking

0fa80289-d3e8-45dd-a4e7-a1c8e66a1e02-2
00:45:45.675 --> 00:45:48.740
outside of this cave across the
way to.

a29cabac-adae-4702-bedf-5c5e23b9c573-0
00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.110
The watercraft.

5e29251b-bb2a-4c97-9840-ba8cdcd929ca-0
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:57.346
Going bye bye. It's gone. It's
on its way out and there's like

5e29251b-bb2a-4c97-9840-ba8cdcd929ca-1
00:45:57.346 --> 00:46:00.520
an octopus arm somehow involved
in this.

b67bafe1-2f0f-4dce-9578-9e8bca00ea73-0
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.920
Uh, some kind of flying bird has
picked up that bird cage with

b67bafe1-2f0f-4dce-9578-9e8bca00ea73-1
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.854
the man inside it, and it's
being carried off to somewhere

b67bafe1-2f0f-4dce-9578-9e8bca00ea73-2
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:13.988
else. The next thing I can see
is the father and son from the

b67bafe1-2f0f-4dce-9578-9e8bca00ea73-3
00:46:13.988 --> 00:46:17.789
very beginning are hugging
there. He's so happy that the

b67bafe1-2f0f-4dce-9578-9e8bca00ea73-4
00:46:17.789 --> 00:46:21.922
son, so happy the father came
and helped him. And you can see

b67bafe1-2f0f-4dce-9578-9e8bca00ea73-5
00:46:21.922 --> 00:46:24.590
his kite is going back inside
the door.

97a96da2-6d62-41ba-b5ac-aeb99647492c-0
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:29.752
It looks like the other couple,
the Crown King and Prince,

97a96da2-6d62-41ba-b5ac-aeb99647492c-1
00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:33.370
they're standing by the side,{
but you are faces are covering

97a96da2-6d62-41ba-b5ac-aeb99647492c-2
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.870
it. I don't know how to move
that screen.}They can only see

97a96da2-6d62-41ba-b5ac-aeb99647492c-3
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.730
what they're doing, but to me
it's kind of like.

66474f0b-351a-4ae9-93ec-ce67664e3f5e-0
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.340
juxtaposition between the the
father and son and the and the

66474f0b-351a-4ae9-93ec-ce67664e3f5e-1
00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.470
other father and son maybe are.

dbc613ed-79a0-47b4-b206-d6d1e1f5d7c7-0
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:52.472
It's possible that it's the same
couple or it's just two sets of

dbc613ed-79a0-47b4-b206-d6d1e1f5d7c7-1
00:46:52.472 --> 00:46:53.200
people, but.

afd802af-6765-4ffd-99b3-47197cb2dbc1-0
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.590
It's definitely um

a3afcae0-9fc5-4310-89f0-6a97d9dcf82e-0
00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.950
Come to conclusion that they're
happy they're safe now.

22ce9a97-697f-455d-9dfd-6fd5615e71af-0
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:09.153
And here we are back at the
original house, the Brick House,

22ce9a97-697f-455d-9dfd-6fd5615e71af-1
00:47:09.153 --> 00:47:12.330
backing up what I thought was
the 40s, but.

6f0a653c-702c-473a-9401-8d3a7843432a-0
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.020
It shows.

8f56c646-90b8-4b96-8288-54da3779bc64-0
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:21.832
The brownness and
kind of quiet, peace and quiet

8f56c646-90b8-4b96-8288-54da3779bc64-1
00:47:21.832 --> 00:47:26.036
of the house they lived in
various levels, multi level

8f56c646-90b8-4b96-8288-54da3779bc64-2
00:47:26.036 --> 00:47:30.775
apartment and all the big tall
buildings outside with outside

8f56c646-90b8-4b96-8288-54da3779bc64-3
00:47:30.775 --> 00:47:34.979
of their building that's
colorful and signifying life.

8f56c646-90b8-4b96-8288-54da3779bc64-4
00:47:34.979 --> 00:47:39.566
And his kite, his kites flying
over the to the trees. Maybe

8f56c646-90b8-4b96-8288-54da3779bc64-5
00:47:39.566 --> 00:47:42.700
he's you know had some fun with
his dad. #END_return 

429bed71-0e2c-4e87-b8d5-350531af97f4-0
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.070
Yep. OK, let's see if I can
fix.

4403a283-8f14-4eb1-8b95-662c18bcf36b-0
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.880
All right, we can try that.

f52b1bd6-8259-45cb-924f-f35d1a1dbf7f-0
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:55.857
So going ahead, we have another
complex scene. Again, describe

f52b1bd6-8259-45cb-924f-f35d1a1dbf7f-1
00:47:55.857 --> 00:47:59.290
what you see and what is
happening between three and five

f52b1bd6-8259-45cb-924f-f35d1a1dbf7f-2
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.060
minutes, OK?

38f816f7-52a7-4f32-9720-365dc8023df7-0
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.250
OK.

0c0415b2-46f8-420a-b506-f9bc700b6f20-0
00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.770
This is a my gosh, I should I
kind of try and make it bigger?

abc6fbcf-bc0e-4638-94b9-ffd7cc40d51c-0
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:16.395
Hang on one second, OK?
#START_exhibit_12 It looks to me

abc6fbcf-bc0e-4638-94b9-ffd7cc40d51c-1
00:48:16.395 --> 00:48:16.850
like.

29e7fb06-b507-4954-8dbf-6a9fe9208413-0
00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:24.950
See uh, museum. It's a Museum of
some sort. And.

5bf225ee-74ef-4c00-b21d-4baf942d5935-0
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.028
It's got a lot of people here, a
lot of people and a lot of walls

5bf225ee-74ef-4c00-b21d-4baf942d5935-1
00:48:31.028 --> 00:48:34.973
and a lot of pictures, and I'm
trying to get a little bit

5bf225ee-74ef-4c00-b21d-4baf942d5935-2
00:48:34.973 --> 00:48:38.850
bigger so I can get a little bit
more detail. Let's see.

5906b573-b7c0-48b4-b836-f8f2281fd9c4-0
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:44.580
{Go back to standard. That's
better. OK,}  OK, so we've got.

bf444a8f-53da-4f63-b502-cd7b0e8a4feb-0
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.390
A variety of people in this
exhibit this.

c60534ea-6ad0-458d-aed6-c5aa5ce36c9e-0
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.600
Like I said, I think it's a
museum.

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-0
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.573
But there's also people climbing
and on ladders and some people,

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-1
00:49:02.573 --> 00:49:07.116
maybe they're waiting to get on
the ladder to get up to the top.

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-2
00:49:07.116 --> 00:49:11.660
There's like lots of lines. It's
it's almost, it's this is worse

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-3
00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:16.064
than Disneyland. I mean, this is
so many people and so much on

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-4
00:49:16.064 --> 00:49:20.188
top of each other. It's very
hard to tell what this is of.

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-5
00:49:20.188 --> 00:49:24.382
But it's there's you can see
that there's different levels,

09ddfa8d-c413-40fb-917f-ad6d8d673b12-6
00:49:24.382 --> 00:49:25.780
like maybe there's a

9cbb1218-d2ba-41f6-ba1a-59b5567de006-0
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.259
Ground level, and then you go up
to the second level where

9cbb1218-d2ba-41f6-ba1a-59b5567de006-1
00:49:31.259 --> 00:49:33.830
there's some other wall
hangings.

3885e8b1-0234-4c28-9117-d62c8b5af2f3-0
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.110
And staircase to go up there
again towards the top.

e726be12-2cf4-4bd3-a79b-384df4e32bc3-0
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.850
It's kind of easier to see
what's going on you actually

e726be12-2cf4-4bd3-a79b-384df4e32bc3-1
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:44.050
see.

f7311d81-5b61-4306-9d84-1559803c4c86-0
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:52.252
The portraits that there are are
of people, of individuals,

f7311d81-5b61-4306-9d84-1559803c4c86-1
00:49:52.252 --> 00:49:54.930
families, animals, fish.

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-0
00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.419
So I've got to believe that this
is a public place. Obviously

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-1
00:50:00.419 --> 00:50:04.463
there's so many people here, it
had to be public. They're also

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-2
00:50:04.463 --> 00:50:08.700
moving some of the artwork while
all these people are here, which

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-3
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.616
seems kind of odd to me. It
makes a little bit more chaotic.

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-4
00:50:12.616 --> 00:50:16.531
Maybe people are vying for wall
space, they just want to get

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-5
00:50:16.531 --> 00:50:20.704
their wall space, and there's a
clown on the wall and there's an

851306ff-c9df-4e71-a8bf-dd59a697c18d-6
00:50:20.704 --> 00:50:22.630
upside down Waldo on the wall.

7051b4f1-bdd8-41cd-9e28-cbd472ac3b14-0
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.911
And there's a couple like that,
that couple that's in the farm,

7051b4f1-bdd8-41cd-9e28-cbd472ac3b14-1
00:50:26.911 --> 00:50:30.392
but they're not. They're not,
they're younger. You know that

7051b4f1-bdd8-41cd-9e28-cbd472ac3b14-2
00:50:30.392 --> 00:50:33.930
couple, they're the farm with
the pick. I forget what they're

7051b4f1-bdd8-41cd-9e28-cbd472ac3b14-3
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:37.125
called. And here's a funny
thing. We're in. We're looks

7051b4f1-bdd8-41cd-9e28-cbd472ac3b14-4
00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:38.210
like we're indoors.

c9a1ae87-6822-461c-8393-b262cc296f69-0
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:43.457
But there's people wearing what
looks like bathing suits, OK?

c9a1ae87-6822-461c-8393-b262cc296f69-1
00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:47.233
And they have, they have like
Viking hats on. I know this is

c9a1ae87-6822-461c-8393-b262cc296f69-2
00:50:47.233 --> 00:50:51.133
ridiculous, but just in the very
like, you're so much going on

c9a1ae87-6822-461c-8393-b262cc296f69-3
00:50:51.133 --> 00:50:54.290
here you could talk about it for
hours. It's like.

3f8aed1e-a2b4-4989-853f-281efd0de841-0
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.490
People in. In regular clothing,
people in.

2303dce0-cfde-40da-8879-2c2237ad57f0-0
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:00.580
Like.

f4daea63-f6bb-438e-bbd7-860bc3bdde0f-0
00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.641
I don't even have to describe
that. Just like they're all

f4daea63-f6bb-438e-bbd7-860bc3bdde0f-1
00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:11.514
dressed up in different eras.
We've got a variety of eras in

f4daea63-f6bb-438e-bbd7-860bc3bdde0f-2
00:51:11.514 --> 00:51:12.530
here. We've got.

53a7c950-f166-4a29-ba6c-5739ac61f63b-0
00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:19.270
People on horses, we've got men,
people working on.

878c01c8-b1d1-4d2f-bfb7-61956a9c3e2f-0
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:25.314
putting up wall hangings of
faces drawing. They're like

878c01c8-b1d1-4d2f-bfb7-61956a9c3e2f-1
00:51:25.314 --> 00:51:26.230
wallpaper.

63bc9d88-402d-4a8c-8c49-7a2842fb469c-0
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.350
People. Some people are running.

34dc7d41-e48e-4b73-8af7-48278f08262d-0
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.291
Some people are
trying to just looks like

34dc7d41-e48e-4b73-8af7-48278f08262d-1
00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:37.100
they're trying to take down the
artwork. Yeah, it's chaos. #END_exhibit_12 

63ad1b44-97ac-41bf-90ac-df0553250a77-0
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:42.040
Yeah, that was about four
minutes.

0a901f94-106c-4029-aec7-6d7c4dea9126-0
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:47.695
OK, so going ahead, we've got a
graphic novel that's about 8

0a901f94-106c-4029-aec7-6d7c4dea9126-1
00:51:47.695 --> 00:51:52.410
pages. So go through this story
and take between 10 and 15

0a901f94-106c-4029-aec7-6d7c4dea9126-2
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:53.130
minutes.

fcac7eab-fcf0-47e6-be1e-bdba82d15fea-0
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:58.340
#START_arrival_4 OK, I've got a
man that's taking a shower.

44bcc1db-d0cf-4993-8ea4-ee3c2f9a25b7-0
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.370
And then he's going to shave.
He's getting dressed. You can

44bcc1db-d0cf-4993-8ea4-ee3c2f9a25b7-1
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:07.630
see he's putting on his vest.
This, by the way, is also that

44bcc1db-d0cf-4993-8ea4-ee3c2f9a25b7-2
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:08.050
sepia.

600c1fe2-8f9b-4649-8964-2115e4fea23b-0
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:15.335
Color. He's tying his shoe. He's
getting his money in order. He's

600c1fe2-8f9b-4649-8964-2115e4fea23b-1
00:52:15.335 --> 00:52:19.531
taking his hat. He's got a map.
He's going to go somewhere. I

600c1fe2-8f9b-4649-8964-2115e4fea23b-2
00:52:19.531 --> 00:52:23.861
can't tell what the map is of,
but it's obvious it looks like a

600c1fe2-8f9b-4649-8964-2115e4fea23b-3
00:52:23.861 --> 00:52:24.200
city.

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:29.402
Uh, he's got some kind of animal
with him. Doesn't look like a

1eea5712-aff1-42ec-8171-9ebd020d060b-1
00:52:29.402 --> 00:52:32.610
dog. Doesn't look like a cat,
but it might be a cat.

f41472c6-a4d9-4aae-b4b3-d3a9f0b3d4cf-0
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:39.535
And he goes on his way, you can
see he's going to go on on the

f41472c6-a4d9-4aae-b4b3-d3a9f0b3d4cf-1
00:52:39.535 --> 00:52:40.090
bridge.

72020018-dd62-4a96-a5fd-271f2aa60b18-0
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.000
He's following the bridge.

bade32b3-20de-4d4c-8a0a-5073cfeb1beb-0
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.917
I don't think he's really gotten
anywhere yet. He's still trying

bade32b3-20de-4d4c-8a0a-5073cfeb1beb-1
00:52:47.917 --> 00:52:51.472
to read that map. And you know,
it's not a cat, it's some kind

bade32b3-20de-4d4c-8a0a-5073cfeb1beb-2
00:52:51.472 --> 00:52:54.914
of, it's some kind of animal
that I don't know what it is. I

bade32b3-20de-4d4c-8a0a-5073cfeb1beb-3
00:52:54.914 --> 00:52:58.300
think it's made-up. It's like a
big mouse with a long tail.

d8f61a77-ffb6-4683-8def-72eee6539262-0
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:04.506
So he ends up then, like the
final photo on our on here is

d8f61a77-ffb6-4683-8def-72eee6539262-1
00:53:04.506 --> 00:53:09.223
also a kind of fantasy. It's
like a boat flying in the air

d8f61a77-ffb6-4683-8def-72eee6539262-2
00:53:09.223 --> 00:53:14.420
underneath a bridge. It's still
the sepia color and they've got.

9309e4ed-97d8-422b-a0c5-8a063712cdea-0
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.590
There's people involved here, so
he's going somewhere with other

9309e4ed-97d8-422b-a0c5-8a063712cdea-1
00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.820
people. But there's like tipis.
It's like cone cone.

9b43e40d-fcad-4138-bb9a-c94e5cad3f97-0
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:28.613
Common structures being you go
inside the cone. I don't know

9b43e40d-fcad-4138-bb9a-c94e5cad3f97-1
00:53:28.613 --> 00:53:32.357
what's inside those cones yet,
but the people are outside the

9b43e40d-fcad-4138-bb9a-c94e5cad3f97-2
00:53:32.357 --> 00:53:32.720
cones.

7dbaff39-ec61-49c2-a287-756e31675d27-0
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:39.079
Well, he he and he was passing a
cone along the bridge, so this

7dbaff39-ec61-49c2-a287-756e31675d27-1
00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:39.480
is a.

5fd9c3f5-6e08-401e-a00f-c462df863ccc-0
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:43.120
Something that's fantasy too.

879400b0-ce6e-47ca-b0f7-fc1ffbc226cd-0
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:50.326
And here's a this is kind of
entertaining, because his little

879400b0-ce6e-47ca-b0f7-fc1ffbc226cd-1
00:53:50.326 --> 00:53:54.506
pet mousy looking thing with the
long tail is now meeting up with

879400b0-ce6e-47ca-b0f7-fc1ffbc226cd-2
00:53:54.506 --> 00:53:56.660
what looks like a female
version.

9b65d5bc-3254-4eaa-9fd5-115d39a47d53-0
00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.190
And you see the next frame that.

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-0
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:06.146
The guy who's reading the map is
standing next to a lady who's

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-1
00:54:06.146 --> 00:54:10.237
reading a book, and it looks
like her. She owns that female

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-2
00:54:10.237 --> 00:54:14.260
version of this animal. And
he's, you know, got his behind

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-3
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.488
him. So they're going to start
conversing and he's asking her

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-4
00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:22.580
where, where, how do you get to
wherever I want to go. He's

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-5
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.876
pointing at some, like symbolic
things, symbolic structures on

75510156-4f2b-4e5f-98ab-db80a00ce10a-6
00:54:26.876 --> 00:54:27.490
this map.

9242c357-4da0-4312-91ad-46e7221f0b8a-0
00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:33.710
And she's telling him that
there's a phone.

6e11e3d7-471e-4b88-880f-b5dc38177ad2-0
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.578
And they would can dial out. It
looks like a phone. Maybe it's

6e11e3d7-471e-4b88-880f-b5dc38177ad2-1
00:54:38.578 --> 00:54:38.700
a.

bf0446eb-989c-47ff-9294-3c8a68cb096a-0
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.557
Maybe it's not a phone, but
maybe a some kind of gate that

bf0446eb-989c-47ff-9294-3c8a68cb096a-1
00:54:42.557 --> 00:54:45.500
you have to know how to code.
Use the code to get out.

4a14cb63-3570-47b9-ae42-7a4696c47855-0
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:51.156
It looks like he's going to get
a ticket out of this machine.

4a14cb63-3570-47b9-ae42-7a4696c47855-1
00:54:51.156 --> 00:54:55.828
That's what it is. Not a phone.
I don't think a ticket comes out

4a14cb63-3570-47b9-ae42-7a4696c47855-2
00:54:55.828 --> 00:55:00.500
and she gives him the ticket, he
takes the ticket and he goes on

4a14cb63-3570-47b9-ae42-7a4696c47855-3
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:00.860
this.

85a324af-e8bf-4742-8763-d72625de669f-0
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.523
What I thought looks like a
boat. It's like a cement boat.

85a324af-e8bf-4742-8763-d72625de669f-1
00:55:05.523 --> 00:55:09.007
But I'm sure it's not cement.
It's something like it looks

85a324af-e8bf-4742-8763-d72625de669f-2
00:55:09.007 --> 00:55:12.727
like cement. It's like it's but
it's up in the sky and all the

85a324af-e8bf-4742-8763-d72625de669f-3
00:55:12.727 --> 00:55:16.389
people are watching it. It's
like, where's this? Where's this

85a324af-e8bf-4742-8763-d72625de669f-4
00:55:16.389 --> 00:55:17.569
spaceship going and.

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-0
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:23.067
The next thing I see here is
people watching the spaceship.

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-1
00:55:23.067 --> 00:55:27.345
The spaceship is going to land
his little animal and he are

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-2
00:55:27.345 --> 00:55:31.552
going to probably board this
ship. And as you can see that

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-3
00:55:31.552 --> 00:55:35.688
his ticket is getting punched
and somebody saying welcome

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-4
00:55:35.688 --> 00:55:39.966
aboard and it looks like he's
kind of an official. He's got

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-5
00:55:39.966 --> 00:55:44.172
some kind of hat on and a
uniform and maybe even some kind

5051d66a-ae22-49c7-8b63-a81b669763c5-6
00:55:44.172 --> 00:55:45.670
of protective device.

77917e3a-cc8f-4ff3-9743-2c1671ef3df2-0
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:49.950
So the man and his

175d96c6-f5d1-4b93-96f6-f77c2e512621-0
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.940
Strange looking animal board
this vehicle.

1ac9831a-1d01-499c-8830-cb8773051d93-0
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:59.454
And he's now sitting next to
another lady, it looks like, who

1ac9831a-1d01-499c-8830-cb8773051d93-1
00:55:59.454 --> 00:56:03.761
has a female animal. There's
other people on this vessel

1ac9831a-1d01-499c-8830-cb8773051d93-2
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:08.220
they're seated in like like kind
of like a Pew. It's like.

2bac5061-2a63-41bb-9111-532376965218-0
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.633
Like a bus or a boat would be
where there's multiple rows of

2bac5061-2a63-41bb-9111-532376965218-1
00:56:14.633 --> 00:56:18.577
seating and they start to
talking and and she's got an

2bac5061-2a63-41bb-9111-532376965218-2
00:56:18.577 --> 00:56:23.310
animal just like that other lady
did, and he's asking a question.

8d063a9a-74e4-41d5-a882-139e9511c049-0
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:29.089
It looks like he's gonna go look
for somebody. He's got a picture

8d063a9a-74e4-41d5-a882-139e9511c049-1
00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:33.487
now he's saying, hey, have you
seen this person? And she's

8d063a9a-74e4-41d5-a882-139e9511c049-2
00:56:33.487 --> 00:56:38.108
saying I might, I don't know.
And then she looks in her purse

8d063a9a-74e4-41d5-a882-139e9511c049-3
00:56:38.108 --> 00:56:42.879
and she pulls out a picture as
well. She's looking for somebody

8d063a9a-74e4-41d5-a882-139e9511c049-4
00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:47.724
too. And the picture you can see
it's getting, it's getting more

8d063a9a-74e4-41d5-a882-139e9511c049-5
00:56:47.724 --> 00:56:52.420
evident that it's a young person
that they're looking for. So.

ca054944-37d0-4546-817b-203d47939cb3-0
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.200
Next thing we see is this young
person. It looks like reading a

ca054944-37d0-4546-817b-203d47939cb3-1
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:57.480
book.

7a6e5c74-953e-4655-92a7-423aa4ae4682-0
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.850
It's possible that the person
was in trouble for reading a

7a6e5c74-953e-4655-92a7-423aa4ae4682-1
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:06.030
book. It looks like that
somebody is trying to take that

7a6e5c74-953e-4655-92a7-423aa4ae4682-2
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.600
book away from this person. It's
probably a girl a little girl.

cc876cd7-437f-40b4-a576-b794c678e030-0
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:15.717
Can't be sure. Somebody takes
that book away from her and puts

cc876cd7-437f-40b4-a576-b794c678e030-1
00:57:15.717 --> 00:57:21.194
it in a drawer and then locks it
up and then he takes he's making

cc876cd7-437f-40b4-a576-b794c678e030-2
00:57:21.194 --> 00:57:26.421
this girl. This is very kind of
a scary picture, taking a rake

cc876cd7-437f-40b4-a576-b794c678e030-3
00:57:26.421 --> 00:57:28.330
of some sort of a metal

f8e379bf-5fb9-4a7a-95e0-b4d82d454003-0
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:34.330
Shovel, taking the shovel and
pushing her towards somewhere

f8e379bf-5fb9-4a7a-95e0-b4d82d454003-1
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.310
where she's going to now.

9f02d9ef-ba04-4f1d-a55b-db64fb48ef06-0
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:44.130
Like feed fire into, uh, a
device, it looks like fire.

5d317b91-6d63-4c4e-b399-75f8abea598c-0
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:48.509
A ball of fire. I don't know
what's gonna happen. It looks

5d317b91-6d63-4c4e-b399-75f8abea598c-1
00:57:48.509 --> 00:57:51.892
like maybe, um, it's not really
a ball of fire. What it is is

5d317b91-6d63-4c4e-b399-75f8abea598c-2
00:57:51.892 --> 00:57:55.329
it's it's a stove. It's a stove
that in the old days you would

5d317b91-6d63-4c4e-b399-75f8abea598c-3
00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:55.930
poke with a

8fb11023-eb31-4015-b24e-19b53596c0bc-0
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.618
Shovel and he's making this
young girl do this and it looks

8fb11023-eb31-4015-b24e-19b53596c0bc-1
00:58:00.618 --> 00:58:04.231
like it's going to kind of
smoky. So she's going to go up

8fb11023-eb31-4015-b24e-19b53596c0bc-2
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:08.218
to the top and try and clean it
out. She's climbing up a ladder

8fb11023-eb31-4015-b24e-19b53596c0bc-3
00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:10.959
and she's going to go clean this
thing out.

cea681b8-0169-4aad-a6e3-a6f49fa65df7-0
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.261
Alright, OK So what this is ohh
I wish I could describe it

cea681b8-0169-4aad-a6e3-a6f49fa65df7-1
00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:23.211
better because I'm not that well
educated in history, but it

cea681b8-0169-4aad-a6e3-a6f49fa65df7-2
00:58:23.211 --> 00:58:27.162
looks like this is like a mining
thing where they would make

cea681b8-0169-4aad-a6e3-a6f49fa65df7-3
00:58:27.162 --> 00:58:29.170
people go into these individual

db5f2777-8107-41b1-a9c4-ebfea7e1b82d-0
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.500


ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-0
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:36.877
Not cages, but rooms, uh,
buried, buried segregated spaces

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-1
00:58:36.877 --> 00:58:41.454
where they would each of them
have to do something to make the

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-2
00:58:41.454 --> 00:58:45.524
smoke. It's probably to make
heat, to make electricity,

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-3
00:58:45.524 --> 00:58:49.447
whatever at the time, and it
doesn't look like a very

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-4
00:58:49.447 --> 00:58:53.807
pleasant space space at all.
This is on the left hand side.

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-5
00:58:53.807 --> 00:58:58.312
You can see that they're all
working really hard and then you

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-6
00:58:58.312 --> 00:59:02.890
can see the individual pictures,
like I was calling before the

ddf7123b-b838-4d0b-b315-eb6a9db84f29-7
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:03.690
tic tac toe

234449d4-7c6d-4083-aca1-587477ca783d-0
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.140
Board where these these these
people are really worn out and.

f426edc8-ad25-4b9c-bb0c-386e03ec16f0-0
00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.461
You see just a variety of them
trying to protect themselves.

f426edc8-ad25-4b9c-bb0c-386e03ec16f0-1
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:14.640
Somebody's trying to break in
the room.

58c36ca1-f9ba-43e7-9a0f-c54aa5d1759c-0
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.698
They're trying to hide. They're
trying to get to their book. The

58c36ca1-f9ba-43e7-9a0f-c54aa5d1759c-1
00:59:18.698 --> 00:59:21.828
one that was taken from them.
Looks like they're trying to

58c36ca1-f9ba-43e7-9a0f-c54aa5d1759c-2
00:59:21.828 --> 00:59:22.200
escape.

225648f0-6473-47c6-baeb-81191608b6ce-0
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.777
It's back in the yeah, back in
the. You can see that it's back

225648f0-6473-47c6-baeb-81191608b6ce-1
00:59:27.777 --> 00:59:32.090
in the days of trains. And maybe
that's how they used to make the

225648f0-6473-47c6-baeb-81191608b6ce-2
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:36.077
train work station work and
person. This young girls escaped

225648f0-6473-47c6-baeb-81191608b6ce-3
00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:40.194
and she's sitting by herself and
she looks cold, but I can see

225648f0-6473-47c6-baeb-81191608b6ce-4
00:59:40.194 --> 00:59:43.658
that the train is going
somewhere. So maybe she's on

225648f0-6473-47c6-baeb-81191608b6ce-5
00:59:43.658 --> 00:59:45.750
that train, maybe she's escaped.

e8840173-581b-45ff-80ab-2b11154aa9c1-0
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:51.760
And then we have this is another
country.

92be12bf-aebf-497d-a483-01cb98d663de-0
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.660
Maybe it's an imaginary country,
I don't know.

a1ba6b42-1735-45fa-a0f2-89ca6369ca57-0
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:59.090
Where this boat a flying boat.

112cc5f4-1ba2-48a2-ac03-d017237728d3-0
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.110
Is coming into town and.

100f9982-4bc9-48c2-9a5e-357397e29f73-0
01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:09.228
You can see that it's just up in
the sky, up against some very

100f9982-4bc9-48c2-9a5e-357397e29f73-1
01:00:09.228 --> 01:00:10.790
large structure of.

b6a9ff8a-d5b6-40f2-ab6d-48ef1c6621cb-0
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.612
Some foreign words and a and a
face of somebody who's probably

b6a9ff8a-d5b6-40f2-ab6d-48ef1c6621cb-1
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.230
important.

8e67fae6-bb20-4cb2-894a-ef2556eda9d8-0
01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.271
Now we've got back on the this
is probably the spaceship that

8e67fae6-bb20-4cb2-894a-ef2556eda9d8-1
01:00:21.271 --> 01:00:25.537
the man ended up on somehow, and
he's talking to the lady again

8e67fae6-bb20-4cb2-894a-ef2556eda9d8-2
01:00:25.537 --> 01:00:27.070
and she's holding that.

60acb52f-92e0-48c0-9120-f698a6ee5c9e-0
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:32.460
I don't even know what kind of
animal that you call it, but

60acb52f-92e0-48c0-9120-f698a6ee5c9e-1
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.069
it's the female version and
there's a man with a mega horn

60acb52f-92e0-48c0-9120-f698a6ee5c9e-2
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:39.800
telling him that they're going
to land and they are going to

60acb52f-92e0-48c0-9120-f698a6ee5c9e-3
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.593
land soon and they say goodbye.
These two people who just met

60acb52f-92e0-48c0-9120-f698a6ee5c9e-4
01:00:43.593 --> 01:00:45.000
the man leaves with his

14bf9023-a90a-4932-ad38-72fb083eb556-0
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:51.270
Strange looking animal and he
looks up in the sky and he sees.

c86eab9d-bd1f-4822-a45a-e0478fe038a2-0
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.720
What looks like

8bee58e3-2a34-416a-a9b2-6bec9dfe3801-0
01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:00.420
His animal, like maybe it's some
kind of strange.

2d8a7442-723f-4bb6-a6b8-d05bfac59556-0
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:06.422
Not religion, but a cult where
his animals going back to see

2d8a7442-723f-4bb6-a6b8-d05bfac59556-1
01:01:06.422 --> 01:01:09.950
the grand, the grand animal he's
going to visit.

8a2cf258-4666-4d8f-916a-c2f98865ce12-0
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:11.710
The

06f9acb7-339b-4e99-8bb3-cc363f2d6b20-0
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.280
Place where it all began, this
strange land where.

887ef43d-b9fd-4b99-b30f-88085ff71443-0
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.170
These animals.

80aa6b54-fe26-40f9-aa47-dfea48716d8d-0
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.450
Came from and the man, maybe
he's taking his animal there.

f25b469e-5f21-48fa-adb5-2d85ad31ea5c-0
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:31.517
He's walking through this town
with his animal. There's all of

f25b469e-5f21-48fa-adb5-2d85ad31ea5c-1
01:01:31.517 --> 01:01:34.704
a lot of other people with the
same kind of animal, so it's

f25b469e-5f21-48fa-adb5-2d85ad31ea5c-2
01:01:34.704 --> 01:01:35.130
probably

9fab22fb-4023-4f21-828c-a6531ed0407a-0
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.400
Probably something like that.

7b049ce8-3225-4289-b131-fd8b25525f83-0
01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:41.479
He then walks up to somewhere
where I can see like locks of

7b049ce8-3225-4289-b131-fd8b25525f83-1
01:01:41.479 --> 01:01:42.280
octopus tales.

4f2e282c-8c3b-4fe5-9f65-e2d1afd7d95c-0
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:44.740
And he.

6a7fea2e-3663-4431-a5f0-42c65d808847-0
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.233
Is talking to a man and we've
got somebody else who's trying

6a7fea2e-3663-4431-a5f0-42c65d808847-1
01:01:50.233 --> 01:01:52.370
to get a ticket to go somewhere.

544973f9-5275-4e9a-bc7f-b285650331dd-0
01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:59.061
And then we've got, uh, some,
some people looking at some like

544973f9-5275-4e9a-bc7f-b285650331dd-1
01:01:59.061 --> 01:02:01.320
dead fish, fish, skeleton.

1212e9d5-b935-49fc-8468-7333969a8af5-0
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.630
This is a very odd.

9bfc018d-e012-4c44-b14e-8225a6c46788-0
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.085
Thing to describe. next photo we
see is people still walking with

9bfc018d-e012-4c44-b14e-8225a6c46788-1
01:02:09.085 --> 01:02:11.040
animals and reading foreign.

a859acfa-9285-4a93-8ee4-39a9614f75e2-0
01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.950
Descriptions of what these
things are.

bd9e1885-c34b-4592-9d37-763a3d9101f3-0
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:22.260
And the animal is able to.

04529a21-b360-45e1-86de-2e2ece68affd-0
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.743
Relate to some scratchings on a
wall. It's like he knows his

04529a21-b360-45e1-86de-2e2ece68affd-1
01:02:29.743 --> 01:02:32.900
home. He wants to go inside the
this

41c165d5-cbb6-4a46-890b-8db3398565d2-0
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.850
Wall.

fec5c389-8448-4b1a-896e-c901ee77a84a-0
01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.851
And the man is reading a book,
trying to figure out what's

fec5c389-8448-4b1a-896e-c901ee77a84a-1
01:02:39.851 --> 01:02:43.002
going on here and inside this
wall. It's actually probably

fec5c389-8448-4b1a-896e-c901ee77a84a-2
01:02:43.002 --> 01:02:43.270
wood.

86decdcf-aece-4ff4-91c8-a60aad9769bc-0
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.170
Who knows?

90c7c190-ab27-45e9-a431-5c4b04e9c820-0
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.854
There's other animals like that
and there's a boy and the boy

90c7c190-ab27-45e9-a431-5c4b04e9c820-1
01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:54.849
saying this is where my animal
goes, this is where I keep him

90c7c190-ab27-45e9-a431-5c4b04e9c820-2
01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:59.101
and he's got a picture of of him
and another. Maybe it's the same

90c7c190-ab27-45e9-a431-5c4b04e9c820-3
01:02:59.101 --> 01:03:02.838
man, but I don't think so
because this guy has suspenders

90c7c190-ab27-45e9-a431-5c4b04e9c820-4
01:03:02.838 --> 01:03:06.640
and glasses and the other guy
doesn't. He's saying to him.

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-0
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.065
Do you want to do you want to
have have this from me? Do you

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-1
01:03:12.065 --> 01:03:16.277
want me to give you this? And
the man says, no, I want bread.

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-2
01:03:16.277 --> 01:03:19.947
He's pointing to bread in a
book. It looks like to me

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-3
01:03:19.947 --> 01:03:24.160
they're trying to communicate.
The guy with suspenders is now

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-4
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.033
part of this picture. It's
almost like they're welcoming

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-5
01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:32.382
him to a old study. An archaic
study where things are hidden in

0161918e-459c-4920-ac16-63778560bb6b-6
01:03:32.382 --> 01:03:32.790
walls.

2251fd10-530e-4be2-9e7d-f486a8f6feb7-0
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:37.763
And maybe it's it could even be
ceramics or Wicker or some

2251fd10-530e-4be2-9e7d-f486a8f6feb7-1
01:03:37.763 --> 01:03:42.378
creations that people have made,
and they store them here, that

2251fd10-530e-4be2-9e7d-f486a8f6feb7-2
01:03:42.378 --> 01:03:46.776
people don't look too sad. They
look like they're, you know,

2251fd10-530e-4be2-9e7d-f486a8f6feb7-3
01:03:46.776 --> 01:03:51.102
sharing thoughts. They now we
have the man and the guy with

2251fd10-530e-4be2-9e7d-f486a8f6feb7-4
01:03:51.102 --> 01:03:55.788
the suspenders and the young boy
talking about whatever's hidden

2251fd10-530e-4be2-9e7d-f486a8f6feb7-5
01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:56.870
in these walls.

fea3cce1-14dc-4f23-9816-ee10e7cac670-0
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:07.320
Now the guy with the suspenders
is now displaying an object. The

fea3cce1-14dc-4f23-9816-ee10e7cac670-1
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.555
little boy is also displaying an
object. And in a way they almost

fea3cce1-14dc-4f23-9816-ee10e7cac670-2
01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:15.597
look like ceramics, but I don't
know that they are. They could

fea3cce1-14dc-4f23-9816-ee10e7cac670-3
01:04:15.597 --> 01:04:15.790
be.

7ef258d6-f1bf-4105-ab7d-45e85b91e548-0
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.090
uhh philosopher.

89bbd226-98ab-4d78-a371-8c08a858b535-0
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:22.360
Fossils.

084c709e-f6e0-4b55-8f01-75aff839e62d-0
01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:28.288
It could be fossils of some
sort. And there there the boy

084c709e-f6e0-4b55-8f01-75aff839e62d-1
01:04:28.288 --> 01:04:33.292
and the man with his manners are
really getting into showing this

084c709e-f6e0-4b55-8f01-75aff839e62d-2
01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:35.340
guy what they have to show.

a9ad14ef-bdd1-4532-8829-8a603b712371-0
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:39.392
Looks like they've just had
things stored in this magic

a9ad14ef-bdd1-4532-8829-8a603b712371-1
01:04:39.392 --> 01:04:42.717
place and the and the man is
kind of confused. He's looking

a9ad14ef-bdd1-4532-8829-8a603b712371-2
01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:46.208
at this stuff like OK, well I
don't know what this is for, but

a9ad14ef-bdd1-4532-8829-8a603b712371-3
01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:49.366
thanks for showing me. And I
think what they're doing is

a9ad14ef-bdd1-4532-8829-8a603b712371-4
01:04:49.366 --> 01:04:51.140
they're going to feed is animal.

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-0
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:56.428
And then they give him, they
give him a basket of all these

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-1
01:04:56.428 --> 01:05:00.663
items that they've shown him.
Little boy is now whispering to

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-2
01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:05.035
the male in suspenders. And in a
cheerful way, like maybe we've

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-3
01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:09.133
made this man happy. We gave him
all the goods he came for,

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-4
01:05:09.133 --> 01:05:13.095
whether they be fossils,
animals, dead skeletons, I'm not

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-5
01:05:13.095 --> 01:05:17.194
sure. Paramics, I'd like to
think they were. And the little

15989589-7d30-43f5-a38b-f9663599b344-6
01:05:17.194 --> 01:05:19.379
boys pointing off to the future.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:24.338
And the next thing you know, all
three of them are walking

de16f7a9-bbe7-40e6-aaee-0f9efe7a9eb2-1
01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:28.365
towards these fantasy type
looking boats. Then the boats

de16f7a9-bbe7-40e6-aaee-0f9efe7a9eb2-2
01:05:28.365 --> 01:05:32.462
are not in the water yet,
they're just they're just there

de16f7a9-bbe7-40e6-aaee-0f9efe7a9eb2-3
01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:36.560
waiting to be used and there's
an another strange castle.

1c9f64bf-946e-4948-9e48-9a2382e82f04-0
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:39.170
This is a time that I don't know
about.

d9eaaaaf-2841-4bfd-9a41-c31b2d346f52-0
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.349
So they're walking up to one of
these boats. The little boy is

d9eaaaaf-2841-4bfd-9a41-c31b2d346f52-1
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:47.680
carrying the basket.

717379dc-03ed-4e0d-8f5a-720ada6c15ba-0
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.569
Of all the treasures that he's
going to share with this man,

717379dc-03ed-4e0d-8f5a-720ada6c15ba-1
01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:56.463
and there are animals coming
along. And the little boy says

717379dc-03ed-4e0d-8f5a-720ada6c15ba-2
01:05:56.463 --> 01:05:59.060
come, come see and out of this
ceramic.

ce5b2de8-2c0f-4187-b7ee-a11856f7ff66-0
01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:04.681
Vase rather large vase comes
like a tale of some sort, so

ce5b2de8-2c0f-4187-b7ee-a11856f7ff66-1
01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:07.200
it's a scary little pokey tail.

6360a1f0-8d87-4d44-bc35-9770e53ec01a-0
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.580
Umm.

d572ed64-b577-4e3d-b576-a94535deeac1-0
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:13.663
And turns out that this is the
boy's pet. They're telling the

d572ed64-b577-4e3d-b576-a94535deeac1-1
01:06:13.663 --> 01:06:17.720
man don't be don't be scared,
it's OK. This is our pet. And

d572ed64-b577-4e3d-b576-a94535deeac1-2
01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.170
this pet is really kind of scary
looking owl eyes.

b805e7a5-1e9e-419f-83e6-f01556099fbe-0
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.348
Um, ears stick up. And then the
man starting to take ease with

b805e7a5-1e9e-419f-83e6-f01556099fbe-1
01:06:27.348 --> 01:06:31.871
this, the other man with
suspenders, since he's kind of

b805e7a5-1e9e-419f-83e6-f01556099fbe-2
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:36.556
funny and this animal that is
this little boy's pointing,

b805e7a5-1e9e-419f-83e6-f01556099fbe-3
01:06:36.556 --> 01:06:41.483
pointing to what I call cat ears
with owl eyes is now making

b805e7a5-1e9e-419f-83e6-f01556099fbe-4
01:06:41.483 --> 01:06:42.129
friends.

9f02f933-e390-44fa-a49e-9e99533bb74f-0
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.003
With this gentleman's weird
looking animal too. So these two

9f02f933-e390-44fa-a49e-9e99533bb74f-1
01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.300
weirdly going animals are
getting together.

362a17b4-ccb4-4edf-bf46-4521fd3a6fc6-0
01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.030
And.

ef7001dc-ec6b-4002-9523-7260b4fa1906-0
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:54.587
The two gentlemen are talking
and they're going to start

ef7001dc-ec6b-4002-9523-7260b4fa1906-1
01:06:54.587 --> 01:06:58.479
drawing pictures. The one man
who's on the on the train to to

ef7001dc-ec6b-4002-9523-7260b4fa1906-2
01:06:58.479 --> 01:07:02.182
get here is drawing picture of
house with what I would say

ef7001dc-ec6b-4002-9523-7260b4fa1906-3
01:07:02.182 --> 01:07:05.760
would be like a dinosaur tail,
and he's showing the man.

e24bdb65-cb75-4265-a270-bd244466d44a-0
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.932
Man with the
suspenders and glasses is trying

e24bdb65-cb75-4265-a270-bd244466d44a-1
01:07:09.932 --> 01:07:12.961
to understand what this other
guy is getting at and he's going

e24bdb65-cb75-4265-a270-bd244466d44a-2
01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:15.893
to figure it out soon as it's
really interesting. You've got

e24bdb65-cb75-4265-a270-bd244466d44a-3
01:07:15.893 --> 01:07:18.730
this one eyeball like he's like
he's coming to understand. #END_arrival_4 

78c01350-3bba-4111-91b5-80ad2128805c-0
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.122
OK, so that was this part of
the story and we're going back

78c01350-3bba-4111-91b5-80ad2128805c-1
01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:26.750
to a complex scene.

2ec6dce9-bf4a-4692-977d-258eae45951b-0
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:29.440
OK.

fa05ab88-2f74-44ab-a814-ca92e683a63b-0
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:35.020
Sorry, one second. That's OK.

fa53ffc0-e99b-4372-8c46-a41ba761eadc-0
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.934
#START_campsite OK, this is more
like one of those complex scenes

fa53ffc0-e99b-4372-8c46-a41ba761eadc-1
01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:43.470
where it's the Waldo people
again.

a501c780-70af-46f1-be86-cef4f5f9acec-0
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:47.290
And it looks like people are
camping.

d49e49e6-25d0-446b-ab86-fd8aed8b9000-0
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:49.410
There's tents.

2727b25a-ab18-4f37-81d7-865822f32504-0
01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:56.980
There's a people socializing
outside of their tents.

1d695ecc-14dc-40e5-8ee1-64185edac760-0
01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.760
Families on blankets.

41415410-1982-4c80-a1a4-908db76fb3bb-0
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.030
Looks like some people are
cooking.

089382a9-57b5-4581-addc-726402e35286-0
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.380
Some people are playing music.

290c511b-fe64-4c9c-9ad3-54a223d115b4-0
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:06.990
I'd say there's about.

86badbb6-d282-4f5d-b870-aa51bf6ddf07-0
01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.822
I don't know, maybe a dozen
tents, but the one tent is

86badbb6-d282-4f5d-b870-aa51bf6ddf07-1
01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:16.453
caught my eye is like a hippie
tent. It's got flowers like and

86badbb6-d282-4f5d-b870-aa51bf6ddf07-2
01:08:16.453 --> 01:08:21.084
the people hanging around it,
they have a guitar and they have

86badbb6-d282-4f5d-b870-aa51bf6ddf07-3
01:08:21.084 --> 01:08:21.820
long hair.

820fa21c-40c3-4fea-a207-38db2c7d08a3-0
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:27.342
Maybe it's if I had enough time
to figure it out. Each tent

820fa21c-40c3-4fea-a207-38db2c7d08a3-1
01:08:27.342 --> 01:08:31.464
represents something different
in the world, you know? But

820fa21c-40c3-4fea-a207-38db2c7d08a3-2
01:08:31.464 --> 01:08:36.075
alongside of this is interesting
too, because we've got some farm

820fa21c-40c3-4fea-a207-38db2c7d08a3-3
01:08:36.075 --> 01:08:39.009
animals. Actually, I think that
might be.

5d2194b2-6376-4890-a140-c90f3ba81c6f-0
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.520
Ah, what is it called?

56e24228-5438-4a65-9116-b07dcf627b4f-0
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:47.034
A bull. You could see the smoke
coming out of his nose and for

56e24228-5438-4a65-9116-b07dcf627b4f-1
01:08:47.034 --> 01:08:51.110
whatever reason people are
actually looks like near him.

fac0dd49-7080-4ed1-bf5f-aff9aa67db2d-0
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:55.732
Other people are just walking
along with their walking sticks

fac0dd49-7080-4ed1-bf5f-aff9aa67db2d-1
01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:59.000
and their backpacks. There's
cement, there's pathways.

8976cc30-1f17-40a8-b058-1e2058251e7e-0
01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:05.492
And there's a big thing of water
that separates another side of

8976cc30-1f17-40a8-b058-1e2058251e7e-1
01:09:05.492 --> 01:09:06.220
camping.

dd8a1031-0ce9-48e8-a327-6d474ea15c71-0
01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:12.703
This other side of camping is
more structured. It is not

dd8a1031-0ce9-48e8-a327-6d474ea15c71-1
01:09:12.703 --> 01:09:15.490
tents, it is more like trailers.

7b78e86d-13f2-4c58-a957-a07d4f1b852f-0
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:18.850
Much more sturdy.

efd16b8f-e4cd-426b-aef2-96e867827b1a-0
01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.460
There.

c2029de7-b37b-4943-aa30-33c3cc444af5-0
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.537
Vehicles, they're on wheels,
they have awnings. They have

c2029de7-b37b-4943-aa30-33c3cc444af5-1
01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:29.857
looks like they probably have
electricity. They've got maybe a

c2029de7-b37b-4943-aa30-33c3cc444af5-2
01:09:29.857 --> 01:09:34.178
bathroom, maybe a bed inside.
It's definitely different on the

c2029de7-b37b-4943-aa30-33c3cc444af5-3
01:09:34.178 --> 01:09:38.567
other side of the bridge or the
other side of the water. It's a

c2029de7-b37b-4943-aa30-33c3cc444af5-4
01:09:38.567 --> 01:09:40.350
different type of camping.

6b00976c-6e0a-4ddc-878c-a89d06079c65-0
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:46.310
And I can see some Boy Scouts,
look at some Boy Scouts on that

6b00976c-6e0a-4ddc-878c-a89d06079c65-1
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.810
side. People are fishing.

6e38ac45-70cf-466d-af8d-84ec46f741cf-0
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:50.910
People riding bicycles.

40b7c2a7-efc0-4fbe-a331-144e27bc4fa1-0
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.570
People are taking jogs.

3ed3b7db-e3b8-4e1a-9189-ace0b4d808dc-0
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.650
It's green. It's green in both
places.

2277e24b-e55d-4dd8-be16-0193a9f33db4-0
01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:01.947
That the primary difference I
think, besides the fact that

2277e24b-e55d-4dd8-be16-0193a9f33db4-1
01:10:01.947 --> 01:10:03.910
that the river there's a bridge.

f65f3243-f12f-4212-929d-3cbd84897eb5-0
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:09.918
And people on a party boat in
the river and fishing over the

f65f3243-f12f-4212-929d-3cbd84897eb5-1
01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:11.460
river for mermaids.

25fa3a67-b929-453b-8178-5d9337b38825-0
01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:18.327
Yeah, I'd say that
that that stands out to me that

25fa3a67-b929-453b-8178-5d9337b38825-1
01:10:18.327 --> 01:10:21.815
there's the type of of mobile
homes or whatever that they're

25fa3a67-b929-453b-8178-5d9337b38825-2
01:10:21.815 --> 01:10:23.360
staying and it's different. #END_campsite 

1f9791c3-5ce2-48d0-b695-1841927f4cae-0
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.330
That was about 3 minutes.

a1fa90b6-8653-4923-8436-4cc026249323-0
01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:33.030
And then moving on to the next
one.

5c900d02-ce98-4062-a0f3-3ad260e47926-0
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.130
I'm reading this a drop so I can
have an idea. OK.

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-0
01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.228
#START_birthday_party_fun OK,
well, we're at a birthday party

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-1
01:10:49.228 --> 01:10:53.923
for some somebody and you've got
to jumpy gym with all sorts of

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-2
01:10:53.923 --> 01:10:58.251
dressed up kids are in costume,
they're jumpy gym. They're

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-3
01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:02.726
wearing, I don't know, one guys
dressed up like a alligator.

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-4
01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:06.834
Another one is a monster.
There's a pink Bunny, there's

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-5
01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:11.015
some. It's like Halloween
basically. They're all wearing

7a2a0373-7cf9-48c4-b1af-2da6bbac3805-6
01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:14.610
different costumes. You've got
ghosts you've got

6334446f-b68a-45c4-97b3-48f52abf6be0-0
01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:19.626
Goblins. You've got the people
that look like they're the

6334446f-b68a-45c4-97b3-48f52abf6be0-1
01:11:19.626 --> 01:11:25.158
Vikings. You got animals eating
from the table was probably just

6334446f-b68a-45c4-97b3-48f52abf6be0-2
01:11:25.158 --> 01:11:30.520
someone in the costume. You've
got water play at this birthday

6334446f-b68a-45c4-97b3-48f52abf6be0-3
01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.797
party. There's balloons. There's
a man in his tall hat with a

6334446f-b68a-45c4-97b3-48f52abf6be0-4
01:11:35.797 --> 01:11:37.330
it's a gift table.

037b5415-c3de-478d-8731-ed210553fab8-0
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:42.308
There's a pinata, there's a lady
looking over the fence. She

037b5415-c3de-478d-8731-ed210553fab8-1
01:11:42.308 --> 01:11:44.930
probably wasn't invited, but
wants to be.

a10ad91e-ee7f-49cd-9159-54174ab1ba0e-0
01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.248
They're like the jumpy gym is
like I said, there's a lot of

a10ad91e-ee7f-49cd-9159-54174ab1ba0e-1
01:11:50.248 --> 01:11:52.740
activity around the gym. Kids
are chasing each other.

c122a27a-b4e8-4cd0-8ea4-0e0db742259d-0
01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:57.340
There's a guy that's dressed
like Superman.

3145db2f-6583-493f-8e85-12b1b2edb3fc-0
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.034
And I think, I think I mentioned
the water play. There's people

3145db2f-6583-493f-8e85-12b1b2edb3fc-1
01:12:03.034 --> 01:12:07.585
in a big pool of water, one of
those that sits on the ground

3145db2f-6583-493f-8e85-12b1b2edb3fc-2
01:12:07.585 --> 01:12:12.285
and they're, they're spraying
each other with water. There's a

3145db2f-6583-493f-8e85-12b1b2edb3fc-3
01:12:12.285 --> 01:12:14.300
witch, there's a butterfly.

3ca27565-aa31-427d-a8b8-e27b16f95dfa-0
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:16.040
And.

ec57fd76-f254-4465-8ade-bdf45ad35190-0
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:21.697
The gift table. The food table.
Somebody's bringing a cake.

ec57fd76-f254-4465-8ade-bdf45ad35190-1
01:12:21.697 --> 01:12:22.900
There's pirates.

969a20e9-e701-4525-a1fc-0f7fa7e2d243-0
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.460
There's a I already mentioned
the pinata.

56d348bd-77e2-409c-b352-3a8a31873e9e-0
01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:27.560
Now.

bb53ebb9-85e8-4907-881c-43e5a20720bc-0
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.712
Just just a variety of costumes
and people having a good time

bb53ebb9-85e8-4907-881c-43e5a20720bc-1
01:12:34.712 --> 01:12:38.006
with this birthday party.
There's a somebody's dressed

bb53ebb9-85e8-4907-881c-43e5a20720bc-2
01:12:38.006 --> 01:12:41.420
like Fred Flintstone. There's
people playing tug of war.

bb1c7083-d0e4-42d4-babf-c3e8787ba0df-0
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:46.180
Let's see what else.

e0adea53-fa7d-4a7b-9d43-fd956df3e1e8-0
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.090


eed07ae2-2c30-44c3-8c49-1b56f3317c67-0
01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.751
That's about all I can say.
Well, I mean, I could keep

eed07ae2-2c30-44c3-8c49-1b56f3317c67-1
01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:53.190
going, but.

99f1e095-5ca1-4a04-900b-c1eaa13145c3-0
01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.760
There's people entering with
gifts.

40dbdf03-dff0-406a-a366-aa2de8bf9c4a-0
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.763
I don't know who the birthday
person is. Oh, there's a clown

40dbdf03-dff0-406a-a366-aa2de8bf9c4a-1
01:13:02.763 --> 01:13:03.390
and a mummy.

e356293e-f4ed-47c3-8f1b-8cef378950f7-0
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:08.126
{And I}
and somebody is dressed like a

e356293e-f4ed-47c3-8f1b-8cef378950f7-1
01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:10.928
strawberry or a Raspberry or
something. Yeah, Oh yeah. And

e356293e-f4ed-47c3-8f1b-8cef378950f7-2
01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:13.825
there's a robot and there's
another clown and stretched out.

e356293e-f4ed-47c3-8f1b-8cef378950f7-3
01:13:13.825 --> 01:13:14.870
And there's Cleopatra. #END_birthday_party_fun 

f10a6b5d-d296-4f7e-b997-77f95cddfc54-0
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:22.160
OK, good. So you can go on to
the next one.

62bd8283-9bb1-4df9-8e63-3cb36ed0905c-0
01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.450
Something different.

fdcba57f-3f8a-448e-83c8-a2042c69111f-0
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:27.130
OK.

a88a3c0a-f1b9-4004-a307-953de98e688e-0
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.310
All right.

7a0da2d9-a6c3-4762-96c3-b19d0dcaef42-0
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:34.355
#START_ancient_rome Well, this I
can see is what they're going to

7a0da2d9-a6c3-4762-96c3-b19d0dcaef42-1
01:13:34.355 --> 01:13:37.700
call fun and games in ancient
Rome, 2000 years ago.

0d8e98b9-47e1-40a5-93f2-826a62e1b630-0
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:42.508
{Sounds like some of my my
husband would say fun and games.

0d8e98b9-47e1-40a5-93f2-826a62e1b630-1
01:13:42.508 --> 01:13:45.120
Everything is fun. Stuff this
fun fun.}

c5b85f3a-f1d2-457f-9bac-19b4e193b632-0
01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.610
This is ancient Rome. Again, I'm
not going to know all that much.

4574c854-9225-4cc9-94b3-1c1722ea2cb2-0
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.717
You know, to describe it too
much the but I can tell you it's

4574c854-9225-4cc9-94b3-1c1722ea2cb2-1
01:13:58.717 --> 01:13:59.290
a big uh

8e526093-6684-4531-9dd1-cb64425ac143-0
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:07.588
Arena where there's people
fighting animals and people

8e526093-6684-4531-9dd1-cb64425ac143-1
01:14:07.588 --> 01:14:12.300
fighting each other with swords
and

f1561610-2af8-4aff-bdd4-7f002f897983-0
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:15.460
Protective devices.

c2331b59-3e64-4098-8ea9-f036b47a70a3-0
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:21.360
Um, there's horse buggy. Not
buggy and carriage, but horses.

f2cd48e8-bb82-4ce4-9d3b-b65d986e6cfd-0
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:27.200
Uh, there's men pulling horses.

31043a9f-9ad9-4534-91d5-17ee0575037a-0
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.506
It's not a really good time in
the world. I mean, it's people,

31043a9f-9ad9-4534-91d5-17ee0575037a-1
01:14:30.506 --> 01:14:33.043
they're spectators. That's the
thing that's really annoying. I

31043a9f-9ad9-4534-91d5-17ee0575037a-2
01:14:33.043 --> 01:14:34.049
mean, these people would.

9708ffee-df21-4aad-a1d4-7e0b74ba365a-0
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.707
Or bothersome, let's call it
bothersome. People are actually

9708ffee-df21-4aad-a1d4-7e0b74ba365a-1
01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:39.690
watching all this

3b95f83b-3cef-4eea-b738-b2686d1ac880-0
01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:47.040
Violence, I'd say. And they
think it's a game.

ed17f5ae-84e0-4194-9550-20d352e2ed81-0
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.530
But it it's that's what they
watched. And they had animals

ed17f5ae-84e0-4194-9550-20d352e2ed81-1
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:54.962
chasing after people and it was
their entertainment. Very

ed17f5ae-84e0-4194-9550-20d352e2ed81-2
01:14:54.962 --> 01:14:58.512
strange, very strange times. But
yeah, we got people in the

ed17f5ae-84e0-4194-9550-20d352e2ed81-3
01:14:58.512 --> 01:15:02.299
audience cheering them on. And
the weird thing is, the audience

ed17f5ae-84e0-4194-9550-20d352e2ed81-4
01:15:02.299 --> 01:15:04.370
is dressed in modern day
clothing.

456e409f-0423-464f-a181-8e97b163b18e-0
01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:12.460
Yeah, and I can just see people
being dragged off, people being

456e409f-0423-464f-a181-8e97b163b18e-1
01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.860
chased by lions.

2be4d15c-958b-48a3-9d9b-96e007cb90bb-0
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:18.260
You can see the where the lines
come out of the structure and

2be4d15c-958b-48a3-9d9b-96e007cb90bb-1
01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.715
attack the people. Lions are
even going into the audience.

2be4d15c-958b-48a3-9d9b-96e007cb90bb-2
01:15:21.715 --> 01:15:22.770
Now wait a minute.

b07e110c-d1fb-4439-8e54-939e3e6be5ae-0
01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:25.890
On the other side of the
audience, you can see.

7695e65b-d651-459b-927e-1f224be55d5e-0
01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:27.580
People are running.

057b6b5d-fece-4e7f-b8ee-5ac0d85a097a-0
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:31.899
The Lions are going crazy.
They're like climbing up each on

057b6b5d-fece-4e7f-b8ee-5ac0d85a097a-1
01:15:31.899 --> 01:15:35.548
each other, like cheerleaders
do, you know how they make the

057b6b5d-fece-4e7f-b8ee-5ac0d85a097a-2
01:15:35.548 --> 01:15:38.240
little pyramid the the the lions
are getting

96217a1f-e17d-45f5-bb0b-82c1acfbb987-0
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:42.471
Uh, they're chasing after the
people on the other side of the

96217a1f-e17d-45f5-bb0b-82c1acfbb987-1
01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:45.880
arena, and then we've got people
that are like the Trojans.

0b3e9e53-2488-4a1e-af42-96a068046574-0
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.050
Watching over.

3e65c745-0d15-47ff-bef3-58ff1090a305-0
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.330
Yeah.

a2c6c0d9-d893-44e7-9252-9a29ad880430-0
01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.970
Some people are running.

f1e91ecb-0110-4af6-8c27-cc80a1b85ffb-0
01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.990
Oh, here's a funny one. I see a
lion with a

dd310e7c-179a-4eaf-ab58-e829e556963b-0
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.046
Bib and what looks like a knife
and fork getting ready to eat

dd310e7c-179a-4eaf-ab58-e829e556963b-1
01:16:06.046 --> 01:16:10.050
somebody in that's sitting in a
in a child's waiting pool.

cd8dfdf3-1d42-480b-a7d8-588ccbf2be3c-0
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.860
Ah, Yep.

c81e4489-ba63-45a5-9ea6-60f03e82635a-0
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.830
There's a lot of stuff going on here. #END_ancient_rome 

2fef3ab5-842a-4742-9a31-dc8aefb5ab95-0
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:24.833
Hey, that was again about 3
minutes and we can move on. So

2fef3ab5-842a-4742-9a31-dc8aefb5ab95-1
01:16:24.833 --> 01:16:29.167
this one is a graphic novel
again. Just describe what you

2fef3ab5-842a-4742-9a31-dc8aefb5ab95-2
01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:33.949
see, what is happening as you go
through the story. This one is

2fef3ab5-842a-4742-9a31-dc8aefb5ab95-3
01:16:33.949 --> 01:16:35.070
about 6 pages.

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:37.270
OK.

7b06b3d8-4781-488a-afaa-08406332b924-0
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:43.460
#START_arrival_6 What I see is a
small

ffda0281-aaef-472d-847f-83b1b3f9169d-0
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.720
Ceramic looks like a cup.

a1e04df7-321c-4477-a9dc-924302c8ae2e-0
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:50.310
And.

491bb328-644c-4386-8bce-bf04c3acede7-0
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:58.000
I can't tell what that is, but
it looks this paper.

dd2f454e-43e8-498c-a700-b6b33999c426-0
01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:04.633
Paper towards the cup and the
man is sitting and writing a

dd2f454e-43e8-498c-a700-b6b33999c426-1
01:17:04.633 --> 01:17:08.782
letter with this cup in front of
him. Looks like it might be

dd2f454e-43e8-498c-a700-b6b33999c426-2
01:17:08.782 --> 01:17:13.271
holding up like a flower of some
sort, but the main thing is that

dd2f454e-43e8-498c-a700-b6b33999c426-3
01:17:13.271 --> 01:17:15.040
he's using a fountain pen.

0ba3ae17-62d6-4071-b7c4-d7ab9af4f337-0
01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.070
He's got some money.

413b3d7d-167b-43bf-83d4-86fd2183785f-0
01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.340
And he's writing a letter.

aa824ebd-793e-413c-bead-573a6f3bbfee-0
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.393
And he's going to fold this
letter up into like a bird

aa824ebd-793e-413c-bead-573a6f3bbfee-1
01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:26.537
shape, and he's going to put
that bird in the mail. He's

aa824ebd-793e-413c-bead-573a6f3bbfee-2
01:17:26.537 --> 01:17:29.240
putting that in an envelope and
with some money.

847b1786-16a0-4eb7-8134-d212cda11313-0
01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:33.037
And then he's going to seal the
envelope and he's putting his

847b1786-16a0-4eb7-8134-d212cda11313-1
01:17:33.037 --> 01:17:35.967
stamp on it. It's this is the
same man I think as before

847b1786-16a0-4eb7-8134-d212cda11313-2
01:17:35.967 --> 01:17:39.309
because he's got that same weird
animal, the one that looks like

847b1786-16a0-4eb7-8134-d212cda11313-3
01:17:39.309 --> 01:17:42.548
a mouse, but it's got a really
long tail in the mouth. This is

847b1786-16a0-4eb7-8134-d212cda11313-4
01:17:42.548 --> 01:17:44.810
like a blown up mouse. I mean
this is like.

6b42643b-8912-4fbd-9635-a1f9c9a9e45f-0
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:50.403
And big mouse. So he stops to
ask the lady where he can mail

6b42643b-8912-4fbd-9635-a1f9c9a9e45f-1
01:17:50.403 --> 01:17:54.595
the letter and she tells him to
go over to this what I guess was

6b42643b-8912-4fbd-9635-a1f9c9a9e45f-2
01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:58.594
a mailbox back in in this time
frame. And he punches a couple

6b42643b-8912-4fbd-9635-a1f9c9a9e45f-3
01:17:58.594 --> 01:18:02.270
of codes, read something and
opens it up and puts letter

6b42643b-8912-4fbd-9635-a1f9c9a9e45f-4
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:06.333
inside and looks up in the sky
and says I sure hope it gets to

6b42643b-8912-4fbd-9635-a1f9c9a9e45f-5
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:08.010
where it's supposed to go.

a86e2f5e-41f1-40b9-905e-4f9e8ef19cb6-0
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:15.940
And that's what we'll see so
far. And then what he sees is a

a86e2f5e-41f1-40b9-905e-4f9e8ef19cb6-1
01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:21.020
leaf in what would probably be
winter, a very cold time. The

a86e2f5e-41f1-40b9-905e-4f9e8ef19cb6-2
01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.020
leaf is now.

03cb3047-869b-425b-a505-fe39bc360127-0
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.576
I don't know if he sees this,
but I see this. The leaf is

03cb3047-869b-425b-a505-fe39bc360127-1
01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:27.200
splitting.

0042197f-cf14-44bc-b8cd-d77dceff9143-0
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.789
Um, if we go all the way across
the page, you can see all of the

0042197f-cf14-44bc-b8cd-d77dceff9143-1
01:18:31.789 --> 01:18:34.422
changes in this leaf. It's
splitting up, it's

0042197f-cf14-44bc-b8cd-d77dceff9143-2
01:18:34.422 --> 01:18:37.569
metamorphosizing and it's
becoming something else that

0042197f-cf14-44bc-b8cd-d77dceff9143-3
01:18:37.569 --> 01:18:40.946
that's really quite beautiful.
At the tail end of this, it

0042197f-cf14-44bc-b8cd-d77dceff9143-4
01:18:40.946 --> 01:18:43.350
looks like it's got a crystal on
top and.

36553aa6-22bd-4f36-a5ef-b2cf585586e5-0
01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:47.750
It's fully formed into a
beautiful

aa6e8078-36e5-40a7-bfa0-bd7a61fe0795-0
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.981
Changed Leaf and it's like that.
On all these there's four rows

aa6e8078-36e5-40a7-bfa0-bd7a61fe0795-1
01:18:53.981 --> 01:18:58.445
of these pictures that show
that. Seems to me it's just the

aa6e8078-36e5-40a7-bfa0-bd7a61fe0795-2
01:18:58.445 --> 01:19:00.380
changing of some object of

6765e027-e568-45fb-9a88-9f83f5476be4-0
01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.479
The world, the second one looks
like a dandelion because you can

6765e027-e568-45fb-9a88-9f83f5476be4-1
01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:09.408
see that it starts out and then
it gets it's puffs. The puffs

6765e027-e568-45fb-9a88-9f83f5476be4-2
01:19:09.408 --> 01:19:12.260
start to fly into the sky and
then it comes.

4fa8d679-f503-4760-98ef-e1984c6c314e-0
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:17.388
You know, just solitude again.
It doesn't have its feathers or

4fa8d679-f503-4760-98ef-e1984c6c314e-1
01:19:17.388 --> 01:19:21.350
whatever. Those things are
called wisps of the dandelion

4fa8d679-f503-4760-98ef-e1984c6c314e-2
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:25.520
leafs. And the third one, it
looks the same. It's changing.

4587381c-d68b-4260-8077-eb79e09282b3-0
01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:30.140
Looks like a flower of some sort
or

1d14e2ec-12e1-4886-877f-8c445988e092-0
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.835
You know even a even a cookie on
a stick. But or tree could be a

1d14e2ec-12e1-4886-877f-8c445988e092-1
01:19:36.835 --> 01:19:42.571
tree anyways. It's nature. It's
nature changing and coming to to

1d14e2ec-12e1-4886-877f-8c445988e092-2
01:19:42.571 --> 01:19:43.630
some either.

2688312c-f7fb-4ca3-9405-7565f924f2b0-0
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.122
Some of them are coming to
growth and this third one I'm

2688312c-f7fb-4ca3-9405-7565f924f2b0-1
01:19:48.122 --> 01:19:51.876
seeing is coming towards an end.
It's all dark at the end. It's

2688312c-f7fb-4ca3-9405-7565f924f2b0-2
01:19:51.876 --> 01:19:55.278
like the end of it's evolution
and the very last one goes

2688312c-f7fb-4ca3-9405-7565f924f2b0-3
01:19:55.278 --> 01:19:58.797
opposite direction where it
starts out pretty dark and then

2688312c-f7fb-4ca3-9405-7565f924f2b0-4
01:19:58.797 --> 01:19:59.970
it loses some of its

f61da6a9-c96d-4836-bb29-e70052fe4848-0
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.924
Obscurity. It opens up more and
more and more and then it

f61da6a9-c96d-4836-bb29-e70052fe4848-1
01:20:05.924 --> 01:20:10.047
becomes almost like almost like.
I guess I'll describe it as like

f61da6a9-c96d-4836-bb29-e70052fe4848-2
01:20:10.047 --> 01:20:11.609
a paper clip or a string.

2cb13df1-610c-4a8d-85db-677405eaad4f-0
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.661
Oh, dream catcher. Like that
thing where you can blow things

2cb13df1-610c-4a8d-85db-677405eaad4f-1
01:20:17.661 --> 01:20:21.923
through something. But at first
it wasn't like that. It was. So

2cb13df1-610c-4a8d-85db-677405eaad4f-2
01:20:21.923 --> 01:20:25.852
I think it's just changing,
changing life, evolution of an

2cb13df1-610c-4a8d-85db-677405eaad4f-3
01:20:25.852 --> 01:20:27.650
object, nature or just art.

f75e8ee1-1b60-41d6-a2d8-fbd0f7c33b82-0
01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.750
Of beginnings and endings.

ae4b872d-f75e-4f11-b523-93b4965c2979-0
01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:36.844
OK, so I don't know how this
those other pages relate to

ae4b872d-f75e-4f11-b523-93b4965c2979-1
01:20:36.844 --> 01:20:38.460
this, but we've got.

895eb40f-4294-4e6b-9e5f-e4fe56b34f6f-0
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.450
What looks like a cold day.

c3e50429-1199-4abe-b85d-d387d01156f8-0
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.410
in some.

cd5f32ba-def1-4b23-906e-f80d7f84f1fb-0
01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:50.120
I think it's a fantasy world.
Can't be sure.

46687d35-8905-4369-9e1a-cd573f1f0df4-0
01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:56.007
It's hard to tell what this is,
gosh darn it. Big cement

46687d35-8905-4369-9e1a-cd573f1f0df4-1
01:20:56.007 --> 01:21:01.273
building, probably a Moat around
this building that may be frozen

46687d35-8905-4369-9e1a-cd573f1f0df4-2
01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:06.380
right now. Looks like I can see
the spaceship again. And maybe.

44fe7160-9022-4049-9a0d-e04c6e3c08fc-0
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.040
Umm.

4c6b81dd-027f-4a92-b007-d09acf657971-0
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:11.100
Some kind of.

49be9da5-9118-4d94-a783-f25ee95481ba-0
01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:17.659
There's the, the pine, the tipi,
tipi again. And this might be, I

49be9da5-9118-4d94-a783-f25ee95481ba-1
01:21:17.659 --> 01:21:22.720
mean, if you really want me, I
could say it looks like an

49be9da5-9118-4d94-a783-f25ee95481ba-2
01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.956
Indian burial ground. He's got
some pottery and some things

49be9da5-9118-4d94-a783-f25ee95481ba-3
01:21:27.956 --> 01:21:33.192
that looks like Indianish would
be in the background there.

49be9da5-9118-4d94-a783-f25ee95481ba-4
01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:38.253
Yeah, it's hard to tell, but
it's very hilly and it looks

49be9da5-9118-4d94-a783-f25ee95481ba-5
01:21:38.253 --> 01:21:38.689
cold.

b5f5997b-208f-4f3d-a08d-ceb1a2fe9c1b-0
01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.256
OK, so back to what we have is a
ceramic dish and it looks like

b5f5997b-208f-4f3d-a08d-ceb1a2fe9c1b-1
01:21:47.256 --> 01:21:51.845
somebody's come a bird or some
kind of object is coming in to

b5f5997b-208f-4f3d-a08d-ceb1a2fe9c1b-2
01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:53.770
get food out of this dish.

2af74c21-3389-45da-9725-f2ee19a6234c-0
01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.656
And this is another fantasy
animal, more like it's but it

2af74c21-3389-45da-9725-f2ee19a6234c-1
01:21:59.656 --> 01:22:04.472
flies. It's not like the one on
the not like the mouse. This one

2af74c21-3389-45da-9725-f2ee19a6234c-2
01:22:04.472 --> 01:22:07.510
flies and we are now seeing this
flying.

214008e5-a290-460b-ac68-f0a11a9bbda0-0
01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.774
Bird like animal, uh, going to
eat out of that ceramic dish.

214008e5-a290-460b-ac68-f0a11a9bbda0-1
01:22:12.774 --> 01:22:15.450
And there's a man sitting on his
bed.

a12ac684-b9d3-47ad-a6c5-218be501ff7b-0
01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.843
Looking at a family photo while
this is sitting on his

a12ac684-b9d3-47ad-a6c5-218be501ff7b-1
01:22:20.843 --> 01:22:21.720
windowsill.

365205c8-c299-4490-86e4-5fba689bba4e-0
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.020
And.

14d18d4b-64b0-466e-9efd-d16ea0cf5263-0
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.650
His.

50bc3a12-2aa4-46c9-a605-dfebb5f322bb-0
01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.395
Animal that looked like the
mouse is now in the picture

50bc3a12-2aa4-46c9-a605-dfebb5f322bb-1
01:22:29.395 --> 01:22:29.680
again.

978b808c-8810-4e60-ba00-335ac49400f0-0
01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:34.328
Looks like it's noticing
something's going on. It's like

978b808c-8810-4e60-ba00-335ac49400f0-1
01:22:34.328 --> 01:22:37.884
very in tune with something
happening and the man stops

978b808c-8810-4e60-ba00-335ac49400f0-2
01:22:37.884 --> 01:22:41.502
looking at his picture and sees
that his animal is going

978b808c-8810-4e60-ba00-335ac49400f0-3
01:22:41.502 --> 01:22:43.090
downstairs down a ladder.

40fffb05-93e9-4c92-8360-4050f937fe35-0
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:48.226
He goes down the ladder to find
him, and it turns out this

40fffb05-93e9-4c92-8360-4050f937fe35-1
01:22:48.226 --> 01:22:51.010
animal is the recipient of that
letter.

32ca7969-9e3b-4858-ad9c-b72312b61cd0-0
01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:56.210
The letter that the other man
had mailed? It looks like so.

6c3fca89-d498-4c8b-8a1d-4f47a0c81e0d-0
01:22:57.170 --> 01:22:59.340
The human being opens the
letter.

07c78aea-628f-4ba2-a2fe-73db2249bffc-0
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:01.440
And.

72e31bf3-48ca-4818-9d9b-d1b5076004bc-0
01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.347
He pulls out the paper mache
bird that has the letter from

72e31bf3-48ca-4818-9d9b-d1b5076004bc-1
01:23:06.347 --> 01:23:10.340
his friend. Maybe it was his
brother's uncle's good friend,

72e31bf3-48ca-4818-9d9b-d1b5076004bc-2
01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:14.600
and he's reading the letter and
he's looking out in the sky out

72e31bf3-48ca-4818-9d9b-d1b5076004bc-3
01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.993
of his window, as if this person
had, you know, he had written to

72e31bf3-48ca-4818-9d9b-d1b5076004bc-4
01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:19.260
him.

2b939967-d289-42c0-908e-8da00fb5ddaa-0
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:25.461
And I don't know if he's in jail
or what, but we got to summarize

2b939967-d289-42c0-908e-8da00fb5ddaa-1
01:23:25.461 --> 01:23:27.690
this now with the little paper

6ed1fc9a-a762-436a-8818-834d76e92e1a-0
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.080
Origami.

f291bac2-046e-4cc1-9c3d-0efa46b3ee9a-0
01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:33.820
Feeding

fb687256-46f6-4adf-b6b9-4a8a4b6aba41-0
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:39.640
Item one that was feeding, then
we've got it looks like, like I

fb687256-46f6-4adf-b6b9-4a8a4b6aba41-1
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.814
said, an Indian kind of
contraption where you keep your

fb687256-46f6-4adf-b6b9-4a8a4b6aba41-2
01:23:43.814 --> 01:23:48.211
dishes, you got the man's,
somebody's one of the man's hat

fb687256-46f6-4adf-b6b9-4a8a4b6aba41-3
01:23:48.211 --> 01:23:51.640
and cloak, then you've got a
picture of that.

d0fe5c03-718d-481f-8cbd-762b56adca1d-0
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.610
octopus thing that was coming
in.

0c893373-a8d6-4536-89ff-4fdfc7f9fb95-0
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:01.080
Uh, looks like children's
drawings.

bd70e9f5-f34d-423f-93e8-65668a3d1b58-0
01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:03.170
And.

6480dfc7-9358-4109-b731-2540845e9282-0
01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.569
I I don't know. I go, it's like
a coffee maker and the guy's

6480dfc7-9358-4109-b731-2540845e9282-1
01:24:07.569 --> 01:24:10.939
going to have a cup of coffee
and he's going to look at this

6480dfc7-9358-4109-b731-2540845e9282-2
01:24:10.939 --> 01:24:14.088
photo of his family and he's
going to give somebody some

6480dfc7-9358-4109-b731-2540845e9282-3
01:24:14.088 --> 01:24:14.420
money.

ae1fedcb-e417-45ab-a81d-a290728d507c-0
01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:21.771
Now we go to open up this whole
picture. Now we're going to see

ae1fedcb-e417-45ab-a81d-a290728d507c-1
01:24:21.771 --> 01:24:26.511
the whole picture again. It's
kind of like going back to a

ae1fedcb-e417-45ab-a81d-a290728d507c-2
01:24:26.511 --> 01:24:31.492
little bit like going back to
last session where it's a sepia

ae1fedcb-e417-45ab-a81d-a290728d507c-3
01:24:31.492 --> 01:24:36.312
looking family at a table. All
the things that we've talked

ae1fedcb-e417-45ab-a81d-a290728d507c-4
01:24:36.312 --> 01:24:41.373
about are in this picture. The
hat, the neckerchief, the photo

ae1fedcb-e417-45ab-a81d-a290728d507c-5
01:24:41.373 --> 01:24:45.389
of the family, the origami,
whatever that is the.

95febd32-9ba0-47d0-84bd-c8b7bae79b3b-0
01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.870
Mouse. Mouse. Animal, child.

975139ee-129e-4dae-9cce-e2b729dc4f69-0
01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.703
Mother and a father, and they're
also talking about 3 for some

975139ee-129e-4dae-9cce-e2b729dc4f69-1
01:24:54.703 --> 01:24:58.565
reason. So the little girl looks
like she's putting on her boots

975139ee-129e-4dae-9cce-e2b729dc4f69-2
01:24:58.565 --> 01:25:02.250
and she's going to take that
mouse looking animal for a walk.

4d894c26-a5d6-4ab0-a221-24954deefd42-0
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.879
And she's all bundled up and
they go outside in this magic

4d894c26-a5d6-4ab0-a221-24954deefd42-1
01:25:09.879 --> 01:25:10.530
world.

ae72b01b-4e6f-446c-be68-2e7554906e3e-0
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:14.267
And they're
running. And then she shows the

ae72b01b-4e6f-446c-be68-2e7554906e3e-1
01:25:14.267 --> 01:25:17.028
animal these little bright
things on the ground, and she

ae72b01b-4e6f-446c-be68-2e7554906e3e-2
01:25:17.028 --> 01:25:20.225
lifts someone up and she's going
to toss it in the air and that's

ae72b01b-4e6f-446c-be68-2e7554906e3e-3
01:25:20.225 --> 01:25:22.260
I don't know what's going to
happen next. #END_arrival_6 

3e2a96fb-c731-4441-8c77-2b6b81eacbc9-0
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:28.922
This part of the story. So OK,
yeah that was it's own part and

3e2a96fb-c731-4441-8c77-2b6b81eacbc9-1
01:25:28.922 --> 01:25:34.074
we can the next one is a complex
scene. So again describe what

3e2a96fb-c731-4441-8c77-2b6b81eacbc9-2
01:25:34.074 --> 01:25:34.810
you see.

865c07e4-d564-4526-83d2-5991d8502f73-0
01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:36.910
OK.

3731883e-72c1-4e01-9fe4-4c8d842366e9-0
01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:40.000
#START_waldo_1 I see another
Waldo.

0f7f7fbc-425f-423b-a926-36f5c35133b1-0
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.060
Caricature.

24e088bb-2761-4f7e-a965-995fa708dbbb-0
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.859
Lots of bigger buildings this
time around. OK, it's not. This

24e088bb-2761-4f7e-a965-995fa708dbbb-1
01:25:47.859 --> 01:25:49.270
picture is not so.

c91b98c5-5885-4846-bf64-34e8a7f6cf18-0
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.530
I don't know what to say.

d8c98a2f-9592-4a89-ae07-a7a2dcdb0f4b-0
01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:08.693
It looks like there's an adult
in charge there and there's a

d8c98a2f-9592-4a89-ae07-a7a2dcdb0f4b-1
01:26:08.693 --> 01:26:13.673
car in the street and two cars,
people crossing the street.

d8c98a2f-9592-4a89-ae07-a7a2dcdb0f4b-2
01:26:13.673 --> 01:26:18.902
There's a looks like a a nurse,
probably hospital trash truck.

d8c98a2f-9592-4a89-ae07-a7a2dcdb0f4b-3
01:26:18.902 --> 01:26:23.965
It's like a normal community.
There's a fire station next to

d8c98a2f-9592-4a89-ae07-a7a2dcdb0f4b-4
01:26:23.965 --> 01:26:24.380
maybe

36d6140f-9722-4559-9608-03b1db35495b-0
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.240
A repair shop.

cbea2465-e062-41f1-88cc-02c86ece1c0d-0
01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.669
And other vehicles being worked
on. There's vehicles  through

cbea2465-e062-41f1-88cc-02c86ece1c0d-1
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:37.500
the streets, there's a main.
This is like a main.

b738fee9-977c-4277-9427-2bdd8f146bc5-0
01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.798
Area of a town. OK, you've got a
fountain, you've got a statue of

b738fee9-977c-4277-9427-2bdd8f146bc5-1
01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.750
some founder you've got

5199f064-251b-437b-9652-e2aee525b3fc-0
01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.510
Pedestrians walking around. Cars
circling this area.

3d6f98e3-77d8-4e0e-9a16-ae6cdf8a018f-0
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.280
You got little little tiny shops
kind of like.

63884e37-cf35-420f-a25e-54af5ffaa4d0-0
01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.658
Uh, I don't know what you call
it. Not not a fair, but I guess

63884e37-cf35-420f-a25e-54af5ffaa4d0-1
01:26:59.658 --> 01:27:02.715
a fair would be a way to
describe it. You know when they

63884e37-cf35-420f-a25e-54af5ffaa4d0-2
01:27:02.715 --> 01:27:05.933
have booths and people go up and
they buy food or plants or

63884e37-cf35-420f-a25e-54af5ffaa4d0-3
01:27:05.933 --> 01:27:06.470
jewelry or

3ad281e5-d46a-41b2-9abd-3bd55c6bc81e-0
01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:11.722
Crafts. And then there's another
there's a business building

3ad281e5-d46a-41b2-9abd-3bd55c6bc81e-1
01:27:11.722 --> 01:27:16.079
right on top of all that, where
people are actually doing their

3ad281e5-d46a-41b2-9abd-3bd55c6bc81e-2
01:27:16.079 --> 01:27:20.368
work. Could see someone on the
computer. You got people taking

3ad281e5-d46a-41b2-9abd-3bd55c6bc81e-3
01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:22.070
break on top of the roof.

884fd8ba-431d-47ab-976b-87f79dcb0b9d-0
01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.320
They're cleaning the windows.

2cb91114-df78-49b4-93be-c7c2c33197da-0
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.180
Um.

5ecdc44f-9776-4f19-acc1-546c405e6283-0
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.720
Looks like there's a government
building.

3eaa2b99-824f-4fab-bf75-66f8a32ed468-0
01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.650
And.

368b3fc1-2feb-45c6-a1a2-27d83d290ff0-0
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:37.964
There's a there's somebody
coming out of a manhole that's

368b3fc1-2feb-45c6-a1a2-27d83d290ff0-1
01:27:37.964 --> 01:27:39.960
entertaining there's someone on
a bike.

22b4071e-d5cb-4d4f-b874-cd69b4982446-0
01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:46.580
There's somebody on a motorcycle
that's that's, you know, making

6c941b38-f55e-437f-a949-5578a313794e-0
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.890
put gas.

92d2d169-de39-4ec0-9f0f-a474b099d536-0
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.320
And.

85323798-9ec8-4532-9376-ed8256007df4-0
01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.130
Let's see what else we got going
on here. Just.

a94339af-4a7c-4d97-9e43-82cd7a719a61-0
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:58.922
Another the sort of government
building looks like another

a94339af-4a7c-4d97-9e43-82cd7a719a61-1
01:27:58.922 --> 01:27:59.720
government building.

855442dc-66df-42e9-87c9-9814b898178b-0
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:05.662
We got firemen, like I said, I
think that looks like they're

855442dc-66df-42e9-87c9-9814b898178b-1
01:28:05.662 --> 01:28:09.834
maybe putting out a fire, but I
can't see it because the the

855442dc-66df-42e9-87c9-9814b898178b-2
01:28:09.834 --> 01:28:14.075
Waldo thing is covering it up.
But they're also why are there

855442dc-66df-42e9-87c9-9814b898178b-3
01:28:14.075 --> 01:28:17.631
people on roofs? I don't
understand that people are

855442dc-66df-42e9-87c9-9814b898178b-4
01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:19.409
climbing out of the roofs.

61584b81-010f-461a-8b5a-247580644023-0
01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.840
Other than that, looks like a
normal normal.

8fbc05f5-f8c1-4048-9a7e-51caf4c9ec62-0
01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.170
Just a variety of things going
on in a little tiny city.

9194713d-6aa3-4fdf-ac76-3596fe745ace-0
01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.440
OK.

804d2f91-1c1e-432e-b476-d424bb00e9fc-0
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:34.780
Oh wait, there was an accident.
It looks like 2 cars hit each

804d2f91-1c1e-432e-b476-d424bb00e9fc-1
01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:35.110
other.

c68653f7-1c00-438f-a98d-d6508b06a712-0
01:28:36.690 --> 01:28:38.981
Yeah. And people
are discussing it and there

c68653f7-1c00-438f-a98d-d6508b06a712-1
01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:41.510
comes a policeman chasing, he's
going to come over there, yeah. #END_waldo_1

de147711-6a39-467f-9f4b-43ce628ab00e-0
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:43.830
OK.

02f38eed-1c81-48b7-b30e-e88580d31245-0
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.430
Cool.

8262f87a-180c-47fd-b978-9afba6623b8c-0
01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:51.398
So moving on, you can oops,
that was what I had planned, but

8262f87a-180c-47fd-b978-9afba6623b8c-1
01:28:51.398 --> 01:28:53.140
let's do a couple more.

e3f3a43c-06a1-4e83-ba31-7d7d85ced1d7-0
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.584
{Sorry if I'm a little bit out
of it, I actually I I have

e3f3a43c-06a1-4e83-ba31-7d7d85ced1d7-1
01:28:57.584 --> 01:28:57.930
COVID.}

2f4fd08c-f9f1-416a-863a-164200d367ae-0
01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.767
Ohh no. Yeah, I'm. I'm good,
I'm good. But it's just like, I

2f4fd08c-f9f1-416a-863a-164200d367ae-1
01:29:01.767 --> 01:29:04.905
guess it's hard for me to maybe
just slightly harder for me to

2f4fd08c-f9f1-416a-863a-164200d367ae-2
01:29:04.905 --> 01:29:06.300
describe things. That's OK.

955f9e46-5c9e-46b2-ae11-f254c0af2910-0
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:10.050
Ohh sorry.

8fb2eda7-7a6a-412a-8331-4b0e92ffd22f-0
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:23.794
So the next one will be a
graphic novel that's about 20

8fb2eda7-7a6a-412a-8331-4b0e92ffd22f-1
01:29:23.794 --> 01:29:24.340
pages.

dd3bf633-b97c-4bf9-92ff-bf23fc423530-0
01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:29.220
The style will look a little
more familiar.

517e8364-ba6b-43d1-bf6c-95fa4f836859-0
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:44.930
So again, just describe what
you see and what is happening as

517e8364-ba6b-43d1-bf6c-95fa4f836859-1
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:50.152
you go through the story, OK.
#START_quest OK. This is back to

517e8364-ba6b-43d1-bf6c-95fa4f836859-2
01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.540
our kind of like.

e6ff13fd-bae5-4156-96c8-d0962f71a800-0
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:57.623
Where we have our colorful
characters, the young boy and

e6ff13fd-bae5-4156-96c8-d0962f71a800-1
01:29:57.623 --> 01:30:01.460
young girl and the purple crayon
and orange crayon or red crayon.

53aa7450-7306-4079-aa41-bcfafde9e11e-0
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.015
And it's a it's a children's
book again, it's got a

53aa7450-7306-4079-aa41-bcfafde9e11e-1
01:30:06.015 --> 01:30:10.760
dedication on it, and it starts
out with a statue of what would

53aa7450-7306-4079-aa41-bcfafde9e11e-2
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.650
be a winged.

95c7f6d4-2e16-46fa-8886-016cb2a217a8-0
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:13.210
Uh.

00fa7fb7-f175-4f88-b01c-df0baeadaa7f-0
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:20.070
Person. So you know somebody who
can fly or wants to fly. And

00fa7fb7-f175-4f88-b01c-df0baeadaa7f-1
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:26.173
there's a it's a cement bridge,
probably a castle again, and the

00fa7fb7-f175-4f88-b01c-df0baeadaa7f-2
01:30:26.173 --> 01:30:27.300
two kids are

73829310-5359-4d7c-8cc5-c1541c82e50a-0
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:32.175
Kind of looking at a door and
just figuring out what to do

73829310-5359-4d7c-8cc5-c1541c82e50a-1
01:30:32.175 --> 01:30:32.500
next.

60e11803-0f25-4781-be84-d2434c9b5198-0
01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:41.733
So outside of this door comes a
man with a crown. He has a very

60e11803-0f25-4781-be84-d2434c9b5198-1
01:30:41.733 --> 01:30:47.023
long beard, long hair, and he's
presenting these children with

60e11803-0f25-4781-be84-d2434c9b5198-2
01:30:47.023 --> 01:30:52.396
something on paper that has to
do with a big circle with little

60e11803-0f25-4781-be84-d2434c9b5198-3
01:30:52.396 --> 01:30:57.686
circles around it or on it, one
big circle with little circles

60e11803-0f25-4781-be84-d2434c9b5198-4
01:30:57.686 --> 01:31:02.555
on it. And again, they have
their purple flying bird with

60e11803-0f25-4781-be84-d2434c9b5198-5
01:31:02.555 --> 01:31:06.250
them, and the bird is also
looking at this.

0bb5eaac-8633-4b10-b573-2b9138d9a689-0
01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:09.905
So the kids look a little bit
scared. They don't know what

0bb5eaac-8633-4b10-b573-2b9138d9a689-1
01:31:09.905 --> 01:31:13.201
this piece of paper is all
about. And the man also has

0bb5eaac-8633-4b10-b573-2b9138d9a689-2
01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:14.760
something that looks like.

e9aedf5f-f74d-4371-a1d6-e29ea55eed9c-0
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:20.420
Military. Like a gun, maybe? Or
some kind of.

301ea35f-553e-4b70-98a5-94c894618b96-0
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:25.080
Sash, I don't. I don't think
it's bullets, but it's like the

301ea35f-553e-4b70-98a5-94c894618b96-1
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.651
sash that might hold bullets.
That's just kind of my initial

301ea35f-553e-4b70-98a5-94c894618b96-2
01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:31.930
reaction. So the man with the
crown coming out of this.

5e5927d4-0fda-47ff-b819-671ddf4f3115-0
01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:34.190
Building.

06891967-f4c7-403a-ab6e-60c301cbe3b6-0
01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:40.906
Puts the sash on the young boy.
I think it's a boy. And the

06891967-f4c7-403a-ab6e-60c301cbe3b6-1
01:31:40.906 --> 01:31:45.615
other little boy is now holding
a piece of paper with his purple

06891967-f4c7-403a-ab6e-60c301cbe3b6-2
01:31:45.615 --> 01:31:50.251
crayon and his purple bird. OK,
so we're going to have a little

06891967-f4c7-403a-ab6e-60c301cbe3b6-3
01:31:50.251 --> 01:31:52.280
bit of trouble next because.

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-0
01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:56.373
That man with the crown
evidently was not supposed to

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-1
01:31:56.373 --> 01:31:59.786
give them this information,
because you can see that two

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-2
01:31:59.786 --> 01:32:03.559
other individuals are coming out
of that same doorway and they

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-3
01:32:03.559 --> 01:32:07.092
have swords or pitchforks or
whatever. Not pitchforks, but

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-4
01:32:07.092 --> 01:32:10.505
pitch devices, and they're
pulling him back in like you.

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-5
01:32:10.505 --> 01:32:14.337
Why are you out here with these
kids? You shouldn't be out here

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-6
01:32:14.337 --> 01:32:18.290
with these kids. Don't be giving
them anything. The kids are kind

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-7
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:21.882
of scared, that one each other
crayons still, and they have

8f3f4014-1992-4738-9023-be23d7a87fed-8
01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:23.320
their bird, but the the.

28e77f67-7795-4fe4-92b1-8131ab1cc9b6-0
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:26.855
Crown older man is now being
pulled back into the to the

28e77f67-7795-4fe4-92b1-8131ab1cc9b6-1
01:32:26.855 --> 01:32:30.244
building and they're just kind
of watching, kind of wondering

28e77f67-7795-4fe4-92b1-8131ab1cc9b6-2
01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:33.468
what's going to happen next.
They're not. They're a little

28e77f67-7795-4fe4-92b1-8131ab1cc9b6-3
01:32:33.468 --> 01:32:34.069
bit scared.

37e4e4c3-6f49-4492-b6e7-ab11cb2b89c8-0
01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:40.969
OK, so now what they've decided
to do now that the man, the

37e4e4c3-6f49-4492-b6e7-ab11cb2b89c8-1
01:32:40.969 --> 01:32:45.338
older man with long hair, is
gone and they have a sash that

37e4e4c3-6f49-4492-b6e7-ab11cb2b89c8-2
01:32:45.338 --> 01:32:49.852
they can put their crayons in
and a map of some sort, they're

37e4e4c3-6f49-4492-b6e7-ab11cb2b89c8-3
01:32:49.852 --> 01:32:54.440
going to draw, they're going to
draw the door shut and they're

37e4e4c3-6f49-4492-b6e7-ab11cb2b89c8-4
01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.460
going to draw.

e72e67c2-a486-4ad2-9e3a-bd31a861deb4-0
01:32:56.490 --> 01:32:59.789
Keys. They're gonna draw some
keys, a red key and a purple

e72e67c2-a486-4ad2-9e3a-bd31a861deb4-1
01:32:59.789 --> 01:33:03.257
key, and they're going to use
those keys to get back in there

e72e67c2-a486-4ad2-9e3a-bd31a861deb4-2
01:33:03.257 --> 01:33:06.725
to get to that man. And their
bird is going to come with them

e72e67c2-a486-4ad2-9e3a-bd31a861deb4-3
01:33:06.725 --> 01:33:07.900
too, the purple bird.

78756a94-caa5-4984-b345-8abb8b6bfc74-0
01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:14.280
They get inside and it's another
magical world again, where?

8525e3a5-8e31-498f-9a6b-4f59fa5f8942-0
01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:20.243
They are on the edge of a
waterfall and they've come. I

8525e3a5-8e31-498f-9a6b-4f59fa5f8942-1
01:33:20.243 --> 01:33:26.041
think that that door was part of
a actually it was into a land

8525e3a5-8e31-498f-9a6b-4f59fa5f8942-2
01:33:26.041 --> 01:33:31.655
structure, maybe like a cave of
some sort, I'm not sure. And

8525e3a5-8e31-498f-9a6b-4f59fa5f8942-3
01:33:31.655 --> 01:33:32.760
there's sky.

8da7e13d-0041-4ca9-80f4-a63575928dab-0
01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.010
People flying in the sky.

380c3201-3bd5-4849-abcf-1942676f8888-0
01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.335
But anyways, we're back to this
castle with a Moat and they're

380c3201-3bd5-4849-abcf-1942676f8888-1
01:33:40.335 --> 01:33:44.621
on the opposite side, so they're
watching as the man is being

380c3201-3bd5-4849-abcf-1942676f8888-2
01:33:44.621 --> 01:33:48.977
taken away on some kind of water
vessel with other individuals

380c3201-3bd5-4849-abcf-1942676f8888-3
01:33:48.977 --> 01:33:51.949
and some people in charge and
some people.

fb44c9f0-02e5-483c-bae4-d0a5892019d7-0
01:33:52.710 --> 01:33:56.786
With Spears, that's the word. I
want to use Spears, and they

fb44c9f0-02e5-483c-bae4-d0a5892019d7-1
01:33:56.786 --> 01:34:00.661
didn't like that he was helping
those kids, so he's going

fb44c9f0-02e5-483c-bae4-d0a5892019d7-2
01:34:00.661 --> 01:34:01.330
somewhere.

935ac644-148c-427d-956e-d79e48024395-0
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:11.511
OK, so here we go, there the
kids. Now that that water

935ac644-148c-427d-956e-d79e48024395-1
01:34:11.511 --> 01:34:15.750
vessels off. The man with the
crown is being guarded by these

935ac644-148c-427d-956e-d79e48024395-2
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.050
people with Spears.

16701a33-76a9-416b-a676-6ba21b046196-0
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:21.941
And the kids are now looking at
this map that Kate they gave. He

16701a33-76a9-416b-a676-6ba21b046196-1
01:34:21.941 --> 01:34:24.230
gave them the one with the
circles.

46ed53d0-79c0-4078-836d-c04d8c7abbc0-0
01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:27.900
The rainbow circles and each.

ea097ca4-0530-4eee-90fd-cc8ba76e729f-0
01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.337
Circle around this rainbow
circle. It's like a clock, OK?

ea097ca4-0530-4eee-90fd-cc8ba76e729f-1
01:34:32.337 --> 01:34:36.163
And you've got you've got things
at different points in the

ea097ca4-0530-4eee-90fd-cc8ba76e729f-2
01:34:36.163 --> 01:34:38.650
clock. They all have their
individual.

24e2e789-3c4d-4a63-8a11-fe17ff2b6bb0-0
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:44.251
Pictures with circles, and
they're trying to figure out

24e2e789-3c4d-4a63-8a11-fe17ff2b6bb0-1
01:34:44.251 --> 01:34:48.350
what does this mean. It looks
like it's a map of a land where

24e2e789-3c4d-4a63-8a11-fe17ff2b6bb0-2
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:51.920
several of the things we've
talked about are circled.

4f554183-502f-4e26-8ca9-8edc9f48b5a8-0
01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.380
We got a.

e7d6cc5c-54ca-4a10-befa-0ce4c28b8159-0
01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.215
Something that looks like water,
where there's fish, we've got

e7d6cc5c-54ca-4a10-befa-0ce4c28b8159-1
01:35:00.215 --> 01:35:04.863
something looks like skyscrapers
or tall buildings or castle type

e7d6cc5c-54ca-4a10-befa-0ce4c28b8159-2
01:35:04.863 --> 01:35:09.017
of things. We've got the forest
with the the lighting, the

e7d6cc5c-54ca-4a10-befa-0ce4c28b8159-3
01:35:09.017 --> 01:35:12.889
lanterns. We've got a palm tree,
we've got a mountain.

d4e814a2-d32d-4e80-8ca9-ad0de4c32118-0
01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:17.083
A snowy mountain and I can't
really see because again, {I

d4e814a2-d32d-4e80-8ca9-ad0de4c32118-1
01:35:17.083 --> 01:35:18.730
don't know if I can move you.}

3e2ba273-0094-483d-909e-fe97890fae07-0
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:22.880
{And I'm move you? I don't
know.}

9b370bc4-fea1-4fae-ac64-5ff01b770889-0
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:29.490
{Sorry. Oh, no worries. Oh,
there you go.} And it's a.

6166e98f-551b-4db3-8b46-26ad8bf51343-0
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:32.810
Looks like a bridge.

375ed5ec-64e6-492b-a032-f84ccf295491-0
01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.490
A bridge with some smoke.

1d9ff203-2c53-46e0-9445-e819aa9aa2f4-0
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:41.166
I think there's just a variety
of things that we've already

1d9ff203-2c53-46e0-9445-e819aa9aa2f4-1
01:35:41.166 --> 01:35:43.680
seen through the story. There's
that magic Castle.

1d105ec3-7784-4d20-9820-cdf86d1e2d16-0
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:47.468
In the background, and we're
going to figure out where this

1d105ec3-7784-4d20-9820-cdf86d1e2d16-1
01:35:47.468 --> 01:35:47.930
takes them.

22d9d77c-d6a1-42bb-be83-3e0add1ab672-0
01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:54.795
OK, so they're still hiding
behind this this rock and they

22d9d77c-d6a1-42bb-be83-3e0add1ab672-1
01:35:54.795 --> 01:35:59.468
see another boat coming and that
boat has that one of those

22d9d77c-d6a1-42bb-be83-3e0add1ab672-2
01:35:59.468 --> 01:36:03.985
individuals that had that bird
cage and it looks like the

22d9d77c-d6a1-42bb-be83-3e0add1ab672-3
01:36:03.985 --> 01:36:08.658
person is holding the bird
cages, being told you would have

22d9d77c-d6a1-42bb-be83-3e0add1ab672-4
01:36:08.658 --> 01:36:11.540
to do something with this bird
cage.

31d0a4ce-8de4-423f-8b00-e5f6a55f3172-0
01:36:12.730 --> 01:36:15.520
Now we still have the kids that
have the purple bird.

dba78b22-cdad-428c-a88c-925f2e30db21-0
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:20.251
And they are behind this rock,
and they're looking like they

dba78b22-cdad-428c-a88c-925f2e30db21-1
01:36:20.251 --> 01:36:23.262
better protect themselves, so
they get their crayons out

dba78b22-cdad-428c-a88c-925f2e30db21-2
01:36:23.262 --> 01:36:24.530
again. Oh, this is cute.

b3df441b-b9d6-46d8-82f3-948d3eb90a75-0
01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:26.950
They draw.

1558c965-a54b-4937-a8d7-5298a8adb157-0
01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:29.140
Scuba feet.

2ce15631-4f57-4fff-8065-2d4e4ec997ee-0
01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:31.120
And.

0b78fd58-bacd-40cb-af41-6166c5fb0d64-0
01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.530
Maybe even a scuba tank.

9dd0fa25-3019-4cf3-975c-016cfbac2e4d-0
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:36.300
And.

1c8c4701-9eee-4610-8106-22e1ee2a5a4d-0
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:40.539
Dive into the water with what
was a bird is now like an

1c8c4701-9eee-4610-8106-22e1ee2a5a4d-1
01:36:40.539 --> 01:36:43.697
octopus. They're going to go
into water and they're gonna

1c8c4701-9eee-4610-8106-22e1ee2a5a4d-2
01:36:43.697 --> 01:36:43.970
hide.

5e633eab-9fb8-4ebc-9d86-2e58a0d75db5-0
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.570
Now they're in the water with
their

6777dab0-e0d1-453c-bf1a-ad47d6242392-0
01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:57.237
Scuba gear and they're crayons
on the on the sash, and their

6777dab0-e0d1-453c-bf1a-ad47d6242392-1
01:36:57.237 --> 01:37:02.538
bird is both a bird and an
octopus, and they're going

6777dab0-e0d1-453c-bf1a-ad47d6242392-2
01:37:02.538 --> 01:37:05.680
towards some kind of underwater.

b3509b27-e0a3-4615-b589-46fd465807f2-0
01:37:06.330 --> 01:37:08.020
Structure that has.

c04be91e-267f-4cd3-8020-99e717674c0a-0
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.883
Been a little bit destroyed, but
something's going to happen when

c04be91e-267f-4cd3-8020-99e717674c0a-1
01:37:11.883 --> 01:37:14.780
they get there. There's some
kind of life going on in there.

22b5bb32-9b02-4bfb-8538-ae1155cce9fb-0
01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.810
OK. So once they get in there.

23cbdb77-ce03-40f9-bf44-edca6b55e6c4-0
01:37:21.090 --> 01:37:22.300
They are.

9c7819e3-fa7c-42ae-9c46-fc65b6ac2778-0
01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.933
Looking at a vessel of some sort
of like a structure or ceramic,

9c7819e3-fa7c-42ae-9c46-fc65b6ac2778-1
01:37:26.933 --> 01:37:30.478
I'd like to say surrounding,
it's something that somebody

9c7819e3-fa7c-42ae-9c46-fc65b6ac2778-2
01:37:30.478 --> 01:37:31.090
made with.

b193803f-1f50-4cd5-9ac6-7c0408671a29-0
01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:36.165
Dragons on it. And it's
underwater still. And we're

b193803f-1f50-4cd5-9ac6-7c0408671a29-1
01:37:36.165 --> 01:37:39.992
we've got our pillars and and we
look, we have a pillar that even

b193803f-1f50-4cd5-9ac6-7c0408671a29-2
01:37:39.992 --> 01:37:41.210
looks like a mermaid.

14058c69-41e1-410a-aa43-8f2c699195ea-0
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:44.520
Um, there's fish.

0ad15ee9-d6c3-4d8d-873e-bead77e832d8-0
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:50.968
And they can see now they are
trying to do something with that

0ad15ee9-d6c3-4d8d-873e-bead77e832d8-1
01:37:50.968 --> 01:37:52.460
that vase looking

f5483a49-7e68-4c7d-8a25-b6d4b7cf1040-0
01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.510
Dragon's Middle section, but I
don't know what it is. Anyways,

f5483a49-7e68-4c7d-8a25-b6d4b7cf1040-1
01:37:58.510 --> 01:38:03.416
these other people jump in the
water to chase after them and so

f5483a49-7e68-4c7d-8a25-b6d4b7cf1040-2
01:38:03.416 --> 01:38:06.330
they grab hold of their octopus
bird.

c6396f47-dd41-4484-83d8-aec0b7820f15-0
01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:12.619
And they hold on to the map and
they're being taken up to safety

c6396f47-dd41-4484-83d8-aec0b7820f15-1
01:38:12.619 --> 01:38:17.798
while these other people are
chasing after them. They get to

c6396f47-dd41-4484-83d8-aec0b7820f15-2
01:38:17.798 --> 01:38:22.808
land and the bird leads them
towards those, the palm trees

c6396f47-dd41-4484-83d8-aec0b7820f15-3
01:38:22.808 --> 01:38:27.903
that I think I mentioned against
the Snowcap Mountains, and

c6396f47-dd41-4484-83d8-aec0b7820f15-4
01:38:27.903 --> 01:38:31.299
they're going to climb up on
this land.

804e4078-0b6d-4560-9c59-fee8ff21ebae-0
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:35.397
And once they get to the land,
they're going to use their

804e4078-0b6d-4560-9c59-fee8ff21ebae-1
01:38:35.397 --> 01:38:38.664
crayons again. They've ditched
their scuba gear. They're going

804e4078-0b6d-4560-9c59-fee8ff21ebae-2
01:38:38.664 --> 01:38:41.776
to draw something else that's
going to take them somewhere.

804e4078-0b6d-4560-9c59-fee8ff21ebae-3
01:38:41.776 --> 01:38:45.043
They want both. One has a purple
and one has red. And you know

804e4078-0b6d-4560-9c59-fee8ff21ebae-4
01:38:45.043 --> 01:38:47.740
what they're drawing? They're
drawing a rhinoceros.

a66c4b46-3260-4478-9cf2-5cd65eda1607-0
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:52.430
That they can put a

54569310-6691-40ff-af28-ec4e3ca42a35-0
01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:58.066
Something that can sit on on top
of that rhinoceros and it's an

54569310-6691-40ff-af28-ec4e3ca42a35-1
01:38:58.066 --> 01:38:58.640
open air

eb41f0dc-ab82-495f-a815-026696b3d245-0
01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:01.980
Device that they sit in

3d58359a-f10a-40f8-809f-c6ed8c925a14-0
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:06.570
Carriage like and they're going
to be carried through this.

d0f9375f-3997-4884-ac60-35a7cedfa97c-0
01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.140
Uh.

00106419-d090-4e1e-94a2-4d81a13bbd8f-0
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:14.321
archaic kind of. What do you
call the ruins? This reminds me

00106419-d090-4e1e-94a2-4d81a13bbd8f-1
01:39:14.321 --> 01:39:15.110
of the ruins.

df6f293a-1961-41f5-b60e-23343b537e89-0
01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:19.470
I don't know, I'm going to say.

da244037-f371-4c19-a2cf-d706e12e9990-0
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:21.680
"Cheat nitza."

35b143ac-08fc-4a15-9365-c4933e447392-0
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:27.620
Anyways, they're going to be
taken to this uh, maze of.

2c96515e-4388-42dc-a1e1-7ed8603acebc-0
01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.634
Ruins and end up probably across
the Bay, across a part of the

2c96515e-4388-42dc-a1e1-7ed8603acebc-1
01:39:32.634 --> 01:39:36.230
ocean where the structure is
coming out of the water.

f55849c7-9fe5-4f25-aef0-914753178735-0
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:41.706
But I can't be sure yet. OK, so
the structure that's coming out

f55849c7-9fe5-4f25-aef0-914753178735-1
01:39:41.706 --> 01:39:42.490
of the water.

56984c43-4551-4f73-816e-ccea8ae67cdf-0
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:46.849
With this bright light on very
top, which kind of reminded me

56984c43-4551-4f73-816e-ccea8ae67cdf-1
01:39:46.849 --> 01:39:50.405
of what I was trying to describe
with those dragon, the Dragon

56984c43-4551-4f73-816e-ccea8ae67cdf-2
01:39:50.405 --> 01:39:51.760
Balls. Anyways, there's.

dbeb6445-3341-485e-8be0-485bc9afe739-0
01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:58.969
A rope bridge that these kids
have to cross to get from where

dbeb6445-3341-485e-8be0-485bc9afe739-1
01:39:58.969 --> 01:39:59.660
they are.

ce336e30-238c-44df-a9f9-0684906428d3-0
01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:04.369
With the the ruins over to this
single structure with the light

ce336e30-238c-44df-a9f9-0684906428d3-1
01:40:04.369 --> 01:40:07.894
at the top and their bird is
guiding them and hopefully going

ce336e30-238c-44df-a9f9-0684906428d3-2
01:40:07.894 --> 01:40:08.520
to make it.

07468a5f-5255-4033-a281-80bdf9f8e641-0
01:40:10.930 --> 01:40:12.840
OK, so once they get all the way
across.

01aa985b-7f61-4468-980d-0a0c79420b0d-0
01:40:14.110 --> 01:40:18.365
They're up near the top where
the light is. It's almost like a

01aa985b-7f61-4468-980d-0a0c79420b0d-1
01:40:18.365 --> 01:40:21.540
a lid tower, let's say, and
there's also some.

60278b0d-e5f7-45a2-a555-fdb2eb2ca30d-0
01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:25.482
Uh, like hieroglyphics? Like
Mayan? I'd like to say Mayan

60278b0d-e5f7-45a2-a555-fdb2eb2ca30d-1
01:40:25.482 --> 01:40:28.960
because that's something I'm
kind of know, just some kind of.

1da08c73-bc48-4ca6-8fc9-a3cebd970488-0
01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:30.640
Of.

22733032-4035-4dee-a6d7-56c8c4012b39-0
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.494
Old hieroglyphic structure,
though these people are still

22733032-4035-4dee-a6d7-56c8c4012b39-1
01:40:34.494 --> 01:40:37.429
chasing them. That's the
bothersome part. These people

22733032-4035-4dee-a6d7-56c8c4012b39-2
01:40:37.429 --> 01:40:40.897
with Spears are chasing them. I
don't understand what these kids

22733032-4035-4dee-a6d7-56c8c4012b39-3
01:40:40.897 --> 01:40:44.099
ever did, except they have that
map in their hand and their

22733032-4035-4dee-a6d7-56c8c4012b39-4
01:40:44.099 --> 01:40:45.700
birds still looking over them.

d1db9f8b-e2d8-4d72-a26d-e97b6758739c-0
01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:50.590
And you can see somebody across
the way over at those old ruins.

d1db9f8b-e2d8-4d72-a26d-e97b6758739c-1
01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:52.050
You can see them watching.

e1c8b2e0-831f-4e9d-ab50-54db5db9bde1-0
01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.670
So these kids take their crayons
again, and I'm drawing

e1c8b2e0-831f-4e9d-ab50-54db5db9bde1-1
01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:58.920
something. One of them's drawing
a box.

0b2849b2-4f59-4863-9fbd-b07be375f906-0
01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:03.101
Uh 3D box you can see. And the
other one is drawing, I don't

0b2849b2-4f59-4863-9fbd-b07be375f906-1
01:41:03.101 --> 01:41:06.600
know, silhouettes of some sort
that we're going to figure out

0b2849b2-4f59-4863-9fbd-b07be375f906-2
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.390
what they are.

8fb7e5d7-591d-4c56-9d82-2d70c1fe9073-0
01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:14.147
OK. So the box is going to be a
seat that they're going to sit

8fb7e5d7-591d-4c56-9d82-2d70c1fe9073-1
01:41:14.147 --> 01:41:16.120
on and it's going to be.

94c9a8ab-bdcb-4d4b-a1b2-494282c49cd8-0
01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:21.219
Pulled by this those, those
purple, what I was trying to

94c9a8ab-bdcb-4d4b-a1b2-494282c49cd8-1
01:41:21.219 --> 01:41:25.695
describe to you, they were
actually wings. He was drawing

94c9a8ab-bdcb-4d4b-a1b2-494282c49cd8-2
01:41:25.695 --> 01:41:30.248
wings and those wings are not
complete. Four wings on what

94c9a8ab-bdcb-4d4b-a1b2-494282c49cd8-3
01:41:30.248 --> 01:41:35.342
would be like an animal with the
body and legs flying through the

94c9a8ab-bdcb-4d4b-a1b2-494282c49cd8-4
01:41:35.342 --> 01:41:38.969
air and those little tiny legs
of that animal.

e11144dd-a758-49c8-b4f4-37955222ace5-0
01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.193
It's holding strings on the
seat, so the kids are being

e11144dd-a758-49c8-b4f4-37955222ace5-1
01:41:44.193 --> 01:41:46.150
carried away by this magical

f8bfedce-fd3a-44b4-82cd-617b63f65c88-0
01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.360
Dragonfly, that's what's good.
Like it's like a dragonfly and

f8bfedce-fd3a-44b4-82cd-617b63f65c88-1
01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:53.744
these people with the Spears and
all the metal, they're just

f8bfedce-fd3a-44b4-82cd-617b63f65c88-2
01:41:53.744 --> 01:41:57.240
trying to reach out to them and
it looks like they're going to

f8bfedce-fd3a-44b4-82cd-617b63f65c88-3
01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:57.739
get away.

40321bdb-6f1d-4f3a-9991-07904ee92c11-0
01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:04.740
They do get away. They get away
to some ancient.

426a2aca-cfb2-47c4-b554-4f7d5b9d4cd2-0
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:10.360
What do you call that throne for
some kind of God.

5b16f6ce-5a42-4dab-a9c5-26f101cf697c-0
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:12.490
And.

e60c72f7-3622-4245-8650-47c687b23bfb-0
01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:14.810
They land on top of this

cde2cf8f-c230-4577-a563-abb765bc5291-0
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:16.510
Building.

22a4127b-b08b-431e-ad0f-7b2cda86ccf9-0
01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.950
That has been built for this
God.

21e2db1d-21d2-4a5a-acac-4d680901c5e2-0
01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.108
And these people are still
chasing after them, but now

21e2db1d-21d2-4a5a-acac-4d680901c5e2-1
01:42:22.108 --> 01:42:22.710
they're in like.

b6729926-e840-426f-80ed-7f3e75ded388-0
01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.350
Airborne boats.

dc520485-9931-4069-b7df-8102d19488ae-0
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:31.236
Anyways, over here the kids are
looking at their map or their

dc520485-9931-4069-b7df-8102d19488ae-1
01:42:31.236 --> 01:42:35.469
their their sash. The sash now
has multiple colors of crayons.

dc520485-9931-4069-b7df-8102d19488ae-2
01:42:35.469 --> 01:42:39.703
It's not just red and purple and
their bird is still with them

dc520485-9931-4069-b7df-8102d19488ae-3
01:42:39.703 --> 01:42:42.660
and they still have that map in
their hand.

6440d94d-fdb4-4852-bb14-fa471cc534a1-0
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:47.093
That's mostly what's changed is
there now looking at the sash,

6440d94d-fdb4-4852-bb14-fa471cc534a1-1
01:42:47.093 --> 01:42:49.410
something going to happen now
with that sash.

566ef38b-22ab-485a-be02-8b8dfcfabb3b-0
01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:55.980
Well, lo and behold, these
airborne

106d1614-6f84-4f10-9143-6477e18d5309-0
01:42:57.510 --> 01:43:02.024
Boats carrying these people,
they're chasing them with the

106d1614-6f84-4f10-9143-6477e18d5309-1
01:43:02.024 --> 01:43:02.790
bird cage.

e2db9b6e-0be0-41af-9c97-6457b20314c3-0
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:07.993
Are coming in from the left and
the right now, they are coming

e2db9b6e-0be0-41af-9c97-6457b20314c3-1
01:43:07.993 --> 01:43:11.606
in all force. And the bird,
they're bird, they're purple.

e2db9b6e-0be0-41af-9c97-6457b20314c3-2
01:43:11.606 --> 01:43:14.160
Bird is going to take those
crayons away

7379ba34-d278-426e-99ea-f46f13673e78-0
01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.079
To safety for now. I don't know
why. Or maybe he's just trying

7379ba34-d278-426e-99ea-f46f13673e78-1
01:43:19.079 --> 01:43:22.050
to protect them from the
airborne craft where these

5e0392df-63b2-4b61-b55b-e901951ef583-0
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.650
People are trying to attack
them.

8070d46c-a960-47ea-9d64-699e716f0e98-0
01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:29.300
We've got next the.

50cf9e8e-f686-4ec5-b487-61805a39069d-0
01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.057
What's gonna happen here is that
the bird has taken the crayons.

50cf9e8e-f686-4ec5-b487-61805a39069d-1
01:43:36.057 --> 01:43:40.421
So remember how there's a lot of
different color crayons now he's

50cf9e8e-f686-4ec5-b487-61805a39069d-2
01:43:40.421 --> 01:43:44.454
making a rainbow. The birds made
a rainbow that the kids are

50cf9e8e-f686-4ec5-b487-61805a39069d-3
01:43:44.454 --> 01:43:48.751
going to be able to fly over to
another structure that's also in

50cf9e8e-f686-4ec5-b487-61805a39069d-4
01:43:48.751 --> 01:43:53.049
water while these people who are
trying to capture them with the

50cf9e8e-f686-4ec5-b487-61805a39069d-5
01:43:53.049 --> 01:43:54.570
bird cage and the metal

56653e7a-a77b-4cf8-9899-c6cbebbb8918-0
01:43:56.310 --> 01:44:00.478
Outfits and they're trying to
the crowned guys trying to get

56653e7a-a77b-4cf8-9899-c6cbebbb8918-1
01:44:00.478 --> 01:44:04.510
back the map, I guess, and
they're starting to fail. These

56653e7a-a77b-4cf8-9899-c6cbebbb8918-2
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:08.200
people are chasing them and
starting to have trouble.

75bd2307-ef0a-4d11-91a8-208f1252e79e-0
01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:16.830
So they follow this rainbow over
to a boat. Where

af9bea19-09ee-4bc5-806f-1a95db77c3dd-0
01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:22.645
We originally had seen a man
with the Crown and the long

af9bea19-09ee-4bc5-806f-1a95db77c3dd-1
01:44:22.645 --> 01:44:23.090
hair.

98012765-e3f0-4075-848e-e65cf986ebd4-0
01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:27.140
Being taken away, I believe now

7b45db38-2dce-4be4-9a1d-63b596ceff7e-0
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:31.258
they are joining this man in a
boat and all the bad people are

7b45db38-2dce-4be4-9a1d-63b596ceff7e-1
01:44:31.258 --> 01:44:34.742
getting pushed off the boat. The
people in the metal, you know,

7b45db38-2dce-4be4-9a1d-63b596ceff7e-2
01:44:34.742 --> 01:44:34.960
like

0a1f8626-2b2a-436d-b42a-069999e23531-0
01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:41.097
The ones that were trying to
attack them with the swords,

0a1f8626-2b2a-436d-b42a-069999e23531-1
01:44:41.097 --> 01:44:44.946
they're being pushed off the
boat and so the rest of the

0a1f8626-2b2a-436d-b42a-069999e23531-2
01:44:44.946 --> 01:44:49.134
people in the boat are happy and
the man who had the crown is

0a1f8626-2b2a-436d-b42a-069999e23531-3
01:44:49.134 --> 01:44:50.350
leading this boat.

4b846c6b-87a7-4eb0-8e81-7e8bca4c1ea1-0
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.444
Umm, to safety looks like.
they're going to go back to his

4b846c6b-87a7-4eb0-8e81-7e8bca4c1ea1-1
01:44:57.444 --> 01:45:00.160
castle, which is all very
colorful now.

fdc8b553-2997-4963-93a6-ff54035db625-0
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.549
Doesn't look like there's any
bad people, just good people

fdc8b553-2997-4963-93a6-ff54035db625-1
01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:09.402
taking care of the the leader,
the Queen, the king, and the

fdc8b553-2997-4963-93a6-ff54035db625-2
01:45:09.402 --> 01:45:13.513
kids are going to be taking in
on the oh. All three of them are

fdc8b553-2997-4963-93a6-ff54035db625-3
01:45:13.513 --> 01:45:16.660
now on that purple rhinoceros
with the open air.

05a78bba-64fb-4e3e-aae8-b4804e78c62a-0
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:21.557
Sitting area that the rhinoceros
is carrying and the the man with

05a78bba-64fb-4e3e-aae8-b4804e78c62a-1
01:45:21.557 --> 01:45:25.345
the crown is in front, so he's
taking him back to his house for

05a78bba-64fb-4e3e-aae8-b4804e78c62a-2
01:45:25.345 --> 01:45:25.760
safety.

884bd8e4-a7c4-46fa-9725-617ed7c44181-0
01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.930
Now they're all there again, and
there's a big, beautiful,

884bd8e4-a7c4-46fa-9725-617ed7c44181-1
01:45:33.930 --> 01:45:35.190
beautiful rainbow.

265c859c-e7d5-4588-be02-b90ae60b2e1a-0
01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:39.661
There's flowers on the hill
where there was the waterfall

265c859c-e7d5-4588-be02-b90ae60b2e1a-1
01:45:39.661 --> 01:45:43.163
before. There was no flowers
there before, just that magic

265c859c-e7d5-4588-be02-b90ae60b2e1a-2
01:45:43.163 --> 01:45:43.460
door.

71a72fdb-c175-473d-8aae-d1867a87823a-0
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:48.829
Into the into that cave dwelling
and the man is helping these

71a72fdb-c175-473d-8aae-d1867a87823a-1
01:45:48.829 --> 01:45:53.039
kids get off of the purple
rhinoceros. We still have our

71a72fdb-c175-473d-8aae-d1867a87823a-2
01:45:53.039 --> 01:45:54.000
octopus tail.

d2b70da3-67ca-4703-99b1-c8aac480e1dc-0
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.260
And are flying.

724c0972-5b71-42e8-804d-60999fedb451-0
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.670
Uh, what was that again? The
flying the four wing?

d5743e7d-9402-495b-a08f-20327412d1d0-0
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:07.024
I forget what I called it,
dragon. So the man is now, the

d5743e7d-9402-495b-a08f-20327412d1d0-1
01:46:07.024 --> 01:46:11.508
kids are now standing in front
of this magic door and the man

d5743e7d-9402-495b-a08f-20327412d1d0-2
01:46:11.508 --> 01:46:16.064
has something in his hand. He's
going to crown, he's drawing a

d5743e7d-9402-495b-a08f-20327412d1d0-3
01:46:16.064 --> 01:46:20.548
crown with his crayon, and he's
going to crown the one of the

d5743e7d-9402-495b-a08f-20327412d1d0-4
01:46:20.548 --> 01:46:20.910
boys.

db1cac16-463c-4e92-8b85-a89f4a6d2d11-0
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:24.680
And the bird's blessing them.

bc3429ae-3e69-4b96-bca1-42654b65880f-0
01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:29.470
And then he crosses the other
boy and he wishes him well.

bc3429ae-3e69-4b96-bca1-42654b65880f-1
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:33.756
Namaste. And the next thing's
going to be they go back inside

bc3429ae-3e69-4b96-bca1-42654b65880f-2
01:46:33.756 --> 01:46:37.697
the castle, they go back inside
The Cave and then in the

bc3429ae-3e69-4b96-bca1-42654b65880f-3
01:46:37.697 --> 01:46:38.320
mountain.

af7c899b-184c-417c-9c37-e15c2d5c483c-0
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:41.010
Yeah, they're back inside.

585f1b09-a82b-425a-9fab-271879400ed1-0
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:44.210
And they can see the rainbow
from the outside.

664637ae-1404-414d-bedf-0f2d715f97a9-0
01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:50.324
In the outside world, they're
now in something that looks like

664637ae-1404-414d-bedf-0f2d715f97a9-1
01:46:50.324 --> 01:46:55.112
a safe structure. They've got
their purple dragon with them,

664637ae-1404-414d-bedf-0f2d715f97a9-2
01:46:55.112 --> 01:46:55.740
or bird.

72ec60b5-1e3f-4b57-a592-7829d87e583f-0
01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:59.302
And it looks like
they're back to safety. They

72ec60b5-1e3f-4b57-a592-7829d87e583f-1
01:46:59.302 --> 01:47:01.240
each have their crayon red and
purple. #END_quest 

ec28f7a0-73d7-484f-8bfb-fc5e273df56c-0
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.070
Alright.
