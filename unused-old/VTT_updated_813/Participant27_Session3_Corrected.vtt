00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.966
OK. So continuing on as before,
we'll have two types of pictures

6a012751-a6b3-42a1-a69b-e996e74f6d21-1
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:12.818
in the study and this first one
that we see will be a complex

6a012751-a6b3-42a1-a69b-e996e74f6d21-2
00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:17.826
scene. So please describe what
you see and what is happening in

6a012751-a6b3-42a1-a69b-e996e74f6d21-3
00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:22.130
detail and please take between
three and five minutes.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.070
And you can start when you're
ready.

#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
OK, so here we see a Waldo

47b275fb-4531-487c-8465-a5b597c6ce70-1
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.224

space and horror.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.451
Are in a mice model here? What
cosmic costumes and what great

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:56.650
special effects one of those
flying saucers looks like. It's

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.700
really flying. Are those real?

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.600
Aliens inside? Not actors at
all. So what's real and what's?

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.470

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.796
In films like this.} So it's a
it's a film set where people

46102bd3-0d0b-49e7-b776-445343c32a73-1
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:18.270

So there's a there's a space

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.589
Doing space walks and floating
around. There is a rocket which

dd0c47d6-a62c-4dfd-9a6a-531e07900aab-1
00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:42.353

with its nose in the in the

Stage crews outside the scene
with with pulleys were there

135d1129-2d58-48a1-907f-f0d9665bf960-1
00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:56.660
actually suspending the the
spaceman.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.763
Actors. But mixed in with this,
there are actually little green

0abd1a01-72d0-4cf6-9d2a-c5128ce5cde3-1
00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:05.980
men who don't look like they're
actors at all, but look like

0abd1a01-72d0-4cf6-9d2a-c5128ce5cde3-2
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.570
they're in fact aliens.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.170
And.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.445
The you you see the film crew
actually filming the scene on

5648d47b-48d2-48b4-9573-1cb2886e8918-1
00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:19.480
the edge of a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.990
A gantry that is positioned over
the over the set.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.810
You see

8a1533f1-3e6f-4c9a-bd92-abdee7c37e78-0
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.264
Planets in the in the background
with a man sitting on one of the

dbde5f44-08bd-463b-afc2-2e99f3ab3c62-0
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.964
A boat somehow, and probably
mixed in with this with this

dbde5f44-08bd-463b-afc2-2e99f3ab3c62-1
00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:50.490
scene.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.940
Waldo seems to be in there with
the foot of one of the.

0511d2a1-c5ea-47de-b47a-acc8ee76fbeb-0
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.619
The the flying saucers that have
landed who are meeting with the

0511d2a1-c5ea-47de-b47a-acc8ee76fbeb-1
00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:04.070
aliens.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.495
But there are other scenes in
this in this movie set that are

1d052d16-d209-4f9f-ba2b-9bb648788560-1
00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:18.410
being worked on. So there's a
also a set with with dinosaurs.

5393fdee-d96e-47a8-90f0-791a42f0fc97-0
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.420
And caveman. The dinosaur

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.170
Seem to be pretty friendly and.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.368
In fact, one of the
Tyrannosaurus rex are, he's like

3b26dca5-d94a-4f98-9895-41772aac0af5-1
00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:40.990

and waving his fingers about.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.764
Let's see that there's there's
also a volcano in this set which

fc598aae-1b87-43e1-aace-5bb89c61a10f-1
00:03:53.764 --> 00:03:57.630
is erupting with two Cavemen
being spewed.

About out of the top.

with.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.660
Mummies which must be from a
different.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.140

They there's a there, there are
doors, actually, which will lead

a5dd274b-0a1a-48c0-94c4-fd40859cbbac-1
00:04:42.203 --> 00:04:45.080
on to the to the caveman
dinosaur set.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.130
There's a third set down at the
bottom of the picture.

072caa36-e995-4acd-9e8a-fe7fde6537e6-0
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.200
Which is.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.030
Uh.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.688
It's, uh, it's not clear what
the what the scene is here.

7ae5bf68-2c1c-40f4-87d5-b0bca19a06a3-1
00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:06.504
There are certainly mummies
walking uh about. There's, there

7ae5bf68-2c1c-40f4-87d5-b0bca19a06a3-2
00:05:06.504 --> 00:05:11.161
are, there are green men, but
they look a little different

7ae5bf68-2c1c-40f4-87d5-b0bca19a06a3-3
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:15.977
from the alien green men. They
look like green human beings.

7ae5bf68-2c1c-40f4-87d5-b0bca19a06a3-4
00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.740
There's a a monster. There's a,
a.

37bc95b6-8a1b-4b6a-86d7-eca509ea6c6e-0
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.745
Yeah, I don't know. A cauldron
with smoke coming out of it. Uh,

37bc95b6-8a1b-4b6a-86d7-eca509ea6c6e-1
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:30.631
stained glass windows, a
thunderstorm in the background,

37bc95b6-8a1b-4b6a-86d7-eca509ea6c6e-2
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:32.260
bats flying around.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.860
I'm not sure if it's a tree or
whether it's it's it's green.

fe92695a-76ad-4b95-9244-c77265c55ffa-0
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.684
Or whether it's some kind of
contagion. But it it's it's some

fe92695a-76ad-4b95-9244-c77265c55ffa-1
00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:50.647
kind of horror movie, but in a
in a rather confused fashion.

fe92695a-76ad-4b95-9244-c77265c55ffa-2
00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:51.380
And then.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.340

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:09.471
Looks like a a cafeteria where
actors in costumes are are

c38d0e9c-39d5-4b23-8a7a-88f79282a354-1
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.650
queuing up to get there.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.977
And they're all mixed together
with the aliens and the caveman

9bfbe4fb-9daa-4935-8a52-23ff2b41d7e5-1
00:06:20.977 --> 00:06:26.300

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.288
Through the story. Just keep in
mind that it's the longest one

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.766
Looks like it's been put on the
sea and there's this huge big

1b103f48-f495-4c8d-af7e-e625806dcec2-1
00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:28.173
ship standing towards it with
with strange looking

1b103f48-f495-4c8d-af7e-e625806dcec2-2
00:07:28.173 --> 00:07:29.210
cylindrical.

267c94e7-d99b-4722-a5a3-fa8b2d5afd59-0
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.243
Sails built up with a very big
forecastle and what looks like a

267c94e7-d99b-4722-a5a3-fa8b2d5afd59-1
00:07:36.243 --> 00:07:39.050
diving bell underneath its keel.

bd9511e4-5e5c-4de3-9f71-9148831daeb7-0
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:50.243
We see a sea, a view of the sea
from high above. There are there

bd9511e4-5e5c-4de3-9f71-9148831daeb7-1
00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:55.924
are seagulls flying and down
below is this little paper boat

bd9511e4-5e5c-4de3-9f71-9148831daeb7-2
00:07:55.924 --> 00:07:59.650
the man and the demon had put
together.

a1231c79-6395-4edc-b637-b5c141b608e9-0
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.770


c6ebccf9-b951-493d-b327-169fbc529bc6-0
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:13.239
Now we we're down at the surface
of the sea and we see 2 sea

c6ebccf9-b951-493d-b327-169fbc529bc6-1
00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.470
turtles with checkered shells.

6e72f7e8-7ee7-4687-90e6-e9cd49a8dc54-0
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.171
um looking at this boat with
curiosity and there's one of the

6e72f7e8-7ee7-4687-90e6-e9cd49a8dc54-1
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:28.512
seagulls is also down there
inspecting the boat and to the

6e72f7e8-7ee7-4687-90e6-e9cd49a8dc54-2
00:08:28.512 --> 00:08:29.870
right there is.

11151bc5-f539-4c29-92ef-6eec6a75c97d-0
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.460
Something. It's. I don't know
whether it's a creature or

11151bc5-f539-4c29-92ef-6eec6a75c97d-1
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.260
whether it's a rock. It's black
with a lot of white spots.

b243ef44-9af6-4f6a-bf56-7cf7f3c3380c-0
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.092
One second wait. Oh no. The
second boat. Or maybe the first

b243ef44-9af6-4f6a-bf56-7cf7f3c3380c-1
00:08:44.092 --> 00:08:46.270
boat getting closer. I'm not
sure.

6ef8c881-d424-46d0-ae08-9349a1c653d1-0
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.876
Right. Maybe it's the second
boat, not sure. Anyway, the it

6ef8c881-d424-46d0-ae08-9349a1c653d1-1
00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:59.398
looks like this, the black thing
with white spots is actually a

6ef8c881-d424-46d0-ae08-9349a1c653d1-2
00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:04.920
fish with two big fins and the
the little boat is on top of one

6ef8c881-d424-46d0-ae08-9349a1c653d1-3
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.096
of the fins and it's next to a
coral reef and there are all

6ef8c881-d424-46d0-ae08-9349a1c653d1-4
00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:11.649
kinds of breaches.

a6056492-1fed-43b1-8c58-605d6830d60b-0
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:20.972
in the and the reef, including
one big fish with a like a

a6056492-1fed-43b1-8c58-605d6830d60b-1
00:09:20.972 --> 00:09:28.624
swordfish with a with a long
long projectile front and big

a6056492-1fed-43b1-8c58-605d6830d60b-2
00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:30.700
fin on its back.

73c583f4-3624-428b-9714-29dced0499d2-0
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.100
And there are other fish
swimming around, too.

eeaf10e7-2de6-4c50-83d7-d4e453d7d150-0
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:45.030
So we we now see a huge Shoal of
of fish.

1d13b30d-b644-4a05-bf2b-190c6bf5e3f2-0
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.387
Close to the surface of of the
water we're we're we're looking

1d13b30d-b644-4a05-bf2b-190c6bf5e3f2-1
00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:57.069
sideways. The the water is the
surface of the water is almost

1d13b30d-b644-4a05-bf2b-190c6bf5e3f2-2
00:09:57.069 --> 00:10:01.826
near the top of the picture and
the the boat, the little paper

1d13b30d-b644-4a05-bf2b-190c6bf5e3f2-3
00:10:01.826 --> 00:10:06.735
boat is on top and there are in
fact some of the fish are coming

1d13b30d-b644-4a05-bf2b-190c6bf5e3f2-4
00:10:06.735 --> 00:10:11.568
out of the water and lifting the
the boat above the water below

1d13b30d-b644-4a05-bf2b-190c6bf5e3f2-5
00:10:11.568 --> 00:10:16.249
there's all this this coral with
many fish swimming swimming.

73075fa8-ed8e-4d9b-ba30-a9de54686186-0
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.494
Through the coral and and
various other creatures and

73075fa8-ed8e-4d9b-ba30-a9de54686186-1
00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:21.500
anemones and.

e9312fc0-5f1c-4d43-b66e-c155deadad11-0
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.690
Uh and seaweed and big fish. And
little fish.

7d5c0e93-5356-4688-b4d7-1b053cc855c1-0
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.470
And it's a very, very busy
scene.

aa91d4da-cebe-4ca2-8c91-f6c2caa525b4-0
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.090
Now we see we see two boats.

e2eb5c26-eb75-4c9c-8a97-b5dd20f51c2b-0
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.730
The one on the left.

e4d9376f-dee1-4f82-a840-f55e7ea5be4c-0
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.400
Is.

0500e5da-c2f5-4e1b-96ad-5f9367dc64c7-0
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.470
Being.

eb38a2c0-fea6-4f42-8d16-1ee62eae1812-0
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.670
Looked at by a.

39fcd1cd-352b-490f-98ff-236f8cfbc245-0
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.292
Creature. It's got tentacles on
the end, maybe some kind of

39fcd1cd-352b-490f-98ff-236f8cfbc245-1
00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:07.510
squid, and it's kind of hooked
on to the bottom of the boat.

5ed4aae8-b5ce-4fb7-be96-71e21cf66ea8-0
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.290
And the the other boat is.

e5dc71c3-1918-485d-b350-9986cfb3c3e0-0
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.853
Has a fishing rod sticking out
of it, as though there's

e5dc71c3-1918-485d-b350-9986cfb3c3e0-1
00:11:17.853 --> 00:11:21.551
somebody inside fishing,
although you don't see the

e5dc71c3-1918-485d-b350-9986cfb3c3e0-2
00:11:21.551 --> 00:11:22.690
person and it's.

07af9c98-3c0b-4bc8-8433-d9783f1cabcd-0
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:29.605
Actually caught a fish on the
end of the line, which it is

07af9c98-3c0b-4bc8-8433-d9783f1cabcd-1
00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:31.220
maybe trying to.

c5e9067d-d379-4692-a3dd-6083d995cbfc-0
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.826
Pull up but but we see that
there's a sea creature, very

c5e9067d-d379-4692-a3dd-6083d995cbfc-1
00:11:36.826 --> 00:11:40.615
strange looking alien type sea
creature with a pair of

c5e9067d-d379-4692-a3dd-6083d995cbfc-2
00:11:40.615 --> 00:11:44.954
scissors, which may be about to
rescue the fish by cutting the

c5e9067d-d379-4692-a3dd-6083d995cbfc-3
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:48.330
line. There are other lots of
other fish around.

24c38590-3959-4c38-a7e8-3533ed36356c-0
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.328
2 interesting ohh it they look
like they're fish, but they're

24c38590-3959-4c38-a7e8-3533ed36356c-1
00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:55.050
actually.

c88de0e1-5e80-423d-990b-2983231d5169-0
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.710
Humanoid kinds of creatures.

9f665e48-5123-45f7-bc3e-e98816950ce8-0
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.381
With bodies and arms and heads
of fish and they seem to be

9f665e48-5123-45f7-bc3e-e98816950ce8-1
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.040
kissing down below.

a35030e3-1f07-44ad-be77-97566335e5cf-0
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.120
So now we see again.

7eb87cee-4844-4b47-b954-40c204e8d648-0
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.330
To.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:26.518
This looks like 2 scenes, one
with, with, with a boat with the

c05ab32b-9e05-4792-bd34-346d0b7d4272-1
00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:27.050
boat.

13b60398-c1db-4e2e-8822-2f1fa327636f-0
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.740
Heading towards.

80435def-bcd7-4df1-aa92-fa31ca69aa5f-0
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.818
A fish with its head out of the
water and on top of the fishes,

80435def-bcd7-4df1-aa92-fa31ca69aa5f-1
00:12:37.818 --> 00:12:41.410
a sea horse with a with a
checkered pattern.

9128590c-a766-4088-82f4-8dd91142aac0-0
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:49.341
All kinds of coral again below,
whereas the second picture on

9128590c-a766-4088-82f4-8dd91142aac0-1
00:12:49.341 --> 00:12:50.380
this page.

948a957b-f5c3-46d4-ac04-7e44f052e84d-0
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.580
Shows the seahorse in the boat
and.

882f347a-1275-4b39-9da6-99049a0073dc-0
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.950
One of and and and a whole set
of.

a6b94256-56a2-433e-90c6-f461df354e9f-0
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.940
I don't know what you call them.

d03a112e-838a-4fc1-905a-2ebae3eb41da-0
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:12.557
Worms on the bottom of the of
the sea bed, but one of the

d03a112e-838a-4fc1-905a-2ebae3eb41da-1
00:13:12.557 --> 00:13:18.954
worms has got very long and it's
gone up to the Boat and in fact

d03a112e-838a-4fc1-905a-2ebae3eb41da-2
00:13:18.954 --> 00:13:24.564
looking over the side of the
boat into the inside of the

d03a112e-838a-4fc1-905a-2ebae3eb41da-3
00:13:24.564 --> 00:13:29.780
boat. There are some big flat
fish, maybe flounders.

4bbc0f76-288a-4e8d-bf3c-75a73f9991a0-0
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.571
Almost like raise, all of which
are great except one which is

4bbc0f76-288a-4e8d-bf3c-75a73f9991a0-1
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:39.100
white and one which is has
spots.

c0ae58c7-507d-451e-bbc2-d616dad48164-0
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.550
Now we see.

96676dc2-44fc-46dc-a759-07fc95e90231-0
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.680
Umm.

31100718-3927-403d-99e9-1e20db95cbd4-0
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.700
The boat.

80bb476b-d4d0-4688-a940-de9f96f85baf-0
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.750
Approaching.

6501669e-b123-4e52-b9b1-e8808b726d69-0
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.850
Um.

d0085bdd-94d8-4641-ab05-930ed649391b-0
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.080
It's I guess it's still
underwater. There are a little

d0085bdd-94d8-4641-ab05-930ed649391b-1
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.589
plants sticking up out of the
water, but it's sailing towards

d0085bdd-94d8-4641-ab05-930ed649391b-2
00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:09.390
a big forest of of trees, and in
those trees there are flamingos.

9e32d9df-f1ee-43a9-907b-e4b4a8a29b13-0
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:16.127
Perched at various points maybe,
I don't know, 30, 40 flamingos

9e32d9df-f1ee-43a9-907b-e4b4a8a29b13-1
00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:20.720
are sitting in the tree that the
boat is sailing towards.

0fd0e528-1550-4ee5-a98d-1a3d79ad0cfd-0
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.130
And now the boat.

d9dcf701-7f62-4dee-ae6b-ec9a54e49b20-0
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.030
It is in among the trees and we
see.

67b09ecf-90a6-487b-9e99-338f71a7b308-0
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.241
We see 3 flamingos in the
picture. We see that the the

67b09ecf-90a6-487b-9e99-338f71a7b308-1
00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:44.523
trees are rooted down in the
water. It's not very deep, the

67b09ecf-90a6-487b-9e99-338f71a7b308-2
00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:47.780
little fish floating around
between.

9bdb7b95-199a-4df5-9331-47b7c00c0732-0
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.930
Umm.

566eb7be-6806-4cc9-8bda-7e35e78efb5b-0
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.460
With the big fish kind of in the
background and.

4ab0b989-82a3-4a1a-a288-c9e6604858bb-0
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.420
Smaller fish to the right with
interesting glowing eyes.

8042be8b-0e21-443d-9792-ac6bfb400c8e-0
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:08.880
Have a starfish there, there are
other creatures around, OK.

dfbc3be2-f7dc-4fc7-bb26-4f665b915b1f-0
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.977
Now it's it's getting a little
dark, maybe because of the shade

dfbc3be2-f7dc-4fc7-bb26-4f665b915b1f-1
00:15:16.977 --> 00:15:21.395
of the trees. The the boat still
has the little seahorse in it,

dfbc3be2-f7dc-4fc7-bb26-4f665b915b1f-2
00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:25.605
and the seahorse has a has a
hat, which is in the shape of a

dfbc3be2-f7dc-4fc7-bb26-4f665b915b1f-3
00:15:25.605 --> 00:15:26.710
of a small boat.

62db8e96-0ffc-4c6c-b5b6-bf753d2c4846-0
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:34.001
The the the paper boat is
journeying under the trees.

62db8e96-0ffc-4c6c-b5b6-bf753d2c4846-1
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:40.770
There are glowing eyes from
creatures. They look like maybe.

4dec5aa3-0466-42d3-a7c7-7098d53789b7-0
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.340
I don't know.

e941da8c-1c97-4533-9387-8c784171b587-0
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.380
voles or.

12123f5b-73c5-4e03-b815-61a0b4202a89-0
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.620
Eels or.

0ad7ab72-54a1-4264-8102-769c7be3a87a-0
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.450
Uh, they they look like they
might be a little hungry

0ad7ab72-54a1-4264-8102-769c7be3a87a-1
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.607
actually. And that there are
there are birds sitting on a

0ad7ab72-54a1-4264-8102-769c7be3a87a-2
00:15:59.607 --> 00:16:04.194
branch of the tree that are also
have glowing eyes, and they're

0ad7ab72-54a1-4264-8102-769c7be3a87a-3
00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:06.130
watching the the creatures.

2cc10dbb-6477-4a4a-b8c8-ee87e712a25b-0
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.270
That they are.

f9e313ae-e64f-40d8-9613-1001ee2af833-0
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.205
It's coming down from the that
are looking down from the from

f9e313ae-e64f-40d8-9613-1001ee2af833-1
00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:19.410
the trees. We see the body of
one of the creatures. Maybe the

f9e313ae-e64f-40d8-9613-1001ee2af833-2
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.669
creatures have.

065ef06f-8f51-4a8c-98f4-ec884232577f-0
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.150
have one body and many heads,
but we we see one pair of.

22be46aa-3f84-487f-9d86-72456634ccab-0
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:33.484
Legs of front and rear legs of
of a creature holding onto the

22be46aa-3f84-487f-9d86-72456634ccab-1
00:16:33.484 --> 00:16:35.270
branch of the tree.

a793f162-dd16-4e1d-b9d4-d7b988cb5877-0
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.640
OK.

1c579905-0fbd-486f-9f52-9ca69401944a-0
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.560
Now the.

72a15cdc-02e5-47e0-a0a2-5200ab86d970-0
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:51.560
We see on the right the the
boat.

e66aeb0b-c6b9-4433-bd15-b1cebf7860a9-0
00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.778
Three of the the the trees where
the trees are to the left, and

e66aeb0b-c6b9-4433-bd15-b1cebf7860a9-1
00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:05.764
the sea horse that was in the
boat has jumping off to join

e66aeb0b-c6b9-4433-bd15-b1cebf7860a9-2
00:17:05.764 --> 00:17:10.835
three other sea horses which are
waiting at the edge of the

e66aeb0b-c6b9-4433-bd15-b1cebf7860a9-3
00:17:10.835 --> 00:17:15.906
trees, and as the sea horse
jumps, the little boat type hat

e66aeb0b-c6b9-4433-bd15-b1cebf7860a9-4
00:17:15.906 --> 00:17:17.850
falls off his his head.

eedadf14-9b8c-4311-8e4f-156f22be2d98-0
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.880
It's.

8e4af789-f31a-47ae-bf45-ca2672f75c4b-0
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.300
And we, I mean maybe it's the
same.

8b9f331b-0762-4d5d-bdb1-fd8280caa2bd-0
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.150
Boat. The the. The.

958ff90f-48c0-4276-84a7-9e8374b43117-0
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.317
I can't tell whether these are.
Yeah, there's a discontinuity in

958ff90f-48c0-4276-84a7-9e8374b43117-1
00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:35.460
the picture, so this is probably
just two pictures.

8d351e69-6761-40af-a432-456bdfe58825-0
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.227
In the in the last time one was
the seahorse is still in the

8d351e69-6761-40af-a432-456bdfe58825-1
00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:45.644
boat but looking over the edge
and looking at a a creature and

8d351e69-6761-40af-a432-456bdfe58825-2
00:17:45.644 --> 00:17:50.061
in the right hand one, the the
scene as I described as the the

8d351e69-6761-40af-a432-456bdfe58825-3
00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:54.408
boaters come clear of the trees
and the the sea horse's is is

8d351e69-6761-40af-a432-456bdfe58825-4
00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:58.475
jumping out and and again there
are the various weird and

8d351e69-6761-40af-a432-456bdfe58825-5
00:17:58.475 --> 00:18:01.070
wonderful creatures down below
with.

cbecad97-c23d-494f-9d2f-33a613d04772-0
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.230
Which with glowing eyes on the
left, white fish and A and a big

cbecad97-c23d-494f-9d2f-33a613d04772-1
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.010
sea serpent on the right hand
picture.

9e770d7b-67eb-4e2c-9b6b-8d6a448a9b3f-0
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.900
So here there are clearly 2
pictures. One shows.

79947dfb-8fba-43cf-bacf-a3a7520f92fe-0
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:28.235
Looks like a whale smoking a
pipe with sea gulls on its on

79947dfb-8fba-43cf-bacf-a3a7520f92fe-1
00:18:28.235 --> 00:18:34.234
its head and and small fish down
below. It's casting quite a big

79947dfb-8fba-43cf-bacf-a3a7520f92fe-2
00:18:34.234 --> 00:18:37.650
shadow and then on the right we
see.

f73aec28-61d4-4b3f-8b9d-48438713947e-0
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.490
A different kind of creature
it's got.

c56d1c8f-2fa2-4764-9591-2e0fdadca28b-0
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:45.510
Uh.

ce6742a7-bcca-44b1-97de-b7dcb841ccfa-0
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:54.256
Crab like or lobster like claws
on its front and it's got legs,

ce6742a7-bcca-44b1-97de-b7dcb841ccfa-1
00:18:54.256 --> 00:19:00.552
and on its legs below its legs
are a whole bunch of ships that

ce6742a7-bcca-44b1-97de-b7dcb841ccfa-2
00:19:00.552 --> 00:19:05.850
have been wrecked and are under
the sea and on it's.

82760d87-4527-4fc0-b1e6-3a75ca8a3f90-0
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.180
It's it's got a head with with
teeth and a glowing eye and.

a7fdafca-0435-42ab-8594-9761fb9eef7f-0
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.513
On on its head is a a rod with a
with a with like a TV hanging

a7fdafca-0435-42ab-8594-9761fb9eef7f-1
00:19:18.513 --> 00:19:23.727
from the rod and the the Little
Paper Boat is approaching this,

a7fdafca-0435-42ab-8594-9761fb9eef7f-2
00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:27.150
this creature, maybe attracted
by the TV.

ddbf3d09-a377-43eb-b400-2e8de9ef1bec-0
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.410
And now, uh.

e683b237-07a5-4cdc-966b-5b5c964d8676-0
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:37.920
We see.

ea0ff340-5423-4609-899f-8200033c2319-0
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.230
A different.

f80dcd25-3bb0-4802-bd7c-1224765911da-0
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.910
scene. There's a

b66ccb31-775e-4877-90fa-e8b6a0174e90-0
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.678
A moon with some strange or
maybe it's a sun, I don't know.

b66ccb31-775e-4877-90fa-e8b6a0174e90-1
00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:55.596
It's it's bright bright orb in
the in the sky, just above the

b66ccb31-775e-4877-90fa-e8b6a0174e90-2
00:19:55.596 --> 00:19:58.610
surface of the of the sea. There
are.

d8588906-3c93-47dc-88cd-7e4e64fd8017-0
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.870
There's a.

b8bc5294-5413-4511-9163-0447c98f598d-0
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:09.502
There's a, the little boat is
there as a as a cat that is is

b8bc5294-5413-4511-9163-0447c98f598d-1
00:20:09.502 --> 00:20:13.770
jumping into the boat. There are
many fish like.

41612532-69f5-488d-b696-329fba75e188-0
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.820
Creatures. There are. There are
other.

f06ea5a3-8143-4757-92d3-b75631e71c7d-0
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.160
Creatures that that there's
there are, there are.

a78f52f6-2a25-4305-aff2-6ab50cb192b1-0
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.983
What does it look like birds,
birds but have fish bodies

a78f52f6-2a25-4305-aff2-6ab50cb192b1-1
00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:26.340
flying through the sky.

ae0c726b-5752-432f-a3ef-259de8659c82-0
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.087
That's a oh, I see the the the
really bright thing that perhaps

ae0c726b-5752-432f-a3ef-259de8659c82-1
00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:39.307
looks like a moon actually has
fish characteristics too. It's

ae0c726b-5752-432f-a3ef-259de8659c82-2
00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:40.570
got a tail and.

0e5d8345-2f37-4383-a888-0f66c4b91551-0
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.271
And and the fin. And then
there's another fish, maybe tend

0e5d8345-2f37-4383-a888-0f66c4b91551-1
00:20:47.271 --> 00:20:49.190
to be more moon-like.

5c5bc311-b719-44d4-a9d2-7e0277c05a06-0
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.260
To the right of the picture
floating through the sky.

7732f674-e4b9-4ce0-be06-32c59c069edb-0
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.760
And there are elephants.

57e0329c-9313-4400-847d-9054d86f35c8-0
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.410
Elephant creatures.

bc891928-f324-42d9-a2ac-0e0bcad46f33-0
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.395
On somehow floating above the
surface of the sea. And there's

bc891928-f324-42d9-a2ac-0e0bcad46f33-1
00:21:08.395 --> 00:21:10.210
a leopard and a zebra.

78d32509-1a5c-4336-9109-a31601898f97-0
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.120
And and the horse. So it's a
it's a weird and wonderful.

5c2412bb-650f-4d82-ad03-a5a14aa9c01c-0
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.090
Picture of of things that.

e3713b06-a946-4a7d-ac15-b00771be7b76-0
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.230
Don't are really out of place.

efecfe8d-b917-447d-91cc-2592dda9831c-0
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:32.004
And now we see a a night picture
and what looks like a genuine

efecfe8d-b917-447d-91cc-2592dda9831c-1
00:21:32.004 --> 00:21:34.960
Crescent moon in the in the top
right.

4ecbee1c-0b6b-4436-81d8-f3fca6931131-0
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.530
The little boat is floating on
the surface of the water and

4ecbee1c-0b6b-4436-81d8-f3fca6931131-1
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.244
underneath there are fish with
with glowing eyes that are seem

4ecbee1c-0b6b-4436-81d8-f3fca6931131-2
00:21:46.244 --> 00:21:50.959
to be focused their attention on
the boat as of the the closer

4ecbee1c-0b6b-4436-81d8-f3fca6931131-3
00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:55.673
you get to the boat the more of
these fish there there are and

4ecbee1c-0b6b-4436-81d8-f3fca6931131-4
00:21:55.673 --> 00:21:57.470
they are arrayed around.

18bb0080-e8f6-4188-8bcc-eb4c55b9f6ef-0
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.997
The the boat and then the stuff
in the sky. There are many, many

18bb0080-e8f6-4188-8bcc-eb4c55b9f6ef-1
00:22:02.997 --> 00:22:06.470
stars. You can see one planet
with rings and.

8d9a6442-b52c-4922-8ea9-a8e4d1bd8bdf-0
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.890
And and.

2cbc36dd-69f9-4013-87dc-cbf9c4812ea2-0
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:15.890
Maybe a dense nebula, maybe the
like the Milky Way. So it's a

2cbc36dd-69f9-4013-87dc-cbf9c4812ea2-1
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:21.380
peaceful but maybe slightly
threatening scene because of the

2cbc36dd-69f9-4013-87dc-cbf9c4812ea2-2
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.980
way these fish are looking at
the boat.

9a0b08f9-144d-4dd5-921d-ee2910629282-0
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.967
Now we see a close up of the
boat and these fish are really

9a0b08f9-144d-4dd5-921d-ee2910629282-1
00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:39.234
packed in around it. They're all
there are, there are hundreds of

9a0b08f9-144d-4dd5-921d-ee2910629282-2
00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:40.910
them and they're all.

a810c42f-cffb-4242-bb24-569b50d517b3-0
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.967
Packed around the boat, looking
at it intently from every

a810c42f-cffb-4242-bb24-569b50d517b3-1
00:22:46.967 --> 00:22:47.590
direction.

ea380a0f-905e-43d7-aa34-ecc6c7351dab-0
00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.541
Now the boat is is floating in
more open water. There are a few

ea380a0f-905e-43d7-aa34-ecc6c7351dab-1
00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:04.720
fish around, but not as many as
there were before and.

f7968922-138c-4736-a170-43252ef6d42b-0
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:11.474
It's still a night scene and
there are these curtains of

f7968922-138c-4736-a170-43252ef6d42b-1
00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:14.650
light up in the up in the sky.

b1b4735a-39ce-4d4c-a9ae-7b23f2500b68-0
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.300
With.

63a6e26d-e5f9-4dbf-af68-ce92a2fee7a5-0
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.055
The the the lower edge of the of
the curtain is. It's brighter

63a6e26d-e5f9-4dbf-af68-ce92a2fee7a5-1
00:23:25.055 --> 00:23:28.940
and it's almost as if the
curtain is made-up of.

fc0ab12f-d6cf-45e2-9673-a1a4a19ee4d3-0
00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:36.550
Vertical filaments with, that
are that are.

5cfd3690-b906-4aed-91ad-734b7d3166ea-0
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.484
A brighter or thicker at the
bottom so that there's this kind

5cfd3690-b906-4aed-91ad-734b7d3166ea-1
00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:42.730
of.

e4d75047-43c5-4450-abca-40bed592b09b-0
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.208
This fringe effect and these
curtains are just hanging in the

e4d75047-43c5-4450-abca-40bed592b09b-1
00:23:51.208 --> 00:23:56.215
night sky there and they're
somewhat translucent because you

e4d75047-43c5-4450-abca-40bed592b09b-2
00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:58.760
can see the stars through them.

376e639a-89e3-4073-a4a4-375325da9be8-0
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.964
And now they bought is
approaching a large iceberg

376e639a-89e3-4073-a4a4-375325da9be8-1
00:24:07.964 --> 00:24:11.770
which is floating them in the
water.

8ee88d26-9c5c-43ce-9d0b-1d23c788e37e-0
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.950
The iceberg is is triangular,
has a wedge kind of shape.

d066ecee-8a46-4d7f-a279-b31c2b10599b-0
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.360


2841af54-154a-4aed-b7f4-09bc534ed07b-0
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.460
And the the little boat is now.

033878fd-3170-4235-b859-16c63875fadc-0
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:33.560
This is, this is 2 images, are
on the left. The boat is.

47b18220-f90a-4d09-bd52-03a122dd2481-0
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:41.840
It's floating in a in a in a sea
with with patches of ice and

47b18220-f90a-4d09-bd52-03a122dd2481-1
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.250
it's seems to be passing under.

1c9415d8-7275-45e5-a162-e8d41806e943-0
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:51.880
An arch. Maybe it's a an opening
in the in the iceberg.

5f28deac-49b5-4e4f-868c-a51246eacdda-0
00:24:54.290 --> 00:25:00.120
And in the right hand picture,
it's gone further into the this

5f28deac-49b5-4e4f-868c-a51246eacdda-1
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.674
network of tunnels which we
assume is is is under the under

5f28deac-49b5-4e4f-868c-a51246eacdda-2
00:25:05.674 --> 00:25:10.857
the iceberg and it's it's
winding its way through these

5f28deac-49b5-4e4f-868c-a51246eacdda-3
00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:11.690
archways.

bf106f78-d064-4360-8b22-c880b2ad26b2-0
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.721
{Excuse me, I just have to have
a little drink of water. OK? I'm

bf106f78-d064-4360-8b22-c880b2ad26b2-1
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:21.263
getting a little getting a
little horse. Just hold on a

bf106f78-d064-4360-8b22-c880b2ad26b2-2
00:25:21.263 --> 00:25:21.579
SEC.}

dc74ad4e-cb9b-43d8-b896-c4957ae28138-0
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.100


68a8a0f0-6a2b-4057-a851-22bbdcc84eb1-0
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.370
OK, so now again two scenes on
this page.

59de9992-82bc-4793-8525-781a3a1daa96-0
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.870
We see.

74045404-7009-4df0-b296-3b3d91251e44-0
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.680
The the boat.

83406400-9d16-4a7f-a819-b9a92130a05f-0
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.656
It's on the outside, I think of
the of the iceberg. Maybe it's

83406400-9d16-4a7f-a819-b9a92130a05f-1
00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:47.050
passed through and there is a.

820afabc-5ff5-4211-9521-5ba3a9ca47c3-0
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:54.475
A lamp that has come out of the
sea and is shining its light on

820afabc-5ff5-4211-9521-5ba3a9ca47c3-1
00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:56.120
this on this boat.

025b0ac7-5d93-4089-9b29-dff9192a6bb7-0
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.100
Umm.

3ae50696-a392-438e-9c60-2ea04f604fef-0
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.920
And in the right hand page we
see.

e5305434-a38c-4950-b5cf-5a4cb61106bb-0
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.190
Umm.

e54fef9c-4a9c-488c-8709-b94ef6355780-0
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.880
A creature.

4173a3ad-14e9-4020-98b5-358093c93981-0
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:17.650
That, uh, that looks like a
diver, but it's really.

b787ab39-a51e-483b-afcb-a91ac253f751-0
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:25.315
More like a fish. It's got a
tank, ohh a kind of a air tank

b787ab39-a51e-483b-afcb-a91ac253f751-1
00:26:25.315 --> 00:26:30.674
on on its back. It's got a a
hose which goes up to the

b787ab39-a51e-483b-afcb-a91ac253f751-2
00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:32.720
surface there, there.

cc2fa8dc-a860-4d0b-9d80-321ab4e2344b-0
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:41.735
And it it's got, it's got fishy
like hands in which it's holding

cc2fa8dc-a860-4d0b-9d80-321ab4e2344b-1
00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:43.140
the little boat.

6634bfd7-a3cb-4e09-a697-3b786bbfe4ad-0
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.900
There are.

1cbc4bf1-1992-4a85-a6e5-12ac1a6f23c3-0
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.930
Umm.

704e10ee-8efc-4cb7-a3c2-92af8605be89-0
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.474
There are holes in its helmet
and it looks like there is water

704e10ee-8efc-4cb7-a3c2-92af8605be89-1
00:26:53.474 --> 00:26:58.587
pouring out of the holes in the
helmets. It has the number 08 on

704e10ee-8efc-4cb7-a3c2-92af8605be89-2
00:26:58.587 --> 00:27:00.160
that on that helmet.

97ffc496-0a9a-4604-b410-3ed49527f3d2-0
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.696
So it's it's it's like it's a
diver, but it's really made out

97ffc496-0a9a-4604-b410-3ed49527f3d2-1
00:27:05.696 --> 00:27:07.580
of fish and that there's a.

fd892c41-32a6-4ae2-b92f-beb8ccc1eb7d-0
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.465
That light that was shining on
the boat, we we see it's still

fd892c41-32a6-4ae2-b92f-beb8ccc1eb7d-1
00:27:14.465 --> 00:27:16.410
shining on the boat, but the

3660562b-2dc9-4765-adf7-acf9229db0e8-0
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.030
The cord or the

a4910c2a-4b97-431f-90a4-430f4e46adaa-0
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.206
Of of the light the the bracket
of the the light is is now going

a4910c2a-4b97-431f-90a4-430f4e46adaa-1
00:27:26.206 --> 00:27:30.431
up to the top of the picture.
It's not clear how it's

a4910c2a-4b97-431f-90a4-430f4e46adaa-2
00:27:30.431 --> 00:27:35.204
supported, and there are in fact
there are a couple of these

a4910c2a-4b97-431f-90a4-430f4e46adaa-3
00:27:35.204 --> 00:27:40.212
lights on flexible stalks which
are one one is shining off into

a4910c2a-4b97-431f-90a4-430f4e46adaa-4
00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:41.230
the distance.

5c98a408-a58a-4e7c-b407-9227a605d44d-0
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.990
And and down below, there's
there's something.

ecad0fce-68ab-4362-a31c-978f657cf5af-0
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.950
Else with a number 05 on it that
is as a similar.

b55c36f5-11cd-457b-ab3e-efa5c9daa87d-0
00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.318
set of holes, maybe it's another
creature like this with water

b55c36f5-11cd-457b-ab3e-efa5c9daa87d-1
00:28:00.318 --> 00:28:04.470
coming out of the the holes that
look like they're in the place

b55c36f5-11cd-457b-ab3e-efa5c9daa87d-2
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.990
of eyes.

806ea47e-e0e7-4e0e-a2cb-6f01b6434b02-0
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.110
It's.

859056c9-3aec-4ca8-a997-933127292054-0
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:07.770
Right.

c0d91fc5-c52d-4938-97bf-2b6cec3f2cdc-0
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.240
And now

5e4a399a-8c78-4c1a-ac48-d8eeac896762-0
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:21.075
Little boat and one of these
flexible stalks with a light on

5e4a399a-8c78-4c1a-ac48-d8eeac896762-1
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:21.360
it.

27101f55-5d46-4d11-aad9-b8a06f4a84cb-0
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.370
Is approaching 2.

7fbb4ec2-c647-4c5c-af3d-2378142c79ee-0
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.950
Large. Oh no.

17cd9da5-8ce7-4c46-bd38-105f56642d99-0
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.115
Yes, this is a single picture.
It's it's approaching 2 large

17cd9da5-8ce7-4c46-bd38-105f56642d99-1
00:28:36.115 --> 00:28:36.670
ships.

5a9b4ed0-1859-48b7-a849-51e4116e9fe8-0
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.100
One of the ships is spewing a
lot of dark.

47919f40-494f-4ca9-8647-1faa7e4696f5-0
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.000
Smoke, it has a.

7ad89c96-3d6e-4754-971a-c3901012bede-0
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.830
Harpoon gun on its prow and
anchors hanging down.

67c4a0a4-993a-4eea-b9ce-37eee44d26f4-0
00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:01.713
That's further away. The one on
the right is is closer towards

67c4a0a4-993a-4eea-b9ce-37eee44d26f4-1
00:29:01.713 --> 00:29:07.850
you. You see a set of doors in
the water line of the ship.

dcad5195-a882-4c51-882b-46a817569030-0
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.510
And.

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-0
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.238
There are these curious bulges
in the side of the the ship.

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-1
00:29:16.238 --> 00:29:20.167
It's you'd almost think they
were they were baskets hanging

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-2
00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:24.357
down but they look like they're
part of the structure of the of

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-3
00:29:24.357 --> 00:29:28.089
the the ship and it too is
belching very dark smoke. You

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-4
00:29:28.089 --> 00:29:32.280
see its anchor and and in fact
you see those doors in the water

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-5
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.536
line at the other ship although
it's further away and so they're

b15f9b69-57d6-459e-9222-5e68ece98de9-6
00:29:36.536 --> 00:29:37.060
smaller.

16dc381c-063f-47f0-bed8-50239556deb4-0
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:43.522
You see the wake, but anyway the
the the little boat is just

16dc381c-063f-47f0-bed8-50239556deb4-1
00:29:43.522 --> 00:29:47.530
approaching these, so let's see
what's next.

22461a91-a57b-44f1-bdae-a3afe0aac0b4-0
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.500
Now.

2db0ed71-8902-4d25-9daa-6474ae51d7d7-0
00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.310
His again, there are two scenes
here.

35926b10-792c-4d52-8a3f-94aef9dfeaec-0
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.490
Umm.

16dc2596-653a-4142-a264-3629ffaa4375-0
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.750
In one, little boat is.

9aa787b8-8b18-4c54-95c1-b3e478714c9b-0
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.926
Going under a dark night sky
with many clouds, there are

9aa787b8-8b18-4c54-95c1-b3e478714c9b-1
00:30:08.926 --> 00:30:10.940
birds which mostly seem to be.

0f64f681-4b84-4ae7-bcb4-ac0d87827b39-0
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:17.585
Falling down, diving into the
water, one has dived into the

0f64f681-4b84-4ae7-bcb4-ac0d87827b39-1
00:30:17.585 --> 00:30:23.040
boat and you see it hanging over
the over the side, but mostly

0f64f681-4b84-4ae7-bcb4-ac0d87827b39-2
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.630
they're just diving into the
water and on the right.

3ee3678d-056d-4cf6-857d-09c7e3c439a3-0
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.890
Uh.

e9460f34-c398-463b-8cb1-a94e44514d95-0
00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.770
I can't even see the little boat
in this one, but.

f3789fc0-9a03-4eb4-b098-a9dcf501a0e4-0
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.350
Again, birds are flying down,
but the the main thing is that

f3789fc0-9a03-4eb4-b098-a9dcf501a0e4-1
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:48.460
it's a it's a big oil drilling
platform, belching, belching,

f3789fc0-9a03-4eb4-b098-a9dcf501a0e4-2
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.769
lots of smoke, and it has
cranes, one of which has a

f3789fc0-9a03-4eb4-b098-a9dcf501a0e4-3
00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:54.370
large.

e65bd8b8-c369-4360-8bdd-409e65b6dfeb-0
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.980
Fish at the end of the of the
crane.

61a7221e-8bb3-45a6-ba12-39586152eedc-0
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.330
So now.

73720639-7937-44b2-a175-d2840b89f90a-0
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.710
The little you we see the little
boat again.

d19acca2-40b8-4ed3-93f1-ad34c2c54505-0
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:11.940
And.

824a3efe-4b8e-4016-919a-cca2c152653a-0
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.920
I think it has approached the
the oil drilling.

e33b2548-f9d4-4a1f-980d-ef25cad3e97e-0
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.670
Platform.

59bb09cf-a766-4aae-aae9-8b1ec80c4b75-0
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.860
And in this platform there are a
series of windows.

d7e72e06-4b94-4459-8022-e4ddb2d1908f-0
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.230
Out of which there are.

39c01853-ac20-444e-bbe2-403845ba33da-0
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.450
Creatures.

5db29887-ce2d-42e9-bbc2-45818516be5f-0
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.856
Who are who are shooting rifles,
one of which hits the little

5db29887-ce2d-42e9-bbc2-45818516be5f-1
00:31:38.856 --> 00:31:43.580
boat and goes through the the,
the top and.

aeb76673-18fb-44ec-8503-f9c095f08dde-0
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.840
There's also a.

d2763841-dfe1-41ee-bd39-1f120dcbe4a7-0
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:54.983
I don't know. Uh, it's like a
jet ski combined with a a paddle

d2763841-dfe1-41ee-bd39-1f120dcbe4a7-1
00:31:54.983 --> 00:32:01.663
steamer. It's, it's it's like a
almost like a a a motor bike for

d2763841-dfe1-41ee-bd39-1f120dcbe4a7-2
00:32:01.663 --> 00:32:05.260
the for the sea with a with a
man.

2b23aa56-d76a-41bc-add1-63d3f0508469-0
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.465
On it. And they're, they're,
these people are shooting at

2b23aa56-d76a-41bc-add1-63d3f0508469-1
00:32:09.465 --> 00:32:09.700
that.

9251364d-88fb-4bf5-a2a0-2bec07ad69b1-0
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.470
That craft too, and we also see
a big grappling.

e6216e2f-15d0-445b-b336-e1613154d9cf-0
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:19.880
Hook.

3ea76458-bd22-4905-8781-f4de4752f230-0
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.123
Which is hanging down from this
platform above the surface of

3ea76458-bd22-4905-8781-f4de4752f230-1
00:32:26.123 --> 00:32:30.282
the sea. And maybe in the
background there are there are

3ea76458-bd22-4905-8781-f4de4752f230-2
00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:34.660
big sea creatures. Sea monsters,
they're they're indistinct

3ea76458-bd22-4905-8781-f4de4752f230-3
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.820
though. And then the right hand
portion of this picture.

4f789af0-5e4a-4da1-836d-4d2abb62ff0f-0
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.390
We see.

a722f49f-99bb-4c2a-9795-3c85a1a958dc-0
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:47.080
The the man who had been driving
this craft.

6f0c8059-41f8-4fb3-a799-e4955b7eae42-0
00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:54.316
It looks like the craft is about
to to sink. The the tank on top

6f0c8059-41f8-4fb3-a799-e4955b7eae42-1
00:32:54.316 --> 00:32:58.180
of it, which probably held the
the fuel is.

aadff845-487e-49a0-8217-c7eeaf85d5e5-0
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:05.519
Is sparks or coming out of it.
That looks like the the the

aadff845-487e-49a0-8217-c7eeaf85d5e5-1
00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:11.656
craft is about to sink. The man
is standing on the end of the

aadff845-487e-49a0-8217-c7eeaf85d5e5-2
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:17.990
craft, which is tilted up, but
the little boat's there, you see

aadff845-487e-49a0-8217-c7eeaf85d5e5-3
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.959
the hole and its and its sail.

64eeb52e-04a2-4e9d-aa50-a726dfe27a3a-0
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:28.120
That they, the men have made,
but it has a a.

235be285-f9ba-4277-a1f9-0a8711b630e8-0
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:33.420
A life preserver a one of those
rings.

a1ea3dc4-20f0-43a1-b6ed-774faac6b3a3-0
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.150
And it's.

0def219b-7bd8-4702-9358-3bfdb699111a-0
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.644
Presumably gonna offer that to
the man whose craft is is

0def219b-7bd8-4702-9358-3bfdb699111a-1
00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:42.310
sinking.

36912ed5-687b-4f7c-aa69-039e1ce4ff92-0
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:55.308
And, and now indeed, we see that
the the man has has has got into

36912ed5-687b-4f7c-aa69-039e1ce4ff92-1
00:33:55.308 --> 00:34:01.187
the life preserver ring. He's in
the seas, being towed by this

36912ed5-687b-4f7c-aa69-039e1ce4ff92-2
00:34:01.187 --> 00:34:02.680
little boat and.

611baa91-2583-40f9-b3dd-ea2475a62046-0
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.850
No.

e1cae366-27fa-4706-a494-51c15a1566a6-0
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.460
Trying to see whether this is a.

4448b4f6-a793-4f0b-85bc-673d35173aca-0
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:17.329
This, this is 2 there's two
distinct pictures actually, but

4448b4f6-a793-4f0b-85bc-673d35173aca-1
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:22.631
on the left that we have the man
being towed by the boat with the

4448b4f6-a793-4f0b-85bc-673d35173aca-2
00:34:22.631 --> 00:34:27.289
sea and very stormy looking sea,
and on the right we see.

52d17e36-ea80-4377-8479-07b47a1308e7-0
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:39.280
We see a really weird scene.
There, there is a a boat.

e6c787a4-d82d-44d6-8461-a48387878b59-0
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:46.696
There are. There's a, there's a
mast, there are creatures. Looks

e6c787a4-d82d-44d6-8461-a48387878b59-1
00:34:46.696 --> 00:34:52.127
like the the the demon from the
from the first page. Instead of

e6c787a4-d82d-44d6-8461-a48387878b59-2
00:34:52.127 --> 00:34:53.570
a a sail, it has.

b9b2fc25-86db-4f38-8780-414ff87b2be5-0
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.336
A kite but but it seems to be
going. They are the opposite way

b9b2fc25-86db-4f38-8780-414ff87b2be5-1
00:34:59.336 --> 00:35:02.570
from which the kite would be
pulling. There are.

d29866c1-033f-464a-8697-0ba4e23daae7-0
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.000
Umm.

d866ca83-3e36-4daa-9ce6-9e9682617545-0
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.116
Oh no, it's it's going away.
It's going to the right. And

d866ca83-3e36-4daa-9ce6-9e9682617545-1
00:35:10.116 --> 00:35:14.090
because you see the rudder on
the back of the craft and

d866ca83-3e36-4daa-9ce6-9e9682617545-2
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.709
hanging over the back, there's a
horse with spots.

dc1b55ff-3002-4759-8aa0-3f18c6093f1a-0
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.590
A deer with a big rack of
antlers.

a89eef7c-c6cc-406b-9513-454b0d0d8416-0
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:32.190
Looks like a zebra with, with,
with checkers.

e83e07f0-19c0-4e22-9d77-f11403900d81-0
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:40.552
A ghost like creature. So maybe
other two aliens looking over

e83e07f0-19c0-4e22-9d77-f11403900d81-1
00:35:40.552 --> 00:35:43.390
the edge of this this craft.

ea744c5c-8f8a-4df0-947a-9a31c1aa19bc-0
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:49.997
And something with a elephant,
no that's a tail. So there are,

ea744c5c-8f8a-4df0-947a-9a31c1aa19bc-1
00:35:49.997 --> 00:35:54.984
there are, there are lots of
weird creatures, all but there's

ea744c5c-8f8a-4df0-947a-9a31c1aa19bc-2
00:35:54.984 --> 00:35:59.809
a normal looking cat also on the
mast of this of this ship.

e0b59b17-7c25-43f7-a4fe-244487395388-0
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:05.200
Anyway, it is proceeding to the
to the right.

e074424a-0230-4607-a6b6-70f7e5e8ee38-0
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:16.526
And now we see a big wave, a big
breaking wave and the little

e074424a-0230-4607-a6b6-70f7e5e8ee38-1
00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:21.540
boat, little paper boat is going
up the the.

0c207d2d-d28c-4486-8432-a39b10776a45-0
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:26.282
The the the front of this
breaking wave, it looks like

0c207d2d-d28c-4486-8432-a39b10776a45-1
00:36:26.282 --> 00:36:28.090
it's going to get swamped.

955c2de8-9313-43a7-87b3-483596a67149-0
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.400
Um and.

36c5d49b-7da1-4ebf-9a9f-bdad58d34961-0
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:37.691
We see that. I think this is
this is a single picture. On on

36c5d49b-7da1-4ebf-9a9f-bdad58d34961-1
00:36:37.691 --> 00:36:42.050
on this one, across both pages
we see that.

57416c18-881d-43cc-a9f3-c17da5295977-0
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.110
This boat.

b86a60e2-ab6e-4c25-a5b6-400d14b8cdb5-0
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:54.788
It's going away from from this,
from this wave. Its, the kite

b86a60e2-ab6e-4c25-a5b6-400d14b8cdb5-1
00:36:54.788 --> 00:37:01.070
that is its sail has has broken,
and there are two.

9f9ad2bf-f36a-4c5f-989e-f4a87f9e2e53-0
00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:08.467
Creatures that look, childlike,
the the the creatures. Maybe

9f9ad2bf-f36a-4c5f-989e-f4a87f9e2e53-1
00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:13.585
they're the ones who brought the
sail, not sure. But they're

9f9ad2bf-f36a-4c5f-989e-f4a87f9e2e53-2
00:37:13.585 --> 00:37:18.619
they're standing on the the ribs
of the of the of the kite.

db0ace88-4cb0-4ce1-9c49-c3c6f2603573-0
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.500
The.

0d54a598-03e0-4de4-a034-ac80e7ee66c6-0
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:28.366
Creature with horns is still on
the top of the the mast. The cat

0d54a598-03e0-4de4-a034-ac80e7ee66c6-1
00:37:28.366 --> 00:37:34.370
is walking along a a thin rope
towards the broken kite sail and

0d54a598-03e0-4de4-a034-ac80e7ee66c6-2
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:39.060
the other creatures that we saw
before are still.

1e50876c-e48a-4758-acd7-c86b4a780609-0
00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.740
On this this boat, one of them.

e50c57bf-98ff-495f-ab23-e16adef0ea46-0
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.290
One of the.

773a1909-9da4-4f63-a8da-24c40fe51083-0
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.040
Creatures with very strange.

83fe6265-cce3-41dd-b8ff-c95777982fd2-0
00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.604
Creature with strange horns and
strange nose has the has a wheel

83fe6265-cce3-41dd-b8ff-c95777982fd2-1
00:38:00.604 --> 00:38:06.865
steering wheel where he's trying
to to guide the this strange

83fe6265-cce3-41dd-b8ff-c95777982fd2-2
00:38:06.865 --> 00:38:07.370
boat.

2efbf603-55d7-4167-af8b-58e454b3ff59-0
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:21.138
And now we see there again two
scenes, one with the little

2efbf603-55d7-4167-af8b-58e454b3ff59-1
00:38:21.138 --> 00:38:21.600
boat.

bdd24dea-6128-4515-ad12-b48554094e22-0
00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:29.058
on a choppy sea and this there's
a thunderstorm. The Lightning is

bdd24dea-6128-4515-ad12-b48554094e22-1
00:38:29.058 --> 00:38:34.620
is arcing down from the from the
sky and striking the surface of

bdd24dea-6128-4515-ad12-b48554094e22-2
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.760
the sea and on the right.

ef732e64-a4d5-4eeb-ab02-9826628d1510-0
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.100
We see a paper airplane.

da81c22b-901b-4740-a111-7e3ae4912863-0
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.915
Zooming through a a dark sky
above the surface of the of the

da81c22b-901b-4740-a111-7e3ae4912863-1
00:38:49.915 --> 00:38:51.070
choppy ocean.

d2bb4d72-1d4d-4f3e-b7d7-1a5c79d0e1ec-0
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.100
Two scenes again.

139e60a2-0e9a-48da-bea9-5651d73c1917-0
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.850
The little boats is.

2c142f6d-cda4-460a-861a-bd8f803d6a17-0
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.790
Approaching.

f3f58098-7b3a-4a93-9d30-fd5ca9455750-0
00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:11.852
A series of arches. One's, one
suspects that these arches are

f3f58098-7b3a-4a93-9d30-fd5ca9455750-1
00:39:11.852 --> 00:39:17.410
in fact a serpent like sea
creature, or one or more serpent

f3f58098-7b3a-4a93-9d30-fd5ca9455750-2
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:23.338
like sea creatures. This little
boat is going under the arch of

f3f58098-7b3a-4a93-9d30-fd5ca9455750-3
00:39:23.338 --> 00:39:24.450
one of them.

df0b61d0-6080-4d2f-8133-c018658b545c-0
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.700
And and the right hand we see.

b53f5dfa-1c20-48f0-83b3-3e5c02204dd7-0
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.690
A tentacle.

31dcd009-2726-4b75-a766-c175551093cc-0
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:35.800
Uh.

ad67382f-c6ba-4f34-96a7-b4143fce59d6-0
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.992
Of of this the sea creature, you
know, but one of one of the

ad67382f-c6ba-4f34-96a7-b4143fce59d6-1
00:39:41.992 --> 00:39:47.514
arches has has raised its end
up, and we see it. It's in fact

ad67382f-c6ba-4f34-96a7-b4143fce59d6-2
00:39:47.514 --> 00:39:52.680
a creature with a tentacle or or
even a mouth. And it is.

f4b543e5-3109-45a3-a652-9fd4617f92c3-0
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.540
Holding.

a5266af9-9282-468d-b1fa-bef81f281e49-0
00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.126
A piece of paper and and it
looks more like the paper

a5266af9-9282-468d-b1fa-bef81f281e49-1
00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:04.779
airplane than the paper boat. So
maybe it's snagged it from the

a5266af9-9282-468d-b1fa-bef81f281e49-2
00:40:04.779 --> 00:40:05.070
sky.

ced3806e-9e04-44e3-8c5b-80772c15deb0-0
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.500
We. We.

3c4b91f5-12e5-4aad-8d9f-21ed8035b302-0
00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.180
We now on the on the left hand
side we see.

c3677e14-9770-4e6b-bd2a-19101689c263-0
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.277
The head, So what and I I think
that's confirming that it was

c3677e14-9770-4e6b-bd2a-19101689c263-1
00:40:24.277 --> 00:40:25.090
more of a.

27ec6292-161d-4fe2-9eba-973cd66397c4-0
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:32.042
Head than a than actual tentacle
of of the sea creature. And it

27ec6292-161d-4fe2-9eba-973cd66397c4-1
00:40:32.042 --> 00:40:34.690
is, it is looking around and.

1b97834d-ca00-4eb2-aad6-b61576160ff0-0
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:42.235
It's it's probably looking at
the little paper boat which is

1b97834d-ca00-4eb2-aad6-b61576160ff0-1
00:40:42.235 --> 00:40:48.448
sailing in through the arches of
the of this sea creature. But

1b97834d-ca00-4eb2-aad6-b61576160ff0-2
00:40:48.448 --> 00:40:54.365
looking in and and following
what the little boat is doing,

1b97834d-ca00-4eb2-aad6-b61576160ff0-3
00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:58.310
we see two other creatures, one
with a.

a8a851c6-e2c6-4b45-99c6-5a38485d8059-0
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.820
A long Unicorn like horn.

fced1b59-1a2a-40b4-b661-07ee71a10c23-0
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.110
And one with a.

0c26d1bf-eef4-4d3a-8213-1c3ee85f0ea6-0
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:11.998
A long elephantine like snout,
both of which have glowing eyes

0c26d1bf-eef4-4d3a-8213-1c3ee85f0ea6-1
00:41:11.998 --> 00:41:17.025
and are watching the little the
little boat go in under these

0c26d1bf-eef4-4d3a-8213-1c3ee85f0ea6-2
00:41:17.025 --> 00:41:21.080
tentacle, under these arches of
the sea creature.

4bab4345-715b-4e09-826f-e44925f6d623-0
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.590
And now the scene changes again
as it's a single scene.

0a80b282-e288-4a3d-bb4d-7bcf38cc0628-0
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:39.000
The little boat is in the choppy
sea and.

9d3087ce-f23b-4b93-baf5-26f8b8154575-0
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:46.534
No it's not. It's two, it's two.
It's two scenes in the left hand

9d3087ce-f23b-4b93-baf5-26f8b8154575-1
00:41:46.534 --> 00:41:52.438
scene the we see that these two
creatures, the one with the long

9d3087ce-f23b-4b93-baf5-26f8b8154575-2
00:41:52.438 --> 00:41:57.615
Unicorn like horn and the one
with the elephantine spout

9d3087ce-f23b-4b93-baf5-26f8b8154575-3
00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:58.160
there.

570b7d3f-f039-4df4-9a5f-32f2971697dc-0
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.573
The the the secret for his this
serpent like sequencer is not

570b7d3f-f039-4df4-9a5f-32f2971697dc-1
00:42:04.573 --> 00:42:09.043
there anymore but out of the
nose of the Unicorn like

570b7d3f-f039-4df4-9a5f-32f2971697dc-2
00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:14.508
creature, 2 streams of water are
pouring and they're pouring into

570b7d3f-f039-4df4-9a5f-32f2971697dc-3
00:42:14.508 --> 00:42:19.723
the little paper boat and and
and are perhaps going to sink it

570b7d3f-f039-4df4-9a5f-32f2971697dc-4
00:42:19.723 --> 00:42:22.869
as the elephantine creature
looks on.

a1c3816c-c728-4f1c-9119-a70eb4d2211e-0
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.570
And then in the right-hand
picture we see a.

9c839b14-e17f-463b-8f60-4ea7c7f01121-0
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:38.081
Of a fish like creature but with
legs. So it's it's a kind of a

9c839b14-e17f-463b-8f60-4ea7c7f01121-1
00:42:38.081 --> 00:42:44.271
humanoid fish like creature
where they the arms are like

9c839b14-e17f-463b-8f60-4ea7c7f01121-2
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:51.114
fins and the legs are human like
except they have webbed feet.

9c839b14-e17f-463b-8f60-4ea7c7f01121-3
00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:55.350
It's standing on the shore, the
shore.

f54c0587-3b62-4223-a7b0-7f7cfc3338d2-0
00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:58.800
With a lot of.

3d1cbea0-e494-444e-a88e-92b0d8457eba-0
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.920
Junk, a bottle, A can, and and
some.

953e0cea-8cea-43de-8ca8-b5f95cfb50e0-0
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.290
Propeller like.

c9ea5aab-6565-467e-952e-4656bc9239ca-0
00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.430
debris.

5be2c75a-1b8a-4bff-8e2d-c4eb49f856d4-0
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:15.213
Looking out over to see where it
sees the little paper boat which

5be2c75a-1b8a-4bff-8e2d-c4eb49f856d4-1
00:43:15.213 --> 00:43:15.850
may be.

19988203-6fb4-454d-be89-e03b05796c5f-0
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.030
May be sinking that it looks
like it's partly under the sea.

29ce4e07-e9e2-4b56-a7b2-4a631daace56-0
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.980
OK.

d7354dab-e2e7-4aa6-84d8-c60402620e4a-0
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:32.311
And now the little boat actually
is sinking and you see it's it's

d7354dab-e2e7-4aa6-84d8-c60402620e4a-1
00:43:32.311 --> 00:43:36.843
I think it's under the water in
the midst of a whole bunch of of

d7354dab-e2e7-4aa6-84d8-c60402620e4a-2
00:43:36.843 --> 00:43:41.445
jellyfish and the little bubbles
are are coming out of it, moving

d7354dab-e2e7-4aa6-84d8-c60402620e4a-3
00:43:41.445 --> 00:43:42.840
towards the surface.

7d9ab7ed-a2e7-4bd7-bf1b-57c52c60793b-0
00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:50.800
And in the right hand picture we
see more jellyfish.

223c3d1e-ab9f-468f-ba66-6fad0382653b-0
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:52.800
1.

1b2e8eb7-8cda-44f3-a8cf-296f97ea774d-0
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.960
Big.

f86f42bc-3a40-4cf2-bf08-478093f6536e-0
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.294
Jellyfish like creature, but
which is not as transparent as

f86f42bc-3a40-4cf2-bf08-478093f6536e-1
00:44:02.294 --> 00:44:05.720
the other jellyfish and seems to
have more of a big body.

45be7272-60b4-4225-84c6-28c240723390-0
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.850
But we don't see the little ship
anymore.

8ef24e35-af6c-4c78-8da6-850b07cd5155-0
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.550
And now

94bc264a-0f50-47af-8466-a7aee4212df2-0
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:21.816
The ship is is floating again,
two scenes floating under the

94bc264a-0f50-47af-8466-a7aee4212df2-1
00:44:21.816 --> 00:44:26.930
water, and it seems to have
hooked up with a Shoal of fish

94bc264a-0f50-47af-8466-a7aee4212df2-2
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:32.043
or that kind of flattish fish
all going in the in the same

94bc264a-0f50-47af-8466-a7aee4212df2-3
00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:32.910
direction.

c14abe8a-9e87-4e2f-a66d-43a56d0323e2-0
00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.170


2b8b164a-399c-4e1c-ba25-15854747cc24-0
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.533
And there's one fish down below
this shoal kind of floating

2b8b164a-399c-4e1c-ba25-15854747cc24-1
00:44:40.533 --> 00:44:45.440
upside down, looking up and in
the right hand picture we have.

527dabcb-e135-4335-a0e2-b86c0d76a007-0
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:46.920
Uh.

3a9cf831-8776-4b52-9203-9e7d5b750a64-0
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.470
The paper boat.

2ba6d483-f48c-4b72-9297-ff0d274baf0e-0
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.080
Following a.

cdfe4bd8-348e-46d2-add3-01f9a7ee7f69-0
00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:56.960
I guess it's a. It's a.

1fda3837-fc80-43cc-b528-87c0bdd72fa2-0
00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.890
it's hard to tell. It's it's not
exactly a jellyfish it's.

db65892c-1f55-4dd4-8d91-8deca1a48a66-0
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.770
More of a.

49e71813-841b-46b9-92a2-c5034619517f-0
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.290
Octopus.

3c7d3793-9f50-430c-a5b5-a65b56f3723f-0
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.390
It's got tentacles. It's squid
like, I don't know, it's it's

3c7d3793-9f50-430c-a5b5-a65b56f3723f-1
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:18.774
it's weird. And then there are
there are other little sea

3c7d3793-9f50-430c-a5b5-a65b56f3723f-2
00:45:18.774 --> 00:45:19.530
creatures.

d62ed37f-4345-466f-9789-8b461cfc6c0b-0
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.940
Fishlike and.

e9767b8a-c272-4701-b301-2558b296935d-0
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.280
With.

96a3e6e2-89d5-4147-8aac-6231a13a6923-0
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.587
The kinds of things that propel
themselves by squirting water

96a3e6e2-89d5-4147-8aac-6231a13a6923-1
00:45:31.587 --> 00:45:32.380
out the back.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:34.650
And.

e9c07a60-7705-405b-a47d-b3be6da8df7e-0
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:37.920
OK.

3b5c9060-c3d6-4624-a554-2c589243b264-0
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.230
And now we.

1a849dc2-fc27-4903-8105-5ab1c5758f49-0
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.030
Let's see.

8d3fea41-f11e-4dd3-8a40-53b47b840539-0
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.470
Two scenes. One,

aea6d0be-9f0b-4848-b088-9d6211415d5c-0
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:54.780
There are.

7ba2332d-80d1-4783-ac69-f8435f92dae8-0
00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:02.759
Creatures that that that the the
paper boat is down on the floor

7ba2332d-80d1-4783-ac69-f8435f92dae8-1
00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:04.950
of the ocean there are.

ed729d0d-0737-4953-8a30-2056182b734b-0
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:06.810
Creatures.

c15bf522-9f23-4734-a2d0-61fb95ad2c8a-0
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.750
With many.

daad4bac-0334-4b21-a4d7-256f9f9bbac7-0
00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:17.392
Many legs and antenna coming out
of their heads and they're kind

daad4bac-0334-4b21-a4d7-256f9f9bbac7-1
00:46:17.392 --> 00:46:24.035
of swarming over the little boat
and this is a bright light, like

daad4bac-0334-4b21-a4d7-256f9f9bbac7-2
00:46:24.035 --> 00:46:27.860
a spotlight shining down on the
boat.

3fb9e4b7-7305-43b3-99a8-1faf6e52c6f4-0
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.810
And these creatures that are on
top of it.

dd79cd99-c362-4ce0-9704-b888e514430d-0
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.720
And then in the right hand
picture we see.

e3f94f69-55e9-44db-98cb-1ca98d4cc112-0
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.690
Submarine.

952bb354-9b8e-4d09-ae8d-1f63b6baae74-0
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.530
Which has.

8355f13a-830f-451f-b410-e4ae688f12db-0
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:46.790


f548656e-95bb-4619-86bd-62e6fc95e33b-0
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.080
Got the little

7f5977f0-22be-4172-8206-a62fd5ab8577-0
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.472
Paper boat on its nose and looks
like it may be going up back

7f5977f0-22be-4172-8206-a62fd5ab8577-1
00:46:55.472 --> 00:46:57.290
towards the surface.

fae4313d-9559-40fd-8ad8-727649de7d17-0
00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.160
There are.

6c1e4aad-8609-4759-bff7-682126ae6016-0
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.590
Fish swimming around the
submarine.

1addd232-b43d-4682-947e-d76b202dc371-0
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:13.220
With glowing eyes, the eyes make
a kind of.

89d1c737-279e-4cb0-b33c-1bee36e6dd6c-0
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:18.860
A V shape with the with the.

3d6e81ee-9c86-4722-9674-defa7e5ab4c1-0
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:25.727
The two eyes point in slightly
different directions and the

3d6e81ee-9c86-4722-9674-defa7e5ab4c1-1
00:47:25.727 --> 00:47:31.101
light makes it kind of V shape
in front of them. And underneath

3d6e81ee-9c86-4722-9674-defa7e5ab4c1-2
00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:36.222
all of this there is a a large
sea serpent that is observing

3d6e81ee-9c86-4722-9674-defa7e5ab4c1-3
00:47:36.222 --> 00:47:37.650
what is going on.

13569c10-b2b1-46df-9d46-0d3c58ed3ab2-0
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.720
So the the submarine gets to the
surface.

463d4060-5c5e-4f43-a4cf-6200c28d5740-0
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:51.615
With the little paper boat on
its nose so it's it comes above

463d4060-5c5e-4f43-a4cf-6200c28d5740-1
00:47:51.615 --> 00:47:58.200
the surface and the water pours
out of the little paper boat.

463d4060-5c5e-4f43-a4cf-6200c28d5740-2
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:04.678
They swing below the below the
submarine. And then the right

463d4060-5c5e-4f43-a4cf-6200c28d5740-3
00:48:04.678 --> 00:48:11.370
hand picture we see the little
paper bowl apparently floating.

7a00d456-7f96-4929-ac50-fc9594aeb15a-0
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.230
Along, uh, well, on its own.

7c41e0f2-36f4-41f4-b0c7-2afea309d7d5-0
00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.510
And it's next to a.

ddf23d46-0013-4ed7-87b9-ec4070d8a55c-0
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.240
A boat, maybe a fishing boat.

d1ab5510-4ba0-42c5-a5ea-7a6e000e33b6-0
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:34.600
With which is being attacked by
a giant squid.

88e0b184-be07-412b-b395-c637a9f783a7-0
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:41.310
With glowing eyes. And there's a
there's a man's standing on top

88e0b184-be07-412b-b395-c637a9f783a7-1
00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.100
of the cabin of this fishing
boat.

ec2c09c3-c341-42c7-98e7-402fc09fae28-0
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:50.190
And it's not looking that good
for the.

a3240cb4-d0da-488f-8587-2da6b71ec008-0
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:55.684
But the boat and one of the
tentacles of this squid has a,

a3240cb4-d0da-488f-8587-2da6b71ec008-1
00:48:55.684 --> 00:49:00.277
can't quite see what it is, but
it it's it's some kind of maybe

a3240cb4-d0da-488f-8587-2da6b71ec008-2
00:49:00.277 --> 00:49:04.583
it's something that it's taken
from the from the boat, some

a3240cb4-d0da-488f-8587-2da6b71ec008-3
00:49:04.583 --> 00:49:05.660
circular thing.

fb1563de-9ea1-4eaf-b68d-7a69db069ccb-0
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:17.590
Now we see some seals on the on
the left from one of the seals

fb1563de-9ea1-4eaf-b68d-7a69db069ccb-1
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:22.665
has got is bouncing the paper
boat on its nose while the

fb1563de-9ea1-4eaf-b68d-7a69db069ccb-2
00:49:22.665 --> 00:49:23.200
other.

afcba290-faa1-4829-9bb9-9048b4e73721-0
00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:27.640
3 seals look on in amazement
and.

c994e797-4e02-4d7f-b9b2-76e0d1e443e2-0
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.230
Umm.

611442fc-b6ef-428a-8700-178e80789325-0
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:37.250
Down, down below other seals are
doing graceful.

e9ee3a59-2045-453d-8337-1bef748781c8-0
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.980
Acrobatic moves.

f8cc747a-297b-4e2a-86f0-14992448c7b8-0
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.710
Under the water and then in the.

98d43186-0e87-4d5c-82f4-140041273805-0
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.640
Right hand picture.

98d97129-dd0c-48d2-8b48-60da32bbbc34-0
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.930
We see.

79e3eb9b-ef55-49bb-be90-4377e8113f38-0
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.950
kind of underwater.

cb88c69c-132e-4045-8a07-c3b93b5c2627-0
00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:01.190
Forest of seaweed the there's a
seal.

49ee846f-487c-4171-96e6-6bb9572caf41-0
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.863
Maybe it's the same picture, but
there's a discontinuity, so I

49ee846f-487c-4171-96e6-6bb9572caf41-1
00:50:05.863 --> 00:50:06.860
think it's 2 pictures.

c5175385-f31d-4b1f-8d63-1e19e43d32fd-0
00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:13.120
The the the forest with with
fish swimming.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.940
Through it and.

04fd97d8-82ae-4916-8abf-b3a1a61df1ef-0
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.010
Various vegetation growing
there.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.520
Now we see.

4487e8d3-ea6b-4a4e-bdbe-8a51ca81398a-0
00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.240
The little boat floating above.

cadfe1fa-2261-48b6-b634-5ecf6dea83ba-0
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:40.720
This underwater forest. There
are.

Jellyfish like creatures.

692abd46-8564-42e0-bf91-5e562054a8bb-0
00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.940
That's on the left hand picture.

af3b9ee4-8055-436a-8b83-bcced2dd6e95-0
00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:06.170
But on the right hand picture we
we see.

9315d65b-daf9-4747-93b3-1f8fa91c4946-0
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:09.980
A diver.

99bdd4af-b18c-4b7c-accf-3ae55f9ab370-0
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:12.910
From below the surface.

242ffed4-733e-4649-ad46-a66d36f5852c-0
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.030

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.538
And I'm trying to make out
whether this so there's a

0ab616f1-4dd1-42e9-a4c7-8fa78c0c1969-1
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:24.990
there's a creature or serpent
like.

f55b7656-4e49-48aa-94a1-501a83f1591f-0

Oh I see it's it's a Pearl
inside a giant clamshell that is

d65e03ec-c9cd-48fa-9b9d-fb62a8e89d1f-1
00:51:41.648 --> 00:51:48.619
much bigger than the man, and
and he is has jacked it open

d65e03ec-c9cd-48fa-9b9d-fb62a8e89d1f-2

used to open this thing. So.

0dbe85e9-e269-46b0-ba77-8ebb3c332ffc-0
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:06.437
He needs that because otherwise
it would close and and eat him

0dbe85e9-e269-46b0-ba77-8ebb3c332ffc-1
00:52:06.437 --> 00:52:11.977

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:47.368
A buoy, well, or little floating
lighthouses. It's bigger than

Other creatures climbing the
sides of this buoy and.

c7473bd1-8c16-4d1f-a91c-be6927de77aa-0
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.150
Uh, a

c56ec65a-7158-444c-9442-d9e4bdd449b4-0
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:22.610
Another creature sitting on the
edge of it and the little boat

c56ec65a-7158-444c-9442-d9e4bdd449b4-1
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:28.787
is kind of next to this and it's
looking at what's going on and

c56ec65a-7158-444c-9442-d9e4bdd449b4-2
00:53:28.787 --> 00:53:31.490
then on the right hand side.

006f08bc-a8d9-464b-a139-da86f17afa0f-0
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.385
The scene changes, and we see a
large lighthouse on a rock.

006f08bc-a8d9-464b-a139-da86f17afa0f-1
00:53:34.385 --> 00:53:36.983
There's a girl standing on the
rock at the foot of the

006f08bc-a8d9-464b-a139-da86f17afa0f-2
00:53:36.983 --> 00:53:39.866
lighthouse. And behind it is
another oddly shaped Dome, like

006f08bc-a8d9-464b-a139-da86f17afa0f-3
00:53:39.866 --> 00:53:42.937
almost like a a silo in the same
markings as the lighthouse, but

006f08bc-a8d9-464b-a139-da86f17afa0f-4
00:53:42.937 --> 00:53:44.780
it's not the lighthouse, and we
see a.

efbcd19e-7ef8-46ed-aa8b-5e04ca948268-0
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.510
Uh, a large

0a1e3edb-3d2c-4983-8afb-ba812503c553-0
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.150
Ship, A liner maybe, in the
background and the smaller ship

0a1e3edb-3d2c-4983-8afb-ba812503c553-1
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.598
on the on the right and the
little boat is floating by

0a1e3edb-3d2c-4983-8afb-ba812503c553-2
00:53:55.598 --> 00:53:57.040
looking at all of this.

c9fe4f07-940a-49ef-b634-5ee6f2becf7e-0
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.970
And now we see.

aa083a48-753d-481c-982b-5e368e1db4c0-0
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:05.970
A pier.

a10ba7be-6480-4dcb-bc83-c8275e314aea-0
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:16.110
A pier that, very long pier that
goes out from the from the

a10ba7be-6480-4dcb-bc83-c8275e314aea-1
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:16.920
shore.

bfcc20ac-6ada-410c-9a54-74a3a0a2cc6a-0
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:24.923
It's actually two scenes because
of this. It's it's, it's

bfcc20ac-6ada-410c-9a54-74a3a0a2cc6a-1
00:54:24.923 --> 00:54:30.586
disconnected. But on the left
hand side we see the edge, we we

bfcc20ac-6ada-410c-9a54-74a3a0a2cc6a-2
00:54:30.586 --> 00:54:35.349
see the end of the pier, which
is circular in shape.

9598ba31-0543-4285-942e-c0dff615fcc6-0
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:42.592
And we see it above and below
the water line and the little

9598ba31-0543-4285-942e-c0dff615fcc6-1
00:54:42.592 --> 00:54:47.990
boat is is floating past it and
then the right hand side we see.

3031088c-0cc4-4f66-99d6-ed303e0af7d6-0
00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:56.443
The the long arm of the pier as
it comes out from the from the

3031088c-0cc4-4f66-99d6-ed303e0af7d6-1
00:54:56.443 --> 00:54:57.170
shore.

6505ad5d-e41b-4c0e-98d0-0d5910a4cef5-0
00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.860
With um.

6ddffa3c-0ba0-49da-8f8f-add71ebd2ea6-0
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:08.086
a couple of boats going along
the side of it. There is a a

6ddffa3c-0ba0-49da-8f8f-add71ebd2ea6-1
00:55:08.086 --> 00:55:11.990
huge tall sailing ship with a.

43d0933f-e3f4-4530-b181-172d2b04e968-0
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:18.710
With some kind of creature on on
top of it.

3fc6ef40-a8b5-43c1-9b7b-53e622b390b8-0
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.180
it's got wings or.

2ff5b561-cd64-454b-922d-89cf2539b3e0-0
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:25.700
Something it's hard to see, it's
it's quite small.

ee6ca4c9-cdc2-456a-90a3-2347c9de3dda-0
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.340
And uh.

9189b97a-159d-48cc-8c0b-5fd676ac3d83-0
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.560
Fish and seaweed.

3e6696e2-5da1-4366-aafd-58d31f8fb052-0
00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.650
Below.

c5c2efc8-dd71-4e68-b18f-0cd8f9f94908-0
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.530
The little boat is not in that
scene.

7b50973e-6392-412d-bc7b-4b7515e581e9-0
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.300
And now we see.

03e04a6f-3d34-412f-bec3-5ec1ddae5a55-0
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.850
The little boat.

83d034c4-14cc-4002-907b-e3e299f0d288-0
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.660
By the side of a of a huge boat
with a with a.

955b7ddf-49e6-4a23-9a54-ce6f55329ab4-0
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:57.680
Bulbous

eaf731a4-dfc7-4d13-8fa9-83988ba157aa-0
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:00.650
prow beneath the.

c385f3cc-2c5f-497d-bdef-031bd316fe14-0
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.746
The water and you don't even see
the top of the boat, but you do

c385f3cc-2c5f-497d-bdef-031bd316fe14-1
00:56:05.746 --> 00:56:07.590
see the the anchor on its side.

ec844ba7-5503-44f4-a583-45443d067770-0
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.290
There's a.

afe73015-3201-40c2-b2c5-3280cc68779d-0
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.020
A smaller.

1b028fd5-a354-4912-999c-ce3c2ae826d9-0
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.680
boat with a I don't know. It's
a, it's a.

f7539dff-cb88-4d63-b679-cd6309f49915-0
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:18.930


741e5679-dd66-440c-b045-b145f13c9302-0
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.040
Maybe a a fan or a wind
propeller that is.

352998aa-fc69-41c6-a0e4-d1a2cb8f27a0-0
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.540
Helping the boat boat move,
although it does have a regular.

00090eec-8a54-4fc1-9506-118a18fbce50-0
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:34.410
propeller. But it's it's.

0fbd8f8e-107e-44c4-881f-b144df2f284f-0
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.144
It's much smaller than the than
the huge boat, although much

0fbd8f8e-107e-44c4-881f-b144df2f284f-1
00:56:39.144 --> 00:56:40.880
bigger than the paper boat and.

6362ccb0-358a-44dc-8d22-3e315d5e5d3a-0
00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:50.008
Behind that is a a small sailing
boat which I don't know whether

6362ccb0-358a-44dc-8d22-3e315d5e5d3a-1
00:56:50.008 --> 00:56:55.040
it's being towed by this medium
sized boat or.

01514f2e-1e8b-4050-9edc-ab8cea7dd3df-0
00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.627
But it's it's it's in a strange
angle. It's got its prow angled

01514f2e-1e8b-4050-9edc-ab8cea7dd3df-1
00:57:00.627 --> 00:57:04.846
up towards the stern of this
medium sized boat. Medium sized

01514f2e-1e8b-4050-9edc-ab8cea7dd3df-2
00:57:04.846 --> 00:57:08.720
boat has an interesting
projection on the bottom, which

01514f2e-1e8b-4050-9edc-ab8cea7dd3df-3
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.450
is like a an observation.

ebe599b5-5771-46c7-8083-7f17b8a3c7c1-0
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.300
bulge which allows people to go
down and see.

8cf7bf4e-002d-4787-8636-1c411c1978f7-0
00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:21.993
In the background and under the
water we see the the submarine

8cf7bf4e-002d-4787-8636-1c411c1978f7-1
00:57:21.993 --> 00:57:26.430
from before with this
distinctive check pattern.

19f8f3b0-a6e5-4260-8aec-45f2f1c8f745-0
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.200
And again two scenes. One is.

c2d2b0a9-bd23-4dd7-859e-72fddbff6b5f-0
00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.100
Um.

2add84b5-35bc-4784-8153-569a379f4a3a-0
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:46.586
Uh, whale like creature it's got
it's got the pipe from before,

2add84b5-35bc-4784-8153-569a379f4a3a-1
00:57:46.586 --> 00:57:49.790
so we saw this before. It's got
some.

52d2e15f-755e-4bfc-a017-66817c4bc5b9-0
00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:54.610
A tank on the back. It's got one
of these.

8bb7a089-1822-4c84-a01e-4b939a768e4f-0
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.920
Looks like it's a a shower.

8f11c48c-fb8b-4e2a-9b41-e8be71784cf4-0
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:07.808
Putting water on the top of this
this creature, there's a man on

8f11c48c-fb8b-4e2a-9b41-e8be71784cf4-1
00:58:07.808 --> 00:58:12.370
the end of a large kind of
cherry picker type.

bcb2b49a-dd75-4bd1-8ee3-febcfc3de466-0
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:18.090
Thing going up towards this this
creature.

8c4eabc1-4edf-443e-83de-345cf19ed462-0
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:25.864
Two men in a small boat by the
side of a medium sized boat, the

8c4eabc1-4edf-443e-83de-345cf19ed462-1
00:58:25.864 --> 00:58:26.960
to the right.

cb91adc4-c8f1-4e36-8ac8-976c2f6a800f-0
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:34.100
And and oh and it's a it's a
dock and this creature has two

cb91adc4-c8f1-4e36-8ac8-976c2f6a800f-1
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.811
small feet which is put on the
the the dock and the the the

cb91adc4-c8f1-4e36-8ac8-976c2f6a800f-2
00:58:39.811 --> 00:58:45.713
bulk of it is still in in the
water and the guy in the cherry

cb91adc4-c8f1-4e36-8ac8-976c2f6a800f-3
00:58:45.713 --> 00:58:51.519
picker is I guess going up to
investigate what this creature

cb91adc4-c8f1-4e36-8ac8-976c2f6a800f-4
00:58:51.519 --> 00:58:57.040
is all about and on the right
hand side we see two large.

2e9af02d-37d4-43ea-a275-4ca5340123e6-0
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.590
Liners.

e65f5f92-3082-4b7c-a286-584859a2d6ed-0

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.880
There were people lining the
decks.

6085b5fc-8be0-47c5-9536-ef426fb44361-0
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:25.960

00:59:46.184 --> 00:59:47.150
the water.

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:52.589
There's an industrial scene in
the in the background with

096bcc7f-6360-4fcb-87a5-c3501730ef81-1
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:53.230

fe5acdb0-6b27-48c2-bdcc-53d6410a9863-0
01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:35.430
Umm.

60c27b11-8d1c-4aad-8b58-0085dc632510-0
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.780
Well, it looks kind of like the
submarine.

e241af20-0a81-4e88-bd34-cbb88f2c4a49-0
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.230
With a.

c6c351d0-fbb4-45e5-936d-b0049eafe3e4-0
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:50.210
A man and a steering wheel in a
in this bulbous.

10442883-6598-48c9-b0f9-da9e3aac1d28-0
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:59.534
Thing, the front of it, but it
it's being held vertically by by

10442883-6598-48c9-b0f9-da9e3aac1d28-1
01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:01.770
a crane and it's.

e4e6b3ef-f291-4038-9066-128d8ed29907-0
01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:08.359
Looks partially like a machine,
but partially like a a creature

e4e6b3ef-f291-4038-9066-128d8ed29907-1
01:01:08.359 --> 01:01:13.429
because it's got this curly tail
and it's being hoisted out of

e4e6b3ef-f291-4038-9066-128d8ed29907-2
01:01:13.429 --> 01:01:18.418
the water anyway by this, by
this crane. There are two people

e4e6b3ef-f291-4038-9066-128d8ed29907-3
01:01:18.418 --> 01:01:22.200
standing on the balcony of this
of this crane.

4050e41b-2d55-4cfe-874f-f15d5689fef1-0
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:28.800
Conferring. One has a has some
kind of check check board,

f29d0139-9877-4e51-a1eb-d1de0dac81ba-0
01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.540
Some kind of clipboard.

39d8d411-8054-4e6d-a3d2-9ca74859eeab-0
01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.900
We see a huge wall above them.

fb0d188d-f330-425f-a76f-aa475da27de1-0
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:45.700
On the left hand side we see a.

18cdf92f-df50-4d73-842e-6e36bc959aa5-0
01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:53.032
a cityscape in the background
with a with a boat in the in the

18cdf92f-df50-4d73-842e-6e36bc959aa5-1
01:01:53.032 --> 01:01:54.800
foreground that has. 

9c344720-6e60-4e99-bce0-fbbfd11bd6ec-0
01:01:55.690 --> 01:02:00.688
Uh, in a net captured some some
kind of creature it's it's. I

9c344720-6e60-4e99-bce0-fbbfd11bd6ec-1
01:02:00.688 --> 01:02:04.880
think it's the one of those ones
with that has the.

5355b524-2e2b-4452-9949-fc028c66b3e4-0
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.139
Water pouring out of the above
but also and the that's more

5355b524-2e2b-4452-9949-fc028c66b3e4-1
01:02:12.139 --> 01:02:17.558
like a nose and you see two
glowing spots which which could

5355b524-2e2b-4452-9949-fc028c66b3e4-2
01:02:17.558 --> 01:02:23.067
well be eyes. The the little
boat, little paper boat is next

5355b524-2e2b-4452-9949-fc028c66b3e4-3
01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:23.790
to this.

5f0152e7-7f94-449d-9d68-c27b358c2e04-0
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:30.120
Boat, there's a there's a sailor
hanging over the side and.

1cfce8a4-bdcd-494b-9994-0460f93e2b2e-0
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.478
And a dog or something that's
like a dog also hanging over the

1cfce8a4-bdcd-494b-9994-0460f93e2b2e-1
01:02:37.478 --> 01:02:42.689
side. The boat has a has a
certain serpent design on its

1cfce8a4-bdcd-494b-9994-0460f93e2b2e-2
01:02:42.689 --> 01:02:45.980
side and a flag with a with a
fish.

f3404ad1-91d0-4d58-bc49-d3ec36f96c38-0
01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.610
On the right hand side we have.

8f48691b-affb-4ef7-95df-ff7bad9f472b-0
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.210

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.480
It's like a harbour scene. There
is a.

2baf2556-3b6a-4eb3-a666-fec18aae084e-0
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.502
It's hard to say whether it's a
boat or whether it's a it's a

2baf2556-3b6a-4eb3-a666-fec18aae084e-1
01:03:04.502 --> 01:03:06.010
house. I think it's a boat.

26ae5da4-49a6-4b2e-a42c-8921078c9512-0
01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:13.590

up. The the word is Exploratio.

f00fe54b-70a8-41d0-9f43-309ac1b0e077-0
01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:20.059
Which is like the name of the
boat, but up above it's it's

f00fe54b-70a8-41d0-9f43-309ac1b0e077-1

01:03:23.952 --> 01:03:26.070
windows and roofs like a house.

8b0df92a-4d2c-4927-88d2-562b5f3e43c7-0
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.810

on the left.

set of stairs leading down to
the water, and a man is on those

A river, I guess it's a river
with the little paper boat on on

31cd955e-35b8-4e4b-9988-43d1f00b2db0-1

01:18:45.296 --> 01:18:49.843
girl on a skateboard. It's a

01:19:06.586 --> 01:19:12.195

01:19:46.298 --> 01:19:51.236
The girl brings the red scooter
inside and the mother's,

82102238-c522-48a2-910f-d9d2789294de-2
01:19:51.236 --> 01:19:56.435
ignoring the girl. The father's
working on his computer and

82102238-c522-48a2-910f-d9d2789294de-3
01:19:56.435 --> 01:20:02.153
ignoring the girl. She's got the
kite, a red kite next to her and

82102238-c522-48a2-910f-d9d2789294de-4
01:20:02.153 --> 01:20:02.500

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:08.853
Uh, the girl is also trying to
attract the attention of what is

29edac4f-4f13-4fbd-844a-345b828e01eb-1
01:20:08.853 --> 01:20:13.927
maybe her older sister, looks
bigger, but she's on the couch

29edac4f-4f13-4fbd-844a-345b828e01eb-2
01:20:13.927 --> 01:20:19.002
reading a book, and it's also
ignoring her. So the girl goes

29edac4f-4f13-4fbd-844a-345b828e01eb-3
01:20:19.002 --> 01:20:23.910
to her room, where there's a the
cat. She sits on the bed.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.360
And is bored.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:39.487
The so now we see the the girl
getting up from the bed. The cat

dbd0340c-9089-49af-be05-a0f02035cde3-1
01:20:39.487 --> 01:20:44.028
is leaving the room. Then she
spies the the Red pencil on the

dbd0340c-9089-49af-be05-a0f02035cde3-2
01:20:44.028 --> 01:20:48.569
floor. There are also pieces of
paper on the on the floor. So

dbd0340c-9089-49af-be05-a0f02035cde3-3
01:20:48.569 --> 01:20:53.403
she picks up the red pencil. She
draws a door in the wall and she

dbd0340c-9089-49af-be05-a0f02035cde3-4
01:20:53.403 --> 01:20:57.577
goes through the through the
door leaving the pencil and

dbd0340c-9089-49af-be05-a0f02035cde3-5
01:20:57.577 --> 01:20:58.529
paper behind.

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:07.025
And there she is in this other
world, the door is a is a door

d5e76a09-fd72-4cef-9415-61ef3b218211-1
01:21:07.025 --> 01:21:12.604
out of the base of a tree. And
there are, there are, there are.

d5e76a09-fd72-4cef-9415-61ef3b218211-2
01:21:12.604 --> 01:21:18.009
There is a forest with a stream
running through it. There are

d5e76a09-fd72-4cef-9415-61ef3b218211-3
01:21:18.009 --> 01:21:23.327
lanterns, blue lanterns with
lights and and and green lights

d5e76a09-fd72-4cef-9415-61ef3b218211-4
01:21:23.327 --> 01:21:26.030
strung from the from the trees.

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:36.950
So she stands on a little dock
in the in the stream that is

fa43df51-2886-4802-a681-d9ef60ceba1f-1
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:40.450
running through this forest and
a.

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.900
There's something in the water
with a with a

66902cfd-5ed6-4847-9c5f-b2f1c7107df4-0
01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.920
It's like a red propeller.

c7a0e2fe-3b26-47fa-8701-d5c7936d3d24-0
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:56.708
Maybe moving towards them, maybe
moving away, probably moving

c7a0e2fe-3b26-47fa-8701-d5c7936d3d24-1
01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.380
away because of propellers.

5d943244-1ba3-4338-8aec-9b63005862f4-0
01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.390
Towards the girl. But anyway she
lies down in the dock and she

5d943244-1ba3-4338-8aec-9b63005862f4-1
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:08.464
draws herself a boat with the
Magic Pencil and gets in the

5d943244-1ba3-4338-8aec-9b63005862f4-2
01:22:08.464 --> 01:22:08.810
boat.

6fa54771-5fbf-4449-8d6f-8b0929b92709-0
01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:17.660
And she's on this waterway.

ce44afdf-32d3-4d45-9b96-b4762e4aa2cc-0
01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:28.726
Which is going towards big the
Big city which are which they

ce44afdf-32d3-4d45-9b96-b4762e4aa2cc-1
01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:34.290
visited before in previous
stories.

bae132a2-e0b3-46f6-9afa-fd3110c958fe-0
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:41.881
And, uh, she, she's she's going
to go over this aqueduct into

bae132a2-e0b3-46f6-9afa-fd3110c958fe-1
01:22:41.881 --> 01:22:43.560

bc99a645-7f2e-42b9-b928-257fb6e5c022-0
01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:48.630
And now

eac79e3c-d6b9-4cfa-92bc-106d2ccfd8e1-0
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:50.020
She's.

72445c8d-c4b1-46b0-8e73-a263f7c9bc6d-0
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:59.863
On an aqueduct and it's there's
a series of of of locks that

72445c8d-c4b1-46b0-8e73-a263f7c9bc6d-1
01:22:59.863 --> 01:23:07.540
allow the the the boats to move
around and change levels.

d9656d19-a5f0-4262-b77b-faf76ffef814-0
01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.460
And there are there are soldiers
who.

1e34123c-ad09-4520-a995-ffc79fd6260a-0
01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.528
Who seems to be greeting her
enthusiastically. One is

1e34123c-ad09-4520-a995-ffc79fd6260a-1
01:23:17.528 --> 01:23:18.110
saluting.

469e58ad-c661-4e66-8735-ab80da5bd4ff-0
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:21.620
And um.

ae979384-3ccc-4208-baa7-54f3f4bb995f-0
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:24.390
Other.

d89f032d-1fdf-4528-9073-3fc02929d5c0-0
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:30.077
other boats are moving around
this system of waterways through

d89f032d-1fdf-4528-9073-3fc02929d5c0-1
01:23:30.077 --> 01:23:31.490
the through the city.

398827ca-2ab3-4537-9cea-65b1975e7ae7-0
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:35.810
OK.

ba05871c-803f-42d1-8060-a206b34085f2-0
01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:41.694
Now she gets to the end of one
of these waterways and it's

ba05871c-803f-42d1-8060-a206b34085f2-1
01:23:41.694 --> 01:23:43.660
actually a a big waterfall.

2ecb0876-3d4e-4b35-88f7-d1bffc6871ab-0
01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:51.844
And her boat is about to go off
the edge of of this of this

2ecb0876-3d4e-4b35-88f7-d1bffc6871ab-1
01:23:51.844 --> 01:23:52.690
waterfall.

045a3dc7-f2bb-418f-bf04-884a1eaaad89-0
01:23:55.710 --> 01:24:03.070
And the boat is is is falling
and she's falling, but she's she

045a3dc7-f2bb-418f-bf04-884a1eaaad89-1
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:04.940
manages to draw.

2b6e1959-d2bd-49bd-9d11-59cfd614f482-0
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:11.203
a circle with this with her
Magic Pen, which is probably

2b6e1959-d2bd-49bd-9d11-59cfd614f482-1
01:24:11.203 --> 01:24:16.141
gonna save her from whatever
fall she is in. Sure enough,

2b6e1959-d2bd-49bd-9d11-59cfd614f482-2
01:24:16.141 --> 01:24:18.100
it's so it's a balloon.

32701769-d6c4-48bc-9e96-dce0da86e2cc-0
01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.310
And she floats away.

4a8e758d-fd14-401c-968a-10f70823ec6e-0
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:26.280
From the disaster.

45a59c4d-2f86-4d08-be2b-951e25a89074-0
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.060
And um.

dd6eca08-bf2b-43b1-8809-7c6a23cf54d2-0
01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.390
In the next page we see a flying
machine.

63b902bc-e3b0-42f0-b1e5-a48e1ce4bab8-0
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:41.230
In the sky it looks like a a
paddle wheel.

f31df5d1-8fda-4a30-8d13-cc904878aa8d-0
01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:48.252
boat with the rear section of a
of a of a planes propeller. It's

f31df5d1-8fda-4a30-8d13-cc904878aa8d-1
01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:54.181
it's going through the sky and
and there are also these smaller

f31df5d1-8fda-4a30-8d13-cc904878aa8d-2
01:24:54.181 --> 01:24:59.370
crafts which are like balloons
with with with boat like

f31df5d1-8fda-4a30-8d13-cc904878aa8d-3
01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:05.207
platforms below them. And we see
our old friend the the purple

f31df5d1-8fda-4a30-8d13-cc904878aa8d-4
01:25:05.207 --> 01:25:10.395
bird flying through the sky
beneath these, these uh the

f31df5d1-8fda-4a30-8d13-cc904878aa8d-5
01:25:10.395 --> 01:25:11.600
aerial craft.

ffe4e840-1e4e-461c-9d61-f63e30a68ff9-0
01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.500
And the the girl is.

46ab65b3-9508-4ef7-bd37-cf3253459a84-0
01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.570
In the in the basket of the
balloon.

dff3b0d6-698d-4eaf-9d34-8bf4a5c2fca9-0
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:27.200
She may be following one of
these.

1271934c-9ace-4e76-a0ba-11296076639c-0
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:33.361
No, no it's coming towards it
because the propellers are back

1271934c-9ace-4e76-a0ba-11296076639c-1
01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:36.490
so she's she's meeting one of
these these.

e335a021-0c2f-4314-8eea-3772c4bdbb99-0
01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:39.960
Crafts and.

81034b96-fb7f-4d4f-a1a8-cbec607120be-0
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:46.701
In one of them there is a, I
guess they're soldiers and one

81034b96-fb7f-4d4f-a1a8-cbec607120be-1
01:25:46.701 --> 01:25:51.200
is trying to catch the the
purple bird with a net.

5e88a983-3c1a-4225-86e9-73d2c5616269-0
01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:02.309
And in fact, they've succeeded
in catching the purple bird.

5e88a983-3c1a-4225-86e9-73d2c5616269-1
01:26:02.309 --> 01:26:06.089
It's in the, in their cage, and
it's being loaded onto this

5e88a983-3c1a-4225-86e9-73d2c5616269-2
01:26:06.089 --> 01:26:06.530
larger.

2a9b48ab-498c-4c23-ba19-d8e90f4b9dad-0
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:13.433
Flying Machine which is which is
like a combination paddle

2a9b48ab-498c-4c23-ba19-d8e90f4b9dad-1
01:26:13.433 --> 01:26:16.110
Wheeler and plane and and ship.

21fd82bd-8ec0-4c7b-a03c-b2fd09eb7b79-0
01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:22.040
And the girl is approaching
this.

ea4db955-3d8f-4ccb-ab71-3454f7c93b89-0
01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:27.400
This flying contraption in her
in her balloon.

04059bb1-51fd-4364-b83f-6e79a6be2452-0
01:26:30.610 --> 01:26:40.330
And she gets she, she she lands
on this, this machine and.

6a5bfa80-8ad9-471b-8d0f-feee9a4e05a3-0
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:47.610
She's running towards a doorway
and and.

9eb31788-5cec-4068-8a0a-e7408e0f2dc7-0
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:53.564
In this machine, and on a
different level up above, we see

9eb31788-5cec-4068-8a0a-e7408e0f2dc7-1
01:26:53.564 --> 01:26:54.590
the soldiers.

1a67970b-b4e6-4094-b292-0b9d9f553dc3-0
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:59.737
Carrying the cage containing the
purple bird, and they're moving

1a67970b-b4e6-4094-b292-0b9d9f553dc3-1
01:26:59.737 --> 01:27:02.810
into a different part of the of
the machine.

8a7a5496-b016-4fa5-b224-b3a937703b41-0
01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:10.505
And the the the cage in the next
picture is placed on this

8a7a5496-b016-4fa5-b224-b3a937703b41-1
01:27:10.505 --> 01:27:12.270
pedestal in this.

758c5d19-c6d3-44ba-90d0-e05cd0d855ba-0
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:22.305
Pagoda like structure which is
on top, it's part of the this

758c5d19-c6d3-44ba-90d0-e05cd0d855ba-1
01:27:22.305 --> 01:27:28.375
this flying machine and we see
the the girl climbing up towards

758c5d19-c6d3-44ba-90d0-e05cd0d855ba-2
01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:33.876
this pagoda which where the bird
is guarded by two of the

758c5d19-c6d3-44ba-90d0-e05cd0d855ba-3
01:27:33.876 --> 01:27:34.730
soldiers.

01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:47.368
The soldiers are startled by the
the girl, who grabs the cage

c14773c0-8a42-4c7a-ba1c-9f0440011ce9-1
01:27:47.368 --> 01:27:51.960
with the purple bird in it and
and runs away.

e60d34ee-1efb-4ef7-ad51-61be9e67641c-0
01:27:53.440 --> 01:28:00.261
She goes out onto the very prow
of this ship, opens the cage and

e60d34ee-1efb-4ef7-ad51-61be9e67641c-1
01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:03.410
lets the purple bird fly away.

01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:14.300
some of the insides of this this
flying machine. It's very

632d0ae8-6f3b-4068-9c3d-9ae3f1d38b25-2
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.230
complicated.

9f97ea10-aea8-4702-a962-ab9775fe9055-0
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.400
Pipes and wheels and stuff.

f599adf7-8d15-4c4e-b240-a2261c72b0be-0
01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.860

01:28:30.570 --> 01:28:31.660
Red pencil.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:37.410
Flies out of her hands and off
the edge of this this platform.

5572b1df-1e69-404d-aed9-15f085cfe0ab-1
01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:41.586
Or or maybe actually they they
one of the soldiers, the the guy

5572b1df-1e69-404d-aed9-15f085cfe0ab-2
01:28:41.586 --> 01:28:45.697
who looks like the head soldier
that actually picked it up and

5572b1df-1e69-404d-aed9-15f085cfe0ab-3
01:28:45.697 --> 01:28:49.742
dropped it over the side because
you see his arm outstretched

5572b1df-1e69-404d-aed9-15f085cfe0ab-4
01:28:49.742 --> 01:28:50.330
above it.

256f5942-cafd-41a6-b023-70527568d289-0

The soldiers then put the girl
in a.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:01.990
Larger.

78792b40-1175-4c9c-b0d1-7c60ffe6f5dd-0
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:07.826
It's almost like a cage, but
it's it's it's a kind of a

78792b40-1175-4c9c-b0d1-7c60ffe6f5dd-1
01:29:07.826 --> 01:29:12.275
pagoda. Well, it's it's some
kind of structure that is is

78792b40-1175-4c9c-b0d1-7c60ffe6f5dd-2
01:29:12.275 --> 01:29:13.810

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:24.840
It's a platform with with with
sides.

ebe940ef-068d-4445-8329-02dfa9a4d09d-0
01:29:28.690 --> 01:29:33.676
And there there there are

01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:41.200
But.

f6cf7cd6-0dbd-49e6-9c64-f9ab0112bc36-0
01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:48.838

Contraption.

f5309528-8dda-4e7a-902c-6dd7d701dff0-0
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:59.790
cage like contraption and.

457bb684-1de3-4a29-b5e1-5296d01e29d3-0
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.050
That gives it to the girl.

b4fd025a-4220-4b68-95aa-d54599b2f69c-0
01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.650
Uh, who starts to

b1d7c945-048e-4eac-b826-f89a9031ce58-0
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:09.860
Draw Something. The bird watches
very excitedly.

a5dcaca9-3ce2-4a54-bf0c-1951987febc7-0
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:18.175
And the girl, in fact, has drawn
a magic carpet which allows her

a5dcaca9-3ce2-4a54-bf0c-1951987febc7-1
01:30:18.175 --> 01:30:18.790
to leave.

67b5ef85-20d7-49f5-a98d-27b9af12d018-0
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:19.970
The

02de01d8-a03e-4980-b8e9-7e5938522f9c-0
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:29.510
The most effectively was a cage
and fly over.

9c6f9d88-574a-4b96-a359-306c13f36703-0
01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.830
The city with the bird leading
the way.

978b6ece-b515-4346-a260-eb91aa60a035-0
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:43.240
And we see the girl flying
through.

187cec5c-fb48-4b8e-9c80-c4969a076ec1-0
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:44.890
The.

4f94ca5b-7889-4671-8f26-2811387c3ba3-0
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:51.863
The Sunset, sunsetting sky, lots
of stars. The the birds are

4f94ca5b-7889-4671-8f26-2811387c3ba3-1
01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:55.560
leading the way out over the
water.

09ecd3d4-f337-4ab6-b8db-20ca4ad50870-0
01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.677
So maybe it's not a water
because there's a tree growing,

09ecd3d4-f337-4ab6-b8db-20ca4ad50870-1
01:31:01.677 --> 01:31:06.366
but anyway. But the girl is
escaping from the city with with

09ecd3d4-f337-4ab6-b8db-20ca4ad50870-2
01:31:06.366 --> 01:31:07.980
the bird in the lead.

838c6e23-7f36-4b12-83c7-29acdfe5891c-0
01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.530
And she gets.

f2656a0f-de57-4d1a-8633-709ccbdef8f2-0
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:15.260
To.

3abea419-4eeb-4947-95d0-287d66505f39-0
01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:19.760
A tree. The the the bird.

762dc804-3e6c-4af1-906a-224a343820a9-0
01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:25.536
Leads to a tree, and there's a
purple door in the base of this

762dc804-3e6c-4af1-906a-224a343820a9-1
01:31:25.536 --> 01:31:26.330
palm tree.

e0ce0b4c-18e2-4050-9b20-d643efc61415-0
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.560
She opens the door.

c7eb97d2-1096-4324-a648-a79848500428-0
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:34.780
The boat flies through and she
follows.

335140f4-8167-49be-81cf-c19a1424c151-0
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.740
And she actually comes out.

c5f788a8-ee12-417b-92db-6452fe912cfe-0
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:45.836
in uh through a mailbox in the
the street where she started

c5f788a8-ee12-417b-92db-6452fe912cfe-1
01:31:45.836 --> 01:31:51.230
from. The purple bird's flying,
and the the the boy with the

c5f788a8-ee12-417b-92db-6452fe912cfe-2
01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:54.680
striped shirt is running towards
them.

229c4bdf-9b20-4a23-8c04-c82b8c862daf-0
01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.250
And he has a magic pencil.

b88d480b-c4a1-4777-9b5a-64ca5c2c9923-0
01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:01.540
a Purple one.

dcf62e61-eaa9-4518-b474-9ba06eba4c93-0
01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:05.420
The.

e80057bf-b78a-469f-98bc-7be7935ac094-0
01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:14.368
The boy greets the the girl. The
the purple bird lands on his on

e80057bf-b78a-469f-98bc-7be7935ac094-1
01:32:14.368 --> 01:32:20.897
his hand, maybe using his magic
pencil as a as a perch. The girl

e80057bf-b78a-469f-98bc-7be7935ac094-2
01:32:20.897 --> 01:32:27.125
uses her magic pencil to draw a
circle and and the boy draws,

e80057bf-b78a-469f-98bc-7be7935ac094-3
01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:32.650
uses his to draw a circle. Hers
is red, his is purple.

0d1c6a04-564f-446f-a351-e4821aba51df-0
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:38.000
And um, they together make a.

8cefa5a5-444a-4cac-9f89-a3016f5af30b-0
01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.497
A bicycle. Those two circles
with the wheels of the bicycle

8cefa5a5-444a-4cac-9f89-a3016f5af30b-1
01:32:43.497 --> 01:32:44.890
is a tandem bicycle.

f1d177af-250f-4fa5-9a70-4488446d5746-0
01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:47.580
And they set off.

7176abbb-8e0c-4ca8-a510-641a604f2e59-0
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:49.530
Somewhere.

af5dee88-93b2-4776-ad0e-16b53f38667e-0
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:54.123
Along the along the street with
the purple bird accompanying

af5dee88-93b2-4776-ad0e-16b53f38667e-1
01:32:54.123 --> 01:32:55.060
them. #END_journey

0c347ec6-d2ad-4b4f-97ba-e4e19da35623-0
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:57.990
That was the story.

20c85ed5-e6e0-4f28-9b5f-0518d3658e99-0
01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:02.020
And then going ahead, another
complex scene.

3b71cc94-41c6-4ab8-9609-aa32c4af16ee-0
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:06.100
#START_being_a_pirate OK, this
is being a pirate.

46feab60-8a91-4f41-a6f5-8861e1b20058-0
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:18.110
So we see a a water scene. There
is a a large sailing ship.

aa6306ae-ca7d-4880-a08a-7a589c321843-0
01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:19.850
Um.

7c041174-7585-4ee5-858d-d9b1a0276f0c-0
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:27.353
The the, the masts are are
furled but there are there are

7c041174-7585-4ee5-858d-d9b1a0276f0c-1
01:33:27.353 --> 01:33:33.459
people that have climbed up the
mast and are standing on the on

7c041174-7585-4ee5-858d-d9b1a0276f0c-2
01:33:33.459 --> 01:33:38.230
the spires that go out from the
side of the mast.

9a76e6ca-6ad0-435b-9d7b-5d8da85ca380-0
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:42.390
Some of them are pirates.

c223c0dc-c80a-43a3-89c2-a6018f15bce0-0
01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:44.980
Umm.

89d34cb9-ecfe-41cf-a890-b970001278cf-0
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:54.030
That there are smaller boats.

600e59fc-ffee-4dde-876c-505b790192a0-0
01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:03.205
I think they they the bigger
boat is being attacked by

600e59fc-ffee-4dde-876c-505b790192a0-1
01:34:03.205 --> 01:34:08.983
pirates. One of the smaller
boats has a A Jolly Roger flag

600e59fc-ffee-4dde-876c-505b790192a0-2
01:34:08.983 --> 01:34:15.153
on its uh stern. Another of the
boats is is firing a cannon at

600e59fc-ffee-4dde-876c-505b790192a0-3
01:34:15.153 --> 01:34:21.518
the the the large boats were and
it hits the the top of the mast

600e59fc-ffee-4dde-876c-505b790192a0-4
01:34:21.518 --> 01:34:21.909
and.

c2156907-ca7b-45a6-8c32-0f97f2419761-0
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.166
People, sailors are getting
knocked off the mast. There are

c2156907-ca7b-45a6-8c32-0f97f2419761-1
01:34:28.166 --> 01:34:32.893
a lot of people on the on the
deck of the the boat, some of

c2156907-ca7b-45a6-8c32-0f97f2419761-2
01:34:32.893 --> 01:34:37.777
whom are are are pirates and
some of them are are sailors and

c2156907-ca7b-45a6-8c32-0f97f2419761-3
01:34:37.777 --> 01:34:38.249
their.

414985b7-e93d-48f7-ad09-e865594dcede-0
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.790
They're fighting. I I I believe
there are. There's a another.

9112c9a6-124d-498d-88a5-f02f4f091b84-0
01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.190
Large boat on the left, you just
see the stern.

77ae6cfe-de3c-4eac-9db4-48c63e0bbf85-0
01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.070
But.

e73d11a9-f4ad-406d-a3b1-883506a7b16e-0
01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:59.470
It it has a Jolly Roger flag
and.

9da817a6-f950-428c-a405-a7fd18c66a8c-0
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:05.210
It looks like that's where the
small boats are are.

986253e5-b4dd-4b0d-80b4-298157e4cf82-0
01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:13.354
Embarking from and the, the
Pirates from there are attacking

986253e5-b4dd-4b0d-80b4-298157e4cf82-1
01:35:13.354 --> 01:35:17.300
the the largest ship in the
middle.

dddd6fb4-4240-4ba2-b4a0-ad9fcc8572d1-0
01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:23.190
There is a third sailing ship.

1229e315-c37b-475c-8a7d-4abc106afe30-0
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:31.410
Which has three Jolly Roger flag
flags on it.

cb652142-af14-42a5-a924-6fe164e8f1ce-0
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:33.270
And.

01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:38.320
It is being attacked itself by.

d6a2ec0a-0bd7-4a40-a5c0-c18e523581c4-0
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.120
I believe it's sailors.

5554acb3-f36e-4bc7-a848-42df351f11fe-0
01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:50.779
One of the sailors has been
captured and is being made to

5554acb3-f36e-4bc7-a848-42df351f11fe-1
01:35:50.779 --> 01:35:55.765
walk the plank at the rear of
this other ship. There there are

5554acb3-f36e-4bc7-a848-42df351f11fe-2
01:35:55.765 --> 01:35:56.240
other.

0c2d44c0-0777-48bb-8f68-d9ab591b6838-0
01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:02.620
Pirates on the.

On the mast of of this ship,

68dded39-031e-49ca-9f13-0d022d8b9119-1

Drinking rum, presumably.

c462254b-d234-4c46-8ef4-341a1d67c784-0
01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.890

01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:49.793
#START_wild_west Well, we we
have actually two scenes here

8fa097d0-e731-4183-a17b-be7cdd8b2a9b-1
01:37:49.793 --> 01:37:51.260
called the Wild, Wild West.

d46dfd67-c1aa-4808-906e-823aaeedf4c0-0
01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.180
And on the left hand side.

e070b25a-2745-4623-a103-0a6b45ae2ed4-0
01:37:58.850 --> 01:38:04.714
We see a street scene. There's
there's a hotel. There's a

e070b25a-2745-4623-a103-0a6b45ae2ed4-1
01:38:04.714 --> 01:38:11.084
general store, there's a saloon,

e070b25a-2745-4623-a103-0a6b45ae2ed4-2
01:38:11.084 --> 01:38:17.151
such. There's there's more than
one saloon, there's several

e070b25a-2745-4623-a103-0a6b45ae2ed4-3
01:38:17.151 --> 01:38:17.960
saloons.

7d8f341c-cfc2-4dea-bdbf-d37de9d10f0b-0
01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:24.090
Uh, and there's another hotel.

830eb6d6-2216-45f9-93b7-2a6315563f0e-0
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.710

01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:29.280
Covered wagons.

58928300-d286-49d3-acd5-e9239ab60d85-0
01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.480
which seem to be Patched up in
various.

01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:35.620
Ways. We see.

69b4b12b-efa9-42cf-bdcd-58a889aa1102-0
01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:41.210
We see a herd.

69ff0903-3472-4324-bfda-69c6ef6eb8cd-0
01:38:42.170 --> 01:38:47.536
Of Buffalo. But the Buffalo
aren't real Buffalo. They're

69ff0903-3472-4324-bfda-69c6ef6eb8cd-1
01:38:47.536 --> 01:38:52.997
actually cards of some some
kind. Very strange. There's a

69ff0903-3472-4324-bfda-69c6ef6eb8cd-2
01:38:52.997 --> 01:38:58.740
there's a horse tied up at the
hitching post in front of the

69ff0903-3472-4324-bfda-69c6ef6eb8cd-3
01:38:58.740 --> 01:38:59.399
saloon.

dcbe654f-26ea-47e7-ac9d-231dd35e8dd5-0

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.390
are um

b2b613a5-3040-4d6e-a9a9-bbfecedd30be-0
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.914
Looks like on top of the hotel
somebody is holding up a group

b2b613a5-3040-4d6e-a9a9-bbfecedd30be-1
01:39:11.914 --> 01:39:14.270
of people pointing a gun at
them.

Left we see mines, which to
maybe gold digging mines.

d0c843cf-58c5-4a58-8ac9-3d978387e7b7-0
01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:34.042
On the jail, I guess it's the
Sheriff's Office too. We see

d0c843cf-58c5-4a58-8ac9-3d978387e7b7-1
01:39:34.042 --> 01:39:36.640
wanted pictures on the side.

ed58fc4e-d10e-4d5a-afab-14b036602356-0
01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:38.220

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.620
We, we, we we also see that.

3a575737-459c-45cf-ba77-1d9b414053f8-0
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.960
Some of the the the the building
on the on the bottom left is a

3a575737-459c-45cf-ba77-1d9b414053f8-1
01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.972
is just a facade. It's not a
real building with any depth,

3a575737-459c-45cf-ba77-1d9b414053f8-2
01:40:01.972 --> 01:40:04.010
although it has a a.

4a66e6be-d459-4d43-984c-6be447810ae6-0
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:08.905
A balcony, but there's nothing
behind it. There's no

4a66e6be-d459-4d43-984c-6be447810ae6-1
01:40:08.905 --> 01:40:09.710
substantial.

31446e31-ab17-486f-a18a-cf0b42d1a817-0
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:12.500
Building behind it.

02e15dea-1d9e-455e-8800-9abc1154072e-0
01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.900
There are people walking in the
in the street. There's a horse.

4ebf7bee-1f77-477f-b269-2f4d576903c9-0
01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.270
Which is.

b326ea4a-586f-4c3a-92cb-b271020c1305-0
01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:29.740
Seems to be painting a picture
of a of a wagon to the surprise

b326ea4a-586f-4c3a-92cb-b271020c1305-1
01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:30.560
of people.

286c8bae-7c72-49e4-b1d6-1d9e28f0723a-0
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.530
Around them.

60712392-b5f9-42b1-a65b-c1b9dab449f3-0
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:36.560
Maybe I should move to the

a9070b04-7dc5-421a-b093-065ab7650aff-0
01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.030

Here we see, uh, there's a,

90b907a3-f4d9-4d58-a636-db5aef390f2c-0
01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:51.650
A train.

deb51890-4d21-4354-b5e5-7563e721fb8d-0
01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:55.150
With train tracks.

5f443e56-b0cb-4870-9531-8d3f8ae9a2c7-0
01:40:56.510 --> 01:41:01.363
Uh, and there's a Stagecoach
which looks like it's maybe

5f443e56-b0cb-4870-9531-8d3f8ae9a2c7-1
01:41:01.363 --> 01:41:06.387
stuck on the on the train
tracks, and there are men trying

5f443e56-b0cb-4870-9531-8d3f8ae9a2c7-2
01:41:06.387 --> 01:41:10.390
to lift it up and get it off
there. There's a.

d71879d2-55e0-44e0-98f8-8324dbf14567-0
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:15.760
The.

01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:26.676
There again there are several
saloons with with with

3d0e2199-9844-4c89-afc3-12317232d5c2-1
01:41:26.676 --> 01:41:27.580
balconies.

2addfef5-cf0f-4f5d-9c9b-041988963d9c-0
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.401
It's mixed up with a with a
bank. It all these things, or

2addfef5-cf0f-4f5d-9c9b-041988963d9c-1
01:41:34.401 --> 01:41:40.410
several of them, seem to be just
facades and and there are people

2addfef5-cf0f-4f5d-9c9b-041988963d9c-2
01:41:40.410 --> 01:41:41.230
painting.

2bf45e23-b073-432a-be4f-595451a4ff82-0
01:41:42.230 --> 01:41:43.920
Things and.

d7394a59-c08b-48b8-96c7-79fc5960e4cc-0
01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:53.405
Trying to make things ready,
maybe for a for a movie set. Up

d7394a59-c08b-48b8-96c7-79fc5960e4cc-1
01:41:53.405 --> 01:41:56.570
at the top, there's a man.

1490a4fb-d65b-4185-89ad-e1f1f6175b1c-0
01:41:58.370 --> 01:42:02.170
On a horse riding off into the
sunset, but in fact.

d975f3cc-5a6f-4795-97a9-b4678dc1d1f8-0
01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:08.247
It turns out that he's he's just
bumping into a picture of a of a

d975f3cc-5a6f-4795-97a9-b4678dc1d1f8-1
01:42:08.247 --> 01:42:09.200
of a sunset.

ebf39d37-dff3-4059-9964-9d7d6c95e59b-0
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:12.430
And and you see the.

e63b6074-7cca-43e8-a646-abe39df12218-0
01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.910
The movie camera and the movie
crew trying to.

be70f1d6-a9b5-44dd-938c-ae4769c34045-0
01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:24.540
Trying to film this scene,
people are are waving goodbye to

be70f1d6-a9b5-44dd-938c-ae4769c34045-1
01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.913
this man who was trying to ride
off into the into the scenery

be70f1d6-a9b5-44dd-938c-ae4769c34045-2
01:42:29.913 --> 01:42:31.820
sunset. #END_wild_west

d2dc11af-44d0-4b88-8cf3-cc9556733cf2-0
01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:38.587
OK, so that was about 5 minutes.
Yeah, last. This one is also

d2dc11af-44d0-4b88-8cf3-cc9556733cf2-1
01:42:38.587 --> 01:42:40.820
part of a graphic novel.

0c859067-7afd-436b-b6e8-3ff5b1b0f84c-0
01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:42.920
Because.

0ab4abe1-ece1-44c2-af61-1f4364234d13-0

OK.

4ca9ec67-c92d-47d5-a85b-ab6798920db9-0
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:48.610
#START_arrival_6 So this is the.

01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:57.103
The one with the with the sepia
tones and strange creatures. We

33849611-1d5b-4935-a972-4438bc65fd41-1
01:42:57.103 --> 01:42:58.350
see a a pot

f0ee2a92-d627-4ef4-8aaa-afc8c9f146cc-0
01:42:59.170 --> 01:42:59.700
Uh.

971a2f75-e6ea-4c6c-abb8-1cdb9a015d5c-0
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:06.480
with a light behind the pot. A
flying creature.

770d0492-b280-4d14-9971-08a791448f6c-0
01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:10.960
Approaches the pot and lands on
the edge of the pot.

cc7c8473-b806-400f-8eb3-3c526d789b89-0
01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:12.160
Umm.

6208ad76-9905-4fb7-9968-ea117e7d0314-0
01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.880
We we we now see a, A, a
broader, the camera pulls back a

6208ad76-9905-4fb7-9968-ea117e7d0314-1
01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.050
little and and we see.

e9a122e6-c734-46ef-a03b-1df57e63c8a3-0
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:26.050
A mirror with a man.

be89ee5d-af20-439c-af42-2a2134e9ea71-0
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.310
writing.

7bdc6489-0f0d-466f-8e64-a660e9358ef3-0
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:35.210
and he's dipping his pen in ink.
And there, there is a

f4c63755-cb74-409a-ab93-56477a62bf58-0
01:43:37.410 --> 01:43:42.560
A lamp, which is what made the
the light in the above picture.

f4c63755-cb74-409a-ab93-56477a62bf58-1
01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.792
We see a closer up of what he's
writing, although we can't read

f4c63755-cb74-409a-ab93-56477a62bf58-2
01:43:47.792 --> 01:43:52.780
it and there are some money next
to the next to the ink pot.

fa0e7beb-9438-46b4-a35e-7cb9bb3b20d4-0
01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:59.050
He's he's finished what he's
writing and he folds it up and

fa0e7beb-9438-46b4-a35e-7cb9bb3b20d4-1
01:43:59.050 --> 01:44:00.580
makes a an origami.

6ca38d9e-bb69-4487-9baa-cf0fa708373a-0
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:05.970
Bird, and he puts that.

0b99207e-5927-4534-bfab-d06c091fafed-0
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:12.770
In his it's it's an envelope. He
puts the bird in an envelope.

9d77f92f-7440-40d7-b325-1ac76a1baf55-0
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:17.455
I think it puts the money in in
the envelope too and seals the

9d77f92f-7440-40d7-b325-1ac76a1baf55-1
01:44:17.455 --> 01:44:19.590
envelope and put the stamp on
it.

c83cbdf4-2fdd-4deb-9ec5-057e8698fd07-0
01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:27.007
He's he's going down the stairs
now, away from his apartment,

c83cbdf4-2fdd-4deb-9ec5-057e8698fd07-1
01:44:27.007 --> 01:44:28.430
accompanied by.

aab42444-104b-4bda-bf83-ceea8e7494a3-0
01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:33.453
His, his like I called it the
mouse like creature in the last

aab42444-104b-4bda-bf83-ceea8e7494a3-1
01:44:33.453 --> 01:44:34.430
times so let's

79a41fe7-5953-4e6f-8b52-44e124cbb6ea-0
01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:39.835
Carry on. It might be more like
dog like but anyway mouse like

79a41fe7-5953-4e6f-8b52-44e124cbb6ea-1
01:44:39.835 --> 01:44:41.640
and he meets a an older.

32e5f418-650e-4905-9558-0c8d392a1c18-0
01:44:42.570 --> 01:44:48.241
Woman, and he's asking her maybe
where he can mail this letter,

32e5f418-650e-4905-9558-0c8d392a1c18-1
01:44:48.241 --> 01:44:50.280
and he approaches this.

c6c33eb7-dd2f-4a5e-b552-5ceeaaf1b48b-0
01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:59.540
Machine with with the bunch of
buttons on it and.

fecc2554-4253-4b8e-a98f-23c358d54d86-0
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:05.963
He reads the directions and
pulls a knob on this machine. A

fecc2554-4253-4b8e-a98f-23c358d54d86-1
01:45:05.963 --> 01:45:09.800
door opens and he puts the
letter in it.

49c748f9-d9c3-498e-837a-9ab11e884ef3-0
01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:13.300
And he's looking up and he sees.

9ba779db-324f-4ffc-89d1-3d3ec4e69025-0
01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:14.640


baa3e29a-036f-402d-97c6-963404a6129f-0
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:22.800
Some kind of balloon lift this
whole machine away, and away

baa3e29a-036f-402d-97c6-963404a6129f-1
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.290
goes and takes his letter with
it, and he walks away.

acb0e4f6-459c-4d49-b7ee-96f88920d2c5-0
01:45:29.050 --> 01:45:31.670
Through this forest of leaf like
trees.

c196dcf8-8959-4c00-930d-09ff344a39f3-0
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.034
We we focus in on one of these
leaf like trees. There is rain.

c196dcf8-8959-4c00-930d-09ff344a39f3-1
01:45:42.034 --> 01:45:45.390
The tree splits and out of it
grows.

0f2412a4-f7bb-4048-b536-de9e172d4138-0
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:53.612
A plant, so with a circular
flower. The flower gets big and

0f2412a4-f7bb-4048-b536-de9e172d4138-1
01:45:53.612 --> 01:45:54.360
bright.

4e5a6b87-6f4e-41a6-829a-e0435593e21a-0
01:45:56.730 --> 01:45:57.790
And then

8183880a-a32e-4703-9e7c-ca58b83e5c68-0
01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:05.980
It's it starts to fade, it dark
gets dark and it's it's it

8183880a-a32e-4703-9e7c-ca58b83e5c68-1
01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:12.185
decays away, but there's still
the framework of the of the leaf

8183880a-a32e-4703-9e7c-ca58b83e5c68-2
01:46:12.185 --> 01:46:12.670
left.

b16396c5-8f13-49b7-bd37-7e73ad91b7f7-0
01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:16.260
And maybe we and now we see.

2f817899-1d27-464d-8925-5f7d437a7391-0
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:19.650
A different evolution. Maybe
it's a.

4d3372d7-b170-452a-8f0b-6a3e21f91357-0
01:46:20.970 --> 01:46:28.762
A different tree, the the leaf
splits again. There's a, there's

4d3372d7-b170-452a-8f0b-6a3e21f91357-1
01:46:28.762 --> 01:46:36.432
a circular flower that comes up
and it's bright and then fades

4d3372d7-b170-452a-8f0b-6a3e21f91357-2
01:46:36.432 --> 01:46:36.920
and.

331c1c68-fe48-4441-8c91-dbc92e9c6530-0
01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:45.190
What's left is is just a
framework of the of the leaf and

331c1c68-fe48-4441-8c91-dbc92e9c6530-1
01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:47.230
it starts to snow.

c9eae2cf-1bc2-44a7-887c-2fb096ab2e28-0
01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:55.367
Uh, I think maybe I was reading
them the wrong sequence. It it

c9eae2cf-1bc2-44a7-887c-2fb096ab2e28-1
01:46:55.367 --> 01:47:00.246
went across the way, now it
never. Anyway, never mind.

c9eae2cf-1bc2-44a7-887c-2fb096ab2e28-2
01:47:00.246 --> 01:47:05.390
That's the basic thing. The
flower blooms and then decays

c9eae2cf-1bc2-44a7-887c-2fb096ab2e28-3
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:08.850
away. We we now see a different
scene.

444b3b2f-86ff-4399-a261-6f6a28597d4d-0
01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:16.160
A cityscape. Big building with
lots of windows. It's it's a

444b3b2f-86ff-4399-a261-6f6a28597d4d-1
01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.930
winter scene. It's snowing.
There are there are people.

8c3cd605-819d-4132-a749-f1e8ef3e4f20-0
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:27.231
Down on on the ground, small,
people are tiny compared to

8c3cd605-819d-4132-a749-f1e8ef3e4f20-1
01:47:27.231 --> 01:47:28.540
these buildings.

4dc94702-5d3e-43fc-abf4-66aa201df61c-0
01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.500
Unusual. Some, some unusual.

7807633b-9b35-45ef-b117-3b8f81a976a8-0
01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:40.900
Shapes of pyramids and fin like
things that there are this.

681383fc-5883-4ca7-86f8-c67e1fb091d4-0
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:47.977
Almost looks like a A flying
machine close to the ground,

681383fc-5883-4ca7-86f8-c67e1fb091d4-1
01:47:47.977 --> 01:47:50.270
boat like flying machine.

10a22aac-d95d-46d1-a2fd-c601c4bb4366-0
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:55.586
And then in the right hand
picture, we we're, we're down

10a22aac-d95d-46d1-a2fd-c601c4bb4366-1
01:47:55.586 --> 01:47:57.640
closer to the ground and we get.

e861226d-2b2f-4f44-aad0-dcf0f968454e-0
01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:00.130
More.

da655814-b2a6-4055-8b19-1c2b52a18504-0
01:48:02.170 --> 01:48:05.100
Images of the the the.

7845b6be-bce0-4149-aeb1-1837aaa54f57-0
01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.470
Pyramid like structure that
those the chimneys there are.

7a976a0f-aab5-4080-8012-8ccff46179b7-0
01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.110
Various machines floating
through the air.

25769c4b-1dac-470a-b3d5-2f0355442018-0
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:24.331
And again the ground is is is
covered with with snow very

25769c4b-1dac-470a-b3d5-2f0355442018-1
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:25.520
gloomy theme.

105088b9-9b34-4a71-a0d1-d0f1a8302eef-0
01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.780
And now we're, we're, we're,
we're back in a in a in a room.

97c87cac-b80a-488e-8f68-d035cf93fc6e-0
01:48:34.710 --> 01:48:35.780
The.

b5fa1f9a-d2f6-4ae9-b44c-517f18693635-0
01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:41.931
There are little things popping
out of the pot that we saw

b5fa1f9a-d2f6-4ae9-b44c-517f18693635-1
01:48:41.931 --> 01:48:46.600
before. The the wing creature
comes and we see that they're

b5fa1f9a-d2f6-4ae9-b44c-517f18693635-2
01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.690
they're small.

65624bd3-1d53-489d-9198-1faed10a8396-0
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:53.314
Children of this wing creature
and the the creature has come to

65624bd3-1d53-489d-9198-1faed10a8396-1
01:48:53.314 --> 01:48:56.290
to feed them. We we pull back
and we see.

48eda1b9-a0d3-41ae-b252-991de502aef6-0
01:48:58.290 --> 01:48:58.860
Uh.

c63eaa33-f172-4146-8790-28dd1b8dfd34-0
01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:06.051
The the man looking at a a
picture of a of a family with

c63eaa33-f172-4146-8790-28dd1b8dfd34-1
01:49:06.051 --> 01:49:11.475
this pot in in the background.
It's in the it's in a window, in

c63eaa33-f172-4146-8790-28dd1b8dfd34-2
01:49:11.475 --> 01:49:16.731
fact, with the wing creature
peeking its little ones, and the

c63eaa33-f172-4146-8790-28dd1b8dfd34-3
01:49:16.731 --> 01:49:21.816
the man sitting on his bed
looking at this picture. There's

c63eaa33-f172-4146-8790-28dd1b8dfd34-4
01:49:21.816 --> 01:49:22.410
a desk.

e5a6018b-190d-4362-bafa-1f1ed1876f40-0
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:28.940
And and and just a kind of a a
bedroom scene with the with the

e5a6018b-190d-4362-bafa-1f1ed1876f40-1
01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:33.448
mouse like creature sitting on
the bed beside him. We focused

e5a6018b-190d-4362-bafa-1f1ed1876f40-2
01:49:33.448 --> 01:49:35.630
in on the the that mouse like.

a7b8b1c4-b4d5-4f95-9999-57615f02acaa-0
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:37.090
Creature.

2a4a84be-73a1-4d8f-856d-28fefd3571c3-0
01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:44.374
It it jumps off the bed, man
wonders where it's gone. And it

2a4a84be-73a1-4d8f-856d-28fefd3571c3-1
01:49:44.374 --> 01:49:47.800
it goes down a ladder. The man
follows.

168f970a-96e1-498c-92ea-707fbea1c478-0
01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:49.240
And.

ecf1e4d9-040c-43d7-a61a-798a20e8251d-0
01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:56.290
We see a letter which is maybe a
reply to the letter the man

ecf1e4d9-040c-43d7-a61a-798a20e8251d-1
01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:59.010
sent. He picks it up, opens it.

9af0c911-9d88-40f3-9a0c-0001a0c9c4d5-0
01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:05.259
And there's the bird. Oh, So
what probably happened is that

9af0c911-9d88-40f3-9a0c-0001a0c9c4d5-1
01:50:05.259 --> 01:50:09.948
this is a this is different,
man. I I think this this looks

9af0c911-9d88-40f3-9a0c-0001a0c9c4d5-2
01:50:09.948 --> 01:50:10.730
like they.

e7dfbd77-fb8c-4d7c-8c0a-291150622205-0
01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:17.358
The the The the father of the of
the boy who was in the previous

e7dfbd77-fb8c-4d7c-8c0a-291150622205-1
01:50:17.358 --> 01:50:22.950
story. So maybe it's it's what
we call the man in the in the

e7dfbd77-fb8c-4d7c-8c0a-291150622205-2
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:23.500
first.

92815439-995d-4642-a329-b67eed6bdfb8-0
01:50:25.650 --> 01:50:30.260
in the first story sent a letter
to the.

b5a9997b-41e6-4800-a9a4-b3615190c2ad-0
01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:38.026
so what what we call the father
and and he's received it, sees

b5a9997b-41e6-4800-a9a4-b3615190c2ad-1
01:50:38.026 --> 01:50:43.533
the little origami bird. Down
comes him using the ladder and

b5a9997b-41e6-4800-a9a4-b3615190c2ad-2
01:50:43.533 --> 01:50:45.790
and looks out the window.

436bcee5-71e7-4c80-aa8b-4f302bc589a9-0
01:50:47.110 --> 01:50:47.980
Wondering.

44fb7bba-a3db-4217-bd3a-57f133a2c553-0
01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:53.050
Like where does this come from
or how it came to be.

c98de16f-4320-4274-9970-ee1ff5716aec-0
01:50:54.150 --> 01:50:59.770
Maybe it was the mobile
letterbox that brought it and.

fe2ccd23-ed6d-48d8-a4cd-dad1acaeed1a-0
01:51:00.450 --> 01:51:01.730
Here we see.

3e3df66d-57c6-442b-bb81-a594a5ee7021-0
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:03.420
An origami.

8b5a9aa1-56c5-428f-8f76-6c40d95b8f2f-0
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:11.820
Creature, which is maybe like
the one that fed the birds. The.

d9a90382-d230-488e-a69e-2ad6d4d6577f-0
01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:13.160


a96a7e9f-2684-401a-aa51-1dea0d2e1cad-0
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:22.620
A mechanism, a clock like
mechanism, a hat on a peg.

66dcabbc-a837-4ba6-a6ce-d829eb848573-0
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:25.830
A bowl with a creature in it.

e4a2d2b5-1814-445d-9a4d-ae51ebdaed72-0
01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:28.240
A drawing of.

af4da88f-4b0a-4fa2-85cd-7dab0bdce48b-0
01:51:30.230 --> 01:51:33.150
um a, one of the flying
machines.

8abaf777-975d-47b9-9444-478c8dda007d-0
01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.580
A bell, a cup of coffee. The.

56295556-f1ee-4917-a1b7-007bc9ee4fe9-0
01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:42.940
The man.

5580cb9b-96e6-4d7e-a239-93a821c53bfd-0
01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:49.312
With the wife and daughter and
and money being given into a

5580cb9b-96e6-4d7e-a239-93a821c53bfd-1
01:51:49.312 --> 01:51:53.610
little hand, which is probably
the girl's hand.

8a83b1d4-e19c-433f-9f15-7a1b3f0c9413-0
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.450
And.

58497841-ec33-4612-8a95-e5088fbda75a-0
01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:05.306
Now we pull back and and what we
see is that all those are all

58497841-ec33-4612-8a95-e5088fbda75a-1
01:52:05.306 --> 01:52:08.120
components of a a family scene.

8218f2a4-224b-4acf-9a15-29a0d26cd221-0
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:12.010
With the with the the man.

7bef6411-4015-4a3d-8bce-5d838a6f04bc-0
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:17.187
Father I'm I'm I'm confused
about which man is which,

7bef6411-4015-4a3d-8bce-5d838a6f04bc-1
01:52:17.187 --> 01:52:21.794
actually. That maybe the father
and the mother and the the girl

7bef6411-4015-4a3d-8bce-5d838a6f04bc-2
01:52:21.794 --> 01:52:22.730
with the the.

89de8ca3-4485-4b1a-9592-59321dd93f0f-0
01:52:24.150 --> 01:52:28.992
That this this looks like the
original man that we're calling

89de8ca3-4485-4b1a-9592-59321dd93f0f-1
01:52:28.992 --> 01:52:30.320
the man, and one.

f689d99c-3069-4c3e-8d58-ffdf642484b8-0
01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:35.661
Clue is that the mouse like
creature is there too, but those

f689d99c-3069-4c3e-8d58-ffdf642484b8-1
01:52:35.661 --> 01:52:38.920
those individual snippets we saw
were little.

d169f833-a688-4681-81fc-967136ab2138-0
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:45.413
Pieces of of that, of that
family scene. So anyway the the

d169f833-a688-4681-81fc-967136ab2138-1
01:52:45.413 --> 01:52:50.340
the girl puts her boots on, her
Wellington boots and.

69cd6347-ef5f-4304-970c-45b47f2f90ff-0
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:55.885
The the mouse like creature
brings her hat. She puts that on

69cd6347-ef5f-4304-970c-45b47f2f90ff-1
01:52:55.885 --> 01:52:57.840
and they're they're going out.

db7db7c3-9473-45ea-8c33-6fdc99622b55-0
01:52:58.550 --> 01:53:00.660
Or for a walk.

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:03.920
And.

f17f8f8f-bd5f-4cf4-ad8c-ff6d3fd1269c-0
01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:09.550
She finds something on the floor
which turns out to be this

f17f8f8f-bd5f-4cf4-ad8c-ff6d3fd1269c-1
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:13.580
bright thing, which she tosses
into the air. #END_arrival_6

01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:20.039
OK, so that was the story.
Sorry, we're running over, but

91af2f7c-1f96-4594-987b-45201450fbf3-1
01:53:20.039 --> 01:53:24.860
we have one last complex scene
left. Yeah, let's finish it. OK.

b0f7d493-fcce-408f-a86b-7552f77b038a-0
01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:31.597

park scene.

5a05396c-d259-460e-a06e-aeda2a63de7a-0
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.810
And.

b80b389b-7c95-4f39-b404-343a7cc26edd-0
01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:44.724
The at the top we see a bunch of
children waiting to go down one

b80b389b-7c95-4f39-b404-343a7cc26edd-1
01:53:44.724 --> 01:53:51.610
of several water pipes. There's
a red one, yellow one, a green

b80b389b-7c95-4f39-b404-343a7cc26edd-2
01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:58.496
one, and they all empty out into
this big pool where there are

b80b389b-7c95-4f39-b404-343a7cc26edd-3
01:53:58.496 --> 01:54:01.120
there are lots of other.

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.600
Uh.

efadd2cf-9d26-4aec-a4af-4e2fff63bdf3-0
01:54:11.050 --> 01:54:13.290
A model of.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.390
Pirate ship.

1df3b36a-dd04-4b19-9eb4-1395570eafd1-0
01:54:16.610 --> 01:54:23.498
With a with a big slide also
going down into that same pool

1df3b36a-dd04-4b19-9eb4-1395570eafd1-1
01:54:23.498 --> 01:54:28.550
with water. Oh, so somebody
actually has a.

ca3f6ce2-236a-44cf-9850-e9e4441e3d9c-0
01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:33.251
Don't know whether it's a squirt
gun or something, but he's

ca3f6ce2-236a-44cf-9850-e9e4441e3d9c-1
01:54:33.251 --> 01:54:37.061
pouring water out and landing on
the head of somebody in the in

ca3f6ce2-236a-44cf-9850-e9e4441e3d9c-2
01:54:37.061 --> 01:54:38.550
the pool to their dismay.

846b4bff-526d-4c96-85c8-2653f4e2b67b-0
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.269
We we see on the right hand side
another set of slides. They look

846b4bff-526d-4c96-85c8-2653f4e2b67b-1
01:54:45.269 --> 01:54:49.259
like maybe they're for for
racing. They're all parallel and

846b4bff-526d-4c96-85c8-2653f4e2b67b-2
01:54:49.259 --> 01:54:53.250
people are going down them and
landing in the in the water.

a1daf2a6-00f3-42a8-9cf7-606baae0f156-0
01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:54.970
Um.

db92d745-4927-4188-abb7-636d3e329f94-0
01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.130
We we see.

418b1fa1-7f8d-4b87-9557-8c7c18b36ca1-0
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.260
A set of stepping stones.

b4f1b97f-9a16-44cc-8fda-8af92afd2d83-0
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:06.950
Which seemed to be a little
unsteady. People are trying to

b4f1b97f-9a16-44cc-8fda-8af92afd2d83-1
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:11.138
walk across them, but wobbling
and falling into the into the

b4f1b97f-9a16-44cc-8fda-8af92afd2d83-2
01:55:11.138 --> 01:55:11.550
water.

dda03f14-d605-4fbb-a7ff-3217f5a49fbc-0
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:20.083
There's a little pier that goes
out into the middle of this pool

dda03f14-d605-4fbb-a7ff-3217f5a49fbc-1
01:55:20.083 --> 01:55:26.830
and what look maybe like parents
standing on the on the edge.

e4591db0-dd40-43a4-a2e4-db9fd0ca8774-0
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:32.913
There's a Penguin in there
holding a a red something or

e4591db0-dd40-43a4-a2e4-db9fd0ca8774-1
01:55:32.913 --> 01:55:33.360
other.

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:43.412
The there are and and there's. I
see a Penguin in the in the

5d812edb-564b-4696-a5d9-2758f125fbb9-1
01:55:43.412 --> 01:55:47.500
water too, next to this long
rideable.

01:55:48.710 --> 01:55:54.989
Serpent like toy that the whole
whole bunch of kids are just

7c16346f-9d6c-4f5e-a5c6-863661246e03-1
01:55:54.989 --> 01:55:55.710
riding.

01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.790
They.

440420d4-a9dd-4d47-809a-c3369b50e473-0
01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:04.100
There are some large balls in in
the water.

68653eba-f5ad-4269-b5f3-541299a99f52-0
01:56:05.050 --> 01:56:05.440

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:07.790
There's a.

8a22223d-3dd3-4186-9041-21294512f116-0
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:09.920
The side of the.

f9dabe65-9bf6-438a-94e7-f61b7f8600fe-0
01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:17.297
Of the of the pool separates the
main pool from what I think is

f9dabe65-9bf6-438a-94e7-f61b7f8600fe-1
01:56:17.297 --> 01:56:19.370
kind of a lazy river.

7d25fe07-1ed6-4ff9-b329-f58826c87a3a-0
01:56:20.230 --> 01:56:26.740
Kind of arrangement with people
floating along on rubber rings.

3ebff7bb-560e-4ff9-b208-3d46af283f4a-0
01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:32.866
Even they're not safe from
getting squirted. Somebody is on

3ebff7bb-560e-4ff9-b208-3d46af283f4a-1
01:56:32.866 --> 01:56:35.290
a bridge over that Lazy River.

db7c3f77-1fbf-4f40-b455-14d40f9c3b74-0
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:41.687
Squirting one of the girls in in
the in one of the rubber rings.

db7c3f77-1fbf-4f40-b455-14d40f9c3b74-1
01:56:41.687 --> 01:56:46.825
By the side, there of the lazy
river, there's a grassy area

db7c3f77-1fbf-4f40-b455-14d40f9c3b74-2
01:56:46.825 --> 01:56:50.679
where people lounging around and
sunbathing.

f7575da7-c764-40f8-96eb-aba40441cf4f-0
01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:54.540
Those are a model elephant.

d7200b41-950c-41b7-a7de-12def0337db7-0
01:56:55.950 --> 01:57:00.107
By the side of the Lazy River
with water squirting out of its

d7200b41-950c-41b7-a7de-12def0337db7-1
01:57:00.107 --> 01:57:00.510
trunk.

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.780
Over the lazy River, there's a
lifeguard.

Who who is just chatting and not
really paying attention to

df27d575-5dcf-4dcb-8548-bbb1e49396a4-1
01:57:09.291 --> 01:57:09.760
anything.

Yeah. Thank you.
