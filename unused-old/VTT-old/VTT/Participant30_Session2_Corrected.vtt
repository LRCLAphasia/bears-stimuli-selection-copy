00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.870
So just like last time, describe
what you see and.

bd6bec2c-e921-479d-8192-df752aa63520-0
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.730
Um, what is happening in the
story?}

55d2b7c1-bfad-4d20-877f-7133aed377e4-0
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.940
{OK.}

0718f1e5-4959-43f0-8ae3-5089d5005342-0
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.642
#START_wanderer So there was a
big tidal wave and on the left

0718f1e5-4959-43f0-8ae3-5089d5005342-1
00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.420
side of the page.

a4dd15b1-e2ed-474a-b92b-114c4a8188cb-0
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.100
The the boat is underneath the
the wave and it's in a.

eda0e044-1b03-465b-a621-b31846c33731-0
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.895
Vertical position and on the
right side there is some type of

eda0e044-1b03-465b-a621-b31846c33731-1
00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.610
sea creature.

eef5bac0-bac4-48cf-b3f6-9ba13fb47034-0
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.440
That there's a striped fish at
the bottom there is a.

0da06597-5f03-4cbe-9b02-b5b54b416b1c-0
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.969
A mast and there's an A person,
some kind of creature on the

0da06597-5f03-4cbe-9b02-b5b54b416b1c-1
00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.360
horizontal part of the mast and
he's looks like he's.

1cd3f9ac-eb24-4284-b746-4ab158c4cf44-0
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.570
Going to throw a paper airplane
at the.

e0b6760e-3a97-4eac-8232-86af45cbffb3-0
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.198
At the wave and to to his right
is a cat on a string that's

e0b6760e-3a97-4eac-8232-86af45cbffb3-1
00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:41.596
connected from the the mast to a
kite with a big hole in it. The

e0b6760e-3a97-4eac-8232-86af45cbffb3-2
00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:48.197
kite is has a dark background
with bright stars on it and

e0b6760e-3a97-4eac-8232-86af45cbffb3-3
00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:54.685
there's a big rip in the half
and so there are two small

e0b6760e-3a97-4eac-8232-86af45cbffb3-4
00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.620
children who are.

02b7cc88-f39c-423e-8acd-b3b1de39d947-0
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.100
Holding on to the kite.

40d1ff77-1f18-4d9a-9f4e-e0b326e6fda6-0
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.600
That's all.

1afa2a85-cf0a-4586-9aae-ff9a3aeb5bb9-0
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.150
OK, here on the left side of the
page, the little boat is on.

469daed3-719d-44a2-93d3-6edea28de4c0-0
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.296
On the sea and there's a
lightning storm in the

469daed3-719d-44a2-93d3-6edea28de4c0-1
00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:22.344
background. You can see a
lightning strike coming down

469daed3-719d-44a2-93d3-6edea28de4c0-2
00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:28.035
from the clouds into the sea,
and it's a very dark and cloudy

469daed3-719d-44a2-93d3-6edea28de4c0-3
00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:33.451
sky. And on the right side the,
the, the paper airplane is

469daed3-719d-44a2-93d3-6edea28de4c0-4
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:39.142
hurling across the sky, over the
sea. And it's a again a very

469daed3-719d-44a2-93d3-6edea28de4c0-5
00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:43.090
dark, even a darker sky than the
previous.

52fede01-0c7b-476f-82d6-b0e670b632e0-0
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.050
Frame with some clouds.

cdd46e6b-81ea-40f5-a965-6eec25e8c43f-0
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.480
In the sky.

22fb6ef9-ba1e-4f14-8e60-e996c8072174-0
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.910
OK.

a77d61ae-9a3c-4366-8133-497ad37bd445-0
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.590
This.

8677396a-c7b9-4843-9bff-91c3cbb603c7-0
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.220


5313a1ad-12f5-46d5-8809-05a014a67007-0
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.083
OK, this is a scene where the
the the little boat is on the

5313a1ad-12f5-46d5-8809-05a014a67007-1
00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.960
sea and they look like Donuts.

8d38aed0-cf2d-455e-8ee9-7a1bdeaac812-0
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.310
And it's sailing in between, but
we look to the next page and.

e0bde393-9f1a-4263-acb2-0a7472dc226a-0
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.161
It may not be doughnuts, but
maybe a sea creature like an eel

e0bde393-9f1a-4263-acb2-0a7472dc226a-1
00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:23.110
or snake that that's very long
and it's.

6b67429e-5f5e-4d08-b566-4e44cc647cba-0
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.247
It's got two tiny feet and it's
mouth has grasped the paper

6b67429e-5f5e-4d08-b566-4e44cc647cba-1
00:03:32.247 --> 00:03:33.410
airplane.

1825fc99-7cba-4165-b6da-b2d5d82bd537-0
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.343
And here on the left side we see
a dragon that's in a in a cave.

1825fc99-7cba-4165-b6da-b2d5d82bd537-1
00:03:45.343 --> 00:03:48.570
Looks like it's a series of
caves.

b262f2d3-969c-49da-b0f5-1f9bbfbda29d-0
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.929
But it's it's the creature from
the previous page, and in the

b262f2d3-969c-49da-b0f5-1f9bbfbda29d-1
00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:57.680
next scene we see.

4fad5776-98d2-446f-bf5e-0a9dfa5ab42c-0
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.260


aae9e0cc-ec19-4574-a002-cab99c4304a2-0
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.380
Two creatures, the one on the
left.

9800ca29-a6a4-4927-8577-9891fbe1dbe2-0
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.770
Looks a little bit like.

0ab85949-518a-4195-afc3-40ffc5c793b8-0
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.260
Get rid of this thing.

38d5adfa-fe70-4a14-8c2a-dc18afcdd849-0
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.060
Looks a little bit like ohh.

b75e5176-9191-4042-b6d2-c90f04f9a9b0-0
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.154
The little boat is in the water
like in the midst of the eel,

b75e5176-9191-4042-b6d2-c90f04f9a9b0-1
00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:31.925
and then we see two other
creatures. One has a a head,

b75e5176-9191-4042-b6d2-c90f04f9a9b0-2
00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:38.534
sort of like an elephant with a
spikes coming out of its trunk

b75e5176-9191-4042-b6d2-c90f04f9a9b0-3
00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:44.620
and the other is is a type of
looks like a type of whale.

108b83b0-67d1-419c-b597-25cf32ea1850-0
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.297
Or type of lizard with a long,
long, sharp horn coming out of

108b83b0-67d1-419c-b597-25cf32ea1850-1
00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:53.130
its head.

ec943427-4a93-46ff-95f5-62ad55f9e273-0
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.000
And this we see.

2227907a-cab7-474a-a9fa-52d1d2bdfde3-0
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.460
The the.

e40d8fcb-1084-45cc-9f43-71bb0e6fa607-0
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.660
The little boat.

4632f8a8-bc6b-46ea-b067-1fb6a8c4be68-0
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.605
Is in the water and those two
creatures that I just described

4632f8a8-bc6b-46ea-b067-1fb6a8c4be68-1
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.900
are to its left and the one with
the.

53dd41e9-e803-4a59-b1fa-7ee8fe8b11d4-0
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.358
Horn coming out of its head is
shooting 2 streams of water from

53dd41e9-e803-4a59-b1fa-7ee8fe8b11d4-1
00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:27.910
its nostrils.

b2a61515-6fdb-4d4b-935b-618dc1855fde-0
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.610
Into the.

5af9ed5f-730b-4df7-9161-16d93f45efbc-0
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.502
Into the little boat and one on
the side of the to the side of

5af9ed5f-730b-4df7-9161-16d93f45efbc-1
00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:41.602
the boat. And then the other
creature that has a head like an

5af9ed5f-730b-4df7-9161-16d93f45efbc-2
00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:46.784
elephant is just standing there
and watching. And to the right

5af9ed5f-730b-4df7-9161-16d93f45efbc-3
00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:51.884
of that we see a creature of
fish like creature with legs and

5af9ed5f-730b-4df7-9161-16d93f45efbc-4
00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:57.067
long fins standing on a beach
that's littered with bottles and

5af9ed5f-730b-4df7-9161-16d93f45efbc-5
00:05:57.067 --> 00:06:01.179
cans and other types of trash.
And at this point.

7468ad5f-7efb-4322-b7d0-ffd3cb52d9f2-0
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.432
He's looking out into the sea
and the little boat is a

7468ad5f-7efb-4322-b7d0-ffd3cb52d9f2-1
00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.690
distance from the shore.

588d505f-e206-4fa0-950c-be73ddf0bdce-0
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.110
So here on the left side.

d3da4172-2f16-415f-ad59-a0732f84be28-0
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.670
Of the page, we see that the
little boat is in the water

d3da4172-2f16-415f-ad59-a0732f84be28-1
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.838
underneath water, and it's in
the midst of many jellyfish. And

d3da4172-2f16-415f-ad59-a0732f84be28-2
00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:36.713
then next, then on the right,
there is one jellyfish that's

d3da4172-2f16-415f-ad59-a0732f84be28-3
00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:40.140
larger than all the rest and
it's.

aeadf88e-38be-4d73-b7d2-3e7d78dc6b6c-0
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.313
It's got like a sun in the
middle with the beams coming

aeadf88e-38be-4d73-b7d2-3e7d78dc6b6c-1
00:06:47.313 --> 00:06:49.120
from all around it.

196efc9e-f7d3-4443-af07-d7cbcb7f6a48-0
00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.492
Here on the left side we see
that the little boat is in front

196efc9e-f7d3-4443-af07-d7cbcb7f6a48-1
00:07:01.492 --> 00:07:08.655
of a a school of fish that look
like flounder, and at the bottom

196efc9e-f7d3-4443-af07-d7cbcb7f6a48-2
00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:15.598
we see a deep sea fish that's
approaching some type of smaller

196efc9e-f7d3-4443-af07-d7cbcb7f6a48-3
00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:16.589
creature.

342fbea7-ce5f-452e-9e2f-36447c048234-0
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.333
On the right side we see this
the smaller a lot of small

342fbea7-ce5f-452e-9e2f-36447c048234-1
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:29.351
creatures, sea creatures that
aren't necessarily fish and and

342fbea7-ce5f-452e-9e2f-36447c048234-2
00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:35.564
then one large that looks like a
jellyfish that looks like it's

342fbea7-ce5f-452e-9e2f-36447c048234-3
00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:40.029
about to develop the boat deep
under the sea.

960ea77b-77f9-42ec-95d5-412957a763a1-0
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.470
And in this.

8fcd3291-04ec-4c7d-b811-cd7a4973ad53-0
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.730
We see at the bottom of the.

44194790-870e-4fdb-9a44-0abfa5d62f9b-0
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.700
At the ocean floor.

53c3bc4c-d5c0-42a2-93a7-33698c1483b1-0
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.868
Three creatures that look like a
have like Caterpillar bodies

53c3bc4c-d5c0-42a2-93a7-33698c1483b1-1
00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:11.767
with legs on them and they're
sort of frolicking and it looks

53c3bc4c-d5c0-42a2-93a7-33698c1483b1-2
00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:17.951
like a flower or plant but it's
it's difficult to tell. And then

53c3bc4c-d5c0-42a2-93a7-33698c1483b1-3
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:23.469
on the right side of that there
is like a submarine with.

d798d581-1235-4242-ba35-1ab9c4856dce-0
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.334
Creatures or things flying
around or swimming around in the

d798d581-1235-4242-ba35-1ab9c4856dce-1
00:08:39.334 --> 00:08:45.404
ocean depths and it looks like
they have light emanating from

d798d581-1235-4242-ba35-1ab9c4856dce-2
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:51.670
their eyes and the little boat
is on the nose of the submarine.

25b63323-a74c-4561-9a2e-1e90b5f001dc-0
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.652
And this we see that the little
boat is on the nose of the

25b63323-a74c-4561-9a2e-1e90b5f001dc-1
00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:07.140
submarine, but the submarine has
now broken the surface of the

25b63323-a74c-4561-9a2e-1e90b5f001dc-2
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.560
sea, and to its right is a
fishing vessel that.

4a6afa23-4741-43b1-b97d-64043e26e3d8-0
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:17.760
It looks like there's a whale
with all kinds of tentacles.

0db542dc-55ea-484a-8aea-e3d45ec9f3b7-0
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.329
Or maybe maybe two different
creatures that are at the back

0db542dc-55ea-484a-8aea-e3d45ec9f3b7-1
00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:30.658
of the back of the fishing boat.
The the sky is filled with

0db542dc-55ea-484a-8aea-e3d45ec9f3b7-2
00:09:30.658 --> 00:09:35.810
seagulls and the ocean depths
are filled with a a school.

233f0b15-daef-4c04-8919-9b6d88c9ef06-0
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:06.709
OK, OK, here we see that it's a
fairly clear sky, a few public

233f0b15-daef-4c04-8919-9b6d88c9ef06-1
00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:14.300
clouds, and it's daylight. The
sea is clear. There are some.

b39073f9-7a1a-4734-88de-d2f6fa92f467-0
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:23.071
Seals playing with the boat and
one seal has is balancing it on

b39073f9-7a1a-4734-88de-d2f6fa92f467-1
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:29.268
its snout while the other three
are swimming around it. Just

b39073f9-7a1a-4734-88de-d2f6fa92f467-2
00:10:29.268 --> 00:10:35.160
looking underneath. There are a
half a dozen or so other.

3f80c346-5ea7-4886-8a44-632f8eb4baaa-0
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.587
Other seals swimming around and
then to the right of them is a

3f80c346-5ea7-4886-8a44-632f8eb4baaa-1
00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.850
some vegetation on a.

ca7785d0-b962-4747-bc27-3c997bcce0c1-0
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.603
And there are other seals and
fish swimming amongst the

ca7785d0-b962-4747-bc27-3c997bcce0c1-1
00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:54.700
vegetation.

0cccc3fd-b526-4032-b996-0ca183271521-0
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:16.510
One on the left there are
jellyfish and seaweed and Fern

0cccc3fd-b526-4032-b996-0ca183271521-1
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:22.521
like plants that are growing
from the ocean floor. A few

0cccc3fd-b526-4032-b996-0ca183271521-2
00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:29.164
other striped fish sort of like
manta rays, and the one on the

0cccc3fd-b526-4032-b996-0ca183271521-3
00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:30.429
right shows.

the sea. And he's.

f4ca48fa-d374-45d3-a934-85f3d8eb07ec-0
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.472
He he's holding something about
as big as a basketball, and it

f4ca48fa-d374-45d3-a934-85f3d8eb07ec-1
00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:49.140
looks like a Pearl that he's
either.

d46e57b9-69b5-40c0-bd95-80352158fa78-0
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.677
Has picked up or is putting
down. He's just standing there

d46e57b9-69b5-40c0-bd95-80352158fa78-1
00:11:53.677 --> 00:11:54.600

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.130
There are several sea creatures
around him.

7a9b8ccd-cb16-456b-b104-6af8bdaeab80-0
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.290
Like mushrooms. Or maybe they're
clams that are on the on the.

becab1d3-ee78-4327-afab-32ae0f81e56c-0
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.120

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:33.713
OK, here we see a a boy on the
water. And on the boy are a

030dbec2-982f-4d1a-829f-be07ad5a8dfc-1
00:12:33.713 --> 00:12:40.551

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:47.390
There's that striped eel and the
deep sea diver is riding the.

8ab21591-56b4-4140-a88b-0b0e44a740b2-0
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:54.156

00:12:54.156 --> 00:13:00.206
are a couple of creatures that
are climbing on the boy. The the

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.825
Cylinder with the Round Top on
it, and the lighthouse is a

e9153abe-a578-4944-b280-9c2ba61e7c0f-1
00:13:30.825 --> 00:13:35.494
cylinder with a a lighthouse on
top of it. There are several

e9153abe-a578-4944-b280-9c2ba61e7c0f-2
00:13:35.494 --> 00:13:40.010
windows in them, and to the

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.200
Of boats, ships.

feaec769-1342-4a4a-b256-acff1b3b9117-0
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.159

the the two little boats. Paper

feaec769-1342-4a4a-b256-acff1b3b9117-1
00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:58.350
boats are next to the boy and in
front of the lighthouse.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.920
So in this picture we see that
there are there are some.

0e3d6818-0380-4e45-8993-07e719cea508-0
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.080
Clouds or maybe smoke from the.

05fb6e40-d58f-4767-a405-4ac8eea1e6eb-0
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:22.330
Ships that are out to sea. There
is a tall ship in the in the

05fb6e40-d58f-4767-a405-4ac8eea1e6eb-1
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.050
distant background and across
the span of the. The painting is

05fb6e40-d58f-4767-a405-4ac8eea1e6eb-2
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:33.680
some type of bridge. The bridge
goes beyond our our distance,

05fb6e40-d58f-4767-a405-4ac8eea1e6eb-3
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.949
beyond the tall ship, and it
comes.

043fb280-29e2-45eb-9713-c554be8a3bcf-0
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.070
Up on the left hand side onto a
structure.

37f37221-3810-40a5-b993-2611db6d14af-0
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.480
that's um

b40dd7f0-fcf5-46e7-92f8-8dd123d4de91-0
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:52.875
Built some height from the
ground and on top of that it's

b40dd7f0-fcf5-46e7-92f8-8dd123d4de91-1
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:57.550
sort of like a a round building
with the.

378582dd-96be-4c2d-b40b-b184dfb939b4-0
00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:58.910


50dccd9a-76b6-4db6-9404-5f4013626115-0
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:06.846
flag flying and the little paper
boat is looks like it's in front

50dccd9a-76b6-4db6-9404-5f4013626115-1
00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:09.930
of this structure on the sea.

b3cbcd88-0286-49df-9f40-262ede4c9420-0
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.460
OK, we see the.

54d3f5c3-ff49-4ef2-9165-0cd1b484b264-0
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:19.640
the

f40eeaae-8375-4c50-84e9-87e2e71e3cb5-0
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.750
The rudder of a.

ce7b8864-4b18-4ce7-bcf5-b5aa0680ff94-0
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.610
Large.

b9eae762-3d32-4a31-9fe8-9b853723a302-0
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.130
Ship and we see on the ship, we
know. It's we know.

9c5b2da3-1820-4e76-b5bc-2d3f34e5d1a3-0
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.350
We see the anchor and the
propeller toward the.

9616212e-889c-4218-9581-e8bfac4bea73-0
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.320
And alongside of this.

aa86439c-ed0a-4669-bc38-23b7ec00df8b-0
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.520
Large ship as they looks like a.

ab2e018a-5bee-4691-848f-5134a36aad6b-0
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.619
Small fishing vessel and behind
it. Or maybe it looks like it's

ab2e018a-5bee-4691-848f-5134a36aad6b-1
00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:55.320
carrying or pulling a a sailboat
alongside it.

cda18248-e608-49c8-8e48-a601c7e29419-0
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.410
On the.

17d181b2-c054-4bc4-a2ae-4c0c4a2b8165-0
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:05.594
Ocean in the ocean. Right behind
the large ship is a little

17d181b2-c054-4bc4-a2ae-4c0c4a2b8165-1
00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:13.107
submarine with that checkerboard
square on its skin, and in the

17d181b2-c054-4bc4-a2ae-4c0c4a2b8165-2
00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:19.330
background we see a number of
silos, tall buildings.

076f095a-2977-4efb-8c11-48d1d975287c-0
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.170
And puffy clouds in the sky.

585ef418-57e1-4878-8c80-6dc154f0606c-0
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.210
Here on the on the left we see
a.

3244aa8e-cf79-49dc-a5af-7f802f733688-0
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.480
On the sea the.

29bc4ec4-3c13-49bd-82eb-e655e7785719-0
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:53.107
It looks like it's it's got a
shower or something over its

29bc4ec4-3c13-49bd-82eb-e655e7785719-1
00:16:53.107 --> 00:16:59.298
head maybe to keep itself wet.
And the the creature looks like

29bc4ec4-3c13-49bd-82eb-e655e7785719-2
00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:05.784
he's talking to a man who's on a
fishing vessel or a tugboat, and

29bc4ec4-3c13-49bd-82eb-e655e7785719-3
00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:12.073
from that tugboat stands a large
zigzag ladder with a bucket on

29bc4ec4-3c13-49bd-82eb-e655e7785719-4
00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:17.380
it. And there's a a person in
that bucket looks like.

16202da9-da2b-4c55-840a-e5f74485ec54-0
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:23.201
He's talking to the whale. We
have a in the foreground. We

16202da9-da2b-4c55-840a-e5f74485ec54-1
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:24.950
have a a cone like

6acc96db-5c3b-42b8-bcfb-b7993accc726-0
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.896
And then on on the right of
that, we see a couple of large

6acc96db-5c3b-42b8-bcfb-b7993accc726-1
00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:45.761
ships looks like they're,
they're docked and standing on

6acc96db-5c3b-42b8-bcfb-b7993accc726-2
00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:51.139
the dock or a bunch of people
just looking out, looking at the

6acc96db-5c3b-42b8-bcfb-b7993accc726-3
00:17:51.139 --> 00:17:56.602
birds on top of the deck of the
ship. And we see that there are

6acc96db-5c3b-42b8-bcfb-b7993accc726-4
00:17:56.602 --> 00:18:01.638
a lot of people looking out
watching this spectacle of the

6acc96db-5c3b-42b8-bcfb-b7993accc726-5
00:18:01.638 --> 00:18:05.480
the whale and the man having a
conversation.

b6302178-77ea-4eda-b707-8d84fde448e3-0
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.570
And then we see some seagulls.

d2507901-0193-4616-a261-a50b0279fce5-0
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:15.087
The boat is in the lower right
hand corner of the picture

d2507901-0193-4616-a261-a50b0279fce5-1
00:18:15.087 --> 00:18:16.900
against the Stonewall.

8f425b49-53e5-4fbe-8e46-c27e05383d88-0
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.460
OK, here we see that it's.

10907a37-6496-4d3e-87f0-4d3093af4cf5-0
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:41.025
It's a dock where ships come and
have cargo loaded and unloaded.

10907a37-6496-4d3e-87f0-4d3093af4cf5-1
00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:42.560
There are three.

5dc4e55b-00fd-4e41-9adf-a7e36a4484d1-0
00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:00.399
It is a short building, but
long. It's dark. There are

5dc4e55b-00fd-4e41-9adf-a7e36a4484d1-1
00:19:00.399 --> 00:19:06.227
people walking in front of it.
To the right of that is a taller

5dc4e55b-00fd-4e41-9adf-a7e36a4484d1-2
00:19:06.227 --> 00:19:08.960
structure, sort of built like.

89ca270d-0d6c-4489-9c9b-3b1f3da2609e-0
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:17.105
This in the shape of a of a
church or the could be a hall

89ca270d-0d6c-4489-9c9b-3b1f3da2609e-1
00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:18.980
where they would.

c50e18e6-9b9b-4368-993f-a6c8b56862ab-0
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.350
Like a market.

61d02c6a-1ca0-4a52-a9d0-9a9007423589-0
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.014
There's a Stonewall that
separates the land from the sea

61d02c6a-1ca0-4a52-a9d0-9a9007423589-1
00:19:31.014 --> 00:19:34.850
and on the water here in front
of us, and we see a few.

c058c9ec-b920-4b5b-8721-ad362b0dfd25-0
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.514
People on it and some other
equipment. The other one has

c058c9ec-b920-4b5b-8721-ad362b0dfd25-1
00:19:46.514 --> 00:19:49.010
just two people on it. There's
a.

88fbf4be-d588-45e0-b861-ca6f36b828af-0
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.230
Type of umbrella.

a9175db4-7d01-4800-a4d5-513c7d3eebf0-0
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.270
On that boat with a little
windsock and the little.

4dcf323c-295e-40ed-bac0-aa0563650419-0
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:06.795
Paper boat is in the foreground
on the lower right. On the left

4dcf323c-295e-40ed-bac0-aa0563650419-1
00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:13.281
we see that the screen #9 has a
couple people standing in front

4dcf323c-295e-40ed-bac0-aa0563650419-2
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:14.700
of the camera.

ad90adba-144a-463f-a2c8-a1a7fe00a77b-0
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:29.296
Thing with a that has a globe on
top of it and it looks like the

ad90adba-144a-463f-a2c8-a1a7fe00a77b-1
00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:34.531
globe has people in it. Looks
like a boy with the striped

ad90adba-144a-463f-a2c8-a1a7fe00a77b-2
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:37.690
shirt and another person and
they.

68b250a4-ddb3-41e3-9e15-e21d5fc61ed7-0
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.210
Of.

3472a359-afec-4fe0-85fd-756644749367-0
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.923
The thing looks like a a fish
with a curly tail and so the the

3472a359-afec-4fe0-85fd-756644749367-1
00:20:46.923 --> 00:20:52.831
tail is dipped into the water
and you can see it has a couple

3472a359-afec-4fe0-85fd-756644749367-2
00:20:52.831 --> 00:20:54.070
of portholes.

847d956c-a8e0-4746-bc7d-8a0d4f0634cd-0
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.260
In this.

635763d8-766c-47b1-a77b-f7f6bf0cfce1-0
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.110
In this vessel and.

17a3f1f7-71f0-4bcf-8928-8726fc9cc6f7-0
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.210
It's up against a building.

2e08e25f-cfa1-4bfe-bdc0-92da3ab53153-0
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.660
OK, here we see in the water
again.

b517441b-9ebf-4cf8-ad75-ee64fd8f4686-0
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.040
A. A type of tugboat or fishing
vessel that has.

e6923c1f-2c81-42de-8574-6bfb88335721-0
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.300
And it's a net.

fd013a3e-0589-4aaa-a058-618ec6f0a627-0
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:36.030
It has the creature that has the
long horn coming out of its

fd013a3e-0589-4aaa-a058-618ec6f0a627-1
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:42.352
forehead and its grasped in a a
cargo net, sort of like it was

fd013a3e-0589-4aaa-a058-618ec6f0a627-2
00:21:42.352 --> 00:21:44.559
fishing for something.

0e4ca042-3d25-42a4-b820-6f39d64feae4-0
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.252
With a striped shirt and a cap
on and he's looking down at the

0e4ca042-3d25-42a4-b820-6f39d64feae4-1
00:21:57.252 --> 00:21:58.110
little paper boat.

95f0f132-16b5-4143-9b1d-c278315a4c81-0
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:06.069
And in the in the background
behind that is a domed building

95f0f132-16b5-4143-9b1d-c278315a4c81-1
00:22:06.069 --> 00:22:09.050
to the right of that or some.

fdaf0026-4109-4ab4-ae08-ecd94a30bb57-0
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.200


251ade68-39e1-4a6a-ad94-965866374cf7-0
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:18.031
Let's see, that would be that
that it's it's as big as

251ade68-39e1-4a6a-ad94-965866374cf7-1
00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:20.020
buildings, but it's a.

1721f481-37e5-432a-8c2e-5d40a50a6a30-0
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.730
The back of a ship one is called
Explorer.

6f26b0a5-aecb-44fb-a789-e1e9a2e7e6d8-0
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.690
Exploratio or something like
that.

ccc01262-4231-4a51-bc98-eaf7ffd5f6f0-0
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.380
And the little paper boat now is
behind those, those ships.

abe1d855-8c0f-47d0-b082-cd9ea5b5652f-0
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:50.912
Here we see a city. It looks
like there are some types of

abe1d855-8c0f-47d0-b082-cd9ea5b5652f-1
00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:55.880
onion Dome tops, to some of them
some circular.

be1a1480-ba21-4883-9744-5ede3ed6a6ba-0
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.900
Domes.

a6d00206-4acf-4278-bfe0-bb54029a181f-0
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.740
Tower in the foreground, that's
dark.

b2c071e5-5e93-4506-9502-32307f1965aa-0
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.070
Black and Gray stripes on it
with some windows.

e5129d44-4c22-414b-9522-86465be65f12-0
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:15.684
And just some modern buildings.
Looks like an older Renaissance

e5129d44-4c22-414b-9522-86465be65f12-1
00:23:15.684 --> 00:23:18.050
church in the background.

cdac37a0-32a3-4b7e-9767-4d42f80ad6e7-0
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:26.558
There is a looks like a deer or
a deer or an elk standing on top

cdac37a0-32a3-4b7e-9767-4d42f80ad6e7-1
00:23:26.558 --> 00:23:30.120
of one of the arched buildings.

2df1149d-7bbc-49ec-b69d-fc38f0ec7bb3-0
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.634
Like a canal through this town,
sort of like Venice. And the

2df1149d-7bbc-49ec-b69d-fc38f0ec7bb3-1
00:23:41.634 --> 00:23:46.910
little paper boat is sailing
along in the in the waterway.

a0f8e20e-4636-4978-a957-74c5fd3c0856-0
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.630
Yeah.

750e3d62-3453-4653-9264-8f7f8d3b86e0-0
00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:01.651
OK, here we see a different view
of the the town with the the

750e3d62-3453-4653-9264-8f7f8d3b86e0-1
00:24:01.651 --> 00:24:06.764
canal and then a number of
arches that go over the canal

750e3d62-3453-4653-9264-8f7f8d3b86e0-2
00:24:06.764 --> 00:24:12.505
connecting one side to the other
set of steps coming down. Also

750e3d62-3453-4653-9264-8f7f8d3b86e0-3
00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:18.336
in the water is the second boat
we see a a someone sitting on on

750e3d62-3453-4653-9264-8f7f8d3b86e0-4
00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:20.399
the steps close to the.

764181fa-efc7-4e96-a6cf-ca55ace041af-0
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:27.206
Edge of the water and a serpent
like creature in the sea. It's

764181fa-efc7-4e96-a6cf-ca55ace041af-1
00:24:27.206 --> 00:24:32.764
got stripes on it. To the left
of this we see a number of

764181fa-efc7-4e96-a6cf-ca55ace041af-2
00:24:32.764 --> 00:24:38.993
animals. There's a cat, there's
a horse with a man riding on it.

764181fa-efc7-4e96-a6cf-ca55ace041af-3
00:24:38.993 --> 00:24:39.760
The man.

d7be16df-a81a-48c6-ae5b-1da2dd1069fa-0
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:06.189
One of the steps looking at the
at the canal and there are a few

d7be16df-a81a-48c6-ae5b-1da2dd1069fa-1
00:25:06.189 --> 00:25:07.030
children.

88739a5b-5e0c-4050-932d-007b9a7f53b1-0
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:12.395
Climbing up the steps, there's
the man who was wearing a deep

88739a5b-5e0c-4050-932d-007b9a7f53b1-1
00:25:12.395 --> 00:25:13.230
sea diving.

67325f3e-6b2a-45e1-b8ae-6e6584fe433b-0
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.430
Outfit standing on the steps and
there's another.

46b0cc19-776a-40e1-81b6-54704c0328b5-0
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:23.670
A person dressed like a clown in
a checkerboard type of outfit.

245b0939-3ece-4162-b12e-e50684d36341-0
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.290
OK, and this. Now it's night we
see them.

7bc00c73-bd43-479c-a716-68e4be74841a-0
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:44.863
Lots of stars in the sky and the
little boat is on the canal in

7bc00c73-bd43-479c-a716-68e4be74841a-1
00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:50.897
between the the two sides of the
of the canal to its right it's

7bc00c73-bd43-479c-a716-68e4be74841a-2
00:25:50.897 --> 00:25:56.931
just a a building looks like a
house a little fishing boat that

7bc00c73-bd43-479c-a716-68e4be74841a-3
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:57.779
with the.

7914b2b9-5c7f-4436-a806-6b5946e71647-0
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.950
Little Hut on it where the
fishermen can stay.

c62a9750-3378-44d8-9106-49f5feb38988-0
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.480
And then

e0213ccb-2007-4ca4-ad9c-3805730d7c3f-0
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.160
To the left of the boat.

cb7dbf95-fa5d-4ada-9af2-bba9b404f707-0
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.579
Checkerboard covering on it and
four fish in the foreground.

cb7dbf95-fa5d-4ada-9af2-bba9b404f707-1
00:26:18.579 --> 00:26:23.561
They're above the water and
there are steps leading up to

cb7dbf95-fa5d-4ada-9af2-bba9b404f707-2
00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:28.628
houses or apartments on the left
side and with some street

cb7dbf95-fa5d-4ada-9af2-bba9b404f707-3
00:26:28.628 --> 00:26:29.229
lights.

8d5d8f6f-db86-4747-8729-f7b9550b21c2-0
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.682
OK, here we see a series of
pictures. The one on on the left

8d5d8f6f-db86-4747-8729-f7b9550b21c2-1
00:26:41.682 --> 00:26:47.022
side of the page is a. The
little paper boat is on the

8d5d8f6f-db86-4747-8729-f7b9550b21c2-2
00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:50.130
water and is a a wall with some.

e3f1d912-d086-43cc-bbbe-121d489ba63d-0
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:57.320
Of the trees around it and
behind the the wall. And then

e3f1d912-d086-43cc-bbbe-121d489ba63d-1
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.971
there's a street light that
shines in front of a a house

e3f1d912-d086-43cc-bbbe-121d489ba63d-2
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:05.450
that's a two-story house.

797c6b33-66b8-4f36-a76a-ada76c8cf1e6-0
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:15.450
And so from the top left going
right and then down, we see the.

95e73a10-80a4-423c-bf6d-63efb0406829-0
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.912
Paper boat on the water in front
of the wall and then we see in

95e73a10-80a4-423c-bf6d-63efb0406829-1
00:27:22.912 --> 00:27:28.891
the next frame some type of
creature has gotten into the

95e73a10-80a4-423c-bf6d-63efb0406829-2
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:34.450
boat and we see it. Another in
the 3rd frame we see.

c860258b-c415-4ee1-b11c-280be1461c77-0
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.070
a different type of

43c03b31-799c-4d0e-8643-5bd46f87bd56-0
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:44.061
Creature looks like it's sitting
in the boat facing the steps.

43c03b31-799c-4d0e-8643-5bd46f87bd56-1
00:27:44.061 --> 00:27:49.812
There are steps that lead up to
the lead up the wall, and then

43c03b31-799c-4d0e-8643-5bd46f87bd56-2
00:27:49.812 --> 00:27:55.563
in the 4th frame we faintly see
the little boat and we see the

this.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.770
#END_wanderer Creature like a
human just standing, looking

75ce53ec-0282-4108-8e2b-f5e449030482-1
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:07.620
back at the little boat. This
creature ascends the steps. We

75ce53ec-0282-4108-8e2b-f5e449030482-2
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:12.152
can see the legs of someone
standing there, and then the

75ce53ec-0282-4108-8e2b-f5e449030482-3
00:28:12.152 --> 00:28:16.763

just the legs of the two

00:28:16.763 --> 00:28:18.990

pictures.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:44.940
Yeah. Oh, next we have a complex
scene.

819b767e-ed10-407d-8d19-ade85d79658c-0
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.400

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.155
{So this one is just on a
complex scene like what we were

doing last week. So like this
one you could describe in like 3

26be312e-f872-4a7f-9dd8-523d0095357f-2

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:48.879
#START_unfriendly_giants There
are a bunch of giants in this

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.720
The scene has you know.

92657490-62ff-4a94-823d-08e4c589f8dc-0
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.785
In the foreground we see a
giants playing. It looks like

92657490-62ff-4a94-823d-08e4c589f8dc-1
00:29:59.785 --> 00:30:00.980
they're playing.

d5e4544f-fe11-4fa7-a736-c4d3735ab944-0
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:08.438
Chess and so there are 12340
half a dozen sitting around the

d5e4544f-fe11-4fa7-a736-c4d3735ab944-1
00:30:08.438 --> 00:30:10.140
the chess board.

To the.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.230
They're either eating or
drinking or or have something up

3a21db7a-1371-4f1e-890a-1255fae9a2ec-1
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.370
to their mouths. A couple of
them, and there are some.

9fbb0e42-64ec-4dbc-8fe8-33a28ed8b366-0
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:36.476
Little people around them all
around in the foreground, there

9fbb0e42-64ec-4dbc-8fe8-33a28ed8b366-1
00:30:36.476 --> 00:30:41.722
are people to go left of the
guys playing checkerboards.

9fbb0e42-64ec-4dbc-8fe8-33a28ed8b366-2
00:30:41.722 --> 00:30:47.704
There are people to the right of
them, and there are people. And

9fbb0e42-64ec-4dbc-8fe8-33a28ed8b366-3
00:30:47.704 --> 00:30:53.410
in front of or to our right of
the guys who have things up to

9fbb0e42-64ec-4dbc-8fe8-33a28ed8b366-4
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:59.209
their mouths, in the middle part
of the page we see a a female

9fbb0e42-64ec-4dbc-8fe8-33a28ed8b366-5
00:30:59.209 --> 00:31:01.050
giant, a male giant.

8fb23237-704e-4237-a46f-12c1ed2678f0-0
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.853
Now, walking toward her, just
greeting one another in the

8fb23237-704e-4237-a46f-12c1ed2678f0-1
00:31:05.853 --> 00:31:09.770
middle. It looks like there's a
house and that.

aeab2b3e-d1a1-4b77-ae8c-83aebe2dda59-0
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.674
There is a a giant approaching
this house where little people

aeab2b3e-d1a1-4b77-ae8c-83aebe2dda59-1
00:31:17.674 --> 00:31:18.190
live.

b16affbb-2adf-474a-9188-e5fad65dc39a-0
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:25.880
And to to its right is another
giant with the wearing a hat,

b16affbb-2adf-474a-9188-e5fad65dc39a-1
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:32.450
blonde hair, beard and he's got
a rope around the house.

f1c7cf62-405d-45ff-a8ed-c37d2e0aba9b-0
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.280
So like a noose around the
house.

fad6f383-d32e-4f50-a0da-f86178e06c49-0
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:44.353
And to his right is a a giant
looks like he's sitting in the

fad6f383-d32e-4f50-a0da-f86178e06c49-1
00:31:44.353 --> 00:31:50.747
trees, blue hat, blue shirt, and
tipping his hat to someone, no

fad6f383-d32e-4f50-a0da-f86178e06c49-2
00:31:50.747 --> 00:31:57.041
one in particular. And again, to
the right we see a male giant

fad6f383-d32e-4f50-a0da-f86178e06c49-3
00:31:57.041 --> 00:32:03.334
with a big mustache and yellow
vest handing a tree that's sort

fad6f383-d32e-4f50-a0da-f86178e06c49-4
00:32:03.334 --> 00:32:08.129
of like as a bouquet to a female
giant. Who is.

823a5700-121b-4fe3-9c97-8b4862b45119-0
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:08.620
Yeah.

1be556cf-375d-474a-859c-7de2447325e4-0
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:15.898
Wait, waving with her right hand
in the air, and she's wearing a

1be556cf-375d-474a-859c-7de2447325e4-1
00:32:15.898 --> 00:32:18.750
blue dress and a yellow top.

499054d3-8a0a-4dd5-ac82-1d72df3433a9-0
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:36.467
the giants. It looks like in the
middle there who are behind some

499054d3-8a0a-4dd5-ac82-1d72df3433a9-1
00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:42.105
trees and we see a castle. Looks
like Giants are three or four of

499054d3-8a0a-4dd5-ac82-1d72df3433a9-2
00:32:42.105 --> 00:32:46.119
them are walking toward this
castle. And then.

74e616b7-d0d4-4e62-b6ac-4e6eb12a76ed-0
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.770
We see a few who were.

8bc36ac3-476a-45eb-a2fb-066c8466f93d-0
00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:55.464
In the foreground of those who
just are just sort of standing

8bc36ac3-476a-45eb-a2fb-066c8466f93d-1
00:32:55.464 --> 00:33:00.437
and and walking, and in the
upper right hand of that page we

8bc36ac3-476a-45eb-a2fb-066c8466f93d-2
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:01.660
see a windmill.

fe1ae05e-37b4-459d-9fb3-e87553d0566e-0
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.551
#END_unfriendly_giants We see
one distinctly and then one in

fe1ae05e-37b4-459d-9fb3-e87553d0566e-1
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:12.292
the distance, and the Giants are
taller than the windmill, so one

fe1ae05e-37b4-459d-9fb3-e87553d0566e-2
00:33:12.292 --> 00:33:15.740
is standing next to the windmill
looking at it.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.560

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.640
#START_waldo-1 OK, so in this we
see a small town.

c94e85a3-bfa1-45db-b28e-add98607769e-0
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:35.170
In the middle of the town is a
fountain with A and a triangle.

0f8a4902-a4ec-4b2c-8f51-9dbb3f507c39-0
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:39.410
Out.

dda6211b-0642-4a0f-8443-ab14b59647f0-0
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.170
It's somewhat modern.

7b5b2273-eadc-46cc-b518-85fac28631cd-0
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:50.890
Town. The cars are like a little
Fiat or.

1fa8dea9-3950-4d4c-a148-a0380ef69e97-0
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:59.605
MG A Volkswagen bug we see some
sedans pickup trucks all right

1fa8dea9-3950-4d4c-a148-a0380ef69e97-1
00:34:59.605 --> 00:35:06.381
so the all the streets are are
white and we see a a variety of

1fa8dea9-3950-4d4c-a148-a0380ef69e97-2
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:13.157
colors of buildings. They're all
about two-story buildings. We

1fa8dea9-3950-4d4c-a148-a0380ef69e97-3
00:35:13.157 --> 00:35:18.320
see. Looks like a Firehouse, a
couple of shops.

992b9198-2c19-4d18-91cb-117ffc703d6b-0
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.130
Around the the town.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.010
And we see one here in the
foreground.

a7ea48ad-4f58-417d-81a5-b8d1bf016006-0
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.664
Let's see a building where the
people on the roof we see must

a7ea48ad-4f58-417d-81a5-b8d1bf016006-1
00:35:36.664 --> 00:35:41.526
be an apartment building. We see
people in the windows and the

a7ea48ad-4f58-417d-81a5-b8d1bf016006-2
00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:46.311
2nd floor. There's a man walking
into it. So it must be their

a7ea48ad-4f58-417d-81a5-b8d1bf016006-3
00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:51.250
apartment building or or maybe a
business on the bottom and the

a7ea48ad-4f58-417d-81a5-b8d1bf016006-4
00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.260

number of.

tents up with the red and white

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:15.588
And then we see what else we see
here and we see a lot of people

ebe2470c-1043-49ce-8c57-157e8d265af5-1
00:36:15.588 --> 00:36:19.530

crossing guard in the middle of

00:36:25.909 --> 00:36:31.424

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:38.670
Behind that, it looks like
they're going into a a a school,

3b15a74b-1a9c-45aa-a03e-d9ed42193f60-1
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.550
a school building there.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:46.050
It's it's got a fence around it.
What else do we see?

00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:00.570
#START_make_a_splash OK, this is
some type of water park with

9d3428be-329e-4fc2-9586-189983e17171-1
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.550
many slides.

816c3bd7-da28-4904-8383-101aa66aaaa3-0
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.970
Flowing down into the water.

09de02ac-6946-4e77-9beb-a5bba477acf4-0
00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:12.188
And it's very crowded. There are
people waiting to get on the

09de02ac-6946-4e77-9beb-a5bba477acf4-1
00:38:12.188 --> 00:38:18.126
slides, on the left side, on the
in the middle, on the right. And

09de02ac-6946-4e77-9beb-a5bba477acf4-2
00:38:18.126 --> 00:38:23.884
there are a lot of people of all
kinds of races standing in the

09de02ac-6946-4e77-9beb-a5bba477acf4-3
00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:28.922
middle in the water. They're
either, you know, swimming

09de02ac-6946-4e77-9beb-a5bba477acf4-4
00:38:28.922 --> 00:38:34.140
around a little bit or just
standing there talking. So my

09de02ac-6946-4e77-9beb-a5bba477acf4-5
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.660
guess is it's not very deep.

ab856d9e-1525-4e3c-8fd7-a3cf05820ba0-0
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:42.254
And there's a looks like a
pirate ship in the upper right

ab856d9e-1525-4e3c-8fd7-a3cf05820ba0-1
00:38:42.254 --> 00:38:47.875
hand corner, where kids are
climbing on rope ladders having

ab856d9e-1525-4e3c-8fd7-a3cf05820ba0-2
00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:51.530
fun, and in the foreground there
is a.

cf7187a6-6ce6-463c-913a-b1fbe22bfc77-0
00:38:54.270 --> 00:39:00.167
There are a number of people in
the water and then some kind of

cf7187a6-6ce6-463c-913a-b1fbe22bfc77-1
00:39:00.167 --> 00:39:02.840
sea creatures. Maybe they're.

790125db-fc7a-416d-a2f5-2b91ec69bd35-0
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:11.506
Real. Maybe they're manufactured
that are. One is looks like a

790125db-fc7a-416d-a2f5-2b91ec69bd35-1
00:39:11.506 --> 00:39:17.274
giant frogs head, the other two
look like big. Maybe they're

790125db-fc7a-416d-a2f5-2b91ec69bd35-2
00:39:17.274 --> 00:39:19.260
beach balls that are.

c97b1f03-d968-4162-ba63-40fdb5e29f66-0
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:28.175
Gigantic red and white polka
dots on them and then we see a

c97b1f03-d968-4162-ba63-40fdb5e29f66-1
00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:30.620
little walkway that.

91a24123-4ffb-4326-96e9-9b89e52d03f9-0
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:54.244
Like laying in the water,
sunning themselves, or just

91a24123-4ffb-4326-96e9-9b89e52d03f9-1
00:39:54.244 --> 00:39:57.920
enjoying the water and then we
see an elephant.

a5458f1e-6fb1-419f-afac-20eaf22f3b27-0
00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:06.561

in the pool.

All right.}

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.024
#START_dinosaurs_spacemen_and_ghouls
The right side of this, there's

3a93007a-8f11-4532-8152-108d20a95bfd-1
00:41:01.024 --> 00:41:01.110
a.

ca3b9618-86f6-442f-8d29-c0cbf7eb62fe-0
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:10.613
Structure that's holding up a
large mural or painting, and on

ca3b9618-86f6-442f-8d29-c0cbf7eb62fe-1
00:41:10.613 --> 00:41:17.430
it it looks like there are space
age flying objects.

36de81ef-5cbd-4a2f-a62f-2de31d2c262e-0
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:24.750
And some type of rocket ship
that's on the ground.

df124fb4-5b9c-4dbb-b755-3da09480c6c0-0
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:31.415
And there are people who are up
on the girders, and it looks

df124fb4-5b9c-4dbb-b755-3da09480c6c0-1
00:41:31.415 --> 00:41:32.440
like they're.

3a865604-1a24-493c-b738-12389108cd11-0
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.825
Controlling merriness. And so
they have ropes coming down to

3a865604-1a24-493c-b738-12389108cd11-1
00:41:38.825 --> 00:41:43.165
these creatures. Or maybe
they're people who, who knows?

3a865604-1a24-493c-b738-12389108cd11-2
00:41:43.165 --> 00:41:45.450
Or maybe it's people climbing.

716b203d-db3b-4bfc-8b88-8cd619db4ece-0
00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:47.420
Up.

6e9224ce-f53d-411b-a6c5-41986198c101-0
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:54.808
It's it's hard to tell. So and
then to the left of that is a

6e9224ce-f53d-411b-a6c5-41986198c101-1
00:41:54.808 --> 00:42:00.468
volcano and on top of the
volcano we see water or some

6e9224ce-f53d-411b-a6c5-41986198c101-2
00:42:00.468 --> 00:42:06.746
liquid coming out and there are
a couple of men up on top of

6e9224ce-f53d-411b-a6c5-41986198c101-3
00:42:06.746 --> 00:42:13.230
that being bounced around by the
the, the, the, the liquid and

6e9224ce-f53d-411b-a6c5-41986198c101-4
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.980
there are people.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:21.290
Who are on the side of the
volcano with their arms

78cd7058-f57f-40f0-a3de-9ee0b1f30d45-1
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:22.210
extended.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:30.810
We see a dinosaur and upper left
hand corner we see a dinosaur's

899c36ed-6bc0-44c6-888a-c786f98d02e2-1
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:36.620
head and we see a dinosaur like
a blue Aqua colored dinosaur.

efa96fe6-e4a7-429a-9143-95bf0dbf8e4c-0
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:43.868
Below the the mountain, the
Volcanic volcanic mountain, we

efa96fe6-e4a7-429a-9143-95bf0dbf8e4c-1
00:42:43.868 --> 00:42:45.570
see several other.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:51.810
Dinosaur creatures milling about
in the foreground there.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:43:00.273
Of different colors and then in
the foreground on both sides we

00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:00.740

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:08.949
There are. There's a little
building with three doors in it,

a9497536-31e8-45b9-b2fb-21cdac564e10-1
00:43:08.949 --> 00:43:14.294
and the star on top looks like
it looks like maybe a restroom

a9497536-31e8-45b9-b2fb-21cdac564e10-2
00:43:14.294 --> 00:43:15.760
or dressing room.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:28.605
A blue wall with lights on it so
it looks like they're spotlights

77420271-b0a0-4a0c-a4c6-a11027f5b74c-1
00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:35.522
shining on something in the very
middle of that looks like a a

77420271-b0a0-4a0c-a4c6-a11027f5b74c-2
00:43:35.522 --> 00:43:41.999
giant Dairy Queen cone, and to
the right there's a yellow.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.100
They're crowding.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:57.293
looks. It looks like people
coming in or or maybe it's a

867b5cf5-ba32-4b36-ba3b-367b7df6af5e-1
00:43:57.293 --> 00:44:02.911
deli or something where food is
being sold. Either Butcher shop

867b5cf5-ba32-4b36-ba3b-367b7df6af5e-2
00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:03.350

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:40.103
I don't know if the bridge would
be for cars or pedestrians and

bc27f42a-aee7-4db7-bda5-cb561029d6be-1
00:45:40.103 --> 00:45:40.750

Left side of the scene is on
lamppost with a a little park

00:45:47.203 --> 00:45:50.210
bench in it and then a little
tramp.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:00.317
Bridge from the left there is a
a statue of a, a winged

3458de2d-ec96-497a-be26-6bcd7a1d0653-1
00:46:00.317 --> 00:46:06.350

this creature has its.

Right leg elevated on a rock and
it's right arm.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:23.617
Pointing toward the sky, it's
left leg, toward the back, it's

527a9192-6a97-4f78-8fe5-28ea21526064-1
00:46:23.617 --> 00:46:32.130
left arm down underneath the the
arc Arc bridge we see a couple

527a9192-6a97-4f78-8fe5-28ea21526064-2
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:32.530

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:39.125
uh children who are looks like
they're trying to stay out of

00e8dda6-99ea-4b91-99aa-05d069d8de02-1
00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:43.910
the rain. It's rain, rainy, and
you can see raindrops.

c7c515da-44be-4364-94b5-abf7800af2ec-0
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:50.074

00:46:50.074 --> 00:46:55.076
the bridge, there's a there's
another type of figure statue

c7c515da-44be-4364-94b5-abf7800af2ec-2

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.680
And then beyond that, a couple
of light posts underneath the

ed00a679-2f66-44e2-8064-8b0e6d86310a-1
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.891
bridge where the children are
standing. There's this set of

00:47:05.891 --> 00:47:09.049
doors so that maybe a
maintenance storage or

ed00a679-2f66-44e2-8064-8b0e6d86310a-3
00:47:09.049 --> 00:47:13.189
something, but it's just a set
of doors, OK? And there are

ed00a679-2f66-44e2-8064-8b0e6d86310a-4
00:47:13.189 --> 00:47:17.470
bicycle and there's a couple
bicycles. So it looks like they

ed00a679-2f66-44e2-8064-8b0e6d86310a-5
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:21.190
they were riding bicycles to

Ah, OK, and out of the doors
comes a.

77c675b6-1b29-4514-8ceb-b69b95e95fc6-0
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.410
A man dressed in red robes and a
red.

86619e66-e8fc-4a9a-b2cf-cc5a3a91ebc4-0
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:45.203
Hat looks like a beanie, and
he's got a long white hair and a

86619e66-e8fc-4a9a-b2cf-cc5a3a91ebc4-1
00:47:45.203 --> 00:47:51.390
long white beard. The doors are
sort of a bizantine or oriental

86619e66-e8fc-4a9a-b2cf-cc5a3a91ebc4-2
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:57.286
doors, and he's got a piece of
paper in his in his left hand

86619e66-e8fc-4a9a-b2cf-cc5a3a91ebc4-3
00:47:57.286 --> 00:48:03.086
and he's got his finger up to
his lips as if trying to have

86619e66-e8fc-4a9a-b2cf-cc5a3a91ebc4-4
00:48:03.086 --> 00:48:05.600
the children to be silent.

a088de9a-cd2c-4645-9150-ca53b20ed5e0-0
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:13.094
And the the girl. Now we can see
more clearly. The girl is laying

a088de9a-cd2c-4645-9150-ca53b20ed5e0-1
00:48:13.094 --> 00:48:13.560
on a.

b43eef7b-bf96-4166-ac21-4b2a76f15065-0
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:19.031
A blanket and the boy is
standing, and they're both

b43eef7b-bf96-4166-ac21-4b2a76f15065-1
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:24.929
surprised to see this man come
through the door, and above them

b43eef7b-bf96-4166-ac21-4b2a76f15065-2
00:48:24.929 --> 00:48:25.390
is a.

3c4bc601-3e44-4841-8e90-507dec535a0b-0
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:31.975
A winged creature that's like a
bluish color it's got. It has

3c4bc601-3e44-4841-8e90-507dec535a0b-1
00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:33.280
the body of a.

75fabeac-5288-42cf-91b1-1a39a16f541a-0
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:40.080
A fish and wings and a long tail
with the three.

f02b16cb-c03b-4cb4-9602-2f98d55ba507-0
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:41.400
Umm.

14fedb82-63de-4111-9c4f-e94af2f01f11-0
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:49.779
Three sort of like spikes on the
end of the tail. So the next

14fedb82-63de-4111-9c4f-e94af2f01f11-1
00:48:49.779 --> 00:48:54.140
picture shows the the the man
pointing.

57d3ee51-b3bc-40a9-a704-0ae26636673d-0
00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.100
He has handed the paper to the
boy and he's pointing to it.

41e9d92e-1b9b-4eee-92a9-945de0cf29cc-0
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.953
And the creature, the wing, the
flying creature has perched

41e9d92e-1b9b-4eee-92a9-945de0cf29cc-1
00:49:06.953 --> 00:49:13.288
itself on his left shoulder as
he's reading this, and the girl

41e9d92e-1b9b-4eee-92a9-945de0cf29cc-2
00:49:13.288 --> 00:49:13.590
is.

f46bad37-8c40-4c47-9e40-4627474da075-0
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.810
 standing.

4bda3844-7e3d-4329-9ee0-63644ec661ef-0
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.970
Fall down on his back and
something is that was in his.

6ca9d34c-40fc-415e-a0f0-6fbdbc54bea8-0
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.640
Left hand comes flying out of
his hand. The little girl is has

6ca9d34c-40fc-415e-a0f0-6fbdbc54bea8-1
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:54.068
fallen backwards and the boy is
dropped his arms and the

6ca9d34c-40fc-415e-a0f0-6fbdbc54bea8-2
00:49:54.068 --> 00:49:58.449
creatures flown off his
shoulder. Then these.

225448d3-4b69-489b-9581-dbb9da087903-0
00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.160
Two guards who have.

cf84a670-4f2a-45fc-9a4b-c188f8c5189d-0
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:12.726
They take the man away and back
into the doors, and the children

cf84a670-4f2a-45fc-9a4b-c188f8c5189d-1
00:50:12.726 --> 00:50:13.190
are.

b8597cd4-8c8b-446b-9201-52c8d45ae86b-0
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.500
Now Crouched down and.

f028243b-0ebf-4add-888e-9fec0385c4c5-0
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:25.600
Creature has reperched itself on
the boys left shoulder.

8754d553-7dae-4ef3-bff3-594956fe760d-0
00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.120
OK, the door is closed and.

22daf07c-d9e7-4c82-9561-b65498c349da-0
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:52.229
Boy standing on the right, the
girl standing on the left. He

22daf07c-d9e7-4c82-9561-b65498c349da-1
00:50:52.229 --> 00:50:57.463
has the the scroll and his right
hand, and he has this little

22daf07c-d9e7-4c82-9561-b65498c349da-2
00:50:57.463 --> 00:51:00.079
blue cylinder in his left hand.

95d3ef1e-0f5a-470a-9e65-b877849aff9e-0
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:08.567
And then the next picture of the
I'll call it the bird. The bird

95d3ef1e-0f5a-470a-9e65-b877849aff9e-1
00:51:08.567 --> 00:51:12.370
is flying above the children,
but the girl.

5403ba86-53b8-4f60-a100-6a94a7c58d44-0
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.450
And the.

42fda606-e7c4-47af-9564-a7c7f927d1ae-0
00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:31.690
Boy is on the ground. It looks
like he's also drawing a key, so

42fda606-e7c4-47af-9564-a7c7f927d1ae-1
00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.860
they both have keys drawn and
they're.

0d5c9c23-c8bc-4609-abd5-12a85030b646-0
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:41.758
Holding their hands up, facing
each other, holding the keys up

0d5c9c23-c8bc-4609-abd5-12a85030b646-1
00:51:41.758 --> 00:51:44.390
to each other, and the bird is.

98e07922-0bca-42eb-9351-cfa636df8cd7-0
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:51.435
On the ground looking up at
them. So they opened the doors

98e07922-0bca-42eb-9351-cfa636df8cd7-1
00:51:51.435 --> 00:51:57.244
and they enter the the doors and
the bird is flying above them,

98e07922-0bca-42eb-9351-cfa636df8cd7-2
00:51:57.244 --> 00:52:00.330
about to enter the doors as
well.

a2c5aca2-83ac-476c-9033-b69ec4f31718-0
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.160


bcf150bf-03d0-4a39-978b-d1bb73c6913a-0
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.870
OK, let's see. Where did they
go?

1fda97ea-3243-461f-bf2c-b96856df4165-0
00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:32.345
Well, in this picture we see a a
Moat and to the left of the

1fda97ea-3243-461f-bf2c-b96856df4165-1
00:52:32.345 --> 00:52:32.940
Moat.

d1978cb2-d1c3-4434-a57a-3e54734b7f57-0
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:41.482
We see the children emerging. It
looks like they're coming out of

d1978cb2-d1c3-4434-a57a-3e54734b7f57-1
00:52:41.482 --> 00:52:41.670
a.

5f089cca-4dec-41ae-abb8-30be74c38d98-0
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:46.091
Or they're they're on the left
hand side. I don't know they

5f089cca-4dec-41ae-abb8-30be74c38d98-1
00:52:46.091 --> 00:52:47.220
were. This is the.

90e3cd58-6dac-4f6c-adc6-8550519b246a-0
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:55.774
Where the door leads anyway,
they're now inside. This looks

90e3cd58-6dac-4f6c-adc6-8550519b246a-1
00:52:55.774 --> 00:53:02.549
like Castle Moat. There are a
couple of devices of flying in

90e3cd58-6dac-4f6c-adc6-8550519b246a-2
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:09.546
the air above them, and there's
a large castle across the Moat

90e3cd58-6dac-4f6c-adc6-8550519b246a-3
00:53:09.546 --> 00:53:11.990
from them, and we see.

f5bec69c-e73d-4f9b-9a74-0175cf0777eb-0
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:18.714
On a like a drop it's, it's it's
like an arc and it looks like a

f5bec69c-e73d-4f9b-9a74-0175cf0777eb-1
00:53:18.714 --> 00:53:19.550
a boat has.

55cd2411-68b6-4223-aed0-0288b670debd-0
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.830
Entered the Ark and the man who
came out to see.

281cdad9-1bcb-4747-872a-e772987c5deb-0
00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.487
Number of people in the boat,
perhaps they're they're the

281cdad9-1bcb-4747-872a-e772987c5deb-1
00:53:38.487 --> 00:53:38.870
rowers.

177c5b57-10b6-413b-a27e-e8f0c2c776b0-0
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.670
All right, so the.

9feb435b-60d8-4d1a-a813-00be37223caa-0
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.408
The the boy and the girl are in
the foreground. They're looking

9feb435b-60d8-4d1a-a813-00be37223caa-1
00:53:53.408 --> 00:53:57.878
at this paper that the man
handed them, and they're they're

9feb435b-60d8-4d1a-a813-00be37223caa-2
00:53:57.878 --> 00:54:00.560
reading it, so they're on a
little.

bfeafc07-f653-487d-a15b-ad05a0d8792a-0
00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:02.830
Umm.

d3603d6d-3ecf-4172-87f4-8b8c2a32ba86-0
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.990
Little Rock.

b2c227a3-4f74-48c9-a777-e3b2c74f5b3a-0
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.140
Formation.

a6e7fb29-979e-4f29-aede-2710d1dc538e-0
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:13.730
With the the city, the castle in
the background. Now we see a

a6e7fb29-979e-4f29-aede-2710d1dc538e-1
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:19.231
bridge above that, and on the
bridge it looks like a canal

a6e7fb29-979e-4f29-aede-2710d1dc538e-2
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:24.080
because there are boats on top
of it and there are.

4b4a9906-6b9c-4f16-a7a5-63127ea80fa7-0
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.794
Buildings to the left that have
like Byzantine tops and and we

4b4a9906-6b9c-4f16-a7a5-63127ea80fa7-1
00:54:30.794 --> 00:54:35.629
see a fire and smoke coming out
of them, and the boat on which

4b4a9906-6b9c-4f16-a7a5-63127ea80fa7-2
00:54:35.629 --> 00:54:39.926
the man was taken is in the
background and it's getting

4b4a9906-6b9c-4f16-a7a5-63127ea80fa7-3
00:54:39.926 --> 00:54:44.915
further away from them. We find
out that what they're looking at

4b4a9906-6b9c-4f16-a7a5-63127ea80fa7-4
00:54:44.915 --> 00:54:46.450
is some kind of map.

4f3b21df-f251-42ee-b68e-c7ac5bb57e5d-0
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.600
And they're with the.

1b33d218-1206-41ce-bfb0-20331367efd6-0
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.500
6.

191b862c-13b9-427f-a566-26a2c04ec6c1-0
00:54:53.690 --> 00:55:00.294
In the middle of the map it
looks like an island with some

191b862c-13b9-427f-a566-26a2c04ec6c1-1
00:55:00.294 --> 00:55:06.340
water and then some peninsulas
around the the island.

41177549-8421-46e4-872f-eb14561ee728-0
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:12.157
And then there are two. There
are some circles drawn on that

41177549-8421-46e4-872f-eb14561ee728-1
00:55:12.157 --> 00:55:17.240
start with blue and blue and
red, and then the circles. The

41177549-8421-46e4-872f-eb14561ee728-2
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.849
arcs have become a.

31a8ee74-f4f5-4564-9ddf-0b7a54d19a7e-0
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.700
5:00 o'clock and A and a.

187c60f7-e533-4a95-bbe4-1670d0da9521-0
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:34.800
Clockwise motion and then inside
the circles we see a.

0003b18b-1727-4651-a2f9-808a7707d7a4-0
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:40.141
It looks like a tree trunk with
a door cut at the bottom and

0003b18b-1727-4651-a2f9-808a7707d7a4-1
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:44.100
then the city that they're in
and then it looks like.

97043dfe-9a72-4694-afa0-c54fdca34c05-0
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:52.903
Looks like an old Greek temple
and then a another type of

97043dfe-9a72-4694-afa0-c54fdca34c05-1
00:55:52.903 --> 00:55:57.670
skyscraper. Then, then the last
and the.

538cc291-f6d3-4ce4-85fe-e4492336a5b8-0
00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:00.080
5th one we see.

ea538c68-238f-4771-b6bf-1a7be6223fc2-0
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:06.378
A little mountain like ice,
capped mountains like the the

ea538c68-238f-4771-b6bf-1a7be6223fc2-1
00:56:06.378 --> 00:56:09.760
Alps, and then finally a palm
tree.

57006d47-3b41-4280-ab1e-99ca8543f5d0-0
00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:19.486
All right, here they're looking
at the map and the the bird is

57006d47-3b41-4280-ab1e-99ca8543f5d0-1
00:56:19.486 --> 00:56:23.770
flying in the foreground to the
right and on the.

1e15eb48-e237-4856-bc4c-a3aa58e2e293-0
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.150
On the canal we see that there
are some boats.

d92a7096-0845-4d47-b931-ce9a9a31ae16-0
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:35.870
Making their way toward them,
these look like the the gondolas

d92a7096-0845-4d47-b931-ce9a9a31ae16-1
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:40.351
that they find and in Venice. So
the gondolas are making their

d92a7096-0845-4d47-b931-ce9a9a31ae16-2
00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:43.410
way toward the the children, the
children.

f9428783-4627-4eb8-8832-3af93187b595-0
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.960
Face each other and they.

1eae4c81-68f1-49fb-8089-50c05e5e4c5e-0
00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.448
Sort of like fist bump, but
they're holding something in

1eae4c81-68f1-49fb-8089-50c05e5e4c5e-1
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:51.010
their hands.

402161d0-14b1-4ff4-acea-48da532725d5-0
00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.390
The girl has a.

81dc7525-e985-48c5-bead-6bb2800819b9-0
00:56:56.290 --> 00:57:02.470
She draws a device like a helmet
that they would deep sea diver

81dc7525-e985-48c5-bead-6bb2800819b9-1
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.560
would wear, and then the boy is.

d20adc38-a70a-432b-8dbd-2bd7471f16f9-0
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:13.551
Touching a an octopus of some
sort and then they dive into the

d20adc38-a70a-432b-8dbd-2bd7471f16f9-1
00:57:13.551 --> 00:57:15.990
water along with the birds.

484016f1-821d-4e8e-bb7f-8ccc5f927f92-0
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:17.850
Month.

8585d351-44b3-425b-a453-6abfd5649d88-0
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.670
All right.

65a4384a-adb4-4bbb-9b48-56f00dcf1754-0
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:27.700
Some.

503d65e5-db1b-4d3e-9251-b746c25b964e-0
00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:48.694
Old Roman or or Greek building
with columns on it. There's no

503d65e5-db1b-4d3e-9251-b746c25b964e-1
00:57:48.694 --> 00:57:55.243
there's no roof to it and it's
surrounded, it looks like by a a

503d65e5-db1b-4d3e-9251-b746c25b964e-2
00:57:55.243 --> 00:58:00.872
walled city, something
resembling the the Coliseum and

503d65e5-db1b-4d3e-9251-b746c25b964e-3
00:58:00.872 --> 00:58:07.012
then it has a couple of sky or
sky towers around the around

503d65e5-db1b-4d3e-9251-b746c25b964e-4
00:58:07.012 --> 00:58:08.240
this temple.

39b2a4b6-aee6-496d-98d9-cfd400949abf-0
00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:20.770
They are now inside the temple
and they're looking at.

7a6d0f17-1292-4613-8664-7547d114b0cb-0
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:28.592
Little table structure that's
made of sea horses and a shell

7a6d0f17-1292-4613-8664-7547d114b0cb-1
00:58:28.592 --> 00:58:34.882
and they're there's something on
it. So they're both wearing deep

7a6d0f17-1292-4613-8664-7547d114b0cb-2
00:58:34.882 --> 00:58:40.695
sea diving helmets as they're
exploring this. They also have

7a6d0f17-1292-4613-8664-7547d114b0cb-3
00:58:40.695 --> 00:58:42.220
fins on and the.

4d013486-1d8b-4cd2-b8b4-10d1c1772867-0
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.870
Picture they start to swim away.

a6ad2997-5471-4008-b59c-f880b22a8476-0
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:57.320
Because it looks like they're
being chased by.

b552d6c5-4a0d-4955-966a-b94dc13fb5a8-0
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:05.610
Underwater creatures who have
Spears and are swimming towards

b552d6c5-4a0d-4955-966a-b94dc13fb5a8-1
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:06.140
them.

61834b73-fbd6-4732-9ebf-f5b6255776aa-0
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.960
And the next picture, they
emerge from the water and they

61834b73-fbd6-4732-9ebf-f5b6255776aa-1
00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:27.372
are on a an island and it's
filled with palm trees and the

61834b73-fbd6-4732-9ebf-f5b6255776aa-2
00:59:27.372 --> 00:59:31.500
bird is above them and here
they're drawing.

0eafeed9-c063-4110-8768-7d379a1323f4-0
00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.010
The girl is on top. She's on top
of a.

ff3f1aef-294a-49d7-81a9-338892cf85ba-0
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:42.912
Art that they drew. And so
they're they're drawing

ff3f1aef-294a-49d7-81a9-338892cf85ba-1
00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:47.175
something that looks like the
shape of a rhinoceros at this

ff3f1aef-294a-49d7-81a9-338892cf85ba-2
00:59:47.175 --> 00:59:51.579
point, and the bird is perched
on the boys right shoulder and

ff3f1aef-294a-49d7-81a9-338892cf85ba-3
00:59:51.579 --> 00:59:55.700
in his right arm hand is
grasping the map that they have.

fd9f6327-13ee-4364-afa5-cc6699407218-0
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.410
All right, all right. So they've
made some type of dinosaur.

53ec7cdc-ea9e-4fc8-b8df-d824ebc55c02-0
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:16.452
And the dinosaur is headed looks
like some ancient ruins, like

53ec7cdc-ea9e-4fc8-b8df-d824ebc55c02-1
01:00:16.452 --> 01:00:22.925
Mayan or ruins, Inca ruins, and
in Mexico or South America and

53ec7cdc-ea9e-4fc8-b8df-d824ebc55c02-2
01:00:22.925 --> 01:00:26.110
they're approaching a like a 2.

b86235be-f459-4847-a8f3-a8aa1f1f6c4f-0
01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:33.541
Statues that act as an entryway
to the to this village, to these

b86235be-f459-4847-a8f3-a8aa1f1f6c4f-1
01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:34.100
ruins.

535c9fa3-f5b7-4fde-81de-9410f1940a96-0
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.373
And in the background we see in
the water there emerges a small

535c9fa3-f5b7-4fde-81de-9410f1940a96-1
01:00:41.373 --> 01:00:47.372
island with a a statue on top of
it and there are looks like

535c9fa3-f5b7-4fde-81de-9410f1940a96-2
01:00:47.372 --> 01:00:53.764
there are ropes that go from the
the ruins out to this structure

535c9fa3-f5b7-4fde-81de-9410f1940a96-3
01:00:53.764 --> 01:00:55.240
on this island.

88cf5972-4c0d-4780-a570-6bdda5029e22-0
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.210
OK, this is a closer.

0281f391-5ec7-428f-80f8-ad9845f96d07-0
01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:29.730
bridge 

dc7a4bfa-d0a8-4c81-8e29-827977ba655f-0
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:44.302
All right, now they find that
they are on top of the structure

dc7a4bfa-d0a8-4c81-8e29-827977ba655f-1
01:01:44.302 --> 01:01:49.982
and they're being now chased by
a couple of guards who are on

dc7a4bfa-d0a8-4c81-8e29-827977ba655f-2
01:01:49.982 --> 01:01:55.388
the footbridge and have come
across from the the land. The

dc7a4bfa-d0a8-4c81-8e29-827977ba655f-3
01:01:55.388 --> 01:01:59.419
boy and girl are now drawing.
He's drawing.

a6eb9e25-59d7-4237-8ecf-76b69b3a2f29-0
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:05.200
Things that look like giant
popsicle sticks.

df9aa4b8-8e9b-4eb0-975a-423d77044d16-0
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:11.910
And she is drawing a little
looks like a little 2 by 6.

0edacedc-1717-4326-a341-3e9e103eefd6-0
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:22.642
And what they've done is they've
made, they've they've made

0edacedc-1717-4326-a341-3e9e103eefd6-1
01:02:22.642 --> 01:02:24.280
themselves a swing.

86474416-560d-4d09-a86c-760330c17070-0
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:30.350
And the swing is attached to the
feet of a.

bb06d824-3d77-4612-ab66-2549b4cfe4fe-0
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:33.820
A giant.

b05ae67e-10ca-45fc-b302-fd24934c453c-0
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.450
Let's see. What do you call
those

4e97594a-7717-4331-8181-d97671584ac7-0
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:43.251
Like a dragonfly. And so the
dragonfly is pulling them to

4e97594a-7717-4331-8181-d97671584ac7-1
01:02:43.251 --> 01:02:47.880
safety. And the the the there
are some guards who are trying

4e97594a-7717-4331-8181-d97671584ac7-2
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.585
to get hold of them. They're
grasping for their feet, but the

4e97594a-7717-4331-8181-d97671584ac7-3
01:02:52.585 --> 01:02:56.834
children looks like they've
escaped, and they're flying

4e97594a-7717-4331-8181-d97671584ac7-4
01:02:56.834 --> 01:02:58.580
toward the, toward the.

d26f6518-668c-46ae-ac74-e1e6135d752a-0
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.400
One of the Rocky, Snowy
Mountains.

15b374b5-f2f9-46c3-bd14-9e62bc3c8667-0
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:19.058
All right, so now they've
arrived to a what looks like a

15b374b5-f2f9-46c3-bd14-9e62bc3c8667-1
01:03:19.058 --> 01:03:25.031
Buddhist temple, and there's a
Buddhist statue at the bottom of

15b374b5-f2f9-46c3-bd14-9e62bc3c8667-2
01:03:25.031 --> 01:03:30.910
this temple. It it looks so, it
must be like in the Himalayas.

77713479-86fd-4454-a5cf-66a4bbcff6ff-0
01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:32.430
And.

90af724d-1dac-4b1f-9ea8-9d31a1e774f6-0
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.340
And so they take.

86966954-d0fc-408f-b66a-043dfcfdc6b9-0
01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:43.230
Looks like a.

967cd33a-2384-4d62-a6fc-42e0085d8142-0
01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.890
The girl has a.

f41d6318-72fe-4483-b1c0-81bdf5be11fc-0
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.963
Like a belt with various looks,
like curler objects attached to

f41d6318-72fe-4483-b1c0-81bdf5be11fc-1
01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:59.220
it, a different colors and
they're standing on top of this

f41d6318-72fe-4483-b1c0-81bdf5be11fc-2
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.300
roof looking at this and the
bird is hovering over them.

cf29a688-a4fc-4061-93e7-1fe4a755e4cd-0
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:15.246
All right. So now in this,
they're being pursued by people

cf29a688-a4fc-4061-93e7-1fe4a755e4cd-1
01:04:15.246 --> 01:04:18.260
in helium or hydrogen balloons
that are.

18a025a3-683d-49cb-b024-d312ae39a501-0
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:24.070
Flying above them, and now
they're.

766be624-244e-436b-b72c-cbedfffe538d-0
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:29.615
They're trapped again. The bird
is in the middle and between

766be624-244e-436b-b72c-cbedfffe538d-1
01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:32.440
them, and then in the next scene
we see that.

bd5c9bcf-e606-4dd7-a385-aa51a079e49b-0
01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.420
That.

f1841343-c26f-4dce-b1de-dc8c99bcbdfa-0
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.920
There are three.

afa4315f-d7fa-4f9f-ace6-16b1f6e2b6ca-0
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.620
Perhaps hovering around in the
sky.

a867056e-21a9-48c9-a511-fe06ab0bdc21-0
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:51.220
All right. And this one.

215a1a92-ae91-441b-9c17-37bb60781489-0
01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.970
There are escapists.

582997b9-e7c3-4a5c-834f-2e8c338b0cc9-0
01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.588
Yeah, the the the piece of
material that the girl was

582997b9-e7c3-4a5c-834f-2e8c338b0cc9-1
01:05:00.588 --> 01:05:06.499
looking at is now has become a
rainbow and the bird is taking

582997b9-e7c3-4a5c-834f-2e8c338b0cc9-2
01:05:06.499 --> 01:05:12.506
the the belt and it's creating a
rainbow for the children. And

582997b9-e7c3-4a5c-834f-2e8c338b0cc9-3
01:05:12.506 --> 01:05:18.227
there are still being pursued by
people in balloons and now

582997b9-e7c3-4a5c-834f-2e8c338b0cc9-4
01:05:18.227 --> 01:05:20.420
there's somebody who's.

040877d7-ee58-42d8-b1b3-a673266404ca-0
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:25.150
There's some guards on the right
that are very close to them on

040877d7-ee58-42d8-b1b3-a673266404ca-1
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.890
some type of.

56e22810-39a3-4086-95ec-83bc60a27ce5-0
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.390
There their balloon is.

140a2fa5-8cd6-4fb9-b47a-71a0429f2e88-0
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.840
Vertical and so.

84ab7225-b5b9-4ea6-a131-21a1a735dbcf-0
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.670
They're trying to make their way
to to the children.

62c2f8fc-2fd1-46cb-ac28-7d02e8435ef5-0
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:44.560
So the.

cfed6233-5ea3-4400-884a-604a7d13e5fc-0
01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.030
Umm.

6b5ad526-c274-41f1-8bb5-77f161b93af6-0
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:56.085
The rainbow extends from where
the Buddhist statue was, down

6b5ad526-c274-41f1-8bb5-77f161b93af6-1
01:05:56.085 --> 01:06:00.180
into a body of water alongside
of.

69da3f30-0d70-4e23-b33b-c5ece6256772-0
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.630
Some.

425d7158-c8a5-4826-80fb-f6b1596cce40-0
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:07.960
Our bridge viaduct, maybe and.

baa6da3d-0283-4a22-b1d4-f3019c50edad-0
01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.131
In the background there we see
that there is a water that's

baa6da3d-0283-4a22-b1d4-f3019c50edad-1
01:06:13.131 --> 01:06:14.280
flowing from the.

c183c8bd-62f2-4b78-8101-1d77038b7698-0
01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:23.122
Another higher viaduct into the,
into the, into the water and

c183c8bd-62f2-4b78-8101-1d77038b7698-1
01:06:23.122 --> 01:06:23.610
the.

1daa8f9b-2990-415d-ade9-85eeb68cd192-0
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:30.930
Children have taken the rainbow
and and now they are.

7a2f72d4-8930-4c7d-a300-8f9ac8a34ca3-0
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:32.390
Uh.

b6e383ff-9e54-4c8a-b639-c50a5132990b-0
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.983
I guess they've escaped. And
they've escaped by way of the

b6e383ff-9e54-4c8a-b639-c50a5132990b-1
01:06:37.983 --> 01:06:41.790
rainbow. And at the end of the
rainbow is a is a boat.

d0005723-a049-45ab-9806-1daacf83899c-0
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:43.730
like.

79198dc1-3257-4b9f-9643-09bf16465a75-0
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:52.273
A paddle boat with a number of
people on it and the bird is

79198dc1-3257-4b9f-9643-09bf16465a75-1
01:06:52.273 --> 01:06:54.190
flying over them.

c991af80-f4b8-4f21-b792-d484ac5f82ee-0
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.070
OK, so now we see that the
little children are entering.

7aacc0ad-7b12-400c-8ef0-6dbf322a7135-0
01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.360
a City.

70d80692-3a44-40aa-bccd-21866c79e34e-0
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.090
On a rhinoceros.

3cb342a3-ee61-4b4a-bd20-1cad95fff71b-0
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:17.380
And the the riding on top of it.

5a72d0df-844f-47ef-8b72-3628336957b7-0
01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:23.480
Inside of a a little canopy and
they have a.

6aadf86e-78bf-4226-a40e-66e7c33ded0e-0
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:29.264
A driver or a guide who's
sitting in front of them and and

6aadf86e-78bf-4226-a40e-66e7c33ded0e-1
01:07:29.264 --> 01:07:32.930
so they're in this city that has
a Moat.

df89ded8-f12c-411d-be35-87eac6b10caa-0
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.270
In.

2d781f7e-f0f2-4173-bbf1-b224028638fe-0
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:42.472
Or another paddle boat and there
there isn't sort of like an

2d781f7e-f0f2-4173-bbf1-b224028638fe-1
01:07:42.472 --> 01:07:47.159
entourage behind them and in the
in the background we see all

2d781f7e-f0f2-4173-bbf1-b224028638fe-2
01:07:47.159 --> 01:07:50.940
kinds of towers and looks like a
bell towers and.

fc4ec56d-4a5c-49fa-89ad-8dbe470be884-0
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.230
Big cupolas from churches and so
on.

9ec6a8d1-424e-4a2d-82de-20f67ae39547-0
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:12.308
OK. And now they have they're,
they're getting off the

9ec6a8d1-424e-4a2d-82de-20f67ae39547-1
01:08:12.308 --> 01:08:16.270
rhinoceros and there's the man.

3bb214b3-6b4b-4ef2-988d-7c50a4ec375c-0
01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:18.670
Who had the?

d5639832-b4d6-4a59-8d6a-d2b0637737eb-0
01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.827
The older man with the long
beard and long white hair is

d5639832-b4d6-4a59-8d6a-d2b0637737eb-1
01:08:23.827 --> 01:08:24.950
there to greet.

d9dd699c-020e-4042-92ae-86d1cbadf9e9-0
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:49.780
Is drawing a zigzag in above
them.

c1729d42-0743-4cd8-a4b6-86c495094a40-0
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.420
And then what he is drawing is a
crown.

073871c8-40e0-4196-8975-f208d972b405-0
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:56.470
for

98ff448b-2f91-4137-a556-0d9475600255-0
01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:02.592
He's placing it on the little
boy's head, who's kneeling in

98ff448b-2f91-4137-a556-0d9475600255-1
01:09:02.592 --> 01:09:07.534
front of him, and then they they
are leaving him. The girl is

98ff448b-2f91-4137-a556-0d9475600255-2
01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:11.600
going through the door. The boy
is waving goodbye.

574802e0-cd30-4497-af5f-074042c07094-0
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:16.540
And the man is standing there in
the birds hovering above them.

9ee2028c-6e17-40c5-af30-17f43f18befb-0
01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.699
So now they go back out through
the doors and the rain has

9ee2028c-6e17-40c5-af30-17f43f18befb-1
01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:31.750
stopped. And what they.

44e1a92d-bc18-43d6-afad-0e1adf86153c-0
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:37.880
The doors and depart on the
other side of the.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.470
Umm.

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:44.541
#END_quest Bridge. There's a
rainbow over their city, and

eac95f78-9e9f-4595-a84a-cf4c80cab390-1
01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:48.670
they're just standing there
looking at it, and they're both

eac95f78-9e9f-4595-a84a-cf4c80cab390-2
01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.730
wearing crowns and the little
bird is hovering above them.

656fc95c-0f24-4c29-b8a4-8de6fe253fe2-0

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:20.175
It looks like their daughter and
so someone is taking the picture

b75e76f6-2894-46ac-99b8-46a276fe6e53-1
01:15:20.175 --> 01:15:22.830

They don't see the package, you
just see a setup

Yeah, a box with some items in
it looks like.

1a61c740-95b7-42b9-952e-f10e0c3edcb8-0
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.727
A towels and something like a
stick sticking out of it. And

1a61c740-95b7-42b9-952e-f10e0c3edcb8-1
01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:48.460
again the picture of the the
couple and their.

39170a3b-1bbe-457b-a793-b6f9fbe2ee07-0
01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.810
In the foreground.

0f8ac767-bc2e-462c-a3f9-1d9b6f2d5833-0
01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:03.400
They are standing around a
table.

7d33a47a-e8d3-41d1-9f4f-220ba85e862b-0
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:12.082
And they have a like a suitcase
that they have on the table, and

7d33a47a-e8d3-41d1-9f4f-220ba85e862b-1
01:18:12.082 --> 01:18:17.600
they are joining hands, her
right hand and his.

9f73f5ee-3006-4a9f-a861-ff8c2f11867f-0
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:20.750
Her left hand and his right
hand.

c6693413-1309-42cf-9da7-ff11bbc0f05f-0
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:27.235
On top of the suitcase in front
of them are two cups of tea and

c6693413-1309-42cf-9da7-ff11bbc0f05f-1
01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:30.990
a tea kettle and three chairs
around the table.

e98bfa02-14ca-4f23-b8d1-26314d4b6016-0
01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:43.950
OK, here at the top we see.

cb3fccfa-a870-46bf-9bd3-c7f1514f98cc-0
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:53.348
Little girl who's in bed, she's
laying on her right side, the

cb3fccfa-a870-46bf-9bd3-c7f1514f98cc-1
01:18:53.348 --> 01:18:59.316
covers come up to her, her nose
and then she wakes up and you

cb3fccfa-a870-46bf-9bd3-c7f1514f98cc-2
01:18:59.316 --> 01:19:04.899
see the sun upon her forehead
and eyes and then she gets.

fd1cacea-36e1-45a0-b32d-53202887740d-0
01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.480
Sits up in bed, still covered up
against it.

400dde5d-e419-417c-8ec7-2a8b6c6a6a04-0
01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.680
A bowl of something. She looks
to her left as she sits down

400dde5d-e419-417c-8ec7-2a8b6c6a6a04-1
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.805
with her spoon and she she's
looking. The next picture is the

400dde5d-e419-417c-8ec7-2a8b6c6a6a04-2
01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:27.550
suitcase.

62bfa424-4d96-4b2f-b023-49fe24eed6da-0
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:33.500
And then the man who's putting
on a a Derby.

cb49f3d3-58e1-4045-88c8-56e890ba34c1-0
01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:41.997
And then the woman who's putting
on a headscarf and then the

cb49f3d3-58e1-4045-88c8-56e890ba34c1-1
01:19:41.997 --> 01:19:44.390
woman's hands tying.

862a8f57-6078-4811-89fa-7c94c99ccd0d-0
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:53.395
Something around the the girl's
neck as she's putting on a hat

862a8f57-6078-4811-89fa-7c94c99ccd0d-1
01:19:53.395 --> 01:19:54.510
and then.

f93eef0c-c5ec-47d6-8233-401140ced640-0
01:19:56.290 --> 01:20:01.716
Someone's one of them, the girl
or the woman putting on boots,

f93eef0c-c5ec-47d6-8233-401140ced640-1
01:20:01.716 --> 01:20:07.401
and then the girl is holding the
the suitcase in front of her and

f93eef0c-c5ec-47d6-8233-401140ced640-2
01:20:07.401 --> 01:20:12.311
then the the man looks, he's
looking down and he has his

f93eef0c-c5ec-47d6-8233-401140ced640-3
01:20:12.311 --> 01:20:17.738
right hand extended toward her.
And then the next scene we see

f93eef0c-c5ec-47d6-8233-401140ced640-4
01:20:17.738 --> 01:20:18.600
that they.

38d46798-c0eb-4f41-9902-a11c230e319f-0
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.500
They're walking in.

71170bd4-5ea5-41fe-b69f-ad31fb2cd440-0
01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.580


777b1005-dae2-410c-9d28-d0d9a812ca17-0
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:50.940
All right.

95de4c1e-cd5c-4fe2-8d89-0d19bd614a86-0
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.990
And then we see.

bfaa858f-2bf7-4a84-b110-b900e896a4c8-0
01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.930
Three pictures of the girl,
she's wearing a a stocking hat

bfaa858f-2bf7-4a84-b110-b900e896a4c8-1
01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:04.430
and in the first picture she's
just looking up into the sky and

bfaa858f-2bf7-4a84-b110-b900e896a4c8-2
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:09.586
then down. And here we see that
one of one of the adults is

bfaa858f-2bf7-4a84-b110-b900e896a4c8-3
01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:13.110
holding her hand and then she's
looking.

2225c189-408f-4d6e-9586-710d1357db84-0
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.927
Ahead and we see that there's a
train coming and there are

2225c189-408f-4d6e-9586-710d1357db84-1
01:21:19.927 --> 01:21:23.970
people waiting for the train.
It's must be cold.

58cbb5ae-63bc-4c89-92b0-fd6340db4bb3-0
01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:30.348
Fired, trained and has a lot of
smoke coming out of it. We see

58cbb5ae-63bc-4c89-92b0-fd6340db4bb3-1
01:21:30.348 --> 01:21:34.989
another picture of the girl
facing toward her toward the

58cbb5ae-63bc-4c89-92b0-fd6340db4bb3-2
01:21:34.989 --> 01:21:39.792
left side of the picture. So
she's facing to her right and

58cbb5ae-63bc-4c89-92b0-fd6340db4bb3-3
01:21:39.792 --> 01:21:44.758
her father's hand on her left
shoulder. And there we see the

58cbb5ae-63bc-4c89-92b0-fd6340db4bb3-4
01:21:44.758 --> 01:21:49.968
little he's taking off his hat,
and underneath the hat it's the

58cbb5ae-63bc-4c89-92b0-fd6340db4bb3-5
01:21:49.968 --> 01:21:51.190
little origami 

5b46547f-bddd-4dc9-b4e2-fa7ce1bdcfce-0
01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.953
Her. So he's talking to her.
She's looking at the origami

5b46547f-bddd-4dc9-b4e2-fa7ce1bdcfce-1
01:21:59.953 --> 01:22:00.310
bird.

c3b1f1ce-c89e-427d-a03c-c5c71c3c1720-0
01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.710
He hugs her.

b921b68f-fb0a-49f1-85da-c4999fe76980-0
01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:09.573
And then we see her looking
through her to the left, holding

b921b68f-fb0a-49f1-85da-c4999fe76980-1
01:22:09.573 --> 01:22:12.680
the bird. Her mother is crying.

cc862bce-9122-4471-9355-596dacce235c-0
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.550
Her mother and father hug each
other.

3e5fea0b-4fff-49b4-9176-bb074fb2967f-0
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.100
You know? The man whispers in
his wife's ear. And then

f8497304-af98-4b52-956b-9147f9002050-0
01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.730


5ba40b12-f9ff-4973-af39-26d967dc38f9-0
01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:32.308
And there's a picture of now
people getting on the train.

5ba40b12-f9ff-4973-af39-26d967dc38f9-1
01:22:32.308 --> 01:22:36.914
There are three hands touch in
and the next picture and then

5ba40b12-f9ff-4973-af39-26d967dc38f9-2
01:22:36.914 --> 01:22:37.820
their hands.

7830081b-4b35-405b-b3b9-1f91861e9e1d-0
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:43.390
release from each other we see
the train leaving.

850fbf21-cd61-4cf8-a2ef-41b72c85de97-0
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.501
We see the caboose and then the
smoke of the train in the

850fbf21-cd61-4cf8-a2ef-41b72c85de97-1
01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:50.070
distance.

935e067f-6586-4823-85db-361bced99d57-0
01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:02.508
Then we see here the picture of
the the family, Father, mother

935e067f-6586-4823-85db-361bced99d57-1
01:23:02.508 --> 01:23:05.500
and daughter, and then someone.

aac3d646-878c-4e91-a016-962a4d99daf9-0
01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:09.720
It looks like the father.

838d3ccc-f1ba-4b52-9ad7-512d8c70d336-0
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:18.420
It shows him holding a bowl of
something, soup, perhaps eating.

6fe4244e-c016-4452-aaf8-6d892aafaa48-0
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:25.363
Must be left-handed. He's eating
with his left hand and the spoon

6fe4244e-c016-4452-aaf8-6d892aafaa48-1
01:23:25.363 --> 01:23:29.989
spoons in his left hand. He's
he's looking at the picture and

6fe4244e-c016-4452-aaf8-6d892aafaa48-2
01:23:29.989 --> 01:23:33.570
then the next is a circular
picture of the man.

41dcda26-ef37-4092-b977-7f4118c2bcb6-0
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:38.360
Sitting with the bowl on his
lap.

df2a0196-8ae1-4cce-b62c-0e7e7655570c-0
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:45.276
Looking back and the picture in
the background on the smaller

df2a0196-8ae1-4cce-b62c-0e7e7655570c-1
01:23:45.276 --> 01:23:50.726
picture and then three small
circles and then now we see a

df2a0196-8ae1-4cce-b62c-0e7e7655570c-2
01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:51.650
number of.

bcbe5356-4f54-48ad-830e-e4f184c35d1e-0
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:58.517
#END_arrival-1 Circles on on a
black background and as it pulls

bcbe5356-4f54-48ad-830e-e4f184c35d1e-1
01:23:58.517 --> 01:24:03.703
away we see it's an ocean liner
and then we see the full picture

bcbe5356-4f54-48ad-830e-e4f184c35d1e-2
01:24:03.703 --> 01:24:05.219
of the ocean liner.

b3e7e914-a30d-4735-a716-57feecd1fba4-0
01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:19.180
{OK, let me see what we have
next.

10261df3-99db-4899-822c-f233145e62f5-0
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:25.500
OK, we have another short
story.}

bbccf6ac-a615-495a-b770-5e0e2eb9e302-0
01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:47.530
{OK, let's see. We see the the
same.}

8f4aa194-d22f-4950-b8ce-0f5136e3e205-0
01:24:57.110 --> 01:25:01.725
#START_arrival-2 And then it
looks like a man and woman and

8f4aa194-d22f-4950-b8ce-0f5136e3e205-1
01:25:01.725 --> 01:25:06.802
they're all wearing some type of
scarves or towels on their head.

8f4aa194-d22f-4950-b8ce-0f5136e3e205-2
01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:09.880
And then the next picture we see
three.

089d1cb8-2f97-4fe5-b37f-054fde917ec7-0
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.166
People in in dark coats and
pants, all wearing hats, just

089d1cb8-2f97-4fe5-b37f-054fde917ec7-1
01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:18.830
sitting and looks like they're
sitting on a bench.

8b15f633-ec9f-43d9-84a7-b04bac0f5681-0
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:26.305
We see a woman holding an infant
wrapped in in swaddling clothes

8b15f633-ec9f-43d9-84a7-b04bac0f5681-1
01:25:26.305 --> 01:25:31.470
and then a a man walking away
from her. He's wearing a.

73a4eca5-f9b0-4800-b6aa-b13445a643d3-0
01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.420
Fedora.

f7ba63ee-84d1-4535-a601-103344c318b1-0
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:38.770
And then he's sitting and he's.

68cfba6a-db60-4e6a-bd78-7e44da69eaa3-0
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:45.921
Looking at a book, we see in the
next picture, he's writing

68cfba6a-db60-4e6a-bd78-7e44da69eaa3-1
01:25:45.921 --> 01:25:51.342
something in the book, and then
he has a piece of paper, and

68cfba6a-db60-4e6a-bd78-7e44da69eaa3-2
01:25:51.342 --> 01:25:56.940
then he starts to tear out of
the book and he makes an origami

68cfba6a-db60-4e6a-bd78-7e44da69eaa3-3
01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:02.449
bird out of it. He looks at the
bird and then he looks behind

68cfba6a-db60-4e6a-bd78-7e44da69eaa3-4
01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:04.759
him and he starts to walk.

18dd3649-02f6-4020-9b71-004a8a995857-0
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:24.010
Birds.

a4fb527e-d7ec-4b51-ae30-3c45c869a459-0
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:26.600
All these birds.

756fb104-6fac-4b76-ad34-be659e4f7424-0
01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:32.933
And in the next scene we see it
looks like a a crowded city,

756fb104-6fac-4b76-ad34-be659e4f7424-1
01:26:32.933 --> 01:26:38.338
lots of skyscrapers. The city
probably is the size of New York

756fb104-6fac-4b76-ad34-be659e4f7424-2
01:26:38.338 --> 01:26:42.799
with a lot of people on the ship
looking at at the.

68a8f99f-75bc-4e17-b5b6-3e9a6d043210-0
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.330
Looking at the city.

046395e1-d5b9-4b4e-b940-44d7ea572495-0
01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.900
And then?

ae10057b-fc4e-4373-b3c9-5a7483751580-0
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:52.020
In the next over to the right we
see.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.630
It looks like a statue of two.

fb19a974-cf0d-4ecd-ba0b-781a3db5ec13-0
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:08.010
People greeting one another. The
man on the left.

301b1ee7-db87-45be-a989-a3fe1af3f7eb-0

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.080
I can't tell if it's a man or a
woman.

fccf8576-1094-468f-975a-9c144ebf88a5-0
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:22.542
But the person is wearing a a
hat. It's like a pill box type

fccf8576-1094-468f-975a-9c144ebf88a5-1
01:27:22.542 --> 01:27:24.240

0ce13ffb-93c2-4074-91f2-f3aee82e9b0e-1
01:27:30.602 --> 01:27:35.790
with its tail hanging down.
There's a suitcase and some

0ce13ffb-93c2-4074-91f2-f3aee82e9b0e-2
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:41.443
bowls and jugs at the bottom,

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:55.263
A bird on his shoulder and
beneath him some objects, sort

1f7fdeb1-21ab-4fa5-81d7-18409b55dc20-1
01:27:55.263 --> 01:27:56.530

A pail with a handle and a lid

01:28:04.496 --> 01:28:11.273
like a teepee type item there
and then in between the ocean

e02f457e-ab7f-43ea-a6d2-06b4c38e70eb-2
01:28:11.273 --> 01:28:13.420
liner and and that.

This is a smaller vessel, sort
of like taking people.

001f9668-a426-4393-84a0-45ad126aab28-0
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:21.050
No.

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:24.820
Across the Bay.

36b612a0-da40-420f-8eaa-6ccbba5fc1f6-0
01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:34.670
OK, so this is a picture.

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:38.913
Of the front of the ocean liner
with all kinds of seagulls

202c9ee1-758b-4ea1-ac1e-d36b63d84574-1
01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:40.630

01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:52.996
Side of it. And then we have a
series of pictures. Here we see

17f3b3f4-c4b7-4afd-9cc3-f90683b5515d-1
01:28:52.996 --> 01:28:53.160

Oh, half a dozen people.

d1cbafed-c0ca-4371-bdf5-65f199490dd9-0
01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.630
Just standing there, maybe
looking at the city.

f351d54a-5d87-43fa-ac41-ceed79e50bab-0
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.316
And then we see a a man in a
white coat and a white, tall

f351d54a-5d87-43fa-ac41-ceed79e50bab-1
01:29:07.316 --> 01:29:12.443

ce8d88b3-25e9-497b-8ac6-de5fea2b91da-0
01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.260
And then we see hands of people.

189d72b4-8a2e-44d9-b436-8314f9b41bea-0
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.400

b461af90-bb8a-4fdb-a966-8fefc4326f4f-0
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:22.940
The gates to go from the ship.

1aef1a11-439f-428d-82ac-3a400897e9e0-0
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:43.040
Some an older man, a younger
man, child, woman.

1a7675f3-f73b-4720-91b3-d60d7111f047-0
01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.268
#END_arrival-2 And we see a
picture of more people who are

1a7675f3-f73b-4720-91b3-d60d7111f047-1
01:29:49.268 --> 01:29:54.839

{OK, next we have another short
story.

Sorry.}

ef95c7f7-5281-4a43-aa2f-e679e43a584b-0
01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:49.207
#START_return Here we see a
young man with a beard sitting

ef95c7f7-5281-4a43-aa2f-e679e43a584b-1
01:30:49.207 --> 01:30:54.775
on a stool and working at a

office or his apartment, and
he's got a desk lamp over his

01:31:00.642 --> 01:31:01.140
head.

8ffd113a-71e9-4575-af3e-1f6a0557f622-0
01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:12.688
Below, let's see. It looks like
we're looking at a cut out of a

8ffd113a-71e9-4575-af3e-1f6a0557f622-1
01:31:12.688 --> 01:31:18.198
of an apartment building with
different rooms in it. So to his

8ffd113a-71e9-4575-af3e-1f6a0557f622-2
01:31:18.198 --> 01:31:23.796
right we see that there is a a
set of stairs going down, and on

8ffd113a-71e9-4575-af3e-1f6a0557f622-3
01:31:23.796 --> 01:31:28.519
the landing next to the stairs
there are a couple of.

d481df1d-1168-4c57-aa8d-74679d25c825-0
01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:34.190
It looks like and then next to
that is a.

8b8c8fe2-064e-409a-813a-6bec72fbbb29-0
01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:36.730
is a bedroom.

0ec02a6c-524e-47d2-821f-6bb8bb130b96-0
01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:39.500
{I need to move the.

This.

6f31c34f-23c8-4b4a-8736-bbf24fd7aace-0
01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.330
This.}

0bc7cc9d-8875-47ad-95ca-f58da864f0f9-0
01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:51.616
OK. And then next to the bedroom
is a small bathroom with a a

0bc7cc9d-8875-47ad-95ca-f58da864f0f9-1
01:31:51.616 --> 01:31:52.720
sink in it.

d9cbbc95-f64e-4cec-ba94-0e2287943e14-0
01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:57.250
All right, underneath the man in
the.

7980683c-d250-4719-9587-99f77e286c59-0
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:02.710
Stairs coming from the.

4b7bcbcd-61ac-46ea-9cc1-aaa668d48e75-0
01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:10.957
2nd floor and then at the bottom
of the stairs is either a

4b7bcbcd-61ac-46ea-9cc1-aaa668d48e75-1
01:32:10.957 --> 01:32:15.300
picture or mirror in an Oval
shape.

7e21bf26-2e89-4a5a-a7df-371c2d6eee0f-0
01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.920
And then to the right of that we
see what looks like a a pantry.

6b45485c-ff83-4de7-8599-88d5ea854b1e-0
01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:27.814
We see a lot of cabinets that
floor coming up to a table

6b45485c-ff83-4de7-8599-88d5ea854b1e-1
01:32:27.814 --> 01:32:32.490
height and then a set of
cabinets above that.

d620683d-3f38-4661-b594-f2dedc5720f4-0
01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:38.640
Next frame is the just a set of
stairs going up.

d706e6a3-afba-4ba0-8124-cf30910851ae-0
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:45.320
To a second story and then a
boy.

78a19169-e56c-4edb-9d4e-808ac48f2aca-0
01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:51.140
In his bedroom, drawing on the
wall.

1a888a57-25da-4485-9fb6-2f90753f003a-0
01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:01.750
{There's something under that,
but I can't. It's cut off.}

798ebd04-4fda-4b6c-adb8-8c64f3fd22a9-0
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:12.100
All right.

621adbd9-9613-4e35-b1f0-e1b38a4cee83-0
01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:18.933
Here we see the man who is
working at the drawing table. He

621adbd9-9613-4e35-b1f0-e1b38a4cee83-1
01:33:18.933 --> 01:33:25.147
looks behind him and he sees
that there is a a kite laying on

621adbd9-9613-4e35-b1f0-e1b38a4cee83-2
01:33:25.147 --> 01:33:31.261
the floor with a tail. He gets
off his stool and he crouches

621adbd9-9613-4e35-b1f0-e1b38a4cee83-3
01:33:31.261 --> 01:33:35.269
down and he picks up the kite
and then.

c84638a2-ecfb-4f56-aea4-e4298f277948-0
01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.772
The drawing table, the stool and
then the kite lying in the

c84638a2-ecfb-4f56-aea4-e4298f277948-1
01:33:42.772 --> 01:33:47.910
opposite direction originally
was so in the next scene we see.

6aa67017-8c6d-42c0-88da-419bd86d5ca7-0
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.080
The man has entered.

02e12d15-43b6-4104-8654-f2373f3960d4-0
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:58.846
The bottom bedroom. The door is
open, and now he's looking

02e12d15-43b6-4104-8654-f2373f3960d4-1
01:33:58.846 --> 01:34:04.263
through an archway that the
little boy had drawn in one of

02e12d15-43b6-4104-8654-f2373f3960d4-2
01:34:04.263 --> 01:34:06.100
the previous frames.

d575c50d-e77a-4314-b3bb-ff1eadb96132-0
01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:16.730
And what he does when he's.

ff016c70-4acd-4aeb-8d40-8e829dd9b04b-0
01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:19.430
He enters through this archway.

4078c81a-625d-4863-a49b-8e938964e446-0
01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:28.064
And he comes into a a force with
many looks like Chinese lanterns

4078c81a-625d-4863-a49b-8e938964e446-1
01:34:28.064 --> 01:34:35.159
hanging above him, and lights
strung from tree to tree. And

4078c81a-625d-4863-a49b-8e938964e446-2
01:34:35.159 --> 01:34:38.470
then across from him is a A.

6457609d-157e-4e27-93d3-5331eff4d811-0
01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:47.521
On the pond there is a a dock
and on the dock is a round red

6457609d-157e-4e27-93d3-5331eff4d811-1
01:34:47.521 --> 01:34:48.460
object.

1819c19a-9cba-4816-b7a0-994cf3128781-0
01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:04.092
And the man gets over to the
dock and he picks up the the

1819c19a-9cba-4816-b7a0-994cf3128781-1
01:35:04.092 --> 01:35:10.518
round object and he's standing
on the dock as a dragon boat

1819c19a-9cba-4816-b7a0-994cf3128781-2
01:35:10.518 --> 01:35:17.052
starts to come down this canal,
this waterway. And so he the

1819c19a-9cba-4816-b7a0-994cf3128781-3
01:35:17.052 --> 01:35:18.979
boat stops at the.

98bbcc28-abf8-4ee1-b2e9-2b6160c98d29-0
01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:25.185
Dock. And then the man is
standing there with the object,

98bbcc28-abf8-4ee1-b2e9-2b6160c98d29-1
01:35:25.185 --> 01:35:30.628
and then when it gets to the
middle of the dock, he proceeds

98bbcc28-abf8-4ee1-b2e9-2b6160c98d29-2
01:35:30.628 --> 01:35:35.893
to get on. And then as he gets
on, he is sort of like, you

98bbcc28-abf8-4ee1-b2e9-2b6160c98d29-3
01:35:35.893 --> 01:35:36.340
know.

17165909-c7dd-4f7f-821a-99d010db0fc8-0
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.690
Stooped position and it departs
from the boat, departs from the

17165909-c7dd-4f7f-821a-99d010db0fc8-1
01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:43.090
dock.

4de63392-c403-4f66-9e23-fe52c209806a-0
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:59.110
The boat takes him to a castle
and there is a.

cfe8c44d-0307-4cc3-a17c-eb89884960bd-0
01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:07.874
An arc arch that leads into the
castle and the castle is done up

cfe8c44d-0307-4cc3-a17c-eb89884960bd-1
01:36:07.874 --> 01:36:11.770
with some towers and some
aqueduct.

2ca7eb5e-f615-4524-99b4-1ffe2ea799c3-0
01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:19.732
And a number of round cupolas
and bell towers and so on. And

2ca7eb5e-f615-4524-99b4-1ffe2ea799c3-1
01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:26.170
then to the right of that is a
waterway and there is a.

da47435a-0ba3-4f57-b97d-9ae4f5f84235-0
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:32.258
It's a moonlit full moon night
and and it lights up some of the

da47435a-0ba3-4f57-b97d-9ae4f5f84235-1
01:36:32.258 --> 01:36:35.350
buildings opposite the the
waterway.

88372d6d-af62-4aa6-9e1b-de647a05b6c5-0
01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:41.720
And there is a car crossing over
the bridge connecting the two

88372d6d-af62-4aa6-9e1b-de647a05b6c5-1
01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:42.670
structures.

d5937d01-5e34-4b7d-9886-30b9485751d7-0
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:53.767
Here he gets off the the Dragon
boat and onto a wooden dock.

d5937d01-5e34-4b7d-9886-30b9485751d7-1
01:36:53.767 --> 01:36:55.460
There, and he has.

4564e92d-baa3-4ef7-97dd-adb9a95e31a4-0
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.840
Something in his.

c8580df5-116b-4a9d-9e3e-8c12d80193d2-0
01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:05.211
Something in his hand. And so
he's looks like he's leaped from

c8580df5-116b-4a9d-9e3e-8c12d80193d2-1
01:37:05.211 --> 01:37:11.327
the from the boat to the dock,
holding this object in his right

c8580df5-116b-4a9d-9e3e-8c12d80193d2-2
01:37:11.327 --> 01:37:17.540
hand. And there's some children,
one running up the stairs, one.

febda048-7e4b-4fe2-9c4b-111e2f76e965-0
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:21.360
Standing at the top of the
stairs.

103a1e49-fe8d-4faa-a6e0-7873789a901b-0
01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:25.750
With a woman there. And then
there's this.

114f55c7-1240-4424-9fba-1d50efecb282-0
01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.030
Bird like creature we saw in the
in one of the previous stories.

c747b069-5b2b-42e6-a1c2-9567efbc5c1a-0
01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.230
So what happens is the man.

11907bce-8e7a-4fcb-b53f-5999463f3e1b-0
01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.788
Approaches the older gentleman
we saw in a previous story, with

11907bce-8e7a-4fcb-b53f-5999463f3e1b-1
01:37:42.788 --> 01:37:47.933
the long white hair and the long
white beard and wearing a crown,

11907bce-8e7a-4fcb-b53f-5999463f3e1b-2
01:37:47.933 --> 01:37:49.570
and then he sees his.

eca87ee4-c2c8-4215-b653-765289d99794-0
01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:57.251
The the boy and the girl both
wearing, both wearing crowns.

eca87ee4-c2c8-4215-b653-765289d99794-1
01:37:57.251 --> 01:37:58.460
They're the.

0eec918f-b6f2-4cfa-ab57-6614c084914c-0
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.530
And there is a throne behind the
girl.

0053c5c0-a62f-4073-b59e-db889cd96970-0
01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.950
She's looking away from her
father.

8df8fec0-c165-4adf-a13e-c59f6e49e1a1-0
01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:12.000
So here we see that.

c33fa84c-d133-4c4d-8bed-c3e1b199b713-0
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.873
In the foreground, from left to
right, we see the the the

c33fa84c-d133-4c4d-8bed-c3e1b199b713-1
01:38:19.873 --> 01:38:25.604
father, the daughter, the son,
and then the old man. Behind the

c33fa84c-d133-4c4d-8bed-c3e1b199b713-2
01:38:25.604 --> 01:38:31.335
the son. And in the background
we see that through this doorway

c33fa84c-d133-4c4d-8bed-c3e1b199b713-3
01:38:31.335 --> 01:38:36.708
comes a man who must be a guard
of some some sort, and he's

c33fa84c-d133-4c4d-8bed-c3e1b199b713-4
01:38:36.708 --> 01:38:40.290
coming from this castle to the
outside.

1441717b-6b65-423a-a0cd-350ff027782f-0
01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:49.970
And then in the next frame we
see the the another boat we see.

f66a97ca-01d6-4926-b2e4-f5e9eda20d1e-0
01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:58.287
Waterway and we see some other
guards coming up stairs, and we

f66a97ca-01d6-4926-b2e4-f5e9eda20d1e-1
01:38:58.287 --> 01:39:03.360
see the the old man with his
hand in the air.

6a8fccd4-d15b-416e-921e-47bc8e7358b5-0
01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:09.911
And now night and the little boy
and the father and the daughter

6a8fccd4-d15b-416e-921e-47bc8e7358b5-1
01:39:09.911 --> 01:39:11.470
are standing there.

e6aa905f-27e7-4f8e-a23c-038ea2255411-0
01:39:18.190 --> 01:39:19.780
From from here.

74471af8-8262-46df-9e5d-fcf0bd1cb304-0
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.360
We see that the.

8e523ec7-64e5-4392-bcfd-a058544ade91-0
01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:31.415
Man has a a long pipe in his
hand with like a 90 degree elbow

8e523ec7-64e5-4392-bcfd-a058544ade91-1
01:39:31.415 --> 01:39:38.610
on it, and it's got to that part
of the the pipe is as very

8e523ec7-64e5-4392-bcfd-a058544ade91-2
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:39.329
short.

1f3192a8-7dbd-471d-a646-f5998e4abb2a-0
01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:45.424
And the the family is now
standing behind him, and he's

1f3192a8-7dbd-471d-a646-f5998e4abb2a-1
01:39:45.424 --> 01:39:50.814
facing the the guards who are
coming toward him. So as it

1f3192a8-7dbd-471d-a646-f5998e4abb2a-2
01:39:50.814 --> 01:39:54.160
turns out, it's some type of
sword.

64980f48-ea62-4177-ac42-99bb64160876-0
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:55.910
And or.

6b9a6028-8bbb-4c7f-ab97-3705d90baeef-0
01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.870
And he points it at the first
guard.

229287e6-03d0-4e51-aca0-3b0d079ae86d-0
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:07.251
Well then comes up with a. He
has a a box of some sort that

229287e6-03d0-4e51-aca0-3b0d079ae86d-1
01:40:07.251 --> 01:40:13.048
takes everything from like a
giant magnet that takes all the

229287e6-03d0-4e51-aca0-3b0d079ae86d-2
01:40:13.048 --> 01:40:17.419
metal from from the man and two
other guards.

d851630b-6860-466f-add6-aa578e43ca38-0
01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:23.330
Detain him while the first Guard
runs away.

88b8d0b8-52c7-43f4-a7b1-78159c7a2697-0
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:30.520
So in the next frame we see that
the.

7b04f889-4b64-4f70-92a3-50387eca94fa-0
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.830
Umm.

40b1d6c6-56f7-4e64-869d-a642a0c84671-0
01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:40.044
The boy is starting to Draw
Something that looks like a a

40b1d6c6-56f7-4e64-869d-a642a0c84671-1
01:40:40.044 --> 01:40:41.760
bird that looks like a wing.

c261ef0c-0e51-4eb5-8185-c8323626675d-0
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.062
They're standing there and the
daughter is standing there

c261ef0c-0e51-4eb5-8185-c8323626675d-1
01:40:47.062 --> 01:40:51.235
holding the the bird, the little
bird, and then there's someone

c261ef0c-0e51-4eb5-8185-c8323626675d-2
01:40:51.235 --> 01:40:52.540
running toward them.

fd65c6b7-3df7-446c-8357-891652341884-0
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:55.400
I have to move this box.

ae5e72d4-cbf9-4171-ab5c-979dcdbab883-0
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:57.530
OK, and this.

2ca6b6f7-0bd9-4a7f-ac2c-1524ec0133a8-0
01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.020
picture we see.

287c5b72-6dae-44b9-8211-f1c56ab2c517-0
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:07.716
That they've gotten onto this,
it's like a a winged bird, like

287c5b72-6dae-44b9-8211-f1c56ab2c517-1
01:41:07.716 --> 01:41:12.840
what is that Pegasus or
something? And it's flying.

5c7acfcc-cff4-40df-80b6-6700142deff3-0
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:20.882
No winged horses flying into the
night sky with the full moon

5c7acfcc-cff4-40df-80b6-6700142deff3-1
01:41:20.882 --> 01:41:22.010
behind him.

6a8bcf10-7542-48fc-aacc-4abe04d963ae-0
01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.120
Escaping the the guard.

f37099cc-d65a-4f42-b234-df3e3820c68d-0
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:29.200
And over the over the body of
water.

06f34f23-08d3-49dc-a06c-b455fb94eeac-0
01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:33.770
Here.

5262695e-c48c-4b3c-bc87-a29fbf52974f-0
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:37.840
We see that.

2b7ac776-28f4-4244-9d0e-98609274463a-0
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.870
As they're flying.

c3ee810e-0357-418c-bee9-539b51e3b2b4-0
01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.520
Then it looks like.

a378e2f3-14e2-4c87-8102-16bff1da3b75-0
01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:49.200
The village behind the city, or
the castle behind him is.

e2502a51-8a1b-4852-ac43-df4dd9caf09a-0
01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:51.210
being

d7fb988a-cb63-4491-9567-740e5ca5dfb1-0
01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:56.660
The boy is holding up his hands
as if hurtling.

75c25405-c6ca-4b9f-ae2e-2c10e61122c2-0
01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:06.900
The the Guards and the buildings
down like backwards.

b181c2b0-3ddd-4910-95f7-e99c469d22c6-0
01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:11.929
And they're they're making their
escape. The father and the

b181c2b0-3ddd-4910-95f7-e99c469d22c6-1
01:42:11.929 --> 01:42:14.990
daughter are looking back toward
the city.

8c18ecb2-d790-44cf-aff8-43a92d2f07b2-0
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.360
All right, so.

a6811e00-a081-460b-ab25-237443ab735b-0
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:23.490
In this picture we see.

4aaf65fa-12eb-4601-a8b2-7dfe1ef75146-0
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.900
A.

e767b06a-0cfa-473a-93ea-a2ade65924b5-0
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:42.951
It's got the bottom of a of a
boat, so it's got like a, a, a

e767b06a-0cfa-473a-93ea-a2ade65924b5-1
01:42:42.951 --> 01:42:44.970
rudder in the middle of it.

6d6201de-df64-4da0-b92c-606497ec2fa1-0
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:47.660
And the.

cec21036-f7dc-4504-ae07-c08fafcc24e6-0
01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:56.621
The father is grabbing his son's
hand and it looks like they've

cec21036-f7dc-4504-ae07-c08fafcc24e6-1
01:42:56.621 --> 01:43:03.384
been they've been captured by
the guards. Their father now in

cec21036-f7dc-4504-ae07-c08fafcc24e6-2
01:43:03.384 --> 01:43:05.130
this next frame.

6eefedd7-07cc-48ab-96a3-4268e68564b4-0
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:11.826
He's trying to grab his
daughter's hand and she's fallen

6eefedd7-07cc-48ab-96a3-4268e68564b4-1
01:43:11.826 --> 01:43:16.952
into the into they're both in
the ocean and her crown is

6eefedd7-07cc-48ab-96a3-4268e68564b4-2
01:43:16.952 --> 01:43:21.090
coming off, but she's still
holding the bird.

8028d3d8-92a2-40cd-aa46-e06f3c182c7b-0
01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.380
So in the next frame we see that
the.

34814771-c6fe-4aef-81e7-a4de6f3a43e4-0
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.060


6f0e99af-899d-49df-8982-99de5dd82545-0
01:43:30.210 --> 01:43:34.480
Two figures, the father and the
daughter are underwater and it

6f0e99af-899d-49df-8982-99de5dd82545-1
01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.818
looks like they're they're going
down into the water and so she

6f0e99af-899d-49df-8982-99de5dd82545-2
01:43:38.818 --> 01:43:39.700
gets out her.

7eb49b49-1d46-4c4f-a3fb-cf83e3da0eef-0
01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:47.164
Pencil and she starts drawing
something. It looks like some

7eb49b49-1d46-4c4f-a3fb-cf83e3da0eef-1
01:43:47.164 --> 01:43:48.840
type of of bottle.

6058dffa-84f3-4334-b090-2c6c7c83f106-0
01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:55.880
And in this frame.

5436e6dc-5838-4ea1-8838-ce419e2cc972-0
01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:02.560
We see some.

35211157-3bbf-4191-b410-8de9a7588930-0
01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:11.102
Some sea life, some sea plants
underneath on the ocean floor

35211157-3bbf-4191-b410-8de9a7588930-1
01:44:11.102 --> 01:44:16.702
and we see it looks like they've
made it to the surface of the

35211157-3bbf-4191-b410-8de9a7588930-2
01:44:16.702 --> 01:44:22.480
water and there's some, there's
some mountains in the background

35211157-3bbf-4191-b410-8de9a7588930-3
01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.992
and then in the next frame it
looks like they're in some type

35211157-3bbf-4191-b410-8de9a7588930-4
01:44:27.992 --> 01:44:29.770
of submarine and so.

1b3dc1b5-1dfe-4129-b629-f13d7d63f5cb-0
01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:37.543
He looks like he's guiding the
submarine on the lower level and

1b3dc1b5-1dfe-4129-b629-f13d7d63f5cb-1
01:44:37.543 --> 01:44:41.676
she's looking through a
Periscope on the upper level of

1b3dc1b5-1dfe-4129-b629-f13d7d63f5cb-2
01:44:41.676 --> 01:44:42.710
the submarine.

0396e895-21c1-42e1-8c51-71d60fc34c16-0
01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:50.510
So the submarine takes them.

48bc32b8-27c2-465f-9a13-34407cafa017-0
01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:55.020
Into what looks like a cavern.

155ab49b-6ea6-414c-90be-94facf2a64d6-0
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:04.290
They're in this large cavern.

d9b5245d-467d-4f64-be7c-698dd21bc466-0
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:06.330
And.

1b253718-0c7b-4031-9034-eb3933023267-0
01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.360
It's it's very dark and we see.

bb003909-c2bb-40d6-8006-2ddf48837d5a-0
01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.630
Figures people looks like humans
above it.

c7dc4476-c25b-4546-8bac-beb59b6aa9fc-0
01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.240
And around it in throughout the
scene.

5471c977-8a12-4c5a-8a0e-cf34ff7a4569-0
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.075
Like, get out of the submarine
and they're all they're looking

5471c977-8a12-4c5a-8a0e-cf34ff7a4569-1
01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:35.190
up, but they're looking at the
drawings. They're on the walls.

d1c39ea1-7651-46e9-b5a2-8f92011ce190-0
01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:41.042
And so that's there are drawings
on the walls. They're looking at

d1c39ea1-7651-46e9-b5a2-8f92011ce190-1
01:45:41.042 --> 01:45:43.560
a particular drawing that looks
like.

0ae0d22d-2fe0-46e9-b9a4-8a7b6716075f-0
01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:49.497
From the previous from the
previous story where the boys

0ae0d22d-2fe0-46e9-b9a4-8a7b6716075f-1
01:45:49.497 --> 01:45:53.893
kneeling down and the man is
giving him a crown and sister

0ae0d22d-2fe0-46e9-b9a4-8a7b6716075f-2
01:45:53.893 --> 01:45:58.513
standing behind him and then in
the seat behind him, it's the

0ae0d22d-2fe0-46e9-b9a4-8a7b6716075f-3
01:45:58.513 --> 01:46:01.420
opening to the to the sea and
the sky.

0c62fd77-2807-47ed-bbfc-ee1d7f76ac68-0
01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.820
And so into the.

b7c6b58b-db97-42d3-9b91-89bd3c508aa8-0
01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.980
Mouth of the cavern come.

0ad498f2-e1e7-4a93-bfe9-c833fd197670-0
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.360
Some people on a like a dragon
boat.

c140296a-fc7e-42bf-9fda-4a35bd00dc0c-0
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:23.250
And so the father we see in the
next picture.

7d58c364-287a-41c9-a78f-cb9132bda3c3-0
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:29.406
Looking at his daughter and the
bird is between them and his

7d58c364-287a-41c9-a78f-cb9132bda3c3-1
01:46:29.406 --> 01:46:32.730
fingers in the sky, so he starts
to draw a line.

2d102dcd-6064-442b-a7db-45f01dfef0e6-0
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:37.510
Up and then it looks like he's.

730cb4ee-0aef-48bb-9ffc-fd34269dd0f4-0
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:42.940
He's drawing a A frame with a.

b5014cdc-a627-4b7d-b488-68c1d70c8e32-0
01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:48.410
A swing for the bird to sit on.

c649f375-7cbb-4cbc-a086-a0b6f87c539f-0
01:46:55.780 --> 01:47:00.762
And so and and this frame. Then
we see the father and the

c649f375-7cbb-4cbc-a086-a0b6f87c539f-1
01:47:00.762 --> 01:47:05.830
daughter, and the bird is
sitting on this swing, and it's.

b632edd6-e038-438f-9f12-3c21ec01aa72-0
01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:13.851
It's all framed in with with the
top and sides and pedestal, and

b632edd6-e038-438f-9f12-3c21ec01aa72-1
01:47:13.851 --> 01:47:14.960
someone is.

df6e240e-5313-42aa-b8be-f863f6ebdd74-0
01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:20.480
the old man's stuff is running
toward it.

3f61ca49-31e1-43fc-b9bf-2876ee9a7922-0
01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:25.610
And so as he runs toward it now.

9a3facd8-481d-42aa-b0d6-ac8f78c8bcee-0
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:34.105
The the bird knocks the box out
of his hand. It goes flying on

9a3facd8-481d-42aa-b0d6-ac8f78c8bcee-1
01:47:34.105 --> 01:47:35.090
the bird.

3542c2e6-9b6e-49ce-8cc5-a46ff4433efc-0
01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:37.790
Umm.

0eead881-6261-4b30-83e0-4132d3be1ac5-0
01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:43.932
What happens to the bird? All
the the bird is still in there

0eead881-6261-4b30-83e0-4132d3be1ac5-1
01:47:43.932 --> 01:47:45.520
and the sides of the.

38819789-b86e-47cb-a6b5-be1f1a5a30ac-0
01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:54.710
What looked like ramps. They
fold up and now they capture the

38819789-b86e-47cb-a6b5-be1f1a5a30ac-1
01:47:54.710 --> 01:47:56.320
man in a in a cage.

7126849b-f0a3-494d-a183-5a66296cd3c4-0
01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.590
So in the next frame and we see
that.

5b3b22ef-cb4c-4ce6-9c20-b2f286e57359-0
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.475
Looks like the the man has
there's a a big white flash in

5b3b22ef-cb4c-4ce6-9c20-b2f286e57359-1
01:48:15.475 --> 01:48:21.487
front of him and from this flash
we see all kind of swirl of

5b3b22ef-cb4c-4ce6-9c20-b2f286e57359-2
01:48:21.487 --> 01:48:27.400
different colors. We see the
bird up in the upper left, but

5b3b22ef-cb4c-4ce6-9c20-b2f286e57359-3
01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.090
we see.

612e61ef-2b25-4648-8d11-c5c2ab9fb0fe-0
01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:37.060
Purple figure like a a dragon
type of bird and then we see.

a8d759c6-c032-4b2d-a9fa-22c6826d77f0-0
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:45.465
A lot of gold and red colors and
we see on the right hand side of

a8d759c6-c032-4b2d-a9fa-22c6826d77f0-1
01:48:45.465 --> 01:48:52.210
the page the the older man with
the the boy coming toward them.

467fa2b2-a76e-4e63-922d-f143fd6f7266-0
01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:59.282
Two of the guards and that
dragon boat and and it looks

467fa2b2-a76e-4e63-922d-f143fd6f7266-1
01:48:59.282 --> 01:49:02.550
like they're shielding their
faces from.

73192020-6dc8-4837-bff3-c7be019360f7-0
01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.510
What has happened

670a5685-0699-44bd-92ea-2457f414ad2b-0
01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:10.090
In the next frame.

2a0f1f22-cbe2-4ade-97ee-25ec04166fb4-0
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:15.441
We see standing from left to
right, or the father or the

2a0f1f22-cbe2-4ade-97ee-25ec04166fb4-1
01:49:15.441 --> 01:49:19.349
daughter, the old man with the
bird on his left shoulder and

2a0f1f22-cbe2-4ade-97ee-25ec04166fb4-2
01:49:19.349 --> 01:49:21.400
the young boy wearing his crown.

06ad6b5f-d58a-4a59-b72f-fb039334be65-0
01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:28.136
And then uh, this dragon like
creature has carried the the

06ad6b5f-d58a-4a59-b72f-fb039334be65-1
01:49:28.136 --> 01:49:33.940
cage away with the the guard in
in the cage the next is.

313bd124-1c79-40ab-8eb6-a5ed1bb533db-0
01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:38.690
They're standing on ground.

68f1404e-166d-4914-9fae-89ff87919bc0-0
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:41.170
A doorway behind the.

66c60696-f781-4681-a201-95e9e0649035-0
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:46.130
The father, his daughter, is
hugging him.

2dcc7946-7370-46f8-b395-ff5a1036b2b0-0
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:51.831
And the old man is standing and
in a background with the little

2dcc7946-7370-46f8-b395-ff5a1036b2b0-1
01:49:51.831 --> 01:49:56.173
boy, the bird on his right
shoulder, and the little boy

2dcc7946-7370-46f8-b395-ff5a1036b2b0-2
01:49:56.173 --> 01:50:00.747
standing there, and the a man
has his left hand behind the

2dcc7946-7370-46f8-b395-ff5a1036b2b0-3
01:50:00.747 --> 01:50:01.600
boy's back.

f1746893-bd02-49f6-b280-e22b2cad26ba-0
01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:13.030
All right. And then in this
picture we see a kite flying in

f1746893-bd02-49f6-b280-e22b2cad26ba-1
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:19.419
the foreground against a
background of skyscrapers and

f1746893-bd02-49f6-b280-e22b2cad26ba-2
01:50:19.419 --> 01:50:26.621
tall buildings in the park. We
see a trees in the park and we

f1746893-bd02-49f6-b280-e22b2cad26ba-3
01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:29.410
see a wall of some sort.

1f1b4ca0-0edc-4f02-aca3-d7e7159821bc-0
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:35.634
Underneath the trees and then in
the frames above, you can't see

1f1b4ca0-0edc-4f02-aca3-d7e7159821bc-1
01:50:35.634 --> 01:50:40.471
the top frame very well, but and
the frame underneath that we see

1f1b4ca0-0edc-4f02-aca3-d7e7159821bc-2
01:50:40.471 --> 01:50:43.330
that little door opening to the
light.

77d3cfec-9e44-4fd6-86f1-245f050e86f8-0
01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:46.900
Entering into the into the
bedroom.

01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:50.520
And then we see two other rooms.

350fad45-df1c-43d1-a104-0b980b4d8506-0
01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:52.290
Beneath that.

2cc63942-fe07-4f8d-89b5-a2000cf0af1c-0
01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.070

01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:58.540
#END_return And it's it's really
dark and I know there are rooms,

33d31436-eb68-4d8e-b2b6-3c3062a422dd-1
01:50:58.540 --> 01:50:59.430

them.}

01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:21.260
Next is a complex scene.}

01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:49.360
{OK.

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:51.520
Alright.}

a8461b2d-6fbb-4145-90c4-315c1bab966e-0

01:51:58.670 --> 01:52:06.225
An ocean scene and above above
water we see a lot of boats,

f2dc4336-5b87-4059-80c4-23594242ae72-1
01:52:06.225 --> 01:52:14.410
small fishing vessels for maybe
three or four people. Some have.

64f32652-592a-4a0e-89df-47aab14273b5-0
01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:21.890
Sails on them, most do not and
then we see people fishing off

64f32652-592a-4a0e-89df-47aab14273b5-1
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:28.422
them. All the boats have are
striped horizontally. We see a

64f32652-592a-4a0e-89df-47aab14273b5-2
01:52:28.422 --> 01:52:35.390
couple of large fish like whales
and we see a couple of little.

c14821ef-d8bf-4a79-8132-29cbda32e356-0
01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:43.657
Rock formations sticking out of
the water and people are sitting

c14821ef-d8bf-4a79-8132-29cbda32e356-1
01:52:43.657 --> 01:52:48.652
on those fishing and then
underneath below the water we

c14821ef-d8bf-4a79-8132-29cbda32e356-2
01:52:48.652 --> 01:52:51.150
see a lot of different size.

cdb01131-4b4d-4dd4-91f5-6b870ef9358b-0
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:57.880
And different shapes and colors
of fish and then we see some and

01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:03.745
looks like the school of fish
have gotten together and they've

cdb01131-4b4d-4dd4-91f5-6b870ef9358b-2
01:53:03.745 --> 01:53:09.610
created some some drawings that

01:53:15.474 --> 01:53:21.059
a school of fish. You have
created a a fish and so they're.

01:53:57.870 --> 01:54:03.630
Other types of fish, just a
whole bunch of fish. Here we see

f848c864-ec9d-4668-9fc0-54d35109c5e0-1
01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:09.391
some people underneath in the
water who are fishing, perhaps

f848c864-ec9d-4668-9fc0-54d35109c5e0-2
01:54:09.391 --> 01:54:13.830

animals you would see in a zoo.

c2abdcdc-865c-4e98-b7dd-889a1c484af8-1

And animals like that. We see
some flamingos walking around

01:55:53.464 --> 01:55:58.420

df2d0baf-116f-43de-8b0e-a846f40cb246-0

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:06.076

five of them are complex scenes.

Like the complex scenes like are
shorter, so they usually take

161892e6-d204-4b0e-ad53-3334a0deb3d7-1
02:03:11.806 --> 02:03:15.118

probably could finish it, yeah,
