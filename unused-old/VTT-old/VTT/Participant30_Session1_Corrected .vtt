{OK, so you are about to see a
complex scene. Imagine you are

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:18.725
thoroughly as possible. And then
for complex scenes we ask that

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:23.052
you take between 3 to 5 minutes
just to describe the scene. And

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.486
Picture of what looks like a
Roman Colosseum. And there are

58dbefb0-1967-4ad6-8694-33ee0facd7a1-1
00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:21.411
people watching what's going on.
They're sitting in the stands

58dbefb0-1967-4ad6-8694-33ee0facd7a1-2
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:24.380
and they're watching lions.

And people who are.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.850
In the arena now.

c1074d94-18a6-4082-bdad-aae42b4908f7-0
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.560
The it looks like the lions are
attacking or have attacked

c1074d94-18a6-4082-bdad-aae42b4908f7-1
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.378
people, and there there are
bodies of people lying on the on

c1074d94-18a6-4082-bdad-aae42b4908f7-2
00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:52.354
the ground. It looks like there
are people with either a large

c1074d94-18a6-4082-bdad-aae42b4908f7-3
00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:56.540
sticks or Spears or or
something, and they're either

c1074d94-18a6-4082-bdad-aae42b4908f7-4
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.910
defending themselves or their.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.010
Maybe they're fighting against
each other.

07fd4e63-a168-4784-9a5b-16a0ac310220-0
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.490
And so.

6d177921-0a30-4ef9-b8a0-b73e43f73942-0
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.464
You see a people who are
standing on each others

6d177921-0a30-4ef9-b8a0-b73e43f73942-1
00:03:10.464 --> 00:03:15.589
shoulders trying to, it looks
like they're trying to escape

6d177921-0a30-4ef9-b8a0-b73e43f73942-2
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:20.969
the arena and get into the seats
of the Colosseum and it looks

6d177921-0a30-4ef9-b8a0-b73e43f73942-3
00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.264
like there are lions who have
climbed up on top of each other

6d177921-0a30-4ef9-b8a0-b73e43f73942-4
00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:31.474
and there is one lion that's
trying to get into the seats of

6d177921-0a30-4ef9-b8a0-b73e43f73942-5
00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:32.669
the Colosseum.

3453486c-3ce7-4ae5-a9c7-627c896bac20-0
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.728
And then it looks like there is
a there are Chariots racing

3453486c-3ce7-4ae5-a9c7-627c896bac20-1
00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:45.360
around the arena while all this
is happening. So.

6a3b437b-89ae-4d97-918d-a82dfa9ad094-0
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.962
I see it. It looks like Chariots
with four horses pulling the

6a3b437b-89ae-4d97-918d-a82dfa9ad094-1
00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:57.260
chariot, so there must be a
chariot race going on at the

6a3b437b-89ae-4d97-918d-a82dfa9ad094-2
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.190
same time.

e1afbc9f-5a62-41c9-8d48-c357fad72402-0
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.598
And that's basically the action
that's there. The Colosseum

e1afbc9f-5a62-41c9-8d48-c357fad72402-1
00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:09.400
walls are are white with some
type of.

c593c47c-44dc-4471-889f-548647309747-0
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.670
Banners and bunting. There's a.

2feeaaaf-6069-4455-88ed-780944c41d12-0
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.230
#END_ancient_rome There is a
type of tarp or cloth that hangs

2feeaaaf-6069-4455-88ed-780944c41d12-1
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.650
over with the a symbol of
ancient Rome in it. So that's

2feeaaaf-6069-4455-88ed-780944c41d12-2
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.360
that's basically what I see.

a41b37ad-08cc-4183-9d95-4be955807a9a-0
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.920
{OK, perfect. Let me see what we
have next.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.020
Next we have another complex
scene.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.150

second.}

describe what you see.}

00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:21.827
#START_by_the_lake OK, well,
this is obviously at a lake and

67610801-144c-47a1-be4e-a51ab0fdb5fb-2
00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:22.270
there.

e4000e12-976c-418c-8ff7-c3daec8080c2-0
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.163
Are in the foreground. There is
a beach and it's crowded. There

e4000e12-976c-418c-8ff7-c3daec8080c2-1
00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:34.494
are people playing volleyball
and looks like there's someone

e4000e12-976c-418c-8ff7-c3daec8080c2-2
00:05:34.494 --> 00:05:39.563
who's trying to. They have a
rowboat that perhaps they're

e4000e12-976c-418c-8ff7-c3daec8080c2-3
00:05:39.563 --> 00:05:44.544
going to take out into the
water, and there are children

e4000e12-976c-418c-8ff7-c3daec8080c2-4
00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:48.739
and other people building
sandcastles and then.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.600
There is a.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.180
The lifeguard or someone with an
umbrella. There are people who

544c60af-1f48-4da3-a080-0ed7e5749b37-1
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.962
are shading themselves with
large parasols or umbrellas. At

544c60af-1f48-4da3-a080-0ed7e5749b37-2
00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:07.504
the top right there's a looks
like a cabin with a set of

544c60af-1f48-4da3-a080-0ed7e5749b37-3
00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:12.286
stairs coming down. There are
some trees in the background.

544c60af-1f48-4da3-a080-0ed7e5749b37-4
00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:17.307
Further in the background, in
the middle of the picture on the

00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:22.088
other side of the lake, I see a
mountains and it looks like

544c60af-1f48-4da3-a080-0ed7e5749b37-6
00:06:22.088 --> 00:06:24.400
someone's either parasailing.

scene.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.961
There are there. There's a like
a two-story old house on the

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:40.026
left top of the screen. So in
the in the water there are

61246ac9-404e-4af8-a305-0cee997e7e7a-2
00:06:40.026 --> 00:06:45.181
people swimming, there are
people kayaking there. Someone

00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:50.958
looks like they're on a pontoon
boat or raft or something. There

61246ac9-404e-4af8-a305-0cee997e7e7a-4
00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:56.556
are people who are fishing off
the dock. There are a number of

sailboats in the distance, and

a4b5db6f-7dd9-48b4-ad54-d49de06c6f0a-1
00:07:05.856 --> 00:07:07.930

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.946
{OK, so this first story is 6
slides long and I'm going to

e74a97c5-da79-49c8-afd6-c44519a60e47-1
00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:43.810
share my screen.}

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.050
{OK.

7f18d2a5-29f1-42e9-93fa-cbf3cad96938-0
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.260
Do I?}

62809c4a-613f-4ae4-be1d-e40246cfa911-0
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.776
{OK, yeah. So just describe what
you see happening in the story.

62809c4a-613f-4ae4-be1d-e40246cfa911-1
00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:12.494
OK, just go from like top left
to right. So this this book, so

62809c4a-613f-4ae4-be1d-e40246cfa911-2
00:09:12.494 --> 00:09:17.211
this is like, this is one page.
OK yeah, sometimes they switch

62809c4a-613f-4ae4-be1d-e40246cfa911-3
00:09:17.211 --> 00:09:21.329
up their formatting, so
sometimes it'll go across this

62809c4a-613f-4ae4-be1d-e40246cfa911-4
00:09:21.329 --> 00:09:25.896
way. But this one, it'll start
on this page and then this is

62809c4a-613f-4ae4-be1d-e40246cfa911-5
00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:27.020
the next page.}

cb13d468-3c66-4519-91d7-709867e125eb-0
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:35.965
#START_arrival-6 To me it looks
like that there is a a pot

cb13d468-3c66-4519-91d7-709867e125eb-1
00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:42.458
that's sitting on a table or
shelf near the window a a clay

cb13d468-3c66-4519-91d7-709867e125eb-2
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:48.519
pot that someone has has made,
and then in the next two

cb13d468-3c66-4519-91d7-709867e125eb-3
00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:52.739
pictures I can see a. It looks
like a.

68021ff2-488f-414b-9464-bfbb432c47ce-0
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.060
A hand or some something that's.

978c1c01-7e9f-461c-8d8d-a31fe56c4ae9-0
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.670
On top of the pot, it's really
hard to.

bfbb9aa0-48c7-4cd3-8d7b-95ca5af69bc0-0
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.810
See that and then.

bf10ab7f-07cd-40f1-a054-3a0d00da73b2-0
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.280
So I think the the.

abe24ccd-a6d2-4f7c-b881-274e59bf8637-0
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.730
And.

0ea96586-6eca-45e8-867a-1505c8820600-0
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:18.510
Ah, the the pot is now. I see
it's outside of.

fe90ef36-4bc7-4146-af95-7d3bb0169df1-0
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.180
It looks like it's outside and
it looks like.

de96b4b7-67ab-435a-959a-3f3804dae153-0
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.180
There is a.

f7235f0d-73ae-44a9-9f38-06d8ab06cee0-0
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.750
A man whose

c997cbdb-a340-467d-a375-26c36279ac1e-0
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:37.188
On the opposite side of the pot
and he has a lamp, kerosene

c997cbdb-a340-467d-a375-26c36279ac1e-1
00:10:37.188 --> 00:10:43.428
lamp, and he's wearing a vest
and a tie and long sleeves and

c997cbdb-a340-467d-a375-26c36279ac1e-2
00:10:43.428 --> 00:10:43.939
he's.

1b46d983-1808-4f6e-b48e-10547d433dd0-0
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.850
Has a pen in his hand and he's
starting to write on paper.

55a04dae-9ada-403e-bc3d-03195bc13804-0
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.350
He's writing a letter or a note,
and he's folding up the paper.

3bf210ba-31bb-4667-9bf1-06be08fab586-0
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.200


865765cd-8dd5-410f-8399-2b94a317452e-0
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:06.181
Looks like a triangle, but now
it looks like he's doing origami

865765cd-8dd5-410f-8399-2b94a317452e-1
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:10.870
because the next picture shows a
a bird and then he.

ed55571f-81c2-48ed-b9e6-34980cebb739-0
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.480
Takes some money out of a wallet
and he.

f8351eea-bf59-4a9e-b01b-4e4b25bedc0f-0
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.490
Licks the the paper.

191ca29d-e536-4509-9c09-3fcfcdc91e9b-0
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.080
And it looks like he's.

99863704-ed29-4adf-8d60-f7a0afd2b955-0
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.160
Putting I think he's putting it
in an envelope.

fdac5ca1-2c0d-4a79-8101-0a88a97e83b1-0
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.803
And he's licking an envelope and
I think he's putting his stamp

fdac5ca1-2c0d-4a79-8101-0a88a97e83b1-1
00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:34.070
on it.

ab4a2a68-99db-448b-a80a-c109d0091e7a-0
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.795
And he he's taking that, walking
down the stairs, he meets a

ab4a2a68-99db-448b-a80a-c109d0091e7a-1
00:11:41.795 --> 00:11:42.370
lady.

33242bce-baea-4001-b7cd-e46d2e4a84dd-0
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.600
And that person is.

c44164b4-343a-4e01-8d33-6dec2e535c05-0
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.897
Pointing her arm or left arm, I
think it looks like giving

c44164b4-343a-4e01-8d33-6dec2e535c05-1
00:11:51.897 --> 00:11:55.000
directions and then he walks
over to.

6d988ed6-c420-481b-9f60-47f2aaa084f4-0
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.700
What looks like a.

b8a7f4c5-8292-4906-bdde-30e86d1c5648-0
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.910
A mailbox.

1f9b9dc8-1b75-4eaa-99e8-6fc6935c7875-0
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.650
Of some sort. And then he reads.

02af2da5-2bc1-4abd-9538-370ddf2348d3-0
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.500
Directions on it and he puts the
letter.

1b1c7ca1-5e98-41ef-828f-fc86e8b69a1e-0
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.530
in the mailbox, and then he
looks up to the sky.

aa4c7e5d-6a41-416e-aa7b-ca292515c2fd-0
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.530
And then he the scene expands
with.

1b222588-92e8-4da8-a03d-af86564bd99a-0
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.113
It's a landscape with giant. It
looks like giant leaves, or

1b222588-92e8-4da8-a03d-af86564bd99a-1
00:12:25.113 --> 00:12:29.950
maybe they're bushes and he's
walking away from that.

9b77a7bb-be7d-4a6a-92f4-9100dedf2de4-0
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.280
Post office box and he's walking
down a hillside.

6e766641-a376-453d-9f72-28b4abb060d7-0
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.530
{OK.

dea627cf-692c-4c09-bf4a-ebb3c8b88cfa-0
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.230
Keep going.

bf3ba012-8a19-4e69-8f1a-b475ec9f884b-0
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.160
Ohh OK so.}

e90506ac-8849-4c31-8575-172496a3d78a-0
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:57.630
It does look like a a leaf and
then the leaf is green and it's

e90506ac-8849-4c31-8575-172496a3d78a-1
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:04.030
set against the white background
and in the 2nd frame it starts

e90506ac-8849-4c31-8575-172496a3d78a-2
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.930
to split.

38245d3a-f6c7-4fe0-bd57-ef4ea2e27b35-0
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:06.890
And then?

75c29fab-1a16-45c5-bf2a-9f32b6920682-0
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.590
Going across, it's splits even
more.

4cde9463-91cb-4ff5-95cb-acf7b4fd9195-0
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.533
And then even more and it starts
to look like it's becoming a

4cde9463-91cb-4ff5-95cb-acf7b4fd9195-1
00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:19.470
bird or a butterfly, something
with wings.

868ecd69-8e25-4288-8933-13afbb756fbf-0
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.272
Or maybe the the leaves are are
dying and then there's a stem

868ecd69-8e25-4288-8933-13afbb756fbf-1
00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:32.162
that's in the middle of the leaf
that's being formed, and then as

868ecd69-8e25-4288-8933-13afbb756fbf-2
00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:37.070
the leaves fall off, as the arms
fall off, there is a.

26fa0cf7-8507-4605-b4e2-2aa825cdffc8-0
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.050
A small.

f2658cd8-0eca-4e74-b335-5c3ac33c02d8-0
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:46.827
Plant at the head of it looks
like a sunflower, more Daisy,

f2658cd8-0eca-4e74-b335-5c3ac33c02d8-1
00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:52.449
and then as it gets bigger it
starts to look like a a rose

f2658cd8-0eca-4e74-b335-5c3ac33c02d8-2
00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:58.071
window, like from in a in a
church and that is in the next

f2658cd8-0eca-4e74-b335-5c3ac33c02d8-3
00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:03.597
frame. It looks to me like this
thing has evolved into an

f2658cd8-0eca-4e74-b335-5c3ac33c02d8-4
00:14:03.597 --> 00:14:04.359
eyeball.

4f4223fd-3605-4dd5-a9de-bfd9111e72f5-0
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.140
With like a pupil in the middle.

e8e15ced-afd2-423a-8fd5-c29ca810470d-0
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:16.034
And continues that in the next
branch, and now this circle

e8e15ced-afd2-423a-8fd5-c29ca810470d-1
00:14:16.034 --> 00:14:17.100
begins to.

598bd0a2-f360-479a-b36d-0ed8a2f1bbfa-0
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:26.138
I have six sides to it, so at
the end of on the perimeter of

598bd0a2-f360-479a-b36d-0ed8a2f1bbfa-1
00:14:26.138 --> 00:14:34.760
what the petal is, it looks like
it. There are six seeds, and.

15c890b3-84cf-43f5-a0f3-c16ff99a5748-0
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.910
There are little it looks like
the little origami.

f826cdeb-11c2-42fc-99da-9ebc49267cbd-0
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:47.890
Surrounding the the, the, the
flower, the plant, and then.

c30858f8-bd82-436b-84b5-7f76dcc24a98-0
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.878
There is nothing in the in the
there are there. They have

c30858f8-bd82-436b-84b5-7f76dcc24a98-1
00:14:54.878 --> 00:14:59.439
disappeared in the next frame
and then something else

c30858f8-bd82-436b-84b5-7f76dcc24a98-2
00:14:59.439 --> 00:15:04.169
reappears and the following
frame and the pods now have

c30858f8-bd82-436b-84b5-7f76dcc24a98-3
00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:09.152
turned from. I think they're
falling out or they turn from

c30858f8-bd82-436b-84b5-7f76dcc24a98-4
00:15:09.152 --> 00:15:14.220
white to black and then the
flower begins to get darker and

c30858f8-bd82-436b-84b5-7f76dcc24a98-5
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.430
then it looks like it turns to
black.

d490146a-d772-4716-bb73-17124267445c-0
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.188
And then it starts to
disintegrate and just

d490146a-d772-4716-bb73-17124267445c-1
00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:27.711
disintegrate even more and in
the following frame more and it

d490146a-d772-4716-bb73-17124267445c-2
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:33.322
looks like it's just a a wire
skeleton to the flower. And then

d490146a-d772-4716-bb73-17124267445c-3
00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:38.933
it begins to sink, looks like it
begins to sink into the, into

d490146a-d772-4716-bb73-17124267445c-4
00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:39.290
the.

c7e781e3-c8ad-4598-9915-14d12f589ef8-0
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:40.970
Ground.

855566de-bc77-416a-8465-bb32832bc2a4-0
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.200
OK, and this picture on the
left.

7d87be79-f082-479a-a093-d5d5d52defe7-0
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.540
It looks like.

c05f1118-586b-403a-94d6-5a7b9940b1b8-0
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:51.210
Some.

9d6957e1-f91b-48cc-a5f0-805e9a1e5e41-0
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.885
It it looks like some kind of a
futuristic setting, so in the

9d6957e1-f91b-48cc-a5f0-805e9a1e5e41-1
00:15:59.885 --> 00:16:02.250
background I see a large.

f5ed9118-3d05-49d2-b69e-1cf05eda7444-0
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:10.360
It looks like a a large building
with many little windows in it.

f5ed9118-3d05-49d2-b69e-1cf05eda7444-1
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.813
On top of that there's a some
type of tent that's setting up

f5ed9118-3d05-49d2-b69e-1cf05eda7444-2
00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:17.780
there and then to the.

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-0
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.827
Or maybe what this is, it also
resembles. It looks like a

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-1
00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:28.687
building, but it it may be it
has some. Think of a dishwasher

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-2
00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:33.548
and when you pull the rack out
and you see some of the dishes

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-3
00:16:33.548 --> 00:16:37.781
in it, so it looks like a
building that resembles a a

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-4
00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:42.250
dishwasher. And then in the
foreground there's something

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-5
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:47.110
that looks like a platter and on
on top of the platter is set

59634e28-f38e-4430-b5b6-7d80f2a43827-6
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.129
some kind of.

75c067c2-f250-4574-b73f-c3e926738b86-0
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:55.537
Other box with the different
geometric shapes coming out of

75c067c2-f250-4574-b73f-c3e926738b86-1
00:16:55.537 --> 00:16:57.180
it, cones and.

7393b93e-5839-4cbb-84d1-78e0a8c1dd3f-0
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.770
It looks like stick figures.

8abdc3a1-16eb-4104-8b5b-812c55cf8787-0
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.190
And.

e9657790-bdfe-49ee-9314-34dfd2241d46-0
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:04.290
Uh.

c62e22ee-95ec-461c-9597-280422d80a46-0
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.523
I can't really tell what that
is, but it it it it it's just

c62e22ee-95ec-461c-9597-280422d80a46-1
00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:12.970
kind of futuristic in the next
scene.

e7d57ffa-88d8-46e5-85ba-1226d1523a87-0
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:21.350
There are in the background some
some Gray dishes coming closer

e7d57ffa-88d8-46e5-85ba-1226d1523a87-1
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:27.710
to us. There are some cylinders
and there is a a cone such as a

e7d57ffa-88d8-46e5-85ba-1226d1523a87-2
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:33.971
teepee. And then coming closer
on the left hand side, it looks

e7d57ffa-88d8-46e5-85ba-1226d1523a87-3
00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:39.437
like a smokestack that's
surrounded by a couple of big

e7d57ffa-88d8-46e5-85ba-1226d1523a87-4
00:17:39.437 --> 00:17:45.400
wheels or big dishes and then
even further or closer to us.

f9aa401b-cc74-4675-ad03-fd00d19815fc-0
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:52.424
And and the lower left there is
a cylinder with some ceramic

f9aa401b-cc74-4675-ad03-fd00d19815fc-1
00:17:52.424 --> 00:17:59.007
pots on it. Looks like little
trees like conifers or pine

f9aa401b-cc74-4675-ad03-fd00d19815fc-2
00:17:59.007 --> 00:18:00.370
trees on it.

48fe3eb3-b351-4a13-b7a1-7197daaef998-0
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:07.363
Next to it on its, on its right,
on the like on the ground, it

48fe3eb3-b351-4a13-b7a1-7197daaef998-1
00:18:07.363 --> 00:18:09.850
looks like it's sort of like a.

582810e4-ddf7-4bce-9f21-db358da70909-0
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.620
Undulated.

ba887fac-647e-4864-9013-4a6c7f58c868-0
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.240
Terrace and it they're little.

ac8c15bb-1ba3-491b-9eb6-41e1204fa5bf-0
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:23.942
Little looks like little plants
growing on that, and even closer

ac8c15bb-1ba3-491b-9eb6-41e1204fa5bf-1
00:18:23.942 --> 00:18:29.345
to the to the front are some
other clay pots with some. One

ac8c15bb-1ba3-491b-9eb6-41e1204fa5bf-2
00:18:29.345 --> 00:18:34.838
looks empty, the other one has
something sticking up from it

ac8c15bb-1ba3-491b-9eb6-41e1204fa5bf-3
00:18:34.838 --> 00:18:37.900
and there are a couple of
dishes.

1018b0c4-e824-4541-b34c-799fc295a26d-0
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.230
To the to their left.

523c881f-f997-4ead-8fc5-1f7f4c6dcd1e-0
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.800
OK.

a3ba4434-9f69-41db-bab5-8527c36f7f58-0
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.354
OK. And and this scene we have
that we return to the clay pot

a3ba4434-9f69-41db-bab5-8527c36f7f58-1
00:18:52.354 --> 00:18:56.944
and it looks like there's
something coming down, maybe

a3ba4434-9f69-41db-bab5-8527c36f7f58-2
00:18:56.944 --> 00:19:01.785
it's an insect, looks like an
insect that's coming in and

a3ba4434-9f69-41db-bab5-8527c36f7f58-3
00:19:01.785 --> 00:19:04.790
maybe planting something or it
has.

0a3f57c7-f151-4beb-85b8-9bf58ccbed5c-0
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:11.764
Or hovers over the pot and then
it it it gets closer. And the

0a3f57c7-f151-4beb-85b8-9bf58ccbed5c-1
00:19:11.764 --> 00:19:16.926
next scene we see a a man
sitting in his room. It looks

0a3f57c7-f151-4beb-85b8-9bf58ccbed5c-2
00:19:16.926 --> 00:19:22.457
like he's he's looking at a
picture, maybe a picture of his

0a3f57c7-f151-4beb-85b8-9bf58ccbed5c-3
00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:23.840
family and his.

11a9a758-6924-4763-8966-bbf21bdfae2b-0
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.613
He's sitting on the bed facing
the window and it it doesn't

11a9a758-6924-4763-8966-bbf21bdfae2b-1
00:19:30.613 --> 00:19:32.360
look like he's got.

7329661a-2995-431b-9613-ca6b8550c9a4-0
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.984
Much there because as his socks
are hanging on a on a

7329661a-2995-431b-9613-ca6b8550c9a4-1
00:19:38.984 --> 00:19:43.879
clothesline, I see a pair of
pants on the clothesline. It's

7329661a-2995-431b-9613-ca6b8550c9a4-2
00:19:43.879 --> 00:19:48.284
it's got everything just
hanging. So he doesn't maybe

7329661a-2995-431b-9613-ca6b8550c9a4-3
00:19:48.284 --> 00:19:50.649
he's doing his laundry there.

673acaad-3c1a-4daf-9ad3-904fa7d750d5-0
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:57.384
Closer to the window is a chair
and a A with something hung over

673acaad-3c1a-4daf-9ad3-904fa7d750d5-1
00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:58.560
it, and a desk.

a6514603-216a-40f6-a4dd-28e513c54966-0
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.880
With some items on it.

b0e9df87-a39b-4a81-b31c-82a465dbf932-0
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.070
Then we go to the next frame.

5897d76e-99a1-47e9-ad79-2e683bacc4fb-0
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.280
And it looks like.

07fc72e8-5ccf-45aa-a522-514d04cbf840-0
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.270
Some type of.

db825ddb-d7c0-439e-b463-57c6082121e4-0
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:17.610
Whale like a beached whale and
something in the background.

db825ddb-d7c0-439e-b463-57c6082121e4-1
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:23.323
Then in the next frame it looks
like this creature starts to

db825ddb-d7c0-439e-b463-57c6082121e4-2
00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:28.850
lift itself up on on two arms
and then it maybe it's maybe

db825ddb-d7c0-439e-b463-57c6082121e4-3
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:34.844
it's flies, maybe it swims, but
then it looks like it begins to

db825ddb-d7c0-439e-b463-57c6082121e4-4
00:20:34.844 --> 00:20:39.060
move away. In the next scene we
see the man.

9f2a161c-f66c-4773-a171-0fc0cfffe46f-0
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.789
Holding the picture in his left
hand and turning to the right,

9f2a161c-f66c-4773-a171-0fc0cfffe46f-1
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:51.122
turning his head and looking at
something and the following

9f2a161c-f66c-4773-a171-0fc0cfffe46f-2
00:20:51.122 --> 00:20:56.544
scene we we see the tail of this
creature coming down into a

9f2a161c-f66c-4773-a171-0fc0cfffe46f-3
00:20:56.544 --> 00:21:01.610
square hole, and there's a
ladder there. Following that,

9f2a161c-f66c-4773-a171-0fc0cfffe46f-4
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:07.210
the man starts to climb down the
ladder. We see this creature.

16d51360-fbe3-4ebe-80c3-487b069af0c8-0
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:14.530
It looks like a shark with a
tail, and it's got ears, the

16d51360-fbe3-4ebe-80c3-487b069af0c8-1
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:14.940
man.

7009b30c-bfa4-4847-8f4c-bc0acca518ab-0
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:22.740
And it's looking at something on
the floor, so it's looking at

7009b30c-bfa4-4847-8f4c-bc0acca518ab-1
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.754
what looks like a letter, an
envelope. The man's thumb comes

7009b30c-bfa4-4847-8f4c-bc0acca518ab-2
00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:34.866
down, or the man comes to pick
up the the envelope. While the

7009b30c-bfa4-4847-8f4c-bc0acca518ab-3
00:21:34.866 --> 00:21:41.077
creature is staring up at him,
he looks in the envelope and he

7009b30c-bfa4-4847-8f4c-bc0acca518ab-4
00:21:41.077 --> 00:21:47.387
pulls out the origami and he has
such a happy expression on his

7009b30c-bfa4-4847-8f4c-bc0acca518ab-5
00:21:47.387 --> 00:21:47.880
face.

e713dc77-f007-474a-9b6c-9625c1fd345f-0
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.524
And then he opens up the origami
and realizes it's a letter. And

e713dc77-f007-474a-9b6c-9625c1fd345f-1
00:21:54.524 --> 00:22:00.496
so he looks out of the window up
into the sky, and he's he's

e713dc77-f007-474a-9b6c-9625c1fd345f-2
00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:06.763
thinking. And so he he it seems
that the story is about one man

e713dc77-f007-474a-9b6c-9625c1fd345f-3
00:22:06.763 --> 00:22:10.190
who writes a letter to his
friend.

1133a498-8a5d-4f1c-ae5e-89a5e1103804-0
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.370
OK.

434743a5-dbf6-4363-9dc9-4b096ced67af-0
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:25.976
And in this scene we see an
origami that looks like a four

434743a5-dbf6-4363-9dc9-4b096ced67af-1
00:22:25.976 --> 00:22:30.210
legged winged creature with its.

58ff5983-bf82-4fa1-afde-9800bbfe9eca-0
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.860
Head protruding from it and then
looking back.

ec6b4a84-df33-4b5a-bab6-651935345469-0
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:44.263
Or it may be that creature we
saw previously that's formed

ec6b4a84-df33-4b5a-bab6-651935345469-1
00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:49.360
into an origami. The next
picture we see a.

2f410c24-6298-4be9-b223-8a294e10c6cc-0
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.160
A cone.

b317ddd7-3d12-4e06-b8ce-9973603ad8d6-0
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.040
With.

42d09cf9-91aa-481d-a02e-1c30cb31887d-0
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.844
A cut out in in the middle of it
and in the middle there is a

42d09cf9-91aa-481d-a02e-1c30cb31887d-1
00:22:59.844 --> 00:23:01.550
some type of white dial.

75901ded-ecc9-40ac-a93c-618b94be4417-0
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.340
The next frame shows a.

1ddf1845-090d-4e54-9a6d-9e3bbad0d1d1-0
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:12.512
The hat that's hung on the wall
from a hook, and then next to it

1ddf1845-090d-4e54-9a6d-9e3bbad0d1d1-1
00:23:12.512 --> 00:23:13.600
a garment.

1286d5cc-f987-4639-a058-9e4c893b1c4a-0
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:21.070
In the next scene we see a bowl
with what looks like.

17e84b6b-8472-442a-8356-b5850cf1e51e-0
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:29.291
Curled tentacles from an octopus
in it and then in the next scene

17e84b6b-8472-442a-8356-b5850cf1e51e-1
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:35.730
we see a drawing of a of like a
child's drawing of a boat.

239e3fb2-e3dd-4e6b-9ea3-29efa86f66f3-0
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.250
This is followed by the scene.

164963eb-1f7b-4c8d-8109-fd5074440052-0
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:40.690
With the.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:41.970
Umm.

f25fe56e-be9b-4ac7-a6c0-0c1affc101de-0
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:48.420
With a bell, it looks like to me
a bell and then some type of.

57e4b8e5-c3ff-4cff-bd04-0b0b2d0ed2a8-0
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.797
I'm not really sure what it is.
Following that we see a. It

57e4b8e5-c3ff-4cff-bd04-0b0b2d0ed2a8-1
00:23:56.797 --> 00:24:02.420
looks like a a cup of soup on a
on a saucer and maybe a.

81fd2dd4-7663-4416-9b9f-37bd5b169f23-0
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:10.671
A handle or a spoon sticking out
from that. Following that we see

81fd2dd4-7663-4416-9b9f-37bd5b169f23-1
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:14.440
a picture of a family it looks
like.

effc50c8-0a56-45ae-8b82-30c638488d3f-0
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.130
Father, mother and daughter. And
then finally.

98b47e4a-9b59-4059-a6b5-b7dfa6d0767c-0
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.410
A hand, a larger hand, an adult
hand, a handing.

ca52d24a-8e0e-49bb-b8b1-59ce6cbd17fb-0
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:31.920
Something looks like a coin to a
hand that a child's hand.

fbeabeec-f173-47cd-9821-2f596f7dfb29-0
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.439
All right, so in this scene we
see the family sitting at a

fbeabeec-f173-47cd-9821-2f596f7dfb29-1
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:40.930
table.

b1fcb85e-a38e-4b47-a7ca-a6c1f27ce230-0
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.430
Having a meal and so.

ed9b57b4-a5f5-4a5a-847d-61613e2d8649-0
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:53.063
This little creature reappears
in the lower right. It's got

ed9b57b4-a5f5-4a5a-847d-61613e2d8649-1
00:24:53.063 --> 00:24:54.880
four legs, eyes.

c24c10a8-ea82-41ac-91bc-172e9b0ffad4-0
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:02.734
Ears and a curly tail, and it's
looking up at the girl who's

c24c10a8-ea82-41ac-91bc-172e9b0ffad4-1
00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:09.757
sitting across from her mother.
So we see her back sitting in a

c24c10a8-ea82-41ac-91bc-172e9b0ffad4-2
00:25:09.757 --> 00:25:13.050
straight back chair and she's.

b79f63f1-a76c-4de8-a53b-770e27615a01-0
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.368
Taking she has her hand out and
her father or or maybe her

b79f63f1-a76c-4de8-a53b-770e27615a01-1
00:25:19.368 --> 00:25:22.710
brother that's a male in the
picture.

a1785d42-a327-4f40-9732-7c3c920d1aa2-0
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.460
He's handy putting something in
her hand.

e0319b05-5c0f-4baa-a805-fd906712f55b-0
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.680
And he's got.

14d937f0-1990-4025-bf14-cde086c5e8ff-0
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.920
His right hand up and he's got
his fingers extended.

624f9f69-1169-4756-980e-c4a802869e19-0
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.211
And then the woman is sitting to
his right across from the girl,

624f9f69-1169-4756-980e-c4a802869e19-1
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:40.270
and she's just sitting at her.

f7e4783f-0050-4f54-8b57-a397eab53838-0
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.985
In her chair, just looking at at
this and in the background we

f7e4783f-0050-4f54-8b57-a397eab53838-1
00:25:46.985 --> 00:25:51.523
see all kinds of we see the
man's hack and maybe a a cloth

f7e4783f-0050-4f54-8b57-a397eab53838-2
00:25:51.523 --> 00:25:56.137
hanging there. So the items I
described previously with the

f7e4783f-0050-4f54-8b57-a397eab53838-3
00:25:56.137 --> 00:26:00.982
cone and the dial, they're up
against the wall, so they're all

f7e4783f-0050-4f54-8b57-a397eab53838-4
00:26:00.982 --> 00:26:05.982
wall decorations. Maybe it's an
old radio, but then we see on on

f7e4783f-0050-4f54-8b57-a397eab53838-5
00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:09.520
the wall behind them some flower
decorations.

85fff4b9-1cd5-41e7-b1e9-da9c91458f9c-0
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:17.492
We see some other pictures. The
following scene is it looks like

85fff4b9-1cd5-41e7-b1e9-da9c91458f9c-1
00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:23.965
someone is putting on rain boots
and then we see a hand extended

85fff4b9-1cd5-41e7-b1e9-da9c91458f9c-2
00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:27.750
down and we see this little
creature.

9d89b114-3388-4a7f-90d0-fd11fbbd8f69-0
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.520
In the lower left hand, looking
up.

4225db44-ad28-43ae-aa5a-43ef691d914d-0
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.480
And so it's handing through its
mouth the.

7497038c-e805-445b-af96-c5734ae01272-0
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:44.960
The girl's a stocking hat and
she puts it on and they go.

1d6baa8a-2306-49ac-838a-68d34c58c4f1-0
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.430
Outside down.

12b0e47f-892e-4da8-adab-eeb0466b531f-0
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.770
Stone staircase.

4eaae154-10a2-4c53-8c9b-760675256c22-0
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.620
And.

e8d65575-d106-4e90-bdca-cebbf55eadf6-0
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:05.366
Next to some houses they looks
like they're walking or running

e8d65575-d106-4e90-bdca-cebbf55eadf6-1
00:27:05.366 --> 00:27:06.470
and they.

808702c7-ad12-4c02-95d8-f8df220087c1-0
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:12.203

things. She's pointing on the

808702c7-ad12-4c02-95d8-f8df220087c1-1
00:27:12.203 --> 00:27:16.501
ground, the creature is
inspecting them, and then she

808702c7-ad12-4c02-95d8-f8df220087c1-2
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:21.275
holds her hand up as if she's
holding a ball of light or or

808702c7-ad12-4c02-95d8-f8df220087c1-3
00:27:21.275 --> 00:27:24.300
maybe a shiny star in the
background.

e24aaf83-9f81-4977-9b4d-5c5373b94a7d-0
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.678

have a 2 to 3 minute break, you

can now while I start to pull up
the next item.}

you.}

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.310
{So this is just a complex scene
like the ones we were doing

95fae700-4f1d-4da8-bddc-68878f2b713a-1
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.980
earlier. So just take 3 to 5
minutes to describe what you see

95fae700-4f1d-4da8-bddc-68878f2b713a-2
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.459
happening in this scene.}

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.410
{Wow.}

9243f335-ffd4-4efb-8621-c97d3aeb9f2d-0
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.556
#START_picture_this OK, to me it
looks like it is a very crowded

9243f335-ffd4-4efb-8621-c97d3aeb9f2d-1
00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:59.564
Art Museum. There are a lot of
paintings hanging on the wall

9243f335-ffd4-4efb-8621-c97d3aeb9f2d-2
00:32:59.564 --> 00:33:02.929
and they are on three different
stories.

59b3a7e1-5b7d-4e40-aab2-e78d4d3276dd-0
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.060
There.

65a85525-ed41-4f30-a256-4cd52b68b7d6-0
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.790
are

1151d3df-74ba-49a0-84e7-c972610cf4a0-0
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:13.941
The wall background is sort of
like a red clay color and there

1151d3df-74ba-49a0-84e7-c972610cf4a0-1
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:19.071
are a number of square
paintings. The one I I recognize

1151d3df-74ba-49a0-84e7-c972610cf4a0-2
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:24.384
on the 1st floor it looks like
that. It looks like just a

1151d3df-74ba-49a0-84e7-c972610cf4a0-3
00:33:24.384 --> 00:33:28.140
couple standing next to each
each other.

80bd6211-be52-40b5-9a76-5c1313bd9796-0
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.490
So the paintings.

49681738-eaac-41a3-adc3-fd0b0e38e3d3-0
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.020
They are, and they look like.

b9000fd9-ebf7-4b4c-a007-011bc9cb3707-0
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:42.456
People just portraits of of
people and there are some that

b9000fd9-ebf7-4b4c-a007-011bc9cb3707-1
00:33:42.456 --> 00:33:44.610
maybe it looks like a fish.

1a7f314c-13e9-4ff6-8e79-edd3e0a0c5b3-0
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:51.533
And there are just many, many
people. They're all crowded

1a7f314c-13e9-4ff6-8e79-edd3e0a0c5b3-1
00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:53.560
together. And they're.

2c8dd3e0-6b89-43f1-9f1c-b2c792c0978c-0
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:55.110
Going.

82e380e7-8571-420c-9440-8ae194e98c7f-0
00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:00.383
Up and down there's a there are
a couple of staircases or a

82e380e7-8571-420c-9440-8ae194e98c7f-1
00:34:00.383 --> 00:34:04.292
staircase leading from the
ground floor up to the second

82e380e7-8571-420c-9440-8ae194e98c7f-2
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:08.543
floor and from the 2nd floor up
to the third floor, and there

82e380e7-8571-420c-9440-8ae194e98c7f-3
00:34:08.543 --> 00:34:10.600
are people carrying paintings.

9218bec7-913c-4e2e-8945-ab27dc18bbed-0
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.270

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.537
#END_picture_this Either they're
buying them or maybe they're

00:34:19.537 --> 00:34:22.800
shopping. So that's that's
basically what I see.

00:36:09.815 --> 00:36:10.190
just?}

3a5a37e2-9854-42d7-b89f-e74f899c1802-0
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.080
{Is it on? I see there's.

6ac57e48-7db7-4cc8-8b5b-65b6336df228-0
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.410
6 frames and one frame. So is it
just?}

985b4179-e102-42a1-93dc-13512fcdb941-0
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:21.261
{Go on one page on the left page
and then the right page. Yep. So

985b4179-e102-42a1-93dc-13512fcdb941-1
00:36:21.261 --> 00:36:25.236
OK, for the most part, yeah,
it'll divide like this. Or it'll

985b4179-e102-42a1-93dc-13512fcdb941-2
00:36:25.236 --> 00:36:29.147
be like one big spread across
the page. OK, alright, got it.

985b4179-e102-42a1-93dc-13512fcdb941-3
00:36:29.147 --> 00:36:32.801
OK, alright. And this. }
#START_wanderer We see two male

985b4179-e102-42a1-93dc-13512fcdb941-4
00:36:32.801 --> 00:36:34.020
figures. There's a.

ed03f93e-1e20-4a39-ad21-405595fecc43-0
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:43.964
And it looks like they're
folding a tarp. And so one male

ed03f93e-1e20-4a39-ad21-405595fecc43-1
00:36:43.964 --> 00:36:52.631
is on his hands and knees where
the fold of the tarp is, and the

ed03f93e-1e20-4a39-ad21-405595fecc43-2
00:36:52.631 --> 00:37:01.032
other is standing. This guy's
wearing a striped shirt. Stripes

ed03f93e-1e20-4a39-ad21-405595fecc43-3
00:37:01.032 --> 00:37:06.099
go horizontally and he's got the
the.

cfebc7f3-e13f-4356-8148-b105ea83e749-0
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.406
And and he's standing on the
bottom of the tarp, so they're

cfebc7f3-e13f-4356-8148-b105ea83e749-1
00:37:10.406 --> 00:37:11.700
folding it in half.

07a75153-d486-4cbc-bbee-6744c0045b6b-0
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.000
And now

1b494458-ed85-4ad3-bdb2-925323e8a52f-0
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:23.275
They're folding the tarp into.
It looks like they're folding it

1b494458-ed85-4ad3-bdb2-925323e8a52f-1
00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:24.750
into like a.

6678adde-2ca3-421e-9595-0ff26d673317-0
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.268
Quarters now they're taking the
tarp and they're, oh, they've

6678adde-2ca3-421e-9595-0ff26d673317-1
00:37:31.268 --> 00:37:36.610
made a, they're folding it again
and they've made a type of.

6f3a81df-cb13-4af4-85e0-c12cfbf63eab-0
00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.590
It looks like a pyramid turned
on its side.

da0947b5-a01e-49ef-9b7a-9657a70a0a97-0
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.510
Next they take the the pyramid
and they pull.

71d3753e-fb31-478a-a951-c9f9765c73be-0
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:54.694
Some of the quarters, apart from
some of the corners apart from

71d3753e-fb31-478a-a951-c9f9765c73be-1
00:37:54.694 --> 00:37:59.017
it, and here they've made
themselves. It looks like a

71d3753e-fb31-478a-a951-c9f9765c73be-2
00:37:59.017 --> 00:38:01.820
paper sailboat that looks like a
a

b8295be2-25cd-48b7-ad25-8c3c5d65e499-0
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.470
A hat.

1dcd3d2b-fbbf-4e1c-bb46-f6fb81f38adc-0
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.000
And in the next scene we see a
large.

b6957dcc-3f70-488f-a5d7-c658c04247a5-0
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.100
Boat with.

ae66358e-c31c-4336-9f27-57559c3106b1-0
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.776
It looks like a bunch of
banners. I know it's. It's

ae66358e-c31c-4336-9f27-57559c3106b1-1
00:38:18.776 --> 00:38:21.290
probably a sail and it's it's.

1cee4f7e-192a-45f2-8837-2c836bea482b-0
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.260
It's sailing and.

48c0510c-4c37-4eca-ba76-228ca66f238a-0
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:30.870
At the bottom of the this boat
where we see the the water. The

48c0510c-4c37-4eca-ba76-228ca66f238a-1
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:35.000
water looks clear and there is
some type of.

dd33038f-7d1a-46dd-a96a-44c730064416-0
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.230
Device there that.

75abc95f-d170-4a17-a894-8379aaf71e08-0
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:45.105
Like a round device that someone
could sit in and perhaps go and

75abc95f-d170-4a17-a894-8379aaf71e08-1
00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:49.660
view underneath the water so it
looks like a.

04239727-b63e-4289-ad97-5ea4d1e4c95e-0
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.690
Type of device that allows them
to study the ocean of the sea.

3b81cf0f-32fe-4afe-bed1-1c7d81fda3f9-0
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.640
And there we see the and the and
the next one.

5fd35525-2195-4660-a901-895c21c2232e-0
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.040
{Go ahead. I'm done with that.}
And the next one we see.

9cc90108-bc79-4f53-866c-99939dbd17d2-0
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.599
Seagulls flying what must be
over the well. It's over the

9cc90108-bc79-4f53-866c-99939dbd17d2-1
00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:15.880
water. It looks like it's over
the water. We see the little.

190c5cd8-bb1f-412a-b0db-aef8b0a1672d-0
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:22.983
Little vessel that the two men
have built its in the water, the

190c5cd8-bb1f-412a-b0db-aef8b0a1672d-1
00:39:22.983 --> 00:39:28.536
water looks like the water caps
are are well it's, it's a, it's

190c5cd8-bb1f-412a-b0db-aef8b0a1672d-2
00:39:28.536 --> 00:39:28.710
a.

244849e2-f053-4111-8d1a-7dbf53e674ad-0
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.862
Black and white and Gray
painting and so it looks like

244849e2-f053-4111-8d1a-7dbf53e674ad-1
00:39:34.862 --> 00:39:37.890
the the the sea is is very Gray.

93271a2d-0ee4-4bcb-9be8-cc35f2732a87-0
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.580
And in this we see that.

2557c83b-2279-4768-99e7-67ded322c0ea-0
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.460
On the water we see a the.

97b8a932-40de-464e-a323-7d5c268e1251-0
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:59.158
The little boat that the men
have put out into the water, and

97b8a932-40de-464e-a323-7d5c268e1251-1
00:39:59.158 --> 00:40:03.507
there are some sea turtles who
are inspecting it and it looks

97b8a932-40de-464e-a323-7d5c268e1251-2
00:40:03.507 --> 00:40:07.786
like they've swam over to the to
the little boat and they're

97b8a932-40de-464e-a323-7d5c268e1251-3
00:40:07.786 --> 00:40:12.205
looking inside of it and there
are a couple. There's a seagull

97b8a932-40de-464e-a323-7d5c268e1251-4
00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:16.694
who's come and landed on it, and
there are three other seagulls

97b8a932-40de-464e-a323-7d5c268e1251-5
00:40:16.694 --> 00:40:19.640
flying overhead now to the right
of that.

f0f55fc0-2781-403c-ba7c-4f64919ec204-0
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.320
It looks like a.

ca0bfd9d-4658-4100-96fb-4ccf98130c7d-0
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.620
Umm.

bae50069-c076-4d0e-baed-b481cfe7b2e4-0
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:31.741
That little boat is either up
against a a sea creature that

bae50069-c076-4d0e-baed-b481cfe7b2e4-1
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:32.280
it's.

1d4aa6b2-879d-4108-b565-cfcf20897945-0
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:39.465
Over shadows it it's it's it's
many times bigger than the

1d4aa6b2-879d-4108-b565-cfcf20897945-1
00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:46.075
little both and it's got spots
all over it. So it's a a dark

1d4aa6b2-879d-4108-b565-cfcf20897945-2
00:40:46.075 --> 00:40:52.685
creature what looks like a horn
and then it's got some white

1d4aa6b2-879d-4108-b565-cfcf20897945-3
00:40:52.685 --> 00:40:55.069
spots all over it. OK.

6cf90dfa-0097-4dc4-993f-374d285aae51-0
00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:00.800
And then and and this we see
that the.

d5a96f1c-a9f2-4407-954d-2729080002f9-0
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:08.725
What it is, it looks like a an
an orca shark or an orca. Whale,

d5a96f1c-a9f2-4407-954d-2729080002f9-1
00:41:08.725 --> 00:41:15.169
I'm not sure what that that is.
And so now the little boat is on

d5a96f1c-a9f2-4407-954d-2729080002f9-2
00:41:15.169 --> 00:41:21.316
the top of its fin, and that's
what we saw earlier. So now we

d5a96f1c-a9f2-4407-954d-2729080002f9-3
00:41:21.316 --> 00:41:26.967
see the the the creature
underwater and we see other sea

d5a96f1c-a9f2-4407-954d-2729080002f9-4
00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:31.330
creatures there too. There it
looks like a.

cbb79c52-7510-4a07-b202-5123ce937865-0
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:38.982
Some kind of Marlin that's
coming out of a underwater

cbb79c52-7510-4a07-b202-5123ce937865-1
00:41:38.982 --> 00:41:46.010
flower and we see some other
vegetation and other types of

cbb79c52-7510-4a07-b202-5123ce937865-2
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:52.800
fish swimming around and in the
under underwater plants.

dd384677-939d-4b3b-8c0c-e2fd2f7dc643-0
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.524
And then we see a school of
smaller fish up at the top,

dd384677-939d-4b3b-8c0c-e2fd2f7dc643-1
00:41:59.524 --> 00:42:04.865
close to the close to the water,
where the water comes to the

dd384677-939d-4b3b-8c0c-e2fd2f7dc643-2
00:42:04.865 --> 00:42:05.210
air.

df1d49e2-0475-4eeb-aac5-bcf5537447b0-0
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:15.521
So this is a an even bigger view
of what we see. We see you know

df1d49e2-0475-4eeb-aac5-bcf5537447b0-1
00:42:15.521 --> 00:42:20.683
some coral, we see some reef, we
see a lot of fish swimming

df1d49e2-0475-4eeb-aac5-bcf5537447b0-2
00:42:20.683 --> 00:42:26.274
around at the at the surface of
the water and we we see a lot of

df1d49e2-0475-4eeb-aac5-bcf5537447b0-3
00:42:26.274 --> 00:42:30.490
activity of various types of
fish, striped fish.

436a0460-dede-40e8-9e36-c22c1e28eba6-0
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.820
We see some must be an eel or
some type of.

fb47af85-9d2d-47cc-9bc4-461ac784f05b-0
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:43.641
Serpent swimming underneath just
many, many schools of fish that

fb47af85-9d2d-47cc-9bc4-461ac784f05b-1
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:47.630
are swimming under the under the
sea.

e340730d-b057-410e-a5f2-9232882a7078-0
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:57.657
And here we see two pictures of
the on the the boat. So in in

e340730d-b057-410e-a5f2-9232882a7078-1
00:42:57.657 --> 00:43:00.380
the first picture we see that.

521938f4-6c14-43e4-96ed-68027b06c055-0
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:07.275
The boats on the surface and
there is a fish or some creature

521938f4-6c14-43e4-96ed-68027b06c055-1
00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:11.100
that is popped its top and it
looks like it's.

7601f4a0-f1f9-4d10-a44d-e45701fabe8c-0
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:18.610
Close to the close to the
surface, inspecting the boat and

7601f4a0-f1f9-4d10-a44d-e45701fabe8c-1
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:23.344
then underneath we see looks
like a couple of fish, or I

7601f4a0-f1f9-4d10-a44d-e45701fabe8c-2
00:43:23.344 --> 00:43:28.576
don't know if they're fish. They
looks like they have arms. It

7601f4a0-f1f9-4d10-a44d-e45701fabe8c-3
00:43:28.576 --> 00:43:33.725
looks like they have fish heads
and then bodies, sleek bodies

7601f4a0-f1f9-4d10-a44d-e45701fabe8c-4
00:43:33.725 --> 00:43:38.792
and and skinny little arms and
it looks like they're kissing

7601f4a0-f1f9-4d10-a44d-e45701fabe8c-5
00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:43.360
and they're in front of a large
plant under the water.

09c202ad-0259-4f6b-bb25-ef329e637679-0
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.910
And we see schools of fish.

77e5329b-d163-49bd-ac91-a5b8a896a422-0
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.110
Striped ones, speckled ones.
Ones.

7b657465-61bd-4971-9766-143576bf8a61-0
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:59.178
Just Gray ones just swimming
around and the next frame we see

7b657465-61bd-4971-9766-143576bf8a61-1
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:04.508
a fishing rod come out of the
little boat and it is fishing

7b657465-61bd-4971-9766-143576bf8a61-2
00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:10.194
and it looks like it's caught a
fish and the other fish are you

7b657465-61bd-4971-9766-143576bf8a61-3
00:44:10.194 --> 00:44:15.525
know couple of fish are looking
at it and so this, this one

7b657465-61bd-4971-9766-143576bf8a61-4
00:44:15.525 --> 00:44:17.479
looks like one of the.

986bec1d-48a7-4380-9f8e-b2979218351a-0
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:24.995
Creatures with a fish head and
then a body, and in its hand

986bec1d-48a7-4380-9f8e-b2979218351a-1
00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:28.150
it's holding a pair of scissors.

495f0271-b120-43b0-8319-c31f89abe5ae-0
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.347
So in this next frame we see
that there's a fish out of the

495f0271-b120-43b0-8319-c31f89abe5ae-1
00:44:40.347 --> 00:44:45.520
water, and on top of it is a
little creature.

65683012-6353-40fe-b3c2-cd71894fa381-0
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:52.101
Wearing a hat that looks like
the little fishing vessel that

65683012-6353-40fe-b3c2-cd71894fa381-1
00:44:52.101 --> 00:44:55.080
the men created earlier. And so
this.

a101a2c5-c755-4f4b-a97b-be4274ec3457-0
00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:01.720
Creature is standing on a fish,
the fish, and looks like it's

a101a2c5-c755-4f4b-a97b-be4274ec3457-1
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:07.480
perched itself on some on on a
on a coral. Underneath the water

a101a2c5-c755-4f4b-a97b-be4274ec3457-2
00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:13.060
and in the foreground we see
some other curious striped fish.

04a869b1-3321-4100-97b9-b6a7dd3abc5a-0
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.770
A different types of stripes and
another fish looking up.

691394f6-8b16-485b-9c95-c841f01b284b-0
00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:24.256
And in the following scene we
see that creature that was above

691394f6-8b16-485b-9c95-c841f01b284b-1
00:45:24.256 --> 00:45:26.540
the water has gotten into the.

81ca0072-e3cc-40f0-b7fe-5d39829eef08-0
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:34.046
Into the little boat and we see
a lion or holes or something

81ca0072-e3cc-40f0-b7fe-5d39829eef08-1
00:45:34.046 --> 00:45:40.298
coming out of the boat and down
to the floor of the sea and

81ca0072-e3cc-40f0-b7fe-5d39829eef08-2
00:45:40.298 --> 00:45:40.820
it's.

a530d609-6e96-4786-96b9-2b10f3266577-0
00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:49.618
And in the sea we see a bunch of
books like manta of Gray and

a530d609-6e96-4786-96b9-2b10f3266577-1
00:45:49.618 --> 00:45:52.830
speckled and white manta rays.

a4945722-e201-45f6-977d-c5a78423590b-0
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:02.219
Here we see the little boat in
the foreground, in the middle,

a4945722-e201-45f6-977d-c5a78423590b-1
00:46:02.219 --> 00:46:03.930
at the bottom of the page.

9daafc6e-75de-48fc-9f95-c2ee58339988-0
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:09.373
Kind of on the water and we see
some type of little plants or

9daafc6e-75de-48fc-9f95-c2ee58339988-1
00:46:09.373 --> 00:46:12.950
something coming out, maybe it's
on the ground now.

80b60382-08bb-46d6-a509-8055fd9b93df-0
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.190
And above that we see what it
looks like are.

b73efbb3-0746-426b-bc16-919450ff4d29-0
00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:19.570
Umm.

93334e91-5a65-403e-ac79-0f818bc5a84c-0
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.760
It looks like bushes.

ce9d609a-f07f-444b-ad00-8d86a55b2ae8-0
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:25.660
And sort.

04154ab7-d4de-408a-9040-885b80a8b394-0
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.010
To me that looks like they're
they're either a little zygote

04154ab7-d4de-408a-9040-885b80a8b394-1
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:34.190
swing down or they're that they
look like.

936c3213-d8bc-404e-9127-c76e97cd1422-0
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.860
Storks.

b3edf6dd-e3e1-4ff1-b685-d2dc4a750c88-0
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:42.257
Or those cranes that that are in
the in the bushes all over the

b3edf6dd-e3e1-4ff1-b685-d2dc4a750c88-1
00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:42.870
bushes.

a0df8267-d029-409a-85e1-24d93df39326-0
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.110
And.

78e014e1-56a1-4b3a-a503-0bc17125d692-0
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.434
I don't know what they're doing,
but they're just, there's a

78e014e1-56a1-4b3a-a503-0bc17125d692-1
00:46:50.434 --> 00:46:51.050
bunch of them.

453427ae-59d3-46f8-9f2b-e32d70998961-0
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:52.780
OK.

516ad910-a406-45eb-a6ca-5e6c624df7ae-0
00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:00.640
All right, this is a picture of.

16cfe26f-2273-49cf-9237-c986c70f6e02-0
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:07.240
Of water, under under the water
and above the water, under the

16cfe26f-2273-49cf-9237-c986c70f6e02-1
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.640
water we see some.

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-0
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:14.292
Various types of striped fish
and white fish swimming around.

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-1
00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:18.938
We see some dark Gray fish with
white eyes swimming in the

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-2
00:47:18.938 --> 00:47:23.427
opposite direction of them.
Above those fish we see this

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-3
00:47:23.427 --> 00:47:28.073
little, this little boat out of
the water is sticking some

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-4
00:47:28.073 --> 00:47:33.113
plants. There's some trees, some
sticking out and there there's

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-5
00:47:33.113 --> 00:47:37.996
like a, a, a Bush with with its
roots stuck down into the sea

c1bad802-783e-4481-8b0b-5883074f7d0d-6
00:47:37.996 --> 00:47:39.650
floor and these roots

32556a32-193b-4132-bea7-211d73ae37a8-0
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:49.329
Many like stringy roots and then
above that it we have some type

32556a32-193b-4132-bea7-211d73ae37a8-1
00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:53.440
of we have those those cranes
or.

f9dda487-73c0-4cd6-a17c-19c0ba53a708-0
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.700
Storks there are.

968ea0d9-d9ed-47bb-a0dc-ccf4ec74bddc-0
00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.164
They're in the Bush and there
are other several other bushes

968ea0d9-d9ed-47bb-a0dc-ccf4ec74bddc-1
00:48:02.164 --> 00:48:07.027
there. And then to the to the
left, sticking out of the water

968ea0d9-d9ed-47bb-a0dc-ccf4ec74bddc-2
00:48:07.027 --> 00:48:11.420
are some plants that may start
to look like palm trees.

b77e70a4-d163-4b54-8d90-e8daab0c1827-0
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:23.111
OK, in this picture it's a dark
picture and it may be at night.

b77e70a4-d163-4b54-8d90-e8daab0c1827-1
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:28.409
It looks like it's at night, and
it has in the foreground a

b77e70a4-d163-4b54-8d90-e8daab0c1827-2
00:48:28.409 --> 00:48:32.029
number of tree branches and tree
trunks.

e6e2c42d-6646-40ee-a713-5d699d45a3fe-0
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.450
As.

17f09d28-0eee-4e17-b885-db955153bf90-0
00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.050
Sticking up

42534d8b-b9ae-4f67-a661-c6fb01d80e26-0
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:42.510
And then in the branches it
looks like some type of.

c50347f8-e908-4e85-9e04-428161ccdbb4-0
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:47.220
Birds that are sitting on the
branches. Or maybe they're.

987f8467-d9d3-4c94-bfa4-cb8c9fb8a23b-0
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:54.075
Possum or something that's
sitting on on another on another

987f8467-d9d3-4c94-bfa4-cb8c9fb8a23b-1
00:48:54.075 --> 00:48:59.286
branch and there and some of
them are inspecting this little

987f8467-d9d3-4c94-bfa4-cb8c9fb8a23b-2
00:48:59.286 --> 00:49:04.411
boat. And then the boat is a
little creature, looks like an

987f8467-d9d3-4c94-bfa4-cb8c9fb8a23b-3
00:49:04.411 --> 00:49:10.049
alligator, a tiny alligator with
a striped body suit or checkered

987f8467-d9d3-4c94-bfa4-cb8c9fb8a23b-4
00:49:10.049 --> 00:49:11.160
body suit on.

5bc1e4dc-6943-4569-a337-b04982fd70f5-0
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.480
OK. And this we see the little
boat again.

1465843d-5363-49b9-a996-a34f9ade8500-0
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.850
And.

fde9e352-84d9-4759-ae46-d0d3df7b0572-0
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:28.602
Twice. It appears twice in this
in this picture and the little

fde9e352-84d9-4759-ae46-d0d3df7b0572-1
00:49:28.602 --> 00:49:32.300
oh, I see what it is looks like
now a seahorse.

09a650e4-de5b-455b-b001-79abf02d50aa-0
00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:38.391
So the seahorse is by itself on
the left hand side of the

09a650e4-de5b-455b-b001-79abf02d50aa-1
00:49:38.391 --> 00:49:42.080
picture, looking down into the
water at some.

24dbeaed-bbd7-4c5b-8e47-29ba585c6a6d-0
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.960
Other sea creature that that's.

10862c85-5f3f-4159-9e97-e029c80d3ee6-0
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:54.615
Riding a crab or lobster maybe.
And then on the right hand side

10862c85-5f3f-4159-9e97-e029c80d3ee6-1
00:49:54.615 --> 00:49:56.360
of that we see.

0af43931-7af2-4986-a5ef-4604b0bf8cf9-0
00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.670
That little.

64fac2d8-f5be-4e57-9041-a033b04229d9-0
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.391
A seahorse above the water, sort
of in the air, looks like it's

64fac2d8-f5be-4e57-9041-a033b04229d9-1
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:08.770
it's jumped out of the boat,
it's hat came flying off and

64fac2d8-f5be-4e57-9041-a033b04229d9-2
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:13.602
it's I'm looking at three other
sea horses who have their heads

64fac2d8-f5be-4e57-9041-a033b04229d9-3
00:50:13.602 --> 00:50:14.810
stuck above the.

d0d3a5fb-aeb6-4d9b-93ac-c07e0d14d808-0
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:22.593
Stuck above the surface of the
water and in some type of plant

d0d3a5fb-aeb6-4d9b-93ac-c07e0d14d808-1
00:50:22.593 --> 00:50:28.160
and we we have some solid dark
fish and some striped fish.

65f458d9-e5d6-483c-a51b-0cfab1f33981-0
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.220
It's like a herring bone type of
pattern on them.

39622b0f-5442-4418-8ace-7e9a7332254e-0
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.330
OK, so that's what I see.

0d418f1d-ddbf-44a7-92af-147bd4d19780-0
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.670
OK and this we see on the left
hand side you see a a whale not

0d418f1d-ddbf-44a7-92af-147bd4d19780-1
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.460
really sure what kind it is it's
it's body is.

c1df197b-9330-49e7-b8d6-7500e24b78fa-0
00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:58.218
A dark color and its belly is a
white with stripes on it and

c1df197b-9330-49e7-b8d6-7500e24b78fa-1
00:50:58.218 --> 00:50:59.770
it's got its head.

f200fd11-28d6-4355-b0d3-74545d0e73b6-0
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.600
Sticking out of the surface of
the sea and its body is.

62018d60-f640-4d18-b0f6-862c26137eb7-0
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.790
Underneath the sea.

aa8feac9-a184-488f-9f4f-cd0be9ad39f4-0
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:09.500
And.

76be5fb2-c375-4ec7-bd47-793d86848a16-0
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.580
And there are some fish.

3cf6a53d-0122-4255-8d1e-2da9d16f5626-0
00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:18.610
Swimming around to its right and
it looked like it's casting a

3cf6a53d-0122-4255-8d1e-2da9d16f5626-1
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:20.210
shadow. There's some.

6b9fdf63-c4a2-4096-aa35-442d6c00728f-0
00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.890
Looks like a shadow effect there
and the next picture we see.

78c36d1a-7d43-478b-94f8-e0148933be9e-0
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:30.384
Another creature with its head
above the water. It looks like

78c36d1a-7d43-478b-94f8-e0148933be9e-1
00:51:30.384 --> 00:51:31.880
it's got some kind of.

8adff7b4-a7a7-409c-b1a6-2b2b0834e4c6-0
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:39.155
Pepper or something sticking
from its its forehead and that

8adff7b4-a7a7-409c-b1a6-2b2b0834e4c6-1
00:51:39.155 --> 00:51:44.070
little boat appears in that
picture. It also appears in the

8adff7b4-a7a7-409c-b1a6-2b2b0834e4c6-2
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:49.230
first one, but more prominently
in this one. And it looks like

8adff7b4-a7a7-409c-b1a6-2b2b0834e4c6-3
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.050
this is a.

8a965279-cf27-4724-8865-c8afbeb44c13-0
00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:56.563
Creature that's long, it's got
legs and little arms that look

8a965279-cf27-4724-8865-c8afbeb44c13-1
00:51:56.563 --> 00:52:01.954
like lobster claws, and it looks
like it's looking at this boat

8a965279-cf27-4724-8865-c8afbeb44c13-2
00:52:01.954 --> 00:52:03.050
with delight.

b2d8f2f7-fb31-40d0-84fe-0d12210cdf91-0
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:10.397
It's got on its back, it's got
like octopus tentacles and it's

b2d8f2f7-fb31-40d0-84fe-0d12210cdf91-1
00:52:10.397 --> 00:52:16.230
standing on top of a looks like
wreckage of other boats.

b127a929-86ea-4373-b7a8-77e05afc1be5-0
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.960
So in this picture we see the
sea.

0e8c0d6a-f058-4c13-86a6-536941fba60d-0
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:28.280
Uh.

745a86b2-ada6-4a0f-80df-3eb9855d8f74-0
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:34.885
And we see the little boat and
looks like there's a cat that's

745a86b2-ada6-4a0f-80df-3eb9855d8f74-1
00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:40.352
jumping into the boat and the
sky is filled with butterflies

745a86b2-ada6-4a0f-80df-3eb9855d8f74-2
00:52:40.352 --> 00:52:46.176
and other and birds. And we see
fish out of the water and we see

745a86b2-ada6-4a0f-80df-3eb9855d8f74-3
00:52:46.176 --> 00:52:51.912
various types of sea creatures
out of the water jumping perhaps

745a86b2-ada6-4a0f-80df-3eb9855d8f74-4
00:52:51.912 --> 00:52:57.557
back into the water. And we see
a sea creatures that look like

745a86b2-ada6-4a0f-80df-3eb9855d8f74-5
00:52:57.557 --> 00:52:59.350
cheetahs and zebras.

cc04d34c-717e-4915-9dda-8f3d78ddad7d-0
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:03.630
Elephants and giraffes and.

3446c5fc-95c2-4ba5-b8d7-09329c672622-0
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.926
Things like that. And then we
see some type of sea creature in

3446c5fc-95c2-4ba5-b8d7-09329c672622-1
00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:15.221
the background, looks like the
sun is either coming up or

3446c5fc-95c2-4ba5-b8d7-09329c672622-2
00:53:15.221 --> 00:53:19.814
setting and it's swimming along
in front of that. And then it

3446c5fc-95c2-4ba5-b8d7-09329c672622-3
00:53:19.814 --> 00:53:24.554
looks like there's a planet up
in the right hand corner, but it

3446c5fc-95c2-4ba5-b8d7-09329c672622-4
00:53:24.554 --> 00:53:26.480
could be a a big blowfish.

1aaae379-c732-42ba-b467-facf201c85fb-0
00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.340
All right. And this scene it's
a.

1d8444ca-0ee1-4e20-8d87-e61b1091abd2-0
00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:39.860
A scene at night, the moon is.

d16905fb-407b-419f-abea-e89e264cb5dd-0
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.810


5680b792-67c0-406d-b1bf-952f1069b2ff-0
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:44.830
It's just a Crescent moon.

2fd2127b-b6bd-4a87-b303-57767fb65aae-0
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:51.247
And so it's a starry night with
some clouds. It looks like some

2fd2127b-b6bd-4a87-b303-57767fb65aae-1
00:53:51.247 --> 00:53:57.094
clouds there or something in the
sky along with the with the the

2fd2127b-b6bd-4a87-b303-57767fb65aae-2
00:53:57.094 --> 00:54:02.402
stars. The little boat is
floating on the water underneath

2fd2127b-b6bd-4a87-b303-57767fb65aae-3
00:54:02.402 --> 00:54:07.530
it are like this many fish
schools of fish and that that

2fd2127b-b6bd-4a87-b303-57767fb65aae-4
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.159
create.

15d37688-d0cb-4c70-9849-cd4f908d29e7-0
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.310
Sort of Arc like an arc like
effect under the water.

cfebe366-5c75-4add-83ec-9b95ec8db13e-0
00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:22.901
And in this, it's a picture of
the little boat and it's

cfebe366-5c75-4add-83ec-9b95ec8db13e-1
00:54:22.901 --> 00:54:29.160
surrounded by some type of fish.
They're they're all the same and

cfebe366-5c75-4add-83ec-9b95ec8db13e-2
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.670
they're all looking at the boat
and.

2e899bf7-ad52-47a8-9276-69b3035a3925-0
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:38.182
There are there's got to be,
hundreds of fish in this

2e899bf7-ad52-47a8-9276-69b3035a3925-1
00:54:38.182 --> 00:54:38.850
picture.

abbb70b1-ba39-4331-a2a7-78e9cf5e32d6-0
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.355
Right. And this again, it's a
night scene. I'm a little boat

abbb70b1-ba39-4331-a2a7-78e9cf5e32d6-1
00:54:47.355 --> 00:54:51.600
is on the water and then it
looks like the Aurora borealis.

1a209523-7af8-405a-9eab-501095a515ac-0
00:54:56.330 --> 00:55:02.616
And this scene is an ocean scene
with a little boat in the

1a209523-7af8-405a-9eab-501095a515ac-1
00:55:02.616 --> 00:55:04.960
foreground and a huge.

7c451cfc-c1ee-4cd9-960d-58b83f7f7dd7-0
00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:10.370
Iceberg in the background, it's
got a plateau to it.

6da2ca63-e249-4e1a-9f2e-40b4e9cf8b07-0
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:23.073
OK, and this we have the picture
on the left is a a night scene

6da2ca63-e249-4e1a-9f2e-40b4e9cf8b07-1
00:55:23.073 --> 00:55:28.906
and it looks to me like it. The
little boat is in the foreground

6da2ca63-e249-4e1a-9f2e-40b4e9cf8b07-2
00:55:28.906 --> 00:55:31.240
and it is going through a.

a1ed55cb-d9a9-4a67-b4d2-90e6acae7ec9-0
00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:32.550
Ohh.

084b2d81-d6c6-421d-81b7-0eda108b9f15-0
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:38.476
An iceberg that has been formed
with a like a cut out in it. In

084b2d81-d6c6-421d-81b7-0eda108b9f15-1
00:55:38.476 --> 00:55:40.740
the background of that are some.

0c55a5c1-cfd4-4a0f-bcce-80eda7e94d57-0
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:45.520
Mountains. Or it could be that
they're.

620d26bd-c5af-4099-9803-b7fafa79f5d6-0
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.210
Yeah, there are ice cap
mountains.

a07eea4c-e2ec-45c6-b26f-2815b55aa31b-0
00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:55.932
And in the next picture, oh, I
didn't get to that. In the next

a07eea4c-e2ec-45c6-b26f-2815b55aa31b-1
00:55:55.932 --> 00:55:58.600
picture it looks like a cavern
of.

5f9873d4-9432-4446-8ab6-0fab08555f05-0
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:03.991
Of the ice formed with the cut
out in the middle, and the

5f9873d4-9432-4446-8ab6-0fab08555f05-1
00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:07.870
little boat is sort of sailing
through the cavern.

c8439ff4-52ab-47ae-a88c-69233ce04aa0-0
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:17.946
And this we see it's again an
ice. Excuse me, it's a little

c8439ff4-52ab-47ae-a88c-69233ce04aa0-1
00:56:17.946 --> 00:56:19.580
boat is on the.

7ba9a2ff-8c8f-4136-981c-97a4e6f5d2b9-0
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.149
Water, but it looks like it's
right underneath it is some type

7ba9a2ff-8c8f-4136-981c-97a4e6f5d2b9-1
00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:26.370
of.

d9b36257-e136-4ffa-9983-70a5524e828a-0
00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:34.692
Either sea creature or or maybe
it's it's a manta with a tail on

d9b36257-e136-4ffa-9983-70a5524e828a-1
00:56:34.692 --> 00:56:41.132
it and it's standing next. It's
it's a floating next to what

d9b36257-e136-4ffa-9983-70a5524e828a-2
00:56:41.132 --> 00:56:47.361
looks like a huge iceberg.
Iceberg looks like the leg of a

d9b36257-e136-4ffa-9983-70a5524e828a-3
00:56:47.361 --> 00:56:49.790
man with wearing boots.

caf8f055-fc05-4a59-83ab-3ac8f593b758-0
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:54.160
And then the next scene we see
a.

62c16b03-5e0c-4519-a81c-d677b50ebc5c-0
00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:58.970
We see.

496fd969-369a-4b8f-bee2-5d9cf4a968d5-0
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.780
Emerging out of the water.

8e2c6052-fdaf-4561-bdf2-7a2b9fa0144f-0
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:10.902
The man or creature, or it's a
creature wearing some kind of

8e2c6052-fdaf-4561-bdf2-7a2b9fa0144f-1
00:57:10.902 --> 00:57:14.410
backpack and hoses and it's.

051f4d52-9d97-4662-a99a-3d57751f1109-0
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:21.323
Holding this little boat and it
looks like it's holding it under

051f4d52-9d97-4662-a99a-3d57751f1109-1
00:57:21.323 --> 00:57:26.723
a light and the light looks like
a shower head, flexible shower

051f4d52-9d97-4662-a99a-3d57751f1109-2
00:57:26.723 --> 00:57:31.616
head and shining down and and
it's got a number 08 on its

051f4d52-9d97-4662-a99a-3d57751f1109-3
00:57:31.616 --> 00:57:35.160
head. So that makes me think
that it's a.

00c7e683-2453-4b3c-b126-668bfe2040ee-0
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:41.102
Like probably a person coming
down and then there's another

00c7e683-2453-4b3c-b126-668bfe2040ee-1
00:57:41.102 --> 00:57:46.130
smaller one underwater with a 05
on its on its head, OK.

c5aaae5f-3485-4e34-bded-a60f0afb9888-0
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:55.224
OK. And this scene again, it's
on the ocean and the little boat

c5aaae5f-3485-4e34-bded-a60f0afb9888-1
00:57:55.224 --> 00:57:59.570
is in the lower left hand corner
and it it looks like it's.

af850100-b8d9-4e32-bf17-d387bf51ed28-0
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:08.145
Next to a huge ocean liner or
several huge ships that are

af850100-b8d9-4e32-bf17-d387bf51ed28-1
00:58:08.145 --> 00:58:11.530
sailing and they seem to have a.

846c2652-6aef-4cd0-8388-632d8cec6c4d-0
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:13.530
Uh.

7804a6e4-2e4f-4f17-90d9-3e350838f50f-0
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.661
Like trees or leaves or
something protruding from the

7804a6e4-2e4f-4f17-90d9-3e350838f50f-1
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:22.589
from the top of the one and the
other one looks like just the

7804a6e4-2e4f-4f17-90d9-3e350838f50f-2
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:23.349
modern ship.

7defee65-882e-44c5-b927-8236cc6f7f9d-0
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.270
OK.

6607d579-8855-4c5d-b398-fdd8a45e1690-0
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:33.437
And then this we see again a
water scene. The little boat is

6607d579-8855-4c5d-b398-fdd8a45e1690-1
00:58:33.437 --> 00:58:38.426
on the lower left hand side just
floating around a lot of

6607d579-8855-4c5d-b398-fdd8a45e1690-2
00:58:38.426 --> 00:58:43.759
seagulls flying over the over
the ocean and on the right hand

6607d579-8855-4c5d-b398-fdd8a45e1690-3
00:58:43.759 --> 00:58:45.910
side looks like now like.

3e330ea1-1db9-42b7-9db6-cee44d30f77c-0
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.050
A structure that's.

21d4488c-5722-48bf-9ec2-e279fadb89b0-0
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.950
Sticking out of the ocean sort
of like a A.

261cd1f9-1b7a-409e-8809-49e04fbb491d-0
00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:01.893
Where they can drill for oil at
the bottom of the ocean at a big

261cd1f9-1b7a-409e-8809-49e04fbb491d-1
00:59:01.893 --> 00:59:08.070
rig and so it looks like that's
in the ocean and maybe there's

261cd1f9-1b7a-409e-8809-49e04fbb491d-2
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:12.089
smoke or puppy clowns coming out

Of this device out of this
structure.

And this we have two pictures,
and the one on the left. There

1d6d23b8-fe57-43b9-8dcf-9d0b8aa884d6-1

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:39.828
Sharp lines or lasers or
something coming out of it. The

00:59:39.828 --> 00:59:42.810

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:48.868
And then there's a chain that
comes down in the background

488953a9-d07c-409e-9043-fb9c4be2bfab-1
00:59:48.868 --> 00:59:54.377
with a claw, like it's coming
down to grab something. And then

488953a9-d07c-409e-9043-fb9c4be2bfab-2
00:59:54.377 --> 00:59:59.624

Boat and looks like he's trying
to stay afloat. And then on the
