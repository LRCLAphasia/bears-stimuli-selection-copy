00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:20.380
the kids.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.300
And then I see a girl sitting on
a.

35018b4b-9984-4c28-9505-5430204903cd-0
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.319
Sitting on the stairs, lonely as
if she is going through some

35018b4b-9984-4c28-9505-5430204903cd-1
00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.640
stress condition or some
overthinking.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.034
And on the other hand of the
picture I could see a person

236514ee-1691-4582-90c9-5b409ce5c5ec-1
00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:50.993

room.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.030
Then there's a woman in the
kitchen who's cooking.

e6a4dcb6-971d-49f6-a940-c0d9c534840e-0
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.880
Food.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.170
Or a lunch for her kids, maybe.

7bb1d881-e83e-4671-bb17-5b3d4de103f8-0
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.952
And then I also see a girl
sitting on a couch, focusing on

7bb1d881-e83e-4671-bb17-5b3d4de103f8-1
00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:13.770
her mobile phone and spending
some screen time.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.390
I think that's it about the
picture.

1c58345e-839d-4aae-b4d5-0412ae072253-0
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.850
So in this picture I see a
woman.

519c36fa-e0ca-472d-a249-cbd617bf2c7b-0
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.740
A mom cooking.

45db968f-110a-4ede-a97f-30c649f9e6cb-0
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.610
In the kitchen and her kid is.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.270
With her.

1d8f5a52-a370-46cc-b932-f55343c1ec86-0
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.780
One wheel.

1e4542a0-9f16-4079-858f-3eb413eaf9dc-0
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.720
One wheel bike inside the
kitchen.

b736dfe0-6ab8-49b5-afe9-664f1aa7c203-0
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.480
And then I can also see a
daughter, you know.

6474176f-2e29-4823-a8db-52cf77ed54b8-0
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.596
A daughter troubling her father
who is working from home on the

6474176f-2e29-4823-a8db-52cf77ed54b8-1
00:03:58.596 --> 00:03:59.890
computer system.

09c5b648-6623-4b65-9684-51021c708a29-0
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.790
During his office hours.

b6dd8dac-446a-4659-a96b-5db96249554e-0
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.020
And then I see a daughter.

ff20d62a-a796-4ead-bb85-2c917f94558d-0
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.790
Feeling monotonous while her
mother is.

99956c79-7d93-4c3d-9f13-64635dd0843f-0
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.670
Spending time on the screen and
sitting on a couch.

aa691dbd-6ffa-4003-baf1-c2ad7d95e44d-0
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.681
And then on the other hand, I
see a girl who is very much

aa691dbd-6ffa-4003-baf1-c2ad7d95e44d-1
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:26.484
tired and her cat is sleeping on
the floor. She's not even paying

aa691dbd-6ffa-4003-baf1-c2ad7d95e44d-2
00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:29.250
attention on her or playing with
her.

3fe2ac30-33e2-4a36-9d11-47e066188566-0
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.672
She is too tired after coming
back from school and then giving

3fe2ac30-33e2-4a36-9d11-47e066188566-1
00:04:34.672 --> 00:04:36.630
just giving a nap to herself.

23c2a63e-0afb-4cef-8284-3d93333e5a62-0
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.655
OK so in this picture I see that
girls cat is going out from the

23c2a63e-0afb-4cef-8284-3d93333e5a62-1
00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:54.630
room and.

046865eb-ded8-498a-b6a8-150091c2720e-0
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.020
All of the papers are spread on
the floor.

a32a6315-78e4-414e-8620-5411e7f4ba6d-0
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.350
And the girl, on the other hand,
is cleaning the wall.

ceaf5141-eee7-484f-b492-bdb77322addb-0
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.627
And using those papers to Draw
Something or to paint something

ceaf5141-eee7-484f-b492-bdb77322addb-1
00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:14.560
on the wall with her colors.

9b6fd15f-54e9-4301-aac1-3b6ef6bce39b-0
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.120
Next.

98229ab7-9039-4274-aa90-e52f24c729ad-0
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.582
So I see a girl coming out of
the door of his house and she

98229ab7-9039-4274-aa90-e52f24c729ad-1
00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:39.287
has entered into a pathway where
you where you see the lights,

98229ab7-9039-4274-aa90-e52f24c729ad-2
00:05:39.287 --> 00:05:41.369
lanterns and the trees.

29e89143-ea15-4d93-b5bc-027c93e303b9-0
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.970
It more look like.

d160450e-843d-479c-846b-5df97b87af77-0
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.430
Painting domain which she wanted
to draw on the wall.

2cd95c6c-d3ba-410b-a3e3-a851e2559389-0
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.900
That's it.

be496b5a-8044-4c06-8bc8-d10107d5da5e-0
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.570
So this is a painting.

adaf2321-6534-47b0-8ebc-59e812bcf96e-0
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.270
In which

a804698c-9cd6-47c9-b5cd-0dd7271ca1e5-0
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.400
Girl from the bed.

97cc11ab-60de-4cbc-bf90-a0e1b0aa78f3-0
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.750
Not from the bed is, you know,
trying to draw a boat.

cef47869-0dab-4e1d-847b-45fbf66cd915-0
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.096
So that which can be a boat or a
ship which can sail in the water

cef47869-0dab-4e1d-847b-45fbf66cd915-1
00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:29.160
and she can get take a ride in
the in this.

870227dc-cc24-425b-94b5-6168bf34c174-0
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.030
Uh, in this ship?

6e35bf8c-3692-4f47-bab4-8e86c6a277a7-0
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.910
To go somewhere and explore her
leisure time.

93fb9220-cf10-49e9-b1c4-d053344f1463-0
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.060
Then, on the other hand, there
is a boy standing on the.

1531d752-a7f4-46e3-9fd0-f09e61f041ae-0
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.850
Wooden plank.

db4d02bd-a249-4331-81a3-a83a6eb29269-0
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.460
Which is made on the river. A
river is flowing.

68d15251-d978-4c6f-adcc-6645c62b12e4-0
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.003
With a heavy tide water and
there are trees along the sides

68d15251-d978-4c6f-adcc-6645c62b12e4-1
00:06:58.003 --> 00:06:59.120
of the river.

f9f9c90c-f968-4326-8e6c-766918394deb-0
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.510
next

88dabf0c-e34c-44e2-aa5c-0277022b5892-0
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.955
So this picture looks like a
huge monument or an ancient

88dabf0c-e34c-44e2-aa5c-0277022b5892-1
00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:11.710
building.

b4ea198e-acc3-4643-99e1-891a8e9ba751-0
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.290
Which is next to the riverbank.

b8bbeda0-a566-40ee-bc32-6413a0536478-0
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.990
And I can see the boat.

00c38805-ef66-4d9f-ae12-727061c292e3-0
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.126
Or a ship in which the girl is
sitting and going to enter to

00c38805-ef66-4d9f-ae12-727061c292e3-1
00:07:26.126 --> 00:07:28.630
visit this historical building.

8307cd4c-2696-4a0a-953c-ae67ee9cf379-0
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.991
So the girl on the ship, she
she's now welcomed in that

8307cd4c-2696-4a0a-953c-ae67ee9cf379-1
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:41.320
building by the.

deb2625e-6a7e-4780-b78e-1ca1c3c89028-0
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.590
Persons who belong to this
ancient building.

6866552a-b14c-4d7f-826d-a125322bc1ee-0
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.670
And they are.

a27d3943-0d74-423d-9bde-2811cfd64e5d-0
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.400
They are welcoming her with a
smile.

0c20bf81-c247-416c-a885-8e7f48ef2b0d-0
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.710
On their face, faces.

8900417b-2f2d-4ae8-a911-c12be33e290e-0
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.870
It feels like that.

067b9a41-7a1b-491c-bfe4-82857f9f9060-0
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.739
That she was supposed to be here
and they invited her for some

067b9a41-7a1b-491c-bfe4-82857f9f9060-1
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:09.610
event in the.

b563de1c-f77a-4557-bcea-35a8c4b82873-0
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.190
In this ancient building. That's
it.

3b1c98b1-ac70-44af-a546-f8f7486eda7e-0
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.420
OK.

a86d8983-b922-4724-ade4-30f995365789-0
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.700
So this looks like that there
has been a flood in that build

a86d8983-b922-4724-ade4-30f995365789-1
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.990
in this ancient building and her
there is a water broke.

0db4fbd0-2de3-48c2-8a61-4bcd7fbde45c-0
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.060
And the girl fell off from the
height.

73cdf043-80a1-4cb9-8390-d19b40a4df7a-0
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.980
Into the water and the girl and
the two other two girls and one

73cdf043-80a1-4cb9-8390-d19b40a4df7a-1
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.303
boy. They are trying to save
each other if they could while

73cdf043-80a1-4cb9-8390-d19b40a4df7a-2
00:08:55.303 --> 00:08:56.239
in the water.

77096f91-9e89-4a44-98fc-c750c836bace-0
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.860
Because they were drowning.

9a605fa6-1f70-43b1-84cd-fa7fd943d86d-0
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.230
Yes.

423ed567-1479-4fd4-95d4-cfb9087f2d48-0
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:11.346
OK, so someone came from the
parachute to help or rescue

423ed567-1479-4fd4-95d4-cfb9087f2d48-1
00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:14.260
those children from the water.

36c5ed15-bae2-4268-aeb6-551d43221f61-0
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:21.780
And we can also see some giant
vehicle in the sky.

ed9a7da1-dbfe-405f-8eda-8d64727a2c95-0
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.130
And there is a bird. Looks like
an eagle to me.

bf29feaa-b589-4b5f-aeb4-69e485154eff-0
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.240
Next.

c2f91fad-cc6e-447f-9c73-e1a1b1ab93a3-0
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.810
So the girl has been saved in
that parachute.

093f0e68-06b7-461c-82a4-6163f2538d33-0
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.180
And now the.

c8ddcd32-e5f1-4463-8015-2d3cdf3303f1-0
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.840
The two persons who are in.

e0647abd-4896-4475-acab-3b205d56f781-0
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.279
In that spacecraft kind of
thing, which is not exactly a

e0647abd-4896-4475-acab-3b205d56f781-1
00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:01.150
spacecraft.

4b0031fc-6f9b-4eb0-81dd-aea8119f9f99-0
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.700
They are trying to.

6681b788-c4cc-4c4a-9604-b443f5cb6f78-0
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.710
I think they're fighting and one
of them is falling from that.

8cf9175e-fb32-436b-aab4-8b93d345e9e2-0
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.020
OK, next.

2741f061-a08f-40bc-8a08-755f39e45044-0
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.670
{What is this thing called, as
I'm not

c842bbea-771d-432f-816e-66900c240b3d-0
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.770
Recall. I'm not able to recall
it. What is this thing?

893a62d4-591f-4408-8a6a-73df807d7dba-0
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:35.267
That's OK, just whatever you
could think of. But} so the she,

893a62d4-591f-4408-8a6a-73df807d7dba-1
00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:40.300
the girl on the spacecraft,
landed on this giant

7094169b-22b0-450c-9056-cf27d96d1a1a-0
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:49.886
On this giant vehicle which is
in a like which is flying in the

7094169b-22b0-450c-9056-cf27d96d1a1a-1
00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:50.360
sky.

10d8114d-b210-4a6e-91b8-cef8bac8cf80-0
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.170
Next.

8f9659a6-d549-439a-a3cc-e6d8a23a9e7d-0
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.908
It looks like she entered, you
know, entered into a different

8f9659a6-d549-439a-a3cc-e6d8a23a9e7d-1
00:11:04.908 --> 00:11:05.100
uh.

ed2d1712-bdf7-4ff9-b5c6-d1cbc80c7e7b-0
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.580
Building.

85d61f29-2e53-4707-9d29-e0b9e5bf15fa-0
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:16.143
Where and she's trying to sneak
into that area to catch that

85d61f29-2e53-4707-9d29-e0b9e5bf15fa-1
00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:17.850
bird, which is in the.

99343e23-57d0-4fef-9833-5516c29b04df-0
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.590
Uh, which is

df2db9b4-02af-4abe-ae73-ef2d405d0182-0
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.890
Which is inside those bars.

a2d6691e-20a4-4136-96d7-66709b8e8ffd-0
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:34.147
And but she's sneaking into that
area very quietly because she

a2d6691e-20a4-4136-96d7-66709b8e8ffd-1
00:11:34.147 --> 00:11:38.450
has to take care about, take
care of those two.

ae7abc79-99fd-435c-8a95-e367497ba7f9-0
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.150
Those two warriors. Or like they
are.

b26fbe4f-933e-4c03-8d52-d1fb07b59fd6-0
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.807
Those two persons who are like
security guards and they don't

b26fbe4f-933e-4c03-8d52-d1fb07b59fd6-1
00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:54.053
want to lose that bird. It seems
like the bird is very much

b26fbe4f-933e-4c03-8d52-d1fb07b59fd6-2
00:11:54.053 --> 00:11:54.689
precious.

1ac7741c-b995-4d32-bcf7-7e35345412e7-0
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.390
Next.

e88dd138-3d00-4baf-9d95-125fa145830b-0
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.720
OK, now the girl took away the
bird along with his cage.

429af64f-63cc-4410-a6cb-1f864e8c727a-0
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.190
Cage and the the protectors of
that bird.

2d209457-e361-4c63-8e3f-cb106fd70414-0
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.360
Are after that girl with their.

59e89c78-60b9-48b3-89ec-c344f4de359c-0
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.510
Swabs in the hand.

89e15dc0-10a9-48f0-9c6f-1956e51e7519-0
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.330
But somehow.

2c8c9be6-019b-4c17-a1fa-56787b9c604c-0
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.790
She managed.

fda66d46-fa39-4f79-9ea9-4691e4f6a749-0
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.760
To.

746ef07f-75f1-47e6-83e4-88cb0742c423-0
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.260
Uh, to make the bird free and
let him flew in the sky.

019a5602-ac9f-4708-bb50-1a5b2ce99e21-0
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.180
Next.

0633e79d-66cc-47a5-93ba-f0ddaf9825ba-0
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:45.160
The bird already flew from the
cage, but they caught the girl

0633e79d-66cc-47a5-93ba-f0ddaf9825ba-1
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.570
and.

6ccd4528-85e2-4e5e-ac30-6bc89bfee99b-0
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.360
I think they're going to punish
her.

67ff9d33-6e61-4ce6-bf5a-39796ab0d31a-0
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.300
Sooner or later.

10c11e16-16a7-48d3-9a17-5fc175ca3c99-0
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.620
So while she was.

b6435a83-e1f4-43c2-be1e-2c5b51a99c07-0
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.340
She was held in the in the cage.

8dd22ece-0b23-461f-b9f7-5f8f1f1c23cf-0
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.965
The girl. While the girl was
held in the cage, the bird came

8dd22ece-0b23-461f-b9f7-5f8f1f1c23cf-1
00:13:12.965 --> 00:13:13.280
back.

bf1ecfee-2073-44fc-9946-88443f5d0d0d-0
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.720
To and try to protect her.

3012d7d8-3852-46ed-9f48-67ecdba85e04-0
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.666
Then she started drawing a
painting on the floor and the

3012d7d8-3852-46ed-9f48-67ecdba85e04-1
00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.590
bird is sitting on her shoulder.

eb77ce99-8a5b-4a17-9412-89d5a6499e3d-0
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.670
Looking at her and how she used
the painting.

4345cbdb-2ae5-4475-adc5-109b4885e033-0
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.200
Next.

8de02925-36a8-4d97-836b-18353465ec5a-0
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.980
OK, so that wasn't a painting
exactly. She has some magical

8de02925-36a8-4d97-836b-18353465ec5a-1
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.293
thing in her hands which could
draw, you know, a mat which has

8de02925-36a8-4d97-836b-18353465ec5a-2
00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:48.980
some magical powers.

da5965e0-72a2-4d0f-879e-4c7e6a3ba94e-0
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.940
While so when she sits on that
magical mat, she has that power

da5965e0-72a2-4d0f-879e-4c7e6a3ba94e-1
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.620
of flying in the sky.

861895e6-53d4-4ba8-b106-460bf1a51dab-0
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.470
To any place.

d71d511f-01bf-4ea2-8c56-cb30ae0a0a97-0
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.160
Next.

df3f4a35-108c-4d7b-98c5-8bb8824b8ad8-0
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:08.653
Yeah, so look, she is now flying
in the sky and the bird is also

df3f4a35-108c-4d7b-98c5-8bb8824b8ad8-1
00:14:08.653 --> 00:14:12.460
let free and they are enjoying
this beautiful.

65aa15f0-09b7-431a-a97d-cd76fc5023c7-0
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.270
Gift of nature, looking at the
sky and the stars.

c4b9143e-ea6b-46e1-aa8c-705109f07ae3-0
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.660
And the trees mountains below.

41a21d4e-9dd9-41b0-abb9-042413858b5b-0
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.790
OK, now she built a home like a
small room.

21f914e8-7b34-4848-9c01-fc278dc686eb-0
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.760
Or a Burrow inside the tree bark
of the tree where she and her

21f914e8-7b34-4848-9c01-fc278dc686eb-1
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.990
bird friend can go inside and
stay in peace.

ecad019e-e1f9-41a4-aca2-6f70a86fbcae-0
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.210
So she lets her in that secret
room.

69d75c84-e43a-4b20-a661-400dbe338b29-0
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.090
In the bark of tree and both go
inside and enjoy their time.

a41f4e24-5e9a-4bcd-96cd-ca7661910e6a-0
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.220
OK, now she brought her bird.

4f31709f-ab5f-4462-a5f5-d8fc0386e1e7-0
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.590
To the to her guy friend.

b5e8811f-e54a-4171-8626-93586e20fa3d-0
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.840
Who was waiting right there at
the traffic lights.

4159a190-b6c3-448f-ae97-85cf7f45e749-0
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.790

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.580
{OK, so this story is 2 slides.}

{Umm.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.910
Is this?

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.480
Oh wait, can you?

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.790
Can you see my screen?}

{Yes, I can see your screen. OK.
So describe what you see

6e34200a-c80f-4f60-892b-709e9d9484ca-1
00:25:03.157 --> 00:25:07.952
happening in this story. And so
there's two slides of the story,

6e34200a-c80f-4f60-892b-709e9d9484ca-2
00:25:07.952 --> 00:25:12.230
so let me know when you like me
to go to the next slide.}

638bc804-bf20-434b-a18b-932e8369ca8b-0
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.930
{OK.}

6d566c7a-e100-4a21-af71-b12906006dcc-0
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.400
#START_arrival-3 So in this I
see.

3dc5b337-2fc2-405e-9da1-885ac2405d31-0
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.720
A man who is selling some
posters.

6dee34b5-28c0-495f-97d0-3e7491eed690-0
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.270
In the market, among the people.

e8028c0d-1125-414e-b511-8926f0aeca20-0
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:48.824
I see a Barber who is grooming a
person, like shaving or doing a

e8028c0d-1125-414e-b511-8926f0aeca20-1
00:25:48.824 --> 00:25:50.890
facial thing on him.

b2df35f7-ed5d-40b0-a8d9-54d8859fb071-0
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.235
Then I see a man who's holding a
trumpet along with his partner

b2df35f7-ed5d-40b0-a8d9-54d8859fb071-1
00:25:57.235 --> 00:26:02.230
holding a violin, and they're
trying to compose a really good

b2df35f7-ed5d-40b0-a8d9-54d8859fb071-2
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.130
music out of these two
instruments.

6ccf5623-b8d5-4d6b-97f2-10fff0ed7d3c-0
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.100
Then I see.

43abddcb-e13c-49e8-af12-04c19aab0b95-0
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.230
I don't understand what is it?

8ba3d586-baf2-4fdc-a036-c4c01faf9ce8-0
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.110
So then I see like group of
ladies sitting outside.

5cb40352-2c15-41a3-a891-b6da408be466-0
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.300
Chitchatting.

aedeac5f-6c78-4269-89a5-18dfd0963c7c-0
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.608
About their house or what. And I
see a confused personality in

aedeac5f-6c78-4269-89a5-18dfd0963c7c-1
00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:36.482
the last picture, holding a
briefcase and thinking where to

aedeac5f-6c78-4269-89a5-18dfd0963c7c-2
00:26:36.482 --> 00:26:40.870
go, as if he is lost and he's
trying to find out his.

7e46266a-d7c2-4baf-a2e9-960981ace6a2-0
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.950
Destination where he wants to
go.

8c6a8489-2773-44d0-8806-feff71aa8543-0
00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.390
I think that's it

4bde50cb-ac69-474b-8080-155625c00fa4-0
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:09.050


2741b45e-01f9-460f-9014-69aaa2eb18e6-0
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.120
So in this picture, that guy.

1557d04a-2ef6-4eb1-abf4-2e77af6b8511-0
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.860
It's a guy who finds a clock.

16f5eef3-9915-4ea6-ae6d-1d5bae2d90e8-0
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.780
And tries to figure out that.

5c0133cd-4f80-4c73-976e-7263102355de-0
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.930
Does this clock belong to

e24fd5d1-79a7-4a5e-a852-59bb81dd72f9-0
00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.120
Then he suddenly found the
diary.

0529d4b3-b157-4cc6-8ef5-57330285bbb7-0
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.480
From where he reads.

0f8ea84a-b4cd-4d6c-aa10-0c8fd449b9fb-0
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.250
About this clock and a person
comes.

71719bd7-2a77-40c2-ab88-b5e06da2a9a2-0
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.301
Another different person comes
and chit chats with him about

71719bd7-2a77-40c2-ab88-b5e06da2a9a2-1
00:27:46.301 --> 00:27:50.290
it, like where you wanna go, and
then he asks him.

2b807a54-f566-4435-b66e-3a1cdba23cab-0
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.280
This is a very complex picture.

4bbf0a01-576a-4393-8373-27d9aa129bbd-0
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:55.540
Oh.

1e2bc776-4896-4b4f-b988-c0b4891ae036-0
00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.190
And then he's trying to show him
that there is this.

fe1d8e3d-acd1-4c01-bcca-c05e1bfebfe0-0
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.098
Thing which I'm trying to find
out and that strange guy is

fe1d8e3d-acd1-4c01-bcca-c05e1bfebfe0-1
00:28:06.098 --> 00:28:06.900
helping him.

80e62137-d69f-45f7-b792-54f894992e0f-0
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.230
To find that.

09c86006-068f-4750-99bd-911163773f5d-0
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:11.870
Thing.

e05414e7-5e86-4020-81b7-3e18469f8112-0
00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.210
#END_arrival-3 This is really a
bad picture.

1b75a03b-f1d5-4108-9380-5d9ea1927807-0
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.730
{Then right.

7dc1cc6c-6b65-456e-809f-8a4f0bdea51d-0
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.870
From where do you guys get these
pictures?

a3873d95-f741-4b94-82d1-03f3f1ccc6bf-0
00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.896
Um, we just selected we like,
went through a lot of books and

a3873d95-f741-4b94-82d1-03f3f1ccc6bf-1
00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:43.780
selected the pictures.}

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.930
{OK, NEXT is another complex
scene. Oh.}

1d6f9397-ee6a-406e-a2f9-aa87ec765e9d-0

{OK.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.704
I'm going to share my screen
now, so this one's a scene, so

03aac800-285a-4a61-b821-afe012381b9e-1
00:29:22.704 --> 00:29:24.450

the scene.}

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.890
#START_waldo-1 This is a scene
of a market.

e0788c88-c6be-4f6b-8b8f-a4ae85244cbd-0
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:04.850
Plus the.

e25b43aa-92fb-4cf7-928a-bb42efec503b-0
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.047
Yeah, this is a scene of a
market where you can see the

e25b43aa-92fb-4cf7-928a-bb42efec503b-1
00:30:12.047 --> 00:30:16.385
fountain in the centre of the
city and can also see the

e25b43aa-92fb-4cf7-928a-bb42efec503b-2
00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:17.160
different.

2adac9f7-12fe-4de3-8189-c425e97c9d38-0
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.710
Colors.

84ecb9aa-8192-409d-acfe-285d27d2f906-0
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.870
Of the cars moving around.

20d74f32-a4ea-4f60-ad4b-8bbee3fdc589-0
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.440
Then we also see over here.

f96f7daa-f9b8-44cf-bd3e-8b99d4b6fbf9-0
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.790

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.953
It's still, it looks like there
is a carnival going on this in

63a115f1-ac75-4673-b6e9-919ee8645645-1
00:30:37.953 --> 00:30:38.780
this arena.

5675a343-1822-4637-9a01-2e053fccd0f5-0
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.280
And people are having uh.

f6a80fee-310b-4723-bc9c-88c90cc6fcf9-0
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.855
Stalls for selling their pots
and the plants at one of the

f6a80fee-310b-4723-bc9c-88c90cc6fcf9-1
00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:49.050
shop which I saw in the right
side.

0e34ba48-0afa-4924-9276-52e0493b546e-0
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:56.890
And everyone is stopping by and
visiting those stalls to.

55089e63-f173-4bb7-a300-d3f3e603c413-0
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.180
Get something good and fancy for
their houses.

0c5ac337-72f3-4a7e-9193-c2bceac4281e-0
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.080
Then I see a bunch of people.

22876730-9dc0-4466-ba1d-9530b7418142-0
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.080
Standing on the rooftop.

b590aced-32ec-4711-bda2-72a79bced030-0
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.700
Of left hand side building.

45b6bbee-de0e-456d-a900-e577705102ce-0
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:17.017
They are dressed up in a same
attire, blue and white, and

45b6bbee-de0e-456d-a900-e577705102ce-1
00:31:17.017 --> 00:31:20.170
looks like they are the
cleaners.

2065e9f4-ab99-43af-b162-4aeb12487e54-0
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.720
And belong. Yeah, they look like
the from the cleaning team.

8b7718f7-920b-4ca2-a521-99a707bb8403-0
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.370
Then on the other hand, I see
like.

b5ac6128-f48f-4e65-99b0-058f76e2383a-0
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.143
I see the kids who are who have
come out for a walk with their

b5ac6128-f48f-4e65-99b0-058f76e2383a-1
00:31:45.143 --> 00:31:45.740
parents.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.440
Yeah, then I also see a person
who is fixing his car.

de6ac674-2617-4167-8096-bf41fffdf377-0
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.840
In that house.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.200
Yep, the green car.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.000
It looks like a lot of hustle in
the market.

0f3d5d7a-2677-4821-8557-1fc91102276f-0
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.020

windows of their rooms.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.820
Then moving to right hand side I
see a woman.

05475fe6-7d5b-4b30-910a-09a439be1874-0
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.570

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:01.270
A boy. A boy, yeah. He enters

grown up.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.830
The husband and wife are talking
on some topic.

c26f8ebd-1cce-46a8-95cf-2842fb73a091-0
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.822

c26f8ebd-1cce-46a8-95cf-2842fb73a091-1
00:36:36.822 --> 00:36:41.864

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.650
Small animal who looks like a
squirrel to me.

1496f4ac-7231-45ae-aaca-bf99b5b0a9b9-0
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:20.154
And trying to play with him.
Then the then her husband takes

00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:25.517

he's someone else. He's the

1496f4ac-7231-45ae-aaca-bf99b5b0a9b9-2
00:37:25.517 --> 00:37:30.607

took the pot out from the

00:37:30.607 --> 00:37:35.969
cupboard and they both are
holding apart, which is I think

1496f4ac-7231-45ae-aaca-bf99b5b0a9b9-4
00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:41.060
made-up of soil or some paint is
done on it. That's it.

22f930c2-9a8b-43e4-a8e9-d1169c99e2d4-0
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.980
So I see the image of the pot in
the mirror.

d12505d7-ce24-4f56-8d6c-d6010982c91f-0
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.100
It's placed on a table.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.160
And the boy wakes up.

f41eaade-f959-41a2-8b75-f46c8843d5f1-0
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.620
And he needs his.

825edfbc-2a58-46fa-8aa8-312d42ca14ee-0
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.090
Pets at Home.

c275f6d6-9993-4711-8feb-3d0a8560ec8f-0
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:14.093
He's getting dressed up and then
putting shirt on him and putting

c275f6d6-9993-4711-8feb-3d0a8560ec8f-1
00:38:14.093 --> 00:38:14.360

Buttoning up the shirt.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.470
His pet take off his hat and
then run away.

a8ec4ae0-62c2-484d-9d62-2f79db8c13d4-0
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.510
I see a bunch of people.

8909770f-5d8a-4e33-af2e-b46d2518cd82-0
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.000
On the road they are busy in.

05968426-bdc7-46ca-9ebb-5581f6e29521-0
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.830
Busy in walking towards their
work.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:06.268
Then in the next picture I see a
man talking to a person asking

2cb1251f-a8cb-4001-80ef-f1554a2ced64-1
00:39:06.268 --> 00:39:07.380

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.890
In regard to the food for his
pet.

3b3e130f-4ee4-4e9d-90fc-d7b36d6674ce-0
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.070
Then the person shopkeeper says
that he doesn't have that

3b3e130f-4ee4-4e9d-90fc-d7b36d6674ce-1
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.400

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.081
Lastly, I see like people are
chatting with each other and

a23c78ee-37b0-4673-b735-cab6d7cf5040-1
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.480
cleaning the roads.

more.
