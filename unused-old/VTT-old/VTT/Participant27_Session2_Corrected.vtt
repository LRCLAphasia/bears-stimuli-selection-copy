00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.230
So continuing with our study,
this next one is a graphic

688fc696-f4b8-4de1-ad05-2564cb2c5ce7-1
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.380
novel. Like we said last
session, please describe what

688fc696-f4b8-4de1-ad05-2564cb2c5ce7-2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.832
you see and what is happening
and tell the story as you go

688fc696-f4b8-4de1-ad05-2564cb2c5ce7-3
00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:19.680
through the pages. So this one
has around 8 pages.

008a2be2-7cf8-402b-8887-bc29218462eb-0
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.960
OK, I think I'll use my other
glove again. I'm sorry, it's.

85ab80eb-afd2-4552-a567-fce43e9dae55-0
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.252
Huge on the screen.
#START_arrival_4 Alright, so man

85ab80eb-afd2-4552-a567-fce43e9dae55-1
00:00:38.252 --> 00:00:41.953
is taking a shower, he's
shaving, he's getting dressed,

85ab80eb-afd2-4552-a567-fce43e9dae55-2
00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:45.059
so it's probably getting ready
in the morning.

cafcb07b-9943-4f2b-92d4-44c69feb0427-0
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.266
He takes his hats. He looks at
the map. He's trying to figure

cafcb07b-9943-4f2b-92d4-44c69feb0427-1
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.270
out where to go.

1dbcf02b-c738-46f1-b79a-d7d0c6e7a045-0
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.670
And he's got a a little
companion. A little.

bcadd12a-b32e-4751-8ea8-bfc7a575f94f-0
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.190
Creature that's a odd looking
creature.

3030f64c-7711-4dad-9e95-13fc6927a04c-0
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.365
But it's following him, and he's
going through a large city with

3030f64c-7711-4dad-9e95-13fc6927a04c-1
00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:12.690
complicated roads and buildings,
and he's in fact.

7808f8af-c82d-449f-b7a3-269e5e82f991-0
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.910
Looking at this map again,
trying to decide what to go. The

7808f8af-c82d-449f-b7a3-269e5e82f991-1
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.990
creature is is attending him,
and there he is.

40b75a90-9aeb-47fe-bb52-4ec0f9a31978-0
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.573
In the midst of a whole bunch of
other people, there are teepee

40b75a90-9aeb-47fe-bb52-4ec0f9a31978-1
00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:32.532
like buildings and there are
ships floating through the air.

40b75a90-9aeb-47fe-bb52-4ec0f9a31978-2
00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:37.166
There's a huge viaduct or
aqueduct, which maybe the like

40b75a90-9aeb-47fe-bb52-4ec0f9a31978-3
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:42.370
the boats on top of it. And it's
a it's a very busy scene. Lots

40b75a90-9aeb-47fe-bb52-4ec0f9a31978-4
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.410
of things are moving about and
happening, and he's consulting

40b75a90-9aeb-47fe-bb52-4ec0f9a31978-5
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.720
his map accompanied by his
little mysterious friend.

d6065181-b352-41fc-bdcc-2b742c9aab06-0
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.695
The the little creature that's
accompanying him is now joined

d6065181-b352-41fc-bdcc-2b742c9aab06-1
00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:06.789
by a bird like creature with two
very tall pointy things on its

d6065181-b352-41fc-bdcc-2b742c9aab06-2
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.042
head, and they stand between the
man and the woman who is reading

d6065181-b352-41fc-bdcc-2b742c9aab06-3
00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:17.057
a book. The man asked the woman
a question. It seems like he's

d6065181-b352-41fc-bdcc-2b742c9aab06-4
00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:22.072
trying to ask how to get to a
certain place on his map and the

d6065181-b352-41fc-bdcc-2b742c9aab06-5
00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:22.550
woman.

75105153-5986-4df2-b188-3b47f6a1d874-0
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.748
Shows him this machine. It looks
like a a phone machine except

75105153-5986-4df2-b188-3b47f6a1d874-1
00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:35.730
it's got a big handle on the
left hand side and she pulls the

75105153-5986-4df2-b188-3b47f6a1d874-2
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.660
handle and out pops.

13c95e69-34a5-4bf3-a5b8-4b0e5e503a9b-0
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.281
Something. It's it's a card of
some kind which he gives to the

13c95e69-34a5-4bf3-a5b8-4b0e5e503a9b-1
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:45.630
man.

9b6b4457-bce4-40b5-a0bf-14d75ccaba41-0
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.319
And they then the scene shifts
and we're looking up at the sky

9b6b4457-bce4-40b5-a0bf-14d75ccaba41-1
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.388
with all these boats floating
through the through the sky

9b6b4457-bce4-40b5-a0bf-14d75ccaba41-2
00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:56.160
above them.

96283345-f54c-499c-806d-5c0ba117b614-0
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.740
And it looks like one comes in
to land and they get on it and

96283345-f54c-499c-806d-5c0ba117b614-1
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.660
it seems that the the card is a
ticket because a ticket taker

96283345-f54c-499c-806d-5c0ba117b614-2
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.469
punches it and lets him onto the
onto the boat.

deff732a-e933-43a5-89f1-4e5076ace783-0
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.660
And then

6c6967de-b251-49d7-9dd4-902e94d80b34-0
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.430
Then we're going to move on, OK.

fc4154d0-1bcc-49a5-bf81-b7b0bf6d5cc6-0
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.097
So they're they're on the boat
now, man still accompanied by

fc4154d0-1bcc-49a5-bf81-b7b0bf6d5cc6-1
00:03:26.097 --> 00:03:30.422
his little mouse like creature
friend, and woman still has her

fc4154d0-1bcc-49a5-bf81-b7b0bf6d5cc6-2
00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:34.404
little bird like friend, and
they're sitting next to each

fc4154d0-1bcc-49a5-bf81-b7b0bf6d5cc6-3
00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:35.640
other on the boat.

2593c736-618c-4481-a6a4-2c57a4629fbf-0
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.140
And they're having a a
conversation, and the man pulled

2593c736-618c-4481-a6a4-2c57a4629fbf-1
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.223
out of his pocket a picture with
a piece of paper, with a picture

2593c736-618c-4481-a6a4-2c57a4629fbf-2
00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:51.910
on it, and some writing. And the
woman.

ae35daaf-b25e-464d-ba3e-06e8261ea1aa-0
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.150
Also expresses surprise and
pulls out of her bag.

2bb98701-89f8-4d0b-99e4-5964d2d3b6eb-0
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.581
A very similar looking picture.
The picture of of the the man

2bb98701-89f8-4d0b-99e4-5964d2d3b6eb-1
00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:10.526
has is looks like a picture of a
a man or a boy, and the picture

2bb98701-89f8-4d0b-99e4-5964d2d3b6eb-2
00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:14.460
that the woman has is a picture
of a girl.

408c5024-1ae0-4ab1-a5c0-fc3b082247ab-0
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.146
And that now the scene shifts to
the girl that's pictured in the

408c5024-1ae0-4ab1-a5c0-fc3b082247ab-1
00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:26.174
on the woman's paper reading a
book. But somebody comes along,

408c5024-1ae0-4ab1-a5c0-fc3b082247ab-2
00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:31.281
looks like a a man's hand, takes
the book away and puts it away

408c5024-1ae0-4ab1-a5c0-fc3b082247ab-3
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:35.830
and locks it up in a drawer. He
gives the girl a shovel.

e4baa035-01bf-42c3-b72c-59850be05025-0
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.490
Tells her to. Looks like to
stoke a furnace.

a1cee42c-3a83-45a8-a9e9-efae9c46dcdb-0
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.640
And the.

68c8fc17-4b0c-45ed-b0f6-513c23409880-0
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.149
But the furnace starts smoking
and the the girl decides there's

68c8fc17-4b0c-45ed-b0f6-513c23409880-1
00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:56.085
something wrong with the
chimney. So she climbs up the

68c8fc17-4b0c-45ed-b0f6-513c23409880-2
00:04:56.085 --> 00:05:00.307
ladder with a big brush and is
attempting to clean out the

68c8fc17-4b0c-45ed-b0f6-513c23409880-3
00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:00.879
chimney.

5fe4d5e0-5baa-4222-a38f-9b90de31f797-0
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.690
OK.

2ed74211-2aba-4529-8a68-4fff6740c38b-0
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.470
And.

b71ed1b8-841b-4967-8fea-8eef0bf9aa73-0
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.103
It seems that there are a huge
number of similar rooms inside

b71ed1b8-841b-4967-8fea-8eef0bf9aa73-1
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:16.448
of a big building, although we
can see the sky, so it's it's

b71ed1b8-841b-4967-8fea-8eef0bf9aa73-2
00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:21.356
not entirely enclosed, but the
the the girl is is is is

b71ed1b8-841b-4967-8fea-8eef0bf9aa73-3
00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:27.052
standing on top trying to clean
out this chimney and there are a

b71ed1b8-841b-4967-8fea-8eef0bf9aa73-4
00:05:27.052 --> 00:05:31.959
whole bunch of similar rooms
with similar chimneys with

b71ed1b8-841b-4967-8fea-8eef0bf9aa73-5
00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.639
similar looking girls in them
stoking the

85d570e7-3cb0-46b6-a170-88699758f9bc-0
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.310
Furnace. The girl

0dfdb590-6198-454a-a71b-451e8be3e378-0
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.760
Comes down from this. She
appears very sad. She's trapped,

0dfdb590-6198-454a-a71b-451e8be3e378-1
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.926
but she gets the idea of using
the shovel to force open the

0dfdb590-6198-454a-a71b-451e8be3e378-2
00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:55.264
door to the chamber in which
she's trapped, and she succeeds.

0dfdb590-6198-454a-a71b-451e8be3e378-3
00:05:55.264 --> 00:06:00.344
She gets back to the drawer
where the book has been placed

0dfdb590-6198-454a-a71b-451e8be3e378-4
00:06:00.344 --> 00:06:05.683
and takes the book and leaves.
She gets to a, a, looks like a

0dfdb590-6198-454a-a71b-451e8be3e378-5
00:06:05.683 --> 00:06:09.730
train yard when she climbs onto
a train wagon.

9cecd532-47a1-4388-9c13-d920b426f30b-0
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.720
Uh and the train wagon.

2f55bc56-45dc-4615-b8fa-e89b3346a377-0
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.925
The, the, the, the wagon that
she's in departs as part of a a

2f55bc56-45dc-4615-b8fa-e89b3346a377-1
00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:21.730
train and she's away from
wherever it was she was.

5c89ddbe-febd-4ecb-a00c-002476f77245-0
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.144
So now they the boat with the
with the man and the woman has

5c89ddbe-febd-4ecb-a00c-002476f77245-1
00:06:32.144 --> 00:06:34.790
reached probably a a new.

c07b0362-3dc9-4e66-a0dd-d855f7f7889e-0
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.923
a new place. The the woman
points out to the man something,

c07b0362-3dc9-4e66-a0dd-d855f7f7889e-1
00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:45.985
it's not clear what she's
pointing at. Maybe one of the

c07b0362-3dc9-4e66-a0dd-d855f7f7889e-2
00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:51.771
the billboards that you see in
the in the first picture on that

c07b0362-3dc9-4e66-a0dd-d855f7f7889e-3
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:57.375
page. The the man, the the the
conductor of the boat makes an

c07b0362-3dc9-4e66-a0dd-d855f7f7889e-4
00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:03.070
announcement using a megaphone.
The boat comes into a dock and

c07b0362-3dc9-4e66-a0dd-d855f7f7889e-5
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.150
the woman bids the man.

e51d358f-72c2-4e58-9919-a5367e167516-0
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.703
goodbye, so they part, and she
gives they shake hands and the

e51d358f-72c2-4e58-9919-a5367e167516-1
00:07:10.703 --> 00:07:15.569
man goes off with his little
mouse like companion and is

e51d358f-72c2-4e58-9919-a5367e167516-2
00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.435
wondering what to do next. And
he sees a big statue with

e51d358f-72c2-4e58-9919-a5367e167516-3
00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:25.728
something that looks like his
his little friend that has been

e51d358f-72c2-4e58-9919-a5367e167516-4
00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:27.179
accompanying him.

0da3afed-8869-4777-b20a-e6ee18542bf4-0
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:37.225
And uh, the the so, so the the
statue dominates a landscape of

0da3afed-8869-4777-b20a-e6ee18542bf4-1
00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:39.160
buildings and.

9010f42e-af34-4db7-a10f-f7339122500b-0
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.810
So I think he's wondering.

f43370c6-498f-429d-bc7b-b8c70348a1b4-0
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.300
He's wondering.

34c8b29a-1338-42a2-ae38-0cc0636ff45b-0
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.500
What this large statue is all
about.

a9c62eb3-62d6-4475-b2af-0e5e0bb35702-0
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.530
So next.

9e59ad2d-5844-43b9-9f89-a6ef7bbbbafe-0
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:07.296
So he he travels on. He walks
through a a street with lots of

9e59ad2d-5844-43b9-9f89-a6ef7bbbbafe-1
00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:08.450
people.

d85f1a40-92ed-46a4-bd86-4217b244198a-0
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:16.393
There, there are people selling
things. Looks like big octopuses

d85f1a40-92ed-46a4-bd86-4217b244198a-1
00:08:16.393 --> 00:08:21.110
or squids in a in a cart,
there's a a woman.

3e3fd240-b460-42cc-9970-b5ffe0d09ff8-0
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.080
Taking something out of a of a.

d38209df-ffa6-4b49-a5f4-ba61f57f1c57-0
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.740
Looks like a vending machine.

1ebb562e-8589-4c13-8c98-5e280f79596c-0
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.220
A man looking at a.

d7eb6fa0-657a-4f40-bdaa-2e75440501b3-0
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.479
Creature that maybe he wants to
buy, but the. Anyway, all this

d7eb6fa0-657a-4f40-bdaa-2e75440501b3-1
00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.850
activity is going on the man.

9f1db1d0-6b2b-4dcd-8c21-737a37cc6070-0
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.360


b2562d81-cb76-4d7a-9ea7-0297ff6a9c94-0
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:50.077
Looks at his, looks at the book
and sees a picture of a loaf of

b2562d81-cb76-4d7a-9ea7-0297ff6a9c94-1
00:08:50.077 --> 00:08:54.370
bread and his companion is
pointing at.

1cb3766b-18b6-4f17-bbb7-1292eac93672-0
00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.081
A little door in one of these
vending machines or and the man

1cb3766b-18b6-4f17-bbb7-1292eac93672-1
00:09:02.081 --> 00:09:06.950
opens the door or drawer, in
fact, and finds.

7c6aea3b-7f4f-4db3-9719-478e2ff4192c-0
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.416
Something in it. Not quite sure
what that is, but he's looking

7c6aea3b-7f4f-4db3-9719-478e2ff4192c-1
00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:14.240
at his book.

1a42aa95-a079-4f5e-ba0e-ba594e9d1ff4-0
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.670
And then he takes this.

52e74c6e-e177-4011-abd0-5e1997a590c4-0
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:23.478
Thing it's a, looks some some
kind of creature with a a long

52e74c6e-e177-4011-abd0-5e1997a590c4-1
00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:24.640
tail I think.

96f555b8-c668-4b69-9cfa-e740173e7fbb-0
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.440
And.

cc667020-99ab-48da-bdd0-bc105bd270f6-0
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.410
He.

2d8d2950-e778-4005-b301-be699a92c907-0
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.488
Oh, no, it's not the man who's
taken this thing. It's a it's a

2d8d2950-e778-4005-b301-be699a92c907-1
00:09:35.488 --> 00:09:40.616
boy who has taken the, the, the,
this creature from the drawer

2d8d2950-e778-4005-b301-be699a92c907-2
00:09:40.616 --> 00:09:45.826
that the man opened, and the boy
with another man, who probably

2d8d2950-e778-4005-b301-be699a92c907-3
00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:47.210
the boy's father.

d1b508e6-f835-433d-b6e2-07f40fe45fd3-0
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.267
Looks happy. And they offer this
thing from the drawer to the

d1b508e6-f835-433d-b6e2-07f40fe45fd3-1
00:09:55.267 --> 00:10:01.276
original man and he says, no,
that's not what I want. I want

d1b508e6-f835-433d-b6e2-07f40fe45fd3-2
00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:07.580
this loaf of bread and the boy's
father says, Oh, well you need

d1b508e6-f835-433d-b6e2-07f40fe45fd3-3
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.210
to look in this other drawer.
And he pulls out

25df8aab-26d6-4151-814e-ae26f812ef31-0
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.588
Something else which still
doesn't look like a loaf of

25df8aab-26d6-4151-814e-ae26f812ef31-1
00:10:17.588 --> 00:10:22.913
bread, and the man tries to eat
it, but maybe doesn't succeed,

25df8aab-26d6-4151-814e-ae26f812ef31-2
00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:27.900
and the boy gives to him a
basket, and the boy's father is

25df8aab-26d6-4151-814e-ae26f812ef31-3
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.760
explaining to the man.

f2680b85-c08f-4e84-b8ba-dade9d450474-0
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.500
Perhaps what to do with that
basket.

c2a05ed0-5c4b-4ae0-9fcc-e5771dfd7ae5-0
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.370
So we advance. We maybe find
out.

5c790f85-29a4-4d70-b9d6-43d544d7fa8f-0
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.320
And.

9beac8d7-c240-428a-a578-84f0d5f60d73-0
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.920
The man, the boy's father.

6fa6c044-be82-4a73-aa7a-520afdd3cd06-0
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:46.770
has

b72fb220-f100-49a8-9dfa-cc186c2dba07-0
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.230
A another.

a795775b-8b03-4584-9750-857f8bd84bcb-0
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.050
Creature.

068a001e-5879-4a3d-a9eb-96f4b514c8eb-0
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.850
And the boy has.

a0eb6cd6-5dee-42d4-b438-a32eff23b452-0
00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:01.270
Yet another looks like a a horn
of some kind with.

24f7899f-df1c-4fa5-bd09-adcaad45c6fe-0
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.000
Little white things coming out
of it.

9d336758-3d40-47d0-ba25-f7494a816469-0
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.574
The the man says you can eat
that, but that is the, sorry,

9d336758-3d40-47d0-ba25-f7494a816469-1
00:11:11.574 --> 00:11:17.035
the boy's father says you can
eat that. The boy shows this big

9d336758-3d40-47d0-ba25-f7494a816469-2
00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:20.850
fruit like object, maybe like a
strawberry.

ac0709f6-87bd-4991-8248-d1d93c949d8c-0
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.780
And.

9e3c3427-fa1f-4865-b019-91bdb61f0a14-0
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:30.030
The probably the the boy's
father has this.

d33bf014-256a-41f9-a1e9-3c73b5611df7-0
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.720
Other thing with tentacles
coming out of it.

1f401054-02da-45ea-9523-bb0bc1e252a2-0
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.753
And and then produces some from
another place in the wall of of

1f401054-02da-45ea-9523-bb0bc1e252a2-1
00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:47.365
vending machine type wall, a
long, then snake like thing, and

1f401054-02da-45ea-9523-bb0bc1e252a2-2
00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:53.067
then he's got a shell like thing
or something and then a fruit

1f401054-02da-45ea-9523-bb0bc1e252a2-3
00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:58.861
like thing. There are all kinds
of things that can be eaten and

1f401054-02da-45ea-9523-bb0bc1e252a2-4
00:11:58.861 --> 00:12:04.654
the man, the original man, tries
one of these things, the fruit

1f401054-02da-45ea-9523-bb0bc1e252a2-5
00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:05.649
like thing.

4d3947df-b336-4886-953e-9c4cebd4a341-0
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.020
And the boy is feeding the
man's.

319116a0-10ab-4a07-b713-d97444bbcaa9-0
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.340
Mouse like companion.

7e5ea95c-2f98-47ad-8172-fdf6bba895f4-0
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:22.830
This the same fruit. So with all
of this the the the man.

969fba69-fcb9-42d2-8b2d-b37e45ce43ad-0
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.940
Have a variety of things he can
eat in this basket.

115fcf01-fb8c-419a-a35d-ee13828cab71-0
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.885
And then the boy says to his
father, he whispered something

115fcf01-fb8c-419a-a35d-ee13828cab71-1
00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:33.780
to his father.

653f63a2-2f5f-450c-aed2-22c30f777aa0-0
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.690
And the the boy's father.

6b2e7c1d-64dd-4407-9bc9-6dd6b621acc5-0
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.190
is friendly to the original man.

19e14116-1cac-4451-9c3a-639a380ab9b9-0

some kind and the the boy joins

19e14116-1cac-4451-9c3a-639a380ab9b9-1
00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:55.300

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:03.077
They all go down to a place
where there there are a bunch of

7302baa2-71e9-43a2-9fe2-c9a282ab61d7-1
00:13:03.077 --> 00:13:10.104
boats sitting on a on a dry
lakebed or something and you see

7302baa2-71e9-43a2-9fe2-c9a282ab61d7-2
00:13:10.104 --> 00:13:15.750
an elaborate but strange city in
the background.

c07e7a1b-0e8c-48a8-8d22-54c06fba2e64-0
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.880
So next. So now.

692b8fcb-d107-4cd6-a10d-58dbdb056f63-0
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:28.141
The the boy approaches one of
the boats with the mouse like

692b8fcb-d107-4cd6-a10d-58dbdb056f63-1
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.430

Tells the man to.

b7ddeb30-ae04-4981-899b-cf5d5f6c90f3-0
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.340
Come on and and he he shows
this.

14a26be6-f36c-4751-adf0-f95673603016-0
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.663
urn, a large vessel that's
sitting on on the boat. The man

14a26be6-f36c-4751-adf0-f95673603016-1
00:13:45.663 --> 00:13:48.090
and and there's a tentacle.

23af16c9-0ab8-44d1-b2ce-89e313ae518f-0
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.703
Popping out, and then something
even the more of the tentacle

23af16c9-0ab8-44d1-b2ce-89e313ae518f-1
00:13:53.703 --> 00:13:58.513
pops out the the man expresses
surprise and actually drops all

23af16c9-0ab8-44d1-b2ce-89e313ae518f-2

the food that he's been carrying
in the basket, and the boy

23af16c9-0ab8-44d1-b2ce-89e313ae518f-3
00:14:03.094 --> 00:14:05.080
laughs at the man's alarm.

c3afe8fb-1e7a-4592-9435-cbd02babd516-0
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.300
 The boy, the boy's father
reassures the,

76b2b05c-54df-4970-bceb-9ccc561c6119-0
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.400
The man and says there's nothing
to be worried about, and the boy

76b2b05c-54df-4970-bceb-9ccc561c6119-1
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.676
shows the creature that has this
long tentacle and in fact it's

76b2b05c-54df-4970-bceb-9ccc561c6119-2

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.300
Oh it's a cat like thing.

43643167-2a43-43c2-8b4d-f1bb198ce1a5-0
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.478
And um, but it's very, very
friendly. It looks like it's the

43643167-2a43-43c2-8b4d-f1bb198ce1a5-1
00:14:31.478 --> 00:14:32.260

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.130
And they, the boy and his
father, look at this.

a76ab518-1645-410a-8ea5-c36ed6a07dbd-0
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.303
This Cat like thing making

a76ab518-1645-410a-8ea5-c36ed6a07dbd-1
00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:51.872

man has brought and they seem to

a76ab518-1645-410a-8ea5-c36ed6a07dbd-2

But.

fd48e930-15d5-4f69-9472-ed77c7410eb5-0
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:03.082
The the the man is still trying
to find something and he he

fd48e930-15d5-4f69-9472-ed77c7410eb5-1
00:15:03.082 --> 00:15:06.210
draws a picture in his book to
try and.

712cf15b-792d-4e16-84a4-6fb77b4219df-0
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.542
Explain to the boy's father what
he wants, but he's drawing

712cf15b-792d-4e16-84a4-6fb77b4219df-1
00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:15.010
pictures, presumably because
they don't have a common

712cf15b-792d-4e16-84a4-6fb77b4219df-2
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.230
language, but they.

525d19a2-3718-4c3f-9ea9-70db6f059aaf-0
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.230
The, the. The.

5808b769-5da7-444d-96ea-07babb07e435-0
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.415
The boy's father seems to know
something he he explains

5808b769-5da7-444d-96ea-07babb07e435-1
00:15:26.415 --> 00:15:32.604
something and and he's looking
up to the sky and a light is

5808b769-5da7-444d-96ea-07babb07e435-2
00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:38.896
getting brighter and and we we
zoom in on the guy's face and

5808b769-5da7-444d-96ea-07babb07e435-3
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:43.950
then his eye and what comes
next? #END_arrival_4

53837d56-27a0-4892-8e83-f6c00ce4eab5-0
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.280
Good for this part of the story,
so I know later.

a8eceb8f-770a-4941-b1c9-a0e1db7c7a1d-0
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.990
Yes, I wanted to know what
happened.

48784dcc-eda7-439a-abd2-96e08d553a82-0
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.413
It's very interesting, but for
now we're looking at this

48784dcc-eda7-439a-abd2-96e08d553a82-1
00:15:59.413 --> 00:16:03.590
complex scene, so unlike the
graphic novels, it's just going

48784dcc-eda7-439a-abd2-96e08d553a82-2
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.220
to be one page, and so please
describe it in detail.

0e837bd9-c2ce-4e61-b261-e0cf3c9b1221-0
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.700
Here we go.

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-0
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.271
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
page is called escape from the

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-1
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:18.931
zoo. {The Penguins were bored
with life at the zoo, so they

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-2
00:16:18.931 --> 00:16:22.346
hatched a plan to escape from
their enclosure. They are

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-3
00:16:22.346 --> 00:16:26.311
enjoying their newfound freedom,
completely unaware of the chaos

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-4
00:16:26.311 --> 00:16:29.970
they have created around them.
Spike love skateboarding and

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-5
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.691
mafia cannot believe that ice
cream cones taste so good. Can

0e98ab23-0040-40dc-9ae4-d659515b88df-6
00:16:33.691 --> 00:16:35.460
you pick out all 10 Penguins?

6209230b-98b6-4c78-8024-46f46f24ba73-0
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.971
And that's a a caption on the
page that I just read.} And

6209230b-98b6-4c78-8024-46f46f24ba73-1
00:16:41.971 --> 00:16:47.104
indeed, it is a scene from a
zoo. And there are all kinds of

6209230b-98b6-4c78-8024-46f46f24ba73-2
00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:52.154
animals there. Penguins don't
seem to be the only ones that

6209230b-98b6-4c78-8024-46f46f24ba73-3
00:16:52.154 --> 00:16:57.456
have escaped. In fact, there's a
rhinoceros that seems to have

6209230b-98b6-4c78-8024-46f46f24ba73-4
00:16:57.456 --> 00:17:02.169
escaped and is chasing people
who are running away in a

6209230b-98b6-4c78-8024-46f46f24ba73-5
00:17:02.169 --> 00:17:03.599
terrified manner.

7b0d2e36-7f36-4e4e-8051-4961d3da34d7-0
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.310
The there's this.

5254fe29-7f53-47ff-b3b9-e46a72dceda8-0
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.790
Some large giraffes who are.

3c392e03-32eb-4efd-a792-8954cec6820a-0
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.940
Reaching over the railing and
and eating.

287066d8-a3cc-4c68-8213-f37cd0c65428-0
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.350
Foods that are.

200d8c46-4ec7-44da-8e5c-26bed26c8644-0
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:28.264
People have brought from
themselves and are scaring the

200d8c46-4ec7-44da-8e5c-26bed26c8644-1
00:17:28.264 --> 00:17:33.590
people. There are there's a
parrot flying around.

a53a65d1-6562-4666-a2f5-a1e35a3a783c-0
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:40.706
Chasing an airplane that is
driven by one of the escaping

a53a65d1-6562-4666-a2f5-a1e35a3a783c-1
00:17:40.706 --> 00:17:44.670
Penguins, there are a bunch of
gorillas.

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-0
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.267
That people are looking at and
either the gorillas are

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-1
00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:54.290
imitating, one of one of the
gorillas that's imitating one of

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-2
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.377
the boys, or one of the boys is
imitating one of the gorillas.

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-3
00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:02.464
It's not really clear they're
both doing the same thing, but I

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-4
00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:06.550
I think it's the the the boy was
imitating the gorilla because

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-5
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.637
one of the guards of the zoo,
one of the keepers is is telling

e5c5411b-6799-42ed-bf8e-3e2ba1ad9228-6
00:18:10.637 --> 00:18:12.130
the boy not to do that.

14792495-a60d-47c8-bc13-9dbda4376b8e-0
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.840
And uh, there's, uh, there's a
shop and there's a cafe.

a1e946cf-d4ee-4554-8d24-e314a53bc9a2-0
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:26.606
People are patronizing. There's
an ice cream stand in the middle

a1e946cf-d4ee-4554-8d24-e314a53bc9a2-1
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:31.270
where which seems to be doing a
a good business.

47fcfff9-ce44-4e16-80f9-88fec0b9155d-0
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.900
We also see.

2dc2537d-6a32-41d4-ac0d-e0b0ac014c59-0
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.120
Trees with.

72876e00-1e50-4845-8123-794848013a29-0
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.190
Yes, they're they're lemurs,
maybe.

501bae2b-2f0f-4e4b-aa17-ce1f506d36aa-0
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.530
In the background, there's a
there's a polar bear enclosure.

fc2d5e7d-118d-4d01-b2a0-ed6f2a718bb1-0
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.139
With some of the bears sitting,
and some of the Bears, one of

fc2d5e7d-118d-4d01-b2a0-ed6f2a718bb1-1
00:18:54.139 --> 00:18:56.050
the Bears is in the pool.

9ad3e7a9-d821-422f-9aa9-ec69796d20c7-0
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:04.175
And there's a, there's a tree.
In addition to the leaves in the

9ad3e7a9-d821-422f-9aa9-ec69796d20c7-1
00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:06.760
tree, there's a. There's a.

a270f6bf-80ad-4fa8-bb6b-5b83b1351fb6-0
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:13.600
Funny looking bird in the in the
same tree there's a there's an

a270f6bf-80ad-4fa8-bb6b-5b83b1351fb6-1
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.821
elephant enclosure in the back,
and we also seem an EMU in that

a270f6bf-80ad-4fa8-bb6b-5b83b1351fb6-2
00:19:19.821 --> 00:19:25.069
same enclosure the the elephant
appears to be eating.

b4c34edc-afed-4c44-8988-3696065b3d1b-0
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.020
Something that one of that one
of the zoo goers is.

e7ae268e-53e6-4f75-84c3-ab55f29c072e-0
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.800
Feeding him. There are.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.210
People.

5a42d443-aa40-4fe3-842f-de2afaea3b3d-0
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.628
Standing by the elephant
enclosure, watching one of the

5a42d443-aa40-4fe3-842f-de2afaea3b3d-1
00:19:44.628 --> 00:19:46.620
escaped Penguins that.

0ab34522-1313-41f1-a2d9-659a497a5b8d-0
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.937
It is is doing a dance, has a
has a top hat and is

0ab34522-1313-41f1-a2d9-659a497a5b8d-1
00:19:51.937 --> 00:19:53.510
entertaining the crowd.

0f703b83-784c-4472-a9bd-f377ffd7f080-0
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.630
We also see.

58d83af4-bc96-4f28-a225-5b7f13d72cbd-0
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:05.532
Oh, the, the, the, the Penguin
enclosure. This must be because

58d83af4-bc96-4f28-a225-5b7f13d72cbd-1
00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:09.250
it's empty apart from some some
ice and.

93820af3-fa19-4018-81ec-6bdb3ca54261-0
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.025
But there's a there's, it's,
it's Oval in shape. There's,

93820af3-fa19-4018-81ec-6bdb3ca54261-1
00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:19.420
there's water around the edge,
and then there's this ice.

4bbcbf9f-5155-4465-b7b7-ed022ac85edf-0
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.770
Island with little houses.

ed5e58ca-894d-44d2-9144-21a10d57d164-0
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.722
Well, it's it's one big
structure with little doors that

ed5e58ca-894d-44d2-9144-21a10d57d164-1
00:20:29.722 --> 00:20:33.777
the Penguins presumably live in,
but it's empty. There's, there's

ed5e58ca-894d-44d2-9144-21a10d57d164-2
00:20:33.777 --> 00:20:37.464
there's nothing in it. There
are. There are zoo keepers who

ed5e58ca-894d-44d2-9144-21a10d57d164-3
00:20:37.464 --> 00:20:37.710
are.

6fcefdd4-8f71-4d46-b690-28967533f65f-0
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.004
Seemed to be milling around,
one's got a net. I think they

6fcefdd4-8f71-4d46-b690-28967533f65f-1
00:20:43.004 --> 00:20:45.650
wanted to try and catch to the
the the Penguins.

3e88eeff-280d-4129-be3d-4f3307447538-0
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:54.017
There are also zebras and
flamingos in the same enclosure.

3e88eeff-280d-4129-be3d-4f3307447538-1
00:20:54.017 --> 00:21:00.208
That seems to be pretty normal.
There's a hippo in in the pool

3e88eeff-280d-4129-be3d-4f3307447538-2
00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:05.613
along with the with the
flamingos and the bird sitting

3e88eeff-280d-4129-be3d-4f3307447538-3
00:21:05.613 --> 00:21:08.070
on the back of the hippo.

a04f0f9f-8c78-45c9-b14f-cdfa95e9a56d-0
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.720
Umm.

35991e02-830a-467b-b638-a361c4638ee8-0
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.777
There are we also see a lion
enclosure. Unfortunately, some

35991e02-830a-467b-b638-a361c4638ee8-1
00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.770
children seem to be.

7c6eb5da-0865-4c9e-8d61-9556ff135eaf-0
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.120
Seems to have fallen into the
line enclosure.

5a00dd3c-3756-405b-b40a-fe04a9fbd602-0
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.923
A couple of them are trying to
get out. A couple of them are

5a00dd3c-3756-405b-b40a-fe04a9fbd602-1
00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:30.340
kind of.

d316307b-cd78-4941-a7f3-1c7186016fc9-0
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.764
Down in the bottom one looks
dazed and the other looks really

d316307b-cd78-4941-a7f3-1c7186016fc9-1
00:21:35.764 --> 00:21:40.600
scared and one foolish child is
actually leaping into into the.

df20224d-752b-427a-b629-5078bacab636-0
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.470
Um uh closure.

15ef4fdc-f44a-4397-99fc-5e80b8e21e10-0
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.886
One of the the Lions don't seem
to be reacting to these

15ef4fdc-f44a-4397-99fc-5e80b8e21e10-1
00:21:51.886 --> 00:21:53.870
children, although.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.048
One of them may be licking its
lips, the the the male with the

f2b6809a-47ea-4a7a-b2e0-01b50716297d-1
00:22:00.048 --> 00:22:03.260
with the big mane. There are a
couple of.

cc081929-5fb4-4c85-8b82-8fff5d327a0a-0
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.401
I don't know. Gophers. Prairie
dogs. Something in the holes in

cc081929-5fb4-4c85-8b82-8fff5d327a0a-1
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:11.909
that line enclosure too. And and
the scorpion.

cc081929-5fb4-4c85-8b82-8fff5d327a0a-2
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:13.190
#END_escape_from_the_zoo

e2554f1c-30ba-44f4-abd6-fe4dde231c67-0
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.550
OK, that was about 5 minutes.
That was good.

e353043c-0f2f-45b0-8928-8b385dd450ca-0
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:23.584
So going forward, it's another
story, a different one. This one

e353043c-0f2f-45b0-8928-8b385dd450ca-1
00:22:23.584 --> 00:22:26.020
has around 20 pages. Ohh wow.

a420a605-3212-4b4f-8b1e-f7969b67c9d9-0
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.058
#START_return OK, the dedication
is for my parents. Um, we see a

a420a605-3212-4b4f-8b1e-f7969b67c9d9-1
00:22:34.058 --> 00:22:39.156
a cross section of a house. In
one room and man is sitting at a

a420a605-3212-4b4f-8b1e-f7969b67c9d9-2
00:22:39.156 --> 00:22:44.016
drafting table doing a drawing.
There's a kite also floating

a420a605-3212-4b4f-8b1e-f7969b67c9d9-3
00:22:44.016 --> 00:22:45.530
about in that room.

73887888-cda5-4e5d-b7b5-3efdf6d9f5c1-0
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.349
Although it's not clear what's
keeping it up. Must be windy in

73887888-cda5-4e5d-b7b5-3efdf6d9f5c1-1
00:22:52.349 --> 00:22:53.010
the house.

e3ae41ed-bd12-4c5f-b92b-54eca95bf44b-0
00:22:54.290 --> 00:23:03.878
And then, uh, that's upstairs.
Downstairs there is a boy who is

e3ae41ed-bd12-4c5f-b92b-54eca95bf44b-1
00:23:03.878 --> 00:23:10.770
drawing a a door on the wall. He
has a a red.

bad1ed75-6e7f-43a2-afef-60372a72e855-0
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.409
Crayon that I it seems to be
able to create a door, or so he

bad1ed75-6e7f-43a2-afef-60372a72e855-1
00:23:16.409 --> 00:23:20.849
hopes. And there are two red
things in the room. A, a ball

bad1ed75-6e7f-43a2-afef-60372a72e855-2
00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:25.514
that he's holding and a, looks
like a model of a balloon that

bad1ed75-6e7f-43a2-afef-60372a72e855-3
00:23:25.514 --> 00:23:30.179
is suspended from the ceiling.
There's also a purple thing. I

bad1ed75-6e7f-43a2-afef-60372a72e855-4
00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:34.769
can't really make out what it
is. Suspended from the ceiling

bad1ed75-6e7f-43a2-afef-60372a72e855-5
00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:39.660
next to the next to the balloon
and the rest of the house seems.

534448a2-16ef-453e-8c93-8090b3b5602f-0
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.060
Unremarkable. It's just just the
house.

816b1651-9d41-48a0-9998-599c80c70f11-0
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:54.450
So the the man at the drafting
table notices the kite which has

816b1651-9d41-48a0-9998-599c80c70f11-1
00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.720
fallen to the floor.

bece3035-0406-48c5-88de-d714463c46a6-0
00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.520
Picks it up.

dfef3f77-bcad-42e3-8c3e-a5d88133d75b-0
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.330
And then he puts it down.

ea9828b1-11c1-46ae-bfea-30d22744b367-0
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.350
and he goes down to the other
room where the boy had.

54dbed77-d016-46d1-be33-7d196e136695-0
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.140
had um

ec1b8679-2d79-4431-82a7-4d3ceb923f10-0
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.588
Drawn the door uh, which now is
appears to be a real door, and

ec1b8679-2d79-4431-82a7-4d3ceb923f10-1
00:24:15.588 --> 00:24:20.247
it's open and the boy has
presumably gone through it. We

ec1b8679-2d79-4431-82a7-4d3ceb923f10-2
00:24:20.247 --> 00:24:24.170
we see a a little more detail in
the room. The.

2984750a-8216-4af2-b35a-dfd766913730-0
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.723
The the thing next to the
balloon is in fact a dragonfly,

2984750a-8216-4af2-b35a-dfd766913730-1
00:24:29.723 --> 00:24:32.960
a model of a dragonfly and as a
map of the world.

6e03b56c-05df-47c8-9180-539c4a3c3515-0
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.300
On the wall beneath both of
them.

e9b5b1b5-94f5-4c71-82f1-adb2d1a18c01-0
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:47.163
So the the man also goes through
the door and it turns out he

e9b5b1b5-94f5-4c71-82f1-adb2d1a18c01-1
00:24:47.163 --> 00:24:53.618
goes into a totally other world
where the door appears to be a

e9b5b1b5-94f5-4c71-82f1-adb2d1a18c01-2
00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:57.820
door in in a tree and he's in
this wood.

8eeeb6ed-e4be-43f9-b215-027ef19bf94e-0
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:05.403
Where there are brightly colored
lanterns hanging from the trees,

8eeeb6ed-e4be-43f9-b215-027ef19bf94e-1
00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:06.650
and he sees.

03f147aa-5fa9-4141-a1d6-ff5f1d8e6f86-0
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.780
And there's a stream.

308cca1d-443b-4569-a268-ca88cf7b800c-0
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.983
And on the opposite Bank of the
stream, there's a little dock,

308cca1d-443b-4569-a268-ca88cf7b800c-1
00:25:14.983 --> 00:25:18.917
and on the dock is the red ball
that that which is probably the

308cca1d-443b-4569-a268-ca88cf7b800c-2
00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:22.483
one that the boy had been
holding. But there's no no sign

308cca1d-443b-4569-a268-ca88cf7b800c-3
00:25:22.483 --> 00:25:23.160
of the boy.

570b0731-149c-4d44-845e-c07042c588ad-0
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.310
So the man.

3b8efadd-d85f-4f57-9ff5-1a59d69d5ba6-0
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.956
Crosses the stream, somehow,
gets to that dock and and then a

3b8efadd-d85f-4f57-9ff5-1a59d69d5ba6-1
00:25:34.956 --> 00:25:39.590
boat comes along with a, looks
like a a horse or.

f0f50030-9593-4d19-af8d-96bd99be616e-0
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:46.353
Dragon on the on the prow of the
boat and the big tail on the

f0f50030-9593-4d19-af8d-96bd99be616e-1
00:25:46.353 --> 00:25:46.820
back.

a6903222-fdd4-44c9-9d36-8a4f957a31f9-0
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:53.892
The boat comes up to the dock,
the man gets on it and the the

a6903222-fdd4-44c9-9d36-8a4f957a31f9-1
00:25:53.892 --> 00:25:59.276
boat sets off, taking the man
somewhere. And it takes him to

a6903222-fdd4-44c9-9d36-8a4f957a31f9-2
00:25:59.276 --> 00:26:03.955
a, to a castle. We saw this
castle in the one of the

a6903222-fdd4-44c9-9d36-8a4f957a31f9-3
00:26:03.955 --> 00:26:06.250
previous stories it seems.

4ea70005-d0cb-4f4c-a3d9-536b19795ca2-0
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:08.310
And.

8bd4e547-6e69-4e57-8e78-237efe4faec7-0
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.250
He's he's on a.

0b662d0b-a76c-4278-8246-302fd42632f8-0
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.950
Aqueduct crossing the water.
Well, let's see.

e27e6df4-c90a-4f8e-ae8b-a5bfc040924d-0
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:28.118
Trying to see whether the water
that the man is on on on the

e27e6df4-c90a-4f8e-ae8b-a5bfc040924d-1
00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:33.020
boat is connected. I think it
is. It looks like an archway

e27e6df4-c90a-4f8e-ae8b-a5bfc040924d-2
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.005
that goes through to a broader
set of water and across that

e27e6df4-c90a-4f8e-ae8b-a5bfc040924d-3
00:26:38.005 --> 00:26:42.990
broader water, the the boy is
crossing an aqueduct in a red

e27e6df4-c90a-4f8e-ae8b-a5bfc040924d-4
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.394
boat and the scene is
illuminated by a a bright full

e27e6df4-c90a-4f8e-ae8b-a5bfc040924d-5
00:26:47.394 --> 00:26:47.810
moon.

e51a0125-1cf1-4c54-8bc9-795f7aa33697-0
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.650
So the the man.

40b4afe5-c15e-4914-97fc-c488e25eb2f1-0
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:55.940
Um.

c92f9fb3-f2f7-4a8c-9a92-c9c7a590b7a7-0
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:04.350
The the, the the the boat
carrying the man somehow gets to

c92f9fb3-f2f7-4a8c-9a92-c9c7a590b7a7-1
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:10.787
the same place as where the
where the boy is and we see the

c92f9fb3-f2f7-4a8c-9a92-c9c7a590b7a7-2
00:27:10.787 --> 00:27:17.440
the man jumping out of the boat
onto a a dock and running up.

fce55040-4aea-41d9-970b-56fcecc28684-0
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.590
The, uh towards.

82bbd46f-997e-426e-9892-1fa09a65b790-0
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.550
The boy.

207c8f91-cb94-45a1-8e32-bf5ae84fb80a-0
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.800
And.

fede3697-01fb-4f84-8f34-2dcbebd7ff3e-0
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.110
Um.

2e5dc6a0-09d2-45a2-8176-c14f073d7e30-0
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.964
I'm not completely sure whether
it was the boy or the girl. So

2e5dc6a0-09d2-45a2-8176-c14f073d7e30-1
00:27:30.964 --> 00:27:31.420
so the.

8dbc16e9-ba39-46d1-8f59-6d8e9ca3a029-0
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.268
As in the previous story, we saw
this. Uh, there's a boy in a

8dbc16e9-ba39-46d1-8f59-6d8e9ca3a029-1
00:27:37.268 --> 00:27:40.410
striped shirt and a girl in a in
a white shirt.

2a6c7a9d-0653-4c08-8230-cad720b8898e-0
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.008
And it might be that the the man
was following the girl rather

2a6c7a9d-0653-4c08-8230-cad720b8898e-1
00:27:47.008 --> 00:27:51.791
than the rather than boy. I've
forgotten what kind of shirt the

2a6c7a9d-0653-4c08-8230-cad720b8898e-2
00:27:51.791 --> 00:27:56.575
the child had, but in any case,
they're they're they're the the

2a6c7a9d-0653-4c08-8230-cad720b8898e-3
00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:59.489
girl is running up some steps
towards.

9db1f0c9-cb7b-412e-958b-85d2cc247c3f-0
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:07.163
The boy and the the king that
we've previously seen with the

9db1f0c9-cb7b-412e-958b-85d2cc247c3f-1
00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:09.980
with the Purple bird and.

a50b117e-3e1a-40a7-985f-a2917953c2b2-0
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.140
He he he gets there the the.

49dcbdb9-60cc-452f-b95a-091a9045c9b5-0
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.490
And he's asking the king, I
think, what's going on?

f0cc40fb-c212-4d3f-bf4b-46a47bca5654-0
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.680
The boy.

c03f4812-6b24-4ae8-9b2e-60b0c16e85ca-0
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.620
Umm is is there with the purple
bird sitting on his shoulder,

c03f4812-6b24-4ae8-9b2e-60b0c16e85ca-1
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.343
and the the girl. So it must
have been the girl that he was

c03f4812-6b24-4ae8-9b2e-60b0c16e85ca-2
00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:41.303
following all along because she
has the red crayon in her hand

c03f4812-6b24-4ae8-9b2e-60b0c16e85ca-3
00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:42.719
and and she's not.

71140b15-507d-4bf2-ad94-2541a638d438-0
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.532
Pleased with this intervention,
she doesn't really want anything

71140b15-507d-4bf2-ad94-2541a638d438-1
00:28:48.532 --> 00:28:51.920
to do with the man who is I I
think probably her father.

c7b42a47-4c7f-4144-9a19-44d5701dbd36-0
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.050
And.

6aa51f74-eac3-416e-a5f0-967667fa4c93-0
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.932
One of the detail is that both
the boy and the girl are wearing

6aa51f74-eac3-416e-a5f0-967667fa4c93-1
00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:04.516
crowns similar to those slightly
smaller than the crown that the

6aa51f74-eac3-416e-a5f0-967667fa4c93-2
00:29:04.516 --> 00:29:09.170
king is wearing, and the girl is
standing next to a throne which.

cbf89e58-d986-4127-a989-242919d0aeb3-0
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.075
That is probably the throne for
the for the king. Although it

cbf89e58-d986-4127-a989-242919d0aeb3-1
00:29:14.075 --> 00:29:17.357
has several seats. In fact, it
has three seats, probably one

cbf89e58-d986-4127-a989-242919d0aeb3-2
00:29:17.357 --> 00:29:20.369
for the king and one for each
for the boy and the girl.

05be9713-6e78-4fab-9a10-20f49fedd325-0
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:22.930
OK.

3c0ed978-f60b-42d1-af89-bf72b141f59d-0
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.600
So.

50e1356d-8226-40d3-b54e-aa908bb502a0-0
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.260
Into the scene.

d3d8cbe0-dd08-4c08-b867-eb948fc14034-0
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.040
Uh.

7fdd5937-33aa-498f-a9a5-14c44b6c7dee-0
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.485
Benches another boat similar to
the one that the man came in.

7fdd5937-33aa-498f-a9a5-14c44b6c7dee-1
00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:43.642
But there are soldiers on this
boat and it's probably the same

7fdd5937-33aa-498f-a9a5-14c44b6c7dee-2
00:29:43.642 --> 00:29:48.799
lot of soldiers that. Oh no, so
it's the same boat and the the

7fdd5937-33aa-498f-a9a5-14c44b6c7dee-3
00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:53.875
soldiers come out of a door in
the front of the boat that had

7fdd5937-33aa-498f-a9a5-14c44b6c7dee-4
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:58.541
not previously been opened. And
the the the soldiers are

7fdd5937-33aa-498f-a9a5-14c44b6c7dee-5
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:02.880
probably attacking the king, but
the king holds out.

4f9e5dae-77c7-4ed7-b77a-7c5eb4df1dcc-0
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:03.590
a

4107b0f4-3c87-4ca8-b276-936b736850b6-0
00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.196
A pen. I think it's one of these
magic pens he's gonna Draw

4107b0f4-3c87-4ca8-b276-936b736850b6-1
00:30:08.196 --> 00:30:09.010
Something with.

c04189e1-150b-414c-ae49-9f978a10e6cb-0
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:17.120
And is basically acting in
defense of the the boy and the

c04189e1-150b-414c-ae49-9f978a10e6cb-1
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.410
girl and the father.

e947bb07-3490-4c33-826e-192421d09f90-0
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.950
So he draws.

63b0cabd-2681-47de-96dd-206bcbae9795-0
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:31.570
A sword and he uses this sword
to fend off.

adbed1e3-7da9-40e9-a6d4-4608bc0a8f78-0
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:38.435
The the soldiers who are
attacking, but one of the

adbed1e3-7da9-40e9-a6d4-4608bc0a8f78-1
00:30:38.435 --> 00:30:45.191
soldiers has a machine with a a
crank handle and the the

adbed1e3-7da9-40e9-a6d4-4608bc0a8f78-2
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:46.140
soldier.

2d1540d1-1f5f-47e5-9385-988231414200-0
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.470
Turns the crank.

8d9c4e69-3947-4171-808a-200a5507ab47-0
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.360
And it.

f5277e6e-180c-4b53-abfd-529ae8561c36-0
00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.087
It it swallows the sword and the
magic pen that the king has

f5277e6e-180c-4b53-abfd-529ae8561c36-1
00:31:00.087 --> 00:31:06.408
used. So now the king is is
defenseless, and two soldiers

f5277e6e-180c-4b53-abfd-529ae8561c36-2
00:31:06.408 --> 00:31:11.530
grab the king while the the the
first soldier.

60af06ad-ffb9-4a6c-b145-6c9bf35b6807-0
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:19.890
Continues on with his with his
magic grinding box that he's

60af06ad-ffb9-4a6c-b145-6c9bf35b6807-1
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:25.923
presumably carrying following
the the man and his his two

60af06ad-ffb9-4a6c-b145-6c9bf35b6807-2
00:31:25.923 --> 00:31:26.860
children.

42da3273-e7be-408b-8f43-a6632407c6a2-0
00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:35.010
But the the boy still has a
magic pen and he draws.

1604c254-8c05-4490-83fa-3986afb0e06c-0
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:43.616
A horse it's like a a a Griffin
with it's it's the it's got it's

1604c254-8c05-4490-83fa-3986afb0e06c-1
00:31:43.616 --> 00:31:51.372
got wings it's got feet shaped
like a horse but the the head is

1604c254-8c05-4490-83fa-3986afb0e06c-2
00:31:51.372 --> 00:31:58.642
more like a a bird or a dragon.
But anyway these these this

1604c254-8c05-4490-83fa-3986afb0e06c-3
00:31:58.642 --> 00:31:59.370
magic.

5fb0ae06-e2bc-431c-a7a0-770e30a4e54e-0
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.560
Horse.

0c81f32d-a5c5-498a-9983-6d9d6e5edfda-0
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:07.050
Flies away and saves them from
the soldier with the with the

0c81f32d-a5c5-498a-9983-6d9d6e5edfda-1
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.310
magic grinder.

edb43672-3a29-44f2-bccc-6c1ce59936b4-0
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:14.930
So.

3ecde2a7-19e4-4857-a5a4-90f13aeff766-0
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:16.890
Now.

ff357d7c-1051-44b3-84ac-01921131c9e7-0
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:26.010
The magic, the the soldier with
the magic grinder.

d4006127-3398-4ebe-8e66-8d62fe5e9218-0
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.850
is on.

49cbb2d9-2561-4093-a72a-40668a62ef0e-0
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:36.262
The boat which has turned into a
flying machine and he's chasing

49cbb2d9-2561-4093-a72a-40668a62ef0e-1
00:32:36.262 --> 00:32:36.710
them.

30abd1d0-eafc-4b4b-b992-6afc1b109f2a-0
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:41.780
And he uses his magic grinder to
grind up.

2fd9909c-0bc6-4e5b-aea7-d26460315ba4-0
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.935
The the creature that the boy
and the girl and the father are

2fd9909c-0bc6-4e5b-aea7-d26460315ba4-1
00:32:47.935 --> 00:32:49.620
are flying away on.

fc5ee3af-6276-48ad-8f14-2f06d32df786-0
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.940
And it's it's succeeding. The
the wing is getting.

815c0377-2318-4d97-962d-9c50fbd2d551-0
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.576
chewed up and the the magic pen
that the boy has is is snatched

815c0377-2318-4d97-962d-9c50fbd2d551-1
00:33:01.576 --> 00:33:06.110
away from him into this grinder,
so they're up in the air. So now

815c0377-2318-4d97-962d-9c50fbd2d551-2
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.690
what's going to happen?

1638e8f9-513e-4c90-a097-b28d70c4870f-0
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.430
And in fact.

9af7fcb6-76c4-4a76-9314-5570bb0c3b63-0
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.080
The the creature is completely.

75e29952-0b96-461c-9649-cbf76ff527ed-0
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.508
Destroyed. There are all kinds
of feathers getting sucked into

75e29952-0b96-461c-9649-cbf76ff527ed-1
00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:24.530
this magic grinder.

d08f8ec1-3b58-4480-a745-237d6873e1e8-0
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.840


3ad2eb85-dbd2-4c1e-96d4-1dfdfbec6944-0
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:34.798
The king, who is on board this
flying ship, grabs the boy as he

3ad2eb85-dbd2-4c1e-96d4-1dfdfbec6944-1
00:33:34.798 --> 00:33:36.070
falls off.

b23ff884-7dba-4e62-b6b0-d6138a103d65-0
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.160
But the the father and the girl.

5d4b09ae-eda2-40d0-91df-f57ece0bdc4b-0
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:47.377
Um fall together. The father's
holding on to the girl. The

5d4b09ae-eda2-40d0-91df-f57ece0bdc4b-1
00:33:47.377 --> 00:33:52.849
girl's crown is falling off, but
the girl has a magic pen in her

5d4b09ae-eda2-40d0-91df-f57ece0bdc4b-2
00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:58.153
hand, and she has the the purple
bird tucked under her arm. So

5d4b09ae-eda2-40d0-91df-f57ece0bdc4b-3
00:33:58.153 --> 00:34:03.037
now they're they're falling
through the air and they fall

5d4b09ae-eda2-40d0-91df-f57ece0bdc4b-4
00:34:03.037 --> 00:34:04.300
into the water.

234913ae-f2a7-49a5-a0e0-27ca1d750021-0
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.952
So they don't, they don't hit
anything solid and they're

234913ae-f2a7-49a5-a0e0-27ca1d750021-1
00:34:10.952 --> 00:34:16.534
falling down, down in the water.
But whilst they do, the girl

234913ae-f2a7-49a5-a0e0-27ca1d750021-2
00:34:16.534 --> 00:34:22.207
starts drawing something that
looks like a bottle and in which

234913ae-f2a7-49a5-a0e0-27ca1d750021-3
00:34:22.207 --> 00:34:27.969
she and her father and the bird
are contained, but in fact it's

234913ae-f2a7-49a5-a0e0-27ca1d750021-4
00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:28.330
not.

6b20a679-8ab2-4d6a-b805-2bcfed6d4eb0-0
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.664
A bottle. It's a submarine and
the the they navigate In this

6b20a679-8ab2-4d6a-b805-2bcfed6d4eb0-1
00:34:35.664 --> 00:34:41.196
submarine. The girl is looking
through a Periscope, guiding

6b20a679-8ab2-4d6a-b805-2bcfed6d4eb0-2
00:34:41.196 --> 00:34:46.451
where they are and the father is
down below driving this

6b20a679-8ab2-4d6a-b805-2bcfed6d4eb0-3
00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:50.140
submarine and guiding its its
progress.

f04f8546-1b06-472d-ab34-2da9e0d27292-0
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:57.630
So they they surface in the
submarine, they surface in this.

541e5797-6b3f-4081-b319-f23a75d75555-0
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.360
In this cave.

c38e0ad2-cac6-4487-8536-4fba7f30fad4-0
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:07.744
In this in the sea, so it's a
kind of indentation of the of

c38e0ad2-cac6-4487-8536-4fba7f30fad4-1
00:35:07.744 --> 00:35:13.545
the sea with with water, but
it's, it's, it's, it's sheltered

c38e0ad2-cac6-4487-8536-4fba7f30fad4-2
00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:19.065
as a cave and on the walls of
this cave there are a lot of

c38e0ad2-cac6-4487-8536-4fba7f30fad4-3
00:35:19.065 --> 00:35:22.060
drawings of of people and boats.

a33e5611-0765-4cad-8fa9-be262bc16e91-0
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:23.910
And.

ebe7682d-fe61-444e-b811-732c9033ffac-0
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.260
Uh.

a53e424d-1ac8-48d5-ad30-aa83e5b458e1-0
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:28.570
Door, design as a door.

f324f9a6-d571-4903-8137-6f40bd404d0c-0
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:30.550
And.

f8c8bd6e-d21d-45d2-8da3-75833633c09d-0
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.217
So there's been a lot of cave
drawing on the spot and the the

f8c8bd6e-d21d-45d2-8da3-75833633c09d-1
00:35:38.217 --> 00:35:44.106
boy, the father and the girl are
looking at this, and the purple

f8c8bd6e-d21d-45d2-8da3-75833633c09d-2
00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:47.730
bird is flying around near their
heads.

008c0168-fd8d-4f2d-a2f0-4b4f98f01b03-0
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.472
So now they get off the
submarine and go further into

008c0168-fd8d-4f2d-a2f0-4b4f98f01b03-1
00:35:56.472 --> 00:36:01.469
The Cave where they're they're
looking at a drawing which

008c0168-fd8d-4f2d-a2f0-4b4f98f01b03-2
00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:07.069
appears to show somebody with a
magic grinder sucking things up,

008c0168-fd8d-4f2d-a2f0-4b4f98f01b03-3
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:12.411
and somebody else with a magic
pen that is not getting sucked

008c0168-fd8d-4f2d-a2f0-4b4f98f01b03-4
00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:12.669
up.

8190cb86-dc08-45b1-9bd6-b8d2877f1e45-0
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.590
um standing in front of them,
and the the girl points this out

8190cb86-dc08-45b1-9bd6-b8d2877f1e45-1
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.060
to the to the father.

c1283f9a-f463-4c7f-b024-ac8d6bf0c14c-0
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:26.758
Who is little bemused by all
these. And the purple bird is

c1283f9a-f463-4c7f-b024-ac8d6bf0c14c-1
00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:32.920
still standing by and you see in
the bottom left of the picture a

c1283f9a-f463-4c7f-b024-ac8d6bf0c14c-2
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.616
door in in the rock, which is
probably going to be somewhere

c1283f9a-f463-4c7f-b024-ac8d6bf0c14c-3
00:36:38.616 --> 00:36:40.390
they go, I predict.

23d20815-503e-4401-9a18-5619bc0b8d5e-0
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:43.960
Uh, but I'm wrong.

295ee0ec-3ab4-4ebe-ae4f-9cdeb8192ee0-0
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:52.167
Because what happens next is
coming up to this cave is are

295ee0ec-3ab4-4ebe-ae4f-9cdeb8192ee0-1
00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:55.960
the soldiers with the magic
grinder.

1d65dc79-92c0-4352-82ad-3623980b9aeb-0
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.480
And.

42194f27-8553-4718-b139-92d3449a22f2-0
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:05.881
So and which the vessel has now
turned back into a into a boat.

42194f27-8553-4718-b139-92d3449a22f2-1
00:37:05.881 --> 00:37:12.054
And they they float in and the
girl and the father hide behind

42194f27-8553-4718-b139-92d3449a22f2-2
00:37:12.054 --> 00:37:12.740
a rock.

1a4c303e-5add-405a-8bc0-e456e75ce6e7-0
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.984
And there's a little more detail
in the picture, which shows in

1a4c303e-5add-405a-8bc0-e456e75ce6e7-1
00:37:20.984 --> 00:37:27.510
addition to the grinder, the the
the rock picture, so there's a.

25b2a40f-874f-4917-9184-290817fe9498-0
00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:34.430
Not quite sure it shows. It
shows a person and a plant and.

108c3977-8108-4654-afd6-2eac1f9afc13-0
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.974
The person standing in the
doorway and looking at the

108c3977-8108-4654-afd6-2eac1f9afc13-1
00:37:37.974 --> 00:37:40.828
plant. But anyway, they they
soldiers are after them and

108c3977-8108-4654-afd6-2eac1f9afc13-2
00:37:40.828 --> 00:37:41.980
they're hiding so that.

3971e855-887a-41b0-9780-cd264eccbbae-0
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:50.020
The father now gets in on the
act and he starts drawing.

0a6bb2bd-f2fa-45a6-9491-b994d3b783d8-0
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:55.400
a, drawing something. It's,
it's, it's a.

14e8092d-2cc0-4511-b22e-88349c410484-0
00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.630
A door or A frame with a swing
for the for the bird.

af3f2f54-c861-437d-a3bc-4b74c3f105b1-0
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.469
Not clear what's going to is
going to do, but let's move on

af3f2f54-c861-437d-a3bc-4b74c3f105b1-1
00:38:07.469 --> 00:38:07.920
and see.

cea5331d-e755-41eb-88a6-cf4c06c72e6b-0
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.580
So.

29718a45-7b97-4f6f-9416-8fc0729b865b-0
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.930
It turns out to be a.

c33d491d-886f-4b5e-ad0b-249c24fe19cc-0
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:19.165
It's basically a trap that the
the bird is the sitting on this

c33d491d-886f-4b5e-ad0b-249c24fe19cc-1
00:38:19.165 --> 00:38:24.060
swing in the middle of this
structure. It's, it's the bait

c33d491d-886f-4b5e-ad0b-249c24fe19cc-2
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.203
and the the soldier with the
magic grinder rushes up and he's

c33d491d-886f-4b5e-ad0b-249c24fe19cc-3
00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:32.770
trying to grind up the bird. But
there is.

abe7f967-5525-480a-aef2-2a957271fc11-0
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:40.326
There are four doors on this
structure which are let down as

abe7f967-5525-480a-aef2-2a957271fc11-1
00:38:40.326 --> 00:38:45.520
ramps, but as the soldier rushes
into the structure.

a9297d71-7657-49ce-9b1a-8d7828ac0d38-0
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:52.730
The ramp the the the the ramps
close up and turn this.

30a06760-d6ee-44be-ba18-547113d49400-0
00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:01.909
Structure into a into a cage for
the soldier and he, in in the in

30a06760-d6ee-44be-ba18-547113d49400-1
00:39:01.909 --> 00:39:05.550
the process drops or is has the.

88e2423d-fdf1-457d-b706-7a098f7b719b-0
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:13.060
Magic Grinder pulled away from
them. I think it's because he he

88e2423d-fdf1-457d-b706-7a098f7b719b-1
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.292
ground up the the bird, but the
bird is still somehow intact.

88e2423d-fdf1-457d-b706-7a098f7b719b-2
00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:23.440
And so, so now the soldier is
trapped in a cage and it looks

88e2423d-fdf1-457d-b706-7a098f7b719b-3
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.588
like the father is going to
throw the the grinder at the the

88e2423d-fdf1-457d-b706-7a098f7b719b-4
00:39:28.588 --> 00:39:29.010
cage.

9ed06ed9-e4ef-4995-9e21-1f8c89a3429e-0
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.752
But. And so maybe to break it.
But the the girl is alarmed by

9ed06ed9-e4ef-4995-9e21-1f8c89a3429e-1
00:39:34.752 --> 00:39:35.120
that.

283c124f-222e-4b53-b230-31b81b865751-0
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.900
And he does. He's, he he throws
it down and.

540bdddf-fe86-4bb8-ab8a-714fc1e3c9fa-0
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:49.333
The grinder explodes, and all
the stuff that's been ground up

540bdddf-fe86-4bb8-ab8a-714fc1e3c9fa-1
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:55.350
in it flows out in a tremendous
explosion of creatures and

540bdddf-fe86-4bb8-ab8a-714fc1e3c9fa-2
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:56.369
artifacts.

cf95aca9-3d41-40f4-a1cd-a2bcb7c1bcca-0
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.580
Including the the purple.

000b7e9f-e06c-4eec-b11d-d274df67244e-0
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.970
Bird.

29b83700-0c8b-4b07-a87b-00eb4d4296d5-0
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:09.750
The the King and the and the boy
who'd been on the boat.

6eb90031-4458-4e01-8fcd-0b79c1264c67-0
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.477
Run towards them. These, the two
soldiers who are holding them

6eb90031-4458-4e01-8fcd-0b79c1264c67-1
00:40:15.477 --> 00:40:16.040
captive.

b3e4f60f-aab2-4baf-8057-a82af94875f4-0
00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.220
Are very scared.

0bfd9548-6a09-441a-95f0-21e8b2e63f0e-0
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:24.790
As is the the the the soldier
who is operating the grinder

0bfd9548-6a09-441a-95f0-21e8b2e63f0e-1
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.580
who's still in the cage.

3ffa5797-d25a-4c5d-95ee-a7cf5ef25797-0
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.910
So now.

821907bd-0be9-48d0-b72f-66fabbb9587b-0
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.520
This, this the soldiers.

4252ac92-b3ce-4d9e-b504-8fd4b83fa457-0
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:49.560
Go off on this on this boat
seemingly defeated. Oh and one

4252ac92-b3ce-4d9e-b504-8fd4b83fa457-1
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.370
of the.

345ab895-2aec-493c-aff6-7f331bdb189d-0
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:56.331
Things that came out of the
grinder this dragon like

345ab895-2aec-493c-aff6-7f331bdb189d-1
00:40:56.331 --> 00:41:02.107
creature which is taking the
cage with the with the Grinder

345ab895-2aec-493c-aff6-7f331bdb189d-2
00:41:02.107 --> 00:41:06.150
soldier in it. He was flying off
to some.

60875ed4-dd09-4b86-9329-1260da6c6c0a-0
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:13.270
Unknown place, but it's it's
probably not good. And the

2a43e1b5-070f-40f6-b159-b3a634d8cfbb-0
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:20.754
The the The the King and the boy
and the girl and the father

2a43e1b5-070f-40f6-b159-b3a634d8cfbb-1
00:41:20.754 --> 00:41:22.350
watched them recede.

83514f5c-bbdb-48f3-b423-4d10dd2272a5-0
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.470
The girl is is happy to see her
father and he's.

a6d26a6f-09c3-401c-8ac2-13a9dbe33d69-0
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.080
Uh, she she gives him a a big
hug.

8f6bdf01-8499-47ac-a912-af9fd7a110b3-0
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:41.157
And the, the, the door that we
saw previously is now partially

8f6bdf01-8499-47ac-a912-af9fd7a110b3-1
00:41:41.157 --> 00:41:46.695
open and it probably leads back
to the to the real world that

8f6bdf01-8499-47ac-a912-af9fd7a110b3-2
00:41:46.695 --> 00:41:51.608
the father came from. And you
see the tail of the kite

8f6bdf01-8499-47ac-a912-af9fd7a110b3-3
00:41:51.608 --> 00:41:54.019
sticking through that door.

7d76c047-c46a-4933-bf2e-11c07449717a-0
00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.569
Looks like the the boy is gonna
stay with the king and maybe the

7d76c047-c46a-4933-bf2e-11c07449717a-1
00:41:59.569 --> 00:42:03.525
the girl is going to go back
with the with the father, but

7d76c047-c46a-4933-bf2e-11c07449717a-2
00:42:03.525 --> 00:42:04.800
that's how it ends.

30f86c9f-7ef5-4625-9659-9ae152236620-0
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.200
Uh.

ae934626-22e7-460b-9be9-ff0d56041bee-0
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.470
And that they have.

baf945cc-5dd8-4879-b8d8-48f3f5dde808-0
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.917
The, uh, the door into the
draft, the the place in the

baf945cc-5dd8-4879-b8d8-48f3f5dde808-1
00:42:19.917 --> 00:42:25.756
house where the father was
working on the drafting table.

baf945cc-5dd8-4879-b8d8-48f3f5dde808-2
00:42:25.756 --> 00:42:30.991
But you see outside a kite
flying, and I think it's

baf945cc-5dd8-4879-b8d8-48f3f5dde808-3
00:42:30.991 --> 00:42:37.536
probably the the father and the
girl in the park flying the kite

baf945cc-5dd8-4879-b8d8-48f3f5dde808-4
00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:42.569
together. #END_return OK, so
that was the story. 

dc116fc2-64da-4cc4-877c-21a510b19e6c-0
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:48.232
OK, so this next one is another
part of the graphic novel. It

dc116fc2-64da-4cc4-877c-21a510b19e6c-1
00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.290
has four pages.

b9a9dce1-c204-4a35-9025-4b0830bf9b55-0
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.340
OK.

66bc0381-c43b-42ab-ba64-de8d41673404-0
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.070
OK.

db42c23c-d21e-4f92-a2d1-d1cb3e962e08-0
00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:01.592
#START_arrival_5 OK, so now
we're back to the first story

db42c23c-d21e-4f92-a2d1-d1cb3e962e08-1
00:43:01.592 --> 00:43:07.141
with this this wild and
wonderful city with houses and

db42c23c-d21e-4f92-a2d1-d1cb3e962e08-2
00:43:07.141 --> 00:43:13.094
and strange sculptures of
strange creatures. And there are

db42c23c-d21e-4f92-a2d1-d1cb3e962e08-3
00:43:13.094 --> 00:43:18.240
birds flying in the sky. And
there are. There are.

45f213ec-d89b-4216-9c56-bd49053e4db9-0
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:22.280
Boats on a on a ramp down by the
sea.

98c622fc-5da9-481c-9a19-4e45e2d33187-0
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.430
And and we we then see the.

ff7458f9-36e6-483f-926e-f4bd0698664f-0
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.150
um the father.

ac24d588-9798-4664-98e9-187be55f0f9c-0
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:42.493
Uh, maybe tying up a a boat or
to a post and then leading the

ac24d588-9798-4664-98e9-187be55f0f9c-1
00:43:42.493 --> 00:43:45.770
the man, the original man.

c01e8a85-bc8f-4aac-9f59-8e2e6d5fb21e-0
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.560
Uh, somewhere.

97826abf-5dbc-4520-b4df-b9dd1cfc7805-0
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.380
He basically says We've arrived
and come this way, and they're

97826abf-5dbc-4520-b4df-b9dd1cfc7805-1
00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.360
preceded by.

ab80d22b-0a62-4f80-8457-df4f1dea332d-0
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:04.458
The the mouse like creature and
the cat like creature and the

ab80d22b-0a62-4f80-8457-df4f1dea332d-1
00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:07.710
boy carrying a basket. The the
boy.

d98124dc-4f51-4999-b79f-7057d9a14d95-0
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:14.650
Takes the basket and gives it to
a, a woman who is probably his

d98124dc-4f51-4999-b79f-7057d9a14d95-1
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.940
mother and the.

68d13358-ae60-43d2-8614-77fdf2dc7642-0
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:22.762
The man, uh hugs, the the woman
who's probably his wife, and the

68d13358-ae60-43d2-8614-77fdf2dc7642-1
00:44:22.762 --> 00:44:25.140
the man and the the wife.

886e4c9f-e84e-4bfc-9f6b-618a5e7de4d5-0
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:34.804
It's gonna be confusing when I
say the man. The father and his

886e4c9f-e84e-4bfc-9f6b-618a5e7de4d5-1
00:44:34.804 --> 00:44:41.353
his wife greet the the man and
say his welcome. In fact, they

886e4c9f-e84e-4bfc-9f6b-618a5e7de4d5-2
00:44:41.353 --> 00:44:47.586
give him a drink and they both,
they all clink glasses and

886e4c9f-e84e-4bfc-9f6b-618a5e7de4d5-3
00:44:47.586 --> 00:44:48.220
toast.

4664e2e9-6d36-48e8-9fa3-8135370ebe87-0
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:56.381
So the the woman then starts to
prepare the the food and it

4664e2e9-6d36-48e8-9fa3-8135370ebe87-1
00:44:56.381 --> 00:44:59.930
looks like they're going to
have.

d9f5d7d1-205f-4101-8a7b-e556755a1fbb-0
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.890
Have a meal together.

51098a4c-5341-4b23-bc9b-22329cb06348-0
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.760
So yes, indeed.

0b4507d4-8b64-4b0e-82dc-7d6106abab8e-0
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.270
They they the wife is.

3a5975e3-fc92-44a1-ad2e-efa7567d9ec9-0
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:23.983
Talking to the to the man and
maybe explaining something about

3a5975e3-fc92-44a1-ad2e-efa7567d9ec9-1
00:45:23.983 --> 00:45:30.096
the the food. The boy is is also
sitting at the table but he's

3a5975e3-fc92-44a1-ad2e-efa7567d9ec9-2
00:45:30.096 --> 00:45:35.239
feeding the the mouse like
creature and the cat like

3a5975e3-fc92-44a1-ad2e-efa7567d9ec9-3
00:45:35.239 --> 00:45:41.062
creature. The father is looks
like he's roasting one of the

3a5975e3-fc92-44a1-ad2e-efa7567d9ec9-4
00:45:41.062 --> 00:45:43.100
food items with this.

a55178d9-5e8b-43a8-bdfd-eaf1b2d95df1-0
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:47.280
I don't know, this gas flame.

d87d62ea-b492-48ec-affe-050e30f2f3dd-0
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:48.530
Umm.

5731d562-a4fa-4d79-b686-aa9f7ffb56bd-0
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:53.898
And uh, so they're all having a
jolly time that the, the, the,

5731d562-a4fa-4d79-b686-aa9f7ffb56bd-1
00:45:53.898 --> 00:45:57.853
the the father is saying
something. His his wife, let's

5731d562-a4fa-4d79-b686-aa9f7ffb56bd-2
00:45:57.853 --> 00:46:02.090
call him, let's call her the
mother. But the mother is, is,

5731d562-a4fa-4d79-b686-aa9f7ffb56bd-3
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.220
is, is laughing.

a1068967-98fe-411d-bd2e-870f381e4fd6-0
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:09.644
Man seems happy. The Ohh and now
the the father gets out of

a1068967-98fe-411d-bd2e-870f381e4fd6-1
00:46:09.644 --> 00:46:14.657
musical instrument, looks like a
little like an accordion with

a1068967-98fe-411d-bd2e-870f381e4fd6-2
00:46:14.657 --> 00:46:19.749
big horns coming out of it, and
the mother gets out a different

a1068967-98fe-411d-bd2e-870f381e4fd6-3
00:46:19.749 --> 00:46:24.284
instrument, a flute like
instrument and the boy gets out

a1068967-98fe-411d-bd2e-870f381e4fd6-4
00:46:24.284 --> 00:46:28.900
a banjo like instrument and
they're all playing together.

8a4160f7-a5fc-4d39-b0cf-475ccfa4b7b2-0
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.020
Now the.

6499def0-0316-4c88-b3f7-980f71268028-0
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:35.740
The man.

87d89608-1209-45b5-8bc5-6c7faa54b4c6-0
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:43.011
Gets out a piece of paper and I
think he does like origami and

87d89608-1209-45b5-8bc5-6c7faa54b4c6-1
00:46:43.011 --> 00:46:47.662
makes a creature out of it that
looks like the cat like

87d89608-1209-45b5-8bc5-6c7faa54b4c6-2
00:46:47.662 --> 00:46:48.410
creature.

0e011ce2-19bb-474b-bc71-605db1a036fd-0
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.940
And.

228f3355-e7ad-4fb6-a796-ce26676a13cb-0
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.500
The.

273f4d8e-cc20-4929-a9ce-511122ddb1a3-0
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.030
The father pulls out of.

b7520186-925d-465d-90c0-663e24472842-0
00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.110
The the wall a pot of some kind.

b2bee35c-d1a4-4400-a27f-fc025ba857e6-0
00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:06.433
And the the mother and the
father both hold this pot

b2bee35c-d1a4-4400-a27f-fc025ba857e6-1
00:47:06.433 --> 00:47:11.133
together and it's like they're
going to present it to the to

b2bee35c-d1a4-4400-a27f-fc025ba857e6-2
00:47:11.133 --> 00:47:14.369
the man and we see a close up of
the pot.

28851ad3-4146-4a5d-b767-2b59a8b63db2-0
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.310
Uh, and then?

2d493b75-f68d-48a1-987f-05af2119a066-0
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:19.940
The pot.

ac43a610-60ad-48f3-a866-0a4fce4dd8bd-0
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:25.620
We go further away from the pot
and the pot seems to be in a

aa72a501-16ca-4d6a-8a07-d474f868aecd-0
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.970
Picture so it's.

465d6dc0-3d2b-4e0f-9a82-096d782abbea-0
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:37.319
It's it's in the in a picture
frame and the man in fact wakes

465d6dc0-3d2b-4e0f-9a82-096d782abbea-1
00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:43.035
up from his sleep, so maybe he's
been dreaming a lot of this, but

465d6dc0-3d2b-4e0f-9a82-096d782abbea-2
00:47:43.035 --> 00:47:47.020
the he still has the the mouse
like creature.

e8e998c9-c01c-45d5-8f96-49f826ea4665-0
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:54.443
Near him and it's uh, I think
the mouse like creature is is

e8e998c9-c01c-45d5-8f96-49f826ea4665-1
00:47:54.443 --> 00:47:56.500
licking him almost like a dog.

ca05ed16-8dc9-45f7-a246-f468ec39ceb3-0
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:03.704
So he gets up, he puts on his
shirt and he cuts up a vegetable

ca05ed16-8dc9-45f7-a246-f468ec39ceb3-1
00:48:03.704 --> 00:48:09.440
of some kind and he's feeding it
to the mouse like creature.

b2578319-9413-4b2d-878d-0b956dea843b-0
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:16.077
And he puts on his coat, and
then the the creature brings him

b2578319-9413-4b2d-878d-0b956dea843b-1
00:48:16.077 --> 00:48:17.110
his his hat.

5a584dab-0eaa-4dd5-855e-b4c2bb3adaca-0
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.410
And he's probably going to go
somewhere. So off he goes.

3925c021-545c-484c-9a0e-19281755a377-0
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:30.041
With the creature following him
and there are a lot of other

3925c021-545c-484c-9a0e-19281755a377-1
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.750
people on on the street.

5a807fc4-a499-4a51-b5fe-1ce4b1d45451-0
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:38.641
There's another man with a with
a. It's like a duck and and

5a807fc4-a499-4a51-b5fe-1ce4b1d45451-1
00:48:38.641 --> 00:48:39.520
there are.

8cd11b60-8b3c-4710-baeb-92ae2d11f966-0
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:48.331
Birds in in the sky and it's the
scene there's washing on a line

8cd11b60-8b3c-4710-baeb-92ae2d11f966-1
00:48:48.331 --> 00:48:50.190
across the street.

f5c38d5c-00f0-4ec6-bfe2-cb0ce40ed33e-0
00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.510
It's a little misty. So now.

99783bde-9d32-4e03-afdd-8e6a8a2d3727-0
00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:03.630
We see a scene where it looks
like there are, there are.

e0e712fe-db89-4183-baa5-ae9a1e8df70b-0
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.030
There are men, I'm not sure what
they're doing. 

bb32341d-9382-4fb2-a1fc-a2ffe079a28c-0
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.380
They got long sticks. There's an
another.

98a31993-cba4-4ace-9d35-c32cea196c8f-0
00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.200
Person with a big hat.

a79b44e9-ad72-41af-a637-d0ffe19d977b-0
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:20.140
Giving food to some creatures
who are hungry.

0735ad3d-372e-4d5b-ad2e-d4487b1a4f04-0
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.250
There are women in a in a shop,
and they're buying something.

425c6c58-01f1-4bd4-84fa-1198f84f2a67-0
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:28.780
There's

55f567bb-a168-461d-b891-e7ffedf10cf1-0
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.150
A man painting.

c2f1f4dd-9687-41e5-889a-e1950faed549-0
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:37.800
Something standing on a ladder.
There's a woman selling.

0b13cfce-4dae-4735-a124-5461b31b5d43-0
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.390
I don't know, food. And.

320b3670-8d2d-42c5-bc65-88a6215c1c26-0
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:44.110
But anyway, the.

2f73ce1d-1345-4fda-a366-4cedb66c3ca1-0
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.149
The man comes to the door, looks
like of a restaurant, and he's

2f73ce1d-1345-4fda-a366-4cedb66c3ca1-1
00:49:51.149 --> 00:49:52.940
talking to the man.

b82134b7-f60d-4485-9860-22bf7ba3effa-0
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:58.368
The chef in the restaurant, then
he goes somewhere else. He's

b82134b7-f60d-4485-9860-22bf7ba3effa-1
00:49:58.368 --> 00:49:59.580
talking to a man.

bfbdcfea-9180-4d71-b4bb-ff44b1855d07-0
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.872
Sitting by a big boiler and he's
asking him something so it looks

bfbdcfea-9180-4d71-b4bb-ff44b1855d07-1
00:50:05.872 --> 00:50:09.894
like he's looking, he's trying
to get directions, or he's lost

bfbdcfea-9180-4d71-b4bb-ff44b1855d07-2
00:50:09.894 --> 00:50:13.852
something or he's looking for
something. He he's in, he's now

bfbdcfea-9180-4d71-b4bb-ff44b1855d07-3
00:50:13.852 --> 00:50:16.149
in a shop, he's talking to a
woman.

c53c3ba5-005c-48e0-af2e-ee697cc78f2a-0
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.940
And he's.

a888415a-4045-472e-9637-212327afd1d4-0
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.220
He's in a.

a02dc03b-de40-45bf-84d7-a1fcf2a82a5f-0
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:29.112
He's in a place where there are
lots of these floating boats and

a02dc03b-de40-45bf-84d7-a1fcf2a82a5f-1
00:50:29.112 --> 00:50:34.520
he's asking a workman or so
somebody with a with a tall hat,

a02dc03b-de40-45bf-84d7-a1fcf2a82a5f-2
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:39.751
the same thing. So he's he's
trying to find something that

a02dc03b-de40-45bf-84d7-a1fcf2a82a5f-3
00:50:39.751 --> 00:50:44.804
he's he's lost or trying to find
directions. He's asking

a02dc03b-de40-45bf-84d7-a1fcf2a82a5f-4
00:50:44.804 --> 00:50:50.124
something of all these people
and he's not getting answers.

a02dc03b-de40-45bf-84d7-a1fcf2a82a5f-5
00:50:50.124 --> 00:50:51.719
So. #END_arrival_5

c889dca6-4a0c-4158-a4d9-c2f914d5c2c6-0
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.340
All right. So that was this part
of the story.

8bbcc967-a94e-4d95-8344-1a7d897cb152-0
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:02.762
Alright, so this next one is a
complex scene, so like you were

8bbcc967-a94e-4d95-8344-1a7d897cb152-1
00:51:02.762 --> 00:51:06.671
doing before, describe what you
see and what is happening and

8bbcc967-a94e-4d95-8344-1a7d897cb152-2
00:51:06.671 --> 00:51:10.140
I'll let you know when it's off.
It's about 5 minutes.

ba19c78c-4efc-49c9-9fcb-acb32bd03f28-0
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:11.470
OK.

8e0d13eb-76f1-4a2c-8502-c953b780e7d5-0
00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:14.340
It's.

bb1140d2-e171-4b6e-aa22-50894d8623e7-0
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.634
#START_birthday_party_fun OK,
this one says birthday party

bb1140d2-e171-4b6e-aa22-50894d8623e7-1
00:51:21.634 --> 00:51:25.621
fun. {The Penguins stumble upon
a birthday celebration. Amelia

bb1140d2-e171-4b6e-aa22-50894d8623e7-2
00:51:25.621 --> 00:51:29.356
thinks the monkeys at the zoo
seemed calm in comparison to

bb1140d2-e171-4b6e-aa22-50894d8623e7-3
00:51:29.356 --> 00:51:33.280
their kids at this party. You go
ahead straight for the party

bb1140d2-e171-4b6e-aa22-50894d8623e7-4
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.267

So we see a birthday party,
there's a a bouncy castle, and

Not looking to be a great deal
of traffic at the table. There

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:19.115
More kids on paddle boats.
There's a couple of kids in

e3488a43-5ab6-4f10-811b-e5729f0a93f0-1
00:59:19.115 --> 00:59:19.550
kayaks.

281d86ff-384b-473b-98ae-afe03828554e-0
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:31.774
Then around the side of the the
lake there are people riding

281d86ff-384b-473b-98ae-afe03828554e-1
00:59:31.774 --> 00:59:33.490
bikes. They're

3aa1ef0c-773e-4889-b51d-6bee938ae78f-0
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:42.660
Just hanging out on the on the
rocks, there's a a cabin with.

41352a3f-d731-4f11-8fd4-395d61f4ccb7-0
00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:45.710
Umm.

32bec60d-938b-4732-b0e5-607936d303d8-0
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:51.915
There's a boat stacked outside
the cabin. Down the path, there

32bec60d-938b-4732-b0e5-607936d303d8-1
00:59:51.915 --> 00:59:57.171

stands and backflips of various

00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:59.340
kinds of somebody doing a.

a03a0400-9006-4b66-af84-1f66ee3700a6-0
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.710
Standing on one leg. Maybe it's
a yoga pose.

378bab6e-a7d4-4687-b2a6-cc0e68e3e63d-0
01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:11.865
People chatting and talking. One
girl has this long noodle like

378bab6e-a7d4-4687-b2a6-cc0e68e3e63d-1
01:00:11.865 --> 01:00:16.849
floatation thing. There's a
dock, people are sitting on the

378bab6e-a7d4-4687-b2a6-cc0e68e3e63d-2
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:21.832
dock. One goes fishing off the
edge of the dock. Penguin is

378bab6e-a7d4-4687-b2a6-cc0e68e3e63d-3
01:00:21.832 --> 01:00:24.739
actually fishing off the dock,
so.

600943ec-d156-424a-b660-98dc8aa6b914-0
01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:34.674
There are, near the shore, there
are people lying on on rubber

600943ec-d156-424a-b660-98dc8aa6b914-1
01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:35.720
rings and.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.770
And.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.260
The.

Mattresses, air mattresses, and

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:51.186
On the on the shore there's a
beach is there are kids making

dc7b777a-3720-4a65-8b92-fc12bf56dbe8-1
01:00:51.186 --> 01:00:52.020
sandcastles.

0dc408c0-6dd8-4a1d-bd95-8df00e60c68f-0
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.860
Somebody's riding a Segway
scooter over the.

7dc7446c-83c1-4128-a215-b71021fb2b96-0
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:06.501
over the sand. There are little
kids in a in a more isolated

7dc7446c-83c1-4128-a215-b71021fb2b96-1
01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:07.020
pool.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.050
seems to be like a good time.

c9c4f192-71c4-40b0-a1f2-53118f375147-0
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:17.296
There are, further up the beach,
there are people sitting in and

c9c4f192-71c4-40b0-a1f2-53118f375147-1
01:01:17.296 --> 01:01:21.603
deck chairs under umbrellas.
It's a waste basket that the

c9c4f192-71c4-40b0-a1f2-53118f375147-2
01:01:21.603 --> 01:01:23.460
Penguin is hiding behind.

105dba90-9491-479c-b29a-7db6602797f2-0
01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:28.840
Somebody's playing soccer.

f5fc5e63-2471-419e-b7e8-2660dfee4862-0
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:34.580
That's a.

31a2ae2a-853d-4179-a0dc-9e206d05a40c-0
01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.040
Man giving a kid a piggyback
ride. Somebody has a kite.

89a342a2-f8fc-44a1-a992-2c1a09f3b970-0
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.450
There are.

093e4676-0c97-4775-a46d-0a9b2796fd40-0
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:46.700
Uh.

7f1e4a9f-e4e9-4b3c-85cd-b4507ec1bfb8-0
01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.008
Ohh so these. There there are
some people playing bocce, it

7f1e4a9f-e4e9-4b3c-85cd-b4507ec1bfb8-1
01:01:54.008 --> 01:01:58.811
looks like, tossing balls trying
to get next to a small white

7f1e4a9f-e4e9-4b3c-85cd-b4507ec1bfb8-2
01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:03.692
one. There's a boat on the shore
and there's a volleyball game

7f1e4a9f-e4e9-4b3c-85cd-b4507ec1bfb8-3
01:02:03.692 --> 01:02:08.186
going on. Somebody just is
trying to spike the ball and a

7f1e4a9f-e4e9-4b3c-85cd-b4507ec1bfb8-4
01:02:08.186 --> 01:02:12.370
girl is is has her hands up
trying to block the shot.

fa4f2970-f326-442c-9336-1c40beb39836-0
01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.750
There are some.

6e0a7c76-5645-4cf4-9218-2b76b563b3e8-0
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.808
Older people looking out calmly
at the, at the scene, there's a

6e0a7c76-5645-4cf4-9218-2b76b563b3e8-1
01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:30.347
couple, there's a teenager
couple going to go walking hand

6e0a7c76-5645-4cf4-9218-2b76b563b3e8-2
01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:34.290
in hand along the beach.
#END_by_the_lake

3fc3c23a-1fdf-42c7-abc8-ca2ef64e81cf-0
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.701
What else have we not? We're
good team. We can move on to the

3fc3c23a-1fdf-42c7-abc8-ca2ef64e81cf-1
01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:43.370
next one.

6bb112c6-931f-49cc-9069-ad030722c1c7-0
01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:44.990
OK.

a57afb1b-b5d6-485a-a2a4-b35f3972695d-0
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.140
Again, it is a complex scene.

9d725df2-71f7-4713-8227-2ba4e5a8f024-0
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.610
Alright.

0b9f9e19-8308-4d7e-ab26-eb8876d8cb9e-0
01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:01.781
#START_unfriendly_giants Now
this one is called the

0b9f9e19-8308-4d7e-ab26-eb8876d8cb9e-1
01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:05.896
unfriendly giants. {Then Waldo
and Wizard White Bread came to

0b9f9e19-8308-4d7e-ab26-eb8876d8cb9e-2
01:03:05.896 --> 01:03:09.679
the land of the unfriendly
giants, where many waldos had

0b9f9e19-8308-4d7e-ab26-eb8876d8cb9e-3
01:03:09.679 --> 01:03:13.463
been before. And Waldo saw that
the Giants were horridly

0b9f9e19-8308-4d7e-ab26-eb8876d8cb9e-4
01:03:13.463 --> 01:03:17.777
harassing the little people. And
when he found the 10 scroll, it

0b9f9e19-8308-4d7e-ab26-eb8876d8cb9e-5
01:03:17.777 --> 01:03:21.759
was time to continue with his
journey. That's the caption.}

eb97b9fd-894b-48dc-8f90-dbf135e67bed-0
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:31.430
So we see giants and little
people mixed up.

bde3b9c5-369d-4adc-a10b-18b806333f09-0
01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.190
There are

d1bbece0-05cb-4b78-92dc-baa8482d24c8-0
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:40.541
Uh, some giants in the in the
bottom left here who are sucking

d1bbece0-05cb-4b78-92dc-baa8482d24c8-1
01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:45.659
water through straws out of a
pond, and they're squirting the

d1bbece0-05cb-4b78-92dc-baa8482d24c8-2
01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:49.210
water at little people, which
knocks them.

ee136e81-f621-4841-b8c7-f80fdf60428f-0
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:57.058
Over and they're they're unhappy
about it, but they can't do much

ee136e81-f621-4841-b8c7-f80fdf60428f-1
01:03:57.058 --> 01:03:58.020
about it.

df1aec25-ed20-4c55-83b4-2d1fe8533b39-0
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:02.400
There are.

21ee3f2b-4e0c-45ca-a434-952f9e7909e6-0
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.547
Moving to the left, there are
people, there are little people

21ee3f2b-4e0c-45ca-a434-952f9e7909e6-1
01:04:09.547 --> 01:04:11.180
who are fighting back by.

a249f4b3-978e-490a-940d-158d1c58f55f-0
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.070
Catapulting rocks at the Giants.

4f337c9b-a7ac-4f0f-8ba4-c2261d430c92-0
01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.964
But the the the rocks seem to
just bounce off the Giants

4f337c9b-a7ac-4f0f-8ba4-c2261d430c92-1
01:04:24.964 --> 01:04:30.269
without doing much harm. And
then one of the rocks bounced

4f337c9b-a7ac-4f0f-8ba4-c2261d430c92-2
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:35.844
off and hit some of the little
people, which did do them some

4f337c9b-a7ac-4f0f-8ba4-c2261d430c92-3
01:04:35.844 --> 01:04:39.890
harm. And the there's also a
giant smacking.

e2a73434-a189-43b3-ba16-ed62811ed459-0
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.890
A bunch of little people.

0a4dd028-00de-4ac2-b0f1-dff3020c2e13-0
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.480
There are.

a62fab1e-847e-4cff-af95-19f9d8633b44-0
01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.644
Giants who are playing a game of
of chess or drafts, or I think

a62fab1e-847e-4cff-af95-19f9d8633b44-1
01:04:52.644 --> 01:04:57.090
it's drafts because they're
hopping over multiple people.

a34032d0-500a-4cc6-85a7-dcd6a8d548ce-0
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:04.100
They, uh with with little people
and and.

93eb1c42-a7f3-4f8a-b767-e4afa2e0a81b-0
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.485
The little people just have to
stay there and be part of the

93eb1c42-a7f3-4f8a-b767-e4afa2e0a81b-1
01:05:08.485 --> 01:05:10.190
part of the part of the game.

8119fdfb-d3bc-4be1-9b6a-ded10a70b694-0
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:19.263
And one of the Giants who's
watching the game just gives a a

8119fdfb-d3bc-4be1-9b6a-ded10a70b694-1
01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:24.180
backhanded slap to little people
and knocks them over.

9cdcd84e-9bfd-4f1f-a1dd-b8a4a63adf80-0
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.260
Moving around we see a house
where seems to be a house for

9cdcd84e-9bfd-4f1f-a1dd-b8a4a63adf80-1
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:40.720
little people, and they are they
are wandering around and.

a9a939de-10de-43bb-9f08-77e95ee84b56-0
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:46.740
Finding their own businesses, it
seems like they aren't being

a9a939de-10de-43bb-9f08-77e95ee84b56-1
01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.640
harassed by the Giants exactly
there.

57999fe3-cfbb-41e2-8aa8-c03b065851d3-0
01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:01.887
Moving up on the left, we see a
trap for a for a giant. There's

57999fe3-cfbb-41e2-8aa8-c03b065851d3-1
01:06:01.887 --> 01:06:05.840
a picture of a giant woman.

f1c0e073-53eb-472a-9fa0-e0e2e14fa65b-0
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:13.226
Uh, which is attracting a a
giant man. But there's a a big

f1c0e073-53eb-472a-9fa0-e0e2e14fa65b-1
01:06:13.226 --> 01:06:19.895
hammer behind the woman which
the little people are operating

f1c0e073-53eb-472a-9fa0-e0e2e14fa65b-2
01:06:19.895 --> 01:06:26.995
and the hammer is going to smash
the man as he approaches the the

f1c0e073-53eb-472a-9fa0-e0e2e14fa65b-3
01:06:26.995 --> 01:06:30.330
woman to make friends with her.

9b9d9050-5bfa-487b-9abe-8979c32514b7-0
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.810
Looking to the right, we see.

fcbb2c0f-0e95-4f83-9c65-74a780543ce1-0
01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.510
Some little people trying to.

ee6027dd-2f37-4637-84a2-db1632ad50df-0
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:45.727
Trip a giant who has who has
caught some little people and

ee6027dd-2f37-4637-84a2-db1632ad50df-1
01:06:45.727 --> 01:06:51.337
has stacked his belt but he,
they've got a, a a a rope around

ee6027dd-2f37-4637-84a2-db1632ad50df-2
01:06:51.337 --> 01:06:53.780
one of the giants feet but.

338e5ce5-39c4-4146-ac9d-a1f6382e5fbc-0
01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.187
It may be that the giant is is
just pulling them and they're

338e5ce5-39c4-4146-ac9d-a1f6382e5fbc-1
01:07:00.187 --> 01:07:05.958
not having a lot of effect with
this rope. Another giant has a

338e5ce5-39c4-4146-ac9d-a1f6382e5fbc-2
01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:10.630
rope of his own and he's looped
it around a house.

c091631c-1173-4090-ac9d-d6d767d92fb1-0
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:18.598

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:28.676
Moving further on, there's a a
giant approaching another of

a0e086f1-13d5-46db-aa58-6fa826fe089a-1
01:07:28.676 --> 01:07:29.780

01:07:35.987 --> 01:07:41.258
looks like a bunch of flowers
but it's actually a tree that

35c54f52-9a24-4eed-9c05-b7cfe34a6ed0-2
01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:42.840

Last minutes we can go on to the

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:00.190
OK.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.000
Right, alright.

01:08:13.116 --> 01:08:17.276
very strange things happened at
the airport this morning. A

e27683c3-63fb-40b0-9345-bdb60473ddd8-2
01:08:17.276 --> 01:08:21.782
helicopter chopped down all the
flagpoles, a smuggler was caught

e27683c3-63fb-40b0-9345-bdb60473ddd8-3
01:08:21.782 --> 01:08:25.803
hiding, walks is under his
beard, and a herd of elephants

e27683c3-63fb-40b0-9345-bdb60473ddd8-4
01:08:25.803 --> 01:08:28.230
was heading onto a jumbo jet
with.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.720
This is being sent to wallow
folks under the carpet under the

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.760

see an airport scene out on the.

6436eba3-9a89-401c-a806-93e01c3870c3-0
01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:47.797
Tarmac, there's a a plane a
people are getting off the

6436eba3-9a89-401c-a806-93e01c3870c3-1

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.609
People offloading the luggage,
they they don't seem to be doing

4ff7235d-d065-463a-8702-e31bb7e100b7-1
01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:59.975
a very good job. They're
throwing the bags around and

4ff7235d-d065-463a-8702-e31bb7e100b7-2
01:08:59.975 --> 01:09:01.970
bumping and hitting one another.

449e016c-e146-430e-b024-c2af7a6bf961-0
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:03.600

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:08.286
Getting many of the bags on the
trolley that's waiting for the

01:09:08.286 --> 01:09:11.910

bags on the on the trolley.

01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:20.259
There are there are people
standing on the on the wings and

3a29ce71-7643-439f-aa47-a1e63e74f4b3-1
01:09:20.259 --> 01:09:23.110
on the top of the plane for
some.

69b9bb9e-172d-4459-996d-0069e1c187c2-0
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:32.110
Reason there's a fire engine
which is trying to.

26ce7f09-3b00-4bfb-b47f-c1f26ba61b63-0
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.490

Reason.

c325fbe4-8dd6-4243-9272-3afdcc82110f-0
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.569
There are a bunch of of workers
who are standing around some

c325fbe4-8dd6-4243-9272-3afdcc82110f-1
01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:54.222
crates looks like they're
smoking, even though that's a

c325fbe4-8dd6-4243-9272-3afdcc82110f-2
01:09:54.222 --> 01:09:56.300
bad idea around jet fuel.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.570
There there are.

dfd0de17-e701-4cfa-9be6-fb236c12cbea-0
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:05.300
There's another plane with.

3ec8923f-bd49-4afa-ac5e-2cc3cea7a723-0
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:10.958
Passengers trying to get out of
the stairs for the to the plane

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:14.709
have been pulled away, so
they're actually all falling out

3ec8923f-bd49-4afa-ac5e-2cc3cea7a723-2
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:17.380
of the plane and falling onto
the ground.

52c8f9e7-6e8b-4e8d-9132-e3d54c631b6f-0
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:26.227
There's a a small a small plane
of an old fashioned biplane with

52c8f9e7-6e8b-4e8d-9132-e3d54c631b6f-1
01:10:26.227 --> 01:10:29.540
a playing card in its cockpit.

925a11da-535e-4b57-99ec-8fabe169d244-0
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:36.593
The playing card is is an ace of
spades. And that's probably

925a11da-535e-4b57-99ec-8fabe169d244-1
01:10:36.593 --> 01:10:41.072
because pilots are kind of
pilots are called aces

925a11da-535e-4b57-99ec-8fabe169d244-2
01:10:41.072 --> 01:10:43.669
sometimes. There's there's a.

ca5a0ead-4d70-43a3-ae1a-ebcc08962510-0

A jumbo jet.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:52.156
Which has just opened the door
and its nose, and the opening of

9a26aa3a-c341-48c3-a16b-d25f15325162-1
01:10:52.156 --> 01:10:56.523
the door is just knocked a bunch
of workers off the top of the

9a26aa3a-c341-48c3-a16b-d25f15325162-2
01:10:56.523 --> 01:10:59.990
truck that they were standing on
behind the door.

01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.260
There are.

01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:09.423
A couple of other planes, one
plane is is trying to go

755dd388-1dfa-4563-b0c1-9eead26ea667-1
01:11:09.423 --> 01:11:10.160
somewhere.

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.044
Ohh and and in fact there's a
plane with blue stripes and the

adfd76ea-6617-431e-92d2-60b0b862c9aa-1
01:11:16.044 --> 01:11:19.967
plane with a yellow body. And
there are guys with the

adfd76ea-6617-431e-92d2-60b0b862c9aa-2
01:11:19.967 --> 01:11:24.253
directional panels where they're
trying to guide them, but

adfd76ea-6617-431e-92d2-60b0b862c9aa-3
01:11:24.253 --> 01:11:28.685

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:33.117
other and they're guiding the
planes towards each other, and

adfd76ea-6617-431e-92d2-60b0b862c9aa-5
01:11:33.117 --> 01:11:37.694
in a way that is not good for
probably going to bump into each

adfd76ea-6617-431e-92d2-60b0b862c9aa-6
01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:38.130

There's a plane taking off.

There's a looks like a Concord
or Concorde plane. There's a a

01:12:02.776 --> 01:12:07.578
dirigible, a biplane or a
regular jet. There's a rocket

01:14:03.552 --> 01:14:08.664
into the crowd and attacking and
eating people there. There are

01:14:08.664 --> 01:14:13.535
some gladiators who who are
trying to escape from a lion and

1f3c724c-aea6-4e90-b38d-1452b6db2918-4
01:14:13.535 --> 01:14:16.890
and they're climbing up the
walls of the.

a22319d8-cd12-4ed2-8c36-c6259f7589c7-0
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:19.820
Of the arena.

e7b82353-3a06-46e7-b19f-91b976739396-0
01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:29.466
There are, there are lions
coming out of of a of a gate

e7b82353-3a06-46e7-b19f-91b976739396-1
01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.010
and.

280a16d4-dc09-4e1d-895d-8ed374be4eb9-0
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.000
They're looking around, maybe
for their next meal. There.

598bb875-bc89-48ce-bdfc-6738116b55e7-0
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:43.590

A chariot with four horses and a
man being dragged behind it

744f7f21-25e7-47ed-a908-5bc85457b6b8-1
01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:54.150
looks like he fell out of the
actual chariot.

09834c81-e714-4697-9dd1-d42fb22c3412-0
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:57.180
There's.

22c52bad-a66b-4ff8-8bf4-ea25e6882a15-0
01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.978
Ahead of him, there's a man
who's just holding onto the

22c52bad-a66b-4ff8-8bf4-ea25e6882a15-1
01:15:02.978 --> 01:15:07.657
reins of horses, being dragged
by them. Further back, there's,

22c52bad-a66b-4ff8-8bf4-ea25e6882a15-2
01:15:07.657 --> 01:15:08.400
there's a.

c5c80600-e7ab-4b55-8f7b-f890e7d47ff4-0

A chariot where the roles have
been reversed and there are

c5c80600-e7ab-4b55-8f7b-f890e7d47ff4-1
01:15:13.512 --> 01:15:13.870
four.

b8b3ae97-de97-4e54-b31d-7c2396ea10b0-0
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:20.368
Men who are gladiators may be
who are pulling Chariots in

b8b3ae97-de97-4e54-b31d-7c2396ea10b0-1
01:15:20.368 --> 01:15:23.860
which there's a horse holding
the reins.

942a9d1f-1943-48e5-8cf5-23bc4bedd390-0
01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:32.891
And then then behind them is a
regular looking chariot, that is

942a9d1f-1943-48e5-8cf5-23bc4bedd390-1
01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:34.690
with a man and.

4ec8ea4a-fb24-464d-a745-fad8e31da5d0-0
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:44.069
Driving horses. The the chariot
has these big spiky things on

4ec8ea4a-fb24-464d-a745-fad8e31da5d0-1
01:15:44.069 --> 01:15:44.560
the.

06b65ed3-5f83-40a0-8e2f-896c158344d3-0
01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.010
On its axles.

d0927e6c-d790-411b-b88f-c6e20184bc34-0
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:52.280
And it looks like it's just
driven over one man.

f0886d3e-67a9-45fd-9597-f5878115522d-0
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:59.309
There, there's there's various
fights going on here. There are

f0886d3e-67a9-45fd-9597-f5878115522d-1

there are gladiators with
swords.

Umm.

0263c6cc-7017-4454-92f7-a1de71658948-0
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:14.218
Gladiator is lying on the ground
and he's lost his shield and

0263c6cc-7017-4454-92f7-a1de71658948-1
01:16:14.218 --> 01:16:15.230
another one.

799666a4-b328-4382-93e7-fd51c40d283f-0
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:20.719
He's probably one of the the
Christians because he doesn't

799666a4-b328-4382-93e7-fd51c40d283f-1
01:16:20.719 --> 01:16:23.840
have any armour, but he's got a
sword and he's about to.

1305321b-56e3-403f-93f2-37c3c66fd021-0
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:26.220
slay the gladiator.

fefc79a4-0d09-49c0-aa9c-1561fdbc18b1-0
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.590
Then

ca29883c-6184-44b3-add6-c67a2425824e-0
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:32.550
There are.

29c7dacd-fb5b-4874-b2ef-b06208719a40-0
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:41.750
There are people who are wounded
who are being helped away.

d1c5e0ff-4572-410a-8eb5-10c3717d73ac-0
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.310
There, there are people who are
being dragged away.

e0c73f4b-6eae-457b-8f43-f3f9dd4f23df-0
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.741
There there's oh, I see
something with a with a Trident

e0c73f4b-6eae-457b-8f43-f3f9dd4f23df-1
01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:59.993
and a net, which is I think was
used to be used for fighting

e0c73f4b-6eae-457b-8f43-f3f9dd4f23df-2
01:16:59.993 --> 01:17:02.060
lions. Oh and there are.

9c328538-c66f-4936-b01a-f9c7d665b52e-0
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:08.256
Not sure whether tigers or
leopards. I think there might be

9c328538-c66f-4936-b01a-f9c7d665b52e-1
01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:13.002
leopards with big yellow cats
with with spots that are also

9c328538-c66f-4936-b01a-f9c7d665b52e-2
01:17:13.002 --> 01:17:13.240
in.

c11aca74-cbaa-45c3-91be-44a4025956a2-0
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.270
And fighting. #END_ancient_rome

b37afe14-ada3-4e67-b192-2b39d645b756-0
01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:21.480
OK, we can go on. That was about
5 minutes.

f75ed0c5-7dfc-415f-9c5c-a91dec6e271d-0
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:29.070
OK, OK, so um, we are moving
into a story. It has 11 pages.

a7d20ce1-160c-452a-b18f-6892961bae4e-0
01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:36.080
Hey.

9a3b2318-b1f9-44ac-97bc-b1e1da3b47b4-0
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:42.918
#START_flowerman So we see a
scene with a with a a village.

9a3b2318-b1f9-44ac-97bc-b1e1da3b47b4-1
01:17:42.918 --> 01:17:46.130
There's a gas station and bar,
bait shop.

35dbcd51-25ee-475f-8dcf-88652bb5f7f1-0
01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:48.810
It looks like there's a.

f4effefa-c5e0-4680-b75c-9d7696b5d683-0
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:51.520
It used to be.

6550ea8d-aa24-479f-b643-3b063c33b829-0
01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:55.020
A seaside place.

7aeab7ce-7a5b-4d55-8ef4-d636cc7a7665-0
01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:02.010
Uh, with a with a harbour and a
little dock, there are some.

5ab680a0-312a-4090-a853-c55ff3e9ba96-0
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.410
There's a boat, but there's no
water.

12332318-4a2e-4aaf-a162-7c0ad7b5dd60-0
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:09.020
And the water is all dried up.

4b721378-e993-476f-948b-c3a5541a7312-0
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:15.894
There's also in the background.
It looks like a a funfair with a

4b721378-e993-476f-948b-c3a5541a7312-1
01:18:15.894 --> 01:18:18.140
with a with a Ferris wheel.

2ecb1192-e0a9-4961-837e-bf5c394cdb23-0
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:25.007
Behind the behind the gas
station. There is a a bridge

2ecb1192-e0a9-4961-837e-bf5c394cdb23-1
01:18:25.007 --> 01:18:31.061
over this old harbour and a man
is walking across the bridge

2ecb1192-e0a9-4961-837e-bf5c394cdb23-2
01:18:31.061 --> 01:18:35.130
which is illuminated by these
gas lamps.

a920ad6f-09b6-474c-9576-8c00d1688e28-0
01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:44.181
So the man continues along into
the into the town. He's

a920ad6f-09b6-474c-9576-8c00d1688e28-1
01:18:44.181 --> 01:18:44.850
carrying.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:50.170
A bag in one hand and an
umbrella in the other.

5e17d921-804b-48ff-9630-1923824f0f5b-0
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:57.965
Again the the street is
illuminated by these old gas

5e17d921-804b-48ff-9630-1923824f0f5b-1
01:18:57.965 --> 01:19:00.550
lamps. There is a cafe.

533c76b2-c8ec-4911-b391-1ed5ac6ac701-0
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:03.150
Somebody leaning against the.

b89b73a0-8ec4-4696-8868-bfcf6a8de3cd-0
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:09.040
Door or door post in the cafe,
there are people.

2248c51e-2fe4-4999-bbb4-c8caff63f5d3-0
01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.150
In the.

444ea351-ce81-47c7-b692-2801efbc4357-0
01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:15.040
Apartments above the cafe.

8af78914-2b5f-49b6-990b-7032eb0369cc-0
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:16.240
Uh.

608a6abe-05cb-4d09-86fe-6b8aa6827bec-0
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:20.403
A man and a woman, not sure what
they're doing, seems to be

608a6abe-05cb-4d09-86fe-6b8aa6827bec-1
01:19:20.403 --> 01:19:21.410
looking at each other.

5105172e-95fd-4c71-b2f3-120c81ed363c-0
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.910
I I see a car on the street.

2b0130a5-3103-4bd4-a465-832879c8bfa5-0
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:33.449
Which is illuminated from the
street partially with this

2b0130a5-3103-4bd4-a465-832879c8bfa5-1
01:19:33.449 --> 01:19:35.940
headlamp. And there's a there's
a boy.

1017d065-55a2-4488-ad7e-9ebecd731fe4-0
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:38.650
On a balcony.

78e149ee-b2dd-4554-bff1-2d27ed25dcf2-0
01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.622
Looking out, away from the
direction that man is coming

78e149ee-b2dd-4554-bff1-2d27ed25dcf2-1
01:19:44.622 --> 01:19:45.630
from with a.

349a1eed-291c-47dc-be89-a5404d583ec1-0
01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.190
Probably a dog sitting on the on
the.

f8c9b339-5f32-4784-9a5d-b67891c4a02a-0
01:19:53.670 --> 01:19:55.700
About on the edge of the
balcony.

3f6d13a5-bbae-470f-852f-100b1d1811b3-0
01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.910
Accompanying the boy.

7c259774-55a2-4963-a0cd-7f338c51b23e-0
01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:12.870
Now the the the man gets further
and he is approaching a house

7c259774-55a2-4963-a0cd-7f338c51b23e-1
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.420
with a for sale sign.

457d7c56-3aaf-4b21-8969-6d7caf0a531e-0
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:20.250
on it. That house looks empty,
but next to it there's a.

38fdbc53-3ef5-4c5d-ac29-df0a1c3ae054-0
01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:21.860


bd8a81f9-1f3c-475a-a1e0-5a354ef2a16b-0
01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:25.320
A better.

f5734fe0-4c17-421a-981d-2cfaed4d0170-0
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:28.700
More populated.

5635b9be-ed37-4d68-a227-4dac1e5042db-0
01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.528
house. Yeah, the one with the
for sale sign looks like

5635b9be-ed37-4d68-a227-4dac1e5042db-1
01:20:34.528 --> 01:20:37.591
decrepit. The shutters are
falling off the windows, but

5635b9be-ed37-4d68-a227-4dac1e5042db-2
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:38.740
next to it there's a.

b9535c70-25de-4b88-abd5-734801441cec-0
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:42.160
it's a house. There's a, is a.

51fb8a38-a7c7-4d6c-8365-1be3dc66bcc5-0
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:44.740
A man.

c9810c16-4483-483c-a5b0-3fdd412620e7-0
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.580
It looks like he's in the bath.

eaea82d2-e983-4b17-983b-37d39f49fb3b-0
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:50.910
And.

737c1cd1-cbc0-4510-92c3-c30f248b195f-0
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.890
The.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:01.090
And then it looks more like a
living room in the next room.

7c55e577-31f5-41c7-ac67-b39f4af39647-0
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:03.700
with, with a couple of people in
it.

640a32d5-e770-47c2-8858-e4a384049b70-0
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:10.035
Uh, and then there's, uh, there
are more houses with more people

640a32d5-e770-47c2-8858-e4a384049b70-1
01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:11.240
coming and going.

846875ff-a789-48ce-add0-7613ae27340c-0
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.930
There's a.

b3bd9ef7-13d4-46f2-9dd9-896a652d2e2a-0
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:17.950
A fountain in the street, again
without any water in it.

10d462c3-fba4-410a-b1fd-f2cdd49ae8de-0
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:21.110
And it's.

4f57fbfd-80bd-4adf-83db-53f1fc4019f3-0
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:29.244
The man is the only one that has
any color showing. His hat is

4f57fbfd-80bd-4adf-83db-53f1fc4019f3-1
01:21:29.244 --> 01:21:34.100
blue and his clothes, um bag is
tan and he wears a scarf.

3502dc8a-25bb-49ab-8730-f5940a4715d6-0
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.740
So now it's daylight and the
man, the four self sign is gone

3502dc8a-25bb-49ab-8730-f5940a4715d6-1
01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:50.025
and the man is fixing up the
house, he's repairing the

3502dc8a-25bb-49ab-8730-f5940a4715d6-2
01:21:50.025 --> 01:21:55.310
shutter, he's got a lawnmower
out, he's cut the grass.

9d1bbc78-4eba-4140-9480-3bfa4cb6fc63-0
01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.070
The tree behind the house is is
is blooming.

06ea68b7-9e67-4d19-89e9-fdf2ed30e25b-0
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:06.680
The house next door, the man is
still in the in the bath and.

89829918-2f20-4a12-997d-dd17836bcb44-0
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:14.774
The the people in the room next
door are still there. There's a

89829918-2f20-4a12-997d-dd17836bcb44-1
01:22:14.774 --> 01:22:16.400
milkman delivering.

c5bc22fa-9d57-4091-ab4e-7e9c99db1c95-0
01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:20.063
Milk and people are in the
streets and they're, they're

c5bc22fa-9d57-4091-ab4e-7e9c99db1c95-1
01:22:20.063 --> 01:22:23.232
going places. They're probably,
some of them are going to work.

c5bc22fa-9d57-4091-ab4e-7e9c99db1c95-2
01:22:23.232 --> 01:22:24.520
Some of them are going to.

dc8174fe-3b82-4a03-8787-48c2bd099fb6-0
01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.070
the shop.

f729c410-c0a8-4a9a-a104-5b872a3600e3-0
01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:27.590


0a6b0681-9baf-4b14-9c5a-a45afeff9aae-0
01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:32.900
And.

b7988ad8-3c45-4024-9be0-cc4ae6a380be-0
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:37.890
Now we see the.

7faf216e-ec74-4eb6-a566-c1671b9866da-0
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:39.260
the

5c57e659-4e9f-4fb5-90ec-92e7969db633-0
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:47.735
The man has pretty much fixed up
this this house. It's it's

5c57e659-4e9f-4fb5-90ec-92e7969db633-1
01:22:47.735 --> 01:22:52.910
remarkably colorful compared to
everything else.

df980e4a-715c-4987-b398-484045e8ca59-0
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:57.080
It's it's things are things are
much.

f4ff1ce5-f506-4887-b508-bdbfdf6877f1-0
01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.490
Brighter.

3cc914f4-f8d8-4c50-853f-2bbeec089d5e-0
01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.095
But everything else is is all
black and white, while the house

3cc914f4-f8d8-4c50-853f-2bbeec089d5e-1
01:23:06.095 --> 01:23:09.190
has a, has a purple roof, blue
shutters.

0aa67ecd-394c-40c1-96be-01e2b9d53e96-0
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.950
Are a red, orange, green tree.

50ff7e40-b952-4a3b-8392-7f4e6e1ba728-0
01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:16.420
Behind it.

9d07e498-7dee-4268-9299-050c5d0cefd4-0
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.730
Umm.

1ed3c56a-f589-408e-b651-ddad6000da55-0
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:23.557
There are. There are other. You
know, other people are going

1ed3c56a-f589-408e-b651-ddad6000da55-1
01:23:23.557 --> 01:23:26.530
about their business. Oh but
there is one girl.

33446891-3962-4dc9-950c-66747edb27c8-0
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:32.148
Walking along the sidewalk, but
also has some color to her. So

33446891-3962-4dc9-950c-66747edb27c8-1
01:23:32.148 --> 01:23:36.180
she's probably going to be part
of the story, and she is.

8cd194fb-cdd1-49a4-bb1b-21718c0243e3-0
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.670
Carrying something, I can't make
out what it is.

0fd805b9-1c9a-4238-a8d1-48f937fed38e-0
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:43.200
And.

df66490c-82c9-4884-9e06-c798c0dcb6ef-0
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:49.390
The, the man, The original man
is down on his knees.

0cf8cb6e-0b11-4edf-9f99-0fe705bd173b-0
01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.710
He's he's.

5f4a9863-28d5-4adc-810a-5d42fc1c1842-0
01:23:54.070 --> 01:24:01.030
Hand is raised, waving. And the
the girl is has her head down.

675776cd-f203-4d9f-b827-c38da2e9f307-0
01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.675
Walking away. So maybe the man
and the girl have had some kind

675776cd-f203-4d9f-b827-c38da2e9f307-1
01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:06.910
of.

96a5495e-e310-497f-9587-9be133e2ec3f-0
01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:11.500
Falling out. She looks sad. He
looks a little sad too.

c2d489a8-c9d9-47ee-8901-ac5463679257-0
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:21.330


57791cb9-fa5c-4e40-bc34-432f6c202200-0
01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:26.190
So now there's a lot more color
in in this picture.

a00dba66-c104-48f9-9e2e-a5ab8fd0e9c6-0
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:35.290
The man is in front of the of
his house.

6320398d-a039-4001-97ee-1bc3472df57c-0
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:44.180
With another woman with orange
hair, green jacket, blue skirt.

45cde66c-e03f-4f29-9feb-f93385a0a029-0
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:54.175
Standing next to him is A is A,
is a boy. He'd been in previous

45cde66c-e03f-4f29-9feb-f93385a0a029-1
01:24:54.175 --> 01:24:59.817
part of the pictures, but now
he's in, he's in color. There's

45cde66c-e03f-4f29-9feb-f93385a0a029-2
01:24:59.817 --> 01:25:00.000
a.

5b273cac-6da9-47bd-8449-7b7d35a11c28-0
01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.762
Girl in the street. So, so
somehow seems that this man's

5b273cac-6da9-47bd-8449-7b7d35a11c28-1
01:25:06.762 --> 01:25:12.085
color and I don't know,
livening, is is somehow livening

5b273cac-6da9-47bd-8449-7b7d35a11c28-2
01:25:12.085 --> 01:25:18.061
up the neighborhood. But we see
the girl who would walk away in

5b273cac-6da9-47bd-8449-7b7d35a11c28-3
01:25:18.061 --> 01:25:21.889
sadness across the street
holding on to.

420c1765-871f-42a8-b785-adc110026af8-0
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:27.360
Uh, a man. Again she seems sad.

dd4f54fc-4d1f-485d-baeb-2cc213a26801-0
01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:34.075
It's not really clear what she's
sad about. But that house is is

dd4f54fc-4d1f-485d-baeb-2cc213a26801-1
01:25:34.075 --> 01:25:38.894
now much more colourful than it
was before. Although the man

dd4f54fc-4d1f-485d-baeb-2cc213a26801-2
01:25:38.894 --> 01:25:41.660
she's holding on to is is is
grey.

253f497b-1125-4ceb-9d5a-64a548698ec5-0
01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:43.760
Umm.

98721d8e-c431-4a7b-838b-4a1ffc42b91b-0
01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.998
There are other details. There
are other bits of color over to

98721d8e-c431-4a7b-838b-4a1ffc42b91b-1
01:25:49.998 --> 01:25:54.248
the right and in fact the man in
the in the bath is is now in

98721d8e-c431-4a7b-838b-4a1ffc42b91b-2
01:25:54.248 --> 01:25:58.292
colour, although the the next
room, the people in the next

98721d8e-c431-4a7b-838b-4a1ffc42b91b-3
01:25:58.292 --> 01:26:02.816
room. So it's still unclear what
they're doing but they are still

98721d8e-c431-4a7b-838b-4a1ffc42b91b-4
01:26:02.816 --> 01:26:04.530
black and white. There's.

395c8aa5-7874-44c1-bca2-33ac472eff6d-0
01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:08.400
A moving van called Movers and
shakers.

fb26e127-f52c-4478-80c3-577eb8940652-0
01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:15.604
And the people, gray people in
in that house with the man in

fb26e127-f52c-4478-80c3-577eb8940652-1
01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:19.130
the bathroom, appear to be
moving out.

11ac0540-2c58-4e46-b989-6c4a43e60f8a-0
01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:21.560
So maybe the

278f40e6-e9d4-4972-af49-01fef04c6102-0
01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:25.380
Gray people are moving out of
the neighborhood, and they're

278f40e6-e9d4-4972-af49-01fef04c6102-1
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.470
all being replaced by more
colorful people.

81741b1d-963b-4d18-b0bb-be79c1f572b0-0
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.200
So now.

b0697f62-e3d9-491d-84d9-8788ee8a2b76-0
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.330
Umm.

ebbd3aa9-930e-473e-a365-c95663e8be9e-0
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.600
Things are really colourful all
over the town.

3870f8d0-9488-4da5-b3c3-7e038daf8089-0
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:45.640
Um, the man

3593bafc-db54-4445-b568-c0fb1ffee657-0
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.530
he's he's got an apron on.

8f1a7183-c3ae-431d-922e-c82e99697368-0
01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.007
He's uh. There's a woman
standing next to him with her,

8f1a7183-c3ae-431d-922e-c82e99697368-1
01:26:57.007 --> 01:27:01.953
with a baby. It's a small child
looking through the through the

8f1a7183-c3ae-431d-922e-c82e99697368-2
01:27:01.953 --> 01:27:02.340
door.

d62f90bc-7719-48f7-be33-8c9aa93ae1bd-0
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.760
Umm.

963ad05f-b389-4c30-bae5-f70903e9c803-0
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.170
Let's see. I'm trying to see if
we can see the.

d11acee1-ddb2-4ee7-ab23-b082ff23485c-0
01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:15.290
The sad.

1d623e54-5f3f-4333-ba76-d0449b726749-0
01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.770
girl. She may be.

9f1c96c3-81fc-46d7-a9a5-ea1a5ece61d3-0
01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.970
Standing, sitting in front of
the.

7b410020-12f4-4ed7-bb83-a1808dea8941-0
01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:29.627
Of the house with the man in the
back. He's still in the bath,

7b410020-12f4-4ed7-bb83-a1808dea8941-1
01:27:29.627 --> 01:27:33.470
but the room next to him is now
in in bright colour.

4f572ffd-7a31-4195-8917-b84a9f7a1e76-0
01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.860
There are people on the balcony
on the roof of that house.

1f0913e2-d521-4390-b0df-66762fdcec5d-0
01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.690
A man, a woman and a child.

65a25e97-2aff-4208-aa46-4717ce57a462-0
01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:50.328
There's an older man sitting on
the steps of of of that house

65a25e97-2aff-4208-aa46-4717ce57a462-1
01:27:50.328 --> 01:27:56.040
and the the girl who maybe the
girl who was sad is is.

348b85fb-8bf1-48bb-8112-142b5f09dab5-0
01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.595
Sitting or kneeling in front of
him and maybe he's telling her a

348b85fb-8bf1-48bb-8112-142b5f09dab5-1
01:28:01.595 --> 01:28:02.010
story.

f3fb095c-8ec5-4aba-b33f-a6535916c5f0-0
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:09.551
There's a there's a car, a
bright colored sports car in the

f3fb095c-8ec5-4aba-b33f-a6535916c5f0-1
01:28:09.551 --> 01:28:10.840
in the street.

3cc768d8-31c5-4a91-8a19-a7a5cc8d4cd0-0
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:16.220
And there's a milk truck also in
the street.

24301824-016c-4979-8d37-c2002d66b2a3-0
01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.490
Kids playing soccer.

3c4ed560-eae6-4b34-a4b9-d5bd51fd49b9-0
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:22.340

With a with a bad leg.

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:30.627
And the milkman is dancing in
the street with another girl, so

d2da8d93-1081-4ef1-a1ba-03289ab50798-1
01:28:30.627 --> 01:28:34.340
I think things look a lot
happier in this town now.

0e0f9e33-8e3f-4bed-9c37-f50418b21798-0
01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:45.190
{OK.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.430
Ohh this I'm sorry, the same
thing.

5bdb1ee6-25ff-4867-88da-e75d2159d42c-0
01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.910
So the the.}

01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:02.260
Where is the man?

aeb820f5-00a7-4a43-8a39-d1ee0a1d3567-0
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:10.204
So now the man is leaving, he's
his, his house is is closed up.

aeb820f5-00a7-4a43-8a39-d1ee0a1d3567-1
01:29:10.204 --> 01:29:16.109
It still looks in in good shape,
but there's also a I think it's

aeb820f5-00a7-4a43-8a39-d1ee0a1d3567-2
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:21.741
a for sale sign on the grass,
which is which is now not quite

aeb820f5-00a7-4a43-8a39-d1ee0a1d3567-3
01:29:21.741 --> 01:29:22.650
so neatly.

Trimmed.

01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:28.846
The man has finally got out of
the bath and he's standing on

3a710b2e-eb52-41a3-a0cc-bb5f3f406b3f-1
01:29:28.846 --> 01:29:31.440
the roof of his house with a
towel wrapped around him.

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:35.120
But he looks happy.

The guy in the wheelchair is is
going down the street. The kids

208f27e0-7cb9-4bab-8977-77383cfb8877-1
01:29:47.404 --> 01:29:49.360

There's a kid on a hobby horse.

01:29:55.570 --> 01:30:00.187
I'm not sure whether it's the
same girl who was sad. The, you

d8cb2e63-cf1d-4131-bddb-b9b0766415d1-1
01:30:00.187 --> 01:30:04.730

01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:10.150
Happy next to a an older, larger
girl.

01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:26.212
There's still people on the on a
rooftop with a telescope that

cbcd4b67-d029-435d-80e5-c18696aed319-1
01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:28.690

on it.

01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.720
The milk truck is still there.
There's nobody, nobody in it.

47dcd537-7ed9-4398-a1a4-b9ab6daaddbe-0
01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.060

Looks like an ice cream.

01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:50.200

flowers in it.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.090
What else?

da3e6a3e-2bca-48b2-8751-ab63ccb2a515-0
01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:06.020
OK.

bf88241d-af35-4e5c-85ca-859385e6a9ef-0
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:14.120
So now the man is going back the
way he came.

23fa684a-eb1b-47d3-9f38-6ff3649ed6c7-0
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.880

As in the second picture, we saw
that the the balcony.

a7cd7c5a-3a96-4153-bbf1-a09eeeefcc43-0
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:31.530

girl.

3315291a-cd1a-4ff1-b904-82600aec3dae-0
01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:37.740
On it, the one where there was
just one boy previously.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.660
The cafe

01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:47.890

01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:49.640
The door.

418deda9-fb7c-416b-8de4-ca08e46ccd00-0
01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.936
There's a man with a, standing
next to a motorbike. The light's

418deda9-fb7c-416b-8de4-ca08e46ccd00-1
01:31:55.936 --> 01:31:56.110
on.

e8e352af-89e1-45f1-bed2-fd4672787c9b-0
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:01.680
The man

fb26baf8-9f25-4572-9dd8-dd757f9ec4e5-0
01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:07.904
Is taking off down the street.
It's it's it's starting to get

fb26baf8-9f25-4572-9dd8-dd757f9ec4e5-1
01:32:07.904 --> 01:32:11.448
dark. I think it's not
completely dark, but it's

fb26baf8-9f25-4572-9dd8-dd757f9ec4e5-2
01:32:11.448 --> 01:32:16.077
getting dark. But there's still
a lot of, a lot of colour in in

fb26baf8-9f25-4572-9dd8-dd757f9ec4e5-3
01:32:16.077 --> 01:32:17.090
in the houses.

e2047cf1-c0be-4686-91d3-81395d93f7e6-0
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:24.460
But now the light is almost
faded.

fde5792e-3b2c-4f6a-998f-1555d0889b81-0
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:26.760
And the man

bac2eccd-00b6-4c79-a66e-4eb6252561df-0
01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:34.129
Is in a different place. It's
it's it's dark. He's under a

bac2eccd-00b6-4c79-a66e-4eb6252561df-1
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:37.910
street lamp. It's it's bright
and and he's.

eab3ce99-f271-4e10-9946-e702cb5ceb98-0
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:43.821
Outside the house with a for
sale sign on it. There's a

eab3ce99-f271-4e10-9946-e702cb5ceb98-1
01:32:43.821 --> 01:32:44.660
little dog.

And the man is holding.

01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:57.600
I'm not sure he's holding. It's
it's a diamond shape.

840a2872-b7c6-49f4-8f04-076a45fba117-0
01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:06.000
But he's he's still colorful,
and all the houses around are

840a2872-b7c6-49f4-8f04-076a45fba117-1
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.886
are Gray and colorless. There's
a man watching him through a

840a2872-b7c6-49f4-8f04-076a45fba117-2
01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.720
window of the next.

a36eeb7b-cf4e-44b9-bb65-e5c915596cd5-0
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:19.637
uh house looks very surprised.
He's got a a a pipe holding a

a36eeb7b-cf4e-44b9-bb65-e5c915596cd5-1
01:33:19.637 --> 01:33:24.483
pipe that's close to his mouth,
and up above there's a little

a36eeb7b-cf4e-44b9-bb65-e5c915596cd5-2
01:33:24.483 --> 01:33:29.251
girl and a woman looking out.
The little girl looks pleased.

a36eeb7b-cf4e-44b9-bb65-e5c915596cd5-3
01:33:29.251 --> 01:33:31.440
Woman looks kind of shocked.

a026ff05-3695-4660-a73a-51d852f56afe-0

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.617
So now there's, there's, there's
color again, the the girl is

8f9253fc-fda3-4118-b826-b2af1ce96bf7-1
01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:43.290
holding a flower.

01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:50.253
Which the it looks like the man
is probably just given her,

980eff30-a718-40bb-9752-9f8391349548-1
01:33:50.253 --> 01:33:55.356
because he's proceeding out of
the picture to the right and the

980eff30-a718-40bb-9752-9f8391349548-2
01:33:55.356 --> 01:33:57.110

rosy. The house is still Gray.

ccaf513b-1f02-41bf-b076-86bcfcc206bf-0
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:15.280

complex scene.

off on a worldwide hike you can
come to. All you have to do is

56aad2d4-3c5b-47b5-8eda-de687bb0da1e-0
01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:43.660

01:39:57.190 --> 01:40:01.667
got out of. And there's an
awning where the entrance to the

ffd20b6c-2e87-4ca6-a128-43a39ac54515-3
01:40:01.667 --> 01:40:04.280

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.267
And it looks like maybe a a, a
dog that got away that they're

8d0f0d16-2b7a-4d04-a8e7-c4262f9f77f5-1
01:40:14.267 --> 01:40:15.390

01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.980
Looking further away, we see.

b7320492-0e74-4155-846d-7cba9b299f58-0
01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:26.320
Fire Station with Fire engine, a
jail.

fd8f97dd-e574-4ec8-95fe-cc7f61575de0-0
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.560

01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:46.606
We see the, another store, is
maybe a television store, and

d3e8b42c-d6e9-4468-945a-b33d39d1e667-1
01:40:46.606 --> 01:40:48.680

car repair place. #END_waldo_1
