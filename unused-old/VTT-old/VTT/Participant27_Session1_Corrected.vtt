a5cf7d6a-9b2a-44dd-b529-84f6b7f6b30d-0
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.534
So this is our first session in
the norming study. You're going

a5cf7d6a-9b2a-44dd-b529-84f6b7f6b30d-1
00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:12.237
to see two types of pictures.
The first one that you're about

a5cf7d6a-9b2a-44dd-b529-84f6b7f6b30d-2
00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:14.209
to see is a complex scene.

531a54f6-3af9-45b1-aaed-5c86b4408bc0-0
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.320
So as the name suggest it is.

b1e1f93f-8384-49be-87f0-8c633546af11-0
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.278
If I can just move it, OK,
you're going to see a complex

b1e1f93f-8384-49be-87f0-8c633546af11-1
00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:27.387
scene. Imagine you're describing
it to somebody who cannot see

b1e1f93f-8384-49be-87f0-8c633546af11-2
00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:31.301
the picture. Describe what is
happening and what you see as

b1e1f93f-8384-49be-87f0-8c633546af11-3
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:35.281
thoroughly as possible. And
please try to take between three

b1e1f93f-8384-49be-87f0-8c633546af11-4
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.390
and five minutes.

469b3e54-394e-4b92-83cf-ca5887970813-0
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.200
OK, here we go.

709e0277-a9a4-4e60-897f-35a96f1847bd-0
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810
It can start when you're ready.

1239ee3e-c250-462e-81a8-46158de4d689-0
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.430
Ohh gosh.

04e0e618-1f1a-42f5-a856-d181a43120de-0
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.580
So um.

c7e9d0bc-139a-4c94-80a5-ec184a1e70ff-0
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.516
#START_picture_this I see a
whole bunch of tiles which are

c7e9d0bc-139a-4c94-80a5-ec184a1e70ff-1
00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:00.430
laid out.

30675346-e180-4eab-8082-dd5d8700a588-0
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.240
On a surface they are. They are
partially overlapping.

7dcc427c-a66c-4970-896d-cb84338e147e-0
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.560
And.

32b16f92-adac-4682-ae0f-95cb0a152ec3-0
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.110
each tile.

aa93c158-afcd-4c55-8e86-04b53386f4b8-0
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.869
Shows a particular image of a
person or an animal or whatever.

aa93c158-afcd-4c55-8e86-04b53386f4b8-1
00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.070
There is a a white notebook in
the upper left hand corner.

8924ff4e-d521-442c-9f9d-e809f59d51f7-0
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.840
Of the of the scene which says
picture this.

4d19f1e5-8e48-41ad-ad82-169b93ec30ea-0
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.617
It's a little hard to read.
{When I look at all these framed

4d19f1e5-8e48-41ad-ad82-169b93ec30ea-1
00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:54.394
portraits, although they may be
colored differently. Some of

4d19f1e5-8e48-41ad-ad82-169b93ec30ea-2
00:01:54.394 --> 00:02:01.394
these are characters I have met
on my other travels. There are

4d19f1e5-8e48-41ad-ad82-169b93ec30ea-3
00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:01.950
also.

66aa822a-f043-4b35-9ff1-24c587ba6906-0
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.020
Some who appear elsewhere in
this book.

358cfb85-0005-42d5-8c58-d5c372eff4ce-0
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.325
Can you spot your characters
that appear twice in this

358cfb85-0005-42d5-8c58-d5c372eff4ce-1
00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:14.540
spectacular?

4a405b7f-dc0e-40ef-8715-e59234f01000-0
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.170
Display.}

0551a094-8b2e-40af-b47b-398580622e78-0
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.680
OK, so.

fe8ced8e-777a-4637-8b85-d9ab38b29638-0
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.497
I've never seen this display
before, so I can't do the

fe8ced8e-777a-4637-8b85-d9ab38b29638-1
00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:28.040
recognition that they.

00f3717e-3832-421c-bde0-5802d6c7b892-0
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.116
The the note is talking about.
{yeah, don't worry about the the

00f3717e-3832-421c-bde0-5802d6c7b892-1
00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:35.750
the task, you can just.}

47d28c00-0d4c-4812-8418-75d3bd225af6-0
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.310
So um.

e6417be5-6107-42fa-90f2-020e7b981b6f-0
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.630
Starting on the.

7777bf92-0e7a-4819-aeb5-42fd07666975-0
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.660
There, there there are.

a91b8748-f035-4c07-b92d-ea0162bc7e6c-0
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.940
In addition to the all the
tiles, there are two.

44d40005-7e90-4cd5-8e48-75939e6a73b4-0
00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.419
Things which are not tiles. One
is a picture, a person that

44d40005-7e90-4cd5-8e48-75939e6a73b4-1
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:06.039
looks like a caveman at the
bottom left hand corner walking

44d40005-7e90-4cd5-8e48-75939e6a73b4-2
00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:11.846
in a direction away from the
rest of the tiles, and then what

44d40005-7e90-4cd5-8e48-75939e6a73b4-3
00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:17.746
looks like an airplane on the
the middle left hand side flying

44d40005-7e90-4cd5-8e48-75939e6a73b4-4
00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:19.619
away from the tiles.

52d038c9-a5f8-4bd2-9a7d-0a1fb0063522-0
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.310
So the only thing I can do now
is start to describe the tiles

52d038c9-a5f8-4bd2-9a7d-0a1fb0063522-1
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.310
themselves.

5b5997da-6a35-45d1-92cb-3b1fd743261a-0
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.670
And.

81fbb69e-19a3-4d34-a7ed-67b59d1da56f-0
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.610
{Do better. Maybe with my other
glasses. I'm on all the sizes.

7c24e68f-f52d-4c49-814f-71062e84cb17-0
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.250
Complex. It's complex, so.}

53005df3-8df5-4529-88c0-192d218764f0-0
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.410
Let me on the bottom, bottom
right.

b1ff31fd-848f-4827-905d-d02342dac878-0
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540
The first tile, well.

6ddc9be6-90da-4f32-8b86-b2e9897e8fc2-0
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.620
Maybe I should start on the on
the on the top left.

ade6e413-735e-4f2f-867b-ec5fca57d0da-0
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.330
So the top left corner is a
picture of a a dragon.

b21eb114-24aa-4296-af02-7e8cb67c868c-0
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.642
Moving to the right, there's a
picture of a a man with his

b21eb114-24aa-4296-af02-7e8cb67c868c-1
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:20.220
mouth open. Or it could be a.

a707badc-b2c4-4c6d-bf76-2e6ab62b44a2-0
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.500
Like a suit of armor with the
visor open.

c881da36-9307-4c34-af99-6a384a467567-0
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.715
The next one to the right is a
person standing over a body. It

c881da36-9307-4c34-af99-6a384a467567-1
00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:42.271
looks like maybe a pirate who is
just slain somebody. The next

c881da36-9307-4c34-af99-6a384a467567-2
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:48.931
one to the right is a picture of
a person's head and shoulders.

c881da36-9307-4c34-af99-6a384a467567-3
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.700
It's upside down.

026e171b-b434-485f-96ce-5d375744f5d8-0
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.688
The person looks like maybe he
has his his hand or his finger

026e171b-b434-485f-96ce-5d375744f5d8-1
00:04:56.688 --> 00:04:57.780
to his mouth.

2dcfe6ac-f776-4339-9c34-03230f1cd143-0
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.120
Umm.

ac3760a4-4be1-4795-8fc6-db8fbcc2e86e-0
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.030
The next one to the right is.

3d0be76c-b707-4fcb-a528-f31c7117a975-0
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.917
A person with a maybe a crown,
but it's sideways, so the

3d0be76c-b707-4fcb-a528-f31c7117a975-1
00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:15.060
person's face is facing down.

56f26342-a27f-402e-91f9-d5506440c0b6-0
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.110
Going to the right again, there
is a person with a battle axe

56f26342-a27f-402e-91f9-d5506440c0b6-1
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.390
that looks like an old style
soldier holding a a a battle axe

56f26342-a27f-402e-91f9-d5506440c0b6-2
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.910
above his head.

8d04e025-fba4-491e-930d-87e35b5d8b62-0
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.480
The next is a picture of a a
wolf or a dog.

f16ef3cc-ceaa-46a6-8816-8fdb1845e4ce-0
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.410
Just the head and shoulders of
that.

27cd3d4d-ad35-47dc-8ffb-b8373db9934a-0
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.690
Uh.

ed79b3c4-a590-4fd6-b19e-6240ba19b66d-0
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.190
Next we have a picture of a a
person, a man.

c70d4475-8641-437a-91c7-334aab548c15-0
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.157
With looks like a wheelbarrow,
and in the wheelbarrow is

c70d4475-8641-437a-91c7-334aab548c15-1
00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:58.450
another man.

7bc0b5e3-1d25-40e8-9fac-930a17eb2585-0
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.887
Both men are wearing red
baseball caps. The the man

7bc0b5e3-1d25-40e8-9fac-930a17eb2585-1
00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:11.650
pushing the wheelbarrow has a
blue jacket and kind of.

7ba75840-8bf2-457a-b015-e043334a56aa-0
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.982
reddish tannish pants. This
person in the wheelbarrow has a

7ba75840-8bf2-457a-b015-e043334a56aa-1
00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:20.410
yellow shirt and blue pants.

837ef58c-be53-428e-92a6-edaa4da20f50-0
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.802
Next to the right is a person
holding a shield and a sword.

837ef58c-be53-428e-92a6-edaa4da20f50-1
00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:33.650
The shield is in the left hand.
The sword is in the right hand.

371a58de-933d-4b8a-afd0-df2eafd60793-0
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.590
The.

2d91ee3e-85e8-4cbb-8f7a-719d905f3121-0
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.298
The tunic that this person is
wearing is green on the left and

2d91ee3e-85e8-4cbb-8f7a-719d905f3121-1
00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:43.580
red on the right.

a7ca119f-22ca-47d1-9c11-c790d5927cc3-0
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.910
Going to the right again, we
have a picture of.

3a86a33b-5ca4-4555-828d-f8049151b904-0
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.849
Some kind of animal. I'm not
sure whether it's a camel or a a

3a86a33b-5ca4-4555-828d-f8049151b904-1
00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.401
donkey or whatever, but it's it
has a it could be a horse, but

3a86a33b-5ca4-4555-828d-f8049151b904-2
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:04.580
it's funny looking horse.
#END_picture_this

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-0
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.264
OK, that was about 5 minutes. We
can go on to the next one. OK,

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-1
00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:17.044
OK, so unlike a complex scene,
this time you're about to see

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-2
00:07:17.044 --> 00:07:21.902
graphic novels. So there are a
series of pictures that tell a

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-3
00:07:21.902 --> 00:07:26.603
story. Again, imagine you're
telling the story that someone

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-4
00:07:26.603 --> 00:07:31.148
who cannot see them and describe
what you see and what is

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-5
00:07:31.148 --> 00:07:36.084
happening, and we're aiming for
between 10 and 15 minutes. OK,

014395dc-1fe7-42ce-bb36-1e6e4f2f3ae5-6
00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:36.320
OK.

9615d7fa-cdd3-4598-90fd-ddc7c77d5a6a-0
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.670
So this one has around 3 pages.

97633fa8-017c-4efb-bb44-72f03f1e9da5-0
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.712
And just like a book, it goes
from left to right, up top to

97633fa8-017c-4efb-bb44-72f03f1e9da5-1
00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:46.190
bottom.

629b3b3f-3035-4bd3-b3d9-181ec8e6d2b1-0
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.228
Sure. So there are. Are you
saying there are three pages?

629b3b3f-3035-4bd3-b3d9-181ec8e6d2b1-1
00:07:57.228 --> 00:08:00.130
I'm only seeing the first of
them or?

a48100b1-9425-4088-bc06-f217b3e5369d-0
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.860
OK.

afc02d54-c14d-4936-9098-a7adc8b55869-0
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.450
I'm I'm jiggling back and forth
with two pairs of glasses here.

34a3a312-85c1-443e-8699-df1abe5b03a8-0
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.000
I normally use the.

251452dc-53ad-4ec5-b513-d96e586586f2-0
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.982
The the the other ones for
computer but but these. This is

251452dc-53ad-4ec5-b513-d96e586586f2-1
00:08:19.982 --> 00:08:24.906
sufficiently small that I've got
to get close enough and then I'm

251452dc-53ad-4ec5-b513-d96e586586f2-2
00:08:24.906 --> 00:08:27.070
back in my bifocal range, so.

bc811cdb-3348-4614-a482-bd991176ba37-0
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.916
Alright, so, um, should I should
I start? I'm, I'm sorry, I

bc811cdb-3348-4614-a482-bd991176ba37-1
00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:39.025
haven't actually started yet.
OK, you start when you're ready.

bc811cdb-3348-4614-a482-bd991176ba37-2
00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:41.540
#START_arrival_2 OK, so we see.

32c957ec-329a-4501-9cc2-f03338f5e79b-0
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.180
Two women.

8903246e-0007-4985-869c-aa29fed0155e-0
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.270
Sitting.

b4b614f7-fc9d-4560-a481-cca79458e88d-0
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.671
I'm not quite sure. They have
suitcases so they're travelling

b4b614f7-fc9d-4560-a481-cca79458e88d-1
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:55.290
somewhere.

8bb6f41c-8c65-4610-97cc-22d2af421ced-0
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.556
Can't quite make out what's the
left of them. Is it a a person

8bb6f41c-8c65-4610-97cc-22d2af421ced-1
00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:03.200
in a bed?

df09ef5c-673f-47d7-80c7-cd3cd5e850a1-0
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:12.898
Or is it a child? So anyway that
these two women are going on a

df09ef5c-673f-47d7-80c7-cd3cd5e850a1-1
00:09:12.898 --> 00:09:18.129
journey, they they look to be
not, they're not wealthy. They

df09ef5c-673f-47d7-80c7-cd3cd5e850a1-2
00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:22.760
they look poor. Like one of the
huddled masses maybe.

5259e645-b38f-4a26-9759-eb3eb6ae3f5e-0
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:31.020
They're they're also, uh, the
next picture has um, 2, two men.

0af7b7ba-600d-46ef-ab6d-ecd1fab4c301-0
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.210
Maybe three men, two with flat
caps. Uh, they also have luggage

0af7b7ba-600d-46ef-ab6d-ecd1fab4c301-1
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.360
there. They're travelling.

9120dcb1-dc45-4b01-8cf2-f6c89e6b638d-0
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.770
Probably not well, so they may
be immigrants.

15e15cd9-a7bb-476c-9c71-6856a2a16381-0
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.810
The the third is a woman with a
baby, so it's the same.

aa82d280-52a0-4c76-9483-b985778e1f58-0
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.340
Same journey story, so.

4008bbbe-a894-431e-9aab-578efdbffdac-0
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.410
We we then see a man.

d7fe3502-7f96-4292-8ceb-26057ff3d0d7-0
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.160
In a, writing In a book.

aa7f6378-0d55-461a-be6c-b85e79249ff7-0
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.720
Perhaps a journal.

ef02d2cf-7f53-4355-a284-d3159a53c34a-0
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.560


a4b398ff-7f81-4766-a7b3-762dedbf6902-0
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:22.225
And and then he tears a page out
of the book and he starts to do

a4b398ff-7f81-4766-a7b3-762dedbf6902-1
00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:29.500
origami with with the page that
he's torn out, and he makes a.

cec7d626-b8f5-49d8-9835-31b92db46f8b-0
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.772
A crane. I guess it would be a
crane. He holds up that crane.

cec7d626-b8f5-49d8-9835-31b92db46f8b-1
00:10:36.772 --> 00:10:42.638
He's looking at it. I think he's
fairly pleased with his work,

cec7d626-b8f5-49d8-9835-31b92db46f8b-2
00:10:42.638 --> 00:10:45.990
but he looks around for a place
to.

9ae738f0-6455-4afe-8b61-1d803b1ba5e0-0
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.540
Place this crane.

ee0a1dcd-75cb-4c4c-a397-48cc087f16f0-0
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:51.830
Um.

fc21f6db-a091-40dc-9936-03767f36a290-0
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.820
And he's.

7ba65602-0437-49d0-8f1a-3b7cb2cdd5a8-0
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.892
Looking around and and and he, I
guess he goes out on deck on the

7ba65602-0437-49d0-8f1a-3b7cb2cdd5a8-1
00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:09.020
ship that he's on and he he's
sees things in the sky and.

84a67fd6-50b0-4f92-b24f-873194a20ca7-0
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.600
All of a sudden there are these.

2d91b03e-a1be-49da-a3f5-f0d7953cc36f-0
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.210
Um.

687972d6-dd1c-41f7-9bcd-f371fbf97673-0
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:22.035
Birds or what they look like
birds. But they're actually not

687972d6-dd1c-41f7-9bcd-f371fbf97673-1
00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:23.900
birds. They're they're.

3a38a963-3b5c-480f-b5d0-3c8f4e0d1c58-0
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:30.695
They're origami like things that
are floating around, so it's

3a38a963-3b5c-480f-b5d0-3c8f4e0d1c58-1
00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:36.718
unclear how so many of them got
there or what their relation is

3a38a963-3b5c-480f-b5d0-3c8f4e0d1c58-2
00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:38.130
to the man who.

2b46bf5a-2ee8-454f-a63f-6065ad3ac75d-0
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.170
Um, who made the crane.

8cc321d7-a0ce-4eb8-b729-d4c8ca55ae87-0
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.730
I'm I'm trying to make sure that
it's the same man who made the

8cc321d7-a0ce-4eb8-b729-d4c8ca55ae87-1
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.325
crane who is looking around, but
because the background is

8cc321d7-a0ce-4eb8-b729-d4c8ca55ae87-2
00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:58.580
different, but I think it's
because.

ee841775-281d-4d1b-8b4d-b1043265f898-0
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.062
In the right hand page, he's
supposed to be outside, whereas

ee841775-281d-4d1b-8b4d-b1043265f898-1
00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:07.930
he was inside when he was making
the crane inside the ship.

d00363aa-437f-4a17-bdb3-23feafe65c13-0
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.110
So.

71af97f7-99c2-4b91-8f03-a171be39bb97-0
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:18.020
The man is, uh when he's looking
at these.

76f18a28-59d1-41db-8436-da7736f94f63-0
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.369
These origami cranes which are
flow which are flying all around

76f18a28-59d1-41db-8436-da7736f94f63-1
00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:29.325
the boat is. Also there are lots
of other people on the boat who

76f18a28-59d1-41db-8436-da7736f94f63-2
00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:33.900
are seeing the same thing and
they are all amazed I'm sure.

e821a236-8346-4aa9-bf6e-0df90fe6ea9c-0
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:44.310
So now the boat arrives in New
York City. You can see the

e821a236-8346-4aa9-bf6e-0df90fe6ea9c-1
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:50.186
Empire State Building there,
though we don't see the Statue

e821a236-8346-4aa9-bf6e-0df90fe6ea9c-2
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:56.257
of Liberty, which is the iconic
thing. But anyway, the people

e821a236-8346-4aa9-bf6e-0df90fe6ea9c-3
00:12:56.257 --> 00:12:59.000
are all on deck on the boat.

8f6e6636-70f2-4e0d-89e1-084542741712-0
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.090
Looking and.

8efc31fe-695b-4fba-8ba8-5beb1f434ea4-0
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:20.070
The in addition to the typical
New York skyline we see.

30a44a17-d6ba-4d4b-a572-0752b3b09b44-0
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:24.090
2 remarkable vessels.

55d953fe-4cc9-453f-b5ef-6cd8ba92895a-0
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.870
Which hold giant figures.

7c87eede-5c30-4a67-8415-67faeced9384-0
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.710
Um.

a3aa8e51-cdf5-44de-927b-9e09c0ab1e8d-0
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.320
They look.

ee686f5d-1987-4563-8e84-ed0011e08b9c-0
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:43.770
Chinese or other uh, East Asian
in, in character.

41949f44-7605-4473-8a5e-ff4ba08f06c3-0
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.850
One is holding.

d5d8edb5-1a70-4873-9c3f-7db91326eb47-0
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.870
Some kind of animal. The one on
the left is holding an animal.

b2764b48-1005-4808-ab4d-65419d19571a-0
00:13:54.590 --> 00:14:00.680
Uh. And he has a, uh, a hat.

6558f74d-135e-4c29-9e68-a40223ac749d-0
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.870
Uh, it kind of a.

041b7244-ff7a-4213-808b-b340299369cf-0
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:13.627
A cylindrical hat and he's
looking at the other figure, and

041b7244-ff7a-4213-808b-b340299369cf-1
00:14:13.627 --> 00:14:19.904
holding on to the other figure's
hands. It's like a handshake.

041b7244-ff7a-4213-808b-b340299369cf-2
00:14:19.904 --> 00:14:24.786
The other figure has a
triangular hat and on his

041b7244-ff7a-4213-808b-b340299369cf-3
00:14:24.786 --> 00:14:30.863
shoulder is a bird. The his
other hand that is the the right

041b7244-ff7a-4213-808b-b340299369cf-4
00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:37.040
hand figure's hand. Right hand
figure's right hand is holding

041b7244-ff7a-4213-808b-b340299369cf-5
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.240
a.

bb76ef12-e45c-4df2-9750-0714448ded89-0
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.750
A piece of fruit I think is an
apple.

ba753278-62eb-4c4a-b5ac-40479a032f7d-0
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:49.552
And the the each of the figures
is standing in a different boat.

ba753278-62eb-4c4a-b5ac-40479a032f7d-1
00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:55.815
The boats contain a strange
mixture of of things. On the

ba753278-62eb-4c4a-b5ac-40479a032f7d-2
00:14:55.815 --> 00:15:00.870
right there's a teapot and an
ice bucket and.

394a4a6c-52bb-4eb7-8806-98426199bdae-0
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.321
Maybe a metronome? I'm not sure.
On the left hand one there's a

394a4a6c-52bb-4eb7-8806-98426199bdae-1
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:07.680
suitcase and a teacup.

faea642a-68fe-4e3e-b39a-ecbf8de32483-0
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.010
And a.

3d6b1184-1324-4a09-9160-292dae358f86-0
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:18.807
A flask of some kind and a bowl
with perhaps some fruit in it.

3d6b1184-1324-4a09-9160-292dae358f86-1
00:15:18.807 --> 00:15:19.810
Not clear.

bb90cf84-43af-4a45-a32c-24c6dced5697-0
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.180
Umm.

b8ce7ff9-3782-44b6-a9cf-ec0c88470eb8-0
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.402
But anyway, these these two
figures are intently looking at

b8ce7ff9-3782-44b6-a9cf-ec0c88470eb8-1
00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:31.174
each other. They seem to be
making a friendly gesture and

b8ce7ff9-3782-44b6-a9cf-ec0c88470eb8-2
00:15:31.174 --> 00:15:32.800
perhaps exchanging gifts.

bfed1888-cac8-4791-9ab1-08b6610dc6ba-0
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:40.546
There's also another small boat
which is approaching the the

bfed1888-cac8-4791-9ab1-08b6610dc6ba-1
00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:44.160
boat in which all these people
came.

071e0dad-8692-4659-bb23-adedf1d36cf7-0
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.640
And in the background is, is, is
New York City, yeah.

6570e99c-3fa6-4840-b7ed-4cde72d6a87c-0
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.854
And now the the scene shifts to
a view from the shore where we

6570e99c-3fa6-4840-b7ed-4cde72d6a87c-1
00:16:02.854 --> 00:16:08.967
see the the large ship in which
these people have been traveling

6570e99c-3fa6-4840-b7ed-4cde72d6a87c-2
00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:14.798
with people lining the rail. The
the view is is from beneath,

6570e99c-3fa6-4840-b7ed-4cde72d6a87c-3
00:16:14.798 --> 00:16:20.723
which gives a sense of the size
of this this ship. It's really

6570e99c-3fa6-4840-b7ed-4cde72d6a87c-4
00:16:20.723 --> 00:16:21.099
big.

8472a8d4-2108-4308-98d6-e54cad21a291-0
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.090
And um.

bf4b2dbc-df30-4226-a03d-c602156f7011-0
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:31.082
This the sky is quite dramatic.
It's very heavy clouds, but some

bf4b2dbc-df30-4226-a03d-c602156f7011-1
00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:35.859
light breaking through the
clouds and contributing to the

bf4b2dbc-df30-4226-a03d-c602156f7011-2
00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:41.130
drama is on the left you see a
chimney with smoke belching from

bf4b2dbc-df30-4226-a03d-c602156f7011-3
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.530
it and the smoke.

c694192d-f8c8-44b3-bdb8-fb55d032e8ba-0
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.482
YThe smoke almost blends into
the into the clouds. ou see

c694192d-f8c8-44b3-bdb8-fb55d032e8ba-1
00:16:49.482 --> 00:16:54.924
birds. Ohh. In fact they're not
birds at all, but they're these

c694192d-f8c8-44b3-bdb8-fb55d032e8ba-2
00:16:54.924 --> 00:16:56.200
origami things.

2a5dc8f6-4d25-4df3-9106-7a90f0346a25-0
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.730
flying around the ship.

e4c1f869-6fc0-4d6c-855e-714ea7a3e0ad-0
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:07.653
And in the left foreground
there's a, a, a buoy. I think

e4c1f869-6fc0-4d6c-855e-714ea7a3e0ad-1
00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:15.270
it's a buoy with a with a a
circle star on on the top.

f13718cf-e38e-48cf-a42b-e65ad86449bd-0
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.690
There were also.

7e530d8a-cb89-433e-ab61-0718d5d71514-0
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.070
Another smaller boat.

ec49fe76-0709-47c9-a038-fa863db08dba-0
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.090
Unclear what the relationship of
that is to the big boat, but it

ec49fe76-0709-47c9-a038-fa863db08dba-1
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.080
it appears that this large boat
is approaching the dock.

a7226eb5-4384-4908-90b7-86a6bb31f5fb-0
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.020
And then we see people.

43d2fdeb-6bc4-45b0-897e-965b3733607c-0
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.380
Probably disembarking from the
from the boat. There's a.

2e2fab83-e234-4b41-bded-c7013466a2a4-0
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.222
There's a person with a
megaphone directing them where

2e2fab83-e234-4b41-bded-c7013466a2a4-1
00:17:46.222 --> 00:17:47.430
to go, although.

7547cc80-6e0f-470a-800b-b385d025458e-0
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.395
You'd think the person would be
official, but he looks more like

7547cc80-6e0f-470a-800b-b385d025458e-1
00:17:52.395 --> 00:17:56.040
a I don't know, somebody from a
circus. Not very official.

23993029-6919-4df6-8c6c-bb1d48fe1038-0
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:06.127
Uh, you see a hands with with
boxes. There, there are probably

23993029-6919-4df6-8c6c-bb1d48fe1038-1
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:12.591
people who are going to unload
things from the from the, from

23993029-6919-4df6-8c6c-bb1d48fe1038-2
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:13.530
the ship.

e9159f52-27de-4a49-9675-504a56b30396-0
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.640
And then, uh, we we see somebody
carrying a suitcase.

4f540084-3111-4645-995b-3a2f571e9ecd-0
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.070
We see a.

cd2bdab4-d12a-4c7d-8bba-54b564ef74fe-0
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:28.817
A family, a man with beard, a
woman and some, some children

cd2bdab4-d12a-4c7d-8bba-54b564ef74fe-1
00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:33.742
with their with their luggage.
They're all getting off the

cd2bdab4-d12a-4c7d-8bba-54b564ef74fe-2
00:18:33.742 --> 00:18:39.251
ship. And then a larger crowd of
people and a big queue of people

cd2bdab4-d12a-4c7d-8bba-54b564ef74fe-3
00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:43.758
who've just got off the ship.
You see the ship in the

cd2bdab4-d12a-4c7d-8bba-54b564ef74fe-4
00:18:43.758 --> 00:18:48.766
background, people with their
suitcases and they're waiting

cd2bdab4-d12a-4c7d-8bba-54b564ef74fe-5
00:18:48.766 --> 00:18:49.100
for.

e1967cbe-12fa-4c8e-a006-f191ae1763b9-0
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.425
Processing of of some kind, or
they're waiting to be admitted

e1967cbe-12fa-4c8e-a006-f191ae1763b9-1
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.530
to the United States.
#END_arrival_2

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.580
So that was just part of this
story.

9bce4fee-2ea7-446f-85a2-3612936e4807-0
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.523
To moving on, this is another
graphic novel. It has about 20

9bce4fee-2ea7-446f-85a2-3612936e4807-1
00:19:07.523 --> 00:19:08.110
pages.

832da25c-7e04-4f47-906c-a32bd081db81-0
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.404
Just gotta take a little drink
of water, horse from all the

832da25c-7e04-4f47-906c-a32bd081db81-1
00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:13.880
talking.

0cf71c9e-b9c5-4785-9911-de3ef122bbc4-0
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.160
OK. All right.

384ff19f-d140-46ad-9046-fa9ef169979a-0
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.320
Right. So you want me to start?

7eef31c6-35cc-40bc-bbff-17471fd45de4-0
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.390
Are you ready?

cceb5842-15fb-40b0-9117-5e7702bbd7e3-0
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.210
Uh.

7f50fc14-f4e2-471e-a5b5-91e197c21535-0
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:51.838
Tricky this. Yeah it is. And if
you see any words you don't have

7f50fc14-f4e2-471e-a5b5-91e197c21535-1
00:19:51.838 --> 00:19:58.127
to read them. #START_quest OK
alright so we we see pages of of

7f50fc14-f4e2-471e-a5b5-91e197c21535-2
00:19:58.127 --> 00:20:02.520
a book. There, the scene is a is
in a park.

3892638e-8bf7-44a1-9b73-80e1d0a2afe1-0
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.464
The uh there is a bridge in the
in the park, two children are

3892638e-8bf7-44a1-9b73-80e1d0a2afe1-1
00:20:09.464 --> 00:20:13.370
sheltering from the rain uh
under the bridge.

ff53ac16-4172-48c2-a24f-5d8f0740fbea-0
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.855
They came on a bicycle. It
almost looked like it's a a

ff53ac16-4172-48c2-a24f-5d8f0740fbea-1
00:20:19.855 --> 00:20:24.930
bicycle with two seats so that
they they both came on.

40560c3c-d255-4f59-93bf-630bbcc18d31-0
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.364
I think it's a boy and a girl.
The boy has a horizontally

40560c3c-d255-4f59-93bf-630bbcc18d31-1
00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:35.951
striped shirt there. The girl
has a white shirt and they're

40560c3c-d255-4f59-93bf-630bbcc18d31-2
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:37.480
both wearing shorts.

3e037e91-b0c6-4dad-bffa-3f9f55a43689-0
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.918
The the bridge is surrounded by
elaborate carvings. There's a

3e037e91-b0c6-4dad-bffa-3f9f55a43689-1
00:20:46.918 --> 00:20:52.170
picture of one of a like an
Angel with wings.

505f8bd7-82b5-4dd5-be43-f9be30354319-0
00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:01.729
And uh, standing on a on a rock
in a proclaiming kind of pose.

505f8bd7-82b5-4dd5-be43-f9be30354319-1
00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:09.680
On the other side of the bridge,
we see a figure. It looks like a

505f8bd7-82b5-4dd5-be43-f9be30354319-2
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:16.546
oriental kind of figure with
hands outstretched. Maybe a

505f8bd7-82b5-4dd5-be43-f9be30354319-3
00:21:16.546 --> 00:21:17.389
almost.

58d19993-c72b-4b97-82d9-62f214dfb1e3-0
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.870
Indian maybe?

979cc2ae-e70b-4a76-ac60-8b84069db98b-0
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:28.149
This is a very different kind of
figure from the one on the on

979cc2ae-e70b-4a76-ac60-8b84069db98b-1
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:31.110
the left hand side of the
picture.

6ce79d7a-59fd-4113-ac9c-89c588fe3a4a-0
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.723
And on the right hand side of
the picture we see what looks to

6ce79d7a-59fd-4113-ac9c-89c588fe3a4a-1
00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:45.196
be a a mermaid with a with a, a
person with a outstretched hand.

6ce79d7a-59fd-4113-ac9c-89c588fe3a4a-2
00:21:45.196 --> 00:21:49.080
But the lower part is is a fishy
tail.

b53307c7-df4e-405a-a60f-d820535c46ef-0
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:57.546
Inside, under the bridge, there
is a door that seems presumably

b53307c7-df4e-405a-a60f-d820535c46ef-1
00:21:57.546 --> 00:22:03.226
leads into a chamber. And
there's a there's a light. So.

b53307c7-df4e-405a-a60f-d820535c46ef-2
00:22:03.226 --> 00:22:07.610
So these kids are sheltering
from the rain.

f96669bd-1d3b-4a6e-ad34-f511e04afc8b-0
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:16.390
In this mysterious bridge with a
mix of cultures, the door itself

f96669bd-1d3b-4a6e-ad34-f511e04afc8b-1
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.030
looks.

f335f303-5b77-4b6d-95c2-763954bb3cb4-0
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.850
Like a Middle Eastern Arab, kind
of.

1e96969e-fc51-43fd-8d3a-7227c0f9f1f7-0
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.462
Door. So I think we're we're
drawn to wonder what's behind

1e96969e-fc51-43fd-8d3a-7227c0f9f1f7-1
00:22:28.462 --> 00:22:31.890
that door. And I bet we're gonna
find out.

ddb386fa-6676-41f4-a50f-dfa873540683-0
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.310
So.

11c0f173-0976-43f0-970a-b3b37552d34e-0
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.760
The door opens.

72343300-2ad3-4ec4-8d9e-8d040033efb6-0
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.110
And a figure comes out. It
looks.

95f38de6-b18a-4576-83ad-3ebde38d762c-0
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.650
An old man with a a long white
beard.

9a280df2-172d-4745-be9e-2428cba007e7-0
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.390
And A and a an orange.

436d432e-9f3d-490e-920c-d721d6c94665-0
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.460
Robe.

77ea21b3-4f88-425e-908c-95e2fcc1f731-0
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.260
He's got a.

9505e45c-7b25-475b-88f6-f5524b90f112-0
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:06.310
A crown. It's almost like a
biblical figure or.

cba413cc-5da4-41fe-adfb-d28a04729836-0
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:13.970
Good King Wenceslas or somebody
like that.

87720a18-ef76-408b-a257-a7baffaee12f-0
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.290
Above the door we see more
detail. Now there's a uh.

243e5d76-e282-49da-8094-27dfb2266bf3-0
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:26.945
Picture of a of a of a boat
going over looks like a an

243e5d76-e282-49da-8094-27dfb2266bf3-1
00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:32.721
aqueduct with it's it's almost
Egyptian looking the way the

243e5d76-e282-49da-8094-27dfb2266bf3-2
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:38.690
figures are arranged and and we
see this mermaid again in a a

243e5d76-e282-49da-8094-27dfb2266bf3-3
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.830
fuller figure that that are over
the door.

43deb0af-636b-4c2f-9433-da97642f3755-0
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:50.026
The children are very surprised
by this appearance of the of the

43deb0af-636b-4c2f-9433-da97642f3755-1
00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:54.960
man through the door and he's
holding a piece of paper.

8c288bb6-37ba-4b93-9f90-8f8f097bdfde-0
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:56.970
Which

d1f621fb-b9f3-4d1b-b4e7-d96025ec5b05-0
00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.170
Shows.

649a9d77-321d-4cab-ab14-200f2fc72560-0
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.247
Circular design, almost like a
set of rings which are linked

649a9d77-321d-4cab-ab14-200f2fc72560-1
00:24:06.247 --> 00:24:11.365
together in a circle and
attending this event is is this

649a9d77-321d-4cab-ab14-200f2fc72560-2
00:24:11.365 --> 00:24:13.969
purple bird with a long tail.

b16c6c68-51e7-49e6-93f2-0b686c21f2f7-0
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:16.940
Um.

970afbb4-02ff-468c-860d-18295d4f91c6-0
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:24.767
And we we also see that the
children have these red

970afbb4-02ff-468c-860d-18295d4f91c6-1
00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:32.087
cylinders in their hands. Well,
the girl's is red, the boy's is

970afbb4-02ff-468c-860d-18295d4f91c6-2
00:24:32.087 --> 00:24:33.460
more purple.

34edc5d4-4706-48a0-b80a-744212a5a44b-0
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.180
Uh.

f7e23dd3-7d26-46b4-9188-917f2dbc4e38-0
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:46.540
And and then we we see the old
man.

19ea03a9-200e-46b4-a839-b0088dfa6679-0
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.770
Um, pointing out something

f2fd057a-1ccf-4620-9bc6-e7c22941f734-0
00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.934
To the boy. The boy seems to be
holding the the paper with the

f2fd057a-1ccf-4620-9bc6-e7c22941f734-1
00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:05.530
Purple bird sitting on his left
shoulder.

3af72c22-9816-4f5b-8ea9-436cc65815d3-0
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.950
Um, can't really make out what's
happening with the with the.

d9cb6285-fedc-4ab8-b02c-3266a7bbcc5c-0
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:21.385
Girl the girl. Oh, the the the
girl has put on this bandolier

d9cb6285-fedc-4ab8-b02c-3266a7bbcc5c-1
00:25:21.385 --> 00:25:28.280
um which the old man had been
wearing when he came out of the

d9cb6285-fedc-4ab8-b02c-3266a7bbcc5c-2
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.060
out of the door.

70f0a89e-19e3-4188-b817-abcb93840b76-0
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:37.908
And he the the old man has taken
the red cylinder that the girl

70f0a89e-19e3-4188-b817-abcb93840b76-1
00:25:37.908 --> 00:25:39.600
had been holding.

c61c351a-5153-4980-993e-820dbb603f8b-0
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:49.608
But now some armed soldiers come
out of the door too, and grab

c61c351a-5153-4980-993e-820dbb603f8b-1
00:25:49.608 --> 00:25:51.960
the old man. Um.

f4628025-d70d-45c7-b57f-a14bd70c1a62-0
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.000
The.

9528bb36-7c5a-42be-b842-1d6aa38fce7a-0
00:25:54.770 --> 00:26:00.446
Children are alarmed, but
there's still the the boy still

9528bb36-7c5a-42be-b842-1d6aa38fce7a-1
00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:06.319
has the scroll and the girl
still has the bandolier the the

9528bb36-7c5a-42be-b842-1d6aa38fce7a-2
00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:09.059
bird is flapping around and.

bde66d37-6f25-4ebb-abfd-91c0199182ff-0
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.190
With concern and.

7d5c0536-2950-43cf-8bd0-290e99a7e042-0
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.522
Something that the old man was
holding, like another cylinder

7d5c0536-2950-43cf-8bd0-290e99a7e042-1
00:26:17.522 --> 00:26:21.434
has, has just popped into the
air when the soldiers grabbed

7d5c0536-2950-43cf-8bd0-290e99a7e042-2
00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:25.281
him. The soldiers walk off with
the old man, take him back

7d5c0536-2950-43cf-8bd0-290e99a7e042-3
00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:26.390
through the door.

7b599784-8266-4fd1-bf31-0ced72d17251-0
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.308
The kids still have what they
had, and the that cylinder that

7b599784-8266-4fd1-bf31-0ced72d17251-1
00:26:32.308 --> 00:26:36.906
popped out of the old man's hand
and looking back, he had it when

7b599784-8266-4fd1-bf31-0ced72d17251-2
00:26:36.906 --> 00:26:40.320
he came through the door is
lying on the ground.

40bbec7c-8bf6-4f31-88bb-b04e41c16fc6-0
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.410
So the kids. So then I have the
door closes.

dba46c05-a3bb-4dbe-8f03-860174c99e21-0
00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.180
The kids.

ae69d01e-7f9c-4255-bf44-2ad25781c13a-0
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:59.371
Uh, are left alone. The the girl
picks up the orange cylinder

ae69d01e-7f9c-4255-bf44-2ad25781c13a-1
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:05.885
which the man had. The old man
had dropped, and the girl is

ae69d01e-7f9c-4255-bf44-2ad25781c13a-2
00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:09.360
using the Bandolier, the little.

305199c2-eddf-43ef-a8a3-dfc963ea118f-0
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.670
Little straps, the little I
don't know.

4342b372-399d-49d2-a4a0-14941b21addb-0
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:21.540
Receptacles on the bandolier to
hold that orange.

d8ec25ca-adf7-48b7-aaeb-aa3206a23e74-0
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:27.884
That orange cylinder. And so
they're they're they're

d8ec25ca-adf7-48b7-aaeb-aa3206a23e74-1
00:27:27.884 --> 00:27:29.760
wondering what to do.

7a2fc86c-9c2b-4b80-8e64-4698ffdf47db-0
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.940
Next.

f85e4b3b-14fb-4498-b423-e890c0c5dbc3-0
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.560
And.

ed25028f-171e-4d81-9076-9b91ff5580f1-0
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.040
Then.

4fe63163-ffbd-4031-85bb-3790f99b11bd-0
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:47.516
They're still standing by this
door, the birds flapping around.

4fe63163-ffbd-4031-85bb-3790f99b11bd-1
00:27:47.516 --> 00:27:48.720
And the girl

0163ab8b-f22e-4327-abca-e5d2154b25e2-0
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:57.619
Some things happened to the
orange cylinder so that it's got

0163ab8b-f22e-4327-abca-e5d2154b25e2-1
00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:58.110
this.

a17e7eb7-5be8-403e-b1ea-50fa0193afb8-0
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.010
I don't know. It's almost like a
a gun sight or a.

e2a8f909-b417-40fa-b196-725f647eeb13-0
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:12.271
Some attachment with the
circular top and she's looking

e2a8f909-b417-40fa-b196-725f647eeb13-1
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:13.270
through.

86eba224-1d33-465d-82a2-dbfa76ff5478-0
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.190
The circle but.

6ca18d66-84db-4035-90ca-85838f91ddf7-0
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:19.970
Oh.

b5f397fa-6324-4b17-8a75-b702e2b8a4b8-0
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.100
It turns out that.

eb736002-6844-48da-bab6-0ab0e0376143-0
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.390
That somehow

80ac603d-ef57-4cda-a76a-d2d281d8085c-0
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.990
These cylinders that they have
turned into a key.

3f421c6f-cbb6-4d66-8f26-cd1f9607e24a-0
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:40.254
Which they use to open the door,
and they run through the door

3f421c6f-cbb6-4d66-8f26-cd1f9607e24a-1
00:28:40.254 --> 00:28:44.807
where the soldiers are taking
the old man and the bird is

3f421c6f-cbb6-4d66-8f26-cd1f9607e24a-2
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:46.220
flying after them.

4acc8ba2-6de9-49a4-8233-419fecf058ff-0
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.450
So when they get through the
door.

87985977-cd96-494b-9846-509c5d6ea022-0
00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:01.800
They emerge from this rock in
this whole new world.

da626ac7-f266-463c-8c91-d55bab784250-0
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.944
Where there's a lake and the
castle and uh machines flying

da626ac7-f266-463c-8c91-d55bab784250-1
00:29:11.944 --> 00:29:19.620
through the air and the the old
man being taken through.

3545d956-544a-4c94-b0a8-6ae561203611-0
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:28.658
A big Watergate in into into the
castle. It's a stern Wheeler

3545d956-544a-4c94-b0a8-6ae561203611-1
00:29:28.658 --> 00:29:36.270
ship that is carrying him
through, surrounded by soldiers.

aed21954-1d26-4098-8ff6-67c81bafcaea-0
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.350
And they're they're watching
this scene.

71080afb-b277-4d9d-9b43-97d0aa1e17c0-0
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.220
In amazement.

153d3b20-758d-4066-bc85-f713327c19a0-0
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.534
There there's also some
mysterious stuff going on with

153d3b20-758d-4066-bc85-f713327c19a0-1
00:29:49.534 --> 00:29:53.678
fires in some of the some of the
towers on the left, so there may

153d3b20-758d-4066-bc85-f713327c19a0-2
00:29:53.678 --> 00:29:57.070
be some trouble in this castle.
We're not quite sure.

eb4c6e07-1281-450c-9f60-37ffaf702e82-0
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.100
OK, proceed.

13d57374-3707-45ec-93e8-f0cdc16dcd65-0
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.550
So.

07e5e467-cea1-4b21-beba-2aa7bb0e0bce-0
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.360
ah now the perspective changes
and we see that.

1791832d-c2fe-4aa4-9c2a-51ad580455d5-0
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.900
The ship is not actually going
through a Watergate into the

1791832d-c2fe-4aa4-9c2a-51ad580455d5-1
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.434
city, but it's going through a,
a a an archway which leads out

1791832d-c2fe-4aa4-9c2a-51ad580455d5-2
00:30:20.434 --> 00:30:21.840
to the open sea.

7ba458f3-9dca-4e94-9e26-2f960e675253-0
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.850
And uh the the archway is uh has
a.

2ad4713a-02b5-459a-a2e3-5a5e9a9af3f5-0
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:37.122
An aqueduct on top where there
where boats are moving across

2ad4713a-02b5-459a-a2e3-5a5e9a9af3f5-1
00:30:37.122 --> 00:30:43.655
but we still see fires in the
city so there may be some some

2ad4713a-02b5-459a-a2e3-5a5e9a9af3f5-2
00:30:43.655 --> 00:30:49.760
some trouble but the boy has
looked has has opened this.

5649b90b-d13f-422e-838f-42427c3d4ff1-0
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.776
Paper that we saw with the
circles on and now we see it's a

5649b90b-d13f-422e-838f-42427c3d4ff1-1
00:30:55.776 --> 00:30:56.090
map.

4cd16788-d4c2-4405-b357-5705e73e147a-0
00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.150
And the the map.

25ce6350-05e1-405d-b813-38694a2857da-0
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:08.690
Is a a map of this this
mysterious world.

d4bccd90-c599-422a-aad2-1b080f554508-0
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.920
And he's pointing at.

be2db49f-078d-4385-bb70-3f8eac260782-0
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:21.727
A picture of a of a of a temple
that the the circles are on that

be2db49f-078d-4385-bb70-3f8eac260782-1
00:31:21.727 --> 00:31:27.624
that we've seen before that were
linked are are each of the

be2db49f-078d-4385-bb70-3f8eac260782-2
00:31:27.624 --> 00:31:33.127
circles has a picture of a of a
location with different

be2db49f-078d-4385-bb70-3f8eac260782-3
00:31:33.127 --> 00:31:34.110
locations.

e7f511f0-337b-4f67-aba3-c66b6b5cc5a4-0
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.956
This looks like a an underwater
temple because there are fish

e7f511f0-337b-4f67-aba3-c66b6b5cc5a4-1
00:31:40.956 --> 00:31:44.020
that looks like it's under it
looks like the temple, it's

e7f511f0-337b-4f67-aba3-c66b6b5cc5a4-2
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.138
underwater. There are fish
swimming around the one. That's

e7f511f0-337b-4f67-aba3-c66b6b5cc5a4-3
00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:50.149
the one he's pointing at. But
then there are, there are.

4733b1bd-0888-407c-b73e-440db1c9aa6b-0
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.690
Five others.

919f3c05-e077-4bc4-a3b0-3bafc6238035-0
00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:01.205
Maybe the edge of a bridge, a
mountain, a tropical island, a

919f3c05-e077-4bc4-a3b0-3bafc6238035-1
00:32:01.205 --> 00:32:07.507
forest with, with lanterns
hanging from a tree which has a

919f3c05-e077-4bc4-a3b0-3bafc6238035-2
00:32:07.507 --> 00:32:14.450
door in the foot and and then a
city which and in fact the city.

fee81686-d72f-41c1-9b8e-858244b038c6-0
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.085
Is the one that corresponds most
closely to the scene that the

fee81686-d72f-41c1-9b8e-858244b038c6-1
00:32:20.085 --> 00:32:22.490
children actually find
themselves in.

9fef1c0f-7dd5-4941-ba77-d8423fe78dda-0
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:34.627
So now we see the children are
still in the the rock that they

9fef1c0f-7dd5-4941-ba77-d8423fe78dda-1
00:32:34.627 --> 00:32:40.392
came to when they came through
the door, but there are people

9fef1c0f-7dd5-4941-ba77-d8423fe78dda-2
00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:43.740
in boats that are approaching
them.

c5ed35ef-639c-4c39-ba78-9e1aaeec566b-0
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.140
And the suspicion is that those
people.

63c7d7f2-e969-47bb-a96a-0a680d25e5a0-0
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.060
Are after the kids. That they're
not supposed to be there.

35742485-0b8c-4d7f-af1a-697a57d2735e-0
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:59.010
And they may be trying to
capture them or do them harm.

dd7628fe-8b7b-4768-868e-f02d8190035a-0
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.840
But that's where these.

a7c3e96e-6579-418c-9a55-90def44dacc9-0
00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.320
These cylinders that the kids
have been holding.

61a2f219-57cf-4f7a-9e9b-c95e4615d017-0
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.180
Uh, proved to be useful because
somehow they make out of.

787ca1b1-3732-4f95-b550-7d9566d1db73-0
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:24.537
Diving equipment so they have
fins for their, flippers for

787ca1b1-3732-4f95-b550-7d9566d1db73-1
00:33:24.537 --> 00:33:25.460
their feet.

f55fbd12-5cc3-4275-b374-2b9b81d4ac6b-0
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:27.840
And.

36d12764-f674-4c8d-8b77-df1fb0a90878-0
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.150
The bird.

c7531700-3e59-4fe3-8605-384c42bb5160-0
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.950
The Purple bird is somehow also
helping them.

f63ca797-99f5-4810-8ba1-790af5c90c95-0
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.370
This the the girl.

20148fe4-b537-4a85-a0e9-9483a9dcba4a-0
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.970
uses the.

d929e4aa-c768-470d-8a01-a85ad0ca5125-0
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.349
The red cylinder to create the
flippers, but she's also

d929e4aa-c768-470d-8a01-a85ad0ca5125-1
00:33:50.349 --> 00:33:51.660
creating some other.

8d6bd7d8-427a-4b13-8a0d-c7e5072030c4-0
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.840
Thing which is not clear is like
a ball or a.

ba3a6861-d5ba-4f12-8855-ecf298918845-0
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.320
Maybe it's something to help
them breathe under.

56477c7a-dfd0-4206-926a-1efae74a6768-0
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:02.770
Water.

e72a4223-c126-4bfd-9bcc-7897fcb6cd79-0
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.340
But anyway, they, they and the
bird both dive in the into the

e72a4223-c126-4bfd-9bcc-7897fcb6cd79-1
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:15.350
water to escape the people who
are approaching them.

0e8a20e8-f313-4d89-9a13-ffa65d514f3d-0
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:24.529
Oh, and the bird has turned into
what looks like a an octopus or

0e8a20e8-f313-4d89-9a13-ffa65d514f3d-1
00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:29.936
a squid, and the circles are now
revealed to be diving helmets

0e8a20e8-f313-4d89-9a13-ffa65d514f3d-2
00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:30.280
and.

e87059ff-26d2-4e06-951b-e136dbe193f5-0
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:38.025
And also oxygen cylinders that
the girl has has drawn using

e87059ff-26d2-4e06-951b-e136dbe193f5-1
00:34:38.025 --> 00:34:39.270
this magic.

a5165aa7-2ed5-4fcc-b442-e6e7ddfca13a-0
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:48.226
Red cylinder and the the purple
bird, now turned into a a squid

a5165aa7-2ed5-4fcc-b442-e6e7ddfca13a-1
00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:50.510
or an octopus is is.

6f9c8e06-8d9a-4f5c-97dd-788607e60a3c-0
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:57.775
It's pulling them towards this
underwater temple that the boy

6f9c8e06-8d9a-4f5c-97dd-788607e60a3c-1
00:34:57.775 --> 00:35:03.556
had seen on on the map. The
various fish swimming around and

6f9c8e06-8d9a-4f5c-97dd-788607e60a3c-2
00:35:03.556 --> 00:35:06.019
the temple is lit by this.

4d6267dc-654d-47d6-9a2f-12724548f32f-0
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.430
By a light, a mysterious light.

e2d687b1-8959-4093-b08e-88bb3bd65173-0
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.950
And they get there.

078eeb94-c004-4526-98d1-d616b98686ee-0
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:22.240
And they see that the source of
this light is.

c8d3bc64-90b5-4098-83fd-bd58891761a6-0
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.350
Something that is.

941869eb-4c1e-444a-ba75-faf971556fb1-0
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:30.060
On a on a pedestal in the centre
of the the temple.

fe97d0b7-50e4-4650-9fd2-872a8ed08566-0
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.110
Um.

a0b67591-6d37-4647-b6e7-b7cee545cd3a-0
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.310
And I think the girl takes it
takes this.

f4648631-a261-42b6-953f-f3260182f9d1-0
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.000
Precious object.

8cffacfa-ddb0-4544-bbae-39f8c59ccafd-0
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.353
And she's holding in her hand,
and they're making their escape

8cffacfa-ddb0-4544-bbae-39f8c59ccafd-1
00:35:51.353 --> 00:35:52.800
again, holding onto this.

4048f6cb-09e0-4b00-8b68-d4968e2afdc1-0
00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.355
Squid. Oh, the squid and the
bird are actually separate. I

4048f6cb-09e0-4b00-8b68-d4968e2afdc1-1
00:36:00.355 --> 00:36:05.534
had thought, I thought that they
were the same, maybe the maybe

4048f6cb-09e0-4b00-8b68-d4968e2afdc1-2
00:36:05.534 --> 00:36:10.229
the purple birds split. But
anyway, there's a there's a a

4048f6cb-09e0-4b00-8b68-d4968e2afdc1-3
00:36:10.229 --> 00:36:15.408
purple bird and a squid, purple
squid which are separately. The

4048f6cb-09e0-4b00-8b68-d4968e2afdc1-4
00:36:15.408 --> 00:36:18.970
the squid is helping them get
away because.

070def96-bc92-445c-836f-9a3c2ca063c9-0
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.176
Some, some inhabitants of this
underwater world have spotted

070def96-bc92-445c-836f-9a3c2ca063c9-1
00:36:26.176 --> 00:36:26.570
them.

f2d52f56-bbb8-4e20-9a45-6e0309746bdf-0
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.190
And.

2217f6cd-57fd-49c2-873c-fec34c531774-0
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.163
They don't like the fact that
the girl has stolen this

2217f6cd-57fd-49c2-873c-fec34c531774-1
00:36:33.163 --> 00:36:37.705
precious object which was at the
center of the temple, and

2217f6cd-57fd-49c2-873c-fec34c531774-2
00:36:37.705 --> 00:36:42.478
they're chasing them and they
have Spears and probably intend

2217f6cd-57fd-49c2-873c-fec34c531774-3
00:36:42.478 --> 00:36:43.710
to do them harm.

2f697358-463d-4824-8abe-3c73a3922d2c-0
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.830
So they they get out of the
water.

cdc790b7-2fda-4196-854d-e9346bad05c7-0
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.170
Um.

5db09a95-6c93-4b64-b7dd-344da8d9c600-0
00:36:53.930 --> 00:37:01.594
And uh, move on to an island
where the the bird is was also

5db09a95-6c93-4b64-b7dd-344da8d9c600-1
00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:04.660
help, helping lead them.

8b0a4720-0c8c-4099-8a19-a6f942aa8a14-0
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.608
And they're using these
wonderful crayons to draw

8b0a4720-0c8c-4099-8a19-a6f942aa8a14-1
00:37:10.608 --> 00:37:16.211
Something which is going to help
them. It's almost looks like

8b0a4720-0c8c-4099-8a19-a6f942aa8a14-2
00:37:16.211 --> 00:37:21.362
it's going to be like an
elephant or something that they

8b0a4720-0c8c-4099-8a19-a6f942aa8a14-3
00:37:21.362 --> 00:37:23.260
can ride away on, but

d5212357-a389-4c28-aed2-5ce9a16f62ad-0
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:29.155
Um, we have to wait until the
next picture to see what it

d5212357-a389-4c28-aed2-5ce9a16f62ad-1
00:37:29.155 --> 00:37:33.621
actually is. But these these
crayons can help them. Oh, it's

d5212357-a389-4c28-aed2-5ce9a16f62ad-2
00:37:33.621 --> 00:37:38.233
a it's a rhinoceros. It's not a
it's not an elephant, but that

d5212357-a389-4c28-aed2-5ce9a16f62ad-3
00:37:38.233 --> 00:37:39.990
they've managed to draw.

7405fd1a-25ed-4346-a742-eaae25ebf7c0-0
00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:42.660
With a little.

51f6d699-4402-4ced-b660-8157e226d56a-0
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.710
Uh.

9425970b-0df9-4b7c-b89c-080ed55222e3-0
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.681
Somewhere it's an elaborate
saddle, a place where they can

9425970b-0df9-4b7c-b89c-080ed55222e3-1
00:37:50.681 --> 00:37:53.890
ride. It's also got a roof. And
they're going down this.

baec22c2-fe69-4082-a1e1-a0bb8c12269d-0
00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.150
Trail towards a jungle temple.

a68b7a9b-3a46-470e-b301-098a523db85f-0
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:10.390
Uh, it's almost Mayan like in
the steps that.

72b56900-4a3b-4807-9931-4e31de948c2d-0
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:18.447
That rise up from the base of
the temple to its its peak and

72b56900-4a3b-4807-9931-4e31de948c2d-1
00:38:18.447 --> 00:38:23.929
there there are in fact multiple
structures in this jungle

72b56900-4a3b-4807-9931-4e31de948c2d-2
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:24.580
temple.

dd4fa00b-25b6-405b-8e22-4c48e0f49559-0
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:31.400
Uh, and we also see that to the
right.

ec79cf30-277e-4432-ab9a-633ba006716c-0
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.280
Of this.

e5639751-0de8-4d02-9670-8021b1017871-0
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.330
These structures there's there's
also a.

4bdfce22-0f74-4692-8df9-dab7ed85865a-0
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.960
Umm.

d33cec7b-b5e2-4619-a30c-29c7095388b5-0
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:49.280
I guess it's a Cliff with a a a
rope bridge leading to.

d7895049-1395-424e-a411-d0a97ba853f1-0
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:57.422
An island with a a a stone tower
the the rope bridge connects

d7895049-1395-424e-a411-d0a97ba853f1-1
00:38:57.422 --> 00:39:03.392
from the edge of the Cliff to
the top of the stone tower,

d7895049-1395-424e-a411-d0a97ba853f1-2
00:39:03.392 --> 00:39:10.084
which is a similar architecture
to the to the temples and the in

d7895049-1395-424e-a411-d0a97ba853f1-3
00:39:10.084 --> 00:39:12.040
the jungle and the.

d5a44610-7d64-4db1-b1d7-c7d1a2b35302-0
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.390
That the.

9a1790db-77a9-4c66-a784-ba136a2f0519-0
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.324
Structure at the end of the rope
bridge is in fact inside in in

9a1790db-77a9-4c66-a784-ba136a2f0519-1
00:39:21.324 --> 00:39:21.870
the sea.

cb387c4b-1943-456e-ad1b-d2bb33a5415c-0
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:33.803
With the and and we we view that
over the the very lush luxuriant

cb387c4b-1943-456e-ad1b-d2bb33a5415c-1
00:39:33.803 --> 00:39:34.850
jungle.

a2f89914-4e52-4765-8e49-856927b974a8-0
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:42.088
So now of course, the the
children have reached the edge

a2f89914-4e52-4765-8e49-856927b974a8-1
00:39:42.088 --> 00:39:46.220
of the Cliff and are rushing
over the bridge.

9a897c10-c7f1-4956-ab8a-39392a8288e7-0
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:55.074
The rope bridge, um, led on by
the Purple Bird to the to this

9a897c10-c7f1-4956-ab8a-39392a8288e7-1
00:39:55.074 --> 00:40:00.450
structure we see there's a light
on top of the.

ebca3ae7-04ab-4df1-99f4-1c152de0cb29-0
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.590
On the top of the tower.

24f21ce8-a95d-4422-ae67-975b325d9680-0
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:12.198
And we're gonna find out. So
they get to the top of the the

24f21ce8-a95d-4422-ae67-975b325d9680-1
00:40:12.198 --> 00:40:15.150
tower somehow they they climb
up.

3f03e665-eccb-41f3-8296-7591f88e9cad-0
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.340
But they're pursued by soldiers
with Spears.

38d3e345-10e7-460a-8e73-8e26b60cd472-0
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:29.580
There, uh, and there is no
obvious escape.

22f9dc2c-811e-4030-87a3-bb0321895269-0
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:37.630
But they again use their magic,
uh, pencils,

b7fe1b63-0591-4862-abd6-11af5628ffdb-0
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:44.387
Magic markers to produce
something which is going to help

b7fe1b63-0591-4862-abd6-11af5628ffdb-1
00:40:44.387 --> 00:40:50.190
them escape. It's not exactly
clear what that's going to be,

b7fe1b63-0591-4862-abd6-11af5628ffdb-2
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:55.803
but on the next thing we find
out that they produce a it's

b7fe1b63-0591-4862-abd6-11af5628ffdb-3
00:40:55.803 --> 00:40:57.040
like a swing.

c30db1e8-c43e-4ea6-8e89-cf67c747a513-0
00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.240
With.

b1c027e5-5f27-4ce1-b2c7-4ed342920f59-0
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.640
Long ropes that.

3ea8a206-648a-49d8-affa-cc8c50144b77-0
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:12.665
are held by a purple dragonfly.
Maybe the bird transformed into

3ea8a206-648a-49d8-affa-cc8c50144b77-1
00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:17.820
a dragonfly again, but they are
are.

a8ce7983-e466-48d4-ad11-684d6d966330-0
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:26.428
They escape from the grasp of
the of the soldiers who almost

a8ce7983-e466-48d4-ad11-684d6d966330-1
00:41:26.428 --> 00:41:32.688
get them, but not quite, by
flying away on this on this

a8ce7983-e466-48d4-ad11-684d6d966330-2
00:41:32.688 --> 00:41:39.619
swing seat which is pulled by
this this dragonfly and they're

a8ce7983-e466-48d4-ad11-684d6d966330-3
00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:46.214
flying across the the water
towards a mountain range where

a8ce7983-e466-48d4-ad11-684d6d966330-4
00:41:46.214 --> 00:41:49.680
the mountains are are are high.

8f806bf5-16b3-4754-93c3-ec3fe4cce7b4-0
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.580
And snow capped at the at the
peak.

40740e2d-24ca-4606-83d0-a5637287e397-0
00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.755
And they are so so the the ohh I
see the dragonfly was was in

40740e2d-24ca-4606-83d0-a5637287e397-1
00:42:01.755 --> 00:42:07.531
fact something that was drawn by
them, because the purple bird is

40740e2d-24ca-4606-83d0-a5637287e397-2
00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:12.869
still a purple bird and it's
followed them and the dragonfly

40740e2d-24ca-4606-83d0-a5637287e397-3
00:42:12.869 --> 00:42:17.419
lets them off on top of a
temple. It looks like a a

40740e2d-24ca-4606-83d0-a5637287e397-4
00:42:17.419 --> 00:42:18.819
Buddhist temple.

12653123-bbd0-41bc-89fe-01a216a7b218-0
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.528
Which is probably on top of the
mountain that we saw in the

12653123-bbd0-41bc-89fe-01a216a7b218-1
00:42:25.528 --> 00:42:30.138
previous picture. But these
these soldiers are resourceful

12653123-bbd0-41bc-89fe-01a216a7b218-2
00:42:30.138 --> 00:42:35.139
and they're coming after them in
these airship like things with

12653123-bbd0-41bc-89fe-01a216a7b218-3
00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:39.436
which are suspended from
balloons. We saw, we actually

12653123-bbd0-41bc-89fe-01a216a7b218-4
00:42:39.436 --> 00:42:41.390
saw them in the original.

1012858a-9c67-4441-a8ab-ec19a48eded2-0
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:42.880
Picture.

2d30659b-1bb8-421a-82dd-f662137106fa-0
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.038
So they they're sitting on top,
they're standing on top of the

2d30659b-1bb8-421a-82dd-f662137106fa-1
00:42:51.038 --> 00:42:52.030
the temple.

c1a829e8-5f02-400b-9741-73c3cbe6b9f9-0
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:59.669
And they seem to actually have
acquired more of these magic

c1a829e8-5f02-400b-9741-73c3cbe6b9f9-1
00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:06.395
crayons that the the girl has on
a bandolier, which she's now

c1a829e8-5f02-400b-9741-73c3cbe6b9f9-2
00:43:06.395 --> 00:43:07.480
taken off.

53c44212-4262-4754-9828-4e071293851b-0
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.650
Um and.

67eb3424-16c6-4370-9ca1-bea8653d1f05-0
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.213
It's not quite clear what
they're gonna do yet, but

67eb3424-16c6-4370-9ca1-bea8653d1f05-1
00:43:15.213 --> 00:43:18.529
they're probably gonna do
something with these these

67eb3424-16c6-4370-9ca1-bea8653d1f05-2
00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:19.030
crayons.

c5179e75-661b-495f-9771-347c73f2920c-0
00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:28.070
So the soldiers in the airships
are closing in on them.

ecc4d55d-d060-428f-8c0e-e33bc1b54e0f-0
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.760
There there are quite a lot of
them. And um.

ade9b959-1526-4747-bd11-3532e1c554d6-0
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.403
There's no obvious escape from
this, from the peak of this, of

ade9b959-1526-4747-bd11-3532e1c554d6-1
00:43:41.403 --> 00:43:42.570
this temple.

8c240c9b-4642-4dc0-82cb-b61f04dbb907-0
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.020
There are.

08cbf33a-3320-49ca-8045-1cc94d86b455-0
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:53.989
Specks of white in the air,
which are probably is probably

08cbf33a-3320-49ca-8045-1cc94d86b455-1
00:43:53.989 --> 00:43:54.340
snow.

07f722c5-bb66-469b-a056-baf380db2e21-0
00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:03.973
And one of the soldiers is
reaching for the for the bird

07f722c5-bb66-469b-a056-baf380db2e21-1
00:44:03.973 --> 00:44:10.420
which is fluttering above the
the children. And the bird, I

07f722c5-bb66-469b-a056-baf380db2e21-2
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:17.403
think, has the the bandolier in
its claws. The girl doesn't seem

07f722c5-bb66-469b-a056-baf380db2e21-3
00:44:17.403 --> 00:44:23.850
to have it anymore. So it may be
that the the soldiers are.

590fab62-3886-4d47-8c28-040c66826396-0
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.290
After the bandolier.

5e585766-1350-44b2-ae3b-b1c1cc33ecde-0
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.770
As well or in the instead of the
children.

de245c02-3d21-4beb-a489-7eb68bfb172a-0
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.490
The.

b759bff9-d5ed-446c-ad48-8ebade69a178-0
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:41.726
There is a light, and I think
it's coming from a Lantern that

b759bff9-d5ed-446c-ad48-8ebade69a178-1
00:44:41.726 --> 00:44:46.356
the soldier in the airship on
the on the right above the

b759bff9-d5ed-446c-ad48-8ebade69a178-2
00:44:46.356 --> 00:44:49.200
children is holding, but it
makes.

3ae2ef65-c189-4e38-a3ea-a7896a113443-0
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.394
An unusual illumination of the
soldier and the airship on the

3ae2ef65-c189-4e38-a3ea-a7896a113443-1
00:44:55.394 --> 00:44:55.690
left.

cd03ac2b-8ef2-4820-8f05-938193441fcc-0
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.820
So.

04f1b40b-9f2c-4581-a83b-ba4a855a6a0b-0
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.270
unclear what's going to happen
next,

87d55d9c-fbd2-480c-ac3b-d6986d139d71-0
00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:04.340
But.

55c576d3-8e2f-44f9-af45-62617e35f9ec-0
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.070
The bird with the bandolier.

38bef6d7-62ae-4402-8f11-3be39a8afa50-0
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:18.899
Moves and and draws a rainbow
with the different colours of

38bef6d7-62ae-4402-8f11-3be39a8afa50-1
00:45:18.899 --> 00:45:19.360
of.

b2adeb3b-ee4a-4511-856d-519ba3a96497-0
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:29.053
Pencil that are are in that
Bandelier and the rainbow has

b2adeb3b-ee4a-4511-856d-519ba3a96497-1
00:45:29.053 --> 00:45:29.800
this.

4f79b859-5ba8-4261-a0d3-04fbd768dff5-0
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:38.494
Strange effects of of blowing
away the airships with the

4f79b859-5ba8-4261-a0d3-04fbd768dff5-1
00:45:38.494 --> 00:45:43.840
soldiers. In fact, it it blows
them over.

9c7af28e-c2f9-4add-b25a-9f4a7144928d-0
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:50.550
And and the soldiers are are
falling out.

2b15628a-a5ce-435f-8442-40466a1f171d-0
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.900
And this this tremendous.

47edd14e-e435-443d-803f-dffc9ec1e347-0
00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.167
uh blast of energy that is
coming from this, from this

47edd14e-e435-443d-803f-dffc9ec1e347-1
00:46:00.167 --> 00:46:04.765
rainbow that the bird is
producing. So the, the children

47edd14e-e435-443d-803f-dffc9ec1e347-2
00:46:04.765 --> 00:46:09.929
are are are safe there. They're,
they're rescued and and we see

47edd14e-e435-443d-803f-dffc9ec1e347-3
00:46:09.929 --> 00:46:11.220
in the distance.

96f6b788-2dfb-45f9-8f86-afc833e51895-0
00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.734
A city which is looks like the
original. Well no it's not the

96f6b788-2dfb-45f9-8f86-afc833e51895-1
00:46:16.734 --> 00:46:20.754
original city. It looks similar
to the original to the city

96f6b788-2dfb-45f9-8f86-afc833e51895-2
00:46:20.754 --> 00:46:24.841
where they came out, but I think
it's different. But anyway,

96f6b788-2dfb-45f9-8f86-afc833e51895-3
00:46:24.841 --> 00:46:27.789
that's where the bird is
heading. And then.

292708c1-871e-4878-8614-1030c80263ca-0
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.370
We see that the other end of the
rainbow.

729ed30a-4cfe-4b07-baad-693e581a9a02-0
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:34.690
Is.

cf35c7f6-503f-41b4-bcc4-6b72805ec71f-0
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:44.013
Coming down on the boat that
where the old man, the the king

cf35c7f6-503f-41b4-bcc4-6b72805ec71f-1
00:46:44.013 --> 00:46:45.550
like figure.

a794d217-1a1b-4bc7-8831-381e5f385d99-0
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:53.953
Had had been been taken by the
by the soldiers and the soldiers

a794d217-1a1b-4bc7-8831-381e5f385d99-1
00:46:53.953 --> 00:46:59.856
on that boat are all getting
blasted by the this energetic

a794d217-1a1b-4bc7-8831-381e5f385d99-2
00:46:59.856 --> 00:47:05.760
rainbow that the the bird had
created and the the king is.

d74d003c-3251-40a4-bc95-d59148b1c843-0
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:15.550
Joyful and um hailing the the
power of this, of this rainbow.

91a97b34-6143-4789-90fb-4486c0aaf362-0
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:22.840
And uh, is, which is liberating
him from the soldiers that had

91a97b34-6143-4789-90fb-4486c0aaf362-1
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.480
been trying to take him away to
uncertain fate.

58ed0ea0-fe9a-4432-a1cb-1054519f8003-0
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.870
And here now the.

847ae6f8-904b-4462-95ad-a15963601a31-0
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:43.300
The children and the the old man
are reunited.

d2a3c372-250e-4e6c-827c-25b1cdec0263-0
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:52.240
On the the the purple rhinoceros
that the the kids had ridden

d2a3c372-250e-4e6c-827c-25b1cdec0263-1
00:47:52.240 --> 00:48:00.217
earlier. It looks like the king
has basically been restored to

d2a3c372-250e-4e6c-827c-25b1cdec0263-2
00:48:00.217 --> 00:48:08.194
his rightful throne. The rainbow
is illuminating the city with

d2a3c372-250e-4e6c-827c-25b1cdec0263-3
00:48:08.194 --> 00:48:10.600

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:33.153
In the city of of various kinds.
Some look official, some just

d1125db4-93ac-42ca-af80-0c54ca52c9c0-1
00:48:33.153 --> 00:48:39.800
look like towns towns
townspeople. But the order and.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.690
Joy and goodness has been
restored.

072c8b24-50e6-45c2-9564-75ddc2e0daa7-0
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.055
So now it's time for the
children to go home, having done

072c8b24-50e6-45c2-9564-75ddc2e0daa7-1
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:54.130
their part in rescuing the.

The The the King and restoring
order to this mysterious

00:49:01.323 --> 00:49:02.180
Kingdom.

593520e7-9c7f-46fc-b60b-274db50dc174-0
00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.600
And the king takes them back to
the.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.410
The door back to their world.

99d15bcd-aeb8-497c-b965-1d77ae1b912a-0
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:20.559
Um, but before they go the the
the King uses one of these magic

99d15bcd-aeb8-497c-b965-1d77ae1b912a-1
00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:26.090
markers to produce crowns for
the children and um.

93ea15c9-5cef-471e-8564-02ba8e738da6-0
00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.590
Sends them back with his
profound thanks.

6ac4d35e-cb9d-416c-bc34-ac1d4f348dab-0
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.910
And the children go back to
their.

297d2039-7473-44c7-8a5b-c1e0aaa44c62-0
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:43.913
To their city, they come out
under the bridge through this

297d2039-7473-44c7-8a5b-c1e0aaa44c62-1
00:49:43.913 --> 00:49:48.707
magic door and they see that
same rainbow or a similar

297d2039-7473-44c7-8a5b-c1e0aaa44c62-2
00:49:48.707 --> 00:49:50.800
rainbow over their city.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:57.330

with them.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:04.450
And somehow they brought the
magic of this other Kingdom back

b2c7df8f-d7c9-47ce-80b7-4bc854c1931e-1
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:08.320

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.130
OK, so that was the story.

63e67c2f-901b-4b72-81fe-743cc611ebe1-0
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:18.621
So then this next one, we're
going back to a complex scene

63e67c2f-901b-4b72-81fe-743cc611ebe1-1
00:50:18.621 --> 00:50:23.027
again. Just describe it.
Describe what you see and what

63e67c2f-901b-4b72-81fe-743cc611ebe1-2
00:50:23.027 --> 00:50:24.050
is happening.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.340
And.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:31.290
We're aiming for between three
and five minutes, OK, alright.

c9b1a2bc-4be4-4a7a-9875-150e538f0514-0
00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:36.510
So it's just one slide, one
picture. OK. Yes.

e897eb6c-fa06-4ee3-8b61-e32af0b75809-0
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:48.973
#START_exhibit_12 OK, so we see
a scene with a lot of people.

e897eb6c-fa06-4ee3-8b61-e32af0b75809-1
00:50:48.973 --> 00:50:57.310
There are. It's a big, big room
with three levels.

9196db1b-4834-4835-8d53-b85504e65473-0
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:02.890
There are portraits all around.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.613
This this large room, some of
which are on the wall and some

546f1476-5b16-4212-8b2e-40cb332e8469-1
00:51:08.613 --> 00:51:10.010

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:28.827
I see that there are there are
staircases which link the levels

aaa275e1-ae4b-4729-8927-0384cef577a3-1
00:51:28.827 --> 00:51:31.770
of these rooms, and I see
people.

59ad0731-a1a9-419b-bff6-ebb135e47cb5-0
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:38.070
Moving portraits up and down
these staircases.

90b5badc-d805-4bef-8a98-bcd2bbc04618-0
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.240
There are.

a9d46827-d4a7-4af4-90a1-316daafb9a0b-0
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:53.028
ah in in the in the center there
there's a a group of people

a9d46827-d4a7-4af4-90a1-316daafb9a0b-1
00:51:53.028 --> 00:51:58.297
dressed in blue. I'm assuming
they're, they're, they're

a9d46827-d4a7-4af4-90a1-316daafb9a0b-2
00:51:58.297 --> 00:52:04.036
policemen and they may be trying
to bring some order to this

a9d46827-d4a7-4af4-90a1-316daafb9a0b-3
00:52:04.036 --> 00:52:09.493
scene. Somebody, some people may
be trying to steal these

a9d46827-d4a7-4af4-90a1-316daafb9a0b-4
00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.340

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:18.420
While others are just there to
to look at them.

7887fd17-4420-4a02-ad4b-b7b9675b42f0-0
00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:27.754
The the pictures are on the
walls are of a variety of of

7887fd17-4420-4a02-ad4b-b7b9675b42f0-1
00:52:27.754 --> 00:52:33.190
different things. Many of them
are are people, but not all.

649d09a8-cbfe-43de-97df-03c7dc8fbf8c-0
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.550
So there's a.

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:45.765
Clown and there's a a picture of
a couple together. It's almost

ed0b1cc1-0099-4e53-b090-fe5290c6cd84-1
00:52:45.765 --> 00:52:48.080
like American Gothic.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:01.520
Maybe holding a a a club or a
stick of some kind.

aa59d4da-376f-4dbb-a8b1-6a1d4615e458-0
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:11.680
There there's one unusual
picture of. It, it's almost like

aa59d4da-376f-4dbb-a8b1-6a1d4615e458-1
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.550
a poster that.

a44cea3d-59b3-4bbc-b3f5-d6728397cb8e-0
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.890
But uh.

0f19fdaf-49a8-4794-a9ef-78919856c94b-0
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:25.348
A Workman is trying to paste up
on on on the wall and that has a

0f19fdaf-49a8-4794-a9ef-78919856c94b-1
00:53:25.348 --> 00:53:28.930
very large faces on it there.

36b2dc1e-9cb2-430a-9337-493569add3e0-0
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:30.770
There.

4fcfacec-4018-4b1e-98cf-60353d743a69-0
00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.610
And in some cases the.

61d2c9e6-bedd-4ede-a110-37bb8faf06ce-0
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.480
Pictures.

a836e95e-7cce-47f1-a4fd-ce416bcb85b2-0
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:49.023
And the the real life people are
are reflective of each other. So

a836e95e-7cce-47f1-a4fd-ce416bcb85b2-1
00:53:49.023 --> 00:53:55.196
there's a picture of a of a
horse with a with a knight on

a836e95e-7cce-47f1-a4fd-ce416bcb85b2-2
00:53:55.196 --> 00:54:01.475
it. Yet, standing right next to
it is a looks like a, a, a

a836e95e-7cce-47f1-a4fd-ce416bcb85b2-3
00:54:01.475 --> 00:54:05.200
wooden horse with a man riding
it.

d1d3f430-1ef3-40a2-903e-66e27f78f857-0
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.660
In a similar kind of post to the
picture.

561e9dc8-7c19-40b0-9f28-b26392b52af3-0
00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.470
We. We.

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:14.820
We see.

4626c541-4af4-4831-9052-b50f71877373-0
00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:19.200
Um.

0a32afd2-b098-49dc-ac1a-38090f972047-0
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:30.110
A couple of people in in the
middle level. There are workmen

0a32afd2-b098-49dc-ac1a-38090f972047-1
00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:30.810
holding.

they're they're, they're,

2c8b3258-c1f1-49bf-9b92-5f0ecde9c51c-1
00:54:37.298 --> 00:54:42.884
they're standing in in in midair
that they're holding a picture

2c8b3258-c1f1-49bf-9b92-5f0ecde9c51c-2
00:54:42.884 --> 00:54:44.630
of. It looks like a.

9a1d58f3-0281-4280-939d-4dbd68cfe7b1-0
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:51.096
A. A ball from a ball and chain.
Hmm. And they're they're they're

9a1d58f3-0281-4280-939d-4dbd68cfe7b1-1
00:54:51.096 --> 00:54:55.713
holding it up without any
visible means of support. It's

9a1d58f3-0281-4280-939d-4dbd68cfe7b1-2
00:54:55.713 --> 00:54:58.630
not clear what they're standing
on.

0d166754-16b6-42f6-bae1-96442a73587c-0
00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.550
What else?

fcac8c55-ea60-49c9-9b6c-be14501ed375-0
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:14.210

4d35ed1e-d06a-4ccd-83eb-bd51cabaa189-0
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:38.685
And the one one other curious is
that the caption, the Big

4d35ed1e-d06a-4ccd-83eb-bd51cabaa189-1

That the people.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:03.046
Surrounding it. People on, on
ladders, they're all they're all

5557f160-a1a5-4f59-b222-1105c5241ff9-1
00:56:03.046 --> 00:56:07.330

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:15.122
OK, so that was about 5 minutes.
We can move on to the next item.

b6e3afc3-f4b9-4385-8582-9822543f1d53-1
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:19.430
This is part of a graphic novel.
It has 2 pages.

eee55b94-8ec2-42e5-b9ed-d9b2de468446-0
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:32.668
#START_arrival_3 So there's a
boy selling newspapers. He's

eee55b94-8ec2-42e5-b9ed-d9b2de468446-1
00:56:32.668 --> 00:56:38.776
he's holding a placard and a
script that I don't recognize

eee55b94-8ec2-42e5-b9ed-d9b2de468446-2
00:56:38.776 --> 00:56:40.329

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:45.810
But he's certainly selling
selling news.

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:52.080
There's a woman holding a cat.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:55.960
Uh, talking to another woman.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:58.400
A man.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.710
Selling.

793909b2-a655-47bf-a0ea-f90d7315d8f0-0
00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:08.077
Looks like some kind of warm
food. But oddly enough, there's

793909b2-a655-47bf-a0ea-f90d7315d8f0-1
00:57:08.077 --> 00:57:13.823
a, I don't know why, there's a
hedgehog in a little basket next

793909b2-a655-47bf-a0ea-f90d7315d8f0-2
00:57:13.823 --> 00:57:19.211
to this hot food stand, and
there there's a man and a woman

793909b2-a655-47bf-a0ea-f90d7315d8f0-3
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:24.150
with huge eggs. They're putting
away another in a box.

3ecef8d7-5a1a-4b4a-9951-4022c09797b4-0
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:28.260
Unclear how all these pictures
are related.

4e7a0eb9-5617-4bca-829a-ed86f06757c8-0
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:35.511
There's a Barber shaving a
person, but it almost looks like

4e7a0eb9-5617-4bca-829a-ed86f06757c8-1
00:57:35.511 --> 00:57:41.079
the the person is a child. So
it's odd to be shaving a a

4e7a0eb9-5617-4bca-829a-ed86f06757c8-2
00:57:41.079 --> 00:57:42.739
child. There's a.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:49.850
A pair of musicians. Uh, one
playing

2879bcf8-c0c6-4a20-83ee-8572d82f238c-0
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:57.110
Violin with an odd looking bow
with nubs on it and.

77a2a1c5-648c-47f1-8df0-c943d9f71b56-0
00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:01.550
The other one playing a kind of
a combination.

4f0c4913-4821-4a1e-9ed9-9763fbc174ef-0
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.010
Tuba.

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.390
Concertina.

Uh.

bbf25c86-9096-4d7f-b3fa-c5ea5c69432d-0
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:14.960
Wo women.

11e0f5e9-5644-42df-b3fc-55652673f581-0
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.653
Looking at some, some some
writing of, of, of some kind,

11e0f5e9-5644-42df-b3fc-55652673f581-1
00:58:22.653 --> 00:58:28.527
sitting in a row underneath a, a
poster and a man with a suitcase

11e0f5e9-5644-42df-b3fc-55652673f581-2
00:58:28.527 --> 00:58:34.134
who looks the most normal of all
of these people may be gazing

11e0f5e9-5644-42df-b3fc-55652673f581-3
00:58:34.134 --> 00:58:39.029
around in some bewilderment
about what's all going on,

11e0f5e9-5644-42df-b3fc-55652673f581-4
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:44.636
because none of these pictures
seem to fit together in in a in

11e0f5e9-5644-42df-b3fc-55652673f581-5
00:58:44.636 --> 00:58:46.150
a meaningful way.

21f02144-20e5-41ea-8a4f-4eb4f9985c34-0
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:51.880
But now,

bc695602-c389-4d39-8d78-d88c4b555df4-0
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.130
The man looks at.

108fc916-c8a0-41c2-b2be-667cf9d37b65-0
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:05.456
a watch and and compares it to
an unusual looking clock on a

108fc916-c8a0-41c2-b2be-667cf9d37b65-1
00:59:05.456 --> 00:59:07.460
tower above him.

41b344a9-dafd-4aa2-83d1-eb8bda5cb7bb-0
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:10.710
He moves through this.

12910b01-7e15-41c2-a1a9-1adfef53585b-0
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:12.500
Scene.

dbd7810c-b98e-4d13-a50e-685ae17bc9ae-0
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.330
Past posters.

12186cde-96d6-48ea-bd2e-dada3fbc17e4-0
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:24.255
Uh and uh specs of of light
colored material descend from

12186cde-96d6-48ea-bd2e-dada3fbc17e4-1
00:59:24.255 --> 00:59:31.339
the sky, but it's not snow,
these things are are glowing and

12186cde-96d6-48ea-bd2e-dada3fbc17e4-2
00:59:31.339 --> 00:59:38.655
and a great wind comes and blows
off his hat which he collects

12186cde-96d6-48ea-bd2e-dada3fbc17e4-3
00:59:38.655 --> 00:59:44.810
and and he sees a a map with on
the floor with with.

c4ad876b-f1b0-4ca1-9361-088e7fbb0e80-0
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.680
Arrows pointing in various
directions.

65cc2830-9324-4fa2-b800-e1f37692a82e-0
00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:56.320
And he's also found a book,
unclear where the book came

65cc2830-9324-4fa2-b800-e1f37692a82e-1
00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.080
from. But.

da96fae1-a85b-4971-9923-56906a29e3b7-0
00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:06.455
He may be trying to make sense
of these arrows and directions

da96fae1-a85b-4971-9923-56906a29e3b7-1
01:00:06.455 --> 01:00:14.243
using the book, but now a man
approaches him, maybe a Middle

da96fae1-a85b-4971-9923-56906a29e3b7-2
01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:20.500
Eastern type man and he's, he's
he's asking him.

3b55ad6c-7892-4a50-889b-b569b938ef1c-0
01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:28.027
What's going on? And the the,
the, the the man explains his

3b55ad6c-7892-4a50-889b-b569b938ef1c-1
01:00:28.027 --> 01:00:30.340
predicaments and the.

cbdc4f5f-1ae6-43d6-bf58-982472b91f60-0
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.960
The the Middle Eastern guy.

7de5d4f9-2869-4969-b35f-2fa609a38a64-0
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.159
tries to understand. In fact,
the man draws the picture of a

7de5d4f9-2869-4969-b35f-2fa609a38a64-1
01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:46.312
bed and it looks like he's
looking for lodging. And the the

7de5d4f9-2869-4969-b35f-2fa609a38a64-2
01:00:46.312 --> 01:00:49.920
the other man says, ah yes, I
understand.

cbf615fe-dba5-4670-83e0-6378cd52bdba-0
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.880
And he leads him.

db06434d-6702-451c-80b4-557bae1493c2-0
01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:00.367
Towards a place where he can
presumably get lodging, but

db06434d-6702-451c-80b4-557bae1493c2-1
01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:02.880
strangely, this the the.

aa300d56-5e47-49e9-91b4-727f6c449b88-0
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:09.527
The Middle Eastern guy has has a
very strange animal in his

aa300d56-5e47-49e9-91b4-727f6c449b88-1
01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:13.130
backpack which the man is
looking at with.

00d8630f-70c0-410e-ad45-1b242691be4c-0
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:18.490
Great confusion and but
interest.#END_arrival_3

da30b8e2-4dd0-4a0f-8b23-580e070b26b3-0
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.202
Alright, so that was just part
of the story. So moving on,

da30b8e2-4dd0-4a0f-8b23-580e070b26b3-1
01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:26.930
we're going back to our complex
scene. 

6d9c27b1-02c2-4212-a19e-7d56feb906c2-0
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.080
Hmm, here we go.

667fa16b-9ee5-4cf9-a440-7a04f96cd4cc-0
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.300
Ohh #START_campsite OK so now we
have this is.

ee1efe92-5c01-476c-9db4-cd134c08b37f-0
01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:39.500
This is Waldo.

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:44.600
And, um, we have.

9830e929-767f-434a-8826-c132d03ca4e5-0
01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:47.660
A, a river.

f84767db-ce5a-4714-a209-36d3548e0d79-0
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:54.481
Cutting through a a set of of
fields, there's a, there's a

f84767db-ce5a-4714-a209-36d3548e0d79-1
01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:59.256
road which more or less
parallels the river in the upper

f84767db-ce5a-4714-a209-36d3548e0d79-2
01:01:59.256 --> 01:02:04.533
part, and there are there are
roads that approach the river in

f84767db-ce5a-4714-a209-36d3548e0d79-3
01:02:04.533 --> 01:02:09.642
the lower part. There are a
whole bunch of people camping in

f84767db-ce5a-4714-a209-36d3548e0d79-4
01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:10.480

Brightly coloured tents.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:21.167
Some of which are standard
tents, some of which are are

d794b340-7bb8-4241-8d19-82cbce499c0e-1
01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:26.437
more teepee style. There are
there are people fishing in the

d794b340-7bb8-4241-8d19-82cbce499c0e-2
01:02:26.437 --> 01:02:31.361
river, but there are also
mermaids floating about in the

d794b340-7bb8-4241-8d19-82cbce499c0e-3
01:02:31.361 --> 01:02:31.880

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:40.554
And and and boats of various
kinds. There's a bridge over the

dd931eea-409c-43ad-9ab9-a74203aaf710-1
01:02:40.554 --> 01:02:46.510
river, and the man in, it looks
like a a a punt.

b586823d-91ba-409a-a051-0c695c97db51-0
01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:52.181
With a long pole, but he has
banged his head under under

b586823d-91ba-409a-a051-0c695c97db51-1
01:02:52.181 --> 01:02:57.740
bridge while trying to get under
there in the river. There's also

b586823d-91ba-409a-a051-0c695c97db51-2
01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.110
a a shark coming coming down the
river.

A periscope of a.

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:08.039
Of a submarine with a bird
sitting on top of it and A and a

6603af82-0e17-4ba9-84a3-c9614a8d05eb-1
01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:09.600
duck floating down the river.

da15cd4d-92a3-4414-a574-6a3eb757a576-0
01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.530
There are.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:22.535
In one of the fields there are
there are bulls and somebody is

eed6b9a6-7fa9-4a9b-b241-f43d316fc2ae-1
01:03:22.535 --> 01:03:25.240
trying to to fight the the bull.

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:28.160
With a red cloth.

01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:31.560
There are.

81e2a491-6514-4c1b-b5f9-90bc8f986421-0
01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:37.435
There are hikers walking around
this this field, but they seem

81e2a491-6514-4c1b-b5f9-90bc8f986421-1
01:03:37.435 --> 01:03:42.459
to be suffering from exhaustion
and they're lying down. There's

81e2a491-6514-4c1b-b5f9-90bc8f986421-2
01:03:42.459 --> 01:03:47.012
also a man with a with a whip
who is presumably trying to

81e2a491-6514-4c1b-b5f9-90bc8f986421-3
01:03:47.012 --> 01:03:50.780
encourage them to keep going by
using the whip.

f79a6e91-c4f9-41ff-822e-5a6179575e0f-0
01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:58.096
On the other side of the river
there there's also camping, but

f79a6e91-c4f9-41ff-822e-5a6179575e0f-1
01:03:58.096 --> 01:04:03.047
it's done in more more kind of
recreational vehicle style

f79a6e91-c4f9-41ff-822e-5a6179575e0f-2
01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:03.730
camping.

1c46c7bb-32ec-45b1-8d4c-3f828a3c77d7-0
01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:12.120
And uh, so those people seem to
be more, more, more modern.

36414099-7e97-4717-9931-43be7049c568-0
01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.970
Although one of the campers on
the right hand side seems to be

36414099-7e97-4717-9931-43be7049c568-1
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:22.531
having a a a problem. There's a
looks like a fire in the camper

36414099-7e97-4717-9931-43be7049c568-2
01:04:22.531 --> 01:04:24.100
with smoke coming out.

7edc4da1-57c1-46ee-b223-767890efffbf-0
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.770
There are.

50fd4cea-dae5-45fc-9ae1-9f680eda029e-0
01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:38.600
Along the road, the parallels,
the river, there are people who

50fd4cea-dae5-45fc-9ae1-9f680eda029e-1
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.338
are who are running maybe in
kind of a race, and there are

50fd4cea-dae5-45fc-9ae1-9f680eda029e-2
01:04:42.338 --> 01:04:45.696

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.580
Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

ee0692df-d6a5-4713-9993-3ccacc89e4ca-0
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.860
Some of them are saluting.

6d9783a9-b9bc-4c18-bf45-9562b403c323-0
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.481
And some of them are sitting
around on the grass.

6d9783a9-b9bc-4c18-bf45-9562b403c323-1
01:05:21.481 --> 01:05:22.590

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.410
Alright, that was about 5
minutes.

86e70ff4-dd3f-4d31-ab9f-d7a927fafe82-0
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.393
And moving on, this one, this
one will be the last one we do.

86e70ff4-dd3f-4d31-ab9f-d7a927fafe82-1
01:05:32.393 --> 01:05:34.500
It's a five page graphic novel.

cfc6ca5e-debf-499f-9a5f-a6df0d7d4043-0
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:41.800
OK, alright.

510dde06-4d22-4015-b74b-49ea7b557d51-0
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.170
#START_arrival_1 So there's a
picture of a of a family.

4ac7c81c-8e2e-47d0-92eb-f32c47805218-0
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.030
Daughter.

1f7b594a-b385-47cf-98b5-d48c254e4fbd-0
01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:58.248
Uh, someone takes a picture from
the from the wall and and wraps

1f7b594a-b385-47cf-98b5-d48c254e4fbd-1
01:05:58.248 --> 01:06:03.784
it up in a in a cloth. So
they're they're taking the

1f7b594a-b385-47cf-98b5-d48c254e4fbd-2
01:06:03.784 --> 01:06:04.620
picture.

3f8afdeb-7646-472f-9f59-d84f21876713-0
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:06.200
With them.

307f6d3c-fe1f-471e-9f72-fb761b56abf3-0
01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.960
Somebody's hand is on somebody
else's.

1cd1dc85-8c76-4c76-ad58-0f44ffa2464a-0
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:17.840
And not quite sure if it's the
same person or not.

d0e6e61a-774d-4d2c-a8a9-7d06da771795-0
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:21.220
But I.

f718c979-6505-4305-a056-4632f670d016-0
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:28.858
Yeah, I think it's probably the
same person. So they've wrapped

f718c979-6505-4305-a056-4632f670d016-1
01:06:28.858 --> 01:06:33.770
up, packed up this. There are a
variety of other household

f718c979-6505-4305-a056-4632f670d016-2
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:34.270
items.

8a16c399-5d34-466c-aacb-8d7d181d13d2-0
01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.980
Origami picture of a of a bird,
a clock, a hat.

b9050bff-453a-4fac-805c-a85e47d00b71-0
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:49.859
A family picture uh written by a
child. A cracked Teapot Cup and

b9050bff-453a-4fac-805c-a85e47d00b71-1
01:06:49.859 --> 01:06:55.903
and this this family again. So
so now we see that it in fact

b9050bff-453a-4fac-805c-a85e47d00b71-2
01:06:55.903 --> 01:06:58.380
was two different people.

588d7f52-4d82-4ddb-b452-4e08b07fe168-0
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:08.579
uh, in in the first thing. And
the the the man and the woman

588d7f52-4d82-4ddb-b452-4e08b07fe168-1
01:07:08.579 --> 01:07:09.170
are.

c29bf7c7-fe24-405b-8187-3a0a62c99f08-0
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:15.040
Holding hands in a in a gesture
of of goodbye.

b99572ad-c745-47ea-8b7d-cace1f22943b-0
01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:23.445
Probably over this suitcase.
Somebody is is is going to go

b99572ad-c745-47ea-8b7d-cace1f22943b-1
01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:28.080
away. And they are, they are sad
about that.

8eefcc64-54bc-42f1-8ab1-2832172cb0fe-0
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:38.600
So the the daughter has been
asleep and she wakes up. She has

8eefcc64-54bc-42f1-8ab1-2832172cb0fe-1
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.610
her breakfast and she sees the
the the the suitcase.

b9d82149-d325-4f89-8eb2-e6dc44048ca9-0
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.900
Umm.

69d90834-21db-4b7a-98a2-17696b6fbd6f-0
01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.915
Lined up, but now they get
ready, they get ready to go out

69d90834-21db-4b7a-98a2-17696b6fbd6f-1
01:07:50.915 --> 01:07:55.819
and they leave their their
house. The father is carrying

69d90834-21db-4b7a-98a2-17696b6fbd6f-2
01:07:55.819 --> 01:07:57.970
the suitcase and the the.

22a79665-a6ec-43b7-a065-5a4ea1c98ed9-0
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:03.837
The girl is between the mother
and the father, and they they

22a79665-a6ec-43b7-a065-5a4ea1c98ed9-1
01:08:03.837 --> 01:08:08.962
leave their house, but there was
a mysterious shadow. It's like a

22a79665-a6ec-43b7-a065-5a4ea1c98ed9-2
01:08:08.962 --> 01:08:13.699
tail of a of a dragon which is
above them. So so that may be

22a79665-a6ec-43b7-a065-5a4ea1c98ed9-3
01:08:13.699 --> 01:08:18.048
just a symbolic representation
of a threat that they're

22a79665-a6ec-43b7-a065-5a4ea1c98ed9-4
01:08:18.048 --> 01:08:18.669
fleeing.

0283c3db-cc9c-4f46-95dd-4e58a4822d2d-0
01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200
So here's the.

95a82328-68e8-476d-b07e-15e5ddba5768-0
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.030
here's the girl.

4000948f-5ebd-4193-a7a9-cd43e7321d62-0
01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:28.640
She looks.

1ffe18bb-ba71-4527-89e7-d4a0b6f21872-0
01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.032
A little confused, maybe
concerned, but they get to the

1ffe18bb-ba71-4527-89e7-d4a0b6f21872-1
01:08:33.032 --> 01:08:34.070
railway station.

4504ab37-23cd-41d2-b7ff-efde48956c3b-0
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.750
And.

531fabd7-453d-4311-88fd-fe60cf5ea6f6-0
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.575
There the the father um shows
the origami bird he's been

531fabd7-453d-4311-88fd-fe60cf5ea6f6-1
01:08:39.575 --> 01:08:42.310
carrying underneath his hat, and
he gives that to the girl. 

457ebe39-210a-4726-bb50-f3ae6903a882-0
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.496
He's saying goodbye to the girl,
and he's saying goodbye to his

457ebe39-210a-4726-bb50-f3ae6903a882-1
01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:49.373
wife. She's very sad to see him
go. And they hold hands one last

457ebe39-210a-4726-bb50-f3ae6903a882-2
01:08:49.373 --> 01:08:53.189
time as he gets onto the train,
and then the train has to leave

457ebe39-210a-4726-bb50-f3ae6903a882-3
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:57.006
and the train steams away into
the distance with the man on it,

457ebe39-210a-4726-bb50-f3ae6903a882-4
01:08:57.006 --> 01:08:59.750
leaving the the wife and the
daughter behind.

f572fcf9-d2e7-42b5-8768-cd8a36b4eae1-0
01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:08.677
So now they're, uh, he's he's
distant. He's he's got wherever

f572fcf9-d2e7-42b5-8768-cd8a36b4eae1-1
01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:11.120
he's going, he's eating his.

75147ea6-0c4e-4315-8cc4-12def004049a-0
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:19.180
Dinner and he sees, he, he
reflects.

f7a75994-99c5-4d88-9b14-bec8a698a46b-0
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:24.881
Longingly on the family he's
left behind. And now we see that

f7a75994-99c5-4d88-9b14-bec8a698a46b-1
01:09:24.881 --> 01:09:30.051
in fact he's on a ship, he's on
a a big ship that is moving over

f7a75994-99c5-4d88-9b14-bec8a698a46b-2
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:34.426
the ocean and taking him far
away from his his family.

f7a75994-99c5-4d88-9b14-bec8a698a46b-3
01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:35.540
#END_arrival_1

7dcab489-2ef3-45f1-b4c8-f62fc88c46c1-0
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:41.600
OK. So that's all I had for
today.

5842d954-77fb-4b4a-94f9-614c8e9089a3-0
01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.680
