complex scenes.}

that you're describing the scene

medieval times.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.070
It says in the statement that
these are giants.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.884
Oh, as well as a a number of a
lot of other people that is in

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:07.630

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.474
There are homes. There are lots
of trees. There are there's a

There's a group of.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.253
People who are watching the
giants. There's some giants who

8d23718c-2615-4b02-bc58-522bccea6c95-1
00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:34.822

00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:40.768
smaller people in the right hand
corner. No, the right bottom,

male.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.429
Giant figures. Though the female
figures are actually wooden,

976687b5-87f9-4d11-8ce9-806b887d1a8f-1
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.220
they are not. They don't seem to
be real.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.233
I see lots of trees. It's on a
field on a flat field. The sun

ee5fca08-794c-4c48-9c37-01d802749769-1
00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:14.039
is in the far right top of the
page. It seems to be a sunny

ee5fca08-794c-4c48-9c37-01d802749769-2
00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:21.186
day. During the day there seems
to be some hills going towards

ee5fca08-794c-4c48-9c37-01d802749769-3
00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:24.589

00:02:34.723 --> 00:02:36.050
the page.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.160
Men with beards.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.560
The picture itself is very
colorful.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.636
#END_unfriendly_giants Lots of
movement in the in the pictures

5edeb104-033f-464b-91ca-8becda7d8897-1
00:02:55.636 --> 00:03:01.504
it seems to be as a season to be
probably in the spring or early

5edeb104-033f-464b-91ca-8becda7d8897-2
00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:06.740
summer because everybody seems
to be outside comfortable.

b2dfcfa2-6034-482f-9a8e-0cc7325d2beb-0
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.660
{OK, so that's about 3 1/2
minutes. That was good.}

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.141
{And then another type of
pictures that you will see are

00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:23.294
graphic novels. There are a
series of pictures that tell a

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:27.727
story. Again, just describe what
you see and what is happening

69bb0fce-b34c-457f-b543-cef07e962163-3
00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:31.669
and take between 10 and 15
minutes. Each story is has a

69bb0fce-b34c-457f-b543-cef07e962163-4
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.540
different length and the first
one contained 2 pages.}

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.010
{So I tell a story with this
picture. Yeah, OK.}

page I go from? It's the same

c50afd28-70bd-42f8-aa8f-2ad4cd4eea78-1
00:03:53.618 --> 00:03:58.606
layout as a print book, so you
go OK up to the right and OK OK

c50afd28-70bd-42f8-aa8f-2ad4cd4eea78-2
00:03:58.606 --> 00:03:59.240
got it.}

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.902
#START_arrival-3 So this is a
story about a time and place

372931ba-eca4-403f-bc14-18ce28138c57-1
00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:12.220
that is maybe in the late 1800s,
late 1800s, early.

75ede8d6-9a30-4ff1-ac8c-30e5ab937f54-0
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:21.050
Um, 1900s? And there's a boy who
is dishing out who is calling

75ede8d6-9a30-4ff1-ac8c-30e5ab937f54-1
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.440
out to say.

3e1eb11f-e85e-42c2-b2e4-062b51a8f373-0
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.826
A certain type of news that has
come out and people are reading

3e1eb11f-e85e-42c2-b2e4-062b51a8f373-1
00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:32.841
the newspaper looks as though
maybe there is an event that

3e1eb11f-e85e-42c2-b2e4-062b51a8f373-2
00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:35.360
took place in the in the urban
city.

dd36f48c-c3ba-4661-b164-dde6900eccf4-0
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.130
And people are also watching the
boy because he is announcing.

2fb3efcf-4672-4ffa-842c-086af1e7ff43-0
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.450
A special event or special act
that took place.

5c35ac94-04c6-4ef1-853b-8ac2712ec09e-0
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.734
The lady is carrying a cat with
an extremely large tail. Makes

5c35ac94-04c6-4ef1-853b-8ac2712ec09e-1
00:04:55.734 --> 00:05:00.610
me think that maybe this is part
fantasy, part real.

5a4c05b4-c2bd-4e42-8463-634315b46b1b-0
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.259
And she's having a talk with
another person, maybe talking

5a4c05b4-c2bd-4e42-8463-634315b46b1b-1
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.570
about the event that took place.

4ce4b4b6-797a-45c9-a25c-309fd0de462f-0
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.704
Ohh. Meanwhile there are scenes
of the the the city life that's

4ce4b4b6-797a-45c9-a25c-309fd0de462f-1
00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:22.498
taking place. There's a man who
is, oh, probably making a cup of

4ce4b4b6-797a-45c9-a25c-309fd0de462f-2
00:05:22.498 --> 00:05:26.420
coffee or tea and he's doing it
in a little

45deb628-a74f-4db6-a6dc-9aca4d72d168-0
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.850
Wheel cart. So he's a vendor.

148ca793-73fb-4b26-b9f7-439b3ce94988-0
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.170
Something hot.

972b5b0e-21f5-476c-8b0b-d146987bafbf-0
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.524
Um, with a little animal at the
front of the basket. Also, this

972b5b0e-21f5-476c-8b0b-d146987bafbf-1
00:05:39.524 --> 00:05:45.160
makes me think that this another
fantasy story because the animal

972b5b0e-21f5-476c-8b0b-d146987bafbf-2
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.197
is a very unusual type of
animal. Looks like a mix between

972b5b0e-21f5-476c-8b0b-d146987bafbf-3
00:05:50.197 --> 00:05:55.320
a squirrel and a lizard and a
little bit of a dinosaur. The

972b5b0e-21f5-476c-8b0b-d146987bafbf-4
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.590
man is busy making a cup of tea
or something hot.

3a0ecfb0-73b1-4921-8182-0f98398203aa-0
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.019
Meanwhile, there's also another
picture of a scenery that's of

3a0ecfb0-73b1-4921-8182-0f98398203aa-1
00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:12.924
the urban city life of two a man
and a woman carrying a very,

3a0ecfb0-73b1-4921-8182-0f98398203aa-2
00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:18.923
very big both, each carrying an
egg shaped item. It looks like

3a0ecfb0-73b1-4921-8182-0f98398203aa-3
00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:19.400
it's.

a2e573af-8c8e-4e41-abd9-a51b96df17cf-0
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.028
It's in a shape of an egg, but
very large, and they're placing

a2e573af-8c8e-4e41-abd9-a51b96df17cf-1
00:06:25.028 --> 00:06:26.500
it in a wooden box.

551fbd3a-1a46-4af7-a03f-b60ee8fb60b3-0
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.220
With.

425a6825-c784-42d5-a4db-0818c8975d3b-0
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.554
You know, it looks as though it
might be in a market that

425a6825-c784-42d5-a4db-0818c8975d3b-1
00:06:34.554 --> 00:06:38.685
they're about to either sell
their eggs or an egg like object

425a6825-c784-42d5-a4db-0818c8975d3b-2
00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:41.550
because there's other there's
another box.

f4037f5f-1d05-4ff2-9a9d-1e5193e90987-0
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.100
that is selling maybe like a
plant or another vegetable item

f4037f5f-1d05-4ff2-9a9d-1e5193e90987-1
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.610
That is unusual. It is difficult
to see it looks like.

654755c4-02a7-47c0-93fb-4c26a81a0ba4-0
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.350
The the the woman and the man
are probably in their 30s.

380b0eb1-a17a-4347-bc69-2f95947a171a-0
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.278
And then there's another scene
of of urban city life that's

380b0eb1-a17a-4347-bc69-2f95947a171a-1
00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:12.610
taking place, of a man shaving
a.

da8d1711-5db5-4b39-b16b-675f7a6a91d7-0
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.710
A man's beard.

41d8f856-50d3-45a5-8feb-d4048b5639ea-0
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.644
And outside amongst, on a little
on a high stool chair, there is

41d8f856-50d3-45a5-8feb-d4048b5639ea-1
00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:28.750
a boy, probably related to the
man who's getting his.

69859608-146d-4e8e-b56d-a1f35fe03eb5-0
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:37.390
face shaved standing, waiting
patiently while the the Barber.

a23d86a9-c5ed-4e74-be50-8b1cde238ab3-0
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.925
Is being very careful cleaning
the man's face as well as 12345

a23d86a9-c5ed-4e74-be50-8b1cde238ab3-1
00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:50.970
animal insect like creatures. It
looks like a combination of a

a23d86a9-c5ed-4e74-be50-8b1cde238ab3-2
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.728
snail and a crab that is roaming
around the foot of the the

a23d86a9-c5ed-4e74-be50-8b1cde238ab3-3
00:07:56.728 --> 00:08:02.870
Barber and the child. The child
looks about maybe 10 years old.

4327a589-3587-416c-b4ac-f94292fd17b4-0
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.330
Everybody seems to be wearing a
hat in this picture.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:15.080
Um, another scene is depicting
life in the city musicians.

13311a67-a3c0-4d7f-a701-087e9aee36c1-0
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.820
Two people, uh, they seem to be
playing an unusual instrument.

58afb149-da42-422b-8c47-2f30e6637ce2-0
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.790
Looks like an instrument that
is.

0241eb72-c342-4408-8c60-13707f4b3eb2-0
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:36.490
An accordion combined with a
large horn or a trumpet.

8ba4bb3d-5428-4299-bfe5-fb21da87d1c0-0
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.634
And then there is, and he is
sitting down reading notes and

8ba4bb3d-5428-4299-bfe5-fb21da87d1c0-1
00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:47.163
musical notes, and there's
another man in the background,

8ba4bb3d-5428-4299-bfe5-fb21da87d1c0-2
00:08:47.163 --> 00:08:50.130
further in the background,
playing a.

2d3c1555-355e-4f38-9694-aab07fef6313-0
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.670
Violin like instrument, but also
seems to be not unusual, not a

2d3c1555-355e-4f38-9694-aab07fef6313-1
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.940
normal what we call as normal
violin. It seems to have an

2d3c1555-355e-4f38-9694-aab07fef6313-2
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.749
additional.

69af235d-0460-4674-b29c-5514f59917ed-0
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:08.316
Parts to it that makes it rather
unusual. Both both these men are

69af235d-0460-4674-b29c-5514f59917ed-1
00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:13.520
probably in their 30s to 40s,
both also wearing hats and

69af235d-0460-4674-b29c-5514f59917ed-2
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.181
wearing a coat, which makes me
think that it is sometimes not

69af235d-0460-4674-b29c-5514f59917ed-3
00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:24.751
in the summertime where it's
very hot or any possibly spring

69af235d-0460-4674-b29c-5514f59917ed-4
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.030
or early fall.

174564c3-1fde-4015-87f6-fbd80980791d-0
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.550
And another picture is a group
of women.

38877ef0-5897-420d-ae9c-5eceffc89661-0
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.856
12345 women sitting against a
either a church or a wall that

38877ef0-5897-420d-ae9c-5eceffc89661-1
00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:44.880
has some writings that are hard
to.

8952f67d-3042-4f45-8967-a525bc276d21-0
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:52.684
Understand they seem to be one
woman at the forefront, seems to

8952f67d-3042-4f45-8967-a525bc276d21-1
00:09:52.684 --> 00:09:58.270
be reading either a Bible or
using hand gestures, another

8952f67d-3042-4f45-8967-a525bc276d21-2
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.953
woman and is knitting as she
listens, and there is another

8952f67d-3042-4f45-8967-a525bc276d21-3
00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:09.925
woman who is holding a rabbit on
her lap. They all seem to be

8952f67d-3042-4f45-8967-a525bc276d21-4
00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:15.897
paying attention to the woman
who is reading either a book or

8952f67d-3042-4f45-8967-a525bc276d21-5
00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:16.090
a.

a25f0480-b4a8-4e6a-a965-f41857cf3750-0
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.914
A Bible or religious item, and
there is a pot of hot water

a25f0480-b4a8-4e6a-a965-f41857cf3750-1
00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:28.099
steaming in the front of the
woman. And finally there is a

a25f0480-b4a8-4e6a-a965-f41857cf3750-2
00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:33.898
man who's trying to figure out a
way. He's trying to either cross

a25f0480-b4a8-4e6a-a965-f41857cf3750-3
00:10:33.898 --> 00:10:39.522
the street. It's a street scene.
He's carrying a suitcase. He's

a25f0480-b4a8-4e6a-a965-f41857cf3750-4
00:10:39.522 --> 00:10:41.280
looking to the side.

70f66bee-8ff0-42fa-a97f-785b069822ea-0
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.994
may be, a visitor to a town or a
city, they trying to figure out

70f66bee-8ff0-42fa-a97f-785b069822ea-1
00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:53.419
where to go. He's wearing a hat
and a coat and in the background

70f66bee-8ff0-42fa-a97f-785b069822ea-2
00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:58.344
there is a, a person wearing a
with a child trying to also

70f66bee-8ff0-42fa-a97f-785b069822ea-3
00:10:58.344 --> 00:11:03.602
looking either down on the on
the street looking at something.

70f66bee-8ff0-42fa-a97f-785b069822ea-4
00:11:03.602 --> 00:11:08.776
There seems to be a very faint
image of either another animal

70f66bee-8ff0-42fa-a97f-785b069822ea-5
00:11:08.776 --> 00:11:13.200
in the background for background
and then there's a.

eea99f7f-803f-4559-9f3f-a5f468907c62-0
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.740
A person who's just about to get
onto a bicycle.

0b2c7964-d24e-49a8-8ee1-d6092c70791f-0
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.280
Um.

8daff96d-d42c-4c24-b64e-353ca017b438-0
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:28.156
The man seems to be looking at a
time or trying to call some ohh

8daff96d-d42c-4c24-b64e-353ca017b438-1
00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:33.462
it is a time. It's a it's either
a what we call a clock, a pocket

8daff96d-d42c-4c24-b64e-353ca017b438-2
00:11:33.462 --> 00:11:38.206
clock. He's worried because
maybe the clock is not working

8daff96d-d42c-4c24-b64e-353ca017b438-3
00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:43.272
so he's looking around to see if
he can find another clock. He

8daff96d-d42c-4c24-b64e-353ca017b438-4
00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:48.176
did. He does see something in
the city center high above the

8daff96d-d42c-4c24-b64e-353ca017b438-5
00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:52.759
tower that looks like a clock.
There's an image of that.

c72b8ea0-33eb-4726-bc24-d0a7e03240d8-0
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.810
So he's walking down the streets
of of this.

81309787-e386-4dc2-a37c-55d0b4528e7e-0
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:04.043
City still trying to find his
way around. There's another

81309787-e386-4dc2-a37c-55d0b4528e7e-1
00:12:04.043 --> 00:12:09.676
scene of him walking past the
man who's on sitting on a

81309787-e386-4dc2-a37c-55d0b4528e7e-2
00:12:09.676 --> 00:12:12.090
sidewalk against a wall.

e0d26718-8870-49da-9031-8ef8bafef049-0
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.820
There's he's still trying to
walk past.

5c327e14-66b5-4458-8555-6d0cc3a90fef-0
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:21.897
Still looking, finding his way
around, all of a sudden he looks

5c327e14-66b5-4458-8555-6d0cc3a90fef-1
00:12:21.897 --> 00:12:26.686
up and he sees light, little
flecks of light that surrounds

5c327e14-66b5-4458-8555-6d0cc3a90fef-2
00:12:26.686 --> 00:12:31.634
him and he's trying to identify
what it is. He tries to touch

5c327e14-66b5-4458-8555-6d0cc3a90fef-3
00:12:31.634 --> 00:12:36.582
one of them and then all of a
sudden his hat is blown away so

5c327e14-66b5-4458-8555-6d0cc3a90fef-4
00:12:36.582 --> 00:12:41.531
he he picks it up. Meanwhile as
he picks up the hat on the on

5c327e14-66b5-4458-8555-6d0cc3a90fef-5
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:46.160
the sidewalk where where he is
standing there are arrows.

2b939476-7c30-4d96-9c01-ed2c660f0e2a-0
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.270
That are telling him directions
or.

f1ac3b71-6fa5-4922-be5b-9147c92c47d6-0
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.797
Clues to where he wants to go,
so he's looking at them more

f1ac3b71-6fa5-4922-be5b-9147c92c47d6-1
00:12:54.797 --> 00:12:55.390
carefully.

6da7a803-794f-4b44-b1e1-bcd28ebe7823-0
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.611
There are number of arrows on
the sidewalk and so they're

6da7a803-794f-4b44-b1e1-bcd28ebe7823-1
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:09.930
they're they're going up and
down. There are words or they

6da7a803-794f-4b44-b1e1-bcd28ebe7823-2
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:16.249
seem to be words and diagrams
and that'll infographs of of

6da7a803-794f-4b44-b1e1-bcd28ebe7823-3
00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:17.320
trying to.

abe6bf3e-8032-4c95-b878-72abc55ec26d-0
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.192
Give the person where he's
trying to go. Meanwhile, he's

abe6bf3e-8032-4c95-b878-72abc55ec26d-1
00:13:23.192 --> 00:13:28.623
he's trying to understand the
sidewalk. So he picks up a book

abe6bf3e-8032-4c95-b878-72abc55ec26d-2
00:13:28.623 --> 00:13:34.142
and he is bending. He puts his
suitcase to  his side, and he's

abe6bf3e-8032-4c95-b878-72abc55ec26d-3
00:13:34.142 --> 00:13:39.485
trying to read, using a book of
what the sidewalk is telling

abe6bf3e-8032-4c95-b878-72abc55ec26d-4
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:45.091
him. There's a close caption of
the details of his book as he's

abe6bf3e-8032-4c95-b878-72abc55ec26d-5
00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.420
reading it, and then he turns
around.

0940868f-429b-468b-aae4-5a4fc9478ce4-0
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:53.975
Because somebody is patting him
on his shoulder to get his

0940868f-429b-468b-aae4-5a4fc9478ce4-1
00:13:53.975 --> 00:13:57.230
attention, the man is telling
him.

dd657afc-bc11-4605-af59-c89b410755d1-0
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.751
Maybe let me help you or you
lost. He is wearing a white robe

dd657afc-bc11-4605-af59-c89b410755d1-1
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:04.680
with a hat.

4dd16659-ee09-459d-a638-110102b7f1dd-0
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:12.028
And so the man in who's lost is
they're having a dialogue, he's

4dd16659-ee09-459d-a638-110102b7f1dd-1
00:14:12.028 --> 00:14:17.865
trying to figure out a way to
get to a location, and there are

4dd16659-ee09-459d-a638-110102b7f1dd-2
00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:23.330
two scenes of of the dialogue
taking place between the two

4dd16659-ee09-459d-a638-110102b7f1dd-3
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:28.796
men. And then the man who is
searching for direction grabs

4dd16659-ee09-459d-a638-110102b7f1dd-4
00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:34.632
his book and starts to write in
his notebook where he's trying

4dd16659-ee09-459d-a638-110102b7f1dd-5
00:14:34.632 --> 00:14:36.300
to go and when he.

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-0
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.880
Shows the man, he he he draws
the picture of a bed and a

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-1
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.273
window and he points to the
direction. He points to the

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-2
00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:50.136
picture of the man says, oh, I
may know where you were trying

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-3
00:14:50.136 --> 00:14:54.921
to go. He points to and say, let
me show you the way, let me

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-4
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:59.705
guide you the way. And so the
man it starts to walk in front

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-5
00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:03.549
of the the the visitor.
Meanwhile the visitor is

eeeabd78-f75a-4888-9ef1-75b09b98f6ee-6
00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:06.530
noticing that the man who is
guiding.

3db38207-6a80-45a0-9b2e-13eec2a2ab76-0
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:12.914
#END_arrival-3 Has the another
unusual animal creature as he's

3db38207-6a80-45a0-9b2e-13eec2a2ab76-1
00:15:12.914 --> 00:15:17.740
carrying the creature in the
back of his basket.

d185b073-b95e-496d-8bad-d7a284a10359-0
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.104
{OK. Sorry. Can I just quick,
quickly close the door? Sorry,

d185b073-b95e-496d-8bad-d7a284a10359-1
00:15:25.104 --> 00:15:25.490
yeah.}

c8e04b85-5159-44e3-98ac-c449a3cde33b-0
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.609
{Sorry, my dog just came into
the room, so OK. And how long

c8e04b85-5159-44e3-98ac-c449a3cde33b-1
00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:42.220
was that? Was that two not in
long enough?}

f18fd09f-f99d-4dd0-9c31-0eae8c151ba0-0
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.110
{So OK.

e92c493c-fd35-4389-91bc-e1541e1a64b1-0
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.243
Oh, and I should have said I was
going to just going to say this

e92c493c-fd35-4389-91bc-e1541e1a64b1-1
00:15:51.243 --> 00:15:54.580

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:00.528
{So that was a graphic novel
that you saw and OK, going back

ecd2ced1-bb75-45e5-b28b-a689c0a4bd05-1
00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:01.980
to a complex scene.}

9a4550af-f41c-4c74-a208-567e7fa0e4f6-0
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:14.565
{OK, just describe it again.
Yes. OK, } #START_by_the_lake so

9a4550af-f41c-4c74-a208-567e7fa0e4f6-1
00:16:14.565 --> 00:16:22.590
this is a picture of a, once
again, lots of people at a lake.

7a4e7f39-1b74-4f0f-8c14-63e9b8204a91-0
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.830
This must be a summer time. It's
a very visual picture.

d7dc0869-d0c9-42f1-89d0-f550d402a7b3-0
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:35.806
In their sailboats and yachts
and a dragon boat race, as well

d7dc0869-d0c9-42f1-89d0-f550d402a7b3-1
00:16:35.806 --> 00:16:41.368
as paddle boaters, speed
boaters, canoers, kayakers,

d7dc0869-d0c9-42f1-89d0-f550d402a7b3-2
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:48.190
people jumping off a floater in
the middle of the lake they seem

d7dc0869-d0c9-42f1-89d0-f550d402a7b3-3
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:54.906
to be having. Everybody seems to
be having a very good time. It

d7dc0869-d0c9-42f1-89d0-f550d402a7b3-4
00:16:54.906 --> 00:16:58.789
must be sometime in the summer
time.

f4a8d156-ed6c-41c8-a217-f839c12aebcd-0
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.664
That there are people around the
lake by this by a sand beach.

f4a8d156-ed6c-41c8-a217-f839c12aebcd-1
00:17:04.664 --> 00:17:07.960
Also building a castle, a Big
castle.

53414ef1-d70c-4b75-81d2-0ce74d3e84ab-0
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.203
There are children as well as
young people as well as elderly

53414ef1-d70c-4b75-81d2-0ce74d3e84ab-1
00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:19.099
people, but not as much elderly
people, mostly families and and

53414ef1-d70c-4b75-81d2-0ce74d3e84ab-2
00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:23.230
young people having a good time.
I see some cyclists.

59b05c5b-de1b-48c5-aff7-f3c21c020b4a-0
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:29.951
I see people also doing the
parasailing in the back, also

59b05c5b-de1b-48c5-aff7-f3c21c020b4a-1
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:32.160
somebody. It's like a.

d5e5278d-d6b8-45ec-ad0e-17587d11c0b7-0
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.727
boat pulling a group of people
doing a pyramid on on top of

d5e5278d-d6b8-45ec-ad0e-17587d11c0b7-1
00:17:38.727 --> 00:17:44.830
each other. It looks like a show
there. Volleyball players by the

d5e5278d-d6b8-45ec-ad0e-17587d11c0b7-2
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.192
beach as well. Some people
listening to music and the man

d5e5278d-d6b8-45ec-ad0e-17587d11c0b7-3
00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:55.740
is playing a guitar by a boat
that's on the sand. There's a

d5e5278d-d6b8-45ec-ad0e-17587d11c0b7-4
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:01.288
kite that's flowing in the
middle of the page, Umm, as well

d5e5278d-d6b8-45ec-ad0e-17587d11c0b7-5
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.229
as people lying down.

2ebf4b0f-8f90-4257-8272-0896c6530358-0
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.600
Oh, there's a group of young
people playing soccer.

2af4a418-fd8d-4ace-9681-e15f692b0f43-0
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.836
Children on the backs of of dads
or and people having

2af4a418-fd8d-4ace-9681-e15f692b0f43-1
00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:16.340
conversations with each other.

79feb99a-c655-4f33-bdc4-f95e1a2f052b-0
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.496
There's a there's a house,
there's a couple of buildings in

79feb99a-c655-4f33-bdc4-f95e1a2f052b-1
00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:26.530
the background.

92715b96-3209-4122-9847-bcf3981eb21b-0
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.270
It looks like they're having a
BBQ outside as well as looking

92715b96-3209-4122-9847-bcf3981eb21b-1
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.360
at what's going on in the in the
lake.

71067c9f-e8a8-4dda-9060-b001fc331381-0
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.820
The homes are mostly.

25a1d48e-3b35-4520-be5f-7cb7a499de0d-0
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.470
Is a castle like.

b62850d0-1469-4030-a87d-9c1488bbfca3-0
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:51.301
Building in the back, they seem
to be maybe hotels. There's like

b62850d0-1469-4030-a87d-9c1488bbfca3-1
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:55.520
a a group of women doing yoga or
handstand.

3d356337-a295-4609-9c85-6c263ce6cc43-0
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.760
Each ball playing.

c2a8f5f5-5bb1-4766-9448-e4c77f959f39-0
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:08.043
It's on petals, floaters. It's a
scene that is, for the most

c2a8f5f5-5bb1-4766-9448-e4c77f959f39-1
00:19:08.043 --> 00:19:12.060
part, very cheerful and happy
and people.

bb2285cf-8540-42bd-873f-3f55aea20332-0
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.985
#END_by_the_lake Watching people
watching taking place. {Alright,

bb2285cf-8540-42bd-873f-3f55aea20332-1
00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:22.600
yeah, OK good. So that was about
5-4 minutes.}

e5e8de85-0d72-4fab-acad-6f6d96fa2912-0
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.348
{So we're going back to
describing graphic novels. This

one in particular has around 11
pages. OK, we were aiming

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.080
#START_flowerman This is a
scene.

c7df3322-f1cd-43d4-8577-84548622726e-0
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:55.820
That is taking place at the edge
of a a town.

7611f54c-6d60-4af6-84d8-9e071217e0b8-0
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.080
There is a.

a4cc994c-5f67-47d6-bc31-ccffcdddd614-0
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.880
A river that seems to be drying
up.

2a811c37-f77f-4a35-afc1-c354d8e8ef20-0
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:09.740
And uh, the story seems to be
taking place. Um.

567a9a06-75af-452e-acb2-3da5f6ae5609-0
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.830
Maybe at the end of the day.

76d018b7-9321-453d-be64-3594ed130365-0
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.570
Or early.

968ede2c-d798-4c5e-8d75-5a6161d953cb-0
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.804
Good evening as the colours are
mostly in black and white except

968ede2c-d798-4c5e-8d75-5a6161d953cb-1
00:20:24.804 --> 00:20:28.610
for a lone person crossing a
bridge.

46a24d29-c44b-4595-b2a0-a46958f2f08a-0
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:35.645
Yeah, it must be towards the end
of the day, early evening,

46a24d29-c44b-4595-b2a0-a46958f2f08a-1
00:20:35.645 --> 00:20:41.562
because the lights on the the
bridge are illuminated and so as

46a24d29-c44b-4595-b2a0-a46958f2f08a-2
00:20:41.562 --> 00:20:47.291
a result, the person on the
bridge, she was looking into the

46a24d29-c44b-4595-b2a0-a46958f2f08a-3
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:53.489
river, the empty river. It looks
as though it's an elderly person

46a24d29-c44b-4595-b2a0-a46958f2f08a-4
00:20:53.489 --> 00:20:59.406
who is wearing a greenish coat
and a hat, walking her dog, his

46a24d29-c44b-4595-b2a0-a46958f2f08a-5
00:20:59.406 --> 00:21:00.439
dog or cat.

34b36515-adeb-4330-94c6-0e2bd904ea99-0
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.690
Some kind of animal is trying to
cross over the bridge to get to.

329e34b5-ac26-4f01-b9b6-279d05119640-0
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:14.063
The town area that has more
buildings and a bait shop which

329e34b5-ac26-4f01-b9b6-279d05119640-1
00:21:14.063 --> 00:21:15.150
I guess is.

84e77761-b1cb-4724-bc7f-3fbce4a4baf0-0
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.960
As well as a bar and a gas
station, there is a.

3c4a0fb7-9b9f-4eff-995c-3b8ddb17e401-0
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.070
Ferris wheel in the back and
their circus like tent which?

bd9ffeaa-002d-42db-b24f-ec6d9010cc9a-0
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.920
Looks like it's not moving
because it's the end of the day.

03e0a666-a0b7-4659-9efd-70b26488ce35-0
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.140
It must be at a time where
people are using their chimney

03e0a666-a0b7-4659-9efd-70b26488ce35-1
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.661
and the fireplace to make their
house warm, so it must be

03e0a666-a0b7-4659-9efd-70b26488ce35-2
00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:51.372
sometime in early, late fall,
early winter. Umm, other than

03e0a666-a0b7-4659-9efd-70b26488ce35-3
00:21:51.372 --> 00:21:56.987
the old person crossing the
bridge, there's another person

03e0a666-a0b7-4659-9efd-70b26488ce35-4
00:21:56.987 --> 00:22:02.318
on the either waiting for
somebody at the corner of the

03e0a666-a0b7-4659-9efd-70b26488ce35-5
00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:03.270
bait shop.

61bc4b7c-dbe6-4b6f-baaf-302c629fd22a-0
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:10.054
Or just killing time. There
seems to be a an abandoned car

61bc4b7c-dbe6-4b6f-baaf-302c629fd22a-1
00:22:10.054 --> 00:22:14.800
that seems to have falling into
the dried up river.

05aacfd2-becf-4347-bbb1-a23e13f1a943-0
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:23.241
Looks like it's been there a
long time. There is a truck in

05aacfd2-becf-4347-bbb1-a23e13f1a943-1
00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:30.215
front of the bait shop that
seems to be parked there. It's

05aacfd2-becf-4347-bbb1-a23e13f1a943-2
00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:37.897
an old style truck that is used
to carry items larger items with

05aacfd2-becf-4347-bbb1-a23e13f1a943-3
00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:42.980
the 222 seated or three seated
truck. Ohh.

aa081583-2e24-419a-9f1a-f9296f98ea10-0
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:50.004
In the background there seems to
be a chimney. Um, I don't know

aa081583-2e24-419a-9f1a-f9296f98ea10-1
00:22:50.004 --> 00:22:53.100
if it's a chimney or a factory,
but.

718a5a65-5e6a-497a-ac2e-3f7ab0ca333e-0
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.220
It seems to be.

772b0f90-2b60-43cf-8f56-002ecd3d2847-0
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.230
Sometime.

e707f6b5-0582-4781-966b-6749ee35bd1d-0
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.328
Uh, hard to tell whether it's
not. It's not a current

e707f6b5-0582-4781-966b-6749ee35bd1d-1
00:23:05.328 --> 00:23:10.107
depiction, and hard to tell
whether it's another fantasy

e707f6b5-0582-4781-966b-6749ee35bd1d-2
00:23:10.107 --> 00:23:11.030
like story.

c0687ef8-bead-4d30-83aa-c831839a97a1-0
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.241
The old person who is carrying
an umbrella and a bag with an

c0687ef8-bead-4d30-83aa-c831839a97a1-1
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:24.310
animal by

b9d54575-9623-4d3c-89aa-dddfa4630df2-0
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:30.600
His or her side is wearing a
scarf and a hat, a blue hat.

3b8b57bd-f223-4300-9f06-f673d484783a-0
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:37.811
And now he is walking through
more of the city, more of the

3b8b57bd-f223-4300-9f06-f673d484783a-1
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:44.442
town. He's coming to a corner
and he could either turn left,

3b8b57bd-f223-4300-9f06-f673d484783a-2
00:23:44.442 --> 00:23:47.160
which would direct him to

850dba97-e39b-4753-9ab5-a7c8b6b906e5-0
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.959
A building that says Cafe. It
could be a hotel or a

850dba97-e39b-4753-9ab5-a7c8b6b906e5-1
00:23:54.959 --> 00:24:01.646
restaurant. You see pictures of
people who are maybe like in two

850dba97-e39b-4753-9ab5-a7c8b6b906e5-2
00:24:01.646 --> 00:24:07.922
or four separate rooms. One room
there's a picture of a of a

850dba97-e39b-4753-9ab5-a7c8b6b906e5-3
00:24:07.922 --> 00:24:14.197
couple having a discussion or
singing or having some kind of

850dba97-e39b-4753-9ab5-a7c8b6b906e5-4
00:24:14.197 --> 00:24:17.490
an interaction. There's another.

7b5cd72d-c015-443b-876b-446821ecef41-0
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:25.129
up the upper level, this is a
building with two three story

7b5cd72d-c015-443b-876b-446821ecef41-1
00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:26.140
building.

7beb3967-b595-4b5b-93ca-578f8d1d2f4a-0
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.570
Top level.

50e5274d-cc67-41ea-b9f0-16fa21bf0433-0
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.250
I think there's a two people.

2e316123-f5fb-419b-83a0-71bf80786c0b-0
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.607
I can't tell if it's like a
scientist doing some experiment

2e316123-f5fb-419b-83a0-71bf80786c0b-1
00:24:37.607 --> 00:24:38.320
or cooking.

ce696e8a-f178-4f72-8d24-fc4e2a88de1e-0
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:45.550
And then they're right next door
on the third level. There's a

ce696e8a-f178-4f72-8d24-fc4e2a88de1e-1
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.080
man, also in either in his
bathroom.

3f5ea5eb-59f0-4c2a-8e8a-26d31655e4cb-0
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.532
The picture of another person.
These are all windows that are

3f5ea5eb-59f0-4c2a-8e8a-26d31655e4cb-1
00:24:55.532 --> 00:24:55.950
open.

79673286-3f03-4054-a6c7-f1b988b35db6-0
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:07.718
And one more room that has a
woman sitting either looking at

79673286-3f03-4054-a6c7-f1b988b35db6-1
00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:10.980
a TV or a an animal.

7693d3bd-cfbc-416a-a07f-53e133da65a3-0
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.760
And at the bottom of the
entrance to this cafe building,

7693d3bd-cfbc-416a-a07f-53e133da65a3-1
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.940
there is a man sitting, also
waiting.

7320d424-eb2f-4b05-88f3-5f29aca28aa7-0
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:27.827
Once again, it looks as though
it's at the early stage of early

7320d424-eb2f-4b05-88f3-5f29aca28aa7-1
00:25:27.827 --> 00:25:32.863
part of the evening, so the
street lights are helping

7320d424-eb2f-4b05-88f3-5f29aca28aa7-2
00:25:32.863 --> 00:25:37.805
illuminate the, the, the
cobblestones Street there's

7320d424-eb2f-4b05-88f3-5f29aca28aa7-3
00:25:37.805 --> 00:25:43.773
definitely a lot of other people
who are in other structures of

7320d424-eb2f-4b05-88f3-5f29aca28aa7-4
00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:47.690
the, of the, of this corner of
this town.

35c5e734-4c11-4974-a996-09a3624f6973-0
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:55.260
The windows are open, are
visible um.

9ceb2a8f-017c-4929-a18a-229b7ebdcc40-0
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.290
Uh, there's another.

974dac59-36cf-48a5-9e5d-8b46078ac1ee-0
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:06.060
Building that seems to be closer
to the man to the to the left of

974dac59-36cf-48a5-9e5d-8b46078ac1ee-1
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:11.328
him. It's it doesn't show
people. Other than at the very

974dac59-36cf-48a5-9e5d-8b46078ac1ee-2
00:26:11.328 --> 00:26:16.320
top of the rooftop room there is
a a man looking out.

4bb1994b-1862-48a7-97d9-9406be8da84e-0
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.601
But the other two rooms, even
though we see that there are

4bb1994b-1862-48a7-97d9-9406be8da84e-1
00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:24.990
there are people living there,
we cannot see people.

a0403fa0-c43d-4607-a740-3be044132f15-0
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:32.080
And to the side of the building
there's a man 2 two men.

3070523d-8cd7-4089-8d44-596bf4345437-0
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.876
one is just wearing a sleeveless
shirt and another person wearing

3070523d-8cd7-4089-8d44-596bf4345437-1
00:26:38.876 --> 00:26:43.424
a jacket makes me think that
there are just neighbors or

3070523d-8cd7-4089-8d44-596bf4345437-2
00:26:43.424 --> 00:26:45.339
somebody who's just out.

2d6b5e4e-1417-40f2-96c0-b0a9e7d67978-0
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:52.660
Um, close by to their home
having a talk. One man seems to

2d6b5e4e-1417-40f2-96c0-b0a9e7d67978-1
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:59.419
be fairly would say angry, but
he's not happy and they seem to

2d6b5e4e-1417-40f2-96c0-b0a9e7d67978-2
00:26:59.419 --> 00:27:00.600
be looking.

c8961397-2f39-4e36-9812-32d81848a5e7-0
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.760
Or having a discussion about.

298d6d5b-84ab-428b-8fad-ddf56cfb21c1-0
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.830
And with just the two of them.

ab98caef-872f-4b83-b8eb-be449b6a99fa-0
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.520
And there is another.

467d84ea-7a1b-43d7-bb6a-06f387a3dade-0
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.966
Man or a boy who is in another
building out in the terrace with

467d84ea-7a1b-43d7-bb6a-06f387a3dade-1
00:27:19.966 --> 00:27:26.955
a cat and he looks sad,
concerned, worried, unsure of of

467d84ea-7a1b-43d7-bb6a-06f387a3dade-2
00:27:26.955 --> 00:27:34.556
of what to do. He does not look
happy and he is behind closed

467d84ea-7a1b-43d7-bb6a-06f387a3dade-3
00:27:34.556 --> 00:27:35.660
doors OK.

ae8fafdc-a85a-413d-a5d7-86ac502fb1a2-0
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:48.076
The man is continuing to walk on
and in the in this town and he

ae8fafdc-a85a-413d-a5d7-86ac502fb1a2-1
00:27:48.076 --> 00:27:54.923
is currently standing in front
of the building. A very old

ae8fafdc-a85a-413d-a5d7-86ac502fb1a2-2
00:27:54.923 --> 00:28:01.770
message actually. It's a one
story home that says for sale

ae8fafdc-a85a-413d-a5d7-86ac502fb1a2-3
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:06.180
and this house is looking
unattended.

01fb49c5-f3b5-4972-bdb8-594f26a34df8-0
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.470
It has a small little entrance
area with.

2b21861b-6b01-4433-8ea0-ef42cbbc6768-0
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.962
With the lawn in the front, that
looks as though it has not been

2b21861b-6b01-4433-8ea0-ef42cbbc6768-1
00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:20.789
occupied, or it looks it as it
hasn't been cared for for some

2b21861b-6b01-4433-8ea0-ef42cbbc6768-2
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:23.320
time and he is standing under
the light.

06495d15-5b20-4c6d-a06f-48a6b4c8c83b-0
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.950
Of the.

e622e54a-05e8-47db-8ece-96cbf0032cb9-0
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.708
Lamp, city lamp. And so he is
still the only one that has our

e622e54a-05e8-47db-8ece-96cbf0032cb9-1
00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:33.310
is depicted in color.

c415c53f-d8dd-4c57-910d-50f85a18aa4b-0
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:41.199
The rest of the picture there
are other scenes of life of this

c415c53f-d8dd-4c57-910d-50f85a18aa4b-1
00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:43.600
town that he is visiting.

8c08330c-608f-412b-9215-9c99731b5d6f-0
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:53.334
There are 1234567 buildings on
this. On this two page there is

8c08330c-608f-412b-9215-9c99731b5d6f-1
00:28:53.334 --> 00:29:00.900
in the buildings there is a man
who is either taking a bath.

0b17f20e-4027-4075-9873-8e782cfa4ff4-0
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.260
Or is cooling off because
there's a fan in front of him.

2f8ecb89-a251-4e9a-a074-17bb6bf98f89-0
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.987
He is very visible. There's a
woman who seems to be in next

2f8ecb89-a251-4e9a-a074-17bb6bf98f89-1
00:29:13.987 --> 00:29:18.010
door in another room, facing a
mirror.

0dac5630-b8ad-4db9-bb57-f06eef770e73-0
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.050
And she is with a group of
people.

aa095cca-1486-467a-8988-c4f41ce85687-0
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.254
And at the lower level of this
building, there is a woman who

aa095cca-1486-467a-8988-c4f41ce85687-1
00:29:27.254 --> 00:29:31.069
is with a child that seems to be
shouting or saying something

aa095cca-1486-467a-8988-c4f41ce85687-2
00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:33.530
that she is looking outside the
window.

0442e8dc-bbdb-4256-a40b-4f45b7987522-0
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.836
And in the next building there
is a woman who is about to enter

0442e8dc-bbdb-4256-a40b-4f45b7987522-1
00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:45.207
into a smaller building, 2 story
building, where on the higher

0442e8dc-bbdb-4256-a40b-4f45b7987522-2
00:29:45.207 --> 00:29:49.470
level there is a an artist and
starting to paint.

668e22ae-0ecc-4bfa-a4ce-fb7ab25e75ed-0
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.500
Meeting.

2df29566-18d7-4611-81fb-97486125a08c-0
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.990
Umm.

80f91cb0-fd0d-4aa2-8cae-6a0f81e1d9ec-0
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.630
In the town.

c9a5d495-f263-40fb-8cee-1aaab8633fdd-0
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:02.285
Outside there is a man sitting
close to a a fountain on the

c9a5d495-f263-40fb-8cee-1aaab8633fdd-1
00:30:02.285 --> 00:30:07.509
side of the the fountain with
the fountain seems to be empty.

c9a5d495-f263-40fb-8cee-1aaab8633fdd-2
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:12.480
Both he and the little boy who's
sitting next to him have.

6b827473-2850-4121-965b-74afe4ec3e05-0
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.271
Their hands on their face,
looking worried or sad or

6b827473-2850-4121-965b-74afe4ec3e05-1
00:30:18.271 --> 00:30:23.812
concerned, or they do not seem
to look happy. Meanwhile,

6b827473-2850-4121-965b-74afe4ec3e05-2
00:30:23.812 --> 00:30:29.450
towards the end, towards the
other parts of the the town,

6b827473-2850-4121-965b-74afe4ec3e05-3
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:35.768
there are people standing by the
building, having a talk, having

6b827473-2850-4121-965b-74afe4ec3e05-4
00:30:35.768 --> 00:30:41.892
a discussion. There's a little
boy with a man who is trying to

6b827473-2850-4121-965b-74afe4ec3e05-5
00:30:41.892 --> 00:30:42.670
work at.

038fff66-cad3-47a3-8eec-ece139dc335f-0
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:48.200
Getting the water, the city
water pump working.

ee0ea7f2-389b-4801-a412-c5a1e1d721a6-0
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.932
And in that building there are
more people either looking

ee0ea7f2-389b-4801-a412-c5a1e1d721a6-1
00:30:54.932 --> 00:31:00.109
outside, looking at what's going
on in the town square, as well

ee0ea7f2-389b-4801-a412-c5a1e1d721a6-2
00:31:00.109 --> 00:31:03.750
as people who are just sitting
and relaxing.

72c78f00-d579-4b39-b2a6-ca995779fe04-0
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.560
Here's a picture of the same
area.

9782d12f-48b2-4f81-8f6a-a5a3df25e0fa-0
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:18.135
At the end looks like it's
during the day because the

9782d12f-48b2-4f81-8f6a-a5a3df25e0fa-1
00:31:18.135 --> 00:31:23.274
street lights are not on. Once
again, the picture is the paint

9782d12f-48b2-4f81-8f6a-a5a3df25e0fa-2
00:31:23.274 --> 00:31:27.680
the the page is more or less
black and white or Gray.

993a94f4-d004-42fc-93d8-befbe2937ca4-0
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:35.449
Very very detailed. The only
picture or area that has color

993a94f4-d004-42fc-93d8-befbe2937ca4-1
00:31:35.449 --> 00:31:42.021
is the house that the the man
was looking at that was for sale

993a94f4-d004-42fc-93d8-befbe2937ca4-2
00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:47.967
for for sale sign. He looks to
be have bought the house.

993a94f4-d004-42fc-93d8-befbe2937ca4-3
00:31:47.967 --> 00:31:49.950
{Excuse me, sorry.}

dc82265b-abea-4b26-aeef-bf1d4a786b95-0
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:56.410
{Sorry.}

12015400-9977-4822-9cbd-20fa6ef3c0d7-0
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.602
So the man is actually outside
the house is looking much more

12015400-9977-4822-9cbd-20fa6ef3c0d7-1
00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:06.590
fixed up.

46a7ad67-f87a-48a9-95d9-752cdcb32337-0
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.615
It's a one story house. The for
sale sign is no longer up. He

46a7ad67-f87a-48a9-95d9-752cdcb32337-1
00:32:12.615 --> 00:32:17.225
has been working in the garden
and trimming the lawn because

46a7ad67-f87a-48a9-95d9-752cdcb32337-2
00:32:17.225 --> 00:32:19.190
there is a lawn mower out.

b96a05c3-4100-4f67-9890-0a608c5837ad-0
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:26.377
People are looking at his house
as he's making the house look

b96a05c3-4100-4f67-9890-0a608c5837ad-1
00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:31.784
more clean and cared for and
beautiful. He is actually on a

b96a05c3-4100-4f67-9890-0a608c5837ad-2
00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:36.110
ladder himself, working on one
of the shutters.

d350491c-9dae-4e49-8b05-599b5772286a-0
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:42.121
Um, and there is a tree that
seems to be blooming in the

d350491c-9dae-4e49-8b05-599b5772286a-1
00:32:42.121 --> 00:32:48.143
background next to the the small
one unit house, and there it has

d350491c-9dae-4e49-8b05-599b5772286a-2
00:32:48.143 --> 00:32:53.983
flower white flowers and orange
leaves as well as green leaves.

d350491c-9dae-4e49-8b05-599b5772286a-3
00:32:53.983 --> 00:32:59.458
The rest of this scene of the
town, it's active. People are

d350491c-9dae-4e49-8b05-599b5772286a-4
00:32:59.458 --> 00:33:04.751
out and about going places.
There's a man in the scooter,

d350491c-9dae-4e49-8b05-599b5772286a-5
00:33:04.751 --> 00:33:06.850
there's a man that has.

8f04b82d-7468-45e6-a4cd-5fa58d824be1-0
00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:12.233
A broken foot or broken leg on a
wheelchair. I don't know if it's

8f04b82d-7468-45e6-a4cd-5fa58d824be1-1
00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:16.886
the artist because he's wearing
the cap, but he's heading

8f04b82d-7468-45e6-a4cd-5fa58d824be1-2
00:33:16.886 --> 00:33:18.410
towards the bridge.

0be8e332-23ad-4f8a-9578-9bc37fb22520-0
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:25.367
There's a girl that's looking at
the the man in the wheelchair

0be8e332-23ad-4f8a-9578-9bc37fb22520-1
00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:30.645
and the woman who's dressed up
to go trying to see if the girl

0be8e332-23ad-4f8a-9578-9bc37fb22520-2
00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:34.750
who is with her would come pay
attention to her.

68ea71e1-bfa6-4b6c-8a51-cd1522453142-0
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.634
There's another there's a group

68ea71e1-bfa6-4b6c-8a51-cd1522453142-1
00:33:41.634 --> 00:33:46.439
who's also looking at the house
that's being transformed by the

68ea71e1-bfa6-4b6c-8a51-cd1522453142-2
00:33:46.439 --> 00:33:47.040
old man.

b71ff574-dcb0-4fbc-9a5e-2cb4cb2a7a87-0
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.170
As well as.

ec6ce8f4-7f43-43c1-b143-0486f2b209bf-0
00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:00.206
Two boys playing kickball near
the square town square fountain,

ec6ce8f4-7f43-43c1-b143-0486f2b209bf-1
00:34:00.206 --> 00:34:06.389
as well as the little boy who
was there sitting before. He's

ec6ce8f4-7f43-43c1-b143-0486f2b209bf-2
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:11.760
looking at the town squares
fountain with a backpack

ec6ce8f4-7f43-43c1-b143-0486f2b209bf-3
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.930
standing. He still has a look of
concern or worry.

974e556f-1142-429e-8670-41339e427347-0
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.273
Meanwhile, Ohh I think I see. I
see the artist. Sorry, the

974e556f-1142-429e-8670-41339e427347-1
00:34:22.273 --> 00:34:22.920
artist is.

96218904-8ca1-40ea-96ff-a5eae1a2f7fe-0
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.880
Actually no longer in his
studio, but he's downstairs in

96218904-8ca1-40ea-96ff-a5eae1a2f7fe-1
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.410
his in the front of his
building.

7fadd277-fab8-4538-ba77-1628acf71d62-0
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.031
Sitting and chatting with his
neighbor friend who is a

7fadd277-fab8-4538-ba77-1628acf71d62-1
00:34:36.031 --> 00:34:36.650
cellist.

bbde8f34-2443-4121-8ebb-4d18114d4d07-0
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.980
And having a conversation.

2d3b30cc-8e58-4098-8dbc-06967a628f80-0
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.210
And watching the street life.

916c1fea-8445-461c-abdd-4c7e5343bf8e-0
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.610
Towards the the back there is.

8a31dad2-704a-4089-b505-803ae6722be9-0
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.900
Some people who are, have they
they seem to be.

bca233ae-e6ec-41a4-9a49-711d9334d037-0
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.230


4951c7a3-3738-45a6-a2e8-cd76ef71a771-0
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.920
A man who is trying to sell
something in the background with

4951c7a3-3738-45a6-a2e8-cd76ef71a771-1
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.360
a cart or wheel cart.

3dbfb715-3f67-417c-878d-01f01008e968-0
00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:09.020
Um, the town is is vibrant.

211184a7-2199-4767-9bd7-6871c2cff6b1-0
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.080
Lots of people, lots of
movement.

1e8009ba-7c7d-4dea-95fd-5f4811dd5044-0
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.730
And people are coming and going.

f7b937b5-de4e-46c2-b92f-c0f0cf68cbe4-0
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.753
Ohh, all of a sudden the house
is looking more and more

f7b937b5-de4e-46c2-b92f-c0f0cf68cbe4-1
00:35:28.753 --> 00:35:34.775
complete as the man has worked
on the one story home. Now that

f7b937b5-de4e-46c2-b92f-c0f0cf68cbe4-2
00:35:34.775 --> 00:35:40.892
his chimney is even is in multi
colors, he's got flowers around

f7b937b5-de4e-46c2-b92f-c0f0cf68cbe4-3
00:35:40.892 --> 00:35:42.039
his windows.

880093dc-6dee-402a-a203-0d23f6a7f582-0
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.137
Um, he's putting more flowers
around this fence and he is

880093dc-6dee-402a-a203-0d23f6a7f582-1
00:35:47.137 --> 00:35:48.110
waving hello.

d96b8dfb-646e-4911-b2b7-d272fe21728a-0
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.208
To a neighbor who is about to
drive by his house on a scooter,

d96b8dfb-646e-4911-b2b7-d272fe21728a-1
00:35:53.208 --> 00:35:55.880
so he is getting to know his
neighbors.

ef33807e-0cfe-4c6b-828e-6a8ea3a58f07-0
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.700
He is well established in his
town.

5ed7f639-571d-48b5-aa90-46c3c7897028-0
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.430
the town life is still very
active.

4bf4e0de-a580-4bb0-9315-d0ebcc8271c9-0
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.609
But this? The boy in front of
the square is still there and

4bf4e0de-a580-4bb0-9315-d0ebcc8271c9-1
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:15.060
still looking at the fountain.
There is another.

ada136c3-6562-4571-a388-429dc74f2e00-0
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.212
Person who is also in color,
while the rest of the picture

ada136c3-6562-4571-a388-429dc74f2e00-1
00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:26.730
other than the house and the old
man is still in black and white.

cefc33b4-c28c-4f9c-b6cb-b23bf77f9956-0
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.278
It looks to be a girl who is
holding a flower and she is

cefc33b4-c28c-4f9c-b6cb-b23bf77f9956-1
00:36:32.278 --> 00:36:37.392
walking away from the house and
and she has red hair. She's

cefc33b4-c28c-4f9c-b6cb-b23bf77f9956-2
00:36:37.392 --> 00:36:42.506
walking and looking at the
flowers so she is either talking

cefc33b4-c28c-4f9c-b6cb-b23bf77f9956-3
00:36:42.506 --> 00:36:47.534
to the flower or trying to
figure out what she wants to do

cefc33b4-c28c-4f9c-b6cb-b23bf77f9956-4
00:36:47.534 --> 00:36:53.160
with the flower. She's wearing a
blue skirt and a yellow top and.

5bc9a2fe-9e13-4988-a4da-66fd8494cd13-0
00:36:55.090 --> 00:37:00.892
Walking towards the artist home,
the artist is on the 2nd floor

5bc9a2fe-9e13-4988-a4da-66fd8494cd13-1
00:37:00.892 --> 00:37:06.422
and his studio at the window
seal with a palette and looking

5bc9a2fe-9e13-4988-a4da-66fd8494cd13-2
00:37:06.422 --> 00:37:07.510
at the town.

f742b884-f29d-4473-83d9-0fd25ea27dc4-0
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:12.440
In the next building there is
still the man who is.

9daff5ef-91c7-49b5-b05c-ea6afbe066b0-0
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:20.133
I think either taking a bath
still. Oh, I think the the woman

9daff5ef-91c7-49b5-b05c-ea6afbe066b0-1
00:37:20.133 --> 00:37:22.590
who is facing the mirror.

869fbb4e-b0ed-41ec-b9f9-893d9882c100-0
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:30.230
Is now either. Maybe she was a
Barber or hairstylist because

869fbb4e-b0ed-41ec-b9f9-893d9882c100-1
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:35.440
there's a person also and hard
to see but has some.

f48cdb7d-4f2e-4295-a901-513255ed7e91-0
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.920
Maybe having a haircut?

943f495d-8876-4b52-8d27-172387f655de-0
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.250
Um, yeah, the town is still very
active. It's during the day, um.

c28ac2a0-8b0e-42ff-bb86-347bb82d57f8-0
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:51.420
Oh, it's actually 8:30. Um, I
see for the first time that

c28ac2a0-8b0e-42ff-bb86-347bb82d57f8-1
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.220
there's one building that has a
time 8:35. That must be 8:35 in

c28ac2a0-8b0e-42ff-bb86-347bb82d57f8-2
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.120
the morning.

2ff57671-d4ff-4fa1-bb10-fa89f99210e3-0
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.692
This building has a sign to the
to the side that says Cola, so

2ff57671-d4ff-4fa1-bb10-fa89f99210e3-1
00:38:04.692 --> 00:38:10.105
I'm assuming it's a Coca-Cola
and there's a man that's sitting

2ff57671-d4ff-4fa1-bb10-fa89f99210e3-2
00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:15.690
in an elderly man who's sitting
in a chair against the building.

a6676bd2-e9f8-40ef-8313-2f4d0eab80f9-0
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.980
I don't know if it's a grocery
store.

48e70add-0b1f-463d-9995-a900908612df-0
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:25.182
But on the second level and the
third level you see pictures of

48e70add-0b1f-463d-9995-a900908612df-1
00:38:25.182 --> 00:38:26.070
people also.

5926c90e-ec9a-4b4d-8edd-e11caa43779a-0
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.952
In their daily lives, I'm
beginning to see a little bit of

5926c90e-ec9a-4b4d-8edd-e11caa43779a-1
00:38:32.952 --> 00:38:38.336
of color on the on this in the
sky. It's very faint, but it's

5926c90e-ec9a-4b4d-8edd-e11caa43779a-2
00:38:38.336 --> 00:38:40.420
also a faint blue color.

c23e04e3-f606-45c2-8eab-929f8b099acf-0
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.980
Ohh.

ef6339b3-b05a-45a5-b57f-0f3bb29b21e2-0
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:50.023
More color as the picture is
still showing people that we

ef6339b3-b05a-45a5-b57f-0f3bb29b21e2-1
00:38:50.023 --> 00:38:55.183
know. There's the old man who is
in front of his house now

ef6339b3-b05a-45a5-b57f-0f3bb29b21e2-2
00:38:55.183 --> 00:39:00.868
completed with a window open and
you see he has really renovated

ef6339b3-b05a-45a5-b57f-0f3bb29b21e2-3
00:39:00.868 --> 00:39:04.630
his home beautifully and he is
talking to.

e6fd66b7-8ef3-4851-81e2-090b66cc4f07-0
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:11.755
He's talking to another person
and in a very friendly manner,

e6fd66b7-8ef3-4851-81e2-090b66cc4f07-1
00:39:11.755 --> 00:39:16.720
as well as a little boy who is
facing him on the cobblestone.

a8461103-d78e-49b1-93d1-5b484781b9db-0
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:26.197
More and more images and people
in color on this page. The blue

a8461103-d78e-49b1-93d1-5b484781b9db-1
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.300
the sky is bluer.

3db8e9d7-4dfe-464d-99c4-d615f6b50c86-0
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.978
There's a mixture of of
buildings that are still in

3db8e9d7-4dfe-464d-99c4-d615f6b50c86-1
00:39:34.978 --> 00:39:41.502
black and white, but some of the
colors are shown in the window.

3db8e9d7-4dfe-464d-99c4-d615f6b50c86-2
00:39:41.502 --> 00:39:47.323
Seals and shutters, brick,
sidewalk, brick building sides

3db8e9d7-4dfe-464d-99c4-d615f6b50c86-3
00:39:47.323 --> 00:39:53.645
the awnings of the buildings.
Some people are shown also to be

3db8e9d7-4dfe-464d-99c4-d615f6b50c86-4
00:39:53.645 --> 00:39:59.667
in color. For example, the
artist is now in color holding a

3db8e9d7-4dfe-464d-99c4-d615f6b50c86-5
00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:00.369
flower.

230b783a-2d97-481c-bb5e-cb80cafff4ec-0
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.030
The little boy who looked.

4658f31d-5521-462c-8785-5581e5e81f7a-0
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.030
And worried is still by the
fountain, but he is now in

4658f31d-5521-462c-8785-5581e5e81f7a-1
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:15.082
color. He is still carrying a
backpack. He is still looking at

4658f31d-5521-462c-8785-5581e5e81f7a-2
00:40:15.082 --> 00:40:20.134
the fountain, but he is pointing
to something and there is a a

4658f31d-5521-462c-8785-5581e5e81f7a-3
00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:22.460
white flower in the fountain.

25da1646-21c3-4ed6-b113-e5891ffabfb3-0
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.874
Meanwhile, there is I think
there's more people either

25da1646-21c3-4ed6-b113-e5891ffabfb3-1
00:40:27.874 --> 00:40:32.076
moving in or out of because
there's a truck right by the

25da1646-21c3-4ed6-b113-e5891ffabfb3-2
00:40:32.076 --> 00:40:36.795
town square fountain that says
movers and shakers. It's hard to

25da1646-21c3-4ed6-b113-e5891ffabfb3-3
00:40:36.795 --> 00:40:40.850
tell whether these people are
moving in or moving out.

4411e5a8-deba-4777-9d34-ed2caf887036-0
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:47.760
Um, the man who is taking a bath
again. He is now in full color.

623fb0fb-16aa-4cf9-aa90-fc4f00ce881f-0
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.880
As well as.

1c632725-80ad-470c-9a3b-dfe4a34241f7-0
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.833
The old man who was standing. Oh
no, the old man that is

1c632725-80ad-470c-9a3b-dfe4a34241f7-1
00:40:56.833 --> 00:41:01.252
standing, that was sitting by
the Coca-Cola side. He is still

1c632725-80ad-470c-9a3b-dfe4a34241f7-2
00:41:01.252 --> 00:41:03.320
not in color, but there is a.

b80c2ead-e233-4e71-8649-05f7984aef67-0
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:11.510
There is a man right by the
Coca-Cola stand by the entrance.

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-0
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:19.184
Who is embracing a girl that was
holding a flower. previously she

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-1
00:41:19.184 --> 00:41:23.744
was the one that was wearing the
blue skirt and a yellow top,

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-2
00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:28.010
with an animal, and she's
embracing the man by the by the

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-3
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:32.791
door. This time around. There is
no time suggested on the on the

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-4
00:41:32.791 --> 00:41:37.352
on the building, so we don't
know what time of the day it is,

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-5
00:41:37.352 --> 00:41:41.838
but it looks to still be during
the day. Umm, there's also a

b97abdf7-4f75-41a0-a03d-55dfc970713d-6
00:41:41.838 --> 00:41:43.310
milkman in the back.

4bbc1c34-8fcf-4c01-b954-5f3a43370a3c-0
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.650
Um.

6a88835d-744e-4dc2-929a-f0aaa9e8986f-0
00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:51.439
Talking to a boy. The milkman is
in color, but the boy that he is

6a88835d-744e-4dc2-929a-f0aaa9e8986f-1
00:41:51.439 --> 00:41:56.271
talking to is not. So it's an
interesting page that has some

6a88835d-744e-4dc2-929a-f0aaa9e8986f-2
00:41:56.271 --> 00:42:00.946
people in full color, very
bright colors, and other people

6a88835d-744e-4dc2-929a-f0aaa9e8986f-3
00:42:00.946 --> 00:42:03.640
who are still in black and
white.

1dce158c-0262-4878-b006-601136d285ea-0
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.080
More and more color is being
added to the same town square.

56161e48-ec56-4f73-a09d-35846f59b960-0
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:19.595
Now I see that uh, the old man
is having a BBQ, is holding our

56161e48-ec56-4f73-a09d-35846f59b960-1
00:42:19.595 --> 00:42:25.632
plane with a a child that I I
would think is a grandchild of

56161e48-ec56-4f73-a09d-35846f59b960-2
00:42:25.632 --> 00:42:31.867
his and the child is happy and
the grandfather is playing with

56161e48-ec56-4f73-a09d-35846f59b960-3
00:42:31.867 --> 00:42:37.904
him and there is a grandmother
in the background who is also

56161e48-ec56-4f73-a09d-35846f59b960-4
00:42:37.904 --> 00:42:41.270
looking on and seems to be
happy.

ef564547-fb03-425b-9992-c1440498add2-0
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.526
And one thing I see is that the
boy who is by the fountain, the

ef564547-fb03-425b-9992-c1440498add2-1
00:42:47.526 --> 00:42:51.992
fountain is now working and the
boy is genuinely happy. So I

ef564547-fb03-425b-9992-c1440498add2-2
00:42:51.992 --> 00:42:56.532
think that he's happy enough
that the fountain is working and

ef564547-fb03-425b-9992-c1440498add2-3
00:42:56.532 --> 00:43:00.706
there's water coming out.
Meanwhile, the artist is still

ef564547-fb03-425b-9992-c1440498add2-4
00:43:00.706 --> 00:43:04.660
hard at work in his studio. The
man is still bathing.

ca088a94-2e64-4210-89a2-8c5908f22da4-0
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.940
There's a woman in the next door
who still has another.

f7db25f9-9477-4bbf-9887-b95bc58ea348-0
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.970
Client or a person who is facing
the mirror.

c28e11fa-e1f2-46b4-a639-6e80bcb5fca5-0
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.020
At the top of this building.

1df39a7d-35f7-4107-ba8e-ab78992d851e-0
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.673
Oh, I see that now. The artist
is actually, there's somebody

1df39a7d-35f7-4107-ba8e-ab78992d851e-1
00:43:27.673 --> 00:43:32.870
who's helping the artist sell
his paintings on the street.

1f055c0b-3958-488f-9d5b-0faeb8a4c0c2-0
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:40.619
And it looks as though somebody
has actually purchased his or

1f055c0b-3958-488f-9d5b-0faeb8a4c0c2-1
00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:47.257
her painting because she's about
to go off in a red, fairly

1f055c0b-3958-488f-9d5b-0faeb8a4c0c2-2
00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.360
modern looking car.

1f66a6bc-3a96-4bcd-9119-08732cf4319e-0
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.980
She looks happy.

afdab892-c36c-4443-ae80-bce6e6dcaa1b-0
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.920
And.

964ef8f1-1dfe-4634-a6ec-ce0740576643-0
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.660
There's a boy.

828cb27e-3e6f-4e49-b3b6-ebdfe23a9761-0
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.106
And there's a group of boys
who's holding a ball with a a

828cb27e-3e6f-4e49-b3b6-ebdfe23a9761-1
00:44:03.106 --> 00:44:07.719
dog, suggesting that they're
trying to figure out if they're

828cb27e-3e6f-4e49-b3b6-ebdfe23a9761-2
00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:08.400
going to.

2534e8e2-5fb8-4adf-9bd5-16e9e58a2b6a-0
00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:13.399
Play ball again or they're gonna
meet up at a different time.

2534e8e2-5fb8-4adf-9bd5-16e9e58a2b6a-1
00:44:13.399 --> 00:44:17.658
There's a man who's still in a
wheelchair with a broken left

2534e8e2-5fb8-4adf-9bd5-16e9e58a2b6a-2
00:44:17.658 --> 00:44:21.290
leg, but he's having a nice,
pleasant conversation.

dc3ad2d3-f35f-4798-ab3f-2082f21146ca-0
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:28.864
With the girl in eyeglasses and
be he's being pushed by and a

dc3ad2d3-f35f-4798-ab3f-2082f21146ca-1
00:44:28.864 --> 00:44:35.578
lady in a pink dress who looks
like she is a visitor. She is

dc3ad2d3-f35f-4798-ab3f-2082f21146ca-2
00:44:35.578 --> 00:44:38.550
not from this city because.

5b22dbfa-45cc-4289-ab00-af7e3147e662-0
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:41.380
She's, she's wearing.

48fc6125-01c3-473b-b93a-e12b071781b4-0
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.298
Clothes that suggests that she's
come to visit or there's a nice

48fc6125-01c3-473b-b93a-e12b071781b4-1
00:44:47.298 --> 00:44:47.570
big.

b24e3dd1-330e-4604-b83c-ae11d38146f9-0
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:54.391
truck that, says milk. So the
milkman is actually not hard at

b24e3dd1-330e-4604-b83c-ae11d38146f9-1
00:44:54.391 --> 00:45:00.011
work these he's actually dancing
with somebody or singing on the

b24e3dd1-330e-4604-b83c-ae11d38146f9-2
00:45:00.011 --> 00:45:05.459
edge of the the bridge. But he
seems to be having a good time.

b24e3dd1-330e-4604-b83c-ae11d38146f9-3
00:45:05.459 --> 00:45:10.560
And even the old man who is
sitting by the Coca-Cola stand

b24e3dd1-330e-4604-b83c-ae11d38146f9-4
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:16.267
building, even though he's still
sitting, he seems to be in color

b24e3dd1-330e-4604-b83c-ae11d38146f9-5
00:45:16.267 --> 00:45:18.169
and looks to be happy.

8d6f0f62-84de-4aa9-a92a-2566281daacf-0
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:25.318
He has a a kind face. It is 10
past four, so I'm assuming it's

8d6f0f62-84de-4aa9-a92a-2566281daacf-1
00:45:25.318 --> 00:45:27.500
four in the afternoon.

3485bba7-c8a7-4b74-9269-f8ad6fa87988-0
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.360
Um and.

f7886305-582f-4490-a8e3-2eaa5d9dbc49-0
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.821
The house has been fully
renovated, there's a dog on the

f7886305-582f-4490-a8e3-2eaa5d9dbc49-1
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:40.886
yard, and the cobblestones are
no longer just black and white,

f7886305-582f-4490-a8e3-2eaa5d9dbc49-2
00:45:40.886 --> 00:45:45.870
but in multicolors. This the
city is, or the town is vibrant.

c84f00af-225c-429c-9ec8-89976fb307ca-0
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.740
Um, it's a picture of the town.

afc6fc2f-97af-4619-9b24-a827cbc66785-0
00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:01.679
At the closer to the evening
because the street lights are on

afc6fc2f-97af-4619-9b24-a827cbc66785-1
00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:06.680
illuminated as well as the fact
that it was almost 8:50.

a0b6d47d-628e-4480-bc4c-742a20bf016b-0
00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:13.087
I'm assuming it's uh in the
evening the milkman is still

a0b6d47d-628e-4480-bc4c-742a20bf016b-1
00:46:13.087 --> 00:46:15.560
there, not doing his job.

79e11784-186e-406b-8b68-c529bd4e997f-0
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:22.501
But I'm trying to find the
milkman and I can't. I can't see

79e11784-186e-406b-8b68-c529bd4e997f-1
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:28.305
him, but the old man sitting by
the Coca-Cola building is still

79e11784-186e-406b-8b68-c529bd4e997f-2
00:46:28.305 --> 00:46:28.850
there.

198abeb2-50de-4cb2-aa1d-81a63ae50261-0
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:35.660
still sitting for the first
time. The man is no longer in

198abeb2-50de-4cb2-aa1d-81a63ae50261-1
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.900
the bathtub.

64e36fe3-4c13-406a-aae0-252eee0de016-0
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:43.803
Don't know where he is, but oh,
I see him now. He's at the top

64e36fe3-4c13-406a-aae0-252eee0de016-1
00:46:43.803 --> 00:46:44.970
of the building.

e9c54984-d5f2-4c0f-a35b-b647ecc8d198-0
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:52.138
Getting don't know what he's
doing, but he's holding a basket

e9c54984-d5f2-4c0f-a35b-b647ecc8d198-1
00:46:52.138 --> 00:46:58.291
full of either fruit or flowers
and he looks genuinely happy but

e9c54984-d5f2-4c0f-a35b-b647ecc8d198-2
00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.090
is still unclothed.

23f0bbba-8c99-4f7c-b7ae-a946032648ee-0
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.140
Um.

440b6995-1949-4fc8-a9d1-3658cd861f9b-0
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.190
the

c281ef79-887a-4e41-b630-c4d16c5e93b6-0
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.640
It looks as though the woman
that was yelling or shouting at

c281ef79-887a-4e41-b630-c4d16c5e93b6-1
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:17.787
the child earlier on in the
picture, that is where the man

c281ef79-887a-4e41-b630-c4d16c5e93b6-2
00:47:17.787 --> 00:47:23.282
who lives, who bathed. It looks
as though she was the one that

c281ef79-887a-4e41-b630-c4d16c5e93b6-3
00:47:23.282 --> 00:47:28.342
moved because there seems to be
another family or another

c281ef79-887a-4e41-b630-c4d16c5e93b6-4
00:47:28.342 --> 00:47:29.040
happier.

162aadf8-d97a-4570-a1f1-19c194a65088-0
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.110
Picture of a a of a child and a
man.

44d74b51-d325-4b14-a773-ad25171c3159-0
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:36.000
Sitting by the window.

0e65eb66-6704-44ef-91a2-0039150135b6-0
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.290
That is in the room.

d4bd0514-c60b-4251-bf6d-04f052d28ed6-0
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:46.764
The boys are still playing
soccer or kickball going towards

d4bd0514-c60b-4251-bf6d-04f052d28ed6-1
00:47:46.764 --> 00:47:47.080
the.

fa4ef919-cf12-4d8e-bdc3-dd9da57196a0-0
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:53.325
Um, going towards the fountain
and it looks as though the boy

fa4ef919-cf12-4d8e-bdc3-dd9da57196a0-1
00:47:53.325 --> 00:47:58.378
that was by the fountain who
looked happy is now has now

fa4ef919-cf12-4d8e-bdc3-dd9da57196a0-2
00:47:58.378 --> 00:48:04.140
joined the the other children to
play kickball and he looks very

fa4ef919-cf12-4d8e-bdc3-dd9da57196a0-3
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.547
happy. The man, even the man who
is on the wheelchair with a

fa4ef919-cf12-4d8e-bdc3-dd9da57196a0-4
00:48:09.547 --> 00:48:15.043
broken leg, is also engaged in
some kind of activity with the

fa4ef919-cf12-4d8e-bdc3-dd9da57196a0-5
00:48:15.043 --> 00:48:17.880
boys playing soccer or football.

71d62f54-5fa7-459c-8abe-781a1e130134-0
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:25.330
Um, there's a mixture of of
elderly people, children.

6674dde4-09a1-4ed7-bb27-be71eb10a3f1-0
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.080
On the streets.

6b94c650-ef42-4a52-8a67-c7b0a21247c8-0
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:33.967
Neighbors saying hello and
sharing a meal. There's a woman

6b94c650-ef42-4a52-8a67-c7b0a21247c8-1
00:48:33.967 --> 00:48:38.672
coming down with a I don't know,
it looks like a dessert, maybe

6b94c650-ef42-4a52-8a67-c7b0a21247c8-2
00:48:38.672 --> 00:48:43.156
like a flambe. It looks like
she's talking to her friend. So

6b94c650-ef42-4a52-8a67-c7b0a21247c8-3
00:48:43.156 --> 00:48:47.714
there's a lot of engagement and
interaction. The only thing I

6b94c650-ef42-4a52-8a67-c7b0a21247c8-4
00:48:47.714 --> 00:48:48.670
don't see is.

6a4a49dc-bb4d-41da-95e9-471148c6d749-0
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:55.765
That the house, the colorful one
story home. There's nobody in in

6a4a49dc-bb4d-41da-95e9-471148c6d749-1
00:48:55.765 --> 00:49:01.261
in front. The windows are open
but the old man and they and

6a4a49dc-bb4d-41da-95e9-471148c6d749-2
00:49:01.261 --> 00:49:06.940
they. The grandmother is not to
be seen, other than there's a

6a4a49dc-bb4d-41da-95e9-471148c6d749-3
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:12.894
dog that seems to be waiting for
his owner to come home in front

6a4a49dc-bb4d-41da-95e9-471148c6d749-4
00:49:12.894 --> 00:49:14.910
of the one story home.

4aa1d569-a447-43e1-b47e-521b2e2e101a-0
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.380
The scene goes back to.

494988b4-5dd1-490e-ac38-49b317780c63-0
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:29.160
Oh, the oh, I don't know if it's
the old man who is.

e473f759-b772-4513-b8ea-357e183ca9c5-0
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:38.230
Uh owned the and who changed the
one story home he looks to be.

e8f4cf0c-90b7-4d03-b8cb-f26fcbcbf811-0
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:44.924
with a bag, a coat and an
umbrella with the dog. He seems

e8f4cf0c-90b7-4d03-b8cb-f26fcbcbf811-1
00:49:44.924 --> 00:49:48.240
to be walking away from the
house.

5fb73332-b990-4319-8288-79122ef46e69-0
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:56.540
The most of the images on the on
the.

90ff486b-35b1-44c2-8ac9-4fa04d69b4ba-0
00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.320
Story is in full color.

42dfde6c-67e9-4774-9317-ddb9d4a168e0-0
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.914
Seems to be sometime in the
evening because the street

42dfde6c-67e9-4774-9317-ddb9d4a168e0-1
00:50:05.914 --> 00:50:08.660
lights are eliminated,
illuminated.

b3ed7463-172a-4063-8bbc-81d54cfaa973-0
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:16.930
The square Town Square where the
fountain is, is.

41f81df3-ddcb-461e-9640-003f45c77f4c-0
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:23.080
has water, but the children seem
to have gone home.

195d60c3-c73a-4c12-81be-e985e264d562-0
00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.440
There is a cat on the roof.

ce340b12-3ad7-4b72-adee-48b0420b96d4-0
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.930
People seem to be settled in his
in their homes.

3c458064-4484-43c2-a8f2-d1e9799359a5-0
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:40.327
There is a woman looking out
into the courtyard, thinking

3c458064-4484-43c2-a8f2-d1e9799359a5-1
00:50:40.327 --> 00:50:40.940
about.

5f59a91c-1ed0-45ba-a99d-d5fd89ce26ea-0
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:47.724
Either her day or her or
someone. There is a a man and a

5f59a91c-1ed0-45ba-a99d-d5fd89ce26ea-1
00:50:47.724 --> 00:50:53.204
woman who is dancing in the
building that says Cafe. There

5f59a91c-1ed0-45ba-a99d-d5fd89ce26ea-2
00:50:53.204 --> 00:50:58.870
is a elderly man with an eye
patch who's on a motorcycle was

5f59a91c-1ed0-45ba-a99d-d5fd89ce26ea-3
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.100
saying hello to another.

1b1fc657-6371-4b1c-be37-0c06c27db37c-0
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:07.070
Either a neighbor or in the
middle of the street.

6fa2b0b2-8ab3-4f1b-989d-39f52d002ccc-0
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:16.772
And um, the it looks as though
this is at the corner of it is.

6fa2b0b2-8ab3-4f1b-989d-39f52d002ccc-1
00:51:16.772 --> 00:51:24.136
The only person that seems to be
walking away from the town

6fa2b0b2-8ab3-4f1b-989d-39f52d002ccc-2
00:51:24.136 --> 00:51:31.869
square is the original old man
in the coat and a scarf and his

6fa2b0b2-8ab3-4f1b-989d-39f52d002ccc-3
00:51:31.869 --> 00:51:32.360
dog.

5f6321cf-13df-4a72-b409-dd2c81f673f3-0
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.600
So this is the.

7101bd65-3ed1-4a96-9da6-6e8ff6b2d251-0
00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:40.380
OK.

eb9da280-ac1a-4583-9800-c4d76a963c02-0
00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:49.758
So the old man um is the only
person in this story page that

eb9da280-ac1a-4583-9800-c4d76a963c02-1
00:51:49.758 --> 00:51:56.267
is in color. He is holding
either a ticket or a number that

eb9da280-ac1a-4583-9800-c4d76a963c02-2
00:51:56.267 --> 00:52:03.103
says 10 in front of a building
that says for sale. The rest of

eb9da280-ac1a-4583-9800-c4d76a963c02-3
00:52:03.103 --> 00:52:09.504
the pictures in blue or black
and white except for the sky

eb9da280-ac1a-4583-9800-c4d76a963c02-4
00:52:09.504 --> 00:52:13.410
that is in a vibrant purple
clouds.

02e87541-cc30-4d09-8f97-7013de97b2f8-0
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:18.130
It looks as though it's a ground
level, um.

c84e00a0-806b-4e37-88ef-f5ae6de40cbd-0
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.228
The Ohh the dog is also his dog
is also in color, and the dog

c84e00a0-806b-4e37-88ef-f5ae6de40cbd-1
00:52:24.228 --> 00:52:28.400
seems to be excited, but there's
another dog that is.

fdcf780b-35c8-4954-a35c-a6892a528758-0
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:34.637
To the background, looking in on
the old man who is standing by

fdcf780b-35c8-4954-a35c-a6892a528758-1
00:52:34.637 --> 00:52:34.940
the.

50a664b0-c285-4a07-b284-b2cc34f6ef1c-0
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:38.340
The corner of a of a building.

b7f2ec1b-ddcc-435e-bf11-61f608b689a6-0
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:46.577
It must be also sometime in the
early evening because the the

b7f2ec1b-ddcc-435e-bf11-61f608b689a6-1
00:52:46.577 --> 00:52:51.923
city the street lamp is
illuminated and there is a man

b7f2ec1b-ddcc-435e-bf11-61f608b689a6-2
00:52:51.923 --> 00:52:57.756
with a pipe that is looking at
the old man looking a little

b7f2ec1b-ddcc-435e-bf11-61f608b689a6-3
00:52:57.756 --> 00:52:59.019
surprised or.

68f3c0e9-416a-403c-85ea-f48b4210648a-0
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.450
Not.

b4ec9f95-4eb5-4dc5-9a9f-4aeb88359ae4-0
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:08.884
Afraid but alarmed, as well as
on the 2nd floor, there is a

b4ec9f95-4eb5-4dc5-9a9f-4aeb88359ae4-1
00:53:08.884 --> 00:53:13.420
woman and her child also looking
at the old man.

c5ae01e1-3193-48d6-b2dd-c5680c0ace73-0
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:25.670
As the old man is about to leave
and he's walking with the.

95ea7531-62b5-44d4-a0a0-4b878f723452-0
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.170
Dog.

91a81df5-2c45-4f6d-bbe6-23e64c4cfd41-0
00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:34.754
The little girl that was on the
2nd floor seems to have come

91a81df5-2c45-4f6d-bbe6-23e64c4cfd41-1
00:53:34.754 --> 00:53:40.828
running down. He is also holding
a purple flower that I think was

91a81df5-2c45-4f6d-bbe6-23e64c4cfd41-2
00:53:40.828 --> 00:53:46.350
given by somebody, either the
old man or somebody else. She

91a81df5-2c45-4f6d-bbe6-23e64c4cfd41-3
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:51.965
looks very genuinely happy and
pleased. She has a little pet

91a81df5-2c45-4f6d-bbe6-23e64c4cfd41-4
00:53:51.965 --> 00:53:53.990
mouse on her shoulder.

ec703ff9-45e1-4df9-ab64-414e12778bf5-0
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.000
she is in a red

b308b1b5-099d-4283-8917-05ef975caf6c-0
00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.400
Outfit with.

1b5c1408-6b82-4be1-96af-0bc7fc281469-0
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:08.880
Yellow T-shirt and while the
rest of the building and the the

1b5c1408-6b82-4be1-96af-0bc7fc281469-1
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:14.626
street steps are in black and
white, there is another man in

1b5c1408-6b82-4be1-96af-0bc7fc281469-2
00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:20.654
the window that is looking out
and looking at the girl. I don't

1b5c1408-6b82-4be1-96af-0bc7fc281469-3
00:54:20.654 --> 00:54:26.494
know if he's the person that
gave her the flower, but he also

1b5c1408-6b82-4be1-96af-0bc7fc281469-4
00:54:26.494 --> 00:54:32.429
seems to be in a very content
mood. He is also in color with a

1b5c1408-6b82-4be1-96af-0bc7fc281469-5
00:54:32.429 --> 00:54:32.900
nice.

59d788c6-c7b3-45af-a735-8acddcbbef99-0

that was the story. Let's take a
break.}

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:51.530
This next item is again a
complex scene.

cd417ec1-8553-4656-8f9a-bd1ee9ce803c-0

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.760
three and five minutes.}

ready.}

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:24.170
Many.

24940a5b-5ca7-4067-b287-cd9508fd8f90-0
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:26.010
Of these.

041ae47a-9328-4285-a525-540989a71c30-0
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:29.310
Men.

fa72223f-5fae-48ac-bf47-7538e2eab115-0
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:34.820
Uh, I think there are more men
than women, though it's hard to

fa72223f-5fae-48ac-bf47-7538e2eab115-1
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.710
see a lot of them are wearing
the red and white striped pants.

092ebab6-1b36-4ac8-b9ae-99da3e79ed10-0
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:46.787
That is the the waldos image. I
do see some blue and white

092ebab6-1b36-4ac8-b9ae-99da3e79ed10-1
00:55:46.787 --> 00:55:53.706
stripes, pants as well, as well
as green and white stripes, but

092ebab6-1b36-4ac8-b9ae-99da3e79ed10-2
00:55:53.706 --> 00:55:58.030
the red seems to stand out. Oh I
oh OK.

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-0
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:04.497
So this image is underwater
images as well as above water.

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-1
00:56:04.497 --> 00:56:08.940
Above water there are many
boats, one at least a dozen

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-2
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.869
boats that are floating. Many of
the boats have the blue and

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-3
00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:18.717
white stripes or the red and
white, so I don't know if it's

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-4
00:56:18.717 --> 00:56:23.726
divided by people wearing the
same. No, it doesn't seem to be

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-5
00:56:23.726 --> 00:56:28.897
that way. There's also some fish
mingled between they're trying

952a7e6d-2688-4911-8e13-fda42a3b8a03-6
00:56:28.897 --> 00:56:29.140
to.

c7276af3-60ee-408c-9fa5-d715299cc143-0
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.560
Some of these men are trying to
fish.

ec896d9f-7c00-49c1-8780-522e11d550d1-0
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.290
Um, there is one.

f29c1854-16ab-4b64-b280-ba3c03682aa8-0
00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:43.538
Image of a man who is about to
catch a very large fish that

f29c1854-16ab-4b64-b280-ba3c03682aa8-1
00:56:43.538 --> 00:56:46.970
seems angry that seems to be
about.

bd614fd9-b16c-4eb5-a4eb-cdc3f1c71257-0
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:52.267
To surface to the top of the the
water is multi colored, almost

bd614fd9-b16c-4eb5-a4eb-cdc3f1c71257-1
00:56:52.267 --> 00:56:56.906
like a rainbow fish, but he has
very sharp teeth so I don't know

bd614fd9-b16c-4eb5-a4eb-cdc3f1c71257-2
00:56:56.906 --> 00:56:59.190
if that man's going to be happy.

5c43415c-282b-49b4-bdb4-01c45d321d4e-0
00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:08.025
There's also people on rocks at
the top of the water fishing on

5c43415c-282b-49b4-bdb4-01c45d321d4e-1
00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:12.690
trying to get some fish as well
as another.

ed506b0f-51f3-4f9d-a421-525bca287596-0
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.540
Rocks, kind of like a Cliff.

c5cb1c1c-0303-4d02-b773-90ecadbc804f-0
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:22.290
All occupied by mermaid like.

816fdd60-ec58-481c-9865-1fac492f660d-0
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:29.073
figures as well as a man who
looks like he's an elderly man

816fdd60-ec58-481c-9865-1fac492f660d-1
00:57:29.073 --> 00:57:31.680
and a white beard and a white

57c3c8a9-32e8-49c5-9a21-d868d476d6b1-0
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.650
oil cloth as well as holding on
to something.

50471b12-52f8-45f8-95da-290414df078c-0
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:47.385
Um, the underground. There's an
interaction, many interactions

50471b12-52f8-45f8-95da-290414df078c-1
00:57:47.385 --> 00:57:50.950
of people with mermaids and
fish.

d29fda09-8960-4600-a41d-b8c057130cae-0
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:57.754
There's an octopus at the bottom
of the sea. There's an angry

d29fda09-8960-4600-a41d-b8c057130cae-1
00:57:57.754 --> 00:57:58.310
looking.

d0f5ab4f-a90e-4ae3-a751-52e10c3ae562-0
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:04.260
Fish or creature that's hiding
behind a red Bush.

2678092c-18e1-42e0-9122-e70962db7994-0
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.330
There's um, I see school of
fish, that is.

94998edd-227c-4bab-bed7-c499202503f2-0
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:22.110
In the shape of an arrow and all
heading downward into the ocean.

e9eb9269-f4bd-4041-aed4-90e37d58c034-0
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:29.422
Um, there's an angry shark
that's closer to the top of the

e9eb9269-f4bd-4041-aed4-90e37d58c034-1
00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:31.520
surface as well as.

81ec8e64-6774-4770-9fac-a2e7e9a85682-0
00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.377
Yeah, some fish that seem happy,
some fish that seemed alarmed

81ec8e64-6774-4770-9fac-a2e7e9a85682-1
00:58:39.377 --> 00:58:44.060
and distressed by all these
people who are also swimming in

81ec8e64-6774-4770-9fac-a2e7e9a85682-2
00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.870
underwater, obviously these
people.

879bb480-af9c-4a03-baa5-9a0b01909a46-0
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:52.540
Don't have problems with the
oxygen, so they seem to be.

49f918da-36be-4ffe-883e-4bce325be88c-0
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:59.234
Even at the bottom of the ocean
they are they're actually.

49f918da-36be-4ffe-883e-4bce325be88c-1
00:58:59.234 --> 00:59:04.017
There's some that actually have
oxygen masks, so maybe not.

49f918da-36be-4ffe-883e-4bce325be88c-2
00:59:04.017 --> 00:59:09.280
Can't tell near the octopus, but
they seem to be genuinely happy.

81562cbc-77b2-4c8d-a31c-e2ae7ea458ae-0
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.430
Not alarmed, not uncomfortable.
Um.

6c1c5c86-704c-4cb5-ab0d-e004df208bd7-0
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:18.560
But the creatures seem to be
more upset.

db94c7d4-da4d-45b3-b31e-ab2a3f35d5ff-0
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.672
And, um, there's some
interaction. There's actually a

db94c7d4-da4d-45b3-b31e-ab2a3f35d5ff-1
00:59:25.672 --> 00:59:26.150
fish.

08266a27-4c19-4915-8d03-7cc9bb8882e4-0
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:31.560
Um, on the left side that is
about to.

1a3bbc18-70d9-42a8-8f87-0f98890ed428-0
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:38.767
#END_deep_sea_divers Take on a a
a person with a big net. So it's

1a3bbc18-70d9-42a8-8f87-0f98890ed428-1
00:59:38.767 --> 00:59:41.420
the reverse scene taking place.

5f0f6d8b-ab3d-4426-a28c-d3ad85520fbb-0
00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:46.790
{Um, so that was about 5
minutes. OK, nice.}

05d31078-95f5-47d5-bf35-a7e1cfa6a9f3-0
00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:49.210
{Um, and then moving on.

a196ce38-99c6-406b-a409-fd33921243b1-0
00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:51.380
There will be another one.}

d9d3d5f2-ebcf-423b-b6a4-b0bb5c7330e3-0
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:59.440
#START_picture_this Um, so this
is a collection of.

31904269-743e-4495-aa6e-083f38489e10-0
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:07.913
Uh, lots of images in a either
like a frame. Ohh yeah, frame

31904269-743e-4495-aa6e-083f38489e10-1
01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:14.350
portraits is what they call it,
but they're lots of images.

d118a39f-a172-4f32-a6ce-b35ca4953a12-0
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:21.420
The one that stands out the most
at this point is the one with.

2fe2233d-8396-42ce-a205-1414ee14c750-0
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:29.529
A sumo wrestler in the in the
right side of the of the the

2fe2233d-8396-42ce-a205-1414ee14c750-1
01:00:29.529 --> 01:00:36.206
page. It's interesting that none
of them are really. They're all

2fe2233d-8396-42ce-a205-1414ee14c750-2
01:00:36.206 --> 01:00:40.520
about the same size, they're
smaller, so.

c359ee6e-9369-447e-abbc-f1a2debe837d-0
01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:46.570
Even though it was trying to
highlight one particular image

c359ee6e-9369-447e-abbc-f1a2debe837d-1
01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:51.370
framed, I can't seem to find one
that I really that stands out.

c359ee6e-9369-447e-abbc-f1a2debe837d-2
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:56.245
They all seem to be of the same
size. There is one person at the

c359ee6e-9369-447e-abbc-f1a2debe837d-3
01:00:56.245 --> 01:01:00.895
corner left, right side, bottom
of the corner that is walking

c359ee6e-9369-447e-abbc-f1a2debe837d-4
01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:02.920
away from all of this in a.

60ba7807-e21a-4ffd-b0e6-ac5ec4a33425-0
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:07.500
Kind of a beach like attire.

e46b644a-db8b-438e-8957-8c420df61d9d-0
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:14.060
The rest, and so I don't know if
this is a mixture of medieval

e46b644a-db8b-438e-8957-8c420df61d9d-1
01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.320
times as well as current times.

74744219-d143-493d-b994-2681080f4624-0
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:25.410
There's some images of of a dog
looking in a box in a bucket.

26592b86-be4d-4e13-835a-f3c846b5b3f9-0
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:32.078
So there's animals. There's a, a
bear tapping on the shoulder of

26592b86-be4d-4e13-835a-f3c846b5b3f9-1
01:01:32.078 --> 01:01:37.167
a person. There's another of an
image of a dragon talking to or

26592b86-be4d-4e13-835a-f3c846b5b3f9-2
01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:41.620
looking at a person who seems to
be sweating. There's a

26592b86-be4d-4e13-835a-f3c846b5b3f9-3
01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.370
hippopotamus having a.

40b36a6c-2d0a-4f27-a93c-d19245f74f60-0
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.750
a nap, um.

238a1dbf-e2c9-4082-a260-f62b7ebc1e41-0
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.840
There's a a cactus that's
running away.

f94f6186-6f61-4dcf-91e7-bb895bd5e33c-0
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:57.770
There's another picture of a
person in a bear, and the bear

f94f6186-6f61-4dcf-91e7-bb895bd5e33c-1
01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:02.911
is kind of playing tricks on on
the the man who is actually

f94f6186-6f61-4dcf-91e7-bb895bd5e33c-2
01:02:02.911 --> 01:02:07.795
being held by the bear by the
collar. So another reverse

f94f6186-6f61-4dcf-91e7-bb895bd5e33c-3
01:02:07.795 --> 01:02:12.678
depiction. There's also a
picture of a dog being dragged

f94f6186-6f61-4dcf-91e7-bb895bd5e33c-4
01:02:12.678 --> 01:02:16.620
by a man. That's the the dog is
running away.

89a7d4ad-7318-41ba-b605-1a39f24bbb37-0
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:25.294
And then there's a yeah, there's
a mishmash of medieval time

89a7d4ad-7318-41ba-b605-1a39f24bbb37-1
01:02:25.294 --> 01:02:27.440
costumes as well as.

bc61ba87-9b27-40e6-b780-db9681affb20-0
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.720
A man either just wearing a
coat.

a438424e-e8d1-431f-961c-abac9c2600d5-0
01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.401
I don't know, he he looks kind
of like waldo the most, but it's

a438424e-e8d1-431f-961c-abac9c2600d5-1
01:02:39.401 --> 01:02:44.661
a very unassuming man, just like
standing on the left side of the

a438424e-e8d1-431f-961c-abac9c2600d5-2
01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:47.930
picture and a red cap and a
orange coat.

900a92ee-6f9f-4d7d-a026-e422a440c38b-0
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:56.019
Um, there's some action
portraits as well as portraits

900a92ee-6f9f-4d7d-a026-e422a440c38b-1
01:02:56.019 --> 01:03:03.407
of just people standing. There's
actually a a fish that has two

900a92ee-6f9f-4d7d-a026-e422a440c38b-2
01:03:03.407 --> 01:03:09.180
heads but no body, and the top
right side of the.

75f82198-c2b7-43c8-865f-b08ac706a307-0
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:12.860
Page um.

7d9b3d72-ead8-4468-80bd-aa56618307c7-0
01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:19.811
There's a dragon on the left
side that's wearing sunglasses.

7d9b3d72-ead8-4468-80bd-aa56618307c7-1
01:03:19.811 --> 01:03:20.720
Ohh, and.

d0c1883c-c49d-4ca6-98b8-e40c84feec48-0
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.429
There's another picture on the
lower right, lower left side of

d0c1883c-c49d-4ca6-98b8-e40c84feec48-1
01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:32.028
a man looks like it's like a
competition of how strong he is

d0c1883c-c49d-4ca6-98b8-e40c84feec48-2
01:03:32.028 --> 01:03:36.778
because he's about to be walked
on by a man who's caring about

d0c1883c-c49d-4ca6-98b8-e40c84feec48-3
01:03:36.778 --> 01:03:41.604
large book. And I think it's to
show how strong he is and being

d0c1883c-c49d-4ca6-98b8-e40c84feec48-4
01:03:41.604 --> 01:03:45.600
able to sustain the weight of
the man and the brick.

d8034093-6279-45a8-8f87-4b6cc73b7a25-0
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:49.840
There's a picture of.

ebee04bb-1567-44e9-88b8-8eb0462ed58a-0
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:57.835
#END_picture_this A man who's
kind of on the ledge of a boxing

ebee04bb-1567-44e9-88b8-8eb0462ed58a-1
01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:03.593
ring or a fence. He looks tired
and doesn't seem to want to

ebee04bb-1567-44e9-88b8-8eb0462ed58a-2
01:04:03.593 --> 01:04:08.200
move, but he's he looks hanging
over the fence.

a05d528d-93e0-427f-8912-31696c9771f5-0
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:15.060
{And then there's Yep. OK, Yep,
it's endless. Yeah.}

fb027532-6369-41ae-8e0c-183b755943dd-0
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:20.591
{There's so much going on. Yeah.
This one will be the last one we

fb027532-6369-41ae-8e0c-183b755943dd-1
01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:24.110
do today. It's a graphic novel
that are OK.}

7f4013e6-640e-4bfb-bd47-57c0640b3a0e-0
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.957
#START_arrival-1 OK, once again,
this is an image of an in kind

7f4013e6-640e-4bfb-bd47-57c0640b3a0e-1
01:04:31.957 --> 01:04:32.170
of.

62a03b14-d6e2-4e91-9218-40ac82e35799-0
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:39.714
Not black and white, but soft
yellow of images. 9 images. The

62a03b14-d6e2-4e91-9218-40ac82e35799-1
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:43.450
first image is a portrait photo
of.

03e94089-2df5-4a41-8b10-d9c6b8dff2f8-0
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:50.372
A man and a woman and a child,
and then the portrait frame is

03e94089-2df5-4a41-8b10-d9c6b8dff2f8-1
01:04:50.372 --> 01:04:55.988
actually being picked up by
somebody and is actually being

03e94089-2df5-4a41-8b10-d9c6b8dff2f8-2
01:04:55.988 --> 01:05:02.080
wrapped up in a cloth. That's a
man who's trying to either give

03e94089-2df5-4a41-8b10-d9c6b8dff2f8-3
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:07.506
it as a gift or take it with him
on a trip because he is

03e94089-2df5-4a41-8b10-d9c6b8dff2f8-4
01:05:07.506 --> 01:05:13.028
carefully wrapping it up in a
string so that the frame is

03e94089-2df5-4a41-8b10-d9c6b8dff2f8-5
01:05:13.028 --> 01:05:13.980
protected.

279f4165-3596-4e4e-bf86-d06db32a2854-0
01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:24.396
It's a picture of of him tying
the bow and also almost kind of

279f4165-3596-4e4e-bf86-d06db32a2854-1
01:05:24.396 --> 01:05:26.890
letting the kind of.

46941abd-ab34-4683-b7dc-9e1e7ea92ffb-0
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:33.332
I'm not saying goodbye to the
frame because there's an image

46941abd-ab34-4683-b7dc-9e1e7ea92ffb-1
01:05:33.332 --> 01:05:38.528
of him just holding wrapped up
portrait and then he is, yeah, I

46941abd-ab34-4683-b7dc-9e1e7ea92ffb-2
01:05:38.528 --> 01:05:43.887
guess he's putting in a suitcase
because the next image is of him

46941abd-ab34-4683-b7dc-9e1e7ea92ffb-3
01:05:43.887 --> 01:05:49.083
opening up a suitcase and then
he is closing the suitcase belt.

46941abd-ab34-4683-b7dc-9e1e7ea92ffb-4
01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:54.036
And once again, he is actually
almost like saying goodbye to

46941abd-ab34-4683-b7dc-9e1e7ea92ffb-5
01:05:54.036 --> 01:05:59.069
either the picture frame and as
you as he starts his journey.

36d9f766-8e5e-4a58-b533-8b34497b32eb-0
01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:06.420
Um, the window seal

db0f7266-58d7-4cee-8e72-20fff41e190f-0
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:13.275
The one on the right side of the
image shows a bigger picture of

db0f7266-58d7-4cee-8e72-20fff41e190f-1
01:06:13.275 --> 01:06:18.578
the whole scene that takes place
in the kitchen. It's the image

db0f7266-58d7-4cee-8e72-20fff41e190f-2
01:06:18.578 --> 01:06:20.070
of the man who is.

14b3099a-9842-41c0-bad8-2816acb7ed10-0
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:26.141
I think he's the man who was
wrapping the portrait and he's

14b3099a-9842-41c0-bad8-2816acb7ed10-1
01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:30.020
standing with a woman who's
holding his hand almost.

1be4f298-fef0-4ec7-a0a0-36ccb4e755ad-0
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.350
And as a way of comfort.

829a34d5-d331-4f34-beb7-df8b09eddb6c-0
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:39.402
Um, and then to the left side
are images of each item that is

829a34d5-d331-4f34-beb7-df8b09eddb6c-1
01:06:39.402 --> 01:06:41.520
on the on the kitchen

1fb1a11f-dfb8-4702-9dec-193685c1fb0e-0
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.660
Shelf above either the oven or a
stove.

3cfa67c6-e8f8-4d95-8f5d-17814feaf44e-0
01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:53.600
The first one is a an origami
crane.

e9fa100a-a952-41b1-aee5-9d53874340b4-0
01:06:55.130 --> 01:07:00.421
The second one is a clock that
shows that the time was 10 after

e9fa100a-a952-41b1-aee5-9d53874340b4-1
01:07:00.421 --> 01:07:00.670
10.

ba236d72-4fc1-4973-8d19-908f3381727e-0
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:08.106
This one is actually under the
shelving, which is the image of

ba236d72-4fc1-4973-8d19-908f3381727e-1
01:07:08.106 --> 01:07:11.750
a cough and a kitchen cloth and
a hat.

6ad98ce3-11fb-4eeb-994e-c3979f414157-0
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:13.860
the

0bf1bb3d-5b1f-44b9-8ab8-4c6b42fa01be-0
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.443
The fourth image is of this of a
used pot and A and a spoon. A

0bf1bb3d-5b1f-44b9-8ab8-4c6b42fa01be-1
01:07:20.443 --> 01:07:25.288
wooden spoon that hasn't been
cleaned up yet, so it looks as

0bf1bb3d-5b1f-44b9-8ab8-4c6b42fa01be-2
01:07:25.288 --> 01:07:27.830
though they just finished lunch.

bb5a4ad5-dc45-4da1-9f82-205f07ca210e-0
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:34.920
And there's an image of a of a
drawing that has been done by

bb5a4ad5-dc45-4da1-9f82-205f07ca210e-1
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:40.687
either a child showing a happier
portrait of a man, a woman and a

bb5a4ad5-dc45-4da1-9f82-205f07ca210e-2
01:07:40.687 --> 01:07:46.279
child with a bird on the man's
shoulder. And there's a sunshine

bb5a4ad5-dc45-4da1-9f82-205f07ca210e-3
01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:51.260
and corner and birds flying. So
it's a very happy image.

e1bafebd-23de-4905-8ad1-e0dd52d3a944-0
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:57.989
There's a pot of hot, either tea
or coffee. You can see that it's

e1bafebd-23de-4905-8ad1-e0dd52d3a944-1
01:07:57.989 --> 01:08:03.069
hot because there's steam still
coming from the pot. The pot is

e1bafebd-23de-4905-8ad1-e0dd52d3a944-2
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:04.340
a well used pot.

9549035c-505f-4e5d-8775-4f999afd4578-0
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.066
That has a crack, but it's still
usable. And then there's an

9549035c-505f-4e5d-8775-4f999afd4578-1
01:08:11.066 --> 01:08:15.869
image of a coffee cup or a
teacup with either postcards or

9549035c-505f-4e5d-8775-4f999afd4578-2
01:08:15.869 --> 01:08:19.369
a train ticket or a some kind of
a ticket.

4538c47e-d6e3-4d40-9f35-77b8492acfd0-0
01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:26.837
And then the corner image of the
picture frame that has been

4538c47e-d6e3-4d40-9f35-77b8492acfd0-1
01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:31.442
placed at the top of the
suitcase. And I think this is

4538c47e-d6e3-4d40-9f35-77b8492acfd0-2
01:08:31.442 --> 01:08:36.884
once again the image of the man
and the woman and the girl. It's

4538c47e-d6e3-4d40-9f35-77b8492acfd0-3
01:08:36.884 --> 01:08:41.907
a portrait. I can't remember if
this is the actual portrait

4538c47e-d6e3-4d40-9f35-77b8492acfd0-4
01:08:41.907 --> 01:08:47.349
picture that the man wrapped up,
but it looks as though it's his

4538c47e-d6e3-4d40-9f35-77b8492acfd0-5
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:50.280
picture with the woman that he
is.

937ce022-4a9a-44e2-8ae6-6ae8abe93755-0
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:54.465
In the kitchen with and there is
no picture of the child in this

937ce022-4a9a-44e2-8ae6-6ae8abe93755-1
01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:54.810
frame.

de169755-2b89-4991-8971-a0d00b7971b6-0
01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.970
Ohkay, the child is here. The
child has to wake up. She's

de169755-2b89-4991-8971-a0d00b7971b6-1
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:03.990
still in bed.

782557fc-6c4f-40ca-b1fb-0e4530fa19bd-0
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.020
So I guess that 10 after 10 is a
night image.

f0e2fca8-ab91-4544-9db2-b7679d62c84d-0
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:15.397
The girl was asleep, but she's
been awakened. She's yawning

f0e2fca8-ab91-4544-9db2-b7679d62c84d-1
01:09:15.397 --> 01:09:20.159
because it's she was fast
asleep. She's been given a bowl

f0e2fca8-ab91-4544-9db2-b7679d62c84d-2
01:09:20.159 --> 01:09:25.004
of Stew or cereal to eat and she
looks like she is looking

f0e2fca8-ab91-4544-9db2-b7679d62c84d-3
01:09:25.004 --> 01:09:30.096
talking to somebody. And then
there's an image of her looking

f0e2fca8-ab91-4544-9db2-b7679d62c84d-4
01:09:30.096 --> 01:09:31.410
at the suitcase.

e260674f-7cbb-4bf3-90c4-98bbb81a4a59-0
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.635
An image in the suitcase already
prepared. The man is about to

e260674f-7cbb-4bf3-90c4-98bbb81a4a59-1
01:09:37.635 --> 01:09:41.844
put on his hat. The woman is
about to put on her scarf.

e260674f-7cbb-4bf3-90c4-98bbb81a4a59-2
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:46.429
They're getting ready to leave
the home girl is being helped

e260674f-7cbb-4bf3-90c4-98bbb81a4a59-3
01:09:46.429 --> 01:09:50.788
dress with a hat and put on
shoes. She tries to carry the

e260674f-7cbb-4bf3-90c4-98bbb81a4a59-4
01:09:50.788 --> 01:09:55.373
suitcase, but the the man says
no, I'll carry it. And so the

e260674f-7cbb-4bf3-90c4-98bbb81a4a59-5
01:09:55.373 --> 01:09:58.230
last image is really of of the
three.

c488c3a9-fa88-44f3-8cda-8d97b1573c6d-0
01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:05.803
That's a family of three leaving
what I assume to be their house

c488c3a9-fa88-44f3-8cda-8d97b1573c6d-1
01:10:05.803 --> 01:10:10.660
with an with a night image of a
tale of a dragon.

339db5e3-cc55-48f0-89f7-3243257c8b75-0
01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:20.552
The girl is looking up. The girl
is looking distant and she was

339db5e3-cc55-48f0-89f7-3243257c8b75-1
01:10:20.552 --> 01:10:26.444
then walking with both her, her
hand held by either the man and

339db5e3-cc55-48f0-89f7-3243257c8b75-2
01:10:26.444 --> 01:10:32.429
the woman. They're going towards
the train station because there

339db5e3-cc55-48f0-89f7-3243257c8b75-3
01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:36.480
is a train that is coming into
the station.

dde83eb5-d905-49f9-abaf-bf14b4ecbc42-0
01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:40.300
It looks as though.

a8d668dc-f4de-424d-841e-88b1c72eca30-0
01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:47.130
The girl is talking to the man.
The man had put the paper

36ff2f74-e49d-47e8-953e-743d5ff41203-0
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:54.511
Bird in his hat as a way of as
entertaining the girl. He lifts

36ff2f74-e49d-47e8-953e-743d5ff41203-1
01:10:54.511 --> 01:10:58.060
his hat to show the girl the the
paper

09b9be93-e6b0-4d04-8c36-1b55b2877702-0
01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:06.399
Bird. She holds the paper bird.
He's telling her that, you know,

09b9be93-e6b0-4d04-8c36-1b55b2877702-1
01:11:06.399 --> 01:11:12.546
remember to to keep paper bird
with her at all times. He and

09b9be93-e6b0-4d04-8c36-1b55b2877702-2
01:11:12.546 --> 01:11:18.491
she hug. She is looking at the
mother, who is actually the

09b9be93-e6b0-4d04-8c36-1b55b2877702-3
01:11:18.491 --> 01:11:24.336
mother of the woman who was
crying because she is dabbing

09b9be93-e6b0-4d04-8c36-1b55b2877702-4
01:11:24.336 --> 01:11:30.080
the handkerchief to her eyes.
She then embraces the man.

2d601c37-3db7-4978-8416-19ed3b71ba32-0
01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:36.790
She holds the same handkerchief
and he whispers in her ears

2d601c37-3db7-4978-8416-19ed3b71ba32-1
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:42.700
words of comfort as she is
looking down, looking sad and

2d601c37-3db7-4978-8416-19ed3b71ba32-2
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:49.439
distressed. He is about to board
the train, so he's the one that

2d601c37-3db7-4978-8416-19ed3b71ba32-3
01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:55.970
is journeying away. There's an
image of the hand of the mother

2d601c37-3db7-4978-8416-19ed3b71ba32-4
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:58.769
or the woman and the child.

43355969-8597-4ee3-ba1b-27611a9fae88-0
01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.885
With the image of the man's hand
and as it leaves, the train is

43355969-8597-4ee3-ba1b-27611a9fae88-1
01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:10.351
actually departing and runs off
into the distance. All of these

43355969-8597-4ee3-ba1b-27611a9fae88-2
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:15.389
images are in a black. It's not
black and white, but it's.

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:21.080
You know monochrome image.

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:32.556
It looks as though he's going
further away. The picture of the

7152d06c-1080-4f17-a34e-3d2409483fa0-1
01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:38.256
portrait is very much with him
as he's having a bowl of soup

7152d06c-1080-4f17-a34e-3d2409483fa0-2
01:12:38.256 --> 01:12:44.143
and he places the portrait of
the family on a suitcase as he's

7152d06c-1080-4f17-a34e-3d2409483fa0-3
01:12:44.143 --> 01:12:47.320
having his meal and as the
frame.

1fdc8bc1-5252-43fb-8f49-7dc984dfeffc-0
01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:54.116
Of the camera or the image goes
out it it shows that he is

1fdc8bc1-5252-43fb-8f49-7dc984dfeffc-1
01:12:54.116 --> 01:12:58.860
actually in the lower part of a
large cruise ship because it's a

1fdc8bc1-5252-43fb-8f49-7dc984dfeffc-2
01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:03.459
picture of him in the window and
the window is getting smaller

1fdc8bc1-5252-43fb-8f49-7dc984dfeffc-3
01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:06.159
and smaller and smaller and
smaller.

c2736714-6cb4-4e75-8f61-c27d1c57a8ef-0
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.605
#END_arrival-1 That shows that
it is a large cruise ship,

c2736714-6cb4-4e75-8f61-c27d1c57a8ef-1
01:13:11.605 --> 01:13:14.930
probably sailing to place very
far away, OK.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.930
{That is all that I want to do.}
