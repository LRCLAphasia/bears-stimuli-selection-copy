00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.077
We will use two types of
pictures for eliciting or

20514222-8f4d-4c9c-b377-66fdae755296-1
00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:14.264
helping you to generate your
words. There will be two types.

20514222-8f4d-4c9c-b377-66fdae755296-2
00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:19.537
The first type that you will see
will be. The first item is a

20514222-8f4d-4c9c-b377-66fdae755296-3
00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:24.640
complex scene. As the name
suggests is a very busy picture.

0b7304bc-ebea-43e1-9ea7-c8ab46310b7d-0
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.076
Imagine that you're describing
it to someone who cannot see it.

0b7304bc-ebea-43e1-9ea7-c8ab46310b7d-1
00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:35.563
Describe what is happening and
what you see as thoroughly as

0b7304bc-ebea-43e1-9ea7-c8ab46310b7d-2
00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:40.269
possible, and take between three
and five minutes in describing

0b7304bc-ebea-43e1-9ea7-c8ab46310b7d-3
00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.799
what you see and what is
happening. OK, OK, so.

9597062a-9f3a-422e-9e64-003aefd1b684-0
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.320
Whenever you're ready.

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-0
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.676
#START_by_the_lake All right. So
there is a lake that is

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-1
00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:58.941
surrounded by a white beach and
there are people, probably about

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-2
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:03.719
1000 people that are all is
participating in various beach

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-3
00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.903
activities. There is boats that
people are riding on that there

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-4
00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:14.086
are kayaks. Someone is in a red
kayak and they're paddling next

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-5
00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:18.703
to someone in a blue kayak.
There's a jet ski with three

78daa8b6-a71c-47ac-b03b-71bec2ca9ecc-6
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:19.270
people.

58b8e910-da5d-4ee5-9e52-aac8a4def3f2-0
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.900
On it.

4da142da-56fd-4e81-9ad6-733485d8cc19-0
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.331
Next to them is a paddle
boarder. There are two paddle

4da142da-56fd-4e81-9ad6-733485d8cc19-1
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.481
boarders and they're near rock
that is separating the three.

4da142da-56fd-4e81-9ad6-733485d8cc19-2
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:30.930
There's another paddle boarder
now.

09e27ff4-8342-4253-b88a-34115b9e9c06-0
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.106
And then there is a dragon boat.
The Dragon boat has about 15 to

09e27ff4-8342-4253-b88a-34115b9e9c06-1
00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:43.627
20 people. They're all wearing
the same type of blue and white

09e27ff4-8342-4253-b88a-34115b9e9c06-2
00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:47.220
hat it looks like, and a yellow
T-shirt.

217214bc-3989-489e-a3b2-5e2bec8b1307-0
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.493
And then right in front of them
is a person that is appears to

217214bc-3989-489e-a3b2-5e2bec8b1307-1
00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:56.418
be a man in a bathing suit trunk
and he seems to be jumping off

217214bc-3989-489e-a3b2-5e2bec8b1307-2
00:01:56.418 --> 00:02:00.036
of a rock, followed by more
people that are jumping off of

217214bc-3989-489e-a3b2-5e2bec8b1307-3
00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.140
that similar rock.

2b4e3681-5cd0-44b2-bdbb-ff61bdf9dd0a-0
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.255
Behind them there are two people
that are riding bicycles and

2b4e3681-5cd0-44b2-bdbb-ff61bdf9dd0a-1
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:12.180
other people are playing on the
rocks around them. There are

2b4e3681-5cd0-44b2-bdbb-ff61bdf9dd0a-2
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.360
about three to four people.

b5e3a6cf-7844-48c1-95a9-e2d49927bd74-0
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.170
That are sitting and standing on
the rock.

063cf185-d29b-4b40-b6cd-d4c86b389a23-0
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.816
Umm, and there appears to be a
cabin located behind near the

063cf185-d29b-4b40-b6cd-d4c86b389a23-1
00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:28.708
there are several different like
types of buildings. There's a

063cf185-d29b-4b40-b6cd-d4c86b389a23-2
00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:33.755
cabin that a family or group of
people seem to be picnicking at.

063cf185-d29b-4b40-b6cd-d4c86b389a23-3
00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:38.336
There's someone grilling and
someone's drinking something,

063cf185-d29b-4b40-b6cd-d4c86b389a23-4
00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:42.995
and they're all just sitting
around outside next to the red

063cf185-d29b-4b40-b6cd-d4c86b389a23-5
00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:43.850
cooler and.

ca7b0839-b863-4e94-800c-9751f4e400d2-0
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.970
Umm.

920ae453-ed44-4035-a769-3e4bce92e63c-0
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.156
Behind the behind there there's
another building. It appears to

920ae453-ed44-4035-a769-3e4bce92e63c-1
00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:56.335
have two red Spires and it's a
red just a red building. I not

920ae453-ed44-4035-a769-3e4bce92e63c-2
00:02:56.335 --> 00:03:01.264
too sure what that building
would be, but then people seem

920ae453-ed44-4035-a769-3e4bce92e63c-3
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:06.610
to be parasailing in front of it
with rainbow colored parasails

920ae453-ed44-4035-a769-3e4bce92e63c-4
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.780
off of a boat.

e093bdb3-4ed0-46dd-96ad-4ebbf7b7550a-0
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.400
And.

0be58a0a-3302-45c0-94cc-612cb47c3eb1-0
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.951
Lots of other there's a yellow
sail and a red sail as wet as

0be58a0a-3302-45c0-94cc-612cb47c3eb1-1
00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:20.570
well. And then they are all near
a.

edfa9f0d-108d-4282-993b-a27a532eb878-0
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.120
They look like tandems.

64b979aa-b952-49dd-bffb-5161a71b2b8b-0
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.002
Water skiers. There's about like
30 or so people all stacked on

64b979aa-b952-49dd-bffb-5161a71b2b8b-1
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.990
top of each other and red and
yellow.

1cd7a717-eae8-477d-bba4-c6b2adb3d3a2-0
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.640
Umm.

62aaa6e6-c820-43bc-82ff-7a641e58f2aa-0
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.530
Attire. And they're all just
stacked on top of each other,

62aaa6e6-c820-43bc-82ff-7a641e58f2aa-1
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.650
from about 10 people to 8 to 3
to 2 to 1, all in the shape of a

62aaa6e6-c820-43bc-82ff-7a641e58f2aa-2
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.850
pyramid. And they are all water
skiing.

c5a40ed3-a24a-43d9-8161-3738331440d7-0
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.618
And their next to another castle
looking thing that's on the left

c5a40ed3-a24a-43d9-8161-3738331440d7-1
00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:02.624
side of the picture. So far left
as top left I would say and far

c5a40ed3-a24a-43d9-8161-3738331440d7-2
00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:04.749
top left as you can be.

9ef8f00c-5a1e-4c0c-97df-89bc887029df-0
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.868
There's tubing that's going on.
So people are playing in a

9ef8f00c-5a1e-4c0c-97df-89bc887029df-1
00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:19.209
yellow tube and they're right in
front of the 30 or so pyramid

9ef8f00c-5a1e-4c0c-97df-89bc887029df-2
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.450
people and someone looks to be
riding a water motorcycle, so.

d36ff3fd-8e62-4453-82be-5d9ecdbb39f2-0
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.660
I don't know what that is, but
it's got red wheels and

d36ff3fd-8e62-4453-82be-5d9ecdbb39f2-1
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.861
someone's waving and in front of
them there are two people in one

d36ff3fd-8e62-4453-82be-5d9ecdbb39f2-2
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:37.998
of those on those duck boats. It
looks like it's orange, but the

d36ff3fd-8e62-4453-82be-5d9ecdbb39f2-3
00:04:37.998 --> 00:04:42.008
you pedal with your feet, and I
can tell because that person's

d36ff3fd-8e62-4453-82be-5d9ecdbb39f2-4
00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:46.146
feet or his knees are up, so it
looks like he's all scrunched up

d36ff3fd-8e62-4453-82be-5d9ecdbb39f2-5
00:04:46.146 --> 00:04:46.909
in the boat.

6b9a98d5-c0ac-4647-9b56-90764a7e5e07-0
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.781
And then paras, I guess. I don't
know what parasailing exactly

6b9a98d5-c0ac-4647-9b56-90764a7e5e07-1
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:59.520
entails, but they're on those
boats that have.

887de65d-96ac-44b4-a456-bbf8c8b93fba-0
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.845
There is a board and then the
sails that come off and you

887de65d-96ac-44b4-a456-bbf8c8b93fba-1
00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:06.730
hang, you hang on to it.

e5eaedd9-c6f6-48e3-af0e-3cfc722d4fad-0
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.650
That Hang Gliding, sailing, hang
sailing. #END_by_the_lake

fbd62bb6-5ede-40ba-bd45-1c530d31164f-0
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.915
And there's probably a better
specific term. I'm not a very,

fbd62bb6-5ede-40ba-bd45-1c530d31164f-1
00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:20.876
not very good with the the water
terminology. Yeah, OK, so that's

fbd62bb6-5ede-40ba-bd45-1c530d31164f-2
00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:22.680
the first complex scene.

963994ff-de8e-443b-bae1-066120cd7c76-0
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.790
On.

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-0
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.790
OK, the second item is a
different type of pictures that

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-1
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.926
you will see a graphic novel.
Alright, it's a series of

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-2
00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:39.580
pictures that tells a story. So
describe what you see and what

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-3
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.086
is happening as you go through
the story. At most it will be

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-4
00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:48.666
around 30 pages and try to take
between 10 to 15 minutes. I'm

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-5
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:53.541
keeping track of the time as you
go through the story. I'll just,

c70148bc-350c-4ee1-9488-7b6f76f7b153-6
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:56.570
we'll just move along as we look
at the.

876ee948-b81f-43e3-b7d4-4f7baad78798-0
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.820
OK, OK. OK.

40ee693e-82f9-4ff1-a78a-67b6cf58ee69-0
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.880
When you're ready.

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-0
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.095
#START_journey So there is a
girl, and in front of the girl

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-1
00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:16.042
there is a bright red scooter
and she's sitting on the front

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-2
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:20.827
steps of a house, her parent I'm
assuming that they're her

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-3
00:06:20.827 --> 00:06:25.936
parents, that her mom is cooking
in the kitchen right now, and

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-4
00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:30.234
her dad is upstairs reading
something on this on his

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-5
00:06:30.234 --> 00:06:35.424
computer and a sibling of hers
is playing on their phone in the

17648288-ed76-48f7-9f68-101aaccec8f5-6
00:06:35.424 --> 00:06:36.560
room adjacent.

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-0
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.752
To the father. And so this girl
whose name I'm assuming is

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-1
00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:44.844
Josephine, but because the book
says for Josephine, she is

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-2
00:06:44.844 --> 00:06:49.145
sitting on the front steps of
this house in front of this red

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-3
00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:53.653
tricycle. There appears to be a
city in the background. There is

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-4
00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:57.954
a lot of skyscrapers that appear
to be going on. So she looks

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-5
00:06:57.954 --> 00:07:02.323
really sad and really unhappy.
And across from her is a person

8360bd25-e2e2-4644-86cd-9b103b09cbf9-6
00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:05.999
is another little kid and they'd
have a bright pink.

abd1eefd-23ac-4f1a-bf6d-c5d12a7445b1-0
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.258
Marker or some type of writing
utensil, could be chalk and it

abd1eefd-23ac-4f1a-bf6d-c5d12a7445b1-1
00:07:12.258 --> 00:07:17.251
could be some type of brightly
colored pen, but it's bright

abd1eefd-23ac-4f1a-bf6d-c5d12a7445b1-2
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:22.576
pink and they are observing some
of the other kids as they high

abd1eefd-23ac-4f1a-bf6d-c5d12a7445b1-3
00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:24.989
five and ride their bicycles.

1e8618ad-f10a-421e-a5af-6c1388f0b054-0
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.960
Um.

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-0
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.898
So Josephine comes in and she
brings the red scooter inside

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-1
00:07:31.898 --> 00:07:35.617
and she seems to be appearing to
want to play with her mom or

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-2
00:07:35.617 --> 00:07:39.096
observe what her mom is doing.
Her mom is too busy. She's

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-3
00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:42.814
cooking, she cannot. She's on
the phone, she cannot play with

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-4
00:07:42.814 --> 00:07:46.533
Josephine. So she goes upstairs
to her dad's office, but he's

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-5
00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:50.312
still on the computer. He still
doesn't want to play with her.

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-6
00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:54.151
She has a red kite now as well,
and she seems to be offering up

e9893c21-2045-467a-9cbb-5d647a5d272e-7
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.210
all of these solutions of
different games to play.

b3cb1e4e-2813-4717-8704-77d25ac839ce-0
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.790
And then she goes to the
sibling. The sibling is still on

b3cb1e4e-2813-4717-8704-77d25ac839ce-1
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.556
their phone and does not want to
participate in that and Justine

b3cb1e4e-2813-4717-8704-77d25ac839ce-2
00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:09.265
has a red ball now as well. So
she goes back to her room and is

b3cb1e4e-2813-4717-8704-77d25ac839ce-3
00:08:09.265 --> 00:08:12.568
sitting and looks pretty
dejected as she sits on her bed

b3cb1e4e-2813-4717-8704-77d25ac839ce-4
00:08:12.568 --> 00:08:16.102
with a cat and her cat doesn't
want to play any attention to

b3cb1e4e-2813-4717-8704-77d25ac839ce-5
00:08:16.102 --> 00:08:16.740
her either.

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-0
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.822
And then she sees a marker on
the floor. It looks like a

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-1
00:08:23.822 --> 00:08:28.566
bright red marker, similar to
what the little kid outside had.

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-2
00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:32.858
She sees it on the floor. She
goes over and next to that

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-3
00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:37.602
marker and a pile of papers, and
she begins to pick it up. And

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-4
00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:42.045
then she begins to draw an
outline on the door on the wall

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-5
00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:46.864
with that marker. And the marker
appears to be magic because it

5a324609-6cb5-43b2-aee0-e55f25451353-6
00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:48.219
turns into a door.

7171d183-3f0d-47d9-806b-54476f01acc6-0
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.830
And Josephine is able to walk
through.

1f542bea-0722-4be7-9c21-148019709dbd-0
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.802
and once she walks through it.
She is entered into this

1f542bea-0722-4be7-9c21-148019709dbd-1
00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.540
beautiful forest there are.

3081108a-6039-4894-9b1a-16c4fedc9d6a-0
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.532
About 9 or so, blue lanterns in
various intricately covered

3081108a-6039-4894-9b1a-16c4fedc9d6a-1
00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:09.585
designs. And it's this beautiful
woods that is lit with all of

3081108a-6039-4894-9b1a-16c4fedc9d6a-2
00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:11.110
these fairy lights.

6f21d53e-e821-47d7-bdd4-71aa61468741-0
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.295
Very green. There's a lake or a
stream that's running through it

6f21d53e-e821-47d7-bdd4-71aa61468741-1
00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:19.370
and it's just very picturesque
and she's looking up in

6f21d53e-e821-47d7-bdd4-71aa61468741-2
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.930
amazement.

04d43077-ea4d-47be-b8da-ba0b5c14c884-0
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.440
Yeah.

84bebb23-4953-48b6-ab39-d10ff8c96e9b-0
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.516
And so she goes over to cross
the stream. And when she crosses

84bebb23-4953-48b6-ab39-d10ff8c96e9b-1
00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:32.090
the stream, there's bridge. And
the bridge has a bit of an

84bebb23-4953-48b6-ab39-d10ff8c96e9b-2
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.724
opening. And so she's looking
down on it and she's like I'm

84bebb23-4953-48b6-ab39-d10ff8c96e9b-3
00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:39.662
going to draw a boat. And so she
begins to draw on the water and

84bebb23-4953-48b6-ab39-d10ff8c96e9b-4
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:43.478
is able to draw herself a boat,
and she gets into the boat and

84bebb23-4953-48b6-ab39-d10ff8c96e9b-5
00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:44.690
begins to sail away.

c04ca157-fd9f-45da-927d-a4564bb116a6-0
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.689
Oh, and when she gets into the
boat, she sails right into this

c04ca157-fd9f-45da-927d-a4564bb116a6-1
00:09:51.689 --> 00:09:56.601
beautiful magical Kingdom. It is
ginormous. It's has all of these

c04ca157-fd9f-45da-927d-a4564bb116a6-2
00:09:56.601 --> 00:10:00.918
beautiful gold Spires and
everything, and she's coming up

c04ca157-fd9f-45da-927d-a4564bb116a6-3
00:10:00.918 --> 00:10:05.310
towards a drawbridge, it looks
like, or some type of gate.

fbe71ad1-4936-4d97-9087-2bae2e115c08-0
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.143
And she's coming up in her red
boat and she's leaving the

fbe71ad1-4936-4d97-9087-2bae2e115c08-1
00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.250
forest behind?

09590909-e717-46c3-8593-716f046d8f0c-0
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.958
And when she gets through the
drawbridge, there are all of

09590909-e717-46c3-8593-716f046d8f0c-1
00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.055
these guards that are prepared
to meet her, and it looks like

09590909-e717-46c3-8593-716f046d8f0c-2
00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.500
the entire Kingdom is full of
these.

d438f827-9e84-4615-a635-889c149552e0-0
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.339
Aqueducts that are just flowing
and people are sailing their

d438f827-9e84-4615-a635-889c149552e0-1
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.480
boats on them.

d494ea04-6925-4c53-9706-d649f3e5b316-0
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.209
And people are waving her in.
It's got a lot of pulley system

d494ea04-6925-4c53-9706-d649f3e5b316-1
00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:43.010
and so it looks like a city of
aqueducts and water. So she's

d494ea04-6925-4c53-9706-d649f3e5b316-2
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.450
sailing around in her red boat.

7bb19642-4f6a-4c9a-9f7f-65a080ed289b-0
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.600
And being welcomed in and.

fa29965b-707b-43f8-908c-eb3ba38edab8-0
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.689
Then she's looks like she's
gonna go, she looks like she's

fa29965b-707b-43f8-908c-eb3ba38edab8-1
00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:57.269
going to go off a waterfall and
she's like, Oh my God, I don't

fa29965b-707b-43f8-908c-eb3ba38edab8-2
00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:02.067
know right now what I'm going to
do. So she draws a circle as she

fa29965b-707b-43f8-908c-eb3ba38edab8-3
00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:05.630
falls down from her boat as she
goes off of the.

85238bec-b4b3-4c49-a34f-833cd19a2cbe-0
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.590
Off the side of the the
waterfall.

3a7649cb-f4ec-450e-8526-23a9f03043af-0
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.230
And starts to draw a circle.

d380f0ba-70a0-4a20-9b35-11bc7d121564-0
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.968
And she ends up drawing a hot
air balloon and says sailing

d380f0ba-70a0-4a20-9b35-11bc7d121564-1
00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:24.649
away. And as she's failing up
towards the sky, she sees a

d380f0ba-70a0-4a20-9b35-11bc7d121564-2
00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:30.526
she's waving goodbye, and she
sees a little fortress in the

d380f0ba-70a0-4a20-9b35-11bc7d121564-3
00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:31.800
sky of these.

c530fe43-aae0-405a-b936-87d59e4ea9fd-0
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.066
Ohh man, they're like they had.
They're powered by these

c530fe43-aae0-405a-b936-87d59e4ea9fd-1
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:41.436
windmills and there seems to be
a lot of them up there and so

c530fe43-aae0-405a-b936-87d59e4ea9fd-2
00:11:41.436 --> 00:11:44.959
she's floating towards that the
New Sky fortress.

f676379d-f5b5-404e-9d38-783f0f982e76-0
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.378
And when she gets there, she
sees people are trying to, like,

f676379d-f5b5-404e-9d38-783f0f982e76-1
00:11:50.378 --> 00:11:52.520
catch birds they're all
surrounded with.

f06d0ffc-1845-4f62-b6a4-7036f86250ab-0
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.170
All of these different types of.

873e1b7b-ab54-4f7b-87a9-a0dad2353568-0
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.844
Basically she goes and she sees
all of these people that are

873e1b7b-ab54-4f7b-87a9-a0dad2353568-1
00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:06.630
catching these birds and they're
flying around in their

6b1e7701-7c3f-448b-83e6-21a7091992dd-0
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.940
Windmill types of.

b47d52e4-64d8-4536-9c7a-a81d9a3a6a53-0
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.040
It's.

3622084f-c883-4e23-b87f-84d46ff02829-0
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.100
Ah.

d380c9a1-b94e-4e9e-ae8a-e57391524b6e-0
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.751
Flying contraptions and she's
looking down and she's seeing

d380c9a1-b94e-4e9e-ae8a-e57391524b6e-1
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:24.078
them and observing them as she
does below and it's looks to be

d380c9a1-b94e-4e9e-ae8a-e57391524b6e-2
00:12:24.078 --> 00:12:25.590
another fortress area.

e7ae94ef-87f7-4d8d-9a3a-c1dea2201183-0
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.160
So she thinks I'm gonna land on
it. And this.

b3c50bcb-9f20-4dae-9281-677757990a30-0
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.630
This is big.

f918bdf5-4b56-4e64-8116-20267365ca66-0
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.341
Flying spaceship and it seems to
be it's not spaceship, but it's

f918bdf5-4b56-4e64-8116-20267365ca66-1
00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:42.780
a windmill. It's a.

e4f9542b-28dd-41ae-82cf-b1bf73a5e094-0
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.297
The words fail me. It's got
gold. It's got a dragon type of

e4f9542b-28dd-41ae-82cf-b1bf73a5e094-1
00:12:52.297 --> 00:12:58.102
design on it and it looks very
regal. It looks like something

e4f9542b-28dd-41ae-82cf-b1bf73a5e094-2
00:12:58.102 --> 00:13:02.690
that it is. It seems to be
powered by a various.

fd49167d-cf44-42a2-be2d-8fa2737a49b8-0
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.750
Umm.

8dded884-bec5-41fd-a39d-c4f4501303ad-0
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.445
Engines, there's smoke that's
coming out of the pillar. So

8dded884-bec5-41fd-a39d-c4f4501303ad-1
00:13:10.445 --> 00:13:15.419
there seems to be like very
fancy and also rudimentary

8dded884-bec5-41fd-a39d-c4f4501303ad-2
00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:17.590
airplanes. And so, yeah.

36d37f46-0785-4cd4-bce2-ce5e2c41e3bb-0
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.000
Um and she sees that inside this
gold contraption is the pink

36d37f46-0785-4cd4-bce2-ce5e2c41e3bb-1
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.921
bird that they were trying to
catch earlier. And so she lands

36d37f46-0785-4cd4-bce2-ce5e2c41e3bb-2
00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:37.890
on the ship and she she starts
following them up.

96d023b7-bec1-4868-8875-4941d49acbbc-0
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.954
And on that gold contraption
there is a beautiful pink bird

96d023b7-bec1-4868-8875-4941d49acbbc-1
00:13:42.954 --> 00:13:47.239
that is being held and guarded.
And so she sneaks on up and

96d023b7-bec1-4868-8875-4941d49acbbc-2
00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:51.667
she's climbing up the ladder
because she's going to go take a

96d023b7-bec1-4868-8875-4941d49acbbc-3
00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:54.310
better look and see what's going
on.

746273ab-c4bd-48ec-bfad-b4a903205489-0
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.145
And so she steals the bird and
the guards, they're aghast,

746273ab-c4bd-48ec-bfad-b4a903205489-1
00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:05.340
they're just shocked. And as
she's running down, all of the

746273ab-c4bd-48ec-bfad-b4a903205489-2
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.535
guards are chasing down her
youth. We see into the ship and

746273ab-c4bd-48ec-bfad-b4a903205489-3
00:14:09.535 --> 00:14:13.939
she's just running. She's she's
beat all the guards. There's a

746273ab-c4bd-48ec-bfad-b4a903205489-4
00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:17.924
frenzy, they are all frantic to
catch this bird, and she

746273ab-c4bd-48ec-bfad-b4a903205489-5
00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:22.050
releases this bird back into the
world, back into the sky.

449f0849-26a6-438c-89e1-6cd689f164a5-0
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:30.306
And so the guards finally catch
her and the person who I'm

449f0849-26a6-438c-89e1-6cd689f164a5-1
00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:34.763
assuming is the head guard is
furious and he takes her red

449f0849-26a6-438c-89e1-6cd689f164a5-2
00:14:34.763 --> 00:14:39.748
marker, and he's her special red
marker, he drops it off the side

449f0849-26a6-438c-89e1-6cd689f164a5-3
00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:44.356
of the floating ship so they
have her held captive. He takes

449f0849-26a6-438c-89e1-6cd689f164a5-4
00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:49.115
her red marker and he throws it
off the side and they imprison

449f0849-26a6-438c-89e1-6cd689f164a5-5
00:14:49.115 --> 00:14:53.270
her in a floating bird cage. But
it takes you in Cage.

7add6d4e-a4ef-4f23-b3dd-c81eeb799ccc-0
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.526
But it it resembles very closely
the bird cage at the bird

7add6d4e-a4ef-4f23-b3dd-c81eeb799ccc-1
00:14:57.526 --> 00:15:01.340
within, and they begin to lower
her below the flight.

0bcd64d9-d281-4b40-9888-b4a2ec0e525e-0
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.515
And the bird remembers that she
freed it, and it brings back the

0bcd64d9-d281-4b40-9888-b4a2ec0e525e-1
00:15:09.515 --> 00:15:13.997
pink, the the red marker. And
this bird is bright pink. And

0bcd64d9-d281-4b40-9888-b4a2ec0e525e-2
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:18.405
Josephine sees it as dusk is
coming on, and she's thrilled

0bcd64d9-d281-4b40-9888-b4a2ec0e525e-3
00:15:18.405 --> 00:15:23.111
because she's going to be able
to get out. And so she she sits

0bcd64d9-d281-4b40-9888-b4a2ec0e525e-4
00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:27.892
down, back in her cage with the
bird and begins to draw several

0bcd64d9-d281-4b40-9888-b4a2ec0e525e-5
00:15:27.892 --> 00:15:32.150
lines that are beginning to
resemble assuming an escape.

ddea213b-7b76-4f1e-9b2c-5968eeca9531-0
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.540
For Josephine.

1fd5ab9c-90f3-4e20-b7d6-e65fed5465de-0
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:42.256
But it's not. It is an escape.
It is a magic carpet. It's a red

1fd5ab9c-90f3-4e20-b7d6-e65fed5465de-1
00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:47.212
carpet. And she and the pink
bird, they leave the cage, the

1fd5ab9c-90f3-4e20-b7d6-e65fed5465de-2
00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:52.499
bloating bird cage, and they fly
across the city and people are

1fd5ab9c-90f3-4e20-b7d6-e65fed5465de-3
00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:57.620
looking up and it looks to be a
different type of city. There

1fd5ab9c-90f3-4e20-b7d6-e65fed5465de-4
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.576
seems to be palm trees that I
didn't notice were present in

1fd5ab9c-90f3-4e20-b7d6-e65fed5465de-5
00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:05.220
the other in our other kingdoms.

b87ab707-d8ca-481c-bc9b-6bb8f923b3d0-0
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.838
This is a different Kingdom and
it looks like she and the bird

b87ab707-d8ca-481c-bc9b-6bb8f923b3d0-1
00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:13.896
are escaping together and this
as dusk comes into the city and

b87ab707-d8ca-481c-bc9b-6bb8f923b3d0-2
00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:15.700
everybody starts to wake up.

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-0
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.497
And then nightfall, or I guess
it is. Yeah, it is dawn or dusk.

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-1
00:16:21.497 --> 00:16:26.104
Yeah. And so it's nightfall is
coming upon us now. And they are

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-2
00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:30.568
flying and they're flying across
and they're stars all in the

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-3
00:16:30.568 --> 00:16:35.103
sky. And she's able to see it as
she flies into the desert. We

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-4
00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:39.566
can see that we're leaving the
Kingdom because the Kingdom is

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-5
00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:44.318
now to the far left of the page.
It's far behind us. And so we're

c0886158-0920-4d1f-acd3-ba38ed624719-6
00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:45.470
now flying away.

5cf1b0b6-6b3a-4c4f-981e-1e8e9c28d98a-0
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.564
And so she gets to the base of a
palm tree. It's a single palm

5cf1b0b6-6b3a-4c4f-981e-1e8e9c28d98a-1
00:16:54.564 --> 00:16:55.140
tree in.

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-0
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.443
This desert and the bird. The
pink bird has a little pink door

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-1
00:17:02.443 --> 00:17:07.407
and it's standing next to there,
almost gesturing Josephine to

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-2
00:17:07.407 --> 00:17:11.976
come over and come inside. And
so Josephine takes her red

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-3
00:17:11.976 --> 00:17:16.388
marker. She leaves behind the
magic carpet and she goes

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-4
00:17:16.388 --> 00:17:21.431
inside. She goes to open up the
door and first. So she opens up

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-5
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:26.316
the door and the bird flies in
and she follows suit into this

3d260abf-c985-4caf-ae6c-a455a4a81ed0-6
00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:26.710
home.

93b0f936-57fb-4256-ab33-290a1ff7e3ca-0
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.340
Tree.

15406dc7-97eb-44d9-884e-8c5ac8875994-0
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.450
Little home.

c9be9649-32c6-4e25-acf0-2f50025bdd76-0
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.713
And when she comes out, the bird
flies immediately to the child

c9be9649-32c6-4e25-acf0-2f50025bdd76-1
00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:44.947
that was carrying the red, the
pink marker, earlier. And so she

c9be9649-32c6-4e25-acf0-2f50025bdd76-2
00:17:44.947 --> 00:17:47.870
comes out in this mailbox and.

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-0
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:54.019
The bird flies immediately to
that kid with the pink marker,

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-1
00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:58.846
and the bird seems to be owned
by this child perches right on

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-2
00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:03.751
his arm. And then his shoulder
has Josephine displays that she

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-3
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:08.656
has a magical red marker that
draws, and he also displays that

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-4
00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:13.172
he has magical pink marker that
draws. And so the bird is

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-5
00:18:13.172 --> 00:18:18.077
clearly his pink bird and she
and they both clearly have these

6144a580-0eb9-4453-8700-2098596be366-6
00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:18.700
magical.

8cf78da0-df65-4f64-846e-0f17448fa542-0
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.250
Markers. She has her red one and
he's got his pink one.

7ee407dc-f08b-419e-8c68-2a702ccbc610-0
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.584
And so they take they, they draw
their circles and they create a

7ee407dc-f08b-419e-8c68-2a702ccbc610-1
00:18:32.584 --> 00:18:37.545
tandem bike out of it. And as
they start to get on, as they

7ee407dc-f08b-419e-8c68-2a702ccbc610-2
00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:42.588
get on the bike, the bird, this
child with the pink marker's

7ee407dc-f08b-419e-8c68-2a702ccbc610-3
00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:47.384
bird, he is flying behind them.
And Josephine finally has

7ee407dc-f08b-419e-8c68-2a702ccbc610-4
00:18:47.384 --> 00:18:52.675
someone to play with because he
has found somebody that matches

7ee407dc-f08b-419e-8c68-2a702ccbc610-5
00:18:52.675 --> 00:18:54.660
her type of imagination.

8b842cbd-e8fb-417e-b4ba-87b8ee2e0ede-0
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.560
And had that same type of.

b627d4da-21cd-434a-a07a-aabcf25d4603-0
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:58.240
Little marker. #END_journey

c2eea3b7-c0e9-4e14-bec6-9c9e37510da7-0
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.630
Yeah, that was the story. That
was great.

2239130e-4191-465a-8c83-9affeb2757bb-0
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.360
OK. So moving on to the next
item.

f184cf71-5779-4006-b4ac-0b921226d12c-0
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.500
It is again a graphic novel.

88166385-335b-4644-84fa-aacad8b34d5f-0
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.765
Story so describe what you see
and what is happening as you go

88166385-335b-4644-84fa-aacad8b34d5f-1
00:19:15.765 --> 00:19:16.460
through it.

bf1a5383-c0cf-4e3b-947e-c6cf3fc1239f-0
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.980
Feel bad?

7845c3cf-ed01-43ad-9de4-c7566ed8ba78-0
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.781
#START_arrival_2 So we start
with three women and their heads

7845c3cf-ed01-43ad-9de4-c7566ed8ba78-1
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:29.446
are covered in shrouds, they are
in long dresses with long

7845c3cf-ed01-43ad-9de4-c7566ed8ba78-2
00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:33.320
sleeves, and their heads are
covered with these.

ea913ee0-3d25-46f2-b012-f454c02dbd44-0
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.378
White shrouds and next to them
there appear to all be on a

ea913ee0-3d25-46f2-b012-f454c02dbd44-1
00:19:40.378 --> 00:19:45.450
boat. There are ropes behind
them. These men are in hats.

733ea9c0-cc28-4702-8c74-763d57731f95-0
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.770
Pageboy hats and long coats.

27a64e60-2674-459d-931f-4c0dbdfce595-0
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.650
And there's luggage around them,
all around them and so.

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-0
00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:01.277
They're all seem to be on a
voyage somewhere. This woman is

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-1
00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:06.024
holding a baby, and her hair is
wrapped up, and behind her

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-2
00:20:06.024 --> 00:20:10.771
there's a man, also in a long
coat. And so they're they're

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-3
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:15.759
clearly on a voyage somewhere.
And sitting on his suitcase is

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-4
00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:20.426
the man. He's writing in his
journal. He's writing in his

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-5
00:20:20.426 --> 00:20:25.736
journal. And as he begins to rip
out the pages of the journal, he

ad530ee1-8a9b-462d-ac40-2f2f464c365d-6
00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:26.299
begins.

3e267c41-5791-43a4-b0fc-99105e0910b1-0
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.336
Make swan. So he starts to rip
off the pages of the journal

3e267c41-5791-43a4-b0fc-99105e0910b1-1
00:20:31.336 --> 00:20:35.450
that he's writing in, and he
says make Swans and.

3dc55529-b209-475b-b9f4-fed71235cd73-0
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.890
He's holding it up and this one
flies away.

0bbfef96-bfe7-49f9-99cc-bc35330cbc1f-0
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.560
And then?

fe6c9482-ac59-4e65-aefa-5f01cca314cb-0
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.336
So then as he, he watches the
swan fly away and he's looking

fe6c9482-ac59-4e65-aefa-5f01cca314cb-1
00:20:47.336 --> 00:20:48.990
around for it because.

f7cf287d-0de5-492a-8370-23c2aa7ec612-0
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.778
He thinks that that is so
bizarre that this one would fly

f7cf287d-0de5-492a-8370-23c2aa7ec612-1
00:20:53.778 --> 00:20:54.110
away.

8963593e-6ac5-48b2-9036-891b19325f26-0
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.460
and he's looking and he's
looking.

04bc125b-7eaf-4a9d-a839-524fde4cb986-0
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.520
And he looks up.

4c63d508-e9ad-4b7a-a4b0-39360ba5672b-0
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.160
And they're all of these white
birds that are above him.

b7542889-edaf-45ce-8ade-6ded56deb082-0
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.840
And everybody is on the boat is
so ecstatic because they're

b7542889-edaf-45ce-8ade-6ded56deb082-1
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.808
like, oh, look at all the white
birds. They've looked to be all

b7542889-edaf-45ce-8ade-6ded56deb082-2
00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:15.590
going together and migrating,
just like we're all migrating.

10d1950f-3149-434f-818e-09bf65ad8d5c-0
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:17.740
And.

d48dc435-c92d-431f-81bc-2f131799d2f4-0
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.070
Yeah.

ffa9887a-8a2e-4d82-a149-5e28d327d47f-0
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.540
{And should I do longer than
that?

5e4648c8-2dea-483a-bf46-b76e94bed8c4-0
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:29.040
OK, it was good.} And then they
as they pull up them.

f3398bb3-893d-4033-8394-1fb1f1c3fa03-0
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.670
They see these.

bd8a105a-c9b6-4df5-892d-1755c3cd9f0a-0
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.210
Big statues.

e395151d-aa29-4513-8f9e-fe746f3801ef-0
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.070
Of.

58011e63-8d7a-4ac0-bab3-94df589517ce-0
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.060
A of two people, one with a.

66b47add-f8e0-47b7-8fc7-25f2a5cffe73-0
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.570
Rabbit type of

73650c5e-710e-4d7a-ac0b-16d3291853a4-0
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.916
Creature, it's like a squirrel
with long ears and a really long

73650c5e-710e-4d7a-ac0b-16d3291853a4-1
00:21:49.916 --> 00:21:54.421
tail, and another person that
has. There's these statues of

73650c5e-710e-4d7a-ac0b-16d3291853a4-2
00:21:54.421 --> 00:21:58.626
these two people, one has a
lemur type of thing and the

73650c5e-710e-4d7a-ac0b-16d3291853a4-3
00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:03.282
other person has a bird on their
shoulder and they're shaking

73650c5e-710e-4d7a-ac0b-16d3291853a4-4
00:22:03.282 --> 00:22:05.010
hands and next to them.

284dc5ea-5464-4611-af0e-6d99e761c8c6-0
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.440
Are these two boats

a56de078-6010-4e4f-b8c2-24ae44c23a1b-0
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.400
That are also statues that are
filled with.

e0d06bf8-fd2b-4dba-8cd5-8c06f80acd3c-0
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.379
Suitcase, teacups, various
different types of utilities for

e0d06bf8-fd2b-4dba-8cd5-8c06f80acd3c-1
00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:22.941
there's an egg on a vase, and
then on the other ship that

e0d06bf8-fd2b-4dba-8cd5-8c06f80acd3c-2
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:27.110
there is, there there is a tea
kettle, and there is.

0e43ea9e-a642-4023-ba77-58ac38d29bc1-0
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.630
A pot of some sort and they seem
to be placed in.

4f536d48-11dc-4ed5-a49a-fe5a1f3ae3c8-0
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.138
The water as almost a gate into
this city that these people seem

4f536d48-11dc-4ed5-a49a-fe5a1f3ae3c8-1
00:22:37.138 --> 00:22:40.496
to be migrating into. They're
all coming in on all these

4f536d48-11dc-4ed5-a49a-fe5a1f3ae3c8-2
00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:40.849
boats.

563b8fdb-6758-499e-9a64-d4226cc16bf1-0
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.743
And there are several different
types of boats seem to all be

563b8fdb-6758-499e-9a64-d4226cc16bf1-1
00:22:46.743 --> 00:22:48.930
coming into this city and so.

4f2c5cdd-cdd4-4d94-98db-294f9a89d79b-0
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.664
People are looking at these
statues and they're wondering

4f2c5cdd-cdd4-4d94-98db-294f9a89d79b-1
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:54.480
what's going on.

c7127af0-c660-43ab-a9ab-ed92c90799e3-0
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.386
So as the boat pulls up to the
shore, people start to get a

c7127af0-c660-43ab-a9ab-ed92c90799e3-1
00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:07.242
little nervous about what's
going to happen. People There's

c7127af0-c660-43ab-a9ab-ed92c90799e3-2
00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:12.098
someone with a megaphone, it's
um bud megaphone it's pretty

c7127af0-c660-43ab-a9ab-ed92c90799e3-3
00:23:12.098 --> 00:23:13.070
rudimentary.

4eb96618-2367-4e41-a871-e53e9dcbf5fb-0
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.623
Just a horn and he's speaking in
and he's saying like I'm

4eb96618-2367-4e41-a871-e53e9dcbf5fb-1
00:23:18.623 --> 00:23:22.110
assuming, directing people on
where to go.

a5ae1a2c-3189-4fa5-85be-589d7e166428-0
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.502
And so they unlock the doors to
the boat and everybody's

a5ae1a2c-3189-4fa5-85be-589d7e166428-1
00:23:26.502 --> 00:23:30.649
grabbing at their suitcases and
they start to file out into the

a5ae1a2c-3189-4fa5-85be-589d7e166428-2
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:31.880
line onto the city.

ea38068b-98e7-40b5-ae63-8bb43179561a-0
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.497
land to the city, and they're
forming a line and they're all

ea38068b-98e7-40b5-ae63-8bb43179561a-1
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:38.260
coming out of the boat and
they're all getting into this

ea38068b-98e7-40b5-ae63-8bb43179561a-2
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.490
city, and so they're all making
a line there.

1c3617a8-3397-4114-a8a1-65e7ea50bd7f-0
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.532
All of these people just from
this really big line with all of

1c3617a8-3397-4114-a8a1-65e7ea50bd7f-1
00:23:45.532 --> 00:23:50.004
their bags and everything, and
there's families kind of huddled

1c3617a8-3397-4114-a8a1-65e7ea50bd7f-2
00:23:50.004 --> 00:23:52.730
together, so it definitely looks
like.

0cd928ac-cfd9-4010-8b9d-2bbbec1940ce-0
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.370
The TSA line at the airport now.

a95b0f7d-7097-4c1f-b84b-f14e3924a3a7-0
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.155
OK. That was the part of the
story that you just described

a95b0f7d-7097-4c1f-b84b-f14e3924a3a7-1
00:24:05.155 --> 00:24:08.200
and we now move on to the next
item.

c0067630-d459-45bc-82f7-63cb358c2069-0
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:14.188
It's a complex scene, so it's a
busy complex scene. Just

c0067630-d459-45bc-82f7-63cb358c2069-1
00:24:14.188 --> 00:24:17.850
describe what you see and what
is happening.

82df840a-e7f5-4b8d-af71-9e27add215a9-0
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.650
In as many details as you can,
OK.

d4846fe6-d15a-434c-a1aa-6b796dbd1c16-0
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.932
#START_dinasours_spacemen_and_ghouls
So this appears to be a picture

d4846fe6-d15a-434c-a1aa-6b796dbd1c16-1
00:24:28.932 --> 00:24:29.090
of.

40e80cc7-a87d-4924-b03f-e90f2b3f6989-0
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.500
Umm.

19a2455a-8fe7-4d57-851a-26372c202ebf-0
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.750
Movie set.

cd242414-c3e9-43d7-8154-c7e1ab16546b-0
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.640
Or some type of Convention
Center. We can see that behind

cd242414-c3e9-43d7-8154-c7e1ab16546b-1
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.801
each of these little stations
there are about 5 stations.

cd242414-c3e9-43d7-8154-c7e1ab16546b-2
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:47.464
There's one to the top left side
of the page that is all focused

cd242414-c3e9-43d7-8154-c7e1ab16546b-3
00:24:47.464 --> 00:24:49.760
on dinosaurs. And then there is.

7eae1d23-e5de-49e3-918d-f47720fd3709-0
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.530
The one right next to it.

2f973fd8-a958-452b-bc39-dff7d7fc51f8-0
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.930
Closer to the right side of the
page, it is all.

647d101a-841a-4bb1-baac-d6258107bfa4-0
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.700
Spaceship and alien related, and
then the three in the front

647d101a-841a-4bb1-baac-d6258107bfa4-1
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.980
going from left to right it
seems to be costumes and makeup,

647d101a-841a-4bb1-baac-d6258107bfa4-2
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.910
and then in the middle it seems
to be a haunted forest.

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-0
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.540
And then on the right side at
the bottom, it looks to be a

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-1
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.418
diner with ice cream and lots of
different and pie. I see like

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-2
00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:24.172
there are pictures of pie and
everything. So it does look to

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-3
00:25:24.172 --> 00:25:28.049
be a movie set because there's
like lights everywhere that are

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-4
00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:31.741
hanging around and people, we
have a makeup station that in

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-5
00:25:31.741 --> 00:25:35.311
the left hand corner. People are
clearly putting on their

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-6
00:25:35.311 --> 00:25:39.065
costumes and getting all ready.
We see a person going into a

be67b15a-eeb9-457a-8bec-9fa3cc7d4b9c-7
00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:41.649
dressing room in a pink dinosaur
costume.

db87035d-1767-4cc5-90a3-76ca8f4e4f66-0
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:47.558
And people are sitting down
getting their makeup done and

db87035d-1767-4cc5-90a3-76ca8f4e4f66-1
00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:48.620
then in the.

98001752-e776-4b95-877c-52c6f7202b67-0
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.424
Evil Haunted forest area. There
looks to be 3 big lights and

98001752-e776-4b95-877c-52c6f7202b67-1
00:25:55.424 --> 00:26:00.505
beneath that there are people
dressed as mummies. There are

98001752-e776-4b95-877c-52c6f7202b67-2
00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:01.860
people dress as.

57b5b33d-bec0-4ebd-b835-6935cfb99ccc-0
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.736
Like green goblins and ghosts
and werewolves, and they all

57b5b33d-bec0-4ebd-b835-6935cfb99ccc-1
00:26:07.736 --> 00:26:12.533
have their arms outstretched and
they're shooting something

57b5b33d-bec0-4ebd-b835-6935cfb99ccc-2
00:26:12.533 --> 00:26:17.170
because somebody is has like a
director's camera and it's

57b5b33d-bec0-4ebd-b835-6935cfb99ccc-3
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.530
pointing at them.

6e4b53d5-dd78-4583-9f86-eef13700589b-0
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.654
And he's appear to be shooting
something in this haunted

6e4b53d5-dd78-4583-9f86-eef13700589b-1
00:26:22.654 --> 00:26:26.151
forest. It's got trees. You can
kind of tell that it's haunted

6e4b53d5-dd78-4583-9f86-eef13700589b-2
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.040
because there's.

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-0
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.477
The truth have faces that have
those like stereotypical, like

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-1
00:26:32.477 --> 00:26:36.835
yellow eyes peeking out and they
look got black back. It's in

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-2
00:26:36.835 --> 00:26:41.473
those trees. It's a little black
background and they've got teeth

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-3
00:26:41.473 --> 00:26:45.901
and everything. So you can kind
of tell is the haunted for the

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-4
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:50.118
haunted forest. And then next
door to that, on the right is

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-5
00:26:50.118 --> 00:26:54.406
the diner where it looks like
all of the cast and characters

86e3e79d-4a89-4fce-acb1-9ae84fc1fb8d-6
00:26:54.406 --> 00:26:57.850
are kind of all gathered to eat.
We see Dracula.

e15e25b7-4f30-4337-84b1-e4aba7985121-0
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.880
Sitting next to like an alien
and they all, some people appear

e15e25b7-4f30-4337-84b1-e4aba7985121-1
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.447
to be in costume, some appear to
be in plain dress. So you seem

e15e25b7-4f30-4337-84b1-e4aba7985121-2
00:27:05.447 --> 00:27:09.125

of in between shots.

71884e93-56bf-4458-8116-fc7d99e07698-0
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.180
And Umm.

72e8f210-084f-4fc3-a79c-4c643f46f60a-0
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.740
Yeah. And so I mean we see
somebody in these big green

72e8f210-084f-4fc3-a79c-4c643f46f60a-1
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.321
pants with red polka dots and
they're kind of like those

00:27:28.223 --> 00:27:33.125
type of line where you go and
you get your food. It's like a

72e8f210-084f-4fc3-a79c-4c643f46f60a-4
00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:36.259
cafeteria style, cafeteria style
food.

8c151214-6b55-487e-86be-4d3283fc6779-0
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.203
They're going up, they're
getting your food, and then

8c151214-6b55-487e-86be-4d3283fc6779-1
00:27:40.203 --> 00:27:44.035
there's somebody, a woman with a
pink dress is checking people

8c151214-6b55-487e-86be-4d3283fc6779-2
00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:47.927
out as they get their food and
they head out the door. And then

8c151214-6b55-487e-86be-4d3283fc6779-3
00:27:47.927 --> 00:27:51.210
if you turn to the space
station, there like 10 or 15

8c151214-6b55-487e-86be-4d3283fc6779-4
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.129
people that are being suspended
by these ropes.

c9e87844-1b45-40df-a173-426652bb4d7c-0
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.852

astronauts.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.740
There are five or four different
types of.

Like.

6c8cb06c-6b5f-4009-9fe7-f3394cdd0add-0
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:12.363
UFO's and they're filled with
the aliens or people that are

6c8cb06c-6b5f-4009-9fe7-f3394cdd0add-1
00:28:12.363 --> 00:28:17.020
dressed in alien attire. There
is a all of the space.

6429a85a-8865-49dc-9558-bc6013200e8b-0
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.635
The astronauts are all coming
out of this spaceship. It's an

6429a85a-8865-49dc-9558-bc6013200e8b-1
00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:27.480
orange and yellow spaceship on
this blue like deserted land.

285c8591-15c9-4a98-a2c9-c074eb1dc957-0
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.244
I'm assuming Mars I'm gonna say
Mars and it's on there on this

285c8591-15c9-4a98-a2c9-c074eb1dc957-1
00:28:34.244 --> 00:28:36.230
blue Mars type of set.

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-0
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.102
In front of the spaceship
there's somebody in a directors

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-1
00:28:42.102 --> 00:28:46.710
chair, but that is filming the
scene. There's boom mic and all

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-2
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:51.392
sorts of people are just kind of
the astronauts are around, and

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-3
00:28:51.392 --> 00:28:55.781
it seems to be a big scuffle
between the astronauts and the

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-4
00:28:55.781 --> 00:29:00.096
aliens. Meanwhile, directors are
kind of directing people.

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-5
00:29:00.096 --> 00:29:04.558
There's a person in a blue and
white striped shirt with pink

60ae9ad2-d9fa-449f-b910-57c3214aa3fe-6
00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:08.070
ship let with the pink pants
that is directing.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.220
Say an astronaut. We have

cf04cf4f-6082-4b93-a8df-cedcfbbb78c8-0
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.680


5e2cfa82-70de-4633-8d31-6d6cda1ed0cd-0
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.087
A lot going on with that, and
the UFO's are pink and green and

5e2cfa82-70de-4633-8d31-6d6cda1ed0cd-1
00:29:18.087 --> 00:29:18.370
red.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.595
And they're all suspended in
there. There's one that looks to

bdc44234-0a41-4d97-ad3b-95c4b2e8a372-1
00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:25.940
be almost like a Titanic, like
it was like a Titanic UFO.

dfed0649-71b6-42e6-945e-97c9444413dc-0
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.460
Umm.

26df0b14-01a9-4eab-bad7-e815ca756dbf-0
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.810
And so not only move on to the
dinosaurs and.

98994ff7-1920-42f6-8fb8-8069819d50e5-0
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.810
In the dinosaur area there are.

f35e1101-5b17-4327-b139-ca21a07fd81c-0
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.458
Like 5 or 6. It's like dinosaurs
and Cavemen and the Cavemen all

f35e1101-5b17-4327-b139-ca21a07fd81c-1
00:29:42.458 --> 00:29:46.626
are dressed pretty
stereotypically in these brown

f35e1101-5b17-4327-b139-ca21a07fd81c-2
00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:47.210
little.

91240b16-ec90-4805-bb1d-23d4aa35fbc0-0
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.330
scruffy would have belonged to
mammoth dresses.

24164e88-ccf6-4f0f-b977-3b3226944cda-0
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.024
There and that type of attire
and and there are five or six.

24164e88-ccf6-4f0f-b977-3b3226944cda-1
00:29:59.024 --> 00:30:02.879
So dinosaurs that are all
dressed up and they're Cavemen

24164e88-ccf6-4f0f-b977-3b3226944cda-2
00:30:02.879 --> 00:30:03.420
are all.

7d59413e-bca1-4dd1-890e-4618e4d3418c-0
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.013
Playing with the dinosaurs and
scratching them and.

7d59413e-bca1-4dd1-890e-4618e4d3418c-1

Yeah.

aa8e276b-1421-4c13-8d3b-c63943e46ee0-0
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.689
Yeah, you just let me know

00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:18.875
about it, OK? Alright. So before
that, let's take a break. This

aa8e276b-1421-4c13-8d3b-c63943e46ee0-2
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:19.660
is being OK.

Alright.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.862
Now the next item is again a
complex scene, so describe what

65569718-26d8-4750-b33a-9e40da4a9503-1
00:30:28.862 --> 00:30:32.987
you see and what is happening in
the estimate details as you can,

00:30:32.987 --> 00:30:36.987
and I'll keep track of the time.
They will be between three and

65569718-26d8-4750-b33a-9e40da4a9503-3
00:30:36.987 --> 00:30:37.800
five minutes.

#START_birthday_party_fum This
looks to be a birthday party.

c15154ae-abae-4b89-84f0-537d7b9a7f8c-0
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:48.418
I can kind of tell from there's
a birthday cake that is being

c15154ae-abae-4b89-84f0-537d7b9a7f8c-1
00:30:48.418 --> 00:30:54.077
presented in the the left side
of the page that someone in the

c15154ae-abae-4b89-84f0-537d7b9a7f8c-2
00:30:54.077 --> 00:30:59.556
blue shirt is walking around
with birthday cake. And there's

c15154ae-abae-4b89-84f0-537d7b9a7f8c-3
00:30:59.556 --> 00:31:05.214
also the biggest thing indicator
is the bouncy house. It's got

c15154ae-abae-4b89-84f0-537d7b9a7f8c-4
00:31:05.214 --> 00:31:10.783
blue, it's got yellow and red
Spires resembling a castle, and

c15154ae-abae-4b89-84f0-537d7b9a7f8c-5
00:31:10.783 --> 00:31:12.580
there appears to be.

f1646a5c-4a11-4c6c-a376-44d26b2a08fb-0
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:18.044
All sorts of kids in these
various different costumes. So

f1646a5c-4a11-4c6c-a376-44d26b2a08fb-1
00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:22.860
it's a costume birthday party,
and there's a rabbit that's

f1646a5c-4a11-4c6c-a376-44d26b2a08fb-2
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:28.166
jumping on the bouncy castle, a
bat that's jumping on the bouncy

f1646a5c-4a11-4c6c-a376-44d26b2a08fb-3
00:31:28.166 --> 00:31:33.146
castle, some kid is dressed up
as Spiderman. There's an Iron

f1646a5c-4a11-4c6c-a376-44d26b2a08fb-4
00:31:33.146 --> 00:31:38.370
Man and an alligator and a gnome
and uh a witch. And so they're

f1646a5c-4a11-4c6c-a376-44d26b2a08fb-5
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.860
all kind of jumping on the
bouncy castle and it looks.

d1b5a216-fa6c-4481-99c3-e47de0a0b07d-0
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.450
It's an outdoor party. We can
kind of tell from the trees.

d1b5a216-fa6c-4481-99c3-e47de0a0b07d-1
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.038
There are party decorations that
are hung over the trees and

d1b5a216-fa6c-4481-99c3-e47de0a0b07d-2
00:31:50.038 --> 00:31:53.450
they're so there are like little
lanterns and everything.

7b8d4522-1109-4177-b99d-7572bf12476e-0
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.439
And there are people that are
like kids, dress as, like

7b8d4522-1109-4177-b99d-7572bf12476e-1
00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:03.740
animals. And so there's one as a
lion, there's one in zebra,

7b8d4522-1109-4177-b99d-7572bf12476e-2
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.183
there's one as an elephant that
there is some and they're just

7b8d4522-1109-4177-b99d-7572bf12476e-3
00:32:08.183 --> 00:32:12.767
kind of all running around. And
then there's also a pool, like a

7b8d4522-1109-4177-b99d-7572bf12476e-4
00:32:12.767 --> 00:32:17.069
little Kiddie pool where someone
is dressed as a mermaid and

7b8d4522-1109-4177-b99d-7572bf12476e-5
00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:19.889
people are throwing water onto
her and.

8a9a88e2-d3cf-4b11-924c-b4e458b6fb00-0
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.910
They're like squirting each
other what looks like.

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-0
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.126
Squirting like water guns and
everything. They're squirting

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-1
00:32:29.126 --> 00:32:33.301
each other in the face, but and
then there's a kid with a hose

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-2
00:32:33.301 --> 00:32:37.211
with squirting himself in the
face, and he looks like he's

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-3
00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:41.320
dressed as a fireman, which is
ironic. And then there next to

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-4
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.700
that is a table full of
presents, which is another

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-5
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.610
indicator of the party. So
there's a white table, and it's

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-6
00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:52.719
right next to the front gate to
the garden party where people

588707ba-df45-4d17-ad57-23b53a1b06f0-7
00:32:52.719 --> 00:32:54.840
are walking in holding presents.

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-0
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.760
They're dropping them off at the
party section. At the gift

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-1
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.548
section, people are collecting
the gifts and then so they just

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-2
00:33:04.548 --> 00:33:09.184
setting them on the table and
then participating in the fun.

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-3
00:33:09.184 --> 00:33:13.516
There is a clown with a pink
wig, a purple hat, a yellow

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-4
00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:18.380
suit, and big giant clown feet.
That's a little to the left top

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-5
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.168
of the Kitty pool section. So
there's the Kiddie pool section.

83abf055-ea90-4258-b480-99c62cd3cecb-6
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:24.080
That's down.

b72d2908-ba1c-43e5-a9e5-91a783d34334-0
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.465
By the left bottom part of the
page, I go in the middle and the

b72d2908-ba1c-43e5-a9e5-91a783d34334-1
00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:31.586
clown is right next to that, and
you've got three balloons. Got a

b72d2908-ba1c-43e5-a9e5-91a783d34334-2
00:33:31.586 --> 00:33:33.950
yellow balloon, a red balloon
and a blue balloon.

f2cbcb66-58d0-412b-9331-7fa36b1599ce-0
00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.304
And he's surrounded by all these
kids. This one girl that is

f2cbcb66-58d0-412b-9331-7fa36b1599ce-1
00:33:38.304 --> 00:33:41.411
dressed as a fairy looks
terrified and she was very

f2cbcb66-58d0-412b-9331-7fa36b1599ce-2
00:33:41.411 --> 00:33:41.889
unhappy.

721780bc-3ace-4981-ad52-9ecb57bdd8dc-0
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.476
And then next to the clown,
there are two sides of tug of

721780bc-3ace-4981-ad52-9ecb57bdd8dc-1
00:33:47.476 --> 00:33:50.400
war. There are some kids that
are dressed as.

af5e9d07-5235-4333-9bbb-5076437bae93-0
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:58.270
There's a superhero at the front
and a kid that dressed as a.

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-0
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.826
what is it that got the horns,
the helmet that has a... Viking!

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-1
00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:07.438
kind of Viking hat, and they're
right next to the table with all

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-2
00:34:07.438 --> 00:34:10.327
the food. So you've got
sandwiches, cake, cupcakes,

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-3
00:34:10.327 --> 00:34:13.773
salad, party plates, parties,
animals and all that stuff like

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-4
00:34:13.773 --> 00:34:16.995
that. And then they have that
person with the cake that's

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-5
00:34:16.995 --> 00:34:20.107
coming by and the cake has
little candles in it. And so

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-6
00:34:20.107 --> 00:34:23.330
we're all, they're all going to
sit around and sing happy

8cf8ba17-6079-498c-ab84-84e3593a6e4a-7
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.220
birthday.

b2e2d230-77e8-42ca-bbb7-0e1a115062a1-0
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.330
OK, moving on. This is another
complex scene.

cf99dc7f-894b-426e-92c3-b19c641a016b-0
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.170
OK, so you can start when you're
ready.

afc144c6-143a-42d0-b0f9-f43bea617dba-0
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.640
It's down.

7a23d314-c669-498c-9c71-a15c8fe5b35b-0
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:43.120
#START_picture_this It looks to
just be a series of.

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-0
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.526
Pictures that so portraits and
things. So there's several

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-1
00:34:47.526 --> 00:34:51.478
portraits. We'll first start
with the right side of the page,

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-2
00:34:51.478 --> 00:34:55.621
because there's a lot to go off
of. I just keep getting drawn to

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-3
00:34:55.621 --> 00:34:59.700
the middle of the right side of
the page. It is a bald man with

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-4
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.779
these two Tufts of hair and two
tubs of his eyebrows are really

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-5
00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:07.731
fluffy. He's got a handlebar
mustache and he's wearing a blue

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-6
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:11.810
shirt. And then right above him
there are three people that are

3f9dc00c-ad98-4633-a8d5-65f61137b42f-7
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.319
wearing.

73df095f-babf-49d1-9cec-026ac2d75e57-0
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.400
Like tank tops and spiked belts
and.

35d92ea7-021b-47fe-a8c0-047140fb12e3-0
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:24.062
It seems like one of them is
wearing like a a bandit hat and

35d92ea7-021b-47fe-a8c0-047140fb12e3-1
00:35:24.062 --> 00:35:27.390
is whacking the other person in
the face.

eb8b50be-c76d-4115-b430-5d2479c6f88a-0
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.807
And they're all but They're all
wearing bandit hats. And the

eb8b50be-c76d-4115-b430-5d2479c6f88a-1
00:35:33.807 --> 00:35:39.262
person below, the mustache man,
has uh red slippers and a red

eb8b50be-c76d-4115-b430-5d2479c6f88a-2
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:44.453
snorkel with a green bathing
suit. And they're floating on

eb8b50be-c76d-4115-b430-5d2479c6f88a-3
00:35:44.453 --> 00:35:49.645
top of a fountain, a water
fountain. And then the portrait

eb8b50be-c76d-4115-b430-5d2479c6f88a-4
00:35:49.645 --> 00:35:54.924
below that has two people, one
in a red suit, one in a blue

eb8b50be-c76d-4115-b430-5d2479c6f88a-5
00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:56.860
suit on a rocket ship.

0aa90e24-edc8-43c0-8c0b-246f13d47591-0
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:03.158
And then below that, there's a
person that has a putt being

0aa90e24-edc8-43c0-8c0b-246f13d47591-1
00:36:03.158 --> 00:36:05.360
putt in the face with a red pie.

974f7bc3-ed19-4c42-93c4-4e185e358eab-0
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.585
And below that there are two
people, one in a red shirt, one

974f7bc3-ed19-4c42-93c4-4e185e358eab-1
00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:12.630
in the green shirt, and they're
sitting next to a palm tree.

feeab157-3ca5-46dc-a8ef-156b66bf2ebf-0
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.821
And what is falling on them, are
those grapes? They could be

feeab157-3ca5-46dc-a8ef-156b66bf2ebf-1
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:21.925
grapes. Hmm. I don't know what's
going on on it look like little

feeab157-3ca5-46dc-a8ef-156b66bf2ebf-2
00:36:21.925 --> 00:36:25.902
bear. They appear to look like
grapes or some type of like nut

feeab157-3ca5-46dc-a8ef-156b66bf2ebf-3
00:36:25.902 --> 00:36:29.691
or acorn or something. But I
guess the person that like hit

feeab157-3ca5-46dc-a8ef-156b66bf2ebf-4
00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:33.795
it had it them all fall onto the
person with the green shirt. So

feeab157-3ca5-46dc-a8ef-156b66bf2ebf-5
00:36:33.795 --> 00:36:36.510
the person with the green shirt
is aghast.

04fa9e86-966d-409e-9009-1bc1db29a1dd-0
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:43.882
And then at the bottom of that
page there is a woman in a

04fa9e86-966d-409e-9009-1bc1db29a1dd-1
00:36:43.882 --> 00:36:48.912
yellow shirt that comes in
contact with a dragon that looks

04fa9e86-966d-409e-9009-1bc1db29a1dd-2
00:36:48.912 --> 00:36:54.278
like with red eyes and it's got
smoke coming out of its little,

04fa9e86-966d-409e-9009-1bc1db29a1dd-3
00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:59.643
it's like little snorkel area.
And then the person next to that

04fa9e86-966d-409e-9009-1bc1db29a1dd-4
00:36:59.643 --> 00:37:04.758
or the portion next to that has
bear and a person in a brown

04fa9e86-966d-409e-9009-1bc1db29a1dd-5
00:37:04.758 --> 00:37:07.860
shirt that's kind of that has
their.

e0606cfa-8b79-4c28-bc89-7514c386af56-0
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.540
Back towards the bear, and the
bear is tapping the person on

e0606cfa-8b79-4c28-bc89-7514c386af56-1
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.730
the shoulder, so that can't go
well.

0cb9d39a-5311-454c-9cb3-ac49c4ae5fe6-0
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:21.230
And then there is a person with
a red face covering.

d9afe461-ff5c-4604-8573-116d230f0832-0
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:29.214
And they're skiing, but they're
wearing like a a red like morph

d9afe461-ff5c-4604-8573-116d230f0832-1
00:37:29.214 --> 00:37:35.486
suit or something, and there's
skiing with like a blue jacket

d9afe461-ff5c-4604-8573-116d230f0832-2
00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:35.790
on.

545c2780-3c45-4c06-80f9-dc79c11679f9-0
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.850
And.

5554ecc0-1d4a-43c4-abe2-b3120ea37a5a-0
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.493
I'm just going to look at the
bigger pictures now. So there is

5554ecc0-1d4a-43c4-abe2-b3120ea37a5a-1
00:37:44.493 --> 00:37:49.426
another picture that has hand to
the right side of it and they

5554ecc0-1d4a-43c4-abe2-b3120ea37a5a-2
00:37:49.426 --> 00:37:53.419
have rings on each of the hand.
It looks like and.

c9108e0a-e617-4bbf-9656-1dbf703d051a-0
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.585
Then up at the top of the right
side of the page there are two

c9108e0a-e617-4bbf-9656-1dbf703d051a-1
00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:04.841
people that are sumo wrestling.
So they're in like little sumo

c9108e0a-e617-4bbf-9656-1dbf703d051a-2
00:38:04.841 --> 00:38:10.180
underwear type of clothing and
they appear to be sumo wrestling

c9108e0a-e617-4bbf-9656-1dbf703d051a-3
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.186
and then we move on to the left
side of the page. There's a

c9108e0a-e617-4bbf-9656-1dbf703d051a-4
00:38:15.186 --> 00:38:20.609
person that is in a snowball, so
they are in a like snowball and

c9108e0a-e617-4bbf-9656-1dbf703d051a-5
00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:24.280
they have their arms sticking
out from the.

73082951-5cfe-42d4-967a-5613b5f9f1a3-0
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.875
snowball and their head sticking
out from the snowball and it

73082951-5cfe-42d4-967a-5613b5f9f1a3-1
00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:30.880
looks like a leg sticking out
from the snowball and.

68dd6361-c956-47b0-b8c8-39def782b7ef-0
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.818
They and then below that is a
person that looks like they're

68dd6361-c956-47b0-b8c8-39def782b7ef-1
00:38:37.818 --> 00:38:39.700
bent over like some type of.

ea96cc74-979e-4e97-a302-9a733e0ab7a8-0
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.198
Guardrail or something. It looks
like there are two metal beams

ea96cc74-979e-4e97-a302-9a733e0ab7a8-1
00:38:44.198 --> 00:38:47.838
and they're kind of splayed out
over that. Like their legs are

ea96cc74-979e-4e97-a302-9a733e0ab7a8-2
00:38:47.838 --> 00:38:51.190
on one side and their upper
bodies on the other side, and

ea96cc74-979e-4e97-a302-9a733e0ab7a8-3
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.080
they're wearing a yellow shirt
and pants and hat.

927403a8-5f11-40e6-81ae-bdfd3492c7d1-0
00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.980
And then right next to that is a
person that has like a very tall

927403a8-5f11-40e6-81ae-bdfd3492c7d1-1
00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:05.264
pointy witch hat and looks like
their face is green. So maybe

927403a8-5f11-40e6-81ae-bdfd3492c7d1-2
00:39:05.264 --> 00:39:05.610
it's.

f27c4714-7f8d-49f7-a3f9-9c1b2f9e7561-0
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.471
From the Wizard of Oz or
something. #END_picture_pictures

f27c4714-7f8d-49f7-a3f9-9c1b2f9e7561-1
00:39:12.471 --> 00:39:17.618
And then yeah, good, it was
about the little portraits.

f27c4714-7f8d-49f7-a3f9-9c1b2f9e7561-2
00:39:17.618 --> 00:39:20.099
Yeah, OK, so the next item.

b5e85dd6-8d6b-4861-8893-615dfbd01591-0
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:25.956
It's a part of the story again.
So as you go through the story,

b5e85dd6-8d6b-4861-8893-615dfbd01591-1
00:39:25.956 --> 00:39:29.040
describe what is happening and
what you see.

7f428137-f446-4d48-b59f-fc1a10908cdb-0
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:36.913
#START_arrival_1 All right, so
it opens up on a family of three

7f428137-f446-4d48-b59f-fc1a10908cdb-1
00:39:36.913 --> 00:39:40.760
dad, mom or two, parents and
child and.

47355fdc-f593-4259-b641-a6c0ea57ca14-0
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.967
That person is taking it down
off of the it's a portrait of

47355fdc-f593-4259-b641-a6c0ea57ca14-1
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:49.970
them, and a person is taking it
down off of whatever.

e4af803e-423c-49d3-a44f-8181307b3ba7-0
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.289
Ledge it was on and they start
wrapping it in this paper and

e4af803e-423c-49d3-a44f-8181307b3ba7-1
00:39:56.289 --> 00:40:00.222
they start tying a ribbon around
it and they put packet it in

e4af803e-423c-49d3-a44f-8181307b3ba7-2
00:40:00.222 --> 00:40:04.155
their suitcase and close the
suitcase with a buckle and start

e4af803e-423c-49d3-a44f-8181307b3ba7-3
00:40:04.155 --> 00:40:05.170
to push it away.

a19d015d-ab19-4399-8c28-5c63dd2540fe-0
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:16.373
Also on this ledge, it looks
like is a bird, a paper machine

a19d015d-ab19-4399-8c28-5c63dd2540fe-1
00:40:16.373 --> 00:40:17.880
bird, a clock.

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-0
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.685
It's just focusing on different
aspects of this couple's home.

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-1
00:40:23.685 --> 00:40:28.051
There's a a hat and a cloth for
drying of some sort. There's a

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-2
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:32.140
pot with a wooden spoon. There
is a child's drawing of the

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-3
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:36.367
family, so it looks like the
dad. He has the hat on. He also

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-4
00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:40.455
has the bird on his arm, and
then the mom and the dad, and

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-5
00:40:40.455 --> 00:40:44.474
it's really painting a picture
of the the family's house.

dd83a2fe-0974-4c4d-bb9f-e9db39f977d3-6
00:40:44.474 --> 00:40:48.910
There's a tea kettle that looks
to be broken with a tea kettle.

4bb37273-ec8c-448b-8f83-3e57b4f1e011-0
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.590
Like tea mug and that is just
kind of.

c171e3f3-43a1-4607-9565-d05e1357b1a6-0
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.495
Kept. But you can kind of tell
that this is a family that's

c171e3f3-43a1-4607-9565-d05e1357b1a6-1
00:40:57.495 --> 00:41:01.129
poor, but they're packing up
their that family picture for

c171e3f3-43a1-4607-9565-d05e1357b1a6-2
00:41:01.129 --> 00:41:04.763
some reason. And so that's
that's the suitcase that we see

c171e3f3-43a1-4607-9565-d05e1357b1a6-3
00:41:04.763 --> 00:41:08.705
is that this couple is holding
hands over the suitcase for some

c171e3f3-43a1-4607-9565-d05e1357b1a6-4
00:41:08.705 --> 00:41:11.599
reason, having packed up their
family picture.

08ea819b-6fc0-41d6-a51b-8751ae54caa2-0
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:18.850
Um.

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-0
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.691
So a child starts to wake up,
it's I guess it's morning time

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-1
00:41:23.691 --> 00:41:27.532
and she starts to wake up, rubs
her eyes as she goes downstairs

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-2
00:41:27.532 --> 00:41:31.073
to eat food and she's eating
breakfast and she notices the

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-3
00:41:31.073 --> 00:41:34.854
suitcase and she notices her dad
starting to get ready and her

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-4
00:41:34.854 --> 00:41:38.456
mom starting to get ready. The
mom wrapped the cloth around

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-5
00:41:38.456 --> 00:41:42.357
herself. Her dad puts on her hat
and they helped her put on her,

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-6
00:41:42.357 --> 00:41:45.778
her jacket and her rain boots
and they help her grab her

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-7
00:41:45.778 --> 00:41:49.319
suitcase and they leave their
house and as they're leaving

5c619bbe-7fb5-4fc2-925d-6d57291e10be-8
00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:50.040
their house.

cc5afbd7-7d3e-4977-9e3a-4d40c77d16b1-0
00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.420
See the tail of the dragon kind
of fly by.

ab8cf131-78fd-4e39-a808-af9080e682ac-0
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:04.540
And so they're very mournfully
leaving. Wherever they're going,

ab8cf131-78fd-4e39-a808-af9080e682ac-1
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.870
they're leaving.

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-0
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.299
It doesn't look like they're all
leaving together. So the girl is

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-1
00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:15.169
looking up, but she's got her
hat on. She's holding on to her

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-2
00:42:15.169 --> 00:42:18.665
dad's hat. She sees a train
that's coming and there are

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-3
00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:22.347
people all around them that are
currently leaving as well.

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-4
00:42:22.347 --> 00:42:26.092
They've all got their bags and
everything. Um the dad turns

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-5
00:42:26.092 --> 00:42:30.025
towards her, the daughter, and
lifts up his hat and underneath

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-6
00:42:30.025 --> 00:42:33.895
the hat is the paper machine
dove, and she holds on to it and

2a1f39ee-0d47-4c1b-914f-e0e5645f9068-7
00:42:33.895 --> 00:42:37.889
she gives him a big hug and she
holds the dove in her hand and.

bacf432f-0e00-47fe-8fb8-8092dc4ece4c-0
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.857
Looks up at her mother and her
mother is crying and her mother

bacf432f-0e00-47fe-8fb8-8092dc4ece4c-1
00:42:41.857 --> 00:42:45.693
hugs her father and they have a
very sweet embrace where he's

bacf432f-0e00-47fe-8fb8-8092dc4ece4c-2
00:42:45.693 --> 00:42:49.714
getting ready to leave and then
he ends up leaving and they hold

bacf432f-0e00-47fe-8fb8-8092dc4ece4c-3
00:42:49.714 --> 00:42:53.364
on to his hand for as long as
they can, but he gets on the

bacf432f-0e00-47fe-8fb8-8092dc4ece4c-4
00:42:53.364 --> 00:42:56.519
train and leaves and the train
rides out of sight.

c1917ba5-9632-477c-a925-df02320395a9-0
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:06.878
And so while he's on the train,
it kind of focuses on the, first

c1917ba5-9632-477c-a925-df02320395a9-1
00:43:06.878 --> 00:43:12.755
it focuses on like the portrait
of the family, and it pans back

c1917ba5-9632-477c-a925-df02320395a9-2
00:43:12.755 --> 00:43:16.980
a little bit and you see him
eating his food.

5c8bce9d-6cd7-4f08-93ee-6ceeb601e5a5-0
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.131
And he's eating some soup and it
keeps panning out and panning

5c8bce9d-6cd7-4f08-93ee-6ceeb601e5a5-1
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:25.590
out and panning out until you
see that he's on the Titanic.

35a1730b-065f-4687-a1af-a6830375d0e2-0
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:30.722
And that it cannot be good. And
so he's on the Titanic and it

35a1730b-065f-4687-a1af-a6830375d0e2-1
00:43:30.722 --> 00:43:34.232
seems that he's probably going
to die on the Titanic and.

35a1730b-065f-4687-a1af-a6830375d0e2-2
00:43:34.232 --> 00:43:35.080
#END_arrival_1

dda50563-b1fa-4c38-96fa-3c1678967328-0
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:36.950
OK.

1f1317d1-3367-4725-886d-12f14b4bab7e-0
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.567
OK, let's finish another part of
the story and we can now go on

1f1317d1-3367-4725-886d-12f14b4bab7e-1
00:43:44.567 --> 00:43:46.110
to the next item.

3194ec77-00c3-4096-a7d4-3a009d9f4df8-0
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:53.018
Um, again. It's a complex scene.
There's a lot going on. Just

3194ec77-00c3-4096-a7d4-3a009d9f4df8-1
00:43:53.018 --> 00:43:58.019
describe it in as many details
as you can and you can start

3194ec77-00c3-4096-a7d4-3a009d9f4df8-2
00:43:58.019 --> 00:43:59.520
when you're ready.

c455c831-7056-4c83-8643-f61b1e464530-0
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.250
All right.

630cd75a-739f-4863-bc53-b4771c9e8285-0
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:09.382
#START_wild_west So this looks
like it is like a Wild West

630cd75a-739f-4863-bc53-b4771c9e8285-1
00:44:09.382 --> 00:44:14.877
themed fun house carnival. So
there are all sorts of saloon

630cd75a-739f-4863-bc53-b4771c9e8285-2
00:44:14.877 --> 00:44:20.463
signs everywhere. There is the
tame east saloon, there's two

630cd75a-739f-4863-bc53-b4771c9e8285-3
00:44:20.463 --> 00:44:26.232
saloons that are just saloon. So
because there's like a lot of

630cd75a-739f-4863-bc53-b4771c9e8285-4
00:44:26.232 --> 00:44:28.980
like wild Wild West, big wild.

85414894-9ee7-43af-9f7e-0fe4cd4a6ea1-0
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.870
west themed. So everybody is in
cowboy hats and.

13b955d2-7a2f-413d-ac81-4354ebe045b3-0
00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:41.008
And at the top right corner we
see somebody on a White Horse,

13b955d2-7a2f-413d-ac81-4354ebe045b3-1
00:44:41.008 --> 00:44:45.327
kind of literally was like
running off into a picture of

13b955d2-7a2f-413d-ac81-4354ebe045b3-2
00:44:45.327 --> 00:44:50.102
the sunset and they're waving
everybody goodbye. Umm. And then

13b955d2-7a2f-413d-ac81-4354ebe045b3-3
00:44:50.102 --> 00:44:54.800
there looks to be a group of
scientists. They've all got like

13b955d2-7a2f-413d-ac81-4354ebe045b3-4
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.710
white coats.

0267fe67-f7cd-4782-b47e-da574e3b6551-0
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:03.180
And they're walking towards the
saloon and and so then.

02114498-91ae-4943-8df7-affcfbe84c9f-0
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:10.209
At the one more saloon there is
a cannon and a group of people

02114498-91ae-4943-8df7-affcfbe84c9f-1
00:45:10.209 --> 00:45:15.613
are observing the cannon. There
are also a group of people that

02114498-91ae-4943-8df7-affcfbe84c9f-2
00:45:15.613 --> 00:45:20.933
are painting the one more saloon
red instead of yellow, and so

02114498-91ae-4943-8df7-affcfbe84c9f-3
00:45:20.933 --> 00:45:25.577
maybe this is the set. So
they're painting it red with

02114498-91ae-4943-8df7-affcfbe84c9f-4
00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:30.305
yellow, there's ladders
everywhere, and then below that

02114498-91ae-4943-8df7-affcfbe84c9f-5
00:45:30.305 --> 00:45:34.190
there is a red train with the
number 2 on it.

5f3f1c40-422a-437f-9dbd-bbb38c7f1787-0
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.090
And um.

37f61bc3-a1b0-4135-8fe1-e02afef25433-0
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:44.213
So they are that that's coming
up to a stop and there's a

37f61bc3-a1b0-4135-8fe1-e02afef25433-1
00:45:44.213 --> 00:45:50.813
carriage in front of there. It's
a red carriage. It's got all

37f61bc3-a1b0-4135-8fe1-e02afef25433-2
00:45:50.813 --> 00:45:55.710
sorts of luggage and such on it
and then the.

c94e8b11-4a13-4b78-926a-8ada29a03fba-0
00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.970
Pioneer Saloon, so the pioneer
saloon.

29ce7e26-ea91-45cd-97e3-c9b309b16e38-0
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.491
has all sorts of people just
kind of hanging off. It's a blue

29ce7e26-ea91-45cd-97e3-c9b309b16e38-1
00:46:06.491 --> 00:46:10.447
building. And then I can't tell
if the red part of the building

29ce7e26-ea91-45cd-97e3-c9b309b16e38-2
00:46:10.447 --> 00:46:14.155
that's right in front of it is
also part of that red of the

29ce7e26-ea91-45cd-97e3-c9b309b16e38-3
00:46:14.155 --> 00:46:15.330
Pioneer saloon, but

7abac4b2-5450-4f27-ba8c-b8d79ab6cc64-0
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.235
We're going to say this and it
looks like they're all just

7abac4b2-5450-4f27-ba8c-b8d79ab6cc64-1
00:46:21.235 --> 00:46:23.260
people hanging off of the.

ce22d76c-601b-4826-a504-b6c599acecd6-0
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:30.375
All the stairs and there's a
director there. Actually, they

ce22d76c-601b-4826-a504-b6c599acecd6-1
00:46:30.375 --> 00:46:34.220
have a big movie camera filming
this scene, OK.

3a47293c-ba50-44c8-a8f2-3ade7d0d76c6-0
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:41.394
And then next to the Pioneer
Saloon, on the left bottom side

3a47293c-ba50-44c8-a8f2-3ade7d0d76c6-1
00:46:41.394 --> 00:46:47.100
of the page, there are stamps of
bison. It looks like there's

3a47293c-ba50-44c8-a8f2-3ade7d0d76c6-2
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.230
like 30 stamps of like bison
and.

3114e2d6-d362-4d29-868f-42564c741915-0
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.140
There's a horse that's drawing a
picture of.

33087c71-17bc-4ce3-87a2-4a610ec7279a-0
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:03.090
Of a carriage or what is the
what are those called they I

33087c71-17bc-4ce3-87a2-4a610ec7279a-1
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:09.745
used to pioneer in them pioneer
carriage and they but the horse

33087c71-17bc-4ce3-87a2-4a610ec7279a-2
00:47:09.745 --> 00:47:16.400
is drawing it and that's absurd
and that's right near the bison

33087c71-17bc-4ce3-87a2-4a610ec7279a-3
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:22.638
and the jail and on the jail
there are two pictures under a

33087c71-17bc-4ce3-87a2-4a610ec7279a-4
00:47:22.638 --> 00:47:26.590
wanted sign of these two
individuals.

24fbd282-a40f-4f36-baee-28caf67f5185-0
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:32.157
Um, and the jails also has
somebody in a black and yellow

24fbd282-a40f-4f36-baee-28caf67f5185-1
00:47:32.157 --> 00:47:37.914
striped shirt coming out of the
fireplace, out at the top of the

24fbd282-a40f-4f36-baee-28caf67f5185-2
00:47:37.914 --> 00:47:43.229
fireplace, and that takes you
right out onto the top of the

24fbd282-a40f-4f36-baee-28caf67f5185-3
00:47:43.229 --> 00:47:48.721
house and into the hotel part of
the area. And so the hotel's

24fbd282-a40f-4f36-baee-28caf67f5185-4
00:47:48.721 --> 00:47:54.124
orange, and there seems to be
people that are smoking or not

24fbd282-a40f-4f36-baee-28caf67f5185-5
00:47:54.124 --> 00:47:56.870
smoking. They're shooting guns.

71205358-0125-4f65-92f8-3a54b6097966-0
00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.880
Because a one woman is shooting
2 guns.

1ec95a62-5ab6-4ff6-9e3c-5326f3923487-0
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.874
Kind of like you. And so she
has, she can kind of tell

1ec95a62-5ab6-4ff6-9e3c-5326f3923487-1
00:48:04.874 --> 00:48:09.579
because there is smoke coming
out from either side of her and

1ec95a62-5ab6-4ff6-9e3c-5326f3923487-2
00:48:09.579 --> 00:48:14.133
she's in a yellow dress and
people are ducking under tables

1ec95a62-5ab6-4ff6-9e3c-5326f3923487-3
00:48:14.133 --> 00:48:18.915
and they're sitting and watching
and just kind of getting away

1ec95a62-5ab6-4ff6-9e3c-5326f3923487-4
00:48:18.915 --> 00:48:22.710
from her and diving onto the
ground to avoid her.

3a5d19cb-582f-486c-83c2-403145ff0ac4-0
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:29.329
Next to the hotel is the saloon.
It's a green saloon. There are

3a5d19cb-582f-486c-83c2-403145ff0ac4-1
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:33.941
two people, one in a red shirt,
red Plaid shirt with a white

3a5d19cb-582f-486c-83c2-403145ff0ac4-2
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:34.320
vest.

1a1d6e02-e149-49d8-90f8-ec6400f3897a-0
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.934
And a person in a orange shirt
with a white cowboy hat and blue

1a1d6e02-e149-49d8-90f8-ec6400f3897a-1
00:48:40.934 --> 00:48:46.190
jeans. They both have lassos and
they're just standing on top of

1a1d6e02-e149-49d8-90f8-ec6400f3897a-2
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.910
the saloon, just on top of the
saloon's roof.

4d474c62-6d76-484c-a386-bbcabc4bb24e-0
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.100
And.

32af11f3-aac8-42ea-b4b5-c236aeff1745-0
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.030
Then um.

a0022e65-c3b2-487b-82bd-9f923ea93e01-0
00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:02.273
Behind them there are like more
caravans and such like that. The

a0022e65-c3b2-487b-82bd-9f923ea93e01-1
00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:06.307
caravans seem to have some type
of like design of like red

a0022e65-c3b2-487b-82bd-9f923ea93e01-2
00:49:06.307 --> 00:49:10.545
decorations, pink decorations,
green decorations. But they're

a0022e65-c3b2-487b-82bd-9f923ea93e01-3
00:49:10.545 --> 00:49:14.852
white caravans and they've got
some type of design on them and

a0022e65-c3b2-487b-82bd-9f923ea93e01-4
00:49:14.852 --> 00:49:19.159
they're right in front of the
team east saloon. #END_wild_west

dd40bc30-20bc-4ffa-ab0d-2989b594d728-0
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.890
Umm, that was good.

af7a5d1d-153e-4e7a-bfa2-bca65f7c77ef-0
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.530
We can't move on. How are
things?

87a7cafd-2958-4020-92a0-46c15da98d22-0
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.408
I'm getting a little again. I
think it's the screen. It's

87a7cafd-2958-4020-92a0-46c15da98d22-1
00:49:32.408 --> 00:49:34.460
yeah, staring at something.

3f8946e1-24d8-4ed4-bceb-04880a49f156-0
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:46.720
I'm doing OK OK just a few more
will be good.

0c504613-9fdd-4133-918c-43ef2f6fb53e-0
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.847
This is a complex scene. Just
describe the picture to someone

0c504613-9fdd-4133-918c-43ef2f6fb53e-1
00:49:56.847 --> 00:50:00.444
who imagined that you're
describing, to someone who

0c504613-9fdd-4133-918c-43ef2f6fb53e-2
00:50:00.444 --> 00:50:04.939
cannot see it. Just describe it
as thoroughly as you can and now

0c504613-9fdd-4133-918c-43ef2f6fb53e-3
00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:06.530
keep track of the time.

28fe616f-1ac7-461b-a241-41ad203115bd-0
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.230
#START_campsite So this appears
to be.

e6ec3844-7c57-48ac-8204-acb86496ce7b-0
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.530
A.

8b87cca8-f344-4d7b-b83d-b3fed91006d8-0
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:20.785
Outdoor like beach area, so
there is not even a beach area.

8b87cca8-f344-4d7b-b83d-b3fed91006d8-1
00:50:20.785 --> 00:50:25.938
So there is a a stream that's
going through the middle of the

8b87cca8-f344-4d7b-b83d-b3fed91006d8-2
00:50:25.938 --> 00:50:30.009
picture and on one side of the
stream there are.

4334af30-0498-4a9a-ba54-9f684953fe58-0
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:35.256
Almost like camping, there are
all sorts of RVs and everything.

4334af30-0498-4a9a-ba54-9f684953fe58-1
00:50:35.256 --> 00:50:38.503
They're all set up, they're
mobile homes and then on the

4334af30-0498-4a9a-ba54-9f684953fe58-2
00:50:38.503 --> 00:50:39.130
other side.

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-0
00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:45.329
On the left side of it, there
are like tents that are being

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-1
00:50:45.329 --> 00:50:50.412
pitched and there are donkeys
and bulls that seem to be there

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-2
00:50:50.412 --> 00:50:54.675
and they're participating in
some type of like bull

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-3
00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:59.922
competition because someone has
a red, has a little red bandana

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-4
00:50:59.922 --> 00:51:04.923
and you can see angering the
ball. But going over the stream

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-5
00:51:04.923 --> 00:51:10.006
there is a bridge so people are
able to cross the stream very

f6d829db-99b6-4764-806c-08693dc257b8-6
00:51:10.006 --> 00:51:10.579
easily.

05af11bd-2c1f-4b89-8bc8-b32671941a66-0
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:16.293
And then going down the stream,
there is a little boat that has

05af11bd-2c1f-4b89-8bc8-b32671941a66-1
00:51:16.293 --> 00:51:21.253
a bunch of people that are in
very good shape. They're in

05af11bd-2c1f-4b89-8bc8-b32671941a66-2
00:51:21.253 --> 00:51:23.050
Speedos and they are.

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-0
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:29.352
Appear to be. Yeah, they appear
to all be men in Speedos.

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-1
00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:33.546
They're just waving hi to
everyone. And there are mermaids

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-2
00:51:33.546 --> 00:51:37.953
that are swimming in the stream
as people fish out off of the

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-3
00:51:37.953 --> 00:51:42.218
side of the stream. And like I
said, there's tents that are

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-4
00:51:42.218 --> 00:51:46.128
pitched and so people are
sitting outside. There's one

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-5
00:51:46.128 --> 00:51:50.535
tent that is has floral prints
and outside of that print, out

97043a24-578c-4827-8312-f9a8575fcbd1-6
00:51:50.535 --> 00:51:54.799
of that tent, there are people
that are playing the guitar.

d2ab1b60-4019-4780-a9b4-c461cb19630b-0
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:58.110
And they're very, very
hippie-esque. If they all have

d2ab1b60-4019-4780-a9b4-c461cb19630b-1
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:01.590
really long hair, they're
playing the guitar and then the

d2ab1b60-4019-4780-a9b4-c461cb19630b-2
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:05.430
and the one next to it has all
these little kids around it. And

d2ab1b60-4019-4780-a9b4-c461cb19630b-3
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:09.150
it looks like whoever is trying
to pitch the tent is having a

d2ab1b60-4019-4780-a9b4-c461cb19630b-4
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:12.510
really tough time of it because
the tent is not pitched

d2ab1b60-4019-4780-a9b4-c461cb19630b-5
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:13.530
correctly at all.

fcd62554-deea-4ebd-af23-ab5920f1c687-0
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.681
But it looks to be like there
are like one side of the left

fcd62554-deea-4ebd-af23-ab5920f1c687-1
00:52:20.681 --> 00:52:25.746
side of the stream are people
that are camping, and there are

fcd62554-deea-4ebd-af23-ab5920f1c687-2
00:52:25.746 --> 00:52:30.892
people with backpacks and wooden
sticks and hiking sticks that

fcd62554-deea-4ebd-af23-ab5920f1c687-3
00:52:30.892 --> 00:52:35.712
seem to be crawling in some
places. And um walking in some

fcd62554-deea-4ebd-af23-ab5920f1c687-4
00:52:35.712 --> 00:52:39.470
places just overly exhausted
with and they're

6a8ca164-0eeb-4c80-966d-3b456bb214c8-0
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:46.215
This kind of camping they're,
they look really exhausted. You

6a8ca164-0eeb-4c80-966d-3b456bb214c8-1
00:52:46.215 --> 00:52:51.002
can kind of tell from the way
their tongues are hanging out.

6a8ca164-0eeb-4c80-966d-3b456bb214c8-2
00:52:51.002 --> 00:52:55.945
They're panting. And then on the
other side it looks much more

6a8ca164-0eeb-4c80-966d-3b456bb214c8-3
00:52:55.945 --> 00:53:00.968
vacation and like picturesque.
There's a Boy Scout troop that's

6a8ca164-0eeb-4c80-966d-3b456bb214c8-4
00:53:00.968 --> 00:53:05.912
over on the right side to the
farthest right part of the page.

6a8ca164-0eeb-4c80-966d-3b456bb214c8-5
00:53:05.912 --> 00:53:07.559
They have all of the.

dd468688-0edd-4c83-afef-fa19422e2732-0
00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.779
Little kids are saluting an
adult. They all have little

dd468688-0edd-4c83-afef-fa19422e2732-1
00:53:12.779 --> 00:53:16.632
green bandanas and they all have
their heads. They're all

dd468688-0edd-4c83-afef-fa19422e2732-2
00:53:16.632 --> 00:53:17.230
saluting.

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-0
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.977
Whatever leader that may be, but
he's not wearing a green

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-1
00:53:22.977 --> 00:53:27.221
bandana. And so they're pitch,
they're making fire out of like

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-2
00:53:27.221 --> 00:53:31.397
firewood and everything. And
then when you get to the RVs and

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-3
00:53:31.397 --> 00:53:35.304
everything, there is one that
somebody has clearly cooked

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-4
00:53:35.304 --> 00:53:39.414
something poorly because there's
smoke coming out of it. But

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-5
00:53:39.414 --> 00:53:43.590
there are also families, Oh no,
there's families grilling and

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-6
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:47.969
the smoke is going into that RV
and that RV, like they look very

c9a02ce9-987b-462f-a0d5-4ab1c94b1bff-7
00:53:47.969 --> 00:53:48.980
upset about it.

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-0
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.136
And there's another RV that's
grilling that it's a green space

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-1
00:53:55.136 --> 00:53:59.285
with a pink top, which is very
cool. I like the colors a lot.

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-2
00:53:59.285 --> 00:54:03.368
So yeah, that's the only thing
is that these spaces, they're

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-3
00:54:03.368 --> 00:54:07.651
kind of sectioned off. There's a
white path that's going around

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-4
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:12.068
the entire outer side for people
to bike on for walk on. And then

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-5
00:54:12.068 --> 00:54:16.217
there's green spaces that are
designated by a green Bush that

583e0bf5-c1b1-473d-8fad-a1fa8cc44a5b-6
00:54:16.217 --> 00:54:19.430
goes all the way around the
perimeter and it's.

fc6321c3-a273-4412-ac1f-3a0b97db0538-0
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.540
Light green in the middle.

8b55d306-518b-49bb-821d-7654f394c3d8-0
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:26.861
And so you could kind of tell
that it's all sectioned off by

8b55d306-518b-49bb-821d-7654f394c3d8-1
00:54:26.861 --> 00:54:30.441
the green shrub that is like on
the outside, and then the light

8b55d306-518b-49bb-821d-7654f394c3d8-2
00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:33.796
green space on the inside is
where people are all gathering

8b55d306-518b-49bb-821d-7654f394c3d8-3
00:54:33.796 --> 00:54:34.580
on the inside.

0586d1e3-eb01-4389-bd46-38c315af1854-0
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.433
And there's also another RV that
has red and white stripes on

0586d1e3-eb01-4389-bd46-38c315af1854-1
00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:46.430
their awning, and that awning is
open.

7940cd08-0515-46cb-8962-a1f51a2e1671-0
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:52.863
There are people that are riding
their bikes, we see a dog, we

7940cd08-0515-46cb-8962-a1f51a2e1671-1
00:54:52.863 --> 00:54:58.109
see somebody that is looks like
in a gondola that got hit by the

7940cd08-0515-46cb-8962-a1f51a2e1671-2
00:54:58.109 --> 00:55:02.950
bridge that looks like they are
going to lose their gondola

7940cd08-0515-46cb-8962-a1f51a2e1671-3
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:07.873
paddle and fall into the water
and and people look confused.

7940cd08-0515-46cb-8962-a1f51a2e1671-4
00:55:07.873 --> 00:55:12.311
And then there looks to be a
submarine top with a duck

7940cd08-0515-46cb-8962-a1f51a2e1671-5
00:55:12.311 --> 00:55:15.620
standing on the submarine
lookout space.

a6b52166-1c49-4506-bb84-c2e5837b9bf2-0
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.490
And there's a shark fin as well.
#END_campsite OK, great.

b4aaef10-9e56-4ac0-ba04-bc23d8e494e0-0
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.270
OK.

2989c420-be9d-441a-98b8-c5395a19d2d2-0
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.910
OK, moving on to the next item,
it's a.

c3d7c1d3-1907-4789-9d20-7fa2e57a8a09-0
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.930
Other complex scenes like.

8b136538-0697-42bb-a670-ebfd92b42165-0
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.610
#START_escape_from_the_zoo So
this is at this zoo.

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-0
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:43.946
And we see off the get go, there
are giraffes that are there.

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-1
00:55:43.946 --> 00:55:48.382
This is the zoo, and they're
stealing. There's a lot of chaos

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-2
00:55:48.382 --> 00:55:52.962
going on they're stealing like
some food from people. There's a

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-3
00:55:52.962 --> 00:55:56.897
rhinoceros that is chasing
people off of the path that

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-4
00:55:56.897 --> 00:56:01.119
everybody walks on on there.
When you're at the zoo, there

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-5
00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:05.412
are several different types of
enclosures, and so there's a

a55838ae-e6a6-4a65-9e53-ec6340e4ffde-6
00:56:05.412 --> 00:56:09.419
space in the middle and a
rhinoceros have gotten loose.

c2813a33-9682-491f-b2f4-fe1a0fc90bbf-0
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.675
From the space in the enclosure
and children are leaping into

c2813a33-9682-491f-b2f4-fe1a0fc90bbf-1
00:56:13.675 --> 00:56:17.658
the lion's den enclosure.
They're dropping into the lion's

c2813a33-9682-491f-b2f4-fe1a0fc90bbf-2
00:56:17.658 --> 00:56:21.439
den enclosure and the lion is
licking his lips. He's so

c2813a33-9682-491f-b2f4-fe1a0fc90bbf-3
00:56:21.439 --> 00:56:23.330
excited to eat the children.

29b183ef-c62c-4a2f-a024-235962db5368-0
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.719
There's also a Peacock that is
walking around in the adult and

29b183ef-c62c-4a2f-a024-235962db5368-1
00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:32.382
like in the space that everybody
walks around and there's

29b183ef-c62c-4a2f-a024-235962db5368-2
00:56:32.382 --> 00:56:34.530
somebody that's selling hot
dogs.

f97664f3-671a-41d6-9a84-3e5805b56112-0
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:36.640
And um.

cd0511f1-a678-46db-ad96-6f44dc4a201e-0
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:43.265
In the safari area there are
some zebra, there are three

cd0511f1-a678-46db-ad96-6f44dc4a201e-1
00:56:43.265 --> 00:56:46.480
flamingos and a hippopotamus,
and.

7339c374-0491-4326-9d1f-1c58a09c0021-0
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:53.680
Then there's also two lemurs
that are hanging out from a tree

7339c374-0491-4326-9d1f-1c58a09c0021-1
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.903
and they're looking up at a a
weirdly colored green bird. Very

7339c374-0491-4326-9d1f-1c58a09c0021-2
00:56:58.903 --> 00:57:04.126
confused. In the middle of the
enclosure there is a looks like

7339c374-0491-4326-9d1f-1c58a09c0021-3
00:57:04.126 --> 00:57:09.267
we're Penguins would be, but we
don't see any animals. It's a

7339c374-0491-4326-9d1f-1c58a09c0021-4
00:57:09.267 --> 00:57:14.407
snowy type of enclosure. We can
see it's icy and there's very

7339c374-0491-4326-9d1f-1c58a09c0021-5
00:57:14.407 --> 00:57:18.470
clearly a like little holes and
steps with snow.

6bfaee9c-e951-4796-84e6-269634b5dc8b-0
00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.655
I don't see any of the animals,
so I don't know what they went,

6bfaee9c-e951-4796-84e6-269634b5dc8b-1
00:57:22.655 --> 00:57:26.438
but it can't be good. And then
behind there there's a polar

6bfaee9c-e951-4796-84e6-269634b5dc8b-2
00:57:26.438 --> 00:57:30.410
bear enclosure with three polar
bears. One of them is swimming

6bfaee9c-e951-4796-84e6-269634b5dc8b-3
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:31.230
in the water.

45da1509-e6d9-4298-b0ac-57a0552a81b6-0
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:37.421
In way in the back there is an
elephant and it looks like a

45da1509-e6d9-4298-b0ac-57a0552a81b6-1
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:42.578
rhino and an ostrich, and the
elephant is snorting peanuts, or

45da1509-e6d9-4298-b0ac-57a0552a81b6-2
00:57:42.578 --> 00:57:47.408
at is sucking up the peanuts
from somebody that was behind

45da1509-e6d9-4298-b0ac-57a0552a81b6-3
00:57:47.408 --> 00:57:47.899
there.

98ed2704-a45b-4ecf-bc00-6515f2197233-0
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:53.446
There is a kangaroo that's
bouncing around in the enclosure

98ed2704-a45b-4ecf-bc00-6515f2197233-1
00:57:53.446 --> 00:57:57.569
and outside of the enclosure
space it's just bouncing around

98ed2704-a45b-4ecf-bc00-6515f2197233-2
00:57:57.569 --> 00:57:57.840
and.

08c2d207-dc80-4187-ac73-cd9ececc625e-0
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.180
People look frightened.

6b517639-6131-4ab8-8faf-1220a1a8885d-0
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:04.691
And then on top of there,
there's also a cafe and and in

6b517639-6131-4ab8-8faf-1220a1a8885d-1
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:08.558
front of the cafe is an ice
cream shop that looks like an

6b517639-6131-4ab8-8faf-1220a1a8885d-2
00:58:08.558 --> 00:58:12.826
ice cream cone, which says the
words ice cream on it and so on.

6b517639-6131-4ab8-8faf-1220a1a8885d-3
00:58:12.826 --> 00:58:16.961
And so like ice cream. So got a
lot of the zoo food. And then

6b517639-6131-4ab8-8faf-1220a1a8885d-4
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:21.028
there's a cafe with several
types of birds, there's looks to

6b517639-6131-4ab8-8faf-1220a1a8885d-5
00:58:21.028 --> 00:58:24.630
be an eagle, a parakeet and some
types of Black bird.

98357d6a-d3f1-4378-9297-b5e05f61d136-0
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:30.925
There are designs all around of
flags with animals on them. To

98357d6a-d3f1-4378-9297-b5e05f61d136-1
00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:35.740
to show that this is the zoo
area, there's a gift shop.

8afa9c48-f171-4f4d-aef5-60da70d465bc-0
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:40.260
And next to the gift shop is all
the gorillas. There seems to be

8afa9c48-f171-4f4d-aef5-60da70d465bc-1
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.468
a child impersonating a gorilla
or the gorilla's impersonating

8afa9c48-f171-4f4d-aef5-60da70d465bc-2
00:58:43.468 --> 00:58:46.625
the child and waving their arms
up and down and shaking their

8afa9c48-f171-4f4d-aef5-60da70d465bc-3
00:58:46.625 --> 00:58:46.880
legs.

8e3d6d33-eb31-4c56-bcc6-51e2d43ec204-0
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:55.739
And there's also a Penguin that
is flying a red and blue little

8e3d6d33-eb31-4c56-bcc6-51e2d43ec204-1
00:58:55.739 --> 00:59:04.010

parakeet, parakeet and chasing a

97d12b2a-a87e-47be-99e7-d3763ed09a97-0
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:08.865
Penguin and yeah, it's a day at
the zoo.

97d12b2a-a87e-47be-99e7-d3763ed09a97-1
00:59:08.865 --> 00:59:12.660
#END_escape_from_the_zoo
Alright, OK, cool.

06e97a54-4420-4a3b-9e37-3d72c1eb1648-0
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:17.570
So next we are moving on to.

ba410e82-54b7-4187-bc80-6f198930ab1e-0
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.650
Another scene.

dc1fb220-5911-496f-b0ec-03bc723a65b4-0
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:31.615
#START_deep_sea_divers All
right, so this is a water scene.

dc1fb220-5911-496f-b0ec-03bc723a65b4-1
00:59:31.615 --> 00:59:35.744
Above the water, there are
several people, so it's split

dc1fb220-5911-496f-b0ec-03bc723a65b4-2
00:59:35.744 --> 00:59:40.017
between the top half of the

dc1fb220-5911-496f-b0ec-03bc723a65b4-3
00:59:40.017 --> 00:59:44.435
of scene, and the bottom half of
the page is what's going on

dc1fb220-5911-496f-b0ec-03bc723a65b4-4
00:59:44.435 --> 00:59:44.870
below.

f146530f-9881-457e-a479-dd24d4d1f4cc-0
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:50.283
And at the top of above the
water, there are rocks that

f146530f-9881-457e-a479-dd24d4d1f4cc-1
00:59:50.283 --> 00:59:52.520
people are on their fishing.

9cf4bca9-b680-4d78-ba4e-ae6f7e1966a4-0
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:58.239
And some of the rocks are
actually whales in disguise, and

9cf4bca9-b680-4d78-ba4e-ae6f7e1966a4-1
00:59:58.239 --> 01:00:02.030
the whales are attempting to eat
some of the people.

300bcee8-fe73-40c7-9001-2e78dea334cb-0
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:06.676
And but a lot of the time
they're like there's some

300bcee8-fe73-40c7-9001-2e78dea334cb-1
01:00:06.676 --> 01:00:09.881
mermaids on one of the rocks
that's king Triton. He's

300bcee8-fe73-40c7-9001-2e78dea334cb-2
01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:11.900
pushing, that's holding a
Triton.

f59455e6-4eb4-4127-bd29-3c7c6771e067-0
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:17.616
Fish are leaping over the rocks
and but mostly there's just a

f59455e6-4eb4-4127-bd29-3c7c6771e067-1
01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:21.862
lot of people sitting on rocks.
Fishing people are fishing in

f59455e6-4eb4-4127-bd29-3c7c6771e067-2
01:00:21.862 --> 01:00:26.177
boats all around off the top of
the water. They're all, all of

f59455e6-4eb4-4127-bd29-3c7c6771e067-3
01:00:26.177 --> 01:00:30.013
the boats are striped and
they're either blue or red or

f59455e6-4eb4-4127-bd29-3c7c6771e067-4
01:00:30.013 --> 01:00:34.328
green, but they're all over the
place and they're all fishing.

f59455e6-4eb4-4127-bd29-3c7c6771e067-5
01:00:34.328 --> 01:00:36.520
And then below the water we see.

588dfd6e-cbdc-4ee2-9517-8c67d4e7dc6c-0
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:43.390
Um, several. Several fish are
doing bizarre things. So.

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-0
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:48.734
Some of the people have been
sucked down to the bottom by

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-1
01:00:48.734 --> 01:00:53.513
some of these fish that have
pulled on their line little too

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-2
01:00:53.513 --> 01:00:58.449
hard. So there's one session in
particular, it's a yellow fish

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-3
01:00:58.449 --> 01:01:03.384
that is pulling down like four
or five people off of that, all

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-4
01:01:03.384 --> 01:01:08.555
holding on to a fishing rod. The
fish are also looking to capture

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-5
01:01:08.555 --> 01:01:13.726
some of the people, so there's a
fish is that's pink that has its

4ab15458-8a1d-40d9-887b-939915a61372-6
01:01:13.726 --> 01:01:14.040
own.

c5b8c53b-274f-45b5-b524-380c17058c52-0
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.271
Fishing net that looks to be
capturing the people the fish

c5b8c53b-274f-45b5-b524-380c17058c52-1
01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:24.468
are in very and then the people
have to be tied down to the

c5b8c53b-274f-45b5-b524-380c17058c52-2
01:01:24.468 --> 01:01:29.666
bottom of the ocean by rock by
these satchels of some sort.

c5b8c53b-274f-45b5-b524-380c17058c52-3
01:01:29.666 --> 01:01:35.037
They have like sacks on them,
like yellow sacks that are tied

c5b8c53b-274f-45b5-b524-380c17058c52-4
01:01:35.037 --> 01:01:36.769
around their bodies.

30d3c77b-b8a4-4d2f-a9de-b28576f07d2c-0
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.064
And they're all kind of standing
at the bottom of the ocean. So

30d3c77b-b8a4-4d2f-a9de-b28576f07d2c-1
01:01:42.064 --> 01:01:45.824
it's very weird. There's an
octopus down there. The fish are

30d3c77b-b8a4-4d2f-a9de-b28576f07d2c-2
01:01:45.824 --> 01:01:49.891
in several different designs. So
there's a fish that's, there's a

30d3c77b-b8a4-4d2f-a9de-b28576f07d2c-3
01:01:49.891 --> 01:01:53.712
group of fish that are in the
shape of a smiley face. There's

30d3c77b-b8a4-4d2f-a9de-b28576f07d2c-4
01:01:53.712 --> 01:01:57.718
a group of fish that are in the
shape of fish. There's a rainbow

30d3c77b-b8a4-4d2f-a9de-b28576f07d2c-5
01:01:57.718 --> 01:01:58.889
fish that is being.

d3133d88-4753-413f-aeef-e592267edcd0-0
01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:07.108
That has gotten caught on a hook
and is being pulled up to giant

d3133d88-4753-413f-aeef-e592267edcd0-1
01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:10.600
rainbow fish. And then there are
just.

b0fecb51-be5c-4e4e-9bb4-6b96f29988cf-0
01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.080
Most again everybody that is a
person is in a green, red or

b0fecb51-be5c-4e4e-9bb4-6b96f29988cf-1
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.688
blue striped swimsuit. You can
easily distinguish them from the

b0fecb51-be5c-4e4e-9bb4-6b96f29988cf-2
01:02:21.688 --> 01:02:26.152
other fish and some mermaids.
The mermaids all have tails, so

b0fecb51-be5c-4e4e-9bb4-6b96f29988cf-3
01:02:26.152 --> 01:02:30.904
it kind of appears as the people
are attacking the fish up above.

b0fecb51-be5c-4e4e-9bb4-6b96f29988cf-4
01:02:30.904 --> 01:02:34.000
The fish are also attacking them
so below.

5cc2f33d-aaff-406c-aff4-bee4d75dd802-0
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:41.428
There's a group of green fish
that are all spinning kind of in

5cc2f33d-aaff-406c-aff4-bee4d75dd802-1
01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:45.868
a they're all kind of going tail
to tail. There's four or five of

5cc2f33d-aaff-406c-aff4-bee4d75dd802-2
01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:50.039
them, but the humps of their
back from the top make them look

5cc2f33d-aaff-406c-aff4-bee4d75dd802-3
01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:53.538
like they're serpents. But
they're actually several

5cc2f33d-aaff-406c-aff4-bee4d75dd802-4
01:02:53.538 --> 01:02:56.699
different groups of fish.

01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:59.100
And.

2f71562d-1cd4-4c90-aadd-f507e16d7721-0
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:05.100
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

87bd0006-4df0-4087-bdee-c1d9ad429613-0
01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:12.389
I think that this won't be that
last one here. Let me grab that

87bd0006-4df0-4087-bdee-c1d9ad429613-1
01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:17.047
real quick and that will be the
the next one will be the last

87bd0006-4df0-4087-bdee-c1d9ad429613-2
01:03:17.047 --> 01:03:18.250
one we do today.

ed908c7e-933c-4acb-9071-964e3d957f26-0
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:26.460
Delete.

4f158b2e-08e1-4073-9959-adacf862ee5f-0
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.630
So when I make future
appointments, how do I do that?

d44831c5-044a-4364-9a99-251ad136c8b1-0
01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:38.756
We will. We can talk about that
today if you have your schedule

d44831c5-044a-4364-9a99-251ad136c8b1-1
01:03:38.756 --> 01:03:42.907
decided for the next few weeks.
Otherwise if you still have

d44831c5-044a-4364-9a99-251ad136c8b1-2
01:03:42.907 --> 01:03:47.333
uncertainty, you can definitely
actually we will not do another

d44831c5-044a-4364-9a99-251ad136c8b1-3
01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:51.484
one today because the next one
will be quite long and there

d44831c5-044a-4364-9a99-251ad136c8b1-4
01:03:51.484 --> 01:03:52.660
will go overtime.

ce8eb0c9-e96a-4914-8a50-400f6f01fc16-0
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.221
Yeah, we'll do, we'll do another
one. I'm pretty free. I'll let

ce8eb0c9-e96a-4914-8a50-400f6f01fc16-1
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:03.523
you know my availability at the
end. OK, let's do another item.

ce8eb0c9-e96a-4914-8a50-400f6f01fc16-2
01:04:03.523 --> 01:04:05.070
This one is quite long.

18f98866-250a-4b95-9426-8e78447608c3-0
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:11.140
Um, the pages are a bit longer,
so for each page.

b1ffa9c5-a7fd-4b30-9e5a-6d3ab53ad408-0
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:17.594
Just spends less time than you
have done so far so that we the

b1ffa9c5-a7fd-4b30-9e5a-6d3ab53ad408-1
01:04:17.594 --> 01:04:22.978
pages are a little bit longer
right there. A lot more pages

b1ffa9c5-a7fd-4b30-9e5a-6d3ab53ad408-2
01:04:22.978 --> 01:04:26.119
for this particular graphic
novel.

9bb6248d-4ea8-4a8f-9522-c970e18f51bb-0
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:27.370
You're right.

247aab7f-f1e0-4085-a958-9c3d86d9e5d5-0
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.590
Yes.

f23529de-f0de-4302-809f-aaa2f62724ea-0
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.200
Here.

dd80eac1-91b8-4cee-abde-64e9c37d6045-0
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.600
That will stop at three.

18f3cc5f-f582-435a-ab83-f313f289c57e-0
01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.120
OK.

8ee79bc6-b781-445e-bef2-dfad8f2825d5-0
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:44.860
Alright.

b0b568a6-379e-45a7-a7cf-6aaf35416fff-0
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.440
#START_wanderer Um, so there are
two people?

daf7c081-c4a9-424f-891b-2a34e394a02d-0
01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:54.576
There is somebody that is
dressed in all black suit with a

daf7c081-c4a9-424f-891b-2a34e394a02d-1
01:04:54.576 --> 01:04:58.260
horn, a half moon horn coming
out of their head and they look

daf7c081-c4a9-424f-891b-2a34e394a02d-2
01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.826
this other person than any
stripe shirt and so they look to

daf7c081-c4a9-424f-891b-2a34e394a02d-3
01:05:01.826 --> 01:05:02.480
be folding.

7702988c-97d7-49b5-92c9-cac618bcf17b-0
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.868
Um, a sheet of paper over and
over and making a paper

7702988c-97d7-49b5-92c9-cac618bcf17b-1
01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:12.750
sailboat. Once they've completed
the paper sailboat, they.

154d8eaa-38c1-405a-ae2a-bb1ff99f8003-0
01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:18.913
It looks like they jump into it
and are up against a giant giant

154d8eaa-38c1-405a-ae2a-bb1ff99f8003-1
01:05:18.913 --> 01:05:22.789
sailboat. Looks like part
submarine, part giant sailboat,

154d8eaa-38c1-405a-ae2a-bb1ff99f8003-2
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.990
so.

15417d31-09a6-4ee3-a28f-e9cab0d8c43f-0
01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.283
Yeah, and as they look up,
there's their paper sailboat

15417d31-09a6-4ee3-a28f-e9cab0d8c43f-1
01:05:28.283 --> 01:05:32.077
floating by, and there are all
sorts of birds that are up

15417d31-09a6-4ee3-a28f-e9cab0d8c43f-2
01:05:32.077 --> 01:05:34.889
above, flying above them. Vast
open ocean.

69d93177-d47b-4786-8683-cb698da14496-0
01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:42.065
And as they're on the paper
sailboat, there's several

69d93177-d47b-4786-8683-cb698da14496-1
01:05:42.065 --> 01:05:46.445
different types of animals that
are coming up to them. So there

69d93177-d47b-4786-8683-cb698da14496-2
01:05:46.445 --> 01:05:50.346
are some sea turtles and a
whale. It looks like a whale.

69d93177-d47b-4786-8683-cb698da14496-3
01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.810
Maybe it's the whale, I don't
know.

a433bf5c-a817-4b73-b47c-e43517a80ee9-0
01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.036
But they're all different
patterns, so they with

a433bf5c-a817-4b73-b47c-e43517a80ee9-1
01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.670
checkered. It is. It looks like
an orca whale.

34ba3017-e6c7-46be-8b12-8c52a1d7a7aa-0
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:05.479
Almost optical illusion or the
whale and orca whale picks up

34ba3017-e6c7-46be-8b12-8c52a1d7a7aa-1
01:06:05.479 --> 01:06:09.595
the paper sailboat and flies
towards a coral reef that is

34ba3017-e6c7-46be-8b12-8c52a1d7a7aa-2
01:06:09.595 --> 01:06:13.925
actually just an amalgamation of
multiple different types of

34ba3017-e6c7-46be-8b12-8c52a1d7a7aa-3
01:06:13.925 --> 01:06:14.280
fish.

982fe20c-0292-4870-95d7-6f85591f8d35-0
01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:22.291
And so on this coral reef,
that's like 17 different types

982fe20c-0292-4870-95d7-6f85591f8d35-1
01:06:22.291 --> 01:06:24.580
of fish on the top are just.

423c015d-2cf7-4cf9-8765-3ac3584dd1b2-0
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.212
Regular fish, but then as you
get deeper, the paper sailboat

423c015d-2cf7-4cf9-8765-3ac3584dd1b2-1
01:06:29.212 --> 01:06:30.540
kind of floats on them.

eb26749d-d280-458e-8c82-341b76e447a6-0
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:36.165
But you really do see that it's
all just kind of built up around

eb26749d-d280-458e-8c82-341b76e447a6-1
01:06:36.165 --> 01:06:39.728
all of these fish and the coral
reef is just built up of the

eb26749d-d280-458e-8c82-341b76e447a6-2
01:06:39.728 --> 01:06:40.019
fish.

ac94e683-56a4-446b-b69b-464275b3be5f-0
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:47.311
And then you have fish that are
kissing each other and they look

ac94e683-56a4-446b-b69b-464275b3be5f-1
01:06:47.311 --> 01:06:51.630
almost like aliens. There's
somebody, one of them has shears

ac94e683-56a4-446b-b69b-464275b3be5f-2
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:55.807
and they look to be cutting
their grass, but they all look

ac94e683-56a4-446b-b69b-464275b3be5f-3
01:06:55.807 --> 01:07:00.196
pretty surprised. And the paper
boat lowers a fishing rod and

ac94e683-56a4-446b-b69b-464275b3be5f-4
01:07:00.196 --> 01:07:04.232
ends up catching one of the
fish. And everybody was very

ac94e683-56a4-446b-b69b-464275b3be5f-5
01:07:04.232 --> 01:07:04.940
concerned.

d3013f92-a98c-4810-8d0b-92af6ca41e53-0
01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:13.589
Umm, so some of the fish got to
take a look at the sailboat. One

d3013f92-a98c-4810-8d0b-92af6ca41e53-1
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:18.318
of them is in a pattern and has
its own sailboat had of its own,

d3013f92-a98c-4810-8d0b-92af6ca41e53-2
01:07:18.318 --> 01:07:22.830
and he hopped on his sailboat
and they start flying over the.

7dbe9729-4aa1-4524-ab81-429246075c36-0
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.390
What are those called?

1dda0357-04b0-4286-b3bf-84ddb144f569-0
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:32.664
Umm, they are flat with little
faces and their names are

1dda0357-04b0-4286-b3bf-84ddb144f569-1
01:07:32.664 --> 01:07:37.160
escaping me right now. Pranks.
No, they are.

a3267ebd-842c-4a42-a3db-c1537fc6cb8a-0
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.960
Yeah, that is fine.

1b80bb2a-c18c-4325-9660-901917ecdd30-0
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:46.612
But they are. And then they get
to a forest that is filled with

1b80bb2a-c18c-4325-9660-901917ecdd30-1
01:07:46.612 --> 01:07:50.920
all sorts of types of different
Swans and such.

fd0cdb9e-ee7f-462f-b6fc-f367f9058e61-0
01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:55.060
And yeah, but there's like.

04f80342-142e-40a8-84bb-e4f2dee9050c-0
01:07:56.150 --> 01:08:01.387
geese or Swans and starts to go
through the paper boat's It

04f80342-142e-40a8-84bb-e4f2dee9050c-1
01:08:01.387 --> 01:08:03.220
starts to go through.

a3d5e2f5-edea-4344-9f59-4d8137e8696c-0
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.995
All of these different patterns
of Swans and geese and it's

a3d5e2f5-edea-4344-9f59-4d8137e8696c-1
01:08:08.995 --> 01:08:09.370
just.

be9dcc9f-dd3d-4d2a-9ce4-08bc04a20d68-0
01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:14.474
Woodland area with it looks
almost marshy, looks like a

be9dcc9f-dd3d-4d2a-9ce4-08bc04a20d68-1
01:08:14.474 --> 01:08:14.880
marsh.

16ce1bf5-5aac-4e39-ab35-5bc528fc0a28-0
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.320
And there seems to be some
creatures with bright eyes

16ce1bf5-5aac-4e39-ab35-5bc528fc0a28-1
01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.401
lurking in this marshy area that
are trying to they're all high,

16ce1bf5-5aac-4e39-ab35-5bc528fc0a28-2
01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:32.935
kind of hidden. There's like
lizards, they're they're all

16ce1bf5-5aac-4e39-ab35-5bc528fc0a28-3
01:08:32.935 --> 01:08:37.469
kind of hidden within and
disguised as trees, and they're

16ce1bf5-5aac-4e39-ab35-5bc528fc0a28-4
01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:41.690
just looking down and almost
biting at the paper hat.

cd829a41-6dc9-4c0e-a644-9b1a53082b30-0
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:47.348
The paper boat as the fish sit
failed by in it, the fish failed

cd829a41-6dc9-4c0e-a644-9b1a53082b30-1
01:08:47.348 --> 01:08:52.018
by in it and then see some some
of his own kind. And so he jumps

cd829a41-6dc9-4c0e-a644-9b1a53082b30-2
01:08:52.018 --> 01:08:56.473
out to go be with them and he
says, oh I know those guys. And

cd829a41-6dc9-4c0e-a644-9b1a53082b30-3
01:08:56.473 --> 01:08:59.060
so he comes out to go be with
them.

c13173f3-59d5-416b-b94e-7c13783b12f6-0
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:09.090
And as the boat goes by, it
passes a big giant whale.

4cd3303a-e65d-4d4e-8010-89946da3bbf0-0
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:17.342
And almost like a beluga whale
or something or something, but

4cd3303a-e65d-4d4e-8010-89946da3bbf0-1
01:09:17.342 --> 01:09:18.700
the whale is.

51869730-4d63-4fd7-b35f-216a9b28b23a-0
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:25.582
Has part of its head sticking
out and it's smoking a pipe, and

51869730-4d63-4fd7-b35f-216a9b28b23a-1
01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:30.765
then it keeps going by and it
sees this monster crab monster

51869730-4d63-4fd7-b35f-216a9b28b23a-2
01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:31.869
of some sort.

b6a2c411-c8fa-43af-bb78-b9118860373a-0
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.428
Standing on a a like a ton of
different shipwreck boats that

b6a2c411-c8fa-43af-bb78-b9118860373a-1
01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:43.452
have all been gathered on top of
one another and the boat paper

b6a2c411-c8fa-43af-bb78-b9118860373a-2
01:09:43.452 --> 01:09:45.180
boat keeps sailing on.

a4466349-e31a-4da7-8232-a6bc435967e4-0
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:49.510
Um.

8bc6a547-0ce3-4e10-a157-b3ac4f517106-0
01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:56.970
And the paper boat keeps sailing
on towards the sun and you see

8bc6a547-0ce3-4e10-a157-b3ac4f517106-1
01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:02.745
all sorts of these different
animals. We see elephants that

8bc6a547-0ce3-4e10-a157-b3ac4f517106-2
01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:03.130
are.

c7c5f461-7383-4c17-a707-0b4ccbdc4225-0
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:10.078
Look like fish and lions that
look like fish, and seahorses

c7c5f461-7383-4c17-a707-0b4ccbdc4225-1
01:10:10.078 --> 01:10:15.978
that look like horses. There's
cheetah fish. There are catfish

c7c5f461-7383-4c17-a707-0b4ccbdc4225-2
01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:21.316
and dogfish and zebra fish and
clown fish that look like

c7c5f461-7383-4c17-a707-0b4ccbdc4225-3
01:10:21.316 --> 01:10:27.215
clowns. And there are crocodile
fish that look like crocodiles

c7c5f461-7383-4c17-a707-0b4ccbdc4225-4
01:10:27.215 --> 01:10:32.834
and butterfly fish that look
like butterflies and bird fish

c7c5f461-7383-4c17-a707-0b4ccbdc4225-5
01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.520
and even the moon.

735de1e8-a7a8-4748-a7fb-9d21582f33b4-0
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:36.850
Kind of looks like it has some
some gills.

8814665a-b68b-4cb9-872e-682f45af76cc-0
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.147
And as the boat keeps going on,
you see it looks like the sky is

8814665a-b68b-4cb9-872e-682f45af76cc-1
01:10:44.147 --> 01:10:48.102
so starry, but then below you
see it's actually just the eyes

8814665a-b68b-4cb9-872e-682f45af76cc-2
01:10:48.102 --> 01:10:52.249
of all these different types of
fish that are coming towards the

8814665a-b68b-4cb9-872e-682f45af76cc-3
01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:52.760
surface.

149cf9c0-71c8-49d3-83ba-74ad64aa2908-0
01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:02.269
And they're all staring at the
boat and their eyes are just so

149cf9c0-71c8-49d3-83ba-74ad64aa2908-1
01:11:02.269 --> 01:11:06.950
wide and they're just amazed um
at this boat.

5c6a8ced-04f2-414e-a4f3-4d32b01883cb-0
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.874
And then you see Aurora Borealis
that is up in the sky as the

5c6a8ced-04f2-414e-a4f3-4d32b01883cb-1
01:11:14.874 --> 01:11:19.990
boat continues on, which means
that it's passed a lot of time.

e9e4193f-e479-46c1-81ad-f7b844cdfe66-0
01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:25.200
And then you get to a glacier.

e53c283b-f9a9-4edd-b43b-d7d14e7315aa-0
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:29.400
And it was, yeah.

c4f157e6-2a39-4a41-90b3-728134b7cf68-0
01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:34.333
Yeah. And then as it goes
through these other different

c4f157e6-2a39-4a41-90b3-728134b7cf68-1
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:38.480
types of sculptures, so
sculptures it's landmarks, looks

c4f157e6-2a39-4a41-90b3-728134b7cf68-2
01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.917
like an ice or rock type of
Tavern and the boat is just kind

c4f157e6-2a39-4a41-90b3-728134b7cf68-3
01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:44.300
of sailing through.

c3a52f90-470e-4b07-8a24-3129e245428d-0
01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.453
And then once it comes out, a
light shines upon it. Almost

c3a52f90-470e-4b07-8a24-3129e245428d-1
01:11:53.453 --> 01:11:58.257
from a ship it appears like, but
then out of the water comes like

c3a52f90-470e-4b07-8a24-3129e245428d-2
01:11:58.257 --> 01:12:02.696
a scuba diver that has been
turned into a fish and they have

c3a52f90-470e-4b07-8a24-3129e245428d-3
01:12:02.696 --> 01:12:06.990
all of these tentacles that are
wrapped around their scuba

c3a52f90-470e-4b07-8a24-3129e245428d-4
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.119
diving equipment and it picks up
the boat.

7b23b152-cfa7-450f-855d-2ba2c92531cb-0
01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:13.720
There are two of them, actually.

11512bb4-2787-426e-99a4-ea0d4bf61a1e-0
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:21.250
And they come up towards a big
boat, these two giant.

1c36bdf1-b5c5-4561-ac44-7ad7f5b805d1-0
01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:26.987
Boats, and they're these big
metal ports. They have all of

1c36bdf1-b5c5-4561-ac44-7ad7f5b805d1-1
01:12:26.987 --> 01:12:31.648
these, the luggage of big sacks
or something. I don't know what

1c36bdf1-b5c5-4561-ac44-7ad7f5b805d1-2
01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:35.800
that is yet though, but they're
emitting a lot of smoke.

09771274-f10e-49a3-bdc1-81a585a193b6-0
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:37.260
Hmm.

a3938ece-aa29-4ecd-9c8b-743b8dc956a5-0
01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:43.014
And as he keeps going on, he
comes up to on oil rig. It looks

a3938ece-aa29-4ecd-9c8b-743b8dc956a5-1
01:12:43.014 --> 01:12:47.312
like in the middle of the ocean
there seems to be a whale

a3938ece-aa29-4ecd-9c8b-743b8dc956a5-2
01:12:47.312 --> 01:12:51.832
hanging off of it, off of the
oil rig and most of all around

a3938ece-aa29-4ecd-9c8b-743b8dc956a5-3
01:12:51.832 --> 01:12:56.204
as these birds that come just
crashing to the ground, they

a3938ece-aa29-4ecd-9c8b-743b8dc956a5-4
01:12:56.204 --> 01:12:59.909
look like they've all been
gotten smog poisoning.

37a248bc-c238-431c-95ec-33e698f6f5f1-0
01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:04.980
And.

b4fe5635-e34b-4e1a-b5e1-5e9d7e61d3ad-0
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:11.710
The boats or the oil rigs start
shooting at.

7c794d14-6924-4e61-915c-9e7b882f0567-0
01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.450
The.

d5fe0be1-6a56-49c1-8f0a-093f8a36cd4b-0
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:18.920
The little boat and actually
hits it and.

10935b56-ae22-4852-b509-c566e578debe-0
01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:22.460
Then there is also a person
that.

e4723b89-4523-42ef-88a0-9c8c53dd3a36-0
01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:25.360
It looks like a.

a311d59d-4096-44a4-9227-e1bbfed6fb4a-0
01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:31.062
Snorkeler, but they have like an
electric helmet and they have an

a311d59d-4096-44a4-9227-e1bbfed6fb4a-1
01:13:31.062 --> 01:13:32.380
electric bucket ship.

acec53e8-1fb4-4b1f-a93b-04fb93daed67-0
01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.730
And they go out to save the
wounded boat.

43eaaabf-778c-4949-96fe-f725c6143ac1-0
01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:44.670
wounded paper boat. and so the
wounded paper boat.

4245129a-4432-4a19-9b97-89a15a80e7ad-0
01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.756
Actually sailed by and I guess
that they've fallen into the

4245129a-4432-4a19-9b97-89a15a80e7ad-1
01:13:50.756 --> 01:13:55.064
water this snorkeler. They fall
into the water and the paper

4245129a-4432-4a19-9b97-89a15a80e7ad-2
01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.900
boat goes on and see this.

5330d3af-a9c5-4459-bc80-acd9fa1f868e-0
01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.101
Um seashell that is full of all
these scary there's a scary

5330d3af-a9c5-4459-bc80-acd9fa1f868e-1
01:14:03.101 --> 01:14:08.794
horse and the scary clown and
the deer with crazy antlers. And

5330d3af-a9c5-4459-bc80-acd9fa1f868e-2
01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:13.765
then at the top is the
originator of the boat with the

5330d3af-a9c5-4459-bc80-acd9fa1f868e-3
01:14:13.765 --> 01:14:17.470
Half Moon horn and the all black
attire.

90bc2011-c417-4136-a6f5-52ff2f05c5e9-0
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.121
And so the wave a huge wave
starts to take up the boat and

90bc2011-c417-4136-a6f5-52ff2f05c5e9-1
01:14:26.121 --> 01:14:31.894
our Half Moon king, he says that
that will not happen and so he

90bc2011-c417-4136-a6f5-52ff2f05c5e9-2
01:14:31.894 --> 01:14:34.510
takes he makes another paper.

9748745d-dff7-4e93-a26a-0c90454dc553-0
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:38.890
Airplane. And he goes and he he
starts. He looks like he's gonna

9748745d-dff7-4e93-a26a-0c90454dc553-1
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:40.130
throw it to save the boat.

ef792f3e-e49d-4d9c-8d88-e1ae9ad55082-0
01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:47.776
And the paper airplane comes
flying through the air as a

ef792f3e-e49d-4d9c-8d88-e1ae9ad55082-1
01:14:47.776 --> 01:14:51.637
storm approaches. Our little
paper boat that is still

ef792f3e-e49d-4d9c-8d88-e1ae9ad55082-2
01:14:51.637 --> 01:14:52.210
wounded.

3cf38d54-a8ee-4c89-903d-b3cf4696c9ef-0
01:14:56.930 --> 01:15:03.585
And ah, the air paper airplane
gets caught in a sea of sea

3cf38d54-a8ee-4c89-903d-b3cf4696c9ef-1
01:15:03.585 --> 01:15:09.000
snakes and our paper boat
continues to sail on.

382f56a5-3d17-464e-ae50-cb82eb248f01-0
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:14.652
he gets navigates through all of
these sea snakes, he's

382f56a5-3d17-464e-ae50-cb82eb248f01-1
01:15:14.652 --> 01:15:19.318
navigating through all of the
snakes, snakes all around, and

382f56a5-3d17-464e-ae50-cb82eb248f01-2
01:15:19.318 --> 01:15:21.230
the snake's watching him.

111b5bfd-252b-441e-993b-3dacd67703b2-0
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.620
Umm. And then as the book
continues to sail on, it looks

111b5bfd-252b-441e-993b-3dacd67703b2-1
01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:36.948
like it's starting to sink. We
pass from Narwhals that have

111b5bfd-252b-441e-993b-3dacd67703b2-2
01:15:36.948 --> 01:15:42.808
striped horns and some fish that
have some spiked noses, and then

111b5bfd-252b-441e-993b-3dacd67703b2-3
01:15:42.808 --> 01:15:48.668
we see a fish that's standing on
a deserted island with beer cans

111b5bfd-252b-441e-993b-3dacd67703b2-4
01:15:48.668 --> 01:15:52.220
and bottles of alcohol. And
you've got.

0467c430-10f8-4e3a-a1c4-45eb05fa8bfa-0
01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.915
striped or he's got polka dots
all over him. and he's wearing

0467c430-10f8-4e3a-a1c4-45eb05fa8bfa-1
01:15:56.915 --> 01:15:57.410
speedos.

d8c549cb-fa27-4048-8c90-127eb5c91435-0
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.411
And as the book goes on, he
comes up to all of these

d8c549cb-fa27-4048-8c90-127eb5c91435-1
01:16:04.411 --> 01:16:07.608
jellyfish and all of the
jellyfish. There's one jellyfish

d8c549cb-fa27-4048-8c90-127eb5c91435-2
01:16:07.608 --> 01:16:08.380
that has like.

d2b55bab-59d3-4461-a104-6b4904c5c8df-0
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:09.780
Um.

963d477d-2587-4f99-81f9-10cf3e8beed1-0
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:13.976
Right on. It's not really
stripes like circus type of

963d477d-2587-4f99-81f9-10cf3e8beed1-1
01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:14.320
stripe.

543cc914-3edb-4331-a510-3c6330615c41-0
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.452
And the boat gets caught in the
classes in a school of fish and

543cc914-3edb-4331-a510-3c6330615c41-1
01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:27.705
continues to float down and down
below the water and looks to be

543cc914-3edb-4331-a510-3c6330615c41-2
01:16:27.705 --> 01:16:32.796
sinking. And as it gets to the
bottom it starts getting fed on

543cc914-3edb-4331-a510-3c6330615c41-3
01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:34.090
by these little.

d1f9d063-0bdb-4ab6-9b8f-d286cb73d2a0-0
01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.420
I don't know what those are like
little fish.

be5bd27f-b2ce-4bb6-9507-cc9938d2ad51-0
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.587
Rat they have multiple different
legs and little arm and little

be5bd27f-b2ce-4bb6-9507-cc9938d2ad51-1
01:16:44.587 --> 01:16:47.480
tentacles, and they're eating
the boat.

9fba76fb-e462-4eef-887d-387568909d8f-0
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.040
And in the back you see a.

09065fe6-ee7a-470a-8b34-39bae968b576-0
01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:02.304
You see a submarine that is kind
of has also fallen to the bottom

09065fe6-ee7a-470a-8b34-39bae968b576-1
01:17:02.304 --> 01:17:03.570
of the ocean.

eb461072-a522-438f-b117-bc2789f314c0-0
01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:12.380
And the submarine ends up saving
our little boat.

41215029-c870-4a74-b74e-fa60d9e934d1-0
01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.660
The little Paper boat and brings
it to an octopus vote.

81495b62-d1e1-481f-9882-3bf720d3656a-0
01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.630
There's a boat with an octopus.

376ac2c8-01e8-4939-8794-eb2938cd15ee-0
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:27.148
And the boat gets tossed along
by sea lions as they're all

376ac2c8-01e8-4939-8794-eb2938cd15ee-1
01:17:27.148 --> 01:17:31.378
playing in the water, they're
playing it with the mouth and

376ac2c8-01e8-4939-8794-eb2938cd15ee-2
01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:35.960
then it looks like it's going to
go towards a underwater jungle.

cffbddb7-f549-42ee-9c3d-e5edf69a378b-0
01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:46.155
And the underwater jungle, it's
just kind of bopping along and

cffbddb7-f549-42ee-9c3d-e5edf69a378b-1
01:17:46.155 --> 01:17:48.160
being pushed by the.

40c6c9d3-b25f-4bed-b7aa-dd99fcfdc58c-0
01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:54.838
ferns up the water and at the
bottom below them is a scuba

40c6c9d3-b25f-4bed-b7aa-dd99fcfdc58c-1
01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:59.817
diver that is stealing a Pearl
from an oyster that they've

40c6c9d3-b25f-4bed-b7aa-dd99fcfdc58c-2
01:17:59.817 --> 01:18:00.830
forced open.

45ebd88c-39eb-42ba-be91-8dfbe2de9fd5-0
01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:10.946
The boat sailed past a several
different types of starfish

45ebd88c-39eb-42ba-be91-8dfbe2de9fd5-1
01:18:10.946 --> 01:18:16.328
people that have been taken that
are have taken shelter on a

45ebd88c-39eb-42ba-be91-8dfbe2de9fd5-2
01:18:16.328 --> 01:18:16.770
buoy.

a91c35d9-cdf3-46d7-9cf0-d4b7f2b14f16-0
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.600
And it starts sailing towards
the lighthouse.

659f6e8b-8939-48af-bb9e-6d5b0b9f7046-0
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.461
And once it gets to the
lighthouse, where do we pass the

659f6e8b-8939-48af-bb9e-6d5b0b9f7046-1
01:18:27.461 --> 01:18:30.130
White House? This is a dock of
some sort.

2be04386-2a49-4aad-884e-6d06b6720b41-0
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.370
Yeah, so get it going past the
dock now.

0b41c35b-f4a9-4fe3-8531-58d6cc5dfef9-0
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.669
And then as it goes past the
dock, it comes up to several

0b41c35b-f4a9-4fe3-8531-58d6cc5dfef9-1
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:43.700
different types of boats.

42d7b29f-35bf-436d-81b6-ce3a206c8219-0
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:51.852
And and then once they go past
the boat, everybody is looking

42d7b29f-35bf-436d-81b6-ce3a206c8219-1
01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:52.430
at this.

513295e6-7497-4646-951d-b54636c395a5-0
01:18:53.820 --> 01:19:00.290
Giant whale that is taking a
shower with an oxygen tank.

68692b76-ae94-45f4-a06c-271ec87db241-0
01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:15.926
And then the book keeps going on
until it gets to a port, and the

68692b76-ae94-45f4-a06c-271ec87db241-1
01:19:15.926 --> 01:19:19.340
port has a pattern that.

401d5e42-51a4-4b69-862e-bc4da4b55ebc-0
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:29.120
what are those called? a pattern
fish design of.

c5340bc8-29b0-432c-83a0-ed6d2c75416c-0
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:34.903
what is this called? Yeah,
anyway, and they've caught the

c5340bc8-29b0-432c-83a0-ed6d2c75416c-1
01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:39.668
narwhal, yeah ohh they're
catching the narwhal and all the

c5340bc8-29b0-432c-83a0-ed6d2c75416c-2
01:19:39.668 --> 01:19:44.110
animals and the boat is just
watching it all happened.

1f37922c-cd07-484a-b178-20a2f12a374a-0
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:53.404
And now it's night time in this
area and we see our fish with

1f37922c-cd07-484a-b178-20a2f12a374a-1
01:19:53.404 --> 01:19:55.780

0ff74c9d-6359-4da4-8b12-ee3a894ea844-0
01:19:57.150 --> 01:20:01.860
Um, the striped Speedo that is
now flying through the air.

12ec574f-8de4-49ca-8ea7-edbf18cf6628-0
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:07.570
It's a flying fish.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.530
And then and here.

5274aa57-6c2d-454e-913c-4ec1cbd5b7c5-0
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.610
And then when it gets to.

6cb650f7-ebb2-469f-abae-06002eb8ecf2-0
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:19.924
Umm, the base of this little
underground like cavern you see

6cb650f7-ebb2-469f-abae-06002eb8ecf2-1
01:20:19.924 --> 01:20:25.428
several different types of you
see the Half Moon horn guy and

6cb650f7-ebb2-469f-abae-06002eb8ecf2-2
01:20:25.428 --> 01:20:31.198
the deer with the antlers, with
the crackled antlers, and all of

6cb650f7-ebb2-469f-abae-06002eb8ecf2-3
01:20:31.198 --> 01:20:36.436
the other all of the other
friends that they made on their

6cb650f7-ebb2-469f-abae-06002eb8ecf2-4
01:20:36.436 --> 01:20:36.880
boat.

107d2275-8c28-4081-80fd-35b3a992cc0b-0
01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:45.373
And then he keeps on going and
keeps on passing through this

107d2275-8c28-4081-80fd-35b3a992cc0b-1
01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:46.630
underground tunnel.

a43e9a93-ee14-405f-b0a1-7d9ce1245f9c-0
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:55.571
And then he comes up to a lone
house and he finally docks and

a43e9a93-ee14-405f-b0a1-7d9ce1245f9c-1
01:20:55.571 --> 01:21:00.196
we see that there is a person
that gets out. The person gets

a43e9a93-ee14-405f-b0a1-7d9ce1245f9c-2
01:21:00.196 --> 01:21:04.898
out of the boat and the boat
disappears and he starts walking

a43e9a93-ee14-405f-b0a1-7d9ce1245f9c-3
01:21:04.898 --> 01:21:05.959
up the stairs.

a674acb9-6426-492c-95f0-1c287037d712-0
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:12.093
And he looks to be a combination
of the black One man and the

a674acb9-6426-492c-95f0-1c287037d712-1
01:21:12.093 --> 01:21:16.568
striped person that built him.
