00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.069
Imagine you're describing the
scene to somebody who cannot see

6d8dbdb8-f42e-42e4-9363-15b88b5ceaa9-1
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.973

happening and what you see as

thoroughly as possible. And
please take between three and

{OK, Are you ready? Yeah. OK.
There's a square here in front

it's OK to record. So OK. So it

00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:48.775
says guarded early meetings. So
I just hit, got it, yes, got it.

6f478650-ef5e-4ae3-b2ce-1dcc0b6054af-2

{OK, all right. All right. So
here's the first complex scene,

c6df8d2e-3494-4322-bd02-015ce88e45eb-1
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:59.650
and you can start talking about
it when you're ready. Ohh wow.}

2fab6344-ab6e-4b5d-b2d3-b1cc19ab6b88-0
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.780
#START_unfriendly_giants It's a
scene with.

d3ca4a75-3d5f-41dd-bb24-7c0a429e2b0d-0
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.460
Wizards and Waldo that looks
like almost giants.

c74bd70b-7099-416b-ab03-97873a470696-0
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.360
And.

74432c72-2cce-4ede-9adf-c0962b99bb30-0

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.930
There's one hiding behind a
tree. Several.

2db4eb63-c9b8-4baa-bd95-7d597fbcd90b-0
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.375
Being like attacking a castle at
the top. There's one near a

2db4eb63-c9b8-4baa-bd95-7d597fbcd90b-1
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:32.790
windmill. There's several
windmills up in the top right.

7b72f82f-5b45-4a00-97fa-23f64e2192cc-0
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.670
Umm.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.450
I'm not sure what that is, some
kind of oil rig down below and

9baac445-abf9-4710-841a-47985146ec46-1
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.980
then there's one on the middle
right

aae7c2c2-e10f-4478-b74f-07ae9a3ced57-0
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.660

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.742
I guess or giants or Wizards
giving somebody a flowers, but

53df3383-fd7f-45bc-871e-f9bd8612a252-1
00:01:53.742 --> 00:01:55.410
it looks like it's a.

8fe270c7-5929-460f-82f7-594aa3e1e880-0
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980
cardboard

cfc6334f-ef15-4fc3-90a5-1169bcf73611-0
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.782
And then, going over towards the
middle, there's one giant

cfc6334f-ef15-4fc3-90a5-1169bcf73611-1
00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:12.880
kneeling down and tipping his
hat to the little people below.

e7342e86-02a4-4a46-9f03-7c771cb05972-0
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.941
And then there's it right in the
middle. There's some little

e7342e86-02a4-4a46-9f03-7c771cb05972-1
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:21.312
people in the house standing
around a house and somewhere on

e7342e86-02a4-4a46-9f03-7c771cb05972-2
00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:21.810
the roof.

074a6ee0-7007-4e12-b0ab-05794dd9f1b2-0
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.820
And there's another giant with a
rope, and he's gonna try to.

9afd7fc3-64c0-4b91-bbd8-52486f4b1a97-0
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.957
Looks like he's trying to
capture them or something. And

9afd7fc3-64c0-4b91-bbd8-52486f4b1a97-1
00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:36.660
then there's another guy that
has some people in his belt.

37540cae-ec4f-406d-b13b-04ef07df3a3b-0
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.010
And then in the middle and the
far left.

6afbd2c1-e3ef-48d4-b6f7-60e793cd03de-0
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.300
There's another giant with
another woman standing standing.

67864e90-36e9-42ba-bd4a-97e502a8224a-0
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.185
On the very bottom on the left,
there's another house with some

67864e90-36e9-42ba-bd4a-97e502a8224a-1
00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:54.250
little people.

1de9485b-c330-40b6-8347-be41cfed38df-0
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.350
And then?

a00eacc0-78a5-4647-9f46-56f6fa6af6da-0
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.970
Going towards the middle bottom,
there's 123456 giants playing.

c763895a-f4f3-4af0-a119-f7f345dcb02b-0
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.200
Chess with the little people and
using them as the chess pieces.

3f21aa1c-1caf-4687-9850-28ea713f5314-0
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.912
Then there is going towards the
right on the bottom another

3f21aa1c-1caf-4687-9850-28ea713f5314-1
00:03:19.912 --> 00:03:23.140
little people house with some
catapults.

9f288351-5557-49cf-84a6-b1750bf31cbe-0
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.670
And then on the far bottom
right, there's.

61827b5f-7a26-4902-a41a-62d9ca194606-0
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.092
Four more giants with straws.
Oh, they're sipping the water

61827b5f-7a26-4902-a41a-62d9ca194606-1
00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:37.924
out of the puddles or the lake
and spitting the water out of

61827b5f-7a26-4902-a41a-62d9ca194606-2
00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:39.350
the little people.

fb93242d-feb9-4fe3-9890-e59b543307f3-0
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.100
From.

be8233fb-9ce7-4cd3-a42d-4a19210b2d28-0
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210
At the top left.

719f47a3-a560-4c0b-b3fa-ccd95cc79c8c-0
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.015
There is a Waldo and wizard
White Beard came to the land of

719f47a3-a560-4c0b-b3fa-ccd95cc79c8c-1
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:52.740
unfriendly giants where many
waters have been before. Waldo

719f47a3-a560-4c0b-b3fa-ccd95cc79c8c-2
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.154
saw that the Giants were
horribly harassing the little

719f47a3-a560-4c0b-b3fa-ccd95cc79c8c-3
00:03:56.154 --> 00:03:59.755
people, and when he found the
10th school, it was time to

719f47a3-a560-4c0b-b3fa-ccd95cc79c8c-4
00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:01.369
continue with his journey.

f7d8aa8a-b2b2-45f4-9b76-807b9a82112b-0
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.230


3a39ae2e-2d1c-4f82-85c2-3c28e61c015c-0
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.530
So yes, there's it's all giants
and little people.

2577f090-9108-4530-9597-0571555b9a0b-0
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.790
Umm.

674784fe-f12a-416f-867e-7097dbee00cd-0
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.000
Let's see what else is there.

45dce5b6-14c0-4279-b17b-5077a40952df-0
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.660
Oh, I don't know if those.

203252a7-f313-44cf-8482-79e3b1d05ecd-0
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.097
Or oil rigs or some kind of
catapults, I guess there's some

203252a7-f313-44cf-8482-79e3b1d05ecd-1
00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:26.700
kind of catapults wooden

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.020
With wooden logs on top of them.

fcc7f2c3-acea-4fa9-ad80-875d7b4148e0-0
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.654
#END_unfriendly_giants And on
both the top right and the top

fcc7f2c3-acea-4fa9-ad80-875d7b4148e0-1
00:04:34.654 --> 00:04:37.600
left there's windmills. There's
two windmills on each side.

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-0
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.778
{OK, you're good on time, OK?
And sometimes you see those

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-1
00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:48.168
descriptions. You can read them
to yourself, kind of get an idea

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-2
00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:52.492
what the pictures is about, but
you don't have to read them out

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-3
00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:56.545
loud. OK, good. OK, moving on.
This next one is a different

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-4
00:04:56.545 --> 00:05:00.530
type of pictures. And they're
they're instead of one page,

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-5
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.719
they're multiple pages, so they
usually tell a story. Imagine

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-6
00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.434
you're telling the story to
someone who cannot see the

85d2603c-4b1b-44d0-87eb-10ebfb137bbb-7
00:05:08.434 --> 00:05:09.110
pictures.}

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.613
{Again, describe what you see
and what is happening as you go

5d5d97bb-99fb-49a5-8139-3bce93b32630-1

through the story.}

has around 5 pages.}

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.049
left, there's a photo in a frame
of it looks like a family, a

dbfc56f9-6390-43f6-8dbe-51ba0db54a00-2
00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.850
mother, father and a little girl
daughter.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.000
In the second photo somebody is
is picking up.

dab51fa7-f30a-4a57-b44d-2bcd430c9a0b-0
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.360
The pitcher.

cedb7813-6d5d-4b88-b093-95e820e27028-0
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.446
In the third photo, they're
wrapping the picture kind of

cedb7813-6d5d-4b88-b093-95e820e27028-1
00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:59.148
wrap, wrapping paper or wrapping
cloth, and then they're tying a

cedb7813-6d5d-4b88-b093-95e820e27028-2
00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:04.200
string around the package and
tying a bow in it.

dfe6441c-64ad-4db6-9404-ca5c7fbbd5b7-0
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.640
In the middle one.

3be9d9c3-02d9-4d66-aa61-b474bf969d92-0
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.602
It's hard to tell what he's
doing. I guess he's taking the

3be9d9c3-02d9-4d66-aa61-b474bf969d92-1
00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:15.010
package somewhere.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.032
And it looks like, ohh, it's a
suitcase, it looks, it puts it

67ab7b20-bec7-4b50-91f8-f9976c172e69-1
00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:26.709
in it looks like he put it
inside the suitcase. I see there

67ab7b20-bec7-4b50-91f8-f9976c172e69-2
00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:31.541
was it's a suitcase with looks
like a newspaper inside of it.

67ab7b20-bec7-4b50-91f8-f9976c172e69-3
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:35.984
And he puts it inside the
suitcase and then he puts some

67ab7b20-bec7-4b50-91f8-f9976c172e69-4
00:06:35.984 --> 00:06:40.349
kind of buckle around the
suitcase and puts his hand on

67ab7b20-bec7-4b50-91f8-f9976c172e69-5
00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.830

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.040
There's and he puts both of his
hands on top of it.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.860
Oh, OK.

5bf0a371-875c-40f3-ba59-e8210ac1a0dc-0
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.360
Hmm. There's a large picture on
the right. It's.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.080
A man and a woman.

1f99ff12-07a7-4ab3-9ff0-328366c518bf-0
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.770
Then they look sad and there's
they have cups of tea and there

1f99ff12-07a7-4ab3-9ff0-328366c518bf-1
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.910
they have their hands on top of
the suitcase.

4be464b1-0cb4-4f9b-ae32-f6a2169cee11-0
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.510
That he put the photo in, that
he put the picture in.

0b4d3a7c-029f-406c-8d13-1599a6743b2a-0
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.325
To the left there's small
pictures. It looks like a

0b4d3a7c-029f-406c-8d13-1599a6743b2a-1
00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:26.680
origami bird, a clock.

4c22dae0-7716-4fec-affd-f96700df97c7-0
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.760
Some hooks on the wall with a
hat and some kind of.

9875882a-0793-469a-a688-ee9ad02a571b-0
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.050
Clothing or kerchief or scarf.
And then there's a photo of.

e024fdb6-7622-4d0b-9957-87bf498f87c1-0
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.642
A pot with a lid and a spoon. It
looks like a wooden spoon. And

e024fdb6-7622-4d0b-9957-87bf498f87c1-1
00:07:45.642 --> 00:07:50.937
there is a photo, a drawing that
looks like a child drew it like

e024fdb6-7622-4d0b-9957-87bf498f87c1-2
00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:55.987
a man, woman and A and a child.
And a man's has a bird on his

e024fdb6-7622-4d0b-9957-87bf498f87c1-3
00:07:55.987 --> 00:08:00.060
arm and a sun and clouds and
they all look happy.

a90d8f28-3855-49ac-be1a-ca34e722382d-0
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.175
The teapot looks like it's hot
steams coming out of it and it's

a90d8f28-3855-49ac-be1a-ca34e722382d-1
00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:05.380
there's crap in it.

236a2ef3-d009-49e8-ac16-0826c7cebcbf-0
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.717
The next picture is a cup, and
the cup also has a crack on a

236a2ef3-d009-49e8-ac16-0826c7cebcbf-1
00:08:11.717 --> 00:08:16.545
saucer. And then there's some
photos or maybe postcards. One

236a2ef3-d009-49e8-ac16-0826c7cebcbf-2
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:21.451
of them has a ship on it, this
top one, and can't really tell

236a2ef3-d009-49e8-ac16-0826c7cebcbf-3
00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:26.279
what the other ones are. The
next one is the suitcase opened

236a2ef3-d009-49e8-ac16-0826c7cebcbf-4
00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.869
with some clothes in it. And
then the last picture is the

236a2ef3-d009-49e8-ac16-0826c7cebcbf-5
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:33.559
man, woman and little girl
again.

ba5e6902-d64d-4c9c-8aeb-2c516488bd82-0
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.920
Oh, and everything is on is on
the top, is on the big picture

ba5e6902-d64d-4c9c-8aeb-2c516488bd82-1

b1b031c4-6892-479d-90dd-905792c2f76f-0
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.430
OK.

b759aaba-9552-4a45-ab40-6c1956fa9007-0
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:49.044
OK, now the big picture again is
the man woman in little girl

b759aaba-9552-4a45-ab40-6c1956fa9007-1
00:08:49.044 --> 00:08:54.194
with the suitcase and they're
walking down the street. Looks

b759aaba-9552-4a45-ab40-6c1956fa9007-2
00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:59.512
like an Old Street and almost
looks like a dragon shadow going

b759aaba-9552-4a45-ab40-6c1956fa9007-3
00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:02.130
across the wall, a dragon tail.

6a9fc26d-4434-4efc-ac49-2d541ce4ee07-0
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.138
The middle photos is a girl
laying with her head down on,

6a9fc26d-4434-4efc-ac49-2d541ce4ee07-1
00:09:09.138 --> 00:09:14.069
laying with her head down and
with covers, blankets over her

6a9fc26d-4434-4efc-ac49-2d541ce4ee07-2
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:19.081
and her face is hidden. Then
she's looks like she's waking up

6a9fc26d-4434-4efc-ac49-2d541ce4ee07-3
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:23.931
and kind of peeking over the
blanket and she looks like she

6a9fc26d-4434-4efc-ac49-2d541ce4ee07-4
00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:29.104
sits up and she's yawning, wakes
up and then she's sitting at a

6a9fc26d-4434-4efc-ac49-2d541ce4ee07-5
00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:29.590
table.

f571caee-ee0a-43c9-8fce-383b4059ccef-0
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.402
And eating something out of a
bowl with a spoon. And then she

f571caee-ee0a-43c9-8fce-383b4059ccef-1
00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:38.010

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.896
To her left while she's eating
and then there's a photo of the

a1f6d23c-b62e-4835-b93b-c5fecb9650af-1
00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:44.640
suitcase.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.510
The next one is the photo of the
man and he's putting the hat on,

9bc9615a-b872-4e04-b49b-c91253b6c799-1
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.170
and then a photo of the woman
and she's putting the scarf on

9bc9615a-b872-4e04-b49b-c91253b6c799-2
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.710
her head.

5a814b94-73ca-4f51-9572-89e55192713d-0
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.776
In in the photo of the little
girl and she's putting a hat on

5a814b94-73ca-4f51-9572-89e55192713d-1
00:10:00.776 --> 00:10:06.254
like a winter hat and somebody's
helping her with her buttoning

5a814b94-73ca-4f51-9572-89e55192713d-2
00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:11.560
her coat up front. Then she puts
on some boots, galoshes type

5a814b94-73ca-4f51-9572-89e55192713d-3
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.695
boots, rain boots and she's
giving up trying to pick up the

5a814b94-73ca-4f51-9572-89e55192713d-4
00:10:16.695 --> 00:10:22.173
suitcase or holding the suitcase
and she has all the the winter

00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:25.339
coat and hat on and then the man
is.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.311
It looks like he's reaching for
her or reaching for the

2d0399d6-2004-4a55-a24e-52a43adc0951-1
00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:32.500
suitcase. Maybe take the
suitcase off of her.

61b8a7aa-a933-46ef-900f-4d5a68c20604-0
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.450
OK.

24c99da6-7e38-4829-8021-26dc2f8e39e5-0
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.963
The big photo has a train in it
and there's a lot of people with

24c99da6-7e38-4829-8021-26dc2f8e39e5-1
00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:44.640
luggage.

edaf94b8-5057-46df-95d8-4256a15df0a7-0
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.210
Waiting. It looks like waiting
for the train.

e2a073e8-8cc4-4218-9525-f191eb4f606d-0
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.276
And then there's smaller
pictures around it. The picture

e2a073e8-8cc4-4218-9525-f191eb4f606d-1
00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:57.577

she has the winter hat on and
she is looking up and she looks

sad and she looks down and she
looks sad. All the she looks

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:11.147
sad. And she was looking kind of
straight ahead and somebody

e2a073e8-8cc4-4218-9525-f191eb4f606d-5
00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:16.041
still holding her hand. And then
somebody puts her his their hand

e2a073e8-8cc4-4218-9525-f191eb4f606d-6
00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.230
looks like the man's hand on her
shoulder.

c4c859ff-2879-476a-8f36-e04a608fae7b-0
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:26.006
And he lifts his hat up ohh he
lifts his hat up in the origami

c4c859ff-2879-476a-8f36-e04a608fae7b-1
00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:31.882

he hugs her and she's holding

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:49.510
the origami bird and she looks
up and the what the woman is.

01d83f42-1a5d-4269-aebd-4a58e42ea42c-0
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.460
Crying and.

da595b36-2ee1-4bf0-bd33-7bd0193df0ae-0
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.847
Wiping her eyes with a
handkerchief and then the woman

da595b36-2ee1-4bf0-bd33-7bd0193df0ae-1
00:11:57.847 --> 00:12:02.323
in the man or hugging, and he
seems to be whispering something

da595b36-2ee1-4bf0-bd33-7bd0193df0ae-2
00:12:02.323 --> 00:12:06.942
to her and the woman looks very
upset. And then the man with the

da595b36-2ee1-4bf0-bd33-7bd0193df0ae-3

stepping up on the train. And
then there's three hands and it

holding hands together.

5b230cbf-ded1-4026-be1f-80074d9472d5-0
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.540
Then.

7e6ff932-b2a6-4e0d-af72-b3c1e3763f45-0
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.923
It looks like the man's hand is
leaving and the woman and

7e6ff932-b2a6-4e0d-af72-b3c1e3763f45-1
00:12:26.923 --> 00:12:29.670

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.703
With the smoke leaving and then
it looks like it's going farther

458ca3dd-34de-41e2-b12a-3ae8b4933bf4-1
00:12:38.703 --> 00:12:41.770
away and then it's disappearing
off into the distance.

50b1b551-d55d-48f9-bd2d-d4afeb6f31df-0
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:51.335

three people in the photo, and
then it starts getting farther

08e8c2a4-9aa2-45ab-9514-199c1649e313-2
00:13:14.403 --> 00:13:19.435
away. Oh, it's a it's a porthole
from a ship. And then it gets

08e8c2a4-9aa2-45ab-9514-199c1649e313-3
00:13:19.435 --> 00:13:24.466
even smaller, like he's getting
farther away. And then there's

08e8c2a4-9aa2-45ab-9514-199c1649e313-4
00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:29.179

00:13:38.968 --> 00:13:43.561
side of the ship and you can see
the three smokestacks, and then

35060bd5-f95d-4d34-a5a9-a0c68d890a10-2
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:47.870
there's a full photo of the
ship. {OK, so that was this part

35060bd5-f95d-4d34-a5a9-a0c68d890a10-3
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.859
of the story.}

4020e949-0a8b-4734-978f-901ea0f33efd-0
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.730
{So the next story has around 20
pages.

3fc64574-3a30-4c99-88c6-1eb1efa5b705-0
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.200
Wow.

624fa6be-2aad-4bf8-bb9c-eceb8621bc3f-0
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.140
Sounds like a mission.

7c31fad7-eded-4456-90fc-8bb552de19e4-0
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.200
OK.}

efe35ccc-fd97-4c3d-893c-78934d69f93c-0
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:10.972
#START_journey The photo of it
looks like a some type of city

efe35ccc-fd97-4c3d-893c-78934d69f93c-1
00:14:10.972 --> 00:14:14.900
block with some children playing
on.

831a5645-edc7-47b0-9ec6-e804a10df99e-0
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.918
Bicycles and skateboards.
There's a mailbox and there's

831a5645-edc7-47b0-9ec6-e804a10df99e-1
00:14:20.918 --> 00:14:25.722
some street lights and a
stoplight, red light and a fire

831a5645-edc7-47b0-9ec6-e804a10df99e-2
00:14:25.722 --> 00:14:30.946
hydrant. And then it kind of
shows like underneath the street

831a5645-edc7-47b0-9ec6-e804a10df99e-3
00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:35.750
and there's some pipes, storage,
storage or water pipes.

3d711e99-4383-40df-a15b-b7aaf32f027a-0
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:43.355
And then the next picture is a
little girl sitting on the steps

3d711e99-4383-40df-a15b-b7aaf32f027a-1
00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:50.015
with a scooter. You can still
see the water pipes under the or

3d711e99-4383-40df-a15b-b7aaf32f027a-2
00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:52.130
under the street and

7f744903-c99e-4202-925a-92a61c30ba09-0
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.582
Inside the house, there's a man
sitting on the computer with

7f744903-c99e-4202-925a-92a61c30ba09-1
00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:04.297
books on shelves. The next room
there is, it looks like a little

7f744903-c99e-4202-925a-92a61c30ba09-2
00:15:04.297 --> 00:15:09.660
girl or a girl woman girl and
she's looking at something. Or

7f744903-c99e-4202-925a-92a61c30ba09-3
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.770
she's sitting on a sofa.

c24844db-e648-4c5c-9455-fbf71f198ab4-0
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.861
The next picture on the 1st
floor looks like a hallway with

c24844db-e648-4c5c-9455-fbf71f198ab4-1
00:15:19.861 --> 00:15:23.330
stairs going up and there's a
lamp.

0051da45-1bd2-4424-b083-6b95628f05e1-0
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.795
In a vase and photos on the
walls and the mirror and the

0051da45-1bd2-4424-b083-6b95628f05e1-1
00:15:27.795 --> 00:15:32.046
folks with coats and hats on it,
and then the other room on the

0051da45-1bd2-4424-b083-6b95628f05e1-2
00:15:32.046 --> 00:15:33.840
1st floor, there's a woman.

a956eda3-3f11-40ae-8716-afd2e71c77b7-0
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.139
Cooking something on the stove
in a in a pan and she's

a956eda3-3f11-40ae-8716-afd2e71c77b7-1
00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:42.250
stirring, stirring something on
the stove.

4a5577d2-dbf1-4837-819e-0636f0acecdc-0
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.130
OK.

aa2bce91-0933-4712-bd16-c6b7c3a787e3-0
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:52.398
The next photo there's a woman.
The woman is on the telephone

aa2bce91-0933-4712-bd16-c6b7c3a787e3-1
00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:56.271
and she's still cooking
something on the stove and

aa2bce91-0933-4712-bd16-c6b7c3a787e3-2
00:15:56.271 --> 00:16:00.979
stirring, and the little girl
has her red scooter and she is.

9921dd3b-5dd0-4a89-978a-e950cb2031a7-0
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.560
Looking at something in the
kitchen.

69679711-3369-4de1-b612-000b5af97f86-0
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.370
On the kitchen counter or sink.
Then the little girl has a red

69679711-3369-4de1-b612-000b5af97f86-1
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:16.680
kite and she's looking at the
man on the computer standing

69679711-3369-4de1-b612-000b5af97f86-2
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.080
behind him, behind him on the
chair. Then she is looking, I

69679711-3369-4de1-b612-000b5af97f86-3
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.750
guess the older, she's looking
at the older girl that's on the

69679711-3369-4de1-b612-000b5af97f86-4
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.290
couch.

76b035d6-7aa1-43d7-b8b6-2ab0fc7209ba-0
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.759
Looks like she has a camera. She
has also had something red in

76b035d6-7aa1-43d7-b8b6-2ab0fc7209ba-1
00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:35.890
her hand. Red.

077f0232-276a-4c3b-ae52-1f0f73d81fe4-0
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:44.312
Circle or a ball. And then she
goes and she's into a room, a

077f0232-276a-4c3b-ae52-1f0f73d81fe4-1
00:16:44.312 --> 00:16:49.090
bedroom with a bed. She sitting
on the bed.

c2e8f496-2d84-46a4-b863-f9358848e079-0
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.075
And she looks sad or lonely. The
door is open and there's a cat

c2e8f496-2d84-46a4-b863-f9358848e079-1
00:16:55.075 --> 00:16:57.520
sitting on the floor, sleeping.

a43b20d4-d289-4a80-97d2-3520a8a94e38-0
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.223
The next one the cat leaves goes
out the door and there's

a43b20d4-d289-4a80-97d2-3520a8a94e38-1
00:17:06.223 --> 00:17:10.256
something red on the floor.
There's a bunch of pieces of

a43b20d4-d289-4a80-97d2-3520a8a94e38-2
00:17:10.256 --> 00:17:14.713
paper and there's something red
on the floor and the girl gets

a43b20d4-d289-4a80-97d2-3520a8a94e38-3
00:17:14.713 --> 00:17:18.675
sits up off on the bed and is
looking at the papers and

a43b20d4-d289-4a80-97d2-3520a8a94e38-4
00:17:18.675 --> 00:17:21.930
whatever that is that's red, she
picks it up.

6e75417e-d437-4790-884a-a35d4098c33f-0
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.771
Ohh some kind of pen or crayon.
She picks it up and starts

6e75417e-d437-4790-884a-a35d4098c33f-1
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:34.132
drawing it looks like on the
wall from the floor baseboard

6e75417e-d437-4790-884a-a35d4098c33f-2
00:17:34.132 --> 00:17:39.493
all the way up on top of the
wall and she draws a red door

6e75417e-d437-4790-884a-a35d4098c33f-3
00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:42.219
and she goes through the door.

be9c8c9a-146a-4241-b993-ececd0053caf-0
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.510
OK.

23c21cf7-584b-4cd4-a19a-f7064999e21c-0
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:52.080
Ohh my. She goes through the
door and she's in.

acd2f3cf-42f2-4c72-810c-c71eb120b816-0
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.730
some kind of forest or woods and
green forest, and there's a.

2eb44899-2105-4f8d-8332-264cd421ba92-0
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:04.195
A stream going through, and
there's lights and lanterns and

2eb44899-2105-4f8d-8332-264cd421ba92-1
00:18:04.195 --> 00:18:08.760
strings of lights and lanterns
strung between the trees.

bf223894-b349-4911-bb30-1be06c240d78-0
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.440
Um, she goes.

ac9e2f76-fb36-4cec-9397-518f6d5ec3f3-0
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.298
onto dock to the stream and she
looks down and she's still

ac9e2f76-fb36-4cec-9397-518f6d5ec3f3-1
00:18:22.298 --> 00:18:26.484
holding the red marker or
crayon, whatever it is, and she

ac9e2f76-fb36-4cec-9397-518f6d5ec3f3-2
00:18:26.484 --> 00:18:29.010
sees her reflection in the
string.

25b2b792-e8e3-44a1-bd82-222e75484634-0
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.377
And she leans down over the dock
and she starts drawing with the

25b2b792-e8e3-44a1-bd82-222e75484634-1
00:18:36.377 --> 00:18:41.585
red crayon in the stream and she
draws a boat, red boat, and she

25b2b792-e8e3-44a1-bd82-222e75484634-2
00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:44.549
gets into the boat, into the
stream.

fc53f912-af70-4055-8238-94270bae14ea-0
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.785
Ohh my she this is pretty she
she takes the red boat down and

fc53f912-af70-4055-8238-94270bae14ea-1
00:18:54.785 --> 00:19:01.500
it looks like almost a castle
type city. Fortress Type city.

7ad669c1-1a69-478e-8469-d1d0ac7ea6bb-0
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.980
To a moat type.

916902f1-3c2c-41c7-9be8-1eaaf529e24e-0
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.896
Area with gold in the castle has
flags and gold drums on the top,

916902f1-3c2c-41c7-9be8-1eaaf529e24e-1
00:19:13.896 --> 00:19:16.230
and there's more boats.

52c3bfbd-edfa-4571-a007-86b51c71a8b8-0
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.090
And people in boats.

b95dfc2f-c500-430a-9508-b1ed0565f114-0
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:31.537
Um, she's still her boat and
there's several men in yellow

b95dfc2f-c500-430a-9508-b1ed0565f114-1
00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:37.833
greenish uniforms. They look
like either military or

b95dfc2f-c500-430a-9508-b1ed0565f114-2
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:45.316
security, and they're all waving
at her as she's floating down

b95dfc2f-c500-430a-9508-b1ed0565f114-3
00:19:45.316 --> 00:19:45.910
this.

af307112-349a-4f7a-8771-dc4df0db80be-0
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.635
Stream, it looks like water
going all through the city in

af307112-349a-4f7a-8771-dc4df0db80be-1
00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:57.661
different levels and then
there's other people in boats

af307112-349a-4f7a-8771-dc4df0db80be-2
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.110
like.

9d159db7-3392-4b4e-93f0-59c4c0a08093-0
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:05.814
Gondola type boats. There's a
waterfall going through. Yeah.

9d159db7-3392-4b4e-93f0-59c4c0a08093-1
00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:07.770
Oh, OK and then she.

3b3f35f4-d0eb-4dd3-a258-f52fe871b236-0
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.290
Still on the boat and she's.

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-0
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.717
At the edge of the top of the
waterfall, about to fall off and

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-1
00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:22.085
the guards are look like they're
yelling or warning her and

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-2
00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:25.944
waving. And then there's
different levels with other

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-3
00:20:25.944 --> 00:20:30.531
people on the gondolas. So she
gets her crayon apparently. Oh,

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-4
00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:34.609
she starts to fall. I guess
falls off the waterfall and

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-5
00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:38.905
she's drawing something while
she's falling. It looks like

2f34b089-ba62-4890-9d83-81e69e9d4eac-6
00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:42.400
some type of circle have about
2/3 of a circle.

f81451b5-5984-434f-946c-ffae3327d1bd-0
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.490
It's.

7a9b9e57-2238-4f59-aa61-f7fcee8fd074-0
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.670
She.

f1746178-ba6a-450d-9182-55bcfc6aee9f-0
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:53.323
Apparently has drawn a hot air
balloon and she gets inside the

f1746178-ba6a-450d-9182-55bcfc6aee9f-1
00:20:53.323 --> 00:20:55.450
hot air balloon basket.

ce7afecf-3f94-4589-bc06-3378075b2377-0
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.887
And it's, which is red also,
because you do it in red and

ce7afecf-3f94-4589-bc06-3378075b2377-1
00:20:59.887 --> 00:21:00.730
she's waving.

64e6c271-afbd-4647-8a8b-393b0a4aaea9-0
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.000
To the guards and floating up in
the air.

3386c437-9ea3-4efb-87c5-9cc3b899965f-0
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:12.770
The next picture is a photo of
clouds in a blimp type.

95cb2f4d-8252-4f58-aac0-161b49b4c40e-0
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.338
Vehicle in some other kind of
vehicle, oh there's 2 blimp type

95cb2f4d-8252-4f58-aac0-161b49b4c40e-1
00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.481
vehicles and another vehicle
with steam coming out of it and

95cb2f4d-8252-4f58-aac0-161b49b4c40e-2
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:26.624
it looks like they're up in the
clouds. There's some kind of

95cb2f4d-8252-4f58-aac0-161b49b4c40e-3
00:21:26.624 --> 00:21:28.730
purple bird, looks like a bird.

71e4e9c4-d8dd-4458-9944-11899d891a74-0
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.232
So the little girls in the hot
air balloon basket it with her

71e4e9c4-d8dd-4458-9944-11899d891a74-1
00:21:38.232 --> 00:21:43.050
red crayon or marker and she's
looking down at the clouds.

2f8b6a26-b8c5-4f83-9e29-64ab65c5b7e4-0
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:49.663
And the next picture is one of
the blimp, your blimp type of

2f8b6a26-b8c5-4f83-9e29-64ab65c5b7e4-1
00:21:49.663 --> 00:21:55.356
things, and the other one is the
machine with the like steam

2f8b6a26-b8c5-4f83-9e29-64ab65c5b7e4-2
00:21:55.356 --> 00:22:01.049
coming out of it, the blimp
machine, there's like 3-4 men in

2f8b6a26-b8c5-4f83-9e29-64ab65c5b7e4-3
00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:06.276
it and there's an empty bird
cage in the purple bird is

2f8b6a26-b8c5-4f83-9e29-64ab65c5b7e4-4
00:22:06.276 --> 00:22:11.876
flying away and one of them,
they're holding one of the men

2f8b6a26-b8c5-4f83-9e29-64ab65c5b7e4-5
00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:13.649
out off of the the.

cdbf094c-c621-469f-a04d-28c2c20f747e-0
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.350
Blimp and he's trying to catch
the bird with a net.

d30fdf11-2c35-4650-b63c-417a675b76ab-0
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.110
OK.

7eb0073e-4ded-4750-9ee9-5a01a10ebc4d-0
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.040
OK.

e21cbbb6-758c-4fff-9845-04e1fc32f5f5-0
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.926
Uh, so the girl still in the red
hot air balloon and there's two

e21cbbb6-758c-4fff-9845-04e1fc32f5f5-1
00:22:30.926 --> 00:22:36.332
blimps in the picture, ones on
the above the machine with the

e21cbbb6-758c-4fff-9845-04e1fc32f5f5-2
00:22:36.332 --> 00:22:41.911
steam coming out of it and one's
to the right of it, and now it

e21cbbb6-758c-4fff-9845-04e1fc32f5f5-3
00:22:41.911 --> 00:22:43.830
looks like there is a.

45086f2a-76ad-4c57-9358-d5b0313c3012-0
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.980
Bird cage in the.

e0f386ef-3344-4b6a-92cf-686a4978bb92-0
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.304
Purple Bird is inside of it.
Hmm. And there's some men

e0f386ef-3344-4b6a-92cf-686a4978bb92-1
00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:54.999
standing to the left of the bird
cage. It's he's holding

e0f386ef-3344-4b6a-92cf-686a4978bb92-2
00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:58.110
something. It's hard to tell
what he's holding.

610ef78e-9394-42f7-9c36-a215cc6b78ea-0
00:22:59.180 --> 00:22:59.670


a6e2bc00-589e-43b2-884c-5d06d3f44de9-0
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:09.593
OK, so the little girl
apparently lands her balloon  on

a6e2bc00-589e-43b2-884c-5d06d3f44de9-1
00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:16.133
this steam your machine and
she's gets out and she's walking

a6e2bc00-589e-43b2-884c-5d06d3f44de9-2
00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:20.100
along a ramp holding the red
crayon.

2be5dd05-b1c6-4228-9b98-d59cae82dfff-0
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:27.482
 up above is several people with
the purple standing around the

2be5dd05-b1c6-4228-9b98-d59cae82dfff-1
00:23:27.482 --> 00:23:34.309
purple bird in the cage and then
at the very top. Oh, she climbs

2be5dd05-b1c6-4228-9b98-d59cae82dfff-2
00:23:34.309 --> 00:23:36.830
up a ladder and there's.

caedc88e-3750-42f5-9e2d-88a19df2f244-0
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.260
Sort of um.

f24a6565-1f82-43da-b1f0-3c9afe545e0b-0
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.367
That's not really a stage and
not sure what you would call

f24a6565-1f82-43da-b1f0-3c9afe545e0b-1
00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:51.473
that. And above that is a statue
of a dragon. And there's the

f24a6565-1f82-43da-b1f0-3c9afe545e0b-2
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:55.380
there's a purple, the purple
bird in the cage, and there's

f24a6565-1f82-43da-b1f0-3c9afe545e0b-3
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.023
two people that look like
there's their guards, one on

f24a6565-1f82-43da-b1f0-3c9afe545e0b-4
00:23:59.023 --> 00:24:00.480
each side of the page.

f32ecad8-bdf6-4332-a439-ae431eb30734-0
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:08.747
So the little girl grabs the
bird cage with the purple bird

f32ecad8-bdf6-4332-a439-ae431eb30734-1
00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:13.501
in it, and the guards are
shocked. They're holding Spears

f32ecad8-bdf6-4332-a439-ae431eb30734-2
00:24:13.501 --> 00:24:18.910
and it looks like they're trying
to tell her stop her starting to

f32ecad8-bdf6-4332-a439-ae431eb30734-3
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:19.730
chase her.

eb0a104e-a285-4b5e-9cf3-f3bc6ef86f13-0
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.190
And she runs to the end of one
of these ramps, opens the cage,

eb0a104e-a285-4b5e-9cf3-f3bc6ef86f13-1
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.610
and lets the purple bird out of
the cage.

4a99bf8c-09dc-4b7f-b731-8ff17f226ccd-0
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.090
And that's OK.

36848a67-508b-4bc7-88bf-1235cdcfffae-0
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.269
In well, I mean there's several
layers to this, your Steamboat

36848a67-508b-4bc7-88bf-1235cdcfffae-1
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:44.334
machine, and there looks like
there's a bunch of guards and

36848a67-508b-4bc7-88bf-1235cdcfffae-2
00:24:44.334 --> 00:24:46.910
all the different levels of
this. OK.

4f0828fb-8c5a-4836-9810-faf5628083bb-0
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.452
OK, so two of the guards grab
wonder if that's a little girl

4f0828fb-8c5a-4836-9810-faf5628083bb-1
00:24:56.452 --> 00:25:02.125
or a little boy. Two of the
guards grabbed the the child and

4f0828fb-8c5a-4836-9810-faf5628083bb-2
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:07.798
the bird cages open and one of
the guards is pointing out to

4f0828fb-8c5a-4836-9810-faf5628083bb-3
00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:13.378
the air and the red crayon
appears to be falling down. Ohh.

4f0828fb-8c5a-4836-9810-faf5628083bb-4
00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:19.330
Then two of the guards put the
little girl little boy into the.

bd0757c6-cd65-4024-a91a-7b2dc5968074-0
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.924
Looks like some type of boat
cage and they look like they're

bd0757c6-cd65-4024-a91a-7b2dc5968074-1
00:25:23.924 --> 00:25:26.150
lower hurrying down or some kind
of pulley.

7a1b778b-eef9-45ed-9869-3f4eee0f3632-0
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.880
Ah, OK so.

e959b2bf-3a97-45bb-a086-b110e0c192f9-0
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.520
The little girls in the.

a52a2203-3992-4af1-841c-783f73a77da8-0
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.104
Cage in the Purple Bird was
flying towards her and he

a52a2203-3992-4af1-841c-783f73a77da8-1
00:25:41.104 --> 00:25:45.175
apparently retrieved the red
crayon on and he's bringing it

a52a2203-3992-4af1-841c-783f73a77da8-2
00:25:45.175 --> 00:25:45.990
back to her.

2a9bff66-b65c-4092-8466-7817763def6d-0
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.880
The Little girls jumping up and
down.

f2e71ca4-23c8-4d30-a8bd-95a901f76b4d-0
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:56.509
So the next the girl is drawing
a line, she's drawing a picture

f2e71ca4-23c8-4d30-a8bd-95a901f76b4d-1
00:25:56.509 --> 00:26:01.111
and the birds on her shoulder,
and then she's drawing a

f2e71ca4-23c8-4d30-a8bd-95a901f76b4d-2
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:04.810
rectangle and the bird is flying
around her.

74ce833f-d17c-4e5c-aeb0-0644585533fd-0
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.730
Ohh she.

38f9cc79-2c4d-4dcc-9769-e05f0cca2f53-0
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.570
Had drawn a.

74610b73-2e3c-4e58-9dc1-23550406ae4c-0
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.590
Rug flying carpet, magic carpet
type of thing and she's on it

74610b73-2e3c-4e58-9dc1-23550406ae4c-1
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:27.655
and flying through this fortress
type city with the bird

74610b73-2e3c-4e58-9dc1-23550406ae4c-2
00:26:27.655 --> 00:26:33.254
following or following her in
front of her, flying in front of

74610b73-2e3c-4e58-9dc1-23550406ae4c-3
00:26:33.254 --> 00:26:33.610
her.

8213dde5-3498-49c2-979a-5e551ee57f9a-0
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:44.173
OK, so she flies out on the
magic carpet out into the night

8213dde5-3498-49c2-979a-5e551ee57f9a-1
00:26:44.173 --> 00:26:48.730
sky, and the bird is still in
front of her.

1ac12bc9-e8be-4cc6-bd5a-df0c4e53dac2-0
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.220
So it has three like 3.

9cb26151-5270-4259-ba65-9064e647f1cd-0
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.630
Tails coming out, so I'm not
sure if that's a dragon or if

9cb26151-5270-4259-ba65-9064e647f1cd-1
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.700
that's a bird, but yeah, and
then there's like a palm tree

9cb26151-5270-4259-ba65-9064e647f1cd-2
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.079
nearby in mountains.

06c3c87c-92cd-47c9-9cc1-6d458b09ddc4-0
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:13.764
OK, so little girl lands for
magic carpet next to the palm

06c3c87c-92cd-47c9-9cc1-6d458b09ddc4-1
00:27:13.764 --> 00:27:14.320
tree.

280b8d6a-44b4-4e55-8564-a6c4240a9860-0
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:20.284
Then the purple bird standing by
the palm tree, and there's a

280b8d6a-44b4-4e55-8564-a6c4240a9860-1
00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:23.370
purple door at the base of the
palm tree.

23791d3e-5500-4259-8e09-630acebe05b2-0
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.935
Little girl opens the door and
the bird flies in and she's

23791d3e-5500-4259-8e09-630acebe05b2-1
00:27:28.935 --> 00:27:34.028
still holding the red crayon,
and then the little girl crawls

23791d3e-5500-4259-8e09-630acebe05b2-2
00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:37.560
into the hole in the into the
purple door.

e41cb818-e39b-4ab8-8767-e1cc1fb05567-0
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.310
Ohh, so she crawls out.

379a3c73-679a-4408-ac74-c41c1417983d-0
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.847
Of what looks like the same
purple door, but it's the

379a3c73-679a-4408-ac74-c41c1417983d-1
00:27:49.847 --> 00:27:52.330
mailbox next to her Street in.

8e0d693a-2eae-45f6-b342-3eb887d229d6-0
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:58.223
The Purple Dragon flies out of
in front of her and there's a

8e0d693a-2eae-45f6-b342-3eb887d229d6-1
00:27:58.223 --> 00:28:03.715
little boy running with a purple
crayon and they look happy. And

8e0d693a-2eae-45f6-b342-3eb887d229d6-2
00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:08.784
there's a it's on this looks
like the same street where she

8e0d693a-2eae-45f6-b342-3eb887d229d6-3
00:28:08.784 --> 00:28:12.840
lived before. Green light in the
crosswalk, so.

657e5432-9c75-4c37-bd8d-8d893695f9f6-0
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.850
The little girl and little boy
hold hands or shake hands and.

8bb411d4-0b3e-44f9-8af1-89e43c9f2ac9-0
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.040
The purple bird.

9a6406a8-f84c-4bc3-83b5-f6127c0945cc-0
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:29.777
Um, he's holding the purple bird
in his other hand, and the

9a6406a8-f84c-4bc3-83b5-f6127c0945cc-1
00:28:29.777 --> 00:28:36.164
little girl draws a circle and
the purple bird is on the little

9a6406a8-f84c-4bc3-83b5-f6127c0945cc-2
00:28:36.164 --> 00:28:38.559
boy's shoulder. And then

8160f364-bcbe-4855-a8f8-001362b946ca-0
00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.212
The boy draws a purple circle so
that now they have a red circle

8160f364-bcbe-4855-a8f8-001362b946ca-1
00:28:46.212 --> 00:28:50.268
and a purple circle, and the
purple bird is flying above the

8160f364-bcbe-4855-a8f8-001362b946ca-2
00:28:50.268 --> 00:28:51.000
little boy.

6eedde9d-7df3-4e12-a0af-706cf92dde50-0
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.894
#END_journey Ohh so they drew a
bicycle in like a tandem bicycle

6eedde9d-7df3-4e12-a0af-706cf92dde50-1
00:28:57.894 --> 00:29:02.134
in the little girl in front and
little boy gets in the back of

6eedde9d-7df3-4e12-a0af-706cf92dde50-2
00:29:02.134 --> 00:29:06.173
the bicycle and they start
bicycling and the purple bird is

6eedde9d-7df3-4e12-a0af-706cf92dde50-3
00:29:06.173 --> 00:29:10.547
flying behind them. {OK, so that
was the story. I thought it was

6eedde9d-7df3-4e12-a0af-706cf92dde50-4
00:29:10.547 --> 00:29:11.490
a cute story.}

9f6ab9dc-4e7e-4c60-8d9b-3d851275be47-0
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.792
{I liked it. I like the some of
the pictures were really pretty,

9f6ab9dc-4e7e-4c60-8d9b-3d851275be47-1
00:29:17.792 --> 00:29:18.120
yeah.

b4fd820d-7094-48cc-a566-06694e8fb952-0
00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.360
Alright, so this next one has
around 6 pages.}

320e813b-e92a-4da3-a5e6-4034e9b3bc04-0
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:31.400
#START_arrival-6 Ohh OK, the
first photo there is a.

ea12e28d-1f0d-4cae-b326-766ddad1de2c-0
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.480
Pot or vase.

53cf5045-4093-4d4d-8bc1-0418ead7f18f-0
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.270
Looks like it might be near.

bcba2d5e-82af-4a2b-a00b-d6fd4fb4b72b-0
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:44.228
Oh, it's a mirror, mirror,
mirror. And then something

bcba2d5e-82af-4a2b-a00b-d6fd4fb4b72b-1
00:29:44.228 --> 00:29:44.690
comes.

4f1fbe49-76da-4dbb-a4de-40b140460cd6-0
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:51.071
It looks like a flying like a
bird, but it really doesn't look

4f1fbe49-76da-4dbb-a4de-40b140460cd6-1
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:56.232
quite like a bird. And he has
something in his beak and he

4f1fbe49-76da-4dbb-a4de-40b140460cd6-2
00:29:56.232 --> 00:29:58.420
lands on the vase or pot.

16a89c19-6ff9-478f-8f00-c056333e9f56-0
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.320
And then

a20f438a-78ee-4888-b6a4-c2150b3fcf9c-0
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.070
{How does this go?}

75b6f247-7e08-4d4b-8e24-6daca8423ce2-0
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.380
Um.

f59e1cc4-4ea3-4888-a964-65797570c807-0
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.120
There's looks like a man.

2b61ba9b-6910-4b91-b9a5-9d6b5ccaf51a-0
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.320
Holding a letter.

c6a5b7da-3b2d-42b6-84ea-87d96f8a1d21-0
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.130
And he's walking down some
steps.

b1ed4069-0ba1-4ba7-b78b-da74bd77551f-0
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.190
The more creature with him looks
like a mouse with.

a5c8a2ab-c123-49d1-9a60-7da24293b0f8-0
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.680
I don't know, big Mouse with a
big face.

83ac5c29-54c7-402c-b584-79f102f66c3a-0
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.940
And he stops, and he talks to a
woman.

98dd90f6-28be-47c0-abcf-371271a94f11-0
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:35.140
Who's holding a basket and he
shows her the letter.

ae937afe-9a3e-45c0-8049-764f6e8104e8-0
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:40.458
And whatever this mouse like
lizard type creature is, a

ae937afe-9a3e-45c0-8049-764f6e8104e8-1
00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:44.840
lizard tail is standing beside
him and then they go.

c3fc8240-0f69-48fb-b34a-cdb615859266-0
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:51.136
To a box it actually looks like
an old fashioned type stove, but

c3fc8240-0f69-48fb-b34a-cdb615859266-1
00:30:51.136 --> 00:30:56.247
I guess it's a mailbox. Hmm and
the man and the creature are

c3fc8240-0f69-48fb-b34a-cdb615859266-2
00:30:56.247 --> 00:30:57.420
looking at it.

ee75e38b-c0a3-460e-b09a-701e7825f380-0
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.580
Ohh.

e80242d6-3471-4fdb-8a60-1e578e44d233-0
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.103
In the next picture he they're
showing him writing. {So I guess

e80242d6-3471-4fdb-8a60-1e578e44d233-1
00:31:06.103 --> 00:31:10.108
that's that's not correct. Yeah,
it's, it goes from the yeah, the

e80242d6-3471-4fdb-8a60-1e578e44d233-2
00:31:10.108 --> 00:31:13.871
different page. } OK so after
this creature puts something in

e80242d6-3471-4fdb-8a60-1e578e44d233-3
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:17.633
the vase, the me and is writing
a letter, you can see them in

e80242d6-3471-4fdb-8a60-1e578e44d233-4
00:31:17.633 --> 00:31:21.577
the mirror writing a letter and
there's an old fashioned lamp on

e80242d6-3471-4fdb-8a60-1e578e44d233-5
00:31:21.577 --> 00:31:24.429
the desk and he was writing a
letter with ink.

ec475e8f-bc52-4d4b-a8e0-79cce924af8c-0
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.490
And then he folds the letter.

581eea1c-9fb0-4f83-9f8c-704200bf1b60-0
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.575
Looks like there's money on the
desk. He folds the letter into a

581eea1c-9fb0-4f83-9f8c-704200bf1b60-1
00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:40.020
bird or origami Bird puts it in
the envelope. Then he puts the

581eea1c-9fb0-4f83-9f8c-704200bf1b60-2
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.394
money in the envelope and he
licks the envelope and seals and

581eea1c-9fb0-4f83-9f8c-704200bf1b60-3
00:31:44.394 --> 00:31:48.556
he puts a stamp on it. Then he
takes the envelope down the

581eea1c-9fb0-4f83-9f8c-704200bf1b60-4
00:31:48.556 --> 00:31:48.980
steps.

5ec8685d-58d9-4f52-a9d1-a68fd3c03908-0
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.250
Um, with this mouse lizard type
creature.

257bcc36-ac46-472a-993d-90280d5f0883-0
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.372
Asks, I guess he's showing the
letter to a woman with a basket

257bcc36-ac46-472a-993d-90280d5f0883-1
00:32:03.372 --> 00:32:08.666
and she points to what looks
like a, I guess a mailbox. He

257bcc36-ac46-472a-993d-90280d5f0883-2
00:32:08.666 --> 00:32:14.229
reads something on the mailbox,
the instructions or the times

257bcc36-ac46-472a-993d-90280d5f0883-3
00:32:14.229 --> 00:32:19.702
that he opens the mailbox and
puts the letter in and then he

257bcc36-ac46-472a-993d-90280d5f0883-4
00:32:19.702 --> 00:32:20.510
looks up.

c87b0a19-bc8f-4b00-a735-113ec98fb12b-0
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:27.051
And oh, the mailbox has a some
kind of balloon on it, a Claudio

c87b0a19-bc8f-4b00-a735-113ec98fb12b-1
00:32:27.051 --> 00:32:32.380
balloon. And the the mailbox I
guess floats away up into the

c87b0a19-bc8f-4b00-a735-113ec98fb12b-2
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.710
sky and the man and the mouse
lizard walked away and they're

c87b0a19-bc8f-4b00-a735-113ec98fb12b-3
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.370
in a like a forest.

e73649e0-d667-484e-ba99-d8a2fa2833a5-0
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.070
With leaves, the trees are
leaves. Single leaves OK.

170c93d0-c806-4e85-9a1b-7b305be3facb-0
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.851
OK, so then there's a single
leaf, and then it starts

170c93d0-c806-4e85-9a1b-7b305be3facb-1
00:32:52.851 --> 00:32:53.650
raining.

6f7426aa-3594-4e3c-a8ba-143180927414-0
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.805
and the leaf kinds of splits and
starts splitting in half at the

6f7426aa-3594-4e3c-a8ba-143180927414-1
00:32:59.805 --> 00:33:04.790
top and then split gets bigger
and bigger and then something.

0a17e3b7-ff03-486e-84ba-26eb940410c6-0
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:11.652
In the middle starts growing out
of it and that grows bigger and

0a17e3b7-ff03-486e-84ba-26eb940410c6-1
00:33:11.652 --> 00:33:17.601
bigger and it starts getting a a
circle flower type thing on it

0a17e3b7-ff03-486e-84ba-26eb940410c6-2
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:18.810
and the leaf.

898ff7cb-bc4b-4244-b971-4b940eec6fb6-0
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:25.188
Fall off onto the ground and
then this flower circle type

898ff7cb-bc4b-4244-b971-4b940eec6fb6-1
00:33:25.188 --> 00:33:31.120
thing keeps growing bigger and
bigger and as time goes by the

898ff7cb-bc4b-4244-b971-4b940eec6fb6-2
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.660
leaf is deteriorating on the
ground.

a99a68df-271c-47c2-80ec-3bdb85d0e750-0
00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:36.890
Ohh.

46811e2d-2a72-40a6-8a21-30e4c57706ba-0
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.890
Look like so.

3b8ab1a9-1a5e-4ff0-82db-317e191c43d3-0
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:47.558
Then the the flower with the
design on it gets bright, it

3b8ab1a9-1a5e-4ff0-82db-317e191c43d3-1
00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:51.820
looks like it's glowing bright
and then it.

5b29a5e6-d73d-4294-9d56-7cb047525541-0
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.580
The petals seem to be falling
off and.

6f2754a1-1ef7-42a2-9a67-687ad3217373-0
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.390


a94b68d6-d614-4def-8f6c-b7a25c586104-0
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.730
All the petals fall off.

57c22f86-098c-4053-a6aa-dc02f0d89d5f-0
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:11.144
And then it kind of the flower
kind of changes like it's drying

57c22f86-098c-4053-a6aa-dc02f0d89d5f-1
00:34:11.144 --> 00:34:16.838
up, but it then it looks like it
gets some type of seeds on it,

57c22f86-098c-4053-a6aa-dc02f0d89d5f-2
00:34:16.838 --> 00:34:22.354
then the seeds get big bigger
and the seeds fall off onto the

57c22f86-098c-4053-a6aa-dc02f0d89d5f-3
00:34:22.354 --> 00:34:25.380
ground and then the flowers
just.

ee480807-092f-46a9-8eca-cb1b93f8b7ce-0
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:31.550
Left with nothing on it at all,
and it looks like time is going

ee480807-092f-46a9-8eca-cb1b93f8b7ce-1
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:35.825
by and then the flower starts
deteriorating and falling off

ee480807-092f-46a9-8eca-cb1b93f8b7ce-2
00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:40.101
what's left of the flower onto
the ground and then it looks

ee480807-092f-46a9-8eca-cb1b93f8b7ce-3
00:34:40.101 --> 00:34:41.740
like it starts snowing.

d2feba74-9501-49c0-a998-5347285f4e74-0
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:48.039
And there's there's more and
more snow and the at the end,

d2feba74-9501-49c0-a998-5347285f4e74-1
00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:53.240
the snow is almost covering the
flower at the top of the stem.

1db73d72-453f-4639-a596-1f88cfad95ac-0
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.190
Uh.

f57d5338-1e13-48d8-8e1a-2c2d21713137-0
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.640
What is that?

7760e243-06b6-4686-9cf2-fd63de4fcff0-0
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.000
It's a black and white photo.

ede85b6c-e245-48cb-903d-f1a59d6c0b91-0
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.420
Looks very like.

0ed9069d-1423-4adf-8e03-bf0a79384f38-0
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.970
Futuristic type

aee20746-6920-4fd5-987d-841d76c2291f-0
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.920
Building.

d97c9cd1-3019-4562-9d7c-eb0053a29cc4-0
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:13.540
With.

ad71e381-fa16-4cdc-86f8-a43c7fbaffda-0
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:20.955
Stuff on top of it. It's just
different shapes, cones and

ad71e381-fa16-4cdc-86f8-a43c7fbaffda-1
00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:22.210
circles and.

e511b364-9fbc-4160-b91e-283ddee2287f-0
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:23.900
Umm.

67e03f3f-fb3f-4bc3-afba-a77aebaa2cfa-0
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.420
Like chimneys.

33c342b5-79c4-4a75-b0de-e986efccbfb9-0
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.190
Um.

390d5c7e-9062-43c4-8ff0-33cd131c7d1c-0
00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.256
In the next picture, it looks
like there's things flying

390d5c7e-9062-43c4-8ff0-33cd131c7d1c-1
00:35:37.256 --> 00:35:38.600

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.210
Like a steam ship again and some
kind of bugs and.

52fda4bb-6a2c-43bb-bd9a-a03ab0a0e93b-0
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.050
Bird like creatures and then.

1b4d400f-033f-4e85-a2e3-359c630b3249-0
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:58.465
There is another photo in black
and white and it looks like

1b4d400f-033f-4e85-a2e3-359c630b3249-1
00:35:58.465 --> 00:36:03.123
knuckles and cones again. I mean
it looks like almost teepees and

1b4d400f-033f-4e85-a2e3-359c630b3249-2
00:36:03.123 --> 00:36:03.900

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:11.920
Native American pot wear and
dishes, yeah, yeah.

8da029f1-ba00-4b27-a504-2c181854bcbf-0
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:20.750
Ohh what are they? Do they go in
OK so.

a1f93f6e-144d-4e3c-adac-40b142e1b471-0
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.180
The pot

243fb0bd-a4ae-4c2a-b305-a6c58cbc62f4-0
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:29.717

243fb0bd-a4ae-4c2a-b305-a6c58cbc62f4-1
00:36:29.717 --> 00:36:35.151
it has baby birds inside of the
pot now and it looks like the

243fb0bd-a4ae-4c2a-b305-a6c58cbc62f4-2
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:40.761
bird like creature is bringing
food to the babies birds to feed

243fb0bd-a4ae-4c2a-b305-a6c58cbc62f4-3
00:36:40.761 --> 00:36:41.199
them.

8f803aa8-6dd8-49cf-9ab2-5c78746b7d78-0
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:50.949
And the man ohh the the pot is
like on his window seal and the

8f803aa8-6dd8-49cf-9ab2-5c78746b7d78-1
00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:57.316
man sitting on a bed looking at
the photo of the man woman in

8f803aa8-6dd8-49cf-9ab2-5c78746b7d78-2
00:36:57.316 --> 00:36:59.370
little girl and the.

cf2f1615-d39d-43d4-9ee5-f2229fdc912c-0
00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.899
The mouse lizard type creature
sitting on the bed behind them

cf2f1615-d39d-43d4-9ee5-f2229fdc912c-1
00:37:06.899 --> 00:37:12.194
and he has his shoes on the
floor next to the bed and the

cf2f1615-d39d-43d4-9ee5-f2229fdc912c-2
00:37:12.194 --> 00:37:14.020
desk where he wrote.

8a91e5cf-5a5a-4e59-b548-7c6afbab6027-0
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.700
in the desk and he has clothes
hanging up on a line.

5e04870b-e8ef-442f-a2a4-4d03aeec66dd-0
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:24.800
And there's a lot of letters and
on hanging on the wall.

4f3e13dd-2e50-4e82-89c5-6b4c33326cd4-0
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.468
The Lizard mouse type creature
is on the bed and it looks like

4f3e13dd-2e50-4e82-89c5-6b4c33326cd4-1
00:37:31.468 --> 00:37:34.490
he wakes up and he jumps off the
bed.

2f84030c-95f0-49d8-a3aa-b0ed7e278b75-0
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:41.449
And the man that's holding the
picture looks over to see what

2f84030c-95f0-49d8-a3aa-b0ed7e278b75-1
00:37:41.449 --> 00:37:46.303
the mouse wizard is doing. The
mouse lizard goes down a a

2f84030c-95f0-49d8-a3aa-b0ed7e278b75-2
00:37:46.303 --> 00:37:47.809
ladder and a hole.

024d591a-86b3-45b6-801e-1e29d621a7dc-0
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.350
Are square like a square hole.

09acb316-a41f-4211-83b1-bd49aab25c84-0
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:57.060
So the man climbs down the
ladder and.

44de6792-de4f-4abf-a1cb-ab6a4f1dfba9-0
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:03.321
On the floor next to the mouse
lizard type thing is a letter

44de6792-de4f-4abf-a1cb-ab6a4f1dfba9-1
00:38:03.321 --> 00:38:05.930
and the man picks the letter up.

7302921e-2e48-4dfd-8942-90f89e6cb358-0
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.927
And he opens the letter and he
takes out the origami bird, and

7302921e-2e48-4dfd-8942-90f89e6cb358-1
00:38:12.927 --> 00:38:17.001
he reads the letter and he looks
happy, smiling. And then he

7302921e-2e48-4dfd-8942-90f89e6cb358-2
00:38:17.001 --> 00:38:20.875
looks up, looks like he's
looking out the window, up into

7302921e-2e48-4dfd-8942-90f89e6cb358-3
00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:21.410
the sky.

6a2a8df7-8582-4d79-9fe8-13bf0d614a12-0
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:31.422
So there's another origami
looking creature, sort of like a

6a2a8df7-8582-4d79-9fe8-13bf0d614a12-1
00:38:31.422 --> 00:38:32.450
scorpion.

40ab481c-1838-4ba5-b8a3-362686fc8acf-0
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.540
Type creature.

be637255-4657-4101-874e-15f7c3f64e71-0
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.840
Um.

03c3a307-ca72-480d-bef2-500b9dab1678-0
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:39.920
And there's a.

413ea5da-6154-469e-b083-59b5b9516744-0
00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.040
Try all of the cone shaped.

1fc2f44c-98fb-4a41-999c-73cc42e08a1f-0
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.799
Something, it almost looks like
a heat, a heater or something.

1fc2f44c-98fb-4a41-999c-73cc42e08a1f-1
00:38:51.799 --> 00:38:57.288
And there's some Native American
looking pots or something inside

1fc2f44c-98fb-4a41-999c-73cc42e08a1f-2
00:38:57.288 --> 00:38:59.700
of it. And then there is the.

96988494-2042-4d94-a3f0-ff6f68c015e0-0
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:09.159
Hooks on the wall with the hat
and the scarf again, and a bowl

96988494-2042-4d94-a3f0-ff6f68c015e0-1
00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:15.540
with a strange looking spoon
fork type thing. And there is.

8cf380fd-118b-4ebd-a733-99d0dbb3c08e-0
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.550
Strange looking

9b0963b6-dafd-4703-90d8-a01063f9b55c-0
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:26.226
Uh looks like tails, like animal
tails inside the bowl and almost

9b0963b6-dafd-4703-90d8-a01063f9b55c-1
00:39:26.226 --> 00:39:31.664
like a cactus type plant. And
there is some photos, hand drawn

9b0963b6-dafd-4703-90d8-a01063f9b55c-2
00:39:31.664 --> 00:39:37.015
photos again with the machine,
the Steamboat type machines up

9b0963b6-dafd-4703-90d8-a01063f9b55c-3
00:39:37.015 --> 00:39:42.453
in the ear and some type of sun
or stores something that looks

9b0963b6-dafd-4703-90d8-a01063f9b55c-4
00:39:42.453 --> 00:39:46.509
like it would be in the sky and
then there is.

85e84a04-34f0-4b8a-94ea-4faec30d523a-0
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.030
Some more of these strange.

24441e90-b727-444a-b517-5108095e0555-0
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.460
They almost look like metal
objects.

6ef63cd2-cf87-428b-96ea-2db751c917fe-0
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.243
Like some kind of futuristic
coffee pots, teapots or pops or

6ef63cd2-cf87-428b-96ea-2db751c917fe-1
00:40:03.243 --> 00:40:06.480
toys or something. And then
there's a.

5e1559d0-62b9-4e57-8b4b-382d5d71d90e-0
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.470
It's kind of looks like a
newspaper with very strange.

abb69b4e-6693-4882-98ec-6f00f51489b0-0
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.610
Writing.

bfd8b5cc-7694-4499-adff-f3f4621dd00e-0
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.890
On it with a.

306b3db0-45b9-4e4a-bdc7-379bdbf50b5f-0
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:25.397
coffee or tea cup on top with
steam coming out on a on a

306b3db0-45b9-4e4a-bdc7-379bdbf50b5f-1
00:40:25.397 --> 00:40:30.927
saucer. And then the photo of
the man, woman and little girl

306b3db0-45b9-4e4a-bdc7-379bdbf50b5f-2
00:40:30.927 --> 00:40:36.457
again, and a photo of two hands,
like an adult hand giving a

306b3db0-45b9-4e4a-bdc7-379bdbf50b5f-3
00:40:36.457 --> 00:40:41.897
child's hand a coin in in the
background is that that's the

306b3db0-45b9-4e4a-bdc7-379bdbf50b5f-4
00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:47.427
cup with the hot liquid in it,
OK? And the next photo it's a

306b3db0-45b9-4e4a-bdc7-379bdbf50b5f-5
00:40:47.427 --> 00:40:50.509
man, woman, man, woman and
child.

295ddd09-c228-4b52-984f-83e25a5d50ac-0
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.960
are sitting at a table.

f7937b4c-eb38-4f49-8894-dc5b0c76ad7d-0
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.750
And they have looked cups and
bowls of food and the man is

f7937b4c-eb38-4f49-8894-dc5b0c76ad7d-1
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:05.561
holding up three fingers and
giving this child the coin in

f7937b4c-eb38-4f49-8894-dc5b0c76ad7d-2
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:11.667
the mouse lizard type creatures
down below on the floor below

f7937b4c-eb38-4f49-8894-dc5b0c76ad7d-3
00:41:11.667 --> 00:41:16.690
the table. And he's looking up
at the little girl.

c47239a9-beab-4452-8bf2-ffbfc8e68ae5-0
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.630
all the things that were in the
picture.

3d889786-715e-4f25-be34-f154b8fd880c-0
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:27.804
Before we're all in the picture,
they were yummy. The photos, the

3d889786-715e-4f25-be34-f154b8fd880c-1
00:41:27.804 --> 00:41:33.035
the hat and scarves and the
weird looking stove. So OK, the

3d889786-715e-4f25-be34-f154b8fd880c-2
00:41:33.035 --> 00:41:37.220
next picture is the little girl
putting on her.

0fa0a4b2-0a5e-43a1-b1c2-485207d7dc79-0
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.640
Rain boots again or galoshes
and.

580f9bd6-e63b-4fea-9bda-81af0a013489-0
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:49.547
The mouse lizard type creature
has her winter hat in his mouth

580f9bd6-e63b-4fea-9bda-81af0a013489-1
00:41:49.547 --> 00:41:54.665
and she reaches down and gets
and picks and gets hat, puts the

580f9bd6-e63b-4fea-9bda-81af0a013489-2
00:41:54.665 --> 00:41:56.289
hat on and then she.

9ef706d2-7fdd-4044-bc50-5990c7258e86-0
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:03.084
#END_arrival-6 Goes down the
steps with the mouse lizard type

9ef706d2-7fdd-4044-bc50-5990c7258e86-1
00:42:03.084 --> 00:42:08.141
creature and they are walking
in, jumping over a puddle and

9ef706d2-7fdd-4044-bc50-5990c7258e86-2
00:42:08.141 --> 00:42:12.776
she's pointing down to the
ground at something. To the

9ef706d2-7fdd-4044-bc50-5990c7258e86-3
00:42:12.776 --> 00:42:17.664
mouse lizard type creature,
they're little circles lights

9ef706d2-7fdd-4044-bc50-5990c7258e86-4
00:42:17.664 --> 00:42:22.720
and then she's holding one of
the lights up in her hand and

9ef706d2-7fdd-4044-bc50-5990c7258e86-5
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.670
it's like floating above her
hand.

4ca2e524-f22f-4252-8c7b-5ca51bb50095-0
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.650
{OK, so that was this part.

5fd56c67-2eae-4c02-804d-5044ce83dc17-0
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:31.820
OK.}

61cac2c2-cc41-4778-8a10-f01405669ed6-0
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.148
{How are you doing? Are you OK?
Yeah. OK. OK. So because the

61cac2c2-cc41-4778-8a10-f01405669ed6-1
00:42:38.148 --> 00:42:42.378
next one is really long, I
think, boy. OK. Yeah, this one

61cac2c2-cc41-4778-8a10-f01405669ed6-2
00:42:42.378 --> 00:42:46.244
is long, so you don't have to
spend too much time on

61cac2c2-cc41-4778-8a10-f01405669ed6-3
00:42:46.244 --> 00:42:50.620
individual pages. And this will
be the last one we do. OK.}

9f65a1c9-3854-4ed7-9ed5-9b83ceb5c5a3-0
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.720
{Say.}

76fe395d-ad8b-42c3-96a0-03b16045388e-0
00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:01.460

00:43:16.543 --> 00:43:22.838
something, it looks like a big
piece of paper. And then they

996aa836-4942-4a2d-befd-cba5e075c834-2
00:43:22.838 --> 00:43:28.825

00:43:28.825 --> 00:43:34.811
then they're folding it up.
They're doing it together and

996aa836-4942-4a2d-befd-cba5e075c834-4
00:43:34.811 --> 00:43:36.050

they're lifting it up and it
looks like they're carrying it.

3eda34bf-7349-43fb-96f0-316bd4e93eca-2
00:43:47.143 --> 00:43:47.850
And then?

ee509f0b-bb66-4343-ab16-b3cbed29a80b-0
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.210

00:44:00.205 --> 00:44:04.948
and almost a castle type thing
with flags on it above the water

1d093cfb-a242-4dea-b40b-3cbc42f6d1b4-2
00:44:04.948 --> 00:44:07.320
in the boat and then the little.

7b1d0be4-538d-48bb-a01d-8166e23ebde0-0

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:19.080
Very tiny next to the boat and
it's floating in the water.

f1fefbbe-4747-4f35-880a-a1e0de7a4f36-0
00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.354
OK, here's a picture of it looks
like they are the boats still

f1fefbbe-4747-4f35-880a-a1e0de7a4f36-1
00:44:28.354 --> 00:44:32.801
floating in the water. You can
see the waves and there's

f1fefbbe-4747-4f35-880a-a1e0de7a4f36-2
00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:34.050
several type of.

29496d6f-a882-4b15-9d07-a87896111668-0
00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:41.100
Birds or geese or seagulls
flying overhead.

2bf5d640-65fa-495f-a733-80d46f572c6b-0
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:51.107
OK, so there's three turtles in
the water and they're looking at

2bf5d640-65fa-495f-a733-80d46f572c6b-1
00:44:51.107 --> 00:44:57.248
this paper boat that the men
made and one of the birds is has

2bf5d640-65fa-495f-a733-80d46f572c6b-2
00:44:57.248 --> 00:44:59.129
landed on the boat.

2cd41c48-1650-4069-a03e-b166509d1bc0-0
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.480
And then it looks ohh like a
possibly a wheel.

26c2e681-7ae0-4341-ad65-0aa91d6fb986-0
00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.750
Coming up out of the water and
looking at the boat.

966a491a-ff91-4f41-98a7-b56c34df25d1-0
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.690
Ohh so then there's the showing
under the water. There's the

966a491a-ff91-4f41-98a7-b56c34df25d1-1
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:25.264
wheel and his flippers like
holding the boat up in the ear.

966a491a-ff91-4f41-98a7-b56c34df25d1-2
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:29.380
And there's a swordfish and
coral reef and a bunch of

966a491a-ff91-4f41-98a7-b56c34df25d1-3

of fish.

a5b4bddd-a689-4da5-98ba-b3a056e33d1b-0
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:42.273
So it's still underwater and you
can see the the paper boat

a5b4bddd-a689-4da5-98ba-b3a056e33d1b-1
00:45:42.273 --> 00:45:48.246
floating right above the water
and there's tons of fish and

a5b4bddd-a689-4da5-98ba-b3a056e33d1b-2
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:52.030
coral reefs all underneath the
water.

1b417ecf-6bae-422d-9ec8-8df830b1977d-0
00:45:55.650 --> 00:46:00.516
OK so there is a boat still
floating over the coral reef.

1b417ecf-6bae-422d-9ec8-8df830b1977d-1
00:46:00.516 --> 00:46:05.550
There's different looks like
some kind of octopus or squids

1b417ecf-6bae-422d-9ec8-8df830b1977d-2
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:10.919
or something like that. Like one
is this attached itself to the

1b417ecf-6bae-422d-9ec8-8df830b1977d-3
00:46:10.919 --> 00:46:15.450
boat underneath from underneath
on the water there's.

37c79796-55fa-4776-81d7-baf270cff145-0
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:22.080
Kind of two fish type people
kissing under the water.

a9ba7354-1570-4ca9-94ed-dbcf6b41bf07-0
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:31.497
And ohh the paper boat now has a
fishing rod on it and it looks

a9ba7354-1570-4ca9-94ed-dbcf6b41bf07-1
00:46:31.497 --> 00:46:34.130
like it caught a fish.

4e425926-c329-4411-9e86-60120895e62a-0
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.941
OK, so the boat still floating

4e425926-c329-4411-9e86-60120895e62a-1
00:46:46.941 --> 00:46:52.774
the fish are looking at it and
one of the like a sea horse type

octangular paper hat and he's

4e425926-c329-4411-9e86-60120895e62a-3
00:46:58.334 --> 00:47:03.984
standing on top of another fish
and looking at the paper boat

4e425926-c329-4411-9e86-60120895e62a-4
00:47:03.984 --> 00:47:05.990
floating in the water.

e05decc5-face-403d-95fd-1833b9580a18-0
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.800
So then he gets on the boat.

eb010041-3ac2-4f89-ad35-49bb2c69e4cb-0
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:17.780
Um, and there's something

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.460
It's hard to tell what it is

kind of.

e54f7f5a-c99d-40aa-afa2-a4ade906662c-0
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.128
Plants coming out of the water
with the roots attached down

e54f7f5a-c99d-40aa-afa2-a4ade906662c-1
00:48:09.128 --> 00:48:13.080

6aacc9c1-e22a-4eed-ae78-f794e19aab03-0
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.720
It looks like it's getting dark
and there's a lot of animals

6aacc9c1-e22a-4eed-ae78-f794e19aab03-1
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.270

In his hands, little arms with
hands reaching out.

04e4aaaa-7a7d-4153-820b-faa70663a96e-0
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:08.983
Oh, it looks like they're
alligators or something. OK,

04e4aaaa-7a7d-4153-820b-faa70663a96e-1
00:49:08.983 --> 00:49:10.600
crocodiles. Alligators, OK.

22037c87-f399-4b06-a1bc-46fd19625791-0
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:18.400
OK, so the boat is still
floating along. It looks like

22037c87-f399-4b06-a1bc-46fd19625791-1
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.552
they're floating out of this
dark marshy area into open water

22037c87-f399-4b06-a1bc-46fd19625791-2
00:49:23.552 --> 00:49:28.621
again. And the seahorse is on
the boat and he's looking down

22037c87-f399-4b06-a1bc-46fd19625791-3
00:49:28.621 --> 00:49:33.607
into the water, and then he
either jumps or he falls out of

22037c87-f399-4b06-a1bc-46fd19625791-4
00:49:33.607 --> 00:49:38.593
the boat and there's a bunch of
other seahorses next to him

22037c87-f399-4b06-a1bc-46fd19625791-5
00:49:38.593 --> 00:49:42.000
looking up at him and his hat
falls off.

94e22c8e-88ea-42d6-b578-338bc8c9cb73-0
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.400
And there's a bunch of more.

4ad41c4b-df4c-46ec-80f8-15d030716f4d-0

the water, under the ground
eels.

73c8a956-c03f-495e-9d49-81f40cec0800-0
00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.854
OK, so the boat keeps floating
along and now there's nothing

73c8a956-c03f-495e-9d49-81f40cec0800-1
00:50:00.854 --> 00:50:05.682

OK, what is happening now?

2904648b-dfa1-4da2-86ac-fda1a11844fa-0
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:21.733
It looks like they're still in

2904648b-dfa1-4da2-86ac-fda1a11844fa-1
00:51:21.733 --> 00:51:25.050
different kinds of creatures in
the water.

58e78c57-a984-428c-b9d6-7b888050d768-0
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.282
I don't even know if that's
water. There's the boat, still

58e78c57-a984-428c-b9d6-7b888050d768-1
00:51:29.282 --> 00:51:32.097
floating, and it looks like a
cap is jumping now into the

58e78c57-a984-428c-b9d6-7b888050d768-2
00:51:32.097 --> 00:51:32.340
boat.

36b00d74-68fc-47a3-b408-61220e3887a7-0
00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:40.057
There's alligators and zebra
looking and leopards and dogs

36b00d74-68fc-47a3-b408-61220e3887a7-1
00:51:40.057 --> 00:51:40.430
and.

86ee44ed-6b77-488b-9d1c-fb730f9bd302-0
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.600
Elephants and flying creatures
and.

6be54007-b2da-40a6-aa17-f2157df5ff9c-0
00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.350
Um, some kind of lizards and.

ba312b1a-153a-4fa2-81f2-e8ee5fdfec3f-0
00:51:54.130 --> 00:52:00.230
Looks like almost a moon type
creature, but it has fins like

ba312b1a-153a-4fa2-81f2-e8ee5fdfec3f-1
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.430
a.

3421277c-27bf-47a2-b216-da919ad4754a-0
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:06.260
Fish, Bats and butterflies.

8f90b052-1e47-45eb-bf5a-a88a9bb266c1-0
00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.618
Butterfly birds. So the the
paper boats still floating on

8f90b052-1e47-45eb-bf5a-a88a9bb266c1-1
00:52:13.618 --> 00:52:17.941
the water. Now it's night time
and everything's dark and

8f90b052-1e47-45eb-bf5a-a88a9bb266c1-2
00:52:17.941 --> 00:52:22.794
there's a billion stars in the
sky and you can see a planet far

8f90b052-1e47-45eb-bf5a-a88a9bb266c1-3
00:52:22.794 --> 00:52:27.268
off. And there's like a sliver
of a moon up in the sky and

8f90b052-1e47-45eb-bf5a-a88a9bb266c1-4
00:52:27.268 --> 00:52:32.122
underneath the water you can see
the eyes of all the schools of

8f90b052-1e47-45eb-bf5a-a88a9bb266c1-5
00:52:32.122 --> 00:52:34.169
fish under under the water.

e8b8764f-3ede-45ea-8240-e3346ec72f5a-0
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:43.620
OK, so then the boat suddenly
gets surrounded by.

7140d11c-3195-4db6-8150-48ebfe08bbec-0
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:50.396
Massive school of fish with
glowing eyes and it's still dark

7140d11c-3195-4db6-8150-48ebfe08bbec-1
00:52:50.396 --> 00:52:51.100
outside.

427b12e0-5201-4039-adfc-9f3cbfe83292-0
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.630
OK, so then the boat keeps
floating and the fish I guess go

427b12e0-5201-4039-adfc-9f3cbfe83292-1
00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:02.630
back into the water and kind of
float away and then up in the

427b12e0-5201-4039-adfc-9f3cbfe83292-2
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:06.760
sky. Well, there's all the stars
still, but it's almost like a.

ff242e20-d39b-4332-9725-c5ccfc21f6ae-0
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.993
Northern light type of thing up
in the sky, but it's all the

ff242e20-d39b-4332-9725-c5ccfc21f6ae-1
00:53:11.993 --> 00:53:15.324
pictures, all black and white,
so you can't really see any

ff242e20-d39b-4332-9725-c5ccfc21f6ae-2
00:53:15.324 --> 00:53:15.720
colors.

7e9ab54f-ecfb-418c-a4ac-7d613f4c31d5-0
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.238
Ohh, so now all the boats still
floating along and it looks like

7e9ab54f-ecfb-418c-a4ac-7d613f4c31d5-1
00:53:24.238 --> 00:53:26.710
he's passing a giant iceberg.

624669e4-9394-418d-b6c2-fad6697c60df-0
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:36.977
So he's floating along and he
goes inside either a cave or

624669e4-9394-418d-b6c2-fad6697c60df-1
00:53:36.977 --> 00:53:42.354
ice, and he's floating through a
maze of different channels

624669e4-9394-418d-b6c2-fad6697c60df-2
00:53:42.354 --> 00:53:47.462
inside the ice. And from the
outside you can see sort of

624669e4-9394-418d-b6c2-fad6697c60df-3
00:53:47.462 --> 00:53:50.330
mountain tops with snow on them.

d65c54b2-2f15-4a75-9fa2-36744f7caf89-0
00:53:55.420 --> 00:54:02.802
Oh, this is floating along. And
now these icebergs look like

d65c54b2-2f15-4a75-9fa2-36744f7caf89-1
00:54:02.802 --> 00:54:06.070
they might be some kind of.

dc4fd438-1cea-4391-be18-6908c9b2920e-0
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.400
Feet.

fdf8a938-033f-4036-9a2f-ad67cd989ae7-0
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:15.411
With almost toes on them and
there as he's floating along and

fdf8a938-033f-4036-9a2f-ad67cd989ae7-1
00:54:15.411 --> 00:54:20.332
still in the ocean, there are
some kind of light coming up

fdf8a938-033f-4036-9a2f-ad67cd989ae7-2
00:54:20.332 --> 00:54:25.170
from under the water, shining on
the boat again and then.

8dcf1b18-f263-4e04-9c06-04fde7c041b0-0
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:27.360
Um.

8177bb8a-8a84-44be-9e42-021553cca0da-0
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:36.837
Uh, a scuba diver comes out and
he has a whole scuba outfit on

8177bb8a-8a84-44be-9e42-021553cca0da-1
00:54:36.837 --> 00:54:42.040
in the the A mask, but he has
fins on the mask.

78d1a85d-ee21-4aa3-86ed-a9b3373770ba-0
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:47.140
Looks like he comes up and he
picks up the boat.

338ee5e2-21a7-44e8-855e-fc6a9bb7caad-0
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:52.510
Out of the water and there's
light to still shining. There's

338ee5e2-21a7-44e8-855e-fc6a9bb7caad-1
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.438
a bunch of weird lights with
tubes coming out of them and

338ee5e2-21a7-44e8-855e-fc6a9bb7caad-2
00:54:56.438 --> 00:54:58.470
shining the light on the boat.

c1a4b26e-2706-40e8-bb40-c5fac53e9fa7-0
00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:08.615
OK, so the boat is on, floating
along in the water again and the

c1a4b26e-2706-40e8-bb40-c5fac53e9fa7-1
00:55:08.615 --> 00:55:13.452
light with the tube is still
sticking out of the water and a

c1a4b26e-2706-40e8-bb40-c5fac53e9fa7-2
00:55:13.452 --> 00:55:13.770
big.

1f972338-01c8-4fee-8787-d9d936127343-0
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:21.957
Steamship starts coming past and
there's an angler and some more

1f972338-01c8-4fee-8787-d9d936127343-1
00:55:21.957 --> 00:55:28.300
bird seagull type of birds and
it's floating in the water.

568a6156-666b-416e-8831-f245320ed499-0
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:39.430
So the boat is still floating in
the water, and now it's.

7d459bc8-d2c2-4e66-9575-6fac041f21ca-0
00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:47.126
Dark again, and the birds seemed
to be getting sick, and it's all

7d459bc8-d2c2-4e66-9575-6fac041f21ca-1
00:55:47.126 --> 00:55:53.386
it's smoke and steam from some
kind of looks like a factory

7d459bc8-d2c2-4e66-9575-6fac041f21ca-2
00:55:53.386 --> 00:55:55.890
coming out of the water.

cfd4ef01-edad-4663-8002-3646af09e9c8-0
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:02.137
The birds look like they're
falling into the water I got

cfd4ef01-edad-4663-8002-3646af09e9c8-1
00:56:02.137 --> 00:56:03.500
sick or dying from.

03716770-5d38-4dad-a119-08e3330a9d02-0
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.190
OK.

96b62091-d7f5-4d61-b36d-b47bfe430cf2-0
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.290
So it looks like.

efe5c5ae-ba37-412a-bb1d-8f55d492af11-0
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:23.160
This factory and there's windows
all up along the.

a9e2a5a6-f8b0-4aae-bf07-1cb3ec8f0df9-0
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:31.613
Tower of the factory or
smokestack, and there's people

a9e2a5a6-f8b0-4aae-bf07-1cb3ec8f0df9-1
00:56:31.613 --> 00:56:33.460
with masks on in.

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-0
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:40.307
Outfits, and they're shooting
down below and it looks like

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-1
00:56:40.307 --> 00:56:45.003
they're shooting. They shoot a
hole in the boat, the little

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-2
00:56:45.003 --> 00:56:49.698
paper boat, and they're shooting
at somebody who's riding a

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-3
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:54.394
rocket in the water. And there
they have some kind of claw,

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-4
00:56:54.394 --> 00:56:59.090
like anchor coming down. And
then the person that's on this

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-5
00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:04.099
rocket stands on the tip of the
rocket and the boat, the little

fbbe064d-93ed-4b26-9f42-19313e016120-6
00:57:04.099 --> 00:57:04.960
paper boat.

906367b4-d894-49d1-84db-d0c0579e38e1-0
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.806
Just below him with a whole now
where they shot the boat and I

906367b4-d894-49d1-84db-d0c0579e38e1-1
00:57:08.806 --> 00:57:10.660
like preserver inside the boat.

d226daf1-87bc-41b2-800b-88d203a52304-0
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:20.172
Um, so the person, the scuba,
scuba diver type person that was

d226daf1-87bc-41b2-800b-88d203a52304-1
00:57:20.172 --> 00:57:25.841
on the rocket I guess is now in
the water and he has a he's

d226daf1-87bc-41b2-800b-88d203a52304-2
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:29.810
holding on to the paper boat
with a rope.

aaba9203-53a1-4fb3-b61c-3eb8285429d6-0
00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.520
East on the water and.

d42a7713-9617-499f-bb31-96cbc4905c3f-0
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.900
Oh, there's a smaller boat.

ade21165-c3a4-4125-882d-7dea385687c0-0
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.380
Coming next to them with a kite.

42607a45-f74e-4f0f-8070-3317b04d6094-0
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:48.150
And there's strange creatures.
There's the creature who made

42607a45-f74e-4f0f-8070-3317b04d6094-1
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:53.141
the boat with the horn on his
head and in the costume. And

42607a45-f74e-4f0f-8070-3317b04d6094-2
00:57:53.141 --> 00:57:57.710
some other strange looking
creatures, animals. Horse.

711a86b0-d0bf-4619-a672-8071635d5456-0
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.627
Some kind of reindeer, but
they're all checkered and

711a86b0-d0bf-4619-a672-8071635d5456-1
00:58:02.627 --> 00:58:06.463
spotted and stars on them. And
it looks like there's two

711a86b0-d0bf-4619-a672-8071635d5456-2
00:58:06.463 --> 00:58:10.636
people, like look like little
alien people, and there's a cat

711a86b0-d0bf-4619-a672-8071635d5456-3
00:58:10.636 --> 00:58:12.050
inside this boat, OK.

154dfcb7-8096-43d3-9a4d-f791d584d505-0
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:21.870
So a giant wave comes in the
paper boat is now.

566ed82d-74d2-4433-a14d-82a33ae01197-0
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:29.125
Stuck in the middle of this
giant wave in the curl of the

566ed82d-74d2-4433-a14d-82a33ae01197-1
00:58:29.125 --> 00:58:29.670
wave.

bbbdee2f-1cce-4864-ae15-14096bbc018b-0
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.600
In these.

7bf088d8-cc0d-497c-aaca-4fce1ea1b88a-0
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.760
Creatures that are coming after
them in the big are the bigger,

7bf088d8-cc0d-497c-aaca-4fce1ea1b88a-1
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.340
but now looks like a seashell.

747fd68e-bb0d-4157-9bb4-77f81d872182-0
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:45.170
The kite and the kite has ripped
and they have another like paper

747fd68e-bb0d-4157-9bb4-77f81d872182-1
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:50.012
airplane that the guy in the
costume with the horn on his

747fd68e-bb0d-4157-9bb4-77f81d872182-2
00:58:50.012 --> 00:58:55.105
head is holding in the cats,
walking on the wire towards the

747fd68e-bb0d-4157-9bb4-77f81d872182-3
00:58:55.105 --> 00:58:55.690
height.

b798afa6-1ced-4c24-a3c4-c747d92cc5b4-0
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.150
And now the paper boat is still
sailing, and it's like.

cebba81a-2fac-41f6-bdc4-07bad82716d7-0
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:08.878
I guess there's some type of
storm coming, and there's

cebba81a-2fac-41f6-bdc4-07bad82716d7-1
00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:13.146
lightning coming out of the
clouds and down into the water

cebba81a-2fac-41f6-bdc4-07bad82716d7-2
00:59:13.146 --> 00:59:17.413
into the ocean. And the paper
airplane that the guy in the

cebba81a-2fac-41f6-bdc4-07bad82716d7-3
00:59:17.413 --> 00:59:21.753
costume with the horn on his
head was holding before is now

cebba81a-2fac-41f6-bdc4-07bad82716d7-4
00:59:21.753 --> 00:59:23.490
sailing through the sky.

9cacd008-fea2-4f8e-a199-62cc9896987f-0
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:33.915
Ohh so the sailboat start
sailing into these curls that

9cacd008-fea2-4f8e-a199-62cc9896987f-1
00:59:33.915 --> 00:59:41.357
look like some kind of eel or
sea creature. Some of its inside

9cacd008-fea2-4f8e-a199-62cc9896987f-2
00:59:41.357 --> 00:59:48.327
the water and some of it's
outside of the water and as the

9cacd008-fea2-4f8e-a199-62cc9896987f-3
00:59:48.327 --> 00:59:54.470
sailboats sailing into this the
eel type creatures.

890ab24e-c404-4dd5-806e-bb199a0d20b5-0
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:59.650
Seems to be catching the paper
airplane into his mouth. Hmm.

ebb32e50-295b-484b-83ad-db6b1f53587e-0
01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:09.210
So this eel seal type creature.

61b43bd9-0017-4763-88ac-0410c3339ae2-0
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:18.829
Looks like he's his head in his
head he has teeth and his eyes

61b43bd9-0017-4763-88ac-0410c3339ae2-1
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:24.942
are glowing and the the paper
boat with the hole from being

61b43bd9-0017-4763-88ac-0410c3339ae2-2
01:00:24.942 --> 01:00:29.120
shot is still sailing through
all these.

100a3db4-9746-4790-b921-320c4ccd10ba-0
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:33.954
eel type things and then you
could start seeing their faces

100a3db4-9746-4790-b921-320c4ccd10ba-1
01:00:33.954 --> 01:00:37.793
and heads, and they all have
glowing eyes, and one of them

100a3db4-9746-4790-b921-320c4ccd10ba-2
01:00:37.793 --> 01:00:39.680
has a giant horn on his head.

d03ff1b3-89e2-455e-ba31-081e449171f7-0
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:53.233
And the pen the paper boat keeps
sailing along in these creatures

d03ff1b3-89e2-455e-ba31-081e449171f7-1
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:53.500
or

e1b70102-b278-4cd3-8b47-934171866b25-0
01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:00.440
Blowing water out of their nose
nostrils I guess. And it looks

e1b70102-b278-4cd3-8b47-934171866b25-1
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.951
like almost like a waterfall and
the paper boats sailing through

e1b70102-b278-4cd3-8b47-934171866b25-2
01:01:05.951 --> 01:01:11.037
it and it's getting flooded by
all this water coming out of

e1b70102-b278-4cd3-8b47-934171866b25-3
01:01:11.037 --> 01:01:15.700
this eels nostrils. And then
there's another fish type

e1b70102-b278-4cd3-8b47-934171866b25-4
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.210
creature with a bathing suit on
standing on land and there's all

e1b70102-b278-4cd3-8b47-934171866b25-5
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:25.109
kinds of trash on the land,
bottles and cans.

7819db62-a0ad-46c8-afbe-74ec2167e7c4-0
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.180
Pieces of paper.

f657bd0e-3f51-4ab4-b028-a33c76884aed-0
01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:36.068
OK, so the next picture looks
like the boat is sinking under

f657bd0e-3f51-4ab4-b028-a33c76884aed-1
01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:36.990
the water.

6ed0e6dc-c8b8-461d-8197-5d0d034952a4-0
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.970
And there was all kinds of
jellyfish in the water and.

2f175f07-9e41-4aac-bf11-4a88d70a802b-0
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.700
I don't know. It's just a bunch
of jellyfish all over the place.

12f7f851-2725-4624-a712-4260b5df5538-0
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.900
So the boat looks like it's
sinking down into the water and

12f7f851-2725-4624-a712-4260b5df5538-1
01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.901
it's getting like I guess he's
getting really deep into the

12f7f851-2725-4624-a712-4260b5df5538-2
01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:03.969
water. It's getting darker and
darker and there's schools of

12f7f851-2725-4624-a712-4260b5df5538-3
01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:05.370
fish and octopus and.

2658cd6e-413f-4cde-a33c-5c35fc5db18f-0
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:12.816
Jellyfish and it's it's he's the
paper boat just keeps sinking

2658cd6e-413f-4cde-a33c-5c35fc5db18f-1
01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:15.020
into the darkness. Dark water.

4211ae6d-2fbe-4c04-a75b-0d8a334d75f6-0
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:24.579
OK, so I think the boat must
have landed on the bottom of

4211ae6d-2fbe-4c04-a75b-0d8a334d75f6-1
01:02:24.579 --> 01:02:25.820
this ocean.

a8eff702-e011-4867-959e-d7f991f63a44-0
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:32.373
You can see the sun shining
through down to the bottom and

a8eff702-e011-4867-959e-d7f991f63a44-1
01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:37.908
some kind of creatures. Three
creatures are crawling up into

a8eff702-e011-4867-959e-d7f991f63a44-2
01:02:37.908 --> 01:02:39.270
the paper boat.

b1c7d588-12bb-46c4-8179-09b9ebe6c33b-0
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:49.230
And there's a sunken looks like
a submarine might be a blimp.

177b9e9c-a11a-413b-a8e9-7dfd06851315-0
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:55.984
Down into the water and there is
different fish looking at it in

177b9e9c-a11a-413b-a8e9-7dfd06851315-1
01:02:55.984 --> 01:03:01.193
some kind of giant eel and the
boat is stuck on the tip of the

177b9e9c-a11a-413b-a8e9-7dfd06851315-2
01:03:01.193 --> 01:03:02.020
submarine.

de24694b-c2e9-469b-a055-31fe6b20bbc1-0
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:10.054
And now the submarines got
coming up out of the water again

de24694b-c2e9-469b-a055-31fe6b20bbc1-1
01:03:10.054 --> 01:03:14.847
in the paper boat, still on the
tip of the the submarine and the

de24694b-c2e9-469b-a055-31fe6b20bbc1-2
01:03:14.847 --> 01:03:15.290
water.

2dd7da2c-2416-493d-8e3d-bb8a1cd0a4d9-0
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.509
Spilling out back of from the
paper boat is spilling back into

2dd7da2c-2416-493d-8e3d-bb8a1cd0a4d9-1
01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:21.160
the ocean.

c7446aee-9f33-4e2a-8022-2c3b8ada193d-0
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.060
And.

ec071017-7f98-46cf-bbbd-b09be0785c9f-0
01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:29.586
What the heck is some kind of
boat with people on it and it's

ec071017-7f98-46cf-bbbd-b09be0785c9f-1
01:03:29.586 --> 01:03:30.670
being attacked

ac8653a5-167f-487a-b0cb-89710cb0be4f-0
01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:36.380
By uh some type of octopus squid
type creature.

a0a3b39f-9384-41bd-a6a5-3636e5e468ed-0
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.180
Almost looks like a a whale
also. Oh, I guess I don't know

a0a3b39f-9384-41bd-a6a5-3636e5e468ed-1
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.296
what that is, yeah. Anyways,
it's attacking the boat and the

a0a3b39f-9384-41bd-a6a5-3636e5e468ed-2
01:03:46.296 --> 01:03:50.682
boat looks like the the back end
of it is sinking into the water

a0a3b39f-9384-41bd-a6a5-3636e5e468ed-3
01:03:50.682 --> 01:03:54.865
and the paper boat is up above
the water again floating above

a0a3b39f-9384-41bd-a6a5-3636e5e468ed-4
01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:55.270
above.

9b21f353-dcee-4578-a57c-7ccc66a199b2-0
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.690
OK so then.

e5979561-87df-4b4c-ad31-2ba81c67ad25-0
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:05.132
I guess a group of seals come
along and they are playing with

e5979561-87df-4b4c-ad31-2ba81c67ad25-1
01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:09.811
the boat. The one one of the
seals is balancing the paper

e5979561-87df-4b4c-ad31-2ba81c67ad25-2
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:10.780
boat on his.

5563d5a8-9c69-4951-9713-8f29c63ff1c9-0
01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.410
Mouth.

2f1d39a5-7d99-4468-a2f6-db836d91327b-0
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:19.415
Super small. And then under the
waters a bunch of reefs and fish

2f1d39a5-7d99-4468-a2f6-db836d91327b-1
01:04:19.415 --> 01:04:20.780
again and seals.

abfe45e0-631a-4256-99de-b793c58867b7-0
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:23.350
and there's clouds in the sky.

aa19d134-4cdf-47d3-8368-0bd64cdcafe5-0
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:30.560
OK, so the paper boats floating
along again and there's.

7b951fb1-9fa2-4c91-a7c8-5b938a03ce43-0
01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.250
All kinds of.

33b6e60d-05ce-437a-ac74-4a6a7095c8cb-0
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:40.174
Be fishing creatures in the
water. Fish, jellyfish. Um.

33b6e60d-05ce-437a-ac74-4a6a7095c8cb-1
01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:46.191
Below the water is the scuba
diver again. He's holding some

33b6e60d-05ce-437a-ac74-4a6a7095c8cb-2
01:04:46.191 --> 01:04:52.307
kind of ball that looks like
it's lit up and there's bubbles

33b6e60d-05ce-437a-ac74-4a6a7095c8cb-3
01:04:52.307 --> 01:04:53.310
coming up.

5029ef25-a403-44c5-b978-9f4eaf8310f4-0
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.700
The surface from the scuba
divers helmet.

a3805d0a-20d6-4188-b73d-2046eefc8328-0
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:07.665
So the boat is still floating
along and see the scuba divers

a3805d0a-20d6-4188-b73d-2046eefc8328-1
01:05:07.665 --> 01:05:13.128
riding some kind of sea squid
creature up above the water and

a3805d0a-20d6-4188-b73d-2046eefc8328-2
01:05:13.128 --> 01:05:18.591
there's a like a a buoy and a
lighthouse and there's animals,

a3805d0a-20d6-4188-b73d-2046eefc8328-3
01:05:18.591 --> 01:05:24.319
some kind of fish type creatures
and fish on the on the buoy and

a3805d0a-20d6-4188-b73d-2046eefc8328-4
01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:28.989
the this paper boats still
floating the wrong wrong.

1045d14d-722b-4bb5-b32e-d2cec5347491-0
01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:33.001
Ask the lighthouse or somebody
next to the lighthouse looking

1045d14d-722b-4bb5-b32e-d2cec5347491-1
01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:36.680
out into the water and there's
several ships floating by.

72b29228-a6de-442c-8055-58ce4bad38db-0
01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.640
OK, so.

7fd043ce-2288-41fb-968a-99800fb9edf8-0
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.950
The ships are floating by and
the paper boats floating by and

7fd043ce-2288-41fb-968a-99800fb9edf8-1
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:51.450
he goes across a.

a137c652-c157-4920-a1c1-17eb5b5b4ee0-0
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:58.066
Sort of a a boardwalk. Part of
it's under the water, part of

a137c652-c157-4920-a1c1-17eb5b5b4ee0-1
01:05:58.066 --> 01:06:04.196
it's above the water, and it's a
long boardwalk with some kind of

a137c652-c157-4920-a1c1-17eb5b5b4ee0-2
01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:06.240
circular gondola type.

a4ddd362-359e-4c35-8487-5380ac9b94cc-0
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.915
Like a viewing station. At the
end of it there's a bunch of

a4ddd362-359e-4c35-8487-5380ac9b94cc-1
01:06:11.915 --> 01:06:13.930
steamboats and sailboats.

a3b232ff-b4b8-49fd-a06f-c0faf07b0007-0
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.390
And there's fish under under the
water.

4ff36e7c-fe0b-489f-babb-b54c778ac16f-0
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.180


78aecb89-c14d-4dc3-b800-b99502f586e6-0
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.200
So what is this?

4f6963ea-0d9e-4002-aa82-05f30baf19ee-0
01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:31.984
The boats still the the paper
boats still sailing along.

4f6963ea-0d9e-4002-aa82-05f30baf19ee-1
01:06:31.984 --> 01:06:36.429
There's giant ships in the
water, smaller ships sailboats,

4f6963ea-0d9e-4002-aa82-05f30baf19ee-2
01:06:36.429 --> 01:06:41.175
submarines, and like a ceiling
that looks like they're getting

4f6963ea-0d9e-4002-aa82-05f30baf19ee-3
01:06:41.175 --> 01:06:43.360
close to a some type of city.

6bb2e507-3863-4435-892d-fdae71cd9453-0
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:54.750
OK, so the boat is still sailing
along. There's a wheel.

be16fd0a-cb44-4835-a19e-b839740783ca-0
01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:01.270
Ohh with something attached to
them with water coming down on

be16fd0a-cb44-4835-a19e-b839740783ca-1
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:02.010
his head.

92d46565-246b-4848-87d4-7e19fe119216-0
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:07.728
There's people in row boats now.
There's Bowie buoy, whatever

92d46565-246b-4848-87d4-7e19fe119216-1
01:07:07.728 --> 01:07:10.985
they're called, they're
sailboats. There's regular

92d46565-246b-4848-87d4-7e19fe119216-2
01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.389
boats, there's people.

2994e736-d436-4f85-894d-01b9eeb39bfc-0
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.000
Looking out into the water.

f9e0cf61-b7fb-4148-8a3f-1161be0c2ddf-0
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:22.550
At the different ships and the
sailboats still sailing along.

2831c6f3-a696-4e6f-b286-94768149acda-0
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:31.104
So the sailboat still sailing
along. It looks like he's

2831c6f3-a696-4e6f-b286-94768149acda-1
01:07:31.104 --> 01:07:33.200
sailing into a harbor.

34450f7d-793c-4744-80f5-6afd1608e6f3-0
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:39.290
More people, more boats,
different activities going on.

d64e3926-b952-4777-88a0-be6e459fba2c-0
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.300
Like a dock

b601961b-fe0a-4be4-ba8d-757df4a22564-0
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.940
cranes

77f08ed2-169b-40b7-9d09-198eb38c5376-0
01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:52.902
Different things. There's little
boy and a some kind of weird

77f08ed2-169b-40b7-9d09-198eb38c5376-1
01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.730
observation circle.

ee362a10-60fa-4978-a2f8-52bc68d83b78-0
01:07:56.310 --> 01:08:00.722
Thing. And yeah, it looks like a
dog with workers on it, with

ee362a10-60fa-4978-a2f8-52bc68d83b78-1
01:08:00.722 --> 01:08:02.360
cranes, with doors and.

2b51756c-7bde-4910-ae7d-a9e20bafdb60-0
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.530
Containers. Hmm.

e577ba93-85a0-485f-9d72-9ad44d0af301-0
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.150
OK.

6143feb0-1cc1-4619-93ea-b17e62a584eb-0
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:17.818
So the little paper boats still
sailing along with the whole

6143feb0-1cc1-4619-93ea-b17e62a584eb-1
01:08:17.818 --> 01:08:23.336
when it's sail and looks like
the fishing boat caught a some

6143feb0-1cc1-4619-93ea-b17e62a584eb-2
01:08:23.336 --> 01:08:24.059
kind of.

f03a7708-9cad-4768-b8ee-3f10c1c9efed-0
01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:30.211
Fishy animal with the long horn
on the middle of his forehead

f03a7708-9cad-4768-b8ee-3f10c1c9efed-1
01:08:30.211 --> 01:08:33.870
and a giant net, and they're
craning him up.

341a288e-02ff-40b5-b10b-529f5bf098dd-0
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:40.537
The fishing boat has some dogs
on it. It's for men. And then

341a288e-02ff-40b5-b10b-529f5bf098dd-1
01:08:40.537 --> 01:08:45.736
the little sail boats still
sailing along into looks like

341a288e-02ff-40b5-b10b-529f5bf098dd-2
01:08:45.736 --> 01:08:51.203
he's getting farther into the
the city and there's people on

341a288e-02ff-40b5-b10b-529f5bf098dd-3
01:08:51.203 --> 01:08:52.100
the docks.

d2906730-03ef-4adf-8b69-779efe2bba23-0
01:08:54.750 --> 01:09:02.208
Then seagulls. OK, so now it
looks like the little paper boat

d2906730-03ef-4adf-8b69-779efe2bba23-1
01:09:02.208 --> 01:09:07.020
sailing into some kind of little
canal.

f1394313-08b8-49f3-a5e5-5f359c427327-0
01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:15.719
Going through the city, there's
some small steamboats sailing.

f1394313-08b8-49f3-a5e5-5f359c427327-1
01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:22.352
On this canal there's flying
creatures, there's buildings and

f1394313-08b8-49f3-a5e5-5f359c427327-2
01:09:22.352 --> 01:09:28.235
windows and lights in the
windows and like overpasses,

f1394313-08b8-49f3-a5e5-5f359c427327-3
01:09:28.235 --> 01:09:31.979
underpasses, he's sailing
through.

625597ef-0afb-45d8-a8cb-aca3c580294e-0
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.280
That's about it, some people.

8100ce50-e8ab-428b-aac0-c07911958804-0
01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:48.302
{OK, now we have 3 pages left. }
OK, so the little paper boats

8100ce50-e8ab-428b-aac0-c07911958804-1
01:09:48.302 --> 01:09:51.000
still sealing along and.

a10f3de5-c5fe-4e4d-aff8-4ddd644571d2-0
01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.756
Sailing through this town.
There's lots of steps in this

a10f3de5-c5fe-4e4d-aff8-4ddd644571d2-1
01:09:56.756 --> 01:10:01.169
town leading from this canal up
and up into the city. And

a10f3de5-c5fe-4e4d-aff8-4ddd644571d2-2
01:10:01.169 --> 01:10:05.886
there's, there's the guy with
the costume and the horn on his

a10f3de5-c5fe-4e4d-aff8-4ddd644571d2-3
01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:10.679
head again, he's riding a horse.
Black and white cats here and

a10f3de5-c5fe-4e4d-aff8-4ddd644571d2-4
01:10:10.679 --> 01:10:15.244
the reindeer and the scuba diver
and a joker and characters

a10f3de5-c5fe-4e4d-aff8-4ddd644571d2-5
01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.070
dressed up and kite and.

2b3dc0d5-bb0b-4976-9c77-5515e7bd0a67-0
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:25.465
Some sea creatures and somebody
smoking a cigarette or

2b3dc0d5-bb0b-4976-9c77-5515e7bd0a67-1
01:10:25.465 --> 01:10:31.440
something. It looks like a scuba
diver because it has the scuba.

a171107f-c8f0-437e-bfd3-baa19a233065-0
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.551
Mask on the ground now, his
helmet, and he's sitting on the

a171107f-c8f0-437e-bfd3-baa19a233065-1
01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:42.633
steps helping out, and there is
more people and more overpasses.

a171107f-c8f0-437e-bfd3-baa19a233065-2
01:10:42.633 --> 01:10:47.247
That's just a little sailboat
sailing past under, I should

a171107f-c8f0-437e-bfd3-baa19a233065-3
01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:47.560
say.

c45b40cb-38ac-4b16-83b0-267c8d649443-0
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:54.274
So the little paper boat is
still sailing. It looks like

c45b40cb-38ac-4b16-83b0-267c8d649443-1
01:10:54.274 --> 01:10:59.205
it's night time. There's some
fish with their eyes glowing,

c45b40cb-38ac-4b16-83b0-267c8d649443-2
01:10:59.205 --> 01:11:03.890
there's stars out in the moon
and street lights are lit.

e492fe0a-5154-4155-a7a0-15dcbfec642b-0
01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.962
Some boats, but everything looks
quiet, like now it's in the

e492fe0a-5154-4155-a7a0-15dcbfec642b-1
01:11:08.962 --> 01:11:10.150
middle of the night.

8f10c160-8d01-4caa-bc99-e4b590b103b5-0
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:20.224
{This is our last page. OK, } so
the little paper boat keeps

8f10c160-8d01-4caa-bc99-e4b590b103b5-1
01:11:20.224 --> 01:11:24.730
sailing and there's a small
little house and.

a6caba45-2245-4377-bff4-a19c45f88f4d-0
01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.454
Looks like the doors open and
the windows are lit. There's a

a6caba45-2245-4377-bff4-a19c45f88f4d-1
01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:35.464
street light lit so it's still
dark and the little sailboat

a6caba45-2245-4377-bff4-a19c45f88f4d-2
01:11:35.464 --> 01:11:40.642
keeps sailing. But now there
appears to be somebody, a person

a6caba45-2245-4377-bff4-a19c45f88f4d-3
01:11:40.642 --> 01:11:45.569
inside the sailboat and this
person gets is faded at first

a6caba45-2245-4377-bff4-a19c45f88f4d-4
01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:47.240
but then it he gets.

0a0fca1f-4ff9-4f2f-b66a-245be2942562-0
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.720
Um.

369e1594-bbfe-4a30-b883-5f5656ebf50b-0
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.137
#END_wanderer He appears more
and more along the boat. He gets

369e1594-bbfe-4a30-b883-5f5656ebf50b-1
01:11:55.137 --> 01:11:59.631
up and he gets out of the boat.
He turns into a full-sized

369e1594-bbfe-4a30-b883-5f5656ebf50b-2
01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:04.581
person and he walks up the steps
and he's in like a black outfit

369e1594-bbfe-4a30-b883-5f5656ebf50b-3
01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:09.531
or costume. There's somebody at
the top of the steps in white it

369e1594-bbfe-4a30-b883-5f5656ebf50b-4
01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:13.720
might be, and he looks like he
goes up to that person.

f673e2f3-460c-4557-be94-48b0c52fed4e-0
01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.070
{All right.

6f042c20-9fd6-4cb5-ab6e-e840e8098e22-0
01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.270
That was the story. That's the
whole story, yes.

dd860c9a-5dae-4a01-ad42-ae886789ed41-0
01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:22.720
OK.

ee27fd82-124c-4f1d-9767-e7e74aecbc74-0
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.480
That's good. Wait, how do I stop
here?

a05a80a4-1f8a-488d-b70e-6383cb6a9013-0
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:31.270
Sure I can do this.

a15d66eb-ccce-40be-bd98-85fa7e94faa4-0
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.350
Initial, OK.

a49919cc-3b29-4af0-be94-71b4a0e2cc4f-0
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:40.150
Cool. Now stop recording.}
