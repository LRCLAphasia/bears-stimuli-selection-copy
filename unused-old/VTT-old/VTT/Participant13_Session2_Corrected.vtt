d856ce17-2e72-4f57-b179-87a172a3f29b-0
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.350
OK. OK. OK. Go ahead and get
started.

97fa13c0-a20f-4706-a64c-7a7d1edcd143-0
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.338
So the first one here,
continuing from last time will

97fa13c0-a20f-4706-a64c-7a7d1edcd143-1
00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:22.191
be a complex scene. So you will
see a busy scene and describe

97fa13c0-a20f-4706-a64c-7a7d1edcd143-2
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.590
what you see and what is
happening.

729550f2-0036-430e-8761-cce3e0244455-0
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.581
In as much detail as you can,
but take between three and five

729550f2-0036-430e-8761-cce3e0244455-1
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:34.304
minutes. As I said, I will let
you know when you hit three

729550f2-0036-430e-8761-cce3e0244455-2
00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:38.405
minutes and if you have more to
say, you can go ahead and finish

729550f2-0036-430e-8761-cce3e0244455-3
00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:38.910
that up.

d1f63e23-e431-4a94-bc1d-8b2c512072d0-0
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.670
Does that sound good?

d621352c-2312-4451-affd-96f632a1812d-0
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.360
Hey.

2aa7fe15-0fda-43d9-94ab-41f460b6b394-0
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.860
OK, you can start when you're
ready.

2898e0ac-29e9-46bf-913f-628d4842c4fd-0
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.250
Whoa.

dbd4c9d3-deaa-4b58-8579-bd4cb120baf4-0
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.370
Yeah, it's a lot.

22822e56-629f-4fe6-a750-42d98bc97d58-0
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.020
Don't.

9d5dbf28-2a31-42d4-bd3f-45b128a00078-0
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.510
It's really hard to see.

8a410111-093f-4c67-b4cc-04ac230fc7e7-0
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.570
#START_ancient_rome OK, this
looks like a gladiators'.

e867943e-e9db-4913-b298-c5644bfa42e1-0
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.580
Area with a big crowd and
apparently.

bb92572b-cdab-4493-8796-abbeffdb9785-0
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.361
Some officials over in one
section of that this must be the

bb92572b-cdab-4493-8796-abbeffdb9785-1
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.020
the head honchos.

bbde2a87-f184-48aa-a67e-f251eb4a5e57-0
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.660
And inside there are a number of
horses, tigers.

c93948ef-3138-4240-bb3c-f610fceff0bb-0
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.480
Ohh.

d639d31e-fa9e-438b-8fe0-f9805abe2d8c-0
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.210
Men with loincloths and.

744ed483-361e-4959-952b-0d65e83ca433-0
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.410
Weapons.

56e21504-f506-4a1f-b97a-2ad44be335d8-0
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.800
Shields.

74e78f98-a419-4494-ad94-c49c771d2862-0
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.393
There's someone in the swimming
pool here. Maybe he's out to

74e78f98-a419-4494-ad94-c49c771d2862-1
00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:50.840
lunch.

f1125d46-8682-4c80-a870-4ae1ac1aa705-0
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.210
There's a group of horses with a
chariot and it seemed to be

f1125d46-8682-4c80-a870-4ae1ac1aa705-1
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.410
dragging somebody behind it.

1b3663bd-517b-4654-bd94-d865e9f399cd-0
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.120
A number of these.

2e0cc181-febc-4bec-aec4-ac6680d5b779-0
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.340
There're general chaos and
mayhem. We've got a group of

2e0cc181-febc-4bec-aec4-ac6680d5b779-1
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.058
lions who are climbing on each
others trying to get into the

2e0cc181-febc-4bec-aec4-ac6680d5b779-2
00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:21.308
stands to possibly eat the
people. {we've got here 2000

2e0cc181-febc-4bec-aec4-ac6680d5b779-3
00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:25.340
years ago. Fun and games in
ancient Rome.}

ef2cea8a-7691-478a-83ee-447e04499fa3-0
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.510
Glad I wasn't there.

9e53c587-2d13-4e9c-a2c6-9a6370b88ec5-0
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.050
Uh.

4cfdc0b5-b5ca-439e-ba51-c16721210783-0
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.089
And I don't see anybody dying or
seeming to be hurt, strangely

4cfdc0b5-b5ca-439e-ba51-c16721210783-1
00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.900
enough.

f382c5ad-ca78-4124-a8c3-997f24762032-0
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.079
People just seem to be
generally. It's hard to tell if

f382c5ad-ca78-4124-a8c3-997f24762032-1
00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.905
they're angry and we've got
somebody sweeping up a fire

f382c5ad-ca78-4124-a8c3-997f24762032-2
00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:57.507
here. It's almost as though this
was common, a common occurrence

f382c5ad-ca78-4124-a8c3-997f24762032-3
00:02:57.507 --> 00:02:58.800
during the day.

02fbf795-6f75-492f-97e4-6f0143019fdf-0
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.510
In this in Rome.

df7dbd82-c55b-41ca-8c2f-a1b71cab9978-0
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.025
As I say, nobody seems to be
sick or or hurt, despite the

df7dbd82-c55b-41ca-8c2f-a1b71cab9978-1
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.910
fact that there is some.

a8b2f125-a018-46fd-abda-5865d8788472-0
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.980
There's just a lot going on,
yeah.

d819e220-fe22-4b42-9926-402a18327bfc-0
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.126
And lions are walking around and
don't seem to be after anybody

d819e220-fe22-4b42-9926-402a18327bfc-1
00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:30.620
eating anybody, so that's oddly.

78624943-66db-46d4-88c6-a2fc7f739c8b-0
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.150
Umm.

35400111-ab14-48f7-ab0e-9343f70cf55f-0
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.842
People are getting along well
together and and creatures are

35400111-ab14-48f7-ab0e-9343f70cf55f-1
00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:41.559
getting along well together,
despite the fact that you one

35400111-ab14-48f7-ab0e-9343f70cf55f-2
00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.890
would think that they'd be
fearsome.

18970173-20d8-4788-9027-6770b6d69bb1-0
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.590
So there's kind of a a
disconnect there.

bb9b8e18-9abe-46d1-ba1c-383ff24b9fe5-0
00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.682
It is an arena, clearly a place
where things are. People come to

bb9b8e18-9abe-46d1-ba1c-383ff24b9fe5-1
00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:07.259
watch things happen. So even
though it appears to be an

bb9b8e18-9abe-46d1-ba1c-383ff24b9fe5-2
00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:11.840
ordinary day for the people
inside the arena.

dd286e88-ae21-4d73-906f-974fce52fafa-0
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.407
It's hard to say what they are,
what's special about what

dd286e88-ae21-4d73-906f-974fce52fafa-1
00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:21.139
they're watching, because it
looks like a very standard kind

dd286e88-ae21-4d73-906f-974fce52fafa-2
00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:21.690
of a day.

6903f470-611f-4a8d-80f0-d6c865c03729-0
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.080
{That's three minutes.}

cdc7ee2e-0d0a-4dae-9397-8fac51c5b17a-0
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.032
We've got a guy here with a
looks like a javelin. I don't

cdc7ee2e-0d0a-4dae-9397-8fac51c5b17a-1
00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:35.573
know where he thinks he's going
to throw it. It's a pitchfork on

cdc7ee2e-0d0a-4dae-9397-8fac51c5b17a-2
00:04:35.573 --> 00:04:39.835
the ground and other people with
pitchforks. So they do have

cdc7ee2e-0d0a-4dae-9397-8fac51c5b17a-3
00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:44.097
implements. I guess. I can't
call them weapons. They must be

cdc7ee2e-0d0a-4dae-9397-8fac51c5b17a-4
00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:48.149
things that they are using to in
an everyday kind of way.

14cd613d-5d1b-43c3-846d-b89f3c912a86-0
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.971
Nobody seems to be particularly
upset and nobody is ganging up

14cd613d-5d1b-43c3-846d-b89f3c912a86-1
00:04:55.971 --> 00:05:01.073
on anybody other than the Lions
who are trying to get into the

14cd613d-5d1b-43c3-846d-b89f3c912a86-2
00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:01.639
stands.

c1ca967b-0915-491a-b26e-45aa5415d500-0
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.580
And that's pretty much it.
#END_ancient_rome OK, great.

081a295a-8f7c-42e0-a2db-37bb6e4cd7b1-0
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.680
So then we can.

2fa0796a-b2d7-4e8d-9f9d-cd9b4005f6aa-0
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.490
Next one it's again a complex
scene.

e5b19e41-d843-4e34-8135-aaf6a1e2d2f1-0
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.310
OK.

058dce4b-f257-4e52-9912-9771e2adad92-0
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.130
#START_waldo_1 This looks like a
city street.

26a28d66-9aa3-4a37-9e66-e4bada1005ba-0
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.026
{Oh, here we are. My name is
Waldo. Let me just look here,

26a28d66-9aa3-4a37-9e66-e4bada1005ba-1
00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:33.860
OK. On a worldwide hike.

de538baa-b8c4-4851-aea6-c46b9a360ca6-0
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.970
We have to find Waldo,
apparently.

d4f3fbe8-3352-4eb5-af0a-2fa4b1bed503-0
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.270
OK, I've got everything I need.

1bd881b4-40d1-4c8e-9eef-fc0de9808682-0
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.104
I'm probably not traveling on my
own. Wherever I go, there are

1bd881b4-40d1-4c8e-9eef-fc0de9808682-1
00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:56.330
lots of other characters. OK,
first find wolf.

d566d7c3-69d3-4d91-9e3b-4defa16ca01c-0
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.087
Well, you can see his tail,
Wenda wizard, white Beard and

d566d7c3-69d3-4d91-9e3b-4defa16ca01c-1
00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:02.890
odlaw, so.

d43cb773-f7bc-4eb1-888e-7ece00fa2407-0
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.460
Then.

d268f13b-5b15-41b3-8d7b-ac79aee02b7b-0
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.530
We're looking for 25 Waldo
watchers. OK, well, first we're

d268f13b-5b15-41b3-8d7b-ac79aee02b7b-1
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.150
looking for a tail.

566f6f44-0bfd-4337-8352-2122a6d1ef88-0
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.920
Goodness.

82456f28-cd9e-48c7-ac8c-e73e98d9be44-0
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.703
Yeah, we can just start
describing the skip that, skip

82456f28-cd9e-48c7-ac8c-e73e98d9be44-1
00:06:23.703 --> 00:06:29.490
that. OK I guess we're looking
for he is on a worldwide hike,

82456f28-cd9e-48c7-ac8c-e73e98d9be44-2
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.970
OK.} In this city Street there
is a roundabout.

6434c450-f066-4f22-b298-2caf08f0be1d-0
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.110
Where people where the direction
of traffic seems to be in One

6434c450-f066-4f22-b298-2caf08f0be1d-1
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.320
Direction clockwise.

fc96cd2c-3f9a-4e79-8e39-beec28913454-0
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.456
And there are places that it
looks like a restaurants here

fc96cd2c-3f9a-4e79-8e39-beec28913454-1
00:06:53.456 --> 00:06:59.678
there are houses person living
in one section for Oh no that's

fc96cd2c-3f9a-4e79-8e39-beec28913454-2
00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:05.999
a gas station. Sorry. So there
are they are and here I see a it

fc96cd2c-3f9a-4e79-8e39-beec28913454-3
00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:09.160
looks like a maybe a fire truck.

bdbed9b9-1c97-4125-831a-8881a747f066-0
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.570
So it's a place where people are
conducting business.

253db660-dfd3-4f35-bed7-f5894ceeabf6-0
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.297
And other places to eat along
the street and the number of

253db660-dfd3-4f35-bed7-f5894ceeabf6-1
00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:24.400
people who are.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.887
Walking around and going places.
We have a scene here where

1a87f169-3c21-46f6-b25c-9bcd2ce318a7-1
00:07:31.887 --> 00:07:32.980
people are.

b2c6ab44-1e93-4bb8-b425-9df4c54aa198-0
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.368
Jousting, looks like, up on top
of a of a building. It looks if

b2c6ab44-1e93-4bb8-b425-9df4c54aa198-1
00:07:39.368 --> 00:07:43.045
they're trying to build a
building, but a couple of people

b2c6ab44-1e93-4bb8-b425-9df4c54aa198-2
00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:44.230
are fooling around.

822d9ab5-dcb7-46ee-a139-5cc7892b8922-0
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.910
Can't tell what they are, mops?

f15eea46-1d2f-42fb-848b-2b40bd402bf3-0
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.110
And they've got some birds up
there.

fe42cfbb-c803-4dbb-b1b0-ca973363f1e4-0
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.970
That's.

473034af-419e-4f7e-8147-d32e4494d108-0
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.530
On the ground.

cb63c5f1-d0c9-4980-a8d7-dc00a48013ad-0
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.390
And birds flying.

ab9f250f-f892-4e58-874b-e70b96c5c127-0
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.770
That's a little bit.

d3030770-fe1a-4ea3-8a03-2fdd7b671680-0
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.690
They don't know what's going on
up there. It's a roof deck.

adda068d-15b4-4da8-a98b-f1799ef1346b-0
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.100
And there are other people up on
roof decks.

a9d24042-ac2f-4ade-a709-b7e20d872130-0
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.220


5a787875-db95-4175-96cb-ac1f88fb875c-0
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.903
And coming out of the third
floor of one building onto the

5a787875-db95-4175-96cb-ac1f88fb875c-1
00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:19.320
roof.

5f0473fd-198d-49a3-93da-50d573174676-0
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.458
So things are happening on every
level. People are hanging out of

5f0473fd-198d-49a3-93da-50d573174676-1
00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:29.080
their windows. Apparently it's
either very hot.

a9c4cd24-d624-4c91-9191-84f85e76ff20-0
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.650
Or.

bde28430-1549-4e87-aa4b-472735b54251-0
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.920
They just want to see what's
going on.

acb0e75d-aea7-4803-9123-40e471efcebe-0
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.026
We have a fountain in the middle
and a guy is gotten himself with

acb0e75d-aea7-4803-9123-40e471efcebe-1
00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:50.174
snorkeling gear on is being
pushed up by the water, the

acb0e75d-aea7-4803-9123-40e471efcebe-2
00:08:50.174 --> 00:08:55.690
pressure of the water, and here
is a statue of some Archer.

00d4c0fb-0275-4595-9473-44262d52be7e-0
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.112
So some warrior from the past,
apparently because these people

00d4c0fb-0275-4595-9473-44262d52be7e-1
00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:03.620
are not, are dressed.

751846d0-f53e-44d3-b135-736b438f4fb5-0
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.840
Fairly much as people might be
today.

3251ceb1-7097-4c95-9e05-550a4da24e10-0
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.360
{OK. That was three minutes, OK.

63f1bef8-7a14-42a3-aa62-e65524bafa15-0
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.320
Ohh.}

4663be32-841e-4187-a3ca-6425077b2e18-0
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.446
Looks as if there are a number
of buildings here that are

4663be32-841e-4187-a3ca-6425077b2e18-1
00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:29.322
similar but different, so people
would be able to find their way.

4663be32-841e-4187-a3ca-6425077b2e18-2
00:09:29.322 --> 00:09:32.846
Here's another it looks like an
apartment house with people

4663be32-841e-4187-a3ca-6425077b2e18-3
00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:33.610
inside of it.

bab7fb3d-c597-49a2-9efb-938e085d38b0-0
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.250
Near and far kind of candy

dee39db9-da74-4482-bcd0-44fa3de08b8a-0
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:48.160
candy colored houses, Blues and
pinks and yellows.

082b1d66-3079-4993-9a76-efa715827c66-0
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.532
Uh, and there are flat roofs and
there are peaked roofs. {I'm a

082b1d66-3079-4993-9a76-efa715827c66-1
00:09:54.532 --> 00:09:59.125
builder, so I notice these
things not having much going on

082b1d66-3079-4993-9a76-efa715827c66-2
00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:03.796
in the actual drawing, but it's
what I notice} looks like a

082b1d66-3079-4993-9a76-efa715827c66-3
00:10:03.796 --> 00:10:06.210
theater here in the foreground.

706a8958-4433-454c-bd0e-17a3b5bb3963-0
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.220
Umm.

cb4bed22-f247-4669-ab23-17761208030b-0
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:15.141
Somebody on a motorcycle making
some noise appears to be. And

cb4bed22-f247-4669-ab23-17761208030b-1
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:19.280
then there's a group down here,
people in the street.

eba16830-631b-4ea3-b8bc-80ea0703698e-0
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.000
Looking up?

e3dc4d3d-2150-40ca-98b0-a4f1b5f0df41-0
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.349
There is a person with a dog.
That's not the dog we're looking

e3dc4d3d-2150-40ca-98b0-a4f1b5f0df41-1
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:32.280
for. Several dogs here greeting
each other too, so it looks like

e3dc4d3d-2150-40ca-98b0-a4f1b5f0df41-2
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.150
an ordinary day in Beantown or
wherever it may be. #END_waldo_1

af7b13b2-db96-4b98-a5b8-b248ff61297b-0
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.124
We're looking for his key. Are
we looking for those things,

af7b13b2-db96-4b98-a5b8-b248ff61297b-1
00:10:50.124 --> 00:10:53.420
cameras and so forth. OK, good,
because see them.

20a20e14-b373-4f3a-a902-45b8a510a541-0
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.220
That was good. That was about 5
minutes, OK.

5b7e05cd-9626-4328-b413-8833403b82fe-0
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.581
OK, so moving on to the next
one. Instead of 1 picture, now

5b7e05cd-9626-4328-b413-8833403b82fe-1
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:11.236
we have several pages that tell
a story. Again, please describe

5b7e05cd-9626-4328-b413-8833403b82fe-2
00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:16.361
what you see and what is
happening, and I'll let you know

5b7e05cd-9626-4328-b413-8833403b82fe-3
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:21.663
when you've taken 10 minutes,
but we're aiming for 10 to 15

5b7e05cd-9626-4328-b413-8833403b82fe-4
00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:22.370
minutes.

4c5bc619-07f6-4db7-94fb-7c9fdcef7b1e-0
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.664
#START_flowerman OK, this looks
like something out of a film

4c5bc619-07f6-4db7-94fb-7c9fdcef7b1e-1
00:11:27.664 --> 00:11:27.930
noir.

86f9ffe0-1c90-4ab1-b046-77d40440f310-0
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.988
Uh, rather mysterious and spooky
and foggy and it's I see it

86f9ffe0-1c90-4ab1-b046-77d40440f310-1
00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:40.648
appears to be night time because
the street lights are on. We

86f9ffe0-1c90-4ab1-b046-77d40440f310-2
00:11:40.648 --> 00:11:45.030
have a lone figure with a dog
crossing a river.

3fb736dd-943b-4c9e-a4b8-68f35bbc8a02-0
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.100
And in that river there is a
car.

aaa4444f-950d-4c04-8ce0-56c980afd66b-0
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.330
Submerged under the water you
can see it, but it's underwater.

1e24708e-2fe2-42cf-ab0e-96a7b669d30c-0
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.580
Hmm.

cfb95bac-e3e6-49f4-ab63-b0dc743b2bee-0
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.950
And.

28d24e65-8747-40dd-9b2f-61e023806a01-0
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.946
The gas station gas station,
which is closed because it is

28d24e65-8747-40dd-9b2f-61e023806a01-1
00:12:07.946 --> 00:12:08.360
night.

6675078f-a2ed-48ed-80b5-17abefe024a9-0
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:15.547
Then on the next page or the
same, it's part of the same

6675078f-a2ed-48ed-80b5-17abefe024a9-1
00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:20.900
picture. You've got a bar here
and all again closed.

cb773410-a649-46ca-91e5-ebff632eca8e-0
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:27.145
A bait shop, so we're somewhere
near a they go fish in this

cb773410-a649-46ca-91e5-ebff632eca8e-1
00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:28.740
river, apparently.

b06e626f-c005-4bf1-9185-db9fd4c0a449-0
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.246
And houses and there aren't any
lights on, so we know that it's

b06e626f-c005-4bf1-9185-db9fd4c0a449-1
00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:41.312
at night and there is a single,
as I say, person crossing this

b06e626f-c005-4bf1-9185-db9fd4c0a449-2
00:12:41.312 --> 00:12:42.760
bridge, the river.

9e12aa86-1377-417e-bc52-26f9bcd6d237-0
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.470
And this person now is.

30beb505-b323-4a6c-ac16-bacedc81b184-0
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.862
Headed for some place, the
houses here are several stories

30beb505-b323-4a6c-ac16-bacedc81b184-1
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:59.290
tall. They appear to be made out
of stone.

373ee5a5-a562-4b47-818b-60c826defce7-0
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.560
Uh, with the impressive
doorways.

5d897840-4264-4205-a8e7-c743a3a013b4-0
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.310
Ohh.

50e332dc-9185-4d29-9bae-629af2f0ea0c-0
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.790
It looks as if there are people
awake on the 2nd floor of one of

50e332dc-9185-4d29-9bae-629af2f0ea0c-1
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.620
the buildings and lights on in
the downstairs of the building.

8bed1fdf-dfa3-41b1-ac2d-a16b387e2c0b-0
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.980
And this.

9890d3f9-7997-4764-b2a5-53e4f41c28eb-0
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.240
There are several people out and
about.

b80b36d5-8572-48d4-860a-1ea5c7a9b8d6-0
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.080
One person looking out on a
patio of his house.

19015111-eced-4459-b17f-3aee01b2bac1-0
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.340
Looking down at the ground,
maybe can't sleep. Other people

19015111-eced-4459-b17f-3aee01b2bac1-1
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.178
who are can be seen in the
windows of their houses. Again,

19015111-eced-4459-b17f-3aee01b2bac1-2
00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:45.426
maybe they're not sleeping, or
maybe they're up early. Here's a

19015111-eced-4459-b17f-3aee01b2bac1-3
00:13:45.426 --> 00:13:50.346
cafe. Maybe those people are.
Maybe the people who have the

19015111-eced-4459-b17f-3aee01b2bac1-4
00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:55.020
cafe also live above it and
maybe getting ready to start

19015111-eced-4459-b17f-3aee01b2bac1-5
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.840
their day.

5c453e33-f357-42dc-9b8b-f716afb52bac-0
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.694
There are stones on the ground.
They're fairly heavy stones as

5c453e33-f357-42dc-9b8b-f716afb52bac-1
00:14:11.694 --> 00:14:13.830
opposed to pea gravel.

ce253ce5-71ac-44ac-b08c-e2119c658a22-0
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.501
But the the street has been
prepared for some something to

ce253ce5-71ac-44ac-b08c-e2119c658a22-1
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:26.154
go over. Apparently cars are are
to be had because we saw one in

ce253ce5-71ac-44ac-b08c-e2119c658a22-2
00:14:26.154 --> 00:14:31.112
the river. The guy over here
looks like Nixon. Ooh, that

ce253ce5-71ac-44ac-b08c-e2119c658a22-3
00:14:31.112 --> 00:14:36.156
bodes badly. OK and here's
another house that looks as if

ce253ce5-71ac-44ac-b08c-e2119c658a22-4
00:14:36.156 --> 00:14:41.810
the there's quite a bit going on
there. There's a hydrant out in

ce253ce5-71ac-44ac-b08c-e2119c658a22-5
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.419
front of it, a little winding
stair. The the canopy.

092f3735-bee5-4543-b18b-b5df4d54a6e3-0
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.221
Makes it look as if it's maybe a
a club of some kind and inside

092f3735-bee5-4543-b18b-b5df4d54a6e3-1
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:54.610
of this house, Brick house.

057c3caa-5d42-40c9-9e84-cd6fb1d18425-0
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.460
Are people who are in stages of
undress.

7ab74038-ca31-43b9-ac1a-d8e131f4eb5d-0
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.110
And.

7ad8727c-5862-4616-826d-4b1363501746-0
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.123
Hard to tell what they might be
doing. Here's somebody in

7ad8727c-5862-4616-826d-4b1363501746-1
00:15:13.123 --> 00:15:17.226
another house who looks to be
maybe playing an instrument.

7ad8727c-5862-4616-826d-4b1363501746-2
00:15:17.226 --> 00:15:21.190
He's got some music on a stand,
I believe. Hard to tell.

2b00796c-76b8-4092-8313-7f0b1313472f-0
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:30.250
And it looks as if there's some
kind of maybe sunrise now.

adb678e5-40ed-4b9b-9ab1-d68008168b33-0
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:37.174
The sky seems to be lightening
somewhat, but the street lights

adb678e5-40ed-4b9b-9ab1-d68008168b33-1
00:15:37.174 --> 00:15:41.276
are still on here. Here's
somebody asleep on the what

adb678e5-40ed-4b9b-9ab1-d68008168b33-2
00:15:41.276 --> 00:15:44.770
looks to be a fountain that is
not operating.

ebf5e10e-ebb1-4891-a280-1bbca474af42-0
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.775
Maybe the fountain has shut down
and this person is lying on the

ebf5e10e-ebb1-4891-a280-1bbca474af42-1
00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:52.260
ledge of the fountain.

01eafe28-b09a-4921-b3a9-2f67ffc58ffa-0
00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:02.207
This man is still walking. He is
the only figure in the drawings

01eafe28-b09a-4921-b3a9-2f67ffc58ffa-1
00:16:02.207 --> 00:16:08.464
who is in color. Got a blue hat
and a yellow suit and a the

01eafe28-b09a-4921-b3a9-2f67ffc58ffa-2
00:16:08.464 --> 00:16:09.090
lease.

ca0d260a-1ff9-442e-b6ea-286bdade31ef-0
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:15.220
OK.

e5bfad0e-f4c5-4b19-ab14-4310681d2b93-0
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.920
All right. Now we have a little
bit more in color.

13315c40-641d-40aa-bf98-2a5bfddfe9c6-0
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.971
This must be this man's house,
so we're apparently going to

13315c40-641d-40aa-bf98-2a5bfddfe9c6-1
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:28.660
focus on that. It has a tree in
it.

6b80a37e-80c8-43e1-a4f0-d18659b542c8-0
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.140
Looks as if, uh, this house is
made of uh has shutters.

ff95e930-b189-471a-bc14-f7a3d1492339-0
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.604
And instead of being a brick
looks as if it might be a frame

ff95e930-b189-471a-bc14-f7a3d1492339-1
00:16:40.604 --> 00:16:45.307
building. He has a looks like a
lawn mower out in the front yard

ff95e930-b189-471a-bc14-f7a3d1492339-2
00:16:45.307 --> 00:16:49.938
and is taking care of his house.
People have come out now their

ff95e930-b189-471a-bc14-f7a3d1492339-3
00:16:49.938 --> 00:16:54.569
houses and they're walking, so
there doesn't look as if there's

ff95e930-b189-471a-bc14-f7a3d1492339-4
00:16:54.569 --> 00:16:58.260
much room for cars here.
Somebody is on a scooter.

b1d55de3-5d96-47c6-b759-8241142c9f7f-0
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:05.910
And other people are walking and
these people are kind of of.

9afe6235-2ac8-4844-87c2-bf2024cee7fc-0
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.040
Loaded.

a69060d4-c3af-4b5c-9caa-90231b80a498-0
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.040
Uh.

fcba7b72-d510-4b81-9c17-8eed13c4bacb-0
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.780
They look like cartoon figures.

46b4ba0a-0e4e-42fd-a8e8-20833cf0f8fa-0
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.416
And with uh odd expressions, so
these women over here on the

46b4ba0a-0e4e-42fd-a8e8-20833cf0f8fa-1
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:25.220
left are looking disapproving
and generally.

4e9af742-54fa-44f7-b5b4-0a1c72b18926-0
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.760
Self absorbed. I would say
they've to be pretty much

4e9af742-54fa-44f7-b5b4-0a1c72b18926-1
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.654
functioning on their own. We've
got a person leaning against the

4e9af742-54fa-44f7-b5b4-0a1c72b18926-2
00:17:37.654 --> 00:17:41.945
door over here, a clock above
it. I don't know what that

4e9af742-54fa-44f7-b5b4-0a1c72b18926-3
00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:46.914
building might be, but there's a
telescope on top of it, so maybe

4e9af742-54fa-44f7-b5b4-0a1c72b18926-4
00:17:46.914 --> 00:17:51.431
it's a place of historical
interest where you can go with a

4e9af742-54fa-44f7-b5b4-0a1c72b18926-5
00:17:51.431 --> 00:17:53.540
roof deck for itself or for.

abfd80ff-51b3-48b1-ac46-52a415708d6d-0
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.867
It looks as if it might be an
office of some kind, or a place

abfd80ff-51b3-48b1-ac46-52a415708d6d-1
00:17:58.867 --> 00:18:01.300
where people might go, rather
than a house.

2a86f018-8267-42cf-9523-7920556a7b71-0
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.414
And then here's a house in the
middle and beginning to see some

2a86f018-8267-42cf-9523-7920556a7b71-1
00:18:07.414 --> 00:18:11.672
of these people. Well, this is
the place where that looked as

2a86f018-8267-42cf-9523-7920556a7b71-2
00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:15.860
if it was kind of busy last
night. And there are some people

2a86f018-8267-42cf-9523-7920556a7b71-3
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.118
hanging out there. Somebody in a
looks like a delivery person

2a86f018-8267-42cf-9523-7920556a7b71-4
00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:23.620
possibly. And now in the
fountain there is a fish.

4e09d1ed-2547-4a8e-a6ea-09f874f87e1f-0
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.550
That looks as if it's a.

3f97ea16-a987-4022-9f4d-d3a7908c40c3-0
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.250
A stone thing that he he's the
fish is going to probably shoot

3f97ea16-a987-4022-9f4d-d3a7908c40c3-1
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.290
some water out of his mouth.

8d4067f5-a536-424d-95e4-73fdf15cfe99-0
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.523
And then we have some other
people sitting on a bench here

8d4067f5-a536-424d-95e4-73fdf15cfe99-1
00:18:41.523 --> 00:18:46.306
in the front and kind of looks
looks like it could be early

8d4067f5-a536-424d-95e4-73fdf15cfe99-2
00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:51.089
version of New York City when
people would sit out on their

8d4067f5-a536-424d-95e4-73fdf15cfe99-3
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.800
Stoops and watch the world go
by.

e1ea039c-ce41-4de5-8347-a9d8431511c4-0
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.010
Hmm.

cbd97d67-1f72-4bd6-a735-22b724e02904-0
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.587
Oh, we've got our man with his
house here, and he is really

cbd97d67-1f72-4bd6-a735-22b724e02904-1
00:19:06.587 --> 00:19:11.741
taking care of things. The tree
has blossomed and has orange and

cbd97d67-1f72-4bd6-a735-22b724e02904-2
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:16.736
yellow leaves, and people now
are looking kind of happy on the

cbd97d67-1f72-4bd6-a735-22b724e02904-3
00:19:16.736 --> 00:19:18.560
street. They're jovial.

d9473fc6-0ee7-4c21-9ee3-26d2d1b8aaf8-0
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.734
Earlier, I guess it was too
early for them to be very happy

d9473fc6-0ee7-4c21-9ee3-26d2d1b8aaf8-1
00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:27.790
about anything. They may have
been trying to work and now the

d9473fc6-0ee7-4c21-9ee3-26d2d1b8aaf8-2
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.780
people who are out and about
here's somebody on a scooter or

d9473fc6-0ee7-4c21-9ee3-26d2d1b8aaf8-3
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.098
look as if they are doing things
that they're enjoying during the

d9473fc6-0ee7-4c21-9ee3-26d2d1b8aaf8-4
00:19:36.098 --> 00:19:36.360
day.

691cacf5-d3e8-4776-a575-5fbc7410764d-0
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.910
We've got.

536d4c5c-4fb8-4697-a74d-c36243fce3cc-0
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.625
People all the way up to the 4th
floor of these buildings there

536d4c5c-4fb8-4697-a74d-c36243fce3cc-1
00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:56.870
seem to be very, very occupied
all of these places. Now it

536d4c5c-4fb8-4697-a74d-c36243fce3cc-2
00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.116
appears that man who is still
has no clothes on. He may be

536d4c5c-4fb8-4697-a74d-c36243fce3cc-3
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:05.649
sitting at a table in this, in
this House, in the center, with

536d4c5c-4fb8-4697-a74d-c36243fce3cc-4
00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:10.183
the place that looked as if it
was maybe a gathering place for

536d4c5c-4fb8-4697-a74d-c36243fce3cc-5
00:20:10.183 --> 00:20:11.910
somewhat sinister types.

e420da24-2d7a-4208-a659-4ee7f26e7aaa-0
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:19.245
Possibly not. Maybe it's a club
where people go, and for savage

e420da24-2d7a-4208-a659-4ee7f26e7aaa-1
00:20:19.245 --> 00:20:20.150
amusement.

a7ecd4d0-0b9e-48cc-86e4-7ba297da66b4-0
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.408
Here is a delivery person at
this other House here with a

a7ecd4d0-0b9e-48cc-86e4-7ba297da66b4-1
00:20:26.408 --> 00:20:30.637
double door, and above that,
somebody who may live there.

a7ecd4d0-0b9e-48cc-86e4-7ba297da66b4-2
00:20:30.637 --> 00:20:35.230
Looks like an artist. He's got a
palette, what appears to be a

a7ecd4d0-0b9e-48cc-86e4-7ba297da66b4-3
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.240
palette. Oh, here's a here's a
vehicle coming through.

031aea72-352f-46cd-8082-cf6fd5970ad7-0
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.555
Uh, over on the right hand side
and we've got a man Hawking what

031aea72-352f-46cd-8082-cf6fd5970ad7-1
00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:46.080
looks to be ice cream.

c62e47dc-24f0-42e6-814d-e43962d0f0c0-0
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.460
Now the fish is.

730dfd9d-bfbc-433c-a5a6-1a55a7ff78f0-0
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.164
Still there, but on the
fountain. But nothing is

730dfd9d-bfbc-433c-a5a6-1a55a7ff78f0-1
00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:55.500
happening with it yet.

92a6731d-2f50-4774-bf1b-dcf290d49fce-0
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:09.000
OK, now the man who has been
taking care of his house and he

92a6731d-2f50-4774-bf1b-dcf290d49fce-1
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.030
is there, things are starting to
get some color as.

1ba9cde6-f84f-4055-9a7a-a130353cd942-0
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.189
People who get Peppier. He has a
visitor here and a couple of

1ba9cde6-f84f-4055-9a7a-a130353cd942-1
00:21:22.189 --> 00:21:26.947
visitors that he's talking with,
and some people in front of his

1ba9cde6-f84f-4055-9a7a-a130353cd942-2
00:21:26.947 --> 00:21:27.680
house are.

63d100ef-c7ff-41a4-a10f-221da6aa9e38-0
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.680
Brought to color.

8a9ed6c3-2b90-468b-b368-b293b1883e7f-0
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.710
Because.

d405f8d7-fd0c-40ae-898a-3757f9c28557-0
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.710
It's showing a lot more life.

1116072b-42c0-4f55-840d-91289a21e95b-0
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:44.197
And of flushing out, if you
will, the way this little

1116072b-42c0-4f55-840d-91289a21e95b-1
00:21:44.197 --> 00:21:45.550
village works.

0356817e-6bea-4726-86c8-15e98ac0e8a1-0
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.450
Movers, yeah.

9315e33f-64c9-40c8-8994-ae6c343bf6de-0
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.118
And shakers, huh? Good. Into
this one house. And the fellow

9315e33f-64c9-40c8-8994-ae6c343bf6de-1
00:21:56.118 --> 00:22:00.767
who I thought was an artist,
hard to tell what he is doing

9315e33f-64c9-40c8-8994-ae6c343bf6de-2
00:22:00.767 --> 00:22:01.240
there.

1f2c8a97-07d8-40a1-8c1c-2cc9d9d7b3de-0
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.443
Where they are and the man with
no clothes on is also beginning

1f2c8a97-07d8-40a1-8c1c-2cc9d9d7b3de-1
00:22:07.443 --> 00:22:12.050
to get some color in him and
more color into the buildings.

1ab7edd7-8b7b-4535-a488-b5088beb3e24-0
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.742
The little boy in the his
looking at the fountain as if

1ab7edd7-8b7b-4535-a488-b5088beb3e24-1
00:22:17.742 --> 00:22:20.530
he's waiting for the water to
come on.

b99327ce-c540-4ac9-aa33-8491c271fa6c-0
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:28.930
Oh.

c28ce2f4-9bf1-4d0f-b7a0-eb08b06214f2-0
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.355
Now we've really got a lot of
color. This is making it look

c28ce2f4-9bf1-4d0f-b7a0-eb08b06214f2-1
00:22:34.355 --> 00:22:36.250
more chaotic, certainly.

d4d97984-0f7a-46b6-a09d-ce942f18d888-0
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.817
And we have a that car has now
come out and is quite a rig,

d4d97984-0f7a-46b6-a09d-ce942f18d888-1
00:22:42.817 --> 00:22:47.745
looks like a convertible, very
flashy car. It can barely get

d4d97984-0f7a-46b6-a09d-ce942f18d888-2
00:22:47.745 --> 00:22:49.280
through the street.

988491d8-05c2-4137-9f63-357b15602ccc-0
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.780
It's not gonna be able to go
very fast.

95fc7941-93a7-4318-a6ef-8a23bd8d3deb-0
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.771
And it appears as if that fish
is beginning to spout some water

95fc7941-93a7-4318-a6ef-8a23bd8d3deb-1
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:04.104
out of it into the fountain.
There seems to be water in the

95fc7941-93a7-4318-a6ef-8a23bd8d3deb-2
00:23:04.104 --> 00:23:08.581
base of the fountain now, so
it's up and running, and life is

95fc7941-93a7-4318-a6ef-8a23bd8d3deb-3
00:23:08.581 --> 00:23:09.519
beginning to.

63c9bfd2-a6b5-4cf6-99c8-7bfa0eeefc06-0
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.363
Happen. Here is a milk truck
coming to the house where the

63c9bfd2-a6b5-4cf6-99c8-7bfa0eeefc06-1
00:23:15.363 --> 00:23:20.367
man has taken care of his house.
He looks as if he's aged quite a

63c9bfd2-a6b5-4cf6-99c8-7bfa0eeefc06-2
00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:24.841
bit, so this may be happening
over quite a period of time.

63c9bfd2-a6b5-4cf6-99c8-7bfa0eeefc06-3
00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:29.239
Looks as if he's got a wife
there and a little girl who I

63c9bfd2-a6b5-4cf6-99c8-7bfa0eeefc06-4
00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:33.864
thought was a visitor but must
be his daughter and then some

63c9bfd2-a6b5-4cf6-99c8-7bfa0eeefc06-5
00:23:33.864 --> 00:23:36.669
boys who looked to be about her
age.

30f4b331-7e52-4393-afb4-afd6ea83eac2-0
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:44.685
Teenagers. Maybe by now. And so
this is a a time capsule I think

30f4b331-7e52-4393-afb4-afd6ea83eac2-1
00:23:44.685 --> 00:23:46.010
of this town.

3baf4880-cb9f-4099-bc36-96937383f062-0
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.409
And we have on this place on the
left with the telescope up

3baf4880-cb9f-4099-bc36-96937383f062-1
00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:57.774
there. And now somebody's put
some flowers out and seems to be

3baf4880-cb9f-4099-bc36-96937383f062-2
00:23:57.774 --> 00:24:03.309
trying to grow things up on the
roof. And it looks like a Garret

3baf4880-cb9f-4099-bc36-96937383f062-3
00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:08.248
below that and a small place.
But people seem to be quite

3baf4880-cb9f-4099-bc36-96937383f062-4
00:24:08.248 --> 00:24:13.101
happy here who we've got a
couple dancing in the street.

3baf4880-cb9f-4099-bc36-96937383f062-5
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.530
Literally dancing in the street.
Yeah. And in that.

efa08396-bd47-4bc8-8b2f-cb8ec64bf5c4-0
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.300
House that looked like a.

028d3dbc-02f2-4920-bd53-c2ae13434403-0
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.850
A brothel or something. The man
now is.

2677b40f-5389-4572-9406-22beea250c45-0
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:31.495
See, I can't tell if he's what
he's got in his hand. He still

2677b40f-5389-4572-9406-22beea250c45-1
00:24:31.495 --> 00:24:35.637
has no clothes on and some
people way up on top top here

2677b40f-5389-4572-9406-22beea250c45-2
00:24:35.637 --> 00:24:37.600
looking out from a balcony.

064ee162-488c-4988-948b-44c09a1bfbe8-0
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.250
So everybody, this this is a
very.

0f8e2208-5726-4738-9b85-a17800e10cfb-0
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.464
There's a lot of going on and a
lot of people living here is

0f8e2208-5726-4738-9b85-a17800e10cfb-1
00:24:48.464 --> 00:24:53.083
really full of people and they
seem to be very happy. They're

0f8e2208-5726-4738-9b85-a17800e10cfb-2
00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:53.679
smiling.

a6d42d84-983a-4cf2-bda4-b7c57255e62f-0
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.100
Mostly men.

13744882-45ac-47ac-9f8a-55966d469ebe-0
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.450
Almost all men, as a matter of
fact. It's strange, isn't it?

7deda1a7-fc3d-4285-898d-a0a0d335a808-0
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.860
Looks like maybe a woman here by
the car with red hair.

8ef30fdf-d177-4237-a780-4cd063f9d2f2-0
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.904
And here's another one over here
on this side. So things are

8ef30fdf-d177-4237-a780-4cd063f9d2f2-1
00:25:16.904 --> 00:25:21.380
happening in this little place
and it looks like quite a happy

8ef30fdf-d177-4237-a780-4cd063f9d2f2-2
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.360
little place with the cola sign,
so it's fairly recent.

ca7b51e4-43dd-46de-968f-f98269dcfc66-0
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.343
In the last century or so, yeah,
ohh OK. It looks as if it's

ca7b51e4-43dd-46de-968f-f98269dcfc66-1
00:25:32.343 --> 00:25:37.876
getting darker in the day. So
the day is going by and the man

ca7b51e4-43dd-46de-968f-f98269dcfc66-2
00:25:37.876 --> 00:25:43.320
in his house with the purple
roof have has gone in, probably

ca7b51e4-43dd-46de-968f-f98269dcfc66-3
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.570
to take a nap.

920ed3a0-a150-4a12-98e5-d08b0cdbd3d5-0
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.566
And other there's another car in
the street there. The tree is

920ed3a0-a150-4a12-98e5-d08b0cdbd3d5-1
00:25:50.566 --> 00:25:54.963
blossoming. Oh, now there's
somebody up here with a

920ed3a0-a150-4a12-98e5-d08b0cdbd3d5-2
00:25:54.963 --> 00:26:00.037
telescope. He looks like some
kind of scientist, maybe with

920ed3a0-a150-4a12-98e5-d08b0cdbd3d5-3
00:26:00.037 --> 00:26:01.390
his white beard.

bf714e07-a238-461e-bc79-f87b4080e037-0
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.760
Then there's another guy up on
the.

c5e5bed2-2600-4ff8-bd3b-082265031970-0
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.250
Up on the House.

30cdeb98-898c-4658-8455-6d1e3b6753d6-0
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.332
uh has moved in there.
Apparently they moved, that

30cdeb98-898c-4658-8455-6d1e3b6753d6-1
00:26:16.332 --> 00:26:21.472
moving van came and somebody has
taken over that place and looks

30cdeb98-898c-4658-8455-6d1e3b6753d6-2
00:26:21.472 --> 00:26:26.454
as if they've renovated it to
some extent where the artist was

30cdeb98-898c-4658-8455-6d1e3b6753d6-3
00:26:26.454 --> 00:26:27.720
or the musician.

d0ceb41a-255a-40dd-8b6f-70e8018cde57-0
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:34.217
The room has been painted red,
yeah, and now we have a number

d0ceb41a-255a-40dd-8b6f-70e8018cde57-1
00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:36.750
of spots of red, red orange.

832958ad-2572-4ae0-91b4-04eb8d732de4-0
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.190
That draw the attention.

02a8a858-7279-4f57-88e0-2f3a2b04e1f1-0
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.890
Fish is now in full force with
his water.

b9dabbc6-4e79-49fc-9e9f-b2e0e006be8b-0
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.950
In the.

fe401dd1-b9c4-4511-b14a-74321be96189-0
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.852
The pool there. And people's
running through the streets, so

fe401dd1-b9c4-4511-b14a-74321be96189-1
00:26:56.852 --> 00:27:01.228
the cars are gone pretty much,
and people are amusing

fe401dd1-b9c4-4511-b14a-74321be96189-2
00:27:01.228 --> 00:27:02.120
themselves.

fc9d187c-ce08-4e01-ad3a-f6f3787075fa-0
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.648
Uh, however they feel they're
laughing and joking and talking

fc9d187c-ce08-4e01-ad3a-f6f3787075fa-1
00:27:07.648 --> 00:27:07.950
and.

16009d6d-833b-4da2-b716-f38e9a3e7c9b-0
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.083
Smiling and everybody seems to
be everything seems to be

16009d6d-833b-4da2-b716-f38e9a3e7c9b-1
00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:18.886
focused now on house, where
maybe the Madam has come out

16009d6d-833b-4da2-b716-f38e9a3e7c9b-2
00:27:18.886 --> 00:27:20.150
onto the steps.

3120a8e6-ec6e-4d09-a593-c95ce01e6979-0
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.740
Fire hydrant is still there.
Anyway, OK.

213031ed-720d-4307-883c-389ce981848c-0
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.062
Now night is falling. There are
people have dwindling, are

213031ed-720d-4307-883c-389ce981848c-1
00:27:39.062 --> 00:27:44.397
dwindling on the streets. People
seem to be in their houses, and

213031ed-720d-4307-883c-389ce981848c-2
00:27:44.397 --> 00:27:44.890
maybe.

348284fe-9d31-46e0-914c-f487166307e3-0
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.880
Not quite as.

4dbdac5c-310a-4967-8ebc-96fd01219324-0
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.180
Chaotic and convivial, whatever.

143c8501-4c2f-4b92-8188-00b0ca053493-0
00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.900
But still happy. Here's a group
out on their back patio.

d4f35e4b-4146-4317-88c4-bc096bcc25c8-0
00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.180
And uh.

f2acb43c-133f-47b6-882b-e0ca34b6513d-0
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.430
This is just another view of the
place this is.

d97e704b-ee7b-4473-87bd-c45aef44c5c9-0
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:14.196
Ah, here we have this is a. It
turns out to be a horse with a

d97e704b-ee7b-4473-87bd-c45aef44c5c9-1
00:28:14.196 --> 00:28:18.985
rider on it. Maybe this is a
different, probably a different

d97e704b-ee7b-4473-87bd-c45aef44c5c9-2
00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:19.770
pool pond.

e3a25661-9454-42c0-b809-d21600865c3c-0
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.745
Fountain in the middle of the
street. So this is a different

e3a25661-9454-42c0-b809-d21600865c3c-1
00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:26.870
part of the city.

e212521a-c8d8-46af-8c6d-af953f8f0c1a-0
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.830
Little bit more.

8cef28bf-5d5b-47f4-bfa5-a0c270d5e627-0
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:40.098
uh stores and commercial. The
others seem to be more where

8cef28bf-5d5b-47f4-bfa5-a0c270d5e627-1
00:28:40.098 --> 00:28:43.240
people were living. This has got
a.

194ad594-58cb-4469-b30c-d3da4eaacc44-0
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.230
Can't read it. Maybe it's a
cafe.

aa95fbbe-1550-4abf-a56e-ac1e7a9b2e4d-0
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.690
Yeah, over here.

7aaa9a58-ad74-4724-b88c-d2c1cb5d0d8d-0
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.340
Turn on the street lights are
on, so it's be it's coming on

7aaa9a58-ad74-4724-b88c-d2c1cb5d0d8d-1
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.640
toward dinner time. That's
probably people are eating.

bd19e54c-f2a6-4eff-b1d3-2e20a961f75c-0
00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.230
OK.

95a4164c-8190-4b90-a1d6-01e4c2234e33-0
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.970
And night is falling, and we are
returning to the darkness.

7b6e4a1e-9fc2-4f0d-97e1-6e35f4384b07-0
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.316
Uh, somebody is here in the
fountain who it looks a little

7b6e4a1e-9fc2-4f0d-97e1-6e35f4384b07-1
00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:17.717
down and out and there's no
water in it. He's got a dog. Was

7b6e4a1e-9fc2-4f0d-97e1-6e35f4384b07-2
00:29:17.717 --> 00:29:20.170
probably not his dog. The dog
is.

726bd27d-8059-4a7e-96a8-e4b36f612492-0
00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.854
Wandering in the street I would
say, and here's our man again

726bd27d-8059-4a7e-96a8-e4b36f612492-1
00:29:25.854 --> 00:29:31.043
who was still in color. He is so
he is weathered the thing and is

726bd27d-8059-4a7e-96a8-e4b36f612492-2
00:29:31.043 --> 00:29:35.446
still very happy. He's got
something in his hand, looks

726bd27d-8059-4a7e-96a8-e4b36f612492-3
00:29:35.446 --> 00:29:36.940
like maybe a light.

e80a2a10-302a-477b-8f2e-447e32115086-0
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:43.243
can't tell exactly. And people
are in where he is, or seem to

e80a2a10-302a-477b-8f2e-447e32115086-1
00:29:43.243 --> 00:29:44.770
be happy to see him.

c607d4d2-6f6e-4e53-80c7-e1ee3fd2f38d-0
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.050
He's come to visit them.

eb3fb2f5-1e9d-46ec-8d1e-61babd69f024-0
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:57.512
And here is somebody who's
offering him a flower. And he is

eb3fb2f5-1e9d-46ec-8d1e-61babd69f024-1
00:29:57.512 --> 00:30:03.478
the one in the House that has
the flowers on the top. And he's

eb3fb2f5-1e9d-46ec-8d1e-61babd69f024-2
00:30:03.478 --> 00:30:09.349
gone by. Oh no he's given her
the flower, as there as he goes

eb3fb2f5-1e9d-46ec-8d1e-61babd69f024-3
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:15.221
by and he's got a dog with him,
for the dog has taken up with

eb3fb2f5-1e9d-46ec-8d1e-61babd69f024-4
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:15.600
him.

2570a701-37a1-44b1-8372-6cdf7ec8cc0c-0
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:21.214
Uh, and he's gone by and he's
given a flower to this little

2570a701-37a1-44b1-8372-6cdf7ec8cc0c-1
00:30:21.214 --> 00:30:25.508
girl who's come out of the
house, and her father has a

2570a701-37a1-44b1-8372-6cdf7ec8cc0c-2
00:30:25.508 --> 00:30:29.100
flower too, so he's given them
each a flower.

2cde7365-a72d-481b-b8c8-b71d2ceed424-0
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:34.570
And then we had they're happy to
have seen him. #END_flowerman

2cde7365-a72d-481b-b8c8-b71d2ceed424-1
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.140
OK, that was the story.

fec14f55-665a-41f2-b4a9-b305ffe66a93-0
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.950
So then.

0b3a174f-4179-4a93-a4ef-6b1290710b47-0
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.139
I realize it would be more
helpful if I let you know also

0b3a174f-4179-4a93-a4ef-6b1290710b47-1
00:30:43.139 --> 00:30:47.545
the pages of the story, so that
with the time and the total

0b3a174f-4179-4a93-a4ef-6b1290710b47-2
00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:50.409
pages you might be easier to
estimate.

3bab56f4-d08c-445e-b6af-007e1b0c9338-0
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:56.428
Yes. I have no idea what time
I'm supposed to be using. OK,

3bab56f4-d08c-445e-b6af-007e1b0c9338-1
00:30:56.428 --> 00:31:01.076
yeah. So then next time I will
let you know the number of pages

3bab56f4-d08c-445e-b6af-007e1b0c9338-2
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:01.440
that.

a72e8de1-7398-46c8-a85a-b1cdb7b54a7a-0
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.490
It would take for you to do.

b581b0f6-5afb-48a4-8731-c54178a37bdc-0
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:10.269
Then for the single pages it
will always be 3 to 5 minutes.

b581b0f6-5afb-48a4-8731-c54178a37bdc-1
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.820
OK, OK.

9a14b9d3-4b1e-4f6e-b0d6-7ff26f2c8835-0
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.450
So I'm going to the next one is
a one page complex scene.

3ead2a81-75fb-4eac-8020-4f73616091fb-0
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.880
So we'll go from there.

7ef54d33-1e3d-44c4-a129-09b2119ab80a-0
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.136
So this is a one complex scene.
One page complex scene. Um, you

7ef54d33-1e3d-44c4-a129-09b2119ab80a-1
00:31:39.136 --> 00:31:43.445
can start whenever you're ready.
I'll let you know when it's 3

7ef54d33-1e3d-44c4-a129-09b2119ab80a-2
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:44.950
minutes, but you have.

2637e737-c923-4cdd-8f8d-4ac5dee2b499-0
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.330
Up to around 5 minutes to finish
everything.

1660266e-e5d7-4a3c-8922-f0e62d00a379-0
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.285
You want me to start? Whenever
you're ready.

1660266e-e5d7-4a3c-8922-f0e62d00a379-1
00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:04.320
#START_deep_sea_divers OK. This
is the deep sea divers. Wow.

7a6351fd-9818-4f55-8ef0-2635026b7b62-0
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.250
And there are a lot of boats up
on top of the water.

4a32a675-78d2-4b5d-941f-292f6dc864eb-0
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.920
They all are fishing for.

9d619e18-137c-4099-8049-e2f80628faef-0
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:21.697
The deep sea divers are down on
the bottom of the floor along

9d619e18-137c-4099-8049-e2f80628faef-1
00:32:21.697 --> 00:32:27.481
with some fish, some kind of
mean looking fish and octopus

9d619e18-137c-4099-8049-e2f80628faef-2
00:32:27.481 --> 00:32:28.560
down there.

94db68c6-5ff8-4266-bcfd-4022b02ec397-0
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.440
Uh.

870074d9-ed8e-42ba-a392-04a5c5c1320d-0
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.226
There's a hand that looks like
it's growing on the on the

870074d9-ed8e-42ba-a392-04a5c5c1320d-1
00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:37.790
bottom.

40585714-1400-41b1-8e1c-065d44babd03-0
00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.930
And here are a number of fish
that are making a face.

7528bafa-371c-454a-b213-e94f3776d946-0
00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:50.628
Red fish the outline of the face
with a couple of eyes, nose and

7528bafa-371c-454a-b213-e94f3776d946-1
00:32:50.628 --> 00:32:51.250
a mouth.

f28ddbac-e33f-4074-b7bd-56ae05a4e75f-0
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.140
Um, there are fish in.

9ca8f6bc-bab8-4a87-a52b-f7fd72d90933-0
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:02.210
Formation of arrows there are
there there are fish in

9ca8f6bc-bab8-4a87-a52b-f7fd72d90933-1
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.840
formation of a fish.

5c1ede1e-7150-487c-8097-9ea23ebb43b6-0
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:12.546
The deep sea divers are anywhere
from the very bottom to the very

5c1ede1e-7150-487c-8097-9ea23ebb43b6-1
00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:17.102
top. There's many people are
swimming around in the in the

5c1ede1e-7150-487c-8097-9ea23ebb43b6-2
00:33:17.102 --> 00:33:21.890
water, so they're on the top of
the water all the way down to

5c1ede1e-7150-487c-8097-9ea23ebb43b6-3
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:22.740
the bottom.

125c9782-a595-479e-9abb-30502bd5aa53-0
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.760
And they and the fish are
intermingling.

c0a4a26b-eee7-43c0-a015-15e48dd6b859-0
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.839
The deep sea divers have
harpoons. What looked to be

c0a4a26b-eee7-43c0-a015-15e48dd6b859-1
00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:38.297
harpoons, though I don't see
anybody right now who has

c0a4a26b-eee7-43c0-a015-15e48dd6b859-2
00:33:38.297 --> 00:33:44.351
speared, for example, a fish.
There probably are some, but I

c0a4a26b-eee7-43c0-a015-15e48dd6b859-3
00:33:44.351 --> 00:33:45.840
can't see them.

dc744e90-b57f-4cdf-86c9-4d5298511e06-0
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.480
Here is a what looks like a
Tarpon.

6cea8fd6-7971-4b31-9b3d-0aafea8a13f6-0
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.337
The long snout, who does not
appear to be threatening the

6cea8fd6-7971-4b31-9b3d-0aafea8a13f6-1
00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:03.151
divers who are coming right at
him. I mean, they're, they're

6cea8fd6-7971-4b31-9b3d-0aafea8a13f6-2
00:34:03.151 --> 00:34:04.730
trying to touch his.

c876a04a-8ee2-462f-bbaf-d26d215ac10e-0
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.850
nose rather than being fleeing.

875930e3-3de1-4588-ad5f-03ede402cbb0-0
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.700
Uh, and here's somebody. Here's
a fish with a net.

4126cd1e-042d-4284-9e4f-8c307e9b1e48-0
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:23.120
So they are interchangeable in
their roles, fish and fishermen.

02338104-1159-4b18-8b25-376514d4e78d-0
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:32.550
People on the top in the boats
who seem to be somebody has one

02338104-1159-4b18-8b25-376514d4e78d-1
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:37.508
of the divers has gone left his
boat. Apparently there's a boat

02338104-1159-4b18-8b25-376514d4e78d-2
00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:42.466
with nobody in it seems to be.
And others there are fishing off

02338104-1159-4b18-8b25-376514d4e78d-3
00:34:42.466 --> 00:34:46.340
of the rocks that are not
submerged in the water.

5d348035-9c02-4657-bea9-bcef4f7006d5-0
00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:48.130
And.

05932cea-1180-4899-9e7b-ff84ab8a552a-0
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.860
Catching something can't tell if
it's a diver or a fish.

2731762c-3cb3-48ab-b7aa-40ba2be40b78-0
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:54.910
Uh.

f47c2708-adaf-410b-8923-85ce78a94839-0
00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.607
There is a boat with a sail on
it. The other boats seem to be

f47c2708-adaf-410b-8923-85ce78a94839-1
00:35:00.607 --> 00:35:05.040
pretty much self-propelled, or
with oars I should say.

246a6a23-995d-46d4-b061-06352c907f31-0
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.980
{That's three minutes.

45cc533d-c2f4-4cef-acce-ca39801d51bc-0
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.455
What's that? That was three
minutes.} OK, here's a great big

45cc533d-c2f4-4cef-acce-ca39801d51bc-1
00:35:14.455 --> 00:35:18.813
fish with a big mouth who is
maybe about to swallow one of

45cc533d-c2f4-4cef-acce-ca39801d51bc-2
00:35:18.813 --> 00:35:23.245
the divers. It looks like that,
but he's practically at the

45cc533d-c2f4-4cef-acce-ca39801d51bc-3
00:35:23.245 --> 00:35:25.240
water The top of the water.

7586798b-9841-4784-a159-094950c3414a-0
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.645
Maybe he is some form of whale
would even look at all like a

7586798b-9841-4784-a159-094950c3414a-1
00:35:30.645 --> 00:35:32.190
whale, but he might be.

1d48a4f9-72df-4460-a438-7a7e73cc043c-0
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.370
taking that role.

03137d6d-cee9-4443-8715-8c8b5ab2374f-0
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.110
Here's a bunch of jellyfish.

17f98a74-82e7-4777-ae88-1d5629a3d6b8-0
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.488
It's about everything that could
be here, which doesn't make a

17f98a74-82e7-4777-ae88-1d5629a3d6b8-1
00:35:43.488 --> 00:35:46.963
lot of sense because I don't
think that a lot of these fish

17f98a74-82e7-4777-ae88-1d5629a3d6b8-2
00:35:46.963 --> 00:35:48.989
live that way, but what do I
know?

431d9bcc-db14-4ed1-9c73-91336b33d49e-0
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.500
Here's a it looks like a a chest
down at the very bottom.

a2dab99d-5c0d-48b5-a804-3b7faf78433a-0
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.305
With some somebody in it, a
fish. A fish is in the chest.

a2dab99d-5c0d-48b5-a804-3b7faf78433a-1
00:36:01.305 --> 00:36:05.555
Somebody, one of the divers has
opened that to find a fish in

a2dab99d-5c0d-48b5-a804-3b7faf78433a-2
00:36:05.555 --> 00:36:08.159
there. That must be his hiding
place.

b102658c-a42a-48b6-8f76-ddab14179d7b-0
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.420
The fair the boats are all have
stripes on them.

89fb6f09-2658-4935-bbc3-b3a78f835221-0
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:18.320
Hmm.

089c2d0a-ec7a-4697-9d38-fdc8c5166fdb-0
00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.530
Something you don't see in real
life. Nope.

cfad9f28-46c0-4dbd-bfae-662f76ea5f80-0
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.397
There's a fish here, looks like
a lion. I guess there is such

cfad9f28-46c0-4dbd-bfae-662f76ea5f80-1
00:36:35.397 --> 00:36:38.573
thing as a lion dish, but the
lion doesn't look like that.

cfad9f28-46c0-4dbd-bfae-662f76ea5f80-2
00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:39.649
#END_deep_sea_divers

0ea2be3e-06d1-458b-a853-3975c8073899-0
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:46.330
OK.

69934b98-8f58-4cbe-881b-1c5b89e1819f-0
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:56.611
Anything else you want to say
about this scene? No, no. OK,

69934b98-8f58-4cbe-881b-1c5b89e1819f-1
00:36:56.611 --> 00:36:57.660
cool. Good.

ddae9df3-f29d-4574-b2ac-d5671b057e76-0
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.100
This one is also a complex
scene.

8e8c6784-3de0-4719-a8b6-36be1cbb34bc-0
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:09.400
Yeah. Do you need need to take a
minute to because we've been

8e8c6784-3de0-4719-a8b6-36be1cbb34bc-1
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.119
through a lot of items. How are
you doing? I'm. I'm OK. OK,

8e8c6784-3de0-4719-a8b6-36be1cbb34bc-2
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:20.458
we'll take a break after two
more. OK. Can I get done a

8e8c6784-3de0-4719-a8b6-36be1cbb34bc-3
00:37:20.458 --> 00:37:22.460
little bit before 12?

8d7d9970-3061-49e0-ad4f-e62e40b8f1c0-0
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.555
OK, good. I've got a class at
12:30 and I've got to have

8d7d9970-3061-49e0-ad4f-e62e40b8f1c0-1
00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:32.600
breakfast before I go to leave.
OK, sounds good.

e5ce1528-a395-4b64-a254-128ec39a5a8f-0
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.040
OK, so.

9e499d04-417b-4282-ae21-86bcd0e2a89a-0
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.610
Again, just start when you're
ready.

6b9d01b5-e945-4d63-a532-0f2635a13ec5-0
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.830
#START_campsite OK.

fbd10288-b74a-491d-ba3f-6819caa8744b-0
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.530
This is.

0d193d03-5b0a-429d-bbae-8887d6162ff6-0
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.200
A campground.

52bf7441-f86c-46ca-afb3-3ff18c93255e-0
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.790
RV's.

97dda2a8-481e-4a05-bc8c-b96abc97c236-0
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:04.311
And tents. There's areas for the
tents and area for the RV's and

97dda2a8-481e-4a05-bc8c-b96abc97c236-1
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:08.240
a canal going down the center of
it.

615adbb5-a703-4170-bd6e-806f002b9466-0
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:15.740
With a ferry boat and people on
it who look to be bodybuilders.

e285e3d1-397d-4db2-9019-e5c46ee4536d-0
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:24.015
Fish in here and people fishing
along the side of the canal.

e285e3d1-397d-4db2-9019-e5c46ee4536d-1
00:38:24.015 --> 00:38:31.102
There is a bridge over the canal
to from the area of the tents.

e285e3d1-397d-4db2-9019-e5c46ee4536d-2
00:38:31.102 --> 00:38:33.760
There's also an area of.

7e953bf7-03b2-4565-b420-a721ffd0e321-0
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.886
Bulls. I guess those are bulls
and what it looks like, people

7e953bf7-03b2-4565-b420-a721ffd0e321-1
00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:47.074
who may be thinking of fighting
them. Boy, that's hard to say.

7e953bf7-03b2-4565-b420-a721ffd0e321-2
00:38:47.074 --> 00:38:52.262
That looks like just a cow on
this one. And people are looking

7e953bf7-03b2-4565-b420-a721ffd0e321-3
00:38:52.262 --> 00:38:57.286
at them. They're not looking as
adversarial at all. So maybe

7e953bf7-03b2-4565-b420-a721ffd0e321-4
00:38:57.286 --> 00:38:58.110
those are.

158a744f-af7d-42b7-974f-e92b1c710223-0
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.730
Livestock. Why they are they
there, but they are.

d4daff95-146d-4d4c-9946-2730c2572aa9-0
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:09.069
And then we have some people who
are crawling. These must be

d4daff95-146d-4d4c-9946-2730c2572aa9-1
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:13.689
prisoners. No, they've got
backpacks on and they're

d4daff95-146d-4d4c-9946-2730c2572aa9-2
00:39:13.689 --> 00:39:16.000
crawling along the ground.

265a1cad-e9e6-4097-b0f0-8132a27e3180-0
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.550
In one section.

b9de03a5-8cff-47b8-b521-abefcfd819a2-0
00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.750
Why?

944b2d56-301d-4dca-ad27-68ed4aaf4df2-0
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:24.670
Hard to say.

192ac95c-e8bf-4b6d-8068-8b254f2d33a7-0
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.140
The people are going over the
bridge, looking down the canal.

192ac95c-e8bf-4b6d-8068-8b254f2d33a7-1
00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:34.400
Here's a there are some animals.
There's a dog, a person on a

192ac95c-e8bf-4b6d-8068-8b254f2d33a7-2
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:34.950
bicycle.

63f70f7b-a3f8-4ad2-a034-f7dc359328d3-0
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:44.487
So it's a day of when people are
out amusing themselves in the in

63f70f7b-a3f8-4ad2-a034-f7dc359328d3-1
00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:46.680
this camping area.

705b4e50-f14a-4b3f-8f95-1cb55a893917-0
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:53.534
Here it looks like a bunch of
scouts. Boy Scouts on one side

705b4e50-f14a-4b3f-8f95-1cb55a893917-1
00:39:53.534 --> 00:39:58.901
who are maybe getting a badge
for something they're lying

705b4e50-f14a-4b3f-8f95-1cb55a893917-2
00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:00.659
around or saluting.

4215710e-2216-437a-a789-332a20a7cb5b-0
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.380
Uh.

ab491fab-dcb9-4c59-b3cc-ad777ffcf354-0
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.575
As I say there are fish in this
river and for whatever reason

ab491fab-dcb9-4c59-b3cc-ad777ffcf354-1
00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:13.170
they are have their heads out of
the water.

7759125b-09e7-4994-bd99-ebbfec639a57-0
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:21.450
There's a bunch of hikers here
with Staffs or walking sticks.

8f2d5a7c-5a19-4e88-95de-ece03219314f-0
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:26.190
One of the tents has collapsed.

03c95300-0d82-4aca-ad45-cfe7a1c9ba5d-0
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.010
Looks as if.

43d16ebb-e73b-47ab-b1e2-7a99faa88e76-0
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.822
On people, although maybe
they've done it deliberately,

43d16ebb-e73b-47ab-b1e2-7a99faa88e76-1
00:40:31.822 --> 00:40:34.969
they probably have because
they're not. Don't seem to be

43d16ebb-e73b-47ab-b1e2-7a99faa88e76-2
00:40:34.969 --> 00:40:38.503
upset about it. The people who
are near the tent, maybe they're

43d16ebb-e73b-47ab-b1e2-7a99faa88e76-3
00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:40.050
just getting ready to leave.

9051d9b3-3c47-410f-af7e-9a6d2e6e4125-0
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:46.440
Here's another one of the dog
and some people with a teepee.

8890563f-1101-43f9-8248-507795cf24fd-0
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.140
Four are relaxing outside of
that.

70ca1613-9ab9-4057-a6c8-442a615905cd-0
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:57.009
And here's a family with six
children and another group near

70ca1613-9ab9-4057-a6c8-442a615905cd-1
00:40:57.009 --> 00:41:02.600
their tent. They're just out
there relaxing on chairs.

f398a0e7-7569-4a51-a365-824ddbf6ebf3-0
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.020
Umm.

d366aeb7-6a1e-4dae-b503-123a96e02675-0
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:14.061
They look like scouts uh some of
these campers, the way they're

d366aeb7-6a1e-4dae-b503-123a96e02675-1
00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:18.450
dressed, so maybe there's some
kind of.

40e3a3a0-cf98-48c9-b093-b750d4f05998-0
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.270
They're looking to to improve
their camping skills maybe.

fa13a256-f736-4ffd-ba62-cbb284e8119a-0
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:32.214
Here is a group of people with
bicycles and a unison, a

fa13a256-f736-4ffd-ba62-cbb284e8119a-1
00:41:32.214 --> 00:41:37.529
unicycle or whatever you call
that, with the top with the high

fa13a256-f736-4ffd-ba62-cbb284e8119a-2
00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:42.001
wheel over outside, walking on
the street beyond the

fa13a256-f736-4ffd-ba62-cbb284e8119a-3
00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:44.870
campground, the area of the
RV's.

f4cc7e5e-57c9-40b9-abfa-a778a2413106-0
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.860
And beyond that is appear to be
fields.

da6f4106-de25-4880-81e7-a0e31c457e77-0
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.660
And some people out in the
fields, but.

696587a3-9450-4232-8df4-c046e0376c90-0
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.420
Generally it's a campground, a
meeting place for.

fc333b71-086b-427a-bfbd-35dee428860d-0
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.580
People who are interested in
that kind of thing.

be5fa289-a775-40b8-94cf-f2e02cd82b0b-0
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.260
{OK, that was 4 minutes.

d63b4ede-cdb3-4b57-b164-4ed98819a277-0
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:12.320
OK.}

40b74668-b5bd-490c-b161-3860358693bc-0
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:22.276
We have a bunch of hikers here
with their Staffs over on this

40b74668-b5bd-490c-b161-3860358693bc-1
00:42:22.276 --> 00:42:25.570
side that are near oh, here's a
guy with a whip.

f8e6b41c-c189-4f5d-b69c-14bfb5bc3990-0
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.140
All of these people are are
crawling along them and that's

f8e6b41c-c189-4f5d-b69c-14bfb5bc3990-1
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.040
that's difficult to say what's
going on there.

13616a1f-cb32-4cd2-9f10-b0de2e45a511-0
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.207
Because nobody is doing anything
about it. It doesn't appear that

13616a1f-cb32-4cd2-9f10-b0de2e45a511-1
00:42:39.207 --> 00:42:43.133
he anybody is hurting anyone.
But it's hard to speculate why

13616a1f-cb32-4cd2-9f10-b0de2e45a511-2
00:42:43.133 --> 00:42:46.930
that would be happening, why
these people are crawling and

13616a1f-cb32-4cd2-9f10-b0de2e45a511-3
00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.990
they look as if they're in pain.

6e16e9f6-f33d-410c-a3eb-0254aab72b77-0
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:50.840
Some of them.

74ca92d2-bf04-4835-9416-81d2d0ea0db1-0
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:53.990
Yeah.

731ad9a9-a4ed-4dc7-a46e-83cbd34465e5-0
00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.490
That's inscrutable.

17fcf38e-7b0c-4a51-8bcf-ad8ed3aed52d-0
00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.280
And then some of them are going
into.

30022030-d5ef-407f-b3ea-fb5ddc1ff42e-0
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:04.190
Looks like a.

00b2f224-ba27-4b17-9e6f-9aed4f8ec6b2-0
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.790
Maybe a jail?

e853df30-da53-49a9-8911-a908b8b4a00d-0
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.870
I I don't know. It's.

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.120
Difficult to tell. #END_campsite

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:26.240
OK, so now let's take a break
and we'll come back at um.

7ec95b1e-f3fe-4e52-835c-0734560554a3-0
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:36.527
OK. Moving on to the next item,
this is a story and you will see

7ec95b1e-f3fe-4e52-835c-0734560554a3-1
00:43:36.527 --> 00:43:37.580

15 minutes.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:48.765
For those six sites, it's a
story. Go through what you see

d1c69a1e-95c4-4fee-9e1d-dd50ef2a6909-1
00:43:48.765 --> 00:43:50.740
and what is happening.

16a974c0-5347-43e9-9b5e-e7e4ba61e3a2-0
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:52.710
OK.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:32.750


ceb2ef92-138b-4ac0-ab41-31730257750e-0
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:52.750


70e84a18-9d8a-4720-b576-d977165ec6bd-0
00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:53.170
#START_arrival_6 It's.

c6cb1a50-e8a4-448e-a9c9-51e563a668c6-0
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.919
It looks as if there is some
kind of a creature getting into

c6cb1a50-e8a4-448e-a9c9-51e563a668c6-1
00:45:11.919 --> 00:45:12.260
this.

ce045e77-b37b-47d1-937c-41cb1921be86-0
00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:14.680
A little pot.

42827aa4-e3c5-4b6c-afc1-5e30376fcdff-0
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.380
On the.

39ed36d7-50a8-45d0-bbca-6311be6c4da6-0
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:24.780
Shelf where a man is writing a
letter and folding it up and

39ed36d7-50a8-45d0-bbca-6311be6c4da6-1
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.440
making it into a flying object,
a bird.

67ebe34e-526f-4cb8-850a-d3e4290e9dce-0
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.490
Um.

cbbfab25-1c83-4bd7-a63e-ab6ff7e0582d-0
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.596
Origami type thing and putting
it into an envelope along with

cbbfab25-1c83-4bd7-a63e-ab6ff7e0582d-1
00:45:36.596 --> 00:45:37.480
some money.

0ddbfcbd-1147-4a03-bded-14116e2665bc-0
00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.760
Sealing it up.

67f4be6c-24b4-430c-9f41-aea90cb469cd-0
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.449
I see. Oh, here we are. OK now
the man has dressed and has

67f4be6c-24b4-430c-9f41-aea90cb469cd-1
00:45:45.449 --> 00:45:46.300
taken this.

f39cfa22-e551-4c99-8754-57c210126956-0
00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.160
With him he is.

2a80d3ef-21e7-4678-92be-e5ae06db6780-0
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.830
Got a

99fafa4b-a78d-4062-a034-47dc6342ba15-0
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:57.760
a creature with him that he's
looks like a giant mouse.

79ee9c5a-0340-4777-95ea-66883a680d0b-0
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:05.240
And he is asking directions from
a woman who has.

d1573e25-9c27-4ee0-a15f-c7845df0d9c2-0
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:10.321
A cat in a basket? I think
that's a cat. At least the tail

d1573e25-9c27-4ee0-a15f-c7845df0d9c2-1
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:13.060
looks like one, unless it's her
tail.

60b615d6-917f-4738-ab0b-7acb31da5fb8-0
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.362
Anyway, he goes to a post office
box and mails his letter, looks

60b615d6-917f-4738-ab0b-7acb31da5fb8-1
00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:22.500
up at the sky.

d7992f1a-0308-4843-8f15-7d6bffce7b1f-0
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.672
And I see and this box is
connected to a balloon. So his

d7992f1a-0308-4843-8f15-7d6bffce7b1f-1
00:46:27.672 --> 00:46:31.830
letter is going off in a
balloon, is being carried away

d7992f1a-0308-4843-8f15-7d6bffce7b1f-2
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:35.320
in a balloon and he is walking
along with his.

cfe50c2b-f814-4778-8c1c-21b5373c9813-0
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.120
Giant mouse.

79607484-6db9-4438-8ee3-4e395ea8a37c-0
00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:55.260
And this looks like the lifespan
of four different.

3e0d2ef4-96dc-4525-a5e9-01080060a3c4-0
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.340
Species of a plant.

a559f3f3-4136-49b1-898b-7645f224678d-0
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:08.331
First one is a leaf. It's in the
ground. It rains on it and it

a559f3f3-4136-49b1-898b-7645f224678d-1
00:47:08.331 --> 00:47:15.028
splits it, and it has a center
that comes out that blossoms, if

a559f3f3-4136-49b1-898b-7645f224678d-2
00:47:15.028 --> 00:47:15.970
you will.

85df0905-2896-437d-8dff-d21e5fc9b81a-0
00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:21.500
The other and next one is a.

998fb3de-096b-43e4-87c4-039510dfafb0-0
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:29.078
It starts out as a flower with a
long stem and the it's in sand

998fb3de-096b-43e4-87c4-039510dfafb0-1
00:47:29.078 --> 00:47:34.310
appears to be sand and the sand
comes up around it.

658ab639-6654-46e9-adf6-959e53ea4973-0
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.300
Uh.

ddc45cc8-e0b1-4efc-a186-741604a0b986-0
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:44.175
Deepening for whatever reason,
and you can see it more closely

ddc45cc8-e0b1-4efc-a186-741604a0b986-1
00:47:44.175 --> 00:47:45.460
that it has.

d23325e9-6a6b-4426-91ef-9df51e40126b-0
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:52.936
It evolves over and has a kind
of looks kind of prickly and

d23325e9-6a6b-4426-91ef-9df51e40126b-1
00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:56.810
then feathery and then it
solidifies.

fdc8a464-3452-4dbb-817f-a079cf35e76f-0
00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:58.540
OK.

a94a7c25-5da2-4fac-ba99-6b3ef317ab47-0
00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:04.521
And now maybe this is it's a
continuing on. I think this

a94a7c25-5da2-4fac-ba99-6b3ef317ab47-1
00:48:04.521 --> 00:48:04.900
same.

3d0da1bd-3f90-425f-ab71-3db09c0fc9c8-0
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:12.551
Oh, I see here the this is one
one thing and it spawned from

3d0da1bd-3f90-425f-ab71-3db09c0fc9c8-1
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:14.380
its beginning it.

2e71e4dd-b5d2-4c31-8916-0b5f531cf4db-0
00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:23.159
Continues on from the top to the
2nd row. So this is one piece

2e71e4dd-b5d2-4c31-8916-0b5f531cf4db-1
00:48:23.159 --> 00:48:30.274
and then it goes on in the third
row to become more solid and

2e71e4dd-b5d2-4c31-8916-0b5f531cf4db-2
00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:34.749
then it develops 6 petals or
seeds or.

993e1ea0-bf14-41fc-a406-9ddb25ef8a98-0
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.087
Which fall on the on the ground,
on the sand, and then it itself

993e1ea0-bf14-41fc-a406-9ddb25ef8a98-1
00:48:41.087 --> 00:48:45.360
turns black. It appears to have
accomplished its mission.

b6d0eef5-12ed-4f31-b4e3-9ed9c295f44e-0
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.500
And then it.

2040b7b8-ef67-4f25-9bbe-48794e275c38-0
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:56.681
Begins to disintegrate and
leaves at the end only a

2040b7b8-ef67-4f25-9bbe-48794e275c38-1
00:48:56.681 --> 00:48:59.050
skeleton of itself.

39f6a657-8024-4619-91c0-1836738243d4-0
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.390
We have a city here in.

d02aca0f-b5e8-4741-abbb-0434e77a77f3-0
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.090
The shadows.

5ce13c93-c430-4a6a-99cc-c8bf0499d6d8-0
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:16.200
Uh.

865b4bb9-13a0-48b8-878e-acb11da42ba0-0
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.440
It has.

c89d5fa5-912b-467f-9bdc-2c3798ef5543-0
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.210
Several.

e298e518-4cd1-48d8-aded-69cfdc470e10-0
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:36.365
Areas of it several levels looks
as if there may be a bridge,

e298e518-4cd1-48d8-aded-69cfdc470e10-1
00:49:36.365 --> 00:49:37.980
river possibly.

3db41822-7b3d-4dea-beb4-899879fdb7ec-0
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.669
There's certainly a walkway.
There's a person on that walk,

3db41822-7b3d-4dea-beb4-899879fdb7ec-1
00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:44.080
people on that walkway.

41f6e18a-a29d-48c2-8a47-88afa166bf67-0
00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.739
And it's hard to see if there is
any kind of traffic other than

41f6e18a-a29d-48c2-8a47-88afa166bf67-1
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:52.350
people.

35705759-ec5c-4788-a636-3b6c582bfdc8-0
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.760
Then we see.

72516569-b080-4b2f-8d7d-76bf06b527be-0
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.340
Another view of this same city.

226a3493-6ca4-4261-a3fe-81c1c8d618d3-0
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.200
Uh.

5d164b25-4b18-469c-ad59-febc86dda371-0
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:09.677
From a different angle and it
appears as though there are

5d164b25-4b18-469c-ad59-febc86dda371-1
00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:13.850
trees and a roadway coming into
this city.

ba7353f8-2f49-4f01-b0ee-4d512bf0e5cb-0
00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:24.628
Several edifices, this
triangular thing, like a big

ba7353f8-2f49-4f01-b0ee-4d512bf0e5cb-1
00:50:24.628 --> 00:50:25.470
teepee.

57283654-c87c-40b3-8711-84855ebdad08-0
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.461
See that over on the left hand
side. This is just a looks as if

57283654-c87c-40b3-8711-84855ebdad08-1
00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:32.460
it might be just a blow up of
it.

7e51dfe6-eb02-4623-b8f4-5248a671e0bb-0
00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:39.985
And we get to see a little
closer that this is made up of

7e51dfe6-eb02-4623-b8f4-5248a671e0bb-1
00:50:39.985 --> 00:50:42.130
what appeared to be dishes.

b1460c1b-147d-4033-b420-e9613629a70c-0
00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:47.730
Just shapes the things you might
find in your kitchen.

574de229-46d7-44b4-ba99-dab2649f917b-0
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:49.260
Yeah.

c29d6a0c-1020-4ea4-9ecc-213dc9cf19d7-0
00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:03.080
OK, now we have this creature
lighting on the pot.

60a3da00-3a71-45a9-afca-dd77f73ddfd0-0
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.370
It looks to be some kind of an
insect.

a8b4938f-f2c5-4e1b-a487-df39514f06b1-0
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.600
It is in the window sill.

2463e0d5-906f-4799-9b6c-5e3fe6812d04-0
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:21.270
Where a man lives and he's
sitting on his bed.

ae71bb63-5058-4d0f-aa37-e0c10500e364-0
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.610
And also on that window sill.

869f2d33-ef7a-4189-8ded-b871d73d0c21-0
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.910
Is the.

cf730f53-850d-47d4-9516-94d9e9ac5441-0
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.840
Mouse.

a882b571-f7b8-4c0a-ab26-59a333b2b9f3-0
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:41.230
Somewhere between an elephant
and a mouse.

b23cb3fb-7c70-497a-bf3f-6d1462726fce-0
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:52.546
And he hears it, apparently. It
starts to move and he is looking

b23cb3fb-7c70-497a-bf3f-6d1462726fce-1
00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:58.300
at a photograph, but he turns
around to see where it is and it

b23cb3fb-7c70-497a-bf3f-6d1462726fce-2
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:03.872
sees it go down a hatch, like
opening with a stair a ladder.

b23cb3fb-7c70-497a-bf3f-6d1462726fce-3
00:52:03.872 --> 00:52:09.443
And he goes down the ladder to
see what it is. And the mouse

b23cb3fb-7c70-497a-bf3f-6d1462726fce-4
00:52:09.443 --> 00:52:11.909
has found this letter that.

2ba52253-22d0-4f2b-90be-b0474a8df861-0
00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.870
has come in through a slot
outside.

e21a8fbf-f215-44d4-8ed6-de17fd62343c-0
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.191
He picks up, the mouse notifies
him, in other words, that the

e21a8fbf-f215-44d4-8ed6-de17fd62343c-1
00:52:20.191 --> 00:52:24.776
letter has come, and he sees the
letter, and in it is the bird

e21a8fbf-f215-44d4-8ed6-de17fd62343c-2
00:52:24.776 --> 00:52:29.506
that the man has made out of his
letter. He reads the letter and

e21a8fbf-f215-44d4-8ed6-de17fd62343c-3
00:52:29.506 --> 00:52:30.380
he looks up.

8fd3c7f7-f2d6-4f7f-afef-2d5e3bd94e7d-0
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:32.190
OK.

a4978229-9956-4de0-b23b-37052b178851-0
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.780
Here is a.

1d238211-5d9c-4575-8f3e-44618d6805c2-0
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.882
An insect somewhere between the
mouse and the insect could be a

1d238211-5d9c-4575-8f3e-44618d6805c2-1
00:52:44.882 --> 00:52:49.070
mouse that has somebody has made
out of folded paper.

2dedc7ed-3d8d-4ece-8c5c-f236c7a1d999-0
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.740
And it is.

ce63b175-f08a-44a5-af5d-1b73fd3624f6-0
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:59.100
Then put into the lid of a
triangular shape.

5383ef08-d86c-4ed2-b8c2-39c2a976bb56-0
00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:04.600
Pot.

a1502298-18f6-4f5a-ab84-7dad107f5d4a-0
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.170
Then we have a hat hanging on a
peg.

2bdc1bdf-86d4-42b9-bc75-751925477a34-0
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.630
The.

b467c8d4-ac85-4ce4-812d-ee264e395f8a-0
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.520
This is growing in a bowl. It's
whatever it is.

63bfa07d-4fda-4d2c-bc26-b97e2b76d8de-0
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:25.440
With the twists and curlicues
and we have a bag of.

42cb6549-0c27-4655-ae99-dbf3f8ebf343-0
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.440
Picture of a drawing of this
bird.

a1adf44d-05d9-4ca1-a145-04a8ca588538-0
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:32.280
Uh.

cc0e0301-f86f-44b4-bf47-42c47c6729d4-0
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.569
Has roughly the same shape as
the mouse, as a boat as an

cc0e0301-f86f-44b4-bf47-42c47c6729d4-1
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:43.464
insect, and then we have the
with the star which is again

cc0e0301-f86f-44b4-bf47-42c47c6729d4-2
00:53:43.464 --> 00:53:46.080
repeated that triangular shape.

96cb5ea7-49f8-4722-bb26-b3bcb913f781-0
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.540
In a circular form, which we've
seen. Oh, I see this is.

a3d9a948-b6e8-452f-b1a6-ae51a89de537-0
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.250
OK, it's hard to say which way
these are going.

a07bdac7-7439-4a8b-9b2b-5d5a9b4d98cc-0
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.130
Then.

71c0221f-d476-4b56-b431-f6fe0b3dc4c8-0
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:03.350
it's a

65b91222-adb3-4ddc-9ef0-5d825e2c17ee-0
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:10.390
Looks like a key somewhere
between a.

06c7e00f-862f-4d74-bf34-1c772dddc590-0
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.480
Hard to tell what that is. It
seems to be some kind of a.

0501bd96-d7ff-440a-b1c3-105fdb75f13e-0
00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:25.453
Grinder and maybe then you with
a handle on the top and a place

0501bd96-d7ff-440a-b1c3-105fdb75f13e-1
00:54:25.453 --> 00:54:31.166
for a spout for whatever is
inside to be ground and to come

0501bd96-d7ff-440a-b1c3-105fdb75f13e-2
00:54:31.166 --> 00:54:37.069
out of that spout. And another
part to this is a maybe a lid.

dc62e5c5-b544-44da-892a-8087ad3e28e6-0
00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.120
With a.

63dc24af-5e20-408e-a77a-c7fc50ff25e4-0
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.690
Like a can opener.

026a9f18-9ea0-41bb-b7cf-6deba5ab9822-0
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.990
Then we have on this side a cup
with a tail coming out of it.

373b6d35-46cf-4387-b24e-ac6ea699f855-0
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:57.345
And a newspaper. And then we
have a photograph of a man, a

373b6d35-46cf-4387-b24e-ac6ea699f855-1
00:54:57.345 --> 00:54:59.430
woman and a little girl.

5e60eabd-3dbc-41e0-acf6-92e6c813b97c-0
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:06.490
Then we have a hand putting a
coin into a smaller hand.

11de9c6e-d02d-4891-a5ed-0be5e2b10eed-0
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.815
Not sure how those connect, but
here they are. Ah, now we're

11de9c6e-d02d-4891-a5ed-0be5e2b10eed-1
00:55:12.815 --> 00:55:17.471
going to see them all now
together. Ah I see. There's the

11de9c6e-d02d-4891-a5ed-0be5e2b10eed-2
00:55:17.471 --> 00:55:22.367
family, the mother wearing a
housecoat, the father wearing a

11de9c6e-d02d-4891-a5ed-0be5e2b10eed-3
00:55:22.367 --> 00:55:27.343
suit apparently ready to go to
work, and the little girl. And

11de9c6e-d02d-4891-a5ed-0be5e2b10eed-4
00:55:27.343 --> 00:55:29.429
he is holding up his hand.

0029d0ed-9f0b-4cc1-ab64-dc215a044fd0-0
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.910
To show the little girl.

6685cbf4-ee3e-4852-9cb6-0965c905b92c-0
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:37.606
It's similar to whatever that is
that's growing on the table and

6685cbf4-ee3e-4852-9cb6-0965c905b92c-1
00:55:37.606 --> 00:55:42.197
is growing in the bowl in front
of her or that she's eating in

6685cbf4-ee3e-4852-9cb6-0965c905b92c-2
00:55:42.197 --> 00:55:45.039
the bowl in front of her and the
fish.

bd08d67f-8983-477e-96f2-eecfd1cda2b9-0
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:51.260
Mouse fish combined with a
mouse.

5c0fe089-e955-4329-8d56-b75dd344c652-0
00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.890
That looks to be the family pet.

7ffd3e33-9a4c-4d28-ada8-d7ec57394467-0
00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:01.624
And the little girl is going
with the family pet down a long

7ffd3e33-9a4c-4d28-ada8-d7ec57394467-1
00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:05.641
flight of stairs. Maybe she's
going to school. Looks as if

7ffd3e33-9a4c-4d28-ada8-d7ec57394467-2
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:07.140
she's got a jacket on.

3ac88f08-d5a3-41c3-a2c2-e7f2d8878877-0
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:12.736
Then she's putting on her boots,
so here ok we probably have to

3ac88f08-d5a3-41c3-a2c2-e7f2d8878877-1
00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:17.063
start with her getting dressed.
So she's putting on her boots

3ac88f08-d5a3-41c3-a2c2-e7f2d8878877-2
00:56:17.063 --> 00:56:21.320
and getting her hat. The little
creature is waiting for her.

bd1ddc05-bfb6-4204-848f-ba233b20fcfb-0
00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:30.422
She has a hat on with this motif
is circular again. Here she's

bd1ddc05-bfb6-4204-848f-ba233b20fcfb-1
00:56:30.422 --> 00:56:38.244
outside with showing the the pet
some things on the ground and

bd1ddc05-bfb6-4204-848f-ba233b20fcfb-2
00:56:38.244 --> 00:56:39.610
then she's.

eccd4d53-7be4-4f6a-b228-84d5eba2aa66-0
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:47.190
Sending off a circular lit thing
that's kind of a magic

88e3a14f-ddd0-40c4-8f13-e8d59c8ccd9a-0
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:51.050
Message, I would say.
#END_arrival_6

ed6fbc80-09ff-4982-8a07-180f9d4126d0-0
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:53.000
OK.

ebc77297-8c71-42bc-8e15-899c4ca5d8b5-0
00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:58.563
So that was the story that took
about 10 minutes. That was

ebc77297-8c71-42bc-8e15-899c4ca5d8b5-1
00:56:58.563 --> 00:56:58.870
great.

83133a9b-a044-47b9-b720-d0b598992e05-0
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:03.572
OK, so next one is just one
complex scene. Again, please

83133a9b-a044-47b9-b720-d0b598992e05-1
00:57:03.572 --> 00:57:07.675
take between three and five
minutes and I'll let you know

83133a9b-a044-47b9-b720-d0b598992e05-2
00:57:07.675 --> 00:57:09.090
when it's 3 minutes.

876e44e6-58f4-4174-a1f6-9a13d9176e3e-0
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:19.872
#START_picture_this OK, we have
here what appear to be a number

876e44e6-58f4-4174-a1f6-9a13d9176e3e-1
00:57:19.872 --> 00:57:21.840
of drawings in frames.

61cbbefa-e6c7-4202-9da7-60f4837a74e0-0
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.970
Most of them are rectangular,
but some.

95e3efb2-6f48-42b3-a24f-b32ba7a14e3a-0
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:27.440

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.001
They have some kind of shape to
them other than that, but mostly

2326ba60-cba6-49c4-8ff1-6d6f03f815ff-1
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:37.670
rectangular.

18d52ab1-ffb0-450d-8669-0ce07e61f01e-0
00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.130
And they are a people's faces of
people's bodies.

8536306e-b44e-4784-ab82-f6db817b3421-0
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.760

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:52.086
The full shape of a person.
Here's what looks like a

d53b008f-749e-4e04-8881-285437f5cc09-1
00:57:52.086 --> 00:57:57.261
rhinoceros, one a couple of
people and another some warriors

d53b008f-749e-4e04-8881-285437f5cc09-2
00:57:57.261 --> 00:57:58.280
with Spears.

97bbf50c-285d-484b-89af-854b30e9140b-0
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.600

Looks as if somebody is bringing
some.

01ffa756-7c88-4f39-8213-666fbc291c48-0
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:13.050
Somebody put on another person

maybe doing some praying with a
loincloth on.

6d526318-f86a-4e8e-972c-978a17310e77-0

Maybe some kind of religious
figure. Here's another one

759f2c09-8646-4813-b6f6-ebca4571fa95-1
00:58:37.375 --> 00:58:42.459

Viking as a Viking.

We have a dinosaur over here, or
a kind of a reptile creature

0e28f157-1af3-4fda-a7f6-de2180e1d60c-1
00:59:03.248 --> 00:59:08.609

Uh, wouldn't that be nice if we
had anything like that

725a0dab-2921-4142-bd03-7f6807b79249-1
00:59:28.157 --> 00:59:29.150

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:44.690
And is preparing to eat that and
offer it to the pet. He then

c0b13780-aba2-493f-acad-5cc275894a02-1
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:50.177
puts a coat on and leaves and
the the as. As he is leaving the

c0b13780-aba2-493f-acad-5cc275894a02-2
01:07:50.177 --> 01:07:52.790
family pet offers him the hat.

1c2dbd81-b3b2-4c83-be36-932016eef93b-0
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:03.590
He's off into the city with all
the other working people who

1c2dbd81-b3b2-4c83-be36-932016eef93b-1
01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:07.412
have brought their pets with
them. One of them has what looks

1c2dbd81-b3b2-4c83-be36-932016eef93b-2
01:08:07.412 --> 01:08:08.460
like a duck here.

039f4053-0b25-4c53-916c-6c09f5268bbd-0
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.280
And he has his pet.

5e70d00f-4ff3-4669-ba68-b4da3ac13933-0
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:18.635
He is wearing a hat as so many
other people are, but his hat

5e70d00f-4ff3-4669-ba68-b4da3ac13933-1
01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:20.940
looks particularly stylish.

baeb6864-4123-4b6b-8bca-a9aaacb53024-0
01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.623
There are people working on the
street, they've got a they're

baeb6864-4123-4b6b-8bca-a9aaacb53024-1
01:08:43.623 --> 01:08:45.000
pulling on a rope.

686ac7e0-509e-4491-8706-edfa77eaf995-0
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.270
Or a bar or something. And
here's another fish.

52069c21-03a6-4def-9444-9bba75f115c1-0
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:56.423
A guy who's selling fish he's
taken out of a basket. Here is

52069c21-03a6-4def-9444-9bba75f115c1-1
01:08:56.423 --> 01:08:58.560
what looked like the cafe.

33ff1ae8-3b08-4df6-968e-64a16685b644-0
01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:05.640
And people are selling these
strangely shaped objects.

b700e598-f89c-4f05-9214-d9337c58c278-0
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.772
I don't know what they're doing,
whether they're exchanging money

b700e598-f89c-4f05-9214-d9337c58c278-1
01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:13.800
for something, and it looks as
if they're offering this to the

b700e598-f89c-4f05-9214-d9337c58c278-2
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.290
barmaid, but it's hard to tell.

5c876278-f4a0-410b-b207-1f8cea6252c4-0
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:21.671
Then we have somebody else here
with a round again our motif of

5c876278-f4a0-410b-b207-1f8cea6252c4-1
01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:24.840
the triangle and the and the
circle.

2700cd54-e540-4ddb-86a1-56a112831356-0
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.632
Looks like it might be something
that is can be made to rotate.

2700cd54-e540-4ddb-86a1-56a112831356-1
01:09:32.632 --> 01:09:37.455
And then we have a person
painting on the wall here with a

2700cd54-e540-4ddb-86a1-56a112831356-2
01:09:37.455 --> 01:09:40.480
paint brush and then another
person.

934a59fb-5906-4d25-a820-7852872b428c-0
01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.680
With a cart.

d9c326fa-1bbc-465d-bc9d-906bce3f1a79-0
01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.970
That she has her wares in it.

be00d635-3a0d-4251-8ec2-da10ce491aa4-0
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:49.060
Our fellow who is

9747672d-88ea-4dfa-9cdb-a810046c6bd7-0
01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.490
With the hat and pet goes to.

6a97fcf6-dae2-4938-9070-675e9605fd4b-0
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.860
Is asking somebody who looks
like a Baker.

5fa030d2-73c3-48c8-94b2-9dc982f2afd0-0
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.580
for something and the guy is
saying no.

5a8b0401-49fb-4a28-a167-a43fece53123-0
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:09.735
And he goes to somebody else who
looks to be He might be a clock

5a8b0401-49fb-4a28-a167-a43fece53123-1
01:10:09.735 --> 01:10:14.029
maker or some kind of a
machinist, and he's telling him

5a8b0401-49fb-4a28-a167-a43fece53123-2
01:10:14.029 --> 01:10:14.259
no.

2c631a74-3393-43d2-84c8-f0c5ee7e28fe-0
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:19.976
And that he goes to another
place. Looks like it might be a

2c631a74-3393-43d2-84c8-f0c5ee7e28fe-1
01:10:19.976 --> 01:10:23.200
ceramic place that has a bunch
of cats.

92b650d7-8c65-41a4-93e0-b252d6f3b2ac-0
01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:24.590
Uh.

5d03cfbd-3b14-443b-b02f-e74e5d2e7883-0
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:27.940
Objects in within bowls.

aa158dd5-5855-45b4-a6d0-dff50e8b1112-0
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:33.736
And she is saying no. Are they
saying they don't know what he's

aa158dd5-5855-45b4-a6d0-dff50e8b1112-1
01:10:33.736 --> 01:10:37.320
talking about or haven't seen
that? I'm not sure.

b55fd9b1-570e-42dc-8d9d-166a8c254fa9-0
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.733
And again, he is asking somebody
who looks to be near an

b55fd9b1-570e-42dc-8d9d-166a8c254fa9-1
01:10:47.733 --> 01:10:48.790
airplane.

43fa2925-12b5-4f1c-bb37-d577af18d982-0
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:55.806
He's got his pet with him and
the other fellow has a pet with

43fa2925-12b5-4f1c-bb37-d577af18d982-1
01:10:55.806 --> 01:10:59.570
him and he is telling him no or
he's telling him.

998bf919-605f-44ef-ad95-8635dfbe32ce-0
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.220
Try someplace else.

a18362e8-d895-4b64-b652-0a20b8dc916e-0
01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:08.550
OK, not not, not coming across
for me. #END_arrival_5

7c9a9ee1-024e-4aa2-a951-b128e4d3c71c-0
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.710
All right. So that was the
story.

3a4aa405-eab7-4322-976a-629ba4c51664-0
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:13.380
I'm going to.
