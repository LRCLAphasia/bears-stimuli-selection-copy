00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:53.590
letter going to the mailbox.

87f55d85-5450-4762-880e-545cbe2c1011-0
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.570
Um.

1077d803-33d9-4ad1-bb0f-c18136c59644-0
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.400
He's looking up in the sky,
he's.

9fbaf612-5aa2-4b67-be8c-82b70a845502-0
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.030
And then he's walking away.

9e3b90b1-0732-4e33-8f79-f739827f317a-0
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.380
OK.

e5a48518-0c48-42c5-ae4d-41fcdcee83b1-0
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.750
Looks like a leaf.

127e91dd-4ef8-4394-98be-a0e9847ff4e4-0
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.130
Yeah, and then a flower.

80304b6b-414f-4ee9-be4e-318d671617eb-0
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.190
Looks like a leaf turns into a
flower.

4a89911b-d3ee-4760-afca-a2d88c3edf8e-0
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.972
{That's about it.}  And then it
looks like it's turning into a

4a89911b-d3ee-4760-afca-a2d88c3edf8e-1
00:08:28.972 --> 00:08:30.080
more of a flower.

7e5cc063-f0b7-490a-aed4-815097ea5dff-0
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.750
{Can you hear me?}

d1e12164-d0da-4c40-bdef-8c6dfefc5c1e-0
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.575
OK, yes, yeah, yeah. It looks
like a leaf that is budding into

d1e12164-d0da-4c40-bdef-8c6dfefc5c1e-1
00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:41.340
a flower.

ad6a4ecc-f714-4b70-866d-c6ac952f4120-0
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.300
OK.

32febbac-8260-4f82-9d4b-027c6515bd51-0
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.970
{OK, go on.}

e1b668e1-6c4b-44ee-860e-78f02679da2c-0
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.340
OK.

03db1ace-1499-4c4f-bf2c-7e5a52283c36-0
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.710
I see buildings, tall building
in the back.

f1cd1367-bb98-449f-82e3-c0fa29af6ea7-0
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.240
Smaller building up front with a
lot of little figures.

01cf1e1d-a093-46ae-a77d-b376d4438ed2-0
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.520
The next page I see.

29d94c21-62d6-4922-9ee7-2e59d47d1120-0
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.500
Looks like a teepee.

1c9e2511-a2ed-40e0-9ddb-93e1bb6bed4c-0
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.290
Then there's.

5ed965b5-902a-4ab9-9af6-b7db5e552571-0
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.450
A lot of vases. Pottery. {Sorry,
sorry.}

370608a8-cbb7-4524-92bb-73ce87dac296-0
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.000
{It's OK.}

755cdbcc-2bc6-466e-9302-dbd9fda44cdd-0
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.020
And then a smokestack looks like
a town.

40aca5c9-612a-4f3d-ae78-2ab2a0a71be0-0
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.350
The city.

31ff5b5e-84f6-4246-bdba-ec44fb3665bc-0
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.800
Looks like a town of pottery.

b6c7b6ef-014d-4382-a458-85188e70c135-0
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.890
OK. Yeah.

b081f184-1e41-482c-b3f0-956d4d44cd77-0
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.990
Then I see the the pot again the
vase.

3a6c6a8c-349d-4797-ba9b-ff017483a453-0
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.140
And it looks like a bird.

8e0cf71e-bea7-422b-9aa5-bb5a8dd202ae-0
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.360
Then I see a woman in a bed, a
man in a bedroom.

264e0262-edc5-4fd4-a636-4e179f4a63eb-0
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.250
Looking at a picture.

417207e0-76fa-4983-82da-3daceaadf474-0
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.990
Could be of his family.

db25f123-7b1e-4a0b-926f-df469c1af199-0
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.850
Then I see the looks to be a
mouse. I'm not sure the animal.

152b944f-bece-4a0b-bf07-2ec6c6280787-0
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.020
Umm.

5777b694-dd21-478d-8848-4c2ea10cf516-0
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.998
And the man is looking away from
the picture and the animal is

5777b694-dd21-478d-8848-4c2ea10cf516-1
00:10:21.998 --> 00:10:25.370
going down steps. The man is
going down steps.

be1de282-e0fb-40ed-9bee-3bb2f284e62e-0
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.260
Then it looks like the mouse
sees a letter.

f494b59c-0f5b-4af7-b7da-ff6df37f3afa-0
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.075
Man opens up the letter and he
sees the paper bird. He's

f494b59c-0f5b-4af7-b7da-ff6df37f3afa-1
00:10:37.075 --> 00:10:40.370
reading it and he's smiling.
Now. He's looking out the

f494b59c-0f5b-4af7-b7da-ff6df37f3afa-2
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.790
window.

bb3ee424-41a2-40a2-808c-ccd6c84b1246-0
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.150
And it looks like a paper.

9d2b76a2-7e67-44b8-9e99-6b65973aa0fb-0
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.150
Figure again.

0fb11e72-e2ce-4cdf-bde6-89f57b3547ae-0
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.600
Some dishes.

50c4ec22-eee1-40a8-8f4c-e496bce61df8-0
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.650
And the man's hat and his.

ec23a938-b6fa-4343-a376-1513a8e41113-0
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.220
I guess a coat is hanging up.

b1b4eaa9-dd81-4481-b374-a059bbc25f63-0
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.830
Umm.

bffc666b-3989-41d3-86aa-47877a68ffb8-0
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.200
Then in the there's a bowl.

179bf3fc-06ea-4dea-9d6d-4746d824881b-0
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.600
With something in it, I'm not
sure.

0f1c2f51-5d17-401a-a58c-76ada4f0b7c8-0
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.550
Then there's a picture of a
boat.

44210092-5963-4702-a8fd-1dc07c20df88-0
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.480
I'm not sure what these figures
are.

2878a21c-965c-49bb-9808-b5463d1f952d-0
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.542
Then I see a coffee cup with a
newspaper underneath. Then I see

2878a21c-965c-49bb-9808-b5463d1f952d-1
00:11:29.542 --> 00:11:33.500
a man with his looks like to be
his wife and his daughter.

63a48625-0f2c-4e7a-922d-d473c5486b61-0
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.230
And then I see a hand with
somebody giving somebody money.

cfda8753-599d-4210-9a43-5db2922dc6e4-0
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.284
Umm, I'm assuming it's the
father giving the daughter.

cfda8753-599d-4210-9a43-5db2922dc6e4-1
00:11:45.284 --> 00:11:47.670
Yeah, the father's giving
daughter money.

63813b4c-ef5f-4de8-8cfe-6128b0a4a555-0
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.928
With the little animal down
below and the wife is there

63813b4c-ef5f-4de8-8cfe-6128b0a4a555-1
00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:52.750
smiling, looks like.

cde051fc-d2cd-47e6-861d-c251bf3a3097-0
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.760
He's holding three up.

e22023b3-9983-4743-8b00-c0c7bc8a2b47-0
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.070
Looks like the daughter is
putting on her boots.

65f8d9b6-093a-4e0c-98df-c48e8cd301fc-0
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.980
Along with the animal.

fdf4f29d-f675-4643-8793-c37cac106923-0
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.815
Is that a mouse? I guess it's a
it's something, yeah. Then it

fdf4f29d-f675-4643-8793-c37cac106923-1
00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:13.356
looks like the daughter is
crying, but she's leaving with

fdf4f29d-f675-4643-8793-c37cac106923-2
00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:14.140
the mouse.

2cbdd13e-ede9-4c20-b16f-0b495c7e85fa-0
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:15.740
Umm.

646d9fed-1afd-4fcf-af54-b9d59ce4a451-0
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.270
And they're going somewhere.

098bcceb-3270-41e1-add3-28d0c3568e3e-0
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.085
#END_arrival-6 And and the
little girl is putting her hand

098bcceb-3270-41e1-add3-28d0c3568e3e-1
00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:23.870
up to a light.

9c2ed20b-2bf7-4d7c-b509-a095a3aa9319-0
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.135
{OK. That was the part of this
story and we're going to

9c2ed20b-2bf7-4d7c-b509-a095a3aa9319-1
00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:37.770
continue to item 3. So this is
also a complex scene. Describe

9c2ed20b-2bf7-4d7c-b509-a095a3aa9319-2
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.806
what you see and what is
happening. Just roughly take

9c2ed20b-2bf7-4d7c-b509-a095a3aa9319-3
00:12:41.806 --> 00:12:46.441
three or five minutes, 3 between
2, three to five minutes and

9c2ed20b-2bf7-4d7c-b509-a095a3aa9319-4
00:12:46.441 --> 00:12:48.310
I'll check at that time.}

fce9462c-8781-4f8a-b983-4ae9af75c502-0
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.144
#START_make_a_splash All right.
It's looks like a water park.

fce9462c-8781-4f8a-b983-4ae9af75c502-1
00:12:53.144 --> 00:12:54.260
It's a lot of people.

98160808-cf63-4def-8283-b2fafbf6cc64-0
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:01.260
There's children going down, the
water slides.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.760
They're going down.

66d750d8-5ef8-4731-872d-15faf2ffd23b-0
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.943
On their backside, they're going
down frontwards. {Excuse me,}

66d750d8-5ef8-4731-872d-15faf2ffd23b-1
00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:09.040
there's an elephant.

9c417f24-eba6-49ab-a544-7c32402ffbda-0
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.793

elephant and everybody there's a

9c417f24-eba6-49ab-a544-7c32402ffbda-1
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.470
pool right below the elephant.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:21.497
With a bunch of people and kids,
mostly kids, mostly children.

29feaeb8-080c-404d-8627-cf2afe298d5b-1
00:13:21.497 --> 00:13:24.330
They're on rafts and water
tubes.

00a806c7-5e32-4da8-b511-9dd6297f91f5-0
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.730
Um.

8367609b-7906-4447-9494-81a960e659de-0
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.110
Everybody looks like they're
having a good time.

3cf7627d-145e-452c-ba14-de3cdfe36283-0
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.160
There's a boy with a water gun
shooting people in the pool.

56763cb5-1d7f-4371-8d6f-baec81b99835-0
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.830

There's a lifeguard.

8960bbea-9d97-49b5-ad27-8b784895064c-0
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.480
Just sitting there.

eccac177-b947-43da-a659-6bc345a8ec26-0
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.024
Then in the water park there's a
bigger slide with with children

eccac177-b947-43da-a659-6bc345a8ec26-1
00:13:52.024 --> 00:13:52.700

Also in the background there's
they're in a pool with water,

71efba7b-3ed4-44f6-b048-c583856d8ba6-1
00:13:59.018 --> 00:14:00.890

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.676
There's a man or a boy standing
up on something. Looks like he's

847d3f94-1aad-410e-b3bc-d62073a7da6d-1
00:14:10.676 --> 00:14:11.880
ready to fall over.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.500

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.322
And it looks like they're taking
the king away. Looks like the

f4e020bf-a1a8-49cd-92b0-b111bd565c28-1
00:20:59.322 --> 00:21:00.340
King lost this fight.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.070
And they're taking them away,
OK?

32482a8e-8867-474f-80fc-14fb9ee9ba83-0
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.080
The boy is drawing.

f5910fad-8c55-49f7-8fde-8c63bc8214bc-0
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.770
Something.

4eedce41-a9c3-4013-bc31-3a8d88f57ba3-0
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.840
Umm.

f1324e1b-ca3b-4c3c-85ff-fcadf95415e3-0
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.263
The man and the girl in the
background, and there's somebody

f1324e1b-ca3b-4c3c-85ff-fcadf95415e3-1
00:21:28.263 --> 00:21:31.833
chasing them and it looks like
he drew a fine horse, it looks

f1324e1b-ca3b-4c3c-85ff-fcadf95415e3-2
00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:35.231
like with wings, and it looks
like they're they're they're

f1324e1b-ca3b-4c3c-85ff-fcadf95415e3-3
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:35.750
escaping.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.460
OK.

9517c92b-22f7-45bb-89f9-0cc8e6d2649a-0
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.280
They're flying away.

abf1d242-4207-4895-8224-7c2cd9525c98-0
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.540
Away from the.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.300
And they look scared.

e5707cc3-5ada-4df1-9e27-8562527666f6-0
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.790
Yeah, OK.

644f7bbc-709b-4a06-9f8e-2a43135a1586-0
00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.720
Um.

85c4f45a-2b6c-4f21-ac1d-5c5a71bb69df-0
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.500
Looks like the king.

00c5e316-e4cc-467c-9467-7be7836e1929-0
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.600
Is with the people who captured
them, but the little boy,

00c5e316-e4cc-467c-9467-7be7836e1929-1
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.480
there's a little boy.

e54da0e1-29ca-4f1e-bbbe-3dd11707e79c-0
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.240
Holding on to his arm.

f476fafd-1d6c-4c05-80b2-fc034bc472d1-0
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.342
And the man is with the girl
with the crown. He's holding on

f476fafd-1d6c-4c05-80b2-fc034bc472d1-1
00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:32.280
to her. Looks like they're
falling.

97f0c01f-a3cf-4c9c-a0af-05d69aa48557-0
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.310
And it looks like they fell into
the ocean.

f9e0d87c-6abb-4f33-a878-5bb89d9e8020-0
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.540
Umm.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:49.970
And yet.

ec42b1e3-d05d-4626-a8f8-a25662a38463-0
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.658
They're drawing probably a boat
to to escape, that's what I'm

ec42b1e3-d05d-4626-a8f8-a25662a38463-1
00:22:55.658 --> 00:22:56.220
assuming.

193ed6db-67de-4f85-9820-0d9e7a1372fc-0
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.109
OK. The man and the and the
girl. {OK. Yep. All right, go

193ed6db-67de-4f85-9820-0d9e7a1372fc-1
00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:02.500
ahead.}

066ea36e-d80a-4e97-b541-6d52989deec4-0
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.890
Oh, it looks like.

6d22c1b5-8f48-4ef1-bcd2-20b578420a3a-0
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.770
They made it to the top and they
drew a submarine.

71c316c8-ed71-4e65-9287-73d6654ab79f-0
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.710
And they're moving along.

984bd270-4f25-4ee7-830d-00aa08250f94-0
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.500
OK.

57bff5c1-54b5-4b88-93e2-3be88f5092bc-0
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.518
The submarine has risen from
underneath the water and it

57bff5c1-54b5-4b88-93e2-3be88f5092bc-1
00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:26.140
looks like they're in a cave.

8c839fab-41d5-4ddc-8f48-24e8629d46c3-0
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.460
And they're looking at.

4981cc83-d576-48c9-bee2-36f727f0a9f0-0
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.630
What appears to be pictures.

c08947c0-5256-453b-b3c0-599a08dae566-0
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.040
And then they're not.

887de65b-f36b-406d-b82e-24a294ddb819-0
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.240
Maybe they went under again.
They submerged.

871062f1-7d5b-4a3a-ab0b-e53a6275f39c-0
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:48.640
In The Cave.

444720b1-fa45-4870-b1ca-31b3a7c23eb8-0
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.480
OK.

920c3c44-14a0-4d40-8a70-9847855d648e-0
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.700
Umm.

485c860a-6f4c-4930-836a-3a3386958bbb-0
00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.410
The girl is pointing up, looking
at the pictures.

f9f358a5-d3c8-4e5b-8c48-304034d93022-0
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.150
That were drawn.

d1d72c45-73fd-42a6-9111-430c48ed42ea-0
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.540
Looks like the pictures told the
story.

4a6334fe-ef34-4ecd-8741-cafcde2320e5-0
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.570
And then there's.

81302782-21c1-41d0-b889-12775701bc10-0
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.280
The picture of The Cave with an
opening.

97a88379-1e89-42fb-ab2f-e88350bbf085-0
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:21.940
Yeah.

a7c4a9bd-7945-4b2f-8d21-36b1b16eca94-0
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.970
Looks like the man in the and
the girl or.

425dc48d-0c55-47e7-af44-1516f36fc8bd-0
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.783
Moving along The Cave and then
they see some people, it looks

425dc48d-0c55-47e7-af44-1516f36fc8bd-1
00:24:36.783 --> 00:24:40.790
like the king in the background,
they're gonna draw some more.

99c81408-4ab6-45a8-976d-6c826519c9c0-0
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.110
I'm not sure what they're
drawing.

3a75f17f-07db-49dc-bc00-00cf06fe6a8d-0
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.480
But it's something probably for
them to get out of there.

b6fcf70b-537f-4234-8ddc-0f29d181ac47-0
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:54.680
OK.

9462c872-87d2-4a5c-b246-9982524f198f-0
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.550
Um.

147575f2-3092-4124-a12a-76af71e0775a-0
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.473
One of the men from the castle
is running towards what they

147575f2-3092-4124-a12a-76af71e0775a-1
00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:08.720
drew.

d352eba8-f7f0-4b7e-99a6-17e62511bdd5-0
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.404
And it looks like the man and
the girl are watching to see

d352eba8-f7f0-4b7e-99a6-17e62511bdd5-1
00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:15.450
what he's doing.

52470868-cd0e-492e-9b76-78585621359b-0
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.900
Umm.

5c9044ca-66ad-4f56-8922-d3c4fe95193c-0
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.030
Looks like he's trapped. It's it
was a trap.

ffd80e2a-4fc7-4037-815a-eef695feca4e-0
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.678
That the man from the castle has
gotten into that they draw that

ffd80e2a-4fc7-4037-815a-eef695feca4e-1
00:25:25.678 --> 00:25:26.300
they drew.

f5046251-88fb-4b17-887e-a3bc28ea4292-0
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.411
And it looks like the man is
getting ready to throw something

f5046251-88fb-4b17-887e-a3bc28ea4292-1
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:32.980
at him. As in the trap. Looks
like the trap worked.

3822e338-6b80-4fce-8408-4f3f4811b1cf-0
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:40.530
Umm.

d797a521-d72d-4775-9d4f-b06a745d6d62-0
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.060
The man from the castle still in
the trap, but it looks like.

bf05c667-f595-458b-9cbe-32a13caab51a-0
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.980
What the man had.

0dcd44d7-8377-4a7e-9bea-078b0102ebb5-0
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.440
Blew up and it's.

9045943f-99f7-4310-a9d5-f6bcfe4788e3-0
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.190
All over The Cave.

c68ff203-4da4-4bee-8d99-8d4fe2667802-0
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.240
And it looks like it's going to
take the king and the boy.

8a3146ba-fe73-4b01-80a6-8f24316b73a0-0
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.430
Up to somewhere.

36536583-17f3-4f38-988d-a676f5e16e06-0
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.829
It looks like they're going to
be safe and they're getting away

36536583-17f3-4f38-988d-a676f5e16e06-1
00:26:05.829 --> 00:26:06.020
from.

fb800cae-09d5-498e-8270-7191785bbaf9-0
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.880
The people from the castle.

ae7bd387-f59b-4ebc-9251-b33afd03cfc0-0
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.560
It looks like.

53312598-518d-43ab-af0f-9ac8ff5b6385-0
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.620
They're they're looking at.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.492
A bird that they were. I mean, I
guess it was a bird, or I

76ad2761-c202-486b-93a5-d4971baa30be-1
00:26:28.492 --> 00:26:31.916
thought it was a horse with
wings. Looks like it took the

76ad2761-c202-486b-93a5-d4971baa30be-2
00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:35.339
man away from the castle. He's
trapped and it looks like.

e9780460-1370-4259-9aa2-f07bd5cdf83f-0
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.640
The man, the boy and a girl on
the king are very pleased.

f3bd310e-7b10-49e4-9921-7867566f17a6-0
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:39.970

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.560
Looks like the girl is hugging
the man.

48598082-9f44-48b7-bdbf-fc3aff39a2b8-0
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.950
And the king is with the boy.

6a4ec970-9861-4c51-9a88-9f331d4721e9-0
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.370
They look like and they all look
like they're safe.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.960

flown.

be fine. There's no other people

00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.662
in the picture. It's the picture
of the apartment that was

8accbb91-c9fb-4b29-b25f-4c4465860f9b-2
00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:11.020
