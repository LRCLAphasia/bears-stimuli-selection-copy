00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.603
{So in the norming study you
will see two types of pictures,

1b7295e2-8fdf-47fe-8267-845be53d9e29-1
00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:12.350
and we'll start with the first
type, which are complex scenes.}

f34deabd-834e-44af-baca-bd79582c2acc-0
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.912
{We asked that you imagine
you're describing the scene to

f34deabd-834e-44af-baca-bd79582c2acc-1
00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:21.058
someone who cannot see the
picture. Describe what is

f34deabd-834e-44af-baca-bd79582c2acc-2
00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:24.500
happening and what you see in
this scene as thoroughly as

f34deabd-834e-44af-baca-bd79582c2acc-3
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.239
possible, and I'll let you know
when it's about 5 minutes, but

f34deabd-834e-44af-baca-bd79582c2acc-4
00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.503
take between three and five
minutes to describe a long

f34deabd-834e-44af-baca-bd79582c2acc-5
00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:31.860
time.}

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.750
{Yeah. OK. OK. So the first one,
it's right here.}

talking? Yes, whenever you OK.}

#START_unfriendly_giant This
looks like a.

587b602f-c30a-4b3e-8d6f-ccb5aa3e38da-0
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.650
Book for probably for children
that's open to.

f98bce3f-2311-431b-aebc-48810c521021-0
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.996
Both the left and the right
screen. So it's inside of a book

f98bce3f-2311-431b-aebc-48810c521021-1
00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:08.991
and it's got colors of of what
they call the unfriendly giants

f98bce3f-2311-431b-aebc-48810c521021-2
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:13.986
have to do with Waldo and the
wizard White Beard. They came to

f98bce3f-2311-431b-aebc-48810c521021-3
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:18.585
the land of unfriendly giants,
where many waldos had been

f98bce3f-2311-431b-aebc-48810c521021-4
00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:19.140
before.

239bfc6d-ad18-4a06-922a-1a7fd94726b4-0
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.509
Now I'm going to guess that some
of these pictures of these

239bfc6d-ad18-4a06-922a-1a7fd94726b4-1
00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.698
people, these drawings, these
colored cartoon drawings, are

239bfc6d-ad18-4a06-922a-1a7fd94726b4-2
00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:27.390
maybe waldos.

16776d2c-21be-498f-9920-451e5c4cb4df-0
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.024
Because it says they've been
there before, and Waldo saw that

16776d2c-21be-498f-9920-451e5c4cb4df-1
00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:37.427
the Giants were hardly harassing
the little people, and when he

16776d2c-21be-498f-9920-451e5c4cb4df-2
00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:41.279
found the 10th scroll, it was
time to continue with his

16776d2c-21be-498f-9920-451e5c4cb4df-3
00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.830
journey.

38d3ade5-7a48-4e28-a706-a24f2b1d4ed4-0
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.430
So basically it's like.

cbdfb69b-87e4-4937-a914-50f8893e0eee-0
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.130
An old time.

ac1a2de1-fae6-4911-b3a2-5ede05d0035c-0
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.470
Caricature of these giants and
Waldo.

31b31ec1-047b-4077-908c-9e9cb7373161-0
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.521
And the giant for very mean
they're harassing little people.

31b31ec1-047b-4077-908c-9e9cb7373161-1
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:02.608
There's little people in the
corners of the screen and in the

31b31ec1-047b-4077-908c-9e9cb7373161-2
00:02:02.608 --> 00:02:03.070
bottom.

02c51745-55ed-43c4-a8da-0f390d768c49-0
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.270
And the big people seem like
they're harassing them and.

03302d8d-df3a-4472-bfd5-be8e6a87a464-0
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.918
You know, left, right. But the
lady with her hand up against

03302d8d-df3a-4472-bfd5-be8e6a87a464-1
00:02:11.918 --> 00:02:15.510
someone who's coming up against
her, a gentleman, I don't know

03302d8d-df3a-4472-bfd5-be8e6a87a464-2
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.760
if I know, I call him a
gentleman if he's harassing her.

1c05bb25-0812-46f9-abd5-ad82be1d5d0f-0
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.157
uh two two pictures are like
that. One on the left and one on

1c05bb25-0812-46f9-abd5-ad82be1d5d0f-1
00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:27.548
the right. And we've got some
other people, I guess you call

1c05bb25-0812-46f9-abd5-ad82be1d5d0f-2
00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.549
people. They're more like
monsters.

dbd26b1e-a06d-43e9-8048-c53f63b59620-0
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.960
They are.

77fb577a-c826-4726-a8bf-1829d3d79861-0
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.110
spinning something at people
like using straws to.

3b72d221-8f6b-49a9-972b-312686eb3048-0
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.990
To hurt them with water, water,
it's very interesting.

f6c490c2-8647-4511-970c-29f367ef9072-0
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.966
There's a chess board where they
might have the little people

f6c490c2-8647-4511-970c-29f367ef9072-1
00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.490
actually moving on the chess
board.

2f3bcf6f-74b2-47b3-a4cf-b82c72c9c2c3-0
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.180
There's a lot of trees and
there's a windmill.

de7f6ee4-7f4f-4f71-9add-098e56802541-0
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.472
It's nothing I've ever seen
before in my life. I mean, sure,

de7f6ee4-7f4f-4f71-9add-098e56802541-1
00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.100
I've seen books like this, but.

1eb001b3-5b1b-40f4-8df4-866e6d8e6bee-0
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.940
Mostly it's.

3561c9d0-9f3b-416a-9677-892e2529a1bc-0
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.590
Something I'm just making up as
I go.

e42956f3-65df-49e3-be2d-676eb70d9663-0
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.790
And trying to explain it to you
the best I can.

56173bd1-c243-42ec-bea1-095fd941ff41-0
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.860
There's little houses.

d7c21019-187b-49c6-bc4c-674468f8f22e-0
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.342
Looks oh, oh, there's this.
Yeah, there is a man, a monster

d7c21019-187b-49c6-bc4c-674468f8f22e-1
00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:24.845
man, picking up a person, a
little baby person, and moving

d7c21019-187b-49c6-bc4c-674468f8f22e-2
00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:26.270
them on the chess board.

417567eb-8260-423d-b825-1095098b0f4b-0
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.690
It's an interesting scene.

1cabbcfd-60a9-49b2-b5da-671e415a173a-0
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.050
Very interesting. We got people
running.

f2120e64-1676-40ac-83d0-01f25806dd61-0
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.830
It's kind of chaotic, actually.

fab9792e-ab3a-4c13-90e3-3652b92b4e80-0
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.542
And there's one guy who's
talking to the little people.

fab9792e-ab3a-4c13-90e3-3652b92b4e80-1
00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:43.610
He's got his hat off to him like
he's nice.

bdf55cc1-0f8f-41e9-97cb-6ef7d3e9aff6-0
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.756
And there's somebody who's
trying to take a house with a

bdf55cc1-0f8f-41e9-97cb-6ef7d3e9aff6-1
00:03:49.756 --> 00:03:52.770
rope. He's trying to take these
people on a.

b13e0f27-05d2-4abf-b207-3d132f3c2d00-0
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.269
They must be on a platform or
somehow something. Their house,

b13e0f27-05d2-4abf-b207-3d132f3c2d00-1
00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.789
he's trying to drag them with
the rope. There's a big hammer.

b13e0f27-05d2-4abf-b207-3d132f3c2d00-2
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:04.320
It's kind of violent.

9aecab72-81a5-40cd-b8cf-3b4533608056-0
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.900
Oh, and there's a castle on the
back. There's a guy running to

9aecab72-81a5-40cd-b8cf-3b4533608056-1
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.181
the castle, actually, two people
running to the castle. They're

9aecab72-81a5-40cd-b8cf-3b4533608056-2
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.129
both men. You know what I'm
noticing?

caff827f-52eb-48a7-ba85-8218293c3f8d-0
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.532
Most of these characters are
men. There's only two women in

caff827f-52eb-48a7-ba85-8218293c3f8d-1
00:04:23.532 --> 00:04:27.650
here and they're both with their
hands up against the men, one on

caff827f-52eb-48a7-ba85-8218293c3f8d-2
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.205
the left and one on the right.
oh one is trying to offer

caff827f-52eb-48a7-ba85-8218293c3f8d-3
00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:34.200
flowers. I don't think she likes
him very much.

8867dfb8-a3ed-4dd4-8013-f2a4eb581839-0
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.600
Uh.

0c9abfc3-6ea4-431b-9a4b-000308a8f855-0
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.980
No, no. Very interesting
picture.

83f4db74-a0bb-41e1-879e-7c8a6ae5af44-0
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.560
Umm.

5d52f5ab-e6e0-4cdb-90c8-49cf346b6450-0
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.221
What else can I tell you about
this? Have you gotten the gist

5d52f5ab-e6e0-4cdb-90c8-49cf346b6450-1
00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:47.380
of it? There's some hills.

98d68707-8ab7-48bf-9a6f-6ecb1b57318b-0
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.600
Yeah, I wouldn't want to go
here.

10d9e43e-58a7-4966-9bf3-5bfed522dfb0-0
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.303

wouldn't want my kids to see

10d9e43e-58a7-4966-9bf3-5bfed522dfb0-1

this.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.950
{All right, so that was about 3
1/2 minutes.}

591c787e-2186-47bd-894a-c170c61debdf-0
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.920
{That's good, um.}

cd9891f9-cea4-4b6c-b746-dad53ed3309f-0
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.930
{Sometimes you see words talk
about what the picture.}

77f93521-0b9d-48fb-af5b-4c9505882aef-0
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.560
{And you don't have to read
them. That's for your own

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.950
information. OK, you would you
description and yeah, I like

77f93521-0b9d-48fb-af5b-4c9505882aef-2
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.705
that you're saying, oh, there's
a castle. And then just pointing

77f93521-0b9d-48fb-af5b-4c9505882aef-3
00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:29.387
out what you see. I think that's
really good to continue doing.

77f93521-0b9d-48fb-af5b-4c9505882aef-4
00:05:29.387 --> 00:05:31.290
So let's try another one.}

talking when you're ready.}

{Hmm.

bit older children and it's in

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.860
And um.

159b5e61-e92f-4f05-a791-b5be33be37e4-0
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.927
There's several several many
little boats. OK, I'm going to

159b5e61-e92f-4f05-a791-b5be33be37e4-1
00:06:22.927 --> 00:06:27.609
count for you
1234567891011121314 15 probably

159b5e61-e92f-4f05-a791-b5be33be37e4-2
00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:32.190
at least 15 boats surrounding
this big boat.

b8857891-6c65-482a-87ff-9cf323ef0272-0
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.962
Looks like this are kind of a
conflict going on here. That's

b8857891-6c65-482a-87ff-9cf323ef0272-1
00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:39.450
probably the pirates.

0c8ee738-bafb-4da3-a27c-ee75edc4a369-0
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.810
If I could read that better, I'd
know a little bit more, but it's

0c8ee738-bafb-4da3-a27c-ee75edc4a369-1
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.910
too small for my eyes.

1f5d0f1f-8a2c-474f-a831-2ca7de4f5e5c-0
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.206
People are trying to escape, I
think, and some boats are going

1f5d0f1f-8a2c-474f-a831-2ca7de4f5e5c-1
00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:50.520
down.

c947c1b3-27d5-406f-b3c4-36d8efd45610-0
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.679
There's an island that the
people are actually trying to

c947c1b3-27d5-406f-b3c4-36d8efd45610-1
00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:55.110
get to.

2d244de0-5d7f-4b8a-a008-3c0c692f54d7-0
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.640
They're trying to get to the
island.

3fcf6b14-7a0e-465e-8e33-141f50cf4617-0
00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.670
Or get.

bfaf9725-462c-4118-91aa-7c08a9ce79bf-0
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.353
And probably get to the island
away from the ship. It looks

bfaf9725-462c-4118-91aa-7c08a9ce79bf-1
00:07:04.353 --> 00:07:07.487
like they're running that way.
Yeah. So if they get off the

bfaf9725-462c-4118-91aa-7c08a9ce79bf-2
00:07:07.487 --> 00:07:09.420
boat and they get in a little
dingy.

52007764-0b3f-4aac-ad0c-0998003f0ef4-0
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.601
They can get to the islands and
they can survive this attack by

52007764-0b3f-4aac-ad0c-0998003f0ef4-1
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:16.590
the pirates.

6ef2482f-8c7b-40ac-b716-4460fd3d0405-0
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.201
Now, being that the Pirates
would probably be flying those

6ef2482f-8c7b-40ac-b716-4460fd3d0405-1
00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:26.890
flags, those are probably pirate
boats, and then maybe these are.

973a2602-e4f3-43b8-bdd7-fd2bccfc1f6d-0
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.580
Some kind of.

f54566b2-f18e-4cd4-bea1-03fb01bd1386-0
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.290
People they've captured from
somewhere.

7fb2145c-a074-40ec-90c6-f1fbeddce928-0
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.830
This is also a little bit of a
violent scene.

508239d5-ec6c-4bd8-a148-75c33d2e34c2-0
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.700
Being I don't really know it
says that.

a202670e-a197-46ce-a468-947a256e324e-0
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.164
Ohh shiver me Timbers. I don't
think this parents are very the

a202670e-a197-46ce-a468-947a256e324e-1
00:07:43.164 --> 00:07:45.740
pirates are very smart and I can
tell you.

4eaa6d24-fc40-40c6-a678-6432f8017ea6-0
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.600
That this scene is supposedly a
250 years ago.

eb5d0ee2-2785-4fc2-9dcb-98d119ee9e45-0
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.260
And it's in the daytime.

479bfecc-334b-44d8-ad7a-b40f899b765d-0
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.380
Because there's birds flying.

e6d1b4c7-e2ca-4e6e-8e35-f6e3cfd0344d-0
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.560
And it doesn't look too cold.

e06f5cb1-4e83-47d6-8cf8-31fc481c349c-0
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.410
I actually think if I look
better, it might be some.

f4d35417-fe80-4cd4-b4d8-f39c1bf72a82-0
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.670
God, I don't know if I want to
call him prisoner. There's some

f4d35417-fe80-4cd4-b4d8-f39c1bf72a82-1
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.700
boats with people that are
wearing the same color clothing.

0f99417c-f21e-4774-ae6a-22966203da5d-0
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.190
So they were like probably being
held captive.

f95cc4cd-b4df-47d8-a8da-729a080a3ecc-0
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.590
Our team of some sort that got
captured.

ed0c62ea-fb67-4b9c-adba-050aaf902121-0
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.983
And there's somebody jumping off
the boat that looks like they

ed0c62ea-fb67-4b9c-adba-050aaf902121-1
00:08:26.983 --> 00:08:30.245
don't want to be on that big
boat. They want to get out of

ed0c62ea-fb67-4b9c-adba-050aaf902121-2
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:31.019
that big boat.

34384389-7555-4cca-82a4-099bd1ba1a85-0
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.400
And get to that land.

8fd8f238-2bd7-4800-87b2-1cfdf698ff79-0
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.380
Uh.

2af05daf-cf8b-439c-a378-f37dc3b3c880-0
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.310
Any way they can.

54c16200-b6a5-4ac1-aa2e-4ad277ae6cdb-0
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.679
Our picture. You and me are over
a little bit of it, but I can

54c16200-b6a5-4ac1-aa2e-4ad277ae6cdb-1
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.370
see that the island goes up
higher.

88657b4a-1865-4193-a4b3-bbf5c54e94f7-0
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.560
And there is, there are the
little.

accbd1dc-8fba-4560-9a75-4fcd37aabd89-0
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.886
Boat people I think are actually
being successful in attacking

accbd1dc-8fba-4560-9a75-4fcd37aabd89-1
00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:56.590
one of the pirate ships, which
is very interesting.

4e30eeb8-e9e7-4097-af07-c815b6799aa6-0
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.409
And there's also a big octopus.
And you know, this octopus is

4e30eeb8-e9e7-4097-af07-c815b6799aa6-1
00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:03.900
holding on to people.

8a9a822e-bf34-47d8-9074-9858e69c79b2-0
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.816
Like maybe if it's a friendly
octopus, they could be helping

8a9a822e-bf34-47d8-9074-9858e69c79b2-1
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:09.820
him to the boat.

6e2d1287-81c8-4f47-8c96-fae068d2868f-0
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.208
But if not, there are. Yeah, I
think they're helping with

6e2d1287-81c8-4f47-8c96-fae068d2868f-1
00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:18.970
helping. Yeah, it's a friendly
octopus. Then there's some.

c6691535-f791-4a1c-9228-c15a8e9c47cc-0
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.790
Sharks, I think, waiting for
somebody to jump in the water.

f048d04f-c637-493e-8cf8-308847f3938e-0
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.558
Yeah. Oh, I see somebody
threatening to push somebody

f048d04f-c637-493e-8cf8-308847f3938e-1
00:09:26.558 --> 00:09:29.865
into the water. Looks like some
kind of king or something. A

f048d04f-c637-493e-8cf8-308847f3938e-2
00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:33.390
big, big leader is going to push
somebody in the water near the.

fc15bafa-0c35-4aa4-ba26-18e28f9141ae-0
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.550
Near these sharks.

d313ee77-f2c8-4af3-bc75-c4c26152e699-0
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.200
I think I need better glasses.

f5c670de-ddc7-4376-9ad6-a215b681e9e8-0
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.160
And is the

c6c89c79-b283-49c1-92d0-630cc6efe685-0
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.100
Think that boat going to go down
soon.

d6307a52-c837-40a6-b6c3-6d0b0c87fd68-0
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.038
#END_being_a_pirate And there's
just water being shot out at

d6307a52-c837-40a6-b6c3-6d0b0c87fd68-1
00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:55.030
other people. It's another place
I wouldn't want to be.

0535b35c-ece2-4599-8154-8078d19a68b5-0
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.440
{Well that was about 5 minutes.
That was good. Ohh wow.}

d4b9bcb2-c4c2-4019-8e02-dbb773d3c68d-0
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:10.120
{OK, OK. So we're continuing on
with another complex scene.}

d7593665-58b3-4069-978b-aa17bda98522-0
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.670
#START_airport OK, so I'm not
like all that knowledgeable

d7593665-58b3-4069-978b-aa17bda98522-1
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:35.212
about this character called
Waldo, but I do know about

d7593665-58b3-4069-978b-aa17bda98522-2
00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:40.251
where's Waldo and so this is
going to be a Waldo scene. It's

d7593665-58b3-4069-978b-aa17bda98522-3
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:41.490
also in a color

f5b2b444-b450-4714-ac49-7a816b57e1dd-0
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:49.045
book, cartoon characters book is
open, full spread ad and we're

f5b2b444-b450-4714-ac49-7a816b57e1dd-1
00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:50.800
at the airport.

3e41332f-4b08-4567-bc37-1ba1c67c9004-0
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.658
What's happened at the airport
is that a helicopter chopped

3e41332f-4b08-4567-bc37-1ba1c67c9004-1
00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.390
down all the flagpoles.

81104406-9e4c-4066-932d-0426d879c404-0
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.190
So.

f22147b0-4fe9-4b5a-8775-b24a25d4e750-0
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.072
People are in kind of a chaotic
state. They're running, they're

f22147b0-4fe9-4b5a-8775-b24a25d4e750-1
00:11:06.072 --> 00:11:09.160
inside the airport, their
luggage is coming down.

9fb6675c-cd26-46fc-b0d0-56bbe860326f-0
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.402
They're getting off the plane.
They're on the tarmac, they're

9fb6675c-cd26-46fc-b0d0-56bbe860326f-1
00:11:14.402 --> 00:11:17.000
on the buses. There's a fire
engine.

caa50ab2-ef52-4fda-99fb-fb434ba174da-0
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.741
There's a couple of other planes
that are just stable. There's

caa50ab2-ef52-4fda-99fb-fb434ba174da-1
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:27.064
even air balloon and a
helicopter airplane in the air.

caa50ab2-ef52-4fda-99fb-fb434ba174da-2
00:11:27.064 --> 00:11:27.849
There's a.

fa3355de-493c-4e9e-9c6e-c740fdad8f2e-0
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.507
What you call that blank? Blank.
What do you call that? Blind.

fa3355de-493c-4e9e-9c6e-c740fdad8f2e-1
00:11:33.507 --> 00:11:37.454
Not a blintz. That's food. You
know the Goodyear blimp, blimp,

fa3355de-493c-4e9e-9c6e-c740fdad8f2e-2
00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:40.963
blimp. The Goodyear blimp. So
what happened was, if I'm

fa3355de-493c-4e9e-9c6e-c740fdad8f2e-3
00:11:40.963 --> 00:11:44.911
reading correctly, there was a
smuggler that was caught hiding

fa3355de-493c-4e9e-9c6e-c740fdad8f2e-4
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:48.420
watches under his beard. He must
have had a huge beard.

1bc27e3b-2b7c-4f07-a302-fa21a3ea1b44-0
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.680
And a herd of elephants.

e0e7b884-8668-440e-ba80-4f3723319ff9-0
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.200
Was getting into a jumbo jet.
Now that is very strange.

379ef80e-9eff-4a59-b9d7-48e7b442d33a-0
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.850
We've got people transporting
animals in.

40222aea-ee6c-425c-8d4d-3e62e1a2a33b-0
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.680
I guess what would I call that?

d315130d-f75a-42e5-a790-f9ecb9804532-0
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.507
Not a pallet Jack, but a truck,
truck, truck, bed. And there's

d315130d-f75a-42e5-a790-f9ecb9804532-1
00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:13.959
people, as I said, getting on
the buses. oh one guys even got

d315130d-f75a-42e5-a790-f9ecb9804532-2
00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:16.020
binoculars watching the whole
thing.

c36c4d83-5ba0-499f-aae1-48273c0f30c0-0
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.467
So we got a lot of things
happening here. Some people are

c36c4d83-5ba0-499f-aae1-48273c0f30c0-1
00:12:20.467 --> 00:12:23.261
getting their luggage, some
people are going away. Ohh

c36c4d83-5ba0-499f-aae1-48273c0f30c0-2
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:25.040
people are flying paper
airplanes.

88f3a728-9046-497d-94f7-594daabd4428-0
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.650
And there's also.

fe55b1c1-aba7-432d-b831-cdf3ae18307a-0
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.881
Which looks like a fire truck,
but they're spraying water on

fe55b1c1-aba7-432d-b831-cdf3ae18307a-1
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:36.020
people. Maybe those are the bad
people.

957df764-d94e-44ad-ad5d-e91f63043615-0
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.960
There's a really old fashioned
airplane kind of like.

1998640a-445c-4bc9-8a6a-e0668cd56e72-0
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:47.123
I forget their names. You know,
the ones who created will, the

1998640a-445c-4bc9-8a6a-e0668cd56e72-1
00:12:47.123 --> 00:12:51.919
brother Wilbur brothers. And
it's got it. People are kind of

1998640a-445c-4bc9-8a6a-e0668cd56e72-2
00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:56.558
jumping into it from a cart.
Maybe they're thinking that's

1998640a-445c-4bc9-8a6a-e0668cd56e72-3
00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:59.940
their getaway. That particular
plane has a

d117078b-e02e-422c-86d1-315724dd8ba1-0
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.177
four of .four Spades, I think
it's four spades. Yeah, four

d117078b-e02e-422c-86d1-315724dd8ba1-1
00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:06.960
spades on it for some reason.

d7e778df-e8e4-4185-b22a-27fd8fcc0ef8-0
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.867
There's actually a lot of
there's also a spaceship in the

d7e778df-e8e4-4185-b22a-27fd8fcc0ef8-1
00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:13.080
sky.

9a70690a-783c-4c7f-8663-8a69d578cc5d-0
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:20.188
This is like all hell broke
loose at this airport. It's like

9a70690a-783c-4c7f-8663-8a69d578cc5d-1
00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:24.710
weird, like like a time travel
thing. Yeah.

fa0f46a5-9f0e-4f1f-83e2-710153508885-0
00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.990
Yeah, so it's kind of messy.

58758c1c-2559-437a-8900-401f29a03bee-0
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.919
Out of the three pictures, this
one I would deal with more than

58758c1c-2559-437a-8900-401f29a03bee-1
00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:36.588
the other two like reality. I
could deal with this because

58758c1c-2559-437a-8900-401f29a03bee-2
00:13:36.588 --> 00:13:37.770
I've done airports.

ec87b529-8a50-4261-853d-8d15dc484be0-0
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.220
Yeah, it's more common place.

0bd5e6b9-abea-47ad-ac68-0fc31afef622-0
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.860
#END_airport but very odd.

0b588a08-f82e-423c-bf25-eb9ccf781db8-0
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.480
{How long did I go now?

63405d45-28a3-4864-9a80-df5aa597b99a-0
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.672
About 3 minutes. So OK, this
one's a little harder to

63405d45-28a3-4864-9a80-df5aa597b99a-1
00:13:53.672 --> 00:13:54.820
describe, yeah.}

d79554b2-e88e-42f4-bac1-2ca7f52714bd-0
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.390
{Alright, so.

a6d98d2c-67bf-473d-a25b-e0cff74b1dad-0
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.500
Alright.

e20796cc-d5d6-4e8d-a1aa-b4575f9a2a2f-0
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.700
This is where we left off.}

19d337a0-88ec-41dc-b34d-39d92b11435c-0
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.560
{OK, another complex scene.
Again, just describe what you

19d337a0-88ec-41dc-b34d-39d92b11435c-1
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:09.900
see.}

3b725fd9-ab85-4e7c-b350-c31b22922e79-0
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.980
{OK.}

270188b1-453d-43d6-887f-e6958bbd4916-0
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.922
#START_picture_this Well, I
think this is also a Waldo book,

270188b1-453d-43d6-887f-e6958bbd4916-1
00:14:32.922 --> 00:14:36.606
you know. Where's Waldo?
Evidently he's a character that

270188b1-453d-43d6-887f-e6958bbd4916-2
00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:37.770
travels the world.

532d2fe8-b49a-4b72-8490-903576fc9eec-0
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.859
And it's again an open face
book, probably for children, and

532d2fe8-b49a-4b72-8490-903576fc9eec-1
00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:51.680
it's got a bunch of framed
pictures of what would be

1fdad2aa-6f8c-40e9-b3d7-10097fef7941-0
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.860
Characters he's met on his
travels.

6d1d8bed-f626-499e-9031-e1511e1e03e6-0
00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.876
There's animals, there's looks
like, there's people with

6d1d8bed-f626-499e-9031-e1511e1e03e6-1
00:15:00.876 --> 00:15:06.128
shopping and all I see like in
Mexico where they sell the hats,

6d1d8bed-f626-499e-9031-e1511e1e03e6-2
00:15:06.128 --> 00:15:11.297
they walk down the beach with
the hats. We've got just regular

6d1d8bed-f626-499e-9031-e1511e1e03e6-3
00:15:11.297 --> 00:15:12.200
old people.

5e7d99be-e8b4-4373-895f-561dc4e74e49-0
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.230
Like a man.

e9b96875-fc95-4ddc-90c9-7dd07492347f-0
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.530
Jungle person a cowboy.

5d579a8f-b6a7-40c3-8ece-da76db682fbe-0
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.839
Been to a lot of different
places. This Waldo guy, a double

5d579a8f-b6a7-40c3-8ece-da76db682fbe-1
00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:23.490
sided fish.

2bfdd94d-7534-4261-a6ee-368cf517cf4f-0
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.170
Oh, some some. What do you call
it? Sumo wrestlers?

7e540390-6434-42ec-9a52-162c192e0bf5-0
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.560
A man walking with a.

9897826e-6f2d-4570-b4e8-8dd319b26a94-0
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.270
Umbrella and a suitcase.

0711ff9f-f816-48b5-8146-f7fec4c9ce96-0
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.739
Or somebody got hurt. He took
the picture right when that

0711ff9f-f816-48b5-8146-f7fec4c9ce96-1
00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:38.800
person fell on the floor.

fbdd3693-91a7-4db0-9a01-8f4688b6fc5b-0
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.189
We've got some sports people,
we've got some animated cartoon

fbdd3693-91a7-4db0-9a01-8f4688b6fc5b-1
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:48.228
dogs. I don't know where that
would have been in reality, but

fbdd3693-91a7-4db0-9a01-8f4688b6fc5b-2
00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:48.879
that's OK.

eb8a06b5-337e-416a-8ebe-6230cbf924a3-0
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.120
Uh, we've got people on the
beach.

85d181e9-f0c4-4354-b513-b891d68c5fba-0
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.924
We've got other um not
unrealistic, but that's the word

85d181e9-f0c4-4354-b513-b891d68c5fba-1
00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:00.380
I'm looking for.

579bed81-27ab-4ae9-8ba6-cb8fe28d7160-0
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.000
Make believe, make believe
pictures of like.

74973f32-b0ab-42f0-b50d-24ec85817d9a-0
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:12.220
Man playing with a fish object
like a big old.

5a9c0887-bb4b-4b2d-a8cf-e999c6718702-0
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.497
I can't even think of what that
is. Crocodile. Friendly

5a9c0887-bb4b-4b2d-a8cf-e999c6718702-1
00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:17.060
crocodile.

27a14895-6149-498e-a696-493b99f240c0-0
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.660
We've got a man hanging over
some rails.

3772a6ff-30f2-47f5-b5e1-b3dddbf72b6f-0
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.950
They're supposed to be according
to the instructions or the.

60f9860b-933e-4b59-a277-6df75d8e1daf-0
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.489
Verbiage that there should be 4
characters that appear twice.

60f9860b-933e-4b59-a277-6df75d8e1daf-1
00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:38.964
Now that is going to be hard for
me to find right now explain to

60f9860b-933e-4b59-a277-6df75d8e1daf-2
00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:39.239
you.

a74b0cda-a014-409f-8f28-5447e80fae48-0
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.210
4 characters that appear twice.

c749a76f-0b97-4e27-80f4-a4ca1a861fd1-0
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.861
The funny thing I want to tell
you about is all these objects

c749a76f-0b97-4e27-80f4-a4ca1a861fd1-1
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:51.110
are framed except for two.

49839409-ac73-493b-94a1-5c1b530fe86d-0
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:57.557
One on the on the left side
looks like a bird. A tiny bird,

49839409-ac73-493b-94a1-5c1b530fe86d-1
00:16:57.557 --> 00:16:57.860
no?

7b27d07c-3945-491e-9288-5532b6c6096d-0
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.170
Nope, not framed. And on the
bottom right, there's a caveman

7b27d07c-3945-491e-9288-5532b6c6096d-1
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:04.890
walking.

b6087c4f-ea43-49a1-a381-02a36d851769-0
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.070
So let's see if we can find any
of these matching pictures.

3d746fd9-6991-4722-b22b-64247849cad0-0
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.300
Not going to be easy for me.

a7aac01f-aad5-4d7a-bc24-d850eaba63f6-0
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.990
Hmm.

effa02dc-9c00-404c-a1b6-86050884c783-0
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.810
The mishmash of all sorts of
things.

53b5be69-57aa-405c-9450-6075b58978dc-0
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.480
Reality make believe.

096e2588-f4d9-4628-8207-092b9d5bb6b9-0
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.920
Obviously things he's seen on
his travels.

e610c031-2883-4dd8-a1f0-cacc810840b1-0
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.910
Takes a lot of pictures.

27e50554-5af3-4221-95ff-f4f9cdd54564-0
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.975
Gotta come from Caveman talking
to each other. He's got a

27e50554-5af3-4221-95ff-f4f9cdd54564-1
00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:41.460
donkey, got upside down. I think
that's him. I think waldo.

917c4049-4a96-4b33-8dd6-76cc837fcf2f-0
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.580
Hair sticks up in the air and
he's upside down.

924bbe86-c548-4ef8-b12a-778ae204f531-0
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.480
Pictures upside down. At least
we have a running cacti.

14bb08ad-cdc9-4c99-beec-d9f06c6458e3-0
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.025
We have a bucket of water going
into blunt plunging into the

14bb08ad-cdc9-4c99-beec-d9f06c6458e3-1
00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:57.290
water it looks like.

66c59e5b-2ad3-46fe-9694-f2b906dbd11e-0
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.246
We have somebody who's got a
bunch of, I would call it

66c59e5b-2ad3-46fe-9694-f2b906dbd11e-1
00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:03.810
Fiesta.

7ec686b9-9832-4047-a6e5-58cdad389486-0
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.750
 either balloons or stretchy
things?

8837a257-277b-4582-80ec-32b96a962ec6-0
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.870
Like a party party.

e21e6619-ce8b-4d7d-8484-7510645702fc-0
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.790
We've got got a king sitting on
the world.

0530dd6b-2533-4caa-ac4c-4ef4c38205c7-0
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.690
With some kind of spear.

d40b0f2a-e82e-4f6d-bbb6-fef662516794-0
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.729
We got two people on a on a Jedi
jet rocket engine. Oh, and then

d40b0f2a-e82e-4f6d-bbb6-fef662516794-1
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:29.270
we have two kids that are in
like a little.

bf89dd46-6250-47fe-977f-18d57507776b-0
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.930
Little.

69c80af5-e7bf-4d97-b12a-ac4dca43d1b2-0
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.255
You know on the carnival where
you get in the cars, but it's

69c80af5-e7bf-4d97-b12a-ac4dca43d1b2-1
00:18:36.255 --> 00:18:38.790
not really a car, it's like an
animal, yeah.

f2bba5d9-d721-49e6-858d-89dafd661b43-0
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.610
{Got, got. I gotta get new

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.499
We got a tree. Oh my God, this
is so funny. We have a tree that

78c46645-54cc-4e4a-ac53-456c5902560d-1
00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:49.740
has eyes and arms.

495c47e0-1f0b-49a6-bd87-248b332e894d-0
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.040
And it's sticking out tongue.

c1668b1a-7fe5-4e8c-bb1a-ba8c88c56bbb-0
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:59.382
And we have a weird picture of
like a hand hand this four rings

c1668b1a-7fe5-4e8c-bb1a-ba8c88c56bbb-1
00:18:59.382 --> 00:19:00.860
on four fingers.

38f3a516-7c38-4e43-a7cd-51816d0f1fbc-0
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.068
#END_picture_this I'm still not
able to find any of these four

38f3a516-7c38-4e43-a7cd-51816d0f1fbc-1
00:19:06.068 --> 00:19:09.837
matchings very hard. {Yeah,
that's OK, you don't have to do

38f3a516-7c38-4e43-a7cd-51816d0f1fbc-2
00:19:09.837 --> 00:19:13.984
that. And yeah, you took about 5
minutes and towards the end when

38f3a516-7c38-4e43-a7cd-51816d0f1fbc-3
00:19:13.984 --> 00:19:17.000
you were listing what you see
was really good.}

760f16c9-8e72-430a-aa89-381e794af1fd-0
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.524
{All right. So that's our
examples of complex scene. So on

760f16c9-8e72-430a-aa89-381e794af1fd-1
00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:27.012
this study we also show another
type of pictures, which are

760f16c9-8e72-430a-aa89-381e794af1fd-2
00:19:27.012 --> 00:19:28.210
graphic novels.}

c094a2b2-dc8f-4bb2-9a65-4cb6e7f30da7-0
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.191
{And there are a series of
pictures that tells the story.

c094a2b2-dc8f-4bb2-9a65-4cb6e7f30da7-1
00:19:34.191 --> 00:19:38.928
Um, again, describe what you see
and what is happening. We're

c094a2b2-dc8f-4bb2-9a65-4cb6e7f30da7-2
00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:43.207
aiming between 10 and 15
minutes, but the stories, each

c094a2b2-dc8f-4bb2-9a65-4cb6e7f30da7-3
00:19:43.207 --> 00:19:48.173
of them have varying lengths and
I'll let you know. So the first

c094a2b2-dc8f-4bb2-9a65-4cb6e7f30da7-4
00:19:48.173 --> 00:19:50.160
one, it's about 5 slides.}

931c59a5-b0d8-4cd2-b338-408c0192e9c9-0
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:56.690
{Um, again, aiming between 10
and 15 minutes as you describe

931c59a5-b0d8-4cd2-b338-408c0192e9c9-1
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.980
what you see.}

18d6f7b5-9e97-412f-b9b9-155abd6cd4ba-0
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.930
#START_arrival-1 OK, what I see
is 9

d3ad4a39-651b-4835-bc4a-9b24e577045f-0
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.490
Old fashioned block pictures.

2ef8e09a-9d67-4a6e-9a0f-884cf14586e7-0
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.072
And it looks like a tic tac toe
board. That's how they're

2ef8e09a-9d67-4a6e-9a0f-884cf14586e7-1
00:20:17.072 --> 00:20:21.382
positioned. It's in a sepia is
what they call I believe. It's

2ef8e09a-9d67-4a6e-9a0f-884cf14586e7-2
00:20:21.382 --> 00:20:25.901
not black and white and it's not
color. It's kind of muted brown

2ef8e09a-9d67-4a6e-9a0f-884cf14586e7-3
00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:27.500
and what I think it is.

beedc45f-e285-4eb4-ab82-97e19587e452-0
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.300
Is.

c5d5e39a-addf-48be-9fb8-2489a42d2f02-0
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.910
Is each of these pictures is
depicting

9905ba40-c6b6-475f-b722-b7417e38185d-0
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.900
Taking the photo on the upper
left hand corner.

5c70c04f-ff3b-4e65-909c-eb8be6fbc71d-0
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.030
And then somebody picks that
photo up. This is a picture of

5c70c04f-ff3b-4e65-909c-eb8be6fbc71d-1
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.353
like an old-fashioned picture of
older people and a child, maybe

5c70c04f-ff3b-4e65-909c-eb8be6fbc71d-2
00:20:50.353 --> 00:20:54.011
like a like, what would be my
grandparents or my great

5c70c04f-ff3b-4e65-909c-eb8be6fbc71d-3
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:58.202
grandparents? They're taking off
a mantle and they're going to

5c70c04f-ff3b-4e65-909c-eb8be6fbc71d-4
00:20:58.202 --> 00:21:00.530
wrap this photo up very
carefully.

87d4b900-046b-44cb-b1b3-b7ce65860051-0
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.857
So you can see that there's two
hands taking something

87d4b900-046b-44cb-b1b3-b7ce65860051-1
00:21:05.857 --> 00:21:08.280
protective to wrap this photo
in.

1a8a806a-c743-4e50-8639-c653e9496d80-0
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.130
Or actually, it's not a photo,
it's a framed photo.

0d9e65ab-530c-4b3e-aa5f-1b823be93827-0
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.146
Umm, very old one. So in this
world, the 3rd frame, now we've

0d9e65ab-530c-4b3e-aa5f-1b823be93827-1
00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:23.046
gone the first one on the upper
left is just the picture of the

0d9e65ab-530c-4b3e-aa5f-1b823be93827-2
00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:27.640
older couple and the child. The
middle one is you're moving

0d9e65ab-530c-4b3e-aa5f-1b823be93827-3
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.693
right now that that's one in the
middle is the hand picking it up

0d9e65ab-530c-4b3e-aa5f-1b823be93827-4
00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:35.450
off the mantle, the one on the
very

1e32b869-4acc-491b-890b-f2f9515c9cd1-0
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.300
Far right on the top.

0879656f-d865-4f54-92ae-1afe7a3b62f2-0
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.180
Of this grid is the two hands
wrapping it up.

555313c5-b5bd-47df-b8dd-2bd3452c221d-0
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.823
Delicately. Delicately. OK, now
you're going to jump down to the

555313c5-b5bd-47df-b8dd-2bd3452c221d-1
00:21:49.823 --> 00:21:52.690
middle row of this nine grid
picture.

5acaf54d-d737-4f06-94a2-e5b0a355e0ef-0
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.260
In the middle left.

b43f5cad-cabd-4c6b-84e1-ca49bda6ea6b-0
00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.511
Is the two hands for this
individual very carefully

b43f5cad-cabd-4c6b-84e1-ca49bda6ea6b-1
00:22:00.511 --> 00:22:02.200
wrapping up this old

aded88e6-58ca-4a1d-86ab-42268077a3ed-0
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.240
Photo photo frame. He's tying it
with something. I'm guessing

aded88e6-58ca-4a1d-86ab-42268077a3ed-1
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.410
it's a he. OK.

338eed45-42ae-4908-9a8c-8c8ad4fec3ad-0
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.490
They are tying it up with some
kind of twine.

a14d4dae-b86c-4990-8da3-eaaeea6f91eb-0
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.327
And in the bow. And then the
middle picture showing that he's

a14d4dae-b86c-4990-8da3-eaaeea6f91eb-1
00:22:19.327 --> 00:22:20.350
tightening it.

7dfed409-f638-4ed2-84d3-09cb57878e8d-0
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:27.570
And it looks like he's preparing
to on the next slide.

d14a47a7-24ac-4b3b-a41d-415a1287473f-0
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:34.079
Open a suitcase that he's going
to put it in something to safely

d14a47a7-24ac-4b3b-a41d-415a1287473f-1
00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:35.290
keep this photo.

651b3f65-20c9-4662-98c9-b8460fd7e25a-0
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.775
So again, we're at the second
level. We're moving, we're

651b3f65-20c9-4662-98c9-b8460fd7e25a-1
00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:45.289
working down from this picture
if we were to number these

651b3f65-20c9-4662-98c9-b8460fd7e25a-2
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.990
pictures.

b5dea61c-0ae6-43c9-8d2a-2c90d2393711-0
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:54.212
123 across, 456 in the middle,
and 789 on the bottom. We're now

b5dea61c-0ae6-43c9-8d2a-2c90d2393711-1
00:22:54.212 --> 00:23:00.029
at #6, so I'm moving pretty
fast. I hope that I'm not moving

b5dea61c-0ae6-43c9-8d2a-2c90d2393711-2
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:01.650
too fast for you.

32a32fc4-b3cf-41f8-a16c-a244a60626c8-0
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.626
So for picture #6 we got these
two hands opening up what looks

32a32fc4-b3cf-41f8-a16c-a244a60626c8-1
00:23:07.626 --> 00:23:08.670
like a suitcase.

0a354767-4b70-498e-a1e3-55c179f17f8d-0
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.070
Or some kind of travel item.

30cc5fda-f209-4f1a-a32d-893609f70d15-0
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:19.060
we open it up and we're moving
down to what I call slide #7.

a843157b-aedb-4873-849e-3380a55233d5-0
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:24.546
He is now now securing this
piece of luggage with the

a843157b-aedb-4873-849e-3380a55233d5-1
00:23:24.546 --> 00:23:28.200
either, whatever, whatever it
comes with.

5784bd6a-2b18-444f-bc78-cadd2aa471ca-0
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.370
Some kind of locking device?

348e94ff-7bca-4b67-87a9-eb9592f08571-0
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:36.390
We can see that his left hand is
holding it down, holding down

348e94ff-7bca-4b67-87a9-eb9592f08571-1
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.210
this rope or whatever it is, and
the right hand is pulling it

348e94ff-7bca-4b67-87a9-eb9592f08571-2
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:40.580
tight.

7367139f-ceb4-4b2e-9b14-224231ac0836-0
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.083
Then you see that he's closed
this this device. So you're

7367139f-ceb4-4b2e-9b14-224231ac0836-1
00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:54.323
going to presume that this photo
that was being protected by this

7367139f-ceb4-4b2e-9b14-224231ac0836-2
00:23:54.323 --> 00:24:00.280
delicate wrapping and the tied
bow is going to be inside this.

2dc97345-e7d9-4769-8999-1ede55f99c98-0
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:07.073
Object that he's securing
because the last picture, which

2dc97345-e7d9-4769-8999-1ede55f99c98-1
00:24:07.073 --> 00:24:12.608
is what would be in #9 if you
went across these nine slides,

2dc97345-e7d9-4769-8999-1ede55f99c98-2
00:24:12.608 --> 00:24:18.416
123 across, 456 in the middle,
789 on the bottom right, #9 now.

2dc97345-e7d9-4769-8999-1ede55f99c98-3
00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:23.861
And he's almost like blessing
it. He's got his left hand or

2dc97345-e7d9-4769-8999-1ede55f99c98-4
00:24:23.861 --> 00:24:29.396
his right hand kind of on top of
this object that's going to

2dc97345-e7d9-4769-8999-1ede55f99c98-5
00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:31.029
secure this photo.

229c4baa-dacc-4d4e-854f-8165e8e6b4ad-0
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.394
This framed photo of his, you
know, back in the night, 1800s,

229c4baa-dacc-4d4e-854f-8165e8e6b4ad-1
00:24:36.394 --> 00:24:37.070
probably.

5a5016b8-2033-4674-b8aa-979c24b8f705-0
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.246
And it's almost like he's
saying, you can feel him saying,

5a5016b8-2033-4674-b8aa-979c24b8f705-1
00:24:43.246 --> 00:24:48.493
OK, now this is all secure. I've
taken care of this photo of my

5a5016b8-2033-4674-b8aa-979c24b8f705-2
00:24:48.493 --> 00:24:53.576
family or my family's friends
from way back in the 1800s. I'm

5a5016b8-2033-4674-b8aa-979c24b8f705-3
00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:57.020
taking it. I have taken it off
my mantle.

16e2c128-3035-4348-a52c-82a96bc0eb28-0
00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.640
I've wrapped it securely.

afcba175-10f9-44ed-b2dc-d90a8aa1b90f-0
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:05.536
I'm going to wrap it, tie it
tightly, but not too tight, just

afcba175-10f9-44ed-b2dc-d90a8aa1b90f-1
00:25:05.536 --> 00:25:10.746
tightly enough to secure that it
stays safe, and then I'm going

afcba175-10f9-44ed-b2dc-d90a8aa1b90f-2
00:25:10.746 --> 00:25:12.130
to put it inside.

8720c26e-7571-4b07-b53a-a3c660ac7e72-0
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.740
Another secure device.

61988a11-1f10-40cb-8b87-d1fce772b59b-0
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:20.160
Which is going to be hide it
from people actually, you know,

61988a11-1f10-40cb-8b87-d1fce772b59b-1
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.479
I mean I could be trying, he
could be trying to hide this

61988a11-1f10-40cb-8b87-d1fce772b59b-2
00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:24.910
object protected forever.

2f0e3a7a-b284-46f3-8a57-77d1dd951722-0
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.300
And he locks it in and slide #7
again.

2d2744c7-ba16-4f5c-9c7f-d472b4594b70-0
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.320
He's taking one hand. His right
hand holds the rope down.

08f09925-c5db-42ee-b95e-ee4e6dd9dbd9-0
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.314
So left hand holds rope down,
right hands and you know what's

08f09925-c5db-42ee-b95e-ee4e6dd9dbd9-1
00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:40.120
interesting?

9f62e19a-9c9b-4734-80e7-366f75d46e4f-0
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.590
How did this person take
pictures himself?

6ea0d4d4-5059-49cb-bef9-3ac5b063e7b5-0
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.010
Somebody else had to be here.

b13c55a4-151a-4c3a-b7c1-f4cf25f8191a-0
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:52.562
Yeah, so anyways, we're in the
slot #8 and he's shutting this

b13c55a4-151a-4c3a-b7c1-f4cf25f8191a-1
00:25:52.562 --> 00:25:56.590
case or putting it most pushing
the side. That's what he's

b13c55a4-151a-4c3a-b7c1-f4cf25f8191a-2
00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.687
doing. He's hiding it. He's
going to slide it under the bed

b13c55a4-151a-4c3a-b7c1-f4cf25f8191a-3
00:26:00.687 --> 00:26:01.370
somewhere.

01f5244f-7a4e-4ea7-876e-8a500889c945-0
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:08.021
And then adapted. The number 9
is where he's saying I'm done,

01f5244f-7a4e-4ea7-876e-8a500889c945-1
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:08.910
it's safe.

18f9a5fe-8042-474b-b7fd-2f8c8a214a61-0
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:15.524
Secure and only I am this
photographer know where this box

18f9a5fe-8042-474b-b7fd-2f8c8a214a61-1
00:26:15.524 --> 00:26:17.340
is going to be kept?

5ff69c00-83e2-4015-ae7d-5af94820385b-0
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.977
{So I still have about ohh, I'd
say at least five more minutes.

5ff69c00-83e2-4015-ae7d-5af94820385b-1
00:26:22.977 --> 00:26:24.630
Oh, we're going to move on.}

a4d10b76-0aae-400f-8af7-26f9fd9b1fa2-0
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.400
OK, let's move on. So this looks
like it's the same.

2b9d3936-1d0d-4649-b09f-1681d242e9c2-0
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:30.940
Uh.

ef60d70d-af85-427d-81f5-b6ffe117d0c3-0
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.420
Environment that these the
previous nine slides were from.

6d0c805f-608e-4cac-bac5-1a7fbd325de4-0
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.180
In this particular instance we
have

864d254c-a41f-4b54-86be-04701b6ba0d6-0
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:47.644
Again 9 slides on the left hand
side of the screen and on the

864d254c-a41f-4b54-86be-04701b6ba0d6-1
00:26:47.644 --> 00:26:53.300
right hand side of the screen we
have a what I would call like a

864d254c-a41f-4b54-86be-04701b6ba0d6-2
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:53.910
5 by 7.

b3c394d8-88fe-401d-86d3-249bf9207475-0
00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.929
Also the sepia. It's all sepia.
Still, this is the couple that's

b3c394d8-88fe-401d-86d3-249bf9207475-1
00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:02.610
a man and a woman.

0912765f-bcbe-400c-a994-0eaca228b8a5-0
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.152
We're on the left right hand
side now because this is giving

0912765f-bcbe-400c-a994-0eaca228b8a5-1
00:27:08.152 --> 00:27:12.063
us a much more clear picture of
what was happening in the

0912765f-bcbe-400c-a994-0eaca228b8a5-2
00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:12.670
previous.

7241a9eb-8e2a-4bbb-abb4-717d03909f90-0
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.800
Slides it looks like they have

e652e36a-c818-4b35-9a91-c6b70517db5b-0
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.920
Pulled out this luggage.

d3d6f514-23f5-4668-9132-e03cb9842bca-0
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.590
And they are either

3dc5d8a3-ef25-40e0-a854-ebabf675a7ac-0
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.340
Getting ready to pack it.

067d2e25-430e-40c8-9058-5691759a2b27-0
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.731
Well, they've already packed it.
My guess is that they have not

067d2e25-430e-40c8-9058-5691759a2b27-1
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:36.850
yet packed it.

c54964b0-7864-4724-80ed-3f126e55c68b-0
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.057
Because in this picture this 5
by 7 you can see several objects

c54964b0-7864-4724-80ed-3f126e55c68b-1
00:27:43.057 --> 00:27:48.410
on their mantle. There's a paper
mache or a paper. What do you

c54964b0-7864-4724-80ed-3f126e55c68b-2
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.960
forget what you call that? But

dcdb7419-b237-41e3-a0a4-bd69b921ff35-0
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.450
Origami.

0feb3ded-2cf2-4e83-a576-c045f62d806d-0
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.310
An origami bird, there's a clock
that says.

55070c77-a351-4e3f-9958-66e66f30309f-0
00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.190
10 after 10.

f85fe9e9-60ca-4c0a-a297-82c5a0ff8cbd-0
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.820
There is.

d60244f3-9a4e-41a3-b089-70b64bc04294-0
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.680
I'm looking to see what else is
on the mantle that they are also

d60244f3-9a4e-41a3-b089-70b64bc04294-1
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.060
on the.

f52e2ee6-43a0-4889-b1db-7bea942caba4-0
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.570
On the other pictures.

760cfa7d-dfef-47a4-af84-866dd5798857-0
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.480
Uh-huh. Below the mantle is a
man's hat.

42b1b820-a628-46e8-b592-be43b004bbac-0
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.360
And a some kind of clothing.

0d414a30-2e8e-415b-934d-7af9eff2352b-0
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.080
Hanging on hooks now, but again,
this is like back in the 1800s.

7bb0b7e7-8d40-4012-a6a7-cc75b4e3ad90-0
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.220
On the other side of us, under
the mantle, is some.

6327cbdd-158e-4594-8984-31fbd27c1ee6-0
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.280
Sketches that were made by
children.

50575e14-de45-4909-b517-df1ca9907cba-0
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.490
Or you would think it was
children.

64be3d88-4538-4470-8bdf-673210f85cd8-0
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.555
One of them I can barely see,
but it might be a picture of

64be3d88-4538-4470-8bdf-673210f85cd8-1
00:28:37.555 --> 00:28:38.750
that origami bird.

9af32b3f-25db-40f2-9cbf-6daef2e89631-0
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.510
Because one a little bit larger
sketching.

23fdfac4-3cf3-4719-a0a1-8e9e2b2b37a8-0
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.320
The black and white crayon.

7d071821-61b0-4ddd-b738-544402434498-0
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.930
Sketching.

a7b4491d-a7d3-4ed2-97cb-7584ae63e57e-0
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.087
Escape. Uh, I guess you call it
sketch. I was going to say some

a7b4491d-a7d3-4ed2-97cb-7584ae63e57e-1
00:28:53.087 --> 00:28:53.500
kind of.

829c4709-5db9-4f3b-a505-9e846f1fb66c-0
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.870
I don't know a pencil sketch
it's actually of.

fbd6dca5-a277-4524-bc23-c56c2ab9e69a-0
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.332
The photograph of the the man,
the woman and the child. So

fbd6dca5-a277-4524-bc23-c56c2ab9e69a-1
00:29:05.332 --> 00:29:09.675
perhaps the child drew the
picture. And in this picture we

fbd6dca5-a277-4524-bc23-c56c2ab9e69a-2
00:29:09.675 --> 00:29:12.840
also have the bird and we have a
sunshine.

5e0a03ed-060e-46a6-99ea-d11bce2767e7-0
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.870
And a heart 

72f09f42-c9ea-4147-899b-a4be9dd56fca-0
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.450
The reason I can see that detail
is because.

e4424dd0-cb67-4a03-9b24-ec58cbc2cc41-0
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.980
This.

c52a051a-7535-47ce-b42f-a5d2f813182c-0
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.590
Sketch is also on our.

20a69cda-42b3-416b-860e-b34352dea64b-0
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.510
Tic Tac toe board.

ac1c108f-8310-4217-a36e-f029c347b31c-0
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.050
Similar to the previous

6c801255-4abb-44f5-9082-fa6d5a8e9ac9-0
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.230
Example.

e92efaa6-6614-473b-beb1-ce05d70cd260-0
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.700
I'm probably confusing you, but
I'll go back.

bfc142c0-c9b3-4ee0-bec3-07e48dcec1b4-0
00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.810
Now this male and female are
about actually

09f2c3e4-981f-4e97-b108-2c6bb004238e-0
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.630
Late 30s, probably.

3ed42587-71c5-4b41-8d05-7c481b55cacc-0
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.244
And they're packing. They're
getting ready to pack this this

3ed42587-71c5-4b41-8d05-7c481b55cacc-1
00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:50.970
picture in this luggage.

7382fb1f-2457-484d-b5fb-bce815a6919f-0
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.820
Now they've also been having
some coffee.

4e622033-03c1-4124-9bd4-9b2aac3af04a-0
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.941
And they have a coffee pot. Or
maybe it's tea hot, whatever it

4e622033-03c1-4124-9bd4-9b2aac3af04a-1
00:29:59.941 --> 00:30:00.140
is.

f66c267a-d548-44bc-9972-0c1ef277addf-0
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.019
Some drink they're going to
share. OK. The reason I

f66c267a-d548-44bc-9972-0c1ef277addf-1
00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:08.620
mentioned that is because that
coffee vessel.

67655557-67b0-4391-9a63-85fc3a43565b-0
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.513
Is also in one of the
screenshots on the left hand

67655557-67b0-4391-9a63-85fc3a43565b-1
00:30:12.513 --> 00:30:15.190
side of the screen in our tic
Tac toe board.

62ad0039-20c2-4546-95c3-a456246ab7f0-0
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.205
So I'm trying to describe to you
5 by 7. That's giving me a total

62ad0039-20c2-4546-95c3-a456246ab7f0-1
00:30:22.205 --> 00:30:26.499
picture. And then on the other
side of the screen, left hand

62ad0039-20c2-4546-95c3-a456246ab7f0-2
00:30:26.499 --> 00:30:30.090
side of the screen, we have our
tic Tac toe board.

5070b28f-8700-4f6e-9688-c1516d04278d-0
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.080
Of specific items that are in
the big picture.

4cc2e302-1f96-4f39-b9fc-1ed425d0cb15-0
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.956
So I'm going to go back to the
tic Tac toe board and tell you

4cc2e302-1f96-4f39-b9fc-1ed425d0cb15-1
00:30:39.956 --> 00:30:40.360
again.

8e07ad38-f0c7-4181-9af4-edee5eb330f7-0
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:46.850
In slot #1, Upper left is the
paper mache origami bird.

f33173e5-e2d4-4a43-9944-40bc63720c31-0
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.630
The next one #2 slot is that
clock that said 10 after 10.

f3f558f2-46a6-4c89-8aed-a5c45c300573-0
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.973
The third one is a separate
picture of just that hat and the

f3f558f2-46a6-4c89-8aed-a5c45c300573-1
00:30:58.973 --> 00:31:02.540
clothing that I mentioned was
hanging on the

0f912d39-3299-489c-80b6-eb5af91d8bcc-0
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.070
Board behind them, behind them.
The mantle. The fireplace.

ec77d949-a684-4140-94c9-02177bc45955-0
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.210
Underneath the mantle.

b0f9a0ac-8cc3-4120-9ef9-472d26918b38-0
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:17.070
Now when we get down to slide #4
in our tic-tac-toe board,

4ba65759-4b5c-4288-9662-8b08fb4f012e-0
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.840
I see a pot and a spoon, and now
when I look more clearly at the

4ba65759-4b5c-4288-9662-8b08fb4f012e-1
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.930
big picture

04acae92-3c58-4d81-b42a-040b9b8d1ab8-0
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.456
That's a cooking vessel and a
spoon that's sitting behind this

04acae92-3c58-4d81-b42a-040b9b8d1ab8-1
00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:35.575
couple on a cooking place. Or
maybe it's a sink, but it looks

04acae92-3c58-4d81-b42a-040b9b8d1ab8-2
00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:39.230
more like it's a cooking area.
It looks like there's a

3f44003e-5ef6-49c7-9965-c872b1648ac4-0
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.660
Clay or something cement where
you could cook.

187fe43e-539b-4b13-bfc0-cb25a5e72110-0
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.560
OK, so follow me so far.

fcff2125-59fb-4a58-b035-95392adfcc02-0
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.749
In number 5 we have that
wonderful sketch that that that

fcff2125-59fb-4a58-b035-95392adfcc02-1
00:31:53.749 --> 00:31:57.220
we assume a child did. The
sketch that is

0ed2c02b-2079-4bea-81fa-747dd5c37cd4-0
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.432
Affect similarly of the real
photo, the photo of the two

0ed2c02b-2079-4bea-81fa-747dd5c37cd4-1
00:32:01.432 --> 00:32:03.760
parents we would think, and the
child.

c316fd7b-cee7-4b74-9c21-2304a5e16180-0
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.397
Moving over to the slot #6 tic
Tac toe board, we've got our our

c316fd7b-cee7-4b74-9c21-2304a5e16180-1
00:32:10.397 --> 00:32:14.370
ceramic coffee pot. This
actually has a crack in it.

edba9de2-a2db-48ed-86e7-7d54837499cb-0
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.420
Looks like to me.

610c5da2-1e4c-4c44-8de3-53c3d77a1dbb-0
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.580
Then we've got down to slot #7.

42b98c0a-e900-4d72-b2b2-79ffa097646d-0
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.044
I didn't mention anything to do
yet about this, but next to the

42b98c0a-e900-4d72-b2b2-79ffa097646d-1
00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:28.860
coffee pot on the table in the
big picture.

10cfe8ab-2625-4aeb-ba85-fd40551c0241-0
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.760
Underneath.

d3c085aa-ea01-493a-b5ff-5fc5eae9bf3c-0
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.631
The coffee cup that's closest to
the front of the picture.

d3c085aa-ea01-493a-b5ff-5fc5eae9bf3c-1
00:32:35.631 --> 00:32:37.560
There's some what looks like
money.

d0e7263f-d62b-43d0-85f7-3a74f3907568-0
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.660
So they're probably traveling
somewhere.

64b49f6c-ece3-40c4-9221-2cee5cd0b45b-0
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.080
They're definitely trying to
secure their items.

a9e58355-48aa-4cc9-a8b5-86f2304d082f-0
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.490
The next one is kind of sneaky
slot #8.

4e383653-17cf-4e32-ad9a-7fdd35de446d-0
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.560
You get to see inside that
suitcase.

842a9b5d-a603-4064-ae31-ff176996e7ef-0
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.851
Looks like there's clothing. I
can barely see the wrapped up

842a9b5d-a603-4064-ae31-ff176996e7ef-1
00:32:57.851 --> 00:33:01.952
photo. I don't see anything with
the twine wrapping, but I can

842a9b5d-a603-4064-ae31-ff176996e7ef-2
00:33:01.952 --> 00:33:03.710
see that stuff is in there.

2a428274-e597-472c-b123-7c6ca5055893-0
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:10.110
And then finally, what we get to
is the sepia picture photograph.

4f1297bc-6c93-4668-b798-b468e7a595fb-0
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.854
Of the the man, the woman and
the child, that was the picture

4f1297bc-6c93-4668-b798-b468e7a595fb-1
00:33:15.854 --> 00:33:17.570
that was being wrapped.

24af0bac-aef2-4d85-b55c-dceac9d34aad-0
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.150
So you got this whole

b11e4083-9ae2-44b2-b4b1-de0bff5eb93a-0
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.031
scene, but now you're getting
more information than you had in

b11e4083-9ae2-44b2-b4b1-de0bff5eb93a-1
00:33:24.031 --> 00:33:24.490
the first

c501e04c-08ad-48e4-9f2a-06767cb8d619-0
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.180
Set of slides.

45363f41-8bc6-4b3b-9063-08c675e44b0d-0
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.390
Much more detail.

170b5183-edbd-40f9-bce3-eea9f7cb7fab-0
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.140
I'm going to guess their they're
going somewhere.

271326d8-7b2f-41f5-bac6-9ae11461215b-0
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.570
{He's going to clarify what I
meant, so.}

f7baed20-4bde-4462-a5c9-e1a3cdc7b68b-0
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:47.357
{Let me just go back. So um when
I said five slides that means so

f7baed20-4bde-4462-a5c9-e1a3cdc7b68b-1
00:33:47.357 --> 00:33:52.512
this is 1 slide which is one
page that scan from the book and

f7baed20-4bde-4462-a5c9-e1a3cdc7b68b-2
00:33:52.512 --> 00:33:57.501
this is the second slide where
our two are two pages from a

f7baed20-4bde-4462-a5c9-e1a3cdc7b68b-3
00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:58.000
book.}

b8c45331-6261-45a3-82b1-ab215c250eaa-0
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:04.155
{Um, so graphic novel contains
multiple of these slides. So now

b8c45331-6261-45a3-82b1-ab215c250eaa-1
00:34:04.155 --> 00:34:08.850
we are two pages or two slides
into one graphic novel.}

f4a37a2f-a88c-42c6-9948-e9aac12da68d-0
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:14.187
{OK, right. So how much time do
you want me to spend on each

f4a37a2f-a88c-42c6-9948-e9aac12da68d-1
00:34:14.187 --> 00:34:14.540
one?}

c3a4c6c5-d368-456f-9dcc-2e74ef747305-0
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.511
{Which one will be slightly
different? Usually spend between

c3a4c6c5-d368-456f-9dcc-2e74ef747305-1
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:24.954
10 to 15 minutes on the full
item book. Yes. OK, so I was

c3a4c6c5-d368-456f-9dcc-2e74ef747305-2
00:34:24.954 --> 00:34:29.855
doing too much. Yeah. So OK, I
thought it was supposed to be 10

c3a4c6c5-d368-456f-9dcc-2e74ef747305-3
00:34:29.855 --> 00:34:32.229
minutes for each one of those.}

257b14f6-d892-4fd7-9ee7-f679b2d6f2ff-0
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.560
{Each one of these would be.

5fa9b1b7-5c40-4c58-804b-d35de862f641-0
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.300
One item that you do but.}

b1550303-0063-4dc7-a1eb-3fa4ca29c2a3-0
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:42.223
{There are actually multiple
pages of the same, right? So I

b1550303-0063-4dc7-a1eb-3fa4ca29c2a3-1
00:34:42.223 --> 00:34:45.457
can keep going, I can. I don't
have to expand on it anymore

b1550303-0063-4dc7-a1eb-3fa4ca29c2a3-2
00:34:45.457 --> 00:34:46.319
than necessary.}

66f30bfc-3c51-4a72-b0c3-7a6dd0aeaf4c-0
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.486
{It once. And you don't have to
go back and say, yeah, yeah, OK.

66f30bfc-3c51-4a72-b0c3-7a6dd0aeaf4c-1
00:34:51.486 --> 00:34:55.136
Sorry about that. No, no, that's
fine. That's why we do this,

66f30bfc-3c51-4a72-b0c3-7a6dd0aeaf4c-2
00:34:55.136 --> 00:34:57.020
which is made to make sure. OK.}

0e6e310c-4226-4829-bc2b-a0ba6fb94f54-0
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.430
{So this is the third.

c8ed1469-7492-4782-8ef0-411d7156b6a8-0
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.400
Section of this graphic novel,
and again we have.}

2de43cda-0d40-489f-a013-1fd11ea59815-0
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.590
{Like what I'd call slides now,
on the left hand side of the

2de43cda-0d40-489f-a013-1fd11ea59815-1
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.540
page there's actually 12 of
them, so we're dropping an extra

2de43cda-0d40-489f-a013-1fd11ea59815-2
00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.160
line in our tic-tac-toe.}

3b9ad313-b3bb-4705-b860-adcfe70a15c8-0
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.210
{And I'm going to describe those
first.}

fbc8269a-8b59-4918-ad8e-51634b2d6212-0
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.900
First one, we have a little girl
sleeping.

267af151-e133-493e-be40-468d2cedfde9-0
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.076
These are also the the Brown
pictures, the sepia pictures. I

267af151-e133-493e-be40-468d2cedfde9-1
00:35:30.076 --> 00:35:32.410
think the whole thing is going
to be like that.

91df3915-c1e5-4430-be1d-98013c5445db-0
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.968
The second picture of this
little girl is her with her

91df3915-c1e5-4430-be1d-98013c5445db-1
00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:41.481
opening her eyes while she wakes
up. The third picture is where

91df3915-c1e5-4430-be1d-98013c5445db-2
00:35:41.481 --> 00:35:45.430
she's really getting up. She's
yawning. She's adorable.

75a1b989-aa1d-4da3-93ae-ffa9cfd06b82-0
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.570
She's rubbing her eyes.

7bbed185-a2df-4939-86fc-26feb59f7aab-0
00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:54.306
And assuming she gets out of bed
and the 4th, 4th small slide is

7bbed185-a2df-4939-86fc-26feb59f7aab-1
00:35:54.306 --> 00:35:56.370
her eating her breakfast.

7b8d9fdf-eabf-47b0-bf75-16c46a4a5ba8-0
00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.400
Now she's looking to the left.

f43a3e20-c7fc-49d8-aa3e-0cfdc8a1b2b5-0
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:05.150
On the slide before she started
to eat her breakfast. Now then.

1b172d77-b1ff-4bb7-959e-08f22ac52933-0
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.652
The next photo is she's also
eating her breakfast, but she's

1b172d77-b1ff-4bb7-959e-08f22ac52933-1
00:36:09.652 --> 00:36:13.210
looking to the right and what I
believe is that she sees.

97b7e6c4-7b1f-4c5e-b8cc-0fdb5f6a1133-0
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.560
That luggage

214be4f6-08eb-47c9-b829-0fde61615a2b-0
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.560
And that and that's in the sixth
slide.

606245bc-2ac5-49aa-98de-65aa5dd64265-0
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.920
She sees

542c5307-691e-4355-86e7-ee0e3c9e01f0-0
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:26.143
Luggage. And then that we we see
in the next one down is the man

542c5307-691e-4355-86e7-ee0e3c9e01f0-1
00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:29.140
putting on his hat, the woman
putting on her.

a2c77654-1719-4e1d-bccd-a490f78d6a1e-0
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.800
Shaw over her head, which was
probably what was hanging on the

a2c77654-1719-4e1d-bccd-a490f78d6a1e-1
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.160
mantle.

159abc8a-f2dc-4b97-8454-17dbdbc9f983-0
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.274
And then addressing the child to
go somewhere, she's getting a

159abc8a-f2dc-4b97-8454-17dbdbc9f983-1
00:36:38.274 --> 00:36:40.140
warm hat on and she's helping
them.

00175b04-fa9f-4954-bce0-96908e28bd8f-0
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.640
The next one down, which would
be #10 now

f42c4918-6762-41e5-a707-a991d4a2772e-0
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.180
Is somebody putting on shoes.

3a2d470d-3911-4830-82e8-b361b959988e-0
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.133
I believe that would be the
woman because it doesn't look

3a2d470d-3911-4830-82e8-b361b959988e-1
00:36:51.133 --> 00:36:51.720
like pants.

e954e862-95d1-455c-aa44-a93649884183-0
00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.049
The middle picture there is the
little girl holding onto this

e954e862-95d1-455c-aa44-a93649884183-1
00:36:57.049 --> 00:36:57.510
luggage.

0396c51d-c5f0-494a-a560-d28d3d3da400-0
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.500
And the last picture there.

bb3ed2d0-095f-4464-acf8-d9544afbdb0d-0
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.492
Is the man reaching out to help
take someone's hands or the

bb3ed2d0-095f-4464-acf8-d9544afbdb0d-1
00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:10.751
luggage. Moving over to the
right hand side of the page, you

bb3ed2d0-095f-4464-acf8-d9544afbdb0d-2
00:37:10.751 --> 00:37:15.320
can see that this family is
walking down a alleyway.

64b7a0d7-8342-4b22-814a-f4d15538f6ac-0
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:17.760
In the old days.

6581485d-36cf-4090-abf8-e6043c2c2794-0
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.860
And they're walking all holding
hands, and we have the luggage.

2803d7a0-6344-4e51-a58c-037e1d178ae5-0
00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.505
The odd thing about this is
there's like a shadow of a

2803d7a0-6344-4e51-a58c-037e1d178ae5-1
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:26.880
dragon.

18dbb7b4-d52c-454c-9d9a-10527ea5946b-0
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.040
A Dragon's tail.

6cb2ea6a-3dc2-4c2b-97e3-31b7979a4b57-0
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.087
So I don't know where what where
this is or what this is, but

6cb2ea6a-3dc2-4c2b-97e3-31b7979a4b57-1
00:37:33.087 --> 00:37:33.810
that's kind of.

32039e74-5f36-44ec-8326-0f38036a8ba6-0
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.120
I don't know. Out of the
ordinary. Ordinary.

81c08633-6a29-46c1-a65f-25f679f0ea24-0
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.280
OK now.

4fcbbe83-63e5-40a4-ad98-310fc653e5c5-0
00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:48.158
We're going to go into the 4th
pace, the 4th section of this

4fcbbe83-63e5-40a4-ad98-310fc653e5c5-1
00:37:48.158 --> 00:37:53.107
book, and we see at the upper
left hand corner we have three

4fcbbe83-63e5-40a4-ad98-310fc653e5c5-2
00:37:53.107 --> 00:37:58.056
slides and then we're going to
have one in the middle that's

4fcbbe83-63e5-40a4-ad98-310fc653e5c5-3
00:37:58.056 --> 00:38:02.599
just like a 3 by 5 and then
three more down the bottom.

62645d1d-3098-44df-8f7c-7767102a143a-0
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.686
Left hand side we have a little
girl wondering what the heck is

62645d1d-3098-44df-8f7c-7767102a143a-1
00:38:06.686 --> 00:38:08.610
going on. Where are we going?
Why am I here?

7b3be989-d8fc-409a-a14c-d015eec13d87-0
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.526
Let's start the next picture.
After that, we've got her being

7b3be989-d8fc-409a-a14c-d015eec13d87-1
00:38:13.526 --> 00:38:16.731
a little bit more consoled. You
can see that the the holding

7b3be989-d8fc-409a-a14c-d015eec13d87-2
00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:20.040
hands more tightly. The third
picture of this little girl, she

7b3be989-d8fc-409a-a14c-d015eec13d87-3
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.140
looks a little concerned, like,
what the heck is going on?

6552d6c6-937d-41b0-80dd-867568ad7056-0
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.688
Um, but you can see what's going
on in this 3 by 5 in the middle.

6552d6c6-937d-41b0-80dd-867568ad7056-1
00:38:27.688 --> 00:38:30.497
There's a train coming, and
they're going to have to get the

6552d6c6-937d-41b0-80dd-867568ad7056-2
00:38:30.497 --> 00:38:31.280
heck out of town.

5bb50dea-3695-4b86-908e-539841eae3ee-0
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.986
I'm not sure yet whether they're
all going, but it looks like

5bb50dea-3695-4b86-908e-539841eae3ee-1
00:38:36.986 --> 00:38:40.532
they're almost saying goodbye to
this little girl in the next

5bb50dea-3695-4b86-908e-539841eae3ee-2
00:38:40.532 --> 00:38:40.990
picture.

e97fc234-aebf-4a50-a04b-a6bae7ff01d0-0
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:46.870
Uh, gentlemen, the next photo is
takes his hat off and he's got

e97fc234-aebf-4a50-a04b-a6bae7ff01d0-1
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.130
that origami bird.

8a049a0d-58a0-4b6b-a225-96ad47b8907f-0
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.280
She must like that bird, OK? And
he gives it to her. That's the

8a049a0d-58a0-4b6b-a225-96ad47b8907f-1
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.980
end of that left hand side of
the page.

7c0b9887-ea9b-49ae-b28c-83c3fb9dd7dc-0
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:01.009
Right hand side you see him
giving it to her and his hands,

7c0b9887-ea9b-49ae-b28c-83c3fb9dd7dc-1
00:39:01.009 --> 00:39:04.030
his arms around her and next he
gives her a hug.

64f3666a-2a6b-4b1e-b871-c3d8956371cc-0
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.450
And the next one after that,
she's looking at him.

247b8314-deb2-4fa0-b0ec-ffb73474eec2-0
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.787
Can't see him anymore. She
looked at him and she's holding

247b8314-deb2-4fa0-b0ec-ffb73474eec2-1
00:39:12.787 --> 00:39:17.476
up bird. OK, so now we're saying
goodbye. The next row of photos

247b8314-deb2-4fa0-b0ec-ffb73474eec2-2
00:39:17.476 --> 00:39:18.920
is the woman crying.

9055e279-758c-4ea0-97c3-a61f38b695e0-0
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.884
The woman hugging her, the male
with her hankie in her hands and

9055e279-758c-4ea0-97c3-a61f38b695e0-1
00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:28.920
the third one in that row is him
giving her a kiss.

be26bb7c-c3de-4082-8cd7-7f3c0430c0c4-0
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.470
Think I'm figuring this out.
He's getting on the train.

85b2b2f5-fb6b-485f-8205-e36f754b6187-0
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:38.534
He's going on the train and they
are. The next picture is all

85b2b2f5-fb6b-485f-8205-e36f754b6187-1
00:39:38.534 --> 00:39:41.869
three of them holding one hand
each, and then the next one

85b2b2f5-fb6b-485f-8205-e36f754b6187-2
00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:44.130
after that shows them separating
hands.

5a947136-00db-40b0-9c15-277ff134c1a9-0
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:50.250
Kind of sad. Train. On the way
you can see the smoke and then

5a947136-00db-40b0-9c15-277ff134c1a9-1
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.400
the train, you can see the back
of the train, the caboose.

77a59b59-dca6-4b95-8cfd-b1bacf857cc0-0
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.710
And then all you see is like the
smoke.

1229c448-4cf9-4120-acc8-98ea5dd6326f-0
00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.060
So next I'm wondering what's
going to happen? 

bc8032a6-d5b5-4c60-bc68-011c6200acd1-0
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.940
Ohh let's see. I think I know.

ed6e8d83-9c5b-4a37-9627-124bf9092aa2-0
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.190
This is when the man.

02a2c171-236a-4e7e-972c-208ce0f1492f-0
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.954
Ends up going to where he's
going. We've got another tic tac

02a2c171-236a-4e7e-972c-208ce0f1492f-1
00:40:13.954 --> 00:40:14.580
toe board.

0c70e0cd-7c1d-4e0e-8ce3-c5e8ba19e7a5-0
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.573
Where you can see that he's
unpacked, he would guess what

0c70e0cd-7c1d-4e0e-8ce3-c5e8ba19e7a5-1
00:40:19.573 --> 00:40:23.563
he's unpacked because he's got
his picture of his family. He's

0c70e0cd-7c1d-4e0e-8ce3-c5e8ba19e7a5-2
00:40:23.563 --> 00:40:26.350
got it sitting on top of what
looks like a.

0406cbb0-bc57-446b-9540-c7020023a202-0
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.410
Either the suitcase or a table.
He's eating some soup.

7313b1a6-6726-493d-8def-27d0eccea657-0
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.710
He's now looking out of what's
probably a submarine.

ab833e16-eabe-4afb-80c3-004c9634535a-0
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.424
And you can see him, see him
quite well in that in the first

ab833e16-eabe-4afb-80c3-004c9634535a-1
00:40:42.424 --> 00:40:45.160
window from the submarine, then
it gets smaller.

d2bd775b-77da-4b38-8379-c6500d2b060c-0
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.115
Then it gets to the next photo.
After that, there's only you can

d2bd775b-77da-4b38-8379-c6500d2b060c-1
00:40:49.115 --> 00:40:52.083
see three windows, so you can
see that this is moving away.

d2bd775b-77da-4b38-8379-c6500d2b060c-2
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:55.250
This is a graphic novel of him
going away to the war, probably.

7e279161-6872-48d5-9624-8f9c764bcb0b-0
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.300
Then you got us some photo of a
submarine with several.

1e36a622-0cee-4d6b-b611-f210d33f0c6c-0
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.995
#END_arrival-1 I don't know 12
Windows you can see this moving

1e36a622-0cee-4d6b-b611-f210d33f0c6c-1
00:41:05.995 --> 00:41:09.248
further away because the next
photo you can see more of the

1e36a622-0cee-4d6b-b611-f210d33f0c6c-2
00:41:09.248 --> 00:41:12.609
submarine and then basically you
just see a submarine and you

1e36a622-0cee-4d6b-b611-f210d33f0c6c-3
00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:15.700
can't really see the windows,
it's just really far away.

e9f5e782-0dbb-4004-92d0-7e5399ce8cbb-0
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.400
{Alright.

301846d8-c309-4ddf-9872-dbc9e7cf0284-0
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:28.090
So that was that part of the
story, yeah. How did you?}

791e3ca8-263f-4175-bfb4-34d9b069bdc8-0
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.779
{Did that feel OK? Do you
understand, like kind of how it

791e3ca8-263f-4175-bfb4-34d9b069bdc8-1
00:41:34.779 --> 00:41:35.230
goes?}

0079bea5-9263-4e59-934c-198ae8f5e4e0-0
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.046
{Yes. I was just trying to spend
more time than I thought I

0079bea5-9263-4e59-934c-198ae8f5e4e0-1
00:41:40.046 --> 00:41:43.718
needed to in the beginning. OK,
so now I hope I'm doing OK for

0079bea5-9263-4e59-934c-198ae8f5e4e0-2
00:41:43.718 --> 00:41:47.564
you. Yes, because you said isn't
this you're supposed to describe

0079bea5-9263-4e59-934c-198ae8f5e4e0-3
00:41:47.564 --> 00:41:49.080
someone who can't see it.}

eee24180-d44a-4703-8845-750f93e72bf9-0
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.050
{Describe what you see. Yeah,
just describe what you say.}

05aaa519-961e-4af9-9fb6-b8ccfc3f2b42-0
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.268
{So it's not like the first one
was like Waldo where I was

05aaa519-961e-4af9-9fb6-b8ccfc3f2b42-1
00:41:59.268 --> 00:42:00.810
trying to tell you about it,
right?}

e76add00-71c6-420d-931d-da01ca4fcccc-0
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:06.840
{OK. OK. I'll go more like to
myself. OK. OK, got it.

b60ed19d-7cd2-4204-9e1a-283f6ca99419-0
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:14.190
The other one just has three
pages. OK, OK.}

f1ae24b0-ac07-4912-9c04-fb2d42371a70-0
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.036
#START_arrival-2 All right, what
do I see here? I see again some

f1ae24b0-ac07-4912-9c04-fb2d42371a70-1
00:42:20.036 --> 00:42:20.230
old

0a8b6007-22d3-424e-be97-c5888c5209f0-0
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.350
sepia pictures could be
photographs, could be sketches.

116aaf5a-f03d-48f9-8fa7-4c0a5b61a01b-0
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.750
We start out with.

f614d85a-6cc5-45a2-abd1-2323fa54ae92-0
00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:34.804
What I think is the a couple and
maybe a daughter or son with

f614d85a-6cc5-45a2-abd1-2323fa54ae92-1
00:42:34.804 --> 00:42:37.790
luggage waiting to go somewhere.

bb24b9d1-84da-4f15-ba12-c4041d0e52b9-0
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:42.448
The next one is also same, same
idea. There's like these three

bb24b9d1-84da-4f15-ba12-c4041d0e52b9-1
00:42:42.448 --> 00:42:45.870
men with waiting with their hats
on and their luggage.

4e3d6ef3-b9ae-435d-b4b6-0d8720ab576f-0
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.448
Then you move over to the next
sketch. It's a woman's thing

4e3d6ef3-b9ae-435d-b4b6-0d8720ab576f-1
00:42:51.448 --> 00:42:55.666
staying with the baby. It looks
like the man is leaving. His

4e3d6ef3-b9ae-435d-b4b6-0d8720ab576f-2
00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:59.470
back is towards her. Looks like
the man then gets on a

8f2edffd-80b6-4982-a069-51fc8df427a6-0
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.850
Some kind of traveling? Not sure
if it's a boat yet.

000448b6-b2b0-4001-8117-06b0da7e8ebf-0
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.300
He's writing in a journal.

7b4c20f6-f5e2-4b16-8de0-1be3db6c566c-0
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.300
He's going to tear out a page.

5e85c6ed-311b-4d8d-9fb4-2a5d1ad32c9b-0
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.500
And he tears out the page and he
makes the.

cc8b6552-5085-4bf9-8b77-c93fd42ae8c9-0
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.920
An origami bird bird, just like
we were saying before.

4f484a4d-0d93-4f30-9be1-5084d9a7102d-0
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.620
And.

6d60f83a-2b8f-4f06-9c5e-3636955269e7-0
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.160
Looks like.

d29ced8e-16a0-41ed-9301-081f524a3a30-0
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.340
There's more.

a700576a-c86e-444d-bbd4-fe4b09ecb347-0
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.820
Birds gonna be made by either.

ed9bfc27-b27d-4d49-8627-efe260c2ea9e-0
00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.510
The other people on the boat.

9f68ad65-5d6b-41b0-be9f-332f60841030-0
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.550
For him, if he's the only one
who knows how to do it.

51996b79-56bc-4961-b31c-392771311ef2-0
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.040
We've got pictures of him
looking back and now all these

51996b79-56bc-4961-b31c-392771311ef2-1
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.510
birds.

9bd8ce9d-2d48-4b8b-afc3-7ef1a81171d8-0
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.890
Are up in the air. I think
they're on string.

eaffcb73-68da-4fd7-9313-ec8502004374-0
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.660
That's probably where that one
came from later.

58dfcf4e-185f-4a0a-9709-abd4a56cb933-0
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.880
Or could have been earlier.

3be2ceba-8f43-4160-a6e9-770f0b88da1a-0
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.230
But this guy evidently makes
paper birds.

dba2acd7-ba4c-456d-82d0-6bba315da27d-0
00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.380
OK, so.

41352c9c-f764-494d-bd53-89159ea43edf-0
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.714
This doesn't look like a war
scene. I mean, it's not a

41352c9c-f764-494d-bd53-89159ea43edf-1
00:44:03.714 --> 00:44:06.830
submarine anymore. It's like
people coming into Ellis Island.

4c95a1ff-f5e6-40e4-813d-083a15b0848f-0
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.001
There's a left hand side of the
page on the right hand side of

4c95a1ff-f5e6-40e4-813d-083a15b0848f-1
00:44:12.001 --> 00:44:14.869
the page, and I'm just saying
outside because it looks like

4c95a1ff-f5e6-40e4-813d-083a15b0848f-2
00:44:14.869 --> 00:44:15.300
New York.

868b26ae-590c-487c-8f3b-67331878279e-0
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.063
Looks like a bunch of people in
the late 1800s coming over on

868b26ae-590c-487c-8f3b-67331878279e-1
00:44:20.063 --> 00:44:20.590
the boat.

aeb21fbf-df6d-459f-b5a5-06b83162bc16-0
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.410
And there's some skyscrapers in
this in the background.

3d25f9ab-7471-4c3a-bcc0-05a2c381dbc9-0
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.989
And on the right hand side, I
can't say I'm all that familiar

3d25f9ab-7471-4c3a-bcc0-05a2c381dbc9-1
00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:35.384
with it, but this might be
people going to a country that

3d25f9ab-7471-4c3a-bcc0-05a2c381dbc9-2
00:44:35.384 --> 00:44:38.370
I've never been to. It could be
somewhere in Asia.

e6748231-3c6c-44c9-8a92-94c4dec88eea-0
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.670
You've got these big

d8623155-7778-44b5-ab8c-0ffe97475338-0
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:42.790
Ohh.

6fe928f2-a5cc-471f-abea-792d48bd6412-0
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.147
Concrete looks like structures
of something that you would see

6fe928f2-a5cc-471f-abea-792d48bd6412-1
00:44:48.147 --> 00:44:50.160
when you go visit somewhere.

ea1df89d-fa2d-4056-aac1-c5c0fd1bde34-0
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:51.780
But you know what?

bbd1368f-274b-4023-b17a-537924fabce4-0
00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.010
I think I might see in the ocean
there as people are.

bcf69df5-d5d1-4409-b2b5-9720395a87e1-0
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.870
Heading towards this.

af9b5421-815d-457d-8de2-df9d7a53aad7-0
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.460
Looks like a Jewish star. Maybe
other Christmas tree.

c7adf7cd-ef0c-4c20-9c19-0e340af82c67-0
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.102
There's lights in the ocean and
it's kind of weird. If it was up

c7adf7cd-ef0c-4c20-9c19-0e340af82c67-1
00:45:10.102 --> 00:45:13.384
to me, I would try and find out
what this picture is all about.

c7adf7cd-ef0c-4c20-9c19-0e340af82c67-2
00:45:13.384 --> 00:45:15.640
I don't know. It's got a bird in
it though.

9fdc43c0-8979-43e4-a041-56077cbc8789-0
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:20.720
Yeah, that's about it.

6b84efb0-92e7-4558-94ff-3530f1bb1b3d-0
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:26.242
Oh, that wasn't a Jewish star.
That was a clock. OK, so we got

6b84efb0-92e7-4558-94ff-3530f1bb1b3d-1
00:45:26.242 --> 00:45:28.850
this ship, big ship, and the
birds.

0e877853-66d2-41d5-b0d9-23319ddff8a4-0
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.220
And the buoys

4718b96e-5663-41cc-b3d0-66be770ec6f4-0
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.480
And we can see those people on
the.

08ce9d55-d771-4b0f-9551-dccde538aea1-0
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.780
OK, now we're going over to the
right hand side.

5d564888-9a36-47de-9e6d-d87fc8d2406e-0
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.758
And we see some of these people,
there's some of them look a

5d564888-9a36-47de-9e6d-d87fc8d2406e-1
00:45:42.758 --> 00:45:46.487
little concerned like they're
going to a new lands. We've got

5d564888-9a36-47de-9e6d-d87fc8d2406e-2
00:45:46.487 --> 00:45:47.750
one guy trying to be.

305c35a1-7e05-4bad-8196-99b9c7f3dfc1-0
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.287
Well, he's not trying to be. He
is actually the leader. He's got

305c35a1-7e05-4bad-8196-99b9c7f3dfc1-1
00:45:51.287 --> 00:45:53.140
a megaphone. He's telling him
what to do.

dfe2bae7-e7e9-440a-acf1-ae1899a39656-0
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.199
Here's a good piece of the
puzzle. They're unlocking that

dfe2bae7-e7e9-440a-acf1-ae1899a39656-1
00:45:58.199 --> 00:45:58.530
boat.

ce464940-1b7a-4b76-96e6-a3f5b6f8002a-0
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.800
Unlocking the boat. Getting off
this boat now.

6207c2f2-eaa7-4962-a36b-66adc2246d05-0
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.420
Man picks up that luggage.

6a7c751d-eda8-4e0f-bca1-837856240f1a-0
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.424
There's other men and women
getting off the boat. They've

6a7c751d-eda8-4e0f-bca1-837856240f1a-1
00:46:09.424 --> 00:46:11.950
got some food with them, they've
got luggage.

d2f7e0b1-c530-4933-9260-57fa4ccc9396-0
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.580
Men.

c26061a6-add8-4934-8cc0-ad1cfd92d652-0
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.806
You see them, actually, they're
actually descending from the

c26061a6-add8-4934-8cc0-ad1cfd92d652-1
00:46:18.806 --> 00:46:22.472
boat. You can see that it's the
they're going down the plank.

c26061a6-add8-4934-8cc0-ad1cfd92d652-2
00:46:22.472 --> 00:46:24.009
And now the final picture.

a7cdfda0-8b23-4f0f-b06a-8a32ad324c6c-0
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.420
They're all waiting in line

4fae3f1a-fbab-4efd-9f6d-8c5523864db3-0
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.170
#END_arrival-2 with their
luggage to get to a new land.

918275cb-ae82-4b76-b8ea-8da714b015d5-0
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.380
{OK, so that was the part of the
story.

111a6fc1-e4de-4adb-88a7-f4ba520ecf15-0
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.480
And we're going back right now
to complex scene.}

93af5810-08e7-4ab5-8dc7-7c3a50696333-0
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.630
{Ohh boy.

970fb781-0b30-4d30-b527-9a7a10eac88e-0
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:48.830
OK.}

952da501-033f-4b23-a636-7e65034574c2-0
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.700
#START_wild_west Oh boy, there's
a lot happening here. This is

952da501-033f-4b23-a636-7e65034574c2-1
00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.360
another Waldo.

f9004625-f40c-4a7c-97be-728fdea08ed7-0
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.568
Cartoon, cartoon, book and the
pages kind of fit together as

f9004625-f40c-4a7c-97be-728fdea08ed7-1
00:47:06.568 --> 00:47:09.130
usual. It's kind of expansion.

796934fb-6d4e-4811-93c5-3e1c094225cf-0
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:14.510
Is back in the wild, Wild West.
And while Waldo not only travels

796934fb-6d4e-4811-93c5-3e1c094225cf-1
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:18.508
a lot, he's a he travels in
different time frames. Remember,

796934fb-6d4e-4811-93c5-3e1c094225cf-2
00:47:18.508 --> 00:47:21.130
we saw him in different places
earlier.

6fedd885-9fdc-4899-9359-4d96984415e2-0
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:27.152
For a very far away time time
wise. So this is like the wild

6fedd885-9fdc-4899-9359-4d96984415e2-1
00:47:27.152 --> 00:47:31.115
Wild West and the gold Rush
which is coming more towards the

6fedd885-9fdc-4899-9359-4d96984415e2-2
00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:31.959
current time.

79fe048e-7359-4b5f-9265-1fcf266e21eb-0
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.787
We've got a hotel, we've got a
saloon, we got a general store,

79fe048e-7359-4b5f-9265-1fcf266e21eb-1
00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.100
we got another saloon.

e4732980-2459-4282-ba15-c8a7ddcc042f-0
00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.047
Oh my God, there's another
saloon. They just do a lot of

e4732980-2459-4282-ba15-c8a7ddcc042f-1
00:47:42.047 --> 00:47:44.750
drinking back in the day. They
actually have a bank.

e6040a89-531e-41cc-91b9-de1c32cf7ada-0
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:48.640
oh 1 more saloon! That's funny.
I caught on to that one.

8a43332a-5302-47f4-b574-3f33e0c97f33-0
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.090
Everybody can have a place to
drink, OK.

63ca6f92-06ea-4fc3-aa21-0a612577b9c6-0
00:47:54.770 --> 00:48:01.017
Got a bank, about 6 saloons,
Store, 2 hotels, hotels or hotel

63ca6f92-06ea-4fc3-aa21-0a612577b9c6-1
00:48:01.017 --> 00:48:02.630
as my grandchild

f32fc8d6-6ca4-4582-b402-d3f7fcd73b9a-0
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.350
Would say. lots of people.

d6d872f1-2c1f-40eb-ad68-206a0f9feb7f-0
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.160
There's horses.

b7c0a84e-4d04-44a8-a890-7a54847d56b8-0
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:15.466
And interesting the horse is
touching a picture of a carriage

b7c0a84e-4d04-44a8-a890-7a54847d56b8-1
00:48:15.466 --> 00:48:19.718
some, and there's lots of stamps
with like I don't know why they

b7c0a84e-4d04-44a8-a890-7a54847d56b8-2
00:48:19.718 --> 00:48:23.840
have these stamps in here. Maybe
that's how you mail a letter.

9d657db4-ec51-4daf-b1d9-4edbaad159fd-0
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.460
I don't know. There's a bison.
Looks like it's some kind of

9d657db4-ec51-4daf-b1d9-4edbaad159fd-1
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.300
animal that's no longer around
so and we've got wanted signs. I

9d657db4-ec51-4daf-b1d9-4edbaad159fd-2
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.140
hope that doesn't say Waldo it
might because like the thousands

9d657db4-ec51-4daf-b1d9-4edbaad159fd-3
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.860
of dollars from wanted for these
people outside the Sheriff's

9d657db4-ec51-4daf-b1d9-4edbaad159fd-4
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.280
Office.

9e177119-6f3e-4a44-8c1e-ac34ffecfbde-0
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.683
Umm, like I said, it's a gold
rush, so they've got gold mine

9e177119-6f3e-4a44-8c1e-ac34ffecfbde-1
00:48:48.683 --> 00:48:49.130
signs.

c7ff72ad-7e03-4105-b022-5aeb7c0f2249-0
00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.390
And people are climbing ladders
to.

1abf8b68-2f6b-4299-abbb-9305d38b051a-0
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.407
Because the the lie the livery
is unstable. I don't think you

1abf8b68-2f6b-4299-abbb-9305d38b051a-1
00:48:58.407 --> 00:49:02.480
should be on a ladder near the
unstable. There's a blacksmith.

5ce5414d-eacc-4130-90f8-0223bbefa5be-0
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.240
There's a guy fixing the roof.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.822
And just, uh oh, there's a
train, train, there's a train

e355bea7-a0bf-47a2-94b8-0b1c502c2f20-1
00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:12.790
coming to town. There's going to
be lots of people to go to those

e355bea7-a0bf-47a2-94b8-0b1c502c2f20-2
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:13.150
saloons.

the last one we do, but it's, we

00:49:30.245 --> 00:49:34.670
have 10 minutes and there's
about 20 pages. It's a story.}

husband was confused. OK?}

{Alright, yes, I can have 10
minutes. OK, well, we need this

e8bd7d9a-84ca-448b-9890-6ce8d3848a6d-1

That's OK. I can do it. He's

just he's just looking at.}

OK.}

increase my screen, but this is

6be22cee-c405-4fb5-a91f-95baca947707-1

another.}

{I think going to say a graphic
novel, yes, and.}

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:36.298
#START_journey It's it's it's
interesting because it's also in

336393d6-91a7-4ebc-a6d5-055689ba2e66-1
00:50:36.298 --> 00:50:37.310
that sepia mode

6f838c8f-abcc-4256-bda2-dc8c00e40b5d-0
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.969
 with the exception of 1 item on
the right hand side which is

6f838c8f-abcc-4256-bda2-dc8c00e40b5d-1
00:50:42.969 --> 00:50:47.179
scooter like I like not a kind
of scooter that you you put 1

6f838c8f-abcc-4256-bda2-dc8c00e40b5d-2
00:50:47.179 --> 00:50:49.940
foot on and then you use the
other one.

1ff200f1-19ac-47bd-839b-4b9d39850311-0
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.700
Move on the ground.

b854abcc-2a6b-4824-a27e-0744690c7946-0
00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:58.271
So what I see here is that this
book is written for somebody

b854abcc-2a6b-4824-a27e-0744690c7946-1
00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:02.786
named Josephine, and there's a
tribute to this Josephine. The

b854abcc-2a6b-4824-a27e-0744690c7946-2
00:51:02.786 --> 00:51:06.718
book would not have been
possible without the help of

b854abcc-2a6b-4824-a27e-0744690c7946-3
00:51:06.718 --> 00:51:08.830
great friends and that other.

567f09b5-6c4e-41e8-b414-890d163883ec-0
00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:15.016
And you can see on this picture,
there's some children playing

567f09b5-6c4e-41e8-b414-890d163883ec-1
00:51:15.016 --> 00:51:19.695
with their bikes. And I take it
back, there's a little bit more

567f09b5-6c4e-41e8-b414-890d163883ec-2
00:51:19.695 --> 00:51:22.620
color in this. There's some red
lights.

58c1d52e-778f-4618-b48a-f34acb6d5c2c-0
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:27.910
There's a kid holding something
that has some purple.

7806464e-c0d9-4d89-9639-3b319ef2e4c2-0
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:32.893
And there's a fire hydrant.
We're outside some kind of

7806464e-c0d9-4d89-9639-3b319ef2e4c2-1
00:51:32.893 --> 00:51:36.712
cement area, like outside, where
kids are playing out in the

7806464e-c0d9-4d89-9639-3b319ef2e4c2-2
00:51:36.712 --> 00:51:40.594
neighborhood, not really like
the playground or anything. You

7806464e-c0d9-4d89-9639-3b319ef2e4c2-3
00:51:40.594 --> 00:51:44.601
get over to the right hand side
and you've got this kid sitting

7806464e-c0d9-4d89-9639-3b319ef2e4c2-4
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.479
outside of a building complex.

aec188da-dce3-4f5a-8252-28ac2ce99789-0
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.700
It looks like maybe this kid is
sad.

b4c0a1d6-a3f8-41ca-99b7-cb19602f8889-0
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.211
Because the other kids across
the block are playing and this

b4c0a1d6-a3f8-41ca-99b7-cb19602f8889-1
00:51:55.211 --> 00:51:56.710
person's all alone.

4d101473-9a79-4919-b789-618404f65ee9-0
00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:02.341
And with the red scooter and
what I would think from the rest

4d101473-9a79-4919-b789-618404f65ee9-1
00:52:02.341 --> 00:52:06.632
of this sketch on the right hand
side of the book is that the

4d101473-9a79-4919-b789-618404f65ee9-2
00:52:06.632 --> 00:52:11.201
child lonely because not only is
not playing with other children,

4d101473-9a79-4919-b789-618404f65ee9-3
00:52:11.201 --> 00:52:15.492
but the family is doing things
inside the house without them,

4d101473-9a79-4919-b789-618404f65ee9-4
00:52:15.492 --> 00:52:16.600
like the fathers

1d57c4d4-a10d-4cfc-b45a-d8d1d119d1e3-0
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:21.305
On the computer, the mothers in
the kitchen, the living room

1d57c4d4-a10d-4cfc-b45a-d8d1d119d1e3-1
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:22.060
looks empty.

24e7b41a-328a-44ac-836e-6eede50ebf6c-0
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:28.551
And I can't see what's up in the
upper right because you and I

24e7b41a-328a-44ac-836e-6eede50ebf6c-1
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:33.979
are covering it anyways. So it's
OK. I can just that's where I'm

24e7b41a-328a-44ac-836e-6eede50ebf6c-2
00:52:33.979 --> 00:52:39.491
at right now. This this child is
a little lonely. OK, so the next

24e7b41a-328a-44ac-836e-6eede50ebf6c-3
00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:40.159
page is.

70fbc926-babf-4069-8ec6-75e871459c72-0
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.764
The child in the kitchen with
the mother who's on the phone

70fbc926-babf-4069-8ec6-75e871459c72-1
00:52:45.764 --> 00:52:50.008
and cooking dinner or lunch,
whatever it is, cooking

70fbc926-babf-4069-8ec6-75e871459c72-2
00:52:50.008 --> 00:52:52.250
something. Child has the red

9069fe35-8d11-421f-949a-d45f87a121aa-0
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.010
Scooter.

c566911d-d3e6-444c-9685-c39b04e86765-0
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.843
And she's probably saying, hey
mom, can you come with me? I

c566911d-d3e6-444c-9685-c39b04e86765-1
00:52:58.843 --> 00:53:00.970
would like to go out on my
scooter.

44e6f196-93a2-4434-a3e5-f4b4bd214eeb-0
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.060
Well, that mom's not going
anywhere.

389b98fa-7546-4ba7-8240-eae05b7e1552-0
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:08.160
Hmm. The next down sketch down
is the dad.

eb656600-2148-41fa-b8a6-c58aec14e24c-0
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:15.401
Just focused on his computer.
Little girls behind him pretty

eb656600-2148-41fa-b8a6-c58aec14e24c-1
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:19.470
much begging to go fly a kite.
Got a red kite.

4176ee7b-fac0-467f-ba0a-50746f54bead-0
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:27.290
And the next one is probably a
big sister, if not the mother.

51d47488-61a8-414e-892a-8956eb01b70e-0
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.320
Sitting on. it's a big sister.

42f0230d-7e40-4904-9167-3bca51695ac1-0
00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:34.852
On the couch with probably with
her camera looked like a camera.

42f0230d-7e40-4904-9167-3bca51695ac1-1
00:53:34.852 --> 00:53:35.550
little girl

ca56587c-e8d3-483f-9f1e-f5e5779d38f5-0
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.191
I can't tell what she's got in
her hand, but it's red again and

ca56587c-e8d3-483f-9f1e-f5e5779d38f5-1
00:53:39.191 --> 00:53:41.873
it's like she wants to go play
ball so she can't get anybody to

ca56587c-e8d3-483f-9f1e-f5e5779d38f5-2
00:53:41.873 --> 00:53:42.459
play with her.

6d94541c-c363-4f5e-a619-ade24bda712e-0
00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:47.135
So the next slide on the right,
she goes to her room and just

6d94541c-c363-4f5e-a619-ade24bda712e-1
00:53:47.135 --> 00:53:47.480
sulks.

df7bd446-58cc-4885-bfc6-e6475a748d73-0
00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.320
There's nothing red in here.
There's a cat.

2271a826-0d89-44f4-af73-e7155c8cf8e8-0
00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.180
Just sitting in her bed.

b1a81263-6449-46d1-9880-213333f4afb0-0
00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:54.920
Yeah, yeah.

435ff4fd-6b95-47d2-9be6-46c4f8904165-0
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.120
All right. So now what's going
to happen?

8dffb681-7831-489e-9f4f-c67f5acb88db-0
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:05.083
Left hand side of this book. Her
cat got bored and going outside

8dffb681-7831-489e-9f4f-c67f5acb88db-1
00:54:05.083 --> 00:54:06.120
the front door.

d8b1ea99-c241-4d2e-8989-65f22954d35e-0
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.790
He's getting ready to get up.

7c5ae303-8322-40f8-b11c-d6be9797a8f6-0
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.552
Yeah, she get ready to get up in
there. She sees paper on the

7c5ae303-8322-40f8-b11c-d6be9797a8f6-1
00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.070
floor and a red crayon.

6083db67-aba1-408f-8afd-e40d9396e86e-0
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.450
Kind of like the purple crown
that guy had in the beginning.

61159ab8-775f-4396-8f4c-0c8ad8f1aba1-0
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.490
She got up and she walked over
to those papers.

9989f51e-cc15-4d08-9010-e9b517f8a776-0
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.960
And this is so cute.

36a4e759-ea66-4783-b56e-eb59c7aaf2db-0
00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:35.790
She starts with the papers, but
she decides to go on the wall.

1283d897-cec3-4372-853d-002003fe6efb-0
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.960
She's drawing an exit.

4969f796-dddd-4e96-8665-be9ed91c2e52-0
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.480
He's going to leave that room.

cfccdbe2-7548-45f5-9108-af2f018f67bd-0
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:46.826
But not through the same door
she came in is her fantasy room.

cfccdbe2-7548-45f5-9108-af2f018f67bd-1
00:54:46.826 --> 00:54:51.083
She's going to go. It's got a
bright red and green for she's

cfccdbe2-7548-45f5-9108-af2f018f67bd-2
00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:55.131
outside. She's leaving those
papers. She's going outside.

cfccdbe2-7548-45f5-9108-af2f018f67bd-3
00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:59.040
There she is, her magic door,
going outside the garden.

e8b6a9b1-5621-47e6-9dcf-17f2e7630fa3-0
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:04.712
Or the park where there's lots
of lights and big trees and

e8b6a9b1-5621-47e6-9dcf-17f2e7630fa3-1
00:55:04.712 --> 00:55:09.140
she's free. She still doesn't
have anybody to play with.

e2e1be8f-3ca9-40d7-b599-d54cb7750e96-0
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:16.108
But she's out in the open. She's
got looks like a pond or a

e2e1be8f-3ca9-40d7-b599-d54cb7750e96-1
00:55:16.108 --> 00:55:16.650
stream.

f468030e-38b4-467e-81f6-7ab84e49b615-0
00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:22.117
And uh, lots of lights. Big
trees, big trees. Ohh, she's

f468030e-38b4-467e-81f6-7ab84e49b615-1
00:55:22.117 --> 00:55:24.640
going to do more with that
Crayon.

e1eecd8a-d3be-406a-b9df-4ef8a456e646-0
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:27.380
She goes out on a dock.

58c97fbc-9044-4891-8803-80c20e94ceb5-0
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:32.201
But there's still these
beautiful hanging fixtures and

58c97fbc-9044-4891-8803-80c20e94ceb5-1
00:55:32.201 --> 00:55:36.363
lights, and she's now going to
draw a boat. It's pretty smart

58c97fbc-9044-4891-8803-80c20e94ceb5-2
00:55:36.363 --> 00:55:39.720
kid. He's drawing a boat. It's a
canoe, actually.

b3a05c81-47c6-41aa-bd16-3c825f26a737-0
00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:45.673
She's laying down on the dock,
using that red crayon to draw

b3a05c81-47c6-41aa-bd16-3c825f26a737-1
00:55:45.673 --> 00:55:50.486
boat canoe. Canoe. Sorry. And
you know what? Once that once

b3a05c81-47c6-41aa-bd16-3c825f26a737-2
00:55:50.486 --> 00:55:55.540
that canoe is solid red, she's
in it. She's gone. She's out of

b3a05c81-47c6-41aa-bd16-3c825f26a737-3
00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.230
there. She's going to go to her
magic Castle.

ea7585ad-4086-4b88-aed4-8ffa4f4447c2-0
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.390
And the Castle has a Moat.

4e06618d-9e1f-4331-a4dc-9569c26f2826-0
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.050
Yeah, she's going to ride in
that castle.

f8b15656-7be1-47a5-97ab-c9747d7a9552-0
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.220
And I can't tell.

8c21683f-c458-4f27-8f05-38d1796e0d1b-0
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:11.779
There's other people. There's a
few other people there, yeah.

8c21683f-c458-4f27-8f05-38d1796e0d1b-1
00:56:11.779 --> 00:56:14.536
Not, not like a bunch of kids or
anything, but yeah, she's going

8c21683f-c458-4f27-8f05-38d1796e0d1b-2
00:56:14.536 --> 00:56:15.300
to go on in there.

57fb177b-f98f-4589-8f7f-2b9a89ebe30a-0
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.900
They're waving to her, I think.
Yeah, they are.

a59d4a9f-1e78-460f-9e59-90e0e64f0cc8-0
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.360
They're like, greeting her like
she's royalty.

8e9e15f5-91e1-4fc7-b894-5e8cdfa35fac-0
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.960
Yeah, but a nice fantasy
fantasy.

d760b4d8-f8ca-4da5-837f-7e19c5e6c885-0
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.750
Ohh no. What happens now?

21a929a1-507d-48a2-a343-c35144b81ac3-0
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:36.950
The

83f916ab-369c-4166-948e-7ad1151bdd27-0
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.164
canoe is going to go off a
waterfall. Ohh this is very

83f916ab-369c-4166-948e-7ad1151bdd27-1
00:56:42.164 --> 00:56:46.095
interesting and I don't think
that people can savor they're

83f916ab-369c-4166-948e-7ad1151bdd27-2
00:56:46.095 --> 00:56:49.961
either waving goodbye. I think
they're yelling out to her.

83f916ab-369c-4166-948e-7ad1151bdd27-3
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:54.286
Yeah. Hurry. No, no space. She's
just like complete like a water.

83f916ab-369c-4166-948e-7ad1151bdd27-4
00:56:54.286 --> 00:56:56.580
It's end of the bridge just has
no

670a9d66-ce9b-4f51-9664-ae754fdbf540-0
00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:59.180
Ending. It's just she just falls
off.

0e08995b-4740-4535-b664-0d7552d0ff49-0
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.880
And now she falls off.

cf6f41e7-0c06-4d9d-a67a-1e44a240329d-0
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:07.182
It looks like she falls out of
that red canoe and then she has

cf6f41e7-0c06-4d9d-a67a-1e44a240329d-1
00:57:07.182 --> 00:57:11.346
to circle back. She's probably
going to go back home. Ohh no,

cf6f41e7-0c06-4d9d-a67a-1e44a240329d-2
00:57:11.346 --> 00:57:14.840
more creatively she's going to
be in a red balloon.

9f5f0986-acf9-4982-a6b7-752c349cf620-0
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:20.264
And everybody's waving goodbye
to her. Yay. You got more

9f5f0986-acf9-4982-a6b7-752c349cf620-1
00:57:20.264 --> 00:57:24.827
freedom. She's in a red balloon
air balloon. And then I can't

9f5f0986-acf9-4982-a6b7-752c349cf620-2
00:57:24.827 --> 00:57:28.360
really see what's going on the
right hand side.

dfd9caf7-8375-4fd0-9664-1ceb59b62038-0
00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.520
But it looks like.

4e08b6eb-1d91-4f53-b6e4-bba775dd6b06-0
00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.230
she's up in the sky.

b470176a-5693-492f-be7d-37321c41c747-0
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.967
Can't tell what else that is,
but there might. She might be

b470176a-5693-492f-be7d-37321c41c747-1
00:57:38.967 --> 00:57:40.130
with other Sky machines.

fece3567-db0b-4545-b6e8-84df36ebf052-0
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.070
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

a5ad318f-d2be-4bcf-b5b7-348c57f17577-0
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.110
Yeah.

112932a4-77e2-47b6-9e36-b883236114a0-0
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.180
Other sky machines with.

9753e2d7-04cc-4b6e-a215-505266e4cfee-0
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:52.800
Someone's gonna capture a bird.
They have a bird cage.

4743f518-c31d-4b42-b750-bad282683965-0
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.890
They might be in a little
trouble, but I don't think she's

4743f518-c31d-4b42-b750-bad282683965-1
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.350
going to be in too much trouble.

cf8b6d04-74b3-4991-aed1-8e771b86f723-0
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:06.520
Ah, she's going to land on this
air machine.

77f0555c-43bd-4ec3-9f63-ed4e0e0aa62c-0
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:08.330
Where

29588263-f989-4b75-ac6f-64b1e4a1fdc0-0
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.070
they're capturing that bird and
bird cage.

9d980d36-dcfc-4296-b90f-7e5e4ad90608-0
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.930
And it's this is a fantasy
vessel.

b9659c52-23bd-4070-95b6-00549496f88e-0
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.650
I don't know much about these
kind of things.

d340e45f-fb0c-4b71-8173-4a85e605d1f5-0
00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:24.270
But yeah, you can tell.

fa1fbb20-0ee6-4798-a964-225096e01ec0-0
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:30.438
She's going to run. She got, she
got out of her balloon and she's

fa1fbb20-0ee6-4798-a964-225096e01ec0-1
00:58:30.438 --> 00:58:34.926
running down this air machine.
This vehicle that's in the sky

fa1fbb20-0ee6-4798-a964-225096e01ec0-2
00:58:34.926 --> 00:58:39.343
has found the vehicle and I
think she's going to climb up to

fa1fbb20-0ee6-4798-a964-225096e01ec0-3
00:58:39.343 --> 00:58:39.850
the men

05d6a9a0-5e30-46d1-ac30-9e0860d5dac6-0
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:43.510
Who were worried about her.

b129636a-d8fa-45eb-a6c8-a6133e34758a-0
00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:47.151
And the ones they had captured
the bird bird. Not sure if

b129636a-d8fa-45eb-a6c8-a6133e34758a-1
00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:49.673
they're the same ones as worried
about it, but they are

b129636a-d8fa-45eb-a6c8-a6133e34758a-2
00:58:49.673 --> 00:58:51.609
definitely the ones that capture
the bird.

e2d4589b-f2b6-4c30-94e2-6dd3a7ffebda-0
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.176
OK, now she's going to take that
bird away from them and she's

e2d4589b-f2b6-4c30-94e2-6dd3a7ffebda-1
00:58:57.176 --> 00:58:57.730
running.

cf5a607e-f2d1-4916-87e6-76f83d67fc1c-0
00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.620
even though they have Spears,
she's running.

3eb08a3d-762a-40a3-9fdb-7725b81e1575-0
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:05.200
And next thing we know.

a205e530-50a6-46c7-b662-d469eb2e13ef-0
00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.670
She sets the bird free at the
end of this vessel. Yep, there's

a205e530-50a6-46c7-b662-d469eb2e13ef-1
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:13.100
a bunch of other people inside
this vessel, but they can't see

a205e530-50a6-46c7-b662-d469eb2e13ef-2
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.150
her. The two guys with the
Spears, they're chasing her.

e6330342-7ff1-4dc6-88ec-479b3285f786-0
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.590
And that little bird is set
free, just like she was.

29782aab-3a49-4751-b534-53effb8ef8c3-0
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.292
And now they're going to drop
her down in that bird cage, I

29782aab-3a49-4751-b534-53effb8ef8c3-1
00:59:26.292 --> 00:59:29.784
think. No, it's not the bird
cage, some kind of other cage.

29782aab-3a49-4751-b534-53effb8ef8c3-2
00:59:29.784 --> 00:59:33.276
They're gonna, they have this
wheel and they going to wheel

29782aab-3a49-4751-b534-53effb8ef8c3-3
00:59:33.276 --> 00:59:37.059
her down. They're probably going
to put her back in her house. I

29782aab-3a49-4751-b534-53effb8ef8c3-4
00:59:37.059 --> 00:59:37.700
don't know.

06dcbdc3-bc0b-4f7a-92f6-2422a1e23347-0
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.650
Alright, here we are. She's in
this.

8d1c42c3-bfc3-4b6f-b1f1-29917f414fef-0
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:49.216
Cage that's being dropped down
off his air machine and the bird

8d1c42c3-bfc3-4b6f-b1f1-29917f414fef-1
00:59:49.216 --> 00:59:51.560
is now bringing her her red
crayon.

6e63493b-59de-455b-bd02-584e26e40404-0
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:56.120
He takes the red crayon. She's
holding on to the bird.

814ba300-1769-4313-93fe-cd3174cef5d1-0
00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.614
Is drawing something else now.
The bird is going to oversee

814ba300-1769-4313-93fe-cd3174cef5d1-1
01:00:00.614 --> 01:00:03.897
her, protect her. She's still
making this drawing on the

814ba300-1769-4313-93fe-cd3174cef5d1-2
01:00:03.897 --> 01:00:07.352
ground. It's a square. It's
going to be a rectangle of some

814ba300-1769-4313-93fe-cd3174cef5d1-3
01:00:07.352 --> 01:00:07.640
sort.

7dd400fa-cd31-45bd-a120-9c396032756a-0
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.390
Oh my gosh, it's a magic

315458f7-0fa4-4f15-bf08-386c5d4494ce-0
01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:18.528
Rug magic blanket. And she's
gonna fly to the sky out of that

315458f7-0fa4-4f15-bf08-386c5d4494ce-1
01:00:18.528 --> 01:00:19.410
cage. Over

404929bc-980e-4aeb-a70e-9cbe846d646b-0
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.240
All of this

074e41a8-ef9e-4fad-ab3c-30431aca7a13-0
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:26.002
Castle lands. This is different
lands. She's going somewhere

074e41a8-ef9e-4fad-ab3c-30431aca7a13-1
01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:29.650
else now, but she's on her
little red carpet and the birds

074e41a8-ef9e-4fad-ab3c-30431aca7a13-2
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:30.640
leading her way.

3066254d-eb65-49d9-bc04-1183d17d6719-0
01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:38.674
OK, so the red carpets now over
the the nighttime sky and

3066254d-eb65-49d9-bc04-1183d17d6719-1
01:00:38.674 --> 01:00:39.460
mountains.

76974355-4519-4c2d-861f-21114fe3e314-0
01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.210
And they're stars in the sky.

da88c690-7a67-477f-bf37-840933ca6aa8-0
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:47.754
she's following that bird, the
birds taking her to somewhere

da88c690-7a67-477f-bf37-840933ca6aa8-1
01:00:47.754 --> 01:00:50.380
where there's one palm tree
solitude.

fe88642f-00d1-4850-b24f-196fe27baaee-0
01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:59.128
OK, so she gets to the land. She
still got her red blanket and

fe88642f-00d1-4850-b24f-196fe27baaee-1
01:00:59.128 --> 01:01:03.600
her crayon. The bird evidently
has a home here.

96f427e3-261c-49a3-9529-f246fd611c55-0
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:07.500
It's in the tree in that one
single palm tree.

8fa5de63-4776-41ee-a98f-739295875af8-0
01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:12.614
So the bird is evidently asking
her to open the door. It's a

8fa5de63-4776-41ee-a98f-739295875af8-1
01:01:12.614 --> 01:01:15.480
purple door, just like the bird
is purple.

6e736803-9e98-4c40-beac-69d6d7da80b4-0
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.756
The open door that bird goes in.
She is going to follow that bird

6e736803-9e98-4c40-beac-69d6d7da80b4-1
01:01:20.756 --> 01:01:20.930
in.

a9437393-e1d1-4f30-b5a4-a66541cc9ac4-0
01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:25.340
Now.

e9558647-5421-4c0d-8331-1fbaa8872f06-0
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:30.223
Interestingly enough, the bird
comes out on the other end at

e9558647-5421-4c0d-8331-1fbaa8872f06-1
01:01:30.223 --> 01:01:34.800
the same place we saw the young
boy with the purple crayon.

d46e2137-1dc2-47d7-aa19-0281ecfe36d4-0
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:41.625
And the girls following the this
purple bird coming out of what

d46e2137-1dc2-47d7-aa19-0281ecfe36d4-1
01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:46.010
looks like a mailbox. She got a
red crayon. And now?

1ee52037-5aed-4bf1-abbd-9dd41b84e11c-0
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:49.050
That red light we saw in the
very beginning.

98ecd404-ec71-468e-a284-38fff18a67fb-0
01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.750
Is green and it shows that you
can cross the street.

52f6c8e8-8b82-492d-8a19-88d897228511-0
01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:59.140
So it looks like the girl and
the boy have now become friends.

159d06f6-36c1-4ca6-bed1-f3c02ebf7f56-0
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:05.490
With the Purple bird, the boys
now befriending the bird.

ea8470a3-8fbf-40fa-a784-5ffa05c678f0-0
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:11.169
She's making a circle with her
red crayon and he's using his

ea8470a3-8fbf-40fa-a784-5ffa05c678f0-1
01:02:11.169 --> 01:02:15.906
purple crayon to make a circle.
Let's see what's gonna happen

ea8470a3-8fbf-40fa-a784-5ffa05c678f0-2
01:02:15.906 --> 01:02:19.420
next. Ohh, they made a bicycle
built for two.

bac0b014-18b9-468f-bd72-a4295877ab3b-0
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:25.219
The interesting part is for me
is that the red wheel is what

bac0b014-18b9-468f-bd72-a4295877ab3b-1
01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:29.698
he's riding on with his purple
crayon and what the purple

bac0b014-18b9-468f-bd72-a4295877ab3b-2
01:02:29.698 --> 01:02:34.253
wheels, what he designed for
her, and she has a red crayon

bac0b014-18b9-468f-bd72-a4295877ab3b-3
01:02:34.253 --> 01:02:38.499
and she's the leader she's
pointing. Let's go forward.

7f46ef3e-50e7-4cbc-a739-7ddcd8430665-0
01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.330
#END_journey And the birds
following them.

2a85e01d-9236-4c78-b5d5-f036af4cdf5b-0
01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:41.760
{Alright.}

db5fdab6-182b-4866-90f5-214697cb91de-0
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.210
{That's good. That's a really
big guy. Can only.}
