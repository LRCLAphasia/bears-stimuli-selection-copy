00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.850
{I'm not full screen.}

d5c79ed3-b9e2-4749-924b-25484ace55aa-0
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.372
{OK, I'm not full screen. How
about now? Yes, thank you. Cool.

d5c79ed3-b9e2-4749-924b-25484ace55aa-1
00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:13.997
So the first item, which
continuing on is a complex

d5c79ed3-b9e2-4749-924b-25484ace55aa-2
00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:19.155
scene. Please describe what you
see and what is happening

d5c79ed3-b9e2-4749-924b-25484ace55aa-3
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:24.580
between three and five minutes.
This is really complex. So.}

d018c0f8-6b86-4e12-81aa-89ddb02f0d23-0
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.080
{Geez, it sure is OK.}

823d8d45-e573-400c-b07a-55a03b21eda3-0
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.334
#START_exhibit-12 So as I look
at this, I'm glad it has a

823d8d45-e573-400c-b07a-55a03b21eda3-1
00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:37.840
title.

215d8c13-69fc-4807-b0ba-98d5f3aa68d3-0
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.343
Great Portrait exhibition, so
I'm looking at a multi storied

215d8c13-69fc-4807-b0ba-98d5f3aa68d3-1
00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:50.190
building. At least three stories
that I can see.

5692c9dc-1ac7-4d4f-b2dd-cfc21035a6d6-0
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.680
And Umm.

5c316ba9-ed0d-4e9a-91e7-1a7c9f9f4bb2-0
00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.620
Maybe more because at the very
top on the left there are.

c2681677-2838-4857-917b-b92090f88c25-0
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.380
Uh, it looks like scaffoldings
that are coming from above, so

c2681677-2838-4857-917b-b92090f88c25-1
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.560
that would indicate it might be
a taller building.

05ee2d61-5d04-4953-ae9a-66223831f098-0
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.010
We're seeing a cutaway of the
building in.

c1fefa20-cf62-4fd1-a773-2c5c483bdac5-0
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.210
3 levels with balconies where
people can go.

fee54efa-f7b6-4107-b5f2-60c23e7a083e-0
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.470
Look down into the first floor.

a3cf6d07-72b7-4319-a1e4-e795de17c283-0
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.961
But since it's called the Great
Portrait Exhibition, these

a3cf6d07-72b7-4319-a1e4-e795de17c283-1
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:41.889
people are at an exhibition and
there is so much activity. We

a3cf6d07-72b7-4319-a1e4-e795de17c283-2
00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:48.008
have portraits on the walls, we
have portraits being carried up

a3cf6d07-72b7-4319-a1e4-e795de17c283-3
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:53.745
and down the stairs. We have
portraits being painted on the

a3cf6d07-72b7-4319-a1e4-e795de17c283-4
00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:58.430
1st floor and maybe in on the
2nd floor we have.

96825d80-5663-4eca-ba73-53f9d7b46e77-0
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.747
Uh, portraits in frames that are
small or large, depending upon,

96825d80-5663-4eca-ba73-53f9d7b46e77-1
00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:10.660
I guess, what they were.

3f2e4c7d-6607-43e5-8c0d-d580f7ad727a-0
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.680
The the size of the portrait
itself, whether it was half of

3f2e4c7d-6607-43e5-8c0d-d580f7ad727a-1
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400
the body, whole body, just the
face.

838a86cb-962e-49fc-8bc3-94fba8c0901f-0
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.408
So that that's very interesting
to see. And the shapes of the

838a86cb-962e-49fc-8bc3-94fba8c0901f-1
00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:28.270
frames are.

55928ad1-a78a-4c0d-8897-55b76543ddc3-0
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.858
Um, extremely varied. Some of
them have 3 portraits in one

55928ad1-a78a-4c0d-8897-55b76543ddc3-1
00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:37.260
frame, some.

24b035d2-99ba-44c9-b883-5dec6e284fd1-0
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.333
Some are arched and there are
triangles and rectangles, and

24b035d2-99ba-44c9-b883-5dec6e284fd1-1
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:48.040
some with fancy edges. There's a
heart shape.

2c88a1f5-5f18-41c3-9ea2-c1d1ed132923-0
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.410
Very, very much a variety.

e0ceb366-9f43-4b05-830a-e36451bd1bfd-0
00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.240
Over on the very left there is
someone up on a ladder.

2651ecff-c005-4124-bc36-de79721ac450-0
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.740
Pasting a large portrait like
it's a piece of wallpaper.

24cc2988-8785-42a7-91ba-c8d5d9b35937-0
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.593
And that's that appears to be
the largest portraits that

24cc2988-8785-42a7-91ba-c8d5d9b35937-1
00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.580
that's there.

915f5c6a-5539-40f3-91f9-2aaaf739f2f7-0
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.410
There are children, people of
all nationalities.

0a1838e7-65ab-4062-a952-3d0e9a2ac5c9-0
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.200
Um, people coming into this
building

f0651c56-2412-48ec-b031-b25b5f3cc5ab-0
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.419
From all kinds of places.
Apparently there are some in

f0651c56-2412-48ec-b031-b25b5f3cc5ab-1
00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.470
business dress, some in like
costume, like a clown costume.

f0651c56-2412-48ec-b031-b25b5f3cc5ab-2
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.015
There are people coming
apparently from the beach and

f0651c56-2412-48ec-b031-b25b5f3cc5ab-3
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:47.981
they're on the left hand side
and then if you go up up the

f0651c56-2412-48ec-b031-b25b5f3cc5ab-4
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:53.116
stairs and it's all an open
staircase. So this place is just

f0651c56-2412-48ec-b031-b25b5f3cc5ab-5
00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:54.800
crammed with people.

d6f7388f-b0e7-4808-ac27-d3c792369b3c-0
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.381
Every floor is crammed. Every
space is crammed. Every sitting

d6f7388f-b0e7-4808-ac27-d3c792369b3c-1
00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:04.493
place is crammed. People are
sitting next to the stairs on

d6f7388f-b0e7-4808-ac27-d3c792369b3c-2
00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:05.190
the floor.

f9ce1f7a-ecc7-40f6-b82a-d0d2963b0f21-0
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.690
And um.

9f1cd9e2-30e4-4fcb-ba68-c779b973fdb1-0
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.498
As as I look at all of the
different things that are

9f1cd9e2-30e4-4fcb-ba68-c779b973fdb1-1
00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:19.724
happening, one of the things on
the 2nd floor that I was going

9f1cd9e2-30e4-4fcb-ba68-c779b973fdb1-2
00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:25.160
to start with is that there are
two tall ladders, and.

df784c77-dbde-4dbf-8a54-343208af8789-0
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.899
They're actually using the
description of the page when I

df784c77-dbde-4dbf-8a54-343208af8789-1
00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:35.828
said exhibit 12, the Great
Portrait exhibition, as a wall

df784c77-dbde-4dbf-8a54-343208af8789-2
00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:41.012
hanging. And so those people
aren't even paying attention to

df784c77-dbde-4dbf-8a54-343208af8789-3
00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:46.281
portraits. There are people up
and down the ladder putting up

df784c77-dbde-4dbf-8a54-343208af8789-4
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:51.720
this big wall hanging that tells
about the portrait exhibit and

df784c77-dbde-4dbf-8a54-343208af8789-5
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.800
the people from the from the top
that are in a.

25d81502-5180-4b87-b71f-3bea6f82f29b-0
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.910
Scaffolding are also a part of
putting that together, so that's

25d81502-5180-4b87-b71f-3bea6f82f29b-1
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.250
kind of odd. And.

d05b961c-d967-427f-9154-d00c6bcea50f-0
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.444
#END_exhibit-12 And then as we
look over to, it's the middle of

d05b961c-d967-427f-9154-d00c6bcea50f-1
00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:12.966
that second floor, then you have
the stairs that are open also

d05b961c-d967-427f-9154-d00c6bcea50f-2
00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:17.057
going up to the third floor. And
it looks like there's a

d05b961c-d967-427f-9154-d00c6bcea50f-3
00:05:17.057 --> 00:05:21.723
scaffolding right at the top of
that that people are climbing up

d05b961c-d967-427f-9154-d00c6bcea50f-4
00:05:21.723 --> 00:05:23.590
and down. It doesn't make.

c6090faf-3b45-4d06-93a7-6e0109ee5dda-0
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.010
{OK.

d17d0ac1-3215-4935-8037-0332c0b4de93-0
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.020
Alright, so.

ada11e7c-1af6-46e2-834b-aa777100b9c9-0
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.600
Different ones, OK.}

e868c274-3605-4664-a047-a462c43314c0-0
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.040
{Slightly less busy.

713ae0eb-4a76-4c3f-9666-d58a2979506f-0
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.070
Um.}

c7227c47-2ca2-4edf-9de5-545377ea596a-0
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.160
#START_campsite OK, so this is
um.

b4764679-c662-4c38-b9f6-82ee507605bf-0
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.940
I'm I'm reading the postcard so
I know.

0c27fb66-36dd-41bf-84c7-75b473adabe3-0
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.690
I know what I'm.

d43e2e79-8263-479f-91af-067764cf20e5-0
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.570
Supposed to be looking at, but
this is not real helpful.

24d8d1a4-dd57-4755-9799-e0c6794c29ec-0
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.650
So this is.

dbfceea8-3f21-4711-bfc5-9449f829a469-0
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.565
A country scene and it looks,
it's southern, in fact it says

dbfceea8-3f21-4711-bfc5-9449f829a469-1
00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:17.260
north of the South Pole and all
of this. So I don't know where

dbfceea8-3f21-4711-bfc5-9449f829a469-2
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.685
he is, but he's in a southern
place because a lot of people

dbfceea8-3f21-4711-bfc5-9449f829a469-3
00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:28.471
don't have shirts on. And then
there's also a river where there

dbfceea8-3f21-4711-bfc5-9449f829a469-4
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:33.625
are mermaids and people on a
houseboat. And so obviously

dbfceea8-3f21-4711-bfc5-9449f829a469-5
00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.880
there's an opportunity to swim
and.

b00d6f32-e67b-4f31-8af8-62ff6067b5e1-0
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.558
To get into into the water, I
don't see any swimmers. Ohh no,

b00d6f32-e67b-4f31-8af8-62ff6067b5e1-1
00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:50.061
no swimmers. Yeah, shark fin and
a a duck and other ducks or

b00d6f32-e67b-4f31-8af8-62ff6067b5e1-2
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:56.670
birds and the mermaids, but it's
some sort of waterway canal.

b00d6f32-e67b-4f31-8af8-62ff6067b5e1-3
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:03.279
Along the sides everything's
very green and lush and bordered

b00d6f32-e67b-4f31-8af8-62ff6067b5e1-4
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.330
with bushes, but the bushes
actually.

1c34e524-1d57-43b2-8509-5d4e8382c6de-0
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.964
Are um, containments for the
most part. So they're separating

1c34e524-1d57-43b2-8509-5d4e8382c6de-1
00:07:12.964 --> 00:07:17.427
off areas. And I say
containments because it's like a

1c34e524-1d57-43b2-8509-5d4e8382c6de-2
00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:22.469
corral for a couple of bulls
over on the left or a couple of

1c34e524-1d57-43b2-8509-5d4e8382c6de-3
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.850
animals. I don't think you put 2
bulls in one place.

7a7016bd-ebee-4349-8246-bb3956fc9a9c-0
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.963
Again, there's the people are
dressed in all kinds of things

7a7016bd-ebee-4349-8246-bb3956fc9a9c-1
00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:40.432
and there's a lot of children.
There are some in some in

7a7016bd-ebee-4349-8246-bb3956fc9a9c-2
00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:46.189
costume, even the adults. I
think I see a Santa Claus and a

7a7016bd-ebee-4349-8246-bb3956fc9a9c-3
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:52.235
Viking and you know things that
are not a normal way of dress.

7a7016bd-ebee-4349-8246-bb3956fc9a9c-4
00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:58.280
So that's all on one side. There
are tents in another area and

7a7016bd-ebee-4349-8246-bb3956fc9a9c-5
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:58.760
it's.

878f634d-cf58-4e82-afc2-8ea04bc6bb63-0
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.804
Bordered by the bushes. But it
also is open onto the canal. And

878f634d-cf58-4e82-afc2-8ea04bc6bb63-1
00:08:03.804 --> 00:08:08.312
there's it looks like a park, a
camping park, State Park,

878f634d-cf58-4e82-afc2-8ea04bc6bb63-2
00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:12.586
something like that, where
people would be cooking and

878f634d-cf58-4e82-afc2-8ea04bc6bb63-3
00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:17.172
putting up tents and one tent
is, fell down and they're in

878f634d-cf58-4e82-afc2-8ea04bc6bb63-4
00:08:17.172 --> 00:08:22.146
various stages of putting them
up. All kinds of tents, big ones

878f634d-cf58-4e82-afc2-8ea04bc6bb63-5
00:08:22.146 --> 00:08:26.809
and small ones and pup tents and
one that looks like a tipi

f3cbb3f7-9527-4e44-a0b1-81feaba3976a-0
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.320
And.

5cf4dd34-58d5-44de-ad27-902cbfa7a22f-0
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.263
Then over to the right past
that, there's a walkway and I

5cf4dd34-58d5-44de-ad27-902cbfa7a22f-1
00:08:34.263 --> 00:08:38.632
see a hiker on a walk on the
walkway. It looks like someone

5cf4dd34-58d5-44de-ad27-902cbfa7a22f-2
00:08:38.632 --> 00:08:43.146
with a Golf Club, so there's
obviously other things that they

5cf4dd34-58d5-44de-ad27-902cbfa7a22f-3
00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:47.442
can do than just being right
here. So across the canal and

5cf4dd34-58d5-44de-ad27-902cbfa7a22f-4
00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:51.593
there is a bridge, an arched
bridge that goes across the

5cf4dd34-58d5-44de-ad27-902cbfa7a22f-5
00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:52.030
canal.

4a36ff89-4c80-42f4-b28f-fd3e8872c45e-0
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.330
And there is um.

a039d724-a03f-4ba6-9f5d-c24e1b15058e-0
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.210
It's an RV park.

8f176d81-08d6-4549-bdf4-494242caf22d-0
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.941
I don't see vehicles that have
pulled those RV's, but most of

8f176d81-08d6-4549-bdf4-494242caf22d-1
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:10.419
them are pulled behinds and not
the ones that you would drive.

8f176d81-08d6-4549-bdf4-494242caf22d-2
00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:15.550
So somewhere they must have a
parking lot. But at any rate

8f176d81-08d6-4549-bdf4-494242caf22d-3
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.854
that also is a contained area
and people are living in there

8f176d81-08d6-4549-bdf4-494242caf22d-4
00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:26.158
as well as in the tents across
the way. So you've got people

8f176d81-08d6-4549-bdf4-494242caf22d-5
00:09:26.158 --> 00:09:29.549
inside and outside of their
RV's, you.

46565336-689d-4087-ba25-70a792b0d618-0
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.400
Have them eating and preparing
to go places and.

dabd0442-d01e-43ac-a371-25152e1928bf-0
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.945
They have some animals with
them, so that is another area

dabd0442-d01e-43ac-a371-25152e1928bf-1
00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:45.872
where they can stay. There are
sidewalks all around that and

dabd0442-d01e-43ac-a371-25152e1928bf-2
00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:50.800
actually all around each of
these contained areas and people

dabd0442-d01e-43ac-a371-25152e1928bf-3
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.970
are fill filling the sidewalks
going from one place to another.

9ec5a3c0-13ae-41c8-a415-3a9fb398aab0-0
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.844
Over a behind the RV park,
there's another walkway, and

9ec5a3c0-13ae-41c8-a415-3a9fb398aab0-1
00:10:02.844 --> 00:10:08.276
beyond that there are just
fields and they still have the

9ec5a3c0-13ae-41c8-a415-3a9fb398aab0-2
00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:13.708
same shrubs and trees around
them, but there's nothing in

9ec5a3c0-13ae-41c8-a415-3a9fb398aab0-3
00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:19.047
them. So it's likely that it's
some farmland that's been

9ec5a3c0-13ae-41c8-a415-3a9fb398aab0-4
00:10:19.047 --> 00:10:25.041
portioned off. One of them does
have a a bull in it because two

9ec5a3c0-13ae-41c8-a415-3a9fb398aab0-5
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.570
people are running from it.

69108cc7-7bd6-4cc9-bac6-22d346b5fbac-0
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.696
#END_campsite And you know,
there's things going on there,

69108cc7-7bd6-4cc9-bac6-22d346b5fbac-1
00:10:32.696 --> 00:10:37.914
but a lot of it's just farmland
and it pretty much goes as far

69108cc7-7bd6-4cc9-bac6-22d346b5fbac-2
00:10:37.914 --> 00:10:41.310
as the eye can see. {So good,
OK, good.}

85bfb8f7-e14b-4524-876b-924735a6e57e-0
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.092
{OK, so we're going on to the
different type of stimuli. We

85bfb8f7-e14b-4524-876b-924735a6e57e-1
00:10:48.092 --> 00:10:53.545
have a graphic novel here around
11 pages, and we're aiming for

85bfb8f7-e14b-4524-876b-924735a6e57e-2
00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:57.210
between 10 and 15 minutes for
this story.}

e9acc7b4-e105-4cfe-aa56-f4e570a0f35b-0
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.020
{For 15 minutes I have to clean
my glasses. OK.}

266d79e9-c079-47da-a3a9-2b8cfe258453-0
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.340
{It's like, yeah, this is not a
real strain, but a little bit.}

f6872ee0-8f41-4e25-b46a-8a18b711e793-0
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:16.290
{Those little things especially.
Yeah, alrighty. Alright.}

6057acf7-061a-4a96-a76b-e697c39ffc2b-0
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.610
#START_flowerman OK, well this
is dark.

eb410d5c-8af9-4563-baf0-8e3072f0ed62-0
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.952
Yeah, yeah. OK. So double page
spread here. And so if we're

eb410d5c-8af9-4563-baf0-8e3072f0ed62-1
00:11:28.952 --> 00:11:33.080
looking at this as the beginning
of a story.

0f93da45-209c-40ab-984b-53619ed2af2c-0
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.996
It's definitely night time. The
things that I see right away are

0f93da45-209c-40ab-984b-53619ed2af2c-1
00:11:39.996 --> 00:11:44.733
where the lights are. So there's
an arched bridge with street

0f93da45-209c-40ab-984b-53619ed2af2c-2
00:11:44.733 --> 00:11:49.699
lights and a person crossing the
bridge and the person has a hat

0f93da45-209c-40ab-984b-53619ed2af2c-3
00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:54.207
and coat on. It looks like
there's a little animal next to

0f93da45-209c-40ab-984b-53619ed2af2c-4
00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:54.589
them.

131775d0-25d7-400a-98ac-e2d6edd5dcf0-0
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.943
They're heading toward the town,
but behind them on the other

131775d0-25d7-400a-98ac-e2d6edd5dcf0-1
00:11:59.943 --> 00:12:01.170
side of the bridge.

b259b094-e0c5-4ebc-a05a-bfae2d4e8a92-0
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.506
You can see that a car has been
driven or fell into the water.

b259b094-e0c5-4ebc-a05a-bfae2d4e8a92-1
00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:16.013
The water is what the bridge is
crossing and it's all very dark,

b259b094-e0c5-4ebc-a05a-bfae2d4e8a92-2
00:12:16.013 --> 00:12:22.520
so you don't see much about the
water, just shadows. And you see

b259b094-e0c5-4ebc-a05a-bfae2d4e8a92-3
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.826
this Gray car down at the bottom
and it is on the it is tipped

b259b094-e0c5-4ebc-a05a-bfae2d4e8a92-4
00:12:28.826 --> 00:12:31.930
into the Bank of this waterway.

6b900636-0499-4a39-96a1-29fef2ba5aff-0
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.540
Um.

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-0
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.076
Yeah, that person could be
coming from the car or they

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-1
00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:45.008
could just be noticing things,
but they are definitely heading

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-2
00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:50.019
toward the town now, on the left
side and in the background you

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-3
00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:54.716
see purple skies. So there's
it's either that time of night

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-4
00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:59.884
where the skies would still have
some purple in it, or we'll find

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-5
00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:04.660
out why they're doing that in
the town starting from left to

33c97ae0-ce97-4b27-a782-e5ff46234021-6
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.129
right.

a547a19a-2a51-49ca-a3b2-beb50817fb58-0
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.375
Uh, looks like there's a
carnival. And so on the left you

a547a19a-2a51-49ca-a3b2-beb50817fb58-1
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:14.044
have a circus kind of tent and a
Ferris wheel. None of it is lit

a547a19a-2a51-49ca-a3b2-beb50817fb58-2
00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:14.260
up.

891e90a0-bf4e-4554-adf3-b0f8cd68b879-0
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.687
But you do have it there. And
then there's a gas station with

891e90a0-bf4e-4554-adf3-b0f8cd68b879-1
00:13:20.687 --> 00:13:25.502
the word gas over it. Some
buildings that are a couple of

891e90a0-bf4e-4554-adf3-b0f8cd68b879-2
00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:30.400
stories high, looks like a
church in the background moving

891e90a0-bf4e-4554-adf3-b0f8cd68b879-3
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.464
to the right there is a a bar
and it says bar. And then over

891e90a0-bf4e-4554-adf3-b0f8cd68b879-4
00:13:35.464 --> 00:13:40.611
to the right again there's a
truck that is parked in front of

891e90a0-bf4e-4554-adf3-b0f8cd68b879-5
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:45.509
the bait shop and the bait shop
has a second or maybe 1/3.

289ec55d-0fe6-4d18-8008-a83c66215245-0
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.670
Story as well. So someone
probably lives above it, and

289ec55d-0fe6-4d18-8008-a83c66215245-1
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.080
then as you keep on going and
it's still dark, nothing appears

289ec55d-0fe6-4d18-8008-a83c66215245-2
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.850
to be open.

ad5d554d-7080-4167-84ad-fa46c6777299-0
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.056
And it looks like there's a
couple of people in the shadows

ad5d554d-7080-4167-84ad-fa46c6777299-1
00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:03.946
that are, it looks like they're
just walking and it's kind of a

ad5d554d-7080-4167-84ad-fa46c6777299-2
00:14:03.946 --> 00:14:05.040
cobblestone street

64805d35-4d8c-40e9-9098-218e39d5f741-0
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.404
OK, we still see this person
walking and everything still

64805d35-4d8c-40e9-9098-218e39d5f741-1
00:14:16.404 --> 00:14:21.457
dark, but it appears now that we
really are at a sunset time

64805d35-4d8c-40e9-9098-218e39d5f741-2
00:14:21.457 --> 00:14:26.178
because in the background
there's just a little piece of

64805d35-4d8c-40e9-9098-218e39d5f741-3
00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:31.314
sunset kind of left. So this
person has walked into the town.

64805d35-4d8c-40e9-9098-218e39d5f741-4
00:14:31.314 --> 00:14:36.781
I don't see anything that we saw
in the other picture, so they're

64805d35-4d8c-40e9-9098-218e39d5f741-5
00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:37.610
past that.

e3d62ac1-ada6-49a9-b2f1-239029a2e5ca-0
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.164
It looks like they're walking
past and I can't read it from

e3d62ac1-ada6-49a9-b2f1-239029a2e5ca-1
00:14:43.164 --> 00:14:46.783
here, but some sort of gym
because up at the top it looks

e3d62ac1-ada6-49a9-b2f1-239029a2e5ca-2
00:14:46.783 --> 00:14:50.840
like people might be boxing, but
I don't know, I could be wrong.

f1984cb9-0194-4560-80a2-4ffa1fc1af87-0
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.733
This person is at the street
light and uh, looks like it's

f1984cb9-0194-4560-80a2-4ffa1fc1af87-1
00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:04.546
going to turn to their their
right, and immediately on the

f1984cb9-0194-4560-80a2-4ffa1fc1af87-2
00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:10.260
right is a a tall house with a
big entry door. Past that,

f1984cb9-0194-4560-80a2-4ffa1fc1af87-3
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:16.270
there's a couple of people that
look like they might just be

f1984cb9-0194-4560-80a2-4ffa1fc1af87-4
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.340
neighbors. He's in a.

269cf6d3-5556-4d30-b5e5-bcfdedd2e0a5-0
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:24.837
a sleeveless undershirt, and
they're just standing there, but

269cf6d3-5556-4d30-b5e5-bcfdedd2e0a5-1
00:15:24.837 --> 00:15:29.679
you can see their faces. And
then if you, if we're looking

269cf6d3-5556-4d30-b5e5-bcfdedd2e0a5-2
00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:34.684
straight ahead of the person
that's walking, there's another

269cf6d3-5556-4d30-b5e5-bcfdedd2e0a5-3
00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:40.018
street light that's illuminating
a little bit of the street. And

269cf6d3-5556-4d30-b5e5-bcfdedd2e0a5-4
00:15:40.018 --> 00:15:44.942
you can see activity in the in
the houses, you can see that

269cf6d3-5556-4d30-b5e5-bcfdedd2e0a5-5
00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:50.030
there's people in the houses,
there's a statue in the middle.

82424f70-a56a-4e33-ac91-577d6ffb139f-0
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.090
Of this. Uh.

ab06aa28-93c8-4953-a9ef-92e6cf04cb92-0
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:58.729
It's probably an intersection.
It might be a like a roundabout,

ab06aa28-93c8-4953-a9ef-92e6cf04cb92-1
00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:04.438
but there's a statue of someone
on a horse, looks like they're

ab06aa28-93c8-4953-a9ef-92e6cf04cb92-2
00:16:04.438 --> 00:16:10.056
brandishing a a sword of some
sort. And the only thing that's

ab06aa28-93c8-4953-a9ef-92e6cf04cb92-3
00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:13.500
really lit up by the street
light is.

ea5dc539-d13f-45d8-9e58-9adebca66484-0
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.121
Part of the intersection and a
person in a car that's driving

ea5dc539-d13f-45d8-9e58-9adebca66484-1
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:22.640
toward where the person is
standing and walking.

2161b605-6c19-45ff-a121-d9e9fbb908ee-0
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.601
So if we're back to where the
person is and where they're

2161b605-6c19-45ff-a121-d9e9fbb908ee-1
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:35.940
facing, it's a building that has
people in it, but it's very dark

2161b605-6c19-45ff-a121-d9e9fbb908ee-2
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.713
and you can hardly see anything.
There is a cafe and a man

2161b605-6c19-45ff-a121-d9e9fbb908ee-3
00:16:40.713 --> 00:16:45.324
standing under the cafe sign,
which is right next to the

2161b605-6c19-45ff-a121-d9e9fbb908ee-4
00:16:45.324 --> 00:16:46.700
street light and.

2e6fcb42-c1a9-4be2-867e-238e3d31fc41-0
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.965
It looks like there's apartments
up above because there's a

2e6fcb42-c1a9-4be2-867e-238e3d31fc41-1
00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:55.730
number of people in it. It
doesn't look like they're just

2e6fcb42-c1a9-4be2-867e-238e3d31fc41-2
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.120
dining

fdf9377d-7c95-4844-9012-a92e35ab2b7d-0
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.903
Alright, so now I guess this
person is approaching the place

fdf9377d-7c95-4844-9012-a92e35ab2b7d-1
00:17:06.903 --> 00:17:11.316
where they expected to go. Umm,
there's nothing else familiar.

fdf9377d-7c95-4844-9012-a92e35ab2b7d-2
00:17:11.316 --> 00:17:15.660
So they are continuing into the
town to get to the house they

fdf9377d-7c95-4844-9012-a92e35ab2b7d-3
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.723
want to go to. On the left,
there's some sort of building

fdf9377d-7c95-4844-9012-a92e35ab2b7d-4
00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:24.207
with advertisements on it. Even
though it looks like someone is

fdf9377d-7c95-4844-9012-a92e35ab2b7d-5
00:17:24.207 --> 00:17:27.640
living in it, it might be an
apartment building.

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-0
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.720
Three stories. The House that
this person is approaching and

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-1
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.610
and and I guess I'm going to say
that it's a man now I see it

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-2
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.578
more clearly blue hat and like a
gold colored suit and I still

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-3
00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:47.626
see a little animal down by him
probably a dog and he's walking

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-4
00:17:47.626 --> 00:17:52.436
up toward this house that has a
like a circular drive and or

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-5
00:17:52.436 --> 00:17:57.484
semi circular and the house is 3
stories and there's someone or

b54cac16-52e6-4319-bfe8-41cd25451e67-6
00:17:57.484 --> 00:17:59.849
the lights are on and the top.

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-0
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.100
Two-story, actually. There's a
little attic space too. There's

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-1
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.969
light up there and there's a
light in the third story, but

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-2
00:18:07.969 --> 00:18:11.641
the doors closed and you can't
see very much in through

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-3
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:15.509
windows, but there's curtains
next door to that. There's a

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-4
00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:19.509
fire hydrant that looks like a
picnic table outside the next

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-5
00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:23.574
house. It has a curved stairway
going up into it and it's two

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-6
00:18:23.574 --> 00:18:27.639
stories and there are people on
the second story, but I don't

ec206bec-27c8-4dca-afa9-3a7238406c2d-7
00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:29.999
see anyone on the first story
that.

3328091d-c629-4ecd-a85e-c96827901c01-0
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.084
house has striped awnings and
then the next house on the block

3328091d-c629-4ecd-a85e-c96827901c01-1
00:18:35.084 --> 00:18:39.850
and that'll finish off. The
block has someone in the second

3328091d-c629-4ecd-a85e-c96827901c01-2
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.696
story and someone walking into
the into the house looks like

3328091d-c629-4ecd-a85e-c96827901c01-3
00:18:44.696 --> 00:18:48.350
maybe carrying a carrying a bag
of something.

3086e2eb-2c59-479e-869d-014d166ae14b-0
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.710
So there's people.

5fed9d67-4814-4442-9201-b1741568d114-0
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.800
Actually, there's people in both
the upper levels.

d8ef434b-ea62-4de0-80c2-9dc24bd8a1ec-0
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.302
As we go back right to, well,
not, not back anywhere, but

d8ef434b-ea62-4de0-80c2-9dc24bd8a1ec-1
00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:07.987
behind that house, so on the
other side of the street, the of

d8ef434b-ea62-4de0-80c2-9dc24bd8a1ec-2
00:19:07.987 --> 00:19:12.823
the block of these three houses,
it looks like there's a little

d8ef434b-ea62-4de0-80c2-9dc24bd8a1ec-3
00:19:12.823 --> 00:19:14.410
fountain and there's.

606e711b-00fd-407e-8471-f22bccbdba3b-0
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.334
A couple of people there at the
fountain. One looks like a child

606e711b-00fd-407e-8471-f22bccbdba3b-1
00:19:20.334 --> 00:19:24.223
and all the streets are
cobblestone. If you go past this

606e711b-00fd-407e-8471-f22bccbdba3b-2
00:19:24.223 --> 00:19:28.589
block to the right, there are a
couple of men standing under an

606e711b-00fd-407e-8471-f22bccbdba3b-3
00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:32.887
awning at the next building and
then another house with people

606e711b-00fd-407e-8471-f22bccbdba3b-4
00:19:32.887 --> 00:19:37.185
in it. So it's not a time that
people are out and about. Looks

606e711b-00fd-407e-8471-f22bccbdba3b-5
00:19:37.185 --> 00:19:39.709
like they're only going into
places.

479e8a2f-6646-4bd8-9baa-c97718f59420-0
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.420
Or or waiting for people, but
it's not a busy street

4ff272f8-ccd8-442c-9c44-b232ea5813b1-0
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.660


148957a6-ad16-40ee-badb-b18d6efdc593-0
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:54.628
Oh well, this is lighter. This
is daytime. So, so looks like

148957a6-ad16-40ee-badb-b18d6efdc593-1
00:19:54.628 --> 00:20:00.079
it's just the night is finished.
People were home and now they're

148957a6-ad16-40ee-badb-b18d6efdc593-2
00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:05.200
coming out for the day. There's
a lot of people in the street

148957a6-ad16-40ee-badb-b18d6efdc593-3
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.487
here. The even though the most
of the picture is done in shades

148957a6-ad16-40ee-badb-b18d6efdc593-4
00:20:10.487 --> 00:20:12.800
of black and white and Gray.

682a9beb-7b07-4c75-89ce-353505c99733-0
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.541
The main house that this man
lives in is quite colorful. It

682a9beb-7b07-4c75-89ce-353505c99733-1
00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:21.900
has blue shutters. It has.

feb920bd-b59e-4545-b2b7-244deab0afb4-0
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.270
Flowers up at the top.

99d4de6c-8354-40d2-8afd-f1d5fa625dc6-0
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.188
On the set by the second story
and the sky is blue with clouds

99d4de6c-8354-40d2-8afd-f1d5fa625dc6-1
00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:33.955
and so it just shows that
there's a lot of activity now

99d4de6c-8354-40d2-8afd-f1d5fa625dc6-2
00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:38.193
and you can see what people are
doing and setting up for their

99d4de6c-8354-40d2-8afd-f1d5fa625dc6-3
00:20:38.193 --> 00:20:42.229
day or their jobs. Looks like
there's someone who might be.

00806053-fd1e-4547-8ca5-8d5af3eb0a43-0
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.132
Like a milkman? It's hard to
tell. It's a couple people in

00806053-fd1e-4547-8ca5-8d5af3eb0a43-1
00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:53.750
cars, someone in a wheelchair
with a cast.

4af4d935-3f12-48ee-b646-c0081cd7fb49-0
00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.837
A mother and child and still
people up in the upper parts of

4af4d935-3f12-48ee-b646-c0081cd7fb49-1
00:21:00.837 --> 00:21:06.036
the houses, but they're more
active. And then over on the

4af4d935-3f12-48ee-b646-c0081cd7fb49-2
00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:11.414
right side there are people
sitting on the stoop, neighbors

4af4d935-3f12-48ee-b646-c0081cd7fb49-3
00:21:11.414 --> 00:21:12.580
visiting and.

81b588b9-8cf1-4112-bdb6-55b02762b549-0
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.200
Yeah, coming in and out of the
houses. {That's it.

46c6aa60-32c4-49e8-bb72-d21de8f73aad-0
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.500
Alright.}

e4cf9aa3-1973-423a-8125-7eed98db579c-0
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.650
Same scene.

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-0
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:35.396
All black and white, except even
more color on this man's house.

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-1
00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:40.024
But we the man is out in the
yard now, and he might be. I

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-2
00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:44.811
can't tell if he's standing or
if he's doing something with

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-3
00:21:44.811 --> 00:21:49.758
flowers, but the house has a
purple roof on the on the bottom

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-4
00:21:49.758 --> 00:21:54.785
that might be just his house is
only one story, and you've got

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-5
00:21:54.785 --> 00:21:59.812
more light. You can see that it
might be an apartment building

d7279e36-7bea-4174-b936-d5afa2b2cfa4-6
00:21:59.812 --> 00:22:00.690
behind him.

254bb54a-90e4-49ad-a1c0-dbe00a6e8406-0
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.708
But his is just a 1 a 2 story
house. There's dormers in the

254bb54a-90e4-49ad-a1c0-dbe00a6e8406-1
00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:11.069
purple roof, so green grass now
is showing. And the flowers that

254bb54a-90e4-49ad-a1c0-dbe00a6e8406-2
00:22:11.069 --> 00:22:15.934
I thought were on the second
story are probably actually a

254bb54a-90e4-49ad-a1c0-dbe00a6e8406-3
00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:20.883
tree that is all orange and
oranges and yellows and whites,

254bb54a-90e4-49ad-a1c0-dbe00a6e8406-4
00:22:20.883 --> 00:22:25.996
so it looks different when you
have more light. The sky is no

254bb54a-90e4-49ad-a1c0-dbe00a6e8406-5
00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:30.779
longer showing as blue, but it's
obviously daytime there.

c9691427-5dbc-47a5-8458-d89d168df668-0
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:35.413
We now have a little girl at the
house next door to the man who

c9691427-5dbc-47a5-8458-d89d168df668-1
00:22:35.413 --> 00:22:39.977
is in full color. She's the only
other thing in full color than

c9691427-5dbc-47a5-8458-d89d168df668-2
00:22:39.977 --> 00:22:44.399
what I've already described.
Other than that people are going

c9691427-5dbc-47a5-8458-d89d168df668-3
00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:45.540
about their day.

b867cc86-524c-4527-9486-f7cb31770842-0
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:53.916
Ooh. It's becoming more
colorful, so more and more color

b867cc86-524c-4527-9486-f7cb31770842-1
00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:59.423
is happening. The blue sky and
the clouds are back. Umm, I'm

b867cc86-524c-4527-9486-f7cb31770842-2
00:22:59.423 --> 00:23:05.021
going to start at the left side.
We've got the little girl is

b867cc86-524c-4527-9486-f7cb31770842-3
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:10.619
there now at the door of the
building. The fire hydrant is in

b867cc86-524c-4527-9486-f7cb31770842-4
00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:16.217
red. The sign on the the the
advertisement on the side of the

b867cc86-524c-4527-9486-f7cb31770842-5
00:23:16.217 --> 00:23:17.030
building.

60885397-a11e-4f56-a13d-2dd5ea52e448-0
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.952
is colorful the people up in the
second and third floor colorful.

60885397-a11e-4f56-a13d-2dd5ea52e448-1
00:23:20.952 --> 00:23:22.120
The roof is colored.

36c36d68-be51-4ea0-a0b5-0b07662cb724-0
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:28.584
And then as we go toward the
man's house, his house looks the

36c36d68-be51-4ea0-a0b5-0b07662cb724-1
00:23:28.584 --> 00:23:34.240
same, but now he has someone
that he's talking to. It looks

36c36d68-be51-4ea0-a0b5-0b07662cb724-2
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.560
like a school.

d5667594-a649-491d-b7dd-e932db90a1ed-0
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:41.351
Schoolgirl and a little boy in
front of him. And then there's

d5667594-a649-491d-b7dd-e932db90a1ed-1
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:43.400
another elderly neighbor.

dc260d23-55ee-4600-9d4b-148666b28a77-0
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.315
Or older neighbor at his drive
as well, with a younger person

dc260d23-55ee-4600-9d4b-148666b28a77-1
00:23:49.315 --> 00:23:54.530
next to him and there's a looks
like a little girl out in the

dc260d23-55ee-4600-9d4b-148666b28a77-2
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.970
street in front of his house.

652e907e-53ed-4533-b846-3fdf62f10988-0
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.749
Um, the apartment building
behind him has a little color

652e907e-53ed-4533-b846-3fdf62f10988-1
00:24:02.749 --> 00:24:08.450
now, but basically it's the same
action and there's color coming

652e907e-53ed-4533-b846-3fdf62f10988-2
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.520
to the houses to the right of
him.

a8f912a6-46d8-4787-a923-3f060959c17e-0
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.334
Little bits of color where the
bricks are beginning to look red

a8f912a6-46d8-4787-a923-3f060959c17e-1
00:24:17.334 --> 00:24:21.030
and the awnings are beginning to
look blue and white, and then

a8f912a6-46d8-4787-a923-3f060959c17e-2
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.910
the next house.

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-0
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.518
It's quite colorful. And there's
an artist on the 2nd floor. He

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-1
00:24:28.518 --> 00:24:33.026
was in the other picture too. In
front of those two houses is a

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-2
00:24:33.026 --> 00:24:37.464
move moving van. Yeah, movers,
yes, a moving van. And they are

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-3
00:24:37.464 --> 00:24:41.832
actually moving the people out
of the house in the middle and

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-4
00:24:41.832 --> 00:24:46.199
they're bringing things up into
the moving van. There's still

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-5
00:24:46.199 --> 00:24:50.707
someone over at the fountain. It
looks like a young person. And

f4993483-3469-43a4-b497-c182065c2f6a-6
00:24:50.707 --> 00:24:51.059
then.

75a520bb-8cf4-4edf-9aea-2cce3f23df21-0
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.929
To the right, there is a lady in
in the street looking on and a

75a520bb-8cf4-4edf-9aea-2cce3f23df21-1
00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:02.208
couple of people in the
background. One is walking and

75a520bb-8cf4-4edf-9aea-2cce3f23df21-2
00:25:02.208 --> 00:25:06.253
there's a little more color
coming into those other

75a520bb-8cf4-4edf-9aea-2cce3f23df21-3
00:25:06.253 --> 00:25:11.233
buildings. It's interesting the
way that they've made this part

75a520bb-8cf4-4edf-9aea-2cce3f23df21-4
00:25:11.233 --> 00:25:11.700
color.

8021b1ee-6a2e-4504-b7a2-d7e39d6db7ac-0
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.991
Here's the next one. I'm going
to say everything's colorful.

8021b1ee-6a2e-4504-b7a2-d7e39d6db7ac-1
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:22.309
Yes, at first glance, even the
streets are not just Gray

8021b1ee-6a2e-4504-b7a2-d7e39d6db7ac-2
00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:27.082
cobblestones. They have bits of
color in them and that is, you

8021b1ee-6a2e-4504-b7a2-d7e39d6db7ac-3
00:25:27.082 --> 00:25:31.780
know, the day is in full swing
and you can you can tell that.

8021b1ee-6a2e-4504-b7a2-d7e39d6db7ac-4
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.250
And so it's like the dawning of
the day brings more color.

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-0
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.041
So there's lots of people in the
streets now doing various

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-1
00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:45.263
things. The milkman is there. We
can see that he's a milkman now

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-2
00:25:45.263 --> 00:25:49.160
because there's a milk truck
behind him underneath the tree

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-3
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.926
by the man's house. There's
people everywhere, even up on

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-4
00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:56.823
the roof of the house where
people were moving from. And it

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-5
00:25:56.823 --> 00:26:00.655
must be an apartment, because
some of the people that were

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-6
00:26:00.655 --> 00:26:04.682
there before are still there.
The moving van is gone. There's

d86febab-c120-4402-b105-b5eae128959a-7
00:26:04.682 --> 00:26:07.280
now a red car over by the
fountain and.

4abff409-97fd-4743-8228-a59ca0cf9db9-0
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.220
The artist.

c53573ff-99cc-4b02-a070-c94a97c16880-0
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.950
Has art out on the street now on
easels

4e7eaf99-5e2c-4ff1-9d0c-69b92bc5cd8b-0
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.379
And he's still painting up in
his upstairs, but there's

4e7eaf99-5e2c-4ff1-9d0c-69b92bc5cd8b-1
00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:27.300
someone down there looks like
he'd be selling the artwork.

0948d749-9014-45fd-b0f1-f514529d6763-0
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.131
That's about it. That's
different. It's just that

0948d749-9014-45fd-b0f1-f514529d6763-1
00:26:33.131 --> 00:26:36.682
everything is so much more
colorful. It actually makes it

0948d749-9014-45fd-b0f1-f514529d6763-2
00:26:36.682 --> 00:26:37.540
look cheerful.

6ed5f88f-65f3-406d-b047-9a3859d8d3e3-0
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.410


16ab6580-52b7-40d6-9078-7de146ad3d59-0
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.440
Well.

93cd1746-a310-4a45-a34a-0300c9da4ba4-0
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.390
It's getting darker.

9ea15f60-bc46-41fe-a786-e5a1d3966cae-0
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.180
So.

bc2f5050-57b0-4ddd-a816-18a52f78a428-0
00:26:53.490 --> 00:27:00.140
The colours are more intense,
but the sky has some purple in

bc2f5050-57b0-4ddd-a816-18a52f78a428-1
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.340
it now and.

d290ca62-4a45-4e14-b096-956b2dcabb5b-0
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.070
People are.

8539419f-1d7e-46b9-bc18-9933a69aabb1-0
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.535
They're they're more settled
into what they're doing. There's

8539419f-1d7e-46b9-bc18-9933a69aabb1-1
00:27:11.535 --> 00:27:16.126
a couple over on the left that
looks like they might be on a

8539419f-1d7e-46b9-bc18-9933a69aabb1-2
00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:17.179
date. There's.

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-0
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.149
There's a man. It might be our
man. I can't tell for sure. I

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-1
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:27.399
don't remember him having a
mustache, walking like he's

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-2
00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:32.257
heading home. The milk truck is
still there, so maybe they live

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-3
00:27:32.257 --> 00:27:36.886
near there. There is on the
House on the very left way up at

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-4
00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:41.744
the top there's an old man and
two children, and the old man is

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-5
00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:46.449
pointing toward the sky and the
boy has a telescope. And so I

a2236832-18bc-4038-a009-a6f2cb0b5679-6
00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:49.030
would assume from from that
that.

32e67eb8-b3ea-41ad-9fae-f2558653d8b8-0
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.507
They're looking at something in
the night sky, maybe the early

32e67eb8-b3ea-41ad-9fae-f2558653d8b8-1
00:27:52.507 --> 00:27:52.940
planets.

3d95f4d2-eeae-4f96-bcf2-f37fd3ee03b7-0
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.260
Um.

dc736bf6-75f9-4ff9-b845-cd482c6fb75e-0
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:02.617
I think everything else just
looks like it's a bit settling.

dc736bf6-75f9-4ff9-b845-cd482c6fb75e-1
00:28:02.617 --> 00:28:04.460
There are a lot of.

1f35b12c-d6f5-4fcc-8790-11176f7e4032-0
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.924
Children in the streets? There's
a little cart. Looks like

1f35b12c-d6f5-4fcc-8790-11176f7e4032-1
00:28:08.924 --> 00:28:09.880
they're selling.

d3f7c911-38d3-4659-880f-260fe05320b5-0
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.980
Flowers and.

6d6d1096-5de4-4584-85c3-f0936440741f-0
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.990
Other than that.

7e1fbf8d-1fa2-4d4b-9aad-ae2227896905-0
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.570
Um, just a lot of people there.

07ef5671-9ee0-407d-b076-be4412786d98-0
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.602
They're interacting, but it
doesn't look like it did before,

07ef5671-9ee0-407d-b076-be4412786d98-1
00:28:25.602 --> 00:28:29.251
like they were heading out to
work. It looks like they're just

07ef5671-9ee0-407d-b076-be4412786d98-2
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:31.800
settled or doing something for
the evening.

3a246d85-f058-45db-ba0e-d47be41ee9b8-0
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.870
OK.

aea8e69c-616a-4c19-ad65-0a80a3d6acd7-0
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.200
Well, and here we are at night
time again.

ba31e1a7-4eab-436a-8073-15ddc50789ec-0
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.320
The sky is very much of a
sunset.

ddee9228-6b04-4cb3-afd3-6dce277fb759-0
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:48.437
Things are fading into shadows
and there are just fewer people

ddee9228-6b04-4cb3-afd3-6dce277fb759-1
00:28:48.437 --> 00:28:53.745
on the street. We're no longer
by the man's house. We are back

ddee9228-6b04-4cb3-afd3-6dce277fb759-2
00:28:53.745 --> 00:28:59.053
to the scene where there's an
intersection and a fountain with

ddee9228-6b04-4cb3-afd3-6dce277fb759-3
00:28:59.053 --> 00:29:03.856
a statue in it and the house
that he passed before. He's

ddee9228-6b04-4cb3-afd3-6dce277fb759-4
00:29:03.856 --> 00:29:08.911
walking under that same street
light in the other direction

ddee9228-6b04-4cb3-afd3-6dce277fb759-5
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:11.860
from what he was doing before
and.

8c76a1c7-a745-415c-8ebe-fddda636cb3f-0
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.270
But the houses are still
colorful.

c6a6b07f-65e1-4dc8-a8ae-de460554c5ee-0
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.300
And the cafe is open.

8293158e-96b0-46e4-8070-f00009c87a08-0
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:26.215
That you just see that, um, it's
quieting down and getting

8293158e-96b0-46e4-8070-f00009c87a08-1
00:29:26.215 --> 00:29:26.750
darker.

8dfb5d95-6f30-418d-b70e-db3cdafd0665-0
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:35.580
So

1830a34f-3244-43ed-8bb3-ecc49930f692-0
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.930
Sky is purple.

36914d2f-dfd0-40ad-bfa3-0a7378aab34d-0
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.680
All the buildings are black and
white.

78493a6b-f751-47b1-9c3f-741445ed1333-0
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.860
And the only colorful item other
than the sky is the man.

46683c55-2b34-40a6-a35a-baf3b35f2302-0
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.003
Who he does have a mustache is
the man who's been walking

46683c55-2b34-40a6-a35a-baf3b35f2302-1
00:29:55.003 --> 00:29:55.530
around.

aed7ad67-7622-4601-8940-b5f0470a235c-0
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.990
And um.

f79fb27f-1ea3-4d94-9472-3dacb5fc2f81-0
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:04.017
The person, well, he's walking
up toward the house, and the

f79fb27f-1ea3-4d94-9472-3dacb5fc2f81-1
00:30:04.017 --> 00:30:09.700
person looking out the window at
him looks a bit surprised to see

f79fb27f-1ea3-4d94-9472-3dacb5fc2f81-2
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:15.040
him and the other. So, so does
someone from the second story.

d16a7d54-4d4b-4e6c-8024-b5e180d3256b-0
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:22.332
And it appears that everyone is
looking at him from what I can

d16a7d54-4d4b-4e6c-8024-b5e180d3256b-1
00:30:22.332 --> 00:30:25.690
see, which is something brand
new.

e1115818-5f1d-4aa1-b4c1-0e5ac5626a16-0
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.574
There might be one person who's
not looking at him, but in all

e1115818-5f1d-4aa1-b4c1-0e5ac5626a16-1
00:30:31.574 --> 00:30:34.890
the houses up and down the
street, they're watching him.

49c7191e-0387-49dc-85fa-604c6c34a382-0
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:50.052
It did look like he had
something in his hand or

49c7191e-0387-49dc-85fa-604c6c34a382-1
00:30:50.052 --> 00:30:54.513
something. Yeah, something in
his hand, but I couldn't tell

49c7191e-0387-49dc-85fa-604c6c34a382-2
00:30:54.513 --> 00:30:59.122
what it was. And now we see him
walking away from that house.

49c7191e-0387-49dc-85fa-604c6c34a382-3
00:30:59.122 --> 00:31:03.657
It's a close up, so we don't see
very much. We see that it's

49c7191e-0387-49dc-85fa-604c6c34a382-4
00:31:03.657 --> 00:31:06.780
still black and white except for
the man.

5e82791e-cbe8-4c00-9912-1e4a8d5b5bd4-0
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.711
The little bit of sky that we
see, the girl that he apparently

5e82791e-cbe8-4c00-9912-1e4a8d5b5bd4-1
00:31:11.711 --> 00:31:16.160
gave something to and she's very
excited and it's a flower.

be4e37ed-fbcd-4e26-8eba-768162492ec2-0
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:23.092
And then looking out of the
house is the man is the man that

be4e37ed-fbcd-4e26-8eba-768162492ec2-1
00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:29.532
was in the house before, but now
his bow tie is red and he has a

be4e37ed-fbcd-4e26-8eba-768162492ec2-2
00:31:29.532 --> 00:31:35.773
red flower in his hand. So this
man that is the main character

be4e37ed-fbcd-4e26-8eba-768162492ec2-3
00:31:35.773 --> 00:31:37.160
in this story.

0ffa0aa9-9ce6-48d5-957f-90a9b5de30c9-0
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.447
#END_flowerman Has made this
little girl very happy. {Yeah.

0ffa0aa9-9ce6-48d5-957f-90a9b5de30c9-1
00:31:43.447 --> 00:31:45.690
OK, so that was the story,
yeah.}

1a1befb0-64fc-4daf-acbb-2e7c5ed8e1f8-0
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.340
{That was about 20 minutes. So
yeah, yeah.}

c499efc0-0b92-434b-906e-ecd7e8d2b403-0
00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.420
{Alright, Yep.

c1c1f9bd-82f7-4958-948c-833c653d5127-0
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.520
Let's do another complex scene.

7898f7e9-14cd-4ff2-b82f-64a6faaaa0c3-0
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.289
This is not a complex scene.
This is part of the book graphic

7898f7e9-14cd-4ff2-b82f-64a6faaaa0c3-1
00:32:10.289 --> 00:32:11.610
novel. It is, yes.}

0191830c-d3ee-42bd-a7ef-f15ce72c2fe0-0
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:21.138
{OK, how many do we have here?
Do you know this is about 6

0191830c-d3ee-42bd-a7ef-f15ce72c2fe0-1
00:32:21.138 --> 00:32:23.920
pages or six? OK, yeah.}

b2c82ea1-9f40-4c55-bb10-2f771f673d52-0
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:35.568
#START_arrival-6 OK, we have a
sepia tone story here that has a

b2c82ea1-9f40-4c55-bb10-2f771f673d52-1
00:32:35.568 --> 00:32:39.450
lot of pictures on a double page
spread.

a652f6a3-94a4-4dc3-afa5-822c63a8be22-0
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.980
So.

974045f5-43f8-4cc8-99a3-225ef341240b-0
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.870
At the top we see a pot and then
there is a little.

672af0bb-af8e-4b1c-bac3-4ee979193e06-0
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.091
Insect type. I'll call it an
insect flying onto that pot. It

672af0bb-af8e-4b1c-bac3-4ee979193e06-1
00:32:55.091 --> 00:33:00.387
could be a bird, it could be a I
don't know what. It could be

672af0bb-af8e-4b1c-bac3-4ee979193e06-2
00:33:00.387 --> 00:33:05.342
like a praying mantis or
something. And it it has a stick

672af0bb-af8e-4b1c-bac3-4ee979193e06-3
00:33:05.342 --> 00:33:09.870
in its beak and it's putting the
stick into the pot.

181d262f-b692-48cf-98ed-a5d4e87ad634-0
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.890
Umm.

296d73ae-9566-4ba5-bce3-9e6b677feee3-0
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.750
So the next thing is that we're.

a2eb0109-60f8-4f46-bcf0-522688a2103f-0
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:23.769
Looking at. Oh, let me say that
the pot is on a table by a

a2eb0109-60f8-4f46-bcf0-522688a2103f-1
00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:27.720
window. OK, so next thing we see
is.

4a84d457-daff-4eb2-97d3-e089b323823e-0
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:35.266
A man with a with pen and ink
getting ready to write on a

4a84d457-daff-4eb2-97d3-e089b323823e-1
00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:41.309
piece of paper. It's night time,
whereas the other one appeared

4a84d457-daff-4eb2-97d3-e089b323823e-2
00:33:41.309 --> 00:33:47.069
to be daytime because there was
light in this window and now

4a84d457-daff-4eb2-97d3-e089b323823e-3
00:33:47.069 --> 00:33:48.580
there's a light.

7c931832-9177-40b8-9f12-e26293d61166-0
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:55.272
Well, maybe the light wasn't in
the window. Maybe that was just

7c931832-9177-40b8-9f12-e26293d61166-1
00:33:55.272 --> 00:34:00.164
a close up and it's the light
from his lamp. Yeah, maybe so.

7c931832-9177-40b8-9f12-e26293d61166-2
00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:02.570
OK, so this man is sitting in.

cf101b77-1e91-4e02-90dd-ecea89da704a-0
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:09.541
A-frame. Like he's at a window
and the pot is in front of him

cf101b77-1e91-4e02-90dd-ecea89da704a-1
00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:14.837
outside that frame. And he
begins to write and we see him

cf101b77-1e91-4e02-90dd-ecea89da704a-2
00:34:14.837 --> 00:34:19.860
writing. There's some money on
the table, and then he.

066b19b0-616a-4f8b-a7ff-bc3fbc85588f-0
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.726
The next scene he is folding up
the paper that he's written on

066b19b0-616a-4f8b-a7ff-bc3fbc85588f-1
00:34:25.726 --> 00:34:30.602
and he's making origami out of
it like a bird. So he gets that

066b19b0-616a-4f8b-a7ff-bc3fbc85588f-2
00:34:30.602 --> 00:34:34.550
made. You still see the the
money and the ink pot.

5bebb15f-5d8e-4420-9acf-3f116b35371e-0
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.555
And now he's putting this
origami bird into an envelope,

5bebb15f-5d8e-4420-9acf-3f116b35371e-1
00:34:40.555 --> 00:34:45.549
putting the money in the
envelope as well, licking the

5bebb15f-5d8e-4420-9acf-3f116b35371e-2
00:34:45.549 --> 00:34:51.360
envelope and putting a stamp on
it. Then you see him at the top

5bebb15f-5d8e-4420-9acf-3f116b35371e-3
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.172
of the next page, going to going
down the stairs. He's dressed,

5bebb15f-5d8e-4420-9acf-3f116b35371e-4
00:34:57.172 --> 00:35:02.983
he put his jacket on and he has
this, his pet next to him. It's

5bebb15f-5d8e-4420-9acf-3f116b35371e-5
00:35:02.983 --> 00:35:04.890
this odd looking pet.

4f42f166-a6a4-495c-b6bd-35b28fb74454-0
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.429
Before. Alright, so this little
pet is walking with him and he

4f42f166-a6a4-495c-b6bd-35b28fb74454-1
00:35:11.429 --> 00:35:16.598
stops and talks to probably a
neighbor who's carrying a basket

4f42f166-a6a4-495c-b6bd-35b28fb74454-2
00:35:16.598 --> 00:35:19.060
with probably a cat in it and.

e09e2c0c-2a60-45ab-b2f9-31c8b8ff6190-0
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.623
Um, it she's pointing to
something for him, so he

e09e2c0c-2a60-45ab-b2f9-31c8b8ff6190-1
00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:27.010
probably has asked where.

8a9612ec-bccd-4fdd-b50f-c061a9644761-0
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.355
Where the mailbox is and so she
goes to this mailbox which is

8a9612ec-bccd-4fdd-b50f-c061a9644761-1
00:35:36.355 --> 00:35:42.098
not like I've seen before and he
goes to his mailbox and he reads

8a9612ec-bccd-4fdd-b50f-c061a9644761-2
00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:47.494
the directions or the time but
it looks like directions as to

8a9612ec-bccd-4fdd-b50f-c061a9644761-3
00:35:47.494 --> 00:35:52.715
what to do and he puts the
letter in the slot with his left

8a9612ec-bccd-4fdd-b50f-c061a9644761-4
00:35:52.715 --> 00:35:57.849
hand, but his right hand has
this lever so he is had to do

8a9612ec-bccd-4fdd-b50f-c061a9644761-5
00:35:57.849 --> 00:35:58.720
something.

f6409ef0-e0bd-4a0b-a295-7d801e63fca0-0
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.525
Make the slot open and so he
finishes with that. He looks up

f6409ef0-e0bd-4a0b-a295-7d801e63fca0-1
00:36:04.525 --> 00:36:10.532
and we see that what he's looked
at is the mailbox has a like a

f6409ef0-e0bd-4a0b-a295-7d801e63fca0-2
00:36:10.532 --> 00:36:16.446
hot air balloon on top of it and
it's floating up into the air

f6409ef0-e0bd-4a0b-a295-7d801e63fca0-3
00:36:16.446 --> 00:36:21.890
and you now see the bigger
scene. The man is walking with

f6409ef0-e0bd-4a0b-a295-7d801e63fca0-4
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:27.334
his pet through looks like
countryside, but the trees are

f6409ef0-e0bd-4a0b-a295-7d801e63fca0-5
00:36:27.334 --> 00:36:28.929
only shaped like.

1e31f955-2a99-4f7b-a0a3-f127399e4dce-0
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.180
A single standing up leaf, and
there's a bunch of them.

670eaac1-5c6d-4cb1-ba1b-edaca90eeaee-0
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.400
Now we have a close up of one of
those trees that looks like a

670eaac1-5c6d-4cb1-ba1b-edaca90eeaee-1
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.190
leaf, and it's splitting in 2
keeps splitting further.

ec8245aa-d2e0-494e-ae2d-6456c6d2e0f2-0
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.286
{Now this looks like I'm
supposed to go all the way

ec8245aa-d2e0-494e-ae2d-6456c6d2e0f2-1
00:36:51.286 --> 00:36:55.159
across, doesn't it? It does, and
you don't have to. Yeah, I

ec8245aa-d2e0-494e-ae2d-6456c6d2e0f2-2
00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:57.870
didn't see that before, so I
don't know.}

6c504531-e89a-4f91-9ddd-3fdd0de0a199-0
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:05.309
{Just an exception, yeah. OK, }
so we the whole top shows this

6c504531-e89a-4f91-9ddd-3fdd0de0a199-1
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:11.060
leaf opening or splitting in
two, separating and a little.

fb04c97c-ad40-4ab8-a7c6-a70d06d99337-0
00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.350
Strand of.

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-0
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:20.083
Well, it's probably some sort of
bud coming up. It just looks

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-1
00:37:20.083 --> 00:37:24.856
like a little thread at first
and then it gets taller and you

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-2
00:37:24.856 --> 00:37:29.783
see a little dot at the top and
then you see the next one where

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-3
00:37:29.783 --> 00:37:34.325
it has a little bud and the
leaves are are disintegrating.

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-4
00:37:34.325 --> 00:37:39.175
When you get to the next line,
you see the leaves disintegrate

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-5
00:37:39.175 --> 00:37:44.025
and die and the flower becomes
more and more and more obvious.

9f8b07ab-a7ca-4121-8343-c57aafd1d3b1-6
00:37:44.025 --> 00:37:45.179
You see petals.

9a8480ae-035a-4a25-9dec-6a36665b42a8-0
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.480
On it and then you see looks
like.

c2cb5e60-1753-47d5-8da9-b4a96a48a88e-0
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.770
Petals

4145e542-2531-4324-a28b-17e6626b6ebd-0
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:57.776
Flying off of it like they're
just blowing in the wind and and

4145e542-2531-4324-a28b-17e6626b6ebd-1
00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:03.622
it just keeps on going and then
the the flower looks different

4145e542-2531-4324-a28b-17e6626b6ebd-2
00:38:03.622 --> 00:38:07.520
because it's lost all these
little white.

a1691bc2-08c3-4ab0-ad99-8ef265b028c3-0
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.968
Parts that have flown away and
now it's dark with rounded

a1691bc2-08c3-4ab0-ad99-8ef265b028c3-1
00:38:12.968 --> 00:38:17.090
edges. It just keeps
transforming, so we're seeing

a1691bc2-08c3-4ab0-ad99-8ef265b028c3-2
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:17.980
this whole.

32f12dd3-8029-40e7-9a02-1683bfb03801-0
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:26.023
Path of what the flower does as
it grows and probably dies. And

32f12dd3-8029-40e7-9a02-1683bfb03801-1
00:38:26.023 --> 00:38:32.035
so it's now it's all brown. And
then there's other animal

32f12dd3-8029-40e7-9a02-1683bfb03801-2
00:38:32.035 --> 00:38:38.875
animals, insects that are flying
around it and it looks like they

32f12dd3-8029-40e7-9a02-1683bfb03801-3
00:38:38.875 --> 00:38:45.302
might be coming to that flower
and laying eggs. That's how it

32f12dd3-8029-40e7-9a02-1683bfb03801-4
00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:50.069
looks to me. And so there's
these little egg.

3784328f-6987-4a6d-b38f-3c833663263f-0
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.675
Looking things on this flower
area now and the next one shows

3784328f-6987-4a6d-b38f-3c833663263f-1
00:38:55.675 --> 00:39:01.478
that the egg looking things are
falling on the ground and either

3784328f-6987-4a6d-b38f-3c833663263f-2
00:39:01.478 --> 00:39:07.014
other insects are eating them.
So maybe it's a fruit, I don't

3784328f-6987-4a6d-b38f-3c833663263f-3
00:39:07.014 --> 00:39:12.728
know. Or or maybe those things
are coming out of the the little

3784328f-6987-4a6d-b38f-3c833663263f-4
00:39:12.728 --> 00:39:17.995
eggs. I don't know, it's hard to
tell, but it ends up that

3784328f-6987-4a6d-b38f-3c833663263f-5
00:39:17.995 --> 00:39:19.960
there's no more white.

72a49f24-0ec2-4681-b5f9-c1783751ad5c-0
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:26.254
Things on the flower, the
flowers, black, it gets darker,

72a49f24-0ec2-4681-b5f9-c1783751ad5c-1
00:39:26.254 --> 00:39:33.200
it begins to change and lose its
blackness. And it it's left with

72a49f24-0ec2-4681-b5f9-c1783751ad5c-2
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.990
like a web of of.

7e37e866-f4bb-4863-ac4b-e21169c4923f-0
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:36.480
Um.

d8170274-34ab-4045-b772-8eb0a747eaac-0
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.492
Wow, that's hard to describe.
Like a web where the black just

d8170274-34ab-4045-b772-8eb0a747eaac-1
00:39:43.492 --> 00:39:48.480
keeps disintegrating and it
turns into like a transparent

d8170274-34ab-4045-b772-8eb0a747eaac-2
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.984
skeleton of the flower and very
much at the end like a shape of

d8170274-34ab-4045-b772-8eb0a747eaac-3
00:39:53.984 --> 00:39:57.510
what we say in Florida as a sand
dollar.

b61f717b-667f-4e97-87b0-d54f39de1d7e-0
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:04.913
Yeah, but I see snow and the
snow is coming and it's covering

b61f717b-667f-4e97-87b0-d54f39de1d7e-1
00:40:04.913 --> 00:40:10.751
up the flower, which again
looked like a tree to begin with

b61f717b-667f-4e97-87b0-d54f39de1d7e-2
00:40:10.751 --> 00:40:16.589
and and it is covering it up. So
it's the whole stem or or.

7fd2354a-2291-4633-a6b8-184eaa786364-0
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.030
Trunk of it is now covered with
snow.

bb7dc737-e2c5-4e48-a67b-3f0ae20b0fa9-0
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.014
Well, this is interesting. I
don't have any idea how this

bb7dc737-e2c5-4e48-a67b-3f0ae20b0fa9-1
00:40:30.014 --> 00:40:30.450
fits in.

2ed84cd5-72c1-4be2-953c-1dacb77e3cd7-0
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:36.010
Except that there's snow. {Yes.
Good. Yes.}

2fb260ec-68d4-4abc-9bc4-641af326d01a-0
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.550
OK, so here we are in a city.

65945ebb-2d59-4f55-bd26-0cb7ca334738-0
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:43.250
Um.

e0fa76a1-1e96-474d-9420-efc06c616d67-0
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:51.697
I would say there's snow all
over the city and I don't see a

e0fa76a1-1e96-474d-9420-efc06c616d67-1
00:40:51.697 --> 00:40:56.070
lot of activity, but I see big
buildings and.

7ca974cf-7e08-4da2-aaaf-c6977166b52a-0
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:02.597
If you read the story that we
were on the other day, you might

7ca974cf-7e08-4da2-aaaf-c6977166b52a-1
00:41:02.597 --> 00:41:07.804
recognize some of these
buildings, yes, because they're

7ca974cf-7e08-4da2-aaaf-c6977166b52a-2
00:41:07.804 --> 00:41:12.824
the same kind and little
waterways that aren't really

7ca974cf-7e08-4da2-aaaf-c6977166b52a-3
00:41:12.824 --> 00:41:18.496
functioning as waterways. So
we're in this city and it's all

7ca974cf-7e08-4da2-aaaf-c6977166b52a-4
00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:23.516
of these unique shaped
buildings, round ones and pots

7ca974cf-7e08-4da2-aaaf-c6977166b52a-5
00:41:23.516 --> 00:41:27.050
on the tops of buildings and
windows.

bf0e462e-3edd-4ab7-a10d-ec3addc136ae-0
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.573
All over the one big building
and a smokestacks and a couple

bf0e462e-3edd-4ab7-a10d-ec3addc136ae-1
00:41:31.573 --> 00:41:33.180
well in a lot of them.

8188ec41-20c7-4505-9741-8677236b91dd-0
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.290
And one building that's tall
like a rounded tipi

2dc02bf2-77e2-458f-a1e3-0da447e59a25-0
00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.010
Umm.

9514471b-888b-457f-a85f-46ca3680d6bb-0
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.920
{Let's it. Let's see where we're
going, all right?}

8607a06a-9a6c-419e-a3d2-203e80352817-0
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:53.720
Well, maybe this man lives in
one of those buildings, yes.

99ae0980-856a-4b2e-bef5-ad301798a1db-0
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.540
Because right now, we're back to
see this man.

af6ea533-6a4e-479c-a8a0-202d4fd2ac45-0
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.360
And so now we're seeing that
this pot.

5b01527c-fbc4-4807-ba0b-62dd08c84140-0
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:11.802
That we saw first of all is
really outside his window and

5b01527c-fbc4-4807-ba0b-62dd08c84140-1
00:42:11.802 --> 00:42:18.369
the frame we saw before was a
window. And so we're looking at

5b01527c-fbc4-4807-ba0b-62dd08c84140-2
00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.169
the pot and this.

815121f8-76bc-4c67-b9b6-0886107998ce-0
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:27.296
What I had thought was an insect
or a bird before is obviously a

815121f8-76bc-4c67-b9b6-0886107998ce-1
00:42:27.296 --> 00:42:30.720
bird, and when it had brought
the the.

71dc8339-c1b8-44b1-857a-246ca9003dc1-0
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.976
Piece of straw or whatever to
the pot. It was building a nest

71dc8339-c1b8-44b1-857a-246ca9003dc1-1
00:42:37.976 --> 00:42:43.089
and now there's little birds
peeping out of the nest and the

71dc8339-c1b8-44b1-857a-246ca9003dc1-2
00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:48.118
big bird came to feed them.
There's three of them in there,

71dc8339-c1b8-44b1-857a-246ca9003dc1-3
00:42:48.118 --> 00:42:48.370
so.

e8db5b0f-2bf5-4ef8-a3ff-6f03d51317f7-0
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.249
Then we see this man looking at
a picture of a family. He's

e8db5b0f-2bf5-4ef8-a3ff-6f03d51317f7-1
00:42:55.249 --> 00:43:00.384
sitting on his bed inside the
room. We're looking from inside

e8db5b0f-2bf5-4ef8-a3ff-6f03d51317f7-2
00:43:00.384 --> 00:43:05.519
the room out. We see the pot
outside. We see laundry hanging.

e8db5b0f-2bf5-4ef8-a3ff-6f03d51317f7-3
00:43:05.519 --> 00:43:10.986
We see that he's in his house or
his room. There are letters on a

e8db5b0f-2bf5-4ef8-a3ff-6f03d51317f7-4
00:43:10.986 --> 00:43:16.369
bulletin board on the left, and
his desk is in front of him. His

e8db5b0f-2bf5-4ef8-a3ff-6f03d51317f7-5
00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:19.020
shoes are on the floor and he's.

ec3d24ec-2a73-45e0-87d2-b10e5b752d3a-0
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.504
Just sitting there on his bed
looking at this picture of the

ec3d24ec-2a73-45e0-87d2-b10e5b752d3a-1
00:43:22.504 --> 00:43:26.131
family. His desk is in front of
him with that that gas lamp that

ec3d24ec-2a73-45e0-87d2-b10e5b752d3a-2
00:43:26.131 --> 00:43:26.689
was there.

ac43d46b-1b0d-4ef7-ba4c-60e42b7e0cb1-0
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.580
On the next page we see his pet.

6021dee0-d7ed-49ad-a685-55f53068d3d2-0
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.320
Ohh, the pet is sleeping next to
him on the bed.

3a346d73-45f7-460f-b350-c8a6f77fa597-0
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:42.214
That we focus on the pet and the
pet gets up and the pet jumps

3a346d73-45f7-460f-b350-c8a6f77fa597-1
00:43:42.214 --> 00:43:47.552
off and the man wonders where
it's going. And so the pet, the

3a346d73-45f7-460f-b350-c8a6f77fa597-2
00:43:47.552 --> 00:43:53.149
man still has the picture in his
hand, but he's watching the pet

3a346d73-45f7-460f-b350-c8a6f77fa597-3
00:43:53.149 --> 00:43:58.228
and the pet goes down a like a
trap door that has a ladder

3a346d73-45f7-460f-b350-c8a6f77fa597-4
00:43:58.228 --> 00:43:59.090
coming up.

d05beb31-e4d1-401c-97e1-ce4cc08c7c2f-0
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.833
And the man, the next thing we
see is that the man goes down

d05beb31-e4d1-401c-97e1-ce4cc08c7c2f-1
00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:10.000
that ladder and the pet is has
heard something and he's heard

d05beb31-e4d1-401c-97e1-ce4cc08c7c2f-2
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.333
that mail was delivered. And so
he's standing there next to the

d05beb31-e4d1-401c-97e1-ce4cc08c7c2f-3
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:20.750
piece of mail. The man picks up
the piece of mail, opens it, and

d05beb31-e4d1-401c-97e1-ce4cc08c7c2f-4
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:26.166
he sees the origami bird and he
opens up the letter and is happy

d05beb31-e4d1-401c-97e1-ce4cc08c7c2f-5
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:28.500
and he looks out his window.

f0dc90b2-32fb-47e8-8c07-63372de86cd0-0
00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.370
These must just be snapshots of
what we saw.

a07738ff-de02-4a0c-ad0a-3f6f71a952da-0
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.720
we have an origami bird.

51adfbdf-d8f9-4c1a-acd3-8b7ee0a905da-0
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:47.610
We have.

6d4c1d3d-3696-4c37-bdda-9f4353a07e4a-0
00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:55.593
Um, I I would have said that was
a fire pit. Maybe it's some sort

6d4c1d3d-3696-4c37-bdda-9f4353a07e4a-1
00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:59.440
of little stove. We see the
man's hat and.

b12cc6f8-abd0-4674-9852-7ea8fbb4b4e0-0
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:06.706
I can't tell if it's a shirt or
a towel. Next to him we see his

b12cc6f8-abd0-4674-9852-7ea8fbb4b4e0-1
00:45:06.706 --> 00:45:12.493
strange looking food and fork.
We see other drawings of strange

b12cc6f8-abd0-4674-9852-7ea8fbb4b4e0-2
00:45:12.493 --> 00:45:18.099
flying machines that we've seen
in the previous story, and we

b12cc6f8-abd0-4674-9852-7ea8fbb4b4e0-3
00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:23.795
see something that I don't know
what it is, but it's some sort

b12cc6f8-abd0-4674-9852-7ea8fbb4b4e0-4
00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:24.790
of utensil.

f0c60ada-5889-4aba-9e46-77213cd564fc-0
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.030
Um, we see his.

a51e7e7e-7b0d-4b8a-9a59-f5545d82daf0-0
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:36.623
A hot drink on a newspaper. The
picture of the family and the

a51e7e7e-7b0d-4b8a-9a59-f5545d82daf0-1
00:45:36.623 --> 00:45:37.990
man paying.

fb9e8bcf-4026-4a1c-8468-497a788b9a2a-0
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.900
Someone with a coin. It looks
like a younger person.

513851d4-4bb2-46e0-a428-c94435620dfe-0
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:59.178
Sure is a lot to digest. Yes. So
the first thing we see on the

513851d4-4bb2-46e0-a428-c94435620dfe-1
00:45:59.178 --> 00:46:05.060
left is a happy family at
dinner. The pet is still there.

d1bcc378-a9da-4cb5-a3b5-b04051e711b6-0
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.630
Umm.

3f7244ce-4f46-4601-b30c-b220d006a32f-0
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.190
We see now that that last
picture.

40b4f220-e013-497b-aaff-d376937fcf84-0
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.582
Was a close up of this picture
where the man is putting. Must

40b4f220-e013-497b-aaff-d376937fcf84-1
00:46:20.582 --> 00:46:25.947
be a coin because I saw that
before in this girl's hand. So

40b4f220-e013-497b-aaff-d376937fcf84-2
00:46:25.947 --> 00:46:31.490
it is a younger person and you
see the coffee cup behind him.

71ff23c7-3b78-4da8-b007-12794a4f4d36-0
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:37.388
And we're beginning to see some
of the other things that looked

71ff23c7-3b78-4da8-b007-12794a4f4d36-1
00:46:37.388 --> 00:46:41.288
like they were a part of
something else, but it was

71ff23c7-3b78-4da8-b007-12794a4f4d36-2
00:46:41.288 --> 00:46:46.087
basically an introduction to the
next part of the story. And so

71ff23c7-3b78-4da8-b007-12794a4f4d36-3
00:46:46.087 --> 00:46:50.961
all of those things, I think all
of those things that we saw are

71ff23c7-3b78-4da8-b007-12794a4f4d36-4
00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:55.760
in this picture. So it's a happy
family scene. And then over on

71ff23c7-3b78-4da8-b007-12794a4f4d36-5
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.359
the the.

de5188ca-2df9-4be7-bc39-85082adf8656-0
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.862
Right side we see the girl
putting on her boots. Um looks

de5188ca-2df9-4be7-bc39-85082adf8656-1
00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:09.192
like she's taking the dog. The
dog the pet with their can't

de5188ca-2df9-4be7-bc39-85082adf8656-2
00:47:09.192 --> 00:47:14.699
tell what that is. The pet is
handing her or has in his mouth

de5188ca-2df9-4be7-bc39-85082adf8656-3
00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:20.473
the girl's hat. So she puts her
hat on and goes outside into the

de5188ca-2df9-4be7-bc39-85082adf8656-4
00:47:20.473 --> 00:47:25.981
city, down the stair stairs it's
it's stairs. In the city the

de5188ca-2df9-4be7-bc39-85082adf8656-5
00:47:25.981 --> 00:47:27.580
walkway is stairs.

f5346b9e-6db6-46ce-b991-49e6b6b61344-0
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.980
And she's going with him to um.

28f42025-2f2d-40e7-bb50-f0e824883680-0
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:37.177
To find something, because she's
rushing and then she's there's

28f42025-2f2d-40e7-bb50-f0e824883680-1
00:47:37.177 --> 00:47:42.456
little things on the ground and
she's pointing at them. The next

28f42025-2f2d-40e7-bb50-f0e824883680-2
00:47:42.456 --> 00:47:47.410
thing you see is that she has
like a light, a ball of light.

1643efc7-19cc-47e2-b931-1326fe2b3717-0
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.391
#END_arrival-6 Coming from her
hand or she's reaching for it,

1643efc7-19cc-47e2-b931-1326fe2b3717-1
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:56.384
and I can't tell if those little
things on the ground turned into

1643efc7-19cc-47e2-b931-1326fe2b3717-2
00:47:56.384 --> 00:47:59.470
that or not. We'll find out. {I
guess we're good.}

b80ec8c4-10f6-48e6-89dd-b675a754ff14-0
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.410
{OK, So what a strange story.}

e2d2d7b7-45c1-4056-b589-6ff4d6a268ce-0
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:10.230
{Alright, go for another 25
minutes.

5b9c3976-8ebf-4bac-b256-277635367bc0-0
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:16.446
Alright, so this one is a
complex scene and just describe

5b9c3976-8ebf-4bac-b256-277635367bc0-1
00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:20.730
what you see and take between
three and five minutes.}

4258031b-1707-490c-8e98-810524de099e-0
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.060
{Ohh my goodness. Alright.}

8c48d7a8-87b5-45e3-b93f-443de6c62fa0-0
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.610
#START_picture_this This is.

9bf2feeb-861e-46d5-9134-364b4c26070d-0
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:45.000
A compilation on the whole page
of all of the framed portraits.

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-0
00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:50.108
It looks like the framed
portraits that we saw at the

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-1
00:48:50.108 --> 00:48:54.862
exhibition, I recognize a bunch
of them, but maybe not all,

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-2
00:48:54.862 --> 00:48:59.933
because the great big, huge one
is not there. And you know, I'm

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-3
00:48:59.933 --> 00:49:04.449
not going to be looking for
anything particular, but I I

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-4
00:49:04.449 --> 00:49:09.282
know that I saw a couple of a
bunch of these. So here we are

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-5
00:49:09.282 --> 00:49:13.719
with a bunch of framed
portraits, and I'm going to have

8824e3e2-fba3-403e-92c2-9fc436eb0ea9-6
00:49:13.719 --> 00:49:15.699
to really stretch myself.

54329bc0-e7cf-4d81-997e-d2ca4f6c4ba4-0
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.270
Say what these are.

a07b2a86-fff6-43a9-a2b8-c5729672caf0-0
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.900
Most of these portraits are in.

a1e931c1-7cd5-4e76-8234-d0364765df9b-0
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:30.070
Rectangular frames, in fact,
maybe all of them. And that's a

a1e931c1-7cd5-4e76-8234-d0364765df9b-1
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:35.204
big difference. They are all
sorts of portraits of people

a1e931c1-7cd5-4e76-8234-d0364765df9b-2
00:49:35.204 --> 00:49:39.807
doing different things,
including, well, there's an

a1e931c1-7cd5-4e76-8234-d0364765df9b-3
00:49:39.807 --> 00:49:45.296
animal doing nothing. But for
the most part it's people. Some

a1e931c1-7cd5-4e76-8234-d0364765df9b-4
00:49:45.296 --> 00:49:49.280
are dressed in outrageous
outfits, some are.

72e2ced8-132b-4f08-b707-2dd77a958d56-0
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:56.751
Just posing. Some are in
business clothes, some are with

72e2ced8-132b-4f08-b707-2dd77a958d56-1
00:49:56.751 --> 00:50:02.352
groups, and there are a lot of
animals. There are a lot of

72e2ced8-132b-4f08-b707-2dd77a958d56-2
00:50:02.352 --> 00:50:08.143
animals as well, sometimes just
portraits, sometimes because

72e2ced8-132b-4f08-b707-2dd77a958d56-3
00:50:08.143 --> 00:50:14.314
they're odd looking, several are
very odd looking, and some with

72e2ced8-132b-4f08-b707-2dd77a958d56-4
00:50:14.314 --> 00:50:20.295
people or just like a snapshot
of something that they are that

72e2ced8-132b-4f08-b707-2dd77a958d56-5
00:50:20.295 --> 00:50:20.770
they.

82bec510-af63-49f4-8aa8-6886873608c1-0
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:26.096
Thought they wanted to remember
that that they did, but most of

82bec510-af63-49f4-8aa8-6886873608c1-1
00:50:26.096 --> 00:50:31.189
them are not in pretty places. A
lot of times when you take a

82bec510-af63-49f4-8aa8-6886873608c1-2
00:50:31.189 --> 00:50:36.363
portrait, you put them in pretty
places. I see one with a palm

82bec510-af63-49f4-8aa8-6886873608c1-3
00:50:36.363 --> 00:50:41.538
tree, but it doesn't look like
it's it's there to be pretty. I

82bec510-af63-49f4-8aa8-6886873608c1-4
00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:46.466
see someone that looks like a
chef, but it's not the pretty

82bec510-af63-49f4-8aa8-6886873608c1-5
00:50:46.466 --> 00:50:50.820
part of being a chef. So it's
very odd to see these.

54f28e62-7b62-4542-884c-8c47de240b7c-0
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:56.295
Um, they're very active and a
lot of portraits are not active,

54f28e62-7b62-4542-884c-8c47de240b7c-1
00:50:56.295 --> 00:51:01.340
so this is like they wanted to
focus on what had happened.

e5760987-6ef4-463d-aceb-c06614f71b56-0
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:11.545
I only see one. I think that is,
um, like a it's a black and

e5760987-6ef4-463d-aceb-c06614f71b56-1
00:51:11.545 --> 00:51:12.180
white.

bb1604fd-18db-4744-a5fa-b7dd73d0b772-0
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:14.500
I see one that's.

7b3ae326-3bec-4be1-9804-22129f9ef0ed-0
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:19.888
Like a it's totally white on a
blue background. You can't even

7b3ae326-3bec-4be1-9804-22129f9ef0ed-1
00:51:19.888 --> 00:51:24.374
see that there's a person. You
just see a shape. It's like an

7b3ae326-3bec-4be1-9804-22129f9ef0ed-2
00:51:24.374 --> 00:51:27.920
outline. It's like a silhouette
that's reversed.

feac3345-907c-4f1a-94da-4f01e96617c2-0
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:34.810
But this is a hard hard one to
describe because, um.

472b95cd-8acd-43c2-884e-a3617c28cf1c-0
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.670
Everyone's unique.

aa0d1f52-ecd8-43f1-8f69-43332582e551-0
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:42.370
And they don't have any
particular, they're just a

aa0d1f52-ecd8-43f1-8f69-43332582e551-1
00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:45.924
conglomeration. But it's
interesting that there is a

aa0d1f52-ecd8-43f1-8f69-43332582e551-2
00:51:45.924 --> 00:51:46.260
bird.

c6c3e6d5-721a-4820-9ee3-b72f4beda970-0
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:53.503
Flying to the left like it's
flying out of this mess of

c6c3e6d5-721a-4820-9ee3-b72f4beda970-1
00:51:53.503 --> 00:51:56.840
pictures. And then there's a.

4e6d3674-a103-4899-a1be-22967a7f80af-0
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.042
It almost looked like a caveman
at first, but it doesn't appear

4e6d3674-a103-4899-a1be-22967a7f80af-1
00:52:03.042 --> 00:52:06.080
to be. It appears to be someone
like in a bathing suit.

2d273f0c-fb19-4f25-8520-dba9db8764d0-0
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:12.180
#END_picture_this Over on the
bottom right, walking away from

2d273f0c-fb19-4f25-8520-dba9db8764d0-1
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:16.662
this as well. So you know, maybe
these are a little more alive

2d273f0c-fb19-4f25-8520-dba9db8764d0-2
00:52:16.662 --> 00:52:21.286
than how they appear. This man's
walking out of it and the birds

2d273f0c-fb19-4f25-8520-dba9db8764d0-3
00:52:21.286 --> 00:52:22.140
flying away.

403c0fce-c5b9-42f2-bd0c-911bf3201351-0
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:26.840
{All right. Well, we will do the
next one.

0c30e190-bfc3-4abd-b85b-ab90b066622f-0
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:32.580
You guys are picking some crazy
things, yeah.}

55fb7652-8864-4e90-bf15-76e46f9b4762-0
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:38.167
#START_deep_sea_diver Alright,
here we are. Where's Waldo again

55fb7652-8864-4e90-bf15-76e46f9b4762-1
00:52:38.167 --> 00:52:41.680
And this is the deep sea diver,
so this is actually pretty cool.

449014e5-6ca1-42f8-8be8-47844bc3164f-0
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:49.513
Well, it's cool because it's a
cutaway section of water and

449014e5-6ca1-42f8-8be8-47844bc3164f-1
00:52:49.513 --> 00:52:54.915
like the sea and what people do
above the sea when they're

449014e5-6ca1-42f8-8be8-47844bc3164f-2
00:52:54.915 --> 00:53:00.042
fishing and trying to get
something from under the sea.

449014e5-6ca1-42f8-8be8-47844bc3164f-3
00:53:00.042 --> 00:53:05.810
And then 2/3 of the picture is
under the sea and you're seeing

449014e5-6ca1-42f8-8be8-47844bc3164f-4
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:11.212
life under the sea. You've got
divers down there. You have

449014e5-6ca1-42f8-8be8-47844bc3164f-5
00:53:11.212 --> 00:53:11.670
well.

7a0d1922-4319-417a-944e-90866b179dda-0
00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:14.570
Mermaids down there.

a56ed8e6-ef4b-4638-82ef-187218b52a1f-0
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:20.878
I guess most of the rest have to
be divers if they're not

a56ed8e6-ef4b-4638-82ef-187218b52a1f-1
00:53:20.878 --> 00:53:23.200
mermaids, fishermen with Spears.

53365f3b-4acf-4581-80ad-ca2d925f8967-0
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.820
Spear guns and.

c11a497a-0d85-47dd-9a21-71d61db4284f-0
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:32.579
Lots of fishing lines from the
boats, what they're trying to

c11a497a-0d85-47dd-9a21-71d61db4284f-1
00:53:32.579 --> 00:53:37.774
do. So the boats are all above
and there's a whole lot of them

c11a497a-0d85-47dd-9a21-71d61db4284f-2
00:53:37.774 --> 00:53:40.660
and it looks like there are a
few.

d970d72e-f3cc-4590-9a19-d2dcf4c751c8-0
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.930
Big Rocks coming out of this.

358d20e4-ac37-4f3d-b060-c117b7b80775-0
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:53.271
Waterway where they are, and one
of the rocks has a whole bunch

358d20e4-ac37-4f3d-b060-c117b7b80775-1
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:59.133
of mermaids on it and the other
rocks have people fishing off of

358d20e4-ac37-4f3d-b060-c117b7b80775-2
00:53:59.133 --> 00:54:04.274
them. I only see one mermaid
rock. Most of the boats are

358d20e4-ac37-4f3d-b060-c117b7b80775-3
00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:09.775
little rowboat fishing boats.
Maybe they have a little motor

358d20e4-ac37-4f3d-b060-c117b7b80775-4
00:54:09.775 --> 00:54:15.186
on the back, but they're not
fancy. They're all striped and

358d20e4-ac37-4f3d-b060-c117b7b80775-5
00:54:15.186 --> 00:54:16.720
different colors.

54f9dc53-f729-4066-96f4-aae0d4442c4f-0
00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:22.099
And most of them have more than
one person in them. And this

54f9dc53-f729-4066-96f4-aae0d4442c4f-1
00:54:22.099 --> 00:54:27.387
goes back, goes pretty far back.
Except I see a ship way in the

54f9dc53-f729-4066-96f4-aae0d4442c4f-2
00:54:27.387 --> 00:54:31.270
background, but this must be the
fishing area.

a3b2bf9a-5708-4e38-b2b2-f2ec50d481b7-0
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:39.126
One of them has a sail and maybe
that's what that what I said was

a3b2bf9a-5708-4e38-b2b2-f2ec50d481b7-1
00:54:39.126 --> 00:54:45.165
a ship is in the back. It's just
a rowboat with a a sale on it

a3b2bf9a-5708-4e38-b2b2-f2ec50d481b7-2
00:54:45.165 --> 00:54:50.916
and I don't see any but that one
and the one way far in the

a3b2bf9a-5708-4e38-b2b2-f2ec50d481b7-3
00:54:50.916 --> 00:54:56.859
background but underneath what a
crazy world and and you know

a3b2bf9a-5708-4e38-b2b2-f2ec50d481b7-4
00:54:56.859 --> 00:55:02.706
that is probably so true. It's
like looking into an aquarium

a3b2bf9a-5708-4e38-b2b2-f2ec50d481b7-5
00:55:02.706 --> 00:55:03.090
and.

f79cbd4c-cb5b-4b3c-a39b-6e070b35a071-0
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:08.098
There's an octopus down at the
bottom and couple different

f79cbd4c-cb5b-4b3c-a39b-6e070b35a071-1
00:55:08.098 --> 00:55:12.550
kinds of coral and this great
big scary looking flatfish.

7c222f95-aeda-46bc-b153-f9e2333f1079-0
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:20.070
There's treasures and seaweed.

def59463-0439-43ed-9f61-5335ed4234cd-0
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:24.390
And old things and clams.

425e4940-a840-4f66-a0d9-a6a17980521b-0
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:30.490
Uh, what do you call those
jellyfish?

c0600d28-d1c3-4649-ae5f-4dde5d66219d-0
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:36.850
And fish of all kinds. There's a
saw. Fish. Oh, there's a little.

7101c6a9-28dc-4a7f-8773-5bc0c49a22f2-0
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:46.790
Looks like ohh gosh like a
Captain Nemo kind of underwater.

ec6cee9f-e088-4078-b627-b5aee805ae48-0
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:54.164
Capsule over on the left and
mostly you're seeing a lot of

ec6cee9f-e088-4078-b627-b5aee805ae48-1
00:55:54.164 --> 00:56:00.826
people under the water, which is
really crazy because there would

ec6cee9f-e088-4078-b627-b5aee805ae48-2
00:56:00.826 --> 00:56:07.386
never be that many people under
the water in one place and there

ec6cee9f-e088-4078-b627-b5aee805ae48-3
00:56:07.386 --> 00:56:08.800
is a big fish.

2a0c788b-85d8-4e2d-a133-1cf9cc3caf4d-0
00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:15.770
That is very camouflaged to look
like it's part of everything.

af1b2ad9-b641-4f66-a4f4-e45ac9197700-0
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.058
And it's eating something that
was already on somebody's line.

af1b2ad9-b641-4f66-a4f4-e45ac9197700-1
00:56:23.058 --> 00:56:23.950
There are.

ab410179-7f07-437c-99b0-97b83bedc3ad-0
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:30.080
Arrows that appear to be made
of.

7e2bd048-6ebf-42e1-83e3-d0d737acbb20-0
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:36.249
Fish either. Little fish. Yeah,
they are. And then there's a

7e2bd048-6ebf-42e1-83e3-d0d737acbb20-1
00:56:36.249 --> 00:56:41.246
clown face made of little fish,
little red fish, and you can see

7e2bd048-6ebf-42e1-83e3-d0d737acbb20-2
00:56:41.246 --> 00:56:46.090
eyes in a different color for
the nose. Very interesting. Like

7e2bd048-6ebf-42e1-83e3-d0d737acbb20-3
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:50.780
they want this to be something
that they do under the water.

acf492f0-cdb4-4f8e-a2ac-ff10207fdd44-0
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.916
Other than that, it's just you
see little schools of fish and

acf492f0-cdb4-4f8e-a2ac-ff10207fdd44-1
00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:03.093
fish of all colors. I guess
that's the biggest thing.

acf492f0-cdb4-4f8e-a2ac-ff10207fdd44-2
00:57:03.093 --> 00:57:07.966
Everything is brightly colored
from yellows and Reds and pinks

acf492f0-cdb4-4f8e-a2ac-ff10207fdd44-3
00:57:07.966 --> 00:57:09.050
and Blues and.

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:42.950
Now as I read this little thing,
this is kind of silly. It says.

14c0a32c-a56b-493b-9ba3-684b04f1e6a6-0
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:51.197
The lake is a perfect place for
Penguins to lay back and relax

14c0a32c-a56b-493b-9ba3-684b04f1e6a6-1
00:57:51.197 --> 00:57:57.424
in the sunshine. Well I would
never think of that. So now it's

14c0a32c-a56b-493b-9ba3-684b04f1e6a6-2
00:57:57.424 --> 00:58:02.959
going to make me look for
Penguins. And I don't know if

14c0a32c-a56b-493b-9ba3-684b04f1e6a6-3
00:58:02.959 --> 00:58:08.495
there are Penguins, but here's
what we have a beautiful

14c0a32c-a56b-493b-9ba3-684b04f1e6a6-4
00:58:08.495 --> 00:58:14.425
lakeside scene. It's quite
contained. We can see almost ohh

14c0a32c-a56b-493b-9ba3-684b04f1e6a6-5
00:58:14.425 --> 00:58:14.919
gosh.

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:20.971
we can see a long ways, but we
see the end of the lake and like

d08d2093-5175-41d3-9622-0ce2d7581aee-1
00:58:20.971 --> 00:58:26.579
around Cove and then where the
lake would head out it, it's

d08d2093-5175-41d3-9622-0ce2d7581aee-2
00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:31.814
further away. So there are
magnificent homes along this

d08d2093-5175-41d3-9622-0ce2d7581aee-3
00:58:31.814 --> 00:58:37.796
lake, but the part where where
that we see closest to us is the

d08d2093-5175-41d3-9622-0ce2d7581aee-4
00:58:37.796 --> 00:58:43.684
beach part. So the lake itself
has a lot of homes on it. There

d08d2093-5175-41d3-9622-0ce2d7581aee-5
00:58:43.684 --> 00:58:45.180
are other boats.

e107704a-3860-447d-916c-fda2192e2685-0
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.020
Way out on the lake.

420c1585-fbbe-47c7-8220-dbef7a8a6e06-0
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:53.379
There are para sailors and
there's one that's really big, I

420c1585-fbbe-47c7-8220-dbef7a8a6e06-1
00:58:53.379 --> 00:58:58.946
don't know what ohh windsurfers.
So the parasailor is the multi

420c1585-fbbe-47c7-8220-dbef7a8a6e06-2
00:58:58.946 --> 00:59:04.340
colored one and the windsurfers
are out by the sailboats. And

420c1585-fbbe-47c7-8220-dbef7a8a6e06-3
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.907
there are water skiers in a very
tall pyramid, a whole bunch of

420c1585-fbbe-47c7-8220-dbef7a8a6e06-4
00:59:09.907 --> 00:59:15.388
them. There's a Viking looking
boat that has rollers on it, so

420c1585-fbbe-47c7-8220-dbef7a8a6e06-5
00:59:15.388 --> 00:59:19.390
it's probably a crew team.
There's a kayaker.

5969f3cf-d328-4d8a-8201-2416a695573d-0
00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:24.830
Um, someone on on a stand up
paddle board? Um.

ce293496-736c-4f40-8123-c9e91fe918b4-0
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:31.630
Big floats, little floats, inner
tubes.

aaa22fad-5f8f-4dd1-8d24-109558368281-0
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:36.745
People are out there doing, oh,
and a jet ski. People are out

aaa22fad-5f8f-4dd1-8d24-109558368281-1
00:59:36.745 --> 00:59:40.931
there doing all kinds of things.
And a paddle boat where two

aaa22fad-5f8f-4dd1-8d24-109558368281-2
00:59:40.931 --> 00:59:44.911
people are sitting in it and
they just, they just bicycle

aaa22fad-5f8f-4dd1-8d24-109558368281-3
00:59:44.911 --> 00:59:46.010
with their feet.

81dfa0fb-0fc9-4d38-bff8-702930dc39cc-0
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.820
So it's, um, yeah, a couple of
little catamarans.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.133
Of course, they all really
wouldn't be in this small space,

8ad21060-672b-4725-81ea-6da2f26fa83b-1
00:59:57.133 --> 01:00:02.000
but it's it's makes a good
picture. Yes. So then on the

8ad21060-672b-4725-81ea-6da2f26fa83b-2
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.866
shore you've got to the right
side by a more of a lodge

8ad21060-672b-4725-81ea-6da2f26fa83b-3
01:00:06.866 --> 01:00:12.428
looking place. You have what is
probably a family that has been

8ad21060-672b-4725-81ea-6da2f26fa83b-4
01:00:12.428 --> 01:00:17.641
barbecuing or eating outside.
Somebody has a spatula in his

8ad21060-672b-4725-81ea-6da2f26fa83b-5
01:00:17.641 --> 01:00:21.899
hand and there's a table there.
And then people.

e505c292-ddc1-46b2-9787-de67fcfce341-0
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.724
Are on a big rock watching
what's going on. There's some

e505c292-ddc1-46b2-9787-de67fcfce341-1
01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:28.140
kids on bicycles.

8670831d-1e58-424e-8baf-bf6417dc0293-0
01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:34.632
Doing um, acrobatics and then as
you get closer to the beach you

8670831d-1e58-424e-8baf-bf6417dc0293-1
01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:38.864
just see little groups of
people, families and people out

8670831d-1e58-424e-8baf-bf6417dc0293-2
01:00:38.864 --> 01:00:42.804
on a dock. Fishing from a dock,
there's a swan in the

8670831d-1e58-424e-8baf-bf6417dc0293-3
01:00:42.804 --> 01:00:45.650
background. That's pretty
interesting.

359e088e-e757-4fb3-87ba-53c354b9cdb8-0
01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.682
Um, you get closer to the beach
and you see sandcastles being

359e088e-e757-4fb3-87ba-53c354b9cdb8-1
01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:58.924
built by a whole group of
people. You see a little tidal

359e088e-e757-4fb3-87ba-53c354b9cdb8-2
01:00:58.924 --> 01:01:04.350
pool where the smaller kids can
be playing safely. You see

359e088e-e757-4fb3-87ba-53c354b9cdb8-3
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:10.328
umbrellas and people under them
having picnics and doing various

359e088e-e757-4fb3-87ba-53c354b9cdb8-4
01:01:10.328 --> 01:01:16.306
things with their food. And and
there's a big trash can. There's

359e088e-e757-4fb3-87ba-53c354b9cdb8-5
01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:17.870
somebody playing.

c74cf603-c037-4eba-a2cc-7d9d661a822d-0
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:22.535
With a truck on the water, I
mean on the sand and shovels,

c74cf603-c037-4eba-a2cc-7d9d661a822d-1
01:01:22.535 --> 01:01:26.820
there's someone on a people
mover. That's interesting.

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-0
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:32.648
Somebody's got a kite, uh, maybe
even a couple of kites, and

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-1
01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:37.410
going all the way around toward
the left. There's just more and

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-2
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:41.800
more people. There's a boat on
the beach and lots, lots of

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-3
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.413
people. It's not very relaxing
by this lake. There's a lot of

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-4
01:01:46.413 --> 01:01:50.654
people, they're playing
volleyball over on the left, and

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-5
01:01:50.654 --> 01:01:55.267
there is somebody trying to sun
over on the very far left and

2e647957-bc5e-4459-9cc9-4d500e08f564-6
01:01:55.267 --> 01:01:58.019
sitting in a chair just watching
it.

3fd618f9-65e3-43ea-aea5-1086e8885148-0
01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.400
{All.

566d467b-28a4-473f-8d77-442e6c140cbf-0
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.090
Yeah, already got it. Yes, good.

ae7ef579-4c7d-4cce-908d-68d2c00d00b3-0
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.949
OK, this will be the final one.
It's about 20 pages. You will

ae7ef579-4c7d-4cce-908d-68d2c00d00b3-1
01:02:09.949 --> 01:02:14.407
find it to look a little
familiar. OK, tell the story as

ae7ef579-4c7d-4cce-908d-68d2c00d00b3-2
01:02:14.407 --> 01:02:15.190
we go on.}

8b176691-5e4d-4322-af18-d1327238dc51-0
01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.000
{Ohh.

a723aa97-d7fc-4399-ac87-25e58af69ddd-0
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.360
All right.

d6f5b842-fd3c-4f8e-887c-bb735fb5cda5-0
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.580
So.}

f0734c4c-2ce9-4f00-a670-3c48336b1dca-0
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.080
#START_quest We've seen these
two before.

8a25e72f-0944-4a0d-89df-2e3fdf063fec-0
01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:33.302
And um, but it looks like this
is the beginning of another

8a25e72f-0944-4a0d-89df-2e3fdf063fec-1
01:02:33.302 --> 01:02:35.800
story about them. So this is.

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-0
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.838
All in sepia tones except for
the children. And these are the

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-1
01:02:40.838 --> 01:02:45.206
children that had the crayons.
Excuse me. The girl had the red

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-2
01:02:45.206 --> 01:02:49.296
crayon and the boy had the
purple crayon and their bicycle

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-3
01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:53.594
with the purple and red wheels
as there is there and they are

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-4
01:02:53.594 --> 01:02:57.823
under an arched bridge with big
statues around it and a park

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-5
01:02:57.823 --> 01:03:02.052
bench. It it does appear that
it's a park. There are statues

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-6
01:03:02.052 --> 01:03:06.282
on both sides, park benches on
both sides, and street lights

20729123-8c29-4163-9c62-939b8a65c2d1-7
01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:06.489
on.

b309d586-34e8-4e08-ab37-332bf3824bdc-0
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:11.206
Both sides, so they are
underneath, next to a fancy door

b309d586-34e8-4e08-ab37-332bf3824bdc-1
01:03:11.206 --> 01:03:13.000
and under a spotlight.

fa368386-6716-4f4f-b6b3-cf262679345c-0
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.590
{And that's OK.} And he was just
reaching to feel the rain. I

fa368386-6716-4f4f-b6b3-cf262679345c-1
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.990
think it's raining. Go ahead.

477204de-ee91-4b88-becd-f58dac62545e-0
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:29.709
So out of that fancy door comes
a king looking person and he and

477204de-ee91-4b88-becd-f58dac62545e-1
01:03:29.709 --> 01:03:35.772
he actually startles the kids
may have knocked them over and

477204de-ee91-4b88-becd-f58dac62545e-2
01:03:35.772 --> 01:03:39.350
the purple bird is flying up
above.

3c42338b-5fcd-4bf1-a9a6-2753169bccb0-0
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:45.940
The kids. And he hands them what
looks like a map.

72b2c068-e6aa-49ef-80cc-e34da5524802-0
01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.719
So on the right side we have
those 3 little diagrams again

72b2c068-e6aa-49ef-80cc-e34da5524802-1
01:03:51.719 --> 01:03:56.278
that are just the drawings and
you see the king has given the

72b2c068-e6aa-49ef-80cc-e34da5524802-2
01:03:56.278 --> 01:04:00.544
map to the boy and is pointing
in the direction that they

72b2c068-e6aa-49ef-80cc-e34da5524802-3
01:04:00.544 --> 01:04:05.325
should go. The Purple bird is on
the boy's shoulder and the girl

72b2c068-e6aa-49ef-80cc-e34da5524802-4
01:04:05.325 --> 01:04:09.370
is talking is watching the king
or getting up I guess.

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-0
01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:15.562
So then the next one in the
middle, those guards are pulling

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-1
01:04:15.562 --> 01:04:20.212
the king, pulling them back in,
and he has an orange crayon in

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-2
01:04:20.212 --> 01:04:24.420
his hand. I didn't see that
before, but he has an orange

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-3
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.996
crayon in his hand and it flies
out of his hand and they pull

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-4
01:04:28.996 --> 01:04:33.573
him back in and the kids back
away and the birds still flying

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-5
01:04:33.573 --> 01:04:38.075
up above in the first picture.
And then the guards bring the

0a98cd21-a67d-4416-9611-05029af2d036-6
01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:41.249
king right back into that
doorway and the.

3ab24ee7-b6b4-4e3b-989c-42a35e51aa09-0
01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.794
Orange crayon had fallen out of
his hand and it's on the ground

3ab24ee7-b6b4-4e3b-989c-42a35e51aa09-1
01:04:44.794 --> 01:04:48.105
and the girl and the boy both
see it, and the bird is on the

3ab24ee7-b6b4-4e3b-989c-42a35e51aa09-2
01:04:48.105 --> 01:04:48.920
boy's shoulder.

fa13ca0f-d435-4c95-8c25-59997aa9d5d2-0
01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.107
So now the girl picks up the
orange crayon and puts it in her

fa13ca0f-d435-4c95-8c25-59997aa9d5d2-1
01:04:57.107 --> 01:05:01.684
belt that is across her
shoulders diagonally. The doors

fa13ca0f-d435-4c95-8c25-59997aa9d5d2-2
01:05:01.684 --> 01:05:06.915
are closed and you can't see the
king anymore. The boy looks at

fa13ca0f-d435-4c95-8c25-59997aa9d5d2-3
01:05:06.915 --> 01:05:11.656
his purple crayon and I guess
they're thinking what to do

fa13ca0f-d435-4c95-8c25-59997aa9d5d2-4
01:05:11.656 --> 01:05:14.190
next. He has the map rolled up.

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-0
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.605
In his hand the bird is on his
shoulder. And as we go to the

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-1
01:05:19.605 --> 01:05:24.485
next page, where there are those
three drawings, again with no

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-2
01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:28.824
background, and the bird is
flying and the children are

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-3
01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:33.627
drawing, she is drawing up in
the air with her red crayon and

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-4
01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:38.740
he is drawing on the ground with
his purple crayon. And then they

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-5
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.775
the next thing you can see that
what they've each drawn is a key

a9c8fb51-ea89-4256-acd9-c87fa975e595-6
01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:44.859
and the birds.

22985597-0833-4952-a5f9-852a75d4571f-0
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:48.816
On the ground, looking up at
them. And so they put their

22985597-0833-4952-a5f9-852a75d4571f-1
01:05:48.816 --> 01:05:52.770
keys, one in each side of the
door and the door opens and

22985597-0833-4952-a5f9-852a75d4571f-2
01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:56.180
they're all going in, the birds
flying over them.

2492e230-b299-4267-a472-c347864c8bd8-0
01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.650
OK.

07ce6791-7ce2-4089-b12e-2c6206b21634-0
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.748
Well, I see the children in
there, but I don't see where

07ce6791-7ce2-4089-b12e-2c6206b21634-1
01:06:07.748 --> 01:06:11.337
they came from. So they
apparently went to where they

07ce6791-7ce2-4089-b12e-2c6206b21634-2
01:06:11.337 --> 01:06:15.325
could see the king and they
they're sitting at underneath a

07ce6791-7ce2-4089-b12e-2c6206b21634-3
01:06:15.325 --> 01:06:15.990
waterfall.

e27617d7-88b4-4882-a858-73b97e7df146-0
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.360
Ohh.

7363dc92-81e8-46ac-aea5-0a521e04ef26-0
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:25.010
No, maybe they came in through
that rock that looks like a a

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-0
01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.815
An animal. So that may be where
the door went, but they're

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-1
01:06:29.815 --> 01:06:33.651
sitting over there now
underneath a waterfall, and the

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-2
01:06:33.651 --> 01:06:37.557
birds with them and they're
watching and this is all in

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-3
01:06:37.557 --> 01:06:41.951
color now. They're watching as
this big boat with guards on it

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-4
01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:46.415
takes the king in the direction
opposite of them. It's a paddle

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-5
01:06:46.415 --> 01:06:50.600
boat and we're in that big city
like we've seen before, and

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-6
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.785
they're flying machines up in
the air. They're actually the

74221704-09cd-4a36-a5fa-d771546a783c-7
01:06:54.785 --> 01:06:56.180
ones that look like.

d4f6fdec-4862-4568-bb33-7a9d363d01c6-0
01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.790
blimps

816b8d56-dba6-46c8-99b3-8bea1adf9f69-0
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.070
So the boat is disappearing.
Everything's in color.

0d6f7f6b-35fd-4629-85a2-2cd5ba4247ee-0
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.260
And they.

ecd8db95-8609-4c0d-97f9-339c48f35d6f-0
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.530
Wow.

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-0
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:20.031
Um, they are trying to decide
what to do with this. Yeah, OK,

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-1
01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:24.662
I'm going to say that it looks
like they're stepping on fire.

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-2
01:07:24.662 --> 01:07:29.293
That's a little strange, but
there are, there are fires up in

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-3
01:07:29.293 --> 01:07:33.999
the upper part of the picture
coming from various places, so I

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-4
01:07:33.999 --> 01:07:38.854
don't know if it's a reflection
or what. They don't appear to be

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-5
01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:43.560
concerned about that, so it's
probably not bothering them. The

cb74fbcd-a3b4-45eb-9b7e-4bbcda87b0dd-6
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.100
bird is looking down toward
that.

2c4f2611-661a-474c-b1cb-16bc52363660-0
01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:46.510
So.

e2d01910-aad4-4d0e-8381-738d91fe8028-0
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:54.010
The next thing is a close up of
the map and you see like a

e2d01910-aad4-4d0e-8381-738d91fe8028-1
01:07:54.010 --> 01:08:00.186
rainbow around it. And every and
there's six circles, and the map

e2d01910-aad4-4d0e-8381-738d91fe8028-2
01:08:00.186 --> 01:08:05.800
has the whole background is the
map, and the circles have a

e2d01910-aad4-4d0e-8381-738d91fe8028-3
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.321
close up of things that are on
the map, and they're all in

e2d01910-aad4-4d0e-8381-738d91fe8028-4
01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:13.380
colors of the rainbow.

2be0100a-f189-4785-8f6c-e5ce042981cc-0
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.370
Going around.

503ef55d-1617-4911-9d7a-916cb6c800ca-0
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:25.345
So now the girl has no the boy
has the map in his hand, the

503ef55d-1617-4911-9d7a-916cb6c800ca-1
01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:31.156
bird is flying, and we see boats
that look like Viking boats

503ef55d-1617-4911-9d7a-916cb6c800ca-2
01:08:31.156 --> 01:08:37.443
coming down the river of kind of
in the direction they're they're

503ef55d-1617-4911-9d7a-916cb6c800ca-3
01:08:37.443 --> 01:08:43.444
going into the direction where
the king had gone. I don't know

503ef55d-1617-4911-9d7a-916cb6c800ca-4
01:08:43.444 --> 01:08:47.159
if they're still going to
follow, but.

9f327630-6fd7-4a17-bf68-12b469a3aeaf-0
01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:52.618
It looks like they've been
setting these things on fire.

9f327630-6fd7-4a17-bf68-12b469a3aeaf-1
01:08:52.618 --> 01:08:58.224
That's how it looks to me. So
you have the next page has the

9f327630-6fd7-4a17-bf68-12b469a3aeaf-2
01:08:58.224 --> 01:09:03.830
three drawings again, and the
boy and girl are deciding what

9f327630-6fd7-4a17-bf68-12b469a3aeaf-3
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:09.436
they're going to draw, what they
need to do to make the next

9f327630-6fd7-4a17-bf68-12b469a3aeaf-4
01:09:09.436 --> 01:09:14.766
thing they need. And so she
they're making flippers to to

9f327630-6fd7-4a17-bf68-12b469a3aeaf-5
01:09:14.766 --> 01:09:18.810
swim with and probably some sort
of helmet.

2c76d051-5d2c-48d3-aac9-d84431aa6edc-0
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.130
That's what it looks like. And a
scuba helmet and a.

899e00fd-d616-43d3-bfa9-8532148220cd-0
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:28.020
Um, a scuba tank and so the
bird.

f11ee0b7-8d2c-49e3-bc98-3636e70f9818-0
01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.000
Is that still the bird?

1f025997-425b-43a0-9ebe-1a4e85827ae6-0
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:36.072
I don't know, it looks like he's
making a a monster for going

1f025997-425b-43a0-9ebe-1a4e85827ae6-1
01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:40.220
under the sea with that's what
it looks like because the birds

1f025997-425b-43a0-9ebe-1a4e85827ae6-2
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.236
plumage, the bird is on his
shoulder and then but it's being

1f025997-425b-43a0-9ebe-1a4e85827ae6-3
01:09:44.236 --> 01:09:46.080
made with the purple crayon.

2cb8a0f6-e6bd-445d-8722-5631ded4d8ad-0
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.660
And yes, we have this underwater
strange looking.

08daae88-12e6-43a9-bed6-db8dc20ec437-0
01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:59.539
Octopus, because it has
tentacles. So he was working on

08daae88-12e6-43a9-bed6-db8dc20ec437-1
01:09:59.539 --> 01:10:03.993
that while she was working on
their scuba gear, and the bird

08daae88-12e6-43a9-bed6-db8dc20ec437-2
01:10:03.993 --> 01:10:08.667
even has a scuba tank on. And so
we're now underwater with this

08daae88-12e6-43a9-bed6-db8dc20ec437-3
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:12.683
gorgeous scene, mostly in
purples, and they're heading

08daae88-12e6-43a9-bed6-db8dc20ec437-4
01:10:12.683 --> 01:10:17.284
toward this pavilion, which is
one of the pictures that was on

08daae88-12e6-43a9-bed6-db8dc20ec437-5
01:10:17.284 --> 01:10:21.520
the map pavilion is in gold. So
they get to the pavilion.

51ad5645-ab6b-49eb-a76d-fd825649c4a0-0
01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.883
And there is a seashell on a
pedestal made of seahorses, and

51ad5645-ab6b-49eb-a76d-fd825649c4a0-1
01:10:28.883 --> 01:10:33.110
there's coral all around, and
the bird is up above them.

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-0
01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:40.010
Um, but the boy and girl go and
take something out of the center

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-1
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:45.032
of this seashell that's on a
pedestal. And the next picture,

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-2
01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:49.806
the next page is a drawing
showing them holding on to the

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-3
01:10:49.806 --> 01:10:54.827
tentacles of the purple octopus,
the boys looking at the map

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-4
01:10:54.827 --> 01:10:59.931
again, and whatever they had
taken the girl is putting in her

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-5
01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:04.459
belt. And there are some of
those guards that now have

dcf34187-90b4-47d2-a12a-4e1d97dbb5a0-6
01:11:04.459 --> 01:11:05.200
flippers.

770922ed-c1ee-4979-abdc-170236f6915a-0
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:09.450
On and Spears in their hands,
and they are all.

2839ee9c-ab7a-4f4b-87dc-4d8b25dae033-0
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:15.368
Chasing them underwater and
though the front guard is the

2839ee9c-ab7a-4f4b-87dc-4d8b25dae033-1
01:11:15.368 --> 01:11:19.869
one with the gold thing on his
head, I don't know why, but he's

2839ee9c-ab7a-4f4b-87dc-4d8b25dae033-2
01:11:19.869 --> 01:11:22.259
obviously a captain or
something.

75f0b2eb-48bd-4b7e-a998-d167f6d2c46b-0
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:31.208
When the kids get out of the
water they are on what looks

75f0b2eb-48bd-4b7e-a998-d167f6d2c46b-1
01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:35.732
like a lovely desert island.
There's mountains in the

75f0b2eb-48bd-4b7e-a998-d167f6d2c46b-2
01:11:35.732 --> 01:11:40.926
background and they are now out
of the water and there's palm

75f0b2eb-48bd-4b7e-a998-d167f6d2c46b-3
01:11:40.926 --> 01:11:46.119
trees all over that island and
the bird is flying above them.

75f0b2eb-48bd-4b7e-a998-d167f6d2c46b-4
01:11:46.119 --> 01:11:51.229
So the next page is a drawing
again and you see the children

75f0b2eb-48bd-4b7e-a998-d167f6d2c46b-5
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.900
drawing.

699095aa-a0d2-4ebf-8634-7a08d0cc4986-0
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.380
A purple animal.

fc805671-aa14-4c8f-82c0-5901fe0bec33-0
01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.536
And the boy is drawing a purple
animal and she is drawing like a

fc805671-aa14-4c8f-82c0-5901fe0bec33-1
01:12:02.536 --> 01:12:06.080
blanket for them to sit on on
this animal.

8d161c57-266a-4a05-9633-b570a6e8c311-0
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:19.437
OK, so now we see where they are
and they are on this island with

8d161c57-266a-4a05-9633-b570a6e8c311-1
01:12:19.437 --> 01:12:27.198
a big castle, kind of Aztec
castle on it, where it has lots

8d161c57-266a-4a05-9633-b570a6e8c311-2
01:12:27.198 --> 01:12:35.218
of layers in a pyramid and big
stairs going up it and they're

8d161c57-266a-4a05-9633-b570a6e8c311-3
01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:36.899
on a pathway.

303034fb-588c-4cc5-b917-f1d4660ce834-0
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.599
Going very fast on a purple
rhinoceros who's throwing up the

303034fb-588c-4cc5-b917-f1d4660ce834-1
01:12:41.599 --> 01:12:45.600
dust behind him, and they're
sitting in a red canopy.

204fafdd-6b15-44f5-bbcd-9cc589587212-0
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.500
Heading toward that, uh, the
next page shows. Uh.

9397d144-1f94-4c89-b15e-51d95d79ecec-0
01:12:53.220 --> 01:13:00.486
Broader view of where they are
and you see out into the water

9397d144-1f94-4c89-b15e-51d95d79ecec-1
01:13:00.486 --> 01:13:07.402
and there is a an even larger
I'll call it an Aztec temple

9397d144-1f94-4c89-b15e-51d95d79ecec-2
01:13:07.402 --> 01:13:14.903
with the same shape but it's got
a a taller tower on it that it

9397d144-1f94-4c89-b15e-51d95d79ecec-3
01:13:14.903 --> 01:13:22.053
is turning gold and that tower
has hanging ropes to a higher

9397d144-1f94-4c89-b15e-51d95d79ecec-4
01:13:22.053 --> 01:13:23.459
part of the.

df5b4b1f-5c54-4b23-b3f7-ec7ad070e894-0
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:29.960
Mountain Island and it looks
like it was a rope.

5d556d9e-ff16-40aa-9940-fc294d054fe1-0
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:38.180
A bridge that is no longer able
to be transversed.

6f1dd439-f07b-42f5-8491-3668cfe80e46-0
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:44.780
Yeah, now we have a close up of
this raggedy.

e2ccc96b-2f42-4da2-8e53-8252e0f88d47-0
01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.513
Raggedy bridge. But the base of
it seems to be have enough

e2ccc96b-2f42-4da2-8e53-8252e0f88d47-1
01:13:51.513 --> 01:13:56.929
planks that the kids are going
from the the mountainside of the

e2ccc96b-2f42-4da2-8e53-8252e0f88d47-2
01:13:56.929 --> 01:14:02.092
desert island across to this
tower that I had just described

e2ccc96b-2f42-4da2-8e53-8252e0f88d47-3
01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:07.593
and the birds flying above them.
And there are many, many looks.

e2ccc96b-2f42-4da2-8e53-8252e0f88d47-4
01:14:07.593 --> 01:14:13.094
Well, looks like there's lots of
birds in the sky flying around,

e2ccc96b-2f42-4da2-8e53-8252e0f88d47-5
01:14:13.094 --> 01:14:16.479
but maybe it's just outlines of
clouds.

f5b38d71-4389-4a12-a27d-ed8b627c72e4-0
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:21.513
But that bridge is very raggedy
and I would it looks like some

f5b38d71-4389-4a12-a27d-ed8b627c72e4-1
01:14:21.513 --> 01:14:23.480
of the planks are missing.

b2c213d1-58e9-4456-b52d-135c06b0d926-0
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:32.930
Hmm. Alright, now we see the
children on top of the tower.

f7e8081a-cf44-47a2-8376-4dd4e399d991-0
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:39.151
On the very top of the tower,
it's like a little lighthouse,

f7e8081a-cf44-47a2-8376-4dd4e399d991-1
01:14:39.151 --> 01:14:44.778
and they're looking down at that
rickety bridge, and those guard

f7e8081a-cf44-47a2-8376-4dd4e399d991-2
01:14:44.778 --> 01:14:49.626
soldiers with Spears are now
running after them on this

f7e8081a-cf44-47a2-8376-4dd4e399d991-3
01:14:49.626 --> 01:14:55.167
bridge, which really is missing
a lot of planks, and the purple

f7e8081a-cf44-47a2-8376-4dd4e399d991-4
01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:59.410
bird is flying up above them and
so on the next.

27ae3e73-7bb3-41f5-8dc5-bedae9b7adb0-0
01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:07.736
page they're drawing, and the
boy is drawing big purple. Hmm,

27ae3e73-7bb3-41f5-8dc5-bedae9b7adb0-1
01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:14.430
kind of ellipses And the girl is
drawing something that's long

27ae3e73-7bb3-41f5-8dc5-bedae9b7adb0-2
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:16.130
and rectangular.

65bcd0d0-d9ea-45f1-bab8-e9e279e36a26-0
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:18.110
In red.

3ed022cd-fb52-410d-8c22-453129628841-0
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.800
Whoa.

460b9fe5-642c-4e06-8b53-c255c02e5a0b-0
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:31.729
Ohh OK so now we see what he was
drawing is a huge dragonfly

460b9fe5-642c-4e06-8b53-c255c02e5a0b-1
01:15:31.729 --> 01:15:39.930
purple and those ellipses were
the wings of the dragonfly and

460b9fe5-642c-4e06-8b53-c255c02e5a0b-2
01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:48.132
there are long red ropes that he
is carrying the dragonfly is

460b9fe5-642c-4e06-8b53-c255c02e5a0b-3
01:15:48.132 --> 01:15:50.910
carrying that end up.

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-0
01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:57.251
Holding up a swing that the
children are sitting on, and the

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-1
01:15:57.251 --> 01:16:01.536
red rectangle that she was
drawing is the seat of the

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-2
01:16:01.536 --> 01:16:06.378
swing. And so they're flying
through this through the air on

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-3
01:16:06.378 --> 01:16:11.377
this swing that's attached to
this great purple dragonfly. And

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-4
01:16:11.377 --> 01:16:16.377
they make it just in time to be
out of the reach of the guards

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-5
01:16:16.377 --> 01:16:21.615
that have apparently reached the
top and are now have their hands

18affb24-d14a-43e1-a9eb-cc190f7c7963-6
01:16:21.615 --> 01:16:23.600
out trying to grab their.

47f6cb01-e335-4d2e-bb25-0ff230e5296c-0
01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:28.535
Feet and in the background we
see mountains, but also way far.

47f6cb01-e335-4d2e-bb25-0ff230e5296c-1
01:16:28.535 --> 01:16:33.170
These are snowy mountains, so
we're leaving a desert island

47f6cb01-e335-4d2e-bb25-0ff230e5296c-2
01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:37.650
and heading to snowy mountains
right across the waterway.

26e88887-8de9-43d0-a4b2-b8801f0baba7-0
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:44.575
And in the background are more
blimps coming with more people

26e88887-8de9-43d0-a4b2-b8801f0baba7-1
01:16:44.575 --> 01:16:45.270
in them.

a1aa04b8-0e4c-4291-8ed4-7fe71ce7ada1-0
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:54.188
Ohh alright so now we're on the
snowy mountain and we've landed

a1aa04b8-0e4c-4291-8ed4-7fe71ce7ada1-1
01:16:54.188 --> 01:16:59.936
on the top of a tall. Well it
may not be tall, maybe it's just

a1aa04b8-0e4c-4291-8ed4-7fe71ce7ada1-2
01:16:59.936 --> 01:17:00.940
a pedestal.

a7f9755a-524d-4e1d-bc7e-a0c2a72aaa28-0
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:09.144
Place a pedestal for a Buddha
type statue to be on, and it has

a7f9755a-524d-4e1d-bc7e-a0c2a72aaa28-1
01:17:09.144 --> 01:17:14.564
lanterns hanging around it. It's
up high, but it looks like it's

a7f9755a-524d-4e1d-bc7e-a0c2a72aaa28-2
01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:19.818
on a mountain and it's not tall
itself. So the dragonfly drops

a7f9755a-524d-4e1d-bc7e-a0c2a72aaa28-3
01:17:19.818 --> 01:17:24.906
the children off there and the
blimps are getting closer. So

a7f9755a-524d-4e1d-bc7e-a0c2a72aaa28-4
01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:30.410
the girl in the next page, which
is a drawing, the girl pulls out

a7f9755a-524d-4e1d-bc7e-a0c2a72aaa28-5
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:34.080
her belt and it has many colors
of crayons.

131c855b-ed1e-4c92-9a68-2ad76f650f49-0
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:38.781
And it has actually. It has the
rainbow colors and at which go

131c855b-ed1e-4c92-9a68-2ad76f650f49-1
01:17:38.781 --> 01:17:43.266
along with the map. And so the
bird is getting ready to land

131c855b-ed1e-4c92-9a68-2ad76f650f49-2
01:17:43.266 --> 01:17:48.119
and they are both looking at the
new crayons and deciding what to

131c855b-ed1e-4c92-9a68-2ad76f650f49-3
01:17:48.119 --> 01:17:48.340
do.

2b3b2e08-6296-468e-b2e7-605207d0838e-0
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:58.566
So in the next picture, two of
the blimp flying machines are

2b3b2e08-6296-468e-b2e7-605207d0838e-1
01:17:58.566 --> 01:18:04.987
near them, approaching them. The
one on the left has the guard

2b3b2e08-6296-468e-b2e7-605207d0838e-2
01:18:04.987 --> 01:18:11.102
captain in the gold on it, and
the one on the right has the

2b3b2e08-6296-468e-b2e7-605207d0838e-3
01:18:11.102 --> 01:18:17.522
gold cage. So they're trying to
capture the purple bird again,

2b3b2e08-6296-468e-b2e7-605207d0838e-4
01:18:17.522 --> 01:18:20.579
which is how this all started.

ebf077d7-11d0-4a61-8506-f8f4c8922afa-0
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:25.419
On the right hand side,
{whoops,}  on the right hand

ebf077d7-11d0-4a61-8506-f8f4c8922afa-1
01:18:25.419 --> 01:18:30.093
side, we see another blimp and
coming to help and a couple more

ebf077d7-11d0-4a61-8506-f8f4c8922afa-2
01:18:30.093 --> 01:18:34.401
in the background, but the
action is taking place with the

ebf077d7-11d0-4a61-8506-f8f4c8922afa-3
01:18:34.401 --> 01:18:37.760
two that are by the children on
the pedestal.

b607e4f1-06ee-4ac9-93ee-b24afadfe0a9-0
01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:49.985
Ah, OK, so so wow. These
children now have attached the

b607e4f1-06ee-4ac9-93ee-b24afadfe0a9-1
01:18:49.985 --> 01:18:57.743
belt with the crayons with all
the colors of the rainbow on it

b607e4f1-06ee-4ac9-93ee-b24afadfe0a9-2
01:18:57.743 --> 01:19:05.132
to the purple bird, and the
purple bird is flying away with

b607e4f1-06ee-4ac9-93ee-b24afadfe0a9-3
01:19:05.132 --> 01:19:08.580
the belt of colored crayons.

628d4c77-958b-4369-9273-739ad73c2ad5-0
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.966
And as he flies away, he creates
this big, beautiful rainbow. And

628d4c77-958b-4369-9273-739ad73c2ad5-1
01:19:14.966 --> 01:19:20.835
the captain of the guards is
very upset and it's very bright.

628d4c77-958b-4369-9273-739ad73c2ad5-2
01:19:20.835 --> 01:19:26.230
And all of these people are
falling off of their blimps.

23cccf1d-3a32-41c2-acea-9dc973bf96da-0
01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.623
Maybe it's powerful as well,
maybe it's blasting them. But

23cccf1d-3a32-41c2-acea-9dc973bf96da-1
01:19:31.623 --> 01:19:35.716
the children are not blasted,
they're still standing on the

23cccf1d-3a32-41c2-acea-9dc973bf96da-2
01:19:35.716 --> 01:19:36.330
pedestal.

723dfb7d-4e5a-4e71-b076-d81f661e22fe-0
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.480
Oh, and it's headed. The bird is
headed toward a castle.

3a130b74-a1b2-49ed-9c5e-ce2d94b3b373-0
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.150
Alright, so.

c7d62e79-f94f-4902-ad24-aa20315e7821-0
01:19:54.450 --> 01:20:00.680
The Purple Bird has landed in
this castle area.

8319d21a-8b12-4727-9398-b0eb0aa893f1-0
01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:09.777
And by doing so, he's created a
total rainbow from the pedestal

8319d21a-8b12-4727-9398-b0eb0aa893f1-1
01:20:09.777 --> 01:20:16.956
far in the distance to this
castle city that has waterfalls

8319d21a-8b12-4727-9398-b0eb0aa893f1-2
01:20:16.956 --> 01:20:22.580
and waterways. And it has landed
on this boat.

e3aae31e-6d6e-4881-a1ff-5439e147782c-0
01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:31.778
That has the king on it with
people that look like tourists

e3aae31e-6d6e-4881-a1ff-5439e147782c-1
01:20:31.778 --> 01:20:37.916
that are very happy and the
guards are falling off into the

e3aae31e-6d6e-4881-a1ff-5439e147782c-2
01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:38.529
water.

9e1b907b-7993-4465-9502-8bf1f937f2be-0
01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:48.990
So this might be the end of the
story.

27510eec-8c75-414b-905a-9b205dbcdc48-0
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:55.578
It's a little hard to tell. We
see that the city is being lit

27510eec-8c75-414b-905a-9b205dbcdc48-1
01:20:55.578 --> 01:21:01.471
up by the rainbow. The children
have arrived with the purple

27510eec-8c75-414b-905a-9b205dbcdc48-2
01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:07.266
rhinoceros and the red canopy.
The king is now in a parade,

27510eec-8c75-414b-905a-9b205dbcdc48-3
01:21:07.266 --> 01:21:13.255
riding on a big, huge golden
cart on top. He is on top of the

27510eec-8c75-414b-905a-9b205dbcdc48-4
01:21:13.255 --> 01:21:16.250
purple rhinoceros on this cart.

0135d62b-5e0b-4382-a1d6-a72b836f8f4c-0
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:22.665
Um, which has a boat front, and
the children are right behind

0135d62b-5e0b-4382-a1d6-a72b836f8f4c-1
01:21:22.665 --> 01:21:27.964
him on this purple rhinoceros
and all of his people are around

0135d62b-5e0b-4382-a1d6-a72b836f8f4c-2
01:21:27.964 --> 01:21:32.759
them. Looks like they're
protecting him and cheering him

0135d62b-5e0b-4382-a1d6-a72b836f8f4c-3
01:21:32.759 --> 01:21:34.610
on, and they are on a.

c19da9b6-b484-48b0-a56a-1bdb6fe19afd-0
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:40.358
It's like a boat parade, and so
people are looking from the

c19da9b6-b484-48b0-a56a-1bdb6fe19afd-1
01:21:40.358 --> 01:21:45.481
turrets and the city is turning
rainbow colors and the purple

c19da9b6-b484-48b0-a56a-1bdb6fe19afd-2
01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:50.440
dragonfly is flying high in the
sky and it's a happy scene.

b06dd8dd-812b-4e66-823f-7aa39007a536-0
01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:57.120
So then we see that the.

1eb9e799-49b7-4fa0-bde4-7e471aab981f-0
01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:04.021
Vehicle, boat, kind of vehicle.
With the rhinoceros on, it has

1eb9e799-49b7-4fa0-bde4-7e471aab981f-1
01:22:04.021 --> 01:22:09.711
come to a stopping place where
the king can come down steps and

1eb9e799-49b7-4fa0-bde4-7e471aab981f-2
01:22:09.711 --> 01:22:15.224
he and the children are getting
off the rhinoceros and coming

1eb9e799-49b7-4fa0-bde4-7e471aab981f-3
01:22:15.224 --> 01:22:19.670
down these steps to a rock and
we see the purple.

eae7e078-279d-4a18-bac8-7ccc7911ad36-0
01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:26.194
Dragonfly up in the air, the
rainbow up in the air. Pretty

eae7e078-279d-4a18-bac8-7ccc7911ad36-1
01:22:26.194 --> 01:22:31.978
flowers were around where the
waterfalls coming down on a big

eae7e078-279d-4a18-bac8-7ccc7911ad36-2
01:22:31.978 --> 01:22:37.668
rock on the left hand side and
we see the doorway underneath

eae7e078-279d-4a18-bac8-7ccc7911ad36-3
01:22:37.668 --> 01:22:43.546
the rock, the doorway that the
king had come out of. That's an

eae7e078-279d-4a18-bac8-7ccc7911ad36-4
01:22:43.546 --> 01:22:49.610
interesting shape and we see the
tentacle of the purple octopus.

8ebb5e55-eb32-49d2-afc8-bfc2aaddb478-0
01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.280
Coming out of the water.

c2e07820-d564-48bd-9990-967177800b07-0
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:58.270
So then we see on the right hand
side a series of drawings.

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-0
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.429
And the king is actually drawing
in the first one. The children

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-1
01:23:05.429 --> 01:23:09.161
are standing in front of the
fancy door. They have their

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-2
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:12.827
crayons in their hands. The
Purple bird is on the boy's

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-3
01:23:12.827 --> 01:23:16.362
shoulder. And the king is
drawing now with his orange

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-4
01:23:16.362 --> 01:23:20.421
crayon. And he made crowns for
both of the children, and he's

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-5
01:23:20.421 --> 01:23:24.414
crowning them in the second
picture and the boys down on his

7acbdf1f-bfc7-4699-ab5b-ffe4bb61a138-6
01:23:24.414 --> 01:23:27.230
knee. And then in the third
picture, he's.

c49e9dbe-a388-4ecd-8ce9-5f9aa521445f-0
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:33.286
Letting them go back through the
doorway with their crowns on and

c49e9dbe-a388-4ecd-8ce9-5f9aa521445f-1
01:23:33.286 --> 01:23:34.770
they're saying goodbye.

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:36.650

01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:42.370
And as we.

8fc2efbf-59f7-499d-9921-85bcf00979c3-0
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:47.563
See this what is appears to be
the last picture the children

8fc2efbf-59f7-499d-9921-85bcf00979c3-1
01:23:47.563 --> 01:23:51.983
have come out of that fancy
doorway. They're back under the

8fc2efbf-59f7-499d-9921-85bcf00979c3-2
01:23:51.983 --> 01:23:56.772
Archway Bridge that they were on
before. The Purple bird is with

8fc2efbf-59f7-499d-9921-85bcf00979c3-3
01:23:56.772 --> 01:23:58.540
them and they're facing.

d6a05701-1154-4932-97bf-c137ad073de5-0
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:05.505
#END_quest They're facing a new
the other side of the arched

01:24:05.505 --> 01:24:10.341
bridge, and they see the rainbow
in the sky over a beautiful

d6a05701-1154-4932-97bf-c137ad073de5-2
01:24:10.341 --> 01:24:15.335
city, and everything is green
and pretty there, even though it

d6a05701-1154-4932-97bf-c137ad073de5-3
01:24:15.335 --> 01:24:19.220
was raining on the other side of
the bridge, OK.
