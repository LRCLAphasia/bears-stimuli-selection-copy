{So there are two types of
pictures that you will see in

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:10.353
our norming study. The first
item that you will see is part

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.386
{They are just a series of
pictures that tell a story.

is happening as you go through

so they're not all the same

10 and 15 minutes as you tell

Yeah. And the the words are just

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.860
they don't matter really.}

afdd99b2-fa43-4899-b964-1c1cbdd39dbb-0
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.674
#START_journey OK, it's it's it
looks like a city. There are

afdd99b2-fa43-4899-b964-1c1cbdd39dbb-1
00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:02.170
two, two kids high, five in each
other, ones on a bicycle.

d6407cbf-7fbf-4e00-b2a2-1f4bb30cce30-0
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.144
And then there's a little boy
riding a skateboard or little

d6407cbf-7fbf-4e00-b2a2-1f4bb30cce30-1
00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:11.489
girl riding a skateboard, and
there's a mailbox and there's a

d6407cbf-7fbf-4e00-b2a2-1f4bb30cce30-2
00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:12.260
light post.

b7619e6c-849f-4cf1-9fd7-c9d4f6076215-0
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.174
And the story is for Josephine.
And there's a little boy with a

b7619e6c-849f-4cf1-9fd7-c9d4f6076215-1
00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:20.658
chalk in his hand. Looks like
he's getting ready to write

b7619e6c-849f-4cf1-9fd7-c9d4f6076215-2
00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:22.280
something the building has.

19ac00c0-dfcc-4d6e-b3ff-0374c7e03f29-0
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.970
18 19 20 windows at least on it
with a couple of doors.

f92dd47f-c2d0-4757-bb1e-a0cfa13d2f9f-0
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460
Next to the building, there's a
fire hydrant.

1139d8c5-f4b1-4d9d-ba85-5e400b52d407-0
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.012
Behind that there's a lot of
other buildings got Sky rises,

1139d8c5-f4b1-4d9d-ba85-5e400b52d407-1
00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:45.843
they look like, and then there's
a little girl with the scooter

1139d8c5-f4b1-4d9d-ba85-5e400b52d407-2
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:49.615
and she looks so sad, looks like
no one wants to play with her

1139d8c5-f4b1-4d9d-ba85-5e400b52d407-3
00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:53.147
and she's the boys over there
are having and the girls are

1139d8c5-f4b1-4d9d-ba85-5e400b52d407-4
00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:56.380
having so much fun and she feels
like she's left out.

ac18fd3f-5ba7-4537-a254-05437974ce65-0
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.980
In the next building.

14a2b03f-4c26-4adf-a591-acfdc803b57d-0
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.510
There's a man working at his
desk. He's studying hard, he's

14a2b03f-4c26-4adf-a591-acfdc803b57d-1
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.100
looking at his computer and
working away.

82b69764-9cf7-4c0b-91d8-b492fce247e8-0
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.724
And then there's a little living
room with a staircase and a coat

82b69764-9cf7-4c0b-91d8-b492fce247e8-1
00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:15.803
rack and a mirror and a lamp and
two pictures and little end

82b69764-9cf7-4c0b-91d8-b492fce247e8-2
00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:20.150
table with some books on it and
a plant. And then there's a mom.

82b69764-9cf7-4c0b-91d8-b492fce247e8-3
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.030
She's in the kitchen and looks
like she's cooking dinner.

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-0
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.030
And looks like she might be on
the phone cooking dinner. And

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-1
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.507
there's an oven and some
drawers, 4 drawers and some

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-2
00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:36.639
cooking items on the countertop.
And so she has a little spice

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-3
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.968
rack up there with several items
on there and down below her when

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-4
00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:45.034
no one wants to go, it looks
like it's a water heater and the

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-5
00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:48.969
heater for the whole apartment
building. And then there's a

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-6
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.167
water tunnel which shows where
the water goes and cycles in and

2bff16c6-ae10-41d8-9a64-6463dc2c3e1c-7
00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:53.430
out.

cf6e6bf4-fc90-49f4-83cf-41a85afab261-0
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.686
It's all under the city there,
and that's when, if there's a

cf6e6bf4-fc90-49f4-83cf-41a85afab261-1
00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:01.252
fire, they get the water from
underneath there and there's a

cf6e6bf4-fc90-49f4-83cf-41a85afab261-2
00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:04.877
traffic light up there and it's
on. It's a red right now, and

cf6e6bf4-fc90-49f4-83cf-41a85afab261-3
00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:08.326
there's an arrow pointing to
cross the street, but for the

cf6e6bf4-fc90-49f4-83cf-41a85afab261-4
00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:12.010
opposite direction of course,
because you can't go in the red.

e368759b-329f-4592-a6cc-9aadd0688c36-0
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.920
Up on top of there's a bird in
the sky.

4f891bb7-89d3-485d-9146-7cc590d521cc-0
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.948
Then up on top of one of the
buildings that looks like it

4f891bb7-89d3-485d-9146-7cc590d521cc-1
00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:24.723
might be a some kind of bird
statue up there, and then along

4f891bb7-89d3-485d-9146-7cc590d521cc-2
00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:28.621
the sidewalk down below behind
the fire hydrant, there are two

4f891bb7-89d3-485d-9146-7cc590d521cc-3
00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:29.550
or three trees.

14d48483-b6ae-4b6e-b9d3-bdfb70c38880-0
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.150
And there's clouds in the sky.

999d8b89-3572-4c57-bee0-749abc034fc7-0
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.890
{Alright. And you keep going.
You're good, OK.}

80b8c609-6e8d-4ed0-bf36-fc0416c13106-0
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.687
And in this picture, the moms
cooking dinner, she is on the

80b8c609-6e8d-4ed0-bf36-fc0416c13106-1
00:03:45.687 --> 00:03:49.000
phone. The sad little girl came
in the house with her red

80b8c609-6e8d-4ed0-bf36-fc0416c13106-2
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.314
scooter. Looks like she might
want to help mom get dinner

80b8c609-6e8d-4ed0-bf36-fc0416c13106-3
00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:55.455
ready, but Mom's kind of
ignoring her because she's on

80b8c609-6e8d-4ed0-bf36-fc0416c13106-4
00:03:55.455 --> 00:03:58.883
the phone and then the little
girl goes to her dad and he's

80b8c609-6e8d-4ed0-bf36-fc0416c13106-5
00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:00.540
working away on his computer.

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-0
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.494
She's trying to get his
attention, wants to go fly a

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-1
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:08.461
kite, but she can't because he's
studying away and ignoring her.

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-2
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:12.428
And then she goes, I guess it's
her sister on a couch, but she's

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-3
00:04:12.428 --> 00:04:16.333
playing video games. She wants
her to play with her, but nobody

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-4
00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:20.117
wants to play with her. It's
kind of sad that she goes to her

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-5
00:04:20.117 --> 00:04:24.084
room and she's in her bed, very
sad. And her bed is sailboats on

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-6
00:04:24.084 --> 00:04:27.807
it, and she has a map on her
desk and she has a Kitty on the

5fdffbe6-44cb-474c-aee3-c6dc0cc8fd0b-7
00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:31.530
floor and her papers are on the
floor and the trash can and.

2247821f-1cdb-4df8-a20d-42cdb2c4d777-0
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.043
Dresser girl with four drawers
in it and a picture on her wall.

2247821f-1cdb-4df8-a20d-42cdb2c4d777-1
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:37.200
She was very sad.

5b8987ee-cbce-452e-b573-5166a05e7d96-0
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.113
She's still in her room even the
cat leaves the room. Probably

5b8987ee-cbce-452e-b573-5166a05e7d96-1
00:04:44.113 --> 00:04:45.250
makes her even sadder.

d8b2b146-dae8-438c-a60c-23304f75824f-0
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.557
Then uh, more papers are on the
floor. Actually, might have been

d8b2b146-dae8-438c-a60c-23304f75824f-1
00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:51.060
coloring.

f6e71c76-614b-471c-8377-d63e94284a39-0
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.230
Then she up there is coloring,
writing letters, and then she

f6e71c76-614b-471c-8377-d63e94284a39-1
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.548
looks like she's drawing a
magical draw on her wall. And

f6e71c76-614b-471c-8377-d63e94284a39-2
00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:04.200
then she goes to the magical
door.

bd1559e3-b7a3-4a71-8c0b-429d2fbe7f76-0
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.525
What's on the other side? It's a
magical red. It's a red door. It

bd1559e3-b7a3-4a71-8c0b-429d2fbe7f76-1
00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:12.696
takes her into a beautiful
forest with lights hanging

bd1559e3-b7a3-4a71-8c0b-429d2fbe7f76-2
00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:16.220
everywhere and lamps hanging
everywhere. It's so beautiful.

4d0e4945-a153-4759-93bb-c7b7bc492dc3-0
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.910
The river running through it.

36028d75-4de7-4d20-a24a-a6b02910bc65-0
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.679
Then there's a little kind of
like a pier that she goes into

36028d75-4de7-4d20-a24a-a6b02910bc65-1
00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:30.152
the end of the pier on the river
and looks in the river and she

36028d75-4de7-4d20-a24a-a6b02910bc65-2
00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:32.160
can see her reflection in the
river.

ce918a4a-1bc5-477c-af33-76ac6fadd493-0
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.933
And then she leans over the
Little Pierre and draws. She

ce918a4a-1bc5-477c-af33-76ac6fadd493-1
00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:40.799
draws a boat and you there must
be a magical boat. And she gets

ce918a4a-1bc5-477c-af33-76ac6fadd493-2
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.369
in the boat and takes off.

15264e26-ff53-404f-a020-e1150c425030-0
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.050
The boat is taking her to looks
like a giant castle just coming

15264e26-ff53-404f-a020-e1150c425030-1
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.991
up to the bridge and the castle.
The castle is just massive and

15264e26-ff53-404f-a020-e1150c425030-2
00:05:55.991 --> 00:06:01.009
it has a Moat around it. So many
doors, so many windows, so many

15264e26-ff53-404f-a020-e1150c425030-3
00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.480
towers, and it's just beautiful.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.181
Ohh. She gave him a ride the
boat into the castle and the

7a78c9cc-970c-4cad-b88d-cafd857448b0-1
00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:15.600
guards are telling her stop I
think and they're all, they're

7a78c9cc-970c-4cad-b88d-cafd857448b0-2
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.403
saluting her. They could be
waving, they could be

7a78c9cc-970c-4cad-b88d-cafd857448b0-3
00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:21.934
countertop. I think they might
be waving to her and the one of

7a78c9cc-970c-4cad-b88d-cafd857448b0-4
00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:25.129
them saluting her. And then
there's another boy and girl

7a78c9cc-970c-4cad-b88d-cafd857448b0-5
00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.660
down on another boat down below
and a couple more on the other

7a78c9cc-970c-4cad-b88d-cafd857448b0-6
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.800
side over there paddling through
this wonderful castle.

1d32d267-790a-4594-bdbd-8292d7635cf4-0
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.009
And then she gets to the oh a
waterfall. Well, that'd be kind

1d32d267-790a-4594-bdbd-8292d7635cf4-1
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.235
of scary. I mean all of a sudden
you're boat comes little

1d32d267-790a-4594-bdbd-8292d7635cf4-2
00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:47.573
waterfall down below. People are
watching her come down the

1d32d267-790a-4594-bdbd-8292d7635cf4-3
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.130
waterfall.

139ffcfd-d50f-4638-a14c-b0826ffd6869-0
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.301
On their boats and all of a
sudden she draws, she draws, she

139ffcfd-d50f-4638-a14c-b0826ffd6869-1
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.952
draws a string to catch herself.
Looks like a jump rope that

139ffcfd-d50f-4638-a14c-b0826ffd6869-2
00:06:56.952 --> 00:06:57.910
might catch her.

2c1e7e0d-8288-4be4-afd4-8b36680799e5-0
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.009
 catch her, but hopefully it
does. Oh, she drew a hot air

2c1e7e0d-8288-4be4-afd4-8b36680799e5-1
00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.701
balloon. That's what she was
drawing. And now she's waving

2c1e7e0d-8288-4be4-afd4-8b36680799e5-2
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:10.519
goodbye to the people at the
castle and she's flying away to

2c1e7e0d-8288-4be4-afd4-8b36680799e5-3
00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:14.211
somewhere else to this, and
there's a strange thing in the

2c1e7e0d-8288-4be4-afd4-8b36680799e5-4
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:15.150
sky over there.

b5a95dd3-0741-4386-bf6e-32465dbbf945-0
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.328
And other people will then looks
like a balloon type of machine

b5a95dd3-0741-4386-bf6e-32465dbbf945-1
00:07:19.328 --> 00:07:22.490
up there and a bird flying. So
they're up in the clouds very

b5a95dd3-0741-4386-bf6e-32465dbbf945-2
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.750
high.

670c18fb-a72a-4c79-bf50-918b6e9c7285-0
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.488
She's looking over and she sees,
she sees the people in the other

670c18fb-a72a-4c79-bf50-918b6e9c7285-1
00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:33.716
boat and there's more than one
boat. There's a couple of

670c18fb-a72a-4c79-bf50-918b6e9c7285-2
00:07:33.716 --> 00:07:37.114
balloon boats, and these people
look like they're trying to

670c18fb-a72a-4c79-bf50-918b6e9c7285-3
00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:40.626
catch the bird, but the bird
escaped from their cage. I see a

670c18fb-a72a-4c79-bf50-918b6e9c7285-4
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:44.364
little bird cage in there, and a
bird must have escaped. So one's

670c18fb-a72a-4c79-bf50-918b6e9c7285-5
00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.310
holding on to the other, trying
to catch that bird.

8a6bcc73-4c62-44c4-b36f-8365753ee3a5-0
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.270
Just see what happens.

4ec7cfdf-b2c9-4488-b9f9-bd49682fa729-0
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.500
And she flies over to this
strange contraption in the sky.

117a4ce3-2712-4922-b6e8-47b1c3cb45f9-0
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.420
Looks like there's a bird in a
cage up there.

5b34aa19-fc8e-4dfc-9bf5-3233b64d8266-0
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.960
she is flying over to it.

ee027daa-9ece-4f2d-b8de-275c8062f8c7-0
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.508
Not sure what this contraption
is, but it flies in the air and

ee027daa-9ece-4f2d-b8de-275c8062f8c7-1
00:08:09.508 --> 00:08:11.390
there's that bird statue on top
of it.

8207a130-2710-406e-a6d6-21af72c21483-0
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.350
The balloon guys are in the
boat, floating around it.

b478b5ea-8992-4856-bf23-dc2de6e92e19-0
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.098
And she gets off. Her balloon is
running, running towards the

b478b5ea-8992-4856-bf23-dc2de6e92e19-1
00:08:25.098 --> 00:08:27.590
door. And the machine. The crazy
machine.

f507fe10-5e41-435e-b034-6352377626c7-0
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.030
up above the two guys are
guarding a bird.

d9854619-a86f-41c4-8a3b-b84515930dd3-0
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.723
And then she used climbing a
ladder up to the bird. She

d9854619-a86f-41c4-8a3b-b84515930dd3-1
00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:39.259
climbed it all the way up, and
there are the two guards. They

d9854619-a86f-41c4-8a3b-b84515930dd3-2
00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:42.567
can't see her because their
backs are to them. That's the

d9854619-a86f-41c4-8a3b-b84515930dd3-3
00:08:42.567 --> 00:08:46.160
same tower that that was not a
bird was a dragon on top of it.

4ee41842-ad69-47ad-b9b3-e92173f5c52c-0
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.210
She runs and she gets the bird
and she's running away with it.

c2c3498f-67cb-46ef-a1b8-c9af200d88c6-0
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.938
she is stealing the bird and
running and running and running

c2c3498f-67cb-46ef-a1b8-c9af200d88c6-1
00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:03.921
and all the guards are chasing
her. Then she let the bird go.

c2c3498f-67cb-46ef-a1b8-c9af200d88c6-2
00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:05.270
Yay. The bird is free

86461dee-dc85-4789-9d25-fdddc1972692-0
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.017
Ohh and then they capture though
ohh they catch her. What is she

86461dee-dc85-4789-9d25-fdddc1972692-1
00:09:13.017 --> 00:09:17.574
going to do? In the bird cage is
empty and the main guards there

86461dee-dc85-4789-9d25-fdddc1972692-2
00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:20.940
pointing off to where the bird
went now. Oh no.

7bccaab9-5c47-43bd-927d-1de2f505a55f-0
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.621
What happened? They put her in
the cage instead of the bird.

7bccaab9-5c47-43bd-927d-1de2f505a55f-1
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.400
Now she's stuck in the cage all
by herself.

437a278b-2fed-44ae-98ba-c1359dc8b0e7-0
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.983
Then the bird comes with her
crayon. Yay now she can do magic

437a278b-2fed-44ae-98ba-c1359dc8b0e7-1
00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:41.219
again. Bird comes to save her.
So she's drawing another picture

437a278b-2fed-44ae-98ba-c1359dc8b0e7-2
00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:45.522
with a bird on her shoulder and
the bird and her happy. Together

437a278b-2fed-44ae-98ba-c1359dc8b0e7-3
00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:49.030
they look and he's the birds
watching her draw away.

2541752f-3b23-421a-9df6-3914838efd39-0
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.664
Ohh, she drew a magic carpet.
She's flying away in a magic

2541752f-3b23-421a-9df6-3914838efd39-1
00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:59.849
carpet after the bird. The
bird's leading her and she's

2541752f-3b23-421a-9df6-3914838efd39-2
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:03.090
following the bird so she
finally got away from the cage

2541752f-3b23-421a-9df6-3914838efd39-3
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.999
they put her in.

9abc0ab2-49f2-416b-a420-d964c09e1210-0
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.579
And she's flying. All the stars
are out at night. It's so

9abc0ab2-49f2-416b-a420-d964c09e1210-1
00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:18.775
beautiful. And she's still
following the bird. It looks

9abc0ab2-49f2-416b-a420-d964c09e1210-2
00:10:18.775 --> 00:10:22.027
like they might be going to
another castle, or maybe the

9abc0ab2-49f2-416b-a420-d964c09e1210-3
00:10:22.027 --> 00:10:25.793
same castle in a beautiful looks
like it might even be an island.

9abc0ab2-49f2-416b-a420-d964c09e1210-4
00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:27.619
I don't know. We'll have to see.

93c82ca3-65b6-470e-be00-6ba85af1908c-0
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.680
Ohh there's a little pond tree
that the birds taking her to and

93c82ca3-65b6-470e-be00-6ba85af1908c-1
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.600
it has a door in it.

25358199-4f59-422e-9d93-0577f9b9b435-0
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.240
So she's going over to the door
with the birdie showing her.

4c3aa574-30b7-43b7-917c-103822b8881e-0
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.605
And she opens the door, and the
bird flies through, and then she

4c3aa574-30b7-43b7-917c-103822b8881e-1
00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:46.130
follows the bird. And who knows
where this door goes to, though?

ec854f0e-b5ec-4e67-a787-925d14b749ce-0
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.380
 it takes her.

eebc95d0-f18c-486d-89bf-41b5e836fce5-0
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.520
Looks like it's back to her
town, and there's a little boy

eebc95d0-f18c-486d-89bf-41b5e836fce5-1
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.130
with a purple crayon that he's
been coloring. It looks like

eebc95d0-f18c-486d-89bf-41b5e836fce5-2
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.560
it's his bird, and that looks
like she's found a friend.

ab73249a-0654-427d-811c-7460280537be-0
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.689
Boy and her in the bird, and now
she's drawing something, a

ab73249a-0654-427d-811c-7460280537be-1
00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:11.210
circle. And the boy is watching
her and he draws a circle.

7a202081-4204-4d3d-8009-1651cb7e48b0-0
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.547
#END_journey Ohh, they made a
bicycle and the two of them are

7a202081-4204-4d3d-8009-1651cb7e48b0-1
00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:19.507
riding off together and she's
happy now and the bird is

7a202081-4204-4d3d-8009-1651cb7e48b0-2
00:11:19.507 --> 00:11:20.300
following them.

45ef1d98-643c-49bb-b40b-18e75b35e47f-0
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.905
{OK, great. So that was the
story you talk about 10 minutes,

45ef1d98-643c-49bb-b40b-18e75b35e47f-1
00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:27.530
which is what we're aiming for.
That was good.}

209064c5-14c5-411d-9db5-8ae4d21851ef-0
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.976
{OK, so next is something
different. It will be a complex

209064c5-14c5-411d-9db5-8ae4d21851ef-1
00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:33.500
scene.}

f4a33524-c954-475b-a24b-3b4d4ac47ee9-0
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.459
{Again, describe what you see
and what is happening as

f4a33524-c954-475b-a24b-3b4d4ac47ee9-1
00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:43.610
thoroughly as possible, but take
between three and five minutes.}

c82e586b-6d9f-42fc-bed3-bd8e4776a43c-0
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.750
{I know that's the part that
everyone's like, wow.}

593c6b1f-f622-4e6e-ad19-0781b6e9c27b-0
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.562
#START_exhibit-12 This is a very
very busy, busy, busy, busy

593c6b1f-f622-4e6e-ad19-0781b6e9c27b-1
00:11:59.562 --> 00:12:01.990
place with many, many many many
people.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.334
The Great Portrait exhibition.
So there's people, ladders,

39a66c45-026f-45e3-9708-cab249433445-1
00:12:07.334 --> 00:12:11.340
drawing things. There's people
hanging above drawing things.

giant

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.977
Portraits are everywhere.
There's portraits of Cowboys is

a18fcef6-72b0-401d-a6cb-14b9a5a0f382-1
00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:22.721
portraits of older men and

drawing on the floor because

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:24.230

hang pictures on the wall.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.830
Pictures of horses and people

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.000

This is just amazing. So many
people.

I'd like this place. It's too

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.173
I see a nice fishing off of one
of the railings. I don't know

95a9ca61-0a51-490b-8746-3a467e890a6f-1
00:14:12.173 --> 00:14:15.017
why he's fishing out there.
Maybe he's trying to catch a

95a9ca61-0a51-490b-8746-3a467e890a6f-2
00:14:15.017 --> 00:14:17.960
picture. Maybe he's trying to
hang his picture from below.

95a9ca61-0a51-490b-8746-3a467e890a6f-3
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.954
Maybe. Maybe that's why. And
then one guy is trying to hang

95a9ca61-0a51-490b-8746-3a467e890a6f-4
00:14:20.954 --> 00:14:23.050
his picture, but he's got it
upside down.

silly.

his boxing mitts on. He's ready
for a fight. He must really want

b85136ea-10ea-4596-a723-e87ceae8ba82-2
00:14:38.818 --> 00:14:42.231
his picture hung. And there's a
lady there drawing a picture as

00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:45.217
they speak through that crazy
crowd. She's just they're

00:15:24.494 --> 00:15:27.640
station. There's a bar, there's
a bait shop.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.200
Little man walking across. It
looks like a little dog going

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.620
with him and has four light
posts, 2 on each side of the

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.400
bridge. I don't know if that's
his car, but there's a car that

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.500
ran off. The ravine is in a
ditch.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.047
Could be water even down there,
because I see an anchor and I

3a13189f-a7a6-4b43-a143-bc079d130ec8-1
00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:55.041
see a boat where there used to
be water at least. And then

3a13189f-a7a6-4b43-a143-bc079d130ec8-2
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:59.239
there's a a broken little pier
there that once was probably a

00:15:59.239 --> 00:16:03.165
nice pier, but it's broken now.
In front of the bait shop

3a13189f-a7a6-4b43-a143-bc079d130ec8-4
00:16:03.165 --> 00:16:04.520
there's a old truck.

f719bdcd-abf4-4519-8173-ef5937780e48-0
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.870
where  we could deliver the fish
and bait to people. There's a

f719bdcd-abf4-4519-8173-ef5937780e48-1
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.310
little little guy walking down
the street, walking towards the

f719bdcd-abf4-4519-8173-ef5937780e48-2
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.440
bait shops, probably going to
the bar.

house for the night.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.680
And up above that, there's
another person in the window and

01c941b2-98c4-4b5a-9648-61fd7ba7eea5-1
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.104
smokes coming out of the stack
of the chimney, and clothes are

01c941b2-98c4-4b5a-9648-61fd7ba7eea5-2
00:16:30.104 --> 00:16:33.311
hanging on the clothesline
between their house and another

01c941b2-98c4-4b5a-9648-61fd7ba7eea5-3
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:36.300
house. And there's another
person in that house by the

01c941b2-98c4-4b5a-9648-61fd7ba7eea5-4
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.778
truck. There's stairs that lead
all the way up to one door, and

01c941b2-98c4-4b5a-9648-61fd7ba7eea5-5
00:16:39.778 --> 00:16:42.550
then it leads you all the way up
to a second door.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.380
Up there, there's a cat in the
window watching everything.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.600
In the bar, there's a typical
barcel. {OK, go ahead.}

1acc3bd4-2623-4348-adfd-2f0541cc68d1-0
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.082
There's that little man that was
crossing the bridge with his

1acc3bd4-2623-4348-adfd-2f0541cc68d1-1
00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:03.680
little dog, walking into town
now.

ff827f6a-1793-400c-9f9d-fb043db95841-0
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.271
Can't quite make the name of
that store out. There's a store

ff827f6a-1793-400c-9f9d-fb043db95841-1
00:17:09.271 --> 00:17:09.570
there.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.220
Just walk by with the clock on
top of it.

7c894b23-f1e7-4cee-9163-38997c485382-0
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.646
People are looking out the
window and there's more. There's

7c894b23-f1e7-4cee-9163-38997c485382-1
00:17:17.646 --> 00:17:21.065
some curtains hanging in the
window over there and there's

7c894b23-f1e7-4cee-9163-38997c485382-2
00:17:21.065 --> 00:17:24.426
other people in the corner
there. It's like a man yelling

7c894b23-f1e7-4cee-9163-38997c485382-3
00:17:24.426 --> 00:17:24.600
at.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.250
I don't know if that's his wife
or his friend.

c727f82d-a3b3-4498-a3df-5a42d7435a73-0
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.378
Then there's a statue of a horse
with a guy riding it, and

c727f82d-a3b3-4498-a3df-5a42d7435a73-1
00:17:33.378 --> 00:17:37.401
there's another man sitting on
his balcony with his cat and he

c727f82d-a3b3-4498-a3df-5a42d7435a73-2
00:17:37.401 --> 00:17:38.360
looks very sad.

99574b72-2261-4022-8a1a-cb0d3e89eccd-0
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.815
another guy out in front of the
cafe, just hanging out above the

99574b72-2261-4022-8a1a-cb0d3e89eccd-1
00:17:43.815 --> 00:17:47.250
cafe. It looks like there's a
bunch of people in there.

12d49696-e6ce-4130-86e5-212829fa8bbd-0
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.310
Maybe they're all eating up
there. That's their house, one

12d49696-e6ce-4130-86e5-212829fa8bbd-1
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.020
or the other.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.395
And then there's several people
and several different windows.

fabb17fe-ee3e-4531-9df6-09dff6312214-1
00:17:57.395 --> 00:18:00.381
All we know there's a person on
a motorcycle riding through

fabb17fe-ee3e-4531-9df6-09dff6312214-2
00:18:00.381 --> 00:18:02.920
town. The little boy looks like
he's walking home.

d3951e20-b9de-48cb-b331-fdffa1e09001-0
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.090
OK.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.375
Ohh, the little old man is still
in the picture. He's the only

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-1
00:18:14.375 --> 00:18:17.683
one in color, by the way. The
whole picture is black and

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-2
00:18:17.683 --> 00:18:21.222
white. He's in color and he sees
a little house and it's for

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-3
00:18:21.222 --> 00:18:24.820
sale. Maybe he's interested in
it. It's like it's kind of run

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-4
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.069
down, but maybe it'll be nice
for him. Now we're on the

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-5
00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:31.203
corner. There's a half a
Coca-Cola sign, a little man

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-6
00:18:31.203 --> 00:18:34.626
sitting out there and a clock
and people up in their house

384ad58b-14f8-4f61-b9d6-12f9401cc93c-7
00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:37.470
with a cat in the window and
looks like they're.

4401708a-aac0-4b13-9b36-e7861a02a2de-0
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.471
Just getting around, getting
ready for dinner and above them

4401708a-aac0-4b13-9b36-e7861a02a2de-1
00:18:41.471 --> 00:18:45.294
is an older man, not looks like
he's reading a book across the

4401708a-aac0-4b13-9b36-e7861a02a2de-2
00:18:45.294 --> 00:18:48.935
way. There are a couple of
people. There's a little boy way

4401708a-aac0-4b13-9b36-e7861a02a2de-3
00:18:48.935 --> 00:18:49.360
up top.

527210e5-75aa-46a0-8723-99ca1069beb4-0
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.711
Looks like almost like an attic
And he's got the door door

527210e5-75aa-46a0-8723-99ca1069beb4-1
00:18:53.711 --> 00:18:57.103
windows open and sitting there.
And then we come over to the

527210e5-75aa-46a0-8723-99ca1069beb4-2
00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:00.607
other house. A lot of people,
it's like a little baby in there

527210e5-75aa-46a0-8723-99ca1069beb4-3
00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:03.888
and mom. And then there's
another man who's by himself. He

527210e5-75aa-46a0-8723-99ca1069beb4-4
00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:07.392
looks like he's hot and he's got
the fan on and doesn't have a

527210e5-75aa-46a0-8723-99ca1069beb4-5
00:19:07.392 --> 00:19:08.950
shirt on, so he must be hot.

404d9dfa-eef0-4a21-a476-52150ebb3ea4-0
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.090
Then down below him, as a mom
looks like she's yelling at her

404d9dfa-eef0-4a21-a476-52150ebb3ea4-1
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.910
little boy, you must have did
something.

9712f557-3729-43f1-b914-27cc77f50254-0
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.420
Gonna go over and.

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-0
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.094
Looks like a lady walking into a
shop, and up above that looks

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-1
00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:27.321
like an artist getting painting,
painting, a picture. Another got

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-2
00:19:27.321 --> 00:19:31.228
another window, another little
girl up there, another little

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-3
00:19:31.228 --> 00:19:35.007
family. Then there's two two men
standing just hanging out

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-4
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.978
talking to each other. Another
little kid talking to an older

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-5
00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:42.692
man, and then a little boy by
the fountain sitting by. It

f7569f4e-7e1d-4a28-a968-182dccb51ff0-6
00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:44.549
looks like his dad with them.

f7d361f4-0c9d-48f0-9d89-be6df9938927-0
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.820
OK.

63ac7193-43b1-45a1-94d2-8e9f2ff7a5b1-0
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.939
Ohh. All of a sudden the man
bought the house and the house

63ac7193-43b1-45a1-94d2-8e9f2ff7a5b1-1
00:19:54.939 --> 00:19:58.751
turned the color and it was
beautiful. Beautiful. It's got a

63ac7193-43b1-45a1-94d2-8e9f2ff7a5b1-2
00:19:58.751 --> 00:20:02.563
lawn mower out front so he's cut
the grass, he's painted the

63ac7193-43b1-45a1-94d2-8e9f2ff7a5b1-3
00:20:02.563 --> 00:20:06.500
house, put new blue shutters on
it. Purple roof. It just looks

63ac7193-43b1-45a1-94d2-8e9f2ff7a5b1-4
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500
so pretty. Little girls watching
him work away.

0044508d-db92-4697-9e50-cfe397b31086-0
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.841
Probably admiring the work he
has done, because everything

0044508d-db92-4697-9e50-cfe397b31086-1
00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:19.048
else is just in black and white.
The man in the scooter and a man

0044508d-db92-4697-9e50-cfe397b31086-2
00:20:19.048 --> 00:20:23.065
in a wheelchair with a broken
leg going down the Cobble Street

0044508d-db92-4697-9e50-cfe397b31086-3
00:20:23.065 --> 00:20:26.762
Road. A little girl and her
mother and a little boy and a

0044508d-db92-4697-9e50-cfe397b31086-4
00:20:26.762 --> 00:20:30.778
businessman walking, the little
man still sitting out front of

0044508d-db92-4697-9e50-cfe397b31086-5
00:20:30.778 --> 00:20:34.540
the Coca-Cola sign. The lady
waiting in front of the door.

41391079-6d68-4672-81e5-61058b1f75de-0
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.142
Woman up there just watching
everybody, I think, and the

41391079-6d68-4672-81e5-61058b1f75de-1
00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:42.881
beautiful tree came to color.
Must be in his yard, because

41391079-6d68-4672-81e5-61058b1f75de-2
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:45.290
everything in his house is
beautiful.

25a88fcd-16ba-43cc-b486-4faa831e8784-0
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.280
Everybody's in their house just
doing the same thing.

9deea0d2-c78c-4c7b-ab02-719bcd5f5680-0
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.374
Oh, and then the little girl
that's watched him is now turned

9deea0d2-c78c-4c7b-ab02-719bcd5f5680-1
00:20:58.374 --> 00:20:58.880
to color.

67b06e8e-2e4f-4d0b-bf0f-180c4c635e14-0
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.655
Probably because the woman must
have talked to her, gave ohh he

67b06e8e-2e4f-4d0b-bf0f-180c4c635e14-1
00:21:03.655 --> 00:21:06.767
gave her a flower, so she turned
to color. Everybody else is

67b06e8e-2e4f-4d0b-bf0f-180c4c635e14-2
00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:07.890
still black and white.

a11e0504-7623-4300-982f-a967b2c276c0-0
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.282
They're running, but they're
holding on to a little girl.

a11e0504-7623-4300-982f-a967b2c276c0-1
00:21:12.282 --> 00:21:15.282
People are still in their homes.
The painter is sitting on the

a11e0504-7623-4300-982f-a967b2c276c0-2
00:21:15.282 --> 00:21:18.330
edge now. I don't think he could
think of what he should paint.

2a5d3868-17ec-4712-affb-191f42c71fa2-0
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.920
The delivery guy is there at his
door.

79d61cc6-55cc-4235-9431-8c3e73a9907f-0
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.585
The boy still by the fountain
and the man pushing selling

79d61cc6-55cc-4235-9431-8c3e73a9907f-1
00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.160
something.

db4c4fad-1ec8-4db8-bdaf-239568a2617c-0
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.440
Ohh, and now there's more people
with color talent. One side is

db4c4fad-1ec8-4db8-bdaf-239568a2617c-1
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.910
starting to color up.

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-0
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.122
Happiness to this town give
another person a flower and they

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-1
00:21:46.122 --> 00:21:49.741
turned the color and the boy
next to him is still but in

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-2
00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:53.868
black and white. And the little
girls in color and little boy in

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-3
00:21:53.868 --> 00:21:57.804
color another little girl in
color the gentleman by the light

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-4
00:21:57.804 --> 00:22:01.804
post in color little girl and
her grandpa in color the sign by

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-5
00:22:01.804 --> 00:22:05.740
the Coca-Cola guys in color now.
And the woman upstairs is in

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-6
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.803
color and the old man's in color
and then went up in the way up

1d1b5bd4-5872-4650-b5d9-a4b196ac8311-7
00:22:09.803 --> 00:22:12.280
high he's in color. And the
other two.

b084163c-0c81-43af-bd77-598453ecd44a-0
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.694
Those are in color. We still
have some more black and white

b084163c-0c81-43af-bd77-598453ecd44a-1
00:22:15.694 --> 00:22:19.251
on the other side and they look
sad, except the man is taking a

b084163c-0c81-43af-bd77-598453ecd44a-2
00:22:19.251 --> 00:22:22.474
bath. That's what he's doing
with the fan on, and he's in

b084163c-0c81-43af-bd77-598453ecd44a-3
00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:23.030
color now.

bb78d888-b412-4bc5-b88b-fba7d65f77d6-0
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.440
below in color.

a606fae0-709d-43f1-9241-cefdfe229f56-0
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.668
The movers and shakers are looks
like they're moving out, moving

a606fae0-709d-43f1-9241-cefdfe229f56-1
00:22:29.668 --> 00:22:32.795
on. I don't know where they're
going. The little boy by the

a606fae0-709d-43f1-9241-cefdfe229f56-2
00:22:32.795 --> 00:22:35.350
fountains in color and the
artist has color now.

aec83c74-760e-471f-94a2-f81bed25801d-0
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.280
Right now, because he has a
flower.

898561fa-24a1-47a1-8c20-cc16b03e2d59-0
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.746
And a little delivery man. And
they're man. They're all coming

898561fa-24a1-47a1-8c20-cc16b03e2d59-1
00:22:43.746 --> 00:22:47.020
to color. The town is slowly
coming alive again. So

898561fa-24a1-47a1-8c20-cc16b03e2d59-2
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.650
beautiful.

15163292-58d6-48c8-8116-098b750ed493-0
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:57.005
And he's colored the whole town
now. The milkman structures all

15163292-58d6-48c8-8116-098b750ed493-1
00:22:57.005 --> 00:22:59.860
colored up. All the people are
in color.

52400d4f-e085-49a6-91a1-fb4d9d5457a5-0
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.893
New people are there. The guy in
the bathtub still happens,

52400d4f-e085-49a6-91a1-fb4d9d5457a5-1
00:23:04.893 --> 00:23:07.080
taking a long bath, and he's
happy.

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-0
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.020
up above the families up there,
and they're so happy in color

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-1
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.408
and the artist actually can
paint a picture. Now that he's

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-2
00:23:15.408 --> 00:23:19.141
happy, he knows what the paint.
And the mother's there all happy

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-3
00:23:19.141 --> 00:23:22.816
in her car. Driving through the
town, the little boy got in the

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-4
00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:26.204
fountain because he's so happy.
Little clown over there is

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-5
00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:29.764
entertaining the little girl,
and the little boys are hugging

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-6
00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:33.153
them. Looks like maybe their
dad. It's just a happy, happy

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-7
00:23:33.153 --> 00:23:36.943
place. And everything is turned,
all the cobblestones even turned

a67fa90d-0c4b-42b0-9701-a48fc10d196e-8
00:23:36.943 --> 00:23:37.459
to color.

24ce2126-6288-452f-a915-2513a7ecf2d3-0
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.230
Beautiful day.

c23a0d47-da11-41b6-b43e-5cbc371e614a-0
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.695
And this, the man that was
taking a bath is now on the

c23a0d47-da11-41b6-b43e-5cbc371e614a-1
00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:53.120
roof, but he's got a towel on,
so that's a good thing.

984a15f3-dcb0-4be3-a3cf-237a7e398f29-0
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.447

looking at the beautiful town.

984a15f3-dcb0-4be3-a3cf-237a7e398f29-2
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:05.639

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.470

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.670
There's a guy by the store there
and another man.

dfc37285-35d7-45a5-9a22-1b04dbd8121f-0
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.973
And then the guy on the
motorcycle is in town handing

dfc37285-35d7-45a5-9a22-1b04dbd8121f-1
00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:20.932

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.347
balcony with flowers. They're
all happy to see a couple up

dfc37285-35d7-45a5-9a22-1b04dbd8121f-4

Cobblestone street is so

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.140
colors.

446c077d-edf5-4840-b837-b9cbb820758d-0
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:41.145
Yeah, everything is in color and
everybody's in their house now.

446c077d-edf5-4840-b837-b9cbb820758d-1
00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:45.017
Looks like it's been night time,
so they're all going home and

446c077d-edf5-4840-b837-b9cbb820758d-2
00:25:45.017 --> 00:25:45.940

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.890
And then everything's in black
and white again.

1fa529ee-2f54-4808-b0be-8ca6ff23ffed-0
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.980
Looks like he sold this house.

4696e00d-e71b-478a-b2a7-fbc0bb2d193c-0
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.645
Everything turned black and
white and now everybody looks

4696e00d-e71b-478a-b2a7-fbc0bb2d193c-1
00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:03.210
sad again.

ed2b90ca-cb06-421b-8d04-3186820e8c8e-0
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.620
Don't know why he left and took
his magic with him. His little

ed2b90ca-cb06-421b-8d04-3186820e8c8e-1
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.101
dog and him are the only two
things left in color and

ed2b90ca-cb06-421b-8d04-3186820e8c8e-2
00:26:12.101 --> 00:26:14.099
everyone shocked to see him go.

dd81c991-a686-4c50-9615-ee414f8370d7-0
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.921
#END_flowerman Ohh that they
have a flower still so they

dd81c991-a686-4c50-9615-ee414f8370d7-1
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:25.251
guess they can have still have
color even though the old man

dd81c991-a686-4c50-9615-ee414f8370d7-2
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:28.690
left because he gave the little
girl flower and the man in the

dd81c991-a686-4c50-9615-ee414f8370d7-3
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.966
window a flower. So I think the
color is going to come back

dd81c991-a686-4c50-9615-ee414f8370d7-4
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:35.077
again. He left them the magic
flowers it gives the house

dd81c991-a686-4c50-9615-ee414f8370d7-5
00:26:35.077 --> 00:26:35.459
colors.

story.}

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.510
{And then switching it up, we're
moving on to a complex scene.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.470
Buckle up.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.990
Through the five minutes.}

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.588
#START_campsite Ohh Waldo in
France. Wake up Waldo. Friends,

b414ad66-1d2f-4415-8353-93d697cd7697-1
00:26:59.588 --> 00:27:03.873
have you ever seen mermaids in a
candle in a canal? Or flowers

b414ad66-1d2f-4415-8353-93d697cd7697-2
00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:08.158
painted over a tent or liner?
Hikers winding along the country

b414ad66-1d2f-4415-8353-93d697cd7697-3
00:27:08.158 --> 00:27:12.579
lanes? I have today was amazing.
Must be one of those fine Waldo

b414ad66-1d2f-4415-8353-93d697cd7697-4
00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:15.299
Pictures, but there's so much
going on.

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-0
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.567
At the top there are trailers,
many trailers with lots of

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-1
00:27:21.567 --> 00:27:25.701
people visiting each other and
talking to each other and just

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-2
00:27:25.701 --> 00:27:30.102
hanging out, having fun. There's
dogs as people up above, there's

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-3
00:27:30.102 --> 00:27:34.370
people running and jogging, and
there's kids riding their bikes

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-4
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.438
and there's a road coming down,
Girl Scouts, and they're out

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-5
00:27:38.438 --> 00:27:42.372
there having some kind of a
event that they're practicing.

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-6
00:27:42.372 --> 00:27:46.239
No boys on the side and men are
fishing, they're catching

503f2b99-839e-435a-a01f-28894940c641-7
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:46.840
mermaids.

807f1158-3219-4c77-8705-681568e2bc38-0
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.860
That's interesting.

b677b117-a952-4098-82ba-69920aa276e4-0
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.711
A boat with men, muscle men and
their bathing suits. All the

b677b117-a952-4098-82ba-69920aa276e4-1
00:27:53.711 --> 00:27:55.160
girls are admiring them.

2a09641f-fbe8-43de-b9c0-0c163c01ffe0-0
00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.357
And there's a guy trying to go
under the bridge, and he's with

2a09641f-fbe8-43de-b9c0-0c163c01ffe0-1
00:28:00.357 --> 00:28:03.784
his stick, pulling the boat,
rowing the boat. The little

2a09641f-fbe8-43de-b9c0-0c163c01ffe0-2
00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:07.632
bridge hovers over the river and
people are all standing on the

2a09641f-fbe8-43de-b9c0-0c163c01ffe0-3
00:28:07.632 --> 00:28:11.240
bridge, watching the boats go
by, watching the Ducks go by.

5fc6c800-46cf-4f18-bfdb-6f399163fcf3-0
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.031
then in the center here. There's
two bulls, I don't know if that

5fc6c800-46cf-4f18-bfdb-6f399163fcf3-1
00:28:16.031 --> 00:28:20.075
knowing and little boy, a man
trying to be a bullfighter, he's

5fc6c800-46cf-4f18-bfdb-6f399163fcf3-2
00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:20.910
pretty brave.

86a71f72-cdde-43c4-9c88-7e14dac787e2-0
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.154
Then not sure what these people
are doing. They all have

86a71f72-cdde-43c4-9c88-7e14dac787e2-1
00:28:27.154 --> 00:28:30.786
backpacks that look like they
must have been on a very, very

86a71f72-cdde-43c4-9c88-7e14dac787e2-2
00:28:30.786 --> 00:28:34.418
long hike because they're laying
on the ground now, crawling

86a71f72-cdde-43c4-9c88-7e14dac787e2-3
00:28:34.418 --> 00:28:38.169
along like they don't have any
more energy or strength at all.

30e2e1c2-c16b-408c-948f-e69bb2361607-0
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.945
down below we have tents of
people living in the tents and

30e2e1c2-c16b-408c-948f-e69bb2361607-1
00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:47.566
they're having cookouts and
they're having coffee and

30e2e1c2-c16b-408c-948f-e69bb2361607-2
00:28:47.566 --> 00:28:51.790
they're having fun and they're,
they're out there. No one guys

30e2e1c2-c16b-408c-948f-e69bb2361607-3
00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.539
tent collapsed. That didn't go
too well.

5691119d-9c78-4c43-a894-d1d42dd73bbc-0
00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.380
Pick that up. Another guy's
blowing up and either maybe a

5691119d-9c78-4c43-a894-d1d42dd73bbc-1
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.113
canoe or something he's blowing
up. But there even Indians there

5691119d-9c78-4c43-a894-d1d42dd73bbc-2
00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:04.320
in their little tipi.

fadc83fa-a072-4c27-8332-fbaea526b0a4-0
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.918
Little boys running off from mom
and dad going I wanna go play.

fadc83fa-a072-4c27-8332-fbaea526b0a4-1
00:29:09.918 --> 00:29:13.775
There's more girls admiring the
muscle guys. Ohh there's a man

fadc83fa-a072-4c27-8332-fbaea526b0a4-2
00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:17.693
changing and all the kids caught
him. They pulled back the tent

fadc83fa-a072-4c27-8332-fbaea526b0a4-3
00:29:17.693 --> 00:29:21.550
curtain. Ohh you can see him in
his underwear all embarrassed 

8948f9d3-9b3c-4d2e-ba8a-4aa48a18b0b7-0
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.565
And then there there's another
guy putting a stakes in the

8948f9d3-9b3c-4d2e-ba8a-4aa48a18b0b7-1
00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:28.260
ground. Get his tent to stay up.

84f927b9-a28c-404f-a071-6cbf766e19df-0
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.982
And the different types of
people out here, some are really

84f927b9-a28c-404f-a071-6cbf766e19df-1
00:29:32.982 --> 00:29:33.540
dressed up.

5cecc37f-bbb9-44ff-a5ef-5f866f164c1f-0
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.353
Some are, like crawling along
those backpackers. They're

5cecc37f-bbb9-44ff-a5ef-5f866f164c1f-1
00:29:38.353 --> 00:29:42.434
tired. Some have binoculars.
Some are couples. Some are

5cecc37f-bbb9-44ff-a5ef-5f866f164c1f-2
00:29:42.434 --> 00:29:43.090
families.

f8f7c41f-fbbd-41f8-8a54-b072c9b64374-0
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.486
And now the leader of the hikers
at the backpacks wants them to

f8f7c41f-fbbd-41f8-8a54-b072c9b64374-1
00:29:49.486 --> 00:29:52.511
go further. And they're all
like, no, we can't go any

f8f7c41f-fbbd-41f8-8a54-b072c9b64374-2
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:55.930

can't anymore. We're tired.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.450
Somebody's feeding birds out
there and look doggy.

fbded547-7cd2-4945-afa9-aea1d8ad6757-0
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.393
I'm not sure what those scouts
are doing. There's more people

fbded547-7cd2-4945-afa9-aea1d8ad6757-1
00:30:09.393 --> 00:30:11.600
with the map trying to figure
out which way to go.

4c1164aa-aaec-4624-a717-e9c39f0bb288-0
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.108
#END_campsite As far as those
backpackers, they must be the

4c1164aa-aaec-4624-a717-e9c39f0bb288-1
00:30:16.108 --> 00:30:19.496
stragglers at the end because
they're just down here. Haven't

00:30:19.496 --> 00:30:22.119
got way over here yet. Yeah, so
long way to go.

#START_make_a_splash OK, this
looks like a fun place. Looks

bc0b0daf-9f9e-49a1-865e-523ea5fc0986-1
00:30:50.444 --> 00:30:53.210
like water Power Pack pack park.

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-0
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.376
Going down the different slides,
some slides are like through

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-1
00:30:58.376 --> 00:31:02.130
tunnels and some slides are just
open. So much fun. {I've been on

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-2
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.770
water slides before. They are so
much fun and the kids are just

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-3
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.354
having too much fun in there.}
And there's a big yellow kind a

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-4
00:31:09.354 --> 00:31:12.880
little boys crawling on he's
squirting water and all the kids

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-5
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.236
riding by on their rafts. All
fun a second raft river that

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-6
00:31:16.236 --> 00:31:19.649
they're all floating down. Get
their little boy, the squirt

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-7
00:31:19.649 --> 00:31:22.891
gun, squirt and the rest of
them. And some girls are out

85df54aa-ed22-4731-895b-59176610dcc8-8
00:31:22.891 --> 00:31:25.110
there sunbathing, people are
swimming.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.900
Everywhere.

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-0
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.633
People have big floaties that
they're on. All they've been

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-1
00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:34.672
here is 123456 water slide all
the same. So six people thinking

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-2
00:31:34.672 --> 00:31:38.332
don't go down at once. Big
dragon up there and a big boat

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-3
00:31:38.332 --> 00:31:41.992
for the kids to play on. And
there's a slide off the boat

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-4
00:31:41.992 --> 00:31:45.463
too. How much fun is that? And
of course there's water

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-5
00:31:45.463 --> 00:31:49.313
squirting on somebody from the
boat too. Little boy up there

5e7a4ac1-856d-4304-afc7-b92c340e924e-6
00:31:49.313 --> 00:31:52.089
squirting a kid of the head of
another kid.

56b28cee-5ca6-4952-9ee8-72764ab4489d-0
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.564
{We're staying on one slide
here. Yes, just one. OK,

56b28cee-5ca6-4952-9ee8-72764ab4489d-1
00:32:01.564 --> 00:32:02.190
alright.}

1bc051ae-d717-4b73-98d9-4c220893f5c7-0
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.460
The girl in a bikini and a boy
trying to talk to her. I don't

1bc051ae-d717-4b73-98d9-4c220893f5c7-1
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.640
think she looks nice.

70474c8c-8b7f-4d24-8d01-8652ae7ecf72-0
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:15.080
So many people waiting to go on
the slides.

28bbcf05-5262-4595-9873-fb2e4a96a560-0
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.525
I don't know how they're not
crashing into each other. So

28bbcf05-5262-4595-9873-fb2e4a96a560-1
00:32:19.525 --> 00:32:22.603
many going at one time. It's
always there's 2 girls riding

28bbcf05-5262-4595-9873-fb2e4a96a560-2
00:32:22.603 --> 00:32:25.837
together at the same time, all
fun. I see a Penguin on one of

28bbcf05-5262-4595-9873-fb2e4a96a560-3
00:32:25.837 --> 00:32:27.819
the slides. How do he sneak in
there?

23108fbd-e05a-48fc-ac11-186113b14b24-0
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.672
And we're going down their
stomach and some are sitting up

23108fbd-e05a-48fc-ac11-186113b14b24-1
00:32:33.672 --> 00:32:36.180
and then they're just splashing
into the water.

a265b0eb-2eb6-4b5b-b7e5-aeeee5eac06f-0
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.710
Going in a lot of times they're
going in head first and there's

a265b0eb-2eb6-4b5b-b7e5-aeeee5eac06f-1
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.720
a lifeguard there.

8a855feb-c51b-47b6-8880-2ecd91ad92eb-0
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.560
She's talking to a boy and I
don't think she's paying

8a855feb-c51b-47b6-8880-2ecd91ad92eb-1
00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.480
attention to the people.

33961aa4-7d90-4078-9dd4-c0699c6e1131-0
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.380
She's busy talking to a cute
boy.

8da8c403-0470-45f5-88fd-b0aa4cd14241-0
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.030
That at the river Raft is so
much fun.

d0bb8f94-83e8-4f11-9fba-567eec720660-0
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.700
{I want to be the boy squirting
everybody so.}

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-0
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.586
Well, there's a couple more
lifeguards down there. They're,

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-1
00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:08.295
they're watching out. There's a
mom with their little baby. How

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-2
00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:12.003
cute in the water. Then there's
a giant ball thing. It's like a

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-3
00:33:12.003 --> 00:33:15.712
shower. It rains on the kids and
they're loving it. Running out

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-4
00:33:15.712 --> 00:33:19.073
of all that pouring water down
on them. This looks like a

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-5
00:33:19.073 --> 00:33:22.434
really fun water park.   { I
wish I could go here to this

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-6
00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:25.621
water park. It's so much fun
all. } And there's little

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-7
00:33:25.621 --> 00:33:29.214
stepping stones that you can go
across, go out to this little

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-8
00:33:29.214 --> 00:33:32.401
thing that goes out into the
water, and then you go on

fdf99e3b-4073-4689-8c66-a215725cc301-9
00:33:32.401 --> 00:33:33.560
stepping stones and.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:37.512
That it stay on him looks like
it's kind of hard because a lot

dd6ac55a-49e2-48e6-913b-5456c1f65de5-1
00:33:37.512 --> 00:33:41.457
of the kids are falling off of
them into the water, but that is

dd6ac55a-49e2-48e6-913b-5456c1f65de5-2
00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:42.690
that is so much fun.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.783
there's a kid, he's even on the
Dragon tail, having fun. And the

2527675a-e023-4693-92cb-53889c8250ef-1
00:33:48.783 --> 00:33:52.757
Dragon, Dragon pouring water out
of his mouth too to squirt,

2527675a-e023-4693-92cb-53889c8250ef-2
00:33:52.757 --> 00:33:56.600
everyone. Plenty of places to
get wet in this little park.

04ebd7c2-332f-4fa5-a66a-373dc1a9467d-0
00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.520
There's a cannon on the ship
that shoots water too.

a7592e3b-e737-44a4-b800-d7f2fa51707b-0
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.170
the kids are climbing up the the
the the ship ropes.

f69ffe3d-1eff-4480-a4fe-b8061a3b1323-0
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.362
Probably going up to the the
nest up there where they can see

f69ffe3d-1eff-4480-a4fe-b8061a3b1323-1
00:34:11.362 --> 00:34:15.374
a better view of everyone on
there's a girl on the other side

f69ffe3d-1eff-4480-a4fe-b8061a3b1323-2
00:34:15.374 --> 00:34:17.639
squirting people too. So much
fun.

1cb9a079-34e0-4eb0-a695-0e57eeb0ef36-0
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.438
Oh, there's another lifeguard.
She's standing there watching.

1cb9a079-34e0-4eb0-a695-0e57eeb0ef36-1
00:34:22.438 --> 00:34:25.316
Good, because this one down here
is flocking to the boy. So I'm

1cb9a079-34e0-4eb0-a695-0e57eeb0ef36-2
00:34:25.316 --> 00:34:27.700
glad this one, they're paying
attention to the kids.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.424
So many things. I think it would
be hard to drown here because

942183cd-f6f3-4f78-96bc-677982ca1916-1
00:34:32.424 --> 00:34:35.430
there's too many people.
Somebody would see you, I think.

83a138f9-a624-453b-8ed8-4b3484de8181-0
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:40.727
#END_make_a_splash And help you.
{OK, well, let's take a break.

83a138f9-a624-453b-8ed8-4b3484de8181-1
00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:41.810
We'll come back.}

That's what we just did.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:55.204
And then moving on, you're going
to see another one page complex

55c0b69d-2ad5-4aa6-b4af-9f8ab0239a0d-1

Ohh, learning games in ancient
Rome? This ought to be

2fe8de9b-90e3-4f45-b7b9-b9df504ac7da-1
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.760
interesting.}

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.210
#START_ancient_rome Looks like
the Colosseum.

2f6bfce2-cbe7-48cb-a010-9189bea2a15d-0
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.780
Plenty of people are watching.

b31f5db3-52e5-4ae8-b831-c3e7ca13cb60-0
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.402
But over in the corner the Lions
have decided to dogpile each

b31f5db3-52e5-4ae8-b831-c3e7ca13cb60-1
00:35:24.402 --> 00:35:27.916
other up and get up to the
stands, and they're after the

b31f5db3-52e5-4ae8-b831-c3e7ca13cb60-2
00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:31.677
people, so all the people are
running away from them because

b31f5db3-52e5-4ae8-b831-c3e7ca13cb60-3
00:35:31.677 --> 00:35:35.499
the lions are getting out of the
Colosseum. How scary is that

b31f5db3-52e5-4ae8-b831-c3e7ca13cb60-4
00:35:35.499 --> 00:35:39.569
being chased by lions? He's even
got a hold of one person's toga,

b31f5db3-52e5-4ae8-b831-c3e7ca13cb60-5
00:35:39.569 --> 00:35:42.590
so they're running really fast
with their lives.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.898
The rest of the crowd is still
watching on and then over. In

c6f3aab4-5a8a-4bd2-a42d-4875e2522983-1
00:35:47.898 --> 00:35:52.439
the other corner must be the the
Roman Emperor and his Princess

c6f3aab4-5a8a-4bd2-a42d-4875e2522983-2
00:35:52.439 --> 00:35:56.200
and queen are drawn in front of
him, protecting him.

01d0c445-579f-474d-97a9-3eeb21a10ad3-0
00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.754
And there's some guys with some
mopes. Oh, there they are oh how

01d0c445-579f-474d-97a9-3eeb21a10ad3-1
00:36:00.754 --> 00:36:04.146
did the lion get over there,
another lion over there, either

01d0c445-579f-474d-97a9-3eeb21a10ad3-2
00:36:04.146 --> 00:36:07.260
after it, the lions are out
everywhere, chasing all the

01d0c445-579f-474d-97a9-3eeb21a10ad3-3
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:07.650
people.

9152f8bf-9f40-4741-b9e4-3e08052bea12-0
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.601
Some have whips, some have
swords and they're fighting each

9152f8bf-9f40-4741-b9e4-3e08052bea12-1
00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:11.900
other.

faef9ad2-0382-4282-99a6-c2a291db8e3f-0
00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.075
Some are dead laying on the
floor already. There are a lot

faef9ad2-0382-4282-99a6-c2a291db8e3f-1
00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:20.730
of them have died already
because there's a bunch of sword

faef9ad2-0382-4282-99a6-c2a291db8e3f-2
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.970
fighters down there.

b996e194-ab38-4447-bfbe-c5a0243df9bc-0
00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:26.184
Lot of people are hurt and a lot
of people are laying there dead

b996e194-ab38-4447-bfbe-c5a0243df9bc-1
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:28.280
and then there's some Chariots
with horses.

150c6198-c392-4251-9bdb-562b623cdf40-0
00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.608
Oh, this is different. Usually
the men are running the

150c6198-c392-4251-9bdb-562b623cdf40-1
00:36:32.608 --> 00:36:36.582
Chariots. This time the horse is
running the men. They are the

150c6198-c392-4251-9bdb-562b623cdf40-2
00:36:36.582 --> 00:36:39.610
horses, and then the regular
chairs behind him.

fe9fdddd-9c22-4b5e-982c-3d2b7c63c87e-0
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.505
Then the other guy is falling
out of his chariot and the

fe9fdddd-9c22-4b5e-982c-3d2b7c63c87e-1
00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:46.240
horses are dragging him along.

2d76ff07-9e7f-4c19-89e2-8fd08f950de7-0
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.285
And then oh the lions got
somebody down there too, where

2d76ff07-9e7f-4c19-89e2-8fd08f950de7-1
00:36:51.285 --> 00:36:53.790
those lions are really devouring
everybody.

2752cf84-aeee-4a85-a7e3-afd9832ee280-0
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:59.053
And the people are hurt
everywhere. {I don't think I'd

2752cf84-aeee-4a85-a7e3-afd9832ee280-1
00:36:59.053 --> 00:37:02.943
like this games. I don't think
these are games. }These are like

2752cf84-aeee-4a85-a7e3-afd9832ee280-2
00:37:02.943 --> 00:37:06.530
everybody's getting hurt and
everybody's getting killed in

2752cf84-aeee-4a85-a7e3-afd9832ee280-3
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.260
these games.

b032c315-2cbe-4273-b49b-1eac6f27af11-0
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.370
And people are giving them
thumbs down. They're not

b032c315-2cbe-4273-b49b-1eac6f27af11-1
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:11.840
cheering.

3b5a8be4-8509-45e6-8ba7-d0dd237b8bac-0
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.749
Again, thumbs down for
everybody, I guess. I don't like

3b5a8be4-8509-45e6-8ba7-d0dd237b8bac-1
00:37:16.749 --> 00:37:19.948
the fights. I don't think the
fights are just interesting

3b5a8be4-8509-45e6-8ba7-d0dd237b8bac-2
00:37:19.948 --> 00:37:23.203
enough. That is different.
There's lions. The lions in the

3b5a8be4-8509-45e6-8ba7-d0dd237b8bac-3
00:37:23.203 --> 00:37:25.410
crowd are giving them thumbs
down even.

eb32750b-17a9-4fa6-b960-6ba1eeb1bbcf-0
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.328
There's a man, he's getting
totally dragged by his horses.

eb32750b-17a9-4fa6-b960-6ba1eeb1bbcf-1
00:37:30.328 --> 00:37:32.867
The other one was getting
dragged by the chair, but this

eb32750b-17a9-4fa6-b960-6ba1eeb1bbcf-2
00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:35.629
guy's got the chariots and it's
only the horses dragging him.

e3d1f767-f0ac-48d8-b3db-239aabbdea1b-0
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:42.675
And then the lots of swords and
and and Shields laying

e3d1f767-f0ac-48d8-b3db-239aabbdea1b-1
00:37:42.675 --> 00:37:43.700
everywhere.

518d201b-2b13-4c14-9f37-5aa66e48b9c7-0
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.293
One guy kapow one guy, really
hard on this. Some javelin guys

518d201b-2b13-4c14-9f37-5aa66e48b9c7-1
00:37:49.293 --> 00:37:52.290
in there too, and throwing
javelins at people.

d9e56e25-a8c4-4699-bef2-f75146a2111e-0
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.830
And one's riding on another
one's back.

e7cdb797-201e-445d-8bab-c7538d132767-0
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.798
Boy, what a place. What a mess.
Looks like. Total chaos in here.

e7cdb797-201e-445d-8bab-c7538d132767-1
00:38:01.798 --> 00:38:06.433
Like the lions. Oh, I totally
escaped they. Somebody left all

e7cdb797-201e-445d-8bab-c7538d132767-2
00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:07.479
the lions out.

fa316695-728c-4657-8284-339d86de2810-0
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.031
And another man dragging another
man off and he's trying to grab

fa316695-728c-4657-8284-339d86de2810-1
00:38:13.031 --> 00:38:17.227
into the dirt, but he can't, his
hands are slipping. This is just

fa316695-728c-4657-8284-339d86de2810-2
00:38:17.227 --> 00:38:17.990
total chaos.

ac5d1cf3-c4ac-46b1-9646-5a6512ff581d-0
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.020
#END_ancient_rome What a mess.

6f9fcb87-5f3d-4ec1-a0c0-973a6c1fc155-0
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.420
{We can go on to the next one.

024bba02-ae4c-4f3b-b7bd-32ab361eb9ba-0
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.970
Alright, so this is another
story about 20 pages.

441141d7-1503-44be-bcf7-b7ce4ba16817-0
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.930
And as you go through the story,
just describe what you see,

441141d7-1503-44be-bcf7-b7ce4ba16817-1
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.090
what's happening.

61af130d-0e21-46b1-8083-8b0e5a8f234b-0
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.180
Um, we're aiming for between 10
and 15 minutes for it.}

9d39707b-a681-4530-ac9c-088e1de6000c-0

dedicated to his parents, for my

parents.

d713ba92-2a87-49ce-b9e4-00517a91c1e7-0
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.805
There's one building. Ohh, I
think it looks like the building

d713ba92-2a87-49ce-b9e4-00517a91c1e7-1
00:38:52.805 --> 00:38:56.461
we saw earlier, the street light
and the arrow, and now we're

d713ba92-2a87-49ce-b9e4-00517a91c1e7-2
00:38:56.461 --> 00:39:00.293
seeing inside. There's a man up
there upstairs and it looks like

d713ba92-2a87-49ce-b9e4-00517a91c1e7-3
00:39:00.293 --> 00:39:04.007
a he's got a drafting board and
he's working hard and a little

d713ba92-2a87-49ce-b9e4-00517a91c1e7-4
00:39:04.007 --> 00:39:06.720
red kites trying to come inside
and find him.

3a86177c-3b73-442b-bd13-ca1913c997c5-0
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.325
but it is that little girl's
kite, and the next thing you

3a86177c-3b73-442b-bd13-ca1913c997c5-1
00:39:11.325 --> 00:39:15.380
scene, the kite coming from down
the stairs and down the stairs

3a86177c-3b73-442b-bd13-ca1913c997c5-2
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.435
in the kitchen. There's no one
in the entryway, there's no one.

3a86177c-3b73-442b-bd13-ca1913c997c5-3
00:39:19.435 --> 00:39:23.174
But there is a little girl in
her room and she's drawing a

3a86177c-3b73-442b-bd13-ca1913c997c5-4
00:39:23.174 --> 00:39:27.103
magic door again. I think she's
ready to go through the magic

3a86177c-3b73-442b-bd13-ca1913c997c5-5
00:39:27.103 --> 00:39:27.419
door.

2e227e19-1e95-43a7-92aa-1638ef339fc7-0
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.338
but the dad all of a sudden
turns around and notices the

2e227e19-1e95-43a7-92aa-1638ef339fc7-1
00:39:35.338 --> 00:39:38.817
kite on the floor. So he gets
off from his stool and his draft

2e227e19-1e95-43a7-92aa-1638ef339fc7-2
00:39:38.817 --> 00:39:40.529
board and he picks up the kite.

7fd71101-aeb5-424a-869a-557ffdf7c5f5-0
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.270
And he's looking at it.

6b9a95d6-1b09-4071-bc4a-47ebfb3eb07c-0
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.936
Then all of a sudden you just
see the draft board and the

6b9a95d6-1b09-4071-bc4a-47ebfb3eb07c-1
00:39:45.936 --> 00:39:47.980
chair and the kite. You don't
see the dad.

12be9faf-323e-496b-843b-1b1f7c04b204-0
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:53.018
In the next picture, he's gone
into her room and he notices the

12be9faf-323e-496b-843b-1b1f7c04b204-1
00:39:53.018 --> 00:39:56.739
magic door and he's looking
through it. Will, he go through

12be9faf-323e-496b-843b-1b1f7c04b204-2
00:39:56.739 --> 00:39:57.670
it?  Let's see.

47db4a6c-f863-486c-9e06-5a3bf5fe1072-0
00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.240
And he does go through it, and
he's in the magical forest at

47db4a6c-f863-486c-9e06-5a3bf5fe1072-1
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.901
the little girl was in earlier
and all. But it's night time and

47db4a6c-f863-486c-9e06-5a3bf5fe1072-2
00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:10.620
all the lights are lit up really
brightly and it's so beautiful.

47db4a6c-f863-486c-9e06-5a3bf5fe1072-3
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.167
And the rivers there and the
little pier is there and there's

47db4a6c-f863-486c-9e06-5a3bf5fe1072-4
00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:17.200
little red ball or something on
the end of the pier.

b696fa9d-faed-4ba2-91ec-f588cee5142e-0
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.257
There's a red ball and the dad
is found that he's picked it up

b696fa9d-faed-4ba2-91ec-f588cee5142e-1
00:40:25.257 --> 00:40:28.730
and he's watching this dragon
ship coming down the lake.

5217d372-c9e9-4241-a0d2-0ce88bd12a25-0
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.790
Wonder what it's doing?

8768242a-a814-420a-ae7b-a04a132e6fb8-0
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.969
Now all of a sudden then dragon
ship comes up to him and he hops

8768242a-a814-420a-ae7b-a04a132e6fb8-1
00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:39.651
on board the Dragon ship and it
looks like it's going. As soon

8768242a-a814-420a-ae7b-a04a132e6fb8-2
00:40:39.651 --> 00:40:43.157
as he gets on it starts going
very fast because you can see

8768242a-a814-420a-ae7b-a04a132e6fb8-3
00:40:43.157 --> 00:40:46.547
the tail bent over. So he's
going very fast on the Dragon

8768242a-a814-420a-ae7b-a04a132e6fb8-4
00:40:46.547 --> 00:40:46.840
ship.

b572ceed-ec86-47d8-9e66-f467920f9463-0
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.890
Always coming to the castle.
{I've seen this castle before.}

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-0
00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.535
Reading and looking and looking.
Wondering what's inside that

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-1
00:41:00.535 --> 00:41:04.470
castle. Traveled this castle
through the water though. And

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-2
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.605
the castle still so magnificent.
Many flags on the towers and

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-3
00:41:08.605 --> 00:41:12.874
domes and so beautiful. And then
across the rivers and a bridge

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-4
00:41:12.874 --> 00:41:17.009
that runs across and you can
ride over with on the water. And

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-5
00:41:17.009 --> 00:41:21.078
the little girls are on her
little red boat riding across to

6a292754-75fc-4d1a-b675-6e6dce094a0f-6
00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:25.280
the other side of the castle.
Wonder if the dad will find her.

97b0a555-ceb2-4058-bff9-eb3538fe1603-0
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.250
Dragons boat has stopped and he
jumps off.

e872e9d6-9b0c-4d88-ab99-e54170d58970-0
00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:40.334
And he sees, like a little king
and queen and maybe a Prince and

e872e9d6-9b0c-4d88-ab99-e54170d58970-1
00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:45.618
Princess and a king. Who knows,
ohThere's some magical bird too.

e872e9d6-9b0c-4d88-ab99-e54170d58970-2
00:41:45.618 --> 00:41:48.220
All the soldiers are looking on.

3ff34934-028b-434e-8c5f-3b0ba695aa7d-0
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.840
The dad comes and I think he
wants to talk to his daughter.

ea0b5a8b-51cf-4201-9bd0-595342e3b2b8-0
00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.122
The king looks at it and the
daughter saying no, I am not

ea0b5a8b-51cf-4201-9bd0-595342e3b2b8-1
00:42:00.122 --> 00:42:04.004
talking to him because he got
hurt her feelings earlier and

ea0b5a8b-51cf-4201-9bd0-595342e3b2b8-2
00:42:04.004 --> 00:42:08.080
ignored her little boy said look
at her. But why what's wrong?

a800f123-0c6f-42bc-ba83-ec51980ab668-0
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.544
Then I don't know who's on the
driving ship now. Looks like a

a800f123-0c6f-42bc-ba83-ec51980ab668-1
00:42:21.544 --> 00:42:25.594
soldier. The little boy in it
and the and the king and the dad

a800f123-0c6f-42bc-ba83-ec51980ab668-2
00:42:25.594 --> 00:42:29.578
and the girl. Looks like they
might be scared. You might want

a800f123-0c6f-42bc-ba83-ec51980ab668-3
00:42:29.578 --> 00:42:31.249
to run away from this guy.

2aa2695b-c786-41cc-913a-7946271ba987-0
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.010
Not sure, but it does look like
trouble.

b8b8891a-5c2e-48bd-8cce-fc2137244b91-0
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.424
Now the sudden all these men are
getting off the dragon boat from

b8b8891a-5c2e-48bd-8cce-fc2137244b91-1
00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:44.235
inside and the king saying holds
up a scepter saying no, I'm

b8b8891a-5c2e-48bd-8cce-fc2137244b91-2
00:42:44.235 --> 00:42:47.360
going to protect you. Hopefully
he can save them.

13fb100f-bb66-4f39-8252-2416b599879a-0
00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.562
the king is throwing something
at them and the little girl,

13fb100f-bb66-4f39-8252-2416b599879a-1
00:42:55.562 --> 00:42:59.334
little boy and dad are very much
afraid. We don't know who these

13fb100f-bb66-4f39-8252-2416b599879a-2
00:42:59.334 --> 00:43:01.830
men are, but looks like they
want trouble.

d90ee8df-e031-44da-a2bb-aa0f40f09d3c-0
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.861
the king pulls the sword at him.
Now he's pointing the sword in

d90ee8df-e031-44da-a2bb-aa0f40f09d3c-1
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:07.070
him.

b7bfe846-b023-40e5-b41a-f2c0172452bd-0
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:13.572
The man has some kind of magic
box. It took the sword out of

b7bfe846-b023-40e5-b41a-f2c0172452bd-1
00:43:13.572 --> 00:43:17.336
his hand and right inside the
box. Then the soldiers captured

b7bfe846-b023-40e5-b41a-f2c0172452bd-2
00:43:17.336 --> 00:43:21.161
the king. Oh no, the man runs
away with the box. We don't know

b7bfe846-b023-40e5-b41a-f2c0172452bd-3
00:43:21.161 --> 00:43:23.650
where he's going to the soldiers
running

2be2b031-85b7-43f6-8dd4-bfb91f6ddf99-0
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.211
They're coming after the little
girl that dad and the boy with

2be2b031-85b7-43f6-8dd4-bfb91f6ddf99-1
00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:32.885
the little boy is drawing a
picture. Hopefully, if you'll

2be2b031-85b7-43f6-8dd4-bfb91f6ddf99-2
00:43:32.885 --> 00:43:37.067
help them escape and then all he
draws a giant bird. Now they can

2be2b031-85b7-43f6-8dd4-bfb91f6ddf99-3
00:43:37.067 --> 00:43:41.122
run it and escape to the the man
with the magical boxes soldier

2be2b031-85b7-43f6-8dd4-bfb91f6ddf99-4
00:43:41.122 --> 00:43:44.669
there can't get after them
because they're flying away.

fc254010-a0ff-4a9d-a011-48ba18621ddb-0
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:56.290
Ohh, he's got that magical box,
and the magical box is drawing

fc254010-a0ff-4a9d-a011-48ba18621ddb-1
00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.614
in the bird, the bird that's
drawing it inside the box just

fc254010-a0ff-4a9d-a011-48ba18621ddb-2
00:44:00.614 --> 00:44:02.560
like it did the King sword.

de1b0e0d-f672-4b8c-b6ae-3a9c6ec484de-0
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.249
Oh no, it might take the whole
bird. What will happen to them

de1b0e0d-f672-4b8c-b6ae-3a9c6ec484de-1
00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:10.953
when will they fall in the
water? Will they go inside the

de1b0e0d-f672-4b8c-b6ae-3a9c6ec484de-2
00:44:10.953 --> 00:44:15.167
box? No one knows. We'll have to
see. Nope, it just took the bird

de1b0e0d-f672-4b8c-b6ae-3a9c6ec484de-3
00:44:15.167 --> 00:44:18.680
in. And guess what? Oh the king
caught the little boy.

fba2bc87-7eb0-479a-a016-405cdf544d11-0
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.930
He wouldn't fall.

cf6dfa93-03f8-404b-8f58-ef2bcb9f85e8-0
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.845
He got him to put him in the
ship that with the dad and the

cf6dfa93-03f8-404b-8f58-ef2bcb9f85e8-1
00:44:25.845 --> 00:44:29.100
girl are falling and falling and
falling. Oh no.

8accfbbd-e8b3-463f-8081-6018c9799385-0
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.523
They fall in the water. There's
all kinds of little fishes in

8accfbbd-e8b3-463f-8081-6018c9799385-1
00:44:35.523 --> 00:44:36.130
the water.

7eba77fe-aad4-485a-87f2-f633038a7603-0
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.560
Like that little bird again.

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-0
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:45.009
The girl is drawing something,
and then Dad and her underwater,

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-1
00:44:45.009 --> 00:44:49.340
she's drawing something. I
wonder what she's drawing. She's

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-2
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.599
drawing a submarine under the
water, so beautiful. There's

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-3
00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:58.147
different plants and vegetation.
It's seashells and clams. And

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-4
00:44:58.147 --> 00:45:02.261
they, the dad's driving the boat
and the girls look, the

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-5
00:45:02.261 --> 00:45:06.881
submarine and the girls looking
out to see where they're going.

fbb35285-8337-478e-9734-0e5635e2fad9-6
00:45:06.881 --> 00:45:09.480
They're going on another
adventure.

321c1383-902f-4609-9246-fb1e0444f571-0
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:17.700
Now they come to a cave that has
many markings on the wall of

321c1383-902f-4609-9246-fb1e0444f571-1
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.431
ancient times. That must have
been ancient. People that lived

321c1383-902f-4609-9246-fb1e0444f571-2
00:45:21.431 --> 00:45:24.440
there, there do all their
stories on their walls.

50ddffe9-b7df-492f-8442-3538a21cd5c4-0
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.901
 even through the pictures of
those ships from long ago, they

50ddffe9-b7df-492f-8442-3538a21cd5c4-1
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:32.260
must have been around for some
time.

56e09748-13c2-4846-8dee-16404405885d-0
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.656
No boats, no people and little
animals in this cave that

56e09748-13c2-4846-8dee-16404405885d-1
00:45:38.656 --> 00:45:41.510
they've come into. Very
interesting.

792d3398-dead-4a66-aec9-b959f3e3e70d-0
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:49.376
She's pointing up, saying ohh
hey there's that box. The Magic

792d3398-dead-4a66-aec9-b959f3e3e70d-1
00:45:49.376 --> 00:45:51.000
box is up there drawing it.

e4eab85b-fddb-4e43-9a0d-9454c0eac354-0
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.305
Hmm. That's where where must
have came from long, long ago.

e4eab85b-fddb-4e43-9a0d-9454c0eac354-1
00:45:55.305 --> 00:45:59.028
Her and her dad are looking at
it and birds just sitting there

e4eab85b-fddb-4e43-9a0d-9454c0eac354-2
00:45:59.028 --> 00:45:59.560
with him.

f5344f6f-0c1e-4049-a08d-b59872dcdf68-0
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.910
who knows what's going to happen
next.

46d30622-e467-4388-bc64-9800ce5da1f3-0
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:10.020
Ohh, here comes the Dragon ship
and the soldiers again, and the

46d30622-e467-4388-bc64-9800ce5da1f3-1
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.260
man with the magic box.

4644398e-9673-404a-a73d-daa670dee9f9-0
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:16.152
what are they gonna do now.
Dad's got a crayon. All of a

4644398e-9673-404a-a73d-daa670dee9f9-1
00:46:16.152 --> 00:46:20.024
sudden, dad's drawing something
draws It looks like almost the

4644398e-9673-404a-a73d-daa670dee9f9-2
00:46:20.024 --> 00:46:23.711
door with the bird hanging on a
perch and the little girl's

4644398e-9673-404a-a73d-daa670dee9f9-3
00:46:23.711 --> 00:46:27.583
going. I don't know what he's
drawing and how this is going to

4644398e-9673-404a-a73d-daa670dee9f9-4
00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:29.550
help us, but I'll keep watching.

622ce117-0fef-402c-b34f-89c72215d2c7-0
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:38.461
Oh, so they're hiding and the
man's taking the bird inside the

622ce117-0fef-402c-b34f-89c72215d2c7-1
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:38.640
box

83617fa7-d1c2-4c72-b1f6-8e68e2ffbd5e-0
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.320
but wait, it's a trap!

652d6064-06a9-415b-8ce3-c5c4db634122-0
00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:47.290
it is a good trap. And the man
gets caught in the trap and he's

652d6064-06a9-415b-8ce3-c5c4db634122-1
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.540
caught and they have the magic
box now.

4066e44b-80da-4513-b64e-341ce1800770-0
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.335
Looks like maybe Dad wants to
break that box. It's probably a

4066e44b-80da-4513-b64e-341ce1800770-1
00:46:54.335 --> 00:46:54.890
good idea.

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-0
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.396
Let's see what happens next. He
does. He splashes the box and

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-1
00:47:00.396 --> 00:47:04.731
the giant bird comes out of the
one they sucked in there. Yay.

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-2
00:47:04.731 --> 00:47:08.516
The man still in the box is
broken so it can't be evil

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-3
00:47:08.516 --> 00:47:12.714
anymore. And there's the king
and the boy are happy, and all

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-4
00:47:12.714 --> 00:47:17.187
the things that they've captured
in that box have been released,

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-5
00:47:17.187 --> 00:47:21.522
and brilliant colors burn. The
Reds and Greens and yellows and

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-6
00:47:21.522 --> 00:47:26.064
Blues are just so beautiful. And
the soldiers in the boat are now

00c42a50-9593-4858-8732-864956aae30b-7
00:47:26.064 --> 00:47:26.340
are.

3793a76d-452f-4769-a85c-622c4824406f-0
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.860
afraid of all that stuff.

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-0
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.247
The soldiers in the boat have
gone away. The King and his son

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-1
00:47:37.247 --> 00:47:40.934
and the dad and his daughter are
all happy. And the beautiful

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-2
00:47:40.934 --> 00:47:44.383
colored birds are flying up
above all the birds that have

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-3
00:47:44.383 --> 00:47:48.070
been captured and the big birds
carrying the man and the cage

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-4
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.995
far away. I don't know  where he
is taking them, but I think it's

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-5
00:47:51.995 --> 00:47:55.623
going to be far away. And then
little girls hugging her dad.

e2330d38-cefa-4de3-888a-0d265b4a87b0-6
00:47:55.623 --> 00:47:59.370
Now she's happy with her dad.
Before she wouldn't talk to him.

9d326d46-87db-458d-8fcc-4da4edf7b8fe-0
00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:03.333
And now she loves them again. Is
hugging him and the king and son

9d326d46-87db-458d-8fcc-4da4edf7b8fe-1
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:06.570

00:51:11.175 --> 00:51:14.640

They're fighting little. They're

00:51:30.451 --> 00:51:34.021

00:51:34.021 --> 00:51:37.647

00:51:37.647 --> 00:51:39.290

firing more cannons at the

firing way over there. There's a

an island where there's more

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:30.420

for for leading them to an empty

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.523
And Waldo and Wizard, Whitehead
came to the land of the

f5937a25-6585-4430-9935-95f1ed211d03-1
00:54:01.523 --> 00:54:05.126
unfriendly giants for many
waldos have been before, and

f5937a25-6585-4430-9935-95f1ed211d03-2
00:54:05.126 --> 00:54:08.794
waldo saw that giants were
horribly harassing the little

00:54:08.794 --> 00:54:12.526
people. And when he found the

f5937a25-6585-4430-9935-95f1ed211d03-4
00:54:12.526 --> 00:54:16.452
continue with his journey. So
apparently this is the land of

f5937a25-6585-4430-9935-95f1ed211d03-5
00:54:16.452 --> 00:54:17.160
the Giants.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:22.828
They are very big giants, and
their houses look so little and

9ce1b9bd-8fd9-4a23-84da-2f0bd7f28855-1
00:54:22.828 --> 00:54:26.665
that's with the little people
live, though, and they're

9ce1b9bd-8fd9-4a23-84da-2f0bd7f28855-2
00:54:26.665 --> 00:54:30.982
they're not being nice to little
people at all. They're making

9ce1b9bd-8fd9-4a23-84da-2f0bd7f28855-3
00:54:30.982 --> 00:54:35.162
them dig and shovel and then
they're playing a board game of

00:54:35.162 --> 00:54:39.136
chess, and I'm moving the
pirates around. I did the chess

9ce1b9bd-8fd9-4a23-84da-2f0bd7f28855-5
00:54:39.136 --> 00:54:43.522
or checkers, but they're still
the jumping with the real little

9ce1b9bd-8fd9-4a23-84da-2f0bd7f28855-6
00:54:43.522 --> 00:54:47.633
people. It's little people,
little people. Giants are using

9ce1b9bd-8fd9-4a23-84da-2f0bd7f28855-7
00:54:47.633 --> 00:54:48.729
them as, as, as.

ea9b3e4b-9fbd-49cc-8f6d-eb5c22fb6d6b-0
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.370
It's just pawns in a game.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.010
Then they're throwing rocks at
the little people.

cc47cadc-6312-45ff-95cc-396bd63bacf4-0
00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.642
And then they're shipping all
the the water, the lakes that

cc47cadc-6312-45ff-95cc-396bd63bacf4-1
00:55:00.642 --> 00:55:03.864
they have, they're drinking them
all dry with their straws.

cc47cadc-6312-45ff-95cc-396bd63bacf4-2
00:55:03.864 --> 00:55:05.690
They're sucking up all the
water.

81643653-42e3-4a71-a10c-ffd6c649640b-0
00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.043
Then all the little people have
a big catapult thing that's

81643653-42e3-4a71-a10c-ffd6c649640b-1
00:55:11.043 --> 00:55:13.910
going to konk on the head of one
of the Giants.

f7ba0be3-b1eb-479e-8822-9e56f99e533e-0
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:16.290
Knock him out.

dfd69d57-0a5c-4697-a0b9-792b6425edc0-0
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.280
When there's a two giants in
love.

3053d3dd-5be8-4a38-bfa0-5a8bd1f6ee0c-0
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.007
Big giant lady. I don't think
she's real. She's not real. And

3053d3dd-5be8-4a38-bfa0-5a8bd1f6ee0c-1
00:55:25.007 --> 00:55:29.168
the Giants giving her flowers. I
think she's a statue, right? Oh,

3053d3dd-5be8-4a38-bfa0-5a8bd1f6ee0c-2
00:55:29.168 --> 00:55:33.138
it's a decoy. So they can count
them on the head. Yes. So when

3053d3dd-5be8-4a38-bfa0-5a8bd1f6ee0c-3
00:55:33.138 --> 00:55:37.236
you walked up to her, he's going
to get konked on the head. He's

3053d3dd-5be8-4a38-bfa0-5a8bd1f6ee0c-4
00:55:37.236 --> 00:55:39.190
not a very bright dragon giant.

f68a2f5a-3c80-43df-b71b-5d2f605d8426-0
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.790
And then they have oh. Then they
have a they're going to trip

f68a2f5a-3c80-43df-b71b-5d2f605d8426-1
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:48.547
this guy with a noose on a rope
with little people, have him on

f68a2f5a-3c80-43df-b71b-5d2f605d8426-2
00:55:48.547 --> 00:55:52.070
one end and the giants going to
trip him with the other end

f74c8108-3752-4e10-93a2-6ec412373d1c-0
00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.450
That's funny.

f9bbebdb-87b3-440e-aa82-46d8fe4785cd-0
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.891
And guys walking around with
people in his belt, little

f9bbebdb-87b3-440e-aa82-46d8fe4785cd-1
00:55:58.891 --> 00:56:01.360
people in his belt, that's not
very nice.

8dc45ba3-b213-4fb4-b03e-6c73bded64b3-0
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.117
Then they got up on the cast and
they're throwing rocks at the

8dc45ba3-b213-4fb4-b03e-6c73bded64b3-1
00:56:05.117 --> 00:56:06.850
Giants, hoping that'll knock
them out.

2d4523ce-c609-40ac-956b-aba2b53214f3-0
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:10.120
There's more of those things
that count them on the head.

beb8310e-294c-43b4-8e4d-d3468e66294b-0
00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.253
Was sitting up there just
looking silly because he got

beb8310e-294c-43b4-8e4d-d3468e66294b-1
00:56:14.253 --> 00:56:17.812
conked on the head and then the
Giants got taken the the

beb8310e-294c-43b4-8e4d-d3468e66294b-2
00:56:17.812 --> 00:56:21.495
windmill and spinning it around
really fast. You need that

beb8310e-294c-43b4-8e4d-d3468e66294b-3
00:56:21.495 --> 00:56:25.241
windmill and the other ones
pulling trees out of the ground

beb8310e-294c-43b4-8e4d-d3468e66294b-4
00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:28.550
and knocking people out of it.
That's not very nice.

eb396dad-05f1-4f8f-8276-f4e24cee79d8-0
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.906
And the one giant is tipping his
hat to the little people. Little

eb396dad-05f1-4f8f-8276-f4e24cee79d8-1
00:56:35.906 --> 00:56:39.887
women people. He must think
they're pretty, but he's too big

eb396dad-05f1-4f8f-8276-f4e24cee79d8-2
00:56:39.887 --> 00:56:41.910
for them. Way too big for them.

efe27e15-e9e4-45c7-bf5e-eab8dceec33a-0
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.475
Sure, not knowing what they're
doing with that rope. I think

efe27e15-e9e4-45c7-bf5e-eab8dceec33a-1
00:56:48.475 --> 00:56:52.048
he's trying to trip that guy,
but the little people might get

efe27e15-e9e4-45c7-bf5e-eab8dceec33a-2
00:56:52.048 --> 00:56:55.507
caught oh he's got a noose
around the little people too. So

efe27e15-e9e4-45c7-bf5e-eab8dceec33a-3
00:56:55.507 --> 00:56:59.080
when the giant puts his foot in
that noose, the little people

efe27e15-e9e4-45c7-bf5e-eab8dceec33a-4
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.192
are going to get swept up
together in a noose. Oh no,

efe27e15-e9e4-45c7-bf5e-eab8dceec33a-5
00:57:02.192 --> 00:57:03.229
that's very scary.

68c5b16a-5ec3-4ec9-a876-4e147af3b82f-0
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.097
And then there's some swordsmen
and their horses I guess they're

68c5b16a-5ec3-4ec9-a876-4e147af3b82f-1
00:57:11.097 --> 00:57:14.245
coming to fight the giants, but
I don't think they have much of

68c5b16a-5ec3-4ec9-a876-4e147af3b82f-2
00:57:14.245 --> 00:57:16.410
a chance because they're giants
are so big.

0bdb2c36-0de5-4bdc-90bb-1aa458e3448f-0
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:18.810
Poor little houses.

726a4b18-0f84-4ba3-8ccb-50aac299917f-0
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.995
Ohh over here is another decoy.
Another guy going this is not

726a4b18-0f84-4ba3-8ccb-50aac299917f-1
00:57:22.995 --> 00:57:25.972
bringing her flowers. He's going
to try and kiss her and get

726a4b18-0f84-4ba3-8ccb-50aac299917f-2
00:57:25.972 --> 00:57:26.899
conked on the head.

f55de086-4cb6-40aa-8d76-6ecb6de02f2a-0
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.039
That's pretty funny. Oh, and
this guy up here walking around

f55de086-4cb6-40aa-8d76-6ecb6de02f2a-1
00:57:32.039 --> 00:57:36.067
in the river? He's going to get
punched on the side of the face,

f55de086-4cb6-40aa-8d76-6ecb6de02f2a-2
00:57:36.067 --> 00:57:40.094
so they got to punch in ramming
rod, yeah, but up above him, the

f55de086-4cb6-40aa-8d76-6ecb6de02f2a-3
00:57:40.094 --> 00:57:44.122
guys lifting the whole house up
the giant hope the people aren't

f55de086-4cb6-40aa-8d76-6ecb6de02f2a-4
00:57:44.122 --> 00:57:44.680
in there.

69d8000d-9379-482d-94e1-68206707fdb5-0
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.201
On this guy's got a sword
through their house. That's not

69d8000d-9379-482d-94e1-68206707fdb5-1
00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:51.850
very nice.

fec470cb-483c-4897-9d75-f46df2133478-0
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:56.668
All the other ones inside the
house because the whole roof is

fec470cb-483c-4897-9d75-f46df2133478-1
00:57:56.668 --> 00:57:59.960
on his head and they took it off
the off the house. Jeez.

f8cc947a-2281-45bb-88d8-1d13c605f605-0
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.048
They hope. They hope they can
beat these giants, but I don't

f8cc947a-2281-45bb-88d8-1d13c605f605-1
00:58:04.048 --> 00:58:05.480
know. There's a lot of them.

ccbbf639-4825-4cfb-a5a7-566ce5ad5804-0
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.310

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:17.360
{OK, that was good. You can go
on to the next one.}

fb4e1629-8046-4d2a-ba9f-9c6bb9b19d24-0

{This.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.050
All right. So again, describe
the scene.}

021c8b32-e1df-4f36-bbce-34a87f379675-0
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:45.813
#START_picture_this phew look at
all those framed portraits,

021c8b32-e1df-4f36-bbce-34a87f379675-1
00:58:45.813 --> 00:58:49.356
although they may be colorfully
different. Some of these are

021c8b32-e1df-4f36-bbce-34a87f379675-2
00:58:49.356 --> 00:58:52.957
characters have met on other
travels. There are also some who

021c8b32-e1df-4f36-bbce-34a87f379675-3
00:58:52.957 --> 00:58:56.616

can you spot for the characters

00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:59.811
that appear twice in this
picture display. Spectacular

021c8b32-e1df-4f36-bbce-34a87f379675-5
00:58:59.811 --> 00:59:03.412
display. {My goodness, where do
we start? } Start at the top.

021c8b32-e1df-4f36-bbce-34a87f379675-6
00:59:03.412 --> 00:59:04.399
There's a dragon.

b82e5320-5db1-4125-9868-c4e1719bbe08-0
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:10.378
And then there's a guy that
looks like he's surfing on top

b82e5320-5db1-4125-9868-c4e1719bbe08-1
00:59:10.378 --> 00:59:11.680
of a guy laying on the water.

f3879a15-3c7a-4442-85be-8b06c9f5b6df-0
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:15.240
And there's a kid upside down.

fce774a4-b3ea-4df8-9c22-54287d4b1d7f-0
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:22.849
And then there's a guy with a
guillotine type of sword and

fce774a4-b3ea-4df8-9c22-54287d4b1d7f-1
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:24.140
little doggy.

be9e8153-bc2c-45b9-aec3-733b916c89c3-0
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.990
And then there's a man and a
wheelbarrow pushing the guy.

7a5f2883-6b30-402e-a84b-eaa932bea7de-0
00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:31.960
And there's a camel and there's.

fa7f967b-b99e-4b19-8560-ff51e5f479c1-0
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:38.320
2 characters are dressed up. I'm
not sure why they look like the

fa7f967b-b99e-4b19-8560-ff51e5f479c1-1
00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.690
clown joke that the castle
jokers.

f3328388-4dcd-49e3-a474-1768ac5f5ff9-0
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.635
There's the giant again. Have
his head through the roof. I

f3328388-4dcd-49e3-a474-1768ac5f5ff9-1
00:59:45.635 --> 00:59:46.500
recognize him.

394b89b2-ab26-4494-b72e-4e8d3160d94a-0
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.000
There's a rhinoceros.

71c12fe4-16d1-47ac-b482-d21138f2ca6e-0
00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:53.180
And there's alien, it looks
like.

773569ca-892e-4e43-b123-6bc13aaf69e5-0
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:58.570
There's a guy playing some music
and there's a double headed

773569ca-892e-4e43-b123-6bc13aaf69e5-1
00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:02.610
fish, fish, 2 heads on each head
on each side of them.

0e0c7403-c08c-4ab5-9451-43df26540277-0
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.160
And there's two sumo wrestlers.

8392c2b9-21dc-49fb-bc5a-7547eec23c79-0
01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.530
And there's a.

a065c2d1-87bc-4741-9f56-42e7b50ab7d3-0
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.770
Hand.

6e9dbd9f-2369-4ac6-8031-eb3735981b8c-0
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:16.108
and there is earrings. You can't
really tell what That is there's

6e9dbd9f-2369-4ac6-8031-eb3735981b8c-1
01:00:16.108 --> 01:00:19.810
a fish person, the top of this
body's a fish, and the bottom is

6e9dbd9f-2369-4ac6-8031-eb3735981b8c-2
01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:20.100
legs.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.995
Right there. He's right there.
And then there's a girl, a blue

dce62d48-3689-49eb-81fa-42f56967bc93-1
01:00:26.995 --> 01:00:28.810
girl with yellow hair.

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.600
Businessman, but he's got fins
on.

02176a6d-92db-4128-be86-e5647ee3352a-0
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.790
Crazy people and these pictures
look kind of silly.

329903f3-9c4b-4059-b765-d219ec5ddb93-0
01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.220
And then we have.

f18f7a0d-1f15-4ab8-a73a-9e9fc8457933-0
01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:45.637
A guy playing, playing a horn,
but it doesn't look like a horn.

f18f7a0d-1f15-4ab8-a73a-9e9fc8457933-1
01:00:45.637 --> 01:00:47.860
It almost looks like an umbrella
he's playing.

c2f02e78-1591-4fc9-abba-c0b1d17631c9-0
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.256
there is a dog trying to get
some food or taste of cat up

c2f02e78-1591-4fc9-abba-c0b1d17631c9-1
01:00:52.256 --> 01:00:55.210
there? Looks like there's a cat
he's trying to get and a mummy.

f09ce4ce-77f0-4f45-9c22-f207200f628d-0
01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:58.420

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:07.380
and there's a guy inside a suit
of armor punching another guy,

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.791
his hands coming out of the

off a little man.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.271
And there's a guy floating on
water, and he's got his fins and

c4539aa0-4c23-4b5a-beb9-bac850317d8a-1
01:01:22.271 --> 01:01:27.223
his snorkel water just gushing
up on him. A couple guys riding

at a girl in a bathing suit.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.993
And the guy walking look like
something's gonna drop on his

faster.

There's a bodybuilder, but he's
opposite. His legs are big and

01:01:48.436 --> 01:01:51.876
his top of his body is real
small. He better work out the

plenty of saloons and plenty of

01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:06.698

chasing the guy. Ohh, the cops,

01:03:06.698 --> 01:03:09.798
the sheriff's chasing. The guy
just robbed the bank or

652b3464-b7c1-428e-b41d-df4241762f2a-2
01:03:09.798 --> 01:03:13.068
something because he's got
money. A bag of money with him

01:03:13.068 --> 01:03:16.507
so he's chasing after him. And
yeah, the saloon, they have a

playing, they've got some

fiddles and guitars and pianos

01:03:22.821 --> 01:03:23.160

up there watch. Oh, they're

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:39.042
looks like they're filming the
whole thing. They're filming a

f5f39f4d-de7e-4ee5-afc2-c9da5ec2e797-2
01:03:39.042 --> 01:03:42.467

got a camera and by the director

01:03:42.467 --> 01:03:45.624

01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:51.992
whatever he's saying he's on a
horse and this horse is rearing

01:03:51.992 --> 01:03:54.721
up and they're all waving
goodbye to him. And then

f5f39f4d-de7e-4ee5-afc2-c9da5ec2e797-7
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:55.150

checking into a hotel.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.223
And the livery unstable livery
stable and the blacksmith

a1455cc0-d39d-4cd0-a00b-9a4a5995afad-1
01:04:05.223 --> 01:04:07.830
working away and making some
horseshoes.

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:14.279
And, and I'm not sure what
they're doing out in front of

13b43328-b0a8-41a3-b884-d52c842a8691-1
01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:17.903
that livery stable. Very
interesting. And it looks like

13b43328-b0a8-41a3-b884-d52c842a8691-2
01:04:17.903 --> 01:04:21.916
they're all they're washing out.
Washing out. Ohh, painting a

13b43328-b0a8-41a3-b884-d52c842a8691-3
01:04:21.916 --> 01:04:25.929
house up on top here in the old
old More One more saloon. One

13b43328-b0a8-41a3-b884-d52c842a8691-4
01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:30.007
more saloon means I guess that's
all they need in this town is

13b43328-b0a8-41a3-b884-d52c842a8691-5
01:04:30.007 --> 01:04:30.590
one more.

of it on the deck that some

01:04:36.216 --> 01:04:39.812
reason they got a cannon. I'm
not sure why. It doesn't sound

0ee696fd-b769-4f49-b0d5-bdc599852cda-2
01:04:39.812 --> 01:04:43.645
like they're up to anything good
at the Pioneer saloon. Oh, they

0ee696fd-b769-4f49-b0d5-bdc599852cda-3
01:04:43.645 --> 01:04:46.947
got robbed the banks that
sheriff's caught them though.

0ee696fd-b769-4f49-b0d5-bdc599852cda-4
01:04:46.947 --> 01:04:50.602
And the sheriff's have guns on
them now. Taking them probably

0ee696fd-b769-4f49-b0d5-bdc599852cda-5
01:04:50.602 --> 01:04:51.310
to the jail.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:58.730
And then say these two on top of
this saloon are just up to no

2fa6d54d-6d1f-455a-bf0a-8cbecde3584d-1
01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:04.178
good, like breaking windows,
something in the hotel, or the

2fa6d54d-6d1f-455a-bf0a-8cbecde3584d-2
01:05:04.178 --> 01:05:05.540
hotel's a mess.

f6b6eb59-5118-4544-a527-cff5eb3788dd-0
01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:10.196
People coming out of the
chimneys, windows broken out. I

f6b6eb59-5118-4544-a527-cff5eb3788dd-1
01:05:10.196 --> 01:05:12.530
don't think I want to stay at
that hotel.

82fb3c1e-1026-4e1f-ad5d-374fb30479ab-0
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.030
And there's plenty. For some
reason, there's a bunch of.

165eaa45-664f-46f2-8fd8-55ed27992c7d-0
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.344
Stamps. That looks like with
bulls on them. Then there's the

165eaa45-664f-46f2-8fd8-55ed27992c7d-1
01:05:23.344 --> 01:05:28.548
jail on The Wanted poster right
by the jail sheriff out in front

01:05:28.548 --> 01:05:30.150
of arresting people.

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:36.737
And then over here there's a
bunch of ohh, they're up there

becd8ccb-fa29-4dfb-9b20-96e58d1f6402-1
01:05:36.737 --> 01:05:40.393
buying stuff on the top of this
saloon and they're all drinking

becd8ccb-fa29-4dfb-9b20-96e58d1f6402-2
01:05:40.393 --> 01:05:41.249

They're filming in that saloon
too, another movie they're

0e144a12-184e-4a49-b798-56d17d4a8f07-1
01:05:45.271 --> 01:05:46.100

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.098
filming all of the people, and
there's a few. One of those big

b763f6d7-942a-4e5c-9c7a-e897e0670f63-1
01:05:50.098 --> 01:05:53.510
long pole things for the camera.
Oh, that's for sound, I think.

b763f6d7-942a-4e5c-9c7a-e897e0670f63-2
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:55.110
So they can hear them talking.

01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:59.996
And then there there's the bank
over there. Looks like nobody's

ceb835f4-9b5a-43bb-b96a-91662251ac64-1
01:05:59.996 --> 01:06:02.000
nobody's robbing the bank at
this time.

Stagecoach gets across before

that Stagecoach off the train

b25cd849-52f0-405f-a8f5-c611502905ba-1
01:06:16.298 --> 01:06:19.707

movie, because I see another

#START_arrival-2 In that first
picture, there's some women

4450e2e0-9246-42d2-aa84-960f848fe5d6-1
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.923
woman sitting there looks like
they're getting ready to travel

4450e2e0-9246-42d2-aa84-960f848fe5d6-2
01:07:44.923 --> 01:07:48.188
somewhere because they have
suitcases. And the next one

4450e2e0-9246-42d2-aa84-960f848fe5d6-3
01:07:48.188 --> 01:07:51.569
there's a men are sitting there
with their suitcases too.

240d5385-eb97-4a6e-9165-d773c34f45ad-0
01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.289
And then there's a woman with a
baby, so she's getting ready to

240d5385-eb97-4a6e-9165-d773c34f45ad-1
01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:57.000
travel also.

c0a34646-c27c-417b-9be6-84377f7dd3af-0
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:01.877
Then the man sitting there
writing in his book, not sure

c0a34646-c27c-417b-9be6-84377f7dd3af-1
01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:05.666
what he's writing, he's writing
a bit and he's writing it. And

c0a34646-c27c-417b-9be6-84377f7dd3af-2
01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.290
then he tears the page out.

f55cf01a-ef33-43e7-b781-49cad5e7e0c5-0
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.567
Back. He tears the page out.
He's making something and looks

f55cf01a-ef33-43e7-b781-49cad5e7e0c5-1
01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:18.191
like a little swan bird and a
little bird with it. Whatever he

f55cf01a-ef33-43e7-b781-49cad5e7e0c5-2
01:08:18.191 --> 01:08:22.889
wrote on that page and he holds
it in his hand, he's looking at

f55cf01a-ef33-43e7-b781-49cad5e7e0c5-3
01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:23.109
it.

8293e27d-73ad-479e-84f8-53b40ab1b04c-0
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.176
And then the next picture, it's
gone. I'm not sure what he did

8293e27d-73ad-479e-84f8-53b40ab1b04c-1
01:08:27.176 --> 01:08:27.520
with it.

56191059-7f0a-4c71-90ad-67bbc8397d47-0
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:31.810
The next picture is walking by.

11e92e53-5f47-481e-865a-9ec8231c1658-0
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:37.685
Then there's a man with a hat
and he's looking away and all of

11e92e53-5f47-481e-865a-9ec8231c1658-1
01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:41.070
a sudden he he looks back and
he's looking up in the sky.

02f7f61c-9260-412c-b19c-b033b07f662b-0
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:45.905
And all of a sudden there's a
bunch of those little birds that

02f7f61c-9260-412c-b19c-b033b07f662b-1
01:08:45.905 --> 01:08:49.364
he made, million of them flying
all over the sky. And

02f7f61c-9260-412c-b19c-b033b07f662b-2
01:08:49.364 --> 01:08:53.464
everybody's looking up at them.
They're on the boat and they're

02f7f61c-9260-412c-b19c-b033b07f662b-3
01:08:53.464 --> 01:08:57.372
like little seagulls flying
over. The boat must be traveling

02f7f61c-9260-412c-b19c-b033b07f662b-4
01:08:57.372 --> 01:08:59.230
somewhere to another country.

3183f3f8-65fd-42b2-b46f-0b07a5279f0f-0
01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.886
Ohh sure enough, they're coming.
They're coming into port to

3183f3f8-65fd-42b2-b46f-0b07a5279f0f-1
01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:12.734
another country. There's a lot
of people on that boat and

3183f3f8-65fd-42b2-b46f-0b07a5279f0f-2
01:09:12.734 --> 01:09:17.046
there's a lot of boats around in
the city. Is in the background,

3183f3f8-65fd-42b2-b46f-0b07a5279f0f-3
01:09:17.046 --> 01:09:18.969
can barely make out the city.

a5530c52-b2bd-4231-8311-ea1104b7fc7e-0
01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.366
And the next picture, that road
is coming in and there's two

a5530c52-b2bd-4231-8311-ea1104b7fc7e-1
01:09:24.366 --> 01:09:28.485
giant statues. I'm not sure what
they are. One is a bird on them

a5530c52-b2bd-4231-8311-ea1104b7fc7e-2
01:09:28.485 --> 01:09:29.690
and one looks like.

8e3d12b6-9fa9-4451-a56b-40c3a15de0a7-0
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:31.780
maybe a rabbit

8dd32c42-07fe-4c79-8491-9195039b209d-0
01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:37.493
I'm not sure. I think it might
be it might be a rabbit too. And

8dd32c42-07fe-4c79-8491-9195039b209d-1
01:09:37.493 --> 01:09:40.905
they're shaking hands and
they're and they have giant

8dd32c42-07fe-4c79-8491-9195039b209d-2
01:09:40.905 --> 01:09:44.822
suitcase on one and a vase and a
bowl and the other one has a

8dd32c42-07fe-4c79-8491-9195039b209d-3
01:09:44.822 --> 01:09:48.360
giant jar and a cup. Not sure
what they're doing there.

469d6453-9829-4085-a2ce-ac5efbd7ecdc-0
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.160
Looks like they're welcoming
each other though.

29bdb103-0240-488f-bb12-f5af00fd3f19-0
01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.699
Here comes the ship in the park
and everybody's on deck. There's

29bdb103-0240-488f-bb12-f5af00fd3f19-1
01:10:00.699 --> 01:10:02.230
a lot of people up there.

b21f01eb-5946-4f18-bbc0-74378c9f7987-0
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.980
And the people?

b338cd5a-545e-45fd-9d82-1239c755e01b-0
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.570
All gathered together and a
man's making announcements, say

b338cd5a-545e-45fd-9d82-1239c755e01b-1
01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:14.525
he has a megaphone telling them
what to do, and there are

b338cd5a-545e-45fd-9d82-1239c755e01b-2
01:10:14.525 --> 01:10:19.025
locking the gates and the people
have got their suitcases and all

b338cd5a-545e-45fd-9d82-1239c755e01b-3
01:10:19.025 --> 01:10:22.230
their belongings and they're
exiting the ship.

30ec5883-75ba-4b85-8faa-19463bc27ff6-0
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.184
#END_arrival-2 All exiting. Lots
of them. Many of them. And then

30ec5883-75ba-4b85-8faa-19463bc27ff6-1
01:10:27.184 --> 01:10:30.187
they're all in a line with their
suitcases and all their

30ec5883-75ba-4b85-8faa-19463bc27ff6-2
01:10:30.187 --> 01:10:33.033
belongings, waiting for
something. Waiting in a long,

30ec5883-75ba-4b85-8faa-19463bc27ff6-3
01:10:33.033 --> 01:10:33.560
long line.

a51f5b9b-3ec8-4e6d-b8e8-b5ed65d02789-0
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.808
{OK, that was the story. Let me
see if we have time to do one

a51f5b9b-3ec8-4e6d-b8e8-b5ed65d02789-1

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:49.620
{One more complex scene. What do
you think? OK, why not?}

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.040
{Yeah, OK.

184b5ce9-bedd-4d0b-aa61-c36790bbcbe6-0
01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.370
But this one is not as busy.}

he is going on a hike this time

73b53815-7353-4f90-844c-2e1a0d053256-0
01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.150

picture now

7a4c8f34-5399-4c64-a12d-fe8e7189d8b7-0
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.136
It's up above, there's a little
school and everybody's walking

7a4c8f34-5399-4c64-a12d-fe8e7189d8b7-1
01:11:32.136 --> 01:11:35.073
to school and the parents are
walking the kids in and some are

7a4c8f34-5399-4c64-a12d-fe8e7189d8b7-2
01:11:35.073 --> 01:11:37.730
walking by their selves and
they're all going to school.

ca14a802-9e01-4176-8a34-04078ad85d31-0
01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:42.542
Street next to the school with
the crossing guard is stop the

01:11:42.542 --> 01:11:45.300
cars so the kids can get across
the school safely.

e7ef34f9-bb99-46e5-9612-15b4a9c0de84-0
01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.990
And then across the street, who
knows? It looks like a.

88f7e7d4-35ef-4aa6-ba30-3319a093656c-0
01:11:51.610 --> 01:11:54.340
It might be a hospital or
something because I see the

88f7e7d4-35ef-4aa6-ba30-3319a093656c-1
01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.222
nurse and the doctor and the
ambulance and it looks like

88f7e7d4-35ef-4aa6-ba30-3319a093656c-2
01:11:57.222 --> 01:12:00.256
there's been a bike crash, so
they're going out to help the

88f7e7d4-35ef-4aa6-ba30-3319a093656c-3
01:12:00.256 --> 01:12:00.610
people.

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.346
When you see the people on the
street, there's a fire engine,

31f84c02-3392-4234-8777-37ee4867906b-1
01:12:06.346 --> 01:12:10.030
fire truck. It's a store where
people are looking in window

31f84c02-3392-4234-8777-37ee4867906b-2
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:13.530
shopping and this guy up
watching this TV in the window.

6b61a79d-7e1a-409c-a740-905174fafab3-0
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.926
People are saying hello to each
other and down below there's a

6b61a79d-7e1a-409c-a740-905174fafab3-1
01:12:18.926 --> 01:12:22.408
shoe store and they're all
looking at the shoes. And then a

6b61a79d-7e1a-409c-a740-905174fafab3-2
01:12:22.408 --> 01:12:26.006
ladies at the gas station. Oh,
looks like she crashed her car

6b61a79d-7e1a-409c-a740-905174fafab3-3
01:12:26.006 --> 01:12:27.980
though. Looks pretty crashed
out.

dc3933a3-b858-42ff-80c8-5d49252ce7ae-0
01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.004
Gas pumps there and this little
truck out in front. the

dc3933a3-b858-42ff-80c8-5d49252ce7ae-1

this town.

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-0
01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.492
They're over there, so
policeman's running up so they

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-1
01:12:44.492 --> 01:12:47.809
don't get in a fight and you can
settle what happened. There's

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-2
01:12:47.809 --> 01:12:51.178
two policemen running from each
direction. Then there's a bunch

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-3
01:12:51.178 --> 01:12:54.074
of people going to the Barber
shop. They must all need

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-4
01:12:54.074 --> 01:12:57.285
haircuts. Very busy day. And a
bunch of them coming out with

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-5
01:12:57.285 --> 01:13:00.233
their hair already cut. Nice
little Cafe and their guys

01:13:00.233 --> 01:13:03.340
pouring coffee, but he's not
paying attention because he's

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-7
01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.604
looking at the pretty girl. It's
spilling coffee all over the

8db995e0-4c4d-4bae-8577-a920d0b80ab3-8

5e9ea2d7-6cd0-4665-8cd6-bdd852cdeb19-0
01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.424
And these guys are working on
the building next door, and then

5e9ea2d7-6cd0-4665-8cd6-bdd852cdeb19-1
01:13:11.424 --> 01:13:14.571
the guy dropped something that's
gonna fall on this guy's head if

5e9ea2d7-6cd0-4665-8cd6-bdd852cdeb19-2
01:13:14.571 --> 01:13:16.050
you don't walk too fast enough.

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:21.252
Standing out there in the
center, there's a waterfall, or

e7b71389-cde9-4833-85d8-74bbc9d6c2d1-1
01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:25.622
there's a guy that that same guy
in the waterfalls, snorkeling

e7b71389-cde9-4833-85d8-74bbc9d6c2d1-2
01:13:25.622 --> 01:13:29.160
his and his flippers in the
waterfall, having fun.

b1e15954-32cf-42ea-aa0d-d1febb59bae2-0
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.240
Guess he's hot.

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:36.944
And that the hotel, there's a
fancy hotel and they're letting

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-1
01:13:36.944 --> 01:13:40.454
in the guest. There's a doorman
of welcoming them, but there's

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-2
01:13:40.454 --> 01:13:43.908
mischief on the roof. There's a
guy and there's a cat they're

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-3
01:13:43.908 --> 01:13:47.530
trying to say they're trying to
get their dog or something from.

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-4
01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:50.984
They got on the roof. On the
other roof there's cleaners, but

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-5
01:13:50.984 --> 01:13:54.160
they're not cleaning. They got
buckets on their head and

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-6
01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.447
they're mops and they're playing
swords like they're sword

ced074f0-12df-43f4-ac88-6c2cf120b506-7
01:13:57.447 --> 01:13:58.450
fighting, I guess.

22b9c879-80ba-43fc-bfba-4ea643b1e5cd-0
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.440
And that other cleaners, that is
just the other workers just

22b9c879-80ba-43fc-bfba-4ea643b1e5cd-1
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.481
feeding the birds while they
goof around with their mops and

22b9c879-80ba-43fc-bfba-4ea643b1e5cd-2
01:14:05.481 --> 01:14:05.880
buckets.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:11.156
And there's one girl in there
working and another guy working

90f599c5-5677-4d86-af63-ff71607766f5-1
01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:15.053
and couple more people working
in a man walking into his work

01:14:15.053 --> 01:14:18.761
guy on a ladder part, cleaning
the windows. Then there's a

90f599c5-5677-4d86-af63-ff71607766f5-3
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:22.658
little stand where you probably
can buy coffee and stuff that

90f599c5-5677-4d86-af63-ff71607766f5-4
01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:24.669
people are waiting to buy stuff.

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:29.770
stand over there and two little
dogs are saying hi to each other

406c15c4-66e6-441c-bddb-928605126cbb-0
01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:36.106
And there's another little stand
over there. People are ordering

406c15c4-66e6-441c-bddb-928605126cbb-1
01:14:36.106 --> 01:14:37.080
some more stuff.

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:41.160

cover.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:46.348

no good and there's an old woman

c3de17f6-8d1c-4a8d-ac85-ad3e055a1dba-1
01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:49.869
