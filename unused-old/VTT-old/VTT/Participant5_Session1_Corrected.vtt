00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.890
Under a covered bridge, stone
bridge.

e3f34d4d-f50e-47d9-a44d-3374b5d2a58d-0
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.232
Looks like it could be in
Central Park, New York City. The

e3f34d4d-f50e-47d9-a44d-3374b5d2a58d-1
00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:01.300
children are.

85204ce0-0e45-4220-94b0-621c67e8aca5-0
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.170
About 12 years old.

08a5e36d-671c-4842-9fed-9e9db93d1258-0
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.480
They're under the bridge because
it started to snow.

9cb368b4-1c79-497d-bf13-53932986c514-0
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.030
no it started to rain.

ee172c2f-3dee-4708-8455-d36ccd2c6dd1-0
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.380
Umm.

09d4a28d-e0b0-4b8d-b232-106eca217398-0
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.090
It also appears.

30cee3c8-9d84-44a2-9de6-1ef158a59e77-0
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.570
That they might be afraid of
someone or something.

4318a6da-c79e-413c-8668-aee40533df4e-0
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.840
One of the children is looking
at a door.

c9bdf618-e73c-4ed8-a04f-16c4da8cbc4a-0
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.910
Perhaps afraid that someone is
coming through.

60115554-67c3-4e4b-8d59-f908fcc0a1b9-0
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.990
Outside the bridge.

9f916f87-a1bc-4155-8145-521afabc030c-0
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.530
There's a park bench, there's a
street light.

47e4c167-faf7-467e-a61e-40741c8733ac-0
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.420
A can for garbage, and there's
a.

34553056-420f-452c-8442-d372f98015a1-0
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.140
Beautiful statue, 2 statues.

83f8bd8d-d69c-443c-8086-fd768c5e6ad3-0
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.860
Umm.

a2343b5f-93b5-4c2d-9a3d-182d52907068-0
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.930
Of an Angel or two.

ed8b6300-0eac-4949-bd5c-1b6f1323bcb3-0
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.684
There's also two bicycles there.
Or maybe it's looks like it's

ed8b6300-0eac-4949-bd5c-1b6f1323bcb3-1
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.787
one bicycle with two seats.
That's probably how they got

ed8b6300-0eac-4949-bd5c-1b6f1323bcb3-2
00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:11.890
there, and they'll probably
leave when it stops raining.

c539ef34-7362-442f-a8d8-49fd7559f2da-0
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.056
{Whenever you're ready, you can
tell me that turn the page. Is

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:23.370
that about what you want or do
you want less than that? Is that

c539ef34-7362-442f-a8d8-49fd7559f2da-2
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.460
OK? OK, you can turn the page.}

736a845e-b9a6-464c-b25b-3cf5742ccfd4-0
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.220
{Ah.}

249dccea-fae8-43b2-b349-fc961a6c9931-0
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.810
As expected, someone did come
through the door.

4ba308cc-45d6-43ef-ac9f-a2347a614361-0
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.860
Looks like.

597fd81f-d2c5-4a93-96cf-1fe267cea250-0
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.950
It's.

38f3129e-78c6-44d3-8f23-386862fbab42-0
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.570
A medieval king. And he's
holding a piece of paper.

b1eb3d86-3f61-4035-b3ea-ab095160a841-0
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.755
I'm not sure what's on the
paper, but the children look

b1eb3d86-3f61-4035-b3ea-ab095160a841-1
00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:03.330
afraid.

81225553-d2c5-487c-990e-649ce5383f92-0
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.580
There's a.

1087f8ce-624d-4800-994c-d32336ad81b0-0
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.021
Purple bird, large purple bird
with a long tail, a ribbon like

1087f8ce-624d-4800-994c-d32336ad81b0-1
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:16.630
tail.

aa1f077d-1ced-4495-8340-d93150812f52-0
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.538
And the bird is hovering over
them, maybe trying to protect

aa1f077d-1ced-4495-8340-d93150812f52-1
00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:21.880
them.

a30c8749-a27a-46c5-8ca0-f318ca29e2b8-0
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.096
Suddenly the king grabs the one
child and is about to grab the

a30c8749-a27a-46c5-8ca0-f318ca29e2b8-1
00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:29.670
other.

674ab32a-442f-49b3-abeb-c8fb4c5625f2-0
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.120
Oh, the boy grabbed the paper.

e3c13c00-b982-4f40-b57e-0eb932d5decc-0
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.474
But a knight comes out of the
door and grabs the king. So the

e3c13c00-b982-4f40-b57e-0eb932d5decc-1
00:04:38.474 --> 00:04:43.103
children, two knights, come out
and March the king back in the

e3c13c00-b982-4f40-b57e-0eb932d5decc-2
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:46.850
inside behind the door, and the
children are free.

ae4cd110-8925-4b80-85ed-18483a656bf9-0
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.100
{That's it. OK.}

4a789dee-137e-4d33-89a7-aef708c57ce3-0
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.781
The boy has the paper in his
hand and they look, they're like

4a789dee-137e-4d33-89a7-aef708c57ce3-1
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:06.056
they're a little afraid. Still,
he has a little bit of that

4a789dee-137e-4d33-89a7-aef708c57ce3-2
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.200
purple thing.

cf3ce6fd-4f22-431c-82a1-5d5abd1ff8bc-0
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.290
I don't know. Something purple
in his hand.

e1ce0737-2e1b-44cb-9d5e-fd1efd4c7ff0-0
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640
Ohh.

ed79d4d7-d06c-4f31-b958-35c9478da090-0
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.310
The girl. I guess one of those
Childs was a girl.

3b9c71d7-e1c5-4575-958b-b7344a722606-0
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.660
She had some sort of.

8012cdbc-9f8c-497c-9239-467a08e86a1a-0
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.985
band around her and it might
have some kind of bullets in it.

8012cdbc-9f8c-497c-9239-467a08e86a1a-1
00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.190
Maybe that's a large purple
bullet.

25b9e215-71d4-4671-822b-6d195e440360-0
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.740
Any.

889c2f0f-9b29-44a4-ae31-78149a8a1173-0
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.260
It's a key. Perhaps it's a key.

838e8141-1c8d-4694-b332-ff3e4a70029c-0
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.625
Gosh, they're brave. They're
going to open up that door. They

838e8141-1c8d-4694-b332-ff3e4a70029c-1
00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:46.000
open up the door with the keys
and they go on in.

8dbe7189-0e45-47fd-a32a-a93fec37ec93-0
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.430
That's it. Birds following them.

802b9faa-e380-4c65-a25c-03f4e611c222-0
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.260
Ohh.

0e1ff00d-6fe4-4654-b3e9-9b34fb743bef-0
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.490
Oh, I see. So they came.

d616def9-d227-4a6e-afd1-276fa8686c2c-0
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.550
On the other side, they came out
to a beautiful scene.

667803d7-c7c0-4652-bd4f-1f7a95576652-0
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.670
There's a huge castle.

19e91498-c17e-48b3-905b-2d2270a820c9-0
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.754
In the not too far distance some
water between them and the

19e91498-c17e-48b3-905b-2d2270a820c9-1
00:06:13.754 --> 00:06:14.360
castle.

e3f50be4-e61a-44a8-899d-2fdbbd737d7e-0
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.440
There's a waterfall.

1234edb4-4634-43b9-ac3b-81c1019c6be7-0
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.040
Um, they're hiding on a rock.

d9f8fcf7-9f69-4ad0-a907-2a851b810b69-0
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.510
There are some sort of.

57489e8e-20be-4fba-b0bf-e213f0095b29-0
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.120
Vehicles in the sky.

1adf079b-2f2e-421a-bd6f-34d06a782c47-0
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.050
Blimp like vehicles with people
in them.

d7654408-2cb1-455d-ac6b-e4ff01ba39a0-0
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.000
Um, looks like there's smoke
coming from the.

95bd06d8-1a84-4ede-a706-a5a0aa106c2a-0
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.811
Tops of the castle. I'm not sure
if there's a fire and there's a

95bd06d8-1a84-4ede-a706-a5a0aa106c2a-1
00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:51.110
lot of the king is returning.

76765444-447c-4b47-b2a6-219e7e1d48f8-0
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.614
Looks like he's going back
inside the castle. They're

76765444-447c-4b47-b2a6-219e7e1d48f8-1
00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:57.210
watching him. {That's it.}

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.870
So now they've opened that
paper. It was a map.

70f82994-a358-4d74-8a04-c79be11af66e-0
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.970
OK.

e1152793-a1a6-4920-9398-b147b3bc1873-0
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.280
And they're pointing to a spot.

50649ca4-c7d7-49d2-aeea-1cbee2aae70d-0
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.450
On the map.

1aafa8ea-2af9-4930-a4d2-0f50f2749f63-0
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.710
Think they're still on that same
rock? The bird is still there.

bbe009e0-88c8-4752-9219-294bf253b301-0
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.800
Um.

13d4b91a-a460-49ce-bb05-1cd73b621e6e-0
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.210
And a ship is.

81eafb28-ec2b-43c0-a3fa-e25014cf3fd1-0
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.340
Going out under a large bridge.

15f54a06-b9d4-4a89-a01d-245935f16c7c-0
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.840
There's a lot of what appear to
be soldiers on the bridge.

f024fe1e-2440-493e-b9e9-5b13733d4656-0
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.660
I don't think they've seen the
children yet.

f21d75e1-bf76-4648-9411-45300c89cd9f-0
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.350
On the map oh, they're pointing
to.

7c3f94a9-e761-4541-a8b9-395e2dcd17f3-0
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.950


5f109dc9-1e19-461d-bc4f-f5300e40dfcc-0
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.120
I don't know a building with a.

f51b1e6a-1461-4d91-876b-67dc459f66ee-0
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.932
It's like the Acropolis. I
don't. They're pointing to a

f51b1e6a-1461-4d91-876b-67dc459f66ee-1
00:07:55.932 --> 00:08:00.403
building with a triangular roof.
Maybe that's where they want to

f51b1e6a-1461-4d91-876b-67dc459f66ee-2
00:08:00.403 --> 00:08:00.610
go.

c3d47579-8cee-4f27-b4be-b22d87699821-0
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.470
{Next page.}

4734009e-c19a-424a-b8e3-d25724fb1070-0
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.800
OK, well, I think they decide
they want to follow.

c8ac7bd0-99fe-4978-b364-160d1b687f37-0
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.495
The smaller boats. I don't know
where the smaller boats came

c8ac7bd0-99fe-4978-b364-160d1b687f37-1
00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:27.560
from, but somehow they got.

e3897285-1f6a-42a0-b84d-5d44d6837045-0
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.630
Some flippers for their feet.

f6d541d5-6de7-45c0-aebf-cb307e8e1df9-0
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.790
And they.

15830193-9d86-47e6-85e0-c01b3618a943-0
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.417
Dive into the water with the
large purple bird. I don't know

15830193-9d86-47e6-85e0-c01b3618a943-1
00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:42.160
what's going to happen to that
map.

247b3246-6af6-4621-91ba-5dfd9dd9ecbd-0
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.560
{OK, that's it.}

09de8fd1-89f0-4a72-8e44-2dfae6910a2f-0
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.502
OK, Ohh, there's that building.
It looks like the Acropolis and

09de8fd1-89f0-4a72-8e44-2dfae6910a2f-1
00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:58.860
they're underwater.

973a8bc3-d0d7-4a53-9246-6cc1e7d5312d-0
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.150
And they got.

18dbe817-c666-447d-8c62-1a1c242b3167-0
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.232
A system to breathe. I don't
know where they got that, but

18dbe817-c666-447d-8c62-1a1c242b3167-1
00:09:06.232 --> 00:09:09.987
they're all set. They've got,
they're all set. They've got a

18dbe817-c666-447d-8c62-1a1c242b3167-2
00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:13.558
way to breathe. They've got
their flippers and looks like

18dbe817-c666-447d-8c62-1a1c242b3167-3
00:09:13.558 --> 00:09:17.437
that big bird is pulling them
down. Down way below the surface

18dbe817-c666-447d-8c62-1a1c242b3167-4
00:09:17.437 --> 00:09:21.008
to that building that they saw
on the map. There are fish

18dbe817-c666-447d-8c62-1a1c242b3167-5
00:09:21.008 --> 00:09:21.869
flying around.

e569ca39-8b21-47f3-8a3c-ac08938c1f6a-0
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.440
Swimming around and.

804a6009-7c62-4bf7-afac-a5e490f4e64f-0
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.849
I don't know what they're going
to find. {That's about it

804a6009-7c62-4bf7-afac-a5e490f4e64f-1
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:30.230
there.}

22878dc1-4ba5-45a1-a697-96533d4a91e3-0
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.900
So now they've looks like
they're in that building.

e7382ea8-e950-4c9a-a874-02d8dd78b982-0
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.918
And in it they see a beautiful
statue with two with seahorses,

e7382ea8-e950-4c9a-a874-02d8dd78b982-1
00:09:46.918 --> 00:09:51.040
one on each side. It's like
there's a big shell on the top.

d920eda0-540b-40ca-ae1b-a02f5534cbf0-0
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.560
Umm.

37b72b13-5e2a-4dc3-886c-0caeff38f709-0
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.676
And they're reaching for
something in in that shell. I

37b72b13-5e2a-4dc3-886c-0caeff38f709-1
00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:01.504
can't tell if they're reaching
for something or putting it

37b72b13-5e2a-4dc3-886c-0caeff38f709-2
00:10:01.504 --> 00:10:04.380
there, but I think they're
taking something from the shelf.

09240d5d-1c4d-46d7-a3f0-fb42f095f102-0
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.852
But suddenly here comes one of
the soldiers, or several

09240d5d-1c4d-46d7-a3f0-fb42f095f102-1
00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:15.845
soldiers. Six soldiers saw them
and they're chasing them, so off

09240d5d-1c4d-46d7-a3f0-fb42f095f102-2
00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:16.460
they go.

2b599437-8f8a-4e5b-97e2-ceb1e5afa9e3-0
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.340
Holding on to the tail of that
bird.

dcad1878-8f9f-4d45-a792-ca11cf28dce1-0
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.240
They must have escaped because
now I don't see anyone behind

dcad1878-8f9f-4d45-a792-ca11cf28dce1-1
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.560
them and they are coming out of
the water.

b74bad24-c43d-4961-942c-f4bfb8d00f2a-0
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.890
And they found a bit of land.

152f462a-bbeb-488c-af3e-d4c9a775c7ea-0
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.240
Maybe a small island. There's
palm trees.

adacfcec-1939-4898-9801-644afd5fcc87-0
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.638
And they're running. They must
still be afraid. Maybe there is

adacfcec-1939-4898-9801-644afd5fcc87-1
00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:50.310
still someone behind them so
now.

2381db84-7c2f-4868-9a70-8596d1aa987f-0
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.770
I don't know what they're
drawing on, but they're drawing.

de09cd0e-ae04-415e-a1cc-ca688242c195-0
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.544
Oh, with the purple and red pens
that she had with her that I

de09cd0e-ae04-415e-a1cc-ca688242c195-1
00:10:59.544 --> 00:11:02.866
thought were bullets. OK,
they're drawing themselves.

de09cd0e-ae04-415e-a1cc-ca688242c195-2
00:11:02.866 --> 00:11:04.220
Maybe they're drawing.

864cc1d7-84f0-4e33-9631-bb85e91afbb1-0
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.421
Themselves an escape hatch? I
don't know. The bird's still

864cc1d7-84f0-4e33-9631-bb85e91afbb1-1
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.440
there. {That's it.}

cb8945ec-7617-44b6-9c49-608d2661b1a2-0
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.810
Ohh, they drew up through
themselves.

80e2a0ca-1d2c-4d71-8058-5bf99b85ae9d-0
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.170
Some form of escape looks like
a.

92d7f90e-5014-4797-be31-87fd144393f5-0
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.890
Purple rhinoceros and you've got
a really nice.

03b094a2-3513-4c00-9857-7136f3092d8a-0
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.192
Arrangement to sit on the back
of the rhinoceros and they're

03b094a2-3513-4c00-9857-7136f3092d8a-1
00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:36.320
OK, so they're going down a
hill.

a66744e8-956f-4d58-9b26-53da88582063-0
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.170
Through.

6afa414a-5f97-47e6-9cd3-cb00b2f71d55-0
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.565
Another set of statues to
another building that looks more

6afa414a-5f97-47e6-9cd3-cb00b2f71d55-1
00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:44.980
like.

b8bf3dcf-6b0d-4505-bcb0-1d2cb2cb46d7-0
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.644
I don't know, doesn't look like
a castle. It looks no looks

b8bf3dcf-6b0d-4505-bcb0-1d2cb2cb46d7-1
00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:55.750
different. Maybe it is the back
of the castle.

2e074693-3bef-425d-8be7-c4efb52bcb26-0
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.400
Umm.

ba0567d6-a04b-4a8c-8511-c964954b5ed9-0
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.800
In the distance, there's water.

d9e3977e-68c8-4d1e-901c-21da849566b4-0
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.390
Another building with a very
narrow maybe.

e75ed714-91b4-47c7-a51f-66d002299f6f-0
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.848
Suspension bridge with string or
wire or something,{ that's about

e75ed714-91b4-47c7-a51f-66d002299f6f-1
00:12:15.848 --> 00:12:16.120
it.}

817ecfe4-41d3-417b-ba2e-cfc49757300e-0
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.530
Yeah, there it is.

3036d30d-33a9-40c4-b7e8-29ea58907818-0
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.240
They made their way to that.

a5271e85-1117-4a06-bb98-fe92dbe2b3c2-0
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.530
Very dilapidated rope bridge.
And they're going to that, the

a5271e85-1117-4a06-bb98-fe92dbe2b3c2-1
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.256
peak of that other building. I
don't know what they're after,

a5271e85-1117-4a06-bb98-fe92dbe2b3c2-2
00:12:33.256 --> 00:12:36.229
but the bird seems to be leading
them.

18604a20-ab53-486b-bf24-31ab2b936305-0
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:38.990
Umm.

11bddc27-b33c-464d-8258-16a25d654801-0
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.147
They're crossing the water and
they're almost halfway to the

11bddc27-b33c-464d-8258-16a25d654801-1
00:12:45.147 --> 00:12:47.430
top of that other little
building.

3ce6ebf7-860a-4fd0-b966-80de31803e2f-0
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.660
There they are. Now they're on
the top.

5c74b015-fcf9-45b1-b47a-d149947c64e5-0
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.820
The soldiers are pursuing them.

dda03464-87ab-4848-a5f3-a01fe43bc073-0
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.037
So we still got the map. I don't
know how he kept that dry

dda03464-87ab-4848-a5f3-a01fe43bc073-1
00:13:06.037 --> 00:13:07.010
underwater, but.

f0af7242-f55c-4956-9f36-990caef983c7-0
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.703
 they're drawing again. They are
drawing some form of escape.

f0af7242-f55c-4956-9f36-990caef983c7-1
00:13:13.703 --> 00:13:15.970
Maybe those are propellers.

664e8dbf-e909-42c2-863c-3089991c3a56-0
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.579
You're going to, I don't know.
Let's see what they're going to

664e8dbf-e909-42c2-863c-3089991c3a56-1
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:23.300
do. The bird is still there. All
feathers. Maybe. We'll see.

526e8ba7-da22-4b18-96b5-f0e89a01c8fe-0
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:29.480
Oh.

08d98254-6167-4315-8989-731b6418564c-0
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.703
Oh, oh, just in time. Just in
time. They finished drawing a

08d98254-6167-4315-8989-731b6418564c-1
00:13:36.703 --> 00:13:41.963
swing and some extra wings for
the bird and so that the bird

08d98254-6167-4315-8989-731b6418564c-2
00:13:41.963 --> 00:13:47.309
could fly faster and higher. And
they just, just in time they

08d98254-6167-4315-8989-731b6418564c-3
00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:52.569
missed the grasp of the soldiers
that were chasing them. Now

08d98254-6167-4315-8989-731b6418564c-4
00:13:52.569 --> 00:13:55.070
they're off to the mountains.

3ab15371-a22c-450a-b87a-07c266238d30-0
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.280
On the top of the mountain.

6904b8a8-6cce-477f-928e-76b04399922b-0
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.750
There seems to be.

e7bbe5c7-7aee-4ba8-90f2-f84eda8853ba-0
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.940
a Temple.

b428e818-f891-45a0-a0fb-4c20ab851656-0
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.000
Of some sort.

bbaca450-5179-481f-b8b0-c216e0081346-0
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.960
And the bird is dropping them on
the top of it.

1855a4be-09c4-451a-888a-61011a275f81-0
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.150
Soldiers are still pursuing them
in those.

428eab10-f590-4099-b285-269d1a917a95-0
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.140
blimpse. I don't know.

7d91ba9f-cf36-4bf2-ba54-d5639a7b0440-0
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.449
What they're going to do? Ohh
she's still got her crayons, so

7d91ba9f-cf36-4bf2-ba54-d5639a7b0440-1
00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:36.760
they're about to Draw Something
else. I'm sure that's it.

11309a45-5de8-429a-8858-6506df4662a2-0
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.306
Ohh, they are all over and
they're about to get. Grab the

11309a45-5de8-429a-8858-6506df4662a2-1
00:14:45.306 --> 00:14:47.600
bird. Bird has something in its.

544be0a4-7d48-41b5-a38d-840a596f76b0-0
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:49.870
Mouth.

6302e00d-8478-4701-93a4-bdd2de330289-0
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.190
Um.

31693dd3-e399-4ce2-b330-a67e2387f94b-0
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.500
Know where the kids went. The
kids are still there, but.

84ff0649-16e0-44b1-81ec-f7eaa558432d-0
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.226
I don't know what's going on
here. They're about, oh, did

84ff0649-16e0-44b1-81ec-f7eaa558432d-1
00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:05.882
they go off with the bird? I
don't know. They might. They

84ff0649-16e0-44b1-81ec-f7eaa558432d-2
00:15:05.882 --> 00:15:07.440
might be trying to grab the
bird.

812262fe-6691-4ff0-b4d0-c53375620694-0
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.680
{Let's see what happens.}

e9e268ff-5caf-45b6-8d5e-feb59abac332-0
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.100
{I don't know. Is there more?}

de3b8fc9-3571-48cb-9667-32f606449937-0
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.510
{I don't know what else to say
about this thing. Oh.}

98887aeb-4a77-490a-9475-830342bcb72a-0
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.490
{Oh.}

2adde5b2-f790-4791-b982-137d52bdd8e3-0
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.860
The kids are still there.

204520a2-d1d0-48c2-b1e2-c6c1ce377207-0
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.360
The bird.

17580523-1b4f-4680-a9db-657d09c15bf3-0
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.910
Ran off with the crayons.

83000e22-673c-49e7-b484-26da4def7ead-0
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.630
And somehow.

dfa8bfea-2afe-4e87-8db2-596bb580685c-0
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.090
With all those colors made a
beautiful rainbow.

e815d0d9-b620-4d44-84a1-5feb8eff4eb3-0
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.180
And.

3488cd7b-3d1a-4756-a68d-06fef8d2a1a0-0
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.403
All the soldiers look like
they're angry, confused, maybe

3488cd7b-3d1a-4756-a68d-06fef8d2a1a0-1
00:15:51.403 --> 00:15:52.420
even afraid.

a8e93dd2-2b62-4f49-a290-46ba73ea24ad-0
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.360
Of the beauty of the rainbow,
but the kids look happy.

e4f53de3-acba-4f61-9df7-4bbf08b977af-0
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.222
So maybe they're going to well,
{let's see what happens. I don't

e4f53de3-acba-4f61-9df7-4bbf08b977af-1
00:16:02.222 --> 00:16:02.450
know.}

fcc4d7e7-c25d-435e-9955-b28879651d35-0
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.471
{Can you describe a little more
of the scene? Describe more of

fcc4d7e7-c25d-435e-9955-b28879651d35-1
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:14.640
the scene?} There is the water
below still the castle in the.

b8909185-00e6-4a22-bb80-e56d3c642ffe-0
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.060
Distance bar distance surrounded
by water.

2ac0f519-72f9-4ceb-bbfe-151612ef3c8b-0
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.740
{OK.}

de015f93-9b97-42b5-9380-6980240d6919-0
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.630
So they were on the mountain.
The rainbow goes all the way.

df3d6ffd-2782-4b21-827e-4c3701dcff55-0
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.090
Down to a.

cc3a014e-4979-4b41-9a33-8b6bcf7e07e3-0
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.540
A ship.

e7876b18-4c0c-46a7-b012-b3a147c76163-0
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.650
In which the king is standing.

ef65a9ce-b0a0-4508-a657-3a4ab8323caa-0
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.890
And a bunch of.

8d93fe7a-307a-4216-a104-2a2eeab5cb4a-0
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.100
Soldiers are.

868e7cc1-fd6c-492e-8459-c6ced2f5a738-0
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:56.880
are

14d6eee8-e566-446c-8570-c44221650f39-0
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.170
We're sitting, but it looks like
the rainbow has.

f8d9ba9c-c88b-40c2-ad7a-c59a5e152bfc-0
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.230
caused some kind of.

019af302-360c-40f0-a588-7b3124c09261-0
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.120
Problem. And some of the
soldiers are either.

e2abd5bf-f2a1-4c88-ab6f-e54a316bcd9f-0
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.570
They've been knocked into the
water or jumped into the water.

2aea9f35-ec3d-409c-bb37-6acb9bb1bbcf-0
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.570
Um.

ee43a6fa-940f-4e18-866e-0e3bff08dfbc-0
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:24.275
Bird which did which brought
that rainbow down to the boat is

ee43a6fa-940f-4e18-866e-0e3bff08dfbc-1
00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:24.650
now.

8cbbb890-a2b6-43e0-8a94-ca2a5ec34a9d-0
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.900
Taking off, I don't know where.

f066ab1c-3467-40a0-9cae-7448f06f8147-0
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.752
The children are the castles in
the distance right behind the

f066ab1c-3467-40a0-9cae-7448f06f8147-1
00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:34.170
boat.

6adf0a9b-88e3-44fb-ba34-af8aa41c905c-0
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.820
{That's about it. } There's a
nice reflection of the rainbow

6adf0a9b-88e3-44fb-ba34-af8aa41c905c-1
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.690
in the water.

a8f9e342-d6c9-4af7-969b-ee514c005e26-0
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.890
Well, I don't know how they got
there, the kids.

ceaca734-6402-48c4-bbfa-47de45fb3354-0
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.328
I didn't catch that, but
somehow, maybe the kids, I don't

ceaca734-6402-48c4-bbfa-47de45fb3354-1
00:17:54.328 --> 00:17:56.460
know, somehow the kids got.

9ac0181e-d779-411f-b77d-4bfae4b78cd0-0
00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.860
Looks like they're going into
the castle.

0b349fef-e6c9-4767-8832-832998b2128e-0
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.410
In.

9621dbee-5add-4dbe-abb8-9e72bb326485-0
00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.539
Looks like that boat, that same
boat that the king was in. The

9621dbee-5add-4dbe-abb8-9e72bb326485-1
00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:12.927
soldiers are gone. There's a
couple there, but they don't

9621dbee-5add-4dbe-abb8-9e72bb326485-2
00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:16.723
look angry. The kids are on that
purple rhinoceros. Oh, the king

9621dbee-5add-4dbe-abb8-9e72bb326485-3
00:18:16.723 --> 00:18:17.949
is on the rhinoceros.

54c1f150-a348-4cba-9d95-c8698dd73054-0
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.900
Ohh.

5ea20628-0447-4e7d-abdb-31ee3c08e839-0
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.920
Now there's just.

b2f9e779-0f3a-4c2d-b88f-5e89502db5fa-0
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.003
I cannot tell. He looks
victorious. The kids do not look

b2f9e779-0f3a-4c2d-b88f-5e89502db5fa-1
00:18:29.003 --> 00:18:33.836
scared anymore. I don't know.
Somehow the rainbow brought joy

b2f9e779-0f3a-4c2d-b88f-5e89502db5fa-2
00:18:33.836 --> 00:18:34.850
to the world.

a9eda741-5a07-44b8-bf70-9c1d723bcf42-0
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.630
The city is.

62984c12-f487-4b9a-aea3-a002533613f6-0
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.710
Is golden under the rainbow.

a1b53bd7-80e3-49c2-ac2e-4fa6192fc7c2-0
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.100
People seem to be celebrating
oh.

f6c7a3dc-1566-4d78-8e29-df26e5e30b66-0
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.720
that

15250ee6-784e-40bf-b199-16cc8fdb1486-0
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.640
Bird, or whatever it was seems
to be.

577b7c11-a9ee-462b-bf6a-89a82d3b4638-0
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.430
Underwater.

e7ccc0f5-f5a8-4fa1-aaa8-99982ff43f8c-0
00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.012
Parts of it. I can see parts of
it {OK, I I just, I don't. I'm

e7ccc0f5-f5a8-4fa1-aaa8-99982ff43f8c-1
00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:02.290
kind of confused.}

fe9caf20-1b95-4e39-886a-98a60e3eba3e-0
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.050
{There's a lot going on.}

a62b84d4-9603-45cb-bb13-92dc7a36a79c-0
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.110
Well, I don't know why, but the
king is suddenly.

c95d3cbf-d99c-48a7-a7c2-7ff37f60f27f-0
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.880
Not frightening character
anymore. Maybe it must have been

c95d3cbf-d99c-48a7-a7c2-7ff37f60f27f-1
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.470
the rainbow.

c4f3b545-ab5a-44d8-9ecf-f11ff449b0db-0
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.901
He's welcoming them into his
castle. Oh, and now he's looks

c4f3b545-ab5a-44d8-9ecf-f11ff449b0db-1
00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:34.874
like he's helping them depart
because there's a waterfall we

c4f3b545-ab5a-44d8-9ecf-f11ff449b0db-2
00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:39.439
saw at the beginning and the
door they came in through.

5e7678e4-6840-47b7-a7e9-cbb49e833f7b-0
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.440
Um.

76efc152-ebc8-49e3-94b8-3d82a161a42b-0
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.640
And they're going to leave this.

082d621b-a75b-4637-9815-562f7d7beb6f-0
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.080
No, I don't the the bird is
leaving.

2286dbe2-cd2e-43e6-ae63-4609458fdfc5-0
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.780
And Umm.

b243c616-5730-4ab7-a186-4bccc0d145bb-0
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.900
Hmm.

be515b6a-c973-4251-afa9-be564f9d2480-0
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.847
Yes, giving them each a crown or
he he ohh they must have given

be515b6a-c973-4251-afa9-be564f9d2480-1
00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:05.960
him the gold crayon because he
has just drawn them each.

1e81507a-c422-433b-80b0-cb605d767c3b-0
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:11.268
A gold crown and the bird is
still there. Oh, there were two

1e81507a-c422-433b-80b0-cb605d767c3b-1
00:20:11.268 --> 00:20:15.431
purple things. There was. Ohh,
they drew them anyway. OK,

1e81507a-c422-433b-80b0-cb605d767c3b-2
00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:19.020
they're saying goodbye and he's
saying thank you.

465844fa-224f-40a3-a250-4de813d2052f-0
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.121
{That's a bizarre story.} And
off they go. It stopped raining.

465844fa-224f-40a3-a250-4de813d2052f-1
00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:29.910
It looks like. It still looks
like New York City to me.

0ce36059-1f80-4926-a1d3-fc9622af584d-0
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.577

a8530cd8-088c-4acc-91ca-baae5117d4b6-0
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.120
#START_journey We're looking
inside the House of.

0ed21cfb-9390-40b6-afff-252b33c406d2-0
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.860
A young girl.

6fbca9da-bdfa-49a9-b79a-7e9603e9f9fe-0
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:38.163
And it's a cross section of the
house, so we can see her father

6fbca9da-bdfa-49a9-b79a-7e9603e9f9fe-1
00:27:38.163 --> 00:27:43.956
is upstairs working on a letter
or something because her mother

6fbca9da-bdfa-49a9-b79a-7e9603e9f9fe-2
00:27:43.956 --> 00:27:46.310
is in the kitchen cooking.

8ec06f12-55ab-46ac-a23a-015c483b604f-0
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.620
And she's just sitting. You can
also see the basement.

7953e36e-c728-4597-8528-c57146380560-0
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:58.965
You can see the furnace and some
pipes, and you can see that the

7953e36e-c728-4597-8528-c57146380560-1
00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:04.976
pipes go out of that house and
underground and into the next

7953e36e-c728-4597-8528-c57146380560-2
00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:06.060
house. But.

72f224d4-7519-41e5-adff-effa10198e53-0
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.812
Um, it's neat. The house is
neat. Oh, there's another

72f224d4-7519-41e5-adff-effa10198e53-1
00:28:11.812 --> 00:28:16.912
person. There's maybe her sister
sitting on the couch, so they're

72f224d4-7519-41e5-adff-effa10198e53-2
00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:20.930
all in the house. She's sitting
on the front stoop.

3ec0111b-175d-4c86-9d04-977cec416fbd-0
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.780
1234 steps and she has.

17461baa-13d8-447c-b66d-28dce712e3c1-0
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:31.800
She looks sad. or bored. She has
a scooter in front of her. It's

17461baa-13d8-447c-b66d-28dce712e3c1-1
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.190
red.

2f0d7267-3d09-415b-be4a-f8829f6db34a-0
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.360
The rest of the.

eb836728-8c47-4b15-a15e-2d996f4fca1d-0
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.420
Entire picture is very shades of
brown and.

ea199c42-f0ce-4934-b763-fe29e6e24dc2-0
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:48.856
biege So then across the street
from her well, you see, you see

ea199c42-f0ce-4934-b763-fe29e6e24dc2-1
00:28:48.856 --> 00:28:51.440
a fire hydrant and a street.

c7c84853-fa54-4da2-a4e0-7e46177d0aaf-0
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.110
A red light stop light.

00cd59f6-2a12-4195-9d39-632e2ea8a1f1-0
00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.209
And you see another house, but
we can't see inside that house.

00cd59f6-2a12-4195-9d39-632e2ea8a1f1-1
00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:04.981
But we can see a young boy.
Well, there's four young,

00cd59f6-2a12-4195-9d39-632e2ea8a1f1-2
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:09.171
there's four children in front
of the other house. Three of

00cd59f6-2a12-4195-9d39-632e2ea8a1f1-3
00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:09.800
them are.

f107d0ad-6847-458c-aa3b-b47561e5ed52-0
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:17.874
Playing together and one is
standing by himself near a

f107d0ad-6847-458c-aa3b-b47561e5ed52-1
00:29:17.874 --> 00:29:20.320
mailbox and he's got.

ecab0f32-cd93-45a8-9b9b-12a6d17036d3-0
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.270
Red Crayon in his hand looks
like he's thinking about drawing

ecab0f32-cd93-45a8-9b9b-12a6d17036d3-1
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.000
something.

4707b3fb-b75f-4e89-9298-ae76926b42a8-0
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.830
{Yeah.}

a85071b8-209e-4d00-89c0-f6f3d4309edd-0
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.170
{Yes.}

d031daa2-907f-4139-9145-21db972a530a-0
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.170
Well, the girl must have gone
back inside.

73a23fd1-c576-44f2-9f71-075415058f90-0
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.710
Um and.

105fe252-37d3-4632-bad9-e482455bfdcc-0
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.600
Mother is still in the kitchen,
cooking.

b0bcd2de-3ca0-4270-857a-0d6715b92f52-0
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.170
And the mother is also on the
telephone.

cc51c596-313b-4bf3-b775-7e132643c425-0
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.640
The girl.

f70db715-b103-4764-9f02-46cf5286fb83-0
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:03.065
Then goes and talks to her
father, who is still busy

f70db715-b103-4764-9f02-46cf5286fb83-1
00:30:03.065 --> 00:30:09.236
working, but now he's on the
computer. And then she must. Oh,

f70db715-b103-4764-9f02-46cf5286fb83-2
00:30:09.236 --> 00:30:14.910
she left her scooter in the
kitchen. Now she has a kite.

c619da23-35f1-4dcb-b103-f8e9a5fefee9-0
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.600
Umm.

1cfc4f86-2370-4c05-aa96-7fa59b37b533-0
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:22.767
She must have gotten bored with
her father, so she went on to

1cfc4f86-2370-4c05-aa96-7fa59b37b533-1
00:30:22.767 --> 00:30:27.060
see her sister, who is still
sitting on the couch.

2ff61c80-2fc1-42b4-92b4-25ec99e4e1df-0
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.946
And she still has something red
with her, but I'm not sure if

2ff61c80-2fc1-42b4-92b4-25ec99e4e1df-1
00:30:31.946 --> 00:30:32.740
it's the kite.

63aff962-c18e-49f0-88b0-00424bd17888-0
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.010
And then she got bored.

b2936669-dcaf-47b2-83f8-ea390ced6f28-0
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.760
Their sister too, so it looks
like she went into her room.

b2936669-dcaf-47b2-83f8-ea390ced6f28-1
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.210
She's sitting on her bed, looks
very sad, very bored.

a6e08b97-d246-4513-80d1-d48dea5775e7-0
00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.672
The cat is sleeping on the
floor. Near her there's a

a6e08b97-d246-4513-80d1-d48dea5775e7-1
00:30:52.672 --> 00:30:54.470
dresser one window.

5b455255-202e-4362-a827-adb1aa5bef3f-0
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.380
Her doors open.

7ae86a7f-a37e-4e6e-a06d-48c50e4ec329-0
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.890
The cat gets up.

534c2217-8563-4a36-be5b-a64916ff7443-0
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.320
And when the cat gets up.

6500fb6a-d345-46a6-9d65-edd8b0450fb2-0
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:13.920
She sees a red crayon. Now she's
little interested in that, so

6500fb6a-d345-46a6-9d65-edd8b0450fb2-1
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.340
she goes over and picks up the
red crayon.

dee3f455-b61b-45ff-8ea9-94d4bcc1e09e-0
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.980
And starts drawing on the wall.

2158d06e-3c86-40b6-b8af-897aa94eeea5-0
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.390
Well.

088d94a0-afcc-44ce-b156-4dbbd29a69cd-0
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.130
She draws herself a door.

54b5bed9-5469-4a84-a96c-f976c4560a9e-0
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.710
And goes into it.

2faf6d6d-36ce-4b98-9e9d-1df4a9980120-0
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.590
When she comes out the other
side.

3a26f0dd-b850-429f-ac83-75c90dbf0b58-0
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.830
She sees she's in Central Park.

6330d9c3-7ea1-4799-9cfd-c52068b0bc7f-0
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.200
There are.

676f2658-5f88-4624-b244-7791276627d8-0
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.550
There are beautiful.

35bc3fd7-06e2-4535-b2f3-9a2290cf2084-0
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.250
Lanterns hanging from.

544cdb20-3ff7-43fe-8416-421777d2b808-0
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:59.960
The trees and strings of lights
hanging from tree to tree.

eafeea05-3787-4d66-b043-3204ff749f77-0
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.230
The door.

65bd7d99-a36d-4db3-94ee-5a2aa6f10c7d-0
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.988
Opened from the bottom, from the
the bottom of a trunk of a tree,

65bd7d99-a36d-4db3-94ee-5a2aa6f10c7d-1
00:32:09.988 --> 00:32:11.110
and she looks.

370118d7-e5e9-4a8f-bcce-2a4d2aedee8a-0
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.460
alive now, yeah.

7f473d4c-841e-4d46-9383-0cecbade3876-0
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.030
so she walks a little ways.

eafb3c4b-484f-409d-a52e-033c36f04d23-0
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.540
You can still see she's still.
There's still loads of trees and

eafb3c4b-484f-409d-a52e-033c36f04d23-1
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.130
lanterns and lights and it looks
like it's.

e5926248-41c0-484d-9c48-de682bd1821e-0
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.500
Dusk.

e8b5f545-3eab-4c80-b913-93e781df0c77-0
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.780
She finds a little.

fdb67bd1-936b-4968-9d7e-86f15f85f638-0
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.220
Duck and she walks out on the
dock.

8557f7e9-9f66-42a9-998b-6849a7d34f79-0
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.740
There was no boat, so she drew
herself one.

2eb83e23-eb72-4a8e-8afd-e8b007973444-0
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.510
Her red crayon and she got in
it.

cef2f85b-8838-4415-843f-a97a5e19a6ff-0
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.310
And she's floating away.

8670391e-6690-476d-bff9-150963a46df5-0
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.170
Wow.

9dcf425a-a957-4060-becd-ae607e88d342-0
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.470
She has floated all the way back
to the castle.

b3051560-4bf4-440c-b5bf-d9de1192a8ab-0
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:09.140
And she's heading right toward
the castle.

71ddbf11-d3fe-436e-93b0-6d2a62de3a3d-0
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.150
Surrounding the castle is water.

ec0e383b-6170-4e76-b705-61e4fd9c6849-0
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.450
And.

fbcf9559-29a2-441a-8a59-d88161ddedac-0
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:26.643
It's huge castle with 25 towers
and domes of gold and theirs I

fbcf9559-29a2-441a-8a59-d88161ddedac-1
00:33:26.643 --> 00:33:33.230
don't see. Like see just a few
people here and there.

c764d177-981d-4eaf-8f5c-b6a6ab12daea-0
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:39.195
There's a windmill in the
distance and a flag on top of

c764d177-981d-4eaf-8f5c-b6a6ab12daea-1
00:33:39.195 --> 00:33:40.460
some of the towers.

d5b846ce-0205-4c47-b858-af59487f8eaa-0
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.630
{Yeah.}

d48c19e7-76a8-4dfe-8637-8f12e3461d1e-0
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:49.820
{Hmm.}

865f6919-3c51-4b3a-a5d2-d3caa7322cd0-0
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.770
Somehow, her little boat has
made its way.

5d67993e-1098-4007-9c1a-fb765d5b7149-0
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.120
Up in toward the top of the
castle.

e8a674cb-18f1-4b57-a6bb-a33e8cebad29-0
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.180
Now she's greeted by.

9ee28f6c-962b-4b19-a533-3361a3fc9a84-0
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.350
Several.

8d083e50-6256-4626-9d2e-a8e47ae8a070-0
00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:14.830
Soldiers in yellow uniforms, but
they're.

37053164-9b2b-424c-86cd-fed2b95fec9e-0
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.000
Greeting her with waves.

eea4aff6-9783-4461-b0e3-85ff319afa29-0
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:21.280
And.

7f256f16-ed3e-4451-afe3-1415a18bc796-0
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.540
She's still just sitting there
in her boat.

a475a87c-2e16-420f-88d8-47ff2bc57712-0
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.140
Umm.

11b66c74-5e55-4961-8bb8-4f292a3d8396-0
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.630
{I don't know what else to say
about that one.}

e8c8d24e-4e33-428f-8f72-6290061fe62c-0
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.490
{Oh oh so.}

c823a959-a2ad-4fa6-9e86-bb1bd553c75e-0
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.870
Um, she's gotten to the end of
the line.

2f032ef2-8548-4ef4-ac40-36e0811f9ce4-0
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:50.525
And the water that was carrying
her has now, it's now become a

2f032ef2-8548-4ef4-ac40-36e0811f9ce4-1
00:34:50.525 --> 00:34:52.240
waterfall and.

6fdb5fe7-57cb-409e-854d-b11669fc115e-0
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.370
People are staring at her about
and she's.

276b2310-dfc0-40ad-bf50-aa1b1884a6db-0
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:04.816
Wondering what's going to
happen. Clearly she's going to

276b2310-dfc0-40ad-bf50-aa1b1884a6db-1
00:35:04.816 --> 00:35:10.979
go down. Oh, but just in time
she gets her red crayon out and

276b2310-dfc0-40ad-bf50-aa1b1884a6db-2
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:12.570
she draws a big.

5a2feb4b-47cc-480e-bef0-9de1f047163d-0
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.240
Round.

f105a394-dd77-476b-8b6f-9719f9d8bed2-0
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.750
Red something. Maybe a balloon?

185b0760-b27f-450f-9369-1c14e0221d41-0
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.207
Big round, red balloon and a
basket into which she hopped

185b0760-b27f-450f-9369-1c14e0221d41-1
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:29.670
just in time. And she's
floating.

4c843aa8-1bd2-4ae3-bc1d-c4fba5dc05c7-0
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:30.960
Up.

0ae58a71-b0dc-4cb6-81e7-a23b97d06e90-0
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.640
And away.

9e0b2ff8-b324-457c-971c-74d5a55b48be-0
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.250
And not far from her.

dea29620-6eb4-42a5-96fc-51d1c7ed9687-0
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.810
Is a another.

af8e0722-5986-46e1-9e66-60716c6c3b72-0
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:46.480
plane

9aa71c88-fed2-484f-af87-f92f0aa4d228-0
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.160
Um.

19924d46-a661-4ad1-8fe9-34bd24d5eafb-0
00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:57.790
But a very bizarre one. And in
the distance in the clouds I see

19924d46-a661-4ad1-8fe9-34bd24d5eafb-1
00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:02.610
that bird, that purple bird with
long tail.

f45a6756-1a5a-484a-8e80-a1d71f3517d8-0
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.041
There's a weather. There was a
weather vane on that tower.

f45a6756-1a5a-484a-8e80-a1d71f3517d8-1
00:36:07.041 --> 00:36:09.340
{That's if you want to meet and
name things, OK?}

e8034e10-6d12-4e84-87cc-08961e30b5b5-0
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.680
{So.}

8d957054-1866-4dda-9d42-a5aa8e7ef41b-0
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.100
Hmm.

edd21c19-075e-4af1-bf45-b6277538b899-0
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.900
She notices from her basket in
her balloon that.

ed16e40f-4e75-4b9b-8850-293b91388de1-0
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.220
 there's a soldier in one of
those little.

bef07293-57b8-44f5-8089-8c0df907bbec-0
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:31.990
Planes.

ca520b93-d34e-4f7d-8060-47ad1212f658-0
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.000
That is trying to catch that
purple bird.

707da418-4855-47ea-82ba-a52d55716f44-0
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.770
With the long tail.

e50720fc-7905-45c3-94c9-b209d80ba01c-0
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.770
They're pointing at it.

dc27cf1a-55a0-4c19-9f58-c6da40ae9cb1-0
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:49.127
And they're moving in, in that
direction. And one of them has a

dc27cf1a-55a0-4c19-9f58-c6da40ae9cb1-1
00:36:49.127 --> 00:36:53.530
net and it looks like he's about
to put it over the bird.

b38f251f-c970-45ea-bc54-7b22e338545e-0
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.956
It looks like that big plane,
that big plane is the mothership

b38f251f-c970-45ea-bc54-7b22e338545e-1
00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:06.737
and then there are little these
little planes that maybe do the

b38f251f-c970-45ea-bc54-7b22e338545e-2
00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:07.410
work. OK.

faba4186-fd02-4753-ab22-203c0d403949-0
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.460
I don't know what? Oh, there's
the bird. Oh, they did get the

faba4186-fd02-4753-ab22-203c0d403949-1
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:17.800
bird.

8b11c568-3ba7-47bc-94d3-e2b26973566d-0
00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.294
They got the bird and they put
it in some sort of a cage and

8b11c568-3ba7-47bc-94d3-e2b26973566d-1
00:37:25.294 --> 00:37:27.640
took it back to the mothership.

bbb5f6e0-4414-400b-9ef4-ac79b0dcd4a9-0
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.010
And it looks like.

78f1904e-193b-4295-92a4-a3f47da5a04d-0
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.509
Someone is pointing, 2 people
are holding the cage and

78f1904e-193b-4295-92a4-a3f47da5a04d-1
00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:38.850
someone's pointing at it.

bbbbb879-a166-4a22-9374-4cbd07deb6ae-0
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.414
Meanwhile, the girl is still
there in her red balloon, and

bbbbb879-a166-4a22-9374-4cbd07deb6ae-1
00:37:44.414 --> 00:37:49.390
she's moving toward the bird. I
mean, maybe she wants to try.

16e255b9-4f6a-44c6-934f-cf98ff03af39-0
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.600
Yeah.

5f8f47cb-0310-44cb-ae8e-97e5bf68e558-0
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.135
{You know what else to say
there? OK} so she lands her

5f8f47cb-0310-44cb-ae8e-97e5bf68e558-1
00:37:59.135 --> 00:37:59.600
balloon.

f4d4ec47-540d-4443-9fe1-88b154ef54c7-0
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.750
On the mothership and starts
running down a.

20055416-0d42-46a7-9577-2587e1d6cc3f-0
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.030
Little bridge, a little bridge.

ce545664-3b03-4e38-858e-3c90624599ee-0
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.120


1c927f07-19b2-40fd-bf66-7a20eeb84e3c-0
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.385
It's going to try to figure out
a way to climb up because the

1c927f07-19b2-40fd-bf66-7a20eeb84e3c-1
00:38:20.385 --> 00:38:25.192
cage, the soldiers with the cage
and the bird are two levels

1c927f07-19b2-40fd-bf66-7a20eeb84e3c-2
00:38:25.192 --> 00:38:25.979
above her.

802c71f8-e57d-4120-ad27-3bc18068cbad-0
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.676
Oh, there. She found a way.
Looks like there were were

802c71f8-e57d-4120-ad27-3bc18068cbad-1
00:38:32.676 --> 00:38:37.176
ladders. So she climbed that.
She climbed up two levels. Now

802c71f8-e57d-4120-ad27-3bc18068cbad-2
00:38:37.176 --> 00:38:38.430
she's just about.

7f311310-5d55-4ffc-af60-31551478ba12-0
00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.989
To get to the bird. And the
soldiers are not looking,

7f311310-5d55-4ffc-af60-31551478ba12-1
00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:48.736
they're looking the other way
and she's got her red crayon, so

7f311310-5d55-4ffc-af60-31551478ba12-2
00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:50.470
let's see what happens.

b4d632e7-ba29-44ac-8aeb-6ad0c6413548-0
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.790
Oh, they spotted her. They
spotted her but

33dc6a58-1321-488b-9cc1-cb93eeebfcfe-0
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.280
Only after she grabbed the cage
and started running off with it.

6bffd379-d8f7-4657-af33-6636e0dbcb4d-0
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:04.930
She ran.

9629ea2e-c99f-4d89-9a56-7c3b8204fc8a-0
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:11.605
Faster than the soldiers. She
must have run very fast. Yeah,

9629ea2e-c99f-4d89-9a56-7c3b8204fc8a-1
00:39:11.605 --> 00:39:16.710
very fast, because she got to a
spot where she had time to open

9629ea2e-c99f-4d89-9a56-7c3b8204fc8a-2
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:21.655
the cage and release the bird.
Her red crayon is lying there,

9629ea2e-c99f-4d89-9a56-7c3b8204fc8a-3
00:39:21.655 --> 00:39:23.650
and if she's not careful.

c310fe18-65d4-4957-a73e-b15f334ed3b7-0
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:29.650
She might lose it. Oh, you can
see inside that ship now, there

c310fe18-65d4-4957-a73e-b15f334ed3b7-1
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:34.080
are lots of soldiers and they're
all getting kind of worked up.

3105aa39-0cac-4634-9e02-909520f72a69-0
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.180
OK, off goes the bird and let's
see what happens to her. Oh.

f7e95f46-cfd4-4d7f-b7b2-f96f7abb5457-0
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.494
The bird got away, but she did
not. Two soldiers grabbed her

f7e95f46-cfd4-4d7f-b7b2-f96f7abb5457-1
00:39:46.494 --> 00:39:46.750
arm.

23e15874-18ee-424b-8d1d-0e2ac87da9ad-0
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.920
And the crayon has fallen.

d076b9ce-eff3-4a77-8088-d509f16aaa73-0
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.818
fallen it's. I don't know where
it's going, but she is now in

d076b9ce-eff3-4a77-8088-d509f16aaa73-1
00:39:56.818 --> 00:39:57.890
some kind of a.

1c4f57f0-734e-4f0d-8d95-0bba99d88b58-0
00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.930
Cage.

c5ccf369-41ca-421b-9d38-3f0b404d4d3a-0
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.480
And they are turning the wheel.
I don't. They must. I think

c5ccf369-41ca-421b-9d38-3f0b404d4d3a-1
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.880
they're lowering her.

0ed43685-98cf-4296-aa99-320bda8143d6-0
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.870
Ohh, but just in time the bird.

0723a5c0-cc5f-4bf9-93e6-a26d8c606631-0
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.673
Who that she released was able
to grab that Crayon and it

0723a5c0-cc5f-4bf9-93e6-a26d8c606631-1
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:29.650
brings it to her in the in her
cage.

4dee2746-6367-4d05-a054-8b6414bd33bd-0
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.220
So.

dd8e7433-e650-45f9-8c56-ca548c82426e-0
00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:39.783
She released the bird from its
cage. Now the bird is releasing

dd8e7433-e650-45f9-8c56-ca548c82426e-1
00:40:39.783 --> 00:40:44.057
her from her cage. She's out the
birds on her back and she's

dd8e7433-e650-45f9-8c56-ca548c82426e-2
00:40:44.057 --> 00:40:47.280
drawing again. This time she's
drawing a big.

bc81b356-f834-4a91-b0ae-f661b1ef9dba-0
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.150
Red Square. Maybe a door?

d17c96c0-8f40-4f5b-b13a-1f9a6c89d738-0
00:40:55.370 --> 00:41:02.360
Oh no. She drew herself a magic
carpet that flies.

60382b23-54f3-4b95-9ac4-bd5fd570fa70-0
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:08.462
So now she is up in the air, out
of her cage, up in the air above

60382b23-54f3-4b95-9ac4-bd5fd570fa70-1
00:41:08.462 --> 00:41:09.360
the clouds.

35357e8c-fbf5-49cb-9d1d-b351c0e6c599-0
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:16.840
Flying right behind the purple
bird. She's still in the

35357e8c-fbf5-49cb-9d1d-b351c0e6c599-1
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.740
vicinity of the.

082d7d1c-dd5c-43a6-84e6-5213d0c29305-0
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.490
Castle.

31958986-fe6c-4d7d-92af-eaa5c65328dc-0
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:27.432
As you can see people below, you
can still see some towers which

31958986-fe6c-4d7d-92af-eaa5c65328dc-1
00:41:27.432 --> 00:41:28.700
is on her way.

fea4f537-2ba3-4618-80a9-b3e280004102-0
00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:38.870
Now she's left the castle
behind. She's out. It's very

fea4f537-2ba3-4618-80a9-b3e280004102-1
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.910
dark now. You can see thousands
of stars.

be25350e-30cd-4d02-aad1-404822d32845-0
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.820
Beautiful.

7e5c0218-86a8-4638-aff8-d8039d8ba69c-0
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:53.164
Purple sky. You can see the
silhouette of a palm tree, and

7e5c0218-86a8-4638-aff8-d8039d8ba69c-1
00:41:53.164 --> 00:41:58.060
the mountains look blue in the
distance, and they're flying

7e5c0218-86a8-4638-aff8-d8039d8ba69c-2
00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.080
over the water away from the
castle.

cd99d534-5ed9-41b2-92c7-ad6d3c82292c-0
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.893
Back to Central Park? Oh no,
that's a palm tree. No, that's

cd99d534-5ed9-41b2-92c7-ad6d3c82292c-1
00:42:09.893 --> 00:42:11.070
not Central Park.

1d4d1556-7e58-4eeb-a2c3-d924560c524d-0
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.530
Back to the palm tree that she.

b94bf658-8359-4666-b539-7777cb68b136-0
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.710
Back to the door in the tree
that she came out of.

a8164e1b-4161-4d1e-9723-529792a86c25-0
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:25.121
The bird looked sad. Sad to say
goodbye. She leaves her carpet

a8164e1b-4161-4d1e-9723-529792a86c25-1
00:42:25.121 --> 00:42:25.700
behind.

d6472156-a42f-4bf9-adcb-7e25918ff434-0
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.870
And she takes her crayon and she
goes.

322e37a0-a01b-41d9-b0e7-eeb948f44764-0
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.410
Through the door. Oh.

eb17d8e8-d997-4905-bc1d-4c155e632d3b-0
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.414
She invited the bird to come
with her. I think the bird went

eb17d8e8-d997-4905-bc1d-4c155e632d3b-1
00:42:37.414 --> 00:42:39.340
in first and then she went in.

275e6c43-ad41-4379-90c4-829e47448a36-0
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.060
Ohh that was came out of this.

b4c083be-1343-4ee3-bad6-aaa4e32d44f2-0
00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:49.410
Huh.

83f3b3bb-af46-449f-8219-56f2c64870e8-0
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.670
So she's.

55a4115e-c48d-4732-ad01-a207bc93a8ae-0
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.483
Sitting in the back, she's in
the back of an open mail box

55a4115e-c48d-4732-ad01-a207bc93a8ae-1
00:42:58.483 --> 00:43:03.252
with her red crayon, and it
looks like she and the bird just

55a4115e-c48d-4732-ad01-a207bc93a8ae-2
00:43:03.252 --> 00:43:04.660
came out of there.

c63f654b-dc69-4fed-a933-5f242cf61191-0
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:13.936
And the boy who was standing by
himself earlier looks really

c63f654b-dc69-4fed-a933-5f242cf61191-1
00:43:13.936 --> 00:43:17.790
happy. He has a purple crayon,
so he.

fd00fc5c-11cc-4496-a5a6-703e7918f139-0
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.510
May have created that bird.

69849c82-173d-4838-b81a-0634172a4c3f-0
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:29.140
Bird gone back to sit on his
hand, now his shoulder.

101c30cf-fc9b-4d94-8ad5-c6346de97c5e-0
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.380
And.

bb0bf188-50b0-44bd-a59f-713e132533e2-0
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.280
The girl draws herself a red.

14edc029-d809-4509-9e44-66d94c1ac242-0
00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.152
Circle, and the boy draws
himself a purple circle, and

14edc029-d809-4509-9e44-66d94c1ac242-1
00:43:39.152 --> 00:43:43.280
we're going to, I think they're
going to make a bicycle.

ca43c8d4-9238-46b9-a321-c283d0075bc3-0
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.700
And.

c5fe15ed-2a1b-4361-86a7-beb6c6b24078-0
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.000
Now, together, they're driving
off.

65d921a4-bc8b-4943-9890-c6344c5f6486-0
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.010
#END_journey And the bird is
following them.

1d4275a6-17c2-4502-b275-c5e454cc9bc1-0
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:03.008
{Alright, so that's the end of
this item. We can take a 5

1d4275a6-17c2-4502-b275-c5e454cc9bc1-1
00:44:03.008 --> 00:44:08.639
minute break because it's been a
little more than an hour. So OK,

1d4275a6-17c2-4502-b275-c5e454cc9bc1-2
00:44:08.639 --> 00:44:11.369
508 will come back at 5:18, OK.}

67b883b9-889f-465e-92c3-0b0a63818928-0
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.800
{Alright, so then.}

c2c6fe40-ff96-4287-b7db-2865dce04175-0
00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.200
{Next item.}

53d09ab4-4e19-4791-9081-293beebfbe7e-0
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.430
{Is another graphic novel.}

07b9a295-edbd-4b45-aa43-d1c6ed23f258-0
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.560
{It's a different story.}

aeedc8b7-4464-458a-979c-6d4a755a4f3c-0
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:37.233
{Again, this is this the whole
thing, or this is just the start

aeedc8b7-4464-458a-979c-6d4a755a4f3c-1
00:44:37.233 --> 00:44:41.226
of it? This is the start of
another graphic novel. So it

aeedc8b7-4464-458a-979c-6d4a755a4f3c-2
00:44:41.226 --> 00:44:45.429
goes down one side and then it
goes over to the other side,

aeedc8b7-4464-458a-979c-6d4a755a4f3c-3
00:44:45.429 --> 00:44:45.920
right?}

283d3336-47c2-483e-90a1-86c7bcf006e9-0
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.780
{Up to your right, yes.}

8b645a24-d497-4acf-a328-3aefe0196fbf-0
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.070
{Again, take between 10 and 15
minutes. Describe what you see.}

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.680
{And what is happening?}

496cf21c-d229-46a6-87f1-707a7a55c1d0-0
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.980
{This one's a little hard to
see.}

c2003d29-ba69-4a32-bd40-36008caa920c-0
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:08.350
{Right.}

99527326-4b2b-4a45-87bf-dcd50e4658f6-0
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.877
{Yeah. I have to study. I have
to study it a little bit before

99527326-4b2b-4a45-87bf-dcd50e4658f6-1
00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:16.890
I start talking. Is that OK?
Yeah, of course.}

4b9ce0be-cef0-4577-b791-29c33348f88a-0
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:38.180


6f6b8151-d8ce-49d2-a403-096dc7f89f55-0
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.420
{OK.}

6dda2f93-0fbb-4104-9bec-1f88bc0ea118-0
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.330
{Well, I don't quite understand
what's in the first.}

d1863f08-f3d3-4c2d-8eb8-0bb4b5d0b78b-0
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.488
{In the 2nd and 3rd frame. }
#START_arrival-6 But I do see a

d1863f08-f3d3-4c2d-8eb8-0bb4b5d0b78b-1
00:45:59.488 --> 00:46:03.947
a pot in the 1st frame. Then
something is coming into the

d1863f08-f3d3-4c2d-8eb8-0bb4b5d0b78b-2
00:46:03.947 --> 00:46:08.558
pot. It looks like a praying
mantis and it lands on the pot

d1863f08-f3d3-4c2d-8eb8-0bb4b5d0b78b-3
00:46:08.558 --> 00:46:10.250
and goes into the pot.

69944232-de5c-4699-806c-2c6dcee58a78-0
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:16.930
Meanwhile, you can see a
reflection of a man.

da700860-7ac7-4840-8de4-76198e2932ea-0
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.230
Writing a letter.

00049f8e-f1ca-4432-a71b-96ac40334cfc-0
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:26.480
By gaslight maybe or and, or
candlelight and.

f4ee1da0-763d-4b5f-81aa-856da2efe91e-0
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:33.436
He's writing it by dipping his
pen into an ink bottle of ink

f4ee1da0-763d-4b5f-81aa-856da2efe91e-1
00:46:33.436 --> 00:46:38.906
and writing a little bit, so it
must take him a long time, but

f4ee1da0-763d-4b5f-81aa-856da2efe91e-2
00:46:38.906 --> 00:46:42.380
he finishes the letter and he
folds it.

5c5237a0-ab36-4ad4-aa2d-23aca80bae18-0
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.510
And the way he folds it.

43bc648d-fcbb-4c45-b81d-280239ae3a09-0
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.060
He turns it into a.

99e41dde-ca93-4858-b8d0-be2befde428c-0
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.450
Bird.

a23ee42e-4148-4543-be55-101628866e2e-0
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.050
And he puts the bird.

1209ef5c-4006-42fe-a5f3-f2247252a5c7-0
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.670
like an origami bird into an
envelope.

f418c115-2ede-4617-b911-c2560db9c0ec-0
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:59.590
With some money.

1e911f75-b98a-41f4-afee-ab6f3663c133-0
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:08.982
At least $5 and licks the
envelope, seals it, puts a stamp

1e911f75-b98a-41f4-afee-ab6f3663c133-1
00:47:08.982 --> 00:47:10.280
on it and.

ac2713a4-b5eb-4b1d-bd34-1fd28ecde646-0
00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.690
Takes it downstairs.

38ea9a88-df4b-4621-82dd-df6ab2dc68d9-0
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.610
With the.

bd51a463-00a0-4bed-bbd2-b426a619711b-0
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.334
Someone's following him. Some
big fish is following him. When

bd51a463-00a0-4bed-bbd2-b426a619711b-1
00:47:25.334 --> 00:47:29.838
he gets to the bottom of the
stairs, he chats with a woman. I

bd51a463-00a0-4bed-bbd2-b426a619711b-2
00:47:29.838 --> 00:47:34.197
think he's asking where the
mailbox is, and she points over

bd51a463-00a0-4bed-bbd2-b426a619711b-3
00:47:34.197 --> 00:47:38.773
there. She says she's carrying a
basket, so he goes to the box

bd51a463-00a0-4bed-bbd2-b426a619711b-4
00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:40.589
that she pointed out and.

00fd4361-93cf-44d4-a34e-6dcd20cba1b4-0
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.900
Odd looking mailbox, but he.

6aadcd7c-82d4-4f3b-ab1c-46fa13750d7a-0
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.560
Reads, and he decides to put his
letter in there.

b7f44d47-8411-44b7-ad83-02bbc92cd190-0
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.270
And as soon as he does.

e142033c-3da4-4c57-aeae-d8c9cd5e52ab-0
00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:59.239
He looks up. He he looks
startled because the mailbox has

e142033c-3da4-4c57-aeae-d8c9cd5e52ab-1
00:47:59.239 --> 00:48:01.260
gone up in the air.

4de7aa2c-6f09-4eed-a54f-ca5d070c297e-0
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:04.770
And he turns around.

4991c124-7ec3-4abe-a3b5-afdc660338cc-0
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.180
And walked home.

4d0d18f6-fd83-4fae-9d79-8b75567d528d-0
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:09.040
With.

108d4544-5afa-4df4-8894-0360e981677c-0
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:14.160
Fish by his side, meanwhile, all
the.

8ce9b92c-3f8f-41db-90d7-74324e79dd63-0
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:21.620
What sort of appear to be trees
are actually big leaves.

73d729af-a7de-43cd-bd31-88e84f5c8a61-0
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.020
{Yeah.}

dc691680-858c-4777-9435-be132308655d-0
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:27.810
{All right.}

e7cd7cac-743c-4683-bf39-fdd954722653-0
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.490
Now.

6342374b-089c-4822-a8f1-129840fee3c1-0
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:37.170
We're going to see one of those
leaves or trees.

a8195cd4-41f4-46ac-8dd5-1c01ad7c2386-0
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.887
A little more closely, one of
them starts to split down the

a8195cd4-41f4-46ac-8dd5-1c01ad7c2386-1
00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:43.460
middle.

eab57d70-b616-460f-bf7e-44178c698582-0
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.040
And splits more.

46c830ca-84da-4026-b54b-91449c7b2093-0
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.870
Until the.

a05a532b-b706-4c9d-bf64-53da7abc9bef-0
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:56.480
Both half of the leaves fall
away and all that remains is the

a05a532b-b706-4c9d-bf64-53da7abc9bef-1
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.340
stem and.

8971e370-fb59-4a15-81db-513f79bec4f5-0
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.220
A tiny little flower.

a51ff8d2-8a4a-47f9-b0ba-7545e3fb443d-0
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.782
And you get a closer. Look at
the flower or the flower starts

a51ff8d2-8a4a-47f9-b0ba-7545e3fb443d-1
00:49:08.782 --> 00:49:09.700

the flower seems to be changing.

00:49:41.485 --> 00:49:45.614
First it's just getting bigger,
but then it's getting darker and

A little boat and a statue and
maybe some tiny trees. There may

pot from the beginning, and now

Outside the window you can see
he someone has hung some clothes

00:53:22.814 --> 00:53:27.188
to dry out. On the clothesline I
could see the clothes pins. I

00:53:27.188 --> 00:53:31.354
think they're outside, some of
them are inside. He also has

00:53:31.354 --> 00:53:35.660
lines hanging inside where he's
hung his pants and his socks.

He's sitting on the edge of his
bed. His shoes are on the side

earlier is.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:15.320
A lot of notes, letters.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.164
There are some objects that are
the same shape as the ones that

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.810
Next to him on the bed fish or
frog?

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.970
Suddenly it jumps.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:42.935
It jumps into a kind of a hatch
with a ladder and he he he's

c70161ff-3cde-451b-b18b-a2b9c611c5e2-1
00:54:42.935 --> 00:54:47.692
looking to see where it went and
decides to follow it. He goes

c70161ff-3cde-451b-b18b-a2b9c611c5e2-2
00:54:47.692 --> 00:54:48.900
down the ladder.

202071dc-9521-4cca-9dc0-72cf2184eab6-0
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:54.744
Oh, there is his letter, the
fish found his letter. He opens

202071dc-9521-4cca-9dc0-72cf2184eab6-1
00:54:54.744 --> 00:55:00.141
it up and there's the bird that
he folded the other day and he's

202071dc-9521-4cca-9dc0-72cf2184eab6-2
00:55:00.141 --> 00:55:01.470
smiling because.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.120
I'm not sure why, but he's
looking out the window.

a7d6226b-eba7-48de-81c0-952925f381e8-0
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.260
Hmm. It's no longer a bird,
it's.

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.740
Looks like the praying mantis.

objects.}

00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:00.353
Piece of paper that's been
folded to look. To me it looks

3cdc3a7a-2abb-47d6-b640-104bf9920ed0-1
00:56:00.353 --> 00:56:00.700

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:06.356
It's an insect. {Now, am I
supposed to go down or over for

5559da12-b008-42ac-89cb-74b3293457a1-1
00:56:06.356 --> 00:56:11.220
this page or just describe each
object, right? Yeah, OK.}

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:15.210
{OK. So I'll go across, alright,
OK.}

9fef731a-06bf-4442-bae3-3af54a23bc9e-0
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.510
{So now I see.}

21a547f9-9cc0-4407-9b2f-ffad0b5eed93-0
00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:26.330
triang looks like a triangular
shaped.

dda9fffb-e87f-461b-a669-c0941cd93f88-0
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:33.797
Container with a hole in the
front. Through that hole I can

dda9fffb-e87f-461b-a669-c0941cd93f88-1
00:56:33.797 --> 00:56:38.010
see what appeared to be some
beautiful plates.

281e8633-6207-4a73-9c4f-6fc23779f19b-0
00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:48.690
Next to that is a hat and a
scarf hanging on.

057b930e-1fc8-45b7-9727-4cc9181f1a94-0
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:50.190
Hooks.

cbcf7550-ff33-4ad1-96dd-0252f7b353fd-0
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:52.260
On the wall.

4829568b-20de-4dc3-a99c-edf01d6a6946-0
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:58.380
Below that and to the left is a
bowl.

168dd632-ca39-4cbc-9da3-f294deb39dea-0

123.

52ad90fc-2f5d-4bae-ac4d-96be75a9b8df-0
00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:18.470
Objects with they look like
maybe horns, maybe horns of a

52ad90fc-2f5d-4bae-ac4d-96be75a9b8df-1
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.890

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.920
And then something that looks
like a white.

2b18fb1d-06e4-475b-bb34-7efbaff386cb-0
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:30.633
Pine cone and behind it is an
egg standing on its end, and in

2b18fb1d-06e4-475b-bb34-7efbaff386cb-1
00:57:30.633 --> 00:57:35.550
front of that bull appears to be
a very odd.

03f93f1e-afca-480b-9f81-0e2fa8b73460-0
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:41.670
Fork. Long Black, unusual fork.

ad6403aa-b27f-400a-8ebc-994b51dd673b-0
00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.140
The picture next to that is
someone's drawing.

b792ccfb-9b0c-452c-b16f-ffc672b8fb74-0
00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.980
Drawing of that.

48b0ef9e-4709-4b3f-9d49-6953680596a6-0
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:55.000
And it's a drawing of a to me.
It looks like a boat.

c1b9e9b4-bcd9-412f-86a7-7fe9fa8ce531-0
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:59.180
{Sorry.}

6b205442-d584-4383-a3dc-78a00e5b7e6f-0
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:05.460
{Oh, where'd you go?}

589f2042-e333-49f2-b903-0f31b72bc292-0
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.610
{Are you still there? OK, good.
OK.}

70f7a4ff-8312-443e-8ee1-4f5fe44ad410-0
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.320
{Sorry about that. I better turn
that off.}

9cfdee57-31a6-490e-ae28-fe23faa23ad5-0
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:19.470
{Where was I? Oh yeah, } the
drawing of I think it's a boat

9cfdee57-31a6-490e-ae28-fe23faa23ad5-1
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.490
almost looks like a submarine.

e2b24b28-dae3-4452-ab43-cb4a8bbee226-0
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:23.860
Umm.

34afc0b9-9f1e-419c-9eea-54df3b9b1b6b-0
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.850
But there's like steam coming
out of the top. I don't know.

c47bae82-2041-4954-8b98-2b7152ae684d-0
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.491
Yeah, a ship. A steamship maybe,
but the wheels in the wrong

c47bae82-2041-4954-8b98-2b7152ae684d-1
00:58:34.491 --> 00:58:35.020
place.

5512e002-40f8-4880-9425-d13ccfb42de6-0
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:39.456
Wheels also got to be somewhere
else, so that's why I don't know

5512e002-40f8-4880-9425-d13ccfb42de6-1
00:58:39.456 --> 00:58:41.490
if it's a ship or a airplane,
but anyway.

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-0
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:47.126
{If I looked at that upside
down, if we look any better,}

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-1
00:58:47.126 --> 00:58:51.082
the clouds, it's upside down
because the clouds are below

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-2
00:58:51.082 --> 00:58:55.038
them. That's got to be an
airplane, OK, because there are

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-3
00:58:55.038 --> 00:58:59.540
clouds below that, below the the
boat. So it's got to be a plane.

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-4
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:03.906
That's a plane and it's flying
by steam and there's another one

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-5
00:59:03.906 --> 00:59:07.862
in the distance. {OK, that's
enough of that one. Oh, good

c759edd7-4486-446c-abcf-db3270586637-6
00:59:07.862 --> 00:59:08.340
grief.}

2527687e-1ac7-4e79-a137-791fe5ba0fef-0
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:14.096
Looks like an oil can. An oil
can, and next to it is some kind

2527687e-1ac7-4e79-a137-791fe5ba0fef-1
00:59:14.096 --> 00:59:16.700
of a little now maybe another
oil can.

37339ebd-2d8b-45a4-9357-bb9f8fd68234-0
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:21.760
One of them has a small hose at
the top, the other has a key.

e2c26122-bb12-4f7e-b9ca-a0f0d6d61565-0
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:24.910
This next one is a cup.

bab44fc2-d04a-4bed-aead-385779f38b23-0
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.255
And a saucer, but instead of
having, instead of having a a

bab44fc2-d04a-4bed-aead-385779f38b23-1
00:59:30.255 --> 00:59:30.710
handle.

6147681e-19dd-45e3-8a4b-2b03fcda6f9b-0
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.300
It is as if the handle.

1298c684-e864-4d13-8f20-5932cc3e9241-0
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.629
Broke and it's just went out
straight. There's no it's a very

1298c684-e864-4d13-8f20-5932cc3e9241-1
00:59:41.629 --> 00:59:46.030
unusual handle. It's straight
and it's sitting on.

aa52b956-a4ec-4dc0-9088-2468737d28db-0
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:50.390
A piece of fabric.

0664621a-5381-408e-abef-fce25bc92e1f-0
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.230
Next to that is a portrait of.

2cb1dbe2-34a2-4f36-9c4b-dde2dd28b54c-0
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.910
What appears to be a father, a
mother and a daughter.

b420ab53-49df-4abe-aa35-0b820b55a7ae-0
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:06.010
From about the 1940s next to
that is.

9f30c291-7629-4aca-8420-389502ab8425-0
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:12.758
Of an adult hand putting a coin
into the open hand of what

9f30c291-7629-4aca-8420-389502ab8425-1
01:00:12.758 --> 01:00:14.760
appears to be a child.

94021de3-8668-483b-acd1-32cb1f143a2e-0
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.000
Near them is.

744f8645-d8c6-4b7c-b6ae-7d4f3330bec3-0
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:19.980
That's cup and saucer.

7f273272-6ad6-4815-8870-93cbb0608b33-0
01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.800
{Hmm. That's it, right? These
are bizarre, yeah.}

a9383f55-63b8-4983-aee1-58d57e1a86ed-0
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:32.960
Ohh.

76797fae-3ed6-425b-8a0f-e62618ffd6f9-0
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:43.170
This is a family. They look
happy.

effb0b5f-b542-4783-98ac-75ea2fad8f84-0
01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.040
I see that.

ec708706-1c9e-4fac-9406-6e79f90effc6-0
01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.801
Triangular container with the
plates in it that I saw earlier.

ec708706-1c9e-4fac-9406-6e79f90effc6-1
01:00:50.801 --> 01:00:53.300
I see that same portrait up on
the mantle.

8556771c-a0fa-4278-881a-628eac0375d9-0
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.970
I see the.

a0883247-52fe-4896-a5b7-7f9e81b3a980-0
01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.818
Folded piece of paper that
looked like an insect. I see all

a0883247-52fe-4896-a5b7-7f9e81b3a980-1
01:00:59.818 --> 01:01:02.430
those things. I see that shelf
or that.

65ffc5a2-96c0-40f3-9410-a2040e5278e8-0
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:07.432
The the hat and the scarf
hanging from the hooks on the

65ffc5a2-96c0-40f3-9410-a2040e5278e8-1
01:01:07.432 --> 01:01:07.740
wall.

f50c7a0f-4cf2-43e3-af94-52d945c5849d-0
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.152
I see what appeared to be,
though. I called them the like

f50c7a0f-4cf2-43e3-af94-52d945c5849d-1
01:01:15.152 --> 01:01:19.287
the horns of an animal. I see
one of them anyway. I see that

f50c7a0f-4cf2-43e3-af94-52d945c5849d-2
01:01:19.287 --> 01:01:23.083
fish or frog on the floor,
looking up at the girl. They

f50c7a0f-4cf2-43e3-af94-52d945c5849d-3
01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:25.050
look quite happy, the family.

2ebe383a-a1ce-441a-8069-89d2b1d034b5-0
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:31.759
The father smiling, the mother
smiling. I imagine the girl is

2ebe383a-a1ce-441a-8069-89d2b1d034b5-1
01:01:31.759 --> 01:01:35.010
smiling. Father's holding up
three fingers.

e0986c59-1017-4a78-94ec-1ecdd99ecd33-0
01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.010
And there's a.

cc261688-0f4b-4083-a837-9f0617620c9d-0
01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:44.885
I don't know, maybe some kind of
food in front of the mother with

cc261688-0f4b-4083-a837-9f0617620c9d-1
01:01:44.885 --> 01:01:45.270
three?

44e22e5c-2279-4ac0-bdbd-a0e2ad6ab089-0
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.950
Things coming out of it {and
that's about it.}

4cced030-2fa6-4a2e-af7d-ed283143b37d-0
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.673
{Oh, and the next page?}
Someone's putting on their

4cced030-2fa6-4a2e-af7d-ed283143b37d-1
01:01:57.673 --> 01:01:57.970
boots.

7e2b6537-65e2-4cd2-b09f-2c8317733ef3-0
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.510
{Is this a continuation of the
same story?}

e57c20a6-407a-4703-a65d-63f47f325911-0
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.165
OK, looks like the little girl
is decided to put on her boots,

e57c20a6-407a-4703-a65d-63f47f325911-1
01:02:09.165 --> 01:02:13.360
her rub her boots and her hat.
She's grabbed her hat. On it

e57c20a6-407a-4703-a65d-63f47f325911-2
01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:13.710
goes.

4b82fb8c-9a80-4aa9-a355-dfeffa3bae6a-0
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.040
And she starts running with that
fish

7b3528e3-2650-4623-995f-e1a251c3906b-0
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.520
And they go outside and they run
down the stairs.

c600de5c-5b8e-4c64-96bd-d58842328b9d-0
01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:30.666
Lots of stairs, 20 stone stairs.
It's a beautiful place, and the

c600de5c-5b8e-4c64-96bd-d58842328b9d-1
01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:33.550
trees there look like leaves
again.

c6656755-f9eb-4dff-b717-8813b1849aee-0
01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:41.640
And they run down the stairs
outside and they see some.

e80e2977-b5a1-42aa-91fc-ca9b3eebdf82-0
01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:48.237
Lights, little lights in the
grass and they pick them up and

e80e2977-b5a1-42aa-91fc-ca9b3eebdf82-1
01:02:48.237 --> 01:02:49.800
they become bigger.

7d24b635-0642-4415-aab8-196465f3eb54-0
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.741
And one of them. So she's almost
holding it in her hand. Maybe

7d24b635-0642-4415-aab8-196465f3eb54-1
01:02:54.741 --> 01:02:55.000
it's.

89f0d8db-b520-4efb-b329-d884cbd58634-0
01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.610
#END_arrival-6 Going away? { I
don't know. Yeah, it's bizarre.}

2dc40e27-099c-44bd-b515-01b97d5abd23-0
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.710
{Alright, so that was that

fighting going on, a couple of

29a58ac3-e737-4f22-83e4-c044bf73e6aa-1
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.190
fights going on, one man running
away. There's more men than

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:19.066
Next to the bar is the hotel,
and it looks like you can see in

22f9e29e-0ccd-48f3-890f-83e343cf30e0-1
01:05:19.066 --> 01:05:20.360
the hotel. Oh the.

Fire departments there, because
it looks like there's some kind

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:29.683

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.650
There's a train. Let's go over
to the train.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.264
Not much going on around the
train. There's a stagecoach. Oh,

e8a2b353-606e-4f1c-9e6f-67b6dcd1e8e3-1
01:06:05.264 --> 01:06:08.160
a Stagecoach. A lot of people
are on the Stagecoach. Maybe

e8a2b353-606e-4f1c-9e6f-67b6dcd1e8e3-2
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.057
they're changing the wheel or
something. They might have a

e8a2b353-606e-4f1c-9e6f-67b6dcd1e8e3-3
01:06:11.057 --> 01:06:14.199
problem with one of the wheels.
A lot of these men have scarves

e8a2b353-606e-4f1c-9e6f-67b6dcd1e8e3-4
01:06:14.199 --> 01:06:16.360
around their faces. They're on
their necks.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.954
On top of the stage approach is
a bunch of luggage. Somebody's

c2754db2-eb7d-4354-a37a-0ea3e74aa73c-1
01:06:21.954 --> 01:06:24.340

going out.

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:30.330
There's a bank, says it's a
bank. Not much going on there.

roof are some 1 2 3 men. And

Well, I thought they were
repairing the ceiling, but the

f3e0be49-4988-41e1-a4f9-3e43e22d2f11-1
01:06:49.036 --> 01:06:49.800

01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:56.025
Being silly, four or five men up
there. One has a bottle of

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:01.684
Doing something to the chimney
and the other is on his hands

a8bfceb8-fd7f-423c-a31e-8fa137113776-1
01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.720
and knees, so I don't. I don't
think they're working. I thought

a8bfceb8-fd7f-423c-a31e-8fa137113776-2
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.804
they were working. 1 looks like
he's about ready to fall off and

a8bfceb8-fd7f-423c-a31e-8fa137113776-3
01:07:07.804 --> 01:07:09.940
the other looks like he's ready
to jump off.

a502906a-9c5e-4ec1-9edc-b565ccf7dcc6-0
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:14.580
OK. Oh.

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:39.940
At least they're doing something
constructive.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.371

There's a cactus way over on the
right and meaningless. Oh, and

767e09f8-9092-46d0-9838-b153169404ff-1
01:08:01.402 --> 01:08:04.970

what they're doing, mean, you
might think they're doctors, but

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:32.708

a lot of doctors with all these

01:09:03.283 --> 01:09:07.060
is it gonna go on? It will be a
few more pages.}

88e65950-f89e-4a04-a49a-9c5006c8baab-0
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:12.850
{OK, let me study it a little
bit. Take your time.}

e972dcf7-169d-4a48-a206-62bf9420c6b7-0
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.270
{What's going on here?}

15fe761e-e6f9-49e9-8d2d-c6c936a71b3e-0
01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:33.873
{I don't know, I'll just give
this a go. Yeah, go ahead.}

15fe761e-e6f9-49e9-8d2d-c6c936a71b3e-1
01:09:33.873 --> 01:09:35.960
#START_arrival-5 OK. This looks
like.

34b71af5-9d16-4326-b9c2-0946a4bc63ee-0
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:45.430
Buildings look ordinary at the
bottom, but at the top.

9ddfcae3-3501-47ff-8c63-e40fafaebc59-0
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.890
They are a bunch of.

d8925388-d76c-4086-97e2-f643e061e20d-0
01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.160
So on the roofs are a bunch of.

acd2ef77-fb77-451b-9a0e-7b654b10f93a-0
01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:03.106
Owls. I don't know if they're
what they're made of. They could

acd2ef77-fb77-451b-9a0e-7b654b10f93a-1
01:10:03.106 --> 01:10:03.300
be.

010024e5-4fb2-465a-ae07-4df6a2bb6cc4-0
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:12.475
But it just looked like a bunch
of owls on the roof. At least

010024e5-4fb2-465a-ae07-4df6a2bb6cc4-1
01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:13.740
245678 of them.

f9efc6f3-e223-43d5-ad4f-d0ff4e64c1ac-0
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.280
Umm.

9c31d526-f525-438c-8486-a5c42ef58837-0
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:20.960
And I don't see any people, but
they appear to be.

4d73f95d-694f-4bfc-a1eb-4ba3867b4143-0
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:27.030
Lots of birds coming out of the
tops of the owls.

1079b975-e775-44d8-a522-2b7ae8e519cf-0
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:31.750
{Um, now?}

ab89fdf5-4993-42ec-9afa-59e5e228efb0-0
01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.690
Maybe inside?

ab4f9282-0685-48d6-9943-5133ae5b330b-0
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:41.360
One of those buildings, perhaps
a man, is tying a rope.

f589c78b-f1fb-4133-9c69-569cc02e2490-0
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.610
Around a small.

c09bda4d-b11a-4a93-959e-1988ce213b31-0
01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.080
triangular shaped.

b66faafe-0e60-42bb-9d02-fe4cd1c580d9-0
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:55.300
Vessel with a top that looks
like a cat.

40825b83-3421-4a7f-bc7a-3ad7f087aaa7-0
01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:57.320
And.

a250a199-034c-4ae3-9072-21ea886ce6b6-0
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:02.490
I'm not sure what he did with
it. {Do I go across, then

a250a199-034c-4ae3-9072-21ea886ce6b6-1
01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:03.450
across? Right?}

50f5d932-6277-405e-b8a0-b38cc92ed023-0
01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.173
But, but then then you see the
man. I don't know what he's done

50f5d932-6277-405e-b8a0-b38cc92ed023-1
01:11:09.173 --> 01:11:10.550
with that triangular.

da6b57f4-3905-473b-a06c-8ace1443e340-0
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:13.290
thing that, he tied the rope
around, but now he's got a.

b0400803-2346-427f-aa25-68000f1e0b53-0
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:14.890
Umm.

6fe34b93-7832-4c01-bf89-414e87aaa20a-0
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.530


60c163f2-b5f9-400b-a34c-f56dd6282b33-0
01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.090
Bowl in his hand and he's
talking to a man.

0abd07b3-ded7-4853-9406-ae7ff3a0ab5a-0
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.620
Pointing me saying this way over
there.

f99c8064-7a9d-477c-9533-b634f05f3eda-0
01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.530
And.

cf029001-db80-4a11-a97d-b18517fc115d-0
01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:35.460
I don't think.

17915f8a-0146-4220-a04f-b9fdbee34593-0
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:40.724
The man. I don't know where the
man went, but somehow the the

17915f8a-0146-4220-a04f-b9fdbee34593-1
01:11:40.724 --> 01:11:45.240
man with the bowl gave the bowl
to a young boy. So now the boy.

96dde306-8142-474a-b98a-ae8447a856df-0
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:48.842
Has the bowl and he's about to
go up the stairs and behind him

96dde306-8142-474a-b98a-ae8447a856df-1
01:11:48.842 --> 01:11:49.200
is that.

a4994a46-d372-49f0-b05d-71f58678161f-0
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.590
White fish and.

07069f3d-6927-4800-a3f0-b54264ec198c-0
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:57.160
And another odd character.

7d2327ad-9f78-4be3-945b-f49b620e726d-0
01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.210


3b541cdd-6835-4c05-9de9-3d9323e65b0f-0
01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:03.670
Characters so the boy brings the
bowl to his mother.

84cca487-c9aa-4db1-af39-b616ff8d0968-0
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:06.600
And she looks thrilled it's got.

f7986a93-6019-408f-8582-e758572c2a17-0
01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.300
Unusual.

2e3a09d2-c0a9-47f9-894c-f203b92f4311-0
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.400
Fruits or vegetables in it, and
she.

4fcee058-bae0-4453-9954-c99a72893869-0
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.690
{That's not the same person and
then.}

735a6738-93a2-4cea-960f-72b01e4ce02c-0
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:20.050
{This is so confusing.}

d45f0664-580e-4300-be7e-df0cbf029533-0
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:25.746
And now you see a picture of
that boy, grown up, giving the

d45f0664-580e-4300-be7e-df0cbf029533-1
01:12:25.746 --> 01:12:28.320
same bowl to his mother when
she's older.

d0684254-f245-46ad-8492-ec7792fb1180-0
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:31.150
And now you see.

bcbee55f-8af6-446b-80d1-7454b9b43155-0
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.640
{I forgot what you see.} See two
boys.

a8f2aa75-d7b7-4ed5-b8ad-1e0921310677-0
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:38.090
Maybe brothers?

c1c1f6d4-4576-4eed-997d-6a43cec5e586-0
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:43.770
And the mother, the mother
saying, come on in.

0fdd93c5-6784-4c3f-9a8b-cf52fc7482a5-0
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:51.500
And so they share four of them
now, four of them sharing a

0fdd93c5-6784-4c3f-9a8b-cf52fc7482a5-1
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.130
glass of something to drink and.

686aadb9-5a35-4963-812f-d8acff4c760e-0
01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.890
Cheering the unusual fruits and
vegetables.

ae1a652b-0a4a-4ba5-9ceb-4572ca4d3858-0
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.180
Slicing them.

cd3668f1-4700-4779-a36b-5492798e2780-0
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.090
And putting them in a in that.

ad6639e7-00aa-418f-b0bb-e4323d261916-0
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:15.940
And in that unusual vessel and.

7d2b8a73-f4d6-452c-9f55-1aabfb09effa-0
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.180
{I don't know, this is just
weird.}

47bd5695-63f3-4985-ba00-12542da95521-0
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.250
{It's a different world, kind of
painful.}

4456f2ed-8a35-4bd7-85bb-9e88204f2d2b-0
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:28.370
{OK, I don't know. I can't
really see the last one because

4456f2ed-8a35-4bd7-85bb-9e88204f2d2b-1
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:31.931
it's behind you, behind your
image, but} there's a bowl and

4456f2ed-8a35-4bd7-85bb-9e88204f2d2b-2
01:13:31.931 --> 01:13:35.669
he's got his hands on it. {Oh,
so they're, they're holding the

4456f2ed-8a35-4bd7-85bb-9e88204f2d2b-3
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:38.280
oh, this is whole new one now
you gave me.}

a5d6eb79-9a0e-4efc-91ef-97a932161e33-0
01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.230
OK, these are the four people
sharing.

f4bb4111-8317-40ba-8e06-e4b41fdc3d79-0
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.090
The drink together.

8382c0d4-492c-4bd7-ab03-99f6cdc2c1ad-0
01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.160
Umm.

5bfee508-61e2-42a7-9ce7-6e6d46f439ab-0
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:57.830
And the odd little white fish
and the other darker character.

0f0aa71b-e19a-451f-8d6f-5c71685680c4-0
01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:03.650
On the floor, the boys offering
them something to eat.

bbfc2981-2dc6-499f-b16c-73c287a6689f-0
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:12.190
The man has a torch and he's
lighting.

354066f4-3bc2-4ba5-ad52-1d1bd7b27adc-0
01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.030
One of the.

289b8ee6-c9aa-4b3a-9b7d-efcd07860ee0-0
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:17.320
He's lighting something, yeah.

3c8afbef-233e-4638-81d1-ec4945fb3c26-0
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:19.000
And the.

2995bef8-c6e4-4032-8342-daf62004a534-0
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.120
Other two people are chatting
while they're eating.

073eb75d-8450-4163-a47a-33cc5797ebc7-0
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:26.240
Umm.

d2a7d820-e426-446b-a56e-c43c1ae51539-0
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.199
This fellow has glasses and
suspenders and he looks very

d2a7d820-e426-446b-a56e-c43c1ae51539-1
01:14:32.199 --> 01:14:32.610
happy.

07ad9d62-8863-4693-948f-d7ec00d0a0c1-0
01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:35.600
The woman next to him has.

22411987-4190-4125-b525-cc9ad4550ba2-0
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:39.879
Big smile. She's laughing. She
looks very happy. She's got

22411987-4190-4125-b525-cc9ad4550ba2-1
01:14:39.879 --> 01:14:43.268
fruit in front of her and
something to drink and he had

22411987-4190-4125-b525-cc9ad4550ba2-2
01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:44.660
something to drink too.

41a69020-7ea8-4d7a-afaf-65caa163dd69-0
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.122
I don't know who this other
person is. Maybe his brother. He

41a69020-7ea8-4d7a-afaf-65caa163dd69-1
01:14:51.122 --> 01:14:55.765
has a vest. He's got a very
unusual fork. Happy, everybody's

41a69020-7ea8-4d7a-afaf-65caa163dd69-2
01:14:55.765 --> 01:15:00.027
happy. And now we're playing
instruments. Looks like an

41a69020-7ea8-4d7a-afaf-65caa163dd69-3
01:15:00.027 --> 01:15:04.290
accordion, unusual accordion.
And the woman is playing.

aecc90bc-b32d-4a76-942f-596606a74be8-0
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:07.910
An unusual flute.

87e884b3-dd34-4c20-a430-9a85da217814-0
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.550
and the little boy.

46100683-6b97-470c-a5c3-e26f811e1005-0
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.730
Playing in unusual banjo.

3ff5b877-532a-49ef-814d-39b0505297e8-0
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:21.741
And now it's time to get some
paper and do some paper folding.

3ff5b877-532a-49ef-814d-39b0505297e8-1
01:15:21.741 --> 01:15:22.000
So.

af2144cb-420d-4112-9bde-a048710919d4-0
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:26.477
That's Big Brother. The Big
Brother takes a piece of paper

af2144cb-420d-4112-9bde-a048710919d4-1
01:15:26.477 --> 01:15:29.710
and folds a cat. Oh, that cat
looks that looks like a cat that

af2144cb-420d-4112-9bde-a048710919d4-2
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:30.840
looks like that black.

feb843c6-68bc-4ff5-8a66-1877c99ab842-0
01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:35.016
Thing that was on the floor and
the boy says, well that's great.

feb843c6-68bc-4ff5-8a66-1877c99ab842-1
01:15:35.016 --> 01:15:38.278
And meanwhile the boy is wearing
somebody's hat. No, I don't

feb843c6-68bc-4ff5-8a66-1877c99ab842-2
01:15:38.278 --> 01:15:40.150
remember where that hat came
from.

4268e337-203e-4ef1-801c-aeaa4ea22e1c-0
01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.400
 he says thank you that's
beautiful. And.

79f1129b-93cb-4c9e-91ca-db0a1f049c57-0
01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:49.750
Then the other brother goes to
get something.

9310d441-6ca9-4a42-af1a-dd270ae312a0-0
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:52.810
Out of the cupboard, he gets
that little.

89420639-dc67-4a6a-afc7-97a2cc5de5a9-0
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:58.213
That little pot and together he
and that's the father. The

89420639-dc67-4a6a-afc7-97a2cc5de5a9-1
01:15:58.213 --> 01:16:03.076
father and the mother hold that
pot and smile. And now we're

89420639-dc67-4a6a-afc7-97a2cc5de5a9-2
01:16:03.076 --> 01:16:07.620
looking at a close up of that
pot in the father's hands.

caccdd8c-b356-4fb0-b5fe-332eb1e7e07b-0
01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:10.980
All right.

927133e7-e26b-458c-83d8-1f48ce9fb069-0
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.180
There's the pot.

97ec356e-8cb5-41ae-9b6b-2fa6deac0f77-0
01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:15.920
And.

d9ea1763-7fe6-4b8d-985b-b7d8a93ffefb-0
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.410
It looks like it's getting
smaller.

23418b25-51a8-412f-b645-c455eabc375b-0
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.990
{Probably not what's really
happening on the?}

0055e4e9-b32a-46fb-8185-300ca9c42e11-0
01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:36.360
The boy wakes up and it looks
like he's getting older.

562ec5b6-2630-463a-b6b2-172b795c59d1-0
01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:40.010
And the fish comes.

5b158c28-2083-437c-883e-074cc6c48810-0
01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:43.680
And he pets the fish, and then
he.

29c459d8-b9fb-435f-aaa9-08f41709bb3a-0
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.200
Puts on his shirt, he's
buttoning his shirt and he's

29c459d8-b9fb-435f-aaa9-08f41709bb3a-1
01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:48.690
cutting.

54b7d22d-8ec2-40db-8cd1-4c5f96ec8be7-0
01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.260
A fruit or vegetable and giving
some to the fish.

a86263c7-eba2-4eb8-8e7e-2d7cc4859f5a-0
01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.049
Now that he's all dressed and
sitting at the table, and then

a86263c7-eba2-4eb8-8e7e-2d7cc4859f5a-1
01:16:58.049 --> 01:17:00.580
he puts on his vest and then he
puts on his jacket.

adc3d5ec-49a2-4608-8b13-d9a01337bb7c-0
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:05.697
And then he looks, and the fish
is brought in his hat. He says

adc3d5ec-49a2-4608-8b13-d9a01337bb7c-1
01:17:05.697 --> 01:17:06.400
thank you.

b815b167-d5fa-47ad-9b0a-eec649b43d11-0
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:13.160
{Yeah. So that's that part of
the story. Nice. That's it,

b815b167-d5fa-47ad-9b0a-eec649b43d11-1
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:13.720
yeah.}

0114b240-f105-4eb4-9ecc-01b2215295bc-0
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.670
{Same story, new story.}

e3c5f572-85a4-4715-b071-e4941bafd042-0
01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.420
{In part, in part yes.}

5347ec52-21d0-4c66-a79d-6fd86266413a-0
01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:27.560
OK, we're out in the middle of a
town square.

0be8480e-b5c5-4bc1-93ab-b1b1359c820f-0
01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.580
And.

c53563df-ec12-4395-9b3a-3300feca0dca-0
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:37.446
Looks like almost everyone has a
hat. Yeah, this town square and

c53563df-ec12-4395-9b3a-3300feca0dca-1
01:17:37.446 --> 01:17:40.120
couple people are carrying.

eeee109f-734c-48ca-ac64-e638b1757f96-0
01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.223
Bags. Some people have unusual
things on their head. I see one

eeee109f-734c-48ca-ac64-e638b1757f96-1
01:17:46.223 --> 01:17:47.300
person with a.

0dd4d60f-c9c7-4d6c-b604-e293fb7b99b9-0
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.380
Bowl on his head and someone
else with a bird on his head.

f7592b46-b20e-49b0-a08c-639c92413a62-0
01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:59.626
There are banners in the air
hanging from, I don't know,

f7592b46-b20e-49b0-a08c-639c92413a62-1
01:17:59.626 --> 01:18:02.130
maybe building to building.

1da1b92a-33e1-4b97-aa4f-5c2c3031e40a-0
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.210
Umm.

8ff6ab5b-2e32-4fcf-ad1a-74be1d6bf81c-0
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.140
There are two men with.

0be20ae7-f880-4fd3-934e-888a9fb2377e-0
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.670
Big sticks and.

f3f9353b-bd2f-40d4-aa8b-a14d14b60f91-0
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:18.291
Perhaps they're fighting and
there's a man now he doesn't

f3f9353b-bd2f-40d4-aa8b-a14d14b60f91-1
01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:19.210
seem to fit.

07ddea2b-8063-428b-a1a1-cc39c3533d3a-0
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.270
See, that's yeah. Yeah, he has
some.

0531695a-fd17-43b5-a374-2f7a5e6223f9-0
01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:28.969
Mexican hat and a big basket.
And he's like, he's wanting to

0531695a-fd17-43b5-a374-2f7a5e6223f9-1
01:18:28.969 --> 01:18:34.627
feed some unusual creatures. And
then there's all these women all

0531695a-fd17-43b5-a374-2f7a5e6223f9-2
01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:37.800
have hats too. One has a helmet
and.

14e0c2db-7f06-46c0-9441-8b8c7f3d5a0c-0
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:40.820
They are women that.

e713204f-d295-4391-ba89-d5f82fa8741b-0
01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:48.410
But they all have hats and they
seem to be exchanging.

be732cff-78d4-47ae-91e7-2b3ee3da957f-0
01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:53.355
Money or something. Somebody's
buying something, but I don't

be732cff-78d4-47ae-91e7-2b3ee3da957f-1
01:18:53.355 --> 01:18:55.550
know what another man is
crafting.

8720d90e-2445-4eb4-ae38-2875e8028d49-0
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:58.600
Plate or bowl?

dfd61f6f-0e7d-45a0-854a-676c2d9e5797-0
01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.410
I think it's spinning. Maybe
he's working on it.

80dc774b-e43e-45a7-9643-9b04cf1ae2bd-0
01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.440
Another man is.

fc3c53bd-19f1-4b37-a893-5c44b77729f6-0
01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:12.315
Painting on a wall. He's up on a
ladder painting. And this woman

fc3c53bd-19f1-4b37-a893-5c44b77729f6-1
01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:12.570
is.

e5d5f36e-71ab-4c37-9c1e-5fdae528d964-0
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:20.390
She has a small wagon in which
she has something I.

32d42f42-b9ab-45bc-8998-e8e4a52712f3-0
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.295
Want to say she's selling
something, but I can't see what

32d42f42-b9ab-45bc-8998-e8e4a52712f3-1
01:19:24.295 --> 01:19:24.630
it is.

b23f164c-12da-4bad-8504-163cdce3e071-0
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:26.660
Umm.

1d4751ba-bd2b-4bfb-b164-89666d3a6d9d-0
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.080
Top of the next page there's a.

d254db3b-fcbf-4c14-b682-816f7fe9a1b2-0
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.130
Someone who's come to the door.

5d65f7bf-d8c6-453f-97c1-970156b401c2-0
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:40.416
And he may be. Perhaps he wants
to sell something. And the other

5d65f7bf-d8c6-453f-97c1-970156b401c2-1
01:19:40.416 --> 01:19:44.720
man, he's holding up a bowl and
he has a hat on and it looks

5d65f7bf-d8c6-453f-97c1-970156b401c2-2
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.459
like he's saying no, no thank
you, I don't want any.

bc214467-a83a-4933-8526-04979d8c4f70-0
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:52.100
Ohh and then the man.

a7b9bbb2-907b-4939-abae-b8f0ba499cc4-0
01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.560
Go somewhere else and.

c30ea53f-2b28-473b-a6fd-faab793f8241-0
01:19:57.730 --> 01:20:00.660
And maybe he's trying to sell
something.

24ce65ae-bd7f-4667-8a8e-6b118d40a686-0
01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:02.260
And the man?

25f0a6c0-cddd-4010-bf1e-9385361a28a6-0
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:07.051
Says again. Everybody has hats,
don't they? The man, I was gonna

25f0a6c0-cddd-4010-bf1e-9385361a28a6-1
01:20:07.051 --> 01:20:10.855
say. The man with the hat, but
they both have that. The man

25f0a6c0-cddd-4010-bf1e-9385361a28a6-2
01:20:10.855 --> 01:20:14.660
with the glasses who's sitting
down says no, thank you. I I

25f0a6c0-cddd-4010-bf1e-9385361a28a6-3
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.450
don't need any. I don't want
any. And then.

47c37bf6-febc-44c0-a460-3a1b9eb3c15b-0
01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:23.574
Perhaps it's the same man or
another man. He goes into a

47c37bf6-febc-44c0-a460-3a1b9eb3c15b-1
01:20:23.574 --> 01:20:28.168
store, there's a counter and a
woman behind it, and lots of

47c37bf6-febc-44c0-a460-3a1b9eb3c15b-2
01:20:28.168 --> 01:20:32.838
pottery behind her, and it seems
like he's either asking her

47c37bf6-febc-44c0-a460-3a1b9eb3c15b-3
01:20:32.838 --> 01:20:34.370
something or trying.

7f60efab-136c-4ebd-9d5e-f2cf0e761cd1-0
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:40.830
Sell her something and she says
no. Everybody saying no, no, no.

4b567c6d-6677-42c9-a134-67f6dfe01ec3-0
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.935
There seem to be little
creatures watching them from

4b567c6d-6677-42c9-a134-67f6dfe01ec3-1
01:20:47.935 --> 01:20:52.250
their 4 4 little pots. OK, and
the next one there's.

92c6fef5-11d7-43e5-98db-edab96f5c377-0
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.990
Some kind of big.

83e20586-d717-4458-968e-adb082e071b1-0
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:58.950
Ship with a propeller and.

32695867-b841-4edd-bfa4-30e130189dbd-0
01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:04.823

01:21:04.823 --> 01:21:09.671
men down below, perhaps working
on something else. Big bridge

32695867-b841-4edd-bfa4-30e130189dbd-2
01:21:09.671 --> 01:21:10.610
behind them.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:26.945
{Yep, welcome crew. Like this
will be the last item we do

again. I'll tell you when it's 5

what you see in this picture.
What is happening?}

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.510
{OK.}

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.900

01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:51.562
Cross section of the ocean. So
we're seeing under the water and

597783d7-2d60-4a39-ad5a-5be6e4822b8f-1
01:21:51.562 --> 01:21:55.100
we're seeing on the water and
we're seeing above the water.

3a642c1d-d437-4830-ba4b-f076c928b1a4-0
01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:00.120

bottom of the ocean and rocks

df6b0bd5-5f71-416b-b810-48291e4866b6-1
01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.200

01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:48.205
It's a good chance that he's
going to swallow the boat rather

52020aa6-7489-4121-a267-9499cc33f78a-1
