fa7318cc-bf86-4358-aace-2a0929cd9599-0
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.030
Maybe getting ready for work?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.420
Looking at the map to see where
is he going.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.400
Probably early in the morning or
in the afternoon.

9a0f91de-1139-46cb-bf54-8da049d48f96-0
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.740
Animal or creature looking at
him.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.153
He's being followed by the
creature on the City Street to

b73979b7-e8a2-4eb0-84d7-1a9ab01548ec-1
00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:31.510

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.390
And the city looks pretty big.

c9358fb2-29b3-4815-8ff4-1cc8c7718944-0
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.560
It's cloudy and all different
types of building structures.

d60201d4-b1f3-42ff-8b99-c52094475464-0
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.270
I think there's a railroad
track.

af1d821a-958a-469f-bad6-d60b32aa2886-0
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.640
If you start looking at the map.

a8aaa1a9-0c20-4329-9d3b-b3a28016dba9-0
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.510
He might be lost.

a1ecea88-e36e-4c19-a981-cd02293c8b9b-0
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.130
Teepee cones.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.540
There's a lot of people outside.

8cb21cda-33b0-4153-b6e7-1203282b2ac2-0
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.822
Doing different things, just lot
of different creatures and

8cb21cda-33b0-4153-b6e7-1203282b2ac2-1
00:02:26.822 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.870
Different types of structures.

14eee84c-7834-4afd-acf4-cd7ed1713915-0
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.800
Stuff in the sky.

a7c765d7-a4a2-482f-aa51-5677813884cc-0
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.680
OK.

931f7f64-eb5e-49ac-9047-83d4e0692cd3-0
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.913
The creature is talking to
another. Yeah, I guess the

931f7f64-eb5e-49ac-9047-83d4e0692cd3-1
00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.640
creature animals communicating
another animal.

e3d6fde9-b4a1-40a5-b497-a8874ba52cfa-0
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.164
I guess she's asked another
person with a map asking her for

e3d6fde9-b4a1-40a5-b497-a8874ba52cfa-1
00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:57.160
directions because he's kind of
lost.

9d2368c4-f69c-4fdb-822b-7540f83e7340-0
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.140
He's having a conversation with
the lady.

c973218b-d55c-436c-9a04-f46f96b02e67-0
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.619
Guess she's showing something,
showing him where they go on the

c973218b-d55c-436c-9a04-f46f96b02e67-1
00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.860
map.

d84d75e4-bf56-4cf3-8677-6198fed708f3-0
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.840
And then she's.

38140b3b-5f8c-4c80-ae6e-09cb8df46f72-0
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.997
Shown to some type of, I don't
know, telephone booth or

38140b3b-5f8c-4c80-ae6e-09cb8df46f72-1
00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:17.420
something. I don't know what it
is.

b2dcc127-944e-474d-ad55-94699e5710aa-0
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.720
And she dial something.

55922b32-5890-43f7-8139-92dff499d302-0
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.240
She dial some numbers with her
fingers, then she pull a lever.

79ad70d0-1a51-42b1-8034-ecf31feed5f2-0
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.050
I think it's strange machine.

fc5d2c63-0a26-4a7c-96c4-a817e3d91e07-0
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.390
Things a piece of note comes
out.

1cc4648c-2021-4c53-a147-5e5061967483-0
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.708
And she tells him what it is.
Then after that she hands it to

1cc4648c-2021-4c53-a147-5e5061967483-1
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:40.960

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.690
Then.

a0a1479d-fad7-4802-8a11-a0a26f7d33ed-0
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.930
They talk some more. Let's see.

2806f2c3-c91a-4157-a6fe-b5ca2bbe89f8-0
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.320
She tells him the certain amount
of time he has.

1c9db3e8-d7c0-4f92-ac20-d872915067b5-0
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.610
Then after that.

7face39b-0222-467d-b687-40d51bbdcfb4-0
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.463
They're looking to this guy, I
guess they see sky boats or

7face39b-0222-467d-b687-40d51bbdcfb4-1
00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:03.880
something like that. There's a
lot of people around.

84a453ca-0f9a-4e98-9761-e4a3bdb5ea8f-0
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.362
Some of these people standing
around waiting for this boat, I

84a453ca-0f9a-4e98-9761-e4a3bdb5ea8f-1
00:04:08.362 --> 00:04:10.810
guess it's coming close, people
getting on the boat.

1485c3e2-a343-4a6b-8500-b10444f3237f-0
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.120
The boat.

8dc91e6f-8d05-470a-92be-c9808b5f1eff-0
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.276

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.190
The ticket master.

ffa70c17-a8d7-4e05-892b-39dca6638433-0
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.059
Clicks his ticket and says
walking aboard. He looks yeah,

ffa70c17-a8d7-4e05-892b-39dca6638433-1
00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:34.113
funny outfit on. Get some glass
sunglasses on with the big white

ffa70c17-a8d7-4e05-892b-39dca6638433-2
00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:34.580
beard.

aa66758e-286e-420e-9d81-1b0dd1f3c751-0
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.160
Directing people around them.

af634b36-77a0-4aad-8d13-b34f4285b205-0
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.110
On the boat

8bdef9fc-9ed7-426b-860c-d1edf30e3ad7-0
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.950
Yes, the guys on the boat, the
creature sits with them.

5a22469c-454d-4a79-8a04-35ac9577dce1-0
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.890
Talking to the lady, that helps
him.

82301a8b-3db1-45c0-986d-957a8e6b0d1a-0
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.810
There's other passengers around
look kind of sad.

c7089a07-2884-498d-a5f0-6b0a5e8728e2-0
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.709
She he looks kind of strange.
Confused. Yes. He goes in his

c7089a07-2884-498d-a5f0-6b0a5e8728e2-1
00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:14.750
pocket. His jacket pocket. To
show her something.

4bc4a60b-bd39-4417-9f72-b03b4b58b2b6-0
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.600
That he's looking for somebody.

c0e6eb27-b579-42ce-bb10-7639a78650c8-0
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.840
And she said she has her bird
with him. I guess they

662e38f9-6d90-49aa-a8f8-9973b4f464e3-0
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.620
Both.

dd16776a-1142-41e0-85ea-b432d797230a-0
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.870
Have the same picture of the
same person.

4cf96ab1-dcd4-4cd8-94d4-ec204120e60b-0
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.840

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.930
Then this there's a picture of a
person that's probably Asian.

c5a95c0a-8a5f-4243-96e4-910b87e3763e-0
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.780
And there's a little girl with a
book.

5ffa06a9-e44b-484c-8db9-21e34ee8b3e6-0
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.220
She's reading it. Someone takes
it from her.

90169a1e-57b8-42ae-ba89-b2bbdbae8053-0
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.000
Put it in the drawer.

d01060af-0e71-44a7-a13b-cdb88fa56cf2-0
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.136
I don't know, you've locked you
locked the door, or she's

d01060af-0e71-44a7-a13b-cdb88fa56cf2-1
00:05:57.136 --> 00:06:01.263
getting locked up around.
Somebody forced to shovel in her

d01060af-0e71-44a7-a13b-cdb88fa56cf2-2
00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:05.390
hand says go dig this cold
inside this machine. Looks very

d01060af-0e71-44a7-a13b-cdb88fa56cf2-3
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.370
hot and dirty.

5988fbb9-8445-45a3-938b-bc9632b0214c-0
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.310
So.

9534765c-a0da-4a74-a376-1b3cce1fe7f0-0
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.520
I just, I kind of like slave
labor.

6047b0d7-8fb8-46f3-90c9-6398afc3e664-0
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.160
She's doing her job.

26d7c5b8-88f3-48d8-a7f2-90704f829ecf-0
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.370
Well, if she's hot or whatever.

be01ec8f-e772-47d6-b7fd-c5245aaafb28-0
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.440
And she's climbing on. It's dark
and.

c0218ac9-4f70-4a2a-8c5c-602ec1da80e2-0
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.072
She's trying to like a chimney
sweeper and cleaning the top of

c0218ac9-4f70-4a2a-8c5c-602ec1da80e2-1
00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:28.700
chimney.
