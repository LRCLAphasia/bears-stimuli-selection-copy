00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.740
As a reminder.

00319dd2-1573-48d3-ab92-9aeec7d29dc5-0
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.994
With a complex scene, please
describe what is happening and

00319dd2-1573-48d3-ab92-9aeec7d29dc5-1
00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:16.499
what you see thorugh as
thoroughly as you can take

00319dd2-1573-48d3-ab92-9aeec7d29dc5-2
00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.486
between 3:00 to 3:00 and five
minutes. You can start when

00319dd2-1573-48d3-ab92-9aeec7d29dc5-3
00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:21.380
you're ready.

f49542e1-8788-4681-b42f-a87be0c9a103-0
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.457
#START_escape_from_the_zoo OK,
so in this scene, this is

f49542e1-8788-4681-b42f-a87be0c9a103-1
00:00:28.457 --> 00:00:33.610
another it's very similar to
where's Waldo? But it's not a

f49542e1-8788-4681-b42f-a87be0c9a103-2
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.675
where's Waldo. It's called
escape from the zoo, and there

f49542e1-8788-4681-b42f-a87be0c9a103-3
00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:44.351
are 10 Penguins in this picture
as well. This particular picture

f49542e1-8788-4681-b42f-a87be0c9a103-4
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:46.360
takes place at the zoo.

8ffa2bd4-5163-4a65-b45c-2ff8469f6331-0
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.640
We see in the top right we see
two buildings. One is like the

8ffa2bd4-5163-4a65-b45c-2ff8469f6331-1
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.833
gift shop and the other is a
little cafe. We see also at the

8ffa2bd4-5163-4a65-b45c-2ff8469f6331-2
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:09.380
top an area of rocks and water
that it looks like there's polar

8ffa2bd4-5163-4a65-b45c-2ff8469f6331-3
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.630
bears in. That's like the polar
bear exhibit. We see

c2a0783b-b987-4c48-926b-7d1fd2ddcfb3-0
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.150
an area behind somewhat
partitioned off by glass, where

c2a0783b-b987-4c48-926b-7d1fd2ddcfb3-1
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.587
they have elephants in the
center. So just like when you if

c2a0783b-b987-4c48-926b-7d1fd2ddcfb3-2
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:31.393
you were to enter into the zoo,
you would hit the two buildings,

c2a0783b-b987-4c48-926b-7d1fd2ddcfb3-3
00:01:31.393 --> 00:01:36.052
the gift shop in the cafe, and
then on the other side of those

c2a0783b-b987-4c48-926b-7d1fd2ddcfb3-4
00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:38.639
buildings is kind of like a
little

6b737739-2785-4a4f-a146-c36cbd50bdd0-0
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.000
cemented off area that does have
a center part.

ca68f4f7-bbc5-4f34-b6a4-efd160539e5a-0
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.615
It's it's got water and it's
white, so I would imagine it's

ca68f4f7-bbc5-4f34-b6a4-efd160539e5a-1
00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:54.960
some kind of a cold

171be973-065a-4747-998c-cf8d1f6db5cf-0
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.666
area. And I don't know, I don't
know what normally would be in

171be973-065a-4747-998c-cf8d1f6db5cf-1
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:04.414
there there. I can't see any
animals in that particular

171be973-065a-4747-998c-cf8d1f6db5cf-2
00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:08.229
exhibit, so it's possible that
the animals have escaped.

e18f4b55-9aa0-4b0f-9bbd-0926d7b834fb-0
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.301
There is also, just outside the
gift shop, a large ice cream

e18f4b55-9aa0-4b0f-9bbd-0926d7b834fb-1
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.432
cone that is actually like a
little ice cream stand. So it's

e18f4b55-9aa0-4b0f-9bbd-0926d7b834fb-2
00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:22.427
in the shape of an ice cream
cone. It's got pink ice cream

e18f4b55-9aa0-4b0f-9bbd-0926d7b834fb-3
00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:26.491
and it says ice cream on the
top, and there's a man serving

e18f4b55-9aa0-4b0f-9bbd-0926d7b834fb-4
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.200
like soft serve ice cream out of
there.

59b903f8-f885-4c9a-b105-f940498479e6-0
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.395
We've got next to the gift shop
some. There's like a partitioned

59b903f8-f885-4c9a-b105-f940498479e6-1
00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:41.172
off exhibit that looks like
there's gorillas. There's a

59b903f8-f885-4c9a-b105-f940498479e6-2
00:02:41.172 --> 00:02:46.717
bunch of gorillas sitting on top
of rocks and on a hill a little

59b903f8-f885-4c9a-b105-f940498479e6-3
00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:51.580
bit further down we see a couple
of giraffes and some...

f36b8c62-74e3-4cfc-bfab-f68793dc0539-0
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.584
I don't know what those are.
Maybe like an anteater and some

f36b8c62-74e3-4cfc-bfab-f68793dc0539-1
00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:00.120
rams.

540bc618-1ac6-4a86-982a-51d1461d2c73-0
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.221
And then on the opposite side,
on the left side is another

540bc618-1ac6-4a86-982a-51d1461d2c73-1
00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:12.147
exhibit. We've got a little bit
of grass and some water. We see

540bc618-1ac6-4a86-982a-51d1461d2c73-2
00:03:12.147 --> 00:03:14.610
hippopotamus, flamingos, zebras.

29918da3-7817-418e-ba15-9f8e9baf12de-0
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.401
And then at the bottom of the
screen there is an area where we

29918da3-7817-418e-ba15-9f8e9baf12de-1
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:25.772
see probably like a lion and a
cougar. So some of those those

29918da3-7817-418e-ba15-9f8e9baf12de-2
00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:26.900
cats are kind of

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-0
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.981
in another exhibit. That center
part, when you come off from the

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-1
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.420
gift shop in the cafe leads,
they're just different walkways

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-2
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.351
and they lead through the
through the zoo and that is

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-3
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:45.936
where it is very crowded with
lots of people and there's a lot

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-4
00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:50.449
of activities going on. There's
a looks like a guy with a hot

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-5
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.452
dog stand, there's adults,
there's children, there's a

c10678a5-9874-4e39-b0b2-a12f6a4a4508-6
00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:57.000
random peacock that is posing
with

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-0
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.351
For a picture, there is, it
looks like some zookeepers that

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-1
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:06.288
are up in that one center
exhibit where there's no

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-2
00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:10.765
animals. They've got a net and
they're looks like they're

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-3
00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:15.782
looking for for the animals that
might have escaped. We do see a

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-4
00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:20.568
kangaroo hopping around in the
middle of the people. We see a

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-5
00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:25.199
couple of raccoons that are
sitting perched on a tree limb.

60b1bf7c-a072-4323-9cdc-d901863468b1-6
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.670
There is a, I guess a rhinoceros

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-0
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.506
that it looks like has escaped
from somewhere and it is headed

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-1
00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:36.503
down one of the walkways. And
the people that are in front and

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-2
00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:39.992
to the sides are basically
running, arms outstretched,

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-3
00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:43.734
mouths wide open, kind of
dashing to get out of the way of

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-4
00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:47.858
this rhinoceros, which is such a
large animal. And it looks like

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-5
00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:51.727
it's running down the walkway.
So people are kind of jumping

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-6
00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:55.597
over the the railings, kind of
hanging on to the railings to

092f9fd0-f8ba-4f29-9937-7d325ffa64d7-7
00:04:55.597 --> 00:04:59.149
try to get out of the walkway.

Umm.

16ad25bb-e00b-4350-8f17-e0f8b6ed5e38-0
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.810
I feel like I'm there something
big that I'm missing. Sometimes

16ad25bb-e00b-4350-8f17-e0f8b6ed5e38-1
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.840
I have to move the

5013dcb8-d63f-4a17-86ad-072d5fc537b8-0
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.350
screen around.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.450
Yeah, we think, I think you
could. Is that good? OK.

f4390806-3691-4666-b7f6-947e0c5ed0a4-0
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.294
Right. So next item is also a
complex scene. OK Ohh, sorry, I

f4390806-3691-4666-b7f6-947e0c5ed0a4-1
00:05:26.294 --> 00:05:29.650
think you're fine for it. There
it is.

6c12fce0-3feb-42c3-9add-7c6fa5ec6eca-0
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.450
Oh, OK, alright, so this.

f86f5ddc-5bc5-4ecb-88b2-0fce7ae157f1-0
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.013
This may actually be it. Is this
a? Is this is a? Where's Waldo?

f86f5ddc-5bc5-4ecb-88b2-0fce7ae157f1-1
00:05:45.013 --> 00:05:46.630
This is really tiny.

c43eeb4c-0fd8-4d4b-9f1e-37012b7019b6-0
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.170
Yeah, this is OK. So this is a
where's Waldo?

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-0
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.197
#START_being_a_pirate So this
one's called, it's entitled 250

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-1
00:05:56.197 --> 00:06:01.305
years ago, being a pirate. And
it is. It's a scene with on the

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-2
00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:06.576
far right side, we have the edge
of an island or a beach. So you

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-3
00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:11.360
can see the shore. We do see
some palm trees and we see in

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-4
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.144
the very distance like a Cliff
that leads to the water and

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-5
00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:20.360
there's a little bit more
vegetation back there. So

e123a871-f3bf-419c-b15a-96671725daea-6
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.819
there's a lot more

3fb6118f-15b8-4656-93e9-955ae437b665-0
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.438
trees and palm trees, that's
kind of in the distance. And

3fb6118f-15b8-4656-93e9-955ae437b665-1
00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:30.987
then the shore leads out into
the water. And in the water

3fb6118f-15b8-4656-93e9-955ae437b665-2
00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:35.771
there are several ships. There
are, let's see 1, 2. It looks

3fb6118f-15b8-4656-93e9-955ae437b665-3
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:40.634
like there's three big pirate
ships that we can see. And then

3fb6118f-15b8-4656-93e9-955ae437b665-4
00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:43.849
there's also some smaller boats
there's.

6b726780-e29c-46b9-975e-4f2941a5a2d3-0
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.320
A number of smaller boats 123.

d70c98f6-c90c-46ab-981a-6438ed0b019b-0
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.679
Probably about 15 to 20 smaller
boats that are kind of in the

d70c98f6-c90c-46ab-981a-6438ed0b019b-1
00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.940
water surrounding these pirate
ships.

82a00fee-f9d4-44f9-bb39-5d441ec3a0de-0
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.740
The smaller boats have

dd73515f-5d1f-41b2-9c4e-277355ccbec3-0
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.437
are filled with people, pretty
much. There is, it looks like

dd73515f-5d1f-41b2-9c4e-277355ccbec3-1
00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:09.925
one boat that has kind of broken
in half and is sinking, and so

dd73515f-5d1f-41b2-9c4e-277355ccbec3-2
00:07:09.925 --> 00:07:13.991
the passengers are trying to
hold on to the pieces of the

dd73515f-5d1f-41b2-9c4e-277355ccbec3-3
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:18.129
boat, but all the other boats
are intact and it looks like

dd73515f-5d1f-41b2-9c4e-277355ccbec3-4
00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.690
there's.

1db0a12e-0005-4b87-8c20-f3a3a3650314-0
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.617
There's people kind of packed
into these little boats. There's

1db0a12e-0005-4b87-8c20-f3a3a3650314-1
00:07:24.617 --> 00:07:29.020
a number of pirates with swords.
It looks like there's some.

36a632d0-7980-4949-bc65-4df03a189647-0
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.060
Ah.

f6f069d9-d309-4e9b-9fea-1035fad47b48-0
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.237
This is really small. It looks
like there might be some women

f6f069d9-d309-4e9b-9fea-1035fad47b48-1
00:07:37.237 --> 00:07:41.269
even on some of the boats. It's
funny. There's one little boat

f6f069d9-d309-4e9b-9fea-1035fad47b48-2
00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:45.364
with a a single man in it, and
it looks like he's in a hot tub,

f6f069d9-d309-4e9b-9fea-1035fad47b48-3
00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:49.588
kind of a a boat. He's got water
and looks like he's got water on

f6f069d9-d309-4e9b-9fea-1035fad47b48-4
00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:51.060
the inside of the boat.

8d4f76c3-d0e5-437c-b8b8-06c9cbae11d3-0
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.845
And then, um, and they're just,
they're trying to help some of

8d4f76c3-d0e5-437c-b8b8-06c9cbae11d3-1
00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:00.517
the people out of the water,
some of the boats they are, it

8d4f76c3-d0e5-437c-b8b8-06c9cbae11d3-2
00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:03.700
looks like they're trying to hop
from boat to boat.

e29710e3-3884-45d0-8aaa-50a6fb7e3ad0-0
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.170
Anyway, there's the bigger ships
have

52d3eb57-4c2e-4d87-8bdd-6f53d4c23623-0
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.154
are also filled with people, and
there's pirates and people

52d3eb57-4c2e-4d87-8bdd-6f53d4c23623-1
00:08:18.154 --> 00:08:22.489
hanging off of all parts of the
boat, hanging off the side,

52d3eb57-4c2e-4d87-8bdd-6f53d4c23623-2
00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:23.790
jumping overboard.

3239c5c0-1cef-465a-8186-0125467b4a3e-0
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.530
I don't know the little, I don't
know the names but the.

ebd384c7-f4ca-4528-a83f-acfd01722d20-0
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.840
Umm.

90731fc1-6b05-4f87-b68e-ae6e520cd8a4-0
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.459
There's like poles that stick
out from the boat and then

90731fc1-6b05-4f87-b68e-ae6e520cd8a4-1
00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:38.552
there's like a crossbar on that
and they're hanging off of that.

90731fc1-6b05-4f87-b68e-ae6e520cd8a4-2
00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:42.141
It looks like some of them are
fighting with each other.

90731fc1-6b05-4f87-b68e-ae6e520cd8a4-3
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:46.046
They've got a lot of them have
swords and some just have like

90731fc1-6b05-4f87-b68e-ae6e520cd8a4-4
00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:48.249
sticks of some sort in their
hand.

346784be-24d2-4113-9935-0bfd6cfc882c-0
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.273
There it looks like there's a
couple of cannons that are

346784be-24d2-4113-9935-0bfd6cfc882c-1
00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:59.357
shooting off of this one big
pirate ship and then it actually

346784be-24d2-4113-9935-0bfd6cfc882c-2
00:08:59.357 --> 00:09:04.358
looks like some of the smaller
boats have cannons on them as

346784be-24d2-4113-9935-0bfd6cfc882c-3
00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:09.606
well that are shooting back at
the bigger pirate ships. There's

346784be-24d2-4113-9935-0bfd6cfc882c-4
00:09:09.606 --> 00:09:12.640
think we said there's people
kind of

d7154f8f-a0d8-4be2-94c9-e55e16297ebf-0
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.227
Who are trying to climb out,
trying to climb on, jumping

d7154f8f-a0d8-4be2-94c9-e55e16297ebf-1
00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:22.826
over. Uh, there is 123. There's
a bunch of boats have pirate

d7154f8f-a0d8-4be2-94c9-e55e16297ebf-2
00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:27.500
flags on them, the black and
white, kind of like a skull with

d7154f8f-a0d8-4be2-94c9-e55e16297ebf-3
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.270
the the crossbones behind it.
#END_being_a_pirate

71fdff82-bcc8-4eb1-b6a6-082f1fc3873d-0
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.160
And is that good? Yes, that's
OK. So then the last item is a

71fdff82-bcc8-4eb1-b6a6-082f1fc3873d-1
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.839
long series of pictures. OK,
please describe what you see.

71fdff82-bcc8-4eb1-b6a6-082f1fc3873d-2
00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:50.710
But you don't have to dwell on a
particular page for a long,

71fdff82-bcc8-4eb1-b6a6-082f1fc3873d-3
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.019
because it's quite long.

452c9fb9-72e8-446d-bafc-dee84e94a296-0
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.760
Yeah.

4768e8de-a63a-4f6b-9400-7faf618a3c26-0
00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.968
#START_wanderer OK, so we are
back to another. This is like a

4768e8de-a63a-4f6b-9400-7faf618a3c26-1
00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.160
black and white.

1e74a757-7e5a-4f64-b68c-2bcad9a0c852-0
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.941
Sketched type of picture scene.
I don't know that we've actually

1e74a757-7e5a-4f64-b68c-2bcad9a0c852-1
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:14.001
seen this one before. This one
might be new. We see two men.

1e74a757-7e5a-4f64-b68c-2bcad9a0c852-2
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:18.480
One man is dressed in all black.
He's in some kind of

a75eb128-41c9-4bab-8458-4b5b80f4722d-0
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.240
almost like

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-0
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.028
like a military outfit of some
sort, maybe with like a long

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-1
00:10:26.028 --> 00:10:30.668
Cape. And he has on some kind of
a head covering that's black and

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-2
00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:35.026
it has a small horn that sticks
out from the back of his head

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-3
00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:39.455
and a larger horn that sticks
out from his forehead and curves

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-4
00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:43.814
up. And then the other man that
we see, appears to have light

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-5
00:10:43.814 --> 00:10:48.243
color hair, a striped shirt and
just pants on. He's, he's kind

3cfb0168-d640-4eb1-8d43-c1e9901371cf-6
00:10:48.243 --> 00:10:52.109
of dressed normal. Anyway, the
two of them are folding

5d9fc82e-36bd-4809-946e-b80b18a0cb30-0
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:58.078
This it's like a giant piece of
paper and they are folding it

5d9fc82e-36bd-4809-946e-b80b18a0cb30-1
00:10:58.078 --> 00:11:03.380
kind of like into origami and
the shape of the origami.

4d577698-c078-4fc2-9fb5-1341f796f11a-0
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.715
Is kind of like a little boat. I
guess that's a little boat that

4d577698-c078-4fc2-9fb5-1341f796f11a-1
00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:12.802
they're trying to make with this
large piece of paper. So they're

4d577698-c078-4fc2-9fb5-1341f796f11a-2
00:11:12.802 --> 00:11:16.828
working together to hold it and
the next scene we can see a very

4d577698-c078-4fc2-9fb5-1341f796f11a-3
00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:17.199
large.

5dd59e43-c1a1-4662-a05d-09d75df576f5-0
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.080
A black ship.

162186a7-10fd-4395-b9c4-0515f34fccae-0
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.250
That has.

56556026-1f98-4436-8e26-22ff5651a15d-0
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.680
I don't know what those are.
They're not flags, they're.

a59d3ef7-f048-4382-8a4a-8efa48a581ad-0
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.290
They're kind of like, I don't
know, they're striped.

a1bca141-0e25-4833-a234-a875f8ae4cf5-0
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.979
It's not kite, but something
kind of like that that that

a1bca141-0e25-4833-a234-a875f8ae4cf5-1
00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:40.317
floats in the air. They're
attached to the some of the

a1bca141-0e25-4833-a234-a875f8ae4cf5-2
00:11:40.317 --> 00:11:44.141
beams on the ship and they just
kind of float on the backside.

a1bca141-0e25-4833-a234-a875f8ae4cf5-3
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:48.086
We do see under the water there
is a propeller and there is like

a1bca141-0e25-4833-a234-a875f8ae4cf5-4
00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:48.390
this.

86b2e14d-c7c9-4676-96a7-f0b6fe152fbb-0
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.929
I I don't even know what that
is. So I but in that picture,

86b2e14d-c7c9-4676-96a7-f0b6fe152fbb-1
00:11:53.929 --> 00:11:57.842
next to this big ship, along the
water, we see this little

86b2e14d-c7c9-4676-96a7-f0b6fe152fbb-2
00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:02.153
origami boat that these two men
have made, and it's very tiny in

86b2e14d-c7c9-4676-96a7-f0b6fe152fbb-3
00:12:02.153 --> 00:12:04.210
comparison off in the distance.

ec464115-19b6-4c1e-b313-42c89fc68b58-0
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:12.156
Now we have an overview and we
see the sea of water and we see

ec464115-19b6-4c1e-b313-42c89fc68b58-1
00:12:12.156 --> 00:12:17.262
this tiny little boat sailing,
this origami boat sailing in the

ec464115-19b6-4c1e-b313-42c89fc68b58-2
00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:22.288
water. And we also see, I guess
those are seagulls, a bunch of

ec464115-19b6-4c1e-b313-42c89fc68b58-3
00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:26.995
seagulls that are that are
flying in the sky kind of above

ec464115-19b6-4c1e-b313-42c89fc68b58-4
00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:28.990
this boat over the water.

8fb44542-97f8-4b24-8c25-77306e35aa7b-0
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:37.802
We see a picture of the little
origami boat floating in the

8fb44542-97f8-4b24-8c25-77306e35aa7b-1
00:12:37.802 --> 00:12:43.149
water. One seagull has actually
landed on the side of the

8fb44542-97f8-4b24-8c25-77306e35aa7b-2
00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:49.050
origami boat, and there are 123
turtles. They're like black and

8fb44542-97f8-4b24-8c25-77306e35aa7b-3
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:54.767
white and they have on their
shell. It's like a diamond, like

8fb44542-97f8-4b24-8c25-77306e35aa7b-4
00:12:54.767 --> 00:13:00.022
a black and white diamond
checkerboard pattern. And then

8fb44542-97f8-4b24-8c25-77306e35aa7b-5
00:13:00.022 --> 00:13:02.420
their head and their arms.

88848059-09d9-4c0e-b169-69281d06f8d9-0
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.690
Are kind of. They're like black
with white.

474f9297-abb6-4647-9b8f-93f322bc0ed8-0
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.420
Like Cross Cross ohh God.

6b069988-feb8-45a7-893a-737e2855780f-0
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.353
Anyway, it's like it's got white
lines that go horizontal and

6b069988-feb8-45a7-893a-737e2855780f-1
00:13:19.353 --> 00:13:24.317
vertical to kind of make like
like a graph or crisscross type

6b069988-feb8-45a7-893a-737e2855780f-2
00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:28.479
of a design and then we can see
the little boat is.

d8174f94-569b-44be-9f77-c5d394cfc551-0
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.964
I don't know what that is. Maybe
some maybe like a whale. I don't

d8174f94-569b-44be-9f77-c5d394cfc551-1
00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:40.208
know. It's it's a black, it's a
black, a very large black object

d8174f94-569b-44be-9f77-c5d394cfc551-2
00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:43.920
or animal and it has these
little round white

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-0
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.517
Dots all over it that are coming
from the water. So I don't know

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-1
00:13:48.517 --> 00:13:52.444
if those are bubbles, if that's
supposed to be bubbles on there.

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-2
00:13:52.444 --> 00:13:55.949
But they're round like like
little bubbles against white,

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-3
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:59.816
white bubbles against this black
thing. OK, yeah. So now we can

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-4
00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:03.381
see it's the whale and maybe
that's just the design. Maybe

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-5
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:07.248
because we see the white on the
underside of the whale and then

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-6
00:14:07.248 --> 00:14:10.752
it gradually it's got black on
top and it does have these

807a6671-d754-4c6c-9f75-2a716cc7fe6d-7
00:14:10.752 --> 00:14:14.679
little white specks all over it.
So it may just be the the skin.

0e826199-9dc6-4918-b439-1841757d6416-0
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.411
Of the whale. But now we can see
the boat sitting on the very top

0e826199-9dc6-4918-b439-1841757d6416-1
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:25.814
part of the whale, and the whale
is pretty much submerged, but

0e826199-9dc6-4918-b439-1841757d6416-2
00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:30.360
below the water, very, very
large. We see a bunch of

0e826199-9dc6-4918-b439-1841757d6416-3
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.078
different sea creatures and
fish. We see coral and sea

0e826199-9dc6-4918-b439-1841757d6416-4
00:14:35.078 --> 00:14:40.396
plants. Looks like there's a
like a sea lion, just a bunch of

0e826199-9dc6-4918-b439-1841757d6416-5
00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:45.200
fish swimming around the sea
life down below the water.

0ff35f97-13d6-4c3a-aa66-5af9b1816ac7-0
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.959
And the next picture we see just
some more images of this sea

0ff35f97-13d6-4c3a-aa66-5af9b1816ac7-1
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:54.975
life. I wish I was better at
describing the different types

0ff35f97-13d6-4c3a-aa66-5af9b1816ac7-2
00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:59.124
of plants, but again, I believe
there's definitely some coral

0ff35f97-13d6-4c3a-aa66-5af9b1816ac7-3
00:14:59.124 --> 00:15:02.269
and some other sea plants, just
different fish

956bf733-217d-4e1a-9e72-8d0ae7d91952-0
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.516
that are swimming around and the
boat is actually this little

956bf733-217d-4e1a-9e72-8d0ae7d91952-1
00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:12.922
origami boat has now hit kind of
like a mound of fish that are

956bf733-217d-4e1a-9e72-8d0ae7d91952-2
00:15:12.922 --> 00:15:15.440
very close to the top of the
water.

86645310-26ad-4741-9d31-aa897916df36-0
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.240
Now we see.

e8adda91-6407-4964-b0b7-6ccabedda7ba-0
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.036
A picture of the boat, just
above kind of, kind of just

e8adda91-6407-4964-b0b7-6ccabedda7ba-1
00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:27.350
above this this.

82b80d93-4aa2-4f70-80f5-6e4d493d7a2d-0
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.850
Plant area. We do see these.

fed8d6b5-8ee8-4440-9cd6-670c25ec8ed4-0
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.163
I don't know if those are
supposed to be seahorses.

fed8d6b5-8ee8-4440-9cd6-670c25ec8ed4-1
00:15:38.163 --> 00:15:41.826
They're they're kind of like
Oval sea creatures with little

fed8d6b5-8ee8-4440-9cd6-670c25ec8ed4-2
00:15:41.826 --> 00:15:45.427
white specks, white eyes, and
then their faces, like their

fed8d6b5-8ee8-4440-9cd6-670c25ec8ed4-3
00:15:45.427 --> 00:15:48.540
mouths, it's like a little. It's
like they have a.

78b6f3a5-d0db-4576-a8ae-59f4ef4f9c5b-0
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.360
Different.

1d1626f5-4aab-4e7d-96b3-04bca76cedb2-0
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.011
I'm not, I guess tentacles of
some sort maybe coming out not

1d1626f5-4aab-4e7d-96b3-04bca76cedb2-1
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:58.833
like a not like an octopus, but
they're kind of all joined

1d1626f5-4aab-4e7d-96b3-04bca76cedb2-2
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:02.979
together and there's a variety
of them and it looks like one of

1d1626f5-4aab-4e7d-96b3-04bca76cedb2-3
00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:06.996
them is actually like attached
on to the bottom of the paper,

1d1626f5-4aab-4e7d-96b3-04bca76cedb2-4
00:16:06.996 --> 00:16:08.810
the origami boat. We do see.

7121b3ac-eb2e-4f66-a212-1e084976ea63-0
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.920
Two, it's like 2 fish that are
kissing.

d0583ad9-e3ae-46e3-8f3d-af0b29267491-0
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.060
But the bottom of the fish
morphs into like.

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-0
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.602
A fish human body. So it's like
the head is a fish and then the

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-1
00:16:25.602 --> 00:16:30.024
bottom of the fish merges with
the neck of a human and you see

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-2
00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:34.305
two arms and they're holding
hands, looks like they have two

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-3
00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:38.868
legs, but they do still have the
the scales and the fish skin on

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-4
00:16:38.868 --> 00:16:42.658
their body. On the other side
again we see some other

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-5
00:16:42.658 --> 00:16:46.378
different fish and sea
creatures, looks like there's

e47a7cdf-5fb1-4407-8e4b-63b1b058ba22-6
00:16:46.378 --> 00:16:46.939
another.

d43e0760-e9aa-46b9-bf38-0f4562290ffb-0
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:48.760
Uh.

7d9859da-68d1-4580-a19c-20f27f568313-0
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.208
Type of fish that has the same
thing, like a fish head that's

7d9859da-68d1-4580-a19c-20f27f568313-1
00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:59.859
on an actual body with two hands
and that one is actually holding

7d9859da-68d1-4580-a19c-20f27f568313-2
00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:04.087
a pair of scissors. There's some
striped fish and some more

7d9859da-68d1-4580-a19c-20f27f568313-3
00:17:04.087 --> 00:17:04.510
plant.

6c7a7558-0f30-4b9d-80ff-518d57f3d3e6-0
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.660
Some more plants.

bf0821eb-9784-4e3d-b584-cbfabbc553b1-0
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.320
In the in the second picture,
the boat now has a fishing rod

bf0821eb-9784-4e3d-b584-cbfabbc553b1-1
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.579
that's hanging over and the line
is down and they've actually

bf0821eb-9784-4e3d-b584-cbfabbc553b1-2
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.160
hooked one of the fish.

716dd91f-74a9-499b-ab20-204139d7cf96-0
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:31.318
Let's see. Now we see the boat
and it comes over a plant that

716dd91f-74a9-499b-ab20-204139d7cf96-1
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:33.840
has a fish that is.

95d90179-eada-4da4-97dd-5b86928cd806-0
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.122
It looks like it's like a
checkered seahorse. It's like a

95d90179-eada-4da4-97dd-5b86928cd806-1
00:17:40.122 --> 00:17:43.523
it's, I think it's a seahorse
that has like a checkerboard

95d90179-eada-4da4-97dd-5b86928cd806-2
00:17:43.523 --> 00:17:46.866
design, black and white, black
face and it's wearing like

95d90179-eada-4da4-97dd-5b86928cd806-3
00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:47.269
little.

bf34b1b0-d7b5-4f7b-9c7c-270a10f2ae11-0
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.959
Origami hat that is very similar
to the boat that's traveling.

bf34b1b0-d7b5-4f7b-9c7c-270a10f2ae11-1
00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:55.900
Anyway the fish is standing kind
of on the.

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-0
00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.575
Standing or resting on the top
of this plant, sticking up out

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-1
00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:06.205
of the water. So the boat comes
to where this fish and the

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-2
00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:10.835
seahorse are. Umm. And then in
the next picture we can see

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-3
00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:14.995
again more fish, more plant
life. But there is a the

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-4
00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:19.939
seahorse is now inside of the
little origami boat and there is

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-5
00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:24.648
some kind of a almost like a
snake. It's very long and thin

fea88fea-0aee-4b0e-a017-d1c5c1a98577-6
00:18:24.648 --> 00:18:26.610
and it is kind of hooked.

91ecbff2-883f-4f76-b3c0-86ecbb34f7d5-0
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.130
It's head into the little
origami boat.

2184d6b4-de1e-400d-b524-496147037e4e-0
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.240
Now we see a picture of.

4b0115d9-0ab9-4fee-833c-b085e135533e-0
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.964
We're above water. We still see
the water. We see the little

4b0115d9-0ab9-4fee-833c-b085e135533e-1
00:18:42.964 --> 00:18:44.340
origami boat with the.

0f59b317-94bb-47fe-8ee2-bf5b7a75b3bc-0
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.220
It's a seahorse or sea lion.

45ccd99c-1602-4de2-990f-8035f0d78843-0
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.540
Anyway, it's still got its
little checkerboard.

47c5c81f-9714-4215-9ef9-05a9226096db-0
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.927
Skin and there's randomly these
little flowers that are popped

47c5c81f-9714-4215-9ef9-05a9226096db-1
00:19:01.927 --> 00:19:07.135
up through the water with little
petals, and the boat is heading

47c5c81f-9714-4215-9ef9-05a9226096db-2
00:19:07.135 --> 00:19:12.262
to an area of trees. And there
are all these cranes, these like

47c5c81f-9714-4215-9ef9-05a9226096db-3
00:19:12.262 --> 00:19:17.070
white cranes that are peppered
in to the trees that you can

47c5c81f-9714-4215-9ef9-05a9226096db-4
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.716
see. They're kind of in the
trees, resting and feeding on

47c5c81f-9714-4215-9ef9-05a9226096db-5
00:19:21.716 --> 00:19:23.800
the leaves or the berries.

01a60357-19a8-426f-8fad-f9e569e3c38e-0
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:32.812
Then we have... A little bit
closer, we can see the boat has

01a60357-19a8-426f-8fad-f9e569e3c38e-1
00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:34.390
sailed into this.

c12d9f2e-bc68-44bb-8427-e27f3d3b0306-0
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.276
Treed area below the water.
Again, there's different schools

c12d9f2e-bc68-44bb-8427-e27f3d3b0306-1
00:19:39.276 --> 00:19:43.759
of fish that are swimming around
and more plant life. There is a

c12d9f2e-bc68-44bb-8427-e27f3d3b0306-2
00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:48.241
start. There's a couple starfish
on the bottom, and a lot of the

c12d9f2e-bc68-44bb-8427-e27f3d3b0306-3
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:52.310
fish appear to have stripes,
like black and white stripes,

c12d9f2e-bc68-44bb-8427-e27f3d3b0306-4
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.000
but they're different stripe
patterns.

0d0b1990-fc1f-4e42-949c-bd9d2b7023d8-0
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.690
Umm.

de4e7952-1125-4936-a987-4d2fa9358d13-0
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.708
Once into this treed area, it's
like a little canal. We see the

de4e7952-1125-4936-a987-4d2fa9358d13-1
00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:11.060
seahorse in this little origami
boat. We can see looks like

de4e7952-1125-4936-a987-4d2fa9358d13-2
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.234
little crabs that are kind of
crawling up one of the tree

de4e7952-1125-4936-a987-4d2fa9358d13-3
00:20:16.234 --> 00:20:20.070
branches, and the tree branches
have this.

8d155389-afaf-4e01-9b98-beb696fff6aa-0
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.691
Kind of pattern on them. I
don't. I can't tell if they're

8d155389-afaf-4e01-9b98-beb696fff6aa-1
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:27.050
floral or whether it's just like
little round.

22aed4bc-0055-4168-bd98-d6ef0fbed45e-0
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.369
Pattern, But there's a pattern
to the tree limbs. There are

22aed4bc-0055-4168-bd98-d6ef0fbed45e-1
00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:33.750
four.

65aff192-b5a2-4cc4-9ac3-74fdfb58487d-0
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:39.494
There are four little birds that
are perched in on one of the

65aff192-b5a2-4cc4-9ac3-74fdfb58487d-1
00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:44.580
limbs. There's another random
bird and then there are there is

65aff192-b5a2-4cc4-9ac3-74fdfb58487d-2
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.826
this one animal that has 12345,
it's got like 6 heads and it has

65aff192-b5a2-4cc4-9ac3-74fdfb58487d-3
00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:54.831
246 at least eight arms that we
can see. And it is perched on

65aff192-b5a2-4cc4-9ac3-74fdfb58487d-4
00:20:54.831 --> 00:21:00.078
one of the branches as well and
that it's got spikes on the back

65aff192-b5a2-4cc4-9ac3-74fdfb58487d-5
00:21:00.078 --> 00:21:04.760
of its head and it's kind of
dark in color and the white.

95e50766-a1da-4778-bf02-690cfd54e680-0
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.585
Eyes are kind of glowing through
and then there's also some looks

95e50766-a1da-4778-bf02-690cfd54e680-1
00:21:08.585 --> 00:21:11.820
like some flowers that also have
a checkerboard pattern.

331f9d14-4651-42e4-9c9f-ae75d612d338-0
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:24.057
We see the boat sailing to the
other side of the treed area. It

331f9d14-4651-42e4-9c9f-ae75d612d338-1
00:21:24.057 --> 00:21:26.480
looks like there is a.

11973b2b-357b-4d53-bbc7-1e85312f3c91-0
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.320
Maybe like a?

ff878e5e-8f99-4ba7-bbd3-7347764861b5-0
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:35.107
Crawfish, or I guess like a
crawfish. It's got like a hard

ff878e5e-8f99-4ba7-bbd3-7347764861b5-1
00:21:35.107 --> 00:21:41.438
tail and it's got two like long
tentacles in the front. Maybe I

ff878e5e-8f99-4ba7-bbd3-7347764861b5-2
00:21:41.438 --> 00:21:46.880
don't think it's a lobster, but
maybe it is a lobster.

e99fb1b9-6e29-4b92-97e3-6298d7debe36-0
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.861
I don't know. And it has a bunch
of different legs and it is

e99fb1b9-6e29-4b92-97e3-6298d7debe36-1
00:21:52.861 --> 00:21:53.430
carrying.

af098435-ce38-4ca2-baf7-544e6bf796f1-0
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.750
Kind of like a.

4ab74ec6-8770-4029-a8f1-be2966cd622a-0
00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.180
It's like a cross between a
maybe a butterfly and a person.

4ab74ec6-8770-4029-a8f1-be2966cd622a-1
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.389
Again, it's got two arms and two
legs. It has two wings on its

4ab74ec6-8770-4029-a8f1-be2966cd622a-2
00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:13.680
back and it has kind of Gray in
color with these black circles.

4ab74ec6-8770-4029-a8f1-be2966cd622a-3
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.806
That's the pattern of the the
skin. And it's like riding this

4ab74ec6-8770-4029-a8f1-be2966cd622a-4
00:22:18.806 --> 00:22:23.932
either like crawfish or this
lobster. We see another sea, sea

4ab74ec6-8770-4029-a8f1-be2966cd622a-5
00:22:23.932 --> 00:22:28.479
or school of fish and some more
plant life and we see.

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-0
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.635
Actually, we see a crab on one
of the limbs, but we see a

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-1
00:22:32.635 --> 00:22:36.640
couple more of these checkered
black and white checkered

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-2
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.645
pattern seahorses. And we
actually see the seahorse jump

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-3
00:22:40.645 --> 00:22:44.790
out of the origami boat over to
hang out and stay with his

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-4
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.287
friends. And he looks like the
hat goes in the air and he loses

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-5
00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:53.714
his hat as he jumps out of the
boat. As the water, as the boat

1df2334d-9bf7-4228-855e-784c18e38dbb-6
00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.190
goes along the water.

0160918d-b312-48cb-93ba-e99fa5d37981-0
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.127
So we again we see the little
boat traveling along the water.

0160918d-b312-48cb-93ba-e99fa5d37981-1
00:23:03.127 --> 00:23:04.600
This time we can see.

0a596df3-39f4-4f66-8004-af55e4f2e3f5-0
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.283
I guess maybe, maybe the other
one was a shark. Maybe this is

0a596df3-39f4-4f66-8004-af55e4f2e3f5-1
00:23:10.283 --> 00:23:10.860
the whale.

22d81fbc-184e-4350-8e15-1f47d1212b59-0
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.310
You can see a I guess this is a.

7078df86-261f-44ea-95b1-975d3726f0dd-0
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:21.436
Big whale, we see its head is
above water, it's very large and

7078df86-261f-44ea-95b1-975d3726f0dd-1
00:23:21.436 --> 00:23:26.249
the rest of its body is
submerged below water it has.

7078df86-261f-44ea-95b1-975d3726f0dd-2
00:23:26.249 --> 00:23:31.776
There's a small little group of
like very small fish that are

7078df86-261f-44ea-95b1-975d3726f0dd-3
00:23:31.776 --> 00:23:37.392
swimming way underneath the sea
level, and it looks like there

7078df86-261f-44ea-95b1-975d3726f0dd-4
00:23:37.392 --> 00:23:37.660
is.

2f2bdba2-de58-448d-b06c-3ff96fa4b786-0
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.689
Something out of the on the head
part of this whale that has

2f2bdba2-de58-448d-b06c-3ff96fa4b786-1
00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:47.460
little hole and there's like
smoke coming out of it.

d76fc4c7-c242-487c-b1d7-b1167c74f54b-0
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.830
But the little boat is passing
by. This whale is is black on

d76fc4c7-c242-487c-b1d7-b1167c74f54b-1
00:23:54.830 --> 00:24:00.245
the top and on most of his body,
but on the other underside it's

d76fc4c7-c242-487c-b1d7-b1167c74f54b-2
00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:05.409
white with black stripes. We
then are able to see this little

d76fc4c7-c242-487c-b1d7-b1167c74f54b-3
00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:10.407
hole now has like a fishing rod
that comes out of this with

d76fc4c7-c242-487c-b1d7-b1167c74f54b-4
00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:15.737
this. Is that the same thing? I
guess no, it's a different one.

d76fc4c7-c242-487c-b1d7-b1167c74f54b-5
00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:18.320
It's an how do I describe that?

036a009b-c781-46bc-8f17-af9bc9748647-0
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.170
Good golly.

a369bb32-90da-46cd-9702-10926f7f5c52-0
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.754
I don't know. It's it's it's
kind of like the whale. It's

a369bb32-90da-46cd-9702-10926f7f5c52-1
00:24:29.754 --> 00:24:34.460
it's another very large
creature, black in color, round

a369bb32-90da-46cd-9702-10926f7f5c52-2
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.923
head. We do see a little eye, a
white eye, and we do see a mouth

a369bb32-90da-46cd-9702-10926f7f5c52-3
00:24:39.923 --> 00:24:45.385
with what looks like to be very
lots of very sharp teeth, but it

a369bb32-90da-46cd-9702-10926f7f5c52-4
00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:46.310
has like 2.

2f1e6e60-2fb0-4a8a-9d7a-91976912b326-0
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:53.434
Lobster claw type arms that come
out of it and then it has four

2f1e6e60-2fb0-4a8a-9d7a-91976912b326-1
00:24:53.434 --> 00:24:55.140
legs at the bottom.

97f0de8f-f725-432f-adf7-c27cef4ee3e7-0
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.857
And it's standing on like a pile
of old ships and boats that have

97f0de8f-f725-432f-adf7-c27cef4ee3e7-1
00:25:00.857 --> 00:25:05.580
sunk below the water and kind of
it's standing on this pile of

97f0de8f-f725-432f-adf7-c27cef4ee3e7-2
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.303
ships. It does have little white
polka dots that go down under

97f0de8f-f725-432f-adf7-c27cef4ee3e7-3
00:25:10.303 --> 00:25:15.026
from it's kind of like its chin
down its stomach area and then

97f0de8f-f725-432f-adf7-c27cef4ee3e7-4
00:25:15.026 --> 00:25:17.800
on the backside it has these
little.

40774fda-f34f-47f1-9df5-51eb174fa8ae-0
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.420
Kind of ruffled.

f3a2f27b-cb1d-440e-b4c5-753247066b9f-0
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:28.941
Flower petal like pieces that
stick out from its backside and

f3a2f27b-cb1d-440e-b4c5-753247066b9f-1
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:30.450
the tail is.

41e547e2-24cd-4d44-9260-7916eac86a4b-0
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.109
Wow, the tail is kind of like, I
guess they're kind of like

41e547e2-24cd-4d44-9260-7916eac86a4b-1
00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:41.908
tentacles like from an octopus,
but there's a lot of them and so

41e547e2-24cd-4d44-9260-7916eac86a4b-2
00:25:41.908 --> 00:25:45.968
it makes like a very and they're
kind of curled up and

41e547e2-24cd-4d44-9260-7916eac86a4b-3
00:25:45.968 --> 00:25:50.693
intertwined and that's kind of
like the the back, rear end tail

41e547e2-24cd-4d44-9260-7916eac86a4b-4
00:25:50.693 --> 00:25:55.049
part of this thing. Anyway, on
its head it has this little

41e547e2-24cd-4d44-9260-7916eac86a4b-5
00:25:55.049 --> 00:25:55.640
opening.

da92d969-1678-468b-89f4-c034ff015b73-0
00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.600
And there's a fishing pole. The
majority of it's underwater, but

da92d969-1678-468b-89f4-c034ff015b73-1
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.374
this part is above water. It
looks like there's a fishing

da92d969-1678-468b-89f4-c034ff015b73-2
00:26:04.374 --> 00:26:08.474
pole and off this fishing pole
is hanging like either a box or

da92d969-1678-468b-89f4-c034ff015b73-3
00:26:08.474 --> 00:26:08.800
a TV.

8d6f638c-ba66-4daa-8b44-179eb49e6a73-0
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.980
And the paper boat is sailing
right towards this creature.

878e46f9-5b13-4290-a5b9-352fa95bc041-0
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.230
Oh boy.

7bc3f702-9d93-4690-8745-7834b8f6831e-0
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:27.250
Then we see. Looks like it's
night time now, because we can

7bc3f702-9d93-4690-8745-7834b8f6831e-1
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:27.600
see.

52325a20-c8dc-4588-9346-7b4a5d502bea-0
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.840
There's.

bbc59b9f-56e6-4b34-b4cc-38d9acbe8a26-0
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.020
The sun is setting.

d5a57c24-1550-4fa2-be57-28436d641941-0
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:40.007
And it's right against the
horizon of the sky in the in the

d5a57c24-1550-4fa2-be57-28436d641941-1
00:26:40.007 --> 00:26:44.095
sea, but we don't actually see
the sun. It's a it's around

d5a57c24-1550-4fa2-be57-28436d641941-2
00:26:44.095 --> 00:26:44.580
shaped.

246e531c-a6e3-4b4a-8378-14b1f2be8be1-0
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:51.575
It actually looks like a fish.
It's like the sun is a fish, but

246e531c-a6e3-4b4a-8378-14b1f2be8be1-1
00:26:51.575 --> 00:26:56.943
it is radiating light. We do see
a snake off in the distance that

246e531c-a6e3-4b4a-8378-14b1f2be8be1-2
00:26:56.943 --> 00:27:01.742
is sailing along some kind of
snake that sailing along the

246e531c-a6e3-4b4a-8378-14b1f2be8be1-3
00:27:01.742 --> 00:27:02.230
water.

bf89c95f-2c61-4632-9016-1e99578e5239-0
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.838
And then up in the sky we can
see what would be the moon I

bf89c95f-2c61-4632-9016-1e99578e5239-1
00:27:07.838 --> 00:27:12.138
guess, but again it has, it's
white on the backside, but on

bf89c95f-2c61-4632-9016-1e99578e5239-2
00:27:12.138 --> 00:27:16.725
the front side it's it's shaped
like a round fish and we do see

bf89c95f-2c61-4632-9016-1e99578e5239-3
00:27:16.725 --> 00:27:20.881
a tail and some fins and a
little bit of a face. It looks

bf89c95f-2c61-4632-9016-1e99578e5239-4
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:24.680
like we have a bat flying
through the sky we've got.

8e670c27-af11-4d6a-95b7-1341f3ff1c10-0
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.420
These.

c73ed274-047c-450e-b4f4-a6ba11be2e53-0
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.110
Birds that are they look like
fish. Like long kind of.

71ed8ddd-a555-4ddd-ab6e-77b8c6fb5749-0
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.870
Narrow fish they do have.

ed336302-c1c0-4b95-8a63-47fde14f6c8a-0
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.580
Tails.

55a80880-d7a5-4113-99c8-4542affb36d5-0
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.480
But they have like butterfly
wings attached to them.

aeb538d2-c258-4313-9c46-663d722f9d76-0
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.450
Then there is.

bf358e77-c5ed-4e9f-b83f-0507e919d275-0
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.010
There's a.

36224e84-c681-48c8-90eb-bfbd52b4310f-0
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.310
I guess that's supposed to be
like a seahorse, but it's.

99dfe23b-a0e0-4cb8-95c6-53b0c1b87b9a-0
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.420
It's got a the pattern and the
end of it, and then the head is

99dfe23b-a0e0-4cb8-95c6-53b0c1b87b9a-1
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.329
almost like a Joker. You know
how like a Joker has those

99dfe23b-a0e0-4cb8-95c6-53b0c1b87b9a-2
00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:01.810
little?

593b56ab-eac6-43e5-91d6-37e2dd815721-0
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.772
Things that stick out from their
heads or their hats, and they

593b56ab-eac6-43e5-91d6-37e2dd815721-1
00:28:06.772 --> 00:28:10.705
have like little bells on them.
The sea creature is like a Joker

593b56ab-eac6-43e5-91d6-37e2dd815721-2
00:28:10.705 --> 00:28:14.215
seahorse. And then we see a
bunch of different animals on

593b56ab-eac6-43e5-91d6-37e2dd815721-3
00:28:14.215 --> 00:28:17.846
the bottom, kind of all around
this little origami boat. It

593b56ab-eac6-43e5-91d6-37e2dd815721-4
00:28:17.846 --> 00:28:21.537
looks like there's a black cat,
but instead of paws, the cat

593b56ab-eac6-43e5-91d6-37e2dd815721-5
00:28:21.537 --> 00:28:21.780
has.

ee11f773-c0c3-4598-9d03-b6beae709984-0
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.452
Tails. Um, it looks like some
form of a dog, a zebra, a

ee11f773-c0c3-4598-9d03-b6beae709984-1
00:28:27.452 --> 00:28:33.235
cheetah, an elephant, a giraffe,
a lion. But they're all they're

ee11f773-c0c3-4598-9d03-b6beae709984-2
00:28:33.235 --> 00:28:38.840
all those animals, but they have
tails instead for their paws.

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-0
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.828
So now it is night time. We can
see just a sliver of the moon,

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-1
00:28:46.828 --> 00:28:50.779
the Crescent moon, and we see
what I would imagine. There's

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-2
00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:54.993
some stars in the sky. It's the
black sky, but it's lit up with

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-3
00:28:54.993 --> 00:28:58.746
all these little white dots. And
you can see little boat

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-4
00:28:58.746 --> 00:29:03.026
traveling in the water, but you
can also see this school of fish

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-5
00:29:03.026 --> 00:29:07.240
that's just under the water and
they're dark, but you see their

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-6
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.191
little eyes kind of glowing,
probably a reflection from the

897d5765-ca1f-4d6d-8208-a8429ac446ed-7
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:11.850
the stars.

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-0
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:20.288
Now we see this little boat and
again it's still dark, still

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-1
00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:24.343
night time. We see this little
origami boat. It is now

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-2
00:29:24.343 --> 00:29:28.620
surrounded by this group of
fish, the school of fish, and

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-3
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.266
they are peering up out of the
water. So their tails are under

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-4
00:29:33.266 --> 00:29:37.174
the water but their heads are
out and they have just

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-5
00:29:37.174 --> 00:29:41.451
completely surrounded this
little origami boat. You can't

5fa07ea1-3151-451f-8e4b-d371c50d57c4-6
00:29:41.451 --> 00:29:43.589
even really see the water or.

981b1084-f4ec-4381-88c3-e0a8d021e137-0
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.030
Sky, you just see this.

8aeb52f9-a646-4af2-8832-ac26557c9208-0
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:46.670


49b55268-e265-43b2-8154-4699bc21e128-0
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.507
Just large group of fish
surrounding this boat and their

49b55268-e265-43b2-8154-4699bc21e128-1
00:29:51.507 --> 00:29:52.820
little white eyes.

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-0
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.471
But the boat travels through
them and he travels on and the

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-1
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:03.822
fish dive back down into the
water. You can see there's a

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-2
00:30:03.822 --> 00:30:08.324
couple of the tails that are
still sticking up as they dive

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-3
00:30:08.324 --> 00:30:13.051
back in. Still under the starry
sky, but there's now this kind

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-4
00:30:13.051 --> 00:30:17.702
of whitish in color. It looks
like a large ribbon that's just

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-5
00:30:17.702 --> 00:30:22.354
kind of woven through the sky,
looks like a White Ribbon with

cd647540-b100-44a2-a3ff-f8c1b36ee81c-6
00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.680
these black stripes vertically.

15cf5a36-a467-4c61-a043-8cf058eebaa1-0
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.120
Uh, that's woven through the
sky.

5a0885f2-ec42-485d-9aa6-a3798170755b-0
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.534
Then again, we see this little
origami boat sailing through the

5a0885f2-ec42-485d-9aa6-a3798170755b-1
00:30:35.534 --> 00:30:39.298
water and you can see that. We
can tell it's the water because

5a0885f2-ec42-485d-9aa6-a3798170755b-2
00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:42.764
of the waves. There's just
little waves that tell us it's

5a0885f2-ec42-485d-9aa6-a3798170755b-3
00:30:42.764 --> 00:30:46.588
the water. Now we have this big
white structure in front of us.

5a0885f2-ec42-485d-9aa6-a3798170755b-4
00:30:46.588 --> 00:30:48.680
It looks like it's some kind of
a.

6179b42a-f281-4e6f-9e4d-cc60f1d47690-0
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.080
A rock like a large rock type
of.

d106a8d1-b763-4e20-9a3c-43ac2fbf9cda-0
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:55.550
Of.

a2141baf-879f-442c-8c0e-cf0d3bb6d8be-0
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.558
Yeah, I don't know I it's it's
some kind of rock I would

a2141baf-879f-442c-8c0e-cf0d3bb6d8be-1
00:31:03.558 --> 00:31:03.940
assume.

ec272aa8-2060-499f-a9f1-b10ba239f205-0
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.910
So now I don't know if this is
the same thing.

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-0
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.685
Unsure as to whether or not this
is the rock, but now we can see

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-1
00:31:16.685 --> 00:31:20.109
the boat enter into another
structure that's got, it's

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-2
00:31:20.109 --> 00:31:24.217
obviously some kind of a rock or
solid structure, but it's almost

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-3
00:31:24.217 --> 00:31:28.014
like a cave. Like we can see
these rounded openings that the

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-4
00:31:28.014 --> 00:31:31.997
boat is sailing through and we
do see that there's little rocks

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-5
00:31:31.997 --> 00:31:36.105
that are in the water. So as the
boat sails through the water, it

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-6
00:31:36.105 --> 00:31:40.089
comes upon little rocks that it
has to kind of navigate across.

23cb1f09-b39e-4de6-9f09-7775d7439377-7
00:31:40.089 --> 00:31:41.769
In the distance we can see.

95f022d4-b053-47d0-b321-82691a509118-0
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.158
These white cone shaped
structures, I don't know if

95f022d4-b053-47d0-b321-82691a509118-1
00:31:46.158 --> 00:31:49.860
those are like mountains or
what, but it does have a little

95f022d4-b053-47d0-b321-82691a509118-2
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.747
bit of a black design on it, but
it's very bright. We can tell

95f022d4-b053-47d0-b321-82691a509118-3
00:31:53.747 --> 00:31:57.449
that's kind of in the back in
the boat. This little origami

95f022d4-b053-47d0-b321-82691a509118-4
00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:00.719
boat is just sailing through the
canal and The Cave.

514420f6-f791-4bb1-88ea-a0fce068f796-0
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.940
It looks like once to the other
side of the.

108965e2-0680-4336-988d-c71d10347a06-0
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:12.200
Water we see.

aff09a07-dde2-4b36-a881-63ef17151d3d-0
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.560
This.

e57d84bb-4e26-4127-ad62-28f1da76599c-0
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.100
It's this.

e78d2dc5-12c2-4ea8-8c11-8eee05b00ff7-0
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.400
Curved.

26fc894c-0577-4dcf-a5b7-19b6a5bd1da8-0
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.183
It kind of it's it's it's like a
spotlight because it's it's

26fc894c-0577-4dcf-a5b7-19b6a5bd1da8-1
00:32:27.183 --> 00:32:31.480
shining down and illuminating
this little origami boat and

26fc894c-0577-4dcf-a5b7-19b6a5bd1da8-2
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.520
it's kind of like a trumpet.

2fa554ce-3ffc-4dbb-907d-86dab944c77a-0
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:39.070
Shaped on the end, but then it
it attaches to something long

2fa554ce-3ffc-4dbb-907d-86dab944c77a-1
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.250
and thin and curvy and then next
picture we can see.

f680bec1-74d1-4921-9b30-0a04c4e14b94-0
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.800
That there is this.

6be2bd36-79b2-433d-9aa8-308d0771a169-0
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.618
Fish creature that had does have
two arms and two legs, but it

6be2bd36-79b2-433d-9aa8-308d0771a169-1
00:32:51.618 --> 00:32:52.260
does have.

845246a0-a3f1-4d90-a046-bb21c907a16b-0
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:58.298
Like tails for its its hands and
its feet and it's dressed in

845246a0-a3f1-4d90-a046-bb21c907a16b-1
00:32:58.298 --> 00:33:03.061
some kind of like scuba gear. It
has some kind of like a scuba

845246a0-a3f1-4d90-a046-bb21c907a16b-2
00:33:03.061 --> 00:33:07.749
helmet and tank on it and it
looks like these little trumpet.

54873eb7-306e-4395-9548-562a5952db2b-0
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:14.658
Lights are attached to the
helmets or the headgear from

54873eb7-306e-4395-9548-562a5952db2b-1
00:33:14.658 --> 00:33:15.860
this scuba.

93664c58-7349-45f4-b3d0-da84152f8345-0
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.819
From the scuba gear. Anyway,
this creature is holding the

93664c58-7349-45f4-b3d0-da84152f8345-1
00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:24.989
paper, the origami paper boat.
It picks it up and it's holding

93664c58-7349-45f4-b3d0-da84152f8345-2
00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:26.379
it and it's fin hand.

0ef60476-28af-42a7-b429-d6ca02c73467-0
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.340
All right, next we can see.

e2cade97-3732-421e-b901-e5392b115552-0
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.539
That the boat has traveled, it's
traveling through the water. We

e2cade97-3732-421e-b901-e5392b115552-1
00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:44.275
do still see one of these little
trumpet spotlights sticking up

e2cade97-3732-421e-b901-e5392b115552-2
00:33:44.275 --> 00:33:48.640
from the water, but the boat is
now next to these very two

e2cade97-3732-421e-b901-e5392b115552-3
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.154
large, two very large ships.
They look like industrial ships

e2cade97-3732-421e-b901-e5392b115552-4
00:33:53.154 --> 00:33:57.520
because you can see smokestacks
and there's all this smoke

e2cade97-3732-421e-b901-e5392b115552-5
00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.999
coming from the top.

27a2aba1-9901-43e9-916e-1df0c8beff47-0
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:04.456
There there's a few little
seagulls that are flying by and

27a2aba1-9901-43e9-916e-1df0c8beff47-1
00:34:04.456 --> 00:34:08.650
it looks like there's anchors
that come down. There's two

27a2aba1-9901-43e9-916e-1df0c8beff47-2
00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:13.134
anchors, one on each side of
each ship in the front part that

27a2aba1-9901-43e9-916e-1df0c8beff47-3
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:17.328
are they're up, but they can
come down. Almost looks like

27a2aba1-9901-43e9-916e-1df0c8beff47-4
00:34:17.328 --> 00:34:21.739
there's buildings on top of
these ships, they're so massive.

8b847447-2718-4772-9775-bc62fc83d9bc-0
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.800
It looks like now now we're back
to night time. We can see.

a8fa3e97-493b-4535-9afb-1706893abb97-0
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.023
This ship, this little origami
boat still sailing through the

a8fa3e97-493b-4535-9afb-1706893abb97-1
00:34:37.023 --> 00:34:38.980
water. It looks like there's.

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-0
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:47.939
It looks like there are seagulls
falling from the sky. I can't

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-1
00:34:47.939 --> 00:34:52.432
tell if they're dead or not, but
they are not. They're not flying

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-2
00:34:52.432 --> 00:34:56.381
down, they're actually falling
down from the sky. They're

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-3
00:34:56.381 --> 00:35:00.329
landing in the water. And
there's also some fish that are

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-4
00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:04.687
just kind of laying on the top
of the water as well. So I would

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-5
00:35:04.687 --> 00:35:08.704
imagine that they're dead,
probably from all of the smoke,

a0892bda-59b2-4798-9662-cb2a93a5ca5e-6
00:35:08.704 --> 00:35:12.040
because we also see these black
clouds of smoke.

eb147553-ad03-4673-b0a2-48e6e4c69bea-0
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.381
Um, that are coming from these
very very large shifts ships.

eb147553-ad03-4673-b0a2-48e6e4c69bea-1
00:35:16.381 --> 00:35:20.922
And so I'd imagine that the the
pollution is killing these birds

eb147553-ad03-4673-b0a2-48e6e4c69bea-2
00:35:20.922 --> 00:35:25.324
and these fish and they're just
kind of lying all over the top

eb147553-ad03-4673-b0a2-48e6e4c69bea-3
00:35:25.324 --> 00:35:29.446
of the the the water. It does
appear that there's one bird

eb147553-ad03-4673-b0a2-48e6e4c69bea-4
00:35:29.446 --> 00:35:32.590
that's kind of fallen into the
origami boat.

f6945ee8-ceed-4f64-abde-f89d5ac5cd93-0
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:40.876
And then we can see, oh, then
now we get closer to one of

f6945ee8-ceed-4f64-abde-f89d5ac5cd93-1
00:35:40.876 --> 00:35:45.940
these ships. We can see that
there are windows and there are.

25aa941d-dea8-4876-aae7-c171e3e50b34-0
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:52.262
We see 5 little windows and each
little window has some kind of a

25aa941d-dea8-4876-aae7-c171e3e50b34-1
00:35:52.262 --> 00:35:54.500
man creature that is shooting.

bfbbaaf0-aeb1-4a0f-991d-aedfb5cad36e-0
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.470
Out at the.

8566d049-e6ec-4bee-977e-24c62f44b4dc-0
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.401
I don't know if it's shooting
out at the boat or shooting out

8566d049-e6ec-4bee-977e-24c62f44b4dc-1
00:36:04.401 --> 00:36:08.407
at the the birds, but it's
shooting out some kind of fire

8566d049-e6ec-4bee-977e-24c62f44b4dc-2
00:36:08.407 --> 00:36:12.482
or gun or something. It does
create a little bit of smoke.

8566d049-e6ec-4bee-977e-24c62f44b4dc-3
00:36:12.482 --> 00:36:16.626
There is one man who actually
hits this little origami boat

8566d049-e6ec-4bee-977e-24c62f44b4dc-4
00:36:16.626 --> 00:36:20.908
and it goes right through the
paper. There also appears to be

8566d049-e6ec-4bee-977e-24c62f44b4dc-5
00:36:20.908 --> 00:36:22.979
one of these men is like on a.

be950ee1-cc6f-4750-9e8c-ca00f7a0d005-0
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.343
I don't know. He's on like a a
very small little like kayak

be950ee1-cc6f-4750-9e8c-ca00f7a0d005-1
00:36:30.343 --> 00:36:34.076
with the propeller maybe, and
they're kind of shooting at him

be950ee1-cc6f-4750-9e8c-ca00f7a0d005-2
00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:37.629
as well. Or maybe he's on a
rocket. Maybe it looks on this

be950ee1-cc6f-4750-9e8c-ca00f7a0d005-3
00:36:37.629 --> 00:36:40.460
page, it looks like it's a
rocket that he was.

8696180d-b209-4725-8e1e-018f0cba45e3-0
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.490
That he was kind of.

7d52dec5-2e04-417e-bfa3-0c46d270aa09-0
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.746
Navigating. He also has kind of
like a scuba gear on he's got a

7d52dec5-2e04-417e-bfa3-0c46d270aa09-1
00:36:49.746 --> 00:36:54.737
helmet, and each side of the
helmet has this weird little

7d52dec5-2e04-417e-bfa3-0c46d270aa09-2
00:36:54.737 --> 00:36:56.200
like, electrical.

9bdb2979-d0f8-4ba8-b172-54bdf2d0a02f-0
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.446
Flower that's kind of sticking
up out of his head, but it

9bdb2979-d0f8-4ba8-b172-54bdf2d0a02f-1
00:37:01.446 --> 00:37:05.050
illuminates so that he can see.
He's got like.

27aced10-870c-472b-86af-1792517b0b65-0
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.706
Looks like he has a tank on.
Anyway, he is now standing at

27aced10-870c-472b-86af-1792517b0b65-1
00:37:09.706 --> 00:37:13.318
the top on the top part of this
rocket and it looks like he's

27aced10-870c-472b-86af-1792517b0b65-2
00:37:13.318 --> 00:37:16.755
lit the rocket. You can see it
sparked on the back so it's

27aced10-870c-472b-86af-1792517b0b65-3
00:37:16.755 --> 00:37:20.308
probably going to shoot and this
is right next to the little

27aced10-870c-472b-86af-1792517b0b65-4
00:37:20.308 --> 00:37:23.745
origami boat that now has a
little bullet hole through it,

27aced10-870c-472b-86af-1792517b0b65-5
00:37:23.745 --> 00:37:26.250
but it does also have a buoy
inside of it.

7e92fce0-b105-4a73-9e8c-4fce66ef2610-0
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.550
And and we see.

81987842-3ff9-4f26-9629-7814af982b6f-0
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.453
See We now see this man in the
water and he is holding. He's

81987842-3ff9-4f26-9629-7814af982b6f-1
00:37:38.453 --> 00:37:44.174
got the buoy around him and his
his scuba tank and he's got the

81987842-3ff9-4f26-9629-7814af982b6f-2
00:37:44.174 --> 00:37:49.538
buoy attached to this little
paper boat and so he's holding

81987842-3ff9-4f26-9629-7814af982b6f-3
00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:55.170
on to the rope as it floats down
across the water. We also see

81987842-3ff9-4f26-9629-7814af982b6f-4
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.730
another ship come along, this
particular ship has.

bda45f91-cb58-4a5f-8a8b-090268557877-0
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.400
It's actually being led by the
the man. One of the first two

bda45f91-cb58-4a5f-8a8b-090268557877-1
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.260
men that we saw there was the
one that was dressed all black

bda45f91-cb58-4a5f-8a8b-090268557877-2
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.311
with the horns coming out. He is
actually riding on the top and

bda45f91-cb58-4a5f-8a8b-090268557877-3
00:38:12.311 --> 00:38:16.045
it looks like kind of the
captain of this weird ship. This

bda45f91-cb58-4a5f-8a8b-090268557877-4
00:38:16.045 --> 00:38:18.260
ship is kind of in the shape of
a.

f5301714-73dc-4696-9729-3403a8bf4a4f-0
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:25.451
Like a seashell, and there are
strange little creatures. We do

f5301714-73dc-4696-9729-3403a8bf4a4f-1
00:38:25.451 --> 00:38:29.840
see what looks like a cat. What
might look like?

be42524d-efc4-4745-ae64-b4d02807e7af-0
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.380
Umm.

2b7093d0-dff5-4c8c-b025-ad34cb3bf8d0-0
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.700
Like that Joker kind of a fish.
We see like a deer because we

2b7093d0-dff5-4c8c-b025-ad34cb3bf8d0-1
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:42.150
see antlers on it, but it has
like stars on it. We see a horse

2b7093d0-dff5-4c8c-b025-ad34cb3bf8d0-2
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.329
that is black, that has little
white specks.

61ac9a2f-ed7f-4ba0-bcd2-138de94a838c-0
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.440
Something else that has a black
and white checkered pattern.

cec6530a-81d9-4b78-8195-da936f654844-0
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.790
Two small little things that
kind of look like aliens.

0abdc9f7-1093-43d3-8a10-62e17c10b44c-0
00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.346
And and there's like a big kite
on the back part of this little

0abdc9f7-1093-43d3-8a10-62e17c10b44c-1
00:39:01.346 --> 00:39:05.675
ship that has stars on it as
well. And it is. It's coming

0abdc9f7-1093-43d3-8a10-62e17c10b44c-2
00:39:05.675 --> 00:39:09.930
towards this little boat with
the man in the scuba gear.

24373149-2a3c-4f19-9b40-1034515bcdfa-0
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:18.924
Oh wow. Now we see the boat and
it is in a wave. It's in a very,

24373149-2a3c-4f19-9b40-1034515bcdfa-1
00:39:18.924 --> 00:39:23.809
very big wave kind of on the the
underside. So it's going

24373149-2a3c-4f19-9b40-1034515bcdfa-2
00:39:23.809 --> 00:39:28.946
literally it's going up, Umm,
and the wave is about to crash

24373149-2a3c-4f19-9b40-1034515bcdfa-3
00:39:28.946 --> 00:39:34.252
down. But we do see the man in
his, the cat and the two little

24373149-2a3c-4f19-9b40-1034515bcdfa-4
00:39:34.252 --> 00:39:38.885
aliens in that little seashell
boat with all the other

24373149-2a3c-4f19-9b40-1034515bcdfa-5
00:39:38.885 --> 00:39:43.770
creatures now has this other man
that had the scuba gear.

af4a8564-6ced-416d-b036-9a58f2c65abb-0
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:48.626
With the scuba tank in the lit
up helmet he is now on the

af4a8564-6ced-416d-b036-9a58f2c65abb-1
00:39:48.626 --> 00:39:53.607
seashell ship and off of the
origami boat. And it looks like

af4a8564-6ced-416d-b036-9a58f2c65abb-2
00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:58.588
the man who was dressed in all
black has made a paper like a

af4a8564-6ced-416d-b036-9a58f2c65abb-3
00:39:58.588 --> 00:40:03.732
paper plane out of paper. And he
is standing on the top bar of

af4a8564-6ced-416d-b036-9a58f2c65abb-4
00:40:03.732 --> 00:40:08.386
the ship and he is about to
throw the plane towards this

af4a8564-6ced-416d-b036-9a58f2c65abb-5
00:40:08.386 --> 00:40:10.999
little origami boat in the wave.

060ff577-db4d-4225-bb93-a214a7b42a1c-0
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:20.545
And so next thing we can see,
the little origami boat it's

060ff577-db4d-4225-bb93-a214a7b42a1c-1
00:40:20.545 --> 00:40:23.390
sailing along the water, it's.

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-0
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.761
I would imagine it's very dark,
so it's hard to tell, but it

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-1
00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:33.361
looks like they're trees along
the sides. But you do see a

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-2
00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:36.778
little white, almost like a
lightning strike off in the

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-3
00:40:36.778 --> 00:40:40.561
distance in the background, in
the center of the picture. And

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-4
00:40:40.561 --> 00:40:44.466
then in the next picture, we see
this paper plane that that man

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-5
00:40:44.466 --> 00:40:48.431
who was dressed in black kind of
threw, and it's sailing through

160c2dfa-eb88-43ca-a436-203f49aec08f-6
00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:48.920
the air.

355848d6-5dc7-4704-84eb-dd501848fbaf-0
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:57.560
Then we see. Then we see a
picture of.

38c475dd-26b9-47e1-884d-df214a04b539-0
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:07.820
The Little boat sailing along
the water and it's come across.

329ed0f8-b7e6-48b2-84f5-2788dfcc71f0-0
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:12.432
Some kind of a sea snake or
creature, and it looks like

329ed0f8-b7e6-48b2-84f5-2788dfcc71f0-1
00:41:12.432 --> 00:41:16.453
there's multiple ones, but
they're curled up in the shape

329ed0f8-b7e6-48b2-84f5-2788dfcc71f0-2
00:41:16.453 --> 00:41:20.613
of Donuts. It looks like it's
traveling through these black

329ed0f8-b7e6-48b2-84f5-2788dfcc71f0-3
00:41:20.613 --> 00:41:24.634
doughnuts that have this black
and white vertical striped

329ed0f8-b7e6-48b2-84f5-2788dfcc71f0-4
00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:25.119
little.

71feb492-a234-4433-8ce6-a2974457ab18-0
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.370
Umm.

9cab2ad0-084f-4187-9b48-4771a3816df2-0
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.710
Little piece that kind of.

57ac5464-edfd-497f-97c7-459250b3e5e3-0
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.960
Goes around the end, but we do
see there's one of these little

57ac5464-edfd-497f-97c7-459250b3e5e3-1
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.331
snakes that has uncurled and is
standing up from the crowd and

57ac5464-edfd-497f-97c7-459250b3e5e3-2
00:41:39.331 --> 00:41:43.077
it has this paper plane in its
mouth. So it's kind of

57ac5464-edfd-497f-97c7-459250b3e5e3-3
00:41:43.077 --> 00:41:45.020
intercepted the paper plane.

3941e8e5-dace-4fbc-9893-1ff610bcc94b-0
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.630
Then on the we can see the.

2b13f569-3f78-4e2c-85ac-e31568ca0a82-0
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:57.142
The little origami boat travel
through the water and it goes

2b13f569-3f78-4e2c-85ac-e31568ca0a82-1
00:41:57.142 --> 00:41:57.420
to.

29af0bb2-1cc7-4a2f-8238-e3cc88c8708e-0
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.801
it goes inside of these little
sea creatures that look like

29af0bb2-1cc7-4a2f-8238-e3cc88c8708e-1
00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:07.710
Donuts, it's sailing through the
center part. But we do see the

29af0bb2-1cc7-4a2f-8238-e3cc88c8708e-2
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:12.312
one kind of uncurled and he is
kind of behind the water and

29af0bb2-1cc7-4a2f-8238-e3cc88c8708e-3
00:42:12.312 --> 00:42:17.144
then in the next behind the boat
in the water. And then in the

29af0bb2-1cc7-4a2f-8238-e3cc88c8708e-4
00:42:17.144 --> 00:42:21.899
next scene we can see it looks
like two more, although one of

29af0bb2-1cc7-4a2f-8238-e3cc88c8708e-5
00:42:21.899 --> 00:42:23.740
them has like a Unicorn.

d415abc9-2690-4424-ab61-37ebd72c1087-0
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:30.654
horn coming off of its head and
the other one has it very long,

d415abc9-2690-4424-ab61-37ebd72c1087-1
00:42:30.654 --> 00:42:31.170
spiky.

fd128e76-53a8-4659-bed0-4fb0286929d5-0
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:37.204
A trunk that hangs down, and so
as the boat exits, it's greeted

fd128e76-53a8-4659-bed0-4fb0286929d5-1
00:42:37.204 --> 00:42:38.830
by these two creatures.

847fd172-7d45-482e-9190-7440ebf0fca5-0
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.870
Alright, so now we see the boat
has exited. The.

e50a09f1-40c6-4392-9046-d91df3724434-0
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.406
The doughnut like creatures back
sailing through the water, it's

e50a09f1-40c6-4392-9046-d91df3724434-1
00:42:53.406 --> 00:42:55.450
it's going along this Unicorn.

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-0
00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:01.389
uh creature in this long trunk
creature in the Unicorn creature

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-1
00:43:01.389 --> 00:43:05.663
has two openings that are
spouting water and the boat is

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-2
00:43:05.663 --> 00:43:10.237
traveling under the water. So
the water is filling up in the

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-3
00:43:10.237 --> 00:43:14.886
boat that's coming out of this
creatures face and then on the

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-4
00:43:14.886 --> 00:43:19.611
other side we can see the boat
traveling in the water and then

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-5
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:23.960
a another sea or fish creature
it's it's like a it's like

0e79478b-6980-4350-9c99-42141afce59c-6
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.810
another Fishman has like a fish
head.

310dafa8-0972-496c-b957-af386ca6e22b-0
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:31.498
And it goes straight down into
two legs, but it has kind of

310dafa8-0972-496c-b957-af386ca6e22b-1
00:43:31.498 --> 00:43:36.413
webbed feet. It's got it's black
with white polka dots and it's

310dafa8-0972-496c-b957-af386ca6e22b-2
00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:41.021
got on like black and white
striped underwear, but also has

310dafa8-0972-496c-b957-af386ca6e22b-3
00:43:41.021 --> 00:43:42.250
two like webbed.

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-0
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.350
Fins or pieces off the side. Two
hang down real low. And then

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-1
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:52.009
there's two shorter ones that
kind of look like butterfly

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-2
00:43:52.009 --> 00:43:56.046
wings and he's standing on this
this grant that like the ground

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-3
00:43:56.046 --> 00:43:59.894
with trash you can see like a
beer bottles or soda cans. You

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-4
00:43:59.894 --> 00:44:03.489
can also see like little
propellers that are sticking up

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-5
00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:07.148
out of the ground and he is
standing there looking off at

121a84ea-9ade-4f47-888a-11af785508ad-6
00:44:07.148 --> 00:44:10.049
the origami boat traveling
through the water.

989b1592-638a-4d6a-bbf2-3aef3783dc2f-0
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:19.000
Then we can see that the boat
has, because it had water, has

989b1592-638a-4d6a-bbf2-3aef3783dc2f-1
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.580
kind of come below the.

645148f0-140f-4c1e-ae8c-f67b47c99523-0
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:26.113
Sea level. And there are I guess
these are supposed to be

645148f0-140f-4c1e-ae8c-f67b47c99523-1
00:44:26.113 --> 00:44:30.206
jellyfish. It's like, it's like
jellyfish but the tops are

645148f0-140f-4c1e-ae8c-f67b47c99523-2
00:44:30.206 --> 00:44:34.577
almost like a mushroom. So it's
like at the top has a mushroom

645148f0-140f-4c1e-ae8c-f67b47c99523-3
00:44:34.577 --> 00:44:39.017
with four little like a design
that has like 4 little petals on

645148f0-140f-4c1e-ae8c-f67b47c99523-4
00:44:39.017 --> 00:44:43.249
the top and then the bottom are
like jellyfish, they're like

645148f0-140f-4c1e-ae8c-f67b47c99523-5
00:44:43.249 --> 00:44:45.400
mushroom jellyfish and they're.

964839b6-4ade-42fe-a452-a2c6d19161d0-0
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.188
The boat is just kind of
traveling under the water down

964839b6-4ade-42fe-a452-a2c6d19161d0-1
00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:53.540
through this sea of jellyfish.

7d80ce82-b6d1-4ff6-8f92-c2dfc493edad-0
00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.970
Now we see it's.

edf97e6e-048f-475a-ba8e-54d25129aa60-0
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:04.180
It's very dark. We're still
under the water. We can see a

edf97e6e-048f-475a-ba8e-54d25129aa60-1
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.606
school of fish that the boat is
traveling right next to. We see

edf97e6e-048f-475a-ba8e-54d25129aa60-2
00:45:08.606 --> 00:45:11.580
another larger fish at the
bottom. We see.

6049bde3-b195-4752-b496-225142946158-0
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.150
Umm.

59b9238d-8f92-4145-9dae-51b3d807ca80-0
00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.547
Ohh, we actually see another
boat. So we now have two. {Is

59b9238d-8f92-4145-9dae-51b3d807ca80-1
00:45:18.547 --> 00:45:22.825
this one page or two? 2 pages.
Oh, OK, sorry. You just can't

59b9238d-8f92-4145-9dae-51b3d807ca80-2
00:45:22.825 --> 00:45:26.892
tell on it. OK, yes.} So and
then in the next one, we can

59b9238d-8f92-4145-9dae-51b3d807ca80-3
00:45:26.892 --> 00:45:31.240
kind of see the boat traveling.
There's another sea creature.

04e8e9b6-70ad-4195-85b6-27238b5ab906-0
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.222
I don't think that's an octopus.
It's like an octopus, but it has

04e8e9b6-70ad-4195-85b6-27238b5ab906-1
00:45:39.222 --> 00:45:42.206
webbing in between the
tentacles. And then there's

04e8e9b6-70ad-4195-85b6-27238b5ab906-2
00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:45.835
these little things. They look
like melons. They kind of look

04e8e9b6-70ad-4195-85b6-27238b5ab906-3
00:45:45.835 --> 00:45:46.829
like watermelons.

7951e618-8487-473e-ac1a-93ee980b3bfa-0
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.632
And they're kind of just
floating with some stars under

7951e618-8487-473e-ac1a-93ee980b3bfa-1
00:45:52.632 --> 00:45:56.609
the water and we see the boat
traveling by this like webbed

7951e618-8487-473e-ac1a-93ee980b3bfa-2
00:45:56.609 --> 00:45:57.140
octopus.

6564f619-58be-4f9f-a270-99f2a5636402-0
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.210
So now the now the boat has
landed on.

24ec22c4-1cd6-44ff-bc75-a5a177f0be83-0
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.358
Like a very long fish that's
it's long like a snake but it

24ec22c4-1cd6-44ff-bc75-a5a177f0be83-1
00:46:09.358 --> 00:46:14.173
definitely has a fish head and
we see a spotlight beam down and

24ec22c4-1cd6-44ff-bc75-a5a177f0be83-2
00:46:14.173 --> 00:46:18.988
the boat is on top of this snake
fish and there are these three

24ec22c4-1cd6-44ff-bc75-a5a177f0be83-3
00:46:18.988 --> 00:46:21.020
little creatures that have.

ac5b69c8-4272-470e-a5b7-d0b2651d36bf-0
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.429
Kind of climbed onto the boat.
There's one on the center part

ac5b69c8-4272-470e-a5b7-d0b2651d36bf-1
00:46:25.429 --> 00:46:29.048
of the boat. The other one is
inside the boat, and the third

ac5b69c8-4272-470e-a5b7-d0b2651d36bf-2
00:46:29.048 --> 00:46:32.906
one is trying to kind of get in.
And there they've got all these

ac5b69c8-4272-470e-a5b7-d0b2651d36bf-3
00:46:32.906 --> 00:46:36.704
little legs and they're kind of
crawling all over the boat. And

ac5b69c8-4272-470e-a5b7-d0b2651d36bf-4
00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:40.027
there's this beam of light
that's shining down over it,

ac5b69c8-4272-470e-a5b7-d0b2651d36bf-5
00:46:40.027 --> 00:46:41.570
often the distance we see.

7c694904-d2aa-4cfc-83c6-5e69d5cf56d0-0
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.183
Underwater, another black and
white checkered kind of

7c694904-d2aa-4cfc-83c6-5e69d5cf56d0-1
00:46:46.183 --> 00:46:50.208
submarine type boat and there
are these little fish that are

7c694904-d2aa-4cfc-83c6-5e69d5cf56d0-2
00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:54.035
surrounding that that have
little spotlights that they're

7c694904-d2aa-4cfc-83c6-5e69d5cf56d0-3
00:46:54.035 --> 00:46:58.060
either holding or coming off of
them and they're shining the

7c694904-d2aa-4cfc-83c6-5e69d5cf56d0-4
00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.369
spotlights through the dark
water.

0bdddae9-cb33-488f-8a77-f726a2d21b99-0
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.180
Alright, now we can see.

d92b413d-0da1-4559-a682-78f0d92ad9b2-0
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.350
We see that black and white.

c6103aa5-650c-43f7-994d-7c4b65514a0a-0
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.850
Uh.

15460722-a470-40a3-8ac7-5625915c635e-0
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:21.415
Like submarine ship that has a
it does have fins and a tail and

15460722-a470-40a3-8ac7-5625915c635e-1
00:47:21.415 --> 00:47:27.302
it has a school of fish that's
swimming underneath it, but it

15460722-a470-40a3-8ac7-5625915c635e-2
00:47:27.302 --> 00:47:33.377
is now angled so that the front
part of that is above the water

15460722-a470-40a3-8ac7-5625915c635e-3
00:47:33.377 --> 00:47:38.979
and it is facing another boat
that on the front part looks

15460722-a470-40a3-8ac7-5625915c635e-4
00:47:38.979 --> 00:47:44.485
like a boat has a couple of like
like smokestacks but the

15460722-a470-40a3-8ac7-5625915c635e-5
00:47:44.485 --> 00:47:45.340
backside.

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-0
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:49.637
Is definitely a fish. It also
has a tail and it has all these

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-1
00:47:49.637 --> 00:47:53.796
tentacles, long tentacles that
are coming out from the side.

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-2
00:47:53.796 --> 00:47:57.955
And so the two ships are kind of
facing one another. And the

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-3
00:47:57.955 --> 00:48:02.045
little origami boat, oh it's 2
pages, sorry, little origami

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-4
00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:06.000
boat is on the tip of this
submarine and it's pouring out

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-5
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.091
the water that was weighing it
down under the water. So the

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-6
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:14.318
submarine is kind of helped push
this little origami boat up,

945fa9a8-344d-4980-8c21-91bfc1ac5b61-7
00:48:14.318 --> 00:48:15.750
tipped out the water.

2eafa329-eb33-4f7c-812a-6c944c1d2966-0
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:20.067
And then in the next page we see
this other ship that has the

2eafa329-eb33-4f7c-812a-6c944c1d2966-1
00:48:20.067 --> 00:48:24.225
tail that's half fish with all
the tentacles, and the boat is

2eafa329-eb33-4f7c-812a-6c944c1d2966-2
00:48:24.225 --> 00:48:28.182
sailing past there. The little
origami boat is back on its

2eafa329-eb33-4f7c-812a-6c944c1d2966-3
00:48:28.182 --> 00:48:30.060
track and it's sailing past.

8310e14a-18be-4d13-a82a-29b4a560e312-0
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.470
All right, now we've got.

b6f14a87-7bd6-45cd-ba99-d4eb71759464-0
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.780
I guess this is.

8fa7b746-4d84-4ee7-b361-0dda11646ed1-0
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:39.810
Like.

13424869-2870-4df8-83d6-868d3d5227e0-0
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:42.900
Maybe walruses?

53ccdea2-9256-4b95-b504-803e7703f935-0
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:45.380
Or sea otters.

cd6b8287-0341-44c8-9e39-0fd61061c24c-0
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:50.246
Yeah, sea otters, maybe that
it's like a it's like a walrus

cd6b8287-0341-44c8-9e39-0fd61061c24c-1
00:48:50.246 --> 00:48:54.330
or sea Otter face, but they have
little web tails as well. I

cd6b8287-0341-44c8-9e39-0fd61061c24c-2
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.870
think it's a sea Otter.

346f6c69-b709-499b-83d8-a687a8418a02-0
00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:02.136
And we can see them playing
underwater, but they're also,

346f6c69-b709-499b-83d8-a687a8418a02-1
00:49:02.136 --> 00:49:07.317
there's a few, they're popping
their heads out from the water

346f6c69-b709-499b-83d8-a687a8418a02-2
00:49:07.317 --> 00:49:12.665
and one has a oh, it is, it's a
seal because he's got it on his

346f6c69-b709-499b-83d8-a687a8418a02-3
00:49:12.665 --> 00:49:17.929
nose. So he's balancing little
origami boat on his nose and we

346f6c69-b709-499b-83d8-a687a8418a02-4
00:49:17.929 --> 00:49:20.520
see clouds off in the distance.

bc106a9e-24a6-4884-a10c-9e82da70ae40-0
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.260
And the next page we see.

3cd2ebea-0a54-4e4a-9d5a-020503e9bb14-0
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.976
Clouds off in the distance and
underneath the sea level is a

3cd2ebea-0a54-4e4a-9d5a-020503e9bb14-1
00:49:29.976 --> 00:49:34.142
bunch of leaves, almost like
Fern style leaves. We do see a

3cd2ebea-0a54-4e4a-9d5a-020503e9bb14-2
00:49:34.142 --> 00:49:38.448
little bit of sea sea life, some
fish that are down there and

3cd2ebea-0a54-4e4a-9d5a-020503e9bb14-3
00:49:38.448 --> 00:49:42.684
then some other plants, some
coral and some other sea plants

3cd2ebea-0a54-4e4a-9d5a-020503e9bb14-4
00:49:42.684 --> 00:49:43.240
as well.

bccc883f-54d3-4e42-b14b-ac4dfd99a29c-0
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:51.302
Now we can see the little
origami boat making its way

bccc883f-54d3-4e42-b14b-ac4dfd99a29c-1
00:49:51.302 --> 00:49:53.770
above the the ferns and.

8e982816-89b6-47bb-ab96-fc6083245a36-0
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.280
We see more fish, we see some.

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-0
00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:04.862
I guess these are like zebra
fish. They have like black and

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-1
00:50:04.862 --> 00:50:09.450
white zebra stripes and they
have kind of a cool little face

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-2
00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:14.263
that has kind of a long narrow
nose. I guess some more. I guess

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-3
00:50:14.263 --> 00:50:18.399
those are kind of like the
jellyfish, like a different

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-4
00:50:18.399 --> 00:50:22.987
version of the jellyfish. But
yeah, we see more of those and

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-5
00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:27.499
the little boat is is sailing
above all of this and then in

afff17a8-79b6-47f2-bea5-98f409d539bf-6
00:50:27.499 --> 00:50:29.379
the next page we can see.

2621abda-b1c2-4d26-952c-a7658e710b56-0
00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:35.202
That the boat kind of tipped
down into the water a little

2621abda-b1c2-4d26-952c-a7658e710b56-1
00:50:35.202 --> 00:50:40.366
bit. There is a I guess that's a
fish. We do see one of the

2621abda-b1c2-4d26-952c-a7658e710b56-2
00:50:40.366 --> 00:50:45.359
little men dressed in it scuba
gear and a I think maybe a

2621abda-b1c2-4d26-952c-a7658e710b56-3
00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:48.629
striped seahorse or sea sea lion
and.

c3a1401b-3a79-435b-8ba1-d07d942c3a5e-0
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.320
They're holding this.

c089db16-97ef-4d68-bddd-d54cc66b7bd4-0
00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:56.048
It looks like an oyster and like
a Pearl, but the it's like lit

c089db16-97ef-4d68-bddd-d54cc66b7bd4-1
00:50:56.048 --> 00:50:59.986
up. The Pearl is like lit up, so
it's illuminating and it's got

c089db16-97ef-4d68-bddd-d54cc66b7bd4-2
00:50:59.986 --> 00:51:03.678
bubbles coming up from the man
from his scuba gear. And the

c089db16-97ef-4d68-bddd-d54cc66b7bd4-3
00:51:03.678 --> 00:51:07.309
bubbles are right coming up to
the surface right above the

c089db16-97ef-4d68-bddd-d54cc66b7bd4-4
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:08.540
little origami boat.

ddfa562d-18ca-48e4-94b7-60168eafaeaa-0
00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:18.405
Now we can see that striped sea
creature and the man with the

ddfa562d-18ca-48e4-94b7-60168eafaeaa-1
00:51:18.405 --> 00:51:23.298
scuba gear, he is riding that
striped sea creature. He's on

ddfa562d-18ca-48e4-94b7-60168eafaeaa-2
00:51:23.298 --> 00:51:28.680
top of the water, kind of behind
the boat. And there is a like a.

be7582d3-2a93-4237-ba5a-11a9bb83a092-0
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.850
Lighthouse.

a248acbf-9228-4fbe-bd53-83af1e87aa13-0
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:35.370
Um, but like when it's one of
the ones that kind of is?

930a33c9-4dc1-4247-93e5-098262065f64-0
00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.073
I guess kind of floats in the
water. It's black and it does

930a33c9-4dc1-4247-93e5-098262065f64-1
00:51:40.073 --> 00:51:43.576
have a white stripe. And there's
little fish, black fish painted

930a33c9-4dc1-4247-93e5-098262065f64-2
00:51:43.576 --> 00:51:46.971
on the white stripe. And then
there's a light bulb at the top.

930a33c9-4dc1-4247-93e5-098262065f64-3
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.366
There's a couple of seagulls up
at the top. One is standing on

930a33c9-4dc1-4247-93e5-098262065f64-4
00:51:50.366 --> 00:51:53.815
top of the light, and then there
are these other creatures that

930a33c9-4dc1-4247-93e5-098262065f64-5
00:51:53.815 --> 00:51:55.270
have two arms and two legs.

24244eae-6fb3-481f-821f-0ad5925fc6ee-0
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:59.293
I get they're different than the
Joker, but they have like 5

24244eae-6fb3-481f-821f-0ad5925fc6ee-1
00:51:59.293 --> 00:51:59.670
little.

a9217cc9-0c8a-45ff-815c-5ff5fa018a93-0
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.980
Umm.

f4b3bc1c-c461-4be0-8280-4b71693ac3bc-0
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.381
Kind of cone shaped pieces that
come out of their head and you

f4b3bc1c-c461-4be0-8280-4b71693ac3bc-1
00:52:05.381 --> 00:52:07.890
can see their eyes lit up. And
then we have another.

bbd6d5b1-16a3-45bd-bf24-15c3557299ad-0
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.735
Fish that has two arms and two
legs and a fish head and it's

bbd6d5b1-16a3-45bd-bf24-15c3557299ad-1
00:52:12.735 --> 00:52:14.810
kind of sitting on that as well.

097a922d-d793-4bbe-b2db-2518f21bdc36-0
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.970
And in the next picture we can
see.

e0daf8ef-ff26-4f23-9c94-020110e5665a-0
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:25.286
Some bigger ships. We can see
the smoke in the background of

e0daf8ef-ff26-4f23-9c94-020110e5665a-1
00:52:25.286 --> 00:52:29.235
that coming up from the bigger
ships. We do see a a real

e0daf8ef-ff26-4f23-9c94-020110e5665a-2
00:52:29.235 --> 00:52:33.600
lighthouse that's up on a rock,
a striped lighthouse. There is

e0daf8ef-ff26-4f23-9c94-020110e5665a-3
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.580
somebody stranded actually on
that little.

0c1ae83f-7d87-4076-a8ba-0f691204446a-0
00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.279
Piece of land that the
lighthouse is on and the boat is

0c1ae83f-7d87-4076-a8ba-0f691204446a-1
00:52:41.279 --> 00:52:43.760
sailing by the little origami
boat.

f9f678a3-c884-42d3-a2b5-f9532486dcdd-0
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.090
{Oh my goodness.

207129d4-1c98-42aa-8507-912463fc613e-0
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:56.039
It's just hard to describe these
things. Yeah. So now we have oh

207129d4-1c98-42aa-8507-912463fc613e-1
00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:56.540
boy.}

7847d564-c84a-43c2-8056-653a27491709-0
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.450
Now we see.

55446043-4491-4522-9a9a-eabe23e7c160-0
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.450
We see the little boat travel.

ce54f1ed-215d-44ac-8d40-939f796850e9-0
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:09.494
By there's there's the bigger
ships in the background with

ce54f1ed-215d-44ac-8d40-939f796850e9-1
00:53:09.494 --> 00:53:14.060
their with their smoke, but we
see the boat traveled by this.

7e0a7c2b-c201-4d36-a08f-06d029c52391-0
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:20.290
Like round building structure
and it has like.

16a70467-002c-4f5e-bf49-9562575c0681-0
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:25.148
Like a railing and there's
lights and you can walk along

16a70467-002c-4f5e-bf49-9562575c0681-1
00:53:25.148 --> 00:53:29.215
the balcony of it, but the
underside of it, and this is

16a70467-002c-4f5e-bf49-9562575c0681-2
00:53:29.215 --> 00:53:32.410
above water and below water is
it's like a.

4ec43bf5-85b5-4fe9-b412-ae399e21b82e-0
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:34.630
So I don't know what they call
it.

f9ce854d-21b2-4cca-badf-37f91d6d57ba-0
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.920
Kind of like a scaffolding type
of like it's, I can't tell if

f9ce854d-21b2-4cca-badf-37f91d6d57ba-1
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.031
it's wooden or metal, but almost
like a roller coaster, you know

f9ce854d-21b2-4cca-badf-37f91d6d57ba-2
00:53:44.031 --> 00:53:47.572
if you see a like a wooden
roller coaster and the under

f9ce854d-21b2-4cca-badf-37f91d6d57ba-3
00:53:47.572 --> 00:53:51.430
part of that roller coaster,
it's built just like that with.

2a6aefcf-f801-4d0f-ae94-2962dd65eebe-0
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.309
Like wooden wooden beams that
kind of crisscross and you can

2a6aefcf-f801-4d0f-ae94-2962dd65eebe-1
00:53:57.309 --> 00:54:01.123
see through it, it's you know
it's open air, it's not

2a6aefcf-f801-4d0f-ae94-2962dd65eebe-2
00:54:01.123 --> 00:54:05.574
completely solid and it's this
long massive structure. So it's

2a6aefcf-f801-4d0f-ae94-2962dd65eebe-3
00:54:05.574 --> 00:54:10.024
got like this round like Rotunda
type shaped building and then

2a6aefcf-f801-4d0f-ae94-2962dd65eebe-4
00:54:10.024 --> 00:54:10.590
there's.

c4c89c8f-0edd-4087-b77c-c8530f30674c-0
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.820
A pier.

5458e01a-c81e-4ff9-97b7-faa9e2862a00-0
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:17.997
That connects this, that we
can't even see what it connects

5458e01a-c81e-4ff9-97b7-faa9e2862a00-1
00:54:17.997 --> 00:54:22.315
to, but it goes all the way
across the water and we see some

5458e01a-c81e-4ff9-97b7-faa9e2862a00-2
00:54:22.315 --> 00:54:22.740
other.

25117ecc-1f11-4a06-a4ed-43660fa53210-0
00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:27.730
Medium sized ships that have a
bunch of smoke coming and

25117ecc-1f11-4a06-a4ed-43660fa53210-1
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:30.810
they're kind of passing along
this as well.

5ee95cc5-bdc6-420f-994c-d3239af9cab1-0
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.310
We can see now we see the.

09e04348-4eb7-4e08-8c6b-be51a7381c5c-0
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:44.463
The little origami boat floating
along the water, we can see the

09e04348-4eb7-4e08-8c6b-be51a7381c5c-1
00:54:44.463 --> 00:54:49.105
checkered submarine boat is
below the water and it's right

09e04348-4eb7-4e08-8c6b-be51a7381c5c-2
00:54:49.105 --> 00:54:54.140
along near one of these really
large massive ships that has one

09e04348-4eb7-4e08-8c6b-be51a7381c5c-3
00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:59.332
of those anchors on each side in
the front there's a smaller boat

09e04348-4eb7-4e08-8c6b-be51a7381c5c-4
00:54:59.332 --> 00:55:04.288
that's next to it as well, and
it's got like a little sailboat

09e04348-4eb7-4e08-8c6b-be51a7381c5c-5
00:55:04.288 --> 00:55:08.930
attached to this other boat,
this like little rescue boat.

59f76ed6-bf38-4d9d-bacc-fb3289aa5ffb-0
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:13.365
You do see a few fish and then
off in the distance on the other

59f76ed6-bf38-4d9d-bacc-fb3289aa5ffb-1
00:55:13.365 --> 00:55:17.274
side you see lots of smoke, but
you see what is like a little

59f76ed6-bf38-4d9d-bacc-fb3289aa5ffb-2
00:55:17.274 --> 00:55:20.742
city center because you can see
buildings and Um, it's

59f76ed6-bf38-4d9d-bacc-fb3289aa5ffb-3
00:55:20.742 --> 00:55:24.525
definitely some some kind of
shore shoreline with buildings

59f76ed6-bf38-4d9d-bacc-fb3289aa5ffb-4
00:55:24.525 --> 00:55:25.660
in the background.

4c6e1191-790a-4ad2-967b-459fbd7288f6-0
00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:34.117
So now we see. Now we see a lot
of the creatures we've seen

4c6e1191-790a-4ad2-967b-459fbd7288f6-1
00:55:34.117 --> 00:55:38.345
before. We see a small little
paddle boat that three people

4c6e1191-790a-4ad2-967b-459fbd7288f6-2
00:55:38.345 --> 00:55:40.600
are on. We see this like little.

66077553-73a1-43cc-9c8f-9844a69b0bb1-0
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.901
Lighthouse buoy type thing
that's off in the water we see

66077553-73a1-43cc-9c8f-9844a69b0bb1-1
00:55:46.901 --> 00:55:50.080
the large, the edge of the
large.

b4d6427b-d316-4f72-a66b-516f5026dfaf-0
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.270


c7c10e11-c138-4775-8477-d942bda4cb2e-0
00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:58.876
Is that the large ship or is
that I think it's, I think it's

c7c10e11-c138-4775-8477-d942bda4cb2e-1
00:55:58.876 --> 00:56:03.200
actually like a wall where we
see people waiting for the ships

c7c10e11-c138-4775-8477-d942bda4cb2e-2
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.456
to pull up to. But one of those
very large sea creatures that

c7c10e11-c138-4775-8477-d942bda4cb2e-3
00:56:07.456 --> 00:56:11.849
has the tail is kind of perched
on this wall at the edge of the

c7c10e11-c138-4775-8477-d942bda4cb2e-4
00:56:11.849 --> 00:56:15.898
wall. It's a very large sea
creature and he's got a little

c7c10e11-c138-4775-8477-d942bda4cb2e-5
00:56:15.898 --> 00:56:18.850
scuba tank on and off the scuba
tank is a.

37c0fbcf-86b2-4377-87f5-49fee3b713f6-0
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:25.910
Is this hose that kind of turns
and is pouring water on his

37c0fbcf-86b2-4377-87f5-49fee3b713f6-1
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:32.397
head. It's almost like a a a
shower head that's raining down

37c0fbcf-86b2-4377-87f5-49fee3b713f6-2
00:56:32.397 --> 00:56:33.780
water we see.

5a4c7a0b-1385-47a9-91b3-aa0abdd9ebe4-0
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.180
I think they're called.

59475737-052f-4067-b23a-812e1418a23d-0
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.700
Cherry pickers, the little.

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-0
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:44.390
Contraptions that lift people up
in little booths. And so it's

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-1
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:48.055
like a zigzag and you can go
along up along a building, I

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-2
00:56:48.055 --> 00:56:51.846
think it's called a cherry
picker. And then you can see the

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-3
00:56:51.846 --> 00:56:56.016
there's a ship on the other side
off in the distance with all the

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-4
00:56:56.016 --> 00:56:59.871
smoke coming from these. In the
next page we see this little

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-5
00:56:59.871 --> 00:57:03.220
origami boat and he's just
sailing around this wall.

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-6
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:07.327
There's a lot of people standing
on this. I guess it's a dock of

2d38bd7c-2851-44fc-bf17-1738760c4e19-7
00:57:07.327 --> 00:57:10.360
some sort because there's two
very large ships.

65564cff-4f18-4668-8631-fa319d8b4b74-0
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:15.723
One is called the Neuville
NEUVILLE that are kind of docked

65564cff-4f18-4668-8631-fa319d8b4b74-1
00:57:15.723 --> 00:57:20.996
and they're seagulls floating
and the people are standing and

65564cff-4f18-4668-8631-fa319d8b4b74-2
00:57:20.996 --> 00:57:26.354
looking up at these ships as a
little origami boat sails sails

65564cff-4f18-4668-8631-fa319d8b4b74-3
00:57:26.354 --> 00:57:26.610
by.

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-0
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:34.705
Then we see the little origami
boat go by, another boat,

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-1
00:57:34.705 --> 00:57:38.724
another small boat. There's a
man and a woman. It looks like

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-2
00:57:38.724 --> 00:57:42.810
there's a clothesline off the
center of the boat that they're

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-3
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:46.763
trying to hang clothes. And it
looks like there's also some

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-4
00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:50.848
kind of like an umbrella with
little flower petal design. And

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-5
00:57:50.848 --> 00:57:55.065
then in the background you can
see this dock with the ships and

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-6
00:57:55.065 --> 00:57:59.084
there's another couple other
ships, another ship with people

1979a2b2-da02-490d-994b-7ff9c149352f-7
00:57:59.084 --> 00:57:59.480
on it.

55c2efa8-42a9-443a-8867-f0698fe34b42-0
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.998
Then we get to next to this
wall, there's this ship that has

55c2efa8-42a9-443a-8867-f0698fe34b42-1
00:58:04.998 --> 00:58:10.217
a crane I guess. There's a bunch
of cranes off some of the ships

55c2efa8-42a9-443a-8867-f0698fe34b42-2
00:58:10.217 --> 00:58:14.795
in the background. They're must
be lifting freight. This

55c2efa8-42a9-443a-8867-f0698fe34b42-3
00:58:14.795 --> 00:58:19.452
particular one has a crane, but
instead of a freight or a

55c2efa8-42a9-443a-8867-f0698fe34b42-4
00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:24.110
freight box, it's lifting a.
It's like a seahorse with a.

78eeb68c-b232-45fe-a8fa-22b5f06c174d-0
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.176
Black and white checkered
pattern. And then the top part

78eeb68c-b232-45fe-a8fa-22b5f06c174d-1
00:58:30.176 --> 00:58:35.762
has a like a a scuba head, but
it's it's not and it's I don't

78eeb68c-b232-45fe-a8fa-22b5f06c174d-2
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:41.259
think it's an animal. There's
actually a little boy or a man

78eeb68c-b232-45fe-a8fa-22b5f06c174d-3
00:58:41.259 --> 00:58:47.026
that's inside this this the head
with like a captain's wheel on

78eeb68c-b232-45fe-a8fa-22b5f06c174d-4
00:58:47.026 --> 00:58:50.269
the inside of this. Oh my
goodness.

ea4df712-4992-4c34-99c6-d370c89fd668-0
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:53.910
{Strange.

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-0
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.615
Are we going to get through it?
Do I have a lot more? You're

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-1
00:58:59.615 --> 00:59:03.933
almost there.} OK, alright, so
now we've got a boat. Let's see,

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-2
00:59:03.933 --> 00:59:08.048
we've got a boat that has looks
like two dogs and a man. The

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-3
00:59:08.048 --> 00:59:11.961
little origami boat is sailing
by this, but this boat has

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-4
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:16.347
little crane. It's lifted a net
of a sea creature trapped in the

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-5
00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:20.327
net and it's lifted that out.
And then in the next picture

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-6
00:59:20.327 --> 00:59:24.038
again, we still see these
buildings in the background.

ba6882dd-aa20-4edf-9aba-3d3c37a1fb4b-7
00:59:24.038 --> 00:59:25.320
It's sailing along.

866fc71b-38c1-4fcc-b27f-82d8f4acc163-0
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.096
Another boat that has little
staircase that comes off the

866fc71b-38c1-4fcc-b27f-82d8f4acc163-1
00:59:29.096 --> 00:59:32.602
side and there's a a man
standing at the bottom of the

866fc71b-38c1-4fcc-b27f-82d8f4acc163-2
00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:33.240
staircase.

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-0
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.313
Now we can see it's traveling
through this little village, so

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-1
00:59:42.313 --> 00:59:46.372
it's like a little canal. The
water is, it's close to these

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-2
00:59:46.372 --> 00:59:50.362
buildings. It's traveling
through this little village. All

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-3
00:59:50.362 --> 00:59:54.353
the buildings are either like
black and white checkered or

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-4
00:59:54.353 --> 00:59:58.682
black and white striped. There
are these little arched gateways

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-5
00:59:58.682 --> 01:00:02.808
that the waterway leads under
and in through this village we

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-6
01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:06.393
can see black and white
checkered roofs. We see some

1626d1fd-8e71-4652-8b4e-ca5933f80035-7
01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:07.070
birds and.

c9ad25af-991c-4c5e-8c55-5a6f9f000570-0
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.329
It's there's another sea
creature that we've seen before

c9ad25af-991c-4c5e-8c55-5a6f9f000570-1
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:15.299
that's somehow off up. We, I
swear we see like a buck

c9ad25af-991c-4c5e-8c55-5a6f9f000570-2
01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:19.856
standing on top of a building
and it's dark out. So there's a

c9ad25af-991c-4c5e-8c55-5a6f9f000570-3
01:00:19.856 --> 01:00:24.046
lot of a lot of lights from
these buildings, windows and

c9ad25af-991c-4c5e-8c55-5a6f9f000570-4
01:00:24.046 --> 01:00:25.589
little things lit up.

3fe30c43-b1c7-4804-9994-e49fe6371526-0
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:33.868
And this little boat makes his
way along another staircase

3fe30c43-b1c7-4804-9994-e49fe6371526-1
01:00:33.868 --> 01:00:38.951
where we see the same little
like circus of the Joker Fish,

3fe30c43-b1c7-4804-9994-e49fe6371526-2
01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:44.120
the cat, the horse that's got
little poke, white polka dots,

3fe30c43-b1c7-4804-9994-e49fe6371526-3
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.457
the man that was wearing black
initially and the deer with the

3fe30c43-b1c7-4804-9994-e49fe6371526-4
01:00:49.457 --> 01:00:54.710
stars. They were all in that
seashell boat and he's traveling

3fe30c43-b1c7-4804-9994-e49fe6371526-5
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.320
past that and then.

47ca5c4b-2558-43bd-be35-d12f52eecc5b-0
01:00:56.410 --> 01:01:00.653
We see him with the black and
white striped seahorse creature.

47ca5c4b-2558-43bd-be35-d12f52eecc5b-1
01:01:00.653 --> 01:01:04.694
That man that was riding that
seahorse creature is actually

47ca5c4b-2558-43bd-be35-d12f52eecc5b-2
01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.849
stopped. He's sitting on a step.

09415945-0e0f-47d9-9006-ddb22a640d85-0
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.967
appears he's smoking a cigarette
that he has a cigarette in his

09415945-0e0f-47d9-9006-ddb22a640d85-1
01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:14.361
hand and he's got his scuba gear
off. He's got his tank in his

09415945-0e0f-47d9-9006-ddb22a640d85-2
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:17.808
helmet off and up the stairwell.
There's some Street lights and

09415945-0e0f-47d9-9006-ddb22a640d85-3
01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:21.256
some other people up there, but
the boat is sailing by all them

09415945-0e0f-47d9-9006-ddb22a640d85-4
01:01:21.256 --> 01:01:22.979
under this in this little canal.

bb7ea370-59b8-4ee2-8f65-0fd54422028e-0
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:31.594
And we see the fish that had
popped out of the water with

bb7ea370-59b8-4ee2-8f65-0fd54422028e-1
01:01:31.594 --> 01:01:36.236
their little eyes glowing. We
see that little submarine,

bb7ea370-59b8-4ee2-8f65-0fd54422028e-2
01:01:36.236 --> 01:01:41.286
checkered boat, and little boat
is just traveling through the

bb7ea370-59b8-4ee2-8f65-0fd54422028e-3
01:01:41.286 --> 01:01:46.336
water past all of these things,
out to the other side of this

bb7ea370-59b8-4ee2-8f65-0fd54422028e-4
01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:48.210
little cityscape canal.

1bae673c-7651-4173-a11d-32a6faccdc2d-0
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:56.794
Now we see the little boat
travel closer back into like a

1bae673c-7651-4173-a11d-32a6faccdc2d-1
01:01:56.794 --> 01:02:01.416
treed area. It's kind of away
from the city stars in the sky.

1bae673c-7651-4173-a11d-32a6faccdc2d-2
01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:05.965
There's a little structure that
has a very small little like

1bae673c-7651-4173-a11d-32a6faccdc2d-3
01:02:05.965 --> 01:02:10.587
house. It has one tall street
lamp and there is a light on in

1bae673c-7651-4173-a11d-32a6faccdc2d-4
01:02:10.587 --> 01:02:14.911
the house and it's heading
towards that area. Then we see

1bae673c-7651-4173-a11d-32a6faccdc2d-5
01:02:14.911 --> 01:02:19.460
the boat little origami boat
pull up next to like the brick.

b0542bd7-41bb-477c-8b64-2e18ab7bda52-0
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:26.000
Wall for this, and we can kind
of see a silhouette of.

9cf63f45-2ee2-466d-8b1d-ebc818773228-0
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:32.063
A man or some kind of creature.
And he actually begins to step

9cf63f45-2ee2-466d-8b1d-ebc818773228-1
01:02:32.063 --> 01:02:37.397
out of the origami boat and as
he steps out and onto the steps

9cf63f45-2ee2-466d-8b1d-ebc818773228-2
01:02:37.397 --> 01:02:42.730
of this structure, we see the
boat kind of fade away. And this

9cf63f45-2ee2-466d-8b1d-ebc818773228-3
01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:47.979
man is, he's he's all black and
he's got almost like pictures

9cf63f45-2ee2-466d-8b1d-ebc818773228-4
01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:53.228
like hieroglyphics, like white
hieroglyphics on his body, but

9cf63f45-2ee2-466d-8b1d-ebc818773228-5
01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:56.700
he does have a face, two arms,
two legs.

a4b6df3a-309f-4cc4-844b-eb14c894f428-0
01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:00.966
Two hands, two feet and then we
see at the top 2 white legs and

a4b6df3a-309f-4cc4-844b-eb14c894f428-1
01:03:00.966 --> 01:03:04.769
two feet. And then the final
picture we see the two black

a4b6df3a-309f-4cc4-844b-eb14c894f428-2
01:03:04.769 --> 01:03:08.768
legs and feet standing next to
and facing the two white legs

a4b6df3a-309f-4cc4-844b-eb14c894f428-3
01:03:08.768 --> 01:03:10.670
and their feet. #END_wanderer

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.770
That is all, thank you. Oh my
goodness, how crazy.
