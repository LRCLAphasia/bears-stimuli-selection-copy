00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:28.145
what is happening as thoroughly
as you can. Just imagine that

#START_unfriendly_giants Um,
this is another picture with

053ca432-54de-4c1c-b1d0-67404ba058c4-1
00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:55.600
lots of people and lots of
things going on.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.300
what appear to be giants.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.000
It's mostly male giants and then
there are very small people.

dff12dda-bc1a-44a4-b123-e571bf2d7fb6-0
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.090
And.

7ddac279-613d-45d2-9de0-f5abab25dfd3-0
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.311
Buildings. I see a very small
building that looks like an

7ddac279-613d-45d2-9de0-f5abab25dfd3-1
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.790
outhouse with a thatched roof.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.024
I see another building that's a
little bigger, maybe a home with

60f3396e-bf02-4693-8d07-06fc07113816-1
00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:36.301
a thatched roof and chickens on
top and a chimney in the middle

60f3396e-bf02-4693-8d07-06fc07113816-2
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.240
and a wooden door. 2 windows.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.230
There are two or three other
small.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.410
Residences. Then I see a
windmill.

461751c0-6d65-439e-ab5e-3a66bff2fd69-0
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.480
That's

cd9d2697-8f0b-4ed6-b27b-76f49c3890b6-0
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.611
With a giant next to it, it
looks like maybe he was spinning

cd9d2697-8f0b-4ed6-b27b-76f49c3890b6-1
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.404
the windmill. There's another
windmill in the distance.

cd9d2697-8f0b-4ed6-b27b-76f49c3890b6-2
00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:04.332
There's birds in the sky and
there's, oh, there's so many

cd9d2697-8f0b-4ed6-b27b-76f49c3890b6-3
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:08.599
giants. There must be 20 giants.
There's no way I can describe

cd9d2697-8f0b-4ed6-b27b-76f49c3890b6-4
00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.360
them all, but there's one.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.120
He's taller than a tree, and
there's people in the tree.

44d259b2-bf2f-4fec-8afa-d084e2498d4d-0
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.480

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.520
Red and yellow and green and
blue and there's a stone

a8c4b952-80bb-4bd8-8dd0-c99245f0f3e7-1
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.228
building. Well, that's a big
building, sort of like a castle.

a8c4b952-80bb-4bd8-8dd0-c99245f0f3e7-2
00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:30.100
There's little people on the top
of the castle.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.278
There's a giant behind the
castle with what looks like a

09512a37-4942-42e2-95e5-2937c3d10d93-1
00:02:37.278 --> 00:02:39.290
thatched roof on his head.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.100
Peering over the top of the
castle.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.110
There's a giant walking up the
hill, 2-3 giants walking up the

tucked into his belt behind his

River and.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.038
There's a house with a thatched
roof in the middle of the river,

9e678117-2573-448c-b242-313895cf07d8-1
00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:12.182
people on top, and a giant
putting a rope around that

9e678117-2573-448c-b242-313895cf07d8-2
00:03:12.182 --> 00:03:16.020

There is another giant on the
left.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.123
Looking at a woman that seems to
be made out of wood, she's

0f2849ac-af45-42ce-ac9c-c3f20c58762c-1
00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:25.620
waving.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.871
He has a hood, he has a belt, he
has a bracelet. They all have

42b6bb3a-5c23-4046-8ad4-ba606887485f-1
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:33.830
moccasins.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.764
There are a bunch of giants
playing checkers with people.

There is a what?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.035
Looks, I don't know, some kind
of wooden structure and there's

00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:59.750
a big mallet at the top. Looks
like it.

cfc6bade-7711-4c18-8928-c25997cf68e1-0
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.940
It's down in a while. I'm not
sure what it does. There's a

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.651
giant giving another wooden
woman a bouquet of flowers. He

Maybe it's a spray of water? I'm
not sure where it's coming from.

people on the deck of the ship.

3675ce27-522b-458a-9323-af5481d26154-0
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.320
And they seem to be looking out
toward the birds.

a030e6a3-9f46-448b-acb5-b1b43babe0dd-0
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.340
But they also see something else
in the sky.

d2cc607e-a0b6-4b70-ad7f-843a1329e934-0
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:58.540
Some bigger.

d65fd248-1249-4f46-bd54-d6c4c78bb3f4-0
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.373
Vehicles in the air and lots of
boats in the water. They're

d65fd248-1249-4f46-bd54-d6c4c78bb3f4-1
00:14:07.373 --> 00:14:12.090
coming in. I think they're
coming in for a landing and.

dba31167-2756-4517-88f5-a5b93701df21-0
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.826
Then on the next page, if they
get a little closer to land,

dba31167-2756-4517-88f5-a5b93701df21-1
00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:19.590
they see.

85e5da31-3a4a-4ad5-9c54-60a4dd7e6a58-0
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.030
Two large.

c343094b-4abf-4ca0-bfc8-02bd1d200c16-0
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.850
Sculptures.

5eef3360-ea7a-4f26-8aef-f8d32aa90d73-0
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.260
of People.

32e6bdf1-4a2c-4345-ac78-11a1902055b7-0
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.950
One in a cap in one.

dfca2b4b-7301-497b-956b-b02a9dc26a17-0
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:42.732
With the fez and the sculp of
the hands of the sculptures are

dfca2b4b-7301-497b-956b-b02a9dc26a17-1
00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:48.100
touching like they're shaking
hands, and below one is a

dfca2b4b-7301-497b-956b-b02a9dc26a17-2
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.235
suitcase and a fruit bowl and a
cup and a saucer and vapes, and

dfca2b4b-7301-497b-956b-b02a9dc26a17-3
00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:59.220
below the other is a teapot and
a triangular shape.

cd61bf3c-5bb9-4c08-ae5d-3eb5362f06d2-0
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.610
Another tugboat maybe going by.

095bd9b6-394c-465b-80fd-4bfee376df55-0
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.730
Yeah.

2136cc97-1346-4860-b357-b2cc29ba8d0a-0
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.150
Next page.

28992734-f51c-4f45-a897-f65236acd862-0
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.190
And now we see the ship.

80bfc81c-344c-4461-807b-ac5059ce97af-0
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.406
From the front as it's coming
into shore, you can still see

80bfc81c-344c-4461-807b-ac5059ce97af-1
00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:24.051
those white birds, we can see
that tug boat right next to it.

80bfc81c-344c-4461-807b-ac5059ce97af-2
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:28.622
hope they don't hit and we can
still see those big clouds in

80bfc81c-344c-4461-807b-ac5059ce97af-3
00:15:28.622 --> 00:15:33.343
the sky, but there's some sun
coming through the clouds on the

80bfc81c-344c-4461-807b-ac5059ce97af-4
00:15:33.343 --> 00:15:37.690
next page. We're getting a
better look at the people who.

5c8c9e42-bd1d-4401-9329-e8e786b17b12-0
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.920
Seem to be getting ready to
disembark.

ac6e26eb-8b94-4ef9-8980-7f41f3bd2e00-0
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.770
Umm.

01416f2a-4a00-4b5e-a7c3-b60d2c7f5cec-0
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.653
There's a man with a bullhorn
and a hat kind of running the

01416f2a-4a00-4b5e-a7c3-b60d2c7f5cec-1
00:15:49.653 --> 00:15:53.670
show, maybe saying go this way,
and there's people.

27864ca5-9254-4fee-be3c-faf4b67c1c6b-0
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.986
Helping pull the luggage with
ropes and other people just

27864ca5-9254-4fee-be3c-faf4b67c1c6b-1
00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:06.227
carrying their own suitcases and
the families are kind of being

27864ca5-9254-4fee-be3c-faf4b67c1c6b-2
00:16:06.227 --> 00:16:08.470
pushed along, you know?

1ae9be6b-94a5-4595-86c6-5cf008a3f1fb-0
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.491
#END_arrival-2 Crowd. They're
not moving at the moment,

1ae9be6b-94a5-4595-86c6-5cf008a3f1fb-1
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:16.120
they're just waiting. They still
have their scarves on their

1ae9be6b-94a5-4595-86c6-5cf008a3f1fb-2
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.392
heads and their hats, and
they're ready to get off the

1ae9be6b-94a5-4595-86c6-5cf008a3f1fb-3
00:16:19.392 --> 00:16:19.690
ship.

80c67dba-7e7c-46f8-916a-e3002f574545-0
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.180
Well.

e43310ff-25e1-4d57-ad22-d82a1b08085f-0
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.800
{DATA MISSING, IMAGES NOT IN

e43310ff-25e1-4d57-ad22-d82a1b08085f-1
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.750
entered all those people.

01c63e9c-9275-406a-b95b-7b3659774cde-0
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.511
The same people or different
people? If it's the same people,

01c63e9c-9275-406a-b95b-7b3659774cde-1
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.820
they've now entered a large hall

457fb92a-0962-4db9-955c-17cbffd5b510-0
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.020
With rows of.

9bc07c0b-78b8-4c0e-a937-ffc2c6412e83-0
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:04.232
I don't think it's rows of seats
just rows for them to stand

9bc07c0b-78b8-4c0e-a937-ffc2c6412e83-1
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:09.501
there are there are balconies.
There's not many people, if any,

9bc07c0b-78b8-4c0e-a937-ffc2c6412e83-2
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:11.559

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:19.122
A very tall ceiling out the a
large window you can see some

ac85c42b-61b4-49ca-b60a-f836e5b2b0e3-1
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.090
buildings that are.

732bbdec-0ba6-483a-9b76-62ff75ca26ba-0
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.130
Shaped like cylinders and
there's some bubbles in the air.

1cab9385-c28e-4a2d-8da9-cef9cfc06fab-0
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.368
Um, we have some close-ups of
people. Oh, they seem to be.

1cab9385-c28e-4a2d-8da9-cef9cfc06fab-1
00:17:32.368 --> 00:17:35.550
They're being checked out one at
a time.

b953f6f4-86e3-4b66-9d23-db099ad806a7-0
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.090
Someone is checking their name
off a list.

6ffb2f62-f40f-4e16-8deb-342a6b9300e7-0
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.680
And then someone else is pinning
a.

45049b1c-97da-4eed-976d-a5f7211cff48-0
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:52.242
Name tag on them or some kind of
identifier. Someone else, maybe

45049b1c-97da-4eed-976d-a5f7211cff48-1
00:17:52.242 --> 00:17:57.800
a doctor, is checking their eyes
and their ears.

4e487bab-0d1e-4e12-95d1-1fa458904969-0
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.381
And their mouths was opening
their mouth really wide. You can

4e487bab-0d1e-4e12-95d1-1fa458904969-1
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:06.450
see the teeth and the tongue.

fe143342-753a-4cbf-b3e9-110fe2f86da3-0
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.378
And they're putting a symbol.
Everyone gets a different

fe143342-753a-4cbf-b3e9-110fe2f86da3-1
00:18:11.378 --> 00:18:11.900
symbol.

0961a588-6a71-40e2-be9d-817c4edb8590-0
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.220
And they're checking their
heart.

c4a80fc9-46e8-4a91-a79a-b260c43957dc-0
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:25.052
And they're showing them some
writings {and I can't quite see

c4a80fc9-46e8-4a91-a79a-b260c43957dc-1
00:18:25.052 --> 00:18:28.800
the last couple because I see
you're in front of it.}

32185a03-59d9-4687-9c4d-140bda192db5-0
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.590
{I don't know how you can move
yourself.}

c7581c0e-82f7-4c8e-8e9c-348a3e53c9dd-0
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.557
{Here, here we go. There I moved
the book.} And so there's still

c7581c0e-82f7-4c8e-8e9c-348a3e53c9dd-1
00:18:38.557 --> 00:18:41.540
some different the last one
there's a man.

af955bad-14b6-44b3-9b00-6a1f289ffebc-0
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.790
Holding his hat. Maybe he has a
child nearby. He looks worried.

85d8623a-416a-430b-a58c-e7b9b98c6090-0
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.140
OK. OK.

33bd55fb-a193-45d0-a4d8-5de1b3e6464c-0
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.490
Now we're focused on this one.

617f533f-99d6-48cb-97af-f0479da7ada5-0
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.905
Gentleman who seems to be
worried. He's got a lot of

617f533f-99d6-48cb-97af-f0479da7ada5-1
00:19:03.905 --> 00:19:04.690
different.

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-0
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.740
Tags on him, identifiers, and he
looks like he's talking to

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-1
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.607
someone and he can't hear what
they're saying or he can't

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-2
00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:17.674
understand what they're saying
because he has his hand up to

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-3
00:19:17.674 --> 00:19:21.541
his ear and his brow was
wrinkled and he's scratching his

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-4
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:25.875
head and he looks very worried.
He's trying to explain something

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-5
00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:29.942
and he's using his hands. He
puts two hands out, like really

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-6
00:19:29.942 --> 00:19:34.009
don't understand. He puts two
hands up like please listen to

56d9bd8c-e334-4a4c-b2e4-c4c371d30778-7
00:19:34.009 --> 00:19:36.609
me. And then he holds up a
picture of.

64e0c16e-bdf8-4133-b143-779d0862090e-0
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.900
his family

67067407-feab-46da-b82e-94791aeef97d-0
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.525
But it doesn't seem he's being
understood and he gets more

67067407-feab-46da-b82e-94791aeef97d-1
00:19:44.525 --> 00:19:45.510
bothered and.

e654e94f-9b23-4e8a-adc4-fb3fd45b4b02-0
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.657
He holds us, scratches his head
and holds his hand up to his

e654e94f-9b23-4e8a-adc4-fb3fd45b4b02-1
00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:54.540
forehead, and we're not sure
what's going to happen to him.

ccbc7aff-89f4-4c79-b67b-62b6931734f1-0
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.029
Not sure what we're looking at.
Maybe it's the man across from

ccbc7aff-89f4-4c79-b67b-62b6931734f1-1
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:07.258
him looking through the files
trying to find what he needs and

ccbc7aff-89f4-4c79-b67b-62b6931734f1-2
00:20:07.258 --> 00:20:12.238
typing on an unusual sort of
typewriter and puts maybe what

ccbc7aff-89f4-4c79-b67b-62b6931734f1-3
00:20:12.238 --> 00:20:15.060
looks like the man's passport
in.

2a584498-9a2f-44b9-87d8-1917b53fbe7d-0
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:25.120
He's getting ready to stamp it,
grabs his stamper and stamps his

2a584498-9a2f-44b9-87d8-1917b53fbe7d-1
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.400
passport.

e9e11e0b-bcc3-4064-aca5-25f788dd9bc2-0
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.560
And.

abf84cbd-2e56-4019-a8d9-37ecb56f47d0-0
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.220
Now he's just looking at it
while he.

1b7bae25-c27c-4e79-909a-d96436f42d14-0
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.670
Moistens something and.

1a740dff-162a-48d8-a04c-2eaed4bfd79a-0
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.873
Now he's going to write on it.
You can only see his arms, his

1a740dff-162a-48d8-a04c-2eaed4bfd79a-1
00:20:42.873 --> 00:20:47.129
sleeves. Ohh different people.
Yeah. First the first first

1a740dff-162a-48d8-a04c-2eaed4bfd79a-2
00:20:47.129 --> 00:20:51.674
person sleeves. Yeah, that was
the the man that was typing had

1a740dff-162a-48d8-a04c-2eaed4bfd79a-3
00:20:51.674 --> 00:20:56.147
triangles on his sleeves. The
man that stamped it had stripes

1a740dff-162a-48d8-a04c-2eaed4bfd79a-4
00:20:56.147 --> 00:20:58.240
on his sleeves. The man that.

e0c01ca9-8632-4b6d-9e8a-a00f0aa33734-0
00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.682
Right. That wrote on it had
polka dots on his sleeves. And

e0c01ca9-8632-4b6d-9e8a-a00f0aa33734-1
00:21:04.682 --> 00:21:08.916
now, finally, there's another
man who's looking at it,

e0c01ca9-8632-4b6d-9e8a-a00f0aa33734-2
00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:09.840
studying it.

ceb30502-3f96-4e3f-9db9-abbf9318bbd0-0
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.320
And.

a7cc4323-27dc-4412-bc6e-ec307a2d921c-0
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.040
It's going to put another stamp
on it.

3d322f4e-34dd-41b7-bbc5-8e644d2d1193-0
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.970
With those little things are
quite little.

0952047e-758d-47d1-8226-95bcd45d2712-0
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.290
Funnels,but I don't know. I
don't know what.

96075e45-383c-4f2f-85a6-628861cd4c81-0
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.491
So now his passport is stamped.
He still looks worried. He he

96075e45-383c-4f2f-85a6-628861cd4c81-1
00:21:34.491 --> 00:21:39.389
may not be with his family,
still he's. But his passport is

96075e45-383c-4f2f-85a6-628861cd4c81-2
00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:44.613
stamped and he folds it up and
puts it in his pocket, folds his

96075e45-383c-4f2f-85a6-628861cd4c81-3
00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:45.430
hands and.

78f14d0c-4d85-429f-85d3-73c08355f831-0
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.475
Looks rather sad and we're
looking at them through a little

78f14d0c-4d85-429f-85d3-73c08355f831-1
00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:56.730
window which is part of a little
box which is now.

c61b56b0-d825-4efd-a992-be4a7f41df5c-0
00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:03.353
Being pulled by a tea ball up
into this ohh by a balloon up

c61b56b0-d825-4efd-a992-be4a7f41df5c-1
00:22:03.353 --> 00:22:05.020
into the sky. Oh.

d306ce1e-7a96-48da-87e5-0c4042403ccf-0
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.170
Ohh, that's what those were.
They weren't. They were all

d306ce1e-7a96-48da-87e5-0c4042403ccf-1
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.050
balloons. It's all the people
who.

162e4632-6fcd-41c5-8050-6d86ebd63f69-0
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.230
OK, attached to all those
balloons are people who.

fee1e00d-a408-4979-a1b8-81b68fa8ac6d-0
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.360
Didn't get the right identifier
I guess.

a7c7816b-80d8-47e5-911f-5839b063c4ea-0
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.930
Below, some beautiful buildings.

33b53aa0-ca8c-4765-8383-efc5000dddd8-0
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.900
Those upside down cylinders, but
also some beautiful.

4ac7421d-018f-4217-a571-b4cca3e7cd90-0
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.370
Disc.

1054c478-9983-4936-9981-57100f774ad1-0
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.800
Buildings with domes. Gold
domes. Don't know what else to

1054c478-9983-4936-9981-57100f774ad1-1
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.900
say about that.

2e2c796e-e165-44f0-a701-40f9ba6d2984-0
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.310
OK, so is this where they went?
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe they

2e2c796e-e165-44f0-a701-40f9ba6d2984-1
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.131
did have the right identifier.
They went to this beautiful

2e2c796e-e165-44f0-a701-40f9ba6d2984-2
00:22:54.131 --> 00:22:54.520
place.

7f0f51e4-7830-4dc9-8b24-f0d0105de7d1-0
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.800
More buildings with domes and
pointed.

f419a83a-3414-412c-b2b1-d07a7de66ca0-0
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:11.174
Roofs. We only see one of those
balloons flying through the sky.

f419a83a-3414-412c-b2b1-d07a7de66ca0-1
00:23:11.174 --> 00:23:13.850
The clouds are thin now.

b2abb772-bb43-470f-93f5-94b76d6c1aaf-0
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.710
Flying over this.

4fa8df3e-f5ff-4b0f-9eaa-aa03a7f7512e-0
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.500
Maybe it's city.

aeabe837-8d36-4552-89d6-2510e67757d7-0
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.990
Um, we see boats, we see.

2368d97e-47ce-43e9-89b6-7f7ec72e0612-0
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.650
a few people.

90a78ab5-5a38-437a-bc6d-92c5121ee125-0
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.950
on this Highway, maybe?

870d39e1-0678-4f0d-a114-d67171499905-0
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.680
But I don't know what's on the
highway.

39069292-f4c2-48aa-af9d-ba94674a6d2c-0
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.050
Really know if there's some kind
of vehicles maybe?

cc31681b-b205-4670-86b7-9039295852a2-0
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.310
There's smoke coming out of a
smokestack.

ef72354a-30bd-4674-af97-a62244afc113-0
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.088
there is maybe little city in
the background with little

ef72354a-30bd-4674-af97-a62244afc113-1
00:23:50.088 --> 00:23:55.122
houses, but these houses we're
looking at here are very large

ef72354a-30bd-4674-af97-a62244afc113-2
00:23:55.122 --> 00:23:59.832
and there seem to be made of
stone and the biggest one of

ef72354a-30bd-4674-af97-a62244afc113-3
00:23:59.832 --> 00:24:04.947
all. And it's not a building,
it's just a big statue, maybe is

ef72354a-30bd-4674-af97-a62244afc113-4
00:24:04.947 --> 00:24:05.110
a.

9ab8c2f3-e48f-4e93-8928-e935fce4968d-0
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.022
bird its got 2 huge wings and
it's head sort of becomes a beak

9ab8c2f3-e48f-4e93-8928-e935fce4968d-1
00:24:11.022 --> 00:24:15.394
and it's holding a large egg.
{That's about all I have to say.

9ab8c2f3-e48f-4e93-8928-e935fce4968d-2
00:24:15.394 --> 00:24:17.129
All right, that's great.}

7125b240-f95c-4902-b1e4-a50220bb8664-0
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.660
Well, you see a bunch of little
rodents.

fe14a728-edf5-4e51-bed0-7f4fb4a054d9-0
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.975
Maybe eating something off the
ground and then they pick up

fe14a728-edf5-4e51-bed0-7f4fb4a054d9-1
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:37.830
their heads.

83b9b0b1-5934-4180-a50a-53287ba0934a-0
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.400
We're moving a little bit away
from them as we see that.

a4ceed73-34ca-4c4a-ab8c-bc48108b65db-0
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.560
What I call that before little
looks like?

0fb65827-c5cd-4e37-8c09-12cd5c96b658-0
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.700
Little looks like a telephone
booth really being dropped.

e2fcf5c6-9375-49a2-b42a-2adaad243097-0
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.972
Once it hits the ground, the
door opens and outcomes that man

e2fcf5c6-9375-49a2-b42a-2adaad243097-1
00:25:01.972 --> 00:25:02.320
that.

92d77bd9-3d49-4d4a-88da-55f01ae7d18b-0
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:07.628
Was worried before and he's
looking around. Ohh he takes the

92d77bd9-3d49-4d4a-88da-55f01ae7d18b-1
00:25:07.628 --> 00:25:09.280
time to close the door.

a0e2de3f-46d2-4261-a70a-8c5a2be9181c-0
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.730
How about that?

bd97fcf5-6bab-4319-9aef-553a9cc9c978-0
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.970
has a suitcase and he's walking
toward.

ffe60abe-a046-484d-862a-6be3a315a48b-0
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.360
This.

59fd1872-5beb-4b32-911b-aeb0b8a20aa1-0
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.440
Downtown, where there are other
people.

3c78da0b-5370-41b5-ac02-7a64b9fa1e22-0
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.300
Just like him. A lot of them.

be4fc468-9a1e-4954-aef6-feac7bc66a72-0
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.449
Maybe. Maybe they were brought
by all those balloons. He's the

be4fc468-9a1e-4954-aef6-feac7bc66a72-1
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:37.319
only one that has a suitcase. He
looks like the only newcomer.

be4fc468-9a1e-4954-aef6-feac7bc66a72-2
00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:41.066
Oh, but there's another one
coming. Unless that's the one he

be4fc468-9a1e-4954-aef6-feac7bc66a72-3
00:25:41.066 --> 00:25:44.935
just got out of. Yeah, that's
probably the one he just got out

be4fc468-9a1e-4954-aef6-feac7bc66a72-4
00:25:44.935 --> 00:25:45.120
of.

96afd828-b6b5-43a4-88c5-b617143637b0-0
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.840
There's a car, there's 2 2 cars,
very.

2ec52f12-9c80-45ca-9840-452c0639f55c-0
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.170
Unusual cars there's.

33898604-39d5-4865-b5bd-2b0b77d3874a-0
00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.066
I don't know. It's just not. I
don't know what more to say

33898604-39d5-4865-b5bd-2b0b77d3874a-1
00:26:00.066 --> 00:26:03.270
about that. We can move on,
doesn't it? But ohh.

7ee57436-87fc-4143-9ab3-011dac6bbd69-0
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.320
OK, I imagine these are all the
things the man is seeing.

8f7b4922-30d6-402f-9e5e-e25972775f7d-0
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:19.620
As he walks through this little
town, he sees a boy.

54a8e88b-0c5f-4bbc-bd83-31dec08f0ab9-0
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.795
With what looked like newspapers
under his arm, he's wearing his

54a8e88b-0c5f-4bbc-bd83-31dec08f0ab9-1
00:26:26.795 --> 00:26:30.306
cap and he's holding a
billboard. Probably says

54a8e88b-0c5f-4bbc-bd83-31dec08f0ab9-2
00:26:30.306 --> 00:26:31.770
newspapers for sale.

cd3f8d8d-59c2-404c-82e0-a427c7a004ad-0
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.910
And we see a woman holding up.

8a6b2910-2751-4efc-b677-cbea39d1655b-0
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.170
Unusual cat.

7efd9b0d-faa1-44ac-b1bd-6292a6eeac84-0
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.280
Talking to another woman and we
see a man.

67869c06-31a3-4443-9b5b-40f2aa6ee23a-0
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:52.567
Selling some sort of food from
his food truck. He has an

67869c06-31a3-4443-9b5b-40f2aa6ee23a-1
00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:58.757
unusual what looks like a lizard
in a basket on the front of his

67869c06-31a3-4443-9b5b-40f2aa6ee23a-2
00:26:58.757 --> 00:27:04.375
food truck. It has four small
wooden wheels and looks like

67869c06-31a3-4443-9b5b-40f2aa6ee23a-3
00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:06.470
it's hot food because.

ef90112f-fab0-4354-bed4-ed6582788c12-0
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.200
Sort of steam coming out of the
top of a.

b7216aac-bd9b-4eda-8f06-11e39da02421-0
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.180
Pipe.

d9f6fa04-da80-45d8-aaf1-f6d60deddfcc-0
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:21.894
And he sees, well, sees someone
with a crate with two huge eggs

d9f6fa04-da80-45d8-aaf1-f6d60deddfcc-1
00:27:21.894 --> 00:27:26.969
in it. I mean they would could
be dinosaur eggs, but they've

d9f6fa04-da80-45d8-aaf1-f6d60deddfcc-2
00:27:26.969 --> 00:27:32.044
got there's a man and a woman,
they've got two more and they

d9f6fa04-da80-45d8-aaf1-f6d60deddfcc-3
00:27:32.044 --> 00:27:34.539
are not going to fit in there.

639a0c6d-6e9e-4556-a499-7d347f0ead34-0
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.245
And let me walk so long and he
sees someone getting a shave.

639a0c6d-6e9e-4556-a499-7d347f0ead34-1
00:27:41.245 --> 00:27:46.749
Must be a Barber shop. Someone's
getting a shave. And there's a

639a0c6d-6e9e-4556-a499-7d347f0ead34-2
00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:51.822
small boy, everyone has caps.
Small boy behind, maybe he's

639a0c6d-6e9e-4556-a499-7d347f0ead34-3
00:27:51.822 --> 00:27:56.982
waiting his turn on the floor
are some nails are very large

639a0c6d-6e9e-4556-a499-7d347f0ead34-4
00:27:56.982 --> 00:28:00.250
snails. And then we see a man
with a.

ef73ae8c-5cde-4f62-abc7-c7e469ed26a3-0
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:03.920
Well.

f3a1e53d-a829-4b7a-9c88-f2092900f0c9-0
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.787
An accordion, but it's got a
huge attachment, like a horn,

f3a1e53d-a829-4b7a-9c88-f2092900f0c9-1
00:28:09.787 --> 00:28:15.077
and there's another man he's
sitting and another man playing

f3a1e53d-a829-4b7a-9c88-f2092900f0c9-2
00:28:15.077 --> 00:28:18.200
a violin and there's a music
stand.

e65982db-f6cc-4462-9940-3610a9357d04-0
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.910
Those rodents are look like
they've moved over.

71309e0e-d07e-4f16-8f66-ce3be5b48f97-0
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.570
There and then there's a bunch
of.

f6601a37-f2a3-4246-8666-96d4b70bf2a4-0
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:30.840
Women.

03ba1a3c-db75-45b6-a68c-c2e9fe9322c6-0
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.110
Sitting down.

e9266c18-ee0d-4373-b407-73e0db9db088-0
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:40.087
Just looking at a magazine or
newspaper, one of them is and

e9266c18-ee0d-4373-b407-73e0db9db088-1
00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:41.290
the other is.

4b7ac1fd-3606-490a-b545-4cfbb95f66ad-0
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:47.498
Making something, maybe knitting
and another one just looking,

4b7ac1fd-3606-490a-b545-4cfbb95f66ad-1
00:28:47.498 --> 00:28:52.129
holding her rabbit and just two
more in the background. And then

4b7ac1fd-3606-490a-b545-4cfbb95f66ad-2
00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:56.475
the man is just taking all of
this and he can't quite figure

4b7ac1fd-3606-490a-b545-4cfbb95f66ad-3
00:28:56.475 --> 00:29:00.821
out where he is or what he needs
to do. There's a boy with a

4b7ac1fd-3606-490a-b545-4cfbb95f66ad-4
00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:02.460
bicycle and behind him.

da17d57f-033b-4994-be85-c62569ba1e85-0
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.000
Well.

12b0e703-d7b6-4d16-ab27-231015431ffe-0
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.000
He found something.

5e0afc59-25fa-440c-af95-e6f6f4e5b4df-0
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.150
I don't know where he found it
and I don't know what it is.

b8b019c1-948a-4af8-ac27-ecc28516d6c4-0
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.960
But he found something on.

b25f40ca-127c-4474-94ad-0915a0c97499-0
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.050
Looks like maybe watch?

f4d40afc-610b-40d3-90f6-dbfcc6d3822b-0
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.910
And he opened it, and he's maybe
trying to figure out.

eeda681d-1287-4424-8a6c-6dc095f7dbf1-0
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.546
Which way he should go? Maybe
it's a compass, maybe it's a

eeda681d-1287-4424-8a6c-6dc095f7dbf1-1
00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:51.624
compass. Anyway, it's looking
every which way, trying to

eeda681d-1287-4424-8a6c-6dc095f7dbf1-2
00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:54.810
figure out which way to go, and
he finally starts walking.

b8600443-66f9-4ab5-93e9-f17163ad56ee-0
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.480
And he's not sure where he's
going.

62410895-8798-4dac-bd62-f74c2f22d8cd-0
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.066
He walks a little further, and
he sees those little white

62410895-8798-4dac-bd62-f74c2f22d8cd-1
00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:06.060
bubbles again. They're getting
bigger. Something like.

bc76be8c-4d64-4228-b66b-45f6eb90a3b0-0
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.110
They're small versions of the
big one that brought him there.

dec0bcfc-4d4d-4d75-815f-da3a5f566c46-0
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.610
But then suddenly they start.

0daf8a1e-8622-4209-859b-be9881db6a1b-0
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.311
Blowing starts blowing and it
blows off his head and it blows

0daf8a1e-8622-4209-859b-be9881db6a1b-1
00:30:19.311 --> 00:30:23.925
the bubbles and he goes to pick
up his hat and he puts it on his

0daf8a1e-8622-4209-859b-be9881db6a1b-2
00:30:23.925 --> 00:30:24.280
head.

dc226f50-1324-4c08-8c0e-17ba4ba97e40-0
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.955
And when he does that, he sees
something on the ground, almost

dc226f50-1324-4c08-8c0e-17ba4ba97e40-1
00:30:29.955 --> 00:30:34.357
like a map. He thinks maybe, oh,
it's a book, you know, it's not

dc226f50-1324-4c08-8c0e-17ba4ba97e40-2
00:30:34.357 --> 00:30:38.555
a map, it's a book. He finds a
book. He starts looking at it,

dc226f50-1324-4c08-8c0e-17ba4ba97e40-3
00:30:38.555 --> 00:30:42.550
thinking maybe that will tell
him what he needs to do. But

dc226f50-1324-4c08-8c0e-17ba4ba97e40-4
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.341
someone comes up and starts
talking to him and he turns

dc226f50-1324-4c08-8c0e-17ba4ba97e40-5
00:30:46.341 --> 00:30:50.539
around and looks and there's a
man with a turban and he says.

28512bc5-84fc-4bba-bbb8-30ccae6864f3-0
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.460
Come, can I help you? And the
man says, well, maybe. Let's

28512bc5-84fc-4bba-bbb8-30ccae6864f3-1
00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.865
see, what can I do for you is
the man in the turban. And the

28512bc5-84fc-4bba-bbb8-30ccae6864f3-2
00:30:59.865 --> 00:31:04.342
other man says, well, look, look
at this book. Let's see. I'm

28512bc5-84fc-4bba-bbb8-30ccae6864f3-3
00:31:04.342 --> 00:31:08.891
going to draw you what I want. I
want this bed. Oh, you want a

28512bc5-84fc-4bba-bbb8-30ccae6864f3-4
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:13.079
bed? He says, OK, well, come
this way. So he follows him.

fe73ec1b-7821-46da-8262-2a2f79828f8b-0
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.460
And he's hoping he's going to
find a bed. The man has a.

b6bcce86-0dd9-4886-bce4-6bb8df98032c-0
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:25.090
Basket on his back and there's a
armadillo looking out, right?

00c57fd2-6cf0-4cf9-967b-a01d2c524c08-0
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.650
What that is?

6a39a7ed-b607-4838-92f8-68156d0ff95d-0
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.562
OK, so he's hoping he's going to
get a place to sleep. The man

6a39a7ed-b607-4838-92f8-68156d0ff95d-1
00:31:33.562 --> 00:31:37.177
says try try this, and the man
says Ohh, thank you, thank you

6a39a7ed-b607-4838-92f8-68156d0ff95d-2
00:31:37.177 --> 00:31:37.760
very much.

d3e9ff62-4c62-40ee-8c77-383a5f98150b-0
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:46.563
He goes in, looks in the door,
and he sees a book and a little

d3e9ff62-4c62-40ee-8c77-383a5f98150b-1
00:31:46.563 --> 00:31:47.700
container.

53b554cd-e6d4-468d-8899-e135c5abeebb-0
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:53.120
And as he looks closer, the
container starts to open and.

9abead3f-bac8-46bb-9bfb-1a0474a12f88-0
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.050
Some kind of creature comes out.

7d308309-d062-4c5c-9af3-bc6cbf7a5774-0
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.350
A woman appears and says stop,
get back.

a6b8cf21-281d-4007-b492-9b471f2cb0d1-0
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.700
Don't shriek.

8bf502f6-17bb-49ff-b3a6-35f8072c4be0-0
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.140
She she just picks that little
creature up in her hand and the

8bf502f6-17bb-49ff-b3a6-35f8072c4be0-1
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.660
man says.

aae60ebd-0058-4c36-b64d-6214f69c2de5-0
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.816
Can you help me? I need a place
to sleep and get some money out.

aae60ebd-0058-4c36-b64d-6214f69c2de5-1
00:32:16.816 --> 00:32:21.130
There's about $3 there and she
writes in her book.

952d8d18-90a5-46c8-ba5e-fc36e64e2bb5-0
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:27.034
His name I assume, and takes his
money. She looks happy, gives

952d8d18-90a5-46c8-ba5e-fc36e64e2bb5-1
00:32:27.034 --> 00:32:29.430
him the key. Thanks. The key.

49bebe06-41d5-4c40-81f8-a1fbff81ebb6-0
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:35.507
And finds his room, he hopes. Oh
yes, he's matching the symbol on

49bebe06-41d5-4c40-81f8-a1fbff81ebb6-1
00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:38.210
the key to the symbol on the
door.

946a7e20-9eb2-4584-9c75-18bc4d873470-0
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.840
And goes in.

88d8dd8d-799c-49e0-b26b-bdeeabcb9ce6-0
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:41.620
Well.

d29862e3-c4ef-40e6-9641-2c2de5d4a533-0
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.870
It's an unusual room. She had a
bed.

d3a877bd-afe3-46a5-8142-32e8a53d6d7c-0
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:55.120
There's a ladder, some bottles,
some pipes, the chair, a table.

9d3b5a05-31eb-481d-a5c8-142dba7ce575-0
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.540
Light.

ceb2bee7-5f92-4a3f-9471-65d24d61bbc2-0
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:04.240
Some gears above a goblet.

1f62a4b5-1a98-4956-8c5e-b8bab844fa28-0
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.630
That's about it. Window.

1e1b01df-0b33-4009-95ff-c39d5a637511-0
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:09.190
Yeah.

2fcd71d4-b5f9-48c3-b9cd-7942163d9985-0
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.810
So he looks.

3b9bbe50-967a-461b-b5a1-601f53b94195-0
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.930
It's something I'm not sure.

c0386283-97d2-4ba2-a339-5a9805f58e00-0
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:26.020
Put his hat on the chair, and
then he looks at some little.

9f4d1da0-681a-4faf-b30d-e9b8888bd853-0
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.788
Lights, maybe? Looks out the
window. He's checking everything

9f4d1da0-681a-4faf-b30d-e9b8888bd853-1
00:33:31.788 --> 00:33:36.022
out. Looks out the window, looks
in the little bottles, looks in

9f4d1da0-681a-4faf-b30d-e9b8888bd853-2
00:33:36.022 --> 00:33:37.390
the other containers.

e6c5cb22-1cc0-49dd-8987-e2320d31300e-0
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.870
Looks closely at the lights,
opens the drawers.

98761082-733a-4e48-a139-10a15309edab-0
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:48.011
Rice to get some water turns
tries to turn the faucet on and

98761082-733a-4e48-a139-10a15309edab-1
00:33:48.011 --> 00:33:49.190
get some water.

e086852d-dd14-4a9f-a11f-b5ae55d26960-0
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.640
But out came some.

617cd408-0a9b-4511-9d68-9da4c3445b6d-0
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.030
Oh yeah, out came the water very
forcefully.

ccd8c076-55c3-49f3-aefe-39d9f1b278dc-0
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.618
Found a towel somewhere. Dried
himself off when he heard

ccd8c076-55c3-49f3-aefe-39d9f1b278dc-1
00:34:01.618 --> 00:34:05.297
something in one of the
containers, so he lifted the top

ccd8c076-55c3-49f3-aefe-39d9f1b278dc-2
00:34:05.297 --> 00:34:07.040
and when he lifted the top.

2a51c268-2a70-4578-ac13-93a458c1642d-0
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.150
Seesaw.

71a24fe0-9243-42b7-b257-7635881ae9b4-0
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.130
Being.

49730f79-fea0-4fda-9252-4038d9fa8b18-0
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.560
White.

bb1efee3-11e9-408b-9e6b-00c30c8d0a48-0
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.343
Fish with feet and a long tail.
They looked a little surprised.

bb1efee3-11e9-408b-9e6b-00c30c8d0a48-1
00:34:17.343 --> 00:34:21.135
Tried to close them back in
there but didn't get it closed

bb1efee3-11e9-408b-9e6b-00c30c8d0a48-2
00:34:21.135 --> 00:34:23.000
in time and out ran the fish.

d71acc54-a935-4629-b9d4-311f28aac146-0
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.116
How's the door? Up a ladder and
into a little room. Well, the

d71acc54-a935-4629-b9d4-311f28aac146-1
00:34:28.116 --> 00:34:32.304
man followed him up the ladder
and lo and behold, showed him

d71acc54-a935-4629-b9d4-311f28aac146-2
00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:33.540
where the bed was.

d08a381b-9a71-4018-a215-ff04e852f0c4-0
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.080
Now he's got. Now he found his
bed.

ecea4798-ec4d-4f42-b0ee-96219d6b0fa2-0
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.250
The fish is sitting on the bed,
OK.

bc59a298-9e4e-4452-9e19-1f2d01a0f0c1-0
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:48.239
Well, the man went back down,
got his suitcase, came up the

bc59a298-9e4e-4452-9e19-1f2d01a0f0c1-1
00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:48.560
ladder.

21d96845-f1a1-4e5e-af17-a5840b05c49c-0
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:55.373

holding hands and he just looks

60baaab4-fa6c-47e7-8970-ea1e49ee9f43-1

Surfboard maybe, but he's just
thinking about using it, but

d1d05a81-96ca-4bf1-a199-e699353fa10e-1
00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:20.440
probably decided there's not
enough room.

f359ee94-58fb-4ee9-9c31-3f2a2c478161-0
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:26.140

keep going? We're good whenever

574bb225-ad31-4c0e-af9c-1355b7790241-1
00:41:30.965 --> 00:41:32.530
you because we're. We have.}

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:33.720
{OK.}

{And we can move on to the next
item, which it's ohh that one.

00:41:41.038 --> 00:41:46.390
OK, yes, a story whenever you're
ready. OK, this is going.}

e44e36e0-27bf-4894-b8cf-b2eace77113f-0
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.390
{OK, there's 2 pages.}

829c102b-579d-4487-9f6a-2881653cfc24-0
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.110
{Yeah. And then it goes over
there, OK.}

de25442c-fd8c-4493-adc2-578fb5a8fa39-0
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.090
#START_return So we see.

8a4303da-6e70-42ba-910f-531807477b8c-0
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.787
Man, maybe in his 20s. Got a
beard. He's at a drawing table,

8a4303da-6e70-42ba-910f-531807477b8c-1
00:42:01.787 --> 00:42:06.974
he's working on something, and
in the door floats a red kite

8a4303da-6e70-42ba-910f-531807477b8c-2
00:42:06.974 --> 00:42:08.590
while he's working.

fdc171e7-d1ab-4e71-8cfc-b1c8ab3e5c08-0
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.890
Downstairs, he's working.
Upstairs, there's a.

b97ce891-fec0-4f9b-8044-bbc1c3a60bf6-0
00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:18.789
There's a small door in the
lower part of the wall. We don't

b97ce891-fec0-4f9b-8044-bbc1c3a60bf6-1
00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:23.164
know where that goes and there's
couple of pictures on the wall

b97ce891-fec0-4f9b-8044-bbc1c3a60bf6-2
00:42:23.164 --> 00:42:27.266
and shelf with books, but he's
working up there and then we

b97ce891-fec0-4f9b-8044-bbc1c3a60bf6-3
00:42:27.266 --> 00:42:27.540
can.

a715112a-6675-495c-ba1a-fc71eae4124c-0
00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.812
We can see below him because
he's a cross section of the

a715112a-6675-495c-ba1a-fc71eae4124c-1
00:42:31.812 --> 00:42:32.670
building is a.

0897409d-4bc6-4f9d-bbd4-ce4a0dac7908-0
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:39.356
Hall, you could come downstairs.
You reach a hall with the door

0897409d-4bc6-4f9d-bbd4-ce4a0dac7908-1
00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:44.128
to the outside. A couple more
pictures on the wall and a big

0897409d-4bc6-4f9d-bbd4-ce4a0dac7908-2
00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:48.821
vase with a plant in it and a
lamp on a small table. And we

0897409d-4bc6-4f9d-bbd4-ce4a0dac7908-3
00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:53.593
can see the lower level too. We
can see some pipes and maybe

0897409d-4bc6-4f9d-bbd4-ce4a0dac7908-4
00:42:53.593 --> 00:42:57.270
part of the furnace. Well, OK,
he or the kite.

d1805ace-edcd-4bf8-9cfb-17f9ad54deb2-0
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.720
The kite looks like it might.

23d6f826-dc79-4f85-a21b-044caf351be4-0
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.735
I don't know where it's going.
It went. I don't know where the

23d6f826-dc79-4f85-a21b-044caf351be4-1
00:43:08.735 --> 00:43:09.430
kite went.

6ae36109-da0c-4bac-ba2c-5281efc69b85-0
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.630
The kite went, but now we're
looking at another room.

eb05c3a9-ab30-4df0-9452-91473af56a17-0
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.720
We're looking at.

dd776ca5-d7b0-4718-b4c1-59763c48d825-0
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:21.253
An upstairs and a downstairs. I
don't know if it's the same

dd776ca5-d7b0-4718-b4c1-59763c48d825-1
00:43:21.253 --> 00:43:22.400
house or not, but.

42c7b6bb-08f7-4cc0-b2d7-e8e41cb31aac-0
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:27.676
Upstairs there's some photos on
the wall, and there's a room

42c7b6bb-08f7-4cc0-b2d7-e8e41cb31aac-1
00:43:27.676 --> 00:43:32.168
with a cat sleeping on the bed,
and we can see the bathroom

42c7b6bb-08f7-4cc0-b2d7-e8e41cb31aac-2
00:43:32.168 --> 00:43:36.884
because we could see this thing
and the mirror. And down below

42c7b6bb-08f7-4cc0-b2d7-e8e41cb31aac-3
00:43:36.884 --> 00:43:41.750
there's the kitchen on the left
because we see some cabinets and

42c7b6bb-08f7-4cc0-b2d7-e8e41cb31aac-4
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.466
some drawers and stove. And then
there's another room, maybe a

42c7b6bb-08f7-4cc0-b2d7-e8e41cb31aac-5
00:43:46.466 --> 00:43:47.439
child's room.

bafc4406-a6f4-4353-87bd-dac756f926bd-0
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.294
The child has something red and
it's in his left hand, it's got

bafc4406-a6f4-4353-87bd-dac756f926bd-1
00:43:55.294 --> 00:43:58.860
a crown on and he's drawing with
a red crayon.

7336d96f-1e45-4d40-8af0-24b6a3506023-0
00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.530
{Super, right?} Like he's
drawing a door.

bdbba895-d5a0-46a6-9661-28bb4ae9a959-0
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:05.810
Hmm.

ffacadbe-a467-4938-80e0-95126601c827-0
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.850
Ah, so there's.

a89b3d4f-3cf0-4378-8575-d39eff55a079-0
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.640
Huh.

0984b106-954a-4846-93d2-f449ea80d0be-0
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.810
That's just.

79d92a65-c921-4d1b-b6c8-91eaeb437476-0
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.890
OK, now that man that was at the
drawing table is down in.

dc31c38c-5828-433e-849a-cde5a4a09b2e-0
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.520
In the room.

a2112e22-b1c0-4fce-8f99-ff8a989afcb7-0
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:30.506
{No, I'm not sure. She's the
only. This is all I have. Oh.

a2112e22-b1c0-4fce-8f99-ff8a989afcb7-1
00:44:30.506 --> 00:44:35.463
Oh. I didn't see that. Hold on.
See that? OK.} The man the

a2112e22-b1c0-4fce-8f99-ff8a989afcb7-2
00:44:35.463 --> 00:44:40.420
drawing table sees the kite on
the ground. He picks it up.

d55877f8-6782-40fc-a76b-c1e58bfd4944-0
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:47.320
Looks at it, and he leaves it
there and proceeds downstairs.

0d089f76-e58c-4ff9-a71f-1e04117e9eb6-0
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.520
Where he goes to find.

812eeec3-fcd1-481e-83ab-694984180d95-0
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.210
Maybe that little boy, but the
little boy's gone, however.

51cf81ae-0db8-4278-aa9e-fb43e93995bc-0
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.745
He sees that door in the lower,
sees another door that looks

51cf81ae-0db8-4278-aa9e-fb43e93995bc-1
00:45:02.745 --> 00:45:07.027
like the one in his room, and
it's red. It's a red door. Maybe

51cf81ae-0db8-4278-aa9e-fb43e93995bc-2
00:45:07.027 --> 00:45:10.970
it's the door driven, drawn by
the boy. He's looking out.

955e386e-bcab-4408-8fae-bdbb88b629b7-0
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.433
But he's not sure if he should
go. {I don't know what else find

955e386e-bcab-4408-8fae-bdbb88b629b7-1
00:45:15.433 --> 00:45:15.720
out.}

a2c927f5-63e7-4907-9827-70300894a674-0
00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.750
So I guess.

02bb800c-18bd-431c-9a28-895077555411-0
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:21.830
I guess he went.

89a1a7dc-e784-4d94-976b-490af574a598-0
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:28.985
I guess he went, because there
he is. He comes out the door,

89a1a7dc-e784-4d94-976b-490af574a598-1
00:45:28.985 --> 00:45:32.380
comes out the base of a tree in
the woods.

a9387666-d322-40ea-a130-4dda0c362fee-0
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:39.755
Think I've seen this before?
Yeah, there's a lot of lanterns

a9387666-d322-40ea-a130-4dda0c362fee-1
00:45:39.755 --> 00:45:43.870
in this guy. It seems to be
maybe dusk.

fd988ba5-71b6-4bca-88a9-601efebaaf0e-0
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:50.971
And there's a lot of trees and
lanterns, but he looks a little

fd988ba5-71b6-4bca-88a9-601efebaaf0e-1
00:45:50.971 --> 00:45:56.561
further and he sees a red ball
sitting on a dock near the

fd988ba5-71b6-4bca-88a9-601efebaaf0e-2
00:45:56.561 --> 00:45:57.140
water.

1a82502d-4723-4da4-804b-ff8376e8b75a-0
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.005
And I will see if he goes over
there. So he goes over there

1a82502d-4723-4da4-804b-ff8376e8b75a-1
00:46:05.005 --> 00:46:05.360
and.

27a87653-e35c-4ec1-8974-b5f988a84e21-0
00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.020
He picks it up.

0da32a67-f844-4331-a772-08b26e89252c-0
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.480
And just as he picks it up.

3b8c1831-f56d-412b-8794-69836e5f282d-0
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.040
In the water.

6c57ba5d-7f61-4a65-b5a4-72d1ce5ea978-0
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.360
stream comes a large white, a
large wood.

5842fcfa-f584-40eb-8911-8edee872fc26-0
00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.830
Sort of a boat, yeah.

670d8cb9-3ab6-4dda-bb06-9a97ba046087-0
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.990
And he's looking at it and he
decides to hop on it. Oh no.

92c9c6f2-f78f-4cef-ae09-cf77e25cdd8f-0
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.869
See how fine you decide? Yeah,
you still in there as it goes

92c9c6f2-f78f-4cef-ae09-cf77e25cdd8f-1
00:46:34.869 --> 00:46:35.020
by.

ed324418-d907-41ad-99f9-f95f3777dd73-0
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.361
He's thinking and thinking and
yeah, he decides. I guess right

ed324418-d907-41ad-99f9-f95f3777dd73-1
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:42.771
at the last moment, just in
time, he's going to hop on his

ed324418-d907-41ad-99f9-f95f3777dd73-2
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:43.060
boat.

fdf1f48c-b3a6-4f84-8765-c0a1d7b0f913-0
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:44.910
OK.

8c0a3d6d-e3d7-43f6-aebc-1a0c23e89e2c-0
00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:51.740
And the boat

e7bd1f0b-f36b-411c-b000-d9ce8a016f84-0
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.780
Comes to a big castle.

0727610b-b112-42b5-8263-f75364bf5e9d-0
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.300
And.

0dd427e4-24bf-4eff-8686-e06519a6486a-0
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.100
I don't see anybody in the
castle.

b326a745-5dd0-47d7-af6e-e2ec21b65344-0
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.000
But he's working. He's
straining, holding his hand up

b326a745-5dd0-47d7-af6e-e2ec21b65344-1
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.560
over his eyes to see.

f2f5b2d8-1b08-40df-82c8-1e13a99c23f0-0
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.990
What's going on?

78129c98-0de6-4b67-9d7d-1eea671d64e5-0
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:16.480
Yeah.

70b33a03-a24d-4941-a5ae-3d67f009a56d-0
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.400
In the distance.

31cc701b-8eb8-4870-b8e4-61e81c54fe3a-0
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.900
There's a bridge.

1d742779-3b71-492b-92e9-a5159c3a4aef-0
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.120
You know, over the bridge.

a39f2449-8a80-418b-aa2b-d3ce8cf52367-0
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:33.090
Is the little.

ffab49d3-623d-40eb-88ba-5bb7ac74f5be-0
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:38.544
The little boy, I think he was
looking for the little boy. He's

ffab49d3-623d-40eb-88ba-5bb7ac74f5be-1
00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:42.846
a little boat, little red boat
going over the bridge. He's a

ffab49d3-623d-40eb-88ba-5bb7ac74f5be-2
00:47:42.846 --> 00:47:45.950
little further ahead going into
the castle.

10c3c3c0-102e-4d2c-8fe1-d4728e68e166-0
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:47.920
Yes.

48f4b403-fe80-49d7-a690-130db116d749-0
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.410
So the older man catches up to.

8c9eb802-5763-4319-b44b-c29731529ff1-0
00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.460
The boy that was.

d2b70153-a254-431b-9905-35a15259142e-0
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.320
The boy left his.

433ad3f2-d46f-4f0a-8198-bb4b816a522f-0
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:10.135
dropped just ball, the ball is
now on the boat that the man was

433ad3f2-d46f-4f0a-8198-bb4b816a522f-1
00:48:10.135 --> 00:48:15.144
riding and he's boys running up
the stairs to see a king and

433ad3f2-d46f-4f0a-8198-bb4b816a522f-2
00:48:15.144 --> 00:48:16.130
another boy.

7e7df664-4efd-4d45-9e4b-22e1f88584f1-0
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.853
And there's some people watching
and older man is running after

7e7df664-4efd-4d45-9e4b-22e1f88584f1-1
00:48:22.853 --> 00:48:23.550
this boy.

7ad4b51e-8cb6-42da-8b19-b1e436dfd469-0
00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:25.530
And.

e3ce49b0-6fbc-4100-94b4-9c056cba5dba-0
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:35.903
The boy that was there with the
king looks. Is it a girl? {Oh, I

e3ce49b0-6fbc-4100-94b4-9c056cba5dba-1
00:48:35.903 --> 00:48:38.960
can't tell who's who here, but
sorry.}

2526b277-1d38-451d-97e0-3c38b59c571d-0
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:44.990
The girl looks not very happy
and.

cef7b8db-e5de-490e-a1a8-3fc3e2de46ea-0
00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.385
{I I just don't know what to say
about this. We can go on you

cef7b8db-e5de-490e-a1a8-3fc3e2de46ea-1
00:48:51.385 --> 00:48:54.929
yeah ohh you can describe some
of the objects in the

cef7b8db-e5de-490e-a1a8-3fc3e2de46ea-2
00:48:54.929 --> 00:48:59.007
background. Ohh you want. OK be
exhaustive OK objects in the

cef7b8db-e5de-490e-a1a8-3fc3e2de46ea-3
00:48:59.007 --> 00:49:02.885
background we always looks like
} there's an ocean in the

cef7b8db-e5de-490e-a1a8-3fc3e2de46ea-4
00:49:02.885 --> 00:49:07.165
background there. All the bird.
{I didn't mention that}  purple

cef7b8db-e5de-490e-a1a8-3fc3e2de46ea-5
00:49:07.165 --> 00:49:11.110
bird. The sky is beautiful shade
of blue and purple there.

7e6cac4e-7627-4d41-8e3d-b8591cb77e0e-0
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.480
Buildings are.

d3539cd2-5c3a-41ca-9299-ad5af58bdc38-0
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:22.910
domes on top and inside where
the king is.

7a6224be-ffc9-4e46-879f-5631cbbb9572-0
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:27.051
he has a crown. The boy has a
crown, the girl has a crown, and

7a6224be-ffc9-4e46-879f-5631cbbb9572-1
00:49:27.051 --> 00:49:27.840
there's a throne.

eb408068-9439-477c-8dbd-9dfa22dceb84-0
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.780
{Sounds good.}

a0649031-97d3-4e32-b19e-e532f4342c56-0
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:42.335
Now they're all inside. The
king, the boy, the girl and the

a0649031-97d3-4e32-b19e-e532f4342c56-1
00:49:42.335 --> 00:49:47.107
man. And something's arrived.
Something's coming, arriving. It

a0649031-97d3-4e32-b19e-e532f4342c56-2
00:49:47.107 --> 00:49:49.910
seems to be coming out of that
boat.

9db99ae2-7c58-4f37-8954-e4b5f959f4ac-0
00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:52.630
The man came in.

6b093f46-be89-4631-b1dd-00e7daf50882-0
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.130
Just at the same time that
Purple Bird is coming.

e0f00980-097b-466c-baa8-d07c7ee75491-0
00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.650
Can see stars in the sky.

46f3e47f-81e6-41db-8e66-7c8aae215ce7-0
00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.010
The.

7646350c-524a-4c56-b0cc-48ecad283230-0
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.322
There's more than one person
coming out of that boat. There's

7646350c-524a-4c56-b0cc-48ecad283230-1
00:50:06.322 --> 00:50:06.620
a few.

70cc5cd3-a9c4-4528-b64c-b6bea583777c-0
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.120
Soldiers, and the King holds
something up.

cb0588c6-8a3e-49e7-9097-e467d4f4ae95-0
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:19.279
It's as if to say stop or go
away, and the man is holding his

cb0588c6-8a3e-49e7-9097-e467d4f4ae95-1
00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:25.826
hand up as if to say to his
daughter to stay there. Don't

cb0588c6-8a3e-49e7-9097-e467d4f4ae95-2
00:50:25.826 --> 00:50:27.520
get any closer.

09db631b-60f0-469e-b2fc-94d57a8095ac-0
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.130
{I don't know.}

78f00de2-97b5-48e2-8248-ab3f0cde5345-0
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:35.170
{That's about it.}  So battle
ensues.

22acf366-3cf8-4631-9b77-5ac162b66314-0
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:43.229
The King uses his magic wand or
sword or whatever. I guess it's

22acf366-3cf8-4631-9b77-5ac162b66314-1
00:50:43.229 --> 00:50:46.510
a sword he uses tries to use his
sword.

41b525ae-90e0-446c-b99d-78519a6000a9-0
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:57.995
The soldier has a really
elaborate sword, and he's able

41b525ae-90e0-446c-b99d-78519a6000a9-1
00:50:57.995 --> 00:50:58.410
to.

830da0a1-aff4-4fbe-abea-36c2377bc801-0
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:05.848
Whip the King's sword out of his
hand, and then two soldiers grab

830da0a1-aff4-4fbe-abea-36c2377bc801-1
00:51:05.848 --> 00:51:10.930
hold of the king while the
children and the man watch.

2413c582-ef4d-4976-8267-22ea57bf1eda-0
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:14.840
{I don't know. It's alright.}

b64805f5-7e74-4572-834c-be69fab45237-0
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:19.180
The boy then.

82c559ca-99e0-4f1c-a95e-83cc866153ec-0
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.910
Grabs his purple crayon.

e8e98bb8-2957-46e8-8a9c-fb8cca2a1157-0
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.690
Umm.

cb9acc3a-96ab-4061-8737-5a31f5a7aba7-0
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.230
And draws.

7848fd32-8bda-4f8b-b93a-375ac8ade77d-0
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.230
Draws up a big purple bird.

d868a3d7-ed3b-43f0-8c0a-44d387486ad7-0
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:44.245
Wow, one of the soldiers is
running after the man and the

d868a3d7-ed3b-43f0-8c0a-44d387486ad7-1
00:51:44.245 --> 00:51:45.150
girl and.

04efdc70-82b6-4468-8ce9-e2ef819d8577-0
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.750
The boy and he draws it.

13d22281-7b33-4d8e-afd5-879463a84d52-0
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.240
It's so big that all three of
them can get on board and.

8888fda1-e1e3-4399-9ed1-253e644bb374-0
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.430
And it flies off into the sky.

88771b19-5bd5-44f1-8c9d-c21c24877439-0
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.630
Now the soldier just just missed
them.

04410b94-90a3-4478-a63e-779db73b6c03-0
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:04.480
Down below.

8e4cabf6-5305-48d4-b4e4-c3d536792366-0
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:10.180
It's a little island with a
house and a windmill.

8d560067-77b8-44aa-a084-c6e9d49d27e1-0
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:12.760
OK.

eb04282f-3a34-4286-bd60-6801852fb28e-0
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.641
So the boy and the girl and the
man are still on this bird,

eb04282f-3a34-4286-bd60-6801852fb28e-1
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:25.910
flying away and down below.

b0c5b38b-d2a1-4283-b5c4-4bc4fa0ad927-0
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.240
The soldier is still trying to.

0bc89924-667d-4436-9aa7-8acd74b791ed-0
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:39.620
grab them I think he might have
grabbed hold of the Purple

0bc89924-667d-4436-9aa7-8acd74b791ed-1
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.310
Bird's tail and stopped them.

615e432c-70cc-472b-bba0-8e44aa920c14-0
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.516
{I'm not sure there's, I just
don't know what else to say

615e432c-70cc-472b-bba0-8e44aa920c14-1
00:52:48.516 --> 00:52:49.080
about this.}

5861a429-e62a-4752-acef-5a448ee3c56f-0
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:54.432
The boy has his arms up. He's
looks afraid. They all look

5861a429-e62a-4752-acef-5a448ee3c56f-1
00:52:54.432 --> 00:52:58.484
afraid. The girl has her red
crayon, so maybe she'll Draw

5861a429-e62a-4752-acef-5a448ee3c56f-2
00:52:58.484 --> 00:53:00.930
Something else they can escape
in.

777a6a4e-0da5-4198-89d5-ecee0ac02b1e-0
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.420
Ohh.

e7984dd1-6cdd-468d-b4db-5f982d29e36e-0
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:11.330
Hmm.

6cd82926-663c-4cc3-ac6e-39d142c654d2-0
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:17.841
The kids. The soldier had
something that really injured

6cd82926-663c-4cc3-ac6e-39d142c654d2-1
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:22.495
the bird because she couldn't
see all the feathers being

6cd82926-663c-4cc3-ac6e-39d142c654d2-2
00:53:22.495 --> 00:53:23.720
falling to her.

ea44605f-cd37-483b-b900-c3b0a145abd4-0
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.150
Falling away and the.

e81ced79-c2fc-48a4-a7e2-e7191c63ae28-0
00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:32.388
And the boy fell off the bird
and the soldiers grabbed him. So

e81ced79-c2fc-48a4-a7e2-e7191c63ae28-1
00:53:32.388 --> 00:53:36.337
they now have the boy and the
girl, and the man and the girl

e81ced79-c2fc-48a4-a7e2-e7191c63ae28-2
00:53:36.337 --> 00:53:38.150
are falling through the air.

c9525dd3-cc95-45fb-a0cc-7d9999001a31-0
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:44.160
Feathers all around them. She
still has her.

46d3d49e-6e59-4879-b9d7-ec9016220fa0-0
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.025
Red crayon. They're holding
hands and the crown is falling

46d3d49e-6e59-4879-b9d7-ec9016220fa0-1
00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:49.800
off her head.

bb57d134-7819-4723-807e-a06611e33cf3-0
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.476
{I don't know what else to say
there.}  So she quickly knew she

bb57d134-7819-4723-807e-a06611e33cf3-1
00:53:56.476 --> 00:54:00.437
was going to do something with
that great crown. Quickly she

bb57d134-7819-4723-807e-a06611e33cf3-2
00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:03.750
she starts drawing something
large and red, maybe.

6de6cf8f-520d-425b-96ac-80abe9591c83-0
00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.492
Some kind of airplane. If
they're in their mid air, she's

6de6cf8f-520d-425b-96ac-80abe9591c83-1
00:54:09.492 --> 00:54:14.243
able to draw, see a little bit
of the bird coming up behind

6de6cf8f-520d-425b-96ac-80abe9591c83-2
00:54:14.243 --> 00:54:14.560
her.

d85da945-8ae6-410d-9af3-e5721fcd8dcc-0
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:15.790
Hmm.

2bc5a3b2-300d-4934-9201-c968f1c4e373-0
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:18.680
Uh.

3af8d722-2f40-490c-8714-64860906ea02-0
00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.340
She drew a submarine.

a2cedbe6-0a11-4e5b-9765-e5929a826cad-0
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.459
Oh, they're not in the air.
They're now, they're in the

a2cedbe6-0a11-4e5b-9765-e5929a826cad-1
00:54:25.459 --> 00:54:27.280
water. So she drew a submarine.

b4bcbe9f-8918-42d6-9b49-bb4f97d27360-0
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.990
Now they're below the water the
bird is in there with.

329bd91f-91be-4f38-bd6e-71dffc56830d-0
00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.490
With them, they're underwater
and we can see.

844e3484-e350-4946-9dc2-730dcd44feaa-0
00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.890
Sponges and some.

c7786f88-1cb8-4402-9332-80bc3d90a604-0
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.320
Fish.

016717b4-fad8-40f7-a783-6267a6c3b8cc-0
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:48.800
Yeah, some coral.

499840bd-cc37-4be7-90ab-4251a8c0ed5a-0
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.500
Their Periscope is up above the
level so they can.

fa66df93-f97d-4802-a93c-fe14b664f775-0
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:00.555
They can see if there's anything
up there, but they can't be seen

fa66df93-f97d-4802-a93c-fe14b664f775-1
00:55:00.555 --> 00:55:04.296
because they're in their red
submarine. Looks like the the

fa66df93-f97d-4802-a93c-fe14b664f775-2
00:55:04.296 --> 00:55:04.740
man is.

9971e33e-e98a-4512-bb37-7d9ff6c9a6fb-0
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:10.340
Driving it, operating it, and
she's looking out the Periscope.

d26756cc-82b4-42ad-9207-6fab234d2fd4-0
00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.167
Ohh, the Periscope the submarine
ran aground. Looks like they're

d26756cc-82b4-42ad-9207-6fab234d2fd4-1
00:55:20.167 --> 00:55:24.049
stuck. They're stuck, but they
see some beautiful cave

d26756cc-82b4-42ad-9207-6fab234d2fd4-2
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:28.213
drawings. They're. So they
they're out of the water now. I

d26756cc-82b4-42ad-9207-6fab234d2fd4-3
00:55:28.213 --> 00:55:32.588
don't know if they're out of the
water. They've come. They've

d26756cc-82b4-42ad-9207-6fab234d2fd4-4
00:55:32.588 --> 00:55:36.399
come ashore. Yeah, it seems like
they've come ashore.

93742261-54e0-4aa4-90b8-ff546f5632c3-0
00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:42.215
And they're they're in a cave
and they see some amazing cave

93742261-54e0-4aa4-90b8-ff546f5632c3-1
00:55:42.215 --> 00:55:42.870
drawings.

46eac1d7-b953-460f-bb18-75a0f881deaa-0
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:49.890
And they're just looking at them
and the bird is still there and.

34fb5f5f-637c-4dca-a0dd-19b415bdae15-0
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.419
Looks like they might have gone
in to The Cave deeper into The

34fb5f5f-637c-4dca-a0dd-19b415bdae15-1
00:55:55.419 --> 00:55:57.710
Cave because I don't see them
anymore.

4e5cf162-7c62-4a23-9475-7808ab82cec2-0
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.458
They are. They're in The Cave
and there's more drawings and

4e5cf162-7c62-4a23-9475-7808ab82cec2-1
00:56:06.458 --> 00:56:10.031
she's pointing like, here's more
look at this and bird. The bird

4e5cf162-7c62-4a23-9475-7808ab82cec2-2
00:56:10.031 --> 00:56:13.000
is following them, the purple
bird, and they're just.

efe87c39-505f-4499-ae56-dc3057fddde2-0
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:18.200
Following a path, there is a
little door.

7c853e2e-5aed-456c-b856-775f6b783f2e-0
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:22.820
Below a ledge, but I don't know
if they've seen it.

46aeb4b7-2403-40b5-90ae-cdcc7bd4281d-0
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.340
Um

2baae7fa-c833-424b-8c84-523787731a2a-0
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.132
Looks like they went back out
either a maybe a different way

2baae7fa-c833-424b-8c84-523787731a2a-1
00:56:30.132 --> 00:56:33.816
because I don't see the
submarine and now this sky is no

2baae7fa-c833-424b-8c84-523787731a2a-2
00:56:33.816 --> 00:56:37.564
longer dark purple, it's light
blue. Things seem a little

2baae7fa-c833-424b-8c84-523787731a2a-3
00:56:37.564 --> 00:56:40.150
calmer and there's no soldiers
insight.

988cfb54-7bc4-4ba5-b62c-aa5b7b7d0746-0
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:51.631
So the man says, can I please
have your black crayons? And she

988cfb54-7bc4-4ba5-b62c-aa5b7b7d0746-1
00:56:51.631 --> 00:56:54.590
says OK, and he draws a large.

b7c12805-f0a4-4087-b9e6-287fb135985b-0
00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.790
Rectangle.

7b7437a1-de49-4ef7-9515-5473b8c9c7fc-0
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:03.716
And from the rectangle hangs a
little perch for the purple

7b7437a1-de49-4ef7-9515-5473b8c9c7fc-1
00:57:03.716 --> 00:57:07.628
bird, and the bird just flies
right up there and sits right

7b7437a1-de49-4ef7-9515-5473b8c9c7fc-2
00:57:07.628 --> 00:57:08.020
there.

c358ee45-f825-4e81-b540-db929620afe2-0
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.250
{Anything about this side?}

092003c5-098e-4257-bf70-b72608e12471-0
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:18.798
{Oh, I didn't even see that
size. Ohh, sorry. Oh, how did I

092003c5-098e-4257-bf70-b72608e12471-1
00:57:18.798 --> 00:57:23.856
miss that? They came out. Oh, I
only saw. I totally didn't see

092003c5-098e-4257-bf70-b72608e12471-2
00:57:23.856 --> 00:57:29.076
that.} OK, they came out, but as
they came out. Oh, it wasn't so

092003c5-098e-4257-bf70-b72608e12471-3
00:57:29.076 --> 00:57:32.690
peaceful. They saw soldiers in
the distance.

57ba6980-4174-4147-a269-1a7a65494c09-0
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.095
So they knew they'd better not
go that way. So that's when he

57ba6980-4174-4147-a269-1a7a65494c09-1
00:57:38.095 --> 00:57:38.410
drew.

bcec9e34-97d2-4f0f-a155-ed2c090fbe01-0
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.728
The rectangle and the perch
maybe the. I don't know how

bcec9e34-97d2-4f0f-a155-ed2c090fbe01-1
00:57:42.728 --> 00:57:44.940
that's going to get them out,
but.

c3d0fd4e-ce2d-46b8-8c0c-3c507f64fa24-0
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.640
We will see, yeah.

af001760-9679-4b5e-8158-1b9b28a881f5-0
00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:51.390
Ohh.

bc027598-5bad-473b-84cb-a47e3523a439-0
00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:59.584
So the soldier ran to the bird,
and they knew that would happen

bc027598-5bad-473b-84cb-a47e3523a439-1
00:57:59.584 --> 00:58:05.680
while they hid behind the column
of stone, watching and.

a3554805-8579-4c53-a0e5-b86c67f38dcd-0
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.010
While the soldier tried to get
the bird.

f5325947-5fde-4ce9-b719-526b4ff0cb21-0
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:18.143
They were very clever and they
made they made a perch that

f5325947-5fde-4ce9-b719-526b4ff0cb21-1
00:58:18.143 --> 00:58:22.910
would close on soldier as soon
as he stepped in there. So the.

f381282c-b12d-487f-990a-bb4dcbd99665-0
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.350
Bird flew away.

6710baf4-e913-4a8e-bf3c-9ff2bf212215-0
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.080
But the soldier got trapped.

58f20f6f-b238-4f5d-833a-65234a9ff8f9-0
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:35.270
He's behind bars and the ohh and
he lost his.

273d9463-3787-4f76-8ae1-237b7d6dc6a7-0
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:41.183
Weapon that destroyed the bird.
Now they have it. Now the man

273d9463-3787-4f76-8ae1-237b7d6dc6a7-1
00:58:41.183 --> 00:58:44.751
has has it and I'm not sure
where the bird is. Actually I

273d9463-3787-4f76-8ae1-237b7d6dc6a7-2
00:58:44.751 --> 00:58:47.950
only see a couple feathers. I'm
hoping he got away.

594fab70-68a9-42e5-b255-43f693467a68-0
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:52.210


52dcd847-c56c-4570-ac0e-809f87bd0d22-0
00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:57.110
OK, so he smashes the weapon.

569f15eb-a615-4daa-9821-6051849d2afd-0
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:03.470
The magic weapon. And when he
does that out comes all kinds of

569f15eb-a615-4daa-9821-6051849d2afd-1
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:08.314
things that probably were
trapped in there, destroyed but

569f15eb-a615-4daa-9821-6051849d2afd-2
00:59:08.314 --> 00:59:13.073
and they come out in a rainbow
of color. Butterflies and

569f15eb-a615-4daa-9821-6051849d2afd-3
00:59:13.073 --> 00:59:14.410
dragonflies and.

bbeeb66e-540a-4ee6-badc-dd6e558b4414-0
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.830
Birds and butterflies, I said
that.

6f32626a-b9ce-4726-9433-446657750e4d-0
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.320
And they all fly away.

1b3b02e6-90c6-4986-a157-b728b879c152-0
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:26.172
One soldier is still trapped in
there, and the other two

1b3b02e6-90c6-4986-a157-b728b879c152-1
00:59:26.172 --> 00:59:30.721
soldiers are just so surprised
they're they're in shock and

1b3b02e6-90c6-4986-a157-b728b879c152-2
00:59:30.721 --> 00:59:33.300
while they're looking at all
the.

678997f0-131b-448b-a236-cbb530ca1b7e-0
00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.190
Animals escaping.

69fdaec2-3ac4-4c60-b025-84c0b477192a-0
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.142
The king comes from maybe. Oh,
he must have been destroyed. He

69fdaec2-3ac4-4c60-b025-84c0b477192a-1
00:59:42.142 --> 00:59:47.082
must have been gotten too, so he
came out too. So. But he grabs

69fdaec2-3ac4-4c60-b025-84c0b477192a-2
00:59:47.082 --> 00:59:48.240
the boy's hand.

db1102eb-2f69-41bb-bc7b-a71a32483026-0
00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.765
No. The king and the boy were
probably destroyed by the

db1102eb-2f69-41bb-bc7b-a71a32483026-1
00:59:53.765 --> 00:59:57.061
weapons, so they come out too,
and we'll see if they all get

db1102eb-2f69-41bb-bc7b-a71a32483026-2
00:59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.465
you reunited. They're probably
going to go through that little

db1102eb-2f69-41bb-bc7b-a71a32483026-3
01:00:00.465 --> 01:00:01.060
door I saw.

3e235899-6424-475c-bc29-3a78c41b183e-0
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:07.160
Ohh this skies are

0f417f31-b9f0-49ba-9124-01945f7a4ee2-0
01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:10.930
Calming calmer now.

e8b68923-eb16-41e0-9d99-5720197109d3-0
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:16.970
big. One of the Big Blue birds
is taking that.

b4e512b7-6f15-4c24-8f81-9ce24e5ca6d3-0
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.090
Trapped soldier away.

3ca1e2c8-6802-48c1-a60d-22ad7d894f3e-0
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:28.880
I don't all the other soldiers
are leaving on their boat.

b505f527-e26f-4e85-ab0c-8244b403c808-0
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.736
The there's a lot of birds, all
kinds of colors flying around.

b505f527-e26f-4e85-ab0c-8244b403c808-1
01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:38.866
Still. They're flying. They're
flying off with the big purple

b505f527-e26f-4e85-ab0c-8244b403c808-2
01:00:38.866 --> 01:00:42.730
bird. There seems to be a big
purple dragon, maybe in the

b505f527-e26f-4e85-ab0c-8244b403c808-3
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:43.130
water.

656a3564-1ee6-4d79-92e3-2bf42b2e5125-0
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.882
And the king is there, the boy
is there, the girls there, the

656a3564-1ee6-4d79-92e3-2bf42b2e5125-1
01:00:48.882 --> 01:00:49.450
man's there.

1c02481f-3b74-4d19-a5d8-a543b9eb9390-0
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.240
And say goodbye. Now they're up.
There's that door.

8d927d5e-b0a6-455f-a1fb-1eb53da028f3-0
01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:00.375
The King, the king, and the boy
are staying, and the man and the

8d927d5e-b0a6-455f-a1fb-1eb53da028f3-1
01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:00.770
girl.

c51aa2f3-b6c0-42bc-ba3a-4b698b5c8c5b-0
01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.980
She doesn't want to go.

4290b8db-9482-4aa4-9dcd-ac23896533ac-0
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:09.320
Are going to go home through
that door, that little red kite

2e2b6bea-180c-4aa8-9bbc-8aba2c72b2d8-0
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.340
Is behind the door.

6f962bed-432b-4495-8266-322934cd41be-0
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:17.140
There it goes.

8d172aee-4cc8-4335-88d3-a978477fdaf6-0
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.280
there is the red kite

93317738-8935-4c19-92de-dc9ee66f028c-0
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:26.860
{Seeing anything?}  OK, you're
back home, but I don't see them.

bb476d8f-ca79-4eda-921b-e834b2105d84-0
01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:31.716

Looks like an arena, like where

01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:02.230

four horses pulling a chariot

01:04:39.384 --> 01:04:44.498
have worked together and created
a pile. And then one of them has

01:04:44.498 --> 01:04:49.303
climbed up on the pile. Two of
them, and they're climbing out

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:54.185
into the stands. One of them has
grabbed the pants of a man in

d7a3e867-6496-4aca-9a96-cb00bc48bb4e-0
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:38.735
Walks into town and she's going
down the street, which looks

d7a3e867-6496-4aca-9a96-cb00bc48bb4e-1
01:08:38.735 --> 01:08:39.490
like it's.

8e3f3a9b-8f42-4220-93ca-d90e8be8dd2e-0
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.730
Made of stone, not a little
stones.

42b55a8e-6854-4970-b3f4-e2d36a5ac018-0
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.810
She's under another street
light.

14fb5dbf-5799-465d-9ca9-1a5322a73fe2-0
01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:51.060
Um, there are people.

e3744dba-26bc-4b2a-a678-1715dbdd0cf4-0
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:58.160
Looking out of the door of a
nearby building, talking.

ff071ff8-2ac4-4112-9daa-edc60d816f43-0
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.955
There is another person standing
by the front door of their

ff071ff8-2ac4-4112-9daa-edc60d816f43-1
01:09:04.955 --> 01:09:10.522
building. You can see people
inside the windows. You can see

ff071ff8-2ac4-4112-9daa-edc60d816f43-2
01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:13.990
the shutters on the windows are
open.

2eee4e9c-14b6-49b2-9e1c-9ba10a65443e-0
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:20.385
Uh, there are stars in the sky
and these buildings are going to

2eee4e9c-14b6-49b2-9e1c-9ba10a65443e-1
01:09:20.385 --> 01:09:22.260
about 2-3 stories tall.

1bc258b4-3023-4dc2-ac17-330fd7af796d-0
01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:29.515
Um, must be a warm night because
all the windows are open. What's

1bc258b4-3023-4dc2-ac17-330fd7af796d-1
01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:34.530
that in the street? So maybe a
motorcycle in the street?

7925c31a-c723-4dae-86f4-da6f5539243c-0
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.482
That's not a garbage can. If
it's a garbage, no. It's a

7925c31a-c723-4dae-86f4-da6f5539243c-1
01:09:40.482 --> 01:09:42.460
statue of a man on a horse.

c4653549-f1f5-4726-8e07-fd9e548c6778-0
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.463
There's a car, just go. I didn't
see that there's a car just

c4653549-f1f5-4726-8e07-fd9e548c6778-1
01:09:48.463 --> 01:09:52.834
pulling into right about the
intersection where the lady is

c4653549-f1f5-4726-8e07-fd9e548c6778-2
01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:53.490
about to.

5a683683-0035-4c9c-b581-a1d7ccdfff8a-0
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:58.841
Be ohh so the cars coming and
the motorcycle is coming. There

5a683683-0035-4c9c-b581-a1d7ccdfff8a-1
01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:02.760
might be an accident coming.
{OK, that's about it.}

93375f5f-9b41-4120-95e3-897961157f86-0
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.990
OK.

cd3dceb0-6b1b-490d-8efd-da4e74ed1acb-0
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.312
Well, I don't think the accident
happened. The ladies walked a

cd3dceb0-6b1b-490d-8efd-da4e74ed1acb-1
01:10:12.312 --> 01:10:13.910
little further. She might.

6ba353dc-0253-4a11-b1db-846b1956d47e-0
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.520
Ohh no, it's not her house.
She's looking at a house with 

40623004-6517-461e-84d7-03a3e799bef2-0
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.486
The sign in front of it that
says for sale it's very small

40623004-6517-461e-84d7-03a3e799bef2-1
01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:26.091
compared to the other houses, so
understanding under another

40623004-6517-461e-84d7-03a3e799bef2-2
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:26.860
street light.

abb98f86-1727-4664-89c5-72fdc3a07f50-0
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.502
Again, you can see people in
their windows. You can see a

abb98f86-1727-4664-89c5-72fdc3a07f50-1
01:10:36.502 --> 01:10:39.060
telescope up on the top of
someone's.

bddf74bd-d985-47a3-b7a8-f75ec0b9d611-0
01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:43.010
house on the rooftop.

3a170808-8598-4cf3-b4b0-497324d0b64d-0
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:44.960
Umm.

5f5d8373-caa2-44bd-825c-b0ed80b23051-0
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.570
I see a Man. Looks like he's
doing dishes and.

e5af81d9-e3c4-4377-aa1e-f1617c1b3adc-0
01:10:56.070 --> 01:11:01.933
Another man doing some painting
is that an easel got a palette

e5af81d9-e3c4-4377-aa1e-f1617c1b3adc-1
01:11:01.933 --> 01:11:04.540
and paints on it. There's a.

a249c051-5a4c-46d5-a856-886c811330c7-0
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.770
Staircase going into a building
with a striped awning.

cb952c24-0828-4003-b63a-e7f6e090072f-0
01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.090
Yeah.

c266c9f3-e799-4264-bda1-52e0ede19acf-0
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:15.830
Fire hydrant.

1659af4b-8114-4436-9035-e4be29d9b404-0
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:20.365
No woman's just standing there
looking at that house for sale.

1659af4b-8114-4436-9035-e4be29d9b404-1
01:11:20.365 --> 01:11:23.880
Maybe she's thinking it would be
a good place for her to live.

4900b962-640e-4969-9187-f64a8791a50a-0
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:28.200
{I can't think of too much
Josh.}

4bb51148-1b3d-475b-a91e-4da234b03c04-0
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.430
So now.

5f10c72f-14ac-4982-a162-cfd5cca174db-0
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:38.267
Well now that little house she
was looking at has been all

5f10c72f-14ac-4982-a162-cfd5cca174db-1
01:11:38.267 --> 01:11:42.813
spruced up. Someone must have
bought it. There's a man

5f10c72f-14ac-4982-a162-cfd5cca174db-2
01:11:42.813 --> 01:11:47.359
painting the shutters blue,
someone's painted the roof

5f10c72f-14ac-4982-a162-cfd5cca174db-3
01:11:47.359 --> 01:11:52.402
purple and the grass is now
growing and the sign doesn't say

5f10c72f-14ac-4982-a162-cfd5cca174db-4
01:11:52.402 --> 01:11:57.362
for sale anymore. And some
mailbox. The dog in the yard and

5f10c72f-14ac-4982-a162-cfd5cca174db-5
01:11:57.362 --> 01:11:58.850
everyone seems to.

bc96672e-c0cb-43ce-8c07-21bf7cc3a34c-0
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.000
Either be angry at that house or
admire that house.

d3a5f41d-19ce-45b4-bc9b-76d09c9834b8-0
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:09.300
Um, everything that's all
colorful. There's a beautiful

d3a5f41d-19ce-45b4-bc9b-76d09c9834b8-1
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.863
tree with flowers in it growing
above it, and everything else is

d3a5f41d-19ce-45b4-bc9b-76d09c9834b8-2
01:12:12.863 --> 01:12:15.440
black and white except the sky,
which is blue.

bd4b5a36-f749-4889-9933-ef69a760ac4b-0
01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:18.960
People are.

5938b1b6-13ce-415f-bac0-4dd473bcef43-0
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.440
Don't look very happy. There's
a.

4b8ffd3f-4390-449e-a1ee-ef9abc501167-0
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:25.750
Milkman, there's a.

5b58671a-779a-4703-bb5b-28baff689b42-0
01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:31.520
People that don't look very
happy.

2f16ed43-0b63-45a2-a563-ce51f9d40e3b-0
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.780
Men in a wheelchair.

f3e3905c-015b-4262-9302-e1013bc310e3-0
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:36.340
And.

b1bdf255-4be4-4109-b075-f5cb0dba8a4b-0
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.810
Car blaring its horn out there,
a man in a wheelchair. His leg

b1bdf255-4be4-4109-b075-f5cb0dba8a4b-1
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:43.350
seems to be in a cast.

a1132dfd-736f-47c7-a9f6-d00fc5c50328-0
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:47.090
A man with a helmet on a little
motorcycle.

fd05041b-2593-42d7-9750-7a8cf771eed6-0
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:55.018
There's two people sitting on a
bench, but I don't see anyone

fd05041b-2593-42d7-9750-7a8cf771eed6-1
01:12:55.018 --> 01:12:55.770
that looks.

5faadbce-107d-41e9-af5c-f56b0a7a6b13-0
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:57.450
Happy.

15573a07-5008-4132-bae3-c31934dbd324-0
01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.010
At all.

63f6a3e8-fe63-42ce-b57f-10a8365ed627-0
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.340
OK.

13ff56dd-5be4-4098-a67d-3a527d66b313-0
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.780
{You want me to say anything
else? OK, Ohh} and house is even

13ff56dd-5be4-4098-a67d-3a527d66b313-1
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.640
nicer now he's finished all the
shutters.

e34eb0b3-6e70-4f2d-82eb-82d47554c616-0
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.300
It's like he's.

e5c5014e-0daf-4dbd-83ca-915386e96efd-0
01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.990
Heading out the tree.

4a93cb99-7d41-41b5-8004-cea0a2d40159-0
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.309
Different color, I think. I
can't remember what color it

4a93cb99-7d41-41b5-8004-cea0a2d40159-1
01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:21.630
was, but now it's orange.

86b154b2-5441-441c-85b9-94a8cbf909f4-0
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:28.988
The chimney is beautiful. This
stones in the chimney look like

86b154b2-5441-441c-85b9-94a8cbf909f4-1
01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.050
gems, yeah?

1d3a69cd-acdb-4567-be38-eb3f1c77baa8-0
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:37.974
It's she's the only one I see. I
know there's a little fence with

1d3a69cd-acdb-4567-be38-eb3f1c77baa8-1
01:13:37.974 --> 01:13:38.760
flowers on it.

732dab43-479f-447f-8251-5de42759c160-0
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:41.090


96a22734-34f3-4dd3-b08f-4bf985639010-0
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.220
Yeah.

651b1d1a-4a1e-483c-a470-1dbe695e9dd4-0
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.740
Um, everywhere else. Let's see.
Oh, there is one other person.

89f5f1de-128d-4d15-9cbc-1289a45abf7c-0
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:53.174
who is in color, not black and
white. Everyone else is still

89f5f1de-128d-4d15-9cbc-1289a45abf7c-1
01:13:53.174 --> 01:13:56.582
doing what they were doing. I
mean, it's still doing dishes

89f5f1de-128d-4d15-9cbc-1289a45abf7c-2
01:13:56.582 --> 01:13:56.810
and.

93df29b5-c337-423a-b1ca-8087c23e4675-0
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.888
Everybody in it, everyone who's
that looks like a robber, looks

93df29b5-c337-423a-b1ca-8087c23e4675-1
01:14:02.888 --> 01:14:05.160
like a thief is thinking about.

6bee0990-d7d7-4740-aa18-39eb5bac2f01-0
01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:11.487
Going after into that house,
you're going to do something to

6bee0990-d7d7-4740-aa18-39eb5bac2f01-1
01:14:11.487 --> 01:14:15.367
that man, but still no one looks
very happy. But there is one

6bee0990-d7d7-4740-aa18-39eb5bac2f01-2
01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:19.310
little girl with a blue skirt
and a yellow shirt and red hair.

089af909-54b4-4677-b5de-69ea763be080-0
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:25.468
She's carrying something. Maybe
books. She doesn't look

089af909-54b4-4677-b5de-69ea763be080-1
01:14:25.468 --> 01:14:27.550
miserable anyway, and.

e967a20b-db92-4b04-a88e-b9088757113c-0
01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.990
The guy with the motorcycle,
he's still there.

b6ea0af2-a1fe-4f0c-8d01-fcc0f44cb1c7-0
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:33.310
All right.

1ba4b5b4-ab1f-4ae1-9cf5-7ebbb1e85083-0
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.540
Hmm.

560860ce-86ce-4854-bc38-25f92d2c0984-0
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:47.320
Well, now things are really
changing.

b1bb7848-55ea-4e76-82b1-0ee63807fe45-0
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.570
Umm.

71d3bc06-ec71-4ed1-9c96-d50b7f7d4502-0
01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.240
Everything's becoming more
colorful.

6ac27b28-29be-4202-af94-c7adf9c06ba8-0
01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:58.900
And.

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-0
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.854
The tiles of the roof, one roof
are all red and yellow now, and

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-1
01:15:05.854 --> 01:15:10.672
there's flowers in the flower
box, and the shutters are red on

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-2
01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:15.567
that house. And there's another
house where the awnings are now

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-3
01:15:15.567 --> 01:15:19.850
purple and white instead of
black and white, and people

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-4
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:24.897
still don't look very happy, but
there's a little more color. Oh,

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-5
01:15:24.897 --> 01:15:29.639
there's another. Oh, I didn't
even see that page. I wonder if

2a9e4a4d-fbf5-43a9-9918-b677b93209ce-6
01:15:29.639 --> 01:15:30.709
that happened.

20a11d73-52d7-40e2-b1cd-978d4f3e75b3-0
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:31.330
last time.

d1068ae2-8fb4-4780-8319-ed0266d91815-0
01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.270
If I only saw one page. Umm.

9bbe6d50-66d4-49d4-90b3-a65b799e428e-0
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.669
{Uh, OK. I don't know what else
to say about that page, but

9bbe6d50-66d4-49d4-90b3-a65b799e428e-1
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:44.953
going over here,} things are
coming alive. Now there's a

9bbe6d50-66d4-49d4-90b3-a65b799e428e-2
01:15:44.953 --> 01:15:45.479
moving.

0a340621-dc08-4125-adad-76da19a99e94-0
01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:48.460
Truck somebody's.

a02fcebc-295b-4fa8-b1e8-811549154c4a-0
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.885
Moving, I can't tell if you're
moving out or moving in,

a02fcebc-295b-4fa8-b1e8-811549154c4a-1
01:15:53.885 --> 01:15:54.440
frankly.

5d10e51b-3ae0-49a4-b618-1a01f4126fef-0
01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.750
But there's a mover.

6f382ebf-b3de-4f91-81ba-6e463dcf73e2-0
01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.450
And he is

36907989-68d5-429f-8c58-bb88f9fb7a6e-0
01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:02.134
Putting things in the truck or
taking things out of the truck,

36907989-68d5-429f-8c58-bb88f9fb7a6e-1
01:16:02.134 --> 01:16:04.578
people are looking, people are
interested. They want to know

36907989-68d5-429f-8c58-bb88f9fb7a6e-2
01:16:04.578 --> 01:16:05.220
what's going on.

8c1bd399-ca3d-467e-9850-826e07a39d4c-0
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:10.399
Oh, that man wasn't doing
dishes. He was in a bathtub. I

8c1bd399-ca3d-467e-9850-826e07a39d4c-1
01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.450
think he's got a rubber duck.

df366b7a-bff9-4c2e-af84-e7e64f1627b4-0
01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:14.980
Umm.

2ae483e8-e2bc-4488-afcd-1304a4635026-0
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.254
Let's see, there's a girl that
looks kind of happy up in her

2ae483e8-e2bc-4488-afcd-1304a4635026-1
01:16:19.254 --> 01:16:22.983
window. She's got a little dog.
She's a red hair. I don't know.

2ae483e8-e2bc-4488-afcd-1304a4635026-2
01:16:22.983 --> 01:16:26.362
She's on the telephone or
something. She's got flowers in

2ae483e8-e2bc-4488-afcd-1304a4635026-3
01:16:26.362 --> 01:16:27.470
her flower box and.

fbfdf67e-dc8e-479b-abb8-75fafaa851e5-0
01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:34.370
Um, there's the milkman looks
happy. He's smiling at the.

2de8bf08-b41b-46e1-bfc7-6835939f4fa5-0
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.430
It's a little boy who doesn't
look very happy.

40ef54dc-491e-45c0-94b0-5f8d5122bcec-0
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.885
Um, there's a pot with a red
plant. I don't know. OK, let's

40ef54dc-491e-45c0-94b0-5f8d5122bcec-1
01:16:42.885 --> 01:16:45.470
see if somebody's moving in or
moving out.

6244dce1-c44e-417b-a5eb-76e272ca562f-0
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.680
{OK, I just get those pages.}

a1847cba-ff4d-484c-b4cf-2e46708e9ee8-0
01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:55.720
{Just go smaller.}

ab285f5c-4dd4-413b-89a8-093fcde16d31-0
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:01.250
OK, well everything is in full
living color now.

d6d7f219-e274-40cc-8ddc-8e57cc3e3f39-0
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:09.126
Everything. This road is made of
beautiful colored stones. The

d6d7f219-e274-40cc-8ddc-8e57cc3e3f39-1
01:17:09.126 --> 01:17:14.741
roofs are beautiful colored
tiles. All the shutters are

d6d7f219-e274-40cc-8ddc-8e57cc3e3f39-2
01:17:14.741 --> 01:17:17.750
striped or bright red or blue.

715f43a1-17ef-4c41-b958-6a5f7bc91839-0
01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.077
Everybody seems to be smiling
now. The milkman is dancing with

715f43a1-17ef-4c41-b958-6a5f7bc91839-1
01:17:23.077 --> 01:17:24.670
the girl with the red hair.

6be5f9ff-761c-429e-8fb0-8601509ee3b0-0
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:28.930
Hmm.

d8a7d35c-be54-4397-b2a5-be26274fe005-0
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:33.679
In the yard of that little house
now is the man that was painting

d8a7d35c-be54-4397-b2a5-be26274fe005-1
01:17:33.679 --> 01:17:36.420
shutters, but also a woman and a
little child.

2a4d7eee-11b1-49b0-bab6-5eabcb9ee6a4-0
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:41.590
So, oh, he was grilling. Looks
like he was grilling food and.

5b0906bf-2fcd-4328-aab2-db7782e98fa2-0
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.584
Maybe he's giving it away. Maybe
that's why people are so happy.

5b0906bf-2fcd-4328-aab2-db7782e98fa2-1
01:17:46.584 --> 01:17:47.150
There is.

e18719e1-65eb-4a48-a3c9-4cc5934a3857-0
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:53.194
And there's a little boy, the
ball. He's showing it to his

e18719e1-65eb-4a48-a3c9-4cc5934a3857-1
01:17:53.194 --> 01:17:56.830
friends. He's got a dog. They
don't look too happy.

acf50ac8-331d-4726-a8b9-431849a898f5-0
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:02.140
Hmm.

af85e812-4b08-461b-8962-52c5c6227891-0
01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:05.420
There's some man.

e1751322-7c61-40cf-bd0a-0d5f293cc252-0
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:08.620
Who has? He's standing by us.

c50c4f91-aa1e-4fb8-8e50-b702d3ae00f8-0
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:10.000
Picture.

4242ab45-c543-4f23-a84c-46c34ad846f0-0
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.027
You know, frame on an easel and
I don't know if he's trying

4242ab45-c543-4f23-a84c-46c34ad846f0-1
01:18:14.027 --> 01:18:14.280
this.

b77d4385-bc42-42f2-b730-e14f57d9ed0a-0
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:19.544
Sell his paintings or what? And
there's a little sports car

b77d4385-bc42-42f2-b730-e14f57d9ed0a-1
01:18:19.544 --> 01:18:20.280
driving by.

d536f298-9007-43b3-a5ee-a39022bae6ae-0
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.880
And they are looking at the
picture.

fad10641-e1df-40ca-a39b-54f9868630e8-0
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:27.590
There's a clown in the distance
and.

c7cffed6-cba0-4354-8cab-7191548f3f82-0
01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.835
Little cart with flowers, but I
don't know who's selling the

c7cffed6-cba0-4354-8cab-7191548f3f82-1
01:18:31.835 --> 01:18:35.470
flowers. I don't think it's the
cloud. There's some balloons.

b62c10fd-14aa-4c79-991a-7985b86c481e-0
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:40.515
Clown probably has the balloons.
There's the mailman. He looks

b62c10fd-14aa-4c79-991a-7985b86c481e-1
01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:41.280
happy. Yeah.

20e9e1af-767f-468d-9362-1209ee0c132d-0
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:47.340
Oh, yeah, there's the painter.
OK. There's the painter upstairs

20e9e1af-767f-468d-9362-1209ee0c132d-1
01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:50.663
painting paintings. And the man
downstairs is selling them, I

20e9e1af-767f-468d-9362-1209ee0c132d-2
01:18:50.663 --> 01:18:51.360
guess, right.

137c94c1-334d-4609-a278-171a58659a41-0
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:54.340
So nice weather, all the windows
are open.

70b7ccfd-c558-42cb-a94b-cebf6ee4e5cb-0
01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.110
{I don't know what else to say.
Alright, I'll move on.}

8c8e09aa-30ec-43be-8ecc-18a75a31db2b-0
01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.210
Getting dark? Yeah, it doesn't
look quite so bright.

8bfe86fd-3486-43ba-b512-818c577c4325-0
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.310
Changing.

b9fe2a0f-0e1e-4177-930a-7c9bfb5f8661-0
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:16.194
We have a look at old sailor
with a big white beard up on up

b9fe2a0f-0e1e-4177-930a-7c9bfb5f8661-1
01:19:16.194 --> 01:19:16.890
on the.

45574b60-7163-4691-ae4c-a719b59c28cc-0
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:21.380
Top of 1 building that's looking
at this.

6555522f-c514-43bc-8c4c-e1ed31e719b5-0
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.538
Boy with him is looking at out
the telescope and they're

6555522f-c514-43bc-8c4c-e1ed31e719b5-1
01:19:26.538 --> 01:19:30.625
pointing at something. You see
something in the sky? I'm not

6555522f-c514-43bc-8c4c-e1ed31e719b5-2
01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:30.960
sure.

cc053343-a7df-4d74-84e1-c41e7731bb17-0
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:38.810
There's a clock above the door
of his building. It's 8:50.

7981d36e-6223-4eaf-a9d7-ef1be23e29cd-0
01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:46.244
There's a woman who she's the
first time I've seen her look

7981d36e-6223-4eaf-a9d7-ef1be23e29cd-1
01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:48.770
happy. The woman in the pink
dress is sitting.

dd941f4a-e486-49a5-9c79-e0d40f218c69-0
01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:56.841
Sitting with a man on the edge
of little pond milk truck is

dd941f4a-e486-49a5-9c79-e0d40f218c69-1
01:19:56.841 --> 01:20:03.502
parked under the orange tree.
The Purple House is all closed

dd941f4a-e486-49a5-9c79-e0d40f218c69-2
01:20:03.502 --> 01:20:03.830
up.

3d2cc8ae-d439-469e-84b4-cd6447a8c2c2-0
01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:09.846
Hmm. I don't see the old man or
the old woman or the child that

3d2cc8ae-d439-469e-84b4-cd6447a8c2c2-1
01:20:09.846 --> 01:20:12.420
lived there. Maybe they're
inside.

c46d5336-1e9e-4fd1-aee0-6af06bdd20ee-0
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:15.180
But their dog is outside.

cf93bf09-9cff-4645-a74f-5317ac769ef7-0
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:18.190
outside the fence. Hmm.

60fd7043-1343-4d8b-a1eb-ca858643571b-0
01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:22.958
Maybe they moved away. Yeah, and
that moving truck, I don't know.

60fd7043-1343-4d8b-a1eb-ca858643571b-1
01:20:22.958 --> 01:20:26.350
Maybe they moved away. If they
did, they left their dog behind.

1eca813f-a62e-473e-b242-64c1cf4f6821-0
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:29.960
{So what?}

34937fe3-4f43-45fe-be15-5af5ad93ef27-0
01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:36.690
{You can see that what? Oh, you
can see the the median.}

c30b3c31-aedc-4bd8-8055-bcf1ef027a46-0
01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:43.785
{Oh, there he is. Is that him?
Ohh, that's he's got on her

c30b3c31-aedc-4bd8-8055-bcf1ef027a46-1
01:20:43.785 --> 01:20:44.210
hat.}

97068e14-6851-4363-9259-d941a4f31b04-0
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.220
The old man.

8105ca0f-92a7-43f3-8e93-d2b2c4f55222-0
01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.891
Maybe that was never a woman in
the old man had, right? Because

8105ca0f-92a7-43f3-8e93-d2b2c4f55222-1
01:20:51.891 --> 01:20:55.424
he has a mustache, so it's a
man, but he's wearing the

8105ca0f-92a7-43f3-8e93-d2b2c4f55222-2
01:20:55.424 --> 01:20:58.700
flowered hat all. Maybe
something happened to her.

f7563df3-8939-4c89-83bb-47c88c7a99b5-0
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:01.890
Maybe something happened to the
woman.

2ac2718f-1297-451b-9048-dc0e4b947b0b-0
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:06.700
And he's leaving, but he left
the dog behind.

09750c5d-a9d1-4e94-acec-a4dfd751ac1c-0
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:08.700
Um.

9274ee6b-f47c-4620-a7b3-3f04cc2e120b-0
01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.135
Let's see. Is the painter still
there? The painter is gone.

9274ee6b-f47c-4620-a7b3-3f04cc2e120b-1
01:21:16.135 --> 01:21:17.880
Where's the painter?

b1040923-b34f-4518-856d-512a247ed6ea-0
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.920
No, no, we're not selling
paintings anymore.

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-0
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:27.062
And the man is done with his
bath. I don't see him. Where is

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-1
01:21:27.062 --> 01:21:30.801
he, that big guy? I don't see
him. So there's been some

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-2
01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:34.473
changes. There been some
changes. Wait a minute. Who's

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-3
01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:38.479
that old man and woman over
there? That's not the same man.

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-4
01:21:38.479 --> 01:21:42.818
There's a very sweet older man,
an older woman that they're just

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-5
01:21:42.818 --> 01:21:46.958
walking arm in arm. I I don't
know. I'm kind of curious. Am I

55ebc869-4028-4e41-b800-58a843e67698-6
01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:48.160
going to find out?

4c862d09-b5cc-4087-89ac-ef7eafdfb255-0
01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:49.950
{Yes.}

f8a7989a-87a5-469d-9002-f92cad97817e-0
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:52.280
{I don't know what else to say.}

6476cba4-e20f-495f-9298-f247576d3e2b-0
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.810
Oh, it's dark now.

6c633b40-8a8d-4363-8772-1d1ae4f57be2-0
01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:00.390
is that the hat.

f220a4aa-c3e1-4c18-aecb-56915144e1ca-0
01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.240
I don't see the flower in the
hat, but OK, it's dark now.

615b7968-2bca-47c6-878a-8f26759efec5-0
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.250
Where are we?

c0975763-cd01-4e1c-b31b-30c2906e01c7-0
01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:11.460
Another part of town.

3f738206-bf81-4a60-97e9-ce8d492ada4b-0
01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:17.168
You see people inside. We can
see some people outside. There's

3f738206-bf81-4a60-97e9-ce8d492ada4b-1
01:22:17.168 --> 01:22:20.754
a man on the motorcycle. He's
got a patch on his eye and a

3f738206-bf81-4a60-97e9-ce8d492ada4b-2
01:22:20.754 --> 01:22:21.970
bandana on his head.

b89d4c85-1195-46a2-8699-975287a55b0b-0
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.280
I can see that statue again of
the man on the horse.

3cc806fc-5d55-4132-87c7-3e54c8b7fab0-0
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:35.870
And the man's walking away.
Looks like he's maybe walking

3cc806fc-5d55-4132-87c7-3e54c8b7fab0-1
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:37.370
out toward that bridge again.

ad7faf02-16f1-44e7-b3b3-40f336b043b6-0
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:42.537
Again, I said it was a woman
before, but I think it's a man.

ad7faf02-16f1-44e7-b3b3-40f336b043b6-1
01:22:42.537 --> 01:22:44.230
I think you pointed him out.

26271afc-4354-40f7-acee-f86eb426b060-0
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.810
But everything's very colorful
still.

aa90ca40-2c6d-4c41-9fc2-37bafb77fcec-0
01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:55.266
I think I see the painter. At
least I see his. No, maybe not,

aa90ca40-2c6d-4c41-9fc2-37bafb77fcec-1
01:22:55.266 --> 01:22:55.480
no.

6129c84f-4684-4fea-98dc-64ade934a674-0
01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.830
It's sunset. The sun is going
down.

01c6c257-2603-42f6-9812-f2ca82776244-0
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.900
Hmm.

1ad03f2c-9a1a-4722-9ad4-1b9df66fb039-0
01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:13.550
Black and white again.

bb249511-546f-4c94-932e-61c86ec21fe6-0
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:18.500
The painter. The painter sitting
at the fountain.

8cae3485-5144-4edf-80d2-56192eaa4cac-0
01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:22.520
Dog nearby.

7a94e1b1-467f-4c2f-bb65-ad95b9013645-0
01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:28.921
A lot of people in there
buildings by the we can see them

7a94e1b1-467f-4c2f-bb65-ad95b9013645-1
01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:33.950
through the window and the man
found another house for sale.

955d52c4-7b02-4839-b561-c635728428e2-0
01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:36.860
And.

5ef0388f-dd0d-4b99-ad0f-72cd987428dc-0
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.774
Looking at a little ticket or
something, or a key, I don't

5ef0388f-dd0d-4b99-ad0f-72cd987428dc-1
01:23:43.774 --> 01:23:46.590
know what that is. There's a
different dog.

98e961eb-9d8d-4cd0-9d9c-9bec668c7582-0
01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:52.520
And there's a man that looks
really surprised looking at him

98e961eb-9d8d-4cd0-9d9c-9bec668c7582-1
01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.770
out the window. Man with glasses
and a pipe and a girl and a.

01:23:58.490 --> 01:24:02.418
Woman that look very surprised
looking out the window at him.

32a21313-31ab-4967-8aa9-11e71fbd8a70-1
01:24:02.418 --> 01:24:06.220
Looks like he might be going up
the steps to try to get in.

2f39d639-22a9-439b-bd0b-8c7313aa870e-0
01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:13.980
Oh, that's the flower from the
hat.

01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:19.290

That's it.}

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.430
Looks like the man.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.180
Is flower.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:29.790
with the girl

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:34.720
The flower from his hat which?

c62bb13a-495e-47bf-99f2-41cf5743dd5b-0
01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:41.120
#END_flowerman We'll never know,

c62bb13a-495e-47bf-99f2-41cf5743dd5b-1
01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:45.249
hat or and he's just wearing it,
or it was always his. I don't

c62bb13a-495e-47bf-99f2-41cf5743dd5b-2
01:24:45.249 --> 01:24:49.313
know, because we never really
did see the woman did. We can't

01:24:49.313 --> 01:24:53.049
remember anyway. And everybody
lived happily ever after.

It's way too crowded. I don't
know how any of those planes are

01:25:24.984 --> 01:25:28.080

From the plane to the airport or
from the airport to the plane,

The fire engine. Ohh there's a
small fire. No there wasn't a

Trucks pulling luggage behind.

e4f5ccbc-0cd1-4430-8bbc-e6067086cb70-0

eda9ceb6-128c-49ff-8b77-dfde6c6799bf-0
01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:40.807
There are planes in the air.
There's a biplane. There's a

eda9ceb6-128c-49ff-8b77-dfde6c6799bf-1
01:26:40.807 --> 01:26:41.970

I don't know what that is.

cc147da5-adf8-470b-ae40-a03ff2ad7d78-0
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.290
Maybe.

a85e4b65-d30b-44cd-b641-b93b39e04c64-0
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:53.903
I don't know really modern
looking plane. There are

01:26:53.903 --> 01:26:58.368
balloons, there are flags from
the countries flying on a

01:26:58.368 --> 01:27:00.640
helicopter near a helicopter.

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.877
Oh no, those flags are on poles.
Looks like the helicopter ran

17c1097f-9c69-4e6a-ac8e-7f765f6901ae-1
01:27:04.877 --> 01:27:05.820
into the flagpole.

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.490
There are people running on a
track.

01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:15.562
In the far distance I thought it
was a runway, but it looks like

74716f96-d213-49cf-861c-1c67721639c3-1
01:27:15.562 --> 01:27:17.840
there's four people running a
race.

01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:23.550
Did I say there's a blimp? I
don't know, I said.

957bacf6-c3bd-4622-bff2-ed9b2ada7221-0
01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.300

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:35.281
Controllers, air Traffic
controllers watch all the planes

492fe448-97f3-4542-937e-728330ffcf91-1
01:27:35.281 --> 01:27:40.995
that are coming and going. Like
there's three of them in there

492fe448-97f3-4542-937e-728330ffcf91-2

01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:47.572
So inside the airport, OK,
inside the airport we can see

ccaa2164-d538-4f85-818b-0f29c498415d-1
01:27:47.572 --> 01:27:48.960
the ticket counter.

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:57.011
And we can see the turnstile
where the luggage is coming in

74516626-2b89-463c-9cd1-6545803e600d-1
01:27:57.011 --> 01:28:00.930
and people are waiting to find
their luggage and.

c5394f98-5d1b-4957-9093-76266b663ad7-0
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:03.300
We can see a man.

f53c0f44-9670-4d79-9d6e-70613399e5ff-0
01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.105
Being checked by security, they
asked him to open his code and

f53c0f44-9670-4d79-9d6e-70613399e5ff-1
01:28:09.105 --> 01:28:09.530
he has.

01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:15.996
I don't think it's weapons. It's
just a bunch of watches in there

2d796e8c-f88e-4c20-99a7-f91a2674431d-1
01:28:15.996 --> 01:28:19.120
and I see a man with a briefcase
and I see.

e1bd0e99-2a4d-4996-b721-bb06a690e2f8-0
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:22.400
I see a man going through it. I
see one of the.

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:28.360
No office steward, but a worker
behind the counter going through

9175451a-cb32-45cb-a7e5-4a23fa33cbbe-1
01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.123
someone's suitcase, just
throwing his shirt and his book

9175451a-cb32-45cb-a7e5-4a23fa33cbbe-2
01:28:32.123 --> 01:28:33.840
and his things in the air.

2e04461b-7fc1-4108-aa14-b3383062126c-0
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:36.610
Eat.

f80308e7-e483-4f2e-9c2a-8abc56b6e68b-0
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.892
Were there any other checking
luggage in and they're picking

f80308e7-e483-4f2e-9c2a-8abc56b6e68b-1
01:28:42.892 --> 01:28:46.710
luggage up and there's a man
with a toy airplane and.

10771218-c137-4aaa-8ed7-550c67a4e5cf-0
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.220
Looks like something spilled
all.

26d231ee-1512-4863-8df9-41488a104282-0
01:28:52.450 --> 01:28:56.391
Maybe there was a fire. Oh yeah,
there was a fire. And they

26d231ee-1512-4863-8df9-41488a104282-1
01:28:56.391 --> 01:29:00.529
sprayed foam. Looks like they
sprayed foam to put the fire out

26d231ee-1512-4863-8df9-41488a104282-2
01:29:00.529 --> 01:29:02.040
all those boxes. Maybe.

7cb5ba7b-0b1e-485d-a0c2-9abace0e13f0-0
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.380
#END_airport Then they sprayed
the people.

{Move back to good here and then
we'll move on to our last item

6c7ac579-63ff-4aaa-af82-09ff509ceee9-1
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:16.420
for today, OK.}

#START_escape_from_the_zoo All
right. We're at the zoo.

c68a7f23-476c-43f6-ab79-7513e676e81c-1
01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:24.990
Obviously, we're at the zoo.

here. OK, there's a.}

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:35.330
There's a tree, and in the tree
looks like.

8ccebc5e-026e-4de8-8164-2528c5042912-0
01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.448
They look like raccoons, but
they're huge, so they're

8ccebc5e-026e-4de8-8164-2528c5042912-1
01:29:40.448 --> 01:29:45.451
probably something different.
And I don't think raccoons go in

8ccebc5e-026e-4de8-8164-2528c5042912-2
01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:46.960
trees maybe anyway.

ea6584de-2a4d-4a34-baf4-c369dd746e8c-0
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:53.936
Uh, I see an elephant in the
distance. And an ostrich. And

ea6584de-2a4d-4a34-baf4-c369dd746e8c-1
01:29:53.936 --> 01:29:58.365
some polar bears. 2 3 polar
bears, one of them's in the

water.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:05.460
I see couple of zebra and
flamingos.

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.361
Kangaroo. I see it hopping. I
can't tell if there's a baby in

91d21114-5b44-466c-954e-98f69f8dd041-1
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:22.183
that pouch. Maybe I see a couple
of workers and they've got a

91d21114-5b44-466c-954e-98f69f8dd041-2
01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:25.820
net. They must be trying to
catch something. Something got

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.190
loose.

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:33.677
What other? I see a lion, a male
and a female I see a Maybe a

01:30:33.677 --> 01:30:38.561
Gopher or a Prairie dog in a
hole and another one coming up

01:30:38.561 --> 01:30:40.189

They're not really very

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:48.635
interesting. I see a Peacock. I
see a baby carriage. It's a

01:30:48.635 --> 01:30:52.318

01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:02.133
Big rhinoceros running loose.
People look a little frightened.

01:31:02.133 --> 01:31:06.090
2 giraffes, 3 giraffes, an Ant
eater? A little.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.230
Little plane parrot.

Chimps. I don't know. What

01:31:16.869 --> 01:31:20.871
they're maybe twice Gorilla. I
see a big gorilla, and then

01:31:20.871 --> 01:31:25.075
maybe those are little gorillas.
See a city in the background

01:31:25.075 --> 01:31:29.483

distance. And.

01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:36.930
What is that animal back there?
Is that another rhinoceros?

that}. Other benches. There's a

relaxing. There's a child with a
mask. Well, let's see what else.

aba7b5c2-effa-4ab5-96c3-24db69976fc8-0

Some kind of animal with antlers
I don't.

people in line for ice cream.
Somebody is feeding the animals
