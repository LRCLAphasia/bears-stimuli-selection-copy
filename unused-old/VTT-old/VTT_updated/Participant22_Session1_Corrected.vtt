ahead. OK, I guess they get to

f37ccdbd-1256-4757-a4ba-9e6d8937aa86-1
01:00:27.895 --> 01:00:30.820
OK. I guess they made it to the
submarine.

a133690b-dc2e-438d-9fc2-e870a74299fa-0
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:35.040
They come out of the submarine.

5460df64-b40b-4c72-b532-c285c0aa8d7d-0
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.060
There's a purple phoenix.

8bb9193e-187d-47db-a867-9ae2ea29da2c-0
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.040
Into a cave.

aced86bf-2865-476d-9909-d7034ca83a97-0
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:44.850
They're going to go. They're
going to go explore.

3e578811-b5d1-4835-972f-2d9fea5648a7-0
01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.030
Now.

2cc82e0b-f8d6-4dea-bee9-90d2d0535f7d-0
01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:04.502
They're going to, they're coming
to the end. They can just be

2cc82e0b-f8d6-4dea-bee9-90d2d0535f7d-1
01:01:04.502 --> 01:01:05.900
coming to the destination.

1c86a1b6-3e2b-4d3f-a9b4-e38d456013ae-0
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.000
 because the purple

cbf4613e-4c9d-4c88-b860-725a27b6c349-0
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.340
Seeing where he was.

a184288d-da09-45d6-b2a1-ef85869622ae-0
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.650
We will.

546d3526-2a5c-436e-b63f-db75a05da78a-0
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:23.760
We're going up with the small
door, small door, entrance way

5ac56106-c0a6-4f8d-95a2-aa43da240ff2-0
01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.330
OK.

165bf2f3-7e78-4970-a8ad-7ce4f0332c56-0
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:31.260
So the girl says go up. But
anyway, they go up.

cf2223df-ff12-43ee-913e-611f652031ce-0
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.635
And they're looking to see this.
They're going up and there's

cf2223df-ff12-43ee-913e-611f652031ce-1
01:01:36.635 --> 01:01:38.350
this knows that it's far up.

d650b1de-5601-4b1e-b8dc-ef0d5b1934cf-0
01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.150
The higher they go.

2bac8971-ec09-441d-9322-783d78f939e8-0
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:44.680
Purple bird watching, too.

8276ce13-c422-4e10-a4d5-ef25cb3ba484-0
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.490


813bee00-e192-4425-9103-489c881b7b71-0
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.740
So I guess they're on their way.

0b7c442e-3290-4e30-b317-e6bee8614d58-0
01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.400
Explore The Cave that's a long
pictures on the wall.

9aa1aed2-11d6-43c3-baff-59f06e462720-0
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.950
Yeah, so there's different type
of paintings on the wall.

d8d419a1-31cc-48a7-9b8c-0fa90cf661b0-0
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:16.290
Close to light house.

3c9836f7-8ade-49d4-9aeb-0b1229482e33-0
01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:18.760
Viking.

f22c37ce-589c-4727-ac3f-09f87c82ffc5-0
01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.420


845aa6de-743b-4fa6-a9fa-90b43994ef10-0
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.700
So there's a bird in the cage.

22f15c5c-a086-4e24-8ce8-fd6e0a92174a-0
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:38.055
I guess the bird didn't catch
and now he's being harassed or

22f15c5c-a086-4e24-8ce8-fd6e0a92174a-1
01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:39.060
something like that.

1b829446-697f-4986-a976-974993636d35-0
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.040
Guess I'll know we're gonna
attack or what?

0a67d0be-e3cd-4fb9-9619-6d9d753c0765-0
01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.090
I guess, um.

396586df-c10b-48f5-9fa4-e1c2d1a36937-0
01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.130
Now

a11b2709-3dac-41d6-81eb-619c65d1bbbf-0
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.172
When the guy in the armor shoot
come chasing the bird in the

a11b2709-3dac-41d6-81eb-619c65d1bbbf-1
01:03:06.172 --> 01:03:09.390
cage, he gets trapped inside of
the cage.

26197555-f69d-4005-bce8-b6ffd225bf82-0
01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:10.590
Hmm.

dc9459b1-fcd3-45ba-9fdd-d8c016d2025c-0
01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.570
And when he's inside of the
door, slam shut.

4321bfb1-52c3-47aa-aec9-3e4ecb1680dd-0
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.380
No more.

66e6d381-6e4d-4f33-9ca8-783e0faf2eb6-0
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.120
OK.

42c0d422-5789-4298-bceb-884acd8f46ea-0
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.210
Umm.

2daf9582-f477-4d7c-ba22-60f6ddc3bd12-0
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:37.306
There was a kind of a bird or
some type of phoenix and some

2daf9582-f477-4d7c-ba22-60f6ddc3bd12-1
01:03:37.306 --> 01:03:42.080
rear land. Maybe they can get
transported back.

e0b7b83b-1d21-4270-921f-3eea2b2f0ed9-0
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.060
Yeah.

6637e973-e26e-4c08-914c-bbda4e042dfa-0
01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:47.000
Being unfaithful.

e677ef00-95f4-49bd-bf13-c432d0eee70e-0
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.750
{Say no, I'm sorry.}

500d3ba5-5723-43a9-a9f2-fb49ab19b865-0
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.790
They they they come back.

792fa9b5-bc1e-49fa-85ce-0174c5d58dfe-0
01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:01.355
As soon as they come out of
book, they see somebody in the

792fa9b5-bc1e-49fa-85ce-0174c5d58dfe-1
01:04:01.355 --> 01:04:04.330
cage. I guess they opened the
book and maybe.

329e7cab-5898-462a-b2b2-44bb7bd0b4ea-0
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.180
Something came out to help him.

8ac6eedb-604f-4568-8149-b848fb7e8b96-0
01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:10.130
See butterflies.

44b5a1c7-540e-48f3-8914-6ca7ef81c8e0-0

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.250
guess come out of The Cave small
door.

ac3b177e-56fd-4a1c-bfaa-7190150eb99e-0

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:40.580
King's Original King is watching
them with crayons on their head.

e28eea16-1e26-4004-8ac9-664f1756f6c8-0
01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.010
Purple

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.380
bird

cc1bdd91-64ae-49e8-aa7e-10477ba40ab4-0
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.230
Doors closing.

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:58.810
Small little doors closing to
that wall.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:06.690
Getting dark, I guess. close,
maybe down the steps we go.

74c87936-a8f2-4bb6-85c2-1e0d8b8aac56-0

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.340
There's the kite. The kite goes
out of the small door.

73d67941-a088-4e83-8bfc-989350d990e8-0
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.970
Down the stairs, down the house.
