I don't see anything else
notable.

0353897d-fa79-4038-bc6a-50cf64e3af31-0
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.230
{Oh, do you want me to?}

c7b68acc-0378-4ea4-8290-d9eea22a4d2e-0
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.360
{Thank you.}

d4ca55a7-ab40-4b9e-9bfd-a893157598be-0
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.050
{Anything, yeah.}

c15211ae-0157-4fbc-8c89-4acf599eebfb-0
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.419
Can see the from a different
angle. Looking down on it from

c15211ae-0157-4fbc-8c89-4acf599eebfb-1
00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.465
above, it seems to be maybe the
same evening, you know? It's

c15211ae-0157-4fbc-8c89-4acf599eebfb-2
00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:01.919
dark and gloomy and misty and
Greek.

9c97d225-ea3c-4fa8-a894-1538589cf1f2-0
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.787
There was an old lady that were
carrying old bag lady with a

9c97d225-ea3c-4fa8-a894-1538589cf1f2-1
00:07:06.787 --> 00:07:10.594
funny hat and the fur stole
around The Walking down the

9c97d225-ea3c-4fa8-a894-1538589cf1f2-2
00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:12.430
middle of the street there.

346f2c3c-45dd-445b-8d34-7228202edcbb-0
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.460
Two people on a balcony.

dc0bb955-5092-449b-8762-63a70a13011b-0
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.000
Or at least, maybe it's the
father some other is wearing a.

8cb9b7c0-66e5-49f1-984d-c5f2da88a9fa-0
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.580
a tee.

07971769-a849-4d7c-bf54-d938626c5ed5-0
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.440
So it can't be so very cold that
I can't see any smoking out of

07971769-a849-4d7c-bf54-d938626c5ed5-1
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.275
the chimneys in this one. So
maybe a different evening and

07971769-a849-4d7c-bf54-d938626c5ed5-2
00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:35.770
we're back at the cafe.

aa297197-af9a-45c8-830f-765f0cd163db-0
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.088
Don't know, there's to say one a
different cafe with four windows

aa297197-af9a-45c8-830f-765f0cd163db-1
00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:45.370
above, with the shutters open so
we can see the rooms inside.

aa297197-af9a-45c8-830f-765f0cd163db-2
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.652
There's a not well slouching
himself on the wall by the steps

aa297197-af9a-45c8-830f-765f0cd163db-3
00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:53.796
entrance to the cafe against
lounging with leaning with his

aa297197-af9a-45c8-830f-765f0cd163db-4
00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:57.594
hands in his pocket. Maybe
smoking a cigarette I don't

aa297197-af9a-45c8-830f-765f0cd163db-5
00:07:57.594 --> 00:07:57.940
know.

d0c60e1e-9700-404b-b2de-7a32d56f363c-0
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.917
We have another fellow looking
quite, quite reasonable,

d0c60e1e-9700-404b-b2de-7a32d56f363c-1
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:06.970
pleasant sort of young chef,
looking at off his balcony at

d0c60e1e-9700-404b-b2de-7a32d56f363c-2
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.230
the bottom right of the screen,
looking at that he cannot see.

e65f3a6c-2c6b-45a2-8e65-2134275d1722-0
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.250
And the cat is sitting on the
balcony railing next to him.

988a5339-7711-402c-96de-bbc0593fd49f-0
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.420
With a motor car.

da4e3f74-a40f-4d44-8e38-d4131acdedde-0
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.924
OK. I think pickup truck with
two people inside and they're

da4e3f74-a40f-4d44-8e38-d4131acdedde-1
00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:24.700
driving towards the old lady.

73081e6b-f999-4948-a74f-123835f97a50-0
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.598
Motorcycle that is coming from
the other direction and a small

73081e6b-f999-4948-a74f-123835f97a50-1
00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:30.660
child abatement.

4a1635f8-cadf-4fad-84fa-e8db33b65a05-0
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.160
The rather impressive statue of
the.

260400be-dd90-499b-b6df-138cec33b5dc-0
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.083
Cavalier Type fellow was astride
a horse. It's rearing up and

260400be-dd90-499b-b6df-138cec33b5dc-1
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.720
it's on his hind leg.

0a1fd673-992e-43f0-aeec-6710d3c58b0a-0
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.342
It's either snowing or there are
distant starr stars showing in

0a1fd673-992e-43f0-aeec-6710d3c58b0a-1
00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:52.560
the in the blackness.

aa56a58f-0dde-42f1-99a7-ab7ef27cb042-0
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.625
I just noticed in the in the far
distance you're gonna lean

aa56a58f-0dde-42f1-99a7-ab7ef27cb042-1
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.270
everything.

87396887-d9dd-46ec-b1c9-c7537d79af72-0
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.340
Looks like this the top of a
roof.

76c4b6d5-057b-4f89-8bf0-3fc63969441f-0
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.970
Which may be on the next screen.

8017e864-da52-4ce2-be5f-aa94a4d20d0b-0
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.680
What is another busy scene is a
two page printout for overnight.

4d7a94e7-d3b3-429c-b22d-af93fe9a4d39-0
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.389
And it's largely black and
white. And the old lady, it is

4d7a94e7-d3b3-429c-b22d-af93fe9a4d39-1
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:28.730
either a lady or a man holding
the bags. Blue hat.

d346cd87-ad14-4a9c-95cf-98fdea7afc7e-0
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.570
She seems to be.

49c81346-912f-436d-b5c5-5d4810756846-0
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.510
Colored in everybody else is in
white

3367c375-320e-4d24-80da-e77b22642e8b-0
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.630
She's approaching.

026bc7cc-9342-4756-af7b-0430306675e6-0
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.120
Small House of from from the
sidewalk standing in the street

026bc7cc-9342-4756-af7b-0430306675e6-1
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.951
lamp next to a might be the cafe
from a different angle with a

026bc7cc-9342-4756-af7b-0430306675e6-2
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:47.290
sign saying Coca-Cola.

7c6516cf-5d53-471a-9f07-b10f8d2fb17a-0
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.340
With the old man sitting on a
chair outside of.

91abc97b-98be-44cd-b868-0462d57a6580-0
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:58.369
Above the doorway to the door
the clock says 730, presumably

91abc97b-98be-44cd-b868-0462d57a6580-1
00:09:58.369 --> 00:09:59.310
evening, so.

710aa5f0-21ae-4537-835d-588ea838dff0-0
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.159
Winter scene, there's a top of
that building, there's an open

710aa5f0-21ae-4537-835d-588ea838dff0-1
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:07.918
window you can see here can do
the female persons living in a

710aa5f0-21ae-4537-835d-588ea838dff0-2
00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:11.375
child. Above that there's
another window open and we can

710aa5f0-21ae-4537-835d-588ea838dff0-3
00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:15.013
look in that room and I can't
see what it's showing me, but

710aa5f0-21ae-4537-835d-588ea838dff0-4
00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:17.559
there's a telescope on top of
that thing.

660fd67c-dd9e-4ddc-ab94-98c0c4ebeda1-0
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.638
So maybe they are stars and not
snowflakes and we're looking for

660fd67c-dd9e-4ddc-ab94-98c0c4ebeda1-1
00:10:23.638 --> 00:10:27.870
left to right along the street.
See the, the, the, the, the.

2f003924-1aca-46c9-a6c8-7515a95a74bb-0
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.650
Chinese girlfriend arm his arm
around her shoulder.

d413cd83-47cc-4c19-abf2-a33700698f27-0
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.920
Peering from the side of what is
probably the cafe.

df02fe76-6757-4f35-8468-75f3d04158fe-0
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.390
The streets are cobble streets
with other.

7974728e-67db-4b69-9eb1-5b19b31c2464-0
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.088
Pedestrian only, cobble , but
the people you look close to,

7974728e-67db-4b69-9eb1-5b19b31c2464-1
00:10:46.088 --> 00:10:48.790
there's quite a few people out
at

6959986f-cc5d-4551-8035-65dd88908417-0
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.620
7:30 there's a fountain.

0b313f75-c68e-4aac-b614-455fa4a82a7a-0
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.295
And there's two people on
fellows sitting on the edge of

0b313f75-c68e-4aac-b614-455fa4a82a7a-1
00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:57.120
the fountain

e0225c53-b482-4bd7-87b4-a6fcde4ba5c9-0
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.218
With the resting his chin on his
hand with a small child next to

e0225c53-b482-4bd7-87b4-a6fcde4ba5c9-1
00:11:02.218 --> 00:11:02.490
him.

c4c6baaa-c022-4320-ac3f-de885a44bc93-0
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.850
I mean, seems to be splashing in
the water.

563acbd9-1ec1-48e4-a463-4dbdfcd118dc-0
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.290
There's a couple going into a
building.

5b952af8-c07b-4bb7-82df-eeb4752d5567-0
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.465
Doesn't say what sort of
building it is. Maybe a hotel i

5b952af8-c07b-4bb7-82df-eeb4752d5567-1
00:11:19.465 --> 00:11:20.160
don't know

a006657f-ad9f-49f9-88eb-9a70fce30dc6-0
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.854
And the open window above the
front door to that building,

a006657f-ad9f-49f9-88eb-9a70fce30dc6-1
00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:26.590
there's a person in that room.

d2cdf9cc-f0ea-4ffe-8e05-949c327b99fc-0
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.352
Building the left of that, going
back towards the old lady again

d2cdf9cc-f0ea-4ffe-8e05-949c327b99fc-1
00:11:32.352 --> 00:11:36.060
as a grand stairs, going up to
the main entrance and.

5b489f70-6332-4bf1-862c-ec26e3841c86-0
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.642
Looks to be in disrepair I
believe, but it seems to have

5b489f70-6332-4bf1-862c-ec26e3841c86-1
00:11:39.642 --> 00:11:41.730
people in every room. Maybe it's
a hotel.

6ee26228-66df-4780-a2b0-a79312a26290-0
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.969
The next building over the very
peculiar roofline it seems to

6ee26228-66df-4780-a2b0-a79312a26290-1
00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:51.210
be.

c44da3a4-d814-414b-8d4b-ce5b71962942-0
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.576
Corkscrew shaped lot of tiles,
all the peculiarity and there

c44da3a4-d814-414b-8d4b-ce5b71962942-1
00:11:57.576 --> 00:11:59.530
isn't smoke in the chimneys.

40092838-bd16-4f19-bbe4-c9a3b34d888b-0
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.750
There. Maybe it is. It's the
same day as earlier.

73efae92-08cd-47de-9c9a-fd674e233b95-0
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.590
There's two.

4c1d566e-904a-4129-a761-f990f65a7f1d-0
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.851
Chaps to talking to each other
on the street corner, one like

4c1d566e-904a-4129-a761-f990f65a7f1d-1
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.983
Richard Nixon and the other one
one of the Mario brothers off

4c1d566e-904a-4129-a761-f990f65a7f1d-2
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.049
that video game.

c7ad0576-6122-4655-bab1-29be2d4ac073-0
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.324
Probably, just maybe. So go
overplaying under the street

c7ad0576-6122-4655-bab1-29be2d4ac073-1
00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:20.860
lights.

fa6db0a8-ceb0-4881-8546-4d7aa5fb26e4-0
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.720
Yeah, that's about all I can see
from this.

bbf24ea7-1ced-414b-8349-d14741b972d4-0
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.500
Interesting there.

e1d42f47-d500-435e-9b23-954542c145ad-0
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.153
Right with daytime blue skies
and some like pale white cloud

e1d42f47-d500-435e-9b23-954542c145ad-1
00:12:39.153 --> 00:12:39.680
cover.

a1c83ebe-904b-47aa-a2db-2f1f591aa57f-0
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.530
Lots of.

677cb46d-aec5-4f85-a932-065d9db50996-0
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.890
Treetops the building with the
box screw image and last.

81fbbeaf-a8a3-4357-a8b3-d4eda3b76ac4-0
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.510

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.567
That we're going to go down from
the top down this time. I think

513065cf-08ac-4381-9b64-92eb24f53c4e-1

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.425
The street lights are turned
off. It's a bright sunny day and

783e0b74-e35f-45d8-8ef9-01d7b33014e2-1
00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:19.870

The old Fellow sitting in front
of the probably cafe. It was

00:19:26.044 --> 00:19:29.150
come to, we get more and more
coloured in.

95d4e9bc-4bdd-4d6f-b876-4df201e739db-0
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.117
So the top left of the image,
the the building with the

95d4e9bc-4bdd-4d6f-b876-4df201e739db-1
00:19:34.117 --> 00:19:37.779
telescope atop it, has a cat
there now. So that's coming to

95d4e9bc-4bdd-4d6f-b876-4df201e739db-2
00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.000
see what's going on.

ec990f3f-162c-449b-aa0f-5bbf06323b50-0
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.868
Unless it's more monkeys, I
think it's a cat. They've all

ec990f3f-162c-449b-aa0f-5bbf06323b50-1
00:19:42.868 --> 00:19:44.450
got colourful rules. Very nice.

d1fade43-36ec-46b9-8d97-96deecf9d430-0
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.510
Going down that building again,
that that that the fat woman was

d1fade43-36ec-46b9-8d97-96deecf9d430-1
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.150
still in the window and not
quite sure what she's doing.

44530db9-09ae-4c5e-9f7d-5d2e087a1ecb-0
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.207
The drinking is a fallen off the
glass. I don't know what time it

44530db9-09ae-4c5e-9f7d-5d2e087a1ecb-1
00:19:56.207 --> 00:19:59.915
is. Well, there's an old man
being being hugged by his old

44530db9-09ae-4c5e-9f7d-5d2e087a1ecb-2
00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:03.811
child. It's the child with the
blue skirt and the yellow top.

44530db9-09ae-4c5e-9f7d-5d2e087a1ecb-3
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:05.760
She's now hugging that old man.

5f1077ec-0763-4cc1-811c-344553b708f0-0
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.515
The other old boy sitting on the
chair outside the building is

5f1077ec-0763-4cc1-811c-344553b708f0-1
00:20:09.515 --> 00:20:10.400
still there still.

1c95e043-a8a1-4567-b746-da16a15cb9f3-0
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.620
Looking vacantly out in the
distance, he seems really nice

1c95e043-a8a1-4567-b746-da16a15cb9f3-1
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.160
enough. Old fellow, wearing
spectacles, got the jacket and

1c95e043-a8a1-4567-b746-da16a15cb9f3-2
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.700
tie on. Sitting on a chair,
there's one. All those things.

1c95e043-a8a1-4567-b746-da16a15cb9f3-3
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.880
Quite a number of people going
about their business.

8c38701a-f236-4e95-9457-fa460a7f4c64-0
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.620
Through the left or right.

3342cdce-c354-46fa-9512-797e23da0feb-0
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:38.038
Spawn in each of the open
windows. I'm sure that anyone's

3342cdce-c354-46fa-9512-797e23da0feb-1
00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:39.220
doing anything.

5b96d104-8077-43bb-9f14-98564903ca38-0
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.190
Spectacularly unusual. the
artist

5a5a166c-2495-42c9-a3f5-742e925f7e9b-0
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.554
Seems to be holding his burdens
into we having a brush draw.

5a5a166c-2495-42c9-a3f5-742e925f7e9b-1
00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:49.200
Doesn't seem to have an easel.

4c6c5964-2598-49b6-8882-1572c6b12e4c-0
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.280
The removal company they appear
to be.

133a3972-a3d8-401a-94ea-c6dc06973a1f-0
00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:02.830
Taking things into the van and
the developer, Big Fat.

3ab5b781-b786-4f04-aa27-25ab7ee6b392-0
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.450
Industrialist, the bow tie and
a.

1dd34b47-d2ec-4a3a-8e1b-284eb63b89a7-0
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.458
Ways goes, technicals looking
very imperious, and I wonder

1dd34b47-d2ec-4a3a-8e1b-284eb63b89a7-1
00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:15.853
whether he's evicting someone on
one of these SLAM properties and

1dd34b47-d2ec-4a3a-8e1b-284eb63b89a7-2
00:21:15.853 --> 00:21:16.120
the.

42a53f74-8629-4964-865e-f1ce2d9f0109-0
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.515
Anyway, all the possessions into
the interview removal, that is,

42a53f74-8629-4964-865e-f1ce2d9f0109-1
00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:24.840
movers and shakers carrying.

e8160105-6b68-4c38-b6cc-b9e4971b00a1-0
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.850
Packages.

b9c06dc4-aace-4b13-9149-11cbf4918c4e-0
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.530
The fat man with the with the
with the fancy coat as a small

b9c06dc4-aace-4b13-9149-11cbf4918c4e-1
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.550
child that's standing next to
him.

89a8c165-e3e1-492d-848d-c212057fcfe7-0
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.575
Everyone else seems to be
ignoring him, but he's just

89a8c165-e3e1-492d-848d-c212057fcfe7-1
00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:47.739
going on. Everyone's doing their
own thing. There's no

89a8c165-e3e1-492d-848d-c212057fcfe7-2
00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:49.580
interaction necessarily between.

24e87436-a282-4f72-8ae4-054a59476e3e-0
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.240
Any of the people in the scene.

dd0a57ef-f789-4ecd-b523-1ccd868e1122-0
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.801
Both of them, they're just
beginning with their own lives

dd0a57ef-f789-4ecd-b523-1ccd868e1122-1
00:21:55.801 --> 00:21:58.473
and looking out of the window
and half heartedly watching

dd0a57ef-f789-4ecd-b523-1ccd868e1122-2
00:21:58.473 --> 00:21:59.210
what's going on.

5c1214fa-ddc1-4704-99d9-4cdc19b647b0-0
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:04.280
With no no direction much? Yeah,
there's an old boy.

37d85052-ed0f-4279-ab36-f291738206df-0
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.677
In a blue shirt with his arm on
the shoulders of either an old

37d85052-ed0f-4279-ab36-f291738206df-1
00:22:09.677 --> 00:22:11.170
lady with spectacles.

38ba1d52-45a7-46ac-8c02-de011c0e797a-0
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.380
I think so. In a green jacket.

bcbe1364-7eaa-4d5f-9336-adcf01efe397-0
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.680
No.

4164021d-472e-4ec9-a8c1-b8f31628bd7d-0
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.367
The man in this shirt and tired
to color that doesn't have a

4164021d-472e-4ec9-a8c1-b8f31628bd7d-1
00:22:20.367 --> 00:22:24.000
jacket anyway. Perhaps he's
writing something down in a

4164021d-472e-4ec9-a8c1-b8f31628bd7d-2
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.050
notepad as he's looking down the
street scene.

7f6aa8f9-f50a-4a40-bf2b-6a1e9acc557a-0
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.789
The two men loading the other
boys. Or maybe the same boys

7f6aa8f9-f50a-4a40-bf2b-6a1e9acc557a-1
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:34.780
still playing in the Phantom.

752be6bb-0413-482e-8ff8-6572ad2e920d-0
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.020
Playing with paper sailing boats
maps.

8367a1ba-3bd0-4e5b-b03e-a076a88785f5-0
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.490
No, that's all I can get from
this one.

517c7b35-db7a-4a1b-8229-ccd7901048ea-0
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.719
Ohh no that kinda just noticed
another. Yeah, the the the

517c7b35-db7a-4a1b-8229-ccd7901048ea-1
00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:58.745
building with the telescope on
the roof. There's a old man with

517c7b35-db7a-4a1b-8229-ccd7901048ea-2
00:22:58.745 --> 00:23:02.583
a big beard, bald like and bushy
side bits at the top of his

517c7b35-db7a-4a1b-8229-ccd7901048ea-3
00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:06.610
board. He's he looks like an old
professor, so maybe that's his

517c7b35-db7a-4a1b-8229-ccd7901048ea-4
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.190
telescope. We'll find out later
perhaps.

90353612-29e4-4c70-a107-00608148625d-0
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.320
{Next please.}

32413bd1-41a4-46ae-82e6-6fe8eaf8c6b3-0
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:23.320
{Again.}

1d859748-f58e-4a2c-a501-dc7287e700a2-0
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.290
{Ohh yes ohh did it not.}

05839381-f730-4612-b8b2-0a49a4f376f4-0
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.160
{There you go. OK, perfect.
Yeah.}

f959cf7f-f135-45ee-abd4-8c4144cd41ea-0
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.680
{I don't know. We we got it.}

35ed3518-a555-4de3-a1cf-ae9da8919309-0
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.652
The man disappeared from his
window. The the underneath the

35ed3518-a555-4de3-a1cf-ae9da8919309-1
00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:42.170
the rooftop, the telescope on
it.

6e5377f2-fa91-446c-b566-d808d8852ff1-0
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.024
So someone put a window box with
flowers and then next to the

6e5377f2-fa91-446c-b566-d808d8852ff1-1
00:23:47.024 --> 00:23:47.630
telescope.

b8339834-aaad-4110-920e-74cd2a7bc026-0
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.120
Since the previous image going
down there within that one was

b8339834-aaad-4110-920e-74cd2a7bc026-1
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.642
left the window, there's no on
the other side when there's

b8339834-aaad-4110-920e-74cd2a7bc026-2
00:23:56.642 --> 00:23:58.970
green sofa there but no sitting
on it.

f23857d9-aadb-42fe-9ec7-0b6d850ec511-0
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.140
The book now says.

c5ca795f-6e32-4b35-8398-ab1878893b1b-0
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.380
Similar to take last four.

476bbf57-d6f0-4617-82f8-68f80cdf1d59-0
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.380
 the old boy sitting he, still
sitting on his chair in that

476bbf57-d6f0-4617-82f8-68f80cdf1d59-1
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.170
every image.

ead53a6c-0a4c-4a53-8323-aa2778298ad0-0
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.130
The fellow playing guitar, you
asking about that building, the

ead53a6c-0a4c-4a53-8323-aa2778298ad0-1
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.848
milkman has moved and he's in
front of that building. Or his

ead53a6c-0a4c-4a53-8323-aa2778298ad0-2
00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:23.749
truck is and the milkman dancing
with the girl with the Red Hat

ead53a6c-0a4c-4a53-8323-aa2778298ad0-3
00:24:23.749 --> 00:24:24.420
or red hair

a10d32ab-5bb6-4b56-8a60-bc108393d044-0
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.770
He's got his white milkman
uniform in his white hat.

c9dae5d0-bd86-45c6-b3e9-92068caeee7b-0
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.050
And his van is parked front of
that building.

61c70332-aba5-4048-bd22-19b58d454ccf-0
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.529
The the fellow with the broken
leg is being pushed down the

61c70332-aba5-4048-bd22-19b58d454ccf-1
00:24:38.529 --> 00:24:42.120
cobbled St and we're down by a
fat girl in a red.

72a86de8-7583-4914-817b-78558720187e-0
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.850
In a red dress.

7d3d6657-5550-4b6b-be9e-f12eac324953-0
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.523
2 3 3 boys talking about a
balloon. The dog there doggies

7d3d6657-5550-4b6b-be9e-f12eac324953-1
00:24:52.523 --> 00:24:56.110
wearing some sort of saddle
which is quite old.

53ae4e10-f850-4d7c-b975-2d7b79339142-0
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.250
there is a small

6553ba57-324a-42a7-89f8-a4687a686087-0
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.829
Girl with big big round
spectacles, talking to the man

6553ba57-324a-42a7-89f8-a4687a686087-1
00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:05.580
with the broken leg in the
wheelchair.

d3685607-f6e6-47bc-9603-da411825293f-0
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.770
The fellow with.

1bdcafdc-ebc4-40dd-9867-3504911e72bd-0
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:16.138
bald head and pull from Tufts of
hair over the ears and maybe

1bdcafdc-ebc4-40dd-9867-3504911e72bd-1
00:25:16.138 --> 00:25:21.167
like a a bakers apron blue shirt
underneath it. He's the just

1bdcafdc-ebc4-40dd-9867-3504911e72bd-2
00:25:21.167 --> 00:25:25.710
just gesturing with his arms,
not sure to what purpose.

6d2846a0-8885-43b4-8971-1304705e48a4-0
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.680
Seems to be steam coming out of
building, or maybe smoking. Now

6d2846a0-8885-43b4-8971-1304705e48a4-1
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.410
there's BBQ, there's a there's a
BBQ grill on the front lawn.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.863
Go to the next building over was
where the removal Van was

a01965b1-ee60-4058-9f5b-e16e0b7f829c-1
00:25:45.863 --> 00:25:48.430
pulling away from last episode.

d1c4e5f3-2b7c-4887-a7e8-e0450ed0af49-0
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:49.980
With the

dcab9abb-11d8-4a22-8354-8a9f003745fc-0
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.179
Old man with a small beard and
goatee and coming down the

dcab9abb-11d8-4a22-8354-8a9f003745fc-1
00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:54.470
steps.

9dd3e0c0-bc5a-4578-94b0-e091af2639b8-0
00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.155
Child that was either another
child of the blue and the yellow

9dd3e0c0-bc5a-4578-94b0-e091af2639b8-1
00:26:00.155 --> 00:26:00.440
top.

a89c18b3-e911-4ad8-82d5-e9e63e592ed4-0
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.940
It was the same one before.

c2bf61fb-67e5-4f47-9172-5b9fd225dc38-0
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.710
The artist is in his window, but
there's so.

d895cc6f-0407-4b2a-914c-36fe2ae54ad7-0
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.730
On the event down below.

15b121aa-1a09-438e-9b7e-4896d0ebb792-0
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.200
And these were perhaps selling
one of the artist paintings.

3c7da142-8fc0-45c7-89b8-4d5167ea9aeb-0
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.270
Red sports car.

9004fa01-df7d-4d40-b8d8-3e7ce3c1e166-0
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.790
With.

9ba86688-d010-4c7e-86dc-7a6700086df4-0
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.210
Two people inside.

361e43f2-3a23-47bc-ba38-d2f82914735b-0
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.630
He's coming in from the right
hand side of the screen.

ca02a869-a925-4ec4-a984-62ded0f79b01-0
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.153
Into the of the bridge over, I
think the river can't see

ca02a869-a925-4ec4-a984-62ded0f79b01-1
00:26:33.153 --> 00:26:36.140
whether there is any water in
the river yet.

e809cc02-7d30-41d3-91df-1c5babadbcee-0
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.180
The thing kept on.

15803f14-4b87-4282-9ea3-3b7dbfdb3961-0
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.713
You round the corner of the ice
cream salesman is still there.

15803f14-4b87-4282-9ea3-3b7dbfdb3961-1
00:26:44.713 --> 00:26:46.630
There are children close by to
him.

e344e46c-8642-47b0-9cfe-44627e7ba976-0
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.020
Uh.

205c8c63-ada6-4948-bd11-d7ef820b7d57-0
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.680
{Would you like me to on top of
the?}

878e446c-871b-4f07-87d7-a0160720c4f0-0
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.160
{They think you're good.}

5746dcee-2e90-4aa5-bc2e-39cc9c1d3a5e-0
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.905
{So. So what did you say? Oh no,
you're good. My thing cut out

5746dcee-2e90-4aa5-bc2e-39cc9c1d3a5e-1
00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:03.880
really quickly.}

0e1bc542-1a46-4b31-95fa-5fd602090e71-0
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.610
{No, I think, I think, yeah,
let's move on then, please.}

354cec98-51fe-4c48-87db-08c855f01c0b-0
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.420
{OK.}

5393eaa6-e052-4a02-b5d6-c969fe30cd38-0
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.823
Well, I think it's getting dark
blue skies disappearing, and

5393eaa6-e052-4a02-b5d6-c969fe30cd38-1
00:27:23.823 --> 00:27:28.157
there's more clouds. The clock
says 8:50. I've forgotten what

5393eaa6-e052-4a02-b5d6-c969fe30cd38-2
00:27:28.157 --> 00:27:32.630
it said last time. The milkman
still or his van is still parked

5393eaa6-e052-4a02-b5d6-c969fe30cd38-3
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.190
outside.

fd1267a9-5653-433a-bd52-3ad8fc2d2625-0
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.980
The street lights are coming on,
so.

070cd7f2-3635-4242-b0e9-7376f80ae163-0
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.260
Getting towards the evening.

03def1af-1a7b-4060-8068-482300e53a26-0
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.092
Fat lady is no longer in her
window again, nothing going on

03def1af-1a7b-4060-8068-482300e53a26-1
00:27:46.092 --> 00:27:49.970
in that room. The Greens over in
the next room is still empty.

a2ffdfce-d47d-4c3d-b2aa-5ab193b6c6ad-0
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.423
And then they tell us we have
the scientist with the now with

a2ffdfce-d47d-4c3d-b2aa-5ab193b6c6ad-1
00:27:55.423 --> 00:28:00.195
a window box, 2 small children,
he's showing them the telescope

a2ffdfce-d47d-4c3d-b2aa-5ab193b6c6ad-2
00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:04.967
and they're looking up into the
sky, even though it's not night

a2ffdfce-d47d-4c3d-b2aa-5ab193b6c6ad-3
00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:07.129
time, so it won't be in full.

cf73a66b-8158-458b-b6b9-44f561c3fcd9-0
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.270
Stars and planets.

caf8ff1c-1815-4e8d-80a9-dbd411284a44-0
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.500
The family with a hat and a
green coat and a.

9ef9fda7-e47a-4484-84cc-bc1e63533422-0
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.373
Some sort of bag. He's going off
scene there. Or maybe he's going

9ef9fda7-e47a-4484-84cc-bc1e63533422-1
00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:31.086
to cross the bridge over the the
ice cream man is still there, or

9ef9fda7-e47a-4484-84cc-bc1e63533422-2
00:28:31.086 --> 00:28:34.299
his or his his hand cart is, it
seems to be.

195e5625-b3e9-4902-9064-89a0c8029f9b-0
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.860
Opening is the inside. I think
it's an ice cream.

c12152a4-9dfc-4d01-993c-9a895dcda197-0
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.992
Maybe it's not ice cream. Look
to it like hot dog salesman.

c12152a4-9dfc-4d01-993c-9a895dcda197-1
00:28:43.992 --> 00:28:46.110
They used to sell ice creams on
them.

a3a967c8-037c-43bd-a715-209712da72f4-0
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.160
The barbecues being taken in
from from from the.

818fcf5c-a733-4dbb-8b57-98490c25cf3c-0
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.810
From that house, from lawn.

b28007fb-99d9-4d6b-8c54-556798c26433-0
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.567
No one seems to be in the
downstairs As you can see

b28007fb-99d9-4d6b-8c54-556798c26433-1
00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:58.900
through the windows upstairs,
there's some.

371759a1-af17-48e8-b2ba-ca849d45273f-0
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.490
Man and two children perhaps
there watching television.

1bcff39b-0caa-404a-bca9-b58e9fdb65cf-0
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.540
And then operating and on on the
roof of the next building.

e00fd06a-de22-43d6-bded-b4c8435d66bc-0
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.939
Dressed in a Roman toga he seems
to be. Maybe he's making a

e00fd06a-de22-43d6-bded-b4c8435d66bc-1
00:29:14.939 --> 00:29:18.290
proclamation. It could be an
opposite result.

1dea1afc-461e-4794-929e-d5aecb600f21-0
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.340
The artist is this.

d939bed9-c408-4418-a60c-29b81f4df6ae-0
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.860
There's no meeting.

1549c312-4315-487b-b04f-92f1c85a3306-0
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.300
The fellow on the sidewalk is no
longer.

45dea694-5c1c-42c0-8b4b-838a76170b82-0
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.285
Setting a any paintings the chap
in the wheelchair as lost

45dea694-5c1c-42c0-8b4b-838a76170b82-1
00:29:33.285 --> 00:29:38.650
pushing him and he's helping us
out. He's playing football of

45dea694-5c1c-42c0-8b4b-838a76170b82-2
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.668
course in his wheelchair and
there are 1 2 3 4 5 children

45dea694-5c1c-42c0-8b4b-838a76170b82-3
00:29:43.668 --> 00:29:45.140
playing with him.

41639b1b-aeb7-4cbc-b175-7ebd66e96a92-0
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.720
Two more children go. Children
are going towards him.

dcc45d06-7f4b-4c9d-ac82-ccc513d9777d-0
00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.763
The Nice green cells and with
with his with his ice cream hand

dcc45d06-7f4b-4c9d-ac82-ccc513d9777d-1
00:29:55.763 --> 00:29:59.811
car seems to be being pushed
away by one child. Another child

dcc45d06-7f4b-4c9d-ac82-ccc513d9777d-2
00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:04.120
is sitting on its shoulders that
maybe they're all the small dog,

dcc45d06-7f4b-4c9d-ac82-ccc513d9777d-3
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.450
all dog or sidewalk. They'd be
at union ice cream.

e7d9162c-0b13-42e4-b277-a6aed16f17c8-0
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.302
Most of the windows that are
unoccupied people have left the

e7d9162c-0b13-42e4-b277-a6aed16f17c8-1
00:30:15.302 --> 00:30:18.330
rooms coming. Maybe it's an
early evening stroll.

7faa78c1-0026-4c8e-ae18-4f88cb59f4f6-0
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.200
Didn't deny.

125fb632-04d0-49de-95cd-fdc47ed30ff0-0
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.972
I'm not sure that clock works
alas because I think it was

125fb632-04d0-49de-95cd-fdc47ed30ff0-1
00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:26.540
darker than an earlier time than
it is now, so.

92d82fba-1b73-427d-b909-45d1f551b6fc-0
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:32.312
Maybe in one picture they know
no ones at all, so I don't think

92d82fba-1b73-427d-b909-45d1f551b6fc-1
00:30:32.312 --> 00:30:35.200
we can rely on the clock very
much.

6b63cc42-1bbf-4bbd-ae84-32b3c454c4ec-0
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.497
Oh, couple walking down hand in
hand and down the sidewalk.

6b63cc42-1bbf-4bbd-ae84-32b3c454c4ec-1
00:30:40.497 --> 00:30:44.090
again its cobble The Walking
slowly back towards the fountain

17d478e1-e668-465b-b2fc-66dac4453eb6-0
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.620
{I.}

f681a922-7214-419c-9d48-16684beb836b-0
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.180
{That's about it.}

771f4705-20b7-4eaf-bae3-4c3a4131880f-0
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.060
{OK.}

59fcd40c-7508-4cb4-9fa7-13b92401f253-0
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.756
Presumably the same town or
village from a different angle.

59fcd40c-7508-4cb4-9fa7-13b92401f253-1
00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:10.530
We got the cafe there. The
little man is still.

02784dfb-dac2-4265-a0e2-fce2b827b33b-0
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.920
Oh no, it's little old man.

bdb265ed-750d-412f-abcf-24349fe6f7cd-0
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.090
Of a leaning.

5693fd8b-079e-4c28-8cdd-cc13ea23e4ce-0
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.900
Against the wall that enters to
the cafe.

d566e9e9-c5a4-4303-af5e-880a275129f3-0
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.240
Will do.

0e0a729a-8036-4969-b5d7-e89f42b430bf-0
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.740
Two people

7b3a1370-2b9b-4a49-ab85-3ab63972f739-0
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.641
Talking to a another third
person under the street light in

7b3a1370-2b9b-4a49-ab85-3ab63972f739-1
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:34.735
front of the cafe he might be on
a motorcycle is difficult to

7b3a1370-2b9b-4a49-ab85-3ab63972f739-2
00:31:34.735 --> 00:31:35.000
say.

47f26574-e2db-4f57-b309-a0a2b1ee0821-0
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.828
We got the rather splendid
statue again back on top of that

47f26574-e2db-4f57-b309-a0a2b1ee0821-1
00:31:39.828 --> 00:31:40.570
roof of the.

53f65227-3e04-4970-b285-201ccb5c0133-0
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.110
Cavalier type fellow war pirate?
That's on top of the walls.

0f6248b8-c782-461b-8ed8-f1a49304d79e-0
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.471
There's an upstairs balcony with
a small family, the father and

0f6248b8-c782-461b-8ed8-f1a49304d79e-1
00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:52.735
child looking quite pleased with
themselves. Not sure what

0f6248b8-c782-461b-8ed8-f1a49304d79e-2
00:31:52.735 --> 00:31:56.166
they're looking at, but they're
looking out from the rooftop.

0f6248b8-c782-461b-8ed8-f1a49304d79e-3
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:57.660
Actually, that's something.

30401eeb-bca3-43ec-9d12-cda36178216c-0
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.920
Is this your people are bags,
but then they're all going about

30401eeb-bca3-43ec-9d12-cda36178216c-1
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.018
their own business coming you're
going going home or coming out

30401eeb-bca3-43ec-9d12-cda36178216c-2
00:32:15.018 --> 00:32:15.890
from from another?

adc2e9f1-cc83-4d50-bafc-6e8653579a17-0
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.067
no Great deal of interaction
between any of them with each

adc2e9f1-cc83-4d50-bafc-6e8653579a17-1
00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:21.400
other.

02e786fa-4984-4b3b-9a0b-7190caf32dd4-0
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.280
Street lights are coming on.

e6c51f79-1fa9-4259-9289-c1e45281ada4-0
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.717
Don't know what the time is?
Don't see the clock? There's

e6c51f79-1fa9-4259-9289-c1e45281ada4-1
00:32:27.717 --> 00:32:29.140
still a bit of blue sky and
some.

cdd38c25-9623-44ed-942c-2200c6d6843b-0
00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:34.190
Strange pink color clouds. Maybe
it's sunset?

09002c17-edef-4d0f-b2d8-9157c206bb98-0
00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.700
So let's see what happens in the
next problem.

503391f2-73a3-4201-b025-dfdc7cfa20ab-0
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.545
OK, this is more of a from
ground level of by expect the

503391f2-73a3-4201-b025-dfdc7cfa20ab-1
00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:50.270
same St same we got the the
fountain there was a.

38d78146-834f-4d73-b5b3-30a3ecc722dc-0
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.701
Looks a little drunk, this.
Well, possibly he's gonna bolt

38d78146-834f-4d73-b5b3-30a3ecc722dc-1
00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:55.710
them on and he's.

2fbde73a-2e7c-4583-8190-be33b3a531b4-0
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.180
Leaning looking a bit bored with
a large beard and mustache.

576d02d7-b300-40b4-b5da-c9b3410a479a-0
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.542
Doesn't necessarily mean he's a
bad person, but he doesn't look

576d02d7-b300-40b4-b5da-c9b3410a479a-1
00:33:05.542 --> 00:33:07.750
too salubrious and the dog is
with him.

4c95d77f-df4c-4c3d-a9d6-f2342a4b78eb-0
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.470
No car but that side of building
in motor car.

1df41b67-9758-4292-8732-11e222b345da-0
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.460
Next to that there's a man
sitting in his window looking at

1df41b67-9758-4292-8732-11e222b345da-1
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.680
his shutters over and smoke
coming out of chimneys before

1df41b67-9758-4292-8732-11e222b345da-2
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.900
after a great deal of smoke with
some smoke clouds. Look.

90ffc209-89e6-4aef-a3e7-d84ec114b18b-0
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.630
Look to be pink or red so.

219a84a4-5043-465c-98cf-acb37da62bb8-0
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.910
maybe it is.

a7d81170-b523-489a-8ecd-d64089644d69-0
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.754
Sunset and the sun is shining
through the clouds. Or maybe

a7d81170-b523-489a-8ecd-d64089644d69-1
00:33:34.754 --> 00:33:35.520
something's.

1a9c1a44-d7fe-43e3-959c-eb87609f37a9-0
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.320
The old boy, he's.

d0e804df-dc27-4f85-abca-c376fa45ed65-0
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.860
Got a carpet bag and he stopped
to.

4ce22f00-6e6d-4f91-ba82-881efc51539f-0
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.442
I think that he's looking at the
sign that says for sales and

4ce22f00-6e6d-4f91-ba82-881efc51539f-1
00:33:49.442 --> 00:33:53.134
maybe he's going to move into
the property. We saw the people

4ce22f00-6e6d-4f91-ba82-881efc51539f-2
00:33:53.134 --> 00:33:54.980
being moved out of in the last.

f175f5fe-52b9-453a-8bab-1197afc54aef-0
00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:01.280
But another woman looking down
from the window at the old one

01ae3b1d-a175-4f9a-af86-12afcd498768-0
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.730
And below ground floor, there's
another fellow.

6ccf3cd4-db6b-4d18-9787-80f4d5ce9c27-0
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.872
Expect those bald head bowties
are smoking your pipe, looking

6ccf3cd4-db6b-4d18-9787-80f4d5ce9c27-1
00:34:10.872 --> 00:34:12.310
somewhat surprised 

b87bd4ee-efca-4d8f-9fbd-82ca9d11e9a4-0
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.820
Jack the mustache.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.355
And he's either struck a match
to illuminate something, or he

23acc855-7443-465c-8a58-3d4b89429b66-1
00:34:28.355 --> 00:34:30.860
has some of his hand he's
looking at.

larger picture. So we'll we'll
start off with the larger

00:37:40.793 --> 00:37:45.540

sailed across the bridge. Long,

presume it's a sidewalk. Lots of
people walking around. So in the

Under the aqueduct, is it really
is an act. It might be a bridge,

00:38:20.771 --> 00:38:25.509
but it's interesting product and
we have a number of large ships

5c276593-4954-4759-bcab-baf9cdee3d1f-2
00:38:25.509 --> 00:38:28.279
with with funnels that issuing
smoke.

fc87a95e-80a8-443a-b87a-e86637f2e871-0
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.660
Lots of people on the on the
sidewalk dog and a cat.

4c2b43a6-5e33-4c01-951a-d57224970b26-0
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.640
Man with a with a with a with a.

e7af0686-e89b-4ab7-821a-dc58389b037b-0
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.240
Long, Apron That his Workman.
And then to his knees.

9aa4090d-4776-4758-8e14-928500aba6d0-0
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.140
Maybe somebody selling
newspapers?

845ea601-418d-49cd-b160-c6398d308d7c-0
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.240
Some sort of.

b19255f5-91a4-4621-8099-9c328afff237-0
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:53.575
Smoke coming out of a chimney on
the on the other piece of

b19255f5-91a4-4621-8099-9c328afff237-1
00:38:53.575 --> 00:38:56.884
equipment on the on the
sidewalk. Maybe he's selling hot

b19255f5-91a4-4621-8099-9c328afff237-2
00:38:56.884 --> 00:38:58.220
chestnuts or some such.

2bcadc17-0ea4-4c8c-9a77-8652f2822078-0
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.374
If we look at the small
thumbnails now, we'll start with

2bcadc17-0ea4-4c8c-9a77-8652f2822078-1
00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:05.340
the top left and we got a man.

34af9180-8d96-4538-9103-6f76c4c600f0-0
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.173
Getting washed in the morning,
he seems to have soaked up in

34af9180-8d96-4538-9103-6f76c4c600f0-1
00:39:09.173 --> 00:39:10.670
washing in the back of his neck.

d632f270-c555-4ce6-bed5-2c73243f4dbb-0
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:16.110
And then he go with this thing
and he's locked up and he's he's

d632f270-c555-4ce6-bed5-2c73243f4dbb-1
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.760
he's trying to shave with a wet
rag. Now he's putting on his,

d632f270-c555-4ce6-bed5-2c73243f4dbb-2
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.060
his.

bd3f29be-1d4b-4d9d-bc4a-6769cfba672b-0
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.670
Waist coddles.

0f4a66e0-d4de-4f3a-9ad3-6b58607e5ae8-0
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.330
Next on these shy tying his
shoelaces, his right shoe.

943da0d5-4125-4f45-ba86-41f3b0a0b7d2-0
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:35.310
checking his money in his hand
and counting out to some coins.

da2a47cd-52d2-47a4-bc2c-87464391f393-0
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.510
That's grasping his hat.

9ee3d116-ca0e-4cd8-bbdc-225850c852f3-0
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.866
And then we see a map, one of
those folding maps that are

9ee3d116-ca0e-4cd8-bbdc-225850c852f3-1
00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:46.180
difficult to fold back up again
with the.

fbc72117-d0ab-4e9a-a15c-51475d6d78bc-0
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.833
The street layout show the town
layout showing the streets, and

fbc72117-d0ab-4e9a-a15c-51475d6d78bc-1
00:39:51.833 --> 00:39:55.100
he's looking to make sure he
knows where he's going.

f545400a-efb4-4137-9d08-c36d83fabf09-0
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.832
I think that's him standing on
the sidewalk with his hat on his

f545400a-efb4-4137-9d08-c36d83fabf09-1
00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:05.746
jacket and his coat rather
looking intensely at the map

f545400a-efb4-4137-9d08-c36d83fabf09-2
00:40:05.746 --> 00:40:09.590
with a peculiar creature at his
feet that accompanies.

f9537aca-baa1-4229-8de7-cabc73822d41-0
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.890
Looks like some sort of alien
aliens space creature

dacce1e6-9d40-49bb-9b3b-210c4a5a692e-0
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.877
 He's a space dog or some such.
Whatever the creature is, is

dacce1e6-9d40-49bb-9b3b-210c4a5a692e-1
00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:22.670
looking at the map, checking is.

71521e45-a276-4eb5-a972-b6604f91f5c1-0
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.151
And then the next he shows the
man he's deciding which way he

71521e45-a276-4eb5-a972-b6604f91f5c1-1
00:40:27.151 --> 00:40:28.050
shouldn't be going.

3de001ed-dc4c-404e-a25b-aa765faadc4c-0
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.630
And the creature is following
him, has a long tail and is

3de001ed-dc4c-404e-a25b-aa765faadc4c-1
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.930
white.

ccdd8a55-1f3f-4b19-babc-9feb7edef05b-0
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.428
And then the small thumbnail
show the industrial sort of

ccdd8a55-1f3f-4b19-babc-9feb7edef05b-1
00:40:40.428 --> 00:40:40.970
scene.

33bd47eb-dc5b-4577-8525-86a3be22fb94-0
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.353
A road where your railway
elevated above some Smokey

33bd47eb-dc5b-4577-8525-86a3be22fb94-1
00:40:47.353 --> 00:40:49.130
factory type buildings.

fbba062b-6036-42be-be88-b0f5dcf15f11-0
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.750
Curving round left, right.

08e32ac2-9ed1-4509-8e97-7d0cc7a94a4f-0
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:57.526
We may be very clear. It could
be a freeway with traffic on it.

08e32ac2-9ed1-4509-8e97-7d0cc7a94a4f-1
00:40:57.526 --> 00:41:01.310
It's very small dealings, is
that difficult to say?

cd0c9c6f-9764-479f-aa7e-deda6e5f80a4-0
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:08.975
The final three thumbnails show
the man peering at his at his

cd0c9c6f-9764-479f-aa7e-deda6e5f80a4-1
00:41:08.975 --> 00:41:10.140
street map.

9f1db8f4-f545-4320-b443-21b0a8cf89e1-0
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.810
Well, you've had.

1a3bd835-9a35-4810-a6ae-e20c933b3bd5-0
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.650
And.

587b30f1-b759-4368-86a2-c0177483d164-0
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.477
The language is only peculiar.
It's it's it's an odd language.

587b30f1-b759-4368-86a2-c0177483d164-1
00:41:18.477 --> 00:41:20.110
I don't know what it's saying.

85cb4eb8-8128-4263-a624-bfd5917e2b8e-0
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.900
But, and it's pretty egregious
still there.

9c03f917-2290-419a-bc81-96252f47820f-0
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.255
There's a long tail and a
peculiarly snake shaped head.

9c03f917-2290-419a-bc81-96252f47820f-1
00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:27.750
It's white.

71cb8fc4-3a02-4883-bbef-d44ebe0237a8-0
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.190
Looks like.

9bc4e159-5d47-4eab-a50d-cb5e45d93d2a-0
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:33.200
Giant dragon lizard, but it may
not be.

2df04292-c6c3-45e7-9684-efb3ceb358fe-0
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.740
Next.

949f1bb3-495d-43cb-a70c-b24cbad00f52-0
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:42.191
OK, same thing again. Lots of
thumbnails looking at the

949f1bb3-495d-43cb-a70c-b24cbad00f52-1
00:41:42.191 --> 00:41:45.210
particular details and one
slightly larger one.

aea19811-4602-4086-96fb-67dd3c74dda3-0
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:50.050
Which I'll do fast. May have a
group of people and you sort of

aea19811-4602-4086-96fb-67dd3c74dda3-1
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.680
sebia coloured. All of these are
sepia.

66f9a9e5-75a4-42d7-a90c-c51c6cd054cb-0
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:58.410
Britains and flying boats.

f62de48c-c2e0-40ee-9057-c9a52139385f-0
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:04.110
With funnels issuing smoke and
there's the sky is full of them.

a2439ac9-6467-4dad-9f4b-fedcd039f7d1-0
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.710
And there are people stopped
from the.

6aafae67-9500-48b0-a8b0-6c25496be014-0
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.175
In the town, all looking up at
these things. Some are wearing

6aafae67-9500-48b0-a8b0-6c25496be014-1
00:42:14.175 --> 00:42:17.720
hats. One of them is they
holding his bicycle.

e929e5da-a70e-49f9-8b17-64c194e9201e-0
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.930
All the sort of.

9a168a93-75fd-4730-a92c-083e84b9c5fc-0
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.728
Maybe late Victoria type people
wearing that sort of clothing or

9a168a93-75fd-4730-a92c-083e84b9c5fc-1
00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:26.960
wearing hats and.

55a9e38b-b867-49d5-a57b-949a697709ec-0
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.813
Don't seem concerned, appointing
happily jump peering at these

55a9e38b-b867-49d5-a57b-949a697709ec-1
00:42:33.813 --> 00:42:37.710
flying boats, but now seems to
be alarmed by just vaguely

55a9e38b-b867-49d5-a57b-949a697709ec-2
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:38.450
interested.

c8682af1-9262-47c0-a22b-d599bcae7ebb-0
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:46.134
There's there's quite a number,
2345678910 or at least 20 flying

c8682af1-9262-47c0-a22b-d599bcae7ebb-1
00:42:46.134 --> 00:42:47.700
over this town.

1f6bd3eb-9cba-401b-8b73-450861ea1357-0
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.260
Where do we go? Back to
thumbnails. Starting at the

1f6bd3eb-9cba-401b-8b73-450861ea1357-1
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.753
first one, we got those peculiar
pictures. There are two of them,

1f6bd3eb-9cba-401b-8b73-450861ea1357-2
00:42:56.753 --> 00:43:01.246
and I still don't know what they
are. What are the has, has, has?

1f6bd3eb-9cba-401b-8b73-450861ea1357-3
00:43:01.246 --> 00:43:05.331
He standing on four legs with
most of his body, seems to be

1f6bd3eb-9cba-401b-8b73-450861ea1357-4
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:09.280
hinged in the mouth, two ears,
and a great long tail that

1f6bd3eb-9cba-401b-8b73-450861ea1357-5
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.710
turned over his head.

98a08e4f-c922-4a9e-8212-63becec1f069-0
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.795
And he's talking to something.
standing on two legs with two

98a08e4f-c922-4a9e-8212-63becec1f069-1
00:43:15.795 --> 00:43:16.670
pointy ears.

fa3fa600-65bc-4128-99c3-2eaa0b065f5a-0
00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.790
Soul. Vaguely. Bird creature,
perhaps?

dcc4e0b5-c4e1-416a-8215-ae494ca2f834-0
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.760
The nearest thing I could think
of, he's he's a.

c170541e-afbe-4dde-bc74-0db890b23423-0
00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:31.085
Little reptile and that no one.
Some sort of bug. Bit like an

c170541e-afbe-4dde-bc74-0db890b23423-1
00:43:31.085 --> 00:43:32.210
owl with big ears.

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-0
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:38.319
Move the next one. They're still
standing beside organ. There's a

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-1
00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:42.460
man, the man with the map he's
looking at. He still had his map

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-2
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.406
and feels that he run to him,
but he's looking questioningly

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-3
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:50.094
at the girl next to him. Or I
don't think they know each

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-4
00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:54.169
other. She's reading a book and
he's looking into with the two

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-5
00:43:54.169 --> 00:43:57.922
readers between them. And I
think he's going to ask her a

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-6
00:43:57.922 --> 00:44:01.933
question next. Then he does.
He's asked the girl the question

a12eb787-6626-43a5-b113-00f5fd4750b9-7
00:44:01.933 --> 00:44:02.580
and she's.

ac3fdd60-5261-4666-bbec-4f2647a0a492-0
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.460
we have the 4th picture.

5b562d0f-d7c3-4e78-a102-2ce665c86c77-0
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.644
But they're both looking at the
map that he's holding out to her

5b562d0f-d7c3-4e78-a102-2ce665c86c77-1
00:44:10.644 --> 00:44:11.780
to help, and she's.

8229c41a-0681-4bbe-bf46-828c2188f683-0
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.770
Putting directions or pointing
at something on the map and.

d1ed6dd0-bb41-44b6-b942-41b5e7eeea2e-0
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.510
She has.

b3676b09-e1f5-4bf2-bed6-0115f18401f5-0
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.248
I don't know whether the subsidy
looks like he has another

b3676b09-e1f5-4bf2-bed6-0115f18401f5-1
00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:27.920
extension on her index finger.

89f38990-3ceb-49a7-98e9-e79c46790ee6-0
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.280
Anyway, so the next one we see
her looking at the camera.

165db784-33ed-4a3c-bc8a-34894fec6c11-0
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:38.462
And gesturing to all data robot,
I think it might not be a robot

165db784-33ed-4a3c-bc8a-34894fec6c11-1
00:44:38.462 --> 00:44:43.402
like that. The old fashioned
Rotary dial for it could be a

165db784-33ed-4a3c-bc8a-34894fec6c11-2
00:44:43.402 --> 00:44:44.240
telephone.

31650cef-b7d6-40c6-8691-f990d23d66de-0
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.850
Seems to have referees on the
dial. They got maybe an air.

94a0d667-7742-49af-b2b2-dfab3c135873-0
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.000
Well, it is telephone.

f5a5d0e0-8a17-4ef4-a889-f64e868fee22-0
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:57.768
And the next image shows her
dialing about them pulling a

f5a5d0e0-8a17-4ef4-a889-f64e868fee22-1
00:44:57.768 --> 00:45:02.464
leap and then out of the horn.
It isn't just speaking on

f5a5d0e0-8a17-4ef4-a889-f64e868fee22-2
00:45:02.464 --> 00:45:07.490
something falls into a hand,
maybe a ticket. She's so she's.

30542fad-f65a-42ad-991e-0d67026a6c1b-0
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.133
And again, there's a variety.
There's Everclear foreign

30542fad-f65a-42ad-991e-0d67026a6c1b-1
00:45:11.133 --> 00:45:12.260
language. I don't know.

9cd8f50a-622e-42e2-bca5-55824b8dc3b5-0
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.230
As usual, she dialed the numbers
for the handle.

cee22499-5ddd-441b-afcb-fc0884339c45-0
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:21.068
It is a ticket if it's a patient
and she's pointing at it and

cee22499-5ddd-441b-afcb-fc0884339c45-1
00:45:21.068 --> 00:45:25.273
she's given it to the man with
the hat and and the map and now

cee22499-5ddd-441b-afcb-fc0884339c45-2
00:45:25.273 --> 00:45:28.210
perhaps she's explaining to him
what it is.

ec441a71-add4-4d11-abbe-cb44f275c492-0
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.645
He's he's he's peering and
looking interested at what what

ec441a71-add4-4d11-abbe-cb44f275c492-1
00:45:32.645 --> 00:45:33.690
you're giving him.

65abfbcc-ffb8-48d2-8c41-1a481ff7de73-0
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.931
So there we go to the next page
and underneath the thing that

65abfbcc-ffb8-48d2-8c41-1a481ff7de73-1
00:45:37.931 --> 00:45:40.540
the larger picture of 1. No,
we're looking at the.

943ac8df-dc39-4649-8818-f7d78a69119f-0
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.070
Looking at the the flying boats.
{Sorry about that. The.}

dc99eb2b-3eff-45fa-81a3-ebde13924f05-0
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:54.130
Thumbnails underneath. And then
we were seeing a closer, more

dc99eb2b-3eff-45fa-81a3-ebde13924f05-1
00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:58.457
closer look at the people
looking at these strange

dc99eb2b-3eff-45fa-81a3-ebde13924f05-2
00:45:58.457 --> 00:46:03.463
machines and what looks maybe
like a paddle steamer. We're

dc99eb2b-3eff-45fa-81a3-ebde13924f05-3
00:46:03.463 --> 00:46:05.670
great tall moogie jimmies.

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-0
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:11.819
The man is a boarding this this
this this this this boat it

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-1
00:46:11.819 --> 00:46:16.129
could be a paddle steamer boat
perhaps that flies and we see

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-2
00:46:16.129 --> 00:46:20.086
the man and the girl of the
creature with the long tail

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-3
00:46:20.086 --> 00:46:24.325
walking in procession with other
people and that someone is

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-4
00:46:24.325 --> 00:46:28.847
clipping his is taking some of
the boarding this this this this

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-5
00:46:28.847 --> 00:46:32.875
boat. I think I'm wearing
sunglasses with a pointy beard

b6800253-eb30-4718-9c67-3f16eae5c604-6
00:46:32.875 --> 00:46:36.620
some sort of uniform. We're
wearing a hat he's like.

986c2824-12d2-4d87-bcba-fe8e4b4d89cc-0
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.974
Directing, gesturing the men to
follow the the line of

986c2824-12d2-4d87-bcba-fe8e4b4d89cc-1
00:46:40.974 --> 00:46:45.824
passengers towards the going to
embark on the boat on a on the

986c2824-12d2-4d87-bcba-fe8e4b4d89cc-2
00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:46.440
journey.

6a925105-de9b-486a-b083-02270d87ffc3-0
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.370
{Next please.}

13e8894c-822d-4b08-93c3-fa9c0038c65b-0
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.220
OK, so we have two pages. You'll
see your colored, we've got the

13e8894c-822d-4b08-93c3-fa9c0038c65b-1
00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.412
little thumbnail images of
particular bits of the scene,

13e8894c-822d-4b08-93c3-fa9c0038c65b-2
00:47:01.412 --> 00:47:05.825
and we start over. The man
taking and the peculiar creature

13e8894c-822d-4b08-93c3-fa9c0038c65b-3
00:47:05.825 --> 00:47:07.370
is sitting alongside.

a130dfd3-cca5-4596-a537-220dc05dab7e-0
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.151
That guy is is difficult to
describe. The creature has a

a130dfd3-cca5-4596-a537-220dc05dab7e-1
00:47:13.151 --> 00:47:17.200
long tail, it's white. It's got
eyes on the side of his head and

a130dfd3-cca5-4596-a537-220dc05dab7e-2
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.938
small ears on the top of his
head. Most of his body does in

a130dfd3-cca5-4596-a537-220dc05dab7e-3
00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:24.925
fact appear just to be head, and
it's hinged way back under the

a130dfd3-cca5-4596-a537-220dc05dab7e-4
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:28.912
other, so he can open his mouth
very wide. We haven't seen that

a130dfd3-cca5-4596-a537-220dc05dab7e-5
00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:30.470
yet, but I think he will.

6acc426f-8c9d-482b-8846-4c80022ce5e2-0
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.580
Then sitting in it.

db745c4f-a8b7-479c-8314-185f865f92e3-0
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.622
Open air seating on what I'm
doing is going to be the boat to

db745c4f-a8b7-479c-8314-185f865f92e3-1
00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:42.709
flying boat and he's talking to,
well, sitting next to him who

db745c4f-a8b7-479c-8314-185f865f92e3-2
00:47:42.709 --> 00:47:46.602
has the other Vaculik, which
might or might not be a a bird

db745c4f-a8b7-479c-8314-185f865f92e3-3
00:47:46.602 --> 00:47:50.689
with long pointy ears like and
shaped ears on top of his head.

b44653c6-5782-4c50-b151-3307c5a63cb2-0
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.645
And the girl appeared to be
explaining matters to the man.

b44653c6-5782-4c50-b151-3307c5a63cb2-1
00:47:55.645 --> 00:47:59.850
There are other people sitting
in benches and deck chairs,

b44653c6-5782-4c50-b151-3307c5a63cb2-2
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.489
woman carrying a child.

a731d446-5d9d-4b31-9bcf-78b0c9c7bb97-0
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.100
It's a commuter.

44a2e6ef-9269-4333-acb3-b635afc9f549-0
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.400
Transport perhaps? Or maybe the
emigrating to foreign land?

84cd21e5-3633-497c-8277-cb0bee7886d4-0
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.961
The man with the hat and the
peculiar features talking to the

84cd21e5-3633-497c-8277-cb0bee7886d4-1
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:17.060
girl with the other peculiar
creature. They're having a

84cd21e5-3633-497c-8277-cb0bee7886d4-2
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.104
conversation about something or
other. He's explaining

84cd21e5-3633-497c-8277-cb0bee7886d4-3
00:48:20.104 --> 00:48:23.203
something, reaching in his
pocket, and he's showing the

84cd21e5-3633-497c-8277-cb0bee7886d4-4
00:48:23.203 --> 00:48:23.480
girl.

6257d401-b595-4ab6-8325-445e0b5ec910-0
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:31.236
Piece of paid a piece of paper
with a photograph on it and then

6257d401-b595-4ab6-8325-445e0b5ec910-1
00:48:31.236 --> 00:48:34.080
and rising video describing this
girl.

539d2815-3586-4972-b7f8-312f30b58705-0
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:35.390
The.

9377c10e-04a8-43a7-b3a2-076fbd06d1a7-0
00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:41.544
In the picture on the page looks
right, remarkably similar to the

9377c10e-04a8-43a7-b3a2-076fbd06d1a7-1
00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:46.530
girl that he's showing it to,
and she now reaches into her.

418813f9-fd0a-4463-a8f4-cd686ba9cbbc-0
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.020
Bag.

39adfb99-c6ee-4ea1-b358-44444c7da10a-0
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:53.940
And pulls out another.

ebff6684-6c9a-4c1a-ac09-1c09dc4a9fb8-0
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.488
Huge, big. I think their
passports, they seem to have

ebff6684-6c9a-4c1a-ac09-1c09dc4a9fb8-1
00:48:58.488 --> 00:49:02.213
stamps on. So you maybe they're
boarding tickets with, with,

ebff6684-6c9a-4c1a-ac09-1c09dc4a9fb8-2
00:49:02.213 --> 00:49:05.267
with, with, with. The
photographs on look vaguely

ebff6684-6c9a-4c1a-ac09-1c09dc4a9fb8-3
00:49:05.267 --> 00:49:07.100
oriental with the photographs.

fa1140bc-8893-41cc-849a-fcfc5a236778-0
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.150
And so they each have one, so
they've each got a battle with

fa1140bc-8893-41cc-849a-fcfc5a236778-1
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.964
them or they've each got a a
boarding. I think they're

fa1140bc-8893-41cc-849a-fcfc5a236778-2
00:49:15.964 --> 00:49:19.570
probably part of the pictures
and they got stamped.

705a191b-8a86-4dc6-afeb-683bf02de4f0-0
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.160
All over the page.

e07e7f08-b883-46f7-a8bf-5801ca701481-0
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.320
But then we move on to the next
on on the screen.

727d7f09-01f6-475c-bd95-87ef9b43a07a-0
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.010
We seem to have.

ac2ad78d-3a45-489e-ad6a-3dabf2d74993-0
00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.652
Maybe she's biting, maybe the
guy who's been missing, or she's

ac2ad78d-3a45-489e-ad6a-3dabf2d74993-1
00:49:33.652 --> 00:49:34.170
telling me.

59c1b5fe-28ae-4fe9-b01d-68029041c331-0
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.333
Man with the strange Greek who's
just telling her tale. I think

59c1b5fe-28ae-4fe9-b01d-68029041c331-1
00:49:39.333 --> 00:49:43.508
she's a prisoner and she's
reading a book. Man is coming in

59c1b5fe-28ae-4fe9-b01d-68029041c331-2
00:49:43.508 --> 00:49:48.101
and taking book from her roughly
and putting it in her drawer and

59c1b5fe-28ae-4fe9-b01d-68029041c331-3
00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:52.067
closing it and lock the drawer
clothes with a with a big

59c1b5fe-28ae-4fe9-b01d-68029041c331-4
00:49:52.067 --> 00:49:56.659
padlock and he's giving the girl
child they shovel dating her off

59c1b5fe-28ae-4fe9-b01d-68029041c331-5
00:49:56.659 --> 00:50:00.000
to go and do some work and she
likes the scene.

f1692358-320f-4d57-a55e-549aa00148a6-0
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.010
Sticking of.

a6dff8a4-335a-4c66-91b3-0f46f09c936f-0
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:11.195
Fire above my life, feeding the
the boiler of of of a steam

a6dff8a4-335a-4c66-91b3-0f46f09c936f-1
00:50:11.195 --> 00:50:11.930
engine.

f15f96eb-ffdd-4924-a692-0b2fe8ce9dce-0
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:15.500
They're feeding into this bright
glowing.

03319bb1-11e4-4181-b09c-7d2f43a89b20-0
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.062
Space in the middle of this
firebox, smoke coming out,

03319bb1-11e4-4181-b09c-7d2f43a89b20-1
00:50:20.062 --> 00:50:23.260
getting in their eyes. She's
carrying away from it.

aefe54f8-6fc0-4346-9fef-952fdcc1926e-0
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:28.903
Obviously two smoking. So she's
climbing up the ladder to the

aefe54f8-6fc0-4346-9fef-952fdcc1926e-1
00:50:28.903 --> 00:50:33.424
top of chimney and she's
cleaning cleaning the chimney by

aefe54f8-6fc0-4346-9fef-952fdcc1926e-2
00:50:33.424 --> 00:50:37.789
forcing a chimney sweeps brush
on a long nose as she's.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.240
Sorting out the smoke problem.

8657cab6-fc43-45d4-87ab-33c6ab31ea73-0
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:41.300
{That's it.}

06b6f65c-3814-4dd1-9a18-ec49218b4dcc-0
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.870


902eafbf-a682-4baf-8832-0e4b027ba0a7-0
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.420
{And now we have.}

d2fe5066-2c56-407f-ae96-d134f1a963ab-0
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.810
{OK, what do we have?}

ae8b7a2c-e05d-43ba-b4f2-64b7e0da38e7-0
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:04.389
Again, this is a very, very dark
sea burl fashioned depiction of

ae8b7a2c-e05d-43ba-b4f2-64b7e0da38e7-1
00:51:04.389 --> 00:51:10.007
what's going on. On the left
half images is is just one image

ae8b7a2c-e05d-43ba-b4f2-64b7e0da38e7-2
00:51:10.007 --> 00:51:15.263
and we see the girl atop the
cleaning the chimney and the

ae8b7a2c-e05d-43ba-b4f2-64b7e0da38e7-3
00:51:15.263 --> 00:51:19.160
looking down on her doing that
we can see.

4bca80e7-9f21-4771-b9c5-89925124d31f-0
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:27.894
Schools of small cube, all
lagging inclosures, each with a

4bca80e7-9f21-4771-b9c5-89925124d31f-1
00:51:27.894 --> 00:51:31.710
small girl feeding the fire box
of.

ba9d636b-dd8a-4347-ae27-de33dc4c1403-0
00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:35.250
An engine of some description.
They are all these.

cafb9d77-fc6b-4d6d-828f-073e2f687dc8-0
00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:40.982
5 boxes of chimneys are all
emitting smoke and they all seem

cafb9d77-fc6b-4d6d-828f-073e2f687dc8-1
00:51:40.982 --> 00:51:45.180
to be feeding into the central
points that are powering.

8fd31cef-7519-4014-b175-6ee3d92f9d34-0
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:47.480
Powering something.

bda26b3a-bcf5-4826-ae6a-e9791358cf4a-0
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:54.272
The girl is not happy at this.
She would dare say have back in

bda26b3a-bcf5-4826-ae6a-e9791358cf4a-1
00:51:54.272 --> 00:51:59.274
the in her cell which is, which
has a shovel so you can burst

bda26b3a-bcf5-4826-ae6a-e9791358cf4a-2
00:51:59.274 --> 00:52:04.114
lock on the door and she's
escaping and she before she goes

bda26b3a-bcf5-4826-ae6a-e9791358cf4a-3
00:52:04.114 --> 00:52:09.358
she's getting her book back out
of the drawer. She's broken into

bda26b3a-bcf5-4826-ae6a-e9791358cf4a-4
00:52:09.358 --> 00:52:14.198
that, running away now with her
book cluster tightly to her

bda26b3a-bcf5-4826-ae6a-e9791358cf4a-5
00:52:14.198 --> 00:52:19.120
chest going down the stairs
path, whole series of buildings.

dad8ea41-0920-4cc0-a487-cf4ec69703e4-0
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.154
Really believe? Picture it. It's
a it's a railway line, railway

dad8ea41-0920-4cc0-a487-cf4ec69703e4-1
00:52:24.154 --> 00:52:28.240
station, and she's climbing
aboard of a railway car.

2d15180d-3592-4553-abfa-ed609c509687-0
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.329
Sitting all huddled. And no,
you're holding her arms around

2d15180d-3592-4553-abfa-ed609c509687-1
00:52:33.329 --> 00:52:37.308
her shoulders and give herself
warm with her book. And then we

2d15180d-3592-4553-abfa-ed609c509687-2
00:52:37.308 --> 00:52:39.330
see the train all sort of train.

af1da0a3-5944-4f66-9487-5e4bd84f5eb8-0
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:46.298
Steam engine train with a lot of
great number of bridges behind.

af1da0a3-5944-4f66-9487-5e4bd84f5eb8-1
00:52:46.298 --> 00:52:51.027
I think it's a goods train. They
don't seem to be for people and

af1da0a3-5944-4f66-9487-5e4bd84f5eb8-2
00:52:51.027 --> 00:52:55.465
she's sitting in them in the
doorway of an open open doorway

af1da0a3-5944-4f66-9487-5e4bd84f5eb8-3
00:52:55.465 --> 00:52:59.976
of an empty goods wagon being
pulled by this train and in the

af1da0a3-5944-4f66-9487-5e4bd84f5eb8-4
00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:01.649
background you see the.

464dc766-699f-4559-abd6-e2a85b834d00-0
00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:06.615
The Dark satanic Smokey
chimmnies of the town, leaving

464dc766-699f-4559-abd6-e2a85b834d00-1
00:53:06.615 --> 00:53:09.950
behind as she as she escapes in
the train.

9359e20e-31e5-4687-8eca-b4711cfe6aa5-0
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.180
{Next please.}

5bc0a8af-cc37-45e3-befa-9344cd8feb5f-0
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.114
So ohh my lots going on this
one. So we're back now we see a

5bc0a8af-cc37-45e3-befa-9344cd8feb5f-1
00:53:21.114 --> 00:53:25.797
picture of the back, one of the
flying boats that we saw earlier

5bc0a8af-cc37-45e3-befa-9344cd8feb5f-2
00:53:25.797 --> 00:53:27.310
with smoke coming out

e9566c52-c33a-488f-af77-6007acc26f37-0
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:35.842
Absolute pandemic idea in the
back. Big circle of things and

e9566c52-c33a-488f-af77-6007acc26f37-1
00:53:35.842 --> 00:53:40.910
rows of people sitting in the
body of the boat as it flies.

1616edb4-21a1-4578-9fe5-ac7706f44b0f-0
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:47.205
Passed a great giant billboard
showing someone drinking a cup

1616edb4-21a1-4578-9fe5-ac7706f44b0f-1
00:53:47.205 --> 00:53:49.070
of coffee to be like.

c2b73728-0692-4dc2-a368-731fdd116595-0
00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:55.440
North Korea using all the
Blessed King Jong Un 

d4057a3d-59d3-4ec7-85bf-0616b56e27f0-0
00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.080
Posters on the buildings.

095d5103-df41-4296-96dc-8da3cc6d9daa-0
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:02.698
Funny foreign language and it's
saying we're looking down. The

095d5103-df41-4296-96dc-8da3cc6d9daa-1
00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:06.556
city was seeing the flying boat
and below that you can see all

095d5103-df41-4296-96dc-8da3cc6d9daa-2
00:54:06.556 --> 00:54:10.414
the traffic and pedestrians down
below as. They go about their

095d5103-df41-4296-96dc-8da3cc6d9daa-3
00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:11.700
business, we see the.

22837356-6797-41c7-9356-d262d875eee3-0
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.365
Boy and the girl she's got the
peculiar creature with the

22837356-6797-41c7-9356-d262d875eee3-1
00:54:16.365 --> 00:54:20.586
pointy count it is she seeks to
the man with the hat is French

22837356-6797-41c7-9356-d262d875eee3-2
00:54:20.586 --> 00:54:24.405
creature, and the girl was
pointing out five interest as

22837356-6797-41c7-9356-d262d875eee3-3
00:54:24.405 --> 00:54:28.760
they fly by. There's a gentlemen
with a hat and a uniform with a

22837356-6797-41c7-9356-d262d875eee3-4
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.512
with a megaphone shouting
something at them. Maybe it's

22837356-6797-41c7-9356-d262d875eee3-5
00:54:32.512 --> 00:54:36.130
time to disembark, and we now
see the ship as indeed.

de629f4c-b417-445a-a70b-71edcb9e25a5-0
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.529
Tied at the dock and people are
waiting for it to arrive.

de629f4c-b417-445a-a70b-71edcb9e25a5-1
00:54:40.529 --> 00:54:42.780
Waiting to greet, just coming
off.

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-0
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:47.776
A man with the hatches, shaking
hands with the girl with the

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-1
00:54:47.776 --> 00:54:51.656
peculiar creature with the
pointy ears, and he's taking

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-2
00:54:51.656 --> 00:54:55.813
leave of her, and we see him
walking down the sidewalk with

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-3
00:54:55.813 --> 00:55:00.316
his peculiar creature. And then
he stands and ponders, scratches

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-4
00:55:00.316 --> 00:55:04.750
his chin up. What's he going to
do next? He wonders, and we see

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-5
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:09.115
him looking out at being that
he's pondering upon, and there's

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-6
00:55:09.115 --> 00:55:13.272
a giant mythical creature like
the one has walking with him

f7344a16-0c98-4e26-a3a3-2c5c47ab3c54-7
00:55:13.272 --> 00:55:13.550
but.

1dca5efc-56b6-4a4e-af48-65bdfcfd4e91-0
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.290
This thing is enormous and is it
looking the?

9c387bc1-a409-453e-917f-226c9215bbf7-0
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:22.802
 the city and there are three or
four other people walking. He's

9c387bc1-a409-453e-917f-226c9215bbf7-1
00:55:22.802 --> 00:55:25.650
walking down a stoned staircase.

8deb623f-495d-4060-8e68-1d918f51d5d0-0
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.710
towards a.

739f7215-9a56-41dd-bfb8-8d261a8d5dc6-0
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:32.000
The town square that had an
enormous.

8ecc4ea6-2832-4f0e-b815-caf078794662-0
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:37.110
The statue of the the mythical
beast will long tail.

4ffbc5bf-7f73-4292-b4aa-c2c0611b06fc-0
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:39.890
{Next please.}

6ad7f2b8-8ad8-4a98-8cea-489022b78455-0
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.288
OK, so he carries on walking on
on the side where we can see the

6ad7f2b8-8ad8-4a98-8cea-489022b78455-1
00:55:48.288 --> 00:55:52.154
walls covered in posters
advertising something totally

6ad7f2b8-8ad8-4a98-8cea-489022b78455-2
00:55:52.154 --> 00:55:53.489
covered in posters.

8099fd74-b2e2-491d-b9aa-92af267bad61-0
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:58.957
We pull out from that scene and
there's 11234 buildings, all

8099fd74-b2e2-491d-b9aa-92af267bad61-1
00:55:58.957 --> 00:56:02.860
covered in posters, advertising
or somewhat political.

1f5ca30c-1dcc-436c-a34c-7678086966d4-0
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.640
Direct, perhaps, and lots of
people walking to and from

1f5ca30c-1dcc-436c-a34c-7678086966d4-1
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.900
business just the normal.

fd0d2ba3-daff-450f-bb04-8432fbae76af-0
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.760
They know whatever town there's.

ba1f2c23-74e7-49f1-829d-810c29d9727e-0
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:20.237
The two people, maybe they're
fishermen, have baskets of

ba1f2c23-74e7-49f1-829d-810c29d9727e-1
00:56:20.237 --> 00:56:24.423
something peculiar, like octopus
tentacles you can see sticking

ba1f2c23-74e7-49f1-829d-810c29d9727e-2
00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:25.470
out of the bags.

034f43a4-7463-4188-9ca1-1ee5fc4a8cef-0
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:30.329
And then a girl with a with a
woolly hat and a woolly scarf

034f43a4-7463-4188-9ca1-1ee5fc4a8cef-1
00:56:30.329 --> 00:56:30.530
is.

c4505c2e-cf44-4890-a96a-18da28c134f1-0
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.719
Buying something from a hole in
the wall that she's putting her

c4505c2e-cf44-4890-a96a-18da28c134f1-1
00:56:35.719 --> 00:56:40.380
head in and someone's passing or
something after this little flap

c4505c2e-cf44-4890-a96a-18da28c134f1-2
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.510
that comes down.

16fbdb32-8b5c-4a3e-b63b-9225165d1f2b-0
00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.453
And they're older couple. He's
got a French barrette and

16fbdb32-8b5c-4a3e-b63b-9225165d1f2b-1
00:56:45.453 --> 00:56:46.070
spectacles.

9c239b74-a01a-41b9-9d7f-8a9b18e67a42-0
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:50.728
She's wearing a headscarf,
carrying her box with a arrow.

9c239b74-a01a-41b9-9d7f-8a9b18e67a42-1
00:56:50.728 --> 00:56:54.678
Saying this way, but in the box
is one of those peculiar

9c239b74-a01a-41b9-9d7f-8a9b18e67a42-2
00:56:54.678 --> 00:56:58.420
creatures again, but similar to
the man with the hat.

02d1f769-8a67-4718-b116-b959b6f3fb89-0
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.620
We go back to this scene and the
man with that now has a book and

02d1f769-8a67-4718-b116-b959b6f3fb89-1
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:11.664
he's looking at is the following
instruction. I think it may be

02d1f769-8a67-4718-b116-b959b6f3fb89-2
00:57:11.664 --> 00:57:12.610
it's like a.

7c7b786e-1491-42a6-b1db-24639f169320-0

00:58:42.167 --> 00:58:46.803
Children think they're trying to
spell the member of the hat. One

c6aa3974-965f-4405-9e9d-f92aca9df1d5-5
00:58:46.803 --> 00:58:51.228

And and then he's pointing at
his and his empty palm, saying,

f7f84f30-2a85-4fac-9aea-9f789851ec10-1
00:58:59.357 --> 00:59:03.484

1bb71a93-b60f-492f-937c-7fb50a82c6b4-1
00:59:29.436 --> 00:59:32.991
basket tucked under his arm and

OK, so the member, the tables
and the suspenders is holding in

fdb3dd63-c0fa-431b-9e98-c2a04436ccd3-1
00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:59.290

demonstrating.

840e5b16-b6ac-4183-85c4-2838a20580bc-0
00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:06.370

Snake wrapped around his neck

01:03:18.167 --> 01:03:22.415
shaking. This thing everyone's
very about it. The boys choosing

90b9039c-713c-4a0d-9a8e-956e5de92d56-3
01:03:22.415 --> 01:03:26.796
proudly to the man with the hat,
the boy's father and his playing

90b9039c-713c-4a0d-9a8e-956e5de92d56-4
01:03:26.796 --> 01:03:30.911
with the with the new creature.
We learn as many friends with

90b9039c-713c-4a0d-9a8e-956e5de92d56-5
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:34.893
the strange creature that the
man with that hat and they're

90b9039c-713c-4a0d-9a8e-956e5de92d56-6
01:03:34.893 --> 01:03:39.009
now playing with themselves,
while the the boy child remember

90b9039c-713c-4a0d-9a8e-956e5de92d56-7
01:03:39.009 --> 01:03:39.540
the hat.

faa4ab8b-8695-4ff6-a4c1-3842e3b883ab-0
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:42.530
Pick up all the food stuffs that
they dropped on the ground.

e0606c7a-bb5c-41b7-8cc2-d391614268cb-0
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:46.260
That the boys father is
explaining matters to the man

e0606c7a-bb5c-41b7-8cc2-d391614268cb-1
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.685
with the hat and padding on the
shoulder and sending him on his

e0606c7a-bb5c-41b7-8cc2-d391614268cb-2
01:03:49.685 --> 01:03:49.900
way.

cbb9286e-6152-48dc-8ba8-cb1a5e8082c3-0
01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.039
The man is saying who? I don't
know. Whatever the guy what we

cbb9286e-6152-48dc-8ba8-cb1a5e8082c3-1
01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:56.600
write it down in this book. So
he has a notepad.

f24e0b0c-5a9c-40c9-91a9-88ebad9bdb9f-0
01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.740
And I think the man is telling
him directions of where to go.

35d7fd23-11cb-41ad-a07d-6b09a62c18bd-0
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.338
The man and the man with the
hat. The father, the John, the

35d7fd23-11cb-41ad-a07d-6b09a62c18bd-1
01:04:07.338 --> 01:04:08.370
member of the hat.

735cc332-bd90-429e-9158-af5605e90047-0
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:13.796
Are having a conversation
describing whatever the man has

735cc332-bd90-429e-9158-af5605e90047-1
01:04:13.796 --> 01:04:18.827
written into the notebook and
the man with the the boys child

735cc332-bd90-429e-9158-af5605e90047-2
01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:24.021
the boy's father sees was asking
me how I'm I can't go on here.

735cc332-bd90-429e-9158-af5605e90047-3
01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:28.971
And then we have a close up of
his eyes. Yeah the eyes. Very

735cc332-bd90-429e-9158-af5605e90047-4
01:04:28.971 --> 01:04:30.270
odd looks to be.

f361b4c6-0a10-454a-8f7a-093544cc0237-0
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.500
Hopefully teams in it somehow.

081d8b58-214c-4745-b6eb-2cfcc1e98452-0
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:37.526
#END_arrival-4 With the scary
way, but we think it'll be

081d8b58-214c-4745-b6eb-2cfcc1e98452-1
01:04:37.526 --> 01:04:39.060
explained on the next page.

b722631d-b279-49b8-b546-7c3bea2a2ea0-0
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.020
{Ohh.}

2246d677-1817-45f0-b8fd-57d204f56715-0
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:45.360
{So that's the end of that one.}

b43581fb-b452-4123-88ef-28a2bb5a3c29-0
01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:47.810
{Well, what happened next?}

071e2d52-c67e-4e08-94ad-02c375fb5a46-0
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.840
{I know this is not getting
you.}

214f52ce-6017-47d2-8055-2656194dbeee-0
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.100
{Getting interested?}

be0c8eb5-5b51-426c-a4bd-392a1a1f49b3-0
01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.550
{OK, we have 8 hours.}

5630ab2a-c01c-4594-b371-45ad9272ea2e-0
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.560
{Now we have this one. I'm gonna
pull it up now.}

7fd9b27b-4de3-4194-833a-aeff6a8adf1c-0
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:13.260
{OK, this one is 2 slides. It's
also a story.}

6889a152-0575-43c5-8816-a31ab96b7622-0
01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:15.810
{And.}

a10cec64-fd02-4fbf-822e-8551abb24cae-0
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.430
{Like before, just tell me when
to click but like.}

2270b52d-d5a3-41ca-81ce-2a6d76823e40-0
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:31.740
{OK.}

03c998fa-ff31-4448-b5c0-dda1d03bfb1b-0
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:36.460
{All right. Well, it's a.}

4e7f1203-d2d9-4f4d-abb4-563760bb9f71-0
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:42.826
#START_arrival-3 We have 8 very
little thumbnails of a street

4e7f1203-d2d9-4f4d-abb4-563760bb9f71-1
01:05:42.826 --> 01:05:46.714
scene and presumably the member
of the hat has arrived at

4e7f1203-d2d9-4f4d-abb4-563760bb9f71-2
01:05:46.714 --> 01:05:48.390
wherever he was going to.

58a722e0-33ff-4585-b4fd-ccc18de31e5a-0
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.890


e8ee46fe-9d27-4fcb-bc61-09c3a8ddff82-0
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:56.060
And is looking around to see
what his work what what does he

e8ee46fe-9d27-4fcb-bc61-09c3a8ddff82-1
01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:59.701
come do? Was he, what is he
arrived at and we see a scene

e8ee46fe-9d27-4fcb-bc61-09c3a8ddff82-2
01:05:59.701 --> 01:05:59.890
or.

95f951ca-78ce-49bb-8f2b-64d4401ad8c3-0
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.510
Again, this savior colored
images.

414a0364-2db8-4356-9fbe-0cc811d54f88-0
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.671
Like a Victorian or Victorian
travel book, perhaps? That's

414a0364-2db8-4356-9fbe-0cc811d54f88-1
01:06:11.671 --> 01:06:15.910
eagerly Egyptian in some
respects. Peculiar hats.

7c0fcae9-0672-4d63-afdd-81a11370d566-0
01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.788
All writing there's a there's a
newspaper seller or boy selling

7c0fcae9-0672-4d63-afdd-81a11370d566-1
01:06:19.788 --> 01:06:20.340
newspapers.

9356e8f9-41d6-4c00-a8e6-98af61e32cd1-0
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.770
He has a tucked under his arm
and his holding up.

5a226dc2-17e8-4d7a-872e-3cb816372dc4-0
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.230
Front page headline.

b1cf4967-3a3f-40a0-ac86-c3dbd2af84d2-0
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:33.291
People that building around
them, the type or one of them

b1cf4967-3a3f-40a0-ac86-c3dbd2af84d2-1
01:06:33.291 --> 01:06:36.120
was bought and newspaper from
the child and is reading it.

c174157b-e05d-40f1-94c6-67fed0fc5fb6-0
01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.100
Then we see a couple of people
one holding up

e6cfb772-8864-4af1-b185-ae4d3d980c66-0
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:43.442
Another creature, similar to the
men's old creature, but but

e6cfb772-8864-4af1-b185-ae4d3d980c66-1
01:06:43.442 --> 01:06:45.940
slightly different. It looks
more like a cat.

0efc36af-9f88-4a6e-bf18-c7785b45210b-0
01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:50.611
With a very long there was
holding it another chap with a

0efc36af-9f88-4a6e-bf18-c7785b45210b-1
01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:54.355
pointy hat he has is having
having shave on on on the

0efc36af-9f88-4a6e-bf18-c7785b45210b-2
01:06:54.355 --> 01:06:58.792
sidewalk there's a a barbershop
and shaving him, the boy with a

0efc36af-9f88-4a6e-bf18-c7785b45210b-3
01:06:58.792 --> 01:07:03.230
similar pointy hat He had wooden
hair, he's standing behind him

0efc36af-9f88-4a6e-bf18-c7785b45210b-4
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:07.737
watching the man getting shaved
and also some giant hermit crabs

0efc36af-9f88-4a6e-bf18-c7785b45210b-5
01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:11.619
walking down the sidewalk. There
seem to be very large.

8157932b-3ce8-453d-bac3-80ab20fa6ebf-0
01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.750
Maybe 12 inches or more in
height.

545dc02a-1e81-4364-8b15-ed58e43b96ca-0
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.270
And there's a.

d7dc33d4-9143-4560-a656-690c42edd4dc-0
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.531
Pair of buskers, one playing a
peculiar violin. Another one has

d7dc33d4-9143-4560-a656-690c42edd4dc-1
01:07:25.531 --> 01:07:29.890
a music stand and a very odd box
which looks like a combination.

1b1a0d89-4d4b-4992-9c6d-7da699f14c08-0
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.350
Between an accordion and
trumpet.

f87f808a-712e-46f1-812b-cec2ca9aa3ef-0
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.010
He's wearing a hat and he's
wearing a.

68e90d9c-ea47-4d35-8a46-2ea5a6a518be-0
01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.350
Wind color and a necktie.

abe84300-38f0-48cf-9239-11c70c2d9ae6-0
01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:42.850
And on the floor this small.

f3beadf9-ff16-4627-898a-5cf4ace98d14-0
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:44.590
Pointy head

46351010-9c63-4e68-a461-b2fd9a6fee72-0
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.950
Pigeon like things they're not.
They're very odd.

c92d72bf-7ddb-4274-be2c-b3af72ca2608-0
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.080
And then we see the next book
that was at the man with her.

c370a09c-18b7-4586-94d1-e4d7540a7dcf-0
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:57.390
With a spike lizard in a basket
on the contraption which is

c370a09c-18b7-4586-94d1-e4d7540a7dcf-1
01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:01.961
issuing smoke or steam and he
might well be selling well. I

c370a09c-18b7-4586-94d1-e4d7540a7dcf-2
01:08:01.961 --> 01:08:06.912
don't know, maybe cups of tea or
I don't know, it's hard to say,

c370a09c-18b7-4586-94d1-e4d7540a7dcf-3
01:08:06.912 --> 01:08:11.635
but he's a street vendor or some
discription like an old pram

c370a09c-18b7-4586-94d1-e4d7540a7dcf-4
01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:16.130
with wheels and this wooden
boxes fixed to them somewhere.

a24ce614-bbe3-4607-835e-2132e4c5e174-0
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.789
Another couple of woman's
something giant eggs they are

a24ce614-bbe3-4607-835e-2132e4c5e174-1
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:21.140
about.

9f39eab7-6e4f-4178-ba9c-2e1961d9835d-0
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.220
2 feet in length.

d506ff3c-9d55-4c7a-b1e9-ac4d10728e93-0
01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:27.560
Giant chicken neck.

a1bd0bb5-34de-4a4e-ba2d-0a3e15954d24-0
01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:35.406
12345 We're all sitting in a row
and it was the inside or outside

a1bd0bb5-34de-4a4e-ba2d-0a3e15954d24-1
01:08:35.406 --> 01:08:39.650
there's riding on the wall and
he was looking at her.

a42ad940-8fa1-4f1a-bd88-25e3940f7917-0
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:41.310
Looking at a.

9a7e62b2-daf0-4679-b46e-c43bfc81fe73-0
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:46.216
We will be the newspaper,
though, and the reading, what's

9a7e62b2-daf0-4679-b46e-c43bfc81fe73-1
01:08:46.216 --> 01:08:50.483
what's being talked about? And
well, with the woolly hat is has

9a7e62b2-daf0-4679-b46e-c43bfc81fe73-2
01:08:50.483 --> 01:08:54.550
one of these peculiar creatures
on her lap. She's holding it

9a7e62b2-daf0-4679-b46e-c43bfc81fe73-3
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:55.750
tightly. Run away.

18b25758-6697-4d5c-8a78-ca0f05cdbea1-0
01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.935
Long years as well as like a
rabbit. But of course it's not

18b25758-6697-4d5c-8a78-ca0f05cdbea1-1
01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.160
anything like a rabbit.

a40ce23f-f649-4c56-aeab-4a613f4882a9-0
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:05.561
And then we finish off the the
man with the hat has a suitcase

a40ce23f-f649-4c56-aeab-4a613f4882a9-1
01:09:05.561 --> 01:09:09.271
now, and he's standing, looking
around with his chin in his and

a40ce23f-f649-4c56-aeab-4a613f4882a9-2
01:09:09.271 --> 01:09:12.807
pondering what to do next. There
is someone with the bicycle

a40ce23f-f649-4c56-aeab-4a613f4882a9-3
01:09:12.807 --> 01:09:16.286
behind him and a man and a child
ignoring him totally, he's

a40ce23f-f649-4c56-aeab-4a613f4882a9-4
01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:19.880
standing in the middle of the
road, wondering the next to go.

6a76c9fa-4f24-40d5-898e-b5ca331e23bd-0
01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.510
{Next please.}

171443fe-d0b7-420a-8c59-7f79a845f2dc-0
01:09:27.150 --> 01:09:31.471
OK, a lot thumbnails on this one
that's taking the top left. He's

171443fe-d0b7-420a-8c59-7f79a845f2dc-1
01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:35.270
got a a compass of some sort in
his hand he's looking at.

586404d5-876b-4cb7-8aab-ee7135f9a27e-0
01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:40.475
Certainty very complicated
because it could be a piece, but

586404d5-876b-4cb7-8aab-ee7135f9a27e-1
01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:41.820
it might be a compass.

a160b741-860c-4fe3-ba05-d8544bce616e-0
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.820
And he's looking up now at a.

e597afdb-d563-4419-aa82-0e4cb18e6c2c-0
01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:52.430
The work gizmo on the side of a
large building this.

100846c4-0bc1-4883-acc6-854db7ef728f-0
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:57.922
Clockwork Gizmo might well be a
timepiece, but it's very strange

100846c4-0bc1-4883-acc6-854db7ef728f-1
01:09:57.922 --> 01:09:59.490
and it's quite large.

8908e383-5088-4f50-9e18-d84665f73f8e-0
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:01.740
On the side of it.

447eab73-324b-4242-b21e-2c755820d82a-0
01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.816
Top of the side of a industrial
sort of building then and

447eab73-324b-4242-b21e-2c755820d82a-1
01:10:07.816 --> 01:10:10.750
checking. I think maybe he's
checking his.

0b30dfca-6656-49c6-befa-42a411a640a1-0
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.670
Time piece against the wall and
the big building, and he's

0b30dfca-6656-49c6-befa-42a411a640a1-1
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.340
walking now.

3cb5b05e-3c64-4f3c-b73c-181ae7376dd5-0
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.699
Doing the street with his
suitcase, walking towards

3cb5b05e-3c64-4f3c-b73c-181ae7376dd5-1
01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:22.450
wherever.

f5003ad5-b47c-491a-ac22-1ae5a6cd07d3-0
01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:28.037
Decided maybe he does have a
destination in mind, or is just

f5003ad5-b47c-491a-ac22-1ae5a6cd07d3-1
01:10:28.037 --> 01:10:31.752
wandering around the city trying
to find something to do.

f5003ad5-b47c-491a-ac22-1ae5a6cd07d3-2
01:10:31.752 --> 01:10:35.468
Something someone should be.
Doesn't seem to have a great

f5003ad5-b47c-491a-ac22-1ae5a6cd07d3-3
01:10:35.468 --> 01:10:37.389
purpose. He's really lost and.

c8771089-70cf-45ad-ad13-dc06c3536642-0
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:41.999
Looking around, looking up,
looking down, looking left and

c8771089-70cf-45ad-ad13-dc06c3536642-1
01:10:41.999 --> 01:10:46.351
right. And then we see could be
snowflakes but I think it may be

c8771089-70cf-45ad-ad13-dc06c3536642-2
01:10:46.351 --> 01:10:50.368
lights appeared in the in the
background he's surrounded by

c8771089-70cf-45ad-ad13-dc06c3536642-3
01:10:50.368 --> 01:10:54.385
large little dots of light.
These trusted grasp one and and

c8771089-70cf-45ad-ad13-dc06c3536642-4
01:10:54.385 --> 01:10:58.335
and and we cannot live. Wind
blows up and it blows his hat

c8771089-70cf-45ad-ad13-dc06c3536642-5
01:10:58.335 --> 01:10:58.670
away.

f7bb759a-c06d-4521-bdd2-52278060318e-0
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.714
He goes to pick it up and then
he notices on the ground a map,

f7bb759a-c06d-4521-bdd2-52278060318e-1
01:11:03.714 --> 01:11:07.464
so he puts his hat on and he
sees on on the ground on the

f7bb759a-c06d-4521-bdd2-52278060318e-2
01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:11.150
sidewalk and map with for the
directional arrows so that

f7bb759a-c06d-4521-bdd2-52278060318e-3
01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:15.160
presumably there is going to
tell him where you're to go with

f7bb759a-c06d-4521-bdd2-52278060318e-4
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.846
his next stage. And he's
comparing the map on the ground

f7bb759a-c06d-4521-bdd2-52278060318e-5
01:11:18.846 --> 01:11:22.920
that's painted or carved into
the ground, he's comparing them.

b3c24260-5fca-479c-9565-9867ef871bc9-0
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.740
With a book he has which is
taken out of his suitcase.

3a5e3137-e7d5-4d30-b100-6838321ae9d9-0
01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:31.119
And he's doing that. Someone
taps him on their shoulders and

3a5e3137-e7d5-4d30-b100-6838321ae9d9-1
01:11:31.119 --> 01:11:32.180
he looks up, startled.

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-0
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:37.094
And it's a man in a Middleton
garments of the foe by day with

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-1
01:11:37.094 --> 01:11:41.338
the funny hat. And this man is
explaining something or asking

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-2
01:11:41.338 --> 01:11:45.377
him what do you want the man
that this thing him. And he's

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-3
01:11:45.377 --> 01:11:49.622
thinking about it. He's like
you. And he used to help for men

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-4
01:11:49.622 --> 01:11:54.140
on the hotel would have only had
the men he's writing down in his

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-5
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.453
notebook. He's drawn a picture
of the bed. So he's saying, can

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-6
01:11:58.453 --> 01:12:02.697
you help me? I need a room for
the night and says, ah, yes, I

38ef9ea7-6e5e-4c44-9a31-6da76d1564c5-7
01:12:02.697 --> 01:12:03.039
know.

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-0
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:07.736
What you mean come this way? And
I probably saying, oh, cousin

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-1
01:12:07.736 --> 01:12:11.701
who can who can help you
exactly. So they walk off to

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-2
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:16.327
presumably do, they to, to, to,
to to a hotel. And we see that

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-3
01:12:16.327 --> 01:12:20.660
the man with the suitcases
walking behind the his his Good

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-4
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.359
Samaritan who's helping him, who
has a basket over his shoulder

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-5
01:12:25.359 --> 01:12:29.765
within which there is another
peculiar creature with a long

7b059edd-8dce-42f3-93bd-db3e23ab5d8b-6
01:12:29.765 --> 01:12:32.849
pointy nose and long pointy ears
sitting.

with a nice bow and.

Large suitcase or traveling
trunk though we can worthy

01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:58.617
Of the mother and child. We see
a picture of the image just to

44d0cd5c-2500-48a0-94e4-3a39f6dc5102-1
01:15:58.617 --> 01:16:00.300
remind us of who they were.

6fd26f60-cf90-45e0-9450-388d4cc82307-0
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:05.748
And then we come back to the
kitchen area with the clock and

6fd26f60-cf90-45e0-9450-388d4cc82307-1
01:16:05.748 --> 01:16:06.030
the.

387955b8-9dc7-4087-a66e-d292b83d52a1-0
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:12.027
Teapot and they got the pen that
we saw before all all the inside

387955b8-9dc7-4087-a66e-d292b83d52a1-1
01:16:12.027 --> 01:16:16.721
dual on the in the room where
they where the man and the woman

387955b8-9dc7-4087-a66e-d292b83d52a1-2
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:17.690
are and he's.

22cb83a3-f399-420e-ade0-5abbf2b1606f-0
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:22.138
Closing back up his his
suitcases travelling case on the

22cb83a3-f399-420e-ade0-5abbf2b1606f-1
01:16:22.138 --> 01:16:24.430
kitchen table with two cups
teapot.

5e89201c-8abf-4430-9d3d-ced90c0d9c7d-0
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.454
And getting ready to embark on
his journey, whether she's going

5e89201c-8abf-4430-9d3d-ced90c0d9c7d-1
01:16:29.454 --> 01:16:33.010
or not is not not known. We only
saw 1 ticket to me.

394975f4-c0e0-432e-8de4-c5157535d79b-0
01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:37.461
Maybe he's physique is fortunate
he remains at home with the

394975f4-c0e0-432e-8de4-c5157535d79b-1
01:16:37.461 --> 01:16:40.010
child. We'll we'll see on the
next page.

9c93c622-7f44-4936-98e1-90646ea7516e-0
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:51.076
OK, so we see the child in bed
all wrapped up, under his

9c93c622-7f44-4936-98e1-90646ea7516e-1
01:16:51.076 --> 01:16:55.120
bedding, waking up, yawning,
scratching his eyes, having a

9c93c622-7f44-4936-98e1-90646ea7516e-2
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.753
bowl of porridge, looking
wistfully over towards the

9c93c622-7f44-4936-98e1-90646ea7516e-3
01:16:58.753 --> 01:16:59.370
suitcase.

e2ce6f17-7d0e-4526-90ec-d6111c8f48b4-0
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:03.595
Man is putting on his hat. The
woman is putting on a head

e2ce6f17-7d0e-4526-90ec-d6111c8f48b4-1
01:17:03.595 --> 01:17:06.960
scarf, dressing the child
warmly, the Wellington boots.

adc62e09-d110-4549-b87e-4554ba852a8d-0
01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:12.309
Woolly hat with a tassel on it,
fathers putting down his hand to

adc62e09-d110-4549-b87e-4554ba852a8d-1
01:17:12.309 --> 01:17:14.300
take hold of the girl child.

1d4cf48e-ff4a-4dc8-90b9-32f326cf3bb7-0
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.170
And they're walking.

195ba218-b6a8-40ea-ba8b-88ac96d651ac-0
01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:22.132
Down the streets and now the
morning there's three of them,

195ba218-b6a8-40ea-ba8b-88ac96d651ac-1
01:17:22.132 --> 01:17:26.901
hand in hand, heading off
towards the docks to get the

195ba218-b6a8-40ea-ba8b-88ac96d651ac-2
01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:31.496
ship perhaps, but the as a
shadow on the wall of the

195ba218-b6a8-40ea-ba8b-88ac96d651ac-3
01:17:31.496 --> 01:17:37.219
building behind them is a spiny,
spiky dragon tail type of thing,

195ba218-b6a8-40ea-ba8b-88ac96d651ac-4
01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.299
which I suspect will be.

992207f8-451c-4679-8f90-327e15279af5-0
01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:41.570
Be clear on the next page.

83d62011-715f-4c0f-ac0a-9524e83ef210-0
01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.851
OK, well no, no further mention
of the Spike Dragon Tail, but we

83d62011-715f-4c0f-ac0a-9524e83ef210-1
01:17:51.851 --> 01:17:56.478
see lots of little thumbnails of
the characters involved and

83d62011-715f-4c0f-ac0a-9524e83ef210-2
01:17:56.478 --> 01:17:57.010
though.

73e1d13b-760c-44d7-b5c2-bb99020efd1b-0
01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.374
The girl not looking happy,
looking me despondent, but I I

73e1d13b-760c-44d7-b5c2-bb99020efd1b-1
01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:04.728
think what's happening is the
father is going away and the

73e1d13b-760c-44d7-b5c2-bb99020efd1b-2
01:18:04.728 --> 01:18:07.400
mother and the child remaining
where they are.

80a26137-0419-49a0-bebe-e9bced952c9d-0
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:12.680
She's not happy. She's not not
not not weeping, but not happy.

f08c8944-ba25-4a95-8c5e-95221df4b7b5-0
01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:18.220
We see a steam engine train.

fd52f85b-0295-4e5d-91ca-29780b5473a5-0
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:23.133
Pulling into the station,
there's there's no platform,

fd52f85b-0295-4e5d-91ca-29780b5473a5-1
01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:27.500
essentially just a wide open
area with people dotted around

fd52f85b-0295-4e5d-91ca-29780b5473a5-2
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.013
with luggage waiting to board
the train which is now arriving

fd52f85b-0295-4e5d-91ca-29780b5473a5-3
01:18:32.013 --> 01:18:32.450
smoke.

f6170284-e7d2-4b21-b3ec-32be72b66177-0
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:37.850
the girl child is saying no
don't go over but so he takes

f6170284-e7d2-4b21-b3ec-32be72b66177-1
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:42.332
off his hat and on top of his
head was the origami pigeon we

f6170284-e7d2-4b21-b3ec-32be72b66177-2
01:18:42.332 --> 01:18:46.740
we saw earlier on the in the
thing in the takes the hat off

f6170284-e7d2-4b21-b3ec-32be72b66177-3
01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:51.295
and gives the child this this
origami bird to to remember him

f6170284-e7d2-4b21-b3ec-32be72b66177-4
01:18:51.295 --> 01:18:55.850
as a going away gift and they
have a hug she holds on to the.

b5aa990c-b989-4f95-b57c-24d832e9d892-0
01:18:56.690 --> 01:19:01.504
On the looks wistfully at the
other another paper guy she's

b5aa990c-b989-4f95-b57c-24d832e9d892-1
01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.510
and giving him a hug and.

2a7d12cc-00e6-47e8-81cc-cf037edcfe70-0
01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.873
He boards the train with this
case in his left hand, and the

2a7d12cc-00e6-47e8-81cc-cf037edcfe70-1
01:19:08.873 --> 01:19:13.380
mother and the girl child and
the father grasped hands as the

2a7d12cc-00e6-47e8-81cc-cf037edcfe70-2
01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:17.813
train pulled until they have to
let go and he disappears. Mr

2a7d12cc-00e6-47e8-81cc-cf037edcfe70-3
01:19:17.813 --> 01:19:18.250
train.

0b4adade-15ab-48da-8ef5-7803534429b9-0
01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:22.503
Give you small or smaller as it
goes off and it's a journey into

0b4adade-15ab-48da-8ef5-7803534429b9-1
01:19:22.503 --> 01:19:23.120
the distance.

3e2b4542-1a39-43d3-a27a-d7f489f4ee72-0
01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.781
So now it's either that or these
arrive knows he's he's boarded a

3e2b4542-1a39-43d3-a27a-d7f489f4ee72-1
01:19:33.781 --> 01:19:36.960
boat now the train has taken him
to the port.

7426b789-4ee8-4693-af6c-c3c3cb8cba0a-0
01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.210
And he's in his cabin on this
boat. We see him to Fort Hill.

7f64c3f9-4b37-40c2-9598-ed4284f6f0f9-0
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:45.178
That we've seen from from a
distance. We see a large boat

7f64c3f9-4b37-40c2-9598-ed4284f6f0f9-1
01:19:45.178 --> 01:19:48.880
now and he has three funnels
short before earlier.

936e6703-284b-409a-a359-239f1022936e-0
01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:57.690
And he's the 1 of 3 range rows
of of decks of passengers.

e6dd93a3-908e-4ecc-a76c-de535c7beddd-0
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.570
And the the image.

b09812b1-7a3d-4e71-b78a-02991ce599cb-0
01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:04.129
Because they're tighter and
tighter and tighter until we see

b09812b1-7a3d-4e71-b78a-02991ce599cb-1
01:20:04.129 --> 01:20:07.340
him through the through the
portal, sitting on the edge of

b09812b1-7a3d-4e71-b78a-02991ce599cb-2
01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:07.830
his bank.

871cd0f6-96ea-49eb-9b1f-44c418eb931f-0
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.110
Eating a bowl of.

Stew whatever with the.

877237bf-7531-4b80-9648-f95240888642-0
01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:20.396
Portrait of him in the
photograph above him and his

877237bf-7531-4b80-9648-f95240888642-1
01:20:20.396 --> 01:20:23.690

#END_arrival-1 cabin and
reminding him of home as he sets

4b1f2c71-24e4-41d6-ac08-7e76f25acc04-1
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:30.410
off on his adventure in the boat

c588e1fe-fd7f-46c2-bd30-747e44f4c31a-0

1b78bfe7-a274-4f5d-8dbc-83ceda1ed524-1

good.}

Paintings and portraits and
pictures. So I feel it's inside,

d7fea474-ab12-4c77-8f3c-4413e3b16060-1
01:22:05.482 --> 01:22:09.833
but there are literally hundreds
of people running around in all

d7fea474-ab12-4c77-8f3c-4413e3b16060-2
01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:10.770
directions or?

8993f089-11db-463f-8bec-9741b37de2c6-0
01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.110
Doing the for instance, the
fellow.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.880
Drawing a sketch. Someone has a
large.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.322
Framed picture of a king that
they're carrying around. Several

b9154305-c3b2-4f03-b3c6-3f4a2be1fa79-1
01:22:23.322 --> 01:22:24.670
people carrying this.

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:26.520
{Excuse me?}

5f5ebb55-230a-410d-8ae7-edc5fc44bf77-0
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:33.598
On the walls we have a picture
of a shark break oh, maybe about

5f5ebb55-230a-410d-8ae7-edc5fc44bf77-1
01:22:33.598 --> 01:22:38.600
6 long picture of a shark. Is it
like a balcony? A series of

5f5ebb55-230a-410d-8ae7-edc5fc44bf77-2
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.420
different?

b77293b0-18de-48b5-a08b-a48414962abf-0
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:45.179
Floors with balconies
overlooking the central area

b77293b0-18de-48b5-a08b-a48414962abf-1
01:22:45.179 --> 01:22:49.222
down there, which literally has
hundreds of people all

b77293b0-18de-48b5-a08b-a48414962abf-2
01:22:49.222 --> 01:22:53.780
clamouring and doing their own
thing in different directions.

4122ddd7-71f8-4977-871c-af2158fcca1c-0
01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.290
Pick out some.

cf9a9c98-5c65-4391-aadb-3a4d674c1cbe-0
01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:59.200
That they.

b2dfd430-ed85-429c-9a8f-94142cb85cde-0
01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:00.720
The.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:07.696
Either installing or taking down
the wall out of the the pictures

6e927e20-0c83-4415-aeb9-f5e7e80367ea-1
01:23:07.696 --> 01:23:08.540
that are.

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:13.100
On the wall in, in, in neat rows
and.

f3fce74b-6186-47a3-bea3-bf3dc968525b-0
01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.150
It's rather going up or coming
down or they're being exchanged.

eda83f70-c1f6-4da2-95f4-8f23a48bdeb9-0
01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.522
There are other pictures of
people, or there's one of the

01:23:22.522 --> 01:23:22.750
fish.

01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:28.870
One seems to be like a cat
carrying a shotgun dress.

2d1196c2-82a3-4904-a319-40aeba197089-0
01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:31.510

01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:36.064
A couple entry in a red dress
and he's wearing it, so maybe

07092dc3-37d3-4acd-b4d7-286611423b26-1
01:23:36.064 --> 01:23:39.306
it's a wedding photograph or
wedding picture of all these

07092dc3-37d3-4acd-b4d7-286611423b26-2
01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:39.530

There's.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.657
Large picture of this more
impressionist looks to have a

b3d41170-19be-4619-b884-244c436f1ebf-1
01:23:46.657 --> 01:23:48.970
large dog or a horse in the
middle of it.

094014b1-4ed8-4166-9054-9fd9299df3f1-0
01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.470
People just just wandering
around, moving around.

77145f8a-bc8c-49ca-884c-c20200c640ab-0
01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.230
And taking down?

8c0674e6-2688-4d19-a2d7-20fe6116bb2b-0
01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.865
Paintings off the walls. There's
no room for anyone to stand back

8c0674e6-2688-4d19-a2d7-20fe6116bb2b-1
01:24:00.865 --> 01:24:03.970
and and and look at the
paintings because it's there's

8c0674e6-2688-4d19-a2d7-20fe6116bb2b-2
01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:05.890
far too many people in in
picture

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:06.940
Well.

01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:11.663
Difficult to see any puddles
behind it, or just lots of

0493484c-74ac-47a0-8eb6-eb2aa7973084-1
01:24:11.663 --> 01:24:14.730
people doing their own thing or
brightly colored.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.306
Other than that, don't think of
much to say about it was just

7e52a3c7-44be-4191-abe7-1ce44f94ff67-1
01:24:23.306 --> 01:24:25.160
lots of pictures and lots of
people.

the work beginning where I think
on a new stretch of wall that

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:41.418
hasn't got fixed it. Maybe
they're working on loading that

01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:42.372
After the excitement of the few
days, the lake is the perfect

f2750846-fde7-4c54-bec5-75044cb53394-1
01:25:42.372 --> 01:25:46.374
place for the Penguins to lie
back and relax in the sunshine,

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.020
of course.

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:50.530
There's plenty to keep the young
ones entertained.

indeed of a lake with mountains

01:31:12.398 --> 01:31:17.528

pointy horns on its on its nose.

and that's floating down through

b9e57d48-0884-4040-9b27-065e0f3fd4e7-5
01:35:22.949 --> 01:35:27.316
People standing in the palm
trees in the branches watched

b9e57d48-0884-4040-9b27-065e0f3fd4e7-6
01:35:27.316 --> 01:35:29.499
the battle there and see you.

7f906450-6337-47a5-9b87-2e764fe4d4a9-0
01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:31.220

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.972
There are many more biotech
industry than there are vendors

d232a172-b5cc-46be-930b-1140fc7f2106-1
01:35:36.972 --> 01:35:40.735
upon it, but they're trying to
defend themselves. They're

d232a172-b5cc-46be-930b-1140fc7f2106-2
01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:44.562
firing mega, there have blue
uniforms, many defenders have

d232a172-b5cc-46be-930b-1140fc7f2106-3
01:35:44.562 --> 01:35:48.520
blue uniforms, and the pirates
are in all manner of colours.

7973081f-03df-4492-93b9-8ffd99847ff4-0
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:55.503
Maybe. Maybe the thoughts are
blue. I've already arrived on

7973081f-03df-4492-93b9-8ffd99847ff4-1
01:35:55.503 --> 01:35:56.120
the ship.

1e1dead3-b8dd-4f97-a029-7b0a369c3e7d-0
01:35:57.150 --> 01:36:02.512
Taking control of it as a pirate
ship firing a cannon toward the

1e1dead3-b8dd-4f97-a029-7b0a369c3e7d-1
01:36:02.512 --> 01:36:07.545
the sheer attacking and the
cannonball was broken. The masks

1e1dead3-b8dd-4f97-a029-7b0a369c3e7d-2
01:36:07.545 --> 01:36:12.577
and it's impacted the shore
think it's days are numbered now

1e1dead3-b8dd-4f97-a029-7b0a369c3e7d-3
01:36:12.577 --> 01:36:14.970
the Pirates are going to win.

52bb157b-19a9-4cc8-9560-866d44d8ac9a-0
01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:20.275
No Penguins in this one, that I
can tell. There's things

52bb157b-19a9-4cc8-9560-866d44d8ac9a-1
01:36:20.275 --> 01:36:21.720
supposed to have Penguins.

7f16dc42-1ea4-41e8-b478-19a329ec1540-0
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.930
Good.

bdf5a74f-1089-4f55-959b-5fbc4b43f74a-0
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:27.810
 interesting that 1234 has
examine 8910.

97d6f9ad-336d-4778-a8f9-4892df091c6d-0
01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:31.120
Maybe 20?

858e6f87-771f-4c59-b162-9e784e81cae8-0
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:36.180
Rain boats. You the giant squid
in the middle of it all the

858e6f87-771f-4c59-b162-9e784e81cae8-1
01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:40.800
giant green squid poking out of
the water and whose side is on.

c85ca87c-7b7a-4cdd-9890-2880bdacb981-0
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:46.956
But the guys and doesn't need to
be firing but you can see is

c85ca87c-7b7a-4cdd-9890-2880bdacb981-1
01:36:46.956 --> 01:36:47.480
mouth.

4a7b3d48-bfa2-4dac-a162-7ed1d4de1d1b-0
01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:57.499
Yeah, more and more people off
the land, the board boats and

4a7b3d48-bfa2-4dac-a162-7ed1d4de1d1b-1
01:36:57.499 --> 01:37:02.201
going towards the ship, some
small boats coming back to the

4a7b3d48-bfa2-4dac-a162-7ed1d4de1d1b-2
01:37:02.201 --> 01:37:03.690
land from from the.

01:37:04.890 --> 01:37:05.050
Yeah.

f0480014-e76b-4696-9741-8a3498ea5da0-0
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:07.050
They go down.

4d053330-8c71-4897-9e68-85a0fb8b2b93-0
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.604
They've taken prisoners that
they've given them ashore. One

4d053330-8c71-4897-9e68-85a0fb8b2b93-1
01:37:12.604 --> 01:37:16.719
small boat has sunk, is broken
into two pieces, and that's

4d053330-8c71-4897-9e68-85a0fb8b2b93-2
01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:19.230
sinking just offshore, no one
says.

0c4ca8ff-3404-4f29-a483-bb20aeccae7d-0
01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:23.094
They're all doing about their
own business looking for

0c4ca8ff-3404-4f29-a483-bb20aeccae7d-1
01:37:23.094 --> 01:37:23.540
Penguins.

0ce9a720-e7d0-48c6-ac07-3f78c9672118-0
01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:35.992
Strangely, there's a pirate if a
larger one sees were fired a

0ce9a720-e7d0-48c6-ac07-3f78c9672118-1
01:37:35.992 --> 01:37:37.640
cannon? A small ship?

de973d5f-f233-4f23-a4db-2208e7510135-0
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.421
So whether these small boats are
in fact you've got the big ships

de973d5f-f233-4f23-a4db-2208e7510135-1
01:37:42.421 --> 01:37:46.312
that's being attacked, maybe the
people using the small boats

de973d5f-f233-4f23-a4db-2208e7510135-2
01:37:46.312 --> 01:37:48.070
lifeboats have to to escape.

fcfee830-c5e4-4065-9f32-996246f1222b-0
01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:52.657
Or maybe the virus shot the
wrong boat. Certainly they shot

fcfee830-c5e4-4065-9f32-996246f1222b-1
01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:54.490
this shot of the small boat.

961102e3-0515-4635-a428-67bcb8d31f5d-0
01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:05.491
People falling overboard the
splashes and one hits the

961102e3-0515-4635-a428-67bcb8d31f5d-1
01:38:05.491 --> 01:38:09.759
ground. The cannons golf and
like great cloud of smoke,

961102e3-0515-4635-a428-67bcb8d31f5d-2
01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:14.637
cannonball dropped to the ground
and into the sea about 20 feet

961102e3-0515-4635-a428-67bcb8d31f5d-3
01:38:14.637 --> 01:38:16.390
away. That didn't work.

42942d5f-0b2a-41f9-aef6-b8d152669bbe-0
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:22.028
People jumping off the side of
the ship, cannonballs flying all

42942d5f-0b2a-41f9-aef6-b8d152669bbe-1
01:38:22.028 --> 01:38:22.900
over the place.

f270667a-0f31-4ced-ab74-7818a7bac5fd-0
01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:29.279
Oddly, cannibals the pirate.
Small pirate shivers fired his

f270667a-0f31-4ced-ab74-7818a7bac5fd-1
01:38:29.279 --> 01:38:33.864
cannon and chopped a palm tree
in half, though I don't think

f270667a-0f31-4ced-ab74-7818a7bac5fd-2
01:38:33.864 --> 01:38:36.720
they're very, very competent
pirates.

34f94083-2cbf-4a99-930a-f1bae5b84447-0
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:42.453

lot of fun and excitement saved.

01:38:42.453 --> 01:38:42.990
{Perfect.}

all. Yeah, that's perfect. Oh,

66e57013-87cf-47d5-9b60-0fd84bd0c877-1
01:38:49.261 --> 01:38:51.760

#START_ancient_rome Fun and

01:39:27.063 --> 01:39:30.110
games in ancient Rome. There you
go, we have the.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.206
See the Colosseum again, it's
thrown people. Or watching what

68c273c0-29b1-4bc2-bd41-4ab023f60bfe-1
01:39:35.206 --> 01:39:39.599
ensuing in the arena down below.
And lots and lots he's going on.

68c273c0-29b1-4bc2-bd41-4ab023f60bfe-2
01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:43.194
We've got Chariots. We got
lions. Lots of people with

68c273c0-29b1-4bc2-bd41-4ab023f60bfe-3
01:39:43.194 --> 01:39:43.660
Spears.

01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:46.180
Gladiators fighting each other.

01:39:47.890 --> 01:39:49.840
All the crowd.

01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:56.970
Getting involved in the process.

01:39:58.510 --> 01:40:02.365
Yeah, I can't see. Yes, I can
see Caesar is on his podium

1a977909-86f1-4198-8352-5420fa643354-1
01:40:02.365 --> 01:40:04.160
overseeing the whole thing.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:10.428
Lines are forming themselves
into a pyramid and using that to

01:40:10.428 --> 01:40:14.648
climb out and go, and you have
these spectators that they're

70e09ff1-8fae-4d37-a544-2050623cbab7-2
01:40:14.648 --> 01:40:18.729
escaping the arena and climbing
over the wall and into the

01:40:18.729 --> 01:40:20.320

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.985
Interesting Caesar behind the
rank of zandura. The phalanx

2e523bf9-e478-435e-b45d-1cd38315e30e-1
01:40:26.985 --> 01:40:32.970
perhaps is called, so he should
see for, at least for now.

f5a2aa5e-9a6a-4ccc-bfc5-436b6ac0edf4-0
01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:37.660

trying to escape the arena.

f5a2aa5e-9a6a-4ccc-bfc5-436b6ac0edf4-1
01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:41.408
Therefore you're human ladder
and climbing atop people each

f5a2aa5e-9a6a-4ccc-bfc5-436b6ac0edf4-2
01:40:41.408 --> 01:40:43.970

randomly eating people one lion

ready for his supper.

Strangely, there's a Chariots
were the horse is sitting where

884e5130-b084-42bf-9bc6-021c0dfcc6b2-1
01:41:04.930 --> 01:41:10.575
the where the where the driver
ought to be, and he's now

884e5130-b084-42bf-9bc6-021c0dfcc6b2-2
01:41:10.575 --> 01:41:16.220
lashing the two souls who were
pulling the horse in the.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:33.774
My lions seem to be having the
most one. There's some some

81b748a0-82ab-4ad2-a2a3-7c748996b6fa-1
01:41:33.774 --> 01:41:36.410
leopards as well. They're
devouring people.

they're running away or they're

bottom of the screen seems still
to be watching the games and see

01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:14.335
Well, they're actually being
attacked by lions. They seem to

77c5d9b6-77c6-47e6-a78c-a8198259d70c-1
01:42:14.335 --> 01:42:17.246
be taking more seriously and
they're running away, which

77c5d9b6-77c6-47e6-a78c-a8198259d70c-2
01:42:17.246 --> 01:42:17.909
quite wisely.

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:25.655
There's someone sitting in a
paddling pool in the middle of

ad0b7838-bc38-4f77-af30-1a6f45f60abd-1
01:42:25.655 --> 01:42:28.790
all this, while alive with a
knife and fork in his hand, is

ad0b7838-bc38-4f77-af30-1a6f45f60abd-2
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:29.940
ready to do that next.

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:40.050
One person is being punched by a
strong man, and the person is.

35f17f7e-7a00-4960-8df2-88b6500fedcd-0
01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.155
Flying backwards, leaving his
shoes behind as the strongman

35f17f7e-7a00-4960-8df2-88b6500fedcd-1
01:42:46.155 --> 01:42:48.420

Dedicated to Josephine. I don't
know why, because the writing is

01:44:01.426 --> 01:44:02.850
too small. But we see.

01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:06.790

The street level, there's a
mailbox.

feeaab44-fad2-495f-860e-c72717c3366c-0
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:15.490
The fire hydrant and traffic
lights.

And they do not cross red handed
one way arrow, one way St Arrow.

36b70c6d-75ad-4616-ac63-e3aa7f9eafb7-1
01:44:23.142 --> 01:44:26.783
And then we have another
building where sidewall has been

36b70c6d-75ad-4616-ac63-e3aa7f9eafb7-2
01:44:26.783 --> 01:44:30.550

see what's happening inside.

01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:36.130
And also we see below the level
of the street. I think we've

4a6675ad-9140-4ed8-a014-5be39c6fd4ed-1
01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:40.130

maybe not this, this, the scene.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.420
Will we see and under below
street that we see the?

01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:54.303
33 year old and playing together
on a skateboard and bicycle and

c7ed02ef-2f9f-4723-a8b3-3081949d17e2-1
01:44:54.303 --> 01:44:58.370
the child standing on to one
side with a crayon. And I think

c7ed02ef-2f9f-4723-a8b3-3081949d17e2-2
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:02.170
we've seen a boy with a crayon
before, so maybe this is.

40d468d2-54ee-4459-aea5-ce085480e6d3-0
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.659
For one, from that girl just
sitting, looking despondent,

40d468d2-54ee-4459-aea5-ce085480e6d3-1
01:45:08.659 --> 01:45:14.555
sitting on a on the steps of
building with red scooter not,

40d468d2-54ee-4459-aea5-ce085480e6d3-2

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:22.409
one you push along with
yourself? But it's bright red

fe36f845-d3f9-4416-84d6-cb2b96c3415d-1
01:45:22.409 --> 01:45:26.374
that's leaning against near fire
hydrant. She's looking to

fe36f845-d3f9-4416-84d6-cb2b96c3415d-2
01:45:26.374 --> 01:45:30.743
understand, waiting to go and do
something in the building we've

fe36f845-d3f9-4416-84d6-cb2b96c3415d-3
01:45:30.743 --> 01:45:34.910
had cut away. We could see the
rooms inside fellow, would he,

fe36f845-d3f9-4416-84d6-cb2b96c3415d-4
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:36.860
resting his chin on his wrist

73d9475a-f18e-4144-832e-1cfaa5dc0adf-0
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.400
With the bookcase behind for
the.

01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:47.026
Volume to the ticket on his
wall. So he's a student or a or

90f2f788-598b-44f6-a841-702e70c2eaa0-1
01:45:47.026 --> 01:45:52.686
a professor of the big. Perhaps
the girl child was looking at

90f2f788-598b-44f6-a841-702e70c2eaa0-2
01:45:52.686 --> 01:45:52.960
it.

01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.610
I found the languishing on the
sofa beneath it landscape.

01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:08.354
We see the staircase coming
down. He is wallpaper into the

b8e03694-4f23-454e-9704-570801b88cbb-1
01:46:08.354 --> 01:46:10.920
hallway where there's a large.

b8535703-98eb-463f-a538-77cdf4c00ca3-0
01:46:11.710 --> 01:46:17.139
Chinese. Uh, flowers under the
table from the hall table to

b8535703-98eb-463f-a538-77cdf4c00ca3-1

Will you be the mother or the
wife is cooking in the kitchen.

1507ea5b-1b02-4db3-944e-5604e1eb6622-1
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:28.570
She got a pan of something on
the stove and there.

preparing supper perhaps.

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.540
There is one bird in the sky one

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.020
Pigeon or seagull?

ac4dd21e-97bb-4555-815f-81e80320b365-0
01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.810

buildings.

There we go.

01:46:57.450 --> 01:47:01.581
Let's say it's the mother. She's
preparing the girl.  child is

53706b45-24d9-49ae-9773-fceb990f38cf-1
01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:05.516
helping her. She got the red
scooter she's brought indoors.

53706b45-24d9-49ae-9773-fceb990f38cf-2

saucepan lifted the lid and
making sure summer is OK. While

01:47:13.582 --> 01:47:17.647
she's doing that, she's also on
the phone. one of those older

53706b45-24d9-49ae-9773-fceb990f38cf-5
01:47:17.647 --> 01:47:21.844
telephones with the endless cord
that you can wander around the

01:47:21.844 --> 01:47:24.139
house with it tucked under the
ear

01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:29.417
Now child is gone to interfere
with her father, who's still

01:47:29.417 --> 01:47:30.940
working on his computer.

peering intently into the

01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:39.890
screen, and the girl child is
dragging behind it a red kite

b4d52b9f-17b5-486e-9bd5-169195ec99bb-0
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:45.006
And leaning on like her father's
chair and presumably asking

b4d52b9f-17b5-486e-9bd5-169195ec99bb-1
01:47:45.006 --> 01:47:45.740
questions.

f5ce2d6f-e537-4539-9440-db0aa10dfa49-0
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:51.536
Then the winds below that is
obvious. Sofa, we see the girl

f5ce2d6f-e537-4539-9440-db0aa10dfa49-1
01:47:51.536 --> 01:47:55.660

01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:00.140
with another girl next to her.
Not sure what that's doing with

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:04.691
suzuya. Smaller individual with
maybe a red ball. She's resting

01:48:04.691 --> 01:48:05.900
her chin on that.

01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.550
They're both.

Had a feet on the sofa sitting
on either end of it, facing each

9bffb30a-eb1b-4bbe-b4ab-2e10eba24491-1
01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:16.940
other. Then we have another
picture of a room with the dog.

bdfc1ee1-fb44-4f88-8e9b-774ba9e27a9b-0
01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:22.379
Held up in the Gray could be a
cat, suppose on his bed on the

bdfc1ee1-fb44-4f88-8e9b-774ba9e27a9b-1
01:48:22.379 --> 01:48:26.965

We have the same same scene cat.
It was a cat, not a dog. The cat

01:48:46.011 --> 01:48:50.226
is now walking out through the
open doorway and the child is

cba71d2b-c2ea-4ab5-8240-9d4496c838b3-2
01:48:50.226 --> 01:48:54.442
getting ready to get up off the
bed. There's papers and pens

cba71d2b-c2ea-4ab5-8240-9d4496c838b3-3
01:48:54.442 --> 01:48:57.759
dotted on the floor where the
cat was laughing.

2610f4a6-61f6-478c-82c8-4a576cfdb17b-0
01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.410
the child on the floor picking
up the crown?

16308eec-4426-4dd3-aa86-5cae98f0cf96-0
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:08.670
And drawing a doorway of the
wall into the into the wall, and

16308eec-4426-4dd3-aa86-5cae98f0cf96-1
01:49:08.670 --> 01:49:13.257
which has which transforms it
has made the door, and we see

16308eec-4426-4dd3-aa86-5cae98f0cf96-2
01:49:13.257 --> 01:49:18.150
the child disappearing through
the red door into the next page.

ce93700e-9f29-4fd9-b082-b817e228b8e3-0
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:26.437
Which is a park like scene with
a river or stream meandering

ce93700e-9f29-4fd9-b082-b817e228b8e3-1
01:49:26.437 --> 01:49:31.494
through the limit, large trees,
tall trees and lanterns

ce93700e-9f29-4fd9-b082-b817e228b8e3-2
01:49:31.494 --> 01:49:36.280
suspended on on wires between
and amongst the trees.

2b318e9b-dc3c-4252-9c07-3055dd359d3c-0
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:42.273
The the red door that is opened
from the main trunk artery and

2b318e9b-dc3c-4252-9c07-3055dd359d3c-1
01:49:42.273 --> 01:49:46.940
through the open door we see the
Charles bedroom beyond what it.

fd840161-724e-4ced-ae1c-14243f35d920-0
01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.980
Came from his bedroom into this
magical.

eb9b1f8e-e85a-4b09-a347-83150c907f6a-0
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:53.890
Forest with.

8e8df7c7-db4c-48eb-ab4c-2389bcdddf19-0
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:59.547
Lanterns. what else is in this
scene. I think that maybe cat is

8e8df7c7-db4c-48eb-ab4c-2389bcdddf19-1
01:49:59.547 --> 01:50:04.112
there, if indeed it was a cat,
cat, whatever. It's bad was. It

8e8df7c7-db4c-48eb-ab4c-2389bcdddf19-2
01:50:04.112 --> 01:50:08.750
seems to their head, the child,
nothing floating on the stream.

0495e28b-e9ac-4a0c-909b-1dcf371fac51-0
01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:10.220
With.

8e01038c-0f82-4052-822d-a1a49d37fe28-0
01:50:12.150 --> 01:50:14.740
On the next page and the next
bit of the adventure, here we

8e01038c-0f82-4052-822d-a1a49d37fe28-1
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:14.870
go.

53eb76f7-257c-4183-8355-075004842b10-0
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:21.068
Charles is still in the in, in,
in, in wood with the lanterns

53eb76f7-257c-4183-8355-075004842b10-1
01:50:21.068 --> 01:50:22.870
suspended from the trees.

e1ba7497-c6a8-4cfe-b5f7-f2d59b00c669-0
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:29.013
No other creatures in in in
evidence. It's standing at the

e1ba7497-c6a8-4cfe-b5f7-f2d59b00c669-1
01:50:29.013 --> 01:50:32.340
edge of a small pier key.
They're called.

dd555f0d-dec8-4100-b716-e74360d9b90f-0
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:37.434
And now it's leaning over the
edge of the of the pier and

dd555f0d-dec8-4100-b716-e74360d9b90f-1
01:50:37.434 --> 01:50:42.078
drawing a boat. With the process
of drawing the boat, it's lying

dd555f0d-dec8-4100-b716-e74360d9b90f-2
01:50:42.078 --> 01:50:46.222
on its she's lying on her
stomach with her heels together

dd555f0d-dec8-4100-b716-e74360d9b90f-3
01:50:46.222 --> 01:50:50.366
up in the air, and now the boat
has become a ride in. The

dd555f0d-dec8-4100-b716-e74360d9b90f-4
01:50:50.366 --> 01:50:54.653
child's jumped in it and is
heading off downstream, leaving

dd555f0d-dec8-4100-b716-e74360d9b90f-5
01:50:54.653 --> 01:50:57.439
leaving the land and the first
behind.

4d5e2dde-dfc7-4e68-bb11-b9fa33da32cb-0
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.500
{Thanks.}

01:51:03.090 --> 01:51:05.150
And we have a.

0dea9608-5a44-4b3a-a812-c2382c84b21e-0
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:09.040
Castle Falls City.

1716e45c-5cfa-42b2-ace2-8570b619190a-0
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:14.540
With the boot and the lake and
the windmill in the background.

8586aa6e-50ab-416b-bd7e-b429f3ea808c-0
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:17.590
And bridge and.

f33e6b3d-97c3-4bf4-aeff-7d3e260d11cd-0
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:23.108
Aqueduct above it, waterfalls
coming out of one of the

f33e6b3d-97c3-4bf4-aeff-7d3e260d11cd-1
01:51:23.108 --> 01:51:23.810
building.

908ee615-15ad-4a35-bf07-6a8081e089e0-0
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:28.073
Large, quite a quite a number of
building this wall the city

908ee615-15ad-4a35-bf07-6a8081e089e0-1
01:51:28.073 --> 01:51:31.711
rather than that walled city I
think. But there is a castle in

908ee615-15ad-4a35-bf07-6a8081e089e0-2
01:51:31.711 --> 01:51:35.465
there somewhere in the in the in
the background within this Wall

908ee615-15ad-4a35-bf07-6a8081e089e0-3
01:51:35.465 --> 01:51:36.390
City there is a.

0ef5bcbb-0020-43bf-8149-3aa13810d2c7-0
01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:42.342
Building calculations, not
balconies. Not many people in

0ef5bcbb-0020-43bf-8149-3aa13810d2c7-1
01:51:42.342 --> 01:51:47.407
Athens. There's a gondolier type
thing being being pulled across

0ef5bcbb-0020-43bf-8149-3aa13810d2c7-2
01:51:47.407 --> 01:51:51.850
the aqueduct under the city,
with another one just going

0ef5bcbb-0020-43bf-8149-3aa13810d2c7-3
01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:54.500
through a Golden cup of
building.

58bcce63-a372-468e-aa76-7adb6856451e-0
01:51:56.450 --> 01:52:01.227
The girl child is approaching
from the bottom left of the

58bcce63-a372-468e-aa76-7adb6856451e-1
01:52:01.227 --> 01:52:03.040
image in its red boat.

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.310
Small tributary that that this
could be.

7cf49ff9-fd5d-4966-aaed-0199f9232229-0
01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:14.364
Going to go over the small
aqueduct going over the the

7cf49ff9-fd5d-4966-aaed-0199f9232229-1
01:52:14.364 --> 01:52:19.472
river or Moat and we're making
through making her way inside

7cf49ff9-fd5d-4966-aaed-0199f9232229-2
01:52:19.472 --> 01:52:21.900
the wall sitting on the boat.

94705a36-5ff6-41f0-b1ff-70b5374df222-0
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:25.090
{Yep.}

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:34.257
So we're in some building down
on on on the city from above,

ac447876-4266-4d7c-8903-f810fc82ba38-1
01:52:34.257 --> 01:52:38.876
and there are indeed 1231 fourth
into four, at least four

ac447876-4266-4d7c-8903-f810fc82ba38-2
01:52:38.876 --> 01:52:42.460
different aqueducts with
gondolas upon them.

ed7d793f-8679-4852-ab7e-4a195ff32d24-0
01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:48.108
The girl is driving in her red
boat and people are waving her,

ed7d793f-8679-4852-ab7e-4a195ff32d24-1
01:52:48.108 --> 01:52:52.577
greeting her welcome. Welcome to
the city. There's a fellow in

ed7d793f-8679-4852-ab7e-4a195ff32d24-2
01:52:52.577 --> 01:52:56.550
the militaries looking on the
road, 1234 people waving.

8e213153-f55e-41ff-b65c-714e9bd7c2e0-0
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:58.280
Waving at her.

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.710
123 gondolas and other aqueducts
as a.

78bedf72-67a2-48cf-bf05-97f8502d7727-0
01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.390
Shiny golden statue at one of
the towers.

d6e618d2-c78c-4d4f-9b20-f25cd83749d7-0
01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:15.330
And we can look down on roads of
all this is moving from the moat

d6e618d2-c78c-4d4f-9b20-f25cd83749d7-1
01:53:15.330 --> 01:53:17.010

The.

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:22.600
Old parody buildings like.

5512cad9-34c9-483a-83a9-2a9a6f61fa7f-0
01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:28.583
Mock Tudor, ideally the black
and white buildings and maybe in

5512cad9-34c9-483a-83a9-2a9a6f61fa7f-1
01:53:28.583 --> 01:53:30.030
the distance more.

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.090
Industrial.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.300
Miss Flamboyant style
architecture.

827f8065-83cb-432f-9292-5d4c1c569dd8-0
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:39.790
{Yep, that's it.}

fc2671ae-3432-4cd4-b697-5e250461eebc-0
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:48.969
Here we have the girl child
coming to the end of the

fc2671ae-3432-4cd4-b697-5e250461eebc-1
01:53:48.969 --> 01:53:53.627
aqueduct and it suddenly stops
and she's about to plummet over

fc2671ae-3432-4cd4-b697-5e250461eebc-2
01:53:53.627 --> 01:53:55.550
the edge down a waterfall.

d245c33e-b671-45b4-95f2-668396e88933-0
01:53:56.290 --> 01:53:59.946
Was two other gondolas on
different levels of watching

d245c33e-b671-45b4-95f2-668396e88933-1
01:53:59.946 --> 01:54:02.540
her, the men in the balcony
above her.

a8fe4606-39b8-4920-aaf4-5e66be822ec1-0
01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:08.004
Seems to be shouting at him
back, child efficiently viewing

a8fe4606-39b8-4920-aaf4-5e66be822ec1-1
01:54:08.004 --> 01:54:11.818
and reading, maybe ringing a
bell. She doesn't is oblivious

a8fe4606-39b8-4920-aaf4-5e66be822ec1-2
01:54:11.818 --> 01:54:13.980
to this until she realizes
she's.

ddfc7fab-a9df-45c3-a31c-9ecae12e0563-0
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:20.412
Folding the red boat away and
the girl child falls through the

ddfc7fab-a9df-45c3-a31c-9ecae12e0563-1
01:54:20.412 --> 01:54:22.720
earth, spinning through the air.

01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:27.554
As she does so, she's drawing a
circle with a red crayon. A

b1d0c20e-f8eb-4739-bf98-3d9962102d8d-1
01:54:27.554 --> 01:54:31.300
magic crayon. Unless she falls,
she's drawing something too.

34a22f16-6dd4-408d-a827-773dc707ecf0-0
01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:34.260
You will rescue her on the next
page.

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:43.150
And it is indeed the things you
withdrawing was a should be red

01:54:43.150 --> 01:54:47.936
hot air balloon with a red
basket that she's in. And she's

01:54:47.936 --> 01:54:52.721
heading toward the top, the
interesting Golden sculptor on

fa10c625-7413-4410-a352-225184374582-3
01:54:52.721 --> 01:54:54.830
the sculpture, which is a.

c73b56dc-8835-48be-aff1-7d403c8dbfb6-0
01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:01.740
Sailing boat. It's a weather
vane and heading towards that.

3185b8b8-159f-4c03-942b-a8ad71fb3bb8-0
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:07.593
Building, and there are two
people waving at her. Welcoming

3185b8b8-159f-4c03-942b-a8ad71fb3bb8-1
01:55:07.593 --> 01:55:07.830
her

01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:11.220
The next thing we see is a.

01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:18.270
More mechanical, flying steam
driven paddle boat.

01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:21.390
Which is in the clouds with a.

01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:28.616
Mythical bird flying below and
the smaller flying boat also in

919f5cc1-28f7-4dac-b458-dd9c7b09db66-1

02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:23.955
The flying paddle steamer, but
it's very oversized kind of.

07b752e7-a3a8-4e9f-b17b-4f68f68681ba-1
02:02:23.955 --> 02:02:28.104

02:02:28.104 --> 02:02:32.401
because the purple difficult
bird is returned and brought

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:53.534
The bird is is watching what the
giant is drawing. All we see at

b7d9a369-c765-429a-96c0-b0b874115b93-1

She's drawn a magic carpet, of
course, and escaped the cage.

02:03:04.111 --> 02:03:07.270
She's always looking down on the
wall.

02:03:38.321 --> 02:03:43.452
the the scene. The girl is on
his magic carpet, flying away

02:03:43.452 --> 02:03:49.010
