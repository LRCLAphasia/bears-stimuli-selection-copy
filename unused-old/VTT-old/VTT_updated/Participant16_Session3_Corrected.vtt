Alright, so continuing with our
study, the this item is a

84acbb2a-baa6-4900-8c81-6670200c0386-1
00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:14.207
complex scene and please take
between three and five minutes

84acbb2a-baa6-4900-8c81-6670200c0386-2
00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:17.440
to describe what you see in this
scene.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.910
#START_deep_sea_divers This is a
where where is Waldo puzzle.

3081cbc7-8a83-4a51-8da0-f6843517e869-0
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.250
It's in full color. It's called
the deep sea divers. We see

0164865c-3668-41ec-a7c7-8117a42c417d-0
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.411
The boats on people on the
surface of the water and we see

0164865c-3668-41ec-a7c7-8117a42c417d-1
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:43.430
a lot of things underwater.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.844
Lots of red and white stripes,
which is Waldo's signature

49151de6-60c0-4b08-ae04-5deb75b89ce0-1
00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:56.377
color. So it really is going to
be hard to pick out where Waldo

49151de6-60c0-4b08-ae04-5deb75b89ce0-2
00:00:56.377 --> 00:01:00.700
is. Under the water, my oh my
there are mermaids.

4436d727-4eda-437b-b669-be0435d07c22-0
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.838
There are fish with people legs,
lots of mermaids, fish with two

4436d727-4eda-437b-b669-be0435d07c22-1
00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:14.551
tails, lots of lots of scuba
divers and undersea figures. Oh

4436d727-4eda-437b-b669-be0435d07c22-2
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:20.358
here. Here's an angry looking
fish that looks like a rock and

4436d727-4eda-437b-b669-be0435d07c22-3
00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:22.700
an angry looking octopus.

This is a very busy scene.

ad4f3b9b-99a4-42d0-b760-f42b3cd1b284-0
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.377
On the surface of the water,
again, there are lots of boats.

ad4f3b9b-99a4-42d0-b760-f42b3cd1b284-1
00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:36.530
There, mermaids on rocks there
people fishing from rocks.

236707a3-5718-4c4e-93cc-6afa30773910-0
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.310
Ah, that looks like a big
alligator about to eat one boat.

b8eebd61-8357-403a-8b8c-ee9408d20e5b-0
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.636
Uh, lots and lots of people
fishing. Here, however,

b8eebd61-8357-403a-8b8c-ee9408d20e5b-1
00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:54.250
underwater, I see a fish with a
net who's about the net a

b8eebd61-8357-403a-8b8c-ee9408d20e5b-2
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.943

00:02:03.955 --> 00:02:04.910
fish. Oh my.

ebda0ca1-4285-4fba-a21c-1828eee20cb6-0

That was about 3 minutes.
Alright, that's enough. Alright.

43d48f5f-4da8-448e-95cc-eb51ec18c5f4-1
00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:19.390
So moving forward to the next

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.047
#START_arrival_4 This is a
graphic novel with several

3bd62780-211e-40f7-b840-7a24a318f2cd-1
00:02:57.047 --> 00:03:02.616
panels. Sepia is the main color.
We begin with a man getting up,

3bd62780-211e-40f7-b840-7a24a318f2cd-2
00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:08.100
shaving, getting dressed, tying
his shoes. He gets his pat, his

3bd62780-211e-40f7-b840-7a24a318f2cd-3
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.584
hat, checks, a map goes out in
the city. Oh, it's a fantastical

3bd62780-211e-40f7-b840-7a24a318f2cd-4
00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:18.725
city with teepee like buildings
and the man now seems to be

3bd62780-211e-40f7-b840-7a24a318f2cd-5
00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:22.410
waiting on a railroad siding,
perhaps. And

6398d6ef-cf7c-4384-89ed-df62e6eec00b-0
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.170
we see lots of airships floating
through high arch uh high

6398d6ef-cf7c-4384-89ed-df62e6eec00b-1
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.840
arches. {Next panel.}

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.556
These little creatures are
meeting ohh I see the man is

45c72266-02a5-42a5-9f93-c9f8fcde0495-1
00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:41.147
asking directions from a woman.
She's checking the map and

45c72266-02a5-42a5-9f93-c9f8fcde0495-2
00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:46.282
helping to put him out point out
with him it looks like he gets a

45c72266-02a5-42a5-9f93-c9f8fcde0495-3
00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:51.339
ticket or she gets a ticket and
passes it on to him. And here is

45c72266-02a5-42a5-9f93-c9f8fcde0495-4
00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:56.240
an airship coming into land and
it looks like these people are

45c72266-02a5-42a5-9f93-c9f8fcde0495-5
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.220
the man is getting on with his
long tailed mouse like creature.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.299
His ticket is stubbed and he's
pointed into, I guess, the

2d94c7f5-dc10-4155-9f78-9c8e660e7a42-1
00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.820
airship. {next panel.}

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.294
Now we see the man sitting on a
park bench and a woman is next

cb4a70ef-edf2-4b11-bb66-68c24a041b47-1
00:04:19.294 --> 00:04:24.926
to him. They're talking. They
each have a pet with them. He

cb4a70ef-edf2-4b11-bb66-68c24a041b47-2
00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:30.653
takes out of his Jack inside
jacket pocket what looks like a

00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:35.910
wanted poster. She takes out
one, too, and they compare

cb4a70ef-edf2-4b11-bb66-68c24a041b47-4
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.289
photographs, maybe identity
papers.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.386
Now, in a grayer series of
panels, a young lady is reading

7998a802-bca2-493b-8988-146bc26a67e4-1
00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:48.622
a book and someone is trying to
take it from or does take it

7998a802-bca2-493b-8988-146bc26a67e4-2
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:52.996
from her, locks it into, locks
it into a drawer, and gives her

7998a802-bca2-493b-8988-146bc26a67e4-3
00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:57.092
a shovel and makes her shovel
into the furnace. I guess as

7998a802-bca2-493b-8988-146bc26a67e4-4
00:04:57.092 --> 00:05:01.120
punishment for reading that
forbidden book. {next panel.}

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.831
We're looking down a long tunnel
of furnaces. Each one is being

fd9de826-e58d-4c27-b612-bff8967981b2-1
00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:16.470
fed by a girl in a skirt. Our
girl is.

fabb79ae-75f4-4f7c-a80e-acdfead1d245-0
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.566
Sitting on in despair, picks up
a shovel and she pries open a

fabb79ae-75f4-4f7c-a80e-acdfead1d245-1
00:05:23.566 --> 00:05:28.866
door. She goes back and takes
the book out of its drawer and

fabb79ae-75f4-4f7c-a80e-acdfead1d245-2
00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:34.513
seems to be running away with it
and has crawled onto a railroad

fabb79ae-75f4-4f7c-a80e-acdfead1d245-3
00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:39.205
train boxcar and we see the
train driving away on its

fabb79ae-75f4-4f7c-a80e-acdfead1d245-4
00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.030
tracks. {next panel.}

69dc2195-2dc9-499e-a4f5-2eeb9392dc41-0
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.701
An airship is floating in the
sky, passed a billboard. Here

69dc2195-2dc9-499e-a4f5-2eeb9392dc41-1
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:53.113
are the two people on their
bench, again with their pets. A

69dc2195-2dc9-499e-a4f5-2eeb9392dc41-2
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:57.672
man calls to them through the
megaphone. They shake hands. He

69dc2195-2dc9-499e-a4f5-2eeb9392dc41-3
00:05:57.672 --> 00:06:02.231
gets on. It looks like it's on
the airship, and we see a long

69dc2195-2dc9-499e-a4f5-2eeb9392dc41-4
00:06:02.231 --> 00:06:04.289
view of a strange landscape.

b64ab6b4-83be-4e2f-a66c-a89d5041d201-0
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.602
With a series of switchback
walkways that come up the slope

b64ab6b4-83be-4e2f-a66c-a89d5041d201-1
00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:17.100
toward him. {next panel.}

be5d8de8-3586-47f2-a6a2-80ed604cb04a-0
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.920
The man is walking through the
town with his pet.

062b58e1-f9d7-4849-bba4-66c001721bf3-0
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.870
We see a number of tentacles.

85fc10e0-1604-4a4c-950d-88d37d8983a7-0
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.360
Here's a woman, perhaps getting
a.

18a7df12-3e67-4b29-a628-73d109e2e5a9-0
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.310
I'm not sure what I'm seeing
here.

9ced5b27-df2d-47d1-b16d-1c806935905d-0
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.443
Man is walking through the city.
A woman takes something out of

9ced5b27-df2d-47d1-b16d-1c806935905d-1
00:06:56.443 --> 00:07:01.839
an automat, perhaps. In the next
panel an older woman is showing

9ced5b27-df2d-47d1-b16d-1c806935905d-2
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.329
a fish like creature to a man.

ac2d8d4c-6269-441a-9d99-0d7b193780c0-0
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:11.548
Uh, our gentleman's out on the
street again. He's looking at a

ac2d8d4c-6269-441a-9d99-0d7b193780c0-1
00:07:11.548 --> 00:07:14.290
book of maybe translations.

12294a73-93f9-4a00-95ba-a56d502c6f35-0
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.250
And.

8dadce33-d93a-4d51-b8ba-e2bc52d8373f-0
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.901
His pet creature with the long
tail is trying, is looking in a

8dadce33-d93a-4d51-b8ba-e2bc52d8373f-1
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:31.341
drawer. The man opens the drawer
and sees several creatures

8dadce33-d93a-4d51-b8ba-e2bc52d8373f-2
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:35.240
inside. He checks his book,
takes one out.

2813a71a-e21a-40aa-b144-2a90d8c7d9bd-0
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.550
And gives it to a boy. Ohh. I
don't know what's going on here.

4b8de523-9295-4221-8d62-6e1ce53bcd89-0
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.240
Uh.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.951
He's trying to translate bread.
Someone reaches into a box like

30b091b5-8195-4871-9fd5-54d9a1a50e25-1
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:58.090
an automat or postal box and
takes out.

3c0a6f20-38d4-4b87-a2aa-fe4573678c5f-0
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.904
A curved item like a gourd and
gives it to the man with the hat

3c0a6f20-38d4-4b87-a2aa-fe4573678c5f-1
00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:08.869
who brings it to his lips, and
the boy brings a basket for him

3c0a6f20-38d4-4b87-a2aa-fe4573678c5f-2
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:12.810

him. {next panel.}

Yeah.

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:25.700
boy holds a cornucopia.

5f4ad662-fa8b-44db-96c9-52e79241e260-0
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.001
A man in the vest is tasting
something. Here's a boy with a

5f4ad662-fa8b-44db-96c9-52e79241e260-1
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:33.810
big artichoke like item.

0fd142f2-e964-4343-923a-8eb14bd10626-0
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.270
The uh series of people are
handling edible objects that are

0fd142f2-e964-4343-923a-8eb14bd10626-1
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.106
strange fruits with tails or
stems and animals. The pet is

0fd142f2-e964-4343-923a-8eb14bd10626-2
00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:45.679
fed and

d8eef3bb-af04-4ca0-be7a-2153d77a75e0-0
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.890
They are carrying baskets of
food and take a walk along the

d8eef3bb-af04-4ca0-be7a-2153d77a75e0-1
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.690
Quay where a number of little
boats are docked.

0c9992b1-5642-4194-93cb-d33f89fba56a-0
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.050
They're on the pier rather, not
the Quay, I guess.

25aea5f9-b328-416b-90a9-f2a044d6a7eb-0
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:06.240
Yeah.

12c26cd9-8fa3-4359-840f-e4741bb051db-0
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.243
The story continues. The boy
with the basket and and the

12c26cd9-8fa3-4359-840f-e4741bb051db-1
00:09:16.243 --> 00:09:21.615
tailed pet go to a jar and
there's something growing out of

12c26cd9-8fa3-4359-840f-e4741bb051db-2
00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:26.449
the jar. A dragon like tail,
scaled thorned tail and.

4d686f4e-e594-426e-aac4-c7cdd9b93e22-0
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:35.919
The boy embraces what comes out
of the urn, this slanty cat like

4d686f4e-e594-426e-aac4-c7cdd9b93e22-1
00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:42.299
item with a long scaly tail and
the animal makes friends with

4d686f4e-e594-426e-aac4-c7cdd9b93e22-2
00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:48.680
the fish pet. The two of them
play together like cat and dog.

029fbe64-74d3-4ee9-b0d6-f5f2db2a3bea-0
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.218
The man in the hat and suit is
trying to communicate to the man

029fbe64-74d3-4ee9-b0d6-f5f2db2a3bea-1
00:09:59.218 --> 00:10:03.487
in this in suspenders he tries
to act it out with his hands and

029fbe64-74d3-4ee9-b0d6-f5f2db2a3bea-2
00:10:03.487 --> 00:10:07.756
then draw it with in his book.
He shows it to the man who seems

029fbe64-74d3-4ee9-b0d6-f5f2db2a3bea-3
00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:11.892
to be trying to explain back to
him what he sees in the book.

029fbe64-74d3-4ee9-b0d6-f5f2db2a3bea-4
00:10:11.892 --> 00:10:13.560

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.830
This part of the story.

a056ec01-95fc-43c0-8f71-4df497d9448c-0
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.890
OK. So moving on to the next
item.

8a2a7b4f-9d2e-4e01-82dd-9e6dab0b80df-0
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.442
About 3 pages. And again, just
describe what you see if you go

8a2a7b4f-9d2e-4e01-82dd-9e6dab0b80df-1
00:10:28.442 --> 00:10:29.940
through the story.

00c82690-4890-4467-8513-57d91a78f80b-0
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.556
#START_arrival_2 Ohh two women
several women are sitting

00c82690-4890-4467-8513-57d91a78f80b-1
00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:42.568
together with the hoods over
their head. In the next panel we

00c82690-4890-4467-8513-57d91a78f80b-2
00:10:42.568 --> 00:10:46.690
see several men in caps and
suits. They look like.

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-0
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.025
They look like immigrants. And
we see one man writing in his

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-1
00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:57.708
book on several pages. He tears
out one page and folds it into a

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-2
00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:02.104
little boat, or rather into a
bird and releases the bird and

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-3
00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:06.787
he goes and looks up to the sky.
They're on a boat. Yes, they're

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-4
00:11:06.787 --> 00:11:11.543
on a boat. And the sky is filled
with these dragonfly like winged

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-5
00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:16.010
birds. People are on the deck
looking at them and they fly in

6cfa44ac-883c-43e9-a647-245f7a9102a3-6
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.740
orderly, straight lines.

08c02f3d-94e1-4806-86e8-a5259673c966-0
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.910
Across the sky. {next panel} Now
we see a big view of a

08c02f3d-94e1-4806-86e8-a5259673c966-1
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.646
metropolis. And in the
foreground there are people.

08c02f3d-94e1-4806-86e8-a5259673c966-2
00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:32.109
Immigrants it looks like, on the
deck of a ship.

94ab3c50-e5b1-4109-bd4f-beaf2b646a93-0
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:40.680
And in a larger view, we see two
giant figures shaking hands.

ca459592-2661-462f-853e-79916a769d2d-0
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.150
One has.

acc874de-de11-4d49-923e-6bf731dc610a-0
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:53.084
Is that called a fez? F-E-Z. And
the other has a conical hat.

acc874de-de11-4d49-923e-6bf731dc610a-1
00:11:53.084 --> 00:11:58.519
They're on. They're standing on
big boats in the harbor and they

acc874de-de11-4d49-923e-6bf731dc610a-2
00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:03.370
loom over our little boat and
over the cityscape horizon.

bb4b1ba0-ea5d-4f2d-8cb6-1ca088890ef8-0
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:18.189
{I'm sorry, next page} we see
this, the prow of the big

bb4b1ba0-ea5d-4f2d-8cb6-1ca088890ef8-1
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:23.638
steamship looming into harbor
with its decks lined with

bb4b1ba0-ea5d-4f2d-8cb6-1ca088890ef8-2
00:12:23.638 --> 00:12:24.320
people.

99cd0056-e8c3-43d3-80a3-5287d240e389-0
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:31.472
Now the people are getting off
and on boarding a man with a man

99cd0056-e8c3-43d3-80a3-5287d240e389-1
00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:32.940
with a megaphone.

d0dc9e98-e655-4cff-8f47-1a324f8343df-0
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.688
Points them the way they come
off with their suitcases and

d0dc9e98-e655-4cff-8f47-1a324f8343df-1
00:12:37.688 --> 00:12:39.610
line up on the pier.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.350
Two more items on 26, yes. Two
more. OK, I've got a message.

67d1d74a-3854-482a-ae1f-6dc92522e8d3-0
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.360
I'm ready.

d824e9a6-c20f-413c-828c-876a20a10756-0
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.270
This is also part of the graphic
novel about 2 pages, yes.

9a14da1f-fb1a-4edc-b175-dab067488816-0
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.727
#START_arrival_3 These are
Street scenes in what looks like

9a14da1f-fb1a-4edc-b175-dab067488816-1
00:13:07.727 --> 00:13:12.567
a ghetto. There are strange
languages. First we see a boy

9a14da1f-fb1a-4edc-b175-dab067488816-2
00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:17.992
with uh poster signs and they're
in a strange language. We see a

9a14da1f-fb1a-4edc-b175-dab067488816-3
00:13:17.992 --> 00:13:23.249
woman with an apron holding a
long tiered long tailed cat like

9a14da1f-fb1a-4edc-b175-dab067488816-4
00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:28.507
creature. I here's a man with a
pushcart steaming. A man and a

9a14da1f-fb1a-4edc-b175-dab067488816-5
00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:30.260
woman with huge eggs.

18812aa9-7fdf-49bd-b1f0-2a63553bf6df-0
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.968
Barber who's shaving a passenger
with these snail like creatures

18812aa9-7fdf-49bd-b1f0-2a63553bf6df-1
00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:42.336
on the floor. Here's a man with
a gramophone and a boy playing a

18812aa9-7fdf-49bd-b1f0-2a63553bf6df-2
00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:47.539
fiddle with strange bird like
creatures on the floor. Here's a

18812aa9-7fdf-49bd-b1f0-2a63553bf6df-3
00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:48.200
line of.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.230
There's a line of people.

89bd5d4f-cfd0-4880-a167-7524b8241837-0
00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.077
Against a tapestry in a strange
tongue. And here's a man looking

89bd5d4f-cfd0-4880-a167-7524b8241837-1
00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:04.545
puzzled with the suitcase as if
he's trying to find his

89bd5d4f-cfd0-4880-a167-7524b8241837-2
00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.860
directions out on the street.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.551
The man checks his watch and
then checks it against the time

c7165187-f7a4-4864-a855-82f40c2ca7f3-1
00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:23.821
on the tower clock. He's the man
with the suitcase from the

c7165187-f7a4-4864-a855-82f40c2ca7f3-2
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:28.020
previous panel and he's finding
his way through the street

c7165187-f7a4-4864-a855-82f40c2ca7f3-3
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.590
streets.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.771
Some lights begin to descend
like snowflakes. He reaches up

c35338a6-42b3-4ed0-ba5f-9e113c001b7f-1
00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:39.205
and touches one. First they've
been floating down. Now they've

c35338a6-42b3-4ed0-ba5f-9e113c001b7f-2
00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:43.849
pelt down and knock his, his hat
blows off. He retrieves it. He's

c35338a6-42b3-4ed0-ba5f-9e113c001b7f-3
00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:48.000
looking at what looked like
hieroglyphic directions on the

c35338a6-42b3-4ed0-ba5f-9e113c001b7f-4
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.363
pavement. He takes out his book
and checks through the pages.

c35338a6-42b3-4ed0-ba5f-9e113c001b7f-5
00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:55.529
And while he's kneeling down,
reading, a man

a9fb18b4-0dd5-4b2e-8faa-4c2ad75c5a87-0
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:03.816
I think it's called a fez,
F-E-Z, those round hat. A man in

a9fb18b4-0dd5-4b2e-8faa-4c2ad75c5a87-1
00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:09.781
a turban hat and a naver jacket
addresses him. The man asked him

a9fb18b4-0dd5-4b2e-8faa-4c2ad75c5a87-2
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:15.471
something. He in turn answers.
The man shows him a drawing in

a9fb18b4-0dd5-4b2e-8faa-4c2ad75c5a87-3
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:16.939
his book, a bed.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.555
Ah, says the man in the fizz,
and he gives him directions and

8295508a-47d7-4041-be58-7fe5fa4c4c7b-1
00:15:22.555 --> 00:15:26.732
in fact seems to be leading him
the way to what I assume are

8295508a-47d7-4041-be58-7fe5fa4c4c7b-2
00:15:26.732 --> 00:15:27.760

And on the back, on a basket on
his back.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.432
The man in the naver jacket has
this horned pet riding on his

242fed88-65b9-4bfc-a3af-68fb9cb06550-1

Uh, we see a series of items a a
bird folded from paper, a mantle

31dd99b9-e9db-46d7-8757-d0722b18e598-1
00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:33.220
clock. A hat and dish towel on
pegs. A cooking pot.

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-0
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:39.099
A child's drawing of her family,
a teapot, a cup and saucer, and

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-1
00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:43.055
some money, an open suitcase.
And then another view of the

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-2
00:16:43.055 --> 00:16:47.347
family photo. Now we see a man
and a woman closing the suitcase

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-3
00:16:47.347 --> 00:16:51.572
on the kitchen table. There are
two cups and a pot. They're on

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-4
00:16:51.572 --> 00:16:55.462
the table as if they've been
drinking before they or soon

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-5
00:16:55.462 --> 00:16:59.888
will be. The cups are filled and
on the mantle we see most of the

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-6
00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:04.046
and on the wall behind them we
see most of the items from the

a5fcb7ba-1074-4d81-a8b7-61c45f456360-7
00:17:04.046 --> 00:17:04.650
separate.

3d844017-c901-4eb0-80a3-1018152e134a-0
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.770
uh photo. In fact, I think we
see all of them there, yes.

13c24aba-3185-4531-8da6-07e4725b7b61-0
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:11.810
So.

98fb6c8d-ebf9-4014-b2c4-f57b760343ac-0
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.315
Now we see it. I was going to
say. So the little photos, the

98fb6c8d-ebf9-4014-b2c4-f57b760343ac-1
00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:24.531
big photo is a composite of the
littler photos a little. The

98fb6c8d-ebf9-4014-b2c4-f57b760343ac-2
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:28.977
little little photos are
excerpts from bigger photo

98fb6c8d-ebf9-4014-b2c4-f57b760343ac-3
00:17:28.977 --> 00:17:30.260
drawing. Sorry.

6e40c5ea-0f7d-4cfd-b303-d1a974611f7b-0
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.510
OK.

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-0
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.873
Young girl's sleeping. She
begins to Rouse. She wakes up

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-1
00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:42.206
and stretches, has hers cereal
or oatmeal. There's a suitcase

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-2
00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:46.119
on the floor. There's a man
putting on his hat. There's

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-3
00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:50.592
mother putting on her headscarf.
She buttons up the little girl

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-4
00:17:50.592 --> 00:17:54.925
while the little girl puts on
her hat and her boots, picks up

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-5
00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:59.257
the suitcase. The father reaches
for her hand and they in the

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-6
00:17:59.257 --> 00:18:03.730
next photo we see the three of
them walking as if away from the

e18f34ea-bbdc-4508-b7f2-31dd37172176-7
00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:04.080
door.

ad7b94f1-211e-4444-a505-e76a885370f9-0
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.443
And above them, above the shadow
of the wall, we see a long

ad7b94f1-211e-4444-a505-e76a885370f9-1
00:18:08.443 --> 00:18:08.940
thorned

0e58dea3-4351-4842-95e3-2dc52fc4b71f-0
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.490
tail.

5ae976ee-deda-4011-88b1-d9a12486ad14-0
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.946
The curvature of the tail. We
see several views of the little

5ae976ee-deda-4011-88b1-d9a12486ad14-1
00:18:17.946 --> 00:18:22.520
girl, her hand being hands being
held, and now we see them.

92b87893-c46a-4810-b58c-f4a8d3596bf9-0
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.733
People waiting for train coming
in. Uh, the little girl looks

92b87893-c46a-4810-b58c-f4a8d3596bf9-1
00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:32.926
anxious. There's a man's. Her
father's hand is on her

92b87893-c46a-4810-b58c-f4a8d3596bf9-2
00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:37.817
shoulder. He lifts his hat, and
then on his head is the folded

92b87893-c46a-4810-b58c-f4a8d3596bf9-3
00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:41.700
up paper bird, which he gives to
the little girl.

eb0e36b8-c5a1-42c4-a3d4-5f78859e1a7b-0
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.626
She's so happy to have it. She
hugs him and treasures it in her

eb0e36b8-c5a1-42c4-a3d4-5f78859e1a7b-1
00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:53.993
hand. The mother is weeping, and
now father and mother embrace.

eb0e36b8-c5a1-42c4-a3d4-5f78859e1a7b-2
00:18:53.993 --> 00:18:58.856
He whispers something into her
ear, and now he boards the

eb0e36b8-c5a1-42c4-a3d4-5f78859e1a7b-3
00:18:58.856 --> 00:18:59.360
train.

d497cde8-f559-4a24-ba77-8f5dc12b419c-0
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.908
We see hands, a woman and a
child's hands holding. We see

d497cde8-f559-4a24-ba77-8f5dc12b419c-1
00:19:05.908 --> 00:19:11.070
the train disappearing and then
vanishing into the distance.

91c6045a-0e8c-4645-9716-fc7f32f10005-0
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:22.214
Again, we see the family photo.
We see the little girl eating

91c6045a-0e8c-4645-9716-fc7f32f10005-1
00:19:22.214 --> 00:19:27.396
her oatmeal with the photo in
the background on top of the

91c6045a-0e8c-4645-9716-fc7f32f10005-2
00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:33.017
trunk. No, his father eating his
oatmeal. You see a larger view

91c6045a-0e8c-4645-9716-fc7f32f10005-3
00:19:33.017 --> 00:19:38.198
now through a kind of aperture
circle lens. We see farther

91c6045a-0e8c-4645-9716-fc7f32f10005-4
00:19:38.198 --> 00:19:43.379
turning toward the viewer,
again, still seated and eating.

799a584b-ad32-4ac0-8ad0-c9e76b045fc8-0
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:50.281
Now we see a smaller aperture
view. Now we see three, still

799a584b-ad32-4ac0-8ad0-c9e76b045fc8-1
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:52.200
smaller, and now.

a49df097-d363-4071-84ff-bb6d2eebbd9e-0
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.995
A dozen. It looks like very
small views. Now we see the side

a49df097-d363-4071-84ff-bb6d2eebbd9e-1
00:19:58.995 --> 00:20:04.325
of a ocean liner, which picks up
those circles as if it's farther

a49df097-d363-4071-84ff-bb6d2eebbd9e-2
00:20:04.325 --> 00:20:09.493
on the ocean liner. And in the
last panel we see a distant view

a49df097-d363-4071-84ff-bb6d2eebbd9e-3
00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:14.500
of the the ocean liner, three
stacks steaming. #END_arrival_1

cc199850-f023-4c30-8c8b-13264fe6ac37-0
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.000
OK. That is all that I have. OK.
