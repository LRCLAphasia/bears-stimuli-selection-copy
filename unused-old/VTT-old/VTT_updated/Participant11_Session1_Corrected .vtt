{OK, welcome to the first
session.}

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.325
{In the in the introduction I
mentioned that there will be two

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.485
types of pictures that you will
see and that you will describe.

2b6f2c7f-553c-4e1d-b527-596aca604333-2
00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.760
The first type is graphic
novels.}

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.032
{You will see a series of
pictures that tell a story.

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:25.862
Imagine that you're telling the
story to someone who cannot see

b3aed19c-9979-4f3e-92eb-d1b7286bad57-2
00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:29.633
the picture. Describe what you
see and what is happening as we

b3aed19c-9979-4f3e-92eb-d1b7286bad57-3
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:30.950
go through the story.}

to 15 minutes to tell it.}

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.350
{OK. OK.}

eae3fc3b-8513-4c4b-b3ab-69307ccf0f80-0
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.051
{You can start when you're
ready. OK, so does this

eae3fc3b-8513-4c4b-b3ab-69307ccf0f80-1
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.672
represent 2 pages of the story?
Right? The layout is that there

eae3fc3b-8513-4c4b-b3ab-69307ccf0f80-2
00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.560
are two pages from left to
right. Yep.}

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.730
{Um.}

24d408fa-3c9c-4782-9283-a32725121086-0
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.379
#START_wanderer there are square
pictures, and the first square

24d408fa-3c9c-4782-9283-a32725121086-1
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:13.430
has a character in a kind of a
black uniform outfit.

262a057b-490e-402c-a5b9-49ca788bc809-0
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.240
With horns on the helmet.

6afeaaca-e20f-4881-bb36-54d248e4b195-0
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.112
And something that might be like
gold braiding across the front,

6afeaaca-e20f-4881-bb36-54d248e4b195-1
00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:28.816
although the pictures are just
black and white pen and ink

6afeaaca-e20f-4881-bb36-54d248e4b195-2
00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:33.998
drawings. And that character is
on the left side of the picture,

6afeaaca-e20f-4881-bb36-54d248e4b195-3
00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:38.941
kneeling down and holding down
what looks like a big piece of

6afeaaca-e20f-4881-bb36-54d248e4b195-4
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:39.420
paper.

a9909a14-1d14-4a18-8750-29954e825e36-0
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.312
And opposite the character on
the left side, no on the right

a9909a14-1d14-4a18-8750-29954e825e36-1
00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:53.630
side is a person that might be a
boy, has short hair and is

a9909a14-1d14-4a18-8750-29954e825e36-2
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.790
wearing a striped shirt and
solid colored pants.

0bf2a636-b665-4901-8c54-2b625a74be5e-0
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.820
And I think bare feet.

5710d08d-d8fa-4f05-9034-836f797580a9-0
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.280
And is holding up the other side
of the big piece of paper.

8f5fd124-f2ce-4267-b226-8055625dea29-0
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.310
And a stand. The big piece of
paper has been folded in half.

f2d4e478-bc95-4a67-96a5-e3549d05abe2-0
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.209
And the dark kneeling character
is holding down the fold, and

f2d4e478-bc95-4a67-96a5-e3549d05abe2-1
00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.177
the standing up character is
standing on the bottom piece of

f2d4e478-bc95-4a67-96a5-e3549d05abe2-2
00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:33.250
the folded paper and is holding
up the top piece.

6e16f8d4-a398-46b5-a4c8-25ed65505fa3-0
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.470
In the next picture.

721e11e7-180b-4be7-ad97-29c68ed22c80-0
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.770
Hmm.

1dc26fe0-aaa7-4314-bd4b-9fd30e40629d-0
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.150
And the next picture.

32e6eb45-e7e3-4ef0-a06f-2fa876378688-0
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.750
A corner of the top piece.

b6bd4d30-1258-40d2-83df-c24c95885892-0
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.740
Has been folded halfway in.

a1af4e44-a9c1-47e3-943d-7bc3de55c934-0
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.920
And they are working together to
fold the second-half in.

9ffd7a18-8c3f-431a-91d3-44b7cc796abd-0
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.680
And in the third picture.

90206b64-d38d-47ae-bcd1-c57014f24853-0
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.850
They're folding up the bottom
side of the top piece of paper.

dd1a5d56-a891-4854-a59b-aca85f89b50d-0
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.638
And the fourth picture, they're
opening up the folded piece of

dd1a5d56-a891-4854-a59b-aca85f89b50d-1
00:03:18.638 --> 00:03:19.290
paper.

deb21b8f-3070-491e-b2e9-837c840cd511-0
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.066
And each of these pictures, the
two characters have remained

deb21b8f-3070-491e-b2e9-837c840cd511-1
00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.940
opposite each other on the piece
of paper.

e13dd310-cc13-45b6-94ac-acbc5278e0fc-0
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.550
Um, the 4th picture.

a7d34331-b9a4-4878-aac7-b0cca7bb653a-0
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.600
They're both standing now.

76be2fb9-d31a-434d-9b41-59a2f40da9c3-0
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.130
And they're continuing to open
it up.

8eb8cf39-627c-4dcd-ae92-7d8db7af7d34-0
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.777
And I'm seeing different kinds
of points, you know, going up

8eb8cf39-627c-4dcd-ae92-7d8db7af7d34-1
00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:57.120
and down. I'm actually a little
confused by the picture.

ab4f6215-c996-4658-833c-1915be946178-0
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.064
And oh, and it looks like
they've been standing on some

ab4f6215-c996-4658-833c-1915be946178-1
00:04:05.064 --> 00:04:10.720
kind of a floor with boards and
now we're a bit.

6e8de8de-1e62-449a-9703-ba6d95d2fe7e-0
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.101
There's a little more
perspective on them and the

6e8de8de-1e62-449a-9703-ba6d95d2fe7e-1
00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:16.690
boards.

f67c7d49-7733-47b6-b80c-9ae11ef0dcb6-0
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.295
Only go out a short distance
away from them and then it looks

f67c7d49-7733-47b6-b80c-9ae11ef0dcb6-1
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:25.210
like there might be sand or
ground beyond them.

e4fdba6f-3ab1-4c14-a608-49f4dd15faa0-0
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.550
Hmm.

1d5b6eae-cf16-4133-92ac-4f0e6940c42c-0
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.300
And then in the sixth picture.

26d8fd83-b699-4411-bcd7-f0796c2e0ef4-0
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.890
They're still standing and
they've completely opened it up.

a812cdd3-a274-4bd8-8a7b-09964ab55b28-0
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.460
And it looks.

48784874-9822-4a27-95f8-6b375ffd888a-0
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.010
Like a paper hat or a sailboat.
A paper sailboat.

60ffedd3-36a3-4814-b95e-9b03048f0629-0
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.998
And I'm not sure if I'd
mentioned before that the black

60ffedd3-36a3-4814-b95e-9b03048f0629-1
00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:54.240
costumed character has a Cape on
and boots.

49670d34-7ac0-4884-9e6a-0c5eee467e02-0
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.842
And then all of those pictures
were on one page and on the next

49670d34-7ac0-4884-9e6a-0c5eee467e02-1
00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:03.250
page.

cf9e002c-70a3-4512-aed6-2f26e7014cc7-0
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.426
Oh, it's magnificent. There's a
picture of a big, fascinating

cf9e002c-70a3-4512-aed6-2f26e7014cc7-1
00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:12.940
sailing vessel.

e5f0b3cc-1176-4ec1-b958-0b1cf2d91b80-0
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.918
And we'll come back to that in a
moment. The paper boat is tiny

e5f0b3cc-1176-4ec1-b958-0b1cf2d91b80-1
00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:24.701
in comparison to the big sailing
vessel, and they're both in the

e5f0b3cc-1176-4ec1-b958-0b1cf2d91b80-2
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:29.263
water. The sailing vessel has a
port, a big portion above the

e5f0b3cc-1176-4ec1-b958-0b1cf2d91b80-3
00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:33.310
water, but it also has a portion
underneath the water.

7aa68f0b-d2df-489d-a74e-7234e8598db7-0
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.449
Underneath the water is a curved
hole with a propeller at one end

7aa68f0b-d2df-489d-a74e-7234e8598db7-1
00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.566
and then but beneath the curved
hole it looks like a diving

7aa68f0b-d2df-489d-a74e-7234e8598db7-2
00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:48.280
helmet.

950b65f5-66c9-4f2a-b552-329e6247f8cb-0
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.485
Like large enough that a person
would more than one person could

950b65f5-66c9-4f2a-b552-329e6247f8cb-1
00:05:55.485 --> 00:06:00.797
fit into it. And it it's round
and it has two round portals

950b65f5-66c9-4f2a-b552-329e6247f8cb-2
00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:01.240
with.

e8b02f13-f205-489c-b3c5-93ae42e2a43d-0
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.530
A hatched grading over both of
the windows.

3c04d588-c6aa-4ab1-aec9-291d254b5383-0
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.980
Above the water on the big
vessel.

3cc47931-483f-4612-9716-331d0a72612d-0
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.619
It has a construction at one end
that looks like a castle. It

3cc47931-483f-4612-9716-331d0a72612d-1
00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:26.366
reaches up high and has windows
in it and some roof lines, and

3cc47931-483f-4612-9716-331d0a72612d-2
00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:28.830
at the very top it has.

5e8b6e36-0d33-4ffb-b028-2d76c0c16d65-0
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.240
It has the top that looks like a
castle wall.

6eac899a-c41c-4896-86d7-fbf60e0d8c7f-0
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.283
And then in the middle of the
boat is a huge mast, at the top

6eac899a-c41c-4896-86d7-fbf60e0d8c7f-1
00:06:47.283 --> 00:06:52.688
of which are is 1 flag
fluttering and one that looks

6eac899a-c41c-4896-86d7-fbf60e0d8c7f-2
00:06:52.688 --> 00:06:58.808
like a wind sock. The flag is a
long rectangle with lots of

6eac899a-c41c-4896-86d7-fbf60e0d8c7f-3
00:06:58.808 --> 00:07:02.990
waves in it and the windsock is
striped.

c725e98b-9d26-467c-9421-b0a00b7112d4-0
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.660
Hmm.

e43396f6-9e08-4e89-b440-f55f1ce8fa95-0
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.380
Cone shaped.

6e7ad5fc-69cc-4f71-9da3-b91cb56620f6-0
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.269
But it narrows down to a point
to a tail, so kind of like a

6e7ad5fc-69cc-4f71-9da3-b91cb56620f6-1
00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:19.730
snake.

e7d381a1-c2dc-43b0-af8a-e8d0acb5719e-0
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.350
Um.

15a909fc-52bc-4cef-94e8-b037230e1cc0-0
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.708
And then further down on the
mast are many lines that come

15a909fc-52bc-4cef-94e8-b037230e1cc0-1
00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:27.060
down.

9f39fade-239c-4381-80cf-348c1f25025f-0
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:34.570
In straight lines at angles
coming down to a large crossbar,

9f39fade-239c-4381-80cf-348c1f25025f-1
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.060
there are more wind socks.

5a3dd134-62ce-4942-8aa3-c2423a74d47f-0
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:47.794
And then with the big crossbar
are even more large wind socks

5a3dd134-62ce-4942-8aa3-c2423a74d47f-1
00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:53.180
1234567 I can see and I think I
see.

b8500f98-4442-40b1-9508-e69310fb1085-0
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.840
The black costumed character
standing on the crossbeam.

df4bf9b9-5fcc-4345-8466-352af4b4763c-0
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.740
On the right hand side.

82c76c03-08c2-40d5-a696-2dfa366d3898-0
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.110
Um.

a7072bb9-0f38-4565-9a12-bccd819334b7-0
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.117
And then you go further down,
you're halfway down the mast and

a7072bb9-0f38-4565-9a12-bccd819334b7-1
00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:12.470
then.

71ee54be-aae5-4477-84bf-29f96398b731-0
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:22.156
There are lines going down that
also have lines going across, so

71ee54be-aae5-4477-84bf-29f96398b731-1
00:08:22.156 --> 00:08:27.858
it's like a ladder, but it's
123456 or 7 columns wide and I

71ee54be-aae5-4477-84bf-29f96398b731-2
00:08:27.858 --> 00:08:33.180
think I see the other character
with the striped shirt.

34d4ffe3-381f-4d9b-a727-874b3d1dac44-0
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.750
Part way up climbing.

90c437dc-e29e-417c-bb1d-1010b0cb878d-0
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:38.910
OK.

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-0
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.188
{That was a very detailed
description since, yeah, it's a

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-1
00:08:44.188 --> 00:08:47.970
bit long. Yeah, going forward,
each page. So there are two

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-2
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.624
things that I want to say. One
is, those are really good

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-3
00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:55.406
details. This is a big longer
item, so it's OK to cut that

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-4
00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:59.637
down to make the level. And then
the second thing is that this is

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-5
00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:03.483
a fiction. So a lot of the
object that you see, you may not

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-6
00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:07.522
know the exact name and just say
the closest that you can. You

b08f659d-2a8b-4bc9-ae3f-25f74f0fbc5a-7
00:09:07.522 --> 00:09:10.920
don't have to think about what
is the perfect word.}

c16ba5a7-76c5-4fa5-b925-5a26a70e5727-0
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.360
{OK. OK. Thank you. Next page.}

e53aee96-67b5-4e7e-8182-7eb041bf26da-0
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.550
{Again, if you don't see a lot,
then you don't have to.}

65a7605b-0abe-4199-91b0-5c62eeba01b2-0
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.858
{You don't have to find other
things to say,}  well, this is a

65a7605b-0abe-4199-91b0-5c62eeba01b2-1
00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:31.220
two page spread up above looking
down on the water and the paper.

00a6f0e2-e1c5-4a5c-a3d3-62b21ef33593-0
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:38.848
boat and there is a Flock of
Seagulls flying up across the

00a6f0e2-e1c5-4a5c-a3d3-62b21ef33593-1
00:09:38.848 --> 00:09:39.440
page.

0495c82e-d912-494d-b88d-d4f3ee734019-0
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.530
That was good.

52d1ee7a-7e59-498a-a27a-32f88b7b2b4f-0
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.170
Ohh and then.

c61ba4fd-d69d-4c48-885e-3e91e8b7f296-0
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.630
This is wonderful.

3b11bfc8-9366-420f-adc1-58d7bae51bda-0
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.282
On the next two pages, the first
page is a a closer up picture of

3b11bfc8-9366-420f-adc1-58d7bae51bda-1
00:09:56.282 --> 00:10:00.775
the paper boat in the water, and
there are sea creatures that

3b11bfc8-9366-420f-adc1-58d7bae51bda-2
00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:05.412
look like turtles swimming up to
it, and one is trying to climb

3b11bfc8-9366-420f-adc1-58d7bae51bda-3
00:10:05.412 --> 00:10:09.760
into it. And there's also a
seagull perching on one side of

3b11bfc8-9366-420f-adc1-58d7bae51bda-4
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.050
the.

fc355f7f-b5fb-4902-94cd-d6d6f7060083-0
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.063
Paper boat with a few seagulls
flying across above and then in

fc355f7f-b5fb-4902-94cd-d6d6f7060083-1
00:10:16.063 --> 00:10:21.186
the next picture it looks like a
kind of like a whale creature,

fc355f7f-b5fb-4902-94cd-d6d6f7060083-2
00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:25.590
which is much bigger than the
boat swimming toward it.

71dbd2d2-6c21-4096-968e-6814a4fa11ad-0
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.651
Ohh and the next two pages. The
Ohh the first page, the whale

71dbd2d2-6c21-4096-968e-6814a4fa11ad-1
00:10:35.651 --> 00:10:41.800
creature has put the paper boat
on the top of its top fin.

438358a8-ce57-418a-9d99-cc881ae03404-0
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.000
Like wearing it like a hat or a
decoration.

c74016ee-1b03-403a-8b0a-c833479ebad1-0
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.600
And.

874bed45-1412-4e90-a288-7c0bb34d9d59-0
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:54.820
Deeper in the water beneath the
whale is a swordfish swimming

874bed45-1412-4e90-a288-7c0bb34d9d59-1
00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:00.219
through a great school of
smaller fishes. It has skewered

874bed45-1412-4e90-a288-7c0bb34d9d59-2
00:11:00.219 --> 00:11:05.896
2 fishes on its big pointy nose.
And then you move into this

874bed45-1412-4e90-a288-7c0bb34d9d59-3
00:11:05.896 --> 00:11:10.829
other page, which is a
continuation of this undersea

874bed45-1412-4e90-a288-7c0bb34d9d59-4
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:16.228
picture with coral reefs and a
variety of fishes swimming

874bed45-1412-4e90-a288-7c0bb34d9d59-5
00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:16.879
around.

26f75668-cfdf-4299-9152-0c8230cc1516-0
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.190
You know, with lines and
everything.

96da06e2-bfb4-43b8-9653-705a297e9cb3-0
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:28.346
The next two pages you just see
the most of the paper boat on

96da06e2-bfb4-43b8-9653-705a297e9cb3-1
00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:34.115
the water surrounded by fishes
all around it. In the water and

96da06e2-bfb4-43b8-9653-705a297e9cb3-2
00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:39.609
deeper down in the water are
more corals and other kinds of

96da06e2-bfb4-43b8-9653-705a297e9cb3-3
00:11:39.609 --> 00:11:40.250
fishes.

cf65141c-c1ee-4936-af22-fdf07674ccce-0
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:51.534
The next two pages, one page has
the paper boat and there's some

cf65141c-c1ee-4936-af22-fdf07674ccce-1
00:11:51.534 --> 00:11:57.465
kind of like a sea crab or
creature attaching itself to the

cf65141c-c1ee-4936-af22-fdf07674ccce-2
00:11:57.465 --> 00:12:03.988
bottom, and underneath there are
many other fishes and corals and

cf65141c-c1ee-4936-af22-fdf07674ccce-3
00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:06.460
there's a a cute pair of.

52a64e71-fec0-4d94-b0db-cd701b6a2a5f-0
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:14.430
Kissing fishes that have strange
bodies with arms and hands.

3ceddfba-c132-481b-9910-c708db677f75-0
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.420
The next page has the paper
boat.

d1288c66-750f-4ac1-bbaa-5baab62dc706-0
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.139
With a fishing pole sticking off
of it and a line dropping down

d1288c66-750f-4ac1-bbaa-5baab62dc706-1
00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:29.350
and it has caught 1 fish and
there's some more fishes.

da5307bd-bc2f-4047-9c4d-60a1e1d5ffcc-0
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.710
In the landscape underneath or
the seascape beneath the boat?

547fbe34-df08-440e-bade-69a2edaa9e97-0
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.197
And the next page, the paper
boat is still in the water and

547fbe34-df08-440e-bade-69a2edaa9e97-1
00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:49.611
we have a lot of the oceanscape
underneath with more coral and a

547fbe34-df08-440e-bade-69a2edaa9e97-2
00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:54.858
variety of fishes. And right at
the top of the water is 1 fish

547fbe34-df08-440e-bade-69a2edaa9e97-3
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:59.440
in front of the paper boat with
another fish standing.

a9123dd5-f58b-4f88-8f1a-c48d7863269b-0
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.900
On the forehead of the fish
that's in the water and the fish

a9123dd5-f58b-4f88-8f1a-c48d7863269b-1
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.591
that's standing out of the water
kind of looks like a seahorse,

a9123dd5-f58b-4f88-8f1a-c48d7863269b-2
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:12.230
and it has a paper hat on its
head.

aa46ba5d-6c25-4046-9d69-d81188654941-0
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.310
The next page.

5c625447-b1cf-435f-a76a-d2113a9f3b4f-0
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:23.085
The sea horse with the paper hat
on its head that looks like the

5c625447-b1cf-435f-a76a-d2113a9f3b4f-1
00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:28.398
paper boat is now in the paper
boat and some kind of long snake

5c625447-b1cf-435f-a76a-d2113a9f3b4f-2
00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:33.628
like sea creature is reaching
into the boat and underneath are

5c625447-b1cf-435f-a76a-d2113a9f3b4f-3
00:13:33.628 --> 00:13:38.359
a bunch of Stingrays swimming
underneath the paper boat.

016ab3ae-f7f8-4cfe-97ca-c579e917b5f2-0
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.918
The next two pages the paper
boat is in the water, and now

016ab3ae-f7f8-4cfe-97ca-c579e917b5f2-1
00:13:44.918 --> 00:13:49.573
we're looking at the scenery
above the water with what I

016ab3ae-f7f8-4cfe-97ca-c579e917b5f2-2
00:13:49.573 --> 00:13:54.473
think are mangrove trees with
their roots reaching into the

016ab3ae-f7f8-4cfe-97ca-c579e917b5f2-3
00:13:54.473 --> 00:13:59.863
water, and then lots and lots of
foliage above the water reaching

016ab3ae-f7f8-4cfe-97ca-c579e917b5f2-4
00:13:59.863 --> 00:14:05.090
up far above the paper boat. And
within the foliage are lots of

016ab3ae-f7f8-4cfe-97ca-c579e917b5f2-5
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.030
birds, white birds with long
necks.

6157a47e-ca41-45db-84bc-755084cd46b0-0
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.219
Next to page spread is a close
up of the paper boat in amongst

6157a47e-ca41-45db-84bc-755084cd46b0-1
00:14:16.219 --> 00:14:20.752
the trees with the roots going
beneath the water and fishes

6157a47e-ca41-45db-84bc-755084cd46b0-2
00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:25.210
swimming around underneath the
water and a close up of the

6157a47e-ca41-45db-84bc-755084cd46b0-3
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.290
leaves and a couple of the birds
with the long necks.

9ce78050-b853-4038-9bde-0b93546affbb-0
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.470
Above water.

dc06ff39-8458-4a93-9319-4c82e149bb46-0
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:39.259
The next two page spread, it
looks like the paper boat is

dc06ff39-8458-4a93-9319-4c82e149bb46-1
00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:40.190
traveling.

b4c290b9-6150-477e-8b74-8b027d1759a9-0
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.795
Inside the the Grove of trees,
and now there are other

b4c290b9-6150-477e-8b74-8b027d1759a9-1
00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:51.040
creatures peeking out from
within the leaves.

fcbd8e75-96cf-4ee8-b82f-2602e67deb9f-0
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.902
There are strange serpent type
things, other things with arms

fcbd8e75-96cf-4ee8-b82f-2602e67deb9f-1
00:14:57.902 --> 00:14:59.800
and hands reaching down.

6cfab7f3-58fa-4858-9c00-7c7d8299f276-0
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:07.238
Ah, some tea, some glowing eyes
in the dark, and the sea horse

6cfab7f3-58fa-4858-9c00-7c7d8299f276-1
00:15:07.238 --> 00:15:11.350
is still riding along in the
paper boat.

9165ed06-6027-41f4-b52e-0e384d78dc07-0
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.130
And now

a2de990d-f168-4248-beb9-35f5d1b62315-0
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.600
The next two pages.

85d8af57-3c63-4ce7-8a96-a6193d5185b3-0
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.402
The first of them, the seahorse,
is looking out of the paper boat

85d8af57-3c63-4ce7-8a96-a6193d5185b3-1
00:15:26.402 --> 00:15:30.713
into the water and looks
curiously at something in the

85d8af57-3c63-4ce7-8a96-a6193d5185b3-2
00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:35.572
water, and the thing that it
sees is a sea creature riding on

85d8af57-3c63-4ce7-8a96-a6193d5185b3-3
00:15:35.572 --> 00:15:37.610
what looks like a lobster.

3bea4724-9660-4477-81c5-93d3d7a6e27e-0
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.940
And it has little rains that
it's holding on.

53abc31b-5667-4f7b-8117-08718b3a973c-0
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.556
Um, swimming amongst the corals
and roots of the trees. And in

53abc31b-5667-4f7b-8117-08718b3a973c-1
00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:51.597
the next picture there are also
some other sea horses coming out

53abc31b-5667-4f7b-8117-08718b3a973c-2
00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:56.406
from amongst the roots, and the
seahorse in the paper boat is

53abc31b-5667-4f7b-8117-08718b3a973c-3
00:15:56.406 --> 00:16:01.292
jumping out of the paper boat.
Its hat has come off, and there

53abc31b-5667-4f7b-8117-08718b3a973c-4
00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:05.713
are more sea creatures,
including an eel and more fishes

53abc31b-5667-4f7b-8117-08718b3a973c-5
00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:07.420
and corals beneath it.

6114c4a4-9774-4bce-8c36-501ada17e45b-0
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.230
Oh my and then in the next page.

dc2e4f08-e47e-4a46-9961-67015c8f1dac-0
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.300
The paper boat.

8d967af4-e029-4e63-9be8-3cdbd9ea30c3-0
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.929
The perspective is very tiny and
there is a huge whale next to

8d967af4-e029-4e63-9be8-3cdbd9ea30c3-1
00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:25.565
it, just a little bit of it
peeping up above the water and

8d967af4-e029-4e63-9be8-3cdbd9ea30c3-2
00:16:25.565 --> 00:16:30.436
it looks like it's smoking a
pipe. There are birds sitting on

8d967af4-e029-4e63-9be8-3cdbd9ea30c3-3
00:16:30.436 --> 00:16:35.386
top of it and flying around it
and then beneath it most of the

8d967af4-e029-4e63-9be8-3cdbd9ea30c3-4
00:16:35.386 --> 00:16:40.178
page is filled up with the size
of the great whale under the

8d967af4-e029-4e63-9be8-3cdbd9ea30c3-5
00:16:40.178 --> 00:16:40.650
water.

e2150ff9-ad8d-45d4-ad74-714462ebd5a4-0
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.270
And then the next page the whale
is.

5d4ad61f-e584-4215-b98e-1128cf555380-0
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.310
Opening its mouth, the paper
boat is now in front of.

0537bdb5-4db7-4566-8c04-86df9757ca64-0
00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:00.050
The whales face and the whale
has a little protrusion coming

0537bdb5-4db7-4566-8c04-86df9757ca64-1
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:05.090
out from the top of its head
that looks like it's hanging

0537bdb5-4db7-4566-8c04-86df9757ca64-2
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:10.564
dangling a light or a TV set.
And the whale is now showing its

0537bdb5-4db7-4566-8c04-86df9757ca64-3
00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:15.603
teeth and its eye has gotten
much bigger and brighter and

0537bdb5-4db7-4566-8c04-86df9757ca64-4
00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:20.904
it's side fins which were tiny
in the first picture are much

0537bdb5-4db7-4566-8c04-86df9757ca64-5
00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:24.379
bigger and look like lobster
claws and.

055a91f3-d8a2-4056-9ae1-414a867114ae-0
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:30.887
All across its back it has
generated lots of kind of frilly

055a91f3-d8a2-4056-9ae1-414a867114ae-1
00:17:30.887 --> 00:17:37.733
thins and curly cues, and it has
legs standing on top of sunken

055a91f3-d8a2-4056-9ae1-414a867114ae-2
00:17:37.733 --> 00:17:38.910
shipwrecks.

b535fde0-3a48-4e35-989b-0611152f0038-0
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.690
Ohh and the next picture. It's a
full two page spread.

eb8316fb-7c94-473b-9568-eec9d970e1a9-0
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.410
And the sun is setting. There's
a full moon up in the sky.

54a49e6b-1dbc-4515-9490-1269ea8106d7-0
00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:57.610
Ohh.

3e10ea24-95ae-4d6d-a891-9897e67681e0-0
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:04.218
There's the ocean below, with
all kinds of fantastical

3e10ea24-95ae-4d6d-a891-9897e67681e0-1
00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:10.445
creatures in the water and
leaping out of the water, things

3e10ea24-95ae-4d6d-a891-9897e67681e0-2
00:18:10.445 --> 00:18:16.361
that look like whales with
flapping ears and a cat and a

3e10ea24-95ae-4d6d-a891-9897e67681e0-3
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:22.900
Harlequin, jester fish and other
fishes with horns and Tooting

3e10ea24-95ae-4d6d-a891-9897e67681e0-4
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.090
horns, and then flying above our
birds and a bat.

70ac08aa-c007-49b4-8d65-f7d5f2097aad-0
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.390
All kinds of fantastical
creatures.

203c13fa-4861-4d36-9dc7-82f71ee53817-0
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:42.580
The next two page spread. It's
now dark and night time with a

203c13fa-4861-4d36-9dc7-82f71ee53817-1
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:48.940
sky filled with stars and you
can even see the the Milky Way,

203c13fa-4861-4d36-9dc7-82f71ee53817-2
00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.300
a big cluster of stars.

6bc50bb2-659b-4b4b-a741-84903372e960-0
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:58.789
Um, the Moon is a Crescent moon,
and underneath the boat which is

6bc50bb2-659b-4b4b-a741-84903372e960-1
00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:03.560
still on the water, is the ocean
with lots of.

bd7ee10c-fd89-4933-b68c-621a15601061-0
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:09.580
Glowing eyes in the water and
shadowy fish like bodies.

205146f1-630c-4221-836d-9cd53b004687-0
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:19.431
And the next two page spread.
The paper boat is on top of the

205146f1-630c-4221-836d-9cd53b004687-1
00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:25.584
water, surrounded as far as the
eye can see on the two pages by

205146f1-630c-4221-836d-9cd53b004687-2
00:19:25.584 --> 00:19:31.642
fishes who are rising up at with
their heads out of the water,

205146f1-630c-4221-836d-9cd53b004687-3
00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:33.950
all staring at the boat.

920f7c60-9e4f-49dc-b811-98191ff88ebf-0
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.467
But there's some with their
mouths open, looking amazed, and

920f7c60-9e4f-49dc-b811-98191ff88ebf-1
00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:44.396
the next picture, the two page
spread. The paper boat is on the

920f7c60-9e4f-49dc-b811-98191ff88ebf-2
00:19:44.396 --> 00:19:49.479
water, which has gentle ripples.
Only a few fish are showing now.

a818c81b-8db5-4c78-82a0-1c484fae6692-0
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.459
Turning tail and diving back
into the water and up above in

a818c81b-8db5-4c78-82a0-1c484fae6692-1
00:19:55.459 --> 00:20:00.298
the sky, which takes up most of
the two pages, looks like a

a818c81b-8db5-4c78-82a0-1c484fae6692-2
00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:04.170
rippling Aurora borealis
shimmering in the sky.

29c8bc30-fea2-41c0-9f2f-2b0fd8090041-0
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:12.221
Oh, and now on the next two page
spread, the paper boat

29c8bc30-fea2-41c0-9f2f-2b0fd8090041-1
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:18.008
apparently has traveled and is
next to a very large iceberg

29c8bc30-fea2-41c0-9f2f-2b0fd8090041-2
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.070
filling up.

dd75bcf1-060b-45fd-a3e0-55ed48ecb4ec-0
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.390
Most of the two page spread.

339ed0b2-41a5-43a8-8e5e-a939885038f2-0
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.820
And now?

976f0abe-08f9-4e14-980f-2d8ddf7f6584-0
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.846
The next two page spread has two
images, one of the ice of the

976f0abe-08f9-4e14-980f-2d8ddf7f6584-1
00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:35.950
paper boat sailing into the
mouth.

0d912dee-f32f-483b-9d5b-572968ab4bc3-0
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.900
Of an ice cave.

084fda73-14cd-4e70-a195-96459c752c38-0
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.870
And the next it is floating
through a tunnel within.

f2833789-dc3a-40aa-bb52-882e7101e7e9-0
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.600
The ice.

615ad1ca-9e6a-49ac-9d88-5c2e2d95a97e-0
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.360
The next page.

6479a68c-216f-4fc3-a09d-516c5ade5dcc-0
00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.804
It might be outside of the
iceberg again, but there is some

6479a68c-216f-4fc3-a09d-516c5ade5dcc-1
00:21:01.804 --> 00:21:06.007
strange appendage of a sea
creature rising up out of the

6479a68c-216f-4fc3-a09d-516c5ade5dcc-2
00:21:06.007 --> 00:21:06.449
water.

e4258b67-59be-4141-84b8-d09522d4d5a6-0
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.970
Illuminating.

7cdf4377-ab97-4777-a81d-155a84630b35-0
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.150
the Paper boat.

74986561-ac2d-44e8-9f4c-ca488cb5f9a6-0
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.800
And then the next picture.

a08da712-21f7-4e56-b9c6-e783bb772bd9-0
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:21.780
Ohh my we see further emerged
from underneath the water.

02788eaf-eff7-4593-911b-62e2345bf497-0
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.620
And to which the the lighting
appendage is attached is a huge.

ab4e45f2-a245-4392-affd-3e59aac69d27-0
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:35.010
Person creature in a dive suit
with a helmet and and canister

ab4e45f2-a245-4392-affd-3e59aac69d27-1
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.530
for oxygen on its back.

10bf9920-272c-43a5-991c-cc3e578a5d5f-0
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.130
And.

49a5584e-bffd-4175-9d1b-cc12ede9e03d-0
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.890
Multiple appendages with lights
and it's holding.

86ccce1e-f122-43c3-ba17-e2bc0a6470ef-0
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.340
The paper boat in one of its.

359386a2-5948-4da1-83a0-45bf9f0effcf-0
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:54.157
Appendages that looks like a
long arm with fins and fishtail

359386a2-5948-4da1-83a0-45bf9f0effcf-1
00:21:54.157 --> 00:21:55.460
fins at the end.

e13ab466-67c1-41eb-8195-32ed92bfa31f-0
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.693
And now on the next two page
spread, there's a full picture

e13ab466-67c1-41eb-8195-32ed92bfa31f-1
00:22:03.693 --> 00:22:06.110
of the boat back on the water.

976bf9fe-598f-402f-a271-d9fe4e50e135-0
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.975
And one of the lighting
appendages is above water. And

976bf9fe-598f-402f-a271-d9fe4e50e135-1
00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:18.905
there are two massive sailing
ships, not like sailboats but

976bf9fe-598f-402f-a271-d9fe4e50e135-2
00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:25.231
steamships above the water with
their holes cutting through the

976bf9fe-598f-402f-a271-d9fe4e50e135-3
00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:31.358
water and billowing smoke or
steam above them. And they have.

976bf9fe-598f-402f-a271-d9fe4e50e135-4
00:22:31.358 --> 00:22:32.940
One of them has.

a619be9b-b292-4963-a269-f4fe3b564e8c-0
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:39.622
A couple of huge fishing Nets
filled to overflowing with fish,

a619be9b-b292-4963-a269-f4fe3b564e8c-1
00:22:39.622 --> 00:22:45.310
and there's even a whale caught
by its tail hanging off the side

a619be9b-b292-4963-a269-f4fe3b564e8c-2
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.060
of one of the ships.

1a4bb6d5-0d35-499e-ba29-80c619e708e1-0
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:54.960
Ah, on the next two page spread,
the paper boat is still on the

1a4bb6d5-0d35-499e-ba29-80c619e708e1-1
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.683
water, but now it looks like it
might have a little water

1a4bb6d5-0d35-499e-ba29-80c619e708e1-2
00:22:59.683 --> 00:23:01.230
spilling out of it.

f4bc0f2f-d70f-4df0-88fc-3f0bfeed53e7-0
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:08.713
The sky is dark with clouds in
it and white birds flying or

f4bc0f2f-d70f-4df0-88fc-3f0bfeed53e7-1
00:23:08.713 --> 00:23:13.580
otherwise falling from the sky
into the water.

c12b9c00-8501-4f75-940d-20945d8444b4-0
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.450
And the other half of the two
page spread were a distance off.

c0b2e49e-8e9d-41c1-ab27-ef246ac5a777-0
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:29.327
And the ships aren't there. But
there's a big factory rising up

c0b2e49e-8e9d-41c1-ab27-ef246ac5a777-1
00:23:29.327 --> 00:23:35.105
on 3 supports from the ocean
with the towers and the

c0b2e49e-8e9d-41c1-ab27-ef246ac5a777-2
00:23:35.105 --> 00:23:41.755
platform. And again we see the
whale hanging by its tail and

c0b2e49e-8e9d-41c1-ab27-ef246ac5a777-3
00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.500
big smokestacks.

8cf458b9-25eb-4bc9-8bc8-7e190809158d-0
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:56.115
On the next two page spread, oh,
the first of the two pages, some

8cf458b9-25eb-4bc9-8bc8-7e190809158d-1
00:23:56.115 --> 00:24:02.341
windows have opened up on the
side of the ship or the tower,

8cf458b9-25eb-4bc9-8bc8-7e190809158d-2
00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:08.362
and there's some kind of a
creature with a gun firing into

8cf458b9-25eb-4bc9-8bc8-7e190809158d-3
00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:14.689
the water at the paper boat, and
there's near the paper boat.

c6c61093-1522-4809-a57f-b4e6d7f38f7a-0
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.680
A little.

365aef7e-3a94-4b39-9b78-41de69cbaf29-0
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.383
A little kind of ship with a
paddle wheel on it and one of

365aef7e-3a94-4b39-9b78-41de69cbaf29-1
00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:34.839
these diving suited creatures
riding on top of it, and there's

365aef7e-3a94-4b39-9b78-41de69cbaf29-2
00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:35.549
a big.

8be8e0ca-6033-4838-b9ba-44d386ce1e7e-0
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:42.556
Claw kind of thing on chain
reaching down from above and

8be8e0ca-6033-4838-b9ba-44d386ce1e7e-1
00:24:42.556 --> 00:24:49.581
then the next picture on the two
page spread is a close up of the

8be8e0ca-6033-4838-b9ba-44d386ce1e7e-2
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:52.030
diving suited creature.

2c654319-6705-47e9-81f1-efbc1d93f0de-0
00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:00.223
It's sailing vessel appears to
be damaged, with sparks and

2c654319-6705-47e9-81f1-efbc1d93f0de-1
00:25:00.223 --> 00:25:03.740
things coming out of its fuel
tank.

cac65f75-36e9-400f-9f2c-eb4be5440ea2-0
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.636
And the ship is sinking, and the
creature is standing on the

cac65f75-36e9-400f-9f2c-eb4be5440ea2-1
00:25:08.636 --> 00:25:08.980
nose.

85be5836-7eac-4088-89d1-13c5ef4fb5dc-0
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:15.578
Of it trying to not sink into
the water, and on his helmet

85be5836-7eac-4088-89d1-13c5ef4fb5dc-1
00:25:15.578 --> 00:25:22.022
there are some antennae and like
electric sparks coming out, the

85be5836-7eac-4088-89d1-13c5ef4fb5dc-2
00:25:22.022 --> 00:25:28.069
paper boat is there with one
shot wound in it and a big life

85be5836-7eac-4088-89d1-13c5ef4fb5dc-3
00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:29.159
buoy in it.

09fa497e-81cb-40ae-a036-3acfa2095335-0
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:37.403
Ah, and the next two page
spread. The creature in the

09fa497e-81cb-40ae-a036-3acfa2095335-1
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:43.299
diving suit is in the life buoy,
attached by a tow line to the

09fa497e-81cb-40ae-a036-3acfa2095335-2
00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:48.260
paper boat. Now the ocean is
churning up into waves.

e2c2d8d9-ce24-4096-9963-62f2004ddb09-0
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.400
And approaching the paper boat.

202966d1-dc96-40e7-8b69-87fc1839ee76-0
00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.758
I can't. Oh, it's some kind of a
little ship, a different kind of

202966d1-dc96-40e7-8b69-87fc1839ee76-1
00:26:01.758 --> 00:26:07.886
ship with amazing creatures like
horse like creatures and other

202966d1-dc96-40e7-8b69-87fc1839ee76-2
00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:13.917
creatures and the black capped
character from the beginning in

202966d1-dc96-40e7-8b69-87fc1839ee76-3
00:26:13.917 --> 00:26:16.790
a crows nest approaching them.

09be9db6-e5ac-4c09-8fb4-fc8fae841e99-0
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:27.669
Ohh my and now in this two page
spread there is a huge wave

09be9db6-e5ac-4c09-8fb4-fc8fae841e99-1
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:34.213
curling and about to crash over.
The paper boat is high up on the

09be9db6-e5ac-4c09-8fb4-fc8fae841e99-2
00:26:34.213 --> 00:26:40.559
inside of the wave. You can just
imagine that it's going to get

09be9db6-e5ac-4c09-8fb4-fc8fae841e99-3
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:46.310
tumbled and the blacks caped
character in his own vessel.

b5b7cea3-42c8-4f0a-9003-5dda3c51b4a3-0
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:54.450
Seems to be getting ready to
launch a paper airplane and has

b5b7cea3-42c8-4f0a-9003-5dda3c51b4a3-1
00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:00.184
some other helpers on board
constructing. Or there is a a

b5b7cea3-42c8-4f0a-9003-5dda3c51b4a3-2
00:27:00.184 --> 00:27:06.017
kite and I don't know if it's
being constructed or if it's

b5b7cea3-42c8-4f0a-9003-5dda3c51b4a3-3
00:27:06.017 --> 00:27:06.710
broken.

5b90fc7a-0c10-4fd3-ae4a-4043fe0e2d8c-0
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.908
It's open in the center and
there is a cat walking on a

5b90fc7a-0c10-4fd3-ae4a-4043fe0e2d8c-1
00:27:11.908 --> 00:27:12.300
line.

a87c1fe9-be25-4971-9e44-e5f6e2afe9f7-0
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:19.409
And some other fantastic
creatures. And I think I see on

a87c1fe9-be25-4971-9e44-e5f6e2afe9f7-1
00:27:19.409 --> 00:27:25.555
this contraption of a sailing
vessel, the creature in the

a87c1fe9-be25-4971-9e44-e5f6e2afe9f7-2
00:27:25.555 --> 00:27:28.839
diving suit is safely on board.

22722767-fe53-413b-bd8d-73f697eaf18d-0
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:30.690
OK.

6668b54c-736d-4c42-9afd-d8226de57ab6-0
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:39.566
The next two page spread we see
an expanse of the ocean and the

6668b54c-736d-4c42-9afd-d8226de57ab6-1
00:27:39.566 --> 00:27:45.946
clouds breaking and a huge bolt
of lightning coming down. The

6668b54c-736d-4c42-9afd-d8226de57ab6-2
00:27:45.946 --> 00:27:51.297
paper boat is there in the
foreground and the paper

6668b54c-736d-4c42-9afd-d8226de57ab6-3
00:27:51.297 --> 00:27:53.870
airplane is swooshing by.

0ab79eb0-a46a-4ac8-89c0-cee0fee02603-0
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.150
Ohh.

4d3f7378-a908-417b-b10b-4db3d87a1bd0-0
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.130
Now we have two pages, with the
first with the paper boat.

c746229f-65eb-43c6-acc5-3363b2a354e9-0
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.991
Surrounded by coils of a sea
serpent, looping up and over and

c746229f-65eb-43c6-acc5-3363b2a354e9-1
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:17.808
up and over and up and over,
countless times in the ocean.

c746229f-65eb-43c6-acc5-3363b2a354e9-2
00:28:17.808 --> 00:28:22.788
And then on the second page, the
head of the sea serpent has

c746229f-65eb-43c6-acc5-3363b2a354e9-3
00:28:22.788 --> 00:28:27.850
bitten the paper boat and is
holding it in its jaws above the

c746229f-65eb-43c6-acc5-3363b2a354e9-4
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:28.340
water.

a15e8fbb-dd41-41de-a293-ae4e902402fc-0
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.526
Ohh and now we're in the midst
of all the coils of the sea

a15e8fbb-dd41-41de-a293-ae4e902402fc-1
00:28:35.526 --> 00:28:40.003
serpent. And the sea serpent has
put the paper boat back on the

a15e8fbb-dd41-41de-a293-ae4e902402fc-2
00:28:40.003 --> 00:28:44.270
water underneath the coils and
is looking at the paper boat.

9b90c457-21a8-4186-b949-369e175ff3ee-0
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.440
And outside of the coils are a
couple of other sea creatures.

014ed4b4-960e-4308-b2af-8b8ac9915c9b-0
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:55.604
One with a very long sawtooth
nose and the other with the

014ed4b4-960e-4308-b2af-8b8ac9915c9b-1
00:28:55.604 --> 00:28:59.660
Unicorn horn, and they all have
glowing eyes.

480aa920-a18a-4b3b-9791-98b6b682dc83-0
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.770
And the next two page spread.

8e59d736-39db-48bf-8151-5cc160cb280f-0
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.090
The two other creatures.

98294ce3-92d5-479a-9ccf-f10f6f7e6564-0
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:14.420
are close to the paper boat and
there one of them is.

15cff3a3-dc5f-49d0-8d20-8805e6ecc509-0
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:21.624
Spewing out a waterfall from 2
nostrils, pouring water into the

15cff3a3-dc5f-49d0-8d20-8805e6ecc509-1
00:29:21.624 --> 00:29:25.400
paper boat while the other sea
creature.

d051d1d2-75c5-4f6b-a031-5858e6c7a33a-0
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:33.003
With the toothy nose, sawtooth
nose is looking on and to the

d051d1d2-75c5-4f6b-a031-5858e6c7a33a-1
00:29:33.003 --> 00:29:38.352
right it looks like a little
spit of dry land with some trash

d051d1d2-75c5-4f6b-a031-5858e6c7a33a-2
00:29:38.352 --> 00:29:43.530
on it, a boat and some bottle
and crumpled paper and a can.

599d4594-725e-42bc-8d4c-3441edf86e2c-0
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:50.495
And some other things. And a
fish person standing up on legs

599d4594-725e-42bc-8d4c-3441edf86e2c-1
00:29:50.495 --> 00:29:53.010
with striped swim trunks.

80d51e52-f1ff-44c6-bfe9-38e80dce1520-0
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.810
Ohh this next two page spread.

112132d1-7fb9-42de-ae56-a155de71a055-0
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.440
Was filled with jellyfish.

39e8b7b5-16bb-4cca-acd1-52d1738ace17-0
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.838
Lots and lots of them
surrounding the paper boat,

39e8b7b5-16bb-4cca-acd1-52d1738ace17-1
00:30:11.838 --> 00:30:15.880
which looks like it may have is
sinking into the water.

8a701dfc-740c-4277-99e4-acc6eb1d320b-0
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.320
And the next two page spread.

ca602b01-a51e-4578-8712-32256db4cc6f-0
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.270
A school of fish.

3677dc4a-62cf-4a94-ab69-3511ce1b4cbe-0
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.441
Seems to be swimming away with
the paper boat, and there's

3677dc4a-62cf-4a94-ab69-3511ce1b4cbe-1
00:30:33.441 --> 00:30:37.905
another deep sea creature
beneath them with dark glowing

3677dc4a-62cf-4a94-ab69-3511ce1b4cbe-2
00:30:37.905 --> 00:30:42.370
eyes and then off to the right.
It looks kind of like a.

b813177e-ef46-4c65-80c6-a5bb00de0a37-0
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.804
An octopus is now playing with
the paper boat. All of this is

b813177e-ef46-4c65-80c6-a5bb00de0a37-1
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:50.870
underwater.

4c02da14-d47a-4da4-b73e-ef23e6770bc4-0
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.060
Oh, and now?

21fc5fd5-d332-4b28-9bca-4f007dff1021-0
00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.319
The next page has the paper boat
on the bottom of the ocean with

21fc5fd5-d332-4b28-9bca-4f007dff1021-1
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:08.580
some many legged slug like sea
creatures with tentacles.

6fadd196-56f5-4123-80a9-5bf35d3cd634-0
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:16.376
Climbing in and over and around
it, and there's light shining

6fadd196-56f5-4123-80a9-5bf35d3cd634-1
00:31:16.376 --> 00:31:22.932
down from above. And then the
next page we see that the paper

6fadd196-56f5-4123-80a9-5bf35d3cd634-2
00:31:22.932 --> 00:31:29.065
boat is on the nose of a sunken
submarine with a headlamp

6fadd196-56f5-4123-80a9-5bf35d3cd634-3
00:31:29.065 --> 00:31:35.198
shining up, and there are all
kinds of deep sea creatures

6fadd196-56f5-4123-80a9-5bf35d3cd634-4
00:31:35.198 --> 00:31:38.900
swimming around nearby with
light.

0eefceea-d2e1-4d4e-825b-b676644e810d-0
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.180
Coming out of their eyes.

d96c80cd-cc15-4261-acf6-0451a9d92974-0
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.020
And on the next page.

497f9564-0725-475c-9483-cd992ae70e87-0
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:52.800
The submarine has risen to the
surface of the water, the paper

497f9564-0725-475c-9483-cd992ae70e87-1
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.557
boat is on its nose above water,
and water is pouring out of the

497f9564-0725-475c-9483-cd992ae70e87-2
00:31:57.557 --> 00:32:01.289
paper boat back into the water
and underneath the.

a81221e3-4abd-49ea-95b5-836be8ab0f28-0
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:08.193
Submarine are fishes and then
the next picture is of another

a81221e3-4abd-49ea-95b5-836be8ab0f28-1
00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:11.000
sea vessel with a propeller.

961bedbd-7173-4a24-bbea-f4492028e67f-0
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:18.307
Not the same as the submarine,
and there is a huge squid with

961bedbd-7173-4a24-bbea-f4492028e67f-1
00:32:18.307 --> 00:32:22.460
tentacles wrapping around the
sea ship.

30760a2e-2002-4aa4-8e89-d88d3f5ff16f-0
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.430
And the paper boat is sailing
away from that.

9af622e6-0bf3-4670-99ff-df23aeef30a8-0
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:34.307
It's funny, this one tentacle of
the squid is holding a container

9af622e6-0bf3-4670-99ff-df23aeef30a8-1
00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:39.142
looks like ink, and there are a
couple of people, 4 people on

9af622e6-0bf3-4670-99ff-df23aeef30a8-2
00:32:39.142 --> 00:32:43.120
the vessel and a number of
seagulls flying around.

2d4c635d-d2ab-4652-9cbc-cd427e66d853-0
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.560
The next page is a two page
spread with some.

592aeb47-fe9b-4834-bfd5-1228e6da0043-0
00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.333
Sea lions playing with the paper
boat, balancing it on the nose

592aeb47-fe9b-4834-bfd5-1228e6da0043-1
00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:03.421
of one of the sea lions, and
more sea lions playing under the

592aeb47-fe9b-4834-bfd5-1228e6da0043-2
00:33:03.421 --> 00:33:08.428
water, making loops and swimming
around. And then we see the

592aeb47-fe9b-4834-bfd5-1228e6da0043-3
00:33:08.428 --> 00:33:09.660
beginning of a.

bd580812-192a-4bd7-9389-992b4a50be55-0
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:15.339
A forest of sea kelp and some
fishes swimming in and out of

bd580812-192a-4bd7-9389-992b4a50be55-1
00:33:15.339 --> 00:33:16.360
the sea kelp.

0c0bd314-ca79-4c38-aa71-d47de70decec-0
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:25.477
And now this paper boat is
sailing over the sea kelp, and

0c0bd314-ca79-4c38-aa71-d47de70decec-1
00:33:25.477 --> 00:33:31.721
we see more of the creatures
within the sea kelp, everything

0c0bd314-ca79-4c38-aa71-d47de70decec-2
00:33:31.721 --> 00:33:34.690
from strange fishes and more.

282eab34-521c-4f72-b0b7-034cf1d23080-0
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.436
I'm blanking on the name
Jellyfishes and and there's a

282eab34-521c-4f72-b0b7-034cf1d23080-1
00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:49.556
person in a dive suit under the
water inside a clamshell that

282eab34-521c-4f72-b0b7-034cf1d23080-2
00:33:49.556 --> 00:33:56.561
they have cranked open and is
pulling out the Pearl from the

282eab34-521c-4f72-b0b7-034cf1d23080-3
00:33:56.561 --> 00:33:57.710
clamshell.

b424d401-b76a-42d0-afbd-49bd81515ff5-0
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.360
The next two pages there's a sea
buoy.

60aa9353-7282-4e8d-a740-8d90d99f0146-0
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:13.544
That the paper boat is sailing
past and all around the sea buoy

60aa9353-7282-4e8d-a740-8d90d99f0146-1
00:34:13.544 --> 00:34:19.305
are strange sea creatures and a
couple of seagulls, and the

60aa9353-7282-4e8d-a740-8d90d99f0146-2
00:34:19.305 --> 00:34:25.258
diving character is riding on
top of a little boat of its own

60aa9353-7282-4e8d-a740-8d90d99f0146-3
00:34:25.258 --> 00:34:31.115
and the next picture the paper
boat is sailing past a little

60aa9353-7282-4e8d-a740-8d90d99f0146-4
00:34:31.115 --> 00:34:36.395
jut of land with a big
lighthouse on it and off in the

60aa9353-7282-4e8d-a740-8d90d99f0146-5
00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:37.260
distance.

998ea3a0-31d1-4746-81af-7f0cc3c2d325-0
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:41.106
You see a couple of big cruise
ships and a smaller little

998ea3a0-31d1-4746-81af-7f0cc3c2d325-1
00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:42.930
sailing vessel and a person.

07b51211-9387-433d-bdee-a717a2df2f6e-0
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.050
In the foreground of the
lighthouses.

0e73cecd-4073-47f6-a399-78bf40d861f3-0
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:50.990
Ohh.

321f1fec-67c1-406d-b1b6-09ecdb6b3916-0
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.480
On this two page spread.

ea203823-b022-4276-a8eb-a1df34b91897-0
00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:02.986
The paper boat is sailing past a
large constructed pier. It's a

ea203823-b022-4276-a8eb-a1df34b91897-1
00:35:02.986 --> 00:35:06.820
beautiful latticework
construction.

764f7afb-2996-44bd-a9c3-d95b780a7775-0
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.218
With a long long like bridge
extension out to a round area

764f7afb-2996-44bd-a9c3-d95b780a7775-1
00:35:14.218 --> 00:35:14.970
with a.

5e2c6f30-ac29-44b1-b9bb-991f67710322-0
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:22.359
Outdoor structure comet I I can
imagine a carousel or something

5e2c6f30-ac29-44b1-b9bb-991f67710322-1
00:35:22.359 --> 00:35:27.389
inside and I see faint images of
people walking around.

5e2c6f30-ac29-44b1-b9bb-991f67710322-2
00:35:27.389 --> 00:35:32.599
Underneath in the water there
are fishes and seaweed, and

5e2c6f30-ac29-44b1-b9bb-991f67710322-3
00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:37.810
often the distance is 1 big
sailing vessel, and nearer to

5e2c6f30-ac29-44b1-b9bb-991f67710322-4
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:43.200
the paper boat a couple of
sailboats, another big sailboat.

b704f90c-1f68-440a-8ccc-e0ffe31cf850-0
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:47.800
Yep. And then the next two page
spread.

7519f9c2-2a90-4b13-919c-0c247fa4b59e-0
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.280
Ah, it's taken up.

0a2a6e04-0ba6-4d9f-9b62-b26c2f6bea3e-0
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.580
With the side of a very big.

8e1edb89-0726-498a-9252-a7284d2d24e4-0
00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.242
Cruise ship with an anchor
that's hauled in and a small

8e1edb89-0726-498a-9252-a7284d2d24e4-1
00:36:02.242 --> 00:36:07.688
little boat next to it, and a
little sailboat. And the tiny

8e1edb89-0726-498a-9252-a7284d2d24e4-2
00:36:07.688 --> 00:36:13.224
paper boat is riding on the
little wave that the prow of the

8e1edb89-0726-498a-9252-a7284d2d24e4-3
00:36:13.224 --> 00:36:18.852
big cruise ship is making in the
water. And I see a submarine

8e1edb89-0726-498a-9252-a7284d2d24e4-4
00:36:18.852 --> 00:36:24.570
underneath the water and in the
distance, domes and towers of.

4d44fad4-b403-465f-a8aa-8046623d6d5c-0
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.080
A city.

2f433b8e-4ca6-4a79-8507-d9f88165652c-0
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.070
Ohh.

e7e6ba4f-d892-4e41-bb8a-ec477a61fdcc-0
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.430
Now.

9fb7ed7c-5054-419e-adf9-107bc3d033b8-0
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:40.424
We have two pages, one with a
whale magnificently equipped

9fb7ed7c-5054-419e-adf9-107bc3d033b8-1
00:36:40.424 --> 00:36:45.660
with some kind of tank strapped
on to its back.

d1f0c226-6722-47b2-8748-a2cf702c0ef7-0
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.472
And a shower keeping its head
wet because the whale is almost

d1f0c226-6722-47b2-8748-a2cf702c0ef7-1
00:36:52.472 --> 00:36:57.660
completely rearing up out of the
water with a couple of sea legs.

87bc582a-d95f-4b0f-b7f1-893da7710534-0
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.329
On a seawall and there is a
little tiny boat with three

87bc582a-d95f-4b0f-b7f1-893da7710534-1
00:37:03.329 --> 00:37:05.970
people in it and a little out.

790c13cc-d7a8-4e68-83c7-4fc7a87c4799-0
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:11.745
They have little motor on it and
a sea buoy and a slightly bigger

790c13cc-d7a8-4e68-83c7-4fc7a87c4799-1
00:37:11.745 --> 00:37:13.690
fishing boat and seagulls.

b9071bbc-41ef-45aa-8192-6f9757d94ede-0
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:20.629
And then the next page, we're
closer to the seawall and lots

b9071bbc-41ef-45aa-8192-6f9757d94ede-1
00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:25.609
of people on the side, you know,
to greet and wave on the big

b9071bbc-41ef-45aa-8192-6f9757d94ede-2
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:30.830
sailing vessels, and the little
paper boat is in the foreground,

b9071bbc-41ef-45aa-8192-6f9757d94ede-3
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.240
just sailing past all of this.

dc42797a-0ecb-4e5b-912c-9986a946e71f-0
00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:42.194
The paper boat continues sailing
past this. It's become much more

dc42797a-0ecb-4e5b-912c-9986a946e71f-1
00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:43.130
industrial.

57101ebf-9692-4122-81ce-6285abf617af-0
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.860
By the water.

0de178ba-a2d4-4f9b-a31c-eb828cc005b9-0
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.530
I don't know if it's factories,
but there are.

aa14068b-3456-4a0c-9b2f-5ca091998530-0
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.110
Ohh.

abc2c573-1085-4182-9ea1-616ee690444f-0
00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:03.310
I'm blanking on the name the
cranes. Big truck construction

abc2c573-1085-4182-9ea1-616ee690444f-1
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.020
cranes that are offloading.

4f475823-13a1-461b-8594-32153c59a54c-0
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.386
Cargo from the big ships and in
the foreground you can see the

4f475823-13a1-461b-8594-32153c59a54c-1
00:38:12.386 --> 00:38:17.412
little paper boat and then a
small little sailboat with two

4f475823-13a1-461b-8594-32153c59a54c-2
00:38:17.412 --> 00:38:22.438
people in it. Another little
boat and the next picture is a

4f475823-13a1-461b-8594-32153c59a54c-3
00:38:22.438 --> 00:38:27.631
fantastic sea creature, a much
larger sea horse type with the

4f475823-13a1-461b-8594-32153c59a54c-4
00:38:27.631 --> 00:38:28.720
curling tail.

4229fd9a-1db9-463a-8165-4fadde40608b-0
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:36.765
But I think it's a construction
because it has a divers head

4229fd9a-1db9-463a-8165-4fadde40608b-1
00:38:36.765 --> 00:38:42.792
construction on the top and a
person is inside. It's all glass

4229fd9a-1db9-463a-8165-4fadde40608b-2
00:38:42.792 --> 00:38:45.280
in the head and there's a.

5905db38-0ff9-40a6-9bd0-a95020bb0e73-0
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.150
It's.

9851acc4-e7d0-478a-8792-2e5522e539bb-0
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:53.120
Steering column inside and
there.

8c22a8dd-cea7-4dce-9411-42851d73e86e-0
00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.355
There's a lot of construction,
lots of brickwork all around and

8c22a8dd-cea7-4dce-9411-42851d73e86e-1
00:39:00.355 --> 00:39:04.070
the bottom of the crane and a
couple of people at the base of

8c22a8dd-cea7-4dce-9411-42851d73e86e-2
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:04.670
the crane.

b501a2bf-feb3-47a5-a518-a06f8a88cddf-0
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.150
Ohh and now.

1f009d0c-a427-4f3a-85cc-e878855aa6d8-0
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.600
The paper boat.

a6f8ac0b-2eed-4814-8971-daa2734d0741-0
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.748
is sailing by and seeing the
crane pulling up a huge net with

a6f8ac0b-2eed-4814-8971-daa2734d0741-1
00:39:18.748 --> 00:39:24.230
one of the two of the underneath
sea creatures, the one with the.

40db16ce-f3cc-4d5e-b459-a45e56020349-0
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:29.791
Sawtooth, nosed another with the
Unicorn horns sticking out. And

40db16ce-f3cc-4d5e-b459-a45e56020349-1
00:39:29.791 --> 00:39:30.700
they're all.

e7f9208c-989a-48ac-b241-da6d36329f6c-0
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.540
Bundled up in the.

dda83927-0d38-41f3-b42b-1767acc0ebeb-0
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.620
Net coming up out of the water
and dripping water and.

f66b8c83-7e81-4dbc-929b-f73af207c8e7-0
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:45.214
There's a sea hand on a vessel
next door and buildings behind

f66b8c83-7e81-4dbc-929b-f73af207c8e7-1
00:39:45.214 --> 00:39:47.680
it. And the next picture.

2656d23f-bb40-4ed2-a19e-5196ca73f54b-0
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.210
Maybe it's um.

be6fd1dc-f2dc-47a7-a71c-7d9481456c66-0
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:56.260
A museum it has a name on it
says exploreatio and.

8f6488d5-b472-4d54-b1fd-fbc0debc53b2-0
00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.164
Paper boat is coming up to some
steps on the seawall and there's

8f6488d5-b472-4d54-b1fd-fbc0debc53b2-1
00:40:01.164 --> 00:40:04.750
a person coming down the steps
and there are some seabirds.

05b8ed6d-5bd3-4459-a86d-20cecfed832a-0
00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:13.760
Ohh, and now we're up, looking
down on the city.

d9c8e0e9-e0da-4d37-a2a4-902021cde589-0
00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:20.377
It appears to be night time with
Windows lit up, and in the

d9c8e0e9-e0da-4d37-a2a4-902021cde589-1
00:40:20.377 --> 00:40:26.334
foreground is the strange fish
person with the striped swim

d9c8e0e9-e0da-4d37-a2a4-902021cde589-2
00:40:26.334 --> 00:40:27.030
trunks.

fd8b7ce1-004f-47b7-9c3a-d7a0173aedee-0
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.510
With um.

7fd3c9eb-da30-4748-a532-f9f7b4b44acc-0
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.700
Some kind of contraption
strapped onto its body.

90c8d772-e106-4bda-a050-2d6149f37180-0
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.214
Like a whirly gig. Multiple
whirly gigs to help it fly, and

90c8d772-e106-4bda-a050-2d6149f37180-1
00:40:42.214 --> 00:40:44.110
it's stepping off the top.

ec316c56-118d-4200-ae14-f6572241b063-0
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:50.200
Of a tower as if it's hoping to
fly, and down below is the

ec316c56-118d-4200-ae14-f6572241b063-1
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.421
stream or river, with the little
paper boat and another boat

ec316c56-118d-4200-ae14-f6572241b063-2
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:56.620
continuing on.

daa732e4-2bc4-4a7a-b5b1-29f5ef3cb596-0
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.660
Ohh.

4384b1b6-b304-47bd-ad4b-b995cf55898a-0
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:07.893
And here we have a picture of
the paper boat close to the

4384b1b6-b304-47bd-ad4b-b995cf55898a-1
00:41:07.893 --> 00:41:13.240
steps in the sea wall and the
person in the diving outfit is

4384b1b6-b304-47bd-ad4b-b995cf55898a-2
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.236
there, and some other characters
that look like carnival

4384b1b6-b304-47bd-ad4b-b995cf55898a-3
00:41:18.236 --> 00:41:23.758
creatures and other horse like
and deer like creatures walking

4384b1b6-b304-47bd-ad4b-b995cf55898a-4
00:41:23.758 --> 00:41:28.666
up and down the stairs. Oh, and
there's the black Caped

4384b1b6-b304-47bd-ad4b-b995cf55898a-5
00:41:28.666 --> 00:41:30.419
character and a cat.

e8c86bbc-0dd8-48e8-ae22-1b4c13697e18-0
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:36.958
And then the next picture, we
still have lots of the the brick

e8c86bbc-0dd8-48e8-ae22-1b4c13697e18-1
00:41:36.958 --> 00:41:42.246
or stone constructed seawall and
arches, and it's like a canal

e8c86bbc-0dd8-48e8-ae22-1b4c13697e18-2
00:41:42.246 --> 00:41:45.940
that the paper boat continues to
sail down.

c8220a9b-0e7d-4f3a-8e7a-1dffc1407d78-0
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:52.010
And here.

cd2c8eeb-3e31-496f-bf22-7bd3e2179085-0
00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:00.360
The sail paper boat has exited
from the tunnel. The constructed

cd2c8eeb-3e31-496f-bf22-7bd3e2179085-1
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.701
tunnel and there are some fishes
with their heads sticking out of

cd2c8eeb-3e31-496f-bf22-7bd3e2179085-2
00:42:05.701 --> 00:42:08.130
the water gawking at the boat.

3d1e4661-04f1-4969-aad1-969a6697a978-0
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:13.221
And there are a couple of more
boats on either side of the

3d1e4661-04f1-4969-aad1-969a6697a978-1
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:13.650
canal.

1fe228a3-b92d-4582-9543-57b7625997a2-0
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.836
And you see some trees and a
couple of buildings and Night

1fe228a3-b92d-4582-9543-57b7625997a2-1
00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:19.360
Lights.

67b74269-3a74-4022-9ad1-95c1ffd15ffe-0
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.980
Oh.

efb57252-dcf5-4312-be11-a27afe9aa9d8-0
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.236
And now the paper boat is
approaching a small house

efb57252-dcf5-4312-be11-a27afe9aa9d8-1
00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:36.191
illuminated by a street light,
surrounded by trees, and there

efb57252-dcf5-4312-be11-a27afe9aa9d8-2
00:42:36.191 --> 00:42:37.869
are stars in the sky.

552f47b8-1460-40f6-ae83-87b5196dee9d-0
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.820
And the next page has six
panels.

bb678c3d-a590-43ac-a44a-8178cb8b8f9b-0
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.590
Of the boat.

1af17cf7-da27-4e13-be1b-292a03547b5a-0
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.503
Coming right up to the seawall
and there's a shadow of a

1af17cf7-da27-4e13-be1b-292a03547b5a-1
00:42:48.503 --> 00:42:48.920
person.

dfcc697e-03f1-46f2-9a84-a127dcd29d3f-0
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.530
That becomes more apparent in
the next picture.

98ac0c82-cfe2-478a-96b5-e1cde44b9cd8-0
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.355
And the person has, you know,
stars and stripes and dots

98ac0c82-cfe2-478a-96b5-e1cde44b9cd8-1
00:42:58.355 --> 00:43:02.330
decorating his body and he
climbs out of it.

67923df8-a346-47df-b44e-ac88d5e1b46a-0
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.710
He climbs out of the set the
paper boat.

1c4cd48f-ddde-4c72-873d-9773326b3e0c-0
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.199
And is now taking a couple of
steps up the stairs and turns

1c4cd48f-ddde-4c72-873d-9773326b3e0c-1
00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:12.250
and looks back at the paper
boat.

f162b9bf-a013-4d2d-b785-5d8040f8a0f6-0
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.500
And you can't tell if the paper
boat is disappearing or it's

f162b9bf-a013-4d2d-b785-5d8040f8a0f6-1
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.430
just getting dark.

d08b6ab0-e80e-4dfd-9d12-80d557667aff-0
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.071
#END_wanderer And then this
person is walking up the stairs,

d08b6ab0-e80e-4dfd-9d12-80d557667aff-1
00:43:23.071 --> 00:43:27.744
and at the top of the stairs I
can see two feet. And in the

d08b6ab0-e80e-4dfd-9d12-80d557667aff-2
00:43:27.744 --> 00:43:32.417
final panel where at the top of
the stairs you just see the

d08b6ab0-e80e-4dfd-9d12-80d557667aff-3
00:43:32.417 --> 00:43:34.910
Stonewall and two pairs of feet.

6abf5b7d-300a-464d-b934-ad374f1a2bab-0
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.480
{Alright, so that was the
story.}

e041b68d-0bbc-4562-a0dc-37eeec92f0aa-0
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.320
{Um, wow. So moving on.}

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-0
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:49.066
{There are two types of pictures
that you will see. The second

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-1
00:43:49.066 --> 00:43:53.734
type is is a complex scene. Hmm,
imagine you are again telling it

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-2
00:43:53.734 --> 00:43:57.695
to someone who cannot see the
picture. Describe what is

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-3
00:43:57.695 --> 00:44:02.010
happening and what you see.
Please try to take around 3 to 5

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-4
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:06.395
minutes to describe it on the
scene can be really crowded and

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-5
00:44:06.395 --> 00:44:10.993
it's OK to focus in one area at
a time. OK, so this will just be

5822ffbe-f3e5-417a-956f-7eac8513e7d4-6
00:44:10.993 --> 00:44:14.530
like one picture and I can spend
3 to 5 minutes.}

1d3cbd85-6b50-4fac-95c1-fc51f12f1586-0
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.430
{In this one picture, yes, OK.}

d43bd7d3-292f-4021-856c-8f3fb452c186-0
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:22.960
{Ohh.}

257abfa7-439c-4ccd-82a2-28a94bfb3244-0
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.610
{This looks like a page out of a
where's Waldo book.}

f380480e-37cb-4bc6-bd26-6986f1159c4b-0
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.160
#START_airport In fact, in this
two page spread, in the upper

f380480e-37cb-4bc6-bd26-6986f1159c4b-1
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.850
left hand corner is a postcard
with a stamp with Waldo's

f380480e-37cb-4bc6-bd26-6986f1159c4b-2
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.730
smiling bespectacled face and
his.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:49.217
It's classic little Beanie hat
with a red band and a white area

715a21ac-3995-4b14-a498-b20cc02b1a0a-1
00:44:49.217 --> 00:44:54.289
on it, and then a red little
tufty bobble on top and it's

715a21ac-3995-4b14-a498-b20cc02b1a0a-2
00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:59.449
postage marked where's Waldo
Airport, and it reads it's me

715a21ac-3995-4b14-a498-b20cc02b1a0a-3
00:44:59.449 --> 00:45:04.871
again, Waldo. Folks, some very
strange things happened at the

715a21ac-3995-4b14-a498-b20cc02b1a0a-4
00:45:04.871 --> 00:45:10.556
airport this morning. Helicopter
chopped down all the flagpoles.

715a21ac-3995-4b14-a498-b20cc02b1a0a-5
00:45:10.556 --> 00:45:13.879
A smuggler was caught hiding
watches.

35195cb0-4b21-4b64-a67e-37ff529d0d08-0
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.926
Under his beard and a herd of
elephants was getting onto a

35195cb0-4b21-4b64-a67e-37ff529d0d08-1
00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:18.600
jumbo jet.

3b15c692-731f-4210-9109-251395cfdc80-0
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.980
Weird. Signed Waldo.

71a15814-c9c4-4b02-be6f-48077ebf6db3-0
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:28.122
Addressed to waldo folks under
the carpet, under the bed, down

71a15814-c9c4-4b02-be6f-48077ebf6db3-1
00:45:28.122 --> 00:45:28.640
under.

75bdc7fe-f9aa-4107-af90-77d95a4e8717-0
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.971
Now around this in the top right
half of the left hand page, yes,

75bdc7fe-f9aa-4107-af90-77d95a4e8717-1
00:45:36.971 --> 00:45:42.775
we're in an airport and you can
see the air control tower,

75bdc7fe-f9aa-4107-af90-77d95a4e8717-2
00:45:42.775 --> 00:45:48.873
although it's topped off with
what looks like a castle turret

75bdc7fe-f9aa-4107-af90-77d95a4e8717-3
00:45:48.873 --> 00:45:53.300
tower with a knight or two and a
Bishop and.

7cb1b942-03c6-4a79-a69d-d7f6ebdf54f9-0
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:59.223
Another person in a blue shirt
and maybe even an old time

7cb1b942-03c6-4a79-a69d-d7f6ebdf54f9-1
00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:04.223
sailing vessel with a sail on
it. And then there's a rocket

7cb1b942-03c6-4a79-a69d-d7f6ebdf54f9-2
00:46:04.223 --> 00:46:09.390
ship zooming by with a tail of
fire shooting off to the left.

fbbef385-300f-405b-91b3-30957e059496-0
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:14.580
And beyond that, to the left is
a jet plane.

ff7715cc-a5ee-42eb-b549-9b1cb45da10e-0
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.990
And beyond that, further to the
very left, is a flying saucer.

21bd5815-0cb6-4880-bc4e-ce16d3efc117-0
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:27.686
Underneath the flying saucer on
top of the airport roof, we see

21bd5815-0cb6-4880-bc4e-ce16d3efc117-1
00:46:27.686 --> 00:46:32.704
three people. It looks like a
man and a woman and a child. And

21bd5815-0cb6-4880-bc4e-ce16d3efc117-2
00:46:32.704 --> 00:46:33.660
then at the.

21200b33-98b7-4a8d-8717-752c4b25610f-0
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.830
Bottom on the.

238eb32b-6fe5-4e9e-aa3d-821ab7460540-0
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:42.502
Street level there's a bus with
many people lined up to get on

238eb32b-6fe5-4e9e-aa3d-821ab7460540-1
00:46:42.502 --> 00:46:47.614
board, and they're wearing all
kinds of different colored

238eb32b-6fe5-4e9e-aa3d-821ab7460540-2
00:46:47.614 --> 00:46:52.550
outfits, red and green and white
and stripes, blue and.

b41b031a-7e57-4cff-afcb-e5d761b40520-0
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.207
Different hair, and there's one
flight attendant observing the

b41b031a-7e57-4cff-afcb-e5d761b40520-1
00:46:59.207 --> 00:47:02.996
line getting on to the bus, and
another flight attendant

b41b031a-7e57-4cff-afcb-e5d761b40520-2
00:47:02.996 --> 00:47:06.320
greeting people at the door
getting onto the bus.

6d71e9eb-46b5-4119-8d26-745f62c122d6-0
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:12.989
Near the bus in the foreground
is a luggage moving vehicle with

6d71e9eb-46b5-4119-8d26-745f62c122d6-1
00:47:12.989 --> 00:47:15.520
lots of suitcases on a few.

9e12ba92-7f48-4f0a-aff2-683b588d40fc-0
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:17.250
Um.

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-0
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.920
Cars of the luggage mover and
one piece of luggage has fallen

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-1
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:29.550
off and opened up and stuff is
coming out of it. And a couple

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-2
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:34.329
of other pieces of luggage are
falling off and there's a man in

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-3
00:47:34.329 --> 00:47:38.436
a suit standing to the side
waving at the person who's

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-4
00:47:38.436 --> 00:47:42.992
driving. And the person who's
driving is looking back at the

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-5
00:47:42.992 --> 00:47:47.921
person waving and not looking at
where he's going and he has just

2f1a80d7-e12c-482b-9810-d50965bcb1a9-6
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:49.340
driven into a hose.

51046784-6120-4f17-85e8-858f9bca3aa0-0
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:55.193
On the ground and water is
spurting out and two other

51046784-6120-4f17-85e8-858f9bca3aa0-1
00:47:55.193 --> 00:48:01.753
people in blue work outfits are
making expressions with their

51046784-6120-4f17-85e8-858f9bca3aa0-2
00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:04.610
bodies and arms like Oh no.

dd76191f-eb31-4859-8909-f20bf53e9f07-0
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:11.957
Um, and then in front of them
all is a green truck with a hose

dd76191f-eb31-4859-8909-f20bf53e9f07-1
00:48:11.957 --> 00:48:17.681
that's disconnected and there's
a pool of water behind the green

dd76191f-eb31-4859-8909-f20bf53e9f07-2
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:21.820
truck. And on top of the green
truck is Waldo.

252b631f-85a6-483e-acb9-4832bd5acc07-0
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.867
Yeah, and at the back of the
green truck is another worker

252b631f-85a6-483e-acb9-4832bd5acc07-1
00:48:26.867 --> 00:48:30.687
and a blue suit reading a piece
of paper. I looks like he's

252b631f-85a6-483e-acb9-4832bd5acc07-2
00:48:30.687 --> 00:48:34.190
trying to read instructions and
figure out what to do.

d3f2902d-40d8-4ce5-83ce-cc79cb7e8f9c-0
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:40.971
And beyond the green track are
few more workers in blue suits

d3f2902d-40d8-4ce5-83ce-cc79cb7e8f9c-1
00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:46.403
and yellow vests for better
visibility. A couple of them are

d3f2902d-40d8-4ce5-83ce-cc79cb7e8f9c-2
00:48:46.403 --> 00:48:49.520
playing what looks like ping
pong.

9391ccb9-1da0-4daf-bda1-b2162c02286e-0
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.830
We're going to move further down
on the left hand page.

a4acd5c8-371a-48bb-ade3-98015534cacc-0
00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.862
Again, close to the luggage
mover is a red truck that looks

a4acd5c8-371a-48bb-ade3-98015534cacc-1
00:49:01.862 --> 00:49:07.870
like a tank truck and the hose
that the luggage mover ran into

a4acd5c8-371a-48bb-ade3-98015534cacc-2
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:13.879
is coming out of the red truck.
Next to the red truck we see a

a4acd5c8-371a-48bb-ade3-98015534cacc-3
00:49:13.879 --> 00:49:20.078
big airplane with people getting
off, coming down the stairs and

a4acd5c8-371a-48bb-ade3-98015534cacc-4
00:49:20.078 --> 00:49:25.610
walking across the tarmac. There
are blue suited workers.

21c1d956-87b6-4ee2-a54f-25e24920bb15-0
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:30.260
On the wing and on top of the
plane doing something.

42753b73-95df-444a-a026-b447ac12a257-0
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:36.615
And at the back of the plane,
there's a big thing being

42753b73-95df-444a-a026-b447ac12a257-1
00:49:36.615 --> 00:49:40.299
offloaded, just a big
rectangular thing being

42753b73-95df-444a-a026-b447ac12a257-2
00:49:40.299 --> 00:49:41.100
offloaded.

5f355896-94d7-491b-9cbd-8053be73ab2f-0
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.934
Beyond the back of the plane we
are now moved into the right

5f355896-94d7-491b-9cbd-8053be73ab2f-1
00:49:47.934 --> 00:49:54.010
hand page is a fire truck racing
by and spraying water at people.

df4b8e07-c18b-42e3-8705-5035e58cbd19-0
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.720
Um, and some people looks like
it. They've either fallen off

df4b8e07-c18b-42e3-8705-5035e58cbd19-1
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.310
the fire truck or they were run
over by the fire truck.

7f9b68f4-4e35-440c-baa6-90ea201f498c-0
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.760
Beyond the fire truck, moving
further to the right.

8bc5f7f3-faaa-4378-b475-6651aeb82b36-0
00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.950
Is a biplane.

5527c1ea-4aab-4428-8c1f-61e936703ecc-0
00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.380
It has the ace of spades in the
cockpit.

b439464a-141c-436f-b322-f67d3b8bdd42-0
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:17.600
Size of a person.

53b35359-fb49-4d2c-9839-1ff7d35eddcd-0
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.620
And beyond that

b6cea5fb-8ccc-4042-9070-d3549c989ed1-0
00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.320
Is another.

7cae26e3-1a2f-4ebe-8ca1-b51e462a77ce-0
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:23.940
Blue.

a9a62fa5-63bf-492b-b1ee-92c62f4996a4-0
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.444
Truck going over to another
parked airplane whose nose is

a9a62fa5-63bf-492b-b1ee-92c62f4996a4-1
00:50:29.444 --> 00:50:33.876
open and it looks like it's
being serviced on the inside by

a9a62fa5-63bf-492b-b1ee-92c62f4996a4-2
00:50:33.876 --> 00:50:38.235
a couple of blue uniformed
people, and there's yet another

a9a62fa5-63bf-492b-b1ee-92c62f4996a4-3
00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:38.900
airplane.

92891adc-1d42-41c4-be89-f23f169b4d64-0
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:45.696
Heading more toward the top of
the right page and above that

92891adc-1d42-41c4-be89-f23f169b4d64-1
00:50:45.696 --> 00:50:50.333
airplane on the ground, we have
a red and yellow striped air

92891adc-1d42-41c4-be89-f23f169b4d64-2
00:50:50.333 --> 00:50:51.550
balloon. That's.

94fd8eab-ee62-4974-aa0b-e86312ac7521-0
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:57.374
On the ground right now there is
a pink helicopter with the

94fd8eab-ee62-4974-aa0b-e86312ac7521-1
00:50:57.374 --> 00:50:59.770
rotors worrying, and it has.

b1d30c34-5018-4848-97db-a34f9b43f79a-0
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.835
A number of flags around it. Oh,
that's the helicopter that

b1d30c34-5018-4848-97db-a34f9b43f79a-1
00:51:04.835 --> 00:51:07.340
chopped down a bunch of flags.
There we go.

7b47e137-da0e-4ae5-a453-9f87a8fa3f5b-0
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.210
And then above it is a
dirigible.

1174aa84-4523-48e0-a2fe-639428f9c93c-0
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:15.600
And to the right left of the
dirigibles another biplane.

8d1dbac6-7794-42cb-8794-e0ec1f0276ba-0
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.766
And to the right of the
dirigible, it looks like the

8d1dbac6-7794-42cb-8794-e0ec1f0276ba-1
00:51:21.766 --> 00:51:26.227
Concorde airplane with that
sloped pointy note nose taking

8d1dbac6-7794-42cb-8794-e0ec1f0276ba-2
00:51:26.227 --> 00:51:26.530
off.

7d7640ec-ddc4-424b-816a-412979ca2420-0
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:28.450
Um.

03106b14-1f00-48d5-9373-38d83d4486b4-0
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:34.495
Further down on the right hand
page, below the fire truck

03106b14-1f00-48d5-9373-38d83d4486b4-1
00:51:34.495 --> 00:51:39.920
squirting water, we have more
luggage, movers and lot luggage

03106b14-1f00-48d5-9373-38d83d4486b4-2
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.470
getting offloaded and and tossed
from hand to hand.

010f618a-2df1-406b-b673-c148b0df9341-0
00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.883
There are a bunch of crates in
the foreground. There's a fork

010f618a-2df1-406b-b673-c148b0df9341-1
00:51:50.883 --> 00:51:54.896
truck carrying an oversized
fork. There are about four

010f618a-2df1-406b-b673-c148b0df9341-2
00:51:54.896 --> 00:51:58.836
workers huddled around the
crates, taking a break and

010f618a-2df1-406b-b673-c148b0df9341-3
00:51:58.836 --> 00:52:02.850
smoking. And you can see the
cigarettes and the smoke.

cf569fba-764f-4cd5-898c-37ac49cc00e3-0
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.338
Wafting above them, ones reading
a newspaper, one sitting down

cf569fba-764f-4cd5-898c-37ac49cc00e3-1
00:52:08.338 --> 00:52:12.125
and then off to their side. On
the right is perhaps a

cf569fba-764f-4cd5-898c-37ac49cc00e3-2
00:52:12.125 --> 00:52:16.262
supervising worker who has his
hands on his hips, and it's

cf569fba-764f-4cd5-898c-37ac49cc00e3-3
00:52:16.262 --> 00:52:20.190
looking disapprovingly at the
smoking, resting workers.

79b6212b-b286-47d0-b876-18402f67ec97-0
00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:26.796
Um ohh dear. And then all the
way to the right to the end of

79b6212b-b286-47d0-b876-18402f67ec97-1
00:52:26.796 --> 00:52:30.480
the page is part of another
airplane, the.

e10d7789-fa64-47f2-b93c-fad210dfa91b-0
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.020
Stairs.

9fa9c448-2c0a-41a2-ac1f-852c390462a5-0
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:37.848
For people to get on and off
weren't lined up with the exit

9fa9c448-2c0a-41a2-ac1f-852c390462a5-1
00:52:37.848 --> 00:52:41.648
hatch and people. The exit door
is open and people are walking

9fa9c448-2c0a-41a2-ac1f-852c390462a5-2
00:52:41.648 --> 00:52:43.820
out and then falling to the
ground.

73d75cec-15e6-47a0-96fd-8dcdd3e8c633-0
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:50.826
Um, at the very bottom of the
page, from the left to the right

73d75cec-15e6-47a0-96fd-8dcdd3e8c633-1
00:52:50.826 --> 00:52:55.781
side. It's like a cutaway. And
we're inside the airport.

73d75cec-15e6-47a0-96fd-8dcdd3e8c633-2
00:52:55.781 --> 00:53:00.824
There's red carpeting and some
windows and lots of people

73d75cec-15e6-47a0-96fd-8dcdd3e8c633-3
00:53:00.824 --> 00:53:06.040
moving across. Oh, there's the
luggage claim area with the.

3d68dd79-b475-4156-a220-b5850934a7fa-0
00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.778
Luggage moving along on the
belt. There's a person on the

3d68dd79-b475-4156-a220-b5850934a7fa-1
00:53:10.778 --> 00:53:14.204
luggage belt. People are finding
their luggage. People are

3d68dd79-b475-4156-a220-b5850934a7fa-2
00:53:14.204 --> 00:53:17.630
waiting for their luggage all
around the belt. The luggage

3d68dd79-b475-4156-a220-b5850934a7fa-3
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.850
looks really mangled.

fe8c46cb-c145-4e18-94bb-5da690b73e78-0
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.514
More people are walking through.
There's a perhaps an Information

fe8c46cb-c145-4e18-94bb-5da690b73e78-1
00:53:25.514 --> 00:53:30.229
Center or help center table in
the middle. Oh, they're the

fe8c46cb-c145-4e18-94bb-5da690b73e78-2
00:53:30.229 --> 00:53:34.864
police. They've captured the
person whose coat was filled

fe8c46cb-c145-4e18-94bb-5da690b73e78-3
00:53:34.864 --> 00:53:38.700
with wristwatches. He's coat is
held wide open.

6bbda4cb-724b-453c-bee2-04998397f769-0
00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.600
There's somebody else just to
the right of that.

17d9920c-1769-47dd-92ed-7bb67d57af8c-0
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:46.980
Like a spy looking like he's
trying to sneak away with a.

28795f19-f5da-49f1-a5c7-4670ac4489b6-0
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:52.046
Suitcase full of watches, but a
police officer is looking on

28795f19-f5da-49f1-a5c7-4670ac4489b6-1
00:53:52.046 --> 00:53:53.550
with a knowing smile.

cfb0fe0f-fb23-47c1-b122-082077cc000f-0
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:58.310
Um, and then just pass them.
There's another.

041eee28-d96b-49f1-bbab-14d0b7e9ccb3-0
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:02.520
Passenger with a very long
beard, long white going down to

041eee28-d96b-49f1-bbab-14d0b7e9ccb3-1
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.198
his knees, and a police officer
is lifting it up and displaying

041eee28-d96b-49f1-bbab-14d0b7e9ccb3-2
00:54:06.198 --> 00:54:08.210
more watches underneath his
beard.

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:14.254
And then we go past and there
are more people coming and going

fce65029-025b-4d41-a9d5-290e0e87e333-1
00:54:14.254 --> 00:54:17.350
with luggages and some flight
attendants.

79dd33b0-1be6-4d9d-b31a-448c6e4c4b1a-0
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.560
Um.

8d4567db-ce66-4c56-aa2a-5e7d2c8c5b8a-0
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:26.162
More chaos as people get their
baggage, complain about their

8d4567db-ce66-4c56-aa2a-5e7d2c8c5b8a-1
00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:26.910
baggage.

{OK, that was good. So now let's
take the 10 minute break. Ohh

00:54:35.931 --> 00:54:38.620
good. Get some water. Right.}

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:45.811
{So the next item, it's also a
complex scene. Again, take

00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:49.774
between three and five minutes
to describe what you see and

1081caf6-4685-46a0-8e67-3f505e0c871a-2
00:54:49.774 --> 00:54:51.030
what is happening.}

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:58.340
{Ohh.}

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.000
{It's more Waldo it is.}

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:05.950
{OK.}

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.160
{I forgot my glasses, OK.}

f758b777-82d5-400d-b2d1-9ff3fec4b7cd-0
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.650
#START_waldo-1 All right, all
right. We've got a two page

f758b777-82d5-400d-b2d1-9ff3fec4b7cd-1
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.383
spread here from where is Waldo?
And on the left hand side

f758b777-82d5-400d-b2d1-9ff3fec4b7cd-2
00:55:29.383 --> 00:55:32.800
there's a note from Waldo and
he's standing there all

f758b777-82d5-400d-b2d1-9ff3fec4b7cd-3
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.370
jauntily.

5c22eb61-3f95-48b1-97f4-87bfd83b11ae-0
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:39.970
Decked out for hiking in his red
and white striped top and cap

5c22eb61-3f95-48b1-97f4-87bfd83b11ae-1
00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:40.340
and.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.890
Gear hanging off of him and a
walking cane.

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-0
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:49.091
And this note says, hi friends,
my name is Waldo. I'm just

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-1
00:55:49.091 --> 00:55:53.704
setting off on a worldwide hike.
You can come too. All you have

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-2
00:55:53.704 --> 00:55:58.172
to do is find me. I've got all I
need. Walking stick, kettle,

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-3
00:55:58.172 --> 00:56:02.279
mallet, cup, backpack, sleeping
bag, binoculars, camera,

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-4
00:56:02.279 --> 00:56:06.603
snorkel, belt, bag and shovel.
I'm not traveling on my own.

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-5
00:56:06.603 --> 00:56:10.999
Wherever I go, there are lots of
other characters for you to

603fad08-8a2a-40b8-80c1-af21ddfb61e7-6
00:56:10.999 --> 00:56:11.360
spot.

df177430-722e-40a4-9287-534ca249daee-0
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:13.610
First fund woof.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.320
But all you can see is his tail,
Wanda.

c3d5ebfd-13b7-4843-898a-3ead7ab58246-0
00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.480
Wizard, White Beard and odlaw.

26537ca0-1877-4c33-a3ec-2f656c13d885-0
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:27.047
Then find 25 Waldo watchers
somewhere, each of whom appears

26537ca0-1877-4c33-a3ec-2f656c13d885-1
00:56:27.047 --> 00:56:31.746
only once. In my travels can you
find one other character who

26537ca0-1877-4c33-a3ec-2f656c13d885-2
00:56:31.746 --> 00:56:33.490
appears in every scene.

c7d8fecd-6291-473f-8e65-8a3fb9a875d7-0
00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:39.556
Also, in every scene can you
spot my key Woof spone? Wanda's

c7d8fecd-6291-473f-8e65-8a3fb9a875d7-1
00:56:39.556 --> 00:56:44.980
does camera wizard white Beer
scroll and odd laws binoculars?

6fe80361-4b58-4507-853c-15b4a7fb6ccf-0
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.890
Wow. What a search. Waldo.

baf69f8e-c49b-4975-ac75-6981898a4577-0
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.290
And then there are pictures of
all the different.

c628afad-05bb-4a20-a4c8-024fad8998dd-0
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.650
Things that he's asked us to
find in this picture.

72517b19-5ff3-400c-88c1-008b7afa0f38-0
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.690
We're in a.

4412709c-464c-49d9-be9c-cbea88888372-0
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:09.634
Downtown streetscape with
buildings and streets and people

4412709c-464c-49d9-be9c-cbea88888372-1
00:57:09.634 --> 00:57:12.130
and cars all around and.

45c76843-5d8a-413a-8513-be4ff069b910-0
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.350
As we get closer.

ae1c782e-6890-426c-8058-3b099a166fca-0
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.220
In the top left corner we see
what looks like a school.

5cc9dc43-7958-4527-aa0b-bc064ff943a9-0
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:23.944
Big Square building with a fence
and a little bit of a grassy

5cc9dc43-7958-4527-aa0b-bc064ff943a9-1
00:57:23.944 --> 00:57:27.506
inside area and a person
standing at the open gate door.

5cc9dc43-7958-4527-aa0b-bc064ff943a9-2
00:57:27.506 --> 00:57:31.130
And there are small people,
perhaps children, approaching

5cc9dc43-7958-4527-aa0b-bc064ff943a9-3
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.630
from both sides of the of the
sidewalk.

2519fbd7-79b9-44dd-bbb9-d1f6313136c8-0
00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.268
There's also a crossing guard at
the corner helping some children

2519fbd7-79b9-44dd-bbb9-d1f6313136c8-1
00:57:39.268 --> 00:57:43.022
cross the street, and there's a
blue car that's stopped and

2519fbd7-79b9-44dd-bbb9-d1f6313136c8-2
00:57:43.022 --> 00:57:46.838
waiting for them, but someone
else fell off of their bicycle

2519fbd7-79b9-44dd-bbb9-d1f6313136c8-3
00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:50.654
and there's another bicycle.
Perhaps they hit each other and

2519fbd7-79b9-44dd-bbb9-d1f6313136c8-4
00:57:50.654 --> 00:57:54.533
there are a couple of medical
people with white coats running

2519fbd7-79b9-44dd-bbb9-d1f6313136c8-5
00:57:54.533 --> 00:57:58.600
to help the people who fell off
their bicycles and an ambulance.

5afead19-f55f-4356-ae24-f23115ce0e19-0
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.810
And then there's a trash truck
that looks like.

10f68084-8d28-4114-a116-29d3caa760a0-0
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.540
That's all across the top of the
page and then going through the

10f68084-8d28-4114-a116-29d3caa760a0-1
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.970
middle section of the page.

19624f25-ef7c-446f-9677-6b4e9b3f2fba-0
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:14.010
Ohh, it looks like there's maybe
a fire truck.

44d76bdd-64dd-4f42-a28f-d52f5879ab73-0
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:18.030
With firemen on the roof of a
house.

f7c2a1d2-63ad-4363-aa3f-ec5fed3f4343-0
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.377
But it's covered up by Waldo's
notes, so I can't see a lot. And

f7c2a1d2-63ad-4363-aa3f-ec5fed3f4343-1
00:58:23.377 --> 00:58:25.120
then there's a big pink house.

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-0
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:30.139
With a red striped awning. Oh,
maybe it's a hotel because

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-1
00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:34.428
there's a fancy dressed man
outside with a suit and a red

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-2
00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:39.013
lapel outside the doors and a
big red carpet greeting people.

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-3
00:58:39.013 --> 00:58:43.672
And there's a man with a top hat
and a woman with a yellow hat

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-4
00:58:43.672 --> 00:58:48.109
and a dog on a leash and it
looks like a bell boy holding a

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-5
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:52.472
suitcase. So I think this big
pink building is a hotel and

7909ad69-b949-4766-8779-86be307f9e4d-6
00:58:52.472 --> 00:58:56.170
there are a few people on the
roof of this house.

9254bed9-b5c8-4a45-a387-0f2a1908216e-0
00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:01.459
Too There are two dormer windows
and people hanging out of both

9254bed9-b5c8-4a45-a387-0f2a1908216e-1
00:59:01.459 --> 00:59:03.090
of them, apparently.

2b6c760e-82a9-4cd6-bf68-f480fdd1141d-0
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:08.056
A pet on a leash has gotten away
and one person has even gone

2b6c760e-82a9-4cd6-bf68-f480fdd1141d-1
00:59:08.056 --> 00:59:11.754
outside the window and is
walking across or crouching

2b6c760e-82a9-4cd6-bf68-f480fdd1141d-2
00:59:11.754 --> 00:59:15.110
across the roof trying to catch
the escaped pet.

43939280-3ea4-4e20-a266-784933beebf0-0
00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:24.510
Continuing across oh, there is a
house with a green car parked.

4922045f-9c50-4d5c-b9fe-46b7970fc0f6-0
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.453
And a whole someone's going
through the trunk, pulling out

4922045f-9c50-4d5c-b9fe-46b7970fc0f6-1
00:59:31.453 --> 00:59:35.840
all kinds of junk and throwing
it all around, and now I see

4922045f-9c50-4d5c-b9fe-46b7970fc0f6-2
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.010
what looks like.

6b30d5dc-b717-44fd-86bf-480c102d98f9-0
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.645
Perhaps. Maybe it's a gas
station or a service station,

6b30d5dc-b717-44fd-86bf-480c102d98f9-1
00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:42.720
because it looks like there's a
gas pump.

5631d56b-f94b-47dc-9e14-ed0e4cc57b00-0
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:48.315
So perhaps that car it's not the
trunk, but it's the engine, and

5631d56b-f94b-47dc-9e14-ed0e4cc57b00-1
00:59:48.315 --> 00:59:52.622
it's hopefully getting fixed,
but it looks more taken apart

5631d56b-f94b-47dc-9e14-ed0e4cc57b00-2
00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:53.340
right now.

3279ea7b-b46d-4ccd-ad68-05db5fb57b73-0
00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:59.863
Yes, we're downtown. Next door
to the gas station is a shoe

3279ea7b-b46d-4ccd-ad68-05db5fb57b73-1
00:59:59.863 --> 01:00:04.347
shop with a sign about shoes
above the window, and then

3279ea7b-b46d-4ccd-ad68-05db5fb57b73-2
01:00:04.347 --> 01:00:07.790
people on the 2nd floor and
their windows.

89a845ee-25cd-4d47-94e3-63d810d8205b-0
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:13.735
Um, next door. I can't tell what
it is. Oh, people are gathered

89a845ee-25cd-4d47-94e3-63d810d8205b-1
01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:18.000
around the display window
looking, I think at a TV screen.

96fa7847-a299-444f-bcdc-b00c5dd57d3b-0
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:23.072
Back in the days when that's
what we did and then next to

96fa7847-a299-444f-bcdc-b00c5dd57d3b-1
01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:24.470
that is the fire truck.

3b5cc4a1-42b4-4c76-b18b-b6b04dae9e56-0
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.930
Fire Station with a fire truck.

3c0dbef6-e442-4c6a-b537-354e738b8b1d-0
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:28.300
Umm.

424a4906-3e21-469c-9e6f-c9e846cf7b55-0
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.240
I don't think it's going out. It
looks like it might be.

282ab7f2-41cc-4f3c-998c-7930b9fb229d-0
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:37.936
Getting things put together and
ready for its next excursion and

282ab7f2-41cc-4f3c-998c-7930b9fb229d-1
01:00:37.936 --> 01:00:42.189
the floor above it is a fireman
hanging in the window, just

282ab7f2-41cc-4f3c-998c-7930b9fb229d-2
01:00:42.189 --> 01:00:43.039
looking out.

6d4e758a-7c61-4c40-ad12-80e774fb7bc5-0
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.601
And then there's another
building with some people coming

6d4e758a-7c61-4c40-ad12-80e774fb7bc5-1
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:51.197
and going. It looks like it
might be a police station

6d4e758a-7c61-4c40-ad12-80e774fb7bc5-2
01:00:51.197 --> 01:00:55.391
because the blue suited men with
hats kind of look like police

6d4e758a-7c61-4c40-ad12-80e774fb7bc5-3
01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:59.719
officers. And then it looks like
there's a stripe shirted person

6d4e758a-7c61-4c40-ad12-80e774fb7bc5-4
01:00:59.719 --> 01:01:01.850
skulking and being taken inside.

0f2004dd-f7ec-4628-b7a1-7df985befcd7-0
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.790
Across the street from them,
also on the right hand side of

0f2004dd-f7ec-4628-b7a1-7df985befcd7-1
01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.320
the page, are more.

07abb217-057e-4089-94ed-6df784e6cda8-0
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:16.444
Shops, and perhaps the ground
floor level or all businesses in

07abb217-057e-4089-94ed-6df784e6cda8-1
01:01:16.444 --> 01:01:19.955
the second floor are people's
homes because the 2nd floor

07abb217-057e-4089-94ed-6df784e6cda8-2
01:01:19.955 --> 01:01:21.530
windows often have people.

667789ce-049b-4dc8-8ec2-2450b855e2c7-0
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.239
Outside. You know, in them
looking outside, talking to

667789ce-049b-4dc8-8ec2-2450b855e2c7-1
01:01:26.239 --> 01:01:29.929
people outside the windows,
watering flowers outside the

667789ce-049b-4dc8-8ec2-2450b855e2c7-2
01:01:29.929 --> 01:01:33.230
windows on top of the roof,
someone servicing the.

89dac9a6-94a6-4313-ad7c-70fde03e078c-0
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.848
Heating and ventilation units.
Oh and I see a perhaps a cat and

89dac9a6-94a6-4313-ad7c-70fde03e078c-1
01:01:39.848 --> 01:01:44.477
a dog on the roof as well, but
on the street level up a car has

89dac9a6-94a6-4313-ad7c-70fde03e078c-2
01:01:44.477 --> 01:01:48.745
rear-ended a little pickup
truck, a red car has rear-ended

89dac9a6-94a6-4313-ad7c-70fde03e078c-3
01:01:48.745 --> 01:01:52.939
a yellow pickup truck and
there's steam coming out. Looks

89dac9a6-94a6-4313-ad7c-70fde03e078c-4
01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:56.050
like the radiator got hurt and
two people.

17d9fa6e-1799-4f69-ad80-2b7804c9bddb-0
01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.078
Talking or yelling at each other
and gesturing and a police

17d9fa6e-1799-4f69-ad80-2b7804c9bddb-1
01:02:00.078 --> 01:02:01.910
officer running across the
street.

a829ae5a-a75f-4092-b159-52d777069f85-0
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:06.820
To help. And they're right
outside a bookstore.

92df7854-f210-43f0-8372-821b8b38aa8b-0
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.268
And then there's another store,
a shop next door that I think is

92df7854-f210-43f0-8372-821b8b38aa8b-1
01:02:12.268 --> 01:02:16.457
a Barber shop or salon, because
people go in with big bushy hair

92df7854-f210-43f0-8372-821b8b38aa8b-2
01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:19.100
and they come out looking nice
and neat.

a2975239-f8da-453d-ba5c-defcfc6e651d-0
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.280
And then around the corner.

710645dd-66c6-4c1e-bbd4-baa03af29da9-0
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.662
Is a little restaurant with a
red and white awning and people

710645dd-66c6-4c1e-bbd4-baa03af29da9-1
01:02:27.662 --> 01:02:32.389
sitting at a table outside and a
waiter pouring to overflowing

710645dd-66c6-4c1e-bbd4-baa03af29da9-2
01:02:32.389 --> 01:02:33.590
some red liquid.

7246ea4c-778f-469c-8648-3d776f2f5fbc-0
01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:38.160
Um, and a couple of people at
the outdoor tables.

57feefcc-fad9-4eda-a4e8-a6fc23b961bd-0
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.870
And across the street from that.

6b7d80b1-662e-4cfb-a61a-12c33bccfb31-0
01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.410
We have another building that's
blue.

fc394324-2b2d-443c-ad74-103adc5fa51e-0
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.340
I'm not quite sure the entrance.

12457036-9edf-42db-80ab-5b1043a7e6aa-0
01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:59.070
Has pillars and some kind of.

78badc31-d1bc-490d-9f8f-b7d275e97d92-0
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.330
Carved.

2ffbe0db-27af-43f0-9a01-57b13c3f520a-0
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:04.260
Design above the door.

d3ea13d4-b250-4935-969f-c60397324204-0
01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:11.136
And there is a window washer
hanging outside the upstairs

d3ea13d4-b250-4935-969f-c60397324204-1
01:03:11.136 --> 01:03:13.810
window. Oh, he's dropped
something.

7c4e6e11-7fdd-432d-8d35-1df0602cb90c-0
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:15.990
Umm.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.763
Going back to the center of the
page and the center of the

0ac627ea-e96c-4c15-b3ce-de054b092654-1
01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:26.369
streetscape is a fountain with
water gushing from the top and

0ac627ea-e96c-4c15-b3ce-de054b092654-2
01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:31.050
splashing into the enclosure.
Down below and at the top of the

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:35.582
splashing fountain is a person
in swim trunks with a snorkel

0ac627ea-e96c-4c15-b3ce-de054b092654-4
01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:36.920
and swim flippers.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.507
There are other people gathered
around outside this triangle

d7a5de16-f6a8-4be4-8cd0-f597bb9ed71c-1
01:03:43.507 --> 01:03:48.236
area in the center, looking at
the water, looking at the person

d7a5de16-f6a8-4be4-8cd0-f597bb9ed71c-2
01:03:48.236 --> 01:03:51.340
on top of the fountain, there's
a statue.

64fdca44-c180-44cc-9ac5-50b80f13eeab-0
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.210
Of a person in Roman garb with a
helmet and an arrow.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.091
We have another building which
might be an office building. You

66c78895-f244-4acb-8976-042d5d5e4ca2-1
01:04:07.091 --> 01:04:11.384
can look through the windows and
see, oh, people working at a

66c78895-f244-4acb-8976-042d5d5e4ca2-2

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.954
Other things like that, and
there's some ladders outside.

b1f258b6-ae81-40fe-8254-442ebfb6634a-1
01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:22.009
There are some workers upstairs
having a mock battle with their

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.396
#END_waldo-1 It looks like an
open market with Street vendors

225e6242-40ab-4268-b399-818d8ef80be4-1
01:04:54.396 --> 01:04:58.493
with little carts, with striped
awnings that are blue and red

225e6242-40ab-4268-b399-818d8ef80be4-2
01:04:58.493 --> 01:05:02.590
and green, and people gathered
around to look at what they're

225e6242-40ab-4268-b399-818d8ef80be4-3
01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:05.960
selling, whether it's plants or
food or who knows?

great.}

Waldo has a note on it that says
picture this few look at all

01:05:47.597 --> 01:05:51.812
these framed portraits, although
they may be colored differently.

01:12:48.668 --> 01:12:49.650
almost 7:30.

bb47ce32-5b6f-47df-a0b4-cda5783d327f-0
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:56.867
There's an unkempt house with a
for sale sign that the person

bb47ce32-5b6f-47df-a0b4-cda5783d327f-1
01:12:56.867 --> 01:12:59.060
our main character is looking
at.

1463eccd-4a80-447e-a570-2f816b06496f-0
01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.790
Hmm. Umm.

824d2997-4723-46f6-89b2-ad94ec007955-0
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.343
All the houses, you know,
they're a little rickety,

824d2997-4723-46f6-89b2-ad94ec007955-1
01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:10.450
they're a little off center,
they're.

9ecdfb6b-196a-4582-84f4-28e5dae80aff-0
01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:17.190
All looking a little sketchy and
dubious.

4799dc85-d2a4-49da-9e46-913db15000a3-0
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:26.190
Ohh, now it's daytime and we're
on the same.

f5faa228-93d7-42ff-ac4a-75518faf56fe-0
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.330
Stretch of Street

a885e354-88f8-4577-bdc4-1850921c8310-0
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:32.210
Um.

fbbfc88c-baea-472a-ab5b-47cd3c1abf90-0
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:39.600
The house that was for sale no
longer has the for sale sign.

e2b3f2cc-6fa4-4b67-9be3-714c8bde2419-0
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.397
And the whole page, all the
house structures are in black

e2b3f2cc-6fa4-4b67-9be3-714c8bde2419-1
01:13:44.397 --> 01:13:48.974
and white and Gray, except for
the house that was for sale. And

e2b3f2cc-6fa4-4b67-9be3-714c8bde2419-2
01:13:48.974 --> 01:13:53.050
now our main character is
wearing a blue shirt with red.

2aaa715d-24e4-4654-a3f7-cf2beb034098-0
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.122
Suspenders and is on a ladder
fixing up the house. You can see

2aaa715d-24e4-4654-a3f7-cf2beb034098-1
01:13:59.122 --> 01:14:04.070
a red lawn mower that's cut part
of the grass and there's a tree.

564cd376-fd4b-4151-b4de-8fad5644d16f-0
01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.890
By the House that is blooming
with flowers.

ec4c41ab-fe22-4ade-bb2d-b250c8e7f43c-0
01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:12.830
And this House has blue shutters
and a purple roof.

1135a0bf-39a8-4c43-b381-417c595c855b-0
01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:17.961
And the other people in the
neighborhood? There's a person

1135a0bf-39a8-4c43-b381-417c595c855b-1
01:14:17.961 --> 01:14:22.435
in a wheelchair with his leg in
a cast and someone else going by

1135a0bf-39a8-4c43-b381-417c595c855b-2
01:14:22.435 --> 01:14:23.330
on a scooter.

b8c30b0c-4e0b-486c-a010-766cbd72cdd1-0
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:30.254
Lots of people, men, women,
children walking up and down the

b8c30b0c-4e0b-486c-a010-766cbd72cdd1-1
01:14:30.254 --> 01:14:30.930
streets.

16df67ed-027f-4898-8600-c4aaae57a44f-0
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:36.681
There's a fountain across the
street. A lot of the people are

16df67ed-027f-4898-8600-c4aaae57a44f-1
01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:38.670
looking kind of down and out.

be2e71c9-a05a-40a3-bac9-5778d38f107f-0
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.540
And getting on with things.

beab66c7-7162-498a-94b3-d549e741cb91-0
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:46.110
Ohh.

a2d1ffc2-ad49-4a74-8b02-858e892186ae-0
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:53.070
And we're on another two page
spread of the same neighborhood.

9af9ba92-e0b5-4aaf-8531-9c208ed5d234-0
01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.122
And again, everything is black
and white except for the one

9af9ba92-e0b5-4aaf-8531-9c208ed5d234-1
01:14:59.122 --> 01:15:00.900
house that was for sale.

176932e8-3bad-4eca-8bf2-da602154b797-0
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.300
And.

acb9a0ce-dcf8-493c-b12e-b97ed9bb42ee-0
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.365
The man who's taking care of it
there now, flowers growing by

acb9a0ce-dcf8-493c-b12e-b97ed9bb42ee-1
01:15:08.365 --> 01:15:10.320
the fence along the yard.

6980df74-dc9b-4b0a-9fad-89334cf0c7c1-0
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.927
And the tree. I don't know if
it's autumn colors now or if

6980df74-dc9b-4b0a-9fad-89334cf0c7c1-1
01:15:16.927 --> 01:15:18.480
it's just changed.

f92dc2b7-0c62-4248-a4e8-2d77aaea1546-0
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:20.000
Umm.

7202f4c4-3fb7-4969-a940-e29ca6b15231-0
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:25.521
We can see inside the House to
the kitchen and the living room

7202f4c4-3fb7-4969-a940-e29ca6b15231-1
01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.500
with a comfy wingback chair.

575b7df9-4715-4f3f-ad36-73a36ce7bf33-0
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.811
And there continue to be people
all around on the other houses,

575b7df9-4715-4f3f-ad36-73a36ce7bf33-1
01:15:35.811 --> 01:15:40.134
on the Stoops, on the steps
hanging out of the windows, you

575b7df9-4715-4f3f-ad36-73a36ce7bf33-2
01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:42.440
get looks inside to their homes.

2e74add1-3fb5-4721-97a5-3120783612f5-0
01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.920
Some pets.

da8f4d71-514e-49bb-957b-758378a4f1fb-0
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.010
Well, there's a water fountain,
but it's all dried up.

8a70b1ee-125b-4e5f-a6fc-bf4e46c37310-0
01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.430
And there's a street vendor
pushing a vendor.

81c7ec40-5aad-4fb9-9f52-8d03a1beaf0b-0
01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:02.562
Little cart by but there's no
business. There's a mailman

81c7ec40-5aad-4fb9-9f52-8d03a1beaf0b-1
01:16:02.562 --> 01:16:07.631
delivering mail and an artist
sitting on the window sill with

81c7ec40-5aad-4fb9-9f52-8d03a1beaf0b-2
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:09.430
this painters palette.

eb9ca0fe-79c0-4791-a31c-d3a329e756b6-0
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.407
And a sketchy, almost burglar
type person hiding behind the

eb9ca0fe-79c0-4791-a31c-d3a329e756b6-1
01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:21.160
lamp post looking at the one
nice piece of property.

41b46f32-e0a8-46bb-bdcf-64d0a596a524-0
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:25.860
Ah.

09d80d24-2708-4bc5-99dc-d1de41ac6db1-0
01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.710
Now.

70d2ab29-b8e9-4b17-986a-5ba850b518f0-0
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.630
There's a little more color to
this page.

c17ade92-3766-4a7d-ad5a-e075a0e0a6e7-0
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.250
The sketchy person by the light
pole is now turned into.

67da390d-3d44-4420-abbf-c846f0403785-0
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.730
A well off looking person with a
big square chin.

f7e50d06-f64d-49d2-826c-3d360af0b5d6-0
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:50.170
But more people's clothing is
colored in. The man on the

f7e50d06-f64d-49d2-826c-3d360af0b5d6-1
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:54.550
property is greeting a girl in
green and blue with.

4b0ffe03-743c-4148-9bd4-b9bc0ccbbb6f-0
01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:59.817
Strawberry blonde hair. And
there's another person outside

4b0ffe03-743c-4148-9bd4-b9bc0ccbbb6f-1
01:16:59.817 --> 01:17:04.134
with purple pants and another
person on the street and a pink

4b0ffe03-743c-4148-9bd4-b9bc0ccbbb6f-2

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.290
And across the street.

f343ce44-1187-4f7a-a717-7917f9680a4a-0
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.581
There's a girl in a colorful
outfit hugging a man with a

f343ce44-1187-4f7a-a717-7917f9680a4a-1
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:21.544
beard and above them as a woman,
now in a green outfit in her

f343ce44-1187-4f7a-a717-7917f9680a4a-2
01:17:21.544 --> 01:17:26.426
window, and above her is an
elderly man with a beard tending

f343ce44-1187-4f7a-a717-7917f9680a4a-3
01:17:26.426 --> 01:17:30.908
his flower box outside his
window, and the tiles in the

f343ce44-1187-4f7a-a717-7917f9680a4a-4
01:17:30.908 --> 01:17:35.630
roof are beginning to be colored
in with yellows and Reds.

b8a14824-1bfb-4255-b180-d4743e60bd87-0
01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:42.604
And a few of the other houses
have little touches of color,

b8a14824-1bfb-4255-b180-d4743e60bd87-1
01:17:42.604 --> 01:17:47.638
some red brick peering through
on one house and blue and green

b8a14824-1bfb-4255-b180-d4743e60bd87-2
01:17:47.638 --> 01:17:52.751
and cream colored tile roofing
on another house and red hair on

b8a14824-1bfb-4255-b180-d4743e60bd87-3
01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:54.270
a person in purple.

Umm.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.760
Ah, curtains hanging in a
window.

Of the house next door.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.180
And lots of people on the steps.

7fb4cf99-cb5b-4fa7-91b3-351ebed1d572-0
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:16.830
OK.

7dd18e31-ce84-40ec-85e2-19142cab93f7-0
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:23.901
Ah, and now there's almost all
color in the picture. Everything

7dd18e31-ce84-40ec-85e2-19142cab93f7-1
01:18:23.901 --> 01:18:25.430

And there's water in the water
fountain, and there's a shiny

d10fcc6d-ba29-446a-900d-72fb00ca4b1b-1
01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:35.110
red car on the street. There's a
man who looks like Mr. Rogers

d10fcc6d-ba29-446a-900d-72fb00ca4b1b-2
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:39.524

Ah.

de7fb1ca-2ed6-4fb9-8ee1-25f465eb52fc-0
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:48.466
The man who moved into the house
that was for sale. There's a

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.234
What else do I see? More people.
There's somebody out. They now

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:49.690
Ah.

4c308fb8-3389-434b-ab69-0097fb85e1e7-0
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:56.350
It continues to be colorful and
it's toned down a little bit.

f91174c1-8124-4352-8f0c-276880eaab85-0
01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:02.860
I don't know if it's later in
the day. The old man who was

f91174c1-8124-4352-8f0c-276880eaab85-1
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.577
outside of his upper story
apartment tending his flower

f91174c1-8124-4352-8f0c-276880eaab85-2
01:20:07.577 --> 01:20:08.420
boxes now.

fd2cdda4-7d47-4ef6-99a7-832d16777021-0
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:12.283
On the roof and there's a
railing around and he has a

fd2cdda4-7d47-4ef6-99a7-832d16777021-1
01:20:12.283 --> 01:20:15.997
telescope and looking at the sky
and there's a girl with blonde

fd2cdda4-7d47-4ef6-99a7-832d16777021-2
01:20:15.997 --> 01:20:18.260
hair and they're looking and
pointing.

16d1e07f-5de9-41d2-a391-465fee970db7-0
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.888
There's another couple at
another rooftop, a man and a

16d1e07f-5de9-41d2-a391-465fee970db7-1
01:20:23.888 --> 01:20:27.549
woman, and his arm was around
her and they look happy

16d1e07f-5de9-41d2-a391-465fee970db7-2
01:20:27.549 --> 01:20:31.752
together. And there's another
man on another rooftop. Perhaps

16d1e07f-5de9-41d2-a391-465fee970db7-3
01:20:31.752 --> 01:20:35.820
he just took a bath or a shower
because he just has a towel

16d1e07f-5de9-41d2-a391-465fee970db7-4
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.380
wrapped around himself.

124c9a32-f254-44cc-8381-f17eb21cd52b-0
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:39.060
Umm.

2998338e-0d43-49fb-b028-00df1266f386-0
01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:43.020
There are more flower boxes.

472f459a-5d53-48eb-950e-136efdafd601-0
01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:49.444
And as we move down to the
street level, there continue to

472f459a-5d53-48eb-950e-136efdafd601-1
01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.720
be plenty of people outside.

5b09efe3-696d-41e7-bf31-d048e2e75416-0
01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:56.068
Now they're, you know, they're
looking animated and happy, and

5b09efe3-696d-41e7-bf31-d048e2e75416-1
01:20:56.068 --> 01:20:58.360
there's still water in the water
fountain.

dfbf1592-4bc1-440a-b253-e067290b7334-0
01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:02.524
The guy is still in the
wheelchair with his leg in a

dfbf1592-4bc1-440a-b253-e067290b7334-1
01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:02.820
cast.

b64f2aa5-4c21-4d5b-af52-61ba63683925-0
01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:08.250
People out on the stoop talking
to one another, laughing.

6f6718a5-0dac-47cb-84ef-58a9da820211-0
01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:12.750
The vendor with the shopping
cart.

02ca1710-f8af-4cf0-859f-818d44560a0a-0
01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.008
Is out on the street and the
shopping cart is open with

02ca1710-f8af-4cf0-859f-818d44560a0a-1
01:21:17.008 --> 01:21:18.230
colorful things in it.

8277279f-7e23-4d62-9d73-fa971956f64f-0
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:24.519
And on a bottom left side,
there's a woman sitting on the

8277279f-7e23-4d62-9d73-fa971956f64f-1
01:21:24.519 --> 01:21:29.649
edge of a bridge in a bright
pink dress and red lipstick,

8277279f-7e23-4d62-9d73-fa971956f64f-2
01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:32.480
talking and flirting with a man.

514dfdc5-4f22-4dc8-9550-cd467bb2dc0e-0
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:36.590
OK.

ad9a1438-64c8-4a46-bece-afc8d2e6c1cc-0
01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.380
And now we're.

1fabe40b-5149-41b5-90ea-7ef096dd6626-0
01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:46.700
A little bit further up, looking
down on the houses.

f8792ec7-f517-4ed5-b7c1-0727465ca3d5-0
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:50.970
Getting a slightly different
view of the neighborhood.

2213d786-cab9-45db-a9c1-fe01d7936986-0
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:59.870
The house is nearest to us, have
tattered curtains in the windows

2213d786-cab9-45db-a9c1-fe01d7936986-1
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:02.100
and then the center house.

89ed9e04-34f6-4081-9a0d-0fba6f5893e7-0
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:06.747
Downstairs it looks like it
might be a restaurant with an

89ed9e04-34f6-4081-9a0d-0fba6f5893e7-1
01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:08.500
awning and riding in the window.

c8c523b4-9b5b-4e7d-8e5b-8b3f4a9fdddb-0
01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:13.956
And then upstairs it looks like
residences in good shape, with

c8c523b4-9b5b-4e7d-8e5b-8b3f4a9fdddb-1
01:22:13.956 --> 01:22:14.830
flowers and.

292ce7f5-25fd-43a9-947c-8cb5917fe1de-0
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.420
Colorful.

e7f876a7-ceae-44f1-812d-f79fac6a960b-0
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:18.600
Shutters.

16bed746-aaac-49f7-99c6-26651f06125d-0
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:27.846
It looks like night time because
the street lights are on and we

16bed746-aaac-49f7-99c6-26651f06125d-1
01:22:27.846 --> 01:22:33.180
see a few people hanging out in
the windows. A girl with blonde

16bed746-aaac-49f7-99c6-26651f06125d-2
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:38.513
hair, a couple outside of cafe
window, a person on a motorcycle

16bed746-aaac-49f7-99c6-26651f06125d-3
01:22:38.513 --> 01:22:39.680
on the street.

ccae6b04-f7e6-4f2e-ac76-8def78a59c49-0
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:42.990
Few other people gathered under
a streetlight.

e1478318-70ce-424d-9389-1ea6705583bc-0
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:47.720
A family. It looks like a man, a
woman and a child out on a.

5e4b20c5-a046-43c3-99c5-32c4e043771e-0
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:50.330
A porch.

7a591a5d-9914-4778-807a-6dd5aedc8a68-0
01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.640
And there's a statue.

01b0b414-6e07-4383-bdb2-db5ed749a980-0
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:56.980
In the water fountain.

3d23f43a-449e-40a4-ac78-bc459f3cb59e-0
01:22:58.930 --> 01:22:59.370
OK.

4a7861e3-d11f-49db-8798-5dcda2667a2e-0
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:02.650
Ah.

bc71b389-c831-4617-8b92-fb5873aff191-0
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.360
And now the color is mostly
washed out of this picture from

bc71b389-c831-4617-8b92-fb5873aff191-1
01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.280
all the buildings and Street
except for the main character in

bc71b389-c831-4617-8b92-fb5873aff191-2
01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.279
the center of the page. It looks
like he's lighting a match or

bc71b389-c831-4617-8b92-fb5873aff191-3
01:23:18.279 --> 01:23:20.659
holding something in his hand.

4f7a9059-ed4b-4165-b956-f31c34b66b33-0
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:26.726
His color. His clothing is
colored with a purple hat and a

4f7a9059-ed4b-4165-b956-f31c34b66b33-1
01:23:26.726 --> 01:23:31.661
green jacket with a yellow lapel
and a patched up bag, like a

4f7a9059-ed4b-4165-b956-f31c34b66b33-2
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:33.890
suitcase that he's carrying.

2033de5d-f142-4433-871a-21a0a71e1ce0-0
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:39.591
And a little dog. Maybe he's
offering a treat to the dog, but

2033de5d-f142-4433-871a-21a0a71e1ce0-1
01:23:39.591 --> 01:23:44.572
all the rest of the street and
the houses are black and white,

2033de5d-f142-4433-871a-21a0a71e1ce0-2
01:23:44.572 --> 01:23:49.000
and the sky is purple with
shades of purple and clouds.

c08d144a-fb2c-43b1-9e00-9d2299a97089-0
01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:53.650
And now we have a close up.

e9b0b59d-801c-4e7a-8ad4-8de34bb97777-0
01:23:54.750 --> 01:24:00.191
There's a girl on the street and
while her house is all Shades of

e9b0b59d-801c-4e7a-8ad4-8de34bb97777-1
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:05.385
Grey, her outfit is pink and a
yellow shirt and her face is so

e9b0b59d-801c-4e7a-8ad4-8de34bb97777-2
01:24:05.385 --> 01:24:10.579
lit up and animated and smiling.
She's holding a purple flower

e9b0b59d-801c-4e7a-8ad4-8de34bb97777-3
01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:15.526
and the man with the bag. You
can just see him walking off.

e9b0b59d-801c-4e7a-8ad4-8de34bb97777-4
01:24:15.526 --> 01:24:20.720
You can just see his shoulder
and arm and there's a dog by his

e9b0b59d-801c-4e7a-8ad4-8de34bb97777-5
01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.090
side with the tail and up over
the girl in the open.

7b5e5228-03d3-4762-9709-8582ff9e767f-0
01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.465
#END_flowerman Window is a man
with glasses and a red bow tie

7b5e5228-03d3-4762-9709-8582ff9e767f-1
01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:31.480
and a red flower in his hand.

7df8295e-c97d-45e8-89ad-3cda5d32d027-0
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:37.527
{OK. So that is the story and
that's it for today. Alright,

7df8295e-c97d-45e8-89ad-3cda5d32d027-1
01:24:37.527 --> 01:24:39.110
how long was that?}

8b1262d7-095c-4192-b8e0-fe71c9b9f7c0-0
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.970
{Um, we it's about 15 minutes.}
