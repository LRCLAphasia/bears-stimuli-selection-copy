97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-0
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.160
OK, so like we talked about a
little earlier, we are going to

97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-1
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.774
show you two types of pictures
and this first type you will see

97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-2
00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:16.244
are graphic novels. OK, so they
are a series of pictures that

97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-3
00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:20.714
tell a story. So imagine you're
telling the story to somebody

97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-4
00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:24.680
who cannot see them. Describe
what you see and what is

97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.078
happening as you go through the
story and please try to take

97c12616-9a2d-484b-bef4-438953623f2f-6
00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:30.160
between 10 and.

f25bfbeb-ab0a-4a51-8e71-1b116893bfd2-0
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.610
15 minutes.

7dbf80d8-7f36-464e-9543-b200f7eaba19-0
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.603
OK, OK, so the first one has
around 20 pages and you can

7dbf80d8-7f36-464e-9543-b200f7eaba19-1
00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.630
start when you're ready.

d0ab0aae-9a00-426a-8194-7aa0271fe364-0
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.800
Uh.

f8fac400-ae81-49dd-af9a-89c27522d760-0
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.940
This is a story I'm supposed to
say in story form.

b9da4c09-a280-4bae-b2ca-91901caee0cb-0
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.760
Um, you can describe what you
see on there, describe what I

b9da4c09-a280-4bae-b2ca-91901caee0cb-1
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.333
see, OK? And because it's a
story, you can also tell the

b9da4c09-a280-4bae-b2ca-91901caee0cb-2
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:57.710
story.

ef7501c2-b58b-485c-be7f-22e9757df396-0
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.370
OK, so many pages.
#START_journey Yeah, OK, I see.

06e0f0a3-494e-4863-8feb-0fb32cce6596-0
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.026
A story about little kids
playing in the street, so it's

06e0f0a3-494e-4863-8feb-0fb32cce6596-1
00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:12.720
probably back in.

8fbd4e61-91e6-4f33-a19c-09ec4e39c66d-0
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.790
The 60s or 70s?

471a379a-38b0-4b61-b889-a0c56dbced57-0
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.930
And.

7dd672cb-7c27-4b26-ba0b-5b494f29f686-0
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.647
That's it. And ohh when a little
boy that looks lonely because he

7dd672cb-7c27-4b26-ba0b-5b494f29f686-1
00:01:27.647 --> 00:01:29.140
wants to play with somebody.

169690ad-47a7-40f6-8bee-854f2223036f-0
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.610
Yeah, and inside the apartment
building on the House.

d832cb55-7477-4075-b48e-00c20d5c4990-0
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.962
His mother's cooking. His
sister, I guess, is on the couch

d832cb55-7477-4075-b48e-00c20d5c4990-1
00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:42.840
and his dad is on the computer.

5a0a0a9b-9210-432a-8dc0-d2997288ab69-0
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.588
So that eliminates the 60s since
he's on the computer, yeah, but

5a0a0a9b-9210-432a-8dc0-d2997288ab69-1
00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:54.590
it still looks like an old,
older picture.

b05a80db-cc6e-4860-a3e6-a6c41489bea4-0
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950
OK, this one.

7082669e-03d4-4316-bc6c-efaa52f1cf66-0
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.610
Uh.

f0da5b8e-0319-433c-9871-7ef35e445c58-0
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.740
He's helping his mom cook.

f04b79c1-397d-458d-acda-cce8ae0c31ab-0
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.570
He's watching over his dad's
shoulder.

2397e681-b0de-48f8-a086-693a665bb57d-0
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.995
And he's watching his sister
read a book or whatever she's on

2397e681-b0de-48f8-a086-693a665bb57d-1
00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:17.100
on the couch.

a6f3b89d-ddc7-4994-b691-4d26ccae60b2-0
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.760
And then he goes and sits down
on his bed.

724e9783-8493-4f0c-b438-d4d84741e78b-0
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.170
Sad, it looks like he's sad.

67436bf3-90f2-4981-864f-15f84c484d52-0
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.940
Yeah.

a488a521-09eb-46ac-97d6-9798d85b86c7-0
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.510
Now here he uh.

1d42728c-63e0-4dd5-82f8-5f68bcf38f2d-0
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.347
Looks like he came up with an
idea. Oh, OK. He decided to go

1d42728c-63e0-4dd5-82f8-5f68bcf38f2d-1
00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:40.660
fly his kite, I guess.

822484f4-3f33-484c-ba80-eb4f3206a624-0
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.780
And.

dea06ec9-0eeb-4edd-a222-2458d28d6c40-0
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.800
Or make a kite and then he went
outside with it.

2a343207-0685-488e-9f30-d0a2cd9332f4-0
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.069
Or maybe not a kite. Oh, OK, I
see what he's doing. He took a

2a343207-0685-488e-9f30-d0a2cd9332f4-1
00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.744
red pen. He drew a door on the
on the wall and it became a real

2a343207-0685-488e-9f30-d0a2cd9332f4-2
00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:00.790
door and he went through it.

d5054d75-fbf6-42c3-b305-38b56adbd649-0
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.460
Then he ended up in some
enchanted forest.

96cb3463-d328-4e35-831b-8181216c8787-0
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.240
And that's all I see there.

ccb6bd9e-3fec-4306-8f9a-6bf83098ec46-0
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.130
And he.

3ae23bb7-da32-4d78-a86a-3d3a4ad368b3-0
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.810
He's standing on the dock,
looking into the river.

a0d9de59-8ca7-43e3-b16b-20761385223a-0
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.965
And he draws ohh he ok and he
draws a boat. Then he gets in

a0d9de59-8ca7-43e3-b16b-20761385223a-1
00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:31.580
the boat.

ae7da356-054c-45ab-9e55-1c8c1e1308ea-0
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.200
And the boat takes him to some
castle.

fcbe28d5-3eb6-45d5-96ed-c4b453bf885e-0
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.600
OK, that's that's it.

18c32bba-560d-4e9d-9c7d-094117762fda-0
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.740
So he floats into the castle.

f6e03354-ecee-408b-a949-7ddbde2aba49-0
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.900
The guards are waving at him.

eabb384c-7d8d-4f6a-a0ba-d0f733e54092-0
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.330
And yeah, a lot of activity is
going on.

2d8f73c5-a60c-45cc-9028-6b8bedf313b8-0
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.360
In this castle.

53ff9e80-63b5-4780-9855-34c106d534e9-0
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.100
But I guess he's going into the
castle.

ec1adfcc-02ff-460f-95e6-ceed5063c11c-0
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.480
Hmm.

3ed19cb5-e177-4da4-89c0-185e728762c6-0
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.540
Then he gets to the edge.

b48856cb-3537-4642-bb42-b0471abfdd00-0
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.250
A waterfall.

8d6275c8-b822-4aa3-a603-4d192810e444-0
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.610
And fall and about to fall over.

771232c3-cd64-43c7-b589-3adb13de5a50-0
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.020
So he draws a circle.

b155066e-bde4-46e6-ad5a-fd31d301d58d-0
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.031
So he can fall into the circle?
OK, and then he gets in the air

b155066e-bde4-46e6-ad5a-fd31d301d58d-1
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:33.660
balloon.

7d3668b3-2672-403e-9fcd-ef2d132d1271-0
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.710
And flies up.

ebbb08b7-c0ab-4d28-a791-79f9437febe3-0
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.410
To, I don't know, something in
the clouds.

071b5a67-fe20-4b29-801e-691489d33cb5-0
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.360
Another land in the clouds.

756647a1-61f8-4e73-a33c-b926b83be716-0
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.390
Yeah, so then he sees.

e0d298fb-b1b4-4276-a43b-ab1c5eab4cd2-0
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.180
Other aircraft.

5dae0edb-fe95-45d2-a2a5-e7833b918c12-0
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.060
Moving around, probably
wondering what's going on.

11a5c04b-1c8c-4340-8805-b79c516c6563-0
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.710
That's it.

7b4442b8-3b32-490a-a7db-9ee6efda25c8-0
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.780
So he lands on uh the one
aircraft.

507bc245-304c-42bb-80c7-875628eafff0-0
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.540
And uh.

8272cb4a-2861-4665-883e-72e1a440a558-0
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.037
Yeah, well, it looks like he's
landing, getting ready to land

8272cb4a-2861-4665-883e-72e1a440a558-1
00:05:22.037 --> 00:05:23.170
onto this Aircraft.

383a901f-b416-4010-a8ff-a8e0d4e67de5-0
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.810
That's it.

52f38379-207c-4123-933d-a7f2fc7d32a9-0
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.850
So he gets off the boat, air
balloon, goes into the castle.

8a0ce6fe-c380-4428-9ce7-a78302b17384-0
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.610
And he sees a bird, guards
guarding a bird.

c30b7b96-e958-4222-8a2e-0e1b380e238c-0
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.900
After he climbs up into this
building.

a9c2cc59-64d1-4a07-971f-2a63673f3d7c-0
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.200
OK so I ohh he's he tries to
seal the bird.

e01e973b-8188-4665-8c1c-b90fdd9c8e0a-0
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.950
And the guards are.

8b95a389-a717-42a6-b965-b162feca5bfe-0
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.250
Not liking that.

bb034388-7a68-4d26-9b72-0bf4f6fe0c2f-0
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.090
And then he goes and gets.

4a764ba5-d571-4c0b-ac70-1190cafc7987-0
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.571
Uh, I'm sure I'm assuming he's
trying to escape on this purple

4a764ba5-d571-4c0b-ac70-1190cafc7987-1
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:14.920
thing.

6c3e256e-19ca-4ca9-8b8c-64759355f558-0
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.464
Oh, wait, wait a minute. The
purple thing is the bird. Yeah.

6c3e256e-19ca-4ca9-8b8c-64759355f558-1
00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:24.311
OK, so he set the bird free and
and he's going to fly away on

6c3e256e-19ca-4ca9-8b8c-64759355f558-2
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:24.870
the bird.

b14d86c4-5e8d-4efb-9b74-61d973d86b5b-0
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.180
Yeah.

bf6b735f-9213-4f7a-bc36-2b426b346091-0
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.040
And he drops his red marker.

ae5cea74-335c-46c7-93bb-5cbef163fe48-0
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.600
Which is a bad thing. And then.

0b749958-19f8-4f24-b073-3b39c711d93f-0
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.890
They put him in some type of
bird cage and lowers him down.

437b1da4-42b6-418c-b782-df8441ed17d9-0
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.261
OK then the bird brings his red
marker back to him and he draw.

437b1da4-42b6-418c-b782-df8441ed17d9-1
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:02.040
He starts to Draw Something.
Something in a rectangle.

9ae22023-d40d-4abf-825f-af3561f3b221-0
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.900
OK, a magic carpet.

e53b1752-df58-489d-8784-a946a5949936-0
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.520
So he's able to fly away on this
carpet.

7ed7ab0b-ed7b-4b7a-a1bf-0a82842aee2a-0
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.640
Following the bird.

2988a0c2-81bd-4a00-8764-eb0f88300c6c-0
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.910
And then now they're getting
ready to land.

d4c9201e-0dfe-45d0-9d67-0c59751ba8e3-0
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.010
Looks like in the middle of the
desert to me.

b59424e4-e7e6-4349-bddf-8f678fd1ecb8-0
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.790
OK.

5d461fa8-2ec6-442f-9f56-4c0463afea01-0
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.760
So they land.

20038073-0f21-484d-867d-b4c60f7ec9e6-0
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.150
He sees a door in a tree.

b340c706-ee8c-4826-8044-500c0b6f165f-0
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.420
So he opens the door and goes
through it.

5b2011e1-9963-42a8-9da0-addf739b5b98-0
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.763
Then when he gets through the
door, turns out it was a

5b2011e1-9963-42a8-9da0-addf739b5b98-1
00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:55.250
mailbox.

10eb42b3-75c6-406a-9e93-1d49a425d21f-0
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.050
Right on the very street that he
just came from.

81689789-d8bf-4af2-9723-31bf7376aec6-0
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.210
So then he.

0eec0fbe-23be-4f6c-9a19-9fad13928af9-0
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.560
Sees his friend.

bdbd3123-c83c-4f7a-9e18-7129c18bb229-0
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.611
Oh, that has a purple marker. So
looks to me like he drew the

bdbd3123-c83c-4f7a-9e18-7129c18bb229-1
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:12.920
bird.

73a63234-82cc-4aaa-be94-2fce21fffa12-0
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.150
And then they end up drawing
circles, the both of them.

d256cb5e-1573-46b4-a768-5581f75088aa-0
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.000
Then it turns into a bicycle.

0c2cb250-41c3-4775-b305-2776ea326fd2-0
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.384
And they're going somewhere. The
the red marker boy is is

0c2cb250-41c3-4775-b305-2776ea326fd2-1
00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:35.250
pointing the way to the purple
marker boy. #END_journey

81e34858-e63d-4126-9528-2995edf24c82-0
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:42.110
So that was the story. It seems
to me that you're going through

81e34858-e63d-4126-9528-2995edf24c82-1
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.894
it pretty quickly. You didn't
tell the story. Next time when

81e34858-e63d-4126-9528-2995edf24c82-2
00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:51.914

the picture. Ohh OK, so then now

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:55.993
we're just looking at a
different type of pictures.

81e34858-e63d-4126-9528-2995edf24c82-4
00:08:55.993 --> 00:09:00.464
There are complex scenes.
They're just one page. Imagine

81e34858-e63d-4126-9528-2995edf24c82-5
00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:05.092
you're describing the scene to
somebody who cannot see the

81e34858-e63d-4126-9528-2995edf24c82-6
00:09:05.092 --> 00:09:05.719
picture.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.870
Describe what is happening and
what you see as thoroughly as

826628aa-8d0c-4e92-9dae-956f4cbf5fa3-1
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.470
possible and take between three
and five minutes.

7c48f078-f51b-4caa-871f-bf5ed94b9955-0
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.640
OK, and here we go.

a0bf883f-ed23-4e6f-b71f-a64d433e3d76-0
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.080
Hmm.

ab8e4704-5a83-4e28-814c-6fd25848827d-0
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.516
Right. That was about 3 minutes.
OK. So going forward, this is

ab8e4704-5a83-4e28-814c-6fd25848827d-1
00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:17.045
another story like the one
before. Tell the story, but also

ab8e4704-5a83-4e28-814c-6fd25848827d-2
00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:20.640
describe what you see. OK, here
we go.

62247e12-0445-46ad-9c66-38fcd733cc4e-0
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.510
#START_quest OK, this story
looks like a.

3a3cc2e6-a56a-44a3-b03e-0c5190868074-0
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.270
Ohh the purple and red marker
guys ended up.

b41777b8-13e7-4905-816b-9d802f08fafa-0
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:46.260
At some bridge because it's
raining and I see a statue.

278e2b7a-b83f-4942-8282-024c50f69c3c-0
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.230
Park bench, garbage can.

0811d449-bf3d-4a0d-849f-e423a958a93e-0
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.540
Street light.

b02505d9-5b29-4526-9b33-5ebb6a8cdf3d-0
00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:00.230
Trees and and another.

4ee4925e-653e-4510-a13f-45ca7630c73f-0
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.030
Statute.

43475052-918e-48ee-95c6-172b100876ff-0
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.980
And a door.

016c0265-12c3-447d-bd65-2911c94f49a2-0
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.078
And one guy's looking at the
door, I guess, debating whether

016c0265-12c3-447d-bd65-2911c94f49a2-1
00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:13.846
or not they should go in. And
the other guy was. So it looks

016c0265-12c3-447d-bd65-2911c94f49a2-2
00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:17.491
to me like they just took
shelter under this bridge to get

016c0265-12c3-447d-bd65-2911c94f49a2-3
00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:18.479
out of the rain.

eae5c264-1e9d-49b5-b1b9-e44e2f0b379c-0
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.580
Hmm.

8d801a79-bb3d-40cf-b54e-f991bb5cfba1-0
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.050
{And you know once ohh OK, go
ahead, go ahead.}

51142697-42e9-47cf-95b6-a7b3d2e85854-0
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.000
So while they're standing there,
some guy.

373a6716-ed69-46cb-8f69-e295432710a2-0
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.340
Comes out of the door.

8507e620-93a4-49b3-9cb0-51f037d7eeba-0
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.040
And hand them a piece of paper.

0a11b9fe-e6b3-4b9f-ad8f-bfda3303cee5-0
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.380
And it's still raining.

75d2f416-4c71-4a4a-8f00-f249967fd670-0
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.260
And I guess he tells them to.

c48280e5-6ab0-4cba-992f-8f29535a4a7c-0
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.727
Gives it looks like he's giving
them a map and tells and points.

c48280e5-6ab0-4cba-992f-8f29535a4a7c-1
00:16:53.727 --> 00:16:58.847
He's pointing at the map. Both
boys are looking, well one boy

c48280e5-6ab0-4cba-992f-8f29535a4a7c-2
00:16:58.847 --> 00:17:04.050
is looking at the map, the other
one is looking down and then.

2a5be824-0ea0-420d-93d8-965683adc703-0
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.710
And some guards come.

3269e4d7-e8a3-4bae-93b4-d5ba7a3783c9-0
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.666
The man drops an orange marker,
so now they have an orange

3269e4d7-e8a3-4bae-93b4-d5ba7a3783c9-1
00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:20.243
marker and the purple bird is
there. So they take the old man

3269e4d7-e8a3-4bae-93b4-d5ba7a3783c9-2
00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:25.280
back into the castle or back
into the whatever this is.

94755fcf-b476-415d-95d8-85798baa3b94-0
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.675
And so now the boys have a, one
boy as a purple marker, the

94755fcf-b476-415d-95d8-85798baa3b94-1
00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:37.058
other boy, other boy has a red
marker. Now they have an orange

94755fcf-b476-415d-95d8-85798baa3b94-2
00:17:37.058 --> 00:17:37.400
one.

3a6ec8c0-2097-4ce7-9e1e-7b1bad008b4f-0
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:39.280
Yeah.

9dee6c55-133c-4250-b79b-8f172eb07d67-0
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.840
So.

006b1c83-bc81-473c-8ec4-222a0e52a5b2-0
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.924
This picture after they closed
the door, the red marker guy

006b1c83-bc81-473c-8ec4-222a0e52a5b2-1
00:17:55.924 --> 00:18:01.340
puts the orange marker in his
waistband.

1a4fcce7-b0d3-4039-b6d7-73abdfff16f7-0
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.990
And so now they're standing in
front of the door, still waiting

1a4fcce7-b0d3-4039-b6d7-73abdfff16f7-1
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.170
for it to stop raining.

220a70a4-3af6-461a-967a-b8def8c46fa3-0
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:14.035
And he draws with the purple
marker. He draws a key and the

220a70a4-3af6-461a-967a-b8def8c46fa3-1
00:18:14.035 --> 00:18:17.790
red marker boy draws a key. Now
they have a.

a1a3718b-e8e2-4dd6-9a48-e2d25be8ee84-0
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.690
Purple Key and a red key.

61bd7053-57b5-4c8e-8a0a-f450a8e01250-0
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.024
And the bird is looking at him.
Well, it just so happens that

61bd7053-57b5-4c8e-8a0a-f450a8e01250-1
00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:28.830
both keys fit in the door.

e7e9fc3b-332a-4552-9428-fb4dffa18d8d-0
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.710
So they go through the door,
bird and all.

9adb0bb9-66a1-48da-8cf5-414aae844289-0
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.850
Then they end up.

7ebb8456-49f1-48ff-8ebe-cb3000bdf8c4-0
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.160
In front of a castle.

22ac70af-c084-451b-af2b-15003d9341d6-0
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:49.298
You have people on hot air
balloons flying over a

22ac70af-c084-451b-af2b-15003d9341d6-1
00:18:49.298 --> 00:18:50.260
waterfall.

266d3795-9d0d-4d27-b993-31c539312182-0
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.900
Guards.

892ebe73-68a5-4e2e-b671-bb248ea31422-0
00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.000
Um.

3f5d52cb-8c65-44eb-b031-67290f84a9dc-0
00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:02.490
And oh, the old man that dropped
the orange marker is there.

09989817-1138-463a-b274-26bf34d3d57b-0
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.360
And then there's people, an
audience.

64cb9690-6ce0-444f-b998-830dce6d3fbb-0
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.100
Looks like they're on a boat.

d4ad9ba0-fc49-4d92-9efd-49c9c5d91271-0
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:21.086
Hmm. And so the boys are on a
rock looking at the scene with

d4ad9ba0-fc49-4d92-9efd-49c9c5d91271-1
00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.490
this old man.

7c1ad521-e2c9-49cc-9c9f-3f315db12e29-0
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.430
Hmm.

8e2279a5-89d8-4d49-a383-1aa437cc5aee-0
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:34.796
So now they're trying to figure
out the the map he gave them. So

8e2279a5-89d8-4d49-a383-1aa437cc5aee-1
00:19:34.796 --> 00:19:35.340
I see.

668a8b38-cc29-425d-8d0a-88aa7e21e067-0
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.750
Um, looks like fire.

b12c1e51-7234-434b-bc73-476105ce6a2e-0
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.173
Something's on fire, and they're
still on that same rock, trying

b12c1e51-7234-434b-bc73-476105ce6a2e-1
00:19:46.173 --> 00:19:47.400
to figure out.

060ae1be-d8c4-410b-a33a-cde995682c9a-0
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:48.990
The map.

696903c7-f7df-46c6-913e-ecc450974f4a-0
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.601
Whereas the old man is still on
the boat with with the guard

696903c7-f7df-46c6-913e-ecc450974f4a-1
00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:54.680
with his captors.

deed491f-9df5-4830-9a9d-aca7437e62cd-0
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.560
And um.

f52fee4b-2ecc-4e59-a794-234f5c7a8907-0
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.514
They show a close up of the map
and one of the boys is pointing

f52fee4b-2ecc-4e59-a794-234f5c7a8907-1
00:20:04.514 --> 00:20:04.750
at.

b1f2282b-4f0f-43a1-aa82-9cdc697893cd-0
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.120
A yellow.

be0713a0-9383-499e-917e-da3af51ccb33-0
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.800
A yellow circle. A picture, a
building in a yellow circle.

535ca4f5-1fc6-4558-ad9d-0a8877d59f8b-0
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.040
Hmm. That's it.

3ad86ccb-9503-47e6-916c-aef1efb9efeb-0
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.330
So let me see.

6e49020e-0bff-40a1-b978-097640b51664-0
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.391
I'm seeing there's still, I'm
still seeing the waterfall, the

6e49020e-0bff-40a1-b978-097640b51664-1
00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:32.600
boys with the map.

44569aa1-8c21-47e0-a716-cce265548dd0-0
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.200
People in boats.

b510af78-ac8c-4a40-94af-267990ba3695-0
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.770
Um.

fb15dd4f-a4ed-4d77-9443-d93d3abe378e-0
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.410
Fire. I don't know if the castle
was on fire, but.

cc999836-035d-4e90-8719-dfbf546476d0-0
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.430
OK, so then the two boys decide.

caf52531-fef7-4fee-9962-c0ce2e3e06ce-0
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.570
They're on a rock.

497f7032-a62d-4529-98cd-373b5102e1f4-0
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.680
Talking to each other and they
decide to draw.

75e8e0fc-8a2b-4cb5-91c7-af5e31e39cd4-0
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:11.003
Scuba diving outfits so you know
for their head so they can

75e8e0fc-8a2b-4cb5-91c7-af5e31e39cd4-1
00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:14.150
breathe and flippers on their
feet.

f400992d-588b-478d-9680-a87856ae168e-0
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:20.767
And a octopus and or yeah, the
bird turns into an octopus,

f400992d-588b-478d-9680-a87856ae168e-1
00:21:20.767 --> 00:21:26.154
looks like. And and then they
all swim down into the water.

f400992d-588b-478d-9680-a87856ae168e-2
00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:31.990
No, the bird doesn't turn it off
to us. He draws an octopus. And

f400992d-588b-478d-9680-a87856ae168e-3
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.569
all, now all four of them are in
the in the water.

721e990a-0e50-4080-bcaf-be96c5232510-0
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:48.440
OK, so then they go to now I see
the octopus up close.

981ca0f4-88e7-4c9d-b82c-8646c76f4728-0
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.710
They're inside of a building.

1453bf91-38af-4c31-82ed-e05a208c6b3b-0
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:03.110
I see other fish, a statue.

ec340a2f-6250-48c9-a60f-9a16cfc7631c-0
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.577
You know they're headed towards
this building that was in the

ec340a2f-6250-48c9-a60f-9a16cfc7631c-1
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:09.570
circle on the map.

1f6ef322-eac3-49f2-9416-399c9ae805c1-0
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.620
And um.

0ccbe6a6-d9f5-4a89-bc56-0ffcb033b2e1-0
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.570
I'm seeing.

b35d3682-3b9e-4251-8ca1-4cc717de0d15-0
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.180
Yeah, columns just holding up
the building and.

92a56422-882a-48cd-a08c-401910a822e3-0
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.240
Umm, a well lit.

30fdaf47-1211-4d36-8024-0c5001bbee42-0
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.190
entrance. I guess that's what
they're heading for.

6e36dfba-7bd8-4173-8d28-6d6b23cc4e2a-0
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.611
That's it. OK, so they get to
the well lit entrance and they

6e36dfba-7bd8-4173-8d28-6d6b23cc4e2a-1
00:22:40.611 --> 00:22:43.610
see something on the statue.

5f71f7cf-af39-474c-87e5-b20c829b12db-0
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:56.574
sea lions, the the the the
statue is made like sea lions. I

5f71f7cf-af39-474c-87e5-b20c829b12db-1
00:22:56.574 --> 00:22:59.150
see other fish.

7af2b7cd-548c-4076-bc59-4fb3405a62fa-0
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.050
Other statues, seaweed.

0d3db4f2-7b65-4c1f-9a82-a0fe02a1ec5f-0
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.232
And they're picking up
something. Looks to me like it's

0d3db4f2-7b65-4c1f-9a82-a0fe02a1ec5f-1
00:23:11.232 --> 00:23:13.240
a yeah, OK, a yellow.

d62469a8-240e-4e3f-8d70-2ddf245fe352-0
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.670
Um, marker.

479d2695-53b6-4702-84f1-899e49d91afe-0
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.592
So then now the guards are are
coming for them, so they have to

479d2695-53b6-4702-84f1-899e49d91afe-1
00:23:23.592 --> 00:23:26.000
swim off while dude puts the.

8ff6ea94-c65b-4e67-8c80-fa518521e09d-0
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.380
Yellow marker in his.

ae639eff-17ce-4fc4-b54c-e43149e1185e-0
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.187
Well, that looks like a bullet.
One of those things were bullets

ae639eff-17ce-4fc4-b54c-e43149e1185e-1
00:23:35.187 --> 00:23:39.533
to put bullets in, but he's
putting markers in it and then

ae639eff-17ce-4fc4-b54c-e43149e1185e-2
00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.890
they swim off to the next place.

f03cb442-ed92-4b6e-893c-9474043a3169-0
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.340
On the map.

ffcadcc6-9bf5-4add-83ff-71d77b1591b3-0
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.810
So now I'm seeing trees. Palm
trees.

2d666db7-7b58-4024-82b3-287839dc4557-0
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.740
Like they've on an island.

b7b8e292-7adf-46bc-b8cd-d11c60973a6a-0
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.890
So they go to this island.

c4b9950f-755c-402a-8541-9535193b2390-0
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.490
Take off their flippers. Bird is
still with them.

ac1f8d7e-5e4c-47f2-9fe8-463627eaa865-0
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:15.370
And I see the sky, sun, water.
Now they're drawing something.

f3c294e5-2660-4de5-b969-6a2093324275-0
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.690
With a red and purple marker
while the bird looks on.

d72bcaa2-b5fa-489f-b72f-cca16deaec66-0
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.940
OK, so.

f7bd807b-db2b-4459-a894-b87aa300cbdc-0
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.840
Now they're, right. Now I'm
seeing a purple rhinoceros.

f86a9392-c81e-4720-b1c1-80f1c4815e13-0
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.330
With a red.

cfa3ec6c-d946-4537-8bdc-ae1c51b5783b-0
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:43.176
Saddle that has a cover to it,
so they're riding this

cfa3ec6c-d946-4537-8bdc-ae1c51b5783b-1
00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:50.450
rhinoceros going to a castle. I
see two statues, more palm

cfa3ec6c-d946-4537-8bdc-ae1c51b5783b-2
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.190
trees.

ff5ea4eb-a420-4632-9f19-08b842a1f42c-0
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.570
And.

5399f2f4-b0f1-4bd1-8af5-fd1a28e29c6b-0
00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.280
Over here I see a.

fe360236-c539-491f-8654-4bba08c3c6cc-0
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.142
Looks like it might be a
lighthouse in the middle of the

fe360236-c539-491f-8654-4bba08c3c6cc-1
00:25:04.142 --> 00:25:04.460
water.

00a3e6c5-67ac-440a-80fb-42e3de5f5417-0
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.970
Uh hmm.

6e092fc1-877e-4eb0-b8d3-9c93898ae04b-0
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.050
Waterfall, grass, trees.

7a04ad72-2a8c-4633-801f-d40d06c4c6dc-0
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.230
I don't see the boys anymore in
this one.

00b199b3-737f-410e-8867-a6c0857b6f31-0
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:25.335
And so then they run across the
bridge, one of those bridges

00b199b3-737f-410e-8867-a6c0857b6f31-1
00:25:25.335 --> 00:25:26.220
that you

8d3ad1b1-83f6-4c95-83b2-aa9f9bb64644-0
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.660
Would be afraid to walk on.

e1c351d9-7385-4f16-9d3d-9e21deba0dac-0
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:37.286
And to the lighthouse. So I'm
seeing, uh, the, the the Cliff

e1c351d9-7385-4f16-9d3d-9e21deba0dac-1
00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:43.541
that they just came off of, the
two boys, the bird, sky, water

e1c351d9-7385-4f16-9d3d-9e21deba0dac-2
00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:49.400
and this lighthouse. So they're
headed for the lighthouse.

b296d250-3a41-4850-a73a-bf691924214e-0
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.466
And then when they get there,
they get on top of the

b296d250-3a41-4850-a73a-bf691924214e-1
00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:58.310
lighthouse with the guards
chasing them.

288f7b2f-9870-4b9f-b70d-c940a3a041c8-0
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.411
So I'm seeing the land that they
just came from that they're on

288f7b2f-9870-4b9f-b70d-c940a3a041c8-1
00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:09.070
top of the lighthouse, the bird
is there now. They're drawing.

d83ae2bf-bdc3-4418-a5db-c07fd8818fbf-0
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.190
Something.

5735a9cb-6cd8-415f-ae8e-eb5a98826605-0
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.910
That I don't know what it is
yet.

d3fbeb34-defe-446c-87ce-04dc2db80ea5-0
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:23.948
OK. And so it turns out to be a
swing and a giant insect. That's

d3fbeb34-defe-446c-87ce-04dc2db80ea5-1
00:26:23.948 --> 00:26:27.940
what it looks like to me. So I'm
seeing.

532c3bee-229b-4ddc-a25d-25e071632f71-0
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.580
The guards trying to reach out
to him.

da1b9e4c-3f16-4817-89b9-d7e2eb547c67-0
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.210
But they're just out of reach.

6098fc89-6f06-4e28-9fe3-1d463d5c4986-0
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.340
Snow covered mountains.

ee140d20-6be7-4a9c-a706-060ac79b6c92-0
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.940
A hot air balloon still.

e72f302c-9128-4db6-be36-6b9d612f6c78-0
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.460
And they're being carried off by
a giant.

cc40c711-0929-44ed-ad1d-f010fc98195a-0
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:56.443
I'm gonna say mosquito, the
giant mosquito, and I'm seeing

cc40c711-0929-44ed-ad1d-f010fc98195a-1
00:26:56.443 --> 00:26:59.900
the water and clouds in the sky.

900699d5-1ca2-4525-aab7-c2f3bb16575e-0
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:09.580
And then they end up landing on
top of a building.

b71cf46b-1fea-41b9-9e8b-2cdb67e330e2-0
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:19.920
The purple mosquito drops them
off of a red swing, and a purple

b71cf46b-1fea-41b9-9e8b-2cdb67e330e2-1
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:26.692
bird is filled with them. And
um, oh, I see the guards coming

b71cf46b-1fea-41b9-9e8b-2cdb67e330e2-2
00:27:26.692 --> 00:27:33.137
in in hot air balloons, so
they're still chasing them. And

b71cf46b-1fea-41b9-9e8b-2cdb67e330e2-3
00:27:33.137 --> 00:27:39.800
now they're at the top of this
building trying to figure out

b71cf46b-1fea-41b9-9e8b-2cdb67e330e2-4
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.220
what to draw.

34286cd4-e23d-4809-9c4b-deaf67b615fb-0
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.910
To get them out of this
predicament.

7919ca6d-caab-44f4-8a66-b2bf288df1e1-0
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:44.930
Hmm.

6476fa61-85c4-4fb2-afc3-eeed3d4c0fd2-0
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:53.570
So now I see a guards all over
the place in hot air balloons.

f1a3d420-87d4-43f9-a2db-f9029ecad4ce-0
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.273
Just determined to to catch
these two and the bird. I see

f1a3d420-87d4-43f9-a2db-f9029ecad4ce-1
00:28:02.273 --> 00:28:05.210
the sky, top of the building.

52ba8c1b-5f33-46f5-87f3-14a75535905b-0
00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:07.560
Um.

4439ba2f-6099-4e63-a7ea-fbd518725653-0
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.690
Still hot air balloons.

0e55d5eb-17c6-4a71-86d5-8c8a4dd9a713-0
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.010
That's it.

6e203487-1c7a-431f-b72e-102d155340f0-0
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:23.997
OK, so now the boys have drawn a
rainbow. That's what I see, a

6e203487-1c7a-431f-b72e-102d155340f0-1
00:28:23.997 --> 00:28:29.040
rainbow. And well, the the the
bird helps them.

66ec24c7-c290-46e5-954f-ed3e1c38eb72-0
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:37.610
And still see guards in hot air
balloons.

005e49d0-5e68-42f7-88c6-f144feab2a0e-0
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.380
Um.

b2bc5e07-4238-41d9-84ee-ac401a74b23f-0
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:50.580
And water, sky, mountains.

a80e47cc-1b42-47ac-8b0c-f086caf2721a-0
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:03.700
So I still see the rainbow and
the reflection of it in.

c667c447-2c76-44bb-9aa0-a0e801554f89-0
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:11.084
In the water, the old guy that
gave them the orange marker and

c667c447-2c76-44bb-9aa0-a0e801554f89-1
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:15.912
some other people, I guess
guards, No, those are like just

c667c447-2c76-44bb-9aa0-a0e801554f89-2
00:29:15.912 --> 00:29:20.985
regular people in a boat and an
orange boat at the end of the

c667c447-2c76-44bb-9aa0-a0e801554f89-3
00:29:20.985 --> 00:29:21.640
rainbow.

3a622801-19c9-4d02-8656-2bbf05f33b25-0
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.090
And then the bird flies away.

fa9879ad-e0e0-4112-8d97-f5d01d7b171d-0
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.952
And so that's what I see. The
Orange Boat, a building, the

fa9879ad-e0e0-4112-8d97-f5d01d7b171d-1
00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:32.440
castle.

f5328f49-3e7f-49e4-b1a7-fb11e1b10106-0
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.680
Snow covered mountains.

d50a22a4-fa40-411d-80cb-1b3aaf3c6964-0
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.470
And water.

3564b5a8-c827-4cd5-b529-380ba22a1c50-0
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.920
OK, so here.

8ed4c2f8-250c-46f9-90ff-b6da4541b2eb-0
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.680
I'm still seeing the rainbow.

6f9f1ea9-ab37-434f-94a3-e043d7eb07eb-0
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.231
People are looking at this,
these two boys and the old man

6f9f1ea9-ab37-434f-94a3-e043d7eb07eb-1
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:58.810
now on this purple rhinoceros.

b6e2d752-fd82-4fa3-908d-27f890388bc4-0
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:01.260
And um.

cee484c3-7fbf-4d35-bf72-d3d1c058914a-0
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.846
I guess they saved the day.
Yeah. Yeah. So now you get your

cee484c3-7fbf-4d35-bf72-d3d1c058914a-1
00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:16.090
purple octopus in the water, and
the people who live in this town

cee484c3-7fbf-4d35-bf72-d3d1c058914a-2
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:21.198
are. Looks like they're
celebrating, celebrating that

cee484c3-7fbf-4d35-bf72-d3d1c058914a-3
00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:23.280
the boys rescued them.

18bf2c4a-4a09-49e8-ac2c-664dc336ff93-0
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:29.280
And I'm still seeing the Purple
bird, buildings, houses.

092f2e92-72b1-4714-a013-1d5f65a67aa6-0
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:37.948
And the boat, the the orange
boat. And like they're going

092f2e92-72b1-4714-a013-1d5f65a67aa6-1
00:30:37.948 --> 00:30:40.390
well, going somewhere.

c42f7e0a-37d1-4a70-bbef-279581dff63d-0
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.000
Hmm.

bba21291-eed8-44fa-a249-62fc77d3c9f6-0
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.300
And.

ca50b8fe-7e8c-4d1b-b7d3-5bbf5c567c40-0
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:53.266
Then they get to the rock, the
original rock that that they

ca50b8fe-7e8c-4d1b-b7d3-5bbf5c567c40-1
00:30:53.266 --> 00:30:57.170
came into. I see a waterfall,
the doorway.

df075c03-fd07-465f-8b1d-bb72a6b77fea-0
00:30:58.930 --> 00:30:59.690
Um.

97223241-b1e9-496a-9cbb-0295e733d4ac-0
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.820
Purple octopus, purple
rhinoceros.

a564a7e3-ba25-46bf-8d23-8b90e9685b02-0
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.970
And the old guy. And they're
getting off the rhinoceros.

302f535b-e692-48df-9aa8-93e8fe32a8f8-0
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:20.291
And they go back, oh wait, he's
drawing them something with the

302f535b-e692-48df-9aa8-93e8fe32a8f8-1
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:25.212
orange marker. Ohh a crown. So
he draws a crown for the little,

302f535b-e692-48df-9aa8-93e8fe32a8f8-2
00:31:25.212 --> 00:31:29.825
for the boys. They say goodbye
and they go back through the

302f535b-e692-48df-9aa8-93e8fe32a8f8-3
00:31:29.825 --> 00:31:31.209
door they came in.

6cd311b8-91b6-46a4-800a-69c516e5c268-0
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.360
And and now they're back home.

5abca7c1-35ca-4d67-ae23-755eb6eac98a-0
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:45.164
Under this bridge, I'm seeing
the bridge. I see the rainbow.

5abca7c1-35ca-4d67-ae23-755eb6eac98a-1
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:47.160
So it stopped raining.

c7afb287-cbaa-44a3-84a9-65412d943f42-0
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:53.365
Ground is still wet though, and
I'm seeing statues on each side

c7afb287-cbaa-44a3-84a9-65412d943f42-1
00:31:53.365 --> 00:31:56.740
of the building, buildings in
the background.

55a10e17-23e1-4431-842b-30e39b8dcbe7-0
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.160
And the two boys have their
crowns on. #END_quest

56677e94-6691-4769-8d04-8d329fc0a84b-0
00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:11.574
Umm, so that was the story. I
know at the details. OK, so

56677e94-6691-4769-8d04-8d329fc0a84b-1
00:32:11.574 --> 00:32:14.610
let's now take a break.

6f439b61-c203-4e69-998c-ccfbfda49002-0
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.187
OK, so this next one is also a
graphic novel. It also has

6f439b61-c203-4e69-998c-ccfbfda49002-1
00:32:21.187 --> 00:32:22.370
around 20 pages.

4789fecf-d27b-45bd-a7cb-f23ed3cf8a1c-0
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.682
So keep doing what you were
doing. Describe what you see and

4789fecf-d27b-45bd-a7cb-f23ed3cf8a1c-1
00:32:27.682 --> 00:32:29.480
what is happening in details.

102c2af9-c68a-4612-8551-ec9a70c0a15a-0
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.520
OK.

2f0b2fb0-c364-43ab-89f9-b8267d9530a9-0
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.000
OK, um.

91f6d4af-0856-4640-a19f-6f7b17cc2e93-0
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.700
Give me a drop something.

7d6abff7-5c91-4194-bd58-28df4580161e-0
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.530
#START_return OK, I see.

932a3422-f23a-4d3c-8bac-13070bdb74f7-0
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:53.055
A picture of the inside of
people's house, somebody's

932a3422-f23a-4d3c-8bac-13070bdb74f7-1
00:32:53.055 --> 00:32:53.440
house.

b52983df-1c67-4cfd-b2de-41ded1c98f33-0
00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.010
The father is on the on the
second floor.

953bdae6-7d70-4da6-9046-ee340dd3f126-0
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.340
Looks like he's drawing
something.

c2833163-8c57-4631-87b7-9ae09837031b-0
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.300
And um.

0bb909ff-7e1e-44e3-8109-e04a55295262-0
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.300
And I see a red kite.

0ab0c3df-a38d-45e6-92a9-005733baab64-0
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.260
Then in the next room and down
the stairs.

5f96d25d-ec98-458c-b3c8-be9d38d35536-0
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.090
I see the tail of a kite.

d10e9364-44ff-41ec-b682-f0c9fbe68351-0
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:25.140
With the the the room has a
picture on the wall, computer.

53bd82a5-20f4-44a8-81d2-fbd20862c4c3-0
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.270
Two pictures on the wall. A
plant.

d11eae8e-0efe-4854-a201-f9237bf13cfd-0
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.430
Well, 4 pictures on the wall.

48dd182c-b0de-46a4-bc07-bffbb3cccbd5-0
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.840
And then um.

cab92b4a-82df-468c-ae9b-911c775c7469-0
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.650
Then I'm also seeing the outside
of this, of this House.

04a62259-6861-4203-a14e-34d1e4725b91-0
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:47.509
Those the stoplight, trees, sky,
other buildings in the

04a62259-6861-4203-a14e-34d1e4725b91-1
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:48.660
background.

8e0f17a8-617e-47ed-a7fb-d7619598b499-0
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.340
And um.

e412f71b-5d9b-4601-b265-407387ca2b2e-0
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:58.020
Then the next room in the house
is somebody's bedroom.

45d4d1c9-a03a-4c43-9595-19e6e7867dee-0
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.950
Looks like with a cat laying on
top of.

4c162170-15ee-4fa1-80a5-cf97657ca7e1-0
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:10.211
Something and a window and a
lamp. And then the next room is

4c162170-15ee-4fa1-80a5-cf97657ca7e1-1
00:34:10.211 --> 00:34:12.810

aaac1f59-62dc-49c0-a4bc-7daa70489d81-0
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.090
And a trash can.

f544177a-c4dc-4045-854b-d6aefbed5afb-0
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.320
Downstairs.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:25.880
On the 1st floor.

8318bdea-04b4-4486-8015-fd8efed5fef1-0
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:28.840
I'm seeing a.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:35.459
The Little boy's room with the
red marker. The little boy with

b68dab00-0043-4a40-adba-b12c8e695a8d-1
00:34:35.459 --> 00:34:40.430
the red marker boy, and he has
his orange crown on still.

fad46146-491e-4b8f-97ba-ce4fc3d94d7f-0
00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:46.484
I see a window, a light or
that's not a light. That's a

fad46146-491e-4b8f-97ba-ce4fc3d94d7f-1
00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:48.910
basketball hoop look like.

1f28d515-bc32-4c01-8a04-afb1f6cd69de-0
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.320
His bed, dresser.

908a5399-7703-4495-8d8f-6157f43f14ba-0
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.110
And he's drawing a a door in the
wall.

35a66327-870d-47e2-9360-7e8a90c0937a-0
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:58.620
Then I see the stairway.

60a59b1e-d369-4a4a-83c3-f1cc3d4eff3e-0
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:05.704
Leading that leads upstairs.
Then this looks like the

60a59b1e-d369-4a4a-83c3-f1cc3d4eff3e-1
00:35:05.704 --> 00:35:08.360
kitchen. Cupboards, stove.

bd0305f6-e08f-4b1c-a582-08381f94fd7b-0
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.820
And and then next to that.

3c1a26c0-52ac-4e9c-9dbe-258876d80889-0
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:19.450
I see a another room looks like
the front door. Coat rack.

8ed361fb-46de-478e-9613-49f027fd5ed6-0
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.780
Mirror, stairway.

5fa3c3be-b87d-4d60-8eba-2ae8af46c266-0
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:29.549
Lamp, pictures on the wall. A
vase or vase. of a table and

5fa3c3be-b87d-4d60-8eba-2ae8af46c266-1
00:35:29.549 --> 00:35:33.550
then down in the basement I'm
seeing the.

9e04807f-f62c-42f1-a316-3eb611c816d7-0
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.510
That looks like a hot water tank
sewer.

bce989b5-755e-4fd6-97ee-80e47979662d-0
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.513
And some other things that
they've stored, like a surfboard

bce989b5-755e-4fd6-97ee-80e47979662d-1
00:35:43.513 --> 00:35:46.440
guitar case that they've stored
in the basement.

77f8643f-b937-499b-a86a-9d07f22ea745-0
00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.400
Hmm.

31c9aab8-83dd-4aa4-9c2f-b03acf059d42-0
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:58.852
OK, the father is looking at a,
looks away from his drawing, and

31c9aab8-83dd-4aa4-9c2f-b03acf059d42-1
00:35:58.852 --> 00:36:01.160
looks at the kite.

d73c28bd-b2e3-482e-9bbe-7ac4f95b3d6c-0
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.400
He gets off his stool.

ddf5c4d4-ead9-44b8-bc93-86d486a29d3f-0
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.270
picks up the kite.

268c8e4f-26ce-4214-bbc8-b99405af0f1c-0
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:15.379
And then the next picture is the
drawing table, the stool that he

268c8e4f-26ce-4214-bbc8-b99405af0f1c-1
00:36:15.379 --> 00:36:18.690
was sitting on, the kite, but no
him, no man.

3d21a645-3985-45ce-b88b-11172cc16036-0
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.590
And so he goes into his son's
room.

77d007f2-b365-49a8-ae3e-71a3c6fa674a-0
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.620
Where I'm seeing.

440ee6a2-6fe6-4d94-b6ba-93b8871124e8-0
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:32.819
It looks like a replica of a hot
air balloon, replica of the

440ee6a2-6fe6-4d94-b6ba-93b8871124e8-1
00:36:32.819 --> 00:36:35.450
mosquito, a map on the wall.

10ac6088-ce76-42cd-bcbc-7fcb77bb7184-0
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:48.063
A replica of the rhinoceros and
a replica of the octopus. I'm

10ac6088-ce76-42cd-bcbc-7fcb77bb7184-1
00:36:48.063 --> 00:36:49.640
seeing a.

0b206965-d12d-4598-947c-ce2a0dfa2a7e-0
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:56.528
Window, pictures on the wall.
The dad is looking through the

0b206965-d12d-4598-947c-ce2a0dfa2a7e-1
00:36:56.528 --> 00:36:56.970
door.

753f15de-ae26-4ad2-9ea6-34f1167e4a1c-0
00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.330
That the boy just drew.

b3a0ca05-4106-4a31-8ff9-144d0f1748e2-0
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.690
Curious curiously.

690c6a6d-0459-4876-a1d7-26b94ccd26f0-0
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:04.640
Hmm.

cb33b494-a522-46ea-ac07-27fc0c3d1b4c-0
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.338
OK, so now the dad walks through
the door. Now he's in the

cb33b494-a522-46ea-ac07-27fc0c3d1b4c-1
00:37:12.338 --> 00:37:16.930
Enchanted Forest that the boy
was in. I'm seeing trees.

70f80deb-0a1c-4b66-9c28-67e80a0f8b33-0
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.470
Uh, strings of lights, lanterns.

a85f7fa5-b053-4ceb-bae1-a7ae4ce16ccd-0
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:24.590
Umm.

cd660c1d-259e-48e8-bb8a-1d72ff4e4887-0
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:32.477
Water, a river stream running
through and the dock, and a red

cd660c1d-259e-48e8-bb8a-1d72ff4e4887-1
00:37:32.477 --> 00:37:35.800
ball or something on the dock.

95117df1-a764-4331-855b-d25e9841731c-0
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:44.880
OK, so the father gets on to the
dock somehow, picks up the ball.

266d534f-6317-4146-a63a-d2dc937adee1-0
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.630
Still seeing trees and lanterns
and string lights. Now a boat.

1e84e346-6e57-40f9-b189-16ff15dd10bb-0
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.190
In the shape of a.

eb113d79-3231-4847-860c-7631919dd9fb-0
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.110
Well, I'm gonna say a giant,
some kind of sea creature.

acab3288-81fd-46e9-b90a-c0ff85f4c187-0
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.040
So the sea creature comes up to
the dock.

1f41f41d-c712-4910-b93d-034b79cffa0a-0
00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.670
The father gets in the boat and
then it takes off.

f55e5458-b370-424f-96ac-23835a8532f8-0
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.180
Then they approached this
castle.

0b64392d-c35d-426c-af42-b758f1a1a380-0
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.720
The father is.

20d17a64-a0b5-4eae-94c9-569cfea6e738-0
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.760
Probably wondering where they
are.

925626a6-0dd6-4959-ab89-1bfddf7b3f74-0
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.450
I'm seeing the castle, sky.

20cc8f3e-8750-40dd-be9f-51a4d50874f4-0
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.250
Water.

7e9e6a58-c246-4fc0-a430-e7101f0900c9-0
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.100
The door to the castle.

4cdb3f37-eafd-4095-806f-a70d4652cbc7-0
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.140
And.

c92e913c-07cb-48ca-a82b-b2531dac40a7-0
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.160
Somehow this the.

9db6dd86-0659-47ed-abdd-a56d9f788e2d-0
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.980
Well I see the boy in the red
boat with the Orange Crown

386eb39f-51ed-4f38-b03e-24c04033fecf-0
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:57.613
Going across some some bridge.
So I'm I'm seeing the castle

386eb39f-51ed-4f38-b03e-24c04033fecf-1
00:38:57.613 --> 00:38:58.870
still. A moon.

ec7584e9-2085-4018-88fe-fb4ad956c535-0
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.020
Dark sky. So it's at night.

4e4bfa0c-dfba-404f-ba6a-836bbccd7c33-0
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.970
Um, water.

927a3347-a7d3-49df-a510-64109b19bd5d-0
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.500
And.

8ff7387c-3cc5-4244-9f3b-b43f52278c9b-0
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.500
That's it.

124d498f-687c-42ec-b39b-2a0231d1a788-0
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:19.420
OK, so now the father gets up to
the door of the castle.

9ca70f04-87b5-47b3-852e-48e0aa97c762-0
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:28.020
Gets off the boat. Now I'm
seeing guards or a guard or two

9ca70f04-87b5-47b3-852e-48e0aa97c762-1
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.460
of them, and.

238a4e30-a4df-43c8-9464-66ff6339fa8b-0
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:37.453
Both boys with the orange
crowns, the purple bird, the old

238a4e30-a4df-43c8-9464-66ff6339fa8b-1
00:39:37.453 --> 00:39:38.940
man that they.

bcdfd5b8-be4a-4e1a-a0f1-79ab023dc120-0
00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.750
Rescued.

19dc749f-82f9-419a-82f9-c57887f8721c-0
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.430
I see uh

c43f4075-265e-498e-b2a4-835c0e81796e-0
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.540
People.

d081bf14-f112-489e-a3d9-53155c19a062-0
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:53.040
Standing on the balcony of the
castle, looking.

f88d2be3-426e-48fc-9416-29707420ba0a-0
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.890
And and then the boy's red boat
is in the water.

1c82d4aa-5984-465b-8832-45f9c5c08ec6-0
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.180
And here.

a027ffba-3ffc-4c9a-a0a7-7a4fb5bd4252-0
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.860
Next page the father.

5fc2e98c-2177-4cb3-938e-846d5fd8221f-0
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:09.910
Is, I guess, trying to talk to
the boy.

f5b485b9-8543-4448-af33-73aa20dff80b-0
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:17.320
And the other little boy. I see
a a like a King's throne.

d660f282-cf93-41fe-8ecc-a30ddf0ad3a4-0
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.440
And.

23a697f6-197c-48cd-8b2b-5b6f55cf30b7-0
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.180
I guess he's refusing to get in
it or sit on it.

df9a5ee4-94a3-4de7-a333-9a467f020fd0-0
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.970
Hmm.

8c110666-3930-4c28-9768-8dd238b9909e-0
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:40.900
So the next picture I'm seeing
still the night sky, the castle.

cebb5fc1-153a-4134-8050-5e1360be87af-0
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:48.580
I see a guard standing in front
of the boat.

a6da0baf-edff-44ad-a00a-6c617160e150-0
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:56.190
The father, the purple bird, old
man and the two boys.

c36a8d4f-42cd-4324-9ef2-252e45312347-0
00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.020
People still on the balcony
looking.

e6c9330e-285f-4392-a644-87e9d8d264af-0
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.140
And on the next page.

ff9b6263-2906-488a-aae6-81325bd56640-0
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.850
Night Sky with stars in it.

3f1e90b5-e645-4254-98cb-04b45ccf21b2-0
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.910
The boat.

e6149a65-ee96-4006-9ca3-eade424c88f8-0
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.640
I see water.

2ae341d5-7bb2-4161-b239-069b5ff47ee4-0
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.010
The father, the two boys,
guards.

f0b965ea-ba96-4356-bac1-5e7385a49b9c-0
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.840
The old man is holding something
up.

516902c6-ee5e-4d52-a513-434956617622-0
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.890
The orange marker looks like.

c2626a55-12ee-4ffd-8ad9-2f6fbc411bef-0
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.140
And that's that.

675ac364-28c0-4af5-9fdc-736254169306-0
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.885
OK, so now the old man is
drawing something with his

675ac364-28c0-4af5-9fdc-736254169306-1
00:41:35.885 --> 00:41:36.570
marker.

e9c3b04a-34b5-4c0c-b6de-0507bc2d3950-0
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.050
The father and the two boys are
looking.

ad04bbc2-f8b1-48d4-af68-e17e6d7c977f-0
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.910
The, uh looking at him. The.

80746be6-200d-48ca-97f5-5ee23cdf9c0e-0
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.920
Hmm, I see two guards.

59ea9c3e-8b95-4d08-b818-47ef00f3c3eb-0
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.990
I see another boy.

906fe741-881d-49de-848c-0e603130a888-0
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:59.590
And the castle. Parts of the
castle. Night Sky with stars.

4b380b4b-9f92-4a46-85dc-8d2af9a73bf4-0
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.050
One of the guards is holding a.

67559ac6-60a9-4848-b2fb-ce13029f492a-0
00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.760
I don't know what that is.

41145fa1-3236-499d-9a7b-292067ba0e14-0
00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.550
A music box, a siren, something.

6b5e1e45-8745-4216-84b8-ba0e801c4f38-0
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.920
And so the old man is is
standing on this steps.

867a23cf-fae9-419f-97cb-cb8fcef2e27b-0
00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:22.410
Pointing his rod at him. I guess
that's what he drew.

f5cbe6e0-3757-44d4-a70e-b4442d31dda7-0
00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.690
And trying to stop the guard.

7c3ba217-eed9-4586-94c0-523d3a79b88b-0
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:33.070
Then the guard points the.

5cdfa412-a0c4-458f-9dcf-068173e9136c-0
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.330
What I thought was a music box.

e39498f8-c061-4f11-a428-c4524397adca-0
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.115
And, uh, looks like it might be
some type of vacuum where he's

e39498f8-c061-4f11-a428-c4524397adca-1
00:42:42.115 --> 00:42:46.631
he's taking, you know, taking
all the markers off from the old

e39498f8-c061-4f11-a428-c4524397adca-2
00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:51.146
man. The guards grabbed the old
man, and then the guy with the

e39498f8-c061-4f11-a428-c4524397adca-3
00:42:51.146 --> 00:42:51.289
um

310c097a-f67d-4b53-a2ed-3a52d5887ce8-0
00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.330
Vacuum runs off.

f62bfacc-9b42-4833-b3e9-4e7a68e7dd46-0
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:05.964
OK, now the next picture. I see
the father, the two boys, the

f62bfacc-9b42-4833-b3e9-4e7a68e7dd46-1
00:43:05.964 --> 00:43:12.058
guy with the thing in his hand,
vacuum, I'm going to call it.

f62bfacc-9b42-4833-b3e9-4e7a68e7dd46-2
00:43:12.058 --> 00:43:17.660
Bird, purple bird. And the boy
with the purple marker is

f62bfacc-9b42-4833-b3e9-4e7a68e7dd46-3
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.870
drawing something with a wing,
something with wings.

dc75f160-0871-4171-b5e1-782a666f82bf-0
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:29.640
This picture still I'm seeing
the moon, night sky with stars.

9b5c5fe1-d034-40d9-934b-0aea1059ed3a-0
00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:37.130
A man is on the balcony of the.

f81ca900-cb32-4ac5-ad1e-718d04c9e61f-0
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.260
Uh, castle. And he's reaching
out.

93fe55eb-756f-418a-b1d0-4194c0824c2e-0
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:48.890
I don't know whose side he's on
yet, but then I see water.

dfc2d207-854c-442d-a0fd-f797ff4a9d9b-0
00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:56.450
And the and and he had the boy
with the purple marker drew a.

f7a6d4aa-5374-4d3c-b8bb-1a4cbcd6d63b-0
00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:02.472
I'm gonna say Flying dragon or
something. And so they fly off,

f7a6d4aa-5374-4d3c-b8bb-1a4cbcd6d63b-1
00:44:02.472 --> 00:44:04.350
the two boys and the dad.

651b2e50-f0df-4a4f-8930-ce95ce1c70b9-0
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:10.320
And you can see the castle down
below getting smaller, or the

651b2e50-f0df-4a4f-8930-ce95ce1c70b9-1
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.060
town, whatever that is.

80752516-6cea-45a2-b2db-784f1e88c0e5-0
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.870
Hmm.

66be5962-5ef1-40e9-9640-370cf359e9b9-0
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.970
And here.

fd7bb4e6-149a-4dec-9ace-ec1638226c28-0
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:27.340
The boat. I see the boat, I see
the castle in the background.

32fb869d-43e7-4afa-a503-1edbae599e46-0
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.120
Hmm, the guy.

84059d72-8979-411d-a4d4-bcd67a160dc2-0
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.490
With the contraption thing.

a87a0166-5cd2-4d59-801f-24e5cae8d7b5-0
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.630
He's uh

a9a725da-ba2f-41e8-a19d-295e6cfd8a41-0
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:44.051
Looks like he's releasing all
the colors with the purple color

a9a725da-ba2f-41e8-a19d-295e6cfd8a41-1
00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:48.661
anyway. Then I see the red boat
that the boys was riding in.

a9a725da-ba2f-41e8-a19d-295e6cfd8a41-2
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:49.719
Statue on the.

2f3d12f0-e593-4f43-a96a-e9686d071dbf-0
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.200
Um castle.

6ab49364-19c7-486c-8ce9-05fb8335dded-0
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.410
And.

6cd01226-3451-4dbe-8c92-6914fdf23093-0
00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.890
I see the old man and two
guards.

d9b2f6aa-b990-4196-b1df-da7ee753fed9-0
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.900
And on this one.

9ccb05c8-33b7-4130-815d-2548eed3ff0a-0
00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.060
The dad and the two boys.

742f732e-d907-4061-b072-af9babf9c428-0
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.628
Are on this ridding horse.
Flying Horse I mean and the guy

742f732e-d907-4061-b072-af9babf9c428-1
00:45:15.628 --> 00:45:19.890
with the purple marker is
throwing his marker.

dafc2056-f5db-46f6-b056-5376f85082f2-0
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.440
At the guy with the with the
contraption.

81075b39-e3a9-4e3a-aaee-e2e846b18e94-0
00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:29.720
And I'm seeing more ohh OK and.

d243980c-95c6-4559-8c6f-ca4fad81e233-0
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.450
So the man with the contraption
is now releasing.

1081d5f0-eb01-4ca4-82b4-7536f75b111e-0
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.270
Purple feathers into the air.

3fd9fc8a-8420-4bdc-9481-f38b78316ec8-0
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:48.551
And I see the the boat, but now
it's up in the sky, so

3fd9fc8a-8420-4bdc-9481-f38b78316ec8-1
00:45:48.551 --> 00:45:55.100
apparently it flies. And the old
man, 2 guards, one of the boys.

900e39d1-5ef9-4528-aea4-8833d5275c0b-0
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:03.286

boy by the hand trying to pull

900e39d1-5ef9-4528-aea4-8833d5275c0b-1
00:46:03.286 --> 00:46:09.273
him into the boat. And the next
picture is the other boy, the

900e39d1-5ef9-4528-aea4-8833d5275c0b-2
00:46:09.273 --> 00:46:13.040
purple, red marker boy and the
dad is.

5feb3e05-4d2c-41fc-9f23-b2b230caf361-0
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.050
In the sky, I guess they're
falling, yeah.

4b43742f-a790-443d-9bcc-80979b2f2b49-0
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:30.280
Now the dad, the boy, purple
boy, and the purple.

cda8d2f4-e49d-4275-8b25-cac2fc528870-0
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:38.360
Um, bird fall into the water.
I'm seeing water. Fish.

f5ef43aa-2692-41c4-8b83-bb7803374642-0
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.010
He dropped his crown. His crown
came off his head.

65f187a5-8ef1-449b-9289-dae66a92ce7b-0
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.860
Uh some type of.

a84962a5-4baf-45d3-8597-600c730f07b2-0
00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:55.970
Structure in the water and then
the boy with the red marker.

2bf96e74-52c5-406a-b2d8-4b4407beb19f-0
00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.640
Draws, is drawing something.

f912b1f6-85e1-4e68-97d2-824835278285-0
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.500
I'm assuming it's a boat. OK, so
we're so the yeah.

17e46a9f-1408-4fd1-bda4-5f670daee062-0
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.610
And then?

63ba41b3-8519-4ccb-9f4f-3ec7877f932c-0
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.170
In this picture I just see
water.

95bfe67d-e5db-47db-8f54-0dcf8e2e6297-0
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:16.370
This stuff this in the water
like seaweed.

fb1224aa-9ee6-4393-a8f7-81c60bc4f267-0
00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:18.880
Things like that.

373b786d-a35b-4519-ae1c-b1a7f6e44c9e-0
00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:21.940
And.

9d51bc91-5995-435b-ac4f-2343212b963e-0
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:29.802
And the top of the water where
the land is coming out and then

9d51bc91-5995-435b-ac4f-2343212b963e-1
00:47:29.802 --> 00:47:32.070
now they're in a submarine.

93a956f7-d374-4b9b-8ac3-9887c634fc1d-0
00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.877
So that's what the boy with the
red marker was drawing, a

93a956f7-d374-4b9b-8ac3-9887c634fc1d-1
00:47:36.877 --> 00:47:40.802
submarine. The boy, the dad, is
downstairs controlling the

93a956f7-d374-4b9b-8ac3-9887c634fc1d-2
00:47:40.802 --> 00:47:43.330
submarine and the boy is looking
out.

5114ad9f-63a5-498c-b78c-59fb1efeb8ee-0
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:44.600
The.

02554edf-4130-4e73-aafd-561e71b57785-0
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:46.460
Periscope.

5ea87bda-68d1-44cc-9bb1-442efb94c4bf-0
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.300
Hmm.

583a2173-1584-46d5-af9b-bbc2a9784a2f-0
00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:51.880
And then,

7937c845-0c19-495e-97ba-e5576a2a00f6-0
00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.820
They land somewhere.

ea81c39f-d93f-4b64-8bcd-3622f3748301-0
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.377
I think they're on shore. I
think they're out of the water.

ea81c39f-d93f-4b64-8bcd-3622f3748301-1
00:48:02.377 --> 00:48:06.910
They see picture, a cave. They
see pictures drawn on a cave.

fa50be43-1a03-402a-8b4a-fe2a556a2489-0
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:12.736
Probably back in the days when
people had to communicate with

fa50be43-1a03-402a-8b4a-fe2a556a2489-1
00:48:12.736 --> 00:48:13.650
pictures and.

ee66e880-afb4-40a3-bb26-4b9297e9b2df-0
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.500
Then the bird. I see the bird.

c60f45f7-4a17-4070-b1ff-17ad78800665-0
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.890
I see all kinds of debris on
the.

a2d5ff7b-61ef-4c34-ae4e-5cbfd6adb55d-0
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.710
On the ground.

0a73538d-f550-4f51-bb5d-4564ef4dacea-0
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.190
And.

bd429601-43a4-4f3c-aa5e-604a00c1ccab-0
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.120
Now here.

35a434f3-b608-433c-843b-49a6cb678980-0
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.590
Hmm. OK, pictures on the wall.

467a6fa6-8e2f-44bc-a33b-f0058d163052-0
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:40.764
I'm assuming they're in The Cave
now. Still pictures on the wall,

467a6fa6-8e2f-44bc-a33b-f0058d163052-1
00:48:40.764 --> 00:48:42.000
a column, water.

a100db0c-b335-484a-8579-6ef175a8c169-0
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.690
And that's pretty much all I
see.

9e4eb9ea-83e9-4260-8752-2ceec51730cd-0
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:57.912
OK, OK, so the boy and the dad
is and the bird is in The Cave

9e4eb9ea-83e9-4260-8752-2ceec51730cd-1
00:48:57.912 --> 00:49:05.645
now and they're looking at the
pictures that was drawn on the

9e4eb9ea-83e9-4260-8752-2ceec51730cd-2
00:49:05.645 --> 00:49:08.140
ceiling of The Cave.

254aa21b-dac7-4c7b-b46a-09d2e7fb8683-0
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.890
And then I see also see a door.

1ef49148-ce93-43dd-b541-221cbfe3fc1f-0
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:19.075
Like under a little ledge, so
and then. This is the view of

1ef49148-ce93-43dd-b541-221cbfe3fc1f-1
00:49:19.075 --> 00:49:24.430
what it looks like outside from
inside The Cave.

7bc04d17-6ec4-431f-8400-a910799fa6fb-0
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:32.741
So, Umm yeah. So I see sky,
water, rocks, and the top of The

7bc04d17-6ec4-431f-8400-a910799fa6fb-1
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:33.320
Cave.

9d53c15a-f94d-41ae-9059-cdab2a9538bc-0
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.660
OK so now.

cf508f48-0bd1-4a3c-8115-530b6336524d-0
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.640
The guards, wait, the old man.

47c514bc-0ea6-4287-83ed-8a45bc61494c-0
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.190
The guy with the vacuum.

d0364196-94f5-4124-847f-0fbeb6c49e30-0
00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:54.942
Are now in front of The Cave
too. Still pictures on The Cave.

d0364196-94f5-4124-847f-0fbeb6c49e30-1
00:49:54.942 --> 00:50:00.652
The dad and the boy and the bird
are inside The Cave. Still see

d0364196-94f5-4124-847f-0fbeb6c49e30-2
00:50:00.652 --> 00:50:04.400
that door. Don't know what that
leads to.

291e680c-26eb-4af1-b3e7-24213c03d4e8-0
00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:06.600
And um.

32f1fa32-2701-44db-9118-c7e6926f904d-0
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.940
The the dad takes the one of the
markers.

e6f06bde-f44c-4b78-9e13-94fd8a6896ff-0
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:20.883
And Draw Something, begins to
Draw Something, and then he ends

e6f06bde-f44c-4b78-9e13-94fd8a6896ff-1
00:50:20.883 --> 00:50:24.180
up drawing a bird cage for the
bird.

30b8410f-8f79-4c98-a025-0a0e267bdb89-0
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:33.540
And the next picture is OK, the
bird cage.

4b9a6193-ec6c-418d-8189-0bbd68a4f9ca-0
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.740
Is a, bird is in the bird cage
the guy with the the.

2edb6818-3b2c-4848-8c7a-d1254480a5fd-0
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.760
Contraption here.

b762643c-e815-4846-881d-17f89cba1ea2-0
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.070
I guess he's trying to suck the
bird into it.

e3e44440-1ca3-475d-996b-f7f5f0584f61-0
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:55.042
And the dad and the boy is
hiding behind a pillar, looking

e3e44440-1ca3-475d-996b-f7f5f0584f61-1
00:50:55.042 --> 00:50:55.720
at him.

18123b47-fb8c-4bcd-a938-a2fadd8cd3d8-0
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:02.939
I'm seeing um, I don't see
pictures on the ceiling anymore,

18123b47-fb8c-4bcd-a938-a2fadd8cd3d8-1
00:51:02.939 --> 00:51:04.880
but water and land.

47381f39-ac28-45d5-b651-db10e778093c-0
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.340
And then the next picture the
guy catches up to the bird.

70dfcf18-ee67-4e90-b11a-013dcb963a3a-0
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.640
I guess sucks him up into the
into the contraption.

44dfdc71-b381-4336-a279-21906300ec68-0
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.760
And the dad and the boy end up

449b6e42-dbfb-49a5-b630-1b7c52785585-0
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:28.500
Capturing him in this in this
bird cage and and it looks like

449b6e42-dbfb-49a5-b630-1b7c52785585-1
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.610
he's about to free the bird from
that thing by breaking it.

d3684331-8246-431c-9500-1adf324f6687-0
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.190
Hmm.

9373176f-e67f-4747-8e84-1bb189cdb8a2-0
00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:41.180
So he breaks it. The bird is
released.

cfda9e56-96df-4bf5-8744-858dba8ca227-0
00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:46.032
Because I see a bird, I see the
flying horse, or whatever that

cfda9e56-96df-4bf5-8744-858dba8ca227-1
00:51:46.032 --> 00:51:46.220
is.

244480d8-7d45-4fa9-afbf-806e080c4668-0
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:51.300
All kinds of colors. Still see
that little door.

f72f0edc-1d27-4ae6-8d1c-2c40de203a79-0
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:58.770
Um, water and the walls of The
Cave. And over here I'm seeing

f72f0edc-1d27-4ae6-8d1c-2c40de203a79-1
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:03.230
all kinds of colors. The old
man, the boy.

e873eeb9-d1e9-4402-9430-46142fe76858-0
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:08.620
A bunch of purple butterfly, the
boat, 2 guards.

1773f06e-51be-4d49-a3ff-ec2e86fb7247-0
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:14.107
that look like they're scared.
And all kinds of butterflies.

1773f06e-51be-4d49-a3ff-ec2e86fb7247-1
00:52:14.107 --> 00:52:14.990
Butterflies.

2d9013ce-ffa7-456a-aa69-4d7ee0fb8f06-0
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.628
cricket, what did I say? That
was mosquitoes. And then of

2d9013ce-ffa7-456a-aa69-4d7ee0fb8f06-1
00:52:21.628 --> 00:52:26.980
course the ceiling of The Cave.
And outside The Cave is sky.

6a1a109e-ed5d-4c2a-9f89-843ef4a06735-0
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.250
OK, so on this one.

3c2e40ed-81bd-462e-8b63-235bf9296a31-0
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:39.060
The flying horse OK is uh, picks
up the bird cage with the with

3c2e40ed-81bd-462e-8b63-235bf9296a31-1
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:44.302
the guy in it and flies off with
it. Now you got all kinds of

3c2e40ed-81bd-462e-8b63-235bf9296a31-2
00:52:44.302 --> 00:52:47.600
different colored birds flying
around.

32a7c2a5-1eb3-47b8-a21b-42c3d0f375df-0
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.650
Um.

9d571484-bc5f-4c0b-aa9e-58d25c685a6b-0
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:56.090
The purple octopus is in the
water. The two guards is in the

9d571484-bc5f-4c0b-aa9e-58d25c685a6b-1
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:56.520
boat.

2bbc5c59-e70b-40b0-ae9e-83d417df28d7-0
00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:03.060
Going in the opposite direction
and the boy.

ee9f40f8-e7f7-42e5-ae93-03aadd5e50c1-0
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:09.400
Two, the, both boys, the dad and
the old man and the bird.

c1766fa2-3bd4-48de-8abf-4f7616d5f0da-0
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.600
Are standing there looking at
them and.

fb783da3-8c3c-410a-aaca-3f90e06a0942-0
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.370
And I also see that little door.

520a7c51-860a-474e-a10b-82a5bd7fe6ad-0
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.637
So the the in the next picture I
see a a rock with the little

520a7c51-860a-474e-a10b-82a5bd7fe6ad-1
00:53:22.637 --> 00:53:25.170
door, a pillar in the
background.

e3dcf304-ee18-40b8-bc5c-8db1f4c27e82-0
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:32.358

bird and the dad and the one boy

e3dcf304-ee18-40b8-bc5c-8db1f4c27e82-1
00:53:32.358 --> 00:53:37.030
is hugging him because he just

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:52.320
I see a red kite, building,
skyscrapers and whatnot, trees.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.580
The door leading to their house.

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:07.202
This is 3 floors and a basement,
so up on the top floor of the

f4334363-4270-4a51-b133-7527c3be01bf-1
00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:11.121

that they probably put up there
just for storage.

43be53e0-b971-47eb-9060-49b9ff009113-0
00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:20.400
The second floor is the dad's
workshop where he was drawing.

00:54:26.925 --> 00:54:32.150

floor is the staircase.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:43.410
Um, coat rack, pictures on the
wall, lamps, a table, and then

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:48.557

00:54:48.557 --> 00:54:52.913
over the stove and the
telephone. And in the basement,

a79c8574-0da1-4804-b741-e6f37eda0b95-3
00:54:52.913 --> 00:54:54.260

So we're going to do something
different. So instead of a

2d446659-4489-4526-8531-2d45294daeba-1
00:55:11.358 --> 00:55:15.793
graphic novel, this time we will
have a complex scene. Again,

2d446659-4489-4526-8531-2d45294daeba-2
00:55:15.793 --> 00:55:20.371
describe what you see in detail
and take between three and five

2d446659-4489-4526-8531-2d45294daeba-3
00:55:20.371 --> 00:55:21.230
minutes, OK?

This is called the Great
Portrait Exposition exhibition.

b1eef505-91f7-4cad-a6c2-3905683c2cad-0

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:07.926
Um, just standing there waiting
for something. Then I see a

4f905bb9-b1a6-4f45-a324-e9f1ff0af312-1
00:59:07.926 --> 00:59:13.070

00:59:22.837 --> 00:59:27.186
writing something. The next
picture, he tears out the page

4999577a-de7a-4c14-8e6e-a206355d1ffa-2
00:59:27.186 --> 00:59:28.440

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:34.130
And he makes some kind of
origami bird.

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:42.360
Hmm, I don't know. It looks like
it turns into a real bird.

0553433a-135f-4e4c-bbf2-cf3b5e3dd731-0
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.890
And now he's sitting.

60ad9b79-b79d-4b95-9d9d-6e69227065a2-0
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.190
Down.

ca8ec3da-bf7f-47ca-955b-9ed1dffd7e6f-0
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:52.613
Waiting for something looks
like. and then he's standing,

ca8ec3da-bf7f-47ca-955b-9ed1dffd7e6f-1
00:59:52.613 --> 00:59:56.130

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:03.561
Then he looks up into the sky
and releases the bird. But now

694db8ae-6ca4-4448-a813-64680720162f-1
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:09.150

They're leaving their hometown
or this wherever they're from on

7c9b334c-e14f-4d2b-8b61-d35a0ae3f734-1
01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:26.980

coming to America.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.190

b993165c-9cd4-4324-a4be-23bbddb66dd9-0
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.050
Ohh OK OK, maybe not America.

92f8c4b4-8e7d-4ce5-8b09-4665213de272-0
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:48.099
But anyway, here I see water.
Skyscrapers and buildings, birds

92f8c4b4-8e7d-4ce5-8b09-4665213de272-1
01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:49.330
in the sky.

be99ecab-68f9-42e7-9c6c-1eda266d37af-0
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.460
The people on this boat, on this
ship.

4b13e4a1-eba9-4a71-b1f6-e8432c275396-0
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.570
And um.

4667dd6d-fd01-4e13-bf2b-594c078566f3-0
01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:02.140
The pipes coming out, I guess I
don't know what comes out of

4667dd6d-fd01-4e13-bf2b-594c078566f3-1
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:02.900
there and.

cb5226b4-96fe-4389-b800-684d68045a07-0
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:09.477
Looks like and other little
boats on the water looks like

cb5226b4-96fe-4389-b800-684d68045a07-1
01:01:09.477 --> 01:01:14.630
they're waiting to dock
somewhere, and here I'm seeing.

13d66511-47e5-4376-824b-91b0a3708ec8-0
01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.930
Sky, birds in the sky.

11eaf480-3c7f-49c2-8bfe-88b738bdef02-0
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.595
A statue of two men shaking
hands. One man has a looks like

11eaf480-3c7f-49c2-8bfe-88b738bdef02-1
01:01:25.595 --> 01:01:31.870
a rat on his arm, the other one
has a bird on his shoulder.

35a4dea4-9cfb-43bd-9469-0dab34352ea3-0
01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:39.288
OK, looks like there are two
boats. Anyway, this boat has a

35a4dea4-9cfb-43bd-9469-0dab34352ea3-1
01:01:39.288 --> 01:01:45.003
suit. The one with the rat has a
suitcase, a bowl and some kind

35a4dea4-9cfb-43bd-9469-0dab34352ea3-2
01:01:45.003 --> 01:01:50.629
of Vase that you drink out of, I
guess. And the other one, the

35a4dea4-9cfb-43bd-9469-0dab34352ea3-3
01:01:50.629 --> 01:01:55.809
one with the bird, has a tea
kettle, a bucket or so, some

35a4dea4-9cfb-43bd-9469-0dab34352ea3-4
01:01:55.809 --> 01:02:01.078
type, and this triangle thing.
Then then you have a little

35a4dea4-9cfb-43bd-9469-0dab34352ea3-5
01:02:01.078 --> 01:02:03.400
ship. A ship looks like a.

2ce086de-9da8-4bc4-b24e-8079043f8feb-0
01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.558
One that you would take to go on
a cruise, you know, Titanic.

2ce086de-9da8-4bc4-b24e-8079043f8feb-1
01:02:09.558 --> 01:02:13.857
Maybe that's what this is, but
anyway. And then of course you

2ce086de-9da8-4bc4-b24e-8079043f8feb-2
01:02:13.857 --> 01:02:15.730
see the people in the boat.

adef736b-96f9-4662-9ae2-7babcd9faf7b-0
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.890
Looking ahead. Yeah.

584bee2e-8a3f-4646-8e7d-09773c6b7d7c-0
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:29.067
OK, so now the ship is I see
sky, see the sun trying to peek

584bee2e-8a3f-4646-8e7d-09773c6b7d7c-1
01:02:29.067 --> 01:02:30.890
through the sky.

e9f8e187-9535-4c95-a0e6-048dff9d0a91-0
01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:33.390
Birds.

2903333c-61d6-45c7-b16b-1fbdc71a85c1-0
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.160
A little boat, then I see a big.

930a5219-8b90-4d2b-8e7a-5839ad7cab46-0
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.410
Boat, a big, a ship.

f6a7ef27-1ef3-49d4-9107-f78239137cda-0
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.730
And um.

78975a87-3774-46c7-9e62-0695074022c6-0
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.850
This triangle in the water. I
guess that's one of those.

743cd57e-603c-4f78-a5a5-df5645036e26-0
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:54.153
Cones that guides the ships, I
think. Then the next page I see

743cd57e-603c-4f78-a5a5-df5645036e26-1
01:02:54.153 --> 01:02:58.820
the people talking amongst
themselves. Then, then the next

743cd57e-603c-4f78-a5a5-df5645036e26-2
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.328
picture some man is talking to
them through one of those

743cd57e-603c-4f78-a5a5-df5645036e26-3
01:03:03.328 --> 01:03:04.120
bullhorns.

4df2e82e-e44a-40a0-8d09-09b439370d1c-0
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:10.040
Next picture they're unlocking
the gates.

74f5df9e-8ebf-45f5-a123-cff3dc3a9f89-0
01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:17.773
To the ship. The next, this guy
picks up his suitcase. Now him

74f5df9e-8ebf-45f5-a123-cff3dc3a9f89-1
01:03:17.773 --> 01:03:23.310
and his family are headed
towards the gate. Everybody gets

74f5df9e-8ebf-45f5-a123-cff3dc3a9f89-2
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.000
off the boat ship.

8d7048f9-c43c-4db9-a792-c041f243505c-0
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.170
And now they're standing there.

d2fe382e-f2fb-4fc3-ac86-e1caaef9ec89-0
01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:32.060
Off the boat on land now.

a26c76d0-426f-4d93-933e-29b4b5d3adc5-0
01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:37.549
Because I see the boat in the
background, sky clouds, and I

a26c76d0-426f-4d93-933e-29b4b5d3adc5-1
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:40.716
guess they're waiting to see
what happens next.

a26c76d0-426f-4d93-933e-29b4b5d3adc5-2
01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:41.640
#END_arrival_2

582f04c4-0dcb-4237-b54e-d1872369d0bd-0
01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:50.110
OK. So that was this part of the
story. OK. And we've got another

582f04c4-0dcb-4237-b54e-d1872369d0bd-1
01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:50.590
part.

742623a2-641a-4b23-bdf0-9bc8e465ae51-0
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:54.610
OK.

b2f00f6f-4ef6-4c14-9aa1-73f41562e917-0
01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:59.870
#START_arrival_5 This picture I
see birds, sky.

b4af7785-3086-4e2a-abf5-eef6e6c95401-0
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:02.040
Umm.

f7ad97a9-f216-4c50-8cb8-f64d11489e6f-0
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.810
That's either the moon or the
sun.

82bbcc40-8828-4c29-ad02-77609fb684b5-0
01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.170
Umm.

5044e129-e0f1-4050-85ee-797bcb3feb0d-0
01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:16.170
A town surrounded by water.
People in a boat.

781ba385-f3d8-4dbd-ad31-f791c8ad9383-0
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.190
Buildings.

3af2bcb0-f5fc-4596-b9c7-dd1c781d2d28-0
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:22.430
Some buildings have a.

547d881c-e2a4-4c84-95af-5d715f9d5f76-0
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.980
Have a face like an owl owl's
face.

68b0ae78-630b-451d-80da-c7fa1575533f-0
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.950
And.

dc89b985-f1b3-4aa8-ba60-ee1ec3c9a587-0
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:37.350
The next picture, um, somebody's
wrapping a rope around.

2858044e-6095-41a6-b217-5691502b650f-0
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:46.630
A statue or some sort. Two men
are talking. One is.

595ae19e-e692-4273-a27f-c3962db2139c-0
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:53.556
Look like he's welcoming him
into his home. Then you got a

595ae19e-e692-4273-a27f-c3962db2139c-1
01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:57.680
boy walking up the steps
carrying something.

b195181a-f8c5-464e-89a1-6f3a8feb7a7a-0
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.650
Two animals at his feet, walking
up some steps.

9dc7d78a-e12b-432a-a123-8b57ca379da4-0
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:09.210
Then his mom or grandmother,
whoever she is, is handing him a

9dc7d78a-e12b-432a-a123-8b57ca379da4-1
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:10.380
bowl of food.

af50b8cb-cc87-4bfa-a409-784d471f81e5-0
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.160
He takes the food, gives her a
kiss.

cf6f82d9-3e90-4efe-bbe9-b65826a6dd59-0
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:17.580
And then

d25aad02-9d53-42e4-9ce4-82d13f1de6ea-0
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:21.280
The other guy, I mean. Wait a
minute.

d57dc553-190b-4354-85ae-9332333ef317-0
01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:27.274
OK, yeah, the the man is
introducing his wife, I'm

d57dc553-190b-4354-85ae-9332333ef317-1
01:05:27.274 --> 01:05:32.823
assuming to this man that he
welcomed into his home. The

d57dc553-190b-4354-85ae-9332333ef317-2
01:05:32.823 --> 01:05:38.859
woman is now inviting the man
in. Look like she's saying come

d57dc553-190b-4354-85ae-9332333ef317-3
01:05:38.859 --> 01:05:43.240
on in. So now they have drinks.
Four people.

83573b07-5878-4b1a-8708-2bc1c0d98044-0
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.294
And look like they're getting
ready to make a toast. And then

83573b07-5878-4b1a-8708-2bc1c0d98044-1
01:05:49.294 --> 01:05:53.951
they, the bowl, they start
picking out things out from the

83573b07-5878-4b1a-8708-2bc1c0d98044-2
01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:58.687
bowl. Food. Then the woman
starts to prepare the food to be

83573b07-5878-4b1a-8708-2bc1c0d98044-3
01:05:58.687 --> 01:05:59.240
cooked.

df59159e-4a6f-4cd2-ade5-f411ece273cd-0
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.140
And this picture she's um.

91c4098c-27e3-49be-9164-5474b4b89feb-0
01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:10.441
Looked like she's putting
something in some type of

91c4098c-27e3-49be-9164-5474b4b89feb-1
01:06:10.441 --> 01:06:11.220
contraption.

3be733e1-a884-4f3b-b486-f12b56e124cd-0
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:13.700
And then

d90181e9-b2b8-46e0-999c-c01811730922-0
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.100
I guess the food is done. Looked
like she's pouring gravy, uh

d90181e9-b2b8-46e0-999c-c01811730922-1
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.340
basting, basting this this bird
to eat.

a96f136a-67ba-4237-b73d-a4fa5087b394-0
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:31.110
OK, so now they are sitting at
the table, the boy.

9ba59336-3df6-454f-bcf4-cb3fe075f9cd-0
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:38.360
The man, the woman and the man
they invited in, sitting at a

9ba59336-3df6-454f-bcf4-cb3fe075f9cd-1
01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.990
table. I see table, chairs.

60dbcdb2-80ab-4989-b025-7884b7e51f99-0
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.750
These two animals.

befeff24-2ad1-4bfa-a334-86ffc5f6c66c-0
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:48.360
Which aren't one of them looks
like a cat, but it's not.

024e99f4-90f7-4e92-810c-90e382865e93-0
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.644
And the boy is feeding one of
them from his plate. Then they

024e99f4-90f7-4e92-810c-90e382865e93-1
01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:55.290
have um.

a12b13b1-8746-40ec-9126-a7e5967e3475-0
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:58.930
Table full of food.

f965c397-24f2-4a5c-ad3f-b2a6bb42d1d0-0
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.848
The father is looks like he's
opened in a bottle of champagne,

f965c397-24f2-4a5c-ad3f-b2a6bb42d1d0-1
01:07:05.848 --> 01:07:08.090
but I don't know what that is.

d0813adf-3b68-43aa-9896-737f17cec582-0
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:14.404
Then the now they're showing
pictures of the father, the

d0813adf-3b68-43aa-9896-737f17cec582-1
01:07:14.404 --> 01:07:17.130
mother, the man they invited in.

5cecc493-7e5e-4f53-aeac-b7b4b5381f1a-0
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:23.284
Laughing and talking at the
table as they eat. Now, the

5cecc493-7e5e-4f53-aeac-b7b4b5381f1a-1
01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:24.910
father, it has a.

f89707f4-e828-45a5-a007-b076b51f6091-0

Um.

b290d2de-26ed-4f00-86a6-a6feecf96ee0-0
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.040
Hmm.

64caf0db-cda4-4a47-89ee-3c748b4df2b4-0
01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:31.490
I forget what this is called.

59058500-59d8-4802-afa2-95d1e93f4ae4-0
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:33.160
But um.

41189063-17c8-4d6a-abc0-7d832fd4c09e-0
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:35.520
He's playing it.

bc8c5524-92e5-4fff-b898-d913b4a21057-0
01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.487
Um, accordion. It's called an
accordion. OK, the mother starts

bc8c5524-92e5-4fff-b898-d913b4a21057-1
01:07:41.487 --> 01:07:44.460
to play some type of wind
instrument.

c58326e3-e35a-4f50-927e-fe2b6b6dc9e9-0
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.600
But she has it up to her mouth.

159799a1-84b6-46ba-9a58-a73714f726bb-0
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.891
The little boy has some type of
string instrument with the cat

159799a1-84b6-46ba-9a58-a73714f726bb-1
01:07:52.891 --> 01:07:54.480
looking creature next to him.

a032368b-7fbb-4fbd-b219-209b8c061e24-0
01:07:57.330 --> 01:08:03.158
The man they invited in has
paper in his hand, opening it

a032368b-7fbb-4fbd-b219-209b8c061e24-1
01:08:03.158 --> 01:08:03.460
up.

0fcbdb36-834a-40d7-8947-d1398d18e8d5-0
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.450
Hmm.

f1f47268-e924-4f7d-b9ae-e344d767a638-0
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.930
OK, then he makes a oh, OK, he
makes a origami.

8e39f2fa-ab11-4b65-81d9-b07e64a1f6d0-0
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.570
Replica of that cat looking
thing.

58bda52f-165a-493f-89f6-bdc246640e35-0
01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:17.260
And gives it to the boy.

d02ba3c6-d187-4686-9cb3-52ab81c23825-0
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:21.080
And the dad is pulling out.

944446f6-6b3e-4f44-9369-ab6b83da99b8-0
01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.690
A part of something off looks
like off the stove.

f5b104ee-71ac-43bb-bb47-8d4b8616d808-0
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:34.128
The mom and dad are standing
there holding the pot and then

f5b104ee-71ac-43bb-bb47-8d4b8616d808-1
01:08:34.128 --> 01:08:39.797
the dad is holding the pot of
something. OK, then you got a

f5b104ee-71ac-43bb-bb47-8d4b8616d808-2
01:08:39.797 --> 01:08:40.270
vase.

189c088e-2190-405a-9883-d0713195a217-0
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.520
And then another picture of a
vase and a table, and then

189c088e-2190-405a-9883-d0713195a217-1
01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.085
another picture of a vase in A
frame, on a table in A frame.

189c088e-2190-405a-9883-d0713195a217-2
01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:54.450
Then

db2f1a2b-d34f-44e2-80f5-2ed228aa3486-0
01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:03.121
I guess the man is now in the
next picture is a man or boy in

db2f1a2b-d34f-44e2-80f5-2ed228aa3486-1
01:09:03.121 --> 01:09:09.470
bed waking up because he's
rubbing his eye and one of their

db2f1a2b-d34f-44e2-80f5-2ed228aa3486-2
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.000
pets.

c0ae8e1b-669e-4dc8-865f-1adb94e4ef24-0
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.080
Jumps up on the bed and it's
handing him something.

65120b6a-a859-40df-ac09-d02c5c28efa6-0
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:19.600
And then in the next picture,
the man is petting

91cc3d48-5f84-4ad6-a1e0-3893c6736523-0
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.660
The the animal.

8d7b3232-e8b1-4b8d-bbbb-1f80fcff9d72-0
01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:29.470
In the next picture he's putting
on a shirt and in the next

8d7b3232-e8b1-4b8d-bbbb-1f80fcff9d72-1
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:30.180
picture.

f089a39f-de0e-43da-afbd-13c351747ae4-0
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:37.700
Um, he's cutting something,
something edible with a knife.

bd1ca108-c99e-428a-b6c0-2ef0e28b4607-0
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.301
In the next picture, he's given
some of it to, he has a, I see

bd1ca108-c99e-428a-b6c0-2ef0e28b4607-1
01:09:44.301 --> 01:09:49.071
the man in the chair, table,
plate, and he's handing He's

bd1ca108-c99e-428a-b6c0-2ef0e28b4607-2
01:09:49.071 --> 01:09:54.171
given something to that to the
animal. Then the man that they

bd1ca108-c99e-428a-b6c0-2ef0e28b4607-3
01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:57.050
invited in is putting on his
coat.

d48bfd19-25e9-4c26-ae72-07e3447c0bd6-0
01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:03.994
Then he's standing there, then
the creature, the animal, the

d48bfd19-25e9-4c26-ae72-07e3447c0bd6-1
01:10:03.994 --> 01:10:08.240
pet, hands him his hat. So I
guess he's about to leave.

2733e66b-b785-4158-a96c-deb0b3fa2e16-0
01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.930
OK, next picture is um.

2877b6b3-6273-4f89-b694-42fc6cc429d5-0
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:19.502
I think they're back at the
ship. Well, I see Sky, banners

2877b6b3-6273-4f89-b694-42fc6cc429d5-1
01:10:19.502 --> 01:10:25.719
in the sky, maybe not back at
the ship. And people carrying

2877b6b3-6273-4f89-b694-42fc6cc429d5-2
01:10:25.719 --> 01:10:28.620
suitcases and bags, animals.

a83e5e48-8d74-4c37-aa4e-76a49c856e7a-0
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:36.220
And in the next picture I see
the same man with the pet.

775ad73d-0cb5-4378-86de-7f766c969069-0
01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:44.130
Walk up to a door with a man who
is a cook.

fcec3e11-4085-44be-89f8-73ea05e11e5f-0
01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.370
Yeah, as he's holding a pot, he
has on a chef's hat.

8a65e7a8-e9ed-4f27-8613-23408f1c8b08-0
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.630

A man who looks like he's fixing
something, fixing a.

417baaa1-3d00-46ef-a80c-82eba445ed4c-0
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.658
Some kind of some kind of
contraption, and he has a pet

417baaa1-3d00-46ef-a80c-82eba445ed4c-1
01:11:07.658 --> 01:11:08.510
with him.

8a278039-03ff-462a-b567-345426e92b09-0
01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:13.720
The man, and with the hat, it's
standing there with his pet.

8a278039-03ff-462a-b567-345426e92b09-1
01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.372
He's saying something to the man
and the man has his hand up like

8a278039-03ff-462a-b567-345426e92b09-2
01:11:18.372 --> 01:11:19.430
he's saying no.

4eee00c6-93f2-4f28-af3d-23690a9b4785-0
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.400
And in the next picture I see.

73a8e842-3489-410b-8d1e-72fdb0cc6628-0

Umm.

1a5fc1a9-6760-4e6c-8d7e-6196c35b9716-0
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:34.995
What is that? Some kind
something in the background,

1a5fc1a9-6760-4e6c-8d7e-6196c35b9716-1
01:11:34.995 --> 01:11:39.560
buildings I guess, and it looks
like they're pulling a rope.

1a5fc1a9-6760-4e6c-8d7e-6196c35b9716-2
01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.200
Three men are pulling a rope. In
the next picture I see fish.

8ae10ee7-8361-4d13-a6b8-de53f5bb9377-0
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:51.356
With a man with a big basket and
I don't know if he's feeding the

8ae10ee7-8361-4d13-a6b8-de53f5bb9377-1
01:11:51.356 --> 01:11:51.800
fish.

e5dbd7c3-25d7-4da6-97ef-b6a5be830b15-0
01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:58.226
Or cooking them. OK and then in
the next picture I see three

e5dbd7c3-25d7-4da6-97ef-b6a5be830b15-1
01:11:58.226 --> 01:11:58.810
people.

58dedf86-db73-4a76-a0fa-877f2724fdbd-0
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.913
Two women and a man, same cook,
the cook I saw another picture,

58dedf86-db73-4a76-a0fa-877f2724fdbd-1
01:12:06.913 --> 01:12:08.030
I think and.

3e1e7c10-1d89-427a-8e08-4315e5dcd66f-0
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:11.490
She's buying something because
she's giving her money.

a3fff90a-cb8e-4d40-8065-189ede328578-0
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.630
And in the next picture I see a
man sitting down.

703f3fa8-e929-400d-86c8-6d5c1741c607-0
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:26.203
Trying to he has a wrench in his
hand, looks like. So he might be

703f3fa8-e929-400d-86c8-6d5c1741c607-1
01:12:26.203 --> 01:12:30.785
trying to fix something. Then in
the next picture I see a man on

703f3fa8-e929-400d-86c8-6d5c1741c607-2
01:12:30.785 --> 01:12:31.420
a ladder.

3de5b364-43ed-45fb-aa4a-6843a5d1fa8e-0
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:37.618
And he's painting something on
the wall. Next picture is a

3de5b364-43ed-45fb-aa4a-6843a5d1fa8e-1
01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:40.190
woman and some type of cart.

d061feb4-8b0a-42c7-ba89-8617a8c9c773-0
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.540
And.

7a4abf79-a349-4db3-adc2-934e177435c6-0
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:49.070
Yeah, and a cart. This next
picture is the man with the hat.

41fbe517-ff90-4ede-afc2-c1ef5a2abeb3-0
01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.250
A woman.

df6aa5ed-f590-44d6-85f9-cd083bcfc899-0
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.320
Uh.

2c61af04-148a-40ba-a8ea-7d9751a20390-0
01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.844
Jars and and and everything
containers on the, on the

2c61af04-148a-40ba-a8ea-7d9751a20390-1
01:12:59.844 --> 01:13:01.510
shelves, on the wall.

16619545-4415-4e40-a170-12db93b12919-0
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.471
Whatever he's saying to her,
she's saying no. And then I also

16619545-4415-4e40-a170-12db93b12919-1
01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:09.950

bde9ccf8-5fdf-425e-80d4-0142fadd4410-0
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.520
Hmm, something sticking up out
of them. I don't know if that's

bde9ccf8-5fdf-425e-80d4-0142fadd4410-1
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.340
the best food or what. Then in
the next picture I see.

e6394cec-80fb-4de7-bea5-e9e42da9cf22-0
01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.350
I guess these are hot air
balloons.

66889930-7af2-41c4-92b6-a591ed007f1a-0
01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:30.810
OK, but they haven't taken off
yet and.

e8324c86-2fcd-4777-bd90-882e3116ed93-0
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:34.570
Picture of the man with the hat
and his pet.

brooms sweeping the ground.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.470

something. #END_arrival_5

e0f947d4-e167-4b68-b7de-4da2daaa5cea-0
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:54.050
Hmm. So that was this part of
the story.

f7cab1f4-7492-4a0c-8ed4-4ae69e20ae62-0
01:13:57.230 --> 01:14:01.100
This will be the last one we do.
It has 2 pages, OK.

d14f6b02-a977-4551-a7c1-72fd389c8e6a-0
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.750
Oh, not 2 pages. Let me
actually, this will be

d14f6b02-a977-4551-a7c1-72fd389c8e6a-1
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:07.390
everything we do today.
