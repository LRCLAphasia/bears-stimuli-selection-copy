00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.400
The kids look at the map.

76fbe4a2-7b48-4ce3-b7d6-bdd0f3cf206d-0
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:29.140
Different places on it, and
they're pointing at something.

9eaf6959-5c0d-4f53-8da4-08e6de261568-0
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.450
Well, the kids. Well, the kids
looking at a map.

b94e4512-d4b0-47a5-92c8-e5765b2bbc95-0
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:41.030

traveling farther away and.

2a2c540c-aea9-42db-ab8e-96484362563c-0
00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.116
Only looking at the map closer
and they're trying to figure out

2a2c540c-aea9-42db-ab8e-96484362563c-1
00:42:45.116 --> 00:42:47.940
where they gotta go. They find
the king and help him.

6920ac51-8200-4f94-99ca-3ecbade123d4-0
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.250
Different color rainbows in the
map.

9ee400ed-acf8-415f-8777-071f47cf4bf6-0
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.350
Stuff like that. Different
places.

ec68b1ae-766f-41ab-ae42-ee72137912b9-0
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.180
Very colorful.

c124f53d-85ef-465f-ac6e-9b58e60d5a7f-0
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.180
So I guess, um.

61e7fa83-2666-4510-b9c1-cea325ad0602-0
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.960
They get to the rock. They on
the rock.

d2383716-ad87-4c04-b3d1-030097cd7ba9-0
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.290
And now?

08e7ef5f-dce6-46b7-9875-c31f7cc153c2-0
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.340
Guess the.

5d640090-1a7f-4482-9587-b63d5d7d0029-0
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.200
For all different things that
can help them.

5f10e48b-85cf-4841-9b5c-89e2afb8873c-0
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:22.020
Why they on this rock and they
jumping, they jump in the ocean.

5e6ddd0b-57fe-41ef-bde4-c3bd7f676a7e-0
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.480
Or the water with your bird to
go on there adventure.

b26266c7-a2b9-4ac9-becf-98583e8668e2-0
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.850
OK, we'll look for this.

b90fd2ae-a7ec-4c5a-b07a-793c8e9ad949-0
00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.180
So so.

4ad63174-2d86-46c8-a359-c24fdd07dc53-0
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:40.420
There in the Ocean hall and on
with their bird what hold on to.

1b7673d7-013b-47cb-b42b-c352de215036-0
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.590
Holding on to tentacles of the.

0ecb8c97-98b4-41ee-aa44-10e5cac83ecd-0
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.644
This type of creature, maybe a
squid down to this underwater

0ecb8c97-98b4-41ee-aa44-10e5cac83ecd-1
00:43:49.644 --> 00:43:50.060
city.

d9bc3ac6-2ff0-4210-b1a4-221aedea0f6b-0
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.080
To follow King or.

0a6eee88-138e-4911-87a1-8366049dbc25-0
00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.177
See wherever they can see it's
underwater Kingdom it's a lot of

0a6eee88-138e-4911-87a1-8366049dbc25-1
00:44:00.177 --> 00:44:03.640
fish with some fish is floating
around somewhere around.

7c0b4a77-0257-4a5b-b32f-07e7cfb146c4-0
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.909
So I guess they get to this, get
to where they're going on to

7c0b4a77-0257-4a5b-b32f-07e7cfb146c4-1
00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:17.260
this.

5013fce8-cb00-41ad-af4d-aa2434e28a8f-0
00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.190
Underwater.

2791900b-1472-4838-aba9-7865285f3ec2-0
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.492
City. Whatever they find some
type of treasure or something

2791900b-1472-4838-aba9-7865285f3ec2-1
00:44:23.492 --> 00:44:24.180
that they need.

926ec485-7af3-4c86-9ba1-8d18a015a873-0
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.410
So they gather it up to.

aa9a568a-96bc-40e5-91eb-cc326d74b0ab-0
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.290
Boy and girl.

f741d082-462e-4070-b016-84ee482db6f5-0
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.290
Then soldiers come and.

22d1b45b-904c-4f5f-b0ff-bac8b5deb26e-0
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.555
Go after them with Spears and
stuff and they're running. They

22d1b45b-904c-4f5f-b0ff-bac8b5deb26e-1
00:44:39.555 --> 00:44:43.010
aren't. They hold on to the
tentacles of the.

d28b4711-de8f-469b-96ab-9a792e4b2dff-0
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.240
Purple squirt to run away to go
somewhere else. Next adventure.

f470160b-8a30-4013-b678-487238dcf0c2-0
00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.061
So they made it out of water and
they're going into the trunk

f470160b-8a30-4013-b678-487238dcf0c2-1
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:02.330
with the palm trees with their
bird.

3082eda7-305e-488b-9085-f3ce5fe3ac67-0
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.410
Hey

906f00d1-2c9c-4643-9dd7-da0d5e8745f6-0
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.030
Now the boarding girl drawing
something on the wall.

9dab10d3-be63-4cff-ab2e-a34f73fb23c1-0
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.870
So.

6bb2ae83-4fb2-417d-86b1-d8745cb15de6-0
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.387
Red and purple crayon. Wonder
what they're going to what's it

6bb2ae83-4fb2-417d-86b1-d8745cb15de6-1
00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:21.090
going to be?

f5dbccc0-7785-4326-b64f-c92d59694324-0
00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.130
I guess they're riding. We'll
draw that.

76a38168-4605-4fbe-bb11-e2e4c357c84f-0
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.930
Rhinoceros with a bed.

0061569c-28cd-4677-ad1c-680dcfdd8626-0
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.826
Sitting on top of XXX and
walking past statues. Going to

0061569c-28cd-4677-ad1c-680dcfdd8626-1
00:45:40.826 --> 00:45:44.430
some type of pyramid that's
ancient in the middle.

049abb25-2ca2-44bc-9146-e7526cc3c9e1-0
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.960
Force.

510e7b9d-2d83-47cf-8613-1181fb232128-0
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:53.063
You can see different type of
buildings in other parts of the

510e7b9d-2d83-47cf-8613-1181fb232128-1
00:45:53.063 --> 00:45:54.530
jungle, waterfall.

ba35f706-a495-4bde-8e24-e8ccce268bae-0
00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:02.250
Ohh drawbridge mean bridge. A
rope bridge leading somewhere.

03fe8537-36f1-401d-8ced-2c7e0970c543-0
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.020
Move.

999ab2bc-4009-4afd-8df8-983c95e93c7c-0
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:18.688
So they run across this rope
bridge with the bird purple bird

999ab2bc-4009-4afd-8df8-983c95e93c7c-1
00:46:18.688 --> 00:46:20.070
to this building.

2a5bd0bc-b7e2-491f-805c-772706658349-0
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.660
They never seen before.

25e802ed-41c6-427d-b1f6-c281cc5dddfe-0
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.654
Looks for the ancient there.
Well, I know why I haven't been

25e802ed-41c6-427d-b1f6-c281cc5dddfe-1
00:46:27.654 --> 00:46:29.530
there for a really long time.

87266d32-2976-45df-862f-1e166d5bbbc4-0
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.680
Some light on top of the
building.

dc14cbf3-e0af-4674-840d-b0c52814da4d-0
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.130
Now they're drawing things again
now.

3cb65472-4adc-48f3-bcac-55b93488d7e2-0
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.050
Crayon.

b8fb51dc-aa0c-4d9d-b3cc-19340b65a91f-0
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.974
Wonder what it will be. So I
guess there's something that

b8fb51dc-aa0c-4d9d-b3cc-19340b65a91f-1
00:46:46.974 --> 00:46:49.100
helped him get to where they
need to.

8fe70606-d387-4170-8a58-cec1dc556fb8-0
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.810
Go to.

81ba22dc-85dd-474b-934f-bf0696c1664f-0
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.220
Hmm.

22eed902-be33-4b36-8471-ac8aff3be7cd-0
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.690
Well.

812c6ed6-8e77-4012-9d3e-9132fa539e65-0
00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.310
I guess they're on a swing.

99222a54-792a-41db-9652-3650e498ed2b-0
00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.630
Playing around with the soldier.

530acc5e-03a2-4ebc-8e06-58a3da9dfe1b-0
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.680
Dragonfly.

80711cdf-bbb7-4021-bf2a-676bfbd1b43a-0
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.310
Purple dragonflies taking past
some.

3510d06a-f9de-4ac7-86c7-5544af99ccc7-0
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.030
To some Big Blue mountains.

93d65645-ad13-403a-bb0c-c8fa43befc25-0
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.230
Purple Dragonfly left him off on
top of a roof.

275257d4-bf31-46f9-8c44-eb59f1d4d1be-0
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.560
The roof.

a3674cd5-533f-491f-966d-ab3921102ec5-0
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:35.590
Yes, some type of statue
soldiers are following.

6973d338-9d53-4a8b-98bf-7ea9e561c0e4-0
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:43.842
OK, looking at the crayons and
see what which one they need

6973d338-9d53-4a8b-98bf-7ea9e561c0e4-1
00:47:43.842 --> 00:47:48.511
next and they boy still has the
map they're buying somewhere

6973d338-9d53-4a8b-98bf-7ea9e561c0e4-2
00:47:48.511 --> 00:47:49.200
else now.

6448d9bd-0744-4a8e-a2e1-4511a394c7f8-0
00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:59.190
The soldiers.

a0586ab6-baa3-4729-a0f3-da7c9974ed9d-0
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.510
I guess his soldiers, I think
they have them captured.

ddd46389-2be2-48a5-84ee-1e416b67b54c-0
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.730
They got them surrounded.

102a5c68-0998-4abd-b7a9-41128a0dbdb1-0
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.710
There's no place to go, least
that we think.

e65b1ac0-ae86-4c6c-955f-117ae7495be5-0
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.460
Like many other soldiers just
coming to surround them.

a54e5ad5-e13d-490a-9fb2-166afe5d7eb5-0
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:17.820
What will they do?

80a02496-84f1-4ecb-9df4-bf6a6a2934dc-0
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.520
The bird snatches the crayons
and takes off.

11db61b5-e3cf-45ac-b3b5-2c3b522970bf-0
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.540
With the rainbow.

15e7d16b-1b90-4cf4-8f9d-e1a65d77b811-0
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.980
Leaving behind them and.

66b56d0e-deef-4b09-9ced-a354582379fc-0
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.741
Someone in the boats, fall out
of the sky, cause of the burst

66b56d0e-deef-4b09-9ced-a354582379fc-1
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:45.640
of the rainbow.

87d1b1ad-feda-49ff-873a-4598c145d497-0
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.540
His bird goes to some to some
city.

cfa8b454-3d48-4ac0-9164-37e4fad737d5-0
00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:58.880
But the crayons.

52c12093-daeb-4182-b8dd-3923f4841ca5-0
00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:08.880
So the bird goes to the city.

2b128450-b23c-4af5-9e97-191fe51c78b5-0
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.020
with the crayons.

c9a6741e-c19f-493c-adbf-13abeab80446-0
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.613
With the rainbow leaving behind
them with a burst of rainbow

c9a6741e-c19f-493c-adbf-13abeab80446-1
00:49:18.613 --> 00:49:21.760
hitting the the boat knocks off
the soldiers.

be7e9daf-5c21-4acc-82ea-41dd6a073038-0
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.330
Save the King with the people on
their way to somewhere.

0785e22e-d4fd-4b33-bd29-c224afe9cc0c-0
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.470
At a far away land.

54ffbf7b-a1e2-4563-9d29-0fef2d8aeda7-0
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.830
Guess he saved them.

2cf0eb0e-3b39-49e4-ab8d-1adc42cd4905-0
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.625
OK, I guess they have a parade.
They have a parade for the kids

2cf0eb0e-3b39-49e4-ab8d-1adc42cd4905-1
00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:48.004
and the king for saving the
kings. There's a rainbow in the

2cf0eb0e-3b39-49e4-ab8d-1adc42cd4905-2
00:49:48.004 --> 00:49:48.230
sky.

e91e53a9-2076-448c-8409-2d8ad91f3ca0-0
00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.060
