isPicturable: put a 1 for picturable nouns. put a 0 for nouns that are not picturable. Picturable
nouns are nouns that are easily shown only with a picture. For example, tree is a picturable noun. Resilience is not a picturable noun. Put a 2 if unsure. Do not leave blank. Most proper names are not picturable (“Will”… which one?). Some aren’t picturable (e.g., “Waldo”). We probably don’t want to use those, but for now, mark them as 2 for unsure. 

notNoun: put a 1 if the word is not a noun. Otherwise put a 0. 

checkThisWord: put a 1 if something odd has happened and we need to check where
this word came from. This could be because its not actually a word, or perhaps it
looks like a combination of 2 words and there was no space betweeen them (This excludes
compound words).. Or perhaps when the word was converted to a lemma, something weird happened.
Otherwise put 0. 

duplicateOf: if there is another version of this same word already in this stimulus spreadsheet,
