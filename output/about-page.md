### Getting Started

To get started using the app, enter a participant ID, and select a naming ability that was generated from the PNT. The naming ability score must be between -4 and 4. After entering these values, you can hit the 'Select Stimuli' button.

The additional choices in the bottom of the sidebar menu are there in case we need to make minor adjustments to the parameters that affect stimuli selection (for example, if we needed to relax the agreement criteria to pull from additional eligible items.

In the hopefully rare case that someone is too mild and we can't generate enough discourse items for them, you can set the 'Min number of discourse stimuli (0 = naming only)' field to 0. This will produce three balanced lists for naming items ignoring the discourse task entirely.

When you've selected your stimuli, you can preview them in the 'Preview stimuli' tab which shows the essential columns. you can download this file using the 'download stimuli button. Note that the downloaded file includes additional columns which are necessary for full reproducibility.

At this stage, the conditions are only a value of '1', '2', and '3' but are not yet assigned to experimental conditions. The plan for this step is to do it in redcap? The generate input tab includes a brief table of which stimuli are included in each yet-to-be-assigned condition. Once you're ready, use this tab to assign an experimental condition (effort maximized, accuracy maximized, effort-accuracy balanced) to each condition. You can then generate the input file for the web app and download this file. It should be saved along with the stimuli selection file as it documents the condition assignments.

If you need to, you can upload a downloaded stimuli file later (bottom left of page), and then make the condition assignments - they don't need to be done right away.

Please contact Rob with any issues/bugs. This app is still experimental.
